C, May 27, 1899_.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to transmit herewith for republication a manual\r\nentitled, The Honey Bee: A Manual of Instruction in Apiculture, by\r\nMr. Frank Benton, who has been in charge of the apiarian work of\r\nthis Division for several years. The constant demand for information\r\nconcerning bee culture for a long time indicated a need for such a\r\npublic manual, and the work was begun and nearly completed under the\r\ndirection of my predecessor, Dr. G. V. Riley. The manuscript was\r\nsubmitted September 20, 1895, and the edition of 1,000 copies was soon\r\nexhausted. In April, 1896, Congress ordered a reprint of 20,000 copies,\r\nin which some corrections and additions were made by the author. He has\r\nalso taken advantage of the reprint of another (the third) edition to\r\nmake some slight additional changes.\r\n\r\nThe apiarian industry in the United States is practically a development\r\nof the last forty years, although isolated individuals were engaged in\r\nthis work long prior to that time. The importance of the industry at\r\nthe present day is not generally realized, and the following figures\r\nwill probably be surprising to many well-informed individuals:\r\n\r\n  Apiarian societies in the United States                              110\r\n  Apiarian journals                                                      8\r\n  Steam factories for the manufacture of beehives and apiarian\r\n    implements                                                          15\r\n  Honey produced in the United States in 1869 (according to\r\n    United States Census Report)                         pounds 14,702,815\r\n  Honey produced in the United States in 1889 (according to\r\n    United States Census Report)                        pounds  63,894,186\r\n  Persons engaged in the culture of bees (estimated)               300,000\r\n  Honey and wax produced, at wholesale rates (Eleventh Census)  $7,000,000\r\n  Mr. Benton's estimate of the present annual value of\r\n    apiarian products                                          $20,000,000\r\nAs supplementary to these figures it may be stated that in addition\r\nto the 15 steam-power factories there is a very largo number of smaller\r\nfactories, using mainly hand and horse power, which are engaged in the\r\nproduction of supplies, such as hives, smokers, honey extractors, sections,\r\ncomb foundation, and other apiarian apparatus. It is estimated\r\nby Mr. Benton that the present existing flora of the United States\r\ncould undoubtedly support, with the same average profit, ten times the\r\nnumber of colonies of bees it now supports. This branch of agricultural\r\nindustry does not impoverish the soil in the least, but, on the\r\ncontrary, results in better seed and fruit crops. The total money gain\r\nto the country from the prosecution of this industry would undoubtedly\r\nbe placed at several times the amount given in the table above\r\nwere we only able to estimate in dollars and cents the result of the\r\nwork of bees in cross fertilizing the blossoms of fruit crops. In support\r\nof this it is only necessary to refer to the fact that recent investigations\r\nby another division of this Department have shown that\r\ncertain varieties of pear are nearly or quite sterile unless bees bring\r\npollen from other distinct varieties for their complete cross fertilization.\r\nI respectfully recommend the publication of this manual as No. 1 of\r\nthe new series of bulletins of this Division.\r\n\r\n        Respectfully,                         L. O. Howard,\r\n                                                   _Entomologist_.\r\n    Hon. James Wilson,\r\n          _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis treatise is designed to make the practical management of an apiary\r\nplain to those whose acquaintance with the subject is limited, and to\r\ndirect such as may find in it a pleasant and profitable occupation to\r\na system of management which may be followed on an extensive scale\r\nwith the certainty of fair remuneration for the labor and capital\r\nrequired. With this object in view the author has deemed it best to\r\ntreat the natural history of the bee but briefly, and also to give\r\nlittle space to matters which are in question, or to different methods\r\nof accomplishing given results, or to such as are only adapted to a\r\nlimited portion of the country, but rather to explain one settled way\r\nwidely applicable and which will lead to success. The methods advised\r\nhere are such as the author has found practical during an extended\r\nexperience, yet in regard to numerous details many works--both foreign\r\nand American--have been consulted, none more freely than Langstroth on\r\nthe Honey Bee, revised by Chas. Dadant & Son, and Bees and Bee Keeping,\r\nby Prof. F. R. Cheshire.\r\n\r\nMany of the illustrations were specially prepared for this bulletin.\r\nSome have been taken from publications of the Department of\r\nAgriculture. These include some of the smaller illustrations of\r\nhoney-producing plants and also Plates III to X, which are from reports\r\nof the Botanist of the Department. Plates II and XI, and figures 5, 6,\r\n8, 44, 50, 51, and 76 are copied from Cheshire; figs. 08 and 69 from\r\nSimmins. The Department is also under obligations to the A. I. Root\r\nCompany, to Chas. Dadant & Son, T. F. Bingham, Hayek Bros., Tan Allen &\r\nWilliams, and Dr. T. L. Tinker, for electrotypes.\r\n\r\n                                                          Frank Benton.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D.

It is not to be understood that such knowledge will\r\ntake the place of an acquaintance with those conditions under which\r\nactual practice has shown that bees thrive, but that it forms a good\r\nbasis for an understanding of whatever practice has found best in the\r\nmanagement of these industrious and profitable insects. It will also\r\nassist in pointing out in what way practice can be improved.\r\n\r\nIn a small treatise like the present one, the object of which is to\r\ngive in plain language the information needed by one who engages in\r\nbee keeping primarily for profit, it is not possible to do more than\r\npresent a mere outline of classification and a few general facts\r\nregarding structure. The reader who finds them interesting and valuable\r\nin his work is reminded that the treatment of these matters in more\r\nextended volumes, such as Langstroth's, Cheshire's, etc., will be found\r\nfar more so.\r\n\r\nSingling out from the order Hymenoptera, or membranous-winged insects,\r\nthe family Apidæ, or bee family, several marked types called genera are\r\nseen to compose it, such as _Apis_ (the hive bee), _Bombus_ (the bumble\r\nbee), _Xylocopa_ (the carpenter bee), _Megachile_ (the leaf-cutter),\r\n_Melipona_ (the stingless honey bee of the American tropics), etc. All\r\nof these are very interesting to study, and each fulfills a purpose\r\nin the economy of nature; but the plan of these pages can only be\r\nto consider the first genus, _Apis_, or the hive bee. Incidentally\r\nit may be mentioned that the plan of introducing the stingless bees\r\n(_Melipona_) from tropical America has frequently been brought up with\r\nthe expectation of realizing important practical results from it. These\r\nbees might possibly be kept in the warmer portions of our country, but\r\ntheir honey yield is small, not well ripened, and not easily harvested\r\nin good shape, since the honey cells are of dark wax, like that made\r\nby our bumble bees, and they are not arranged in regular order, but in\r\nirregular clumps like those of bumble bees. The writer had a colony\r\nunder observation last year, and experiments have been made with them\r\nin their native lands as well as in European countries. Of the genus\r\n_Apis_ the only representative in this country is _mellifera_, although\r\nseveral others are natives of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE COMMON EAST INDIAN HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\n                         (_Apis indica_ Fab.)\r\n\r\nThe common bee of southern Asia is kept in very limited numbers and\r\nwith a small degree of profit in earthen jars and sections of hollow\r\ntrees in portions of the British and Dutch East Indies. They are also\r\nfound wild, and build when in this state in hollow trees and in rock\r\nclefts. Their combs, composed of hexagonal wax cells, are ranged\r\nparallel to each other like those of _A. mellifera_, but the worker\r\nbrood cells are smaller than those of our ordinary bees, showing 36 to\r\nthe square inch of surface instead of 29, while the comb where worker\r\nbrood is reared, instead of having, like that of _A. mellifera_, a\r\nthickness of seven-eighths inch, is but five-eighths inch thick. (Fig.\r\n1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Worker cells of common East Indian honey bee\r\n(_Apis indica_); natural size. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n_The workers._--The bodies of these, three-eighths inch long when\r\nempty, measure about one-half inch when dilated with honey. The thorax\r\nis covered with brownish hair and the shield or crescent between the\r\nwings is large and yellow. The abdomen is yellow underneath. Above it\r\npresents a ringed appearance, the anterior part of each segment being\r\norange yellow, while the posterior part shows bands of brown of greater\r\nor less width and covered with whitish-brown hairs; tip black. They are\r\nnimble on foot and on the wing, and active gatherers.\r\n\r\n_The queens._--The queens are large in proportion to their workers and\r\nare quite prolific; color, leather or dark coppery.\r\n\r\n_The drones._--These are only slightly larger than the workers; color,\r\njet-like blue black, with no yellow, their strong wings showing\r\nchanging hues like those of wasps.\r\n\r\nManipulations with colonies of these bees are easy to perform if smoke\r\nbe used, and though they are more excitable than our common hive bees,\r\nthis peculiarity does not lead them to sting more, but seems rather to\r\nproceed from fear. The sting is also less severe.\r\n\r\nUnder the rude methods thus far employed in the management of this bee\r\nno great yields of honey are obtained, some 10 or 12 pounds having been\r\nthe most reported from a single hive. It is quite probable that if\r\nimported into this country it would do more. These bees would no doubt\r\nvisit many small flowers not frequented by the hive bees we now have,\r\nand whose nectar is therefore wasted, but very likely they might not\r\nwithstand the severe winters of the North unless furnished with such\r\nextra protection as would be afforded by quite warm cellars or special\r\nrepositories.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE TINY EAST INDIAN HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\n                         (_Apis florea_ Fab.)\r\n\r\nThis bee, also a native of East India, is the smallest known species of\r\nthe genus. It builds in the open air, attaching a single comb to a twig\r\nof a shrub or small tree. This comb is only about the size of a man's\r\nhand and is exceedingly delicate, there being on each side 100 worker\r\ncells to the square inch of surface (figs. 2 and 3). The workers, more\r\nslender than house flies, though longer bodied, are blue-black in\r\ncolor, with the anterior third of the abdomen bright orange. Colonies\r\nof these bees accumulate so little surplus honey as to give no hope\r\nthat their cultivation would be profitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 2.--Worker cells of tiny East Indian honey bee\r\n(_Apis florea_); natural size. (Original).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE GIANT EAST INDIAN HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\n                         (_Apis dorsata_ Fab.)\r\n\r\nThis large bee (Plate I, figs. 2 and 3), which might not be\r\ninappropriately styled the Giant East Indian bee, has its home also\r\nin the far East--both on the continent of Asia and the adjacent\r\nislands. There are probably several varieties, more or less marked, of\r\nthis species, and very likely _Apis zonata_ Guér. of the Philippine\r\nIslands, reported to be even larger than _A. dorsata_, will prove on\r\nfurther investigation to be only a variety of the latter. All the\r\nvarieties of these bees build huge combs of very pure wax--often 5\r\nto 6 feet in length and 3 to 4 feet in width, which they attach to\r\noverhanging ledges of rocks or to large limbs of lofty trees in the\r\nprimitive forests or jungles. When attached to limbs of trees they\r\nare built singly and present much the same appearance as those of the\r\ntiny East Indian bee, shown in the accompanying figure (fig. 3). The\r\nGiant bee, however, quite in contradistinction to the other species of\r\nApis mentioned here, does not construct larger cells in which to rear\r\ndrones, these and the workers being produced in cells of the same size.\r\nOf these bees--long a sort of a myth to the bee keepers of America and\r\nEurope--strange stories have been told. It has been stated that they\r\nbuild their combs horizontally, after the manner of paper-making wasps;\r\nthat they are so given to wandering as to make it impossible to keep\r\nthem in hives, and that their ferocity renders them objects greatly\r\nto be dreaded. The first real information regarding these points was\r\ngiven by the author, lb 4 visited India in 1880-81 for the purpose\r\nof obtaining colonies of _Apis dorsata_. These were procured in the\r\njungles, cutting the combs from their original attachments, and it was\r\nthus ascertained that (as might have been expected in the case of any\r\nspecies of Apis), their combs are always built perpendicularly; also\r\nthat the colonies placed in frame hives and permitted to fly freely\r\ndid not desert these habitations and that, far from being ferocious,\r\nthese colonies were easily handled by proper precautions, without even\r\nthe use of smoke. It was also proved by the quantity of honey and wax\r\npresent that they are good gatherers. The execution at that time of the\r\nplan of bringing these bees to the United States was prevented only by\r\nsevere illness contracted in India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Comb of tiny East Indian honey bee (_Apis\r\nflorea_) one-third natural sized. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThese large bees would doubtless be able to get honey from flowers\r\nwhose nectaries are located out of reach of ordinary bees, notably\r\nthose of the red clover, now visited chiefly by bumble bees and which\r\nit is thought the East Indian bees might pollinate and cause to produce\r\nseed more abundantly. Even if no further utilizable, they might prove\r\nan important factor in the production in the Southern States of large\r\nquantities of excellent beeswax, now such an expensive article. Should\r\nthese bees and the common East Indian bee (_Apis indica_), previously\r\nreferred to, visit in the main only such flowers as are not adapted\r\nto our hive bees, their introduction, wherever it could be made\r\nsuccessful, would, without decreasing the yield from our hive bees, add\r\nmaterially to the honey and wax production of the country. Theoretical\r\nconclusions as to the results of such an introduction can not be of\r\nmuch account unless based upon an intimate acquaintance with the nature\r\nand habits of the bees to be introduced. Enough is known of the small\r\nbee to remove all doubt regarding the possibility of its successful\r\nintroduction, and it is also probable that the large one would prove\r\nvaluable. In neither case does there appear any possibility that evil\r\nresults might follow their introduction. There are also numerous other\r\nvarieties or species of bees in Africa and Asia about which no more or\r\neven less is known, but to investigate them fully will require much\r\ntime and considerable expense. It is a subject, however, that should\r\nreceive careful consideration because of the possible benefits to\r\napiculture and the wider beneficial effects on agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE COMMON HIVE OR HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\n                       (_Apis mellifera_ Linn.)\r\n\r\nBesides the common brown or German bee imported from Europe to this\r\ncountry some time in the seventeenth century and now widely spread from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific, several other races have been brought\r\nhere--the Italian in 1860, and later the Egyptian, the Cyprian, the\r\nSyrian, the Palestine, the Carniolan (Plate I, figs. 1, 4, and 5), and\r\nthe Tunisian. Of these the brown or German, the Italian, and, in a few\r\napiaries, the Carniolan bees are probably the only races existing pure\r\nin the United States, the others having become more or less hybridized\r\nwith the brown race or among themselves or their cultivation having\r\nbeen discontinued. It should also be remarked that so few have kept\r\ntheir Carniolans pure that purchasers who wish this race should use\r\ncaution in their selection or else import their own breeding queens.\r\nThere are many breeders of Italians from whom good stock can be\r\nobtained. Egyptian bees were tried some thirty years ago, but only\r\nto a very limited extent, and, as has been the case with Syrians and\r\nPalestines imported in 1880, and whose test was more prolonged and\r\ngeneral, they were condemned as inferior in temper and wintering\r\nqualities to the races of bees already here, it not being thought that\r\nthese points of inferiority were sufficiently balanced by their greater\r\nprolificness and their greater energy in honey collecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Worker cells of common honey bee (_Apis\r\nmellifera_); natural size. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe Tunisians, for similar reasons and also because they are great\r\ncollectors of propolis, never became popular, although a persistent\r\nattempt was made a few years since to create sale for them under the\r\nnew name of \"Punic bees,\" the undesirable qualities of the race having\r\npreviously been made known, under the original name, by the author,\r\nwho had tested them carefully for several years--a part of the time in\r\nTunis.\r\n\r\n_Cyprians._--Bees of the race native to the Island of Cyprus have\r\nproduced the largest yield of honey on record from a single colony\r\nin this country, 1,000 pounds in one season. Everyone who has fairly\r\ntested them admits their wonderful honey-gathering powers and their\r\npersevering courage in their labors even when the flowers are secreting\r\nhoney but scantily. They winter well and defend their hives against\r\nrobber bees and other enemies with greater energy than any other known\r\nrace. When storing honey Cyprians till the cells quite fall before\r\nsealing, and thus the capping rests against the honey, presenting a\r\nsemitransparent or \"watery\" appearance, which is undesirable. They\r\nare extremely sensitive, hence easily angered by rough or bungling\r\nmanipulators, and when once thoroughly aroused are very energetic\r\nin the use of their stings. These faults have caused a very general\r\nrejection of Cyprians, especially by those who produce comb honey.\r\nEven the producers of extracted honey do not seem to have learned how\r\nto manipulate Cyprians easily and without the use of much smoke, nor\r\nhow much more rapidly they could free their extracting combs from\r\nCyprian bees than from Italians. Nor have they seemed to count as of\r\nmuch importance the fact that Cyprians, unlike Italians and German or\r\ncommon bees, do not volunteer an attack when undisturbed; that they\r\nwill, in fact, let one pass and repass their hives quite unmolested\r\nand even under such circumstances as would call forth a vigorous and\r\nvery disagreeable protest from the other races just mentioned. It is\r\nto be regretted that there has been such a widespread rejection of a\r\nrace having such important and well-established excellent qualities.\r\nIt would be easier by selection in breeding to reduce the faults of\r\nthis race than to bring any other cultivated race to their equal in the\r\nother desirable points.\r\n\r\nCyprians are smaller-bodied and more slender than bees of European\r\nraces. The abdomen is also more pointed and shows, when the bees are\r\npurely bred, three light orange bands on the three segments nearest the\r\nthorax. The underside of the abdomen is even lighter orange colored\r\nnearly or quite to the tip. The postscutellum--the small lunule-like\r\nprominence on the thorax between the bases of the wings--is likewise\r\norange colored instead of dull, as in European races. The rest of\r\nthe thorax is covered with a russet-brown pubescence. Cyprians are\r\nthe yellowest of the original races, and their bright colors and\r\nsymmetrical forms render them attractive objects.\r\n\r\n_Italians._--Through the agency of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture bees of this race were introduced direct from Italy in\r\n1860. There had previously been repeated individual efforts to secure\r\nItalians bred in Germany, where the race had been introduced some years\r\nearlier, and a small number of queens had been landed here alive in\r\nthe autumn of 1859, but most of these died the following winter and\r\nthe few remaining alive seem not to have been multiplied as rapidly\r\nas those obtained in Italy by a purchasing agent of the Department of\r\nAgriculture and landed here early in 1860. Their good qualities were\r\nsoon appreciated, and they had become well established and widely\r\nspread long before the Cyprians, imported twenty years later. For\r\nthis reason, together with the fact that they cap their surplus combs\r\nwhiter than some other races and because less skill is required in\r\nsubduing and handling Italians, they have retained their popularity\r\nover bees which, though better honey gatherers, are more nervous under\r\nmanipulation. Their golden-yellow color has also proved so attractive\r\nto many that the good qualities of more somber-hued races--gentler,\r\nbetter winterers, and better comb builders--have not received due\r\nconsideration. Italians are, however, certainly preferable to the\r\ncommon brown or black bees, for they show greater energy in gathering\r\nhoney and in the defense of their hives against moth larvæ and robber\r\nbees, while at the same time they are gentler under manipulation than\r\nthe blacks, though they do not winter as well in severe climates.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bul. 1, new series, Div. of Entomology, U.

By selection in some instances, and in others by the\r\nintroduction of Cyprian blood, Italians and Italian hybrids have\r\nrecently been bred which show four or five yellow bands or which are\r\neven yellow to the tip of the abdomen. They are certainly pleasing to\r\nthe eye, and in case due heed has been given to the vigor and working\r\nqualities of the stock selected when establishing the strain, no\r\nvalid objection can be brought against them except the tendency they\r\nhave to revert to the original type of Italians. This is due to the\r\ncomparatively short time they have been bred, and with each season's\r\nselection will of course grow less.\r\n\r\n_Carniolans._--These, the gray bees from the elevated Alpine province\r\nof Carniola, Austria, are the gentlest of all races, and as, besides\r\ntheir other good qualities, they winter the best of any, it is not\r\nsurprising to see that they have steadily grown in favor. Their sealed\r\ncombs are exceedingly white, as they do not fill the cells so full\r\nthat the honey touches the capping, and they gather little propolis,\r\nqualities highly appreciated by the producer of comb honey. They\r\nare quite prolific, and if kept in small hives, such as have been\r\npopularized of late in the United States, are somewhat more inclined\r\nto swarm than the other races introduced here. This tendency becomes\r\nmore pronounced when they are taken into a country whose summers are\r\nhot, like ours, and their hives are not well shaded, as they have been\r\nbred for centuries, with only slight introduction of outside blood,\r\nin a climate where the summers are short and cool. Moreover, the\r\npractice in Carniola is to place the long, shallow hives used almost\r\nexclusively there, in beehouses and side by side, one above the other,\r\nwith intervening air spaces, so that at most only the front ends are\r\nexposed to the sun. This management long continued has doubtless tended\r\nto develop and fix more or less permanently in this race certain\r\ncharacteristics which should be taken into account in their management\r\nelsewhere. With these precautions they do well in all parts of the\r\nUnited States. (See Plate I, figs. 1, 4, and 5.)\r\n\r\nThe Carniolan worker is readily recognized by its large form, less\r\npointed abdomen, and general ashy gray coat, the abdominal segments\r\nespecially presenting a ringed appearance on account of silvery white\r\nhairs which cover the posterior half of each of these segments. By\r\ncrossing Carniolans with Italians or with Cyprians a yellow type with\r\nsilvery rings is produced, and by continued selection in breeding the\r\ngentle disposition of the Carniolans can be secured with the greater\r\nhoney-gathering powers of Cyprians should these be employed in forming\r\nthe new strain.\r\n\r\n_German, common black, or brown bees._--These bees are found commonly\r\nthroughout our country from ocean to ocean, both wild and domesticated.\r\nExactly when they were introduced from Europe is not known, but\r\nconsiderable evidence exists which shows that there were no hive bees\r\n(_Apis mellifera_) in this country for some time after the first\r\ncolonies were established; also, it was not until near the close of\r\nthe last century that they reached the Mississippi, and less than half\r\na century has passed since the first were successfully landed on the\r\nPacific Coast.\r\n\r\nMany bee keepers, having more attractively colored and frequently\r\nbetter bees, are inclined to consider this race as possessing hardly\r\nany redeeming qualities, or at least to underrate these because\r\naccompanied by undesirable traits. While it is true that they have\r\nsome serious faults, the latter are not so great as those of some\r\nother races. They have become thoroughly acclimated since their first\r\nimportation, over two centuries ago, and besides possessing good\r\nwintering and comb-building qualities, they will, when the flow of\r\nhoney is quite abundant, generally equal Italians in gathering. But\r\nthe disposition which bees of this race have of flying toward one\r\nwho approaches the apiary and stinging him, even though the hives\r\nhave not been molested, their way of running excitedly over the combs\r\nand dropping in bunches when they are handled, besides stinging the\r\nbacks of the operator's hands, unless the whole colony has first been\r\nthoroughly subdued and the bees induced to gorge themselves with honey,\r\nor are constantly deluged with smoke, are very annoying to the novice\r\nwho undertakes to perform necessary manipulations with them, and may\r\neven so discourage and daunt him as to cause the neglect of work of\r\ngreat importance to the welfare of the colony. The easy discouragement\r\nof bees of this race when a sudden check in the flow of honey occurs is\r\nalso a peculiarity which does not commend them. These things, tending\r\nto reduce profits, often dampen the beginner's enthusiasm before\r\nhe has acquired the knowledge and skill necessary to make the work\r\ngenuinely successful. He had therefore better choose either Italians\r\nor Carniolans, and use as breeders only queens that are known to have\r\nmated purely.\r\n\r\nThe common race shows considerable variation in its markings and\r\nqualities. The workers have a dull, rusty brown color, especially\r\nabout the thorax. Some strains are however much darker than others and\r\nin general the drones are darker than the workers. In size workers,\r\ndrones, and queens of this race are intermediate between the other\r\nEuropean races and those from the Orient. The same care and skill\r\napplied in the selection of breeding stock would result in as great\r\nimprovement in this as in any of the more attractive yellow races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Ovaries of queen and workers: A, abdomen of\r\nqueen--under side (magnified eight times); P, petiole; O, O, ovaries;\r\n_hs_, position filled by honey sac; _ds_, position through which\r\ndigestive system passes; _od_, oviduct; _co.d_, common oviduct; E,\r\negg-passing oviduct; _s_, spermatheca; _i_, intestine; _po_, poison\r\nbag; _p.g_, poison gland; _st_, sting; _p_, palpi.

Besides this there should be four,\r\nfive, or even more combs fairly stocked with developing brood, with a\r\ngood supply of honey about it. Drones may also be present, even several\r\nhundred in number, although it is better to limit their production to\r\nselected hives, which in the main it is not difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions the queen lays all of the eggs which are\r\ndeposited in the hive, being capable of depositing under favorable\r\nconditions as many as 4,000 in twenty-four hours. Ordinarily she mates\r\nbut once, flying from the hive to meet the drone--the male bee--high\r\nin the air, when five to nine days old generally, although this time\r\nvaries under different climatic conditions as well as with different\r\nraces. Seminal fluid sufficient to impregnate the greater number of\r\neggs she will deposit during the next two or three years (sometimes\r\neven four or five years) is stored at the time of mating in a sac--the\r\nspermatheca, opening into the oviduct or egg-passage (fig. 5, _s_).\r\nThe queen seems to be able to control this opening so as to fertilize\r\neggs or not as she wills at the time of depositing them. If fertilized\r\nthey develop into workers or queens according to the character of the\r\nfood given, the size and shape of the cell, etc.; if unfertilized,\r\ninto drones. The queen's life may extend over a period of four or five\r\nyears, but three years is quite as long as any queen ought to be kept,\r\nunless a particularly valuable one for breeding purposes and not easy\r\nto replace. Indeed, if full advantage be taken of her laying powers it\r\nwill rarely be found profitable to retain a queen longer than two years.\r\n\r\nUpon the workers, which are undeveloped females, devolves all the labor\r\nof gathering honey, pollen, propolis, and bringing water, secreting\r\nwax, building combs, stopping up crevices in the hive, nursing the\r\nbrood, and defending the hives. To enable them to do all this they are\r\nfurnished with highly specialized organs. These will be more fully\r\nreferred to in connection with the description of the products gathered\r\nand prepared by the workers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--A, Head of queen, magnified ten times, showing\r\nsmaller compound eyes at sides, and three ocelli on vertex of head;\r\n_n_, jaw notch. B, head of drone, magnified ten times, showing larger\r\ncompound eyes at sides, with three ocelli between; _n_, jaw notch.\r\n(From Cheshire.)]\r\n\r\nThe drones, aside from contributing somewhat to the general warmth\r\nof the hive necessary to the development of the brood, seem to have\r\nno other office but that connected with reproduction. In the wild\r\nstate colonies of bees are widely separated, being located wherever\r\nthe swarms chance to have found hollow trees or rock cavities, hence\r\nthe production of many drones has been provided for, so young queens\r\nflying out to mate will not run too many risks from bird and insect\r\nenemies, storms, etc. Mating in the hive would result in too continuous\r\nin-and-in breeding, producing loss of vigor. As we find it arranged,\r\nthe most vigorous are the most likely to reproduce their species.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the queen's mating there are in the hive neither eggs\r\nnor young larvæ from which to rear another queen; thus, should she be\r\nlost, no more fertilized eggs would be deposited, and the old workers\r\ngradually dying off without being replaced by young ones, the colony\r\nwould become extinct in the course of a few months at most, or meet a\r\nspeedier fate through intruders, such as wax-moth larvæ, robber bees,\r\nwasps, etc., which its weakness would prevent its repelling longer; or\r\ncold is very likely to finish such a decimated colony, especially as\r\nthe bees, because queenless, are uneasy and do not cluster compactly.\r\n\r\nThe loss of queens while flying out to mate is evidently one of the\r\nprovisions in nature to prevent bees from too great multiplication, for\r\nwere there no such checks they would soon become a pest in the land. On\r\nthe other hand, the risk to the queen is not uselessly increased, for\r\nshe mates but once during her life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Modifications of the legs of different bees:\r\nA, _Apis_: _a_, wax pincer and outer view of hind leg; _b_, inner\r\naspect of wax pincer and leg; _c_, compound hairs holding grains of\r\npollen; _d_, anterior leg, showing antenna cleaner; _e_, spur on tibia\r\nof middle leg.

(From Insect Life.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n          BEE PRODUCTS AND ORGANS USED IN THEIR PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nPollen and honey form the food of honey bees and their developing\r\nbrood. Both of these are plant products which are only modified\r\nsomewhat by the manipulation to which they are subjected by the bees\r\nand are then stored in waxen cells if not wanted for immediate use.\r\nPollen, the fertilizing dust of flowers, is carried home by the bees in\r\nsmall pellets held in basket-like depressions on each of the hind legs.\r\nThe hairs covering the whole surface of the bee's body are more or less\r\nserviceable in enabling the bee to collect pollen, but those on the\r\nunder side of the abdomen are most likely to get well dusted, and the\r\nrows of hairs, nine in number, known as pollen brushes, located on the\r\ninner surface of the first tarsal joint (fig. 7, _b_), are then brought\r\ninto use to brush out this pollen. When these brushes are filled with\r\npollen the hind legs are crossed during flight and the pollen combed\r\nout by the spine-like hairs that fringe the posterior margin of the\r\ntibial joint--that above a in fig. 7. The outer surface of this joint\r\nis depressed, and this, with the rows of curved hairs on the anterior\r\nmargin and the straighter ones just referred to forms a basket like\r\ncavity known as the corbiculum or pollen basket, represented by\r\nthe longest joints of the legs, A, B, and C, fig. 7. Into this the\r\npollen falls, and with the middle pair of legs is tamped down for\r\ntransportation to the hive. Having arrived there, the bee thrusts its\r\nhind legs into a cell located as near to the brood nest as may be, and\r\nloosening the pellets lets them fall into the bottom of the cell. The\r\ntibial spur (fig. 7, _e_) on each middle leg is, as Professor Cheshire\r\nhas pointed out, probably of use in prying the pellets out. The latter\r\nare simply dropped into cells and left for some other bee to pack down\r\nby kneading or pressing with its mandibles. Various colors--yellow,\r\nbrown, red, slate, etc., according to the kinds of flowers from which\r\ngathered--frequently show in layers in the same cell. Often when partly\r\nfilled with pollen the cell is then filled up with honey and sealed\r\nmore or less hermetically with wax. The bees store the pollen, for\r\nconvenience in feeding, above and at the sides of the brood and as\r\nnear to it as possible, the comb on each side of the brood nest being\r\ngenerally well stored with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Head and tongue of Apis mellifera worker\r\n(magnified twelve times), _a_, Antenna, or feeler; _m_, mandibula, or\r\nouter jaw; _g_, gum flap, or epipharynx; _mxp_, maxillary palpus; _pg_,\r\nparaglossa; _mx_, maxilla, or inner jaw; _lp_, labial palpus, _l_,\r\nligula, or tongue; _b_, bouton, or spoon of the same.

Bees suck\r\nor lap it up from such flowers as they can reach with their flexible,\r\nsucking tongue, 0.25 to 0.28 inch long. (Fig. 8, _l_.) This nectar is\r\ntaken into the honey sac (Plate II, _h.s._) located in the abdomen, for\r\ntransportation to the hive. It is possible that part of the water is\r\neliminated by the gatherers before they reach the hive. A Russian bee\r\nkeeper, M. Nassanoff, while dissecting a worker, discovered between\r\nthe fifth and sixth abdominal segments a small canal, to which he\r\nattributed an excretory function, and Zoubareff, having noticed bees\r\nejecting a watery substance while returning from the fields, suggested\r\nthat this gland probably served to separate a portion of the water from\r\nthe nectar, the liquid deposited in the cells appearing to contain less\r\nof it than that just secreted by the flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bul. 1, new series, Div. of Entomology, U.

Besides being thin, the nectar has at first\r\na raw, rank taste, generally the flavor and odor peculiar to the plant\r\nfrom which gathered, and these are frequently far from agreeable. To\r\nmake from this raw product the healthful and delicious table luxury\r\nwhich honey constitutes--\"fit food for the gods\"--is another of the\r\nfunctions peculiar to the worker bee. The first step is the stationing\r\nof workers in lines near the hive entrances. These, by incessant\r\nbuzzing of their wings, drive currents of air into and out of the hive\r\nand over the comb surfaces. If the hand be held before the entrance\r\nat such a time a strong current of warm air may be felt coming out.\r\nThe loud buzzing heard at night during the summer time is due to the\r\nwings of workers engaged chiefly in ripening nectar. Instead of being\r\nat rest, as many suppose, the busy workers are caring for the last\r\nlot of gathered nectar and making room for further accessions. This\r\nmay go on far into the night, or even all night, to a greater or less\r\nextent, the loudness and activity being proportionate to the amount and\r\nthinness of the liquid. Frequently the ripening honey is removed from\r\none set of cells and placed in others. This may be to gain the use of\r\ncertain combs for the queen, or possibly it is merely incidental to\r\nthe manipulation the bees wish to give it. When, finally, the process\r\nhas been completed, it is found that the water content has usually\r\nbeen reduced to 10 or 12 per cent, and that the disagreeable odors\r\nand flavors, probably due to volatile oils, have also been driven off\r\nin a great measure, if not wholly, by the heat of the hive, largely\r\ngenerated by the bees. During the manipulation an antiseptic--formic\r\nacid--secreted by glands in the head of the bee, and it is also\r\npossible other glandular secretions, have been added. The finished\r\nproduct is stored in waxen cells above and around the brood nest and\r\nthe main cluster of bees, as far from the entrance as it can be and\r\nstill be near to the brood and bees. The work of sealing with waxen\r\ncaps then goes forward rapidly, the covering being more or less porous.\r\n\r\nEach kind of honey has its distinctive flavor and aroma, derived, as\r\nalready indicated, mainly from the particular blossoms by which it\r\nwas secreted, but modified and softened by the manipulation given it\r\nin the hives. When the secretion is abundant in a flower having a\r\nshort or open corolla, hence one from which the bees find it easy to\r\nobtain the honey, they will confine their visits to that kind if the\r\nlatter is present in sufficient numbers. Thus it is that linden, white\r\nclover, buckwheat, white sage, mesquite, sourwood, aster, tulip tree,\r\nmangrove, orange, and other kinds of honey may be harvested separately,\r\nand each be readily recognizable by its color, flavor, consistency,\r\nand aroma. When, however, no great honey yielder is present in large\r\nquantity and the source is miscellaneous, all manner of combinations\r\nof qualities may exist, introducing great and often agreeable variety.\r\nThus the medicinal qualities and the food value of different kinds of\r\nhoney differ as greatly as do their prices on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nThis substance, commonly known as \"bee glue,\" is obtained by the bees\r\nfrom the buds and crevices of trees, and is carried to the hives in\r\nthe corbicula or basket-like cavities on the outside of the tibial\r\njoints of the workers' hind legs, the same as they carry pollen. The\r\nworkers with their mandibles scrape together and bite off the particles\r\nof propolis, and with the front and middle legs pass them back to the\r\nbaskets, where the middle legs and feet are used to tamp them down. The\r\npellets can be readily distinguished from those of pollen, the latter\r\nbeing dull and granular in appearance, while the freshly gathered\r\npropolis is compact and shiny. This resinous material, which becomes\r\nhard soon after it is gathered, is at first quite sticky, and the bee\r\nbringing it requires aid in unloading. Another worker takes hold of\r\nthe mass with its jaws, and by united exertion they get it out of the\r\npocket, though often by piecemeal and in long threads. It is not stored\r\nin cells, but is used at once to stop up crevices in the hives and to\r\nvarnish the whole interior surface, as well as to glue movable portions\r\nfast, also in strengthening the combs at their attachments, and if the\r\nlatter are designed exclusively for honey, and especially if not filled\r\nat once, the edges of their completed cells receive a thin coating of\r\npropolis, which adds considerably to their strength. The bees often\r\nmake the flight hole smaller by filling a part of it with masses of\r\npropolis, sometimes mixed with old wax. Carniolans gather the least\r\nand Tunisians the most propolis of any of the different races. On this\r\naccount the former are better suited than the latter to the production\r\nof fancy white comb honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BEE POISON AND THE STING.\r\n\r\nThe worker and the queen are supplied with another organ which is of\r\ngreat importance to them, namely, the sting; for without this the\r\nhard-earned stores of the hive would soon be a prey to all manner of\r\nmarauders, and the queen would be deprived of an organ of occasional\r\nuse to her in dispatching rivals, and of daily use to her during the\r\nworking season in the deposition of eggs. The darts work independently\r\nand alternately, and are connected at the base with the poison sac,\r\nwithout whose powerful contents such a tiny weapon would be wholly\r\nineffective. Poison glands pour an acid secretion--largely formic\r\nacid--into this sac, whence it is conveyed to the tip of the sting\r\nalong the groove or canal formed by the junction of the sheath and the\r\ndarts. The sting being but an ovipositor modified also another purpose\r\nin addition to oviposition, in the perfect female (the queen) its main\r\nuse is in placing the eggs in their proper position in the bottoms of\r\nthe cells.\r\n\r\nFormic acid is known to have considerable antiseptic properties.\r\nChemical tests show its presence in well-ripened honey, but not in\r\nfreshly gathered nectar. The natural conclusion is that it has been\r\nadded by the bees to assist in the preservation of the honey. In what\r\nmanner it is supplied has frequently been questioned. Tests applied to\r\nthe blood of the bee show its presence there, and the secretions of the\r\nhead glands show still larger quantities. It is therefore reasonable\r\nto suppose that these glands, as well as the poison glands themselves\r\nsecrete formic acid, and that the honey receives its portion from the\r\nformer, the head glands, upon being disgorged from the honey-sac or\r\nduring the manipulation to which it is subjected in the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                WATER.\r\n\r\nDuring cold or cool weather much condensation of moisture takes place\r\nin wooden hives as these are usually arranged. The water, collecting in\r\ndrops on the interior walls of the hive and on the cold, sealed honey,\r\noften trickles down over the cluster of bees, to their great injury. It\r\nhas been claimed that when brood rearing begins this condensed moisture\r\nwill be utilized in the preparation of brood food. Very possibly it\r\nmay, yet its use is probably detrimental, since it is charged with\r\nwaste products of the hive--those of respiration, etc. In its absence\r\nthe water contained in the honey, if the latter has not granulated,\r\nseems to be sufficient. Later, however, when no condensation takes\r\nplace in the hive and the greater number of developing larvæ require\r\nconsiderable supplies of water in their food, special trips are made to\r\nbrooks and pools for it, and dew is often gathered from leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SILK.\r\n\r\nThe larval bee produces a small amount of silk from glands in its\r\nhead. The pupal cell is partially lined with this. Later, as the bee\r\ndevelops, there being no further use for the glands, they become\r\natrophied.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 WAX.\r\n\r\nThe light colored pellets which are carried into the hive on the hind\r\nlegs of the workers, and which have been described as pollen, are often\r\nmistaken for wax. The fact is, wax is not gathered in the form in which\r\nwe see it, except in rare instances, when, bits of comb having been\r\nleft about, small quantities will be loaded up and taken in as pellets\r\non the legs. Ordinarily it comes into the hive in the shape of honey\r\nand is transformed by the workers within their own bodies into wax.\r\nThis production is wholly confined to the workers, for although the\r\nqueen has wax plates 011 the underside of the abdomen and wax glands\r\nbeneath them, yet both are less developed than in the workers and\r\nare never used. The wax plates of the worker overlying the secreting\r\nglands are well shown in fig. 9, those of the queen and of the related\r\ngenera, _Bombus_ and _Melipona_, being shown for comparison. During wax\r\nsecretion, that is, when combs are being built or honey cells sealed\r\nover, a high temperature is maintained in the hive, and many workers\r\nmay be seen to have small scales of wax protruding from between the\r\nsegments of the abdomen on the underside. The molds or plates, eight\r\nin number, in which the scales appear are concealed by the overlapping\r\nof the abdominal segments, but when exposed to view (fig. 9, _a_) are\r\nseen to be five-sided depressions lined with a transparent membrane.\r\nThe wax glands themselves are beneath this membrane, and through it the\r\nwax comes in a liquid form. As the scales harden they are pushed out by\r\nthe addition of wax beneath. The bees pluck them out with neat pincers\r\n(fig. 7, _a_ and _b_) formed by the articulation of the hind tibiæ\r\nwith the adjacent tarsal joints, pass them forward to the mandibles,\r\nand mold them into the shape of hexagonal cells, meanwhile warming and\r\nmoistening them with the secretions of the head glands to render the\r\nwax more pliable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Wax disks of social bees: _a_, Apis mellifera\r\nworker; _b_. A. mellifera queen; _c_, Melipona worker; _d_, Bombus\r\nworker--all enlarged. (From Insect Life.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                COMBS.\r\n\r\nWax is fashioned by the workers into cells of various sizes and shapes,\r\naccording to the use to be made of them. The most regular in shape and\r\nsize are the cells designed for brood (fig. 4). These combs in which\r\nworkers are bred show nearly 29 cells on a square inch of surface, the\r\ncombs being seven-eighths inch thick and the cells generally quite\r\nregular hexagons in outline. Drone cells are larger, there being but\r\n18 of them to the square inch of surface, and the comb is 1¼ inches\r\nthick. The cells of combs designed only for honey are frequently more\r\nirregular in shape, generally curve upward somewhat, and are often\r\ndeepened as the honey is stored in them, so that these combs sometimes\r\nreach a thickness of 2 or 3 inches.\r\n\r\nThe cells in which queens are bred bear in size and shape some\r\nresemblance to a ground or pea nut. They are often irregular in form,\r\nbeing sometimes curved, or short and thick, according to the space\r\nbelow their point of attachment, which is most frequently the lower\r\nedge or the side edge of a comb, or sometimes a mere projection or\r\nangularity in the general surface of a comb. Queen cells open downward\r\ninstead of being built horizontally like drone and worker cells (figs.\r\n62 and 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Comb building--side of hive removed.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nInto the material used in constructing brood combs bees often\r\nincorporate bits of wax and fiber-like gnawings of cocoons from\r\nold combs in which brood has been reared, and if given cappings or\r\ntrimmings of combs they will work them all over and utilize most of\r\nthe material. Also when the bees have abundant supplies of pollen much\r\nof this is incorporated into the material of brood combs, thus saving\r\nthe costlier substance--wax. Such combs show at once by their brownish\r\nor straw color, even when first constructed, that they are not made of\r\nwax alone. It will readily be seen from the above that the quantity\r\nof honey consumed by the bees in producing a pound of comb must vary\r\ngreatly, for if the comb is designed for surplus honey it will be made\r\nof newly secreted wax, while if for brood other material will, as\r\njust stated, replace a portion of the wax. The amount of honey coming\r\nin varies from day to day, and it is difficult to estimate how much\r\nis consumed in feeding and keeping warm the brood: moreover, a high\r\ntemperature is required in the hive to facilitate the secretion and\r\nworking of wax, necessitating, of course, extra food consumption when\r\nthe outside temperature is low. Accordingly estimates as to the amount\r\nof honey required to produce 1 pound of comb range from 5 pounds to 25\r\npounds. More accurate experiments are needed in this direction before\r\nanything positive can be stated. Until then 18 to 20 pounds might be\r\nlooked upon as nearest the correct figure for white surplus combs, and\r\nhalf as much for dull straw-colored or brownish combs built for brood\r\nrearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DEVELOPMENT OF BROOD.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the winter cluster in a hive of bees occupies the more\r\ncentral combs, four or five in number. Near the middle of this\r\ncluster the queen deposits the first eggs of the season (which are\r\nfertilized eggs) in the small-sized or worker cells. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances, that is, in a strong colony amply protected against\r\ninclement weather, this deposition usually occurs in January, though\r\nin a very mild climate some brood is generally present during every\r\nmonth of the year, and the cessation of egg-laying is very short. The\r\neggs hatch on the third day after deposition into minute white larvæ,\r\nto which the workers supply food in abundance. The composition of this\r\nfood has been the subject of much attention and more theorizing. It may\r\nbe considered as pretty certain that during the first three days of the\r\nlife of the larva its food is a secretion from glands located in the\r\nheads of the adult workers--a sort of bee milk, to which, after the\r\nthird day, honey is added in the case of the worker larvæ, and honey\r\nand pollen in the case of drone larva?. As this weaning proceeds both\r\nworker and drone larvæ receive pollen, and in constantly increasing\r\nproportions, in place of the secretion. But this rich albuminous\r\nsubstance is continued to the queen larvæ throughout their whole period\r\nof feeding; moreover, the quantity of this food supplied to each queen\r\nlarva is apparently super-abundant, for after it ceases to feed quite a\r\nmass of the food somewhat dried out will be found in the bottom of the\r\ncell from which a well-developed queen has issued. After assuming the\r\npupa form the young queen is attached to this food by means of the tip\r\nof the abdomen, and it very likely continues for some time to receive\r\nnourishment from the mass.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows approximately the time occupied in the\r\ndevelopment of worker, drone, and queen:\r\n\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+---------+-----------------+\r\n  |          |         |         |         | From deposition |\r\n  |          |   Egg.  | Larva.  |  Pupa.  | of egg to imago.|\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+---------+-----------------+\r\n  |          | _Days._ | _Days._ | _Days._ |     _Days._     |\r\n  |  Queen   |     3   |     5½  |     7   |        15½      |\r\n  |  Worker  |     3   |     5   |    13   |        21       |\r\n  |  Drone   |     3   |     6   |    15   |        24       |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+---------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nThe original circles of brood are gradually increased by the deposition\r\nof eggs in the cells next outside those already occupied, and circles\r\nare soon begun in the adjoining combs. In this way the space occupied\r\nby the developing bees is gradually increased, while preserving the\r\ngeneral spherical shape of the brood nest thus formed, which, however,\r\nthe shape of the hive often modifies somewhat. As already mentioned,\r\neach circle of brood has rows of pollen cells about it, chiefly above\r\nand at the sides, and the combs on either side contiguous to the brood\r\nare usually well packed with pollen. Outside of the pollen most of\r\nthe honey on hand is stored. Thus (fig. 11) a cross section made in\r\nany direction through the middle of a hive in normal condition at the\r\nopening of the active season should show this relative arrangement\r\nof brood, pollen, and honey, which economizes most the heat of the\r\nhive and the labors of the nurse bees, favoring in this way the rapid\r\nincrease of the population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Cross section of brood apartment: _s, s_,\r\nsides of hive; _t, t_, top-bars of frames; _h, p, l, sb_, combs\r\ncontaining (_h_) honey, (_p_) pollen, (_l_) larvæ and eggs, and (_sb_)\r\nsealed brood. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE WORKER.\r\n\r\nThe worker larvæ are fed five days, and then the cell is given by the\r\nadult bees a covering which is quite porous by reason of numerous\r\npollen grains incorporated into its mass, this openness of texture\r\nbeing necessary to give the developing bee air to breathe. The larva\r\nstrength ens this capping by a loose webwork of silk within, extending\r\ndown the side but slightly and attached at its edges to the last skin\r\ncast by the molting larva. This skin, extremely delicate and pressed\r\nclosely against the inside of the cell, forms the lining of its sides\r\nand bottom. In about twelve days after sealing, that is, twenty-one\r\ndays from the time the egg was deposited, the imago, or perfect bee,\r\nbites its way through the brown covering.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a couple of days it takes up the work of a nurse, and\r\nin a week to ten days may appear at the entrance on pleasant days,\r\ntaking, however, but short flights for exercise, as ordinary field work\r\nis not undertaken until it has passed about two weeks in the care of\r\nbrood. The worker then takes up also wax secretion, if honey is to be\r\ncapped over or combs built, although old bees can and do to a certain\r\nextent engage in wax production.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE DRONE.\r\n\r\nEggs left unfertilized produce drones and require twenty-four days\r\nfrom the time they are deposited until the perfect insect appears.\r\nThey are normally deposited in the larger-sized horizontal cells, and\r\nwhen the latter are sealed, the capping is more convex as well as\r\nlighter-colored than that of worker brood, which is brown and nearly\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nThe fact that drones develop from unfertilized eggs is to be noted\r\nas having an important practical bearing in connection with the\r\nintroduction of new strains of a given race or of new races of bees\r\ninto an apiary. From a single choice home-bred or imported mother,\r\nyoung queens of undoubted purity of blood may be reared for all of the\r\ncolonies of the apiary, and since the mating of these young queens\r\ndoes not affect their drone progeny, thereafter only drones of the\r\ndesired strain or race and pure in blood will be produced, rendering,\r\ntherefore, the pure mating of future rearings fairly certain if other\r\nbees are not numerous within a mile or two. Eventually also all of\r\nthe colonies will be changed to the new race and without admixture of\r\nimpure blood, provided always that the young queens be reared from\r\nmothers of pure blood mated to drones of equal purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                    QUIETING AND MANIPULATING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demeanor of bees toward an individual depends largely upon his\r\nbearing and treatment of them. Langstroth, in his excellent treatise,\r\nLangstroth on the Honey Bee (p. 193, revised edition), says:\r\n\r\n  Let all your motions about your hives be gentle and slow; never crush\r\n  or injure the bees; acquaint yourself fully with the principles of\r\n  management, and you will find you have little more reason to dread\r\n  the sting of a bee than the horns of a favorite cow or the heels of\r\n  your faithful horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Use of veil and bee smoker. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nMost bee manipulators, however, grow somewhat indifferent to stings,\r\nsince in time they become so inoculated with the poison of the bee that\r\nthe pain of the sting is less severe and the swelling slight. _But to\r\navoid the stings is, with some of the races more recently introduced\r\ninto this country, simply a question of care in manipulation and a free\r\nuse of smoke._ It is not meant that the bees should be stupefied with\r\nsmoke, but merely alarmed and subjugated, and whenever they show any\r\ndisposition to act on the offensive recourse is to be had to smoke. It\r\nis not necessary that the smoke should be from a particular source,\r\nbut that from certain substances, as tobacco, subjugates them more\r\nquickly, while burning puffball stupefies them for the time. There are\r\nsome objections to these substances which do not apply to wood, either\r\npartially decayed or sound, and as the latter when in a good smoker\r\nholds fire best and is very effective, it is advisable to keep a good\r\nsupply at hand. Seasoned hickory or hard maple are best, though beech,\r\nsoft maple, etc., are good. The most improved bellows smokers, when\r\nsupplied with such fuel sawed 5 or C inches long and split into bits a\r\nhalf inch or less in size, will burn all day and be ready at any time\r\nto give a good volume of blue smoke, by which bees of most of the races\r\nnow cultivated in this country are subdued at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Manipulation--removing comb from hive.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nWith Italian or black bees a puff or two of smoke should be given at\r\nthe hive entrance and the cover and honey board, or quilt, removed\r\nslowly and carefully, smoke being driven in as soon as the least\r\nopening is made and the volume increased enough to keep down all bees\r\nas fast as the covering is removed. The smoker may then be placed on\r\nthe windward side of the hive to allow the fumes to pass over the top\r\nand toward the operator. The frames may then be gently pried loose and\r\nlifted out carefully, without crushing a bee if it can be avoided.\r\nCrushing bees fills the air with the odor of poison, which irritates\r\nthe bees. So also when one bee is provoked to sting others follow\r\nbecause of the odor of poison.\r\n\r\nToo much smoke will often render certain manipulations difficult; for\r\nexample, when queens are to be sought out, or nuclei or artificial\r\nswarms made, volumes of smoke blown in between the combs will drive\r\nthe bees from them so that they will cluster in clumps on the bottoms\r\nof the frames or in the corners of the hives. A little observation and\r\njudgment will enable one to know when the bees need smoke and how much\r\nof it to prevent any outbreak on their part, which it is always best to\r\nforestall rather than be obliged to quell after it is fully under way.\r\n\r\nThe frame hive as now made--with metal rabbets and arrangements\r\nfor surplus honey, and quilts instead of honey boards--reduces\r\npropolization to a minimum and renders the danger of irritating the\r\nbees by jarring when manipulating much less. As a prerequisite to rapid\r\nand safe manipulation _perfectly straight combs are necessary_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Manipulation--tilting to bring reverse side of\r\ncomb in view. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Manipulation--reverse side of comb brought to\r\nview. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Manipulation--examining verse side of comb.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nWith the common or black bees it is never safe to do without the veil\r\nas a protection to the face, and with these bees it will also be very\r\ndifficult to avoid stings on the hands unless considerable smoke has\r\nbeen driven into the entrance beforehand and time has been given the\r\nbees to get well filled with honey before the hive is opened; even\r\nthen frequent recourse to smoke will generally be necessary. Blacks\r\nare by far the most troublesome of all races about flying from their\r\nhive entrances to sting in an unprovoked manner. Next to these are\r\nthe crosses containing the blood of the blacks. Italians have much\r\nless of this disposition, and Carniolans and Cyprians rarely, then\r\nlatter almost never, fly from their hive entrances to attack unless\r\ntheir hives have been disturbed. _Pure_ Cyprians can generally be\r\nhandled without the use of the bee veil by skillful bee manipulators\r\nwho understand the qualities of the race. Much of the work among pure\r\nItalians can be done without a veil after one has gained experience\r\nin manipulation. During four years' residence in Carniola the writer,\r\nmanipulating annually several hundred colonies of bees, never had\r\noccasion to employ a bee veil. If no bees but gray Carniolans of pure\r\nblood are in the apiary and some smoke is used a veil will never be\r\nnecessary. They maybe handled in all kinds of weather, early and late,\r\neven during the night, yet with but a small part of the risk which\r\nattends the manipulation of other races. Nor will it be necessary to\r\ndelude them with smoke from time to time, as one is obliged to do with\r\nblacks. To dispense entirely with the bee veil is a more important\r\nconsideration, especially to the professional bee-master, than is at\r\nfirst apparent to the inexperienced. Its use injures the eyesight\r\nseriously, especially where one is obliged to strain his eyes for hours\r\nto see eggs, larvæ, etc., in the cells, to hunt out queens and queen\r\ncells, and adjust frames. Besides this, the hindrance to rapid work\r\nwhich the veil causes, as well as the great discomfort in wearing it\r\nfor hours during hot weather, are considerations worth weighing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Quinby closed-end frames. (From A B C of Bee\r\nCulture.)]\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: To secure easy, rapid, and safe manipulation\r\naccurately made hives, with the frames, if hanging, arranged to rest on\r\nfolded metal rabbets, and the combs perfectly straight, are essential.\r\nIt is equally important also that some one of the gentler races be\r\nkept Furthermore, a good bee smoker fed with dry fuel is necessary,\r\nwhile the bee escape to clear supers without manipulation of combs is a\r\ngreat help. Quilts, queen excluders, and bee escapes reduce the amount\r\nof manipulation required, and at the same time facilitate what is\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIn general, the best time to manipulate hives is when most of the bees\r\nare busy in the fields. The young bees left at home are most easily\r\ncontrolled and the old ones returning are generally laden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n           =ESTABLISHING AN APIARY: TIME--SELECTING HIVES OF\r\n                BEES--MOVING BEES--SELECTION OF SITE.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring is the best season to establish an apiary, especially for a\r\nperson unacquainted with the practical care of bees. Colonies in good\r\ncondition procured then are more easily kept in order by the novice\r\nthan if purchased in the fall. Mistakes in management may possibly be\r\nremedied before the season closes, and by the time it is necessary to\r\nprepare for the winter the learner will have gained a certain amount of\r\npractical knowledge of the nature and requirements of the bees. If the\r\nstart be made late in the season mistakes, if they occur, may result\r\nfatally before the proper remedy can be applied.\r\n\r\nThe beginner had better obtain his start by purchasing one or two\r\ncolonies of pure Italian or Carniolan bees in accurately made frame\r\nhives and in first-class condition. These he should get from some\r\nbee-master of repute near his own place, if possible, in order to\r\navoid expressage and possible damage through long confinement or\r\nnumerous transfers. The cost per colony may be $6 to $8; yet bees\r\nat this price will generally be found much cheaper in the end, for,\r\nthough common bees in box hives may frequently be obtained for half\r\nor even less than half as much, the cost, when finally transferred\r\ninto frame hives, fitted up with straight combs, and the common queens\r\nreplaced by Italians or Carniolans, will not be less. The possession\r\nof a colony already in prime working order gives the novice a standard\r\nwith which to compare all others and often enables him to avoid costly\r\nexperiments. Another plan, also commendable, is to agree with some\r\nneighboring bee keeper to deliver as many first swarms on the day they\r\nissue as are wanted. These will give the right start if placed as soon\r\nas received in hives with foundation starters and the frames properly\r\nspaced--1⅜ inches from center to center, it being understood that the\r\nswarms are early and prime ones, with vigorous queens. Only those\r\nissuing from colonies that have swarmed the year before or from such as\r\nwere themselves second swarms of the previous year should be accepted.\r\nSwarms from these will have queens not over one year old. It is better\r\nto have queens of the current year's raising, but these can only be\r\nobtained by taking the second or third swarms from a given hive, which\r\ncome later and are smaller, or by substituting young queens for those\r\nwhich come with the swarms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SELECTION OF STOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe relative Strength of different stocks may be determined by watching\r\nthe flight of the bees. The playing of the young bees in front of the\r\nhive is apt to deceive one. This lasts but twenty minutes or so, but\r\na weak stock compared then with a strong one whose young bees are not\r\nflying might be regarded as very populous. The young bees sporting in\r\nfront of the hive may be known by their light, fuzzy appearance, and\r\nby the fact that as they take wing to leave the hive they turn their\r\nheads toward the entrance and sail about it in semicircles, frequently\r\nalighting on the flight board and taking wing again. They are thus\r\nmarking the location of the hive so as to be able to return to it, for\r\nan attempt to enter another hive might result fatally to them. They\r\nfinally fly away in constantly widening circles. Field workers used to\r\nthe location fly in a direct line away from the hive. When the young\r\nbees return they do not alight at once as do the field workers laden\r\nwith honey, but generally hover about the entrance until certain they\r\nhave reached the right hive. Having noted by their flight which stocks\r\nseem to have the most bees, a closer examination can be made by blowing\r\na little smoke of any sort into the entrances and tipping the hives\r\nback, if they stand on loose bottom boards. When not so constructed the\r\nexamination must, of course, be made by removing the top covering, or\r\nif the combs are built in frames, some of these.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the strength of the colony, the number of combs\r\ncontaining brood, straightness, kind and age of combs, amount of\r\nhoney on hand, the cleanliness and healthfulness of the colony are\r\npoints upon which full information is desirable. In April a good\r\ncolony located in a central latitude ought to have brood in five or\r\nsix combs; yet as ordinarily wintered it will be difficult to find\r\ncolonies having at this time more than three or four combs containing\r\nbrood. The combs should be straight, so that if in an old-fashioned\r\nbox hive they can be cut out and fitted without great waste into\r\nframes, and if the hive is a frame one it is absolutely necessary to\r\nhave combs straight and built wholly within the frames in order that\r\nthe latter may be readily removed and returned to the hive. The less\r\ndrone comb the better. There will always be enough, an area half the\r\nsize of a man's hand being quite sufficient for each hive. The larger\r\nsize of the drone cells and greater thickness of the combs (1¼ inches)\r\nwill make it readily recognizable. If over one-eighth of the surface\r\nis drone comb the colony should be rejected. If the combs are so old\r\nas to be nearly black and to show cell walls much thickened they are\r\nvery objectionable. There should be several pounds of sealed honey\r\nin each hive in early spring. Other things being equal, those stocks\r\nwhich come through the winter with 20 pounds or so of sealed honey in\r\nthe combs will develop much faster than those having just enough to\r\nlast them until they gather fresh honey rapidly enough to supply their\r\ndaily needs. The presence of an abundance gives the bees courage.\r\nThey do not fear to draw upon their stores to supply the young that\r\nare fast developing. The combs filled with honey part with their heat\r\nonly slowly when the outside temperature falls, and there is thus less\r\ndanger of a check in the development of the brood through too low\r\ntemperature in the hive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Box hive prepared for transportation.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nIf the surfaces of the combs, the frames, or the inner walls of the\r\nhive are spotted with a brown, crumbly looking substance it is an\r\nevidence that the bees have bad diarrhea during the winter or spring,\r\nand if they have been badly affected not only will the combs and the\r\nwhole interior of the hive be soiled, the former perhaps so as to be\r\nrendered almost worthless, but the bees will lack vitality, and will\r\nsoon dwindle in numbers, not being able to survive the first arduous\r\nlabors of the opening of the season. It is not always easy to determine\r\nwhether a stock in a box hive is affected with foul brood or not, for\r\nthe odor of decaying brood is not of itself sufficient to warrant such\r\na conclusion, although it is well to reject any hive having any putrid\r\nodor about it. The natural odor of the hive, produced as it is largely\r\nby honey, wax, pollen, and propolis, is not unpleasant to most people,\r\nso that the presence of any disagreeable odor should arouse suspicion.\r\nIf larvæ that have turned black are seen in the cells, and the capping\r\nof the sealed brood is sunken and in some instances perforated,\r\nshowing brown and ropy contents in the bottoms of the cells, and the\r\nputrid odor is present, the existence of foul brood (_Bacillus alvei_\r\nCheshire) is pretty certain. This is a scourge much to be dreaded. Not\r\nonly should no hives or colonies be purchased from the same apiary, but\r\nnone in the vicinity of an apiary so affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Frame hive prepared for transportation.\r\n(Orig.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOVING BEES.\r\n\r\nIn moving bees the box hives should be turned bottom upward, the bees\r\ndriven back by blowing a little smoke on them, and a few loose rolls\r\nof rags laid across the lower edges of the combs in such a manner that\r\na piece of sheeting, sacking, or preferably cheese cloth or other open\r\nmaterial may be tied over the whole lower end and drawn tightly, so\r\nas to press the rolls against the combs and hold them in place. It is\r\neven well to tack strips of lath outside of the covering, so placed\r\nthat they will cross the rolls of rags and press the latter more firmly\r\nagainst the lower edges of the combs. Strips may also be tacked around\r\nthe lower edges of the hive to hold the cloth in place, or it maybe\r\nfastened by winding with strong cord. The bees should be thus prepared\r\nas late in the day as possible, care being taken that none escape, and\r\nat dusk stood bottom upward in a spring conveyance or on straw or hay\r\nseveral inches deep in the box of a wagon, with straw packed between\r\nand around the hives. It is advisable to drive slowly, avoiding ruts as\r\nmuch as possible. By turning the hives bottom upward the weight of the\r\ncombs rests on their points of attachment, and since in such hives the\r\ncombs are not always attached well down the sides danger of breakage\r\nis lessened, especially when the rolls of cloth are pressed against\r\nthe edges of the combs. If the bees are in frame hives, the frames of\r\nwhich have not been disturbed recently, it is likely that, with care in\r\ndriving, the combs will not get displaced. If necessary to use a sheet\r\nor cloth to give ventilation, it should be tied over the top and the\r\nhive placed in the wagon in the same position it occupied on the stand,\r\nlest the combs, not being attached all the way down, should fall to one\r\nside or the other. Except during quite warm weather and for long trips\r\nit may not be necessary to adopt all the precautions here indicated,\r\nalthough in case bees are to be transported on long journeys by rail or\r\nwater far more careful preparation is even necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--An apiary in Florida. (Reproduced from\r\nphotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SELECTION OF SITE.\r\n\r\nThe apiary should be located where no surface water will collect\r\nduring heavy storms, yet the ground should not be very uneven, but\r\nrather a gentle slope. In the colder portions of the United States\r\na south-eastern exposure is decidedly preferable, though in the\r\nSouth the slope of the site is less important to the welfare of the\r\nbees; a direct southern or south western exposure, however, will\r\nbe found extremely uncomfortable at times both for the operator and\r\nfor his bees. A windbreak, such as a board fence, a hedge, or a row\r\nof evergreens on the north and west, is advisable as a protection\r\nagainst sharp winds in winter and early spring, which keep many bees\r\nfrom reaching their hives even when near the entrances. Some shade\r\nis desirable, yet such density as to produce dampness is extremely\r\ndetrimental. In moist elevated regions, which are of course cool,\r\nno shade will be needed, except temporarily for newly hived swarms.\r\nTall trees are objectionable in or near the apiary, because swarms\r\nare likely to cluster so high as to render their capture difficult\r\nand dangerous. Some of the self-hivers or nous warming devices now\r\noffered for sale may with improvement yet accomplish the end in view,\r\nbut heretofore clipping one wing of each laying queen and using all\r\nprecautions to prevent after-swarming, making artificial swarms,\r\nselection in breeding, or any other means known to limit swarming,\r\nhave not sufficed to prevent the occasional issuance of a swarm with\r\na queen having wings. Therefore it is advisable to have the apiary\r\nlocated under or near low trees, where the hives can be readily seen\r\nfrom the house. Carniolan, Italian, and Cyprian bees give less trouble\r\nto passers-by or to live stock than do the ordinary brown or German\r\nbees, or hybrids of these races, yet whatever race be kept, it is best\r\nto have the apiary as secluded as the necessary or desirable conditions\r\nwill permit.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece and figures 20, 21, and 75, taken from photographs of\r\napiaries located in different parts of the country, give a fair idea of\r\nsites actually occupied and the arrangement of hive-.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--An apiary in California. (Reproduced from\r\nphotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                        =HIVES AND IMPLEMENTS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe safest and best rule in making or selecting hives and implements\r\nfor the apiary is, _have them simple and accurate in construction_. A\r\nplain box with frames and as few other loose parts as possible will\r\nyield in the hands of a skillful bee-master far better results than the\r\nmost elaborately constructed bee palace manipulated by one who does\r\nnot understand the nature and requirements of bees; in fact, the most\r\nexperienced generally prefer the former. The important point to decide\r\nin connection with any proposed modification or adjunct of the hive is\r\nwhether its adoption will more than compensate for the resultant loss\r\nof simplicity. While zealously endeavoring to preserve simplicity of\r\nconstruction, however, complete adaptability to the purpose designed\r\nmust be kept in view, and should not be sacrificed because of a\r\nslight added expense. The bee keeper needs but few implements. With\r\neven a limited number of hives, a smoker, a wax extractor, and a few\r\nqueen-introducing cages are the most necessary, and one or two bee\r\nveils had better be added to the equipment, the total cost of which\r\nneed not exceed $5 to $6. If the intention be to produce comb honey,\r\nand but a few hives are kept, then sections folded and with starters\r\nin place had better be purchased, but with ten or more hives and time\r\nduring the winter season to prepare sections for the harvest, a section\r\nfolder and a foundation fastener, costing together about $3, may be\r\nprofitably added to the outfit. If only extracted honey is wanted a\r\nhoney extractor with one or two uncapping knives should be purchased\r\ninstead of the section folder and foundation fastener, the cost of the\r\noutfit being in this case some $15 to $18. Fifty or even seventy-five\r\nhives may be managed conveniently and economically with no greater\r\ninvestment in implements than that indicated above, and if both comb\r\nand extracted honey are wanted the cost of the outfit, it can readily\r\nbe seen, need not exceed $20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HIVES.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the particular style or form of hive to be used to insure\r\nthe best results, it should be stated that while an intelligent\r\napiarist whose experience has been considerable may be successful with\r\nalmost any hive, even with poor ones, there can be no doubt that a hive\r\nnot only adapted to the nature of the bees but also to the climate of\r\nthe bee keeper's particular locality, and at the same time permitting\r\nthe rapid performance of all operations necessary in securing surplus\r\nhoney, will very materially affect the net profit of an apiary. This\r\nbeing the case, the original cost of a hive, whether a dollar or two\r\nmore or less, is of small importance compared with the desirability of\r\nsecuring convenience and simplicity in its management and of promoting\r\nthe welfare of the bees in winter and summer. Frame hives managed\r\nwith intelligence and skill are essential to the greatest success.\r\nInaccurately made frame hives, neglected, as is too frequently the\r\ncase, so that the combs are built irregularly between or across the\r\nframes, are not one whit better than box hives. Even an accurately\r\nbuilt frame hive, if no attention is given to the spacing of the frames\r\nwhen combs are being built, will soon present no advantages over a box\r\nhive of the same dimensions and having the same space for supering\r\nabove the brood apartment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Ancient Greek movable comb hive. (After _La\r\nMaison rustique_, published in 1742.)]\r\n\r\nThe frame and hive most in use in this country is the invention of\r\nRev. L. L. Langstroth, and this hive, with slight modifications,\r\nhas been generally adopted in England and her colonies. It is also\r\nbecoming known and appreciated on the continent of Europe. The patent\r\non the frame the essential feature--expired many years ago, so that\r\nanyone who may wish to do so is now free to employ the invention. It\r\nis still used by many in the same form in which it was brought out in\r\n1852. Others have changed the dimensions of the frames and given them\r\ndifferent names, while retaining the special feature of the inventor's\r\nprinciple, namely, the loose-fitting frame suspended by the projecting\r\nends of its top bar on a continuous rabbet. The outside dimensions of\r\nthe Langstroth frame most in use are 17⅝ inches long by 9⅛ inches deep\r\n(fig. 24). Mr. M. Quinby, one of the most practical and successful\r\nbee-masters of our century, preferred frames 12 inches deep by 18\r\ninches Long, and these are still used by many large honey raisers.\r\nOther sizes are also used somewhat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Dadant-Quinby form of Langstroth hive, with\r\ncap and gable roof. (Redrawn from Langstroth on the Honey Bee.)]\r\n\r\nThe bars composing frames are usually made seven-eighths inch wide,\r\nalthough some prefer to have the top bar 1 inch or even 1⅛ inches wide,\r\nand the bottom bar is made by some as narrow as live-eighths inch or\r\neven three-eighths inch square. The narrower bottom bar, at least down\r\nto a width of five eighths inch, renders the removal of the frames\r\nless difficult, and bees are brushed off a little more easily; but\r\nwhen combs cut from box hives are to be fitted into the frames it is\r\nnot quite so easy to hold the pieces in the center of the frame by\r\nmeans of transferring sticks and get the bees to fasten them securely\r\nat the bottom as it is with full seven-eighths-inch bottom bars. Top\r\nbars have been made by some hive manufacturers from one-fourth-inch to\r\nthree-eighths-inch strips, strengthened somewhat by a very thin strip\r\nplaced edgewise on the underside as a comb guide; but such bars are\r\nmuch too light and will sag when filled with honey or with brood and\r\nhoney, and when section holders or other receptacles for surplus honey\r\nor sets of combs are placed above them more than a bee space exists\r\nbetween the upper and lower sets of frames or between the section\r\nholder and the frames below, and the bees will fill in with bits of\r\ncomb between these, making it difficult to remove the top story or\r\nany of the combs from it; indeed, an attempt under such circumstances\r\nto remove combs from the top story generally results in tearing the\r\nframes apart and breaking the combs, and if honey leaks out robbing\r\nmay be induced at some times of the year, all because of an error in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Langstroth frame; size, 17⅝ in. by 9⅛ in.\r\noutside; _pn_, projecting nail. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Form in which to nail frames: _b_, button;\r\n_db_, double button. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nTo avoid this the top bar should never be less than five-eighths inch\r\nto three-fourths inch thick, while for long top bars seven-eighths-inch\r\nor 1-inch strips are preferable. The side and bottom bars may be made\r\nof one-fourth-inch strips. A corner is taken from the end of the top\r\nbar by a cross cut made at exactly right angles on the underside of the\r\ntop bar, reaching to within one-fourth inch of the top of the bar, and\r\nanother cut from the end so as to meet the first-mentioned one. Each\r\nside bar can then be nailed by one nail driven from above through the\r\ntop bar, and two driven through the side bar itself into the end of\r\nthe top bar. The bottom bar can then be nailed on, or, better still,\r\ncut short enough to permit it to be inserted between the side bars,\r\nthe nails holding it to be driven through the latter. Nailing frames\r\nloosely or without getting them exactly in true brings with it great\r\ndisadvantages. If only slightly out of shape they may swing together\r\nat the bottom or touch the sides of the hive, and in either case will\r\nbe glued fast by the bees; also in the first instance the combs, which\r\nare always built perpendicularly, will not be wholly within the frames.\r\nTo avoid these troubles it is essential, first, that the parts for the\r\nframes be cut very accurately; second, that the frame be in exact shape\r\nat the time of nailing; and third, that the nails be driven in quite\r\nfirmly; long, slender, flat-headed wire nails being necessary to secure\r\nproper stiffness of the frame. Nails 1½ to 1¾ inches long made of No.\r\n16 or No, 17 wire, or 4d. fine wire nails are the right size. Nailing\r\nin a form, such as is shown by fig. 25, is therefore advisable. Greater\r\nease in withdrawing the frames from the hive is secured by making the\r\nbottom of the frame one-fourth inch less in width than the upper part.\r\nA round-headed nail or a curved wire staple driven through the side bar\r\nat each lower corner into the end of the bottom bar and left projecting\r\none fourth inch will also facilitate the removal of frames and their\r\ninsertion in the hive without the crushing of bees, and hence allow\r\nmore rapid manipulation. (Fig. 24, _pn_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Lock-joint chaff hive. (From Gleanings in Bee\r\nCulture.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Manner of nailing hives. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe hive to hold the frames should be the plainest kind of a box, the\r\nframes resting on rabbets made in the upper edges. Constructing it\r\nwith lock joints, as shown in fig. 26, or by halving together the ends\r\nof the boards, as in fig. 27, and, in either case, nailing in both\r\ndirections makes a strong hive body. The latter may be single-walled\r\nfor mild climates or where cellar wintering is practiced: but for\r\nsevere regions it is advisable to have permanent double walls with the\r\ninter-spaces filled with chaff, ground cork, or similar material, or\r\nelse outer cases should be provided giving space between the latter\r\nand the hive proper for dry packing. As the bees always try to glue\r\nthe frames fast by means of propolis, it is better to make them rest\r\non strips of tin, galvanized iron, or band iron. The rabbet should\r\ntherefore be made eleven-sixteenths inch deep, and the strip of iron or\r\nother metal frame-rest nailed on so that its edge will project upward\r\nfive-sixteenths inch from the bottom of the rabbet. Folded strips of\r\ntin as made by manufacturers of apiarian implements are preferable to\r\nsingle strips nailed on, since they facilitate the sliding of frames\r\nand do not cut the top bars where the latter rest upon them (fig. 28).\r\nThe projecting ends of the top bars being one-fourth inch thick, the\r\nbars themselves come within one-eighth inch of the upper edge of the\r\nhive. It is essential that the distance between the ends of the frames\r\nand the hive should not exceed three-eighths inch, lest in time of\r\nplenty the bees should build comb there; nor can less than one-fourth\r\ninch space be allowed, for if the bees can not readily pass around the\r\nends of frames of the Langstroth type they will glue the frames to the\r\nside walls of the hive, making it very difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto remove them without breakage. If, as suggested, the frames are made\r\none-fourth inch shorter at the bottom than at the top, that is, 17⅜\r\ninches at bottom and 17⅝ inches at top, the hive should then be 18⅛\r\ninches inside from front to rear, the frames running in this direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Section of improved tin frame-rest: _A_,\r\nfolded edge on which frame rests; _B_ and _D_, nails. (From Gleanings.)]\r\n\r\nIf the frames are accurately made there will then be one fourth inch\r\nspace at each end of the frame just below the top bar and three-eighths\r\ninch at each end of the bottom bar. Between the frames and the bottom\r\nboard, on which the hive rests, one-half inch space answers, but\r\nfive-eighths inch is preferable. The width of the hive will depend, of\r\ncourse, upon the number of frames decided upon, 1⅜ inches being allowed\r\nfor each frame, and three-eighths inch added for the extra space at\r\nthe side. If a top story to contain frames for extracting is placed\r\nover the brood chamber, its depth is to be such as to leave the space\r\nbetween the two sets of combs not over five-sixteenths inch, and in\r\nthis, as in the lower story, the space between the ends of the frames\r\nand the hive wall should be no more than three-eighths inch. A good way\r\nto keep rain from beating in between the stories and also to retain\r\nthe warmth of the bees in outdoor wintering, yet admit of suitable\r\nprovision for the upward escape of moisture, is to have the second\r\nstory fit over the top of the lower one, and rest on ledges made by\r\nnailing strips around the latter one-half inch below the upper edge. As\r\nthis makes the upper story nearly 2 inches larger from front to rear\r\nthan the lower one: it will be necessary when arranging this story for\r\nframes to make the front and rear double-walled. This is easily done\r\nby tacking on the inside of each end two half-inch strips, on which a\r\nhalt-inch board is then nailed. These inside end pieces should be only\r\nwide enough to reach within three-fourths inch of the top edge of the\r\nouter ends, and, like the lower story, should be finished at the top\r\nwith a metal rabbet for the frames to rest on, or the inside piece may\r\nbe made to come within three-eighths inch of the top and its upper edge\r\nbeveled so the frames can not be greatly propolized, an arrangement\r\nwhich answers very well for this story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--The Langstroth hive--Dadant-Quinby form--cross\r\nsection showing construction. (From Langstroth.)]\r\n\r\nAs to the width of hives and consequent number of frames each story\r\nis to hold, there has been of late much diversity of opinion. The\r\noriginal Langstroth hive held ten frames in the lower story and eleven\r\nframes in the second or top story. A demand for smaller-sized brood\r\nchambers and uniformity of the stories having been created, the larger\r\nhive-manufacturing establishments gave hives constructed to hold eight\r\nframes the most prominent place in their catalogues, and by many it\r\nwas considered that those who adhered to the older, larger form did so\r\nmerely through conservatism. But after some years' trial a reaction in\r\nfavor of larger hives seems to have set in, especially among producers\r\nof extracted honey. Many of the latter are finding that with carefully\r\nbred queens even twelve-frame brood apartments give the best results.\r\nThe author's experience of over twenty-five years with frame hives\r\nof various sizes and styles, both American and foreign, in widely\r\ndiffering climates, convinces him that to restrict a hive to a capacity\r\nof less than ten frames for the brood chamber is, in most localities,\r\nundesirable, but it will frequently be found advantageous to contract\r\ntemporarily the space occupied by the bees. For extracted honey alone,\r\nespecially in any region having a short flow of honey, twelve-frame\r\ncapacity is preferable. Thin, movable partitions, known as \"division\r\nboards,\" enable one to contract the space at will, and the addition of\r\nsupers or top stories gives storage room for surplus honey. Some prefer\r\nto have the hive in one story holding twice the usual number of frames\r\nand contractible with a division board. The entrance is then usually\r\nat one end, parallel with the combs, and the surplus honey is obtained\r\nfrom the rear part of the hive, either in sections held in wide frames\r\nor it is extracted with a machine from ordinary frames. This plan\r\nrenders access to all of the frames somewhat easier than when two or\r\nmore stories are used, but as the methods now most followed involve\r\non the whole less manipulation of individual frames than was formerly\r\ndeemed advantageous this superiority can not count for much--hardly\r\nenough in fact to balance the limitation as to the number of frames and\r\nthe inconvenience of larger and more unwieldy hive bodies, covers, and\r\nbottom boards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--The Nonpareil hire. (From Bee-Keeping for\r\nProfit.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Dadant-Quinby form of Langstroth hive, open:\r\n_a_, front of brood apartment; _b_, alighting board; _c_, movable\r\nentrance block; _d_, cap; _e_, straw mat; _f_, carriage-cloth cover for\r\nframes; _g, g_, frames with combs. (From Langstroth.)]\r\n\r\nSmall hives may yield excellent results in the hands of a skillful\r\nbee-master, but an equal degree of skill will, in general, give as\r\ngood, if not better, returns from large hives, and the novice who may\r\nnot know just when or how to perform all operations will find himself\r\nmuch safer with hives holding ten or twelve frames in each story, and\r\nfar more likely to secure good returns from them than from smaller ones.\r\n\r\nA good, tight roof or cover is indispensable, well painted, so that\r\nno drop of water can get in from above. A flat roof slanting from\r\nfront to rear will answer, but a ventilated gable roof with the sides\r\nwell slanted is far preferable. Above the sections or the upper set\r\nof frames a piece of carriage cloth, enameled side down, should be\r\nlaid during the summer season to prevent too great escape of heat\r\nabove and to keep the bees from getting into the roof or propolizing\r\nit. The cloth is more suitable than a board, since the latter when\r\npropolized can not be removed without considerably jarring the bees.\r\nIf the carriage cloth be weighted with a board which has been clamped\r\nwith a strip across each end to prevent warping, there will be less\r\npropolization of the sections above or building of bits of comb on the\r\ntops of the frames when these have been used. To dispense with this\r\nextra piece and also to render the gable cover flat on the underside,\r\nthe board which rests on the carriage cloth may be nailed to the cover\r\npermanently. During very hot weather the quilt may be turned back and\r\nthe cover propped up.\r\n\r\nThe bottom board to the hive may be nailed permanently or the hive\r\nmay be merely placed on it. In either case the sides and back of the\r\nhive should be wide enough to come down over the edges of the bottom\r\nboard and thus shed all water that runs down the outside of the hive.\r\nA sloping board in front will facilitate the entrance of heavily laden\r\nbees and many that fall to the ground will crawl in if the hive is\r\nwithin 8 or 10 inches of the ground. Many persons place the bottom\r\nboards directly on the ground, and the majority have them but 3 or 4\r\ninches above the surface. By arranging them farther from the ground, at\r\nleast 6 or 8 inches, dampness is avoided and the ease in manipulation\r\nis greatly increased. English manufacturers make the Langstroth hive\r\nwith permanent legs some 6 or 8 inches long. This is no doubt necessary\r\nin the damp climate of that country, and even here the free circulation\r\nof the air beneath the hive and the entrance of direct rays of sunlight\r\nat times are so beneficial that there might well be a return to this\r\nvaluable feature, which was part of the original Langstroth hive.\r\n\r\nGreat accuracy of parts must be insisted upon in hives and frames, both\r\nbecause covers and top stories should be made to fit interchangeably,\r\nand because the bees carry out their own work with great precision,\r\nso that ease in manipulation of combs can only be secured by nice\r\nadjustment. Hives cut by machinery are therefore greatly to be\r\npreferred, and though most of those kept in stock by apiarian\r\nmanufacturers do not include in their construction all of the features\r\nmentioned above, they still answer in most particulars the requirements\r\nof bee life, and, if proper protection for the winter be afforded, are\r\nvery serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n                             BEE SMOKERS.\r\n\r\nNo well-appointed apiary in these days is without one or more bee\r\nsmokers. The professional bee keeper who has once used a bellows smoker\r\nwould as soon think of dispensing with this implement as a skillful\r\ncook would be disposed to go back from the modern cooking range to the\r\nold-fashioned fireplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--The Bingham bee smoker.]\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years smoke has been used to quell and even stupefy\r\nbees, and various forms of bee smokers have long been used; but the\r\nmodern bellows form, so far superior to the old clumsy implements which\r\noftentimes required both hands of the operator, or to be held between\r\nthe teeth, is purely an American invention. Mr. M. Quinby, one of the\r\npioneers in improved methods in apiculture in America, was the inventor\r\nof the bellows smoker having the fire box at the side of the bellows\r\nso arranged as to enable the operator to work it with one hand, and\r\nwhen not in use to stand it upright and secure a draft which would keep\r\nthe fire going. Certain improvements on the original Quinby smoker\r\nhave been made without changing the general form of the implement, one\r\nof the most effective and durable of these improved makes being the\r\nBingham direct-draft smoker. Other modifications are the Crane, with\r\na cut-off valve, the Clark, Hill, and Corneil smokers. The medium and\r\nlarger sized smokers, even for use in small apiaries, are preferable.\r\nThey light easier, take in all kinds of fuel, and hold fire better,\r\nwhile they are always much more effective since they furnish a large\r\nvolume of smoke at a given instant, thus nipping in the bud any\r\nincipient rebellion. The bee smoker and its use are well shown by figs.\r\n12, 32, and 53.\r\n\r\n                                VEILS.\r\n\r\nVeils for the protection of the face will be needed at times--for\r\nvisitors if not for the manipulator. The beginner, however, should use\r\none under all circumstances until he has acquired some skill in opening\r\nhives and manipulating frames and has become acquainted with the temper\r\nand notes of bees, so that he will have confidence when they are\r\nbuzzing about him and will know when it is really safe to dispense with\r\nthe face protector. Veils are made of various materials. In those which\r\noffer the least obstruction to the sight, black silk tulle or brussels\r\nnet is used, the meshes of which are hexagonal. Linen brussels net is\r\nmore durable than silk, as is also cotton, though the latter turns gray\r\nin time and obstructs the vision. By making the front only of silk and\r\nthe sides of some ordinary white cotton netting the cost of the veil\r\nis less, but it is not so comfortable to wear in hot weather, being\r\nless open. A rubber cord is drawn into the upper edge, which brings\r\nthe latter snugly in about the hat band. By having the veil long and\r\nfull and drawing it over a straw hat with a wide, stiff brim, tying the\r\nlower edge about the shoulders or buttoning it inside a jacket or coat,\r\nthe face is securely protected. (Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\n                  HONEY EXTRACTORS AND HONEY KNIVES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Williams' automatic reversible honey\r\nextractor.]\r\n\r\nThe honey extractor (fig. 33) consists of a large can, within which a\r\nlight metal basket revolves. The full combs of honey, from which the\r\ncappings of the cells have been removed by a sharp knife, are placed\r\ninside the basket and after several rapid revolutions by means of a\r\nsimple gearing are found to have been emptied of their contents. The\r\ncombs, only very slightly damaged, can then be returned to the hives to\r\nbe refilled by the bees. If extra sets of combs are on hand to supply\r\nas fast as the bees need the room in which to store honey, great yields\r\ncan often be obtained. A good extractor should be made of metal, and\r\nthe basket in which the combs are revolved should be light, strong, and\r\ndoubly braced on the outside so that the wire-cloth surface, against\r\nwhich the combs press, will not yield. The wire cloth used, as well\r\nas all interior parts of the extractor, should be tinned, as acids\r\nof honey act on galvanized iron, zinc, iron, etc. Wire cloth made of\r\ncoarse wire and with meshes one-half inch square is often used, but it\r\ninjures the surface of new combs and those very heavy with honey more\r\nthan that made of about No. 20 wire and with one-fourth-inch meshes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Quinby uncapping knife.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Bingham & Hetherington uncapping knife.]\r\n\r\nFor removing the wax covering with which the bees close the full cells\r\na peculiarly shaped knife, known as an uncapping knife, is needed\r\n(figs. 34 and 35). The blade, which should be of the finest steel to\r\nhold a keen edge, is fixed at such an angle with the handle as to keep\r\nthe hand that grasps the latter from rubbing over the surface of the\r\ncomb or the edges of the frames. The form of knife with curved point is\r\nbest adapted to reach any depression in the comb, which, if uncapped\r\nand emptied of its honey, will likely next time be built out even with\r\nthe general surface. Dipping the knife in hot water facilitates rapid\r\nwork, and of course the heavier-bladed knives hold the heat better than\r\nthin bladed ones, and are for this reason preferred by some; also\r\nbecause they more surely lift the capping clear from the surface of the\r\ncomb.\r\n\r\n                            WAX EXTRACTORS.\r\n\r\nA solar wax extractor is needed in every apiary; several are kept\r\nrunning in many large apiaries. Extractors which render wax by steam\r\nare also used. To the latter class belongs the improved Swiss wax\r\nextractor (fig. 36). This implement, invented in Switzerland and\r\nimproved in America, consists of a tin or copper vessel with a circle\r\nof perforations in the bottom near the sides to let in steam from a\r\nboiler below, and within this upper vessel another receptacle--the comb\r\nreceiver--made of perforated zinc. Its use, as well as that of the\r\nsolar wax extractor, is described under the head of \"Wax production.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Excelsior wax extractor.]\r\n\r\nWithin a few years wax extractors employing the heat of the sun and\r\nknown as solar wax extractors have come into general use (fig. 61).\r\nThe essential features in all the forms that have been devised are a\r\nmetal tank with a glass cover and usually a wire-cloth strainer, below\r\nwhich is placed the receptacle for the wax, the whole so arranged as to\r\nenable one to tilt it at such an angle as will catch the direct rays\r\nof the sun. The effectiveness of the solar wax extractor is increased\r\nby having the glass doubled, and adding also a reflector, such as\r\na mirror or a sheet of bright metal. An important advantage of the\r\nsolar wax extractor is the ease with which small quantities of comb\r\ncan be rendered. By having this machine much is therefore saved that\r\nmight be ruined by wax moth larvæ if allowed to accumulate, besides\r\nserving at the same time to increase these pests about the apiary. The\r\nwax obtained by solar heat is also of superior quality, being clean,\r\nnever water-soaked nor scorched, and also light in color, owing to the\r\nbleaching action of the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a medium-sized solar wax extractor does not exceed that of\r\nthe larger Swiss steam extractors, yet of the two the former is likely\r\nto prove by far the more valuable, even though it can be used only\r\nduring the warmer months.\r\n\r\n                       QUEEN-INTRODUCING CAGES.\r\n\r\nIn every apiary there should be several of these on hand. The best are\r\nsuch as permit the caging of the queen directly on the comb over cells\r\nof honey. A little practice will enable anyone to make very serviceable\r\nand cheap cages for introducing queens. From a piece of wire cloth\r\nhaving ten to twelve meshes to the inch cut a strip 2 inches wide; cut\r\nthis in pieces 4¼ inches long, roll each piece around a stick to give\r\nit a cylindrical form, lap the edges, and sew with a piece of wire.\r\nThen in one end of this cylinder make slits three-quarters inch apart\r\nand three-quarters inch deep, and bend over the tongues thus formed so\r\nas to close this end of the cage. With the flat end of a pencil press\r\nwarm wax or comb into the bottom inside to give it firmness. Then\r\nunravel five or six strands of the wire cloth at the other end. The\r\nwire points left after unraveling these strands may be pressed into\r\nthe comb so as to confine a queen and four or five of her attendant\r\nworkers. (Fig. 66.)\r\n\r\nMost of the queen-mailing cages are arranged to admit of their use in\r\nintroducing the queens also, so that when received it is only necessary\r\nto withdraw a cork and place the cage on top of the brood frames, thus\r\nadmitting the bees to the candy. They will eat their way in and release\r\nthe queen in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. This plan is very good\r\nfor such as lack experience in handling queens, and hence might injure\r\nthem by grasping the abdomen, by pinching the thorax too hard, or by\r\ncatching the legs on the wire cloth of the introducing cage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Simplicity feeder. (From A B C of Bee\r\nCulture.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Fruit-jar bee feeder. Bottom of feeding stage\r\nand perforated cap shown separately. (Orig.)]\r\n\r\n                             BEE FEEDERS.\r\n\r\nDuring warm weather liquid food may be placed in any open receptacles\r\nwhich can be set in the upper stories of the hives. Tin fruit or\r\nvegetable cans that have been used may be made to serve the purpose,\r\na wooden float for each or some bits of comb being put in to keep the\r\nbees from drowning; but during cool weather feeders arranged to admit\r\nthe bees but not permit the escape of heat had better be employed.\r\nGlass fruit jars with metal caps are generally at Land, and make\r\nexcellent feeders by merely punching a few holes in each cap. After the\r\njar is filled with liquid food and the cap screwed on tightly it is\r\ninverted over a feed hole in the quilt or honey board. The cap, or top\r\nstory, with cover, protects the whole, and it is very easy to see when\r\nmore food is wanted by merely raising the cover slightly. If arranged\r\non a feeding stage covered on the underside with wire cloth, as shown\r\nin fig. 38, feeding may be accomplished without being troubled by the\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nFeeders of various forms constructed of wood or tin, or of these\r\nmaterials combined, most of them serving the purpose excellently, are\r\noffered in catalogues of apiarian manufacturers.\r\n\r\n                           SECTION FOLDERS.\r\n\r\nSections can be folded or put together readily over an accurately made\r\nblock just large enough to fill the space inclosed by a section, and\r\nseveral machines to facilitate the work in case it is to be done on a\r\nlarge scale have been devised.\r\n\r\n                             BEE ESCAPES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--The Porter spring bee escape.]\r\n\r\nThe bee escape (fig. 39) is an important labor-saving invention for the\r\nhoney producer. A number of them may be regarded as necessary in every\r\napiary. They are inserted in holes bored in a honey board and used in\r\nfreeing supers from bees, as described under \"Honey production.\"\r\n\r\n                         FOUNDATION FASTENERS.\r\n\r\n_For sections._--Several styles of implements for fastening thin\r\nfoundation in sections have been devised. All of them do the work well.\r\nA simple one, which is also low priced, is Parker's; Clark's and the\r\nDaisy are also highly recommended, and A. C. Miller's is very complete,\r\nworking automatically. The latter, and the Daisy shown in fig. 40, each\r\nrequire the use of a lamp.\r\n\r\n_For frames._--If the top bars of the frames have a slot or saw kerf\r\none-eighth to three-sixteenths inch deep on the underside, made by\r\npassing them lengthwise over a circular saw, sheets of foundation\r\ncan be very readily fastened by slipping the edge into this groove\r\nand running melted wax along the angle formed on each side by the\r\nfoundation and the top bar. Or a wedge-shaped strip may be crowded in\r\nat the side and secured with small wire nails. If the top bar is flat\r\non the underside it will be necessary to press the foundation firmly\r\nagainst it; that is, to incorporate the edge of the wax sheet into the\r\nwood of the top bar by rubbing it with a smooth bit of hard wood or\r\nbone, such as a knife handle, moistening this implement to prevent the\r\nwax from sticking, and then fix it firmly by pouring melted wax down\r\nthe other side. In the case of top bars having triangular comb guides\r\nor a projecting tongue on the underside the foundation can be securely\r\nfastened by merely cutting five or six slits three-eighths to one-half\r\ninch deep in one edge of the foundation and bending the tongues thus\r\nformed in alternate directions so as to place the V-edge of the top\r\nbar between them, when they can be firmly attached to the top bar by\r\nrubbing with a knife handle as before. Soapsuds or starch water may\r\nbe used to advantage in moistening the knife handle. The foundation\r\nroller (fig. 41), a small disk of hard wood which revolves in a slot\r\nat the end of a handle and costs but a few cents, does effective work\r\nin fastening foundation in brood frames; in fact, it is rather better\r\nthan the knife handle for the work just mentioned, except that it will\r\nnot reach into the corners of the frames, and to secure the foundation\r\nthere the knife handle must still be used. The roller will need to be\r\nmoistened the same as the knife handle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--The Daisy foundation fastener. (From\r\nGleanings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Fastening starter of comb foundation in frame.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nIt is particularly important that the sheets of foundation be well\r\nfastened, for if one edge breaks loose with the weight of the bees\r\nit will crumple down in such a way as not only to ruin that comb, or\r\nrather to prevent the building of a good comb in the frame in question,\r\nbut also very likely in the adjoining frames if they have not been\r\npreviously built out; and in this case damage will probably result to\r\nthem. To prevent bulging of the comb it is also essential that the\r\nsheets of foundation, if not wired, be narrower than the inside depth\r\nof the frame and shorter than its inside length. A full inch of space\r\nshould be allowed between the bottom bar and the sheet of foundation,\r\nand a half inch at each end for two-thirds of the way up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Spur wire-embedder. (From Gleanings.)]\r\n\r\nWith these precautions swarms may even be hived on full sheets of\r\nfoundation without wiring the frames: but the practice will probably\r\ncontinue of using starters, chiefly in the case of swarms, and, when\r\nfull sheets are employed, of alternating them with combs already built\r\nout. Some prefer to wire the frames even though it is considerable\r\ntrouble, for the combs require less attention while in process of\r\nconstruction and are firmer for shipping, for use in the extractor,\r\nor for any other manipulation. Three or four horizontal wires will\r\nsuffice. No. 30 annealed tinned wire is the preferable size and\r\nquality. The end bars of the frame are pierced by four holes, the first\r\n1 inch below the top bar. A small tack secures the end of the wire,\r\nwhich is then passed back and forth and drawn up so as to leave no\r\nslack. The four horizontal wires, 2 inches apart, will be sufficient\r\nto render combs quite secure. After fastening the foundation to the\r\ntop bar in the usual way the wires are embedded in the wax by a spur\r\nembedder, which is a small wheel with grooved teeth (fig. 42). Where\r\nlarge numbers of frames are to be wired a current of electricity from\r\na small battery will do the work more neatly and quickly than the spur\r\nembedder.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of wiring frames are, first, its expense, caused\r\nchiefly by the time employed in doing it; and second, the fact that\r\nwherever the wire does not get embedded into the midrib of the\r\nfoundation, as is sure to happen in many cases, the rearing of brood is\r\ninterfered with, and also, under the methods employed by the majority\r\nin wintering, moisture is very likely to cause the combs to cleave from\r\nthe wires, whereupon the bees are disposed to gnaw the combs away from\r\nthe wires in spots and not rebuild them.\r\n\r\nThese disadvantages, except that of expense, are overcome by\r\nincorporating fine wire in the sheets of foundation when they are\r\nrolled. The sheets are trimmed with wooden shears, which leave the ends\r\nof the wires projecting. These are then glued to the bars of the frame.\r\nThe added expense is again the main objection, except to those who wish\r\nto ship colonies or nuclei, or transport them from place to place for\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\n                       COMB-FOUNDATION MACHINES.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to give bees outlines of cells as a basis for comb\r\nbuilding were made in Germany. The top bars of the frames were coated\r\non the underside with beeswax, and a strip of wood having the outlines\r\nof bees' cells cut on it was then pressed against this wax so as to\r\nform a guide which should lead the bees to build their combs within the\r\nframes. This was only a comb guide, but was succeeded by small strips\r\nof wax having the outlines of bees' cells pressed on them by hand,\r\na block of wood being engraved for this purpose. The general use of\r\ncomb foundation, especially of the full sheets, was only made possible\r\nthrough the improved means of manufacturing it developed in the United\r\nStates. The slow process of hand stamping was succeeded by its rapid\r\nproduction on machines, the essential feature of which is two engraved\r\ncylinders between which the warm sheet of wax is made to pass (fig. 43).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Comb-foundation machine. (From Langstroth.)]\r\n\r\nSuch machines are now made in numerous patterns costing from $15 up.\r\nFoundation is made with flat-bottomed cells and also with the same form\r\nas that given by the bees to combs constructed wholly by themselves.\r\nBoth sorts are readily accepted by the bees and built out. Both these\r\nkinds are also made in various qualities and weights. Only a good\r\nquality of perfectly pure beeswax should be accepted. Brood foundation\r\nis made in light, medium, and heavy weights. For use in section boxes\r\nthin surplus and extra thin surplus are made of light-colored wax. When\r\nfull sheets are used in sections it is better to have it extra thin\r\nlest there should be a noticeable toughness of the midrib, technically\r\nknown as \"fishbone.\" For unwired frames the medium or heavy brood-comb\r\nfoundation should be employed.\r\n\r\nUntil used it is best to keep comb foundation between sheets of paper\r\nand well wrapped, since if long exposed to the air the surface of the\r\nwax hardens somewhat, but if well packed it may be used years after it\r\nwas made with almost the same advantage as when first rolled out.\r\n\r\nIt requires considerable skill to make foundation successfully, and\r\nthose who use but a small amount will do better to purchase their\r\nsupply. The high quality of nearly all of the foundation thus far\r\nsupplied in this country has also justified this plan. Should the\r\npractice of adulterating wax become as common among comb-foundation\r\nmanufacturers in this country as on the continent of Europe no doubt\r\nmany more would procure machines and make their own foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                           =BEE PASTURAGE.=\r\n\r\n\r\nBees obtain their food from such a variety of sources that there\r\nare few localities in our country where a small apiary could not be\r\nmade to yield a surplus above its own needs. Even in the center of\r\nour larger cities bees placed on the roofs of stores and dwellings\r\nhave often furnished quite a surplus gathered from the gardens of\r\nthe city and its environs. Again, in regions where the soil is too\r\nlight, rocky, or wet to admit of profitable cultivation, it is often\r\nthe case that honey-producing plants abound; indeed, waste land is\r\nfrequently far more profitable for the honey-producer than fields that\r\nhave been brought under cultivation, especially when the latter are\r\nmainly devoted to grain or potato raising, for insignificant weeds\r\nin field or swamp often yield honey abundantly, and among the best\r\nyielders are certain forest trees, whose blossoms, by reason of their\r\ndistance from the ground and in some instances their small size, escape\r\nnotice. Showy flowers made double by the gardener's skill, such as\r\nroses, dahlias, chrysanthemums, etc., have rarely any attraction for\r\nour honey bees. Moreover, the small number of these ornamental plants\r\nusually found in any one locality renders the honey yield, even in\r\ncase they are abundant secreters of nectar, so slight that they are\r\nof little value. The novice who is seeking to determine the honey\r\nresources of his locality should therefore not be led into error by\r\nthese. He should compare the flora of his locality with reliable lists\r\nof honey-producing plants, and, if possible, consult some practical\r\nbee-master familiar with his surroundings. And all information on this\r\nscore should be fully accepted only after careful verification, as it\r\nis very easy for anyone to be deceived regarding the sources of given\r\nhoney yields--plants which produce abundantly one season not always\r\nyielding the next, or those that produce honey freely in one portion\r\nof the country not yielding anything in another. Soil and climate, the\r\nvariations of successive seasons, and all other conditions affecting\r\nplant growth--conditions which even the most skillful scientific\r\nagriculturists admit are exceedingly difficult to understand, and in\r\nmany respects, as yet unexplainable--influence the amount and quality\r\nof nectar secreted by a given plant.\r\n\r\nThe danger of overstocking is largely imaginary, yet in establishing\r\na large apiary it is of course essential to look to the natural\r\nresources of the location, and especially to decide only upon a place\r\nwhere two or more of the leading honey-producing plants are present in\r\ngreat numbers. In the North, willows, alder, maples, dandelion, fruit\r\nblossoms, tulip tree (frequently called whitewood), locust, clovers\r\n(white, alsike, crimson, and mammoth red), with alfalfa and melilot,\r\nchestnut, linden or basswood, Indian corn, buckwheat, fireweed,\r\nwillow-herb, knotweeds, mints, cleome, golden-rods, Spanish needle, and\r\nasters may be cited as the chief sources of pollen and honey; and of\r\nthese the tulip tree, locust, white clover, alfalfa, melilot, linden,\r\nand buckwheat furnish most of the surplus honey. The fruit blossoms,\r\nwith the exception of raspberry, come so early that a small proportion\r\nonly of the colonies are sufficiently strong to store surplus, and of\r\ncourse this statement applies with still more force to plants which\r\nblossom before apple, pear, cherry, etc. Some of the clovers, mustard,\r\nrape, cultivated teasel, chestnut, barberry, sumac coral berry,\r\npleurisy root, fireweed, borage, mints, willow-herb, Spanish needles,\r\ncleome, etc., though yielding well, are only found abundantly over\r\ncertain areas, and do not therefore supply any considerable portion\r\nof the honey that appears on the market, though when any of them are\r\nplentiful in a certain locality the bee keeper located there will find\r\nin nearly all cases that the surplus honey is greatly increased thereby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Willow herb (_Epilobium angustifolium_).

E, growing point of pollen\r\ngrain: _e, e_, extine; _i, i_, intine; _f_, fovilla; _pt_, pollen tube.\r\n(From Cheshire.)]\r\n\r\nIn the middle section of our country, from Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nNorth Carolina westward, most of the sources named above are present,\r\nalthough the maples (particularly hard maple) furnish less, and fruit\r\nbloom, the clovers, linden, and buckwheat are not as great yielders\r\nas in the North. Sourwood or sorrel tree, mountain laurels, sour gum\r\nor tupelo, huckleberry, cowpea, magnolia, and persimmon make up in\r\npart for these, the sourwood being especially important, while in some\r\nlocalities certain species of asters yield very abundantly. The tulip\r\ntree (known commonly as poplar) is a greater yielder than in the North,\r\nwhile in the western portion of the middle section the Rocky Mountain\r\nbee plant or cleome and more extensive areas of alfalfa and melilot are\r\nvery important sources.\r\n\r\nIn the more southern States fruit bloom is far from being as great a\r\nsource of honey as in the North, though with the extension of orange\r\ngroves in Florida and Louisiana an increased production of very fine\r\nhoney maybe looked for in those States. The titi, magnolia, palmetto,\r\nand black mangrove yield well in some parts, and sour gum (tupelo or\r\npepperidge), cotton, and pennyroyal are sources not to be overlooked.\r\nIn Texas horsemint and mesquite, the latter also extending farther\r\nWest, furnish fine yields, while many mountain localities of southern\r\nCalifornia are clothed with white and black sages--wonderful honey\r\nproducers. In certain localities there the orange and other fruit\r\norchards, and also wild buckwheat, give the bees excellent pasturage\r\nfor a portion of the year.\r\n\r\nCertain small homopterous insects, such as plant-lice, bark-lice,\r\nmealy-wings, and some leaf-hoppers, which congregate on the leaves or\r\nbark of various plants and trees, notably pines, oaks, and beeches,\r\nand suck their juices, secrete a sweet liquid, which is often taken\r\nup by bees as it falls on the surrounding vegetation. This secretion,\r\ncommonly known as honeydew, or plant-louse honey, is usually of an\r\ninferior qua lit y, though that from pine-tree aphides is sometimes\r\nfairly good. Most of it granulates very soon after having been\r\ngathered, sometimes even before the cells have been sealed.\r\n\r\nUnder peculiar conditions of the atmosphere sweet exudations, also\r\nknown as honeydew, drop from the leaves of certain plants and are\r\neagerly taken up by the bees. This substance is sometimes very abundant\r\nand of excellent quality. It should not, however, be confounded with\r\nthe secretions of extra-floral glands such as are possessed by the\r\ncowpea, horse bean, partridge pea, and vetches. These seem to be\r\nnatural productions for the purpose of attracting insects to the\r\nplants, while the former is apparently an accidental exudation through\r\nthe plant pores, brought about very likely by some sudden change of\r\ntemperature. Both are, however, merely the saccharine juices of the\r\nplant, and when refined by the bees may become excellent honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CULTIVATION OF HONEY PLANTS.\r\n\r\nIn all localities there will probably be found intervals during\r\nthe working season when bees will find very little or even nothing\r\ngather, unless supplied by cultivation. When possible it is ah best\r\nto till in such intervals with some honey-producing plant which at\r\nthe same time furnishes some other product--fruit, grain, forage,\r\ngreen manure, or timber. The attempt to cultivate any plant for its\r\nhoney alone has not thus far been found profitable, in practice,\r\nhowever promising it may seem theoretically. Catnip (_Nepeta\r\ncataria_), motherwort (_Leonurus cardiaca_), globe thistle (_Echinops\r\nsphærocephalus_), figwort (_Scrophularia nodosa_), bee balm (_Melissa\r\nofficinalis_), borage (_Borago officinalis_), Rocky Mountain cleome\r\n(_Cleome serrulata_), melilot or sweet clover (_Melilotus alba_), and\r\nlinden (_Tilia americana_) have all been recommended repeatedly and\r\ntried here and there somewhat extensively. But thus far the hope of\r\nsecuring a sufficient increase in the crop of honey to pay for the\r\ncultivation of these plants has in all cases had to be abandoned.\r\nWith the appreciation in value of agricultural lands the prospects\r\nfor the profitable cultivation of any crop for honey alone are still\r\nfurther removed. Yet the writer is fully convinced that in the future,\r\nespecially in the older portions of our country, eminent success in\r\nbee raising will require much more attention to the furnishing of\r\nartificial pasturage for the bees, a close study, in fact, of the\r\nbee flora of one's locality, and a systematic effort to supply the\r\ndeficiencies by sowing self-propagating honey plants, and such as may\r\nbe cultivated with profit for other reasons besides their honey yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Wagner a flat pea (_Lathyrus sylvestris\r\nwagneri_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Dwarf Essex or winter rape (_Brassica napus_).]\r\n\r\nAmong those plants which have just been mentioned as having been\r\ncultivated at various times for their honey alone, the linden for shade\r\nand ornament as well as for timber, catnip for sale as an herb or to\r\nsecure its seed, and melilot for forage or green manuring are the only\r\nones which, under present conditions, might in some cases be profitably\r\ncultivated. There may be introduced with advantage, however, all such\r\nhoney-producing plants as, with one sowing or planting, will readily\r\npropagate themselves and without cultivation extend their area along\r\nroadsides and over waste lands, always excepting of course such as may\r\nbecome troublesome weeds. For this purpose most of the plants referred\r\nto above are available, and many others which like these are adapted to\r\none portion or another of our country might be added, as, for example,\r\npleurisy root or butterfly weed (_Asclepias tuberosa_), Indian currant\r\nor coral berry (_Symphoricarpos symphoricarpos_), viper's bugloss\r\n(_Echium vulgare_), lady's thumb (_Polygonum persicaria_), horsemint\r\n(_Monarda citriodora_), willow-herb (_Epilobium angustifolium_),\r\netc., but of course it can not be expected that they will thrive and\r\nthoroughly establish themselves without further attention, except\r\nin such localities as present very favorable conditions for their\r\ngrowth. Furthermore, there is always the risk that a plant which yields\r\nhoney abundantly in one part of the country may not do so in another\r\nregion, even though it grows well, so that it is necessary in most\r\ncases, especially with wild plants, to test them anew before extensive\r\nintroduction, no matter how well established their reputation as honey\r\nproducers may be elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Summer or bird rape (_Brassica napus_).]\r\n\r\nAmong plants of economic value in other directions fruit trees and\r\nshrubs are to be counted as of much importance to bees. The apple and\r\nthe cherry yield well, the others less, though the gooseberry, were it\r\nmore plentiful, would be of considerable value. Strawberry blossoms\r\nare, in general, visited sparingly and yield only a small amount, but\r\nthe raspberry, coming later, when the colonies are stronger, is a most\r\nimportant source, greatly liked by the bees, and furnishing as fine a\r\nquality of honey as is known. Ten acres in raspberries will furnish\r\npasturage for three weeks to 75 or 100 colonies of bees. Mustard for\r\nseed, and rape for pasture and seed, may be made to furnish much to\r\nthe bees in early spring. Buckwheat honey is dark and strong, but is\r\nrelished by some, and when well ripened is good winter food for bees,\r\nso that whenever this plant can be made to blossom at a time when the\r\nbees find nothing better and a crop of grain can also be harvested from\r\nit, a plentiful supply should by all means be sown: the clovers, white,\r\nalsike, crimson, and mammoth or medium red may be sown for pasturage,\r\nhay, forage, for purposes of green manuring, or for seed, and honey of\r\nfine quality obtained if a sufficient number of blossoms are allowed to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Sacaline or giant knotweed (Polygonum\r\nsachalinense).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Russian or hairy vetch (Vicia villosa).]\r\n\r\nAlfalfa (_Medicago sativa_), a most important honey producer as well\r\nas perennial forage crop, can be grown over a much greater area of the\r\nUnited States than has heretofore been generally supposed. Sainfoin\r\n(_Onobrychis sativa_) and serradella (_Ornithopus sativus_), both most\r\nexcellent honey plants, have not received the attention they merit\r\neither North or South. Japan clover (_Lespedeza striata_) is grown\r\nprofitably in the South, and more even might be expected from the\r\nintroduction of sulla clover (_Hedysarum coronarium_) there, the latter\r\na great honey producer. Chicory, even on poor soil, is a good honey and\r\npollen plant. Northern bee keepers should try the dwarf (quick-growing)\r\nvarieties of cowpeas (_Vigna sinensis_) extensively grown in the\r\nSouth for forage and green manuring. Vetches are of recognized value\r\nfor the same purposes, especially the Russian hairy vetch (_Vicia\r\nvillosa_). Sacaline (_Polygonum sachalinense_) and flat peas (_Lathyrus\r\nsylvestris_) are visited by bees, and in certain situations may be\r\nfound of value otherwise. Peppermint (_Mentha piperita_) yields well in\r\nJuly and August. Parsnips (_Pastinaca sativa_) when grown for seed are\r\nassiduously visited by bees for honey during June. July, and August.\r\nGorse or furze (_Ulex europæus_) for forage may prove valuable in some\r\nlocalities here, as it is highly esteemed in some parts of Europe.\r\nIts odorous yellow blossoms, much frequented by bees, appear in May.\r\nFilbert bushes (_Corylus avellana_) will grow in many portions of our\r\ncountry, yielding, besides nuts, an abundance of early pollen, even in\r\nFebruary or March. The carob tree (_Ceratonia siliqua_) succeeds in the\r\nSouthwest, yielding a crop of economic value, besides a harvest in\r\nlate summer for bees. It is also a fine ornamental tree. There are no\r\nfiner shade or ornamental trees for the lawn or roadside than lindens\r\n(basswoods) and horse-chestnuts. To these chestnut, locust, sourwood,\r\nand tulip trees may be added. The timber of all is useful; and since\r\nthey are great honey yielders their propagation near the apiary is very\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nBees range ordinarily within 2 or 3 miles in all directions from their\r\nhomes, but sometimes go farther. Pasturage to be especially valuable,\r\nhowever, should be within 2 miles, and less than a mile distant to\r\nthe main source is quite preferable. The advantage is probably not so\r\nmuch in the saving of time in going back and forth, for bees fly with\r\ngreat rapidity, but because when sudden storms arise, especially those\r\naccompanied by high winds, the heavily laden bees are more likely to\r\nreach home safely and the hive will not be decimated of its gathering\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BEES AS CROSS-FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made in this bulletin to the importance of\r\nbees in the complete cross fertilization of fruit blossoms and to the\r\nfact that certain varieties of pears have been found to be completely\r\nself-sterile, requiring, therefore, pollen from other varieties before\r\nthey can develop perfect seeds and fruits. It is interesting to study\r\nthe ways in which cross fertilization of plants is secured through the\r\nvisits of insects. The part that bees perform in the development and\r\nperpetuation of numerous ornamental and economic plants is thereby\r\nclearly shown. Space will only permit the introduction here of one or\r\ntwo examples. The willow-herb, which is an abundant secreter of nectar\r\nand thus attracts bees freely, illustrates one feature in pollination\r\nby bees. A young blossom of this plant (fig. 44, A) shows the stamens\r\nmaturing and shedding their pollen, while the pistil remains curved\r\ndownward and with closed stigmas. In the older flower (fig. 44, B), the\r\nstamens having shed their pollen and begun to wither, the pistil has\r\nstraightened up and exposed its stigmatic surfaces for the reception\r\nof the pollen which a bee chancing to come from a younger blossom is\r\nlikely to bring. Self-pollination is thus positively prevented and\r\ncross fertilization is insured.\r\n\r\nIn the mountain laurel the anthers are held securely by little pockets\r\nin the corolla, so that as the flower opens the stamens are found bent\r\nover (fig. 50, B) ready to be liberated (fig. 50, C) by the visit of a\r\nbee. When the stamen flies up the pollen is discharged from the anther\r\nand dusted on the underside of the bee. The latter as it alights on the\r\nnext flower naturally touches the stigma first and rubs off some of the\r\npollen it has brought from the last flower visited. It then proceeds to\r\nsecure the nectar of the flower on which it has just alighted, and in\r\ndoing this liberates the stamens of this flower and gets dusted again\r\nwith pollen, which it carries to the next flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Mountain laurel (_Kalmia latifolia_).

(From Cheshire.)]\r\n\r\nThe cross section of an imperfectly developed apple shown herewith\r\n(fig. 51, B) illustrates the importance of complete fertilization of\r\nfruit blossoms. The seed vessel at u shows only an abortive seed,\r\nand the side of the fruit nearest this point is also correspondingly\r\nundeveloped. This is owing to imperfect or complete lack of\r\nfertilization of this carpel, five distinct fertilizations being\r\nnecessary to produce a perfect fruit. Bees being, during the period\r\nof fruit blossoms, the most abundant insects that might effect the\r\nnecessary distribution of the pollen of these flowers, the importance\r\nis at once seen of having an apiary in or near the orchard. Continued\r\nrainy or cold weather may keep the bees confined to their hives much of\r\nthe time during fruit bloom, hence it is advisable to have them near\r\nat hand and in numbers proportionate to the size of the orchards, so\r\nthat even a few hours of sunshine will assure their making a thorough\r\ndistribution of the pollen. In the absence of accurate experiments\r\nregarding the number of colonies of bees required to insure proper\r\nfertilization in the orchard, and also in view of the fact that\r\nsurrounding conditions vary greatly, it is difficult to say exactly how\r\nmany colonies are positively necessary for a given number of trees.\r\nHowever, four or five well-populated hives for every hundred large\r\napple trees will doubtless suffice, even though no other hive bees are\r\nwithin a mile of the orchard. The bees of a neighbor's apiary are often\r\nquite sufficient for the orchardist's purpose, the benefit resulting\r\nfrom their labors being, therefore, mutual, though the orchardist\r\ndoubtless derives in this case greater advantage from them than does\r\ntheir owner himself. Escaped swarms lodged in forest trees in the\r\nvicinity of the orchard are sometimes sufficiently numerous to perform\r\nthe work well. The great value of bees as cross fertilizers makes their\r\ndestruction a serious injury to the interests of the fruit grower.\r\nTherefore spraying with arsenicals during fruit bloom should never be\r\npracticed. The injurious insects can be reached quite as well before\r\nand after the blooming period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Heath-like wild aster (_Aster ericoides_).\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bul. 1, new series, Div. of Entomology, U.

Many plants are therefore omitted which secrete\r\nnectar freely but which are abundant only locally; others are left\r\nout because they secrete only at rare intervals, or under peculiar\r\nconditions, or are visited by bees only when some better honey source\r\nfails; others again because, though secreting well and readily yielding\r\ntheir honey or pollen stores to the bees, they are not often present\r\nin sufficient numbers in any one locality to enable the bees to add\r\nmaterially to their surplus stores. Such plants are, however, often of\r\ngreat value because they cause the bees to rear brood during intervals\r\nbetween the times of storing surplus honey and thus keep the colonies\r\npopulous for successive harvests.\r\n\r\nBesides the main honey plants it would be easy to name for any\r\nlocality quite a number of secondary importance which are frequented\r\nby honey bees, yet even though the localities were but a few miles\r\napart scarcely any two lists would agree either as to the plants to\r\nbe included or as to their relative importance. The following honey\r\nand pollen producing plants are therefore of wide distribution or of\r\nspecial importance in certain localities.\r\n\r\nFor convenience separate lists are given for the three sections of the\r\nUnited States made by the parallels of 35° and 40° N. The flora of the\r\nwestern portion of each section differs of course greatly from that of\r\nthe eastern part of the same section. Only the most important honey\r\nyielders among those of local interest in the extreme Southwest and\r\nthe West have been included in the lists, and the chief range of each\r\nhas been noted. An effort has been made to indicate by the type the\r\nrelative importance of the plants as pollen and honey producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTH AND NORTHEAST.\r\n\r\n                            [Above 40° N.]\r\n\r\n  Red or Soft Maple (_Acer rubrum_)                              April.\r\n  Alders (_Alnus_)                                               April.\r\n  Elm (_Ulmus_)                                                  April.\r\n  Willows (_Salix_)                                              Apr.-May.\r\n  _Dandelion_ (_Taraxacum taraxacum_ = _T. officinale_ of\r\n    Gray's Manual)                                               Apr.-May.\r\n  _Sugar_, _Rock_, or _Hard Maple_ (_Acer saccharum_ = _A.\r\n    saccharinum_ of Gray's Manual)                               Apr.-May.\r\n  _Juneberry_, or _Service Berry_ (_Amelanchier canadensis_)     May.\r\n  Wild Crab Apples (_Pyrus_)                                     May.\r\n  GOOSEBERRY and CURRANT (_Ribes_)                               May.\r\n  PEACH, CHERRY, and PLUM (_Prunus_)                             May.\r\n  PEAR and APPLE (_Pyrus_)                                       May.\r\n  Huckleberries and Blueberries (_Gaylussacia_ and _Vaccinium_)  May-June.\r\n  COMMON, BLACK, or YELLOW LOCUST (_Robinia pseudacacia_)        May-June.\r\n  European Horse-chestnut (_Æsculus hippocastanum_)              May-June.\r\n  Common Barberry (_Berberis vulgaris_)                          May-June.\r\n  TULIP TREE, or \"WHITEWOOD\" (_Liriodendron tulipifera_)         May-June.\r\n  Grapevines (_Vitis_)                                           May-June.\r\n  Rape (_Brassica napus_)                                        May-June.\r\n  _White Mustard_ and _Black Mustard_ (_Brassica alba_ and\r\n    _B. nigra_)                                                  June.\r\n  RASPBERRY (_Rubus_)                                            June.\r\n  WHITE CLOVER (_Trifolium repens_)                              June-July.\r\n  ALSIKE CLOVER (_Trifolium hybridum_)                           June-July.\r\n  Edible Chestnut (_Castanea dentata_ = _C. sativa_ var.\r\n    _americana_ of Gray's Manual)                                June-July.\r\n  ALFALFA, or LUCERN (_Medicago sativa_)                         June-July.\r\n  LINDEN, or BASSWOOD (_Tilia americana_)                        July.\r\n  Smooth Sumac (_Rhus glabra_)                                   July.\r\n  _Buttonbush_ (_Cephalanthus occidentalis_)                     July.\r\n  MELILOT, BOKHARA, or SWEET CLOVER (_Melilotus alba_)           July-Aug.\r\n  Indian Corn (Zea mags)                                         July-Aug.\r\n  Melon, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin (_Citrullus_, _Cucumis_,\r\n    and _Cucurbita_).

Merely lifting one edge of the\r\nquilt or, if the bottom board is a loose one, tipping the hive back so\r\nas to get a view in between the combs will often suffice. Should there\r\nnot be at least the equivalent of two full frames of honey it is best\r\nto supply the deficiency at once. Without disturbing the brood full\r\ncombs may be substituted at each side for the empty ones. If combs\r\nstored with honey and sealed over are not in reserve liquid honey or\r\nsugar sirup may be poured into empty ones and placed in the hives at\r\nnight. A less dauby plan is to use one or more feeders directly over\r\nthe brood nest, supplying several pounds of food at once. An excellent\r\nway is to give at one time all they need in the shape of a cake of bee\r\ncandy, made by mixing fine sugar with just enough honey to produce a\r\nstiff dough. This cake of candy should be wrapped in heavy paper (half\r\nparchment, or such as is used for wrapping butter is good) and laid on\r\ntop of the frames, after having punctured the paper in several places\r\nwith a pencil or sharp stick to give the bees ready access. Two or\r\nthree twigs or strips of wood laid across the frames before the cake is\r\nplaced on them will also give the bees a better opportunity to reach\r\nthe food.\r\n\r\nIf the food be given in small quantities brood rearing will be\r\nencouraged and still greater supplies of food will be called for,\r\nrendering it absolutely necessary to give a large amount at once or\r\ncontinue the feeding until natural sources fully supply the needs\r\nof the bees and brood, otherwise both may starve. Three pounds of\r\nsugar dissolved in one quart of water will make a suitable sirup for\r\nspring feeding. Dry sugar may be used instead of sirup. The bees will\r\nliquefy it themselves if they have access to water. For stimulative\r\npurposes honey; s better than sugar, \"strained honey\" being better than\r\nextracted. This is because of the greater amount of pollen which the\r\nstrained product contains, the pollen being highly nitrogenous, hence\r\ncapable of building up muscular tissue. But if the liquid honey is\r\none-half more in price per pound than sugar the latter would doubtless\r\nbe the more economical, certainly so if a plentiful supply of good\r\npollen in the combs or fresh from the fields can be had. Eye flour put\r\nin sunny places and sprinkled with honey to attract the bees will be\r\ncollected until new pollen comes.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather has become sufficiently settled to render safe the\r\ninspection of the brood combs, or, in general, when the bees fly the\r\ngreater part of each clear day, the work of the queen may be inspected.\r\nShould the comb having the largest area of brood in it be toward one\r\nside of the hive it is best to locate it as near the center as may\r\nbe, placing on either side successively those combs having smaller\r\ncircles of brood and on each side of these the combs containing no\r\nbrood, but well stored with pollen, while those having honey only\r\nwill come still outside of these. The brood nest will then have an\r\nopportunity to develop equally in all directions. Empty combs are of\r\nlittle use at this time outside of the brood nest as thus arranged,\r\nand should be replaced by combs of honey if the latter is needed, or\r\nremoved altogether. If the combs are well crowded with bees and the\r\nqueen shows by her regular and compact placing of the brood, as well\r\nas by the quantity she seems to have, that she is vigorous and thus\r\ncapable of accomplishing more than any ordinary brood nest will require\r\nof her at this time of the year, a frame filled with worker comb may\r\nbe slipped into the center of the brood nest. This will be taken\r\npossession of immediately by the bees, cleaned and warmed up, whereupon\r\nthe queen will soon have it filled with eggs. From time to time other\r\ncombs may be added in the same manner. If cautiously and judiciously\r\nfollowed this plan, supplemented by liberal stores, will increase the\r\nbrood area and eventually the population of the hive. But the utmost\r\ncaution is needed, for if done too early cool weather may cause the\r\nbees to cluster more closely and result in the chilling of some part\r\nof the brood which has thus been spread. The very object sought is not\r\nonly missed, but the loss of brood will prove a serious setback to\r\nthe colony. The escape of any of the warmth generated by the bees, as\r\nalso sudden changes in the weather, should be guarded against. Warm\r\ncovering above and outer protection are therefore absolute necessities\r\nif the best results are to be attained. With favorable weather for the\r\ndevelopment of brood it is certain that stimulative feeding, if made\r\nnecessary by the fact that the natural honey resources of the country\r\nwill not alone bring the strength of the colony fairly up to the\r\ndesired standard by the opening of the harvest, is to be begun six to\r\nseven weeks before the opening of the honey flow from which surplus is\r\nto be expected.\r\n\r\nIf, however, this honey flow comes so early that it is likely to be\r\npreceded by weather unfavorable to the development of brood, it will be\r\nnecessary to allow for this by beginning the stimulation even earlier,\r\nso that it may be done more gradually, and the greatest care will have\r\nto be taken to retain all the heat of the brood nest. Should the main\r\nflow be preceded by a lighter one, especially if the latter comes some\r\nweeks before the chief harvest, it may be important to watch the brood\r\nnest closely lest it becomes clogged with honey to the exclusion of\r\nbrood, inclining the bees not to enter surplus receptacles placed above\r\nand causing the colony to be weak in numbers later in the season. This\r\nstate of affairs can be easily avoided by the timely use of the honey\r\nextractor, since the brood combs, emptied of the honey which the\r\nworkers in an emergency have stored wherever they found vacant cells,\r\nare made available for the queen. Before the main harvest opens it may\r\neven be necessary in order to keep the combs filled with brood to feed\r\nback gradually this extracted honey or its equivalent; but by taking\r\nit away and returning it gradually the object sought will have been\r\naccomplished, namely, keeping the combs stocked with brood until the\r\nharvest is well under way, or as long as the larger population thus\r\ngained in the hive can be made available.\r\n\r\nIt is in this getting workers ready for the early harvest--hives over\r\nflowing, as it were, with bees--that the skill of the apiarist is taxed\r\nto its utmost. The work properly begins with the close of the summer\r\npreceding the harvest, for the first steps toward successful wintering\r\nshould be taken then, and unless wintered successfully the colony can\r\nnot be put in shape to take full advantage of an early honey harvest.\r\n\r\nGood judgment in the application of the hints given in this chapter,\r\nwith careful and frequent attention, will bring colonies to the chief\r\nspring or early summer flow of honey in good condition, with plenty\r\nof bees and with combs well stocked with brood, provided they have\r\nwintered well and have good queens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TRANSFERRING.\r\n\r\nIf colonies have been purchased in box hives, it is advisable at the\r\nfirst favorable opportunity to get them into frame hives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Transferring--drumming the bees from a box\r\nhive into a frame hire. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nEarly in the season--that is, in April or May in middle latitudes,\r\nbefore the brood nest has reached its greatest extension and while the\r\nhive contains the least honey--it is not a difficult matter to drive\r\nthe bees from their combs, cut out the latter, and fit them into\r\nframes. If the combs thus fitted in are held temporarily in place in\r\nthe frames, the bees, under whose care they should be placed at once,\r\nwill fasten them securely in a few hours or days at most. To drive\r\nthe bees from the box hive proceed as follows: Toward the middle of\r\na pleasant day blow smoke into the hive to be transferred, and after\r\nthe bees have been given a few minutes in which to lap up their fill\r\nof honey, invert the hive and place over the open end an empty box,\r\nor the frame hive itself, making whichever is used fit closely on\r\nthe hive (fig. 53). By rapping continuously for some minutes on the\r\nhive the bees will be impelled to leave it and cluster in the upper\r\nbox. A loud humming will denote that they are moving. The hive thus\r\nvacated may then be taken into a closed room and one side pried off to\r\nfacilitate the removal of the combs. The box containing the bees is to\r\nbe placed meanwhile on the spot originally occupied by the box hive,\r\nthe bees being allowed to go in and out without restraint, only two\r\nprecautions being necessary, namely, to shade the box well and provide\r\nfor ventilation by propping it up from the bottom, leaving also, if\r\npossible, an opening at the top. When the combs have been fitted into\r\nframes, the hive containing them is placed on the original stand and\r\nthe bees shaken from the box in front of it.\r\n\r\nIn filling the frames with combs cut from a box hive, the largest and\r\nstraightest sheets having the most sealed worker brood in them should\r\nbe selected first and so cut that the frame will slip over them snugly,\r\ntaking pains, as far as possible, to have the comb placed in the frame\r\nin the same position in which it was built, since most of the cells,\r\ninstead of being horizontal, are inclined upward, the inclination of\r\nthe deeper store cells being greatest. The comb, if not heavy, can be\r\nheld in place temporarily by slender wire nails pushed through holes\r\npunched in the side and top bars. Before the introduction of wire\r\nnails the writer used long thorns pulled from thorn-apple trees, which\r\nserved the purpose very well. In the case of combs heavy with honey\r\nor brood or pieced more or less it will be safer to use, in addition\r\nto a few wire nails, a pair or two of transferring sticks. These are\r\nsimply slender strips of wood slightly longer than the depth of the\r\nframe and notched at each end. By placing such a stick on either side\r\nof the comb and winding annealed wire around the top and bottom ends\r\nso as to draw the sticks firmly against the surface of the combs the\r\nlatter will be held securely in the frames. The midrib between the rows\r\nof cells should be pressed neither to one side nor the other; thus,\r\nif cells on one side are deeper than those on the other, they should\r\nbe shaved down, unless the honey will be cut into too much, in which\r\ncase the comb maybe allowed to project on one side until it has been\r\nfastened in the frame and the hive has been generally put in order by\r\nthe bees, the point being not to force them to try to manage too much\r\nrunning honey at one time, lest robbing be induced. In many instances\r\nthe comb when pressed into the frame will seem to be so firm as not to\r\nneed nails or sticks, but in the heat of the hive, and with the weight\r\nof the bees that will cluster on it to repair the cut edges and fasten\r\nthem to the bars of the frame, unsupported combs are very apt to give\r\nway, creating disastrous confusion. Thus the sticks, nails, or their\r\nequivalent should always be used (fig. 54). All frames should be filled\r\nwith perfectly straight combs so as to be interchangeable. With care in\r\nfitting in and some trimming and pressing into shape afterwards, fully\r\nthree-fourths of the worker combs cut from box hives can be made into\r\ngood, serviceable combs in frame hives. The process is much facilitated\r\nif such combs are used in the extractor during the first season or two\r\nafter transferring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Transferred comb and inserted queen cell.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nShould the time be near the swarming season the combs will be so filled\r\nwith brood and honey that the task will be much greater, and the\r\ntransfer should be postponed until three weeks after the first swarm\r\nissues. The brood left by the old queen will have matured and issued\r\nfrom the cells by that time, and the young queen, if no accident has\r\nhappened to her, will have begun laying; yet there will usually be only\r\neggs, with perhaps a few very young larvæ, present in the combs at this\r\ntime, so that the cutting out and fitting of the latter into frames\r\nwill not be as troublesome nor attended with so much waste as just\r\nbefore the swarm issued.\r\n\r\nStill another plan--one which it would not be best to employ before\r\nfairly warm weather has set in, but which will render the work of\r\ntransferring the lightest--is to turn the box hive bottom upward and\r\nplace on it the brood apartment of a frame hive, having in it frames\r\nfilled with worker combs or with comb foundation, arranging at the same\r\ntime to give the bees ready access from their combs to those above and\r\nno entrance to their hive except through the frame hive above. This can\r\neasily be done by making a temporary bottom board for the frame hive,\r\nwith several holes through it, or with one large one about the size of\r\nthe open end of the box hive. As soon as it is perceived that the queen\r\nhas taken possession of the new combs--as she will be almost certain\r\nto do, especially if one of the combs placed above contains some\r\nbrood--a piece of queen-excluding zinc placed over the opening between\r\nthe two hives will keep her above, and three weeks later, when all the\r\nbrood in the combs below has matured, the box hive may be removed and\r\nthe combs transferred to frames, if worth using in this way; but if\r\nold or composed of drone cells or very irregular in shape these combs\r\nmay be rendered into wax, after extracting any honey that may happen\r\nto be in them. Inverting the box hive will generally cause the bees\r\nto remove what honey they have stored in the combs. This honey will\r\nbe utilized in building out the foundation placed in the added story,\r\nor, having these combs completed, the bees will store in them whatever\r\nremains. Should the queen fail to enter the superposed hive, the plan\r\nmay be adopted of driving her with her workers into the added story, as\r\ndescribed on page 72. When the lower combs have been nearly deserted it\r\nwill be safe to assume that the queen has gone into the upper hive with\r\nthe main force of workers, and the excluder zinc may be inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUEENLESSNESS IN SPRING.\r\n\r\nThe loss of a queen during winter or early spring can generally be\r\ndiscovered by noticing just at nightfall, after the first or second\r\ngeneral flight, which colonies are restless and continue to buzz\r\nexcitedly when the others are humming in a contented manner or have\r\nquieted down for the night. The workers of the queenless colony run in\r\nand out excitedly, searching over the front of the hive. Should it be\r\nopened they will not resent the intrusion, but, remaining on the combs,\r\nwill at once set up a loud and prolonged buzzing. These symptoms become\r\nless pronounced from day to day. If a comb containing brood be inserted\r\nduring this period it will be hailed with evident delight, manifested\r\nby the eager crowding of the bees from all sides toward it. A contented\r\nhum replaces the sound of mourning, and if young worker-larvæ are\r\npresent preparations, as described on pages 88-89, are begun at once\r\nto rear a queen. However, if much reduced in numbers the colony should\r\nbe joined to one with a queen, or several queenless ones united. The\r\nlatter may be smoked and simply shaken or brushed together. But bees\r\nthat have been queenless long when added to those that have not yet\r\nmissed their own queen will frequently be killed at once. The queen\r\nshould therefore be taken from her own bees and caged for thirty-six to\r\nforty-eight hours in the hive which has previously been queenless, and\r\nher own bees added when she is released. (See page 94.) A board leaned\r\nagainst the front of the hive will cause the bees to note their change\r\nin location when they fly out and they will then easily find their new\r\nquarters when returning from their flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                   =SECURING SURPLUS HONEY AND WAX.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the colonies of bees have been brought to the opening of a given\r\nhoney flow with a powerful population recently hatched it will require\r\nno great skill to secure a good crop, granted, of course, that the\r\nflowers actually do secrete the nectar. In the ordinary course of\r\nevents some colonies are likely to come through to the early harvest\r\nin good shape, but if all those contained in a large apiary are in\r\nprime order at this time it is good evidence of skill on the part of\r\nthe attendant, this even though the weather and other circumstances\r\nmay have favored his work. To secure a yield of surplus honey the part\r\nremaining to be done, if all goes well, is merely to put the surplus\r\nreceptacles in place, admit the bees, and remove the combs when filled\r\nand sealed. But if swarming complications arise the whole of the bee\r\nkeeper's skill and ingenuity may again be called into requisition to\r\nkeep the forces together and storing in the surplus receptacles. Should\r\nthe expected harvest not come--that is, should the flowers from which\r\nthe yield is anticipated not secrete honey, or should they bloom when\r\nthe weather would not permit the bees to fly--of course no amount of\r\nskill could make up the deficiency. In such a case all that can be\r\ndone is to carry the colonies through to the next honey yield in good\r\nshape--to keep up (by feeding if necessary) the populousness of the\r\ncolonies. The flow may begin suddenly or before it is looked for; it\r\nmay be excellent for only a very short time, a day or two even, and be\r\ncut off short in the midst of its greatest abundance. Thus the skill\r\nlies in having the colonies ready for whatever may come and a force\r\nsufficient to store the whole season's surplus in a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EXTRACTED HONEY.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points in securing extracted honey is to\r\nhave a large stock of surplus combs. These, with the strong colonies\r\nof bees to utilize them, and the honey extractor, are the great\r\nrequisites of the producer of extracted honey. As fast as the bees\r\ncan cover and utilize them, these combs are added to the colonies,\r\none or two at a time from the opening of the season until the brood\r\napartment is full. As soon as more combs than the lower story will\r\nhold are needed a second story filled with combs may be added, or but\r\ntwo or three may be placed in it at one side with a division board\r\nnext to them. It is a good plan to sort over the combs of the brood\r\napartment, removing several of the less regular ones, or if all are\r\nalike as regards regularity and in having worker cells only, but some\r\ncontain considerable honey and little brood, these are to be removed\r\nand the empty space filled in with good worker combs. The removed\r\ncombs should be placed in the top story, which, if the weather and\r\nthe strength of the colony permit, is to be filled out with combs at\r\nonce. The strongest colonies will, of course, begin work first, and\r\ncan often spare partly filled combs to be placed in the top stories\r\nof less populous colonies, thus encouraging the latter to begin work\r\nin the upper stories. It is safe to say that in general more than\r\ntwice the yield of honey can be obtained from colonies supplied during\r\nthe whole honey flow, with all the completed combs they are able to\r\nutilize, than can be expected from colonies that have to build all of\r\nthe combs for their surplus while storing. Completed combs not being\r\navailable, comb foundation in full sheets should be employed. During\r\nthe early part of the harvest this will be drawn out very quickly and\r\naid greatly in securing the honey which otherwise might be lost for\r\nwant of store combs as fast as might be needed. During a fair yield the\r\nfoundation will pay for itself the first season in the extra amount\r\nof honey, and the combs, properly cared for, can be used year after\r\nyear--indefinitely, in fact--for extracting. The best of them should be\r\npicked out constantly to replace less desirable ones that may be found\r\nin the brood apartment, or to give to new swarms destined to produce\r\nextracted honey. Some prefer for the surplus cases frames half the\r\ndepth of ordinary brood frames, finding them easier to manipulate.\r\n\r\nWhenever the combs of a top story are nearly filled, and before they\r\nare completely sealed, it may be lifted up and another story, filled\r\nwith empty combs, placed between it and the brood apartment, and this\r\nmay be continued until the end of the honey flow, and all may be left\r\non the hive during the warm weather. It would, of course, be easier\r\nto add the new stories successively at the top--that is, above the\r\npartially filled surplus stories--and this plan works well as long as\r\nthe honey flow is abundant, but when put on just as the yield slackens,\r\neven if but little, or when the weather is cool, the bees may refuse to\r\nbegin work in the new super unless it is placed between the partially\r\nfilled ones and the brood apartment. Leaving the filled top stories\r\non the hives for some time permits the more complete evaporation of\r\nthe moisture contained in the newly gathered honey, and by marking\r\nthe stories the honey from a certain source, when the yield has been\r\nsufficient to get the combs filled and sealed, can be extracted by\r\nitself. If the supply of combs is insufficient to hold the whole\r\namount gathered, it must then be extracted as fast as sealed, lest the\r\nbees, lacking ready cells in which to deposit their surplus as fast\r\nas gathered, hang idly about, or if space for new combs exists, only\r\nslowly provide these, losing meanwhile much of the harvest. When sealed\r\nthe honey will generally be found fairly ripened, though it may improve\r\nby being stored in open buckets or cans in a dry, warm room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Uncapping and extracting honey. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe process of extracting is extremely simple, and a little practice\r\nwill enable an observing person to do it well (fig. 55). As indicated\r\nabove, some judgment is required in the selection of combs, regard\r\nbeing had to the future condition of the colony. The filled comb-, as\r\nfast as removed, are placed in a light case the size of a hive, or a\r\ntin can made specially for the purpose, covered closely to prevent the\r\naccess of robbers, and taken to the extracting room, which should be\r\nbee-proof. It is not always necessary to use such care in excluding all\r\nbees, but the novice should practice it until he learns to distinguish\r\nby the actions of the bees when such precautions may be dispensed\r\nwith. Whenever possible the stories containing surplus honey should\r\nbe lifted up and honey boards containing bee escapes slipped between\r\nthem and the brood apartment early in the morning of the day before\r\nthe extracting is to be done, in case the bees are still gathering,\r\notherwise the night before will do. The combs will then be free from\r\nbees, or nearly so, when the operator wishes to remove them, and will\r\ncontain no honey gathered within twenty-four hours, the last day's\r\ngathering having also been ripened considerably during the night\r\npreceding the insertion of the escapes. When the queen has not been\r\nrestricted in her laying to the lower story by means of excluders,\r\nthis plan of freeing the combs of bees will fail in case the escapes\r\nare placed on lower stories above which the brood and the queen may\r\nbe. The only way then will be to remove the combs one by one, after\r\nsmoking the bees to quiet them, and shake or brush off the latter into\r\nthe top story. Italians can not be shaken off unless their bodies are\r\npretty well filled with honey, but they may be safely brushed off after\r\nsmoking. For this a single large feather from the left wing of a turkey\r\nis best. Other races can be shaken off after smoking. Eastern bees\r\nshould never be brushed from the combs when extracting, nor at any time\r\nunless they are gorged with honey. They can all be shaken off easily,\r\nand will need less smoke than the European races.\r\n\r\nWhen much extracting is to be done, top stories of hives or light\r\ncases with cloth covers, weighted with a rod sewed into the loose\r\nedge, may be used to hold the full combs as fast as taken from the\r\nhives, and these, placed on a wheelbarrow, cart, or car, can be easily\r\ntransported to the extracting room. The uncapping knife, kept in hot\r\nwater when not in use, is passed rapidly under the capping of the\r\nsealed combs, the point of it being used to reach depressed surfaces.\r\nThe loosened cappings drop into a sieve resting over a pan, or into\r\nthe upper part of a can specially designed to receive cappings. The\r\nsmall amount of honey removed with the cappings drains through the\r\nstrainer and is drawn off below. The uncapped combs are placed in\r\nthe extractor at once. As the cells generally slant upward more or\r\nless, especially those built for store cells outside the brood nest,\r\nthe throwing out of the honey is facilitated by placing each comb in\r\nsuch a manner as to bring the top bar at the right hand, the basket\r\nbeing revolved in the most natural way--that is, from right to left.\r\nA little practice will enable the operator to note the speed required\r\nin order to free the combs entirely from honey, which will depend, of\r\ncourse, upon the consistency of the honey and the length of time combs\r\nare revolved. While it is, in general, best to avoid extracting from\r\ncombs containing brood, cases will arise where it is necessary. If the\r\nbrood is sealed, there will, be less liability of injuring it than\r\nwhen open cells containing larvæ are placed in the extractor; but a\r\nmoderate degree of speed continued somewhat longer will usually bring\r\nthe honey out without disturbance to the immature bees. Three persons\r\ncan work together very advantageously--one to remove the surplus cases\r\nor combs from the hives, free them of their bees, and bring them into\r\nthe extracting room, where two assistants uncap and extract the honey.\r\nIf the bees are not gathering honey and are therefore prone to rob,\r\nthe person who removes the combs from the hives should be assisted by\r\nan active boy who can cover hives or cases quickly or lift the latter\r\nwhen necessary. The combs when emptied may be returned at once to the\r\nhives if the bees are still engaged in storing. The slight damage which\r\nthey have sustained under the uncapping knife or in the extractor will\r\nsoon be repaired; indeed, with a little experience the uncappers will\r\nbe able to smooth and trim irregular combs in such a way as to render\r\nthem straighter after they have been through the extractor. It is\r\nparticularly desirable, in order to straighten the combs of transferred\r\ncolonies and get them in good working trim, that they be run for\r\nextracted honey during the first year or two; moreover, a good yield of\r\nextracted honey is more likely to be obtained from recently transferred\r\ncolonies than comb honey, especially if the manipulators are beginners\r\nin the work.\r\n\r\nWhen the extracting is done after the close of the gathering period,\r\nthe greatest care should be taken not to start robbing. The surplus\r\ncombs should be returned to the hives just before nightfall, and not\r\neven a taste of sweets of any kind should be left exposed. The object\r\nin returning the combs is to have them cleaned up, and also to have\r\nthem under the protection of the bees until cool weather puts a stop\r\nto the destructive work of wax-moth larvæ. When sharp frosts occur,\r\nthe surplus combs may be removed from the hives and placed in a dry,\r\ncold room. An open loft (if not infested with mice or if the combs are\r\nprotected from the latter) is a good place, and it is much better to\r\nplace the combs so they do not touch each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMB HONEY.\r\n\r\nThe general directions given in the preceding chapter on spring\r\nmanipulation to secure populous colonies apply as well to those\r\ndesigned for comb honey as to those which are to produce extracted\r\nhoney. If any difference is to be observed it is even more important\r\nthat the former be brought to the opening of the honey flow with the\r\nbrood combs compactly filled with developing bees to the exclusion\r\nof honey, than that the latter should be so; and colonies not strong\r\nenough to enter sections readily, if at all, may still be utilized, and\r\noften do fairly well in the production of extracted honey.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned surplus boxes holding 25 to 30 pounds are regarded\r\nquite as relics of the past by those who use frame hives and produce\r\ncomb honey in fine marketable shape, and even if for home consumption\r\nthe pound (fig. 50) and 12-pound sections are always preferred, since\r\nthey are so cheap, permit the use of comb foundation, and are in neat\r\nshape and of convenient size for the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--One-piece V-grooved section. (From Gleanings.)]\r\n\r\nSection holders (fig. 57) with sections folded and in place, each\r\nsection supplied with thin foundation, preferably full sheets, but at\r\nleast guides, should be in readiness before the opening of the harvest.\r\nForty to fifty sections for each hive should be prepared. One-piece\r\nsections, if bought in the flat, should be placed in the cellar for two\r\nor three days before folding. If the section back of the V-joints is\r\nthen moistened slightly they can be set up rapidly without breakage.\r\nSections made of white poplar are by far the neatest looking and do\r\nnot cost much if any more than basswood, so that bee keepers might\r\nshow their disapproval of the wholesale destruction of our basswood or\r\nlinden timber by resolutely refusing to buy sections made of that wood.\r\nThe four-piece sections, if well made, are preferable to the one-piece.\r\nThe latter do not keep their shape as firmly as the four-piece\r\nsections, which are made with lock joints at all the corners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Super with sections and section holders in\r\nplace: A, super; D, separator; E, sections; F, follower; G, wedge.\r\n(From Gleanings.)]\r\n\r\nThe foundation for sections should be the quality known as \"thin\r\nsurplus\" or, preferably, if full sheets be used, \"extra-thin surplus.\"\r\nThese grades are made of selected, light-colored wax, and 1 pound\r\nfurnishes full sheets for 100 to 125 standard sections (4¼ by 4¼\r\ninches). The sheets should be cut no larger than 3¾ inches square.\r\nThese will take up about three-sixteenths of an inch in fastening,\r\nwhich will leave nearly one-half inch space between the lower edge and\r\nthe bottom piece of the section and allow the foundation to stretch\r\nwhile being drawn out. This is necessary, otherwise the partially\r\ncompleted comb will bulge as soon as it reaches the bottom of the\r\nsection. In cutting foundation either for sections or frames one\r\nedge--the one to be attached--should be perfectly straight. To secure\r\nthis not more than six to ten sheets (depending on their thickness)\r\nshould be laid in one pile, and a sharp, thin-bladed knife, as well\r\nas a straight rule, used. Two or three piles may be laid side by\r\nside and with a rule long enough to reach across them all a dozen to\r\nthirty sheets can be cut at a time. Dipping the knife in warm water\r\nfacilitates the work.\r\n\r\nThe sheets are fastened in the section by the use of one of the\r\nmachines mentioned on page 52. They secure the wax to the wood by\r\npressure combined in some instances with heat. Fig. 40 shows one of\r\nthese. The simplest form consists merely of a sliding lever hinged to\r\na block. It is intended to be fastened by means of screws to a table\r\nor bench, and is then ready for use when the lever is moistened with\r\nhoney, starch water, or soapsuds along the edge which is to touch the\r\nwax sheets. The foundation is laid flat on the top piece of the section\r\nin such a way that the straight edge passes the center line one-eighth\r\nof an inch, and the whole is then slipped under the lever. The latter\r\nis brought down with a sliding motion toward the operator and at the\r\nsame time the foundation is bent up at right angles to the top piece.\r\nIf the wax is slightly soft it will adhere firmly. A heated brick\r\nplaced before the pile of starters will keep the edges soft enough if\r\nthe work is done in a moderately warm room.\r\n\r\nStarters half to three-fourths inch in width are sometimes used at the\r\nbottoms of sections to secure firm attachment of combs there. Bees\r\nincline to gnaw these bottom starters away unless the top pieces of\r\nfoundation reach within one-half inch of them. Top starters an inch or\r\nless in width may be used alone as comb guides when it is desirable to\r\navoid great outlay for foundation.\r\n\r\nThe use of strips of tin or wood as separators (fig. 57, D) between the\r\nsections insures straight combs with smooth surfaces, thus convenient\r\nto handle and ship.\r\n\r\nThe sections furnished with starters or full sheets of foundation are\r\nslipped with separators into supers and piled away ready for use as\r\nsoon as the harvest opens.\r\n\r\n                         PUTTING ON SECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIt is better not to put surplus honey receptacles on the hive until the\r\nhoney flow actually begins, as, of course, no work will be done in them\r\nuntil then. Moreover, all the heat is needed in the brood apartment\r\nduring the early part of the season. The bees might also become\r\ndiscouraged by the large amount of empty space and might not begin work\r\nin it at all before swarming. The sections would also be soiled by the\r\nbees crawling over them and daubing them with propolis.\r\n\r\nThe bee keeper who is familiar with the honey-producing flora of his\r\nlocality will note the development of the flower buds of any plant\r\nfrom which he expects a crop and will be able to judge accurately by\r\na glance at the colony when sections are needed. The beginner will do\r\nwell to consult carefully the list of honey-producing plants given in\r\nthe chapter on \"Bee pasturage,\" and also endeavor by inquiry in his\r\nneighborhood to ascertain what other sources, if any, are within the\r\nreach of his bees. The usual time of blooming of all principal honey\r\nplants should be noted, and the management to secure populous colonies\r\nhaving been in accordance with the directions given in Chapter VII on\r\n\"Spring manipulation,\" the opening of the first blossoms of any one of\r\nthe important honey yielders should be the signal for placing supers\r\nwith sections on all hives intended for comb honey production. Should\r\nthese indications not be sufficient, there is still another which\r\nno one could mistake. It is to examine the tops of the brood combs\r\nfrom time to time and note when the store cells between the brood and\r\nthe top bar are being made deeper by added wax. The fresh, whitened\r\nappearance which such combs present when viewed from above readily\r\ndistinguishes them from the yellow or dark combs wholly built during\r\nprevious seasons. The lower edges of partially completed combs will\r\nalso show additions at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Dadant-Quinby form of Langstroth hive,\r\nelevated from bottom board and slid back for ventilation in summer.\r\n(Redrawn from Langstroth.)]\r\n\r\nIt having been determined that the time to put on sections has arrived,\r\nthe quilt used over the frames is removed and the super, with section\r\nholders, sections, and separators in place, is set over the frames. A\r\nclean enameled or carriage-cloth quilt should be laid over the tops\r\nof the sections, if these are open above, and this weighted down\r\nwith a board which has been clamped to prevent warping. At this time\r\nthe flight hole should be full width and the hive protected from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun during the hotter portions of the day. With\r\nsmall, single-walled hives, such as hold eight combs or less, it may be\r\nnecessary, if the hives are crowded with bees, to raise them slightly\r\nfrom the bottom board or slide them back, so as to give small openings\r\nat the rear. Mr. Simmins's plan of placing below the brood nest a hive\r\nchamber with starters only in the frames permits the bees to avoid\r\nclustering too compactly and yet to keep up their work inside during\r\nextremely hot weather. Ventilation and shading of hives assist greatly\r\ntoward the prevention of swarming, and having bred the colony up until\r\nit is sufficiently strong to take advantage of the harvest, and having\r\nreached the opening of that harvest, it is desirable by all means to\r\nkeep the forces together as long as the flow lasts. (Fig. 58.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Langstroth hive with combined surplus case and\r\nshipping crate. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe supers should be removed as fast as fairly filled. The bees are\r\nslow in sealing over the outside sections; therefore it is better not\r\nto lose time waiting for these to be completely capped, but replace\r\nthe whole with a new set. Some prefer to lift up the super when about\r\nthree-fourths completed and place the empty one below--that is, between\r\nit and the brood chamber. The objection to this plan is that by the\r\ntime the sections placed above have been fully completed they will have\r\nmore or less propolis daubed on them and the combs will be considerably\r\nsoiled by the bees running over them. A better plan to secure the\r\ncompletion of the outside sections is, after removing a number of\r\nsupers, to select enough incomplete Sections to fill one super, Which\r\nis then placed on a strong colony for completion, or the partly filled\r\nsections may be used in the middle of new supers as bait sections to\r\ninduce the bees to cluster and begin work in them at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Honey shipping-cases. (From Gleanings.)]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such precautions for the prevention of swarming\r\nas shading the hives, ventilation, having only young queens, and\r\nthe removal of the outside combs, substituting for them frames of\r\nfoundations or starters near the center of the brood nest, swarms\r\nwill sometimes issue, especially from hives devoted to comb-honey\r\nproduction. The best plan in this case is to hive the swarm in a clean\r\nnew hive whose frames have been filled with starters and place this on\r\nthe stand of the parent colony, moving the latter to a new position\r\nor more feet away. The swarm in its new quarters will then be joined\r\nby the rest of the field workers from the parent hive, and the whole\r\ntone, reunited and having for some days no brood to care for, will\r\nconstitute a strong colony for storing honey. The super of partly\r\nfinished sections should be lifted, bees and all, from the parent hive\r\nand placed on the brood chamber of the new colony.\r\n\r\nThe supers should be promptly removed at the close of the honey\r\nharvest, honey boards with bee escapes in them being used to free\r\nthem from bees, as described under the head of \"Extracting.\" If the\r\ngathering season for the year has also ended, an examination of\r\nthe brood apartment should be made to determine whether feeding is\r\nnecessary, either to prolong brood rearing or for winter stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRODUCTION OF WAX.\r\n\r\nThe progressive apiarist of the present time does not look upon the\r\nproduction of wax in so great a proportion compared with his honey\r\nyield as did the old-time box-hive bee keeper. The latter obtained much\r\nof his honey for the market by crushing the combs and straining it out,\r\nleaving the crushed combs to be melted up for their wax. Before the\r\nuse of supers late swarms and many colonies quite heavy in honey were\r\nsmothered by the use of sulphur; the light ones because their honey\r\nsupply would not bring them through the winter, and the very heavy\r\nones because of the rich yield in honey. Frequent losses of bees in\r\nwintering and through queenlessness gave more combs for melting, as\r\nwithout frame hives; honey extractors, or comb-foundation machines, the\r\nvacated combs were not often utilized again. The wax from the pressed\r\ncombs was all marketed, since there could be but little home use for it.\r\n\r\nThe bee keeper of to-day, after having removed the honey from the\r\ncombs by centrifugal force, returns them, but slightly injured, to be\r\nrefilled by the bees, and at the end of the season these combs are\r\nstored away for use in successive years, or he secures the surplus,\r\nalso apart from the brood, in neat sectional boxes, to be marketed as\r\nstored--that is, without cutting.\r\n\r\nThe wax must therefore come from the cappings of combs where extracted\r\nhoney is produced, from occasional broken comb, bits of drone comb\r\nthat are cut out to be replaced by worker comb, from unfinished and\r\ntravel-stained sections from which the honey has been extracted, or\r\nfrom old brood combs that need to be replaced. Since the price per\r\npound of extracted honey is usually not less than one-third and that\r\nof comb honey one-half the price of wax, and it has already been\r\nindicated (p. 28) that some 12 to 15 pounds of honey may in general be\r\nsafely reckoned as necessary to produce 1 pound of comb, it can readily\r\nbe seen that it is much more profitable to turn the working force,\r\nin so far as possible, to the production of honey rather than wax,\r\ntaking only as much wax as can be produced without lowering the yield\r\nof honey; and what wax is taken is practically turned into honey the\r\nfollowing year, for it is made into comb foundation, which, judiciously\r\nused, increases in turn the season's yield of honey.\r\n\r\nWax being so much more valuable than honey, it behooves the bee keeper\r\nto save even the smallest pieces of comb; but during warm weather they\r\nmust not be left long or they will serve as breeding places for the\r\nwax moth, unless fumigated with burning sulphur or exposed to the fumes\r\nof bisulphide of carbon two or three times each month until no more\r\neggs of the moth remain.\r\n\r\nThe old way of rendering wax was to put the combs into a sack made of\r\nsome open stuff', weight this down in a kettle of water, and boil for\r\nsome time. The wax rose, and when cold was removed in a cake. This\r\nprocess, besides being dauby, often yielded inferior wax--burned,\r\nwater-soaked, or filled with settlings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--The Boardman solar wax extractor. (From\r\nGleanings.)]\r\n\r\nThe most approved method of rendering wax is, for moderate-sized\r\napiaries at least, by means of the solar wax extractor (fig. 61),\r\nalready mentioned under the head of \"Implements.\" Its management is\r\nvery simple. The machine is placed in the sunniest spot in or near the\r\napiary, and all of the wax cappings, after having been drained of honey\r\nor worked over by the bees, as well as bits of comb, are thrown into\r\nthe receiver above the wire strainer, the glass is adjusted, and the\r\nwhole is turned so that the direct rays of the sun enter. More bits\r\nof comb are added from time to time during the day. The melted wax\r\ntrickles through the strainer and collects in a tin placed at the lower\r\nedge of the tank or melter. The cake is removed each morning, it having\r\ncooled and contracted during the night sufficiently to cause the mass\r\nto cleave readily from the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe solar wax extractor can be used during four or five months of the\r\nyear in the more northern States, and for a longer time in the South.\r\nTo render wax at other times steam heat is best. When available a jet\r\nfrom a boiler may be connected with a barrel or vessel containing the\r\ncombs and a large amount rendered in a short time. In smaller apiaries\r\na steam extractor for use over a boiler on the stove may be employed\r\n(fig. 30). The manner of using these extractors is simple. The cappings\r\nand bits of comb to be rendered are placed in an inside basket made of\r\nperforated metal. Upon placing this over a water boiler, into which it\r\ntits closely, the steam rises through holes in the bottom of the upper\r\ncan and readily penetrates the mass. The melted wax runs out through a\r\nspout at the lower edge of the upper can and is caught in a pan partly\r\nfilled with warm water. As fast as the mass in the perforated can\r\nsettles away more bits of comb are added. The dark residue remaining\r\nis composed of cocoons, pollen, and accidental impurities. These\r\nmay, however, contain considerable wax which they have absorbed as it\r\nmelted. This waste may be avoided in a great measure if the combs are\r\nbroken up and soaked in rain water for twenty-four hours before melting.\r\n\r\nCakes of wax, if designed for the comb-foundation manufacturer, will\r\nbe acceptable just as they come from the wax extractor, but if for the\r\ngeneral market they should all be remelted in order to purify them.\r\nThis must be done with care or the wax will be seriously injured.\r\nIron vessels will discolor it, and as well or spring water frequently\r\ncontains iron, the use of rain water, whenever it is to come in contact\r\nwith the melted wax, will be found more desirable. It is best to\r\nmelt the wax slowly, for if heated too rapidly the particles become\r\ndisaggregated and take up a certain quantity of water, the mass loses\r\nits luster, and becomes pale and granular. In this condition its market\r\nvalue is low. Remelting slowly, especially in a solar wax extractor,\r\nwill restore it.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties in purifying wax may be avoided if it is melted in\r\na tin or copper vessel and in a water bath, that is, the melter is to\r\nstand within a larger vessel containing sufficient water to surround\r\nthe former. As much wax as possible should be melted at one time, and\r\nwhen convenient the inner can is left standing in the water, so that\r\nthe wax remains liquid some time, permitting the impurities to settle.\r\nThese may be shaved from the bottom of the cake and remelted if they\r\ncontain much wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                   =REARING AND INTRODUCING QUEENS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much of the bee keeper's success depends upon the strength of\r\nhis colonies, and this in turn upon the character of the queens\r\nheading these colonies, that he needs to be well informed as to what\r\nconstitutes a really good queen and how to produce such, and, having\r\nthis knowledge, it will be profitable to be constantly on the alert to\r\nsee that all colonies are supplied with the best queens procurable.\r\nWith a queen from a poor strain of bees, or an unprolific one from a\r\ngood strain, a colony, even in a season of abundant honey secretion,\r\nwill give little or no return, while the seasons are not frequent\r\nduring which one given a fair start and having a large, prolific queen\r\nof an active honey-producing strain can not collect a fair surplus\r\nbeyond its own needs. Admitting this, it will be plain to all that\r\nqueen bees differ proportionately in value as much as horses or cattle,\r\nand the keeper of bees who does not know how to select and produce the\r\nbest can not be called a bee-master.\r\n\r\nWhen bees swarm they generally leave a number of sealed queen cells\r\nin the parent colony. With blacks and Italians there are usually 6 to\r\n10; rarely more than a dozen. Carniolans generally construct about\r\ntwo dozen, but under favorable conditions can be induced to build 75\r\nto 100 good cells at a time. Fig. 62 represents a comb from a hive of\r\nCarniolans which had built at one time 70 queen cells. Cyprians usually\r\nmake 30 or 40 queen cells, but may greatly exceed this number under the\r\nbest conditions, while Syrians nearly always exceed it, sometimes even\r\nbuilding as many as 200; and the writer has seen 350 cells constructed\r\nat one time by a single colony of bees in Tunis. It might be thought\r\nthat where so many were constructed only a small proportion of them\r\nwould produce good queens. Such is not the case, however; for in\r\ngeneral a much larger proportion of the cells formed by these eastern\r\nraces produce well developed queens. But in all hives some queen cells\r\nare undersized. This may be because they are located near the bottom\r\nor sides, where space for full development is lacking, but in many\r\ninstances it arises from the fact that they are formed last, and larvæ\r\nthat are really too old to make full sized, perfect queens have to\r\nbe used. These smaller cells are usually smooth on the outside and\r\nshow thin walls. In selecting cells only the large, slightly tapering\r\nones, an inch or more in length and straight, should be saved. Yet\r\ngood queens may frequently be obtained from crooked cells, in case the\r\nlatter are large and extend well into the midrib of the comb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Comb showing worker brood and queen cells.\r\n(Original--from photograph.)]\r\n\r\nWhen a laying queen is removed from a colony during the working season,\r\neggs and larvæ of all ages are left behind. As indicated in Chapter\r\nII, any egg which has been fertilized may be made to develop into a\r\nqueen. So also larva? from such eggs may, up to the third day, be\r\ntaken to rear from without danger of producing inferior queens. Cells\r\nin which to produce queens will be started over some of these larvæ\r\non the edges of the combs, or, by tearing down partitions and thus\r\nenlarging the lower portion of the cell, a beginning is obtained for\r\na queen cell. Fig. 63 shows such queen cells constructed over eggs\r\nor larvæ originally designed to produce workers. They are known as\r\nemergency cells. The young larva is at once liberally supplied with\r\na secretion, which is probably a production of the glands of the\r\nhead, and which analyses have shown to be rich in nitrogen and fatty\r\nelements, being similar to that given at first to the worker larva.\r\nThis is continued throughout the whole feeding period, while, as Dr.\r\nVon Planta has shown, in the case of the workers and drones, after the\r\nthird day the proportion of the constituents of the larval food is so\r\nchanged that they receive much less albumen and fat and more sugar.\r\nIt is chiefly the influence of this food which causes the larva that\r\nwould have developed as a worker to become a queen. The latter has\r\nsomewhat changed instincts,, and its reproductive system is developed,\r\ninstead of abortive as in the case of the worker. The size of the cell,\r\nand, to a less extent perhaps, its position, no doubt influence this\r\ndevelopment, but the food seems to be the main factor, for small cells\r\nbuilt horizontally, if their larvæ are supplied with the food designed\r\nfor royal larvæ, will be found to contain queens, and frequently these\r\nqueens, even though small, are quite prolific, and show in all respects\r\nthe instincts of a queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Queen cells and worker brood in various\r\nstages. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIt is believed by most queen raisers that in order to secure the best\r\ndevelopment of the young queens a colony should be allowed to build but\r\na few cells at a time. That their belief is not well founded is shown\r\nby the facts just cited concerning the large numbers of well-developed\r\nqueen cells which produce also perfect and prolific queens. It lies\r\nwithin the skill of the bee-master to establish conditions favoring\r\nthe production of food for the queen larvæ--the so called \"royal\r\njelly\"--and this having been brought about, there need be no hesitancy\r\nin permitting the construction of hundreds of queen cells in one colony\r\nif such numbers are needed.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the plan, after removing the queen from a colony\r\nin order to secure queen cells, to trim the lower edges of the\r\ncombs containing eggs or very young larvæ, or to cut out strips of\r\ncomb about an inch wide just below worker cells containing eggs or\r\njust-hatched larvæ. This practice gave the bees space in which to\r\nbuild perfect full-sized cells, but it had certain disadvantages. Good\r\nworker combs were mutilated, often quite ruined, in order to secure\r\nthe construction of the cells and also in cutting out the latter.\r\nCells so formed are often in groups so close together that they can\r\nnot be separated without injury to numbers of them, necessitating, if\r\ndesirable to save all, a close watch, or at least frequent examination,\r\nfor hours or even days, since all the queens are not likely to emerge\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this Mr. O. H. Townsend, of Michigan, devised a plan which\r\nis described in Gleanings in Bee Culture for July, 1880 (Vol. VIII, p.\r\n322). It consists in cutting combs whose cells contain eggs or freshly\r\nhatched larvæ into narrow strips and pinning or sticking these on\r\nthe sides of brood combs in such a manner that the cells containing\r\nthe eggs or larvæ from which queens are desired shall open downward.\r\nMr. Townsend removed the larvæ from some of the cells, believing\r\nthat he secured better developed queens by limiting the number, and\r\nalso because he could then cut them out more easily for insertion in\r\nseparate hives. In the succeeding number of Gleanings (August, 1880),\r\nMr. J. M. Brooks, of Indiana, illustrated a plan for securing even\r\ngreater regularity. This consists in shaving off the cells on one side\r\ndown nearly to the midrib of each strip of worker comb containing the\r\neggs or larvæ selected to rear queens from, and then sticking these\r\nstrips on the undersides of horizontal bars nailed in ordinary comb\r\nframes. Mr. Henry Alley, in his work on queen rearing, published in\r\n1883, recommends sticking the prepared strips, shallow cells downward,\r\non the lower edges of combs which have been trimmed so as to round\r\ndownward. This leaves plenty of space for the full development of queen\r\ncells, the eggs or larvæ in alternate cells having been removed as in\r\nthe plans previously mentioned. All conditions being favorable, many\r\ncells conveniently located are thus secured, and if the exact age of\r\nthe eggs or just-hatched larvæ has been noted the time the young queens\r\nwill emerge may be known beforehand, so that preparation can be made\r\nfor them. Nuclei--small clusters of bees containing a quart to two\r\nquarts--are to be placed in separate hives and given combs, emerging\r\nbrood, and a supply of food, and to each of these a mature cell is to\r\nbe given. The nuclei thus prepared may be confined to their hives with\r\nwire cloth and placed in a cellar for two or three days, and when set\r\nout, just at dusk (p. 117), the bees will adhere to their new location.\r\nFull colonies, whose queens it is desired to replace, may also be made\r\nqueenless about two or three days beforehand, and when mature the cells\r\ninserted one each in these. In cutting out the cell a small piece of\r\ncomb, triangular shaped, 1½ to 2 inches long and about 1½ inches broad\r\nat the top, is to be left attached to it whenever practicable, since\r\nit will then be easy to insert it in one of the combs of the queenless\r\ncolony or nucleus, by cutting out a corresponding triangular piece.\r\nFig. 54 shows a queen cell inserted in a brood comb. It is safest not\r\nto cut the cells out until they are within twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nhours of their full maturity. In case a nucleus or colony has not been\r\nqueenless long enough to make it ready to accept a queen cell, the\r\nlatter may be placed in a cell protector made of wire cloth or of a\r\nspiral coil of wire and then inserted between the central combs of the\r\nhive. The lower end only of the protector is open, so that the upper\r\nportion of the cell--the part easily bitten open by the workers--is\r\nwholly covered.\r\n\r\nQueen nurseries on the general plan devised many years ago by Dr.\r\nJewell Davis, of Illinois, are used to hold surplus maturing cells and\r\nthe young queens, after emerging, for which colonies or nuclei are not\r\nready at once. These nurseries consist of compartments about 1½ inches\r\nsquare, made of wood and wire cloth, and so arranged that they may be\r\nsuspended in the center of a colony of bees, a frame being filled with\r\nthem for this purpose. Each compartment contains a bit of soft candy to\r\nsustain the life of the queen in case the bees fail to feed her. Spiral\r\ncoils of wire somewhat longer than those used as queen-cell protectors\r\nhave been arranged with a metal cup for food, so that, in principle,\r\nthey are the same as the compartments of the Davis queen nurseries and\r\nare used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe young queens will usually mate when from five to seven days old,\r\nflying from the hive for this purpose. If any undesirable drones are\r\nin the apiary they may be restrained from flying by means of excluder\r\nzinc over the hive entrances, permitting only workers to pass in and\r\nout. In a day or two after mating the queen generally commences to\r\ndeposit eggs, and is then ready for use in the apiary or to be sent\r\naway as an \"untested queen.\" To enable her to rank as a \"tested queen\"\r\nit will be necessary to keep her three weeks or a little longer in\r\norder to see her worker progeny and ascertain by their markings that\r\nthe queen has mated with a drone of her own race. As both tested and\r\nuntested queens are usually raised from the same mothers--the best in\r\nthe given apiary--either may be obtained for honey production; but for\r\nuse as breeders only tested queens which have been approved in every\r\nway should be purchased, unless, indeed, the purchaser prefers to buy\r\nseveral untested queens, which can usually be obtained for the price\r\nof one approved and selected breeder, and do his own testing, trusting\r\nthat among them one or more may prove valuable as a breeding queen.\r\n\"Warranted queens\" are untested queens sent out with a guaranty that\r\nthey have mated purely. If few or no drones of another race are in the\r\nvicinity of a breeder, he is tolerably safe in doing this. The proper\r\nplan is for the breeder to keep a record of the brood of all such\r\nqueens and replace such as show that they have mismated.\r\n\r\nExact records of the ages of all queens should be kept, and notes on\r\nthe qualities of their progeny are desirable, while in some instances\r\nparticulars as to pedigrees are valuable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--The Benton cage for transporting a queen and\r\nattendants by mail. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Caging a queen for mailing. (Original--from\r\nphotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MAILING QUEENS.\r\n\r\nQueens are now transported nearly always by mail, and sent to all parts\r\nof the United States, and even to distant foreign countries, the cage\r\nused almost exclusively being the one shown in fig. 64 or some slightly\r\nmodified form of the same. No attempt was ever made to patent this\r\ncage, and as the construction is obvious from the figure given here,\r\nanyone who desires can make and use it. The food usually employed in\r\nthese cages by queen breeders is a soft candy recommended many years\r\nago as bee food by the Rev. Mr. Scholz, of Germany. The Scholz candy\r\nis made by kneading fine sugar and honey together until a stiff dough\r\nhas been formed. Some think it an improvement to heat the honey before\r\nadding the sugar. The Viallon shipping candy consists of four parts\r\nof brown sugar and twelve of white sugar, with two tablespoonfuls of\r\nhoney and one of flour to each pound of the mixed sugars; these, with a\r\nlittle water added, form a batter, which is boiled until it commences\r\nto thicken, when it is poured into the food compartment of the mailing\r\ncage. Mr. I. R. Good recommended for use in queen cages a mixture\r\nof granulated sugar and extracted honey; hence this candy has since\r\nbeen known as the Good candy. The bees fed on it leave loose granules\r\nof sugar in the cage, and these becoming moist often daub the whole\r\ninterior in such a way as to cause the death of queen and workers. It\r\nis therefore not adapted to long journeys.\r\n\r\nThe food for the journey having been placed in the end opposite that\r\ncontaining the ventilating holes, a bit of comb foundation is pressed\r\ndown over it to assist in retaining the moisture, the food compartment\r\nhaving also previously been coated with wax for the same purpose. The\r\ncover, with perhaps a bit of wire cloth between it and the bees to\r\ngive greater security, together with the address and a 1-cent stamp,\r\ncompletes the arrangement for a queen and eight to twelve attendant\r\nworkers to take a journey of 3,000 miles. A special postal regulation\r\nadmits them to the mails at merchandise rates (I cent per ounce). For\r\ntransportation to distant countries of the Pacific a larger cage and\r\nmore care are necessary to success. A recent estimate by one of the\r\napiarian journals places the number of queens sold and thus transported\r\nin the United States annually at 20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          INTRODUCING QUEENS.\r\n\r\nMost of the mailing cages are arranged so that when received the\r\nremoval of the wooden lid and also of a small cork at one end will\r\npermit the bees to eat their way out when assisted by those of the hive\r\nto which the queen is to be given. The cage is laid, with the wire\r\ncloth down, on the frames of a colony that has previously been made\r\nqueenless. In twenty-four to forty-eight hours the queen will usually\r\nhave been liberated, but it is safer not to disturb the combs for four\r\nor five days lest the bees, on the watch for intruders when their combs\r\nare exposed, regard the new queen as such, and, crowding about her in a\r\ndense ball, sting her instantly or smother her.\r\n\r\nColonies having only young bees accept queens readily, so that when a\r\nswarm has issued and the parent stock has been removed to a new stand\r\nthe time for queen introduction is propitious. During a great honey\r\nflow queens are accepted without much question, if any at all. They may\r\nat such times nearly always be safely run in just at dark by lifting\r\none corner of the cover or quilt of a queenless hive and driving the\r\nbees back with smoke. The new queen, having been kept without food and\r\naway from all other bees for a half hour previously, is then slipped\r\nin and the hive left undisturbed for several days. This and similar\r\nmethods of direct introduction without cages, having been developed and\r\nadvocated by Mr. Samuel Simmins, of England, are known as the Simmins\r\nmethods of direct introduction of queens.\r\n\r\nIn the fall and at all times when honey is not coming in freely, caging\r\nthe queen for a few hours or days is desirable. A cage which permits\r\nthe queen to remain directly on the comb itself is infinitely superior\r\nto any other. Fig. 66 shows a pipe-cover cage as made by the author,\r\nthe size of which may be greater if circumstances require--that is,\r\nwhen it seems advisable, with a queen of great value, to include under\r\nthe cage a number of cells containing emerging brood. Ordinarily the\r\nsize here shown will suffice. The queen is caged before a closed window\r\non a comb of honey with five or six recently emerged bees taken from\r\nthe hive to which she is to be introduced. The comb holding the caged\r\nqueen is to be placed in the center of the queenless colony, where the\r\nbees will cluster on it, yet with the end of the cage pressed firmly\r\nagainst the adjoining comb, so that the cage will remain in place even\r\nthough a heavy cluster should gather on it. On the following day, just\r\nbefore dark, the queen should be released, provided that upon opening\r\nthe hive the workers are not packed densely about the cage trying to\r\nsting her through it. In the latter case she should be left twenty-four\r\nor even forty-eight hours longer, and in the autumn it is generally\r\nadvisable to keep her caged several days or even a whole week. If left\r\nlonger than one day all queen cells should be hunted out and destroyed\r\na few hours before releasing the queen. Feeding while the queen is\r\ncaged is a good plan if gathering is not going on briskly. Upon freeing\r\nthe queen, diluted honey drizzled down between the combs will serve to\r\nput the bees in a good humor for the reception of the new mother bee.\r\nThe entrance of the hive should be contracted for a short time so that\r\nbut a few bees can pass in or out at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Benton queen-introducing cage. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe conditions necessary to success in introducing queens are complied\r\nwith by the above plan, namely: The bees are queenless long enough\r\nto have become fully aware of the fact, yet usually not long enough\r\nto have started queen cells; the strange queen is caged a sufficient\r\nlength of time to acquire the peculiar odor of the hive to which she\r\nis to be given; the bees are all at home when the queen is released,\r\nand thus all become thoroughly gorged with food and are well disposed\r\ntoward the new queen. No robber-bees come about, and by morning all is\r\nin order.\r\n\r\nAs queens mate only once (p. 19), and workers and drones live but a few\r\nweeks or at most a few months (p. 20), if an Italian, a Carniolan, or\r\nother choice queen mated to a drone of her own race, be introduced to a\r\ngiven colony the bees of this colony will soon be replaced by others of\r\nthe same race as the queen introduced. All of the colonies of an apiary\r\nmay thus be changed; or, from a single breeding queen the apiary may be\r\nsupplied with young queens pure in blood, and, since these (even though\r\nmated to drones of another race) will produce drones of their own blood\r\nthe apiary will soon be stocked with males of the desired race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                        =INCREASE OF COLONIES.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NATURAL SWARMING.\r\n\r\nAn abundant secretion of honey and general prosperity of the\r\ncolony--with combs crowded with bees and brood--are the immediate\r\nconditions which incite a colony of bees to swarm. If a colony in\r\nprosperous condition be found when the gathering season has fairly\r\nopened, with eggs or larvæ in partly finished queen cells, a swarm\r\nmay be expected in a few days should the weather continue favorable.\r\nThe first one from a given hive usually issues within twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours after the sealing of the first queen cell. In the\r\ncase of strong colonies this may occur in favored situations in the\r\nNorth early in May, in the Middle States in April, and in the extreme\r\nSouth in March. But most of the swarms will come, in each section, a\r\nmonth later. When the flow of honey is prolonged the period during\r\nwhich swarms may issue is also extended, and in case a second flow\r\noccurs in midsummer, after an interruption, a second swarming period\r\nmay occur.\r\n\r\nThe outward indications immediately preceding swarming are a partial\r\ncessation of field work on the part of colonies that have been\r\nindustriously gathering and the clustering or loitering of the workers\r\nabout the entrances at times when they have usually been engaged in\r\ncollecting and when other colonies no more populous are at work.\r\nApparently many are awaiting the signal to migrate, while some seem\r\nnot to have caught the spirit, but continue their field work. Suddenly\r\ngreat excitement seizes the workers that happen to be in the hive at\r\nthe time. They rush forth pellmell, accompanied by the old queen, and\r\nafter circling about for some minutes cluster on some neighboring tree\r\nor shrub.\r\n\r\nIt very rarely happens that a swarm fails to cluster before leaving,\r\nbut it may do so if it has swarmed before and returned to the hive\r\nbecause the queen failed to accompany it. Spraying water on the leaders\r\nor advance portion of the swarm from a force pump, firing a gun among\r\nthem, or throwing the reflection from a mirror on them will disconcert\r\nthe absconding swarm and nearly always cause the bees to settle, but\r\nthe remedy must be at hand and applied instantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Hiving a swarm. (Original--from photograph.)]\r\n\r\nWhen a swarm has fairly settled it is best to hive it as soon as\r\npossible, lest others coming out may join it, occasioning a loss of\r\nqueens, and sometimes of bees, or much trouble in separating them.\r\nThe operation of hiving may appear very formidable to the novice and\r\nattended with great risks, but a little experience will dispel such\r\napprehensions. The bees before swarming usually fill their sacs with\r\nhoney and are quite peaceable, so that by the use of a little smoke\r\nin hiving there is seldom any difficulty. But to be doubly sure the\r\nnovice should sprinkle sweetened water over the cluster, and at the\r\nsame time wear a veil to protect his face. Of course, the hive has\r\nbeen ready for some time and has been standing in the shade so it will\r\nnot be heated. If the cluster should be on a small limb which can be\r\nreadily cut off, it can be laid down in front of the new hive, which\r\nshould have a full-width entrance or be raised up in front. The bees\r\nwill go trooping in, but if not fast enough gentle urging of the rear\r\nguard with a feather will hasten matters. If the bees have clustered\r\non a branch which it is desirable to preserve, yet where the hive can\r\nconveniently be placed directly under the cluster and close to it, the\r\nswarm may be shaken into the hive at once (fig. 67); or the hive may\r\nbe located on the stand it is to occupy and the bees shaken into a\r\nlarge basket or into a regular swarm catcher and poured in front of the\r\nhive. If the cluster is on the body of the tree it will be necessary\r\nto place the hive near and smoke or brush the bees into it. They will\r\ngo up more readily than down, and may often be dipped with a small tin\r\ndipper or a wooden spoon and poured in front of the hive. Whatever plan\r\nbe pursued, expedition is advisable, and it is best before leaving\r\nthem to see that nearly all of the bees are inside of the hive: at\r\nleast no clusters, however small, should be left on the tree, as the\r\nqueen might be among those left behind, in which case the swarm would\r\ndesert the new hive and return to the tree or go wherever the queen had\r\nsettled, or, failing to find her, would return to the hive whence they\r\nhad issued, unless meanwhile some other swarm should issue, which they\r\nwould be likely to join. A few bees flying about or crawling excitedly\r\nover the spot from which the main part of the swarm has been removed\r\nneed not be heeded. They will find their way back to the stand from\r\nwhich they came. As soon as the swarm is fairly within the new hive the\r\nlatter should be carried to its permanent stand, and well shaded and\r\nventilated. It is better policy, however, to place the hive containing\r\nthe first swarm on the stand of the parent colony at once, removing the\r\nlatter to a new location. The new swarm, having the old queen, with\r\nnearly all of the flight bees, will be in prime condition for storing\r\nhoney, so that supers may be placed on it as soon as it has made a fair\r\nstart in its new home--that is, on the second or third day after the\r\nswarm was hived. If there are uncompleted supers on the parent colony\r\nwhich has been removed, they should be lifted over to the new hive on\r\nthe second or third day, as the parent colony, having parted with so\r\nmany of its workers, will not be able to store at once. But the new\r\nswarm, placed in a clean hive with starters only, will be in shape to\r\nstore in sections at once and produce the whitest combs and honey which\r\nthe source of the yield will permit.\r\n\r\n                           CLIPPING QUEENS.\r\n\r\nTo prevent swarms from absconding and to facilitate the work of hiving\r\nthem, as well as to keep track more easily of the ages of queens, many\r\npersons prefer to clip the wings of their queens as soon as mated. The\r\nfirst season one of the large or primary wings is clipped half away;\r\nat the opening of the second season the Other large wing, and the\r\nthird season an additional clip is taken from one of the large wings,\r\nand with it a portion of one of the secondary or smaller wings. With\r\nfinely pointed scissors this operation can be performed while the queen\r\nis loose on the combs, but there is much danger of clipping one or more\r\nof her legs also. If she be caught by her wings with the thumb and\r\nfirst finger of the right hand, and then grasped by the thorax with\r\nthe thumb and first two fingers of the left hand, her wings can easily\r\nbe reached with the scissors. It will not do to grasp the queen by the\r\nabdomen? and of course there should be but little pressure exerted on\r\nthe thorax. There are some objections against clipping. The queens,\r\nbeing unable to fly, are liable to get lost in the grass or stray into\r\nthe wrong hives when they swarm during the absence of the attendant.\r\nThey certainly look unsightly when thus maimed, and occasionally the\r\nbees are more disposed to replace such queens than unmutilated ones. It\r\nis of course preferable to lose one of these occasionally rather than\r\nthe whole swarm. When the queen is clipped the operation of hiving is\r\nvery easy if the bee keeper is on hand to catch the queen as she falls\r\nfrom the entrance to the ground. When the swarm is fairly out and while\r\nthe bees are still circling in the air an empty hive should be set in\r\nplace of the one from which the swarm has issued. The bees, missing\r\ntheir queen, will soon begin to return to their old location and will\r\nshortly crowd the entrance of the new hive. When about one-fourth have\r\nentered the queen may be allowed to run in, and the treatment will then\r\nnot be different from that given any newly hived swarm.\r\n\r\n                           AUTOMATIC HIVERS.\r\n\r\nThus far the automatic hivers have been only partially successful, so\r\nthat the experimental stage has not yet been passed; but the practical\r\nperfection of such a device is looked forward to with considerable\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n                     PREVENTION OF AFTER-SWARMING.\r\n\r\nThe parent colony, removed from its old hive as soon as the first\r\nswarm issues, will rarely cast a second swarm, especially if a young\r\nqueen is at hand to be introduced within a day or two. The surplus\r\nqueen cells are likely to be destroyed by this young queen, with the\r\nassistance of the workers. A laying queen will be readily accepted\r\nby a colony which by swarming and removal has lost its old bees,\r\nand ten to fifteen days will be gained in the production of brood.\r\nUnless increase is especially desired it is best to limit it in this\r\nway to first swarms. If still less increase is wanted, methods which\r\nwill be referred to later may be followed to prevent swarming as far\r\nas possible, and such chance swarms as do issue may be returned to\r\nthe parent hive. If the queens are two or more years old, they may\r\nin most instances be profitably destroyed at this time and young\r\nones introduced from nuclei; but whether introducing young queens or\r\nreturning the swarm with its old queen, great care must be taken to\r\ndestroy every queen cell, otherwise the introduced queen may be killed\r\nor the swarm may again issue. If, however, no young queen is at hand\r\nand it is desirable to replace the old queen, all cells but one may be\r\ndestroyed, but this must on no account be jarred or dented. The danger\r\nof overlooking a cell where the hive is crowded with bees makes this\r\nmethod somewhat uncertain: moreover, when the bees have once got the\r\n\"swarming fever\" they may swarm again without preparation in the way of\r\nqueen cells. It is also very troublesome to remove supers to get at the\r\nbrood combs. These difficulties will induce many who may wish to limit\r\nthe number of their colonies to prefer hiving the swarms on starters\r\nof foundation on the old stands and giving them the supers, while the\r\nparent colonies are placed near them with entrances turned away for\r\na few days. The flight bees return, of course, to the old stand. The\r\nparent colony should be turned a little each day so as to bring it\r\nin five or six days side by side with the hive containing the swarm,\r\nwhich is on the old stand, and make its front face in the same way. By\r\nlifting it a day or so later, while the young bees are flying, over to\r\nthe opposite side of the old stand and turning its entrance away from\r\nthat of the hive on this stand, the bees that are flying, as well as\r\nthose that have marked their last location, will join the swarm: and if\r\nthe same operation be repeated at the end of another week most of the\r\nremaining bees will find their way within a day or two into the hive on\r\nthe old stand. About this time--that is, some fifteen or sixteen days\r\nafter the issuance of the first swarm--the young queen will commence\r\nlaying and may be put in place of the old one which issued with the\r\nswarm. If honey is still coming in, the young queen, with accompanying\r\nbees, may usually be safely introduced at this time by shaking them in\r\nfront of the hive from which the queen has been removed, both lots of\r\nbees having been smoked beforehand so as to get them to fill themselves\r\nwith honey: or the two combs between which the queen is found may be\r\nlifted, with adhering bees, and placed in the center of the colony to\r\nwhich the queen is to be given. Before doing this it is best to smoke\r\nthe latter pretty thoroughly, and if two of the brood combs from this\r\nhive have been removed a few hours before and placed, after their\r\nbees have been shaken off, in the colony to be united, and all other\r\ncombs taken away from the latter, the bees, with their queen, will\r\nbe clustered on these brood combs, and they may be lifted up without\r\ndisturbance and placed in the middle of the other hive, whose supers\r\nand cover are to be put in place at once and the bees left to quiet\r\ndown and resume storing. Under these circumstances the loss of a queen\r\nwill be very rare: nevertheless, in the case of an exceptionally\r\nvaluable one, cages and other methods are advisable. (See Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ARTIFICIAL INCREASE.\r\n\r\nThe time lost in watching for swarms and hiving them, the occasional\r\nlosses of swarms, and the vexations attendant upon their issuance, such\r\nas their clustering in tall trees, uniting and killing queens, and the\r\ndelay in their swarming when the time has come for it, have led bee\r\nkeepers to devise methods which would save their time and avoid as far\r\nas possible the uncertainties connected with this feature of their\r\nwork. Where increase is desired the question is one of considerable\r\nimportance. In the more northern States, where the main honey yield\r\ncomes on suddenly and is abundant for a short period only, and swarming\r\nis confined mainly to a period of four to six weeks, or even to three\r\nweeks if the colonies are of pretty uniform strength, this question\r\nhas less weight; but farther south, where the yield is more prolonged\r\nand the period during which swarms are liable to issue is sometimes\r\nextended over three or four months, it is of considerable moment, and\r\nthe bee master who intends to multiply the number of his colonies will\r\ndo well to follow some good system of control.\r\n\r\n                               DIVIDING.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of artificial increase is to lift from the populous\r\ncolony a portion of the combs, with adhering bees, and place them in\r\nanother hive near the parent colony, taking care that the part without\r\nany queen should have a majority of the bees and should be on the old\r\nstand. If a mature queen cell is at hand to give to this part a day or\r\ntwo after the division, the new colony will soon have a laying queen,\r\nshould all go well. But this last point will need looking after ten\r\ndays or so later. Should a laying queen be at hand to supply to the\r\nqueenless portion of the divided colony, the queen found in the hive at\r\nthe time of the division had better be left in that part of the colony\r\nwhich remains on the original stand, since the old bees will of course\r\nreturn to that spot and will not as readily receive a strange queen\r\nas will the removed portion of the colony which has parted with its\r\nflight bees. By introducing a laying queen when the division is made\r\nthe deposition of eggs will be begun a week earlier than if a cell only\r\nshould be given. At this season of the year this will make a difference\r\nof a good many thousands of workers, and will also prevent the bees\r\nfrom clogging the brood combs with honey, as they would if left without\r\na laying queen for a week or more. The supers are to be placed on this\r\npart on the old stand, which, having most of the flight bees, will be\r\nfar better able to store surplus than the other portion. The plan of\r\nmaking the division nearly equal is quite objectionable in case it is\r\nfollowed closely by the main honey flow of the season, for it places\r\nneither colony in the best condition for immediate storing. But if only\r\na moderate yet continuous honey flow, followed by a larger yield, is to\r\nbe anticipated, both parts will have time to become populous, and the\r\nequal division, if done in time--that is, before the \"swarming fever\"\r\nhas taken hold of the colony--will be likely to prevent swarming.\r\n\r\n                         DRIVING OR BRUSHING.\r\n\r\nIn case, however, some immediate work is expected of either part of\r\nthe divided colony, it is preferable to make the division in such a\r\nway as to secure about all of the flight bees as well as most of the\r\nyoung bees, which will soon become flight bees, in the hive on the old\r\nstand. This may be done by shaking or brushing nearly all of the bees\r\nfrom the combs of the hive to be divided, or, if the latter is a box\r\nhive, the swarm may be driven into an empty box, as described under\r\n\"Transferring,\" in Chapter VII, and then hived as an ordinary swarm,\r\nthe parent colony receiving also the same treatment as described under\r\n\"Natural swarming.\"\r\n\r\n                          THE NUCLEUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the safest plan, considering that the yield, even when one is\r\nacquainted with the flora, can not be foretold, is to follow the plan\r\nof making nuclei, and, as soon as these have laying queens, building\r\nthem up gradually to full colonies by adding frames of brood, frames\r\nfilled with worker comb, or with comb foundation, or merely starters,\r\nas may seem best. This system, besides being safe, has certain other\r\nadvantages. It leaves the parent hives strong for the working season,\r\nyet tends to discourage swarming, because whenever colonies become\r\novercrowded, and before they have contracted the swarming fever, one or\r\nmore brood combs are removed and the colony is thus induced to continue\r\nwork in the brood chamber to fill the empty space, while, of course,\r\nthey are kept supplied with plenty of storage room above for surplus\r\nhoney. Furthermore, it is easy to exchange the young queen of the\r\nnucleus, as soon as she commences laying, with the queen of the full\r\ncolony. If the nucleus has been started early, the full colony will\r\nthus secure a queen of the current season's raising sufficiently early\r\nto reduce greatly the probability of its wanting to swarm that year,\r\neven though permitted to get very strong, as it is almost certain to do\r\nunder such circumstances. These nuclei build straight combs and may be\r\nrelied on to build, even without foundation, worker comb only.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, a rational method of artificial increase is preferable to\r\nnatural swarming; but experience and judgment in carrying it out are\r\nrequired to make it advantageous. It should be cautiously undertaken by\r\nthe beginner, and the main reliance placed upon natural swarming until\r\nthe bee keeper is familiar with the bees' way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PREVENTION OF SWARMING.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly practiced and easily applied preventive measure is\r\nthat of giving abundant room for storage of honey. This to be effective\r\nshould be given early in the season, before the bees get fairly into\r\nthe swarming notion, and the honey should be removed frequently,\r\nunless additional empty combs can be given in the case of colonies\r\nmanaged for extracted honey, while those storing in sections should be\r\ngiven additional supers before those already on are completed. With\r\ncolonies run for comb honey it is not so easy to keep down swarming as\r\nin those run for extracted honey and kept supplied with empty comb.\r\nFree ventilation and shading of the hives as soon as warm days come\r\nwill also tend toward prevention. Opening the hives once or twice\r\nweekly and destroying all queen cells that have been commenced will\r\ncheck swarming for a time in many instances, and is a plan which\r\nseems very thorough and the most plausible of any to beginners. But\r\nsometimes swarms issue without waiting to form cells; it is also very\r\ndifficult to find all cells without shaking the bees from each comb in\r\nsuccession, an operation which, besides consuming much time, is very\r\nlaborious when supers have to be removed, and greatly disturbs the\r\nlabors of the bees. If but one cell is overlooked the colony will still\r\nswarm. The plan therefore leaves at best much to be desired, and is in\r\ngeneral not worth the effort it costs and can not be depended on.\r\n\r\n                              DEQUEENING.\r\n\r\nThe removal of a queen at the opening of the swarming season\r\ninterferes, of course, with the plans of the bees, and they will then\r\ndelay swarming until they get a young queen. Then if the bee keeper\r\ndestroys all queen cells before the tenth day, swarming will again be\r\nchecked. But to prevent swarming by keeping colonies queenless longer\r\nthan a few days at most is to attain a certain desired result at a\r\ndisproportionate cost, for the bees will not store diligently when\r\nfirst made queenless, and the whole yield of honey, especially if the\r\nflow is extended over some time or other yields come later in the\r\nseason, is likely, or even nearly sure, to be less from such colonies,\r\nwhile the interruption to brood rearing may decimate the colony and\r\nprove very disastrous to it. The plan is therefore not to be commended.\r\n\r\n                              REQUEENING.\r\n\r\nQuite the opposite of this, and more efficacious in the prevention\r\nof swarming, is the practice of replacing the old queen early in\r\nthe season with a young one of the same season's raising, produced,\r\nperhaps, in the South before it is possible to rear queens in the\r\nNorth. Such queens are not likely to swarm during the first season,\r\nand as they are vigorous layers the hive will be well populated at\r\nall times and thus ready for any harvest. This is important inasmuch\r\nas a flow of honey may come unexpectedly from some plant ordinarily\r\nnot counted upon, and also since the conditions essential to the\r\ndevelopment of the various honey-yielding plants differ greatly, their\r\ntime and succession of honey yield will also differ with the season,\r\nthe same as the quantity may vary. Young queens are also safest to\r\nhead the colonies for the winter. The plan is conducive to the highest\r\nprosperity of the colonies and is consistent with the securing of the\r\nlargest average yield of honey, since besides giving them vigorous\r\nlayers it generally keeps the population together in powerful colonies.\r\nIt is therefore to be commended on all accounts as being in line with\r\nthe most progressive management, without at the same time interfering\r\nwith the application of other preventive measures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--The Simmins non-swarming system--single-story\r\nhive with supers: _bc_, brood chamber; _sc_, super; _st_, starters of\r\nfoundation; _c_, entrance.

It is an excellent preventive measure, though\r\nnot invariably successful even when the distinctive features brought\r\nforward prominently by Mr. Simmins--empty space between the brood\r\ncombs and entrance, together with the employment of drawn combs in the\r\nsupers--are supplemented by other measures already mentioned; but when,\r\nin addition to the space between the brood and the flight hole, the\r\nprecaution be taken to get supers on in time, to ventilate the hive\r\nwell, and to keep queens not over two years old, swarming will be very\r\nlimited. If to these precautions be added that of substituting for the\r\nold queens young ones of the current season's raising, before swarming\r\nhas begun, practical immunity from swarming is generally insured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Beehives with Langdon non-swarmer attached:\r\n_A, B_, hives; _S, S′_, supers; _D_, non-swarming device; _e, e′_,\r\nentrances corresponding to hive entrances; _sl_, slide for closing\r\nentrance; _c, c′_, conical wire-cloth bee-escapes; _ex, ex′_, exits of\r\nsame. (From Insect Life.)]\r\n\r\n                     LANGDON NON-SWARMING DEVICE.\r\n\r\nThis device (fig. 70, _D_), first described and illustrated in Insect\r\nLife for April, 1893 (Vol. V, No. 4), is designed to do more than\r\nmerely prevent swarming. The following claims are made by the inventor:\r\n\r\n    (1) It prevents all swarming without caging queens, cutting out\r\n       queen cells or manipulation of brood combs.\r\n\r\n    (2) Two light colonies that would not do much in sections if\r\n       working separately make one good one by running the field force\r\n       of both into the same set of supers.\r\n\r\n    (3) No bait sections are needed, as the bees can be crowded into\r\n       the sections without swarming.\r\n\r\n    (4) The honey will be finished in better condition, that is, with\r\n       less travel stain, because the union of the field forces enables\r\n       them to complete the work in less time.\r\n\r\n    (5) There will be fewer unfinished sections at the close of the\r\n       honey harvest for the reason just mentioned.\r\n\r\n    (6) Also for the same reason honey can be taken off by the full\r\n       case instead of by the section or holderful.\r\n\r\n    (7) Drones will be fewer in number, as a double handful will often\r\n       be killed off in the closed hive while the other is storing\r\n       honey rapidly.\r\n\r\n    (8) Artificial swarms and nuclei can be more easily made, as combs\r\n       of brood and bees can be taken from the closed hive in which the\r\n       queen can be found very quickly.\r\n\r\n    (9) It enables one to care for more than twice as many colonies as\r\n       under the swarming system.\r\n\r\nResults according with the claims mentioned above have been reported\r\nfrom various localities, but numerous adverse reports have also been\r\ngiven, the latter indicating clearly that some modification of the\r\ndevice is necessary if it is to be made generally serviceable. A\r\nfurther trial of the principle under varying conditions and climates\r\nwill also be required to decide its exact value.\r\n\r\nThe manner of using the device is simple. Before the colonies swarm\r\nthe device is attached to the fronts of two adjacent hives. The slide\r\n(fig. 70, _sl_) having been inserted at one end of the device, the bees\r\nreturning from the fields are all run into the other hive, on which the\r\nsupers are then placed. Before the colony, thus made doubly populous,\r\ndecides to swarm, the slide and supers are both changed to the other\r\nhive. This is repeated every four or five days during the swarming\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n                        SELECTION IN BREEDING.\r\n\r\nSome races of bees show greater inclination than others toward\r\nswarming, and the same difference can be noted between individual\r\ncolonies of a given race; therefore, whatever methods be adopted to\r\nprevent or limit increase, no doubt the constant selection of those\r\nqueens to breed from whose workers show the least tendency toward\r\nswarming would in time greatly reduce this disposition. Indeed, it is\r\nperfectly consistent to believe that persistent effort, coupled with\r\nrigid and intelligent selection, will eventually result in a strain\r\nof bees quite as much entitled to be termed non-swarming as certain\r\nbreeds of fowls which have been produced by artificial selection are to\r\nbe called non-sitters. These terms are of course only relative, being\r\nmerely indicative of the possession of a certain disposition in a less\r\ndegree than that shown by others of the same species. It might never\r\nbe possible to change the nature of our honey bees so completely that\r\nthey would never swarm under any circumstances, and even if possible it\r\nwould take a long period, so strongly implanted seems this instinct.\r\nBut to modify it is within the reach of any intelligent breeder who\r\nwill persistently make the effort. Such work should be undertaken in\r\nexperimental apiaries where its continuance when a single point has\r\nbeen gained will not be affected by the changes of individual fortunes.\r\n\r\nMany features connected with swarming still remain mysteries. The whole\r\nsubject requires still more study, and its full elucidation would no\r\ndoubt be of great practical value to apiculture. The field is inviting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                           =WINTERING BEES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be little complaint of losses in wintering bees, whether in\r\na cold climate or a warm one, whether indoors or outside, provided the\r\nfollowing points are observed with each colony:\r\n\r\n(1) _The colony must have a good queen._--By a good queen is meant one\r\nnot over two years old and which shows no signs of failure during the\r\nlatter part of the season. It is preferable to have a queen of the\r\ncurrent season's raising. Such a queen, if reared from good stock and\r\nunder good conditions during the latter part of the summer, will be in\r\nher prime the following spring, and if no other conditions are lacking\r\nwill have her colony strong for the harvest.\r\n\r\n(2) _Plenty of good bees._--Bees that are several months old or that\r\nhave gathered a heavy fall harvest of honey are not good to depend\r\nupon for the winter. They drop off gradually of old age before there\r\nare young bees to fill their places, and the queen, however prolific,\r\nnot having bees enough to cover her eggs, can not bring up, as she\r\notherwise would, the strength of the colony to a proper standard in\r\ntime for the harvest. There should be young bees emerging at all times\r\nup to the month of October, or, in the South, even later.\r\n\r\n(3) _Good food and plenty of it._--Any well-ripened sealed honey\r\nthat is not crystallized is good winter food. Honeydew stored by\r\nbees and honey from a few flowers (cruciferous plants, asters, etc.)\r\ncrystallizes in the combs soon after it is gathered and the bees are\r\nobliged to liquefy it as they use it. They can not do this well in dry,\r\ncold weather, and dampness within the hive, though it might enable\r\nthe bees to liquefy the crystallized honey, is otherwise inimical to\r\nbee life, especially so during winter. Some of the crystallized food\r\nis also wasted; hence the bees may starve even though the fall weight\r\nindicated sufficient stores for winter. Disastrous results are very\r\nlikely, therefore, to follow the attempt to winter on such food.\r\n\r\nThe removal of all pollen when preparing bees for winter has been\r\nadvised by some, who assert that it is unfit winter food and produces\r\ndysentery. It will not, of course, alone sustain the life of the adult\r\nbees, but if all conditions are right no more of it will be eaten than\r\nthe bees require to repair the waste of bodily tissue, and this being\r\nslight in winter the consumption is small as long as other food lasts.\r\nThe pollen grains which by accident find their way into honey as the\r\nbees gather it would probably be quite sufficient to supply this waste\r\nin the case of the adult workers and no harm would result to these bees\r\nfrom the substitution of other combs for those containing pollen. But\r\ngood colonies should begin brood rearing in January or February, and\r\npollen or a suitable substitute for it containing nitrogen most then\r\nbe present or the nurse bees will be subjected to a fearful drain on\r\ntheir vitality to supply the rich nitrogenous secretion required by\r\nthe developing larvæ; in fact, they can not do so long, and the colony\r\ndwindles. This absurd theory that bees can not have access to pollen in\r\nwinter without detrimental results can best be answered by referring to\r\nthe well-known fact that a colony in a large box or straw hive, freely\r\nventilated, yet having some part of the hive protected from drafts\r\nof air and kept dry, will almost invariably come out strong in the\r\nspring if populous in the fall, heavy with honey, and having a young\r\nand vigorous queen. The pollen, it could not possibly be claimed, had\r\nbeen injurious to such colonies, although they always gather and store\r\nit without restriction, and are not disturbed in the possession of it.\r\nIn truth, their stores of pollen have constituted an important factor\r\nin their development, and the strong instinct which they have toward\r\nmaking accumulations of pollen for winter use and which they have\r\nexercised for thousands of years undisturbed is of great benefit to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Percolator for preparation of winter food.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nOther conditions being equal, those colonies having the most honey\r\nstored compactly in the brood apartment and close about the very\r\ncenter where the last brood of young bees should emerge, are the ones\r\nwhich will winter best. Forty pounds for a northern latitude and 30\r\nin the middle sections of the Tinted States may be considered only a\r\ngood supply. When natural stores are found to be lacking in the brood\r\nchamber, the best substitute is a sirup made of granulated sugar, which\r\nshould be fed early in the autumn as rapidly as the bees can manipulate\r\nit and store it away. If given slowly the bees will be incited to rear\r\nbrood unseasonably, and will consume much of the food in this way.\r\nIf several pounds be given at a time--placed in the top story of the\r\ncolony to be fed, just at nightfall--it will be stored away quickly,\r\nso that in a week at most the full winter stores will be completed.\r\nThe bees will seal it over better if fed slowly at the last; that is,\r\nafter the main feeding. Sirup made by percolation of cold water through\r\na mass of sugar and then through some porous material, as cotton, is\r\nwhat is called a completely saturated solution; that is, it contains\r\nall the sugar the water can be made to hold, and will not trouble\r\nby granulation (fig. 71). The same difficulty is avoided by adding\r\nwell-ripened honey to moderately thick sirup, about one-fourth or\r\none-fifth as much honey as sirup. Molasses, brown sugar, glucose, etc.,\r\nare not suitable for winter stores for bees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--The American straw hive of Hayek Bros.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Davis hive with newspapers packed between\r\ninner and outer cases, and brood frames on end for the winter.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nIt is poor policy to permit bees to enter winter quarters without an\r\nabundance of stores--better twice the amount that will be actually\r\nconsumed than merely enough to enable them to live through.\r\n\r\n(4) _The bees must be kept dry and warm._--A substantial hive with\r\na tight roof will keep rain and snow from the cluster; but the bees\r\nmust have air even during the severest weather and also when in their\r\nmost quiescent state; hence the question of ventilation has to be\r\nconsidered. It has occasioned more discussion and experimentation\r\nthan any other point concerned in the wintering of bees. The amount\r\nof ventilation both indoors and outside, whether upward ventilation\r\nor lower ventilation, or both, and whether through the wooden walls\r\nof the hive alone, have given rise to thousands of experiments based\r\non all sorts of theories, and innumerable losses have resulted. The\r\nmatter is really more complicated than would seem at first thought. The\r\nwarm air about the bodies of the bees (the winter temperature of the\r\ncluster being about 72° F.) coming in contact with the cold surfaces\r\nof combs of honey in ordinary hives, or with the inner Avails of such\r\nhives, condensation and deposition of moisture occurs. During severe\r\nweather this accumulates in the shape of hoarfrost, which, melting with\r\na rise of temperature, trickles down over the combs, the walls of the\r\nhive, and the bees themselves, and, entering the honey cells through\r\nthe somewhat porous capping, sours the honey with which it mixes. The\r\nsoured food, dampness, and chilling of the bees combine to bring on\r\ndiarrhea, which is sure to weaken and decimate the colony if it does\r\nnot exterminate it. To avoid these troubles the surplus moisture of the\r\nhive must be carried away by free ventilation, which at the same time\r\nsupplies pure air, but which does not create drafts in the hive nor\r\npermit such an escape of heat as will chill the cluster through. Straw\r\nhives (fig. 72) do this well; also the forms shown in figs. 73 and 74\r\nif well packed over the combs and ventilated above the packing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Double-walled hive adapted to outdoor\r\nwintering as well as summer use below 40° north latitude in the United\r\nStates. Thickness of each wall, ⅜ inch; space between walls, 2 inches,\r\npacked with dry chaff or ground cork. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n(5) _There should be no manipulation out of season._--Breaking up the\r\ncluster and exposing the individual bees and their combs to a low\r\ntemperature, as well as causing them to gorge themselves with honey\r\nwhen an opportunity for a cleansing flight may not occur soon, are also\r\ncauses which bring on diarrheal difficulties. Feeding to complete the\r\nwinter stores, when necessary, should be done soon after the last honey\r\nflow, so that the bees will settle down for the winter on the approach\r\nof cool autumn days. After this they are better off if left undisturbed\r\nuntil the final work of preparing them for winter is done, which, if\r\nthe hive is well arranged, will be no material disturbance to the bees.\r\nIt is always preferable not to be obliged to touch the brood combs or\r\ndisturb the cluster when the weather is too cold for the bees to fly\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OUTDOOR WINTERING.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the requirements above mentioned leads at once to\r\nthe essential features of any plan of outdoor wintering that may be\r\nfollowed in the colder portions of our country with uniform success,\r\nnamely, the presence in the colony of a vigorous queen less than two\r\nyears old; a good cluster of healthy bees bred the latter part of the\r\nseason, that is, of sufficient numbers so that when closely clustered\r\nduring quite cool weather late in October or November not less than six\r\nspaces between the brood combs, and preferably eight or nine spaces,\r\nshall be occupied by a good number of bees, or that the cluster shall\r\nbe at such a time not less than 8, and preferably 10 to 12, inches\r\nin diameter; the stores should consist of 30 pounds of well-ripened\r\nhoney or thick sugar sirup, stored and mostly sealed over and about\r\nthe bees; since in a long, shallow hive the heat is too diffused,\r\ncombs much longer than deep should be on end for the winter, to enable\r\nthe bees to economize their natural warmth; free access of pure air,\r\nbut without the creation of drafts, hence the entrance should be\r\nindirect or screened in some manner; the ventilation should permit the\r\ngradual passing away of the moisture-laden air of the hive, but not\r\nthe escape of heat, hence 6 or more inches (in the coldest portions of\r\nthe United States 10 or 12 inches) of dry, porous material, soft and\r\nwarmth-retaining, should be on all sides of the cluster and near to\r\nit, the whole being protected by waterproof walls from any access of\r\noutside moisture. Care to establish in all cases conditions similar\r\nto the above before bees cease flying in the autumn will insure the\r\napiarist against any serious losses in wintering out of doors, even in\r\nthe severest portions of our country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--An apiary in Vermont--winter view. (Reproduced\r\nfrom photograph.)]\r\n\r\nIn the extreme South, where bees can fly out at any time of the year,\r\nlittle extra precaution is needed for the winter beyond seeing that the\r\nstores do not become exhausted during a drought or a protracted rain,\r\nwhen no honey can be gathered. Just in proportion to the severity and\r\nlength of the winter season the above general rules may be looked upon\r\nas applicable, always bearing in mind, however, that in the variable\r\nclimate of the middle section of the country many of the precautions\r\nstrictly essential in a colder climate may still be profitably\r\nfollowed, although fair results may be expected in the main without\r\ntheir strict observance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INDOOR WINTERING.\r\n\r\nDry cellars or special repositories are utilized in those portions\r\nof the country where the cold of winter is extreme and likely to be\r\nsomewhat continuous. Economy of food is one of the chief advantages,\r\nbut two-thirds as much, or about 20 to 25 pounds per hive, are needed\r\nto bring a colony through if conditions are favorable. The colonies,\r\nprepared as regards bees, queens, character of stores, etc., the same\r\nas for outdoor wintering, are carried into the cellar or repository\r\njust before the first snows come or severe freezing occurs. Caps are\r\nremoved or lifted up and cushions or mats laid on the frames. Light is\r\nexcluded and all other disturbing influences in so far as possible,\r\nthe effort being made to keep the temperature at about 42° F. during\r\nthe earlier part of the winter. Later, especially after brood-rearing\r\nmay have been begun, a somewhat higher degree is admissible--45° to\r\n46°, some even allowing it to go up to 50°. No definite rule can be\r\ngiven, however, since much depends upon the humidity of the air, etc.\r\nAs long as the bees remain quiet the temperature is not too high and is\r\npreferably to be maintained. Should they become exceedingly restless,\r\nand the opportunity occur during a winter thaw to give them a cleansing\r\nflight, it will be advisable to return them for a few hours or a day or\r\ntwo to their summer stands, and when they have flown and quieted down,\r\nreplace them in the cellar or repository. In the spring there should\r\nnot be too great eagerness to get them out of the cellar, provided\r\nthey are not restless. Their confinement indoors makes them somewhat\r\nsensitive to the outside cold, and due caution should be observed, else\r\nthe ranks of the workers will become greatly decimated before young\r\nones appear to take their places.\r\n\r\nThe same questions regarding ventilation of hives indoors that\r\npuzzle many in the case of those left on their summer stands have\r\nbeen discussed over and over. All that is necessary, however, is\r\nto consider the same points, the question being less complicated,\r\nthough, by reason of the greater uniformity between the temperature\r\nsurrounding the cluster of bees and that outside the hive when the\r\nlatter is in a suitable winter repository. Some have reported success\r\nin wintering in damp cellars, yet it is probable that such success was\r\npurely accidental, or rather occurred in spite of the dampness of the\r\nrepository, the other conditions very likely having all been favorable,\r\nespecially as regards ventilation of the cellar, and the important\r\npoints of having good stores and an even temperature, which should be\r\nseveral degrees higher than is required in a dry cellar. Wintering in\r\na damp repository is, however, attended in general with such risks\r\nthat it should by all means be avoided, and the bees, even in a severe\r\nclimate, intrusted preferably to their summer stands, if well prepared\r\nas regards their stores and populousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                    =DISEASES AND ENEMIES OF BEES.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on wintering bees allusion has been made to certain\r\nconditions which bring about diarrhea in bees. Not only will soured or\r\nfermented honey produce this disease, but thin honey also, by requiring\r\ntoo great exertion on the part of the bees to get rid of the surplus\r\nmoisture taken into their bodies, may indirectly cause the disease.\r\nRepeated complaints have been made by those located near cider mills\r\nthat the apple juice collected by their bees was the cause of diarrhea\r\nand dysentery. Aphidid secretions sometimes have the same effect.\r\nProlonged and intense cold in the interior of the hive, especially if\r\nthe stores are not of the best quality, causes distention and resulting\r\nweakness and soiling of the hive and combs. Dampness and chilling of\r\nindividual bees frequently cause it. The effort some make to avoid the\r\ndampness often results in the chilling, for the cover is removed, and\r\nalso some portion of the packing or the quilt or honey board to let the\r\nair pass through to dry the interior. The true remedy is a cleansing\r\nflight and warmth in the hive. Should the weather not be favorable\r\nfor this out of doors, the hive may be brought into a warm room and a\r\ncage of wire cloth 2 or 3 feet square placed over the entrance. When\r\nthoroughly warmed up the bees will fly in this and find their way back\r\ninto the hive. It is best to leave them in the warm room two or three\r\ndays, lowering the temperature gradually before returning the hive to\r\nits outside stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOUL BROOD.\r\n\r\nThis disease, being highly contagious, is dreaded most of all by the\r\nbee keeper. It is due to the presence of minute vegetable organisms\r\nin the body of the bee, the larva, or the egg, which prey upon its\r\ntissues. These, as Prof. Frank Cheshire has shown, are bacilli, which,\r\nmultiplying with marvelous rapidity by division and also by spores,\r\nare carried from hive to hive, until from a single infection the whole\r\napiary is soon ruined. The particular bacillus which is commonly known\r\nas foul brood Professor Cheshire has described as _Bacillus alvei_,\r\nor hive bacillus, as it affects not only the brood but also the adult\r\nbees. (See Pl. XI.) The first symptoms noticeable in the hive are its\r\nlack of energy, then dead larvæ turned black in the cells, and finally\r\nsunken caps, some of them perforated slightly over larvæ and pupæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bul. 1, new series, Div. of Entomology, U.

Caution is necessary or it maybe spread\r\nall through the apiary. The hands, as well as all tools used about\r\nthe infected colony, should be cleansed by washing in a solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate (one-eighth ounce dissolved in 1 gallon water)\r\nbefore going to another hive. If but few are found diseased they should\r\nbe burned at once--at night, when all the bees are at home. If all\r\nor nearly all are affected, or if the disease does not seem virulent\r\nand other apiaries in the neighborhood are not endangered thereby, a\r\ncure may be attempted. Removal of all of the combs and confinement\r\nof the bees in an empty box, obliging them to fast until some drop\r\nfrom hunger, followed after releasing them by liberal feeding, will\r\nfrequently effect a cure, as indicated many years since by Mr. M.\r\nQuinby. The hives may be disinfected by washing in carbolic-acid\r\nwater and used again. A second removal of the bees and fasting may\r\nbe necessary in some cases. It will also be well to feed medicated\r\nsirup--1 part of carbolic acid, or phenol, to 600 or 700 parts of\r\nsirup. Many omit the fasting, but destroy all combs and frames and\r\nsupply comb-foundation starters, removing four days later all combs\r\nbuilt and giving a second lot of starters. It is well to supplement\r\nthis treatment with feeding of medicated sirup. Phenol having been\r\nsuggested to Professor Cheshire as a remedy, he experimented until he\r\nfound that if a sirup containing 1 part of phenol to 400 or 500 parts\r\nof the food be poured in the cells adjacent to the brood, and the\r\ndiseased brood, after brushing off the bees, sprayed with a solution of\r\n1 phenol to 50 water, a cure was speedily effected. The great risk of\r\nspreading the disease, as well as the time and expense which a cure by\r\ndrugs by the fasting process involves, will cause immediate destruction\r\nto be resorted to as the cheapest in the end if taken in time.\r\n\r\n_Bacillus gaytoni_, also described by Professor Cheshire, is\r\ncharacterized by loss of hairy covering on the part of the workers and\r\ntheir crawling out of the hives over the ground, constantly wriggling\r\ntheir bodies until death occurs. It yields, according to Professor\r\nCheshire, to the same remedies as Bacillus alvei, but having been less\r\ndestructive and being far more likely to disappear without effort to\r\ncure it, less attention has been given to it. Lately, however, it\r\nhas been alarmingly destructive in some of the extensive apiaries of\r\nCalifornia. Colorado, and Texas, so that some simple remedy would be\r\nvery welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE WAX OR BEE MOTH.\r\n\r\nThe larva of a moth known to entomologists as _Galleria mellonella_\r\nLinn. gnaws passages through the combs of the bees, especially those\r\nin or near the brood nest, often proving very destructive in weak or\r\nneglected colonies. The popular name, wax moth, was doubtless given\r\non the supposition that the food of the larva was chiefly wax; but\r\nwhen an attempt to rear them on this substance in its usual commercial\r\npurity is made slight development only results. Probably chemically\r\npure wax would not be touched by the larva; but in combs containing the\r\nlarval skins left by developing bees, or containing brood or pollen,\r\nthey reach their highest development if left undisturbed during warm\r\nweather, finding ample nourishment in the nitrogen-containing pollen\r\nand animal tissues left by the molting larvæ. To protect themselves\r\nfrom the bees they line their galleries through the combs with a strong\r\nweb of silk and are able to retreat or advance rapidly through them\r\nwhen attacked. The observing bee keeper will occasionally notice the\r\nmoths resting during the daytime on the corners of the hives or under\r\nthe roof projections or edges of the bottom boards. Its color is dull\r\nor ashy gray, with light and dark streaks, making it so nearly like a\r\nprotruding sliver of a weather-beaten board as to protect it materially\r\nfrom its enemies when resting on any unpainted surface that has been\r\nlong exposed. At nightfall the moths may be seen flitting about the\r\nhive entrances, seeking an opportunity to enter and deposit their eggs.\r\nIf prevented by the bees, which are then instinctively on the alert,\r\nthey deposit in the crevices between the hive and stand or between the\r\nhive and cap. The minute larvæ as they emerge soon make their way into\r\nthe interior of the hive. It is possible also that some of the eggs\r\nof the moth may be left where the bees crawling over them carry them\r\ninto the hive by accident, the freshly laid egg adhering readily to\r\nany substance it touches. In the northern and middle sections of the\r\nUnited States two broods are reared, the first appearing in May, the\r\nsecond and larger brood in midsummer or even August. The eggs deposited\r\nby the last brood develop slowly in the cooler autumn weather, but\r\nusually reach the pupal stage, in which they normally pass the winter.\r\nIndividual moths may, however, be seen about the apiary during June and\r\nJuly, and even into the autumn, so that egg deposition is constantly\r\ngoing on, and any combs removed from the hive and left unprotected by\r\nbees, especially if in a warm apartment or a closed box, will soon be\r\nin complete possession of the destructive larvæ, which wax fat and\r\nsoon reduce them to a mass of webs. The only remedies are to keep the\r\ncombs under the constant protection of the bees, or, if the colonies\r\nare not populous enough to cover them fairly, the combs should be hung\r\nso as to leave a space between them in a cupboard or large box which\r\ncan be closed tightly, so as to subject them for some time to the fumes\r\ngenerated by throwing a handful or two of sulphur on live coals, or to\r\nthe odors of bisulphide of carbon in an open vial. Caution is needed in\r\nthe use of the latter, since it is highly inflammable.\r\n\r\nOriental races of bees are more energetic than others in clearing out\r\nwax-moth larvæ, and Carniolans and Italians more so than the common\r\nbees. But in colonies always supplied with good queens the wax-moth\r\nlarvæ make little headway, and it is therefore only the neglected\r\nhives that are seriously troubled. Moth-trap attachments or moth-proof\r\nhives are therefore of no use, unless, in the case of the former,\r\nlarvæ seeking a secure place in which to pupate may be caught; but\r\nthat implies frequent examination, and the same or less attention to\r\nthe colony itself will suffice to do away with almost any breeding of\r\nmoths. Hives proof against the entrance of wax-moth larvæ would, as\r\nthe statements here made regarding the breeding habits of the moth\r\nindicate, exclude the bees also. From the foregoing it can be readily\r\nseen that the attentive apiarist no longer regards the wax moth as a\r\nserious pest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BRAULA OR \"BEE LOUSE.\"\r\n\r\nA wingless dipteron, _Braula cæca_ Nitsch, known under the common name\r\nof \"bee louse,\" is a troublesome parasite on bees in Mediterranean\r\ncountries, the adults, which are very large in proportion to the host,\r\ngathering on the thoraces of the workers, rarely of the drones, but\r\nin great numbers on the queens. The writer has removed seventy-five\r\nat one time from a queen, though ordinarily the numbers do not exceed\r\na dozen. When numerous they render the queen weak by the removal of\r\nvital fluids. The insect has frequently been imported to this country\r\non queens with attendant bees, but thus far has probably gained no\r\nfoothold. Likely it will never do so in the North, but the case might\r\nbe different in any region resembling southern Europe in climate, and\r\nit is by all means advisable to remove every one from any queen or\r\nworker arriving here infested with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OTHER ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n_Robber flies, dragon flies, etc._--Several species of _Asilus_ and\r\nrelated predaceous Diptera do not live upon injurious insects alone,\r\nbut also capture and devour honey bees. They are more destructive in\r\nthe South than elsewhere. The same is true of the neuropterous insects\r\nknown as mosquito hawks, dragon flies, or devil's darning needles.\r\nThere seems to be no remedy for any of these except that of frightening\r\nthem away when noticed about the apiary. The \"stinging bugs,\" belonging\r\nin the hemipterous family Phymatidæ, often capture and destroy workers\r\nas they visit the flowers. No remedy is practicable.\r\n\r\n_Ants and wasps._--Some of the larger ants and social wasps are very\r\ntroublesome to the apiarist in tropical and even in subtropical\r\nregions. They seize the workers and cut them in pieces with their\r\npowerful jaws. Having once reduced the hive defenders, they even make\r\nbold to enter and carry off the queen as well as help themselves to\r\nhoney. Trapping them with honey or with meat and killing them, as well\r\nas destroying the nests when found, are the only remedies. The paper\r\nnests are easily burned away, while an effectual remedy against ants is\r\nto open the hill and pour in an ounce or two of bisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\n_Spiders._--Webs made about hive entrances often capture bees as well\r\nas wax moths, and, notwithstanding this last-mentioned point in their\r\nfavor, they had better be removed.\r\n\r\n_Toads and lizards._--These devour many bees, and whenever found near\r\nthe hives should be destroyed or removed to the vegetable garden.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Swallows and kingbirds have been accused of eating many bees.\r\nIt is probable that the destruction of injurious insects by them more\r\nthan makes amends for the bees taken. This was clearly proven in the\r\ncase of the kingbird, stomachs of which, examined at the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, showed only a very small percentage of honey\r\nbees, and these mostly drones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MAMMALS.\r\n\r\nMice gaining access to the hive during winter gnaw out among the combs\r\na nest cavity and eat honey, pollen, and bees. Low entrances, covered,\r\nif found necessary, with a strip of tin, will prevent the mice from\r\ngnawing larger holes, yet permit the bees to pass in and out. Skunks\r\nsometimes disturb hive entrances and catch bees as they come out. This\r\nis particularly vexatious in the winter, when colonies should be left\r\nquiet. In mountain localities, bears, led by their fondness for honey,\r\nstill occasionally overturn beehives. The remedies for both of these\r\nare, of course, shooting or trapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ROBBER BEES.\r\n\r\nWhen forage is scarce in the field, bees belonging to different\r\ncolonies often wage fierce wars over the stores already in hives.\r\nThousands are killed and the victors relentlessly carry off as booty\r\nevery drop of honey from the vanquished hive, leaving its bees to\r\nstarve miserably. A great stir and loud buzzing in the hive of the\r\nconquerors attests their rejoicing over the ill-gotten gains. Nor have\r\nthey any code of morals which inclines them to select as opponents\r\nforces equal in strength to their own. With them \"all's fair in war.\"\r\nTheir only object is plunder, and they therefore select the most\r\ndefenseless, a colony disorganized through loss of its queen being an\r\nespecial mark for a combined attack.\r\n\r\nExtreme caution to prevent robbing is always advisable. A little\r\ncarelessness or neglect in the apiary early in the spring or toward\r\nthe latter part of the season may result in much loss. It is easier to\r\nprevent robbing than to check it at once or without loss after it is\r\nwell under way. Leaving honey exposed about the apiary often induces\r\nrobbers to begin their work; hence extracting and similar work must\r\nbe done in bee-proof rooms whenever the bees are not gathering honey\r\nfreely. It may at such times be necessary to do all manipulating early\r\nin the morning, before many of the bees have begun to fly, or later in\r\nthe day, after they have ceased, or even under a tent made of mosquito\r\nnetting and placed temporarily over the hive to be manipulated.\r\nQueenless and weak colonies should be put in order if possible before\r\nthe honey flow ceases. In any event the entrances of such hives should\r\nbe contracted until but few or even no more than one bee can gain\r\naccess to the interior at one time. Professor Cheshire has devised an\r\nexcellent entrance block to prevent or check robbing. This is shown in\r\nfig. 70, and is so simple that anyone can make it. When contracted and\r\nplaced at the hive entrance it will be seen that the robbers must make\r\ntheir way through a narrow and bent passage, something they are loath\r\nto attempt, especially if at the first onset they find the passage well\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Cheshire anti-robbing entrance: _st_,\r\nstationary piece; _s_, slide; _p_, pin or stop. (Redrawn.)]\r\n\r\nIf robbing has begun it may sometimes be stopped by throwing coarse\r\ngrass or weeds over the entrance of the hive attacked, or by leaning\r\na pane of glass against its front, the entrance being, of course,\r\ncontracted as indicated above. These plans tend to confuse the robbers\r\nfor a time, and meanwhile the rightful occupants of the hive may be\r\nable to organize for defense. If convenient the colony attacked may be\r\nmoved a distance of a half mile or more and placed as far as possible\r\nfrom other apiaries until it can recuperate. Another plan in extreme\r\ncases is to put the colony in a dark cellar for a few days, confining\r\nthe bees to the hive with wire cloth, so as to allow plenty of\r\nventilation, as described under the head of \"Moving bees.\" When brought\r\nout of the cellar it is well to place the colony on a new stand, apart\r\nfrom the other bees, contract the entrance, and lean a board against\r\nthe front of the hive. It is also safest to bring it out late in the\r\nday, even just at dusk, so the bees will begin flying from it gradually\r\nand not attract the attention of robbers. It may be well, when removing\r\na colony from its stand to save it from robbers, to put in its place\r\na hive with combs containing a little honey and pollen. The robbers,\r\ninstead of scattering and entering adjacent hives, will continue to\r\nvisit the same stand, their numbers gradually diminishing as the honey\r\ngives out and the pollen is sucked dry. If meanwhile the entrances of\r\nadjoining hives have been contracted and these colonies are fairly\r\nstrong and in normal condition, individual robbers will be successively\r\nrepulsed as they appear. Quiet will thus be eventually restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LAYING WORKERS.\r\n\r\nAlthough laying workers are not strictly enemies of their kind, their\r\nwork hastens the extinction of the colony to which they belong, in case\r\nthe latter has become queenless and is without the means of rearing\r\nanother queen. They cause the expenditure of the stores and strength\r\nof the colonies in a vain though well-meant endeavor to perpetuate\r\ntheir species; the eggs which laying workers deposit, and for whose\r\ndevelopment through the larval stage much honey and pollen are\r\nrequired, only resulting in the production of a lot of drones, for the\r\nmost part weak and dwarfed.\r\n\r\nIf not discovered until the hive is nearly depopulated, the remaining\r\nold bees should be brushed off, and the combs, after the sealed drone\r\nbrood has been unmapped and jarred out, may be distributed among other\r\ncolonies. Should the affected colony still be worth saving, combs\r\ncontaining emerging bees should be added and a queen introduced a few\r\ndays later, or a queen cell inserted, as soon as the added brood has\r\nstocked the hive well with young bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             =BOOKS AND JOURNALS RELATING TO APICULTURE.=\r\n\r\nThe following are among the leading books and journals relating to\r\napiculture:\r\n\r\n                                BOOKS.\r\n\r\n  Langstroth on the Honey Bee.
