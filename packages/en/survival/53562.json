Gold,\r\niron, coal and marble have not only contributed largely to the\r\nenterprise and opulence of America, but at this very moment they exert a\r\ncommanding influence in political circles. No one can prophesy the\r\ngreatness of the commercial power which is sure to rise on their\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nNo other country can boast of such vast and valuable mineral deposits.\r\nYet our country is not half developed. Treasures lie undiscovered in our\r\nmountains and under our farms,--gems of “purest ray serene” and still\r\nmore precious metals. Some will be accidentally brought to light; but\r\nthe majority are so disguised that their real nature is not seen. How\r\nunpromising are the best ores of iron, zinc and silver and the rarest\r\ngems! Then, again, there is “mimicry” in the mineral kingdom; worthless\r\nstones are often good imitations of the valuable, and fortunes have been\r\nsunk in mining pyrites for gold, mica for silver and slate for coal. But\r\nif we wait for mineralogists to develop our mineral resources, we must\r\nwait a millenium, our country is so vast and scientific laborers so few.\r\nFortunately, however, nature has stamped upon each mineral some peculiar\r\nfeature or assemblage of characters which enable any one with average\r\ncommon sense to distinguish those which are of value in the arts.\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is to point out those distinctions so clearly\r\nand in popular language that those who do not claim to be scientific may\r\ndetermine specimens for themselves; in other words, to furnish _a key\r\nfor the ready determination of all the useful minerals within the United\r\nStates_.[1]\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and forty-four mineral species have been found within the\r\nbounds of the Union. Of these only one-third are of any use to the\r\npractical man. These eighty have certain general characters in common,\r\nbut always some specific differences. The object is to divide them into\r\ngroups, as the botanist divides the plants, and then to separate the\r\nindividuals by some properties or features peculiar to each. Only those\r\nminerals are mentioned which are useful: any specimen, therefore, which\r\ndoes not fit any of the descriptions given, may be considered of no\r\nspecial value. By the term “color,” is meant the color of a fresh\r\nfracture, for the exposed surface often misrepresents the true aspect.\r\nExact color is not meant, but “red” stands for reddish, “yellow” for\r\nyellowish, “white” for a light gray up to the perfectly transparent.\r\n“Magnetic” means that the specimen disturbs the needle of a compass, or\r\nthat a magnet will take up fine particles. A mineral is “opaque” if the\r\nlight will not pass through either the edges or a thin fragment. A\r\n“translucent” mineral is either clear as crystal or only allows light to\r\npass dimly through a thin portion. “Effervescence” is the bubbling\r\nproduced by the escape of a gas, as in soda-water. “Gravity” is the\r\nweight compared with that of an equal bulk of water. In the majority of\r\ncases the specimen can be determined without it; but there may be\r\nseveral doubtful cases which can be settled only by obtaining the\r\ngravity. This is done by first weighing a fragment of the mineral in a\r\nsmall apothecary or jeweler’s balance, reckoning it in grains. Then by\r\na thread suspend it below one of the scales in a tumbler of water,\r\ntaking care that the specimen is covered with water and does not touch\r\nthe sides. Subtract the weight in grains as it hangs in the water from\r\nthe first weight, and divide the first weight by the difference: the\r\nresult is the gravity. Five per cent. should be allowed for impurities.\r\nWhere exactness is not required, the gravity of a specimen may be judged\r\nby comparing it with well-known substances. Thus,\r\n\r\nThe gravity of anthracite coal is about   1.5\r\nThe gravity of brick is about             1.8\r\nThe gravity of clay is about              2.0\r\nThe gravity of marble and glass is about  2.5\r\nThe gravity of slate is about             2.8\r\nThe gravity of cast-iron is about         7.0\r\nThe gravity of copper is about            9.0\r\nThe gravity of lead is about             11.0\r\n\r\nIf the gravity of a mineral is 1.5, a cubic inch of it will weigh about\r\n¾ ounce; if 2., 1 oz.; if 2.5, 1¼ oz.; if 3., 1½ oz.; if 4., 2 oz.; if\r\n5, 2½ oz., etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no section of our country that may not reward a diligent search\r\nfor precious or useful minerals. The rocks, however, between the\r\nAlleghanies and the Atlantic and between the Rocky Mountains and the\r\nPacific furnish the greater variety and abundance. Here are found the\r\nbest ores. Gold and silver seem to abound more on the western than\r\neastern sides of both mountain-chains. A trap-region, like the shore of\r\nLake Superior and the Connecticut River Valley, is likely to be a good\r\nlocality for copper and iron. The Mississippi Valley, or the region of\r\nBituminous Coal, furnishes chiefly iron and lead; gold, silver and\r\ncopper are seldom found. In general, where the layers of rock lie level\r\nand contain fossil shells, it is a locality good only for soft coal,\r\n(New York excepted), iron ore, gypsum and salt. The regions of granite,\r\nslate, limestone, marble, etc., offer the greatest inducement to search\r\nfor useful minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR DETERMINING SPECIMENS BY THE KEY.\r\n\r\n     HOW TO TEST MINERALS WITH THE SIMPLEST MEANS--PROSPECTING WITH A\r\n     JACK-KNIFE AND COMMON SENSE--USE OF THE KEY--HOW TO TELL PYRITES\r\n     FROM GOLD AND QUARTZ FROM DIAMOND--ALL THE USEFUL MINERALS GROUPED\r\n     ACCORDING TO HARDNESS AND COLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst see whether it will scratch common window-glass. If it will make\r\nthe least mark, it belongs to division A; if not, it is to be found in\r\ngroup B. Next notice whether the light will shine through it: if it does\r\nnot pass through even the edges or a thin splinter, it is opaque; if any\r\nlight is allowed to pass, it is translucent. With a knife see if it is\r\nharder or softer than pure white marble; then, noting its color, compare\r\nit with the descriptions of minerals referred to by the numbers. If it\r\nagree with none, it may be considered of no use in the arts. To make\r\ndoubly sure, get the gravity as described on page 12.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Suppose we have an unknown mineral in hand. We first try to\r\nscratch glass with it and find it impossible. It therefore belongs to\r\nsection B. Next we find it is opaque and yellow, and evidently heavier\r\nand harder than marble. It must be one of two: 44 attracts the\r\ncompass-needle, and this will not; it is consequently 26 or _Copper\r\nPyrites_, if it agree with the description. If not, it is something of\r\nno great value.\r\n\r\nYou have found what you think is a diamond, Does the specimen scratch\r\nglass? Yes, easily, and is brittle. Can you see through it? You say it\r\nis clear as glass. Look now under section A, “translucent” series,\r\nnumber 6 (for it is colorless), and decide which of the four it is. The\r\nfirst one (27), is diamond; but do not let your wishes _make_ it agree.\r\nTurning to the description, you read that it can not be scratched with\r\na file or worn down on a grindstone. This decides against it. Besides,\r\nthe gravity (2.5) is too little. With the next (57) it agrees perfectly,\r\nand you need not go further. Should the specimen, however, agree very\r\nwell with rock crystal, only that its gravity (3.5) is too great, then\r\nit is topaz.\r\n\r\n☞ All minerals that scratch glass are brittle, and all (save 32 and\r\n46) are infusible or melt with great difficulty.\r\n\r\n☞ The following minerals will burn, evaporate or melt without a flux\r\nin an ordinary fire: Nos. 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23,\r\n24, 26, 29, 33, 35, 37, 44, 53, 55, 62, 63, 70, 71, 75. All but the\r\nfollowing are heavier than marble: 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 34, 36, 40,\r\n47, 48, 56, 60, 61, 69, 71. Nos. 2, 50 and 58 alone dissolve in water.\r\n\r\n☞ In determining color, be sure you have a fresh surface, for the\r\noutside is often deceptive. By “blow-pipe” is meant the tapering tube\r\nused by watch-makers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nWILL SCRATCH GLASS.\r\n\r\nI.

Water also acts in another way a very important part in\r\nthe discovery of mineral veins, as by closely examining the faces of the\r\ndifferent gullies and ravines, which intersect a country, a ready means\r\nis afforded of ascertaining whether its strata are traversed by\r\nmetalliferous deposits; and, therefore, in exploring with a view to its\r\nmineral productions, no opportunity should be lost of observing the\r\nvarious sections thus naturally laid bare.\r\n\r\nWhen fragments of an ore are found on a hill-side, it is very evident\r\nthat the vein must lie higher up. If the vein is horizontal and the\r\nfragments are found on the top of the hill, there is no probability of\r\nfinding much if any of the vein, for generally it has been washed away.\r\nOre-veins, however, are almost always nearly vertical; so that boring is\r\nof little use, as it might pass by the richest vein, or, striking it\r\nlengthwise, give a too favorable result.\r\n\r\nAs heavy minerals do not drift far, metals are always found near their\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nHorizontal beds can be worked at the least cost.\r\n\r\nPockets and nodules, or any detached masses of minerals, are soon\r\nexhausted. Veins, lodes and beds are most valuable.\r\n\r\nBoring a three-inch hole, which costs about $1 a foot, is a good method\r\nof testing a mineral vein or bed which lies more or less horizontally. A\r\nshaft may be sunk in sandstone for from $6 to $3 per cubic yard; in\r\nslate and gravel, at from $2 to $1.\r\n\r\nThe existence of mineral springs, and the rapid melting of the snow in\r\nany locality, are no indications of ores.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR DIAMONDS.--Few things are so unpromising and unattractive\r\nas gems in their native state. Hence their slow discovery. There is\r\nlittle doubt that diamonds exist in many places as yet unknown, or where\r\ntheir presence is unsuspected. It is very difficult for the unpracticed\r\neye to distinguish them from crystals of quartz or topaz. The color\r\nconstitutes the main difficulty in detecting their presence. They are of\r\nvarious shades of yellowish brown, green, blue and rose-red, and thus\r\nclosely resemble the common gravel by which they are surrounded. Often\r\nthey are not unlike a lump of gum arabic, neither brilliant nor\r\ntransparent. The finest, however, are colorless, and appear like\r\nrock-crystals.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, where great numbers of diamonds, chiefly of small size, have\r\nbeen discovered, the method of searching for them is to wash the sand of\r\ncertain rivers in a manner precisely similar to that employed in the\r\ngold fields, namely, by prospecting pans. A shovelful of earth is thrown\r\ninto the pan, which is then immersed in water, and gently moved about.\r\nAs the washing goes on, the pebbles, dirt and sand are removed, and the\r\npan then contains about a pint of thin mud. Great caution is now\r\nobserved, and ultimately there remains only a small quantity of sand.\r\nThe diamonds and particles of gold, if present, sink to the bottom,\r\nbeing heavier, and are selected and removed by the practiced fingers of\r\nthe operator. But how shall the gems be detected by one who has had no\r\nexperience, and who in a jeweler’s shop could not separate them from\r\nquartz or French paste? The difficulty can only be overcome by testing\r\nsuch stones as may be suspected to be precious. Let these be tried by\r\nthe very sure operation of attempting to cut with their sharp corners\r\nglass, crystal or quartz. When too minute to be held between the finger\r\nand thumb, the specimens may be pressed into the end of a stick of hard\r\nwood and run along the surface of window glass. A diamond will make its\r\nmark, and cause, too, a ready fracture in the line over which it has\r\ntraveled. It will also easily scratch rock-crystal, as no other crystal\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nBut a more certain and peculiar characteristic of the diamond lies in\r\nthe form of its crystals. The ruby and topaz will scratch quartz, but no\r\nmineral which will scratch quartz has the _curved edges_ of the diamond.\r\nIn small crystals this peculiarity can be seen only by means of a\r\nmagnifying glass; but it is invariably present. Interrupted, convex or\r\nrounded angles, are sure indications of genuineness. Quartz crystal is\r\nsurrounded by six faces; the diamond by four. The diamond breaks with\r\ndifficulty; and hence a test sometimes used is to place the specimen\r\nbetween two hard bodies, as a couple of coins, and force them together\r\nwith the hands. Such a pressure will crush a particle of quartz, but the\r\ndiamond will only indent the metal.\r\n\r\nThe value of the diamond is estimated by the carat, which is equal to\r\nabout four grains, and the value increases rapidly with its weight. If a\r\nsmall, rough diamond weigh four grains, its value is about $10; if eight\r\ngrains, $40; if sixteen grains, $640. A cut diamond of one carat is\r\nworth from $50 to $100.\r\n\r\nThe imperfections of the diamond, and, in fact, of all cut gems, are\r\nmade visible by putting them into oil of cassia, when the slightest flaw\r\nwill be seen.\r\n\r\nA diamond weighing ten carats is “princely;” but not one in ten thousand\r\nweighs so much.\r\n\r\nIf a rough diamond resemble a drop of clear spring water, in the middle\r\nof which you perceive a strong light; or if it has a rough coat, so that\r\nyou can hardly see through it, but white, and as if made rough by art,\r\nyet clear of flaws or veins; or, if the coat be smooth and bright, with\r\na tincture of green in it,--it is a good stone. If it has a milky cast,\r\nor a yellowish-green coat, beware of it. Rough diamonds with a greenish\r\ncrust are the most limpid when cut.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are found in loose pebbly earth, along with gold, a little way\r\nbelow the surface, towards the lower outlet of broad valleys, rather\r\nthan upon the ridges of the adjoining hills.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR GOLD.--The paying localities of gold deposits are the\r\nslopes of the Rocky and Alleghany Mountains. Gold need not be looked for\r\nin the anthracite and bituminous coal-fields nor in limestone rock. It\r\nis seldom found in the beds of rivers. The thing itself is the surest\r\nindication of its existence. If soil or sand is “washed” as described in\r\nChapter V., and the particles of gold are not heavy enough to remain at\r\nthe bottom but float away, the bed will not pay.\r\n\r\nAlong streams rather high up among the mountains, and in the gravelly\r\ndrift covering the slopes of the valley below, are the best prospects.\r\nWhere the stream meets an obstacle in its path or makes a bend or has\r\ndeep holes, there we may look for “pockets” of gold. Black or red sands\r\nare usually richest. Gold-bearing rock is a slate or granite abounding\r\nin rusty looking quartz veins, the latter containing iron pyrites or\r\ncavities. Almost all iron pyrites and silver ores, may be worked for\r\ngold. When the quartz veins are thin and numerous rather than massive,\r\nand lie near the surface, they are considered most profitable. Few veins\r\ncan be worked with profit very far down. As traces of gold may be found\r\nalmost everywhere, no one should indulge in speculation before\r\ncalculating the percentage and the cost of extraction. Gold-hunting,\r\nafter all, is a lottery with more blanks than prizes.\r\n\r\nThe substances most frequently mistaken for gold are _iron pyrites_,\r\n_copper pyrites_ and _mica_. The precious metal is easily distinguished\r\nfrom these by its malleability (flattening under the hammer) and its\r\ngreat weight, sinking rapidly in water.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR SILVER.--This metal is usually found with lead ore and\r\nnative copper. Slates and sandstones intersected by igneous rocks as\r\ntrap and porphyry, are good localities. Pure silver is often found in or\r\nnear iron ores and the dark brown zinc blende. The Colorado silver lodes\r\nare porous at the surface and colored more or less red or green. Any\r\nrock suspected of containing silver should be powdered and dissolved in\r\nnitric acid. Pour off the liquid and add to it a solution of salt. If a\r\nwhite powder falls to the bottom which upon exposure turns black, there\r\nis silver in it. Silver mines increase in value as in depth, whereas\r\ngold diminishes as we descend.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR COPPER.--The copper ores, after exposure, or after being\r\ndipped in vinegar, are almost invariably green on the surface. They are\r\nmost abundant near trap dykes. The pyrites is generally found in lead\r\nmines, and in granite and clay-slate. Copper very rarely occurs in the\r\nnew formations, as along the Atlantic and Gulf borders, and in the\r\nMississippi Valley south of Cairo.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR LEAD.--Lead is seldom discovered in the surface soil. It\r\nis also in vain to look for it in the coal region and along the coast.\r\nIt must be sought in steep hills, in limestone and slate rocks. A\r\nsurface cut by frequent ravines or covered by vegetation in lines,\r\nindicates mineral crevices. The galena from the slate is said to\r\ncontain more silver than that from the limestone. The purest specimens\r\nof galena are poorest in silver; the small veins are richest in the more\r\nprecious metal. A lead vein is thickest in limestone, thinner in\r\nsandstone and thinnest in slate.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR IRON.--Any heavy mineral of a black, brown, red or yellow\r\ncolor may be suspected to be iron. To prove it, dissolve some in oil of\r\nvitriol and pour in an infusion of nut-gall or oak-bark; if it turns\r\nblack, iron is present. If a ton of rich magnetic ore costs more than $4\r\nat the furnace, good hematite more than $3, and poor ores more than\r\n$1.50 or $2, they are too expensive to pay, unless iron is unusually\r\nhigh. Deep mining for iron is not profitable. Generally speaking, a bed\r\nof good iron ore, a foot thick, will repay the cost of stripping it of\r\nsoil, etc., twelve feet thick. Red and yellow earths, called ochres,\r\ncontain iron. Magnetic ore is easily found by a compass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF ORES.\r\n\r\n     WHEN AN ORE WILL PAY--WASHING FOR GOLD AND PLATINUM--HOW TO ASSAY\r\n     GOLD IN THE SIMPLEST WAY--TO TEST ANY ROCK FOR GOLD AND SILVER--TO\r\n     FIND THE PURITY OF GOLD--TO DETECT AND ASSAY SILVER ORES--ASSAY OF\r\n     COPPER, IRON, ZINC, TIN AND LEAD ORES--READY METHOD OF TESTING\r\n     GRAPHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions asked after the discovery of a metallic ore,\r\nis--“will it pay?” We propose to state in plain words a method of\r\ndetermining the character and value of the principal ores, so that any\r\nintelligent man, however unscientific, may answer his own question. The\r\nchemical analysis or exact assaying of ores is too complicated, and must\r\nbe left to professional assayers.\r\n\r\n“Will it pay?” is an important query; for many ores of even precious\r\nmetals, are not “paying.” Whether an ore is profitable depends not so\r\nmuch upon the relative value of the metal as upon the ease of separating\r\nit from the rock or “gangue” as it is called. Thus the minimum\r\npercentage of metal, below which the working of the ore ceases to be\r\nprofitable is--\r\n\r\nOf Iron,        25         per cent.\r\n   Zinc,        20             “\r\n   Lead,        20             “\r\n   Antimony,    20             “\r\n   Copper,      02             “\r\n   Tin,         01½         “\r\n   Quicksilver, 01             “\r\n   Silver,        1/2000       “\r\n   Platinum,      1/10000      “\r\n   Gold,          1/100000     “\r\n\r\nThat is, an ore of iron which contains less than 25 per cent. of metal\r\nwill not pay for working; for the reduction of iron in comparison with\r\ncopper ore is very difficult. Gold is very easily extracted, and hence\r\nsome quartz rocks which do not apparently contain a particle of gold,\r\npay well, a bushel of rock often yielding half an ounce.\r\n\r\nIron occurs in large masses or beds; but the other metals are scattered\r\nin fragments through sand or soil, or exist in veins running through\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nWASHING FOR GOLD AND PLATINUM.--This operation, called “panning,” is the\r\noldest and simplest method of extracting the precious metals. At the\r\npresent time, it furnishes to Russia nearly all the gold produced in\r\nthat empire. It is based on the principle that substances of different\r\nweights may be separated by means of water,--the heaviest going to the\r\nbottom first. To examine the bank or bed of a river, suspected to\r\ncontain gold, fill a milk-pan with the sands and carry it to a tub or\r\npool of quiet water. Dip it under, stirring the mass with one hand or a\r\nstick. Then pour off the muddy water, fill with fresh water stirring\r\nagain, and again pour off the light sand, clay, etc. Scales of gold will\r\nsink fast; mica flakes will take their time. Repeat this process till\r\nall the fine particles are washed off; then allow just enough water to\r\nenter the pan as will cover the sand. By shaking the pan and gradually\r\nlowering the side by which it is held, the light sand will flow off,\r\nleaving in the corner a heap of coarse sand. Put in a small quantity of\r\nwater and turn the pan around so as to create a gentle current, when the\r\nprecious metal, if there be any, can be easily detected,--the gold by\r\nits bright lustre, the platinum by its lead color, and both by their\r\nmalleability. Particles of gold are of uniform color and are either flat\r\nor rounded; while other yellow grains are angular. Holding the pan in\r\nthe sunshine, secure any glittering glassy crystals, and test them for\r\ndiamonds or rock-crystals. A magnet will remove any particles of\r\nmagnetic iron-ore.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF GOLD ORE.--Gold may be found in quartz rock, in iron and copper\r\npyrites, and in silver ores.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain if any gold is present in quartz, reduce the rock to\r\npowder and sift it. A certain quantity, say half a peck, is then washed\r\nas above described, till a manageable quantity of sand is left. If there\r\nis any show of gold, dry the mass and put it in a bowl or glass dish,\r\nand add an ounce of quicksilver, stirring the mixture well with a wooden\r\nrod. The quicksilver, which will unite with every particle of gold which\r\nmay be there, is then poured off into a soft leather (chamois) bag. This\r\nis squeezed to remove superfluous quicksilver, and a pasty amalgam is\r\nleft, which is put into an iron vessel and heated red hot. The yellow\r\npowder remaining is mixed with saltpetre and melted, when a button of\r\npure gold will be found in the crucible. Quartz ores should yield $6 to\r\nthe ton in order to pay.\r\n\r\nTo test pyrites for gold, reduce a given quantity to powder and wash as\r\nbefore; then roast the residue at a red heat. Upon cooling, add\r\nquicksilver and treat as just described. Pyrites should yield $1 of\r\ngold to the bushel of ore to be profitable.\r\n\r\nNative silver often contains gold. To separate them, carefully flatten\r\nthe alloy with a smooth hammer on an anvil, and then boil it in strong\r\nnitric acid in a glass flask for about ten minutes. Carefully pour off\r\nthe acid into a vial, and wash the powder in the flask (which is fine\r\ngold) with water and dry. To the liquid in the vial add a solution of\r\ncommon salt. The white powder which falls should be removed, washed with\r\nwater, and fused with powdered chalk or iron filings; a button of pure\r\nsilver is the result.\r\n\r\nAny substance supposed to be or to contain gold may be tested by\r\ndissolving it powdered in aqua regia and then pouring in a solution of\r\ncopperas; if there is gold, the reddish-brown precipitate, by rubbing,\r\nassumes a bright metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nTo tell whether a globule of silver has any gold in it, put it on a\r\nwhite porcelain dish and moisten it with a drop of nitric acid: if it\r\nis pure silver, it will dissolve and retain its white color; if mixed\r\nwith gold, it will soon turn gray or black.\r\n\r\nTo test the purity of gold, rub some of it off on a hard black flint\r\nslate, and apply to the mark a drop of aqua fortis. If the gold is pure,\r\nthe yellow streak remains unchanged, but if alloyed it partly\r\ndisappears; if it is only an imitation of gold, it vanishes altogether.\r\n\r\nA ready method of finding the amount of gold in a quartz rock with\r\nconsiderable accuracy, is by taking the specific gravity of the rock\r\n(well cleaned) as given on page 13. If the gravity is not over 2.7, it\r\ncontains little or no gold. If it is 3, it very likely is gold-bearing,\r\nalthough pyrites may be present. But if it is over 5, it is undoubtedly\r\nauriferous, and if 12, it is very rich in gold.\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered that the sand of any river is worth working\r\nfor the gold it contains, provided it will yield twenty-four grains to\r\nthe hundred weight.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF SILVER ORE.--Pure silver is easily recognized. But lead and\r\ncopper ores often contain a large percentage of the precious metal.\r\n\r\nTo detect silver in lead ore, dissolve the powdered ore in strong nitric\r\nacid; pour off the liquid and insert a piece of pure copper. If silver\r\nis present, it will go to the bottom. Or, add to the liquid a solution\r\nof common salt, and it will instantly become cloudy or white. If lead\r\nore yields three ounces of silver to a ton, it may be worked for the\r\nsilver as well as the lead. In Colorado, the average value of\r\nsilver-bearing galena is $100 per ton.\r\n\r\nTo test the copper ores for silver, dissolve them in nitric acid; then\r\nadd a few drops of muriatic acid, and if silver is present, a white\r\ncurdy precipitate will fall to the bottom. Native copper, when polished,\r\noften shows white spots of silver.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the proportion of silver in lead ore, reduce a known\r\nquantity of the clear ore to powder, mix with a little dry soda and a\r\nfew nails, and heat in a round-bottomed iron pot or crucible. The lead\r\nwhich is obtained should then be put in a cup having ashes at the\r\nbottom, and strongly heated in an open furnace. A globule of silver will\r\nbe left, if any is present, and being weighed, the percentage can be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nRich silver ores may be reduced by mixing them with ten parts of common\r\nsalt, and exposing the mass for hours in an open furnace, stirring it\r\nfrequently. When cold reduce to powder and mix with an equal quantity of\r\nquicksilver and enough water to make a paste, and agitate the mixture\r\nfor two days, when the amalgam will fall to the bottom. The amalgam is\r\nthen squeezed in a leather bag and washed.\r\n\r\nSilver glance will yield its metal by heating it before a blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF COPPER ORE.--When the ore is native copper and rock, as at Lake\r\nSuperior, it should be pounded and the earthy matter washed away. Then\r\nmix with a little potash or soda and bring to a high heat in a\r\ncrucible.\r\n\r\nOther copper ores may be tested by dissolving them powdered in dilute\r\naqua regia. The presence of silver will be shown by a white powder on\r\nthe bottom. Then add considerable ammonia. If there is any copper a blue\r\nliquor will be produced. Strain this through tissue paper, and evaporate\r\nto dryness. Dissolve the residue in muriatic acid, and by putting in a\r\npiece of iron or zinc, the copper will fall down. Or, add to this\r\nsolution pure potash; dry and weigh the powder thrown down; every 5\r\nparts of it contains 4 parts of copper.\r\n\r\nGray copper and red copper ores may be assayed by heating with charcoal,\r\n(both powdered,) in a furnace. Malachite and azurite should be smelted\r\nwith borax; Copper pyrites and silicate of copper with soda or powdered\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nA ton of copper ore which contains ten per cent. of metal, pays $25 at\r\nthe furnace. The ore of copper when roasted, turns black; and when\r\nthrown into nitric acid makes a sky-blue solution. A clean knife-blade\r\nput into this solution will be coated with copper.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF IRON ORE.--Take a known quantity of the ore in fine powder and\r\nmix thoroughly with dry borax (or with one part of fluor spar, one of\r\ncharcoal and four of salt,) and expose it for an hour in a covered\r\ncrucible lined with charcoal to a white heat in a wind-furnace for an\r\nhour. A button of iron will be found at the bottom, which determines the\r\npercentage.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF ZINC ORE.--If the weighed ore is roasted with powdered\r\ncharcoal, white flowers of zinc will be formed on a piece of cold iron\r\nheld over it. After thorough roasting, the residue should be weighed;\r\nthe loss is the oxide of zinc, and every 100 parts of this contain 81 of\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nAll the ores of zinc will dissolve in either nitric or hot sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF TIN ORE.--Tin-stone will yield up its metal if mixed with\r\ncharcoal, borax and soda, and heated on the hearth of a furnace or\r\nbefore a blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nThe presence of tin may be tested by dissolving the metal thus roasted\r\nout, in aqua regia and adding a decoction of Brazil-wood: if the metal\r\nwas tin, the liquid will be colored a beautiful crimson.\r\n\r\nASSAY OF LEAD ORE.--Both galena and cerussite are rich ores, and when\r\nabundant pay well. They are easily reduced by heat, the former being\r\nusually mixed with charcoal and iron filings. If a western backwoodsman\r\nwants shot or bullets, he kindles a fire in a hollow tree or an old\r\nstump, puts some galena on the charred wood, and melts it down. After\r\ncooling, he finds the metal at the bottom. The smelting of a ton of lead\r\ncosts about $6. The average price per ton of galena is $30. When galena\r\nis dissolved in warm nitric acid, a clean plate of zinc placed in it\r\nwill be coated with brilliant blades of lead; if the galena contains\r\nsilver, a plate of copper will be served in the same way. A solution of\r\nchromate of potash poured into a solution of lead ore in nitric acid\r\nwill throw down a yellow powder.\r\n\r\nTO TEST THE PURITY OF GRAPHITE.--Its value depends upon the amount of\r\nits carbon. Pulverize and then dry at a heat of about 350 degrees,\r\ntwenty grains of it; then place it in a tube of hard glass four or five\r\ninches long, half an inch wide and closed at one end. Add twenty times\r\nas much well dried oxide of lead and well mix. Weigh the tube and\r\ncontents, and afterwards heat before a blow-pipe till the contents are\r\ncompletely fused and no longer evolve gases. Ten minutes will suffice\r\nfor this. Allow the tube to cool and weigh it. The loss in weight is\r\ncarbonic acid. For every twenty-eight parts of loss there must have been\r\ntwelve of carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMINERAL SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n     WHAT ARE MINERAL SPRINGS--GENERAL LOCATION--GAS SPRINGS--IRON\r\n     SPRINGS--SULPHUR SPRINGS--ALUM SPRINGS--EPSOM SPRINGS--SALT\r\n     SPRINGS--WARM SPRINGS--ARTESIAN WELLS AND OIL WELLS, AND WHERE TO\r\n     BORE FOR THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny spring which contains a large amount of foreign matter, as gas,\r\nsalts and earthy ingredients, is called _mineral water_. The special\r\nprominence of any ingredient gives it its particular name. Many iron\r\nsprings contain salt, salt springs contain iron, and both may contain\r\ngas; the name is derived from the most prominent ingredient.\r\n\r\nOur country is rich in mineral springs; there is not a State without\r\none. But in general they are most numerous in hilly or mountainous\r\nregions, especially where the rocks are much deranged in position, or\r\n“faulted,” as the miners say. As for example, in Eastern New York and in\r\nthe valley between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany from Harper’s Ferry\r\nto the Natural Bridge. The Pacific States, also, are as remarkable for\r\nthe number and variety of their mineral springs as for their metallic\r\nores.\r\n\r\nCARBONATED OR GAS SPRINGS.--Springs of this class have a peculiar\r\nsparkling character and are continually sending up bubbles of gas. When\r\nthe quantity of gas is small, it may be detected by adding a little lime\r\nwater which will give it a milky appearance and deposit a white\r\nsediment; or, dip in a piece of blue litmus paper (which can be had of\r\nmost druggists), and if there is any carbonic acid gas in the water, it\r\nwill be reddened; or, pour in a little vinegar, stir well, and then add\r\na little finely powdered sugar, when the gas, if it is there, will rise\r\nin small bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated carbonated springs are the following: Saratoga and\r\nBallston, N. Y.; Clarendon, Vt.; Sweet Springs in Shover’s Valley, Pa.;\r\nBladon and Bailey Springs, Ala.; “Boiling Springs” near Pike’s Peak,\r\nCol.; Beer Springs near Bear River, Or. These springs contain salt,\r\nsoda, magnesia, lime and iron, and are sometimes classed as _saline_,\r\n_soda_ or _chalybeate_ springs.\r\n\r\nCHALYBEATE OR IRON SPRINGS.--The presence of iron in a spring may be\r\nascertained by pouring into it an infusion of nut-galls, of logwood or\r\nof tan-bark, which will change it immediately to a black or dark color.\r\nIf the water contains much iron, it may be recognized by its inky taste\r\nand by a yellowish powder on the border of the spring or at the bottom\r\nof a tumbler when allowed to stand awhile.\r\n\r\nIf waters have a cool but earthy taste, they contain lime; if bitter,\r\nthey have magnesia. The “soda springs,” so called, are often only\r\nsaline, carbonated or magnesia waters.\r\n\r\nThe most famous iron springs are at Saratoga, Sandlake and Catskill, N.\r\nY.; West Bethel, Fryeburg, Eberne and Bethel, Me.; Schooley’s Mountain\r\nin Washington, N. J.; Bedford, Pittsburg, Frankfort and York, Pa.;\r\nBrandywine Springs, Del.; Red Sweet Springs in Monroe County, Rawley’s\r\nSpring in Rockingham County, and Huguenot Springs in Powhattan County,\r\nVa.; in Bath County, Ky.; Yellow Springs, O.; twenty miles east of\r\nKnoxville, Tenn.; Madison County, Geo.; Raymond and Lynchburg, Miss.;\r\nnear Ogden City, Utah; near Mt. Shasta, Col.\r\n\r\nSULPHUR SPRINGS.--These are easily recognized by their unpleasant odor,\r\nresembling that of rotten eggs. The water blackens silver and a solution\r\nof sugar of lead.\r\n\r\nSulphur springs are very numerous. The best known are at Saratoga,\r\nSharon, Clifton, Avon, Manlius, Chittenango, Dryden and Richfield, N.\r\nY.; Highgate and Newburg, Vt.; Togus, Bethel and West Newfield, Me.;\r\nShover’s Valley, Carlisle and Doubling Gap, Pa.; Winchester and\r\nWarrenton, Va.; Greenbrier and Monroe Counties, W. Va.; Bath County,\r\nKy.; White’s Creek near Nashville and in Granger County, Tenn.;\r\nSpartanburg, S. C.; Butts County, Geo.; Tallahatta, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.;\r\nnear Bitter Creek and Great Salt Lake, Utah; along the Yellowstone\r\nRiver, Mont.; Jackson, Cal.\r\n\r\nACID OR ALUM SPRINGS.--These waters have a more or less sour taste and\r\nredden blue litmus-paper.\r\n\r\nThey are found at Byron and Oak Orchard, N. Y.; Blossburg, Pa.; Bath,\r\nRichmond and Rockbridge, Va.\r\n\r\nMAGNESIAN OR EPSOM SPRINGS.--These have a bitter taste. To test any\r\nwater for magnesia, add to a glass of it a solution of phosphate of soda\r\nand some hartshorn; if magnesia is present, the liquid first becomes\r\nturbid, and finally minute crystals fall to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere are Epsom springs at Harrodsburg and Perryville, Ky.; Westport,\r\nO.; Raymond, Miss.; Orange County, Ind.; Scott County, W. Va.\r\n\r\nSALINE OR SALT SPRINGS.--These contain a large percentage of common\r\nsalt, and are recognized by their taste. They generally contain many\r\ningredients, (generally seven or eight,) but the salt predominates. A\r\nwell should contain at least ten per cent. of salt to pay for working.\r\nThe Syracuse spring yields a bushel of salt to every thirty-three\r\ngallons; while the Great Salt Lake contains 22 per cent. Among the most\r\nimportant salt wells are those at Syracuse, Salina and Liverpool, N. Y.;\r\nLubec, Me.; Shannondale, Va.; Bath County, Ky.; Athens County, O.;\r\nHartford, Ind.; Saginaw, Mich.; Oneida, Idaho.\r\n\r\nTHERMAL OR WARM SPRINGS.--Any spring is so called, the temperature of\r\nwhich throughout the year is above that of the soil around it. They\r\ngenerally occur near the line of junction between the granite or igneous\r\nrocks and the stratified rock (slate or limestone) resting upon its\r\nflanks. The temperature of such waters in the United States ranges from\r\n73 to 200 degrees, the latter being reached by the Geysers of Montana.\r\nMany iron and sulphur springs are also thermal.\r\n\r\nThe most noted warm springs are at Lebanon, N. Y.; in Bath, Berkley,\r\nMonroe and Scott Counties, Va.; Buncombe Counties, N. C.; French Brood\r\nRiver, Tenn.; Meriwether County, Geo.; Washitaw, Ark.; Salt Lake Valley,\r\nUtah; near Pyramid Lake, Nev.; along the Malheur and Fall Rivers, Or.;\r\nLincoln Valley, Idaho; on Gardiner’s River, in Madison County, and\r\nespecially in the Yellowstone Basin, Mont.\r\n\r\nARTESIAN WELLS.--To sink a flowing well with any reasonable prospect of\r\nsuccess, it is essential that the spot selected should be lower than\r\nland in the vicinity, although those higher elevations may be several\r\nmiles away. The layers of the rocks, also, should dip _towards_ the spot\r\nrather than away from it. The best indication, but not a certain one, is\r\na _great_ basin-shaped valley, to the centre of which the rocks dip on\r\none or more sides. Sandy, lime and slate rocks are more propitious than\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nOIL WELLS.--Where there are marks of disturbance and misplacement of the\r\nrocks, there the experienced sink wells. Rugged hills and\r\nsharply-defined valleys are, generally, signs of such dislocation. The\r\nline or “break” from which the rocks dip like the roof of a house is\r\nconsidered most favorable. There is no such thing as an “oil rock,” for\r\nthe oil is found at different depths, and the fissure containing it is\r\nmore or less vertical. In Pennsylvania, the greatest flowing wells have\r\nbeen found in the third sand rock. No limestone has afforded any large\r\nsupply of oil. Coal in no large quantities is ever found upon or in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the oil territory. The “show of oil” increases in\r\nvalue as a sign, with the depth at which it is found. Especially is the\r\nfinding of a large amount of imprisoned gas, though no oil may be\r\npresent, regarded as a good indication that oil is near. In the\r\nbituminous coal region, a gas spring indicates the probable existence of\r\noil in the rocks below. But generally, “surface shows” are seductive.\r\nThe great oil belt runs south-westerly from Oil Creek, Pa., to Burning\r\nSprings, West Va. But Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMissouri, Texas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Southern California are\r\nalso rich in petroleum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL JEWELRY--HOW MADE AND HOW DETECTED.\r\n\r\n     MOCK DIAMONDS--“PARIS BRILLIANTS”--THE MANUFACTURE OF PASTES--FALSE\r\n     RUBY, TOPAZ, SAPPHIRE, EMERALD AND CARNELIAN--HOW TO DISTINGUISH\r\n     TRUE AND FALSE GEMS--IMITATION PEARL AND CORAL--ARTIFICIAL\r\n     GOLD--LIST OF PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Bristol Stones,” “Irish Diamonds,” “Cape May Diamonds,” and “California\r\nDiamonds,” are skillfully-cut quartz crystals. They are easily detected\r\nby the file and by their lightness.\r\n\r\n“Paris Brilliants” are more dangerous counterfeits, and are very often\r\nsold for genuine. The great establishment of Boarguiguon, in Paris, is\r\nthe most famous manufactory of artificial gems in the world, employing\r\nabout one hundred hands. The gems are such perfect imitations that they\r\ncan be distinguished from real stones only by the closest scrutiny of\r\nthose experienced in such matters. They fail chiefly in hardness; in\r\nbrilliancy and gravity they nearly or quite equal the genuine.\r\n\r\nNature has made the most precious stones with the most common materials.\r\nThe diamond is purified charcoal; while the matter of clay and white\r\npebbles is the base of all other gems.\r\n\r\nThe chemist has imitated nature in the production of colored gems. The\r\nbase of these imitations, called “pastes,” is “_strass_”--a white glass\r\ncompound of 300 parts of pure sand, 96 of potash, 27 of borax, 514 of\r\nwhite lead, and one of arsenic. The mixture is put into a crucible and\r\nkept at a high heat for 24 hours. This is the philosopher’s stone which\r\ncompetes with Golconda. The uncolored glass is used in making mock\r\ndiamonds and white topaz. Another paste which has very great brilliancy,\r\nand, unfortunately, the same gravity as the diamond, is made by melting\r\n100 parts of pure sand, 150 of red lead, 30 of calcined potash, 10 of\r\ncalcined borax and one of arsenic, keeping the mixture melted for two or\r\nthree days and then cooling very slowly. Each ingredient is separately\r\nreduced to a fine powder.\r\n\r\nFALSE RUBY is made by fusing together of strass one ounce and six drams,\r\nglass of antimony 37 grains, and purple of cassius one grain; then add\r\neight parts more of strass and fuse for thirty hours; cool and remelt\r\npieces in a blow-pipe. Or, melt five ounces of strass and one dram of\r\nmanganese.\r\n\r\nFALSE TOPAZ can be made from 1008 grains of strass, 43 grains of glass\r\nof antimony and one grain of purple of cassius.\r\n\r\nFALSE SAPPHIRE.--Add to eight ounces of strass 52 grains of pure oxide\r\nof cobalt.\r\n\r\nFALSE EMERALD.--To one pound of strass add one dram of verdigris and\r\nfifteen grains of crocus martis. Or, take 2304 grains of strass, 21\r\ngrains of green oxide of copper, and one grain of oxide of chrome. Or,\r\ntake an ounce and a half of rock-crystal, six drams of dry soda, two\r\ndrams of dry borax, two drams of red lead, one dram of nitre, twenty\r\ngrains of red oxide of iron, and ten grains of green carbonate of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nFALSE CARNELIAN.--Strass two pounds, glass of antimony one pound, rouge\r\ntwo ounces, manganese one dram.\r\n\r\nFALSE AMETHYSTS AND OPALS are manufactured; but the fine opal defies\r\nimitation, and the amethyst is too common in nature to allow much margin\r\nfor the “pastes.”\r\n\r\nIn distinguishing true and false gems, no one character should be\r\ndepended upon. All genuine stones will bear rough handling; if the\r\nmerchant says “hands off,” refuse to purchase. Any gem worth buying is\r\nworth testing.\r\n\r\nFirst: try the _hardness_. The file will make no impression on the\r\ndiamond and ruby, and will with difficulty scratch the other gems; while\r\nthe “pastes” are easily marred. All the precious stones scratch window\r\nglass, although opal will not attack common bottle glass. All imitations\r\neasily yield to sand. The sapphire is the hardest of colored gems, and\r\nopal is the softest. The emerald will hardly scratch rock-crystal; its\r\ncounterfeit not at all. Topaz will scratch ordinary ruby, but will not\r\ntouch sapphire.\r\n\r\nSecondly: as to _weight_. This is the most accurate method, but the\r\nstone must be taken from its setting. The mode of taking the gravity has\r\nalready been given (page 13), and the amount of each is stated in\r\nChapter II. Garnet is the heaviest of gems; weighed in water it loses\r\nonly one-fourth of its weight; _i. e._, if a red garnet be suspended by\r\na fine thread from a delicate balance and immersed in a glass of water\r\nunder it, one-quarter of its ordinary weight in air must be added to the\r\npan from which it is suspended to restore the equilibrium. In like\r\nmanner, ruby and sapphire lose a little more. The diamond and white\r\ntopaz lose two-sevenths of their weight. Rock-crystal, amethyst,\r\ncarnelian and agate lose five-thirteenths; and opal about one-half,\r\nbeing the lightest of gems. The emerald loses more than one-third.\r\n\r\nAs “paste” _can_ be made so as to have the same specific gravity as the\r\ngenuine article, this test alone can not be relied upon; but very few of\r\nthe imitations are so carefully made. The test is very convenient in\r\ndistinguishing gems of like color from each other, as oriental ruby,\r\nspinel ruby and red tourmaline, and green tourmaline and emerald.\r\n\r\nThirdly: characteristics depending on _light_ and _electricity_. It is\r\nnot easy to look through a diamond of the first water, while imitations\r\nreadily permit objects to be seen through them. A very delicate and\r\nperfect test of a diamond, distinguishing it from all colorless gems, as\r\nwhite topaz, white sapphire and white zircon, but not from “pastes,” is\r\nto look through it at a pin-hole in a card. This requires some\r\ndexterity, and the gem should be fixed to a steady object by a bit of\r\nwax at a proper distance. A true diamond will show but one hole, all the\r\nothers will show two. As white topaz, when large, is a magnificent\r\nstone, it is often palmed off for a diamond of great value; but this\r\ntest is invariably certain.\r\n\r\nA true diamond retains its brilliancy under water.\r\n\r\nWhen a colored stone is placed in the path of the solar spectrum (the\r\nrow of seven colors into which sunlight is separated by a prism), its\r\ncolor will vary with the portion of the spectrum which falls upon it;\r\nand two stones of the same color, but of a different nature, will\r\nexhibit different effects. Thus, a paste placed beside a fine colored\r\ngem, betrays its worthlessness. A simpler method of testing stones is to\r\nlook at them through a bit of glass, colored red, yellow, blue or green.\r\nEvery stone will exhibit, under this test, properties peculiar to\r\nitself, and by which its\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEARCHING FOR DIAMONDS.]\r\n\r\nnature may be recognized. This is also a severe test for the purity of\r\ntint; for if pure and unmixed, the stone will appear completely black in\r\nevery other light but its own color. Milky and turbid stones can not\r\nbear this test.\r\n\r\nA first-class ruby has the color of the blood as it spirts from an\r\nartery. The deeper the hue of the emerald the more it is valued; it\r\nloses none of its brilliancy by artificial light. The pale rose topaz,\r\nthe kind most esteemed, is artificially colored by heating it.\r\n\r\nIf topaz or tourmaline be gently heated, it becomes electric and will\r\nattract a thread or suspended pith-ball. No imitation will do this. All\r\nreal gems when rubbed will attract the pith-ball, and retain the power a\r\nlong time; the pastes also become electric, but soon lose their\r\nattraction. Rub a glass tube with a piece of flannel and bring it near a\r\nsuspended pith-ball; the latter will be strongly attracted and then\r\nrepelled. Immediately rub a genuine diamond and bring it near the ball,\r\nand it will be attracted. A paste diamond thus rubbed would repel it.\r\n\r\nFinally: the breath remains much longer on the pastes than on real gems.\r\nThe former also betray under a magnifying glass small air bubbles.\r\nDiamonds and other first-class stones are always cold to the touch.\r\n\r\nFALSE PEARLS.--These are glass beads coated with a mixture of three\r\nounces of scales of the blay or bleak fish, half an ounce of fine glue,\r\none ounce of white wax and one ounce of pulverized alabaster. Powdered\r\nopal is sometimes used; also the powdered pearl of the oyster and other\r\nshells soaked in vinegar, and made up with gum tragacanth. Artificial\r\npearls are usually brittle, and do not weigh more than two-thirds as\r\nmuch as the genuine.\r\n\r\nFALSE CORALS.--These are made of resin and vermilion; or of marble\r\npowder made into a paste with varnish or soluble glass and a little\r\nisinglass, colored by Chinese vermilion, and then moulded. They are\r\nused for setting in cheap jewelry. The knife shows it to be too soft to\r\nbe genuine.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL GOLD.--The following oroid or imitation gold is sometimes\r\nsold for the genuine article which it closely resembles. Pure copper,\r\n100 parts by weight, is melted in a crucible, and then 6 parts of\r\nmagnesia, 3.6 of sal-ammoniac, 1.8 of quicklime and 9. of tartar are\r\nadded separately and gradually in the form of powder. The whole is then\r\nstirred for about half an hour, and 17 parts of zinc or tin in small\r\ngrains are thrown in and thoroughly mixed. The crucible is now covered\r\nand the mixture kept melted for half an hour longer, when it is skimmed\r\nand poured out.\r\n\r\nAny imitation of gold may be detected by its weight, which is not\r\none-half of what it should be, and by its dissolving in nitric acid\r\nwhile pure gold is untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\nARRANGED ACCORDING TO COLOR AND IN ORDER OF HARDNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limpid._\r\n\r\nDiamond,\r\nSapphire,\r\nTopaz,\r\nRock-Crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blue._\r\n\r\nSapphire,\r\nTopaz,\r\nSpinel,\r\nAquamarine,\r\nIndicolite,\r\nTurquoise,\r\nKyanite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green._\r\n\r\nOriental Emerald,\r\nChrysoberyl,\r\nEmerald,\r\nChrysoprase,\r\nChrysolite,\r\nAmazon Stone,\r\nMalachite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yellow._\r\n\r\nDiamond,\r\nTopaz,\r\nFire-Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Red._\r\n\r\nSapphire-Ruby,\r\nSpinel-Ruby,\r\nBrazilian-Topaz,\r\nHyacinth,\r\nCarnelian,\r\nRubellite,\r\nGarnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Violet._\r\n\r\nOriental Amethyst,\r\nAmethyst.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black and Brown._\r\n\r\nDiamond,\r\nTourmaline,\r\nHyacinth,\r\nGarnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the 19th day of January, 1848, that James W. Marshall, while\r\nengaged in digging a race for a saw-mill at Coloma, about thirty-five\r\nmiles eastward from Sutter’s Fort, found some pieces of yellow metal,\r\nwhich he and the half-dozen men working with him at the mill supposed to\r\nbe gold. He felt confident that he had made a discovery of great\r\nimportance, but he knew nothing of either chemistry or gold-mining, so\r\nhe could not prove the nature of the metal nor tell how to obtain it in\r\npaying quantities. Every morning he went down to the race to look for\r\nthe bits of the metal; but the other men at the mill thought Marshall\r\nwas very wild in his ideas, and they continued their labors in building\r\nthe mill, and in sowing wheat and planting vegetables. The swift current\r\nof the mill-race washed away a considerable body of earthy matter,\r\nleaving the coarse particles of gold behind; so Marshall’s collection of\r\nspecimens continued to accumulate, and his associates began to think\r\nthere might be something in his gold mines after all. About the middle\r\nof February, a Mr. Bennet, one of the party employed at the mill, went\r\nto San Francisco for the purpose of learning whether this metal was\r\nprecious, and there he was introduced to Isaac Humphrey, who had washed\r\nfor gold in Georgia. The experienced miner saw at a glance that he had\r\nthe true stuff before him, and, after a few inquiries, he was satisfied\r\nthat the diggings must be rich. He made immediate preparation to go to\r\nthe mill, and tried\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAW-MILL OF COLOMA.\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE WHERE GOLD WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nto persuade some of his friends to go with him; but they thought it\r\nwould be only a waste of time and money, so he went with Bennet for his\r\nsole companion.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Coloma on the 7th of March, and found the work at the mill\r\ngoing on as if no gold existed in the neighborhood. The next day he took\r\na pan and spade, and washed some of the dirt in the bottom of the\r\nmill-race in places where Marshall had found his specimens, and, in a\r\nfew hours, Humphrey declared that these mines were far richer than any\r\nin Georgia. He now made a rocker and went to work washing gold\r\nindustriously, and every day yielded to him an ounce or two of metal.\r\nThe men at the mill made rockers for themselves, and all were soon busy\r\nin search of the yellow metal. Everything else was abandoned; the rumor\r\nof the discovery spread slowly. In the middle of March Pearson B.\r\nReading, the owner of a large ranch at the head of the Sacramento\r\nvalley, happened to visit Sutter’s Fort, and hearing of the mining at\r\nColoma, he went thither to see it. He said that if similarity of\r\nformation could be taken as a proof, there must be gold-mines near his\r\nranch; so, after observing the method of washing, he posted off, and in\r\na few weeks he was at work on the bars of Clear Creek, nearly two\r\nhundred miles north-westward from Coloma. A few days after Reading had\r\nleft, John Bidwell, now representative of the northern district of the\r\nState in the lower House of Congress, came to Coloma, and the result of\r\nhis visit was that, in less than a month, he had a party of Indians from\r\nhis ranch washing gold on the bars of Feather River, twenty-five miles\r\nnorth-westward from Coloma. Thus the mines were opened at far distant\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe first printed notice of the discovery of gold, was given in the\r\nCalifornia newspaper published in San Francisco on the 15th of March. On\r\nthe 29th of May the same paper, announcing that its publication would be\r\nsuspended, says:--“The whole country, from San Francisco to Los\r\nAngelos, and from the sea-shore to the base of the Sierra Nevada,\r\nresound with the sordid cry of _gold! gold! gold!_ while the field is\r\nleft half planted, the house half built, and everything neglected but\r\nthe manufacture of picks and shovels, and the means of transportation to\r\nthe spot where one man obtained one hundred and twenty-eight dollars’\r\nworth of the real stuff in one day’s washing; and the average for all\r\nconcerned, is twenty dollars per diem.”\r\n\r\nThe first to commence quartz mining in California were Capt. Wm. Jackson\r\nand Mr. Eliason, both Virginians, and the first machine used was a\r\nChilian mill.\r\n\r\nThe Reid Mine, in North Carolina, was the first gold mine discovered and\r\nworked in the United States, and the only one in North America from\r\nwhich, up to 1825, gold was sent to the Mint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     DISCOVERY OF SILVER IN NEVADA, AND UNITED STATES GOLD AND SILVER\r\n     STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparated from California by the snowy chain of the Sierra, the State of\r\nNevada has been celebrated, since 1860, for its silver mining. In\r\nNovember, 1859, the news of the discovery of silver mines near Lake\r\nWashoe was confirmed at San Francisco; and in June, 1860, the mines of\r\nWashoe, the central western portion of the State, had already sent such\r\nrich results to Europe, that the French Ministers of Finance and\r\nCommerce despatched a mining engineer to Nevada to make a close\r\ninspection of these wonderful mines. It seemed as if the world were\r\nabout to be inundated with silver, as it had been by gold ten years\r\npreviously; and what would those economists now say, who had only\r\nrecently counselled that the value of gold coin should be lowered or\r\nthat gold should be demonetized on account of the disturbed relation of\r\nthese precious metals--the bases of the standard of payment throughout\r\nthe world generally. Whilst the French engineer visited Nevada and\r\nprepared his report, the miners of Washoe continued working their veins\r\nof metal. At the present time, 1881, the mines on the eastern slope of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada annually produce about $12,500,000 of silver, chiefly\r\nfrom the Comstock lode; the total yield of gold from the quartz mines of\r\nCalifornia is about $17,000,000 per annum. The Comstock lode, in the\r\nState of Nevada, may be ranked among the most productive metalliferous\r\ndeposits ever encountered in the history of mining enterprise; its\r\nproductive capacity, as now being developed, surpassing, if the mass of\r\nits ores do not in richness equal, those of the most famous mines of\r\nMexico and Peru.\r\n\r\nThe known limits of this lode cover a space of 22,546 feet in a nearly\r\ndue north and south direction (magnetic). The variation of the needle in\r\nthat locality is 16½ degrees east. Upon this extensive seat of\r\nmetalliferous deposits, the mines are divided into three groups: the\r\nVirginia Group, seventeen mines, with claims of 13,549⅓ feet; Gold\r\nHill Group, nine mines, of 6,397¼ feet; American Flat Group, three\r\nmines, of 2,600 feet. The three groups of twenty-nine mines thus occupy\r\na total length on the lode of 22,546 feet. The Comstock lode was\r\ndiscovered in 1859, by a pit sunk for a water hole on the ground of the\r\nOphir mine; milling the ore began in October of the same year, but the\r\namount of bullion taken out in 1860 is estimated at but $100,000. Since\r\nthen the Comstock has become the greatest gold and silver mine in the\r\nworld. To the end of 1878 the yield was estimated at $291,162,205, as\r\nfollows: From 1860 to 1870 inclusive, of gold and silver together,\r\nunclassified, $102,466,240; 1871 to 1878 inclusive, gold, $88,691,498,\r\nsilver, $91,278,623; 1877 and 1878, gold and silver, unclassified,\r\n$1,725,844. Making allowance for the loss by slimes and tailings, the\r\ngross contents of the lode as worked up to 1878 are estimated at\r\n$363,961,205. About 6,500,000 tons of ore have been extracted in this\r\ntime, which a good authority estimates of an average value to the\r\ncompany of $45 per ton of 2,000 pounds.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL PRODUCTION
