When\r\nthe boys became married Dick Rover was blessed with a son and a\r\ndaughter, as was also his brother Sam, while Tom became the parent of a\r\nlively pair of twin boys.\r\n\r\nFrom their homes in New York City the four younger Rovers went to\r\nboarding school, as related in the first volume of the Second Series,\r\nentitled “The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.” From that school the scene was\r\nshifted to “Snowshoe Island” and then to doings while “Under Canvas.”\r\nThen the boys went “On a Hunt,” and, later, to “The Land of Luck.”\r\nThen came exciting days at “Big Horn Ranch” and at “Big Bear Lake,”\r\nwhere we last met them. In the present volume the scene is shifted to\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean. The boys were shipwrecked and had many thrilling\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nAs many of my readers know, the sale of this series of books is now\r\nwell past the _three million_ mark. To me, this seems truly wonderful.\r\nMy only hope is that the reading of these books will do all of the boys\r\nand girls good.\r\n\r\nAffectionately and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    EDWARD STRATEMEYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                       PAGE\r\n      I.

The scene was the campus of\r\nColby Hall Military Academy, and drawn up in front of the youthful\r\nmajor were the three companies of cadets. It was a clear day in\r\nNovember and the boys made an inspiring appearance in their well\r\nfitting uniforms. Every rifle was in the pink of condition, as were\r\nalso the drums, fifes and bugles of the musicians.\r\n\r\n“Present arms!” was the next command, and as the students held their\r\nrifles before them, Captain Mapes Dale, the military instructor, passed\r\nin front of one company after another. He was followed by Colonel Colby\r\nand Professor Grawson.\r\n\r\n“The cadets certainly make a fine showing,” remarked Colonel Colby,\r\nafter the brief inspection had come to an end.\r\n\r\n“They do indeed, Colonel,” answered Captain Dale. “They have never\r\nturned out better. We’ll have to congratulate Major Rover. He certainly\r\nkeeps the boys well in hand.”\r\n\r\nThe owner of the military academy and his aids came to the front once\r\nmore, and then Captain Dale nodded to the young major. This was a\r\nsignal that the youthful commander could now proceed with the usual\r\nmorning routine.\r\n\r\n“Shoulder arms! Forward march!” came the quick, clear command.\r\n\r\nThen the drums struck up, followed by the lively pipings of the fifes,\r\nand the three companies of cadets moved forward across the campus and\r\naround the school buildings, finally coming to a halt in front of the\r\nentrance to the mess hall. There the cadets broke ranks, placed away\r\ntheir guns, swords and other equipments, and piled into the mess hall,\r\nwhere all were speedily seated at the numerous dining tables.\r\n\r\n“That ends parading for some time to come,” remarked Captain Fred\r\nRover, of Company C.\r\n\r\n“And I’m not sorry,” returned Andy Rover, his cousin.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for the Thanksgiving holidays!” burst out Randy, Andy’s twin.\r\n“Won’t we have a dandy time at home?”\r\n\r\n“And don’t forget that invitation from Ralph Mason,” came from Jack.\r\n\r\n“Hoopla! Me for a life on the ocean wave!” burst out Andy. “Ralph says\r\nthat motor boat is a dandy.”\r\n\r\n“If only the weather stays clear!” said Fred, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Young gentlemen, a little less noise, please,” came from Professor\r\nSnopper Duke, who chanced to be at the head of the table at which the\r\nfour Rovers were seated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Sorry I spoke, sir,” mumbled Andy, and slyly put his tongue\r\nin one cheek, at which his twin brother and his cousins grinned.\r\n\r\nAll of the cadets were in high spirits, and with good reason――school\r\nwas to close that afternoon for the Thanksgiving holidays. Nearly\r\nall of the cadets were going either home or elsewhere, so that only\r\na handful would be left at the academy for ten days. Usually the\r\nThanksgiving recess was shorter, but Colonel Colby wished to take\r\nadvantage of the holidays by having some necessary repairs done to the\r\nmess hall ceiling, which was in danger of coming down.\r\n\r\nBefore Jack Rover had been elected major of the school battalion, Ralph\r\nMason had occupied that important position. Now Ralph had left Colby\r\nHall for good, but he still retained his affection for many of the\r\nlads there, and had invited the Rover boys and two of their chums, Gif\r\nGarrison and Dick Powell, to accompany him on a motor-boat trip from\r\nWoods Hole to Marthas Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod――the proposed\r\nouting, of course, being contingent upon the condition of the weather.\r\n\r\n“I only hope the folks at home won’t object to our taking that\r\nmotor-boat trip,” remarked Fred, after the meal was over and the boys\r\nwere preparing to go to their classrooms.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how they can object,” came from Randy. “It will be\r\nperfectly safe.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it will be safe,” returned his twin brother. “There won’t a\r\nthing happen to us.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s hope so, anyway,” said Jack. “We’ve had adventure enough.\r\nGracious, just look at what happened at Big Horn Ranch and at Big Bear\r\nLake! After all those doings, I’m willing to sit down and take it easy.”\r\n\r\n“No sitting down for me,” broke in Andy, and in high spirits he dropped\r\nhis school books and turned a cartwheel in the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Andy Rover, what do you mean by such conduct in the school building?”\r\ncame in a cold, clear-cut voice, and the boys saw Professor Duke\r\nstanding in a doorway close behind them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, excuse me, sir. I didn’t know any one was looking,” stammered the\r\nfun-loving Rover.\r\n\r\n“After this reserve your gymnastic exercises for the gymnasium,” was\r\nthe professor’s sarcastic command as he turned away.\r\n\r\n“My, but he’s a real sociable fellow!” was Randy’s whispered comment.\r\n\r\n“And we thought he had turned over a new leaf,” murmured Jack.\r\n\r\n“It must be bred in the bone,” was the way Fred expressed himself.\r\n\r\nThe gong was now sounding, and all of the cadets hurried to their\r\nvarious classrooms, and were soon deep in their studies or recitations.\r\nAlthough they liked fun, Andy and Randy especially, the Rovers knew\r\nthat they must make good records at the Academy, or otherwise there\r\nwould be trouble when they faced their fathers and mothers.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, the agony will be over by half-past two this afternoon,”\r\nremarked Andy to his brother, “and by four-thirty we’ll be on our way\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose the girls will be on hand?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Jack said Martha telephoned in early this morning. And she said\r\nshe might have a surprise.”\r\n\r\n“A surprise?” came from Fred. “How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Martha wouldn’t say, because, she said, the whole thing might fall\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonder Jack didn’t make her tell! What do you suppose those\r\ngirls have up their sleeve?”\r\n\r\n“Search me! You can’t make Martha open her mouth when she wants to\r\nkeep silent. She’s not one of the kind of girls to tell everything she\r\nknows.”\r\n\r\n“Did she say Mary was in on the secret?” questioned Fred. Mary was his\r\nsister, and the two girls attended Clearwater Hall, a school for girls\r\nin that vicinity.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t say a word about Mary,” put in Jack, thus appealed to.\r\n\r\n“Maybe she didn’t say anything about Ruth Stevenson, either?” came from\r\nAndy, slyly, and his manner was such that the young major found himself\r\nblushing in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see what’s doing,” sighed\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\nThe last day in school before a holiday is usually not so strictly\r\nobserved as some others. The cadets, however, had to go through their\r\nusual recitations, interrupted only by the time taken for lunch. Then\r\nat half-past two the dismissal bell rang, and the cadets rushed hither\r\nand thither in their anxiety to pack and get away.\r\n\r\n“Look at the autos outside, will you?” came from Gif Garrison, who had\r\nstopped to speak to Jack about the proposed trip with Ralph Mason.\r\n“I’ll say some fellows are in luck.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed!” came from Dick Powell, usually called Spouter by his\r\nchums. “I’d rather ride in an auto ten times over than in a stuffy\r\ntrain. Just think of rolling along through the country with all the\r\nfoliage at its very best. Think of the trees tipped with crimson and\r\ngold, the mountainsides looking like――――”\r\n\r\n“There, Spouter, that will do for the present,” interrupted Jack,\r\ngood-naturedly. “You can spout all you please about the scenery when we\r\nare off on our trip.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pshaw! you fellows have no eye for beauty,” grumbled Spouter, in\r\ndisgust. “I don’t believe you know whether the tree leaves are red,\r\nyellow, green or pink.”\r\n\r\n“Hi there, Jack! Come here!” came in a yell from Fred, who had run out\r\non the campus. “Here’s a surprise!”\r\n\r\nJack broke away from a number of his friends and ran down to where Fred\r\nwas standing. The two Rovers were quickly joined by Andy and Randy.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s dad!” came from Andy. “Dad and Uncle Sam!”\r\n\r\n“And they’ve got the two autos with them!” answered his twin, dancing\r\nup and down in excitement.\r\n\r\n“Say, was that the secret Martha was keeping?” demanded Jack, rushing\r\nup and shaking his two uncles by the hand. And then, before they could\r\nanswer, he went on: “Where’s my dad? Why didn’t he come?”\r\n\r\n“Your father had to remain in New York,” answered Tom Rover. “Somebody\r\nhas to run the business, you know. We can’t all go holidaying,” and his\r\neyes twinkled, showing that he was just as full of fun as he had been\r\nwhen at the age of his twin sons.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we telephoned to Martha. But we told her to keep it a secret\r\nbecause we were afraid that something might hold us back,” explained\r\nSam Rover.\r\n\r\n“Why, Dad, you’ve got a new car!” burst out Fred. “What do you know\r\nabout that! Some swell outfit, I’ll say,” he added, gazing at the new\r\nautomobile admiringly. It was a big twelve-cylinder sedan, and looked\r\nto be the acme of comfort and mechanical perfection.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the boys learned that they were to leave the school by\r\nautomobile and pick up the two Rover girls at Clearwater Hall on the\r\nway. Ruth Stevenson was to accompany Martha and Mary.\r\n\r\n“Martha said Ruth’s folks are away on a tour,” explained Tom Rover. “So\r\nshe is to spend the holidays with us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that will suit Jack all right enough,” said Randy quickly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you all like Ruth?” demanded the young major.\r\n\r\n“Sure, we do!” came promptly from the others, and then, somehow, Jack\r\nfelt better.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t heard all of the secret yet,” Tom Rover said, grinning at\r\nhis twin sons and his two nephews. “Shall I tell them?” he went on,\r\nturning to his brother Sam.\r\n\r\n“Why not let them find it out for themselves?” came quickly from Fred’s\r\nfather. And then, turning to the lads, he continued: “You don’t know\r\nwhere you are going, boys, but you’re on the way.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that we’re not going home?” came from all four\r\ncadets in a chorus of wonder.\r\n\r\n“You are not,” replied Tom Rover. “But don’t ask any more questions. Go\r\nahead and get ready to leave. We have a long ride ahead of us, and we\r\ndon’t want to drive any farther than is necessary after dark.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Rover boys were saying good-bye to their chums and getting\r\nready to make the trip, Tom Rover and his brother Sam went in to call\r\non their old school chum, Colonel Colby.\r\n\r\n“It’s a touch of old times to see you fellows again,” said Larry Colby,\r\nas he shook hands warmly. “It’s too bad Dick didn’t come with you. Then\r\nwe’d have the old quartette,” and he smiled broadly.\r\n\r\n“Well, time is bound to scatter us,” remarked Sam Rover. “Some of the\r\nfellows are scattered to the four quarters of the globe. About all\r\nthe old crowd I ever see are Songbird Powell, Fred Garrison and Hans\r\nMueller.”\r\n\r\nKnowing that they had a long run ahead of them, the Rover boys lost no\r\ntime in getting ready for the trip. Then their suitcases were stowed\r\naway and they climbed into the two cars, the twins with their father\r\nand the others with Sam Rover.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to run to Haven Point and then along the lake to\r\nClearwater Hall. Here they found a number of automobiles parked along\r\nthe campus and many girl students coming and going.\r\n\r\n“There they are!” called out Jack, and waved his hand. In a moment more\r\nhis sister Martha came running toward them, followed by Mary Rover and\r\nRuth Stevenson.\r\n\r\n“How about the surprise, Jack?” cried Martha, her face beaming.\r\n\r\n“Peachy!” answered her brother, promptly. “Couldn’t be better!”\r\n\r\n“Did you suspect?” questioned Mary.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. We thought the folks were all too busy in Wall Street to\r\ncome up here just now.”\r\n\r\n“Hold on! Hold on!” interrupted Sam Rover. “They don’t know where\r\nthey’re going yet. Don’t spoil things.”\r\n\r\n“They don’t!” burst out Mary. “Why, I thought――――”\r\n\r\n“No, that’s to be a surprise,” said Tom Rover. “Don’t tell them a word.\r\nLet them find out for themselves. It will give them something to think\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this certainly is a mystery,” murmured Fred, and he and his\r\ncousins looked blankly at each other.\r\n\r\n“It was splendid to invite me to go along,” remarked Ruth Stevenson,\r\nas she shook hands warmly with the young major and the others. “Just\r\nsplendid!”\r\n\r\n“We’re glad to have you, Ruth,” answered Sam Rover.\r\n\r\nThe boys assisted the girls with their luggage, and a few minutes later\r\nthe automobile trip was begun. The twins rode with their father, and\r\nMary and Fred went with them, while Jack and Martha, accompanied by\r\nRuth, rode with their Uncle Sam. As was to be expected, Tom Rover led\r\nthe way and set such a pace that his brother had hard work to keep up\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n“We figured out that we could reach a town called Bridgeville in time\r\nfor supper,” said Sam Rover. “But I rather think we’ll have to hump\r\nourselves to do it.”\r\n\r\n“I guess Uncle Tom is going to try to put one over on you, Uncle Sam,”\r\nremarked Jack. “Maybe he wants to show you that his old car can outrun\r\nyour new one.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, if he doesn’t get into trouble,” answered Sam Rover.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t mind riding fast,” came from Ruth, her eyes sparkling with\r\nexcitement. “It’s so good to be out of school once more!”\r\n\r\n“Wish we were bound for Big Bear Lake,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jack, wouldn’t that be grand!”\r\n\r\n“It would be unless some big bear came along to eat us up,” put in\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we killed off all the bears,” said Jack. And this remark made both\r\nof the girls giggle.\r\n\r\nOn and on sped the two cars, keeping just within sight of each other.\r\nUp hill and down hill they rolled, around broad curves, and over solid\r\nstone bridges and some that were built of wood and rattled loudly as\r\nthey passed. The weather was so warm that they had all the windows\r\ndown, so they could enjoy the fresh air to its fullest.\r\n\r\n“Where do you suppose they are taking us?” whispered Randy to his\r\nbrother, as they rolled swiftly along.\r\n\r\n“Search me!” was the slangy answer. “They’ve certainly got something up\r\ntheir sleeve. I thought sure we were going home.”\r\n\r\n“So did I.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the car guided by Sam Rover struck a broad curve leading to\r\nthe left. A little farther on there was a crossroad, and presently\r\nthrough the trees and bushes Fred’s father caught sight of a long, low,\r\nyellow car on the other highway. As this car was coming from his right,\r\nhe at once slackened his pace and blew his horn vigorously.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the other car paid not the slightest attention to the\r\nwarning, but kept on, faster, if possible, than ever. As a consequence,\r\nSam Rover had to jam on the brakes. Then, as he came still closer to\r\nthe crossroads, he prepared to make the turn and run, if possible,\r\nwith the other car. Then came a wild tooting of the other horn, and\r\nthe yellow car attempted to make a turn to the right to get into the\r\nhighway on which the Rovers were running.\r\n\r\nBut this turn proved disastrous, and in a twinkling the yellow car\r\nrolled over and over, landing in some bushes on the side of the road.\r\nThe Rovers’ car proceeded a distance of fifty yards on the crossroad,\r\nand then came to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                    SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THE ROVERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, look at that auto!”\r\n\r\n“It turned over and over!”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose they are killed?”\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the cries that came from the occupants of Sam Rover’s\r\ncar as the machine came to a standstill. In the meanwhile the car run\r\nby Tom Rover had disappeared around a bend of the main highway.\r\n\r\n“This certainly looks bad,” murmured Sam Rover, as he leaped to\r\nthe ground, accompanied by Jack. Both ran back to the scene of the\r\naccident, followed slowly and somewhat fearfully by Martha and Ruth.\r\n\r\n“Oh, suppose they are killed or terribly hurt?” murmured the Rover girl\r\nto her chum.\r\n\r\n“If they are hurt we’ll have to do what we can for them,” answered\r\nRuth. “I wonder if there is any first-aid kit in your uncle’s machine?”\r\n\r\nThere had been several loud yells of alarm as the low, yellow car\r\nturned over and over in the bushes beside the highway. Now, however, as\r\nJack Rover and his uncle approached, there was an ominous silence, the\r\nspinning wheels of the machine coming to a sudden stop.\r\n\r\n“There is one man!” cried the youthful major, and pointed into some\r\nbushes where the legs of an individual were floundering around in the\r\nair. A few seconds later the man righted himself and struggled to a\r\nnearby tree, dazed and bewildered.\r\n\r\n“There is another fellow――under the auto!” came from Sam Rover. “Come\r\non! Let us get him out before the machine has a chance to settle down\r\non him.”\r\n\r\nThe military training of uncle and nephew stood them in good stead,\r\nand they knew exactly what to do in this emergency. Close at hand was\r\na rail fence, and while Sam Rover strained with might and main to keep\r\nthe yellow car from turning over on the man in the brushwood, Jack\r\nobtained a fence rail. Rushing up with this, he propped it against the\r\nmachine to hold it in place. Then he and his uncle grabbed the unknown\r\nman, who was almost unconscious, and dragged him to safety.\r\n\r\n“Any more in the auto?” panted Jack, his quick efforts having almost\r\nwinded him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any.” Sam Rover turned to the man who was leaning against\r\nthe tree. “Were there more than two of you?” he questioned.\r\n\r\n“No!” bellowed that individual, glaring at the Rovers. “You’ve got us\r\nin a fine fix, I must say!” he went on sourly.\r\n\r\n“I think you fellows were as much to blame as any one,” answered Sam\r\nRover, curtly. “However, now is no time to quarrel. Your friend seems\r\nto be pretty well used up.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he’s hurt as much as I am,” said the other man, surlily.\r\n“I was pitched out right on my head.” He was now rubbing the back of\r\nhis neck and his left shoulder. “For all I know, something may be\r\nbroken.”\r\n\r\nReasoning that the sour-faced individual would not argue in this\r\nfashion if he were seriously hurt, Sam Rover turned his attention to\r\nthe other man, and Jack did likewise. The young major had noted a tiny\r\nwatercourse close to where the roads intersected, and now he ran to\r\nthis and brought back a capful of water. With this they bathed the\r\nman’s face, so that he soon opened his eyes and sat up.\r\n\r\n“Any bones broken?” asked Jack’s uncle, kindly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.” The man pulled himself together slowly, and then\r\nstarted to rise. “Gee, but my back feels sore! We certainly came a\r\ncropper, didn’t we?” and he grinned sheepishly at the Rovers.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad no one was killed,” said Sam Rover.\r\n\r\n“See here! This is your fault,” howled the other man, coming forward\r\nstiffly. “You had no business to be racin’ on this road.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I was running as fast as you were,” answered Jack’s\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“I bet you wasn’t,” put in the other man, still grinning. He turned\r\nto his companion in misfortune. “I told you, Ferguson, not to hit ’er\r\nup quite so fast. Some time you’ll climb a stone wall and land in the\r\ncemetery.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up, Billings,” growled the man called Ferguson. “I know what\r\nI was doin’. It was this fellow’s fault, and he’s got to pay for the\r\ndamage done.”\r\n\r\n“All right, make him pay,” was the good-natured comment from Billings.\r\nThen suddenly he began to chuckle. “I wonder how much of the stuff we\r\nsmashed, Bill,” he went on.\r\n\r\n“Shut your jaw, you fool!” cried Ferguson. “I say this fellow has got\r\nto pay for the damage done.”\r\n\r\nWhile the men were talking Jack and the two girls had moved closer to\r\nthe upset car to inspect it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, look, Jack!” whispered Ruth, suddenly. “What is that running from\r\nit? Is it the gasoline?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so.” The young major made a closer inspection and began\r\nto sniff the air. “It’s liquor. These fellows are carrying hooch.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, did you ever!” murmured Martha, in horror, for she had never had\r\nany use for liquor in any form.\r\n\r\n“Say, you get away from that car!” burst out Bill Ferguson, in sudden\r\nalarm. “Get away from there, I say!”\r\n\r\n“They are carrying liquor. The car is loaded with it, Uncle Sam!” cried\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and they have both been drinking,” answered his uncle quickly. He\r\nturned to the two men. “If you want to make a police affair of this,\r\nI’m willing,” he continued sternly. “But I’ll tell you right now,\r\nyou’ll make a poor showing in a police court.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, call it off! Call it off, Ferguson!” interposed Billings, as\r\ngood-naturedly as ever. “I ain’t making no kick, and half the cargo\r\nbelongs to me at that. Do you want us to get in bad around here? Call\r\nit off, I tell you!”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t goin’ to have this car busted up for nothin’,” grumbled\r\nFerguson. “However,” he added hastily, “I suppose I’ll have to let it\r\npass. We ain’t got any witnesses against you.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be lucky if you both keep out of jail,” answered Sam Rover,\r\npointedly. “Carrying liquor around like that is prohibited, and you\r\nknow it. I advise you to get out of the business and stay out.” Jack’s\r\nuncle turned to those with him. “Come on, and we’ll see if we can catch\r\nup to your Uncle Tom.”\r\n\r\nAs the Rovers and Ruth left the vicinity of the accident the two men\r\nwatched them narrowly. On the face of Billings there was a look of\r\ndismay, while Ferguson appeared more sour than ever. He glared sharply\r\nat Jack.\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’ll meet again some day, and under different circumstances,”\r\nhe remarked, with a scowl.\r\n\r\n“What awful men!” was Ruth’s comment, as they climbed into the\r\nautomobile once more. “I’d hate to be alone and meet them.”\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose they are, Uncle Sam? A couple of liquor runners?”\r\n\r\n“More than likely, Jack,” answered his uncle. “But one thing is\r\ncertain――this load of liquor will never be delivered,” he added, with a\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why they can’t obey the law and leave liquor alone,”\r\nremarked Martha, as the car was backed to the other road and then sent\r\nforward in the direction Tom Rover had taken.\r\n\r\n“There is too much money in it, that’s why,” answered her uncle. “Some\r\nof these rum-runners――or bootleggers, as they are called――have become\r\nmillionaires at the game. They sell all sorts of the vilest kind of\r\nconcoctions at exorbitant prices.”\r\n\r\nThey ran on for several miles and then reached a point where they found\r\nthe other automobile resting by the roadside.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t know whether you were lost, strayed or stolen,” called out Tom\r\nRover, gayly. “What happened? Did you get a puncture or just stop to\r\npick buttercups?”\r\n\r\n“No. We’ve been dabbling in spirits,” answered his brother, just as\r\ngayly.\r\n\r\n“And we knocked the spirits out in one round,” added Jack.\r\n\r\nThen the story of the accident on the road was narrated, the others\r\nlistening with keen interest.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I wish I’d been there!” declared Andy, wistfully. “I’m never\r\naround when anything like that happens!”\r\n\r\n“Never around!” cried Fred. “If I know anything about it, you’re\r\ngenerally in the thick of it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad neither of the men was seriously hurt, even if they are\r\nbootleggers,” remarked Mary. “And as for their liquor, it served them\r\nright to have it smashed and spilt.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you that one man, the fellow named Bill Ferguson, was\r\ncertainly mad,” said Jack to his cousins. “He looked as if he wanted to\r\nchew us up.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better keep your eyes open in case you meet him again,” remarked\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it isn’t likely that we’ll ever meet again,” replied the young\r\nmajor. But in this he was mistaken. He was to meet Bill Ferguson again\r\nand under the most thrilling of circumstances.\r\n\r\nOnce more the two automobiles proceeded on their way. And while they\r\nare thus rolling along let me take the opportunity to introduce my\r\ncharacters more specifically.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of this series, entitled “The Rover Boys at\r\nSchool,” I introduced three brothers, Dick, Tom and Sam Rover, who\r\nresided at that time with their Uncle Randolph and their Aunt Martha at\r\nValley Brook Farm, a pleasant country place in New York state. From the\r\nfarm the boys had been sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy and, later\r\non, to Brill College. Then they had gone into business in Wall Street,\r\nNew York, under the name of The Rover Company. Each had been married to\r\na boyhood sweetheart, and now the three families resided in adjoining\r\nresidences on Riverside Drive overlooking the beautiful Hudson River,\r\nin New York City.\r\n\r\nNot a long while after his marriage to Dora Stanhope, Dick had been\r\nblessed with a son, John, who was always called Jack, and a daughter,\r\nMartha, who was a year younger than her brother. To Sam Rover and his\r\nwife Grace had come a daughter, Mary, and, about a year later, a son,\r\nwho was named Fred after an old school chum, Fred Garrison. Tom and his\r\nwife, Nellie, were blessed with a healthy pair of boy twins, one called\r\nAndy, after his grandfather, Anderson, and the other Randy, after Uncle\r\nRandolph.\r\n\r\nAs they resided side by side, the younger generation of Rover boys, as\r\nwell as their sisters, were brought up very much as one large family.\r\nAt first the young folks were sent to some private institutions of\r\nlearning in the Metropolis. But presently Andy and Randy, as well as\r\nthe other boys, began to develop such a propensity for fun it was\r\ndecided to send them to some stricter institution of learning.\r\n\r\nAt that time Larry Colby was at the head of a military academy,\r\ncalled Colby Hall. How Jack and Fred and the twins were sent to that\r\ninstitution of learning and what happened to them, has already been\r\nrelated in the volume entitled “The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.”\r\n\r\nAt the school the lads made many friends and also a few enemies. Among\r\ntheir warmest chums were Gif Garrison, the son of their fathers’ old\r\nfriend, Fred Garrison, after whom Fred Rover was named, and Spouter\r\nPowell, the son of the older Rovers’ chum, John Powell, always known as\r\nSongbird because of his propensity for writing what he called poetry.\r\n\r\nA term at Colby Hall had been followed by some winter adventures on\r\n“Snowshoe Island.” Then the boys had returned to school to go into an\r\nencampment “Under Canvas.” Later still the lads had gone on a great\r\n“Hunt,” which had been productive of many adventures. Later still,\r\nafter another term at the military academy, where Jack had gradually\r\nworked his way up from being an under officer to becoming major of\r\nthe school battalion and where Fred had risen until he was now the\r\ncaptain of Company C, the four boys, along with several chums, had gone\r\ninto “The Land of Luck,” otherwise the great oil regions of Texas and\r\nOklahoma.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Spouter announced that his father had purchased a\r\nplace in the far West called “Big Bear Ranch.” The boys were invited to\r\nvisit this place and had a glorious time in the saddle and otherwise.\r\n\r\nColby Hall was located on Clearwater Lake not far from the town of\r\nHaven Point. On the other side of the town was located Clearwater Hall,\r\na school for girls. Among the pupils at this institution were Ruth\r\nStevenson and also May Powell, a cousin of Spouter Powell. Jack and the\r\nother boys speedily became acquainted with these girls, and later on\r\ninduced their parents to allow Martha and Mary to become pupils at the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nGif Garrison had often been a guest of the Rovers. When his father\r\nbecame the owner of a large bungalow at Big Bear Lake, the cadet\r\nreceived permission to use the place for a summer outing. How Gif,\r\nSpouter and the four Rover boys went to this resort, and what stirring\r\nadventures they had there with wild animals and with some students from\r\na rival academy, is told in the volume preceding this, entitled “The\r\nRover Boys at Big Bear Lake.”\r\n\r\n“We certainly had some wonderful happenings at Big Bear Lake,” Fred had\r\nremarked when the boys were returning to Colby Hall after their outing.\r\n“I don’t believe we’ll ever have more strenuous times than those.” But\r\nin this surmise Fred was mistaken, as the pages which follow will prove.\r\n\r\nIt was just growing dark when the two automobiles entered Bridgeville\r\nand pulled up at the leading hotel. Tom Rover had telephoned ahead,\r\nand a substantial supper awaited the crowd, to which, it is needless to\r\nstate, all did full justice. In spite of the narrow escape during the\r\nride, all of the young folks were in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\n“Now tell us what’s the rest of this secret,” demanded Fred. “Where are\r\nwe bound?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell them, girls,” cried Tom Rover. “I’ll tell you what I’ll\r\ndo,” he went on, with that same merry twinkle in his eyes. “I’ll give\r\na five-dollar bill to the boy who first guesses where we are going to\r\nstop to-night. Now, no more questions, only keep your eyes wide open.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so far, for all I know, we may be headed for New York City,” was\r\nFred’s comment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and we may be headed for the north pole,” answered his fun-loving\r\nuncle, gayly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after supper, the automobile trip was resumed. Mile\r\nafter mile was reeled off in the semi-darkness, the powerful lights of\r\nboth machines making the road almost as bright as day. Travel seemed to\r\nbe light on the highway, and they made rapid progress for thirty miles\r\nor more.\r\n\r\n“Hello, here is a brand new concrete road!” exclaimed Fred presently.\r\n“Looks as if it had just been opened.”\r\n\r\n“Opened less than a week ago,” answered his uncle. “Now watch sharp if\r\nyou want to win that prize.”\r\n\r\nOn and on sped the two automobiles. Seven miles more were covered, and\r\nthen they turned sharply to the left and mounted a long hill thickly\r\nwooded on either side. At the top of the hill both automobiles came to\r\na stop.\r\n\r\n“Why, I declare!” stammered Fred. “It’s Dexter’s Corners! There is the\r\nSwift River and there’s the railroad station at Oak Run! Why, we’re\r\ngoing to Valley Brook Farm!”\r\n\r\n“Right-o!” sang out his uncle. And then he tooted the horn three times.\r\nAt the same time the horn from the other automobile sounded out.\r\n\r\n“Hello, they’ve discovered it too!” burst out Mary.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Valley Brook Farm!” shouted Randy.\r\n\r\n“What do you know about this?” came from the other automobile, in\r\nJack’s voice. “Some surprise, eh? We’re going to have our Thanksgiving\r\nturkey on the farm.” And then he added quickly: “Will father and mother\r\nbe there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they’re coming up on the early morning train to-morrow,” answered\r\nhis Uncle Sam.\r\n\r\nIn a minute more they had passed across the river in the direction of\r\nDexter’s Corners. Then they struck the old road leading to the farm\r\nwhere great-uncle Randolph and great-aunt Martha resided, and where\r\nDick, Tom and Sam had spent so much time when their father, Anderson\r\nRover, had been lost in the jungles of Africa.\r\n\r\n“My, but the old place certainly looks good to me!” cried Jack, as they\r\nrolled up, both machines sounding their horns loudly.\r\n\r\nThe old farmhouse was glowing with lights, and now the front door\r\nopened, revealing Anderson Rover and Randolph Rover and his wife\r\nMartha. Then a side door opened likewise, and to the front came rushing\r\nJack Ness, the old hired man, and Aleck Pop, the colored man who had\r\nbeen the Rovers’ servant for so many years.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Valley Brook Farm!” shouted Randy, as he rushed forward to\r\nembrace his Aunt Martha, and the other boys echoed the cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                        A THANKSGIVING REUNION\r\n\r\n\r\n“How good it seems to be at the farm once more,” remarked Fred, after\r\nthe various greetings were over and old Aunt Martha had bustled off to\r\nget a bit of lunch for the travelers before they retired for the night.\r\n\r\n“It’s a beautiful old place,” said Ruth to Jack. “I know I’m going to\r\nhave a splendid time here.”\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad I can’t be with you, Ruth,” returned the young major,\r\nrather wistfully. “But you know the old saying――a fellow can’t be in\r\ntwo places at once.”\r\n\r\n“I only hope that motor-boat trip proves a pleasant one, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think it will be a dandy. Ralph Mason, you know, is a fine\r\nfellow, and he said the motor boat was a peach.”\r\n\r\nAll the young folks were tired out because of the various doings of the\r\nday, and were glad enough to retire as soon as they had partaken of the\r\nrefreshments served. The boys slept soundly, and so did the girls, and\r\nnone of them put in an appearance until it was time for breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Jack!” cried Randy, as he met the hired man on the side porch.\r\n“How are you feeling these days?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty good, everything considered,” answered Jack Ness, with a grin.\r\n“Ain’t quite as young as I used to be when your dad was a boy around\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“He tells me you used to have great times together.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we did――when your dad and your uncles didn’t get to cuttin’ up\r\ntoo high.”\r\n\r\n“So they cut up once in a while, did they?”\r\n\r\n“They sure did!”\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Tom Rover drove over to the railroad station to meet\r\nDick and his wife. Jack and his sister went along, while Mary took Ruth\r\nto show her over the place.\r\n\r\n“Well, Aleck, you’re getting younger every day,” remarked Andy, gayly,\r\nas he met the old colored man bringing in some onions and turnips from\r\nthe barn.\r\n\r\n“Can’t say as I’s much younger, but I ce’tainly doan feel no older,\r\nMassa Andy,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t had the mumps, have you?” went on Andy, somewhat anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Mumps? No, sah, I ain’t had no mumps.”\r\n\r\n“Then maybe it was the measles?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah, Massa Andy, I ain’t had no measles either.”\r\n\r\n“That’s queer. Perhaps it was chilblains, or lumbago, or turtle-foot?”\r\n\r\n“No, I ain’t had no chilblains nor no lumbago. But w’at’s dat\r\nturtle-foot? I ain’t never done hear of him.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of turtle-foot?” demanded the fun-loving Rover boy. “Now\r\nisn’t that strange! I thought you were brought up in a place where\r\neverybody had turtle-foot once in a while. Your nose looks just as\r\nif you’d had it. And just look at your ears! They’re all curled up\r\nlike dead leaves. Don’t feel as if you wanted to see a doctor or an\r\nundertaker, do you, Aleck?”\r\n\r\n“Say, w’at you want to do? Scare dis nigger out of his life?” questioned\r\nAleck, his eyes as big as saucers. “I doan feel nothin’ the matter with\r\nmy ears,” and he felt of both ears carefully. “An’ my nose seems all\r\nright, too,” he went on.\r\n\r\n“All right. I only wanted to know. We can’t afford to have anything\r\nhappen to the best looking colored man on the farm,” returned Andy,\r\nwith great seriousness.\r\n\r\n“Say, you’re only jokin’, Massa Andy. You is jest like your dad before\r\nyou. He was always botherin’ the life out o’ dis coon. But he was a\r\nnice boy――yes, sah, he was. An’ he’s a nice man, too,” added Aleck,\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Aleck. I brought you a sure cure for your ills,” continued\r\nthe fun-loving Rover. “Picked it up at a store in Haven Point a few\r\ndays ago. It will cure you of turtle-foot, rheumatism, misery, or\r\nanything else. Whenever you’re not feeling in the best of condition,\r\njust smell it real hard, and you’ll feel better at once,” and thus\r\ntalking, Andy brought from his pocket a small article wrapped in tissue\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Massa Andy, dat’s right good of you to remember dis ol’\r\nnigger,” answered Aleck, taking the package. “Want me to look at it\r\nright now?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Aleck. And remember, if you don’t feel in the best of\r\nhealth just smell of it good and strong.”\r\n\r\nSetting down his basket of turnips and onions, the colored man unwrapped\r\nthe article somewhat gingerly. To his gaze there was displayed an\r\nimitation rabbit’s foot that looked almost real.\r\n\r\n“A rabbit’s foot! Dat sure am good luck!” he exclaimed, his eyes\r\nglistening. “Ain’t nothin’ better.” He turned the article over in his\r\nhands. “I ain’t feelin’ so very scrumptuous this mornin’, so maybe I’d\r\nbetter take a smell of it,” he ventured.\r\n\r\n“Sure, Aleck. But remember, you have to smell good and powerful.\r\nOtherwise the charm won’t work,” returned Andy.\r\n\r\nAleck looked at the imitation rabbit’s foot again, and then lifted the\r\narticle to his nostrils. He closed his mouth tightly and took a long,\r\ndeep breath through his nose. The next instant the colored man jerked\r\nback his head and his eyes stared as if about to start from his face.\r\nThen his head went back and he gave a resounding sneeze.\r\n\r\nKerchoo! kerchoo! kerchoo! Loud and clear came one sneeze after another\r\nwhile the tears began to run down Aleck’s face.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, it’s taking effect!” shouted Andy, gayly.\r\n\r\n“Dat dere rabbit’s foot am――kerchoo――am full of――kerchoo――pepper!”\r\ngasped Aleck Pop. “You done――kerchoo――played a――kerchoo――trick on de\r\nol’ man!” And then he went off into another spasm of sneezing.\r\n\r\n“That will make you feel like a new man, sure,” put in Randy, who stood\r\nnear by watching proceedings. Andy had told him about the rabbit’s foot\r\nand what fun he hoped to have with the article.\r\n\r\n“It certainly will clear out your head, Aleck,” was Fred’s comment,\r\nwith a grin. “Keep right on sneezing.”\r\n\r\n“Am dat a cure, or am it only ’nother trick?” demanded Aleck, between\r\nmore sneezes.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to take it for what it’s worth, Aleck,” replied Andy, with\r\na chuckle. “If you don’t like it, you know you can always pass it\r\nalong.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps Jack Ness would like to try the cure,” suggested Randy.\r\n\r\n“By golly, dat’s w’at I’ll do! I’ll try it on Ness.” And then Aleck\r\nPop pocketed the imitation rabbit’s foot so well seasoned with cayenne\r\npepper and resumed his errand.\r\n\r\nThe train came in promptly, and it goes without saying that Jack and\r\nMartha were glad to see their father and mother. Dick Rover looked the\r\npicture of health, and his wife Dora was as beautiful as ever.\r\n\r\n“We’re sure going to have some family reunion,” remarked Jack, as\r\nthey rode back to the farm. “Everybody will be on hand to eat the two\r\nturkeys Aunt Martha is having roasted.”\r\n\r\n“And you just ought to see the pumpkin and other pies in the pantry!”\r\ncame from Martha. “I’m sure all the boys will eat themselves sick.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! I don’t see you and Mary holding back on pie, or turkey\r\neither,” returned her brother, quickly.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a grand family reunion. The dining table extended from\r\none end of the dining room through the folding doors of the sitting\r\nroom. At the head of the table sat Grandfather Anderson Rover, with old\r\nUncle Randolph and his wife Martha beside him. Then came the fathers\r\nand mothers of the Rover boys, and the young folks occupied the other\r\nend of the table, with Ruth, the only outside guest, sitting between\r\nMartha and Jack. It was old Uncle Randolph who asked the blessing,\r\nand it can truthfully be said that all were thankful that they were\r\ntogether and in the best of health.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what――a gathering like this is something to be\r\nremembered,” remarked Dick Rover.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, Dick,” came from Dora, his wife. “There is no telling how\r\nlong these gatherings can last. Your father and your Aunt Martha and\r\nUncle Randolph are certainly growing old.”\r\n\r\nIt was a great feast, and all of the young folks ate turkey and\r\ncranberry sauce and mashed potatoes and turnips and boiled onions until\r\nthey had to desist in order to save room for the pies and other dessert\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I feel like a stuffed alderman!” sighed Randy, at last. “I\r\ncouldn’t eat another mouthful if I tried.”\r\n\r\n“Same here,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“If I tried to eat another piece of pie, I’d bust off every button I’ve\r\ngot,” was the way Andy expressed himself.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we take a walk?” suggested Jack. “We need it.”\r\n\r\n“I expect you want to work up an appetite for supper,” said Mary, slyly.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to do something, haven’t we?” her cousin retorted.\r\n\r\nAll of the young folks were glad to get out into the air again, and\r\nthey ended by taking a long walk back of the farm where the Rick Rack\r\nRiver flowed. The lads had gone over this territory a number of times,\r\nand Jack pointed out to Ruth where his father and his uncles had had\r\nnumerous adventures in the past――adventures which have been jotted down\r\nfrom time to time in the earlier volumes of the First Series.\r\n\r\n“I wish you were going along on that motor-boat trip, Ruth,” remarked\r\nJack, when the pair were strolling along a little apart from the others.\r\n\r\n“It would be nice if we were all going,” admitted the girl. “But I\r\nguess the motor boat would be pretty well crowded.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Ralph said she wouldn’t hold any more than the crowd that is to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you expect to be back in time for school?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we’ll be back unless the unexpected happens.”\r\n\r\nAll arrangements had already been made, and bright and early on the\r\nmorning following Thanksgiving the four Rover boys said good-bye to\r\ntheir parents and the others and drove away to the railroad station at\r\nOak Run. Here they took a train for the Junction, and there changed to\r\nan express for Worcester.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if Ralph will be waiting for us at Woods Hole?” remarked\r\nFred, while on the way.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\nThe boys had lunch on the train, and at Worcester changed to another\r\ntrain which connected at Middleboro for Woods Hole. The run was rather\r\na long one, with numerous stops, and as a consequence they did not\r\nreach Woods Hole until well toward evening.\r\n\r\n“I see Ralph!” exclaimed Randy, as they alighted from the train, and\r\nthe next minute the former major of the Colby Hall battalion was\r\nstriding up to the Rovers.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid the train might be late,” remarked Ralph, after shaking\r\nhands all around.\r\n\r\n“How’s the motor boat?” questioned Fred, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Fine and dandy. I’ve had a man go over her carefully, so that she is\r\nin first-class condition.”\r\n\r\n“What about Gif and Spouter?” questioned Jack.\r\n\r\n“They’re coming a little later. Come ahead――I’ve got accommodations for\r\nall hands.”\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour the boys found themselves located at an\r\nold-fashioned but comfortable hotel overlooking the waters of Vineyard\r\nSound. Not far distant was the dock at which the _Fancy_, as the motor\r\nboat was named, was tied up.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys were washing up for supper when Gif and Spouter arrived,\r\nhaving made the trip to Woods Hole in an automobile run by Mr.\r\nGarrison, who, however, had to proceed on his way because of business.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, have the best time possible,” said he, as he bade his son\r\nand the others farewell. “And above all things, don’t get into any\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ll be all right, Dad. Don’t worry,” returned Gif; and a few\r\nminutes later the seven boys were left to themselves.\r\n\r\nAll of the lads were in the best of spirits, and it must be confessed\r\nthat they were far from quiet when discussing their plans for the\r\nouting while in their rooms after supper.\r\n\r\n“We’ll run from here over to Oak Bluffs on Marthas Vineyard,” announced\r\nRalph. “We can stay there a day and run around to Edgartown and stay\r\nthere also, if we desire. Then we’ll run straight over to Nantucket,\r\nwhere there is a splendid harbor. After that we can run over to Chatham\r\nand other places on Cape Cod.”\r\n\r\n“Sounds mighty good,” said Randy.\r\n\r\nThe boys arranged many of the details of the trip and then turned in to\r\ndream of the happy times in store for them. But none of them dreamed of\r\nthe many perils ahead, nor of the thrilling adventures through which\r\nthey were to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                           AT OLD NANTUCKET\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for a life on the ocean wave!” shouted Andy.\r\n\r\n“A home on the rolling deep!” came from Randy.\r\n\r\n“If you fellows don’t all get seasick before you get back,” interposed\r\nGif, closing one eye suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Seasick? Perish the thought!” cried Andy, tragically. “This crowd\r\nnever gets seasick.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say it’s some dandy day for starting a trip,” put in Jack. “It’s\r\nas fine as if we’d had it made to order.”\r\n\r\n“What a beautiful harbor,” was Spouter’s comment. “Isn’t it queer there\r\naren’t more boats around?”\r\n\r\n“You must remember the season is a little late,” answered Ralph.\r\n“During the summer you’ll find boats galore around here.”\r\n\r\n“What about a harbor at Marthas Vineyard?” questioned Fred.\r\n\r\n“Very fine. And another fine one at Nantucket,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe boys had left Woods Hole half an hour before and were now headed\r\nsoutheast for their first stopping-point, which was to be at Oak Bluffs\r\non the island of Marthas Vineyard. The _Fancy_ rode well, riding the\r\nswells of the Sound like a thing of life. The sun shone brightly, there\r\nwas scarcely any wind, and it was indeed a perfect day for the start of\r\nthe boys’ motor-boat cruise.\r\n\r\nThe _Fancy_ was a new purchase by Mr. Mason, and a better equipped\r\nmotor boat could scarcely be imagined. The craft was about thirty-five\r\nfeet in length and just broad enough to be safe and comfortable without\r\nsacrificing too much speed. The cockpit boasted of an engine of the\r\nlatest design capable of a high degree of speed, weather permitting.\r\nThe boat boasted of a fairly good-sized cabin, all of the windows of\r\nwhich could be raised or lowered as desired. The craft was finished\r\nin oak and all of the fittings were of brass, now polished to the\r\nhighest degree. Ralph had always been a neat boy, a stickler for order,\r\nand this had obtained for him the position of major of the school\r\nbattalion, and his neatness and orderliness were now reflected in the\r\nappearance of the craft he commanded.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want me to take the wheel for a while?” questioned Jack, who\r\nhad been itching to run the motor boat.\r\n\r\n“Sure, you can take the wheel,” responded Ralph, readily. “I’ll take a\r\nsquint at the engine. A new engine like that always needs looking over,\r\nyou know, until it works down to a bearing.”\r\n\r\nAs space on the _Fancy_ was somewhat limited, due to the fact that\r\nthe boys had rigged up berths in the cabin in case they wished to\r\nsleep on the craft, they had brought along only such luggage as seemed\r\nabsolutely necessary. Their things were soon stowed away, and then they\r\ngave themselves up to the enjoyment of the occasion.\r\n\r\n“Beats being in school all hollow,” declared Andy, as they sped along\r\non their course, the engine humming merrily.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention school,” returned his twin. “We’ll get enough of that\r\nwhen we get back.”\r\n\r\n“What boat is that?” questioned Spouter, as he pointed to a large craft\r\nnot far distant.\r\n\r\n“That’s one of the lightships around here,” replied Ralph. “There are a\r\nnumber of them strung along between here and Nantucket.”\r\n\r\n“Rather a lonely life, staying on a ship like that,” remarked Spouter.\r\n“I wonder how often they get ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it isn’t as lonely as it might be farther away,” answered Ralph.\r\n“I wish I had thought of it before――I’d have brought them some\r\nnewspapers. Very often those going by throw newspapers aboard a\r\nlightship, for which the light men are very thankful.”\r\n\r\nThey had made out the island of Marthas Vineyard ahead of them, and it\r\nwas not long before they approached one of the headlands known as West\r\nChop.\r\n\r\n“The other headland over to our left is East Chop,” explained Ralph.\r\n“And just beyond that is the town of Oak Bluffs. Between the two Chops\r\nis Vineyard Haven harbor.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any oak bluffs,” commented Spouter, who had a keen eye for\r\nscenery and was watching the shoreline closely.\r\n\r\n“I believe somebody said the oak bluffs were swept into the water long\r\nago by a storm,” answered Ralph. “However, the town of Oak Bluffs is\r\nquite a nice one, and the place has a number of good summer hotels.”\r\n\r\nThe run into Vineyard Haven harbor did not take long, and soon the boys\r\nmade a landing and went ashore. It was now close to noon.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad it’s so late in the season,” remarked Ralph, as they were\r\nriding along in a jitney they hired. “Nearly all of the summer hotels\r\nat Oak Bluffs are closed. But I think we’ll find fair accommodations\r\nsomewhere in the town.”\r\n\r\nThey interviewed the jitney driver, who seemed to be a native of the\r\nisland, and were directed by him to the only large hotel that was open.\r\nThere the lads decided to remain for the night, taking the afternoon\r\noff to explore the place.\r\n\r\n“Certainly a pretty resort,” announced Spouter, after dinner and while\r\nthey were riding around the town.\r\n\r\nThey found a splendid road along the shore leading to Edgartown and\r\nwere told there was another fine highway to the westward which ran\r\nthrough Vineyard Haven to Indian Hill and Gay Head.\r\n\r\n“You certainly ought to visit Gay Head,” said the jitney driver. “It’s\r\nonly about twenty miles from here and a splendid drive, and Gay Head\r\nis well worth looking at. You’ll find some of the old Marthas Vineyard\r\nIndians down there, too, selling trinkets.”\r\n\r\nThe boys talked it over, and decided that they would have the driver\r\ntake them to Gay Head and were soon on the way. After passing through\r\nVineyard Haven they struck out through the country in the direction of\r\nIndian Hill, and then passed on through the woods and beyond numerous\r\nfarms until they came out on a high headland close to which was\r\nlocated a government lighthouse.\r\n\r\nGay Head proved to be a series of headlands consisting for the most\r\npart of clay of various colors. As the setting sun played upon this\r\nkaleidoscope of color, Spouter went into ecstasies.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it magnificent!” he cried. “Just look at the wonderful\r\ncombinations of coloring――red, blue, green, brown, and a hundred and\r\none shades! I never dreamed they had anything like this!”\r\n\r\nNearly all the boys took the path leading down from the top of Gay Head\r\nto the beach far below. But Andy and Randy, more venturesome, decided\r\nto find a way of their own.\r\n\r\n“Be careful, there!” sang out Fred. “That stuff is awfully slippery.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’re all right,” responded Randy. “Don’t you worry.”\r\n\r\nHe and his twin brother were walking along one of the larger of the\r\nheadlands. There was a shelf a few feet below, and both attempted to\r\nscramble to this. But as Fred had said, the vari-colored clay was\r\nexceedingly slippery, and almost before they knew it the twins had gone\r\nflat on their backs. Randy clutched at Andy, and both did their best to\r\nkeep from slipping farther.\r\n\r\n“Dig in! Dig in!” gasped Andy, clutching vainly at the slippery clay\r\nbeneath him.\r\n\r\n“Dig in, yourself,” spluttered his twin.\r\n\r\nHe clutched at a slight projection, but the clay came away in his hand,\r\nand down he rolled over and over with his brother close behind him.\r\nThey reached another ledge of clay, which broke beneath their sudden\r\nweight, and then on and on they went, bringing up at last in a mass of\r\nsoft clay but a few yards from the sand that lined the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n“Well, if that isn’t the dog’s false teeth!” gasped Andy, when he could\r\nspeak. “We came down in a hurry, didn’t we?”\r\n\r\n“And we saved a lot of time, I’ll say,” murmured Randy. Then he held up\r\nhis hands. “Just look at these paws, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the paws,” retorted his brother, and then began to grin.\r\n“Look at your clothing, will you? It’s all the colors of the rainbow.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! Look at yourself. You look as if you’d been sleeping on a\r\npainter’s palette.”\r\n\r\nThe two boys arose and brushed themselves off as well as they were\r\nable. Then they limped down to the water’s edge, where they washed\r\ntheir faces and hands. By this time the others had come down by way of\r\nthe regular trail and joined them.\r\n\r\n“Anybody hurt?” questioned Jack, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing hurt but our feelings,” grumbled Randy.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to have those suits cleaned and pressed, I’m thinking,”\r\nremarked Gif. “If you don’t do it, folks will take you for a couple of\r\ntramps.” And then he had to laugh, and everybody joined in, even the\r\ntwins taking the mishap in good part.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting Gay Head, the lads visited the lighthouse, bought a\r\nfew trinkets from some Indian children who had the things on sale, and\r\nthen returned to Oak Bluffs. Here a tailor was found who promised to\r\nclean and press the damaged suits before morning.\r\n\r\nThe following day found the Rover boys and their chums once more aboard\r\nthe motor boat. The gasoline tank had been filled, and soon they were\r\non their way past Oak Bluffs to the harbor at Edgartown.\r\n\r\n“It would be fine to spend a vacation here in the summer time,”\r\nremarked Jack, as they sped along.\r\n\r\n“Look at that big hotel just facing us,” put in Fred. “I wouldn’t\r\nmind stopping there. A fellow wouldn’t have to go very far to go in\r\nbathing,” he continued, pointing to a long row of bathhouses almost in\r\nfront of the hotel.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you jump in now and have a bath, Fred?” said Andy, grinning.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Andy. I’m afraid the water would be a trifle warm,”\r\nresponded the youngest Rover boy.\r\n\r\nAt Edgartown, much to their surprise, the boys ran into several of\r\ntheir school chums, including Dan Soppinger, Ned Lowe and Will Hendry,\r\nalways called Fatty, because of his unusual stoutness.\r\n\r\n“Well, look who’s here!” cried Dan Soppinger.\r\n\r\n“What brought you?” came from Fatty Hendry. “Did you run over here to\r\ntake us back home?”\r\n\r\n“No. We came over to hear Ned sing and play,” answered Randy, and\r\nthis brought on a general smile, for Ned Lowe was well known for his\r\nmanipulation of a mandolin and his propensity for singing funny songs.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about your running out to Nantucket,” remarked Dan\r\nSoppinger, after he had heard the plans of the others. “They’ve been\r\nhaving a lot of fog around here lately. You don’t want to get lost in a\r\nfog.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Dan, don’t be a wet blanket!” cried Fred. “Who ever heard of fog\r\nin weather like this! Why, it’s just perfect!”\r\n\r\n“At the same time, you can’t tell about the weather around here,”\r\nbroke in Fatty Hendry. “I’ve known it to change completely in a few\r\nhours. You had better be careful, and if you see any signs of bad\r\nweather you had better put into the nearest harbor.”\r\n\r\nAll of the boys remained at Edgartown over night and then the trip on\r\nthe _Fancy_ was continued, the motor boat now heading for the town of\r\nNantucket, located on the island of the same name.\r\n\r\n“Now we’ll be getting out on the Atlantic Ocean,” remarked Randy, as\r\nmile after mile was covered on the course eastward and when they had\r\npassed another lightship.\r\n\r\n“They call this Nantucket Sound,” answered Ralph. “But it’s all so open\r\nthat you can hardly tell where the Sound ends and the ocean begins.”\r\n\r\nAs Ralph was not acquainted with the course, they did not arrive at\r\nNantucket harbor until well toward evening. The day, however, had\r\nproved ideal, and every one enjoyed the trip to the utmost. In the\r\nharbor of the quaint old town, which in years gone by was devoted\r\nalmost exclusively to the whaling industry, they found a great number\r\nof craft of all kinds.\r\n\r\n“There are some storm warnings up,” announced Ralph presently. “But I\r\nmust confess that I don’t see anything of a storm.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\nThey spent the evening in roaming around the quaint old town with\r\nits wide cobblestone main street and its narrow alleyways with their\r\nweather-beaten homes. They even took an automobile ride extending\r\nacross the island to ’Sconset, a small colony located directly facing\r\nthe broad Atlantic.\r\n\r\n“Gosh! here’s where a fellow can stand and look right over to Europe,”\r\nannounced Fred.\r\n\r\n“You can if you have good eyesight,” chuckled Randy.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the storm signals were still displayed, but the Rovers\r\nand their chums could see no evidences of anything unusual brewing.\r\nThere was little or no breeze, and the sun shone brightly.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you fellows want to do?” questioned Ralph, after they\r\nhad breakfasted and were walking toward where the motor boat was tied\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“I’d just as lief go on,” answered Fred.\r\n\r\n“So would I,” put in Gif. “We’ve seen about all there is to see around\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and remember this vacation isn’t going to last forever,” came\r\nfrom Randy. “Before we know it, we’ll have to be back at Colby Hall\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nAll the boys were eager to continue the trip, and after seeing to the\r\nsupply of gasoline and oil they had the hotel keeper pack up a generous\r\nlunch for them and then set off.\r\n\r\n“Hi, you fellows! Better beware!” called out one old man, who looked\r\nas if he might have been a sea captain. “We’re going to have some bad\r\nweather before night.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll watch out,” answered Ralph. “If we see anything that looks\r\nmussy, we’ll head for a harbor in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nBy studying the map, the boys had found that Chatham on Cape Cod lay\r\ndue north of the eastern shore of Nantucket. It was not a great many\r\nmiles to this well known summer resort, and all felt sure that they\r\ncould make it without much trouble.\r\n\r\n“Seems to be hardly any swell on the water,” declared Gif. “I thought\r\nit would be a good deal rougher away out here.”\r\n\r\n“I guess it gets rough enough in bad weather,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\nThe engine of the _Fancy_ was running smoothly, and soon they slipped\r\nout of Nantucket harbor and the island gradually faded from sight.\r\n\r\n“A pippin of a boat, and no mistake,” remarked Spouter. “She rides the\r\nocean like a thing of life. Ralph, it was certainly fine of you to\r\noffer this outing.”\r\n\r\n“Better not say too much until we get back,” answered Ralph. “The best\r\nof motor boats kick up sometimes, you know.”\r\n\r\nRalph had scarcely spoken when the kick-up he had mentioned happened.\r\nThe engine seemed to slow down, the cylinders missed fire one after\r\nanother, and then, of a sudden, the motor stopped.\r\n\r\n“Now what’s the matter?” questioned Randy, in dismay.\r\n\r\n“That’s to be found out,” answered Ralph, and his usually confident\r\nface showed his concern.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I hope we haven’t broken down!” whispered Fred to Randy. “We’re a\r\ngood many miles from shore.”\r\n\r\nEagerly Ralph looked over the engine, and so did Jack and Gif.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s the supply pipe,” announced Ralph presently. “It acts to\r\nme as if it was clogged up.”\r\n\r\n“Dirty gasoline would do that,” answered Jack. “I wouldn’t put it past\r\nsome of these strange fellows to sell you any old thing. They don’t\r\ncare as long as they get your money.”\r\n\r\nHe and Ralph worked over the supply pipe, which was so tightly fastened\r\non that it took their combined strength to loosen it. The gasoline did\r\nnot run, and finally with the aid of a fine wire they managed to bring\r\nout of the pipe a small quantity of waste filled with black dirt.\r\n\r\n“Say, fellows, you want to hurry up with those repairs!” cried Andy,\r\nsuddenly. “Just look at those clouds coming up!”\r\n\r\nAll looked in the direction pointed out, and it must be confessed that\r\nthe hearts of the lads sank when they saw what was overtaking them. The\r\nclouds were obscuring the sun, and, almost before they could realize\r\nit, a heavy bank of fog rolled down, enveloping them completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                            LOST IN THE FOG\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving cleared out the supply pipe as well as they were able, Jack\r\nand Ralph adjusted the same. Then the motor was started and after\r\nconsiderable spluttering the engine seemed to work almost as well as\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut all this had taken time, and now the sun was hidden completely, and\r\nthe fog had settled down upon them like a gigantic blanket, shutting\r\noff the view in all directions.\r\n\r\n“They had it right when they put up those storm signals,” was Fred’s\r\ndubious comment. “Gee! did you ever see fog come in such a hurry?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and just notice how wet and cold it is, too,” added Randy,\r\nshivering. “I’ll bet the thermometer has gone down twenty degrees.”\r\n\r\n“We might as well put on our slickers,” suggested Jack, for they had\r\nprovided themselves with raincoats for the trip.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we’ll have to steer by the compass entirely,” said Ralph.\r\n“Which way shall we head――back to Nantucket or for Chatham?”\r\n\r\n“Which do you think is nearest?” questioned Gif.\r\n\r\n“I think we’re about half way, Gif.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, we might as well go on,” put in Spouter. “We don’t want\r\nto be tied up at Nantucket indefinitely. If we reach Chatham, or some\r\nother point on the Cape, then, if the weather continues to be bad, we\r\ncan always get back by train.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we don’t want to leave Ralph alone with the boat,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that would be all right,” answered the former major of the school\r\nbattalion. “I haven’t got to get back, you know. My time is my own. I\r\ncan stay anywhere until the weather clears up, and then it will be an\r\neasy matter for me to run along the coast to New Bedford, where we keep\r\nthe _Fancy_.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to run slow, Ralph, and toot your horn,” said Randy. “We\r\ndon’t want to smash into anything.”\r\n\r\n“Every one of you had better keep his eyes and ears wide open. We’re\r\nright in the course used by a whole lot of steamers going up and down\r\nthe coast. If one of those big vessels hits us it might cut us in two.”\r\n\r\n“Wow! but you’re a cheerful customer,” murmured Andy. “You’ll have us\r\nat the bottom of the ocean before you know it.”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this raillery, Andy knew as well as the others that\r\nthere was need for caution. Two of the lads stationed themselves in\r\nthe bow of the motor boat, and as they proceeded the horn of which the\r\ncraft boasted was sounded frequently.\r\n\r\nNot daring to take too many chances, the _Fancy_ was run at half speed.\r\nThus they had covered about a mile when they heard a hoarse whistle\r\ncoming from a distance.\r\n\r\n“There is one of the big steamers now!” cried Gif.\r\n\r\n“I hope she isn’t headed our way,” put in Spouter, quickly.\r\n\r\nThe boys continued to toot the horn of the motor boat, and listened\r\nintently to the deep tone coming from the unknown. Slowly but surely\r\nthe warning through the fog kept coming closer and closer.\r\n\r\n“My gracious! she’s coming this way as sure as fate,” burst out Fred.\r\n“Toot that horn for all you’re worth!”\r\n\r\n“Let’s yell,” suggested Randy, and all of the boys yelled with might\r\nand main, making as much noise as they had ever made in their lives.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got an idea!” cried Andy, presently, and dashed into the cabin.\r\nHe reappeared with a tin pan and a big spoon. At once he began to beat\r\non the pan as hard as he could.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of intense anxiety. Although they strained their eyes to\r\nthe utmost, none of the lads could pierce the blanket of fog which hung\r\nthickly on every side. They turned on the searchlight, but even this\r\nrevealed nothing but the murky water just ahead of them.\r\n\r\nAnd in that dense fog the hoarse notes from the steamer were highly\r\ndeceptive. First the boys thought they came from the right, then from\r\nthe left, and then they were certain they were dead ahead. Their nerves\r\nwere tense, and every second seemed like an hour. And slowly but surely\r\nthe warning whistle came closer and closer.\r\n\r\n“Maybe you had better back her, Ralph,” suggested Jack, and at once the\r\nengine was started up again and set in reverse.\r\n\r\n“There she is! On our right!” called out Randy, a moment later.\r\n\r\n“She’s heading this way!” screamed Fred.\r\n\r\n“Back her, Ralph! Back her, or we’ll be cut in two!” bellowed Gif.\r\n\r\nLike a great ghost the bow of the steamer shone forth in the rays of\r\nthe motor-boat searchlight. There was a clanging of bells, and the big\r\nsteamer veered off while the _Fancy_ continued to back. As the stern\r\nof the large vessel swept within twenty feet of the smaller craft,\r\nthe boys caught sight of many passengers and some officers peering\r\nanxiously over the rail at them. Then the big steamer was swallowed\r\nup again in the fog and the motor boat and its occupants were left to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that all of the cadets had been scared, and\r\nwith good reason. Now that the peril was over, each felt a sinking\r\nsensation, and Fred and Spouter were close to fainting. It was several\r\nseconds before any one felt like speaking.\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing you backed, Ralph,” said Gif, soberly. “If you\r\nhadn’t done it we might have been cut in two.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got Jack to thank for that,” answered the young commander of the\r\n_Fancy_. “It certainly was a close shave, wasn’t it?” he added, with a\r\nsigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“Well, we’re not yet out of our troubles,” came from Randy. “Where\r\nthere is one boat like that there’s apt to be more. I think we had\r\nbetter head for the Cape as quickly as we can make it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we can’t afford to run fast,” broke in Fred. “The best thing to\r\ndo is to run as cautiously as possible.”\r\n\r\n“I’d give as much as ten dollars to be on land again,” murmured\r\nSpouter. “We were fools not to heed those storm warnings.”\r\n\r\nSo far there had been no rain. But now a miserable drizzle set in, as\r\ncold as it was dismal. The boys buttoned up their slickers tightly and\r\npulled their caps well down over their faces. But with it all they felt\r\nfar from comfortable and could not keep from shivering.\r\n\r\n“Might as well have a bite to eat,” suggested Andy, after another hour\r\nhad passed and they were still in the midst of the cold drizzle and\r\nfog. “Maybe it will warm us up.”\r\n\r\nThe lunch was passed around, and although some of the boys did not have\r\nmuch of an appetite, the food disappeared quite rapidly. With the lunch\r\nthey had brought along a thermos bottle filled with hot coffee, and\r\nthis beverage was comforting.\r\n\r\nPresently the wind began to blow and the boys had hopes that this would\r\ndispel the fog. But they speedily found out their mistake. Once or\r\ntwice they saw a bit of clearing, but then the wind died down and the\r\nfog seemed to become thicker than ever, the glass of the cabin windows\r\nrunning with water inside and out.\r\n\r\n“A fellow doesn’t realize what sunshine means until it fails him,” was\r\nSpouter’s comment. “Gosh! how good it would seem if the sun came out as\r\nbright as it was yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is one thing to be thankful for,” said Jack, trying to be\r\ncheerful. “So far as I can see, this boat doesn’t leak a drop.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t expect a brand new boat to leak, would you?” asked Gif.\r\n\r\n“Some boats might――if they had been kept dry too long,” put in Fred.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think we need worry about the _Fancy_ leaking,” came from\r\nRalph. “And I don’t think we’ll have any serious trouble with the\r\nengine――although, of course, we may have some if that gasoline is too\r\ndirty. After this I’m going to have every gallon I buy strained before\r\nit is put in.”\r\n\r\nAnother half hour passed, and again they heard the hoarse whistle of a\r\nsteamer, this time from their left.\r\n\r\n“She’s coming up the coast, but she doesn’t seem to be very close,”\r\nsaid Andy. “Gosh! I hope she passes by without scaring the wits out of\r\nus,” he added, with a wry smile.\r\n\r\nAs before, the cadets strained their ears. The sounds kept coming\r\ncloser, but presently they died away in the distance, much to the lads’\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nRalph had stopped the engine, but now it was started once more, and\r\nagain they headed in the direction of Cape Cod, steering, of course,\r\nentirely by the compass.\r\n\r\n“I’m heading a little to the westward,” announced Ralph. “I don’t want\r\nto miss the shore of the Cape and get out into the Atlantic by mistake.”\r\n\r\nLess than twenty minutes later they found themselves in more trouble.\r\nAgain the engine stopped, and once more Ralph and Jack, aided by Gif,\r\nbegan a search for the trouble. They found the supply pipe flowing\r\nfreely, and then examined the carburetor, and finally looked over the\r\nwiring.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s in the battery,” said Jack, at last, and when the\r\nsparking was tested this proved to be a fact.\r\n\r\nThe _Fancy_ was equipped with a full set of tools, but, even so, the\r\nboys made a long job of getting the motor to run. In the meanwhile, the\r\nwind had sprung up again, and they found themselves drifting eastward\r\ninto the broad and rolling Atlantic.\r\n\r\n“Gee, this looks as if we might never get back!” whispered Fred to\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that, Fred, or you’ll have us all scared to death.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be half so bad if we could only see where we are,” put in\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n“It would be a great deal better if the fog would lift,” came from\r\nJack. “Then, if we couldn’t get going, we might hoist some sort of\r\nsignal of distress.”\r\n\r\nThe wind now came in irregular puffs, and, having lost her headway, the\r\n_Fancy_ rolled dreadfully and occasionally shipped considerable water.\r\nSeveral of the boys began to bale the craft while the others continued\r\nto work over the battery.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! She’s going!” announced Jack, at last, and all felt something\r\nof relief when the engine was again running. Then the craft was turned\r\naround and headed once more in the direction of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nWith the wind came a regular downpour of rain, yet even this did not\r\nserve to dispel the fog entirely. Try their best, none of the boys\r\ncould see more than four or five yards in any direction. They continued\r\nto sound their horn and occasionally use the flashlight.\r\n\r\n“We ought to be pretty close to the Cape,” said Jack, as they moved\r\nalong cautiously.\r\n\r\n“That depends,” answered Ralph. “We may have drifted out into the ocean\r\na long distance while we were making repairs.”\r\n\r\n“We are certainly having our share of hard luck,” was Gif’s comment.\r\n“But, never mind, I guess we’ll be out of it in an hour or two.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t get out any too quickly for me,” muttered Spouter, who cared\r\nfor the water less than any of the others.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Fred uttered a cry which was taken up by the twins. All had\r\nseen something ahead on their left.\r\n\r\n“Looked like a small boat to me,” declared the youngest Rover.\r\n\r\n“It was a boat! A motor craft something like this one!” declared Randy.\r\n\r\n“And it was loaded with boxes,” put in his twin.\r\n\r\n“Why in the name of common sense didn’t they toot a horn, or something?”\r\nburst out Ralph. “We might have run right into them!”\r\n\r\n“Did you say she was loaded with boxes?” questioned Jack, of his cousin.\r\n\r\n“She sure was, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Then maybe she didn’t want to be seen,” answered the young major,\r\ngrimly. “Those boxes may have been filled with liquor taken from some\r\nrum ship standing off the coast. I saw in a newspaper only last week\r\nthat the rum ships were standing off the coast all the way from Maine\r\nto Florida. All they have to do is to keep outside of the legal limit.”\r\n\r\nAt the alarm given by Fred, Ralph had stopped the engine again. But now\r\nthe trip was once more resumed.\r\n\r\n“If that was a boat carrying liquor from some rum-runner to the shore,\r\nperhaps the big vessel isn’t far off,” remarked Jack, a few minutes\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left his lips when all on board the motor boat\r\nsaw that something unusual was going on just ahead of them. Before\r\nRalph could slow down, the _Fancy_ plowed her way between several\r\nsmall boats, and then struck a glancing blow on the bow of a large\r\nthree-masted schooner.\r\n\r\n“Hi! what are you doing there?” came in a bellowing tone from out of\r\nthe rain and fog.\r\n\r\n“It’s a government boat!”\r\n\r\n“They’re spying on us!”\r\n\r\n“Jump them, boys! Don’t let ’em get away!”\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the cries uttered by those aboard the strange boats.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Ralph had shut off the engine, but the shock of the\r\ncollision had thrown most of the lads off their feet. Then, before the\r\nlads could recover, the _Fancy_ was boarded by half a dozen burly men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                          ABOARD THE SCHOONER\r\n\r\n\r\n“Where are you from?”\r\n\r\n“Are you government spies?”\r\n\r\n“They look pretty young for spies,” announced one of the men, as he\r\nfaced Jack.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by slamming into our boats in this fashion?” roared\r\none elderly fellow, a man with an ugly scar on his jaw. “Do you want to\r\nsend us all to Davy Jones’ Locker?”\r\n\r\n“Better search ’em, Jim. They may be heeled,” muttered another.\r\n\r\n“Here, what do you fellows want?” demanded Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Do you own this boat?” questioned the man with a scar.\r\n\r\n“It belongs to my father.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you from――Hyannis?” asked another of the fellows, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Up with your hands, all of you!” commanded the first man who had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nAs several of the men were armed, the boys felt that it would be\r\nuseless to resist, so they allowed themselves to be searched. Then\r\none of the men went into the cabin and found a pistol which belonged\r\nto Ralph. Of course, the Rovers and their chums were very angry; but\r\nthey saw that they had an exceedingly rough crowd to deal with――men\r\nwho would go to any length to have their own way――so they felt that it\r\nwould be useless to resist.\r\n\r\n“Carrying any loose change with you, Buddy?” questioned one of the men,\r\nleering into Randy’s face and then glancing down at his watch-chain.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” answered Randy. “If I’ve got any money I’m not\r\ngoing to give it to you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so sure of that, Buddy. What are you fellows doing out here,\r\nanyway?”\r\n\r\n“I think they’re too young to be spies,” said one of the men, who\r\nseemed to be a trifle more respectable than his companions.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you be too sure of that, Ike,” was the reply from the man with\r\nthe scar. “The government is getting all sorts of people to watch us\r\nlately. They’ve even got some women folks on our trail.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if they’re spies, we caught ’em nicely,” came from another of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\n“We are not spies, and we want you to let us alone,” said Jack. “We\r\nwere trying to find our way from Nantucket to Chatham, and we hit you\r\nby mistake. It wouldn’t have happened if you had had a horn blowing. We\r\nsounded our own horn every once in a while.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard no horn,” declared one of the men. “You can’t put up a\r\njob on us! I know your sort! We ought to throw the whole bunch of you\r\noverboard!”\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that all of the men had been drinking and that\r\nseveral of them were in anything but an amiable mood. There were three\r\nsmall boats and each of them was piled high with boxes of liquor of\r\nvarious brands. Evidently the boxes had come from the three-masted\r\nschooner, for the larger vessel rode high and appeared to be empty.\r\n\r\nA war of words followed, lasting ten minutes or more. In vain the Rover\r\nboys and their chums pleaded that their coming upon the rum-runners had\r\nbeen an accident. One or two of the men seemed willing to believe them,\r\nbut the majority of the law-breakers were of the opinion that they were\r\nspies.\r\n\r\n“I’ve spotted a motor boat following us two different nights,” said one\r\nof the men. “I’ll bet a new hat this is the same boat. They thought\r\nthey would spot us with our cargoes and hand us over to the federal\r\nagents.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t true! Not a word of it!” said Ralph.\r\n\r\n“We want you to let us go. Otherwise you’re going to get yourselves\r\ninto a lot of trouble,” put in Gif.\r\n\r\nThese words seemed only to anger the men. They conferred among\r\nthemselves, and then one of them, the fellow with the scar, came to\r\nRalph.\r\n\r\n“You go up on the schooner and talk to Captain Gilsen,” said he. “He’s\r\nthe fellow to settle this.”\r\n\r\n“And the rest of you go up with him,” put in another. “He’ll probably\r\nwant to talk to every one of you before he lets you go.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat against their will, one after another of the boys was hustled\r\nup a rope ladder that hung over the side of the schooner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOYS WERE HUSTLED UP THE SIDE OF THE SCHOONER.]\r\n\r\n“What of the motor boat? Who is going to take care of that?” questioned\r\nJack, as he went up.\r\n\r\n“We’ll look after the motor boat,” answered the scar-faced man.\r\n\r\nOnce on the deck of the schooner, Ralph and the others found themselves\r\nconfronted by a burly, dark-faced fellow with a fierce moustache. This\r\nwas Captain Gilsen.\r\n\r\n“Now, I want the straight of this,” the captain said harshly. “No\r\ncrooked story for me, understand!”\r\n\r\n“We’re telling you the simple truth, Captain,” said Ralph, and then he\r\nand Jack and Gif told their story.\r\n\r\n“Humph! Maybe that’s true and maybe it isn’t,” muttered the captain,\r\ntugging at his moustache. “For all I know, if I let you go, as soon as\r\nyou get ashore you’ll get my friends into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ll get into trouble if you don’t let us go,” answered Jack\r\npointedly. “You have no right to detain us.”\r\n\r\n“And you have no right to come up and bump into my schooner,” growled\r\nthe captain. “For all I know, you’ve done a whole lot of damage.”\r\n\r\n“No damage at all outside of a little paint being scraped off,” put in\r\nGif. “And it was a pure accident. If you had had your horn blowing, it\r\nwouldn’t have happened.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you tell me what I ought to be doing,” stormed Captain Gilsen.\r\n“I was running a ship before you were born. You stay right here until I\r\ntalk it over with the other men.”\r\n\r\nWhile the captain was speaking another man had come on deck, rubbing\r\nhis eyes and stretching himself as if he had been asleep. He looked at\r\nthe boys in surprise, and then, as his gaze fell upon Jack, he uttered\r\nan exclamation.\r\n\r\n“What in thunder are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nJack looked at the fellow sharply and then he was equally surprised.\r\nThe newcomer was Bill Ferguson, one of the two men who had been pitched\r\nout of the overturned automobile.\r\n\r\n“Do you know these fellows?” demanded Captain Gilsen, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I know this fellow,” was the surly answer. “He’s the one I was telling\r\nyou about――the fellow who was riding in the automobile that almost\r\nbumped into Billings and me.”\r\n\r\n“What? The same kid? That certainly is interesting!”\r\n\r\n“How did he come here?”\r\n\r\n“You must have slept mighty hard, Bill, or you wouldn’t ask that\r\nquestion,” came from the captain of the schooner. “The whole bunch\r\nsmashed into us with their motor boat. We don’t know whether they are\r\nspies or what they are.” And then the captain continued: “You watch the\r\nbunch while I talk it over with the other fellows. I want to be sure of\r\nwhat I’m doing before I let them go.”\r\n\r\nThe captain walked to the side of the schooner and then went down\r\nthe rope ladder to one of the small boats. Here he held an earnest\r\nconversation with those who had first seen the boys.\r\n\r\n“Well, I didn’t expect to see you quite so soon,” remarked Bill\r\nFerguson, with a leer at Jack. “I ought to give you a sound lickin’,\r\nthat’s what I ought to do!”\r\n\r\n“That accident was your own fault, and you know it,” answered Jack, not\r\nknowing what else to say. “You have no right to blame me for it.”\r\n\r\n“Were you runnin’ the car?”\r\n\r\n“No. My uncle was doing that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, he’s the one, I suppose, I ought to blame.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! It was your own fault.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! How did you get here?”\r\n\r\nAgain the story was told, Bill Ferguson listening with deep interest.\r\nHe scowled sourly when Jack finished. Then, of a sudden, a crafty look\r\ncame into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Where is the motor boat now――tied fast to the schooner?”\r\n\r\n“Tied fast to one of the other boats,” put in Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Is your motor boat an old one?”\r\n\r\n“No, she’s brand new,” answered the young commander of the _Fancy_.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken when he realized that he had made a mistake. A\r\nnew sea-going motor boat is worth considerable money, and Ralph, as\r\nwell as Jack, felt that Ferguson must realize this.\r\n\r\n“You stay where you are. I’ll see what the men have to say myself,”\r\nsaid Bill Ferguson, presently, and strode to the rail.\r\n\r\nThe boys felt in anything but a comfortable position. They were\r\noutnumbered at least three to one, and all of the rum-runners seemed to\r\nbe armed. More than this, as they were on the high seas, the captain of\r\nthe schooner would be likely to do about as he pleased.\r\n\r\n“Say, Ralph, can’t we jump on the motor boat somehow and get away?”\r\nwhispered Gif.\r\n\r\n“If we don’t get away, I’m thinking these fellows will rob us,” came\r\nfrom Randy, who had not forgotten what one of the rascals had said\r\nabout money.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how we can get to the motor boat,” was Ralph’s reply. “Do\r\nyou think we can make it, Jack?”\r\n\r\nThe young major shook his head. He felt that it would not be safe to\r\nmake the attempt in the fog and with the motor boat bobbing up and down\r\non the swells of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Captain Gilsen and the owners of the small\r\nboats lasted for the best part of a quarter of an hour. Then, when\r\nthe captain came on deck again, he held another conference with Bill\r\nFerguson. Later on the Rover boys learned that Ferguson and Gilsen were\r\nnot only cousins, but also partners in their illegal traffic.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say I can’t let you go just yet,” said Captain Gilsen,\r\nwhen he came back to the lads. “Some of the men are afraid that you are\r\nspies and will get them into trouble. They want a chance to get away\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t any right to detain us,” said Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m taking the right. We’ll tie the motor boat fast to the\r\nschooner, and then you can just sit down and suck your thumbs for an\r\nhour or two.”\r\n\r\n“And you can thank your stars you’re gettin’ off so easy,” put in Bill\r\nFerguson. “I ought to give you a good lickin’, that’s what I ought to\r\ndo,” he went on to Jack.\r\n\r\nThe boys had noted that there were at least six or eight sailors on\r\nboard the _Hildegarde_, as the schooner was named. For all they knew,\r\nthese men might also be armed, so it would be folly for them to show\r\nany resistance. This being so, they remained on the deck of the craft\r\nwhile one after another of the smaller boats took their departure. The\r\n_Fancy_ was attached by a long cable to the _Hildegarde_ and was left\r\nin charge of one of the sailors, who seemed to know how to manage such\r\na craft.\r\n\r\n“Now make yourselves at home on deck, but don’t get into mischief,”\r\nsaid Captain Gilsen to the boys, after the small boats were gone. “I’ve\r\ngot a few things to attend to below deck. I’ll be up after a while and\r\nwe can talk matters over.”\r\n\r\nHe and Ferguson went below and in the cabin held a whispered\r\nconversation lasting quite a while. In the meantime, the boys talked\r\nmatters over, trying to determine what would be best for them to do.\r\n\r\n“We are certainly in a pickle,” was the way Spouter expressed himself.\r\n“Half of the men on this boat look to be regular cutthroats.”\r\n\r\n“They’re a bad bunch, you may be sure of that,” answered Jack. “If they\r\nweren’t, they wouldn’t be in any such business.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we can’t haul the motor boat closer, drop aboard, and get\r\naway,” suggested Andy.\r\n\r\n“We might jump overboard and swim for it,” said his brother, “but it\r\nwould be mighty cold.”\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Gilsen showed himself again his face wore rather a sickly\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I have to tell you this,” he said. “But the fact of the\r\nmatter is, we’re afraid to trust you to go ashore just at present. We\r\nwant to give those other fellows a chance to dispose of their cargo.\r\nIf you went ashore, you might spoil everything. So we’ve concluded to\r\ntake you along with us until the weather clears off. Then we’ll let you\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that we’ve got to go with you?” cried Spouter, in dismay.\r\n\r\n“That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose we don’t want to go with you?” put in Gif.\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Gilsen drew himself up.\r\n\r\n“You have to go,” he replied curtly. “This is my ship, and what I say\r\ngoes!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                          A NIGHT OF ANXIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n“You mean to tell us we’re prisoners?” demanded Jack, his eyes flashing.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly prisoners,” returned Captain Gilsen. “There is no use of\r\ngetting so sour about it. This whole happening is your own fault――not\r\nours. We didn’t invite you to come here and spy on our doings.”\r\n\r\n“How long do you want us to remain?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“That will depend on how you behave. If you take things easy like,\r\nwe’ll let you go just as soon as the weather clears. No use of letting\r\nyou go now; you might bump into some of the rest of our ships,” and\r\nagain the captain of the _Hildegarde_ tugged at his heavy moustache.\r\n\r\n“Well, all I’ve got to say is, this is a mighty high-handed\r\nproceeding,” declared Ralph. “However, you’ve got the best of us, and\r\nI suppose we’ve got to submit. Just the same, I want you to understand\r\nthat we are protesting against this whole proceeding.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t let ’em give you any guff,” put in Bill Ferguson, who had\r\nfollowed Captain Gilsen to the deck. “They know they’re in wrong just\r\nas well as we do.”\r\n\r\n“How long do you expect to remain in this vicinity?” questioned Fred.\r\n\r\n“We’re not going to remain at all, now we’ve discharged our cargo,”\r\nanswered the captain.\r\n\r\n“You mean to say you are going to carry us off?” cried Gif.\r\n\r\n“We won’t carry you very far. We’re headed down the coast, so when we\r\nlet you go you’ll be able to get ashore easy.”\r\n\r\nA bitter war of words followed, all of the boys insisting upon it that\r\nthe captain of the _Hildegarde_ had no right to carry them off in this\r\nfashion. Andy and Randy were strongly in favor of fighting for their\r\nrights; but upon seeing this both the captain and Ferguson showed their\r\npistols.\r\n\r\n“You behave yourselves and act like gentlemen, or else somebody is\r\ngoing to get hurt,” warned the captain. “This is my ship, and I won’t\r\nstand for any nonsense while you’re on board. Now the whole bunch of\r\nyou get forward, and don’t let me hear another word out of you until I\r\nlet you go.”\r\n\r\nThen, as the boys were forced to retreat in the direction of the\r\nforecastle of the schooner, Captain Gilsen called his mate, a fellow\r\nnamed Letts, and told him to take charge of the newcomers.\r\n\r\n“Watch ’em closely,” the captain ordered. “Don’t give ’em a chance to\r\narm themselves or put up any kind of a job on us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. I’ll attend to it,” answered Letts. He was a short, stocky\r\nindividual and anything but prepossessing in appearance. Later, the\r\nboys learned that he had once been a prize-fighter in England.\r\n\r\nA short time later, and while the Rover boys and their chums were\r\nwondering what would happen next, orders were given to hoist the sails\r\nand start up the auxiliary engine, and soon the _Hildegarde_ was moving\r\naway through the fog.\r\n\r\n“Which way are you heading?” questioned Ralph, of the mate.\r\n\r\n“Down the coast,” was the curt reply. “Now don’t ask more questions.\r\nWhen the call comes for mess, you can have your share with the men. If\r\nyou have to stay on board over night, I’ll have them fix you up somehow\r\nin the fo’castle.”\r\n\r\nThe lads found the forecastle of the _Hildegarde_ anything but a clean\r\nand sweet-smelling place, and so, after a brief survey, they were glad\r\nto come out on deck again and seek such shelter as they could find in\r\nthe fresh air. All of the hands on the rum-runner eyed them curiously,\r\nbut said little, having evidently been instructed by Letts not to\r\nbecome communicative.\r\n\r\n“Well, we are certainly in a pickle,” announced Jack, dubiously. “I\r\nmust confess I can’t see any way out, either.”\r\n\r\n“Nor can I,” came from Gif.\r\n\r\n“The worst of it is, there is no telling how long they’ll compel us to\r\nremain on board,” broke in Fred.\r\n\r\n“Gee! I wish we had our school rifles here,” remarked Randy. “I think\r\nwe could soon show this bunch where they get off!”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to put up a fight as well as any of you,” said the young\r\nmajor. “But I’m satisfied we would get the worst of it. You saw how the\r\ncaptain and Ferguson drew their pistols at the first sign of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and those rascals would use the pistols, too!” was Spouter’s\r\ncomment. “Both of those skunks are about as hard-boiled as they make\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the mate and the crew are just as vile,” added Fred.\r\n\r\nNot having access to the compass on the ship, the boys had no means\r\nof knowing how the craft was headed. The fog was as thick as ever,\r\nand now the horn was kept sounding as the auxiliary engine drove the\r\n_Hildegarde_ forward, the sails doing little to aid the progress of the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nPresently four bells struck, and one of the hands, a tall, lanky fellow\r\nwho had been watching the boys furtively, came to them and announced\r\nthat the evening mess was ready.\r\n\r\n“You ain’t goin’ to git nothin’ like you’d git at that Astoria-Vanderbilt\r\nHotel in New York,” he announced, his little eyes twinkling\r\ngood-naturedly. “They don’t serve no table de hotie bill of fare on this\r\nschooner. You’ve got to have a cast-iron stomach to stand what you git.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I care to eat,” announced Ralph. “We had a pretty\r\nsubstantial lunch on the motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“The same here,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, we might as well see what they’ve got,” came from Andy,\r\nwhose curiosity was aroused. In spite of the peril, the fun-loving\r\nRover boy enjoyed the novelty of the situation.\r\n\r\n“I think I could go any kind of a cup of coffee, as long as it was\r\nhot,” said his twin.\r\n\r\nLed by the tall, lanky sailor, whose name they afterward ascertained\r\nwas Ira Small, they sat down at one end of the mess table and were\r\nserved with a stew of unknown ingredients, some rye bread and black\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“This is the snake’s toothbrush, and no mistake!” declared Fred, in\r\ndisgust. “I wouldn’t feed the pigs such stuff as this.”\r\n\r\nThe boys sampled the food, drank a little of the coffee, and then left\r\nthe table, several of the hands sneering at them and looking anything\r\nbut friendly. These hands had bottles of liquor which were passed\r\naround freely. One offered his bottle to Jack, but the young major\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I don’t drink,” he said briefly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t drink, eh?” sniffed the sailor. “Well, you don’t know what you\r\nmiss.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the evening wore away and the _Hildegarde_ kept on her course.\r\nThe fog was now lifting slowly, and with this came an increase in the\r\nwind, so that the craft made much better speed than before.\r\n\r\nJack had noted that the tall sailor named Ira Small did not associate\r\nmuch with the other hands. The fellow was a peculiar sort of individual,\r\ngiven to talking to himself and to rubbing his chin as if trying to\r\nrefresh his memory over something.\r\n\r\n“That fellow is a character,” whispered the young major to Ralph. “He\r\ndoesn’t seem to belong to this bunch at all. I wonder how he got here.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe they shanghaied him, just the way they shanghaied us, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think they’re going to keep us on board long, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I must confess I don’t like the looks of things at all.”\r\n\r\n“Randy has an idea that they’ll rob us of everything we’ve got,” said\r\nSpouter, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, they certainly look like a bunch of thieves, or worse,” returned\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n“I made a mistake by letting that fellow Ferguson know that the _Fancy_\r\nis brand new,” said Ralph. “They’ll have their eyes on her, sure! They\r\nknow she is worth quite a bunch of money.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and those rum-runners from shore could use such a motor boat very\r\nnicely,” remarked Randy.\r\n\r\n“But if they keep the boat, how are we going to get ashore?” questioned\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n“Oh, maybe they’ll put us ashore in a rowboat,” answered Jack. “It\r\nwould be just like them to do it. They may leave us with nothing but\r\nour bare clothing, and they may even take our things and give us some\r\nof their old rags.”\r\n\r\nLooking at it from every point of view, it was a disheartening\r\nsituation. One instant the boys felt like arming themselves as best\r\nthey could and making a break for liberty; but the next, caution\r\nprevailed, and they knew that such a move would bring on a fight that\r\nmight prove fatal to one or more of them.\r\n\r\nWhen it came two bells in the first night watch Letts told the boys\r\nthey could turn in and showed them where they could sleep in some\r\nvacant bunks and on the floor of the forecastle.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you going to let us go ashore?” questioned Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Not to-night. Perhaps we’ll be able to let you go in the morning. You\r\ncouldn’t do anything, anyhow, in this heavy fog.”\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it, and so the boys turned in, although none of\r\nthem undressed. In some bunks not far away several sailors were already\r\nsnoring lustily, so the boys had to keep quiet for fear of raising a\r\nnew row.\r\n\r\nIt was a night long to be remembered. For some time neither Jack nor\r\nany of the others could go to sleep. All were cudgeling their brains to\r\nthink of some way by which they might gain their liberty. But nothing\r\ncame to their minds that sounded feasible. At last, worn out by their\r\nexertions, one after another dropped off to sleep, Fred being the last\r\nto close his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning when Jack got up. The others were still slumbering,\r\nand as there seemed no need to arouse them, he slipped quietly out of\r\nthe forecastle to the deck. It was still raining, but the fog was\r\nclearing away rapidly and a strong wind was blowing from the northeast.\r\nAll of the sails of the _Hildegarde_ were set, and the auxiliary engine\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Rover boy found only three hands on deck, one of whom was at\r\nthe wheel. One of the hands proved to be Ira Small, and the tall, lanky\r\nsailor grinned slightly at him as he came up.\r\n\r\n“Got a little sleep, I hope?” said Small, blinking his eyes and rubbing\r\nhis chin vigorously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I slept fairly well after I once got to sleep,” answered Jack. “I\r\nwas worn out――we had put in such a big day.”\r\n\r\nIra Small looked at him questioningly for several seconds and then\r\nlooked up and down the deck to make sure that they were not being\r\nobserved. Then he leaned forward impressively, his long neck extending\r\nlike that of a duck.\r\n\r\n“They ain’t got no right to keep you on board this ship, lad. It’s a\r\nblamed shame, that’s what it is! I wish I could help you and your crowd\r\nto git away.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for that,” said Jack, his eyes lighting up. “I’m glad to\r\nknow we have one friend on board this vessel.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon I made a big mistake when I shipped with Cap’n Gilsen,” went\r\non the tall sailor, rubbing one ear and then the other vigorously and\r\nthen rubbing his chin. “I knew he was in the rum-runnin’ business, but\r\nI thought I could switch him on to somethin’ worth more money.”\r\n\r\n“Where does this schooner hail from?”\r\n\r\n“From Jamaica, lad. But don’t you let ’em know I told you,” went on Ira\r\nSmall, impressively. “They don’t like me none too well as it is, and\r\nthey’d like me still less if they knowed that I was tryin’ to help you\r\nfellows.”\r\n\r\n“From Jamaica!”\r\n\r\n“That’s it. And the ship’s made two trips since I been on board. I\r\nwanted to desert the first time we come up here with licker, but I\r\ndidn’t git no chance. You see, when I shipped, as I said afore, I\r\nthought I could int’rest Cap’n Gilsen in somethin’ that would be worth\r\nmore to him than this rum-runnin’ business. But he won’t listen to me.\r\nHe thinks I’m crazy.” Ira Small shook his head vigorously and then\r\nrubbed his chin once more. “Well, maybe I am. But just the same, some\r\nday I’m goin’ to find them thirteen rocks.”\r\n\r\n“You’re going to find what?” questioned Jack, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ to find them thirteen rocks somewheres down in the West\r\nIndies. I’ve got photygraphs of ’em, and I know jest what they look\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“Thirteen rocks!” repeated Jack. “What good would it do you to find\r\nthose thirteen rocks?”\r\n\r\n“Ha! That’s jest it!” The sailor closed one eye suggestively, glaring\r\nat the young major with the other. “The thirteen rocks is where the\r\npirates buried their treasure――thousands and thousands of dollars’\r\nworth!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                          PLANNING TO ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIra Small glared at Jack in such an impressive manner that the young\r\nmajor of the Colby Hall battalion was not a little disturbed. He did\r\nnot wonder over the fact that Captain Gilsen had thought the sailor\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\n“It would be very fine to find the pirates’ treasure,” he returned\r\nbriefly. “But just now what I am more interested in is getting away\r\nfrom this schooner.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t blame you, lad! I don’t blame you! It’s a poor place for any\r\none to be. An’ it’s much worse than it is now when the men git to\r\ndrinkin’ and fightin’. I’ve been through it a dozen times, an’ I know!\r\nI was a big fool to ever come on board!”\r\n\r\n“Well, why don’t you leave?”\r\n\r\n“Easier said nor done, lad. The cap’n knows I don’t want to stay with\r\nhim, an’ he an’ the mate watch me like a dog his bone. I’d git away\r\nfast enough if I had the chance.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll talk about this again. Don’t say anything about it now,” warned\r\nJack hastily, as he saw the mate of the _Hildegarde_ approaching,\r\nhaving just come from below to take his trick at the wheel.\r\n\r\n“Where are the other young fellows?” questioned Letts, shortly, as he\r\ngazed suspiciously at Jack and then at the retreating form of Ira Small.\r\n\r\n“They haven’t come on deck yet, so I suppose they’re sleeping,”\r\nanswered Jack. “Are you ready to let us take our boat and go?” he went\r\non.\r\n\r\n“We may let you go as soon as it clears a bit. But about taking your\r\nmotor boat, that’s another story. Bill Ferguson, the captain’s partner,\r\nsays he has a claim on it.”\r\n\r\n“A claim? I don’t see how that can be!”\r\n\r\n“It was you and your uncle who were responsible for smashing up an\r\nautomobile with all the liquor aboard.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, so that’s his scheme!” cried Jack, his eyes flashing. “He expects\r\nus to settle that bill, does he? Well, I’ll tell you right now, he\r\nhas another guess coming to him! He and that fellow with him were\r\nresponsible for that accident, and not I――nor my uncle. Besides that,\r\nthe boat belongs to Mr. Mason. I have no claim on it.”\r\n\r\n“Ferguson says you’re all in together and you’ll have to settle for\r\nthat smash-up before you can have that motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“What does he put his claim at? Not that I’ve any idea of settling it.”\r\n\r\n“He says that it’ll cost at least three hundred dollars to repair the\r\ncar, and he lost over a thousand dollars’ worth of liquor.”\r\n\r\n“He had no right to be transporting the liquor.”\r\n\r\n“Fairy tales, lad! Fairy tales!” answered the mate sarcastically.\r\n“Everybody’s doing it. You’ve got to settle with Ferguson before we let\r\nyou take that boat.” And thus speaking the mate walked away to relieve\r\nthe man at the wheel.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the boys were in anything but a happy frame of\r\nmind when they went to get the scanty and badly-cooked breakfast which\r\nwas offered to them. Jack had told the others what the mate had said,\r\nand all were justly indignant.\r\n\r\n“I believe they’re nothing but a bunch of thieves,” was Fred’s comment.\r\n“This is only an excuse for robbing us of the motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I think!” put in Gif. “Gee, I wish we could arm\r\nourselves in some way and compel these fellows to run the schooner\r\nashore.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I got you into so much trouble, Ralph,” said Jack to his\r\nfriend. “I didn’t know that fellow Ferguson would be on board,” and he\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n“It’s not your fault at all, Jack,” returned Ralph, quickly. “That’s\r\nonly an excuse to keep the motor boat. I believe these fellows haven’t\r\nany conscience and they will take everything we’ve got before they let\r\nus go.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe they won’t let us go even then,” put in Randy. “You know the old\r\nsaying, ‘Dead men tell no tales.’ They may take us to sea and drop us\r\noverboard.”\r\n\r\n“Great Cæsar, Randy! you’re the cat’s slippers for scaring us to\r\ndeath,” burst out his twin.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t think they’ll go as far as that,” came from Spouter. “They\r\nwouldn’t dare. But they may take everything we’ve got of value, and\r\nthen turn us adrift in one of their rowboats.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what shall we do?” questioned Jack. “Shall we try to arm\r\nourselves and fight?”\r\n\r\n“It may come to that later, Jack,” answered Ralph. “But just yet I\r\nwouldn’t advise it.”\r\n\r\n“Neither would I,” said Gif.\r\n\r\n“A fight would only give them an excuse for shooting us down,” remarked\r\nFred.\r\n\r\nSlowly the day passed, and with it went the mist and rain. The wind was\r\nnow blowing freely, and the _Hildegarde_ made good progress on her\r\ncourse. The boys were not given a chance to look at the compass, but,\r\nby the sun, knew they must be heading southward. Not a speck of land\r\nwas anywhere in sight.\r\n\r\n“That shows they didn’t go down the coast as they said they would,”\r\nsaid Jack, about the middle of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Where do you suppose they’re bound for?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they’re going straight back to Jamaica,” suggested Spouter.\r\n\r\n“Or to some other island of the West Indies where they can get another\r\nsupply of liquor,” added Randy.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to the stern and take a look at the motor boat,” said Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Maybe they won’t let you go to the stern,” said Andy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll soon find out.”\r\n\r\n“Ralph certainly has a right to look after his own boat,” put in Gif.\r\n“Gosh! these chaps are carrying things with a high hand,” he added,\r\nwith a serious shake of his head.\r\n\r\n“On the high seas a captain’s word is law,” said Fred. “So this fellow\r\ntakes it for granted he can do as he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“I wish a revenue cutter would show up,” came from Spouter.\r\n\r\n“I guess we all wish that,” answered Jack, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if we could only have the whole crowd placed under arrest!”\r\nmuttered Randy.\r\n\r\nAll of the boys walked toward the stern of the schooner, but speedily\r\nfound themselves confronted by Captain Gilsen and Bill Ferguson. One of\r\nthe sailors was now at the wheel.\r\n\r\n“Where you going?” demanded the commander of the _Hildegarde_, curtly.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to take a look at my motor boat to see if it was all right,”\r\nanswered Ralph.\r\n\r\n“The motor boat is all O. K., and I’m claimin’ it,” came from Bill\r\nFerguson. “I’m goin’ to keep it for the damage done to my auto and the\r\nliquor I was carryin’.”\r\n\r\n“I had nothing to do with that accident, and the motor boat belongs to\r\nmy father,” answered Ralph.\r\n\r\n“See here! You keep a civil tongue in your head, or there’ll be trouble\r\non this schooner,” bellowed Ferguson. “All of you fellows are in this\r\ntogether, and I guess one is about as responsible as another. Better\r\nmake ’em go forward, Cap’n, and behave themselves,” he added to his\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n“I want the motor boat, and I want it right now,” answered Ralph. “The\r\nstorm has cleared away, and we want to go ashore.”\r\n\r\n“You talk like that to me, and the next thing you know you’ll be in the\r\nship’s brig!” roared Captain Gilsen. “We’re on the high seas now, and\r\nI’m in command here. Every one of you get forward, and be quick about\r\nit! I’ll let you know when you can go ashore.”\r\n\r\n“All right, we’ll go forward,” answered Ralph, stiffly. “Just the same,\r\nI want you to understand that you’re laying up a lot of trouble for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nAnother war of words followed, several of the hands, and likewise the\r\nmate, coming to the scene to look on. In the end, there was almost a\r\npitched battle, the captain shaking his fist in the boys’ faces and\r\nthreatening them with all sorts of punishment if they did not behave\r\nthemselves and do exactly as he ordered. Ferguson also took part in the\r\nargument, and even grabbed Jack by the arm.\r\n\r\n“You thought you could get away from me; but you can’t,” he said, with\r\na leer. “You’re goin’ to pay good and plenty for that auto wreck.”\r\n\r\n“Let go of my arm!” returned Jack, and gave the fellow a shove that\r\nsent him backward against the ship’s rail. At this Ferguson became\r\nfurious, and would have drawn a pistol had not the mate of the\r\n_Hildegarde_ interposed.\r\n\r\n“No use of fighting now,” he said. “We’ve got a better way of squaring\r\naccounts,” and he looked suggestively at Ferguson.\r\n\r\n“All right. Just as you say,” was the surly response. “But that young\r\ncub has got to be taught a lesson, and I’m the man to teach it to him.”\r\n\r\nThis quarrel made the position of the boys more uncomfortable than\r\never. They moved forward while several of the sailors jeered at them.\r\nEvidently the whole crowd was against the lads, the single exception\r\nbeing Ira Small. The tall, lanky sailor had some work to do, and this\r\nhe did without taking part in the discussion or what followed.\r\n\r\n“Where do you suppose we are?” asked Fred, after another hour had\r\npassed and the breeze seemed to be stronger than ever.\r\n\r\n“I think we’re somewhere off the Jersey coast,” answered Ralph. “But\r\nhow far east I can’t tell. There isn’t a sign of land anywhere.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the hours dragged by, the boys not knowing what to think of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we can’t get aboard the motor boat to-night,” said Randy.\r\n“Of course, we’d have to be very careful about it. But if she is tied\r\non behind, why couldn’t we slip down on the cable, one after another,\r\nand get aboard?”\r\n\r\n“That might be all right,” said Jack. “But we’d have to take some grub\r\nalong, and we’d have to be sure that we had gasoline.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until evening that Jack had another opportunity to talk to\r\nIra Small.\r\n\r\n“See here, Small,” he said, when they met in the semi-darkness, “if you\r\nwant to leave the _Hildegarde_, why don’t you come aboard the motor\r\nboat with us?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to do it first rate,” answered the sailor, in a whisper. “But\r\nwe’d have to be mighty careful or they’d be sure to spot us.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think we could get hold of any provisions and some water to\r\ndrink?”\r\n\r\n“It might be done, lad. But we’d have to be mighty careful, I’ll tell\r\nyou. If they saw any of us runnin’ away they’d shoot at us as sure as\r\nI’m standin’ here.”\r\n\r\n“What about gasoline? Have they any on board?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they’ve a couple o’ barrels. You see, sometimes those small boats\r\nfrom shore have to hang around a long time to keep out o’ the way of\r\nrevenue cutters. Then they use up their gasoline, and they’re glad\r\n’nough to git a new supply from the schooner.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the gasoline kept?”\r\n\r\n“In the oil room up in the bow.”\r\n\r\n“Locked up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But the lock ain’t o’ much account, and could easy be broke.”\r\n\r\n“What about grub?”\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, I don’t think we could git a-hold of much. But we\r\nmight git some――’nough to last, say, a day or two.”\r\n\r\n“And water?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we could git water easy ’nough.”\r\n\r\n“Could we make it to-night?” asked Jack, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Better not try it to-night, lad. After what happened on deck this\r\nafternoon, you’ll be watched close. Better take it easy and pretend\r\nyou’re waitin’ for what may turn up. It may be they’ll let you go\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they will,” answered Jack. “But if they do, do you want\r\nto go with us?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go if I kin make it,” answered Ira Small. “P’r’aps I kin drop\r\noverboard quiet like and git aboard the motor boat without their seein’\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Is anybody aboard the motor boat now?” questioned Jack, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. She comes along all right alone, so the sailor who was on\r\nboard come back to the ship.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Small, you stick to us, and we’ll stick to you. You help us\r\nescape, and you shall be well rewarded.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want no reward. I want to git square with Cap’n Gilsen an’ his\r\nbunch,” answered Ira Small. “I’d like to git away in the motor boat an’\r\nblow the _Hildegarde_ to kingdom come. That bunch of critters on board\r\nthis ship ain’t fit to live.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll see you again about this,” said Jack, as he noted the\r\napproach of Letts.\r\n\r\n“All right, lad. I’ll be ready at the first chance. I want to git away\r\njust as quick as you do. I want to git back to the West Indies an’\r\nspot the thirteen rocks. I’m after pirates’ gold!” concluded the lanky\r\nsailor, as he stalked away hastily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                             ANOTHER PLOT\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore they retired for the night, the boys talked the situation over\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why we can’t make a break for it,” grumbled Randy. “We can\r\nwait until about two or three o’clock in the morning. Nearly everybody\r\nwill be sound asleep by that time, and we could steal to the stern and\r\nget to the motor boat by the cable without half trying.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! But how about grub?” questioned Fred.\r\n\r\n“And how about gasoline?” put in Ralph. “We couldn’t run very long on\r\nthe supply that was left when we were captured. We were running mighty\r\nlow, and I was afraid we would go short before we got out of the fog.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to remember one thing,” observed Spouter. “If they found\r\nus trying to steal away in the darkness, they’d have no mercy on us.\r\nThey’d probably handcuff us and throw us in the ship’s brig and feed us\r\nthe poorest food they have on board.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they’d probably steal everything we’ve got in the bargain,”\r\ncame from Gif.\r\n\r\nIn the end they resolved to take Ira Small’s advice and wait at least\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nAll of the other lads had listened with interest to what Jack had told\r\nthem about the lanky sailor’s yarn of thirteen rocks and the pirates’\r\nhidden gold.\r\n\r\n“It might not be such a fairy tale as you think,” said Fred. “If you’ll\r\nremember, the pirates of years gone by hid lots of gold and other\r\ntreasure on out-of-the-way islands of the West Indies.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but that was a good many years ago,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. I was reading in a newspaper only a short while ago\r\nabout a hunt being made along the South American coast for a treasure\r\nsaid to have been secreted there by one of the notorious buccaneers.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ve all read such yarns,” put in Gif. “There may be some\r\npirates’ gold somewhere. But I’ll wager it’s so well hidden it will\r\nnever be brought to light. Why, folks have been digging for Captain\r\nKidd’s gold ever since I can remember.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what he means by thirteen rocks?” mused Andy.\r\n\r\n“There must be thirteen rocks around the place――maybe pointed ones,”\r\nsaid Jack.\r\n\r\n“In that case, if I ever get down to the West Indies I’m going to keep\r\nmy eyes open for the lucky thirteen,” grinned Randy.\r\n\r\nThe sea air made the boys drowsy, and although several of them thought\r\nto keep awake, almost before they knew it each of them was sound\r\nasleep. Nor did any of them rouse up until the golden sun was peeping\r\nup over the eastern rim of the ocean.\r\n\r\n“Gosh, what a disagreeable smell around here!” muttered Gif, as he\r\narose and stretched himself. “It makes my head ache.”\r\n\r\n“That’s funny. I’ve got a headache myself,” replied Jack, who sat on\r\nthe edge of one of the rough bunks, rubbing his eyes. “I feel just as\r\nif I’d been in a swing, or something like that.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’re getting seasick,” came dismally from Fred. He, too, had\r\njust arisen, and his face was unusually pale while he seemed to breathe\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Say, Fred, you certainly look odd!” cried Jack. “Do you really think\r\nyou’re getting seasick?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” was the slow response from the youngest Rover. “I never\r\nfelt so queer in my life,” he went on, as he took a few staggering\r\nsteps around the forecastle. “Guess I need a little fresh air. It’s\r\ndreadfully close in here.”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be so very late,” said Ralph. He felt for his watch, and then\r\nuttered an exclamation. “My watch is gone!” He thrust his hands into\r\nhis pockets. “My money is gone, too, and so are my keys! Everything is\r\ngone!”\r\n\r\nJack and the others gazed at Ralph in astonishment. Then simultaneously\r\nthey felt in their own pockets.\r\n\r\n“My watch is gone too!”\r\n\r\n“So is mine!”\r\n\r\n“My diamond scarf pin is gone!”\r\n\r\n“So is my ruby ring!”\r\n\r\n“I’m cleaned out of everything!”\r\n\r\n“Gee, fellows! they’ve robbed us!” groaned Randy. “They took everything\r\nwe carried while we were asleep.”\r\n\r\n“How could they do that without some of us waking up?” questioned\r\nSpouter. “We don’t all sleep like logs at once, do we?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it!” exclaimed Jack. “Don’t you remember that funny smell\r\nwe noticed when we first awoke? I’ll bet five dollars to a cent they\r\ndrugged us!”\r\n\r\n“That’s it!” broke in Ralph, eagerly. “Sure they did! That’s the smell\r\nof chloroform. I know, for we used it once when dad chloroformed our\r\nold sick cat.”\r\n\r\nThe others felt that their chum was right, and everybody boiled with\r\nindignation over this new indignity that had been heaped upon them.\r\n\r\n“I wish I had a shotgun――I’d show them a thing or two!” cried Jack, his\r\neyes blazing wrathfully. “Captain Gilsen and his gang are nothing but a\r\nbunch of pirates!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe the captain didn’t do it. This may be the work of Ferguson or\r\nLetts, or some of the others,” remarked Spouter.\r\n\r\nBut the others could not agree with this. They were of the opinion that\r\nthe theft had been committed by those in authority on board the craft.\r\nNevertheless, they took it upon themselves to question several of the\r\nsailors who were just arising.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got any of your stuff, Buddy,” growled one of the men. “And\r\ndon’t you say I have, either, or I’ll knock your block off,” and he\r\nglared wickedly at the boys.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve been robbed, go to the cap’n with your yarn,” said another.\r\n\r\n“I will go to the captain!” returned Jack. “I’m not going to stand for\r\nany such treatment any longer!”\r\n\r\n“And I’m with you!” broke in Randy. “Come on, let’s arm ourselves!”\r\n\r\nThe boys were thoroughly aroused, and each looked around the forecastle\r\nfor something which might be used as a weapon.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice and go slow, you kids,” growled one of the sailors.\r\n“The cap’n and Ferguson and Letts go well heeled, and they’d jest as\r\nlief fill you full of holes as not. You’ve seen a little roughness so\r\nfar, but you haven’t seen nothin’ of what might happen if you got those\r\nmen worked up. The cap’n won’t stop at nothin’ when he’s roused up.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the boys left the forecastle, each armed with a stick or\r\na spike, or whatever came to hand.\r\n\r\nJust as they came on deck they ran into Ira Small. The lanky sailor\r\nlooked at the weapons they carried, and then shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you do it. Throw them clubs away,” he whispered hoarsely. “If\r\nyou start a fight you’ll git the worst of it and spile everything. Take\r\na meek-like way. Pretend you ain’t got no backbone――that you’re scared\r\nstiff――and then maybe we’ll git a chance to outwit ’em. I know how I\r\ncan git some grub and the gasoline you want,” he went on impressively.\r\nThen, as he saw the mate approaching, he hurried back to where he had\r\nbeen busy coiling up some ropes.\r\n\r\n“What’s the meaning of this?” demanded the mate, coming to a halt and\r\neyeing the clubs and other things the boys carried.\r\n\r\n“We were robbed last night, and we want to know who did it,” answered\r\nJack, coldly.\r\n\r\n“Robbed! What do you mean?” and the mate tried to put on an air of\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\n“While we were asleep our watches, money and everything else was taken\r\naway from us,” said Randy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about that,” replied the mate. “But you listen\r\nto me,” he went on sternly. “Drop those things, or it’ll be the worse\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n“I want to talk to Captain Gilsen and to that fellow Ferguson,” said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n“They’re both asleep. You can’t see ’em.”\r\n\r\nSome bitter words followed, and it was all the boys could do to keep\r\nthemselves from pouncing upon the mate and giving him the thrashing\r\nthey felt he deserved. In the midst of the talking, Captain Gilsen and\r\nFerguson appeared, each carrying a pistol.\r\n\r\n“You boys get forward and stay there, and no more nonsense!” roared the\r\ncaptain, when they had again mentioned the robbery. “If I hear another\r\nword out of you, I’ll put you in the brig.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, this is dreadful!” exclaimed Andy, and suddenly burst out\r\ncrying, much to the amazement of the others. But when he had his back\r\nturned on the captain and the other enemies, he winked at his twin and\r\nat Fred.\r\n\r\n“Cry!” he whispered. “Cry for all you’re worth! Make ’em think we’re\r\nlicked bad. Then they won’t watch us.”\r\n\r\nCatching the cue, Fred began to blubber, and Randy followed suit. At\r\nfirst the others were amazed, but then they saw through the trick, and\r\nall suddenly looked glum.\r\n\r\n“It ain’t fair,” whined Jack, in tearful tones. “It ain’t fair at all,\r\nCaptain Gilsen. I think you ought to let us go.”\r\n\r\n“I want to go home!” groaned Gif. “I want to go home!”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t do anything to you,” said Spouter, mournfully.\r\n\r\n“Some day you’ll catch it! You see if you don’t!” bewailed Ralph,\r\nand the seven boys retreated slowly to the forward deck of the\r\n_Hildegarde_, acting as if thoroughly cowed.\r\n\r\n“I reckon they’ve learned their little lesson,” was Captain Gilsen’s\r\ncomment. “I thought I could break ’em sooner or later. I’ll bet in\r\nanother day they’ll be willing to eat out of my hand.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got another scheme,” said Ferguson, a few minutes later, when the\r\nboys were out of hearing. “Perhaps we can make a barrel of money out of\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“It looks to me as if those boys came from pretty wealthy families.\r\nThey wear good clothes and they all had fine jewelry and plenty of\r\nspendin’ money. Don’t you think their folks would pay a good price to\r\nhave the boys back home safe and sound?”\r\n\r\n“You mean hold them for a ransom, Bill?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? That has been done before, and folks have paid handsome, too.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! I hadn’t thought of that, but it might be worth considering,”\r\nanswered the captain of the _Hildegarde_, pulling meditatively at his\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\n“It would be a dead easy thing to do,” continued Ferguson. “We could\r\nsail the schooner over to one o’ those little islands where nobody\r\nlives and git ’em to sign letters askin’ their folks to pay up to have\r\n’em released. Why, say, Cap’n, we might make thousands of dollars out\r\nof it――a good deal more’n we ever made out o’ the liquor business.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but think of the risk we’d be running. It’s a big crime to kidnap\r\npeople like that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, look at the risk we run gettin’ liquor into the States. Some day\r\nthose revenue cutters will open fire on us and maybe blow us to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s find out a little more about the boys,” said Captain Gilsen,\r\nafter a moment’s thought. “If their folks are real well off, it might\r\npay to do as you say. I think the crew will stand for it all right\r\nenough, and I know Letts would be all right――he’s been mixed up in\r\nhalf-a-dozen shady transactions.”\r\n\r\n“Why, say! just look at what we might make out of it,” cried Ferguson,\r\nhis eyes glistening greedily. “If we got only ten thousand dollars for\r\nthe safe delivery of each boy, that would amount to seventy thousand\r\ndollars!”\r\n\r\n“Humph! If their folks are really wealthy, perhaps we can get two\r\nor three times that amount out of ’em, Bill,” returned the captain,\r\ntugging on his moustache more fiercely than ever. “If we go into this\r\nat all, we might as well do it right. Of course, we’d run a big risk,\r\nbut a hundred thousand dollars――or maybe two hundred thousand――isn’t to\r\nbe sneezed at.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        IRA SMALL’S REVELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Andy, I never knew you could cry so cheerfully,” remarked Jack, when\r\nthe boys were once more by themselves and were sure that no outsiders\r\nwere observing them.\r\n\r\n“He’d make a hit on the vaudeville stage,” came from Spouter. “Gosh!\r\nwhen he first started I thought he was really crying.”\r\n\r\n“So did I,” added Gif. “And I didn’t know what to make of it, for Andy\r\nisn’t built that way.”\r\n\r\n“Now we’ve started to appear as if we are half scared to death, I\r\nsuppose we’ve got to keep it up,” remarked Randy.\r\n\r\n“Sure we’ve got to keep it up,” answered Jack, promptly. “It’s a good\r\nstunt. We have to hand it to that sailor, Small. He certainly had the\r\nright idea.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe he isn’t as crazy as some people think,” said Fred. “Lots of\r\npeople are peculiar, but that doesn’t make them insane.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we didn’t find out anything about the things that were stolen,”\r\nremarked Ralph.\r\n\r\n“If we leave the schooner, we’ll probably have to leave those things\r\nbehind,” said Fred. “It’s a shame! I’d like to sneak into the cabin\r\nsome time and take a look around.”\r\n\r\n“So would I!” came simultaneously from the twins.\r\n\r\n“I don’t blame you,” answered Jack. “Just the same, please remember\r\nthat if we want to get away from this schooner soon, we’ve got to be\r\nmighty careful about what we do. If they discover us in any underhand\r\nwork, they’ll come down on us like a thousand of brick.”\r\n\r\nWhile the boys talked the matter over near the bow of the schooner,\r\nCaptain Gilsen, Ferguson and Letts held a conference in the cabin of\r\nthe _Hildegarde_.\r\n\r\n“That sounds pretty good to me,” said the mate, after Ferguson had\r\nunfolded the plan already broached to the captain. “Of course, we might\r\nhave a lot of trouble communicating with those boys’ folks, and more\r\ntrouble getting them to pay up, but I think it could be done.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it could be done!” replied Captain Gilsen, tugging on his\r\nmoustache as usual. “I’ve been thinking it over hard, and I’m sure I\r\nknow just where we can take ’em; a small island off the coast of Porto\r\nRico. From there we can easily get into communication with the mainland\r\nand send out telegrams to their folks.”\r\n\r\n“Those boys may cut up pretty wild when they understand what is going\r\non,” remarked the mate.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they will,” answered Ferguson. “We’ve got ’em pretty\r\nwell cowed.”\r\n\r\n“How you going to keep them from pestering us about going ashore with\r\nthe motor boat?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll concoct a story that the revenue cutters are after us, and that\r\nwe’ve got to keep pretty well out to sea,” was the reply. “We can tell\r\n’em that it’s too rough ’way out there for the motor boat and that\r\nthey’ll be safer aboard the schooner.”\r\n\r\nThereafter the three men went into an earnest discussion of the subject\r\nand finally decided that they would go into the scheme on equal shares\r\nand that each would assume an equal risk.\r\n\r\n“We can easily buy up the whole crew,” said Letts. “I think a hundred\r\ndollars to each man will fix it up.”\r\n\r\n“There’s only one fellow I don’t trust, and that’s Small,” said Captain\r\nGilsen. “He’s a first-class hand, but there’s something about him I\r\ndon’t like.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t worry about Small. We can easily manage him,” sneered the\r\nmate. “Why, that fellow is half crazy. He’s talking about pirates’ gold\r\nand that sort of rot all the time. Just promise him that you’ll go\r\nafter that treasure after this affair is taken care of, and he’ll be\r\nall right.”\r\n\r\nThen the three men discussed the subject of whether or not it would be\r\nadvisable to treat the boys better than had been done.\r\n\r\n“They’re not common sailors, or anything like that,” remarked Letts.\r\n“I suppose it galls ’em to be herded in the fo’castle. Maybe they’d\r\ntake it better if we gave ’em accommodations in the cabin, although how\r\nwe’re going to crowd ’em in, I don’t see.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it!” howled Ferguson. “I don’t believe in bein’ nice to\r\n’em! Treat ’em rough――that’s my way! Treat ’em rough!”\r\n\r\n“I think Bill is right,” said the captain. “If we continue to treat ’em\r\nrough, they’ll be easier to handle when it comes to writing letters\r\nhome in order to obtain their release. We’ll scare them out of their\r\nwits.”\r\n\r\n“And on the other hand, if they agree to do everything we tell ’em, we\r\ncan promise that they’ll get back everything we took away from ’em,”\r\nadded Ferguson. “Of course, we don’t have to give the things back, but\r\nwe can promise it,” and he leered wickedly at his companions.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing the plotters did do, somewhat to the boys’\r\nsurprise. When the call came to dinner they found that Captain Gilsen\r\nhad given orders that they have one of the tables in the forecastle to\r\nthemselves. And on this the meal served was a decided improvement over\r\nthose previously supplied.\r\n\r\n“This is something like,” said Randy, as he tasted the stew and then\r\nsipped some of the coffee. “It shows the cook knows his business when\r\nhe wants to.”\r\n\r\n“Those men have got something up their sleeve or they wouldn’t be\r\ngiving us this food,” returned Jack, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they’re getting a little bit scared over what may be coming to\r\nthem,” said Gif.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t believe it’s that, Gif,” returned the young major.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late in the afternoon that Letts came up to where Jack\r\nand Ralph were standing and smiled rather dubiously at them.\r\n\r\n“We’re in a hole, and you fellows have got to stand for it,” said the\r\nmate. “We thought we could run closer to land and let you take your\r\nmotor boat and go ashore. But we saw some signals a while back, and\r\nwe’ve got to change our plan entirely.”\r\n\r\n“Signals?” queried Ralph. “What sort of signals? I didn’t see anything.”\r\n\r\n“No; because you weren’t looking in the right direction and because you\r\ndidn’t have a spy-glass,” returned Letts. “The captain got signals that\r\ntwo revenue cutters are searching for us. So instead of going inshore\r\nwe’re going out.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean――out on the ocean?” demanded Jack, quickly.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, lad. And we intend to keep out until we’re sure the coast\r\nis clear. Besides that, we’ll be better off outside, I think, because\r\nanother storm is coming.”\r\n\r\nThe boys did not know whether to believe the mate of the _Hildegarde_\r\nor not. However, there was nothing they could do to improve matters, so\r\nthey did not argue with him. They had already noted that the sun was\r\ngoing under some heavy clouds and that the breeze was freshening.\r\n\r\n“They’ve certainly got something up their sleeve regarding us,” said\r\nJack, when he and Ralph were telling the others what the mate had said.\r\n\r\n“Well, it doesn’t look as if we can do anything about getting away\r\nto-night,” said Fred. “I just had a chance to talk to Ira Small, and he\r\nsaid it wouldn’t be any use――that we’re too far out on the Atlantic\r\nand that the storm is coming up fast.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what they’ll do with the motor boat if the storm gets very\r\nheavy!” cried Ralph. “Maybe they’ll cut it adrift!”\r\n\r\n“They won’t want to throw away such a valuable craft unless it becomes\r\nabsolutely necessary,” returned Jack. “I think those fellows are out\r\nfor every dollar they can get――their robbing us proves it!”\r\n\r\nBy the time the boys went to supper the wind was blowing strongly and\r\nthe _Hildegarde_ was pitching and tossing on the broad bosom of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\n“It’s goin’ to be a real storm, to my way o’ thinkin’,” said Ira Small,\r\nwhen he had a chance to speak to the lads. “You kin be thankful you’re\r\nnot out in it in your motor boat. That craft couldn’t make much headway\r\nin sech a sea as the wind is kickin’ up.”\r\n\r\n“Have they done anything about the motor boat?” questioned Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they’ve covered her with a tarpaulin and hitched her on with a\r\ncable that’s twice as long and three times as strong as the first one\r\nwas. I reckon they’re goin’ to save her if they possibly kin, no matter\r\nhow hard it blows.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you think we are, Small?”\r\n\r\n“We’re jest about east o’ Cape Hatteras. An’ lemme tell you, that’s\r\nsome place to be in when a storm comes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we’ve heard all about Cape Hatteras and the awful storms they\r\nhave in that vicinity,” said Fred. “Gee, maybe this old tub will go to\r\nthe bottom!”\r\n\r\nThat night on the _Hildegarde_ proved to be one the boys never forgot.\r\nThe wind seemed to blow stronger and stronger until the vessel was\r\nrolling and pitching in a manner that made it dangerous to cross the\r\ndeck. Nearly every stitch of canvas had been taken in, only enough\r\nbeing left set to give the schooner steerage way. There were several\r\nshowers, but nothing in the way of a heavy downpour, and what little\r\nthere was of thunder and lightning kept in the distance.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m mighty thankful we’re not out in the motor boat,” remarked\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\n“So am I,” answered Fred. “I don’t believe we could do a thing in such\r\na wind as this.”\r\n\r\n“Do you notice that it is not as cold as it was?” remarked Jack. “This\r\nbreeze is quite warm.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because it is coming from the south,” answered Spouter. “You\r\nmust remember that the farther south we go, the warmer it’s going to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“If we’re off Cape Hatteras we’re a good way from home,” put in Ralph.\r\n“Hang the luck, anyhow! Why did we have to run into these miserable\r\nbootleggers?”\r\n\r\nBy midnight the storm was at its height. Sleep for the boys was out\r\nof the question, and they huddled together near the door of the\r\nforecastle, talking in low tones and wishing for daylight to come.\r\n\r\n“It sure is a humdinger of a night!” exclaimed Ira Small, when he came\r\nin from his watch on deck. “The sea is gettin’ worse an’ worse ev’ry\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\n“How long do you think this storm will last, Small?” questioned Jack.\r\n\r\n“Can’t say, lad. It may blow itself out by mornin’, and it may last\r\ntwo or three days. We ain’t in the worst of it――the worst seems to be\r\nfarther down the coast.”\r\n\r\nTo the dismay of the boys, the storm at daybreak was as bad as ever.\r\nThe sea was now running strong and the _Hildegarde_ could hardly keep\r\non her course despite the fact that some sail was set and the auxiliary\r\nengine was being used.\r\n\r\nThe storm seemed to have a bad effect on the sailors. As much as\r\npossible they remained in the forecastle, and three or four of them\r\ninsisted upon drinking heavily. Soon there was a violent quarrel, and\r\none man was hit on the head with a bottle and knocked unconscious. Then\r\nthe captain and the mate were called in, and two of the sailors were\r\nplaced in irons until they could sober up.\r\n\r\n“I must say I’m disgusted with the bunch sailing with me,” said Captain\r\nGilsen to Ferguson, after the quarrel had quieted down. “If we can make\r\nthat bunch of money we spoke about out of those kids, I’ll be willing\r\nto discharge every one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’d better hold ’em together the best we can until we’ve put\r\nour plan through,” answered Ferguson.\r\n\r\nAll day long and the following night the wind kept up, and the\r\n_Hildegarde_ had all it could do to keep on its course. But to the\r\ndelight of the boys, they learned that the motor boat was still in tow\r\nand right side up.\r\n\r\n“The tarpaulin kep’ most o’ the water out,” explained Ira Small. “I\r\nthink she’ll be as good as ever when the storm clears away.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s get what sleep we can,” said Jack, to his chums. “All of the\r\nothers on board the schooner will be worn out because of the storm.\r\nThen, when it calms down, they’ll want to sleep, and that maybe will\r\ngive us a chance to see what we can do.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following afternoon, when the storm had subsided\r\nand matters were running fairly smooth, that Ira Small sidled up to\r\nJack, Ralph and Gif, who chanced to be standing near the forward rail.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got hold o’ that gasoline, and I know how I kin git some grub and\r\nwater,” whispered the lanky sailor hoarsely. “How about it? Do you want\r\nto make a try for it to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it would be safe, Small?” questioned Ralph.\r\n\r\n“You know more about that there motor boat nor I do, but if I was you\r\nboys, I’d not stay on this here schooner a minute longer’n I had to. I\r\njest heard somethin’ that you young fellows might like to hear.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, Small?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“If I tell you, will you promise not to give me away? If they found out\r\nI told you, they might kill me.”\r\n\r\n“We won’t say a word,” said Gif, quickly. “What have you learned?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve learned that they ain’t goin’ to let you go nohow,” answered the\r\nlanky sailor. “They’re goin’ to take you to some island where they’ll\r\nhold you prisoners till your folks pay a whole barrel o’ money to\r\nransom you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                              THE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hold us prisoners?” burst out several of the boys in chorus.\r\n\r\n“That’s what, lads. I had a little work to do at the stern, and I\r\noverheard a talk between Ferguson and the mate. They got it all fixed\r\nwith the cap’n to hold you till your folks pay a whole lot of money to\r\nhave you set free.”\r\n\r\n“The rascals!” cried Jack, indignantly. “I knew they had something up\r\ntheir sleeve! I said so several times!”\r\n\r\n“I guess the quicker we make a break for liberty the better,” put in\r\nGif.\r\n\r\n“I’ll not stay on this schooner another night if I can possibly help\r\nit!” was the way Ralph expressed himself.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you can get the gasoline and the grub and water?”\r\nquestioned Fred, hopefully.\r\n\r\n“Yes, lad. But, of course, some o’ you have got to help me.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll all help!” came eagerly from Randy. “Just tell us how we can\r\nwork it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve found out where they keep the key to the oil room, and I’ve found\r\ntwo empty ten-gallon cans which can be filled with gasoline. There is\r\nplenty of water, and we can put it into anything that comes handy.”\r\n\r\n“What about grub?” questioned Ralph.\r\n\r\n“That’s goin’ to be the hardest part of it; but there is a good store\r\nof everything in the cook’s galley, and I think we kin git in there and\r\nhelp ourselves after he turns in. Of course we’ll have to be mighty\r\ncareful. If the cap’n caught me tryin’ to git away, he might shoot me\r\ndown as a deserter,” went on the lanky sailor, solemnly.\r\n\r\nAfter that the boys, although trying outwardly to appear calm, were\r\nkeyed up to the utmost excitement. They looked around the forecastle\r\nfor some things which might hold drinking water and found a dozen or\r\nmore bottles and likewise the corks that had been in them. Then they\r\nfound a jug containing some vile-smelling liquor.\r\n\r\n“We can empty that jug when the time comes and fill that with water\r\nalso,” said Ralph. “We can tie it fast to the cable and let it slide\r\ndown to the motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“Gee, that’s an idea!” said Andy. “Maybe we can slide some other things\r\ndown, too. Then we can cut the cable and haul the stuff on board.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we had some chloroform to use on the whole bunch,” said Fred.\r\n“Then maybe they wouldn’t wake up until well in the morning, and by\r\nthat time we might be out of sight.”\r\n\r\nThat evening all of the boys ate frugally, stowing away as much of the\r\nmeal as they could in their pockets. Andy also watched his chance, and\r\ntook half a loaf of bread from one of the other tables which the cook\r\nhad served.\r\n\r\nAfter another conference with Ira Small, it was decided that Jack and\r\nRalph should aid the sailor in getting the gasoline. The others were to\r\nwatch their chance and enter the cook’s galley and confiscate anything\r\nthey could lay hands on in the way of food.\r\n\r\n“And don’t forgit the water,” warned Ira Small. “On the ocean that’s\r\nmore important than something to eat.”\r\n\r\n“We know all about that,” answered Fred.\r\n\r\nIt was not until nearly midnight that the boys managed to crawl forth\r\nfrom the forecastle one by one. Several of the sailors were asleep\r\nclose by, and the lads felt that all might be lost if any of these were\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to arm myself,” whispered Ralph. “And if anybody starts\r\nanything, I’m going to try to knock him in the head.”\r\n\r\nThe others thought this a good suggestion, and in the end every lad\r\npicked up whatever was handy in the way of a weapon. Then, watching\r\ntheir chance, one crowd made its way to the cook’s galley while the\r\nother slunk like shadows to the oil room at the bow.\r\n\r\nIt proved an easy matter to open the door of the oil room with the key\r\nIra Small had found. But it was not near so easy to run the gasoline\r\nfrom one of the barrels into the two ten-gallon cans. They did not dare\r\nmake a light for fear of an explosion, and it was difficult to work in\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\nBut at last they had the cans filled and then Ira Small led the way to\r\nthe deck once more.\r\n\r\n“Now each of you follow me and carry one of the cans,” he said. “I’ll\r\ngo ahead an’ see if the coast is clear. Don’t make no noise.”\r\n\r\nAs silently as a ghost the lanky sailor moved toward the stern of the\r\nschooner, on the lookout for any one who might be on deck. Not far\r\nbehind him came the two boys, each struggling with his ten-gallon can\r\nof gasoline, a weight by no means light.\r\n\r\n“Now go slow,” whispered Small, as he stepped back and brought the lads\r\nto a halt. “I don’t believe that fellow at the wheel is more’n half\r\nawake, but we don’t want to disturb him.”\r\n\r\nAs silently as possible, Ralph and Jack followed Small up the few steps\r\nleading to the stern deck. There in the semi-darkness they saw one of\r\nthe sailors leaning heavily on the wheel. He had been drinking freely\r\nthat evening, and for that reason was not near as alert as he might\r\notherwise have been.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the cabin they saw the swinging lamp was turned low, but\r\nno one was in sight, and they reasoned that the captain and the mate,\r\nas well as Ferguson, had retired.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the other boys had made their way to the cook’s\r\ngalley. It was so dark inside that they could not see a thing, and so\r\nwere compelled to light one of some matches which Randy had obtained\r\nfrom Small. Then they found a candle and lit this, shading it with\r\ntheir hands so that it might not let out any more light than was needed.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a pan of baked beans,” whispered Fred. “What about taking\r\nthose?”\r\n\r\n“Fine――if we can carry them,” answered Spouter.\r\n\r\n“Here are some old flour bags. Why can’t we put some of the stuff in\r\nthose?” suggested Fred, bringing the bags forward.\r\n\r\n“A good idea, Fred!” said Andy. “Let’s put all the stuff in bags; then\r\nwe can tie it over our shoulders and thus keep it out of the water as\r\nmuch as possible when we slide down that cable to the _Fancy_.”\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes the boys had collected a miscellaneous lot of\r\nfood, including the beans, several loaves of bread, some biscuits, some\r\ncanned vegetables, bacon, butter, cheese, coffee, condensed milk, sugar\r\nand some dried fruit. Everything was placed in the empty bags and in a\r\nbit of sail cloth they found tacked up over some shelves.\r\n\r\n“Now I guess we’ve got about all we can carry,” whispered Gif. “We\r\ndon’t want to overload ourselves nor stop ourselves from making a quick\r\nget-away.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were on the point of leaving the galley with their spoils when\r\nsuddenly they heard a noise outside and a moment later a burly form\r\ndarkened the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Who’s knockin’ round in my galley?” demanded the voice of the colored\r\ncook. “You-all ain’t got no right to take no food, and you know it! You\r\nhad your supper. Now you got to wait for breakfas’. Come out o’ there!”\r\n\r\nThe boys were so taken by surprise that for the instant they did not\r\nknow what to do. Then Gif whispered to Spouter:\r\n\r\n“Let’s try to capture him. If he raises an alarm, we’ll never get away.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Let’s jump him, boys!” called out Spouter to the others,\r\nand then leaped upon the cook, and Gif followed.\r\n\r\nThe colored cook was as much surprised as the boys had been, and before\r\nhe could recover from his astonishment he found himself dragged into\r\nthe galley and five boys doing their best to bear him to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi!” he sputtered. “What you-all up to? Stop that! Let go of me!”\r\n\r\n“Shut up! Don’t dare make a sound!” whispered Gif, in his ear. “Shut\r\nup!”\r\n\r\n“Who is you?” questioned the cook. “Is you one o’ those boys we done\r\ntook aboard the other day?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t keep quiet, we’ll heave you overboard,” added Fred,\r\nalthough he had no intention of doing anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n“Chile, chile! don’t heave me overboard!” groaned the cook. “I can’t\r\nswim! Let go of me! I ain’t done nothin’!”\r\n\r\nDuring their days on the schooner the boys had noticed a small hatch\r\nonly a few feet from the door to the galley. This hatch had been open\r\nto ventilate the hold, and Gif had looked down to find the spot beneath\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n“You keep quiet,” he ordered, and then he said to his chums: “I know\r\nwhat to do with him. As soon as I tell you to come out, bring him\r\nalong. And somebody had better put his hand over the fellow’s mouth for\r\nfear he may start to yell.”\r\n\r\nSlipping outside, Gif made his way to the small hatch and raised it.\r\nThen he called softly to the others, and they came outside, dragging\r\nthe cook with them. Randy had his hand over the fellow’s mouth, and it\r\nmust be confessed that the colored cook was thoroughly frightened.\r\n\r\n“Drop him down the hatchway, quick!” ordered Gif.\r\n\r\nWithout ceremony, this command was carried out, and the poor colored\r\ncook found himself shooting through utter darkness, to land in a heap\r\nin the hold of the schooner. Then the boys replaced the hatch and ran\r\nback into the galley to get the food they had packed up, and also the\r\nbottles and the jug of water. They were just starting for the stern\r\nwhen they found themselves confronted by Ira Small.\r\n\r\n“Got the stuff?” whispered the lanky sailor, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Andy.\r\n\r\n“I thought I heard a little noise up here.”\r\n\r\n“You did,” answered Gif. “We were spotted by the cook.”\r\n\r\n“And we dropped him down the hatchway over there,” added Spouter.\r\n\r\n“Good for you, lads! Good for you! Now come on――there ain’t no time to\r\nlose. That fellow hangin’ over the wheel may rouse up at any moment.\r\nBesides that, it’s almost time for the next man to take his trick.”\r\n\r\nOnce more Ira Small led the way to the stern of the _Hildegarde_. There\r\nthe other boys found that Jack and Ralph had provided themselves with a\r\nnumber of short pieces of rope.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to loop each of the oil cans fast to the cable leading\r\ndown to the motor boat,” explained Ralph. “You might as well loop all\r\nyour bundles also. Of course, a good deal of it will get wet, but\r\nthat can’t be helped. We can’t get it to the boat any other way while\r\nwe’re riding through these swells. We’ll be lucky to get on the boat\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nWhile the boys were looping the last of their bundles fast to the cable\r\nwhere, one after another, the bundles began to slide down from the\r\nstern of the schooner toward the motor boat, Ira Small drew back.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be with you in a couple o’ minutes,” he said. “You fellows kin\r\nfollow the stuff down the cable if you want to. But don’t cut it――I’ll\r\ndo that myself as soon as you’re safe on board and have salvaged the\r\nstuff.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor disappeared in the semi-darkness, and one after another the\r\nboys crawled over the stern of the _Hildegarde_ and caught hold of\r\nthe cable leading down over the ocean to where the motor boat rested.\r\nFortunately, both wind and waves had calmed down considerably, so that\r\nthe schooner was making but little headway.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter for the boys to reach the motor boat, and they\r\nwould have had great difficulty in getting aboard had it not been\r\nthat Captain Gilsen had left an arrangement on the craft so that a\r\nsailor from the _Hildegarde_ might get on board whenever it was deemed\r\nnecessary. This was a sort of rope ladder left across the bow with a\r\nline running from the cabin top to the cable just above the water line.\r\nFloundering around in the waves and the darkness, one after another of\r\nthe boys slid along the cable and finally managed to reach the motor\r\nboat. The last to come aboard was Jack, and it must be confessed that\r\nhe was almost spent with his exertions.\r\n\r\n“Are we all here?” questioned Gif, hanging fast to one side of the\r\ncabin, for they could not as yet get into the motor boat on account of\r\nthe tarpaulin lashed over the cockpit.\r\n\r\nEach lad quickly answered that he was there, for which the whole bunch\r\nwere thankful.\r\n\r\n“Now if only that sailor would come along, we could cut the cable and\r\nlet the schooner go on her way,” said Ralph, as they began to loosen\r\nthe tarpaulin.\r\n\r\n“Look! Look!” exclaimed Fred, excitedly. “Look at that light on the\r\nschooner!”\r\n\r\n“Fire! Fire!” was the sudden cry from the _Hildegarde_. “Everybody on\r\ndeck! The ship is on fire!” And as the boys gazed in consternation,\r\nthey saw the flames on the deck of the schooner mounting higher and\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        ON THE MOTOR BOAT AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n“The ship is on fire!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder how that happened?”\r\n\r\n“I bet that’s the work of Small!” cried Jack.\r\n\r\n“More than likely――unless we set fire to something in the galley,”\r\nreturned Fred.\r\n\r\n“Maybe that loose gasoline caught,” said Ralph. “Quite a lot of it\r\nspilled out on the oil-room floor in the darkness.”\r\n\r\nWhile the boys gazed at the flames on the _Hildegarde_ they saw Ira\r\nSmall rush to the stern. The next instant the lanky sailor was sliding\r\ndown the cable.\r\n\r\n“Quick! We ain’t got no time to spare!” gasped Ira Small, as he hauled\r\nhimself up to the motor boat. “Pull in on the cable and then cut it.\r\nBut don’t let the stuff on the line git away.”\r\n\r\nAll of the boys understood what was to be done, and Jack had already\r\nobtained a hatchet which was in one of the lockers of the motor boat.\r\nWhile Small, Gif and Spouter hauled in on the cable, Ralph and the\r\nothers continued to unloosen the tarpaulin. Then the young commander of\r\nthe _Fancy_ leaped into the cockpit and examined the motor.\r\n\r\n“Some water here, but still dry enough to run, I think,” he announced.\r\n\r\n“Wait! We don’t want to start up until we’ve cut loose!” cried Fred.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, Ralph. If you start up now we might bump into the schooner.\r\nShe isn’t making much headway,” added Randy.\r\n\r\nBy this time those at the bow had hauled in five or six yards of the\r\ncable. Then the heavy line was held down on the bow and Jack gave it\r\nseveral vigorous blows with the hatchet. The last accomplished its\r\npurpose, and the line snapped, the forward end whizzing back to the\r\n_Hildegarde_.\r\n\r\n“Now we can take the stuff aboard,” said Gif, and this was quickly\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nMany of the stores were soaked, a fact which did not please any of\r\nthem. But they were glad that they had the things. Otherwise it would\r\nhave been folly to attempt to escape in the motor boat. For all they\r\nknew, it might take them several days to reach land.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the flames on the deck of the _Hildegarde_ had\r\nmounted higher and higher, catching on a few of the tarred ratlines of\r\nthe mainmast.\r\n\r\n“Now hurry up an’ git that engine started!” cried Ira Small. “We want\r\nto git away while the goin’s good.”\r\n\r\nA lantern was lit and in a few minutes Ralph and one or two of the\r\nothers had the motor in working order. Then the battery was turned on,\r\nand in a second more the motor responded and a steady putt-putt greeted\r\nthe boys’ ears, much to their delight.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the wheel!” cried Jack. “You see that the motor does its\r\nduty, Ralph.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I think we’ll need some of that gasoline we brought along\r\nbefore a great while. You know, I said our supply was running low when\r\nwe were captured.”\r\n\r\nThe _Fancy_ was headed away from the schooner, and then, as near as\r\nhe was able, Jack steered for where he supposed the far-distant coast\r\nmight be located. In the meanwhile, the other lads and Ira Small rested.\r\n\r\n“Gee, but that was some get-away!” panted Andy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell the world!” came from Fred. “When I came down the cable I\r\nthought I would never reach the motor boat. Some strong pull to the\r\nocean!”\r\n\r\n“What can you tell us about that fire, Small?” demanded Gif.\r\n\r\nAt this question the lanky sailor chuckled hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Scart you, didn’t it? Well, I reckon it’s scarin’ those left aboard\r\nthe schooner; and that’s jest what I want. They’ll be so int’rested\r\nfightin’ that fire, they won’t think nothin’ about chasin’ us.”\r\n\r\n“Did you set the fire?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“I sure did, lad. But don’t git excited,” went on Ira Small. “It ain’t\r\ngoin’ to do the old _Hildegarde_ much harm. All I did was to spread\r\nsome excelsior soaked in gasoline on the deck near one o’ the rails.\r\nThey kin put the fire out easy enough. But they’ll have to work lively\r\nfor a few minutes to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure it won’t burn the ship so she’ll sink?” questioned\r\nFred, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“We wouldn’t want to leave those men to drown,” added Randy.\r\n\r\n“No sech luck, lad. You can’t drown a rascal who’s meant to be hung.\r\nNo, the fire’ll soon be out. You jest watch and see. But meanwhile,\r\nwe want to git as fur away from the schooner as possible. Now those\r\nrascals have got an idee they kin hold you fur a ransom, they won’t let\r\nyou escape if they kin help it.”\r\n\r\nWith the motor of the _Fancy_ running fairly well, Gif and Spouter\r\nturned their attention to bailing the craft. While this was being done\r\nFred and the twins stowed the food away in the cabin and saw to it that\r\nnothing might happen to their precious supply of water. Meanwhile,\r\nRalph opened one of the cans of gasoline and emptied the contents into\r\nthe supply tank of the motor boat.\r\n\r\n“There! That will carry us quite a few miles,” he declared. “Of course,\r\nhow many will depend on what kind of weather we strike and how the sea\r\nis running.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we can be thankful it’s so warm,” said Jack, doing his best\r\nat the wheel to make the _Fancy_ ride the waves without ducking those\r\naboard. “If it was as cold down here as it is around Cape Cod, I think\r\nwe’d all catch our death of cold.”\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad we’re wet,” said Gif. “But I suppose we’ve got to make\r\nthe best of that.”\r\n\r\nThey were soon out of sight of the schooner, save for the flames which\r\nshowed them a small part of the deck. As Ira Small had said, the fire\r\nsoon became lower and presently vanished completely.\r\n\r\n“I guess it’s out,” said Fred, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and I’m glad of it,” returned Randy.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I’ll bet they were scared for a few minutes,” came from Andy.\r\n\r\n“You can bet they are mighty mad at us,” was Spouter’s comment. “You\r\ncan be sure they’ll lay the fire at our door. They’ll say we wanted to\r\nburn the ship and drown them.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they’ll ever try and bring any o’ you fellows into court\r\nabout it,” chuckled Ira Small. “You’ve got too good a case ag’in’ ’em.”\r\n\r\nWith the extinction of the blaze on the _Hildegarde_, the only light\r\nanywhere around the motor boat vanished and the Rover boys and the\r\nothers found themselves plowing along slowly and uncertainly over the\r\nwide bosom of the Atlantic. Overhead there were drifting clouds, and\r\nonly a few stars could be seen.\r\n\r\n“P’int her a little more to starboard, lad,” advised Ira Small, as he\r\njoined Jack at the wheel. “I can’t give you the course direct, but I’ll\r\ndo my best.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ve often steered by the stars,” returned the young major.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did when I was on the old _Maria Deggett_,” answered the lanky\r\nsailor. “I took three trips in that four-master, an’ we sailed pretty\r\nnigh to ev’ry spot on the globe. She was a fine ship, an’ Cap’n Deggett\r\nhe was one fine man!”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you remain on her?” questioned Ralph.\r\n\r\n“She went ashore off the coast of Floridy in a hurricane. She was a\r\ntotal wreck, an’ that nigh broke ol’ Cap’n Deggett’s heart, an’ he\r\nnever went to sea no more. That was the trip when I heard all about\r\nthe thirteen rocks an’ the pirates’ hidden gold,” went on Ira Small,\r\nimpressively.\r\n\r\n“Do you really believe in that treasure?” questioned Fred, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I do, lad! It’s there, an’ I know it! All I’ve got to do is\r\nto locate them thirteen rocks.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to hear your yarn about it some day――when we’re out of this\r\ntrouble,” returned Fred.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the _Hildegarde_ behind, the boys had only one regret, and\r\nthat was that they had not recovered any of the things stolen from them.\r\n\r\n“But never mind,” said Jack, in speaking of this. “If we ever get the\r\nchance, we’ll make Captain Gilsen and Ferguson pay up!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and pay dearly!” added Gif. “Every one of those fellows ought to\r\nbe sent to prison.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow, we got our grub for nothing――not to mention the\r\ngasoline,” chuckled Andy. “It isn’t much, but it’s something.”\r\n\r\nNow that much of the excitement attending the escape from the schooner\r\nhad come to an end, the boys realized that they were both wet and\r\nsleepy. A small oil stove of which the cabin boasted was lit, and here\r\none after another they made themselves as comfortable as possible.\r\nThere chanced to be just one heavy raincoat aboard the craft, and this\r\nwas passed out to be used by the one who was on duty at the wheel.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take my trick at the wheel for a few hours,” announced Ira Small.\r\n“That’ll give you lads a chance to take a nap an’ dry yourselves. The\r\nmotor boat ain’t a schooner, but I reckon I kin manage it.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” answered Ralph, gratefully. “If anything goes wrong with\r\nthe engine, just call me.”\r\n\r\nThe boys retired to the cabin and there made themselves as comfortable\r\nas the limited quarters permitted. They hung some of their clothing\r\nclose to the oil stove and then, utterly worn out, sank down to rest\r\nwherever a place afforded.\r\n\r\nMorning found them still on the bosom of the broad Atlantic with\r\nneither a sail nor land in sight. The sun peeped out from behind a thin\r\nbank of clouds, and by its rays they set their course due west.\r\n\r\n“We’re bound to hit land sooner or later,” remarked Jack. “That is, if\r\nthe good weather and the gasoline hold out.”\r\n\r\n“How many miles can we travel with the gasoline we have on hand?”\r\nquestioned Fred of Ralph.\r\n\r\n“That’s a hard question to answer, Fred. You see, I’ve not been running\r\nthe _Fancy_ very long, and I don’t know what she can make in this sort\r\nof sea. You know it’s one thing to run in smooth water, and quite\r\nanother in the swells of the ocean. We lose a lot of our headway every\r\ntime the stern is lifted out of the water.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s hope, if it doesn’t carry us to land, that it will at\r\nleast carry us in the path of the ships sailing up and down the coast,”\r\nput in Spouter.\r\n\r\n“We’ll run straight for the first good-sized steamer we see,” answered\r\nRalph.\r\n\r\n“Don’t run into any more rum-runners,” warned Andy, with a sickly grin.\r\n“We’ve had enough of that class of rascals.”\r\n\r\nWith the coming of daylight, the boys and the lanky sailor felt better.\r\nA pot of coffee was gotten ready on the oil stove and cups of this\r\nbeverage passed around with some bread and biscuits served to make them\r\nstill lighter hearted.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we’ve got to be careful how we use up our grub and water,”\r\nwarned Jack. “There is no telling how long it has got to last us. For\r\nall we know, we may be much farther from shore than we imagine.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the morning wore away. About eleven o’clock Fred set up a shout.\r\n\r\n“What is that smoke just ahead of us?” he queried.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Spouter. “Looks like some smoke on an island.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a steamer!” came from Gif, a minute later. “A steamer! And she’s\r\nmoving northward.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s see if we can’t get close enough to hail her!” cried Jack,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nRalph was willing, and soon had the _Fancy_ running at her best rate of\r\nspeed. Then he took the wheel from Gif, who was steering.\r\n\r\n“Maybe I can manage her a little better,” he said. “You know, I’ve had\r\nmore experience.”\r\n\r\n“Go to it, Ralph,” answered Gif, readily. “I never was very much of a\r\nsailor.”\r\n\r\nThen began a mad race in the direction of the distant steamer. Would\r\nthey be able to get close enough to signal to those on board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                          A CRASH IN THE DARK\r\n\r\n\r\n“Are we getting any closer?”\r\n\r\nThe question came from Randy after at least a quarter of an hour had\r\npassed in their eager chase after the distant steamer which was moving\r\nslowly, leaving a long trail of black smoke in the air behind it.\r\n\r\n“We don’t seem to be making much progress,” answered Jack, dubiously.\r\n“What do you think, Ralph?”\r\n\r\nThe former major of the Colby Hall battalion shook his head while his\r\nface showed his disappointment.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid she’s getting away from us.”\r\n\r\n“That’s jest how it looks to me,” burst out Ira Small. “Guess she’s one\r\no’ them fast boats runnin’ from South America to New York.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we make some kind of a signal to her?” asked Fred. “Why not hang\r\na flag out upside down, or something like that?”\r\n\r\nSeveral flags were stowed away in one of the lockers, and now Old\r\nGlory was brought forth, and this several of the lads took turns in\r\nwaving wildly, keeping the stars at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe steamer was a goodly distance away, and it is doubtful if a\r\nsignal could have been seen without the aid of a glass. As it was,\r\nno attention was paid to the motor boat, and presently the big liner\r\npassed out of sight in the distance.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye to our first hope,” remarked Spouter, mournfully.\r\n\r\n“And may we have better luck next time,” said Fred, hopefully.\r\n\r\nSlowly the remainder of the day wore away. A little after noon they\r\nprepared a dinner of baked beans, canned corn and a few strips of\r\nbacon, washing this down with a little more coffee. They did not dare\r\nmake very much of the beverage because they wished to save their water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to cut out coffee altogether if we don’t sight something\r\nto-morrow,” warned Jack.\r\n\r\nToward evening they saw a sail in the distance. But night was coming\r\non and the sail soon disappeared in the darkness, and they found\r\nthemselves alone as before.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look as if I was ever goin’ to see them thirteen rocks an’ ketch\r\nsight of the pirates’ gold,” murmured Ira Small, dolefully. For the\r\ntime being his high spirits seemed to have deserted him.\r\n\r\n“I should think you’d be awfully sleepy, Small,” remarked Jack. “Why\r\ndon’t you turn in and see if you can’t get a good night’s sleep? You’ve\r\nhad hardly a wink since the night before we left the _Hildegarde_.”\r\n\r\n“Think I will turn in, if you fellows kin git along without me,”\r\nanswered the old sailor. “If anything unusual turns up, jest call me,”\r\nand he retired to the cabin and was soon snoring lustily.\r\n\r\n“He certainly is a character,” remarked Gif. “But I guess his heart is\r\nin the right place.”\r\n\r\n“He certainly proved himself our friend,” returned Jack. “If it hadn’t\r\nbeen for him, we might still be aboard the schooner. It would have been\r\nuseless for us to cut loose in the motor boat without the gasoline and\r\nthe grub.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think there is anything to his story about the thirteen rocks\r\nand the pirates’ gold?” questioned Andy. Tales of piratical treasure\r\nhad always appealed to the fun-loving Rover.\r\n\r\n“There may be something in it, Andy. Certainly the pirates existed. And\r\nif they got all the loot the books tell about, they must have either\r\nspent it or else hidden it somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but as far as I have ever heard, the great majority of the\r\nsearches for pirates’ treasures have been dead failures,” broke in\r\nSpouter. “I know, only a few years ago, a company was organized up in\r\nour neighborhood to look for a treasure said to be buried off the coast\r\nof Brazil. The promoters wanted my father to take stock in the concern,\r\nbut he refused. The crowd got together and went down to Brazil in a\r\nsteamer and spent two or three months looking for the gold, but didn’t\r\nfind a single doubloon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sometimes a treasure hunt proves a success,” said Jack. “Don’t\r\nforget how my father and Uncle Tom and Uncle Sam went down to the West\r\nIndies and located the Stanhope treasure.” He referred to a great\r\ntreasure search, the particulars of which have been given in the volume\r\nentitled, “The Rover Boys on Treasure Isle.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you told us about that, Jack,” answered Spouter. “And I’ve\r\nheard the particulars from my father, too. You know, he was with the\r\nexpedition.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s get the particulars of this treasure from Small,” said Randy.\r\n“We might organize an expedition just as our folks did,” he added, his\r\neyes glistening for the moment.\r\n\r\nThe boys took turns at steering the _Fancy_, and thus the greater part\r\nof the night wore away. Just as it was growing light in the east Fred,\r\nwho was at the wheel, uttered an exclamation of dismay.\r\n\r\n“What’s the trouble, Fred?” questioned Randy, who was coming out of the\r\ncabin to relieve him.\r\n\r\n“The motor just went dead.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she’s out of gasoline. Wait a minute till I take a look at the\r\ntank.”\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the gasoline tank of the craft showed that it still\r\ncontained a quart or more of the volatile fluid.\r\n\r\n“It’s in the engine, or else the battery has gone out of commission,”\r\nsaid Randy.\r\n\r\nNot caring to do too much to the engine without consulting Ralph, they\r\ncalled the young commander of the motor boat, and while Fred continued\r\nat the wheel in an endeavor to head up against the rolling billows,\r\nRalph and Randy commenced to hunt for the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe boys were still at this when, a little later, Jack and Andy\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“Looks to me like another storm,” said Jack, gazing eastward anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I’d say it was coming up pretty fast,” answered Andy.\r\n\r\nBefore the motor could be put into commission again the sky was\r\novercast and the wind began to come in strong, irregular puffs.\r\nThen, of a sudden, it began to rain, the big drops splashing in every\r\ndirection on the motor boat and the rolling waves.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I don’t like this!” exclaimed Ralph, as he took the wheel from\r\nFred. “Boys, I think we’re in for it.”\r\n\r\nSoon the waves were running much higher than before, and the _Fancy_\r\nbobbed up and down like a cork. It was next to impossible to make\r\nheadway in any direction.\r\n\r\n“Let me help you at the wheel, Ralph,” suggested Jack. “This is going\r\nto be something awful――worse than that fog we ran into.”\r\n\r\n“This is going to be a real storm, no mistaking that,” answered Ralph,\r\nand his face showed his anxiety. “We’ll be lucky if we don’t upset.”\r\n\r\nThe constant rolling of the _Fancy_ soon aroused Ira Small, and once\r\nawake the lanky sailor came outside in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid of it,” he said, gazing anxiously at the sky. “I felt it\r\nin my bones yesterday, but I didn’t want to scare none of you lads. I\r\nwas hopin’ we could git inshore before it come.”\r\n\r\nBy eight o’clock the storm was on them in all its violence. The _Fancy_\r\npitched and tossed so wildly that they could scarcely keep from going\r\noverboard, and Ralph advised that each one don a life-preserver, of\r\nwhich there was a supply in the forward locker.\r\n\r\n“Good idee,” said Ira Small. “Le’s put ’em on, by all means. They may\r\nsave our lives.” And so the life-preservers were adjusted by every one\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nWith such a storm in progress no one thought of breakfast. For fear of\r\nfire, the oil stove had been put out. Many of the loose articles aboard\r\nthe motor boat were either placed in the lockers or lashed fast. But\r\nbefore this was accomplished the _Fancy_ hit an extra heavy wave, and\r\nthis caused some of the canned goods and two of the bottles of water\r\nto bounce up from their resting-place in the cabin, smash two of the\r\nwindows, and roll overboard.\r\n\r\n“Gosh, this is something awful!” muttered Spouter. “We’ll be lucky if\r\nwe ever get out of it alive.”\r\n\r\nAll day long the storm continued. Occasionally the wind would let up\r\na little and they would have a breathing spell, for which they would\r\nbe thankful. But then the wind would blow as strongly as before, and\r\nthey would have to cling fast with might and main while the motor boat\r\nplunged and tossed as if every plunge might be her last. During that\r\ntime the boys and the sailor ate a few crackers and drank a little\r\nwater, but that was all.\r\n\r\n“If only some sort of sail would appear, or a steamer,” sighed Fred,\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say a word,” groaned Gif, who was a trifle seasick. “I’d give\r\nall I’m worth to be on land again.”\r\n\r\n“Same here,” added Spouter, promptly.\r\n\r\nAs night came on a new peril assailed them. Ira Small was at the\r\nwheel with Andy aiding him when, of a sudden, Ralph, who was somewhat\r\nforward, let out a yell of alarm.\r\n\r\n“Steer to the left!” he called. “Quick! We’re running into a mass of\r\nwreckage!”\r\n\r\nAs quickly as possible, Ira Small turned over the wheel of the motor\r\nboat. Then the craft arose to the top of a wave and the next instant\r\ncrashed into several good-sized spars and some other wreckage that\r\nfloated on the water.\r\n\r\nThe shock was such that several of the lads were thrown off their feet,\r\nand for the moment all of them thought the _Fancy_ was going to upset.\r\nBut Ira Small, bareheaded and with his scant locks flying in the wind\r\nand rain, kept manfully at the wheel, and soon the wreckage was left\r\nbehind and the _Fancy_ once more rode on an even keel.\r\n\r\n“I’ll say that was some bump,” remarked Spouter, when he could catch\r\nhis breath. “Gosh, I thought we were going to the bottom, sure!”\r\n\r\n“You fellows better see if we’ve sprung a leak,” called out the lanky\r\nsailor. “Sounded like a bad smash to me.”\r\n\r\nAs well as the bobbing boat permitted, Ralph and Jack crawled forward\r\nand made an examination of the bow. They found a bad crack just below\r\nthe water line through which the water was coming in a thin but broad\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to plug it up, somehow!” cried Jack. “Here, take this\r\nwaste! Hold it over the hole until I can get a knife.”\r\n\r\nJack crawled back into the cabin, and soon returned with an ordinary\r\ntable knife, and with this Ralph started to plug the waste into the\r\ncrack through which the ocean was pouring. It was hard work, and while\r\nRalph was at this Jack looked for more openings. He found one on the\r\nother side of the motor boat, a small hole into which he presently\r\npounded one of the bottle corks with the hatchet.\r\n\r\n“Looks bad, Ralph,” remarked the young major, when they returned to the\r\ncockpit.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how we’re going to get through the night,” was the\r\ndoubtful reply.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour or more passed, and the storm seemed to grow wilder and\r\nwilder. There was not so much rain, but the wind came in fierce gusts\r\nthat blew the spray all over the motor boat and its occupants. To stand\r\nup was impossible, and the lads crouched low, wondering what would\r\nhappen next. Ira Small was still at the wheel, and now Ralph went to\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly something dark and menacing loomed up before them. The next\r\ninstant the _Fancy_ struck the object with terrific force. Then the bow\r\nof the motor boat seemed to be split into several pieces. The craft\r\nturned over, and the next instant everybody on board found himself\r\nstruggling in the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                          ALONE ON THE OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upsetting of the motor boat came so swiftly and unexpectedly that\r\nnobody aboard had an opportunity to save himself. All were flung out\r\ninto the dark and turbulent water and several were hit by the object\r\nwith which the _Fancy_ had collided.\r\n\r\nAs Jack went overboard something struck him in the side, all but\r\nwinding him. He floundered around helplessly for several seconds, and\r\nhad it not been for the life-preserver he had donned it is possible\r\nthat he might have gone under never to rise.\r\n\r\nThe force of the waves speedily separated the boys and the lanky\r\nsailor, and when Jack was able to comprehend what had happened he found\r\nhimself practically alone on the bosom of the heaving ocean.\r\n\r\n“Hi, fellows! Where are you?” he managed to call out.\r\n\r\nBut only the wind and the slishing of the waves answered him. Then he\r\nstrained his eyes to the utmost, but not a soul seemed to be in sight.\r\nClose at hand was a short and thick spar, and to this the young major\r\nclung mechanically.\r\n\r\nHis heart was filled with horror. Was it possible that the others had\r\neither been killed by the collision or drowned? The thought was agony,\r\nand fervently he prayed that the others might be spared.\r\n\r\nAs the spar mounted to the top of a wave, Jack looked around again,\r\nand this time saw the dim outline of some dark object in the hollow\r\njust below him. Thinking it might be the wreck of the motor boat, he\r\nstruck out feebly, and presently gained the object, to find it a mass\r\nof wreckage, evidently a part of the forecastle or cabin of some small\r\nsailing ship.\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” came unexpectedly from the wreckage, and Jack was\r\ndelighted to recognize the voice of his cousin Fred.\r\n\r\n“It’s I――Jack!” gasped the young major, as he held fast to the\r\nwreckage. “Are you all right, Fred?”\r\n\r\n“Got a bump on my left shoulder, but it didn’t amount to a great deal,”\r\nanswered the youngest of the Rover boys. “Are you alone? Where are the\r\nothers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m alone; and I don’t know where the others are. Have you seen\r\nany of them?”\r\n\r\n“I saw Gif and Spouter just as we went overboard. But then something\r\nstruck me in the shoulder, and we became separated in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“The others can’t be far off――unless they went down,” went on the\r\nyoung major. And then, not without considerable difficulty, he managed\r\nto pull himself up beside his cousin on the wreckage, which formed\r\nsomething of a raft fifteen or twenty feet long and about half as wide.\r\n\r\n“If we only had a light,” said Fred, “maybe we could spot some of the\r\nothers. Oh, Jack, what will we do if they’ve been drowned?” and the\r\ntone of his voice showed his misery.\r\n\r\n“It’s terrible, Fred. I hate to think about it,” and Jack shuddered. He\r\nfelt that if his light-hearted cousins and his chums were drowned, life\r\nwould never be the same.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour dragged by dismally. The boys could think of\r\nnothing they might do to aid the others, and so sat close together,\r\nholding fast to the wreckage so that, as it pitched and tossed from the\r\ntop of one wave to the next, they would not be swept overboard. There\r\nwere occasional sheets of rain, and the wind blew as strongly as ever,\r\nsending the flying spray in all directions.\r\n\r\n“I saw something!” cried Fred, presently, while they were straining\r\ntheir eyes to pierce the gloom around them.\r\n\r\n“Where?” questioned his cousin, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“There! To the left! It’s gone now!”\r\n\r\n“What did it look like, Fred?”\r\n\r\n“I may be mistaken, but it looked like somebody floundering around in\r\nthe water.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s yell to him.” And then both boys cried out as loudly as their\r\nexhausted condition permitted.\r\n\r\n“Who’s calling? Where are you?” came from out of the darkness, and the\r\nnext instant the two boys saw the form of somebody on the top of a wave\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\n“Here we are――on some wreckage!” shouted Jack. “Be careful, or you’ll\r\nget struck!”\r\n\r\n“Help me! I’m almost done for!” gasped the swimmer, and for the moment\r\ndisappeared in the trough of the sea.\r\n\r\nThrowing himself flat on the wreckage, Jack crawled to the edge.\r\nA second later he saw an arm in the water and grasped it tightly.\r\nThen out of the briny deep came Ira Small, spluttering and kicking\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n“Save me! Save me!” he groaned. “I’m all in! I guess my right leg is\r\nbroke.”\r\n\r\nIn that pitching and tossing sea, it was no easy matter to haul the\r\ninjured sailor on to the wreckage. Twice he almost slipped from Jack’s\r\ngrasp, but finally he came up, and with Jack’s aid crawled to the\r\nmiddle of the improvised raft.\r\n\r\n“You done me a big service, lad. I’ll never forgit it,” mumbled Ira\r\nSmall, and then he all but fainted away.\r\n\r\n“Gee, it’s too bad if his leg is broken,” remarked Fred. “And we can’t\r\ndo anything for him, either.”\r\n\r\n“I guess he was about all in when he reached the raft,” returned Jack.\r\n“Another minute, and he would have gone down.”\r\n\r\nNow that they had found one of their companions, the two boys looked\r\naround more eagerly than ever for the others. Time and again they\r\ncalled out, and once they thought they heard a cry in return; but from\r\nwhence it came they could not determine, and soon the whistling wind\r\ndrowned out every other sound.\r\n\r\nAfter the rescue of Ira Small several hours went by――hours that the\r\nboys never forgot. The rude raft pitched and tossed as before, and\r\nwhile the rain stopped, the wind blew as fiercely as ever, showering\r\nthem continually with the ocean spray. Occasionally some small bits of\r\nwreckage hit that upon which they rested, and once a small spar rolled\r\nup on the raft, hitting Jack in the foot.\r\n\r\n“Some vessel must have gone to pieces either in this storm or the storm\r\nwe had before,” remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n“I hope some of the others got hold of the wreckage.”\r\n\r\n“So do I. But, Fred, this really doesn’t help us much. We must be miles\r\nand miles away from land; and without anything to eat or drink――――”\r\n\r\nJack did not finish what he had in mind to say. But both his cousin and\r\nIra Small understood.\r\n\r\n“It’s a terrible situation,” murmured the lanky sailor mournfully.\r\n“But I wouldn’t mind it so much if only my leg wasn’t hurt. What good\r\nis a sailor with a broken leg? No good at all!” and he shook his head\r\ndismally.\r\n\r\nHe was now sitting up on the wreckage with Fred on one side of him and\r\nJack on the other. All had on their life-preservers, and in addition\r\nthey clung fast to a rope which in some manner had become tangled on\r\nthe floating débris.\r\n\r\nNever had the two Rover boys felt more dismal. The mind of each\r\nreverted continually to Andy and Randy and to their school chums. Were\r\nthe others alive? Or had they seen the last of those they loved so well?\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jack! what will the folks at home say if Andy and Randy are\r\ndrowned?” whispered Fred.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” was the doleful reply. “I’d hate to break the news to\r\nUncle Tom and Aunt Nellie.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and think of Gif’s and Spouter’s folks and of the Masons!”\r\n\r\n“It’s too terrible to realize, Fred. Let’s hope for the best. It’s the\r\nonly thing we can do.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’ll go down too,” came lugubriously from the lanky sailor.\r\n“An’ then I won’t never find them thirteen rocks an’ the pirates’ gold.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind pirates’ gold now,” returned Jack, quickly. “I’d give every\r\ndollar of it if we were all safe and sound on land again.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t doubt it, lad. I don’t doubt it. Gold ain’t of no consequence\r\nto a man after he goes to Davy Jones’ Locker.”\r\n\r\nA little later came a moment of excitement. Another portion of wreckage\r\nloomed up before them, and then came a crash that all but sent them\r\ninto the ocean again.\r\n\r\n“Hold fast!” yelled Jack. “But look out that you’re not struck!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my leg! My poor leg!” moaned Ira Small, for he had been hit again,\r\nthis time by what appeared to be a piece of ship’s railing.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes the two pieces of wreckage continued to bob up and\r\ndown on the water. They bumped, and bumped again, and finally seemed to\r\nwedge themselves together into one uncertain whole.\r\n\r\n“There are a lot of ropes!” cried Ira Small. “Might as well lash all\r\nthe stuff together, lads. The bigger the raft, the safer it will be for\r\nall of us. I’d help, but I can’t do nothing with this busted leg.”\r\n\r\nBoth of the boys saw the ropes he mentioned, and set to work as best\r\nthey could to lash the two bits of wreckage together. This task took\r\nthem almost half an hour, and by that time they were gratified to see\r\nthat dawn was almost at hand and that soon the sun would be showing\r\nitself over the eastern rim of the ocean.\r\n\r\n“I wish it was daylight,” sighed Fred.\r\n\r\n“So do I,” answered the young major.\r\n\r\n“Even if a ship was near by we’d be unable to see it in this darkness.”\r\n\r\n“How do you feel, Fred, worn out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But that isn’t the worst of it, Jack. I can’t get the others out\r\nof my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Neither can I. If only―――― Oh!”\r\n\r\nThe talk came to a sudden end as some more wreckage hit them. All were\r\non their guard, not wishing to be flung overboard. But presently the\r\nother wreckage slid away in the darkness, much to their relief.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of daylight the wind seemed to go down a little. But\r\nthe waves were as high as ever, and every few minutes those on the\r\nwreckage found themselves covered with the flying spray.\r\n\r\nOn the second bit of wreckage the boys had found two blankets, and\r\nthese they placed under the lanky sailor, so that he might rest more\r\ncomfortably. Then Jack made an examination of the hurt leg.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t seem to be broken to me,” he said. “But it’s certainly\r\nhorribly bruised. You’ll have to be very careful of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be thankful if it ain’t broke,” was the reply. “But it\r\ncertainly hurts an awful lot. Wish I had a drink of water.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like a drink myself,” said Fred. “But we haven’t got any water, so\r\nwhat’s the use of thinking about it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity we didn’t think to save a little of the water while it was\r\nrainin’, lad. Even a mouthful or two might mean a whole lot to us later\r\non.”\r\n\r\nAs the sun came up over the eastern ocean, the boys gazed eagerly in\r\nall directions. Here and there they could see bits of wreckage――boxes,\r\nbarrels, floating spars, and what looked to be the bow of a fair-sized\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\n“Some vessel has certainly gone to pieces, and not very long ago,\r\neither,” remarked Jack. “But I don’t see anything that looks like a\r\nhuman being; do you, Fred?”\r\n\r\n“I see something!” cried his cousin, excitedly. “Look over there, Jack!\r\nWhat is that?”\r\n\r\nThe young major looked in the direction indicated, and then drew a\r\nsharp breath.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s somebody on some wreckage!” he exclaimed. “And they are\r\nsignaling to us!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                           FACING STARVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that some of the other castaways had been sighted filled even\r\nIra Small with intense interest.\r\n\r\n“How many of ’em?” he queried.\r\n\r\n“I can’t make out exactly,” answered Fred. “But I think there are two,\r\nand maybe three.”\r\n\r\n“I see only two,” came from Jack. “There they go!”\r\n\r\nThe wreckage in the distance had disappeared behind a big wave. But\r\nsoon the Rover boys and the sailor saw it come into view again, and now\r\nsomewhat closer than before.\r\n\r\n“There are two on it――that’s all!” exclaimed the young major. “One\r\nstanding up and the other sitting down.”\r\n\r\n“Can you make out who they are?” questioned the sailor.\r\n\r\n“I think the fellow standing up is Randy, but I’m not certain,” said\r\nFred. And then he set up a yell in which Jack joined.\r\n\r\nFor fully a quarter of an hour the two pieces of wreckage bobbed up\r\nand down on the broad bosom of the Atlantic. Sometimes Jack and Fred\r\nthought they were coming a little closer together, and then it looked\r\nas if they might be drifting farther apart.\r\n\r\n“It’s Randy! I’m sure of it!” exclaimed Fred, presently.\r\n\r\n“You’re right!” answered his cousin. “And the fellow sitting down――I’m\r\nalmost positive――is Andy. He must be hurt, or he wouldn’t keep sitting\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe he got his leg hurt, jest like I did,” came mournfully from Ira\r\nSmall.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an anxious half hour, the two pieces of wreckage were\r\nnot over fifty yards apart. Jack and Fred could now see Randy and Andy\r\nquite distinctly, and called to them.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you swim over?” cried Jack. “We can’t come to you because Small\r\nis hurt.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WE CAN’T COME TO YOU BECAUSE SMALL IS HURT.”]\r\n\r\n“I’m hurt too,” answered Andy. “I got my ankle twisted when I fell out\r\nof the motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got an idea,” called the young major, suddenly. “Maybe I can\r\ncarry a line over to you, and then we can tie the pieces of wreckage\r\ntogether. We did that to another piece that bumped into us.”\r\n\r\nTaking one of the ropes, Jack saw to it that one end was securely\r\nfastened to the edge of the wreckage upon which he stood. Then\r\ndivesting himself of most of his clothing, he leaped into the ocean and\r\nbegan to swim with might and main for the other improvised raft, which\r\nwas made up of part of a schooner’s stern.\r\n\r\nAs my old readers know, Jack had always been a good swimmer――in fact,\r\nall of the Rover boys could swim well――but he soon discovered that\r\nswimming in a river or a lake was an entirely different matter from\r\nmaking headway in the rolling Atlantic. One minute he felt that he was\r\non the top of a high hill and the next that he was going down into a\r\nbottomless hollow.\r\n\r\nBut he kept on vigorously, and soon came so close to the other piece of\r\nwreckage that Randy could almost reach him.\r\n\r\n“Be careful, Jack,” was the warning. “If you get struck in the head it\r\nmay knock you senseless.”\r\n\r\nAt last, after several minutes of maneuvering, the young major, with\r\nhis cousin’s assistance, managed to scramble up on the wreckage.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I’m glad that’s over!” he panted. “It looked like an easy stunt\r\nwhen I started; but it proved to be anything but that!”\r\n\r\n“Say, don’t you know a shark might have come up after you?” questioned\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t think of sharks until I was half way over,” was the reply.\r\n“And as none appeared, there is no use of worrying about it. Is the\r\nankle very bad, Andy?”\r\n\r\n“It’s so bad that I can’t stand on it. But never mind that, Jack. I’m\r\nmighty glad to see you and Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything about Gif, Spouter and Ralph?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“I do not. None of us saw a thing of them after the boat turned over.”\r\n\r\n“We saw them for a few minutes,” said Randy. “Gif had hold of a\r\nspar that I grabbed, and Ralph and Spouter were on another piece of\r\nwreckage. Then I slipped and went down, and when I came up I hit this\r\npiece of wreckage and joined Andy.”\r\n\r\nIt was quickly decided to bring the pieces of wreckage together if it\r\ncould be accomplished in safety. Ira Small ordered Fred to stand by\r\nwith a small spar to use as a fender if necessary, and then called\r\nsimilar directions to Randy. Then Jack watched his chance and pulled in\r\non the line.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes matters looked rather serious as the bits of\r\nwreckage came together with a crash, then swept apart and came together\r\nwith another crash. But finally several pieces of rope were lashed\r\nfast under Ira Small’s directions, and then Randy and Jack were able to\r\nassist Andy to a place on the blankets beside the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Now lash all the wreckage together as tight as you possibly kin,” said\r\nIra Small. “Then we’ll have a purty respectable kind of a raft to float\r\naround on. I kin tell you, this wreckage is a God-send to us,” he went\r\non solemnly. “If it hadn’t been fur it, we’d all be at the bottom of\r\nthe ocean by this time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but if it were not for the wreckage, the motor boat wouldn’t have\r\nbeen smashed,” put in Andy.\r\n\r\n“Well, lad, I s’pose that’s so, too,” admitted Ira Small, nodding his\r\nhead gravely.\r\n\r\nNow that they were together once more, the four Rover boys felt\r\nsomewhat better. Yet they continued to worry over the disappearance of\r\ntheir three chums.\r\n\r\n“It will certainly be an awful thing if they don’t show up,” remarked\r\nRandy. “Just think of how their folks will feel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and think how we’ll feel!” came from Fred, and his face showed\r\nhis downheartedness.\r\n\r\nAndy and Randy brought with them one thing which was a little comfort.\r\nOn their wreckage they had found a piece of sail several yards square,\r\nand during the rain they had caught a few cupfuls of water. From this,\r\nas the morning wore on, each took a sip.\r\n\r\nIt was found that Andy’s ankle was much swollen. The other boys bathed\r\nit for him and then bound it up with a strip of the sailcloth. They\r\nperformed the same services for Ira Small.\r\n\r\n“We’re in the sick-bay, lad,” said the lanky sailor dubiously to Andy.\r\n“I reckon we’ve got to make the best of it. Howsomever, luck’s been\r\nwith us so far, an’ mebby luck’ll see us through.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the afternoon wore away. By this time all aboard the wreckage\r\nwere hungry, but the most that anybody could offer was a water-soaked\r\npackage of chewing gum which Andy found in a pocket of his jacket.\r\n\r\n“I think we’ll find that too salty to chew, Andy,” said Jack. “I\r\nwouldn’t touch it. It will make you thirstier than ever.” So the\r\nwater-soaked chewing gum went unused.\r\n\r\nAt last night came on. So long as it was light, everybody aboard the\r\nwreckage kept his eyes on the alert for some sign of the other three\r\nboys and for some craft that might pick them up.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I wouldn’t care even if the old _Hildegarde_ hove in sight,” said\r\nRandy, at last. “If we were on board that tub, we’d at least have\r\nsomething to eat and to drink and a place to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“No more o’ that schooner fur me!” cried Ira Small. “I’d rather jump in\r\nthe ocean than go aboard her ag’in,” and his eyes flashed angrily.\r\n\r\nWhen night settled down they found themselves absolutely alone on that\r\npart of the wide ocean. Even the bits of wreckage which had surrounded\r\nthem had disappeared. Nothing was to be seen on every side but the\r\nheaving waters.\r\n\r\n“Gosh, if we ever get off of this and on dry land once more, I won’t\r\nwant to look at the ocean again for years,” murmured Randy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be like the fellow who got seasick and said the next boat he’d\r\ntake would be a Pullman car,” put in Andy, with a faint grin.\r\n\r\nIn such a perilous position, with the wreckage heaving up and down\r\non the water, sleep was almost out of the question. Occasionally one\r\nor another would doze off, to awaken with a start as the uncertain\r\nflooring beneath him gave an extra lurch or an ominous crack. They\r\ndid not know whether the ropes they had used would hold the wreckage\r\ntogether. If it parted, they might at any instant find themselves again\r\nfloundering around in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBefore morning came, the ominous clouds began to gather once more, and\r\nnow the wind came up in fitful gusts. In a little while the wreckage\r\nwas bobbing up and down and creaking fitfully.\r\n\r\n“If only we had a few more strong ropes,” said Ira Small. “Those we\r\nhave are good enough if the weather stays calm, but I’m afraid a heavy\r\nstorm would prove too much of a strain on ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe day proved one of alarming uncertainty. The heavy clouds soon\r\nbrought on more rain, and the wind became almost as violent as it had\r\nbeen the day before. Anxiously all of the boys and the lanky sailor\r\nwatched the ropes that held the wreckage together.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, we can get a drink out of this, maybe,” said Randy, and\r\nhe and the others spread the canvas so that they might catch as much of\r\nthe rain as possible.\r\n\r\nThey swallowed the liquid eagerly. It did not help their hunger, but it\r\ncut off that awful thirst which was little short of maddening.\r\n\r\nThus another night was spent on the wreckage. By this time their hunger\r\nhad become acute. Andy and the old sailor suffered the most, because of\r\ntheir hurts.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I can’t stand this much longer, Randy,” said Andy to his twin, at\r\nlast. “I feel as if I was getting sick all over.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Andy, that I can’t do anything more for you,” was the\r\nbrotherly response. “But there isn’t a thing here to work with.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know that! It’s not your fault, Randy,” and Andy said no more.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while no one seemed to feel like talking. A gaunt\r\nspectre arose in the mind of every one on the wreckage――the spectre of\r\nStarvation. With nothing to eat, how much longer could they live?\r\n\r\n“Maybe we would have been better off if we had gone down in the first\r\nplace,” thought Jack. “It’s better to die quickly than to die by\r\ninches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                        ABOARD THE STEAM YACHT\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly the forenoon passed. Again all scanned the horizon eagerly.\r\nTwice they thought they saw sails in the distance, and once caught\r\nsight of a trail of smoke left by some steamer. But no craft came close\r\nenough to be signaled. Nor did they see any more of the wreckage.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid the other fellows have gone to the bottom,” said Fred, and\r\nhis voice trembled as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Well, there ain’t much ch’ice between bein’ drowned an’ starvin’ to\r\ndeath,” came from Ira Small. His thin face was thinner than ever and\r\nhis eyes burned with a peculiar fire.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I hope Small doesn’t go crazy,” whispered Randy to Jack. “I’ve\r\nheard some people do that when they get too hungry.”\r\n\r\n“He certainly looks pretty wild, Randy,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you feel a bit dizzy, Jack? I do.”\r\n\r\n“I’m trying not to think of being hungry,” said the young major. “It’s\r\nthe only way out as far as I can see.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes more passed and then, of a sudden, Ira Small leaped to\r\nhis feet, pointing his long, bony hand ahead of him.\r\n\r\n“There’s another wreck!” he called out. “Looks like a steam yacht, too!”\r\n\r\nAll gazed in the direction indicated and saw that Ira Small was right.\r\nThe wreck, which was quite a distance away, disappeared in a hollow of\r\nthe ocean, but a moment later came up on the crest of a wave.\r\n\r\nIt was a steam yacht, but both of the masts were broken off just above\r\nthe deck, one dangling partly over the side, held by a number of ropes.\r\nThe bow of the yacht was smashed in, and a goodly portion of the\r\nstarboard rail had been carried away.\r\n\r\n“She’s been in a collision, that’s sure!” cried Jack.\r\n\r\n“Maybe she smashed into the ship the wreckage of which hit the _Fancy_,”\r\nsuggested Fred.\r\n\r\n“That might be so, lad,” said the old sailor, still standing up, in\r\nspite of his hurt leg.\r\n\r\n“Let’s yell and wave our hands!” cried Andy. “I’d rather be on a boat\r\nlike that, even if she is all battered up, than on this wreckage.\r\nBesides that, we want something to eat――and mighty quick, too!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anybody on the deck,” came from Randy.\r\n\r\nAll looked eagerly toward the battered steam yacht. The craft was of\r\ngood size and tilted over to port and up at the bow.\r\n\r\n“Looks to me like the yacht had been abandoned,” said Ira Small. “Look,\r\nlads! All the small boats are missin’. I’ll bet after she was struck\r\nthe cap’n thought she was goin’ down, an’ so abandoned his ship.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the steam yacht came closer. She was considerably water-logged,\r\nand now the Rover boys and the sailor saw that her bow was greatly\r\ndamaged and that part of the forward deck had also been torn up.\r\n\r\n“She must have been in a terrible smash, whatever it was,” remarked\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and she may have cut the other boat clean to pieces,” answered\r\nRandy. “Just look at all the wreckage we got into!”\r\n\r\n“But if she hit that boat, why didn’t we see the yacht before?” queried\r\nFred. “She was right on the same spot.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must remember, this here wreckage is from a small sailin’\r\nship,” answered the lanky sailor. “That there yacht probably has\r\na good engine aboard, and maybe after the collision the cap’n put\r\non full steam, thinkin’ he could make land. Then the vessel got so\r\nwater-logged he was afraid she was goin’ down, and so he and his crew\r\nand his passengers, if he had any, took to the boats. But I want to say\r\none thing,” he went on impressively: “She’s the funniest lookin’ steam\r\nyacht I ever saw. Look at that queer house on deck, and look at them\r\nqueer portholes along the side. Maybe she’s a hospital ship.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we could get aboard to find out,” came from Andy. His hunger\r\nwas making him desperate.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a good mind to try to swim over to her,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“If you go, I’ll go along,” answered Randy, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you try it, each of you’d better take two life-preservers,”\r\nsuggested Ira Small. “Then, when you git tired of swimmin’, you kin\r\nrest yourselves. It ain’t no mean distance to that there vessel.\r\nDistances on the water are mighty deceivin’.”\r\n\r\n“What about sharks?” asked Fred.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to run that risk,” answered Jack. “I’d just as lief be food\r\nfor sharks as to starve to death,” he added desperately.\r\n\r\nA little later, each wearing two life-preservers, Jack and Randy struck\r\nout for the water-logged steam yacht, which was moving slowly on the\r\nrolling bosom of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n“Don’t hurry, Randy,” cautioned the young major. “It may be a long\r\nswim, and there is no use of our getting winded. Take it easy. It may\r\nget us there quicker in the end.”\r\n\r\nThe two Rover boys made slow progress, and at the end of a quarter of\r\nan hour the water-logged steam yacht seemed to be almost as far away as\r\never.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t look as if we were going to make it, does it, Jack?”\r\nquestioned his cousin, as he stopped swimming for a moment. His looks\r\nshowed his disappointment.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ll get there sooner or later,” Jack answered, as cheerfully as\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nThey resumed their swimming, and a few minutes later saw, to their\r\ndelight, that the rolling ocean was bringing the strange vessel closer\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n“Look out that you don’t get struck!” cried Jack, when the steam yacht\r\nloomed up just ahead of them. “She’s bobbing around pretty lively,\r\nin spite of being water-logged. Try to grab one of those ropes on the\r\nbroken mast.”\r\n\r\nAs the two youths drew closer they could hear the swash of the ocean as\r\nit struck the sides of the water-logged boat. But mingled with these\r\nsounds came others that made them look at each other in wonder.\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose that noise is?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Maybe some people in distress.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe the steam yacht is a hospital ship, as Small said.”\r\n\r\nThe strange noise continued to come from the water-logged steam yacht,\r\nbut what it could be the boys could not surmise. As the vessel surged\r\ncloser, each caught hold of the ropes which held the broken mast and\r\nthen did his best to pull himself up to the slanting deck above.\r\n\r\n“Be careful!” called out Randy. “These ropes may give way and let us\r\nand the mast down in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they’ve held so long, I guess they’ll hold a little longer,”\r\nanswered Jack. “Up you go!”\r\n\r\nA minute later the two Rover boys stood on the deck of the water-logged\r\nvessel. The craft was so badly listed that they moved around with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“Not a soul in sight, dead or alive,” murmured Jack, after they had\r\ngazed up and down the long deck.\r\n\r\n“Do you notice anything funny in the way of a smell?” questioned his\r\ncousin, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I certainly do!” Jack gave a sniff. “Smells something like a stable.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe she’s a cattle boat.”\r\n\r\n“That might be, Randy. But come on, we might as well take a look around\r\nand see if anybody is in charge. And we want to see, too, what we can\r\ndo about getting the others on the wreckage aboard.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we can find some kind of small boat. They may not have taken all\r\nof them,” was the hopeful response.\r\n\r\nNot only did the deck slope at a dangerous angle, but it was also\r\nexceedingly slippery, so that it was with great difficulty that the\r\nboys managed to move around. It had been the foremast that hung by the\r\nboard, and they had come aboard close to where rested the remains of\r\nthe smashed-in bow.\r\n\r\n“There is that noise again!” exclaimed Randy, while they were moving\r\namidships. “What in the world can it be!”\r\n\r\n“Some animals, I guess,” answered his cousin. “They may have some\r\nhorses or cows or sheep, or something like that, on board. Come on,\r\nlet’s investigate. This thing is getting on my nerves.”\r\n\r\nThe cousins moved with caution to the middle portion of the yacht.\r\nHere were the remains of a deckhouse, smashed flat by the fall of the\r\nmainmast, which was now missing. Behind this was a cabin, the door and\r\nwindows of which were all tightly closed.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Hello!” yelled Jack, at the top of his lungs. “Anybody on\r\nboard? Hello!”\r\n\r\nJack had scarcely uttered the call when from below the deck came a\r\npandemonium of sounds that fairly made the two lads jump. There were\r\nroars and moans, and a shrill chattering that made their hair feel as\r\nif it would stand on end.\r\n\r\n“My stars, Jack! what kind of a boat is this?” gasped Randy, as he\r\nclutched his cousin by the arm.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” was the short reply, and Jack looked at his cousin\r\ncuriously. Had their extreme hunger and thirst affected their minds and\r\nwere they simply imagining things?\r\n\r\nThey looked back to the wreckage they had left, and to their\r\nsatisfaction saw that it was less than half as far away as it had been\r\nwhen they had left it to swim over to the steam yacht.\r\n\r\n“Thank fortune, it’s coming this way!” breathed Randy. “I hope it\r\ndoes――that may save us a lot of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Provided we want to stay aboard this ship,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“Why, what do you mean by that? Don’t you think it’s safe?” asked his\r\ncousin, in alarm.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think, Randy. Either we’re bewitched, or this\r\nboat has got the queerest cargo aboard I ever heard of. Just listen to\r\nthat roaring and moaning and chattering! Did you ever hear anything\r\nlike it in your life?”\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi! Can’t you throw us a line?” came suddenly from the wreckage,\r\nand now they saw that it was floating still closer.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see if we can’t tie fast to the wreckage before we do anything\r\nelse,” said Jack. “We don’t want it to float off on the other side of\r\nthe yacht.”\r\n\r\nTheir fears forgotten for the moment, the two cousins set to work and\r\nsoon found a long line which might answer their purpose. They cast this\r\nline out as far as they could, not once, but many times, and at last\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing it caught by Fred and the old sailor.\r\nThen to the light line they attached a fair-sized hawser, and this\r\nwas speedily hauled down to the wreckage, which in a few moments more\r\nbumped into the side of the steam yacht and was secured there.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I’m glad to be over here!” cried Fred. “Hurry up! Help me get\r\nAndy and Small aboard. Is there anybody alive on the yacht?”\r\n\r\n“We don’t know what’s aboard yet,” answered Jack, anxiously. “We’re\r\nhearing all sorts of strange sounds. Just listen!”\r\n\r\nAll listened, and suddenly the face of Ira Small took on a knowing look.\r\n\r\n“By gum! I know what this craft is,” he exclaimed. “I’ve heard of her\r\nbefore. She’s a menagerie ship!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                       ANIMALS, BIRDS AND SNAKES\r\n\r\n\r\n“A menagerie ship?” queried Randy.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, lad. Those must be wild animals you hear. An’ mebby\r\nsome monkeys,” added the lanky sailor, listening to the roaring and\r\nchattering. “Are any of ’em loose?”\r\n\r\n“So far we haven’t seen anything that’s alive,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“Well, we might as well go aboard,” called Andy. “If there are any wild\r\nanimals loose, though, I don’t know what we’re going to do.”\r\n\r\nThe wreckage was pounding so hard and constantly against the side of\r\nthe steam yacht, nobody cared to remain upon it, and so with all the\r\ncare possible Andy and the old sailor were helped to the deck above,\r\nand then Fred followed them.\r\n\r\n“Better not cut the wreckage loose just yet,” advised Jack. “We may\r\nwant to get on it in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Gee! do you think those wild animals might get loose and chase us\r\naround?” questioned Fred.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think, Fred. We haven’t had a chance to look the\r\nboat over. I guess the best thing we can do first is to arm ourselves.”\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to find anything in the way of clubs, because\r\nthe storm had swept the deck of the steam yacht almost clean. But they\r\nfinally managed to break out some pieces of wood from the wreckage at\r\nthe bow, and from these made a number of heavy sticks.\r\n\r\n“You two had better stay near the ladder leading to the roof of the\r\ncabin,” said Jack to Ira Small and Andy. “Then, if there’s any trouble,\r\nyou can climb up there somehow to safety. There is no use of staying\r\ndown on the deck with those game legs of yours.”\r\n\r\nThe two injured ones did as advised, and then the others moved around\r\ncautiously to the cabin door. Opening it inch by inch, Jack peered into\r\nthe compartment to find it deserted.\r\n\r\n“Nothing here!” he exclaimed, and walked into the cabin, followed\r\nimmediately by Fred and Randy.\r\n\r\nThe place was in great disorder, showing that those aboard the steam\r\nyacht had evidently left in a hurry. Lockers stood wide open, much\r\nof the contents strewn in all directions. On the floor lay a number\r\nof dishes along with some knives, forks and spoons, evidently swept\r\nfrom the cabin table by the hurry of those who were escaping from the\r\nvessel or by the action of the storm. Around the cabin were a number of\r\nstaterooms, some of the doors of which stood wide open, and here the\r\nsame disorder prevailed.\r\n\r\n“I suppose they didn’t have much time in which to leave,” was Jack’s\r\ncomment. “They probably grabbed what they could lay hands on and ran\r\nfor the boats.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anything to eat around here!” exclaimed Fred. “Let’s find\r\nthe cook’s galley.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s some drinking water, anyhow,” came suddenly from Randy, as he\r\ncaught sight of a cooler on a stand at the end of the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe cooler was almost full, and the three lads lost no time in getting\r\nall the water they wanted. Then they picked up a pitcher from the floor\r\nand filled this, and Fred took it to Andy and the lanky sailor.\r\n\r\n“Gosh, that tastes like heaven!” said Ira Small, as he smacked his\r\nlips. “Now if I had a bite to eat, I think I’d feel like a new man.”\r\n\r\n“You never know how good water is until you have to do without it,”\r\nremarked Andy.\r\n\r\nHaving assured themselves that there was no cook’s pantry attached\r\nto the cabin, the three boys came out on deck again, and then went\r\non a hunt for the cook’s galley. This was soon located, and much to\r\ntheir satisfaction they came upon a quantity of food which made their\r\neyes sparkle in anticipation. There were all sorts of canned goods,\r\nboth fish and meats as well as vegetables, and in addition boxes of\r\ncrackers, sides of bacon, and canisters of tea, coffee, cocoa, and also\r\nsalt, sugar, rice and a great variety of other articles.\r\n\r\n“We can’t cook anything on that stove――at least not the way it’s\r\nstanding,” said Randy, pointing to the tilted-up kerosene stove of\r\nwhich the galley boasted.\r\n\r\n“I am hungry enough to eat a cold meal,” came quickly from Fred, who\r\nwas already munching a cracker. “Come on, let’s take some of this stuff\r\nto Andy and that sailor. They’re just as starved as we are.”\r\n\r\nWith their hands full of good things, the three boys made their way to\r\nthe top of the cabin, and soon the whole crowd were regaling themselves\r\nwith the first meal they had eaten for several days. They broke open\r\nseveral cans of soup, and though the soup was cold, it tasted better to\r\nthem than any meal they had ever eaten.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what――hunger is the great sauce,” declared Jack, as he\r\nmunched his sixth cracker. “At home we’d probably turn up our noses at\r\nthis, but here――wow!”\r\n\r\nWhile they were eating they discussed the situation, but could arrive\r\nat no conclusion as to what would be their next best move.\r\n\r\n“We can’t do much of anything, lads, until we have examined the ship,”\r\ndeclared Ira Small. “For all we know, she may be leakin’ so fast that\r\nshe’s liable to go down at any time.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, the best thing we can do is to put a supply of grub and\r\nwater on the raft and make the raft as substantial as possible,” cried\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t be no bad idee, lad. That wreckage did us a mighty good\r\nturn. We kin lash all the timbers together with a few more ropes, an’\r\ngit some kind of a spar for a mast, an’ then hoist a sail if we have\r\nto leave the yacht. But examine the ship first――it might not be so bad\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\nThe thought that the steam yacht might go down suddenly filled the\r\nRovers with a new dread, and in spite of the old tar’s last words,\r\nthey decided to pack a lot of the ship’s stores in some sailcloth, the\r\nbundle being then hung over the side where it could be lowered to the\r\nwreckage without much trouble. Then they found a cask filled with\r\ndrinking water, and placed this near the rail.\r\n\r\n“Now if the worst comes to worst, we’ll have something to rely on,”\r\ndeclared Jack. “I don’t think she’ll go down so fast but what we’ll\r\nhave time to get that stuff aboard the wreckage. Then we can take a lot\r\nof ropes along and other things and fix the raft up after we’ve shoved\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nHaving eased their minds about the food and the water, Jack, Randy and\r\nFred continued their inspection of the yacht.\r\n\r\n“I’m rather afraid to go below on account of what may be loose down\r\nthere,” said Fred.\r\n\r\nThey found a door, and beyond this there was a sort of runway, or\r\ngangplank, leading to the deck below. As the ship was on so much of\r\na slant, it was no easy matter for the boys to get down, and they\r\nadvanced with caution, Jack holding up before him a ship’s lantern he\r\nhad found and lit.\r\n\r\nThe smell of wild animals was powerful below decks, and the sounds\r\nthey had heard above were now increased tenfold. Close at hand were a\r\nnumber of empty stalls, or cages. But presently they came upon one cage\r\ncontaining a live tiger. Farther on were several more tigers and also\r\nfour lions. Then came a number of leopards and other wild beasts, some\r\nof which the boys were unable to identify.\r\n\r\nThis was on the upper side of the vessel. On the lower side were two\r\ncages of monkeys, three of parrots, and several heavy wire cages the\r\noccupants of which made the boys draw back in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“Snakes!” cried Fred, in disgust. “What do you know about that? Great\r\nbig snakes!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and look at the number of them!” returned Randy. “There must be\r\nfifteen or more. Just look at that big brown thing! He’s as thick as my\r\narm and at least ten feet long.”\r\n\r\n“This certainly is a menagerie ship, and no mistake,” came from Jack,\r\nand then he added: “I suppose those poor beasts haven’t had anything to\r\neat or drink since the crash came. We ought at least to give them some\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s a hogshead full of water,” said Fred, “and half a dozen pails.\r\nWe might as well give them a drink while we’re at it.”\r\n\r\nThe hogshead, even though on a slant, was more than half full of water,\r\nand into this the lads dipped the pails, and soon all of the animals\r\nwere supplied. At once they stopped their roaring and growling, and set\r\nabout satisfying their thirst.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the ship the boys discovered a dozen sheep and\r\ngoats, and also a cage of live rabbits. In a closet they discovered\r\nmany canisters of crackers which were not unlike dog biscuit, and they\r\nrightly guessed that these were food for the monkeys. There were also\r\nseveral kegs of grain for some birds which hung suspended in a row of\r\ncages, and for the parrots.\r\n\r\n“I suppose those live rabbits must be for the snakes,” said Jack. “You\r\nknow, such reptiles won’t eat anything dead.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know that I want to feed any snakes rabbits,” said\r\nRandy, making a wry face.\r\n\r\nThey had soon fed the birds and the monkeys. Then, as there seemed no\r\nhelp for it, they slaughtered one of the sheep and threw portions of\r\nthe carcass to the various wild animals.\r\n\r\n“I hate the job,” was the way Jack expressed himself. “But I can’t\r\nleave those beasts to starve to death. They probably suffer as much\r\nfrom hunger as we did.”\r\n\r\nThe boys had opened several of the portholes of the lower deck, so that\r\nthe breeze, coming in, made the air below much sweeter. Yet it was not\r\na pleasant place to be in, and they were glad when the last of the\r\nanimals and the birds had been taken care of.\r\n\r\n“Now we’d better get down in the lower hold and see what condition the\r\nship is in,” declared Jack. “According to Small, we should have done\r\nthat in the first place.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” answered Randy. “Just the same, I’m glad we took care of those\r\nanimals and birds. That awful growling and moaning and chattering got\r\non my nerves.”\r\n\r\nLooking around once more to see that all of the things which were alive\r\nbelow decks had been properly cared for, the three lads advanced to the\r\nrunway down which they had come from the deck above. They were just\r\nabout to start up the runway when Randy uttered a scream of horror.\r\n\r\n“Look out, there!” he called. “Look out, or he’ll be after you!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” came simultaneously from the other Rover boys.\r\n\r\n“A snake! One of those big snakes!” was the reply. “He’s at the top of\r\nthe runway! There he goes out on deck!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                          FRED’S LUCKY THROW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three Rovers were alarmed, and with good reason. Such a snake at\r\nliberty on the deck of the water-logged steam yacht would be a constant\r\nsource of danger.\r\n\r\n“Are you positive you saw him, Randy?” questioned Jack.\r\n\r\n“Positive!” was the ready reply. “Gee, but he was a big one, too!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’d better warn the others,” broke in Fred. “That snake may go\r\nright after Andy or Small if they happen to be down on the deck.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going out, snake or no snake!” came from the young major.\r\n\r\n“Wait! Let’s get those hatchets and axes we saw back there,” cried\r\nFred, and ran back, to return a minute later with two axes and a\r\nfair-sized hatchet.\r\n\r\nCarrying these weapons ready for use, the three Rover boys mounted the\r\nrunway cautiously. At first they saw nothing on the deck. Then Fred\r\npointed excitedly to the wreckage at the bow.\r\n\r\n“There he is!” he cried. “There he goes under those boards!”\r\n\r\n“What are you yelling about?” came from Andy. He and the lanky sailor\r\nwere still resting on the top of the cabin.\r\n\r\n“It’s a big snake,” answered Jack. “He got loose and just came up a\r\nrunway. There are a whole lot of them down below, in a big wire cage.”\r\n\r\n“If we only had guns we could take a shot at that snake!” exclaimed\r\nRandy. “I’m sure we could soon blow him to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to take a shot of another kind!” exclaimed Fred, and, aiming\r\nas carefully as he could, he threw the hatchet with all the force he\r\ncould command.\r\n\r\nIt was a light and sharp affair, and as the bright steel circled\r\nthrough the air the boys saw the snake twist around and for a moment\r\nits head came into view. Then the circling hatchet descended, cutting\r\nthe snake deeply in the center of its body.\r\n\r\n“You struck him, Fred!” exclaimed Randy, in delight.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but he isn’t dead,” announced Jack, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Look out! He may come for you!” came from Andy, who could see the\r\nreptile from where he was resting. And now in his excitement he stood\r\nup, and Ira Small did likewise.\r\n\r\nThe wound made by Fred’s hatchet was evidently a severe one, and,\r\nmaddened with pain, the reptile whipped around and around on the\r\nforward deck. Then, of a sudden, it began to slide down the slope, and\r\na moment later disappeared over the side of the yacht into the heaving\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone!” murmured Randy, in awe-struck tones.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and I’m glad of it,” answered Jack. “Fred, that was certainly a\r\ndandy throw.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say it was a lucky one,” answered the youngest Rover boy\r\nmodestly. His face had blanched and he was breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n“For all we know, there may be more loose snakes around,” remarked\r\nJack. “We’ll have to be on our guard every minute.”\r\n\r\n“I move we look around the cabin for guns and pistols,” said Randy.\r\n“I’d feel a good deal better if I had some sort of firearm. It would\r\nbe a protection, not only against the snakes, but against those wild\r\nbeasts, if any of them should break loose.”\r\n\r\n“If I had my way, I’d heave all the beasts and the snakes overboard,”\r\ncame from Fred.\r\n\r\nHe armed himself again with the hatchet, and then the three boys\r\nrejoined Andy and the lanky sailor, and the five held a consultation.\r\n\r\n“The steam yacht don’t seem to be settlin’ very fast,” said Ira Small.\r\n“So I don’t know but what your idee of lookin’ round for some weapons\r\nain’t a first-class one. I’d like to have some kind of a shootin’ iron\r\nmyself. A bullet travels a heap-sight quicker nor a club, or a hatchet,\r\neither. Not but what that crack of yours, lad, wasn’t a wonder,” he\r\nadded hastily to Fred.\r\n\r\nWithout delay Jack and his two cousins re-entered the cabin and made\r\na thorough search of that compartment and the staterooms adjoining.\r\nThey kept their eyes open for more reptiles, but none appeared. In one\r\nstateroom they found a case containing two automatic pistols, and on a\r\nrack in another stateroom they found two double-barreled shotguns. All\r\nof the weapons were loaded; and they also found some extra ammunition.\r\n\r\n“Now I guess we’ll feel better,” said Jack, after Fred and Randy had\r\nappropriated the pistols and he had armed himself with one of the guns.\r\n“I’ll take this other gun up to Andy and Small.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s another pistol!” exclaimed Fred, having looked into a drawer\r\nunder one of the stateroom beds. “It’s a small affair, but it looks to\r\nbe all right and it’s fully loaded.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll give that to Andy and that old sailor can take the shotgun. Then\r\neach of us will have a weapon.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the staterooms they had also found a good-sized flashlight,\r\nand this Jack placed in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we really ought to go down in the lower hold and find out\r\nhow badly she is leaking,” he said. “Do you feel like going with me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel very much like it, Jack,” answered Fred, candidly. “But I\r\nsuppose it ought to be done. We’ll take our weapons and the flashlight,\r\nand then maybe we’ll be safe. I don’t believe any wild beast would want\r\nto charge us with that light flashing into his face.”\r\n\r\nThe boys soon located the engine room of the steam yacht, and there\r\nfound a ladder leading down to the lower hold, which was, as they later\r\non found, connected with the upper deck by several hatchways, all of\r\nwhich had been battened down during the storm.\r\n\r\nThey found the hold divided into several compartments. Most of the\r\ndoors of these compartments were closed and bolted. There was a\r\nmiscellaneous cargo of boxes, crates and barrels, all thrown into\r\nhopeless confusion, caused by the listing of the vessel.\r\n\r\n“She has not only settled on her port side, but she’s also settled at\r\nthe stern,” said Jack. “That’s why the smashed-in bow is sticking so\r\nhigh in the air. There doesn’t seem to be any great amount of water\r\nforward, not over a foot at the deepest.”\r\n\r\nWith caution the boys climbed to the stern of the steam yacht, and\r\nthere found the water in one place to be two and a half feet deep.\r\nThey looked at it carefully and threw the searchlight on all sides,\r\nbut could not bring themselves to believe that the water was becoming\r\nperceptibly higher.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what I think?” said Jack, at last. “I think the only\r\nopening is at the bow, and the only water that’s coming in now is what\r\nwe’re shipping from the rolling of the waves.”\r\n\r\n“Then what makes the vessel sink at the stern?” questioned Fred. “Why\r\ndidn’t she sink at the bow and go down?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t answer that question, Fred. Maybe they shifted some of the\r\ncargo in an endeavor to get the hole up above the water line. Anyway,\r\nthat’s how the thing is now, and I believe if we could get that hole\r\nclosed in some way, she’d float for a long time. I’m going to ask\r\nSmall about it; he knows more about ships than we do.”\r\n\r\nThe boys reported to Andy and the lanky sailor. Ira Small was greatly\r\ninterested, and said it was quite possible that the only hole might be\r\nat the bow.\r\n\r\n“Of course, the shock may have started a few of the seams below the\r\nwater line,” he said. “But mebby that water comin’ in could be taken\r\ncare of by the engine, or even the hand pumps. Anyway, it don’t look\r\nto me like she’d go down in a hurry. But I think we ought to try and\r\nclose that there hole in the bow. It didn’t look to be more’n four or\r\nfive feet an’ we kin easy cover that with a couple o’ tarpaulins, tyin’\r\n’em fast inside as well as out. You boys jest help me around a bit, an’\r\nI’ll show you how it kin be done.”\r\n\r\nThe next couple of hours were busy ones for all on board the\r\nwater-logged steam yacht. Even though his ankle hurt him considerably,\r\nAndy insisted on helping drag forward some heavy tarpaulins which\r\nwere found stowed away on the vessel. When it came to adjusting the\r\nnecessary ropes, Ira Small performed his share of the task. And so\r\nbetween all of them, two tarpaulins, one on top of the other, were\r\nlashed fast over the smashed-open bow of the vessel. Then Ira Small\r\ninsisted upon going down in the forward hold to show the boys how the\r\ninner tarpaulin could be fastened so that little or no water could\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n“Course it’s only a makeshift,” explained the lanky sailor. “But I’ve\r\nknowed sech a makeshift to last a long while. Now if we kin shift some\r\no’ that cargo, mebby we kin git her on more or less of an even keel.”\r\n\r\n“What about the water?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we won’t touch that at present, lad. Let it stay in the stern.\r\nIt’ll keep the bow up high, and that’s jest what we want. We’ll shut\r\nthe door to the stern hold, so the water won’t run for’ard if the yacht\r\nbegins to pitch.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the work was accomplished, and Jack, Fred and Randy had\r\nprepared supper, it was growing dark. All of those aboard the steam\r\nyacht were exhausted from their exertions and glad to rest and take\r\ntheir time at eating.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to do any more to-night,” said Fred. “I think the best\r\nwe can do is to shut ourselves in the cabin and make ourselves as\r\ncomfortable as possible in the staterooms.”\r\n\r\n“Just what I was going to suggest,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t we take turns at staying on guard?” suggested Andy. “I’m\r\nwilling to keep awake for two or three hours, and then, one after\r\nanother, you fellows can be called to do the same.”\r\n\r\nThereupon it was decided that each person should spend two hours on\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n“If it’s all the same to you boys, I’ll take the first watch,” said Ira\r\nSmall. “I want to see if I can’t do somethin’ with the steerin’ gear\r\naboard this yacht. If the rudder’s in workin’ order, I want to see if I\r\ncan’t head her up to the waves so she’ll ride a bit easier.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s all right; but don’t overtax your hurt leg,” answered\r\nJack. “If you need any of us in a hurry, yell or fire off the gun.”\r\n\r\nLighting the lantern in the cabin, the boys opened the doors to the\r\nvarious staterooms and then proceeded to make themselves as comfortable\r\nas the disordered condition of the compartments permitted. They had\r\nfound quite a quantity of clothing on board, and now proceeded to take\r\na rub-down and don some dry garments.\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful how warm it is,” said Jack. “I didn’t feel a bit cold\r\neven with that wet stuff on.”\r\n\r\n“We must have drifted southward,” returned Randy.\r\n\r\nThe lads were all too tired to do much talking, and having once gotten\r\ninto some other underwear, they hung their own garments up to dry.\r\nThen, one after another, they lay down to get what rest they could.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a couple of hours Jack aroused himself, and, as his\r\ncousins were all sleeping soundly, he went outside to see how matters\r\nwere going with the old sailor. He was just moving forward on the deck\r\nwhen he saw a dark shadow slinking along in the starlight.\r\n\r\nThe discovery filled him with alarm, and he stood stock still. Then the\r\nshadow took shape, and in another moment he saw that the object was a\r\ntiger!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                       AN ENCOUNTER WITH A TIGER\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the moment Jack’s heart seemed to stop beating. The tiger looked\r\nto be young but powerful, and had evidently broken from his cage in a\r\nsearch for food. He was sniffing his way along the deck, pausing every\r\nsecond or two to gaze around suspiciously.\r\n\r\nThe young major had one of the pistols with him, and he wondered if\r\nthat weapon would be powerful enough to slay the beast. He knew that a\r\ntiger is usually hunted with a heavy rifle.\r\n\r\nThe beast continued to slink along in the semi-darkness, and now Jack\r\nsaw that he was headed for the pilot house, where Ira Small sat nodding\r\nover the wheel. Evidently the beast had scented the sailor and was\r\nwondering if he could bring down his prey. Having had only a small\r\nportion of food, Jack fancied the tiger might take a desperate chance\r\nin an endeavor to satisfy the cravings of his stomach.\r\n\r\n“Hi, there, Small!” he yelled at the top of his lungs. “Look out for\r\nyourself!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” stammered the lanky sailor, straightening up suddenly\r\nand turning back from the wheel.\r\n\r\n“A tiger! Look out for him! Have you got your shotgun?”\r\n\r\nAs Jack uttered the words the beast turned, and without waiting further\r\nthe young major fired two shots in rapid succession. One took the tiger\r\nin the hind quarter and the other just grazed his neck. The beast gave\r\na wild leap and then whirled around to locate the unexpected attack.\r\n\r\nJack did not hesitate to retreat, and with all possible speed. Dashing\r\nup the sloping deck of the yacht, he gained the rail and there balanced\r\nhimself against a boat davit. The tiger saw him and crept forward a few\r\nyards, crouching low as if meditating an attack.\r\n\r\nBang! It was the report of Small’s shotgun, and the charge hit the deck\r\ndirectly behind the tiger, some of the shot entering his tail and his\r\nhind feet. With a wild roar the beast whirled around, and in excitement\r\nslid along the deck.\r\n\r\nAs he slid along the deck Jack fired again, this time hitting the beast\r\nsquarely in the side. Again came a roar and a savage snarl, the tiger\r\nbaring his glistening teeth as if willing to chew his attackers to\r\nbits.\r\n\r\n“Is he hit?” came from Small, hobbling forward.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but he isn’t dead,” answered Jack. “Give him the other barrel.”\r\n\r\nAgain the shotgun blazed forth, and this time the charge entered the\r\ntiger’s neck and forequarter. He straightened up, and then, seeing Jack\r\non the rail, made a savage leap in that direction.\r\n\r\nAs the beast came on, the young major fired once more. It was at close\r\nrange, and the bullet found its way directly into the open mouth of\r\nthe tiger. The spring came to a sudden halt and the beast dropped limp\r\nhalf over the rail and within three feet of where the young major\r\nwas standing. Then the tiger gave a convulsive shudder, dropped to\r\nthe deck, and slid down the slope against the broken-off end of the\r\nmainmast.\r\n\r\n“Is he dead?” questioned Small, coming from the pilot house gingerly.\r\n\r\n“I think so, but I’m not sure,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“What’s all the shooting about?” called another voice, and Randy\r\nappeared, followed by Fred, the first carrying a shotgun and the other\r\na pistol.\r\n\r\n“One of the tigers broke loose and we’ve been shooting at him,”\r\nanswered Jack. “There he is――over by the mast.”\r\n\r\n“A tiger!” exclaimed Randy. He grabbed the shotgun tighter. “Is he\r\ndead, or shall I give him another shot?”\r\n\r\n“I think he’s done for,” answered Jack. And when they turned the\r\nsearchlight on the beast, they saw that he had breathed his last.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is certainly the dog’s suspenders,” murmured Fred. “Are\r\nthere any more of those beasts loose?” he went on nervously.\r\n\r\n“You know as much about it as I do,” answered the young major. “I\r\nsuppose the others can get loose just as well as this one did. This is\r\ncertainly a fine wreck to be on!” he added, with a grim smile.\r\n\r\nBy this time Andy was hobbling up on deck. All of the crowd, including\r\nthe lanky sailor, surveyed the tiger carefully, but with great respect.\r\n\r\n“He certainly was a beauty,” remarked Jack. “And see what a peculiar\r\ncolor.”\r\n\r\n“I think the animals are all very fine,” answered Randy. “Perhaps this\r\nisn’t an ordinary menagerie ship. Maybe the people in charge were only\r\npicking up unusual specimens.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do――heave that beast overboard?” asked Andy.\r\n\r\n“No sense in doing that,” answered Jack, quickly. “We slaughtered one\r\nof the sheep to feed the other beasts; now I guess we can skin this\r\nand cut up the carcass for more food; and maybe we can even try a tiger\r\nsteak――that is, if we can get the stove to working,” he went on.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that all of the crowd were rather nervous for the\r\nremainder of the night. While one was at the wheel trying to steer the\r\nwater-logged yacht, another remained on guard at the entrance to the\r\ncabin, so that no wild beast might gain admittance.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned the first work of the boys and the old sailor was to\r\nmake sure that the other animals and the snakes were well secured. Then\r\nthe beasts, reptiles and birds were fed, after which, leaving Andy in\r\ncharge of the wheel and on the lookout for a possible sail, the others\r\nwent below, to make an effort to shift some of the cargo so that the\r\nwater-logged steam yacht might ride on more of an even keel.\r\n\r\nBut they soon found this task almost impossible. The fire was out under\r\nthe boilers, so that the engine of the yacht could not be started, and\r\nconsequently they could not use any of the hoisting machinery.\r\n\r\n“And we can’t do much with that cargo by hand,” declared Jack. “We’d\r\nonly break our backs and maybe get our fingers smashed. It would take a\r\ngang of heavy laborers several days to make an impression down here.”\r\nSo the task of shifting the cargo was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThey looked over the store of provisions and brought up a number of\r\nboxes and crates which contained things they thought they might use.\r\n\r\n“With the yacht so terribly listed, it’s out of the question to start\r\na fire under the boilers and get things to running,” declared Jack.\r\n“Everything is so out of kilter we might end by blowing the yacht up.\r\nI guess about the only thing we can do is to drift along and wait for\r\nsomebody to pick us up.”\r\n\r\n“If there was only some sort of radio on board!” sighed Randy.\r\n\r\n“There is a receiving set in the yacht’s office,” answered Fred. “But\r\nit doesn’t seem to be in workable condition. Probably it was knocked\r\nout of kilter in the collision.”\r\n\r\nThat day the boys managed to get the fire started in the cook’s galley,\r\nand for the first time in a number of days all enjoyed a cooked meal.\r\nIf a few of the articles of food were underdone or a bit burned, nobody\r\ncomplained. They took their time over the repast, and ate as they had\r\nnever eaten before.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, not a sail of any kind had appeared in sight.\r\nAnd even a trail of smoke that might indicate a distant steamer was\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\n“I reckon we’re out o’ the track o’ most ships,” was the way Ira Small\r\nexpressed himself.\r\n\r\n“If we only had the means to send out a radio call for assistance, it\r\nmight be worth while to try to get our latitude and longitude,” said\r\nJack. “But that’s of no consequence while we have no radio and no means\r\nof sailing the steam yacht in any direction.”\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the boys made another inspection of the\r\nwater-logged steam yacht, which was named the _Coryanda_. From records\r\non board they learned that the craft was owned by two scientists, Paul\r\nand James Ellingham, of Baltimore. The Ellinghams, it seemed, were much\r\ninterested in the collecting of rare beasts, birds and snakes, and the\r\nspecimens on the steam yacht had been picked up in various parts of the\r\nglobe after a tour lasting over two years. Each animal, reptile and\r\nbird was carefully catalogued.\r\n\r\n“Some valuable cargo, I’ll say,” declared Randy. “Just look here! A\r\nwhite and red parrot put down as worth two hundred dollars! I wouldn’t\r\ngive ten dollars for the best parrot going.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and look here! One blue-headed snake with a mile-long name put\r\ndown at two hundred and seventy-five dollars!” cried Fred. “I wouldn’t\r\ngive that much for a boatload of ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they’re probably worth that, and more, to some zoo,” declared\r\nJack. “Just the same, I’d rather not have such things on the _Coryanda_\r\nwhile I’m aboard.”\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore away slowly, and toward night Ira Small announced\r\nthat another storm was approaching.\r\n\r\n“An’ it’s comin’ up fast, too,” he declared.\r\n\r\n“What do you think it will do to us, Small?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“There’s no tellin’, lad,” answered the lanky sailor. “But when a ship\r\nis as water-logged as this here _Coryanda_ is, she’s liable to do most\r\nanything. The best we kin do is to fix up that raft of ours as good as\r\nwe possibly kin and git together all the provisions and water we kin\r\ncarry. Then, if the worst comes to the worst, we kin leave the yacht.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                            THE DOOMED SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Ira Small had predicted, the storm came up rapidly, and by sundown\r\nthe sky was heavily overcast and the wind was blowing freely. Then\r\ncame a shower of rain, the wind sweeping it furiously into the faces\r\nof those on the yacht as they moved around, trying to get together\r\nwhatever they thought might be of benefit if they had to take again to\r\nthe wreckage.\r\n\r\nJack, Randy and the old sailor had worked on the wreckage for over an\r\nhour, lashing the timbers together with half a dozen ropes and building\r\na small platform in the center so that they might rest more comfortably\r\nthan they had before.\r\n\r\n“If only we would strike land!” sighed Andy, who, like Small, was now\r\nlimping around despite the fact that his ankle was still swollen.\r\n\r\nBy midnight the storm was on them in all its fury. The _Coryanda_\r\npitched and tossed in the darkness, the wreckage at her side banging\r\nand pounding at every rise and fall of the waves.\r\n\r\n“Gee, maybe that raft will knock a hole in our side!” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know what to do about it, and neither does Small,”\r\nanswered Jack. “We can’t afford to cut it loose, and it might be too\r\ndangerous to try to tow it; the line might snap, and then we’d have\r\nnothing to take to if the yacht went down.”\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad if we all go down,” murmured Ira Small, mournfully. “I\r\nalways did hope I’d live long enough to find them thirteen rocks an’\r\ngit a chance to hunt for that pirates’ gold.”\r\n\r\nThe wind had been rising steadily until now it was blowing with\r\nhurricane proportions. The boys and the old tar did what they could\r\nto steer the yacht so that she might head up to the waves. But the\r\nwater-logged condition of the craft was against her, and often they hit\r\na mountain of water with a resounding crash that threatened to smash\r\nall the timbers beneath them.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how the vessel can stand much more of this,” declared\r\nRandy, after a crash that had all but sent them sprawling.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to take what comes, and that is all there is to it,”\r\nanswered Jack, trying to put on a brave front for the benefit of his\r\ncousins. “If she starts to go down, all we can do is to make a rush for\r\nthe raft.”\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock in the morning they made the discovery that the\r\n_Coryanda_ was slowly but surely settling. The force of the elements\r\nhad torn away one corner of the two tarpaulins lashed over the hole at\r\nthe bow, and into this the waves kept pouring whenever they hit.\r\n\r\n“Can’t we stop that hole?” asked Fred.\r\n\r\n“No, no, lad! Don’t try it!” warned the old sailor. “You’d be swept off\r\nby a wave before you knew what hit you. Stay where you are, and when\r\nshe gits too low I’ll let you know and we kin take to the raft.”\r\n\r\nAnother half hour passed, and then without warning came a resounding\r\ncrash on the keel of the _Coryanda_. The vessel seemed to slide along\r\non something and then slid off again into deep water.\r\n\r\n“Gracious! what was that?” gasped Andy, in new alarm.\r\n\r\n“We struck a key, I think,” answered Ira Small. “An’ if so, we must be\r\nsomewhere near land. You know, the West Indies are full of keys of all\r\nkinds.”\r\n\r\nThey had the ship’s lanterns lit, and now tried to pierce the darkness\r\nahead with the searchlight. But this hand instrument was too feeble to\r\nshow them anything. Then came another crash from underneath the steam\r\nyacht, and there followed a wild roaring, screaming and chattering\r\nfrom the wild beasts and parrots below decks.\r\n\r\n“Sounds as if something had broken loose down there!” exclaimed Fred.\r\n“Gee, if they come up here, we sure will be in a pickle!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how they can break out on deck with all those doors and\r\nhatchways shut tight,” answered Jack. Everything had been closed with\r\ncare to keep out the elements. Only the door to the cabin was open, so\r\nthat they might enter from time to time to shelter themselves from the\r\nfury of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nOne crash now succeeded another on the bottom of the steam yacht as\r\nthe vessel was driven furiously forward by the force of the wind. The\r\nroaring, screaming and chattering below continued, showing that the\r\nwild beasts and birds were in great terror and doing their best to gain\r\ntheir liberty.\r\n\r\n“We’re certainly among some keys,” said the lanky sailor. “But of\r\ncourse, lads, you got to remember they may not be above water. There’s\r\nthousands of places down in the West Indies where the keys are all\r\nbeneath the surface of the ocean. If we―――― Gosh! that’s the time we\r\nstruck a big one!”\r\n\r\nThere had been a tremendous crash, followed almost immediately by a\r\nbump, and then another bump. The _Coryanda_ was thrown so far over\r\nthat every one on board lost his balance and went sliding down almost\r\ninto the water. Then the doomed ship veered around in the wind, and,\r\ncarried by a mighty wave, swept forward to crash again and again in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“I reckon she’s goin’ to pieces!” cried out Ira Small. “We’d better try\r\nfor the raft if we kin make it. Be careful, everybody, or somebody’ll\r\ngit drowned!”\r\n\r\nAs well as they could in the darkness, the boys, led by Jack, crept\r\ndown to the rail where the raft was lashed fast. They were just going\r\noverboard when there came another mighty crash that threw every one of\r\nthem off his balance.\r\n\r\nSome struck the rail, but Randy and Fred were hurled clear into the\r\nboiling sea. Randy went down several feet, and so did his cousin.\r\nBlindly each of them struck out and soon reappeared on the top of a\r\nwave.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Fred?” spluttered Randy, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Where are the others? Did they go overboard?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Come on――let’s try to get on the raft.”\r\n\r\nBoth raft and yacht were but a short distance away, the lights of the\r\nlatter showed dimly through the flying mist of the storm. Bravely the\r\ntwo Rover boys endeavored to reach the raft. But before they could move\r\nmore than a dozen feet the storm carried both boat and raft out of\r\ntheir sight in the darkness.\r\n\r\n“They’re gone!” gasped Fred. “The ship and the raft are gone!”\r\n\r\nThe thought filled the two boys with agony, and yet instinctively they\r\nkept swimming, hoping almost against hope that something would come to\r\nsave them. All around were the mountainous waves, but presently they\r\nmade out a line of foam which proved to them that some sort of shore\r\nmust be close at hand.\r\n\r\n“See the foam, Fred!” gasped his cousin. “Come on――let’s make for it!”\r\n\r\nIt was a struggle that neither of the lads ever forgot. Time and again\r\nthey reached shallow water only to be sucked back by the receding waves.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think――I――can――make it!” gasped Fred. “Oh, the――storm is\r\nsomething――awful!”\r\n\r\nRandy was equally exhausted, and almost as hopeless. Yet almost\r\ninstinctively the two lads continued to struggle, and presently an\r\nextra high wave hurled them forward until their feet touched a sandy\r\nshore. Then, before the water could recede, they struggled onward\r\ndesperately, and at last reached a spot where the waves could no\r\nlonger touch them. Then they sank down, completely exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the others on the doomed steam yacht had managed to\r\nget down on the raft. They carried their firearms and an ax and a\r\nhatchet with them, and now Ira Small ordered that the hawsers which\r\nheld the raft to the yacht be cut.\r\n\r\n“But where are Fred and Randy?” questioned Jack, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“They went into the water. They must be somewhere around here,”\r\nanswered Andy. “Hold up the light so they can see it.”\r\n\r\nThe raft was now freed from the steam yacht, but the force of the wind\r\nstill kept the two together. Then the yacht struck again, and the force\r\nof the collision tipped the raft up so that those aboard were nearly\r\nspilled off into the sea.\r\n\r\n“Randy! Fred! Where are you?” yelled Andy. The possibility of his twin\r\nbrother and his cousin being drowned filled him with agony.\r\n\r\n“Look out, there! Something is comin’ down from the deck!” yelled Ira\r\nSmall, suddenly. “Lay low! Them beasts is gettin’ loose!”\r\n\r\nThey could see but little, for the force of the shocks had put out\r\nnearly every light aboard the yacht and on the raft. But they could\r\nhear a continual roaring and snarling, and now some of these sounds\r\nseemed to come closer. Then, of a sudden, tawny bodies loomed up near\r\nthe yacht’s rail.\r\n\r\n“It’s a lion! Two of them!” yelled Jack.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they’re getting ready to jump down here!” answered Andy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                            ASHORE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looked as if Andy was right, for both lions now had their forepaws\r\non the rail of the ship as if ready to leap down on the improvised raft\r\nand its occupants.\r\n\r\nBut just at that moment the keel of the _Coryanda_ struck bottom once\r\nmore, and an instant later the water-logged yacht swung around and\r\naway from the raft. The lions were left at the rail, and they roared\r\nsavagely in their combined perplexity and disappointment. Evidently\r\nthey knew not what should be their next move.\r\n\r\nBut those on the raft could give the beasts no further consideration.\r\nThe force of the hurricane sent the bit of wreckage whirling around and\r\naround and how the sea foamed and boiled on every side of the raft.\r\n\r\n“Hold tight!” yelled Jack to the others. “Hold tight!”\r\n\r\nAndy heeded the command. But Ira Small, who was moving forward and for\r\nan instant had let go of one of the ropes, slipped to the edge and\r\nbefore he recovered had disappeared in a shower of flying spray.\r\n\r\n“Small is gone!” muttered Andy, hoarsely. It was all he could do to\r\nkeep himself on the wreckage.\r\n\r\nJack did not answer. He, too, had seen the mishap to the lanky sailor\r\nand he realized that in such a tempest it would be next to impossible\r\nfor Small to save himself. He grabbed hold of the loose end of one of\r\nthe ropes and, tying this fast under his arms, passed the flashlight to\r\nhis cousin.\r\n\r\n“Keep this on me if you can,” he said, and leaped overboard.\r\n\r\nIt was a heroic move to make, for the young major knew that he was\r\ntaking his life in his hands. As the light shot through the flying\r\nspray, he caught a glimpse of the hands of the sailor a few yards away.\r\n\r\n“Help! Help!” yelled Small. “Throw me a rope!”\r\n\r\n“Keep up! I’m coming!” yelled Jack in return.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant Ira Small disappeared beneath a mountainous wave\r\nthat rolled over both him and Jack and threatened to engulf the raft.\r\nIt was more by luck than anything else that Jack reached the lanky\r\nsailor even before both of them came up to the top of the wave. Ira\r\nSmall was beating the water feebly.\r\n\r\n“I――I――got a――a cramp, or somethin’,” he spluttered. “It’s in――my legs.\r\nSave me, lad, save me!”\r\n\r\n“Hold tight, and we’ll get back to the raft!” panted Jack. “I’ve got a\r\nrope under my arms. Can you hold yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I――guess so, although that cramp is something terrible!” gasped the\r\npoor sailor, and Jack saw his mouth twist in agony.\r\n\r\nAnother wave came along at that instant, bringing with it the raft,\r\nto which Andy clung with one hand while spraying around the rays of\r\nthe flashlight with the other. The light struck the pair in the water\r\nfor just a moment, and then the fury of the hurricane sent the raft\r\nforward with a jerk that was keenly felt by Jack. Then the rope parted,\r\nand the young major found himself helpless in the boiling and foaming\r\nwaters with a bit of the rope dangling under him and Ira Small clinging\r\ndesperately to his back.\r\n\r\n“Kin you make it, lad? Kin you make it?” spluttered the old tar.\r\n\r\n“No. The rope broke,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“Then we’re bound for Davy Jones’ Locker!” moaned Ira Small. “Can’t\r\nyou save us somehow, lad? Kin you save us somehow? Remember them\r\nthirteen rocks an’ the pirates’ gold. Save me, an’ you kin have all\r\nthat gold.” And now the old sailor acted as if he were losing his mind.\r\nHe could swim but little, and the thought of being cast away in the\r\nocean and in the darkness terrorized him.\r\n\r\nBut if Small was ready to give up, Jack was not. Weighted down as he\r\nwas by his clothing and the rope which he could not unfasten just\r\nthen, and also by the form of the sailor, he continued to struggle\r\ndesperately in an effort to keep afloat. Ship and improvised raft had\r\nboth disappeared in the darkness, and he could see only a few feet in\r\nany direction.\r\n\r\nHe battled bravely, and wave after wave lifted the young major and his\r\nhelpless burden up and through that boiling and foaming sea, which\r\ndenoted that land was close at hand. Then he, like Randy and Fred, felt\r\nthe sand beneath his feet and took fresh courage.\r\n\r\n“We’ve struck land!” he cried. “Hold tight for a minute longer, Small,\r\nand I think we’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\nAnother wave swept forward, carrying the pair well up the beach. Then,\r\nwatching his chance, Jack, with Ira Small still clinging to him,\r\nstruggled madly to gain some sort of foothold on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Andy, left alone on the raft, did not know what to do.\r\nHe used the searchlight as best he could, and when the rope suddenly\r\nparted he retained presence of mind enough to throw a life-preserver\r\nwhich was on the raft in the direction his cousin had taken. Then the\r\nwaves and the flying spray cut out the view on all sides of him, and\r\nthough he wiped off the glass of the searchlight and played the rays in\r\nall directions, he could see nothing but the rolling ocean.\r\n\r\n“They are gone! All of them are gone!” he murmured, in agony. “First\r\nGif and Spouter and Ralph, and now all the others! I’m all alone!”\r\n\r\nThe poor boy was in such a state of mind that he was almost ready to\r\ncast himself into the sea and end it all. He was trying to think of\r\nwhat to do when, without warning, the raft was caught up by the waves\r\nand a few seconds later was grounded on the beach. It went back into\r\nthe wallow of the sea, but the next wave carried it still higher.\r\n\r\n“Ashore! Ashore!” cried Andy, in amazement. And then, before the raft\r\ncould again slide back into the ocean, he took a flying leap forward,\r\nlanding in water less than a foot deep and hobbled rapidly to a point\r\nof safety. As he did this, the raft was sucked back into the ocean and\r\nit disappeared from view into the gloom of the night and the storm.\r\n\r\nAndy had no thought of looking around to see upon what sort of place\r\nhe had landed. His one thought was of his cousins and the old sailor.\r\nHe still held the flashlight in his hand, and now as rapidly as he\r\ncould do so, he hobbled along the sandy beach, throwing the rays of the\r\nflashlight before him and calling loudly.\r\n\r\nThe first persons he encountered were Jack and the sailor. The young\r\nmajor sat on the sands panting for breath while beside him in a\r\nsemi-conscious condition lay Ira Small.\r\n\r\n“Jack!” was the eager cry. “Are you all right?”\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Andy?” panted the young major. “Yes, I’m all right. But\r\nSmall is pretty close to being all in. When the rope parted I thought\r\nsure we’d be drowned.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the others?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nLeaving the old sailor resting where he was, Jack and Andy continued\r\nthe search along the sands. They used the searchlight, and presently\r\nheard a cry from a distance, and Fred and Randy appeared.\r\n\r\n“Safe! Safe!” cried Andy, joyously. “Oh, how glad I am! I thought I was\r\ngoing to be all alone!”\r\n\r\nIt was a happy reunion, and for the moment the Rover boys did nothing\r\nbut hug each other in their delight at being together again. They cared\r\nnot if the raft and the steam yacht were gone, so long as all of them\r\nwere safe. They walked to the spot where Ira Small lay, and each sank\r\ndown to rest.\r\n\r\n“He’s certainly in bad shape,” said Jack, gazing at the old tar, who,\r\nwith closed eyes, was breathing heavily. “He said he had a cramp, or\r\nsomething like that.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what place this is?” put in Randy. “Maybe there’s some sort\r\nof village or town not far away. If so, we might be able to get a\r\ndoctor for him. Now that we have all been saved from the ocean, we\r\ncertainly don’t want him to pass away like this.”\r\n\r\nAfter having rested for some time, it was decided among the boys that\r\nthe twins should remain with the old tar while Jack and Fred set out on\r\na tour of exploration, taking the flashlight to guide their way.\r\n\r\nThe rain had stopped entirely, but the wind blew as fiercely as ever,\r\nand the boys had no easy time of it to make their way along the sandy\r\nshore. Back of the sand they found a dense mass of bushes and trees, a\r\nveritable semi-tropical jungle.\r\n\r\n“Gee! this doesn’t look as if there was any village or town very near,”\r\nobserved Fred, after they had passed up and down the somewhat narrow\r\nbeach for a goodly distance. “Do you suppose we’re on the mainland or\r\non an island, Jack?”\r\n\r\n“I’m of the opinion we’re on an island, Fred. It seems to me we were\r\ndrifting southward most of the time.”\r\n\r\n“Would we do that if the boat was in the Gulf Stream?”\r\n\r\n“I think we were east of the Gulf Stream. Anyway, I’ve got a hunch\r\nthat we’re somewhere in the West Indies, although, of course, I may be\r\nmistaken. I’m really and truly all at sea,” and Jack grinned grimly.\r\n\r\nThe two Rover boys walked along the beach until they came to a point\r\nwhere a huge wall of rock jutted out into the ocean, and here the\r\nflying spray stopped their further progress. Then they walked back\r\nalong the beach to where they had left the twins and the sailor, and\r\nthen continued their observations in the other direction. Here they\r\nfound that the beach made a turn, and the ocean came into what formed\r\na small bay. But at the entrance to this the jungle was so dense that\r\nprogress on foot was completely cut off.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any path around here, that’s certain,” remarked Jack, at\r\nlast. “Do you know what I begin to believe?” he added.\r\n\r\n“What?” questioned his cousin.\r\n\r\n“I believe we are cast away on a small deserted island.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                       ABOUT A PIRATES’ TREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning found the five castaways resting as comfortably as they could\r\nin the jungle on the edge of the sandy beach. The storm had passed\r\ncompletely, and only a mild wind had succeeded the hurricane. But the\r\nwaves were still angry and foamed and boiled as they struck the keys\r\nbeyond the beach.\r\n\r\nUtterly exhausted, one after another of the Rover boys had dropped to\r\nsleep. The last to lie down had been Jack. The young major had found\r\nsome rain water in a hollow between the trees and bushes, and had given\r\nIra Small a drink. The old sailor was still suffering, but none of the\r\nboys knew what more they could do for him, except to place him upon as\r\ncomfortable a couch as the edge of the jungle provided.\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry looking crowd that came together for a consultation\r\nshortly after the sun arose. The boys were still wet to the skin, but\r\nas it was comparatively warm, they did not mind this a great deal. They\r\nhung up their jackets and took off their shoes and socks and thus\r\nproceeded to dry themselves as best they could.\r\n\r\n“It certainly does look lonely around here,” remarked Fred, after\r\ntaking an observation in every direction. “Not a settlement nor a craft\r\nof any kind in sight!”\r\n\r\n“It looks like a deserted island to me,” remarked Jack. “Or, otherwise,\r\nit’s an unusually lonely bit of coast.”\r\n\r\nNow that they had rested, all felt the pangs of hunger. Water was to be\r\nhad in sufficient quantities for drinking purposes, but the jungle, as\r\nfar as they could see, afforded nothing in the way of food.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, that hurricane ought to have thrown some fish up on the beach,\r\nand maybe we can find some oysters,” suggested Randy.\r\n\r\n“Why not take a look around for the raft?” came from his twin brother.\r\n“It got stuck for a moment when I came ashore, and I can’t believe but\r\nwhat the hurricane cast it up somewhere around here.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave me!” groaned the lanky sailor, propping himself up on one\r\nof his arms. “Don’t leave me all alone in this out-of-the-way place.”\r\n\r\n“We’re not going to leave you, Small,” answered Jack, kindly. “We’ll do\r\nwhat we can for you, never fear.”\r\n\r\n“You saved my life, lad,” went on the old tar, gratefully. “I ain’t\r\nnever goin’ to forgit it, neither. You know what I said about them\r\nthirteen rocks and the pirates’ gold. If I ever lay hands on that gold,\r\nyou’re goin’ to git a big share of it.”\r\n\r\n“What I’d like to lay my hands on just now is a roast-beef sandwich,”\r\nsaid Andy. “I feel hollow right down to my toes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a sandwich and a good cup of hot coffee,” put in Fred.\r\n\r\nAs Andy’s foot still hurt him, it was decided that he was to remain\r\nwith the sailor while the three other boys walked down the beach in the\r\ndirection where Andy had landed.\r\n\r\nFor a long while the searchers found nothing of interest outside of\r\nseveral small fish they discovered flapping around in a pool well up on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n“There are a couple of meals, anyhow,” said Jack. “That is, if we can\r\nmake a fire to cook them over.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ll make a fire all right enough. I’ve seen it done several\r\ntimes, when the party didn’t have any matches,” declared Fred. “Of\r\ncourse, it isn’t very easy.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what we can do,” suggested Randy. “If there are any\r\nbirds around we might bring them down either with the firearms or with\r\nbows and arrows.”\r\n\r\nThe three Rover boys continued their explorations until almost noon,\r\nand then, to their satisfaction, caught sight of the raft being slowly\r\npounded to pieces on a series of keys just outside the tiny bay\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\n“There she is!” exclaimed Jack, who was the one to make the discovery.\r\n\r\nThe improvised raft still hung together, and so far as they could see\r\ntheir stores were still upon it. But the sea was pounding it heavily,\r\nsending the spray completely over it.\r\n\r\n“Maybe if we had a line heavy enough we could haul the raft ashore,”\r\nsuggested Randy.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken when the force of the waves made the raft break\r\nloose from the keys upon which it was stuck, and an instant later it\r\nsurged shoreward.\r\n\r\n“It’s coming in!” cried Fred. “Let’s see if we can’t haul it up somehow\r\nor other.”\r\n\r\nThe next fifteen minutes were filled with strenuous exertions on the\r\npart of the three Rover boys. Twice the wreckage came up on the sand,\r\nand they did their best to hold it, but without success. Then they\r\nmanaged to get hold of two of the ropes which lashed the wreckage\r\ntogether, and, watching their opportunity, they waited for an extra\r\nhigh wave and then ran the wreckage up the beach as far as they\r\npossibly could.\r\n\r\n“Now come on and tie it fast!” yelled Jack.\r\n\r\nHe had found a loose end of one of the ropes. Tying this to another\r\nrope they had found on the wreckage, they ran up the beach and anchored\r\nthe improvised raft fast to a palm tree.\r\n\r\n“Now let’s get the stuff ashore before the raft has a chance to break\r\nloose,” directed the young major.\r\n\r\nWorking with feverish haste, the three boys pitched boxes and crates\r\nand canned goods out on the sand above the reach of the ocean. It was\r\nwell that they did this, for before they had finished their task the\r\nwreckage began to go to pieces. The continual pounding of the elements\r\nhad snapped a number of the ropes, and now one bit of timber after\r\nanother drifted away.\r\n\r\n“Come on! Let us take the wreckage up as high as we can get it!”\r\ndirected Jack. “That stuff may come in useful as firewood, if for\r\nnothing else.” And so what was left of the raft was presently hauled to\r\na place of safety.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the boys long to look over the stores, and, carrying\r\nwhat they needed, they hurried back to where they had left Andy and the\r\nlanky sailor.\r\n\r\nThey had matches in a water-tight box, and soon a fire was lighted and\r\na meal started, much to every one’s satisfaction. After the meal Ira\r\nSmall felt better. He was not yet able to get on his feet, stating that\r\nhis legs felt too shaky; but he insisted upon sitting up and taking\r\npart in the discussion of what should be their next move.\r\n\r\n“I reckon we’re on a little island of the West Indies,” said the old\r\ntar. “There’s dozens an’ dozens of ’em scattered fur hundreds o’ miles\r\naround. Most of the islands have settlements, but there’s a lot of ’em\r\nthat ain’t visited once a year. The folks down here can’t grow nothin’\r\non ’em, an’ couldn’t git the stuff to market if they did, an’ so the\r\nislands are left to themselves, not bein’ near where ships usually\r\ntravel.”\r\n\r\n“Was it on one of these islands that your thirteen rocks and the\r\npirates’ gold was located?” questioned Randy, curiously.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, lad. An’ if I ever git my hands on that gold, you lads are\r\ngoin’ to have a fair share of it. I ain’t never goin’ to forgit how\r\nJack, here, saved my life.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us something about the pirates’ gold, will you?” questioned Fred.\r\nThe search and the work of the morning had tired him completely, and he\r\nwas content to rest for a while after eating.\r\n\r\n“To go into the details would be a long yarn, lad――longer nor any of\r\nyou would care to listen to,” answered Ira Small. “Howsomever, here is\r\nthe gist of it:\r\n\r\n“About five year ago I fell in with two old sailors who hailed from\r\nJamaica. They was talkin’ about the thirteen rocks and pirates’ gold,\r\nand one of ’em had several snap-shot photygraphs of them thirteen\r\nrocks and where they was located on an island. They said the place\r\nwasn’t so very far from Porto Rico, an’ they tried to figure out how\r\nto locate that island, which they had once visited. The thirteen rocks\r\nwas located in something of a circle, an’ in the center of it was a\r\nflat rock, an’ under that the treasure of gold hidden by Zalopa, an old\r\nSouth American pirate, and his men.”\r\n\r\n“Gee, I’d like to locate that pirates’ treasure!” murmured Fred, his\r\neyes glistening. “What do you suppose it’s worth?”\r\n\r\n“Them old sailors thought it was worth a big amount, although how much\r\nthey couldn’t exactly say,” answered Ira Small.\r\n\r\n“Where are the sailors now?” questioned Jack.\r\n\r\n“Both dead. They got smallpox, an’ nobody would nurse ’em but me. I\r\nstayed with ’em till they died, an’ they was so grateful they said\r\nI could have the treasure if I could find it. They told me all they\r\ncould about it. After their death I got smallpox myself, but it didn’t\r\namount to a great deal. I reckon I was too thin an’ leathery,” answered\r\nthe lanky sailor solemnly.\r\n\r\n“And you’ve never had a chance to look for the treasure?” questioned\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\n“Not much of a chance. You see, after I had the smallpox I had to earn\r\nmy livin’ an’ I didn’t have no time to go treasure huntin’. But some\r\nday, if I can git anybody int’rested, I’m goin’ to git a ship an’ sail\r\naroun’ lookin’ fur an island with them thirteen rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Did you save the pictures?” asked Andy.\r\n\r\n“I got two of ’em. The rest got tore up an’ lost. The two are sewed up\r\nin a pocket o’ my shirt. Some day I’ll show ’em to you,” answered the\r\nold tar.\r\n\r\nIt was fascinating to speculate upon a pirates’ treasure, but just at\r\npresent the boys felt that they must turn their attention to conditions\r\nas they now existed.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to try to climb up one of those tall palm trees and take a\r\nlook around,” announced Jack, a little later. “I’ve seen pictures of\r\nhow the natives go up those trees, and I’m going to try the stunt.”\r\n\r\nHe took a stout rope, and, going to one of the trees, proceeded to\r\npass the rope around his body under the arms and then around the tree,\r\nleaving a slack of about two feet. Then, barefooted as he was, he\r\nstarted to ascend the palm tree by grasping the bark with his toes and\r\nsliding the rope up from one point to another, bearing back on the rope\r\nfrom time to time to keep it from slipping.\r\n\r\nJack had read about this method of ascending a tree, and had even seen\r\na moving picture of a native climbing in this fashion. It had looked\r\neasy enough in the picture, but he soon realized that ascending in this\r\nfashion was anything but easy. However, he was determined to get up,\r\nand after a prolonged effort managed to reach a point where he could\r\nlook around for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\n“What do you see?” called out Randy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see much of anything,” was Jack’s answer. “We’re on an island.\r\nThere isn’t any settlement, and not a ship of any kind is in sight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                           A TIME OF ANXIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nJack’s announcement filled all of those below with keen disappointment.\r\nThey had hoped from his position in the tall palm that he would\r\ndiscover either that they were on a point of the mainland or that some\r\nsort of settlement was not far away.\r\n\r\n“Gee, we’re regular Robinson Crusoes!” declared Andy, with a sigh.\r\n“What do you know about that!”\r\n\r\n“And not a sail in sight!” murmured Fred.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and nothing in the way of a boat to get away on,” added Randy.\r\n\r\n“I thought it might be that way,” put in the old sailor. “We sure are\r\nin a pickle, an’ no mistake. But it’s a mighty good thing you sighted\r\nthe raft an’ got them stores ashore. That food will last us quite\r\na spell.” And then he added suddenly: “Don’t he see nothin’ of the\r\n_Coryanda_?”\r\n\r\n“What about the steam yacht?” called up Fred.\r\n\r\n“Nowhere in sight,” was Jack’s answer, after another look around.\r\n\r\n“Then she must have gone to the bottom,” came solemnly from the lanky\r\nsailor. “I thought she was doomed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s one satisfaction,” was Andy’s comment. “If she went\r\ndown, it’s good-bye to all those savage beasts and those horrible\r\nsnakes.”\r\n\r\nAfter a careful survey of the surroundings, Jack came down from the\r\ntree and told the others the details of what he had seen.\r\n\r\n“The island looks to be about a mile long and not quite half a mile\r\nwide,” he said. “The western end is mostly rocky and extends out into\r\nthe ocean for a considerable distance. Looks to me as if it might be\r\nof volcanic origin, like we have studied about in school. Over to the\r\neastern end of the island is that little bay, and there the jungle is\r\nvery dense. There are more rocks at the far eastern end of the island,\r\nsome quite tall.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t see anything at all in the way of a settlement or a\r\nplace where boats might land?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“Not a thing! It looks to me as if this island had never been visited.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I reckon these islands are all visited once in a while,” remarked\r\nIra Small. “The natives come in their long boats to see what they can\r\npick up. But we might have to wait a good many months before any one\r\nwould come here to take us off.”\r\n\r\n“And it doesn’t look as if we could build a boat ourselves――not with\r\nthe material we have,” answered Jack, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Then it looks as if we might be booked to stay here quite a while,”\r\nremarked Randy. “Oh, dear, I wonder what the folks at home will think!”\r\nhe went on soberly.\r\n\r\n“They’ll think we have all been lost at sea,” answered Fred.\r\n\r\n“They will unless those aboard the _Hildegarde_ tell how we escaped in\r\nthe motor boat.”\r\n\r\n“Those rascals won’t open their mouths about that,” answered Andy. “And\r\neven if they did,” he went on, “they’d most likely think the motor boat\r\nwas lost in the hurricane.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think became of Ralph, Gif and Spouter?” remarked\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\nNo one cared to reply to this. All wished to hope for the best, yet\r\ndown in their hearts they were satisfied that their school chums had\r\ngone to a watery grave. A sudden spell of melancholy fastened itself\r\nupon the four Rover boys. The mind of each traveled back to the loved\r\nones at home, and they could well visualize the agony of mind which\r\ntheir parents and the girls must endure.\r\n\r\n“More than likely mother is half crazy, and so are dad and Martha,”\r\nmused Jack to himself. “Oh, if only we had a radio sending station, or\r\nsome carrier pigeons, or some means of communicating with them!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the folks at home will start some sort of a search for us,”\r\nsaid Fred, a little later. “But it will be a good deal like looking for\r\na pin in a haystack.”\r\n\r\n“We can only hope for the best, Fred,” said Randy. “Gee, I wish we\r\ncould do something! I don’t want to stay on this forsaken island for\r\nany great length of time!”\r\n\r\n“None of us wants to stay here,” declared Andy. “We haven’t any great\r\nstock of provisions, and what are we going to do when those are gone?\r\nOf course, we can catch fish, and maybe get some oysters, and perhaps\r\nbring down a few birds. But who wants to live on that sort of stuff\r\nvery long?”\r\n\r\n“There may be something we can find to eat in the jungle,” said Jack.\r\n“Bananas or cocoanuts or mangoes, or some other semi-tropical stuff\r\nlike that. It isn’t likely there’s very much on a place that’s so\r\nrocky.”\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the boys explored the island further, penetrating\r\ninto the jungle for quite a distance. Here, however, they found the\r\nthickets so dense that progress was almost impossible.\r\n\r\n“We’d have to cut our way along to get to the south side of the\r\nisland,” declared Jack. “A fellow could never get through unless he\r\nfound some sort of a trail.”\r\n\r\nThey did manage to reach the shore of the little bay. Here the water\r\nwas comparatively quiet, and here they came upon some of the wreckage\r\nthat had torn itself loose from the improvised raft.\r\n\r\n“We can make a little raft of that stuff and sail around the bay on\r\nit,” said Jack. “But I don’t see what good it will do.”\r\n\r\nToo tired at last to do anything else, the boys returned to their\r\ntemporary camp and there proceeded to fix an evening meal and prepare\r\nthemselves for a second night on the island. They had secured a\r\ngood-sized tarpaulin from the wreckage, and, cutting some poles with a\r\nhatchet, they soon had a tent erected. Then all the boys set to work\r\nto cut down some small branches, with which they fixed up beds for\r\nthemselves and for the old sailor.\r\n\r\nFortunately, they had recovered all the firearms left on the improvised\r\nraft, and none that had been carried in their pockets had been lost, so\r\nthat now all were armed as before.\r\n\r\n“But we must remember that our supply of ammunition is limited,” said\r\nJack. “So don’t shoot at anything unless you have to.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what there is to shoot at,” answered Randy, who was frying\r\none of the fish brought back from the pool.\r\n\r\n“Well, something may turn up when you least expect it,” answered the\r\nyoung major.\r\n\r\nTheir clothing was now dry, yet they presented anything but an enviable\r\nappearance. Their linen was much soiled and torn and their suits were\r\nalso torn and very much mussed up.\r\n\r\n“We wouldn’t do to go to a party, would we, Jack?” remarked Fred, when\r\nthey were preparing to retire. “I wonder what Ruth Stevenson would say\r\nif she saw you now.”\r\n\r\n“Probably she’d be glad to see me and all the rest of you, Fred,” was\r\nthe prompt answer. “I know I’d be mighty glad to see her and all of the\r\nothers. Wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Would I! Would a duck swim or a monkey eat peanuts? I’d give all I’m\r\nworth to be safe and sound again at home or at Colby Hall. Gosh! it\r\nseems as if we had been away for ages.”\r\n\r\nNothing that night disturbed the party, and all were stirring early,\r\neach wondering what they might do to get out of their predicament. To\r\nstay on the lonely little island indefinitely was unthinkable. Besides,\r\nthey felt they must let their parents know of their whereabouts at the\r\nearliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nWhen Andy was dressing, Jack noticed that Andy was surveying his\r\ninjured ankle quite seriously. The fun-loving Rover boy had lost much\r\nof his light-heartedness.\r\n\r\n“Does it still hurt, Andy?” he questioned kindly.\r\n\r\n“A little, Jack. But I don’t mind that so much,” was the sober reply.\r\n“It’s when I try to walk. It doesn’t seem to act like it used to.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“It’s stiff. I can’t bend it, and it makes me walk sort of flat-footed.\r\nHaven’t you noticed it?”\r\n\r\n“I thought you limped a little.”\r\n\r\n“It’s worse than that. I don’t know what to make of it. But I certainly\r\ndon’t want to walk with a limp all the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t think of such a thing!” exclaimed Jack, in dismay. His\r\ncousin had always been so acrobatic that to think of his being lame\r\nfilled the young major with dismay.\r\n\r\n“If I could only see a doctor or get to a hospital, maybe they could do\r\nsomething for it before it got too bad,” went on Andy. “I guess I need\r\nattention as much as Small does.”\r\n\r\nAs the boys did not wish to carry the pile of wood brought in from\r\nthe breaking up of the improvised raft, they shifted the camp a little\r\ncloser to where the wood lay, and there put up the tent in more\r\npermanent fashion, digging a trench around the back and both sides, so\r\nthat in case of rain the water would run off into the sand. They also\r\nfixed some better bedding, and from some stones built a small fireplace\r\nwhere they might cook their meals to better advantage.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the afternoon when Randy, who had been\r\nwalking up the beach in the direction of the high rocks, came running\r\nback in great excitement.\r\n\r\n“Do you see it? Do you see it?” he called out eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Do we see what?” asked several of the others in chorus.\r\n\r\n“A ship! There she is! And I believe she’s coming to this island!”\r\n\r\nAll gazed in the direction to which Randy pointed, and far out at sea\r\nthey saw what seemed to be a bark with all sails set.\r\n\r\n“She’s either coming this way or else she’s going to round the eastern\r\nend of the island,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“Let’s do what we can to signal her!” exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\nThe boys had already talked over the matter of signals, and now they\r\nstarted up the fire and then heaped upon it some damp brushwood,\r\nthereby causing a dense smoke. Then two of them went down the beach,\r\nwaving a bit of sailcloth while the other two went up the beach and did\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nWould their signals be seen? Anxiously the boys waited to find out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                             IN THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFive, ten, fifteen minutes went by slowly. The wind had fallen\r\nsomewhat, so the progress of the vessel in the distance was slow.\r\n\r\n“She’s coming this way, I’m sure of it!” declared Randy.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be too certain. You may be disappointed,” answered Fred.\r\n\r\nThe youngest Rover boy had scarcely spoken when the bark seemed to veer\r\noff to the eastward.\r\n\r\n“She’s going away!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe she’s only tacking in the wind.”\r\n\r\nWith strained eyes the boys watched the vessel in the distance. Now she\r\nseemed to tack back, much to their delight.\r\n\r\n“She’s coming in!”\r\n\r\n“They must be seeing our signals!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! I wonder what sort of a vessel she is?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she’s another rum-runner,” came from Fred.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Fred, don’t say that!” exclaimed Andy.\r\n\r\n“Well, you can’t tell, Andy. We must be right in the path of that kind\r\nof a ship. So many of them run from the West Indies to the United\r\nStates.”\r\n\r\n“Look, look!” cried Jack, in sudden dismay. “She is turning away again.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. She is steering due east!” added Randy, with something\r\nlike a groan.\r\n\r\nAnother five minutes passed, and then all of the boys, as well as the\r\nlanky sailor, came to the conclusion that the bark was moving eastward.\r\nFrantically the lads continued their signaling, and saw to it that the\r\nclouds of smoke from their fire continued. But if the signals were\r\nseen, no one paid any attention to them, and presently the bark, far\r\nto the eastward, was but a speck in the distance on the bosom of the\r\nrolling ocean.\r\n\r\n“She’s gone! They didn’t even notice us!” exclaimed Fred, and his voice\r\nhad something of tears in it.\r\n\r\nAll were downcast, and it was some time before they could get back to a\r\nmore optimistic frame of mind.\r\n\r\n“They should have seen the smoke, even if they couldn’t see us waving\r\nthe sailcloth,” said Randy, bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Well, if they saw the smoke, they might have thought it was from a\r\nfire built by some of the natives,” answered Jack. “If I was sailing\r\namong a great bunch of islands like the West Indies, I wouldn’t want to\r\nstop to investigate every pillar of smoke I saw.”\r\n\r\n“If we only had a regular flag, then we could hoist it up in one of\r\nthe trees. If we placed it upside down, that would be sure to attract\r\nattention sooner or later.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but we haven’t a flag, so we’ve got to do without it,” said Andy,\r\nwho was now rubbing his hurt ankle in an endeavor to limber it up.\r\n\r\nAnother day passed, and by this time the boys felt a little more at\r\nhome on the island. A few hours of fishing had sufficed to bring in a\r\ngoodly mess, and while some of these were eaten, the others were placed\r\nin a pool where they might be drawn upon whenever necessary. The boys\r\nhad also made a hunt for oysters, and while they had found a few of\r\nthe bivalves, they were not of a particularly good variety, and no one\r\ncared for them except the old tar.\r\n\r\n“Some day I’m goin’ to make myself a good, big stew of ’em,” said Ira\r\nSmall. “I always did like a stew made of oysters caught on the spot.”\r\n\r\nNow that he could rest whenever he desired, the lanky sailor recovered\r\nrapidly, so that in a couple of days he was able to hobble around with\r\nthe aid of a cane which Jack cut for him. A great friendship had sprung\r\nup between the young major and the old tar.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t forgot how you saved me from goin’ down to Davy Jones’\r\nLocker,” the old sailor said more than once. “An’ don’t you forgit what\r\nI said about that pirates’ gold. If I lay hands on it, you git your\r\nfull share.”\r\n\r\nAfter a quiet Sunday on the island Jack and Randy made their way on\r\nMonday morning to the little bay and there constructed a raft out of\r\nthe wreckage that had drifted into the opening. Then, with their shoes\r\nslung around their necks and their socks in their pockets, they set\r\noff for the opposite shore of the bay, using two pieces of boards for\r\nsculls.\r\n\r\n“We may find nothing over there to interest us,” said Jack. “Just the\r\nsame, it won’t hurt to go over. Perhaps we can find some sort of a\r\ntrail to the south side of the island.”\r\n\r\nAs the water was calm, it did not take the boys long to reach the other\r\nside of the little bay. Here they found a spot where landing was easy\r\nand tied up the raft so that it might not float away. Then, putting on\r\ntheir socks and shoes again, they continued their explorations.\r\n\r\nThey soon found that progress in this direction was almost as difficult\r\nas it had been in the vicinity of their first camp. The jungle was a\r\nmass of tangled undergrowth and heavy vines, with here and there some\r\nfair-sized palm trees. A little further on they came to a series of\r\nrocks which seemed to bar their further progress in that direction.\r\n\r\n“We don’t seem to be getting anywhere, Jack,” remarked Randy, as he\r\nstopped to catch his breath and wipe the perspiration from his brow.\r\n“Gee! this doesn’t seem to be like December weather, does it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must remember we’re pretty well south,” was the young\r\nmajor’s answer. “What do you think we’d better do――go back?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s move along the base of the rocks. Maybe we’ll find some sort of\r\nan opening. I’d like very much to get to the south shore of the island,\r\njust to find out what is there.”\r\n\r\nOnce more they went on, advancing with care for fear of slipping and\r\nperhaps spraining an ankle. They had a hatchet with them, and often had\r\nto cut the brushwood and the vines, to make a passage for themselves.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing we want to remember,” said Jack, suddenly. “And\r\nthat is that we’ve got to get back. We don’t want to lose our way.”\r\n\r\n“I guess not!” exclaimed his cousin. “Why, if we lost our way in this\r\njungle we might never get out. We’d have to climb a tree or some of\r\nthose rocks just to locate ourselves.”\r\n\r\nPresently, in the midst of the jungle, they came to a small clearing.\r\nHere there was a rocky hollow, and they found a bubbling spring of\r\npure, cool water.\r\n\r\n“Say, this is worth while!” exclaimed Jack, after each of them had\r\ntaken a drink. “I wish we had this spring near the camp,” he added as\r\nthey sat down to rest and eat their lunch.\r\n\r\n“Look on the ground, will you!” exclaimed Randy, suddenly. “Look at\r\nthose footprints! What do you make of them, Jack?”\r\n\r\nBoth gazed at the soft ground in the vicinity of the spring, and there\r\nsaw a number of footprints evidently made by some wild animals.\r\n\r\n“What animals do you suppose they can be?” questioned Randy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. In fact, I don’t know what sort of wild animals exist on\r\nthese islands. They are certainly not the marks of horses or cows or\r\nsheep, or anything like that.”\r\n\r\n“If there are any wild animals in this jungle, we’d better be on our\r\nguard.”\r\n\r\n“I should say so! I wish we had brought one of the shotguns along.”\r\n\r\n“So do I.”\r\n\r\nThey had with them two of the pistols, but they realized that these\r\nweapons might prove of small use against any large beasts.\r\n\r\nThey looked around the vicinity of the spring, but nothing in the way\r\nof an animal showed itself. Not even a bird was in sight, and all was\r\nas quiet as the grave.\r\n\r\nWhat to do next, the two boys did not know. If there were wild animals\r\non the island, that might change matters very much, so far as they were\r\nconcerned. They would have to keep on guard continually, and might even\r\nhave to take some means of protecting themselves against attack.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose those beasts might be from the wreck of the _Coryanda_?”\r\nsaid Randy suddenly.\r\n\r\n“It’s possible. That wreck might have come close enough for some of\r\nthe animals to jump overboard and swim ashore. Or, the vessel may have\r\nstruck the island and then gone to pieces and drifted away before we\r\nhad a chance to see what happened.”\r\n\r\nThe boys discussed the situation and came to the conclusion that the\r\nbest thing they could do would be to return to the camp and inform the\r\nothers of what they had discovered.\r\n\r\n“If there are any wild animals loose here, every one of our crowd\r\nought to know it,” said Jack. “And the quicker we get the information\r\nto them the better.”\r\n\r\nHe and Randy turned back and made their way once more along the base\r\nof the rocks. It was now about two o’clock in the afternoon, and they\r\nhoped to return to camp well before dark, which, in that portion of the\r\nglobe, came on suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins had passed along less than fifty yards when suddenly\r\nJack held up his hand.\r\n\r\n“Look, Randy! Look!” he whispered.\r\n\r\nRandy did as directed, and there a short distance ahead saw on a flat\r\nrock the form of a big lion. The monarch of the jungle stood out\r\nboldly. He was looking off into the brushwood and acted as if he were\r\nwatching something.\r\n\r\n“It’s a lion!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! And as they don’t have lions down here in the West Indies, it\r\nmust be one of those from the _Coryanda_.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. What shall we do――fire at him?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it would do much good――at least not from such a\r\ndistance. If we got closer we might be able to wound him, even if we\r\ndidn’t kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I don’t want to get closer, with nothing but a pistol to\r\nshoot with.”\r\n\r\n“Neither do I. But what are we going to do? He’s right in the way of\r\nour getting back to the raft.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the boys saw the lion straighten up and get ready as if to\r\nmake a leap into the brushwood below. Then they were startled as they\r\nheard a rustling in the jungle, and the next moment a full-sized goat\r\nleaped into the clearing just ahead of them. The animal was evidently\r\nfull of fear, and knew not which way to turn.\r\n\r\n“A goat!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it’s one of those that were on board the steam yacht! Don’t\r\nyou remember her? The one with the black spots on her neck? The one\r\nAndy said he’d like to try to milk?”\r\n\r\nThe goat saw the boys and, as if asking protection, leaped toward them.\r\nThen from the lion on the rock came a roar, and the next instant the\r\nbig beast hurled himself into the brushwood in the direction of the\r\ngoat.\r\n\r\n“Gee, the goat is coming this way!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the lion is after her――or else he’s after us!”\r\n\r\nThe two boys held ready their pistols, and as they did so they\r\nretreated to the vicinity of the rocks. They were backing up to these\r\nwhen suddenly the goat leaped around, saw the lion, and immediately\r\nmade another leap and started to scramble up the rocks within several\r\nyards of where the boys were now crouching.\r\n\r\nThe lion came tearing forward, and then he too bounded up on the lower\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nBut hardly had he touched these when the goat made a mighty leap and\r\nwent up out of his reach.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I’m glad the goat got away,” muttered Randy.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken when the lion, evidently much disappointed,\r\nturned around on the rocks and the next instant caught sight of the two\r\nlads. Up went his mane and he let out a savage roar, and then hurled\r\nhimself in their direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                          THE THIRTEEN ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\n“He’s coming this way! Use your pistol, quick!”\r\n\r\nCrack! Crack! Both of the pistols spoke up, and the lion was hit in the\r\nhead and in the left foreleg. Then the two Rover boys fired again, this\r\ntime at even closer range, one bullet piercing the beast’s ear and the\r\nother plowing through the skin of his back.\r\n\r\nBut nothing stopped the rush of the ferocious lion, and it was only by\r\nleaping to the rear of the nearest rock that Jack and Randy escaped the\r\nonslaught.\r\n\r\nIn the next few minutes so many things happened that it is almost\r\nimpossible to describe them. The lion, with another roar and snarling\r\nfrom pain, came around the rocks just as the boys leaped up. Then,\r\nstanding several feet above the beast, they fired once more. The\r\nlion retreated, got wedged in between a tree and a rock, and turned\r\nsavagely, probably thinking in his excitement that he had in some way\r\nbeen attacked from the rear.\r\n\r\n“There’s a shelf just above us!” exclaimed Jack, glancing around for\r\nsome means of escape. “Let’s get up there!”\r\n\r\nRoar after roar came from the lion, the sound so terrifying it was\r\nenough to make anybody tremble. The goat was leaping from rock to rock,\r\nand now disappeared from sight. The shelf the young major mentioned\r\nwas a rocky one about three feet above their heads. Over it grew a few\r\nvines, and Randy clutched these only to have them come away in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Here, let me boost you up, Randy!” exclaimed Jack. “Quick! That lion\r\nmay take it into his head to leap at us!”\r\n\r\n“But what of you?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get up somehow! Hurry! We have no time to waste!”\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds Randy was boosted to the shelf. Looking around, he saw\r\na place where he could dig in with his toes, and he promptly lay flat,\r\nextending his hands downward as he did so.\r\n\r\n“Come on! I’ll help pull you up!” he gasped. “Hurry up! The lion is\r\ngetting ready to jump.”\r\n\r\nThus assisted, the young major managed to scale the wall and reach the\r\nrocky shelf. He had scarcely done so when the lion, crouching low,\r\nmade a wild leap upward.\r\n\r\nThe distance the beast covered was fully fifteen feet, and both the\r\nRover boys felt that he might have gained the rocky shelf had it not\r\nbeen for Randy’s quick action. Beside him lay a jagged stone half as\r\nbig as his head. This he scooped up and launched at the beast when the\r\nlion was less than a yard away. The stone did little damage to the lion\r\nphysically, but the attack was so unexpected that the forward movement\r\nof the king of the jungle was stopped, and he dropped down on the rocks\r\nfrom which he had come.\r\n\r\n“Fire at him, Jack!” called out Randy. “Give him every bullet you’ve\r\ngot!” And then both boys emptied their pistols into the beast as he\r\nstood there, evidently trying to make up his mind what next to do.\r\n\r\nSome of the shots went wild, but two hit the lion squarely in the side,\r\nand now with roars of pain and fear the beast suddenly retreated and\r\nthe next instant disappeared in the undergrowth on the edge of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe he’ll come back!”\r\n\r\n“Let’s reload just as fast as we can.”\r\n\r\nThe last suggestion was a good one, and they carried it out immediately.\r\nIn the meanwhile, they kept their eyes on the jungle, but the lion did\r\nnot show himself.\r\n\r\n“Maybe he’s mortally wounded,” suggested Randy.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” answered his cousin. “But we can’t take any chances on\r\nsuch a big beast as that. Gee! when he leaped for this shelf, I was\r\nscared. I thought he was about ready to eat us up.”\r\n\r\n“He’d have killed us both, Jack, if he could have gotten at us,”\r\nanswered Randy, with a shudder.\r\n\r\nThe boys realized that they had been in great danger, and if they were\r\nexceedingly nervous, who could blame them? With reloaded pistols, they\r\nwaited where they stood, straining their eyes and ears for any other\r\nmovement the lion might make.\r\n\r\n“And the worst of it is,” said Jack, “if that lion and that goat came\r\nashore from the _Coryanda_, for all we know, all the other beasts, and\r\nmaybe the snakes, came ashore too.”\r\n\r\n“They could only do that if the steam yacht was completely wrecked so\r\nthat the cages were broken open.”\r\n\r\n“Well, those cages didn’t look very secure to me. Don’t forget how\r\nthat snake and that tiger got loose.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to get back to camp somehow and warn the others. But I must\r\nconfess I don’t feel much like going through that jungle to where we\r\nleft the little raft.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I. I’d rather try to climb over the rocks and get to the bay,\r\nsomehow or other, that way.”\r\n\r\nThe boys made an investigation and presently found a place at the end\r\nof the narrow shelf where two or three rough steps led upward. Neither\r\nof them wished to trust himself in the jungle, and so they kept on for\r\nover half an hour, climbing one rocky height after another in their\r\nendeavor to reach the bay without taking to the heavy growth to the\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! I see the ocean!” cried Randy, presently. “I think if we keep\r\non in this direction we’ll soon get to a point where we can get down to\r\nthe bay. But, of course, we’ll be quite a distance from where we left\r\nthat raft.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. Maybe we can swim back to the raft,” answered Jack. He\r\nfelt that anything would be better than facing such wild beasts as\r\nmight now be roaming the otherwise deserted island.\r\n\r\nIt was hard work climbing over the rocks, which in many places were\r\nsharp and irregular.\r\n\r\n“Look out that you don’t go down into some deep hole,” warned Jack.\r\n“You might get wedged so tight you’d never get out.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that goat got along easily enough. A goat loves to leap the\r\nrocks.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we’re not goats. Come on! We want to get back before night.”\r\n\r\nThe boys moved forward, but the going was now more perilous than ever,\r\nand presently, having leaped to a spot that looked fairly easy to\r\nnegotiate, they found further progress all but impossible.\r\n\r\n“Looks like we were stuck, Randy,” said the young major, scratching his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say that, Jack! We don’t want to go back after coming all\r\nthis distance!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but if we can’t go ahead we’ll have to go back.”\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes the two youths searched around, and then managed to\r\nfind a split between two of the rocks and beyond this a rocky slope\r\nleading still farther upward.\r\n\r\n“We might as well try this,” said Randy. “If it doesn’t lead to\r\nanywhere we can go back.”\r\n\r\nThe rocky slope ended in something of a plateau. The boys were now\r\nat one of the highest points on the island and could see in almost\r\nall directions, the heavy jungle cutting off only a small part of the\r\ncoast line in the southwest. To the north and the east, as well as the\r\nsoutheast, rolled the mighty Atlantic, flashing in the rays of the\r\ndeclining sun. To the eastward on the island were innumerable rocks,\r\nsome of them fantastic in shape and forming a sort of bowl, the bottom\r\nof which was now shrouded in shadows.\r\n\r\n“My gracious! this whole end of the island is nothing but rocks,”\r\ndeclared Randy.\r\n\r\n“Look!” exclaimed Jack, pointing to the coast southward. “Unless I’m\r\ngreatly mistaken there is the wreck of the _Coryanda_!”\r\n\r\n“It’s the old steam yacht just as sure as you’re born!” answered his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n“No wonder I didn’t see the wreck from the top of that palm tree,” went\r\non the young major. “See how she’s wedged in between the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it looks to me as if her backbone was broken, Jack. Anyway,\r\nshe’s split bow and stern. No wonder the animals got loose. Smashing up\r\non the rocks that way must have loosened everything.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe most of the animals were killed by the shocks.”\r\n\r\n“I hope they were.”\r\n\r\nThe two boys walked to a nearby rock in an endeavor to get a better\r\nview of the wreck, which was all of a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\n“We’d have a hard job getting down to her, I’m thinking,” remarked\r\nJack. “I don’t believe we’d ever be able to get over those rocks. We’d\r\nhave either to sail around to the eastward, or otherwise make our way\r\nto the south shore and get to her from that point.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad we located her, Jack; aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure I am, Randy. If we have to stay on this island any great\r\nlength of time we’ll probably need everything we can get from the\r\nyacht. We didn’t have any great variety on the raft, remember, and we\r\nneed some clothing as well as food.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t forget that we want a flag to hoist upside down as a signal\r\nof distress.”\r\n\r\nHaving inspected the wreck as well as they could from such a distance,\r\nthe boys began speculating on how they might get down from the rocks\r\nto the eastern shore of the little bay. They had to go forward with\r\ncaution, because at every step the way seemed to become more perilous.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe any human being was ever on these rocks before,” was\r\nRandy’s comment.\r\n\r\n“I guess you’re right,” answered Jack. “What would bring a person\r\nup to such an out-of-the-way place, anyhow? There isn’t much to this\r\nisland, and I don’t wonder the natives give it the go-by.”\r\n\r\nThe boys went a few yards farther, and then both leaped to a rock that\r\nseemed to be secure, but which was not. Under their combined weight it\r\ntilted unexpectedly, and they suddenly found themselves sliding they\r\nknew not to where.\r\n\r\n“Grab hold!” yelled Jack, and did what he could to stop his progress,\r\nand Randy did likewise.\r\n\r\nDown they went over one slippery rock after another, bringing up at\r\nlast in a sort of pocket on the side of a cliff. Here they stood\r\npanting for breath and rubbing their shins and their elbows, which had\r\nbeen sadly scraped in the descent.\r\n\r\n“Great Cæsar! I thought we were going down to kingdom come,” gasped\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\n“Now we are in a pickle!” returned the young major. “How ever are we\r\ngoing to get out of this place?”\r\n\r\nJack began to look around, wondering what their next move might be. An\r\ninstant later he let out an exclamation of astonishment.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Jack?” queried his cousin, as he saw the young major\r\npointing his finger and counting slowly to himself.\r\n\r\n“Look there, Randy! Am I right, or am I only dreaming? Do you see these\r\nsharp-pointed rocks all around us? Well, just count them, will you?”\r\n\r\nCatching what was in Jack’s mind, Randy began to count the huge circle\r\nof sharp-pointed rocks.\r\n\r\n“Why, there are thirteen of them!” he burst out. “Oh, Jack! do you\r\nthink――――”\r\n\r\n“That this is the place Ira Small has been talking about? Well, it\r\ncertainly looks like it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                            THIEVES IN CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two boys gazed in awe at the circle of thirteen sharp-pointed rocks\r\nwhich arose majestically in a circle that was all of an eighth of a\r\nmile in diameter. There were other rocks on every side, but these stood\r\nout distinctly so that there was no mistaking them.\r\n\r\n“If these are the thirteen rocks Small has been talking about, then\r\nthat pirates’ treasure ought to be located in the center of this\r\ncircle,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“And that would be somewhere down there,” added Randy, pointing with\r\nhis finger to the rocks far below them. “Jack, do you really think\r\nthere is a treasure here?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Randy. It may be only a fairy tale. Why should any\r\npirates come to such a forsaken place as this to bury their treasure?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I was thinking. It would be much easier for them to\r\nbury their gold close to where their ship landed. They would have an\r\nawful job getting to such a spot as this.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there’s some secret way of getting from the shore to this\r\nplace――some trail over and between the rocks of which we know nothing.\r\nAnyway, the thirteen rocks are here.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we had seen those photographs the old sailor talked about. Then\r\nwe’d know in a minute whether this was really the place or not.”\r\n\r\nHad the rocks been less dangerous to climb, both of the boys would\r\nhave tried to descend to the center of the rocky bowl in a quest of\r\nthe pirates’ treasure. But they realized that it would be extremely\r\ndangerous to attempt to approach that place from where they stood,\r\nand so, rather regretfully, they turned their backs on the thirteen\r\nhigh-pointed rocks and continued their search for some means of\r\nreaching the little bay where they had left their raft.\r\n\r\n“Gee, this is certainly some island to be on,” was Randy’s comment, as\r\nthey moved forward slowly and cautiously, testing every foothold to\r\nmake certain that it was secure. “Wild animals and a pirates’ treasure!”\r\n\r\n“It would sound exciting to read about,” commented the young major.\r\n“Just the same, I’d like to be out of this mess, Randy.”\r\n\r\n“So would I. And just think of the folks at home! How they must be\r\nworried about us!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but there is something even worse than that. Think of Ralph, Gif\r\nand Spouter.”\r\n\r\n“I’m thinking about them every day, Jack. Life at Colby Hall won’t be\r\nthe same with Gif and Spouter gone. And Ralph certainly was a fine\r\nfellow.”\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark when the two Rover boys at last reached a point\r\nwhere getting down to the eastern shore of the bay was comparatively\r\neasy. By this time they were all but exhausted from their efforts, and\r\nboth resolved to break through a short bit of the jungle in an endeavor\r\nto reach the raft.\r\n\r\n“Keep your pistol ready for use, Randy,” warned the young major, and\r\nthen he moved forward with his firearm in one hand and the hatchet in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBoth boys were on edge, thinking that some wild animal might pounce out\r\nupon them at any instant. But nothing happened to disturb them, and a\r\nlittle later they reached the raft and, much relieved, sculled their\r\nway over to the other side of the bay, this time landing as close to\r\nthe ocean and its sandy shore as possible.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Hello!” came from out of the fast-gathering darkness, and a\r\nmoment later in reply to their answering calls Fred appeared.\r\n\r\n“I supposed you’d be getting anxious about us,” said Jack. “We\r\ncertainly have had plenty of things happen to-day. We’ll tell you all\r\nabout it when we get back to camp.”\r\n\r\nSeated comfortably in camp and partaking of a substantial meal gotten\r\nready by the other boys, Jack and Randy told first about the encounter\r\nwith the lion.\r\n\r\n“Gee, I hope you killed him!” cried Fred. “I don’t want to meet such a\r\nbeast as that around here.”\r\n\r\n“The lion must have come from the yacht,” put in Ira Small. “An’ if\r\nthat’s so, then the ship must have come ashore on the island.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what she did,” answered Randy. “We saw the wreck lying\r\nbetween the rocks away off to the southeast.”\r\n\r\n“Did you visit the ship?” questioned Andy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No. We were too far away, and climbing over those rough rocks is no\r\neasy task.”\r\n\r\n“And now we have something of more importance to tell,” said Jack.\r\n“That is, we hope it may prove of more importance. Small, I’d like\r\nto see those photographs of those thirteen rocks you’ve been talking\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Jumping toadstools, Jack! you don’t mean to say that you’ve spotted\r\nthose thirteen rocks?” ejaculated Andy, and for a moment he stood\r\nstraight up, forgetting all about his twisted ankle.\r\n\r\n“We certainly did see thirteen rocks; great big ones, too, and all in a\r\ncircle!” cried Randy, proudly. “Of course; they may not be the thirteen\r\nrocks Small has been talking about, but there were thirteen of them,\r\nand all in a circle, just as plain as the nose on your face!”\r\n\r\n“Hurray! I knowed them rocks was on an island somewhere around here!”\r\nburst out the lanky sailor. “I been figgerin’ it out in my mind ever\r\nsince we come ashore. Wait! Somebody give me a sharp pocketknife an’\r\nI’ll cut them photygraphs loose so you kin see ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe two photographs were soon brought forth from the shirt pocket into\r\nwhich they had been sewn; and by the aid of the searchlight Jack and\r\nRandy examined them carefully.\r\n\r\n“The same place!” exclaimed Randy. “Don’t you think so, Jack?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do!” was the ready reply. “Just look at that rock there\r\nand the one over here! Don’t you remember how this one had two points\r\nand that one had three?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and this one here was just a bit flatter than any of the others.\r\nOh, it’s the same place! I’m sure of it!”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it’s the same place, do you suppose the pirates’ gold is\r\nthere?” questioned Andy, quickly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” answered the young major. “The whole center\r\nof the circle seems to be formed like a huge bowl and is very rocky. We\r\nhad no means of getting down to the middle of it. As it was, we slipped\r\ntwo or three times and nearly broke our necks.”\r\n\r\n“The gold is there, I know it is!” came solemnly from Ira Small. “We’ll\r\nhave to go on a hunt for it first chance we git.”\r\n\r\n“Of course these pictures weren’t taken from anywhere near where we\r\nstood,” said Jack, after looking at the photographs a second time. “It\r\nlooks to me as if they’d been taken from the north. And if that’s so,\r\nthen there must be some way of getting down into the rocky bowl from\r\nthat direction.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no idee how they got to the place,” said the lanky sailor. “There\r\nmust be some kind of a path leadin’ from the shore. Mebby the pirates\r\ncast anchor outside of the keys an’ come ashore in small boats.”\r\n\r\nEagerly the four Rover boys and the old tar talked the matter over. For\r\nthe time being they forgot completely about the wreck of the _Coryanda_\r\nand the wild beasts and snakes which might have come ashore. Presently,\r\nhowever, Jack reminded them of the peril.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to keep all our weapons handy and somebody will have to\r\nremain on guard after this,” he said. “We don’t want a couple of lions\r\nor tigers surprising us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and we don’t want any big snakes crawling in to sleep with us,”\r\nput in Fred, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“Let’s keep the fire bright,” suggested Andy. “Wild beasts don’t like a\r\nblaze.”\r\n\r\n“If we could only get to the wreck of the steam yacht, perhaps we’d be\r\nable to find some rifles,” said Jack. “Then I’d feel almost like going\r\nafter those wild beasts. But I don’t care to do it with a shotgun or a\r\npistol.”\r\n\r\nThey talked the matter over still further, and in the end made up a\r\nregular schedule so that each of the boys, as well as the old sailor,\r\nwould take his turn at remaining on guard. Of course, the old tar could\r\nnot do much in the way of moving around, but his eyes and his ears were\r\nas alert as any one’s, and that was all that was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe night, however, passed without incident, and morning found Jack and\r\nRandy much rested; and with daylight the alarm over the wild beasts\r\nsubsided somewhat.\r\n\r\n“I wish we had some sort of a boat,” said Jack, while eating breakfast.\r\n“Then we could skirt the island and visit the _Coryanda_, and also look\r\nfor some sort of path leading to that circle of rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t we build a sort of scow out of the wreckage?” questioned\r\nFred. “We’ve got plenty of boards and ropes, and I think we could get\r\nquite a lot of nails out of the stuff if we set to work to do it.”\r\n\r\nAs nothing else suggested itself, the boys surveyed all the wreckage\r\nthey had brought ashore and finally concluded they might utilize a\r\nportion of it in building a sort of sharp-pointed scow. Then they set\r\nto work, Ira Small hobbling down the sandy shore to watch them.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task to build the scow, and it was not until noon of\r\nthe next day that the craft was ready for use. They had nailed it as\r\ntight as possible, but this was not saying much, and they relied mostly\r\non the solid flooring with which the scow was furnished to keep them\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\n“Now we’ll have to make some sort of sweeps for it and then we’ll be\r\nready to set sail,” declared Fred.\r\n\r\nAll had become so interested in making the scow seaworthy, that, for\r\nthe time being, the camp had been forgotten.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s about time somebody got grub ready,” murmured Andy,\r\npresently. “Scow or no scow, I want my dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you go on back and start things,” returned Jack. “Perhaps you’d\r\nbetter go with him, Fred. Randy and I can finish here. We’ll be along\r\nin a few minutes.”\r\n\r\nFred and Andy walked back in the direction of the camp with Ira Small\r\nhobbling after them. They had covered not more than half the distance\r\nwhen Andy gave a sudden cry.\r\n\r\n“Look what’s going on in camp!” he exclaimed. “What in the world are\r\nthose things, anyway?”\r\n\r\nFully two dozen small forms were moving rapidly in and around the camp.\r\nWhat was being done neither of the boys could surmise until suddenly\r\nFred let out a yell of dismay.\r\n\r\n“They’re monkeys! What do you know about that!”\r\n\r\n“They must be the monkeys from the wrecked yacht,” answered his cousin.\r\n“And look! Do you see what they’re doing? They’re carrying off our\r\nthings!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                         AT THE WALL OF ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nHad it not been such a serious situation, the two Rover boys would have\r\nbeen inclined to laugh at what was happening. But they realized that\r\nthe canned food and other things in the camp meant a great deal to\r\nthem, and they did not intend that the monkeys should make away with\r\nthe stuff.\r\n\r\n“Get out of there! Scoot! Scat!” yelled Fred, running forward.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by his cousin, and in a moment more both boys found\r\nthemselves in the midst of the simians. The monkeys chattered and\r\nsqueaked in alarm, but none of them seemed to be inclined to retreat.\r\nMany of them had found something to eat, and the others were snooping\r\naround, doing their best to tear open packages or break open some of\r\nthe canned goods.\r\n\r\n“Get out of here!” yelled Fred. He had scarcely spoken when one of the\r\nmonkeys dropped a can of beans on his toes and leaped upon the youth’s\r\nleft shoulder. “Hi! Get off of there!”\r\n\r\nBut instead of getting away, the monkey caught hold of Fred’s ear and\r\nheld tight, shrieking and chattering loudly as he did so.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile two other monkeys leaped upon Andy, one on his\r\nshoulder and the other on his back, holding tight to the alarmed\r\nboy’s collar. The other simians ran back and forth, chattering most\r\ninfernally. One had picked up a pan brought in from the wreckage, and\r\nthis he banged upon any object that came to hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MONKEY CAUGHT HOLD OF FRED’S EAR AND TWO OTHERS LEAPED\r\nUPON ANDY.]\r\n\r\n“For gracious’ sake! what’s that racket in camp?” exclaimed Jack,\r\nlooking up suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi! Come here! Some monkeys have attacked the two boys!” yelled\r\nIra Small at the top of his lungs. And then, somewhat scared at the\r\nunexpected turn of affairs, the lanky sailor blazed away with a shotgun\r\nhe was carrying.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the old tar was poor, and the shots scattered into the\r\njungle back of the camp. But the noise had its effect, and in a\r\ntwinkling all but two of the monkeys began to take their departure. But\r\nthey did not go empty handed. With loose food, canned stuff and other\r\nthings in their paws, they scrambled into the jungle, and, amid a wild\r\nchattering, disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Monkeys, of all things!” burst out Randy, rushing forward beside the\r\nyoung major. “Who ever thought they would come to attack us!”\r\n\r\n“They’re probably hungry, just the same as that lion was,” answered\r\nJack. “There they go!”\r\n\r\nThe two monkeys that remained were the ones that had clung fast to\r\nFred’s ear and one of those which had fastened itself to Andy’s collar.\r\nThese continued to chatter and squeak, but held fast as if seeking\r\ncompanionship and protection.\r\n\r\n“Gee, do you know what I think?” declared Andy, suddenly. “This little\r\nbeggar is tame. He isn’t half as wild as those others were.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the other monkey had let loose of Fred’s ear, and now sat\r\nperched on the lad’s hand, looking up into Fred’s face so comically\r\nthat the youth was compelled to grin.\r\n\r\n“If you’re going to be friendly, all right,” said the boy. “Just the\r\nsame, you had me pretty well scared.” And then he stroked the monkey,\r\nand the frisky little animal seemed well content to nestle in the crook\r\nof his arm.\r\n\r\n“I’ll wager that these two monkeys were pets of the people on board\r\nthe steam yacht,” declared Jack, when the momentary excitement had\r\ncome to an end and the party had made sure that all the other monkeys\r\nhad disappeared. “If it wasn’t so, these fellows wouldn’t stay here a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\n“I guess you’re right,” answered Fred. “Just the same, what are we\r\ngoing to do with the two little beggars? We don’t want to feed them,\r\nand I’m certain that I don’t want to kill them.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to feed them and then chase them back into the woods,”\r\nsuggested Andy.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have fine work chasin’ ’em away after you’ve fed ’em,” declared\r\nIra Small, coming as close to grinning as the boys had ever seen. “Feed\r\na monkey once, an’ you’ll have him around you forever. The only way to\r\ngit rid of ’em is to douse ’em with cold water.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if they want to stay, let them,” answered Jack. “They’ll help us\r\npass the time when we haven’t anything else to do.” The cuteness of the\r\ntwo little simians appealed to him, just as it did to all the other\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nA little later, after the monkeys had been fed to their hearts’ content,\r\nthe Rover boys tied them to nearby trees so that they might not get into\r\nfurther mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following morning that all started out in the\r\nclumsy scow, if such it might be called, to make the trip around the\r\neastern end of the island to where the wreck of the _Coryanda_ lay. On\r\nthe way they thought they might land once or twice on the sandy beach\r\nbelow the rocks in an endeavor to find some passageway leading to the\r\nspot where they thought the pirates’ gold might be hidden.\r\n\r\nAt first Jack and Randy had thought to take the trip, in company with\r\nIra Small; but Fred and Andy had protested so vigorously that it was\r\nfinally decided that all should go, even though the scow might be\r\nrather crowded.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy craft had been provided with four extra long sculls, or\r\nsweeps, and everybody, even to Andy, went barefooted, knowing that they\r\nmight be standing in several inches of water most of the time. They\r\ncarried their shoes in a water-tight canister, so that they might have\r\nthese foot coverings whenever they landed. They also carried with them\r\na supply of food, not knowing how long they would be away.\r\n\r\nIt was an ideal day for the trip. There was hardly any wind, and\r\nconsequently the surf at the keys and along the beach had greatly\r\nsubsided. They got afloat without much trouble, and then the old\r\nsailor took command, telling them how they might progress to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t no need to go out any further than jest to keep from bein’\r\nthrowed up on them rocks,” he said, after they had passed the entrance\r\nto the little bay. “An’ every one keep his eyes peeled for anything\r\nthat looks like an openin’.”\r\n\r\n“Were there any marks leading to the treasure――I mean anything in\r\nthe way of a signboard?” questioned Randy of the lanky sailor.\r\n\r\n“There was supposed to be a triangle,” answered Ira Small. “A triangle\r\nof three arrows. Them sailors said the triangle led to the circle.”\r\n\r\n“Then, having found the circle, we’ll have to keep our eyes open for\r\nthe triangle,” murmured the young major.\r\n\r\nSlowly and not without some danger, they finally rounded the eastern\r\npoint of the island. Although they had watched closely, no one had\r\ndiscovered any opening that might lead to the bowl of the thirteen\r\nrocks. Here and there they had discovered small bunches of brushwood\r\nand vines growing among the rocks, and had seen higher up innumerable\r\nnests of sea birds, but that was all.\r\n\r\n“But the opening must be there――that is if the yarn about the treasure\r\nis true,” declared Jack.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to make a more careful search when we’re coming back,” said\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the opening is behind some of those vines or bushes,” put in\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\nHaving rounded the eastern end of the island, it did not take them long\r\nto reach the vicinity of the spot where the _Coryanda_ had been cast\r\nup among the rocks. Here were innumerable little keys, and Ira Small\r\nrightfully guessed that it was only the force of the hurricane that\r\nhad driven the water-logged steam yacht in so far and with such dire\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n“She’s busted clean an’ clear,” was the lanky sailor’s comment.\r\n“Busted, lengthwise an’ sidewise. They won’t never be able to do a\r\nthing with her. She’s gone forever.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to go slow about going aboard,” said Jack. “No more wild\r\nbeasts for me!”\r\n\r\n“Or snakes, either,” added Fred.\r\n\r\nThey had brought along the shotguns and pistols, and had seen to it\r\nthat every weapon was fully loaded. Now, as they came up beside the\r\nrocks on which the _Coryanda_ rested, Jack told Fred and Andy to remain\r\nat the sweeps while he and Randy and the old sailor held their weapons\r\nready for use should the occasion require.\r\n\r\nBut all seemed calm and peaceful in the vicinity of the wreck, and,\r\ngaining courage, the whole party presently landed, made fast, and\r\nmounted to the deck of the old steam yacht at a point close to the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nA glance around showed them that everything was in the wildest\r\ndisorder. Evidently the water-logged yacht, driven by the hurricane,\r\nhad pounded on the rocks time and again before some extra large wave\r\nhad cast her up and broken her into practically four pieces, two\r\nforward and two aft. Hatchways and the runway for the animals were\r\nwide open, and in one spot they could look down an opening to the very\r\nkeel of the vessel.\r\n\r\n“Be careful how you move around,” warned Randy. “Otherwise, somebody\r\nmay slip through one of those openings and break his neck.”\r\n\r\nOn account of the condition of the steam yacht, and because there might\r\nstill be some of the wild beasts or snakes present, they moved around\r\nthe wreck with great caution. Thus an hour or more passed. They found a\r\nsheep and a little deer, both wedged in the wreckage and dead.\r\n\r\n“The animals and the snakes seem to be gone,” declared Jack, at last.\r\n“And all of the monkeys have gone, too, and also the parrots. About all\r\nthat are left are a few of the small birds, and I guess we might as\r\nwell give them their liberty.” And this was done.\r\n\r\nWhen the noon hour was reached all were tired and hungry and glad\r\nenough to sit down on the deck and eat a portion of the food they had\r\nbrought along. As they did this they talked over the situation.\r\n\r\n“There are plenty of stores here, and most of the stuff seems to be in\r\ngood condition,” remarked Jack. “So, no matter what else happens, we’re\r\nnot liable to starve to death.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we could stay on board if we wanted to?” suggested Fred.\r\n“It might be safer to sleep in the cabin here, even in its partly\r\nwrecked condition, than to bunk out on the beach with those wild\r\nanimals at large.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t want to stay all the time,” put in Randy. “We can’t\r\nstretch our legs here. Besides, it might be dangerous if another\r\nhurricane struck us. I saw some rifles on board, and if we arm\r\nourselves with those, I’d rather be back in the vicinity of the old\r\ncamp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, whatever the crowd want to do――――” began Jack, and then came to\r\na sudden stop. A distant humming had reached his ears, and this humming\r\nsteadily increased in volume.\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose that is?” questioned Andy, looking at Jack\r\ncuriously. He, too, had noticed the humming.\r\n\r\n“Sounds like an aeroplane motor,” was the quick reply. “Hear how loud\r\nit’s getting!”\r\n\r\n“There it is!” shouted Randy, pointing skyward. “It’s an aeroplane as\r\nsure as you’re born!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it’s heading this way!” cried Fred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                        A SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several seconds all those on the deck of the wrecked steam yacht\r\nwatched the on-coming flying machine with intense interest. Then Randy\r\nuttered a sudden exclamation.\r\n\r\n“The flag! Let’s put it out upside down for a distress signal!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and let’s make some smoke! We can do it with some wet papers,”\r\nput in Fred.\r\n\r\nWhile Fred and Andy got ready the smoke signal, Randy and the young\r\nmajor rushed to where they had found the flags belonging to the wrecked\r\nvessel. As quickly as possible they selected the biggest Old Glory on\r\nboard and brought it out on the deck.\r\n\r\n“How kin you raise it?” questioned Ira Small. “There ain’t no masts.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll tie it to a pole and hold it up from the top of the cabin,”\r\nanswered Jack, hurriedly.\r\n\r\nIn all haste the flag was fastened to a pole the boys had noticed some\r\ntime before and then raised to the top of the cabin, where Randy and\r\nJack waved it frantically at the on-coming ’plane. A few minutes later\r\nthe flying machine was almost directly overhead. It was of fair size\r\nand contained two occupants.\r\n\r\n“It’s a hydroplane!” exclaimed Fred. “See the pontoons under it?”\r\n\r\n“I hope she lands,” murmured Andy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe they can land on the ocean very well,” said Jack. “But\r\nthey might land in that bay on the north shore.”\r\n\r\nEagerly the whole party watched the movements of the hydroplane. It\r\nseemed to be passing them by when it slowly turned in a wide circle to\r\nthe eastward. Then it came along over the wreck once more.\r\n\r\n“They’re dropping something!” cried Jack. “Here it comes!”\r\n\r\nA white object about as big as a man’s head came dropping down from the\r\nhydroplane. It was evidently of light weight, for its descent was not\r\nrapid and the wind carried it from over the stern of the wreck to a\r\npoint just beyond the bow. Then the hydroplane sailed on.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet it’s a message of some sort!” burst out Randy, and he and\r\nFred scrambled over the side of the yacht and on to the rocks where\r\nthe object lay. They found it was made of paper, tied lightly with a\r\nstring, and to it was attached a bit of cardboard on which was written:\r\n\r\n    “Wreck and distress signals seen. Cannot land. Will notify\r\n    U. S. Government without delay. Can you hold out forty-eight\r\n    hours? If so, turn flag.\r\n\r\n                                                          “JACKSON.\r\n                                                          “BORDERWELL.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Jackson and Borderwell, whoever they may be!” cried Jack,\r\nhappily. “Come on! Let’s turn the flag right side up!” and this was\r\nquickly done.\r\n\r\nAgain the hydroplane made a turn, this time wider than before. Then the\r\nflying machine passed over the wreck at a lower level, and they could\r\nsee the two aviators peering anxiously down at them. They waved the\r\nflag in delight and Andy and Randy threw kisses to show that everything\r\nwas all right. Then they saw each of the aviators wave their arms in\r\nreturn. A few seconds later the hydroplane passed southward once more.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet she’s bound for Porto Rico!” cried Jack, and in this surmise\r\nhe was correct.\r\n\r\n“If only we could have sent word to the folks that we’re safe!” sighed\r\nFred.\r\n\r\nBut even with this drawback, the boys felt tremendously relieved, and\r\nhad it not been for his twisted ankle Andy would have danced a jig of\r\njoy. Their situation would soon be known to the outside world, and they\r\nwere certain that relief would not be slow in coming.\r\n\r\n“Forty-eight hours won’t be so long to wait,” said Randy. “Why, that’s\r\nonly two days!”\r\n\r\n“That will give us time to hunt for the pirates’ gold!” exclaimed the\r\nlanky sailor. “I wish my leg was better. I’d climb over them stones\r\nsomehow or other and git to the middle of the circle of the thirteen\r\nrocks.”\r\n\r\n“Now that we know that help is coming, we can spend all our time in\r\ntrying to locate the gold,” said Randy. “Why not take another trip\r\nalong the base of the rocks in the scow? We can post a notice here\r\ntelling where we’ve gone, so that if any one arrives they’ll wait for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThey finished their interrupted meal and then decided to make another\r\ntour in the scow without delay. It was very calm, the wind having gone\r\ndown completely, so they felt they could approach quite close to the\r\ncliffs without much danger of another wreck.\r\n\r\nFor fully two hours the party of five moved slowly along the rocky\r\nshore, inspecting every foot of the way for some hidden trail by which\r\nthey might get to the bowl encircled by the thirteen rocks.\r\n\r\n“There might be an opening behind that bunch of vines,” remarked Andy,\r\npresently. “It looks as if there were some sort of opening there.”\r\n\r\nThey had brought with them several long-handled boathooks, and by means\r\nof these they managed to make a landing on the rocks, and Randy and\r\nFred climbed to the point where the vines mentioned were growing. Here\r\nthey found an opening several yards in depth, inhabited by numerous sea\r\nbirds that flocked forth in much astonishment.\r\n\r\n“There is an opening,” shouted Randy, after throwing the rays of the\r\nsearchlight around, “but it doesn’t lead to anything. It’s just a blind\r\npocket.”\r\n\r\nAfter this the search was continued for another hour, and the boys\r\nvisited two other places along the rocky barrier. One was thickly\r\nmatted with vines, and here they found the foothold very uncertain, and\r\nJack and Fred, who were doing the climbing, came close to tumbling down\r\ninto the ocean.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t look as if there was any sort of an opening around here,” came\r\ndolefully from Andy. He was sorry that he could not do some of the\r\nclimbing himself, but he knew that he had to take care of his hurt\r\nankle or that member might become so bad that he could not use it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“We won’t give up yit!” cried Ira Small. “I’m goin’ to git down in that\r\ncircle of rocks if I’ve got to stay behind on the island all alone!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we wouldn’t dream of going off without you, Small,” answered\r\nRandy, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I ain’t goin’ to leave till I’ve made a search,” answered the\r\nold tar, stubbornly. “That thing’s been in my mind fur five years, an’\r\nI ain’t goin’ to give up now when I know where them rocks are located.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’ll have to get an airship in which to get down into the\r\nbowl,” said Andy, making a wry face.\r\n\r\nAgain they went on, and now they were less than an eighth of a mile\r\nfrom where the rocky wall came to an end and the jungle took its place,\r\nleading, a short distance farther along, to the entrance to the little\r\nbay which Jack and Randy had navigated on the raft.\r\n\r\n“What a lot of birds,” remarked Jack, as they went along close to the\r\nrocky cliff. “I never saw so many in my life.”\r\n\r\n“It would be easy to get enough for a bird pot-pie――if a fellow wanted\r\nit,” added Andy, with a grin. Then, however, the fun-loving Rover shut\r\nhis mouth tightly and began to rub his hurt ankle.\r\n\r\n“Hurt very much, Andy?” asked Fred, kindly.\r\n\r\n“It starts up every once in a while,” was the answer. “I don’t notice\r\nit, and then of a sudden it seems to go right back on me.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to see a doctor――just as soon as we can get to where there\r\nis one,” put in his brother.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. But I’ll wait till we get home first.”\r\n\r\nAs they moved along both the boys and the lanky sailor kept their eyes\r\non all the flat rocks which were passed. Presently Fred saw what he\r\ntook to be the picture of an arrow carved on one of the rocks, and he\r\npointed this out to the others. Close to the arrow grew some trailing\r\nvines from a small opening just above.\r\n\r\n“Gee, that does look like an arrow!” cried Andy, with interest.\r\n\r\n“Yes. But there were to be three arrows forming a triangle,” remarked\r\nhis twin.\r\n\r\nCurious to know if the mark was really meant for an arrow, they sculled\r\nthe scow in closer to the rocks and then pulled the vines aside with\r\none of the long boathooks.\r\n\r\n“There are the three arrows, just as plain as day!” burst out Jack.\r\n\r\nHe was right. There, on the face of a large upright rock, the\r\nrepresentation of three arrows had been cut. Each arrow was about two\r\nfeet in length, the bottom one horizontal and the others running down\r\nto a base probably four feet long.\r\n\r\n“It’s a triangle, all right enough! A triangle with the three angles\r\nleft open!” ejaculated Randy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but where is the opening?” came quickly from Ira Small. He was as\r\nmuch excited as any of the boys.\r\n\r\n“It must be up behind those vines!” cried Fred.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task to get up the side of the smooth rock, and had it\r\nnot been for the substantial boathooks they carried and the support of\r\nsome of the vines, they would have been unable to make it. However,\r\nJack and Randy managed finally to reach the opening and speedily began\r\nan investigation. But this amounted to nothing. The opening was very\r\nirregular, and all the passages leading from it went up instead of down.\r\n\r\n“How are you making out?” shouted Andy, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Nothing doing up here, as far as I can see,” announced Jack.\r\n\r\n“Maybe there’s some sort of a secret trapdoor,” suggested Fred,\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\nFor over a quarter of an hour Randy and Jack continued their\r\ninvestigations of the little opening just above the triangle of arrows.\r\nThen they came to the edge of the hole and looked down blankly at those\r\non the scow.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use,” said Randy, disconsolately. “If there’s any passageway\r\nhere, we can’t find it.”\r\n\r\nWhile the search was in progress, those on the scow had had no easy\r\ntime of it to keep the craft from becoming damaged on the rocks. Now,\r\nas an extra large wave rolled in from the ocean, Fred used one of the\r\nboathooks as a fender. But the hook on the end of the pole slipped\r\ndown, and the next instant boy and pole disappeared from view into the\r\nocean at the base of the rocky cliff!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                    IN THE CIRCLE OF THIRTEEN ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fred’s gone!”\r\n\r\n“Push the scow back! Otherwise he’ll be smashed!”\r\n\r\nSuch were the excited exclamations as the youngest Rover boy disappeared\r\nover the front end of the clumsy scow which was now being turned\r\nsideways by the force of the waves.\r\n\r\nAll expected the boy to reappear, and they waited anxiously for several\r\nseconds. Then, as he failed to show himself, their anxiety turned to\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n“Where is he? Where did he go?” gasped Jack, peering down from the\r\nopening above.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Andy. “He was pushing on the boathook and it\r\nslipped and he and the pole went down into the water.”\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose is keeping him down?” questioned Randy, who was\r\nalso peering anxiously from the opening above.\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me,” answered his twin. “Gee, this is fierce!”\r\n\r\n“He was sucked under!” spluttered Ira Small, excitedly. “Sucked under!\r\nThere must be some kind of a hole under them rocks!”\r\n\r\n“If he’s in a hole, we’ve got to get him out,” returned Jack, and\r\nregardless of the danger, he leaped down into the water beside the scow\r\nand then climbed on board.\r\n\r\nRandy quickly followed him. Then the searchlight was played upon\r\nthe water where the youngest of the Rover boys had so mysteriously\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“I see the hole in the rocks!” cried Jack, an instant later. “It’s less\r\nthan two feet under water. Here! Give me that rope. You fellows pull in\r\nwhen I give a jerk. I’ll try to find him.”\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling the young major fastened one end of the rope he had\r\nindicated around his body under his arms. Then, without further ado,\r\nhe leaped into the ocean. Another wave was coming in, and this swept\r\nhim down under the rocks exactly as it had swept Fred. The young major\r\nfelt himself hurled forward, and then, of a sudden, his feet struck\r\nsome sloping sand. He pushed his way onward and presently found himself\r\nstanding up in water less than a foot deep and in almost total darkness.\r\n\r\n“Fred! Fred!” he called out, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” was the quick response, and the next moment his cousin\r\nstood beside him. He was panting for breath.\r\n\r\n“I’ve found the opening,” spluttered the youngest Rover. “But I didn’t\r\ndo it in the way I supposed.”\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least, Jack. But I don’t know how I’m going to get back――or\r\nhow you’re going to get back, either,” went on Fred. And just then\r\nanother wave came rushing in on the pair, coming up to their waists and\r\nthen receding.\r\n\r\n“I’m fast to a rope. You catch hold of me and we’ll both get out, I\r\nthink, without a great deal of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“This must be the passageway, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. But just now we’d better return to the scow. The others are\r\nall afraid you were drowned.”\r\n\r\nWith Fred holding to the rope, they waited until another wave was\r\ncoming in and then jerked upon the line. Then, as the wave receded,\r\nthey rushed along with it, protecting themselves as much as possible\r\nfrom such rocks as might be over their heads. They felt the line\r\ntighten, and in a few seconds more came out into the daylight and were\r\nhauled close to the scow.\r\n\r\n“Fred!”\r\n\r\n“Gee, but I’m glad you’re all right!”\r\n\r\nSuch were the cries from Andy and Randy as the youngest Rover boy and\r\nthe young major crawled aboard the scow. They were somewhat winded, and\r\nit was half a minute before they recovered sufficiently to tell of what\r\nthey had seen.\r\n\r\n“That must be the passageway!” cried Ira Small excitedly. “Mebby you\r\nkin git in it with a rowboat when the tide is low. Anyway, I think we\r\nought to investigate.”\r\n\r\nThe boys thought so, too, and they calculated that the water would be\r\nat its lowest about three hours later.\r\n\r\n“It will be dark by that time,” was Andy’s comment.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” answered Jack. “I’m going to see what sort of place\r\nthat is before I leave this island.”\r\n\r\n“I think we can get in and out of that hole without a rope,” said Fred.\r\n“I mean while the water covers it. Just the same, it might be a good\r\nthing to fasten a line out here on the rocks and then carry it inside.\r\nThen a fellow could haul himself out if he had to.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was thought a good one, and in the end a heavy hawser\r\nwas fastened on the rocks and then carried by Jack and Fred through the\r\nopening under water. Then, while the water was gradually going down,\r\nthe others fastened the scow as best they could, and also entered the\r\nwatery passageway under the cliff.\r\n\r\nIt was not such a hazardous thing to do, nor so terrifying, when they\r\nunderstood just how the opening was located. All reached the sandy\r\nbeach under the cliff without mishap. They carried the searchlight,\r\nwhich was of the water-tight variety, and with the aid of this soon\r\nmade their way under the base of the cliff to where there was a\r\nfair-sized opening on the inner side.\r\n\r\n“Here we are!” exclaimed Jack, in delight. “That must be the passageway,\r\nbeyond a doubt!”\r\n\r\nOnce in the open, they saw that the irregular bowl encircled by the\r\nthirteen pointed rocks was just ahead of them. The path was rough, but\r\nwell defined, and they had little trouble in following it.\r\n\r\n“Gee! what a desolate place this is,” remarked Andy, as they pushed\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nHe had good reason for making that remark. On every side of them were\r\nthe bare rocks, lying in all sorts of fantastic shapes. Here and there\r\nwere a few stunted bushes and trailing vines. There was nothing in\r\nthe way of a jungle; not a tree showed itself; nor were there any\r\nindications of water.\r\n\r\n“This is what I call stony lonely and no mistake,” was the way Fred\r\nexpressed himself.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached a point almost at the bottom of the rocky bowl.\r\nNow they could gaze around them and see the thirteen rocky points quite\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n“It’s them thirteen rocks, and no mistake!” said Ira Small, with\r\nsatisfaction. “An’ we found the triangle, too! So that pirates’ gold\r\nmust be somewheres close at hand.”\r\n\r\n“Unless some one else has been here before us and taken it away,”\r\nanswered Jack. “Don’t be too much disappointed if we find it gone.\r\nThese pirate treasures have been hunted for years by thousands of\r\ntreasure seekers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m goin’ to make certain if it’s here or not before I leave\r\nthis island!” answered the lanky sailor, determinedly.\r\n\r\nIt was now growing dark, the setting sun casting long and grotesque\r\nshadows across the hollow where they were traveling. Soon night came\r\non, just at a time when they were trying to decide where the center of\r\nthe jagged bowl might be.\r\n\r\n“We’ll probably have to stay here all night,” said Jack. “I don’t\r\nbelieve we can do much in the darkness.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come on! Let’s do what we can,” cried Andy, eagerly. He was so\r\nexcited that for the time being he had almost forgotten his hurt ankle.\r\n\r\nThe other boys were equally interested, and it must be confessed that\r\nthe lanky sailor was as wild as any of them. He, too, had forgotten\r\nall about his injured leg, and he strode on over the rocks, looking in\r\nevery direction for some sign that might indicate where the pirates’\r\ngold was hidden.\r\n\r\nIt was now so dark that they had only the searchlight to guide them,\r\nand this seemed to be growing dimmer.\r\n\r\n“I suppose the battery is giving out,” said Jack, and then the thought\r\noccurred to each of them: What would they do if the flashlight failed?\r\nThey would then be left in utter darkness, and even though they carried\r\nmatches in a waterproof box there was nothing at hand with which to\r\nbuild a fire.\r\n\r\nThey stumbled along for a hundred feet or more over the rough rocks,\r\nand then Fred gave a sudden cry:\r\n\r\n“Look there! Can that be the place?”\r\n\r\nAll gazed at the spot pointed out, at the same time centering the rays\r\nfrom the fast-fading flashlight on the place. They saw a curious mound\r\nof stones, evidently built up by hand. The stones averaged the size of\r\nbricks, and arose in a pyramid to the height of several feet.\r\n\r\n“That’s it! That’s it!” yelled Ira Small, excitedly. “That’s the place!\r\nI remember one of them sailors said there was stones heaped on the flat\r\nrock like the pyramids of Egypt, only, o’ course, not so high!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that heap was certainly placed there by hand and not by nature,”\r\nanswered Jack. “Come on, let’s throw the stones aside and see what is\r\nunder the pile!”\r\n\r\nAll set to work, including the lanky sailor, and it may well be\r\nbelieved that the stones composing the pyramid were quickly scattered\r\nin all directions. At the bottom, they came upon a flat rock resting\r\nupon four other rocks which evidently had an opening between them.\r\n\r\n“Some rock!” said Jack, as he surveyed it. “We’ll have our own trouble\r\nmoving it, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\nThe searchlight was placed a few feet away, and the boys and the\r\nsailor set to work to move the heavy flat stone which rested on the\r\nfour others. At first they could not budge the stone, but finally they\r\nbrought it up on one edge and let it fall over on the other side.\r\nUnderneath, in a square hollow, they saw more small stones, evidently\r\npacked in by hand and tamped down. They had a job removing two or three\r\nof these, but then the others came up easily.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Here’s a handle of some sort!” exclaimed Randy, feverishly. “I\r\nbelieve it’s the handle of a box!”\r\n\r\nAll saw the handle, which was about five inches long and so rusted and\r\nmildewed they could not make out of what material it was composed. Jack\r\nand Randy, aided by the old tar, pulled upon it with might and main and\r\npresently brought to light a small chest evidently of iron, brass, or\r\nsome hard wood――what, they could not determine for at that instant the\r\nrays of the flashlight died away, leaving them in total darkness.\r\n\r\n“It’s a chest!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if the pirates’ gold is in it!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, gee! why did that light have to go out just now?” grumbled Andy,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n“Make a light, somebody. We’ve got to find out what this thing is!”\r\nsaid Fred.\r\n\r\nJack was already bringing forth the waterproof match-box, and now he\r\nstruck one of the matches and held it over the chest. It was so covered\r\nwith mildew and other evidences of age that he could hardly make out\r\nwhich was the front and which the back of the receptacle.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if we only had a torch or something to make a fire with!” moaned\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n“Wait! I’ve got something!” exclaimed Ira Small, suddenly, and, diving\r\ndown into a pocket of his jacket, he brought forth a bit of candle not\r\nover two inches in length.\r\n\r\n“Picked it up on the yacht,” he explained. “Thought it might come in\r\nhandy some time.”\r\n\r\nThe bit of candle was lit, and then all looked down the hole to see if\r\nanything further might be there. But only the solid rock met their gaze.\r\n\r\n“Smash it open, boys! Smash it open!” went on the lanky sailor, still\r\nas excited as ever. “We want to see what the box contains before that\r\ncandle is burnt up――an’ it won’t last very long.”\r\n\r\nThey found a small lock on the box, much rusted and without a key. With\r\nrocks they finally succeeded in smashing the lock. Then they pried back\r\nthe lid of the box. A sheet of what had once evidently been perfectly\r\ngood leather met their gaze. The sailor thrust this aside and then dove\r\nboth hands into the box, bringing up a mass of old and much tarnished\r\ncoins.\r\n\r\n“Pirates’ gold!” he exclaimed, excitedly. “Doubloons! Hundreds of them!\r\nWe’ve got the pirates’ gold at last!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                  WHAT THE BOX CONTAINED――CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n“Look at the gold!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what it’s worth?”\r\n\r\n“Those sailors told the truth, after all!”\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the exclamations made by the Rover boys as they gazed\r\nat the contents of the chest pulled out of the rocky hole before them.\r\n\r\nBut if they were excited, Ira Small was more so, and for a few minutes\r\nthe boys thought the old tar would go crazy. Again and again he dove\r\nhis hands into the chest, to bring up the coins and let them fall back\r\nwith a merry clink.\r\n\r\n“I knowed we’d find it!” he cried. “Now I’ll be a rich man fur life!”\r\nAnd then he added quickly to the boys: “But you’re to have your share\r\nof it, lads. One-half of whatever is here goes to Jack an’ the rest of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThey were still looking over the coins in the chest when the bit of\r\ncandle spluttered up and went out.\r\n\r\n“Never mind! I don’t care how dark it is now,” said Andy. “We’ve found\r\nthe treasure, and that’s enough.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to stay here all night,” returned Jack. “We’ll never be\r\nable to find our way out in the darkness.”\r\n\r\n“What do we care?” put in Randy, lightly. “I don’t believe any wild\r\nanimals are going to bother us in this out-of-the-way hole. Those\r\npirates certainly buried their gold in a spot where it was hard to\r\nfind,” he added.\r\n\r\nSitting around in the darkness, the boys and the old sailor discussed\r\nthe situation from every possible angle. They could make only a wild\r\nestimate of what the contents of the chest was worth, but knew it would\r\nrun into many thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nTheir exertions that day had worn them out completely, and presently\r\nall were glad to make themselves as comfortable as possible on the\r\nrocks and go to sleep. They set no guard, and such a precaution would\r\nhave been unnecessary, for no wild animals came to disturb them.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they took another look at the contents of the chest, and\r\nthen, while it was still early daylight, set out for the passageway\r\nunder the cliff. It took them two hours to clamber to this place and\r\ntwo hours more to get out to the clumsy scow and rig up a hawser so\r\nthat they could haul the chest on board.\r\n\r\n“Now we’ve got it we don’t want to lose it,” said Ira Small anxiously,\r\nand so the ancient box was handled with care.\r\n\r\nOnce aboard the clumsy scow, they set out upon the return to the\r\nwrecked steam yacht.\r\n\r\n“We’ll certainly have a story to tell when we get home,” said Fred to\r\nhis cousins. “Do you know, I had half a notion that that story about\r\npirates’ gold was a fairy yarn.”\r\n\r\n“So did I, Fred,” said Randy. “But, of course, it’s well known that\r\npirates did bury their treasures around the West Indies.”\r\n\r\nOnce aboard the wreck, the boys and the old sailor washed and brushed\r\nup the best they could, and then prepared for themselves a much-needed\r\nmeal. After this they sat down to look over the contents of the chest\r\nmore carefully and to wait as patiently as possible for those who might\r\ncome to their rescue.\r\n\r\n“These are Spanish doubloons all right enough,” said Jack. “But what\r\nthey’re worth, I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they’re not all doubloons,” answered Randy. “Some of these\r\ncoins seem to be copper.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s quite a find, anyhow, Randy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I agree with you on that!”\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the next day a vessel hove in sight which proved\r\nto be an auxiliary cruiser of the United States Navy. Again the boys\r\nand the old tar set up their signal of distress, and soon a small boat\r\ncontaining a couple of officers and a number of men reached the wreck.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Hurrah!” shouted Andy, as they came up. “Now we’re safe!”\r\n\r\n“What vessel is this?” asked one of the officers, as soon as he had\r\nfound out who the party were; and when told he said that the _Coryanda_\r\nhad been reported water-logged and about to sink two weeks before.\r\n\r\n“She belongs to two scientists from Baltimore,” he said. “They had a\r\nvaluable collection of wild animals, snakes and birds on board.”\r\n\r\n“So they did!” answered Jack. “And, believe me, we had some fun with\r\nthose creatures! A few of them are dead, and the rest of them were\r\neither drowned or escaped to this island.” And then he and his cousins\r\nand the old tar told their story.\r\n\r\n“Did those two men, Jackson and Borderwell, who were in the hydroplane\r\nand flew over the wreck, notify you?” questioned Jack, curiously.\r\n\r\n“They did,” answered the leading officer. “They were sent out on a\r\nscouting expedition,” he explained. “After such storms as we have had\r\nlately we often find wrecks floating around in this vicinity.”\r\n\r\n“Well, those men certainly deserve our thanks,” put in Randy, and the\r\nother boys and Ira Small agreed with him.\r\n\r\nMany of the things of value on the wreck were taken to the cruiser, and\r\nthen the boys and the old tar went on board. The cruiser was from Porto\r\nRico, but was bound for Norfolk, for which the boys were thankful.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s good-bye to the island!” cried Jack, as they steamed away.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and good-bye to whatever of the wild animals and snakes are left!”\r\n\r\n“Gee! what of the monkeys we left tied up?” questioned Jack, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“They’re not tied up,” answered Andy. “I didn’t have the heart to do\r\nit, so I cut them loose when we were leaving camp.”\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary cruiser was, of course, supplied with radio, and the lads\r\nlost no time in sending a message to their parents. A few hours later\r\ncame a return message, relayed from New York City, stating that the\r\nfathers of the four boys were on the way to meet them as soon as they\r\nlanded at Norfolk.\r\n\r\nIt can well be imagined how impatient the boys were to reach home. Yet\r\nevery time they thought of joining their parents and Mary and Martha a\r\ntinge of sadness crept into their minds.\r\n\r\n“Poor Ralph, Gif and Spouter!” murmured Jack. “How we shall miss them!”\r\n\r\nWhen at last Norfolk was reached, the boys could hardly wait to get\r\nashore. There were their fathers ready to greet them, and my readers\r\ncan rest assured that all received the warmest kind of welcome.\r\n\r\n“We were hoping against hope when your message came,” declared Dick\r\nRover. “We thought the motor boat had been lost with all on board.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve been watching all the shipping reports for days,” added Tom\r\nRover. “We knew there had been some terrible storms, and the papers\r\nhave reported half a dozen wrecks. We were sure no motor boat could\r\nlive in such weather.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve got bad news,” said Randy, sorrowfully. “Spouter, Gif and\r\nRalph――――”\r\n\r\n“Are all safe!” burst in Sam Rover.\r\n\r\n“Safe!” came simultaneously from the four Rover boys.\r\n\r\n“Yes, safe! We got a message from them only yesterday. They were picked\r\nup by a vessel bound for Spain, and they are now on their way home.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! This is the best yet!” cried Andy, and tried to do a jig\r\nin spite of his hurt ankle. Later on the poor fellow had to go to a\r\nhospital to have the ankle readjusted. But the operation was not a\r\nsevere one, and soon his ankle was as well as ever.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor went home with the boys and was warmly thanked for all\r\nthe assistance he had given the lads during their perilous days on the\r\nocean and on the island.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the pirates’ chest was gone over carefully, and then\r\nDick Rover advised that a well known numismatist be called in.\r\n\r\n“What in the world is a numismicks?” demanded Ira Small, and when he\r\nwas told what was meant, he agreed at once that what Dick Rover had\r\nsuggested be done.\r\n\r\nThe numismatist went over all of the coins carefully and declared many\r\nof them valuable, not only intrinsically, but on account of their age\r\nand rarity. He took charge of the whole affair, and in the end the\r\ntreasure brought in twenty-four thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n“An’ half of it goes to the boys. I won’t have it no other way,”\r\ndeclared the lanky sailor. And so each of the boys was able to place\r\nthree thousand dollars to his own bank account.\r\n\r\n“Well, we certainly had great times on that trip!” declared Randy. “I\r\ndon’t suppose we’ll ever have such strenuous times again.” But Randy\r\ncould not look into the future. Strenuous days were still to come for\r\nthe boys, and what some of them were will be related in another volume,\r\nto be entitled “The Rover Boys on Sunset Trail; or, The Old Miner’s\r\nMysterious Message.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until later that the boys learned that the two scientists\r\nfrom Baltimore who owned the _Coryanda_ had been saved along with all\r\nbut two of those who had been aboard the ill-fated steam yacht. About\r\nthe _Hildegarde_ they heard nothing for many months, but one day Ira\r\nSmall turned up with the information that the rum-runner had been lost\r\nin the hurricane and not a soul had been saved.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jack, I’m so glad you got back safe and sound,” said Ruth\r\nStevenson, when she met the young major. “You can’t imagine how worried\r\nall of us were!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m mighty glad to be back, Ruth,” he answered. “We’re all glad\r\nto be back. It was no fun being cast away on the ocean on that bit of\r\nwreckage and then to get on a water-logged yacht that had a lot of wild\r\nanimals and snakes aboard.”\r\n\r\n“What are they going to do about those wild animals and snakes?”\r\nquestioned Martha.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care,” answered her brother. “One such\r\nexperience was enough for me.”\r\n\r\n“I guess it was enough for all of us,” put in Randy.\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t mind having that little monkey back,” came from Andy.\r\n“But as for the rest of the beasts――not for me!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Here’s a letter from Ralph, Spouter and Gif!” cried Fred,\r\nbursting in upon his cousins. “They’re coming back to America just as\r\nfast as a steamer can bring them.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the Rover boys are reading the letter from their chums,\r\nwe will say good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _This Isn’t All!_\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like to know what became of the good friends you have made in\r\nthis book?\r\n\r\nWould you like to read other stories continuing their adventures and\r\nexperiences, or other books quite as entertaining by the same author?\r\n\r\nOn the _reverse side_ of the wrapper which comes with this book, you\r\nwill find a wonderful list of stories which you can buy at the same\r\nstore where you got this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Don’t throw away the Wrapper_\r\n\r\n_Use it as a handy catalog of the books you want some day to have.\r\nBut in case you do mislay it, write to the Publishers for a complete\r\ncatalog._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TOM SWIFT SERIES\r\n\r\n                          By VICTOR APPLETON\r\n\r\n                  Author of “The Don Sturdy Series.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery boy possesses some form of inventive genius.
