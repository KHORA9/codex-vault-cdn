Rat proofing in the broadest sense embraces not\r\nonly the exclusion of rats from buildings of all types but also the\r\nelimination of their hiding and nesting places and cutting off their\r\nfood supply. Through open doors and in other ways, rats may frequently\r\ngain access to structures that are otherwise rat proof, but they can\r\nnot persist there unless they find safe retreats and food. When rat\r\nproofing becomes the regular practice the rat problem will have been\r\nlargely solved.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D. C.

They call for\r\nthe liberal use of indestructible and noncombustible materials, as\r\nwell-made concrete and steel, and these are too much for even the\r\nsharpest of rodent incisors. They include, also, fire stopping in\r\ndouble walls and floors and the elimination of all dead spaces and dark\r\ncorners, and the rat is left no place in which to hide. They embody\r\nsanitary features that provide for hygienic storage of food, and the\r\nrat can not live without something to eat.\r\n\r\nMany men have devoted their lives to a study of methods of rat control,\r\nand as a result countless preparations, devices, and contrivances are\r\nconstantly being made available. Trapping, snaring, trailing, flooding,\r\ndigging, hunting, ferreting, poisoning, and fumigating are employed,\r\nand rat limes, rat lures, rat repellents, and bacterial viruses are\r\nresorted to, and even antirat laws, local. State, and national, are\r\nconstantly being passed in a world-wide effort to conquer this rodent.\r\nThese have been important factors in keeping down the surplus, but\r\nall destructive agencies that have been used have utterly failed to\r\nreduce materially the total number of rats in the world. Rat proofing,\r\nhowever, is at last making definite headway against the age-old enemy\r\nof mankind, and it is upon this that the ultimate solution of the rat\r\nproblem will depend.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of rats for temporary relief and for keeping them under\r\ncontrol in places where rat proofing is not possible or practicable\r\nwill always be necessary, and knowledge of the best means of destroying\r\nrats is essential to any rat-control program. Information on poisoning,\r\ntrapping, and other means of destroying rats is given in Farmers'\r\nBulletin 1533, Rat Control. Permanent freedom from rats, however,\r\nshould be the goal of everyone troubled with the pests and rat proofing\r\noffers the best means to this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RAT PROOFING\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery separate structure presents its individual problem, but there\r\nare two general principles that apply in all cases and that should be\r\nkept in mind when the rat proofing of any building is being considered.\r\nFirst, the exterior of those parts of the structure accessible to\r\nrats, including porches or other appurtenances, must be constructed\r\nof materials resistant to the gnawing of rats, and all openings must\r\nbe either permanently closed or protected with doors, gratings, or\r\nscreens; second, the interior of the building must provide no dead spaces,\r\nsuch as double walls, spaces between ceilings and floors, staircases,\r\nand boxed-in piping, or any other places where a rat might find safe\r\nharborage, unless they are permanently sealed with impervious materials.\r\n\r\nAll new buildings should be made rat proof. When plans are being\r\ndrawn for a building, the rat problem is frequently overlooked,\r\nusually because rats are not often present near sites selected for\r\nnew structures. They are certain to come later, however, and should\r\ntherefore be taken into account. Modern structures are so nearly\r\nrat proof that to make them completely so requires only slight and\r\ninexpensive changes. Furthermore, rat proofing is closely associated\r\nwith fire stopping and with sanitary measures that are now required by\r\nlaw in many places. Cities in growing numbers have added rat proofing\r\nclauses to their building ordinances with such good effect that others\r\nare sure to follow their lead. Builders should therefore compare the\r\ncost of rat proofing during construction with the probable later cost,\r\nin case local laws should require that all buildings be made rat proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAT PROOFING FARM BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of rat proofing the entire premises of many American farms\r\nwould amount to less than the loss occasioned by rats on the same\r\nfarms during a single year. In no other place is rat proofing more\r\nbadly needed or less often accomplished than on the farm. There are,\r\nhowever, numerous examples of rat-proof farms in nearly every county in\r\nthe United States, and almost invariably they are the more prosperous\r\nfarms, for the rat proofing of a farm is an indication that the farmer\r\nhas learned the necessity of stopping all small leaks, which mean\r\nreduced profits.\r\n\r\nA rat-proof farm is not necessarily one in which the entire farmstead\r\nis absolutely proofed, but rather one where conditions are so\r\nunfavorable for any invading rats that they either will desert the\r\npremises of their own accord or may be easily routed by man or dogs.\r\nThe source of the trouble on almost any heavily rat-infested farm can\r\nbe traced directly to conditions that furnish rats safe refuges near\r\nabundant food. The commoner of these rat-breeding places are beneath\r\nwooden floors set a few inches off the ground in poultry houses, barns,\r\nstables, granaries, corncribs, and even residences; in piles of fuel\r\nwood, lumber, and refuse; in straw, hay, and manure piles that remain\r\nundisturbed for long periods beneath concrete floors without curtain\r\nwalls; and inside double walls of buildings. In rat proofing the\r\nfarmstead as a whole, attention should first be paid to the premises\r\noutside the buildings and later to each building separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B31216\r\n\r\nFigure 1.--An automatic garbage can, always closed]\r\n\r\nNeatness is of prime importance in keeping a place free from, rats,\r\nand providing facilities for keeping it neat should be considered part\r\nof the rat-proofing program. An incinerator, which can be made from a\r\ndiscarded metal drum or rolled-up poultry netting, is convenient for\r\nburning all trash and combustible waste; and a deep, covered pit with\r\na trapdoor will take care of tin cans and other noncombustibles, if it\r\nis not practicable to haul them away at regular intervals. A covered\r\ngarbage can is also indispensable on farms where table scraps are not\r\nfed directly to poultry or hogs. (Fig. 1.) Raised platforms, 18 or more\r\ninches high, should be provided upon which to pile lumber or other\r\nmaterials that if placed on the ground would afford shelter for rats.\r\n(Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nLarge piles of cut stove wood on many northern farms become rat\r\ninfested. The same is true of manure piles adjoining barns and, to a\r\nlesser extent, of hay and straw stacks near farm buildings. These do\r\nnot provide food and are attractive to rats for harbors only if near\r\na source of food supply; moving them to a place at some distance from\r\nwhere foodstuffs are handled will usually solve the problem.\r\n\r\nStone walls at times furnish excellent harborage for rats but, like the\r\nwoodpile, only if there is ample food near by. Stone walls supporting\r\nembankments and driveways on sloping farmsteads are most frequently\r\ninfested, and when this occurs the inviting openings can usually be\r\nreadily closed with small stones and cement.\r\n\r\nDitch banks often are a source of rat infestation, but in most climates\r\nduring the warmer months only. The rodents concentrate in such places\r\nbecause they are less likely to be disturbed there. Rat proofing the\r\nditch bank consists merely of burning or otherwise destroying the\r\nprotective vegetation. This, of course, affords only temporary relief\r\nand should not be considered strictly rat proofing.\r\n\r\nThe use of concrete in the construction of most farm buildings is\r\nusually the best means of permanently excluding the rat. Fortunately,\r\nmany of the fundamentals of rat proofing are also principles of good\r\nconstruction. As am example, in order to support a building properly,\r\nthe foundation should extend well into the ground below the frost line;\r\nrat proofing likewise requires that the foundation wall extend at\r\nleast 2 feet below the surface. Rats seldom burrow deeper than 2 feet\r\nunless natural passageways assist. Foundation walls should project a\r\nfoot or more above the ground in order to protect the wooden parts of\r\nthe building, and this also lessens the opportunity for rats to gnaw\r\nthrough the wall. A rat is not likely to cling to the exposed exterior\r\nof a building a foot above the ground while it gnaws a hole through\r\nwooden sheathing or siding. It would do so very quickly, however, if\r\nsuch siding extended to the ground, where its work could be under cover\r\nof vegetation or behind some object, particularly when the siding\r\nbecomes somewhat rotted, as would soon happen were it close to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B3139M\r\n\r\nFigure 2.--Lumber and other stored materials piled well off the ground\r\nto prevent rat harborage]\r\n\r\nIt is important that concrete be hard, as weak concrete is but a\r\nslight obstacle to the sharp rodent incisors. The mixture approved\r\nfor ordinary building construction, however, is sufficiently hard to\r\nbe entirely rat proof, and it is essential that approved practices of\r\nmixing and placing concrete be followed. Directions for using concrete\r\nand for building concrete floors are given in Farmers' Bulletin 1279,\r\nPlain Concrete for Farm Use, and in Farmers' Bulletin 1480, Small\r\nConcrete Construction on the Farm. Other approved building practices,\r\nsuch as fire stopping double walls, eliminating waste dead spaces,\r\nmaking doors, windows, and ventilators fit tightly, and screening or\r\npermanently stopping all openings, are also necessary in rat proofing.\r\nFor simple farm buildings the foundation illustrated in Figure 3 meets\r\nall the requirements of good construction and will keep the rats out if\r\nthe walls are tight.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNS\r\n\r\nIt is seldom possible to shut out rats completely from barns or\r\nentirely to cut off their food supply where livestock is fed. Little\r\ntrouble will be experienced with them, however, if their harbors are\r\neliminated. In barns rat harbors are most frequently found around\r\nstalls, under wooden mangers, and stall partitions, and beneath wooden\r\nor dirt floors. In modern barns with concrete floors, concrete or metal\r\nmangers, and metal stanchions, such places of retreat are entirely\r\neliminated. In older barns it is desirable at least to replace wooden\r\nand dirt floors with concrete and reconstruct the mangers so that they\r\nare a foot or more off the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Foundation and floor suitable for most types\r\nof farm buildings]\r\n\r\nAnother common source of rat trouble, particularly in the northern half\r\nof the United States, is the hollow wall, within which rats find safe\r\nretreat and convenient runways leading to the haymow. In recent years\r\nfibrous insulating materials have been used to line the interiors of\r\nmany farm buildings, and in most cases these have resulted in greatly\r\nincreased rat infestation. Rats cut through these composition boards\r\nvery easily and seem to be attracted by the facilities for breeding\r\nthus provided. Hollow walls of any kind accessible to rats should\r\neither be eliminated or adequately rat proofed. Such rat proofing may\r\nbe accomplished by filling the hollow spaces to a height of 8 or 10\r\ninches above the sill with cement, bricks, or other material resistant\r\nto the gnawing of rats, or a strip of galvanized metal 2 or more feet\r\nwide may be carried around the inside wall just above the sill.\r\n\r\nOld barns with wooden floors supported a few inches above the ground on\r\ngirders and posts are particularly objectionable from the standpoint\r\nof rat infestation and should be rat proofed with concrete. (Fig. 4.)\r\nA concrete foundation wall extending at least 2 feet below grade is\r\nplaced under the girder between the posts. The wooden posts may be\r\nremoved after the wall has hardened, and the spaces left should then be\r\nfilled in with concrete. A concrete floor is laid, and cement stucco on\r\nmetal lath is extended up the walls for at least 2 feet, preferably to\r\nthe level of window sills.\r\n\r\nRock foundations in many old barns offer excellent harborage for rats\r\nunless pointed carefully with cement mortar. If possible, the floor\r\nshould be raised to the level of the sill and the walls plastered to\r\nthe window-sill level (fig. 5) in such manner as to prevent access by\r\nrats to spaces between the studs.\r\n\r\nThe grain bin and other similar fixtures must always be considered in\r\nrat proofing a barn. It is most important that they be so situated or\r\nconstructed that there shall be no hiding places for rats behind or\r\nunder them. The grain bin should be completely lined or covered with\r\nmetal and should have metal-clad lids. Any open spaces behind or under\r\nthe bins should be tightly closed with metal. (Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--A, Detail of old barn with floor supported\r\na few inches above ground on girders and posts; B, same barn made rat\r\nproof with concrete foundation and floors and cement-plastered walls]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Method of rat proofing old stable, A.\r\nConcreting and plastering as shown in B makes for better sanitary\r\nconditions behind stock]\r\n\r\nOther accessories of various kinds of barns should be examined\r\ncarefully and remodeled or moved if necessary to exclude rats or\r\neliminate harbors. The haymow frequently presents a difficult problem\r\nin a heavily infested barn, but the haymow alone is seldom responsible\r\nfor the rats, for if all other rat harbors in the barn are effectively\r\neliminated or shut off, the rats will not long remain with the hay as\r\ntheir only shelter. If the lower walls are of rough surface or composed\r\nof open studs covered on the outside, rats can climb at the corners.\r\nThey may be prevented from doing so by the application of a strip of\r\nmetal 8 inches wide placed just below the joists of the upper floor.\r\nRecommended construction of walls and floors in new frame barns is\r\nshown in Figure 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--A convenient upper-story rat-proof grain bin]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Recommended construction of walls and floors\r\nof new frame barns. Cement plaster on metal lath or Insulating board is\r\napplied to the inside of the studs at least to the level of the window\r\nsills as a better protection against rats and as being more easily kept\r\nclean than wooden lining]\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNCRIBS\r\n\r\nOf all the buildings on the average farm the corncrib is usually in\r\ngreatest need of rat proofing. Losses sometimes amounting to a fourth\r\nor a third of the total quantity of corn held over winter have been\r\nknown. A survey in a southern State showed an average loss of 5 per\r\ncent of corn in storage; in one case 500 bushels were destroyed in\r\none crib during one winter. The amount of this loss would have been\r\nsufficient to pay for rat proofing the crib several times over. In\r\nbuilding or remodeling a corncrib; therefore, it is most important that\r\nit be made permanently rat proof. Probably the most satisfactory method\r\nof accomplishing this with the common slat-sided corncrib is entirely\r\nto cover the walls and ceiling on the inside and the wooden floors on\r\nthe under side with woven-wire mesh or hardware cloth, two or three\r\nmeshes to the inch. A heavy grade of woven wire should be used, 12 or\r\n15 gage, and galvanized after weaving. Painting with a tar or asphaltic\r\npaint increases its durability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Suggested construction for corncrib: A,\r\nSection through wall; B, section through door, which is made of\r\ncribbing on vertical battens; the metal band on the wall extends across\r\nthe door, but is cut and bent Inward at the edges of the door; C, plan\r\nof door; D, enlarged detail of Jamb at closing side of door]\r\n\r\nAnother method, and one that is less expensive and quite effective as\r\nlong as kept in good repair, is shown in Figure 8. Wire netting should\r\nbe carried around the entire crib to a height of 2 feet or more from\r\nthe top of the foundation. A strip of galvanized iron 8 inches wide\r\nshould be fastened above the wire netting. The joints between the\r\nfoundation and netting and between the netting and metal strip must\r\nbe tight. As rats are unable to gain a footing on the smooth metal and\r\ncan not climb over it, it is unnecessary to use wire netting above the\r\nstrip. Care should be taken to join the lengths of metal tightly and to\r\ncarry the wire netting and strips of metal across and around both sides\r\nof doors and door jambs. It is also advisable to provide doors with\r\nsprings or weights to insure their remaining closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B31365\r\n\r\nFigure 9.--An inexpensive method of rat proofing a corncrib. It is\r\nsupported by glazed tiles capped with galvanized washtubs, which,\r\nthough not attractive in appearance, have successfully kept out rats]\r\n\r\nIf possible the corncrib should have a concrete foundation and floor,\r\nas illustrated. Otherwise it should be elevated on posts or piers\r\nso that it will have a clearance underneath of feet or more. If\r\nthe supporting posts or piers are covered with sheet metal, or are\r\nprotected at the top with metal collars or disks extending at least 9\r\ninches out from the posts, rats will be kept out of the crib. Old cribs\r\ncan often be rat proofed in this manner at little expense. Dish pans\r\nand washtubs make convenient rat guards. (Fig. 9.) It is important\r\nthat the area beneath the corncrib be kept clear and that nothing that\r\nthe rats can climb be leaned against it.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Plans for a 2,000-bushel corncrib (design No. 521) are available\r\nupon request addressed to the Bureau of Public Roads, U. S. Department\r\nof Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANARIES\r\n\r\nThe rat proofing of granaries is of great importance, because of the\r\nabundance of food stored there and the corresponding opportunity\r\nfor serious loss. The granary with concrete foundation and floors,\r\ntight-fitting doors, and screened ventilators presents no unusual\r\nproblem, except possibly in connection with the elevator pit, which\r\nshould be carefully checked against possible means of ingress for rats.\r\nSmall wooden and portable granaries should be protected with wire\r\nnetting. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\nConcrete feeding floors, troughs (fig. 11), water tanks, hog wallows,\r\nand similar structures should be constructed with a curtain wall, or\r\napron, around the outer edge extending 2 feet or more into the ground\r\n(fig. 12) to keep the rats from burrowing underneath the slab. This\r\nalso tends to prevent the heaving caused by frost and the uneven\r\nsettling of the structure in soft ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Recommended method of rat proofing a\r\nportable granary]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY HOUSES\r\n\r\nIt is not practicable to attempt to exclude rats from poultry houses,\r\nbut such buildings can easily be made proof against serious trouble\r\nby the elimination of all places where the rodents can obtain safe\r\nharborage. Most rat infestation around poultry plants is due to the\r\npresence of numerous shelters and suitable breeding places. Three\r\nthings are particularly to be avoided: Wooden floors on or within a\r\nfew inches of the ground; double walls; and nest boxes, feed hoppers,\r\nand other fixtures placed so as to provide shelter for rats under\r\nor behind them. From a rat-proofing standpoint the floors as well\r\nas the foundation should be made of concrete. (Fig. 13.) If this is\r\nnot considered practicable, wooden floors should be elevated so as\r\nto insure a clear space of 2 or more feet between the floor and the\r\nground. Warmth can be provided, if necessary, by two thicknesses of\r\nflooring with tar paper between. Hollow walls almost invariably furnish\r\nharborage for rats. The inner stud covering therefore, should be\r\ntorn out, but if warmth is a factor to be considered, siding should\r\nbe put over sheathing on the outside of the studs with building paper\r\nbetween.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] The construction of poultry houses and fixtures is described in\r\nFarmers' Bulletin 1554, Poultry Houses and Fixtures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B4390M\r\n\r\nFigure 11.--Rat proof pigpens and feeding troughs are easy to keep\r\nclean and sanitary, and rats have little opportunity to steal the feed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--A concrete curtain wall or apron under a\r\nfeeding floor prevents raveling of earth and consequent breaking of the\r\nslab, as well as the harboring of rats]\r\n\r\nPortable laying and brooder houses frequently become heavily infested\r\nbecause they are usually built with wooden floors removed from the\r\nground only by the height of the runners on which they are constructed\r\nand are seldom moved as frequently as originally intended. Feed,\r\nsifting through the floors, attracts rats, which after finding\r\ndesirable shelter soon establish themselves in burrows beneath the\r\nhouses and multiply rapidly. Portable houses, therefore, should be\r\nraised off the ground 2 or more feet.\r\n\r\nNests should be raised 2 or more feet above the floor, and feed and\r\ngrit hoppers at least 1 foot. Drinking vessels for water and skim milk\r\nshould supported on a platform 1 to 1½ feet above the floor, so as\r\nto eliminate the possibility of rat shelters and keep the liquids in\r\na more sanitary condition. Other equipment should be given the same\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe premises around the poultry house should be cleared of all rat\r\nharbors by elevating all objects under which a rat can find shelter.\r\n(Fig. 14.) Near-by buildings particularly should be considered, for it\r\nis frequently found that rats living exclusively on poultry feed occupy\r\nharbors 50 or more feet away from the food source. For this, reason\r\nit is desirable to build poultry plants at least 100 feet from any\r\npossible rat harborage. The vast number of young chicks killed annually\r\nby rats would be greatly reduced if these simple precautions were taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13740C\r\n\r\nFigure 13.--Rat proofing a poultry house by laying a concrete floor]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER FARM STRUCTURES\r\n\r\nThere are many farm buildings of various kinds that should be made\r\nproof against rats. In most cases, however, the application of the\r\ngeneral principles of rat proofing, as previously explained, will\r\nsuffice. Not only should all buildings in which food is kept be made\r\ninaccessible to rats, but adjoining and near-by buildings and premises\r\nas well. The procedure to be followed in the case of farm dwellings is\r\nomitted here, as sufficient is included under the next heading, Rat\r\nProofing City Buildings, the conditions with respect to dwellings on\r\nfarms and in towns being quite similar.\r\n\r\nOutside cellars frequently become infested with rats, and great havoc\r\nto stored produce almost invariably results. Considerable expense,\r\nif necessary, is justified in making the storage cellar rat proof. A\r\ncellarway with wooden steps and sills and earth floor is usually the\r\nsource of the trouble. The sill soon rots or the rats burrow under\r\nit to gain entrance. The remedy is to construct a concrete floor\r\nand cellarway. This not only will exclude rats but will prove more\r\neconomical in the long run. (Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7651-C\r\n\r\nFigure 14.--Coop built up off the ground, rather than with the floor\r\nresting on the ground and thereby affording rats a desirable hiding\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--A, Cellarway before rat proofing; B,\r\ncellarway rat proofed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAT PROOFING CITY BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn rat proofing a city building it is well first to look to the\r\nexterior. If the locality is heavily infested with rats, some\r\nare almost certain sooner or later to find their way into the\r\nbuilding however well protected against them it may be. Garbage\r\nand trash usually comprise the bulk of the rats' food supply. A\r\nmetal, water-tight garbage can, large enough to contain all garbage\r\naccumulations between collections and having a close-fitting lid (fig\r\n1), is of prime importance and should be required in all cases by city\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B2008M\r\n\r\nFigure 16.--An accumulation of trash such as this Is almost certain to\r\nattract rats and should be prohibited by law]\r\n\r\nLarge accumulations of trash usually, contain much waste food (fig.\r\n16) and are certain to attract rats and furnish an ideal breeding\r\nplace for them. Furthermore, they are a menace to health and should\r\nnot be tolerated under any circumstances. All other rat harbors,\r\nsuch as wooden floors and sidewalks very near the ground, should be\r\nremoved or replaced with concrete, and piles of lumber and various\r\nmaterials stored out of doors should be removed or elevated 18 or more\r\ninches. Particular care should be taken to see that sheds and other\r\noutbuildings, porches, steps, loading platforms, and similar structures\r\non the premises are made rat proof, either by the use of concrete, by\r\nelevation, or by keeping them open to the light and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nA thorough inspection should next be made of the building itself and\r\ncareful note taken of alterations and repairs necessary for a thorough\r\njob of rat proofing. Inspection should begin in the basement. Doors\r\nand windows should fit snugly, particularly doors leading to outside\r\nstairs or elevators, and these should also be provided with automatic\r\nclosing devices. Windows and ventilators should be screened or covered\r\nwith gratings, the openings not more than half an inch square. Defects\r\nin basement floors should be repaired with concrete, and floor drains\r\nshould be fitted with tight covers, (Fig. 17.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B3341M:B3331M\r\n\r\nFigure 17.--A, Broken floor drains provide a ready means for invasion\r\nby rats; B, rat tracks in freshly laid concrete around newly repaired\r\ndrain show that before repairs were made the drain was a rat highway]\r\n\r\nSide walls should be carefully inspected, and all openings made for\r\nplumbing (fig. 18), electric-wire conduits, areas around windows and\r\ndoors, and unpointed joints in masonry walls (frequently left when\r\nthe exterior of the wall is hidden from public view by porches or\r\nplatforms) should be carefully closed with cement mortar. (Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B28391:B4391M\r\n\r\nFigure 18.--A, Openings around pipes are a common source of rat\r\ninfestation; B, situations like this give rats access to otherwise\r\nrat-proof buildings]\r\n\r\nBasement ceilings, when accessible to rats, cause much trouble, and\r\nfrequently the best remedy is to remove them entirely. In frame\r\nconstruction spaces between studs in walls opening into basements\r\nalso are a common cause of rat infestation of the whole building. The\r\npermanent closing of these spaces with noncombustible material not\r\nonly shuts out the rats but also reduces the fire hazard by stopping\r\nthe drafts and the rising of heated gases should a fire start in the\r\nbasement. This process of blocking spaces between studs and furring\r\nis commonly known as fire stopping and is of such importance that\r\nthe building regulations of many cities now require it. Figure 20\r\nillustrates practical methods of rat proofing stud spaces in old\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B4388M\r\n\r\nFigure 19.--Defects in foundations, such as the opening to the right of\r\nthe step, are often the cause of rat infestation in old buildings]\r\n\r\nAll openings between floors and in partitions made for the passage of\r\npipes and wires and any defects in the wall should be closed with metal\r\nflashing. All dead spaces throughout the building, such as boxed-in\r\nplumbing, spaces behind or beneath built-in cabinets, counters,\r\nshelving, bins, show windows, and many similar places, should be\r\nremoved, opened up, or effectively and permanently proofed against rats.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States, where the roof rat occurs, similar care must\r\nbe taken to make the upper floors and roofs of buildings rat proof, as\r\nthis rat is an expert climber and frequently enters buildings by way of\r\nthe roof. Doors at the top of stairs and elevators should fit snugly,\r\nand all ventilators, exhaust fans, unused chimney flues, and other\r\nopenings should be screened. Broken skylights and openings under eaves\r\nand places where electric wires enter the building should be repaired\r\nor closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--Methods of rat proofing stud spaces in old\r\nbuildings: A, Construction at outer wall. Open stud spaces are filled\r\nwith weak concrete, which is placed by removing the skirting above. If\r\nthe work is done a little at a time, the wooden forms can be removed\r\nwhen the concrete has set, and used again. B, Another method employing\r\nsheet metal secured to sill, joist, and flooring. C, Post and girder in\r\nbasement supporting partition with open stud spaces. Sheet metal nailed\r\nto joists and floor and fitted about the stud prevents access to upper\r\nfloors]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--A, Typical construction of frame building on\r\nwooden girders and posts with Joists more than 2 feet above ground; B,\r\nsheet metal placed as shown serves to prevent the rats from climbing to\r\na point where they can gnaw through the wood]\r\n\r\nBuildings that have neither basements nor continuous masonry\r\nfoundations present more difficult rat-proofing problems. The most\r\neffective procedure is to construct a concrete foundation wall between\r\nthe existing supports and, after the wall has hardened, remove the\r\nsupports, if of wood, and replace them with concrete to make the wall\r\ncontinuous. Where the cost prohibits following this plan and where\r\nthe supporting sill and joists are at least 2 feet above the ground\r\nlevel, satisfactory rat proofing may be attained by stopping the\r\nspaces between the studs with weak concrete or other material resistant\r\nto rats for a distance of 8 inches above the floor level, or with\r\ngalvanized-metal flashing nailed to the joists, plate, and floor. (Fig.\r\n21.) The space beneath the building must be free from all rubbish and\r\nother material that would afford shelter for rats. A continuous masonry\r\nfoundation, with screened openings to provide ventilation, presents a\r\nmore pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--A, Concrete curtain, or area wall, designed\r\nfor rat-proofing purposes; it does not support the building. B, Plan\r\nof wall where supports are of wood; the concrete is bound to the posts\r\nwith wire mesh. C, Plan of masonry support; concrete will adhere to the\r\nmasonry if the surface is roughened]\r\n\r\nIf the clearance between the ground level and the bottom of girders\r\nand joists is less than 2 feet, it may provide a hazardous rat harbor.\r\nOne of three things should be done: The building should be elevated on\r\npiers 2 feet above the ground; a concrete foundation should be built\r\nas described above; or a continuous concrete curtain wall should be\r\nconstructed under the entire outer wall of the building. (Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\nMost new city buildings are now built practically rat proof, or could\r\nbe made so with only minor changes in the plans and at small cost. Yet\r\nif certain essential details are not included at the start, endless rat\r\ntroubles are likely to ensue. It is therefore highly desirable that\r\nplans for every new building include specifications for rat proofing.\r\n\r\nAll new buildings in which foodstuffs are to be handled should have\r\nground floors of concrete or other rat-proof material and concrete or\r\nmasonry walls extending at least 2 feet below and 1 foot above the\r\nground surface. All unnecessary openings in the foundation, walls,\r\nand floors should be permanently closed, and windows and ventilators\r\nshould be screened. Stud spaces in frame construction should be stopped\r\nwith noncombustible material resistant to rats. New buildings in which\r\nfoodstuffs are not to be handled may, if desired, be elevated on piers\r\nor posts to provide a clearance of 2 feet between the ground level and\r\nthe bottom of the supporting girders, although the concrete or masonry\r\nwall is more satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETS\r\n\r\nPublic, farmers', and wholesale markets, commission houses, and\r\nsimilar places where vast quantities of foodstuffs are assembled and\r\nredistributed are nearly always infested with large numbers of rats.\r\nSuch structures are usually concentrated in districts, and these often\r\nbecome rat-breeding centers, from which the rats constantly overflow to\r\nadjoining sections of the city. Rat proofing a district of this kind\r\nwould seem to be almost hopeless, yet it has often been demonstrated\r\nthat the task is not only feasible but entirely practicable. . Here,\r\nmore than anywhere else, the great need is the elimination of rat\r\nshelters, which in turn means the free use of concrete or other\r\nmasonry. Scrupulous cleanliness is essential in markets, but even where\r\nthis is practiced it is not possible completely to eliminate rat food,\r\nso the main reliance must be placed on the removal of all rat harbors.\r\nNot only must the building in which the market is housed be rat\r\nproofed, but also all the fixtures. In old public markets the stalls\r\nwere frequently constructed as if designed for the protection of rats.\r\nDark, out-of-the-way holes under counters, stands, and shelves afford\r\nconvenient places for the accumulation of trash, which it would be well\r\nto destroy; and in such locations, with abundance of food at hand,\r\nrats are in the best possible position to thrive and multiply. The\r\nuse of smooth concrete or tile counters (fig. 23) erected on concrete\r\nfloors deprive rats of the essential shelter, provided that the space\r\nunderneath the counter is kept clean and that stored material is moved\r\nfrequently. The smooth surface also prevents the rats from climbing and\r\nmakes it possible to leave edible products on the counter overnight\r\nwithout fear of their being damaged or contaminated by the rodents. If\r\nwooden floors are used, the boards should be laid flat on the concrete\r\nor on sleepers not more than half an inch high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B3137BM\r\n\r\nFigure 23.--Rat proof market stalls. Rats are unable to climb the\r\nsmooth tiles to get at foodstuffs left on the counter]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAREHOUSES\r\n\r\nWarehouses require rat proofing because of the great quantities of\r\nfoodstuffs handled there and even stored for long periods. It is\r\nessential that the building itself be rat proofed with concrete or\r\nmasonry foundation, concrete floors, and tight-fitting doors lined with\r\nmetal at the base. Doors of warehouses frequently become jammed as a\r\nresult of heavy trucking and should be carefully watched for defects\r\nthat would admit rats. Concrete floors, in addition to being rat proof\r\nand fire proof, save labor because of the comparative ease with which\r\nloaded trucks can be rolled over them.\r\n\r\nWhen warehouses are found to be seriously infested with rats, the\r\ntrouble can usually be traced to such faulty construction as allows the\r\nrats access to spaces beneath floors or within walls, or even provides\r\nexits to near-by shelter outside.\r\n\r\nEats also gain entrance to rat-proofed warehouses through being shipped\r\nin with produce or when doors are left open, and once inside they may\r\npersist and do much damage from shelter afforded by piles of stored\r\ngoods. Such damage, however, is usually small in comparison with that\r\nresulting from permanent rat harbors beneath floors, and the rats\r\ncan be destroyed much more easily. A report from one flour warehouse\r\nindicated that it cost more than $3,000 a year to repair bags gnawed\r\nby rats and mice. Such a loss would go far toward rat proofing any\r\npremises. A common cause of rat depredations in warehouses is the\r\nconstruction of platforms a few inches off the floor upon which to pile\r\nflour and other produce. Such platforms provide permanent shelter for\r\nrats and should be eliminated. Boards may be laid flat on the concrete\r\nfloor with no spaces between them to afford rat harbors; or, if this is\r\nnot sufficient proof against dampness, the platforms should be raised\r\na foot or more off the floor to admit light. In such a place a rat\r\ndoes not feel safe and will not stay. Bags of flour, grain, and other\r\nproduce furnish harborage that can not well be avoided, but such goods\r\nare usually moved so frequently that rats do not have opportunity to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAT PROOFING THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nRat proofing the city is a responsibility of the city government.\r\nThe greatest force that can be exerted to-day toward the permanent\r\nsuppression of the rat pest is through the passage of practical\r\nbuilding ordinances that require the rat proofing of buildings and the\r\nadoption of sanitary regulations that will insure clean premises and\r\nadequate collection and disposed of garbage. It has been demonstrated\r\nthat such requirements not only are effective in reducing the numbers\r\nof rats to the minimum, but also that they greatly improve health\r\nconditions, reduce the fire hazard, and from a purely economic\r\nstandpoint are profitable. In one city in which rat proofing has been\r\nvigorously prosecuted for a number of years and in which more than 80\r\nper cent of the old buildings have been made proof against rats, the\r\nsharp decline in the number of fires resulted in a 5 per cent reduction\r\nin the fire-insurance rates. More than $1,000,000 was spent in the same\r\ncity in rat proofing 10 miles of docks, but even this large expenditure\r\nwas found to be a profitable investment.\r\n\r\nProbably nothing so nearly reflects the sanitary conditions of a city\r\nas the number of rats that it harbors, for the rat population is\r\nusually in inverse ratio to the degree of sanitation maintained. In\r\n1930 at least 13 cities in this country had rat-proofing laws, and more\r\nthan 30 others had fire-stopping requirements that are important in rat\r\nproofing.\r\n\r\nAn effective rat-proofing program must be practicable and not too\r\ndrastic; otherwise it will fail from lack of popular support. Attempts\r\nto enforce rat proofing of existing structures would probably not be\r\nfeasible unless under stress of an outbreak of bubonic plague or other\r\nrat-borne disease epidemic. There seems to be no good reason, however,\r\nwhy buildings constructed in the future or remodeled should not be\r\nmade rat proof under the requirements of building ordinances. Had such\r\nordinances been enacted 50 years ago and rigidly enforced since that\r\ntime the large majority of buildings to-day would be rat proof, and\r\nrats, with their accompanying filth and destructiveness, would have\r\nbeen largely eliminated. There would also be fewer of the unsightly\r\nand insanitary shacks now existing in most cities, and the average\r\nstructure would be of a more desirable type. As modern construction\r\nconforms so closely in principle to the requirements of rat proofing,\r\nthere should be little, if any, opposition among builders to a\r\nrat-proofing clause in building ordinances.\r\n\r\nIn considering the suppression of rats, at the outset city authorities\r\nshould discard all methods other than those that strike at the source\r\nof the trouble. The actual destruction of rats is necessary as a\r\ntemporary means of stopping their depredations, but modern construction\r\nand sanitation are the weapons that must be relied upon to gain\r\npermanent relief. In addition to a rat-proofing ordinance, every city\r\nshould have a law requiring that all garbage wherever accumulated be\r\nkept in rat-proof containers or garbage cans until collected or until\r\ndestroyed by incineration or otherwise disposed of in a manner that\r\nwould avoid the possibility of its providing food for rats. Containers\r\nshould have covers not easily removed by dogs and other animals.\r\nThe city should also enact regulations prohibiting the accumulation\r\nof trash, refuse, or waste matter of any kind on either public or\r\nprivate premises, and should provide adequate means for collecting and\r\ndisposing of all waste.\r\n\r\nConsideration should also be given to the sewer system. Although most\r\nmodern sewers do not offer opportunity for the unrestricted breeding\r\nof rats, there are many still in use that furnish harbors for large\r\nnumbers of these pests in sections of some cities. Of most importance\r\nis the corner catch basin, storm sewer, or street-drainage opening,\r\nwhich should be effectively remodeled, if necessary, to provide smooth\r\ninterior vertical walls with a drop of at least 3 feet; rats are unable\r\nto jump 3 feet vertically or to climb smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\nAnother place that should receive attention is the city dumping ground,\r\nwhich frequently serves as an incubator for rats, and these soon\r\noverflow into near-by sections of the city. A study should be made of\r\nmethods of disposing of waste materials and a system put into effect\r\nthat will meet the requirements of the city and insure the destruction,\r\nremoval, or adequate covering of all such food for rats. Any other\r\nconditions that may be found favorable for the breeding of rats,\r\nwhether on public or on private property, should be declared a public\r\nnuisance and ordered corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODEL RAT-PROOFING ORDINANCES\r\n\r\nThe samples or models of rat-proofing and garbage-removal ordinances\r\nhere given were prepared by the United States Public Health Service\r\nas a result of its experience in combating bubonic plague in several\r\ncoastal cities. They have, in substance, been adopted and put into\r\npractice by a number of cities and have been found practicable.\r\nThey should be applicable to any city after necessary allowance and\r\npossible changes have been made to conform to local conditions and\r\nconstitutional considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ORDINANCE DEFINING RAT PROOFING OF ALL BUILDINGS[3]\r\n\r\n[3] U. S. Pub. Health Serv. Bul. 121, Preliminary Report on Proposed\r\nAntiplague Measures in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n  Section 1. _Be it ordained, etc._, That it shall be unlawful for any\r\n  person, firm, or corporation hereafter to construct any building,\r\n  outhouse, or other superstructure, stable, lot, open area, or other\r\n  premise, sidewalk, street, or alley, or to repair or remodel the same\r\n  to an extent of -------- per cent of cost of construction within the\r\n  city of --------, unless the same shall be rat proofed in the manner\r\n  hereinafter provided for.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. _Be it further ordained, etc._, That for the purpose of rat\r\n  proofing all buildings, outhouses, and other superstructures in the\r\n  city of --------, except stables, shall be divided into two classes,\r\n  to wit, class A and class B, and the same shall be rat proofed in the\r\n  manner following, to wit:\r\n\r\n  _Class A._--All buildings, outhouses, and other superstructures of\r\n  class A shall have floors made of rat-proof material or of concrete,\r\n  which concrete shall be not less than 3 inches thick, and overlaid\r\n  with a top dressing of cement, mosaic, tiling, or other impermeable\r\n  material laid in cement mortar, and such floor shall rest without\r\n  any intervening space between upon the ground or upon filling of\r\n  clean earth, sand, cinders, broken stone or brick, gravel, or similar\r\n  material, which filling shall be free from animal or vegetable\r\n  substances; said floor shall extend and be hermetically sealed to\r\n  walls surrounding said floor, which walls shall be made of rat-proof\r\n  material or of concrete, stone, or brick laid in cement or mortar,\r\n  and each wall shall be not less than 6 inches thick and shall extend\r\n  into and below the surface of the surrounding ground at least 2 feet\r\n  and shall extend not less than 1 foot above the surface of said\r\n  floor; provided that wooden removable gratings may be laid on such\r\n  concrete floors in such parts of such buildings, superstructures,\r\n  and outhouses as are used exclusively as sales departments, provided\r\n  that wooden flooring may be laid over the concrete wherever the\r\n  intervening space between such flooring and the concrete shall not\r\n  exceed one-half inch; provided further that any sleepers that are\r\n  sunk into the concrete shall be creosoted.\r\n\r\n  _Class B._--All accidental and unnecessary spaces and holes,\r\n  ventilators, and other openings other than doors and windows in every\r\n  building, outhouse or other superstructure in the city of --------,\r\n  shall be closed with cement, mortar, or other material impervious to\r\n  rats or screened with wire having not more than one-half inch mesh,\r\n  as the case may require, and all wall spaces shall be closed with\r\n  cement, mortar, or other material impervious to rats, which closure\r\n  shall extend the full thickness of the wall and shall extend upward\r\n  at least twelve inches above the floor level, and the whole in such\r\n  manner as to prevent the ingress or egress of rats; or the ingress\r\n  or egress of rats from such double wall or space may be prevented by\r\n  protecting the junction of said wall with the floor or other wall\r\n  with metal flashing of galvanized iron of 28 or 30 gauge, provided\r\n  that where such double wall is open beneath or is in communication\r\n  with foundations of the house that said opening shall be effectively\r\n  closed or said junction with foundations flashed with metal as\r\n  provided above: _Provided_, That in all buildings, outhouses, and\r\n  other superstructures of class A and in all stables where there are\r\n  any spaces in walls between the wall proper and the covering on\r\n  same, or in ceilings between the ceiling and floor, or other ceiling\r\n  covering above, said spaces shall be eliminated by the removal of\r\n  said covering, or so closed with cement, mortar or other material\r\n  impervious to rats as to prevent the ingress or egress of rats:\r\n  _Provided_, That all such wall spaces shall be closed with cement,\r\n  mortar, or other material impervious to rats, which closure shall\r\n  extend the full thickness of the wall and shall extend upward at\r\n  least twelve inches above the floor level.\r\n\r\n  The cellar of every building hereafter erected within the building\r\n  limits shall be made rat proof by the use of masonry or metal.
