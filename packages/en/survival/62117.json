COOPER\r\n\r\nIn the course of its general investigations of the water powers\r\nof the State, the Water Supply Commission has heretofore confined\r\nits attention to the possibilities for large developments, and the\r\nregulation of the flow of rivers and large creeks. No previous or\r\ngeneral investigation of small creeks and brooks and their power\r\npossibilities has been made, not because they were considered\r\nunimportant, but because the Commission believes that if the State\r\ndecides to take an active part in the regulation of the flow of streams\r\nand the development and conservation of water powers, it should\r\nconfine its first activities to the larger units, leaving the smaller\r\nopportunities for later examination and for private and individual\r\ndevelopment. However, no comprehensive system of conservation can meet\r\nwith universal favor unless it contemplates the prevention of waste,\r\ngreat or small, and wherever found.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Commission desires to call attention to the\r\nvaluable power which is now running to waste in thousands of small\r\ncreeks and brooks in all sections of the State. Many of these minor\r\nstreams present possibilities for small individual developments of\r\npower sufficient to supply all the requirements of the owner at a\r\ncomparatively small cost. Numerous farms in the State have on them\r\nbrooks or creeks capable of supplying power sufficient to furnish\r\nelectric light for all the buildings. Others would also furnish power\r\nenough to drive a feed grinder, a churn or cream separator, or to run a\r\nwood saw, sewing machine or other machines and implements requiring a\r\nsmall amount of power for their operation. In short, there are numerous\r\nsmall streams now tumbling over ledges in barnyards or pastures whose\r\nwasted energy might readily be transformed and applied to useful work\r\nby the installation of small and inexpensive water-power plants. If the\r\npower of more of these were developed and substituted for manual labor,\r\na great saving of time and energy would be accomplished, and financial\r\nprofit would result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Application of Hydro-electric Power Vacuum\r\nMilking Machines]\r\n\r\nAfter the initial expense of installing the plant is paid, the cost\r\nof a small water power is inconsiderable, the plant requiring little\r\npersonal attention and small expense for supplies and repairs. However,\r\nwhile the power of some streams may be developed at an amazingly\r\nsmall cost, in other instances the cost may be prohibitive. In this\r\nconnection, one fact that is perhaps not fully appreciated is that\r\nthe power of a waterfall is comparatively permanent, only its rate of\r\navailability being limited. While the stream may shrink in the dry\r\nsummer and fall, it is quite certain to swell again in the spring and\r\nto continue the process, year after year, as the source of supply is\r\ncontinually renewed. But the power which might have been, but was not\r\ndeveloped in the year 1910, cannot be reclaimed in 1911 or ever after.\r\nMuch of the power that is wasted by inequality of the flow of the\r\nstream may be saved by conservation through water storage; but this\r\nsometimes involves a large outlay and therefore, generally speaking,\r\nthe fullest use of the power of a small stream can best be obtained by\r\nusing the stream as it runs, or at best after temporary storage behind\r\ninexpensive dams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Luminous” Electric Radiator]\r\n\r\nThe Water Supply Commission believes that the possibilities for small\r\nwater powers should be pointed out to the people of the State in order\r\nthat there may be a better realization of the usefulness and value of\r\nthis remarkable natural resource and that the farmers and residents of\r\nrural districts may take advantage of the opportunities to conserve and\r\nutilize them. It is believed that some facts relating to the utility\r\nof power in general and small water powers in particular, together\r\nwith descriptions of some typical small water-power developments\r\nthat are now in actual operation, and brief notes as to how such a\r\npower may be developed and applied, will suffice to bring the subject\r\nforcibly to the attention of those most interested, and furnish at\r\nleast a beginning for observations in this comparatively new field,\r\nand stimulate a tendency to a more general utilization of this source\r\nof power, and a consequent saving of much energy now secured from\r\ncoal, wood and other exhaustible producers of power. Accordingly, the\r\nfollowing discussion of the many and varied uses for power on the\r\nmodern farm, together with descriptions of developments now in use, and\r\nnotes on developing a small water power, are submitted in the hope that\r\nthey may be of interest and service to those who have chosen farming\r\nfor their livelihood or pleasure, especially by assisting them in the\r\nconsideration as to whether or not it may be worth while to develop the\r\npower of any particular stream. These discussions and descriptions are\r\nnot intended to suffice as a practical handbook for laying out a power\r\nplant, but merely to point the way to an intelligent consideration of\r\nthe possibilities, by showing what others have done and laying down\r\na few fundamental principles, which should properly be taken into\r\nconsideration in determining upon the development of a small water\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES FOR POWER ON THE FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of securing a sufficient number of capable and\r\nsatisfactory farm hands in these days, when the majority of young men\r\nare turning to the populous centers for their livelihood, is perhaps\r\nthe most compelling reason why machines which can be substituted for\r\nmanual labor are a decided advantage to the up-to-date farmer. Their\r\nadoption as a part of the permanent equipment for the farm should\r\nrender their owner comparatively independent of some of the problems of\r\nsupply and demand for farm labor, the solution of which problems is\r\nan important factor in determining the success or failure of the\r\nfarmer who disposes of his produce in open market. This condition is\r\nsupplemented by a commendable tendency for farmers to live better, to\r\nplace the home life of the farm on a higher plane, and to make farming\r\na means of pleasurable livelihood rather than the mere eking out of\r\na bare subsistence from the products of the soil. These conditions,\r\ntogether with the greatly improved quality of illumination and\r\nconvenience which electricity affords, are creating a growing demand\r\nfor a reliable and reasonably economical source of energy with which to\r\nsupply both light and power on the larger estates and farms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor Lifting a Ton of Hay, Hydro-electric Power]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Toaster]\r\n\r\nThat electric light is much cleaner and more convenient than kerosene\r\nlamps must, of course, be admitted by all. It must also be admitted\r\nthat a kerosene lamp of any considerable illuminating power has also\r\ncertain heating propensities which render it an unpleasant companion\r\non a warm summer evening. However, when it comes to a consideration\r\nof mere dollars and cents, there seems to be a widespread belief that\r\nkerosene as a source of illumination is cheaper than electricity.\r\nStatements to this effect are too often allowed to go uncontradicted,\r\nand too many people accept this view without taking the trouble to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively simple matter to compare the cost of the two\r\nkinds of light, knowing as we do exactly how much current an electric\r\nlamp of a certain filament and candle-power will consume. Such a\r\ncomparison will frequently result in a choice of electricity as the\r\ncheaper light. In many cases the selection of electricity to supplant\r\nkerosene lamps would result in no considerable saving of money, but\r\nwould do away with considerable inconvenience and furnish much better\r\nillumination. If cost is the controlling consideration, the comparison\r\ncannot always be so much in favor of electricity. An important\r\nconsideration, often overlooked, is that with electric lights the\r\ninteriors of living rooms do not require such frequent repapering or\r\nrefinishing as they would require with kerosene illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-driven Sewing Machine]\r\n\r\nHowever, the convenience and cleanliness of electricity are fairly well\r\nknown and appreciated, but the means by which electric currents may be\r\ngenerated economically, and by which this form of energy may be applied\r\nto bring about sufficient returns, financial and otherwise, to warrant\r\nthe installation of an isolated plant for a farm or country home, are\r\nnot so generally understood.\r\n\r\nElectric current may be generated by means of a dynamo, or generator,\r\nwith any kind of a power-producing plant. All that the dynamo requires\r\nto enable it to produce electric current is power of some kind that\r\nmay be applied in such manner and quantity as will cause the armature,\r\nor “interior core,” of the machine to rotate at a sufficiently high\r\nand uniform rate of speed. There are various kinds of power generators\r\nwhich will perform this work satisfactorily for isolated plants. Within\r\nthe last few years the small internal combustion engine, supplemented\r\nby the electric storage battery, for stationary service, have been so\r\nmuch improved and simplified as to cause them to compare very favorably\r\nwith the better-known types of power-producing apparatus in first cost\r\nand in reliability of operation. The extreme simplicity of both this\r\ntype of engine and of the storage battery, together with the great\r\neconomy in fuel consumption of these engines, the low price of fuel,\r\nand the efficiency of the battery as a device for storing the energy\r\nand delivering it in the form of electric current when needed and in\r\nthe quantity required, result in a low operating cost. The advent of\r\ntax-free alcohol into the field of available fuels for use in internal\r\ncombustion engines, and the growing demand for this class of fuel,\r\nindicate that it will become, in time, a strong competitor of kerosene\r\nand gasolene. At present, gasolene is the fuel most generally used for\r\nengines of this type and small-size gas engines are now manufactured by\r\nmany firms.\r\n\r\nSteam power is probably the best understood of all classes of power. In\r\nmany cases, especially where the fuel is very cheap, this is the best\r\npower for a farmer to have. Steam-power plants, as well as gasolene,\r\nkerosene and alcohol plants, all require personal attendance during\r\noperation and necessitate more or less frequent applications of fuel.\r\nWind power is also a source of energy which may well be considered by\r\nthe farmer who needs a small amount of power.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most promising source of power for farmers in New York\r\nState is the power that may be developed from falling water. This kind\r\nof a power plant requires comparatively little personal attention\r\nwhile in operation, and needs no replenishing of fuel except such as\r\nNature herself provides in the flowing brook. Not only are there many\r\nof these powers that are undeveloped as yet, but there are many others\r\nwhich have been developed at some previous time and have recently been\r\nallowed to fall into disuse for various reasons. Many old sawmills were\r\nabandoned when the surrounding hills were all lumbered off. A small\r\ninvestment would enable many such old powers to be revived and applied\r\nto some useful purpose. Such a water-power plant could frequently be\r\nmade to serve the owner or a group of users of electric current at very\r\nsmall first cost for each individual, and at an operating cost which\r\nwould be inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that much depends on the choice of\r\nthe best power for any particular purpose, and a careful consideration\r\nof what is needed, and the conditions under which the power must be\r\nsupplied, is essential to insure satisfaction with a power plant.\r\nIn any particular instance a manufacturer of small waterwheels will\r\ncheerfully submit an estimate for a water-power plant, while the\r\nmakers of steam and gasolene engines will quite as readily furnish any\r\ninformation to be based on data furnished by the intending purchaser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-driven Ice Cream Freezer]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the applications of power to practical purposes on the\r\nfarm is very broad. While perhaps electric lighting is the use most\r\nfrequently thought of, it is, however, in the application of electric\r\ncurrent or power to the operation of labor-saving devices that the\r\ngreatest gain is to be derived on the large farm or country place. Feed\r\ngrinders, root cutters, fodder cutters, fanning mills, grindstones,\r\ncircular saws, corn shellers, drill presses, ensilage cutters and\r\nelevators, horse clippers, milking machines, grain separators,\r\nthreshing machines, cream separators, churns, vacuum cleaners,\r\nice cream freezers, dough mixers, feed mixers, chicken hatchers,\r\nand numerous other machines and implements operated by power, are\r\nobtainable in these days of labor-saving devices. The amount of power\r\nrequired to operate many of these is small. The presence of a plant of\r\nsufficient capacity to operate one or two particular machines often\r\nmakes it possible to use the power for many of the other purposes.\r\nThe amount of work that a small power will do may be judged from the\r\nfollowing brief statements of what is actually being done:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-driven Cream Separator\r\n\r\nNote small size of motor]\r\n\r\nSix horsepower will drive a grain separator and thresh 2500 bushels of\r\noats in ten hours.\r\n\r\nThree horsepower furnishes all power needed to make 6000 pounds of milk\r\ninto cheese in one day.\r\n\r\nSix horsepower will run a feed mill grinding twenty bushels of corn an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFive horsepower grinds twenty-five to forty bushels of feed, or ten to\r\ntwelve bushels of ear corn, an hour.\r\n\r\nSeven horsepower drives an eighteen-inch separator, burr mill and corn\r\nand cob crusher and corn sheller, grinding from twelve to fifteen\r\nbushels of feed an hour, and five to eight bushels of good, fine meal.\r\n\r\nSix horsepower runs a heavy apple grater, grinding and pressing 200 to\r\n250 bushels of apples an hour.\r\n\r\nFive horsepower will drive a thirty-inch circular saw, sawing from\r\nfifty to seventy-five cords of stovewood from hard oak in ten hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Ironing]\r\n\r\nSix horsepower saws all the wood four men can pile in cords.\r\n\r\nTwelve horsepower will drive a fifty-inch circular saw, sawing 4000\r\nfeet of oak, or 5000 feet of poplar, in a day.\r\n\r\nTen horsepower will run a sixteen-inch ensilage cutter and blower, and\r\nelevate the ensilage into a silo thirty feet high at the rate of seven\r\ntons per hour.\r\n\r\nOne horsepower will pump water from a well of ordinary depth in\r\nsufficient quantity to supply an ordinary farmhouse and all the\r\nbuildings with water for all the ordinary uses.\r\n\r\nIn determining the size of power plant required in any particular\r\ninstance the use requiring the largest amount of power must be\r\nconsidered. It follows that there will then be plenty of power for the\r\nsmaller requirements. In considering a water power it should also be\r\nborne in mind that the full theoretical amount of a water power can\r\nnever be realized, a certain portion being taken up in friction in the\r\nwaterwheel and in losses in the electric generator, transmission lines,\r\nmotors, etc. The question as to how much may be made available will be\r\ndiscussed hereinafter.\r\n\r\nFollowing are descriptions of some typical water-power developments in\r\nuse in this State at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM WATER-POWER DEVELOPMENT IN ONEIDA COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Hot Plate]\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the village of Oriskany Falls, in Oneida county,\r\nN. Y., is a farm of about 100 acres, belonging to Mr. E. Burdette\r\nMiner. This community was at one time one of the principal hop-raising\r\ndistricts of the State. Mr. Miner has been engaged in raising hops for\r\nfifty years, and raised 10,000 pounds of hops on seven acres the past\r\nseason. In recent years he has divided his attention between mixed\r\nfarming and dairying, keeping from twenty to twenty-five cows.\r\n\r\nBefore the installation of his water power, not the least of the\r\nirksome tasks about the farmhouse was the daily filling and cleaning\r\nof kerosene lamps and lanterns; and the wood was sawed, and the cream\r\nseparator and churn in the dairy room were operated, by hand. Five sons\r\ncontributed in no small measure to the prompt disposal of the daily\r\ntasks. But the boys went forth into the world and acquired lines of\r\nactivity and interest of their own. Only the oldest son remained to\r\nlive on the farm. Another son studied electrical engineering, a third\r\nchose mechanical pursuits, a fourth became a civil engineer, and a\r\nfifth took up commercial work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Coffee Percolator]\r\n\r\nAfter coming in touch with the outer world and the great modern\r\nachievements of science and invention, especially of a mechanical or\r\nengineering character, the boys quite naturally set their wits to work\r\nto devise some way in which the daily labors of those at home might be\r\nmade less burdensome.\r\n\r\nThrough the farm flows Oriskany creek, which ripples over its gravelly\r\nbed in a channel from twenty to thirty feet wide. The boys said to\r\ntheir father, “Why not harness the creek and make it do some of the\r\nwork?” There was no precipitous fall of the creek on the farm, but\r\nthe boys proposed to concentrate at least a portion of the fall by\r\nconstructing a dam. This they intended to do primarily for the purpose\r\nof developing enough power to light the homestead and farm buildings\r\nwith electricity and to saw the wood and do away with some of the other\r\ntiresome farm tasks.\r\n\r\nThe elder Miner was not enthusiastic at first, but was finally\r\npersuaded by the boys, who made surveys and plans for a water-power\r\ndevelopment, and in October, 1905, with the assistance of three of his\r\nboys and two day laborers, Mr. Miner began the construction of a dam\r\nacross the creek. This was to be no ordinary structure. The creek,\r\nwhile peaceful enough at most times, had a habit, well known to Mr.\r\nMiner, of bursting its bounds every spring and rushing through the farm\r\nin a torrent. So the dam was built in such a way that, while it would\r\nraise the water to a certain height during periods of ordinary flow, it\r\nwould not cause the floods to rise perceptibly higher than before the\r\ndam was built. Accordingly, it was designed so that a part of it could\r\nbe lowered at flood times to allow free passage for the swollen stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dam of E. B. Miner, Oriskany Falls, N. Y.\r\n\r\nMain dam at left; flood spillway at right]\r\n\r\nThe bed of the stream at the site selected for the dam is composed of\r\nsolidly packed gravel. It was not considered advisable to lay timbers\r\non such a foundation, so a ditch about two feet deep and one and\r\none-half feet wide was dug across the creek bed and filled with\r\nconcrete, to which a heavy timber was securely bolted, to form the\r\nupstream sill for the super-structure. The downstream side was\r\nsupported on a sill of heavy timber whose ends were embedded in the\r\nconcrete walls, or abutments, at either end of the dam and whose middle\r\nportion was supported by posts, spaced six feet apart, which in turn\r\nrested on large blocks of concrete placed in the bed of the creek.\r\nThis downstream sill was about two and one-half feet higher than the\r\nupstream sill. A horizontal floor of double plank extending twelve\r\nfeet downstream from the upstream sill and supported by the concrete\r\nfoundations under the downstream sill formed an apron for the water to\r\nfall on. This prevents back-washing under the dam. A double layer of\r\nheavy plank was then fastened on the two sills, forming a sloping face\r\non the water side of the dam. On the upper edge of this plank-facing,\r\nat the crest of the dam, are placed flashboards, one foot high and\r\nextending the full length of the dam, thirty-six feet, but divided into\r\nsix sections, each six feet long. Each of these sections is hinged by\r\nthe lower edge to the crest of the dam, while the upper edge is held\r\nfrom tipping over by chains fastened to cast-iron lugs located about\r\nhalfway down the planking. The chain is held in these lugs by pins\r\nwhich are connected by rod and chain to a capstan, or spindle, located\r\nat one end of the dam, and are so arranged that by turning the spindle\r\nthe pins will be drawn successively, thereby letting the flashboards\r\ndown one at a time. The idea of this arrangement is that, when a flood\r\nis rising, the capstan may be turned with a heavy lever crank, winding\r\nup the chain and pulling down the flashboards one at a time, to give\r\nmore space for the flood to pass through so as to prevent the water\r\nupstream from the dam from rising too high. This plan has prevented the\r\nwashing away of Mr. Miner’s power house on several occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farm Power House on Oriskany Creek\r\n\r\nDam in left background; tail-race in right foreground]\r\n\r\nThe sloping face of the dam receives the direct pressure of the water\r\nand transfers it to the sills, which in turn transfer it to the\r\nconcrete foundation. The reason for sloping the upstream face of the\r\ndam is that the pressure of water is always normal, or perpendicular,\r\nto the surface against which it presses; therefore, if the face of the\r\ndam is sloping, the pressure is downward, rather than outward, as would\r\nbe the case with a vertical face. This results in greater stability for\r\nthe dam, due to the lessened tendency to tip over. With a dam of this\r\ntype the higher the water rises against or over it, the more nearly\r\nvertical is the line of pressure, and the dam is held tightly down on\r\nits foundation instead of tending to tip over. It follows that the\r\nflatter the face of the dam the more stable it will be. Mr. Miner’s dam\r\nraised the water about four feet.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his provision for floods, Mr. Miner did not want to be\r\nunder the necessity of letting down his dam for every freshet, so he\r\nprovided an additional permanent spillway. This is a simple concrete\r\nbarrier, or wall, which flanks one end of the dam. In plan it was\r\nbuilt at an angle with the dam proper, and extends downstream along\r\nthe side of the natural bank. It was built with its crest a few inches\r\nhigher than the main dam, so that during periods of ordinary flow the\r\nsurplus water all passes over the main dam, but as soon as the creek\r\nrises a few inches over the main dam, water begins to flow over this\r\nextra spillway, which, being about forty feet long, will discharge a\r\nconsiderable volume although the water flowing over it is only a few\r\ninches in depth.\r\n\r\nThis spillway is strengthened on the downstream end by a concrete\r\nabutment, which consists of a simple heavy block of concrete extending\r\nabove the top of the spillway. A similar abutment flanks the upstream\r\nend and also constitutes an abutment for one end of the main dam. The\r\nother end of the main dam is set against the opposite bank of the creek\r\nand is protected from washing and is strengthened by a similar concrete\r\nabutment.\r\n\r\nIt was considered desirable to place the little power house away from\r\nthe main channel of the stream, so an earth embankment was built,\r\nextending from the downstream end of the flood spillway, a distance of\r\nabout sixty feet. This embankment, or dyke, is curved in such manner\r\nas to divert the water behind it across a low place to a safe distance\r\nfrom the main channel. Some excavating had to be done behind this\r\nembankment in order to secure a channel of sufficient depth to prevent\r\nthe water from freezing to the bottom and to provide a smooth channel\r\nof approach to the power house. This diversion of the water to one side\r\nfrom the main channel prevents the accumulation of debris and silt,\r\nwhich is a hindrance to the proper operation of a waterwheel. The pool\r\nthus formed is called a “forebay” and is very quiet water. The velocity\r\nof the water flowing through it is so slight that it will not carry\r\nmuch debris.\r\n\r\nAt the downstream end of the forebay the diverting embankment\r\napproaches a steep bank. At this point Mr. Miner built a small power\r\nhouse. Under the power house is the wheel-box, which consists of a\r\nbox-like compartment having one side open to the forebay. This opening\r\nis covered with a coarse screen to prevent leaves or other debris from\r\nentering the wheel, but the water flows through it readily. In the\r\nwheel-box a waterwheel, of the type known as a turbine, was placed.\r\nThis revolves on a vertical shaft, or axle, which is guided by bearings\r\nin a metal case surrounding the wheel and resting on the bottom of the\r\nbox-like compartment. The wheel-case is open at the bottom to allow the\r\nfree escape of the water after it has passed through the wheel. The\r\nconstruction of the turbines is such that the pressure of the water on\r\nthe curved vanes causes the wheel to revolve, just as the pressure of\r\nwind causes a windmill to revolve. The water must have a free escape\r\nfrom the opening in the bottom of the wheel-case and wheel-pit and to\r\nprovide for this a channel, called a “tail-race,” was excavated to\r\ncarry the water back to the creek. Natural conditions were favorable\r\nhere and a tail-race joining the main channel about 100 feet below the\r\npower house was constructed with little difficulty. At the point where\r\nthe tail-race joins the creek the elevation is two feet lower than the\r\npower house, so that there is little tendency for water to back up from\r\nthe creek into the tail-race. There is a certain amount of back-water\r\nduring freshets but the increased height of the water in the forebay at\r\nsuch times partially offsets it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of E. B. Miner’s Power House]\r\n\r\nThe vertical shaft of the turbine extends up through and about two feet\r\nabove the floor near one end of the power house, where it is supported\r\non ball-bearings which enable it to be revolved with very little\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the power house, which is twelve feet by sixteen\r\nfeet in plan and seven feet high to the eaves, was placed an electric\r\ngenerator, or dynamo, rated at 12½ kilowatts, which is equivalent to\r\nabout 17 horsepower. This machine is intended to operate at about 1100\r\nrevolutions per minute. The waterwheel, under the pressure of about\r\nsix feet, would not revolve at such a high rate of speed. It was,\r\ntherefore, impracticable to connect the generator shaft directly to the\r\nwaterwheel shaft and it became necessary to magnify the revolutions by\r\nconnecting the two shafts by belt, using different-sized pulleys. A\r\nlarge wooden pulley, seventy-six inches in diameter, was keyed on\r\nthe end of the waterwheel shaft. A much smaller pulley, about eight\r\ninches in diameter, was placed on the driving shaft of the generator.\r\nA leather belt connects the two, and since the wheel shaft is vertical\r\nand the generator shaft is horizontal, it is necessary to pass the\r\nbelt over an intermediate pulley, or “idler.” This idler is set with\r\nits axis at an angle with both the horizontal and vertical, so that\r\nthe transition of the belt from the horizontal to vertical is made\r\ngradually. Since the driving pulley on the generator shaft is so much\r\nsmaller than the pulley on the wheel shaft, there are about nine\r\nrevolutions of the generator shaft for every revolution of the wheel\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe amount of power which this equipment will generate depends to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the amount of water flowing. Oriskany creek\r\nat this point has a tributary drainage area of about fourteen square\r\nmiles, and the flow required to drive the turbine to full capacity is\r\nabout 2900 cubic feet per minute. This volume is probably available\r\nduring most of the year, but is not available in the driest seasons,\r\nat which times the flow is probably reduced to about 600 cubic feet\r\nper minute. The waterwheel probably has an efficiency of about eighty\r\nper cent, that is, it will probably develop about eighty per cent of\r\nthe theoretical energy of the falling water. The remainder is lost\r\nin friction in the wheel-box at the entrance to the wheel and in the\r\nvelocity still remaining in the water after it leaves the wheel. Five\r\nper cent of the power generated on the wheel shaft is probably lost by\r\nfriction of the belting, so that, at rated load, about seventy-six per\r\ncent of the theoretical power of the water is probably delivered to the\r\nshaft of the generator.\r\n\r\nMr. Miner realized that there would be times when he would not require\r\nall or any of the power which would be produced. At the same time the\r\npond formed by the dam was not large enough to store any considerable\r\namount of water, and he had all the power he would require at any one\r\ntime, so it was not considered necessary to provide storage batteries\r\nto store the electricity. On the other hand he did not wish to be\r\ncompelled to turn the water on and off at frequent intervals, as would\r\nbe necessary unless some auxiliary regulating apparatus were provided.\r\nTherefore, it was decided to provide for the plant to run continuously\r\nand to devise some means to consume the electric current when not\r\nin use. A series of resistance coils were mounted on a frame in the\r\npower house, and connected with the generator. When the demand for\r\nelectric current is less than the capacity of the generator, a small\r\nelectric device automatically throws one or more of these coils into\r\nthe circuit, and the surplus current is converted into heat by the\r\nresistance of the coils. By means of this arrangement it was planned\r\nto run the plant continuously, so that whenever electric current was\r\nwanted it could be had simply by turning a switch at the house or barns.\r\n\r\nThe power plant, including the dam and all the features thus far\r\ndescribed, was completed and in operation before Christmas of the year\r\nin which the construction was begun.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far seen how Mr. Miner developed his water power and\r\ntransformed it into electricity. It remains to see how he gets it to\r\nhis house and farm buildings, and how he uses it after he gets it there.\r\n\r\nThe power house is situated about 1700 feet from the house, where the\r\nelectric current was most wanted. This necessitated the construction of\r\na transmission line. For this purpose a double line of bare aluminum\r\nwire was stretched on a row of poles about twenty feet high and about\r\none hundred feet apart. The poles are provided with ordinary crossarms\r\nat the top on which are mounted the insulators carrying the wires.\r\nAs the transmission line leaves the power house it crosses a highway\r\nand runs in a perfectly straight line to the house. Over the highway\r\ninsulated wires were used as a safety precaution, but bare aluminum\r\nwire was used for the remainder because it was cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe buildings are all in a cluster and a branch from the transmission\r\nline runs into each one where the current is used. All the wires which\r\nare inside of any of the buildings, or are close to the woodwork, are\r\ncovered with insulation, and, where concealed, are further protected by\r\nbeing placed in twisted metal tubes.\r\n\r\nThe first actual use of this hydro-electric power was for lighting. The\r\nhouse was illuminated with electric lights, as were also the barn and\r\nother buildings, there being ultimately about seventy 16-candle-power\r\nlamps in use. Even the pig sty has its electric light, and there is no\r\nmore groping in the dark anywhere about the Miner farm buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lathe in E. B. Miner’s Machine Shop]\r\n\r\nBut there was more power in the creek than was necessary to run the\r\nelectric lights. A circular saw was brought into use, belted to a\r\nmotor, and the supply of firewood was cut in a fraction of the time\r\npreviously required. The same motor is used to drive a lathe and a\r\ndrill in a machine shop which the Miner boys built and equipped. This\r\nmotor is belted to a countershaft from which additional machine tools\r\ncan be driven. One of the Miner boys has developed this machine shop as\r\na combined means of pleasure and profit. In addition to a considerable\r\namount of experimental machine work, he does all the farm repairs and a\r\nconsiderable amount of machine work for neighboring knitting mills, as\r\nwell as general and automobile repair work, all of which has been made\r\npossible by the harnessing of the creek.\r\n\r\nAnother motor, two-horsepower, driven by the electric current, is\r\nbelted to a vacuum pump, which is connected with a one-inch pipe\r\nrunning to the house and the barn. In the house there are two taps, one\r\non each floor, to which the hose of a vacuum cleaner may be attached,\r\nand Oriskany creek does the rest; the floors are cleaned in the most\r\nmodern, sanitary and thorough manner. In the barn the pipe from the\r\nvacuum pump runs above the cow stanchions with a tap at alternate\r\nstanchions. The tubes of the milking machines are attached and the\r\ncreek milks twenty or twenty-five cows twice each day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drill in E. B. Miner’s Machine Shop\r\n\r\nNote the electric motor in background belted to countershaft near the\r\nceiling]\r\n\r\nIn the dairy room is a one-half-horsepower motor, which may be belted\r\nto the cream separator or churn, and on the hot summer days it is\r\nfrequently belted to the ice cream freezer. An ingenious float device\r\nin the separator turns off the power when the cream is all separated\r\nfrom the milk and trips a can of clear water into the heavy, revolving\r\nbowl of the separator, which still retains enough momentum to rinse\r\nitself thoroughly before coming to rest.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner other applications of the power have followed from\r\ntime to time, and one at a time most of the hand cranks on the Miner\r\nfarm have been relegated to the scrap heap; even the grindstone is\r\noperated by a long, narrow belt running from the little motor in the\r\ndairy out through the door to an adjoining compartment.\r\n\r\nIn the Miner residence are five electrical heaters, which Mr. Miner\r\nstates will raise the temperature to 75 degrees when it is zero\r\noutside. Since these heaters were installed there has not been much use\r\nfor the wood saw. There are also in the house some electric fans which\r\nstir up a breeze on the hot days. An electric ventilator fan in the\r\nattic insures good ventilation at all times. In the kitchen the Miners\r\ncook for a family of from five to ten with an electric range, and iron\r\nwith an electric iron attached by a cord to an ordinary electric lamp\r\nsocket. A smaller motor operates the egg beater and cream whipper;\r\nanother small motor drives the sewing machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. B. Miner’s Dairy Room\r\n\r\nVacuum milking machines in background; also small motor which drives\r\nthe cream separator and churn in the foreground]\r\n\r\nThe little motor in the dairy room also drives a single-acting plunger\r\npump, which forces water up to a galvanized iron tank in the attic\r\nof the house, whence water is piped and furnished by gravity to the\r\nbathroom and kitchen. An electric heater in the kitchen heats the water\r\nfor the bath and kitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Cooking Outfit, E. B. Miner’s Home]\r\n\r\nOther miscellaneous uses are made of the never-failing power of\r\nthe creek, such as filling the silo, and the power plant requires\r\npractically no attention. Self-oiling devices on the waterwheel\r\nand generator, and the use of the resistance coils to consume the\r\nsuperfluous electricity, obviate the necessity for attention, except to\r\nfill the oil cups every few weeks. Practically no trouble has been\r\nexperienced in the operation, the only interruption so far being due\r\nto the formation of anchor ice in the forebay, which causes a little\r\ntrouble on extremely cold days. The waterwheel is run continuously,\r\nnight and day, summer and winter, and electric light or current is\r\nalways available at the touch of a button or by throwing a switch.\r\n\r\nAs to the cost of his plant Mr. Miner would give no figures. His motto\r\nseems to be, “Not how cheap, but how good,” and he states that it would\r\nrequire several times the cost to induce him to give up his water-power\r\nplant. Engineers estimate the cost of reproducing his plant, including\r\nthe dam, power house, waterwheel, generator and transmission line, at\r\nabout $1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER HOME POWER PLANT, NORTHWEST BAY, LAKE GEORGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the attractive summer homes on the shores of Lake George is\r\nthat of Mr. Stephen Loines of Brooklyn, located at the upper end of\r\nNorthwest bay, about four miles above Bolton Landing. On his property\r\nthere was a small lake known as Wing pond, having an area of about\r\nseven acres and situated at an elevation of about 180 feet above Lake\r\nGeorge. The outlet was a small brook, which runs through Mr. Loines’\r\nproperty and flows into Northwest bay.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1902, Mr. Loines built a dam across the outlet of Wing\r\npond, raising its surface about two feet. He ran a galvanized iron pipe\r\nline from the dam, down the side of the hill and along the brook. It\r\nwas four inches in diameter for a short distance, then reduced to three\r\ninches and finally to two inches, and was about 1200 feet long in all,\r\nwith a fall of about 110 feet. A twenty-four-inch waterwheel of the\r\nimpulse type was installed in a small power house to which the pipe\r\nline was run. The waterwheel developed about three horsepower and was\r\nbelted to an electric generator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dam at Outlet of Wing Pond]\r\n\r\nThe power was found to be insufficient to supply Mr. Loines’ needs\r\nat that time. He desired to burn thirty-five 16-candle-power carbon\r\nfilament lamps and to charge a 40-cell battery for an electric launch.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the fall of 1908, Mr. Loines raised his dam two feet\r\nhigher and installed a six-inch spiral riveted steel pipe line, running\r\nfrom the dam down a gulley on the surface of the ground, for about\r\n1600 feet, to a point a short distance from the place where the creek\r\nflows into Lake George. At this point he built a small power house and\r\ninstalled a twenty-four-inch waterwheel of the impulse type. This wheel\r\noperates under a head of 165 feet and is directly connected by a\r\nshaft to a six and one-half kilowatt generator, which operates at 500\r\nrevolutions per minute. This generator supplies a 60-cell house battery\r\n(45 lamps), an 84-cell battery for a 35-foot cabin launch, a 48-cell\r\nbattery for a 20-foot open launch and a 40-cell battery for an electric\r\nroadster, all of which are in pretty continuous use from about the\r\nfirst of June to the first of November of each year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Power Transmission Line, Northwest Bay, Lake George]\r\n\r\nAs this new development superseded the older one and proved entirely\r\nadequate for the needs of Mr. Loines’ country place, the old\r\ndevelopment was made over so that it could be utilized for sawing\r\nfirewood to supply the superintendent’s cottage and the other buildings\r\nduring the winter. A countershaft was erected on the wall of the old\r\npower house, which is a building 7 feet by 10 feet in plan and about\r\n8 feet high. This countershaft has three counterpulleys, by means of\r\nwhich the speed of the waterwheel may be doubled or trebled. For the\r\npurpose of sawing firewood a leather belt is placed on one of the\r\npulleys of the countershaft and run through a small aperture in the\r\nside of the power house to the driving pulley of a circular saw, which\r\nstands on a small porch at one end of the power house building.\r\n\r\nMr. Loines’ superintendent stated that by operating the saw\r\ncontinuously for eight hours it would be possible to saw twelve cords\r\nof wood, which he estimated to be sufficient to supply his cottage, and\r\nsuch other of the buildings as need wood, for the entire winter. This\r\nillustrates very aptly the large amount of work that a small power is\r\ncapable of doing in a short time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to lighting his house and buildings by means of the power\r\ndeveloped at his new power house, Mr. Loines also has a rather unusual\r\napplication of power on his summer place. He is an enthusiastic student\r\nof astronomy and has built a small but elaborately equipped observatory\r\non the hillside above the cottage. The observatory is so constructed\r\nthat the roof can be removed entirely from the building to a support\r\nat the back of the observatory. The roof is mounted on wheels and Mr.\r\nLoines uses his electric power to do the work of moving the roof when\r\nhe wishes to make astronomical observations with his telescope. This is\r\naccomplished by means of a small 1½-horsepower motor which operates at\r\n1275 revolutions per minute and is connected by belt to a countershaft,\r\nwhich in turn is connected by a worm gear and a chain drive to the\r\ncarriage on which the roof is supported. In this manner the roof may be\r\nmoved the required distance in two or three minutes by simply throwing\r\nthe switch which is inside the observatory building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stephen Loines’ Power House, Northwest Bay, Lake George\r\n\r\nAt left, 4-in. water pipe; at right, transmission line connection]\r\n\r\nMr. Loines’ new power house is a stone masonry building, the masonry\r\nbeing uncoursed rubble, constructed in a very artistic and attractive\r\nmanner. The building is 9½ feet by 15½ feet in plan and is about 9 feet\r\nhigh to the eaves. It has a concrete foundation and the floor is of\r\nfirst-class concrete. A concrete foundation, about 3 feet by 5 feet,\r\nprovides a permanent support for the water motor and the generator.\r\nThis foundation projects 6 inches above the level of the concrete\r\nfloor. On one end of the foundation stands the waterwheel, there being\r\nan opening about 8 inches by 18 inches through the concrete base under\r\nthe water motor to carry off the water after it has passed through\r\nthe wheel. The supply pipe for the waterwheel enters the side of the\r\nbuilding on a level about one foot above the floor. Just inside, the\r\npipe reduces to a diameter of about 2½ inches and is fitted with a\r\ngate valve by means of which the water may be turned on or off. The\r\nnozzle of the waterwheel is also equipped with an adjusting device\r\nby means of which the size of the jet issuing from the nozzle may be\r\nvaried in order to secure various speeds or the maximum efficiency\r\nof the waterwheel. The setting required to give the desired speed is\r\ndetermined by experiment by the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM POWER DEVELOPMENT IN SCHOHARIE COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the driveway approach to the farmhouse of Jared Van\r\nWagenen, Jr., at Lawyersville, Schoharie county, N. Y., stand two large,\r\nstone gateway posts. On the capstone of one of these posts is engraved,\r\n“Agriculture the Oldest Occupation,” and on the other, “Agriculture\r\nthe Greatest Science.” In keeping with the latter sentiment, Mr. Van\r\nWagenen has conducted his agricultural operations in such a manner\r\nthat he is looked upon as one of the most scientific and progressive\r\nagriculturists in the State. He takes an active interest in such\r\naffairs as farmers’ institutes and is considered an authority on the\r\nscience of agriculture. His farm and buildings are equipped with the\r\nmost modern conveniences and labor-saving devices.\r\n\r\nThere is a small stream which runs through the farm and flows into the\r\nCobleskill. This stream is so small that one may easily step across it\r\nin the summer-time. About half a mile from the farmhouse is an old mill\r\ndam which forms a pond with an area of more than an acre. The dam was\r\nbuilt long ago when small sawmills dotted that section of the State.\r\nThe timber having been practically all cut off, this mill, along with\r\nhundreds of others, was long since abandoned. Mr. Van Wagenen conceived\r\nthe idea of harnessing its wasting energy and making it do some of his\r\nfarm work for him. The story of how he accomplished this is best given\r\nin his own words, as follows:\r\n\r\n“About eight years ago I began to figure on how to get this power to\r\nthe house where it could do a little work. My first thought was to\r\ncarry it there by belt cables, but figures proved that the friction\r\nwould eat up the five horsepower available. Electric power, easily\r\ntransmitted with little loss, was the only solution. I talked with many\r\nwho understood electricity and its engineering features and most of\r\nthem laughed at the idea of such a small installation. Had I wanted to\r\nconstruct a million-dollar plant there would have been whole libraries\r\nof advice; but a small plant to run entirely alone and be controlled by\r\na seven-hundred-foot-wire was evidently a novelty. After a good deal of\r\nstudying and feeling my way the plans were made and the work begun.\r\n\r\n“The stream being so small, the most rigid economy of water had to be\r\nobserved, so I installed a nine-inch upright turbine in an upright\r\nwooden case, building the case myself, where it would get the most\r\nbenefit of the fifteen-foot head. This turbine, furnishing about five\r\nhorsepower, I belted to a three-kilowatt, or four-horsepower, one\r\nhundred and twenty-five volt direct current generator, which would\r\neasily take care of seventy-five metal filament incandescent lamps.\r\nI next installed a waterwheel governor to insure a steady flow of\r\nelectricity. It took about seventy-four hundred feet of weatherproof\r\ncopper wire, strung on wooden poles, which were cut on the farm, to\r\ncarry the electricity to my home and the farm buildings and to the\r\nhouse of a neighbor. As it is more than half a mile from the house to\r\nthe plant it is out of the question to go there every night and morning\r\nto stop and start the machinery. Of course it is possible to let this\r\nplant run night and day during the wet season, but in dry times it is\r\nbest to save the water when the power is not needed. A neighbor living\r\nabout seven hundred feet from the power station kindly starts and stops\r\nthe machinery with a wire stationed at his bedroom window. This wire\r\ncontrols a valve and counterweight. At five o’clock in the morning he\r\npulls the wire and the lights come on and at a certain hour of the\r\nnight he releases the wire and they go out. In payment for this service\r\nI light his house and barns free of charge.\r\n\r\n“Our maintenance charges are very small; almost negligible. I think our\r\nwaterwheel behaves better every year. Carbon brushes for the generator\r\nlast a long while and oil is a very small item. Each year I am\r\nimproving the plant, and very soon I expect to install a motor-driven\r\nwashing machine and wringer to prepare the clothes for the electric\r\niron and to put a vacuum cleaning outfit in the house.\r\n\r\n“Although I consider the cost of our plant about $500, it was installed\r\nunder the most rigid economy in every respect and mainly by my own\r\nhands. The dam was already built and needed only some trifling repairs.\r\nThe gate control is my own get-up, and, while the cost is trifling,\r\nit took considerable study to get it to work right. I did most of the\r\nhouse wiring, using concealed knob and tube for the living rooms of the\r\nhouse; moulding and open wiring for the other rooms and for the barns.\r\nThis material cost me about $40. Of course, I do not in any instance\r\nfigure in my own labor, as the work was all done at odd times.”\r\n\r\nThis small power development, using the dam already built, cost Mr. Van\r\nWagenen about $500 as follows:\r\n\r\n    Dynamo, 3 k.w. (second-hand)                  $50\r\n    Waterwheel, 4 h.p. (naked wheel)               55\r\n    Governor (new)                                 75\r\n    Wire (7400 feet)                              210\r\n    Labor (installing waterwheel)                  40\r\n    Fixtures (lamps and the like)                  38\r\n    One small motor, 2 h.p. (new)                  50\r\n                                                 ----\r\n          Total                                  $518\r\n                                                 ====\r\n\r\nThe plant furnishes power sufficient to light the farmhouse and all\r\nof the buildings with electricity, as well as those of the neighbor\r\nwho turns the water on and off. In the dairy a small electric motor of\r\nabout 3 horsepower, actuated by the electric current, drives the cream\r\nseparator and also furnishes power for running the grindstone, feed\r\ncutters, hay fork and fanning mill, in addition to which the power is\r\nalso used to milk the cows and cut the ensilage and to do numerous\r\nother bits of work about the place. Mr. Van Wagenen states that his\r\nwater power does work equivalent to that of a hired man the year round\r\nand does away with numerous chores and laborious duties about the place.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement which Mr. Van Wagenen devised to turn on the water\r\nat his plant and to shut it off again is unique and interesting. It\r\nconsists of a triangular frame lever about two feet wide and seven feet\r\nhigh, hinged at one of the bottom corners. The other bottom corner\r\nis connected to a sliding gate which fits over the feed pipe for the\r\nwaterwheel. At the top are fastened two wires, one of which runs to the\r\nhouse of Mr. Van Wagenen’s accommodating neighbor, and the other runs\r\nover a pulley and has a counterweight attached to it. When the water\r\nis to be turned on, the neighbor pulls the wire and the gate is raised\r\nby the leverage of the frame; when the water is to be shut off, he\r\nreleases the wire and the counterweight pulls the lever back, allowing\r\nthe gate to fall in place again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washing Machine, Driven by Electric Motor]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SMALL POWER DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John T. McDonald, who has a farm about five miles from Delhi,\r\nDelaware county, N. Y., some ten years ago began making good use of a\r\npower development from a small stream on his farm. He lights his house\r\nand buildings, runs saws, grinders and various machines in a little\r\nshop on rainy days and in the winter. His dam was made from stone and\r\nearth from the nearby fields and cost very little. It forms a pond,\r\ncovering, when full, about four and one-half acres of land. The pond is\r\nwell stocked with trout and other fish, and each winter Mr. McDonald\r\ncuts about 500 tons of ice from it. Mr. McDonald turns on the water\r\nat his dam by means of an electric switch at the house and regulates\r\nthe voltage also in a similar manner. From the pond the water is led\r\nthrough a hydraulic race, or canal, about 900 feet long, to one of the\r\nfarm buildings where the waterwheels are installed. The head, or fall,\r\nat this point is about 15 feet and there are three waterwheels of the\r\nturbine type: one that develops 25 horsepower, another that develops\r\n6 horsepower and a third that develops about 3 horsepower. The large\r\nwheel is used to run a sawmill and feed mill. The 6-horsepower wheel\r\ndrives an electric generator, or dynamo, which furnishes the electric\r\nlights, and also electricity for driving the small motors about the\r\nplace. The 3-horsepower wheel runs the small saws, machine tools, etc.,\r\nin Mr. McDonald’s shop.\r\n\r\nA few miles east from Mr. Van Wagenen’s farm in Schoharie county is\r\nanother small power development owned by Mr. Frank Caspar. He has\r\ninstalled two waterwheels on a small creek and uses the power from\r\nthem to drive the machinery in a table and furniture factory. He has\r\nanother small waterwheel of the turbine type driving a little dynamo\r\nwhich generates electricity for electric light. Mr. Caspar lights his\r\nfactory buildings, his home, a neighboring church and the main street\r\nin the village with electricity from this little dynamo. An ingenious\r\ndevice of his own invention makes it possible to start and stop the\r\npower from the house by simply pulling a wire which operates a valve\r\nin a small water pipe, from which water under pressure is let into a\r\nhydraulic cylinder. This causes the piston of the cylinder to rise,\r\nand the piston being directly connected to a gate in the water pipe\r\ninlet, allows the water to flow into the waterwheel. When it is desired\r\nto stop the plant, a pull on the companion wire causes the reverse\r\noperation to take place and the power is shut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farm Power Development of John T. McDonald, Delaware Co.,\r\nN. Y.]\r\n\r\nNear the village of Berlin, in eastern Rensselaer county, N. Y., there\r\nis a small power development owned by Mr. Arthur Cowee. His source of\r\npower is a small trout brook which flows through the farm. Mr. Cowee is\r\na producer of fancy gladiolus bulbs, on a large scale. His principal\r\npower development, consisting of a 36-inch impulse waterwheel, under\r\na pressure due to a fall of about 210 feet, is used mostly for the\r\npurpose of operating a circular saw and other machinery connected with\r\na sawmill. The water is diverted from the natural channel of the brook\r\nat a considerable distance from the place where the waterwheel is\r\ninstalled and is carried in an artificial channel, about four feet wide\r\nand three feet deep, around the side of the hill, where it runs into\r\na shallow basin which has been excavated by Mr. Cowee at a suitable\r\nlocation. By means of this basin, or artificial pond, practically all\r\nof the flow of the brook may be stored during the night and used to\r\noperate the waterwheel during the day. In this manner the full power\r\nvalue of the brook is realized. There is a ten-inch, cast-iron pipe\r\nline, about 1680 feet long, which runs from the pond down the side of\r\nthe hill to the waterwheel. This pipe line was placed under ground from\r\nthree to four feet in order to avoid freezing in the winter. Mr. Cowee\r\nestimates that the development, including the diverting dam and canal,\r\npond, pipe line, waterwheel, circular saw and accessories, cost him\r\na total of about $7000. He states that he can saw about 4000 feet of\r\nlumber in a day with this power.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this development, Mr. Cowee also has a small impulse\r\nwaterwheel in his bulb house. This wheel is operated by water furnished\r\nfrom the system of the local water company. It is directly connected\r\nto a small electric generator which furnishes electricity sufficient\r\nfor 157 sixteen-candle-power carbon-filament lamps which are installed\r\nthroughout the bulb house. The generator does not produce enough\r\nelectric current to run all of these lights at the same time, but it\r\nwill operate as many as forty-five or fifty lights at one time, which\r\nis all that is necessary to meet the requirements.\r\n\r\nMr. D. F. Paine of Wadhams, Essex county, N. Y., has a dam at the\r\noutlet of Lincoln pond. The water surface, when the pond is full, is\r\nabout twelve feet above the normal and spreads over an extensive tract\r\nof low, marshy land. The pond thus formed is about three miles long\r\nand from one-quarter to three-quarters of a mile wide. The water is\r\nconducted from the dam to the penstock, a distance of about a mile\r\nand a half, securing a fall of 320 feet. At this point Mr. Paine has\r\nconstructed a power house, where he generates electricity which he\r\ntransmits to Mineville for use in the mines. This power is transmitted\r\na distance of about eight miles.\r\n\r\nAt Chazy, N. Y., near the western shore of Lake Champlain and at a\r\npoint about fifteen miles north of the city of Plattsburg, there\r\nis located a modern stock and dairy farm which, in its operation,\r\nexemplifies the manifold advantages to be derived from the use of\r\nhydro-electric power for electric lighting and for the various power\r\nrequirements of the farm. This farm, which is owned by Mr. W. H.\r\nMiner and is called “Heart’s Delight,” covers an area of 5160 acres.\r\nAbout 1200 acres are cultivated, 1200 acres are in pasture and the\r\nremainder in woodland. The output consists of live stock and dairy\r\nproducts, all crops grown on the farm being fed to the stock and only\r\nfinished products being shipped out. The live stock includes registered\r\nPercheron and Belgian horses, pure-bred, short-horn Durham and Guernsey\r\ncattle, Dorset sheep and high-grade hogs for the production of sausage,\r\nhams and bacon. There are also poultry and squabs, and a fish hatchery\r\nfor the propagation of trout. The entire output goes directly to\r\nhigh-grade hotels in New York, Washington and Chicago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Power House, “Heart’s Delight” Farm]\r\n\r\nTwo streams pass through the southern portion of the farm, the smaller\r\none being known as Tracy brook and the larger one as Chazy river. It\r\nwas decided to provide the farm with electricity for light and power.\r\nEnough water power was found in these streams to furnish a cheap and\r\nreliable source of energy. Accordingly, a hydro-electric plant was\r\ninstalled several years ago and has given such satisfaction that\r\nthe equipment has been increased from time to time, and some novel\r\napplications have resulted. Three small concrete dams were built across\r\nTracy brook to form storage reservoirs. A concrete penstock, or pipe,\r\n44 inches in diameter and 670 feet long, carries the water from the\r\ndownstream reservoir to a concrete power house, where a fall of 19 feet\r\nis secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alternating Current Transmission Line, “Heart’s Delight”\r\nFarm]\r\n\r\nThe power house equipment consists of two water turbines automatically\r\ngoverned and directly connected respectively to one 30-kilowatt and\r\none 12½-kilowatt, 220-volt, direct current generators. The current is\r\ntransmitted over a pole line, a mile and a quarter long, to a central\r\nstation in the main group of farm buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Cooking Outfit]\r\n\r\nAnother dam was built across the Chazy river. This is of concrete, and,\r\nafter passing through screens at the intake gate house, built into the\r\ndam, the water flows through a concrete penstock, 48 inches wide by 60\r\ninches high and 630 feet long, to the power house where a fall of\r\n30 feet is obtained. There are two turbines here, belt connected to\r\nalternating current generators, and the current is transmitted over a\r\npole line, nearly three miles long, to the central station.\r\n\r\nAn auxiliary to the water-power development consists of two hydraulic\r\nrams, pumping water from one of the Tracy brook reservoirs to a\r\n60,000-gallon tank, 100 feet above the ground, for fire protection for\r\nthe buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are in all about twenty-five motors installed in the various\r\nbuildings. The electric current actuates these motors, which are used\r\nto drive or operate numerous machines and labor-saving devices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-driven Vacuum Pump\r\n\r\nFor milking machines and vacuum cleaners]\r\n\r\nAn entire load of hay is lifted from the wagon and stored in the mow\r\nby a ten-horsepower motor. A root-cutting machine is operated by\r\na two-horsepower motor mounted on the ceiling. A one and one-half\r\nhorsepower motor drives a vacuum pump, which operates the milking\r\nmachines; five machines are used, each of which will milk two cows\r\nsimultaneously. A one and one-half horsepower motor runs the cream\r\nseparator, and a three-horsepower motor drives the big churn;\r\nand motors are used for driving the water pumps, as well as the\r\nbrine-circulating pumps in the ice-making plant. A grist mill,\r\ndriven by electric motor, is part of the farm equipment, and the\r\nsausage-chopping and mixing machines are driven by a four-horsepower\r\nmotor. Roots for the sheep are cut by a machine driven by motors of\r\none and one-half and two horsepower, and food for the fish is prepared\r\nby a grinding machine driven by a two-horsepower motor. Wood-working\r\nmachines and machine tools are driven by motors in the carpenter and\r\nmachine shops. In addition to the uses already mentioned, the electric\r\npower is also used to pump water, shear the sheep, clip the horses,\r\nwash, dry and iron the clothes, heat the house, cook the food, freeze\r\nthe ice cream, cool the house in the summer, curl the ladies’ hair and\r\nplay the piano.\r\n\r\nThe “Heart’s Delight” farm power equipment is much more extensive than\r\nwould be warranted on a farm of ordinary size, but the installation\r\nserves to illustrate the extent to which the application of power may\r\nbe carried, on an unusually large produce farm. In many instances a\r\ncommunity of farmers could develop such a water power and distribute\r\nthe power among themselves to mutual advantage and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING A SMALL WATER POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prime requisite to the creation of a water power is the existence\r\nof falling or flowing water. The amount of power which may be available\r\nvaries; first, with the amount of water flowing, and second, with the\r\namount of fall. It requires about one cubic foot of water per second,\r\nfalling through a height of ten feet, to make available one theoretical\r\nhorsepower. The fall may be either naturally concentrated at one point\r\nin a cascade or it may be artificially concentrated, for the purpose\r\nof development, by combining the fall of several cascades or a series\r\nof rapids. This may be accomplished by either of two methods; first,\r\nby building a dam at the downstream end of the rapids to impound the\r\nwater so that the entire fall is concentrated at the dam, or second,\r\nby building a dam at the upstream end of the rapids and conducting\r\nthe water through a closed pipe to the lower end of the rapids, where\r\nthe resulting water pressure will be exactly the same as in the first\r\ninstance. A variation of the latter method consists of diverting the\r\nwater from the natural channel at the head of the rapids and carrying\r\nit in a canal, on a slight down grade, along the side of a hill to a\r\nsuitable point at which the water is turned into penstocks which run\r\ndirectly down the slope to the stream, where the power development may\r\nbe made. The latter method, involving the construction of a canal, is\r\nopen to the objection that considerable trouble is usually experienced\r\nfrom the accumulation of ice in the winter time. The first two methods\r\ndescribed are the most common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cascade on Indian Creek, Warren Co., N. Y. Typical\r\nExample of Undeveloped Water Power]\r\n\r\nThe amount of water which flows in a stream, in New York State, whether\r\nlarge or small, is subject to remarkable variation. Only one who has\r\nobserved very carefully and continuously, by actual measurement, the\r\nextremes of fluctuation to which a flowing stream is subject, is in a\r\nposition fully to appreciate this. Some of the larger rivers of New\r\nYork State are subject to such fluctuations of flow that the amount\r\nof water discharged during flood periods is several hundred times as\r\nmuch as the amount that flows in the extreme dry period. Also in many\r\ninstances from one-half to three-fourths of the total runoff of the\r\nstream during the year occurs during a period of a few weeks in the\r\nspring months, when the accumulated snow and ice is melted and runs off\r\nin conjunction with the warm spring rains. Unfortunately, reliable data\r\nrelating to the fluctuations of small streams in this State are very\r\nmeager. It is, however, a matter of record that the smaller streams for\r\nwhich records are available are subject to greater fluctuations per\r\nunit of tributary watershed area than are the larger streams. It seems\r\nlogical, therefore, to assume that the very small creeks and brooks\r\nare subject to fluctuations relatively greater than those recorded for\r\nstreams of only relatively small size. This fact must be borne in mind\r\nby any one who proposes to develop the power on a stream, for if it is\r\noverlooked the project is not so assured of success. For most purposes\r\npower is required in about the same amount for all seasons of the year,\r\nwhile, as previously stated, the streams run off most of their waters\r\nin the spring. Therefore, in developing the power of any particular\r\nstream, if the power is required to be fairly constant at all seasons\r\nof the year as is usually the case, there are two considerations which\r\nmust not be overlooked:\r\n\r\nFirst—Will the minimum flow of the stream—that is, the flow which\r\noccurs in the driest season of a dry year—be sufficient to furnish the\r\namount of power required?\r\n\r\nSecond—If the minimum flow is not sufficient, what means are available\r\nfor storing the surplus water from the wet season until the dry season?\r\n\r\nThe subject of equalizing stream flow throughout the year by means of\r\nstorage reservoirs has been so thoroughly discussed in the reports of\r\nthe Commission that further discussion in this connection does not seem\r\nwarranted.\r\n\r\nTaking a general average throughout the State of New York, large\r\nstreams may be depended upon to produce from one-twentieth to\r\none-quarter of a cubic foot of water per second per square mile of\r\ntributary drainage area, during the driest period. Streams having\r\nonly one or two square miles of drainage frequently dry up entirely\r\nin the dry seasons. If a power development is proposed of such a\r\ncharacter that some considerable sacrifice of power might be made\r\nin the dry seasons with no serious loss, most small streams may be\r\ndeveloped to provide for as much as one-quarter to one-half of a cubic\r\nfoot per second per square mile. On the other hand it is often found\r\npracticable to provide a small auxiliary power plant, such as gasolene\r\nor kerosene, to fall back upon in dry weather, or to supply extra power\r\noccasionally, in which case the water-power development need not be\r\nlimited to the minimum flow of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe power of falling water may be applied to practical purposes in\r\nseveral ways. One of the simplest ways, should it be desired to use\r\nthe power of the stream to pump water, is by means of what is known as\r\na hydraulic ram. This is a device which operates on the principle of\r\nthe impact due to the sudden stoppage of flow of a column of water. By\r\nmeans of this device, or engine, water falling through a very small\r\nheight may be used to raise a portion of the same, or a comparatively\r\nsmall amount of other water, to an elevation considerably higher\r\nthan the supply. The mechanical efficiency of the hydraulic ram is\r\ncomparatively high under certain conditions but generally is very low,\r\nuseful work which manufacturers claim may be realized varying from\r\n38 per cent to 80 per cent. The minimum fall under which a ram will\r\neffectively elevate water is about two feet. This fall will elevate\r\nabout one-thirteenth of the supply to a height of twenty feet. Under\r\nthe most favorable conditions and a fair amount of fall, a ram may\r\nelevate water as high as 120 feet. The proportion of water which may be\r\nelevated varies from one-twentieth to two-sevenths of the total\r\nsupplied; and, accordingly, the proportion of water which must be\r\nwasted at the impetus valve of the ram varies from five-sevenths to\r\nnineteen-twentieths. These proportions both depend upon the ratio of\r\nthe amount of supply to the amount to be elevated, that is, a small\r\nproportion may be elevated to a considerable height and vice versa. In\r\ncases where a small brook of suitable quality is available for domestic\r\nwater supply, it is often entirely practicable to install a hydraulic\r\nram which will pump a sufficient proportion of the amount of supply to\r\nfurnish a household with all the water necessary for ordinary domestic\r\npurposes, in spite of the fact that the brook may be on a lower level\r\nthan the house. Owing to the fact that a hydraulic ram may be applied\r\nonly to the purposes of elevating water, it is not generally considered\r\nas a means of developing water power, although in the broadest sense it\r\ndoes constitute such a development.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the purposes for which power is usually required\r\nare not only for the elevation of water for a water supply, but for\r\nmany other and varied requirements. In such cases the power must be\r\ndeveloped in such manner that it may be utilized to operate machinery\r\nnear the site of the development, or transmitted for some distance, and\r\nthere used to operate machinery or for lighting or heating. To develop\r\nwater power in this manner requires some kind of a waterwheel.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of waterwheels, the principal ones being known\r\nas “undershot,” “overshot,” “breastwheel,” “turbine” and “impulse.” The\r\novershot wheel is a type very familiar to most readers, being usually\r\nof home manufacture. It consists, usually, of a wooden wheel with water\r\ncompartments arranged at regular intervals around the periphery. The\r\nwater is fed into the wheel at the top, just off the center. It flows\r\ninto the compartment at the top and the weight being exerted on one\r\nside of the supporting axle causes the wheel to revolve, the water\r\nspilling out when the compartment, or water pocket, reaches the bottom.\r\nThis type of wheel depends entirely for its power upon the weight of\r\nthe water which causes the wheel to revolve.\r\n\r\nThe undershot wheel is very similar in construction to the overshot\r\ntype but depends more for its power on the velocity of the flowing\r\nwater which strikes the blades, or buckets, on the under side of the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turbine Type of Waterwheel\r\n\r\nPhantom view of wheel-case]\r\n\r\nThe breastwheel is also similar in construction but is in reality an\r\nimprovement upon the overshot and undershot types. It depends for its\r\npower on a combination of the action of gravity and the impulse of\r\nthe water striking the blades, or buckets. The water is fed into the\r\nwheel a little below the height of the axle and usually enters with\r\nconsiderable velocity, a part of which is transformed into useful work\r\nby the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe turbine is a type of wheel which is very extensively used. It is\r\nusually constructed of metal and consists primarily of a series of\r\ncurved vanes, or runners, whose arrangement is similar to a screw. The\r\naction of the water flowing through these curved vanes causes the vanes\r\nand shaft to revolve, the vanes being solidly connected to the shaft,\r\nwhich may be either horizontal or vertical.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental working principle of an impulse waterwheel is the\r\nturning into useful work of the impulse due to the velocity of a jet of\r\nwater issuing from a contracted orifice. This is accomplished usually\r\nby conveying the water from the dam or other source of supply to the\r\nwaterwheel in a pipe of comparatively large size and then gradually\r\nreducing the size of the pipe immediately in front of the wheel to a\r\ncomparatively small size by means of a reducer section, which is fitted\r\nwith a nozzle the opening of which may or may not be regulated in size.\r\nThis contraction of the stream of flowing water causes a spouting of\r\nthe water under pressure and the water issues in a jet with very high\r\nvelocity. The jet thus issuing from the nozzle strikes the cups of\r\nthe impulse wheel which are arranged at regular intervals around the\r\ncircumference of a metallic disc which is centered on an axle. The cups\r\ntransfer the velocity of the jet to the wheel, and the water drops from\r\nthem with very little velocity left in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Impulse Type of Waterwheel\r\n\r\nShowing jet of water striking cups. Wheel illustrated is very powerful,\r\nbut principle of small wheels is the same]\r\n\r\nIn general, the turbine type of wheel is best adapted to low heads, or\r\nfalls, and the use of comparatively large volumes of water, and the\r\nimpulse wheel is best adapted to the use of a comparatively high head,\r\nor fall, and a comparatively small amount of water. There are certain\r\nintermediate conditions for which the manufacturers of each type claim\r\ntheir wheel is best suited and in such instance a study of local\r\nconditions is always necessary to determine which type of wheel is best\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nThe development of a water power by means of any kind of a waterwheel\r\nresults in the conversion of the energy of the falling water into\r\nmechanical power which is exerted in a more or less rapidly revolving\r\nshaft. In order to apply this power of the revolving shaft to some\r\nuseful purpose, there are several methods which may be used. The shaft\r\nmay be directly connected to the shaft of an electric generator, or\r\ndynamo, to generate electric current, or it may be directly connected\r\nto a machine which it is desired to operate, provided the machine,\r\nor dynamo, is required to operate at the same speed as that of the\r\nwheel shaft. This is frequently not the case, so that under ordinary\r\nconditions the shaft of the wheel is fitted with a pulley, which in\r\nturn is connected by belt to another pulley on the machine which is to\r\nbe driven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-driven Mangle]\r\n\r\nBy using pulleys of different diameters on the shaft of the waterwheel\r\nand the shaft of the machinery to be driven, the speed of the machine\r\nmay be several times more or less than the speed of the waterwheel.\r\nFor instance, if the waterwheel revolves 200 revolutions per minute\r\nand it is desired to operate a machine, connected by belt, at a speed\r\nof 1000 revolutions per minute, a pulley of comparatively small size,\r\nsay four inches in diameter, is placed on the shaft to be driven, and\r\na pulley of five times the diameter, or twenty inches, is placed on\r\nthe shaft of the waterwheel. This causes the shaft of the machine to\r\nrevolve at a speed five times as great as the waterwheel. If the speed\r\nof the waterwheel is greater than that required for the machinery to\r\nbe operated, then the reverse operation is followed out, placing a\r\nsmall pulley on the shaft of the waterwheel and a larger one on the\r\nshaft of the machinery to be driven. If the speed of the waterwheel\r\nis to be magnified more than about six times, it usually requires the\r\ninstallation of a countershaft and another series of pulleys in order\r\nto avoid the use of very large and very small pulleys. A pulley which\r\nhas a very small diameter does not operate satisfactorily without\r\nconsiderable loss of power, and a very large pulley is objectionable on\r\naccount of the space which it requires.\r\n\r\nWhen a water power is once developed it may be applied to practical use\r\neither near the place of development or at a considerable distance.\r\nIf it is to be used for power only, and not for lighting, and can be\r\nused where it is developed, there is no need of converting it into\r\nelectricity. But if it is to be used for lighting, or for power to\r\nbe applied at a considerable distance from the water-power site,\r\nthen it becomes necessary to convert the power into electricity, in\r\nwhich form it may be most conveniently transmitted from one place to\r\nanother. This requires an electric generator, or dynamo, to be driven\r\nby the waterwheel, and a transmission line, preferably of copper or\r\naluminum wire, to carry the current where it is to be used. In order to\r\nreconvert the current into power at the end of the transmission line,\r\nwhere the power is to be used, it is necessary to run the current into\r\nan electric motor, the shaft of which is made to revolve by the action\r\nof the electric current. This motor may then be connected directly, or\r\nby belt, gears or chain drive, to the machine to be driven.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that in each of these steps of changing from\r\nwater power to electric current, in transmitting the current over the\r\nwires, in reconverting it into power, and in transferring this power\r\nfrom a motor to a power-operated machine, there are losses of energy.\r\nThese losses vary considerably in different instances. Assuming, for\r\nillustration, that a water power, whose theoretical power is ten\r\nhorsepower, is required to drive a power machine at a distance, the\r\nefficiencies and losses will be somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n    Waterwheel,   efficiency 80%,  Loss 20%,  generates  8.0 horsepower.\r\n    Connections,      “      95%,   “    5%,  transfers  7.6     “\r\n    Dynamo,           “      90%,   “   10%,  generates  6.8     “\r\n    Transmission,     “      90%,   “   10%,  transmits  6.2     “\r\n    Motor,            “      90%,   “   10%,  develops   5.5     “\r\n    Connections,      “      95%,   “    5%,  delivers   5.0     “\r\n\r\nTherefore, only five horsepower would be actually delivered to the\r\nmachine to be driven. This amounts to only half of the theoretical\r\npower of the falling water which is actually realized in useful work\r\nof the machine being driven. If the power from the waterwheel is to\r\nbe applied directly without generating electricity a much higher\r\nefficiency will be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the State Water Supply Commission and the writer, grateful\r\nacknowledgment is made to the following named persons who have extended\r\ncourtesies to me by furnishing information or illustrations for use in\r\nconnection with the preparation of this pamphlet:\r\n\r\n    Mr. E.
