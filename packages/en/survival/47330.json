opinion that the various\r\nphenomena which go to form what we call “weather” are “measurable at\r\nany place, and that having these measurements at _various_ places over\r\na given area, such as the British Isles, we ought to be able to foresee\r\nthe peculiar results as regards the direction and force of air currents\r\nwhich have their distinctive weather characteristics in relation to\r\ntemperature, rainfall, and electrical manifestations.”\r\n\r\nA conviction of the soundness of this opinion has induced the writer to\r\nmake the present compilation, in the hope that many who have hitherto\r\navoided the subject of meteorology and the weather may find interesting\r\nmatter, where before all seemed dull and technical.\r\n\r\nAny attempt at rigid mathematical accuracy is disclaimed at the outset;\r\nthe leading principles involved in weather forecasting and storm\r\nprevision will, however, be stated in a sufficiently definite manner to\r\ndivest the subject of the mystery in which it has hitherto seemed to be\r\nenshrined, and thus enable the unscientific reader to become\r\nweather-wise, and casual observers to note weather phenomena with some\r\ndegree of method and precision.\r\n\r\nOn page 4 will be found a list of works which have proved useful aids\r\nin making the present compilation. The writer desires to acknowledge\r\nhis indebtedness to the various authors and publishers, and especially\r\nto Mr. Strachan, for permission to quote from his able pamphlet on\r\n“Weather Forecasts, and Storm Prevision,” and to reproduce the valuable\r\ntable on page 37, for Calculating Heights of Mountains, from the fourth\r\nedition of his handy “Pocket Meteorological Register.”\r\n\r\nThe publication of Weather Reports in the daily journals must have\r\nconvinced the most indifferent that much greater importance is now\r\nattached to weather phenomena than formerly; and this conviction will\r\nbe deepened when it is remembered that a Parliamentary grant of £10,000\r\nis annually expended in support of the Meteorological Office and its\r\nseven fully organized observatories in this country, while America\r\nexpends no less a sum than £80,000 annually in the pursuit of weather\r\nwisdom; and the leading nations of Europe have also established\r\nmeteorological observatories in suitable localities.\r\n\r\nThe balloon ascents of Messrs. Glaisher and Coxwell attracted much\r\nattention to the instruments used in estimating atmospheric phenomena,\r\nand awakened a desire to know something of the functions of a\r\nbarometer, thermometer, hygrometer, &c., and especially of the\r\nclassification of those important weather-warners, clouds. These\r\nsubjects will be found duly noted in their order, and every phenomenon\r\nbeing traced to its source, Solar Radiation, it is hoped that these\r\npages may prove generally acceptable, and be deemed not altogether\r\nunworthy of\r\n\r\n                                             “THE CLERK OF THE WEATHER.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WEATHER WARNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two great Forces of Nature are Gravitation and Heat, which always\r\nact in opposition to each other.\r\n\r\nWEATHER is the result of the action of these forces on matter, and\r\nwhere one form of force is in excess of another, changes are produced\r\nwhich become apparent to our senses, or are indicated by suitable\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nTHE MATTER composing the earth on which we live is of three\r\nkinds—solid, liquid, and gaseous.\r\n\r\nTHE FORCE incessantly acting on these is the radiant heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS of this incessant action are:—\r\n\r\n    1. CALORIFICATION, or Heating, which, besides being appreciable by\r\n        our senses, is indicated by the THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\n    2. EVAPORATION, which alters the weight of the air indirectly, by\r\n        the diffusion of aqueous vapour through it. This alteration of\r\n        _weight_ is indicated by the BAROMETER, the accompanying\r\n        increase of moisture being indicated by the HYGROMETER.\r\n\r\n    3. RAREFACTION, which alters the _weight_ of the air directly.\r\n\r\n    4. CONDENSATION, producing fog, dew, rain, hail, and snow; all\r\n        sufficiently apparent when they occur, but estimated accurately\r\n        only by the Rain Gauge, or PLUVIOMETER.\r\n\r\n    5. MOTION, producing winds, which we are able to appreciate in the\r\n        gentle breeze and the awful cyclone, the force and velocity of\r\n        which are indicated by the ANEMOMETER.\r\n\r\n    6. ELECTRIFICATION, producing lightning, thunder, magnetic\r\n        phenomena, and chemical change, respectively indicated by the\r\n        ELECTROMETER, MAGNETOMETER, and OZONOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I.—CALORIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore considering in detail these results of the action of solar\r\nradiation on our globe, an attempt to realize the immensity of this\r\nstupendous force will materially aid in the general comprehension of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a sphere somewhat less than 8,000 miles in diameter; and\r\nif we assume, with the gifted author[1] of “The Phenomena of\r\nRadiation,”—“that it is about 91,300,000 miles from the sun, and moves\r\naround it in a slightly elliptical orbit, occupying rather more than\r\n365 days; that its shape is globular, somewhat flattened at its two\r\nextremities; that it rotates upon its own axis in the space of 24\r\nhours, that axis being inclined to the annual orbit at an angle of\r\n23-1/2—if we further assume that solar radiation is of such kind and\r\nquantity as it is, we are enabled to account for the total amount of\r\nlight and heat the earth receives, for the superior temperature and\r\nillumination of equatorial regions, as compared with polar, with the\r\ngradations of intermediate zones, for the alternation of day and night,\r\nand the annual progression of the seasons.\r\n\r\n [Footnote 1: George Warington, F.C.S.]\r\n\r\n“The actuating force of every wind that blows; of every mighty current\r\nthat streams through ocean depths; the motive cause of every particle\r\nof vapour in the air of every mist and cloud and raindrop, is SOLAR\r\nRADIATION.\r\n\r\n“The delicate tremor of the sun’s surface particles, shot hither\r\nthrough thirty million leagues of fine intangible æther, has power to\r\nraise whole oceans from their beds, and pour them down again upon the\r\nearth. We are apt to measure solar heat merely by the sensation it\r\nproduces on our skin, and think it small and weak accordingly; a good\r\ncoal fire will heat us more. But its true measure is the work it does.\r\nJudged by this standard, its immensity is overpowering. To take a\r\nsingle instance: the average fall of dew in England is about five\r\ninches annually; for the evaporation of the vapour necessary to produce\r\nthis trifling depth of moisture, there is expended _daily_ an amount of\r\nheat equal to the combustion of sixty-eight tons of coal for _every\r\nsquare mile_ of surface, or, for the whole of England, 4,000,000 tons.\r\nCompare now the size of England with that of the whole earth—only\r\n1/3388th part; extend the calculation to _rain_, as well as dew, the\r\naverage fall of which on the whole earth is estimated at five feet\r\nannually, or _twelve_ times greater; and then estimate the sum of\r\n4,000,000 × 3,388 × 12 = 162,624,000,000 tons, or about 3,000 times as\r\nmuch as is annually raised in the whole world; and we have the number\r\nof tons of coal required to produce the heat expended by the sun merely\r\nin raising vapour from the sea to give us rain during a single day.”\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 1.\r\n Pouillet’s Pyrheliometer. Scale about 1/8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SOLAR RADIATION.\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that solar radiation plays so important a part in the\r\nproduction of the natural phenomena classed under the head of\r\nMeteorology, a description of the mode of estimating its amount will\r\nprove interesting, and enable the reader to realize the existence of\r\nthis mighty power. M. Pouillet devised for this purpose the apparatus\r\nknown as the PYRHELIOMETER, which registers the power of parallel solar\r\nrays by the amount of heat imparted to a disc of a given diameter in a\r\ngiven time. It consists of a flat circular vessel of steel A having its\r\noutside coated with lamp-black B. A short steel tube is attached to the\r\nside opposite to that covered with lamp-black, and the vessel is filled\r\nwith mercury. A registering thermometer C, protected by a brass tube D,\r\nis then attached, and the whole is inverted and exposed to the sun, as\r\nshown at Fig. 1. The purpose of the second disc, E, is to aid in so\r\nplacing the apparatus that it shall receive direct parallel rays. It is\r\nobvious that if the shadow of the upper disc completely covers the\r\nlower one, the sun’s rays must be perpendicular to its blackened\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n“The surface on which the sun’s rays here fall is known; the quantity\r\nof mercury within the cylinder is also known; hence we can express the\r\neffect of the sun’s heat upon a given area by stating that it is\r\ncompetent, in five minutes, to raise so much mercury so many degrees in\r\ntemperature.”[2]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 2: Tyndall, “Heat a Mode of Motion.”]\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel also designed an instrument for observing the heating\r\npower of the sun’s rays in a given time, to which the title Actinometer\r\nis given. It consists of a Thermometer with a long open scale and a\r\nlarge cylindrical bulb, thus combining the best conditions for extreme\r\nsensibility. An observation is made by exposing the instrument in the\r\nshade for one minute and noting the temperature. It is then exposed to\r\nthe sun’s rays for one minute, and a record of the temperature made. It\r\nis again placed in the shade for one minute, and the mean of the two\r\nshade readings being deducted from the solar reading shows the heating\r\npower of the sun’s rays for one minute of time.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 2.\r\n Herschel’s Actinometer. Scale about 1/8.]\r\n\r\nThe stimulus imparted to the study of this class of phenomena by the\r\npublications of Professor Tyndall’s researches on Radiant Heat has\r\ninduced a demand among Meteorologists for instruments capable of\r\nyielding more available indications than those just described. This\r\ndemand has been most efficiently supplied by the ingenuity of\r\nscientists and instrument makers.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 3.\r\n Improved Solar Radiation Thermometer in Vacuo.\r\n Scale about 1/3.]\r\n\r\nThe early form of Solar Radiation Thermometer was a self-registering\r\nmaximum thermometer, with blackened bulb, having its graduated _stem_,\r\nonly, enclosed in an outer tube. Errors arising from terrestrial\r\nradiation and the _variable_ cooling influences of aërial currents are\r\nall obviated in the improved and patented Solar Radiation Thermometer\r\nshown at Fig. 3, which consists of a self-registering maximum\r\nthermometer, having its _bulb and stem_ dull-blackened, in accordance\r\nwith the suggestion of the Rev. F. W. Stow, and the _whole_ enclosed in\r\nan outer chamber of glass, from which the air has been completely\r\nexhausted. The perfection of the vacuum in the enclosing chamber is\r\nproved by the production of a pale white phosphorescent light, with\r\nfaint stratification and transverse bands when tested by the spark from\r\na Ruhmkorff coil. Due provision is made for this by the attachment of\r\nplatinum wires to the lower side of the tube, and when tested by a\r\nsyphon pressure gauge, the vacua have been proved to exist to within\r\n1/50th of an inch of pressure. It will thus be seen that the\r\nindications are preserved from errors arising from atmospheric\r\ncurrents, and from the absorption of heat by aqueous or other vapours,\r\nthe whole of the solar heat passing through the vacuum direct to the\r\nblackened bulb. The contained mercury expanding, carries the recording\r\nindex to the highest point, and thus is obtained a registration of the\r\nmaximum amount of solar radiation during the twenty-four hours. The\r\ngreat advantage accruing from the high degree of perfection to which\r\nthis instrument has been brought is, _uniformity_ of construction,\r\nwhich renders the observations made at different stations\r\n_intercomparable_. An enlarged view of the thermometer is given at Fig.\r\n3, showing the platinum wire terminations, whereby the vacuum is\r\ntested. The Rev. Fenwick W. Stow thus directs the manner in which the\r\nsolar radiation thermometer should be used:—\r\n\r\n1. Place the instrument four feet above the ground, in an open space,\r\nFig. 4, with its bulb directed towards the S.E. It is necessary that\r\nthe globular part of the external glass should not be placed in contact\r\nwith or very near to any substance, but that the air should circulate\r\nround it freely. Thus placed, its readings will be affected only by\r\ndirect sunshine and by the temperature of the air.\r\n\r\n2. One of the most convenient ways of fixing the instrument will be to\r\nallow its stem to fit into and rest upon two wooden collars fastened\r\nacross the ends of a narrow slip of board, which is nailed in its\r\ncentre upon a post steadied by lateral supports (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n3. The maximum temperature of the air in shade should be taken by a\r\nthermometer placed on a stand in an open situation. Any stand which\r\nthoroughly screens it from the sun, and exposes it to a free\r\ncirculation of air, will do for the purpose.\r\n\r\n4. The difference between the maxima in sun and shade, thus taken, is a\r\nmeasure of the amount of solar radiation.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 4.\r\n Solar Radiation Thermometer, black bulb and\r\n stem in vacuo, on 4 feet stand.\r\n Scale about 1/20.]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable phenomenon recently discovered by Mr. Crookes, in which\r\nlight is apparently converted into motion, has, at the suggestion of\r\nMr. Strachan, received an interesting application to meteorology. The\r\narrangement is shown at Fig. 5, where a Solar Radiation Thermometer has\r\na Crookes’ Radiometer attached to it, which, in addition to forming an\r\nefficient test as to the perfection of the vacuum, will, it is hoped,\r\naid in eventually establishing a relation between intensity of\r\nradiation, as shown by the thermometer, and the number of revolutions\r\nof the radiometer. The instrument has so recently been devised that any\r\npositive statement as to its usefulness would be premature; it may,\r\nhowever, prove a valuable auxiliary to the solar thermometer, and\r\neventually be so far improved as to become a more definite exponent of\r\nsolar radiation than the thermometer.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 5.\r\n Radio-Solar Thermometer. Scale about 1/4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TERRESTRIAL RADIATION.\r\n\r\nIt is an established fact, confirmed by careful experiments, that a\r\nmutual interchange of heat is constantly going on between all bodies\r\nfreely exposed to view of each other, thus tending to establish a state\r\nof equilibrium. It has further been ascertained that, as the mean\r\ntemperature of the earth remains unchanged, “it necessarily follows\r\nthat it emits by radiation from and through the surface of its\r\natmosphere, on an average, the exact amount of heat it receives from\r\nthe sun.” This process commences _slowly_ at sunset, and proceeds with\r\ngreat rapidity at and after midnight, attaining its maximum effect in a\r\nlong night, in perfect calm, under a cloudless sky, resulting in the\r\ncondensation of vapour in the form of dew, or hoar-frost, when the\r\ntemperature of the surface-air is reduced to the dew-point.[3]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 3: See page 47.]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which heat thus escapes by radiation under varying\r\nconditions of sky is measured by a Self-registering Terrestrial Minimum\r\nThermometer, the bulb of which is placed over short grass, and “a\r\nthermometer so exposed under a clear sky always marks several degrees\r\nbelow the temperature of the air, and its depression affords a rude\r\nmeasure of the facility for the escape of heat afforded under the\r\ncircumstances of exposure.”[4]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 4: Herschel.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 6.\r\n Terrestrial Radiation Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/6.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 7.\r\n Improved Cylinder Jacket Terrestrial Minimum Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/12.]\r\n\r\nFig. 6 shows the ordinary spherical bulb thermometer employed for this\r\npurpose, and Fig. 7 the improved Cylinder Jacket Thermometer, which, by\r\nexposing a larger surface of spirit to the air, gives an instrument\r\npossessing an amount of sensibility in no way inferior to that of\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nThere is a drawback to the use of these thermometers enclosed in outer\r\ntubes, arising from moisture getting into the outer cylinder or jacket,\r\nand frequently preventing the observer from reading the thermometer.\r\nThis has recently been removed by making a perfectly ground joint of\r\nglass (analogous to a glass stopper in a bottle) as a substitute for\r\nthe old form of packing at the open end of the tube, the other end\r\nbeing fused into contact with the outer cylinder to keep it in its\r\nplace. The intrusion and condensation of moisture thus becomes\r\nimpossible, while the scale is protected from corrosion or abrasion.\r\nThis “ground socket” arrangement is shown at Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 8.\r\n Ground Socket Minimum Thermometer. Scale about 1/4.]\r\n\r\nRadiation from the earth upwards proceeds with great rapidity under a\r\ncloudless sky, but a passing cloud, or the presence even of invisible\r\naqueous vapour in the air, is sufficient to effect a marked\r\nretardation, as is beautifully illustrated by Sir John Leslie’s\r\nÆthrioscope, shown at Fig. 9, which consists of a vertical glass tube,\r\nhaving a bore so fine that a little coloured liquid is supported in it\r\nby the mere force of cohesion. Each end of the tube terminates in a\r\nglass bulb containing air. A scale, having its zero in the middle, is\r\nattached to the tube, and the bulb A is enclosed in a highly polished\r\nsphere of brass. The upper bulb B is blackened, and placed in the\r\ncentre of a highly-gilt and polished metallic cup, having a movable\r\ncover F. These outer metallic coverings protect the bulbs from\r\nextraneous sources of heat. So long as the upper bulb is covered, the\r\nliquid in the tube stands at zero on the scale, but immediately on its\r\nremoval radiation commences, the air contained in B contracts, while\r\nthe elasticity of that contained in A forces the liquid up the tube to\r\na height directly proportionate to the rapidity of the radiation.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 9.\r\n Æthrioscope.\r\n Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SHADE TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nSelf-registering Maximum Thermometers are made in two ways. In the\r\nfirst, the index is a small portion of the mercurial column separated\r\nfrom it by a minute air bubble. The noontide heat expands the mercury,\r\nand the subsequent contraction as the temperature decreases affects\r\nonly that portion of the mercury in connection with the bulb, leaving\r\nthe disconnected portion to register the maximum temperature. In the\r\nsecond form the tube is ingeniously contracted just outside the bulb,\r\nso that the mercury extruded from the bulb by expansion cannot return\r\nby the mere force of cohesion, but remains to register the highest\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 10.\r\n Self-registering Maximum Thermometer. Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nThere is a modification of this latter form produced by the addition of\r\na supplementary chamber just outside the bulb and _over_ the column,\r\nfrom which, as expansion proceeds, the mercury flows by gravitation,\r\nbut into which it cannot return until, as in the other forms, the\r\ninstrument is readjusted for a new observation, by unhooking the bulb\r\nend and lowering it until the mercury flows into its place.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 11.\r\n Self-registering Minimum Thermometer. Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nSelf-registering Minimum Thermometers are of two kinds,—spirit and\r\nmercurial. Fig. 12 shows one of Rutherford’s Alcohol Minimum\r\nThermometers, which will be seen to consist of a bulb and tube attached\r\nto a scale, which latter may be either of wood, glass, or metal. The\r\ntube contains an index of black glass.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 12.\r\n Self-registering Minimum Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nThe Thermometer is “set” for observation by slightly raising the bulb\r\nend until the index slides to the extreme end of the column of spirit.\r\nIt is then suspended in the shade with the bulb end a little lower than\r\nthe other. The contraction of the spirit consequent on a fall of\r\ntemperature draws the index back, but a subsequent expansion does not\r\ncarry it forward, it remains at the lowest point to which the spirit\r\nhas contracted to register the minimum temperature. A very useful\r\nmodification of this instrument is made for gardeners and general\r\nhorticultural purposes, in which the scale is of cast zinc with raised\r\nfigures, which being filed off flush after the whole has been painted\r\nof a dark colour are easily legible at a little distance.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of alcohol for the indication of _very_ low temperatures\r\nis that it has never been frozen.[5]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 5: Mercury freezes at -39° F.]\r\n\r\nFig. 13 shows a set of Maximum and Minimum and Wet and Dry Bulb\r\nThermometers, with incorrodible porcelain scales, suspended on a\r\nmahogany screen. Instruments of this quality are generally\r\nengine-divided on the stem, and if, in addition to this, they are\r\nverified by comparison with standard instruments at the Kew\r\nObservatory, they may be regarded as standards, and employed for\r\naccurate scientific observations.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 13.\r\n Standard Set of Instruments on Screen. Scale about 1/6.]\r\n\r\nSix’s Self-registering Thermometer consists of a long tubular bulb,\r\nunited to a smaller tube more than twice its length, and bent twice,\r\nlike a syphon, so that the larger tube is in the centre, while the\r\nsmaller one terminates at the top, on the right hand, in a pear-shaped\r\nbulb, as shown in the cut (Fig. 14). This bulb, and the tube in\r\nconnection with it, are partly filled with spirit; the long central\r\nbulb and its connecting tube are completely filled, while the lower\r\nportion of the syphon is filled with mercury. A steel index, prevented\r\nfrom falling by a hair tied round it, to act as a spring, moves in the\r\nspirit in each of the side tubes. The scale on the left hand has the\r\nzero at the top, and that on the right at the bottom. When setting the\r\ninstrument, the indices are brought into contact with the mercury by\r\npassing a small magnet down the outside of each tube. Then, should a\r\nrise of temperature take place, the spirit in the central bulb expands,\r\nforcing down the mercury in the left hand tube and causing it to rise\r\nin the right, and _vice versa_ for a diminution of temperature.\r\n\r\nIt should be always used and carried upright, and the indices should be\r\ndrawn _gently_ down by the magnet into contact with the mercury; and,\r\nwhen a reading is taken, the ends of the indices nearest the mercury\r\nindicate the maximum and minimum temperatures which have been attained\r\nduring the stated hours of observation.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 14.\r\n Six’s Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nSix’s form of thermometer has been extensively used for ascertaining\r\ndeep sea temperatures.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 15.\r\n Deep Sea Maximum\r\n and Minimum Registering\r\n Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nEvaporation and the mechanical action of winds keep up a constant\r\ncirculating motion of the ocean, the currents of which tend to equalize\r\ntemperature. The most important of these is known as the Gulf Stream,\r\ntaking its name from the Gulf of Mexico, out of which it flows at a\r\nvelocity sometimes of five miles an hour, and in a width of not less\r\nthan fifty miles. It has an important effect on the climate of Great\r\nBritain, and of all lands subject to its influence, its temperature as\r\nit leaves the Gulf of Mexico being 85° F., diminishing to 75° off the\r\ncoast of Labrador, and still further as it nears northern latitudes.\r\nObservations on the temperature of the ocean are therefore included in\r\nthe scope of meteorology, and are ascertained by the use of\r\nthermometers of special construction (Fig. 15). In the earlier\r\nexperiments made for ascertaining the temperature of the ocean at a\r\ndepth of 15,000 feet, where the pressure is equal to three tons on the\r\nsquare inch, it was found that a considerable error occurred in the\r\nindications in consequence of this enormous pressure; accordingly the\r\ncentral elongated bulb of the ordinary Six’s Thermometer (see page 19)\r\nis shortened and enclosed in an outer bulb nearly filled with spirit,\r\nwhich, while effectually relieving the thermometer bulb from undue\r\npressure, allows any change to be at once transmitted to it, and thus\r\nsecures the registration of the exact temperature. The arrangement\r\npossesses the further advantage of making the instrument stronger, more\r\ncompact, and more capable of resisting such comparatively rough\r\ntreatment as it would receive on board ship.\r\n\r\nThe honour of constructing the first thermometer, which was an Air and\r\nSpirit Thermometer, is ascribed to Galileo; it assumed a practical\r\nshape in 1620, at the hands of Drebel, a Dutch physician. Hailey\r\nsubstituted mercury for spirit in 1697; Réaumur improved the instrument\r\nin 1730, and Fahrenheit in 1749. More recently the instrument has been\r\nperfected by the scales being graduated on the actual stem of the\r\ninstrument. For many years it was exclusively used by chemists and men\r\nof science; it afterwards received numerous applications in the arts\r\nand manufactures; and is now considered an essential in every household.\r\n\r\nThermometers are instruments for measuring temperature by the\r\ncontraction or expansion of fluids in enclosed tubes. The tubes, which\r\nare of glass, have spherical, cylindrical, or spiral bulbs blown on to\r\none end; they have also an exceedingly fine bore, and when mercury or\r\nspirit is enclosed in them these fluids, in contracting and expanding\r\nwith variations of temperature, indicate degrees of heat in relation to\r\ntwo fixed points—viz., the freezing and boiling points of water. Care\r\nis taken to exclude all air before sealing, so that the upper portion\r\nof the tube inside shall be a perfect vacuum, and thus offer no\r\nresistance to the free expansion of the mercury. In graduating, or\r\ndividing the scales, the points at which the mercury remains stationary\r\nin melting ice and boiling water are first marked on the stem, and the\r\nintervening space divided into as many equal parts as are necessary to\r\nconstitute the scales of Fahrenheit, Réaumur, or Celsius, the last\r\nbeing known as the Centigrade (_hundred steps_) scale, from the\r\ncircumstance of the space between the freezing and boiling points of\r\nwater being divided into one hundred equal parts (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 16.\r\n Comparison of Thermometer\r\n Scales.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 17.\r\n “Legible”\r\n Scale Thermometer.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nGRADUATION OF THERMOMETERS.—When the fluid (either mercury or spirit)\r\nhas been enclosed in the hermetically sealed tube, it becomes\r\nnecessary, in order that its indications may be comparable with those\r\nof other instruments, that a scale having at least two fixed points\r\nshould be attached to it. As it has been found that the temperature of\r\nmelting ice or freezing water is always constant, the height at which\r\nthe fluid _rests_ in a mixture of ice and water has been chosen as one\r\npoint from which to graduate the scale. It has been also found that\r\nwith the barometer at 29·905 the boiling-point of water is also\r\nconstant, and when a thermometer is immersed in pure distilled water\r\nheated to ebullition, the point at which the mercury remains immovable\r\nis, like the freezing-point, carefully marked, the tube is then\r\ncalibrated and divided as shown in Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nThe zero of the scales of Réaumur and Centigrade is the freezing-point\r\nof water, marked, in each case, 0°, while the intervening space, up to\r\nthe boiling-point of water, is divided, in the former case, into 80\r\nparts, and in the latter to 100°.\r\n\r\nIn the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing-point is represented at 32°, and\r\nthe boiling-point at 212°, the intervening space being divided into\r\n180°, which admits of extension above and below the points named, a\r\ngood thermometer being available for temperature up to 620° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Réaumur scale is confined almost exclusively to Russia\r\nand the north of Germany, while the Centigrade scale is used throughout\r\nthe rest of Europe. The Fahrenheit scale is confined to England and her\r\ncolonies, and to the United States of America.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 18.\r\n Gridiron-bulb\r\n Thermometer.\r\n Scale\r\n about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nCircumstances sometimes arise in which it becomes necessary to convert\r\nreadings from one scale into those of the others, according to the\r\nfollowing rules:—\r\n\r\n    1. To convert Centigrade degrees into degrees of Fahrenheit,\r\n        multiply by 9, divide the product by 5, and add 32.\r\n\r\n    2. To convert Fahrenheit degrees into degrees of Centigrade,\r\n        subtract 32, multiply by 5, and divide by 9.\r\n\r\n    3. To convert Réaumur degrees into degrees of Fahrenheit, multiply\r\n        by 9, divide by 4, and add 32.[6]\r\n\r\n    4. To convert Réaumur degrees into degrees of Centigrade, multiply\r\n        by 5 and divide by 4.[7]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 6: 8 R = 50 F.]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 7: 8 R = 10 C.]\r\n\r\nFor the production of _continuous_ records, the Meteorological\r\nCommittee of the Royal Society have adopted an instrument called a\r\nThermograph, or self-recording wet and dry bulb thermometer, which is\r\nlargely aided by photography. The bulbs of the thermometers are\r\nnecessarily placed in the open air, and at a suitable distance from any\r\nwall or other radiating surface; the tubes are of sufficient length to\r\nadmit of their being brought inside the building, in due proximity to\r\nthe recording apparatus placed in a chamber from which daylight is\r\nrigidly excluded.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 19.\r\n Thermograph and Self-recording Hygrometer.\r\n Scale about 1/18.]\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions in such an apparatus are:—1. A means of\r\ndenoting the height of the mercurial column in the stem of a\r\nthermometer in relation to a fixed horizontal line. 2. A time scale\r\ndenoting the exact moment at which the atmosphere reached the\r\ntemperature indicated by the mark. 3. As the marks are produced\r\nchemically, and not mechanically (as in the Anemograph), a _dark_ room.\r\n\r\nA description of the drawing on page 23 will best show how very\r\nefficiently, through the ingenuity of Mr. BECKLEY, these conditions\r\nhave been obtained:—S, wet bulb thermometer; T, atmospheric\r\nthermometer; B, screw for adjusting thermometers; C C, paraffin lamps\r\nor gaslights; D D, condensers, concentrating the light on the mirrors R\r\nR; R R, mirrors reflecting light through air-speck in thermometers V V;\r\nE E, slits through which light passes from mirrors R R; F F,\r\nphotographic lenses, producing image of air-speck from both\r\nthermometers on cylinder G; G, revolving cylinder or drum carrying\r\nphotographic paper; H, clock, turning cylinder G round once in 48\r\nhours; I, shutter to intercept light four minutes every two hours;\r\nleaving white time-line on developing latent image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            II.—EVAPORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolar heat rarefies the air by driving its particles asunder; it also\r\nvaporises water from the surface of river, lake, and ocean, diffusing\r\nthe vapour through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nGreat interest attaches to the subject of Evaporation, on account of\r\nits connection with rainfall and water supply. It is to be regretted,\r\ntherefore, that the results hitherto obtained in the endeavour to\r\nmeasure its rate and quantity do not merit much confidence as regards\r\ntheir applicability to the evaporation occurring in nature, owing to\r\nthe exceptional manner in which the observations have been made.\r\n\r\nThere is this uncertainty about evaporation, that all the experiments\r\nrelate to that taking place from an exposed water surface of a,\r\ncomparatively speaking, infinitesimally small area, and can therefore\r\nhave but a very partial applicability to the conditions occurring in\r\nnature. There are two main reasons for this statement. Firstly, the\r\nproportion of the surface of the land on the earth which is covered\r\nwith lakes and rivers is very limited, and the experiments above\r\nindicated throw no light on the evaporation from the soil. Secondly,\r\nthe evaporation from the surface of a small atmometer erected on the\r\nground, with comparatively dry air all around it, is certainly very\r\ndifferent from that which would take place from an equal area in the\r\ncentre of a large water surface, such as a lake.\r\n\r\nIt is of course easy to make experiments on the evaporation from the\r\nsoil by means of a balance atmometer, but in order that these should\r\npossess a practical value, the investigation must be extended so as to\r\ninclude a wide variety of soils, &c., &c. As regards the second point\r\nwhich has been raised, it is recommended by the Vienna Congress to\r\nerect atmometers in the centre of water surfaces; but it is not a very\r\neasy matter to conduct such experiments with accuracy, owing to the\r\nrisk of in-splashing from waves.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 20.\r\n Atmidometer.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nBABINGTON’S ATMIDOMETER measures evaporation from water, ice, or snow,\r\nand in form resembles a hydrometer, with the difference that the stem\r\nbears a scale graduated to grains and half grains, and is surmounted by\r\na light, shallow copper pan. When in use, the hydrometer-like\r\ninstrument is immersed in a glass vessel having a hole in the cover,\r\nthrough which the stem protrudes. The copper pan is then placed on the\r\ntop, and sufficient water, ice, or snow placed therein to sink the stem\r\nto the zero of the scale. As the evaporation proceeds, the stem rises;\r\nand, if the _time_ of commencing the experiment is noted, the rate as\r\nwell as the amount of evaporation is indicated in grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           III.—RAREFACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of aqueous vapour through the air and the rarefying\r\ninfluence of heat jointly effect an alteration in the weight of the\r\natmosphere. This alteration of _weight_ is determined by the Barometer,\r\nan instrument invented by TORRICELLI, in 1643, and in so perfect a form\r\nthat in its essential features it has not been superseded.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 21. and 22.\r\n Construction of Barometer.\r\n Scale about 1/18.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of construction is illustrated by Figs. 21 and 22. It consists\r\nin hermetically sealing a glass tube about three feet long and filling\r\nit with mercury. The finger is placed over the open end of the tube,\r\nwhich is then inverted and placed in a cistern of mercury and the\r\nfinger withdrawn. The left-hand figure shows the result; the mercury is\r\nseen to fall some three or four inches, leaving an empty space at the\r\ntop of the tube, which is called the “Torricellian vacuum.”\r\n\r\nThe mercury is prevented from falling lower than is shown, by the\r\nexternal pressure of the atmosphere on the cistern. The _weight_ of\r\nthis column, therefore, represents the _weight_ or pressure of a\r\ncorresponding column of air many miles in height; and so close is the\r\nrelation between the column of mercury and the external air that the\r\n_height_ of the former changes with the slightest variation in the\r\n_weight_ of the latter, and the instrument thus becomes a measure of\r\nthe weight of the air, from which property its name is derived, the\r\nGreek words _baros_ and _metron_ signifying respectively “weight” and\r\n“measure.”\r\n\r\nWhen the mercury in the barometer tube falls, that in the cistern rises\r\nin corresponding proportion, and _vice versa_, so that there is an\r\never-varying relation between the _level_ of the mercury in the tube\r\nand the mercury in the cistern, which affects the accuracy of the\r\nreadings. In M. Fortin’s cistern this difficulty is obviated by the use\r\nof a glass, with flexible leather bottom and a brass adjusting screw,\r\nas shown in the cut. Through the top of the cistern is inserted a small\r\nivory point, the lower end of which corresponds with the zero of the\r\nscale; and, to secure uniformity, the level of the mercury in the\r\ncistern should be adjusted by the screw at each observation, until the\r\nivory point _appears_ to touch its own reflection on the surface. The\r\nreading is then taken.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 23.\r\n Fortin’s\r\n Cistern.\r\n Scale about\r\n 1/6.]\r\n\r\nIn making barometric observations for comparison with others, it is\r\nnecessary that all should be reduced to the common temperature of 32°\r\nF., and for this purpose tables have been calculated which will be\r\nfound to save much time.\r\n\r\nTables also for reducing observations of the barometer to sea level, an\r\noperation equally indispensable with the other corrections to make the\r\nreadings intercomparable, have been published by direction of the\r\nMeteorological Committee.\r\n\r\nFor the British Isles the mean sea-level at Liverpool has been selected\r\nby the Ordnance Survey as their datum, and the height of any station\r\nmay be ascertained by first noting the nearest Ordnance Bench Mark thus\r\n↑, and purchasing that portion of the Ordnance map which includes the\r\nstation, near to which the Bench Mark will be found with the height\r\nabove sea-level duly entered. The levellings made for railways will\r\nalso furnish the desired information. Failing both these, the observer\r\nshould select two or more of the stations nearest his locality for\r\nwhich official Meteorological Reports are published daily in the\r\n_Times_ and other journals; and taking observations of his barometer at\r\n8 a.m., for a few weeks, should compare them with the mean of the\r\nobservations at those stations. The comparison should be omitted when\r\nthe barometer pressure is not steady.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 24.\r\n Error of\r\n Capillarity.\r\n Scale about 1/2.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 25. Standard Barometer. Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nA Standard Barometer is constructed on FORTIN’S principle, and should\r\nhave its tube about half an inch bore, enclosed in a brass body having\r\nat its upper end two vertical openings, in which the vernier works. The\r\nmercury is seen through these openings, aided by light reflected from a\r\nwhite opaque glass reflector let into the mahogany board behind. The\r\nscale is divided on one side into English inches and 20ths, and may\r\nhave on the other French millimetres, the vernier enabling a reading to\r\nbe taken, in each case respectively, of 1/500th of an inch and 1/10th\r\nof a millimetre. In making the instrument, the mercury is boiled in the\r\ntube, to ensure the complete exclusion of air and moisture; while\r\nFORTIN’S principle of cistern ensures a constant level from whence to\r\ntake the readings. A sensitive thermometer with scale, engine-divided\r\non stem, is attached to the brass mount, which is perforated to admit\r\nthe attenuated bulb of the thermometer into absolute contact with the\r\nglass tube of the barometer, to ensure its indicating the same\r\ntemperature as the contained mercury. The instrument is suspended by a\r\nring from a brass bracket attached to a mahogany board, and the lower\r\nend passes through a larger ring having three screws for adjusting it\r\nvertically.\r\n\r\nA “reading” is taken in the following manner:—1. Note the temperature\r\nby the attached thermometer. 2. Raise or lower the mercury in the\r\ncistern by turning the screw underneath until the reflected image of\r\nthe ivory point on the mercury _seems_ to be in contact with the ivory\r\nitself. By the milled head at the side, the vernier is adjusted until\r\nits lower edge just touches the top of the mercurial column, the scale\r\nand vernier then indicate the height of the barometer in inches, 10ths,\r\n100ths, and 1000ths.\r\n\r\nHigh-class instruments, such as that here described, yield _exact_\r\nreadings; but, in order to note them accurately, it is important that\r\nthe eye, the zero edge of the vernier, the top of the mercurial column,\r\nand the back of the vernier should be in the same horizontal plane;\r\nconditions which may be obtained after some practice.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows a form of barometer which, though\r\nnot much used in this country, is deservedly popular on the Continent\r\nas a standard station barometer. It is called a Syphon Barometer, and\r\nwas designed by Gay-Lussac. The open end of the tube is bent up in the\r\nform of a syphon, the short limb being from six to eight inches long;\r\nit is furnished with metal scales and verniers, and is mounted on a\r\nmahogany board with attached thermometer.\r\n\r\nThese barometers require no correction for capillarity or capacity,\r\neach surface of mercury being equally depressed by capillary\r\nattraction, and the quantity of mercury falling from the long limb\r\noccupies the same space in the short limb. The usual correction for\r\ntemperature must, however, be applied. A scale of inches, measured from\r\na zero point taken near the bend of the tube, furnishes the means of\r\nmeasuring the long and short columns. The difference of readings is the\r\nheight of the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe VERNIER is a movable scale for subdividing parts of a fixed scale,\r\nand was first applied to that purpose by its inventor, M. PIERRE\r\nVERNIER, in 1630. In the barometer the parts to be divided are inches,\r\nwhich by the aid of this invention are subdivided into 10ths, 100ths,\r\nand 1000ths.\r\n\r\nFig. 27 shows the scale of a standard barometer divided into 1/2-10ths,\r\nor ·05 of an inch. The Vernier C D is made equal to 24 of such\r\ndivisions, and is divided into 25 equal parts, from whence it follows\r\nthat one division on the scale is 1/25th of ·05 larger than one on the\r\nvernier, so that it shows a difference of ·002 of an inch. The vernier\r\nreads ·0, or zero, upwards; D, therefore, indicates the top of the\r\nmercurial column.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 26.\r\n Syphon\r\n Barometer.\r\n Scale\r\n about 1/12.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 27, zero on the vernier is exactly in line with 29 inches and\r\n5/10ths of the fixed scale; the reading, therefore, is 29·500 inches.\r\nThe vernier line _a_ falls short of a division of the scale by\r\n·002-inch; _b_, by ·004; _c_, by ·006; _d_, by ·008; and the succeeding\r\nline by ·010. If the vernier be adjusted to make _a_ coincide with _z_\r\non the scale, it will have moved through ·002-inch; and if 1 on the\r\nvernier be moved to coincide with _y_ on the scale, the space measured\r\nwill be ·010-inch. Consequently, the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on the\r\nvernier, measure 100ths, and the intermediate lines even 1000ths of an\r\ninch. In Fig. 28 the zero of the vernier is between 29·65 and 29·70 on\r\nthe scale. Glancing up the vernier and scale, the second line above 3\r\nwill be found in a direct line with one on the scale; this gives ·03\r\nand ·004 to add to 29·65, so that the actual reading is 29·684. In\r\nthose instances where no line on the vernier is found _precisely_ to\r\ncoincide with a line on the scale, and doubt arises as to which to\r\nselect from two equally coincident lines, the rule is to take the\r\nintermediate 1000th of an inch.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 27. and 28.\r\n The Vernier.]\r\n\r\nFor household and marine barometers such minute subdivisions of the\r\nscale are unnecessary, and the scales of such instruments are therefore\r\ndivided only to 10ths, and the verniers made only to read to 100ths of\r\nan inch, which is effected by making the vernier 9/10ths or 11/10ths of\r\nan inch long, and dividing it into 10 equal parts.\r\n\r\nIn “taking a reading” it is important that it should be done as quickly\r\nas possible, as the heat from the body and the hand is sufficient to\r\ninterfere with that accuracy which is necessary where the intention is\r\nto compare the readings with those made by other observers. This\r\nfacility is soon acquired by a little practice.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 29. Farmer’s Barometer. Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nPediment Household Barometers, though not so imposing in appearance as\r\nthe Wheel Barometer, yield direct readings without the intervention of\r\nthe mechanical appliances necessary for moving a needle over an\r\nextended dial. Their mountings are for the most part in oak, walnut,\r\nand other woods, the scales are of ivory, porcelain, or enamelled\r\nglass, and in their graduation due regard is paid to the relative\r\nproportions of cistern and tube, so that the conditions essential to\r\nthe production of a Standard Barometer are very closely attained. In\r\ncommon with other barometers, it should hang in the shade in a vertical\r\nposition, so that light may be seen through the tube. As a purchaser\r\nwould receive it in what is called a “portable” state, it will be\r\nnecessary on first suspending it to take the pinion key, fit it on the\r\nsquare-headed pin at the bottom of the instrument, and turn gently to\r\nthe left till the screw stops. The effect of this is to lower the base\r\nof the cistern, and allow the mercury in the tube to fall to its proper\r\nlevel. The key should then be replaced for use in moving the vernier.\r\nTo make this kind of Barometer portable for travelling it should be\r\nunhung, _very_ gradually sloped until the mercury is at the top of the\r\ntube, when, the instrument being upside down, the base of the cistern\r\nis screwed up by turning the pinion key gently to the right until it\r\nstops. Care should be taken to avoid concussion, and to have the\r\ncistern end always uppermost, or the instrument lying flat.\r\n\r\nFig. 29 shows a useful form of barometer for the farmer, combining as\r\nit does three instruments in one, for the thermometer on the right hand\r\nof the scale having its bulb covered with muslin kept moist by\r\ncommunication with a cistern of water enables the two thermometers to\r\nbe employed as a Hygrometer, the use of which is described at page 50.\r\nThis barometer should be suspended in a place where it will be exposed\r\nas much as possible to the external air, but not in sunshine.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 30.\r\n Wheel Barometer. Scale\r\n about 1/6.]\r\n\r\nIn Wheel Barometers the varying height of a column of mercury is shown\r\nby the movement of a needle on a divided circular dial, by adopting the\r\nsyphon form of barometer tube, concealed behind the dial and frame. An\r\niron or glass float sustained by the mercury in the open branch (Fig.\r\n31) is suspended by a counterbalance a _little_ lighter than itself.\r\nThe axis of the pulley has the needle attached to it, and consequently\r\nmoves the needle with the rise and fall of the mercury. It is obvious,\r\ntherefore, that if the atmospheric pressure increases the float falls\r\nand the needle turns to the right, and if it diminishes the needle\r\nturns in the opposite direction. The divisions on the scale represent\r\ninches, tenths, and hundredths in the rise and fall of a column of\r\nmercury, and these can be read with great facility, as one inch\r\noccupies the space of six or more on this very open scale, according to\r\nsize of dial (Fig. 30). The wording is arbitrary, and indicates the\r\n_probable_ weather that may be expected.\r\n\r\nImportant improvements have recently been effected in this form of\r\nhousehold barometers, so that they may be recommended as good weather\r\nindicators where facility of reading is a desideratum.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 31.\r\n Mechanism of Wheel\r\n Barometer.\r\n Scale about 1/8.]\r\n\r\nSince the more scientific “Pediment” has attained so high a degree of\r\npopularity, a certain amount of unmerited obloquy has attached itself\r\nto the Dial or Wheel Barometer invented by Dr. Hooke. It must be\r\nconceded that the standard form of pediment barometers in which the\r\nheight of the mercury is seen at a glance is more strictly an\r\n“instrument of precision,” but it should not be forgotten, although a\r\ndelicate mechanism intervenes between the mercury and the observer, it\r\nis so arranged that a tenth of an inch rise or fall causes a movement\r\nof the index over an inch of space.\r\n\r\nThe Aneroid Barometer indicates variations in atmospheric pressure by\r\nthe elevation and depression of the sides of an elastic metallic box\r\nfrom which the air is exhausted and which is kept from complete\r\ncollapse by a powerful spring. In cases where _extreme_ accuracy is not\r\nindispensable, the portability and sensibility of this instrument\r\nrecommend it for use by tourists and fishermen. It is “quick in showing\r\nthe variations of atmospheric pressure.”[8] “The Aneroid readings may\r\nbe safely depended upon.”[9] “Its movements are always consistent.”[10]\r\n“Atmospheric changes are indicated _first_ by the Aneroid.”[11] It is\r\nespecially adapted for determining mountain altitudes, some being\r\nfurnished with a scale of feet, enabling the observer to read off the\r\nheight by direct observation, and if adjusted once a year by comparison\r\nwith a mercurial standard is quite trustworthy.

The lamp is protected from wind by a perforated japanned\r\ntin case covered with wire gauze. When the boiler is charged and the\r\nlamp ignited the mercury ascends, and the point at which it becomes\r\nstationary shows the temperature, which will give the elevation in feet\r\nabove the sea-level on reference to the table supplied by the optician\r\nfrom whom the instrument is purchased.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 34.\r\n Barograph. Scale about 1/6.]\r\n\r\nA highly-refined automatic arrangement is adopted at some observatories\r\ncalled a Barograph, which, by the aid of photography, becomes a\r\nself-recording mercurial barometer. It is simpler in its arrangement\r\nthan the thermograph, and includes a clock of superior construction,\r\ncausing a cylinder bearing photographic paper to make one complete\r\nrevolution in forty-eight hours. A double combination of achromatic\r\nlenses brings to a focus rays passing through a slit placed in front of\r\nthe mercurial column, behind which is a strong gaslight or paraffin\r\nlamp, the rays of which are condensed upon the slit by a combination of\r\ntwo plano-convex lenses.\r\n\r\nAlthough a barometer is an instrument _artificially_ constructed by\r\nman, it should not be forgotten that when once made the column of\r\nmercury is placed in a passive or quiescent state in direct relation\r\nwith the great forces of nature, so that its indications become to some\r\nextent _natural_ phenomena. This is aptly illustrated by what is called\r\nthe “daily fluctuation” of the barometer which occurs in all countries,\r\nthough the hours and extent vary with the latitude, diminishing as the\r\nlatitude increases, according to a definite law. The phenomena does not\r\nadmit of a satisfactory explanation, but is doubtless connected with\r\nthe daily variations of temperature and of vapour in the air. The\r\nmercury falls _naturally_ (so to speak) from nine or ten to between\r\nthree and four p.m.; it then rises till between nine and ten p.m. It\r\nfalls again about four a.m., and rises again about ten a.m. It is\r\nusually highest at nine a.m. and nine p.m., and lowest at three a.m.\r\nand three p.m.\r\n\r\nThese natural elevations and depressions of the mercury should be\r\nallowed for in reading the barometer, as any rise or fall in opposition\r\nto the natural rise and fall possesses for that reason increased\r\nimportance. For instance, fine weather may be expected if the mercury\r\nrises between nine a.m. and three p.m.; in like manner rain may be\r\nexpected should a fall take place between three p.m. and nine p.m.\r\n\r\nIt will be inferred from the preceding facts that there are certain\r\nhours better suited for “taking a reading” than others. When one\r\nobservation only is made daily, noon is the best time, two observations\r\nshould be made at nine a.m. and nine p.m., and for three the best hours\r\nare nine a.m. (maximum), noon (mean), and three p.m. (minimum).\r\n\r\nThe opinion generally entertained that a high barometer is an\r\nindication of fine weather, and a low one a warning of bad weather, is\r\nopen to exception, and an increased value would attach to the\r\nindications of the instrument in proportion as the following points are\r\nnoted and allowed for:—\r\n\r\n1. The actual height of the mercury. 2. Whether it is rising or\r\nfalling. 3. The rate of rise and fall. 4. Whether the rise or fall has\r\nbeen long continued.\r\n\r\nThe state of the barometer foretells _coming_ weather, and when the\r\npresent weather disagrees with the barometer a change will soon take\r\nplace. A fall of half a tenth, or more, in an hour is a sure warning of\r\na storm, a rapid rise is a warning of unsettled weather.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is generally lowest with wind from the S.W., and highest\r\nwith wind N.E., or with a calm. N.E. and S.W. may be called the wind’s\r\npoles, and the difference of height due to _direction_ only from one of\r\nthese bearings to another amounts to about half an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BAROMETER PRECAUTIONS.\r\n\r\n   If vacuum suspected, cause mercury to strike top of tube.\r\n   A clear metallic “click” indicates a good vacuum.\r\n   A dull “thud” indicates air or moisture.\r\n   In latter case return to optician, but if unable\r\n   Incline _very_ gently until nearly inverted, when\r\n   Air if present will ascend in a bubble into the cistern.\r\n   Suspend barometer in good light out of sunshine.\r\n   Let no heat of fire or lamp affect it.\r\n   Let no sudden changes of temperature affect it.\r\n   It _must_ hang _absolutely_ vertically.\r\n   Note temperature of attached thermometer before reading barometer.\r\n   Then adjust mercury in cistern to touch ivory point.\r\n   Then adjust vernier and take reading _quickly_.\r\n   Ascertain height above sea-level according to direction.\r\n\r\nThe Storm Glass (Fig. 36) is a glass bottle, ten inches long,\r\ncontaining a mixture of camphor, nitre, sal-ammoniac, alcohol, and\r\nwater. As “temperature affects the mixture much,” an arrangement has\r\nrecently been designed in which the stem of a thermometer is immersed\r\nin the fluid, as shown at Fig. 37, thus imparting a higher value to its\r\nindications. The late Admiral Fitzroy says—\r\n\r\n“Since 1825, we have generally had some of these glasses, as\r\ncuriosities rather than otherwise; for nothing certain could be made of\r\ntheir variations until lately, when it was fairly demonstrated that if\r\nfixed undisturbed in free air, not exposed to radiation, fire, or sun,\r\nbut in the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room, or, _preferably_,\r\nin the outer air, the chemical mixture in a so-called storm glass\r\nvaries in character with the _direction_ of the wind—not its force.”\r\n\r\nThe quarter from which the wind or storm is blowing is indicated by the\r\nsubstance adhering more closely to the bottom of the glass _opposite_\r\nto the point whence the wind or tempest arises.\r\n\r\nThe Sympiesometer is an instrument used chiefly at sea for purposes of\r\ncomparison with the mercurial and aneroid barometers. Its indications\r\nresult partly from the pressure and partly from the temperature of the\r\natmosphere; it would, therefore, be more correctly named a\r\nThermo-Barometer.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 35.      36.      37.\r\n Storm Glass, or Chemical Weather Glass. Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nThe _height_ of the atmosphere has been variously estimated:—By\r\nBravais, from the duration of twilight, at 66 to nearly 100 miles; by\r\nDalton, in 1819, from observations of the auroral light, at 102 miles;\r\nby Sir John Herschel, from similar observations in 1861, at 83 miles;\r\nfrom observations of meteors, from 100 to 200 miles; by Liais, in 1859,\r\nfrom observations on the polarisation of the sky, at no less than 212\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe _density_ of the atmosphere diminishes with distance from the\r\nearth’s surface, in accordance with the following rule:—“At a height\r\nof seven miles the density of the atmosphere is reduced to one-fourth\r\nthe density at the sea-level, and for every additional seven miles, the\r\nrarity of the air is similarly quadrupled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             NOTE ON THE VERIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS AT THE\r\n                            KEW OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nThe Kew Committee of the Royal Society receive, for verification and\r\ncomparison with the standard instruments of the Kew Observatory,\r\nbarometers, thermometers, and other instruments intended for\r\nmeteorological observation or scientific investigations.\r\n\r\nAny persons ordering instruments of opticians may direct them to be\r\npreviously forwarded to the observatory for verification.\r\n\r\nA scale of charges is issued by the Committee which is exclusive of\r\npacking and carriage, or of rail expenses, when a special messenger is\r\nsent out.

This is, in\r\nfact, the substance of Dr. Wells’s famous Theory of Dew, enunciated in\r\n1814, and which, according to Dr. Tyndall, “has stood the test of all\r\nsubsequent criticism, and is now universally accepted,” and by which\r\nall the phenomena of dew may be explained.\r\n\r\nDr. Wells’s experiments were interesting and conclusive. He exposed\r\ndefinite weights (10 grains) of wool to the air on clear nights, one\r\n_on_ a four-legged stool, the other _under_ it, the upper portion\r\ngained 14 grains in weight, the lower only 4 grains. On an evening when\r\none portion of wool, protected by a curved pasteboard roof, gained only\r\n2 grains, a similar portion on the top of the miniature roof gained 16\r\ngrains. A little reflection will suggest the explanation: radiation\r\nfrom the wool was arrested by the pasteboard cover, while the portion\r\nfully exposed to the sky lost all its heat, and thus condensation\r\nensued. Dr. Wells speaks with such candour, and so pointedly, on this\r\nfact and its consequences, that his words may be advantageously quoted:\r\n“I had often, in the pride of half-knowledge, smiled at the means\r\nfrequently employed by gardeners to protect tender plants from cold, as\r\nit appeared to me impossible that a thin mat, or any such flimsy\r\nsubstance, could prevent them from attaining the temperature of the\r\natmosphere, by which alone I thought them liable to be injured. But\r\nwhen I had learned that bodies on the surface of the earth become\r\nduring a still and serene night colder than the atmosphere, by\r\nradiating their heat to the heavens, I perceived immediately a just\r\nreason for the practice I had before deemed useless.”\r\n\r\nFamiliar instances of the formation of dew will have been noted by many\r\n“watchers;” _e. g._, breathing on a cold pane of glass, a tumbler of\r\ncold water becoming dew-covered on being brought into a warm room, the\r\noutside of a tankard of iced claret cup, &c. When, radiation is so free\r\nand rapid that the temperature is below the freezing point, the dew\r\nfreezes as it forms, producing _hoar-frost_.\r\n\r\nIn our climate the air is never completely dry, nor completely\r\nsaturated with moisture, and the amount of aqueous vapour held in\r\nsuspension is very variable. This fact has important bearings on many\r\nbranches of industry, as also on the hygienic qualities of the\r\natmosphere. The consideration that a certain amount of moisture in the\r\nair is necessary to the continuance of health will suggest the\r\nimportance of maintaining that due proportion in the atmosphere of sick\r\nrooms, where the artificial heat so injudiciously used, often disturbs\r\nthe healthful hygrometric condition of the air. Mr. GLAISHER is of\r\nopinion that the medical profession should enforce, as far as lies in\r\ntheir power, the use of this simple and effective instrument, which\r\ngives indications so important to the comfort of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe _amount_ of moisture in the air is _estimated_ by the use of\r\ninstruments called Hygrometers, which may be thus classified:—\r\n\r\n1. Hygrometers of Absorption.—Made with hair, oatbeard, catgut,\r\nseaweed, grass, chloride of calcium.\r\n\r\n2. Hygrometers of Condensation.—Regnault’s, Daniell’s, Leslie’s,\r\nDyne’s.\r\n\r\n3. Hygrometers of Evaporation.—Mason’s Psychrometer, or Wet and Dry\r\nBulb Thermometers.\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious application of the affinity of the oatbeard for\r\nmoisture, Damp Detectors are constructed for tourists, commercial\r\ntravellers, &c., to test moisture and avoid the consequences of\r\nsleeping in damp beds. They are strongly gilt, and resemble in size and\r\nshape a lady’s watch.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 38.\r\n Damp Detector.\r\n Scale about 2/3.]\r\n\r\nIn Saussaure’s Hygrometer the frame is of brass, and the scale of the\r\nsame metal silvered. It has an attached thermometer, and the\r\nindications are the result of the contraction and expansion of a\r\nprepared human hair, consequent upon its absorbing or yielding\r\nmoisture. The scale is divided on the arc of a circle, and an index\r\nneedle, working on an enlarged arc, multiples the indications.\r\n\r\nRegnault’s Hygrometer (Fig. 39) consists of a thin and highly polished\r\nsilver tube or bottle, into the neck of which is inserted a delicate\r\nthermometer. The bottle has a lateral tubular opening, to which is\r\nattached a flexible tube with an ivory mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nEther is poured into the silver tube in sufficient quantity to cover\r\nthe bulb of the thermometer. The ether is then agitated by breathing\r\nthrough the flexible tube until, by the rapid evaporation thus\r\nproduced, a condensation of moisture takes place, readily observable on\r\nthe bright polished silver surface, and the temperature indicated by\r\nthe thermometer at that moment is the dew-point.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 39.\r\n Regnault’s Hygrometer. Scale\r\n about 1/10.]\r\n\r\nDaniell’s Hygrometer, or Dew-point Thermometer (Fig. 40), consists of a\r\nglass tube, bent twice at right angles, each extremity terminating in a\r\nbulb about 1-1/2 inch in diameter, supported on a brass stand, to which\r\na thermometer is attached to indicate the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding air. The lower bulb is of blackened glass, to facilitate\r\nthe observation of the dew-point; it is about three parts filled with\r\npure ether, and contains a very delicate thermometer. The upper bulb at\r\nthe extremity of the short stem is transparent, but covered with thin\r\nmuslin, upon which, when an observation is made, pure ether is slowly\r\ndropped. The evaporation rapidly lowers the temperature, until a moment\r\narrives at which dew condenses on the black bulb. A quick eye is\r\nnecessary to note _this_ and the temperature shown by the thermometer\r\n_simultaneously_, the latter showing the degree at which the atmosphere\r\nis saturated with moisture _at the time of observation_. To avoid\r\nerror, it is usual to note the temperature at which the dew disappears,\r\nand take the mean of the two temperatures.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 40.\r\n Daniell’s Hygrometer.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nDyne’s Hygrometer, for showing the dew-point by direct observation, by\r\nmeans of iced water and black glass, enables the observer to dispense\r\nwith the use of ether, and shows the dew-point with great distinctness.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 41.\r\n Mason’s Hygrometer.\r\n Scale about 1/6.]\r\n\r\nThe hygrometer in most general use is the wet and dry bulb thermometer,\r\nand for which Mr. Glaisher has calculated an elaborate set of tables, a\r\nbrief abstract of which sufficient for general purposes is subjoined.\r\n\r\n    For finding the Degree of Humidity of the Air from Observations of\r\n        a Dry Bulb and a Wet Bulb Thermometer, sometimes called Mason’s\r\n        Psychrometer.\r\n\r\n       +-------------+-----------------------------------------+\r\n       |             |DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRY BULB AND WET BULB |\r\n       |             |                READINGS.                |\r\n       |TEMPERATURE  +------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n       |  BY THE     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n       | DRY BULB    |  2°  |  4°  |  6°  |  8°  |  10° |  12° |\r\n       |THERMOMETER. |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n       |             +------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n       |             |           DEGREE OF HUMIDITY.           |\r\n       +-------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n       |     34°     |  79  |  63  |  50  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     36      |  82  |  66  |  53  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     38      |  83  |  68  |  56  |  45  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     40      |  84  |  70  |  58  |  47  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     42      |  84  |  71  |  59  |  49  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     44      |  85  |  72  |  60  |  50  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     46      |  86  |  73  |  61  |  51  | ...  | ...  |\r\n       |     48      |  86  |  73  |  62  |  52  |  44  | ...  |\r\n       |     50      |  86  |  74  |  63  |  53  |  45  | ...  |\r\n       |     52      |  86  |  74  |  64  |  54  |  46  | ...  |\r\n       |     54      |  86  |  74  |  64  |  55  |  47  | ...  |\r\n       |     56      |  87  |  75  |  65  |  56  |  48  | ...  |\r\n       |     58      |  87  |  76  |  66  |  57  |  49  | ...  |\r\n       |     60      |  88  |  76  |  66  |  58  |  50  |  43  |\r\n       |     62      |  88  |  77  |  67  |  58  |  50  |  44  |\r\n       |     64      |  88  |  77  |  67  |  59  |  51  |  45  |\r\n       |     66      |  88  |  78  |  68  |  60  |  52  |  45  |\r\n       |     68      |  88  |  78  |  68  |  60  |  52  |  46  |\r\n       |     70      |  88  |  78  |  69  |  61  |  53  |  47  |\r\n       |     72      |  89  |  79  |  69  |  61  |  54  |  48  |\r\n       |     74      |  89  |  79  |  70  |  62  |  55  |  48  |\r\n       |     76      |  89  |  79  |  71  |  63  |  55  |  49  |\r\n       |     78      |  89  |  79  |  71  |  63  |  56  |  50  |\r\n       |     80      |  90  |  80  |  71  |  63  |  56  |  50  |\r\n       |     82      |  90  |  80  |  72  |  64  |  57  |  51  |\r\n       |     84      |  90  |  80  |  72  |  64  |  57  |  51  |\r\n       |     86      |  90  |  80  |  72  |  64  |  58  |  52  |\r\n       +-------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of aqueous vapour which at any temperature can be\r\ndiffused in the air being represented by 100, the percentage of vapour\r\nactually present will be found in the table _opposite_ the temperature\r\nof the dry thermometer, and _under_ the difference between the dry bulb\r\nand wet bulb temperatures. The degree of humidity for intermediate\r\ntemperatures and differences to those given in the table can be easily\r\nestimated. Thus dry bulb 51°, wet bulb 46°, give 69 for the degree of\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\nThe instrument, as shown at page 48, consists of two thermometers\r\nattached to a support, which may be either slate or wood. The bulb of\r\none of the thermometers has some thin muslin tied over it, and is kept\r\nmoist by the capillary action of a thread dipping into a cistern of\r\nwater placed underneath. It will be obvious that the amount of\r\nevaporation will be in proportion to the dryness of the air, and that\r\nthe differences of temperature indicated by the two thermometers will\r\nbe greatest when the atmosphere is dry, and least when the air is damp.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 42.\r\n Board of Trade Thermometer\r\n Screen. Scale about 1/9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HYGROMETER PRECAUTIONS.\r\n\r\n Hygrometers should be exposed in the shade free from air-currents.\r\n The covering of the wet bulb must be very thin.\r\n The supply of water must be carefully regulated.\r\n The bulb must be constantly _moist_, yet not _too wet_.\r\n The supply of water must be ample in dry weather.\r\n In damp weather water must not drip from the wet bulb.\r\n Water reservoir should be as far as possible from the dry bulb.\r\n Dry bulb must never receive moisture from any source.\r\n Use distilled, rain, or softest water procurable, for wet bulb.\r\n When lime deposits from use of hard water change muslin and worsted.\r\n Replenish reservoir after, or long before, taking an observation.\r\n Well wash muslin and worsted before using.\r\n Also wash occasionally while in use.\r\n Change muslin twice a month or according to condition.\r\n Dust and blacks must not be allowed to accumulate on muslin.\r\n\r\n ⎧ When wet bulb is frozen, wet with ice-cold water by brush.\r\n ⎪ The water will first freeze, then cool to air-temperature.\r\n ⎨ After which wet bulb falls a trifle lower than dry one.\r\n ⎩ Then temperature of evaporation may be noted.\r\n\r\n ⎧ In thick fog wet bulb reads _above_ dry bulb.\r\n ⎪ In cold calm weather, wet bulb reads _above_ dry bulb.\r\n ⎨ This is owing to the air being perfectly saturated.\r\n ⎪ Covered bulb cannot therefore show temperature as well as uncovered.\r\n ⎩ In such cases both readings are assumed to be identical.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the instrument should be protected not only from\r\nthe sun’s direct rays, from rain and snow, but also from wind, the\r\ncurrents of which would, by increasing evaporation, cause the wet bulb\r\nthermometer to indicate a temperature not strictly due to the\r\nhygrometric condition of the atmosphere. For this purpose Thermometer\r\nScreens are employed. Illustrations of two forms are shown at Figs. 42\r\nand 43; they should be placed facing the north at a distance of four\r\nfeet from the ground. Fig. 42 shows the form adopted by the Board of\r\nTrade, for marine service, while Fig. 43 shows Mr. Stevenson’s\r\ndouble-louvred screen with perforated bottom, which ensures free\r\ningress and egress of air, the exclusion of snow and rain, and the\r\ndirect rays of the sun. Professor Wild recommends overlapping segments\r\nof sheet zinc for the construction of these screens, as possessing the\r\nadvantage over wood of becoming sooner in _thermic equilibrium_ with\r\nthe surrounding air, and thus preventing radiation. Stevenson’s Screen\r\nshould be erected on legs four feet high, and should stand over grass\r\non open ground. It should not be under the shadow of trees, nor within\r\ntwenty feet of any wall.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 43.\r\n Stevenson’s Thermometer Screen.\r\n Scale about 1/10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nThe important office performed by clouds in the economy of nature\r\nentitles them to extended consideration. A cloud may be defined as\r\n“water-dust,” since aqueous vapour diffused through the air is\r\ninvisible until the temperature is sufficiently lowered to produce\r\ncondensation; no satisfactory explanation, however, has yet been given\r\nof the mode of suspension of this water-dust, nor why it remains\r\nsuspended in opposition to gravitation. It is tolerably certain that\r\nelectricity is not without its influence, though the apparently\r\n_stationary_ character of some clouds is deceptive, for while there may\r\nbe no apparent motion in the mass the particles constituting the mass\r\nare undergoing continuous renewal, which justifies the assertion of\r\nEspy that every cloud is either a forming or dissolving cloud.\r\nAeronauts in ascending from the earth pass through many successive\r\nalternations of cloud-strata and clear air which owe their existence to\r\nthe varying temperature and degrees of humidity of the atmospheric\r\ncurrents so superposed.\r\n\r\nLuke Howard in his Askesian Lectures, 1802, divides clouds into three\r\nprimary modifications: cumulus, stratus, and cirrus, with intermediate\r\nforms resulting from combinations of the primaries, viz.,\r\ncirro-cumulus, cirro-stratus, cumulo-stratus, and cumulo-cirro-stratus\r\nor nimbus. This nomenclature is now universally adopted.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 44.\r\n Cirrus.]\r\n\r\nCIRRUS, or mare’s tail cloud, appears as parallel, flexuous, or\r\ndiverging streaks or fibres, partly straight. It is the lightest and\r\nthe highest of all clouds, being seldom less than three miles, and\r\noften ten miles, above the earth, and shows the greatest variety of\r\nform. On account of its great height it is assumed to consist of minute\r\nsnowflakes or crystals of ice, the refractions and reflections from\r\nwhich produce the halos, coronæ, and mock suns and moons which occur\r\nchiefly in this cloud and its derivatives. It retains its varied\r\noutlines longer than any other cloud; at sunrise it is the first to\r\nwelcome the sun’s rays, and at sunset the last to part with them. It is\r\nthe most useful of all clouds for weather warnings.\r\n\r\n    1. _Serene, settled weather may be expected_ when groups and\r\n        threads of cirri are seen during a gentle wind after severe\r\n        weather.\r\n\r\n    2. _A change to wet may be expected_ when, after continued fair\r\n        weather, filaments, or bands of cirri (_apparently_\r\n        stationary), with converging ends, travel across the sky.\r\n\r\n    3. _Rain or snow, and windy, variable weather may be expected_ when\r\n        cirri with fine tails vary much in a few hours.\r\n\r\n    4. _Continued wet weather may be undoubtedly expected_ when\r\n        horizontal sheets of cirri fall quickly and pass into the\r\n        cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\n    5. _A storm of wind and rain may be expected within forty-eight\r\n        hours_ when fine threads of cirri seem brushed backward from\r\n        the south-west.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 45.\r\n Cumulus.]\r\n\r\nCUMULUS.—This modification of cloud is most frequently seen on bright\r\nsummer days, and is appropriately called “the day cloud” and “the\r\nsummer cloud.” It is formed only in the daytime, in summer calms, and\r\nresults from the rise of vapours from rivers, lakes, and marshes into\r\nthe colder regions of the air, the lower portions of which are readily\r\nsaturable. They are characterized by a horizontal base, from which they\r\nrise in dense conical and hemispherical masses rivalling mountains in\r\ntheir magnitude.\r\n\r\nTheir formation is due to the convection of heat from the earth’s\r\nsurface, which renders the lower atmospheric strata capable of holding\r\na larger amount of aqueous vapour and simultaneously establishes an\r\nupward current, which reaching the colder regions of the air brings\r\nabout the condensation of the aqueous vapour into the elegant and\r\never-beautiful forms admired alike “by saint, by savage, and by sage.”\r\nThese begin as mere specks, which enlarge until the sky is nearly\r\ncovered in the afternoon, and towards sunset they generally disappear,\r\ntheir tops becoming cirri when the air is dry.\r\n\r\n    1. _Fine, calm, warm weather may be expected_ when cumuli are of\r\n        moderate size and of pleasing form and colour.\r\n\r\n    2. _Cold, tempestuous, rainy weather may be expected_ when cumuli\r\n        cover the sky, rolling over each other in dense, dark, and\r\n        abrupt masses.\r\n\r\n    3. _Thunder may be expected_ when cumuli of hemispherical form are\r\n        characterized by an extreme silvery whiteness.\r\n\r\n    4. _Rain may be expected_ when cumuli increase in number towards\r\n        evening, sinking at the same time into the lower portions of\r\n        the air.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 46.\r\n Stratus.]\r\n\r\nSTRATUS.—As its name implies, this is a horizontal sheet of cloud\r\nformed near the earth at night (whence it has been called “the night\r\ncloud”) by the condensation of moist air from rivers, lakes, and\r\nmarshes, or damp ground which has lost its day-heat by radiation,\r\nespecially in calm clear evenings, after warm days. It appears as a\r\nwhite mist near, and sometimes touching, the earth. It attains its\r\nmaximum density about midnight, but is dissipated by the rays of the\r\nmorning sun. Its formation, watched from a height over a large city, is\r\nhighly interesting, and is attributed by Sir John Herschel to the soot\r\nsuspended over such localities, each particle of which acts as “an\r\ninsulated radiant, collects dew on itself, and sinks down rapidly as a\r\nheavy body.” Still more interesting is it to observe from a similar\r\nelevation the dissipation of this cloud when the sun has attained such\r\nan altitude that its rays fall on the upper surface of the stratus\r\ncloud, which then heaves like the billows of the ocean, while the whole\r\nmass seems to rise spontaneously from the earth, and speedily vanishes\r\n“into air, into thin air.”\r\n\r\n    1. _The finest and most serene weather may be expected_ when\r\n        stratus clouds present the appearances just described.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-CUMULUS, or “mackerel sky,” is a well-known form of cloud\r\noccurring in small roundish masses, looking like flocks of sheep at\r\nrest, and often at great heights. It is seldom seen in winter.\r\n\r\n    1. _Increased heat may be expected_ when cirro-cumuli appear.\r\n\r\n    2. _A storm or thunder may be expected_ when cirro-cumuli occur\r\n        mingled with cumulo-stratus in very dense, round, and close\r\n        masses.\r\n\r\n    3. _Warm wet weather, and a thaw, may be expected_ when\r\n        cirro-cumuli occur in winter.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-STRATUS “appears to result from the subsidence of the fibres of\r\ncirrus to a horizontal position, at the same time approaching\r\nlaterally. The form and relative position when seen in the distance\r\nfrequently give the idea of shoals of fish.” It is called “the vane\r\ncloud” and “mackerel-backed sky.”\r\n\r\n    1. _Rain, snow, and storm may be expected_ when _cirro-stratus_ is\r\n        seen alone or mingled with cirro-cumulus, especially if the\r\n        cirro-cumulus passes away.\r\n\r\n    2. _Fair weather may be expected_ when from a mixture of\r\n        cirro-stratus and cirro-cumulus the former disappears, leaving\r\n        the latter in possession of the sky.\r\n\r\n    3. _Thunder and heat_ are generally attended by waved cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCUMULO-STRATUS.—This form of cloud results from the mingling of the\r\ncumulus and cirro-stratus; it appears sometimes as a thick bank of\r\ncloud with overhanging masses. The cloud known as “_distinct_”\r\ncumulo-stratus appears as a cumulus surrounded by small fleecy clouds.\r\n\r\n    1. _Thunder may be expected_ when “distinct” cumulo-stratus appear.\r\n\r\n    2. _Sudden atmospheric changes may be expected_ when cumulo-stratus\r\n        appear.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 47.\r\n Nimbus.]\r\n\r\nNIMBUS, OR CUMULO-CIRRO-STRATUS.—The name of this cloud at once\r\nsuggests that it is produced by a combination of the three primary\r\nforms of cloud. The _nimbus_ is popularly known as “the rain cloud.” It\r\nis really a system of clouds, having its origin chiefly in the tendency\r\nof the _cumulo-stratus_ to spread, overcast the sky, and settle down to\r\na dense horizontal black or grey sheet, above which spreads the\r\n_cirrus_, and from below which rain begins to fall.\r\n\r\n    1. _A cessation of rain may be expected_ when the grey lower\r\n        portion of _nimbus_ begins to break up.\r\n\r\n    2. _A thunderstorm may be expected_ when the _nimbus_ character of\r\n        the cloud is very perfect.\r\n\r\n    3. _Very copious showers may be expected_ when the _cirri_\r\n        projected from the top of the rain-cloud are very numerous.\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF CLOUDS.—Any record of the proportion of sky covered by cloud\r\nshould be made on a scale of 0 to 10. A clear sky is registered 0, and\r\na sky wholly obscured as 10, any intermediate condition being\r\nrepresented by 5—7, or other figures deemed appropriate by the\r\nobserver. The _kind_ of cloud should be noted, as also the direction in\r\nwhich it is driven by the wind, whether in the upper or lower strata of\r\nthe air. This operation may be assisted by an ingenious arrangement,\r\nexhibited by Mr. Goddard in 1862, and called a “cloud reflector,”\r\nobtainable at any optician’s. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory\r\nestablish the facts that the least amount of cloud exists during the\r\nnight, especially in May and June, and the greatest amount at midday,\r\nand in winter; also that from November to February three-fourths of the\r\nheavens are obscured by sun-repelling clouds.\r\n\r\nHEIGHT OF CLOUDS.—Great diversity of opinion exists on this point. It\r\nis asserted, on the one hand, that the region of clouds does not extend\r\nbeyond five miles above sea-level, but Glaisher has attained a height\r\nof 36,960 feet, and from thence saw clouds floating at a great height\r\nabove him; and it is considered probable that cirri are often ten miles\r\nabove the earth.\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF CLOUDS.—This is of two kinds: 1st. Velocity of\r\nPropagation; and 2nd. Velocity of Motion. The first occurs when at a\r\ngiven altitude the dew-point is suddenly attained, when the sky on one\r\noccasion was covered from the eastern to the western horizon at the\r\nrate of 300 miles per hour. The second is dependent on the force of\r\natmospheric currents, which is much greater in the upper regions of the\r\nair than in those nearer the earth. Accurate observations of the\r\nshadows of clouds, borne across the fields on a summer’s day, warrant\r\nthe assertion that an apparently slow motion of clouds is equal to\r\neighty miles an hour, while a velocity of 120 miles is attained without\r\nimpressing the observer with the idea of rapidity.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of clouds Admiral Fitzroy says:—\r\n\r\n                   May be Expected\r\n\r\n                   -----\r\n\r\n  Fine weather     When clouds are “soft-looking or delicate.”\r\n\r\n  Wind             When clouds are hard-edged or oily-looking.\r\n\r\n  Less wind        In proportion as the clouds look _softer_.\r\n\r\n  More wind        The harder, more “greasy,” rolled, tufted, or\r\n                   ragged the clouds look.\r\n\r\n  Rain             When small-inky-looking clouds appear.\r\n\r\n  Wind _and_ rain  When light scud clouds are seen driving across\r\n                   heavy masses.\r\n\r\n  Wind only        When light scud clouds are seen alone.\r\n\r\n  Change of wind   When high upper clouds cross the sun, moon, or\r\n                   stars in a direction different from that of the\r\n                   lower clouds, or the wind then felt below.\r\n\r\n  Wind             With tawny or copper-coloured clouds.\r\n\r\nThe following “Weather Warnings” may be gathered from the COLOUR OF THE\r\nSKY:—\r\n\r\nWhether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages fine weather; a\r\nsickly greenish hue, wind and rain; a red sky in the morning, bad\r\nweather, or much wind or rain; a grey sky in the morning, fine weather;\r\na high dawn (_i. e._, when the first indications of daylight are seen\r\nabove a bank of clouds), wind; a low dawn (_i. e._, when the day breaks\r\non or near the horizon), fair weather. Light, delicate, quiet tints or\r\ncolours, with soft, indefinite forms of clouds, indicate and accompany\r\nfine weather; but gaudy or unusual hues, with hard, definitely outlined\r\nclouds, foretell rain and probably strong wind. Also a bright yellow\r\nsky at sunset presages wind; a pale yellow, wet; orange or\r\ncopper-coloured, wind and rain: and thus, by the prevalence of red,\r\nyellow, green, grey, or other tints, the coming weather may be told\r\nvery nearly; indeed, if aided by instruments, almost exactly.\r\n\r\nAfter fine, clear weather the first signs in a sky of a coming change\r\nare usually light streaks, curls, wisps, or mottled patches of white\r\ndistant cloud, which increase and are followed by an overcasting of\r\nmurky vapour that grows into cloudiness. This appearance, more or less\r\noily or watery as wind or rain will prevail, is an infallible sign.\r\n\r\nUsually, the higher and more distant such clouds seem to be, the more\r\ngradual, but general, the coming change of weather will prove.\r\n\r\nMisty clouds, forming or hanging on heights, show wind and rain coming,\r\nif they remain, increase, or descend; if they rise or disperse, the\r\nweather will improve or become fine.\r\n\r\n                   May be Expected\r\n\r\n                   -----\r\n\r\n  Fine weather     When the sky is grey in the morning.\r\n\r\n  Wind             With a high dawn.\r\n\r\n  Fair weather     With a low dawn.\r\n\r\n  Wind             When the sky at sunset is of a _bright_ yellow.\r\n\r\n  Rain             When the sky at sunset is of a _pale_ yellow.\r\n\r\n  Wind and rain    When the sky is orange or copper colour.\r\n\r\n  Fine weather     When the sky has light, delicate, quiet tints and\r\n                   soft, indefinite forms of clouds.\r\n\r\n  Rain and wind    When the sky has gaudy, unusual hues, with hard,\r\n                   definite outlined clouds.\r\n\r\n  Fair weather     When sea-birds fly out early and far to seaward.\r\n\r\n  Stormy weather   When sea-birds hang about the land, or fly inland.\r\n\r\n  Fair weather     When dew is deposited. Its formation never\r\n                   _begins_ under an overcast sky, or when there is\r\n                   much wind.\r\n\r\n  Rain             On what is called a good _hearing_ day.\r\n\r\n  Rain             When remarkable clearness of atmosphere,\r\n                   especially near the horizon, exists, distant\r\n                   objects, objects, such as hills, being unusually\r\n                   visible or well defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RAIN.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere at a given temperature is capable of retaining only a\r\ngiven quantity of aqueous vapour, invisibly diffused through it, at\r\nwhich temperature it is said to be _saturated_. Should the temperature\r\nfrom any cause be lowered, the aqueous vapour at once becomes visible\r\nin the form of either cloud, dew, rain, snow, or hail. It has already\r\nbeen shown that, although marshes and rivers, inland seas and lakes,\r\nyield by evaporation watery vapours to the air, the ocean is the great\r\nsource of rain, whence it is lifted in vast quantities by the sun’s\r\nradiant heat, to be subsequently condensed by passing into cooler\r\nregions, or by contact with cold mountain peaks, falling to earth as a\r\nfertilizing shower or a devastating flood.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel accounts for the formation of raindrops by\r\nsaying:—“In whatever part of a cloud the original ascensional movement\r\nof the vapour ceases, the elementary globules of which it consists\r\nbeing abandoned to the action of gravity, begin to fall. The larger\r\nglobules fall fastest, and if (as must happen) they overtake the slower\r\nones, they incorporate, and the diameter being thereby increased, the\r\ndescent grows more rapid, and the encounters more frequent, till at\r\nlength the globule emerges from the lower surface of the cloud at the\r\n‘vapour plane’ as a drop of rain, the size of the drops depending on\r\nthe thickness of the cloud stratum and its density.”\r\n\r\nRain is very unequally distributed, there being portions of the torrid\r\nzone where it _never_ falls, one locality in Norway where it falls\r\nthree days out of four, and another on the western side of Patagonia,\r\nat the base of the Andes, where it falls every day. The quantities\r\nrecorded as having fallen at one time in some localities are simply\r\nappalling. A fall of one inch is considered a very heavy rain in Great\r\nBritain, and this fact will enable the reader partially to realize the\r\nfollowing stupendous recorded falls:—Loch Awe, Scotland, 7 inches in\r\n30 hours; Joyeuse, France, 31 inches in 22 hours; Gibraltar, 33 inches\r\nin 26 hours; hills above Bombay, 24 inches in one night; and on the\r\nKhasia Hills, where the annual rainfall is 600 inches, 30 inches have\r\nbeen known to fall on each of five successive days. Mr. G. J. Symons,\r\nthe able editor of the “Meteorological Magazine,” and indefatigable\r\nsuperintendent of 2,000 Rain Gauges throughout the United Kingdom, has\r\ncompiled a table, showing the equivalents of rain in inches, its weight\r\nper acre, and bulk in gallons, the following portion of which, while\r\nvery useful to the farmer, will enable the curious reader to make some\r\ninteresting calculations, based on the figures quoted above:—\r\n\r\n         TABLE SHOWING EQUIVALENT OF INCHES OF RAIN IN GALLONS,\r\n                          AND WEIGHT PER ACRE.\r\n\r\n           Inches of Rain   Tons per Acre   Gallons per Acre\r\n                 0·1             10              2262\r\n                 0·2             20              4525\r\n                 0·3             30              6787\r\n                 0·4             40              9049\r\n                 0·5             50             11312\r\n                 0·6             61             13574\r\n                 0·7             71             15836\r\n                 0·8             81             18098\r\n                 0·9             91             20361\r\n                1·in.           101             22623\r\n\r\nThe instruments called Rain Gauges or Pluviometers are, as their name\r\nimplies, constructed to measure the amount of rain falling in any given\r\nlocality, and those in most general use have this principle in common:\r\nthat the graduated glass always bears a definite relation to the area\r\nof the receiving surface. A very extraordinary and hitherto unexplained\r\nfact in connection with the fall of rain, and which justifies the\r\nopinion that its formation is not limited to the region of visible\r\ncloud, is that a series of rain gauges placed at different elevations\r\nabove the soil are found to collect very different quantities of rain,\r\nthe amount being _greater_ at the _lower_ level. Thus, twelve months’\r\nobservations by Dr. Heberden determined that the amount of rain on the\r\ntop of Westminster Abbey was only twelve inches, that on a house close\r\nby but much lower eighteen inches, and on the ground during the same\r\ninterval of time twenty-two inches. Accordingly, ten inches is the\r\nheight at which meteorologists have agreed the edge of the rain gauge\r\nshould be placed from the ground. The spot chosen should be perfectly\r\nlevel, and at least as far distant from any building or tree as the\r\nbuilding or tree is high, and, if the gauge cannot be equally exposed\r\nto all points, a south-west aspect is preferable. It is also important\r\nthat the rain gauge should be well supported, in order to avoid its\r\nbeing blown over by the wind; and, should frost follow a fall of rain,\r\nthe instrument should be conveyed to a warm room to thaw before\r\nmeasuring the collected contents. The graduated glass furnished with\r\neach instrument should stand quite level when measuring the rain, and\r\nthe reading be taken midway between the two apparent surfaces of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe best form of rain gauge is that in use in the Meteorological Office.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 48.\r\n Howard’s Rain Gauge.\r\n Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nHoward’s Rain Gauge consists of a vertical glass receiver, or bottle,\r\nthrough the neck of which the long terminal tube of a circular funnel,\r\nfive inches in diameter, is inserted. A metal collar or tube fits over\r\nthe outside of the neck of the receiver, and aids in keeping the funnel\r\nlevel, while the tube extends to within half an inch of the bottom,\r\nthus ensuring the retention of every drop of rain which falls within\r\nthe area of the funnel. The glass vessel furnished with the instrument\r\nis graduated to 100ths of an inch. A modification of this instrument is\r\nmade with a glass tube at the side graduated to inches, 10ths, and\r\n100ths, showing the amount of rainfall by direct observation, thus\r\ndispensing with the use of a supplementary graduated measure.\r\n\r\nIn Glashier’s Rain Gauge special provision is made, in two ways, to\r\nprevent possible loss by evaporation, even in the warmest months of the\r\nyear. 1. The receiving vessel is partly sunk beneath the soil, thus\r\nkeeping the contents cool. 2. The receiving surface of the funnel,\r\naccurately turned to a diameter of eight inches, terminates at its\r\nlower extremity in a curved tube, which, by always retaining the last\r\nfew drops of rain, prevents evaporation. The graduated vessel, in this\r\ninstance also, is divided to 100ths of an inch, having due regard to\r\nthe larger area, 8 in. of the funnel. For use in tropical climates,\r\nwhere, as has been shown, the rainfall is excessive, a modification of\r\nthis instrument is supplied by the instrument makers, having an extra\r\nlarge receiver and tap for drawing off the collected rain.\r\n\r\nLuke Howard, in his “Climate of London,” says: “It must be a subject of\r\ngreat satisfaction and confidence to the husbandman to know at the\r\nbeginning of a summer, by the certain evidence of meteorological\r\nresults on record, that the season, in the ordinary course of things,\r\nmay be expected to be a dry and warm one, or to find, in a certain\r\nperiod of it, that the average quantity of rain to be expected for the\r\nmonth has fallen. On the other hand, when there is reason, from the\r\nsame source of information, to expect much rain, the man who has\r\ncourage to begin his operations under an unfavourable sky, but with\r\ngood ground to conclude, from the state of his instruments and his\r\ncollateral knowledge, that a fair interval is approaching, may often be\r\nprofiting by his observations, while his cautious neighbour, who\r\n‘waited for the weather to settle,’ may find that he has let the\r\nopportunity go by.” This superiority, however, is attainable by a very\r\nmoderate share of application to the subject, and by the keeping of a\r\nplain diary of the barometer and rain gauge, with the hygrometer and\r\nvane under his daily notice.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 49.\r\n Symons’s Rain Gauge.\r\n Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nSymons’s Rain Gauge resembles Howard’s, but has the advantage of having\r\nthe glass receiver enclosed in a black or white japanned metal or\r\ncopper jacket with openings permitting an approximate observation of\r\nthe collected rain. The metal jacket is also furnished with strong iron\r\nspikes, which are firmly pressed into the soil, as shown at Fig. 49,\r\nthus ensuring perfect steadiness by its power to resist the wind. The\r\ngraduated measure contains half an inch of rain (for a 5 inch circle)\r\ndivided into 100ths.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 50.\r\n Symons’s Storm Rain Gauge.\r\n Scale about 1/12.]\r\n\r\nMr. Symons has devised another rain gauge of so ingenious and\r\ninteresting a character that it needs only to become generally known\r\namong amateur meteorologists to be in universal demand. By its means an\r\nobserver at a distant window may read off the rain as it falls. It is\r\nshown at Fig. 50, where the usual 5-inch funnel surmounts a long glass\r\ntube attached to a black board bearing a very open scale marking tenths\r\nof an inch in _white_ lines; a white float inside the tube constitutes\r\nthe index, which rises as the rain increases in quantity. If, as\r\nsometimes happens during a thunderstorm, the rainfall is excessive, a\r\nsecond tube on the left permits the measurement of a second inch of\r\nrain. It will be obvious that if the _time_ at which the rain begins to\r\nfall be noted the _rate_ at which it falls, as well as the quantity, is\r\nindicated at sight by this instrument.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 51.\r\n Beckley’s Pluviograph. Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nCrossley’s Registering Rain Gauge has a receiving surface of 100 square\r\ninches. The rain falling within this area passes through a tube to a\r\nvibrating bucket, which sets in motion a train of wheels, and these\r\nmove the indices on three dials, recording the amount of rain in\r\ninches, 10ths, and 100ths. Printed directions are furnished with each\r\ninstrument, and the simplicity of the mechanism ensures due accuracy. A\r\ntest measure, holding exactly five cubic inches of water, sent with\r\neach gauge, affords the means of checking its readings from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBeckley’s Pluviograph possesses the exceptional merit of recording with\r\nequal precision all rainfalls, from a slight summer shower to a heavy\r\nstorm of rain. It may be placed in a hole in the ground, with the\r\nreceiving surface raised the standard height of ten inches above its\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nFig. 51 illustrates the construction of the instrument.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 52.      53.\r\n Stutter’s Self-recording Rain Gauge. Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nThe funnel has a receiving surface of 100 square inches, protected by a\r\nlip 1-1/4 inch deep, to retain the splashes. The rain flows into a\r\ncopper receiving vessel on the right, which, floating in a cistern of\r\nmercury, sinks and draws down with it a pencil, which records the event\r\non a white porcelain cylinder moved by a clock. When the receiving\r\nvessel is full the syphon comes into action, rapidly drawing off _the\r\nwhole_ of the water, the vessel rising almost at a bound, the action\r\nbeing recorded by a vertical line on the porcelain cylinder. Two or\r\nmore cylinders are supplied with each instrument; and, as the pencil\r\nmarks are readily removed by a little soap and water, a clean one may\r\nbe always kept at hand for exchange once in every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E. Stutter’s Self-recording Rain Gauge is ingenious, and for a\r\nself-recording instrument is very moderate in price, while it\r\nefficiently shows the rainfall for every hour in the twenty-four (Figs.\r\n52, 53).\r\n\r\nAn eight-day clock with its upright spindle revolves a small funnel\r\nwith a sloping tube, the end of which passes successively over the\r\nmouth of the twelve or twenty-four compartments in the rim of the\r\ninstrument; beneath each compartment is placed a tube, as shown in the\r\nsectional figure. All rain received by the outer funnel drips into the\r\nsmaller revolving funnel, and flows down the sloping tube, the end of\r\nwhich is timed to take an hour in passing over each compartment, so\r\nthat the rain, for example, which falls between twelve and one o’clock\r\nwill be found in the tube marked 1. Each tube can contain half an inch\r\nof rain, and any overflow falls into a vessel beneath, and can be\r\nmeasured; the tube which has overflown shows the hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               V.—MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWind is air in motion. The motion of the air is caused by inequality of\r\ntemperature. The earth becomes warmed by the sun, and radiates the heat\r\nthus acquired back upon the air, which, expanding and becoming lighter,\r\nascends to higher regions, while colder and denser currents rush in to\r\noccupy the vacated space. Two points are to be noted in connection with\r\nthis rush of air which we call wind, viz., its _direction_ and\r\n_velocity_ or _force_. Both are estimated scientifically by instruments\r\ncalled Anemometers,[13] while mariners and the dwellers on our coasts\r\nhave a nomenclature of their own by which to indicate variation in the\r\n_force_ of the wind, founded on the amount of sail a vessel can carry\r\nwith safety at the time. In the matter of _direction_ winds are classed\r\nas constant, periodical, and variable.\r\n\r\n [Footnote 13: _Anemos_, the wind; _metron_, measure.]\r\n\r\nCONSTANT WINDS.—_The Trade Winds._—The violent contrast between the\r\ntemperature of the equator and the poles is well known, and from the\r\nvast area included within the tropics ascending currents of rarefied\r\nair are incessantly rising and being as incessantly replaced by a rush\r\nof cold air from the poles to the equator. Were the earth stationary,\r\nthis interchange would be of the simplest kind; on arriving within the\r\ninfluence of the ascending equatorial current the air from the poles\r\nwould be carried to the higher regions and turning over would proceed\r\nto the poles, and, becoming cold and dense in traversing the higher\r\nstratum, would descend and resume its course _ad infinitum_. The\r\nrevolution of the earth on its axis changes all this: the first effect\r\nis that the air at the equator is borne along with the earth at the\r\nrate of seventeen miles a minute from west to east, a rate which\r\ndiminishes at 60° of latitude to one-half that velocity, until at the\r\npoles it is nothing; consequently a _slow_ north wind flowing to the\r\nequator is continually passing over places possessing a higher velocity\r\nthan itself, and not immediately acquiring that velocity, there is\r\naccording to the law of the composition of forces a compromise effected\r\nresulting in a north-east wind. In a similar manner the same process in\r\nthe southern hemisphere results in a south-east wind. These winds have\r\nacquired the name of _Trade Winds_ on account of the facilities\r\nafforded to navigation by their constancy. The _North Trades_ occur in\r\nthe Atlantic between 9° and 30° and in the Pacific between 9° and 26°.\r\nThe _South Trades_ occur in the Atlantic between lat. 4° N. and 22° S.\r\nand in the Pacific between latitude 4° N. and 23-1/2° S. These limits\r\nextend northward with the sun from January to June, and southward from\r\nJuly to December.\r\n\r\nParallel to the equator and extending between 2° and 3° on each side is\r\na broad belt, where the north and south trades neutralize each other,\r\nproducing what is called the “_Region or Belt of Calms_.” Though wind\r\nis absent, thunderstorms and heavy rains are of daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhen Humboldt ascended Teneriffe the trade wind was blowing at its base\r\nin the usual direction, but on arriving at the summit he found a strong\r\nwind blowing in the opposite direction. Observation has shown that this\r\nupper current prevails north and south of the equator, and that, after\r\npassing the limit of the trade winds, it descends to form the\r\nsouth-_west_ winds of the north temperate zone and the north-_west_\r\nwinds of the south temperate zone; the _westing_ being due to the same\r\ncause as the _easting_ in the regular trades, viz., the rotation of the\r\nearth on its axis. These winds are called the Return Trades, but are\r\nnot equal in constancy to the regular trade winds.\r\n\r\nPERIODICAL WINDS.—_Land and Sea Breezes_ occur on the coasts, chiefly\r\nin tropical countries, but sometimes in Great Britain during the summer\r\nmonths when the land during the day becomes very hot, causing an\r\nascending column of air, which is replaced by a comparatively colder\r\nstream flowing inwards from the sea. At sunset the conditions are\r\nreversed, the earth becomes rapidly cooled by radiation, the sea\r\ncontinuing comparatively warm, the air over it ascends, and its place\r\nis supplied by a cold breeze, which “blows off the shore,” as\r\nillustrated by the diagrams and the following experiment—In the centre\r\nof a large tub of water float a water plate containing hot water,\r\nimagine the former to be the ocean and the latter the heated land,\r\nrarefying the air over it. Light a candle and blow it out and hold it\r\nwhile still smoking over the cold water, when the smoke will be seen to\r\nmove towards the plate. The reverse of this takes place if the tub be\r\nfilled with hot water and the water plate with cold. When this\r\nphenomenon takes place on a large scale, as in the case of the north\r\ntrade winds being drawn from their course by the heated shores of\r\nSouthern Asia, the gigantic sea breeze thus produced is called the\r\nsouth-west monsoon. This occurs from April to October, when the sun is\r\nnorth of the equator. When the sun is south of the equator—that is,\r\nfrom October to April—the analogue of the land breeze is produced, and\r\nis called the north-east monsoon.\r\n\r\nVARIABLE WINDS.—The character of this class of winds is determined by\r\nthe physical configuration of the country in which they occur. Some\r\ntracts are marked by luxuriant vegetation, others are bare. Here\r\nmountains lift their awful fronts and “midway leave the storm,” there\r\nan arid plain extends itself to the seashore, or inland, towards a\r\nchain of lakes. Within the tropics these purely local conditions are\r\ninsufficient to overcome the force of the prevalent atmospheric\r\ncurrents: such, however, is not the case beyond the tropical zone.\r\nThere the variable winds prevail, for which space permits only the\r\nmention of their names:—The _Simoom_ (from the Arabic _samma_, hot),\r\npeculiar to the hot sandy deserts of Africa and Western Asia. The\r\n_Sirocco_ blows over the two Sicilies as a hot wind from the south. It\r\nextends sometimes to the shores of the Black and Caspian seas,\r\nspreading death among animals and plants. The _Solano_ prevails at\r\ncertain seasons in the south of Spain: its direction is south-east. The\r\n_Harmattan_ is another wind of the same class, peculiar to Senegambia\r\nand Guinea. The _Puna Winds_ blow for four months over a barren\r\ntableland called the Puna, in Peru. They are a portion of the\r\nsouth-east trade winds, which, having crossed the Pampas, are thereby\r\ndeprived of moisture, and become the most parching wind in the world.\r\nThe _East Winds_, peculiar to the spring in Britain, blowing as they do\r\nthrough Russia, over Europe, are a portion of the great polar current,\r\ndistinctive of that season of the year. They are dry and parching,\r\nevery one being familiar with the unpleasant bodily sensations\r\nattendant on this much-abused and yet most beneficent wind.\r\n\r\nThe _Etesian Winds_ are drawn from the north across the Mediterranean\r\nby the great heat of the African desert. The _Mistral_ is a strong\r\nnorth-west wind peculiar to the south-east of France. The _Pampero_ is\r\na north-west wind, blowing in summer from the Pampas of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the year 1600 Lord Bacon remarked that the\r\npreponderating tendency of the wind was decidedly to veer _with_ the\r\nsun’s motion, thus passing from N. through N.E., E., S.E., to south,\r\nthence through S.W., W.N.W., to N.; also, that it often makes a\r\ncomplete circuit in that direction, or more than one in succession\r\n(occupying sometimes many days in so doing), but that it rarely backs,\r\nand very rarely or never makes a complete circuit in the contrary\r\ndirection. The merit of having first demonstrated that this tendency is\r\na direct consequence of the earth’s rotation is due to Professor Dove,\r\nof Berlin, who has also shown that the three systems of atmospheric\r\ncurrents just treated of, viz., the constant, periodical, and variable\r\nwinds, are all amenable to the same influence.\r\n\r\nAs to the _mode_ of observing the wind, Admiral Fitzroy recommends that\r\na true east and west line should be marked _about the time of the\r\nequinox_, and the north, south, and other points of the compass being\r\nadded, to take the bearings of the wind in relation to a dial so\r\nprepared, the indications of the _lower_ stratum of clouds in\r\nconjunction with vanes and smoke being preferred to any other.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the wind should always be given according to _true_,\r\nand not to _compass bearings_. Two points to the westward nearly\r\nrepresents the amount of “Variation of the Compass” for the British\r\nIsles, which yields the following table for the conversion of\r\ndirections observed by the compass in Great Britain and Ireland to\r\napproximate true bearings.\r\n\r\n   +---------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n   |Compass bearings.

While the\r\nwind is shifting from south-west, by west, north-west, and _north to\r\nnorth-east_, the thermometer is falling, but while shifting from\r\nnorth-east, by east, south-east and south, towards _south and\r\nsouth-west_, the thermometer is rising. Now the barometric column does\r\njust the reverse. From north-east the barometer falls as the wind\r\nshifts through the east to south-east, south, and south-west, and from\r\nthe south-west, as the wind shifts round northward to north-east, the\r\nbarometer rises—it rises to west, north-west, north, and north-east.\r\n\r\n“The effect of the wind thus shifting round when traced upon paper by a\r\ncurve, seems certainly wave-like to the eye; but I believe it to be\r\nsimply consequent on the wind shifting round the compass, and\r\nindicating alteration in the barometric column.\r\n\r\n“If the wind remained north-east, say three weeks, there would be no\r\nwave at all—there would be almost a straight line along a diagram\r\n(varying only a little for _strength_). The atmospheric line, in such a\r\ncase, remains at the same height, and the barometer remains at 30\r\ninches and (say) some three or four-tenths, for weeks together. So\r\nlikewise when the wind is south-westerly a long time, or near that\r\npoint, the atmospheric line remains _low_, towards 29 inches. Thus,\r\nsuch ‘atmospheric waves’ may be an optical delusion.\r\n\r\n“The diagram alluded to above shows how the barometer and thermometer\r\nmay be used in connection with each other in foretelling wind, and\r\nconsequently weather, that is coming on, because _as the one rises, the\r\nother_ generally _falls_, and if you take the two together and confront\r\nwith their indications the amount of moisture in the air at any time,\r\nyou will scarcely be mistaken in knowing what kind of weather you are\r\nlikely to have for the _next two or three days_, which for the\r\ngardener, the farmer, soldier, sailor, and traveller must be frequently\r\nof considerable importance.”[14]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 14: The late Admiral Fitzroy.]\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to M. Buys Ballot, a Dutch meteorologist, for an\r\ninvaluable generalization, the importance of which it is almost\r\nimpossible to over-estimate. This distinguished _savant_ says:—“It is\r\na fact above all doubt that the wind that comes is nearly at right\r\nangles to the line between the places of highest and lowest barometer\r\nreadings. The wind has the place of lowest barometer at its left hand,\r\nand is stronger in proportion as the difference of barometer readings\r\nis greater.” These facts have been variously stated by other writers;\r\nfor example: “Stand with your back to the wind, and the barometer will\r\nbe lower on your left hand than on your right;” “Facing the wind the\r\ncentre of depression bears in the right-hand direction,” statements\r\nwhich can be verified at any time by a brief study of the “Weather\r\nCharts” now published in the daily journals. The value of the law\r\nconsists in its connecting the surface winds of our planet with the\r\nactual pressure of the air itself, and it admits of the following\r\ntabulation:—\r\n\r\n       +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n       | The wind is | The wind is | The wind is | The wind is |\r\n       |  NORTHERLY  |  SOUTHERLY  |  EASTERLY   |  WESTERLY   |\r\n       |  when the   |  when the   |  when the   |  when the   |\r\n       |  BAROMETER  |  BAROMETER  |  BAROMETER  |  BAROMETER  |\r\n       | is, in the  | is, in the  | is, in the  | is, in the  |\r\n       | N. ⎫        | N. ⎫        | N.

As introductory to the propositions,\r\nit should be stated that the positions of observations were the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n           Places.                   Latitude.    Longitude.\r\n           Nairn                     57°  29´ N.  4°  13´ W.\r\n           Brest                     48 „ 28      4 „ 29  W.\r\n           Valentia                  51 „ 56     10 „ 19  W.\r\n           Yarmouth                  52 „ 37      1 „ 44  E.\r\n           Portrush (or Greencastle) 55 „ 12      6 „ 40  W.\r\n           Shields                   55 „   0     1 „ 27  W.\r\n\r\nNairn and Brest are situated nearly on the same meridian, about 540\r\ngeographical miles apart. Valentia and Yarmouth are nearly on the same\r\nparallel of latitude, about 450 miles apart. Portrush and Shields,\r\ndistant 180 miles, are on a parallel which is nearly as remote from the\r\nparallel of Nairn as that of Valentia and Yarmouth is from the one\r\npassing through Brest; and Shields is about as much to the westward of\r\nYarmouth as Portrush is to the eastward of Valentia. When observations\r\nhave not been obtainable for Brest, those made at Penzance have been\r\nused instead.\r\n\r\n_Proposition 1._—Whenever the atmospherical pressure is greater at\r\nBrest than at Nairn, while it is of the same or nearly the same value\r\nat Valentia and Yarmouth, being gradually less from south to north, the\r\nwinds over the British Isles are _westerly_.\r\n\r\n_Proposition 2._—Whenever the pressure at Nairn is greater than at\r\nBrest, while its values at Valentia and Yarmouth are equal, or nearly\r\nso, the winds over the British Isles are _easterly_.\r\n\r\n_Proposition 3._—Whenever the pressure at Valentia is greater than at\r\nYarmouth, while its values at Brest and Nairn are nearly equal, the\r\nwinds over the British Isles are _northerly_.\r\n\r\n_Proposition 4._—Whenever the pressure at Yarmouth exceeds that at\r\nValentia, while there is equality of pressure at Nairn and Brest, the\r\nwinds of the British Isles are _southerly_.\r\n\r\n_Proposition 5._—Whenever the pressure of the atmosphere is equal, or\r\nnearly so, at Brest, Valentia, Nairn, and Yarmouth, and generally\r\nuniform, the winds over the British Isles are variable in direction and\r\nlight in force.\r\n\r\nThe data from which the foregoing propositions were deduced, and indeed\r\nall other cases calculated by Mr. Strachan, show in every well marked\r\ninstance that when the atmospherical pressure was\r\n\r\n    (1) greater in the south than in the north, the wind had westing;\r\n\r\n    (2) greater in the north than in the south, the wind had easting;\r\n\r\n    (3) greater in the east than in the west, the wind had southing;\r\n\r\n    (4) greater in the west than in the east, the wind had northing;\r\n\r\n    (5) uniformly high, or uniformly low, variable light winds (with\r\n        fine weather in the former case, and vapoury or wet weather in\r\n        the latter).\r\n\r\n    Conditions (1) and (3) give winds from the S.W. quarter.\r\n\r\n    Conditions (1) and (4) give winds from the N.W. quarter.\r\n\r\n    Conditions (2) and (4) give winds from the N.E. quarter.\r\n\r\n    Conditions (2) and (3) give winds from the S.E. quarter.\r\n\r\nThese principles may be employed to set forth the mode of foretelling\r\nthe impending change of wind as regards its direction and force; for\r\nthe atmospherical pressure may change—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) uniformly over the whole area of observation;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) by increasing in the south, or (which causes a similar\r\n        statical force) by decreasing in the north;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) by increasing in the north, or (which has the same effect) by\r\n        decreasing in the south;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) by increasing in the west, or (which has the same effect) by\r\n        decreasing in the east;\r\n\r\n    (_e_) by increasing in the east, or (which has the same effect) by\r\n        decreasing in the west;\r\n\r\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Scale, 0 to 6.\r\n    |\r\n    |Pressure in pounds\r\n    | per square foot.\r\n    |     |\r\n    |     |Miles per hour.\r\n    |     |   |\r\n    |     |   |Seaman’s Nomenclature.\r\n    |     |   |         |\r\n    |     |   |         |Scale, 0 to 12.\r\n    |     |   |         |    |\r\n    |     |   |         |    | Beaufort Scale.\r\n ---+-----+---+---------+----+-------------------------------------------\r\n 0·0| 0·00| 2 |Calm     |  0 |\r\n    |     |   |         |    |\r\n 0·5| 0·25| 5 |Light Air|  1 | Just sufficient to make steerage way.\r\n    |     |   |         |    |\r\n    |     |   | Breeze  |    |\r\n 1·0| 1·00|10 | Light   |  2 | ⎧With which a ship with ⎫ 1 to 2 knots.\r\n 1·5| 2·25|15 | Gentle  |  3 | ⎨ all sail set would go ⎬ 3 to 4   „\r\n 2·0| 4·00|20 | Moderate|  4 | ⎩ in smooth water.      ⎭ 5 to 6   „\r\n 2·5| 6·25|27 | Fresh   |  5 | ⎧           ⎫ Royals, &c.\r\n 3·0| 9·00|35 | Strong  |  6 | ⎪In which   ⎮ Single Reefs and T.G.

The\r\nsame remark applies to areas of high pressure, which, however, very\r\nrarely occur in a well-defined manner over the British Isles.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the table on page 76, the scale 0 to 6 was formerly used\r\nby meteorological observers at land stations, and it was intended to\r\nexpress, when the square of the grade was obtained, the pressure of the\r\nwind as given in the second column.\r\n\r\n“The velocity is an approximation as near as can be obtained, from the\r\nvalues assigned by Neumayer, Stow, Laughton, Scott, Harris, James,\r\n&c.”[15]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 15: Strachan’s “Portable Meteorological Register,”\r\n   4th edition.]\r\n\r\nFew meteorological axioms are better established than that which\r\nembodies the fact that “every wind brings its weather,” and the primary\r\ncause of wind being the motion of the air induced by rarefaction, it is\r\nobvious that there is a constant tendency for the equatorial and polar\r\ncurrents in any locality to establish an equilibrium, and this\r\nconsideration is found to facilitate weather predictions for extended\r\nperiods. Thus, in consequence of the unusual prevalence of _east_ winds\r\nin the spring of 1862, a wet summer was predicted. The prediction was\r\nfully borne out by an incessant continuance of _south-west winds_, with\r\nclouded skies and the usual accompaniment of deluges of rain. These\r\nwinds continuing, with slight intermissions only, till the spring of\r\nthe following year, less than the usual number of south-west winds was\r\nlooked for during the summer; the result fully justified the\r\nanticipation, the summer of 1863 being fine and warm, especially during\r\nthe earlier portion. Similarly, without committing the inaccuracies of\r\nMurphy in 1838, the summer of 1877 may be reasonably expected to be a\r\ndry and cool one from the long continuance of warm and wet months in\r\nthe winter of 1876-7.\r\n\r\nThe scientific research and mechanical ingenuity directed of late years\r\nto producing trustworthy estimates of the direction, pressure, and\r\nvelocity of the wind, have resulted in the production of a series of\r\ninstruments, possessing great precision and accuracy.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 54.\r\n Wind Vane. Scale\r\n about 1/20.]\r\n\r\nThe _direction_ of the wind is indicated by vanes, a very efficient\r\nform of which is shown at Fig. 54, the _velocity_ by revolving cups,\r\nand the _pressure_ by the pressure plate and by calculation from the\r\nknown velocity.\r\n\r\nThe Pendulum Anemometer (Fig. 56) shows in a simple manner the\r\ndirection and pressure of the wind. The peculiarly shaped vane ensures\r\nthe surface of the swinging pressure plate B being always kept towards\r\nthe wind. The pendulum plate hangs, during a calm, quite vertically,\r\nindicating zero, and as the pressure increases it will be raised\r\nthrough all degrees of elevation from 1 to 12. The vane is perforated\r\nwith holes large enough to be visible at some distance from the ground,\r\nthe 5 and 10 being specially larger, so that the angle to which the\r\npressure plate is raised can be quickly noted.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 55.\r\n Compass Bearings.\r\n Scale about 1/20.]\r\n\r\nThere is a simple contrivance (for the convenience of travellers)\r\ncalled a Portable Wind Vane, or Anemometer, It is furnished with a\r\ncompass and bar needle, &c., and will tell the true direction of the\r\nwind to within a half point.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 56.\r\n Prestel’s Pendulum Anemometer.\r\n Scale about 1/12.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 57.\r\n Lind’s Anemometer. Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nLind’s Anemometer or Wind Gauge ranks among the earliest forms of\r\ninstruments designed to estimate the force of the wind. It consists of\r\na glass syphon, the limbs of which are parallel to each other, mounted\r\non a vertical rod, on which it freely oscillates by the action of the\r\nvane which surmounts it. The upper end of one limb of the syphon is\r\nbent outward at right angles to the main direction, and the action of\r\nthe vane keeps this open end of the tube always towards the quarter\r\nfrom whence the wind blows. Between the limbs of the syphon is placed a\r\nscale graduated from 0 to 3 in inches and 10ths, the zero being in the\r\ncentre of the scale. When the instrument is used, it is only necessary\r\nto fill the tube with water to the zero of the scale, and then expose\r\nit to the wind. The natural consequence of wind acting on the surface\r\nof the water is to depress it in one limb and raise it in the other,\r\nand the sum of the depression and elevation is the height of a column\r\nof water which the wind is capable of sustaining at the time of\r\nobservation. Sudden gusts of wind are apt to produce a jumping effect\r\non the water in the tube, and to diminish this the bend of the syphon\r\nis contracted. A brass plate is attached to the foot of the instrument,\r\nbearing the letters indicating the cardinal points of the compass, to\r\nshow the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson, of Armagh, introduced an instrument, in 1850, which\r\nconsists of four hemispherical copper cups attached to the arms of a\r\nmetal cross. The vertical axis upon which these are secured has at its\r\nlower extremity an endless screw placed in gear with a train of wheels\r\nand pinions. Each wheel is graduated respectively to 1/10th, 1 mile, 10\r\nmiles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles, and these revolve behind a fixed index,\r\nthe readings of which are taken according to the indications on the\r\ndials.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson entertained the theory that the cups (measuring from their\r\ncentres) revolved with one-third of the wind’s velocity; and this\r\ntheory having been fully supported by experiment, due allowance has\r\nbeen made in graduating the wheels so that the true velocity is\r\nobtained by direct observation.\r\n\r\nIn an improved form of this anemometer the hemispherical cups are\r\nretained, but the index portion of the instrument consists of two\r\ngraduated concentric circles, the inner one representing five miles\r\ndivided into 10ths, and the outer one bearing 100 divisions, each of\r\nwhich is equivalent to five miles. At the top of the dial is a fixed\r\nindex, which, as the toothed wheel revolves, marks on the inner circle\r\nthe miles (up to five) and 10ths of miles the wind has travelled, while\r\na movable index, which revolves with the wheel, indicates on the outer\r\ncircle the passage of every five miles.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 58.\r\n Improved Anemometer. Scale about 1/5.]\r\n\r\nThis instrument can be made very portable by removing the arms bearing\r\nthe cups, when the whole may be packed with iron shaft in a case 15 ×\r\n13 × 4 inches. It may be placed in any desired position by screwing the\r\niron shaft supplied with it into the hole provided for the purpose, and\r\nfixing the apparatus on a pole or on an elevated stand, if possible, in\r\nan open space exposed to the _direct_ action of the wind.\r\n\r\nIf, when placing the instrument, the hands stand at 0, the next reading\r\nwill, of course, show the number of miles the wind has traversed; but,\r\nshould they stand otherwise, the reading may be noted and deducted from\r\nthe second reading, thus: Suppose the fixed index points to 2·5 and the\r\nmovable index to 125, the reading after 12 hours may be 200 on the\r\nouter circle and 3·0 on the inner circle: these added together yield\r\n203. By deducting the previous reading 127·5, we have the true\r\nreading—viz., 75·5 miles as the distance travelled by the wind.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the velocity of the wind in this manner in miles per\r\nhour, the table on page 83, from Col. Sir Henry James’s “Instructions\r\nfor Taking Meteorological Observations,” will enable the observer to\r\ncalculate the pressure in pounds per square foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WEATHER NOTATION.\r\n\r\nThe following letters are used to denote the state of the weather:—\r\n\r\n _b_ denotes blue sky, whether with clear or slightly hazy atmosphere.\r\n _c_    „    cloudy, that is detached opening clouds.\r\n _d_    „    drizzling rain.\r\n _f_    „    fog.\r\n _h_    „    hail.\r\n _l_    „    lightning.\r\n _m_    „    misty, or hazy so as to interrupt the view.\r\n _o_    „    overcast, gloomy, dull.\r\n _p_    „    passing showers.\r\n _q_    „    squally.\r\n _r_    „    rain.\r\n _s_    „    snow.\r\n _t_    „    thunder.\r\n _u_    „    ugly, threatening appearance of sky.\r\n _v_    „    unusual visibility of distant objects.\r\n _w_    „    wet, that is dew.\r\n\r\nA letter repeated denotes much, as _rr_, heavy rain; _ff_, dense fog;\r\nand a figure attached denotes duration in hours, as 14_r_, 14 hours’\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nBy the combination of these letters all the ordinary phenomena of the\r\nweather may be recorded with certainty and brevity.\r\n\r\n_Examples._—_bc_, blue sky with less proportion of cloud; _cb_, more\r\ncloudy than clear; 2_rrllt_, heavy rain for two hours, with much\r\nlightning, and some thunder.\r\n\r\n                   VELOCITY AND PRESSURE OF THE WIND.\r\n\r\n    The Pressure varies as the Square of the Velocity, or _P_ ∝\r\n    _V_^2. The Square of the Velocity in Miles per Hour multiplied\r\n    by ·500 gives the Pressure in lbs. per square Foot, or _V_^2 ×\r\n    ·005 = _P_. The Square Root of 200 times the Pressure equals\r\n    the Velocity, or √(200 × _P_) = _V_.\r\n\r\n  The subjoined Table is calculated from this data, by COL.

by Smeaton and others. It does not,\r\nhowever, express the true relation, which has yet to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe Anemograph, or Self-Recording Wind Gauge, has for its object the\r\nregistration of the velocity and direction of the wind from day to day.\r\nFigs. 59 and 60 show the form designed and arranged by Mr. Beckley, of\r\nthe Kew Observatory, which has been adopted by the Meteorological\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 59.\r\n Anemograph. Scale about 1/20.\r\n Portion for exterior of observatory.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a set of hemispherical cups and vanes, which are exposed\r\non the roof of the house, and of the recording apparatus, which is\r\nplaced inside the house.\r\n\r\nThe motion imparted to the hemispherical cups by the wind is\r\ncommunicated to the steel shaft B, which, passing through the hollow\r\nshaft C, and having at its lower end an endless screw, works into a\r\nseries of wheels in the iron box D, which reduces the angular velocity\r\n7,000 times. At the required distance the motion, having emerged at E,\r\nis connected with F, where, by means of bevelled wheels, it moves the\r\nspiral brass registering pencil C, which is arranged so that each\r\nrevolution records 50 miles of velocity on the prepared paper H.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the wind is indicated by the arrow L, which is kept in\r\nposition by the fans M. These communicate, by an endless screw and\r\ntrain of wheels, through the shaft C and the box D to the recording\r\napparatus, consisting of a spiral brass pencil, which in one revolution\r\nrecords variations through the cardinal points of the compass, on the\r\nsame prepared paper as that which receives the record of velocity.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 60.\r\n Anemograph. Scale about 1/20.\r\n Portion for interior of observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe paper is held on the drum by two small clips, and may be readily\r\nchanged, by unclamping the cross V, without disturbing the drum or any\r\nother part of the instrument.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 61.\r\n Self-recording Magnetometer, Kew Observatory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VI.—ELECTRIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilbert, a physician of Colchester, first showed in 1600 that\r\nthe earth as a whole has the properties of a magnet, and consequently\r\nthat the directive action exerted by it upon a compass needle\r\nrepresents only a special case of the mutual action of two magnets. In\r\n1845, Faraday established the fact that susceptibility to magnetic\r\nforce is not, as was generally believed, confined to iron, nickel, and\r\na few other substances, but is a property of all substances. According\r\nto Balfour Stewart, auroræ and earth currents may be regarded as\r\nsecondary currents resulting from changes in the earth’s magnetism.\r\nMagnetic phenomena are included under the general term terrestrial\r\nmagnetic elements, and consist of magnetic declination, inclination,\r\nand intensity.\r\n\r\nThese are for convenience determined separately; the first by an\r\ninstrument called a _Declinometer_, and the second by an _Inclinometer_\r\nor _Dipping Needle_. The Declinometer is also made to serve the\r\nadditional purpose of measuring the _intensity_ of the earth’s magnetic\r\nforce, which it effects on a principle similar to that by which the\r\nforce of gravity is determined by the oscillations of a pendulum of\r\nknown length on any given portion of the earth’s surface. The\r\ndeclinometer needle is made to oscillate, and the number of\r\noscillations in a given time counted; due allowance being made for the\r\nstrength of the needle, it is obvious that the force which restores the\r\nneedle to rest can be estimated. To ascertain the angle of\r\n_declination_, the zero line of the compass card is made to coincide\r\nwith the geographical north and south line; and the angle which the\r\ndirection of the needle makes with this line is then read off on a\r\ngraduated circle over which the needle turns. The magnetic\r\n_inclination_ or _dip of the needle_ is estimated by observing the\r\ninclination to a horizontal plane of a needle turning on the vertical\r\nplane which passes through the magnetic north and south points.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 62.]\r\n\r\nFig. 62 shows a simple form of magnetic needle suspended on a fine\r\nsteel point, which is supported by a brass stand; the addition of a\r\ngraduated circle would constitute such an arrangement a Declinometer.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 63.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 64.]\r\n\r\nFig. 63 gives the appearance of the dipping needle, or Inclinometer,\r\nand Fig. 64 an arrangement by which both kinds of terrestrial as well\r\nas local attraction may be shown.\r\n\r\nThese components of the earth’s magnetism undergo not only an annual\r\nbut a daily and even hourly variation, apparently connected in some\r\noccult manner with the frequency of the sun’s spots. The needle\r\nsometimes suffers such exceptional perturbations as to suggest the idea\r\nof a magnetic storm. These disturbances are usually accompanied (in\r\npolar regions) by luminous phenomena called auroræ. Continuous\r\nautomatic records of them, therefore, is of great value, as\r\nfacilitating inductive research which may lead to valuable practical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Royal Society have adopted for the Kew and other\r\nobservatories the form of Magnetograph, or Self-recording Magnetometer,\r\nshown at Fig. 61, by means of which the variations just referred to are\r\nregistered by the oscillations of three magnets on photographically\r\nprepared paper, stretched on a drum revolved by clockwork.\r\n\r\nOne magnet is suspended in the magnetic meridian by a silk thread, and,\r\nby the aid of a mirror attached, it describes on the cylinder, moved by\r\nclockwork in the centre pier, all the variations in the magnetic\r\n_declination_.\r\n\r\nThe other two components of the magnetic force of the earth are given\r\nby the other magnets. That recording the vertical variations rests on\r\ntwo agate edges under a glass shade, while the horizontal component\r\nmagnet is suspended by a double silk thread, under the shade to the\r\nright of the picture, being retained by the tension of the thread in a\r\nposition nearly at right angles to the magnetic meridian.\r\n\r\nThe clock box in the centre covers the three revolving cylinders\r\nbearing the sensitive photographic paper, and to each magnet is\r\nattached a semicircular mirror, which reflects the rays from a gas jet\r\nto one of the cylinders, and thus describes by a curved line the\r\noscillations of the magnet. A second semicircular mirror is _fixed_ to\r\nthe pier on which the instrument stands, and consequently describes a\r\nstraight line, or zero, from whence the curves are measured.\r\n\r\nTo avoid errors attending sudden changes of temperature, underground\r\nvaults are always chosen for magnetic observations, and also on account\r\nof light being more easily and perfectly excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nSince the performance of Franklin’s famous kite experiment, by which he\r\ndetermined the identity of lightning with the electrical discharge from\r\na machine, much attention has been devoted, not only to that form of\r\natmospheric electricity which displays itself in the thunder-cloud, but\r\nto the electric condition of the air in all states of the weather.\r\nThese researches have established the fact that the air is always in an\r\nelectrical condition, even when the sky is clear and free from\r\nthunder-clouds. The instruments employed for ascertaining the kind and\r\nintensity of atmospheric electricity are called Electroscopes. Fig. 65\r\nshows a modification of Saussure’s Electroscope, the basis of which is\r\na narrow-mouthed flint glass bottle with a divided scale to indicate\r\nthe degree of divergence of the gold leaves or straws. To protect the\r\nlower part from rain, it is covered by a metallic shield about five\r\ninches in diameter. Bohnenberger’s Electroscope indicates the presence\r\nand quality of _feeble_ electric currents. Peltier’s Electrometer\r\nyields the same result by the deflection of a magnetic needle. This\r\nlatter has been in use at Brussels for thirty years, and at Utrecht for\r\ntwenty years, and is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 65.\r\n Electroscope.\r\n Scale about 1/7.]\r\n\r\nSinger’s Atmospheric Electroscope is an efficient form of the\r\ninstrument in which an ordinary gold-leaf electrometer has attached to\r\nits circular brass plate a brass rod two feet in length, with a clip at\r\nits upper extremity to receive a lighted paper or cigar fusee. The\r\nelectricity of the air in immediate contact with the flame, causes, by\r\ninduction, electricity of the opposite nature to accumulate at the\r\nupper extremity, where it is constantly carried off by the convection\r\ncurrents in the flame, leaving the conductor charged with the same kind\r\nand power of electricity as that contained in the air at the time of\r\nthe experiment. The principle of this method was initiated by Volta,\r\nand has been extended and applied by Sir William Thomson in his\r\nWater-dropping Collector, which consists of an insulated cistern from\r\nwhich water escapes through a jet so fine that it breaks into drops\r\nimmediately after leaving the nozzle of the tube. The result of this is\r\nthat in half a minute from the starting of the stream the can is found\r\nto be electrified to the same extent as the air at the point of the\r\ntube. The scale value of each instrument has to be separately\r\ndetermined by repeated comparative experiments, and involves much\r\ndelicacy of manipulation.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly important for the ordinary observer to know that the\r\noccurrence of thunder and lightning should be always noted in the\r\ncolumn headed “Remarks.”\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 66.\r\n Lightning\r\n Conductor.\r\n Scale about 1/10.]\r\n\r\nThe destructive effects of lightning are too well known to need\r\ndescription here; the means, however, by which these may be averted\r\ndemand a brief notice. Lightning when discharged from a cloud will\r\nalways choose the better of any two conductors which may present\r\nthemselves. The _stone_ of a church steeple and the _wood_ of a ship’s\r\nmast are bad conductors, but a galvanized iron wire rope is the best\r\npossible conductor, and accordingly this material is now generally\r\nemployed for the purpose. A lightning conductor consists of three\r\nparts: 1, the rod, which extends beyond the summit of the building, 2,\r\nthe conductor, which connects the rod with the underground portion, and\r\n3, the part underground. The connection between each of these must be\r\nabsolutely perfect, or the conductor will be faulty. The top is usually\r\nof solid copper tipped with platinum (Fig. 66), the body of galvanized\r\niron rope, so as to adapt itself to the inequalities of the building\r\nand yet have no sharp turns in it, while the part underground is of\r\nsolid iron rod. This latter portion should extend straight underground\r\nfor two feet, and being bent at right angles away from the wall, should\r\nrest in a horizontal drain 10 to 15 feet long filled with charcoal, and\r\nbe again bent downwards into a well of water. Should water not be\r\navailable, it should rest in the centre of a hole 15 feet deep and 10\r\ninches in diameter, tightly packed with charcoal, which, while\r\nconducting the electricity from the rod into the earth, serves also to\r\npreserve the iron from rusting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 OZONE.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, besides holding the vapour of water diffused throughout\r\nits mass, contains also minute traces of carbonic acid and ammonia, and\r\na very remarkable substance called Ozone. Oxygen, one of the component\r\ngases of the atmosphere, is capable of existing in two conditions; one\r\nin which it is comparatively passive, and another in which it possesses\r\nexceptional chemical activity, dependent apparently upon its electrical\r\ncondition, and in which state it possesses a peculiar smell which has\r\ncaused it to be named ozone.[16] The characteristic odour is always\r\nobservable near a powerful electric machine when it is being worked,\r\nnear a battery used for the decomposition of water, and in the air\r\nafter the passage of a flash of lightning. Its presence is most marked\r\nnear the sea-coast, and in localities remarkable for their salubrity;\r\nand on account of its influence on health, it has been proposed by\r\nSchonbein and others to include ozonometrical observations with the\r\nordinary meteorological observations.\r\n\r\n [Footnote 16: Greek _ozo_, I smell.]\r\n\r\nAlthough in minute quantities it is favourable to health, when existing\r\nin undue proportion it irritates the mucous membrane of the nose and\r\nthroat, producing painful sores. It attacks india-rubber, bleaches\r\nindigo, and oxidizes silver and mercury, differing in all these points\r\nfrom ordinary atmospheric oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe chemical energy it possesses (which exceeds that of ordinary oxygen\r\nas much as the latter exceeds atmospheric air as an oxidizing agent)\r\naffords the means of ascertaining its presence and quantity. It\r\nliberates iodine from its combination with potassium, and free iodine\r\ncolours starch a deep blue.\r\n\r\nSchonbein, the discoverer of ozone, found that when strips of paper\r\npreviously saturated with starch and iodide of potassium and dried were\r\nexposed freely to the air but protected from rain and the direct action\r\nof the sun, they underwent a peculiar discoloration (when immersed in\r\nwater) after an exposure of 24 hours. A scale of tints numbered from\r\none to ten afforded the means of comparative observation, and thus the\r\nOzonometer was constructed, and a means established of registering the\r\namount of ozone in the air of various localities from day to day.\r\n\r\nSchonbein also observed that the proportion of ozone was largely\r\naugmented after heavy falls of snow. For the exposure of the ozone\r\npapers, an ozone cage is employed, as shown at Fig. 67.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: 67.\r\n Ozone Cage.\r\n Scale about 1/6.]\r\n\r\nOzone may be prepared artificially as a disinfectant by cautiously\r\nmixing without friction or concussion equal parts of peroxide of\r\nmanganese, permanganate of potash, and oxalic acid. For a room\r\ncontaining 1,000 cubic feet, two teaspoonfuls of the powder, placed in\r\na dish and moistened with water occasionally, will develop the ozone\r\nand disinfect the surrounding air without producing cough.\r\n\r\nThe most important and interesting series of facts, however, connected\r\nwith ozone are those established by the researches of M. Houzeau, who\r\nstates:—\r\n\r\n    1. That country air contains an odorous oxidizing substance,\r\n    with the power of bleaching blue litmus, without previously\r\n    reddening it, of destroying bad smells, and of bluing iodized\r\n    red litmus.\r\n\r\n    2. That this substance is ozone.\r\n\r\n    3. That the amount of ozone in the air at different times and\r\n    places is variable, but this is at most 1/700,000 of its\r\n    volume, or 1 volume of ozone in 700,000 of air.\r\n\r\n    4. That ozone is found much more frequently in the country than\r\n    in towns.\r\n\r\n    5. That ozone is in greatest quantity in spring, less in\r\n    summer, diminishes in autumn, and is least in winter.\r\n\r\n    6. It is most frequently detected on rainy days, and during\r\n    great atmospheric disturbances.\r\n\r\n    7. That atmospheric electricity is apparently the great\r\n    generator of ozone.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of great interest in its bearings on health, and\r\nopens a wide field of scientific research, as may be inferred from the\r\nopinion expressed by the Vienna Congress, which is that “the existing\r\nmethods of determining the amount of ozone in the atmosphere are\r\ninsufficient, and the Congress therefore recommends investigations for\r\nthe discovery of better methods.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lowe has published the valuable weather warnings tabulated on page\r\n94, which are interesting as showing from a given number of\r\nobservations the value of each phenomenon:—\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------+\r\n |                                          |    No. of    | Followed in |\r\n |                                          | observations.| 24 hours by |\r\n |                                          +--------------+------+------+\r\n | DEW.                                     |              | Fine.| Rain.|\r\n |   Dew profuse                            |      241     |  196 |   43 |\r\n |   Dew from 1st April to 30th Sept.       |      185     |  161 |   24 |\r\n |   Dew from 1st Oct. to 30th March        |       56     |   37 |   19 |\r\n | CLOUDS.                                  |              |      |      |\r\n |   White stratus in the valley            |      229     |  201 |   28 |\r\n |   Coloured clouds at sunset              |       35     |   26 |    9 |\r\n | SUN.                                     |              |      |      |\r\n |   Solar halos                            |      204     |  133 |   71 |\r\n |   Sun red and shorn of rays              |       34     |   31 |    3 |\r\n |   Mock suns                              |       35     |   19 |    6 |\r\n |   Sun shone through thin cirro-stratus   |       13     |    6 |    7 |\r\n |   Sun pale and sparkling                 |       51     |   27 |   24 |\r\n | FROST.                                   |              |      |      |\r\n |   White frost                            |       73     |   59 |   14 |\r\n | MOON.                                    |              |      |      |\r\n |   Lunar halos                            |      102     |   51 |   51 |\r\n |   Mock moons                             |        9     |    7 |    2 |\r\n |   Lunar burr                             |       64     |   47 |   17 |\r\n |   Moon shining dimly                     |       18     |   12 |    6 |\r\n |   Moon rose of a red colour              |        8     |    7 |    1 |\r\n | STARS.                                   |              |      |      |\r\n |   Falling stars abundant                 |       85     |   65 |   20 |\r\n |   Stars bright                           |       83     |   64 |   19 |\r\n |   Stars dim                              |       54     |   32 |   22 |\r\n |   Stars scintillated                     |       14     |   12 |    2 |\r\n | AURORA.                                  |              |      |      |\r\n |   Aurora borealis                        |       76     |   49 |   27 |\r\n | ANIMALS.                                 |              |      |      |\r\n |   Bats flying about in the evening       |       61     |   45 |   16 |\r\n |   Toads in the evening                   |       17     |   12 |    5 |\r\n |   Landrails clamorous                    |       14     |   13 |    1 |\r\n |   Ducks and geese noisy                  |       10     |    7 |    3 |\r\n |   Spiders hanging on webs in the evening |        8     |    5 |    3 |\r\n |   Fish rise in the lake                  |       15     |    9 |    6 |\r\n | SMOKE.                                   |              |      |      |\r\n |   Smoke rising perpendicularly           |        6     |    5 |    1 |\r\n +------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------+\r\n\r\nAmong the animals whose movements give weather warnings few are more\r\ntrustworthy than the leech. The reader may verify this by placing one\r\nin a broad glass bottle, tied over with perforated leather, or bladder.\r\nIf placed in a northern aspect, the leech will be found to behave in\r\nthe following manner:—\r\n\r\n1. On the approach of fine or frosty weather, according to the season,\r\nit will be found curled up at the bottom. 2. On the approach of rain,\r\nsnow, or wind, it will rise excitedly to the surface. 3. Thunder will\r\ncause it to be much agitated, and to leave the water entirely.\r\n\r\nPERIODS.—M. Köppen states, as the result of his examination into the\r\nchances of a change of weather, that _the weather has a decided\r\ntendency to preserve its character_. Thus, at Brussels, if it has\r\nrained for nine or ten days successively, the _next_ day will be wet\r\nalso in four cases out of five; and the chance of a change decreases\r\nwith the length of time for which the weather _from_ which the change\r\nis to take place has lasted.\r\n\r\nIn the case of temperature for five-day periods, the same principle\r\nholds good;[17] for if a cold five-day period sets in after warm\r\nweather, we can bet two to one that the next such period will be cold\r\ntoo; but if the cold has lasted for two months, we can bet nearly eight\r\nto one that the first five days of the next month will be cold too. The\r\nchance of change is, however, greater for the five-day periods than for\r\nsingle days. Similar results follow for the months, but here again the\r\nchance of change shows an increase.\r\n\r\n [Footnote 17: “Recent Progress in Weather Knowledge,”\r\n   by R. H. Scott, F.R.S.]\r\n\r\n“If we revert to the instance first cited, that of rain, the result is,\r\n_not_ that if it once begins to rain the chances are in favour of its\r\nnever ceasing; all that is implied is, that the chances are against its\r\nceasing on a definite day, and that they increase with the length of\r\ntime the rain has lasted. The problem is similar to that of human life:\r\nthe chance of a baby one year old living another year is less than that\r\nof a man of thirty.\r\n\r\n“The practical meaning of all this is, that although we know that a\r\ncompensating anomaly for all extraordinary weather exists somewhere on\r\nthe earth’s surface, _e.g._, the very common case of intense cold in\r\nAmerica, while we have a mild winter in Britain, there is no reason as\r\nyet ascertained to anticipate that this compensation will occur at any\r\ngiven place during the year. In other words, when definite conditions\r\nof weather have thoroughly established themselves, it is only with\r\ngreat difficulty that the courses of the atmospheric currents are\r\nchanged.”\r\n\r\nTo bring within the limits of a popular pamphlet a notice of the\r\nvarious phenomena classed under the head of Meteorology, it has been\r\nnecessary to exercise the utmost brevity. Brief, however, as the\r\ntreatment has been, reference has been made to the sciences of Heat,\r\nLight, Electricity, Magnetism, Gravitation, Astronomy, Chemistry,\r\nGeography, and Geology, thus corroborating the testimony of Sir John\r\nHerschel, who states that “it can hardly be impressed forcibly enough\r\non the attention of the student of nature that there is scarcely any\r\nnatural phenomenon which can be fully and completely explained in all\r\nits circumstances without a union of several—perhaps of all—the\r\nsciences; and it cannot be doubted that whatever walk of science he may\r\ndetermine to pursue, impossible as it is for a finite capacity to\r\nexplore all with any chance of success, he will find it illuminated in\r\nproportion to the light which he is enabled to throw upon it from\r\nsurrounding regions. But, independently of this advantage, the glimpse\r\nwhich may thus be obtained of the harmony of Creation, of the unity of\r\nits plan, of the theory of the material universe, is one of the most\r\nexalted objects of contemplation which can be presented to the\r\nfaculties of a rational being. In such a general survey he perceives\r\nthat science is a whole whose source is lost in infinity, and which\r\nnothing but the imperfection of our nature obliges us to divide. He\r\nfeels his nothingness in his attempts to grasp it, and he bows with\r\nhumility and adoration before that Supreme Intelligence who alone can\r\ncomprehend it, and who ‘in the beginning saw everything that He had\r\nmade, and behold it was very good.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   J.
