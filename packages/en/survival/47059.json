That is how the science of the atmosphere came to have its\r\npresent name.\r\n\r\nMeteorology is not a branch of astronomy. These two sciences are as\r\ndifferent from each other as zoölogy is from botany. They are both\r\nfounded on physics, and they “overlap” each other to some extent, just\r\nas every science does certain others; but if you want information about\r\nthe atmosphere, weather and climate, an astronomical observatory is not\r\nthe place to seek it; while if you wish to make inquiries about comets,\r\nsun spots, eclipses, standard time, or the date on which Easter fell in\r\nthe year 1666, do not apply to the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Washington the Government maintains an astronomical\r\nand timekeeping institution known as the Naval Observatory, and it\r\nmaintains in the same city the central office of the United States\r\nWeather Bureau. The two establishments are a mile apart in space and\r\nnearly a whole library apart in the subjects with which they are\r\nconcerned. The fact that their functions are persistently confounded by\r\nthe public indicates the necessity of writing this preface to a popular\r\nbook on meteorology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                           PAGE\r\n      I.

One has prevailed from time immemorial. The other\r\nis wholly modern. One is the popular view, the other the scientific.\r\n\r\nAncient philosophers regarded air as one of the four “elements” of\r\nwhich all things were supposed to be made. Average humanity, though it\r\ndid not concern itself with philosophy, must have begun, almost as soon\r\nas it realized the existence of air at all, to think of it as something\r\nthat, however it changed its state from hot to cold, dry to moist, pure\r\nto impure, was fundamentally uniform--a single entity. Certainly this\r\nidea is in full vigor today. The air that we breathe, supply to our\r\nfires, stir with fans, pump into bicycle tires, fly in--the air that\r\nasserts its independence of our will in the wind and the weather--gives\r\nus the impression of individuality. We instinctively rank it with water\r\namong the simple, definite things in the repertory of nature.\r\n\r\nEven the man of science often finds it convenient to discuss and deal\r\nwith air as if it were a single substance, but he is well aware that\r\nit is nothing of the kind. He knows that it is, in fact, a jumble of\r\ngases having very different properties. Some are heavy, others light.\r\nSome are chemically very active, others extremely inactive. Some\r\nare abundant, others very rare. These gases constitute the earth’s\r\natmosphere. Other planets have atmospheres that are quite different in\r\ncomposition from ours. The sun itself has a very complex atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s atmosphere is, then, a collection of gases, which are mixed\r\nbut not chemically combined. Some of them are themselves chemical\r\ncompounds. Each of these gases behaves very much the same as if the\r\nothers were not present, and each of them has its separate business to\r\nperform in the economy of nature. For example, a tree draws upon the\r\nstore of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere to build up its tissues.\r\nPresently the tree is cut down and its wood is burned for fuel. In this\r\nprocess a different atmospheric gas is brought into play. We often say\r\nthat the “air” supports combustion--that we supply “air” with a bellows\r\nto make a fire burn more brightly--but it is not the air as a whole\r\nthat enables things to burn. Four-fifths of the atmospheric substance\r\ntakes no part in the process. We burn with oxygen alone. So it is with\r\nbreathing. Oxygen and not air constitutes the breath of life.\r\n\r\nNear the surface of the earth the proportions of the more abundant\r\ngases mixed together in the air are remarkably constant. Ignoring a\r\nvariable admixture of water vapor, oxygen is always about 21 per cent,\r\nby volume, and nitrogen about 78 per cent. The remaining 1 per cent\r\nis mainly argon. At great altitudes, however, these percentages no\r\nlonger obtain. The atmospheric gases differ greatly among themselves\r\nin weight, and in the high atmosphere, where they are not mixed by\r\nthe winds, as they are below, the heavier tend to settle to the\r\nbottom and the lighter to float on top, as oil floats on water. It\r\nis calculated that at a height of thirty miles above sea level the\r\npercentage of nitrogen is about 86½ and of oxygen only 10, while at\r\nthe same altitude the gas hydrogen, which at low levels constitutes\r\nless than one-hundredth of 1 per cent of the atmosphere amounts to more\r\nthan 2½ per cent. Going higher, the percentage of hydrogen is supposed\r\nto increase rapidly, until, at an altitude of forty-eight miles, the\r\natmosphere is more than half hydrogen, and at eighty miles above the\r\nearth this gas forms 99 per cent of the whole. These figures are not\r\nnecessarily final; for some authorities believe that the atmosphere\r\ncontains an unknown gas lighter than hydrogen, while others think that\r\nthe hydrogen found in the lower air enters into chemical combinations\r\nbefore it can reach the higher levels; but it is beyond doubt that the\r\ncomposition of the upper atmosphere is quite different from that of the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nOf course almost any gas may be found locally and occasionally in the\r\natmosphere, but there are several that are always found wherever a\r\nrefined analysis of the air is made, and others that are generally\r\npresent. The following is a fairly complete list: Nitrogen, oxygen,\r\nwater vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, neon, krypton,\r\nxenon, niton (radium emanation), ozone, hydrogen dioxide, ammonia and\r\nother compounds of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nA number of these substances have only become known to science within\r\nthe last quarter of a century. Argon, though it constitutes nearly 1\r\nper cent of the atmosphere, escaped detection until the year 1894. The\r\ninvestigation of argon led to the discovery of some of the others. In\r\n1895 it was found that the air, as well as certain minerals, contains\r\nhelium. This substance was not new to science, but it had never before\r\nbeen found on earth. It was discovered in the atmosphere of the sun, by\r\nmeans of the spectroscope, as early as 1868. Terrestrial helium, neon,\r\nkrypton, and xenon were all discovered by Sir William Ramsay, who also\r\nshared with Lord Rayleigh the distinction of discovering argon.\r\n\r\nRamsay has published the following figures for the proportions in which\r\nsome of the rare gases exist in the atmosphere:\r\n\r\n  Helium     1 part in     245,320 by volume\r\n  Neon       1   “          80,800  “    “\r\n  Krypton    1   “       2,000,000  “    “\r\n  Xenon      1   “      17,000,000  “    “\r\n\r\nNiton, or radium emanation, is one of the products of the\r\ndisintegration of radium. Niton itself disintegrates very rapidly,\r\none-half of any given quantity disappearing in about four days, and one\r\nof its products is helium. The amount of niton in the atmosphere is\r\nnever more than an infinitesimal trace. Thus we are told that the total\r\nquantity of this substance present in the atmosphere of the whole earth\r\nup to an altitude of one kilometer (0.6 mile) weighs less than nine\r\nounces, and that each cubic centimeter of air contains among its thirty\r\nmillion million million molecules only between one and two molecules of\r\nniton, on an average.\r\n\r\nTurning, now, to the more abundant constituents of the atmosphere, we\r\nfind that oxygen and nitrogen differ strikingly from each other in\r\nthe fact that, while the former has a strong chemical affinity for\r\nnearly all other elements, the latter is chemically inert, having\r\nlittle tendency to unite directly with other elements, though by\r\nindirect processes, and chiefly through the agency of plants and\r\nanimals, a large number of nitrogen compounds are produced. Oxides of\r\nnitrogen are formed directly from the atmospheric gases by lightning\r\ndischarges, and these unite with the moisture of the air to form\r\nnitric and nitrous acids. A certain amount of ammonia (a compound of\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen) may also be formed by lightning from nitrogen\r\nand atmospheric water, but most of the ammonia in the air is derived\r\nfrom the decomposition of plant and animal matters. The compounds of\r\nnitrogen that occur in the air are washed down by rain in considerable\r\nquantities. Analyses of rain water made in different parts of the world\r\nshow from one to nine pounds of such substances per acre per annum.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide (more familiarly known as carbonic acid gas) occurs in\r\nthe atmosphere in the almost constant proportion of three parts in\r\n10,000 by volume. It is a little more abundant in the air of towns\r\nthan in the open country or over the ocean, and it undergoes slight\r\nperiodic variations, but the fact that it is not much more variable\r\nis rather surprising, considering that it is continually being added\r\nto and abstracted from the air by numerous agencies that have no\r\ndependence upon one another. It is supplied to the air by volcanoes,\r\nmineral springs, the combustion of fuel, the respiration of animals and\r\nplants, and the decay of organic matter. The amount supplied annually\r\nby the burning of coal alone is estimated to be equivalent to more\r\nthan one-thousandth of the total volume of the gas present in the\r\natmosphere at any one time. On the other hand, all green plants, in the\r\npresence of sunlight, withdraw carbon dioxide from the air, abstract\r\nthe carbon from it for the use of the plant, and return the oxygen to\r\nthe atmosphere. Thus it is estimated that an acre of beech forest takes\r\na ton of carbon out of the air annually. A vast amount of atmospheric\r\ncarbon dioxide enters into chemical combination with certain rocks\r\nat the earth’s surface. Lastly, a large quota of this atmospheric\r\ngas is absorbed by sea water, and certain authorities have seen in\r\nthis process a regulator of the total amount in the atmosphere, the\r\nhypothesis being that the ocean gives back some of the carbon dioxide\r\nwhenever this substance becomes deficient in the air.\r\n\r\nWater vapor--i. e., water in an invisible gaseous form--is always\r\npresent in the atmosphere, but its amount is subject to wide\r\nfluctuations. An important fact in this connection is that, at any\r\ngiven temperature, the air can hold only a definite amount of this\r\nvapor. This maximum amount increases rapidly with temperature. When the\r\nair is fully charged with water vapor it is said to be “saturated.”\r\nProperly speaking, the temperature limits the amount of the vapor that\r\ncan occur in a given space, regardless of the presence of the other\r\nconstituents of air, and in scientific language it is the vapor itself\r\nthat is said to be saturated, and not the air; but in a popular book\r\nabout the atmosphere, where much has to be said about atmospheric water\r\nvapor, adherence to scientific usage in this matter invariably leads\r\nto awkward complications. Speaking, then, in familiar terms--when the\r\nair is saturated with water vapor, a fall in temperature causes some\r\nof the vapor to condense in visible form, as cloud, fog, rain, dew,\r\nsnow, hail, etc. As the sole source of these various forms of moisture,\r\nand on account of the important part it plays in many atmospheric\r\nprocesses, water vapor is, from a meteorological point of view, the\r\nmost interesting constituent of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOne more atmospheric gas requires notice here, both on account of\r\nthe great popular interest attaching to it, and because of recent\r\nscientific discoveries concerning it--viz., ozone. This substance may\r\nbe described, in nontechnical language, as a concentrated form of\r\noxygen. It is one of the most powerful oxidizing agencies known, and\r\nhas found useful applications in medicine and various industries. Its\r\npopular renown, however, is due to the fact that for many years it was\r\nregarded as a great natural purifier of the atmosphere. “Life-giving\r\nozone” was reputed to be abundant in the air of forests, mountains, and\r\nthe seashore. Systematic observations were made of the prevalence of\r\nozone at different places throughout the world, generally by noting the\r\nchange of color of test-papers exposed to the air. These “ozonometric”\r\nobservations are now a closed chapter in the history of meteorology,\r\nfor it has been found that the reactions of so-called ozone papers\r\nare due chiefly or entirely to atmospheric substances other than\r\nozone. Moreover, direct examination of the air by more accurate\r\nmethods--including samples collected with the aid of kites and balloons\r\nup to a height of several thousand feet above the earth--shows that the\r\namount of ozone in the whole of the lower atmosphere is exceedingly\r\nsmall--much too small to be of hygienic significance. Whatever ozone is\r\nproduced from oxygen at such levels by lightning discharges or other\r\npossible agencies probably enters promptly into chemical union with\r\noxidizable substances and therefore has only a brief existence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the spectroscope has brought us evidence that far\r\naloft in the atmosphere, many miles above the earth, ozone is quite\r\nabundant. Here it is supposed to be generated by two agencies--the\r\nelectrical discharges of the aurora and ultra-violet radiations from\r\nthe sun. The ultra-violet rays that help to produce it are prevented\r\nfrom reaching the earth, and astronomers are thus deprived of much\r\ninteresting information they might otherwise obtain concerning the\r\nspectra of the sun and stars. However, as the present Lord Rayleigh\r\nhas pointed out, we can console ourselves for this fact by reflecting\r\nthat if the ozone did not shut off much of the ultra-violet light from\r\nthe sun, this light would probably ruin our eyesight; or, rather, we\r\nshould be put to the inconvenience of constantly wearing some sort of\r\nprotective spectacles in the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe high-level ozone is further interesting because of exercising a\r\ncertain control over the temperature of the lower air. It is more\r\ntransparent for incoming solar radiation than for outgoing earth\r\nradiation. Hence, when it is unusually abundant, it should raise the\r\ngeneral temperature of the earth. This presumably happens when the\r\ncondition of the sun is such that an unusual amount of ultra-violet\r\nradiation reaches the upper atmosphere, a fact that must be taken into\r\nconsideration in any attempt to establish a relation between climatic\r\nfluctuations and the sun-spot period.\r\n\r\nThe lowest part of our atmosphere is the densest because it is\r\ncompressed by the weight of the air above it. Thus it happens that,\r\nalthough the atmosphere is at least several hundred miles in height,\r\none-half of its mass--i. e., one-half of the quantity of matter in\r\nit, as expressed in terms of weight--lies below an altitude of about\r\n3½ miles above sea level, while about seven-eighths lies below the\r\nten-mile level. Above about five miles the atmosphere is too rare to\r\nsupport life. The highest clouds seldom occur higher than ten miles.\r\nStorms hardly ever reach that height. In short, the phenomena of life\r\nand the phenomena of weather are confined to a layer of air so shallow,\r\nin proportion to the dimensions of our globe, that on the surface of an\r\norange it would be represented by a sheet of thin paper.\r\n\r\nThe actual height of the atmosphere is not even approximately known.\r\nThere are theoretical reasons for believing that even at a height of\r\nthousands of miles above the earth there are molecules of atmospheric\r\ngases still under the control of the earth’s gravity, while at such\r\nlevels yet other atmospheric molecules are constantly escaping into\r\nouter space. At an altitude of fifty miles the atmosphere is less\r\nthan 1/75,000 as dense as at sea level--i. e., more than seventy-five\r\ntimes as attenuated as the best “vacuum” obtainable with an ordinary\r\nmechanical air pump. At 300 miles it is computed to be about one\r\ntwo-millionth as dense as at sea level.\r\n\r\nThe loftiest atmospheric phenomenon that we can observe directly is\r\nthe aurora, which has been photographed up to heights of more than\r\n300 miles. The altitude of the aurora is determined by simultaneous\r\nobservations made at two or more points, and the same is true\r\nof shooting stars and their trails, which seem to be especially\r\nnumerous between the levels of sixty and ninety miles. The so-called\r\n“noctilucent clouds,” which shone by reflected sunlight throughout the\r\nnight for some years after the great eruption of Krakatoa and were\r\nsupposed to consist of fine dust from that volcano, were probably about\r\nfifty miles above the earth. From the duration of twilight we infer\r\nthat above about forty-five miles the air is so tenuous that it cannot\r\nreflect sunlight to the earth. Clouds furnish information concerning\r\nthe movements of the air at various levels up to ten miles or more.\r\nObservations on mountains contribute further to our knowledge of the\r\natmosphere above the ordinary levels of habitation.\r\n\r\nOf all methods of exploring the atmosphere in a vertical direction,\r\nthe most fruitful is the use of kites and balloons. In recent years\r\ninvestigations of this character have become so extensive and so highly\r\nspecialized that they are regarded as forming a separate department\r\nof meteorology, known as Aerology. It is by virtue of developments in\r\nthis field that meteorology has become “a science of three dimensions.”\r\nFormerly meteorologists could do but little more than study the\r\n_bottom_ of the weather, so to speak; but now they observe it and\r\nchart it at all levels. The weather forecaster has daily reports of\r\nconditions aloft to aid his predictions both for dwellers on _terra\r\nfirma_ and for the aeronaut; while the accumulated data of upper-air\r\nobservations are throwing new light on many difficult atmospheric\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nScientific balloon ascents are no novelty. Some were made in the\r\neighteenth century, and many famous ones in the nineteenth, including\r\nthose of Biot, Gay-Lussac, Glaisher, Tissandier, and other daring\r\n_savants_. The “record” height for such personal ascents was attained\r\nin 1901, when Berson and Süring rose to 35,400 feet above Berlin.\r\nKites were sent up for meteorological purposes even before Benjamin\r\nFranklin’s immortal experiment in 1752. Modern aerological methods\r\nhave, however, little in common with these pioneer undertakings.\r\nExisting types of box kites, pilot balloons, sounding balloons, and\r\nself-registering meteorological apparatus for upper-air research were\r\ndeveloped in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but their use\r\ndid not begin to bulk large in meteorology until about the beginning of\r\nthe present century. The epoch-making event in these undertakings was\r\nthe discovery of the _isothermal layer_.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that the air is found to be colder\r\nthe higher one ascends in the atmosphere. Thus, even in equatorial\r\nregions, the tops of high mountains are mantled in perpetual snow. The\r\nrate of this temperature decrease averages about 1 degree Fahrenheit\r\nper 300 feet. Previous to the year 1902 meteorologists supposed\r\nthat the atmosphere continued to grow steadily colder in an upward\r\ndirection indefinitely; but in that year a Frenchman, M. Teisserenc de\r\nBort, who had sent aloft hundreds of small unmanned balloons carrying\r\nself-recording thermometers, announced that above a height of about\r\nsix and one-half miles the temperature ceased to fall. In fact, he\r\nfound that at about that level there was often a slight _increase_ of\r\ntemperature with increasing altitude for a certain distance upward, and\r\nthen a nearly uniform temperature as high as the balloons ascended.\r\nThis announcement was at first received with considerable skepticism,\r\nbut very soon similar observations were reported from other parts of\r\nthe world. A new “shell” of the atmosphere had been revealed--which,\r\nas subsequent investigations proved, differs from the lower air in\r\nother respects besides temperature--and it was at first named by\r\nits discoverer the isothermal layer. He afterward substituted the\r\nname _stratosphere_, now generally employed. In distinction from the\r\nstratosphere, the part of the atmosphere lying below it is called the\r\n_troposphere_.\r\n\r\nThe stratosphere has been explored in widely scattered parts of the\r\nearth, and information concerning it is daily accumulating. Although\r\nit extends over the whole world, the altitude at which it begins is by\r\nno means uniform. The altitude is greater in summer than in winter; it\r\nvaries with the barometric pressure at the earth’s surface; and it is\r\ndecidedly greater over the equator than over the poles. The last fact\r\nleads to an interesting paradox. Since over the equatorial regions\r\nthe temperature keeps on falling with ascent to a greater height than\r\nin other latitudes, it is here that the lowest temperatures in the\r\natmosphere are found. A sounding balloon sent up from Batavia, Java,\r\nin November, 1913, recorded 113° below zero Fahr., the lowest air\r\ntemperature ever observed. In middle latitudes the temperature of the\r\nstratosphere averages something like 68° below zero Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of this interesting upper atmosphere varies a good\r\ndeal, both vertically and horizontally, but never shows the steady\r\nvertical variation that characterizes the lower air. The stratosphere\r\ncontains no clouds (except occasional dust clouds), and has a\r\ncirculation quite distinct from that of the troposphere, the exact\r\nnature of which, however, has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\nThe sounding balloon, already mentioned, is one of the four principal\r\ntypes of aerial vehicle used in the study of the atmosphere, the\r\nothers being the pilot balloon, the captive balloon, and the kite.\r\nThe sounding balloon, or _ballon-sonde_, is a small free balloon\r\nthat carries no human aeronaut, but instead a set of superhuman\r\nmeteorological instruments, which register the temperature, the\r\nbarometric pressure, and sometimes the humidity continuously and\r\nautomatically through the whole course of their journey. The record\r\nis traced on a revolving drum or disk, usually coated with lampblack.\r\nIn its commonest form the balloon is made of india-rubber, and when\r\nlaunched is inflated to less than its full capacity with hydrogen. As\r\nit rises to regions of diminished air pressure it gradually expands,\r\nand it finally bursts at an elevation determined approximately in\r\nadvance. A sort of parachute, or sometimes an auxiliary balloon,\r\ninsures a gentle fall to the ground. Attached to the apparatus\r\nthere is generally a ticket offering the finder a reward for its\r\nreturn, and giving instructions as to packing and shipping. Sooner\r\nor later it generally comes back. In fact, the large percentage of\r\nrecords recovered, even in sparsely settled countries, is not the\r\nleast remarkable feature of this novel method of research. Thus, of\r\nseventy-two balloons sent up by a Franco-Swedish expedition in Lapland,\r\nforty-one were eventually recovered with their instruments. One of\r\nthese fell into a lake and was found after three years.\r\n\r\nNo instruments are carried by the pilot balloon, which merely serves\r\nto show, by its observed drift, the speed and direction of the air\r\ncurrents at different levels. The pilot balloon is sighted, while in\r\nflight, through a special form of theodolite, or, preferably, two\r\ntheodolites some distance apart. Several ingenious methods have been\r\ndevised for computing and plotting its actual course through the air.\r\nSuch balloons, apart from their use in scientific research, have become\r\none of the principal adjuncts of aeronautical undertakings all over\r\nthe world, and are also used by artillerists to enable them to make\r\nproper allowance for the deflective effect of the wind on the flight of\r\nprojectiles. Hundreds of thousands of pilot balloons were sent aloft\r\nfor military purposes during the world war.\r\n\r\nMeteorological instruments are sent up attached to kites or captive\r\nballoons whenever--as in connection with weather forecasting--the\r\nobservations must be obtained more promptly than would be possible with\r\nthe aid of sounding balloons, but such devices can attain only moderate\r\naltitudes. Kites have been raised to about four and one-half miles\r\nabove sea level, as compared with nearly twenty-two miles reached by a\r\nsounding balloon and twenty-four miles by a pilot balloon. The average\r\nheight of sounding-balloon ascents is about ten miles. As already\r\nstated, balloonists have risen to 6.7 miles. This is a little higher\r\nthan the best aeroplane record.\r\n\r\nThe use of the aeroplane for making meteorological observations is\r\nstill quite limited, but will inevitably increase. One other device\r\ngives promise of yielding valuable aerological information, on account\r\nof its ability to rise to extraordinary altitudes. This is a special\r\nform of rocket, recently invented by Prof. R. H. Goddard, which is\r\npropelled by several successive discharges of an explosive in the\r\ncourse of its upward flight, and with which the inventor thinks it will\r\nbe possible to explore the whole vertical extent of the atmosphere.\r\nMeteorological apparatus for use with the Goddard rocket has been\r\nplanned by Mr. S. P. Fergusson of the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere presses down upon the earth with a weight that, at sea\r\nlevel, amounts to about 14.7 pounds to the square inch, on an average.\r\nThis pressure is, at any point, exerted equally in all directions; it\r\nacts, for example, on the whole surface of the human body, and this\r\nmeans that a man of average size lives under a burden of some seventeen\r\ntons of air. He is not incommoded because the pressure from without is\r\nbalanced by that of the air that permeates his body.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the atmosphere decreases upward at nearly the same\r\nrate as its density. Thus on mountains and plateaus it is considerably\r\nless than in lowlands. At no place is the pressure invariable, nor\r\nis there a constant relation between pressure and altitude, but,\r\nknowing approximately the average atmospheric pressure over the\r\nearth’s surface, and knowing also the area of the latter, we can\r\ncompute in round numbers the total weight of the atmosphere--about\r\n5,000,000,000,000,000 tons. This is about 1/1,200,000 of the entire\r\nweight of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE RESOURCES OF THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the economic stress of our times much is heard about “natural\r\nresources.” This phrase suggests to most people’s minds the store of\r\nminerals, fuels, and oil locked up in the ground; the waters available\r\nfor drinking, washing, irrigation, power production, and navigation;\r\nthe forests and other natural growths of useful vegetation; and the\r\nsoil in which we raise our crops. A moment’s reflection, however,\r\nwill show that this is a one-sided enumeration. The resources of the\r\n_atmosphere_ are as essential to humanity as those of the land and the\r\nwaters, if not more so.\r\n\r\nThe coal that is dug out of the earth consists mainly of carbon,\r\nwhich, in bygone ages, was extracted by plants from the air. Moreover,\r\nit would be of no use to us if we did not have the oxygen of the air\r\nin which to burn it. Neither could we smelt metallic ores without\r\noxygen. All our forests and all our crops draw far more of their solid\r\nsubstance from the air than from the soil. Fuel and water are valuable\r\nsources of power, but so is the moving air that drives sailing ships\r\nand windmills, and the atmospheric pressure that helps to operate\r\nsuction pumps. It is the moisture of the air that feeds our streams\r\nand, directly or indirectly, waters all plants that grow upon the\r\nland. Lastly, it is the atmospheric oxygen that we breathe that keeps\r\nus from very speedily becoming incapable of using any of the other\r\nresources of Nature.\r\n\r\nAir and water together contain, in their oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen,\r\nand carbon, all the major constituents of our foods in unlimited\r\nabundance. It is tantalizing to think of the slow and roundabout way\r\nin which these things are wrought into edible shape--and the prices\r\nwe have to pay for them. No less tantalizing, when coal is scarce and\r\ncostly, is the thought that every vagrant breeze is laden with the\r\ncarbon dioxide from which the chemistry of living plants so readily\r\nextracts the chief element of fuels. The total carbon dioxide of the\r\natmosphere amounts to something like 2,200,000,000,000 tons, equivalent\r\nto 600,000,000,000 tons of carbon.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the utility of the air as a source of power. It is,\r\nperhaps, even more useful as providing an easy means of storing and\r\ntransmitting power. The engineer stores up energy in a mass of air\r\nby compressing it. When the air subsequently expands it gives up its\r\nenergy, and, in so doing, may be made to perform a variety of useful\r\ntasks. By a somewhat analogous process energy is applied to creating a\r\nvacuum, in order that the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere may be\r\nmade available for doing a particular piece of work. The suction pump,\r\nthe siphon, and the vacuum cleaner furnish examples of this process;\r\nand so do such familiar operations as sucking beverages through a straw\r\nand filling a medicine dropper.\r\n\r\nFrom crude types of bellows, with which, from remote antiquity, air\r\nwas compressed for the purpose of blowing fires, have been developed\r\na host of wonder-working appliances of the present day, such as the\r\nair brake, the pneumatic tube, the compressed-air locomotive, diving\r\napparatus, the caisson, certain kinds of refrigerating machinery, and\r\na long list of pneumatic tools. To cap the climax of ingenuity in this\r\nfield, methods involving both the compression and the expansion of air\r\nhave been discovered whereby this invisible, elusive substance may\r\nbe changed to a visible liquid and a visible solid; a process having\r\nextremely valuable applications, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nCompressed air, as a means of transmitting power, rivals such\r\nmechanical devices as gearing, belting, and rope drives, when it is\r\napplied near the compressor; or it may be conducted for many miles in\r\npipes, thus competing with the electric current; or, finally, it may\r\nbe transported in tanks to the place where it is to be used, a process\r\nanalogous to the use of the electric storage battery. Compressed air\r\nhas, moreover, certain advantages over other methods of transmitting\r\npower for a number of special purposes. Thus for use in coal mines it\r\nis safer than electricity because it is free from the danger of sparks.\r\nThere are a great many cases in which the air itself is used in the\r\nprocess to which the power is applied, as in different kinds of air\r\nblast, from the simple bellows to the blowers of blast furnaces; also\r\nin aerating apparatus, oil and fuel burners, spraying, cleansing, etc.\r\n\r\nA familiar form of air compressor is the hand pump used for inflating\r\nbicycle tires. This simple device illustrates two important facts;\r\nfirst, that a considerable amount of energy must be used to overcome\r\nthe expansive force of the air, and, second, that part of the energy\r\napplied to the pump produces heat. That the heat thus produced and\r\ndissipated in the surrounding air represents a loss of energy is\r\napparent; but energy is wasted in another way that is, perhaps, not so\r\nevident. When a gas is heated its expansive force is increased. Hence,\r\non account of the heating of the air in the tire, the pump has to do\r\nmore work to accomplish a given amount of compression than it would\r\nneed to do if the air remained cool.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this loss, the air compressors used for industrial\r\npurposes are provided with some sort of device for keeping the air cool\r\nduring compression. This is accomplished by a spray of water inside\r\nthe compressor cylinder, or, more commonly, by inclosing the cylinder\r\nin a water jacket. In producing high pressures, the air is compressed\r\nby degrees in two or more cylinders, and cooled between the successive\r\nstages. Lastly, before compressed air is applied to driving tools or\r\nmachinery, it is often reheated to increase its pressure. For most\r\nindustrial purposes the pressure of compressed air does not exceed 75\r\npounds to the square inch (5 “atmospheres”). For charging the tanks\r\nof compressed-air locomotives, for liquefying gases, and a few other\r\npurposes, much higher pressures are used. In laboratory experiments air\r\nhas been compressed to the enormous pressure of 60,000 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch, or 4,000 atmospheres. At a pressure of 14,000 pounds to\r\nthe square inch compressed air has been successfully used for blasting\r\nin mines in place of ordinary explosives.\r\n\r\nThe use of pneumatic tools began in the sixties of the last century,\r\nwhen pneumatic drills were employed with conspicuous success in the\r\nconstruction of the Mont Cenis and Hoosac tunnels. Such tools are now\r\nindispensable adjuncts not only of tunneling and mining, but also of\r\nnearly every department of metal-working and wood-working, and have\r\ncontributed incalculably to the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nImagine a workman with an ordinary hammer driving such a tool as\r\na chisel, punch, or calking iron, and estimate the amount of work\r\naccomplished in the course of a day spent in this wearisome labor.\r\nThen consider how such operations are performed with the help of that\r\nversatile substance, air. The pneumatic hammer consists of a piston\r\nworking in a cylinder, to which compressed air is conveyed from a\r\ncompressor by means of a flexible hose. The hammer is so designed that\r\nthe air causes the piston to work back and forth with great rapidity.\r\nA chisel, rammer, or other percussion tool is loosely fitted in the\r\nnose of the hammer, so that the piston will strike it a blow at each\r\nforward motion. The workman has nothing to do but hold the tools in\r\nplace. With a common hammer or mallet a workman will strike from twenty\r\nto a hundred blows a minute, according to the nature of the work. The\r\nspeed of the pneumatic hammer ranges from 1,000 to 20,000 blows per\r\nminute, so that its sound is a continuous buzz. Such hammers are used\r\nfor calking, chipping, riveting, and a great number of other purposes.\r\n\r\nIn another large class of pneumatic tools work is done by rotation\r\ninstead of percussion. The piston is replaced by a motor, which turns\r\nan auger, drill, or other tool for such operations as boring, screwing,\r\nreaming, etc.\r\n\r\nThe use of pneumatic tubes for transporting letters, parcels, and\r\nthe like, although suggested as early as 1667, has been in practical\r\noperation only since 1854, when a tube 220 yards long was built in\r\nLondon to convey telegraphic dispatches. The articles to be transported\r\nare placed in a carrier fitting closely inside the tube and propelled\r\neither by introducing air under pressure behind it or by exhausting\r\nthe air in front of it. Scores of miles of such tubes laid underground\r\nare now in operation in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, and other\r\nlarge cities for carrying mail matter. In the United States the\r\npneumatic cash carrier, used in stores, is the commonest application of\r\n“pneumatic dispatch,” as this system of transportation is called.\r\n\r\nThe use of compressed air instead of a brush for applying paint,\r\nvarnish, and whitewash is a further illustration of the versatile\r\npossibilities of air as a means of transmitting power.\r\n\r\nWhen an inclosed body of air or other gas is subjected to pressure,\r\nits volume is diminished and its density is increased. It is natural\r\nto inquire what will happen if the external pressure be increased\r\nindefinitely. Will the inclosed substance eventually cease to be\r\ngaseous and become a solid or a liquid? The answer to this question,\r\nfurnished about half a century ago through the researches of Thomas\r\nAndrews, is that no amount of pressure will liquefy a gas unless\r\nits temperature is below a certain point. This point, known as the\r\n_critical temperature_, is widely different for different substances.\r\nFor most of the atmospheric gases it is exceedingly low. Thus oxygen\r\nmust be cooled to 118° below zero Centigrade (180° below zero\r\nFahrenheit) before it will liquefy under any pressure, and the critical\r\ntemperature of nitrogen is still lower. Efforts to liquefy the gases\r\nof the atmosphere were unsuccessful for a long time on account of the\r\ndifficulty of attaining such low temperatures.\r\n\r\nNowadays the problem is so completely solved that the manufacture\r\nof liquid air is a commonplace commercial enterprise, and millions\r\nof gallons are produced every year. Liquid air is the principal\r\ncommercial source of pure oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases found in\r\nthe atmosphere. It is also used as a refrigerating substance in various\r\nindustrial and scientific processes, and new uses are being found for\r\nit from year to year.\r\n\r\nLike many other latter-day miracles, compared with which the alleged\r\nfeats of necromancy seem tame and puerile, the liquefaction of air is\r\nfounded on quite simple principles. The earliest commercial process\r\nwas invented, in its main features, by Linde in 1895, and the newer\r\nprocesses are merely modifications of this one.\r\n\r\nExperiments of the English physicists Joule and Thomson showed that\r\nwhen a gas under pressure is forced through a small orifice, beyond\r\nwhich it expands, it undergoes a certain amount of cooling. This fall\r\nin temperature, known as the “Joule-Thomson effect,” is generally quite\r\nsmall, but Linde devised a means of multiplying it in his “regenerative\r\ncooling process.” The air to be liquefied is first compressed to,\r\nsay, 100 atmospheres, cooled as much as possible by water, and passed\r\nthrough a long spiral tube. At the end of the spiral it escapes through\r\na small nozzle, and is thus somewhat further cooled by the effect above\r\nmentioned. This cooled air then passes back around the spiral tube, and\r\ncauses still more cooling of the air in the latter. The escaping air is\r\nagain compressed and goes through the same process as before. Thus its\r\ntemperature grows constantly lower, until finally the stream issuing\r\nfrom the nozzle is a liquid instead of a gas. The liquid collects in a\r\nreservoir, from which it can be drawn off when desired.\r\n\r\nThe liquid air thus obtained has a temperature of about 315° below\r\nzero Fahrenheit. It is generally drawn into a vessel called, from the\r\nname of the inventor, the Dewar flask, which is open at the top, but\r\notherwise insulated from the temperature of the surrounding air by\r\nhaving a double wall, with a vacuum between the walls. The familiar\r\nthermos bottle is constructed on the same principle. In such a vessel\r\nliquid air can be kept for hours and even days, and it is thus\r\navailable for use in many interesting laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nLiquid air looks much like water, except for its slight bluish color.\r\nIt boils--i. e., changes back to ordinary air--at a temperature\r\nonly slightly above that at which it is produced, and this boiling,\r\nof course, goes on rapidly at the surface of the liquid, owing to\r\nabsorption of heat from the air above. Liquid air is lighter than\r\nwater, upon which it consequently will float. A cubic foot of liquid\r\nair is the equivalent of about 800 cubic feet of ordinary air at 60°\r\nFahrenheit and atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe curious effects of liquid air, only a few of which can be mentioned\r\nhere, are not irrelevant to the subject of atmospheric resources,\r\nsince they aid in various ways in carrying out important scientific\r\nresearches. Almost all liquids are solidified and almost all solids are\r\nhardened and stiffened by immersion in liquid air. Alcohol is promptly\r\nfrozen in it, and at the same time gives out so much heat that the\r\nliquid air boils violently and the congealing alcohol overflows the\r\nvessel in a little avalanche of snow. India rubber becomes as brittle\r\nas glass. Meats become so hard that when struck by a hammer they\r\nring like steel. Chemical action is enormously reduced by exposure to\r\nthe low temperature of liquid air, and so is the electric resistance\r\nof metals. One might suppose that such a temperature would be fatal\r\nto all forms of life, but this is not the case. A goldfish, frozen\r\nsolid in liquid air, revives and swims vigorously a few seconds after\r\nbeing replaced in water. Bacteria survive hours of exposure to the\r\ntemperature of liquid air, while the seeds of higher plants, even after\r\nseveral days of similar treatment, sprout the same as other seeds.\r\n\r\nMost of the atmospheric gases have not only been liquefied, but\r\nalso frozen solid. An important exception is helium, which has been\r\nliquefied only at a temperature of 452° below zero Fahrenheit. The\r\nremarkable feat of liquefying helium was accomplished in 1908 by the\r\nDutch physicist Kamerlingh Onnes, who subsequently, in his attempts\r\nto solidify this substance, attained the unprecedented temperature of\r\nless than 2 (Centigrade) degrees above “absolute zero,” or 456° below\r\nzero Fahrenheit, by the rapid evaporation of the liquid under greatly\r\nreduced pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPLORING THE UPPER AIR.

(_Photographs from U. S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\nAlthough, when air is liquefied, the oxygen and nitrogen are condensed\r\nsimultaneously, the latter has a lower boiling point than the former\r\nand therefore passes off more rapidly when the liquid is allowed to\r\nevaporate. This fact makes it possible to separate the two substances,\r\nby the process known as “fractional distillation,” and hence liquid air\r\nplants have been established for the special purpose of manufacturing\r\noxygen and nitrogen, for both of which there is a large and growing\r\ncommercial demand. Scores of millions of cubic feet of oxygen are used\r\nevery year in the wonderfully efficient process of welding metals\r\nwith the oxyacetylene blowpipe, the flame of which has a temperature\r\nof about 6,000° Fahrenheit. Most of the supply now comes from liquid\r\nair. An equally large amount is used in a recently introduced method of\r\ncutting metal. The object to be cut is first heated to incandescence,\r\nafter which a jet of oxygen is played upon it. The metal actually burns\r\naway in the stream, and a clean cut is made like that of a saw. It is\r\ninteresting to reflect, when we fill our lungs with oxygen in order to\r\nkeep our bodily machinery in operation, that the same atmospheric gas\r\nis applied to the building of motor cars, bicycles, safes, boilers, and\r\nbattleships. Cartridges made of lampblack, dipped for a few moments\r\nin liquid oxygen and then primed with a fulminate cap, constitute an\r\nexplosive as powerful as dynamite and much cheaper to produce. A small\r\npercentage of oxygen added to the air supplied to blast furnaces has\r\nbeen found to effect a great saving of fuel used in the furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METEOROGRAPH FOR USE WITH SOUNDING BALLOON.

Thus neon, on\r\naccount of its exceedingly small resistance to the passage of electric\r\ndischarges, is a promising substance for filling glow lamps; especially\r\nas means have been found of correcting the glaring red color of the\r\nlight which characterized the original neon lamps. Argon is likewise\r\nused for filling electric lamps.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using the unlimited store of atmospheric nitrogen for the\r\nbenefit of agriculture and the manufacturing industries has been very\r\nprominently before the public in recent years, and gained special\r\nnotoriety during the late war, when great efforts were being made\r\nto increase the supply of nitrogenous materials suitable for use in\r\nexplosives. Nitrogenous matters in the soil are indispensable to\r\nthe growth of plants, and as long ago as 1898 Sir William Crookes,\r\nin an address before the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, alarmed the world by pointing out the possibility of a general\r\nfamine owing to the prospective exhaustion of Chilean nitrates and\r\nother sources of nitrogenous fertilizers. Nitrogen also enters on an\r\nimmense scale into the composition of many industrial products besides\r\nexplosives. No wonder popular writers have dwelt upon the fact that\r\nthe atmosphere contains far more nitrogen than mankind needs for every\r\npossible purpose--actually something like 20,000,000 tons over every\r\nsquare mile of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nA widespread misunderstanding, however, prevails as to the problem\r\ninvolved in utilizing this supply of nitrogen. Free (i. e., uncombined)\r\nnitrogen is of no use as a fertilizer, and it cannot be readily used in\r\nthe arts. The process of extracting it from the atmosphere is an easy\r\none, thanks to the liquid air industry. The real difficulty is to make\r\nthis inert gas enter into chemical combination with other substances,\r\nforming useful compounds such as ammonia and nitrates; in other words,\r\nto “fix” it.\r\n\r\nAs we have stated on another page, lightning discharges cause nitrogen\r\nand oxygen to combine in the atmosphere, and perhaps also combine\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia. There is one other natural\r\nprocess by which atmospheric nitrogen is fixed. Certain species of\r\nbacteria are able to extract this gas from the atmosphere and combine\r\nit with other materials. Some of these bacteria are independent\r\norganisms, while others form colonies of parasites growing on the roots\r\nof higher plants, chiefly members of the pea family. In the latter case\r\nthe bacteria use the nitrogen of the air and carbohydrates drawn from\r\nthe roots on which they grow to form nitrogenous compounds, which are,\r\nin part, transmitted to the host plant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these natural processes do not suffice to maintain\r\nagricultural soils in a high state of fertility. Mineral deposits of\r\ncombined nitrogen are practically limited to the nitrate fields of\r\nChile, from which more than two million tons of nitrate of soda are\r\nexported annually; but this supply cannot last more than a few decades.\r\nCombined nitrogen in the form of ammonia is supplied on a large and\r\nrapidly growing scale from by-product coke ovens, and another perennial\r\nsource of nitrogenous matter is found in animal and vegetable refuse of\r\nall kinds, including fish scrap and slaughter-house refuse, garbage,\r\nsewage, manure, etc. Since, however, the demands of agriculture and\r\nthe manufacturing industries greatly exceed the total amount of\r\ncombined nitrogen obtainable from all these sources, the ingenuity of\r\ninventors has been spurred to the task of fixing atmospheric nitrogen\r\nby artificial methods, and several such methods have now been put in\r\noperation commercially. Their combined product at present constitutes\r\nnearly one-third of the total nitrogen supply of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed here to describe these methods in detail, but\r\nit may be mentioned that one of them, known as the “arc process,”\r\nimitates the action of lightning in combining the nitrogen and oxygen\r\nthat occur naturally in the air, while the others utilize nitrogen\r\nthat has been previously separated from the air by the liquid air\r\nprocess. The arc process requires, for commercial success, a large\r\nsupply of cheap electrical power, and it is at present almost confined\r\nto Norway and Sweden, where electricity is obtained from waterfalls.\r\nIn this process air is blown through a huge electric flame, spread\r\nout by a powerful electromagnet. The air yields nitric oxide, which\r\nis combined with water to form nitric and nitrous acids, and these\r\nsubstances are combined with others to form marketable products. The\r\nmost widely used fixation process, and the one which the United States\r\nGovernment proposed to employ in the large plants that were in course\r\nof construction in this country at the close of the war, is known as\r\nthe “cyanamide process.” This process requires, as a part of its raw\r\nmaterials, large supplies of limestone and coke, from which calcium\r\ncarbide is made in an electrical furnace. The calcium carbide, at red\r\nheat, absorbs nitrogen, forming an intermediate product from which, by\r\nfurther processes, are made ammonia and nitric acid. A third method of\r\nfixing atmospheric nitrogen, which has been applied on a vast scale\r\nin Germany and is now coming into use in other countries, is commonly\r\ncalled the “Haber process.” In this process nitrogen is combined with\r\nhydrogen, obtained from water, to form ammonia, the combination being\r\nfacilitated by the presence of what chemists call a “catalyzer,” i. e.,\r\na substance that enables other substances to combine without itself\r\nundergoing any change. Several different catalyzers have been used in\r\nthe Haber process.\r\n\r\nTwo or three other methods of nitrogen fixation are beginning to assume\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\nWhile the power of the wind holds an important place among the\r\nresources of the atmosphere, it cannot be said that the utilization\r\nof this resource has undergone developments in modern times at all\r\ncomparable with the striking inventions and discoveries we have just\r\nbeen recording, if we except the use of the wind in aeronautics.\r\nAtmospheric resources used by aeronauts will be discussed in subsequent\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThe chief use made of the wind to-day, as in ages past, is to propel\r\nsailing ships, and its use for this purpose is, of course, of less\r\nimportance, in a relative sense, than it was before the introduction of\r\nsteam. The importance of windmills has also greatly declined. This fact\r\nwas strikingly brought out some years ago when the United States Bureau\r\nof Statistics collected, through American consuls abroad, detailed\r\ninformation concerning the use of the windmills in foreign countries.\r\nIn most parts of Europe windmills are rapidly disappearing. In Holland,\r\nfor example, the traditional home of the windmill, the perpetual task\r\nof draining the polders is now performed by steam pumps, and the total\r\nnumber of windmills is estimated to be only about one-tenth what it was\r\ncenturies ago. Our own country is probably the only one in which the\r\nuse of windmills is increasing. The modern American windmill, with its\r\ndisklike assemblage of numerous light sails, and ingenious contrivances\r\nfor veering, reefing, etc., is a much more efficient contrivance\r\nthan the old-fashioned windmill; but its utility, like that of other\r\nwindmills, is limited by the irregular force of the winds.\r\n\r\nFor years the hope has been entertained that the windmill would\r\neventually become a common means of generating electricity, but this\r\nhope has not yet been realized, though isolated installations of this\r\ncharacter are in successful use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE AS A HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the atmosphere has assumed a new and\r\ntremendous importance in human affairs as a medium that affords\r\nfacilities for travel and transportation far superior, in many\r\nrespects, to those offered by the land or the water. The aerial\r\nhighways are now open for business and pleasure. This is a fact that\r\nthe majority of people find it difficult to realize. The navigation of\r\nthe air on a general scale has so long been looked upon as a dream of\r\nthe future that we cannot readily adjust our minds to the reality.\r\n\r\nThe story of the slow steps by which this momentous fact has been\r\nbrought to pass is far too long to be told here. What we purpose to\r\ndo in the present chapter is to sketch the multifarious uses to which\r\nman is now applying the aeronautical knowledge and skill that he has\r\nacquired. At the same time we shall anticipate, to some extent, the\r\ndevelopments of the near future; for the lines of progress are so\r\nclearly marked out that it is possible to do this without giving too\r\nmuch rein to the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent chapter, dealing with Aeronautical Meteorology, we\r\nshall touch briefly upon the mechanical principles that underlie aerial\r\nnavigation, by way of preface to a more detailed description of the\r\nconditions of wind and weather encountered by aircraft, and of the\r\nservices that the meteorologist is rendering to the aeronaut.\r\n\r\nThe history of aeronautics may be divided into two periods, with the\r\nyear 1914 as the dividing line between them. Before the great war\r\nthe many brilliant minds that were trying to solve the problems of\r\naerial navigation received comparatively little help or encouragement\r\nfrom humanity at large. The airship and the aeroplane were both\r\naccomplished facts, but most people looked upon them as ticklish\r\ncontrivances of very little practical value. From the year 1909 onward\r\naviation occupied an immense share of public attention; liberal prizes\r\nfor aerial feats were offered; new records for speed, altitude, and\r\nendurance were made from day to day; but to the public, and perhaps to\r\nmost of the aviators themselves, all this meant merely that a new and\r\nthrilling sport had been created, rather than a new art of boundless\r\nutility. Very few business men felt inclined to invest money in the\r\ndevelopment of aircraft, and the governments of the leading nations,\r\nwith a single exception, were incredibly blind to the importance of\r\nbuilding air fleets for use in war. The exception was Germany, which\r\nnot only gave strong support to Count Zeppelin in the building of his\r\ndirigibles, but developed military aviation to such an extent that she\r\nentered the war with about 800 aeroplanes and a thousand trained pilots.\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of the war the budding art burst into vigorous bloom.\r\nUnlimited funds were now available for experimenting and building.\r\nThousands of flyers invaded the air, and the battle zone was a testing\r\nground on a vast scale, where one improvement was hardly introduced\r\nbefore it was replaced by another. Some of the best engineering talent\r\nof the world was diverted from many and various fields to the one task\r\nof supplying the demands of the military aeronauts for more speed, more\r\npower, more reliable motors, better materials and appliances. Thus the\r\nwar not only perfected aeronautics--especially aviation--as an art,\r\nbut practically created it as an industry. At the close of hostilities\r\nthe world found itself in possession of a vast fleet of aircraft, a\r\nmultitude of aircraft factories, and a great army of trained aeronauts.\r\nFor a time people asked--and perhaps some still ask--“What shall we do\r\nwith them?”\r\n\r\nThere are many answers to this question, and new ones are coming to\r\nlight every day. In the aggregate they mean that a new era has dawned\r\nin human affairs--the era in which the sky has been annexed to the\r\nworld in which man lives. Henceforth we shall have more elbow room. We\r\nshall no longer be imprisoned in Flatland, but set free in Spaceland.\r\nIt is impossible to foresee all the implications of this fact, but\r\nthose that are already apparent suffice to fill us with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSome of the most vexed problems of the present day will soon be\r\nsolved by aerial navigation. Take that of our overcrowded cities.\r\nEverybody knows how first the trolley car and then the automobile\r\nhelped to relieve the congestion of towns by making it feasible for\r\npeople to live many miles from the scenes of their daily work, but\r\nat the same time seriously swelled the traffic of the streets in\r\nbusiness quarters. Aircraft will bring far greater improvements in\r\nthis respect, without corresponding disadvantages. In a few years it\r\nwill probably be no inconvenience to live fifty or a hundred miles\r\nfrom one’s place of business. Aeroplanes, built for carrying several\r\npassengers in perfect comfort, _already_ fly at speeds of from 120\r\nto 150 miles an hour, and are almost independent of weather. Much\r\ngreater speeds will doubtless be common in the future. Automobiles,\r\nall running on the same level, have almost reached the limit of space\r\navailable in our busiest streets, and, under such conditions, they\r\nhave nearly lost the advantage of speed they once possessed over the\r\nobsolete horse-drawn vehicle. There can never be such crowding in the\r\nair. When a great volume of aerial traffic is concentrated toward the\r\ncenters of towns, people will fly their vehicles at various prescribed\r\nlevels, and probably “park” them on many-storied landing stages. New\r\nmethods of landing will undoubtedly be invented. The device known as\r\nthe “helicopter,” which has made progress toward the practical stage\r\nduring the past year, points out the possibilities in this direction.\r\nIn the helicopter the propeller blades revolve around a vertical shaft,\r\nthus permitting the vehicle to rise or descend vertically. A prize\r\nof $100,000 has recently been offered by M. Michelin, the well-known\r\nFrench patron of aviation, for the perfection of this device, which may\r\nsoon revolutionize the design of flying machines.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt Thomas, the Englishman whose foresight and enthusiasm have\r\ndone so much to hasten the arrival of practical commercial aeronautics,\r\nbelieves that in the near future the main airways of the world will be\r\nserved by airships rather than by aeroplanes. For long journeys the\r\nairship has the advantage that it can carry an ample supply of fuel\r\nwithout encroaching too much upon the space available for passengers\r\nand cargo. It is, therefore, especially suitable for transoceanic\r\njourneys. Hitherto airships, when not in flight, have been housed\r\nin enormous hangars, involving heavy cost of installation and their\r\nlanding has required the services of hundreds of men--an operation that\r\nwill probably seem laughable in its crudity to the next generation.\r\nThe airship of the future will probably never go into a hangar at\r\nall except for occasional overhauling, as an ordinary ship goes into\r\ndrydock. Hence only a few of these costly structures will be needed.\r\nWhile in service the airship will, on reaching an air port, moor\r\nherself at the bow to a great steel tower, and swing with the wind as a\r\nmarine vessel swings at her anchor. At the top of the tower there will\r\nbe a landing stage for passengers and freight, connected by lifts with\r\nthe ground below. From the main air ports, thus equipped, will radiate\r\nminor air routes, served by aeroplanes, and, in some cases, by flying\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nSuch landing places for airships were predicted by Kipling in his “With\r\nthe Night Mail”--but the author’s vista was of the year 2000! We are\r\nnot traveling so slowly as that. Consider what it means that the world\r\nheard with bated breath of Blériot’s flight over the English Channel in\r\n1909; and just ten years later men had flown over the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nWe have been writing of the future; but we need not look ahead for\r\nillustrations of the practical value of aerial navigation. Useful feats\r\nalready accomplished are so astonishing in their variety that they\r\nmake one cautious about assigning a limit to the possible applications\r\nof the new art. It has happened, for example, that a man who had\r\nbooked passage on a trans-Pacific steamer missed his boat at Seattle;\r\nwhereupon he hired an aeroplane, at a cost of $75, and overtook the\r\nsteamer on her way down Puget Sound, thus saving some weeks of delay\r\nin waiting for the next one. Another man, who produces honey on a large\r\nscale, found that spray-poisoned orchards were playing havoc with\r\nhis bees. He traveled in an aeroplane over the surrounding country,\r\nselecting stands for his hives at safe distances from such orchards,\r\nand he estimates that this precaution saved him $10,000 in a single\r\nyear. In August, 1919, a flying boat deposited a bag of mail on the\r\nWhite Star liner _Adriatic_ two hours after the ship had left New York.\r\n\r\nSeveral aerial mail routes are now in operation on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic. The first regular service of this character in America\r\nwas begun May 15, 1918, between New York and Washington, and during\r\nthe first year carried 7,720,840 letters, with few accidents and no\r\nfatalities. The first year of service cost the Government $137,900,\r\nand the sale of aeroplane mail stamps during the same period yielded a\r\nrevenue of $159,700. Out of 1,261 possible trips on this route, 1,206\r\nwere undertaken, and only fifty-five were abandoned on account of\r\nunfavorable weather. During 1919 the Post Office Department not only\r\nestablished other aerial routes, but relegated the aerial mail service\r\nto the ranks of the commonplace by reducing the postage on letters\r\ncarried by aeroplane to the ordinary first-class rate of two cents an\r\nounce.\r\n\r\nIn Europe lines of fast aeroplanes carrying mails, passengers, and\r\nfreight daily over regular routes are becoming part of the established\r\norder of things. The operators of a line between London and Paris,\r\nwhich was inaugurated in November, 1919, are now planning to establish\r\nan hourly service. Some of these lines have been equipped with wireless\r\ntelephony, so that the pilots can keep in constant communication\r\nwith numerous stations of the company along the route, and also\r\nwith one another. They are thus able to obtain, among other things,\r\ncurrent information about the prevalence of fog or other atmospheric\r\nconditions at points ahead of them. Presumably the passengers who\r\npatronize the aeroplane express will also, eventually, enjoy the use\r\nof the wireless telephone _en route_. In connection with the new air\r\nroutes suitable landing grounds, for regular or emergency use, are\r\nbeing laid out at short intervals; the ideal aimed at, for the present,\r\nbeing the so-called “ten-mile chain”; i. e., a series of emergency\r\nlanding grounds about ten miles apart. From ordinary flying levels a\r\npilot on such a route can always glide to one of these grounds in case\r\nhis motor fails. The landing grounds will be utilized, under certain\r\nrestrictions, for grazing cattle and for agricultural purposes, to\r\nhelp cover the cost of rental and maintenance. During 1919 the British\r\nGovernment established a chain of landing grounds in Africa, all the\r\nway from Cairo to the Cape.\r\n\r\nOne of the developments of the war was the use of aeroplanes for\r\nphotographic mapping. The aeroplane flies over a long tract of ground,\r\nand the camera, exposed vertically, takes pictures automatically\r\nat fixed intervals. The pictures thus taken are carefully joined\r\ntogether in a single strip. A second tract, parallel with the first,\r\nis photographed in the same manner, and so on, until the whole area\r\nhas been covered. Eventually all the pictures are assembled to form\r\na so-called “mosaic.” This process is highly successful for mapping\r\na flat country, but presents difficulties when there are hills and\r\nmountains. Some sort of stereoscopic process will probably be\r\nperfected for depicting accurately differences in level and producing\r\na “contoured” map. Although aeronautical mapping does not yet replace\r\nold-fashioned methods, it already has several obvious uses. It is\r\nespecially suitable for the revision of existing maps. Thus the plan\r\nof a city can be quickly brought up to date by this process. In the\r\nUnited States the Geological Survey has been engaged for many years in\r\nproducing large-scale topographic maps of all parts of the country.\r\nThis work proceeds slowly, and some of the maps are ten or fifteen\r\nyears old. The contours and other natural features on such a map are\r\nstill correct, but changes in the region due to the work of man are\r\noften extensive. Revision of these features can easily be made by the\r\nmethod above described.\r\n\r\nFor the preliminary mapping of a new country, by photography or by\r\nhand, the aeroplane offers the means of saving an immense amount of\r\ntime and effort. The surveyor no longer needs to cut tracks through\r\nthe jungle or scale mountains. No region is very difficult of access\r\nto the aviator. The summit of Mount Everest, the highest mountain\r\nin the world, is actually a mile lower than the greatest altitude\r\nattained by an aeroplane. Aviation has become an important feature of\r\nexploring expeditions. Captain Amundsen, the polar explorer, qualified\r\nas an air pilot before he embarked on his drift across the North\r\nPolar basin, and took aeroplanes with him on that journey. In India\r\nthe Survey Department has organized a regular aerial photographic and\r\nreconnoissance service, and has lately photographed the high waters\r\nof the River Sutlej in order to obtain data for a big electrification\r\nproject. Photographs of the Nile country have also been made for\r\nhydrological purposes. British aviators in Mesopotamia have mapped the\r\nflood boundaries of the Tigris and provided data for estimating crop\r\nareas. In the Philippines an engineer recently made a long aeroplane\r\nflight to determine which of three general routes was most suitable\r\nfor a new railway. Many months of time and thousands of dollars were\r\nthus saved, as it was only necessary to send out one party of locating\r\nengineers instead of three after the selection had been made.\r\n\r\nRecently the aerial surveyor has become the rival of the hydrographer\r\nin mapping shoals, channels, submerged rocks, and other features\r\nbeneath the water. If the water is clear and suitable atmospheric\r\nconditions prevail, objects submerged to a considerable depth may be\r\ndistinctly seen from an aeroplane flying far above the surface. It\r\nwas on account of this fact that Allied aviators were able to spot\r\nsubmerged German submarines during the World War. The camera, equipped\r\nwith proper plates and ray filters, can pierce the water even better\r\nthan the eye. Thus objects have been photographed at a depth of more\r\nthan 50 feet. British aviators charted the harbor of Rahbeg, on the\r\ncoast of Arabia, by the process in 1917. In this country the leading\r\nexponent of underwater photography is Dr. Willis T. Lee, of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, who has taken scores of photographs showing\r\nsubmerged features of the waters adjacent to Chesapeake Bay. It is\r\nlikely that rivers like the Mississippi, with ever shifting sand bars,\r\nwill soon be made safe by monthly or weekly mapping from the air. In\r\nearthquake regions, such as southern Italy and Japan, the changing\r\ncoast lines, shallows and harbors can easily be photographed after\r\neach new quake, thus keeping navigation open and protecting the lives\r\nof mariners.\r\n\r\nAnother application of this process of sighting submerged objects from\r\nthe air is the aerial fish patrol. The plan of using aircraft to locate\r\nschools of fish appears to have been first suggested by Professor\r\nJoubin, of the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, and it has been\r\ncarried out with much success in both Europe and America. Its promoters\r\nhope that it will eventually revolutionize the fishing industry and add\r\ngreatly to the world’s food supply. In the year 1919 seaplanes from the\r\nNorth Island Air Station at San Diego, California, made regular flights\r\nat an altitude of about 500 feet over the adjacent waters as an adjunct\r\nto the important fisheries in that vicinity. When a school of fish was\r\ndetected, the aviator dropped low enough to ascertain the species,\r\nand if it proved to be of a commercial kind, such as the sardine, the\r\nnews was flashed by wireless to the fishing fleet. The ocean in the\r\nneighborhood of San Diego was divided into numbered squares, shown on\r\ncharts, and locations were reported by number. In 1920 a daily patrol\r\nwas maintained by Navy seaplanes over the waters of Chesapeake Bay in\r\nbehalf of the menhaden fishery. According to an official report, “the\r\nexperiments fully demonstrated the commercial value of planes in this\r\nfishery.” It is believed that aircraft might be used with equal success\r\nin connection with the whaling industry.\r\n\r\nThe United States Forest Service has made considerable use of Army\r\naeroplanes and aviators in patrolling the great forests of the West,\r\nwhere a constant lookout for fires must be kept throughout the summer.\r\nThere are about 28,000 forest fires in this country every year, and\r\nthe average area burned over amounts to more than 8,000,000 acres,\r\nentailing an average annual loss of $10,000,000 worth of timber.\r\nObservations are maintained on mountain peaks and towers, but the\r\naerial watchman commands a much greater range of vision and can readily\r\ndetect fires in places such as deep canyons where they are, in many\r\ncases, hidden from the existing lookout points. When a big fire is\r\nin progress, the aviator can quickly ascertain its extent and report\r\nthe information by wireless to the fire-fighting forces. In case the\r\nfire is difficult of access on account of the absence of roads, the\r\nfire fighters can be transported to the spot in aeroplanes. It has\r\neven been proposed to fight forest fires by dropping bombs filled\r\nwith fire-extinguishing chemicals. At one time it was thought that\r\naeroplanes might largely replace fixed lookout stations, but experience\r\nshows that both systems of observation are desirable. Many foresters\r\nfavor the use of small dirigible airships in place of aeroplanes, owing\r\nto their ability to fly very low, when desired, land in any small\r\nclearing, discharge passengers by rope-ladder while hovering over a\r\nselected spot, and transport relatively large loads of men and supplies.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the valuable peace-time uses that have already been\r\nfound for the aerial vehicles that owed their production chiefly\r\nto the late war and for the host of pilots trained during the same\r\nconflict. Undoubtedly the immediate future holds far more interesting\r\ndevelopments in store.\r\n\r\nOne important practical aspect of aeronautics remains to be mentioned,\r\nand that is the question of safety. In their early days the steamboat\r\nand the steam railway were both risky contrivances. It is recorded\r\nthat at one time steamboats were barred from the Thames on account of\r\ntheir dangers. Undoubtedly the tradition of frequent boiler explosions\r\nlingered in people’s minds long after it had ceased to be a substantial\r\nfact. Aerial navigation--and particularly aviation--has now passed\r\nbeyond the pioneer stage, but it still bears the dubious reputation\r\nthat it acquired when it was in its infancy. Aerial travel, under\r\nstandardized conditions, is no longer unsafe. There are good reasons\r\nfor regarding it already as safer than automobiling. According to a\r\nreport of the British Department of Civil Aviation, there were 21,000\r\ncommercial flights in Great Britain during the six months from May 1\r\nto October 31, 1919, and 52,000 passengers were carried. The total\r\nmileage covered was 303,000. Not a single passenger was killed during\r\nthis period, and only ten were injured. There were two fatalities among\r\npilots and six pilots were injured.\r\n\r\nCommander Read, who made the first transatlantic flight, writes on this\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n“There are some pilots with whom I would refuse to risk my life.\r\nBut, given a modern machine with the proper attention paid it, and a\r\nskillful but conservative flyer, it is as safe a means of rapid transit\r\nas an automobile traveling at less than half the speed. Nowadays there\r\nis scarcely ever an accident in an aeroplane of standard type due to\r\nthe fault of material; they are all due to the inexperience or to the\r\ndare-devil stunting proclivities of the pilot--the pilot who ‘takes\r\nchances.’”\r\n\r\nAeronautics is now more than an art. It is a rapidly expanding branch\r\nof applied science. Aeronautical engineering has become one of the\r\nrecognized professions. Some of the leading government laboratories\r\nof the world, including the National Physical Laboratory in Great\r\nBritain and the United States Bureau of Standards, are devoting their\r\nattention to aeronautical research. There are also many unofficial\r\n“aerodynamical” laboratories for studying, with the aid of wind tunnels\r\nand other apparatus, the many problems pertaining to the physics of\r\nflight and the principles of aeroplane designing.\r\n\r\nAeronautical questions have begun to figure conspicuously in\r\njurisprudence. Legislators, as somebody has said, are busy making\r\nvertical laws to supplement the old-fashioned horizontal ones. In\r\ninternational law, especially, aerial navigation has given rise\r\nto thorny problems and it is already the subject of elaborate\r\ninternational agreements.\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects of flight and altitude have added a new\r\nchapter to the science of medicine. Seasickness has been the crux of\r\nthe ship’s doctor; will “air sickness” prove equally baffling? What are\r\nthe therapeutic possibilities of flying? Will physicians advise their\r\npatients to seek a “change of air” vertically instead of horizontally?\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, once monopolized by the birds, has become the abode\r\nof man. That is one excellent reason why everybody should acquire a\r\nknowledge of meteorology--the science of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDUST AND SMOKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the moralist reminds us that we are children of the dust and\r\npredestined to a dusty end, there is a grain of comfort in the\r\ndiscovery that modern science regards dust as one of the most important\r\nthings in the whole economy of nature. No longer does dust seem an\r\nappropriate symbol of insignificance and humility when one surveys the\r\nbulk of serious literature that has been written about it, considers\r\nthe caliber of the men who have devoted the better part of their lives\r\nto the study of it, or inspects the great array of ingenious apparatus\r\nthat has been devised for its investigation.\r\n\r\nThe dust of which we have to speak in the present chapter embraces all\r\nsmall particles of solid matter found anywhere, or at any time, in the\r\nearth’s atmosphere. Particular kinds of dust have, of course, their\r\nspecial names. Soot, the visible part of smoke, is a form of dust that\r\nhas played a very conspicuous part in human affairs; hence the separate\r\nmention of smoke in the heading of this chapter.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many agencies that help to charge the atmosphere with\r\ndust, the most important of them all is the wind. Let us see what\r\nhappens when the wind blows over the surface of a dusty road, for\r\nexample. If the air flowed in a smooth horizontal stream over such\r\na surface, its friction would drag the dust along on the ground,\r\nbut would not lift it. Such surface drifting, due to the horizontal\r\ncomponent of the wind’s motion, does, of course, occur, and its effects\r\nare strikingly visible in the shifting dunes that often form over a\r\nbroad surface of sand or snow. All winds near the earth’s surface are,\r\nhowever, full of waves and eddies, and in many cases, as over a stretch\r\nof strongly heated soil, there are strong updrafts, sometimes extending\r\nto a great height in the atmosphere. All kinds of dust are heavier\r\nthan air, and, contrary to popular belief, never truly “float” in the\r\natmosphere. Dust may enter the atmosphere at high levels, through the\r\ndisintegration of meteors, or it may be spouted up by volcanoes, but\r\ndust blown up from the earth’s surface rises only because the air is\r\nrising with it; and, in still air, all dust sinks more or less rapidly\r\ntoward the ground. The rate of its fall depends upon its specific\r\ngravity, and upon the size and shape of the dust particles. Other\r\nthings being equal, the finest particles fall most slowly. Exceedingly\r\nfine dust, even without upward air movements to support it, requires\r\nmonths or even years to fall to the ground from the higher levels of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nUpward movements in the air suffice to carry millions of tons of dust\r\naloft every year, and horizontal air currents carry the same dust\r\nfar and wide over the earth. The transportation of soil by the wind\r\nleads to some results of remarkable interest, practical as well as\r\nscientific. In the first place, far-reaching changes in topography are\r\nbrought about by this process. Thus in China vast areas are covered to\r\na depth of hundreds or even thousands of feet with a fine yellowish\r\nearth, called “loess,” which is believed to have been blown thither by\r\nthe winds from the deserts of Central Asia. Less extensive deposits of\r\nthis wind-borne material are found in many other parts of the world,\r\nincluding the Mississippi Valley. Another effect of wind transportation\r\nis the mixing of soils. There is a constant interchange of soil\r\nmaterial between different regions, so that the composition of the\r\nsoil on a particular farm, for instance, is not the same now that it\r\nwas a few years ago or that it will be a few years hence. Lastly, the\r\npresence of dust in the atmosphere, whether derived from the soil or\r\notherwise, has various interesting and important effects upon the heat\r\nand light we receive from the sun and modifies, in numerous ways, the\r\nconditions of human life upon our planet.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases in which enormous quantities of solid matter have been\r\ncarried to great distances by the wind have formed the subject of\r\nelaborate investigations on the part of meteorologists. Thus, during\r\nthe three days, March 8-10, 1901, heavy dust storms occurred in the\r\ndeserts of southern Algeria, and the sequel of these storms was\r\ncarefully studied by Hellmann and Meinardus. A widespread cyclonic\r\nstorm, central over Tunis at the time, sucked up the dust, which was\r\ncarried northward by the winds at high altitudes. Deposits from this\r\ndust cloud occurred over an area extending as far as 2,500 miles from\r\nthe place of origin. Reports collected from hundreds of observers\r\nindicated that 1,800,000 tons of dust fell over the continent of\r\nEurope, and one-third of this fell north of the Alps. As much more is\r\nbelieved to have fallen over the Mediterranean, while on the African\r\ncoast itself the deposit is supposed to have amounted to 150,000,000\r\ntons. In March, 1918, a shower of dust discolored falling snow at\r\nvarious places in the United States over an area of at least 100,000\r\nsquare miles, extending in an east-west direction from Dubuque, Iowa,\r\nto Chelsea, Vt. Reports of this shower were collected by Messrs. E. R.\r\nMiller and A. N. Winchell, who estimate that the amount of dust could\r\nnot have been less than a million tons, and may have been several\r\nhundred million. The dust is believed to have been blown up from the\r\narid regions of the far southwestern United States and to have been\r\ntransported a thousand miles or more.\r\n\r\nOff the west coast of Africa, between the Canaries and the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, haze due to dust blown up from the Sahara Desert is frequently\r\nencountered by vessels, especially during the first four months of the\r\nyear. This haze probably gave rise to the ancient legend of a Sea of\r\nDarkness--the _Mare Tenebrosum_--one of the mysterious terrors of the\r\nocean reported by the navigators who first sailed toward the New World.\r\n\r\nExtensive deposits of atmospheric dust have attracted attention from\r\nthe earliest times. Ehrenberg, in 1849, collected records of 349 such\r\ncases, and published a map showing their distribution, which embraces\r\nthe greater part of the world. Atmospheric dust is always brought down\r\nin greater or less quantities by rain. When it consists of fine powdery\r\nsand, the rain sometimes acquires a brownish or reddish tinge, staining\r\nobjects on which it falls and constituting the “showers of blood” that\r\nhave been regarded as prodigies from remote antiquity. Homer describes\r\nsuch a shower, and many similar occurrences are recorded by the Roman\r\nhistorians. Italy, owing to its proximity to the African coast, is\r\noften visited by these showers, which still strike superstitious terror\r\ninto the hearts of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe millions of meteors that enter the earth’s atmosphere every day\r\ncontribute their quota of dust, though the total amount is small\r\ncompared with that of the material lifted from the earth. Fine\r\nferruginous particles are often seen on the snowy summits of high\r\nmountains and the polar ice fields, and both their appearance and their\r\ncomposition indicate that they are derived from meteors.\r\n\r\nForest fires, burning peat beds, and other conflagrations on a large\r\nscale discharge quantities of dust into the atmosphere. Cinders from\r\nthe great Chicago fire spread over a large part of the globe. They are\r\nsaid to have reached the Azores some forty days after the beginning\r\nof the catastrophe. In Europe, the once common practice of burning\r\nthe moors to prepare them for cultivation gave rise to huge volumes\r\nof smoke, which was carried by the wind hundreds and even thousands\r\nof miles. The stronghold of this old custom--which still survives to\r\nsome extent--was East Friesland, in northwestern Germany, and the\r\ncharacteristic haze to which it gave rise, known as “moor smoke”\r\n(German, _Moorrauch_), was sometimes observed as far away as Spain,\r\nItaly, and Greece.\r\n\r\nThe famous “dark days” that figure in both ancient and modern history,\r\nthough in a few cases probably due to eclipses of the sun, have\r\ngenerally been the result of an abnormal accumulation of smoke or\r\ndust in the air; sometimes arising from volcanic eruptions, but more\r\noften from burning forests, moors, or prairies. Forest fires are the\r\nprincipal cause of dark days in the United States. Probably the most\r\ncelebrated of such days was May 19, 1780, when, in consequence of\r\ngreat forest fires along Lake Champlain and down to the vicinity of\r\nTiconderoga, darkness like that of night prevailed in New England.\r\nAll but the most necessary business was suspended, the schools were\r\ndismissed, and the greater part of the population flocked to church to\r\nprepare for the end of the world, which was believed to be at hand.\r\nThe great Idaho fire of August, 1910, was responsible for dark days\r\nover a larger area than in any other case on record in this country.\r\nArtificial light was required in the daytime over a broad belt,\r\nextending from Idaho to northern Vermont, but smoke was observed far\r\nbeyond this area. The British ship _Dunfermline_ reported that on the\r\nPacific Ocean, 500 miles west of San Francisco, the smell of smoke was\r\nnoticed and haze prevailed for ten days. When smoke in the air forms\r\na rather thin layer, through which the sunlight penetrates feebly,\r\nwe sometimes get an effect similar to the golden glow of sunset, a\r\nyellow or coppery tinge being cast over the landscape. Such was the\r\ncause of the “yellow day” still remembered in New England--September\r\n6, 1881--attributed to the burning of the immense peat bogs of the\r\nLabrador barrens.\r\n\r\nAnother occasional cause of atmospheric dustiness is the eruption of\r\nvolcanoes, especially those of an explosive character, which carry fine\r\ndust to heights at which it cannot be washed out of the atmosphere by\r\nrain. The remarkable dry fog of 1783--the most famous in history--which\r\ncovered the greater part of Europe and North America for three or\r\nfour months--was undoubtedly due to the violent eruptions of that\r\nyear in Iceland and Japan. Its connection with the Iceland eruption\r\nwas suggested even by contemporary writers. The outbreak of Krakatoa,\r\nin the East Indies, in 1883, spread a veil of dust over the greater\r\npart of the globe. For two or three years its presence in the air was\r\nthe cause of striking optical phenomena, including gorgeous sunset\r\nglows. The story is told of an American fire brigade which, deceived\r\nby one of these brilliant sunsets, set out to extinguish what was\r\nmistaken for a great fire in a neighboring village. A large species of\r\ncorona around the sun, known as “Bishop’s ring,” because it was first\r\nobserved by the Rev. Sereno Bishop of Honolulu, appeared shortly after\r\nthe eruption and reached its maximum intensity the following year.\r\nThis was due to the diffraction of light by the exceedingly fine dust\r\nfrom the volcano, and the same phenomenon has been seen after other\r\ngreat explosive eruptions; e. g., that of Mont Pelée, in 1902. Some\r\nauthorities believe that the finest particles of dust from the Krakatoa\r\neruption were carried to an altitude of over fifty miles above the\r\nearth, and remained suspended at very high levels for several years,\r\nconstituting the strange “noctilucent clouds,” seen on summer nights\r\nfrom 1885 onward. These clouds glowed with a silvery luster, attributed\r\nto reflected sunlight.\r\n\r\nA persistent veil of volcanic dust in the upper air is thought to\r\nexercise marked effects upon terrestrial temperatures, and prolonged\r\nperiods of intense vulcanism have been regarded as the cause, or one\r\nof the causes, of the recurrent ice ages of which geology furnishes\r\nthe record. This explanation of ice ages was advanced by P. and F.\r\nSarasin, in 1901, and was first put upon a scientific basis by Dr. W.\r\nJ. Humphreys in 1913; but the idea that volcanic dust might be the\r\ncause of cold seasons was suggested by Benjamin Franklin as early as\r\n1784. Franklin’s speculations on this subject were prompted by the cold\r\nwinter of 1783-1784, which followed the extraordinary fog of 1783,\r\nalready mentioned. Humphreys has published a list of all the great\r\nvolcanic outbreaks recorded since 1750, and has shown that each of them\r\nregistered itself in the temperatures of the earth and also, since\r\naccurate measurements began to be made of solar radiation, in these\r\ninstrumental records. Thus, the intensely cold winters of 1783-1785\r\nfollowed the tremendous eruptions of Asama, Japan, and Skaptar Jökull,\r\nIceland, in 1783; the famous “year without a summer” (1816) was the\r\nsequel of the gigantic outbreak of Tomboro, in the Sunda Islands, in\r\n1815, which is said to have hurled thirty-six cubic miles of solid\r\nmatter into the atmosphere; and definite periods of low temperatures\r\nand reduced sunshine were observed after the eruptions of Mont Pelée,\r\nin 1902, and Mount Katmai, Alaska, in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a volcanic dust veil in lowering temperatures on earth\r\nis attributed chiefly to the fact that, while the fine grains of dust\r\nare able to reflect back into space the short waves of radiation coming\r\nfrom the sun, they do not bar the passage of the long heat waves\r\nradiated outward from the earth. According to Humphreys’s calculations,\r\nsuch a veil is about thirtyfold more effective in shutting solar\r\nradiation out than in keeping terrestrial radiation in. This process is\r\njust the reverse of the familiar effect of the greenhouse; where the\r\nglass lets in the short waves of solar radiation but does not readily\r\nlet out the long waves of earth radiation.\r\n\r\nA small contingent of atmospheric dust consists of common salt (sodium\r\nchloride) due to the evaporation of spray from the ocean. This\r\nsubstance is frequently found in rain, as well as in samples of air,\r\nnot only near the seashore, but even in the interior of continents and\r\non high mountains. According to Du Bois the amount of sodium chloride\r\nannually deposited on the dunes of Holland is at least 6,000,000\r\nkilograms (more than 6,600 tons).\r\n\r\nOne of the striking phenomena of arid regions is the dust whirlwind;\r\nexemplified in the “devils” of India and South Africa, the “twisters”\r\nof Texas, etc. E. E. Free, in his treatise on “The Movement of Soil\r\nMaterial by the Wind” (U. S. Bureau of Soils, Bulletin 68), says of\r\nthese whirls:\r\n\r\n“They may be seen nearly every hot day, sometimes running rapidly over\r\nthe surface; sometimes remaining nearly, if not quite, stationary,\r\nbut never losing their rapid rotation. They usually last only a few\r\nminutes, but occasionally persist much longer. One observed by Pictet\r\nlasted for over five hours. They are largest and last longest on the\r\nflat, bare plains of the desert, and are usually seen in a calm or\r\nwhen only a light breeze is blowing, although their occurrence in\r\nwindy weather is not unknown. These whirls have been noticed by many\r\ntravelers in desert and steppe regions and have been carefully observed\r\nby Baddeley in India, and by Pictet in Egypt. They are frequent in\r\nChina and on the pampas of South America, and occasionally occur during\r\nthe dry season even in the humid regions. One of the most interesting\r\nphenomena in connection with the dust whirls is the occurrence of\r\nsystems of several whirls, each revolving rapidly about its own center\r\nand also moving about a common center in a more or less perfect circle\r\na few rods in diameter.”\r\n\r\nThe little whirls often seen on dusty roads are a miniature variety of\r\nthe same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nOne very important class of dust particles in the atmosphere consists\r\nof organic matter, living or dead, including the pollen of plants and\r\nthe countless myriads of microorganisms, as well as a variety of other\r\nproducts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. An abundance of pollen\r\nin the air accounts for the occasional fall of yellow rain, described\r\nas “sulphur rain,” “golden showers,” etc. The promptness with which\r\na piece of stale bread becomes moldy in a damp atmosphere is one of\r\nmany proofs of the omnipresence in the atmosphere of the microscopic\r\nspores of fungi, ready to propagate their species with amazing rapidity\r\nas soon as they light upon a suitable nutrient medium. Last, but not\r\nleast, bacteria, the most minute of all known organisms--so small that\r\nthousands or millions of them clustered together would make a mass not\r\nlarger than the head of a pin--swarm in the air, as they do in water,\r\nthe soil, and the bodies of animals. Fortunately, while certain species\r\nof bacteria carry disease and death with them, the great majority are\r\nharmless to mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AITKEN’S DUST COUNTER]\r\n\r\nA great many different methods are in use for determining the total\r\namount of solid matter present in a given volume of air, counting the\r\nnumber of particles, or gathering samples for microscopic examination.\r\nThus a known volume of air may be drawn through a filter of cotton\r\nwool or bubbled through distilled water, and the dust detained by the\r\ncotton or deposited in the water may be weighed. In certain types of\r\napparatus the air is drawn or forced against a plate or tube coated\r\nwith glycerin, oil, varnish, gelatin, or other adhesive surface, to\r\nwhich the dust remains attached. Several devices depend for their\r\noperation upon the fact that when a volume of confined air is cooled\r\nby expansion a point is eventually reached at which the water vapor\r\npresent condenses to form a fog, each droplet of which is supposed\r\nto have a single particle of dust as its “nucleus.” This is the\r\nprinciple involved in the well-known Aitken dust counter, which has\r\nbeen so extensively used in different parts of the world, and has\r\nfurnished most of the impressive statistics of air dustiness found\r\nin textbooks and reference books. Thus, from indications supplied by\r\nthis instrument, it is stated that a cubic inch of town air contains\r\n50,000,000 particles of dust; that a room, near the ceiling, was found\r\nto contain 88,000,000 particles per cubic inch; and that a cigarette\r\nsmoker sends 4,000,000,000 particles into the air at every puff. Recent\r\nauthorities are inclined to look upon these figures as misleading,\r\nfor the reason that the nuclei counted with Aitken’s instrument are\r\nprobably so infinitesimal in size that they hardly deserve to be called\r\ndust; indeed there is good reason to believe that an indefinitely\r\nlarge proportion of them may actually be molecules of gases.\r\n\r\nThe effects of dust, both inorganic and organic, upon the health of\r\nhumanity will be considered in another chapter. Certain kinds of\r\ndust are of economic importance on account of their inflammable and\r\nexplosive character when mixed with the right proportions of air.\r\nThus the cereal dusts made in the handling and working up of grain\r\ninto food products occasionally give rise to serious accidents. These\r\noccur in cereal, flour, and feed mills, grain elevators, starch and\r\nglucose factories, and on farms in connection with the use of threshing\r\nmachines. During a period of ten years, 1906-1916, cereal dust\r\nexplosions resulted in the loss of eighty lives and the destruction\r\nof property to a value of $2,000,000 in the United States. A study\r\nof this subject has been made by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, and various recommendations have been published with a\r\nview to preventing the occurrence of sparks in the neighborhood of\r\nthese dangerous dusts. Coal dust in mines likewise causes numerous\r\nexplosions. Preventive measures include wetting the dust, moistening\r\nthe air, and powdering the walls, roof and floor of the mine with a\r\nnonexplosive rock dust, which has the effect of stifling an incipient\r\nfire or explosion.\r\n\r\nThe last species of dust that we have to consider in this chapter is\r\none that constitutes a literal blot on civilization, since the noblest\r\ncities and monuments of mankind are defaced with it. Neither are\r\nthe evils of this kind of dust wholly æsthetic, for it is extremely\r\ninjurious to health and enormously expensive. After enduring coal\r\nsmoke as a necessary evil for generations, civilised humanity has\r\nnow embarked upon a vigorous campaign for its elimination, and very\r\nencouraging results have already been achieved in many parts of the\r\nworld. The war against smoke is carried on by numerous societies in\r\nEurope and America; a multitude of laws and ordinances (not all of them\r\neffective) have been enacted on the subject; it has been the occasion\r\nof international conferences and expositions; and its literature has\r\ngrown so copious that a partial bibliography of the subject, published\r\na few years ago by the Mellon Institute, of Pittsburgh, fills 164 pages.\r\n\r\nThe smoking of chimneys is costly, in the first place, because it is\r\ndue to imperfect combustion and the waste of part of the heating value\r\nof the fuel, and, in the second place, on account of the damage wrought\r\nby the deposit of the soot. Thus a smoky atmosphere entails big laundry\r\nand dry-cleaning bills, frequent repainting of houses, injury to metal\r\nwork, damage to goods in shops, and excessive artificial lighting in\r\nthe daytime. Throughout the United States it is said that smoke causes\r\nan annual waste and damage amounting to five hundred million dollars.\r\nIn Pittsburgh alone--before the reform produced by vigorous legislative\r\nand scientific measures, following an exhaustive investigation by the\r\nMellon Institute of Industrial Research--the cost of the smoke nuisance\r\nwas estimated at nearly ten million dollars a year. Means of mitigating\r\nthis evil include the introduction of improved appliances for burning\r\nsoft coal, and the use of other kinds of fuel. The electrification of\r\nthe railway lines entering cities is an important measure of relief.\r\nIt is estimated that more than one-third of the smoke found in certain\r\nAmerican cities comes from locomotives.\r\n\r\nSystematic measurements of the amount of solid matter contributed\r\nto the atmosphere by smoke have been made at various places in this\r\ncountry and abroad, and yield startling figures. Measures of the\r\n“sootfall” in Pittsburgh, before the evil there was mitigated, showed\r\nan annual average deposit amounting to 1,031 tons per square mile.\r\nLondon’s average is 248 tons per square mile for the whole city and\r\n426 tons in the central districts. In the heart of Glasgow the annual\r\nsootfall is 820 tons per square mile.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain measurements and analyses of soot and the study of\r\nits effects have been carried out on a large scale for a number of\r\nyears by the Advisory Committee on Atmospheric Pollution, attached\r\nto the Meteorological Office. The Committee has installed “pollution\r\ngauges,” of uniform type, at about twenty-five places in England and\r\nScotland. The soot that falls into these gauges is collected once\r\na month, weighed and analyzed. This organization also makes direct\r\nmeasurements of the purity of the air, and has acquired a unique body\r\nof observations that can be used to test the success of efforts made\r\nto abate the smoke nuisance, besides providing interesting comparisons\r\nbetween the incidence of respiratory diseases and the amount of solid\r\nmatter in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWEATHER AND WEATHER INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that a vast proportion of the conversations in which human\r\nbeings engage begin with remarks about the weather has often been\r\nnoted, but perhaps never fully explained. Meteorologists sometimes\r\nadduce this fact as evidence that weather is a subject of overshadowing\r\nimportance. This bit of reasoning will not, however, bear critical\r\nanalysis. It carries with it the implication that people talk about\r\nweather because weather is uppermost in their thoughts. How often is\r\nsuch the case? Brown, meeting Jones, remarks that it is a fine day. Are\r\nwe to infer that Brown was meditating upon the agreeable state of the\r\natmosphere before he vouchsafed this not altogether novel observation?\r\nHardly. There is about one chance in a thousand that weather was in his\r\nmind at all.\r\n\r\nIt is a plausible thesis that people talk so much about weather\r\nbecause, at an earlier period in the history of mankind, this subject\r\n_was_ of supreme importance. Perhaps it is a custom handed down from\r\nour remote ancestors, whose occupations were nearly all carried on\r\nout-of-doors and who enjoyed but a precarious shelter from the elements\r\nin their rude habitations. In India, as the period of the monsoon rains\r\napproaches, anxiety about the timely arrival and the abundance of\r\nthese showers eclipses all other thoughts in the mind of the peasant,\r\nbecause a severe drought at this season means a famine. When our\r\nforefathers lived by hunting, fishing, and crude systems of grazing and\r\nagriculture, they were, no doubt, equally solicitous about atmospheric\r\nconditions that directly affected their food supply. In those days\r\ncomments on the weather were by no means empty formulas. Men rejoiced\r\ntogether that the day was fine, because it was a circumstance upon\r\nwhich their dinner depended; and the prehistoric equivalent of “What\r\nbeastly weather!” was probably accompanied by a significant tightening\r\nof the belt.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that in very early times people gave a great deal of\r\nattention to the weather and acquired a fund of wisdom on the subject\r\nwhich, along with a certain amount of superstitious unwisdom, has come\r\ndown to us in the shape of weather proverbs. Many of these proverbs\r\nundoubtedly originated before the dawn of history, for they are found\r\nin substantially the same form among widely scattered races of mankind.\r\nVarious popular weather prognostics familiar at the present day are\r\nmentioned in such ancient documents as the Vedas, the Bible, and the\r\ncuneiform tablets from the library of Assurbanipal.\r\n\r\nSpeculations about the weather occupy much space in the writings of\r\nthe Greek philosophers, and a formal treatise on meteorology, written\r\nby Aristotle (fourth century B. C.), remained the standard work on\r\nthis subject for two thousand years. More or less systematic weather\r\nrecords were kept by the Greeks long before the Christian era, and they\r\nproduced a number of almanacs, in the shape of marble tablets, showing\r\nthe average winds and weather for particular dates throughout the\r\nyear. A copious collection of the weather indications found in both\r\nGreek and Roman almanacs, dating back to the fifth century B. C., has\r\nbeen made by Dr. Gustav Hellmann.\r\n\r\nSome of the meteorological instruments used today have a very\r\nrespectable antiquity. Ancient statistics of the rainfall of India,\r\nrecently brought to light, show that some sort of rain gauge must\r\nhave been in use in that country in the fourth century before our\r\nera. Measurements of rainfall were made in Palestine in the first\r\ncentury A. D. The only other meteorological instrument dating back to\r\nclassical antiquity, so far as known, is the weather vane. The Tower\r\nof the Winds, at Athens, built about a century before the Christian\r\nera, originally bore at its summit a vane in the shape of a bronze\r\nTriton, holding in his hand a wand, which was designed to point at\r\none or another of the eight symbolical figures of the principal winds\r\nsurrounding the octagonal tower, thus showing which way the wind was\r\nblowing at the time. The Roman writer Varro has left us a description\r\nof a vane that could be read indoors by means of a dial on the ceiling.\r\n\r\nInstrumental weather observations did not become the rule, however,\r\nuntil the end of the seventeenth century, when the use of thermometers,\r\nhygrometers, barometers, and rain gauges began in Italy and spread\r\nrapidly to other countries. The origin of each of these instruments is\r\ncommonly ascribed to a particular inventor--the thermometer to Galileo,\r\nthe barometer to Torricelli, etc.--but the truth is that the idea of\r\nthe instrument was, in each case, a slow growth, to which many minds\r\ncontributed. Thus a form of thermoscope--a device for showing but\r\nnot for measuring the expansion and contraction of air with changes\r\nof temperature--was described by Philo of Byzantium in the third\r\ncentury B. C. Galileo supplied such an instrument with a scale, but\r\nwithout fixed points, thus converting it into a crude thermometer, but\r\nit was not until half a century later that the Grand Duke Ferdinand\r\nII of Tuscany introduced the idea of filling the thermometer with\r\nalcohol, in place of air, and sealing it so that it was not affected\r\nby changes in barometric pressure. The thermometric scale now used in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries, which bears the name of Fahrenheit, appears\r\nto have been devised by the Danish astronomer Ole Römer, from whom\r\nFahrenheit borrowed it. In short, any _brief_ account of the invention\r\nof the principal meteorological instruments necessarily ignores the\r\njust claims of many inventors; to say nothing of the fact that what is\r\nwritten on the subject to-day is likely to be refuted to-morrow by the\r\ndiscovery of some forgotten book or manuscript.\r\n\r\nWe are on safer ground in saying that the plan of _measuring_ the\r\nweather, instead of merely observing it, became general early in\r\nthe eighteenth century; and that about the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the further improvement was introduced of making meteorological\r\ninstruments trace their own records, so that the human observer was, to\r\na great extent, dispensed with. Self-registering instruments are now\r\nthe rule at important meteorological observatories and stations, though\r\nthey do not, even yet, record all the elements of weather, and at a\r\nhost of minor stations none of them have yet replaced the eye of the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what things go to make up the weather, and how these\r\nthings are observed by the modern meteorologist.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the atmosphere, if not exactly a part of the weather,\r\nis so intimately associated with it that we cannot exclude it from our\r\nlist of weather phenomena. Atmospheric pressure is measured with the\r\n_barometer_, and the importance of this instrument as a key to weather\r\nchanges is fully recognized--and indeed overrated--by the layman, who\r\nsometimes calls it the “weather glass.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERCURIAL BAROMETER (Fortin type)]\r\n\r\nUntil recently all British and American barometers were read in\r\ninches and all others in millimeters. Since atmospheric pressure is\r\na force, the practice of measuring it in units of length is rather\r\nlike measuring time in bushels or potatoes in hours. The inconsistency\r\nis serious from a scientific point of view, because it divorces\r\nbarometric measurements from other physical measurements, in which\r\npressures are measured in units that have nothing to do with length;\r\nviz., dynes per square centimeter. Accordingly, some of the leading\r\nmeteorological services of the world have lately adopted a new unit\r\nof barometric pressure, known as the _bar_, which is equivalent to\r\n1,000,000 dynes per square centimeter. It is subdivided according to\r\nthe ordinary metric notation, and its most commonly used subdivision is\r\nthe _millibar_, equivalent to 0.03 inch on the old-fashioned barometer\r\nscale, under standard conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANEROID BAROMETER, GRADUATED IN MILLIBARS AND INCHES\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of sailors a curve is shown indicating the _mean annual\r\npressure_ in different latitudes along the meridian of 30° W. (Courtesy\r\nof the British Meteorological Office.)]\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barometer is so delicate and cumbersome that for many\r\npractical purposes it is replaced by the more convenient though less\r\naccurate _aneroid barometer_. A self-recording barometer (usually an\r\naneroid) is called a _barograph_. In its ordinary form, this instrument\r\ncarries a pen, which traces a continuous record of the barometric\r\npressure on a strip of paper wound around a cylinder turned by\r\nclockwork. Generally the instrument runs for a week before the paper\r\nhas to be changed. The barograph is a very instructive instrument,\r\nbecause it shows, not only the pressure, but also the _changes_ of\r\npressure--i. e., just how fast the barometer is rising or falling, or,\r\nas meteorologists say, the “barometric tendency.” The way in which\r\nbarometric changes are related to weather will appear in a later part\r\nof this book.\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barometer consists of a glass tube, sealed at its upper\r\nend and having at its lower end a “cistern,” which is open to the air.\r\nThe tube is filled with mercury at its open end, and then inverted over\r\nthe cistern, and the mercury descends until the weight of the portion\r\nstanding above the level of the mercury in the cistern just balances\r\nthe pressure of the air on an area equal to the cross section of the\r\ntube. The height of the mercurial column is read from a graduated\r\nscale attached to the tube. Certain corrections are applied to the\r\nreading, in order to eliminate variations due to temperature, etc.,\r\nand, if to be entered on a weather map, the reading is reduced to\r\nsea-level value. In the aneroid barometer, a thin-walled metal box,\r\nexhausted of air, undergoes changes of shape in response to changes\r\nin atmospheric pressure. The movements of the box are communicated by\r\nlevers to a pointer moving around a dial (or to the recording pen, in\r\nthe barograph).\r\n\r\nSince the pressure of the atmosphere diminishes with increasing\r\naltitude at a fairly definite rate, the barometer is used for measuring\r\nheights. Sometimes it is graduated directly, for this purpose, in feet\r\nor meters, and it is then called an _altimeter_.\r\n\r\nAmong the meteorological elements that unmistakably pertain to weather\r\nthe most important is the _temperature_ of the air. The thermometer,\r\nwith which temperature is measured, is, in its common form and in its\r\nessential features, too familiar to require description here; but we\r\nmay remark that, as in the case of the barometer, several methods of\r\ngraduating this instrument have been used. Besides numerous obsolete\r\nsystems, there are three different thermometric scales--the Fahrenheit,\r\nthe Centigrade, and the Absolute. The first is still the prevailing\r\none in English-speaking countries, and the second prevails in all\r\nother countries. The Absolute scale, long familiar to physicists, has\r\nrecently come into somewhat limited use in meteorology. It starts at\r\nthe “absolute zero”--the temperature of a body totally devoid of heat.\r\nThis temperature has been nearly attained in laboratory experiments\r\nwith liquid helium. One advantage that the Absolute scale possesses\r\nover the others is that it has no below-zero readings. Such readings\r\nare a source of occasional errors when temperature is recorded on the\r\nFahrenheit or the Centigrade scale.\r\n\r\nThe freezing point of water is 32° Fahrenheit = 0° Centigrade = 273°\r\nAbsolute. The boiling point of water, at sea level, is 212° Fahrenheit\r\n= 100° Centigrade = 373° Absolute.\r\n\r\nWhile the layman is well acquainted with the thermometer, he sometimes\r\nfails to understand certain differences between the scientific and\r\nunscientific methods of using this instrument for weather-measuring\r\npurposes. On a hot summer day he is, perhaps, inclined to feel\r\naggrieved because the official record of temperature does not\r\nadequately express the state of his feelings, to say nothing of being\r\nat odds with the impressive instrument displayed at the corner drug\r\nstore. Hence the following explanation is in order:\r\n\r\nIt is the function of the official thermometer to indicate the true\r\ntemperature of the _air_. A thermometer exposed to direct sunshine\r\nrecords its own temperature--i. e., the temperature of the glass and\r\nmercury--and nothing else. A thermometer “in the shade”--under a tree,\r\nfor example--comes nearer to showing the true air temperature; but it\r\nis exposed to radiation from surrounding objects and its readings will\r\nvary with the nature and location of these objects. The meteorological\r\nthermometer is nearly always installed in a kind of latticed screen,\r\nor shelter. It is thus largely protected from radiation, while the air\r\ncirculates freely around it. Only when thermometers are exposed under\r\nsuch standard conditions is it possible to obtain comparable readings\r\nof the temperature at different places, so that, for instance, maps may\r\nbe drawn showing the distribution of this element over a country. The\r\nbest location for the thermometer screen is a few feet above sod. Many\r\nthermometers of the United States Weather Bureau are installed on the\r\nroofs of tall buildings; not because this is an ideal location, but\r\nbecause no better is available in the heart of a large city, where, for\r\npractical reasons, the office has to be placed. In many small towns the\r\nsite of the station is such that the thermometer screen (or “instrument\r\nshelter,” as it is called in the Weather Bureau) can be placed close\r\nto the ground, and at the same time get ample ventilation and be free\r\nfrom the radiation of buildings. In certain large cities the Bureau\r\nmaintains a branch station in a park or in the suburbs, where a\r\nsatisfactory exposure for all instruments can be secured.\r\n\r\nThe artificial temperature of a city street is too local and indefinite\r\na thing to be inscribed on weather maps, utilized by the forecaster,\r\nor embodied in climatic statistics. As a concession, however, to the\r\ndemand of the “man in the street” for a record of conditions prevailing\r\nin his own sphere, the Weather Bureau has installed in several cities\r\nlittle pavilions in which working meteorological instruments are\r\ndisplayed for the benefit of the public. The thermometers in these\r\nso-called “kiosks”--which are modeled, with improvements, after the\r\nweather pavilions found at European health resorts--always read several\r\ndegrees higher in hot weather than the thermometer at the regular\r\nWeather Bureau station in the same vicinity. Such records are erratic,\r\nat best, and present indications are that the kiosks will eventually be\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETERS]\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary thermometer, there are instruments that answer the\r\nquestions “How hot was it to-day?” and “How cold was it last night?”\r\nThese are known, respectively, as the _maximum_ and the _minimum\r\nthermometer_. They hang almost horizontally in the screen. The former\r\nhas a constriction just above the bulb, which prevents the mercury\r\nfrom retreating after it has reached the highest reading for the day.\r\nIt can be reset by whirling it on a pivot. The minimum thermometer\r\nis filled with spirit instead of mercury. A little index inside the\r\ncolumn is carried toward the bulb by the surface of the alcohol as the\r\ntemperature falls. When the temperature rises the index remains behind,\r\nmarking the lowest point reached. The highest and lowest temperature\r\nof the day, as well as the temperature at any moment of the day,\r\ncan be read from the _thermograph_, or self-registering thermometer.\r\nIn the commonest type of thermograph changes of temperature alter\r\nthe curvature of a flexible metal tube filled with spirit, and the\r\nmovements of the free end of the tube are communicated by levers to a\r\nrecording pen.\r\n\r\nOn an average day, in our climates, the air is coldest about sunrise.\r\nThe appearance of the sun checks the atmospheric cooling due to the\r\nloss of heat from the earth that has been going on through the night,\r\nand the air begins to warm up. As long as the amount of incoming heat\r\nfrom the sun is greater than the amount of outgoing heat from the\r\nearth, the temperature will continue to rise. After noon, when the\r\nsun is highest, the supply of solar heat diminishes, but it is still\r\ngreater, for a time, than the heat loss from the earth, and for this\r\nreason the temperature, as a rule, keeps on rising until some time\r\ntoward the middle of the afternoon, when the maximum temperature of the\r\nday occurs.\r\n\r\n_Humidity_ is an element of weather that is more often talked about\r\nthan understood. Atmospheric humidity is the state of the atmosphere\r\nwith respect to the amount of moisture it contains in a gaseous form,\r\nnot in the form of a liquid. This gaseous moisture is called _water\r\nvapor_, and it is not directly perceptible to the senses, as liquid\r\nwater is. As we have explained elsewhere, the capacity of the air for\r\nwater vapor increases with the temperature. The actual amount present\r\nat any time, per unit volume, is called the _absolute humidity_, and\r\nthe ratio of this amount to the maximum amount the air can hold at the\r\nsame temperature is called the _relative humidity_. The latter is\r\ngenerally expressed in percentage. When the air is charged to its full\r\ncapacity with aqueous vapor its relative humidity is 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe relative humidity usually varies greatly through the day, being\r\ngenerally lowest when the temperature is highest, and _vice versa_. It\r\nis an element of much practical interest, because it is one of the main\r\nfactors in determining the drying power of the air, the other important\r\none being wind. The air feels dry when evaporation proceeds rapidly\r\nfrom our skin, either on account of low relative humidity, brisk\r\nair movement, or both. People are hardly conscious of high relative\r\nhumidity except when, in hot weather, it retards the evaporation of\r\nperspiration, and the latter collects in liquid form on the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERMOGRAPH]\r\n\r\nRelative humidity does not owe its importance in human affairs solely\r\nto its physiological effects, for it plays a prominent part in\r\nnumerous industries--textile, metallurgical, chemical, leather, food,\r\nand all those employing drying processes. In the spinning of cotton\r\nand wool, for example, the humidity of the workroom greatly affects\r\nthe weight of the material, the size of the yarn, and the length\r\nand flexibility of the fibers. Humidity must likewise be taken into\r\naccount in such diverse industries as manufacturing candy, bread, high\r\nexplosives and photographic films, drying macaroni and tobacco, and\r\noperating blast furnaces. There are engineers who specialize in the\r\nbusiness of installing “humidifying” and “dehumidifying” systems in\r\nworkshops, and also, for hygienic purposes, in schoolhouses and other\r\npublic buildings.\r\n\r\nThe absolute humidity, the relative humidity and the _dew point_ (the\r\ntemperature to which the air must be brought to start condensation\r\nof its moisture) are all determined by means of instruments called\r\n_hygrometers_. The hair hygrometer depends for its action upon the\r\nfact that a hair, freed from oil, not only absorbs moisture from\r\nthe atmosphere, but elongates when damp and contracts when dry. The\r\ninstrument, which includes a single human hair or a bundle of such\r\nhairs, is so designed that these changes move an index over a graduated\r\nscale. This and other types of hygrometer can be arranged to record\r\ntheir own readings continuously, constituting a _hygrograph_.\r\n\r\nThe form of hygrometer most commonly met with at meteorological\r\nstations is called a _psychrometer_. This usually consists of a pair\r\nof mercurial thermometers, one of which, known as the “wet-bulb\r\nthermometer,” has its bulb wrapped in thin muslin. The other, called\r\nthe “dry-bulb,” is an ordinary thermometer. The muslin is moistened,\r\neither just before making a reading, or continuously with a wick. In\r\nthe former case the thermometer is generally whirled several times\r\nbefore the reading is taken. Unless the air is saturated, the wet bulb\r\nis cooled by evaporation, and the difference between the readings of\r\nthe two instruments enables the observer, with the aid of suitable\r\ntables, to obtain the absolute and relative humidity and the dew\r\npoint. The most accurate results are obtained from the _aspiration\r\npsychrometer_, of Assmann, in which air is drawn past the bulb of the\r\nthermometer by a small fan, driven by clockwork.\r\n\r\nDeposits of liquid and frozen water from the atmosphere, in their\r\nvarious forms, are known collectively as “precipitation,” and in\r\nthe aggregate they constitute a feature of the weather hardly less\r\nimportant than temperature. Indeed an average rainstorm or snowstorm is\r\na more obtrusive event than any other equally common manifestation of\r\nthe weather; while an excess of precipitation or a prolonged lack of\r\nit, constituting a _drought_, may be as serious in its consequences as\r\na “hot wave” or a “freeze.”\r\n\r\nPrecipitation--familiarly called “rainfall”--is much more extensively\r\nmeasured than any other meteorological element, for there are,\r\nthroughout the world, a vast number of places at which this is the only\r\nfeature of the weather that is regularly observed. In Europe alone\r\nthere are about 19,000 “rainfall stations.” Rainfall is measured in\r\ndepth; viz., in inches or millimeters. A moderate shower of several\r\nhours’ duration will yield an inch or two of rain, while in extreme\r\ncases several inches may fall in an hour. Snow is sometimes measured\r\nas such--i. e., the actual depth that falls, or, more commonly, the\r\namount lying on the ground from day to day--but in order that records\r\nof snowfall may be combined with those of rainfall for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the total precipitation, the snowfall must be reduced to\r\nits “water equivalent,” either by melting the snow before measurement\r\nor by estimating this equivalent or by weighing the snow caught in a\r\nreceiver of known area and computing the corresponding depth of water.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of _rain gauge_. As a rule the gauge has a\r\nfunnel-shaped receiver with a small opening through which the water\r\nflows into the lower part of the gauge; loss of the accumulated water\r\nby evaporation is thus checked. There is usually some device for\r\nmagnifying the depth of rainfall in order to facilitate measurement.\r\nIn American gauges the rain flows into an inner tube having one-tenth\r\nthe horizontal area of the receiver, and its depth is thus magnified\r\nten times. A measurement is made by thrusting a graduated wooden stick\r\nto the bottom of the tube and noting the height to which the stick is\r\nwetted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIPPING-BUCKET RAIN GAUGE]\r\n\r\nOf devices for obtaining an automatic record of rainfall, the _tipping\r\nbucket_ (or, as the British call it, the “tilting bucket”) is probably\r\nthe most serviceable, and it is the one most widely used in this\r\ncountry. This instrument is as simple as it is ingenious. The “bucket”\r\nis a little metal trough, pivoted in the middle, so that it can tilt\r\nback and forth, seesaw-fashion. It is divided into two compartments by\r\na central partition. Rain falling into the funnel-shaped receiver at\r\nthe top of the gauge flows into whichever compartment of the bucket is\r\nuppermost, until the weight of the water causes the bucket to tip,\r\nthus emptying one compartment and presenting the other to the incoming\r\nstream. When the second compartment is filled, the bucket tips in the\r\nopposite direction. The parts of the gauge are of such dimensions that\r\neach tip of the bucket corresponds to 0.01 inch of rainfall. The gauge\r\nis connected electrically with registering apparatus indoors, so that\r\nevery tip of the bucket is recorded. The registration sheet shows the\r\ntime of occurrence as well as the amount of rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe two most important things about the wind that are observed and\r\nrecorded by meteorologists are its direction and its force. It is\r\nthe universal custom to regard as “the direction of the wind” the\r\ndirection _from_ which, rather than toward which, it blows. Moreover,\r\nit is only the horizontal direction of the wind that is ordinarily\r\nobserved, though many winds have a considerable upward or downward\r\nslant, and, locally, a wind may even blow straight up or straight\r\ndown. The direction of the wind may be observed in several makeshift\r\nways, such as by watching the drift of smoke from chimneys, or, as\r\nsailors do, holding up a wet finger to the breeze. Instrumentally and\r\nscientifically it is observed with a special type of _vane_, much more\r\naccurate in its indications than the weather vanes and weather cocks of\r\nornamental and symbolical architecture. The nonscientific vane, once\r\nset in motion, is likely to be carried too far by its own momentum,\r\nand may even spin completely around under a sudden impulse. In the\r\nscientific vane this tendency is restrained by means of a spread tail;\r\nthe pressure of the wind on the diverging blades serving to hold the\r\nvane in the correct position. The vane, like most other meteorological\r\ninstruments, is self-recording at all important meteorological\r\nstations. The type used by the Weather Bureau registers the direction\r\nof the wind every minute.\r\n\r\nThe force of the wind is obtained from an _anemometer_. Most\r\nanemometers do not, however, show this directly, but are designed to\r\nmeasure the speed or so-called “velocity” of the wind, from which its\r\nforce may be computed. The speed is observed in miles per hour or\r\nmeters per second. In considering some of the possible effects of wind\r\nit is well to bear in mind that its force increases as the square of\r\nthe velocity. This means, for example, that a wind of 20 miles an hour\r\nis four times as strong, and one of 30 miles an hour nine times as\r\nstrong as a wind of 10 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nOne of the external features of a weather station that invariably\r\nattracts the attention of the passer-by is an instrument consisting\r\nof four hemispherical cups revolving horizontally in the wind. This\r\nscientific whirligig is the _Robinson cup anemometer_, which, in spite\r\nof its shortcomings, is the most widely used instrument of its class\r\nthroughout the world. As generally constructed, the cups are supposed\r\nto turn 500 times for a mile of wind movement. Actually the relation\r\nbetween the speed of the cups and the speed of the wind is somewhat\r\nvariable, and at high velocities the indications of the instrument are\r\nseriously erroneous. The Robinson anemometer has a dial from which\r\ndirect readings can be made, but at large stations it is connected\r\nelectrically with a registering device in the observer’s office, which\r\nmakes a mark for each mile of wind and shows how the speed of the wind\r\nvaries through the day.\r\n\r\nThere are many other types of anemometer, and some of them tell a much\r\nmore detailed story of the wind’s variations than does the Robinson\r\ninstrument. On the other hand, thousands of weather observers\r\ndispense with anemometers altogether and merely estimate the strength\r\nof the wind from its effects. This applies to nearly all observers\r\nat sea, and, in Europe, to the vast majority of observers on land.\r\nSuch estimates are recorded on a scale ranging from zero, for a calm,\r\ngenerally up to ten or twelve for the strongest winds ever experienced.\r\nSeveral different scales are in use. The best known is the Beaufort\r\nScale, devised by Admiral Sir F. Beaufort, in 1805. The following\r\ntable of the Beaufort Scale, as adapted for use on land, is from the\r\n“Observer’s Handbook” of the British Meteorological Office:\r\n\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------------------------+-----------\r\n  Beaufort|  Explanatory  | Specification of Beaufort Scale | Equivalent\r\n   number |    titles     |    for use on land based on     | speed in\r\n          |               |    observations made at land    | miles per\r\n          |               |            stations             |  hour at\r\n          |               |                                 |  33 feet\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------------------------+-----------\r\n     0    | Calm          | Calm; smoke rises vertically    |        0\r\n     1    | Light air     | Direction of wind shown by      |\r\n          |               |   smoke drift, but not by wind  |\r\n          |               |   vanes                         |        2\r\n     2    | Slight breeze | Wind felt on face; leaves       |\r\n          |               |   rustle; ordinary vane moved   |\r\n          |               |   by wind                       |        5\r\n     3    | Gentle breeze | Leaves and small twigs in       |\r\n          |               |   constant motion wind extends  |\r\n          |               |   light flag                    |       10\r\n     4    | Moderate      | Raises dust and loose paper;    |\r\n          |   breeze      |   small branches are moved      |       15\r\n     5    | Fresh breeze  | Small trees in leaf begin to    |\r\n          |               |   sway; crested wavelets form   |\r\n          |               |   on inland waters              |       21\r\n     6    | Strong breeze | Large branches in motion;       |\r\n          |               |   whistling heard in telegraph  |\r\n          |               |   wires; umbrellas used with    |\r\n          |               |   difficulty                    |       27\r\n     7    | High wind     | Whole trees in motion;          |\r\n          |               |   inconvenience felt when       |\r\n          |               |   walking against wind          |       35\r\n     8    | Gale          | Breaks twigs off trees;         |\r\n          |               |   generally impedes progress    |       42\r\n     9    | Strong gale   | Slight structural damage occurs |\r\n          |               |   (chimney pots and slates      |\r\n          |               |   removed)                      |       50\r\n    10    | Whole gale    | Seldom experienced inland;      |\r\n          |               |   trees uprooted; considerable  |\r\n          |               |   structural damage occurs      |       59\r\n    11    | Storm         | Very rarely experienced;        |\r\n          |               |   accompanied by widespread     |\r\n          |               |   damage                        |       68\r\n    12    | Hurricane     |                                 | Above 75\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------------------------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe clouds receive more attention at some weather stations than at\r\nothers. A routine observation consists of noting the kinds of clouds\r\nvisible, the direction or directions from which they are moving,\r\nand the degree of cloudiness--i. e., the extent to which the sky is\r\nclouded, stated in tenths, from O = cloudless, to 10 = completely\r\novercast. At many of the more important stations the movements of\r\nclouds are observed with a _nephoscope_. The reflecting nephoscope,\r\nused in this country, consists of a black mirror in which the image of\r\nthe moving cloud is watched, the direction of its motion being read off\r\nfrom the graduated circular frame of the mirror. There is also a device\r\nfor measuring the apparent speed of the cloud. From this the actual\r\nspeed can be calculated if the height of the cloud is known. There are\r\nother nephoscopes, such as Besson’s in which the cloud’s movements are\r\nwatched directly, and not by reflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BESSON’S COMB NEPHOSCOPE]\r\n\r\nThe importance of sunshine among the elements of weather and climate\r\nis evidenced by the fact that at least two States of the Union,\r\nSouth Dakota and California, contend for the title of “the Sunshine\r\nState”--which does not properly belong to either of them. Arizona is\r\nthe sunniest State of all, and the whole Southwest is sunnier than\r\nSouth Dakota.\r\n\r\nDevices for registering the duration of sunshine are called _sunshine\r\nrecorders_. One type (the Campbell-Stokes) works on the burning-glass\r\nprinciple; in others the sun’s rays trace a record on photographic\r\npaper. The instrument used by the Weather Bureau consists of an air\r\nthermometer having a bulb at each end, one bulb being coated with\r\nlampblack. There is a small column of mercury between the two inclosed\r\nmasses of air. The thermometer is inclosed in a sheath of glass, from\r\nwhich the air is exhausted. When the sun shines on this instrument,\r\nthe air in the black bulb warms and expands, and the mercury is\r\nforced toward the other bulb until it comes in contact with a pair of\r\nelectrodes, thus closing an electrical circuit. While the circuit is\r\nclosed, the registering apparatus connected with the instrument makes\r\na step-shaped mark once every minute. When the sun stops shining, the\r\nmercury drops back, the circuit is broken, and the recording pen merely\r\ntraces a straight line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRICAL SUNSHINE RECORDER]\r\n\r\nAt the larger stations of the United States Weather Bureau the\r\ndirection and speed of the wind, the rainfall and the duration of\r\nsunshine are all recorded on a single sheet of paper, wound around a\r\nlarge cylinder, which is turned by clockwork. The paper is ruled with\r\nlines to denote the hours and minutes of the day, and a fresh sheet is\r\nput on the cylinder every day at noon. This complex registering device,\r\nsometimes called in book language a _meteorograph_, but colloquially\r\nreferred to by weather men as the “triple register,” is entitled to\r\nhigh rank among labor-saving machines; for, with hardly any attention,\r\nexcept for a few minutes at noon, it does the work of a staff of\r\ntrained meteorologists on duty day and night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH TYPE OF SUNSHINE RECORDER\r\n\r\n(_Campbell-Stokes Pattern_)]\r\n\r\nWe have now enumerated the elements of weather most commonly observed\r\nat meteorological stations, and the principal types of meteorological\r\ninstruments, with special reference to those used in the United States.\r\nIn nearly every civilized country there are certain stations at which\r\nregular observations are maintained of a number of phenomena not\r\nmentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, such as the intensity of solar\r\nradiation (measured with the _pyrheliometer_), evaporation (measured\r\nwith _atmometers_ or _evaporimeters_), and the temperature of the\r\nsoil; and the number of stations is rapidly growing at which the winds\r\nand weather far aloft in the atmosphere are observed by means of kites\r\nand balloons. Meteorologists of the Old World use a great many types\r\nof apparatus that are rarely seen in this country, and some of our\r\ninstruments are but little known abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCLOUDLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the things a tea kettle is good for is to provide, by means of\r\nthe little cloud seen at its nozzle and erroneously called “steam,” an\r\nexample of what happens when the invisible gas that is truly steam,\r\nor water vapor, is cooled below its dew point in the free air. This\r\ncloud has, however, been the starting point of a vast number of halfway\r\nexplanations. A generation or so ago physicists were content to say\r\nthat aqueous vapor turns to drops of water in the air merely on account\r\nof being cooled. The question of how the drops get their start, or why\r\nthe moisture forms drops at all, does not seem to have troubled them.\r\n\r\nOne way in which air or any other gas is cooled is by expanding against\r\npressure. Some of the energy in the gas, originally manifesting itself\r\nas heat, is applied to the work of expansion, and thus ceases to be\r\nheat. Hence the temperature of the gas falls. Conversely, if a mass\r\nof gas is compressed, the mere process of compression raises its\r\ntemperature. The heat produced in pumping up a bicycle tire is the\r\nclassic example of the latter fact. Heating by compression and cooling\r\nby expansion are called, respectively, “dynamic heating” and “dynamic\r\ncooling.” The processes thus described are of the utmost importance in\r\nmeteorology.\r\n\r\nIf air of average humidity is admitted to the receiver of an air pump\r\nin the usual way and suddenly expanded by partial exhaustion, a cloud\r\nof moisture is seen to form in the receiver. This moisture is condensed\r\nand made visible by the dynamic cooling of the air. If, however,\r\nafter the receiver is exhausted air of the same humidity as before is\r\nadmitted through a filter of cotton wool, and is then similarly cooled\r\nby expansion, no cloud will form. Evidently the filter has removed from\r\nthe air something that is essential to the process of condensation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will occur to the reader that, in some obscure way, the\r\nfilter has prevented water vapor itself from entering the receiver.\r\nThere are several methods by which we can ascertain whether such is the\r\ncase. One of the simplest is to admit a little smoke to the receiver\r\nbefore expanding the filtered air. In this case the cloud _does_ form,\r\nshowing that moisture is present, and also showing that smoke, though a\r\nperfectly dry substance, aids the formation of the water drops.\r\n\r\nSuch experiments have led to the conclusion, now universally admitted,\r\nthat when water drops form in the atmosphere they always form around\r\n“nuclei” of something that is not water. These nuclei are often\r\nreferred to as “dust particles,” but it is recognized that a vast\r\nproportion of them are very much more minute than the dust that worries\r\nhousewives. They are largely beyond the power of the microscope, and\r\nsome of them, indeed, appear to be of molecular size, consisting of\r\nmolecules of hygroscopic gases, such as the oxides of sulphur and of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nAnother important fact about water drops in the atmosphere has come\r\nto light within the last half century. Since water is much heavier\r\nthan air, meteorologists of an earlier generation were puzzled by the\r\nfact that the drops in clouds apparently float, instead of falling\r\nto the ground. In the attempt to account for this supposed floating,\r\nbygone authorities assumed that the drops were hollow “vesicles,” like\r\nlittle bubbles. This assumption was eventually disproved by the optical\r\nphenomena exhibited by the drops, as well as on other physical grounds.\r\nMoreover, it is now known that a cloud never really floats, though the\r\nrate at which its constituent particles fall with respect to the air is\r\ngenerally very small, on account of the resistance they encounter. Thus\r\na very slight upward current usually suffices to maintain the altitude\r\nof a cloud, or even to increase it. The speed with which a drop falls\r\nincreases with its size. Hence large drops may fall rapidly from great\r\nheights all the way to the ground, constituting rain; but in a great\r\nmany cases such drops evaporate on falling into warmer air below the\r\ncloud level, and thus the lower surface of the visible cloud remains at\r\nabout a constant height.\r\n\r\nThe drops in clouds and fog have often been measured, either by noting\r\ntheir optical effects or by microscopic examination. Many are found to\r\nbe from 0.0006 to 0.0008 inch in diameter. The speed with which such\r\ndrops fall through still air can be calculated. A drop 0.0008 inch\r\nin diameter falls at the rate of about half an inch a second, or 150\r\nfeet an hour. Even if a cloud consisting of such drops preserved its\r\nintegrity for an hour or more while sinking, its descent at this slow\r\nrate would hardly be perceptible from the ground.\r\n\r\nSome clouds consist of ice needles or tiny snowflakes. Apparently these\r\nicy particles are produced directly in solid form, without passing\r\nthrough the liquid stage. It is supposed that, like drops, they\r\nrequire nuclei on which to condense, but this matter has not been fully\r\ninvestigated. Another point that awaits elucidation is the fact that\r\nthe clouds that form in air much below the freezing point sometimes\r\nconsist of water and sometimes of ice. The common fleecy clouds of our\r\nwinter skies are composed of water drops, and such clouds also occur\r\nin the polar regions. Dr. G. C. Simpson, when serving as meteorologist\r\nof Scott’s antarctic expedition, observed fog consisting of liquid\r\nwater at a temperature of 29° below zero, Fahrenheit. Why such greatly\r\n“undercooled” drops should sometimes occur in the atmosphere when at\r\nother times, with higher temperatures, atmospheric moisture takes the\r\nform of ice is not at all clear.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which the free air may be cooled to the\r\npoint at which condensation occurs. The commonest is dynamic cooling,\r\ndue to the rise of a mass of moist air and its expansion under the\r\nreduced pressure that prevails at the higher levels. This process is\r\nbeautifully illustrated in the formation of the roundish masses of\r\nfleecy cloud known as _cumulus_, on a warm summer day. Each of these\r\nclouds marks the summit of a column of air that is rising after having\r\nbeen heated at the surface of the earth. When the process goes on\r\nvery actively, the cloud may tower up to enormous heights, forming a\r\nthundercloud. Some clouds are formed by the mixing of air of different\r\ntemperatures. Fog, which is merely cloud at the surface of the earth,\r\nis often formed by the cooling of the air in contact with cold land or\r\nwater. The persistent fogs of the Newfoundland Banks are due to the\r\npassage of warm moist air from the Gulf Stream region over the cold\r\nLabrador Current. On the other hand, a cold wind blowing over warm\r\nwater will also often produce a fog by lowering the temperature of\r\nthe moist air overlying the water. A common cause of land fog is the\r\ncooling of the air adjacent to the ground in consequence of nocturnal\r\nradiation. The moister the air, the more readily fog forms, and hence\r\nthe frequent formation of fog by night along rivers and over marshes\r\nand damp valleys.\r\n\r\nTown fogs, such as the famous “London particular” and the fogs of\r\nLyons, usually consist partly of smoke. Dense fogs of this sort occur\r\nwhen the conditions of the atmosphere are such as to cause the smoke\r\nto hang low over the city, instead of being dispersed. These fogs\r\nconstitute a serious economic problem. Thus it is estimated that they\r\ncost the people of London upwards of half a million dollars a year, due\r\nto extra lighting, damage to vehicles, loss of business, etc. Since\r\nmarine fog is also a source of enormous loss, through causing delays\r\nand accidents, and since fog along air routes is the greatest of all\r\nobstacles to successful aerial navigation, it is no wonder that much\r\ningenuity has been devoted to the attempt to disperse fog artificially.\r\nElectric discharges have been successfully used for this purpose on a\r\nsmall scale.\r\n\r\nThe depth of a fog may be anything from inches to miles. Measurements\r\nmade by the United States Coast Guard during the international ice\r\npatrol of the North Atlantic show that the fogs on the Newfoundland\r\nBanks are very commonly so shallow that the mastheads of vessels rise\r\nabove them, though in some cases they were found, from observations\r\nwith kites, to be from 2,500 to 3,000 feet thick. Observations on the\r\nmountains of the California coast show that the upper level of fog\r\nin that region rarely exceeds 4,000 feet. On the other hand, aviators\r\nflying between London and Paris have encountered fog more than 10,000\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nThe United States Weather Bureau classifies a fog as “dense” if it\r\nhides objects at a distance of 1,000 feet; otherwise it is described as\r\n“light.” British meteorologists record fogs on a scale of five degrees.\r\n\r\nDuring the ice patrol of the _Seneca_ in 1915 samples of foggy air were\r\nexamined for the purpose of calculating the amount of water and the\r\nnumber of drops they contained per unit volume, as well as the size\r\nof the drops. A block of dense fog 3 feet wide, 6 feet high, and 100\r\nfeet long was found to contain less than one-seventh of a glassful of\r\nwater, distributed in 60,000,000,000 drops. During the densest fog of\r\nthe voyage the diameter of the fog particles averaged 0.0004 inch; just\r\nabout the limit of visibility with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the extremely attenuated state of the water in fogs, as\r\nindicated by these figures, the moisture they deposit on terrestrial\r\nobjects is great enough to be of considerable agricultural importance\r\nin some parts of the world. Thus along the coast of Peru, where the\r\nrainfall is negligible (though not, as often stated, nonexistent),\r\na wet fog known as the “garúa” suffices to maintain a luxuriant\r\nvegetation during several months of each year.\r\n\r\nThere are frozen fogs as well as frozen clouds. The “frost smoke”\r\nthat rises over the Norwegian fjords and over ice-free spots in the\r\npolar seas is generally composed of icy particles or snowflakes. An\r\nice fog that sometimes forms in mountain valleys in the western United\r\nStates is known as the “pogonip”--a name derived from the Shoshonean\r\nlanguage. This fog often appears very suddenly, even in the brightest\r\nweather. The minute needles of ice of which it consists are said to be\r\nextremely injurious to the lungs. There are tales of a whole tribe of\r\nIndians perishing from its effects. Whatever truth there may be in such\r\nstories, it is greatly dreaded by both the Indians and the whites. The\r\nmountains of Nevada appear to be the favorite home of the pogonip.\r\n\r\nWhat meteorologists call “dry fog” is a haze of dust or smoke,\r\nsometimes very dense. We have already described the prevalence of\r\nthis turbid state of the atmosphere following volcanic eruptions, the\r\nburning of forests and moors, and desert dust storms. Under the head\r\nof dry fog many writers include a sort of heat haze, which does not\r\nnecessarily involve the suspension of either solid or liquid matter in\r\nthe air, but is due to the mixing of local air currents of different\r\ndensities, especially when evaporation is proceeding rapidly from moist\r\nground under strong sunshine. The _callina_ of Spain and the _qobar_ of\r\nthe upper Nile region are probably due partly to this cause, and partly\r\nto dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTO-CUMULUS CLOUDS. These clouds always occur in\r\nroundish fleecy masses or in elongated fleecy rolls, with blue sky\r\nbetween. A score of different types have been distinguished and named\r\nby certain cloud specialists. (_Photographed by A. J. Weed._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUMULUS. Cloud photography has become a special branch\r\nof photographic art, entailing not only the use of appropriate lenses\r\nand plates, but also of ray filters, or other special devices for\r\nsharpening the contrast between the cloud and the blue sky. Mr.\r\nEllerman’s pictures, made on Mt. Wilson and elsewhere in California,\r\nstand in the front rank. (_Photographed by F. Ellerman._)]\r\n\r\nOne more species of fog requires mention here, viz., the dirty,\r\nfoul-smelling “painter” of the Peruvian coast, which deposits on\r\nvessels lying in the harbor of Callao and elsewhere a slimy brown\r\nsubstance known as “Peruvian paint.” This substance comes from the\r\nocean and is probably due to the decomposition of marine organisms. The\r\n“painter” prevails during the months December to April. According to a\r\nplausible hypothesis a change in the temperature of the water at that\r\nseason, resulting from a periodical shift of ocean currents, kills\r\nvast quantities of plankton, the decay of which would give rise to the\r\nphenomena observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAMMATO-CUMULUS. A rather rare cloud form, associated\r\nwith thunderstorms and tornadoes. It is known in Scotland as the\r\n“pocky” (i. e. baggy) cloud and in parts of England as “rain balls.”\r\n(_Photographed by L. C. Twyford._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUMULO-NIMBUS. This is the thundercloud. (_Courtesy of\r\nthe Naval Air Service._)]\r\n\r\nClouds, though they are nothing more than masses of fog situated at\r\nsome distance from the earth, are susceptible of a classification,\r\naccording to shape and texture, that is not applicable to fog. Among\r\nthe billions of human beings who, in all ages, have amused themselves\r\nby discovering pictures in the clouds it would be remarkable if a\r\ngood many had not, from time to time, conceived the idea of reducing\r\nthese pictures to a few general types. According to a note published a\r\nfew years ago in the “Quarterly Journal” of the Royal Meteorological\r\nSociety, there is some reason to believe that an elaborate\r\nclassification of the clouds was in use among the ancient Hindus. A\r\npassage quoted from an Indian work of the fourth century B. C. says:\r\n\r\n“Three are the clouds that continuously rain for seven days; eighty are\r\nthey that pour minute drops; and sixty are they that appear with the\r\nsunshine.”\r\n\r\nIn the occidental world, however, we have no record of any attempt\r\nto classify the clouds prior to the year 1801, when the following\r\nclassification was proposed by the French naturalist Lamarck:\r\n\r\n  Nuages en balayures (cloud sweepings),\r\n  Nuages en barres (clouds in bars),\r\n  Nuages pommelés (dappled clouds),\r\n  Nuages groupés (grouped or piled clouds),\r\n  Nuages en voile (veil clouds),\r\n  Nuages attroupés ou moutonnés (clouds in flocks).\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the English meteorologist Luke Howard published the system of\r\nclassification that, with some additions and modifications, is now\r\nin general use. This system is based upon three fundamental forms;\r\nviz., fibrous or feathery clouds (_cirrus_), clouds with rounded\r\ntops (_cumulus_), and clouds arranged in horizontal sheets or layers\r\n(_stratus_). Intermediate forms are described by compounding the\r\nnames of the primary types; e. g., _cirro-cumulus_, _cirro-stratus_,\r\netc. The rain cloud is called _nimbus_. Howard’s classification was\r\nquickly adopted in all countries. His definitions were translated into\r\nGerman by no less a personage than Goethe, who, in his enthusiasm over\r\nHoward’s achievement, wrote a poem about it, and also a separate poem\r\nabout each of the principal types of cloud!\r\n\r\nThe Latin names that Howard gave to the clouds made his system\r\nimmediately available for international use; and in nearly all of the\r\nmany systems of cloud nomenclature that have since been proposed the\r\nexcellent plan of using Latin names has been preserved. Very soon,\r\nhowever, after Howard’s classification appeared, a list of proposed\r\nEnglish equivalents of his names was published in the “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica”--which, nevertheless, did not change its name to “British\r\nEncyclopædia”--for the benefit of the unlettered majority, supposed\r\nto be incapable of using a few Latin terms that were, in fact,\r\nshorter and no more difficult to pronounce than their suggested\r\nEnglish substitutes! A piquant sequel to this episode is that these\r\nsuperfluous English cloud names, “curl cloud,” “stackencloud,” “fall\r\ncloud,” “sondercloud,” “wane cloud,” and “twain cloud,” still survive\r\nin the dictionaries--and nowhere else. They are practically unknown to\r\nmeteorologists, and were never adopted generally by the laity.\r\n\r\nOf course some English names, which have been evolved and not\r\ndeliberately invented, are applied to certain types of cloud in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries; but the Latin names, comprised in the\r\nInternational Cloud Classification, should be learned by everybody.\r\nThis classification, which has been adopted by the International\r\nMeteorological Committee and is used by all official weather services,\r\nis a little more detailed than Howard’s, upon which it is based; and\r\nthere is a tendency to add new terms to it from time to time.\r\n\r\nThere are ten principal types of cloud in the International\r\nClassification, and the name of each type has an official abbreviation\r\n(a great convenience for those who record the clouds from day to\r\nday). The following definitions, translated from the French text of\r\nthe “International Cloud Atlas,” have been published by the British\r\nMeteorological Office:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CIRRUS (CI.)--_Detached clouds of delicate appearance, fibrous\r\n(threadlike) structure and featherlike form, generally white in color._\r\n\r\nCirrus clouds take the most varied shapes, such as isolated tufts\r\nof hair--i. e., thin filaments on a blue sky--branched filaments in\r\nfeathery form, straight or curved filaments ending in tufts (called\r\n_cirrus uncinus_), and others. Occasionally cirrus clouds are arranged\r\nin bands, which traverse part of the sky as arcs of great circles,\r\nand as an effect of perspective appear to converge at a point on the\r\nhorizon, and at the opposite point also, if they are sufficiently\r\nextended. Cirro-stratus and cirro-cumulus also are sometimes similarly\r\narranged in long bands. [Certain forms of cirrus are called “mares’\r\ntails.” The long bands crossing the sky, as just described, are known\r\nas “polar bands” or “Noah’s ark.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CIRRO-STRATUS (CI.-ST.)--_A thin sheet of whitish cloud; sometimes\r\ncovering the sky completely and merely giving it a milky appearance;\r\nit is then called cirro-nebula, or cirrus haze; at other times\r\npresenting more or less distinctly a fibrous structure, like a tangled\r\nweb._\r\n\r\nThis sheet often produces halos around the sun or moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CIRRO-CUMULUS (CI-CU.) (_Mackerel sky_)--_Small rounded masses or\r\nwhite flakes without shadows, or showing very slight shadow; arranged\r\nin groups and often in lines._\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ALTO-STRATUS (A.-ST.)--_A dense sheet of a gray or bluish color,\r\nsometimes forming a compact mass of dull gray color and fibrous\r\nstructure._\r\n\r\nAt other times the sheet is thin, like the denser forms of\r\ncirro-stratus, and through it the sun and moon may be seen dimly\r\ngleaming as through ground glass. This form exhibits all stages of\r\ntransition between alto-stratus and cirro-stratus, but, according\r\nto measurements, its normal altitude is about one-half that of\r\ncirro-stratus.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ALTO-CUMULUS (A.-CU.)--_Larger rounded masses, white or grayish,\r\npartially shaded, arranged in groups or lines, and often so crowded\r\ntogether in the middle region that the cloudlets join._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLOUD BANNER OVER MT. ASSINIBOINE, CANADIAN ROCKIES.\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. C. D. Walcott._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRRUS (with a few patches of lower clouds in the\r\nforeground). This is cirrus, but not of the “mare’s tail” variety.\r\nThere are many distinct types of cirrus, which have sometimes been\r\ngiven separate names. (_Photographed at the Observatory of Trappes,\r\nFrance._)]\r\n\r\nThe separate masses are generally larger and more compact (resembling\r\nstrato-cumulus) in the middle region of the group, but the denseness\r\nof the layer varies and sometimes is so attenuated that the individual\r\nmasses assume the appearance of sheets or thin flakes of considerable\r\nextent with hardly any shading. At the margin of the group they form\r\nsmaller cloudlets resembling those of cirro-cumulus. The cloudlets\r\noften group themselves in parallel lines, arranged in one or more\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. STRATO-CUMULUS (ST.-CU.)--_Large lumpy masses or rolls of dull gray\r\ncloud, frequently covering the whole sky, especially in winter._\r\n\r\nGenerally strato-cumulus presents the appearance of a gray layer broken\r\nup into irregular masses and having on the margin smaller masses\r\ngrouped in flocks, like alto-cumulus. Sometimes this cloud form has the\r\ncharacteristic appearance of great rolls of cloud arranged in parallel\r\nlines close together (“roll cumulus”). The rolls themselves are dense\r\nand dark, but in the intervening spaces the cloud is much lighter and\r\nblue sky may sometimes be seen through them. Strato-cumulus may be\r\ndistinguished from nimbus by its lumpy or rolling appearance, and by\r\nthe fact that it does not tend to bring rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright O. P. Anderson\r\n\r\nA LENTICULAR CLOUD OVER MT. RAINIER]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. NIMBUS (NB.)--_A dense layer of dark, shapeless cloud with ragged\r\nedges from which steady rain or snow usually falls. If there are\r\nopenings in the cloud an upper layer of cirro-stratus may almost\r\ninvariably be seen through them._\r\n\r\nIf a layer of nimbus separates in strong wind into ragged cloud, or\r\nif small detached clouds are seen drifting underneath a large nimbus\r\n(the “scud” of sailors), either may be specified as _fracto-nimbus_\r\n(FR.-NB.).\r\n\r\n\r\n8. CUMULUS (CU.) (_Wool-pack cloud_)--_Thick cloud of which the upper\r\nsurface is dome-shaped and exhibits protuberances, while the base is\r\ngenerally horizontal._\r\n\r\nThese clouds appear to be formed by ascensional movement of air in the\r\ndaytime, which is almost always observable. When the cloud and the\r\nsun are on opposite sides of the observer, the surfaces facing the\r\nobserver are more brilliant than the margins of the protuberances.\r\nWhen, on the contrary, it is on the same side of the observer as the\r\nsun, it appears dark with bright edges. When the light falls sideways,\r\nas is usually the case, cumulus clouds show deep shadows. True cumulus\r\nhas well-defined upper and lower margins; but one may sometimes see\r\nragged clouds, like cumulus torn by strong wind, of which the detached\r\nportions are continually changing; to this form of cloud the name\r\nfracto-cumulus may be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. CUMULO-NIMBUS (CU.-NB.)(_The thundercloud_)--_Great masses of cloud\r\nrising in the form of mountains or towers or anvils, generally having a\r\nveil or screen of fibrous texture (“false cirrus”) at the top, and at\r\nits base a cloud mass similar to nimbus._\r\n\r\nFrom the base local showers of rain or snow, occasionally of hail or\r\ngraupel, usually fall. Sometimes the upper margins have the compact\r\nshape of cumulus, or form massive heaps round which floats delicate\r\n“false cirrus.” At other times the margins themselves are fringed with\r\nfilaments similar to cirrus clouds. This last form is particularly\r\ncommon with spring showers. The front of a thunderstorm of wide extent\r\nis frequently in the form of a large low arch above a region of\r\nuniformly lighter sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. STRATUS (ST.)--_A uniform layer of cloud, like fog, but not lying\r\non the ground._\r\n\r\nThe cloud layer of stratus is always very low. If it is divided\r\ninto ragged masses in a wind or by mountain tops, it may be called\r\n_fracto-stratus_. The complete absence of detail of structure\r\ndifferentiates stratus from other aggregated forms of cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have given the foregoing official definitions and descriptions\r\nin full in order to aid the reader as much as possible, so far as\r\nverbal information goes, in learning to call the common clouds by\r\ntheir names. Good pictures are, of course, an essential part of this\r\nprocess, and apart from those that illustrate the present text, many\r\ncollections of such pictures are easy of access. Some may be obtained\r\nfree or at nominal cost from the Weather Bureau in Washington and from\r\nthe Meteorological Office in London. The “International Cloud Atlas”\r\n(second edition, Paris, 1910) is now out of print, but may be consulted\r\nin libraries.\r\n\r\nOf the clouds above enumerated, cirrus, cirro-cumulus, and\r\ncirro-stratus are the highest, and are always ice clouds. They\r\nconsist in some cases of separate, minute crystals--a fine dust of\r\nice--producing, according to the forms of the crystals, one or another\r\nof the various forms of halo around the sun and moon; while in other\r\ncases the crystals are aggregated in small snowflakes, so that the\r\ncloud is a real snowstorm in midair. The altitude of these clouds\r\ngenerally ranges from 4 to 8 miles. In the equatorial region their\r\nheight is often 10 miles or more. The other main types of cloud are\r\ncomposed wholly or chiefly of water. Alto-cumulus and alto-stratus are\r\nclouds of medium altitude; strato-cumulus and nimbus are low clouds\r\n(generally not more than a mile high); while stratus, the lowest cloud\r\nof all, grades into fog, which commonly rests on the earth. Since\r\ncumulus and cumulo-nimbus are produced by the condensation of moisture\r\nfrom rising air currents, the height of their bases varies widely\r\nwith the temperature and humidity of the lower air; the average height\r\nis rather less than a mile. Their vertical extent, however, is much\r\ngreater than that of the other cloud types. Cumulo-nimbus sometimes\r\ntowers to a height of 4 or 5 miles above its base, and it is then\r\ncommonly crowned with ice clouds, including a filmy “scarf cloud”\r\ndraping the summit, and spreading wisps of so-called “false cirrus,”\r\ndrawn out horizontally by the upper winds.\r\n\r\nBesides the ten main classes of clouds, a few distinct minor varieties\r\nare recognized by all meteorologists. Among these is the “lenticular\r\ncloud”; an isolated small cloud, which frequently shows iridescence,\r\nand the shape of which has been compared to that of a lens or an\r\nalmond. This cloud may remain stationary, or nearly so, but it really\r\nmarks the position of a billow in a stream of air, the moisture\r\ncondensing at one edge of the cloud and dissolving at the other.\r\nAnother distinctive and rather rare form of cloud, seen chiefly in\r\nconnection with thunderstorms, is _mammato-cumulus_, likewise known\r\nas “pocky cloud,” “festoon cloud,” “rain balls,” etc. It consists of\r\nnumerous sacklike or udderlike protuberances, convex downward.\r\n\r\nWhen a stream of moist air is forced to ascend in passing over a\r\nmountain its moisture is often condensed by the process of dynamic\r\ncooling, already explained, and a “cloud cap” is seen over the summit.\r\nIn local weather lore such caps are generally regarded as a sign\r\nof rain. These clouds attached to mountains were called “parasitic\r\nclouds,” by writers of a century ago, who proposed some naïve\r\nexplanations of them. Occasionally a “cloud banner” streams far to the\r\nleeward of the mountain. One of the most famous and striking of cloud\r\ncaps is the “tablecloth” that spreads over Table Mountain, near Cape\r\nTown, when a moist wind blows in from the sea. Sometimes the local\r\ntopography causes the wind that has swept up over a mountain to form a\r\nsecond “standing” wave to the leeward of the summit, and this may also\r\nbe marked by a cloud, which, like the cloud cap, presents a delusive\r\nappearance of permanence, while it is, in reality, in constant process\r\nof formation on the windward side and dissipation on the leeward.\r\nThe two clouds thus formed, one over the summit and the other to the\r\nleeward, are often seen at Table Mountain, and are further exemplified\r\nin the celebrated “helm and bar” of Crossfell, in the English Lake\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a wind blowing athwart a ridge or mountain range, a bank\r\nof cloud may extend along the whole crest, as in the “foehn wall” that\r\nappears along Alpine heights when the foehn wind is blowing.\r\n\r\nSome day meteorology will be taught in art schools, for the same reason\r\nthat anatomy now is. When that blissful day arrives painters will\r\nprobably show us skies less at odds with nature than those that deface\r\nthe work of artists of all degrees of celebrity, including the “old\r\nmasters.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPRECIPITATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorologists have been in much perplexity over the naming and\r\nclassification of the various deposits of atmospheric moisture known\r\ncollectively as “precipitation.” The subject is one to which a good\r\ndeal of attention has been paid in recent years, but it must be\r\nadmitted that, even at the present time, the terminology of this group\r\nof atmospheric phenomena is not yet satisfactorily settled, either in\r\nEnglish or in any other language.\r\n\r\nWhen, for example, a record of weather occurrences states that hail\r\nhas fallen, this statement, unequivocal as it may seem to the layman,\r\noften raises a question in the mind of the meteorologist. For centuries\r\npeople talked and wrote about hail before it occurred to men of science\r\nto inquire whether one and the same thing was always described under\r\nthis name. The pursuit of this inquiry led to disconcerting results,\r\none of them being the discovery that we do not now know, in many cases,\r\nwhat bygone weather observers meant when they made the entry “hail” in\r\ntheir records.\r\n\r\nThere are at least three different kinds of icy lumps and pellets that\r\nfall from the sky, and they have all been called hail. What science now\r\nregards as true hail occurs only in connection with thunderstorms, and\r\ntherefore chiefly in warm weather. It consists of balls or irregular\r\nlumps, each of which, on examination, is found to have an opaque\r\nsnowlike center, surrounded by ice, which is often in alternately clear\r\nand opaque layers. The second class of icy particles takes the form of\r\nminiature snowballs, about the size of large shot or small peas. It\r\nfalls in cold weather, often in conjunction with ordinary snow. Because\r\nit readily crumbles, English-speaking meteorologists have called it\r\n“soft hail”; but this name is inappropriate for the two cogent reasons\r\nthat, though friable, it is not soft, and that it is not hail; hence\r\nthis term is now giving way to the German name “graupel” (in which _au_\r\n= _ow_ in “growl”). Lastly, little pellets or angular particles of\r\nclear ice sometimes fall in cold weather. These frozen drops, though\r\nfairly common, have, until recently, enjoyed the distinction of being\r\nanonymous, so far as the scientific world was concerned, while the\r\ngeneral public called them various things, including “hail.” A few\r\nBritish authorities have tentatively styled this form of precipitation\r\n“ice rain,” a name which has, however, been otherwise applied. Finally,\r\nin the year 1916, the United States Weather Bureau took the bull by the\r\nhorns and decreed that such ice particles should be called “sleet.”\r\n\r\nAlthough this decision of the Weather Bureau was arrived at only after\r\nan exhaustive overhauling of literature and much correspondence with\r\nphilologists, scientific men, engineers, and others, it remains to be\r\nseen whether it will eventually prevail throughout the English-speaking\r\nworld. In England “sleet” nearly always means a mixture of snow and\r\nrain. On the other hand, a great many Americans have been in the habit\r\nof applying this term to the coating of smooth ice, due to rain in\r\ncold weather, which often breaks down the branches of trees, lays low\r\nmiles of wires, and incidentally produces one of the most beautiful\r\nspectacles of American winters.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to another difficulty. The icy coating just mentioned\r\nhas, for some years, been called “glazed frost” by the British\r\nMeteorological Office, and the United States Weather Bureau now calls\r\nit “glaze.” It has likewise been called, even in scientific books,\r\n“silver thaw”; and an instance of its occurrence on a large scale is\r\ntermed, both popularly and scientifically, an “ice storm.”\r\n\r\nTo pursue this lamentable record of cross-purposes just a little\r\nfurther, it may be added that the expression “silver thaw,” besides\r\nbeing one of the aliases of glaze, or glazed frost, has been applied\r\nin various official British publications, until recently, to a very\r\ndifferent rough or feathery deposit of ice from fog, now called by both\r\nthe Meteorological Office and the Weather Bureau “rime.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, when the scientific authorities are unable to agree\r\nabout these terms, our dictionaries are sadly at sea in regard to them;\r\nso, altogether, the task of writing a chapter on precipitation is beset\r\nwith verbal difficulties that would not be encountered in writing on\r\nmany far more recondite subjects.\r\n\r\nFortunately the name of the most important kind of\r\nprecipitation--rain--is reasonably free from ambiguity. To be sure,\r\nopinions may differ as to whether a “Scotch mist” is a rain or a wet\r\nfog--and if one happened to have insured a lawn fête against rain at\r\nLloyds’ the uncertainty on this point might lead to litigation--but,\r\ngenerally speaking, “it rains or it does not rain,” as we are told in\r\nthe books on logic.\r\n\r\n“Rain,” says Dr. Hellmann, “is the most widespread, most frequent,\r\nand most copious form in which the aqueous vapor of the atmosphere\r\ncondenses. The area of its distribution embraces the whole surface\r\nof the earth, with the exception of the interior of Antarctica\r\nand probably of northern Greenland. The English and the Norwegian\r\nexpeditions found no rain even at the edge of Antarctica. As the land\r\nrises inland to an altitude of about 2,800 meters about the South\r\nPole, it may safely be assumed that only snow and no rain falls in the\r\nheart of Antarctica. At the North Pole, which lies in the midst of the\r\nsea, it probably rains at times; while on the high plateau of northern\r\nGreenland probably snow alone falls. As to its frequency, there are\r\narid regions in which the average annual number of days with rain is\r\nless than one, while this number probably rises to 280 in some tropical\r\ndistricts. With the exceptions of the polar regions already mentioned,\r\nthere are probably no regions where it never rains.”\r\n\r\nIn its intensity rain varies all the way from the finest drizzle or the\r\nsprinkle of occasional drops up to the torrential downpours often known\r\nas “cloud-bursts.” Before citing instances of heavy rains, it may be\r\nwell to remind the reader that an inch of rainfall is equivalent to 101\r\ntons of water per acre, or 64,640 tons per square mile. In the county\r\nof Norfolk, England, in August, 1912, a single day’s rainfall brought\r\ndown 670,720,000 tons of water--more than twice the volume of water\r\ncontained in England’s largest lake, Windermere. Doubtless this record,\r\nfor showers of similar extent and duration, has often been surpassed\r\nin other countries, including our own, and _a fortiori_ within the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable example of a heavy brief shower was recorded at\r\nPorto Bello, on the Isthmus of Panama, May 1, 1908, when a fall of\r\n2.47 inches _in three minutes_ was registered by a self-recording rain\r\ngauge. An average heavy rainstorm in the eastern United States yields\r\nabout this amount in twenty-four hours. At Baguio, in the Philippines,\r\nforty-six inches of rain fell from noon of July 14, 1911, to noon of\r\nthe following day--probably a “world record” for twenty-four-hour\r\nrainfall. The corresponding record for the United States is 22.22\r\ninches at Altapass, N. C., July 15-16, 1916.\r\n\r\nStatistics of what the meteorologist calls “excessive rainfall”--i.\r\ne., abnormally heavy rain during brief periods--have been collected\r\nover the greater part of the world for much more weighty reasons than\r\nto satisfy curiosity as to which showers were “record breakers.” Such\r\ndata are indispensable to engineers in connection with the building of\r\nsewers, reservoirs, and dams, and in flood-protection work. Sewers must\r\nbe made large enough to carry off the “storm water” from the heaviest\r\nshowers that ever occur in the locality; while, on the other hand,\r\nin the absence of rainfall statistics, much money might be wasted in\r\nmaking them larger than necessary. A great flood raises questions as\r\nto the intensity of the rainfall that caused it, and the frequency\r\nwith which similar rains may be expected to occur in the drainage area\r\nconcerned. The unprecedented floods in the Ohio Valley and adjacent\r\nregions in March, 1913, which caused losses amounting to $200,000,000,\r\nled to an exhaustive study of the records of storm rainfall in the\r\neastern United States, carried out by the engineers of the Miami\r\nConservancy District. Their report on this subject (published at\r\nDayton, Ohio, in 1917) is probably the most elaborate discussion of the\r\nkind hitherto prepared for any part of the world. Of the 2,641 storms\r\ninvestigated, seventy-eight, which covered areas of 500 square miles or\r\nmore, were found to have had a rainfall amounting to at least 20 per\r\ncent of the normal rainfall for a year.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of rainfall over the earth (using the word “rainfall”\r\nin the broad sense to include snow reduced to its water equivalent)\r\nis most conveniently described in terms of mean annual values. This\r\nelement is very unevenly divided between different parts of the globe\r\nand between the different regions of every large country. The raininess\r\nor dryness of a climate is determined especially by the prevailing\r\nmovement of moisture-bearing winds and the relief of the land, while a\r\nsecond important control is the location of a region with respect to\r\nstorm tracks. The rainiest regions are found on the windward slopes of\r\nmountain ranges not far from the ocean, where the moist winds, forced\r\nby the mountains to ascend rapidly, cool dynamically and shed their\r\nmoisture. Thus the southern slopes of the eastern Himalaya receive an\r\nenormous rainfall from the southwest monsoon, blowing from the Indian\r\nOcean, and an abundant rainfall also prevails on the south slopes of\r\nthe high mountains of eastern Tibet, while northern Tibet, in the lee\r\nof the mountains, is a desert.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century the little hill station of Cherrapunji,\r\nin Assam, at an altitude of 4,100 feet, has been credited with having\r\nthe heaviest rainfall in the world. According to the latest official\r\nrecord, its average annual precipitation is 426 inches. Recently it\r\nhas come to light that Cherrapunji has a serious rival in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands. A fragmentary record totaling 90 months, between 1911 and\r\n1921, kept on Mount Waialeale (altitude 5,075 feet), in the island of\r\nKauai, showed an average of 455 inches per annum, and there is reason\r\nto believe that a longer record will give an even higher average\r\nfor this place. The spot in question, which has been described as\r\n“Uncle Sam’s dampest corner,” is so difficult of access that it can\r\nbe reached only after a three-day trip on foot over mountain trails.\r\nHence the United States Geological Survey has installed here a huge\r\nrain gauge--said to be the largest in the world--capable of holding an\r\nentire year’s rainfall, so that measurements need be made only once a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest average annual rainfall in the United States (not\r\nincluding Alaska) is about 130 inches in Tillamook County, Ore. Over\r\nmost of our Atlantic seaboard States the rainfall ranges from forty\r\nto fifty inches. Extensive tracts in southern California and western\r\nNevada have a rainfall of five inches or less. Any region with an\r\nannual rainfall of less than ten inches is normally a desert, though\r\nirrigation or “dry farming” methods may enable its inhabitants to\r\npractice agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe process of rain formation is not well understood. As we have seen,\r\nthe existence of nuclei in the air serves to explain why, when the\r\nconditions of temperature and humidity are right, moisture condenses in\r\nthe tiny droplets that constitute clouds. The difficulty is to explain\r\nhow, at certain times, quantities of drops are formed of a size large\r\nenough to carry them rapidly to the earth. The number of nuclei is so\r\ngreat that, as Humphreys has pointed out, even if all the water vapor\r\nin a volume of humid air was condensed upon them, the size of each drop\r\nwould remain very small. He has suggested that, in a column of rising\r\nair, the small drops formed at the base of a cloud filter out most of\r\nthe nuclei, so that at greater heights there are relatively few of the\r\nlatter, which can, therefore, gather sufficient water about them to\r\nform drops of “falling” size.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which drops fall through the air, which is only a\r\nfraction of an inch per second for the average cloud droplet, increases\r\nrapidly with the size of the drop up to a certain point, but for the\r\ndrops that reach the earth as rain the speed of fall tends to become\r\napproximately uniform. Several investigators have measured the size\r\nof raindrops. One method of doing this is to allow the drops to fall\r\ninto a shallow layer of fine, uncompacted flour. Each drop forms a\r\nlittle pellet of dough, which is found, by experiments with previously\r\nmeasured drops (produced for the purpose and dropped from various\r\nheights), to correspond very closely with the size of the drop.\r\nThese pellets dry and harden, and can then be carefully measured,\r\nphotographed, etc. Hundreds of samples of raindrops were thus measured\r\nby Mr. W. A. Bentley of Jericho, Vt., and the measurements were\r\ntabulated with reference to the kinds of clouds from which they fell,\r\nthe distribution of large and small drops in the different parts of\r\na storm, and other circumstances attending their fall. Drops of very\r\ndifferent dimensions are found to fall at one time. The commonest sizes\r\nrecorded by Bentley were from one-thirtieth to one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter; but many drops too minute to form casts were estimated to be\r\nless than a hundredth of an inch in diameter, while the largest drops\r\nobserved had a diameter of a quarter and even a third of an inch. This\r\nrange of size corresponds to a range in the rate of fall from about\r\nfive feet a second for the smallest drops up to about twenty-five feet\r\na second for the largest. The maximum size of raindrops is limited by\r\nthe fact that very large drops are broken up in their fall through the\r\nair. Theoretically, the limiting size is somewhat less than the largest\r\nsizes found by Bentley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTS OF RAINDROPS FROM A THUNDERSHOWER\r\n\r\n_Collected and Photographed by W. A. Bentley_]\r\n\r\nWhile rain is often the final product of snow that melts before it\r\nreaches the ground, snow is probably never formed from raindrops, but\r\nalways condensed directly from water vapor. The finest snow consists\r\nof separate ice crystals, while snowflakes of larger sizes are always\r\nmade up of several crystals partly melted together. The flakes on rare\r\noccasions attain a diameter of three or four inches, and larger sizes\r\nhave been reported.\r\n\r\nFor ages mankind has admired the diversity of beautiful forms exhibited\r\nby snow crystals. Drawings of such crystals, and also of the frost\r\ntracery on window-panes, were made as early as the sixteenth century,\r\nby the learned Swedish historian Olaus Magnus, and many collections of\r\nsimilar drawings have been published since his time; but nowadays the\r\ncombination of the camera and the microscope gives us a far greater\r\nwealth of information concerning these interesting objects. Bentley,\r\nwhose study of raindrops we have just mentioned, has made and published\r\nphotomicrographs of hundreds of different forms of snow and ice\r\ncrystals, and several collections have been published in Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of the facts revealed by the camera is that the perfectly regular\r\nforms of these crystals seen in drawings are comparatively uncommon in\r\nsnow as it reaches the ground. A snow crystal is so fragile that it\r\nis easily mutilated by the wind and by contact with other crystals.\r\nIn very calm weather and at the beginning of a snowstorm many single\r\nand perfect crystals are wafted gently to the ground, and their beauty\r\nis revealed when they fall on dark objects, especially if they are\r\nexamined with a magnifying glass. In spite of their immense variety\r\nin detail, all perfect snow crystals and other ice crystals have six\r\nsides or principal rays. When secondary rays form they are parallel\r\nwith the adjacent primary rays. There are two principal forms of ice\r\ncrystal--the tabular and the columnar. Sometimes the two forms are\r\ncombined; a column or rod of hexagonal section will have at one or both\r\nends a hexagonal plate. Both the size and the shape of snow crystals\r\ndepend to some extent upon the temperature of the air. The smallest\r\ncrystals form in the coldest weather. Star-shaped crystals are most\r\nabundant when the temperature is not far below freezing, while at lower\r\ntemperatures there is a preponderance of hexagonal plates.\r\n\r\nThe cohesive character of moist snow, which is utilized by the younger\r\ngeneration in the making of snowballs and snow men, enables this\r\nsubstance to assume naturally a variety of striking forms. Thus a\r\nstrip of snow lying along a window ledge or the branch of a tree, will\r\nsometimes slip down in the middle and hang in festoon-shape, supported\r\nonly at the ends, constituting a “snow garland.” Over a level or\r\ngently sloping surface of snow the wind occasionally rolls muff-shaped\r\nsnowballs, which are known as “snow rollers.” Thousands of them are\r\nsometimes formed at once, and the largest may grow to the size of\r\nbarrels. Huge overhanging caps of snow formed on tree stumps, posts,\r\nand the like have been aptly named “snow mushrooms” by Mr. Vaughan\r\nCornish, who has described those that occur in great numbers in the\r\nSelkirk Mountains of western Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ICE STORM AT PHILADELPHIA, DECEMBER, 1914. The\r\nbranches are broken by heavy deposits of glaze. The photograph in the\r\nupper left corner, by Dr. David Fairchild, shows a glaze-incased twig.\r\n(_Photographs from U. S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest of all the shapes assumed by snow is seen in the\r\ngreatest perfection in the high Andes of tropical Argentina and Chile.\r\nHere are found innumerable pinnacles of snow or glacier ice, averaging\r\nfrom four to seven feet in height, though sometimes much higher. Viewed\r\nfrom a distance, they bear an uncanny resemblance to throngs of\r\nwhite-robed human beings, and they have thus acquired the Spanish name\r\nof _nieve de los penitentes_ (“snow of the penitents”). In the abridged\r\nform _nieve penitente_ this name is now applied to more or less similar\r\nformations in other mountainous regions. Fine examples are found in the\r\nHimalaya, and one of the Himalayan peaks has been named Mount Nieves\r\nPenitentes. The origin of these pinnacles has been the subject of\r\nmuch discussion. Sunshine and wind both appear to take part in their\r\nformation. Some remarkable “snow honeycombs,” approaching the form of\r\n_nieve penitente_, are produced in hot, dry summer weather among the\r\nglacier fields of Mount Rainier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NIEVE PENITENTE IN THE ARGENTINE ANDES\r\n\r\n(_Photograph by Dr. Juan Keidel._)]\r\n\r\nSnow has its economic aspects, comparable in importance to those of\r\nrain. The problem of snow-removal crops up every winter in our American\r\ncities, and is not always solved with brilliant success. In the larger\r\ncities of Europe snow is removed by spreading salt on the streets to\r\nreduce the snow to slush, which is then washed into the sewers with\r\nwater, but this method does not seem to be generally applicable to the\r\nheavier snowfall of this country. The snow-removal conference held by\r\na number of municipal engineers in Philadelphia in 1914 brought this\r\ndifficult phase of street cleaning prominently before the engineering\r\nworld, and it has been actively discussed in recent years in the\r\ntechnical journals. Snow presents a formidable problem in the operation\r\nof many railway lines, the solution of which takes the form of snow\r\nsleds, fences, plows of various types, flangers, gasoline torches for\r\nmelting snow in switches, etc.\r\n\r\nEconomically, snow is perhaps most important in its effects on water\r\nsupply, and this is true especially of mountain snowfields, the melting\r\nof which feeds adjacent streams. There are great areas in our Western\r\nStates where the water required for irrigation is obtained almost\r\nentirely from melting snow. The mountain slopes constitute natural\r\nreservoirs, from which the moisture that falls in the winter as snow\r\nis gradually fed through the spring and summer to the surrounding\r\ncountry. In these regions extensive “snow surveys” are sometimes made\r\nin the early spring, in order to ascertain the total amount of water\r\navailable. Professor J. E. Church, of the University of Nevada, was\r\none of the pioneers of this idea, and both he and the experts of the\r\nWeather Bureau have developed ingenious apparatus and methods for\r\nmaking rapid estimates of the snowfall and its equivalent volume of\r\nwater lying over a given area. The snow surveyor travels over the\r\nwatershed, often on skis or snowshoes, cutting sections of snow with\r\na cylindrical “snow sampler” and weighing them with a small spring\r\nbalance. The Weather Bureau also maintains in the Western mountains a\r\nnumber of special stations at which daily measurements of snowfall are\r\nmade for the benefit of irrigation projects. The use of “snow bins”\r\nand other forms of gauge for holding an entire winter’s snowfall--thus\r\nobviating the necessity of frequent measurement--has not proved very\r\nsatisfactory in this country. An analogous device, known in French as\r\na _totalisateur_, is, however, very extensively used in the Swiss and\r\nItalian Alps.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest snowfall in the United States occurs in the high Sierra\r\nNevada of California and in the Cascade Range of Washington and\r\nOregon. At places in both of these regions more than sixty-five feet of\r\nsnow has fallen in a single winter. The snow sometimes lies twenty-five\r\nfeet deep on the ground, burying one-story houses to the eaves.\r\n\r\nA fall of snow under a cloudless sky is fairly common in the polar\r\nregions and is sometimes observed in calm and very cold weather in\r\nthe temperate zones. Rain from a cloudless sky is a more doubtful\r\nphenomenon, of which only a few observations are recorded, most of\r\nthem of early date. If such rain occurs, it may come from clouds that\r\nhave passed beyond the horizon before the raindrops reach the earth.\r\nProbably the older reports of this phenomenon really relate to dew,\r\nwhich was once believed to fall from the sky.\r\n\r\nOf the three haillike forms of precipitation that we have mentioned\r\nabove, true hail is much the most important, on account of the large\r\nsize sometimes attained by hailstones and the damage that they are\r\nconsequently able to cause. The maximum possible size of a hailstone\r\ncannot be positively stated, but stones larger than a man’s fist\r\nand weighing over a pound have several times been reported on good\r\nauthority. During a hailstorm in Natal, on April 17, 1874, stones fell\r\nthat weighed a pound and a half and passed through a corrugated iron\r\nroof as if it had been made of paper. Hailstones fourteen inches in\r\ncircumference fell in New South Wales in February, 1847. At Cazorla,\r\nSpain, on June 15, 1829, houses were crushed under blocks of ice, some\r\nof which are said to have weighed four and one-half pounds. In October,\r\n1844, a hailstorm at Cette, France, wrecked houses and sank vessels.\r\nIn the state of Bihar, India, October 5, 1893, hail covered the ground\r\nto a depth of four to six feet; six persons were buried beneath it and\r\nperished, and hundreds of cattle were killed. In the Moradabad district\r\nof India, May 1, 1888, about 250 people were killed by hail. The\r\nvelocity attainable by falling hailstones is perhaps most strikingly\r\nshown by the fact that, even when falling obliquely, they have been\r\nknown to pierce a pane of glass with a clear round hole, like a bullet\r\nhole, leaving the rest of the pane intact.\r\n\r\nHail appears to be formed in the violent updraft of air at the front of\r\na thunderstorm. In this turbulent region the hailstone, first frozen\r\nat a high level, probably makes several journeys alternately up and\r\ndown, as it encounters stronger or weaker rising currents; at one time\r\ngathering a coating of snow aloft, and at another a coat of ice from\r\nthe rain below, until finally, on account of its large size or on\r\naccount of a weakening of the upward blast, it falls to the ground. A\r\nrecord of these ups and downs in the life of a hailstone is seen in the\r\nconcentric layers of clear and snowlike ice of which it is composed.\r\n\r\nAlthough, from immemorial usage, we still speak conventionally of\r\nthe “falling of the dew,” it has now been known for more than a\r\ncentury--especially since the publication of Wells’s “Essay of Dew” in\r\n1814--that dew does not fall. The cooling of air below the dew point of\r\nits water vapor by contact with any cold object results in a deposit\r\nof visible moisture, which is liquid or frozen, according to whether\r\nthe temperature is above or below the freezing point, respectively.\r\nThis process is not exclusively nocturnal. It is observed by day in\r\nthe familiar “sweating” of ice pitchers and also in the appearance\r\nof moisture on pavements, stone walls, and the like, in places shaded\r\nfrom the sun. At night the rapid cooling of the earth by radiation,\r\nespecially (but not, as often stated, exclusively) under a clear sky\r\nand in still weather, favors this condensation of moisture, in the\r\nliquid form, as dew, or in the frozen form, as hoarfrost. The deposit\r\noccurs most copiously on objects that lose heat rapidly by radiation\r\nand gain it but slowly by conduction. Water vapor exhaled from the\r\ntissues of plants and from the soil undoubtedly contributes its quota\r\nto the moisture available for condensation, but this hardly seems to\r\nbe a reason for asserting, as some writers have done, that dew comes\r\nmainly from the earth rather than the air.\r\n\r\nHoarfrost is often described as “frozen dew.” This expression is\r\nmisleading, for, although dew-drops are sometimes frozen into little\r\nglobules of ice, hoarfrost is more often condensed directly from\r\natmospheric water vapor in the shape of ice crystals.\r\n\r\n“Glaze” and “rime”--to use the latest official designations of the\r\ntwo kinds of ice coating formed from water in the atmosphere--differ\r\ngreatly in appearance, as a rule, though transition forms are sometimes\r\nfound. Glaze is produced by the falling of rain on surfaces whose\r\ntemperature is below freezing, and is typically smooth and transparent.\r\nRime is a rough deposit formed from fog, the drops of which are\r\n“undercooled”--i. e., are below the freezing point--and turn to ice on\r\ncoming in contact with solid objects. The most remarkable examples of\r\nrime are seen on mountains and in the polar regions. It occurs on the\r\nbranches and leaves of trees, and on the corners and edges of upright\r\nobjects, rather than on horizontal surfaces. In drifting fog it grows\r\nmost rapidly if not entirely on the windward side of objects--i. e., it\r\nbuilds up against the wind. On Ben Nevis it has been observed to grow\r\nat a rate of more than an inch an hour. Trees, posts, telegraph poles,\r\nand the like are thus eventually changed to shapeless masses of rough\r\nor feathery ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWINDS AND STORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the movements of the atmosphere constitutes a rather\r\nformidable branch of science known as _dynamic meteorology_.\r\nThis subject has engaged the attention of a number of able\r\nphysicists--though far too few--and has begun to assume the character\r\nof an exact science, but is still fruitful of unverified hypotheses.\r\n\r\nWe shall have only a little to say here about the theories and\r\nhypotheses relating to atmospheric circulation. They are at present, to\r\na notable degree, in process of revision. Important modifications in\r\nthem have resulted from the revelations of upper-air research, as well\r\nas from progress in other fields of inquiry. There are, however, a few\r\nfundamental matters that we must not ignore. We shall start with the\r\nsolar heat that keeps the atmospheric machinery in motion.\r\n\r\nOf the heat that comes to us from the sun, it is estimated that more\r\nthan one-third is reflected by clouds and the earth, or scattered by\r\ndust and air molecules, and thus passes back into space without having\r\nhad any effect in heating the atmosphere. Part of the remainder heats\r\nthe atmosphere directly, and the rest indirectly, after first heating\r\nthe underlying land and water. In both cases, certain atmospheric\r\ngases--notably water vapor--absorb a great deal more heat than others.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the production of a wind is a difference in\r\ntemperature between two parts of the earth’s surface, and hence of the\r\noverlying air. Such contrasts of temperature always exist, both locally\r\nand on a large scale. The high sun of the equatorial regions heats the\r\nearth much more strongly than the low sun of high latitudes; a water\r\nsurface has a more equable temperature than an adjacent land surface;\r\na stretch of bare earth is warmer by day and colder by night than a\r\nneighboring tract covered with vegetation; and so on. Differences in\r\natmospheric temperature produce differences in pressure, which gravity\r\ntends to adjust by setting up a circulation.\r\n\r\nThe exact manner in which this circulation is begun and maintained is\r\nnot yet perfectly clear, and current ideas on the subject are difficult\r\nto put into brief language. Meteorological writers now lay less stress\r\nthan formerly upon the lateral spreading, at high levels, of air that\r\nhas been heated and expanded at the earth’s surface, and the inward\r\nflowing of the lower air toward the heated area. There is, we know, an\r\ninitial impulse that tends to drive air from a region of high pressure\r\ntoward a region of low pressure; but the actual movement of the air is\r\nanother matter. The “life history” of an air current is found to be a\r\nvery devious affair.\r\n\r\nThe important fact, for practical purposes, is that air does not flow\r\nin a straight line from the place where the pressure is high to that\r\nwhere it is low. As soon as it begins to flow it curves from the\r\nstraight path, in accordance with Ferrel’s Law, which is thus stated:\r\n\r\n“In whatever direction a body moves on the surface of the earth, there\r\nis a force arising from the earth’s rotation that deflects it to the\r\nright in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern\r\nhemisphere.”\r\n\r\nThis law applies to all bodies moving freely over the earth, and not\r\nmerely to the winds.\r\n\r\nAt the earth’s surface, if the atmospheric pressure is measured\r\nsimultaneously at various places by means of barometers, we can get a\r\nclear picture of the horizontal distribution of pressure by drawing on\r\na map lines, called _isobars_, through places at which the pressure\r\nis identical. The isobars reveal the presence of extensive areas over\r\nwhich the pressure is above the average and of others over which it\r\nis below the average. If, at the same time, we chart the flow of air\r\nby indicating the direction of the winds at various points, we shall\r\nnotice that the air shows a strong tendency to travel _around_ these\r\nareas; and if we could observe its course a thousand feet or so above\r\nthe earth we should find the tendency even more pronounced at that\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nAnother important law, springing in part from Ferrel’s Law and\r\ndescribing the movements of the air around areas of high and low\r\npressure, is called Buys Ballot’s Law. One way of stating this law is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“If you stand with your back to the wind, in the northern hemisphere,\r\nthe barometer will be lower on your left than on your right. The\r\nreverse is true in the southern hemisphere.”\r\n\r\nThe reader, whether he lives in the United States or any other\r\ncivilized country, will have no difficulty in securing documentary\r\nevidence of the correctness of Buys Ballot’s Law in the shape of the\r\ndaily weather maps issued by the various meteorological services. On a\r\nweather map showing conditions anywhere in the northern hemisphere it\r\nwill be found that the winds (which are indicated by little arrows),\r\nthough subject to a good many local variations, have a general tendency\r\nto blow in the direction followed by the hands of a clock (“clockwise”)\r\naround an area of high pressure, and in the opposite direction\r\n(“counterclockwise”) around an area of low pressure. It will likewise\r\nbe noticed that, in general, the winds, instead of blowing along the\r\nisobars, are strongly inclined inward in the case of a low-pressure\r\narea and outward in the case of a high-pressure area. Lastly, if the\r\nmap indicates the force of the winds at different places, it will be\r\nseen that winds are strongest where the isobars are close together and\r\nweakest where they are far apart.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of much interest to aeronauts that the force of the\r\nwind generally increases with altitude, and that, in the lower flying\r\nlevels, the winds are little, if any, inclined to the isobars.\r\n\r\nThe spacing of the isobars is called the _barometric gradient_. One of\r\nthe conventional ways of expressing a gradient numerically is to state\r\nthe horizontal difference of pressure, in hundredths of an inch, for an\r\ninterval of fifteen nautical miles; but meteorologists as a rule merely\r\ndescribe gradients as “steep,” “gentle,” “moderate,” etc., without\r\nindicating their numerical values.\r\n\r\nIf the great difference in temperature between the equatorial and polar\r\nregions were the only factor in the control of atmospheric circulation,\r\nthere would be a strong barometric gradient between these regions and\r\nthere would result a simple circulation of winds, blowing poleward\r\nfrom the equator aloft and equatorward from the poles at the earth’s\r\nsurface. The former tendency of writers on meteorology and physical\r\ngeography was to regard such a circulation as a substantial fact,\r\nthough modified by the effects of the earth’s rotation and various\r\nlocal causes. Thus the idea has prevailed of a wholesale, direct\r\nexchange of air between the poles and the equator. Nowadays we can\r\nhardly maintain this idea, because we see that, on account of the great\r\ndeflections they undergo, the main drifts of air are approximately\r\nalong parallels of latitude and not along meridians of longitude.\r\nWithin the tropics the general drift of the lower air is from the east\r\n(and near the equator this drift prevails up to a great height); in\r\nmiddle latitudes it is from the west; and in the circumpolar regions\r\nit is again from the east. Air from the equator presumably does find\r\nits way to high latitudes, and _vice versa_, but neither rapidly nor\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the dominant feature of the whole circulation is the banking up\r\nof the air in so-called high-pressure belts at about latitude 30° North\r\nand South. From these “belts”--which are really broken up into separate\r\nareas of high pressure, and which shift north and south to a certain\r\nextent with the seasons--blow the northeast and southeast _trade\r\nwinds_, in the full development of which, found only over the Atlantic\r\nand the eastern Pacific, we have the most remarkable “permanent winds”\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\nBetween the trade wind belts lies the equatorial region of low\r\npressure, known as the “doldrums.” This is, in general, a region of\r\nlight and variable winds, heavy rains, and thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nIn the temperate zones of both hemispheres, on the poleward side of\r\nthe high-pressure belts above mentioned, the general drift of the\r\natmosphere near the earth’s surface is from west to east. In the south\r\ntemperate zone there is a very strong preponderance of west winds,\r\nespecially over the vast oceanic tract of the “roaring forties,” where\r\nblow the boisterous “brave west winds,” well known to sailors. The\r\ncorresponding belt of the northern hemisphere, which includes all but\r\nthe southernmost part of the United States, is described as a region of\r\n“prevailing westerly winds,” but it is also a region of storm tracks,\r\nand hence, as local episodes in the general movement of the atmosphere\r\nfrom west to east, there are constant shifts of the wind to all points\r\nof the compass, for reasons that will presently be explained.\r\n\r\nOn the poleward borders of the two belts of “prevailing westerlies,” a\r\nlittle outside the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, there are zones of low\r\npressure. That of the southern hemisphere is a continuous girdle around\r\nthe earth, and has the lowest pressures found anywhere in the world.\r\nThe corresponding subarctic zone, while fairly continuous in summer,\r\nis broken up in winter by the formation of high-pressure areas over\r\nSiberia and northern Canada.\r\n\r\nThe permanent ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are regions of\r\nhigh pressure, with calm air in the interior and strong outblowing\r\nwinds at the borders. Furious blizzards prevail at the margin of\r\nAntarctica.\r\n\r\nThe table on the opposite page will serve as a recapitulation of the\r\nfacts above stated.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  |                              NORTH POLE                           |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | Calms and high pressure over the interior of Greenland.           |\r\n  |   Out-blowing winds at the border.                                |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | More or less broken subarctic belt of low pressure.               |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | Prevailing westerlies (much interrupted by moving cyclones and    |\r\n  |   anticyclones).                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | Belt of high pressure at about lat. 30° N. “Horse latitudes,” or  |\r\n  |   “calms of Cancer.”                                              |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | Northeast trade winds.                                            |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | Equatorial belt of low pressure, calms, and variable winds.

The northeast trade winds of the Atlantic wafted Columbus to the\r\nNew World and aroused the misgivings of his sailors, who wondered how\r\nthey should ever sail homeward against them. The high-pressure belt\r\nnorth of these trade winds is a region of calms, which Maury called the\r\n“calms of Cancer.” This region, or a part of it, is likewise known as\r\nthe “horse latitudes,” the story being that, in the old sailing days,\r\nvessels laden with horses were often becalmed here so long that the\r\ncargoes had to be thrown overboard. As a matter of course, the prosaic\r\nmodern etymologist declines to accept this origin of the name and has\r\nproposed others less picturesque. The so-called equatorial calms, which\r\nlie mostly a little north of the equator, are often nicknamed the\r\n“doldrums,” or sometimes the “equatorial doldrums,” to distinguish them\r\nfrom other regions of dolorous, baffling calms. The doldrums vary a\r\ngreat deal in width and the masters of sailing ships try to cross them\r\nwhere they are narrowest.\r\n\r\nThe name of the trade winds implies that, according to the old nautical\r\nphrase, they “blow trade,” or constantly in one direction. Strictly\r\nspeaking, they vary considerably in direction, at any one spot, though\r\nthey are nearly always from an easterly quadrant, and they are even\r\nmore variable in force. The average speed of the Atlantic trades is\r\nabout eleven miles an hour. In view of the prospective requirements of\r\naeronauts, it is a fact of much interest that the trades are rather\r\nshallow winds. Their vertical thickness has been found, by observations\r\nwith pilot balloons and otherwise, to range from less than a mile\r\nto two or three miles. Some distance above the trades there are\r\nwinds blowing more or less in the opposite direction, known as the\r\n_counter-trades_. Aircraft will probably use the trade winds in flying\r\nfrom southern Europe to the Caribbean, and the countertrades on the\r\nreturn voyage to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the permanent or quasi-permanent winds just described,\r\nthere are certain important winds of the “periodic” type, which reverse\r\ntheir directions in the course of the year or from day to night. Some\r\nof these, also, first became generally known through the reports of\r\nmariners. The ancient Greek navigators utilized the monsoons in trading\r\nwith India; while we owe to the voyages of William Dampier, in the\r\nseventeenth century, one of the earliest and best descriptions of land\r\nand sea breezes.\r\n\r\nA monsoon is a wind that blows from a continent toward the sea in\r\nwinter, when the land is colder than the water, and in the opposite\r\ndirection in summer, when the reverse conditions of temperature\r\nprevail. The pressure gradient is reversed with the seasons, and\r\nthe wind varies accordingly. The most striking example of monsoon\r\nwinds is found in southern Asia--where these winds are of special\r\neconomic importance because they control the rainfall of India--but\r\nwell-developed monsoons also occur in Australia and West Africa, over\r\nthe Caspian Sea, on the coast of Texas, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAn analogous reversal of gradients, due to the change of temperature\r\nover the land from day to night, is of common occurrence on the shores\r\nof large bodies of water, resulting in land and sea breezes (or land\r\nand lake breezes). The breeze blows from the land to the water by night\r\nand in the opposite direction by day. These breezes are generally best\r\ndeveloped and most regular within the tropics, and particularly on\r\nshores adjacent to mountains. East Indian fishermen put out to sea with\r\nthe land breeze in the early morning and come home with the sea breeze\r\nin the afternoon. The refreshing and health-giving character of the sea\r\nbreeze of tropical climates has earned it the sobriquet of “the doctor.”\r\n\r\nMountain and valley breezes furnish another example of diurnally\r\nreversed winds. Relatively cold and heavy air drains down from the\r\nupper slopes by night, constituting the mountain breeze. By day the air\r\nin the valley is warmed and expanded, and as it is confined laterally\r\nby the sides of the valley it flows up the slopes, constituting the\r\nvalley breeze. Long before meteorologists undertook to classify the\r\nwinds of the globe, these mountain air currents attracted attention and\r\nacquired local names. Among the Alps, alone, we find scores of such\r\nnames. In many cases, too, the breezes have acquired a legendry of\r\ntheir own. Thus the _pontias_, a cold, nocturnal wind that blows out of\r\na narrow valley opening upon the plains of the Rhône near the town of\r\nNyons, is said to have been brought thither in a glove by St. Cæsarius,\r\nArchbishop of Aries, for the purpose of improving the fertility of the\r\nvalley! There is a quaint little book about the pontias, published\r\nby Gabriel Boule in 1647, in which the author sets forth at length\r\nthe arguments for and against the miraculous origin of this wind. The\r\nItalian lakes are especially rich in locally named mountain and valley\r\nbreezes.\r\n\r\nParenthetically it may be remarked that wind nomenclature in general\r\nis a vast subject, owing to the habit that prevailed in prescientific\r\ntimes, and still prevails to some extent among nonscientific people,\r\nof giving individual names to the winds characteristic of different\r\nlocalities. As a matter of curious interest, we set down here some of\r\nthese names (a small fraction of the total number):\r\n\r\n_Khamsin_, _leveche_, _leste_, _levanter_, _pampero_, _zonda_,\r\n_papagayo_, _buran_, _purga_, _brickfielder_, _southerly burster_,\r\n_williwaw_, _willy-willy_, _pontias_, _vésine_, _solore_, _joran_,\r\n_morget_, _rebat_, _vaudaire_, _breva_, _tivano_, _ora_, _Wisperwind_,\r\n_Erlerwind_, _Rotenturmwind_, _vent du Mont Blanc_, _vent d’aloup_,\r\n_autan_, _tramontana_, _gregale_, _imbat_, _kite and junk winds_,\r\n_bad-i-sad-o-bist roz_ (the furious “wind of 120 days” of Persia and\r\nAfghanistan).\r\n\r\nThe present writer has collected several hundred local wind names--and\r\nis constantly adding to the list.\r\n\r\nThere are several other types of wind peculiar to mountains besides the\r\nalternating mountain and valley breezes. Most of these are descending\r\nwinds, or “fall winds,” which may blow by day as well as by night. Thus\r\na strong daytime wind sometimes blows down from lofty snowfields and\r\nglaciers. A _foehn_ (pronounced like “fern,” but without the _r_) is a\r\nwind that has been robbed of most of its moisture through precipitation\r\non the windward slope of mountains and which is further dried, and also\r\nstrongly heated by compression, in descending the leeward slope. Winds\r\nof this type are common in the Alps, where they were first described\r\nand named, and their heat and aridity led to the belief that they came\r\nby way of the upper atmosphere from the distant deserts of Africa. Now\r\nthat their origin is better understood, we find that foehns prevail in\r\nmany other mountainous countries throughout the world, including the\r\nwestern United States, where they are called _chinooks_. When the foehn\r\nblows in winter, it causes snow to disappear with amazing rapidity--not\r\nonly melting it, but speedily drying the ground--whence it has earned\r\nthe name of “snow eater” in America, and “_Schneefresser_,” which means\r\nthe same thing and a little more, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe _bora_ of the Adriatic and the _mistral_ of southern France are\r\nwinds that blow from a cold, mountainous interior down to a warm\r\ncoastal region, where they arrive as relatively cold winds, in spite\r\nof the dynamic heating they have undergone in their descent. The bora\r\nis sometimes moderate (_borina_) and at other times a tremendous gale\r\n(_boraccia_), while the mistral has been known to blow a railway train\r\nfrom the track in the valley of the Rhône.\r\n\r\nThe _blizzard_ is a wind of which Americans once thought they had\r\nalmost a monopoly until Sir Douglas Mawson located the “home of the\r\nblizzard” on the shores of the Antarctic continent. The true blizzard,\r\nwhether American or Antarctic, is a violent, intensely cold wind,\r\nheavily charged with snow. Such winds are a characteristic feature of\r\nthe winter climate of our Middle Western States. Although the name of\r\nthis wind first became current as recently as the seventies of the last\r\ncentury, nobody knows its origin. Nowadays the name is often loosely\r\napplied to big snowstorms that are not really blizzardlike.\r\n\r\nThe dry “hot winds” that sometimes wither the crops of our western\r\nplains are the American antithesis of the blizzard. These winds belong\r\nto the great sirocco family--the name “sirocco” having become, in\r\nrecent scientific usage, a generic designation for extensive hot winds,\r\nwhether dry or moist, as distinguished from local hot winds, such as\r\nthe foehn.\r\n\r\nThe _harmattan_ of West Africa is a dry, dusty wind from the Sahara,\r\nand one that feels relatively cool; perhaps on account of causing rapid\r\nevaporation from the skin. The _simoom_ (with a final _m_), especially\r\nthe variety blowing in southern Asia, is perhaps the hottest and most\r\nparching of all winds--judging from its effects on animal life.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the winds above enumerated are merely minor\r\nfeatures of what are called _cyclonic_ and _anticyclonic_ wind systems.\r\nReverting to what has been said about weather maps and Buys Ballot’s\r\nLaw--if the reader will examine a series of maps for successive days,\r\nhe will notice that the areas of high pressure and low pressure are not\r\nstationary, but show a more or less rapid displacement, the general\r\ndirection of which, in our latitudes, is from west to east. The fact\r\nthat there are great traveling vortices or swirls in the atmosphere,\r\nwhich, in whatever regions they occur, partake of the general drift\r\nof the air around the globe, has been known for about a century, and\r\nconstitutes the corner stone of practical meteorology. In the temperate\r\nzone, where these swirls are sometimes of moderate force and sometimes\r\nvery stormy, they are the chief factor in controlling changes of\r\nweather from day to day, and their observation is the basis of weather\r\nforecasting. Within the tropics, where they are much less frequent\r\nand are confined to a few restricted regions, they are always violent\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nAn area of high pressure, with its attendant system of winds, is called\r\nan _anticyclone_ or _high_. An area of low pressure, with its winds, is\r\ncalled a _cyclone_--sometimes. The word “cyclone” was invented by Henry\r\nPiddington in the year 1848. Nearly all the early studies of cyclones\r\nwere made chiefly for the benefit of mariners, and related to the\r\nsevere revolving storms encountered at sea. Hence the word “cyclone”\r\npassed into the general vocabulary with a connotation of violence,\r\nwhich, in everyday speech, it still retains. Perhaps the early\r\n“cyclonologists” themselves hardly realized that a “gentle cyclone” was\r\nnot a contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\nMeteorologists are still so much under the influence of the popular\r\nidea of a “cyclone” that they hesitate to apply this term to a\r\ndisturbance of moderate force, except in a few special phrases (such\r\nas “extra-tropical cyclone”), though the adjective “cyclonic” is\r\nused freely without reference to the force of the wind. British\r\nmeteorologists speak mostly of “depressions,” while American\r\nmeteorologists speak of “lows.” The status of the latter term, as well\r\nas that of the term “high,” is, however, paradoxical. Though both\r\nwords have been used for years, they are nearly always printed with\r\nquotation marks around them, as if they had not yet been assimilated in\r\nthe vocabulary. The Weather Bureau has lately taken to printing these\r\nwords in capital letters. Neither of these practices will be followed\r\nin the present book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTO BY PROF. ELLERMAN SHOWING CLOUDS OR FOG CASCADING\r\nTHROUGH LAST FORK CAÑON AND INTO THE SANTA ANITA CAÑON. (_Letter from\r\nF. A. Carpenter, May 29, 1919._)]\r\n\r\nTropical cyclones are called “hurricanes” in the West Indies and the\r\nSouth Pacific, “typhoons” off the east coast of Asia, “baguios” in\r\nthe Philippines, and “cyclones” in the Indian seas. They form in the\r\ndoldrums, and generally take a long, sweeping course, curving westward\r\nand poleward, and sometimes passing into the temperate zones, where\r\nthey either die out or increase in size, diminish in violence, and\r\nbecome similar to the storms originating in the higher latitudes. One\r\nof the curious features they often exhibit within the tropics is the\r\ncalm center at the “eye of the storm,” to which Tennyson alludes when\r\nhe writes of the blast (unknown to meteorologists) that drove a ship\r\n\r\n  Across the whirlwind’s heart of peace,\r\n  And to and thro’ the counter-gale.\r\n\r\nThese cyclones are the worst of all storms found at sea, and also\r\nexercise their destructive effects over islands and along continental\r\ncoasts. The greatest disasters attending them have been due to the\r\ninundation of low-lying shores by the huge waves they generate, as\r\nin the Galveston hurricanes of 1900 and 1915 and in the far worse\r\ncatastrophes that have occasionally visited the coast of India.\r\nHurricanes of the West Indies occur chiefly from August to October,\r\ninclusive. The number varies from none to a dozen a year (with four as\r\nan average).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright, Ewing Galloway\r\n\r\nA CLOUDBURST NEAR CEDAR BRAKES, UTAH\r\n\r\nA snapshot taken from the edge of the cañon.]\r\n\r\nOver the large land areas of the north temperate zone highs and lows\r\nshow a tendency to travel over typical tracks, the locations of which\r\nvary a good deal with the season. One of the most remarkable facts\r\nabout the lows of North America is that, wherever they come from,\r\nwhether from the Canadian northwest, the western United States, or the\r\nWest Indies, they nearly always leave the continent by way of the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence or the northeastern corner of this country. Our North\r\nAmerican lows travel at an average speed of 600 miles a day. Highs\r\ntravel somewhat more slowly; about 540 miles a day is the average in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nA _tornado_ is a small vortex in the atmosphere, occurring generally in\r\nthe southeastern part of a cyclonic area, where, in some cases, several\r\nseparate tornadoes develop at the same time. The tornado, for some\r\nreason that is not altogether clear, is far more common in the interior\r\nof North America, east of the Rocky Mountains, than anywhere else in\r\nthe world, though true tornadoes do occur in other countries. The West\r\nAfrican storms bearing this name are merely thundersqualls, quite\r\ndifferent from the American tornado. The chief visible feature of a\r\ntornado is the so-called funnel-shaped cloud (sometimes balloon-shaped\r\nor, again, like a great coiling serpent), which is always in contact\r\nwith the ground when destruction is in progress. The passage of the\r\nstorm is attended by a loud roaring or rumbling. The path of a tornado\r\nvaries in width from a few rods to half a mile or (rarely) more. Within\r\nits borders buildings are blown to pieces, trees are uprooted and human\r\nbeings only find safety underground; while even at a distance of a few\r\nyards outside the path no damage is done. The tornado travels at an\r\naverage speed of about twenty-five miles an hour. Its speed of rotation\r\nhas been estimated, from the effects produced, to amount to 500 miles\r\nan hour in some cases; a wind force far exceeding that of any other\r\ntype of storm.\r\n\r\n_Waterspouts_, which occur on the ocean and other large bodies of\r\nwater, are similar in character to tornadoes, though much less violent.\r\nThey range in height from 100 to 1,000 yards, or more. One measured\r\nrecently from the British steamer _War Hermit_, near Cape Comorin, was\r\n4,600 feet high to the base of the overlying cloud. The column tapered\r\nfrom 500 feet wide at the junction with the cloud to 150 feet wide at\r\nthe sea. Spray was thrown up to a height of more than 800 feet over a\r\nregion 250 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Thunderstorms_ occur chiefly in warm climates and during the warm\r\nseason in temperate climates, but they are by no means unknown in the\r\npolar regions. They are characterized by rapidly rising air currents,\r\nwhich may be either incidental to the circulation of a low, or due\r\nto local overheating of the lower atmosphere. In the former case\r\nthey are called “cyclonic thunderstorms,” and in the latter “heat\r\nthunderstorms.” This is only a rough classification, however. Some\r\nthunderstorms partake of the features of both these types, and, on the\r\nother hand, additional classes are distinguished by many authorities.\r\nIt is a common occurrence for thunderstorm conditions, starting in\r\nsome small area, to travel across country at a speed of perhaps thirty\r\nor forty miles an hour, at the same time spreading out fanwise until\r\nthe front of the storm is hundreds of miles in length. This front\r\nconstitutes a “line squall” (so called from the long line or apparent\r\narch of dark cloud that marks its location), and is attended by more\r\nor less thunder and lightning, but is not necessarily a continuous\r\nthunderstorm. The characteristic wind of a thunderstorm is the squall\r\nthat rushes out in front of the storm when close at hand. This blast\r\nof wind, lightning, hail and torrential rain are all agencies of\r\ndestruction in severe thunderstorms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDEAL CROSS SECTION OF A TYPICAL THUNDERSTORM\r\n\r\n_A_, ascending air; _D_, descending air; _C_, storm collar; _D’_, wind\r\ngust; _H_, hail; _T_, thunderheads; _R_, primary rain; _R’_, secondary\r\nrain. (W. J. Humphreys.)]\r\n\r\nConcerning the winds of the globe in general and the remarkable\r\natmospheric interchanges that they involve, Sir Napier Shaw writes:\r\n\r\n“Of the millions of tons of air which form the atmosphere nearly the\r\nwhole is moving. The regions of calm at the surface at any one time,\r\ntaken all together, do not form a large part of the earth’s surface,\r\nand above the surface calm regions are still rarer. Let us remember\r\nthat the motion of the air is always ‘circulation’; air cannot move\r\nforward or backward or upward or downward without displacing other air\r\nin front of it and being replaced by other air behind it, though the\r\ncirculation may be quite local and limited in extent, as is frequently\r\nthe case when warm air rises or cold air sinks. In the course of\r\ninvestigations into the life history of surface air currents in the\r\nMeteorological Office we have traced air over long stretches of the\r\nsurface of the Atlantic. We have found, on one occasion, the shores\r\nof Greenland to be fed with air that left the middle of the Atlantic\r\nfour days previously, while in the course of six days air traveled from\r\nSpitsbergen to join the northeast trade wind off the west coast of\r\nAfrica. On another occasion the air that formed the wind off the south\r\nof Ireland was traced back to the north of Africa, but that which blew\r\nat the opening of the Channel two days later came from Hudson Bay, via\r\nthe Azores.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the ever-shifting currents of the ocean of air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy has read how Benjamin Franklin, by means of his famous\r\nkite experiment, demonstrated the electrical nature of lightning, and\r\nhow the same versatile genius invented the lightning rod. It is not\r\nproposed to repeat familiar history here. Neither shall we discuss\r\nthe dubious statements frequently put forth that lightning rods were\r\nknown before Franklin’s time, nor consider how much credit is due\r\nthe many philosophers who, at earlier periods, suspected lightning\r\nto be a manifestation of electricity. The facts and ideas concerning\r\natmospheric electricity that we have to present in this chapter were,\r\nfor the most part, quite unknown to Franklin and to many generations of\r\n_savants_ after him, and some of them are just now finding their way\r\ninto the textbooks.\r\n\r\nScience still recognizes the existence of two kinds of\r\nelectricity--positive and negative--which, by combining, neutralize\r\neach other’s effects. According to current ideas, however, the more\r\nactive agent in electrical phenomena is negative electricity, which\r\nis believed to consist of (or to provide electrical charges for)\r\nexceedingly minute particles called _electrons_.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago the smallest thing that science had to deal\r\nwith was the atom, and the lightest of atoms is that of hydrogen.\r\nThe discovery of electrons marks a new step toward the infinitely\r\nlittle. The mass of the electron--or, in more popular and less exact\r\nterms, its weight--is about 1/1800 that of a hydrogen atom. As to its\r\nsize: Imagine a billiard ball magnified to the size of the earth. Its\r\nconstituent atoms would be the actual size of billiard balls, but the\r\nelectrons of which each atom is composed would still be too small to be\r\nseen with the naked eye. Now imagine each of these billiard-ball atoms\r\nfurther magnified to the size of a large church. The electrons would\r\nthen be about as big as one of the periods on this page.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that a body has an electrical charge we mean that it has\r\nan _excess_ of positive or negative electricity. An ordinary molecule\r\nof an atmospheric gas contains (or perhaps actually consists of)\r\nequal amounts of the two kinds of electricity, and is therefore not\r\ncharged. There are, however, various ways in which an electron may\r\nbe detached from such a molecule, leaving it positively charged; and\r\nagain it may receive an extra electron, and thus acquire a negative\r\ncharge. Under the former circumstances it becomes a _positive ion_,\r\nand under the latter a _negative ion_. Ions play a very important role\r\nas carriers of electricity, because they are impelled to move toward\r\noppositely charged bodies or particles and combine with them. A gas\r\ncontaining ions is said to be _ionized_; and it is the ionization of\r\nthe atmosphere that makes it a conductor of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe number of ions in a given volume of air has been the subject\r\nof a great many measurements, both at observatories on land and in\r\nthe course of scientific expeditions at sea. There are ingenious\r\ninstruments called “ion counters,” in which air is drawn at a measured\r\nrate through the apparatus and its electrical effects are noted.\r\nThe number of positive ions found in a cubic centimeter of the lower\r\natmosphere varies from a few hundred to a thousand or more, while the\r\nnumber of negative ions in the same space is generally one or two\r\nhundred smaller. The ionization is about the same over the ocean as\r\nover the land.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which the air may become ionized. The\r\ndifferent rays given off by radioactive substances (Alpha, Beta, and\r\nGamma rays) all have the power of driving off electrons from the\r\nmolecules of gases; i. e., ionizing them. Air is undoubtedly ionized by\r\nradioactive matters in the soil (radium and thorium) and especially by\r\nthe gaseous “emanations” of these substances in the atmosphere, which\r\nare also radioactive. It has, however, been a problem to account for\r\nionization over the ocean; because the amount of radioactive matter\r\nin sea water is immeasurably small, while the amount of radioactive\r\nemanation in sea air is, according to the latest observations, only\r\nabout 2.5 per cent of that occurring over the land.\r\n\r\nThe clue to this mystery seems to be found in a special kind of Gamma\r\nrays coming from some region far above the surface of the earth. These\r\nrays are called the “penetrating radiation,” because they not only are\r\nable, like the Gamma rays due to radioactive substances on earth, to\r\npass through the walls of hermetically sealed metal vessels and ionize\r\nthe air inside, but they also have the power of passing through a great\r\nextent of atmosphere without being absorbed. They are estimated to be\r\nabout ten times as “penetrating” as the Gamma rays coming from known\r\nterrestrial substances. The best proof that a radiation of this sort\r\ncomes from above is that when closed metal vessels are carried up in\r\nballoons, there is, above an altitude of about half a mile, a rapid\r\nincrease in the rate at which ions are produced within them. As to the\r\nsource of this radiation, one suggestion has been that it comes from\r\nstrongly radioactive cosmic dust in the upper atmosphere. A hypothesis\r\nthat seems more plausible at present attributes it to the bombardment\r\nof the atmosphere by electrons shot off from the sun.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of ions in the atmosphere is one of the recent\r\nacquisitions of science. On the other hand, it has been known for\r\nsome generations that the earth has normally a negative charge as\r\ncompared with the air, or the air a positive charge as compared with\r\nthe earth. Thus between the earth and any point in the air (except,\r\nas we now know, at great altitudes) there is a difference of what is\r\ncalled “potential,” of such a character that negative electricity will\r\nfollow any conductor provided for it away from the earth. Variations\r\nof potential with altitude have long been measured by means of\r\ninstruments called “collectors,” which gather, so to speak, a sample\r\nof the electrical charge of the air at any point and enable it to\r\nbe compared with that of the earth. The difference of potential is\r\nmeasured in volts per meter of vertical distance. Thus we get the\r\n“potential gradient,” which averages about 150 volts per meter in\r\nthe lowest part of the atmosphere. It is subject to great irregular\r\nvariations--especially during thunderstorms--and also to somewhat\r\nregular rises and falls during each day, and to an annual fluctuation,\r\nbeing much greater in winter than in summer.\r\n\r\nIt has also been known for a good many years that the air is a\r\nconductor of electricity--though a poor one--and, therefore, does not\r\ninsulate the earth. Dr. W. F. G. Swann has expressed the extremely\r\nsmall conductive capacity of the air for electricity in the statement\r\nthat a column of it one inch long offers as much resistance to the\r\npassage of an electrical current as a copper cable, of the same cross\r\nsection, thirty thousand million million miles long!\r\n\r\nA fact more recently learned, from observations in balloons, is that\r\nthe potential gradient falls off rapidly at high levels, and becomes\r\npractically zero at an altitude of about six miles. From this fact\r\nit is concluded that the lower six miles of the atmosphere contains\r\na charge of positive electricity just equal to the negative charge\r\nat the earth’s surface. In other words, the lower atmosphere is not\r\nonly positive with respect to the earth, but in an absolute sense it\r\ncontains an excess of positive electricity.\r\n\r\nThus we have a negatively charged earth surrounded by a layer of\r\npositively charged air. Since air is a conductor, it is not easy to see\r\nwhy the opposite charges of the earth and the atmosphere do not combine\r\nand neutralize each other. An interchange is, in fact, always going on\r\nbetween them; negative ions flow upward from the earth and positive\r\nions flow in the opposite direction. This “earth-air current” is,\r\nhowever, exceedingly small. Moreover, the opposite charges of the earth\r\nand air remain from year to year in spite of it.\r\n\r\nHow does the earth retain its negative charge and the air its positive\r\ncharge? No other question relating to atmospheric electricity has, in\r\nrecent years, been so much debated as this. Discussion centers, as a\r\nrule, upon the negative charge of the earth; for there are certain\r\nreasons for assuming that, when once this is explained, the positive\r\ncharge of the atmosphere will require no special explanation.\r\n\r\nOne hypothesis is that the earth is bombarded by positive and negative\r\ncorpuscles from the sun, and that the negative corpuscles have such\r\npenetrating power that they are able to reach the earth, while the\r\npositive corpuscles are caught by the atmosphere. Another hypothesis\r\n(Swann’s) is that the same “penetrating radiation” that, as we have\r\nseen, helps to ionize the lower atmosphere has the effect of driving\r\ndownward a stream of electrons detached from the air molecules, thus\r\nmaintaining a constant supply of negative electricity to the earth. The\r\nquestion is not yet settled.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to turn from these somewhat abstruse matters to a\r\nsubject of universal interest; viz., lightning. As recently as a few\r\ndecades ago, though there was already a copious literature on the\r\nsubject of lightning, very little was really known about it. Even its\r\nsuperficial features were strikingly misunderstood until the advent of\r\nphotographic methods of investigation. Thus until the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century sharply zigzag lightning flashes were represented\r\nin scientific books as they still are in conventional art. That\r\nso-called zigzag lightning is really sinuous was first asserted by\r\nJames Nasmyth, in 1856, and his contention was soon afterward confirmed\r\nby photography. The camera has revealed a large number of other\r\ninteresting things about lightning.\r\n\r\nEverybody has noticed an appearance of flickering in lightning flashes\r\nthat are of sensible duration. Several early investigators, such as\r\nArago, Dove, and O. N. Rood, had reached the conclusion that such\r\nflashes are multiple, consisting of several successive discharges\r\nalong an identical path. Rough measurements of the intervals of time\r\nbetween these discharges were made with various forms of rotating disk.\r\nFar more accurate information is now obtained on this subject by the\r\nuse of a camera mounted on a vertical axis and swung in a wide arc, at\r\na fixed rate, by clockwork. The perfection of this device is due, in\r\npart, to A. Larsen, in America, but especially to Dr. B. Walter, of\r\nHamburg, whose achievements in the photography of lightning far surpass\r\nthose of any other investigator.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if a discharge of lightning is not instantaneous,\r\nbut has a sensible duration, the rotary movement of the camera,\r\narranged as just mentioned, will spread out the image of the flash,\r\non the photographic plate, into a more or less broad band or ribbon.\r\nMost photographs of ribbonlike streaks of lightning made with ordinary\r\ncameras are, in fact, due to accidental movements of the apparatus\r\nduring exposure--such as an involuntary start of the operator, in case\r\nthe camera is held in the hands--though a certain amount of spreading\r\nof the image is sometimes caused by what photographers call “halation.”\r\nPictures taken with the revolving camera show that some flashes are\r\npractically instantaneous while others may last as long as half a\r\nsecond or more. Those of the latter class nearly always show several\r\nparallel streams of light, more or less distinctly separated by darker\r\nspaces. Each of these bright streams represents a separate discharge\r\nalong the common path. As the speed with which the camera turns is\r\nknown, it is possible to determine the intervals of time between the\r\ndischarges of a multiple flash. These intervals may vary from a few\r\nthousandths to one or two-tenths of a second, while the duration of\r\neach of the consecutive discharges is probably not more than two or\r\nthree hundred-thousandths of a second in most cases. Sometimes the path\r\nof the lightning flash is shifted by the wind while the picture is\r\nbeing taken. In one case this shift was estimated at 36 feet.\r\n\r\nPhotography is also applied to determining the distance of a lightning\r\nflash and hence the dimensions of any of its features. For this purpose\r\na stereoscopic method is used, two cameras being mounted side by side\r\nand exposed at the same time. Sometimes one of the cameras is made to\r\nrevolve, while the other remains stationary. The stationary camera\r\nwill then show the relative positions of the flashes occurring during\r\nexposure, while the moving camera will indicate the times at which they\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nStreaks of “black lightning” and black borders of the white flashes,\r\nboth often seen in photographs, are a trick of the camera and are due\r\nto what is called the “Clayden effect.” Some kinds of plates are much\r\nmore susceptible to this effect than others. When a flash of lightning\r\nhas registered its impression on such a plate, and, before the shutter\r\nis closed, another flash occurs, the general illumination of the field\r\nby light reflected from clouds, etc., often “reverses” the original\r\nimage, and consequently it prints black.\r\n\r\n“Sheet lightning” presents the appearance of a diffuse glow over the\r\nsky. When lightning of this character is seen playing about the horizon\r\non summer evenings, in the absence of an audible thunderstorm, it is\r\noften called “heat lightning.” Most sheet lightning is probably a mere\r\nreflection of ordinary streak lightning below the horizon or hidden\r\nby clouds. Some authorities believe, however, that diffuse, silent\r\ndischarges actually occur in the clouds. Balloonists claim to have\r\nencountered such discharges near at hand. An analogous phenomenon is\r\nthe glowing of so-called “incandescent” or self-luminous clouds, to\r\nwhich several observers have called attention. A remarkable phenomenon\r\nof somewhat similar character has been reported by Dr. Knoche, late\r\ndirector of the Chilean meteorological service, who states that it\r\noccurs on a vast scale along the crest of the Andes during the warm\r\nseason. The mountains seem to act as gigantic lightning rods, giving\r\nrise to more or less continuous diffuse discharges between themselves\r\nand the clouds, with occasional outbursts simulating the beams of\r\na great searchlight. These displays are visible hundreds of miles\r\nout at sea. Something akin to this so-called “Andes lightning” has\r\noccasionally been reported from other mountainous regions, including\r\nthe mountains of Virginia and North Carolina.\r\n\r\n“Beaded” lightning and “rocket” lightning are as rare as they are\r\ninteresting. The former resembles a string of glowing beads, while the\r\nlatter is a form of streak lightning that shoots up into the air at\r\nabout the apparent speed of a skyrocket.\r\n\r\n“Ball lightning” takes the form of a fiery mass (not always globular),\r\nwhich generally moves quite deliberately through the air or along the\r\nground, and in many cases disappears with a violent detonation. It\r\noccurs inside of buildings, as well as out of doors.\r\n\r\nIn order that a discharge of electricity may break through the\r\nresistance of the air along paths as long as those commonly observed,\r\nenormous differences of potential must exist in the atmosphere during\r\nthunderstorms. How such conditions arise has been the subject of\r\nan immense amount of speculation. The explanation now generally\r\naccepted was proposed in the year 1909 by the English physicist and\r\nmeteorologist, Dr. George Simpson. This hypothesis is based upon the\r\nfact, well attested by laboratory experiments, that the breaking up\r\nof drops of water involves a separation of positive from negative\r\nelectricity; in other words, the production of both positive and\r\nnegative ions. In this process the drops become positively charged;\r\ni. e., they retain a greater number of positive than of negative\r\nions, the latter being set free in the air. About three times as many\r\nnegative as positive ions are thus released.\r\n\r\nNow a thunderstorm is accompanied by strong upward movements of the\r\nair; so strong that small drops cannot fall to the ground, while large\r\ndrops, which would be heavy enough to fall through such rising currents\r\nif they could retain their integrity, are broken up by the blast of air\r\nand carried aloft, where they tend to accumulate, recombine, and fall\r\nagain. This process may be repeated many times, so that the positive\r\ncharge of the drops is continually increasing, and at the same time\r\nnegative ions are being set free and carried by the ascending air to\r\nthe upper part of the clouds. Here they unite with the cloud particles\r\nand give them a strong negative charge. Thus eventually there is formed\r\na heavily charged positive layer of cloud between a heavily charged\r\nnegative layer above and the negatively charged earth beneath. When\r\nthe differences of potential thus brought about become great enough,\r\ndisruptive discharges of electricity will occur, and these may be\r\neither between the upper and lower layers of cloud or between the\r\nclouds and the earth, or, sometimes, between two different clouds.\r\n\r\nProbably much the most frequent lightning flashes are those that occur\r\nwithin a single thundercloud and do not reach the earth. However, it\r\nwill often happen that the negatively charged upper layer of cloud is\r\neither carried very high or drifted away by the wind, and then the\r\ndischarges that occur will be chiefly between cloud and earth. Such\r\nconditions are likely to prevail in the case of cyclonic thunderstorms,\r\nin which there is often great difference in the direction and force of\r\nthe winds at different levels. On the other hand, heat thunderstorms\r\nusually occur when the general winds are light at all levels, and it\r\nis probable that such storms are relatively free from cloud-to-earth\r\ndischarges. We seem to have here an explanation of the paradox that\r\ntropical thunderstorms, which are nearly always of the noncyclonic\r\ntype, though notoriously violent, are generally harmless.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from what has been said above that the mystery\r\nof the lightning flash is now fully resolved. This is far from being\r\nthe case. It is not at all clear how an electrical discharge can break\r\ndown the resistance of the air along a path a mile or more in length,\r\nas commonly happens in the thunderstorm. It was formerly stated, on\r\ngood authority, that the difference of potential required to produce\r\nsuch a flash would amount to upward of 5,000,000,000 volts. Certain\r\nfacts have lately been adduced to show that such great differences\r\nof potential need not be assumed. Moving-camera photographs of the\r\nsparks produced by electric machines show that such sparks begin with\r\nsmall brush discharges which gradually ionize the air and thus build\r\nup a conductive path for the complete discharge. Something of this\r\nkind may occur in the atmosphere. Streaks of air already strongly\r\nionized and more or less continuous sheets of rain would also help to\r\nprovide conductors for a discharge. If lightning does build up its\r\npath somewhat gradually, the process might, in certain cases, be so\r\nslow as to account for the deliberate movement of rocket lightning,\r\nand also, perhaps, furnish a clue to the hitherto unsolved mystery of\r\nball lightning. Humphreys has tentatively suggested that all genuine\r\ncases of ball lightning are “stalled thunderbolts”; i. e., lightning\r\ndischarges that have come to a halt, or nearly so, in their progress\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\nAs to the visibility of lightning Humphreys says, in his “Physics of\r\nthe Air”:\r\n\r\n“Just how a lightning discharge renders the atmosphere through which it\r\npasses luminous is not definitely known. It must and does make the air\r\npath very hot, but no one has yet succeeded, by any amount of ordinary\r\nheating, in rendering either oxygen or nitrogen luminous. Hence it\r\nseems well-nigh certain that the light of lightning flashes owes its\r\norigin to something other than high temperature, probably to internal\r\natomic disturbances induced by the swiftly moving electrons of the\r\ndischarge, and to ionic recombination.”\r\n\r\nA few attempts have been made to measure the strength of current in a\r\nlightning discharge. Many substances become magnetized when an electric\r\ndischarge occurs in their vicinity, and it has been pointed out by F.\r\nPockels that when basalt rock is magnetized in this way the amount of\r\nmagnetism is an indication of the greatest strength of current to which\r\nit has been exposed. Pockels examined specimens of basalt from the top\r\nof Mount Cimone, in the Apennines, where lightning strokes are common,\r\nand found many of them more or less magnetized. He also exposed blocks\r\nof basalt close to a branch of a lightning rod in the same region.\r\nHe thus obtained values for the strength of current in lightning\r\ndischarges ranging from 11,000 to 20,000 amperes. Humphreys, from the\r\ncrushing effect of a lightning stroke upon a hollow lightning rod,\r\nhas computed the strength of current in the case examined to be about\r\n90,000 amperes.\r\n\r\nThe effects of lightning are so various that it would take a book to\r\ndescribe them all. Its audible effects are discussed in our chapter\r\non atmospheric acoustics. Its chemical effects consist chiefly in the\r\nproduction of oxides of nitrogen, ozone, and probably ammonia from\r\nthe constituents of the atmosphere along the path of the discharge,\r\nand these substances, either directly or after further combinations\r\nin the atmosphere, contribute to the fertility of the soil. Lightning\r\nsometimes bores holes several feet deep in sandy ground and fuses\r\nthe material along its path, forming the glassy tubes known as\r\n_fulgurites_. Similar holes are bored in solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe destructive effects of lightning are due chiefly to the heat\r\ngenerated by the passage of an electric current through a poor\r\nconductor. When moisture is present in the object struck, its sudden\r\nconversion into steam produces the explosive effects seen in the\r\nshattering of trees, the ripping of clothes from the human body, etc.\r\nThere is almost no end to the curious pranks played by lightning--some\r\ndisastrous, some comical, and some benevolent, as when persons crippled\r\nwith rheumatism, after having been knocked down and temporarily stunned\r\nby a stroke of lightning, have found themselves completely cured of\r\ntheir malady! A well-known book by Camille Flammarion, translated\r\ninto English under the title “Thunder and Lightning,” is almost wholly\r\ndevoted to these eccentricities of the lightning stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LIGHTNING PRINT ON THE ARM OF A BOY STRUCK BY\r\nLIGHTNING NEAR DUNS, SCOTLAND, IN 1883\r\n\r\n_Drawn from a photograph taken a few hours after the accident__. From\r\nthe Lancet._]\r\n\r\nThere is a very common belief that lightning sometimes impresses a\r\nphotographic image of trees or other objects of the landscape upon the\r\nhuman body. The ramifying pink marks, known as “lightning prints,”\r\noften found on the skin of persons who have been struck by lightning,\r\nare, however, in no sense photographic, but are merely the lesions due\r\nto the passage through the tissues of a branching electric discharge.\r\n\r\nA few practical suggestions in regard to danger from lightning are\r\noffered by Humphreys, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Generally it is safer to be indoors than out during a thunderstorm,\r\nand greatly so if the house has a well-grounded metallic roof or\r\nproperly installed system of lightning rods. If outdoors it is far\r\nbetter to be in a valley than on the ridge of a hill, and it is always\r\ndangerous to take shelter under an isolated tree--the taller the tree,\r\nother things being equal, the greater the danger. An exceptionally tall\r\ntree is dangerous even in a forest. Some varieties of trees appear to\r\nbe more frequently struck, in proportion to their numbers and exposure,\r\nthan others, but no tree is immune. In general, however, the trees\r\nmost likely to be struck are those that have either an extensive root\r\nsystem, like the locust, or deep tap roots, like the pine, for the very\r\nobvious reason that they are the best grounded and therefore offer, on\r\nthe whole, the least electrical resistance.\r\n\r\n“If one has to be outdoors and exposed to a violent thunderstorm, it\r\nis advisable, so far as danger from lightning is concerned, to get\r\nsoaking wet, because wet clothes are much better conductors, and dry\r\nones poorer, than the human body. In extreme cases it might even be\r\nadvisable to lie flat on the wet ground. In case of severe shock,\r\nresuscitation should be attempted through persistent artificial\r\nrespiration and prevention from chill.\r\n\r\n“The contour of the land is an important factor in determining the\r\nrelative danger from lightning because the chance of a discharge\r\nbetween cloud and earth, the only kind that is dangerous, varies\r\nsomewhat inversely as the distance between them. Hence thunderstorms\r\nare more dangerous in mountainous regions, at least in the higher\r\nportions, than over a level country. Clearly, too, for any given region\r\nthe lower the cloud the greater the danger. Hence a high degree of\r\nhumidity is favorable to a dangerous storm, partly because the clouds\r\nwill form at a lower level and partly because the precipitation, and\r\nprobably therefore the electricity generated, will be abundant. Hence,\r\ntoo, a winter thunderstorm, because of its generally lower clouds, is\r\nlikely to be more dangerous than an equally heavy summer one.”\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the total property loss due to lightning in the\r\nUnited States is about $8,000,000 a year, and the number of persons\r\nstruck about 1,500, of whom one-third are killed. Nine-tenths of these\r\naccidents occur in rural localities.\r\n\r\nLightning rods neither prevent lightning stroke nor do they, as is\r\nsometimes alleged, attract lightning to buildings. They merely provide\r\ngood conductors along which a stroke of lightning may reach the earth\r\nwithout doing damage, and, within very moderate limits, determine the\r\npath of discharge. While there are many unsettled points regarding the\r\ntheory of lightning rods and details of construction, their general\r\nutility is strikingly indicated by statistics showing the comparative\r\namount of damage done by lightning to rodded and unrodded buildings.\r\nAccording to the United States Bureau of Standards, information\r\ngathered in this country shows that “taking rods as they come in\r\nthe general run of installations, they reduce the fire hazard from\r\nlightning by 80 to 90 per cent in the case of houses, and by as much\r\nas 99 per cent in the case of barns.” The same bureau, in its valuable\r\npublication, “Protection of Life and Property Against Lightning”\r\n(Washington, 1915), supplies the answers to a multitude of questions\r\nthat are constantly asked about lightning rods.\r\n\r\nBuildings with metal roofs and frames connected with the ground are\r\ngenerally well protected from lightning (except as to nonmetallic\r\nchimneys) without rods.\r\n\r\nDuring actual thunderstorms, and also at other times when there\r\nare high potential gradients in the atmosphere, luminous electric\r\ndischarges of a more or less continuous character are sometimes\r\nobserved to occur in the shape of small jets and flames, chiefly from\r\npointed objects, including lightning rods, the masts and spars of\r\nvessels, the angles of roofs, etc. These are identical in character\r\nwith the “brush” discharges, or incomplete sparks, produced by electric\r\nmachines. They are accompanied by a hissing or crackling sound. Their\r\nluminosity is comparatively feeble, and for this reason they are much\r\nmore often observed by night than by day. They are especially common\r\nduring snowstorms.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is known as _St. Elmo’s fire_ or _corposants_ (not to\r\nmention a score of other names, ancient and modern). As seen at sea,\r\ncorposants sometimes take the form of one or two starlike objects at\r\nthe trucks of the masts or the ends of yard arms, but occasionally the\r\nspars, rigging and other parts of the ship are lighted up with a great\r\nnumber of stationary or moving flames, producing a weird spectacle. The\r\nfinest examples of corposants are, however, observed on high mountains,\r\nand the phenomenon has been carefully studied at certain mountain\r\nobservatories, such as those on Ben Nevis and the Sonnblick.\r\n\r\nOf its occurrence on Ben Nevis, Angus Rankin writes: “The most frequent\r\nmanner in which it makes its appearance is as caps of light on the tips\r\nof the lightning rod, but occasionally it appears as jets of flame\r\nprojecting from all objects on the top of the tower and from the cowl\r\nof the kitchen chimney, which rises from the roof at some distance\r\nfrom the tower. These jets are at times from 4 to 6 inches in length,\r\nand make a peculiar hissing sound. During a very brilliant display,\r\nthe observer’s hair, hat, pencil, etc., are aglow with the ‘fire,’\r\nbut, except for a slight tingling sensation in the head and hands, he\r\nsuffers no inconvenience from it. On such occasions, if a stick be\r\nraised above the head, jets of electric light will be seen at its upper\r\nend. The only drawback to observing it with advantage is the unpleasant\r\ncharacter of the weather in which it appears, namely blinding showers\r\nof snow and hail, and squally winds, causing a good deal of snowdrift.”\r\nRankin records that it was sometimes _heard_ in the daytime, when its\r\nlight was invisible. On the Sonnblick a display of St. Elmo’s fire has\r\nbeen observed to last as long as eight hours.\r\n\r\nNo luminous electrical phenomenon is more beautiful or, at first sight,\r\nmore mysterious than the _aurora_, popularly known, in the northern\r\nhemisphere, as the “northern lights.” This phenomenon is due to the\r\npassage of electrical discharges through the rarefied gases of the\r\nupper atmosphere, and it now appears to be settled beyond controversy\r\nthat the discharges are caused by corpuscles or radiations of some kind\r\nemitted from the sun.\r\n\r\nMost accounts of the aurora describe the typical appearances that it\r\nassumes as seen from a single place on the surface of the earth, but\r\nsay little, if anything, about the form of the phenomenon as a whole\r\nor about its position in space. We shall follow a different plan here,\r\nand ask the reader, first of all, to imagine himself viewing the aurora\r\nfrom a point some thousands of miles away from our planet.\r\n\r\nThe solar emission above mentioned, when sufficiently intense, produces\r\nin the upper atmosphere a glow like that seen in a vacuum tube when\r\nan electrical discharge passes through it. From our vantage point in\r\nouter space we shall notice that this glow is not spread over the\r\nwhole globe, but forms two rings, which encircle the polar regions of\r\nboth hemispheres, though neither the geographic nor the magnetic poles\r\nlie at their centers. The rings do not extend down into the lower\r\natmosphere, but hang about 60 miles above the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this segregation of the aurora in high latitudes is\r\nthat the earth is a great magnet, and magnets have the power of\r\ndeflecting an electrical discharge in their vicinity. An appearance\r\nmuch resembling the two auroral zones of the earth was produced, on\r\na small scale, by the late Professor Kr. Birkeland of Christiania,\r\nwho magnetized a metal globe and allowed an electrical discharge to\r\nplay upon it in a vacuum. The surface of the globe was coated with\r\na phosphorescent substance, which glowed under the discharge in two\r\nrings, corresponding roughly to those of the aurora. In both cases the\r\ndischarge follows what are called the magnetic “lines of force.” Our\r\nearth, like other magnets, is enveloped and penetrated by such lines.\r\nAt any point on the earth the direction of the neighboring lines of\r\nforce is shown by the dipping needle, which assumes a position parallel\r\nto them. At a magnetic pole the needle points straight up and down,\r\nand everywhere in high latitudes it has a position not very much\r\ninclined to the vertical, while in low latitudes it is more or less\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nIf, now, for the sake of simplicity we confine our attention to the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and imagine ourselves maintaining our watch for\r\nmonths and years together, we shall discover that much of the time\r\nthere is no ring to be seen; at other times there may be a small or\r\npartial ring; and occasionally there is a very broad, conspicuous ring,\r\nspreading so far south that it overlies the northern part of the United\r\nStates and most of Europe. Evidently the emission from the sun that\r\ncauses the auroral discharge varies greatly in strength, and this is in\r\naccordance with what we know about solar activities in general.\r\n\r\nNext let us take a closer look at the ring, whether from outer space or\r\nfrom the earth’s surface. We shall find that it is made up, at least\r\nin part, of a multitude of luminous beams directed out into space and\r\nundergoing rapid changes in position and form. These beams, which\r\nreally mark out the streams of the discharge in the upper air, follow\r\nthe lines of force. In high latitudes they are nearly vertical with\r\nrespect to the underlying surface of the earth. Even in the United\r\nStates (when the aurora extends so far south) they are much more nearly\r\nvertical than horizontal. A dipping needle will show, at any place,\r\njust how they should stand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF LIGHTNING. This double\r\nphotograph was made by Dr. B. Walter of Hamburg, the leading expert in\r\nthe field of lightning photography. The picture at the left was taken\r\nwith a stationary camera. The photograph at the right, taken at the\r\nsame time with a revolving camera, shows that one of the main flashes\r\n(the one to the right) was a single discharge, and the other a multiple\r\ndischarge.]\r\n\r\nFrom any distant point on the earth’s surface either north or south of\r\nit, the visible portion of the auroral ring presents the appearance\r\nof an arch across the horizon. Arctic explorers, far within the\r\nArctic Circle, see this arch to the south of them. In our latitudes\r\nit spans the northern horizon. Separate beams or streamers may be\r\ndistinguishable or not, according to the brightness of the discharge\r\nor its distance from the point of observation. Combinations of beams\r\nconstitute so-called “draperies.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF LIGHTNING, SHOWING “BLACK” FLASHES.\r\n(_graph by F. Ellerman._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY INSTRUMENTS ON BOARD\r\nTHE “CARNEGIE.” Left: Penetrating radiation apparatus. Right:\r\nactive-content apparatus. Below: Arrangement for supplying potentials\r\nto electroscopes and ionization chambers, (_Carnegie Institution._)]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, at times of great solar activity, part of the ring\r\nactually overlies our Northern States, and the aurora then becomes a\r\nmagnificent spectacle in this part of the world. The whole sky may be\r\nfilled with the shifting streamers, along which travel rapid pulsations\r\nof light, so that the phenomenon then suggests strongly what it really\r\nis--a vast electrical discharge passing down through the atmosphere\r\nfrom outer space. When the observer is thus surrounded by the beams,\r\nthey seem, on account of perspective, to converge toward a point south\r\nof the zenith, where they form a beautiful _corona_ or crown. The\r\nposition of this crown depends upon the slant of the beams, which, as\r\nalready explained, follow the lines of force.\r\n\r\nA brilliant aurora is always accompanied by disturbances of the\r\nmagnetic needle, which moves about erratically, so that compasses can\r\nno longer be depended upon. At the same time there are strong “earth\r\ncurrents,” which interfere with the operation of telegraph lines.\r\n\r\nObservations with the spectroscope seem to show that the light of the\r\naurora is chiefly due to glowing nitrogen, though the most prominent\r\nline in the auroral spectrum has sometimes been referred to an\r\nunknown atmospheric gas. The various colors seen in bright auroras,\r\nincluding reds, greens, and yellows, are believed by some authorities\r\nto depend upon the varying speed of the electrical discharge.\r\nExperiments with vacuum tubes show that nitrogen, especially, gives\r\ngreat changes of color with changes in the velocity of the discharge.\r\nAnother interesting revelation of the spectroscope is that there is\r\napparently, a faint auroral illumination in the sky at all times and in\r\nall parts of the world, the so-called “permanent aurora.”\r\n\r\nPhotography has been used with great success in studying the aurora,\r\nespecially by the Norwegian physicists Störmer, Vegard, and Krogness.\r\nSimultaneous photographs of a single detail are taken from two points\r\nseveral miles apart against a background of stars. The apparent\r\nposition of the auroral detail among the stars will differ in the two\r\npictures, and a comparison of them makes it possible to determine the\r\nactual position of the aurora in space. A slow-moving cinematograph has\r\nalso been used to obtain series of pictures. The measurements of these\r\nobservers show that the base of the aurora is, generally between 60 and\r\n70 miles above the earth with a strong tendency to assume a definite\r\nlocation at an altitude of about 61 or 67 miles. Its upper limits are\r\nnot well defined, but it has been photographed up to an altitude of\r\nmore than 300 miles. Earlier observers reported seeing the aurora at\r\naltitudes of only a few miles, and even down to the earth’s surface,\r\nbut recent authorities are inclined to discredit these observations.\r\n\r\nOne more phenomenon of atmospheric electricity requires brief mention,\r\nviz., the electric waves that produce the erratic disturbances known to\r\nwireless telegraph operators as “strays” or “static.” As heard in the\r\nreceiver of a wireless outfit the noise of strays has been described as\r\n“like hailstones beating against a sheet of tin,” or “short hisses from\r\na steam pipe,” or “periodic discharges of coal down a chute.” Another\r\ncharacteristic sound is a sharp “click.” The study of strays has been\r\ncarried out on a world-wide scale by a committee of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, but their nature is not yet\r\nfully understood. Some strays are undoubtedly due to near or distant\r\ndischarges of lightning, and special forms of wireless apparatus, known\r\nas “thunderstorm recorders” or “ceraunographs,” have been used to give\r\nnotice of the approach of thunderstorms. On the other hand, strays\r\nseem frequently to have no connection with thunderstorms, and their\r\nprincipal origin is now sought in electrical disturbances in the upper\r\natmosphere, perhaps similar to those which cause the aurora, and, as in\r\nthe case of the aurora, having their ultimate source in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC OPTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we look up into the sky on a cloudless day we behold a continuous\r\ncanopy, the prevailing color of which is blue. This canopy is a veil\r\nthat hides the starry hosts beyond, and its presence seems, at first\r\nsight, incompatible with the fact that the air is a transparent medium.\r\nWe see the stars by night through the same intervening atmosphere.\r\nWhy are they cut off from our sight by day? The answer to this\r\nquestion can, perhaps, best be made plain by a simple experiment.\r\nPlace a lighted candle behind a sheet hung across a room not otherwise\r\nilluminated. The flame of the candle will be distinctly visible through\r\nthe sheet. Next, let the room be brightly lighted, say with electric\r\nlight or daylight. The candle can now no longer be seen through the\r\nsheet, owing to the bright illumination of the latter as compared with\r\nthe feeble light of the candle.\r\n\r\nIn the atmosphere the counterpart of our sheet is a layer, several\r\nmiles in depth, of minute particles, which by day are lighted up by\r\nthe sun. Some of the particles are tiny dust motes, others are fine\r\ndroplets of water or bits of ice, and the rest are the molecules of the\r\natmospheric gases themselves. It is the light that comes to us from\r\nthese particles that makes our eyes insensitive to the fainter light of\r\nthe stars, and makes the sky itself a visible luminous vault.\r\n\r\nNext, why is the clear sky generally blue, rather than some other\r\ncolor? To answer this question, we must recall the fact that sunlight\r\nis made up of ether waves of many different sizes. In combination,\r\nthese waves produce upon our eyes the sensation of white light. When\r\nthey are separated, as by passing through a prism, the smallest\r\nwaves--or, in more technical language, the vibrations of shortest wave\r\nlength--register the sensation of violet, and the largest or longest\r\nwaves that of red. The whole sequence of colors runs in the order\r\nviolet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red (easily fixed\r\nin the memory by means of the word VIBGYOR, formed from the initial\r\nletters of these words).\r\n\r\nNow the passage of sunlight through the atmosphere is obstructed to\r\na certain extent, not only by suspended dust particles, but also by\r\nthe molecules of the air. Let us consider, first, the effect of air\r\nmolecules and of the finest dust particles, not much above molecular\r\nsize. These tiny objects have different effects on light waves of\r\ndifferent lengths. The longest waves are little disturbed by them, just\r\nas ordinary waves in water are little affected by a floating cork, for\r\ninstance. The shortest waves are so small in proportion to the size\r\nof the obstacles that they are diffused or scattered by them, as a\r\ntiny ripple in water might be broken up by a floating cork. It is this\r\ndiffuse light, of short wave length, that gives the sky its color. A\r\nlarge part of the violet and indigo light is lost by further scattering\r\nbefore it reaches the earth, leaving a preponderance of blue in the sky\r\nas we see it. When the air contains a considerable amount of suspended\r\nparticles larger than those above considered--whether in the form of\r\nsolid dust or crystals of ice or tiny droplets of water--light of all\r\nwave lengths is reflected by them, and the sky looks white or grayish.\r\n\r\nOn account of the action of atmospheric particles in filtering out the\r\nshorter light waves, as just described, sunlight becomes relatively\r\nrich in red and orange in passing through the air. When the sun is\r\nhigh, the path of the sunbeams to the earth is short, and the color\r\nof their light is but little affected. Near the time of sunrise and\r\nsunset, however, sunlight comes to us through a much greater extent\r\nof air, and the filtering process is much more effective. Hence the\r\nsunshine is both enfeebled and reddened when the sun is near the\r\nhorizon. The diffuse light of the sky around the sun is filtered in the\r\nsame manner, and therefore is commonly red when the sun is low.\r\n\r\nA gray sunset sky after a clear day is due to the presence of water\r\ndrops in the air, and indicates conditions favorable for rain,\r\nsince, unless the air were saturated to a considerable altitude, the\r\ncomparatively warm sunshine of the afternoon would favor evaporation\r\nrather than condensation of moisture. A gray sunrise sky has, as\r\na general rule, just the opposite meaning. It often indicates the\r\npresence in the air of water drops formed on dust particles during\r\nthe night, after the manner of dew, because the upper air has been\r\n_dry_ enough to permit rapid radiation from the dust. These drops will\r\nbe speedily evaporated by the rising sun, and the general dryness of\r\nthe atmosphere will not favor further condensation. Several familiar\r\nweather proverbs are thus justified, e. g.:\r\n\r\n  Evening red and morning gray\r\n  Help the traveler on his way;\r\n  Evening gray and morning red\r\n  Bring down rain upon his head.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting optical phenomena connected with\r\nsunrise and sunset, including, first of all, the morning and evening\r\ntwilight. When the sun, or any other heavenly body, is only a little\r\nbelow a clear horizon, it is still visible, on account of the\r\nbending of its rays by the atmosphere. This lifting effect, known\r\nas _astronomical refraction_, amounts to about half a degree (at\r\nthe horizon), which is about equivalent to the apparent diameter of\r\nthe sun or moon. As the sun sinks farther below the horizon, in the\r\nevening, the only daylight that comes to us is that reflected from\r\nthe upper levels of the atmosphere, which are still illuminated. This\r\nis called twilight, and it lasts until the sun is about 18 degrees\r\nbelow the horizon, when total darkness sets in. The period as a whole\r\nis sometimes called _astronomical twilight_, in distinction from the\r\nbriefer period known as _civil twilight_, during which there is light\r\nenough for outdoor occupations; the latter lasts from sunset until the\r\nsun is about 6 degrees below the horizon. Morning twilight is more\r\ncommonly called “dawn.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting succession of light and color effects is observed before\r\nand after sunset and, in inverse position and order, about sunrise.\r\nConsidering sunset only: After the sun has sunk out of sight, a broad\r\nband of golden light, called the _bright segment_, is seen along the\r\nwestern horizon. Above this, in the western sky, appears a more or less\r\ncircular expanse of rosy glow, known as the _purple light_. In the\r\neastern heavens, after sunset, there rises steadily from the horizon\r\nthe so-called _dark segment_, which is the blue or ashy shadow of\r\nthe earth on the sky. This is bordered above by the pink or purplish\r\n_antitwilight arch_. As time goes on, the purple light in the west,\r\nafter increasing in brightness for a while, finally sinks behind the\r\nbright segment; while in the east the rising dark segment encroaches\r\nupon and finally obliterates the antitwilight arch. Sometimes, in clear\r\nweather, there is a fainter repetition of these lights and colors\r\n(_second purple light_, etc.).\r\n\r\nAmong the Alps and other snow-capped mountains, these sunset and\r\nsunrise phenomena assume a particularly beautiful form, known as the\r\n_Alpenglow_. In fine weather, just before sunset, the peaks to the\r\neastward begin to show a reddish or golden hue. This fades gradually,\r\nbut in a few minutes, when the sun is a little below the horizon of\r\nthe observer, but the peaks themselves are still bathed in direct\r\nsunlight, an intense red glow, beginning down the slopes, moves upward\r\nto the summits. This is identical with the antitwilight arch described\r\nabove. Presently this glow is succeeded by an ashy tint, as the peaks\r\nare immersed in the rising shadow of the earth (the dark segment).\r\nTheir rocks and snows assume a livid appearance, aptly described by\r\nthe inhabitants of Chamonix, whence the phenomena in question are\r\nwell seen on the summit of Mont Blanc, as the _teinte cadavéreuse_.\r\nIn ordinary weather darkness succeeds without any further notable\r\nphenomena, but occasionally there occurs a remarkable renewal of rosy\r\nlight upon the peaks, known as the _recoloration_ or _afterglow_. At\r\nChamonix this is termed the “resurrection of Mont Blanc.” The afterglow\r\nhas been variously explained, but it is probably due, mainly at least,\r\nto the reflection of the purple light in the western sky. Sometimes\r\nit lasts until an hour after sunset, and it passes away from below\r\nupward. On very rare occasions there is a second afterglow, presumably\r\nthe reflection of the second purple light mentioned above. Similar\r\nphenomena are often seen in reverse order at sunrise.\r\n\r\nA pretty phenomenon observed chiefly in the late afternoon and early\r\nmorning consists of beams of light radiating from the sun, known\r\ntechnically as _crepuscular rays_. The beams are made visible by the\r\npresence of abundant dust or water droplets in the atmosphere, and the\r\nintervening dark spaces are the shadows of clouds. When the sun is\r\nabove the horizon and the beams are directed downward, the phenomenon\r\nis popularly described as “the sun drawing water” and is regarded as a\r\nsign of rain. Sailors call these beams the “backstays of the sun,” and\r\nthey have several other names based upon the legendry associated with\r\nthem in different parts of the world. After sunset or before sunrise\r\na fanlike sheaf of the beams often extends upward from the western or\r\neastern horizon, respectively. The Homeric expression “rosy-fingered\r\ndawn” probably refers to this phenomenon. In all cases the apparent\r\ndivergence of these beams is an effect of perspective, as they are\r\nreally parallel. A rarer phenomenon is that of _anticrepuscular rays_,\r\nwhich appear to converge to a point opposite the sun. In this case the\r\nbeams and shadows are projected entirely across the sky, but their\r\npaths can very seldom be traced in the upper part of the heavens\r\nbecause in this direction the observer’s line of sight passes through a\r\ncomparatively shallow extent of dusty atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAn analogous phenomenon is seen in the shadows which near-by isolated\r\nmountain peaks frequently cast upon the sky opposite the sun at sunrise\r\nand sunset. Travelers have described such shadows cast by Adam’s Peak\r\nin Ceylon, Pike’s Peak in the Rocky Mountains, and Fujiyama in Japan.\r\nThe phenomenon is said to be especially striking in the polar regions,\r\nwhere the air is often heavily charged with particles of ice.\r\n\r\nOne more optical phenomenon of sunrise and sunset that requires mention\r\nhere seems to be comparatively little known to the nonscientific\r\npublic, notwithstanding the fact that it has supplied the subject and\r\ntitle of a diverting novel by Jules Verne. The conditions required\r\nfor its appearance are a clear and steady atmosphere and a sharply\r\ndefined horizon, such as that of the ocean. At the instant the sun is\r\nappearing or disappearing, and when only a very small segment of its\r\ndisk is visible above the horizon, this portion appears to be colored\r\na bright emerald green, sometimes blending into blue. This transient\r\nphenomenon is known as the _green flash_. It is best explained as due\r\nto the different degrees of refraction undergone by rays of different\r\nwave lengths coming to us from the sun. The effect of refraction in\r\nelevating the solar image as a whole when near the horizon has already\r\nbeen mentioned. This effect is a little greater for the green and blue\r\nrays than for the orange and red. It is still more pronounced for the\r\nviolet and indigo rays, but these are mostly sifted out of the solar\r\nbeams in their long passage through the atmosphere when the sun is low.\r\nHence at the upper edge of the solar image there is a narrow green or\r\nblue fringe, which is not, however, perceptible except when a screen\r\nis interposed between the eye and the bright image of the sun. A sharp\r\nhorizon furnishes such a screen. Through a telescope it is possible,\r\nin suitable weather, to see the green flash--and also a corresponding\r\n“red flash” at the lower edge of the sun--by placing an opaque\r\ndiaphragm in the focal plane of the object glass. Another explanation\r\nof the green flash--which could, however, account only for its\r\nappearance at sunset and not at sunrise--is that it is a physiological\r\neffect; the eye, fatigued by the reds and yellows that predominate in\r\nthe light of the setting sun, sees an “after image” of complementary\r\nhue the instant after the real image has disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to a group of phenomena, also due to atmospheric\r\nrefraction, which includes some of the most bizarre of optical\r\nillusions. The simplest of these phenomena consists of a slight\r\napparent elevation of all objects in the surrounding landscape through\r\n_terrestrial refraction_, which is identical in principle with\r\nastronomical refraction and depends upon the difference in density, and\r\nhence of refractive power, of the air at different levels above the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nNormally the air decreases in density at a nearly regular rate with\r\nincreasing altitude. Sometimes, however, this change in density is\r\ngreatly modified by local effects of temperature. Over a cold surface\r\nof land or water the adjacent air may be abnormally dense, resulting\r\nin an unusually rapid decrease of density with altitude. Over a hot\r\nsurface, as in the case of a desert under strong sunshine, the adjacent\r\nair may become so much rarefied that, for a certain distance upward,\r\nthere is actually an increase of density with ascent, instead of the\r\nreverse. The rays of light coming to us from distant objects are bent\r\nin different directions and to various degrees by virtue of these\r\nabnormalities in the density of the atmosphere. The apparent positions\r\nof such objects depend upon the angle at which the light rays, coming\r\nfrom them, strike the eye of the observer. Sometimes the objects appear\r\nto be lifted far above their true positions (a phenomenon known as\r\n_looming_) and sometimes depressed far below them; and occasionally\r\nlocal irregularities in air density produce curiously distorted images\r\nof these objects.\r\n\r\nMost of these strange effects are known collectively as _mirage_. There\r\nare many varieties. There is the “desert mirage,” first made famous\r\nthrough the experience of Napoleon’s soldiers in Egypt. There are\r\nmirages that suspend the images of remote objects in the sky; sometimes\r\ninverted, sometimes right side up. There is the lateral mirage,\r\noccasionally seen when one looks along the face of a heated wall or\r\ncliff. Lastly, there are the complex displacements and distortions\r\nof objects known as the _Fata Morgana_--a name originally applied to\r\na phenomenon of this kind visible, on rare occasions, at the Straits\r\nof Messina, but now used generically for similar appearances in other\r\nparts of the world. Some of the finest examples of Fata Morgana are\r\nwitnessed in the polar regions.\r\n\r\nIn the desert mirage an image of the lower part of the sky is brought\r\ndown to earth and simulates the appearance of water, while the images\r\nof terrestrial objects, also depressed and inverted by the mirage,\r\nlook like the reflections of the same objects upon the liquid surface.\r\nHumphreys says: “This type of mirage is very common on the west coast\r\nof Great Salt Lake. Indeed, on approaching this lake from the west one\r\ncan often see the railway over which he has just passed apparently\r\ndisappearing beneath a shimmering surface. It is also common over\r\nsmooth-paved streets, provided one’s eyes are just above the street\r\nlevel.” The confusing and obscuring effects of the desert mirage\r\nwere illustrated during the fighting between the British and Turks in\r\nMesopotamia, in April, 1917, when, according to the report of General\r\nMaude, a battle had to be suspended on account of one of these optical\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATA MORGANA ON THE COAST OF GREENLAND\r\n\r\n(_From drawing by Scoresby_)]\r\n\r\nThe strong vertical contrasts in air temperature that occur in the\r\npolar regions produce many remarkable examples of mirage. The pictures\r\nand descriptions of those observed a century ago along the coast of\r\nGreenland by Captain William Scoresby, Jr., have become classical. A\r\nrecent episode connected with mirage was the expedition sent north in\r\n1913 to explore “Crocker Land,” which Peary believed he had sighted\r\nfrom an elevated point in Grant Land in 1906, and which for a time\r\nfigured on all maps of the Arctic. The later explorers found no land at\r\nthe place indicated, but they observed the same mirage that Peary had\r\nmistaken for distant hills and mountains.\r\n\r\nCurrents of air of different densities produce, through their varying\r\neffects on atmospheric refraction, the twinkling or scintillation of\r\nthe stars, as well as of distant terrestrial lights. Twinkling is much\r\nmore violent near the horizon than near the zenith, and more pronounced\r\non some nights than others. The shimmering of the air over heated\r\nsurfaces faces and the “boiling” of celestial objects as seen in the\r\ntelescope are analogous phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INFERIOR MIRAGE\r\n\r\n(_From American Museum Journal. Drawing by Chester A. Reeds._)\r\n\r\nOut-of-doors when a layer of warm rarefied air arises from contact\r\nwith heated ground or warm water, occupying a position below the\r\ncolder, more dense normal air, two images of a distant object may be\r\nseen--one inverted beneath the other. This is “_inferior mirage_” and\r\nis explanatory of the appearance of trees and their reflections, which\r\nhaunts the desert traveler with the hope of water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUPERIOR MIRAGE\r\n\r\n(_From American Museum Journal. Drawing by Chester A. Reeds._)\r\n\r\nWhen a zone of warm rarefied air is sandwiched between normal air above\r\nand colder air below, a “_superior mirage_” of distant objects may be\r\nseen. Three images are produced, one above the other, the middle one\r\ninverted.]\r\n\r\nIn the refraction phenomena that we have thus far considered the air\r\nis the medium in which the light rays are bent and distorted. In the\r\nproduction of the _rainbow_, light undergoes refraction, dispersion\r\n(separation of the spectral colors) and reflection by passing through\r\ndrops of water in the atmosphere; especially falling raindrops.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow, perhaps because it is such a common sight, is seldom\r\nobserved with careful attention. Hence few people realize that there\r\nare many varieties of this beautiful meteor, and various erroneous\r\nideas about it are prevalent. The rainbow is always seen in the part\r\nof the sky opposite the sun--or the moon, in the case of the lunar\r\nrainbow--and is high in the heavens when the luminary is low, and low\r\nwhen the luminary is high. Generally less than a semicircle of the\r\nbow is visible, and never more, except from an eminence. (Aeronauts\r\noccasionally see a complete circle.) The outer border of the bow is\r\nred and the inner blue or violet. Contrary to popular belief and to\r\nstatements sometimes found in reference books, it is almost never\r\npossible to distinguish all seven of the spectral colors in a rainbow;\r\nfour or five is the usual limit.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary or _primary rainbow_ has a radius of about 42 degrees at\r\nits outer edge. Very commonly a _secondary_ rainbow is seen, concentric\r\nwith the primary bow, and having a radius of about 50 degrees. The\r\nsecondary is fainter than the primary, and its colors are in opposite\r\norder--red inside and violet outside. Additional bands of color,\r\nchiefly red and green, may often be detected adjacent to the inner\r\nedge of the primary bow and, less frequently, along the outer edge of\r\nthe secondary bow. These are known as _supernumerary bows_. The space\r\nbetween the primary and secondary bows is somewhat darker than the rest\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nThe common rainbows differ much among themselves in the number and\r\npurity of their colors, the width of the bows, etc., these differences\r\ndepending especially on the size of the raindrops. The minute drops of\r\na fog sometimes give rise to a bow that is almost devoid of color--the\r\n“white rainbow,” or “fog bow.” The rainbows produced by the moon\r\ncommonly show little color, on account of the relative faintness of\r\nthe light, but the brighter lunar rainbows are often very distinctly\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERSECTING RAINBOWS\r\n\r\n(_After a sketch by T. Hodge. Courtesy of Scientific American._)]\r\n\r\n_Reflected rainbows_ are sometimes seen upon a sheet of water; and\r\nagain the image of the sun, as reflected by such a surface, may give\r\nrise to both primary and secondary rainbows in the sky, which appear\r\nto intersect those produced by the sun directly. A horizontal layer of\r\nwater drops below the level of the observer’s eye occasionally produces\r\nthe so-called _horizontal rainbow_. This may be formed over a bedewed\r\nfield or other surface (the “dew bow”); or the drops may be those of\r\na low-lying sheet of fog, or of water deposited on a floating film of\r\noil, or, finally, actual raindrops, seen from an elevation, such as the\r\nsummit of a mountain. Horizontal rainbows formed by rain have been seen\r\nfrom the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nThe common saying,\r\n\r\n  A rainbow in the morning\r\n  Is the shepherd’s warning;\r\n  A rainbow at night\r\n  Is the shepherd’s delight,\r\n\r\nis, on the whole, well justified for the following reasons: We see the\r\nrainbow where rain is falling, while the sun is shining in the opposite\r\npart of the sky. Our rainstorms usually come from the west and pass\r\naway to the east. A morning rainbow can only be seen in the west, and\r\nindicates that rain is approaching us. An evening rainbow (ignoring\r\nlunar bows) is seen only in the east, and shows that the rain area is\r\nreceding from us, giving place to clear skies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CIRCUMZENITHAL ARC\r\n\r\n(_From a drawing by L. Besson in La Nature._)\r\n\r\nParts of the halos of 22° and 46°, upper tangent arc of the 22° halo,\r\nand two parhelia are also shown. The circumzenithal arc is always\r\nbrightly colored.]\r\n\r\nIce crystals in the atmosphere, such as those composing the higher\r\nclouds, produce a great variety of optical phenomena, known as _halos_.\r\nSome phenomena of this class are common, others exceedingly rare.\r\nMoreover, there are several theoretically possible forms of halo\r\nof which observations have never yet been reported, so that halo\r\nobserving can be recommended to the amateur meteorologist as offering\r\nopportunities for making interesting discoveries.\r\n\r\nHalos take the form of narrow rings of definite angular size around\r\nthe sun or moon (not to be confused with the coronas, of variable\r\ndimensions, described below), rings passing through the luminary, arcs\r\nin various other positions, and roundish spots of colored or white\r\nlight. They may be seen separately or in combination. In rare cases,\r\na dozen or more different forms of halo are visible at the same time,\r\nproducing a most spectacular display. One of the most remarkable\r\ndisplays of this kind in the history of science was seen, in different\r\ndegrees of development, over the eastern United States on November 1\r\nand 2, 1913; an event which greatly stimulated interest in the study\r\nof halos in this country. Complex halos are quite common in the polar\r\nregions; where they are seen not only in the sky, but also in the air,\r\ncharged with ice particles, close to the earth.\r\n\r\nWhenever a thin veil of cirrus or cirro-stratus clouds overspreads the\r\nsky there is a likelihood that halos will be visible. Those formed\r\nnear the sun, however, frequently pass unnoticed, on account of the\r\ndazzling brightness of that luminary. Smoked or tinted glasses greatly\r\nfacilitate their observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAMS OF THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF HALO\r\n\r\n(_After Besson, Monthly Weather Review, July, 1914._)\r\n\r\n1.

When formed by the sun it generally\r\nshows a distinct reddish inner border and traces of other spectral\r\ncolors. The lunar 22-degree halo usually appears colorless. This halo\r\nis visible, in whole or in part, to the attentive observer about once\r\nin three days, on an average. Less common, but by no means rare, are\r\nthe _parhelia_ or “sun dogs” of 22 degrees (called _paraselenæ_ or\r\n“moon dogs” when formed by the moon), the beautiful _circumzenithal\r\narc_, and a few other members of the halo family. Most forms of halo\r\nare so uncommon that their appearance is an event of some scientific\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagrams, by Dr. Louis Besson of the Observatoire de\r\nMontsouris, show the positions, with respect to the sun (or moon), of\r\nthe majority of known halo phenomena. The upper diagram shows the halos\r\nthat occur on the same side of the sky as the sun (or moon), and the\r\nlower those that appear on the opposite side. Most of these halos, when\r\nbright, show the spectral colors. The circumzenithal arc, _h_ (commonly\r\ndescribed, by the uninitiated, as a “rainbow”), and the parhelia of 22\r\ndegrees, _e, e′_, are especially brilliant in their coloration. The\r\n_parhelic circle, m_, which sometimes extends entirely around the sky,\r\nis white, and so are a few of the rarer forms of halo.\r\n\r\nThe _upper_ and _lower tangent arcs of the halo of 22 degrees_, _c_ and\r\n_d_, undergo striking alterations, with changes in the altitude of the\r\nsun. When the luminary is more than about 40 degrees above the horizon,\r\nthese two arcs become joined at their tips to form the _circumscribed\r\nhalo_, and at still greater solar altitudes this halo contracts from an\r\nelliptical to a circular form, thus blending into the 22-degree halo\r\nas shown on the next page, where the solar altitudes corresponding to\r\nthe different forms of the halo are indicated. The positions of the\r\nparhelia of 22 degrees, _e, e′_, also depend upon solar altitude. When\r\nthe sun is on the horizon these “sun dogs” are 22 degrees from the\r\nluminary, and therefore lie in the 22-degree halo; at greater solar\r\naltitudes they lie outside this halo.\r\n\r\nThe reader who wishes to acquaint himself further with the\r\ndifferent forms of halo and the methods of observing them will find\r\na comprehensive article on the subject (devoid of mathematical\r\ndiscussions) in the “Monthly Weather Review” (Washington, D. C.) for\r\nJuly, 1914.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF THE UPPER AND LOWER TANGENT ARCS OF\r\nTHE 22° HALO\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is high they unite to form the “circumscribed halo.”\r\n(Altitude of sun shown in the center of each figure.)]\r\n\r\nThe ice crystals that produce halos consist of hexagonal plates or\r\ncolumns, occasionally including complications of structure, such as\r\npyramidal bases, combinations of plates and columns, etc. These have\r\nthe well-known effect of prisms in refracting and dispersing light\r\nthat passes through them. It is evident that there are many possible\r\npaths for the light rays through the sides and bases of such crystals,\r\nresulting in different deflections and corresponding differences in the\r\nforms and positions of the halos produced. The attitudes assumed by the\r\ncrystals as they slowly sink through the air, and the oscillations\r\nthey undergo, are further points to be considered in working out the\r\ntheory of each form of halo by the application of the laws of optics.\r\nNearly all the known forms have been fully explained. A few species of\r\nhalo--notably the parhelic circle (called _paraselenic circle_ when\r\nformed by the moon)--are due to simple reflection from the faces of the\r\nice crystals, and not to refraction.\r\n\r\nThe last group of optical phenomena that we shall consider consists of\r\nthose due to the process called _diffraction_, which occurs when light\r\nis bent around objects in its path, instead of passing through them, as\r\nin refraction. The process involves separation of the prismatic colors.\r\nThe diffraction phenomena of the atmosphere are produced by the water\r\ndrops of clouds and fog, or sometimes by fine dust.\r\n\r\nEverybody is familiar with the nocturnal spectacle which Tennyson\r\ndescribes as\r\n\r\n  ... the tender amber round\r\n  Which the moon about her spreadeth,\r\n  Moving thro’ a fleecy night.\r\n\r\nThis diffuse reddish or rainbow-tinted circle is called a _corona_.\r\nIt occurs about the sun as well as the moon (though not easy to see\r\non account of the glaring brightness of the luminary), and also about\r\nstreet lamps and other terrestrial lights when viewed through a misty\r\natmosphere. Unlike the halos, it has no definite angular size. It is\r\nusually only a few degrees in radius. Small coronas are produced by\r\nlarge water drops and large coronas by small drops, while the largest\r\nof all coronas, known as _Bishop’s ring_, is due to exceedingly\r\nfine dust in the atmosphere, and has been seen after great volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nIn its commonest form the corona consists of a brownish-red ring,\r\nwhich, together with the bluish-white inner field between the ring\r\nand the luminary, forms the so-called _aureole_. If other colors are\r\ndistinguishable, they follow the brownish red of the aureole (in the\r\ndirection away from the luminary) in the order from violet to red; the\r\nreverse of the order seen in halos. Sometimes the sequence of colors is\r\nrepeated three or four times.\r\n\r\nPatches and fringes of iridescence are sometimes seen in the clouds at\r\na greater distance from the luminary than that of the ordinary corona.\r\nProbably they are fragments of coronas of unusual size produced by\r\nexceedingly fine cloud particles.\r\n\r\nSimilar in appearance to the corona is the _glory_; a series of\r\nconcentric colored rings seen around the shadow of the observer, or\r\nof his head only, cast upon a cloud or fog bank. Such a shadow, with\r\nor without the glory, constitutes the _specter of the Brocken_, often\r\nseen from mountain tops and from aircraft. The colored circles are\r\nsometimes called _Ulloa’s rings_, from the name of a Spanish _savant_\r\nwho observed the phenomenon among the mountains of South America in the\r\neighteenth century and has left us a vivid description of it.\r\n\r\nThe Brocken specter, though it owes its name to legends associated\r\nwith the famous German mountain where witches were once believed to\r\nassemble on Walpurgis Night, is actually less frequently witnessed\r\nthere than in many other parts of the world. Whenever the sun is low\r\non one side of a mountain and a wall of mist arises from a near-by\r\nvalley on the other, the mountaineer is likely to see his shadow upon\r\nthe mist. If the latter consists of fine droplets of approximately\r\nuniform size, the colored rings will probably appear, and occasionally\r\nthere is also a white fogbow outside of the glory. As all shadows cast\r\nby the sun taper rapidly (on account of the angular breadth of the\r\nsolar disk), a well-defined Brocken specter can never be more than a\r\nfew yards away from the observer. Its distance is, however, commonly\r\noverestimated--some observers have supposed it to be miles away!--and\r\nhence the erroneous idea prevails that the specters are of enormous\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nRarely from a favorable point of vantage on a mountain, and very\r\nfrequently from aircraft, the specter, instead of being seen on a\r\nvertical wall of mist when the sun is low, appears on a horizontal\r\nsheet of cloud below the observer when the sun is high. The aeronaut\r\nmay thus observe the complete outline of his balloon or aeroplane,\r\nencircled with the rainbow tints of the glory. During the World War the\r\nappearance of the luminous rings was likened to the emblem painted on\r\nthe wings of the Allied aeroplanes and was regarded by superstitious\r\naviators as an omen favorable to their cause.\r\n\r\nThe glory is due to the light that is reflected back to the observer\r\nafter penetrating the cloud or fog a little way and is diffracted by\r\nthe superficial layer of drops in emerging.\r\n\r\nThe Brocken specter and the glory have occasionally been photographed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC ACOUSTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThough air is but one of an unlimited number of elastic substances that\r\ntransmit sound, it is the one through which sounds ordinarily reach\r\nour ears. Hence the acoustic properties of the atmosphere are of great\r\ninterest to mankind.\r\n\r\nScience deals with several kinds of “waves,” and those of the\r\natmosphere that produce the sensation of sound are quite different\r\nfrom the waves of the sea. In quiet unconfined air sound travels in\r\nconcentric spherical waves, consisting of successive condensations\r\nand rarefactions of the medium. Sound is not transmitted through a\r\nvacuum. A familiar laboratory experiment is to install an electric bell\r\ninside the receiver of an air pump and notice the dying away of the\r\nsound as the air is exhausted. The colossal eruptions that astronomers\r\nwitness on the surface of the sun would probably be audible on earth if\r\ninterplanetary space were filled with air. In the rarefied air of high\r\nmountains the intensity of sounds is much reduced. Thus we are told\r\nthat on the top of Mont Blanc the report of a pistol sounds no louder\r\nthan that of a firecracker at sea level.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which sound travels through air depends upon the\r\ntemperature. At 32° F. (the freezing point) it is 1,087 feet per\r\nsecond, and at 68° F. it is 1,126 feet per second. The increase of\r\nspeed with increase of air temperature is very close to 2 feet per\r\ndegree Centigrade, or a little more than 1 foot per degree Fahrenheit.\r\nThe sounds of violent explosions travel considerably faster than\r\nordinary sounds near the place of explosion, but slow down to the\r\nnormal speed at greater distances. This is true of heavy claps of\r\nthunder. The effect is not important enough, however, to invalidate\r\nthe well-known rule that, if you count seconds between the flash and\r\nthe detonation and divide the result by 5, you get approximately the\r\ndistance of the source of sound in miles.\r\n\r\nSince the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the air,\r\ndifferences in the latter cause deviations of the paths of sound waves\r\nsimilar to the deviations which rays of light undergo on account of\r\ndifferences in the density of the air. Sound is also reflected by\r\nobstacles, in the same manner as light. Moreover, whereas light travels\r\ntoo swiftly to be affected by the wind, this is not true of sound. The\r\nlatter travels faster with the wind than against it, and sound waves\r\nare more or less broken up by the gusts and irregularities that are a\r\nfeature of most winds near the earth’s surface. For all these reasons\r\nthe acoustic qualities of the air are subject to marked variations, as\r\neverybody has observed.\r\n\r\nUnusual audibility of distant sounds is a popular prognostic of\r\nrain. The fact underlying this belief is that when the air is full\r\nof moisture it is likely to be of uniform temperature, and therefore\r\nfavorable for transmitting sound.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to assign any limit to the distance at which loud\r\nsounds may occasionally be heard. No fact of nature has yet, so far\r\nas we know, matched Emerson’s metaphor of the “shot heard round the\r\nworld,” but it is literally true that the sounds of eruption of\r\nKrakatoa, in August, 1883, were heard, like the roar of distant heavy\r\nguns, in the island of Rodriguez, in the Indian Ocean, 3,000 miles from\r\nthe volcano. Moreover, the atmospheric waves set up by this outburst\r\nactually made the circuit of the globe, not only once, but at least\r\nthree times, and the successive journeys were registered by barometers,\r\nif not detected by human ears. During the World War gun firing in\r\nFlanders was very commonly heard at places in England 140 to 150 miles\r\ndistant. Several observers also reported that pheasants appeared, from\r\ntheir disturbed behavior, to hear cannonading over the North Sea that\r\nwas beyond the range of the human ear.\r\n\r\nWriters have often commented on the fact that thunder cannot be heard\r\nso far as the sounds of artillery. It has been affirmed that 10 miles\r\nor thereabouts is its maximum range of audibility. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, thunder has occasionally been heard at much greater distances,\r\nup to 20 or 30 miles; but it remains true that the distance is always\r\nmuch less than that at which loud terrestrial sounds are audible. The\r\nreasons why this should be so are not far to seek. In the first place,\r\nthe intensity of a sound depends upon the density of the air in which\r\nit is generated, and not upon that of the air in which it is heard. The\r\nair, as we know, diminishes in density upward. Balloonists thousands\r\nof feet above the earth hear with remarkable clearness sounds from\r\nthe ground below, but people on the ground cannot hear similar sounds\r\nfrom the balloon. As thunder is mainly produced at the level of the\r\nclouds, it is subject to this peculiarity. Again, cannonading is heard\r\nat great distances only when the air is comparatively calm, and perhaps\r\nonly when it is arranged in well-defined horizontal layers of such a\r\ncharacter as to keep the sound from spreading far aloft. Very different\r\nconditions prevail during a thunderstorm; in fact the conditions are\r\nthen just such as would scatter and dissipate the sound waves. Lastly,\r\nthe noise of a cannon or the like comes from a single place and the\r\nenergy of the disturbance is concentrated to produce a single system of\r\nsound waves; while the disturbance due to lightning is spread over the\r\nlong path of the discharge.\r\n\r\nThe audibility of sounds at abnormally great distances is not usually\r\na matter of practical importance, but the converse phenomenon--the\r\nfailure of sounds to carry to normal distances--has been responsible\r\nfor a great number of marine disasters on such fog-ridden coasts as\r\nthose of the British Isles, eastern Canada and California. Hence some\r\nof the ablest physicists of both the Old World and the New have tried\r\nto ascertain the conditions under which this phenomenon occurs.\r\n\r\nThe scientific study of fog signals, dating especially from Tyndall’s\r\nwell-known investigations at the South Foreland, in England, in 1873,\r\nand those of General Duane and Professor Joseph Henry in America,\r\nbegun somewhat earlier but continued contemporaneously with Tyndall’s,\r\nhas probably raised more questions than it has answered. The caprices\r\nof these signals take the shape of variations in the range of\r\naudibility--a signal may at one time carry 10 miles and at another\r\nonly 2--and the formation of “zones of silence,” comparatively near\r\nthe signal, within which the sound is not heard though audible at\r\nmuch greater distances. The silent zones are sometimes more or less\r\npermanent and are then generally due to peculiarities of topography;\r\nbut in many cases they are transient and opinions differ as to their\r\ncause or causes. Since it is only when fog prevails that fog signals\r\nare sounded (except for experimental purposes), and that vessels meet\r\nwith accidents on account of the failure to hear such signals, the idea\r\nhas become rooted in the public mind that these acoustic eccentricities\r\nare entirely due to fog. When, however, experiments are made in clear\r\nweather, similar phenomena are observed.\r\n\r\nIn foggy weather audibility is often better than the average, because\r\nfog prevails chiefly when the air is still and of uniform temperature,\r\nand such conditions favor the transmission of sound. Tyndall strongly\r\ndenied that either fog or falling rain, snow, and hail have, as has\r\nbeen commonly believed, a muffling effect on sound, and he attributed\r\nthe peculiar behavior of fog signals to the presence in the atmosphere\r\nof invisible “acoustic clouds,” consisting of patches of air containing\r\nirregularities of temperature and humidity. To the same cause he\r\nascribed the occurrence of mysterious “aerial echoes,” not due to\r\nany visible object. Several recent investigators have disputed these\r\nconclusions. Thus it is asserted that when the fog signal is in fog\r\nand the observer in a clear atmosphere, or _vice versa_, or when the\r\nsignal and the observer are in different fog banks, the fog reflects\r\nthe sound very strongly. Apart from the possible effects of fog itself,\r\nthe very extensive investigations made by Prof. L. V. King, of McGill\r\nUniversity, at Father Point, Quebec, led him to conclude that the\r\neffects are chiefly due to eddies in the atmosphere. Prof. King used in\r\nhis observations the latest devices for obtaining exact measurements\r\nof sound and such up-to-date meteorological apparatus as pilot balloons\r\nfor measuring the wind at various levels. He discovered, among other\r\nthings, that existing types of fog-signal machinery are very wasteful\r\nof energy, and he has pointed out how their “acoustic efficiency” may\r\nbe much improved. Before we dismiss this subject it should be noted\r\nthat submarine bells and the radio compass have made mariners much less\r\ndependent than they formerly were upon the types of signals that are\r\naffected by meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\n“Zones of silence” on a much more extensive scale than those that\r\ndisturb the operation of fog signals have been frequently observed, in\r\nrecent years, in connection with great explosions, cannonading, and\r\nvolcanic eruptions. The first case of this kind to attract scientific\r\nnotice was that of a dynamite explosion at Förde, Westphalia, on\r\nDecember 14, 1903, the acoustic phenomena of which were investigated\r\nby Dr. G. von dem Borne; and among the many cases that have since\r\nbeen studied was that of the bombardment of Antwerp in October, 1914.\r\nWithout describing these various cases separately, we may state that\r\nwhen reports were collected from the surrounding country to determine\r\nthe places at which the sounds were audible and these reports were\r\nentered on a map, it was found that there was a large and usually\r\nvery irregular area of audibility surrounding the source of sound,\r\nbeyond which lay a broad, more or less circular zone of inaudibility,\r\nand finally, beginning about 100 miles from the source, there was a\r\nsecond large region of audibility, extending perhaps 150 miles from\r\nthe source. In some cases a single sound at the source gave multiple\r\nreports (double, triple, or quadruple), chiefly in the outer zone of\r\naudibility.\r\n\r\nIn his attempt to explain these curious silent zones, Von dem Borne\r\npointed out that the atmosphere at very high levels is supposed to\r\nconsist mainly of hydrogen, in which sound travels nearly four times\r\nas fast as in the common gases of the lower air, and that sound\r\nwaves ascending to such heights along a slanting course would be\r\nbent strongly toward the earth. Another student of this phenomenon,\r\nDr. A. Wegener, who is the champion of the idea that the atmosphere\r\ncontains an unknown gas lighter than hydrogen (called “geocoronium”\r\nor “zodiacon”), sees in the prevalence of this gas at high levels\r\nthe cause of a similar quasi-reflection of sound waves. Probably the\r\nmajority of investigators, however, believe that the effect is due\r\nchiefly or entirely to the refraction of sound by wind.\r\n\r\nOf acoustic phenomena that belong especially to the domain of\r\nmeteorology, probably thunder is the one that excites most general\r\ninterest. The sudden expansion of the air along the path of a lightning\r\ndischarge, due partly but probably not entirely to the heat generated,\r\nappears to be an adequate explanation of the explosive sound of\r\nthunder, though somewhat different explanations have been suggested. If\r\nthe discharge is near at hand, we generally hear a single loud crash.\r\nMore distant lightning is usually attended by rumbling. The common and\r\nobvious explanation of rumbling is that it is due to the arrival of the\r\nsound progressively from different points along the path of discharge,\r\nwhich may be a mile or more in length. A crooked path would account\r\nfor reenforcements and diminutions of the sound. Another cause of\r\nirregularities in the sound is probably “interference” (combinations\r\nof waves that tend either to strengthen or to neutralize each other),\r\nespecially in the case of multiple lightning discharges, such as we\r\nhave described elsewhere. Lastly, thunder is further complicated by\r\nechoes from the ground and probably also from the air (not exclusively\r\nfrom clouds), though much uncertainty prevails concerning these aerial\r\nechoes. The sounds of thunder have been the subject of some interesting\r\ninvestigations on the part of an Austrian meteorologist, Dr. Wilhelm\r\nSchmidt, who has devised apparatus for making an automatic registration\r\nof the sound waves that constitute a thunderclap. He finds that there\r\nis a great preponderance of waves of very long period, including many\r\nof too low a pitch to be audible, though perceptible through the\r\nrattling of windowpanes, etc. In fact, the greater part of the energy\r\ninvolved is represented by these long, inaudible waves, so that one\r\nreally _hears_ only a small part of a clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nThe statement has often been made, on the authority of Humboldt, that\r\nthunder is never heard at sea, at any point far from land. This matter\r\nwas investigated by the magnetic survey yacht _Carnegie_ during a long\r\ncruise in the Pacific in 1915. Of twenty-two displays of lightning, six\r\nwere accompanied by thunder.\r\n\r\nThe late war gave prominence to certain acoustic phenomena which,\r\nthough hardly mysterious, were novel to the world at large. One of\r\nthose was the double report (triple in the case of an exploding shell)\r\nheard near the line of fire of large guns. This effect is due to the\r\nfact that modern projectiles travel much faster than sound. The moving\r\nprojectile sets up its own waves in the air, like those at the bow\r\nof a steamer, which may reach the ear of the observer and produce the\r\nsensation of a sharp sound before he hears the sound coming from the\r\nmouth of the gun. Another phenomenon frequently observed when heavy\r\nfiring was in progress was the appearance in the sky of rapidly moving\r\nparallel arcs of light and shade. These were generally seen against\r\nclouds, but sometimes they swept across blue sky. They probably\r\noccurred only in calm weather. These arcs were the result of the\r\nsuccessive condensations and rarefactions of the air constituting waves\r\nof sound--visible sound waves. Their visibility was due to contrasts in\r\nthe refraction of light passing through air of different densities; the\r\nsame sort of refraction contrasts that cause the tremulous appearance\r\nof the air over a hot stove, for example. The same “flashing arcs” of\r\nlight have been described by Prof. F. A. Perret as attending explosive\r\nvolcanic outbursts at the craters of Vesuvius and Ætna.\r\n\r\nThe humming of telegraph wires has been the subject of a certain\r\namount of discussion in meteorological circles, but without altogether\r\nsatisfactory results. This sound is not, of course, caused or affected\r\nby the electric currents passing along the wire, and it is almost\r\ncertainly due solely to the wind, though the suggestion has been\r\nmade that it might be caused by the microseisms, or small and rapid\r\nearthquake tremors, that are so commonly registered by seismographs\r\nwhile imperceptible to the human senses. The humming is best heard\r\nwhen one’s ear is placed against a telegraph pole. Several persons\r\nhave made systematic observations of these sounds from day to day,\r\nand it has often been alleged that they vary with the temperature,\r\nthe movements of storms, etc., and even constitute a safe basis for\r\nweather predictions. They are sometimes heard when the air appears to\r\nbe perfectly calm, but in such cases there might be some movement of\r\nthe air at the level of the wires, though there was none at the lower\r\nlevel of the observer. From what is known about “æolian tones” (such\r\nas those of the æolian harp), it would seem that the humming requires\r\na wind more or less at right angles to the wire, and that the pitch of\r\nthe sound depends upon the force of the wind and the diameter (but not\r\nthe length or tension) of the wire. For a given wire, the stronger the\r\nwind the higher the pitch of its sound.\r\n\r\nOf all the sounds that haunt the air, probably the most mysterious are\r\nthose which are best called by the generic name “brontides” (coined,\r\nin the Italian form _brontidi_, by Prof. Tito Alippi from two Greek\r\nwords meaning “like thunder”), though they rejoice in scores of other\r\nnames in various parts of the world. Brontides take the form of\r\nmuffled detonations, resembling the sound of distant cannon or peals\r\nof thunder, and are heard chiefly in warm, clear weather. The first\r\nsystematic investigations of these phenomena were made in India. The\r\nfact that they were frequently reported from the neighborhood of\r\nBarisal, a town in the Ganges delta, led to their being called “Barisal\r\nguns,” under which name they were first made known to European science\r\nin 1890. A few years later they were discussed in an extensive memoir\r\nby E. van den Broeck, who had collected numerous reports of their\r\noccurrence in Belgium, especially on the seacoast, where they are\r\nknown as “mistpoeffers” (i. e., “fog belchings” or “fog hiccups”).\r\nThe majority of descriptions, however, have come from Italy, where\r\nthe sounds appear to be extremely common, though peculiar to certain\r\nlocalities, and where they bear a great variety of names. In Australia\r\nthe noises are called “desert sounds,” in Haiti, “gouffre,” etc.\r\nThey have been reported from parts of the United States, including\r\nCalifornia and, above all, from the vicinity of Moodus, Conn., which\r\nowes its original Indian name, Morehemoodus (“place of noises”), to the\r\nbrontides which appear to have formerly been much more common there\r\nthan they are to-day. There is a reference in one of Lord Bacon’s\r\nworks to “an extraordinary noise in the sky when there is no thunder”;\r\napparently a description of brontides.\r\n\r\nThe source of these sounds is undoubtedly subterranean in a great\r\nmany cases, though perhaps not in all. Prof. W. H. Hobbs, who has\r\nmade a painstaking study of the seismic geology of Italy, concludes\r\nthat the brontides of that country are due to the slow settling of\r\nthe blocks of the earth’s crust; a process which, in its more abrupt\r\nand violent phases, causes definite earthquakes. Alippi believes that\r\nin order that the sounds may be heard they must be reenforced by a\r\npeculiar configuration of the ground, above or below the surface, and\r\nhe attaches special importance to the effects of caverns, which he\r\nsuggests act as resonance boxes in the production of audible brontides.\r\nOccasionally an apparent brontide may be due to the explosion of an\r\nunseen meteor. Lastly, a certain proportion of these thunderlike\r\nsounds, if not merely distant thunder, may be such noises as\r\ncannonading, blasting, or the like, made audible at unusual distances\r\nby the refraction of sound waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND CLIMATES\r\n\r\n\r\nSome day the meteorologists of the world will join forces to produce\r\na great encyclopædia of climate. No work of science is more sorely\r\nneeded, but the magnitude that it would, ideally, assume is simply\r\nstaggering.\r\n\r\nFew people realize the multiplicity and complexity of climates. It\r\nis a common occurrence for a prospective traveler or a business man\r\nto write to a meteorological establishment requesting, for example,\r\na description of the climate of South America. Of course, no such\r\nthing exists. A continent does not have a climate, but a multitude\r\nof climates. Even to set forth, in general terms, the more important\r\ntypes of climate that prevail between Cape Horn and Panama is no small\r\nundertaking. Moreover, general descriptions often fail to supply the\r\nneeds of those who make inquiries about climate.\r\n\r\nSuppose, instead of the wholesale order above mentioned, the\r\nmeteorologist receives the relatively modest request to describe\r\nthe climate of Buenos Aires or Rio de Janeiro. Is it easy to comply\r\nwith such a request? That depends. If the information is sought by\r\na tourist who wishes chiefly to know whether he will need light or\r\nheavy clothing at a specified season, or whether his excursions are\r\nlikely to be hampered by frequent rains, we can enlighten him in a\r\nfew brief paragraphs. If the inquiry comes from a manufacturer who\r\naspires to invade the South American markets, we must know, before\r\nreplying, what kind of goods he purposes to export, and just how they\r\nare affected by climatic conditions. Are they liable to injury by high\r\nor low temperatures, dryness or humidity? Does the demand for them\r\ndepend, as in the case of rubber coats, upon the prevalence of rain,\r\nor, as in the case of electric fans, upon the occurrence of hot weather\r\nduring at least a part of the year? For each branch of the export trade\r\ncertain elements of climate are important, and the more detailed and\r\nexplicit the information that can be obtained about them the better.\r\nSuppose, again, climatic data are desired by a horticulturist who has\r\nto solve the problem of introducing a South American plant into the\r\nUnited States. In order to find the best environment for it in this\r\ncountry, he should know something about the climate of its original\r\nhome. The data he requires are, however, different from those sought by\r\nthe tourist or the manufacturer. Is the plant’s habitat a region where\r\nfrosts occur? How long is the growing season? Is the rainfall rather\r\nevenly distributed over the year, or are there definite dry and rainy\r\nseasons? Such are some of the questions he will ask. For the purposes\r\nof medical climatology a different set of data will be sought. The\r\nastronomer, selecting a site for a new observatory, will ask about\r\nfreedom from clouds, and also about the pureness and steadiness of the\r\nair that insure good “seeing.” The aviator will want information about\r\nwinds and fog. And so on.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that climate means very different things to different\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nClimate has been variously defined as the sum total of weather, average\r\nweather, typical weather, etc., but the conception is still somewhat\r\nindefinite. We know that, while the weather of any place is subject\r\nto incessant changes, its climate persists; but we need not assume\r\nthat it persists indefinitely. The geological record proves, on the\r\ncontrary, that vast changes of climate have occurred in the course of\r\nlong ages. In Antarctica and in Spitzbergen are found deposits of coal,\r\nconstituting the débris of ancient forests such as could not exist in\r\nthe climates now prevailing in those regions. There are plenty of other\r\nproofs that great climatic changes have taken place from one geological\r\nperiod to another; but what of changes in shorter intervals of time?\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of zeal and energy has been devoted to the study of\r\nsupposed changes of climate. Evidence of such changes is sought, on the\r\none hand, in a painstaking examination of weather records (a process\r\noften involving the tabulation of hundreds of thousands of figures),\r\nand, on the other, in the collection of geographical and historical\r\ndata bearing on the question. There have been numerous reports of the\r\ngradual drying up of African and Asiatic lakes, of the discovery of\r\nancient ruins indicating that prosperous agricultural communities once\r\nflourished in regions that are now deserts, and of various other tokens\r\nthat marked vicissitudes of climate have occurred within historic\r\ntimes. A recent ingenious method of studying climatic variations is\r\nto measure the successive annual rings seen in cross sections of old\r\ntrees. Thick rings are supposed to have been formed during periods of\r\nabundant rainfall, and thin rings when the rainfall was deficient. This\r\nmethod has been applied to the giant _Sequoias_ of California, some of\r\nwhich are more than 3,000 years old.\r\n\r\nThe net result of a wide range of investigations appears to be that,\r\non the whole, climate has everywhere been remarkably constant since\r\nthe dawn of human history. There is much evidence that, in certain\r\nregions, there have been alternate increases and decreases--recurrent\r\noscillations--of temperature, rainfall, etc., but there is little\r\nevidence of progressive changes in one direction.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the uncertainty that still prevails in the scientific\r\nworld on the subject of climatic changes is the confidence with which\r\nthe average layman may be heard to assert that such changes have taken\r\nplace within his own recollection. The popular idea that climate has\r\nchanged perceptibly within a single human lifetime is a world-wide\r\ndelusion, and one that has, apparently, always flourished. In the\r\nUnited States we hear of the “old-fashioned winter,” with its unlimited\r\nsleighing, and also of a marked increase or falling off in the rainfall\r\nin certain districts. It is an interesting fact that a century and more\r\nago Americans were indulging in the same sort of retrospections.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1770, when Benjamin Franklin was president of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society of Philadelphia, a paper was read before that\r\nsociety entitled: “An Attempt to account for the Change of Climate\r\nwhich has been Observed in the Middle Colonies of North America.” It is\r\npublished in the first volume of the society’s Transactions. Barring\r\nthe long _s_’s and the use of the word “colonies,” the greater part of\r\nit might have been addressed to the owners of automobiles and Liberty\r\nbonds. We are told of a “very observable change of climate,” remarked\r\nby everybody who has resided long in Pennsylvania and the neighboring\r\ncolonies. “Our winters,” says the author, “are not so intensely cold,\r\nnor are our summers so disagreeably warm as they have been.” These\r\nchanges he ascribes to the clearing and cultivation of the country.\r\n\r\nAnother firm believer in old-fashioned winters and old-fashioned\r\nsummers was Thomas Jefferson. In his “Notes on Virginia,” written in\r\n1781, he says:\r\n\r\n“A change in our climate is taking place very sensibly. Both heats and\r\ncolds are become much more moderate, within the memory even of the\r\nmiddle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep. They do not often\r\nlie, below the mountains, more than one, two or three days, and very\r\nrarely a week. They are remembered to have been formerly frequent,\r\ndeep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me, the earth used to\r\nbe covered with snow about three months in every winter.”\r\n\r\nSamuel Williams, who published a “History of Vermont” in 1794, uses\r\nalmost identical language in reference to the climate of that State.\r\n“Snows,” he says, “are neither so frequent, deep, or of so long\r\ncontinuance as they were formerly; and they are yet declining very fast\r\nin their number, quantity, and duration.” That these changes, he adds,\r\n“are much connected with and greatly accelerated by the cultivation of\r\nthe country cannot be doubted.”\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? When the statements above quoted were written few\r\nregular records of the weather had been maintained for any length of\r\ntime in this country. The earliest instrumental record was begun at\r\nCharleston, S. C., in 1730. Much information was, however, available\r\nconcerning the dates of harvest, of the formation and breaking up\r\nof ice in rivers and harbors, and other events dependent upon the\r\nweather, which, if anybody had taken the trouble to collect and analyze\r\nit, would have dispelled the universal belief that marked changes of\r\nclimate had recently taken place. Nowadays it is much easier to refute\r\nthe common assertion that the climate has changed within the memory\r\nof living men. The meteorological history of our country for more\r\nthan three-quarters of a century has been recorded from day to day by\r\na host of careful observers in every State of the Union. The records\r\nshow that, while the weather of one year has often differed strikingly\r\nfrom that of the next, there has been no real change in climate.\r\n“Old-fashioned” winters, for example, were neither more nor less common\r\nhalf a century ago than they are to-day.\r\n\r\nOur memories of past weather mislead us, chiefly because we remember\r\nthe exceptional weather and forget that which commonly prevailed.\r\nOther circumstances may contribute to the illusion. Thus many people\r\nwho now live in cities, where modern appliances make them more or less\r\nindependent of the weather, passed their childhood under the more\r\nprimitive conditions of the country.\r\n\r\nIf climates were not fairly constant for long periods of years, it\r\nwould be a waste of time to compile the climatic statistics that, as\r\nwe have seen, are wanted by so many different kinds of people for so\r\nmany different purposes. Such statistics are based upon past events,\r\nbut their practical value depends upon the fact that, within certain\r\nlimits, they are a safe guide to the future.\r\n\r\nThe climatic data for any place are a sort of digest of the\r\nmeteorological observations that have been made there, special\r\nemphasis being given to those features of the meteorological record\r\nthat bear important relations to the life and activities of mankind.\r\nTemperature and rainfall are the leading elements of climate; others\r\nare wind, humidity, evaporation, cloudiness, etc. We have not space\r\nto enumerate here all the kinds of data found in elaborate climatic\r\ntables; but in order to illustrate how the records of a meteorological\r\nstation are utilized in compiling climatic statistics and to show what\r\ncomplications may arise in this process, we shall consider the question\r\nof temperature alone.\r\n\r\nThe instruments used in measuring temperature have been described\r\nin another chapter. From these instruments are obtained the current\r\ntemperature of the air, the wet bulb temperature (used to compute\r\nthe humidity), and the maximum and minimum temperatures of the day.\r\nReadings are made at fixed hours, known as “term hours.” At regular\r\nstations of the United States Weather Bureau the term hours for the\r\nobservation of all the meteorological elements are 8 a. m. and 8\r\np. m., Eastern Time, and an observation of temperature, humidity, and\r\nclouds is made at noon. In most other countries tri-daily readings\r\nhave been the rule, though in Europe four or more observations a\r\nday are now taken at many stations in order to supply the frequent\r\nweather bulletins required by aeronauts. Important stations are\r\ngenerally equipped with thermographs, which make a continuous record of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the mean temperature of any day is the average of 24\r\nhourly observations, from midnight to midnight. In practice, the mean\r\nis generally computed from the observations at the term hours, or from\r\nthe maximum and minimum. Having obtained the mean daily temperature\r\nfor each day of a month, the average of these values gives us the\r\nmean monthly temperature. The average of the mean temperatures for the\r\ntwelve months of the year is the mean annual temperature.\r\n\r\nThese data for each day and month, and for the year--sometimes also for\r\nother intervals, such as five-day periods, or “pentads,”--are computed\r\nyear after year, and eventually the values for all the years of the\r\nrecord are averaged to form what are called “normals.” We thus obtain,\r\nfor example, for a given station, the normal temperature for January\r\n21, the normal temperature for the month of March, the normal annual\r\ntemperature, etc.\r\n\r\nAll this is a mere beginning toward the complete discussion of a\r\nbody of temperature observations for the purposes of climatology. We\r\nhave still to obtain from the readings of the maximum and minimum\r\nthermometers the normal maximum and minimum temperatures and range\r\nof temperature for each day, each month, and the year; also the\r\n“absolute” maxima, minima, and ranges (i. e., the extreme values that\r\nhave occurred during the entire record) for corresponding intervals of\r\ntime. These data furnish answers to such questions as: What was the\r\nlowest temperature ever recorded on January 21? What is the lowest on\r\nan _average_ January 21? What is the average range of temperature in\r\nMarch? What was the highest temperature ever recorded, on any day, at\r\nthe station?\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of the extremes and ranges, we may compute\r\nwhat is called the “variability” of temperature, i. e., the average\r\ndifference between the means of two successive days in a given month,\r\nand the corresponding average for the entire year. These data are of\r\nconsiderable importance in medical climatology. We may also compute\r\nthe frequency of occurrence of various values among the temperature\r\ndata above enumerated. The most frequent value is often quite different\r\nfrom the average value. Many climatologists compute the number of\r\ndays, in an average year, on which the temperature rises to 77 degrees\r\n(Fahr.) or above (“summer-days”), and the number of days on which the\r\ntemperature does not rise above the freezing point (“winter-days”).\r\nEspecially valuable in agricultural regions are data of the average\r\nand extreme dates of the last frost in spring and of the first frost\r\nin autumn. These define the length of the “growing season.” Statistics\r\nof the temperature of the ground at the surface and at various depths\r\nbelow the surface are also of agricultural interest.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing outline it will be seen that a bewildering variety\r\nof climatic statistics may be computed merely from observations of\r\ntemperature, and the same is true of the other elements. Moreover, the\r\nlist set forth above is by no means exhaustive even for temperature.\r\nIn fact, there is almost no limit to the number of ways in which\r\nthe raw material of climatic data--i. e., the original records of\r\nobservation--may be grouped, averaged, or otherwise treated in order to\r\nbring out certain features of the climate that may conceivably serve\r\nsome useful purpose. The reader will now be able to understand why a\r\ntreatise on the climate of a single locality often fills a substantial\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThe numerical data contained in such a work are generally supplemented\r\nby text descriptions and by various graphic devices, such as curves\r\nshowing the normal fluctuation or “march” of a weather element during\r\na day, year, or other interval. Works which deal with the climates\r\nof larger areas, such as whole countries, are usually accompanied by\r\nclimatic charts. These charts furnish a quick and easy way of getting\r\na general idea of the climate of a region. Among the more important\r\nclimatic charts are the following:\r\n\r\n1. _Temperature (isothermal) charts._ These include charts showing\r\nthe distribution of normal temperatures for months, seasons, and the\r\nyear; normal range of temperature for similar periods; highest and\r\nlowest temperatures ever recorded at the different stations; etc. Lines\r\nknown as _isotherms_ are so drawn as to pass through places having\r\nidentical values of the element in question (mean temperature, highest\r\ntemperature, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. _Rainfall (isohyetal) charts._ These show the distribution of\r\nrainfall (including snowfall, expressed in equivalent depth of water);\r\nespecially for each month and for the year. Other charts may show the\r\naverage number of rainy days; average snowfall (actual depth, not water\r\nequivalent); seasonal distribution of rainfall; etc.\r\n\r\n3. _Wind charts._ These are drawn in various forms, to show the\r\nprevailing wind directions, the frequency of winds from different\r\ndirections, the average force of the winds, etc. Charts of the winds at\r\ndifferent levels above the earth’s surface will eventually be drawn for\r\nthe use of aeronauts, but such charts are still in a tentative stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODERN ISOTHERMAL CHART OF THE GLOBE. (_Hann, 1901_)\r\nThe isotherms show the mean annual temperature in centigrade degrees.]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of tabulated climatic data, the number of charts\r\nthat might be drawn to bring out different features of climate is\r\npractically unlimited. Sunshine, cloudiness, humidity, barometric\r\npressure, and the frequency of various special phenomena, such as\r\nthunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, droughts, etc., are all charted in\r\nsome of the more extensive works on climate. Large atlases have been\r\npublished to portray the climates of certain countries. The study of\r\nthe actual distribution of climates over the earth, as distinguished\r\nfrom that of climate in general, is sometimes called _climatography_.\r\n\r\nClimates are variously classified, usually on the basis of one or\r\nmore of the climatic elements, but sometimes with reference to their\r\neffects. The most familiar classifications refer to temperature. We\r\nspeak of tropical, temperate, and polar climates; but in using these\r\nterms it should not be forgotten that other things besides latitude\r\ncontrol the distribution of temperature. Location with respect to the\r\nocean or other large bodies of water is almost equally important. A\r\nland surface grows warm by day and in summer, and grows cold by night\r\nand in winter, much more rapidly than a water surface, and the adjacent\r\nair varies in temperature accordingly. Hence we have a classification\r\nof climates as _marine_ and _continental_. The former, under the\r\ninfluence of oceanic winds, have a moderate range of temperature, while\r\nthe latter are subject to extremes of heat and cold. With increase\r\nof altitude temperature is diminished, but rainfall is generally\r\nincreased. The distribution of rainfall is also determined to a great\r\nextent by the paths of cyclonic storms. Such are a few of the many\r\nthings that control the complex distribution of climates.\r\n\r\nPeople who never travel far from their own homes usually cherish quite\r\nerroneous ideas regarding the climates of distant lands. It is hard for\r\nmost Americans to realize, for example, that the Isthmus of Panama,\r\nin the heart of the tropics, never experiences temperatures nearly so\r\nhigh as those which occur every summer in the United States. A citizen\r\nof South Dakota, where the mercury, in the shade, frequently rises\r\nabove 100° Fahr., and has been known to reach 115°, will be inclined\r\nto revise his definition of the term “tropical” when he learns that\r\nat Colon, the Atlantic terminus of the Canal, a temperature as high\r\nas 90° is decidedly exceptional, and that the maximum reading during\r\na period of six years was only 92°. In thirteen years Canal Zone\r\nvital statistics showed only two deaths from sunstroke and twenty-one\r\nnon-fatal cases of heat prostration among a population of 120,000. It\r\nwill also surprise most Americans to learn that the highest natural\r\nair temperatures that have been recorded anywhere on earth were not\r\nobserved near the equator, but in a California desert. At a place on\r\nthe edge of Death Valley, rejoicing in the ironical name of Greenland\r\nRanch, a temperature of 134° Fahr. was registered in July, 1913. The\r\nthermometer which furnished this remarkable reading was a tested\r\ninstrument, installed in a standard screen over an alfalfa sod, and\r\nnot exposed to the reflected heat of the desert. At the same place the\r\ntemperature reached 100° or more on 548 days in four years. Outside\r\nof the United States the highest temperature ever recorded at a\r\nmeteorological station was 127° Fahr. at Wargla (Ouargla), Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe lowest temperatures encountered by polar explorers are considerably\r\nhigher than those experienced each winter by the inhabitants of\r\nnorthern Siberia. The “record,” so far as instrumental observations go,\r\nis held by the town of Verkhoyansk, at which the temperature fell to\r\n90° below zero (Fahrenheit) in February, 1892. Strange to say, this\r\n“winter cold pole” of the earth has warm summers. At Verkhoyansk the\r\ntemperature sometimes rises to 80° above zero, or higher. At Yakutsk,\r\nSiberia, the thermometer has been known to fall to 84° below zero in\r\nwinter and to rise 102° above zero in summer; a range of temperature\r\nexceeding the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point\r\nof water!\r\n\r\nAnother climatic paradox is that experienced by mountaineers who, in\r\nscaling peaks mantled in eternal snow, often suffer with the heat,\r\non account of the intensity of solar radiation in the pure, dry air\r\nof high altitudes. At the health resort of Davos, in the high Alps\r\n(altitude 5,250 feet), invalids sit out-of-doors without wraps in\r\nmidwinter, and, indeed, are sometimes driven into the shade to escape\r\nthe too ardent rays of the sun. At the same time the temperature of the\r\nair itself may be far below freezing, and the ground covered with snow.\r\n\r\nCertain parts of the world are often loosely described as “rainless,”\r\nbut, as we have stated elsewhere, there is actually no spot on earth\r\nat which rain (or snow, in the polar regions) has never been known to\r\nfall. In the driest part of the Sahara--the Libyan Desert, between\r\nDakhel and Kufra--the explorer Rohlfs experienced a drenching rainstorm\r\nof three days’ duration in 1874. Neither is the Sahara, in spite of its\r\nproverbial heat, exempt from touches of real winter. Snow is a common\r\noccurrence in many parts of this desert, even at moderate altitudes.\r\nOn the higher Saharan peaks snow lies on the ground all winter, and\r\nis sometimes found, in sheltered spots, in summer. Occasional falls\r\nof snow occur in all parts of Algeria, and several falls have been\r\nrecorded in Lower Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the whole fabric of what now constitutes\r\nthe science of climatology leaves much to be desired. Climate is\r\nof practical interest, first of all, on account of its effects\r\non human life and health, and secondly because of its influence\r\nupon the crops that are the mainstay of man’s material prosperity.\r\nUnder both these heads climatic data, as now commonly presented,\r\nignore certain atmospheric activities of the utmost importance. For\r\nbiological purposes no description of a climate can be regarded as even\r\napproximately complete that does not furnish, for the region under\r\ndiscussion, a detailed account of the different kinds of radiation\r\nreceived from the sun, their intensities and fluctuations; and there\r\nare few places in the world at which even a beginning has been made\r\nin the collection of such data. Again, the phenomena of atmospheric\r\nelectricity, including radioactivity, are probably of real climatic\r\nsignificance, but we are still in the stage of speculation with regard\r\nto this subject. Possibly there are still other elements of climate,\r\nnow wholly neglected, that will figure prominently in the climatology\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nORGANIZED METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other branch of science is so dependent upon the constant systematic\r\ncooperation of a multitude of workers as meteorology. There are, to\r\nbe sure, some kinds of atmospheric phenomena that can be studied\r\nadvantageously by the individual meteorologist, with no further aid\r\nfrom his scientific confrères than the same sort of interchange of\r\nideas that prevails in all departments of knowledge; but the widespread\r\nprocesses that constitute weather and climate require for their\r\nobservation--whether the purpose in view be weather forecasting, or\r\nthe collection of climatic statistics, or the assembling of data from\r\nwhich to deduce the laws of atmospheric movements--a veritable army of\r\ncolaborers, equipped with standardized instruments and keeping their\r\nrecords according to a uniform plan.\r\n\r\nProbably few people, in looking at the charts portraying the climates\r\nof the world that are found in reference books, realize how many\r\nobservers have contributed to the preparation of such charts or the\r\nnumber of separate instrumental observations upon which they are\r\nbased. In the United States alone there are something like 6,000\r\nmeteorological stations, at which upward of two and a quarter million\r\nobservations are made every year--and a climatic chart is, of course,\r\nthe fruit of _many_ years of observations. At the beginning of the\r\npresent century it was estimated that there were 31,000 meteorological\r\nstations in operation throughout the world. The present number is\r\ndoubtless much greater. At some of these stations observations have\r\nbeen made regularly, once, twice or three times a day, for 100 or 150\r\nyears. In round numbers one may say that, during the last few decades,\r\nmeteorological observations have been made, the world over, at the\r\nrate of ten million a year, and the total number, since the keeping of\r\nregular weather records began, runs far up in the hundred millions.\r\n\r\nOrganized meteorological observations were not unknown to antiquity--we\r\nhave mentioned elsewhere the early rainfall measurements in India and\r\nPalestine--but the present era of such undertakings dates back only\r\nto the middle of the seventeenth century. In the year 1654 the Grand\r\nDuke Ferdinand II of Tuscany, through his chaplain and secretary,\r\nLuigi Antinori, secured the cooperation of several observers in Italy\r\nand the adjacent countries, to whom were distributed instruments and\r\nforms for maintaining daily records of the principal meteorological\r\nelements. Antinori and most of the observers belonged to the Jesuits,\r\nan order which has displayed extraordinary zeal in the furtherance of\r\nmeteorology down to the present day. The observations thus inaugurated\r\nappear to have been kept up until about 1667, but unfortunately few\r\nof the records have been preserved. Several undertakings of similar\r\ncharacter were launched during the next hundred years in France,\r\nEngland, and Germany. The most notable of such enterprises, however,\r\nantedating the foundation of the present official weather services,\r\nwas the international system of observations maintained by the\r\nMeteorological Society of the Palatinate, founded at Mannheim in\r\n1780 under the auspices of the Elector Karl Theodor. The chief credit\r\nfor the epoch-making work of this society is due to its secretary,\r\nJ. J. Hemmer. The society distributed standard instruments to its\r\nobservers, who were widely scattered over the world; viz., fourteen in\r\nGermany, two in Austria-Hungary, two in Switzerland, four in Italy,\r\nthree in France, four in Belgium and Holland, three in Russia, four in\r\nScandinavia, one in Greenland, and two in North America (at Bradford\r\nand Cambridge, Mass.). The very detailed observations of this network\r\nof stations down to the year 1792 were published in twelve large\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the activities of the Mannheim society came to an end in\r\nthe troublous days of the French Revolution, the records that it had\r\ncollected served as the groundwork for fruitful studies during the next\r\ngeneration. There are two distinct uses that can be made of statistics\r\nof this sort. First, they can be digested in such a way as to bring out\r\nthe characteristic features of the climate at each of the localities\r\nincluded in the collection, and likewise to illustrate the distribution\r\nof climates over the globe. Second, the data for individual days from\r\nthe various stations can be charted separately, so as to illustrate the\r\n_instantaneous_ distribution of barometric pressure, wind and weather,\r\nand, by a comparison of the charts for successive days, to provide a\r\nsort of moving picture of the atmospheric machinery in operation.\r\n\r\nCharts based on approximately simultaneous observations showing\r\nthe state of the atmosphere at a particular moment of time over an\r\nextensive area of the earth are called _synchronous charts_, or\r\nsometimes _synoptic charts_, though the latter term is also applicable\r\nto charts showing average values for a particular month, year, etc.\r\nSynchronous charts, as used nowadays for the purpose of making\r\nforecasts, are prepared from data collected by telegraph; but the\r\nsame kind of charts can be prepared in a more leisurely manner from\r\nthe statistics gathered at any previous time, and such charts were\r\nfrequently made for the purpose of study before the days of telegraphy.\r\nThe pioneer in such undertakings was the German physicist, H. W.\r\nBrandes, who, about 1820, utilized the observations collected by the\r\nMeteorological Society of the Palatinate, together with some others, in\r\ncompiling a series of daily synchronous charts of Europe for the year\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nVery similar studies were carried out in America, a few years later, by\r\nJ. P. Espy, W. C. Redfield and Elias Loomis. Early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury a copious fund of meteorological observations had already\r\naccumulated in this country. The first undertaking in the nature of a\r\nmeteorological organization, foreshadowing the present Weather Bureau,\r\nwas due to Josiah Meigs, Commissioner of the General Land Office, who\r\nin 1817 established a system of tri-daily observations at the various\r\nland offices. At an almost equally early period the Surgeon General of\r\nthe Army inaugurated regular weather observations at the military posts\r\nthroughout the country. Local systems of observations were established\r\nby the authorities of New York State in 1825 and Pennsylvania in\r\n1837, and systems of broader scope by the Patent Office in 1841\r\nand the Smithsonian Institution in 1847. Experiments in collecting\r\nweather reports by telegraph for the purpose of forecasting storms\r\nwere undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution as early as 1849. At\r\nabout the same period Lieut. M. F. Maury, of the navy, was gathering\r\nmeteorological reports from mariners and laying the foundations of\r\nmarine meteorology. Finally, in 1870, Congress was induced to establish\r\na full-fledged telegraphic weather service, similar to those that were\r\nalready in successful operation in Europe. One of the great promoters\r\nof this enterprise was Dr. I. A. Lapham of Wisconsin; it had been\r\nrepeatedly advocated by Maury; and a convincing object lesson in its\r\nbehalf was furnished by the local service of reports and forecasts\r\nconducted by Prof. Cleveland Abbe, at the Cincinnati Observatory, with\r\nthe aid of the Western Union Telegraph Company, in 1869 and 1870.\r\nDuring the first twenty years of its existence, from 1870 to 1890, the\r\nFederal weather service was under the Signal Corps of the army. Since\r\n1890 it has been a branch of the Department of Agriculture, as the\r\nUnited States Weather Bureau, though the name “Signal Service” stuck to\r\nit, in popular speech, long after it ceased to belong to the army.\r\n\r\nIn this country weather forecasts are--or once were--said to emanate\r\nfrom “Old Probabilities,” or “Old Probs.” Our first “Old Probs” appears\r\nto have been Professor Abbe, who has explained the origin of this name\r\nin an account of his pioneer forecasting experiments at Cincinnati. He\r\nsays of the initial Cincinnati Weather Bulletin, issued September 1,\r\n1869:\r\n\r\n“It contained only a few observations telegraphed from distant\r\nobservers and announced ‘probabilities’ for the next day. This\r\nbulletin, in my own hand-writing, was posted prominently in the hall of\r\nthe Chamber of Commerce, but unfortunately I had misspelled ‘Tuesday,’\r\nand I soon found below my Probabilities the following humorous line\r\nby Mr. Davis, the well-known packer: ‘A bad spell of weather for “Old\r\nProbs.”’ This established my future very popular name of ‘Old Probs.’”\r\nThe name has, however, been more particularly associated with Gen.\r\nAlbert J. Myer, who, as Chief Signal Officer, was the first head of the\r\nFederal meteorological service.\r\n\r\nDesultory experiments in the collection of current weather reports and\r\ntheir use in constructing weather maps were first carried out in Europe\r\nat about the same time as the early undertakings of this character in\r\nAmerica. Such reports were gathered and published by James Glaisher,\r\nwith the cooperation of the British railways, in 1849. The existing\r\nnational weather services of the Old World owe their origin to an\r\nepisode of the Crimean War. In November, 1854, a violent storm wrought\r\nhavoc among the French and British warships in the Black Sea and sank\r\nmany vessels containing invaluable stores intended for the Allied\r\narmies in the Crimea. The French astronomer Le Verrier, director of\r\nthe Observatory of Paris, collected information showing the progress\r\nof this storm across Europe, and the results of this inquiry were so\r\nsignificant that he submitted to the Emperor Napoleon III the plan of\r\norganizing an international system of telegraphic reports, by means\r\nof which timely warning could be obtained of similar atmospheric\r\ndisturbances. The French Government, with the aid of other European\r\ncountries, established such a system in 1855. Within the next two\r\ndecades most of these countries organized their own services, and at\r\nthe same time maintained an international exchange of observations by\r\ntelegraph. Before the close of the nineteenth century nearly all the\r\ncivilized countries of the world, including many colonial possessions,\r\nsuch as Canada, Australia, Algeria and the Philippines, had established\r\nmeteorological services, entailing more or less extensive arrangements\r\nfor collecting daily reports by telegraph and issuing storm warnings\r\nand weather forecasts. The chief exceptions were several of the\r\nLatin-American republics and the Ottoman Empire, in which such\r\norganizations are still lacking.\r\n\r\nMeteorology is essentially an _international_ science. The atmosphere\r\nknows no political boundaries, and the more it is studied the more\r\nstrongly meteorologists are impressed with the fact that intimate\r\nrelations exist between the atmospheric events of widely separated\r\nregions of the world. Thus, the great anticyclone that is built up\r\nevery year over the cold interior of Siberia exercises an influence\r\nupon the weather of the United States; the behavior of the Indian\r\nmonsoons has been found to have some connection with barometric\r\nconditions in South America; and fluctuations in the force of the\r\ntrade winds are apparently of world-wide significance--whence these\r\nwinds have been described as the “pulse” of the general atmospheric\r\ncirculation. The French meteorologist L. Teisserenc de Bort called\r\nattention many years ago to the existence of what he called “centers\r\nof action”; viz., large permanent or semi-permanent areas of high and\r\nlow barometric pressure, the variations of which correspond strikingly\r\nwith the vicissitudes of wind and weather in countries thousands of\r\nmiles distant. Last but not least, persistent attempts have been made\r\nto interpret all the weather happenings on our globe in terms of a\r\nfluctuating supply of radiant energy received from the sun.\r\n\r\nFortunately meteorology has possessed an international organization\r\nfor a great many years. The International Meteorological Organization\r\nwas founded at a conference held at Leipzig in 1872, and was perfected\r\nat a formal congress of meteorologists convoked at Vienna in the\r\nfollowing year. The International Meteorological Committee, which is\r\nthe permanent working body of the organization, was established at\r\nthe Vienna Congress. Finally, the organization was reconstituted at a\r\nconference held at Paris, by invitation of the French Government, in\r\n1919.\r\n\r\nThe International Committee consists of not more than twenty members,\r\nall of whom are directors of official meteorological services. It\r\nis supposed to meet at least once in three years. At less frequent\r\nintervals are held “conferences,” to which are invited representatives\r\nof all the meteorological services and the principal independent\r\nmeteorological observatories of the world. Attached to the organization\r\nare several international “commissions,” which supervise and coordinate\r\nthe work of meteorologists in various special fields. At the close of\r\nthe year 1921 there were commissions on the following subjects:\r\n\r\nAgricultural Meteorology, Weather Telegraphy, Marine Meteorology,\r\nSolar Radiation, Application of Meteorology to Aerial Navigation,\r\nRéseau Mondial, and Polar Meteorology, Investigation of the Upper Air,\r\nTerrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity, Study of Clouds.\r\n\r\nEach commission includes in its membership at least one member of the\r\nInternational Committee, besides a number of experts, from different\r\ncountries, in the particular subject with which the commission is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions adopted at the various international meetings of\r\nmeteorologists have been collected in the “International Meteorological\r\nCodex,” the chief object of which is to secure uniformity in methods of\r\nobservation, forms of publication, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable international undertakings in the history of\r\nmeteorology was the plan of simultaneous observations, at Greenwich\r\nnoon, both at land stations and on board ships, adopted by the Vienna\r\nCongress at the suggestion of General Myer, and carried out under\r\nthe auspices and mainly at the expense of the United States Signal\r\nService. The results of these daily observations, from 1875 to 1887,\r\nwere published in detail, with charts, by the Signal Service. The many\r\nbulky volumes of this series, illustrating the meteorology of the globe\r\n(or mainly the northern hemisphere) day by day for a period of more\r\nthan a decade, are the modern analogue of the “Ephemerides” issued a\r\ncentury earlier by the Meteorological Society of the Palatinate--which\r\ncover very nearly the same length of time. In recent years the efforts\r\nof meteorologists have been bent toward establishing a so-called\r\n“réseau mondial,” or world-wide network of stations, which will not\r\nonly provide telegraphic reports for the use of forecasters, but will\r\nalso send their detailed records to an international commission to be\r\ncompiled and published. The telegraphic feature of this project now\r\nbids fair to be realized in a manner that was not contemplated when the\r\nplan was originally proposed; viz., by the broadcasting of weather\r\nreports from high-powered radio stations all over the world.\r\n\r\nAn effective “world weather bureau,” with permanent headquarters\r\nand staff, is at present the most urgent desideratum of practical\r\nmeteorology. Such a bureau would not only tie together the national\r\nweather services of the world and greatly facilitate their operations,\r\nbut would also digest the great mass of existing climatic statistics\r\nand provide for extending the climatological survey of the globe to\r\nregions where meteorological stations are scarce or lacking.\r\n\r\nA typical national meteorological service comprises a central station\r\nor institute, usually, but not always, situated at the national\r\ncapital, and a network or “réseau” of subordinate stations, which are\r\nsometimes classified, according to the extent of their observations,\r\nas stations of the first, second, and third order. They may also\r\nbe classified, from another point of view, as telegraphic and\r\nnontelegraphic stations. The former provide telegraphic reports of\r\ntheir observations, which serve as the foundation for forecasts, while\r\nthe latter are maintained chiefly for the purposes of climatology. In\r\nsome countries--notably in the United States--there are additional\r\nclasses of stations engaged in particular lines of work; these include\r\nstorm-warning stations, river stations (which report river stages and\r\nrainfall in the river basins), stations for agricultural meteorology,\r\netc. Several of the great maritime nations collect reports from vessels\r\non the high seas, including a small percentage of wireless reports. A\r\nnumber of the national meteorological services carry on work in other\r\nbranches of geophysics, such as seismology and terrestrial magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe United States Weather Bureau is an exception to the rule that,\r\napart from the central offices and a few special stations and large\r\nobservatories, meteorological stations are not generally manned by\r\nprofessional meteorologists, nor are the observers paid specifically\r\nfor their meteorological work, though in a great many cases they\r\nare public functionaries who are expected to take meteorological\r\nobservations in addition to their other duties. In this country there\r\nare about 200 stations at which the observers, of whom there are from\r\none to a dozen or more at each station, devote all their time to the\r\nwork of the stations and are salaried employees of the Weather Bureau,\r\nand there are several hundred minor stations manned by part-time paid\r\nemployees. But even in the United States the great majority of the\r\nmeteorological stations are operated by unpaid observers. There are\r\nabout 4,500 of these so-called “cooperative stations,” which provide\r\nthe bulk of the climatic statistics of the country.\r\n\r\nSome of the leading meteorological services of the world, and the\r\nplaces at which their central offices are located, are as follows:\r\n\r\nUnited States Weather Bureau (Washington), Meteorological Service of\r\nCanada (Toronto), Meteorological Office (London), Office National\r\nMétéorologique (Paris), Reale Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia e\r\nGeodinamica (Rome), Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik\r\n(Vienna), Indian Meteorological Department (Simla), Central\r\nMeteorological Observatory (Tokyo), Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology\r\n(Melbourne), Oficina Meteorológica Argentina (Buenos Aires).\r\n\r\nIn Germany there are several mutually independent meteorological\r\nestablishments, of which the Prussian Meteorological Institute,\r\nwith headquarters in Berlin, is the most important with respect to\r\nclimatology and research, while the Deutsche Seewarte, at Hamburg,\r\nis the chief center for telegraphic weather reports and issues the\r\nprincipal weather map. Russia, before her debacle, had one of the\r\nmost splendidly organized meteorological services in the world, with\r\nheadquarters at the Central Physical Observatory in Petrograd, and a\r\nseparate service for agricultural meteorology, which was the model\r\ninstitution of its kind. The Philippine Islands have a Weather Bureau\r\nwhich is entirely distinct from that of the United States. This Bureau,\r\nwith headquarters at the Manila Observatory, was founded by the\r\nJesuits, who also maintain a quasi-official meteorological service in\r\nChina, with headquarters at the Zikawei Observatory, near Shanghai.\r\n\r\nMany meteorological societies have done much for the progress of the\r\nscience, and in some cases have shared the duties of the official\r\nmeteorological services, especially in maintaining stations for\r\nclimatology. These include the Royal Meteorological Society and the\r\nformer Scottish Meteorological Society, in Great Britain, the French,\r\nItalian, German, Austrian, and Japanese meteorological societies, and\r\nthe American Meteorological Society, which was founded in December,\r\n1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nWEATHER MAPS AND FORECASTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Forecast”--with the stress on the first syllable when it is a noun,\r\nbut often on the second when it is a verb--is a word that meteorology\r\nhas made peculiarly its own. This fact is not the result of accident,\r\nbut of design.\r\n\r\nThe founder of scientific weather prediction in Great Britain was\r\nAdmiral Robert FitzRoy--the same talented officer who explored\r\nthe coasts of South America in the _Beagle_ and had Darwin for a\r\nfellow-voyager--and his first predictions were issued in 1861 from\r\nthe Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, which was under\r\nhis charge. The boldness of this pioneer undertaking is not easily\r\nrealized by the present generation, which is accustomed to see the\r\nofficial weather forecast at the head of every daily newspaper.\r\nWeather prognostication had previously been the undisputed province of\r\ncharlatans and quacks. For a civilized government to embark upon such\r\nan enterprise must have seemed, to the educated public, very much like\r\ncharging the Astronomer Royal with the duty of casting horoscopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GLASS WEATHER MAP OF THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of U. S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\nThere is much virtue in a name. A few years ago the United States\r\nBureau of Fisheries persuaded the American public to eat dogfish\r\nby changing its name to “grayfish.” Similarly, FitzRoy induced the\r\nBritish public to take his weather predictions seriously by calling\r\nthem “forecasts.” The name has stuck; and nowadays, throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world, the expression “weather forecast”--except\r\nas applied comprehensively to predictions of the “long-range”\r\nvariety--means something decidedly less chimerical than the average\r\nweather prophecy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUN DRAWING WATER\r\n\r\n(_Photograph by P. K. Budlong._)]\r\n\r\nIt is still necessary, however, to emphasize the distinction. There\r\nare probably many people among us, well above the illiterate level,\r\nwho have no clear idea as to what constitutes a scientific weather\r\nforecast. The distinguishing feature of such a prediction, apart from\r\nthe fact that it is made by a trained meteorologist, is that it is, in\r\nall cases, based upon a weather map.\r\n\r\nThe forecasting machine is a big one, with its human gear spread over\r\na wide territory. Eventually it will be spread over the entire globe,\r\nand then we shall have better forecasts. A little manual entitled “The\r\nWeather Map,” published by the British Meteorological Office, says:\r\n\r\n“The making of a single forecast in any one of the meteorological\r\noffices of Europe, America, Australia, or the Far East requires the\r\norganized cooperation of some hundreds of persons; about a hundred\r\nobservers who note the necessary observations simultaneously at as\r\nmany separate places and hand in their reports to the telegraphists\r\nwho transmit them to one center, where the meteorological expert\r\ncharts them on a map and draws therefrom the conclusions on which the\r\nforecasts are based. The preparation of the map is an essential part of\r\nthe process. No meteorologist in the modern sense attempts to forecast\r\nthe weather without reference to a map prepared either by himself or\r\nby some one with whom he is in direct communication, from observations\r\ntransmitted by telegraph for the purpose. No amount of weather wisdom\r\nor weather lore or experience is a substitute for the map. The more\r\nexpert and accomplished the meteorologist, the more certain he is that\r\nall he can do without the materials for constructing a map, though\r\nhe may have a barometer and other instruments at hand, is to make a\r\nguess at what the map is like and think out from that what the weather\r\nchanges are likely to be. It is a common experience of professional\r\nmeteorologists away from their base to find themselves appealed to for\r\nan opinion about the weather, judging from the signs of the sky alone,\r\nbecause they are learned in such things. That is exactly what they are\r\nnot. Accustomed to refer everything to a map, without one they feel\r\nthemselves to be rather worse off than those who are unaccustomed to\r\nits use. A modern meteorologist thinks in maps; his language and modes\r\nof expression are formed thereby.”\r\n\r\nWhile the weather map is prepared, first of all, for the use of the\r\nforecaster, who makes his predictions from the map before it has passed\r\nbeyond the manuscript stage, it has other important uses, which justify\r\nits publication and widespread distribution. The weather map is a\r\nweather newspaper. Like other newspapers, it is founded on a system of\r\ntelegraphic dispatches and is designed to keep us in touch with what\r\nis going on in the world. Weather news is of general interest because\r\nweather plays a part in most of the doings of humanity. Sometimes the\r\nnews we read on the face of the map merely satisfies our curiosity; at\r\nother times it renders us more substantial service.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustrating the manifold purposes served by weather maps,\r\nlet us set down two cases that are, perhaps, at opposite ends of the\r\nscale of utility. Our first case is that of the traveler who scans the\r\nmap to see whether the atmospheric conditions at his distant home are\r\npropitious, that day, for some outdoor pleasure event on the family\r\nprogram. This we may describe as a sentimental use of the map. The\r\nsecond case is that of an aviator embarking on a flight some time in\r\nthe fore part of the day, soon after the morning map has made its\r\nappearance. Here is a case in which the map is of vital utility, purely\r\nas a record of current conditions. The aviator is not concerned with\r\nthe forecast of the morrow’s weather, unless he is making an unusually\r\nlong flight, but he is immensely concerned with the winds and weather\r\nprevailing along his route at the time he flies, and these will not, as\r\na rule, differ radically from the conditions shown on the map of the\r\nsame morning.\r\n\r\nSince weather affects business in a variety of ways, people who have\r\nbusiness interests away from their places of residence frequently have\r\noccasion to consult the weather map. The influence of the weather on\r\ncrops explains why the map is watched with keen interest by dealers in\r\nagricultural products. Owners of vessels navigating the ocean or the\r\nGreat Lakes take a practical interest in the present as well as the\r\nfuture location of storms. And so on. It is not necessary to prolong\r\nthis list of those who use the weather map, because the popular demand\r\nfor it speaks for itself. It is worth while to record the fact that the\r\ndemand far exceeds the supply. In this country the Weather Bureau has\r\nbeen constantly harassed with urgent requests for the publication of\r\nmaps at places where, in consequence of limited appropriations, it has\r\nnot been possible to issue them.\r\n\r\nThe weather maps published in various parts of the world exhibit much\r\ndiversity in detail, though they have, of course, many features in\r\ncommon. As a rule a weather map covers a wider area than that of the\r\ncountry in which it is published. The aim has always been to make\r\nthese publications international, as far as practicable. The longest\r\ncontinuous file of printed daily weather maps in existence, viz.,\r\nthat established in France by Le Verrier in 1863 and still published,\r\nhas been called from its beginning the “Bulletin International.” It\r\nembraces nearly the whole of Europe, a little of Africa, Iceland,\r\nand the Azores. The other European maps now cover the same area or a\r\nconsiderable part of it. Before the war the Russian meteorological\r\nservice was issuing a map that included, in addition to Europe, a wide\r\nzone of Asia extending all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The United\r\nStates map, as published in its most extensive form at Washington,\r\ncomprises the whole of this country and southern Canada, besides\r\npresenting tabulated statistics for more distant parts of the world.\r\nManuscript maps prepared daily at Washington have a still broader\r\noutlook; they are drawn on a base map that covers the northern\r\nhemisphere, and the printing of a map of this sort, including a chain\r\nof stations extending around the globe, was undertaken in 1914,\r\nbut was interrupted by the war. The map published by the Argentine\r\nMeteorological Office, at Buenos Aires, covers more than half of South\r\nAmerica. Most national meteorological services issue weather maps, but\r\nthere are a few that do not. No such maps are published in South\r\nAfrica or any of the South American countries except Argentina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAND AREAS EMBRACED IN DAILY WEATHER MAPS AS PUBLISHED\r\nIN 1921]\r\n\r\nThus there is still much room for the horizontal extension of the\r\nweather map, and there is even more room for its vertical extension.\r\nDaily weather maps for aeronauts (chiefly wind maps) are now more or\r\nless on the programme of all the leading meteorological services,\r\nand in a few cases their publication has already begun. Probably the\r\nfirst maps of this character, showing the winds at various levels over\r\na whole country, were those that began to appear in Italy in 1913.\r\nThe British Meteorological Office now publishes such maps, showing\r\nwinds and clouds at different levels over the British Isles at three\r\nhours of the day. In the United States maps of the “wind aloft” are\r\nprepared daily, at Washington, from the reports of kite and balloon\r\nstations, but they are not yet published. The Weather Bureau has,\r\nmoreover, invented an ingenious method of depicting the winds at\r\nseveral levels on a single map; in other words, constructing a map in\r\nthree dimensions. This consists of attaching arrows to little metal\r\nposts erected on an ordinary weather map at points corresponding to\r\nthe location of the upper-air stations. Each post bears a series of\r\narrows--one arrow for each level charted--and the arrows are set in\r\npositions showing the direction of the wind at each level. Numbers on\r\nthe arrowheads indicate the force of the wind. When the map is finished\r\nit is photographed from two different angles so as to make a pair of\r\npictures suitable for viewing through a stereoscope. These stereoscopic\r\npictures were formerly made every day and a file of them is available\r\nfor reference and study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEREOSCOPIC MAP OF THE “WINDS ALOFT”]\r\n\r\nThere are a few conspicuous points of difference between the weather\r\nmaps issued in foreign countries and those issued in this country.\r\nThus a majority of the foreign weather services publish two or more\r\ncharts on the same sheet; either for the sake of showing different\r\nmeteorological elements separately or, in most cases, to represent\r\nthe conditions prevailing not only at the hour of the current morning\r\nobservation, but also at certain hours of the previous day. One of the\r\nthree editions of the British map includes four charts, corresponding\r\nto observations at four different hours. By means of such series of\r\ncharts one can observe the recent changes of weather as well as the\r\ncurrent conditions. Weather maps published in the United States show\r\nprimarily the conditions at 8 a. m., Eastern Standard Time, of the\r\nmorning of issue; though certain features of past weather are also\r\nindicated, including changes of temperatures, movements of storm\r\ncenters, etc. Evening maps are drawn at Washington and at many other\r\nplaces, but are not published.\r\n\r\nIn this country the publication of weather maps has been carried out on\r\na much more liberal scale than elsewhere. Instead of issuing maps at\r\nonly one or a few places, as is the custom in other parts of the world,\r\nit has been the policy of the American service to publish them at\r\npopulous centers all over the country. In some cases they are printed\r\nor manifolded at the local Weather Bureau station, and distributed\r\nby mail and messenger; in other cases they are published in the\r\nnewspapers. The daily circulation of the maps has thus, at times, run\r\nup into the millions. This comprehensive duplication of the chart is\r\nmade possible by special arrangements with the telegraph companies. The\r\nreports of observations are, to a large extent, sent over circuits,\r\nalong which the telegraph offices, besides forwarding the local report,\r\ncopy the reports from other stations as they pass over the wires.\r\nCertain stations, forming connecting links between the circuits, effect\r\nthe transfer of collected reports from one circuit to another; so\r\nthat, in a very short time, upward of 150 stations receive the reports\r\nfrom a large number of other stations. The maps issued at stations or\r\npublished in newspapers are generally rather crude, though they answer\r\ntheir purpose; but the large lithographed map issued every day at the\r\nCentral Office, in Washington, is much the most artistic production of\r\nits kind published anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENLARGED SECTION OF THE STEREOSCOPIC WIND MAP]\r\n\r\nLarge weather maps, drawn with colored chalk on a ground-glass base,\r\nmay be seen at certain produce exchanges and railway stations, on\r\nthe “boardwalk” at Atlantic City, and in the Capitol at Washington.\r\nMotion-picture weather maps, made from series of maps showing\r\nconditions at successive intervals of time, have been prepared\r\nexperimentally in this country and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe reports used in the construction of weather maps are telegraphed\r\nfrom the stations in cipher, in order to save expense. In Europe groups\r\nof figures are used for this purpose, but the United States Weather\r\nBureau makes use of a word code, which offers the advantage over a\r\nfigure code that, as a rule, mistakes in the telegrams can easily be\r\ndetected by anybody familiar with the code. The American weather code\r\nis something of a literary curiosity. In each of the many thousand\r\nwords it contains there are certain significant letters, and these must\r\nfall in certain sequences in order to convey the information required.\r\nThe English language has been ransacked--and somewhat stretched--to\r\nsecure the necessary words. Observers consult the code book in\r\nenciphering their reports, but translating is easily done without the\r\nbook by those who have mastered the relatively simple principles on\r\nwhich the code is constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMPLIFIED WEATHER MAP FOR JAN. 25, 1905, 8 A. M.,\r\nEASTERN STANDARD TIME]\r\n\r\nThe language of lines, shadings and symbols used in weather maps can\r\nbe learned in a few minutes, and it is, as a rule, fully explained on\r\nthe face of the map. This is true of foreign maps as well as American.\r\nA full-fledged weather map is hardly susceptible of reproduction\r\nin a book of ordinary dimensions. The simplified map that we show\r\nhere, taken from a Weather Bureau bulletin, will, however, serve to\r\nillustrate some of the features of such publications. The reader should\r\nfirst fix in his mind the explanations printed at the lower left-hand\r\ncorner of the map and then study the map in the light of what has been\r\nsaid in Chapter VIII about the circulation and movements of highs and\r\nlows. On this map we have an exceptionally well-developed high over\r\nthe middle of the country and a pronounced low on the Atlantic coast.\r\nThe former, with clear skies and very cold weather, constitutes a cold\r\nwave. The latter is attended by a widespread snow storm and, as may be\r\ninferred from the crowded isobars, by stormy winds.\r\n\r\nNow bear in mind the fact that charts identical with this one, except\r\nthat they contained much more detailed information, were issued in\r\nall the more important cities and towns of the United States on the\r\nmorning of January 25, 1905, about a couple hours after the taking\r\nof the morning observations, at 8 a. m., Eastern time. The same\r\nmorning, weather forecasts, cold-wave warnings and storm warnings,\r\ndeduced from this map, were issued to some hundreds of thousands of\r\naddresses by telegraph, telephone, mail, and messenger. The map itself\r\nconveys information comparable in interest to the news of public\r\nevents published on the first page of the newspapers the same day.\r\nThe forecasts and especially the warnings are, in such a case, worth\r\nmillions of dollars to the people of the United States. The following\r\naccount of the cold wave appears in the Annual Report of the Chief of\r\nthe Weather Bureau for 1905:\r\n\r\n“A severe cold wave appeared over the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and\r\nIowa on January 24, 1905, and on the 25th covered the central and upper\r\nMississippi valleys and extended over the northern portions of the\r\neast Gulf States, the line of zero temperature reaching into northern\r\nTennessee. On the 26th the cold wave covered Florida, and temperatures\r\nbelow freezing were reported as far south as Tampa and Jupiter. At the\r\nlatter place, the minimum temperature, 24 degrees, equaled the lowest\r\never recorded since the establishment of the Weather Bureau station at\r\nthat point. Considerable damage was done to orange trees where groves\r\ncould not be fired or protected. Ample warnings had been given of the\r\nexpected low temperatures.”\r\n\r\nThe subject of making forecasts from a weather map is one concerning\r\nwhich some big books have been written, and it cannot be dealt with\r\nvery satisfactorily in the brief space at our disposal. There are two\r\ncardinal rules--viz., (1) the weather has a characteristic distribution\r\nin relation to the distribution of barometric pressure, and (2)\r\npressure systems, with their attendant winds and weather, move, in\r\na general way, from west to east--but these rules require various\r\nqualifications and are subject to various exceptions. Thus highs and\r\nlows generally take rather circuitous routes in getting, eventually, to\r\nthe eastward, and sometimes they break up or fade out. The high shown\r\non the annexed map actually moved much more south than east during the\r\nfollowing twenty-four hours, while the low moved up the coast; i. e.,\r\nmore north than east. These were, however, the movements expected by\r\nthe experienced forecaster.\r\n\r\nWell-developed highs are nearly always regions of clear weather and, in\r\nwinter, of cold weather. Lows are attended by clouds and precipitation;\r\nrising temperature usually precedes them and falling temperature\r\nfollows them. The professional forecaster recognizes several types of\r\npressure distribution other than ordinary highs and lows, and they,\r\nalso, have their characteristic winds and weather. The seven typical\r\nforms of isobars, as classified many years ago by R. Abercromby, are:\r\nCyclone; anticyclone; secondary; V-shaped depression, or trough;\r\nwedge of high pressure; col, or saddle, between two anticyclones; and\r\nstraight isobars. These may be combined in a variety of ways on the\r\nweather map. The forecaster learns to classify these combinations\r\nconsciously or subconsciously, and grows familiar with their habits and\r\nmannerisms. Forecasters spend a good deal of time in studying the files\r\nof weather maps for past years; but the results of such studies are not\r\neasy to reduce to definite statements. Scientific forecasting is, in\r\nits present stage, almost wholly empirical. The dependence of weather\r\nchanges upon the phenomena of atmospheric circulation is generally\r\neasy to make out, but the vagaries of winds and pressure are still in\r\nthe main mysterious; notwithstanding such interesting developments as\r\n(1) the much-discussed rules of M. Gabriel Guilbert for predicting the\r\nmovements of barometric depressions from abnormalities in the force and\r\ndirection of the winds; (2) the systematic charting of “isallobars,”\r\nor lines of equal pressure change, associated especially with the name\r\nof Dr. Nils Ekholm; and finally (3) the hypothesis of a sharp line\r\nof demarcation between masses of equatorial and polar air along the\r\nso-called “polar front,” forming the basis of a system of forecasting\r\nthat originated at the Geophysical Institute of Bergen, Norway, and has\r\nhad a marked influence upon the methods of forecasters in other parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAs to the practical results of this empirical art, one point of the\r\nutmost importance is commonly overlooked by the public when it\r\ncomplains about the mistakes of the forecaster. He is required to make\r\nforecasts of weather day after day, regardless of the kind of map\r\nthat is laid before him. Sometimes the map is so featureless (or, as\r\nthe forecasters say, “flat”) that there is little in it on which to\r\nbuild a forecast. At other times there is an abundance of features,\r\nbut they are in process of rapid and disconcerting change. In either\r\ncase the ordinary day-to-day weather forecast is likely to go astray.\r\nThe brighter side of this picture is that the atmospheric phenomena\r\nthat count heavily in terms of dollars and imperiled human lives are\r\nnot found on “flat” maps, and, when they appear on the map, generally\r\nbehave in a simple, straightforward way. In other words, such events as\r\ngreat storms and cold waves are far easier to forecast than everyday\r\nweather, and it is the successful prediction of these events that\r\nfurnishes the principal _raison d’être_ of an expensive telegraphic\r\nforecasting service.\r\n\r\nSince weather predictions serve a variety of purposes, many different\r\nkinds of forecasts and warnings have been developed by meteorological\r\nservices. In this country there are, first of all, district forecasts\r\nand local forecasts; the former, covering whole States and groups of\r\nStates, being issued at a few main forecasting centers, while the\r\nlatter, applying to a single town and its vicinity, are issued at a\r\nlarge number of the ordinary Weather Bureau stations. There is a long\r\nlist of forecasts and warnings intended for special classes of the\r\ncommunity; indeed the specialization of forecasts is carried so far\r\nthat an individual citizen or a single business firm can generally\r\nobtain, by asking for it, a forecast of any specified predictable\r\nfeature of the weather for a particular place. The established types\r\nof special prediction issued regularly, or when conditions warrant,\r\ninclude wind and weather forecasts and storm warnings for mariners;\r\nshippers’ forecasts, relating to temperatures injurious to perishable\r\ngoods; aviation forecasts; “fire-weather” warnings, issued when the\r\nweather is conducive to fires in the western forests; avalanche\r\nwarnings; and several different kinds of advices for the benefit\r\nof agriculture and horticulture. The United States Weather Bureau,\r\nalthough it is not the only branch of the Government that carries\r\non work in hydrology, is the one charged with the duty of issuing\r\nriver-stage predictions and flood warnings. An elaborate organization\r\nis maintained for this purpose, and the results are extremely\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe period of time covered by an official weather forecast is\r\ngenerally from one to two days. In this country the morning forecast\r\nis ordinarily for 36 hours from 8 a. m., and the evening forecast for\r\n48 hours from 8 p. m., but occasionally the period is extended for an\r\nadditional day. For some years the Weather Bureau has issued every\r\nSaturday a forecast in quite general terms relating to the whole of\r\nthe following week. These long-range forecasts are made for extensive\r\nareas of the country, such as the North and Middle Atlantic States, the\r\nOhio Valley and Tennessee, and the Great Lakes region. “From the weekly\r\nforecast,” says an official publication, “a farmer may know whether\r\nit is safe to cut his hay at the beginning of the week or whether\r\nit would be better to wait till the last of the week; and a produce\r\ndealer may know whether it is safe, at a particular time in the early\r\nspring, to start a carload of strawberries to a northern market.” The\r\nBritish Meteorological Office follows a more cautious plan. Its regular\r\nforecasts are for twenty-four hours, but occasionally, when conditions\r\nare fairly settled, announcements are made of what is termed the\r\n“further outlook.” The same office sends notices to the agricultural\r\ndistricts when a spell of fine weather, favorable for haying or the\r\nlike, appears to be on the programme.\r\n\r\nThere are a few official meteorological establishments that have\r\nembarked on much more ambitious undertakings in long-range forecasting.\r\nThe classic example is furnished by the Indian Meteorological\r\nDepartment, which has issued seasonal forecasts of rainfall ever since\r\n1882. These were originally based upon reports of the snowfall in\r\nthe Himalaya, abnormalities of which, as noted in the spring, appear\r\nto be related to the intensity of the subsequent monsoon rainfall.\r\nEventually the Indian meteorologists began to seek in more remote\r\nregions for clues to the character of the Indian seasons, and they\r\nbelieve they have found them; the barometric pressure in South America\r\nand at Mauritius, the rainfall at Zanzibar and Seychelles, the Nile\r\nflood, and summer rains in Australia all seems to bear some relation to\r\nmeteorological conditions in India.\r\n\r\nThe study of world-wide interrelations of weather, although it has\r\nnot generally, as in the case just mentioned, furnished the basis\r\nof official forecasts, has engaged the attention of a great many\r\nable meteorologists. We have spoken on another page of the “centers\r\nof action” that seem to be such important indexes to changes in the\r\ncirculation of the atmosphere, with concomitant fluctuations in\r\nweather. Telegraphic reports from some of these centers, including the\r\nIceland and Aleutian lows and the Siberian and Azores highs, have\r\nhelped to guide the Weather Bureau in making its weekly forecasts. Many\r\nattempts have been made to predict the weather months in advance from\r\nvariations in the temperatures of the water in different parts of the\r\nocean or from the distribution of sea ice in high latitudes. Another\r\nline of attack upon the problem of long-range forecasting is through\r\nobservations of solar activities, as indicated by fluctuations in solar\r\nradiation, the prevalence of sun spots, etc. Lastly, an immense amount\r\nof energy has been expended in efforts to detect definite cycles or\r\nperiodicities in the weather itself, without regard to their causes.\r\nThe thirty-five year period of rainfall and temperature variations,\r\nannounced in 1890 by Prof. E. Brückner, has found a place in all the\r\ncurrent textbooks on meteorology, and several other alleged weather\r\nperiods have been the subject of serious discussion.\r\n\r\nFrom all of which it appears that the professional meteorologist is\r\nnot at all inclined to discountenance attempts at long-range weather\r\nprediction, provided they are made both honestly and intelligently.\r\nUnfortunately the vast majority of people who, in all ages, have\r\nindulged in this sort of vaticination--and their name is legion--have\r\nbeen either dishonest or ignorant, or both. The world is still well\r\nsupplied with them, and they are, undeniably, a thorn in the flesh\r\nof the scientific forecaster, who sometimes sees his predictions\r\nconfounded with theirs by the public, and who commonly incurs the\r\ncharge of jealousy and narrow-mindedness because he declines to\r\nacknowledge brotherhood with the cranks and impostors who hang about\r\nthe outskirts of his profession.\r\n\r\nQuack weather predictions are nearly always made for long periods in\r\nadvance, and their popularity depends upon the fact that they give\r\nthe public something--however fallacious it may be--that science\r\ndoes not attempt to give. The making of such predictions appears to\r\nbe a particularly easy way of acquiring both fame and fortune. In\r\nthis country there has hardly ever been a time when some exponent\r\nof this industry did not enjoy a nation-wide reputation. It is a\r\nsatisfaction to record, however, that foreign countries produce the\r\nsame sort of celebrities. Dr. Gustav Hellmann, writing in Germany,\r\nhas recently published an extremely interesting account of the famous\r\n“weather prophets” of the 19th and 20th centuries. Their geographical\r\ndistribution is given as follows: Belgium, 2; Germany, 36; England,\r\n25; France, 14; Italy, 2; Austria-Hungary, 8; Russia, 1; Sweden, 1;\r\nSwitzerland, 5; Spain, 2; North America, 9. The list for the United\r\nStates is, to be sure, conspicuously incomplete, but we need not grieve\r\nover the fact that the fame of the American prophets omitted from the\r\nlist has not spread to the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe almanac is, as it has always been, the chief stronghold of\r\nlong-range weather predicting. Nobody knows to what extent the almanac\r\nprognostications are taken seriously by the public, or are meant\r\nto be by the publishers. It is to be feared that the percentage of\r\nthe population that “swears by them” is not inconsiderable. Almanac\r\npublishers would undoubtedly perform a public service, and perhaps\r\nsave themselves some pangs of conscience, if they would append to\r\ntheir weather predictions the statement that, like the portrait of the\r\ngentleman who displays his anatomy to the signs of the zodiac at the\r\nfront of the book, they are published merely for the sake of keeping\r\nup an old custom, and if they would conclude every almanac with the\r\nfollowing candid avowal, which we find in Gabriel Frende’s “Almanack\r\nand Prognostication” for 1589:\r\n\r\n  Thou hast my guess at daily weather\r\n    Here present in thy view.\r\n  My credit shall not lie thereon\r\n    That every word is true:\r\n  Yet some to please I thought it best\r\n  To shew my mynde among the reste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo farmers are grumbling about the weather. The scene is Ohio, the\r\ntime July, and the prevalent crop corn (i. e., maize).\r\n\r\nFarmers have grumbled about the weather from time immemorial. The\r\npoint of interest in this particular case is that the two grumblers do\r\nnot agree about what is wrong. Farmer A thinks the corn needs rain.\r\nFarmer B declares that at this stage rain would do more harm than\r\ngood. Plenty of warm sunshine is, he thinks, the right prescription to\r\ninsure a “bumper” crop. Of course Providence will do as it pleases,\r\nand whatever weather comes, since it cannot be cured, must be endured;\r\nbut it is a matter of practical as well as academic interest to get\r\nsome inkling betimes as to how your crop is going to turn out, and\r\nthe weather is likely to be the decisive factor. Moreover, it is a\r\nvery significant fact that our two farmers are not of the same mind\r\nabout which atmospheric blessing is in default. It is painful to\r\nreflect that an enormous amount of grumbling about the weather on the\r\npart of the rustic community must, at one time or another, have been\r\nmisapplied. It is a plausible assumption that farmers have sometimes\r\nworried themselves to death over meteorological events that were either\r\nharmless or actually beneficial to their crops.\r\n\r\nHow can we arrive at the facts? Admitting, as everybody does, that the\r\nweather has a preeminent influence upon plant life, is this influence\r\nsusceptible of analysis? Is there anything definite about it? Are not\r\nthe effects of various atmospheric conditions so entangled with one\r\nanother, and with the effects of soil and methods of cultivation--to\r\nsay nothing of insects and plant diseases--as to baffle all attempts to\r\ngauge them separately?\r\n\r\nThere is a new branch of applied science that teaches farmers how to\r\ngrumble right about the weather. It is called Agricultural Meteorology.\r\nAs a coherent branch of knowledge, this subject is so new that the\r\nfirst formal textbook about it in the English language was published\r\nin the year 1920. It happens that the author of this book, Professor\r\nJ. Warren Smith, of the United States Weather Bureau, began his\r\ninvestigations in the new field by making a careful study of the\r\nrelation of weather to the yield of corn in Ohio. Let us see what light\r\nhis studies shed upon the question at issue between our friends A and B.\r\n\r\nDay after day, and year after year, the principal atmospheric\r\nconditions are observed and measured at a great number of points\r\nscattered over the State of Ohio, as they are elsewhere throughout the\r\nUnion, and the records thus obtained are carefully compiled, summed up,\r\naveraged and otherwise discussed by officials of the Weather Bureau.\r\nThus a great fund of detailed statistical information about the weather\r\nis available for comparison with the statistics gathered by other\r\nagencies concerning the yield of crops and their condition at different\r\nstages of growth.\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith’s analysis of the Ohio records revealed a fact of so\r\nmuch practical importance that this discovery alone suffices to place\r\nagricultural meteorology among the most fruitful branches of knowledge\r\ncultivated by mankind. He discovered that the success of the Ohio corn\r\ncrop depends chiefly upon the amount of rain that falls during the\r\nmonth of July. The normal rainfall of that month for the State is 4\r\ninches, while the average yield of corn during the past sixty years has\r\nbeen 34.5 bushels per acre. Comparing the values for individual years,\r\nit is found that the yield is strikingly sensitive to variations from\r\nthe normal July rainfall, and especially so when the rainfall is a\r\nlittle more or less than 3 inches. Near this critical rainfall point, a\r\nvariation of _one-fourth inch_ of rain in July means a variation in the\r\nvalue of the corn crop of Ohio of nearly $3,000,000, and a variation of\r\none-half inch makes an average variation in the value of the crop of\r\nmore than $7,500,000. When the rainfall for July averages over 5 inches\r\nthe probable yield of corn will be more than 27,000,000 bushels greater\r\nthan it will be if the rainfall averages less than 3 inches. In other\r\nwords, this difference of 2 inches in the rainfall for the month of\r\nJuly adds $13,650,000 to the income derived by Ohio farmers from corn\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nVariations of the temperature in July, in Ohio, have been compared with\r\nvariations in the yield of corn, with the result that the temperature\r\nof the month appears to have little effect upon the crop. Thus we find\r\nFarmer A to have been right and Farmer B wrong; but both were merely\r\nexpressing personal opinions based upon an insignificant sum-total of\r\nexperience. Science rests upon a surer foundation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the case of the Ohio corn crop is probably simpler than\r\nmost of those that agricultural meteorology has to deal with, for\r\nthe reason that a single meteorological element is, in this case, of\r\ndecisive importance, it illustrates a rule of quite general application\r\nthat has recently come to light; viz., that in the growth of any\r\nparticular crop there is usually a rather brief “critical period,”\r\nwhen it is most sensitive to the influence of weather. For corn, in a\r\nconsiderable area of the northern United States, this period is July,\r\nor more specifically, in Ohio, the interval from July 11 to August 10.\r\nThe rainfall and temperature of other months have, however, definite\r\nthough minor influences, which can be evaluated for the same regions.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the American “corn belt” in general, it is not certain\r\nhow far the rules deduced for Ohio are applicable. Professor Smith\r\nhas been inclined to look upon July rainfall as the dominating factor\r\nfor the whole of that region; so that, for example, a difference of 1\r\ninch in the rainfall (viz., a total for July of 4.4 inches or more,\r\nas compared with 3.4 inches or less) has been held responsible for\r\nan increase of 500,000,000 bushels of corn in the eight principal\r\ncorn-growing States. It has also been stated that in the four States\r\nof Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri an increase of half an inch\r\nof rain in July meant an increase of $150,000,000 in the value of the\r\ncrop. These figures have, however, been challenged, and the subject is\r\nstill under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe study of the critical periods of different crops, and the\r\ndetermination of the amounts of heat and moisture most favorable\r\nto the success of the crop at such periods, may be regarded as the\r\nleading task of the agricultural meteorologist. The most elaborate\r\nresearches of this character have been made in Russia by Professor\r\nP. Brounov, who founded in 1896 a meteorological bureau, attached to\r\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, with an extensive network of stations\r\nscattered over the Russian Empire. This bureau was quite distinct from\r\nthe ordinary meteorological service, under the direction of the Central\r\nPhysical Observatory in St. Petersburg. Just before the war Professor\r\nBrounov had 150 stations in operation; most of them for observing the\r\neffects of weather on the leading cereal crops, though some studied\r\nthe corresponding relations of horticulture or the animal industries.\r\nEach agricultural station comprised a small plot of land, on which a\r\ncertain sequence of crops was grown year after year under conditions\r\nof cultivation as nearly uniform as possible, the only variable factor\r\nbeing the weather. Meteorological instruments were installed in the\r\nimmediate proximity of the plants under investigation. Prior to 1914\r\nBrounov had determined the critical periods of most of the crops grown\r\nin Russia, and had published a great deal of information on this\r\nsubject that could be turned to practical account by Russian farmers.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps not be immediately apparent to the reader just how\r\nsuch information can be utilized. Its practical applications vary,\r\nin fact, according to circumstances. First of all, a knowledge of\r\ncritical periods and of the weather requirements of crops at these\r\nperiods enables the farmer to select his crops and time his farming\r\noperations on the basis of climatic statistics. Brounov published a\r\nseries of charts showing the probability of dry weather, as deduced\r\nfrom many years of observations, for each ten-day period throughout\r\nthe agricultural year for every part of European Russia. With such\r\ncharts at our disposal, and knowing how long after planting each crop\r\narrives at its critical period with respect to moisture, we can readily\r\nestimate the probable success of a given crop planted at a given\r\ntime and place; at least, so far as this is determined by rainfall.\r\nIf temperature or other meteorological conditions are of special\r\nimportance at the critical periods, we shall need additional climatic\r\ncharts. Of course, the weather in any particular year may differ widely\r\nfrom the climatic averages; but in the long run crops will prosper in\r\nproportion as their critical periods coincide with the occurrence of\r\nfavorable weather as shown by the climatic record. It will be seen\r\nthat this is quite a different idea from the traditional one that a\r\ncertain crop needs a “moist climate,” another a “hot climate,” etc. The\r\nagriculturist now asks the man of science to tell him _when_, between\r\nplanting and harvesting, heat or moisture is of vital importance to the\r\ncrop, and _how much_ of each will produce the biggest yield.\r\n\r\nIn regions where irrigation is practiced it is obviously advantageous\r\nto the farmer to know at what stage of its growth a crop becomes\r\nsensitive to the amount of moisture received. During the greater part\r\nof its life the plant may be quite indifferent to moisture, and at\r\nsuch times irrigation would be wasteful. The farmer needs to know not\r\nonly when the critical period has arrived, but also what the water\r\nrequirements are at that period. Too much water may be as bad as too\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nEven when agricultural practice ignores the rules laid down by the\r\nagricultural meteorologist, a knowledge of these rules may be applied\r\nwith great advantage to the prediction of crop yields. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to tell any farmer or business man that accurate crop\r\nforecasts are an economic desideratum of the utmost importance. The\r\nUnited States Government maintains an army of more than 200,000\r\nvolunteer crop reporters, supervised by a staff of experts, for\r\nthe purpose of determining month by month the condition of every\r\nagricultural crop and its prospective yield. With regard to the monthly\r\nannouncements of the Bureau of Crop Estimates, Professor H. L. Moore,\r\nof Columbia University, says:\r\n\r\n“The commodity markets are in a state of nervous expectancy as the time\r\napproaches for the official forecasts, because great values are at\r\nstake. It has been estimated that in the case of the cotton crop alone\r\nan error in the forecasts which should lead to a depression of one cent\r\na pound in the price of cotton-lint would--assuming a crop equal to\r\nthat of 1914--entail a loss of eighty million dollars to the farmers.\r\nThe vast values at stake and the dangers when no official estimate\r\nis available of the manipulation of the markets in the interest of\r\nspeculators are held to justify the large recurrent annual cost of the\r\nemployment of the numerous correspondents, clerks, and experts.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Moore is one of those who have pointed out that the forecasts\r\nbased upon the actual condition of the growing crops can be vastly\r\nimproved by a mathematical analysis of the weather reports from the\r\nvarious regions in which the crops are grown. In fact, he goes so far\r\nas to assert that much better forecasts can be made from the weather\r\nreports alone than from reports on the condition of the crops. Whether\r\nor not this view is unduly optimistic, it goes without saying that the\r\nprecise data which agricultural meteorology is now acquiring cannot\r\nfail to enhance greatly the accuracy of crop forecasts.\r\n\r\nOf course, the weather has always been watched with keen interest by\r\neverybody concerned with the purchase or sale of agricultural products\r\nand has been one of the chief factors determining the rise and fall of\r\nprices. At produce exchanges throughout the United States daily weather\r\nbulletins are received from the agricultural districts, and at many of\r\nthem a large weather map is drawn every morning by an employee of the\r\nWeather Bureau detailed for this purpose. The Bureau has made various\r\nother arrangements for supplying the information that is so eagerly\r\ndesired concerning the weather as it affects crops, as well as the\r\nanimal industries. During the “growing season” in the cotton, corn,\r\nwheat, sugar, rice, broom-corn and cattle-producing areas, designated\r\ncenters receive telegraphic reports of rainfall and the daily extremes\r\nof temperature from substations in the regions concerned, and these are\r\ndistributed in bulletin form. Each local center, besides publishing\r\ndetailed reports from its own area, issues condensed reports from all\r\nthe others. The Bureau also issues every week during the agricultural\r\nseason a “National Weather and Crop Bulletin,” with text and charts\r\nsetting forth the current conditions of moisture, temperature, etc.,\r\nand the state of the crops in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe use which dealers and farmers make of these weather reports is,\r\nhowever, very far from having been reduced to science. Some of these\r\npersons, it is true, are frequently able, by a purely instinctive\r\nprocess of deduction, to make successful forecasts of crop yields from\r\na close study of the weather, and others have worked out crude rules\r\nof their own for the same purpose; but the agricultural meteorologist\r\napproaches the problem in a different way. Immense progress has\r\nbeen made in the past decade in applying the mathematical theory of\r\n_correlation_ to this problem. This branch of mathematics, originally\r\ndeveloped chiefly for statistical studies in biology by Galton,\r\nPearson, and others, is now extensively used by meteorologists not only\r\nfor studying the effects of weather on crops, but also for finding\r\nout what correspondences or relationships exist between variations of\r\nweather in different parts of the world, as well as between weather and\r\nsun spots, weather and vital statistics, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the farmers do not disagree on the subject of\r\nfavorable and unfavorable weather for the crops, they hold opinions\r\nin common that agricultural meteorology is unable to substantiate. An\r\nillustration is found in the idea that a good covering of snow during\r\nthe winter is favorable to the yield of winter wheat. Apparently this\r\nis one of the host of popular ideas that are based merely on the\r\ndelusive foundation of “everybody says so.” Smith has investigated the\r\nstatistics of wheat for Ohio and C. J. Root those for Illinois. In both\r\ncases their results negative the prevailing opinion. Professor Smith\r\nfinds “some evidence to indicate that wheat has a better prospect if\r\nit is not covered by snow during the month of January,” while Mr. Root\r\nstates that, in general, “the winters of light snowfall are followed by\r\ngood wheat yields and the winters of heavy snowfall by light yields.”\r\n\r\nThe study of the relations between weather and crops is really a branch\r\nof a science of broader scope, known as _phenology_. This science is\r\ndevoted to the investigation of all periodic phenomena of plant and\r\nanimal life that are controlled by the weather. There are, in some\r\nparts of the world, large corps of phenological observers, who maintain\r\nrecords year after year of the leafing, flowering, and fruiting of both\r\nwild and cultivated plants, the migrations and first songs of birds,\r\nand various other events of a biological character that recur with the\r\nseasons. In the course of time it becomes possible to compute from such\r\nrecords the normal dates of these events; and then, in any particular\r\nyear, a comparison between the actual dates and the normal shows\r\nwhether the season is early or late, and by how many days. Phenological\r\nobservations on plants also make it possible to draw charts showing the\r\nnormal march of the seasons over a country, expressed in terms of plant\r\nlife, and such charts are often more valuable to the agriculturist or\r\nhorticulturist as a guide in selecting varieties for cultivation and\r\nin timing his operations, than any charts that can be compiled from\r\nordinary climatic data. Some admirable charts of this kind have been\r\ndrawn for parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are many practical applications of phenology to agriculture,\r\nand there would be more if phenological observations had been made\r\nmore extensively throughout the world. Good phenological charts of\r\ndifferent regions would, for example, greatly facilitate the work of\r\nforeign plant introduction carried on by the United States Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry. In the United States phenological observations were\r\nmade systematically between 1850 and 1863, but only desultory work has\r\nbeen done in this line subsequently. The most comprehensive individual\r\nrecord is that maintained by Thomas Mikesell from 1873 to 1912, at\r\nWauseon, Ohio, and published in full by the Weather Bureau in 1915.\r\n\r\nThe old rule of American farmers, inherited from the Indians, that the\r\ntime to plant corn is when the leaf of the white oak is “the size of a\r\nmouse’s ear,” illustrates the use that can be made of so-called “index\r\nplants” of the native flora as guides for farming operations. Professor\r\nA. D. Hopkins writes on this subject:\r\n\r\n“If such guide plants do not occur on the farm, they can be found among\r\nthe ornamental trees and shrubs and hardy flowering plants of other\r\nlocalities or countries and transplanted. The periodical event of the\r\nfalling of the flower catkins of the Carolina poplar has been found to\r\nbe one of the best guides to the general early or late character of one\r\nseason as compared with the average, while the opening of the leaf buds\r\nand unfolding of the leaves serve as reliable guides to the progress of\r\nspring. The various magnolias in their succession of flowering events\r\nserve as excellent guides to the rate of progress of spring and the\r\ntime to do various kinds of work. The ornamental Spiræas, Deutzias,\r\nDiervillas, climbing roses, and Clematis among the ornamentals, and\r\nthe dogwood, service tree, redbud, and oaks among the native trees of\r\nthe middle and eastern regions of the United States are more or less\r\nconstant in their response to prevailing local influences which are\r\nindicative of the time to plant certain field and garden crops. The\r\nopening of the leaf and flower buds and the flowering of the common\r\nfruit trees and shrubs of almost every farm serve as more or less\r\nreliable guides to the time to spray for certain insect and plant\r\ndiseases.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hopkins has worked out an interesting rule known as the\r\n“bioclimatic law,” according to which the periodical events of plant\r\nand animal life advance over the United States at the rate of 1\r\ndegree of latitude, 5 degrees of longitude, and 400 feet of altitude\r\nevery four days--northward, eastward, and upward in spring, and\r\nsouthward, westward, and downward in autumn. Thus, when the date of\r\nany phenological occurrence is known for one locality, it may be\r\napproximately determined for any other. This law has enabled the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture to publish rules of general application\r\nconcerning the best time to plant winter wheat in order to escape\r\nthe ravages of the Hessian fly, thus saving many millions of dollars\r\nto American farmers. The same law is susceptible of various other\r\nprofitable uses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORCHARD HEATERS IN OPERATION. The economical use of this\r\nmethod of frost protection depends upon accurate forecasts of the right\r\ntime to “fire” the orchard. (_Courtesy of Hamilton Orchard Heater Co._)]\r\n\r\nThe United States Weather Bureau has been a branch of the Department\r\nof Agriculture since 1890, and a very large share of its routine\r\nwork is devoted to the agricultural interests of the country. The\r\nclimatological statistics that it has assembled are indispensable in\r\nmany departments of agricultural research, besides furnishing varied\r\ninformation of practical value to farmers. The Bureau has developed a\r\nnumber of special types of forecasts for the rural industries; such as\r\npredictions, three or four days in advance, of favorable weather for\r\ncutting alfalfa; forecasts of weather unfavorable for sheep-shearing;\r\nnotices to fruit growers of dry-weather periods in which fruit trees\r\nshould be sprayed; and warnings of the occasional summer showers that\r\nwould do so much damage to the great raisin-drying industry of\r\nCalifornia but for the vigilance of the forecasters and the efficient\r\narrangements made by the industry itself for disseminating and acting\r\nupon the warnings. Of course, the ordinary daily weather forecasts,\r\nstorm warnings, and cold-wave warnings are valuable in many ways to\r\nagriculturists, and the Bureau has made great efforts to give such\r\ninformation prompt and general distribution in the rural districts.\r\nThe forecasts are generally displayed in post offices, and in many\r\ncases the rural telephone exchanges are pressed into service to\r\ndistribute weather information regularly to all their subscribers.\r\nSome exchanges sound a signal every morning when the forecast is ready\r\nfor distribution. Lastly, the wireless telegraph and the wireless\r\ntelephone, which, in the immediate future, will form part of the\r\nequipment of every up-to-date farm, afford ideal channels for the\r\ndissemination of weather news and are already extensively used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SNOW SURVEYOR AT WORK.

Aller._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW ROLLERS, OR WIND-BLOWN SNOWBALLS ON A LAWN AT\r\nPOTSDAM, N. Y. (_Photographed by T. J. Moon._)]\r\n\r\nThere remain to be mentioned the various steps the Weather Bureau\r\nhas taken to protect the rural industries from the night frosts of\r\nspring and autumn, in the shape of special forecasting arrangements,\r\nthe publication of frost charts, and a wide range of scientific\r\ninvestigations. The Bureau’s undertakings in this line are merely a\r\npart, though a leading one, of a great campaign of frost protection\r\nthat is being carried on by scientific and official agencies in this\r\ncountry on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nFrosts, classified according to their severity as “light,” “heavy,”\r\nand “killing,” are most likely to occur in spring and autumn, when\r\nan extensive area of high barometric pressure brings its usual\r\naccompaniment of clear skies and calm nights. They are predicted on\r\na general scale from the weather map, and locally from indications\r\nof temperature and humidity and a knowledge of important topographic\r\ninfluences, such as those due to hills and valleys and neighboring\r\nbodies of water.\r\n\r\nIn agricultural usage the term “frost” is applied to the occurrence of\r\na temperature low enough to kill or injure tender vegetation, such as\r\ngrowing vegetables or the buds, blossoms, and fruit of fruit trees. The\r\noccurrence of a frost, in this sense, is not necessarily identical with\r\nthe deposit of ice crystals known as “hoarfrost.” Different species\r\nand varieties of plants are, of course, susceptible in very different\r\ndegrees to the effects of low temperature; i. e., they differ greatly\r\nin “hardiness.” In the case of fruits and vegetables the danger point\r\ngenerally lies a little below the freezing point of water (32 degrees\r\nF.).\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of frost is favored by the rapid cooling, by radiation,\r\nof the earth and its plant covering, which goes on at night under a\r\nclear sky and in still air. Under these conditions a layer of stagnant,\r\ncold air forms close to the ground, with warmer air lying above it. The\r\ndifference in temperature at different levels is often so pronounced\r\nthat fruit on the lower branches of a tree is killed while that growing\r\non the higher branches remains uninjured. Similarly, frost will occur\r\nin the bottom of an inclosed valley but not on the surrounding slopes.\r\nIn the case of a valley the layer of cold air that forms at the bottom\r\nis commonly deepened by additional cold air draining down from the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nMany large orchards have their “warm spots” and their “cold islands” or\r\n“north poles,” well known to the orchardist; due in some cases to the\r\nnature of the soil rather than to topography. Certain mountain regions\r\nin North Carolina are famous for their “thermal belts” or “verdant\r\nzones”; i. e., areas part way up the slopes that escape the frosts\r\noccurring both above and below them. These frostless belts, which have\r\nbeen the subject of numerous investigations for three-quarters of a\r\ncentury, seem to mark the upper level of the pool of cold air that\r\ncollects in the valley by drainage from the mountainsides. A detailed\r\ntemperature survey of the thermal belt region of North Carolina was\r\nmade during the years 1912-1916 by the United States Weather Bureau\r\nand the North Carolina State Board of Agriculture. In some places the\r\nminimum temperature at night was found to be 15 or 20 degrees higher in\r\nthe thermal belt than at the bottom of the valley, a few hundred feet\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nClouds, by checking radiation from the earth, and wind, by mixing\r\nthe colder and warmer layers of air together, both prevent frosts\r\nthat would otherwise occur. Artificial methods of protection include\r\ncovering plants with screens of wood, paper, or cloth, building smudge\r\nfires to provide a blanket of smoke (a method of doubtful value),\r\nand, above all, heating by means of wood fires or various types of\r\n“orchard heater,” burning either oil or coal. An elaborate technique\r\nof orchard heating has been developed, having in view especially the\r\nmost economical use of fuel and labor consistent with the object to be\r\nattained. In many cases orchards are provided with alarm thermometers,\r\nwhich ring a bell when the temperature approaches the danger point in\r\nthe orchard.\r\n\r\nThe local prediction of frost from the readings of meteorological\r\ninstruments is a problem that has not been fully solved. The idea\r\nformerly prevailed that the temperature of the dew point, as determined\r\nfrom readings of the dry-bulb and wet-bulb thermometers in the early\r\nevening, was a safe guide to the fall of temperature to be expected\r\nduring the night, but this belief has not stood the test of accurate\r\nobservations. At the present writing certain formulas involving data\r\nof both temperature and humidity are being used experimentally by\r\nWeather Bureau specialists for predicting the lowest temperature of\r\nthe night when the general conditions indicate that frost is possible.\r\nA comprehensive discussion of this subject has been published by\r\nthe Bureau as Supplement No. 16 of the “Monthly Weather Review.”\r\n(Washington, 1920.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that the American Meteorological Society,\r\nwhich was organized in 1919, has a Committee on Commercial Meteorology.\r\nThe appointment of this committee was one of the earliest tokens of\r\nthe fact that the applications of meteorology to business, always\r\nrecognized to be important and far-reaching, had at last been\r\nsegregated as a distinct field of inquiry. The time is near at hand\r\nwhen this field will have its corps of specialists and its textbooks.\r\nCourses in commercial meteorology will be given in business colleges,\r\nand meteorologists will be attached to the staffs of large business\r\nenterprises. The chamber of commerce of a wide-awake western city\r\nalready maintains a Department of Meteorology, with a former Weather\r\nBureau official at its head, and “consulting meteorologists,” now\r\npracticing their novel profession in other parts of the country, find\r\ntheir principal clientele among business concerns.\r\n\r\nWeather not only influences most kinds of business, but is the\r\nfoundation of many of them. Plenty of illustrations of the latter fact\r\nwill be found in every large department store. Umbrellas, rubbers,\r\nand mackintoshes are made and sold because of rain; their best market\r\nis in countries with rainy climates, and their sale from day to day\r\nfluctuates with the state of the sky. Electric and palm-leaf fans\r\nare a drug on the market or the reverse, according to the readings\r\nof the thermometer. Sleds and ice skates are sold where and when the\r\nweather is cold. This list may be prolonged _ad lib_. If we leave the\r\ndepartment store and walk along any business thoroughfare, we shall\r\ndiscover other striking examples of commercial undertakings that owe\r\ntheir existence chiefly or entirely to the weather. Abolish cold\r\nweather and you abolish the dealer in furnaces and heating stoves,\r\nbesides reducing the rank of the coal-dealer considerably below the\r\n“baronial” level. Eliminate hot weather from the meteorological program\r\nand the ice dealer will likewise tumble from his high estate.\r\n\r\nAll this is so obvious that it seems hardly worth while setting down;\r\nand yet the paradox must somehow be explained that business men\r\nhave not, in general, paid much attention to meteorology, and that\r\nthey have made only fragmentary use of the official meteorological\r\nestablishments that were created, in part, for their benefit. Probably\r\nthis paradoxical situation is merely a case of mental inertia. During\r\nthe long ages of traffic before there were any weather maps, scientific\r\nweather forecasts, or climatic statistics, the weather was necessarily\r\nan unknown quantity in the mathematics of buying and selling. That it\r\nis not so to-day is a fact to which the business mind has been very\r\nslow in adjusting itself.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned some of the obvious relations of weather to commerce,\r\nbut there are others that are not so obvious. Many of these are\r\nindirect. Thus the effects of the weather on agriculture are nearly\r\nalways reflected in the commercial world. It is not the farmer alone\r\nwho suffers from a prolonged drought, for example. It has been\r\nasserted that every severe financial panic in our history has been\r\nclosely associated with a protracted period of deficient rainfall, and\r\nthat there has been no period of protracted drought without a severe\r\nfinancial panic except one that occurred during the Civil War. Mr.\r\nH. H. Clayton, who published this assertion in 1901, has cited the\r\ncase of the wheat crop as illustrating the magnitude of the effect\r\nthat rainfall exercises on economic conditions in general through its\r\neffects on agriculture.\r\n\r\n“If,” he says, “the amount of wheat raised in the United States were\r\nreduced one-half or even one-third by a year of deficient rainfall, it\r\nis easy to imagine an enormous strain on the business of the country,\r\nand with a succession of such years the effect might mean disaster.\r\nSuch a deficiency in the wheat supply, with wheat at 80 cents a bushel,\r\nwould mean for a single year a direct loss in wealth of more than\r\n$100,000,000; it would mean that nearly all the wheat which is usually\r\nshipped abroad would be needed at home; it would mean that thousands of\r\nrailroad cars and ships which ordinarily transport this grain would lie\r\nidle, that thousands of men who usually handle this grain in transport\r\nwould be out of employment, that farmers in large numbers would be\r\nunable to meet their obligations, and consequently that banks and\r\nbusiness of all kinds would suffer.” Recent prices of wheat give added\r\nforce to these statements.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such broad relations of the weather to business, it may\r\nbe interesting to point out certain relations which are of so special\r\na character that, although familiar to hosts of business men, they\r\nhave generally escaped the attention of writers on economics. On this\r\nsubject Mr. John Allen Murphy says:\r\n\r\n“Retail sales are influenced tremendously by the weather. This is one\r\nfactor that makes it impossible for a retailer to equalize the peaks\r\nand valleys in his sales chart. Favorable weather will bring him a\r\nrush of business. A bad day will keep patrons from his store. There is\r\nnothing he can do to prevent it. Many merchants have tried the plan of\r\noffering ‘stormy day specials,’ but at best such a scheme is only a\r\nmakeshift that seldom works. The weather also affects the buying moods\r\nof people. A dark, dreary day in summer seems to influence humans to\r\ntake on the same cast as the atmosphere. They are grouchy and hard\r\nto please. On the other hand, a cold day in winter has the opposite\r\neffect. The warmth and cheer of the store is such a pleasant contrast\r\nto the out-of-doors that shoppers like to linger over the wares and\r\nindulge themselves more readily in the luxury of buying.\r\n\r\n“A stormy day or a series of them always helps the mail-order business.\r\nIn such weather people are inclined to stay at home. In passing the\r\ntime, they are likely to thumb the pages of such catalogues as they\r\nhave and thus see in them articles that they want. On the farm,\r\nespecially in the bleak days of winter, it is often the custom to order\r\ngarden seeds, incubators, tools, and many other things that will be\r\nneeded as soon as spring opens up. On a bad day traveling salesmen find\r\nit easier to get the ear of a merchant. Not being busy with customers,\r\nhe is prone to be more lenient toward the ‘boys with the grips.’”\r\n\r\nAnother writer on this subject, Mr. F. C. Kelly, says:\r\n\r\n“In a large city, the business of a department store is seriously hurt\r\nby rain in the forenoon, but rain in the early afternoon is usually\r\na big help. Most customers of a big-city department store are women,\r\nand nearly all of them live some distance from the store--at the edge\r\nof the city or in the suburbs. If it rains along about eight or nine\r\no’clock in the morning, the woman who had planned to go shopping\r\nthat day is quite likely to change her mind, even though she did not\r\nintend to go until afternoon. The rain not only suggests discomfort in\r\ngetting about, but diminishes her desire or immediate need for certain\r\narticles, and drives the shopping idea out of her head. On the other\r\nhand, if it is bright and clear in the morning, but clouds up about\r\nnoon for a heavy downpour which lasts most of the afternoon, it is\r\nthe best thing that could happen for the department store, because\r\nshoppers get in and cannot comfortably get out. They shop all over the\r\nstore, buy luncheon there, and shop some more. While the rain is thus\r\nhelping the department stores, it may hurt the smaller shops, because\r\nmany customers who would otherwise look around are obliged to do their\r\nbuying all under one roof.”\r\n\r\nNo aspect of business more faithfully reflects the weather, or, in\r\na somewhat less degree, the weather forecasts, than advertising. So\r\nimportant is it, in many lines of business, to make advertising fit\r\nthe weather that one might expect merchants to be, as a class, as\r\nweather-wise as sailors and farmers. A page of advertising in a great\r\nmetropolitan newspaper is a costly investment. If, for example, it\r\ninvites the public to pay a Sunday visit of inspection to some haven\r\nfor homeseekers in the suburbs and Sunday turns out to be the kind\r\nof day that converts building-lots into bogs, the advertiser will\r\nperhaps be led to inquire whether there is not some means of avoiding\r\nanother such fiasco; and he may thus make the surprising discovery that\r\nmeteorology is not entirely a theoretical science. The conjunction of a\r\nconspicuously advertised sale of rubbers and a soppy week-day morning\r\nmay be either a lucky accident or the result of studying the weather\r\nmap. In the former case, supposing the business to be conducted in\r\nthe northeastern United States, where dry weather is about twice as\r\ncommon as wet, the odds would be two to one against the occurrence even\r\nof light showers on the day the advertisement appeared, and three or\r\nfour to one against the occurrence of such weather as would make the\r\nadvertisement decidedly _à propos_.\r\n\r\nThese remarks about newspaper advertising are, to a great extent,\r\napplicable also to the dressing of windows and the display of goods\r\ninside the shop. In both cases a moderate amount of foresight in the\r\nmatter of weather will result in placing before the customer the right\r\ngoods at the right time. One of the minor ways in which the merchant\r\ncan turn the science of meteorology to advantage consists of using\r\nmeteorological instruments and the official weather forecasts and\r\nbulletins for the purpose of attracting attention to his windows or\r\nto his stock-in-trade. The drug-store thermometer is the illustration\r\nof this process that comes first to one’s mind. There is no reason\r\nwhy, with the progress of civilization, this celebrated instrument\r\nshould not be made a trustworthy index of temperature as well as an\r\neffective advertisement. In continental Europe weather instruments are\r\ndisplayed along with miscellaneous advertising matter in many of the\r\nstreet “weather columns” (_Wettersäulen_), which furnished the idea of\r\nthe meteorological kiosks installed by the Weather Bureau in American\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important branches of commercial meteorology relates\r\nto the effects of weather upon transportation. This is a many-sided\r\nsubject. In the first place, the railway and steamship companies,\r\nand other concerns engaged in the transport of goods and passengers\r\nhave their manifold weather problems, among which one may mention,\r\nat random, that of dealing with the snow blockades of railways,\r\nprecautions against the skidding of taxicabs in wet weather, the\r\navoidance of iceberg-infested routes at sea, and the selection of\r\nclimatically favorable sites for aerodromes. The shipper has a somewhat\r\ndifferent, but overlapping set of weather problems.\r\n\r\n“In the building of railroads,” says Mr. E. L. Wells, “many phases of\r\nclimate are to be considered, including the probability of floods,\r\ndeep snows, high winds, sand storms, etc. It is not long since a\r\nconsiderable length of railroad line in one of the Western States\r\nwas found to be practically worthless because of having been built\r\ntoo near the bed of a stream and therefore being too much subject to\r\ndamage from floods, so it was replaced by a line built higher up. The\r\nwriter remembers two railroads entering the same town in one of the\r\nnorthern plains States, one of which is seldom blockaded, while the\r\nother is sometimes closed by snow for months at a time. In the former\r\ncase the cuts are parallel to the wind, while in the latter the wind\r\nblows directly across the cuts. In operating railroads a knowledge of\r\nthe climate is essential. This is particularly true in the shipment\r\nof perishable products, which may require icing or ventilation as a\r\nprotection against high temperature, or insulation against cold.\r\nNot only is a knowledge of climatic conditions essential in taking\r\nprecaution against loss in transportation, but weather records are\r\nplaying an increasingly large part in the settlement of claims for\r\nproducts and property damaged in transit. The claim agents of the\r\nleading transportation companies and the traffic managers of the\r\ncommission houses and producers’ associations keep complete files of\r\nclimatological data, and a large percentage of claims for damaged\r\ngoods, whether they be for a trainload of chilled bananas or for a\r\ntraveling man’s samples ruined by rain, are now settled out of court on\r\nthe basis of the weather records. Claims for car demurrage are often\r\nsettled on the basis of the weather reports.”\r\n\r\nDetailed information concerning the effects of temperature on all sorts\r\nof food products, both in transportation and in storage, was collected\r\nby the Weather Bureau some years ago and published as the Bureau’s\r\nBulletin No. 13.\r\n\r\nWhile the domestic shipper can easily obtain from the Weather Bureau\r\ndetailed climatic statistics for all parts of the United States, as\r\nwell as the current weather reports for this country, and can profit\r\ngreatly by regulating his operations in accordance therewith, it\r\nis not quite so easy for the shipper to foreign markets to obtain\r\nthe corresponding data of foreign countries. With the expansion\r\nof our foreign trade, the demand for such data has grown to large\r\nproportions. The Weather Bureau, which has an unrivaled meteorological\r\nand climatological library in Washington, is naturally the place\r\nwhere such data are most frequently sought, but the labor entailed in\r\nextracting and digesting the information in response to individual\r\nrequests is often too great to be undertaken by a Government office,\r\nwhere the time of the employees is absorbed in routine duties. There\r\nis, therefore, a promising field here for the private commercial\r\nmeteorologist. Unofficial work in this line is already carried on to\r\nsome extent. Thus a great steel company in New York has a salaried\r\n“consulting geographer” on its staff, who advises on meteorological\r\nquestions. One of the problems he has been called upon to solve was to\r\ndetermine the proper dates for shipping steel from Atlantic and Pacific\r\nports of the United States to various places in India, so that it would\r\nnever arrive during the monsoon rains. Records of current and very\r\nrecent weather in distant countries are, in a great majority of cases,\r\nunobtainable anywhere in the United States. The interchange of detailed\r\nweather reports between the different meteorological services of the\r\nworld involves in the first place, with few exceptions, a painfully\r\nslow process of publication, and then distribution by mail; so that,\r\nfor example, records of observations at some places in South Africa\r\nor Australia, or even many parts of Europe, do not reach the Weather\r\nBureau Library, in Washington, until two or three years after the\r\nobservations are made. Undoubtedly the time will come--and probably in\r\nthe near future--when there will be a world-wide exchange of weather\r\nnews by wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nOne kind of business wholly dependent upon the weather, which we have\r\nnot yet mentioned, is weather insurance. There are several kinds, but\r\nhail insurance and tornado insurance are those extensively practiced;\r\nthe former much more widely and systematically in the Old World than\r\nin the New, while the latter is confined to America. Insurance\r\nagainst frost is said to have been practiced in Germany, and there\r\nappears to be an excellent field for it in the United States. The\r\ninsurance of outdoor events, such as games, shows, and _al fresco_\r\nparties, against rain has been carried on for a good many years by\r\nspeculative underwriters at Lloyd’s, in England, and has more recently\r\nbeen undertaken in this country. Of course the weather element enters\r\nto a considerable degree into other kinds of insurance. Ordinary\r\nmarine insurance is, to a large extent, insurance against storms; fire\r\ninsurance is partly insurance against lightning; window and plate glass\r\ninsurance involves the risk of breakage by wind and hail; and even life\r\ninsurance is greatly concerned with the effects of weather and climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMARINE METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it behooves a sailor to be weather-wise has always been admitted,\r\nbut there was a time, almost within the memory of men now living, when\r\nneither seamen nor landsmen had the remotest conception of the benefits\r\nthat a systematic study of the meteorology of the sea was capable of\r\nconferring upon the maritime world. The man who first grasped the\r\nimportance of such a study and translated his ideas into facts was the\r\nAmerican naval officer, Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury.\r\n\r\nDuring his brief career at sea Maury became impressed with the\r\nmeagerness of the information then available concerning the winds and\r\ncurrents that aid or hinder the voyages of sailing ships. When, in\r\nconsequence of an accident that incapacitated him for shipboard duties,\r\nhe was assigned to service in Washington, he began to explore the old\r\nlogs of naval vessels, filed in the Navy Department, for notes on\r\nmeteorological conditions, and eventually developed a plan of securing\r\nregular observations from both the Navy and the merchant marine. The\r\nresult of this undertaking was the publication of the famous Wind and\r\nCurrent Charts, which revolutionized navigation throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of these charts, of which 200,000 copies were\r\ndistributed to the masters of merchant vessels of all nationalities,\r\nwas promptly recognized. By taking advantage of the favorable winds\r\nand currents shown on the charts, and avoiding those that were\r\nunfavorable, mariners were able to reduce the average time of a sailing\r\nvoyage between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States\r\nby forty days. The money value of the charts to vessels sailing from\r\nthe United States to South America and the Far East was estimated at\r\n$2,250,000 per annum. British shipping on all seas is said to have\r\nbenefited to the extent of $10,000,000 per annum. Neither was the\r\nutility of the charts limited to the saving of money. The following\r\nepisode is cited in Maury’s biography:\r\n\r\n“When the _San Francisco_, with hundreds of United States troops on\r\nboard, foundered in an Atlantic hurricane, and the rumor reached port\r\nthat she was in need of help, everyone looked to Maury as the only man\r\nin the country who could tell where to find the drifting wreck. To him\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy sent for information. He at once set to work\r\nand showed how the wind and currents acting upon a helpless wreck would\r\ncombine to drift her ‘just here’, pointing to a spot on the chart,\r\nand making a cross mark with the blue pencil he had in his hand. Just\r\nthere the relief was sent, and just there the survivors of the wreck\r\nwere picked up. This was an incidental result of his study of winds and\r\ncurrents.”\r\n\r\nA further outcome of Maury’s enterprise was the holding, at his\r\nsuggestion, and by invitation of the United States Government, of an\r\nInternational Maritime Conference, which met in Brussels in 1853,\r\nand worked out a world-wide plan for meteorological observations at\r\nsea. The work thus begun has since been carried on by the leading\r\nmaritime nations of the world. In the United States the duty of\r\ngathering weather reports on a uniform plan from vessel masters has\r\nbeen intrusted, at different times, to the Hydrographic Office, the\r\nSignal Service, and the Weather Bureau. It is now performed by the\r\nlast-named institution, through its Marine Division, but the Pilot\r\nCharts and books of sailing directions (“Pilots”) in which the compiled\r\ninformation is published, are issued by the Hydrographic Office of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nThe modern successors of Maury’s Wind and Current Charts are,\r\nespecially, the Pilot Charts for the different oceans issued monthly\r\nin Washington, and the monthly charts of similar character published\r\nby the British and German governments. Apart from these periodical\r\npublications, valuable collections of meteorological charts for oceans\r\nor smaller marine areas have been published by the British, German,\r\nDutch, Indian, Japanese and other authorities.\r\n\r\nThe value of such publications has not been lessened by the gradual\r\nsubstitution of steam for sails on ocean-going vessels. While wind is\r\nno longer all-important, it is a factor in determining the speed, and\r\nhence the earning capacity, of all classes of ocean shipping, and the\r\nsame is true of marine currents. Fog and drifting ice are, in general,\r\nmore serious obstacles to steamers than to sailing ships. A glance\r\nat one of the Hydrographic Office Pilot Charts will suffice to show\r\nthat these publications are indispensable to the mariner. On these\r\ncharts we find, first of all, in the center of each five-degree square\r\nof latitude and longitude a “wind rose” showing the frequency of the\r\nwinds that have been observed in that region from each of the cardinal\r\npoints, and their average force from each direction. On the charts\r\nwill also be found the routes recommended for full-power and low-power\r\nsteamers and sailing vessels, lines of magnetic variation, tracks of\r\nstorms in past years for the month in question, location and force of\r\ncurrents, average limits and prevalence of fog for the month, recent\r\ninformation about drifting ice and derelicts, descriptions of storm\r\nsignals, and an abundance of other information of vital importance to\r\nthe seaman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCEAN WEATHER MAP PREPARED FROM VESSEL REPORTS\r\n\r\nJAN. 11, 1913, GREENWICH MEAN NOON\r\n\r\n_U. S. Weather Bureau_\r\n\r\nSolid black lines are isobars. Arrows fly with the wind, the center of\r\nthe arrowhead marking the position of the vessel, and the number of\r\nfeathers denoting the force of the wind on the Beaufort scale. Shading\r\nof the head shows degree of cloudiness.]\r\n\r\nMost of the material used in the preparation of the charts above\r\ndescribed is obtained from a great corps of volunteer marine observers,\r\nwho enter their observations at stated hours in forms provided for\r\nthe purpose and send these records to the establishment in charge\r\nof the work at the end of each voyage. The forms furnished by the\r\nUnited States Weather Bureau prescribe only one regular observation\r\na day, to be taken at Greenwich mean noon. Each observation shows\r\nthe position of the ship, the direction of the wind, the force of\r\nthe wind on the Beaufort scale, the height of the barometer, the\r\nreadings of the dry-bulb and wet-bulb thermometers, the temperature\r\nof the water at the surface, the state of the weather, and the kind,\r\namount, and movement of clouds. In order to check the accuracy of the\r\nbarometric readings, the observer is instructed to read his barometer\r\nat prescribed hours on three successive days when in port and send the\r\nreadings to the Weather Bureau. On receipt of these readings the Bureau\r\ncompares them with those of the nearest meteorological station, and\r\nthen mails the observer a “barometer tag,” showing the results of the\r\ncomparison and the error of his instrument. Besides keeping up these\r\nroutine observations, the observer keeps a record of fog encountered\r\nat any hour of the day and makes detailed reports on storms. Many\r\nmarine observers also report observations at stated hours by wireless\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\nThe enormous fund of information thus collected over the ocean is\r\napplied to several purposes besides the construction of Pilot Charts.\r\nOur Weather Bureau and certain foreign meteorological institutions\r\nprepare daily charts, showing approximately the instantaneous\r\nconditions over great oceanic areas, especially the North Atlantic.\r\nThese maps are analogous to the daily weather maps published for land\r\nareas, but the drawing of each map is, necessarily, delayed for\r\nseveral months after the date to which it refers, in order to allow\r\ntime for the receipt of as many reports as possible from ships at sea.\r\nAs a rule such charts are prepared in manuscript only, but, though they\r\ncannot be distributed after the manner of ordinary weather maps, they\r\nare valuable for studies in the institution itself on the movements\r\nof storms and other atmospheric processes. They also enable the\r\nmeteorological officials to answer inquiries concerning the winds and\r\nweather that have prevailed over a particular part of the ocean on any\r\nspecified date. Such inquiries come from vessel owners, underwriters,\r\nand others, and the replies are frequently used as evidence in\r\nadmiralty suits.\r\n\r\nIn the case of one series of such maps--viz., the daily synoptic\r\ncharts of the North Atlantic, begun by Niels Hoffmeyer, of Copenhagen,\r\nand now prepared jointly by the Danish Meteorological Institute and\r\nthe Deutsche Seewarte, in Hamburg--the charts have actually been\r\npublished and sold, though they are so costly that the number of sets\r\nin libraries throughout the world is probably small. These remarkable\r\ncharts present daily pictures of the winds and barometric pressure over\r\nthe North Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent continents from 1873 to 1876,\r\nand from 1880 down to a recent date.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have already said it will be seen that the marine\r\nobservers cooperating with the United States Weather Bureau and kindred\r\ninstitutions abroad are all contributing toward the great task of\r\nrecording the history of the weather over the oceans from day to day\r\nand assembling data that can be digested in the form of marine climatic\r\nstatistics and used as the basis for many scientific investigations.\r\nThis concerted undertaking does not, however, constitute the whole\r\nscope of marine meteorology. Every intelligent mariner finds it\r\nnecessary to acquaint himself with the laws of the winds, indications\r\nof coming storms, means of determining the proximity of icebergs, the\r\nsystems of storm signals used in different countries, the method of\r\nconstructing weather maps from wireless bulletins, etc. He ought, in\r\nshort, to become an accomplished meteorologist.\r\n\r\nOne of the classic problems of the navigator is that of handling his\r\nship in a violent cyclonic storm, especially a tropical hurricane. The\r\nreader will recall that a cyclone, besides traveling as a whole at a\r\nrate of several hundred miles a day, consists of a system of winds\r\nrotating around the center. The result of this double motion is that\r\nthe winds on one side of the center are not only more violent than\r\nthose on the other, but they are also so directed as to drive a vessel\r\nrunning before the wind, across the storm track ahead of the advancing\r\ncenter, while those on the other side tend to drive a vessel to the\r\nrear of the storm. The two halves of the storm area are accordingly\r\nknown as the “dangerous” and “navigable” semicircles, respectively.\r\nWhile this simple statement sets forth the fundamental facts involved,\r\nthe actual problem is complicated by many features, such as the fact\r\nthat the winds do not blow in circles, but more or less spirally, that\r\nthe area of the storm cannot be readily determined, that two storms may\r\noccur in close proximity to each other, etc.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram, published by the United States Hydrographic\r\nOffice, represents a cyclonic storm in the northern hemisphere, the\r\ncircles being isobars, or lines passing through places at which the\r\nsame barometric pressure prevails (indicated in inches), and the arrows\r\nindicating the direction of the winds. The diagram is thus explained:\r\n\r\n“For simplicity the area of low barometer is made perfectly circular\r\nand the center is assumed to be ten points to the right of the\r\ndirection of the wind at all points within the disturbed area. Let\r\nus assume that the center is advancing about north-northeast, in the\r\ndirection of the long arrow, shown in the heavy full line. The ship _a_\r\nhas the wind at east-northeast; she is to the left of the storm track,\r\nor technically in the navigable semicircle. The ship _b_ has the wind\r\nat east-southeast and is in the dangerous semicircle.***A vessel hove\r\nto at the position marked _b_, and being passed by the storm center,\r\nwill occupy successive positions in regard to the center from _b_ to\r\n_b_4, and will experience shifts of the wind, as shown by the arrows,\r\nfrom east through south to southwest. On the other hand, if the storm\r\ncenter be stationary or moving slowly and a vessel be overtaking it\r\nalong the line from _b_4 to _b_, the wind will back from southwest to\r\neast, and is likely to convey an entirely wrong impression as to the\r\nlocation and movement of the center. Hence it is recommended that a\r\nvessel suspecting the approach of proximity of a cyclonic storm should\r\nstop for a while until the path of the center is located by observing\r\nthe shifts of the wind and the behavior of the barometer.”\r\n\r\nThe movement of the winds around the storm center shown in this diagram\r\nis that of cyclones of the northern hemisphere; i. e., contrary to the\r\ndirection of the clock hands. In the southern hemisphere they blow in\r\nthe opposite direction around the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAVIGATION OF A SHIP IN A CYCLONIC STORM\r\n\r\n(_U. S. Hydrographic Office._)]\r\n\r\nBy observing the rise or fall of the barometer, the shift of the\r\nwinds, and the state of the sea and sky, the experienced navigator\r\nis generally able to lay down on a chart the approximate position of\r\nthe storm center and steer his vessel so as to avoid danger. Various\r\ndevices, known as “storm cards,” “cyclonoscopes,” etc., have been used\r\nto aid in the process of locating a storm from shipboard observations.\r\nIn the Far East mariners use for locating typhoons an ingenious\r\ncombination of the storm card and the aneroid barometer, called the\r\n“barocyclonometer,” an invention of the Rev. J. Algué, director of the\r\nPhilippine Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe most important development in marine meteorology in recent years\r\nhas been the rapidly increasing use of radiotelegraphy, both by marine\r\nobservers in transmitting reports of observations to shore and to other\r\nships, and by meteorological institutions in issuing weather bulletins\r\nand storm warnings to vessels at sea. The first regular undertaking\r\nin this line was carried out under the auspices of the London _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ in the year 1904. This newspaper arranged with some of\r\nthe leading transatlantic steamship lines to furnish weather reports\r\nby wireless from their vessels, and these reports were published in\r\nits columns for several months. The following year the United States\r\nWeather Bureau began, in a tentative way, the collection of wireless\r\nweather reports from off-shore vessels, and similar undertakings were\r\nsoon afterward launched in other parts of the world, but for some years\r\nsuch reports were of little practical value, owing to the limited range\r\nof wireless communication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHIPBOARD WEATHER MAP\r\n\r\nVessels off the American coast can make their own weather maps every\r\nnight, using data supplied at fixed hours by high-power radio stations\r\n(shown by stars on the map), together with radio reports from other\r\nvessels. Letters near stations are the code letters used in wireless\r\nbulletins to describe the stations. Vessel reports are indicated by\r\nnames. Arrows show direction of wind and the force on the Beaufort\r\nscale (shown by the number of feathers). Besides data for constructing\r\nmaps, the radio stations issue forecasts and storm reports for each of\r\nthe numbered zones shown off the Atlantic coast and over the Gulf.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time wireless reports from ships on the Atlantic enable\r\nthe forecasters on both sides of that ocean to extend the areas of\r\nthe weather maps on which their predictions are based, and reports\r\nfrom ships are also received to a limited extent by forecasters on our\r\nPacific coast as well as in the Far East, India, and elsewhere. In\r\nthis country such reports have been especially valuable in indicating\r\nthe movements of West India hurricanes, and thus have helped to solve\r\nthe problem of protecting the vast tonnage that has been attracted\r\nto Caribbean waters by the opening of the Panama Canal. The reciprocal\r\nprocess of transmitting weather intelligence to vessels by wireless\r\nbulletins, broadcasted at certain hours every day by high-powered\r\nradio stations, has made much more progress. Such bulletins include\r\ninformation concerning the current and prospective weather, winds and\r\nstorms over specified ocean areas, as well as reports of observations\r\nmade at a number of land stations, from which it is possible for\r\nvessels at sea to construct their own weather maps. They are thus\r\nenabled to take advantage of favorable winds and to avoid unfavorable\r\nwinds and storms. Wireless weather reports from other vessels help to\r\npiece out these shipboard maps.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological services of all civilized countries adjacent to\r\nthe sea display signals along their coasts to announce the coming of\r\nstorms dangerous to navigation. One of the earliest devices used for\r\nthis purpose was the “aeroclinoscope,” a form of semaphore formerly\r\nemployed by the meteorological service of Holland. The position of the\r\narm of the semaphore indicated the region in which the barometer was\r\nlow; i. e., the storm center. In the British Isles, in the middle of\r\nthe last century, Admiral FitzRoy introduced the use of canvas cones\r\nand “drums” (i. e., cylinders), which, seen from any direction, have\r\nthe appearance of solid triangles and squares against the background of\r\nthe sky. The British later abandoned the drum and used the cone only,\r\npointing up or down for northerly or southerly gales, respectively.\r\nThe American storm flag--red with a square, black center--was adopted\r\nby the United States Signal Service (the predecessor of the Weather\r\nBureau) in 1871. This signal was subsequently amplified by the addition\r\nof red and white pennants to show the expected direction of the wind\r\nat the beginning of the approaching storm. Most countries use lanterns\r\nfor night storm signals. In the year 1909 a uniform system of signals,\r\nconsisting of cones by day and lanterns by night, was recommended for\r\nuse in all countries by an international commission which met in London.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this recommendation some thirty or forty different systems\r\nof daytime storm signals are now in use in different parts of the\r\nworld. On the China coast an elaborate system of signals, consisting of\r\ncones, balls, diamonds, and squares displayed on a mast and yardarms,\r\nindicates the existence of a typhoon anywhere in the neighboring seas,\r\ntogether with its location and movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAERONAUTICAL METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the great war the British Government decided, in its wisdom,\r\nto establish a flying field in Scotland, at which aviators were to be\r\ntrained in dropping bombs. The commission having this matter in hand\r\nchose a site on the shores of Loch Doon. In laying out the field a\r\nbog had to be drained; then a railway was constructed, hangars were\r\nerected, and other operations were carried out, entailing altogether an\r\nexpenditure of half a million pounds. At a certain late stage in the\r\nproceedings the disconcerting discovery was made that the field could\r\nnever be successfully used for the purpose intended, on account of the\r\ngusts and eddies produced by the surrounding hills. The undertaking\r\nwas therefore abandoned. The authorities had presumably enlisted the\r\nskill of engineers from the outset of the work--but they had failed to\r\nconsult a meteorologist!\r\n\r\nA few such object lessons seem to be necessary to demonstrate the\r\nfact--which ought to be obvious--that meteorology is an indispensable\r\nand vital adjunct of aeronautics. This fact is now pretty well\r\nunderstood. Nearly all the activities of mankind are more or\r\nless influenced by weather, but few, if any, to such an extent\r\nas aeronautical enterprises. Hence a definite branch of applied\r\nscience--Aeronautical Meteorology--is rapidly taking shape. Already it\r\nenters into the curriculum of aeronauts; it has profoundly modified the\r\nmethods of the ordinary meteorological services of the world; and it\r\nis raising a crop of specialists, some of whom are now employed by the\r\nbusiness firms that manufacture or operate aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe statement has constantly been made since the war that aeronauts\r\nare becoming “independent” of the weather. This statement has a grain\r\nof truth in it, but no more. It is a fact that, under war conditions,\r\naviators flew in every sort of weather, and often with impunity. Even\r\nsince the war commercial aircraft have negotiated adverse atmospheric\r\nconditions with remarkable success. A spectacular feat of this sort was\r\nachieved on August 28, 1919, when a passenger-carrying aeroplane on the\r\nParis-London route, piloted by Lieutenant Shaw, flew over this route\r\nthrough a hurricane blowing in gusts of from 40 to over 100 miles an\r\nhour, accompanied by a torrential rainstorm and such poor visibility\r\nthat the pilot was frequently obliged to fly very low in order to pick\r\nup his landmarks and make sure that he was on his course. The flight\r\nwas accomplished in 1 hour and 50 minutes--about half an hour less than\r\nschedule time. It is said that “the two passengers in the cabin of the\r\nmachine emerged without any appearance at all of strain”--such as they\r\ncertainly would have experienced if they had made the crossing by the\r\nChannel steamer on that boisterous day. In fact the land and sea route\r\nwas seriously disorganized by the storm, and the Continental trains\r\nwere arriving in London hours late.\r\n\r\nLest hasty conclusions should be drawn from this episode it should be\r\nstated at once that the company operating the air route in question,\r\nfar from considering itself independent of weather, is not content\r\nwith the detailed bulletins furnished to aeronauts by the British\r\nMeteorological Office (which specializes in aeronautical meteorology\r\nmore extensively than any other official weather service in the world),\r\nbut maintains an elaborate weather service of its own, with an able\r\nmeteorologist at the head of it.\r\n\r\nAn accurate statement of the situation would be that wind and weather\r\nare no longer the grave dangers that they once were to the aeronaut;\r\nbut they are still, and will probably always be, factors of the utmost\r\nimportance in the successful and profitable operation of aircraft. In\r\norder to make this matter plain it will be necessary for us, first\r\nof all, to devote a few words to some of the fundamental principles\r\ninvolved in aerial navigation.\r\n\r\nThe layman who sees nothing mysterious in the ascent of a balloon is,\r\nin general, somewhat puzzled by the phenomenon of a heavier-than-air\r\nmachine rising from the ground. Yet, in both cases, the ascent of the\r\nvehicle depends upon the fact that air is not just empty space, but a\r\nmaterial substance, possessing density, weight, and other properties\r\nmany of which pertain also to solids. A balloon rises not because\r\nit is light, but because the air about it is heavy. In other words,\r\ngravity pushes the air under the balloon more forcibly than it pulls\r\nthe balloon downward. The ability of an aeroplane to leave the ground\r\ndepends upon the fact that air offers resistance to bodies moving\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n        A                                B\r\n        |                                   /\r\n        |                                  /\r\n        |                                 /\r\n  ------|------->                 -------/------>\r\n        |                               /\r\n        |                              /\r\n        |                             /\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF AIR RESISTANCE ON AN AEROPLANE]\r\n\r\nSuppose a vertical plane (A)--such, for example, as the wind shield\r\nof an automobile--is moving horizontally through still air. The\r\nresistance of the air impedes its motion, and a part of the motive\r\npower is employed in overcoming this resistance. Now, suppose the\r\nplane (B) is nearly, but not quite, horizontal, and is propelled by a\r\nforce tending to make it move in the direction indicated by the arrow.\r\nThis is approximately the case of an aeroplane driven by a motor; the\r\nplane representing the wings of the machine. Only a part of the air’s\r\nresistance is now effective in impeding the forward motion of the\r\nplane. The rest of it pushes the plane upward. If you hold your hand\r\nat such an angle and move it through water you will feel an analogous\r\nupward push. Moreover, you will notice that the faster you move your\r\nhand the greater is the push. Not only does this upward pressure of\r\na fluid upon an inclined plane moving through it vary with the speed\r\nof the latter (to be exact, as the square of the speed), but it also\r\nvaries with the angle which the plane presents to the fluid in its\r\npath. If the wing of an aeroplane, for example, cuts the air nearly\r\nedgewise, the upward pressure will be slight. As it departs from an\r\nedgewise position, (with the front edge higher than the rear), the\r\nupward pressure increases, but not indefinitely; beyond a certain\r\nrather small angle it begins to diminish.\r\n\r\nIn an aeroplane the upward pressure, or “lift,” is increased by giving\r\nthe wings a slightly arched shape, or “camber.” The air flows over the\r\narched wings in such a way as to produce a suction above them which\r\nhelps the push from below. The actual amount of lift for a given speed\r\nhas been determined by experiments for wings of various shapes and\r\nsizes and set at various angles to the line of motion. If, when the\r\nmachine is in the air, the lift is just sufficient to counterbalance\r\nthe weight of the aeroplane, the latter flies horizontally. An increase\r\nin lift causes the machine to rise; a decrease in lift permits gravity\r\nto pull it down.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the aviator is flying horizontally and wishes to climb.\r\nAt the rear of the machine and forming part of its tail is a hinged\r\nhorizontal flap called the “elevator,” under the control of the pilot.\r\nBy giving this flap an upward tilt he causes the air to exert a\r\ndownward pressure on the tail of the machine, and hence the nose of the\r\nmachine is carried upward. While the inertia of the aeroplane tends to\r\ncarry it along the original path, its wings now present a greater angle\r\nto the air, the lift is increased, and the machine rises. The reverse\r\nof this operation will cause the machine to descend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BED OF POTOMAC RIVER, AT WASHINGTON.

Two or more small horizontal flaps, known as “ailerons,”\r\nattached to the wings, are used to preserve the lateral balance of the\r\nmachine, and to give it the proper “bank,” or inclination, when making\r\na turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING WITH COMPRESSED AIR IN A COPPER MINE.

S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\nWith these few details in mind, we shall be prepared to consider, in a\r\ngeneral way, how the behavior of an aeroplane is affected by the wind\r\nand other atmospheric phenomena.\r\n\r\nWith respect to wind there is an important difference between aircraft\r\nand marine craft. Mere strength of wind is not dangerous to an\r\naeroplane, except when starting or landing. An aviator flying above the\r\nclouds, with no landmarks in sight by which to gauge his movements,\r\nis no more conscious of the actual wind at that level, provided it is\r\nsteady, than he is of the rotation of the earth on its axis. He feels\r\nthe wind produced by the motion of his machine through the air--the\r\nso-called “relative wind”--but no other. The true wind may be a mere\r\nzephyr, or a hurricane blowing 150 miles an hour; the effect is the\r\nsame on his machine, so far as he is able to observe. On the other\r\nhand, a strong wind has a very different effect from a light one\r\nupon the course of the aeroplane’s flight with respect to the ground\r\nbeneath. If a pilot, with no landmarks to guide him, steers by compass\r\nfor a certain point, and if there is a strong cross-wind of which he is\r\nunaware, he will be carried far out of his course; a wind dead ahead\r\nor astern will merely affect the speed of his flight, so that he will\r\narrive later or sooner at his destination than he expected.\r\n\r\nOne of the important problems of aeronautics, especially from the\r\ncommercial point of view, is to prevent aircraft from being driven\r\noff their course by the wind when flying with no visible landmarks;\r\ni. e., over clouds, fog, the ocean, or an unmapped country. When this\r\nproblem is solved, pilots will fly above the clouds much more commonly\r\nthan they do now. The winds at high levels are generally both steadier\r\nand stronger than at low. The stronger wind is an advantage or a\r\ndisadvantage, according to whether it is blowing in the direction of\r\nflight or the reverse; but as the winds at different levels generally\r\nblow in different directions, a pilot who is independent of landmarks\r\ncan choose whatever level affords the winds most favorable for his\r\nintended journey.\r\n\r\nOver established air routes quite elaborate measures are now adopted\r\nto keep pilots informed of the direction and speed of the wind at\r\ndifferent levels, so that they can make due allowance for this factor\r\nin shaping their course. In clear weather this information is easily\r\nobtained by sighting the drift of a pilot balloon with a theodolite,\r\nor by observing in a specially designed graduated mirror or pair\r\nof mirrors the drift of the smoke cloud from a shell fired by an\r\nanti-aircraft gun and timed to burst at any desired altitude. In cloudy\r\nweather the smoke trails can often be successfully observed through\r\nsmall breaks in the clouds. When the sky is completely overcast, a\r\nsuccession of shells is fired at definite short intervals of time and\r\nthe distances apart of the puffs of smoke and the direction of the\r\nline in which they lie are determined from an aeroplane flying above\r\nthe spot. Another method, which was devised by the French military\r\nmeteorological service during the war, is to send up small balloons\r\nloaded with bombs which burst after a certain time, the position of\r\neach burst being determined by sound-ranging from the ground.\r\n\r\nThese methods of providing information concerning the winds at flying\r\nlevels have, however, their serious limitations, and aeronauts now look\r\nhopefully to the perfection of the existing systems of “directional\r\nwireless,” whereby the pilot will receive whenever desired, or at\r\nregular intervals, a wireless signal from the terminus of his route or\r\nsome other known point, the direction from which the signal comes being\r\nindicated by suitable apparatus on the aeroplane. Thus aided, he should\r\nnever deviate far from his course, unless he chooses to.\r\n\r\nFor long journeys, such as the crossing of the Atlantic, the air pilot\r\nwill naturally make use of all available information concerning the\r\ngreat permanent or semipermanent wind systems of the earth, such as the\r\ntrade winds of the lower atmosphere, the antitrades above them, and\r\nthe fairly constant eastward drift of the atmosphere at high levels\r\nin middle latitudes. The dividend-earning capacity of commercial\r\naircraft necessarily depends upon taking advantage of favorable\r\nwinds, while adverse winds may mean not only a loss of money but the\r\ndanger of prolonging a journey until the fuel supply is exhausted--a\r\nserious predicament over the ocean and also over lands remote from\r\ncivilization. It is, however, a common error on the part of current\r\nwriters to overrate the constancy and reliability of the winds in\r\nvarious parts of the world, and to lay too much stress on the value\r\nof permanent wind charts. What the aeronaut needs especially to know\r\nis the typical behavior of the winds with respect to the distribution\r\nof barometric pressure, as shown by a weather map, including their\r\nvariations with altitude. The time will come when the information\r\nnecessary for plotting the winds at various levels will be flashed at\r\nfrequent intervals by high-powered radio stations to aerial navigators\r\nin all parts of the world--a system that is already in its initial\r\nstages, especially in Europe. A pilot making a long journey will thus\r\nbe able to lay his course so as to utilize the winds that will speed\r\nhim on his way. Even violent storms, such as the mariner seeks to\r\navoid, will be turned to advantage by the airman.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider another aspect of wind that is of much more\r\ninterest to the airman than to the seaman, and that is the question\r\nof “wind structure.” The layman usually thinks of a wind as a nearly\r\nsteady horizontal flow of air. Such winds exist, but they are\r\nexceptional, especially in the lower levels of the atmosphere. A wind\r\nis generally full of gusts and eddies, upcurrents and downcurrents,\r\nand it is these eccentricities that gradually develop in the aviator\r\na sort of sixth sense--a “feel” for atmospheric fluctuations, that\r\nenables him to adjust his machine instinctively to the forces tending\r\nto disturb its equilibrium. He also learns by experience the conditions\r\nunder which irregularities of a pronounced character may be expected.\r\nHe becomes well acquainted with the great mound of air that drives his\r\nmachine upward when passing over a hill or mountain; with the eddy that\r\nlurks in the lee of such an obstacle; with the downward tendency of the\r\nair over lakes, rivers, swamps and forests.\r\n\r\n“The air is so sensitive,” writes the late well-known British flyer,\r\nGustav Hamel, “that it is affected even by the color of large patches\r\nof vegetation. Whether this be entirely due to the different\r\nheat-radiating power of different colors it is impossible to say, but\r\ninvariably an aeroplane on passing from grass land to a field covered\r\nwith yellow flowers experiences a certain amount of air disturbances\r\nonly less noticeable than the inevitable bump experienced in passing\r\nfrom green fields to ploughed land, or from ploughed land to meadow.”\r\n\r\nWhen the wind is blowing, the air for at least a few hundred feet above\r\nthe ground is nearly always in a state of turmoil. This is partly due\r\nto the friction of the moving fluid against the irregular surface of\r\nthe earth, and partly to the ascending and descending currents caused\r\nby differences in temperature. The latter effect is illustrated in\r\nthe rapid rise of air over a bare sunlit plain and its fall over an\r\nadjacent forest or body of water. Ascending currents are often made\r\nvisible by the formation of detached cumulus clouds, each of which\r\nmarks the summit of a rising column of moist air, while in the spaces\r\nbetween the clouds the air is generally sinking. Measurements with\r\nballoons have shown that vertical currents often attain speeds of 600\r\nfeet a minute or more, while the process of hail formation appears\r\nto indicate that in thunderstorm clouds there are violent uprushes\r\namounting to 2,000 or 2,500 feet a minute, and possibly much more. The\r\ndescending air current between clouds is sometimes so strong that an\r\naeroplane cannot force its way up through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLOW OF AIR OVER TWO RIDGES\r\n\r\n(_After Dr. Franz Linke._)\r\n\r\nNotice the eddy in the valley to the leeward of the first ridge]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHELTERED LANDING PLACE MAY BE DANGEROUS\r\n\r\n(_After Dr. Franz Linke._)\r\n\r\nA landing place surrounded by trees is dangerous in windy weather on\r\naccount of the air waves formed between the moving air above and the\r\ncalm air below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIR WAVES NEAR THE EARTH’S SURFACE\r\n\r\nThe waves are made visible by smoke]\r\n\r\nThe turbulence of the lower air--a phenomenon that adds so much to\r\nthe difficulties of starting and landing--extends to various heights,\r\ndepending especially upon the strength of the wind. A rough rule,\r\nevolved by the Zeppelin pilots before the war, was to expect turbulent\r\nconditions up to an altitude equal to from ten to twenty times the\r\nforce of the wind in meters per second. Thus, for a wind of 10 meters\r\nper second, the turbulent layer would be from 100 to 200 meters thick.\r\nA good picture of the atmospheric ups and downs encountered by the\r\nairman when flying low is furnished by the behavior of the smoke from\r\na factory chimney with a moderate wind blowing, forming smoke waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIND’S AUTOGRAPH ON A GUSTY DAY, RECORDED WITH A\r\nPRESSURE-TUBE ANEMOMETER\r\n\r\nThe vertical lines are hour lines and the horizontal lines show the\r\nforce of the wind in miles an hour and also in pounds a square foot.]\r\n\r\nThese disturbances give rise to the very marked fluctuations in the\r\nforce of the wind known as gusts. There are certain forms of anemometer\r\nespecially designed to record the gustiness of the wind. A record of\r\nthe wind’s force is traced by a pen on a moving strip of paper, and the\r\n“anemogram” thus obtained shows a continuous series of irregularities,\r\nthe extent of which increases with the strength of the wind. The puffs\r\nand lulls often alternate at intervals of a few seconds or less, and\r\nthe actual force of the wind at a given instant may be many times\r\ngreater than its average force for, say, five minutes. An ordinary\r\nanemometer does not indicate these rapid fluctuations, but merely shows\r\nthe time required for a mile of wind to flow past the instrument. Thus\r\nwhen such an instrument tells us that the wind is blowing at the rate\r\nof 40 miles an hour, it may actually be varying between 20 and 60\r\nmiles an hour, or between even wider limits.\r\n\r\nSince the matter became of practical importance on account of the\r\nneeds of aviation, many interesting studies have been made of the\r\neffects of different kinds of topography upon the overlying air\r\ncurrents. A striking example of the eccentric winds that sometimes\r\nprevail in mountain valleys has been described by Mr. B. M. Varney,\r\nof the University of California, in the “Monthly Weather Review.”\r\nFrom the summit of a steep cliff about 1,100 feet above the floor of\r\nYosemite Valley the writer launched broad sheets of tissue paper, and,\r\nwith the aid of powerful binoculars, followed their flight as they\r\nwere carried in huge spirals, thousands of feet in diameter, finally\r\ndisappearing beyond the mountains on the opposite side of the valley.\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows the path of one of these papers. From its\r\nstarting point at _A_ until it passed behind the summit of Liberty Cap\r\n(_B_), more than a mile distant, the paper was watched for 7 minutes.\r\nThe top of Liberty Cap is some 1,600 feet above the point at which the\r\nflight began. This sketch visualizes one of the ticklish problems that\r\nwill some day confront the pilot of a sight-seeing or mail-carrying\r\naeroplane in the Yosemite National Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIR CURRENTS IN YOSEMITE VALLEY\r\n\r\n(_Sketched by B. M. Varney._)\r\n\r\nThe flight of a sheet of paper across the valley.]\r\n\r\nAlthough, on an average, the air is much steadier at high levels than\r\nnear the ground, very unsteady currents are sometimes found at all\r\naltitudes attainable by aircraft. Thunderclouds, thousands of feet\r\nabove the earth, are always the seat of violent turmoil, but such\r\nclouds can, as a rule, be avoided by the airman. When a stratum of air\r\nglides over another differing sharply from it in density--and distinct\r\nstrata of this sort are not uncommon in the atmosphere--friction\r\nbetween the strata sets up waves like those produced in water by wind\r\nblowing over it. If the two streams are moving in the same direction,\r\nbut at different speeds, the waves are long and regular; when they are\r\nmore or less crossed, the waves are short and choppy. The moisture\r\nat the crests of these waves may be cooled to such an extent as to\r\ncondense into visible clouds, arranged in long continuous rolls or rows\r\nof detached patches; forms frequently assumed by cirro-cumulus and\r\nalto-cumulus. More often, however, the waves of air remain invisible,\r\nbecause the conditions of moisture and temperature are not right for\r\nthe production of cloud.\r\n\r\nRecalling, now, what has been said above about the way in which the\r\nlift of an aeroplane varies with the angle at which the wings meet\r\nthe air and also with the speed of the machine relative to the air,\r\nit will be easy to understand some of the difficulties experienced in\r\nmaintaining one’s equilibrium when flying in a turbulent atmosphere.\r\nWaves, eddies, vertical currents and other features of wind structure\r\ncause abrupt changes in the attitude and the speed of the machine with\r\nrespect to the air stream. The sudden increases and decreases of lift\r\nthus produced have much the same effect upon the machine as if it\r\nwere running over a solid obstacle on the one hand or plunging into\r\na vacuous space in the atmosphere on the other, and hence are aptly\r\ndescribed by aviators as “bumps” and “holes in the air,” respectively.\r\nThe latter term, which seems to have become firmly rooted in all\r\nlanguages (French, _trou d’air_; German, _Luftloch_; etc.), has had\r\nthe unfortunate effect of keeping alive in the public mind the idea\r\nthat the aviator occasionally runs into a vacuum or semivacuum, such\r\nas could not exist in the atmosphere. (The nearest approach to such a\r\nthing is the rarefaction in the core of a tornado or waterspout, due to\r\nthe enormous centrifugal force of the vortex; something that no aviator\r\nhas yet encountered.)\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, different parts of the sustaining surface of\r\nthe machine may receive different impulses. One wing, for example, may\r\ngraze a violent uprush of air not encountered by the other, giving\r\nthe aeroplane a tilt to one side, or the tail of the machine may be\r\ndriven in one direction and the nose in the other. Again, the whole\r\nmachine may suddenly enter an air current of quite different speed and\r\ndirection from the one in which it has been flying. To take an extreme\r\ncase, it may run into a stream of air flowing just as fast, and in\r\nthe same direction, as the machine itself, with the result that the\r\n_relative_ wind becomes zero, and the machine, deprived of all lift,\r\ndrops like a stone until it acquires a velocity with respect to its new\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nWhen such conditions prevail, the pilot is kept busy with his\r\n“controls”; now moving his elevator to adjust his fore-and-aft balance,\r\nand now his ailerons to set him on an even keel laterally, and\r\noccasionally turning his rudder to offset the effects of horizontal\r\ngusts. The elevator and the ailerons are worked with a single lever,\r\ncolloquially called the “joy-stick,” and the rudder with a bar which\r\nthe pilot operates with his feet. Ordinary adjustments of this kind\r\nare performed automatically by the trained aviator, but violent\r\ndisturbances call for the exercise of skill and judgment. Generally\r\nspeaking, no amount of atmospheric turbulence causes any serious\r\ntrouble to the trained pilot, except when he is flying close to the\r\nground, as in starting and landing.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the subject of wind it will be well to emphasize once\r\nmore the fact, which the average layman has difficulty in grasping,\r\nthat the only movements of the air that affect the safety and comfort\r\nof flight are the movements relative to the machine, and not those\r\nrelative to the ground. To the aviator, when he is once clear of the\r\nground, a steady wind of any speed is merely a mass of calm air. Hence\r\nan aviator will sometimes have perfectly smooth flying when the wind,\r\nas measured on the earth, is blowing 40 or 50 miles an hour; and again\r\nhe will describe the air as rough and bumpy when flags are hanging\r\nlimp from their staffs and dwellers on _terra firma_ declare that not\r\na breath of air is stirring. In the early days of flying aviators\r\nthemselves were afraid of a strong wind. Thus Wilbur Wright, during\r\nhis pioneer exhibition flights in France, would never go up unless the\r\nsmoke from his cigarette rose in a straight line, and until about the\r\nend of 1909 no aviator attempted to fly in a wind of 20 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the only atmospheric condition that seriously\r\nhampers flying is fog or low cloud. An aviator flying in a fog or cloud\r\nis not only liable to wander far from his course, on account of the\r\nunknown leeway of his machine, but he is often in great doubt as to his\r\nproximity to the ground. One of the curious effects of such a situation\r\nis that the airman loses his sense of the vertical. On land our sense\r\nof up and down is determined by the force of gravity, pulling us toward\r\nthe earth. When riding in a terrestrial vehicle, we are conscious of\r\nother pushes and pulls; such, for example, as the jolt that pitches\r\nus forward when a train stops suddenly, or the outward thrust that we\r\nfeel when swinging around a curve. Again, in descending in a lift we\r\nseem to lose weight, as if gravity had suddenly grown weaker. On earth\r\nall such impressions are corrected by the sight of objects around us;\r\nbut the aviator enveloped in mist has no such guides, and he often\r\nbecomes quite confused about the direction of the ground. A turn, which\r\ninvolves banking, increases his confusion. Eventually he may be flying\r\nalmost upside down without being aware of the fact. Professor Melville\r\nJones, who has been through such experiences, says of the pilot’s\r\nconfusion:\r\n\r\n“His first indication that something is wrong is, as a rule, either\r\nan increase or a decrease of speed that is not counteracted by the\r\naccustomed movements of the controls. A period of wild suspense and\r\nutter bewilderment now follows, during which the pilot makes violent\r\nefforts to recover control, but without success. The next thing that he\r\nrealizes, if he realizes anything at all, is that he is either on his\r\nback or spinning, and the next thing he knows is that he is out of the\r\nclouds with the earth standing up at a ridiculous angle and spinning\r\nround like a drunken dinner plate. Happy is he that has plenty of air\r\nroom under these circumstances.”\r\n\r\nSpirit-levels and similar instruments are affected by the same\r\ndisturbances that mislead the pilot in his estimation of the vertical;\r\nbut fortunately there are certain other devices, due to the exigencies\r\nof the war, during which cloud flying was a part of the tactics of the\r\nmilitary aviator, which have virtually solved this problem, though\r\ntheir use has not yet become general.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding difficulty of a fog is the problem of landing. In the\r\ncase of a forced landing, at a distance from a regular landing-ground,\r\nthe pilot must simply trust to luck. He may descend in the water or the\r\ntreetops, or on rough ground that will wreck his machine, but he has no\r\nchoice. The only solution of this difficulty is the installation of a\r\nreserve engine, or some other expedient that will obviate the necessity\r\nof forced landings. The task of finding a landing ground in a fog and\r\ndescending to it in safety will, in the near future, be comparatively\r\nsimple. Most fogs, though by no means all, are so shallow that it is\r\npossible to tether a kite-balloon so that it will float above the fog\r\nand indicate the position of the aerial harbor. Several such balloons,\r\nflying tandem, would afford sufficient lift to support a series of\r\nelectric lanterns along the cable, for use at night. Searchlights and\r\n“star shells” have been employed for the same purpose. Directional\r\nwireless and the wireless telephone seem likely, however, to be the\r\nchief dependence of the future aeronaut seeking port in a fog. These\r\ndevices will also be the means of averting collisions in a fog or cloud\r\nalong crowded airways, and especially in the congestion that will\r\nprevail in the vicinity of important air ports. Last but not least,\r\nthe artificial dispersion of fog by means of electrical discharges,\r\nalthough still in the experimental stage, holds out possibilities\r\nof being the ultimate solution of the fog problem, not only for the\r\naeronaut, but also for the mariner, the railway manager, and everybody\r\nelse who is incommoded by a misty atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEven when he is not flying in clouds or fog the aviator by no means\r\nalways enjoys a clear view of distant objects. A slight haze impairs\r\nvisibility, while a heavy rainstorm or snowstorm may obstruct the\r\naeronaut’s view as badly as a fog.\r\n\r\nOf the meteorological elements that affect aeronautics, other than\r\nthose we have mentioned, the most important is the density of the\r\natmosphere--generally expressed in terms of barometric pressure. The\r\nair diminishes in density upward, and the rarefied atmosphere of high\r\nlevels has several effects on aircraft. Its decreased buoyancy imposes\r\na limit upon the ascent of balloons; its decreased resistance makes\r\nit necessary for an aeroplane to fly at greater speed in order to get\r\nthe same lift; it diminishes the power of gasoline engines, on account\r\nof the reduced supply of air; and it has various unpleasant and even\r\ndangerous effects on the aeronaut, similar to “mountain sickness.” The\r\nlevel that a given aeroplane cannot exceed owing to the combined effect\r\nof reduced lift and reduced engine power is known as its “ceiling.”\r\nDifferent types of aeroplane have very different ceilings.\r\n\r\nAt great altitudes the air is always very cold, summer and winter.\r\nThe low temperature may interfere with the efficient working of the\r\nengine, and it is, of course, a source of discomfort to the pilot. The\r\nformation of ice and heavy deposits of snow lead to inconveniences\r\nin both aeroplanes and airships. The pelting of hail is sometimes a\r\npainful experience for aeronauts. Lastly, lightning has hitherto left\r\naviators unscathed, but has caused numerous disasters among balloonists.\r\n\r\nThe recent rapid development of aeronautics has laid a heavy burden of\r\nadditional labor upon the meteorological services of the world, and\r\nis producing something like a revolution in their methods. The history\r\nof these changes is interesting. From the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury until a few years before the World War meteorologists were\r\nengaged in a great campaign of upper-air research, utilizing kites,\r\ncaptive balloons, pilot balloons, and sounding balloons to measure\r\nthe winds, temperature, humidity and pressure at various levels in\r\nthe atmosphere. In other words, aeronautical methods were employed in\r\nthe service of meteorology, but the investigators hardly entertained\r\nthe idea of reversing the relation and making meteorology the\r\nhandmaiden of aeronautics. The point of view prevailing in those days\r\nis well indicated by the fact that the organization that had charge\r\nof the upper-air explorations throughout the world was known as the\r\n“International Commission for Scientific Aeronautics,” a name that it\r\nbore until the year 1919.\r\n\r\nThe plan for providing regular weather reports for the benefit\r\nof aeronauts began with some small-scale enterprises in Germany\r\nabout 1909. In the summer of that year Dr. Franz Linke organized a\r\nstorm-warning service in connection with the International Aeronautical\r\nExposition at Frankfort, and at the beginning of the year 1911 an\r\naeronautical weather bureau for the whole of Germany was established,\r\nwith headquarters at the Observatory of Lindenberg. Shortly before the\r\nwar a similar undertaking was launched in Italy, under Dr. Matteucci,\r\nwhose service was the first one in the world to publish daily charts,\r\nbased on telegraphic reports, of the winds at various levels over an\r\nentire country.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the regular meteorological services of the belligerent\r\ncountries and the meteorological units attached to the armies and\r\nnavies maintained an almost continuous service of weather information\r\nfor the great fleets of fighting aircraft. Bulletins, distributed\r\nchiefly by wireless telegraphy, supplied particulars of the current\r\nand prospective winds at the flying levels, the prevalence of fog,\r\nthe degree of visibility, etc. New telegraphic weather codes, far\r\nmore elaborate than those in use before the war, were devised for\r\ntransmitting such information, and the whole business of observing and\r\nreporting weather became immensely more arduous than it had been in the\r\ndays when the only interests served by practical meteorology were those\r\nof the land and the water.\r\n\r\nSince the close of hostilities great efforts have been made to maintain\r\nthese new operations of the meteorological establishments at something\r\nlike the level attained during the war. The task is, however, beset\r\nwith difficulties, on account of the great expense involved. It is\r\nbeing accomplished with different degrees of success in different\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMILITARY METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing paradoxes connected with the misapplication\r\nof human brains and energy glorified with the name of the “art of war”\r\nis this--that, while weather has always played an important part, and\r\noften a decisive one, in military operations, no attempt was ever made\r\nuntil a few years ago to include meteorology in the purview of military\r\nscience or to utilize the services of meteorologists at the battle\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe most casual survey of the history of warfare reveals the fact that\r\natmospheric conditions rank high among the “controls” of fighting. From\r\na military point of view, weather and climate bear a certain analogy to\r\ntopography. They are a part of the physical environment with which a\r\ncommander has to reckon. Weather, however, differs from topography in\r\nthe fact that it is subject to rapid changes, and is therefore doubly\r\nworthy of attention on the part of an army, which must not only take\r\naccount of the weather as observed and in progress, but must also, as\r\nfar as possible, anticipate that which is to follow.\r\n\r\nEverybody will recall the ruin that overtook the French army in Russia\r\nin 1812 on account of untoward weather conditions, but it is less\r\nwell known that Napoleon, with his usual sagacity, obtained from his\r\nscientific advisers a report on the Russian climate before he planned\r\nhis campaign; that the winter set in much earlier than usual in that\r\nfatal year; and, most interesting of all, that it was actually a brief\r\nperiod of thawing weather, rather than the intense cold that preceded\r\nand followed it, which, by turning the roads into bogs and breaking up\r\nthe ice in the Beresina, brought about the culminating disaster.\r\n\r\nAnother fateful spell of weather ushered in the battle of Waterloo.\r\nIt is described in a well-known passage of “Les Misérables,” which\r\ncontains enough truth mingled with hyperbole to be worth quoting:\r\n\r\n“S’il n’avait pas plu dans la nuit du 17 au 18 janvier, 1815, l’avenir\r\nde l’Europe était changé. Quelques gouttes de plus ou de moins out\r\nfait pencher Napoléon. Pour que Waterloo fût la fin d’Austerlitz, la\r\nProvidence n’a eu besoin que d’un peu de pluie, et un nuage traversant\r\nle ciel à contre-sens de la saison a suffi pour l’écroulement d’un\r\nmonde.”\r\n\r\nThe rains and floods that led to the annihilation of the Roman legions\r\nunder Varus in A. D. 9 and the great tempests that helped English\r\nseamen defeat the Spanish Armada furnish additional well-known examples\r\nof the immense importance of weather as a factor in warfare. We need\r\nnot, however, look farther back than to the recent world conflict\r\nto find similar examples in profusion. Leaving out of consideration\r\nthe indirect effects of the weather upon the progress of the war as\r\nexercised through its control of crops, transportation, and other\r\nfeatures in the economic life of the belligerent and neutral nations,\r\nwe need only examine war-time newspapers to see how the armies\r\nthemselves were helped or harassed by meteorological conditions at\r\nevery turn. The war was a great popular teacher of climatography,\r\njust as it was of geography. The drenching misery of Flemish winters,\r\nas formidable to the soldiers in the trenches as the bullets of the\r\nenemy, became as familiar to the present generation of Americans as did\r\nsomewhat similar conditions in Virginia to Americans of the Civil War\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe British campaigns in Mesopotamia were as much a conflict with\r\nclimate as with human foes. Marches were made when the temperature\r\nstood at 110 degrees Fahrenheit and over. The temperature in the\r\nhospital tents is said to have reached 130 degrees. The disaster\r\nat Kut-el-Amara was due to the rains and floods that prevented\r\nreenforcements from reaching the beleaguered garrison. The failure of\r\nthe Dardanelles expedition was partly due to the fact that the extreme\r\ndryness of the country was not realized--as it would have been if\r\nthe War Office had called climatologists into council--and totally\r\ninadequate provision was made for the water supply.\r\n\r\nThe new engines of war brought forth by the recent struggle were\r\npeculiarly susceptible to the effects of weather. The larger guns\r\nand heavy motor trucks were difficult to move over muddy roads. The\r\naircraft, though they managed to fly in all kinds of weather, suffered\r\ninnumerable disasters for which atmospheric conditions--chiefly storms\r\nand fog--were responsible, and their operations were conspicuously\r\naffected by favorable and unfavorable winds. Shells were fired to\r\nunprecedented heights, and their trajectories were modified by unknown\r\nconditions in the upper air. Last but not least, the use of poisonous\r\ngases, especially in the period before gas clouds were largely replaced\r\nby gas shells, was dependent upon the occurrence of appropriate winds;\r\nand a slight miscalculation in this respect sometimes brought disaster\r\nto the troops using the gas.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that professional meteorologists played a part in\r\nthe World War, but it is difficult to understand why meteorological\r\nunits were not attached to all armies, at least when on active service,\r\nseveral decades before the year 1914. Meteorologists did, indeed, take\r\na hand in one earlier conflict, but not as enrolled soldiers. During\r\nthe Spanish-American War a special service was organized by the United\r\nStates Weather Bureau to protect the American fleet in southern waters\r\nfrom unpleasant surprises in the shape of West India hurricanes. In\r\nthe summer of 1898 a chain of observation stations was established\r\nby the Bureau around the Caribbean Sea. The service then inaugurated\r\nin consequence of the exigencies of war proved so valuable to\r\nshipping in time of peace that it has continued to operate, with some\r\nintermissions, down to the present day.\r\n\r\nWhen the World War broke out, the only country that immediately put\r\nmeteorologists, as such, into the field was Germany. The Germans were\r\nfortunate in having a far greater number of trained meteorologists at\r\ntheir disposal than had their enemies. There were chairs of meteorology\r\nin several German universities and high schools, and the numerous\r\nmeteorological observatories and institutes of the Empire had provided\r\noccupation for a large amount of professional talent in this line. One\r\nof the first acts of the army that invaded Belgium was to establish an\r\naerological service in that country.\r\n\r\nThe Entente countries were slow in adding meteorological units to their\r\narmies, but their civilian meteorological services were utilized to\r\nthe utmost for military purposes from the beginning of the war. They\r\nat first worked under difficulties arising from the cessation of the\r\ncustomary weather reports from central Europe, but, to offset this\r\ndisadvantage, the weather map was expanded in other directions, the\r\nnumber of daily hours of observation was increased, and eventually the\r\nforecasters in London and Paris acquired much better facilities for\r\nmaking their predictions than they had enjoyed in time of peace. The\r\nsupply of weather information to the public was suspended, and great\r\nprecautions were taken to prevent the reports of the Allied services\r\nfrom being utilized by the enemy. The German meteorologists were\r\nseriously hampered by the lack of reports from the westward. It has\r\nbeen asserted that such reports were sometimes obtained by radio from\r\nsubmarines stationed off the coast of Ireland, but such a service, if\r\nit existed, must have been fragmentary and unsatisfactory. That the\r\nGermans made many mistakes in their attempts to infer the atmospheric\r\nconditions over the British Isles from the limited weather map at their\r\ndisposal is proved by the fact that their airships frequently crossed\r\nthe Channel when, with an ampler knowledge of impending weather, they\r\nwould certainly have remained at home. Several Zeppelins came to grief\r\nin the course of these ill-timed raids. One of the interesting routine\r\nduties of the British Meteorological Office during the war was to draw\r\nthe weather map for a given moment as the Germans would probably draw\r\nit, with their curtailed set of telegraphic reports, and then predict\r\nthe German prediction!\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1915 a small meteorological section was organised in\r\nthe British Army, and attached to the Royal Engineers. This force was\r\nafterward enlarged, and provided units for service on several battle\r\nfronts. The British also developed a naval meteorological service,\r\nwhich had existed in embryo before the war, and, eventually, a special\r\nmeteorological service for the Royal Air Force. Analogous services were\r\norganized by the French and the Italians.\r\n\r\nThe United States Army and the United States Navy both established\r\nmeteorological services not long after this country entered the war.\r\nThe former was attached to the Signal Corps, and was partly officered\r\nand recruited from the Weather Bureau. A training school for army\r\nmeteorologists was opened at College Station, Texas. Upward of 300\r\nmen were given instruction in this school, and most of them were sent\r\noverseas. The naval meteorological service was headed by the director\r\nof Blue Hill Observatory, and the junior officers received special\r\ntraining at that institution.\r\n\r\nThe varied activities carried on by these war-time units were so\r\ndifferent from the traditional duties of meteorologists that they may\r\nbe said to mark the advent of a new branch of applied science--Military\r\nMeteorology. They were, moreover, as we shall see, extremely fruitful\r\nof effects upon the science of meteorology in general.\r\n\r\nIn the principal battle zones the military weather men maintained a\r\ndense network of observation stations, the reports from which, combined\r\nwith those received from the regular peace-time weather stations of the\r\nAllied and neutral countries, enabled the forecasters at headquarters\r\nto keep closely in touch with atmospheric changes. Observations of\r\nboth surface and upper-air conditions were made at frequent intervals,\r\nand radiotelegraphy was largely used to insure prompt transmission\r\nof the reports. In general, weather maps were drawn four times a day.\r\nInformation was distributed locally to the fighting units by telephone\r\nand otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe vast fleet of aircraft called into being by the war would, of\r\nitself, have imposed upon the military meteorologists the necessity of\r\npaying a great amount of attention to the upper air. Pilot balloons\r\nwere sent up so frequently and at so many points that the aviators\r\ngenerally knew just what winds they would encounter aloft. Special\r\narrangements were made to follow the progress across the country of the\r\nthundersqualls which constituted a serious danger to the “sausages,” or\r\nobservation balloons, as well as to aeroplanes on the ground, and to\r\nhangars.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another urgent reason for keeping a close watch\r\nof the winds and other atmospheric conditions at various levels above\r\nthe earth’s surface. Experience acquired early in the war proved\r\nthat old-fashioned methods of correcting the aim of artillery for\r\nmeteorological disturbances were extremely inadequate for modern\r\nguns, the projectiles of which rise to altitudes of from 10,000 to\r\n20,000 feet and encounter conditions quite different from those\r\nprevailing at the surface. The flight of a projectile is affected\r\nby the force and direction of the wind, and the density of the air\r\nthrough which it passes. Some modern projectiles remain in the air as\r\nlong as 70 seconds, and a moderate wind blowing across the path of\r\nsuch a projectile may easily cause it to fall half a mile away from\r\nthe point at which it would strike if fired in still air. One of the\r\nroutine duties of the army weather service was to observe the winds\r\nand compute the air-densities at different heights wherever such\r\ninformation was required by the artillery. In order to facilitate\r\nthe application of such data by the gunners ingenious methods were\r\ndeveloped for computing what is known as the “ballistic wind.” This is\r\na fictitious wind which, if affecting the projectile throughout its\r\nflight, would produce the same total deflective effect and effect on\r\nrange as the various winds that the projectile actually encounters.\r\n\r\nMeteorological observations were also of great importance in connection\r\nwith the new process of locating distant guns known as “sound-ranging.”\r\nThis process consists, briefly, in determining the exact instant of\r\narrival at several points of the sound waves propagated through the\r\nair from the gun that is being located. If sound traveled at a uniform\r\nspeed, these observations would show the exact distance of each of the\r\nobserving points from the gun, and a simple geometrical construction\r\nwould indicate the position of the latter. The speed of sound waves\r\nin the air is, however, affected by both wind and temperature.\r\nAccordingly, allowance had to be made for these varying factors, and\r\nthe necessary data were supplied by the meteorological units.\r\n\r\nThe observation and prediction of winds favoring the use of poisonous\r\ngases by friend or foe was one of the most delicate tasks allotted\r\nto the army meteorologists. The flow of such gases is determined by\r\nthe winds close to the surface of the earth, and these are greatly\r\naffected by topography. Local air currents controlled by the slope\r\nof the ground were especially utilized for gas attacks. Strong winds\r\nwere unfavorable, because they quickly dissipated the gas cloud. The\r\nmeteorologists not only advised their own troops when to use gas, but\r\nalso gave warning when the atmospheric conditions were such that gas\r\nwas likely to be used by the enemy. The use of gas shells was less\r\ndependent for its success upon the wind than the liberation of gas\r\nclouds, but even when shells were used the wind and weather at the\r\nobjective point were factors of importance.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of warfare developed several new features of\r\nmeteorological practice, the utility of which did not cease with the\r\nwar. Thus it became customary to measure the degree of “visibility”\r\nof distant objects, for the benefit of aviators and gunners, and\r\nthis element was included in the routine weather reports. Scales of\r\nvisibility, ranging from “very bad” to “excellent,” etc., were adopted,\r\nand eventually certain forms of apparatus (“visibility meters”) were\r\ndevised for getting fairly precise measurements of this weather factor.\r\n\r\nAnother novel practice that deserves to be perpetuated was the plan\r\nadopted by the military forecasters of adding to their predictions\r\na statement as to their probable accuracy; this was expressed on\r\na numerical scale of “odds,” instead of by use of the vague terms\r\n“probably” and “possibly,” which have generally served the purpose of\r\nthe dubious forecaster.\r\n\r\nThe war brought about many improvements in the instruments and\r\nmethods used in sounding the upper air; and the intensive campaign\r\nof pilot-balloon observations carried out at the military stations\r\nprovided a body of data for study quite unparalleled in the history of\r\nmeteorology.\r\n\r\nLastly, the war revolutionized weather telegraphy in Europe. Before\r\nthe war the European forecasters were hampered by exasperating delays\r\nin the collection of reports over the telegraph lines, especially in\r\nthe international exchange of observations. Wireless telegraphy had\r\nbeen extensively used for gathering reports from vessels and supplying\r\nvessels with forecasts, but not for the interchange of meteorological\r\ninformation on land. The war changed all this. Radiotelegraphic weather\r\nmessages became the rule, and the advantages of the new system were\r\nso obvious that the tendency has been to retain it as far as possible\r\nsince the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe starting point in any study of the physiological effects of weather\r\nand climate upon humanity is the remarkable fact that, on the hottest\r\ndays of summer and the coldest of winter, in tropical deserts and amid\r\npolar snows, the temperature within the body of a healthy man remains\r\nconstant to a fraction of a degree. There are slight temperature\r\ndifferences between different parts of the body; there is a periodic\r\ndaily variation of about half a degree; and there are other slight\r\nchanges, due to eating and exercise; but an internal temperature\r\nof about 98.6 degrees F. is maintained with little or no regard to\r\nfluctuations in the temperature of the air.\r\n\r\nThe body has often been compared to a building in which the temperature\r\nis regulated by a thermostat, but the comparison is not exact. The\r\nthermostat controls the temperature merely by regulating the combustion\r\nof fuel; and with the advent of mild weather we let the fires go out\r\naltogether. In the body the fires are always burning, the briskness\r\nwith which they burn--or, to drop the metaphor, the rate at which\r\nbodily heat is generated--depending, above all, upon muscular activity,\r\nbut also upon other causes. It is true that we possess a nervous\r\nmechanism, analogous to the thermostat, which tends to adjust the\r\nproduction of animal heat in such a manner as to offset the cooling\r\neffect of our environment; but this mechanism appears to be less\r\nimportant in maintaining our constant temperature than another, which\r\nregulates the loss of heat from the body. According to M. J. Rosenau:\r\n\r\n“Heat is lost from the body chiefly in two ways; (1) by _heat\r\ntransfer_, or loss by radiation, conduction, and convection; (2) by\r\n_evaporation_, chiefly by the evaporation of the water of perspiration.\r\nPettenkofer and Voit estimated the loss of water by the lungs at\r\n286 grams, and from the skin at from 500 to 1,700 grams daily. This\r\nwill give some idea of the effects here concerned. The loss by heat\r\ntransfer diminishes as the temperature of the surrounding air rises.\r\nThe temperature of the body would rise when the atmospheric temperature\r\ngoes above 70 degrees F. were not perspiration then secreted. So long\r\nas the perspiration can evaporate freely the heat production and heat\r\nloss are balanced. With a high humidity evaporation is lessened and the\r\nbalance is maintained by rushing blood to the skin, which causes an\r\nelevation of the temperature of the surface, and thus the loss of heat\r\nby radiation, conduction, and convection is facilitated.”\r\n\r\nHuman sensations of temperature are paradoxical. We talk of being “hot”\r\nand “cold,” as if we belonged to the class of cold-blooded animals--the\r\nfishes and the reptiles--that actually undergo great variations of\r\ntemperature, with variations in the temperature of their environment.\r\nWe hear people say, for example, that they are most comfortable at a\r\ntemperature of 65; yet we know that their temperature is always 98½,\r\nexcept just at the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nThe human body is, in fact, a poor thermometer. Our sensations do not\r\nregister the temperature of the air, but they do, in a way, register\r\nthe cooling power of the air, which depends upon temperature, humidity,\r\nand air movement, and they register, especially, changes in this\r\ncooling power, for within certain limits the body soon adapts itself\r\nto a constant rate of cooling, so as to lose any impression of heat or\r\ncold. When a steady outflow of heat from the body has been set up and\r\nthe external cooling power is suddenly increased, we become conscious\r\nof a difference between the temperature at the surface of the body\r\nand the “blood temperature” beneath. The action of the nerves at the\r\nsurface and the nerves underneath, under these circumstances, has been\r\ncompared to that of a thermo-junction, in which an electric current is\r\nproduced by differences of temperature. The rate of evaporation from\r\nthe skin, also, has a marked effect upon our sensations of comfort and\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nThe common thermometer was long ago discredited as a means of measuring\r\natmospheric comfort. Then, for a time, the wet-bulb thermometer had its\r\nday, and its indications were once published on a large scale in this\r\ncountry as representing the “sensible temperature,” or temperature that\r\nwe actually feel. The wet-bulb thermometer is cooled by evaporation\r\nbelow the air temperature, except when the air is saturated with\r\nmoisture, and may therefore give a rough indication of the temperature\r\nacquired by the skin when moistened with perspiration. The temperature\r\nof the skin is not, however, an accurate indication of our feelings\r\nof heat or cold, nor is it a satisfactory guide to the physiological\r\neffects of atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral instruments have been devised for the purpose of measuring the\r\ncooling power of the air, to which the bodily mechanism must respond\r\nin order to maintain a uniform temperature within. One of these was\r\ninvented nearly half a century ago by J. W. Osborne. A porous cylinder\r\nwas filled with warm water, and an agitator, driven by clockwork, kept\r\nthe water in the cylinder at uniform temperature at any given moment.\r\nThe rate at which heat was lost from the wet surface of the cylinder\r\nwas determined by a thermometer, having its bulb immersed in the water,\r\nand a stop watch. A different plan was adopted by A. Piche, in an\r\ninstrument which he called the _deperditometer_, and which was supposed\r\nto imitate more closely the behavior of the body. A porous vessel is\r\nfilled with water, the temperature of which is kept constantly at\r\n“blood heat” (98.6 degrees F.) by a gas jet provided with an automatic\r\nregulator. The amount of gas burned in a given time is then supposed to\r\nmeasure the cooling power of the atmosphere as it affects humanity. J.\r\nR. Milne’s _psuchrainometer_ is constructed on the same principle, but\r\nheat is supplied and measured electrically.\r\n\r\nAmong many other instruments of this class, one that now enjoys special\r\nfavor is the _katathermometer_, devised by Prof. Leonard Hill, in\r\nEngland. This consists of a pair of large-bulbed spirit thermometers,\r\none of which has its bulb covered with fine cotton mesh. To use the\r\ninstrument, the bulbs are immersed in water at about 150 degrees\r\nF. until the spirit rises to the top of the thermometer tubes. The\r\nexcess of water is then jerked off the wet bulb, and the other bulb\r\nis dried. The instruments are finally suspended in the air, and the\r\nrate of cooling from 110 to 100 degrees, or from 100 to 90 degrees,\r\nis taken with a stop watch. The dry-bulb measurements are supposed to\r\nshow how fast the human body loses heat at its surface by radiation\r\nand convection, while the wet-bulb measurements also take account of\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nIn order to connect the readings of this device with human sensations,\r\nHill and his collaborators have used the instrument under a great\r\nvariety of atmospheric conditions, both indoors and out, and compared\r\nthe readings with independent estimates of comfort and discomfort. On\r\nan ideal summer day the “wet kata” fell from 110 to 100 in 25 seconds,\r\nand the “dry kata” in 85 seconds. Indoors at the seaside in summer,\r\nunder comfortable conditions, the readings were 50 seconds and 140\r\nseconds, respectively. A large number of other readings, taken under\r\ndifferent conditions in various parts of the word, have been published.\r\nThe katathermometer is now used in both Great Britain and the United\r\nStates in the study of ventilation problems, and has acquired a rather\r\nextensive literature. According to its inventor, “the heating and\r\nventilation of rooms should be arranged so that the wet-bulb falls from\r\n100 to 90 degrees in about one minute, and the dry-bulb in about three\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WEATHER BUREAU KIOSK, IN UNION SQUARE, SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n(_Photograph, U. S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU STATION, OBSERVATORY\r\nTYPE, AT PEORIA, ILLINOIS. (_Photograph, U. S. Weather Bureau._)]\r\n\r\nRegardless of the merits of these particular instruments, it is\r\ncertain that the cooling power of the air--which is quite a different\r\nthing from the temperature of the air--is a very important factor in\r\ndetermining our comfort and our health. Within certain limits the body\r\ncan easily adjust itself to changes in the cooling power of the air;\r\nwithin wider limits the adjustment is effected with difficulty, and we\r\nexperience discomfort and possibly suffer in health; and finally\r\nthere are extreme conditions, in either direction, to which adjustment\r\nis not possible; the internal temperature is then either lowered or\r\nraised, as the case may be, and a comparatively small change of this\r\nsort is fatal; i. e., death results by chilling or by heat stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo U. S. Weather Bureau\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU IN WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nOne interesting result of recent inquiries on this subject is the\r\ndiscovery that the bad effects of crowded, “stuffy” rooms are not\r\ngenerally due to impurities in the air, but to heat, humidity, and\r\nespecially lack of air movement. It seems to be now demonstrated\r\nthat there is no such thing as “crowd-poisoning,” and that the\r\nbad smells of confined places are no indication that the air is\r\ndeleterious. Professor Hill, who has done more than anybody else to\r\nupset traditional ideas with regard to ventilation, tells us that\r\n“the deaths in the Black Hole of Calcutta, the depression, headache,\r\netc., experienced in close rooms are alike due to heat stagnation; the\r\nvictims of the Black Hole died of heat stroke.” Most recent writers\r\non physiology also discredit the time-honored methods of testing the\r\npurity of the air by measuring the percentage of carbon dioxide it\r\ncontains. The amount of this gas normally present in the free air is\r\nabout three-hundredths of one per cent, but experiments have shown\r\nthat thirty times this amount--a percentage higher than is found in\r\nthe worst ventilated rooms--may be breathed for hours together without\r\ndetrimental effects. A further departure from old-fashioned views\r\nis seen in the assertion of recent authorities that a deficiency\r\nof oxygen, unless far more pronounced than ever actually occurs in\r\nbuildings, mines, etc., where the supply of this gas has been the\r\nsubject of so much solicitude, has no physiological significance\r\nwhatever. In support of this assertion it is pointed out that at\r\nmountain health resorts the concentration of oxygen out-of-doors is\r\nmuch less than that found in the worst ventilated rooms at sea-level.\r\nIn mines an ample supply of oxygen may be positively dangerous, as\r\nfavoring the occurrence of explosions. These were rare before the\r\nenactment of laws requiring a high percentage of oxygen in mine air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILL’S KATATHERMOMETER]\r\n\r\nExcessive dryness of the skin, which is a common cause of discomfort,\r\nis not very closely related to the humidity of the air. “In winter,”\r\nsays Hill, “if there be a wind the rate of evaporation is so\r\naccelerated that the skin feels dry, because in order to check the\r\nloss of body heat the sweat glands are inactive and the blood vessels\r\nof the chilled skin are constricted.” There has been a great deal of\r\ndiscussion about the dry air of American buildings in winter, and\r\nstartling figures have been adduced to show that the air of such\r\nbuildings is dryer than that of deserts. So far as measurements of\r\nrelative humidity go, this is perfectly true; but, as Dr. G. T.\r\nPalmer, of the New York State Commission on Ventilation, has pointed\r\nout, there is an important difference between dryness and “dryingness.”\r\nThe latter depends upon the movement of the air, as well as the\r\nrelative humidity. The circulation of the air in a desert is generally\r\nmuch more active than that of the air in a building with the windows\r\nshut, and therefore much more conducive to rapid evaporation. There are\r\nsystems of ventilation in which the air is kept in steady and rapid\r\nmotion, and it is probably only in such cases that the air of our\r\nheated houses can be compared to that of a desert. From the European\r\npoint of view American buildings are notoriously overheated, but this\r\nis probably due to the fact that our hot summers--much hotter than\r\nthose of Europe--have adapted us to a tropical climate.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to inquire whether the atmospheric conditions that\r\naffect the comfort of man do not also exercise a marked influence\r\nupon his muscular efficiency and his mental powers. This question has\r\nbeen answered in the affirmative by a number of ingenious writers,\r\nwho have sought to establish definite quantitative relations between\r\ncertain states of the atmosphere and the output of work in factories,\r\nthe grades attained by school children, etc. Thus, Dr. Ellsworth\r\nHuntington, a well-known worker in this field, declares that the most\r\nfavorable daily mean temperature for mental activity (the temperature\r\nbeing measured out-of-doors) is about 40 degrees F., and for physical\r\nactivity about 60 degrees F. Contrary to the common opinion, he holds\r\nthat our general efficiency is at low ebb in midwinter and fairly high\r\nin summer. Variability in temperature, within certain limits, he finds\r\nto be stimulating; equable temperature the reverse. He has drawn\r\ncharts showing the distribution of what he calls “climatic energy”--i.\r\ne., the combination of certain weather factors supposed to control\r\nhuman efficiency--throughout the world, and other charts showing a\r\nmore or less similar distribution of “civilization.” He has also made\r\nan ambitious attempt to interpret the history of mankind in terms of\r\nweather and climate.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful worker along similar lines is Dr. Griffith Taylor,\r\nof Australia, who has made interesting studies of the control of\r\nsettlement in his own country and elsewhere by temperature and\r\nhumidity, and has introduced some novel graphic methods (“climographs”)\r\nfor comparing climates with respect to their effects on humanity.\r\n\r\nThere has, in short, arisen a new school of climatologists whose aim\r\nis to develop exact mathematical formulæ whereby we shall be able\r\nto adjust the economic arrangements of mankind on an intelligent\r\nbasis as regards climate. The success of their efforts is a question\r\nfor the future to decide, but there is no doubt that their work is\r\nprofoundly suggestive. These undertakings, it may be noted, bear a\r\nstriking analogy to those of the present generation of agricultural\r\nmeteorologists, who are applying climatic statistics to the problem of\r\nselecting crops and to the improvement of agricultural methods.\r\n\r\nA certain number of specialists are engaged in studying the\r\nphysiological effects of sunlight and other special kinds of solar\r\nradiation, the distribution of which varies greatly from place to\r\nplace and from time to time, especially on account of differences in\r\nthe selective absorption of such rays by the atmosphere. The chemical\r\naction of sunshine that causes sunburn--even at very low temperatures,\r\nas, for example, on high mountains--may have far-reaching effects on\r\nthe human organism (as it certainly has on plants), and there is great\r\nneed of collecting more data of “photochemical climate” than we now\r\npossess, in order that this subject may be thoroughly investigated. One\r\nof the few institutions in the world at which a large amount of work\r\nhas been done in this line is the private observatory of Dr. C. Dorno,\r\nat Davos, the well-known health resort in the Alps. Dorno’s studies\r\nthrow a good deal of light upon the therapeutic effects of sunshine in\r\na mountain climate.\r\n\r\nMany forms of dust in the atmosphere are capable of producing\r\npronounced physiological and pathological effects. There is a long\r\nlist of “dusty trades” in which the production of excessive dust has\r\nnotoriously evil effects upon the health of workmen, leading especially\r\nto pulmonary diseases; sometimes to various kinds of poisoning. These\r\nharmful dusts are by no means confined to factories, mines, quarries,\r\nand the like. The air of the average city street abounds in them. Dr.\r\nJ. G. Ogden states that 61 per cent of the dust found in the air of the\r\nNew York subways consists of jagged splinters of steel, resulting from\r\nthe wearing away of brake shoes, wheels, and rails.\r\n\r\nThe amount of danger to human health incurred through the presence\r\nof disease germs in the atmosphere has been the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. The present tendency is to regard this danger as very\r\nslight, under ordinary conditions. Thus, Dr. F. S. Lee writes:\r\n\r\n“Evidence that disease germs pass through the air from room to room\r\nof a house or from a hospital to its immediate surroundings always\r\nbreaks down when examined critically. It is indeed not rare now to\r\ntreat cases of different infectious diseases in the same hospital\r\nward. The one place of possible danger is in the immediate vicinity\r\nof a person suffering from a disease affecting the air passages, the\r\nmouth, throat, or lungs, such as a ‘cold’ or tuberculosis. Such a\r\nperson may give out the characteristic microbe for a distance of a few\r\nfeet from his body, not in quiet expiration, for simple expired air is\r\nsterile, but attached to droplets that may be expelled in coughing,\r\nsneezing, or forcible speaking. In this manner infection may, and\r\nprobably does, occur, the evidence being perhaps strongest in the case\r\nof tuberculosis. But apart from this source there appears to be little\r\ndanger of contracting an infectious disease from germs that float in\r\nthe air.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to sewer gas, which still inspires so much dread in the\r\npopular mind, Dr. Lee says:\r\n\r\n“Workmen in sewers are notoriously strong, vigorous, healthy men,\r\nwith a low death rate among them. The specter of an invisible monster\r\nentering our homes surreptitiously from our plumbing pipes and sapping\r\nour lives and the lives of our children must be laid aside; we need no\r\nlonger leave saucers of so-called ‘chlorides’ standing about our floors\r\nto neutralize in an impossible manner mysterious effluvia that do not\r\nexist; and when we return to our town houses in the autumn we may enter\r\nthem with no fears that we are risking our lives by coming into a\r\ntoxic, germ-infected, sewer gas-laden, deadly atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nPresent-day knowledge on the subject of infectious diseases discredits\r\nmany ideas that once prevailed with regard to the effects of tropical\r\nclimates on health. The remarkable results accomplished by vigorous\r\nsanitary measures in such places as Havana, the Isthmus of Panama and\r\nGuayaquil have aroused hopes--perhaps too sanguine--that eventually\r\nall parts of the tropics will be made healthful for the white race. In\r\nthe Canal Zone the death rate of the large population of American men,\r\nwomen, and children is not higher than prevails in many cities of the\r\nUnited States; whereas, a generation ago, when the French were at work\r\non the canal, the “climate” of this region was regarded as one of the\r\nmost unhealthful in the world. Some authorities go so far as to assert\r\nthat the deterioration in the general health and efficiency of white\r\npeople in the tropics, so far as it actually occurs, is due entirely\r\nto preventable diseases. It would seem more rational, however, to\r\nassume that there are climates both in and out of the tropics which,\r\non account of their heat, humidity, and other purely physical factors,\r\nare not so suitable for habitation for any race of humanity as others.\r\nHow far acclimatization can go toward offsetting the effects of these\r\natmospheric conditions is problematical.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the barometer that occur from day to day in regions\r\nwhere these changes are most pronounced are, on an average,\r\nnot greater than those encountered in going from the bottom to\r\nthe top of a good-sized hill, and are probably not directly of\r\nphysiological importance. Certain European investigators, however,\r\nascribe pathological effects to the minute and rapid barometric\r\nfluctuations--too small to be detected with an ordinary barometer--that\r\noccur, for example, when the foehn wind is blowing. Whether this is\r\nthe cause, or a contributory cause, of “foehn-sickness,” of which one\r\nhears in Switzerland, is still uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects of a rarefied atmosphere, as experienced\r\nin mountain climbing, ballooning, and aviation, are not yet well\r\nunderstood, despite the large amount of study that has been devoted to\r\nthis subject. Recent views are thus summarized by Rosenau:\r\n\r\n“The symptoms produced by a marked diminution in atmospheric pressure\r\nvary with circumstances. The effects are increased by cold, active\r\nmuscular exertion, or improper clothing. The noticeable symptoms are\r\nincreased rapidity of respiration and acceleration of the circulation,\r\nnoises in the head and dizziness, impairment of the senses of sight,\r\nhearing, and touch, dullness of the intellectual faculties, and a\r\nstrong desire to sleep. Sudden changes to a rarefied atmosphere cause\r\nsyncope, weakness, dyspnœa, dizziness, and nausea. These threatening\r\nsymptoms go by the name of ‘mountain sickness,’ Bert and Journet\r\nbelieve this condition is due to lack of oxygen, and the symptoms may,\r\nin fact, be relieved by adding oxygen to the air inspired. Kronecker\r\nconcludes that mountain sickness is caused by a congestion of the\r\nlungs, impeding the flow of blood through them. Mosso and his followers\r\nattribute the physical disturbances of a reduced atmospheric pressure\r\nto the fact that the blood loses carbon dioxide more quickly than it\r\nloses oxygen, and they ascribe mountain sickness to this decrease of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the blood. Cohnheim believes there is a concentration\r\nof the blood at high altitudes; in fact, insignificant increases have\r\nbeen found by competent observers.”\r\n\r\nDivers and workers in caissons are subjected to high barometric\r\npressure, amounting, at the maximum, to about 4½ atmospheres.\r\nAccording to Rosenau:\r\n\r\n“The physiological effects of an increased atmospheric pressure\r\nare mainly due to an increase in the amount of atmospheric gases\r\n(especially nitrogen) which are taken up by the blood, and also to an\r\nincrease in the chemical absorption of oxygen by the blood. The serious\r\nconsequences usually result from too rapid decompression. As the\r\npressure is released gas bubbles form. Gradual decompression gives a\r\nchance for the gas to escape from the lungs and be expelled without the\r\nproduction of bubbles.”\r\n\r\nThe health and comfort of many people seem to be affected, in a\r\nrather striking way, by the passage of the barometric depressions and\r\nareas of high pressure that alternate at intervals of a few days in\r\nthe temperate zones. These effects should not be ascribed to changes\r\nof pressure, but rather to the accompanying changes in the other\r\nmeteorological conditions. The late Dr. Weir Mitchell, who was a\r\npioneer student of such phenomena, wrote of “a neuralgic belt, within\r\nwhich, as it sweeps along in advance of the storm, prevail in the hurt\r\nand maimed limbs of men, in the tender nerves and rheumatic joints,\r\nrenewed torments called into existence by the stir and perturbation of\r\nthe elements.” Victims of neuralgia and rheumatism are probably quite\r\njustified in regarding themselves as human barometers, capable of\r\npredicting with considerable accuracy the advent of stormy and rainy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations of temperature, humidity, and wind that attend\r\nthe passage of barometric highs and lows would seem, in virtue\r\nof their effects on the heat-regulating mechanism of the body and\r\nconsequent reactions upon the nervous system in general, to supply\r\nan ample explanation of the unpleasant symptoms above noted in the\r\ncase of sensitive people; conditions to which the collective name of\r\n“cyclonopathy” has been given by European investigators, and which are\r\nextensively discussed in the works of Hellpach, Frankenhäuser, and\r\nBerliner. Some authorities have, however, invoked in this connection\r\nthe possible effects of atmospheric electricity, and pointed to the\r\nextreme sensitiveness of many persons to the approach of thunderstorms;\r\na condition which Dr. G. M. Beard named “astraphobia.” It is stated\r\nthat the passage of a low-pressure area favors the emission of\r\nradioactive emanations from the ground, that the ionization of the\r\natmosphere, and hence its electrical conductivity, is thus increased,\r\nand that the electric charge of the body is carried away more rapidly\r\nthan usual. Here we enter upon a debatable subject, but one that\r\nthoroughly merits investigation. The human organism is the seat of\r\nvarious electrical phenomena, and these certainly cannot be independent\r\nof changes in the electrical state of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nApart from possible direct effects of atmospheric electricity upon\r\nthe human system, it has been suggested that electrical changes in\r\nthe atmosphere affect the rate of reproduction of bacteria, and may\r\ntherefore have some influence on the spread of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nThe weather has many subtle influences upon the human mind, producing\r\nmoods of cheerfulness and depression, and manifesting themselves in\r\nthe records of the behavior of school children, in statistics of\r\ncrime, insanity, suicide, drunkenness, etc. An interesting account of\r\nthese manifestations is given by Dr. E. G. Dexter in his book “Weather\r\nInfluences” (New York, 1904).\r\n\r\nFinally, the aspect of meteorology that has thus far acquired the most\r\ndefinite shape in medical circles and given rise to the most coherent\r\nbody of literature is Medical Climatology, which is designed to be\r\napplied in the climatic treatment of disease (climatotherapy). Thus\r\nmany compilations have been made of the climatic statistics of health\r\nresorts, and these resorts have been classified with respect to their\r\nsupposed climatic effects upon various diseases. From the point of view\r\nof the physical climatologist, the statistics found in such books seem,\r\nin general, both meager and ill adapted to bring out important features\r\nof the climates discussed; to say nothing of the fact that the whole\r\nsubject of climatotherapy is fraught with controversy--whereof the\r\nhistory of the treatment of tuberculosis furnishes a shining example!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nWEATHER-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorologists, in their candid moments, have been heard to express\r\ndisappointment over the amount of progress made in the art of weather\r\nforecasting during the past half-century. “Shall we ever,” they ask,\r\n“be able to predict the weather with mathematical certainty, as the\r\nastronomer predicts an eclipse of the sun or moon?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps even within the meteorological fold there are unorthodox\r\noptimists who would answer such a question thus: “Yes, because some day\r\nwe shall _control_ the weather. It is inconceivable that man, who is\r\nevery day achieving new miracles in the conquest of nature, should not\r\neventually find a way of regulating the rainfall and sunshine that are\r\nof such vital importance to his crops, the winds that must be reckoned\r\nwith in his voyages by sea and air, and the various other elements of\r\nweather that have so much to do with his happiness and welfare. The\r\nattainment of this object is so tremendously desirable that it cannot\r\nforever baffle human ingenuity.”\r\n\r\nIn support of such a bold assertion it might be pointed out that we\r\nalready control the weather to a certain limited extent. When the\r\nhorticulturist burns orchard heaters to protect his fruit from frost\r\nhe certainly alters the weather for a few hours over a small area of\r\nthe earth. If there were any practical justification of the process,\r\nthe temperature of the air over an entire State, for example, could be\r\nraised throughout the winter, with appreciable effects on agriculture.\r\nThe difference between heating a single orchard for a night and heating\r\na State for a season is one of degree, and not of principle.\r\n\r\nThe climate of a city is, through causes dependent upon man, materially\r\ndifferent from the natural climate of the surrounding country. Every\r\ndwelling provided with heating arrangements enjoys an artificial summer\r\namid the blasts of winter. Local control of the winds is exemplified\r\nin the planting of thousands of miles of trees as windbreaks in the\r\nprairie regions of our Middle West. By moderating the winds this\r\nprocess has a marked effect on temperature and evaporation and is so\r\nbeneficial to crops that in the aggregate it furnishes a striking\r\nexample of successful “weather-making” by mankind. Analogous methods,\r\nperfectly feasible with means already at our disposal, would change the\r\nwhole climatic aspect of large areas of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe question “Can we make it rain?” may be answered in the affirmative\r\nby those who are neither impostors nor victims of self-delusion. The\r\ndeposit of spray from the spout of a teakettle might, without much\r\nstretching of terms, be described as a miniature artificial rainstorm;\r\nbut much bigger showers, in nowise different from those occurring in\r\nnature, can also be produced artificially. Huge clouds have often been\r\nobserved to form over forest fires and other great conflagrations.\r\nThese clouds, composed of water drops, tower far above the smoke cloud,\r\nand are identical in character and mode of origin with the cumulus and\r\ncumulo-nimbus clouds formed by currents of moist air rising from the\r\nheated ground on a summer day. There are several well-authenticated\r\ncases in which rain has been seen to fall from such clouds, and these\r\nshowers have sometimes been so heavy as to extinguish the fires\r\nthat generated them. Hence, given favorable conditions of humidity,\r\ntemperature and wind, mankind can certainly produce a rainstorm (and\r\nperhaps a thunderstorm into the bargain) by the relatively simple\r\nprocess of building a big fire.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the vast majority of methods whereby man has attempted\r\nto regulate the weather have no such rational foundation as those we\r\nhave just mentioned. Some are wholly superstitious, others are purely\r\nempirical, and yet others are based upon ideas that their promoters\r\nsuppose or pretend to be scientific, but that are actually fallacious.\r\n\r\nIn the history of superstitious practices weather-making plays a\r\nprominent part. Sir J. G. Frazer, in that great storehouse of myth and\r\nfolklore, “The Golden Bough,” says: “Of the things which the public\r\nmagician sets himself to do for the good of the tribe, one of the\r\nchief is to control the weather and especially to insure an adequate\r\nfall of rain. In savage communities the rain-maker is a very important\r\npersonage; and often a special class of magicians exists for the\r\npurpose of regulating the heavenly water supply.” Frazer devotes ninety\r\npages of his work to a rapid survey of the superstitious methods of\r\ncontrolling the weather that have found credence among the various\r\nraces of mankind. These range all the way from the most complicated\r\nceremonies to the summary expedient of throwing a passing stranger into\r\na river to bring rain.\r\n\r\nThe sailor who whistles or scratches the mast to raise a wind is merely\r\nkeeping up a quaint custom, in the efficacy of which he may or may\r\nnot put some lingering faith, but which the world at large long since\r\nceased to take seriously. When, however, a vessel master attempts to\r\ndisperse a waterspout by firing a cannon at it, he is doing what nine\r\neducated persons out of ten would probably do under the circumstances.\r\nYet one process is no more futile than the other, and both are based\r\non superstition. Ages ago sailors sought to frighten waterspouts away\r\nby pointing knives at them, or by shouts and the clashing of swords,\r\nand the use of cannon originally embodied the same idea of terrifying\r\nthe watery monster. It is our purpose in the present chapter to\r\ndescribe especially several processes of weather-making which, while\r\nnot obviously chimerical from the point of view of the layman, have\r\nbeen more or less positively discredited through the scrutiny of men of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of modern weather-makers have been directed especially\r\nto two objects; viz., the production of rain and the prevention of\r\nhailstorms. In the United States a certain amount of ingenuity has\r\nalso been devoted to the task of dispelling tornadoes. Some years\r\nago a device for the latter purpose was patented, consisting of a\r\nbox, containing explosives, mounted on a pole and erected a mile or\r\nso to the southwestward of the village to be protected from these\r\nunwelcome visitors. The force of the wind was expected to detonate the\r\nexplosives by driving a movable board against percussion caps. The\r\ninventor believed that a violent explosion would disperse the passing\r\ntornado funnel. Apart from the fact that a single installation of\r\nthis character, or even several of them, would seldom happen to be\r\nat exactly the right spot to explode close to the relatively small\r\nvortex of a tornado, the effect of the explosion, even in the very\r\nheart of the storm, would certainly be negligible. The energy that\r\nkeeps the tornado in action is supplied continuously from a level far\r\nabove the earth, while the disturbance due to the explosion would be\r\nonly momentary. Above all, the energy developed in any discharge of\r\nexplosives that the community could afford to pay for would be quite\r\ninsignificant compared with that which prodigal nature supplies to the\r\ntornado.\r\n\r\nThe same disproportion between the giant forces at work in the\r\natmosphere and the pygmy forces at the disposal of mankind is a point\r\nthat is overlooked in most attempts at weather-making.\r\n\r\nThe widespread belief that rain can be produced by explosions\r\nrises so far above the level of ordinary popular delusions that it\r\nhas sometimes led to large expenditures of money on the part of\r\ndrought-ridden communities and even of national governments. Perhaps\r\nthe most remarkable example of official confidence in the efficacy of\r\nthis process was that furnished some years ago by the Volksraad, or\r\nlegislative assembly, of the Transvaal, which passed a law forbidding\r\nthe bombardment of the clouds to produce rain, on the ground that the\r\nrain-makers were thwarting the will of the Almighty!\r\n\r\nOne manifestation of the belief in question is found in the common\r\nassertion that rain is the usual sequel of battles. This idea\r\noriginated, however, long before the invention of gunpowder. It\r\nis mentioned by Plutarch and other writers of antiquity. Whatever\r\nsuperstition or crude process of reasoning may have first given support\r\nto this notion in the popular mind, the explanation now commonly\r\nadvanced is that the condensation of moisture is promoted by the\r\nconcussion due to cannonading, or that the drops already condensed and\r\nconstituting the clouds are jostled together by the same disturbance,\r\nwith the result that they coalesce and fall as rain. There is no ground\r\nfor such assumptions. As was once pointed out by the late Professor\r\nSimon Newcomb, the effect of a violent explosion upon a body of moist\r\nair a quarter of a mile distant is about the same as that which the\r\nclapping of one’s hands would produce upon the moist air of the room\r\nin which the experiment is performed. Again, if we stand in the steam\r\nescaping from a teakettle and clap our hands we shall not produce a\r\nshower, though we jostle the water drops much more than the explosion\r\ndoes at a distance of a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nIn recent years another explanation has been offered for the alleged\r\nproduction of rain by explosions; viz., that the smoke and gases\r\narising from an explosion increase condensation by increasing the\r\nnumber of “nuclei” in the atmosphere. As we have seen, however, in\r\nconsidering the natural formation of rain, the number of condensation\r\nnuclei normally present in the atmosphere is so great that it must be\r\ndiminished, rather than increased, before drops as large as raindrops\r\ncan be formed. Moreover, the nuclei required for the condensation of\r\nwater vapor, including molecules of highly hygroscopic gases, are given\r\nforth in abundance by great manufacturing centers, yet these places do\r\nnot have a heavier rainfall than the surrounding country. Pittsburgh,\r\nfor example, is actually one of the driest places in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOne obvious reason why rain often follows a battle is that battles are\r\nfrequently fought in regions where rain normally occurs every two or\r\nthree days, on an average, whether in peace or war. In northern France,\r\nfor example, where the battles of the World War were plenteously\r\ninterspersed with showers, meteorological records show that the average\r\nnumber of rainy days per annum is upward of 150. The drenching rains\r\nthat made “Virginia mud” a byword during the American Civil War gave\r\ngreat currency to the belief in “rain after battles,” Here, again, we\r\nhave accurate weather records to help us dispel a fallacy. Thus at\r\nRichmond rain falls on 122 days in an average year, at Lynchburg on 124\r\ndays, and at Petersburg on 105 days.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a particular reason why rain is rather more likely\r\nto occur soon after a battle than shortly before one; viz., the fact\r\nthat intervals of fair weather, with consequent dry roads, are used\r\nby commanders in carrying out the movement of troops that precede an\r\nengagement. By the time such arrangements, often occupying several\r\ndays, are completed, the “spell” of fine weather is likely to be over,\r\nand a rainstorm is due in accordance with the normal program of nature.\r\n\r\nThe most famous undertaking in the history of rain-making--and one\r\nwhich has had an incalculable effect in fostering the credulity of the\r\npublic with respect to similar enterprises--was that carried out by\r\nGeneral Robert Dyrenforth on behalf of the United States Government\r\nin 1891. Congress voted appropriations amounting to $9,000 for these\r\nexperiments, and Dyrenforth was appointed a “special agent” of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture to direct them. After some preliminary trials\r\nin the suburbs of Washington, the experimenters proceeded to a ranch\r\nnear Midland, Texas. Here a few balloons filled with a mixture of\r\noxygen and hydrogen, as well as several sticks of dynamite carried\r\nup by kites, were exploded in the air, but the only explosions of\r\nconsiderable magnitude were set off on the ground. The experiments\r\ncontinued over a period of three weeks and in some cases showers fell\r\nwithin a few hours after an explosion, but, in spite of the somewhat\r\nfavorable tone of the official report, the consensus of scientific\r\nopinion was that the undertaking was a failure, while the views of\r\nthe public at large were divided. The attitude of the Government is\r\nsufficiently indicated by the fact that it has never since undertaken\r\nexperiments in this line. The one tangible outcome of this affair was\r\nthat a crop of private rain-makers sprang up all over the country, and\r\nto this day the example set by the official experimenters is cited\r\nin support of every sort of harebrained scheme for juggling with the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 and 1912 the late C. W. Post, of breakfast-food fame, expended\r\nmany thousand pounds of dynamite in efforts to produce rain in Texas\r\nand Michigan. Showers undoubtedly occurred in conjunction with Post’s\r\nexperiments, but conditions favoring their occurrence were plainly\r\nindicated on the current daily weather maps, and they had been duly\r\nforecast by the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe professional rain-maker does not generally resort to the expensive\r\nprocess of bombarding the clouds. His methods most frequently involve\r\nthe use of chemicals, and the details are shrouded in mystery. For\r\nexample, about a quarter of a century ago one Frank Melbourne, known as\r\n“the Australian rain-maker,” enjoyed great celebrity and coined money\r\nby his exploits in this field. His plan was to shut himself up in a\r\nbarn, freight car, or other structure, and manipulate his chemicals\r\nand electric batteries for hours or days. Naturally rain sometimes came\r\nafter these operations, but as often it did not.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the methods that have been suggested from time to time\r\nfor producing rain are sufficiently discredited by the fact that the\r\nexpense of putting them into execution would more than offset any\r\nbenefits derived from the rain, if the experiments proved successful.\r\nThus one genius, observing the deposit of water on the outside of an\r\nice pitcher in a warm room, proposed to set up a barrier packed with\r\nice in the path of moisture-bearing winds. Another plan occasionally\r\nsuggested is to sprinkle the atmosphere aloft with liquid air or\r\nliquid carbon dioxide, in order to lower the temperature, by the rapid\r\nevaporation of these substances, below the point of condensation. A\r\nthird proposal is to create a local updraft of air by means of powerful\r\nfans or blowers, thus imitating the convectional process by which\r\nclouds and rain are formed in nature.\r\n\r\nLastly, various plans have been suggested for altering the electrical\r\ncondition of the upper atmosphere--for example, by electrical\r\ndischarges from balloons--on the assumption that rainfall might thus be\r\npromoted. This assumption, however, is not consistent with known facts\r\nas to the relation between atmospheric electricity and the condensation\r\nof atmospheric water vapor.\r\n\r\nWhile in America a vast amount of money has been wasted on futile\r\nexperiments in rain-making, far more has been spent in Europe on\r\nschemes for averting hailstorms. Methods of accomplishing this purpose\r\nhave varied from age to age. In antiquity it was the custom to shoot\r\narrows or hurl javelins toward the gathering clouds in the hope of\r\nfrightening them away. In the Middle Ages ecclesiastical or occult\r\nagencies were invoked; “hail crosses” (such as are still seen in the\r\nTyrol) were erected; and the ringing of church bells was considered\r\nefficacious against both hail and lightning, as is shown by the\r\ninscriptions found on many old bells.\r\n\r\nThe custom of firing cannon at the clouds to avert hail began centuries\r\nago in Styria and northern Italy, and it was well established in France\r\nbefore the Revolution. Toward the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nhowever, another method of hail protection was introduced in France,\r\nwhence it spread over the rest of Europe. This consisted in setting up\r\ntall, metal-tipped poles, imitated from lightning rods. It was supposed\r\nthat these poles, which were known as _paragrêles_, would draw the\r\nelectric charge from the clouds and thereby (though nobody could say\r\nwhy) would prevent the formation of hailstones. This device, though\r\nreported on unfavorably by the French Academy of Sciences, gained\r\ngreat popularity. One of its advocates, writing in 1827, states that\r\nmore than a million _paragrêles_ were at that time in use in France,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy, Austria, Bavaria, and the Rhine country. The vogue\r\nenjoyed by these contrivances is said to have come to a sudden end when\r\na tremendous hailstorm not only devastated the fields and vineyards\r\nthey were supposed to protect, but also knocked down a great number of\r\nthe rods themselves.\r\n\r\nIn recent times both the hail cannon and the _paragrêle_ have been\r\nrevived. The new era of “hail-shooting,” as the process of cannonading\r\nthe hail clouds is called, dates from the year 1896, when a number of\r\ncannon of a new type were installed in the vine-growing district of\r\nWindisch-Feistritz, in Styria. The success claimed for them in this\r\nregion led to their introduction on a vast scale over the greater\r\npart of southern and central Europe. The cannon employed were small\r\nmortars, to the muzzles of which were attached sheet-iron funnels.\r\nNo projectile was used, but the explosion of the charge sent aloft a\r\ncurious whirling ring of smoke and gas, powerful enough to splinter\r\nsticks and kill small birds several hundred feet from the cannon. By\r\nthe year 1900 at least 10,000 hail cannon were in use in Italy alone.\r\nSeveral modifications of the device were introduced, such as the use of\r\nacetylene in place of gunpowder; and eventually certain forms of rocket\r\nand bomb were adopted, for concentrating the effects of the explosion\r\nat as high a level as possible.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1899 a new form of hail rod was introduced in France,\r\nand this has become the favorite means of protection against hail in\r\nthat country. It is essentially a very large lightning rod of pure\r\ncopper, grounded by means of a broad copper conductor. Such rods have\r\nbeen installed, in some cases, on church steeples and other tall\r\nedifices, including the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, and in other cases\r\non tall steel towers erected for this purpose. This device is called\r\nfantastically an “electric Niagara,” because, according to the claims\r\nof its promoters, it draws down “torrents” of electricity from the\r\nclouds. Hundreds of these “Niagaras” have been constructed in France.\r\nSome of them are set up in rows, or so-called _barrages_, across\r\nthe habitual paths of hailstorms. The French Government was induced\r\nto appoint a “Comité de Défense contre la Grêle” (Hail-protection\r\nCommittee), which before the war had made elaborate plans for\r\n“protecting” not only the whole of France, but also Algeria and Tunis,\r\nwith these devices. Similar rods have been erected in Argentina, and\r\nplans for introducing them in South Africa were near consummation at\r\nthe time the World War broke out.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the extraordinary hold that the various\r\nhail-protecting devices have taken upon the minds of European\r\ncultivators it should be remembered that the intensive cultivation\r\nof the soil is the rule over the greater part of Europe, so that a\r\nhailstorm of relatively small extent often does enormous damage.\r\nVineyards are especially subject to injury from this cause, and many\r\nof the richest vine-growing districts of the Old World are notoriously\r\nafflicted with hailstorms.\r\n\r\nScientific commissions appointed by the Austrian and Italian\r\ngovernments conducted long series of tests of the methods of bombarding\r\nthe clouds with mortars, bombs, and rockets, and declared them to\r\nbe of no value. The erection of hail rods, though it has received a\r\ncertain amount of official encouragement in France, is also strongly\r\ndiscountenanced by the majority of scientific men, as well as by\r\na large proportion of intelligent agriculturists. Reports on the\r\nactual operation of the rods support conflicting opinions--as might\r\nbe expected from the fact that the hailstorm is a decidedly erratic\r\nphenomenon. Thus, some observers claim that the storm clouds change\r\nconspicuously in appearance as they approach a “Niagara,” and if they\r\nshed hail upon the spot it is in a soft and harmless form. Others deny\r\nthe accuracy of these observations, and point to the stubborn fact that\r\nordinary hail has fallen on several of the rods themselves, including\r\nthe one on the Eiffel Tower. In the suburbs of Clermont-Ferrand a\r\n“Niagara” is installed on an iron tower, 100 feet high. This rod was\r\npelted with hail twice in 1912 and four times in 1913, and in one case\r\nthe hailstones attained the size of hen’s eggs! Nobody has ever offered\r\nany plausible scientific hypothesis to explain why these rods should\r\nhave an effect upon hail, even if they are able, as seems unlikely, to\r\nreduce the electrical charge of the clouds; since the formation of hail\r\nis due to movements of the air, which, in turn, are the cause and not\r\nthe result of the charge in question.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the farmer and the horticulturist--especially in\r\nEurope--a method of averting the losses due to hailstorms is available\r\nin the shape of insurance, and its cost is decidedly less than that\r\nentailed in systematic hail-shooting or in the general erection of hail\r\nrods. Hailstorm insurance has been extensively practiced in the Old\r\nWorld since the end of the eighteenth century. In some countries it has\r\nbeen conducted or subsidized by the government. Generally each country\r\nis divided into a number of zones, according to the recorded frequency\r\nof hailstorms, and the premiums vary proportionately. Premiums also\r\nvary for different crops, since some are better able to withstand the\r\neffects of hail than others. The amount of insurance of this kind\r\ncarried in Germany, alone, shortly before the World War, was more than\r\n$800,000,000.\r\n\r\nHailstorm insurance is fairly common in the United States, especially\r\nin the Middle West, but still lacks an adequate statistical basis\r\nin the shape of detailed records of hail frequency. In 1919 growing\r\ncrops in this country were insured against hail to the extent of\r\n$559,134,000. Much information on this subject will be found in V. N.\r\nValgren’s “Hail Insurance on Farm Crops in the United States” (U. S.\r\nDept. of Agriculture, Bulletin 912), published in 1920.\r\n\r\nBesides the weather-making schemes already noted, mention should\r\nbe made of certain more ambitious projects of this character that\r\nhave been bruited from time to time, and that have found plenty of\r\ncredulous supporters. In the year 1845 an American meteorologist of\r\nundoubted ability, but much inclined to the riding of hobbies--viz.,\r\nJames P. Espy--proposed the building of great fires in the western\r\npart of the United States in order to regulate the winds and rainfall\r\nto the eastward. The fires were to extend in a line of six or seven\r\nhundred miles from north to south, and were to be set off once a week\r\nthroughout the summer. Another genius, of less celebrity, proposed to\r\ndestroy blizzards by means of a line of coal stoves along the northern\r\nboundary of the country. A favorite idea of those who aspire to produce\r\nwholesale changes of climate is to alter the course of ocean currents\r\nfor this purpose. One early plan contemplated the damming of the Strait\r\nof Belle Isle in order to improve the climate of New England and the\r\nCanadian provinces; while, a few years since, a proposal to build an\r\nimmense jetty eastward from Newfoundland for the purpose of “protecting\r\nthe warm north-flowing Gulf Stream from the onslaughts of the ice-cold,\r\nsouth-flowing Labrador Current” actually received, serious attention\r\nfrom the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC BYWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. IGNIS FATUUS, OR WILL-O’-THE-WISP\r\n\r\nWill-o’-the-wisp is proverbially elusive. It has thus far escaped the\r\nfate of the rainbow, deplored by Keats. We do not know its woof and\r\ntexture, and it is not given in the dull catalogue of common things.\r\n\r\nA strong argument in favor of the reality of this phenomenon is found\r\nin the great number of names that have been applied to it. There are\r\nforty or fifty in the British dialects alone. A myth generally carries\r\nits nomenclature with it, as it spreads from one community to another,\r\nwhile a fact of nature may give rise to a variety of local names.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that a great many different phenomena have\r\nbeen described as will-o’-the-wisp. Some of these are: (1) The\r\nphosphorescence of decaying wood (“fox fire”) and other vegetable\r\nmatter. This is due to luminous fungi. According to H. Molisch there\r\nare some forty-five species of fungi, including twenty species of\r\nbacteria, that have the property of luminosity. Sometimes the ground\r\nunder a forest is illuminated on all sides with a soft, white light\r\nfrom decaying leaves. (2) Fireflies, including glowworms (the wingless\r\nfemales of the firefly and the larvæ). (3) Luminous birds and animals.\r\nTheir luminosity is supposed to be due to parasitic fungi. Certain\r\nspecies of skunk have been described as giving off in the darkness a\r\ncontinuous flame, the head being fiery red, which blends into a bright\r\nblue at the tail. (4) Ball lightning. (5) St. Elmo’s fire. (6) Moving\r\nlanterns, distant lights of houses, and other lights due to human\r\nagency. (7) Burning gas ascending from marshes, stagnant pools, and the\r\nlike. Marsh gas and other inflammable gases commonly rise from such\r\nplaces, and are often ignited by man, or by lightning, etc. Such fires\r\nare sometimes seen by day as well as by night. (8) Burning naphtha\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nExcluding the numerous reported cases of will-o’-the-wisp in which the\r\nphenomenon may be plausibly identified with one of those mentioned\r\nabove, there remain several cases, some of them reported by very\r\ncareful observers, which appear to belong to a different category. The\r\nreports in question differ somewhat in details, but yield the following\r\ncomposite description:\r\n\r\nSmall luminous bodies, “about as large as your fist,” or “the size of\r\na candle flame,” are seen hovering a few feet above the ground; not\r\nonly over marshes and pools, but also over dry land. Sometimes they\r\nare stationary; at other times they appear to drift with the wind, or\r\neven to move independently. They appear and disappear, after the manner\r\nof fireflies. They do not set fire to objects with which they come in\r\ncontact, and are believed to be without sensible heat. Their color\r\nis most often described as bluish, but may be yellow, purple, green,\r\netc.; rarely pure white. They are without odor and without smoke.\r\nTraditionally they are associated with graveyards, but in very few of\r\nthe cases heretofore recorded were they actually seen in such places.\r\nThe popular idea that they flee from the traveler who tries to approach\r\nthem and follow him when he seeks to avoid them is also unsupported by\r\nthe evidence thus far adduced.\r\n\r\nOne of the most circumstantial accounts of these objects is that\r\npublished in the Belgian journal “Ciel et Terre” for July-August,\r\n1920, by a retired army surgeon, Jules Rossignol, who observed them\r\nrepeatedly in the autumn of 1908 in and about some marshy woods near\r\nGrupont. They were generally seen to rise from the ground, at first\r\nin the shape of little white clouds, which changed to luminous globes\r\non attaining an altitude of a dozen yards, and returned by a circular\r\npath toward the ground. They lasted from one to several minutes before\r\ndisappearing in the air.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing that the phenomenon of _ignis fatuus_, though\r\nreported from so many parts of the world, has not yet been made the\r\nsubject of direct scientific examination. Nobody has ever studied\r\nits light with the spectroscope, for example. Chemists have, indeed,\r\nattempted to reproduce the phenomenon, yet the chemical explanations\r\nof it that have appeared in reference books down to a recent date\r\nare quite untenable. It has sometimes been attributed to marsh gas\r\n(methane, CH4), and sometimes to phosphureted hydrogen (phosphine,\r\nPH3). But marsh gas, besides not being spontaneously combustible,\r\ndiffuses too rapidly in the air to produce the effects described,\r\nwhile phosphureted hydrogen, though it takes fire spontaneously in the\r\nair, produces thick wreaths of smoke when burning and has a powerful\r\nodor--features never reported in connection with will-o’-the-wisp.\r\n\r\nAt least two more plausible explanations of _ignis fatuus_ have been\r\noffered in the last few years. Mr. F. Sanford (“Scientific Monthly,”\r\nOct., 1919) believes that it is due to “swarms of luminous bacteria\r\nwhich are carried up from the bottom of the marsh by rising bubbles of\r\ngas.” A Belgian chemist, M. Léon Dumas (“La Nature,” Dec. 11, 1909),\r\nclaims to have produced little luminous clouds, corresponding to the\r\ntraditional descriptions of will-o’-the-wisp, by combining the two\r\ngases sulphureted hydrogen and phosphine. Both these substances are\r\nproduced in the decay of animal matter, especially of the brain and\r\nspinal cord. The body of an animal, buried in some wet place, would\r\naccumulate the two gases under pressure in the skull and spinal canal,\r\nand their escape, simultaneously, would fulfill the conditions of M.\r\nDumas’ experiments.\r\n\r\n(At the request of the present writer, these experiments were repeated\r\nat the Bureau of Standards, in Washington, with only partial success.\r\nFurther trials with these and other gases due to putrefaction are\r\ndesirable.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE RAIN TREE\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the newspapers publish accounts of a wonderful tree,\r\nsaid to grow wild in Peru or elsewhere, from the leaves of which falls\r\na continuous shower of rain, even in the driest weather. The writers\r\ngenerally urge the introduction of this tree in regions where the\r\nrainfall is deficient, and a so-called “rain tree” has actually been\r\nsold for this purpose by nurserymen.\r\n\r\nThe story of this tree is very old. Early voyagers reported finding it\r\nin the East Indies, Guinea, Brazil, and especially the island of Ferro,\r\nin the Canaries. Nowadays the name “rain tree” is applied especially\r\nto a magnificent tree of tropical America generally known to botanists\r\nas _Pithecolobium_ (or _Enterolobium_) _saman_. One of its common names\r\nis “guango.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAIN TREE\r\n\r\nFrom “Voyageurs anciens et modernes”\r\n\r\n(_By E. T. Charton_)\r\n\r\nA legendary scene in the island of Ferro]\r\n\r\nThat many plants spontaneously exude moisture under suitable conditions\r\nis well known. The phenomenon is called “guttation.” The moisture drawn\r\nup from the roots is usually transpired from the leaves in the form\r\nof invisible water vapor; i. e., it is evaporated on passing into the\r\nair. If, however, the humidity of the surrounding air is sufficiently\r\nhigh, or its temperature sufficiently low, to check evaporation, the\r\nwater will collect on the surface of the plant in liquid form, and may\r\nultimately trickle to the ground in considerable quantities. Guttation\r\noccurs chiefly at night, or in cloudy or foggy weather. In a very dry\r\nclimate it does not occur at all; and for this reason, even if the\r\nso-called rain tree could be successfully introduced in such a climate,\r\nit would not help solve the problem of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe dripping of moisture deposited on plants by drifting fog is\r\nanother common process that may have contributed to the legend of\r\nthe rain tree. A classic example of this process--technically called\r\n“fog drip”--is that described by Dr. R. Marloth, who has made actual\r\nmeasurements of the abundant moisture captured by the vegetation of\r\nTable Mountain, South Africa, from the driving clouds of the southeast\r\ntrade winds during the nearly rainless summer months. Mr. Madison\r\nGrant, writing of a similar phenomenon witnessed in the redwood forests\r\nof California, tells us that “these forests are sometimes so wet that\r\nthe dripping from the high crowns is like a thin rain, and in summer it\r\nis oftentimes hard to tell whether it is raining or not, so saturated\r\nwith moisture are the foliage and the trunks when the fog darkens the\r\nforest.”\r\n\r\nA copious production of “honeydew” by plant lice, scale insects, etc.,\r\nmay be at the bottom of some of the rain-tree stories. F. E. Lutz, in\r\nhis “Field Book of Insects,” writes of “weeping trees,” which drip\r\nfluid of insect origin, and he says of the honeydew secreted by the\r\npear psylla (_Psylla pyricola_): “When the psyllas are numerous the\r\nleaves and fruit become coated with this sticky substance and it even\r\ndrops from them like rain and runs down the trunk.”\r\n\r\nThe following account of the Peruvian rain tree, quoted from the\r\ntraveler Spruce, was published in “Nature” of Feb. 28, 1878, by Prof.\r\nThiselton Dyer:\r\n\r\n“The Tamia-caspi, or rain tree of the eastern Peruvian Andes, is not\r\na myth, but a fact, although not exactly in the way popular rumor has\r\npresented it. I first witnessed the phenomenon in September, 1855,\r\nwhen residing at Tarapoto. I had gone one morning at daybreak, with\r\ntwo assistants, into the adjacent wooded hills to botanize. A little\r\nafter seven o’clock we came under a lowish spreading tree, from which\r\nwith a perfectly clear sky over-head a smart rain was falling. A glance\r\nupward showed a multitude of cicadas, sucking the juices of the tender\r\nyoung branches and leaves and squirting forth slender streams of limpid\r\nfluid.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DEW PONDS\r\n\r\nThe Down country of southern England is one of the few places in the\r\nworld where the people go to the hilltops to seek water in dry weather.\r\nOn the summits of the Downs are found many artificial shallow ponds,\r\nmost of them very old. Some, indeed, date back to prehistoric times.\r\nThe bottom of these ponds consists of a layer of puddled chalk or clay\r\nand is impervious to water, so that there is no loss by seepage. As\r\nthe ponds are not fed by springs or surface drainage, and as lack of\r\nrain does not cause them to dry up, it is popularly believed that their\r\nmaintenance depends upon dew. Hence they are called “dew ponds.”\r\n\r\nKipling mentions them in his poetical description of Sussex:\r\n\r\n  We have no waters to delight\r\n    Our broad and brookless vales--\r\n  Only the dew pond on the height\r\n    Unfed, that never fails.\r\n\r\nThe leading authority on dew ponds is Mr. Edward A. Martin, who has\r\nwritten a book about them. Mr. Martin’s experiments have demonstrated\r\nthat dew can make no important contribution to the water supply of\r\nthese ponds. The rainfall on the hilltops is somewhat higher than\r\nin the valleys, and the greater part of the water in the ponds is\r\nundoubtedly derived from this source. The real key to the mystery,\r\nhowever, is found in the wet fogs that drift in from the sea. The\r\nprocess of “fog drip,” which we have mentioned in connection with the\r\nrain tree, supplies the deficiencies of the rainfall, and the name\r\n“mist ponds,” occasionally applied to these bodies of water, is more\r\nappropriate than “dew ponds.”\r\n\r\nIt remains, however, an interesting paradox that, in time of drought,\r\nthe farmers of the Downs drive their cattle to the hilltops to be\r\nwatered and send their carts uphill to procure water for household\r\nuse in the valleys below. Was it, perhaps, in this topsy-turvy\r\nregion--where uplands are called “downs”--that Jack and Jill went “up\r\nthe hill” on their ill-starred water quest?\r\n\r\n\r\n4. BLOWING WELLS\r\n\r\nWells that predict weather changes are local curiosities in many parts\r\nof the world. Such wells are not uncommon in the United States. If the\r\nwell is open at the top, its manifestations consist of occasional\r\ndisturbance of the water and the discharge of numerous bubbles. If it\r\nis covered, a strong current of air is, at times, emitted from any\r\nsmall orifice in the cover. This may be strong enough to lift and blow\r\naway light objects placed over the aperture. Its emission is frequently\r\naccompanied by a loud whistling or roaring sound. Such occurrences\r\nare supposed to betoken an approaching storm. These wells are called\r\n“blowing wells”; sometimes “weather wells” or “barometer wells.”\r\n\r\nIn certain cases an indraft of air is sometimes observed; i. e., the\r\nwell alternately “sucks” and “blows.”\r\n\r\nAs a rule these phenomena correspond to fluctuations in barometric\r\npressure, and therefore are, in a rough way, indicative of changes in\r\nweather. It is obvious that a body of air inclosed in the earth and\r\ncommunicating by one or a few small openings with the air above will\r\nset up outdrafts and indrafts in adjusting its tension to that of\r\nthe latter. The amount of air contained in the well itself would not\r\nsuffice to produce the violent effects observed and it is therefore\r\nassumed that the typical blowing well taps a subterranean reservoir of\r\nair, probably filling the interstices of sand and gravel beds. When\r\nthe pressure of the external air is diminished, some of the imprisoned\r\nair escapes. For a given body of inclosed air, the smaller the channel\r\nor channels by which it emerges, the stronger the outdraft. When the\r\nbarometric pressure outside increases, the current of air flows in the\r\nreverse direction. In winter the indraft of cold air in such a well\r\nsometimes causes the water to freeze, even at a depth of 100 feet or\r\nmore below the surface of the ground, and is therefore a source of\r\ninconvenience to the owner.\r\n\r\nVarious other circumstances may give rise to the bubbling and blowing\r\nof wells. Carbon dioxide and other gases dissolved in the well water\r\naccount for the bubbling of many wells, and this process is more active\r\nat times of low barometric pressure, because at a given temperature,\r\nthe amount of gas that the water can hold in solution varies with the\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the blowing of a well is, in some cases, a sudden rise\r\nin the water level (“water table”) in the surrounding ground, as after\r\na heavy rainstorm. If the ground is overlain by an impervious stratum,\r\nthe air imprisoned between this stratum and the surface of the ground\r\nwater over an extensive area will escape with violence through any\r\navailable channel, such as that supplied by the well.\r\n\r\nLastly, cases have been described in which subterranean air currents\r\narise from the friction of rapidly flowing underground streams, setting\r\nup permanent indrafts or outdrafts through wells communicating with\r\nsuch streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. CURIOUS SHOWERS.\r\n\r\nShowers of blood, sulphur, manna, frogs, fishes, and what not figure\r\nin all the old chronicles, and are still frequently reported. Many\r\noccurrences of this kind are recorded in Camille Flammarion’s book “The\r\nAtmosphere,” Dr. E. E. Free’s “Movement of Soil Material by the Wind”\r\n(U. S. Bureau of Soils, Bulletin 68), and Mr. W. L. McAtee’s article\r\n“Showers of Organic Matter” in the “Monthly Weather Review” for May,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nThe power of the wind to whirl objects aloft is a matter of familiar\r\nobservation. McAtee tells of seeing a silk hat lifted from its owner’s\r\nhead and blown over a ten-story building in the city of Washington.\r\nThe vortex of a tornado or a waterspout furnishes the most favorable\r\nskyward route for things that belong on _terra firma_. Objects weighing\r\nscores or even hundreds of pounds are lifted by these whirls. Within\r\na mile or so of a tornado a shower of cart wheels or cook stoves\r\nwould not necessarily constitute a “prodigy.” A chicken coop weighing\r\n75 pounds has been carried four miles and a church spire seventeen\r\nmiles. Oersted tells of a waterspout at Christiansö, on the Baltic,\r\nthat emptied the harbor to such an extent that the greater part of the\r\nbottom was uncovered, while McAtee says that “waterspouts have been\r\nobserved to accomplish the comparatively insignificant feat of emptying\r\nfish ponds and scattering their occupants.”\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, no mystery about the way in which terrestrial\r\nobjects of many sorts get into the air; nor, considering the force\r\nof the winds and their occasional strong vertical components, is it\r\nstrange that such objects sometimes travel a long way from home before\r\nthey return to earth.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a great many cases of reported showers in which the\r\nobjects did not really fall, as supposed. McAtee gives the following\r\naccount of these spurious showers in the “Monthly Weather Review”:\r\n\r\n“_Insect larvæ._--The rains of insect larvæ that have been investigated\r\nhave proved to be merely the appearance in large numbers on the\r\nsurface of the ground or upon snow of the larvæ of soldier beetles\r\n(_Telephorus_), or sometimes caterpillars, which have been driven from\r\ntheir hibernating quarters by the saturation of the soil by heavy rains\r\nor melting snow.\r\n\r\n“_Ants._--Accounts of showers of ants have usually been founded on\r\nincursions of large numbers of winged ants, which of course needs no\r\nassistance from the elements to follow out their habit of swarming\r\nforth periodically in immense numbers.\r\n\r\n“_Honey; sugar._--Showers of honey and of sugar are popular names for\r\nwhat scientists know are exudations of certain plants, or of plant lice\r\nwhich feed on a great variety of plants and whose product is often\r\nknown also as honeydew.\r\n\r\n“_Grains._--Showers of grain, usually considered miraculous, have in\r\nmost cases been determined to be merely the accumulation by washing\r\nduring heavy rains of either the seeds or root tubercles of plants of\r\nthe immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\n“_Manna._--An account of manna ‘rains’ certainly pertains to the\r\ndiscussion of showers of vegetable matter, for the substance manna\r\nconsists of lichens of the genus _Lecanora_ but in none of the numerous\r\nrecorded instances of manna ‘rains’ is there any direct evidence that\r\nthe substance really fell from the sky. These lichens form small,\r\nround bodies that are easily blown over the surface of the ground and\r\naccumulate in depressions; they are very buoyant also and hence easily\r\ndrifted into masses during the run-off of rain water. Manna ‘rains’\r\nhave not occurred except in countries where these lichens are common,\r\nand as for statements of their falling down upon roofs or upon people,\r\nor for any other proofs that they really rained down, I have seen none.\r\n\r\n“_Blood rains._--The most frequently reported showers that are\r\nspurious, at least in name, are the so-called blood rains. In all\r\ntimes the phenomena going under this name have frightened the people\r\nand have been taken as portents of terrific calamities. One of the\r\nfamous plagues of Egypt was a bloody rain which prevailed throughout\r\nthe whole land, continuing three days and three nights. Homer and\r\nVirgil both allude to blood rains, and, in fact, the general subject of\r\npreternatural rains was a favorite with the older writers.\r\n\r\n“But scientific investigation has done away with the element of\r\nmystery in these phenomena and has explained, with the others, the\r\nrains of blood. Some blood rains have been found to be the meconial\r\nfluid ejected by large numbers of certain lepidoptera simultaneously\r\nemerging from their chrysalides; other red rains are due to the rapid\r\nmultiplication in rain pools of algæ and of rotifers containing red\r\ncoloring matter; “red snow” results from the presence of similar\r\norganisms. But in no case have they rained down, except in the sense\r\nthat their spores or eggs have at some time been transported, probably\r\nby the wind. The precipitation of moisture furnishes favorable\r\nconditions for their rapid development and multiplication.”\r\n\r\nMost of the reported showers of blood, however, have probably been\r\nrainstorms in which the rain was colored with reddish dust. The\r\noccurrence of such dust in the atmosphere is very common in some parts\r\nof the world, as we have stated in a previous chapter. It has been\r\nasserted that rain which fell at Oppido Mamertina, Italy, May 15, 1890,\r\nactually contained blood, believed to be from birds.\r\n\r\nShowers of supposed “sulphur” are due to pollen, chiefly from pine\r\ntrees. The air in the vicinity of pine forests is sometimes filled with\r\nclouds of this material and the wind carries it for many miles. It is\r\nreported that a pollen shower at Pictou, Nova Scotia, in June, 1841,\r\nwas so heavy that bucketfuls were swept up on a ship.\r\n\r\nIn the case of alleged showers of “paper” the material has been found\r\nto be the crusts of dried algæ, which form on the surface of the ground\r\nexposed by the evaporation of the water of shallow ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE YEAR WITHOUT A SUMMER\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau is a bureau of information, and one of the ways\r\nin which it strives to give a good account of itself is by answering\r\nendless questions about “the year without a summer.” This title has\r\nbeen given to the year 1816.\r\n\r\nBlodget, in his “Climatology of the United States,” tells us that all\r\nthe summers from 1811 to 1817 were cold in this country, and that in\r\nevery month of the summers of both 1812 and 1816 snows and frosts\r\noccurred in the Northern States. It is the latter summer, however,\r\nthat has lived in popular tradition. The year 1816 is known further as\r\n“poverty year,” or “eighteen hundred and froze to death.” It acquired\r\nthe name of “mackerel year” in New Hampshire, where people ate mackerel\r\nas a substitute for pork, little of which was fattened on account of\r\nthe extreme scarcity of corn. Western Europe, also, had a cold summer\r\nin 1816, and the year as a whole seems to have been a cold one over a\r\ngreat part of the world.\r\n\r\nSources of information about the cold summer in this country, besides\r\nBlodget’s book above mentioned, include Perley’s “Historic Storms\r\nof New England,” which devotes a whole chapter to the subject, and\r\nCharles Peirce’s “Weather in Philadelphia.” Peirce tells us that\r\nat Philadelphia “there was ice during every month of the year, not\r\nexcepting June, July, and August, There was scarcely a vegetable\r\ncame to perfection north and east of the Potomac.” According to the\r\n“Monthly Weather Review,” citing the recollections of James Winchester,\r\nof Vermont: “It is said that in June of that year snow fell to the\r\ndepth of three inches in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey on the\r\n17th; five inches in all the New England States, except three inches\r\nin Vermont. There was snow and ice in every month of this year. The\r\nstorm of June 17 was as severe as any that ever occurred in the depth\r\nof winter; it began about noon, increasing in fury until night, by\r\nwhich time the roads were impassable by reason of snowdrifts; many were\r\nbewildered in the blinding storm and frozen to death.... There was\r\na heavy snowstorm August 30th.... The year 1816 had neither spring,\r\nsummer, nor autumn. The only crop of corn raised in that part of\r\nVermont that summer was saved by keeping bonfires burning around the\r\ncornfield night and day.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of its occurrence the frigid weather of the summer of 1816\r\nwas popularly attributed to sun spots, which were big enough to be seen\r\nwith the naked eye in May and June. A present-day hypothesis on the\r\nsubject has been mentioned in our chapter on atmospheric dust. The dust\r\ncloud from the eruption of Tomboro, in 1815, was so vast that for three\r\ndays there was darkness at a distance of 300 miles from the volcano.\r\n\r\nA proximate cause of the cold summer is perhaps to be sought in an\r\nunusual intensity and extent of the area of low barometric pressure\r\nwhich is more or less permanently located in the vicinity of Iceland\r\nand, as one of the principal atmospheric “centers of action,” has a\r\ngreat deal to say about the weather of the countries adjacent to the\r\nNorth Atlantic. Dr. C. F. Brooks has called attention to the fact that\r\nthe Arctic navigator, Scoresby, found unusually mild and open weather\r\nthat summer in the seas east of Greenland. This would be explained\r\nby strong southerly winds, forming part of the “counter-clockwise”\r\ncirculation around the Iceland low; and if the same pressure system\r\nextended its influence to our shores, persistent cold northwest winds\r\nmight be expected to result over the northeastern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. INDIAN SUMMER AND THE ICE SAINTS\r\n\r\nIndian summer _weather_ is an undeniable fact. Every inhabitant of\r\nthe northern United States and southern Canada is familiar with the\r\nmild, calm, hazy state of the atmosphere that frequently occurs in the\r\nautumn, sometimes following a brief period of unseasonable cold known\r\nas “squaw winter.” It is, however, one thing to recognize the existence\r\nof a certain type of weather as characteristic of our autumns, and\r\nquite another to admit that one definite spell of such weather occurs\r\nmore or less regularly from year to year. One true summer, and only\r\none, comes to pass each year, and occupies an approximately fixed place\r\nin the calendar. Even the so-called “year without a summer,” which we\r\nhave just described, was merely a year in which the regular annual\r\nrise of the temperature curve was less marked than usual. Indian\r\nsummer, on the contrary, has never been tied down to a particular part\r\nof a particular month. In his notes on the meteorological conditions\r\nat Concord, Massachusetts, during the ten years, 1851-1860, Thoreau\r\nrecords the occurrence of Indian summer weather on dates all the way\r\nfrom September 27 to December 13; a range of 77 days.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the definite occurrence, year after year, of what has\r\nsometimes been called the “after-summer” is not peculiar to America. It\r\nprevails also in Europe, where this supposed period of renewed warmth\r\nhas been assigned to certain dates, owing in part to its association\r\nwith the names of particular saints in the calendar. These dates vary\r\nwidely, however, from one region to another, ranging from August 15\r\n(Julian calendar), the beginning of the “young women’s summer” of\r\nRussia, to November 15, St. Martin’s day, a date popularly associated\r\nwith after-summer in Germany, Holland, France, Italy, and sometimes\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe supposed tendency of particular types of weather to occur at\r\nabout the same period every year, independently of and often in sharp\r\ncontrast to the regular march of the seasons, has been described by\r\nR. Abercromby under the name of “recurrence,” and there is a large\r\nliterature on the subject; especially in connection with periods of\r\nunseasonable temperature. While Indian summer is the most discussed\r\nexample of recurrence in the American weather calendar, in the Old\r\nWorld more attention, both popular and scientific, has been devoted\r\nto a frosty period supposed to recur in May. With the elaboration of\r\nthe ecclesiastical calendar, the frosts in question became definitely\r\nassociated with the days dedicated to Saints Mamertus, Pancras,\r\nand Servatius (May 11, 12, 13), or, in south-central Europe, Saints\r\nPancras, Servatius, and Boniface (May 12, 13, 14), hence known as the\r\nIce Saints. These saints and their days are called in French _saints de\r\nglace_, and in German _Eisheiligen_, _Eismänner_, or _gestrenge Herren_.\r\n\r\nYet other examples of the elusive phenomenon of recurrence are the\r\n“January thaw” of New England, the April “blackthorn winter” of\r\nEngland, and the June “sheep-cold” (_Schafkälte_) of Germany, dangerous\r\nto newly shorn sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century the cold weather of the Ice Saints\r\nwas variously ascribed to the melting of the ice and snow of high\r\nlatitudes, the passage of periodic meteor showers between the earth and\r\nthe sun, and other far-reaching terrestrial or cosmical causes. FitzRoy\r\nbelieved that the liberation of latent heat in autumn during the\r\nformation of ice in the circumpolar regions was accountable for Indian\r\nsummer. A review of the whole body of literature concerning supposed\r\nrecurrent irregularities in the annual march of temperature will be\r\nfound in the “Monthly Weather Review” (Washington) for August, 1919.\r\n\r\nWhether recurrence, in Abercromby’s sense of the term, is a\r\nreal phenomenon is still an unsettled question. Many periods of\r\nunseasonable weather occur in the course of each year, and it is easy\r\nfor the uncritical observer to identify one of them with the Ice\r\nSaints, another with Indian summer, and so on. About the best that\r\nmeteorologists can do at present is to explain each particular instance\r\nof such weather by reference to barometric and other conditions shown\r\non the daily weather map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vast vocabulary of meteorology is very inadequately represented\r\nin ordinary dictionaries, and has never been made the subject of a\r\ncomprehensive special glossary. The writer of this book has been\r\ngathering material toward such a glossary for some years, and from the\r\nmaterial now in hand it appears that an approximately complete English\r\nmeteorological dictionary, embracing both scientific and nonscientific\r\nterms relating to the atmosphere and its phenomena, would contain\r\nupward of fifteen thousand definitions.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement it will be evident that the brief glossary herewith\r\nappended is of the most fragmentary character. It includes only a\r\nselection of the _meteorological_ terms found in the present book. It\r\ndoes not, in general, include terms pertaining primarily to physics,\r\nchemistry, astronomy, physiology, etc., even though they figure to some\r\nextent in meteorology, as all such terms used in the book are more\r\nor less satisfactorily defined in the latest editions of the large\r\nAmerican dictionaries.\r\n\r\n    _Absolute Extremes._--The highest and lowest values of a\r\n    meteorological element (especially temperature) that have ever\r\n    been recorded at a station; known, respectively, as the _absolute\r\n    maximum_ and the _absolute minimum_. (The term is sometimes\r\n    improperly applied to the highest and lowest values for a specified\r\n    year.)\r\n\r\n    _Aeroclinoscope._--A semaphore formerly used in Holland for\r\n    displaying weather signals.\r\n\r\n    _Aerology._--The branch of meteorology dealing with the “free”\r\n    atmosphere; i. e., all parts of the atmosphere not near the earth’s\r\n    surface. Aerological investigations are made with kites and\r\n    balloons, and also include observations of clouds, meteor trails,\r\n    the aurora, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Afterglow._--1. The glow in the western sky after sunset. 2. A\r\n    renewal of rosy light on mountain peaks after the first sunset\r\n    illumination has faded; also called _recoloration_. This is one\r\n    stage of the _Alpenglow_.\r\n\r\n    _After-summer._--A renewal of mild weather in the autumn; called\r\n    Indian summer in America, St. Martin’s summer, etc., in Europe.\r\n\r\n    _Alpenglow._--Successive appearances and disappearances of rosy\r\n    light sometimes seen on mountain peaks in clear weather after\r\n    sunset or before sunrise.\r\n\r\n    _Altimeter._--A barometer used for measuring altitude.\r\n\r\n    _Alto-cumulus_; _Alto-stratus_.--Forms of cloud. (See Chapter VI.)\r\n\r\n    _Anemogram._--The record traced by a self-registering anemometer.\r\n\r\n    _Anemometer._--An instrument for measuring the force or speed of\r\n    the wind.\r\n\r\n    _Aneroid Barometer._--A barometer consisting of a thin-walled metal\r\n    vacuum-box, which changes its shape with changes of atmospheric\r\n    pressure. The movements of the box are communicated, by levers, to\r\n    an index or (in the barograph) to a recording pen.\r\n\r\n    _Anthelion._--A rare species of halo, consisting of a brilliant,\r\n    usually white image of the sun opposite the latter in azimuth.\r\n    (This term has also been applied to the _glory_, q. v.)\r\n\r\n    _Anticrepuscular Rays._--The continuation of the crepuscular rays\r\n    converging toward a point in the sky opposite to the sun.\r\n\r\n    _Anticyclone._--An area of high barometric pressure and its\r\n    attendant system of winds. (Cf. _cyclone_.)\r\n\r\n    _Antitrades._--Term formerly applied to the prevailing westerly\r\n    winds of middle latitudes, but now more frequently applied to the\r\n    westerly return-currents lying over the trade winds. Some writers\r\n    prefer to call the former the _antitrades_ and the latter the\r\n    _countertrades_.\r\n\r\n    _Antitwilight Arch._--The pink or purplish zone of illumination\r\n    bordering the shadow of the earth (_dark segment_) in the part of\r\n    the sky opposite the sun after sunset and before sunrise.\r\n\r\n    _Arcs of Lowitz._--A pair of rare halo phenomena. These arcs are\r\n    directed obliquely downward from the parhelia of 22 degrees on\r\n    either side of the sun toward the halo of 22 degrees.\r\n\r\n    _Astraphobia._--A pathological condition experienced by certain\r\n    persons before and during thunderstorms.\r\n\r\n    _Atmometer._--An instrument for measuring evaporation; also called\r\n    _atmidometer_, _evaporimeter_, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Aureole._--(See _corona_. 1).\r\n\r\n    _Aurora._--A luminous phenomenon due to electrical discharges\r\n    in the atmosphere; probably confined to the tenuous air of high\r\n    altitudes. It is most commonly seen in sub-Arctic and sub-Antarctic\r\n    latitudes. Called _aurora borealis_ or _aurora australis_,\r\n    according to the hemisphere in which it occurs. Observations with\r\n    the spectroscope seem to indicate that a faint “permanent aurora”\r\n    is a normal feature of the sky in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n    “_Backstays of the Sun._”--A sailor’s name for crepuscular rays\r\n    extending downward from the sun.\r\n\r\n    _Baguio._--The name current in the Philippines for a tropical\r\n    cyclone.\r\n\r\n    _Ballistic Wind._--A military term applied to a fictitious wind\r\n    which, if affecting a projectile throughout its flight, would\r\n    produce the same total effect in deflecting it from its course\r\n    and altering its range as do the various winds that it actually\r\n    encounters.\r\n\r\n    _Ballon-sonde._--A sounding-balloon.\r\n\r\n    _Bar._--A unit of pressure equal to 1,000,000 dynes per square\r\n    centimeter. A bar = 100 _centibars_ = 1,000 _millibars_. A\r\n    barometric pressure of one bar is sometimes called a “C. G. S.\r\n    atmosphere,” and is equivalent to a pressure of 29.531 inches of\r\n    mercury at 32 degree F. and in latitude 45 degrees.\r\n\r\n    _Barisal Gun._--Same as _brontide_.\r\n\r\n    _Barocyclonometer._--One of several instruments that have been\r\n    devised for locating tropical hurricanes without the aid of a\r\n    weather map.\r\n\r\n    _Barograph._--A self-registering barometer.\r\n\r\n    _Barometer._--An instrument for measuring the pressure of the\r\n    atmosphere. The two principal types are the _mercurial_ and the\r\n    _aneroid_. The _microbarometer_ is used to show minute changes\r\n    of pressure. Certain forms of hygroscope are popularly miscalled\r\n    “barometers.”\r\n\r\n    _Barometer Well._--Same as _blowing well_.\r\n\r\n    _Barometric Tendency._--The change of barometric pressure within\r\n    a specified time (usually three hours) before one of the regular\r\n    observations.\r\n\r\n    _Beaufort Scale._--A scale of wind force, originally devised for\r\n    use at sea, but now used also on land. The scale runs from 0 = calm\r\n    to = hurricane. Many other scales are similarly employed in the\r\n    noninstrumental observation of wind force.\r\n\r\n    _Bioclimatic Law._--A phenological law, announced by Dr. A. D.\r\n    Hopkins, according to which periodical events of plant and animal\r\n    life advance over the United States at the rate of 1 degree of\r\n    latitude, 5 degrees of longitude, and 400 feet of altitude every\r\n    four days--northward, eastward, and up-ward in spring, and\r\n    southward, westward, and downward in autumn.\r\n\r\n    _Bishop’s Ring._--A large corona due to fine dust in the\r\n    atmosphere. It has been seen after certain great volcanic\r\n    eruptions, especially that of Krakatoa, in 1883.\r\n\r\n    _Blizzard._--A violent, intensely cold wind, laden with snow.\r\n\r\n    _Blowing Well._--A well which emits a strong current of air\r\n    from any small opening in its cover during a fall of barometric\r\n    pressure. During a rise of barometric pressure such wells are\r\n    sometimes observed to “suck.” Wells that are thus responsive to\r\n    barometric changes are sometimes called “barometer wells” or\r\n    “weather wells.”\r\n\r\n    _Bora._--A cold wind of the northern Adriatic, blowing down from\r\n    the high plateaus to the northward. Also, a similar wind on the\r\n    northeastern coast of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n    _Brave West Winds._--The boisterous westerly winds blowing over the\r\n    ocean between latitudes 40 and 50 degrees S. This region is known\r\n    as the “roaring forties.”\r\n\r\n    _Bright Segment._--The broad band of golden light that, in clear\r\n    weather, borders the western horizon just after sunset and the\r\n    eastern just before sunrise.\r\n\r\n    _Brontide._--A sound resembling a distant muffled detonation,\r\n    usually indefinite as to direction. Brontides are rather common\r\n    in certain parts of the world. They are called _mistpoeffers_ on\r\n    the Belgian coast, _Barisal guns_ in the Ganges delta, _bulldag_,\r\n    _desert sounds_, or _Hanley’s guns_ in parts of Australia,\r\n    _gouffre_ in Haiti, _Moodus noises_ at Moodus, Connecticut,\r\n    _Nebelzerteiler_, _Seedonner_, _Seeschiessen_, etc., in Germany,\r\n    _baturlio_, _boniti_, _bombiti_, etc., in Italy. These sounds are\r\n    probably of subterranean origin in most cases.\r\n\r\n    _Bump._--An upward jolt experienced by an aviator, as if running\r\n    over an obstruction. A bump may be caused by any condition that\r\n    suddenly increases the lift of the machine, but is perhaps most\r\n    frequently due to rising air currents. Air in which bumps are\r\n    experienced is said to be “bumpy.” (Cf. _hole in the air_.)\r\n\r\n    _Callina._--A Spanish name for dry fog.\r\n\r\n    _Calms of Cancer_; _Calms of Capricorn_.--The belts of high\r\n    pressure lying north of the northeast trade winds and south of the\r\n    southeast trade winds, respectively.\r\n\r\n    _Center of Action._--Any one of several large areas of high and low\r\n    barometric pressure, changing little in location, and persisting\r\n    through a season or through the whole year; e. g., the Iceland\r\n    low, the Siberian winter high, etc. Changes in the intensity and\r\n    positions of these pressure systems are associated with widespread\r\n    weather changes.\r\n\r\n    _Ceraunograph._--A self-registering thunderstorm recorder.\r\n\r\n    _Chinook_, or _Chinook Wind_.--A foehn blowing down the eastern\r\n    slopes of the Rocky Mountains over the adjacent plains, in the\r\n    United States and Canada. In winter, this warm, dry wind causes\r\n    snow to disappear with remarkable rapidity, and hence it has been\r\n    nicknamed the “snow-eater.” (Cf. _foehn_.) The “wet chinook” is a\r\n    wind of a different character, blowing from the Pacific Ocean over\r\n    the northwestern United States.\r\n\r\n    _Circumscribed Halo._--A halo formed by the junction of the upper\r\n    and lower tangent arcs of the halo of 22 degrees, when the luminary\r\n    is about 40 degrees or more above the horizon. As the altitude of\r\n    the luminary increases, the circumscribed halo gradually assumes an\r\n    elliptical form and finally merges into the halo of 22 degrees.\r\n\r\n    _Circumzenithal Arc._--A rainbow-tinted halo, often very bright,\r\n    convex to the luminary and 46 degrees or a little more above it. It\r\n    is sometimes called the _upper quasi-tangent arc of the halo of 46\r\n    degrees_, but the circumzenithal arc and the halo of 46 degrees are\r\n    rarely seen at the same time.\r\n\r\n    _Cirro-cumulus_; _Cirro-stratus_; _Cirrus_.--Forms of cloud. (See\r\n    Chapter VI.)\r\n\r\n    _Cistern._--The cup, containing mercury, at the base of a mercurial\r\n    barometer.\r\n\r\n    _Climatography._--1. Descriptive and statistical climatology. 2. An\r\n    account of the climate of a particular place or region.\r\n\r\n    _Climatology._--1. The science of climate. 2. A body of knowledge\r\n    concerning the climate of any place or region; as, “the climatology\r\n    of Panama.”\r\n\r\n    _Climograph._--A diagram introduced by Dr. Griffith Taylor,\r\n    of Australia, for showing the mean monthly values of wet-bulb\r\n    temperature and relative humidity at any place, and for comparing\r\n    such data as recorded at different places throughout the world;\r\n    especially with reference to the effects of climate on mankind.\r\n    Other pairs of elements can be used in constructing climographs:\r\n    e. g., the dry-bulb temperature and the relative humidity.\r\n\r\n    _Cloud-banner._--A bannerlike cloud streaming off from a mountain\r\n    peak.\r\n\r\n    _Cloud-burst._--A sudden and extremely heavy downpour of rain;\r\n    especially one in which the water falls in a continuous stream\r\n    rather than in drops. The term has been most commonly applied to\r\n    downpours in mountainous regions.\r\n\r\n    _Cloud-cap._--A caplike cloud crowning (1) a mountain summit, or\r\n    (2) another cloud, especially a mass of cumulo-nimbus.\r\n\r\n    _Col._--The neck of low pressure between two anticyclones; also\r\n    called a _saddle_.\r\n\r\n    _Cold Wave._--A rapid and marked fall of temperature during the\r\n    cold season of the year. The United States Weather Bureau applies\r\n    this term to a fall of temperature in 24 hours equaling or\r\n    exceeding a specified number of degrees and reaching a specified\r\n    temperature or lower; the specifications varying for different\r\n    parts of the country and for different periods of the year.\r\n\r\n    _Collector._--A device used in measurements of atmospheric\r\n    electricity for determining the potential gradient.\r\n\r\n    _Continental Climate._--The type of climate characteristic of\r\n    the interior of a continent. As compared with a marine climate,\r\n    a continental climate has a large annual and daily range of\r\n    temperature.\r\n\r\n    _Corona._--1. A colored luminous circular area formed, by\r\n    diffraction; around the sun, moon, or other source of light seen\r\n    through clouds or dust haze. Coronas invariably show a brownish-red\r\n    inner ring, which, together with the bluish-white inner field\r\n    between the ring and the luminary, forms the so-called _aureole_.\r\n    Most frequently the aureole alone is visible. Well developed\r\n    coronas show one or more series of spectral colors outside the\r\n    aureole. 2. A luminous circle formed by the apparent convergence\r\n    of auroral beams about the place in the sky toward which the\r\n    dipping-needle points.\r\n\r\n    _Corposant._--(See _St. Elmo’s fire_.)\r\n\r\n    _Countertrades._--(See _antitrades_.)\r\n\r\n    _Crepuscular Rays._--Beams of light radiating from the sun, seen\r\n    both before and after sunrise and sunset. The beams are made\r\n    visible by the presence of water-drops or dust in the atmosphere,\r\n    and the intervening dark spaces are the shadows of clouds. The\r\n    beams are actually parallel; their apparent divergence is the\r\n    result of perspective.\r\n\r\n    _Critical Period._--A period in the growth of a plant when it is\r\n    especially susceptible to the effects of atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\n    _Cumulo-nimbus_; _Cumulus_.--Forms of cloud. (See Chapter VI.)\r\n\r\n    _Cyclone._--An area of low barometric pressure with its attendant\r\n    system of winds. The cyclones of the region within the tropics\r\n    (_tropical cyclones_) are violent storms; those of higher latitudes\r\n    (_extra-tropical cyclones_) may be stormy or otherwise. Tropical\r\n    cyclones are also called _hurricanes_, _typhoons_ or _baguios_.\r\n    Extra-tropical cyclones are commonly known as _lows_ or _barometric\r\n    depressions_.\r\n\r\n    _Cyclonopathy._--The abnormal sensitiveness of certain persons to\r\n    the weather changes attending the passage of barometric depressions.\r\n\r\n    _Cyclonoscope._--A pasteboard dial formerly used in the West Indies\r\n    for locating cyclones.\r\n\r\n    _Dark Segment._--The shadow of the earth which, in clear weather,\r\n    rises from the eastern horizon at sunset and sinks below the\r\n    western horizon at sunrise.\r\n\r\n    _Deperditometer._--An instrument devised by A. Piche for measuring\r\n    the cooling power of the atmosphere, with reference to its\r\n    physiological effects.\r\n\r\n    _Depression._--A cyclonic area, or low.\r\n\r\n    _Desert Sounds._--(See _brontide_.)\r\n\r\n    _Devil._--The name applied to a dust whirlwind in India. The term\r\n    is also current in South Africa.\r\n\r\n    _Dew._--Atmospheric moisture condensed, in liquid form, upon\r\n    objects cooler than the air, especially at night.\r\n\r\n    _Dew-point._--The temperature at which, under ordinary conditions,\r\n    condensation of water vapor begins in a cooling mass of air. It\r\n    varies with the absolute humidity.\r\n\r\n    _Dew Pond._--The name applied in southern England to certain\r\n    artificial ponds on the uplands. They contain water in the driest\r\n    weather, and are popularly supposed to be fed by dew.\r\n\r\n    “_Doctor._”--A colloquial name for the sea breeze in tropical\r\n    climates. The name is sometimes applied to other cool, invigorating\r\n    breezes.\r\n\r\n    _Doldrums._--The equatorial belt of calms or light, variable winds,\r\n    lying between the two trade-wind belts.\r\n\r\n    _Drought._--A protracted period of dry weather. In the United\r\n    States a drought has been defined as a period of thirty or more\r\n    consecutive days during which precipitation to the amount of 0.25\r\n    inch does not occur in twenty-four hours. Other quantitative\r\n    definitions have been used in other countries.\r\n\r\n    _Dry Fog._--A haze due to the presence of dust or smoke in the air.\r\n\r\n    _Dust-counter._--An instrument for determining approximately the\r\n    number of dust particles or condensation nuclei per unit volume in\r\n    a sample of air.\r\n\r\n    _Dynamic Meteorology._--The branch of meteorology that treats\r\n    of the motions of the atmosphere and their relations to other\r\n    meteorological phenomena.\r\n\r\n    _Earth-air Current._--The electrical current that passes between\r\n    the earth and the air on account of their difference of potential.\r\n\r\n    _Eddy._--A more or less fully developed vortex in the atmosphere,\r\n    constituting a local irregularity in a wind. All winds near the\r\n    earth’s surface contain eddies, which at any given place, produce\r\n    “gusts” and “lulls.” Air containing numerous eddies is said to be\r\n    “turbulent.”\r\n\r\n    _Electric Niagara._--(See _hail rod_.)\r\n\r\n    _Evaporimeter._--(See _atmometer_.)\r\n\r\n    _Eye of the Storm._--A calm region at the center of a tropical\r\n    cyclone, or a break in the clouds marking its location.\r\n\r\n    _Fall Wind._--A wind blowing down a mountain-side; or any wind\r\n    having a strong downward component. Fall Winds include the foehn,\r\n    mistral, bora, etc.\r\n\r\n    _False Cirrus._--Cirruslike clouds at the summit of a thundercloud;\r\n    probably identical in structure with true cirrus, or cirro-stratus.\r\n    Sometimes more appropriately called “thunderstorm cirrus.”\r\n\r\n    _Fata Morgana._--A complex form of mirage, characterized by marked\r\n    distortion of images.\r\n\r\n    _Festoon Cloud._--Mammato-cumulus.\r\n\r\n    _Flashing Arcs._--Visible atmospheric sound waves, or explosion\r\n    waves.\r\n\r\n    _Flat._--Featureless; said of weather maps.\r\n\r\n    _Foehn._--A dry fall wind warm for the season, characteristic\r\n    of many mountainous regions. The air is cooled dynamically in\r\n    ascending the mountains, but this leads to condensation, which\r\n    checks the fall in temperature through the liberation of latent\r\n    heat. The wind deposits its moisture as rain or snow. In descending\r\n    the opposite slope it is strongly heated dynamically and arrives in\r\n    the valleys beyond as a warm and very dry wind. Some writers apply\r\n    this term to any wind that is dynamically heated by descent; e. g.,\r\n    the sinking air of an anticyclone.\r\n\r\n    _Foehn-sickness._--Headache, lassitude, depression, etc.,\r\n    attributed, in the Alpine valleys, to the blowing of the foehn.\r\n\r\n    _Foehn-wall_ (German: _Föhnmauer_).--A wall of cloud that forms\r\n    along the crest of a mountain ridge over which the foehn is blowing.\r\n\r\n    _Fog._--A cloud at or near the earth’s surface. A fog and a\r\n    cloud are identical in structure, though the former is due to\r\n    thermal conditions of the earth’s surface, while the latter is\r\n    most frequently clue to the dynamic cooling of ascending air. In\r\n    ordinary speech, the term “fog” generally implies an obscurity of\r\n    the atmosphere sufficiently great to interfere with navigation or\r\n    locomotion. (Cf. _dry fog_.)\r\n\r\n    _Fogbow._--A rainbow, colorless or nearly so, formed in a fog.\r\n\r\n    _Fog-drip._--Moisture that is deposited on terrestrial objects by\r\n    fog, and drips from them to the ground.\r\n\r\n    _Fracto-cumulus_; _Fracto-nimbus_; _Fracto-stratus_.--Forms of\r\n    cloud. (See Chapter VI.)\r\n\r\n    _Freeze._--1. Freezing of plants without deposit of hoarfrost.\r\n    2. Freezing temperatures prevailing generally over a region; not\r\n    exclusively nocturnal and not confined to the air close to the\r\n    earth’s surface. (Cf. _frost_.)\r\n\r\n    _Frost._--1. The act or state of freezing. In America, a “frost”\r\n    generally means the occurrence, near the beginning or end of\r\n    the growing season, of nocturnal temperatures low enough to be\r\n    injurious to vegetation; distinguished from a “freeze,” which is\r\n    more general and severe. The Weather Bureau classifies frosts,\r\n    according to their effects, as “light,” “heavy,” and “killing.” 2.\r\n    Atmospheric moisture condensed upon terrestrial objects in the form\r\n    of ice; sometimes frozen dew.

The gradients commonly discussed in meteorology are\r\n    the horizontal gradient of barometric pressure, the vertical\r\n    gradient of temperature, and the vertical gradient of electric\r\n    potential. British meteorologists now prefer the term _lapse-rate_\r\n    to _vertical gradient_.\r\n\r\n    _Graupel._--A kind of granular snow, sometimes called _soft hail_.\r\n\r\n    _Green Flash._--A bright green coloration of the upper edge of the\r\n    sun’s disk, sometimes seen when the rest of the disk is below the\r\n    horizon, at sunrise or sunset.\r\n\r\n    _Growing Season._--In agricultural meteorology, the interval\r\n    between the last killing frost in spring and the first killing\r\n    frost in autumn.\r\n\r\n    _Gust._--A sudden brief increase in the force of the wind.

Hail falls al-most exclusively\r\n    in connection with thunderstorms. For so-called “soft hail” see\r\n    _graupel_. (Cf. _sleet_.)\r\n\r\n    _Hail Rod._--A device analogous to a lightning rod, supposed to\r\n    have the property of averting the fall of hail. Hail rods have been\r\n    especially popular in France, where they are called _paragrêles_.\r\n    Large hail rods of recent construction are known as “electric\r\n    Niagaras.”\r\n\r\n    _Hail-shooting._--Bombarding the clouds to prevent the fall of hail.\r\n\r\n    _Halo._--A generic name for a large group of optical phenomena\r\n    caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere.

It has\r\n    sometimes been defined, in the United States, as a period of\r\n    three or more consecutive days during each of which the maximum\r\n    temperature is 90 degrees F. or over.\r\n\r\n    _Hot Wind._--A hot, parching wind characteristic of certain\r\n    continental interiors; especially Australia, northern India and the\r\n    prairie region of the United States.\r\n\r\n    _Humidity._--The degree to which the air is charged with water\r\n    vapor; viz., the actual amount of water vapor present (_absolute\r\n    humidity_, which may be expressed in terms of weight per unit\r\n    volume or as vapor pressure), or the ratio which this amount\r\n    bears to the maximum amount the air can contain at the prevailing\r\n    temperature (_relative humidity_, expressed in percentage).\r\n\r\n    _Hurricane._--A tropical cyclone; especially one of the West Indies\r\n    region. (A cyclone originating in this region and passing northward\r\n    into the temperate zone is still called a “West India hurricane,”\r\n    even after it has assumed the character of an extratropical\r\n    cyclone, and, if sufficiently severe, justifies the display of\r\n    “hurricane warnings” at ports of the United States. “Hurricane”\r\n    is also the designation of the highest wind force on the Beaufort\r\n    scale, and is thus applied to any wind exceeding about seventy-five\r\n    miles an hour.)\r\n\r\n    _Hygrograph._--A self-registering hygrometer.\r\n\r\n    _Hygrometer._--Any instrument for measuring the humidity of the air.\r\n\r\n    _Hygroscope._--A device that gives a rough indication of the\r\n    relative humidity of the air.

Called\r\n    _thermometer-screen_ in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    _Inversion._--More fully _temperature inversion_; an increase of\r\n    air temperature with increase of altitude, instead of the normal\r\n    decrease.\r\n\r\n    _Ion-counter._--An instrument for determining the number of ions\r\n    present, per unit volume, in a sample of air.\r\n\r\n    _Isobar._--A line of equal barometric pressure. (Isobars are\r\n    generally drawn on maps to show the horizontal distribution of\r\n    pressure reduced to sea level, or the pressure at some specified\r\n    altitude; but in a broader sense any line on a chart or diagram\r\n    drawn through places of equal pressure is an isobar.)\r\n\r\n    _Isohyet._--A line of equal rainfall.\r\n\r\n    _Isotherm._--A line of equal temperature.\r\n\r\n    _Isothermal Layer._--(See _stratosphere_.)\r\n\r\n    _January Thaw._--A period of mild weather popularly supposed to\r\n    recur each January, especially in New England.\r\n\r\n    _Katathermometer._--A device consisting of a dry-bulb and a\r\n    wet-bulb thermometer, designed for measuring the cooling power of\r\n    the atmosphere, with reference to its physiological effects.

The height of its\r\n    base, which varies with latitude and otherwise, averages between 6\r\n    and 7 miles. (Cf. _troposphere_.)\r\n\r\n    _Stray._--A natural electromagnetic wave in the ether. The term\r\n    is used in reference to the effects of such waves in producing\r\n    erratic signals in radiotelegraphic receivers.

In the United States generally called an\r\n    _instrument shelter_.\r\n\r\n    _Thunder._--The sound produced by a lightning discharge.\r\n\r\n    _Thunderstorm._--A storm attended by thunder and lightning.\r\n    Thunderstorms are local disturbances, often occurring as episodes\r\n    of cyclones, and, in common with squalls, are marked by abrupt\r\n    variations in pressure, temperature, and wind.\r\n\r\n    _Thunderstorm Recorder._--Any device that furnishes a record of\r\n    thunderstorms, either near or distant. Most thunderstorm recorders\r\n    register, by radiotelegraphy, the strays set up by lightning\r\n    discharges.\r\n\r\n    _Tornado._--1. A violent vortex in the atmosphere, usually attended\r\n    by a pendulous, more or less funnel-shaped cloud. 2.
