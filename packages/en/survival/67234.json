And, by the way, it was a boy who invented the\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nA small telescope, or a pair of field or opera glasses, will show you\r\nmany things in the sky which you cannot see with the naked eye, and if\r\nyou have one of these instruments, by all means use it. On the other\r\nhand, you can get along very well without a glass of any kind until you\r\nhave learned the things that are set down in this book.\r\n\r\nTo win a _merit badge_ in the organization of Boy Scouts, a boy must\r\npass certain tests; but it is just as necessary for you to know the\r\nstars as it is for a Boy Scout, and this book is so written that anyone\r\nwho studies it can pass the Boy Scout tests, and there are a few other\r\nthings in it which everyone should know.\r\n\r\nOnce that you have an insight into starcraft, you will never need to be\r\ntold again how very interesting and useful the stars are, and once that\r\nyou have mastered the chief points in this book, you should make or\r\nbuy a telescope having a two-or three-inch objective and get a little\r\ncloser to the stars.\r\n\r\nIf any questions should come up which you don’t understand, if you will\r\nwrite to me, I will write to you.\r\n\r\n    A.

That is, of course, we can easily find the points of the\r\ncompass if we have first learned how to find the North Star.\r\n\r\n=How to Make a Star Finder.=—To find the North Star for the first time\r\nis a very easy matter if the simple directions given below for making\r\nand using a star chart, or star finder, are followed.\r\n\r\nGet a smooth pine board, about 16 inches wide, 20 inches long and ⅞\r\ninch thick; make two cleats of wood, each of which is 1 inch wide, 12\r\ninches long and ½ inch thick, and screw these to the board near the\r\nends and on the same side, to prevent the board from warping, as shown\r\nin Fig. 1. If a drawing board of any size is at hand, it will serve the\r\npurpose just as well as a homemade board.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do is to obtain a sheet of cardboard about 12 by 16\r\ninches and cover one side of it with a dull black paint; when the paint\r\nis thoroughly dry lay it, black side up, on the smooth side of the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—STARBOARD SHOWING CLEATS.]\r\n\r\nFrom another sheet of white cardboard cut out seven stars, about the\r\nsize and shape shown in Fig. 2, and cut out another star nearly twice\r\nas large, to represent the North Star.\r\n\r\nNow place the white stars on the black surface of the cardboard in the\r\npositions shown in Fig. 3, using the smaller stars to form the outline\r\nof the _Big Dipper_ and the large star for the North Star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—CARDBOARD STAR.]\r\n\r\nWhen all of the stars have been properly arranged, fasten them to the\r\nblack cardboard with a bit of glue or mucilage. Push a thumb tack, or\r\na pin, through the center of the large star, which is the North Star,\r\nand well into the board, so that the chart, or star map, can be turned\r\nround on the board with the North Star as its _axis_. When this is done\r\nyour star finder is complete.\r\n\r\n=Finding the North Star.=—All being in readiness, take this chart, or\r\nstar finder, out-of-doors some evening when the _seeing_ is good and\r\nall the stars in the northern sky are shining brightly, and face about\r\nnorth, holding the starboard in front of you, as shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nUsually the direction of north is well known, and yet there are some\r\nplaces where the streets and roads do not run due north and south,\r\nand for this reason it is sometimes hard to tell exactly which way is\r\nnorth. In such a place either use a compass to get your bearing, or, if\r\nyou haven’t a compass, face about as nearly north as you know how.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—THE NORTH STAR AND BIG DIPPER ON STARBOARD.\r\n\r\n(Position of Big Dipper in Autumn.)]\r\n\r\nHaving looked at your star chart carefully raise your eyes from the\r\nboard until they are in a line with the northern _horizon_, that is,\r\nthe line where the earth and the sky seem to meet. Keep on raising\r\nyour eyes in a straight line until they reach a group of stars, which\r\nis about 40 degrees above the horizon. (See Fig. 98.) The line for\r\nsighting the North Star is shown in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nAll the stars of this group are very faint except one and this\r\nparticular star will stand out bright, distinct and alone, for the\r\nother two stars of the same group which can be plainly seen are not\r\nvery close to it. The star you have found is the _North Star_, or _Pole\r\nStar_, or to give it its proper name _Polaris_ (pronounced Po-la´-ris).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—FINDING THE NORTH STAR AND THE BIG DIPPER.]\r\n\r\nTo make sure you have not mistaken some other star for the North\r\nStar it will be a good idea to prove your find. Search around in the\r\nnorthern sky a little and you will see a group of seven bright stars\r\nfixed in the sky just as the cardboard stars are fixed on the black\r\nsurface of your chart, and which are shown in Figs. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n=The Big Dipper.=—This group of seven stars is called the Big Dipper\r\nbecause if a broken line joined all the stars together a very good\r\nfigure of a big dipper would be formed. A group of stars is called a\r\n_constellation_, and this constellation is shown as we see it in Fig.\r\n6, and as the ancient shepherds and sailors pictured it in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—LINE FOR SIGHTING THE NORTH STAR.]\r\n\r\nIn England this group of stars, or constellation, is sometimes called\r\nthe _Plough_, for our friends across the pond see in it the likeness\r\nof a plough as well as of a dipper. It is also called the _Great Bear_\r\nthe world over after the ancient name given it, but it requires some\r\nstretch of the imagination to liken it to that nubbly short-tailed\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nAll these fancy names were given this great group of stars long\r\nbefore the birth of Christ and by these names the constellation is\r\nstill familiarly called. Astronomers of the present time also call\r\nthis constellation the Great Bear, but they say it in Latin and so\r\nit becomes _Ursa Major_, which is a very high toned and scholastic\r\nsounding word. But the Big Dipper is a name that is good enough for all\r\nordinary purposes and so we’ll use it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—THE BIG DIPPER AS WE SEE IT.]\r\n\r\nThe stars forming the Big Dipper stand out so bright and clear in the\r\nnorthern sky that you won’t have the slightest trouble in finding it,\r\nespecially if you have the star finder at hand to help you.\r\n\r\nIn using the star finder there is one thing you should keep well in\r\nmind and that is that the Big Dipper as we see it turns round the North\r\nStar, like the hands of a clock, but in the opposite direction. That\r\nis, the Big Dipper, when below the North Star, _seems_ to turn round\r\nthe North Star from left to right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—THE GREAT BEAR AS THE ANCIENTS SAW IT.]\r\n\r\nIn a word the North Star forms one end of the axis round which not\r\nonly the Big Dipper but the whole starry heavens seem to revolve as\r\nthough they were fastened to the spokes of a great wheel. This is the\r\nway it seems to us. As a matter of fact, though, all the stars are\r\n_fixed_ in their positions in the sky, and the reason they seem to\r\nrevolve round the North Star is because the Earth from which we see the\r\nstars turns round instead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—THE EARTH, POLE STAR AND DOG STAR.]\r\n\r\nBy looking at the drawing shown in Fig. 8, it will be seen that the\r\n_north pole_ of our Earth is directly under the North Star,—hence the\r\nname Pole Star—and that if we could draw a line through the center of\r\nthe Earth from the _south pole_ to the _north pole_ and extend the line\r\nfar enough, or _produce_ it as it is called, it would finally meet the\r\nNorth Star.\r\n\r\nLet us take, now, another star, called the _Dog Star_—its real name\r\nis _Sirius_ (pronounced Sir´-i-us)—which is not far from a line with\r\nand overhead of the Earth’s equator; suppose we are some place on the\r\nearth where we can see both the North Star and the Dog Star at the same\r\ntime, and keeping in mind that the Earth is turning round on its axis;\r\nit must be plain, then, that though both of these stars are fixed in\r\nthe sky and never change their positions we on the Earth will turn away\r\nfrom the Dog Star until the Earth has turned half way round, but we\r\nwill not turn away from the North Star.\r\n\r\nThe eye, however, is easily deceived; for example, if we are on a\r\nmoving train nearby objects, such as houses, trees, etc., will seem to\r\nbe moving in the opposite direction to which we are going while we seem\r\nto be standing perfectly still. The illusion is much more complete when\r\nwe are seeing the stars, for the motion of the Earth as it spins on its\r\naxis and shoots round the Sun in its orbit is so steady that we cannot\r\nnotice it; for this reason it seems as if it is the stars which are\r\nmoving and that we are standing still.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand now why the Big Dipper, and all the other\r\nstars, seem to move in great circles round the North Star as well as\r\nwhy the Big Dipper marked with cardboard stars on your chart may not\r\nhave the same relative position to the horizon as the Big Dipper of\r\nreal stars in the northern sky, when you view them together as in Fig.\r\n4.\r\n\r\nNot only does the revolution of the Earth on its own axis once in every\r\n24 hours cause the Big Dipper to seem to turn round the North Star, but\r\nthe yearly journey of the Earth round the Sun makes a change in the\r\nposition of the Big Dipper as we see it at different seasons of the\r\nyear. And what has been said about the Big Dipper is just as true of\r\nall the other constellations.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons we would need an almanac to help us keep track of\r\nthe exact hour when the Big Dipper would be in a given position for\r\nevery night in the year. But you can always find the Big Dipper any\r\nevening in autumn about nine o’clock, by remembering that it is turned\r\nright side up as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Again, if you look for the Big\r\nDipper in winter at about nine o’clock in the evening you will find it\r\nstanding on its handle a little to the east as in Fig. 9. In spring\r\nabout 9 o’clock, it will have moved on round the North Star until it is\r\nupside down, as in Fig. 10, while in summer, at 9, it is hung up by its\r\nhandle high in the sky, as shown in Fig. 11. The four positions of the\r\nBig Dipper during the same hours of the different seasons are shown in\r\nFig. 12, which also shows the four positions of the Big Dipper during\r\neach 24 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—THE NORTH STAR AND BIG DIPPER IN WINTER.]\r\n\r\nBy turning the chart round on the board _counter-clockwise_ you will\r\nsoon come to a point where the Big Dipper of paper stars and the Big\r\nDipper of real stars are in exactly the same position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—THE NORTH STAR AND BIG DIPPER IN SPRING.]\r\n\r\nYou have, no doubt, noticed that a line joins the two end stars of the\r\nBig Dipper and the North Star in Figs. 3, 4, 10, and 11. These two end\r\nstars of the Big Dipper are called _pointer stars_, for they point\r\ndirectly to the North Star; that is if we draw a line with the eye\r\nthrough the pointer stars and produce, or continue the line, it will\r\nrun into the North Star, nearly.\r\n\r\nBy using these pointer stars it is easy for any one who knows the Big\r\nDipper to be able to find the North Star on any clear night in the\r\nyear, for the Big Dipper can be seen the year round.\r\n\r\nThe seven stars which form the Big Dipper are not the brightest stars\r\nin the sky by any means, yet each one is a great white sun as large or\r\nlarger than our own Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—THE NORTH STAR AND BIG DIPPER IN SUMMER.]\r\n\r\nNow look sharply at the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper,\r\nwhose name is _Mizar_ (pronounced Me´-zar), and see if you can make out\r\nanother little star whose name is _Alcor_ (pronounced Al´-cor) hugging\r\nup close to it. The Arabs who named them called these two stars the\r\n_Horse_ and its _Rider_. If you can see this little star Alcor you\r\nwill have cause to shake hands with yourself, for if your eyes are good\r\nyou can see it and if they are only fair to middling you cannot see it.\r\nThis is one of the famous Arab tests for eyesight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—TELLING TIME BY THE BIG DIPPER.]\r\n\r\n=How to Tell Time by the Big Dipper.=—We have seen how the Big Dipper\r\nseems to turn round the North Star and this being the case we can use\r\nthe pointer stars for the hour hand of a big star clock.\r\n\r\nYou must always bear in mind, though, that while the hands of a clock\r\nturn from right to left, the Big Dipper swings round from left to\r\nright; and there is another thing to be kept in mind and that is while\r\nthe hour hand of a clock goes _twice_ round in 24 hours, the Big Dipper\r\nrevolves only once in 24 hours, and for this reason the hand formed by\r\nthe pointer stars of the Big Dipper moves only half as fast as the hour\r\nhand of a watch or clock.\r\n\r\nEach quarter of the circle, then, is equal to 6 hours and by dividing\r\nthe quarter circles into 6 equal parts you can mark off the hours.\r\nThe best way to do this at first is to make a large drawing of Fig.\r\n12 on your starboard and compare it with the Big Dipper; then draw an\r\nimaginary circle round the North Star in the sky so that it will just\r\nclear the last star in the handle of the Big Dipper. With some practice\r\nyou will be able to tell the time within half an hour or less.\r\n\r\nIn telling the time by the Big Dipper you must remember that the stars\r\nin turning round the north pole run fast an hour every 15 days, and\r\nthis makes them gain 6 hours in 3 months and so they gain a complete\r\nrevolution in a year. But every time the Big Dipper makes one complete\r\nturn round the North Star, one complete day, as measured by star time,\r\nwill have passed.\r\n\r\nThe Pointers of the Big Dipper are in the four positions, shown in the\r\nfigure, on the following dates at 8 P.M.: May 1, 24th hour; Aug. 1, 6th\r\nhour; Nov. 1, 12th hour; Feb. 1, 18th hour. In the same way, on Sept.\r\n1 at 8 P.M. the pointers will be at 8 and they will also be there at 7\r\nP.M. on Sept. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHOW TO KNOW THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the tests a Boy Scout must pass in order to obtain his badge\r\nof merit for starcraft is to be able to name and point out twelve\r\nprincipal constellations, and every boy, whether he is a scout or not,\r\nshould be able to do the same thing for his own good.\r\n\r\nThe word _constellation_ is formed from two Latin words, the first\r\nbeing _con_ which means _together_, and the last being _stella_ which\r\nmeans _star_, or in plain English, constellation means _stars together_.\r\n\r\nIn your efforts to find the North Star you have already learned one of\r\nthe principal constellations—that of the Big Dipper—and to learn more\r\nof them will be even easier and much more fun, for now you have learned\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n=The Constellation of Cassiopeia.=—To find the constellation of\r\n_Cassiopeia_ (pronounced Cas´-i-o-pe´-ah) again make use of your star\r\nfinder. Remove all the stars from the blackened cardboard and rearrange\r\nthem so that the North Star is in the center of the board and the Big\r\nDipper is on the left hand side with the two pointer stars in a line\r\nwith the North Star. On this chart the Big Dipper must be made much\r\nsmaller than the one described in the first chapter.\r\n\r\nCut out five more stars from white cardboard and place them on the\r\nopposite side of the board from the Big Dipper in such a manner that\r\nthey will form the letter =W= being careful to fasten the stars to the\r\ncardboard so that the letter =W= stands in the exact position shown in\r\nFig. 13.\r\n\r\nA line drawn through the pointers of the Big Dipper and produced will,\r\nas before, pass through the North Star, and if it is extended an equal\r\ndistance beyond it, will pass very closely to the constellation of\r\nCassiopeia; this line will aid you in placing the stars on your chart\r\nin the right positions.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared the star finder, take it out into the open when\r\nnight comes on and begin by locating the North Star and the Big Dipper.\r\nNow set the Big Dipper and the North Star of your star chart in a\r\nposition which to your eye corresponds to the Big Dipper and the North\r\nStar in the sky. Follow the line from the pointer stars to the North\r\nStar and beyond when the great letter =W= which is the constellation of\r\nCassiopeia, will stand out so clear and bright that you will wonder why\r\nyou have never seen it before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—CONSTELLATION OF CASSIOPEIA.]\r\n\r\nFig. 14 shows this group of stars and the outline of the unhappy\r\nCassiopeia who is as often standing on her head as on her feet, but it\r\nrequires the imagination of an Arabian star-gazer to see the likeness.\r\n\r\n=The Little Dipper.=—Although some of the stars which form the _Little\r\nDipper_ are very faint it is included in our list of 12 principal\r\nconstellations for two reasons: first, because it contains the very\r\nimportant North Star, and second, because it is easy to find.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—CASSIOPEIA AS THE ARABS SAW HER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—THE LITTLE DIPPER OR LITTLE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nThe North Star is the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper. The\r\ntwo outer stars which form the bowl of the Little Dipper, and which are\r\ncalled the _Guardians of the Pole_, are quite bright, and after a few\r\ntrials you can easily put in the other stars that are much fainter, and\r\nso complete in your mind’s eye the outline of the Little Dipper as you\r\nhave it on your chart. Fig. 15 shows the arrangement of the stars in\r\nthe Little Dipper and the relative position of the Little Dipper to the\r\nBig Dipper.\r\n\r\nThe Little Dipper is also called the _Little Bear_ and this latter name\r\nwhen done into Latin becomes _Ursa Minor_, which is its scientific\r\nname. How the Little Dipper was made into a Little Bear by the ancients\r\nis shown in Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n=The Great Square of Pegasus.=—Unlike the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper\r\nand Cassiopeia, which are so close to the North Star that they never\r\nset and hence can be seen at any hour of the night and at any season of\r\nthe year, we now come to some constellations which are quite distant\r\nfrom the North Star and are for this reason to be seen only at certain\r\ntimes of the year. The _Great Square of Pegasus_ can always be seen on\r\nclear, crisp nights during the autumn months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—THE LITTLE DIPPER MADE INTO A LITTLE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nTo find a constellation that is as far away from the North Star as\r\nPegasus (pronounced Peg’-a-sus) is not an easy thing to do, at least\r\nthe first time you try it, for while our chart is marked with a\r\nstraight line the sky is like a great bowl and a line produced from the\r\nNorth Star to Pegasus will, in consequence, not be a straight line, but\r\na curved line. However, with your star finder charted like the diagram\r\nshown in Fig. 17 you will be able to locate Pegasus with very little\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nAfter taking off all the stars from the cardboard surface, pin or paste\r\nthe North Star to the lower left hand corner of the black surface of\r\nthe cardboard and place the five stars of Cassiopeia in their proper\r\npositions. Now draw a line from the North Star through Cassiopeia just\r\nbelow the star marked β which is the Greek letter _beta_ (see Appendix\r\nC) and produce, or extend that line until the edge of the cardboard\r\nis reached. On the extreme right hand end of this line set two stars,\r\nwhich we will also call pointer stars, and place two more stars above\r\nthem so that a nearly perfect square will be formed as shown in Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS.]\r\n\r\nTo find Pegasus take the star chart out-of-doors, say some evening in\r\nNovember about 9 o’clock, for the Great Square will then be on the\r\n_meridian_, that is, on a line passing over your head and which runs\r\nnorth and south across the sky. This time, instead of looking down on\r\nthe chart, as you did in finding the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia, turn\r\nthe board bottom side up, as shown in Fig. 18, but still keeping the\r\ncardboard North Star pointing north and the four stars of Pegasus\r\npointing toward the south.\r\n\r\nBy looking over your chart into the sky and following an imaginary line\r\nwith your eye from the North Star through Cassiopeia past the star β\r\n(beta) and lengthening this line toward the equator in the southern\r\nsky you will come upon four bright, white stars which form the Great\r\nSquare of Pegasus and you have added another and fourth constellation\r\nto your list.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of knowing the mighty constellation of Pegasus is\r\nthat you can always find the north, by means of its friendly stars,\r\nthough the North Star, the Big and Little Dippers and Cassiopeia are\r\nhidden by clouds. To find the north you only have to wait until Pegasus\r\ngets very high in the sky and run an imaginary line through the pointer\r\nstars of Pegasus and produce it until it reaches the northern horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—HOLDING THE CHART OF PEGASUS OVERHEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Square of Pegasus was fancifully pictured by the ancients as\r\na _Flying Horse_ and, curiously enough, with only half a body at that,\r\nas shown in Fig. 19. To those who do not know the lore of the stars it\r\nis not so easy to see in the Great Square the fabled winged steed who\r\nstill continues his flight through the sky just as he did when he was\r\ninvented over four thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—THE FLYING HORSE OF PEGASUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—FIGURE OF A TRAPEZIUM.]\r\n\r\n=The Mighty Orion.=—The brightest constellation in the whole sky is\r\n_Orion_ (pronounced O-ri´-on), the Great Hunter, as the ancients liked\r\nto imagine this group of stars.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Big Dipper, Orion is the easiest of all the\r\nconstellations to find provided you look for it at the right time of\r\nthe year, which is during the winter months.\r\n\r\nTo locate Orion cut out of cardboard seven large stars and three small\r\nstars. Near the lower edge of the blackened cardboard pin two large and\r\ntwo small stars to form what is called a _trapezium_, that is, four\r\nstraight lines forming a figure, none of which are parallel, as shown\r\nin Fig. 20. About halfway across the figure pin three large stars in a\r\nrow, at equal distances apart and tilted a little, as shown in Fig. 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—CONSTELLATION OF ORION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—ORION THE MIGHTY HUNTER.]\r\n\r\nThese three stars form the _Belt of Orion_, for a mighty hunter must\r\nneeds have a belt, and this belt of bright stars is one of the best\r\nknown groups in the whole sky. Across the belt and nearly at right\r\nangles to it pin three small stars; these small stars form the sword or\r\ndagger of the fanciful hunter but they are of more use to us than to\r\nhim, as will be seen presently.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the star chart pin the North Star so that it will be in\r\na direct line with the three small stars forming the _Sword of Orion_.\r\nYour star chart of Orion is now ready to be compared with the one in\r\nthe sky. The best time to find Orion is in January about 9 o’clock,\r\nwhen the constellation is high in the southern sky, though he may be\r\nseen shining in all his glory all winter long.\r\n\r\nOn taking your star chart out-of-doors hold it overhead just as you did\r\nin finding the Great Square of Pegasus; now look toward the south until\r\nyour eyes rest on the equator running across the southern sky from east\r\nto west and you will see the mighty Orion, though you may not recognize\r\nthe lion skin he holds.\r\n\r\nHaving found Orion draw an imaginary line through the three small\r\nstars called his sword and produce this line until it meets the North\r\nStar. Once you have found Orion you will never again require the help\r\nof a star chart to locate him, but it is a good plan to look him up as\r\noften as you can, and to draw the imaginary line through his sword and\r\non to the North Star, for should you ever lose your way or want to find\r\nthe north and the North Star should be hidden by clouds a line through\r\nthe Sword of Orion when Orion is in the south will direct you as\r\ncertainly as the needle of a compass. Fig. 22 shows the fabulous Orion\r\nas a giant hunter holding the skin of a lion which he killed, according\r\nto Arabian star-lore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—CONSTELLATION OF AURIGA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—AURIGA THE SHEPHERD.]\r\n\r\n=Auriga, the Charioteer or Shepherd.=—After finding Orion the\r\nconstellation of _Auriga_ (pronounced Aw-re´-ga) will get right in\r\nyour way so that you cannot by any chance miss it. This is because\r\nthe chief star in Auriga and whose name is _Capella_ (pronounced\r\nCa-pel´-la) lies nearly on the line drawn through the Sword of Orion\r\nand produced to the North Star as shown in Figs. 21, 23 and 27.\r\n\r\nAuriga was pictured by the Assyrians as a charioteer, but the early\r\nGreeks saw in this constellation a good shepherd, who carried a goat\r\non his back and two kids in his arms. The brilliant star Capella is\r\nsupposed to be the goat and the three small stars which form a triangle\r\nclose to Capella are the kids as shown in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nWhen the North Star cannot be seen the star Capella will prove a useful\r\naid with Orion in finding the north; and since it is just about half\r\nway between Orion and the North Star it may again be useful in judging\r\nthe distance of the North Star from Orion when the former star is\r\nobscured.\r\n\r\n=The Constellation of Taurus.=—The last constellation which need\r\nconcern us here is _Taurus_ (pronounced To´-rus) the Bull. Taurus\r\nis one of the constellations of the _zodiac_ of which we will have\r\nsomething to say in Chapter XI. By the time you have learned the\r\nforegoing constellations you will be able to locate Taurus without\r\nusing your star chart, for it lies to the north of Orion, to the south\r\nof Auriga and a little to the west of both of these constellations as\r\nyou will see in Figs. 25 and 27.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—CONSTELLATION OF TAURUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—TAURUS THE BULL.]\r\n\r\nThe little group of stars nearby is the _Pleiades_ (pronounced\r\nplē-ya-dez), and is a part of the constellation of Taurus. There are\r\nsix small but bright stars grouped closely together when seen by the\r\nordinary person, but if you have very sharp eyes you may be able to\r\nmake out one or two more.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the stars of Taurus were the first to be woven into\r\na group or constellation by the ancients, and it is thought that the\r\n_Bull of Light_, as Taurus was called, was known long before the time\r\nof Abraham, or over four thousand years ago. Fig. 26 shows Taurus as\r\nthe Egyptians saw him. The bright red star which sets in the right eye\r\nof Taurus is called _Aldebaran_ (pronounced Al-deb´-a-ran) and is one\r\nof the brightest stars in the sky. In the star chart shown in Fig. 27\r\nthe different constellations you have learned are grouped together in\r\nthe same positions in which they are placed in the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—STAR MAP SHOWING SIX CHIEF CONSTELLATIONS.]\r\n\r\nSix stars of the first magnitude, that is 6 of the 20 stars which\r\nshine the brightest (see Appendices F and G), are also shown on the\r\nchart, Fig. 27. By following the equator from west to east across\r\nthe bowl of the sky, and which runs right through the middle of\r\nOrion, you will find to the west and south of it the brightest star\r\nin the heavens—_Sirius_, the Dog Star, so named because it is in the\r\nconstellation of _Canis Major_, which is Latin for Big Dog.\r\n\r\nOf the other stars on the chart, Capella in Auriga is the next\r\nbrightest star, and _Arcturus_ (pronounced Arc-tu´-rus) which can\r\nbe found by following the handle of the Big Dipper, is third in\r\nbrilliancy. The fourth place is held by _Rigel_ (pronounced Rai´-gel)\r\nin Orion; _Betelgeux_ (pronounced Bet-el-gerz´) in Taurus is fifth in\r\norder, and _Aldebaran_ in Orion comes last.\r\n\r\nThere are many other constellations and a large number of other stars\r\nbut when you are able to name and point out those described in this\r\nchapter you will have made a very good running start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SUN, THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn naming over the stars of the first magnitude—that is, the stars that\r\nshine the brightest—there is one star I did not mention and yet as we\r\nsee it it is brighter than all the other stars put together.\r\n\r\nThis great star is our _Sun_ and since we owe everything we possess on\r\nEarth to him—light, heat, power and even life itself—he should and does\r\nstand in a class by himself, though after all he is just as much of a\r\nfixed star as the North Star, the Dog Star, or any of the thousands of\r\nother stars which we see as mere points of light in the sky.\r\n\r\n=How to See the Sun.=—You must never look directly at the Sun with the\r\nnaked eye, for he is so powerful that his light will injure your sight\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—SMOKING GLASSES OVER CANDLE FLAME.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—SEEING THE SUN THROUGH SMOKED GLASSES.]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways, though, to observe the Sun without danger to\r\nyour eyes and as all of these are simple and cost nothing you can\r\neasily try them. The most common way is to take a bit of window glass,\r\nsay an inch square, and smoke one side of it over the flame of a\r\ncandle, as shown in Fig. 28.\r\n\r\nWhen this blackened glass is held closely to the eye, as shown in Fig.\r\n29, and the latter is directed toward the Sun, a little circle of\r\nlight will appear on the film of smoke and the surface of the Sun may\r\nbe examined at length and without the least danger.\r\n\r\nA decided improvement over the smoked glass idea is to use a piece of\r\nred, or a piece of yellow glass, as an eyepiece, or, better, place the\r\nred and yellow glasses together and bind the edges with paper. Another\r\nplan to see the Sun without injury to the eyes is to make a hole with\r\nthe point of a needle in a visiting card and look through the hole\r\ndirectly at the Sun.\r\n\r\nA still better view of the Sun can be obtained if a pinhole telescope\r\nis used. A telescope of this kind can be easily made without tools,\r\nmetals or lenses. It is described and pictured in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nTo observe the Sun hold the pinhole end of the tube closely to your\r\neye, to cut off all the outside light, and sight the tube so that the\r\nSun shines directly into your eye through the pinhole, and you will get\r\na very brilliant view of the great yellow star which we call the Sun.\r\n\r\n=What the Sun is Made of.=—When a candle is lit the wax of which it is\r\nmade begins to melt and this is drawn up the wick where it is changed\r\ninto gas and the burning gas forms the flame.\r\n\r\nThe flame of a candle is made up of four parts, which are really layers\r\nof heated gas surrounding the wick, as shown in Fig. 30. In the center\r\nof the flame is the wick; the first layer of gas is at the bottom of\r\nthe flame and this gives a greenish-blue light; the second layer is\r\nthe dark and cool part of the flame; the third layer is a cone of\r\nheated gas which gives out the bright light, and surrounding this cone\r\nis a faint blue light which can just be seen.\r\n\r\nWe know, of course, what the candle is made of and we also know why\r\nit burns and in a way how it gives off light and heat because we have\r\nexamined it closely, but if we could get no nearer a candle flame than\r\na quarter of a mile it is very doubtful if we could ever be able to\r\nlearn anything about the real source of the flame—that is its greasy\r\nwick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—A CANDLE FLAME SHOWING LAYERS OF FLAME.]\r\n\r\nIt is much the same with the Sun, for we can only examine it at a great\r\ndistance and know it by its action on our senses, for the flaming\r\nlayers of the Sun are so bright that no one ever saw through them,\r\nso the real source of its light and heat—the core of the Sun—remains\r\nunknown. Fig. 31 shows the Sun as seen with a field glass.\r\n\r\nSince the Sun gives out light and heat it is easy to believe that it is\r\na great ball of very hot gases and from what astronomers have learned\r\nof him with their wonderful instruments this idea seems to be pretty\r\nwell founded.\r\n\r\nThe Sun must be a tremendously hot body—for the iron and other metals\r\nin it are not only melted but they boil away like water and are\r\nchanged into gases. Under certain conditions gigantic flames, called\r\n_prominences_, shown in Fig. 32, can be seen to leap from the edge, or\r\n_limb_, as it is called, of the Sun, and finally, great spots, called\r\n_sun spots_, are formed on the Sun that are so large a dozen worlds the\r\nsize of our Earth could be dropped into any one of them and rattled\r\naround like marbles in a cigar box. These are a few of the reasons we\r\nare led to believe that the Sun is a seething ball of fire.\r\n\r\n=The Sun’s Layers of Flame.=—Just as the wick of a candle is surrounded\r\nwith several kinds of flame, so the Sun has three layers of flame\r\naround a central core.\r\n\r\nThe core of the Sun is believed to be formed of liquid gases which are\r\nabout as thick as New Orleans molasses.\r\n\r\nAround this core, which is the real source of the Sun’s light and\r\nheat—and which has never been seen—is a dark layer of flame usually\r\ncalled the _Sun’s surface_; this layer, which is covered with numerous\r\ndark spots like freckles on the face of a red-headed boy, is called the\r\n_photosphere_, and it is this part of the Sun which gives out the most\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—THE SUN AS WE SEE IT.]\r\n\r\nThe second layer, which is called the _chromosphere_, is about 5,000\r\nmiles thick, and if you could imagine the whole world afire you would\r\nthen have but a faint idea of what a mighty seething sea of flame\r\nthis layer is. It is in this layer of luminous gases that terrific\r\nexplosions take place and red tongues of flame, or _prominences_, are\r\nshot out for upwards of 300,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAround the chromosphere is another layer of flame which extends for\r\nhundreds of thousands of miles in all directions. This last layer is\r\ncalled the _corona_, and it is as thin as the stuff of which dreams are\r\nmade. It is formed of the gas coronium and since it is so thin it can\r\nnever be seen except when there is a total eclipse, that is, when the\r\nMoon passes between us and the Sun, which will be explained in Chapter\r\nVII, and so shuts out the intense light of the other two layers. A\r\ncross section of the Sun is shown in Fig. 33.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—PROMINENCES OF THE SUN COMPARED WITH THE SIZE\r\nOF THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\n=Sun Spots and Their Effect on the Earth.=—Very often great spots are\r\nseen on the Sun’s surface. These purplish black spots appear to be\r\nholes, like the craters of volcanoes, in the photosphere, or layer of\r\nflame next to the core of the Sun. The sun spots are caused by great\r\neruptions which take place in the core of the Sun, and these sun\r\nspots are sometimes over 100,000 miles in diameter, when they can be\r\neasily seen with the naked eye; indeed if a sun spot has a diameter\r\nonly as large as that of our Earth, it can be seen with the naked eye,\r\nprotected, of course, with either a smoked or a colored glass, or\r\nbetter, with a pinhole telescope; in any case it will look like a black\r\nspeck about the size of a pinhead. Fig. 34 shows a view of a sun spot\r\nmade through a large telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—CROSS SECTION OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nWhenever the sun changes his spots _magnetic storms_ take place on the\r\nEarth, when compass needles, telegraph and telephone apparatus and\r\nwireless systems are disturbed. When a large number of spots appear at\r\nthe same time on the Sun the _Northern Lights_ are often very bright.\r\nSun spots have something to do with our weather, but the effects are\r\nnot yet well understood.\r\n\r\n=The Sun and the Weather.=—Of course the Sun has everything to do with\r\nthe weather, but to be able to predict the kind of weather we shall\r\nhave even the next day is a very hard thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the weather are caused by the heat of the Sun alone.\r\nThe heat of the Sun produces clouds by vaporizing the water of rivers,\r\nlakes and oceans. He causes hot and cold weather by heating some parts\r\nof the air more than other parts, and this sets the air in motion and\r\nwe call this movement of the air the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—SUN SPOT IN PHOTOSPHERE.]\r\n\r\nChanges of heat, moisture and wind are the cause of all the kinds of\r\nweather we have, and we have a good many kinds, be it hot or cold, dry\r\nor wet, calm or windy, clear or stormy, good, bad and indifferent.\r\n\r\n=To Forecast the Weather by a Barometer.=—The best way to tell what the\r\ncoming weather will be in the next few hours is by the rise and the\r\nfall of the _pressure_ of the air, or _barometric pressure_, as it is\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nA simple _barometer_ for showing the changes in the pressure of the air\r\ncan be made of a glass tube about 3 feet long, ½ inch in diameter, and\r\nclosed at one end as shown in Fig. 35. Fill the tube with mercury and,\r\nplacing your finger over the mouth of the tube, turn it upside down and\r\nput the open end into a cup, or other vessel, which is half full of\r\nmercury; in placing it into the cup be careful that no air gets into\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nOnly a small part of the mercury in the tube will run into the cup\r\nand this will leave a space in the top of the tube. Now fasten a\r\nyardstick, the purpose of which is to show the changes in the height of\r\nthe mercury in the tube, with a string or wire to the tube, and your\r\nbarometer will be complete, as shown in Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nSince the air presses on the mercury in the cup but not in the tube,\r\nthe pressure of the air on the mercury in the cup just balances the\r\nweight of the mercury in the tube and, hence, any increase or decrease\r\nin the pressure of the air, which ordinarily is about 15 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch, is shown by the rising or the falling of the mercury in\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nThe barometer in helping to forecast the weather shows that: (1) when\r\nthe mercury _rises_ in the tube, that is when it is high, the weather\r\nwill be _fair_; (2) when the mercury _falls_ in the tube, that is\r\nwhen it is low, _bad_ weather may be looked for; (3) when the mercury\r\n_suddenly falls_ in the tube a _storm_ is coming, and (4) when the\r\nmercury continues at a _high point_ the weather will remain _fair_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—BAROMETER TUBE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—BAROMETER COMPLETE.]\r\n\r\nTo remember these forecasts easily they may be briefly stated thus:\r\n\r\n(1) A _high_ barometer shows _fair_ weather.\r\n\r\n(2) A _low_ barometer shows _bad_ weather.\r\n\r\n(3) A _sudden fall_ of the barometer shows a _coming storm_.\r\n\r\n(4) A _constant high_ barometer shows continued _fair_ weather.\r\n\r\n=To Forecast the Weather by Signs.=—It will seldom happen that a boy\r\nwho goes camping, or one who otherwise wants to know what the weather\r\nis likely to be on the morrow, will have a barometer to consult, so the\r\nnext best thing is to know how to read the weather signs:\r\n\r\n    (1) “Red at night is the sailor’s delight” is an old\r\n        forecast, and means that the morrow will be a fine\r\n        day.\r\n\r\n    (2) “Red in the morning is the sailor’s warning,” which\r\n        means that rain is coming.\r\n\r\n    (3) A golden sunset is a sign that a high wind is\r\n        coming.\r\n\r\n    (4) A yellow sunset is a sign that rain is coming.\r\n\r\n    (5) When the Sun sets clear it is a sign of a fine day\r\n        on the morrow.\r\n\r\n    (6) When the Sun sets behind a cloud it is a sign that\r\n        the next day will be cloudy or rainy.\r\n\r\n    (7) A misty dawn shows the coming of a fine day.\r\n\r\n    (8) A low dawn, that is when the Sun shines clear on\r\n        rising, shows the coming of a fine day.\r\n\r\n    (9) A high dawn, that is when the Sun rises over a\r\n        haze, or clouds, shows wind.\r\n\r\n=To Light a Fire with the Heat of the Sun.=—A small _magnifying glass_,\r\nor burning glass, is simply a convex lens. It is a little piece of\r\napparatus that every boy should always carry with him just as he does\r\nhis pocket knife and compass. A lens 1½ inches in diameter and having a\r\n4-inch focus may be bought for 25 or 30 cents.\r\n\r\nA lens of this kind will be found very useful in many ways, for it\r\nwill greatly magnify any object such as cloth, leaves, insects,\r\nfinger-prints, in fact anything you may wish to see better than you\r\ncould with your naked eye, though you cannot use a single lens for a\r\nspyglass. A magnifying glass will also frequently come in handy for\r\nlighting fires, by using the Sun’s rays when matches are scarce.\r\n\r\nWhile a Boy Scout would disdain to use paper to kindle a fire, yet if\r\na scrap of paper is at hand it will prove a good medium on which to\r\ndirect the rays of the Sun with a burning glass. If you have no paper\r\nfocus your glass on some _punk_ or very dry leaves, as shown in Fig.\r\n37.\r\n\r\nTo focus the glass means to hold it away from the paper or leaves so\r\nthat the rays of the Sun are brought to a point like the sharpened end\r\nof a lead pencil; when all the rays of sunlight, each of which carries\r\na little heat, are brought to a point, they will make enough heat to\r\nlight a piece of paper or a dry leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—BOY FOCUSING BURNING GLASS ON LEAVES TO MAKE\r\nFIRE.]\r\n\r\n=Signaling with the Sun’s Rays.=—There are many ways of sending a\r\nsignal or a message across space by day, as, for instance, by means of\r\nsmoke, by flags and flashes of sunlight; by bonfires, pine-knot flames\r\nand burning arrows by night, and by wireless, which can be used either\r\nby day or by night.\r\n\r\nA simple and effective way to signal in the daytime when the Sun is\r\nshining is by using a mirror, that is, a looking-glass, as it is\r\ncommonly called. Every boy knows how to make flashes with a mirror, so\r\nit will be enough to say here that the glass is held in the hand in\r\nsuch a position that the sunlight falling upon it will be reflected in\r\nthe direction you wish to send the signals. Fig. 38 shows how it is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—BOY SENDING FLASH SIGNAL WITH MIRROR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—CONTINENTAL MORSE CODE.]\r\n\r\nAny sort of a code can be used, but it is far more interesting and will\r\nprove very useful if you are able to send and receive messages in the\r\ndot and dash alphabet, or Morse telegraph code, which is given in Fig.\r\n39. A short flash represents a dot, a long flash a dash and short and\r\nlong flashes represent letters. This is the same code that is used for\r\nwireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\n=How to Make a Simple Heliograph.=—A _heliograph_ is merely a mirror\r\nmounted on a baseboard, but this is a big improvement over holding the\r\nmirror in the hand, for to send and receive flashes over long distances\r\nthe mirror must be carefully aimed and kept in position.\r\n\r\nTo make a heliograph, get a board 12 inches long, 4 inches wide and\r\n1 inch thick and cut a piece out of one end 4 inches long and 1 inch\r\nwide, as shown in Fig. 40. Bore a ¼inch hole through the slotted end\r\nand another ¼ inch hole 4½ inches from the slotted end, as shown in the\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—BASE FOR HELIOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—BACK VIEW OF HELIOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nMake a block of wood 4 inches long, 1 inch wide and 1 inch thick and\r\nbore a ¼ inch hole through it near one end. To the other end of this\r\nstick fasten a mirror about 4 inches square. This mirror should be\r\nperfectly smooth—a plate glass mirror is the best—and have a hole\r\n¹/₁₆ inch in diameter drilled through the center of the mirror for\r\nsighting the heliograph, as shown in Fig. 41. Any optician will drill\r\nthe hole for you for a quarter or less. Fig. 42 shows a top view of the\r\nheliograph and Fig. 43 shows a side view of it.\r\n\r\nMake a wood frame so that the mirror can be fastened in it and screw\r\nthe frame to a stick of wood. Get a bolt 5 inches long and ¼ inch\r\nin diameter and have a thumb screw fitted to it. Set the end of the\r\nstick which has the mirror fastened to it into the slotted end of the\r\nbaseboard, push the bolt through the holes and after slipping on the\r\nwasher put on the thumb screw. The mirror can now be moved to and fro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—TOP VIEW OF HELIOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—SIDE VIEW OF HELIOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nInto the hole in the front part of the base put a wire or a thin round\r\nstick to sight the mirror by. The heliograph is now ready for use.\r\n\r\nAfter sighting the mirror at the place where the signals are to be\r\nreceived, set the mirror so that the reflected beam of sunlight shines\r\ndirectly on the place. To send signals in the Morse code all you need\r\nto do to make dots and dashes is to place a sheet of cardboard before\r\nthe mirror and take it away; the length of time the mirror remains\r\nuncovered determines whether it is a dot or a dash. The heliograph\r\ncomplete is shown in Fig. 44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—HELIOGRAPH COMPLETE.]\r\n\r\n=How to Make a Simple Sundial.=—To make a sundial of the usual kind\r\nthat will give the correct Sun time is not an easy matter, for the\r\nspaces marking the hours on the dial are not equal as they are on the\r\nface of the clock and this will make it hard to figure out.\r\n\r\nA kind of sundial that will give the correct Sun time though, can be\r\neasily made and at little cost. Get a strip of tin 2 inches wide and 24\r\ninches long; mark it off into 24 equal spaces like those on a two-foot\r\nrule, and beginning at one end with the number 1, number each space\r\nto 24, as shown in Fig. 45. This done, bend the strip of tin into a\r\nperfect ring with the numbers inside and solder the joint, as shown in\r\nFig. 46.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—NUMBERED STRIP FOR SUNDIAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—TIN RING FOR SUNDIAL.]\r\n\r\nNext get a strip of iron or brass ¼ inch wide, ¹/₁₆ inch thick and 13\r\ninches long; drill a ¹/₁₆ inch hole through each end and a ⅛ inch hole\r\n4 inches from one end; bend this strip into an exact semi-circle, as\r\nshown in Fig. 47 and solder the tin ring, at the point where numbers 1\r\nand 24 meet, to the middle of the brass semi-circle. Through the holes\r\nin the ends of the brass semi-circle fasten a wire, and this wire must\r\nrun exactly through the center of the tin ring. Now screw the brass\r\nsemi-circle to a baseboard (see Fig. 48), so that the angle made by the\r\nwire and the surface of the board will be equal to the latitude of the\r\nplace where it is to be used; in other words, when the board is level\r\nthe wire should point directly to the North Star and when this is done\r\nit will be adjusted to the proper angle. The board should be about 12\r\ninches square and 1 inch thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—BRASS SEMI-CIRCLE WITH SHADOW WIRE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—SUNDIAL COMPLETE.]\r\n\r\nSince the shadow of the wire made by the sunlight will fall on XII\r\nat noon, it will be plain that the shadow of the wire falling on the\r\nnumbers on one side or the other of the ring will mark the Sun time. To\r\nchange Sun time to _mean solar time_, or ordinary time, see _Equation\r\nof Time_, Appendix M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—TO FIND THE NORTH BY A WATCH.]\r\n\r\n=To Find the North by a Watch=.—To use a watch as a compass, that is to\r\nfind the north by means of a watch, is easy if the Sun is shining. The\r\nwatch should be held face upward; then turn the watch around until the\r\nhour hand points in the direction of the Sun. Draw an imaginary line\r\nfrom the hour XII to the center of your watch.\r\n\r\nIf, now, in the middle between this line and the hour hand you draw\r\nanother line from the center of the watch and produce, or extend it,\r\nthe middle line will point just about north, all of which is clearly\r\nshown in Fig. 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS, THE SUN’S KIDDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we said that all the stars in the sky, including\r\nour Sun, are fixed in their positions; by this we mean that if we\r\nwere to look at the Big Dipper every night for a hundred years we\r\ncould see no change in the positions of any of the stars forming this\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nBut if we look at the sky along the line of the _ecliptic_—that is the\r\npath of the Sun—one night after another we are likely to see a bright\r\npoint of light which looks exactly like a star and yet it is certain\r\nthat this point of light really does move among the other stars. What\r\nkind of a heavenly object then is this?\r\n\r\nThe bright point of light which thus seems to us to be a star when we\r\nlook at it with the naked eye is really another world, or _planet_ as\r\nit is called, and very like our own Earth. To prove that this moving\r\npoint of light is really a world, or planet, and not a distant star,\r\nall you need to do is to look at it through a pair of opera glasses, or\r\na small telescope, when it will be seen to be a round body, whereas a\r\nstar when viewed through the greatest telescope is never larger than a\r\nmere point of light. (See Fig. 50.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—A STAR AND A PLANET IN A TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe reason the planets, some of which are smaller and some larger than\r\nour Earth, can be seen to move is because they are quite near our\r\nEarth; that is, they are near when compared with the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reason the planets shine like the stars is not because\r\nthey are hot and flaming bodies like our Sun and the other stars, but\r\nbecause the light from the Sun which strikes them is reflected to the\r\nEarth in exactly the same way that the sunlight falling on a mirror is\r\nreflected away in another direction.\r\n\r\n=Names and Sizes of the Planets.=—The names of all the planets, and\r\nthere are eight chief ones, should be learned as well as the order in\r\nwhich they are arranged around the Sun. The names of the planets are\r\ngiven below in the order of their _size_.\r\n\r\nMERCURY—The smallest planet and the one nearest the Sun. Pale ash in\r\ncolor. Has no moon.\r\n\r\nMARS—The Red Planet. Reddish in color. Has two moons.\r\n\r\nVENUS—Called the Evening Star. Brilliant straw in color. Has no moon.\r\n\r\nEARTH—Our own planet. Has one moon.\r\n\r\nURANUS (pronounced Yew´-ra-nus)—Called Herschel’s planet. Pale green in\r\ncolor. Has five moons.\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE—The planet farthest away from the Sun. Has one moon.\r\n\r\nSATURN—The planet with the rings. Its color is a dull yellow. Has ten\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\nJUPITER—The largest planet. He is marked with lines called belts. He\r\nhas nine moons. Bright silver in color.\r\n\r\nTHE ASTEROIDS—A group of small planets, the largest of which is about\r\n500 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\n=How to Know the Planets.=—While it is not an easy thing to tell a\r\nplanet from a star with the naked eye, still there are several ways of\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nFirst, always look for the planets along the path which the Sun and\r\nMoon travel. As all the planets are nearly in the same plane with the\r\nSun and Moon they must all follow the same path across the sky.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is useful to remember that none of the planets, except\r\nMercury, ever twinkle, unless they are very near the horizon.\r\n\r\nThird, by watching a planet closely for a few hours it will be found\r\nto have moved a little. To note this change of position the planet and\r\nsome fixed star near it must be closely watched and their distances\r\ncompared from time to time.\r\n\r\nFourth, and last, the surest way of finding the different planets is\r\nby using an almanac which will tell you which planets can be seen at\r\ncertain times of the year and in what part of the sky they are to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—SIZES OF PLANETS COMPARED.]\r\n\r\n=Seeing Mercury.=—_Mercury_ is so near the Sun that it can only be seen\r\nwith the naked eye at certain times. Mercury should be looked for just\r\nabove the eastern horizon for about an hour before the Sun rises in the\r\nspring; and above the western horizon for about an hour after the Sun\r\nsets in the autumn. You will have no trouble in knowing Mercury if you\r\ncan only see him, for he is very bright and will be near the horizon.\r\nHis pale ash color will also help you to single him out from the stars\r\nabout him. Mercury goes through _phases_ like our Moon, but these\r\ncannot be seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nMercury is a curious planet in that his day and his year are of exactly\r\nthe same length, just like our Moon; this means that he turns on his\r\naxis once in exactly the same length of time it takes him to travel\r\nround the Sun. This causes one side of Mercury to be always turned\r\ntoward the Sun, and of course this side is hot and light, while the\r\nother side is always turned away from the Sun and, consequently, it\r\nis dark and cold. Three views of Mercury in different phases as seen\r\nthrough a telescope are shown in Fig. 52.\r\n\r\nMercury is 36 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is 88 of our days long.\r\n\r\nHis year is 88 of our days long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—THREE VIEWS OF MERCURY.]\r\n\r\n=Seeing Mars.=—We hear more of _Mars_ than of any other planet for two\r\nreasons: first, because great lines can be seen on his surface which\r\nare thought to be canals, and second, since Mars sometimes comes almost\r\nas close to the earth as Venus, there has been a great deal of talk\r\nsince the invention of wireless telegraphy about our signaling to him.\r\n\r\nThat people could live on Mars is possible, for the Red Planet is like\r\nour Earth, in that it has land, water and air, weather and seasons,\r\nwith a warm equator and ice-covered poles. Seen through a telescope he\r\nlooks like Fig. 53, though much smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—MARS AS SEEN THROUGH A TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nBut Mars cannot always be seen, for sometimes he disappears for a\r\ncouple of years, but when he finally does return he is a good planet,\r\nfor he stays a long time, and you cannot mistake him, for he will shine\r\nruddy and bright with never a merry twinkle.\r\n\r\nMars is 141 millions of miles from the sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 4,200 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is 24½ of our hours long.\r\n\r\nHis year is 687 of our days long.\r\n\r\n=Seeing Venus.=—_Venus_ is so much brighter than any of the other stars\r\nor planets that you will know her the instant you see her. Indeed, when\r\nVenus is the brightest and the Sun is far enough away from her, she can\r\noften be seen with the naked eye in the daytime if the sky is clear.\r\nThree views of the phases of Venus are shown in Fig. 54.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—THREE VIEWS OF VENUS.]\r\n\r\nTo see Venus you must look for her early in the morning in the east\r\nbefore the Sun is up, or in the evening in the west just after the Sun\r\nhas gone down. This is the reason Venus is sometimes called an _evening\r\nstar_ and sometimes a _morning star_. Venus goes through phases like\r\nMercury and our Moon, but these cannot be seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nWhen Venus and the Sun get too close together she cannot be seen, for\r\nthe light of the Sun is so powerful that her reflected light is dimmed\r\nby it. Venus is a bright straw color and she is a beautiful object in\r\nthe sky when visible, but there are weeks at a time when she cannot be\r\nseen, by reason of the Sun outshining her when she is between us and\r\nthe Sun or on the other side of the Sun. The day and the year of Venus\r\nare, like Mercury, probably equal, and hence one side of Venus is\r\nalways turned toward the Sun and basks in its light and heat, while the\r\nother side is turned away from the Sun and is doomed forever to cold\r\nand darkness.\r\n\r\nVenus is 67 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHer diameter is 7,700 miles.\r\n\r\nHer day is 225 of our days long.\r\n\r\nHer year is 225 of our days long.\r\n\r\n=Our Earth.=—The _Earth_ is the third planet in distance from our Sun,\r\nand although it is small compared with some of the others it is so\r\nimportant to us that it will be described in a separate chapter. Fig.\r\n55 shows a view of the Earth as she would be seen from the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—JUPITER.]\r\n\r\nThe Earth is 93 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHer diameter is 7,920 miles.\r\n\r\nHer day is 24 hours long.\r\n\r\nHer year is 365 days long.\r\n\r\n=Seeing Jupiter.=—_Jupiter_, the largest planet which revolves round\r\nour Sun, is fifth in distance from him. He is not as bright as Venus,\r\nbut he is brighter than any of the fixed stars, and by his brightness\r\nand silvery color he is quite easy to recognize.\r\n\r\nThis great planet seems not to have cooled down yet into a nice world\r\nlike our own Earth or someone’s else Mars, but rather he is a ball\r\nsurrounded by clouds of hot vapor. Still he is not hot enough to give\r\nout any light himself, but like the rest of the planets he shines by\r\nthe reflected light of the Sun. Fig. 56 is a view of Jupiter as seen\r\nthrough a telescope; one of the moons, and its shadow on the planet, is\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nJupiter is crossed with several bands and he has nine moons to light up\r\nhis great surface on a dark night, but neither his belts nor his moons\r\ncan be seen without a glass.\r\n\r\nJupiter is 483 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 87,000 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is about 10 of our hours long.\r\n\r\nHis year is almost 12 of our years long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—SATURN.]\r\n\r\n=Seeing Saturn.=—It is not quite as easy to single out _Saturn_ with\r\nthe naked eye, for his light is just about as bright as Capella in the\r\nconstellation of Auriga, or any of the other first magnitude stars.\r\n\r\nThis disadvantage is offset by the fact that when he rises at sunset\r\nhe can be seen during the whole night, so that you will not only have\r\nplenty of time in which to find him, but to observe him as well. Again,\r\nSaturn may be seen any clear night during the winter months until the\r\nyear 1920.\r\n\r\nLike the Earth, Saturn is believed to have a more or less solid core,\r\nbut hotter and with layers of gas around him. It is the sixth planet\r\nfrom the Sun, and with his beautiful rings, which are formed of\r\nmillions of little pieces—each a moon in itself—and with his ten large\r\nmoons, when seen through a telescope he is far and away the mightiest\r\nsight in the whole sky at night. He and his wonderful rings are shown\r\nin Fig. 57.\r\n\r\nSaturn is 886 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 73,000 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is 10 of our hours long.\r\n\r\nHis year is 29 of our years long.\r\n\r\n=Seeing Uranus.=—If you have sharp eyes and will look for _Uranus_ in\r\nthe spring and summer months, you should be able to see him. He has a\r\npale green color, and on a clear moonless night is visible to a good\r\neye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—URANUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—NEPTUNE.]\r\n\r\nUranus is the planet star from the Sun and before Herschel discovered\r\nhim with his homemade telescope astronomers frequently mistook him\r\nfor a fixed star. As seen through a large telescope Uranus shows some\r\nindistinct markings.\r\n\r\nUranus is 1,780 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 32,000 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is thought to be 11 hours long.\r\n\r\nHis year is 84 of our years long.\r\n\r\n=Neptune.=—_Neptune_ is so far away from the Sun he cannot be seen with\r\nthe naked eye, but he can be easily seen with a good opera glass. He is\r\nattended by one moon. He is simply a disk of light when seen through a\r\nbig telescope, as shown in Fig. 59.\r\n\r\nNeptune is 2,790 millions of miles from the Sun.\r\n\r\nHis diameter is 36,000 miles.\r\n\r\nHis day is unknown.\r\n\r\nHis year is 165 of our years long.\r\n\r\n=The Asteroids.=—The _Asteroids_ are a group of small planets moving\r\naround the Sun in orbits between the Earth and Mars and, hence, at\r\ntimes these little bodies come very close to us. The group occupies a\r\nplace in the sky where we should expect to find a single large planet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—MARBLES ON TOP OF TABLE.]\r\n\r\nBut when the planets were made, Jupiter, with his great bulk pulled the\r\nsoft pieces apart of which a planet would have been formed, and instead\r\nof one planet of respectable size there are hundreds of little planets\r\nranging anywhere from 10 miles to 500 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nOne of these small planets is called _Vesta_, and although she is only\r\n240 miles in diameter she may be seen on certain occasions with the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\n=Positions of the Planets Round the Sun.=—It was mentioned in the\r\nbeginning of this chapter that all of the planets lay not far from one\r\n_plane_, and that the Sun’s equator is nearly in this plane. Now let us\r\nsee just what this means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—TOP VIEW OF SOLAR SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nSuppose we lay eight marbles around a large marble placed on top of a\r\ntable and in the center. This means that all the marbles lie in the\r\nsame plane which is the top of the table, as shown in Fig. 60. The\r\nplanets are all arranged round the Sun, as shown in Fig. 61, just the\r\nsame as if they were all placed on a big, level board or table top. If\r\nwe draw a picture of the plane view of the planets (Fig. 60) and the\r\ntop view of the planets (Fig. 61) together, we shall have a picture of\r\nthe _solar system_, as the Sun and all of his planets are called, as\r\nshown in Fig 62. From these pictures you will see that the planets are\r\nnot arranged, in distance from the Sun, in order of size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—SOLAR SYSTEM IN PERSPECTIVE.]\r\n\r\nTo remember the arrangement of these planets in their relation to the\r\nSun commit to memory this simple sentence:\r\n\r\n_Men Very Early Made Jars Serve Useful Needs._\r\n\r\nAs the first letter of each of the above words is the same as the first\r\nletter of a planet, you will be able to instantly recall the proper\r\nplace of any one of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—EGG SHELL ON PLATE.]\r\n\r\n=How the Planets Are Held in Space.=—If you will take an ordinary\r\ndinner plate and half an eggshell, and give the eggshell a slight spin\r\non the rim of the plate—the rim should be slightly moistened—you will\r\nfind that by tilting the plate a trifle the eggshell will revolve in\r\ntwo directions; first, it will spin round on its own axis, and second,\r\nit will travel round the rim of the plate, which we will call its\r\norbit, as shown in Fig. 63.\r\n\r\nThis double motion of the eggshell is exactly like the double motion\r\nof a planet—each one turns on his own axis and each travels round the\r\nSun in its own orbit; moreover, all the planets travel round the Sun\r\nin the same direction, the nearest planets taking the shortest time\r\nto complete the circle or orbit, while those farthest away take the\r\nlongest time to go round their orbits just as we might expect them to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of things the planets were a part of the Sun, as we\r\nshall see further on, and when they were thrown off by him they spun\r\nround their own axes, and they continued to spin round their axes just\r\nas a ball continues to do so after it has left the pitcher’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to fly off at a tangent which every particle of a rotating\r\nbody feels is called centrifugal force. Now, no one knows what\r\ncentrifugal force is, but how it acts is very well known, and you can\r\nfind out for yourself by making the following experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—BOY THROWING STONE TO ILLUSTRATE CENTRIFUGAL\r\nFORCE.]\r\n\r\nTake a stone and tie one end of a string to it; now swing the stone\r\nround in a circle; if the string should break, or you should let it go\r\naccidentally (on purpose) the stone will shoot off at a _tangent_, that\r\nis in a line away from the circle in which it was swinging, as shown in\r\nFig. 64.\r\n\r\nThis is just what made the planets, one after another, separate from\r\nthe Sun, but they could not get very far away, for another force which\r\nis not only in the Sun but in every particle of matter in the universe,\r\npulled them back toward the Sun, just as it pulls a ball when thrown to\r\nthe Earth, and this force is called _gravitation_.\r\n\r\nSo the centrifugal force keeps them spinning round on their axes and\r\nflying round in their orbits about the Sun. If it had not been for the\r\nattractive force of gravitation of the Sun and the planets, the planets\r\nwould have kept right on going out into space and left the Sun to shift\r\nfor itself forever after.\r\n\r\nAs it is they whirl round the Sun, never able to get any farther from\r\nhim and yet never getting any nearer to him, for the centrifugal force\r\ntends to make them fly out and away and the force of gravitation tends\r\nto pull them back to the Sun. The result is that these two great\r\nopposing forces exactly offset or balance each other, and the planets\r\nare held in their orbits just as securely as the stone is held out by\r\nthe force the boy exerts to move it, and in by the string he holds in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThis balancing of opposed forces was nicely shown some years ago by Sir\r\nRobert Ball, the great English astronomer, at one of his lectures in\r\nthe Royal Institution of London, and I reproduce it here.\r\n\r\nTo the ceiling over his lecture table he had fastened a thin wire, the\r\nlower end of which was secured to a hollow iron ball. When the ball\r\nwas pulled aside, it would swing like a great pendulum, forth and\r\nback, in a plane, as shown in Fig. 65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—IRON BALL PENDULUM SWINGING IN STRAIGHT LINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—IRON BALL PENDULUM SWINGING IN CURVED LINE.]\r\n\r\nBut when a powerful magnet was placed on the table and the ball was\r\nset swinging in a plane as before, just as it came close to the end of\r\nthe magnet the latter pulled the ball with its mighty force toward it,\r\nand so changed its course, but the ball, instead of being attracted\r\ndirectly to it, swung in a graceful curve around it, as shown in Fig.\r\n66.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the case of the planets swinging round the Sun, and\r\nshows very nicely the balanced forces of the Sun and the planets and\r\nwhy the planets stick to their orbits.\r\n\r\n=Why the Planets Do Not Stop Spinning.=—Now you may ask why the planets\r\ndo not stop turning on their axes and revolving in their orbits round\r\nthe Sun. And the answer is because there is nothing to stop them.\r\n\r\nIf you spin a top on a plate it may keep going for a long time, but it\r\nwill finally die down and stop. This is because there are other forces\r\nwhich oppose its centrifugal force. The forces a spinning top has to\r\novercome are _friction_ between the point of its spindle and the plate,\r\nand the _resistance_ between the surface of the spinning top and the\r\nair pressing on its sides, and the friction and the air resistance\r\ntogether soon use up the energy stored in the top and which makes it\r\nspin.\r\n\r\nBut if you could spin and throw a top far enough away from the Earth\r\nso that it would not meet with friction or resistance of any kind, it\r\nwould go on spinning forever just like the planets.\r\n\r\n=How to Plot the Position of a Planet.=—One of the tests which a Boy\r\nScout must pass in order to obtain a merit badge for starcraft is to\r\n“plot on at least two nights per month for six months the positions\r\nof all naked eye planets between sundown and one hour thereafter. The\r\nplot of each planet shall contain at least three fixed stars with their\r\nnames and designations, colors of planets and stars to be recorded by\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nNow, by looking at your almanac under the head of Morning and Evening\r\nStars you will find all the planets which are listed as Evening Stars,\r\ntogether with the dates when they can best be seen. From your almanac\r\nfor 1915 you will learn that\r\n\r\n    _Mercury_ is an evening star, and can be seen\r\n      about Feb. 5, May 31 and September 27 in the west,\r\n      just after sunset; that\r\n\r\n    _Venus_ will be an evening star from September\r\n      12 for the rest of the year; that\r\n\r\n    _Jupiter_ will be an evening star until February\r\n      24; after that a morning star until September 17, and\r\n      then an evening star for the rest of the year, and\r\n      that\r\n\r\n    _Saturn_ will be an evening star until June 28.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to find what constellation is on your\r\n_meridian_ at 9 P. M. for the month that the planet you wish to plot is\r\nto be seen. This you can do by looking at the map of the stars shown\r\nin Fig. 67. You can see any of the stars or constellations on your\r\nmeridian by looking for them at 9 o’clock P. M. on the months marked\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nThis done, consult your almanac and find out what time the Sun sets on\r\nthe day that the planet you are looking for can be seen.\r\n\r\nAs an example let’s take Mercury, which the almanac says is an evening\r\nstar about February 5, and which can be seen in the west just after\r\nsunset. The almanac will also tell you that the Sun sets on February 5\r\nat 5 o’clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—MAP OF STARS ON SUN’S PATH.]\r\n\r\nThe star map (Fig. 67) will show you that the constellation of\r\n_Gemini_, the Twins, is one which can be seen in February on your\r\nmeridian at 9 o’clock at night, and you know that Mercury can be seen\r\nclose to the western horizon from 3 to 4 hours earlier.\r\n\r\nSince Gemini, the Twins, is on the meridian at 9 o’clock, _Taurus_, the\r\nBull, which is the next constellation to it, will be on the meridian at\r\n7 o’clock, and _Aries_, the Ram, will be on the meridian at 5 o’clock.\r\n\r\nNow the next constellation to the west of Aries, the Ram, is _Pisces_,\r\nthe Fishes, and the next one to Pisces, the Fishes, is _Aquarius_, the\r\nWater Bearer, and as this constellation sets about an hour after the\r\nSun, it is in this constellation that you will find Mercury in the\r\nearly February evenings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—DIAGRAM OF POSITION OF CONSTELLATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram (Fig. 68) shows how it is that when Aries is on the\r\nmeridian at 5 o’clock in the evenings of February, Gemini will be\r\nrising in the east, and Aquarius, with Mercury in it, will be getting\r\nready to set in the west.\r\n\r\nYou can find all the other planets in the same way, but it is much\r\neasier to find them in the sky than it is to try and imagine their\r\npositions after reading how it is done. You should, though, by all\r\nmeans, read the chapter on _The Stars of the Zodiac_ before you try to\r\nplot a planet, for there is much useful information in it which you\r\nought to know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNO.

This will leave a margin of 1 inch on\r\nboth sides, ½ inch on top and 1¼ inches at the bottom of your paper.\r\n\r\nFasten the paper to your starboard, described in Chapter II, and go\r\nforth with it and your acetylene or flash lamp and find your planet.\r\nHaving found it, mark with a pencil in the squares on your ruled paper\r\nthe positions of three of the nearest fixed stars which are shown in\r\nthe star chart of Fig. 67. Now mark the position of the planet as\r\nyou see it on your chart by making a little circle and your outdoor\r\nobservation is ended.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, mark down the chart number, the date and the time you made\r\nthe observation; also the names and colors of the stars and the planet,\r\nand finish the record by signing your name. Should any of the other\r\nplanets be visible at the time of your observation you will, of course,\r\nhave to plot two charts, unless the planets are very near each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMOTHER EARTH, OLD ADAM’S PLANET\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Earth in the Making.=—The Earth on which we live and find so\r\nmuch that is interesting was once a part of our Sun just as the other\r\nplanets were.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun was being made of star stuff great quantities of gases\r\nwere set into mighty whirls, and when these acquired enough force they\r\nshot off into space like so many cannon balls, and they are still\r\na-whirling.\r\n\r\nBut these new-born planets could only get a certain distance away from\r\nthe Sun, as we have learned, for the force of his attraction offset the\r\nforce of their motion with the result that they are still held in space\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nOne of these whirling bodies was the Earth, and when it had comfortably\r\nsettled in its orbit and slowed down a bit it began to cool off and\r\na crust was formed on its liquid surface, just as ice is formed when\r\nwater is frozen. Then some of the gases condensed into water and others\r\nbecame air and when the Earth had cooled down still further some\r\nmillions of years afterward it became a more or less suitable place for\r\nhuman beings to live on.\r\n\r\nWhile the Earth has cooled off until it is possible for us to live\r\ncomfortably on its crust, it is still warm outside and very hot inside.\r\nThis is proved by volcanoes which throw out white hot lava and gases\r\nwhen they are in eruption.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the light and heat of the Sun in the past ages\r\nthere never could have been any kind of life on the Earth. The Earth\r\nis just as dependent on the Sun now as it was in the past, and if he\r\nshould fail to shine on our world for even a little time everything\r\nwould die. Fig. 70 is a cross section of the Earth.\r\n\r\n=To Prove the Earth is Round.=—Every boy knows that the Earth is round,\r\nbut the wisest of men did not know it for certain until about 400 years\r\nago, when one of Magellan’s ships made a complete voyage round the\r\nworld and returned to the place she started from.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—CROSS SECTION OF THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\n(1) One of the easy ways to show that the earth is round, or at least\r\nthat the surface of the earth is curved, as shown in Fig. 71, is to\r\nwatch a ship as she sails out to sea. All of the ship—hull, sails\r\nand smokestack, if she has one—can be seen until she sails over the\r\nhorizon, and then her hull, which is the largest part of her, is lost\r\nto view, then her sails and stack, and finally only the tops of her\r\nmasts can be seen. It is a pretty good sign that the Earth is a ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—SAILS OF SHIP CAN BE SEEN AFTER HULL HAS\r\nDISAPPEARED.]\r\n\r\n(2) A very pleasant way to prove the Earth is a ball is to take passage\r\non a ship that makes a round-the-world cruise. If you leave New York\r\nand keep sailing east all the time you will finally land at San\r\nFrancisco; keep on going east by rail and you will find yourself back\r\nin dear old New York, where you started from. See Fig. 72.\r\n\r\n=To Prove the Earth Turns on Its Axis.=—(1) Having proved that the\r\nEarth is round, the next thing to do is to prove that it turns about on\r\nits axis.\r\n\r\n(1) The best known experiment for showing that the Earth really turns\r\non its axis was made by Foucault (pronounced Foo-ko´), a French\r\nphilosopher, in 1851, who used a pendulum for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—SAILING ROUND THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\nIn the top of a great dome in a building in Paris, called the\r\n_Panthéon_, Foucault hung a large metal ball by means of a wire about\r\n150 feet long. On the floor he made a mark, exactly under the ball,\r\nrunning due north and south. Then drawing back the ball, he let it go,\r\nwhen it swung directly over the line.\r\n\r\nThe heavy pendulum, which after being started swung for hours, seemed\r\nto move away from the line in the direction of the hands of a watch.\r\nThis showed that the floor of the Panthéon was really skewing around\r\nunder the swinging pendulum. This is easily explained as due to the\r\nrotation of the earth because the northern edge of the floor was nearer\r\nthe axis of the earth than the southern edge and therefore was carried\r\nmore slowly eastward.\r\n\r\n(2) A much simpler way to show the turning of the Earth on its axis,\r\nthough this experiment only proves that either the Earth or the whole\r\nsky turns, is to make a photograph of the North Star and the stars in\r\nits neighborhood, as explained in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the sensitive plate is being exposed the camera will be\r\ncarried round by the Earth turning on its axis and the fixed stars will\r\nleave bright trails on the plate in _arcs of circles_.\r\n\r\n=The Earth Turning on Its Axis Makes Day and Night.=—The Earth, in\r\nturning round on its axis once every 24 hours, receives the light of\r\nthe Sun on half of its surface at a time, making the day, while the\r\nother half is in the shadow, which makes the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—THE EARTH MOVES AWAY FROM THE SWINGING\r\nPENDULUM.]\r\n\r\nIf the equator of the earth was in a plane with the Sun, as shown in\r\nPig. 74, it is easy to see that the days and nights all over the world\r\nwould be of the same length, that is, each would be 12 hours long.\r\nInstead, the Earth is tilted a little, as shown in Fig. 75—to be exact,\r\nits axis is tilted 23½ degrees out of the _perpendicular_ and this\r\nmakes the day and the night at the equator each 12 hours long and the\r\nday and the night at the north and south poles each six months long.\r\n\r\nThe circle round the Sky which is in a plane with the Sun is called\r\nthe _ecliptic_. The Sun seems to follow a path round the Earth in this\r\nplane, and this is called the _path of the Sun_.\r\n\r\n=To Show That the Earth Travels Round the Sun.=—When we look at the Sun\r\nand the stars it is hard to believe that they are standing still and\r\nthat it is the Earth which is whirling round on its own axis and also\r\nround the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—IF THE EARTH’S EQUATOR WERE IN A LINE WITH THE\r\nSUN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—THE EARTH TILTED ON ITS AXIS.]\r\n\r\nWe have given a couple of experiments to show that the Earth turns on\r\nits own axis, and here is one to make it clear how the Earth travels\r\nin a great circle, or rather _ellipse_, round the Sun and gives us our\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Earth’s axis being tilted away from the axis of the orbit,\r\nits movement round the Sun causes the north pole to be turned toward\r\nthe Sun half of the time, and then the south pole to be turned toward\r\nthe Sun an equal length of time, which gives each of them a day and a\r\nnight that is six months long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—LIGHT IN ROOM TO REPRESENT SUN.]\r\n\r\nIn the center of a large room set a light so that it will be about as\r\nhigh as your eyes. Let this light represent the Sun; you must play now\r\nthat you are the Earth, and think of the pictures on the wall as being\r\nthe stars fixed in the sky away off in space. Now walk in a circle\r\naround the light toward the right and facing the light all the time. As\r\nyou move around the light you will see that it _seems_ to move in the\r\nopposite direction and that it _seems_ to move past the pictures on the\r\nwall. The experiment is shown in Fig. 76.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is exactly what happens when we look at the Sun and the\r\nstars. The Earth moves round the Sun in a circle, nearly, and since the\r\nSun is so much closer to us than any of the other fixed stars the Sun\r\napparently moves by the stars, because the Earth changes its position\r\nrelative to it and the stars.\r\n\r\n=The Earth Turning Round the Sun Makes the Seasons.=—We have seen how\r\nthe days and nights would be equal all over the world if the equator of\r\nthe Earth was in a plane with the Sun, but since the Earth is tilted\r\nthe days and nights are unequal except twice a year, and this is when\r\nthe places where the _ecliptic_ and the _equator_ cross each other are\r\nfacing the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77—TOP SPRING ON PLATE.]\r\n\r\nAgain, if the Earth’s equator was always in a plane with the Sun the\r\nday would be just as long as the night all through the year and there\r\nwould be no seasons. But the Earth having its axis tilted, and which is\r\nalways set in the same direction, together with the Earth speeding in\r\na circle around the Sun, causes some curious things to happen and the\r\nseasons are one of them.\r\n\r\nTo make clearer the reason the axis of the Earth always stays in one\r\nposition take a top and give it a good spin. The top, of course, turns\r\nround its axis very fast, and this is like the Earth turning round its\r\naxis every 24 hours.\r\n\r\nNow, if you place the blunt end of a pencil on the upper axis of the\r\nspinning top, as shown in Fig. 77, and try to tilt it in some other\r\ndirection than that it took when it began to spin, you will find it\r\nrather a hard thing to do. In other words, once a body is rapidly\r\nturning on its own axis it very strongly tends to keep its axis\r\npointing in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThis rule also applies to the Earth, for having been tilted at an angle\r\nwhen it was thrown off by the Sun in the making, no other forces have\r\never been able to change the position of its axis to any great extent,\r\nthough, the Earth spins easily on its axis and also revolves round the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nTo understand how the seasons are made you must first have clearly in\r\nmind the positions of the tilted Earth in different parts of its orbit\r\nround the Sun. The things needed for this experiment are a nice round\r\napple, a candle, a piece of string, a safety-pin and a knitting needle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—CIRCLE AROUND CANDLE MARKED WITH SEASONS.]\r\n\r\nPlace the candle in the center of a table and call it the Sun; draw a\r\ncircle a foot in diameter on the table top and around the candle with\r\na bit of chalk. Mark one side September 22; at the next quarter of the\r\ncircle mark December 21; directly opposite the September mark chalk in\r\nMarch 21, and finally between March and September mark June 21, all of\r\nwhich is shown in Fig. 78.\r\n\r\nPush the knitting needle through the center of the apple, call the\r\napple the Earth and call one end of the knitting needle the north pole\r\nand the other end the south pole. Fasten the safety-pin through the\r\nskin of the apple and tie the string to the pin so that when the string\r\nis tied to a tack in the ceiling or some one is holding it directly\r\nover the candle the knitting needle of the apple will be tilted to the\r\nperpendicular, as shown in Fig. 79.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—APPLE TO REPRESENT EARTH SUSPENDED IN AIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—POSITION OF THE EARTH AND SUN IN AUTUMN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—POSITION OF THE EARTH AND SUN IN WINTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—POSITION OF THE EARTH AND SUN IN SPRING.]\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—POSITION OF THE EARTH AND SUN IN SUMMER.]\r\n\r\nNow grasp the top of the needle, which is the north pole, with the left\r\nhand and hold the apple away from the candle, as shown in Fig. 80. This\r\nis the position of the earth to the Sun on September 22, when the Sun\r\npasses directly over the Earth’s equator, and for us autumn is at hand.\r\n\r\nNow pull the apple by its north pole toward you and around one quarter\r\nof the circle chalked on the table, as shown in Fig. 81, which is the\r\nposition of the Earth to the Sun on December 21. You will see that the\r\nnorth pole is away from the light and heat and hence it is dark and\r\nwinter there; but the south pole on the other end is getting plenty\r\nof light and heat and it is both day and summer there. This marks the\r\nbeginning of our winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—CYCLE OF SEASONS.]\r\n\r\nPush the apple by its north pole—always being careful to keep the\r\nknitting needle tilted in the same position—around another quarter of a\r\ncircle and this is where the Earth is in its orbit, and its position\r\nto the Sun on about March 21. Once again the Sun is over the Earth’s\r\nequator and all parts or our world are then lighted and heated twelve\r\nhours out of the twenty-four, and we have the beginning of spring. See\r\nFig. 82.\r\n\r\nAgain push the apple around another quarter circle and June 21 is\r\nreached. This time you will find the north pole is turned toward the\r\nSun and this time it gets the light and heat for six months, while the\r\nsouth pole is away from the Sun and takes its turn of six months of\r\nnight and winter. To us, however, it is the beginning of summer. Fig.\r\n83 shows the position of the Earth to the Sun at this time.\r\n\r\nPull the apple one more quarter of the circle round the candle and you\r\nwill have completed its orbit just as the Earth swings round the Sun in\r\n365 days. The seasons are more clearly shown in Fig. 84.\r\n\r\n=The North Pole.=—The north pole is not only one of the ends of the\r\naxis round which the Earth turns but close to it is the _north magnetic\r\npole_ as well. By _magnetic_ we mean that the Earth behaves like a\r\nsteel bar that has been magnetized.\r\n\r\nA steel bar magnet like that shown in Fig. 85 is strongest at its ends.\r\nOne end is _positively_ magnetized, and we call this end its _north\r\npole_, and the other end is _negatively_ magnetized, and we call this\r\nend its _south pole_.\r\n\r\nMagnetic lines of force stream from the south pole through the steel\r\nbar and reaching the north pole they stream through the air to the\r\nsouth pole, as shown by the curved lines, thus forming a _magnetic\r\ncircuit_, just as two wires joined together may form an electric\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nIf we place a compass needle near the steel bar magnet the needle will\r\nturn in the same direction as the magnetic lines of force are flowing,\r\nand it will, therefore, point to the north and to the south poles of\r\nthe magnet.\r\n\r\nNow the Earth is a great magnet with a positive pole, which we call the\r\nnorth pole at one end of its axis, and a negative pole, which we call\r\nthe south pole, at the other end of its axis, as shown in Fig. 86.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—LINES OF FORCE THROUGH AND AROUND A MAGNET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—LINES OF FORCE AROUND THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\nLike a bar magnet, magnetic lines of force stream all over the Earth’s\r\nsurface from the north pole to the south pole, and a compass needle\r\nplaced anywhere on the Earth will swing round until it is in the same\r\ndirection as the lines of magnetic force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—WATCH SPRING—NEEDLE FOR COMPASS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—COMPASS COMPLETE.]\r\n\r\n=How to Make a Simple Compass.=—Take a piece of watch spring about 3\r\ninches long and straighten it. Heat the middle red-hot and let it cool\r\nslowly, when the temper will be taken out of it at this point. Place\r\na center punch in the middle of the spring and strike it a sharp blow\r\nwith a hammer; this will make a little dent in it. Bend it as shown in\r\nFig. 87. To magnetize the needle rub one end on the north pole and the\r\nother end on the south pole of a steel magnet. Stick a sewing needle\r\ninto a large cork and lay the magnetized needle on it, when it will\r\npoint north and south, as shown in Fig. 88.\r\n\r\n=Boxing the Compass.=—There are two kinds of compasses in general\r\nuse, though both kinds use a magnetized needle. The first kind is the\r\nordinary pocket compass, with either a pull-off cover or one of the\r\nwatch-case pattern. In this kind of a compass the magnetic needle is\r\nfitted with a jeweled center which swings on a steel needle; the dial\r\nis fixed in the case and is marked with the _cardinal points_, that is\r\nwith the chief points of a compass. Fig. 89 shows a pocket watch-case\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—POCKET WATCH-CASE COMPASS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—DIAL OF MARINER’S COMPASS.]\r\n\r\nIn the mariner’s compass, which is used at sea, the compass card and\r\nthe magnetic needle are fastened together. The card is made of a\r\ncircular sheet of mica and the points of the compass, which are called\r\n_rhumbs_, are marked on the edge. The needle and card float in a bowl\r\nof mercury.\r\n\r\nThe card is marked with 32 _rays_, forming a many-pointed star, and\r\neach of these points has a name, the names of the four _cardinal\r\npoints_ being _north_, _east_, _south_ and _west_. To know all of the\r\npoints by heart and be able to name them, beginning with the north and\r\ngoing round the card to the north again, is what sailors call _boxing\r\nthe compass_.

At the\r\nmagnetic equator there is no dip, that is, the needle will stand\r\n_parallel_ with the Earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—NEEDLE FOR DIPPING NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\nAt the north magnetic pole the needle will stand straight up and down\r\nin a line with the axis of the Earth. The dip, therefore, of the needle\r\nat any place on the Earth’s surface is just about that of the latitude\r\nof the place where it is used. Dipping needles are also used by miners\r\nfor finding iron ores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.—DIPPING NEEDLE COMPLETE.]\r\n\r\nTo make a dipping needle, slip a small cork over a knitting needle and\r\npush a sewing needle through the cork at right angles to the knitting\r\nneedle, as shown in Fig. 91. Now lay the sewing needle with its ends\r\non the edges of two tumblers, and see that the knitting needle is\r\nperfectly balanced. This done, magnetize the knitting needle by rubbing\r\none end on the north pole of a steel magnet and the other end on the\r\nsouth pole of the magnet. Make a little wood stand as shown in Fig. 92\r\nand place the ends of the sewing needle on the wood supports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—PROTRACTOR SHOWING DEGREES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—EARTH SURFACE DIVIDED INTO DEGREES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latitude running through the middle of the United States is about\r\n40 degrees north of the equator and if you live in this latitude the\r\ndip of your needle will be about 40 degrees from the horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—PROTRACTOR SET BY DIPPING NEEDLE SHOWING\r\nLATITUDE.]\r\n\r\n=How to Find Latitude.=—The _latitude_ of a place on the Earth’s\r\nsurface is its distance north or south of the equator. This distance is\r\nusually measured in _degrees_ of a circle, instead of in miles.\r\n\r\nThe equator is called 0 (zero) degrees, and the north and south poles\r\nare 90 degrees from the equator, as shown in Fig. 93. If you are in\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, or Quincy, Illinois, or Tehama, California,\r\nyou are in latitude 40 degrees. If you are in Bangor, Maine, St. Paul,\r\nMinnesota, or Portland, Oregon, you are in latitude 45 degrees, or just\r\nhalfway between the north pole and the equator, as Fig. 94 shows.\r\n\r\n(1) An easy way to find roughly the latitude of a place, that is,\r\nits distance from the equator, is to use a dipping needle and a\r\n_protractor_.\r\n\r\nTo make a protractor cut out a semi-circle of stiff, white cardboard,\r\njust the size shown in Fig. 93, and mark the figures on the edge and\r\ndraw lines from the edge to the center point exactly as in the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.—TWO STICKS SCREWED TOGETHER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.—TWO STICKS ACROSS BUCKET OF WATER.]\r\n\r\nNow place your dipping needle on a level board or table and set the\r\ncenter of your cardboard protractor in line and on a level with\r\nthe axis of the needle, as shown in Fig. 95. Whatever line on the\r\nprotractor the dip of the needle takes the degree marked on the edge of\r\nthe protractor will be the magnetic latitude you are in.\r\n\r\n(2) A way to obtain true latitude is to take two smooth pieces of wood,\r\nabout 1 foot long and ¼ inch thick, and hinge them together at one end\r\nwith a screw, as in Fig. 96. Now set a bucket out-of-doors in an open\r\nspace from which the North Star may be seen, fill the bucket with water\r\nand level it up until the water is parallel with the rim all the way\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen night falls find the North Star and set your sticks across the\r\nrim, as shown in Fig. 97. Raise one of the sticks and sight it until it\r\npoints straight at the North Star, and having done this you are through\r\nwith the observation.\r\n\r\nTake the sticks into the house, being very careful not to change their\r\nrelative positions, so that the _angle_ they form can be measured\r\nwith a protractor. Tack a piece of paper on your starboard and draw a\r\nstraight horizontal line on it.\r\n\r\nLay the stick that was on the bucket on the horizontal line, and draw a\r\nline along the edge of the other stick with which you sighted the North\r\nStar, as in Fig. 98.\r\n\r\nNow measure the distance, in degrees, between the two lines with your\r\nprotractor and the number of degrees you get will be roughly the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n=Shooting the Sun.=—Another and very exact way to find the latitude,\r\nand which is also used to help find longitude when at sea, is by means\r\nof an instrument known as a _sextant_, so called from the fact that it\r\nis formed of a sixth part of a circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—PROTRACTOR AND STICKS ON DRAWING PAPER.]\r\n\r\nIt is made with a metal frame A and having the degrees marked on its\r\ncurved edge B like a protractor. On one end of a thin strip of metal,\r\nor arm, C (see Fig. 99), a mirror, D, called an _index mirror_, is\r\nrigidly fastened, and right under the center of this mirror the arm C\r\nis hinged to the frame A. The other end of this arm slides over the\r\nscale B.\r\n\r\nTo the left side of the frame also rigidly fastened is a second glass E\r\ncalled a _horizon glass_, and half of which is clear and half silvered.\r\nA _telescope_ is also rigidly fastened to the frame A directly opposite\r\nbut in a line with the horizon glass E.\r\n\r\nNow to find the latitude by _taking the Sun_, or as sailors sometimes\r\ncall it, _shooting the Sun_, in order to learn the position of the ship\r\nat sea, the sextant is held in both hands firmly, and the horizon which\r\nis sighted through the telescope is brought into view through the clear\r\npart of the horizon glass E.\r\n\r\nThe arm C, carrying the index mirror D, is now moved over the scale A\r\nuntil the light from the Sun just as it crosses the meridian at noon is\r\nreflected by its polished surface into the silvered part of the horizon\r\nglass E, and this reflects the sunlight into the telescope right in a\r\nline with the line of sight to the horizon. This forms an angle of the\r\ntwo beams of light just as an angle is formed of the two sticks of wood\r\nin the pail experiment and the number of degrees the end of the arm C\r\npoints to on the scale B is the latitude in degrees or the distance of\r\nthe ship north or south of the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.—SEXTANT IN USE. SHOOTING THE SUN.]\r\n\r\n=How Longitude is Found.=—To find the longitude at sea, that is, the\r\nposition of a ship east or west of a given place, is just as simple a\r\nmatter as finding the latitude or its position north or south of the\r\nequator. Two instruments are used to find longitude, and these are the\r\nsextant, which has just been described, and a very accurate clock,\r\ncalled a _chronometer_ (pronounced chro-nom´-e-ter).\r\n\r\nAs you know, imaginary lines running from the north pole to the south\r\npole are called _meridians of longitude_. Now the Earth has been\r\ndivided into 24 of these lines, the zero meridian, from which distances\r\neast and west are measured, running through Greenwich, England.\r\n\r\nThere are 24 of these _standard meridians_ and hence they are 15\r\ndegrees apart—since there are 360 degrees in a circle—and they are 1\r\nhour apart—since there are 24 hours in a day, and therefore 15 degrees\r\nequal 1 hour. (See Chapter X, _The Time o’ Day_.)\r\n\r\nNow, since it is 12 o’clock noon when the Sun passes over any one of\r\nthese standard meridians, it will be 11 o’clock A. M., 15 degrees west\r\nof it, and 1 o’clock P. M., 15 degrees east of it, and consequently\r\nthere will be an hour’s difference in the time, either fast or slow,\r\nfor every 15 degrees, depending on whether you count east or west from\r\nthe noon meridian.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a sextant in finding longitude on shipboard is to know\r\nwhen it is exactly noon by the Sun, and in this way the _local time_\r\nis found. The purpose of a chronometer is to carry exact _Greenwich\r\ntime_, and the difference between the _local time_ found each day by\r\ntaking the Sun, and _Greenwich time_ shown by the chronometer gives the\r\ndistance in degrees the ship has traveled from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nBy knowing the latitude and longitude of a ship the distance in miles\r\nnorth and south and east and west from any port can be figured out\r\nwithout much trouble.\r\n\r\nThe reason that a very accurate clock has to be carried is that a\r\ndifference of a few seconds either too fast or too slow will affect\r\nthe calculations just that much, and this means that the ship will be\r\nthrown out of its calculated position by several miles.\r\n\r\nTo correct the observations with the sextant and the inaccuracy of\r\nthe chronometer, etc., are a part of the business of the navigating\r\nofficer, and he is provided with tables and things to make this work as\r\neasy and certain as is possible.\r\n\r\n=How to Know When You Are at the North Pole.=—If you should ever reach\r\nthe north pole where overhead is north and every other direction is\r\nsouth how would you know it?\r\n\r\nSuppose you were standing on the exact top of the world during one of\r\nits long polar nights, then the North Star would be directly over your\r\nhead and the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia would serve to mark the passing\r\nof days as well as of nights, that is, if you were at the north pole in\r\nthe wintertime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.—SHADOWS AT THE NORTH POLE.]\r\n\r\nBut if you were there during a long Arctic day, that is, in the good\r\nold summertime, you could see the Sun making a circle, or seeming to,\r\nonce in 24 hours, parallel to the horizon, and never going higher or\r\ngetting lower.\r\n\r\nExplorers use a sextant to find out when they are at the north pole,\r\nand they sight the Sun’s height above the horizon at morning, noon and\r\nnight. If the angle the Sun makes with the horizon is the same every\r\ntime he is observed, the explorer knows he is standing on the very\r\npoint round which the Earth turns. Then he plants a stick in the snow\r\nand ice on the north pole, hoists the American flag, and hurries home\r\nas fast as dogs and ships and trains can carry him to tell about it.\r\n\r\nIf you ever reach the north pole you can know it, too, even though you\r\nhaven’t a sextant with you. All you need to do, when you think you are\r\nstanding on the north pole, is to notice the length of your shadow five\r\nor six times in 24 hours. If the length of your shadow is exactly the\r\nsame every time you look at it, as shown in Fig. 100, you are really\r\nand truly at the north pole.\r\n\r\n=Difference Between the True North Pole and the Magnetic North\r\nPole.=—The compass and dipping needle do not point to the _true north\r\npole_, for the _magnetic north pole_ and the true north pole are not\r\nlocated at the same place.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic north pole was found by Captain Ross in 1832. At that time\r\nthe magnetic north pole was northwest of Hudson’s Bay in about latitude\r\n70 degrees north and longitude 96 degrees and 45 minutes west, that is,\r\nwest of the zero meridian which runs through Greenwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MOON, THE EARTH’S DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n\r\n=How the Moon Was Made.=—There was a time away back in the beginning of\r\nthe planets when the Earth did not have a Moon.\r\n\r\nTwo ideas among others have been worked out to account for the birth\r\nof the Moon and these are somewhat alike, for both agree that just as\r\nthe Earth was once a part of the Sun and was separated from the Sun and\r\nbecame a planet so the Moon was once a part of the Earth and was thrown\r\noff and became her daughter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—MOON AND EARTH JOINED TOGETHER LIKE A\r\nDUMBBELL.]\r\n\r\nThe first idea as to how the Moon was made is that a smaller core was\r\nformed in the gaseous matter of the Earth and that this core and the\r\ncore of the Earth, which were at first joined together like a dumbbell,\r\nas shown in Fig. 101, began to spread apart like a pair of balls\r\nfastened together with a piece of elastic when they are whirled rapidly\r\nround each other, as shown in Fig. 102.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—BALLS CONNECTED WITH AN ELASTIC.]\r\n\r\nSo, too, the high speed with which the Earth turned on its axis when it\r\nwas in the making caused the smaller part to slowly move away and it\r\nbecame the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe second idea is like the first, except that the Earth is thought to\r\nhave cooled down until it was a melted mass, and it was then that a\r\ngreat upheaval took place in which a part, one-eightieth as large as\r\nthat of the world itself, was torn out of its side and, whirling away\r\nby centrifugal force, the Moon was born.\r\n\r\nTo throw off such a mighty part of its bulk as the Moon, it has been\r\nfigured out that the Earth must have made a complete turn on its axis\r\nevery 2 hours, instead of one turn in 24 hours, as it now does; and it\r\nwas while the Earth was turning at this terrific rate of speed that the\r\ncentrifugal force overcame the force of gravitation and tore the Moon\r\nfrom the Earth’s side and formed a little world of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.—MAP SHOWING PACIFIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nIt is believed by some astronomers that the Moon was once that part of\r\nthe Earth which is now filled up by the waters of the Pacific Ocean and\r\nthere are several reasons why this seems very likely.\r\n\r\nFirst, if the waters which form the Pacific Ocean were rolled into a\r\nbig ball it would be just about the size of the Moon; second, the space\r\nbetween the coasts of North and South America on the east, and Asia\r\nand Australia on the west, will be seen by referring to Fig. 103 to be\r\nroughly circular in form; third, there is a marked likeness between the\r\nvolcanoes in California, in the Hawaiian Islands and in Japan to those\r\non the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—IMITATING THE VOLCANOES IN THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nIt was, doubtless, at this long ago time that the great volcanoes of\r\nthe Moon, as well as those of the coasts of and on the islands in the\r\nPacific Ocean were made, but what caused them can only be guessed\r\nat. There are two ideas, also, to account for them; one is that the\r\npent-up gases inside the Earth and the Moon exploded and so threw up\r\nthe volcanoes; the other idea is that showers of gigantic melted masses\r\nfell on the surface of both the Earth and Moon and so caused them.\r\n\r\nAn experiment to show how the volcanoes might have been formed by\r\nshowers of meteors can be made by covering the surface of your\r\nstarboard with a layer of soft clay about 4 inches thick, and then\r\nthrowing clay balls against it. Artificial volcanoes with craters and\r\nall will result. Compare your artificial volcanoes with Fig. 105,\r\nshowing the real volcanoes on the Moon, and you will see they are quite\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.—REAL VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of California, Japan and the Hawaiian Islands are, many\r\nof them, still active, while those on the Moon have long since become\r\nextinct. This is easily accounted for, since the mass of the Moon is\r\nvery small compared with that of the Earth, and hence, the Moon has\r\ncooled off more quickly than the Earth. The result is that while the\r\nEarth is yet hot and teeming with life and activity, the Moon is cold,\r\nand dead and silent.\r\n\r\n=Seeing the Moon With the Naked Eye.=—If you look at the full Moon with\r\nthe naked eye it will appear as a great, silvery-bright disk, and about\r\nthe same size as the Sun.\r\n\r\nLook again and you will see that some parts of it are much brighter\r\nthan others, while another and closer observation will show you that\r\nthe light and shaded parts take on the expression of a man’s face, as\r\nshown in Fig. 106. This is the famous _Man in the Moon_, and once you\r\nmake out the likeness you will never again be able to look the full\r\nMoon in the face without seeing the man in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106—NAKED EYE DRAWING OF FULL MOON.]\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the Moon we always see the same side of it, which will\r\nbe readily understood when we come to the turning of the Moon on its\r\naxis. As the Moon revolves about the Earth, you will see, if you look\r\ntoward the west at the right time of the month, just at dusk, a pale\r\n_crescent_ of light, and very soon after the Sun sets it drops out of\r\nsight below the horizon.\r\n\r\nA few nights later the Moon will be seen, over in the sky toward the\r\neast; its crescent shape grown into the first quarter, and the Moon\r\nlooks as if it was split in two. As the nights go by the Moon _waxes_\r\nuntil it is _gibbous_ and finally the full Moon—with the man in\r\nit—stands out round and clear and bright.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea at this time, that is, when the Moon is full, to make\r\na drawing of her face, and the best time to do it is shortly after\r\ntwilight, for later in the evening the Moon is so bright it is hard to\r\nsee the details. After this the Moon begins to _wane_; it again becomes\r\ngibbous; then reaches its last quarter later only a crescent can be\r\nseen, and she finally disappears.\r\n\r\nAt times when the crescent is bright the whole dark disk of the Moon\r\ncan be seen glowing dimly with a reddish, copper color, and this is\r\ncalled the _old Moon in the new Moon’s arms_. This copper-colored glow\r\nis the _Earth-shine_ on the Moon, that is, the sunlight on the Earth,\r\nwhich is reflected to the Moon and back again to us.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the Moon you may be able to see a dark oval spot which\r\nis marked _Grimaldi_ on the maps of the Moon. Grimaldi is a great\r\nplain, having nearly 14,000 square miles in it, with mountains flanking\r\nit on the sides. This is another good eyesight test, for it takes a\r\nmighty sharp eye to see it without a glass.\r\n\r\nThese and a dozen other interesting things on the Moon can be seen\r\nwithout a telescope.\r\n\r\n=The Motions of the Moon.=—The Moon turns round on its axis once every\r\nmonth and it also revolves round the Earth once every month, so that\r\nthe Moon’s day and year are of the same length just like Mercury and\r\nVenus, and this is the reason that one side of the Moon is always\r\nturned toward the Earth, as you will see if you look at her through a\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—THE EXPERIMENT SHOWING HOW ONE REVOLUTION OF\r\nTHE MOON ROUND THE EARTH MAKES IT TURN ONCE ROUND ITS AXIS.]\r\n\r\nA simple experiment will show the cause of this: Place an apple, which\r\nwe will call the Earth, on the bottom of an inverted glass on a table,\r\nand draw a chalk circle a foot in diameter around it. Next, take a\r\ntablespoon to represent the Moon, and hold it upright with the point of\r\nits bowl on the chalk line and with the bowl turned toward the apple,\r\nas shown in Fig. 107. Now, draw the spoon round the circle, turning it\r\nin your fingers so that the bowl is always toward the apple.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that in order for the bowl of the spoon to be turned\r\ntoward the apple during all of its travels round the chalk circle the\r\nspoon must also turn once round on its own axis, and this is the reason\r\nwe always see the same side of the Moon.\r\n\r\n=The Moon’s Phases.=—Since one side of the Moon is always turned toward\r\nthe Earth, it is clear that this is the only side we can ever see, and,\r\nfurther, we are only able to see as much of this side as is made bright\r\nby the Sun’s light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.—APPLE CUT TO SHOW CRESCENT.]\r\n\r\nThe different _aspects_ we get of the Moon as it revolves round the\r\nEarth are called the _Moon’s phases_; and each phase has a name, as\r\nthe _new moon_; the _first quarter_; the _full moon_, and the _last\r\nquarter_.\r\n\r\nBetween the new Moon and the first quarter, and between the last\r\nquarter and the new Moon only a crescent, or sickle-like edge of the\r\nMoon, can be seen; while between the full Moon and last quarter the\r\nMoon is gibbous (pronounced gib´-us and meaning swelled, or shaped like\r\na football).\r\n\r\nIf you will look at the picture, Fig. 108, and the diagrams, Figs. 109\r\nand 110, and do the experiment which follows, the way the phases of the\r\nMoon are made will be perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nThe picture, Fig. 108, shows an apple from which a thin _sector_ or\r\nslice has been cut. The lower picture shows the stem end of the apple\r\nand from this point of view the part where the slice was cut out looks\r\nwedge-shaped. This is the view of the Moon shown in Fig. 109, if we\r\ncould look down on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—DIAGRAM SHOWING HOW THE MOON’S PHASES ARE\r\nMADE.]\r\n\r\nNow turn the apple on its side and the place where the slice was cut\r\nout can be seen from the stem to the blossom end of the apple when it\r\ntakes on a crescent form. This is the view of the Moon we really get\r\nbetween new Moon and its first quarter, as shown in Fig. 110.\r\n\r\nThe diagrams, Figs. 109 and 110, show the Earth in the center of the\r\nMoon’s orbit and the Moon is pictured in eight positions, as it moves\r\nround the Earth, one for each phase, while the sunlight falling upon\r\nthe Earth and the Moon is shown by streamers of light from the Sun\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe diagram, Fig. 110, shows how the sunlight falls on the Moon, but\r\nyou must always keep in mind that only that part of the Moon which is\r\nin the sunlight and which is also inside of the line of its orbit can\r\nbe seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.—DIAGRAM OF THE MOON’S PHASES AS WE SEE THEM.]\r\n\r\nStarting now with the new Moon, Fig. 109, it will be seen that the\r\nMoon is directly between the Earth and the Sun and hence that part of\r\nthe Moon toward the Earth is in the shadow. Now, since the eye can see\r\nnothing in the sky which is not shining, and since the Moon rises and\r\nsets at the same time as the Sun, we cannot see it. As the Moon moves\r\non round the Earth in the direction of the arrow and while half of it\r\nis in the light and half of it is in the shadow as before, from our\r\nposition we are now able to see a narrow strip of its bright surface\r\nwhich in Fig. 109 is shown as a wedge, but since we are looking at it\r\nfrom an angle we see it as a crescent, as shown in Fig. 110.\r\n\r\nThe Moon having reached its first quarter sets at midnight and from the\r\nEarth half of its bright surface can be seen, which of course is only\r\none quarter of the Moon’s whole surface. The next phase of the Moon is\r\nwhen nearly all of its bright side can be seen. This is the gibbous\r\nphase and the Moon then seems to be about the shape of a football.\r\n\r\nAfter the gibbous phase the full moon appears and this takes place in\r\nthat part of the sky opposite the setting Sun. When the Moon is full it\r\nshines all night and does not set until sunrise.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on the bright part of the Moon which we can see grows\r\nless and the gibbous phase again takes place. Soon the Moon reaches its\r\nlast quarter and gradually the straight rough edge is hollowed out and\r\nanother crescent is formed. The Moon is now in the east and the horns\r\nof the crescent point to the west, just opposite to the direction the\r\nhorns of the new Moon pointed. The horns of the new and old crescents\r\nalways point away from the Sun and this also is a good thing to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nTo show how the Moon changes its phases perform the following simple\r\nexperiment: Peel half an orange and push a knitting needle through its\r\ncenter and let this be the Moon. Your eyes will serve for the Earth and\r\na lighted lamp will make a very good Sun, all of which is shown in Fig.\r\n111.\r\n\r\nHold the orange by the knitting needle well out from your body with the\r\npeeled side toward you, and in such a position that the orange will be\r\nbetween your eyes and the lamp. The side of the orange toward you will\r\nbe in the shadow and this represents the new Moon.\r\n\r\nNow slowly turn your body round to the left and always hold the orange\r\nwith the peeled side toward you. You will see that the light from the\r\nlamp striking the orange forms a crescent with its horns pointing away\r\nfrom the light.\r\n\r\nKeep on turning, a little at a time, and soon a quarter of the orange\r\nwill reflect the light and this is like the first quarter of the Moon.\r\nWhen you have turned nearly halfway round nearly half of the orange\r\nwill shine by the reflected light of the lamp and you will have a fair\r\nexample of the gibbous Moon.\r\n\r\nWhen you have turned your back to the light hold the orange above your\r\nhead so that your shadow will not hide it; now half of the orange—the\r\nhalf that is peeled—reflects the lamp-light and represents the Moon\r\nwhen it is full.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.—BOY, LAMP AND ORANGE SHOWING PHASES OF MOON.]\r\n\r\nAs you keep turning round the amount of light reflected by the orange,\r\nwhich you can see grows less and less, the bright part at first being\r\ngibbous, then the last quarter is seen, after that a thin crescent,\r\nand finally when you have turned completely round the orange is again\r\nbetween your eyes and the light, hence it can no longer be seen, and\r\nthe new Moon phase is again at hand.\r\n\r\n=The Harvest and Hunter’s Moon.=—You will remember that on September\r\n21 the days and nights are equal and this is called the _Autumn\r\nEquinox_. The full moon that falls nearest to September 21 is called\r\nthe _Harvest Moon_ as it rises at nearly the same hour for several\r\nnights in succession and this makes several long moonlight evenings in\r\nsuccession. The _Hunter’s Moon_ follows the Harvest Moon.\r\n\r\n=How the Moon Makes the Tides.=—When we are at the seashore we soon see\r\nthat there is a regular rise and fall of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis rise and fall of the waters is called the _tide_, and if we note\r\nthe time when the waters have reached the highest point—which is called\r\n_high tide_—we will find that a little over six hours later the waters\r\nhave reached their lowest point—or _low tide_.\r\n\r\nBefore the tide has reached the high point again another six hours and\r\nsome minutes have passed so that from one high tide to another high\r\ntide 12 hours and 25 minutes have elapsed. These tides are chiefly\r\ncaused by two forces acting on the oceans, one being the attraction of\r\nthe Moon for the Earth, and the other being the centrifugal force set\r\nup by the Earth’s motion round its axis.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Moon’s attraction for the Earth is to pull the water\r\nof the ocean on the side of the Earth nearest it, and this forms a\r\nbulge, or great wave, while on the other side of the Earth the Moon’s\r\nattraction is smaller for the water than it is for the solid Earth,\r\nso the Earth is pulled away from the water. Thus two tidal waves are\r\nformed at the same time, one on each side of the Earth, as shown in\r\nFig. 112.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.—ATTRACTION OF THE MOON CAUSES THE TIDES.]\r\n\r\nSince the Earth revolves round its axis once in 24 hours these tidal\r\nwaves go round the Earth and as there are two tidal waves each day\r\nthere are two high tides and two low tides at every place on the ocean,\r\nbut these are chiefly noticeable on the coasts. Fig. 112 shows the\r\nposition of the Moon and the Earth, while the wavy lines around the\r\nEarth represent the oceans.\r\n\r\n=Spring Tides and Neap Tides.=—Not only does the Moon’s attraction\r\ncause the tides, but the Sun’s pull on the Earth also produces tides.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun and Moon are in a line with the Earth they pull together\r\nand the tides are raised very high and they fall very low, and these\r\nhigh and low tides are called _spring tides_.\r\n\r\nSince we have either new Moon or full Moon, when the Sun, Earth and\r\nMoon are in a line, the spring tides occur at these times, or twice\r\nevery month. Figs. 113 and 114 show how the spring tides are formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.—HOW SPRING TIDES ARE FORMED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.—HOW SPRING TIDES ARE FORMED.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon is at its first quarter, as in Fig. 115, or in its last\r\nquarter, as in Fig. 116, the Sun’s pull and the Moon’s pull oppose each\r\nother and the high tides are lowest. These low high tides, which take\r\nplace twice a month, are called _Neap tides_.\r\n\r\n=A Trip to the Moon.=—Many stories have been told about imaginary\r\ntrips to the Moon and what the adventurers saw after reaching their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nOur story is made up of facts and the only thing we shall imagine is\r\nthat we have made the trip and set foot somewhere on the Moon. Having\r\nperformed this mental somersault we shall carefully leave out all the\r\nhard questions about living there without air and water, for this is a\r\npleasure trip and we don’t want to spoil the fun with details.\r\n\r\nOn landing after our 240,000-mile trip we find that there is not only\r\nneither air nor water, but that the Moon is stone cold; even when the\r\nSun shines on it, it is freezing cold, while the temperature drops to\r\nperhaps 300 degrees below zero when the Moon’s night comes on.\r\n\r\nOur next observation will probably be that we feel much lighter than\r\nwe did on Earth and we are lighter in the very nature of things, for\r\nthe weight of bodies on the Moon is only one-sixth as much as they are\r\non the Earth. This is due to the Moon being so small and light that\r\ngravity has only one-sixth as great an attractive force there as it has\r\non the Earth.\r\n\r\nSupposing we still retained on the Moon as much strength as we had on\r\nthe Earth; then every time we took a step we would cover a distance\r\nof 15 or 20 feet; if we jumped we would sail through space with the\r\nagility of a Harlem goat, and if we played ball and batted the sphere\r\nfairly it would shoot off a quarter of a mile and go twice as far from\r\nthe home plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.—HOW NEAP TIDES ARE FORMED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.—HOW NEAP TIDES ARE FORMED.]\r\n\r\nSince there is no air on the Moon, in order to see one another the Sun\r\nwould have to shine directly on us, and if by any chance we should\r\nget into a shadow we would be as completely lost to view as if we had\r\nfallen into one of the craters, for a shadow on the Moon is as deep and\r\nblack as the darkest night you ever saw on Earth. Shadows as we know\r\nthem on the Earth are always softened, for the air scatters the light.\r\n\r\nNor would it do us any good to cry out or whistle, for, since sound\r\nwaves are carried by the air, and since there is no air on the Moon,\r\nall our efforts to make ourselves heard would be useless, even if we\r\nwere only a few feet from each other. The Moon is just as silent and\r\ncold and still as it looks, for, though it serves the Earth well as\r\na mirror to reflect the Sun’s light, it is, after all, only a great,\r\nburned-out cinder.\r\n\r\nLooking at the sky at night from the Moon, we are surprised to find how\r\nmuch bigger and brighter the stars seem, and how many more of them can\r\nbe seen, than from the Earth. Here we see as many with the naked eye as\r\nwe could see from the Earth with a three-inch telescope.\r\n\r\nThe Earth itself is seen like a mighty Moon—a Moon as bright as 40 of\r\nthe Moons we are calling on, and so large is it that we can see, not\r\nonly the continents and oceans, but the polar ice caps and the plains\r\nand the mountains as well, as we see objects of same size on Moon, as\r\nshown in Fig. 117.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.—VIEW OF THE EARTH FROM THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nWatching the Earth from this new viewpoint, we see it turn on its axis\r\nevery 24 hours and going through all the phases—crescent, quarter,\r\ngibbous and full, and back to crescent again, just as the Moon does\r\nwhen we see it from the Earth.\r\n\r\nMore curious than the Earth is the view we get of the Sun from the\r\nMoon, the lack of air making the seeing so good that the spots on the\r\nSun, the fiery prominences and the thin corona can all be easily seen\r\nwith the naked eye.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon is new the whole half of the Earth that is turned toward\r\nthe Moon is sunlit and by its reflected light we can easily read our\r\ntime-card—for we must get back to Earth again and either write a book\r\nor lecture about the wonders we have seen.\r\n\r\n=The Moon and the Weather.=—We have seen in Chapter III that our\r\nweather is entirely dependent on the Sun. Still it is believed by many\r\npersons today that the Moon has also something to do with the changes\r\nin the weather, just as it is the cause of the tides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—TELLING TIME BY THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nHence there have been handed down to us a large number of old sayings\r\nto show what the weather will be during certain phases of the Moon. But\r\nit has been proved by records kept of the weather that the Moon has\r\nnothing whatever to do with it. For this reason no reliance is to be\r\nplaced in any forecast of the weather which is founded on changes of\r\nthe Moon.\r\n\r\n=How to Tell Time by the Moon.=—After having learned how to tell the\r\nhour of the day by the Sun you should learn to tell the hour of the\r\nnight by the Moon.\r\n\r\nOn some nights this is a very simple thing to do, for when the Moon is\r\nfull it is due south at exactly 12 o’clock midnight, as shown in Fig.\r\n118.\r\n\r\nEvery night before the Moon is full you will find it due south 55\r\nminutes earlier, so that you must subtract 55 minutes from 12 o’clock\r\nfor each day; that is, one day before full Moon it is due south at\r\n11:05 P. M.; two days before full Moon it is due south at 10:10 P. M.;\r\nthree days before full Moon it is due south at 9:15 P. M., and so on.\r\n\r\nAfter the Moon is full it will be due south 55 minutes later every\r\nnight and then you must add 55 minutes to 12 o’clock; that is, one day\r\nafter full Moon it is due south at 12:55 A. M.; two days after full\r\nMoon it is due south at 1:50 A. M.; three days after full Moon it is\r\ndue south at 2:45 A. M., and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Moon’s day is 27½ of our days long.\r\n\r\nThe Moon’s year is 27½ of our days long.\r\n\r\nThe Moon’s diameter is 2,160 miles.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the Moon to the Earth is 240,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOTHER THINGS IN THE SKY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seeing an Eclipse.=—The word _eclipse_ is taken from the Greek and\r\nmeans to fail to appear.\r\n\r\nIn starcraft, when the Earth passes across the Sun, and the Moon is\r\nhidden in its shadow, we say that it is an eclipse of the Moon; or when\r\nthe Moon passes across the Sun and covers it we say that there has been\r\nan eclipse of the Sun.\r\n\r\nHow eclipses of the Sun and of the Moon are caused can be shown by a\r\nvery simple experiment and you ought to make it.\r\n\r\n=An Eclipse of the Moon.=—First let us suppose it is the Moon which is\r\neclipsed by the Earth. All that is needed to show how this is done is\r\na lighted lamp on a table and an apple with a knitting needle through\r\nits center. Let the flame of the lamp represent the Sun, your head the\r\nEarth and the apple the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—ECLIPSE OF THE MOON BY THE EARTH (EXPERIMENT).]\r\n\r\nHold the apple by the knitting needle in a line between your eyes and\r\nthe flame and turn round just as you did in the experiment showing the\r\nphases of the Moon. When you have turned halfway round the apple will\r\nbe in the shadow of your head, when the apple is eclipsed, as shown in\r\nFig. 119.\r\n\r\nThis is just what happens when the Earth gets between the Sun and the\r\nMoon and all these bodies are in a straight line, as shown in Fig. 120;\r\nthe Moon will then be in the shadow of the Earth, and thus it is that\r\nthe Moon is eclipsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.—MOON ECLIPSED BY THE EARTH (DIAGRAM).]\r\n\r\nIf the Sun, Earth and Moon were always in the same plane with each\r\nother, every time the Earth passed between the Sun and the Moon the\r\nlatter would be plunged into the Earth’s shadow and the Moon would be\r\neclipsed. But the Moon does not revolve round the Earth so that it and\r\nthe Earth make a straight line with the Sun every revolution for the\r\nreason that the Moon’s orbit is tilted a little and hence it is only\r\nonce in a while that all of these bodies get in a straight line with\r\neach other, and when these times do happen then eclipses are produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.—THE MOON AS SEEN WHEN IN ECLIPSE.]\r\n\r\nAgain when the Moon is eclipsed it is not always entirely hidden from\r\nview by the great shadow of the Earth, for the air on the Earth sends\r\nthe sunbeams round it so that the shadow is never very deep, and for\r\nthis reason the Moon can still be seen, as shown in Fig. 121. So, then,\r\nsome of these bent sunbeams fall on the Moon and are reflected from its\r\nsurface back to us and it is then that we see the Moon in an entirely\r\nnew light.\r\n\r\nSometimes during an eclipse of the Moon the man can still be seen, but\r\ninstead of having a bright silvery face he will have changed it to the\r\ncopper color of a red Indian. The whole eclipse of the Moon often lasts\r\nlonger than six hours and sometimes the moon is in the deep shadow of\r\nthe Earth as long as two hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.—ECLIPSE OF THE SUN BY THE MOON (EXPERIMENT).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.—THE SUN ECLIPSED BY THE MOON (DIAGRAM).]\r\n\r\nA _total eclipse_ is one in which the Moon passes completely into the\r\nshadow of the Earth, while a _partial eclipse_ is one where only part\r\nof the Moon is in the shadow of the Earth and part of it is in the\r\nsunlight. Eclipses of the Moon occur quite often and you can look up\r\nthe time of the next one in your almanac.\r\n\r\n=Eclipse of the Sun.=—When the Sun is eclipsed it is caused by the Moon\r\npassing between the Earth and the Sun and so the light is cut off from\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nTo show how this is done all that is needed is to continue the\r\nexperiment with the lighted lamp and the apple which you used for the\r\neclipse of the Moon. You will remember in that experiment you were\r\nturned with your back to the lamp and with the apple held in front of\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNow to show how the Sun is eclipsed by the Moon keep on turning round\r\nuntil you face the lighted lamp with the apple in between and in a\r\nstraight line with your eyes and the flame, as shown in Fig. 122.\r\n\r\nAgain you will find that the side of the apple nearest you will be in\r\na deep shadow, though usually it can still be seen, and though you can\r\nsee the light all round the apple yet you cannot see the flame.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what takes place when the Moon gets between the Earth\r\nand the Sun and all of these bodies are in a straight line, as shown\r\nin Fig. 123; the Moon will then cover up the Sun and the shadow of the\r\nMoon will fall upon the Earth in a circle about 100 miles in diameter,\r\nas shown in Fig. 124. It is thus that the Sun is eclipsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.—TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, SHOWING PATH OF THE\r\nSUN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.—TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, FROM PHOTO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.—ANNULAR ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.—PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nAs the Moon is traveling round the Earth and the Earth is turning round\r\non its own axis, the Moon’s shadow moves across a path or trail that is\r\nonly about 100 miles wide, and it moves very fast, too, for it usually\r\ntakes less than five minutes for the Moon to sweep over the face of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of eclipses of the Sun. The first is called a\r\n_total eclipse_, and this takes place when the Moon covers the entire\r\nface of the Sun, as in Fig. 125.\r\n\r\nThe second is called an _annular eclipse_ and this takes place when\r\nthe Moon does not completely cover the Sun but leaves a bright ring\r\nexposed, as shown in Fig. 126. The reason the Moon covers the Sun\r\ncompletely during a total eclipse and does not cover all of it during\r\nan annular eclipse is because the orbit of the Moon around the Earth\r\nis not a perfect circle, and so sometimes the Moon is nearer the Earth\r\nthan at other times and this makes the Moon seem larger or smaller, as\r\nthe case may be.\r\n\r\nThe third kind is called a _partial eclipse_. If we are not in the\r\ndirect path of the shadow of the Moon we may see the Moon pass over\r\nonly a part of the Sun, as shown in Fig. 127.\r\n\r\nThe only total eclipses of the Sun which can be seen in the United\r\nStates in the next 30 years are the following:\r\n\r\n    ---------------+---------------+-----------------------------------\r\n       Date of     |   Time of     |\r\n       Eclipse     | Total Phase   |      Course of Moon’s Shadow\r\n    ---------------+---------------+-----------------------------------\r\n    1918, June  18,|  2 minutes    | Oregon to Florida\r\n    1922, Sept.  2,|  6 minutes    | Pacific Ocean, U.

In the long ago a comet was called a\r\nhairy star, for the early Greeks pictured the tail of a comet as being\r\nmade of long hair and so from their language we get the word comet,\r\nwhich means hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.—COMET SHOWING NUCLEUS, COMA AND TAIL.]\r\n\r\nA comet is really made up of three parts, which are, (1) a bright head\r\nor core, called a _nucleus_, and this is covered with (2) a layer of\r\nhazy light, called a _coma_, to which there is attached (3) a luminous\r\n_tail_, all of which is shown in Fig. 128. The nucleus of a comet is\r\nformed of a bunch of stones and pieces of iron, all widely separated\r\nand which are held together by attraction as they speed through space.\r\nAs a comet nears the Sun it begins to get hot and to throw off burning\r\ngases, which make up its coma, and these bright gases streaming along\r\nform its tail.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which a comet can be told from the planets.\r\nIn the first place, new comets, that is, comets which have never been\r\ndiscovered before, appear suddenly and in any part of the sky, though\r\nthey may be very dim at first, and after a while they fade away,\r\nsometimes never to return again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.—AN ELLIPSE, PARABOLA AND HYPERBOLA.]\r\n\r\nSecond, they shine chiefly with their own light like the stars; third,\r\nthey do not travel in small circles around the Sun like the planets;\r\nbut the paths they take are either long ovals, called _ellipses_,\r\nor great curves whose ends never meet, called _parabolas_ and\r\n_hyperbolas_, as shown in Fig. 129; fourth, they do not travel through\r\nspace in a line with the planets and Sun, but shoot in and out of our\r\nsolar system from and to every direction; and fifth and last, they\r\ntravel at enormously high speeds.\r\n\r\nNow, a comet, however great it may grow to be, never bursts into view,\r\nbig, bright and beautiful, but when one is found it is usually seen as\r\na little, dim patch of light, and it would quite likely be mistaken for\r\na _nebula_, if it did not move along so swiftly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.—HEAD AND TAIL OF COMET DO NOT OBEY THE SAME\r\nLAWS.]\r\n\r\nA comet can be told by its movement and its movement can be plotted in\r\nthe same way I have described for plotting the position of a planet\r\nin Chapter IV; and so, if you see a dim, little ball of light in the\r\nsky and find that it changes its position when compared with the fixed\r\nstars near it you may guess that you have discovered a comet.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you should make sure of is, that you have not found one\r\nof our old familiar friends, the planets. If it is really a great comet\r\ncoming toward the Sun, it will grow larger and brighter every night,\r\nand you will soon be able to see its tail, which is the real earmark of\r\na really truly comet.\r\n\r\nWhen a comet is nearest us its head may shine far brighter than any of\r\nthe planets, and its great tail may be millions of miles in length, and\r\nspread out in a glowing arc and light up the whole sky.\r\n\r\nWhen this time comes a comet is by far a greater sight to the naked eye\r\nthan it is when seen through the largest telescope. You should observe\r\nthe comet often and carefully, for another one may not appear for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.—HALLEY’S COMET, FROM PHOTO.]\r\n\r\nThe nearer a comet gets to the Sun the faster it travels; some comets\r\nhave been known to move a thousand times as fast as a rifle-ball, and\r\nthis is the more surprising when we consider that the great, flaming\r\ntail goes along with it at the same terrific rate of speed.\r\n\r\nThe tails of comets do some very strange things; for example we should\r\nrather expect the tail of a comet to always follow its head like a\r\nskyrocket, but while it does so when the comet is headed toward the\r\nSun, when the comet is passing round and shooting into space the tail\r\nturns away from the Sun, and this causes it to move ahead of the comet,\r\nas shown in Fig. 130.\r\n\r\nThis shows that while the head of a comet obeys the laws of\r\ngravitation, the tail does not do so, but acts as if it was electrified\r\nlike the Sun, when of course it would be repelled by it. Fig. 131 is a\r\npicture of Halley’s comet of 1910.\r\n\r\nAlthough a great astronomer once said that there are more comets in the\r\nsky than fishes in the sea, there have only been 1,000 comets recorded\r\nsince the beginning of written history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.—METEORITE OF IRON ETCHED WITH ACID.]\r\n\r\n=Meteors and Meteorites.=—If you will look at almost any part of the\r\nsky on a clear night when there is no Moon you will no doubt see a\r\nbright flash like a rocket. But if you will scan the sky during the\r\ndark nights of August and November you will be very apt to see dozens\r\nof these shooting stars or meteors.\r\n\r\nNow, _meteors_, _fireballs_, _shooting stars_ and _meteorites_ are all\r\none and the same thing to start with and they have their beginnings\r\nwhen some comet goes to pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter a comet breaks up, the pieces of stone and iron which form it\r\nstill travel round in the same orbit. Some of these pieces may get\r\nwithin range of the Earth’s force of gravitation when they are drawn to\r\nit, and on striking the air they are intensely heated by the friction,\r\nand if they are small they burn up before reaching the ground.\r\n\r\nThe smaller meteors burn up almost instantly and the shining tails\r\nthey leave last only a few seconds. Fireballs, which are simply large\r\nmeteors, leave burning trails which can sometimes be seen for several\r\nminutes. Shooting stars are merely meteors which are not very bright,\r\nwhile meteorites are meteors which have fallen to the Earth before they\r\nhave had time to burn up.\r\n\r\nMany meteorites have been found, but ninety-five out of every hundred\r\nare of the stony kind, the others being of the iron kind. The way to\r\ntell a meteorite from a common stone is by examining its surface. A\r\ntrue meteorite is covered with a black, shiny, burnt crust, caused by\r\nthe intense heat to which it was subjected as it fell through the air.\r\nThe test for an iron meteorite is to grind and polish a part of its\r\nsurface and then cover it with a dilute solution of nitric acid, when\r\nmarkings like those shown in Fig. 132 will be etched upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.—THE MILKY WAY.]\r\n\r\n=The Milky Way.=—You have, no doubt, often seen on a clear, dark night,\r\na wide, ragged band of light stretching from the northern sky across\r\nthe celestial equator and beyond. This band of light is the famous\r\nMilky Way.\r\n\r\nIf, as you were looking at the Milky Way, the Earth could be moved from\r\nunder you and you were left standing in space alone so that you could\r\nsee in every direction, you would find that the band formed a complete\r\nring round the sky.\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye the Milky Way seems to be made up of mists of matter\r\nas thin as the stuff of which comets’ tails are made. There are some\r\npatches, though, that are very bright, but look at them as long as you\r\nwill with the naked eye nothing more can be seen than just a milky\r\npatch of hazy white, as shown in Fig. 133.\r\n\r\nWith a very small telescope, however, this band of luminous matter\r\nwill be instantly changed into thousands of stars, all separate and\r\ndistinct, and some of these stars will look about as large as the stars\r\nof the Pleiades when these are seen with the naked eye, while others\r\nwill shine as brightly as Venus or Jupiter when they are nearest to the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nThese bright patches, then, which form the Milky Way, are really\r\ngroups of stars or star-clusters, and when some of these clusters are\r\nphotographed through a telescope as many as 15 or 20 thousand stars can\r\nbe counted, while the real number of stars that lie beyond and which\r\ncannot be seen is past all calculation, and, just think of it, every\r\none of these stars is a Sun as large or larger than our Sun!\r\n\r\nThose who have made a deep study of starcraft tell us that our Sun is\r\none of the stars of the Milky Way, and since the other fixed star that\r\nis nearest to us, which is _Alpha Centauri_, is 25 trillion miles away,\r\nand Sirius, the Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the whole sky,\r\nis three times as far away as Alpha Centauri, we may gain some slight\r\nidea of the enormous distances of the fainter stars that make up the\r\nMilky Way.\r\n\r\n=The Nebulæ.=—Unlike the bright, cloud-like patches in the Milky Way,\r\nand which the telescope shows to be formed of separate and distinct\r\nstars, are the faint misty spots in the sky called _nebulæ_ (or nebule).\r\n\r\nNow the nebulæ give us a clew as to how the stars were made, and how\r\nother stars are now being made, for it is believed that the nebulæ are\r\nthe raw material which, when set in motion, produced heat and took on\r\nform and became Suns and planets like our own solar system.\r\n\r\nThe nebulæ are formed of luminous gas. Some of them are great irregular\r\nclouds of gas, many are more or less spiral in form, others are\r\ncondensed so they look like fuzzy stars.\r\n\r\nThere are a few of these nebulæ which can be seen with the naked eye;\r\none of these is the _Great Nebula of Orion_, and if you will look at\r\nOrion some night and draw an imaginary line a little below his belt\r\nand toward the east you will be able to find it. Another nebula that\r\nis bright enough to be seen with the naked eye is the _Great Nebula in\r\nAndromeda_. Both of these nebulæ are good tests for eyesight. Fig. 134\r\nshows some of the different forms of nebulæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.—DIFFERENT FORMS OF NEBULÆ.]\r\n\r\n=The Making of the Stars.=—To explain how our Sun and the planets\r\nwere made, as well as all the other stars in the universe, two ideas\r\nhave been worked out, and although these are quite unlike in many\r\nways, yet both start out with the nebulæ. The first of these is called\r\nthe _nebular hypothesis_ and the other and later one is called the\r\n_planetesimal hypothesis_.\r\n\r\n=The Nebular Hypothesis.=—We have found out what _nebula_ is believed\r\nto be and we should next understand exactly what the word _hypothesis_\r\nmeans. An hypothesis is an idea worked out so that there is a fairly\r\ngood chance of its being true.\r\n\r\nThe _nebular hypothesis_, then, is an idea that has been worked out\r\nfrom what nebulæ are believed to be and what is known of the mighty\r\nforces of nature, and these when taken together seem to show that all\r\nthe things in the sky—stars, planets, moons, comets and meteors—are\r\nmade of nebular stuff.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis says that when the nebular matter, or star stuff\r\nof which the planets were made, was separated from the parent nebula\r\nby centrifugal force, they were all whirled away in the same plane,\r\nturning on their own axes and traveling round the Sun in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n=The Planetesimal Hypothesis.=—A later idea, is called the\r\n_planetesimal hypothesis_. _Planetesimal_ means little planet, and\r\nas we know already what hypothesis means, by coupling the two words\r\ntogether we may easily guess that it is an idea worked out which\r\naccounts for the making of solar systems out of little planets.\r\n\r\nThe planetesimal hypothesis assumes that the sun, planets, and moons\r\ncomprising the Solar System were formed from a star which was torn to\r\npieces by another star which passed close by. The star was left in\r\nthe form of a spiral nebula rather lumpy and with little particles of\r\nmatter scattered all around.\r\n\r\nThe meteors, or little planets, making up the nebula, attract each\r\nother, like all other bodies, and when they get close enough they are\r\ndrawn together and dense masses of matter, or cores, are built up.\r\nThe largest core is seen in the center of a spiral nebula, and as it\r\nbecomes more compact it grows hotter and a Sun is made, while the other\r\nand smaller cores turn round it and attract little planets to them. And\r\nso the cores grow in size, and with more and more weight bearing toward\r\ntheir centers the gases are forced out and these make the air and water.\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner that the planetesimal hypothesis explains how the\r\nSun, planets and Moons of the solar system are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSEEING THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\n=How the Stars Shine.=—A burning match, a candle, an oil or gas flame,\r\nthe Sun, comets and meteors all give out light and heat in exactly the\r\nsame way, but the heat and light are made differently.\r\n\r\nWhen you strike a match the friction makes enough heat to light the\r\nchemicals of which the head is formed and the burning gases light the\r\nsplint which in turn generates more gases from the wood and these give\r\nout more light and heat.\r\n\r\nWhen you light a candle the heat melts the wax which is then drawn up\r\nthe wick, the burning gas around the wick produces more gas and the\r\ngas keeps the flame going. In the case of an oil lamp the oil, which\r\nis already a fluid, is drawn up by the wick, where it is changed into\r\ngases, and light and heat result as in the candle. The oil lamp is,\r\nthen, a step ahead of the candle, for the solid wax is replaced by the\r\nfluid oil.\r\n\r\nIn the gas light the gas, which is made of coal or other matter, is\r\nforced out of the jet under pressure and this gives a bigger and better\r\nflame than the oil lamp; and, as the oil lamp is better than the\r\ncandle, so the gas jet is an improvement over the oil lamp.\r\n\r\nNow the Sun, and this is also true of most of the stars, is so large\r\nand hot that if any solid matter, such as iron and other metals could\r\nbe thrown into the Sun they would not only be melted but instantly\r\nchanged into gases. Further, the Sun is so hot that the materials\r\ncannot combine with Oxygen—in other words they cannot burn. The\r\nintensely hot gases of the Sun radiate the light and heat and we\r\nsuppose that they keep themselves hot largely by contraction.\r\n\r\nWhen a comet comes close enough to the Earth to be seen it is then\r\nclose enough to the Sun so that the light and heat of the Sun cause\r\nsome of the gases of which the nucleus of the comet is formed, to\r\nbecome white hot; as a comet gets closer to the Sun the solid matter\r\nof the nucleus, such as sodium—which is a kind of salt—iron and other\r\nthings are changed into gases and these burn fiercely.\r\n\r\nWhile we can see the light of a comet we cannot feel its heat, for a\r\ncomet is too small to send its heat waves through such a great distance.\r\n\r\nJust as a match is lit by striking it, so meteors are set on fire by\r\nstriking the air. Meteors are made up of the same kind of matter as\r\ncomets and when these shooting stars come within the attraction of the\r\nEarth the friction caused by the meteor rubbing against the air is so\r\ngreat that an intense heat is produced and the gases burst into flame.\r\n\r\nIf a meteor is small it is entirely burned up before it reaches the\r\nEarth and all we see of it is a bright streak of light. If a meteor\r\nis large enough only the outside of it is burned and it will, in\r\nconsequence, reach the Earth, when it becomes, as explained in the last\r\nchapter, a meteorite.\r\n\r\nMeteors and meteorites produce a very bright light, burning as they do\r\nin the oxygen of our air, and though they are very close to us they are\r\nso small we cannot feel any heat sent out by them.\r\n\r\nWe have said that when a match is struck the friction produces heat and\r\nthat when the wax of a candle, the oil of a lamp or the gas of a jet\r\nis burned they produce light and heat, and this is also true of the\r\nblazing Sun, the fiery comets and the burning meteors.\r\n\r\nWhere there is light there is usually heat and turn about where there\r\nis heat there is light if the temperature is high enough. Heat is\r\nproduced before light, but the two are nearly always found together and\r\nthey are so much alike they might be called the Siamese twins.\r\n\r\n=What Heat and Light Are.=—We know that both heat and light are caused\r\nby burning gases, but let’s get a little closer and find out just how\r\nand why gases which are burning send out heat and light.\r\n\r\nNow gases are formed of particles of matter called _atoms_ and these\r\natoms are very small but they have a certain size and weight according\r\nto the substance they form. When these gases are cold the atoms are\r\ncomparatively quiet, but when they are heated to a high temperature\r\nthey are thrown into a violent state of motion and _vibrate_ to and fro\r\na given number of times per second, or _frequency_, as it is called,\r\naccording to the substances they are made of.\r\n\r\nThe next question in order is what makes the particles, or atoms move,\r\nor vibrate and the answer is _heat_, which sometimes produces burning.\r\nCombustion, or burning is a chemical action and can be explained by\r\nsaying that it is the combining of a substance with oxygen, or other\r\nsubstance with the production of heat and light.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between heat and light is that of _wave length_ as\r\nwe shall see presently, and the length of heat waves and of light waves\r\ndepends entirely on the rapidity with which the atoms vibrate, or the\r\n_frequency of vibration_, as it is called. If the atoms of gas move\r\nslowly heat is sent out and if the atoms move rapidly the heat grows\r\nmore intense and light is radiated.\r\n\r\nWhen the atoms of a burning gas vibrate just fast enough to produce\r\nlight the color of the light is red; when the atoms vibrate still\r\nfaster the color of the light is green and when the atoms vibrate very\r\nfast the light sent out is violet, so we see that not only do the\r\nvibrating atoms send out light but that the rapidity, or frequency with\r\nwhich they vibrate makes, or determines, the color as well of the light\r\nwhich is sent out.\r\n\r\nOne thing more: the rapidity of the motion, or vibration, of the atoms\r\nof a gas depends entirely on the substance which is being burned, so\r\nthat certain substances when burning always produce certain colors.\r\n(See Chapter XII, _What the Stars Are Made Of_.)\r\n\r\n=How Heat and Light Travel.=—While the little motions or vibrations,\r\nof the particles, or atoms, of gas forming the flame of a candle, the\r\nSun, and other heat and light givers could go on just the same we could\r\nnot feel their heat or see their light without something or some kind\r\nof a substance which would connect them with our bodies and our eyes,\r\nlike a wire connecting a push button with an electric bell. And there\r\n_is_ something which connects us with the most distant stars and that\r\nsomething is called the _ether_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.—RIPPLES OR WAVES ON WATER.]\r\n\r\nTo show how these little movements, or vibrations set up by the atoms\r\nof a flame impress us as heat or light do at a distance we will begin\r\nwith a simple experiment to show what the ether is and how it acts.\r\n\r\nIf you will stand on the edge of a pool of water and throw a stone\r\ninto the middle of it you will see a little ring-like ripple, or wave\r\nstart out from the point where the stone struck the water; this ripple,\r\nor water wave will continue to grow larger and larger in diameter and\r\nweaker and weaker until it reaches the edge of the pond, as shown in\r\nFig. 135, or if the pond is very large the waves will die out before\r\nthey reach the edge.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you toss a number of stones into the middle of the pond one\r\nafter another a series of ring-like waves will follow from the center\r\nof the pond where the stones strike the water to the edge of the pond,\r\nor until they die out.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner if a bell is struck by a blow of its tongue,\r\nripples, or waves in the air will be sent out all around the bell.\r\nThese waves in the air are called _sound waves_, but they are, after\r\nall, only _air waves_.\r\n\r\nWhen a bell is struck the rim of the bell moves forth and back, first\r\nin one direction and then in the other, as shown in the diagram, Fig.\r\n136, and we call these little movements of the bell _vibrations_. The\r\nmovements are so small that you cannot see them, but if you put your\r\nfinger on the bell you can feel them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vibrations of a bell are very small they are powerful\r\nenough to set up ripples, or waves in the air as shown in Fig. 137,\r\nand when these air waves or sound waves strike the drum of the ear it\r\nvibrates just like the bell and the _auditory nerve_ of the ear carries\r\nthe waves on to the brain and we hear the bell ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.—VIBRATION OF A BELL.]\r\n\r\nIt must be plain now that if there was no air connecting the bell with\r\nour ears the bell might keep on ringing and yet we could not hear it.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is set in motion by the vibrations of a bell, or any other\r\ndevice for producing from 32 to 40,000 vibrations per second, we can\r\nhear it, and when the air moves as a mass, as when the wind blows, we\r\ncan feel it. Air forms a layer around the Earth that is between 200 and\r\n300 miles thick, but out in the great space beyond there is no air.\r\nYet the space is not empty, but it is filled instead with a substance\r\ncalled the ether.\r\n\r\nJust as the air is finer than water so the ether is a million times\r\nfiner than the air. It is so fine that it fills up all the little\r\nspaces between the particles or atoms of water and of the air, and it\r\npenetrates in between the atoms of the densest metals and the hardest\r\nglass, and further, and still more wonderful, it fills all of the great\r\nspace in which the planets and the stars are placed.\r\n\r\nNow when the particles, or atoms of gas are set in motion, or vibration\r\nby a flame of any kind, be it a candle or the Sun, little ripples or\r\nwaves are started in the ether and if these waves are very short they\r\naffect the eye and cause the _optic nerve_ to vibrate exactly like the\r\nvibrations which are sending out the ether waves and these waves are\r\ncarried to our brains and we _see_ the light. The way in which a flame\r\nsends out waves in the ether and is received by the eye, is shown in\r\nFig. 138.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.—SOUND WAVES IN THE AIR SET UP BY BELL.]\r\n\r\nIt takes a ripple, or wave on the water started by the impact of a\r\nstone about one-half second to travel one foot. A sound wave, set up\r\nby the vibrations of a bell, or other sound producing device, travels\r\nthrough the air at the rate of 1,090 feet per second, while light and\r\nheat waves set up by the vibrations of a flame, the Sun or other hot\r\nbody, travel through the ether at the rate of 186,500 miles per second.\r\n\r\nIt must be plain now that if there was no ether connecting the flame,\r\nor the Sun with our eyes the flame, or Sun might continue to send out\r\nlight and yet we could not see it.\r\n\r\n=How the Eye Sees.=—If it was not for our ears we could not hear a bell\r\nring nor any sound, for though the waves in the air might still be sent\r\nout we would have no means of receiving them; again if it was not for\r\nour eyes we could not see a flame, the Sun or any other source of light\r\nand, what would be worse, we could not see an object by its reflected\r\nlight, for though the waves in the ether would still be sent out we\r\nwould have no means of receiving them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.—WAVES IN THE ETHER.]\r\n\r\nThe eye is simply a camera on a very small scale, but what it lacks\r\nin size it makes up by the excellence of its operation. If you will\r\nset up a sheet of white cardboard on one end of your starboard, place\r\na lighted candle at the other end and then hold your burning glass\r\nbetween the flame of the candle and the cardboard, as shown in Fig.\r\n139, and do all this in an otherwise dark room, you will see a picture\r\nturned upside down, called an _inverted image_, of the candle flame on\r\nthe cardboard.\r\n\r\nTo get a sharp picture, or image of the flame on the cardboard screen\r\nyou will have to move the lens toward and away from the cardboard, and\r\nthis process is called focusing. If you will fix the lens in the front\r\nof a light-tight box and place a sheet of ground glass in the back of\r\nthe box you will have a simple, though crude, camera.\r\n\r\nThe eye has all of the things which the highest priced camera has and a\r\ngood deal more, for all of its adjustments are automatically made, and\r\nyou don’t even have to think about them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.—FORMING AN IMAGE WITH A LENS.]\r\n\r\nThe eye is almost as round as a ball and it can be turned a little in\r\nits bony socket in any direction. The outer part of an eye which takes\r\nthe place of the box of a camera, is stretched round the whole eye like\r\nthe cover of a baseball, as shown in Fig. 140. The front part of this\r\ncover forms the white of the eye, and fitting into the cover and over\r\nthe lens, like a watch crystal in its rim, is the _cornea_, which is a\r\ntough, but transparent film and protects the _iris_ and the _lens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.—THE HUMAN EYE.]\r\n\r\nBetween the lens and the cornea is a thin disk, or diaphragm with a\r\nhole in its center and this is the iris; the purpose of the iris is to\r\nlet in only a certain amount of light, just like the shutter of a good\r\ncamera. The hole in the iris forms the _pupil_ of the eye, and you can\r\nsee the hole, or pupil, grow larger or smaller, just as the eye needs\r\nmore or less light.\r\n\r\nThe lining of the eye is called the _retina_ and this forms a screen at\r\nthe back of the eye on which the light waves in the ether project the\r\nimage of the object at which the eye is looking. Instead of being white\r\nlike our cardboard screen the retina is very black.\r\n\r\nThe retina upon which the image is formed is connected with the optic\r\nnerve; in fact, the retina is a part of the optic nerve and is covered\r\nwith a lot of little nerve ends or filaments called _rods_ and _cones_.\r\n\r\nNow when the waves in the ether sent out by the flame of a candle, or\r\nby the Sun, reach the eye, they pass through the cornea, then through\r\nthe pupil, or hole in the iris, and finally through the lens which\r\nfocuses the waves on the retina and forms the image there.\r\n\r\nThe different colors of light are caused by waves in the ether of\r\ndifferent lengths; when very short waves strike the retina we say the\r\ncolor is violet; waves a little longer we call green and the longest\r\nwaves which the eye can see form in our brains the sensation of red.\r\n\r\nWaves in the ether which are longer than the wave-lengths the eye can\r\nsee produce heat and when these waves fall on any part of the body the\r\nnerves detect them and we call the sensation heat. On the other hand\r\nwaves in the ether which are too short to affect the nerves of the eye\r\nwill impress a photographic plate.\r\n\r\nThe iris of the eye acts as a self-regulating shutter, which makes the\r\nhole, or pupil in front of the lens larger or smaller according to the\r\namount of light which is needed to see an object well. If the light\r\nis strong the iris contracts, which means that the hole gets smaller\r\nand so cuts off some of the light. If the light is weak the hole gets\r\nlarger and we say the pupil expands and this lets more light through\r\nthe lens.\r\n\r\nThere must also be some means of adjustment to make a sharp image, or\r\npicture, on the retina, however near or far away the object may be from\r\nthe eye. In a camera this is done by moving the lens and the screen\r\ncloser together or farther apart and this is the purpose of the bellows\r\nof a camera.\r\n\r\nBut the eye has a much finer and quicker adjustment than this for\r\ndistance. The lens is so made that the front part of it can bend just\r\nas the distance changes. You have only to look at an object and the\r\nlens is adjusted without the slightest effort or knowledge on your part.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder how light waves can pass through a substance as solid\r\nand as hard as glass or through the eye. You will remember I told you\r\nin the beginning of this chapter how ether got into every little space,\r\neven in metals and glass, as well as that it filled all the great space\r\nbetween the stars.\r\n\r\nWe think of glass as being very solid, and it is solid enough to keep\r\nwater or air in a bottle from getting out through its pores. But glass\r\nand the substance of which the eye is made are just about as full of\r\nholes as a sieve, but the holes are so very, very small you couldn’t\r\nbegin to see them even with the aid of a high-power microscope, yet\r\nthey are large enough for the ether to run through just as water runs\r\nthrough a sieve.\r\n\r\nWhen I tell you that waves in the ether which are sent out by the\r\nlight of a candle or the Sun are only about 15 ten-millionths to 30\r\nten-millionths of an inch in length, and that the holes, or pores, in\r\nthe glass and the cornea and lens of the eye, and which are full of\r\nether, are much larger, you can readily understand that the ether waves\r\nwhich we call light can merrily pass through either glass or the eye\r\nand that there is nothing in the way to stop them.\r\n\r\nTo sum up briefly how the stars shine, how light travels and how the\r\neye sees we will start with the light of the Sun and say\r\n\r\n(1) That the Sun is made up largely of gases, and that (2) These gases\r\nare formed of various substances, and that (3) The gases produce\r\nterrific heat, which means that (4) The atoms or particles which form\r\nthe gases are in violent motion or vibration. (5) These vibrations\r\nstart out waves in the ether which travel out into space at a speed\r\nof about 186,500 miles per second. (6) On reaching the eye the waves\r\npass through the lens and form a picture or image (7) On the retina, or\r\nscreen of the eye, which is made up of the ends of nerves, and these\r\nvibrate just as the atoms of the gases in the Sun which sent out the\r\nwaves vibrated, and finally (8) These nerve vibrations are sent over\r\nthe optic nerve to the brain, where they take on the shape, size and\r\ncolors of the Sun.\r\n\r\n=Reflection of Light.=—The flame of a match, or a candle, an oil or\r\na gas lamp, or Sun, comet or meteor, produces its own light, and for\r\nthis reason these bodies are called _self-luminous_—that is, they are\r\nthemselves the source of light.\r\n\r\nAll other objects which do not produce light, such as an apple, a\r\nstone, the Earth and other planets and moons are called _non-luminous\r\nbodies_.\r\n\r\nYet these non-luminous bodies can send out light if they are lighted\r\nup by some self-luminous body. It is well that this is so, or else we\r\ncould never see anything that was not in itself giving out light.\r\n\r\nIf you will hold an apple or a stone in your hand and let the light of\r\na candle or the Sun fall on it you will be able to see the apple or\r\nstone, and, although you will hardly be able to notice it, you will see\r\nthem by the light which strikes them and is turned back, or _reflected_\r\nfrom their surfaces, as shown in Fig. 141.\r\n\r\nIf a rubber ball is thrown on the sidewalk it will bounce back and\r\nthis is just the way light acts when it strikes most objects—it\r\nbounces back, or, to use the right word, it is reflected.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the surface of the Earth by daylight we see the sand\r\nand stones, grass and trees, houses and other objects by the light\r\nwhich is reflected, or thrown back from the surface of these things by\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the surface of the Earth by the light of the Moon we\r\nalso see the objects by reflected light, but in this case the light\r\nis twice reflected, for moonlight is the light of the Sun falling on\r\nthe Moon and which is then reflected to the Earth, where it is again\r\nreflected to our eyes from the objects it falls on. This is the reason\r\nmoonlight is so pale when compared with sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.—LIGHT REFLECTED BY AN APPLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.—LIGHT REFRACTED. SPOON IN GLASS OF WATER.]\r\n\r\n=Refraction of Light.=—When a beam of light passes through glass, water\r\nand other transparent substances, and is bent out of a straight line it\r\nis said to be _refracted_.\r\n\r\nPlace a spoon in a glass of water, as shown in Fig. 142 and it will\r\nlook as if the spoon is broken in two at the point where it touches the\r\nwater. The bending of the beam of light will be more clearly understood\r\nfrom the drawing in Fig. 143.\r\n\r\nIf you will look at a star squarely through a thick piece of glass and\r\nthe star seems to change its position a little you will know that the\r\nsides of the glass are not quite parallel.\r\n\r\nA _prism_ is a three-sided piece of glass, if we except the ends, as\r\nshown in Fig. 144. When a beam of light passes through a prism the\r\nprism affects the light in two ways: first, it bends the beam, and\r\nsecond, it separates the ether waves, or light waves, as they are\r\ncalled, according to their lengths, and as color depends on the length\r\nof the waves in the ether a prism will show the different colors on a\r\nscreen and this is called the _spectrum_. It is shown in Fig. 145.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.—HOW LIGHT IS REFRACTED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.—PRISM.]\r\n\r\nLenses are pieces of glass having curved surfaces. When a beam of light\r\npasses through a lens it is also bent out of its original direction, or\r\nrefracted.\r\n\r\nA _convex lens_, see Fig. 146, is a lens which is thicker in the\r\nmiddle than it is at the edges. A convex lens is used for magnifying\r\nan object; or for forming an image so that it can be magnified by\r\nanother lens as in a telescope, for forming an image on the screen of a\r\ncamera, and for bringing the heat waves of the Sun to a focus, as with\r\na burning glass.\r\n\r\nThe point where the rays of light are brought together is called the\r\n_focus_. You can easily find the focus of a lens by holding a sheet of\r\npaper, or the hand under the lens and letting the sunlight pass through\r\nit; where the spot of light is smallest and brightest there is the\r\nfocus. The distance of this point from the lens is called the _focal\r\nlength_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.—PRISM FORMING A SPECTRUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.—CONVEX LENS.]\r\n\r\nA _concave lens_ is a lens which is thinner at the middle than it is\r\nat the edge, as shown in Fig. 147. It is used in small telescopes and\r\nopera glasses to turn the inverted picture formed by the convex lens\r\naround so that the object can be seen in its right position, as shown\r\nin Fig. 151.\r\n\r\n=Shadows.=—_Shadows_ are useful as well as sunshine, but shadows are\r\nsuch common, everyday things it seems almost useless to talk about\r\nthem; still you may or may not know that there are different kinds of\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.—CONCAVE LENS.]\r\n\r\nOf course we all know that when a candle or a gaslight or the Sun\r\nshines on an apple or any other _opaque_ object—that is, an object that\r\nwill not let the ether waves go through it—the light is cut off back of\r\nit and this dark space is called a shadow; this is also true when the\r\nSun shines on the Earth, or on any of the other planets or their moons.\r\n\r\nThere are always two parts to the shadow of an object unless the light\r\nis a mere point or the object is very close to the screen, or surface\r\non which the shadow falls. The dark part of the shadow is called the\r\n_umbra_. The edge of the object where the light and shade run together\r\nand form a partial shadow is called the _penumbra_ and during a total\r\neclipse this partial shadow surrounds the dark shadow, or umbra of the\r\nEarth or Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SPYGLASS OR TELESCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Boy Who Discovered the Telescope.=—Spectacles have been made and\r\nused for nearly a thousand years and the art of making lenses is very\r\nmuch older.\r\n\r\nA little over three hundred years ago there lived in Amsterdam,\r\nHolland, a spectacle maker named Lipperhey, and it is said of him that\r\nhe made good lenses.\r\n\r\nThere was apprenticed to this lens grinder a Dutch boy, and I am sorry\r\nI cannot tell you his name, for he was a boy who did things; but his\r\nname is not recorded, which is a shame, for if it had not been for this\r\nboy Galileo might never have had a telescope.\r\n\r\nOne day while the boss was out this Dutch boy was standing before a\r\nwindow of the shop and he held a lens before his eye with one hand and\r\nanother lens before the first lens with his other hand, as shown in\r\nFig. 148. Imagine his surprise when the church he was looking at seemed\r\nto move much nearer to him, that is to say, the image of the church was\r\ngreatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe boy had made a wonderful discovery—he had discovered the\r\n_telescope_. When his master returned the boy showed him what he had\r\ndone and it was not long before the great Galileo had a telescope and\r\nwas startling the world by his wonderful discoveries of the moons of\r\nJupiter, the rings of Saturn, the phases of Venus, the spots on the Sun\r\nand a hundred other wonders of the sky.\r\n\r\nA telescope is an arrangement of lenses in a tube for making the image\r\nof a distant object larger on the retina of the eye, or, as in the case\r\nof the fixed stars, for making them brighter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.—LIPPERHEY’S BOY DISCOVERS THE TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe word telescope comes from two Greek words, the first, _tele_,\r\nwhich means afar, and the second, _scope_, which means to see, so that\r\ntelescope means just what we should expect it to mean and that is to\r\nsee afar.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of telescopes, but there are only two kinds\r\nI want to make clear to you here; in the first kind the eye sees the\r\nobject just as it is, that is, standing right side up, or _erect_. This\r\nkind of a telescope is called a _spyglass_, and is used to look at\r\nobjects on the surface of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the second kind of telescope the eye sees the object upside down,\r\nor _inverted_, and this kind of telescope, which is called an\r\n_astronomical telescope_, is just as good as the other for looking at\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\n=A Pinhole Telescope.=—Before describing how to make and use real\r\ntelescopes which have lenses I want to tell you of a little scheme to\r\nsee afar, and though it does not magnify the image of the object that\r\nis seen through it, yet it aids the naked eye when you are looking at\r\nthe Sun and Stars.\r\n\r\nTo make a pinhole telescope get a pasteboard tube about 1¼ inches in\r\ndiameter and 5 or 6 inches long. A paper tube for mailing papers and\r\nsheet music is just the thing and can be bought at any stationery store.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.—DISK OF CARDBOARD FOR PINHOLE TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.—CROSS SECTION OF PINHOLE TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nCut out a _disk_, or circular piece of cardboard just large enough to\r\nfit the tube, see Fig. 149, and push a pin point or needle through the\r\ncenter to make a small, clean hole. Next, glue this cardboard disk in\r\nthe tube ½ an inch from one end. The disk must be glued in the tube so\r\nthat no light can leak around the edge.\r\n\r\nIf, now, you look at the Sun through the pinhole telescope, as shown\r\nin Fig. 150, you will get a better view of it than if you look at it\r\nthrough a pinhole in the cardboard alone, for the tube shuts out all\r\nthe other rays of light from the eye.\r\n\r\nTo improve the seeing qualities of the pinhole telescope make the hole\r\nin the cardboard disk ¼ inch in diameter and cover this hole with a bit\r\nof tinfoil. Now make a hole in the center of the tinfoil with the point\r\nof a needle; this makes the edge of the hole sharp.\r\n\r\nA pasteboard tube without the pinhole will also aid the naked eye in\r\nseeing the Moon and stars, for it shuts out all the rays of light\r\naround the eye and limits the sight to a certain part of the sky;\r\ntogether these things are very good helps in observing especially if\r\nthere are gas and electric lights nearby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.—THE TELESCOPE (GALILEO).]\r\n\r\n=How a Telescope Works.=—A real telescope has at least two lenses in\r\nit; the larger lens is placed in the end of the tube nearest the object\r\nto be viewed and is called the _object glass_ because the light from\r\nthe object is received by it.\r\n\r\nThe smaller lens is placed in the end of the tube nearest the eye,\r\nand is called the _eyepiece_, for it is this lens which enlarges, or\r\nmagnifies the image of the object that is thrown upon the retina of the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThere are two simple kinds of telescopes; the first is the kind that\r\nGalileo used for making his great discoveries. The kind of lenses used\r\nand the way they are placed in the tube is shown in Fig. 151.\r\n\r\nIn this telescope the object glass is a double convex lens and the beam\r\nof light which strikes it is brought to a point as in the case of a\r\nburning glass, but before the light reaches this point it is caught up\r\nby the double concave lens which forms the eyepiece, when it is carried\r\nto the eye in an erect position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.—OPERA GLASSES.]\r\n\r\nAn opera glass is simply a pair of these little telescopes, joined\r\ntogether so that they can be focused at the same time by means of an\r\nadjusting screw, as shown in Fig. 152.\r\n\r\nAnother simple telescope is formed of two double convex lenses. As\r\nin the telescope just described the larger lens, or object glass, is\r\nplaced in the end of the tube nearest the object to be viewed and the\r\nsmaller lens, or eyepiece, is placed in the tube nearest the eye.\r\n\r\nIn this telescope, though, the eyepiece is a double convex lens and\r\nwhile a larger image is formed in the eye it is inverted, or upside\r\ndown, so that this kind of a telescope is of no use as a glass to spy\r\nthings with on the surface of the Earth.\r\n\r\n=How to Make a Cheap Telescope.=—Lenses are absurdly cheap. If you live\r\nin a large city you will find lens grinders who will sell you the kind\r\nof lenses you need for either kind of telescope for a dollar or so.\r\n\r\n=Telescope No. 1.=—This telescope is fashioned after an opera glass,\r\nthat is, it has a concave lens for an eyepiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.—PASTEBOARD MOUNTING OF LENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.—PASTEBOARD LENS MOUNTING.]\r\n\r\nGet two pasteboard tubes of the kind described for the pinhole\r\ntelescope; the bore, or hole, of the first tube should be 1¾ inches in\r\ndiameter and it should be 2 inches long. Have the second tube a little\r\nsmaller than 1¾ inches in diameter on the outside so that it will slide\r\neasily into the larger tube and yet not leak light, and have this tube\r\n1½ inches long. Paint the inside of both tubes with black paint to keep\r\nthe walls of the tube from reflecting any stray rays of light which may\r\nstrike them. The outside of both tubes can be covered with bookbinders’\r\ncloth to give them a neat appearance.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to mount the lenses. The larger lens for the object\r\nglass is a double convex lens 1½ inches in diameter and having a\r\n4-inch focal length, or _focus_, as it is called for short. A lens of\r\nthis kind can be bought for 25 or 30 cents. The smaller lens for the\r\neyepiece is a double concave lens 1 inch in diameter and having a focus\r\nof 2 inches. This lens can be had for about 40 cents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.—OPERA GLASS TELESCOPE. CROSS SECTION.]\r\n\r\nCut a strip of thin, tough cardboard ½ inch wide and 6 inches long; on\r\nthis strip glue a strip of heavy pasteboard ½ inch wide and 5⅜ inches\r\nlong, and have one end of both pieces even, as shown in Fig. 153. Set\r\na flatiron on the pieces and let them dry. When dry make a groove down\r\nthe middle of the heavy pasteboard by slicing out a very thin strip\r\nwith the point of a sharp knife, being careful not to cut through the\r\nthin cardboard. Now bend the strips around the lens with the lens in\r\nthe groove, glue over the thin end as shown in Fig. 154, and slip a a\r\nrubber band or tie a string around it to hold it in position until it\r\nhas dried.\r\n\r\nThe small concave lens, or eyepiece, is mounted in the same way, but\r\nsince the lens is only 1 inch in diameter, cut the strip of cardboard ½\r\ninch wide and 4¼ inches long and the strip of thick pasteboard ½ inch\r\nwide and 3½ inches long; this done glue them together, cut the groove\r\nand mount the lens as before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.—TELESCOPE. CROSS SECTION VIEW.]\r\n\r\nThe next and last thing is to smear glue on the cardboard mounts and\r\npush the convex lens in the end of the large tube and the concave lens\r\nin the end of the small tube. Now slide the tubes together and you will\r\nhave as good a telescope as the boy who invented it. It is shown in\r\ncross section in Fig. 155.\r\n\r\nYou should, however, make two caps, one for each end of the telescope\r\nto cover the lenses when not in use. This little telescope is very\r\nhandy to carry along on your scouting trips, as it takes up so little\r\nroom, being only 2 inches long when closed up.\r\n\r\n=Telescope No. 2.=—This telescope is very much better than the one just\r\ndescribed for seeing the stars as it magnifies about 4 times.\r\n\r\nIt is made exactly like the first one except that the larger tube is 14\r\ninches long and the smaller tube is 5 inches long. In this telescope\r\nboth lenses are double convex, the large one, or object glass, having\r\na diameter of 1½ inches and a focal length of 12 inches, while the\r\nsmaller lens, or eyepiece, has a diameter of 1 inch and a focal length\r\nof 3 inches. It is shown in cross section in Fig. 156. A spyglass\r\nusually has four or five _plano-convex lenses_ in it and these not only\r\nmagnify the image but they also erect it so that you see the object as\r\nit really is.\r\n\r\nWhile the homemade telescopes which I have described will not magnify\r\nas highly as a cheap telescope which you can buy, yet you ought to make\r\none, for it will let you into the secret of combining lenses, and this\r\nis as interesting as seeing the stars. By all means make your first\r\ntelescope and then if you want a better one buy it and get one as large\r\nas you can afford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.—MAGNIFYING POWER OF TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\n=To Find the Power of a Telescope.=—In the last chapter, I explained\r\nwhat the _focal length_ of a convex lens is, see Fig. 146, and how to\r\nmeasure it. To repeat, it is the distance in inches between the center\r\nof a lens and the point where the rays come together.\r\n\r\nYou can find exactly what the _magnifying power_ of your telescope is,\r\nwhen both lenses are convex, by dividing the focal length of the object\r\nglass by the focal length of the eyepiece, or lens.\r\n\r\nFor instance, suppose the focal length of the convex object glass of\r\nyour telescope is 12 inches and the focal length of the convex eye lens\r\nis 3 inches, then 12 ÷ 3 = 4 and the quotient 4 is the magnifying power\r\nof your telescope.\r\n\r\nTo find the focal length of a concave lens is a little harder, but\r\nGarrett P. Serviss tells us in his good little book on _Astronomy with\r\nan Opera Glass_ of an easy way to judge the magnifying power of an\r\nopera glass and it is just the same for a telescope. Look at a brick\r\nwall through one of the tubes with one eye while the other naked eye\r\nsees the wall direct.\r\n\r\nNow notice how many bricks which the naked eye can see, are needed to\r\nequal the thickness of one brick as seen through the glass. The number\r\nof bricks seen with the naked eye represents the magnifying power of\r\nthe glass. Fig. 157 shows how the bricks are compared.\r\n\r\n=The Stars Seen Through a Spyglass.—The Moon.=—When Galileo lived the\r\npeople believed that the Moon was a ball as smooth and bright as a\r\nglass marble and they also thought that the dark spots on its surface\r\nwere the continents of our Earth reflected by it.\r\n\r\nSo the first thing Galileo did when he got his telescope was to turn it\r\non the Moon, for he wanted to know about these dark spots, and you can\r\nimagine his surprise and delight to find that they were really great\r\nmountains and extinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\nYou cannot do better than to point your little homemade telescope at\r\nthe Moon, stop, look and rediscover the mountains on it and be as\r\nsurprised and delighted as Galileo was, three hundred years ago. To see\r\nthe mountains at their best do not wait until the Moon is full, for the\r\nsunlight then shines directly on top of the mountains and there are no\r\nshadows to help the eye to gauge breadths and heights.\r\n\r\nThe best time to see the mountains is when the Moon is in its first\r\nor its last quarter, for then they are well brought out by the bright\r\nsunlight shining on them from the side and the black shadows which they\r\ncast on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe great smooth stretches seen on the Moon are called seas. It may be\r\nthat in the long ago they were really seas, but it is more likely that\r\nGalileo and the early observers whose telescopes were little better\r\nthan yours thought they were seas. Then there are huge cracks or gorges\r\non the surface of the Moon, which start from some of the craters and\r\nrun for hundreds of miles in every direction. A number of these gorges\r\nstart from a volcano named _Tycho_ (pronounced Ti´-co) and make the\r\nMoon look as if it is cracked; and it is likely that when the Moon\r\ncooled down from its melted state after having been shot off from the\r\nEarth it did crack in many places. Fig. 158, which is a good telescopic\r\nview of the Moon, shows some of these great cracks radiating from Tycho.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.—FULL VIEW OF MOON.]\r\n\r\nTo show on a small scale how the Moon cracked on cooling down Nysmith\r\nfilled a glass globe with cold water and then sealing the globe he\r\nplunged it into hot water. The slow expansion of the cold water by\r\nthe hot water caused the globe to crack as shown in Fig. 159, and by\r\ncomparing the pictures it will be seen that the cracks on the Moon and\r\nin the glass globe are very much alike.\r\n\r\nThere is a mountain called Aristarchus[1] (pronounced Ar-is-tar´-cus)\r\nwhich is believed to be formed of pure metal because it shines brighter\r\nthan any other mountain on the Moon. Its position is shown on the map,\r\nFig. 160.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.—GLASS GLOBE CRACKED.]\r\n\r\nThe instant you look through your glass at the Moon the man which\r\nshows so plainly to the naked eye vanishes like a coin in a magician’s\r\nfingers and instead you will see a new world covered with plains and\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nBut if you will look at the Moon when it is nine or more days old, you\r\nwill see with the aid of your glass and a little imagination the Moon\r\ngirl, as shown in Fig. 161. You should have no trouble in finding her,\r\nfor the _Apennines_ form her crown while Tycho shines upon her breast\r\nlike a great yellow diamond.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Aristarchus was a Greek who lived 200 years before Christ.\r\nHe taught that the earth was round.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.—MAP OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.—THE MOON GIRL.]\r\n\r\nThere is another crater mountain which you should by all means know\r\nand that is Copernicus[2] (pronounced Ko-per´-ni-kus). Look through\r\nyour glass at the southeastern end of the Apennines and you will see a\r\ncrater that is larger in diameter than Tycho, though it is not so deep.\r\nTycho, Copernicus and the Apennines will serve you well as landmarks if\r\nyou follow up the explorations of the Moon which you have so well begun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Copernicus—Polish, astronomer. Born 1473. Before his time\r\nit was believed that the Sun, Moon and stars revolved round the Earth.\r\nCopernicus showed that the Earth was a planet and, with the others,\r\nthat it revolved round the Sun.]\r\n\r\n=The Sun.=—You can see the spots on the Sun quite well with your glass,\r\nand sunspots are always interesting.\r\n\r\nDo not try to look at the Sun through your glass without covering the\r\neyepiece either with a thickly smoked or dark-colored glass. You must\r\nalso use smoked or colored glasses over your eyepiece when you are\r\nlooking at an eclipse of the Sun.\r\n\r\nYou should look for sunspots this year, 1920, for they are decreasing\r\nin number and size and in a few years there will be scarcely any. After\r\nthat there will be more of them again.\r\n\r\n=The Planets.=—After you have seen the mountains on the Moon and the\r\nspots on the Sun you should next turn your glass on the planets.\r\n\r\nWhile you will probably say that the planets loom up very small—the\r\nlargest, Jupiter, appearing about the size of the head of a large\r\npin—yet they are wonderful to look at even through the smallest\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n=Mercury.=—This is a planet not easy to see even with the aid of a\r\nglass so if you see it you can think that you are lucky or skillful or\r\nperhaps a little of both.\r\n\r\n=Venus.=—Venus can be seen very much better with your small glass than\r\nMercury, but you will only be able to see it as a little disk and not\r\nas a crescent for your glass is of too low a magnifying power. It is a\r\nbrilliant object though even through the smallest glass.\r\n\r\n=Mars.=—While you cannot see the canals of Mars with your glass you can\r\nsee it as a bright disk of light and this is well worth while. Mars is\r\nbelieved to be peopled and the thought that it may be makes it a mighty\r\ninteresting object to look at. Look at it through your glass and think\r\nit over.\r\n\r\n=Jupiter.=—On account of his great size you will be able to see Jupiter\r\nbetter than any of the other planets. His disk will show clear and\r\ndistinct and if you have good eyesight and your glass is fairly good\r\nyou will be able to see one and perhaps two of his nine moons which\r\nwill appear as little points of light close to the planet.\r\n\r\n=Saturn.=—The rings of Saturn cannot be seen with a glass magnifying\r\nless than four times. His rings are at this writing (1915) in the best\r\nposition to be seen as the flat side of the rings is toward us now. In\r\n1921 the edge of his rings will be in a line with the Earth and then it\r\nwill be very hard to see them even with a much larger telescope.\r\n\r\n=Uranus.=—Although Uranus is so very far away, it can be seen with your\r\nglass, though you may not be able to see it as a disk of light.\r\n\r\nYou can tell when you have found Uranus by watching it for a few\r\nnights. If it changes its position among the stars around it you will\r\nknow you are looking at Uranus.\r\n\r\n=Neptune.=—Neptune is farther away than Uranus and your glass will show\r\nit as a mere point of light. Like Uranus you will know it if you see\r\nit, by its motion among the stars.\r\n\r\n=The Stars.=—After you have looked at the Sun, Moon, and planets to\r\nyour hearts’ content turn your glass on the Big Dipper and you will see\r\nabout ten times as many stars as you can see with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n_The Big Dipper_ is full of starry surprises as you will find to your\r\npleasure on looking at it with your glass: for instance, instead of the\r\nhandle being formed of three stars, it blazes with dozens of them.\r\n\r\nTake a look at Alcor, which is the middle star in the handle of the\r\nDipper. You may remember I told you in the first chapter that it had\r\na little companion, Mizar, which only sharp eyes can see. Now look at\r\nAlcor through your glass and you will see that it and Mizar are quite\r\nwidely separated.\r\n\r\nThe North Star is also a double star as these twin stars are called.\r\nJust as Mizar is a good test for the naked eye so the twin of the North\r\nStar is a good object on which you can try out the seeing power of your\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAnother double star which some boys can separate with their keen naked\r\neyes is _Epsilon_, named after one of the Greek letters (See Appendix\r\nC). This star together with Vega, a very bright and beautiful blue star\r\nof the first magnitude, and Zeta, another Greek letter star, form a\r\n_triangle_, which is the constellation of Lyra.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you can separate Epsilon into two stars with the naked\r\neye, you will see them stand out separate and distinct through your\r\nglass. If you had a more powerful glass you would see that each of the\r\nstars of Epsilon has a faint companion star, so that it is really a\r\n_quadruple star_, that is, there are four stars right together.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Milky Way, always a wonderful sight to the naked eye,\r\nbut still more wonderful when viewed through a glass however small;\r\nthere are the stars of the Pleiades of which the eye sees not more than\r\nsix or seven without help, but which bursts forth like a skyrocket into\r\na cluster of many-colored lights when seen through a glass; these are\r\nonly a few of the hundreds of other things which you can see in the sky\r\nwith the help of your little telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TIME O’ DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n=What Time Is It?=—This is a question everybody is always asking\r\neverybody else.\r\n\r\nDid you ever stop to think what a curious thing _time_ is? No one knows\r\nwhen it began nor can anyone tell when it will end, yet we measure off\r\na little bit from that which has gone or from that which is yet to\r\ncome, so that we may know when to eat, to start to work, or to quit,\r\nand when to go to bed or to get up.\r\n\r\nWe know that, roughly, a year is the time it takes the four seasons to\r\ncome and go, and that this is done when the Earth travels once round\r\nthe Sun; that the month is based on the time it takes the Moon to\r\ntravel once round the Earth; that the week has nothing to do with the\r\nSun, Earth, Moon or Stars, but is a pure invention, and, finally, that\r\nthe day is the time it takes the Earth to turn once round on its axis.\r\n\r\nBut when we want to know what time it is we mean, of course, what the\r\nhour, the minute and, sometimes, even the second of the day is, and\r\nthese are the small measured parts of time we want to find out about.\r\n\r\nThe time it takes the Earth to make one complete turn on its axis is\r\ndivided naturally into two parts, more or less equal, depending on\r\nwhere we live, and these parts are daytime and nighttime.\r\n\r\nThis general division of time, marked by alternate daylight and\r\ndarkness, may have served every need of the cave man at first, but just\r\nas he came to have sense enough to crawl into his cave to get out of\r\nthe rain so the blazing Sun must finally have driven into his awakening\r\nbrain its use to him as a means of marking time.\r\n\r\nAs his savage mind grew less animal and more human, ideas were formed\r\nin it either by instinct or by the first vague glimmerings of reason\r\nand he began to think. He saw that when the light of the Sun fell on\r\nthe trees and the rocks, long, strange, black marks, which we call\r\nshadows, were cast by them, and he must have noticed that the shadows\r\nswung round the trees and rocks in the opposite direction to the way\r\nthe Sun was traveling.\r\n\r\nTo mark off with his eye and place a stone at a point somewhere near\r\nthe middle of the shadow cast by the rising Sun and that cast by the\r\nsetting Sun, and which would mean that the day was half done was the\r\nnext great step.\r\n\r\nThese things were, quite likely, the first feeble efforts of the human\r\nrace to measure time, and out of which the sundial came, as well as the\r\ncrude beginnings on which the science of astronomy is based.\r\n\r\n=Solar Time, or Time by the Sun.=—To make a sundial which would give\r\ncorrect Sun time was so hard a problem that men had to think about it\r\nfor a million years before they could solve it and the chances are that\r\nthen it was invented by a boy. You will find directions for making a\r\nsimple sundial in Chapter III.\r\n\r\nNow let’s find out how we can know when a day begins and when it ends.\r\nOn first thought this would seem to be an easy thing to do and it is if\r\nwe are not particular about being exact. You will remember that a day\r\nis measured by the time it takes the Earth to turn once round on its\r\naxis and what we want to know, now, is how to tell when the Earth has\r\nmade one complete turn, no more and no less.\r\n\r\nWe can tell this, you may say, by a clock or a watch, but the best of\r\nclocks and watches are always a little fast or a little slow, and time\r\ntoday is measured by the fraction of a second. So we get the _apparent\r\ntime_ from the Sun, change it into _mean time_ and set our clocks and\r\nwatches by it.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways by which we can obtain Sun time, but all of them\r\nare based on the same principle. The way that was used by people who\r\nfirst began to think about these things, and it is also a good way for\r\nyou to try, is like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.—DIAGRAM SHOWING HOW TO FIND SOLAR NOON.]\r\n\r\nFirst you must have a good _horizon_, that is, you must be able to see\r\nthe Sun rise and set without any mountains or other things in the way.\r\n\r\nWhen you begin your observations for getting solar time note exactly\r\nwhere the Sun rises and where it sets on the horizon. You can easily do\r\nthis by using hills, houses and trees for marking the places. Now with\r\nyour eye draw a line between these two points.\r\n\r\nNotice also where you are standing and let your line of sight meet the\r\nimaginary line which joins the places where the Sun rises and sets just\r\nas near the middle as you can, and all of which is clearly shown in\r\nFig. 162. Now this line will run due north and south and hence it is a\r\n_meridian line_ which you are to use to observe the Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun reaches that point in the sky where it is directly over\r\nthe middle of the imaginary line, joining the places where it rises and\r\nsets, it is exactly noon, _Sun time_.\r\n\r\nThe next day observe the Sun in the same way and when it crosses the\r\nmeridian line again the Earth will have turned round once and you will\r\nhave a part of time measured off called a Sun or _solar day_.\r\n\r\nWhen the time is taken between two succeeding crossings of a meridian\r\nby the Sun a day so measured is called by astronomers an _apparent\r\nsolar day_, and when the Sun is on the meridian it is called _apparent\r\nnoon_.\r\n\r\nNow the word _apparent_ means to seem, that is, something which is\r\nobtained by observation. An apparent solar day is then the length of\r\na day measured by the Sun, and while we might suppose that the Sun at\r\nleast would always give a day of the same length, this is not the case\r\nfor the reason that the Earth does not travel in all parts of its orbit\r\nround the Sun at the same rate of speed, and, further, it is tilted on\r\nits axis; together these things make the days as measured off by the\r\nSun unequal and hence they are called apparent solar days.\r\n\r\n=Mean Solar Time.=—Apparent solar days which are of unequal length were\r\nall right as long as sundials were the only timepieces, but when clocks\r\nand watches came into use days which were equal in length were needed\r\nand needed badly, for a clock couldn’t be made which would keep Sun\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSo astronomers who watched the stars by night lay awake during the day\r\nwondering how they could make the Earth travel round the Sun at the\r\nsame speed every day in the year and just as though it was not tilted.\r\nAt last they solved the problem.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you think they did it? It was as easy as rolling off a\r\nlog—when you know how. They simply _imagined_ that the Earth traveled\r\nat a uniform speed and that it stood straight, as shown in Fig. 74.\r\nIn other words they took the _mean length_, which is another way of\r\nsaying the average length of all the apparent solar days which make up\r\na year, and divided it up equally. Further, the men who got up this\r\nscheme said that every day should have not only the same length, but\r\nthat it should have 24 hours, and of course you know that hours are\r\ndivided into minutes and minutes into seconds. _Mean solar time_, then,\r\nis really _imaginary Sun time_ and this is the time used everywhere and\r\nwatches and clocks are set by it.\r\n\r\n=Equation of Time.=—To get the exact mean time each day you have to\r\nknow just what the apparent solar time is, and then you have to know\r\nwhat the difference in time is between the apparent solar time and the\r\nmean time, that is how many minutes and seconds to add to or subtract\r\nfrom the solar time of each day to get the mean time.\r\n\r\nThis difference of time is called the _equation of time_. A table\r\nprepared by Professor Todd of the Amherst College Observatory is given\r\nin Appendix M and can be used for all ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n=Standard Time.=—A meridian, as you know, is an imaginary line running\r\ndue north and South and hence we can have a meridian whenever we want\r\nit and as many as we like.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun crosses the meridian of those who are on it, it is noon to\r\nthem, but to no one else, for the Sun has already crossed the meridians\r\nto the east of it and has yet to cross those to the west of it. When\r\nthe Sun crosses the meridian which passes through New York City it is\r\nnoon there and when the Sun crosses the meridians which pass through\r\nSt. Louis, Denver and San Francisco, it is noon at those places, and\r\nthis is true of every other place and of every other hour of the day.\r\nThis is the reason why every place had its own, or _local time_, before\r\nthe year of 1883.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration it takes the Sun about three hours to cross the\r\nUnited States from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\nNow as long as people traveled on foot, or by horse, they moved so\r\nslowly that local time did not worry them, but when railroads came into\r\nuse there was all kinds of trouble for the traveler; if he was going\r\nwest his watch was faster than the local time of the towns he passed\r\nthrough and if he was going east his watch was always slower than the\r\nlocal time. If he wanted the right time he had to set his watch at\r\nevery town he passed through; of course he couldn’t very well do this\r\nand he was always in a stew.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies were just as much put to for it was next to\r\nimpossible to make a timetable to fit the local time of each town and\r\nstill keep up a running schedule; and the result was that the railroads\r\nfinally got up a system of their own which they called _railroad time_.\r\nThis was all well enough for everybody but the poor traveler, who, not\r\nknowing the difference in time between local time and railroad time,\r\nnearly always found he was either an hour too early or—as it usually\r\nhappened—a minute or two too late to catch his train.\r\n\r\nAs new towns sprung up and railroads multiplied, things had come to\r\nsuch a pretty pass in 1883 that nobody but the astronomers knew what\r\nthe real time was, and they wouldn’t tell; then a new time scheme was\r\ntried out, and as it is still used we must conclude it is a fairly\r\ngood one. It is called the _zone_, or _belt system of standard time_;\r\nthe time used is called standard time because the towns and cities and\r\nrailroads all use it and there is no confusion.\r\n\r\nTo understand what _standard time_ means we have to know first what a\r\n_standard meridian_ is. A meridian, as we have said, is an imaginary\r\nline running due north and south anywhere we want it, but while a\r\nstandard meridian is also a line running due north and south it has a\r\nfixed position.\r\n\r\nThe first fixed or _prime meridian_, as it is called, passes through\r\n_Greenwich_ (pronounced Gren´-ij), which is a part of London, England.\r\nThe reason this meridian was chosen by geographers to reckon distance\r\neast and west from is because the Royal Observatory at Greenwich is one\r\nof the oldest in the world and it was the first from which exact time\r\nwas sent out.\r\n\r\nIf a circle is divided into 360 degrees, as shown in Fig. 163, and\r\nit is also divided into 24 parts, each part will be a space equal to\r\n15 degrees or 1 hour. Now geographers have divided the Earth into 24\r\nequal parts by meridians separated by 15 degrees, and each space, or\r\nbelt, between them represents 1 hour, as shown in Fig. 164. These fixed\r\nmeridians start at the first, or prime meridian, at Greenwich and all\r\nthe other meridians are measured in degrees east or west of Greenwich\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.—CIRCLE DIVIDED INTO 360 DEGREES AND 24 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nStarting west from the first, or prime meridian, which passes through\r\nGreenwich the time at the second standard meridian, which is called the\r\n15th meridian because it is 15 degrees from the first meridian, will be\r\none hour behind Greenwich time.\r\n\r\nAt every standard meridian the mean solar time is used as the standard\r\ntime and every place on it and halfway to the meridian on both sides\r\nuses it, and so local time and standard.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very convenient for the traveler, for instead of setting\r\nhis watch at each station he does not need to set it until he has\r\ntraveled 15 degrees east or west, which is about 700 miles in our\r\nnorthern latitudes, and then he turns it exactly one hour ahead or one\r\nhour back, depending on the direction he is going.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.—THE EARTH DIVIDED INTO 24 STANDARD MERIDIANS.]\r\n\r\nThere are four standard time meridians running through the United\r\nStates, as shown in the map in Fig. 165. The one running through New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware is the 75th meridian,\r\nmeaning of course that it is 75 degrees west of the prime meridian\r\nwhich passes through Greenwich. Time on this meridian and halfway to\r\nthe meridians on both sides of it is called _Eastern Time_. It is just\r\nfive hours slower than Greenwich time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.—STANDARD TIME MERIDIANS IN U. S.]\r\n\r\nThe next is the 90th meridian and this one passes through Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. Time on and\r\naround this meridian is called _Central Time_.\r\n\r\nThe one after this is the 105th meridian and passes through Montana,\r\nWyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. Time on and around this\r\nmeridian is called _Mountain Time_. The last of the four meridians, the\r\n120th, passes through the States of Washington, Oregon and California\r\nand time on and around this one is called _Pacific Time_. It is three\r\nhours slower than Eastern time and 8 hours slower than Greenwich time.\r\n\r\nAlthough these meridians are just one hour apart the time is not\r\nchanged on them nor exactly in the middle of a belt but at some\r\nwell-known town or city between two of the meridians, as you will see\r\nby looking at the map, Fig. 165. Fig. 166 shows the standard time at\r\ndifferent cities around the world north of the equator.\r\n\r\n=Star or Sidereal Time.=—Besides all the different kinds of time\r\ndescribed above there is still another and a very important kind of\r\ntime, and this is obtained by the stars.\r\n\r\nJust as Sun, or solar time is obtained by noting when the Sun crosses\r\na meridian, so _star_, or _sidereal time_ is obtained by observing\r\nwhen a star crosses a meridian. Now there is a difference between the\r\nlength of a day when formed by the Sun crossing the meridian twice in\r\nsuccession and when formed by a star crossing the meridian twice in\r\nsuccession. This difference in time, between a solar day and a sidereal\r\nday, as they are called, is nearly four minutes.\r\n\r\nBut the point is this: an astronomer can obtain the time from watching\r\na star cross the meridian much more accurately than he can from the\r\nSun, because a star is a mere point of light, and it is easier for him\r\nto calculate the mean solar time from the _transit_ of a star than it\r\nis for him to go to bed, and besides he would rather do it, too.\r\n\r\n=How Time Is Distributed.=—In this country the correct standard time is\r\nsent out by the United States Naval Observatory at Washington to all\r\ncities east of the Rocky Mountains, by _wire telegraph_, and all over\r\nthe Atlantic ocean and seaboard by _wireless telegraph_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.—STANDARD TIME AT DIFFERENT CITIES.]\r\n\r\nWhen time is received over the wires from Washington it is distributed\r\nby local telegraph or by _time balls_ to various jewelry stores and to\r\nprivate citizens who always want to be set right.\r\n\r\nHow an astronomer gets the correct time; how it is sent out over the\r\nwires and by wireless and how it is distributed to the common people is\r\na mighty interesting piece of business. Briefly it is like this:\r\n\r\n=How Correct Time Is Obtained.=—Every observatory has, besides its big\r\ntelescopes, a _transit instrument_, a wonderfully accurate _clock_,\r\nand a clockwork device called a _chronograph_. The transit instrument\r\nis nothing more than a telescope with a thin piece of clear glass with\r\na number of lines ruled on it with a diamond, about ⅛ inch apart, and\r\nthis ruled glass is set between the eyepiece and the object glass, as\r\nshown in Fig. 167.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.—RULED GLASS IN TRANSIT INSTRUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThis telescope, or transit instrument—so called because it is used to\r\nobserve the _transit_, or passage, of a star across a meridian—is set\r\non an axis so that the telescope can be pointed to any place on the\r\nmeridian but it cannot be moved east or west.\r\n\r\nSometime before a star is due to cross the meridian the astronomer sets\r\nhis transit instrument so that the star will pass right across the line\r\nof sight of his telescope.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of observing the transit, or passing of a star is to see\r\nhow much his wonderfully accurate clock has lost or gained during the\r\npast 24 hours. So his clock is right at hand.\r\n\r\nThe chronograph is another accurate clockwork which revolves a cylinder\r\nabout the size and shape of a phonograph cylinder, and around which\r\nis wrapped a sheet of white paper. This cylinder makes one revolution\r\nevery minute. A fountain pen marks a spiral line on the paper when the\r\ncylinder is revolving but at every second the pen is thrown out of\r\nposition and this makes a notch in the line.\r\n\r\nAfter starting the chronograph the astronomer takes an electric push\r\nbutton, which is connected with and controls the lever which holds\r\nthe pen of the chronograph that makes the notches, and takes up his\r\nposition with his eye at the end of the transit instrument.\r\n\r\nThe instant he sees the star on one of the lines in the telescope he\r\npresses the button and this closes the electric circuit and makes a big\r\nnotch in the line traced on the paper of the chronometer.\r\n\r\nFrom the position of the big notches which he caused to be made on the\r\npaper as the star crossed the ruled lines, and the little notches made\r\nregularly every second, he can dope out just how much his clock is in\r\nerror—that is, how much it is too fast or too slow.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he does is to change this absolutely correct star time\r\ninto mean solar time, when it is ready to be sent all over the United\r\nStates east of the Rocky Mountains by telegraph. The Pacific Coast\r\nfolks get their correct time from a Government observatory at Mare\r\nIsland in San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\n=How Time Is Sent by Telegraph.=—The wires of the Western Union\r\nTelegraph Company run into the United States Naval Observatory at\r\nWashington, and for a few minutes each day all of this company’s wires\r\nare controlled by the Government.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes before 12 o’clock noon, standard time at Washington,\r\neach day the wires all over the country east of the Rockies are\r\n_cleared_ and all business and other messages are cut off for the time\r\nsignals.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes of 12 sharp the United States Naval Observatory\r\nbegins to send the beats of every second of the wonderfully accurate\r\nobservatory clock, which are ticked out on telegraph sounders in all\r\nthe cities and towns.\r\n\r\nBut no, not every beat, for the 29th second of each minute, the last 5\r\nseconds of each of the first 4 minutes, and then the last 10 seconds of\r\nthe last minute are not sent. The first click of the sounder after the\r\n10 second rest is the noon signal, and all local clocks are set by it.\r\n\r\nIn many cities the telegraph company has special wires running to\r\nvarious jewelry and other stores and these subscribers get the correct\r\ntime direct by telegraph from the Naval Observatory for their sounders\r\nare connected in the regular line circuit.\r\n\r\n=The Time Ball.=—The Bureau of Navigation got up what is known as the\r\n_time ball_ for the benefit of sailing masters in particular and the\r\ntownsfolk in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.—THE TIME BALL.]\r\n\r\nIn New York and other cities along the seacoasts and lake ports a great\r\nball, weighing in the neighborhood of 100 pounds, having a diameter of\r\nover 3 feet and with a hole in its center, is slipped over a pole or\r\nflagstaff some 20 feet in height, which is mounted atop of some high\r\nbuilding where it can be seen to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThe ball is held in position at the top of the pole by an\r\nelectro-mechanical trigger, which is placed directly in the electric\r\ntelegraph circuit that runs into the Naval Observatory at Washington.\r\nWhen the time signals are being sent out from the observatory and the\r\ntelegraph key is closed at exactly noon the trigger which holds the\r\nball in place is released by the current and the ball drops. Fig. 168\r\nshows a time ball atop of the old Western Union Building in New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.—RECEIVING TIME SIGNALS BY WIRELESS.]\r\n\r\n=How Time is Sent by Wireless.=—At Arlington, Va., just across the\r\nPotomac River from Washington, is one of the most powerful wireless\r\nstations in the world, having a sending range of at least 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\nEvery day at noon time signals like those sent over the wires on land\r\nare sent out so that every navigation officer and sailing master whose\r\nships are fitted with wireless apparatus can get the correct time.\r\n\r\nAll over the Atlantic seaboard boys, as well as jewelers (see Fig.\r\n169), have wireless receiving sets and they receive the correct time\r\nevery day by wireless free of charge. No license is required to\r\nreceive wireless signals, the cost of the apparatus is little and the\r\nexperience immense. Are you in on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE STARS OF THE ZODIAC\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zodiac!=—It sounds to the untrained ear like the password of a\r\nbomb-thrower or a first cousin to a dish of Hungarian goulash.\r\n\r\nIt is enough, albeit, to scare even a Scout away from the stars, but be\r\nnot afraid, for it can’t hurt you and you can’t eat it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you are on speaking terms with the zodiac\r\n(pronounced zo´-di-ak), it will help you to find the planets and at the\r\nsame time you will add enough new constellations to those you already\r\nknow to give you a high passing mark for a merit badge in the Boy\r\nScouts if you want one. Besides, the signs and constellations of the\r\nzodiac will aid you to use the almanac and help you in many other ways.\r\n\r\nYou have often noticed that the Sun seems to travel through the sky\r\nover a path or belt that is always the same from west to east; you must\r\nhave noticed, too, that the path of the Moon is almost the same as\r\nthat of the Sun, but you may or may not remember that the planets also\r\ntravel over the same path as the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\nIt is just as though the Sun, Moon and planets moved at different\r\nspeeds on an endless belt in the sky which runs round the Earth nearly\r\nin a line with its equator, though tilted at a slight angle to it, and\r\nthis line is called the _ecliptic_. The way the ancients thought it was\r\nand the way it really looks to us is shown in Fig. 170.\r\n\r\nThe ancients called this apparent path of the Sun, Moon and planets\r\nwith the stars for a background the zodiac, so it is not such a\r\nhorrible specimen after all.\r\n\r\nWe know, of course, that the Sun is the center of our solar system\r\nand that the planets, including the Earth and Moon, are at various\r\ndistances from the Sun and that each moves in a path, or orbit, of its\r\nown, making a small angle with the ecliptic. What we call the Zodiac\r\ntakes in all these orbits and is, therefore, a belt of considerable\r\nwidth through the center of which runs the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.—THE ZODIAC AS INVENTED BY THE ANCIENTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.—THE ZODIAC AS WE KNOW IT TODAY.]\r\n\r\nSuppose we draw a little circle and call it the Sun, as shown in Fig.\r\n171, and draw an ellipse around it and call it the Earth’s orbit,\r\nputting on another little circle for the Earth; now suppose we draw\r\na much larger ellipse round the one representing the Earth’s orbit,\r\ndivide it into 12 parts and put a constellation in each part.\r\n\r\nKnowing now that the Sun, Moon and planets are very near the Earth\r\nwhen compared with the fixed stars it must be plain that these bodies\r\nwhen seen from the Earth, which is always changing its position in\r\nits travels round the Sun, would appear to move in and across the\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nTake a look at Jupiter some night when he is moving across any of the\r\nconstellations and he will seem to be a part of it; this is the reason\r\nwe speak of the Sun or a planet as being in a certain constellation at\r\na given time.\r\n\r\nThe stars forming the background of the Moon and the planets can always\r\nbe seen, for we are then looking at them from the dark side of the\r\nEarth, but they cannot be seen when they form the background of the\r\nSun, for the stars are on the other side of him when he gets between us\r\nand them and he shines in our eyes.\r\n\r\nThese constellations through which the Sun, Moon and planets seem to\r\npass, or as the almanacs say are _in_, lie in a belt formed by the path\r\nof the Sun and neither the Moon nor the planets ever get farther from\r\nthe path of the Sun than 8 degrees on either side of him and this belt\r\nis called the zodiac.\r\n\r\nThe belt, or zodiac, is divided into 12 equal parts, or spaces, which\r\nwere called _signs_ by the ancients and they are still called signs.\r\nThis makes the length of each sign, or space, 30 degrees, and hence the\r\n12 signs, which are called the _Signs of the Zodiac_, equal 360 degrees\r\nor a complete circle. (See Chapter X, _The Time o’ Day_.)\r\n\r\nThe Signs of the Zodiac and the constellations of the Zodiac have\r\nthe following names: _Aries_, the Ram; _Taurus_, the Bull; _Gemini_,\r\nthe Twins; _Cancer_, the Crab; _Leo_, the Lion; _Virgo_, the Virgin;\r\n_Libra_, the Balance; _Scorpio_, the Scorpion; _Sagittarius_, the\r\nArcher; _Capricornus_, the Goat; _Aquarius_, the Water Bearer, and\r\n_Pisces_, the Fishes. It is in one of these constellations that the\r\nSun, Moon and planets are always to be found.\r\n\r\nA good way to find any one of the constellations is by knowing the time\r\nwhen it will be on your meridian, that is the line over your head due\r\nnorth and south, during a given month. Any constellation of the zodiac\r\nwill be on your meridian at 9 o’clock P. M., during the month given\r\nopposite its name in the following table:\r\n\r\n     -----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n                |                  |                 |Time Constellation\r\n    Astronomical|  How Pronounced  | Common Names    |will Appear on Your\r\n        Names   |                  |                 |Meridian at 9 P. M.\r\n     -----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n     Aries      | A´-ri-es         | The Ram         |  December\r\n     Taurus     | Tau´-rus         | The Bull        |  January\r\n     Gemini     | Gem´-i-ni        | The Twins       |  February\r\n     Cancer     | Can´-cer         | The Crab        |  March\r\n     Leo        | Le´-o            | The Lion        |  April\r\n     Virgo      | Vir´-go          | The Virgin      |  May\r\n     Libra      | Li´-bra          | The Balance     |  June\r\n     Scorpio    | Scor´-pi-o       | The Scorpion    |  July\r\n     Sagittarius| Sag´-it-ta´-ri-us| The Archer      |  August\r\n     Capricornus| Cap´-ri-cor´-nus | The Goat        |  September\r\n     Aquarius   | A-qua´-ri-us     | The Water Bearer|  October\r\n     Pisces     | Pis´-ces         | The Fishes      |  November\r\n     -----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nTo find any constellation during any other month than that given in the\r\nlast column above subtract two hours for each following month. Suppose\r\nyou want to find Aries, the Ram, in January instead of December, look\r\nfor it on your meridian at 7 P. M.; in February look for it at 5 P. M.,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nYou will of course come to a month where the constellation will run\r\ninto daylight and then you won’t be able to see it again until the\r\nEarth has traveled round the Sun to a point where the Earth is again\r\nbetween the Sun and the constellation.\r\n\r\nThe constellations of the zodiac are shown in Fig. 172; also the symbol\r\nfor each sign and the month in which the sun enters the sign. As we\r\nshall later explain, the constellation is no longer in the sign of the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\nIf you look southward at the sky some night for any particular\r\nconstellation you need not expect the stars which form it to stand\r\nout separate and distinct, as shown in Figs. 172 and 174; if you do\r\nyou will be sadly disappointed, for many of the constellations of the\r\nzodiac are hard to recognize compared with the Big Dipper, or Orion, or\r\nPegasus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--CONSTELLATIONS AND SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.]\r\n\r\nNor are the constellations of the zodiac as equally spaced in the sky\r\nas in Figs. 172 and 174. Some of the stars are very scattered and\r\nstretch over part of two signs of the zodiac, while others do not take\r\nup nearly all the space allowed them; Figs. 172-174 are but rough\r\nsketches. To recognize these constellations you will have to use a good\r\nstar map.\r\n\r\nThe heavy black line drawn lengthwise through the middle of the strip\r\nin Fig. 172 represents the line of the ecliptic which is the yearly\r\npath the Sun seems to take. The planets also take the same course,\r\nthough they may be on one side or the other of the Sun’s path by 8\r\ndegrees, thus making the zodiac 16 degrees wide; hence, the lighter\r\nparallel lines on either side of the black line, or path of the Sun, is\r\nthe farthest away that the planets ever get.\r\n\r\nIf you were to cut the strip of paper, Fig. 172, out of the book and\r\npaste the ends together, you would have a band, or circle representing\r\nthe zodiac more nearly as it is; but instead of cutting the book you\r\nhad better draw the signs and constellations on a strip of cardboard\r\n2 inches wide and 24 inches long and glue the ends together, as shown\r\nin Fig. 173; you will now have a zodiac with which you can do a little\r\nexperimenting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--CARDBOARD ZODIAC.]\r\n\r\nPlace a candlelight in the center of the cardboard ring and suspend a\r\nmarble from a thread, by means of a drop of sealing wax, and let the\r\nmarble hang between the light and the cardboard zodiac. As seen from\r\nthe marble, which represents the earth, the candle, representing the\r\nsun, is in the constellation directly opposite the one in which the\r\nshadow of the marble falls.\r\n\r\nIn the almanacs our year begins with January and as the Sun is then in\r\nthe sign Aquarius, this month is represented by a picture of Aquarius,\r\nthe Water Bearer; but in marking out the signs of the zodiac on a flat\r\nstrip of paper we begin with Aries, which the Sun enters in the month\r\nof March, and read them from right to left.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because the Earth travels round the Sun\r\ncounter-clockwise as seen from the north and this makes the Sun appear\r\nto move eastward through the constellations of the zodiac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--CONSTELLATIONS OF ZODIAC IN CIRCLE.]\r\n\r\nThis makes all the months follow each other in the proper order when\r\nthe strip of paper is glued together, as shown in Fig. 173, or when the\r\nconstellations are arranged in a circle, as shown in Fig. 174.\r\n\r\nThis latter diagram shows plainly that when the Earth is at that part\r\nof its orbit marked A the constellation of Taurus is back of the Sun.\r\nIf we are on that side of the Earth which is toward the Sun of course\r\nwe cannot see Taurus for the Sun, which is shining in our eyes.\r\n\r\nStill Taurus is the background of the Sun just the same, and so when\r\nthe almanac says the Sun is in Taurus you will know that the Sun is\r\ndirectly between the Earth and Taurus.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of all the planets. Take Mars, for example;\r\nwhenever Mars is in that part of its orbit so that we can see it at\r\nnight, as shown at B, Fig. 172, we also see the constellation back of\r\nit--in this case it is Libra, the Balance--and since a planet and a\r\nfixed star look exactly alike to the naked eye it is easy to think of\r\nMars as being in that constellation; and it is the same with all the\r\nother planets.\r\n\r\n=The Constellations of the Zodiac.=--The _Constellations of the Zodiac_\r\nand the _Signs of the Zodiac_ are two very different things. Long ago,\r\nwhen the zodiac was invented, the constellation of Aries, the Ram, was\r\nin the first of the 12 spaces and he and the _sign_ of this space were\r\nof course at that time the same.\r\n\r\nOwing to a peculiar motion of the Earth, called _precession_, the signs\r\nof the zodiac have moved backward during the last 2,000 years and the\r\nsign of Aries, which used to be in the constellation of Aries, is now\r\nin the constellation of Pisces, the Fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Aquarius, the Water Man.=--A constellation of autumn: Aquarius is\r\nalways pictured in the almanacs as pouring water from a pitcher.\r\n\r\nAll the stars of this constellation are faint and scattered and none of\r\nthem are in a line with the ecliptic. Aquarius got his name from the\r\nRomans, who called him the _Waterman_ because when the Sun enters the\r\nsign Aquarius in January there are usually heavy rains in Italy and in\r\nthe long ago people thought the stars had a lot to do with the weather,\r\nand everything else on Earth, for that matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--CONSTELLATIONS OF ARIES THE RAM.]\r\n\r\n=Pisces, the Fishes.=--This constellation is now in that part of the\r\nzodiac whose sign is ♈ (Aries). It is not an interesting constellation\r\nto look at with the naked eye, for its stars are faint and they stream\r\nout in two lines over nearly two signs of the zodiac.\r\n\r\nBut Pisces is none the less a very important constellation because it\r\nis at one of the points where the line of the equator crosses the line\r\nof the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun crosses the point where the equator and the ecliptic meet\r\nthe days and nights are then equal at all places on the Earth, and\r\nhence we call this time of the year, which is about the twenty-first\r\nof March, the _equinox_, which means equal days; or the _vernal\r\nequinox_, which means equal spring days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Aries, the Ram.=--This constellation used to be in that part of the\r\nzodiac whose sign is ♈ (Aries) but is now in that part whose sign is ♉\r\n(Taurus).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe position of Aries in the sky is shown in Fig. 175 and you can\r\neasily find him by drawing a line from the North Star to _Alpha_ in\r\nPegasus and another line at right angles to the first line until you\r\ncome to two bright stars quite close together and a third one not quite\r\nso bright. These are the chief stars of the constellation of the Ram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Taurus, the Bull.=--This constellation is now in the sign ♊ (Gemini),\r\nof the zodiac. In Chapter II you will find directions for locating\r\nTaurus. You will remember that the red star Aldebaran forms the right\r\neye of the Bull. The little group of stars called the _Hyades_ is the\r\nBull’s face and the Pleiades are in his shoulder.\r\n\r\n=Gemini, the Twins.=--It is easy to see why the ancients called this\r\nconstellation of the zodiac the Twins, for its two chief stars,\r\n_Castor_ and _Pollux_, are quite close together and while of different\r\ncolors they are of about the same brightness.\r\n\r\nThese two stars are the heads of the Twins and four other stars are\r\ntheir feet and these stand forever on the Milky Way. The Twins are\r\neasily found since they are next to Taurus, the Bull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGemini is an important constellation, as the Sun reaches its most\r\nnorthern point in it in summer; this is called the _summer solstice_,\r\nand takes place about June 21. When the Sun has reached this point it\r\ncasts the shortest shadow at mid-day and it seems to stand still for a\r\nfew days before it takes its downward course. The summer solstice is\r\nhalfway between the two points of the equinox.\r\n\r\n=Cancer, the Crab.=--This is a small constellation of dull stars that\r\nis chiefly interesting because it once contained the point of the\r\nsummer solstice, but that was ages ago.\r\n\r\nThe only thing about Cancer to attract attention is a hazy patch of\r\nlight called the _Manger_. On each side of the Manger is a fairly\r\nbright star and this pair of stars is called the _Ass’s Colts_; they\r\nwill help you to find Cancer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Manger has often been mistaken for a comet by those who lit upon it\r\nwith the naked eye, but it is really a cluster of small stars.\r\n\r\n=Leo, the Lion.=--There are two separate groups of stars that make up\r\nthis king of beasts. The first group takes the shape of a _sickle_ and\r\nthe other the form of a _square_. The sickle, which is formed of six\r\nbright stars, is Leo’s head and shoulders, and the four stars of the\r\nsquare make up his hindquarters.\r\n\r\nTwo lines, drawn from the Big Dipper across the sky, as shown in Fig.\r\n176, will meet the sickle and the square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe very bright star in the end of the handle of the sickle is\r\n_Regulus_, which means little king, and far to the other side of the\r\nconstellation right in the end of the Lion’s tail is another bright\r\nstar called _Denebola_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--CONSTELLATIONS OF THE LION AND BIG DIPPER.]\r\n\r\n=Virgo, the Virgin.=--This constellation is of interest, because the\r\nSun again crosses the point where the equator and ecliptic meet, and\r\nthe days and nights are again of the same length everywhere on the\r\nEarth, just as they were at the spring, or _vernal equinox_.\r\n\r\nBut this time, when the Sun is in Virgo, it crosses the equator from\r\nnorth to south about September 21 and so this _equinox_ is called the\r\n_autumnal equinox_, which means equal autumn days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy drawing a line from Polaris through Mizarin through the handle\r\nof the Big Dipper and producing it beyond Arcturus, and on until it\r\nreaches a big, bright, white star you will have reached Virgo, as shown\r\nin Fig. 177. This big, white, bright star is Spica, and it is the chief\r\nstar in Virgo.\r\n\r\nThe ancients always represented Virgo, the Virgin, with a sheaf of\r\nwheat in one hand and a sickle in the other. The Virgin and the harvest\r\nalways went together in the minds of the ancients and this accounts for\r\nthe pictures of Virgo in the almanacs of the present time.\r\n\r\n=Libra, the Balance.=--A small constellation named for the ancient\r\nRoman pound weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Libra is not nearly as old as the others in\r\nthe zodiac, in fact it is thought that there were only eleven\r\nconstellations in the zodiac when they were first mapped out thousands\r\nof years ago, although there were twelve signs or spaces in the zodiac.\r\nIts position is shown in Fig. 178.\r\n\r\nThen in the days of the Roman Empire, about 300 years before Christ,\r\nsome genius clipped the claws of the Scorpion and made its stars into a\r\npair of scales. This was a very clever idea, for the autumnal equinox\r\nthen took place in this sign of the zodiac, and the stars in this sign\r\nwere given the name of Libra, as the equal days and nights called to\r\nmind the balance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--CONSTELLATIONS OF VIRGO THE VIRGIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--LIBRA, LION, SCORPIO, VIRGO.]\r\n\r\n=Scorpius, the Scorpion.=--A summer constellation. If Libra takes up\r\nonly a small part of one sign of the zodiac Scorpius makes up for it by\r\nnearly covering two signs.\r\n\r\nTo the old astrologers, Scorpius was the “power of darkness” and the\r\n“accursed constellation,” and when they cast their _horoscopes_ they\r\nattributed to it “woe and discord, war and disease.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Scorpius is one of the very few which really looks\r\nits part. In the end of its curved tail there are two stars which are\r\nready to sting if he ever strikes, but he has never struck yet.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the Scorpion is a big, bright red star called _Antares_,\r\nwhich means the rival of Mars, and when Mars is in the constellation of\r\nScorpius it is hard to tell them apart.\r\n\r\nAntares will prove useful in finding the Scorpion as there are no other\r\nbright stars in that part of the sky. The position of Scorpius is shown\r\nin Fig. 178.\r\n\r\n=Sagittarius, the Archer.=--A summer constellation: It is made up of\r\nmany stars which can be seen with the naked eye and is always pictured\r\nin the almanacs as a _centaur_, or man-horse, shooting an arrow from a\r\nbow at the heart of the Scorpion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSagittarius is a fine constellation, right in the path of the Milky\r\nWay, and this makes it easy to find. There are several interesting\r\nthings in this constellation and among them are the clusters of stars\r\nand nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThen there are seven stars in Sagittarius, which make a little dipper\r\nturned upside down, and because it is in the Milky Way it is called the\r\n_milk dipper_; when you once find it, you will never be able to see\r\nSagittarius again without seeing the milk dipper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--LYRA, AQUILA, CAPRICORNUS.]\r\n\r\nThe _winter solstice_, that is, the most southern point which the\r\nSun reaches, lies halfway between the constellations of Scorpius and\r\nSagittarius and also between the two stream lines of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun reaches this point, which is the 20th of December, the\r\nnoonday shadows are the longest and the Sun seems to again stand still\r\nuntil Christmas, when he will begin to move north once more.\r\n\r\n=Capricornus, the Sea-Goat.=--A constellation of autumn: On the same\r\nplan that the ancients made Sagittarius a man-horse, so they made\r\nCapricornus a goat-fish.\r\n\r\nThough Capricornus is a small and poor constellation when viewed with\r\nthe naked eye, the early astrologers thought more of him than all the\r\nother constellations of the zodiac put together.\r\n\r\nWhile the stars of Capricornus do not look anything like a sea-goat, he\r\ncan be easily found by drawing a line from Vega in Lyra to Altair in\r\nAquila and producing it until you come to the zodiac as shown in Fig.\r\n179.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two brightest stars of Capricornus are in his head. One of these\r\nstars is a naked eye double, but to many people it will seem merely a\r\nsingle star. As a matter of fact it is a fine sight test, for it takes\r\na pair of mighty good eyes to separate them. Another bright star of the\r\nsea-goat is in his fishlike tail.\r\n\r\nWe have journeyed clear around the great circle which the Sun travels\r\nevery year, and we are back again to Aquarius, the constellation we\r\nstarted from, having covered all the constellations of the zodiac.\r\n\r\n=The Signs of the Zodiac.=--Where the signs of the zodiac are used in\r\nalmanacs they do not mean the constellations of the same name at all,\r\nbut the spaces or parts of the great circle which form the zodiac.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years ago the constellations and the signs of the same\r\nname were in the same spaces or parts of the zodiac, but the signs, by\r\nprecession, have shifted over one space to the west since that time,\r\nwhile the constellations have of course remained unchanged, and this\r\nhas made a good deal of confusion.\r\n\r\nIt’s a pretty skillet of fish, this mixing of the signs and\r\nconstellations of the zodiac, but you will get used to it just as\r\neasily as you get used to carrying water when in camp or washing\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\n=How to Read the Almanac.=--If you were asked to find the date of any\r\nday of any month of the year you would simply look at a calendar and\r\nfind it in a jiffy.\r\n\r\nNow, long before calendars came into general use the almanac was\r\nfreely consulted, not only for learning days and dates, but for much\r\nmore useful information, such as finding the dates of eclipses, the\r\nbeginning of seasons, the rising and setting of the Sun, Moon and\r\nplanets and the _conjunctions_ and _oppositions_ of these bodies,\r\nplanting potatoes and the year the father of your country was born.\r\n\r\nTo read an almanac easily you should learn the following signs:\r\n\r\n    ☉ The Sun           ☿ Mercury\r\n    ○ Full Moon          ♀ Venus\r\n    ☾ Last Quarter      ♁ The Earth\r\n    ● New Moon           ♂ Mars\r\n    ☽ First Quarter\r\n\r\n    ♃ Jupiter           ☌ Conjunction\r\n    ♄ Saturn            ☍ Opposition\r\n    ♅ Uranus\r\n    ♆ Neptune\r\n\r\n_Conjunction._--When this sign is used it means that two planets, or\r\nthe Sun and a planet, or the Moon and a planet, are on the _same_ side\r\nof the Earth.\r\n\r\n_Opposition._--When this sign is used it means that two planets, or the\r\nSun and a planet, or the Moon and a planet, are on opposite sides of\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nTo see how these signs work out suppose you look up the month of\r\nJanuary, 1915, in an almanac.\r\n\r\nThe first line, besides showing that it is the first day of the year,\r\nthe first day of the month and that it is Friday, also shows that the ○\r\n(Moon) is full. It further gives the time the ☉ (Sun) rises and sets,\r\nthe length of the days in hours and minutes, the ○ (Moon’s) age in\r\ndays, and when it rises and sets.\r\n\r\nThen on the same line the following signs are given: ♂ ☿ ☌ and this\r\nmeans that a conjunction of Mercury and Mars will take place on this\r\ndate; that is, that they will be nearer to each other from our line of\r\nsight than at any other time for a long while.\r\n\r\nOn the next line, which is the 2nd of January, the following signs are\r\ngiven: ♀ _greatest brilliancy_; ♁ _in perihelion_ ☌ ♆ ☾; the first of\r\nwhich means that Venus has reached its greatest brightness; the second,\r\nthat the Earth is the nearest to the Sun that it will get, and the\r\nthird, that there is a conjunction of Neptune and the Moon; and so on\r\nfor every day of the year.\r\n\r\n_Note_: A good almanac for daily star information is the _Old Farmers’\r\nAlmanac_, a copy of which you can get by sending 11 cents to William\r\nWare and Company, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nVALUABLE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n=Photographing the Stars.=--There are some interesting things you can\r\ndo with an ordinary _camera_ in the way of photographing the stars.\r\n\r\nA camera is made up of three principal parts, and these are (1) a\r\nconvex lens, which forms the image of the object to be photographed;\r\n(2) a light-tight box, which keeps out all the light except that which\r\npasses through the lens, and (3) a plate, or film holder, which holds\r\nthe sensitive plate, or film, in the camera and keeps it perfectly dark\r\nuntil you are ready to have the image formed on it.\r\n\r\nThe instant the lens is allowed to form an image on the _sensitive\r\nplate_, or _film_, we get out of the _optics_ of photography and into\r\nthe _chemistry_ of it.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive plate, or film, is coated with a thin layer of salts\r\nof silver and bromide, heated with gelatine and a little water, and\r\nwhen these substances are thoroughly mixed, an _emulsion_ results,\r\nand this is spread on glass plates or on celluloid films. When the\r\nplate is exposed, that is, when the image has been formed on it, it is\r\ndeveloped. The developing is done by placing the plate in a solution of\r\n_pyrogallic acid_, or _hydroquinone_ and water.\r\n\r\nThe plate, or film, is now put in the _fixing bath_, which is simply a\r\nsolution of _hyposulphite of soda_ and water. This fixing bath prevents\r\nany further action of the light on the plate, or film.\r\n\r\nBut the picture on the glass plate, or celluloid film, looks all same\r\nlike a Chinese chromo, for the light and dark parts are just the\r\nreverse of that of the object which was photographed; in other words,\r\nwhere the picture should be white, it is black, and where it should be\r\nblack, it is white, and this is the reason it is called a _negative_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--CAMERA POINTING TO NORTH STAR.]\r\n\r\nTo get a picture of the object, as it looks to the eye, a sheet of\r\npaper, also coated with salts of silver, is laid flat on the negative\r\nand held close to it in a _printing frame_ when it is exposed to the\r\nlight of the Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the paper is printed dark enough by the Sun, it is _toned_ to give\r\nit a pleasing color and _fixed_ to make it last a long time, and when\r\nwashed and dried the image of the object, true to life, is there, a\r\nwonderful record for all time, nearly.\r\n\r\nThis then, briefly, is how the Sun, or other source of light, makes\r\nan image, how the image is fixed on a dry plate, or film, and how a\r\npicture is printed from the negative, and having found out this much\r\nlet’s see how we can make it do a little star work for us.\r\n\r\nThere is not much we can do in the way of making pictures of the\r\nthings in the sky with a small camera, but the few things we can do\r\nare mighty interesting, and show the stars in a way you can never see\r\nthem with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nTo make _star trails_ is one of these interesting things. First, set\r\nyour camera on a _tripod_, or other firm support, and focus it on a\r\ntree or something as far off as you can see it in the daytime. Now, on\r\na dark night, when there is no Moon, set your camera so that the lens\r\nis pointing directly at the North Star, as shown in Fig. 180. Set the\r\nshutter of your camera for a _time exposure_ and open it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181. STAR TRAILS.]\r\n\r\nYou can go to bed now and let the stars work for you while you sleep,\r\nthat is if you can get up before daylight the next morning, but if you\r\ncannot do this stay up as long as you can, three or four hours, anyway,\r\nbefore you close the shutter.\r\n\r\nNow, when you develop the plate, or film, and make a print from it\r\nyou will have a record of the apparent path of the stars, as shown in\r\nFig. 181, but which is, of course, due to the Earth turning round on\r\nits axis. If you set your camera with the lens pointing toward the\r\necliptic, that is, the path of the Sun, the star trails will be long,\r\nstraight lines, and this will make another interesting record.\r\n\r\nBy pointing your camera toward that part of the sky and during that\r\ntime of the year when there are showers of meteors, and opening the\r\nshutter of your lens, you stand a chance, though it is not a very fat\r\none, of catching one of these wily shooting stars on your plate, and if\r\nyou do succeed--well, you will have a picture that is a curiosity.\r\n\r\nYou can photograph the Sun with an ordinary camera and make his disk\r\nas large as you want to, but you will get nothing more on your plate\r\nthan a white spot. The Moon can likewise be photographed, but if you\r\nfocus it sharp on the plate it will not be much larger than a mere\r\npoint of light, and if you get a disk large enough to see there will\r\nonly be a small white spot on your finished print.\r\n\r\nTo make good photographs of the Sun, Moon and planets, a big telescope\r\ndriven by clockwork to offset the turning of the Earth is needed. Such\r\na telescope is called an _equatorial telescope_, and when it is set so\r\nthat an object in the sky is in the field of view, it will remain right\r\nthere as long as you want it, and when you make a photograph of the\r\nobject it will be as sharp and as clear as though both it and the Earth\r\nwere standing perfectly still.\r\n\r\nIf you think enough of the stars to try to photograph them with your\r\nlittle camera, I should say there is a very good chance of your being\r\nable to photograph them sometime through an equatorial telescope _for\r\nall things come to the boy who wants them hard enough_.\r\n\r\n=What the Stars Are Made of.=--To know what the stars are made of is to\r\nknow more about them than men knew of the Earth a few hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nBut just think of looking at a star like Aldebaran, which is so far\r\naway that it takes 45 years for its light to reach the Earth--light\r\ntravels eleven million miles a minute--and then saying it is made\r\nof iron, and mercury and hydrogen and sodium and half a dozen other\r\nsubstances!\r\n\r\nNow you ask, “How is it done?” And I’ll say with a _glass prism_, and\r\nthen we’ll have made a flying start. Now a glass prism is a three-sided\r\npiece of glass--the ends don’t count--as shown in Fig. 144, and it is\r\njust as wonderful in its way as a lens is wonderful in its way.\r\n\r\nIf you will hold a prism to your eye and look at the flame of a candle\r\nthrough it, you will see the flame in all the brilliant colors of the\r\nrainbow, and these bright colors form what is called a _spectrum_.\r\n\r\nNow make another experiment; cover a window, on which the Sun shines,\r\nwith a sheet of cardboard, in the middle of which you have cut a\r\nhorizontal slit with a sharp knife, about 1 inch long and ¹/₂₅ inch\r\nwide. Make the room perfectly dark except for the light which comes\r\nin through the slit in the cardboard, and set a prism in front of the\r\nslit, as shown in Fig. 145. The beam of sunlight which passes through\r\nthe prism will be split up, or _decomposed_, as it is called, into the\r\nseven colors of the rainbow, but the colors will be much brighter.\r\n\r\nIf you will fix another sheet of white cardboard in a _vertical_\r\nposition so that the colors will shine on it in a band, the colors,\r\nbeginning with red at the bottom, next orange, then yellow, green,\r\nblue, indigo and violet, will follow each other to the top bright and\r\nbeautiful. These rainbow colors, spread out in a band on the screen,\r\nform what is called the _solar spectrum_, that is, the spectrum which\r\nis produced by sunlight.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully colored spectrum is really made up of a great many\r\nimages of the slit in the cardboard, one for each wave-length of the\r\nlight. If the slit is made very narrow, the images of the slit will\r\nnot overlap much and you can tell whether any of the wave-lengths are\r\nmissing by looking for fine black lines crossing the spectrum. Such\r\ndark lines are very important in finding out what the Sun and Stars are\r\nmade of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--BOY LOOKING THROUGH PRISM AT SLIT IN\r\nCARDBOARD.]\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is to stand away from the slit five or six feet\r\nand look at the beam of light through a prism just as you did at the\r\nflame of the candle. This is the simplest form of a _spectroscope_,\r\nthat is an instrument for splitting up the light of any object which is\r\nself-luminous, into a spectrum, as shown in Fig. 182.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the sunlight streaming in through the slit in the\r\ncardboard you will see a number of dark lines crossing the colored\r\nband. These dark lines are called _Fraunhofer’s lines_, because\r\nFraunhofer, who was a German telescope maker, was the first to show\r\nhow important they are. The chief dark lines of the Sun’s spectrum are\r\nknown by the letters of the alphabet, and, like the colored images of\r\nthe slit, they are always in the same place. They are shown in Fig. 183.\r\n\r\nHaving found out a little about the spectrum and how it is formed by\r\nthe Sun, let’s find out next how it tells us what the Sun and the stars\r\nare made of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--FRAUNHOFER’S LINES.]\r\n\r\nNow, in the Sun’s spectrum there are a pair of lines close together and\r\nnear the middle which are called the D lines--see Fig. 183--and when a\r\nbeam of sunlight is split up by a spectroscope, or rather by the prism\r\nof a spectroscope, these D lines always appear in the yellow part of\r\nthe spectrum.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, and not so very long ago, when no one had the\r\nfaintest idea why the Sun’s light did not contain these two\r\nwave-lengths, when the spectrum from a candle flame was a continuous\r\nband of light without dark lines. Then two experimenters, Kirchhoff\r\nand Bunsen, found that various substances when converted into luminous\r\ngases in a hot flame always produced spectra which consisted only\r\nof certain _bright lines_. Thus it was found that sodium gas gives\r\ntwo bright lines in the exact positions of the D lines of the Sun’s\r\nspectrum. This made it look as if the Sun contained no sodium. But\r\nthe experimenters did something else: they placed a very brilliant\r\nlight back of the sodium gas and on looking through their spectroscope\r\nthey saw a continuous spectrum with black D lines. This meant that\r\nthe sodium gas had absorbed from the light passing through it the\r\nwave-lengths which it had given out when shining by itself. We now\r\nknow that the Sun is surrounded by a layer of gases which is somewhat\r\ncooler than the interior of the Sun and that each substance in this\r\n“reversing layer,” as it is called, takes out some of the light which\r\nis characteristic of it and thus produces the Fraunhofer lines.\r\n\r\nIn the same way iron and other metals and sodium and other substances\r\nwhich are heated until they become gases, and hydrogen and other gases\r\nwhich are aflame, produce spectra consisting of certain bright lines,\r\nand as the light from the Sun also produces black lines in the same\r\nidentical places, it is known that the Sun contains these different\r\nsubstances which are heated up in it to a white heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--THE SPECTROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nIt’s the same thing with the stars. It makes no difference if the light\r\nis made by burning some substance a few inches away from the slit of\r\nthe spectroscope, or whether it has traveled 90 millions of miles from\r\nthe Sun--which takes about 8½ minutes, or 45 years for the light to\r\nreach it from Aldebaran, it always acts exactly in the same way; and so\r\nwe know a good deal about the stuff the stars are made of.\r\n\r\nLet’s see now, how a real spectroscope is made, for it isn’t always\r\nconvenient to have a pitch dark room, nor is it a very exact way to\r\nhold the prism to your eye when examining the light of burning sodium,\r\nor hydrogen gas, or other substances.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope is an instrument made so that the light of a\r\nsubstance burned at one end will pass through a prism and will form a\r\nspectrum on the retina of the eye at the other end. It is usually made\r\nup of two tubes mounted on a stand at an angle with the prism between\r\nthem, as shown in Fig. 184.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the first tube, which is called a _collimator_, a very\r\nnarrow slit is cut, and it is at this end that the substance is placed\r\nwhich is to be burned and whose light is to be split up and examined.\r\n\r\nA convex lens is fitted in the other end of the collimator, or first\r\ntube, so that the light after passing through the slit will then\r\npass in a beam through the prism. The other tube--the one you look\r\nthrough--is called a _telescope_ and in this one is fitted a convex\r\nobject glass and an eyepiece which magnifies the spectrum made by the\r\nprism.\r\n\r\nWhen a camera is used to photograph the spectrum the eyepiece is taken\r\nout of the tube of the spectroscope and a little camera is put in its\r\nplace. In this way the camera and the spectroscope are combined and\r\nthis helps chemists to compare the _spectra_ of different burning\r\nsubstances far better than they could do with the naked eye alone.\r\n\r\nTo photograph the spectrum of the Sun the eyepiece of the big telescope\r\nis taken out and the end of the tube of the spectroscope with the slit\r\nin it is fitted in its place. In making a photograph of the spectrum of\r\na star the slit is not needed, for the light of the star itself is but\r\na mere point.\r\n\r\nIn photographing the spectrum of the Sun and stars three wonderful\r\ninstruments are combined, namely, the _telescope_, the _spectroscope_\r\nand the _camera_; perhaps I should have said four wonderful\r\ninstruments, for without the _brain_ of a genius using them the Sun and\r\nstars never would have given up their secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nAccording to the official _Handbook of the Boy Scouts_, if you are a\r\nScout and want to win a merit badge for starcraft, you must\r\n\r\n    (1) _Have a general knowledge of the nature of the\r\n        stars and planets._\r\n\r\n      (a) By the nature of the stars and planets is meant\r\n          their colors and what they are made of. Their\r\n          sizes and their distances from the Earth in a\r\n          general way may also be included.\r\n\r\n      (b) It is easy to tell the color of both the stars\r\n          and the planets by looking at them, or by looking\r\n          them up in the foregoing chapters.\r\n\r\n      (c) The spectroscope shows that the stars are made\r\n          of metals and gases and other substances which\r\n          we have on Earth. The planets are probably\r\n          made of the same kinds of metals, gases and\r\n          substances as those which form the Earth, but\r\n          there is no way of proving this, for the planets\r\n          shine by reflected light, and in this case the\r\n          spectroscope is of little use.\r\n\r\n      (d) The stars are known to be suns as large or larger\r\n          than our Sun; while the planets are about as\r\n          large as our Earth--some smaller and some larger.\r\n\r\n      (e) All of the planets are within 2,800 millions\r\n          of miles of the Earth, while the nearest star,\r\n          except our Sun, is 25 trillions of miles from the\r\n          Earth, or 8,000 times as far away.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Have a general knowledge of the movements of the\r\n        stars and planets._\r\n\r\n      (a) While all the stars revolve in orbits and are\r\n          moving through space at high speed, they are so\r\n          far away from us that they seem to be fixed and\r\n          for all practical purposes they may be considered\r\n          to be fixed in their positions.\r\n\r\n      (b) All the planets turn on their own axes and travel\r\n          in orbits round the Sun.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Point out and name 12 principal\r\n        constellations._\r\n\r\n      (a) Twelve easy constellations are: (1) The Big\r\n          Dipper; (2) The Little Dipper; (3) Cassiopeia;\r\n          (4) Pegasus; (5) Orion; (6) Auriga and (7)\r\n          Taurus, all of which are shown in Chapters I\r\n          and II; (8) Gemini; (9) Leo; (10) Virgo; (11)\r\n          The Scorpion, and (12) Sagittarius, which are\r\n          constellations of the zodiac, and are shown in\r\n          Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n    (4) _Find the_ =North= _by means of other\r\n        stars than the Pole Star_ (_which is the North\r\n        Star_) _in case that star is obscured by\r\n        clouds._\r\n\r\n      (a) This can be done by finding the constellation of\r\n          Cassiopeia, see Chapter I; and also by Pegasus;\r\n          Auriga and Orion, as explained in Chapter II.\r\n\r\n    (5) _Have a general knowledge of the positions and\r\n        movements of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and the Planets;\r\n        and of tides, eclipses, meteors and comets._\r\n\r\n      (a) By reading the chapters on the Sun, Planets,\r\n          Earth and Moon and\r\n\r\n      (b) Other things in the sky carefully, you will be\r\n          able to pass the requirements named in No. 5.\r\n\r\n    (6) _Plot on at least two nights per month for six\r\n        months the positions of all naked eye planets\r\n        visible between sundown and one hour thereafter.\r\n        The plot of each planet shall contain at least\r\n        three fixed stars with their names or designations;\r\n        colors of planets and stars are to be recorded as\r\n        observed._\r\n\r\n       (a) How to plot the position of a planet is fully\r\n          explained in the chapter on Planets, but you\r\n          should also read the one on The Stars of the\r\n          Zodiac, and have a good star map (App. O).\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n=Figures.=--When explaining the positions and forms of things, it is\r\noften necessary to use certain terms and figures, that is to say, lines\r\nwhich are either real or imaginary, but which can be drawn on paper.\r\nSee Fig. 185.\r\n\r\n(1) A _straight line_ is, of course, a line which runs uniformly in the\r\nsame direction, and which is regular and without curves. A straight\r\nline is the shortest distance between two points. (2) When we say that\r\nlines are _parallel_, we mean that they lie so that every part of each\r\nis equally spaced from the other. (3) A line is _horizontal_ when it\r\nis parallel with the level surface of the Earth under it. (4) A line\r\nis _perpendicular_ to the surface of the Earth when it is _plumb_,\r\nthat is, in a line with the center of the Earth. (5) A _vertical line_\r\ngenerally means a plumb line. (6) A _right angle_ is formed when a\r\nvertical, or a perpendicular, line meets a horizontal line. (7) A\r\n_circle_ is a curved line, all points of which are equally distant from\r\nits center. _Circular_ means round like a circle. (8) By _diameter_\r\nis meant a straight line drawn from one side, or half of a circle, to\r\nthe opposite side through its center. (9) The _radius_ of a circle is\r\na straight line drawn from the center of a circle, or a ball, to its\r\ncircumference. (10) A _ring_ is a disk or object having a circular hole\r\ncut in its center. (11) An _arc of a circle_ is a part of a circle.\r\n(12) A _quarter circle_ is, of course, the one-fourth part of a circle.\r\n(13) A _tangent_ is a line which touches a curve but does not cut it.\r\n(14) An _ellipse_ is an oval figure, drawn on a plane surface. (15) The\r\n_equator_ is a circle which divides the Earth or other ball into equal\r\nparts, and is 90 degrees from the north and south poles. (16) The\r\n_ecliptic_ is a circle round the Sky in whose plane lies the orbit of\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--GEOMETRICAL FIGURES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK ALPHABET\r\n\r\nMany of the brighter stars have names, as Aldebaran, Capella, Sirius,\r\netc., but astronomers now indicate the stars of a constellation by\r\nthe letters of the Greek alphabet. The usual method is to call the\r\nbrightest star of a constellation α, that is, Alpha, the next brightest\r\nβ which is Beta, and so on, but sometimes the stars are lettered in\r\norder of position in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe following is the Greek alphabet:\r\n\r\n    α Alpha      ν Nu\r\n    β Beta       ξ Xi (Zi)\r\n    γ Gamma      ο Omicron\r\n    δ Delta      π Pi\r\n    ε Epsilon    ρ Rho\r\n    ζ Zeta       σ Sigma\r\n    η Eta        τ Tau\r\n    θ Theta      υ Upsilon\r\n    ι Iota       φ Phi\r\n    κ Kappa      χ Chi\r\n    λ Lambda     ψ Psi\r\n    μ Mu         ω Omega\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\nSTAR TESTS FOR EYESIGHT\r\n\r\nThere are a number of stars which are considered to be good tests for\r\nthe seeing power of the eyes. The faint stars of the Pleiades are a\r\nfine test of this kind; but usually these tests are double stars and\r\nwhile one will be bright and easily seen its companion will be very\r\nfaint. The test is to see the faint one, and if you can see it you may\r\nconsider you have very good eyesight.\r\n\r\nEyesight tests are given on the following pages:\r\n\r\n    Page\r\n     11--Mizar and Alcor\r\n     34--Spots on the Sun\r\n     94--Grimaldi on the Moon\r\n    119--Nebula in Orion\r\n    150--Epsilon in Lyra\r\n    150--Pleiades\r\n    182--Alpha and Beta in Capricornus\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E\r\n\r\nMAGNITUDES OF STARS\r\n\r\nThere are not nearly as many stars in the sky as you might at first\r\nsuppose. The stars are divided into magnitudes, that is, according\r\nto their brightness. Stars of the first magnitude are the brightest\r\nstars; stars of the second magnitude are second brightest, and so on.\r\nThe total number of stars which can be seen with the naked eye on any\r\none night in the United States is probably not more than 3,000. The\r\nfollowing table gives the number of stars of the different magnitudes\r\nup to and including the sixth:\r\n\r\n    Magnitudes     Number of Stars\r\n       1st                   20\r\n       2nd          about    65\r\n       3rd          about   200\r\n       4th          about   500\r\n       5th          about 1,400\r\n       6th          about 5,000\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F\r\n\r\nFIRST MAGNITUDE STARS\r\n\r\nThe brightness of a star is known by its magnitude. A star of the first\r\nmagnitude is one of the 20 brightest stars, and is 2½ times as bright\r\nas a star of the second magnitude; a star of the second magnitude is\r\n2½ times as bright as a star of the third magnitude; and so on. A star\r\nof the sixth magnitude can just be seen with the naked eye on a clear\r\nnight when there is no Moon.\r\n\r\nFifteen of the twenty first magnitude stars can be seen in our\r\nlatitude, and these are:\r\n\r\n                                      & OF\r\n        & OF STAR                CONSTELLATION\r\n\r\n     1.

They can be found, though, without\r\ntrouble, since a star of the first magnitude is located in each.\r\n\r\n_Canis Major, the Big Dog_, is a winter constellation, and can be\r\nseen on your meridian at 9 o’clock P. M. in February. Look for it in\r\nthe southern sky and you will quickly find it because of the dazzling\r\nbrightness of _Sirius_, the Dog Star.\r\n\r\n_Bootes_ (pronounced Bo-ō´-tes), the Bear Leader, is a summer\r\nconstellation, and can be seen on the meridian at 9 o’clock P. M. in\r\nJune. It is to the north of the ecliptic, or path of the Sun. It lies\r\nbetween a crown of stars and Virgo. You can’t miss it, for midway is\r\n_Arcturus_, a red star of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Lyra, the Lyre._--Is a summer constellation, and can be seen on the\r\nmeridian at 9 o’clock P. M. in August. Look for it almost overhead, and\r\nyou can’t mistake it, for three bright stars, of which _Vega_ is one,\r\nform a triangle.\r\n\r\n_Canis Minor._--The Little Dog: is a spring constellation, and can be\r\nseen on the meridian at 9 o’clock P. M. in March. It lies to the south\r\nof the constellation of Gemini, the Twins, and Cancer, the Crab. In it\r\nyou will see _Procyon_, the Little Dog Star.\r\n\r\n_Aquila, the Eagle._--Is a summer constellation, and can be seen on the\r\nmeridian in August. Look for it south of Lyra, and far to the west of\r\nPegasus. The star that put Aquila on the map is _Altair_.\r\n\r\n_Cygnus, the Swan._--Is also a summer constellation, and can be seen\r\non your meridian at 9 o’clock P. M. in September. You will find it\r\nnorth of Pegasus and east of Lyra, and in it you will see the _Northern\r\nCross_ clearly traced out with seven stars, the brightest one being\r\n_Deneb_, a first magnitude star.\r\n\r\nPiscis Australis, the Southern Fish, is an inconspicuous constellation\r\nfar south of the Equator. Fomalhaut, its brightest star comes only 20\r\ndegrees above our horizon and must be looked for when it is near the\r\nmeridian--about 9 o’clock P. M. in October.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H\r\n\r\nCOLORED STARS\r\n\r\nYou can easily notice that the stars differ in color. The following\r\nlist gives the colors of a few of the brighter stars:\r\n\r\n    WHITE STARS:  Sirius, Regulus, Vega.\r\n    BLUE STARS:   Rigel and Spica.\r\n    RED STARS:    Aldebaran, Antares, and Betelgeux.\r\n    GREEN STARS:  B Librae.\r\n    YELLOW STARS: The Sun, Arcturus, and Capella.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nDOUBLE STARS\r\n\r\nWhen two stars are very close together they form what is called a\r\n_double star_, but double stars of which the two components are really\r\nnear together in space and revolve around each other usually cannot\r\nbe resolved, that is separated, into two stars without the aid of a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nThe North Star; Rigel, Castor; Procyon and Sirius, are all famous\r\ndouble stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX J\r\n\r\nVARIABLE STARS\r\n\r\nA variable star is one whose brightness changes from time to time.\r\nA great many variable stars are known, but very few of them can be\r\nseen with the naked eye. There are different reasons given for a star\r\nvarying in brightness. Our Sun is a variable star, and we are told that\r\nthis is due to his spots. Another type of variation is perhaps produced\r\nby pulsations--the star periodically expanding and contracting. Again a\r\ndouble star formed of two bright stars which revolve round each other,\r\nas many double stars do, may eclipse one another, and this would cause\r\na change in brightness. Here, then, are three good reasons for a star\r\nbeing variable.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the _variables_ which can be seen with the\r\nnaked eye:\r\n\r\n    _Betelgeux_, in Orion.\r\n    _Alpha Cassiopeia_, that is, the brightest star in Cassiopeia.\r\n    _Beta Lyra_, that is, the second brightest star in Lyra, and\r\n    _Beta Pegasus_, that is, the second brightest star in Pegasus.\r\n    _Mira_, in Cetus.\r\n    _Algol_, in Perseus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K\r\n\r\nINVISIBLE OR DARK STARS\r\n\r\nStars are born, live and die, just like human beings. All the stars,\r\nincluding the Sun, are either in the process of making, are at their\r\nbrightest brilliancy, are dying out, or are cold and dead or have not\r\nyet become bright.\r\n\r\nProcyon and Sirius is each attended by a comparatively dark companion.\r\nProcyon and Sirius both move slowly back and forth a short distance in\r\nthe sky and this motion was attributed to the pull of satellites long\r\nbefore these bodies were discovered with the telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX L\r\n\r\nTHE EQUATION OF TIME\r\n\r\n                     TABLE OF THE EQUATION OF TIME\r\n\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n     Day of | January |February |  March  |  April  |   May   |  June\r\n     Month  |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n            |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_\r\n       1    |S  3  31 |S 13  44 |S 12  37 |S  4   6 |F  2  56 |F  2  30\r\n       6    |S  5  49 |S 14  15 |S 11  33 |S  2  37 |F  3  27 |F  1  41\r\n      11    |S  7  59 |S 14  27 |S 10  19 |S  1  14 |F  3  45 |F  0  44\r\n      16    |S  9  49 |S 14  19 |S  8  57 |F  0   4 |F  3  48 |S  0  18\r\n      21    |S 11  24 |S 13  52 |S  7  28 |F  1  12 |F  3  38 |S  1  23\r\n      26    |S 12  39 |S 13  10 |S  5  56 |F  2  10 |F  3  15 |S  2  27\r\n      31    |S 13  35 |S 12  13 |S  4  24 |F  2  56 |F  2  39 |S  3  38\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n     Day of |  July   | August  |September| October |November |December\r\n     Month  |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n            |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_ |_m_  _s_\r\n       1    |S  3  28 |S  6  10 |S  0   6 |F 10   8 |F 16  18 |F 11   3\r\n       6    |S  4  24 |S  5  46 |F  1  31 |F 11  41 |F 16  17 |F  9   3\r\n      11    |S  5  11 |S  5   8 |F  3  13 |F 13   4 |F 15  56 |F  6  51\r\n      16    |S  5  46 |S  4  15 |F  4  58 |F 14  16 |F 15  13 |F  4  30\r\n      21    |S  6   9 |S  3   9 |F  6  45 |F 15  13 |F 14  10 |F  2   2\r\n      26    |S  6  11 |S  1  51 |F  8  29 |F 15  54 |F 12  45 |S  0  28\r\n      31    |S  6  12 |S  0  24 |F 10   8 |F 16  16 |F 11   3 |S  2  55\r\n    --------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in Chapter X every day of the year is exactly 24 hours\r\nlong by our clock time. The time by the Sun is usually either ahead or\r\nbehind local clock time. The difference between clock time and Sun time\r\nis called the _equation of time_, and a table to show how many minutes\r\nand seconds the Sun is fast or slow, according to clock time, is given\r\nabove, taken from “The New Astronomy,” by Professor Todd, who has\r\nkindly permitted me to use it here. In the table =S= means that the Sun\r\nis slow, that is, that the Sun does not cross the meridian until after\r\nthe clock shows noon, and =F= means that the Sun is fast, that is, that\r\nthe Sun has crossed the meridian before the clock shows noon. =m= means\r\nminutes, and =s= means seconds above the figures.\r\n\r\nThe table gives the average values of the equation of time, which may\r\ndiffer by a few seconds from the values for any particular year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX M\r\n\r\nTHE KULLMER STAR FINDER\r\n\r\nThe star finder shown in the picture was invented by Dr. C. J.\r\nKullmer, of Syracuse, N. Y., and has been highly praised by many great\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.—KULLMER STAR FINDER.]\r\n\r\nYou should own one if possible, for you do not need to know anything\r\nabout the stars to operate it. It is mounted on the principle of a big\r\ntelescope, but it is a naked eye instrument, an arrow taking the place\r\nof the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe finder is placed on a table, or other level surface, with the\r\ndial facing north. Then the pointer and dial are set for the day\r\nand hour when you want to find the position in the sky of a certain\r\nconstellation. The indicator is turned to the name of the constellation\r\non the dial, and this also tells the direction to set the arrow.\r\n\r\nThis is all there is to it and the arrow points right at the group of\r\nstars you want, whether they are above the horizon or not.\r\n\r\nThe finder can be used for many purposes, and it is a wonderful aid in\r\nmaking out in the sky the path of the stars, Sun, Moon and planets,\r\nand when they rise and set. In fact, it is a complete observatory on a\r\nsmall scale. Its cost is only $5.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX N\r\n\r\nTHE ELLIS SEASONAL TWILIGHT CHART\r\n\r\nA useful chart, designed by Miss E. Rebecca Ellis, of Wellesley\r\nCollege, Wellesley, Mass. It makes clear the changes in the lengths of\r\nthe day, the phenomena of the seasons, etc. Its price is $1.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX O\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP FIRE SKY MAP\r\n\r\nThis map, prepared by Prof. R. S. Dugan of Princeton University, shows\r\nthe constellations as far south as the Southern Cross and is adjustable\r\nfor the time of night, date, and for the latitude. Full instructions\r\nare given for its use. It is used in many schools and colleges. It is\r\nsold by the Camp Fire Stores Co., price 19 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS OF SOME WORDS AND TERMS USED IN THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Action.= The way in which a thing works.\r\n\r\n    =Affect.= To act upon; to change; to be moved or\r\n       influenced by.\r\n\r\n    =Almanac.= A pamphlet or book containing tables\r\n       showing the days of the year; also the time the Sun\r\n       and Moon rise and set; the conjunctions, eclipses\r\n       and other information concerning the things in the\r\n       sky. The word almanac is supposed to be derived\r\n       from the Arabic article _al_ and the verb\r\n       _manac_, which means to count.\r\n\r\n    =Angular measurements.= See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n    =Aphelion.= The point where a planet or a comet is\r\n       farthest away from the sun.\r\n\r\n    =Apparent.= To seem real.

See\r\n       Molecule; Matter.\r\n\r\n    =Attract.= To pull toward. The attraction of\r\n       the Sun and the Earth for each other is due to\r\n       gravitation.\r\n\r\n    =Attraction.= A force which pulls one body to\r\n       another.\r\n\r\n    =Attraction of Gravitation.= A force which pulls\r\n       all bodies to each other.\r\n\r\n    =Auditory nerve.= A nerve that carries the\r\n       impressions of sound which reach the ear to the\r\n       brain.\r\n\r\n    =Aurora borealis.= The Northern Lights. A glowing\r\n       light effect which takes place in the Arctic Circle.\r\n       It can often be seen from our Northern States and\r\n       sometimes from the Southern States. The same kind of\r\n       lights appear in the Antarctic Circle. These Southern\r\n       Lights are called Aurora Australis.\r\n\r\n    =Axes.= Plural of axis.\r\n\r\n    =Axis.= An imaginary line on which a body turns.\r\n\r\n    =Axis of rotation.= An imaginary line round which\r\n       anything turns or spins.\r\n\r\n    =Axle.= A wood or metal rod on which one or more\r\n       wheels turn, or it may turn with the wheel or wheels.\r\n\r\n    =Badge of merit.= A badge awarded by the\r\n       organization of Boy Scouts to members who can show a\r\n       certain amount of skill in doing certain things. See\r\n       Appendix A.\r\n\r\n    =Band.= (1) A flat strip of any material, or (2)\r\n       such a strip whose ends are joined together.\r\n\r\n    =Beam.= Rays of light which are parallel. See Ray.\r\n\r\n    =Bearing.= (1) A piece of metal, or a bit of agate\r\n       or other jewel, on which a pivot, spindle or shaft\r\n       turns. (2) A direction as found by the Sun or stars,\r\n       or by the compass, sextant or other means.\r\n\r\n    =Body.= Any separate and distinct amount of matter\r\n       when held together. The Sun and Moon are heavenly\r\n       bodies.\r\n\r\n    =Degree.= (1) The 360th part of a circle. (2)\r\n       Indicated by this sign °.\r\n\r\n    =Device.= (1) An apparatus or instrument or any\r\n       part thereof. Any arrangement for producing a\r\n       given result.\r\n\r\n    =Diagram.= A sort of shorthand picture of an\r\n       apparatus or part of an apparatus. It is used\r\n       to show in the simplest and clearest manner the\r\n       construction of an apparatus.\r\n\r\n    =Diameter.= See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n    =Direct line.= A straight line.\r\n\r\n    =Disk.= (1) A circular plane or flat surface.\r\n       Since the Sun, Moon and planets seem to be flat\r\n       their surfaces are called disks. (2) Flat and\r\n       circular like a coin.\r\n\r\n    =Dog days.= So called from the fact that Sirius,\r\n       the Dog Star, rises at the same time as the Sun.\r\n\r\n    =Ecliptic.= See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n    =Elastic.= (1) A body that will stretch and return\r\n       to its original size.

(2) The stars are\r\n       called fixed because they never seem to change their\r\n       positions.\r\n\r\n    =Forecast.= A prediction of some future event.\r\n       A forecast may be founded on fancy or on fact. A\r\n       horoscope of a person is a forecast based on the\r\n       fancy of an astrologer. A weather forecast is\r\n       founded on the action of a barometer, and even then\r\n       the forecast is uncertain enough. Forecasts of the\r\n       time of eclipses, the return of comets and the like\r\n       are founded on cold scientific facts and hence come\r\n       true at exactly the calculated time.\r\n\r\n    =Frequency.= How often an event occurs.\r\n\r\n    =Gas.= That form of matter which is like air.\r\n       Some gases remain in the gaseous state at ordinary\r\n       temperatures. Gases have a tendency to expand\r\n       without limit. See Vapor.\r\n\r\n    =Generate.= To produce. To set up; as a battery\r\n       generates a current; the Sun generates power.\r\n\r\n    =Gravitation.= The force which attracts all bodies\r\n       near the Earth to it and all bodies to each other.\r\n\r\n    =Heavens.= The sky. The space as far as the eye\r\n       can see about the Earth. The space in which the\r\n       stars and their planetary systems move.\r\n\r\n    =Horizontal.= See Fig. 185.\r\n\r\n    =Horoscope.= A forecast of the future of a person\r\n       made by an astrologer who pretends to read the future\r\n       from the aspect or position of the planets and stars.\r\n\r\n    =Hyperbola.= See Fig. 129.\r\n\r\n    =Hypothesis.= See Idea.\r\n\r\n    =Idea.= A notion of a plan or scheme which may be\r\n       more or less vague. =Supposition.= A clearer\r\n       conception of a plan or scheme which is based on\r\n       such facts as may be thought of. =Hypothesis.=\r\n       A plan or scheme assumed to be true and carefully\r\n       reasoned out from all the facts obtainable.\r\n       =Theory.= A plan or scheme which has been\r\n       proved true by experiment, examination or comparison.\r\n\r\n    =Illusion.= An image which deceives the eye. The\r\n       other senses can also be deceived by illusions.\r\n\r\n    =Impact.= Coming together of two objects.\r\n\r\n    =Impress.= To form on, or to affect, as light\r\n       waves impress a dry plate.\r\n\r\n    =Indicate.= To show. To point out.\r\n\r\n    =Indicator.= That which points out or shows\r\n       something.\r\n\r\n    =Limb.= The edge of the Sun, Moon or Planets.\r\n\r\n    =Lore.= Learning on any subject.\r\n\r\n    =Lunar.= Of, or having to do with the Moon.\r\n\r\n    =Magnetic lines of force.= The direction of the\r\n       force of magnetism acting in and around a magnet.\r\n\r\n    =Magnetic storm.= The Earth is a great magnet and\r\n       sometimes when sun spots of unusual size or numbers\r\n       appear, the magnetic lines of force of the Earth are\r\n       violently affected. This is called a magnetic storm.\r\n\r\n    =Mass.= (1) Amount of matter. (2) A lot of\r\n       molecules or particles of matter brought and held\r\n       together.\r\n\r\n    =Matter.= The substance of which a thing is\r\n       formed. A molecule of matter is made up of atoms,\r\n       and a mass is a lot of molecules held together by\r\n       some attractive force.\r\n\r\n    =Mercury.= (1) The name of the planet nearest the\r\n       Sun.

B. Morse. The Morse Code is\r\n       used for telegraph and heliograph signaling.\r\n\r\n    =Motion.= Anything that changes position. There\r\n       are two kinds of motion (a) simple motion and\r\n       (b) compound motion. _Simple motion_ can be\r\n       either _translated_ or _rotary_, while\r\n       _compound motion_ is both _translated_\r\n       and _rotary_, so that while a body is being\r\n       translated, or moved through space, it is also\r\n       rotating on its axis. The Sun and planets, then,\r\n       have compound motions.\r\n\r\n    =Nature.= Everything contained in space that has\r\n       not been shaped by human hands.\r\n\r\n    =Nautical almanac.= The American Nautical\r\n       Almanac is a book of the stars published by the\r\n       Bureau of Navigation of the United States. It is\r\n       published three years in advance and is sold by the\r\n       Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C., at\r\n       30 cents per copy. This is designed chiefly for\r\n       the use of navigators of ships. It gives the exact\r\n       positions of the Sun, Moon and planets and much\r\n       other astronomical information. It is based upon\r\n       the calculations made by the United States Naval\r\n       Observatory; these are printed in the Nautical\r\n       Almanac, and on this all other almanacs are based.\r\n\r\n    =Northern lights.= See Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\n    =Obscured.= Hidden from sight.\r\n\r\n    =Official Handbook of the Boy Scouts.= A book\r\n       published by the organization of Boy Scouts and\r\n       which contains the rules and regulations of that\r\n       organization and the requirements they must meet in\r\n       order to win merit badges.\r\n\r\n    =Offset.= To equal; to balance.\r\n\r\n    =Opposition.= See Appendix.\r\n\r\n    =Optic Nerve.= The nerve that carries the\r\n       impression of light received by the eye to the brain.\r\n\r\n    =Orbit.= The path followed by a body. Atoms have\r\n       orbits as well as the stars. The paths followed by\r\n       planets and comets round the Sun.\r\n\r\n    =Parabola.= See Fig. 129.\r\n\r\n    =Parallel.= See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n    =Particle.= A bit of matter. A particle may be a\r\n       bit of matter which can be seen or it may mean an\r\n       amount so small that it cannot be seen.\r\n\r\n    =Pencil.= A group of rays from the same source of\r\n       light. See Beam. See Ray.\r\n\r\n    =Pendulum.= A body suspended from a fixed point\r\n       and free to swing.\r\n\r\n    =Perihelion.= The point where a planet or a comet\r\n       is nearest the Sun. As the orbit of a planet is an\r\n       ellipse and the Sun is in one of the foci—that is\r\n       near one end—a planet comes nearest to the Sun when\r\n       at this end of the ellipse; and when the planet is\r\n       at the other end of its orbit, it is farthest away.\r\n       See Aphelion.\r\n\r\n    =Period.= A certain interval of time which is\r\n       marked by a repeated occurrence. The period of the\r\n       Earth round its axis is about 24 hours. Its period\r\n       around the Sun is 365¼ days.\r\n\r\n    =Periodic.= Recurring regularly; as a periodic\r\n       comet.\r\n\r\n    =Perpendicular.= See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n    =Phase.= One of the peculiar aspects of a heavenly\r\n       body; as the phases of the Moon, or the phases of Venus.\r\n\r\n    =Pivot.= A pin, spindle or shaft on which a wheel,\r\n       lever or device rotates or is rotated.\r\n\r\n    =Plane.= A level surface, as a table top.\r\n\r\n    =Point.= A sharp end. A starting place.\r\n\r\n    =Pores.= Minute spaces which separate the\r\n       molecules of a substance.\r\n\r\n    =Position.= The place of a thing when compared to\r\n       the places of other things.\r\n\r\n    =Precede.= To go ahead of. That which is before.\r\n\r\n    =Precession.= The act of going ahead or preceding.\r\n       When a revolving body such as a spinning top or\r\n       the Earth is acted upon by forces which tend to\r\n       change the direction of its axis. This change in\r\n       the direction of its axis is called _precessional\r\n       motion_. The pole of the equator of the Earth\r\n       makes a complete turn round the pole of the ecliptic\r\n       in a little over 25,000 years and this change in the\r\n       direction of the axis of the Earth causes the points\r\n       of the _equinox_, that is the places where the\r\n       _ecliptic_ and the _equator_ cross each\r\n       other to move slowly from west to east and this is\r\n       termed the precession of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\n    =Prediction.= To foretell; to forecast.\r\n       Predictions may be based on fancy or founded on fact.\r\n\r\n    =Principal.= The chief one; the most important.\r\n\r\n    =Principle.= The cause of a result. That on which\r\n       a thing is based.\r\n\r\n    =Process.= (1) The way of working. (2) The course\r\n       of procedure.\r\n\r\n    =Produce.= In astronomy the word _produce_\r\n       means the lengthening of a line.
