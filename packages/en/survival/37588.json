He bent over her for a few seconds, listening as if\r\nto make sure she was alive; for this wee three-year-old was usually\r\nawake long before this, her eyes as big as saucers, and carrying on an\r\nanimated conversation with herself in lieu of any other listener.\r\n\r\nThe boy gave a kind of satisfied sigh, and drew the coverlet over her\r\nbare arm.  Then he proceeded to dress; while Bob, a beautiful, tailless\r\nEnglish sheep-dog, lay near the low hearth watching his every movement,\r\nwith his shaggy head cocked a trifle to one side, as if he had his\r\nconsidering cap on.\r\n\r\nIn summer time--and it was early summer now--dressing did not take\r\nRansey long.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened the door at last to fetch some sticks to light the fire,\r\nand stood for a moment shading his brow with his hand against the red\r\nlight of the newly-risen sun, and gazing eastwards over a landscape of\r\nfields and woods, he looked a strange little figure.  Moreover, one\r\ncould understand now why he had taken such a short few minutes to dress.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, Ransey Tansey hadn't very much to wear just then.  Barely\r\neight years of age was Tansey, though, as far as experience of the world\r\nwent, he might have been called three times as old as that; for, alas,\r\nthe world had not been over-gentle with the boy.\r\n\r\nRansey wore no cap, just a head of towy hair, which was thick enough,\r\nhowever, to protect him against summer's sun or winter's cold.  The\r\nupper part of his body was arrayed in a blue serge shirt, very much open\r\nat the neck; while below his waist, and extending to within nine inches\r\nof his bare feet, where they ended in ragged capes and promontories like\r\na map of Norway, he wore a pair of pants.  It would have been difficult,\r\nindeed, to have guessed at the original colour of these pants, but they\r\nwere now a kind of tawny brindle, and that is the nearest I can get to\r\nit.  They were suspended by one brace, a bright red one, so broad that\r\nit must have belonged to his father.  I think the boy was rather proud\r\nthan otherwise of this suspender, although it had a disagreeable trick\r\nof sliding down over his shoulder and causing some momentary\r\ndisarrangement of his attire.  But Ransey just hooked it back into its\r\nplace again with his thumb, and all was right, till the next time.\r\n\r\nA rough little tyke you might have called Ransey Tansey, with his\r\nsun-burnt face, neck, and bosom.  Yet there was something that was\r\nrather pleasing than otherwise in his clear eyes and open countenance;\r\nand when his red and rather thin lips parted in a smile, which they very\r\noften did, he showed a set of teeth as clean and white as those of a\r\nsix-months-old Saint Bernard puppy, and you cannot better that.\r\n\r\nHad this little lad been a town boy, hands and face and feet would have\r\nbeen far from clean; but Ransey lived away down in the cool, green\r\ncountry, in a midland district of Merrie England, and being as often in\r\nthe water as a duck, he was just as clean as one.\r\n\r\nAway went Ransey Tansey now, and opened a rough old door in a rock which\r\nformed part of the hill by the side of which the humble cottage stood.\r\nThe door opened into a kind of cave, which was a storehouse for all\r\nkinds of things.\r\n\r\nHe was soon back again, and in five minutes' time had lit the fire,\r\nswept the hearth as tidily as a girl could have done it, and hung the\r\nkettle on a hook and chain.  By this time another member of this small\r\nfamily came in, a very large and handsome tabby cat, with a white chest\r\nand vandyked face.\r\n\r\nMurrams, as he was called, was holding his head very high indeed.  In\r\nfact he had to, else the nice young leveret he carried would have\r\ntrailed on the ground.  Bob jumped up to meet him, with joy in his brown\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHad Bob possessed a tail of any consequence, he would have wagged it.\r\nBob's tail, however, was a mere stump, and it was quite buried in the\r\nrough, shaggy coat that hung over his rump.  But though honest Bob had\r\nonly the fag-end of a tail, so to speak, he agitated this considerably\r\nwhen pleased.\r\n\r\nHe did so when he saw that leveret.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you clever old Murrams!\"  Bob seemed to say.  \"What a nice drop of\r\nsoup that'll make, and all the bones for me!\"\r\n\r\nMurrams walked gingerly past him, and throwing the leveret on the\r\nhearth, proceeded to wash his face and warm his nose at the blaze.\r\n\r\nRansey put away the young hare, patted pussy on his broad, sleek\r\nforehead, then took down a long tin can to go for the morning's milk.\r\nHe left the door open, because he knew that if Babs should awake and\r\nscramble out of her cot, she would toddle right out to clutch at wild\r\nflowers, beetles, and other things, instead of going towards the fire.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey happened to look round when he was about thirty yards from\r\nthe cottage.  Why, here was Bob coming softly up behind.  Murrams\r\nhimself couldn't have walked more silently.\r\n\r\nHis ears disappeared backwards when he was found out, and he looked very\r\nguilty indeed.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey shook his finger at him.\r\n\r\n\"Back ye goes--back ye goes to look after Babs.\"\r\n\r\nBob lay down to plead.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't no go, Bob, I tell ye,\" continued Ransey Tansey, still shaking\r\nhis finger.  \"Back to Babs, Bob--back to Babs.  We can't both on us\r\nleave the house at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThis latter argument was quite convincing, and back marched Bob, with\r\ndrooping head and with that fag-end of a tail of his drooping earthwards\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThere grew on the top of the bank a solitary brown-stemmed pine-tree.\r\nVery, very tall it was, with not a branch all the way up save a very\r\nstrong horizontal limb, which was used to hang people from in the happy\r\ndays of old.  The top of this tree was peculiar.  It spread straight out\r\non all sides, forming a kind of flat table of darkest green needled\r\nfoliage.  Had you been sketching this tree, then, after doing the stem,\r\nyou could easily have rubbed in the top of it by dipping your little\r\nfinger in ink and smudging the paper crosswise.\r\n\r\nWhen not far from this gibbet-tree, as it was generally called, Ransey\r\nlooked up and hailed,--\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!  Are ye on board, Admiral?\"\r\n\r\nAnd now a somewhat strange thing happened.  No sooner had the boy hailed\r\nthan down from a mass of central foliage there suddenly hung what, at\r\nfirst sight, one might have taken for a snake.\r\n\r\nIt was really a bird's long neck.\r\n\r\n\"Craik--craik--crik--cr--cr--cray!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" cried Ransey, as if he understood every word.  \"Ye mebbe\r\ndon't see nuthin' o' father, do ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tok--tok--tok--cr--cray--ay!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye needn't flop down, Admiral.  I'll come up myself.\"\r\n\r\nNo lamplighter ever ran quicker up a ladder than did Ransey Tansey swarm\r\nup that pine-tree.  In little over two minutes he was right out on the\r\ngreen roof, and beside him one of the most graceful and beautiful cranes\r\nit is possible to imagine.  The boy's father had bought the bird from a\r\nsailor somewhere down the country; and, except on very stormy nights, it\r\npreferred to roost in this tree.  The neck was a greyish blue, as was\r\nalso the back; the wings were dark, the legs jet black, the tail purple.\r\nAround the eyes was a broad patch of crimson; and the bill was as long\r\nas a penholder, more or less slender, and slightly curved downwards at\r\nthe end.  [A species of what is popularly known an the dancing crane.]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral did all he could to express the pleasure he felt at seeing\r\nthe boy, by a series of movements that I find it difficult to describe.\r\nThe wings were half extended and quivering with delight, the neck\r\nforming a series of beautiful curves, the head at times high in air, and\r\nnext moment down under Ransey's chin.  Then he twisted his neck right\r\nround the boy's neck, from left to right, then from right to left, the\r\nhead being laid lovingly each time against his little master's cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Admiral, when ye're quite done cuddlin' of me, we'll have a\r\nlook for father's barge.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his elevated coign of vantage, Ransey Tansey could see for many\r\nmiles all around him.  On this bright, sunny summer morn, it was a\r\nlandscape of infinite beauty; on undulating, well-wooded, cultivated\r\ncountry, green and beautiful everywhere, except in the west, where a\r\nvillage sheltered itself near the horizon, nestling in a cloudland of\r\ntrees, from which the grey flat tower of a church looked up.\r\n\r\nTo the left yonder, and near to the church, was a long strip of silver--\r\nthe canal.  High on a wooded hill stood the lord of the manor's house,\r\nsolid, brown, and old, with the blue smoke therefrom trailing lazily\r\nalong across the tree-tops.\r\n\r\nBut the house nearest to Ransey's was some distance across the fields\r\nyonder--an old-fashioned brick farm-building with a steading behind it,\r\nevery bit of it green with age.\r\n\r\n\"So ye can't see no signs o' father, or the barge, eh?  Look again,\r\nAdmiral; your neck's a bit longer'n mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tok--tok--tok--cray!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm off down.  There's the milk to fetch yet; and if I don't\r\nhurry up, Bob and Babs are sure to make a mess on't afore I gets back.\r\nMornin' to ye, Admiral.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ransey Tansey slid down that tree far more quickly even than he had\r\nswarmed up it.\r\n\r\nScattering the dew from the grass and the milk-white clover with his\r\nnaked feet, the lad went trotting on, and very quickly reached the farm.\r\nHe had to stop once or twice by the way, however.  First, Towsey, the\r\nshort-horned bull, put his great head over a five-barred gate, and\r\nRansey had to pause to scratch it.  Then he met the peacock, who\r\ninsisted on instant recognition, and walked back with him till the two\r\nwere met by Snap, the curly-coated retriever.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like Snap,\" said the peacock.  \"I won't go a bit further.  The\r\nugly brute threatened to snap my head off; that's the sort of Snap he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer's wife was fat and jolly looking.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how's all the family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're all right, ye know; especially Babs, 'cause she's asleep.\r\nAnd we kind of expect father to-day.  But even the Admiral can't see\r\n'im, with _his_ long neck.\"\r\n\r\nShe filled his can, and took the penny.  That was only business; but the\r\nkindly soul had slyly slipped two turkey's eggs into the can before she\r\npoured in the milk.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to his home, the first thing he saw was that crane,\r\nhalf hopping, half flying round and round the gibbet-tree.  The fact of\r\nthe matter is this: the bird did not wish to go far away from the house\r\njust yet, as he generally followed his little master to the brook or\r\nstream; but, nevertheless, on this particularly fine morning he found\r\nhimself possessed of an amount of energy that must be expended somehow,\r\nso he went hopping round the tree, dangling his head and long neck in\r\nthe drollest and most ridiculous kind of way imaginable.  Ransey Tansey\r\nhad to place his milk-can on the ground in order to laugh with greater\r\nfreedom.  The most curious part of the business was this: crane though\r\nhe was, wheeling madly round like this made him dizzy, so every now and\r\nthen he stopped and danced round the other way.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral caught flies wherever he saw them; but flies, though all\r\nvery well in their way, were mere tit-bits.  Presently he would have a\r\nfew frogs for breakfast, and the bird was just as fond of frogs as a\r\nFrenchman is.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey opened the door of the little cottage very quietly, and\r\npeeped in.  Bob was there by the bassinette.  He agitated that fag-end\r\nof a tail of his, and looked happy.\r\n\r\nMurrams paused in the act of washing his ears, with one paw held aloft.\r\nHe began to sing, because he knew right well there was milk in that can,\r\nand that he would have a share of it.\r\n\r\nBabs's blue eyes had been on the smoke-grimed ceiling, but she lowered\r\nthem now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"you's tome back, has 'oo?\"\r\n\r\n\"And Babs has been so good, hasn't she?\" said Ransey.\r\n\r\n\"Babs is dood, and Bob is dood, and Murrams is dooder.  'Ift [lift] me\r\nup twick, 'Ansey.\"\r\n\r\nTwo plump little arms were extended towards her brother, and presently\r\nhe was seated near the fire dressing her, as if he had been to the\r\nmanner born.\r\n\r\nThere was a little face to wash presently, as well as two tiny hands and\r\narms; but that could be done after they had all had breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my!\" cried Ransey Tansey; \"look, Babs!  Two turkey's eggs in the\r\nbottom of the can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my!  'Ansey,\" echoed the child.  \"One tu'key's egg fo' me, and one\r\nfo' 'oo.\"\r\n\r\nThe door had been left half ajar, and presently about a yard of long\r\nneck was thrust round the edge, and the Admiral looked lovingly at the\r\neggs, first with one roguish eye, then with the other.\r\n\r\nThis droll crane had a weakness for eggs--strange, perhaps, but true.\r\nWhen he found one, he tossed it high in air, and in descending caught it\r\ncleverly.  Next second there was an empty egg-shell on the ground, and\r\nsome kind of a lump sliding slowly down the Admiral's extended gullet.\r\nWhen it was fairly landed, the bird expressed his delight by dancing a\r\ndouble-triple fandango, which was partly jig, partly hornpipe, and all\r\nthe rest a Highland schottische.\r\n\r\n\"Get out, Admiral!--get out, I tell ye!\" cried the boy.  \"W'y, ye\r\nstoopid, if the door slams, off goes yer head.\"\r\n\r\nThe bird seemed to fully appreciate the danger, and at once withdrew.\r\n\r\nRansey placed the two turkey's eggs on a shelf near the little gable\r\nwindow.  One pane of glass was broken, and was stuffed with hay.\r\n\r\nWell, the Admiral had been watching the boy, and as soon as his back was\r\nturned, it didn't take the bird long to pull out that hay.\r\n\r\n\"O 'Ansey, 'ook! 'ook!\" cried Babs.\r\n\r\nIt was too late, however, for looking to do any good.  For the same yard\r\nof neck that had, a few minutes before, appeared round the edge of the\r\ndoorway, was now thrust through the broken pane, and only one turkey's\r\negg was left.\r\n\r\nBabs looked very sad.  She considered for a bit, then said solemnly,--\r\n\r\n\"'Oo mus' have the odel [other] tu'key's _egg_.  You is dooder nor me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ransey didn't have it.  He contented himself with bread and milk.\r\n\r\nAnd so the two mitherless bairns had breakfast.\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE WOODS.\r\n\r\nI trust that, from what he has already seen and heard of Ransey Tansey,\r\nthe reader will not imagine I desire this little hero of mine to pose as\r\na real saint.  Boys should be boys while they have the chance.  Alas,\r\nthey shall grow up into men far too soon, and then they needn't go long\r\njourneys to seek for sorrow; they will find it near home.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think, reader, you and I understand each other, to some extent\r\nat all events.  Though I believe he was always manly and never mean,\r\nyet, as his biographer, I am bound to confess that there was just as\r\nmuch monkey-mischief to the square inch about Ransey Tansey, as about\r\nany boy to whom I have ever had the honour of being introduced.\r\n\r\nIt was said of the immortal George Washington that when a boy at school\r\nhe climbed out of a bedroom window and robbed a wall fruit tree, because\r\nthe other boys were cowards and afraid to do so.  But George refused to\r\neat even a bite of one of these apples himself.  I think that Ransey\r\nTansey could have surpassed young Washington; for not only would he have\r\ntaken the apples, but eaten his own share of them afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo do him justice, however, I must state that on occasions when his\r\nfather went in the barge to a distant town on business, as he had been\r\nnow for over a week, Ransey being left in charge of his tiny sister and\r\nthe whole establishment, the sense of his great responsibility kept him\r\nentirely free from mischief.\r\n\r\nNow a very extraordinary thing happened on this particular morning--\r\nRansey Tansey received a letter.\r\n\r\nThe postman was sulky, to say the least of it.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty thing,\" he said, as he flung the letter with scant ceremony in\r\nthrough the open doorway; \"pretty thing as I should have to come\r\nthree-quarters of a mile round to fetch a letter to the likes o' you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look 'ee here,\" said Ransey, \"if ye're good and brings my letters\r\nevery day, and hangs yer stockin' out at Christmas-time, I may put\r\nsomethin' in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gur long, ye ragged young nipper!\"\r\n\r\nRansey was dandling Babs upon his knee, but he now put her gently down\r\nbeside the cat.  Then he jumped up.\r\n\r\n\"I'se got to teach you a lesson,\" he said to the boorish postman, \"on\r\nthe hadvantages o' civeelity.  I ain't agoin' to waste a good pertater\r\non such a sconce as yours, don't be afeard; but 'ere's an old turmut\r\n[turnip] as'll meet the requirements o' the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed an old turnip, and well aimed too, for it caught the\r\npostman on the back of the neck and covered him with slush from head to\r\ntoe.\r\n\r\nThe lout yelled with rage, and flew at Ransey stick in hand.  Next\r\nmoment, and before he could deal the boy a blow, he was lying flat on\r\nthe grass, with Bob standing triumphantly over him growling like a wild\r\nwolf.\r\n\r\n\"Call off yer dog, and I won't say no more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ye won't, won't ye?  I calls that wery considerate.  But look 'ee\r\nhere, I ain't agoin' to call Bob off, until ye begs my parding in a\r\nspirit o' humility, as t'old parson says.  If ye don't, I'll hiss Bob on\r\nto ye, and ye'll be a raggeder nipper nor me afore Bob's finished the\r\njob to his own satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nWell, discretion is the better part of valour, and after grumbling out\r\nan apology, the postman was allowed to sneak off with a whole skin.\r\n\r\nThen Ransey kissed Bob's shaggy head, and opened his letter.\r\n\r\n  \"Dear Sonnie,--Can't get home before four days.  Look after Babs.\r\n  Your Loving Father.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all.  The writing certainly left something to be desired, but\r\nit being the first letter the boy had ever received, he read it twice\r\nover to himself and twice over to Babs; then he put it away inside his\r\nNew Testament.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, Babs!\" he cried, picking the child up again, and swinging her\r\nto and fro till she laughed and kicked and crowed with delight--\"hurrah,\r\nBabs! we'll all away to the woods.  Murrams shall keep house, and we'll\r\ntake our dinner with us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a droll procession.  First walked Bob, looking extremely solemn\r\nand wise, and carrying Ransey's fishing-rod.  Close behind him came the\r\ntall and graceful crane, not quite so solemn as Bob; for he was catching\r\nflies, and his head and neck were in constant motion, and every now and\r\nthen he would hop, first on one leg, and then on the other.  Ransey\r\nTansey himself brought up the rear, with a small bag slung in front of\r\nhim, and Babs in a shawl on his back.\r\n\r\nAway to the woods?  Yes; and there was a grand little stream there, and\r\nthe boy knew precisely where the biggest fish lay, and meant to have\r\nsome for supper.  The leveret could hang for a few days.\r\n\r\nArrived at his fishing-ground, where the stream swept slowly through the\r\ndarkling wood, Ransey lowered his back-burden gently on the moss, and\r\nlay down on his face in front of her to talk Babs into the best of\r\ntempers.\r\n\r\nThis was not difficult to do, for she was really a good-natured child;\r\nso he gave her his big clasp-knife and his whistle, and proceeded to get\r\nhis rod in order and make a cast.  Bob lay down beside the tiny mite to\r\nguard her.  She could whistle herself, but couldn't get Bob to do the\r\nsame, although she rammed the whistle halfway down his throat, and\r\nafterwards showed him how she did it.\r\n\r\nWell, there are a few accomplishments that dogs cannot attain to, and I\r\nbelieve whistling is one of them.\r\n\r\nThe fish were very kind to-day, and Ransey was making a very good bag.\r\nWhenever he had finished fishing in about forty yards of stream, he\r\nthrew down his rod and trotted off back for Babs, and placed her down\r\nabout twenty yards ahead of him, fished another forty yards and changed\r\nher position again, Bob always following close at the boy's heels and\r\nlying down beside his charge, and permitting himself to be pulled about,\r\nand teased, and cuddled, and kissed one moment, and hammered over the\r\nnose with that tin whistle the next.  Even when Babs tried to gouge his\r\neye out with a morsel of twig, he only lifted his head and licked her\r\nface till, half-blinded, she had to drop the stick and tumble on her\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"You's a funny dog, Bob,\" she said; \"'oor tisses is so lough [rough].\"\r\n\r\nOf course they were.  He meant them to be, for Bob couldn't afford to\r\nlose an eye.\r\n\r\nI think the Admiral enjoyed himself quite as much as any one.  He chose\r\na bit of the stream for himself where the bank was soft, and there he\r\nwaded and fished for goodness only knows what--beetles, minnows, tiny\r\nfrogs, anything alive and easy to swallow.\r\n\r\nI don't think, however, that the Admiral was a very good Judge of his\r\nswallowing capabilities.  That neck of his was so very, very long, and\r\nthough distensible enough on the whole, sometimes he encountered\r\ndifficulties that it was almost impossible to surmount.  Tadpoles slid\r\ndown easily enough, so did flies and other tiny insects; but a too-big\r\nfrog, if invited to go down head-foremost, often had a disagreeable way\r\nof throwing his hind-legs out at right angles to the entrance of the\r\nAdmiral's gullet.  This placed the Admiral in a somewhat awkward\r\npredicament.  No bird can look his best with its beak held forcibly\r\nagape, and the two legs of a disorderly frog sticking out one at each\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe crane would hold his head in the air and consider for a bit, then\r\nlower his face against the bank and rub one leg in, then change cheeks\r\nand rub the other in; but lo! while doing so, leg number one would be\r\nkicked out again, and by the time that was replaced out shot leg number\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIt was very annoying and ridiculous.  So the Admiral would step\r\ncautiously on to the green bank, and stride very humbly down the stream\r\nto Ransey Tansey, with his neck extended and his head on a level with\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You see the confounded fix I'm in,\" he would say, looking up at his\r\nmaster with one wonderfully wise eye.\r\n\r\nThen Ransey would pull out the frog, and the little rascal would hop\r\naway, laughing to himself apparently.\r\n\r\n\"Crok--crok--cray--ay!\" the Admiral would cry, and go joyfully back to\r\nhis fishing-ground.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes Mr Crane would swallow a big water-beetle, and if this\r\nspecimen had a will of its own, as beetles generally have, it would\r\ncatch hold of the side of the gullet and hang on halfway down.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't going another step,\" the beetle would say; \"it isn't good\r\nenough.  The road is too long and too dark.\"\r\n\r\nSo this disobliging beetle would just stop there, making a kind of a\r\nmump in the poor Admiral's neck.\r\n\r\nWhen Ransey saw his droll pet stride out of the pool and walk solemnly\r\ntowards a tree and lean his head against it, and close his eyes, the lad\r\nknew pretty well what was the matter.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like patience and plenty of it, and presently the\r\nbeetle would go to sleep, relax its hold, and slip quietly down to\r\nregions unknown.  There would be no more mump now, and the crane would\r\nsuddenly take leave of his senses with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Kaik--kaik--kay--ay?\" he would scream, and go madly hopping and dancing\r\nround the tree, a most weird and uncanny-looking object, raising one leg\r\nat a time as high as he could, and swinging his head and neck fore and\r\naft, low and aloft, from starboard to port, in such a droll way that\r\nRansey Tansey felt impelled to throw himself on his back, so as to laugh\r\nwithout bursting that much-prized solitary suspender of his, while Bob\r\nsat up to bark, and Babs clapped her tiny hands and crowed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRansey got tired of fishing at last, and made up his rod.  There was\r\nsome sort of silent joy or happiness away down at the bottom of the\r\nboy's heart, and for a moment he couldn't make out what was causing it.\r\nThe big haul of fish he had caught?  Oh, no; that was a common exploit.\r\nHaving smashed the postman with a mushy turnip?  That was capital, of\r\ncourse, but that wasn't it.  Ah! now he has remembered--father was\r\ncoming home in four days.  Hurrah! he must have some fun on the head of\r\nit.  Ransey loved to have a good time.\r\n\r\nBut, duty first.  Babs was a good little girl--or a \"dood 'ittle dirl,\"\r\nas she phrased it--but even good girls get hungry sometimes.  Babs must\r\nbe fed.  She held her arms straight out towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Babs is detting tired,\" she lisped.\r\n\r\nSo he took her up, kissed her, and made much of her for a minute, then\r\nset her against a tree where the moss was green and soft.  With a bit of\r\nstring and a burdock leaf he made her a beautiful bib; for though Ransey\r\nhimself was scantily attired, the child was really prettily dressed.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boy produced a pickle bottle from the luncheon bag, likewise\r\na small horn spoon.  The pickle bottle contained a pap of bread and\r\nmilk; and with this he proceeded to feed Babs somewhat after the manner\r\nof cramming turkeys, until she shook her head at last, and declared she\r\nwould _never_ eat any more--\"Never, never, _never_!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a turnip-field not far off.  Now Bob was as fond of raw\r\nturnips as his master.  He knew where the field was, too.\r\n\r\n\"Off ye go for a turmut, Bob; and mind ye bring a big 'un.  I'll look\r\nafter Babs till ye comes back.\"\r\n\r\nBob wasn't long gone.  He had obeyed his master's instructions to the\r\nvery letter--in fact, he had pulled more than six turnips before he\r\nfound one to please him.  [It is easy to teach a dog this trick, only\r\nstupid farmer folks sometimes don't see the fun of it.  Farmer folks are\r\nobtuse.--G.S.]  That \"turmut\" made Bob and Ransey an excellent luncheon,\r\nand Babs had a slice to amuse herself with.\r\n\r\nThe day was delightfully warm, and the wind soft and balmy.  The\r\nsunshine filtered down through a great beech-tree, and wherever it fell\r\nthe grass was a brighter green or the dead leaves a lighter brown.  Now\r\nand then a May beetle would go droning past; there were flies of all\r\nsorts and sizes, from the gnats that danced in thousands over the bushes\r\nto the great rainbow-like dragonfly that darted hither and thither\r\nacross the stream; grasshoppers green and brown that alighted on a leaf\r\none moment, gave a click the next, and hurled themselves into space; a\r\nblackbird making wild melody not far off; the bold lilt of a chaffinch;\r\nthe insolent mocking notes of a thrush; and the coo-cooing of\r\nwood-pigeons sounding mournfully from a thicket beyond the stream.\r\n\r\nHigh up in that beech-tree myriads of bees were humming, though they\r\ncould not be seen.  No wonder that under such sweet drowsy influences\r\nBabs began to wink and wink, and blink and blink, till finally her wee\r\nhead fell forward on her green-bough bib.\r\n\r\nBabs was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n\"O EEDIE, I'VE FOUND A CHILD.\"\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey took his tiny sister tenderly up and spread her, as it\r\nwere, on the soft moss.\r\n\r\n\"She's in for a regular forenooner, Bob,\" said the boy, \"and I'm not\r\nsure I don't like Babs just as well when she is asleep.  Seems so\r\ninnercent-like, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBob looked as if he really did understand, and tried by means of his\r\nbrown eyes and that fag-end of a tail to let his master know that he too\r\nliked Babs best asleep, because then no attempts were made to gouge his\r\neyes out with pieces of stick, or to ram the business end of a tin\r\nwhistle halfway down his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Bob!\" said Ransey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master,\" said Bob, raising his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Babs is a sailor's darter, ye know.\"\r\n\r\nBob assented.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she ought'er sleep in a hammock.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure.  I hadn't thought of that,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"I can make one in a brace o' shakes, and that's sailor langwidge.  Now\r\njust keep your eyes on me, Bob.\"\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey was busy enough for the next five minutes.  He took that\r\nshepherd-tartan shawl, and by means of some pieces of string, which he\r\nnever went abroad without, soon fashioned it into a neat little hammock.\r\nTwo saplings grew near, and by bending a branch downward from each, he\r\nslung that hammock so prettily that he was obliged to stand back for a\r\nlittle while to smile and admire it.\r\n\r\nWhen he lifted Babs and put her in it, and fastened the two sides of the\r\nhammock across her chest with some more string and a horse-shoe nail, so\r\nthat she could not fall out, the whole affair was complete.\r\n\r\n  \"Hush-a-bye, baby, upon the tree-top,\r\n  When the wind blown the cradle will rock.\"\r\n\r\nWell, the wind did blow, but ever so softly, and the little hammock\r\nswayed gently to and fro.  And the blackbird's voice seemed to sound\r\nmore melodiously now; the thrush went farther away; only the wild\r\npigeons continued to coo, coo, and the bees to hum, high, high up in the\r\ngreen beech-tree.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the baby slept.\r\n\r\n\"Come along now, Bob.  We've a whole hour at least.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy placed his rod and bag on the branches of a tree.\r\n\r\n\"A whole hour, Bob, to do as we likes.  No good me askin' that idiot of\r\nan Admiral to watch Babs.  He'd only begin scray-scrayin' and hopping\r\naround the hammock, and Babs would wake.  I'm goin' to run wild for a\r\nbit, are you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd off he bounded, with Bob at his heels.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral, whose feet were getting cold now, hopped out of the stream,\r\nstretched out his three-foot neck, and looked after them.\r\n\r\n\"They think they're going to leave me behind, do they?  Tok--tok--\r\ntok,\"--which in craneish language means \"No--no--no.\"\r\n\r\nSo away _he_ went next, with his head and his long neck about a yard in\r\nfront of him, and his wings expanded.  It would have puzzled any one to\r\nhave told whether the Admiral was running or flying.\r\n\r\nIf Ransey Tansey climbed one tree he climbed a dozen.  Ransey walked\r\nthrough the wood with upturned face, and whenever he saw a nest, whether\r\nit belonged to magpie, hawk, or hooded crow, skywards he went to have a\r\nlook at it.\r\n\r\nHe liked to look at the eggs best, and sometimes he brought just one\r\ndown in his mouth if four were left behind, because, he thought, one\r\nwouldn't be missed.  But even this was sinful; for although birds are\r\nnot very good arithmeticians, every one of them can count as far as the\r\nnumber of its eggs--even a partridge or a wren can.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Admiral wanted to investigate the nests, but Ransey\r\nsternly forbade him.  He might dance round the tree as much as he liked,\r\nbut he must not fly up.\r\n\r\nBob used to bark at his master as he climbed up and up.  Indeed, when\r\nperched on the very, _very_ top of a tall larch-tree Ransey himself\r\ndidn't look much bigger than a rook.\r\n\r\nYet I think the ever-abiding sorrow with Bob was not that he had not a\r\ntail worth talking about, but that he could not climb a tree.\r\n\r\nDifferent birds behaved in different ways when Ransey visited their\r\nnests.  Thus: a linnet or a robin, flying from its sweet, cosy little\r\nhome in a bush of orange-scented furze, would sit and sing at no great\r\ndistance in a half-hysterical kind of way, as if it really didn't know\r\nwhat it was about.  A blackbird from a tall thorn-tree or baby spruce,\r\nwould go scurrying off, and make the woods resound with her cries of\r\n\"beet, beet, beet,\" till other birds, crouching low on their nests,\r\ntrembled with fear lest their turn might come next.  A hooded crow would\r\nfly off some distance and perch on a tree, but say nothing: hooded crows\r\nare philosophers.  A magpie went but a little distance away, and sat\r\nnodding and chickering in great distress.  A hawk would course round and\r\nround in great circles in the air, uttering every now and then a most\r\ndistressful scream.\r\n\r\nBut one day, I must tell you, a large hawk played the lad a very\r\nmischievous trick.  Ransey was high up near the top of a tall,\r\nstone-pine-tree, and had hold of a sturdy branch above, being just about\r\nto swing himself in through the needled foliage, when, lo! the stump on\r\nwhich one foot was resting gave way, leaving him suspended betwixt\r\nheaven and earth, like Mohammed's coffin--and kicking too, because he\r\ncould not for some time swing himself into the tree.\r\n\r\nNow that hawk needn't have been so precious nasty about it.  But he saw\r\nhis chance, and went for Ransey straight; and the more the boy shouted\r\nat the hawk, and cried \"Hoosh-oo!\" at him, the more that hawk wouldn't\r\nleave off.  He tore the boy's shirt and back, and cut his suspender\r\nright through, so that with the kicking and struggling his poor little\r\npants came off and fluttered down to the ground.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey was only second best that day, and when--a sadder and a\r\nwiser boy--he reached the foot of the tree, he found that Bob had been\r\nengaged in funeral rites--obsequies--for some time.  In fact, he had\r\nscraped a hole beneath a furze bush and buried Ransey's pants.\r\n\r\nWhether Bob had thought this was all that remained of his master or not,\r\nI cannot say.  I only state facts.\r\n\r\nBut to hark back: after Ransey Tansey had seen all the nests he wanted\r\nto see, he and his two companions rushed off to a portion of the wood\r\nwhere, near the bank of the stream, he kept his toy ship under a\r\nmoss-covered boulder.\r\n\r\nHe had built this ship, fashioning her out of a pine-log with his knife,\r\nand rigged her all complete as well as his somewhat limited nautical\r\nknowledge permitted him to do.  In Ransey's eyes she was a beauty--\r\nwithout paint.\r\n\r\nBefore he launched her to-day he looked down at Bob and across at the\r\nAdmiral, who was quite as tall as the boy.\r\n\r\n\"We're going on a long and dangerous voyage, Bob,\" he said.  \"There's no\r\nsayin' wot may happen.  We may run among rocks and get smashed; we may\r\nget caught-aback-like and flounder,\"--he meant founder--\"or go down wi'\r\nall han's in the Bay o' Biscay--O.\"\r\n\r\nBob tried to appear as solemn and sad as the occasion demanded, and let\r\nhis fag-end drop groundwards.\r\n\r\nBut the crane only said \"Tok,\" which on this occasion meant \"All\r\nhumbug!\" for he knew well enough that Ransey Tansey was seldom to be\r\ntaken seriously.\r\n\r\nNever mind, the barque was launched on the fathomless deep, the summer\r\nbreeze filled her sails--which, by the way, had been made out of a piece\r\nof an old shirt of the boy's father's--and she breasted the billows like\r\na thing of life.\r\n\r\nThen as those three young inseparables rushed madly and delightedly\r\nalong the bank to keep abreast of the ship, never surely was such\r\nwhooping and barking and scray-scraying heard in the woods before.\r\n\r\nBut disaster followed in the wake of that bonnie barque on this voyage.\r\nI suppose the helmsman forgot to put his helm up at an ugly bend of the\r\nriver, so the wind caught her dead aback.  She flew stern-foremost\r\nthrough the water at a furious rate, then her bows rose high in air, she\r\nstruggled but for a moment ere down she sank to rise no more, and all on\r\nboard must have perished!\r\n\r\nWhen I say she sank to rise no more I am hardly in alignment with the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that although Ransey Tansey could easily have made another\r\nship with that knife of his, he was afraid he could not requisition some\r\nmore shirt for sails.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I ain't agoin' to lose her like that, Bob,\" said Ransey.\r\n\r\nBob was understood to say that _he_ wouldn't either.\r\n\r\n\"Admiral, ye're considerabul longer nor me in the legs and neck;\r\ncouldn't ye wade out and make a dive for her?\"\r\n\r\nThe crane only said, \"Tok!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Ransey was undressed.\r\n\r\n\"Hoop!\" he cried, \"here goes,\" and in he dived.\r\n\r\n\"Wowff!\" cried Bob, \"here's for after,\" and in _he_ sprang next.\r\n\r\n\"Kaik--kaik!\" shrieked the crane, and followed his leader, but he\r\nspeedily got out again.  The water was deep, and as a swimmer the\r\nAdmiral was somewhat of a failure.\r\n\r\nBut the barque was raised all and whole, and after a good swim Ransey\r\nand Bob returned to the bank.  Bob shook himself, making little rainbows\r\nall round him, and the boy rolled in the moss till he was dry, but\r\nstained rather green.\r\n\r\nThen he dressed himself, and looked at his watch--that is, he looked at\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bob,\" he cried, \"it is time to go back to Babs.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt was such a lovely forenoon that day that the elderly Miss Scragley\r\nthought a walk in the woods and wilds--as she phrased it--would do her\r\ngood.  So she took her little six-year-old niece Eedie with her, and\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nThe butler wanted to know if he would send a groom with her.  But she\r\ndeclined the service.\r\n\r\n\"It is ever so much better,\" she told Eedie, \"going all alone and\r\nenjoying things, than having a dressed-up doll of a flunkey dawdling\r\nbehind you carrying wraps.\"\r\n\r\nI think Miss Scragley was right.\r\n\r\nThe Scragleys were a very old family, and that was their mansion I have\r\nalready mentioned as standing high up on the hill in a cloudland of\r\nglorious trees.  But excepting Miss Scragley herself, and this little\r\nniece, Miss Eedie Moore, the rest of the Scragleys were all dead and\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThough the family estates were intact and financially secure,\r\nafflictions of all sorts had decimated the Scragleys.  No less than two\r\nhad died on the hunting-field; one, a soldier, had fallen on the field\r\nof fame in far Afghanistan; another, a captain in the royal navy, had\r\nsuccumbed to fever at sea; and still another had sailed away in a ship\r\nthat never returned.\r\n\r\nOthers had died in peace and at home.  So Miss Scragley was indeed a\r\nrelic of the past, but she was lord of the manor for the time being.\r\nHer heart was bound up in little Eedie; and the girl would have to\r\nchange her name when of age, as she would then be heir to all the\r\nScragley estates.  Even if she married, her husband must become a\r\nScragley.  It would never do to let the glorious name of Scragley die\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Scragley was somewhat antiquated though not very old; somewhat\r\nset up and starchy in manner too.  She preferred to import good people\r\nfrom London to mixing with the residents around, with the exception of\r\nthe kindly-faced, white-haired old rector, Captain Weathereye, R.N., and\r\nDr Fairincks.\r\n\r\nIn bygone ages it was currently believed that this rough old sea-dog of\r\na captain, Weathereye would lead the then graceful Miss Scragley to the\r\naltar, and the lady herself still believed that the happy event would\r\nyet come off.\r\n\r\nAnd she was quite gay when she thought of it.  At Christmas-time, when\r\nshe imported more good people from London than usual, and turned on the\r\nfamily ghost for the occasion, when she had the special brand of port\r\ndecanted that old Weathereye so dearly loved, and when Scragley Hall\r\nresounded with mirth and laughter, and was lighted up from basement to\r\nattics, Miss Scragley nursed the fond hope that the captain was almost\r\nsure to pop the question.\r\n\r\nOld Captain Weathereye praised the port.  But--well, he loved to hear\r\ncorks popping, only he wouldn't pop himself.\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Scragley!\r\n\r\n\"I wonder will he _ever_?\" she used to remark to herself, when she\r\nhad finished saying her prayers and was preparing to\r\nundress--\"ever--_ever_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never--never,\" old Weathereye would have unfeelingly replied had he\r\nheard her.\r\n\r\nOn this particular occasion Miss Scragley extended her walk far into the\r\nvery wood--forest, she romantically called it--where Ransey Tansey and\r\nhis pets were enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nShe and her niece wandered on and on by the banks of the stream, till\r\nthey came to the place where little Babs lay, still sound asleep in her\r\nhammock, and this was swaying gently to and fro in the summer wind.\r\n\r\n\"O Eedie!\" cried Miss Scragley, \"why, I've found a child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the wee darling!\" exclaimed Eedie; \"mayn't I kiss it, auntie?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you kissed it,\" said the lady, as if she knew all about babies and\r\ncould write a book about them--\"if you kissed it, dear, it would awake,\r\nand the creature's yells would resound through the dark depths of the\r\nforest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no one near,\" she continued; \"it must be deserted by its\r\nunfeeling parents, and left here to perish.\"\r\n\r\nShe went a little nearer now and looked down on the sleeping child's\r\nface.\r\n\r\nA very pretty face it was, the rosy lips parted, the flush of sleep upon\r\nher face; and one wee chubby hand and arm was lying bare on the shawl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Miss Scragley, \"I feel strangely agitated.  I cannot\r\nlet the tiny angel perish in the silvan gloom.  I must--_you_ must,\r\nEedie--well, _we_ must, dear, carry it home with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, will ye, though?\"  The voice was close behind her.  \"Just you leave\r\nBabs alone, and attend to yer own bizness, else Bob will have somethin'\r\ntill say to ye.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley started, as well she might.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, looking round now, \"an absurd little gipsy boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yes_,\" said Ransey Tansey, touching his forelock, \"and I'm sorry for\r\nbein' so absurd.  And ashamed all-so.  If a rabbit's hole was handy, I'd\r\nsoon pop in.  But, bless yer beautiful ladyship, if I'd known I was to\r\n'ave the perleasure o' meetin' quality, I'd 'ave put on my dress soot,\r\nand carried my crush hat under my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afeard, mum,\" he continued, as the crane came hopping out of\r\nthe bush.  \"That's only just the Admiral; and this is Bob, as would die\r\nfor me or Babs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Babs, you droll boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Babs is my baby, and no one else's 'cept Bob's.  And Bob and I would\r\nmake it warm for anybody as tried to take Babs away.  Wouldn't us, Bob?\"\r\n\r\nJust then his little sister awoke, all smiles and dimples as usual.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey went to talk to her, and for a time the boy forgot all the\r\nworld except Babs.\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\n\"RANSEY, FETCH JIM; WE'RE GOIN' ON.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'se glad 'oo's tome back, 'Ansey.  Has I been afeep [asleep], 'Ansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; and now I'm goin' to feed Babs, and Babs'll lie and look at\r\nthe trees till I cook dinner for Bob and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wady [lady] won't take Babs away, 'Ansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Babs, no.\"\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey fed Babs once more from the pickle bottle with the horn\r\nspoon, much to Miss Scragley's and little Eedie's astonishment and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nThen he commenced to build a fire at a little distance, and laid out\r\nsome fish all ready to cook as soon as the blazing wood should die down\r\nto red embers.\r\n\r\n\"You're a very interesting boy,\" said Miss Scragley politely.  \"May I\r\nlook on while you cook?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, mum.  Sorry I ain't got a chair to offer ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"And oh, please, interesting boy,\" begged Eedie, \"may I talk to Babs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cer--tain--lee, pretty missie.--Babsie, sweet,\" he added, \"talk to this\r\nbeautiful young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no charge for sittin' on the grass, mum,\" said Ransey the next\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nAnd down sat Miss Scragley smiling.\r\n\r\nThe boy proceeded with the preparation of the meal in real gipsy\r\nfashion.  He cooked fish, and he roasted potatoes.  He hadn't forgotten\r\nthe salt either, nor a modicum of butter in a piece of paper, nor bread;\r\nand as he and Bob made a hearty dinner, he gave every now and then the\r\nsweetest of tit-bits to Babs.\r\n\r\nEedie and the child got on beautifully together.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask you a question or two, you most interesting boy?\" said Miss\r\nScragley.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, if ye're quite sure ye ain't the gamekeeper's wife.  The\r\nkeeper turned me out of the wood once.  Bob warn't there that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure I'm not the gamekeeper's wife.  I am Miss Scragley of\r\nScragley Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was wiping his fingers and his knife with some moss.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had a cap on,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"So as I could take her off and make a bow,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"And what is your name, curious boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ransey; that's my front name.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your family name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't got ne'er a family, 'cepting Babs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have a surname--another name, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ransey Tansey all complete.  There.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do you live, my lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me and Babs and Bob and Murrams all lives, when we're to home, at\r\nHangman's Hall; and father lives there, too, when 'ee's to home; and the\r\nAdmiral, yonder, he roosts in the gibbet-tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does father do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father's a capting.\"\r\n\r\n\"A captain, dear boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he's not a boy, but a man, and capting of the _Merry Maiden_, a\r\ncanal barge, mum.  An' we all goes to sea sometimes together, 'cepting\r\nMurrams, our pussy, and the Admiral.  We have such fun; and I ride Jim\r\nthe canal hoss, and Babs laughs nearly all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're very happy all of you, and always were?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--'cepting when father sometimes took too much rum; but that's a\r\nhundred years ago, more or less, mum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor lad!  Have you a mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we has a mother, but only she's gone dead.  The parson said\r\nshe'd gone to heaven; but I don't know, you know.  Wish she'd come back,\r\nthough,\" he added with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" said Miss Scragley, patting his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't ye do that, mum, and don't talk kind to me, else I'll cry.  I\r\nfeels the tears a-comin' now.  Nobody ever, ever talks kindly to me and\r\nBabs when at home, 'cepting father, in course, 'cause we're on'y common\r\ncanal folks and outcasts from serciety.\"\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey was very earnest.  Miss Scragley had really a kind heart\r\nof her own, only she couldn't help smiling at the boy's language.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you so?\"\r\n\r\n\"W'y, the man as opens the pews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you've been to church, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; went the other Sunday.  Had nuthin' better to do, and thought\r\nI'd give Babs a treat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you go in those--clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mum, I couldn't go with nuthin' on--could I, now?  An' the\r\npew-man just turned us both out.  But Babs was so good, and didn't cry a\r\nbit till she got out.  Then I took her away through the woods to hear\r\nthe birds sing; and mebbe God was there too, 'cause mother said He was\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, boy, God is everywhere.  And where does your mother sleep,\r\nRansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep?  Oh, in heaven.  Leastways I s'pose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, where was your gentle mother buried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, at sea, mum.  Sailor's grave, ye know.\"\r\n\r\nRansey looked very sad just then.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean in the canal, surely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mum.  Father wouldn't have it no other way.  I can't forget;\r\n'tain't much more'n a year ago, though it looks like ten.  Father, ye\r\nknow, 'ad been a long time in furrin parts afore he was capting o' the\r\n_Merry Maiden_.\"\r\n\r\nThe lad had thrown himself down on the grass at a respectable distance\r\nfrom Miss Scragley, and his big blue, eyes grew bigger and sadder as he\r\ncontinued his story.\r\n\r\n\"'Twere jest like this, mum.  Mother'd been bad for weeks and so quiet\r\nlike, and father _so_ kind, 'cause he didn't never touch no rum when\r\nmother was sick.  We was canal-ing most o' the time; and one night we\r\nstopped at the `Bargee's Chorus'--only a little public-house, mum, as\r\nperhaps you wouldn't hardly care to be seen drinkin' at.  We stopped\r\nhere 'cause mother was wuss, and old dad sent for a doctor; and I put\r\nJim into the meadow.  Soon's the doctor saw poor mother, he sez, sez he,\r\n`Ye'd better get the parson.  No,' he sez, `I won't charge ye nuthin'\r\nfor attendance; it's on'y jest her soul as wants seein' to now.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, mum, the parson came.  He'd a nice, kind face like you has, mum,\r\nand he told mother lots, and made her happy like.  Then he said a\r\nprayer.  I was kind o' dazed, I dussay; but when mother called us to\r\nher, and kissed me and Babs, and told us she was goin' on to a happier\r\nland, I broke out and cried awful.  And Babs cried too, and said, `An'\r\nme too, ma.  Oh, take Babs.'\r\n\r\n\"Father led us away to the inn, and I jest hear him say to the parson,\r\n`No, no, sir, no.  No parish burial for me.  She's a sailor's wife;\r\nshe'll rest in a sailor's grave!'\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, mum, what happened that night and next day, for me and\r\nBabs didn't go on board again.\r\n\r\n\"Only, the evenin' arter, when the moon and stars was ashinin' over the\r\nwoods and deep down in the watur, father comes to me.\r\n\r\n\"`Ransey,' sez father, `fetch Jim; we're goin' on.'  And I goes and\r\nfetches Jim, and yokes him to and mounts; and father he put Babs up\r\naside me, 'cause Jim's good and never needs a whip.\r\n\r\n\"`Go on, Ransey,' sez he, an' steps quietly on board and takes the\r\ntiller.\r\n\r\n\"Away we went--through the meadows and trees, and then through a long,\r\nquiet moor.\r\n\r\n\"Father kep' the barge well out, and she looked sailin' among the\r\nstars--which it wasn't the stars, on'y their 'flection, mum.  Well, we\r\nwas halfway through the moor, and Babs was gone sound asleep 'cross my\r\narm, when I gives Jim his head and looks back.\r\n\r\n\"An', oh, mum, there was old dad standin' holdin' the tiller wi' one\r\nhand.  The moon was shinin' on his face and on his hair, which is grey\r\nkind, and he kep' lookin' up and sayin' somethin'.\r\n\r\n\"Then there was a plash.  Oh, I knew then it was dead mother; and--and--\r\nI jest let Jim go on--and--and--\"\r\n\r\nBut Ransey's story stopped right here.  He was pursing up his lips and\r\ntrying to swallow the lump in his throat; and Miss Scragley herself\r\nturned her head away to hide the moisture in her eyes.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGrief does not stay long at a time in the hearts of children.  It comes\r\nthere all the same, nevertheless, and is quite as poignant while it does\r\nlast as it is in the breasts of older folks.  Children are like the\r\ntraditional April day--sunshine and showers.\r\n\r\n\"I think, mum,\" said Ransey after a while, \"it is time for us to bundle\r\nand go.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley watched the lad with considerable interest while he struck\r\nhis little camp.  First he scattered the remains of his fire and ashes\r\ncarefully, so that there should be no danger to the wood.  Then he\r\nprepared to hide his ship.\r\n\r\n\"Did you make that pretty ship?\" said Eedie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I can make beautiful ships and boats, 'cause I seed lots on\r\n'em w'en father took me to Southampton.  Oh, that seems millions and\r\nmillions o' years ago.  And ye see, miss,\" he added, \"I'm goin' to be a\r\nsailor anyhow, and sail all over the wide world, like father did, and\r\nby-and-by I'll be rich enough to have a real ship of my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how nice!  And will Babs go with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as Babs is quite little,\" he answered, \"I can't go to sea at\r\nall, 'cause Babs would die like dead mother if I went away.\"\r\n\r\nHe had Babs in his arms by this time, and it was evident enough that the\r\naffection between these two little canal people was very strong indeed.\r\n\r\nSeated on his left shoulder, and hugging Ransey's head towards her, Babs\r\nevidently thought she was in a position to give a harangue.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly addressed herself to Eedie:--\r\n\r\n\"My bloder 'Ansey is doin' to drow a big, big man.  As big as dad.  My\r\nbloder 'Ansey is doin' to be a sailor in s'ips, and Babs is doin'.  'Oo\r\n_mufn't_ [mustn't] take my bloder away from Babs.  'Oor mudder mufn't,\r\nand noboddy mufn't.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her brother was nearly strangled by the vehemence of her\r\naffection.  But he gently disengaged the little arm and set her on the\r\nmoss once more.  He speedily enveloped her in the shawl, and then\r\nhoisted her on his back.\r\n\r\nNext he hung his bag in front, and handed the fishing-rod to Bob.\r\n\r\n\"We must all go now, lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, and we too must go.  We have to thank you for a very\r\ninteresting half-hour.\"\r\n\r\nRansey wasn't used to such politeness as this little speech indicated.\r\nWhat to say in reply did not readily occur to him.\r\n\r\n\"Wish,\" he said awkwardly and shyly, \"I could talk as nice like as you\r\nand t'other young lady.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley smiled.  She rather liked being thought a young lady even\r\nby a little canal boy like Ransey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will some day.  Can you read?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es.  Mother taught me to read, and by-and-by I'll teach Babs like\r\none o'clock.  I can read `Nick o' the Woods' and the `Rev'lations o'\r\nSaint John;' but Babs likes `Jack the Giant Killer' better'n the Bible.\r\nAn' oh,\" he added, somewhat proudly, \"I got a letter to-day, and I could\r\nread that; and it was to say as how father was comin' home in four days.\r\nAnd the postman cheeked us, and shook his head, threat'nin' like, and I\r\nthrew a big turmut and broke it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! broke his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, mum, only jest the turmut.  An' Bob went after him, and down\r\nwent postie.  Ye would have larfed, mum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you're a bad boy sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I feels all over bad--sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like bad boys best,\" said Eedie boldly, \"they're such fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Babs,\" said Ransey, \"you'll hang me dead if you hold so tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dears, I'm going to come and see you to-morrow, perhaps, or next\r\nday, and bring Babs a pretty toy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Babs,\" said the child defiantly, \"has dot a dolly-bone, all dlessed and\r\nboo'ful.\"  This was simply a ham-bone, on the ball of which Ransey had\r\nscratched eyes and a mouth and a nose, and dressed it in green moss and\r\nrags.  And Babs thought nothing could beat that.\r\n\r\nAs she rode off triumphantly on Ransey's back, Babs looked back, held\r\none bare arm on high, and shouted, \"Hullay!\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"What strange children!\" said Miss Scragley to her niece.  \"They're not\r\nat all like our little knights of the gutter down in the village where\r\nwe visit.  This opens up life to me in quite a new phase.  I'm sure\r\nCaptain Weathereye would be much interested.  There is good, in those\r\npoor canal children, dear, only it wants developing.  I wonder how we\r\ncould befriend them without appearing officious or obtrusive.  Consult\r\nthe captain, did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not speak at all, aunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you?  However, that _would_ be best, as you suggested.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley did not call at Hangman's Hall next day--it looked\r\nshowery; but about twelve o'clock, while Ransey Tansey was stewing that\r\nleveret with potatoes and a morsel of bacon, and Babs was nursing her\r\ndolly-bone in the bassinette, where Ransey had placed her to be out of\r\nthe way, some one knocked sharply and loudly at the door.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral, swaying aloft in the gibbet-tree, sounded his tocsin, and\r\nBob barked furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Down, Bob!\" cried Ransey, running to the door.  He half expected the\r\npostman.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken, however, for there stood a smart but pale-faced flunkey\r\nin a brown coat with gilt buttons.\r\n\r\nNow Ransey could never thoroughly appreciate \"gentlemen's gentlemen\" any\r\nmore than he could gamekeepers.\r\n\r\nThe flunkey had a large parcel under his arm, which he appeared to be\r\nrather ashamed of.\r\n\r\n\"Aw!\" he began haughtily, \"am I right in my conjecture that this is\r\n'Angman's 'All?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your conjecture,\" replied Ransey, mimicking the flunkey's tone and\r\nmanner, \"is about as neah wight as conjectures gener'ly aw.  What may be\r\nthe naychure of your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw!  An' may I enquiah if you are the--the--the waggamuffin who saw\r\nMiss Scwagley in the wood yestah-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the young _gentleman_\" said Ransey, hitching up his suspender, \"who\r\nhad the honah of 'alf an hour's convehsation with the lady.  I am Ransey\r\nTansey, Esq., eldest and only son of Captain Tansey of the _Mewwy\r\nMaiden_.  And,\" he added emphatically, \"this is my dog _Bob_.\"\r\n\r\nBob uttered a low, ominous growl, and walked round behind the flunkey on\r\na tour of inspection.\r\n\r\nThe only comfort the flunkey had at that moment arose from the fact that\r\nhis calves were stuffed with hay.\r\n\r\n\"Aw!  Beautiful animal, to be shuah.  May I ask if this is the doag that\r\nneahly killed the postman fellah?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the doag,\" replied Ransey, \"who _would_ have killed the postman\r\nfellah dead out, if I had tipped him the wink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw!  Well, my business is vewy bwief.  Heah is a pawcel from Miss\r\nScwagley, of which she begs your acceptance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thank you.  Dee--lighted.  Pray walk in.  Sorry my butler is out at\r\npwesent.  But what will you dwink--sherry, port, champagne--wum?  Can\r\nhighly wecommend the wum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thanks.  Then I'll have just a spot of wum.\"\r\n\r\nRansey brought out his father's bottle--a bottle that had lain untouched\r\nfor a long time indeed--and his father's glass, and the flunkey drank\r\nhis \"spot,\" and really seemed to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nRansey opened the door for him.\r\n\r\n\"Convey my best thanks to Miss Scwagley,\" he said, \"and inform her that\r\nwe will be ree--joiced to receive her, and that Miss Tansey and myself\r\nwill not fail to return the call at a future day.  Good mo'ning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mawning, I'm shuah.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the elegant flunkey lifted his hat and bowed.\r\n\r\nRansey ran in, gave the leveret stew just a couple of stirs to keep it\r\nfrom burning, then threw himself into his father's chair, stretched out\r\nhis legs, and laughed till the very rafters rang.\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\n\"OH, NO!  I'LL NEVER LEAVE 'ANSEY TILL WE IS BOF DEADED.\"\r\n\r\nThe day had looked showery, but the sun was now shining very brightly,\r\nand so Ransey Tansey laid dinner out of doors on the grass.\r\n\r\nAs far as curiosity went, Babs was quite on an equality with her sex,\r\nand the meal finished, and the bones eaten by Bob, she wanted to know at\r\nonce what the man with the pretty buttons had brought.\r\n\r\nRansey's eyes, as well as his sister's, were very large, but they grew\r\nbigger when that big parcel was opened.\r\n\r\nThere was a note from Miss Scragley herself right on the top, and this\r\nwas worded as delicately, and with apparently as much fear of giving\r\noffence, as if Ransey had been the son of a real captain, instead of a\r\ncanal bargee.\r\n\r\nWhy, here was a complete outfit: two suits of nice brown serge for\r\nRansey himself, stockings and light shoes, to say nothing of real Baltic\r\nshirts, a neck-tie, and sailor's cap.\r\n\r\n\"She's oceans too good to live, that lady is!\" exclaimed Ransey,\r\nrapturously.\r\n\r\n\"Me see!--me see!  Babs wants pletty tlothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Babs, look!  There's pretty clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThat crimson frock would match Babs's rosy cheeks and yellow curly hair\r\n\"all to little bits,\" as Ransey expressed it.\r\n\r\nAfter all the things had been admired over and over again, they were\r\nrefolded and put carefully away in father's strong locker.\r\n\r\nI think that the Admiral knew there was gladness in the children's eyes,\r\nfor he suddenly hopped high up the hill, and did a dance that would have\r\ndelighted the heart of a Pawnee Indian.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Miss Scragley that same day after dinner, as she and her\r\nfriends sat out in the great veranda, \"one doesn't exactly know, Mr\r\nDavies, how to benefit children like these.\"\r\n\r\nThe parson placed the tips of his fingers together meditatively, and\r\nlooked down at Miss Scragley's beautiful setter.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he said, slowly and meditatively, \"teaching is essential to\r\ntheir bodily as well as to their spiritual welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very prettily put, Mr Davies,\" said Miss Scragley; \"don't _you_ think\r\nso, Dr Fairincks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Miss Scragley, certainly; and I was just wondering if they\r\nhad been vaccinated.  I'd get the little one into a home, and the boy\r\nsent to a Board school.  And the father--drinks rum, eh?--get him into\r\nthe house.  Let him end his days there.  What should you propose,\r\nWeathereye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?  Humph!  Do what you like with the little one.  Send the boy to\r\nschool--a school for a year or two where he'll be flogged twice a day.\r\nHardens 'em.  So much for the bodily welfare, parson.  As to the\r\nspiritual, why, send him to sea.  Too young, Miss Scragley?\r\nFiddlesticks!  Look at me.  Ran away to sea at ten.  In at the\r\nhawse-hole, in a manner o' speaking.  Just fed the dogs and the ship's\r\ncat at first, and emptied the cook's slush-bucket.  Got buffeted about a\r\nbit, I can tell you.  When I went aft, steward's mate kicked me for'ard;\r\nwhen I got for'ard, cook's mate kicked me aft.  No place of quiet and\r\ncomfort for me except swinging in the foretop with the purser's monkey.\r\nBut--it made a man of me.  Look at me now, Miss Scragley.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley looked.\r\n\r\n\"Staff-commander of the Royal Navy.  Three stripes.  Present arms from\r\nthe sentries, and all that sort of thing.  Ahem!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the bold mariner helped himself to another glass of Miss Scragley's\r\nport.\r\n\r\n\"But you won't go to the wars again, Captain Weathereye?\" ventured Miss\r\nScragley.\r\n\r\nThe Captain rounded on her at once--put his helm hard up, so to speak,\r\ntill he was bows on to his charming hostess.\r\n\r\nHis face was like a full moon rising red over the city's haze.\r\n\r\n\"How do _you_ know, madam?  Not so very old, am I?  War, indeed!\r\nHumph!--I'll be sorry when that's done,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"What! the war, Captain Weathereye?\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Fiddlesticks!  No, madam, the _port_--if you will have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the father of these children,\" he continued, after looking down\r\na little, \"if he's been a sailor, as you say, the house won't hold him.\r\nAs well expect an eagle to live with the hens.  Rum?  Bah!  I've drunk\r\nas much myself as would float the _Majestic_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, you know,\" he presently remarked as he took Eedie on his\r\nknee; \"Little Sweetheart here and I will run over to see the children\r\nto-morrow forenoon, and we'll take the setter with us.  Anything for a\r\nlittle excitement, when one can't hunt or shoot.  And we'll take you as\r\nwell, madam.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley said she would be delighted; at the same time she could\r\nnot help thinking the gallant captain's sentences might have been better\r\nworded.  He might have put _her_ before the setter, to say the least.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNext morning was a very busy one at Hangman's Hall.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey was up betimes, but he allowed Babs to sleep on until he\r\nhad lit the fire, hung on the kettle, and run for the milk.\r\n\r\nRansey was only a boy, and boys will be boys, so he could not help\r\ntelling kind Mrs Farrow, the farmer's wife, of his luck, and how he\r\nexpected real society people to visit himself and Babs that day, so he\r\nmust run quickly home to dress.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, dear,\" said Mrs Farrow; \"and here are some lovely new-laid\r\neggs.  You brought me fish, you know; and really I have so many eggs I\r\ndon't know what to do with them all.  Good-bye, Ransey.  Of course\r\nyou'll run across and tell me all about it to-night, and bring Babs on\r\nyour back.\"\r\n\r\nBabs was a \"dooder dirl\" than usual that morning, if that were possible.\r\n\r\nRansey was so glad that the sun was shining; he was sure now that the\r\nvisit would be paid.  But he had Babs to wash and dress, and himself as\r\nwell.  When he had washed Babs and combed her hair, he set her high up\r\non the bank to dry, as he phrased it, and gave her the new doll to play\r\nwith.  Very pretty she looked, too, in that red frock of hers.\r\n\r\nWell, away went Ransey to the stream, carrying his bundle.  Bob was left\r\nto mind Babs.\r\n\r\nRansey was gone quite a long time, and the child grew weary and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Bob!\" said Babs.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Babs,\" said Bob, or seemed to say.\r\n\r\n\"Tiss my new dolly.\"\r\n\r\nBob licked the doll's face.  Then he licked Babs's hand.  \"Master'll\r\nsoon be back,\" he tried to tell her.\r\n\r\nShe was quiet for a time, singing low to her doll.\r\n\r\n\"Bob!\" she said, solemnly now; \"does 'oo fink [think] 'Ansey 'as fallen\r\nin and dlowned hisself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look, look, Bob,\" she cried the next moment, \"a stlange man toming\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\nBob started up and barked most savagely.  He was quite prepared to lay\r\ndown his life for his little charge.  But as he rushed forward he\r\nquickly changed his tune.\r\n\r\nIt was Ransey Tansey right enough, but so transformed that it was no\r\nwonder that Babs and Bob took him for a stranger.\r\n\r\nEven the Admiral must fly down from the gibbet-tree and dance wildly\r\nround him.  Murrams, the great tom-cat, came out and purred aloud; and\r\nBabs clapped her tiny hands and screamed with delight.\r\n\r\n\"'Oo's a zentleman now,\" she cried; \"and I'se a lady.  Hullay!\"\r\n\r\nRansey didn't feel quite comfortable after all, especially with shoes\r\non.  To go racing through the woods in such a rig as this would be quite\r\nout of the question.  The only occupation that suggested itself at\r\npresent was culling wild flowers, and stringing them to put round Bob's\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nBut even gathering wild flowers grew irksome at last, so Ransey got his\r\nNew Testament, and turning to Revelation, read lots of nice sensational\r\nbits therefrom.\r\n\r\nBabs was not so well pleased as she might and ought to have been; but\r\nwhen her brother pulled out \"Jack the Giant Killer,\" she set herself to\r\nlisten at once, and there were many parts she made Ransey read over and\r\nover again, frequently interrupting with such questions as,--\r\n\r\n\"So Jack killed the big ziant, did he?  'Oo's _twite_ sure o' zat?\"\r\n\r\n\"And ze axe was all tovered wi' blood and ziant's hair?  My! how nice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Six 'oung ladies, all stlung up by ze hair o' zer heads?  Boo'ful!\r\n'Oo's _twite_ sure zer was six?\"\r\n\r\n\"An' the big ziant was doin' to kill zem all?  My! how nice!\"\r\n\r\nRansey was just describing a tragedy more ghastly than any he had yet\r\nread, when from the foot of the slope came a stentorian hail:--\r\n\r\n\"Hangman's Hall, ahoy!  Turn out the guard!\"  The guard would have\r\nturned out in deadly earnest--Bob, to wit--if Ransey hadn't ordered him\r\nto lie down.  Then, picking up Babs, he ran down the hill, heels first,\r\nlest he should fall, to welcome his visitors.\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley was charmed at the change in the lad's personal\r\nappearance, and Eedie frankly declared him to be the prettiest boy she\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\nCaptain Weathereye hoisted Babs and called her a beautiful little rogue.\r\nThen all sat down on the side of the hill to talk, Babs being perfectly\r\ncontent, for the time being, to sit on the captain's knee and play with\r\nhis watch and chain.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my lad,\" said bold Weathereye, \"stand up and let us have a\r\nlook at you.  Attention!  That's right.  So, what would you like to be?\r\nBecause the lady here has a heart just brimful of goodness, and if you\r\nwere made of the right stuff she would help you to get on.  A sailor?\r\nThat's right.  The sea would make a man of you, lad.  And if you were in\r\na heavy sea-way, with your masts gone by the board, bothered if old Jack\r\nWeathereye wouldn't pay out a hawser and give you a helping hand\r\nhimself.  For I like the looks of you.  Glad you paid the postman out.\r\nJust what I'd have done myself.  Ahem!\"\r\n\r\nRansey felt rather shy, though, to be thus displayed as it were.  It was\r\nall owing to the new clothes, I think, and especially to the shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, would you like to go to school?\"\r\n\r\n\"What! and leave Babs?  No, capting, no.  I'd hate school anyhow; I'd\r\nfight the small boys, and bite the big uns, and they'd soon turn me\r\nadrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, boy!  I never could endure school myself.--What I say is this,\r\nMiss Scragley, teach a youngster to read and write, with a trifle of\r\n'rithmetick, and as he gets older he'll choose all the knowledge\r\nhimself, and tackle on to it too, that's needed to guide his barque\r\nacross the great ocean of life.  There's no good in schools, Miss\r\nScragley, that I know of, except that the flogging hardens them.--Well,\r\nlad, you won't go to school?  There!  And if you'll get your father to\r\nallow you to come up to the Grange, just close by the village and\r\nrectory, I'll give you a lesson myself, three times a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, sir!  I'm sure father'll be pleased to let me come when\r\nI'm at home and not at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? at sea?  Oh, yes, I know; you mean on the barge, ha, ha, ha!  Well,\r\nyou'll live to face stormier seas yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' father's comin' to-morrow, sir, and then we're goin' on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"He means along the canal,\" said Miss Scragley.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, to be sure.  What an old fool I am!  And now, lad, let me\r\nthink what I was going to say.  Oh, yes.  Don't those shoes pinch a\r\nbit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never wears shoes and stockin's 'cept in winter, sir.  I keeps 'em in\r\ndad's locker till snow time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, in you go to your house or hut and take them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Weathereye, when Ransey returned with bare feet and ankles,\r\n\"that's ship-shape and Bristol fashion.  Now, lad, listen.  If Miss\r\nScragley here asks you to come and see her--and I'm sure she will, for\r\nshe's an elderly lady, and likes to be amused,\"--Miss Scragley winced a\r\nlittle, but Weathereye held on--\"when you're invited to the ancestral\r\nhome of the Scragleys, then you can wear them togs and your shoes; but\r\nwhen you come to the Grange, it'll be in canvas bags, bare feet, a straw\r\nhat, and a blue sweater--and my own village tailor shall rig you out.\r\nAhem!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Weathereye glanced at Miss Scragley as if he owed her a grudge.\r\nThe look might have been interpreted thus: \"There are other people who\r\ncan afford to be as generous as you, and have a far better notion of a\r\nboy's requirements.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, Babs,\" he continued, kissing the child's little brown hand,\r\n\"I've got very fond of you all at once.  Will you come and live with\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tome wiz 'oo and live!  Oh, no,\" she replied, shaking her yellow curls,\r\n\"I'll never leave 'Ansey till we is bof deaded.  Never!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she slid off the captain's knee and flew to Ransey with outstretched\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe boy knelt on one knee that she might reach his neck.  Then he lifted\r\nher up, and she looked defiantly back at the captain, with her cheek\r\npressed close to Ransey's.\r\n\r\nWeathereye glanced towards Miss Scragley once again, and his voice was a\r\ntrifle husky when he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Scragley,\" he said, \"old people like _you_ and me are apt to be\r\nfaddy.  We will both do something for these poor children, but, bless\r\nthem, there's a bond of union betwixt their little hearts that we dare\r\nnot sever.  The bairns must not be parted.\"\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nCHEE-TOW, THE RED CHIEF OF THE SLIT-NOSED INDIANS.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the memorable visit lasted no one took much notice of\r\nRansey Tansey's pets.  Yet each one of the three of them was interested,\r\nand each showed his interest in his own peculiar way.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral had flown gracefully down from the gibbet-tree, and alighted\r\non the ground not more than a dozen yards from the group.\r\n\r\n\"Craik--a-raik--a--r-r-r--a--cray--ay!\" he said to himself, which being\r\ninterpreted seemed to signify, \"What do _they_ want here, anyhow?\r\nThat's about the same gang I saw in the woods.  Curr-r-r!  Well, they\r\nhaven't guns anyhow, like the beastly biped called a keeper, who tried\r\nto shoot my hind-legs off because I was a strange bird.  I was only\r\ntasting some partridge's eggs, nothing else.  Shouldn't I have liked\r\njust to have gouged out his ugly eyes, thrown 'em one by one into the\r\nair, caught 'em coming down, and swallowed 'em like eggs.\"\r\n\r\nAll the time the talking was going on the Admiral stood twisting his\r\nbody about, sometimes crouching low to the ground, his neck stretched\r\nstraight out towards them, the head on one side and listening, the next\r\nmoment erect as a bear pole, and seeming to look surprised and angry at\r\nwhat he heard them saying.\r\n\r\nBob had rushed to see about the setter.  He lay down at some distance\r\noff, with his nose between his paws, and the setter _set_, and finally\r\n_sat_.\r\n\r\n\"Not a yard nearer, Mr Sportsman, if _you_ please,\" said Bob; \"I'm a\r\nrough 'un to look at, and a tough 'un to tackle.  I suppose you call\r\nyourself a gentleman's dog; you live in marble halls, sleep on skins,\r\nand drink from a silver saucer.  I'm only a poor man's doggie; I sleep\r\nwhere I can, eat what I can get, and drink from bucket or brook.  But I\r\nlove my master maybe more than you love yours.  Yonder is my home, and\r\nyonder is our cat in the door of it; but my humble home is my master's\r\ncastle.  Just try to come a yard or two nearer, if you're tired of your\r\nsilly life.\"\r\n\r\nBut Dash preferred to stay where he was.\r\n\r\nMurrams the cat behaved with the utmost dignity and indifference.  He\r\nsat in the doorway washing his face, with dreamy, half-shut eyes.  To\r\nhave seen him you would have said that butter wouldn't melt in his\r\nmouth, so cool was he; yet if Mr Dash had come round that way, Murrams\r\nwould have mounted his back and never ceased clawing the dog till he had\r\nridden him half a mile at least from Hangman's Hall.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't, however, until the visitors had taken their departure that\r\nthe grand jubilee commenced.\r\n\r\n\"_They're_ gone!\" said Bob, running up and licking the pussy's ear.\r\n\"That's a jolly good job!\"\r\n\r\n\"_They're_ gone!\" said pussy in reply, as he rubbed shoulders with Bob.\r\n\r\n\"_They're_ gone!\" cried the crane, hopping madly round the pair of them.\r\n\r\nAnd as she nestled closer in her brother's arms, Babs sighed and said\r\njust the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Ransey Tansey; \"let's run off to the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's wun off to ze woods at wance,\" echoed Babs.\r\n\r\nHad little Eedie seen Ransey five minutes after this, I question whether\r\nshe would have pronounced him the prettiest boy she had ever known.\r\n\r\nRansey was himself again, old shirt, ragged pants, and all.\r\n\r\nI think that the children and Bob, not to mention the gallant Admiral,\r\nenjoyed themselves that afternoon in the woods as much as ever they had\r\ndone in their young lives.\r\n\r\nBabs insisted on taking her ragged old dolly-bone with her, and leaving\r\nthe new one at home upside down in a corner.\r\n\r\nWell, Ransey fished for just an hour, but had glorious luck and a good\r\nstring to take to Mrs Farrow.  This was enough, so he put away his rod,\r\nand read some more horrors to Babs from \"Nick o' the Woods.\"  The\r\ntorture scenes and the scalping took her fancy more than anything else.\r\n\r\nSo Ransey Tansey invented a play on the spot that would have brought\r\ndown the house in a twopenny theatre if properly put on the stage.\r\n\r\nHe, Ransey Tansey, was to be a wild Indian, Babs would be the white man,\r\nBob the bear, and the Admiral the spirit of the wild woods and ghost of\r\nthe haunted canon.\r\n\r\nThe play passed off without a hitch.  Only Ransey Tansey himself\r\nrequired to dress for his part.  This he did to perfection.  He retired\r\nto a secluded spot by the river's bank for the purpose.  He divested\r\nhimself of his pants and his solitary suspender.  These were but the\r\nevidences of an effete civilisation.  What could such things as these\r\nhave to do with the red man of the wild West, the solitary scalp-hunter\r\nof the boundless prairie?  But a spear and a tomahawk he must have, and\r\nthese were quickly and easily fashioned from the boughs of the\r\nneighbouring trees.  He tied a piece of cord around his waist, and in\r\nthis he stuck his knife, open and ready for every emergency.  He fuzzed\r\nup his rebellious hair, and stuck rooks' feathers in it; he thrust his\r\nfeet into the darkest and grimiest of mud to represent moccasins, and\r\nstreaked his face with the same.\r\n\r\nWhen enveloped in his blanket (the big shawl) he stalked into the open\r\nin all the ghastliness of his wur-paint, and said \"Ugh!\"  He was Ransey\r\nTansey no longer, but Chee-tow, the Red Chief of the Slit-nosed Indians.\r\n\r\nOn beholding the warrior, Babs's first impulse was to scream in terror;\r\nher next--and this she carried out--was to roll on her back, her two\r\nlegs pointing skywards, and scream with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried delightedly, \"'oo _is_ such a boo'ful wallio!\r\n[warrior]; be twick and tell somefing.\"\r\n\r\nFor the time being Babs was only the audience.  When she became an actor\r\nin this great forest drama she would have to behave differently.\r\n\r\nAnd now the red chief went prowling around, and presently out from a\r\nbush darted a grizzly bear.\r\n\r\nThe bear was Bob.\r\n\r\nChee-tow uttered his wildest war-cry, and rushed onwards to the charge.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly held his ground and scorned to fly.\r\n\r\n  \"Then began the deadly conflict,\r\n  Hand to hand among the mountains;\r\n  From his eerie screamed the eagle [the crane]\r\n          ...the great war-eagle,\r\n  Sat upon the crags around them,\r\n  Wheeling, flapped his wings above them.\r\n  * * * * *.\r\n\r\n  \"Till the earth shook with the tumult\r\n  And confusion of the battle.\r\n  And the air was full of shoutings,\r\n  And the thunder of the mountains\r\n  Starting, answered `Baim-wa-wa.'\"\r\n\r\nThis fierce fight with the terrible grizzly was so realistic that the\r\naudience sat silent and enthralled, with its thumb in its mouth.\r\n\r\nBut it ended at last in the victory of the red chief.  The bear lay\r\ndead, and the first Act came to a close.\r\n\r\nIn Act Two an Indian maiden has been stolen, and borne away by a white\r\nman across the boundless prairie to his wigwam in the golden East.  The\r\nred chief squats down on the moss with drooping head to bewail the loss\r\nof his daughter, during which outburst of grief his streaks of war-paint\r\nget rather mixed; but that can't be helped.  Then the spirit of the wild\r\nwoods appears to him--the ghost of the haunted canon (that is, between\r\nyou and me, the Admiral comes hopping up with his neck stretched out,\r\nwondering what it is all about)--and whispers to him, and speaks in his\r\near, and says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Listen to me, brave Chee-tow-wa,\r\n  Lie not there upon the meadow;\r\n  Stoop not down among the lilies,\r\n  Lest the west wind come and harm you.\r\n  Follow me across the prairie,\r\n  Follow me across the mountains,\r\n  I will find the maiden for you,\r\n  The maid with hair like sunshine,\r\n  Who has vanished from your sight.\"\r\n\r\nSo Chee-tow gets up, seizes his arms, and follows the spirit, who goes\r\nhopping on in front of him in a very weird-like manner indeed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Babs, knowing her part, has hidden herself in a bush, and in\r\ndue time is led back in triumph as the white man who stole the maiden.\r\nHe is tied to a tree, scalped, and tortured.  Then a fire is lit, and\r\nthither the white man is dragged towards it to be burned alive.\r\n\r\nBut another bear (Bob again) rushes in to his assistance and enables him\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nThe same fire built to burn the white man (Babs) is being utilised to\r\nroast potatoes for supper; only this is a mere detail.\r\n\r\nAnd the play ends by the spirit of the wild woods bringing the maiden\r\nback (Babs again) to the camp fire in the forest, and--and by a supper\r\nof baked potatoes with salt.\r\n\r\nAll's well that ends well.  And shortly after the denouement there may\r\nbe seen, wending its way in the calm summer gloaming up the little\r\nfootpath that leads through the green corn, the following procession.\r\nFirst, Bob solemnly carrying the fishing-rod; then Ransey Tansey with a\r\nstring of red-finned fish in front of him, and Babs on his back, wrapped\r\nin the Indian's blanket; and last, but not least, the Admiral himself,\r\nnodding his head not unlike a camel, and lifting his legs very high\r\nindeed, because the dew was beginning to fall.\r\n\r\nBabs had gone soundly to sleep by the time they reached the farm, but\r\nshe was lively enough a few minutes after this.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs Farrow made them stay to supper, every one of them, including\r\neven the Admiral, although he said \"Tok--tok--tok\" several times, out of\r\npoliteness, perhaps when first invited in.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen at the farm was in reality a sitting-room, and a very jolly,\r\ncosy one it was; nor did the fire seem a bit out of place to-night.\r\n\r\nIt took Ransey quite a long time to tell all his adventures, and dilate\r\nupon the kindness of his visitors, especially rough but kindly Captain\r\nWeathereye.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark before they got to the little cot at the foot of the\r\nhill that they called their home; and here a fresh surprise awaited\r\nthem, for a light was shining through the little window, and through the\r\nhalf-open door as well.\r\n\r\nBabs herself was the first, I believe, to notice this.\r\n\r\n\"O 'Ansey,\" she cried, struggling with excitement on the boy's back, \"O\r\n'Ansey, look! fazer [father] has tomed!  Be twick, 'Ansey, be twick.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ransey quickened his pace now, while Bob ran on in front.\r\n\r\n\"Wowff, wowff,\" he barked, \"wowff--wowff--wow!\"  But it was in a\r\nhalf-hysterical kind of way, as if there were a tear of joy mixed up\r\nwith it, joy at the hope of seeing a kind old master again.\r\n\r\nEven the crane felt it his bounden duty to indulge in an extra hop or\r\ntwo, and to shout, \"Scray--scray--scray--ay--ay!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Admiral's voice that caused honest Tom Tandy to get up from\r\nhis chair, lay down his pipe, and hurry to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hill--ll--o!\" he shouted.  \"Here we all are, Ransey Tansey, Babs, and\r\nBob, and all.  Why, this _is_ a merry meeting.  Come, Babs.  Hoist away,\r\nRansey.  Hee--hoy--ip! and there she is safely landed in harbour.  So\r\nyou missed your old father, little lass, did you?  Bless it.  But we're\r\nall going on to-morrow, and the _Merry Maiden_ has got a new coat o'\r\npaint, and new furniture for the cuddy, and it's no end of a jolly time\r\nwe'll all have.\"\r\n\r\nYes, it _was_ a merry meeting, and a right happy one.  I only wish that\r\nboth Miss Scragley and Captain Weathereye had seen it.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" the former would have said to herself, \"this good fellow could\r\nsurely never have been a slave to the bottle!\"\r\n\r\nMr Tandy had never really been a constant imbiber of that soul-killing\r\ncurse of our country--drink; but some years gone by, like many another\r\nold sailor, he was liable to slide into an occasional \"bout,\" as it is\r\ncalled, and it was with sorrow he thought of this now.  But Miss\r\nScragley and many others have yet to learn that it is often the\r\nbest-hearted and the brightest that fall most easily into temptation.\r\n\r\nAs for Weathereye, had he been a witness of this little reunion, he too\r\nwould have given his opinion about the sturdy old sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" he would have cried frankly to Mr Tandy, [pronounced Tansey only\r\nby the children] \"why, my good fellow, Miss Scragley, who is faddy and\r\nelderly, and myself, old fool that I am at the best, were considering\r\nwhat best we could do for your children.  We were to do all kinds of\r\npretty things.  The boy was going to a school, the child to a home, and\r\nyou--ha, ha, ha--you, with your bold face and your sturdy frame, a man\r\nof barely forty, were going to be sent to the house.  Ha, ha, no wonder\r\nI laugh.  But tip us your flipper, Tandy, you're a man every inch--a man\r\nand a sailor.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what Weathereye would have said had he seen Tandy sitting there\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThey are right in saying that those whom animals and children love are\r\npossessed of right good hearts of their own.\r\n\r\nAnd here was this old sailor--the word \"old\" being simply a term of\r\nendearment, for none but the sickly are old at forty, and they've been\r\nold all the time--sitting erect in his chair, Babs on one knee, the\r\ngreat cat on the other; Ransey on the hearth looking smilingly up at\r\nfather's bronzed face, silver-sprinkled hair and beard; the Admiral\r\nstanding on one leg behind the chair; and poor Bob asleep before the\r\nfire, with his chin reposing on his old master's boot.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty picture.\r\n\r\n\"Children,\" says Tandy at last, \"it is getting late, and--just kneel\r\ndown.  I think we'll say a bit of a prayer to-night.\"\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nON SILENT HIGHWAYS.\r\n\r\nIt was early next morning when Ransey Tansey ran off through the fields\r\nfor a double allowance of milk.\r\n\r\n\"Double allowance to-day, Mrs Farrow,\" he shouted.  \"Oh, yes, father's\r\ncome; and we're goin' on to-day.  Isn't it just too awfully jolly for\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to lose you and Babs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Back in a month, Mrs Farrow.  It'll soon pass, ye know.  But I--I am a\r\nkind o' sorry to leave you too, for ye've been so good to Babs and Bob\r\nand me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tear in Ransey's eye as he took the milk-can and prepared to\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\n\"The Admiral can take care o' his little self,\" he said, \"but there's\r\nMurrams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear boy, and our nipper shall go over every morning, and put\r\nMurrams's bowl of milk in through the broken pane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, now I'm happy, just downright happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, off you run.  Mind never to forget to say your prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; and I'll pray for Murrams, for the Admiral, for you, and all.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand now, and quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe world wasn't a very wide one just yet to these poor children, Ransey\r\nand Babs.  It was chiefly made up of that little cottage which went by\r\nthe uncanny name of Hangman's Hall, and of the carrying barge or\r\ncanal-boat yclept _Ye Merry Maiden_.  But when at home, at the hut, they\r\nhad all the sweet, green, flowery fields around them, the stream, and\r\nthe wild woods.  These formed the grand seminary in which Ransey studied\r\nnature, and moreover, studied it without knowing he was studying\r\nanything.  To him every creature, whether clad in fur or in feather, was\r\na friend.  He knew all their little secrets, and they _knew_ that he\r\nknew them.  Not a bird that sang was there that he did not know by its\r\neggs, its nest, or its notes; not a rabbit, hare, vole, or field-mouse\r\nthat he could not have told you the life-story of.  His was a--\r\n\r\n  \"Knowledge never learned at schools,\r\n  Of the wild bee's morning chase.\r\n  Of the wild flowers' time and place;\r\n  Flight of fowl, and habitude\r\n  Of the tenants of the wood;\r\n  How the tortoise bears his shell;\r\n  How the woodchuck digs his cell,\r\n  And the ground mole makes his well;\r\n  How the robin feeds her young;\r\n  How the oriel's nest is hung;\r\n  Of the black wasp's cunning way,\r\n  Mason of his walls of clay;\r\n  And the architectural plans\r\n  Of grey hornet artisans.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true enough that this family was poor in the eyes of the world.  I\r\nam sure they were not ashamed of it, however.\r\n\r\nThe poverty that goes hand in hand with honesty may hold up its head\r\nbefore the Queen.\r\n\r\n  \"Is there, for honest poverty,\r\n      That hangs his head, and a' that?\r\n  The coward slave, we pass him by;\r\n      We dare be poor for a' that!\r\n          For a' that, and a' that,\r\n              Our toils obscure, and a' that;\r\n          The rank is but the guinea stamp,\r\n              The man's the gowd for a' that?\"\r\n\r\nSo sang the immortal Robert Burns.\r\n\r\nBut could any boy, or girl either, be really poor who had so many\r\nfriends in field and forest, and by the winding stream?  No; and such a\r\none as this, who has been in touch with nature in his or her early days,\r\nmay grow up, grow old, but never forget the days of youth, and never,\r\nnever lose faith in Heaven and a happy Beyond.\r\n\r\nThe cottage and the surrounding country, however, did not constitute all\r\nthe children's world.  There was the ship--as I have said--the barge\r\nthat went to sea, and in which they so often sailed.\r\n\r\nFor to them as yet the barge was a brig, and the canal the ocean wide\r\nand wild.  Well, I might on second thoughts withdraw those \"wee\r\nwordies,\" _wide_ and _wild_.  The canal was not a very wide one, nor was\r\nit ever very wild, in summer time at all events.\r\n\r\nNever mind, to the imagination of Ransey, Babs, and Bob, the _Merry\r\nMaiden_ was--\r\n\r\n  \"A gallant ship, with a crew as brave\r\n  As ever sailed the ocean wave.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Merry Maiden_, I may tell you at once, was a very small\r\none indeed, and consisted--all told, that is--of the captain himself,\r\nwho was likewise cook, boatswain, and bedmaker all combined; one sturdy,\r\ngreat boy of sixteen, strong enough to lift almost any weight, Sammy by\r\nname, who was first lieutenant, supercargo, and chief engineer, and who\r\noften took his trick at the wheel--that is, he took the tiller and\r\nrelieved his captain, or mounted Jim and relieved Ransey; Ransey\r\nhimself, who was second engineer--Jim, the stout old bay nag, being the\r\nengine itself, the moving power when no fair wind was blowing; and Bob,\r\nwhose station was at the bows, and his duty to keep a good look-out and\r\nhail those aft if any other ship hove in sight or danger was near.\r\n\r\nThe _Merry Maiden_ rejoiced in one mast, which had to be cleverly\r\nlowered when a bridge had to be negotiated.  The sail was a fore-and-aft\r\none, though very full at times.  Picturesquely reddish-brown it was, and\r\nlooked so pretty sometimes against the green of the trees that, as the\r\ncraft sailed slowly on in the sunshine, dreamy artists, seated smoking\r\nat their out-door easels, often made the _Merry Maiden_ part and parcel\r\nof the landscape they were painting.\r\n\r\nI think that Tandy himself liked being on board.  The barge was his own,\r\nand carrying light wares or parcels from village to village, or town to\r\ntown, his trade.\r\n\r\nThings had gone backwards with Tandy as long as he looked upon the rum\r\nwhen it was red; he had got into debt.  But now he was comfortable,\r\njolly once more, because his keel was clear, as he phrased it; and as he\r\nreclined to-day on the top of the cuddy, or poop, with the tiller in his\r\nhand, Babs nestling near him, with the greenery of the woods, the\r\nfields, and little round knolls floating dreamily past him in the\r\nsilvery haze of the sunshine, he looked a picture of health, happiness,\r\nand contentment.\r\n\r\nRansey and Babs took their canal life very easily.  They never knew or\r\ncared where they were going to, nor thought of what they might see.\r\nEven the boy's knowledge of the geography of his own country was very\r\nlimited indeed.\r\n\r\nHe had some notion that his father's canal--he grandly termed it so\r\noccasionally--was somewhere away down in the midlands.  And he was\r\nright.  He hadn't learned to box the compass, however; and even had he\r\npossessed the knowledge, there wasn't a compass on board the _Merry\r\nMaiden_ to box or be boxed.  Besides, the ship's head was seldom a whole\r\nhour in any one particular direction.  The canal was a very winding one,\r\nits chief desire seeming to be to visit all the villages it could reach\r\nwithout being bothered with locks.  These last were few and far between,\r\nbecause the country was rather a level one on the whole.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the fact of their not knowing exactly where they were going\r\nto, or what they would see next, lent an additional charm to the\r\nchildren's canal life.  It was like the game children play on moonlight\r\nnights in Scotland.  This is a very simple one, but has a great\r\nfascination for tiny dwellers in the country, and, besides, it gives\r\nexcellent scope for the imagination.  One child blindfolds another, and\r\nleads him here, there, and everywhere, without going far away from\r\nhome--round the stackyards, over the fields by the edge of the woods, or\r\nacross bridges, the blindfolded wondering all the time where he is, but\r\nfeeling as if he were in fairyland, till at last his eyes are free, and\r\nhe finds himself--well, in the very last place he could have dreamt of\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why canal life in England should not be most\r\npleasant, and canal people just as happy as was the crew, all told, on\r\nboard the _Merry Maiden_.\r\n\r\nThe saloon of the _Maiden_, as Tandy grandly called it, was by no means\r\nvery large.  It was simply a dear little morsel of a doll's-house, but\r\nthe taste of the owner was shown in many different ways.  By day the\r\nbeds were folded up and were prettily draped with bright curtains.\r\nThere were a lounge, an easy-chair, a swing-lamp, a beautiful brass\r\nstove, and racks above and at both sides of it for plates and mugs and\r\nclear, clean tin cooking utensils; there were tiny cupboards and\r\nbrackets and mirrors, and in almost every corner stood vases of wild\r\nflowers, culled by Babs and Ransey whenever they had a chance.  And this\r\nwas often enough, for really Jim was so wise a horse that he never\r\nrequired any urging to do his duty.  He was never known to make either\r\nbreak or stumble.  But when sail was on the ship, Jim had nothing to do\r\nexcept to walk after her and look about him.  Sometimes the oats or the\r\nwheat grew close to the path, and then, although a very honest horse,\r\nJim never failed to treat himself to a pluck.  So he was as sleek and\r\nfat as any nag need be.\r\n\r\nThe weather was not always fine, of course, but on wet days Babs could\r\nbe sent below, with Bob to mind her, to play with her picture-books, her\r\nlady doll, and her dolly-bone.\r\n\r\nRansey's father had made him discard now, for ever and ay, his ragged\r\ngarments, although the boy had not done so without a sigh of regret--\r\nthey were so free and easy.\r\n\r\nHis best clothes, presented by Miss Scragley, were stowed away for high\r\ndays and holidays, and the suit his father bought him and brought him\r\nwas simply neat and somewhat nautical.\r\n\r\nLet us take a little cruise in the _Merry Maiden_.  Shall we, reader?\r\n\r\nIt will be a cruise in imagination certainly, but very real for all\r\nthat, because it is from the life.\r\n\r\nIt is very early, then, in the joyous month of June, and the _Merry\r\nMaiden_ is lying alongside a green bank.  There is no pier here.  It is\r\na country place.  Yonder on the right is a pretty little canal-side inn,\r\nthe \"Jolly Tapsters.\"  You can read its name on the sign that is\r\nswinging to and fro beneath a wide-spreading elm-tree.  Under this tree\r\nis a seat, and a table also; and on fine evenings, after their day's\r\nwork is done, honest labourers, dressed in smocks, who have been\r\nhaymaking all day, come here to smoke long clays, to talk to their\r\nneighbours, and now and then beat the table with their pewters to ask\r\nfor \"another pint, landlord, if _you_ please.\"\r\n\r\nTandy lay in here last night and left a whole lot of parcels and things\r\nat that cosy hostelry; for the country all about is an agricultural one,\r\nbeautifully wooded with rolling hills, with many a smiling mansion\r\npeeping grey or red above the trees, and many a well-tilled farm.  The\r\nparcels will all be called for in due time.\r\n\r\nThe barge-master is up before even Ransey is stirring.  He has lit the\r\nfire and made ready for breakfast.  Before going on shore by the little\r\ngangway, he stirs Sammy up.  Sammy, the sixteen-year-old boy, has been\r\nsleeping among the cargo with a morsel of tarpaulin for a blanket.  He\r\nrubs his eyes, and in a few seconds pulls himself up, and begins, lazily\r\nenough, to sort and arrange the parcels and make notes for the next stop\r\nin a small black book, with a very thick pencil that he sticks in his\r\nmouth about once every three seconds to make it write more easily.\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely morning!\" thinks Tandy, and Bob, who has come bounding\r\nafter him, thinks so too.  The sun is already up, however.  From every\r\ncopse and plantation comes the melody of birds.  Flocks of rooks are\r\nflying heavily and silently away to the distant river, where among the\r\nreeds they will find plenty to eat.  Swimming about in the canal yonder\r\nare half a score of beautiful ducks.  No, not wild; wild birds seldom\r\nbuild on a busy canal side.  They are the innkeeper's Rouens, and that\r\nsplendid drake is very proud indeed.  He lifts himself high out of the\r\nwater and claps his wings in defiance as Bob passes.\r\n\r\nYonder is a lark lilting loudly and sweetly high above the green corn.\r\nThere are linnets and greenfinches in the hedges, and warblers among the\r\nsnow-white blossoms of the may.\r\n\r\nThere is a wealth of wild flowers everywhere--blue-eyed speedwells, the\r\nyellow celandine, the crimson of clover, the ragged robin, and ox-eye\r\ndaisies weeping dew.\r\n\r\nSo balmy is the air and fresh that the barge-master has wandered further\r\nthan he had intended.  Hunger warns him to beat a retreat.  Canal\r\npeople, like caravan folks, have excellent appetites.\r\n\r\nBut here he is on board again.  Ransey has already cooked and laid the\r\nbreakfast, dressed Babs, and folded up the beds.  With the ports all\r\nopen the tiny saloon is sweet and clean.\r\n\r\n\"For what we are about to receive,\" the father begins, and little\r\nRansey's head is bent and Babs's hands are clasped till grace is said.\r\n\r\nThose eggs are fresh.  The fish was caught but yesterday.  Butter and\r\nbeautiful bread are always to be had cheap all along the canal.\r\n\r\nSammy's breakfast and Bob's are duly handed up the companion-way, and in\r\nhalf an hour after this the horse is yoked, the landlord has wished them\r\nall good luck, and they have gone on.\r\n\r\nBut the wind, though slight, is dead ahead for miles, and Jim has a\r\nheavy drag.  Jim doesn't mind that a bit.  He jingles his light harness,\r\nstrains nobly to his work, and jogs right merrily on.\r\n\r\nGradually the country wakens up to newness of life.  Smoke comes curling\r\nup from many a humble cottage; cocks are crowing here and there; and\r\nbusy workman-like dogs are hurrying to and fro as they drive cattle or\r\nsheep to distant pasture lands.\r\n\r\nThere are houses dotted about everywhere, some very close to the canal\r\nside, from the doors of which half-dressed children rush out to wave\r\nnaked arms and \"hooray\" as the barge goes slowly floating past.  To\r\nthese Babs must needs wave her wee hands and give back cheer for cheer.\r\n\r\nMany of those cots, humble though they be, have the neatest of gardens,\r\nwith flowers already blooming in beds and borders, in tubs and in boxes;\r\nneat little walks all sanded and yellow; and strings along the walls, up\r\nwhich, when summer is further advanced, climbers will find their way and\r\ntrail in their loveliness over porch and windows.\r\n\r\nThere are orchards behind many of these, the gnarled trees snowed over\r\nwith bloom, many clad in pink or crimson.  All this brings to one's mind\r\nsnatches from Mrs Hemans:--\r\n\r\n  \"The cottage homes of England,\r\n      By thousands on her plains,\r\n  They are smiling o'er the silvery brooks,\r\n      And round the hamlet-fanes.\r\n  Through glowing orchards forth they peep,\r\n      Each from its nook of leaves,\r\n  And fearless there the lowly sleep\r\n      As the bird beneath their eaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun climbs higher and higher, and the mists have disappeared from\r\nthe far-off hills, and now you can tell it is school time.\r\n\r\nWell-dressed children, in groups, are wending their way all in one\r\ndirection.  But they find time to cull wild flowers for teacher; and\r\nsee, a bold, bright-faced lad comes near to the edge of the canal.\r\nPerhaps he is charmed by the innocent beauty of little Babs.  Who can\r\ntell?  One thing we _are_ sure of--he has learned a little French, and\r\nis proud to air it.\r\n\r\n\"_Bon voyage_,\" he shouts.\r\n\r\nAnd next moment a bonnie bunch of flowers falls right into the child's\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss your hand to him, dear,\" says father.\r\n\r\nBabs smilingly does as she is told.  No actress could do so more\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\nThen the boy runs off, looking happy, and the barge floats on.\r\n\r\nBook 1--CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"POOR MARY!  SHE HAS GONE ON.\"\r\n\r\nThe barge floats on, and soon the village appears in sight.  Yes,\r\nthoroughly English, and therefore pretty: the old grey houses only half\r\nseen in the midst of the foliage; the wreaths of blue smoke; the broad,\r\nsquat steeple; wooded hills behind, and amongst these latter here and\r\nthere a tall Elizabethan house sheltering itself in a hollow, for wildly\r\nin winter do the winds sweep through the leafless oaks and elms now clad\r\nin all the glory of summer's green.\r\n\r\nThe canal makes a sweep just before it comes up to the village, as if it\r\nhad entertained some thoughts of going past without calling.  But it\r\nhasn't the heart to do so, and presently the barge is close alongside a\r\nkind of wooden platform which is dignified by the name of wharf.\r\n\r\nRansey dismounts to water his horse and slip on the nose-bag.  Then,\r\nwhile Sammy is busy with his note-book, handing out cargo and taking\r\nfresh orders, he takes delighted Babs and Bob on shore to look at the\r\nshops.  These visits to villages are much appreciated by her tiny\r\nladyship, but if the streets are steep Ransey Tansey must take her on\r\nhis back, and thus the two go on.\r\n\r\nNo fear of the \"ship\" leaving without them; and why, here is father\r\nhimself, his hands deep in the pockets of his pilot jacket, and smoking.\r\n\r\nA penny to Ransey and a halfpenny to Babs secure them additional\r\nhappiness; but in less than an hour the anchor is weighed, and the\r\n_Merry Maiden_ is once more going on.\r\n\r\nThe wind changes, or the canal, or something; anyhow sail can now be\r\nset, and Jim thinks himself about the happiest horse in all creation.\r\n\r\nOn and on through the quiet country, by the most silent of all\r\nthoroughfares, goes the barge.  Babs is getting drowsy; father makes her\r\na bed with a bundle of sacks, shading her face from the sun; and soon\r\nshe is in the land of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the breeze that blows freshly over the meadows, the day\r\nwould be a warm and drowsy one.  No fear of Sammy falling asleep,\r\nhowever, for as the canal winds in and out he has to tighten or loosen\r\nthe sheet according to the shift.\r\n\r\nJust at present the sounds that are wafted towards the barge are all\r\nlulling and dreamy: the far-off singing of birds; the sound of the\r\nwoodman's axe in the distant wood; the rattle of a cart or carriage on a\r\nroad that is nowhere visible; the jangle of church bells from a village\r\nthat may be in the sky for anything any one can tell; and now the merry\r\nlaughter of young men and maidens making hay, and these last come in\r\nsight just round the next green bend.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurs to Jim that a dance wouldn't be at all a bad idea.\r\nRansey is some distance behind his horse, when he sees him lower his\r\nhead and fling his heels high in air.  This is merely preparatory; next\r\nminute he is off at a gallop, making straight for that meadow of\r\nfragrant hay, the wind catching mane and tail and blowing it straight\r\nout fore and aft.\r\n\r\nWhen tired of galloping round the field, Jim bears right down upon the\r\nhaymakers themselves.\r\n\r\n\"That stuff,\" he says, with distended nostrils, \"smells uncommonly nice.\r\nGive us a tuft.\"\r\n\r\nHe is fed handsomely by both lads and lasses gay.  But they get gayer\r\nthan ever when Jim throws himself down on his back, regardless of the\r\nconfused entanglement of bridle and traces.  But Jim knows better than\r\nto roll on the bare ground.  He has thrown down a hay-cock for himself,\r\nand it is as good as a play to witness the girls bury him up till there\r\nis nothing to be seen of him except his four legs kicking skywards.\r\n\r\nHe gets up at last, and looks very sober and solemn.  One girl kisses\r\nhim on the muzzle; another is busy doing something that Ransey cannot\r\nmake out, but a minute or two after this, when Jim comes thundering\r\nback, there is a huge collar of hay around his neck.  Ransey mounts him\r\nbareback, and, waving his hand to the haymakers, goes galloping off to\r\novertake the barge, and throw the hay on board.  A nice little snack it\r\nwill make for Jim some time later on!\r\n\r\nTo-day Mr Tandy has bought a newspaper.  He had meant to read it, but\r\nhe is too fond of country sights and sounds to bother about it now.  In\r\nthe evening, perhaps, over a pipe.\r\n\r\nOn, ever on.  There are locks to get through now, several of them, and\r\nlockmen are seldom, if ever, more than half awake; but everybody knows\r\nTandy, and has a kindly word to say to Ransey Tansey, and perhaps a kiss\r\nto blow to Babs, who has just awakened, with eyes that shine, and lips\r\nand cheeks as red as the dog-roses that trail so sweetly over a hedge\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nThe country here is higher--a bit of Wales in the midlands, one might\r\nalmost say.  And so it continues for some time.\r\n\r\nSammy takes his trick at the wheel, and prefers to steer by lying on his\r\nback and touching the tiller with one bare foot.  Sammy is always\r\noriginal and funny, and now tells Babs wonderful stories about fairies\r\nand water-babies that he met with a long time ago when he used to dwell\r\ndeep down beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nBabs has never seen the real sea, except in pictures, and is rather hazy\r\nabout it.  Nevertheless, Sammy's stories are very wonderful, and\r\ndoubtless very graphic.  The sail is lowered at last, and the saucy\r\n_Merry Maiden_ moored to a green bank.\r\n\r\nThe dinner is served, and all hands, including Jim, do justice to it.\r\n\r\nI said the barge was \"moored\" here.  Literal enough, for a wide, wild\r\nmoor stretches all around.  Sheep are feeding not far off, and some\r\ndroll-looking ponies that Jim would like to engage in conversation.\r\nThere are patches of heath also, and stunted but prettily-feathered\r\nlarch-trees now hung with points of crimson.  Great patches of golden\r\ngorse hug the ground and scent the air for yards around.  Linnets are\r\nsinging there, and now and then the eye is gladdened by the sight of a\r\nwood-lark.  Sometimes he runs along the ground, singing more sweetly\r\neven than his brother musician who loves to soar as high as the clouds.\r\n\r\nHere is a cock-robin, looking very independent and lilting defiance at\r\neverybody.  Robins do not always live close to civilisation.  This robin\r\ncomes close enough to pick up the crumbs which Ransey throws towards\r\nhim.  He wants Ransey to believe that all the country for miles and\r\nmiles around belongs to him--Cock-Robin--and that no bird save him has\r\nany real business here.\r\n\r\nThere are pine-trees waving on the hills yonder, and down below, a town\r\nmuch bigger than any they yet have arrived at.\r\n\r\nBut see, there is a storm coming up astern, so, speedily now, the _Merry\r\nMaiden_ is once more under way.\r\n\r\nBabs is bundled down below, and Bob goes with her.\r\n\r\nPresently the air is chilly enough to make one shiver.  A puff of high\r\nwind, a squall we may call it, brings up an army of clouds and darkness.\r\nThunder rolls, and the swift lightning flashes--red, bright, intense--\r\nthen down come the rain and the big white hailstones.  These rattle so\r\nloudly on the poop deck, and on the great tarpaulin that covers the\r\ncargo, that for a time the thunder itself can scarcely be heard.\r\n\r\nBut in twenty minutes' time the sun is once more shining, the clouds\r\nhave rolled far to leeward, the deck is dry, and but for the pools of\r\nwater that lie in the hollows of the hard tarpaulin, no evidence is left\r\nthat a summer storm had been raging.\r\n\r\nBut away with the storm has gone the wind itself, and Jim is once more\r\ncalled into requisition.  Then onwards floats the barge.\r\n\r\nThrough many a bridge and lock, past many a hamlet, past woodlands and\r\norchards, and fields of waving wheat, stopping only now and then at a\r\nvillage, till at last, and just as the sun is westering, the distant\r\ntown is reached.\r\n\r\nOh, a most unsavoury sort of a place, a most objectionable kind of a\r\nwharf, at which to pass a night.\r\n\r\nTandy sends Babs and Bob below again; for a language is spoken here he\r\ndoes not wish the child to listen to, sights may be seen he would not\r\nthat her eyes should dwell upon.  Yonder is an ugly public-house with\r\nbroken windows in it, and a bloated-faced, bare-armed woman, the\r\nlandlady, standing with arms akimbo defiantly in the doorway.  Ah! there\r\nwas a time when Tandy used to spend hours in that very house.  He\r\nshudders to think of it now.\r\n\r\nThere is one dead tree at the gable of this inn, which--half a century\r\nago, perhaps--may have been a country hostelry surrounded by meadows and\r\nhedges.  That tree would then be green, the air fresh and sweet around\r\nit, the mavis singing in its leafy shade.  Now the sky is lurid, the air\r\nis tainted, and there is smoke everywhere.  Not even the bark is left on\r\nthe ghastly tree.  It looks as if it had died of leprosy.\r\n\r\nBut the work is hurried through, and in a comparatively short time the\r\n_Merry Maiden_ is away out in the green quiet country.\r\n\r\nWhat a blessed change from the awful town they have just left!\r\n\r\nThe sun has already gone down in such a glory of crimson, bronze, and\r\norange, as we in this country seldom see.\r\n\r\nThis soon fades away, however, as everything that is beautiful to behold\r\nmust fade.\r\n\r\nThe stars come out now in the east, and just as gloaming is merging into\r\nnight the boat draws near to a little canal-side inn, and Jim, the\r\nhorse, who is wiser far than many a professed Christian, stops of his\r\nown accord.\r\n\r\nFor Ransey had gone to sleep--oh, he often rode thus and never fell.  He\r\nawakes now, however, with a start, and gazes wonderingly around him.\r\nHis eyes fall upon the sign.  And there, in large white letters, the boy\r\ncan read easily enough though the light is fading--the \"Bargee's\r\nChorus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd not only could he read, but he could remember: it was here they lay\r\nthat sad, sad night--what a long time ago it seemed--when mother died.\r\n\r\nHere was the landlord himself with his big apron on, a burly fellow with\r\na kindly face, and as Tandy stepped on shore he was welcomed with a\r\nhearty handshake.\r\n\r\n\"Ah: Cap'en Tandy, and 'ow's you.  And here is Ransey Tansey, bright and\r\nbobbish, and little Babs, and Bob, and everybody.  How nice you all\r\nlook!  But la!\" he added, \"it do seem such a long, long time since you\r\nwere here before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've not had the heart to come much this way, Mr Shirley.  I've been\r\ntrading at the southern end o' the canal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ye've never been here once since you put up the bit of marble slab\r\nto mark the spot where _she_ lies?\"\r\n\r\nRansey knew his mother was referred to, and turned aside to hide the\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Never since,\" says Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, cap'en, many's the one as asks me about that slab.  And the old\r\nsquire himself stopped here one day and got all the story from me.  And\r\nwhen I'd finished, never a word he said.  He just heaved a biggish sort\r\nof a sigh, and went trotting on.\r\n\r\n\"But come in, Ransey, Babs, and Bob, and all.  The night's going to be\r\nchilly, and an air of the fire will do the children good.\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, just take the horse round to the stable.  We'll have a bit o'\r\nfrost to-night, I thinks.\"\r\n\r\nRansey runs on board for a few minutes to touch up the fire, put on the\r\nguard, and make down the beds; then he joins the group around the cosy\r\nparlour fire.\r\n\r\nThe kindly landlady, as plump and rosy as her husband, makes very much\r\nof the children, and the supper she places before them is a right hearty\r\none, nor is Bob himself forgotten.\r\n\r\nA very quiet and pleasant evening is spent, then good-nights are said,\r\nand the seafaring folks, as they humorously call themselves, go on board\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nSammy is already sound asleep beneath the tarpaulin, and Ransey takes\r\nhis little sister below to bed at once.\r\n\r\nBut father stops on deck a little while, to think and muse.\r\n\r\nHow still the night is!  Not a breath of wind now; not a sound save the\r\ndistant melancholy hooting of an owl as he flies low across the fields,\r\nthe champ-champing of the horse in the stable, and an occasional plash\r\nin the canal as some great frog leaps off the bank.\r\n\r\nNothing more.\r\n\r\nBut high above shine God's holy stars.  There may be melancholy in the\r\nold sailor's heart as he gazes skywards, but there is hope as well, for\r\nthese little points of dazzling light bear his thoughts away to better\r\nworlds than this.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is early morning again, and soon the barge is well on its way.\r\n\r\nBut when it is stopped in the middle of a somewhat lonesome moor, and\r\nTandy takes his children on shore, the boy knows right well where they\r\nare going, though innocent little Babs doesn't.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" he says presently, as they are near to a clump of tall trees,\r\n\"isn't it just _here_ where mother was laid?\"\r\n\r\nThe rough weather-beaten old sailor uncovers his head.\r\n\r\nHe points to a spot of the canal that is gleaming bright in the rays of\r\nthe morning sun.\r\n\r\n\"Just down there, dear boy,\" he says.  \"The coffin was leaded; it could\r\nnever rise.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words are spoken apparently to himself, as he turns sadly away\r\ntowards the trees.\r\n\r\nStill holding Ransey's hand, and with Babs in his arms, he points to the\r\ntallest, strongest tree of all.  It is a beautiful beech.\r\n\r\nAnd there, about eight feet from the ground, and evidently let deeply\r\ninto the tree, is a small and lettered slab of marble.\r\n\r\nThe bark has begun to curl in a rough lip over its edge all round as if\r\nto hold it more firmly in its place.\r\n\r\n  POOR MARY.\r\n  She has gone on.\r\n  _Feby. 19th--82_.\r\n\r\nThe letters were not over-well formed.  Perhaps they were cut by Tandy's\r\nown hand.  What mattered it?  The little tablet was meant but for _his_\r\neyes.  Simplicity is best.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Mary!  She has gone on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the words are written not only there upon the marble, but upon the\r\nhonest sailor's heart.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEnd of Book One.\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\n\"JUST THREE YEARS SINCE RANSEY WENT TO SEA.\"\r\n\r\n\"O father,\" said Babs one autumn evening, \"aren't _you_ frightened at\r\nthe roaring of the sea?\"\r\n\r\nTandy and his child were sitting together, that autumn evening, in the\r\nbest parlour.  They were waiting for the postman to come round the\r\ncorner; and as the waves were making a clean breach over the black,\r\nsmooth rocks down yonder, and the spray was dashing high over the road\r\nand rattling like hail upon the panes of glass in the little cottage\r\nwindow, the postman would be wearing his waterproof cape to-night to\r\nkeep the letters dry.\r\n\r\nBabs had been watching for a man in a glittering oilskin, very\r\nanxiously, too, with her little face close to the glass, when a bigger\r\nwave than any she had yet seen rolled green and spumy and swiftly across\r\nthe boulders, till meeting the resistance offered by the cliff it rose\r\ninto the air for twenty feet at least, then broke like a waterfall on\r\nthe asphalt path which was dignified by the name of esplanade.\r\n\r\nNo wonder she rushed back from the window, and now stood trembling by\r\nher father's side.\r\n\r\nHe took her gently on his knee.\r\n\r\nThough five years have elapsed since the night they had visited mother's\r\ntree, and she is now eight years of age, she is but a little thing.  Ay,\r\nand fragile.\r\n\r\nAs she sits there, with one arm about his neck, he looks at her, and\r\ntalks to her tenderly.  She has her mother's eyes.\r\n\r\nBut how lonely he would be, he cannot help thinking, if anything\r\nhappened to his little Nelda--to Babs.  The thought causes him to shiver\r\nas he sits there in his easy-chair by the fire, for chill is the breeze\r\nthat blows from off the sea to-night.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, when it comes, will make it just three years since Ransey\r\nwent to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three years?  Yes, Babs, so it will.  Oh, how quickly the time has\r\nflown!  And how good your memory is, darling!\"\r\n\r\n\"Flown quickly, father?  Oh, I think every one of those years has been\r\nmuch, much longer than the other.  And I think,\" she added, \"lazy postie\r\nwill never come to-night.  But I dreamt, daddy, we would have a letter\r\nfrom Ransey, and it is sure to come.\"\r\n\r\nThree years.  Yes, and years do fly fast away when men or women get\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\nThose years though--ay, and the whole five--had been very busy ones with\r\nRansey Tansey, very eventful, I might almost say.\r\n\r\nOld Captain Weathereye had proved a right good friend to Ransey.  Nor\r\ndid he take the least degree of credit to himself for being so.\r\n\r\n\"The boy has got the grit in him,\" he told Miss Scragley, \"and just a\r\nspice of the devil; and without that, I can assure you, madam, no boy is\r\ngoing to get well on in this world.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley didn't care to swallow this doctrine quite; but Eedie,\r\nwhom Ransey looked upon as a kind of fairy, or goddess, immeasurably\r\nbetter than himself, took the captain's view of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she astonished Miss Scragley by exclaiming, \"the devil is\r\neverywhere, auntie.  Mr Smith himself said so in the church.  He is in\r\nroaring lions and in lambs when they lie down together, and in little\r\nboys, and then they are best and funniest.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scragley sighed.\r\n\r\n\"It is a world of sin and sorrow,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"A world of fiddlesticks, madam!\" cried Weathereye.  \"I tell you, it is\r\na splendid world, a grand old world; but you've got to learn how to take\r\nyour own part in it.  Take my word for it, Miss Scragley, the world\r\nwasn't made for fools.  Fools have got to take a back seat, and just\r\nlook on, while men of grit do the work and enjoy the reward.  Ahem!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to make a man of that lad,\" he went on, \"and, what's more, I'm\r\ndoing it.  He needs holy-stoning--I'm holy-stoning him.  He may want a\r\nlittle polishing after, but rubbing against the world will do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're very good, Captain Weathereye; you will be rewarded, if not in\r\nthis world, in the next--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut--tut--tut,\" cried the old sailor impatiently, and it must be\r\nadmitted somewhat brusquely, \"women folks will talk, especially when\r\nthey don't know what to say; but pray keep such sentiments and\r\nplatitudes as these for your next Dorcas meeting, madam.  Reward,\r\nindeed!  Next world, forsooth!  I tell you that I'm having it in _this_.\r\nI live my own early days over again in the boy's youth.  It is moral\r\nmeat and drink for the old--well, the middle-aged, like myself, ahem!--\r\nto mingle with the young and get interested, not so much in their\r\npursuits, because one's joints are too stiff for that, but in their\r\nhopes and aspirations for the future which is all before them.  Ever\r\nhear these lines, Miss Scragley?\r\n\r\n  \"`In the lexicon of youth\r\n  That fate reserves for a bright manhood,\r\n  There is no such word as fail.'\r\n\r\n\"I'd have them printed on the front page of every copybook laid before a\r\nchild in school, and I'd have him to learn them as soon as he can lisp.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWell, right happy years these had been for Ransey Tansey, and little\r\nBabs as well, to say nothing of gentle Eedie.  As the world began to\r\nsmile upon Tandy himself, he tried to do all he could for his children's\r\ncomfort.  Even the little cottage at the foot of the hill was made more\r\nship-shape, and furnished with many a comfort it had previously lacked.\r\n\r\nTandy was a man of a speculative turn of mind, and moreover inventive.\r\nHis speculations, however, did not succeed so well as he could have\r\nwished.  I am never sorry for the downfall of speculators; for, after\r\nall, what is speculation but a species of gambling--gambling for high\r\nstakes?  And supposing that a man wins, which once in a way he may;\r\nsupposing even that he is strong enough in pocket to establish a\r\n\"corner,\" as it is called in Yankee-land, to buy up the whole of some\r\ngreat commodity, and shut it up until the people are starving for it and\r\nglad to pay for it at three times the original value, well, the corner\r\nknight becomes a millionaire.  Yes; and very often a miser, and\r\nmiserable at that.  Can a millionaire enjoy sport or play any better\r\nthan you or I, reader?  No, nor so much.\r\n\r\nHas he a better appetite from the fact that he can afford to coax it\r\nwith every costly dainty that cash can purchase?  More likely a worse.\r\n\r\nIs he more healthy?  That were impossible.\r\n\r\nIs he more happy?  Ah, here we come to the test question.  Well, he can\r\nhave a larger and a finer house than most people, and it may be\r\nfurnished like a palace.  Pictures of the old masters may adorn its\r\nwalls; musical instruments of rare value, works of art and vertu, may\r\nmeet the eye at every turn; the gardens, and rose lawns, and\r\nconservatories may be more gorgeous than the dream of an Eastern prince.\r\nBut can he live in more than one room at a time, or enjoy anything\r\naround him a bit better than the friends do whom he invites to his home\r\nthat they may admire everything and envy _him_?\r\n\r\nBut even the millionaire tires of home.  He is satiated with the good\r\nthings his gold has brought him; and if he travels abroad he will not\r\nfind half the enjoyment in those beauties of nature--which even the\r\nmillionaire's gold cannot deprive the poorest man of--that the poet or\r\nthe naturalist does.\r\n\r\nI think there is one thing that most of us have to be thankful for--\r\nnamely, that we are not over-ambitious, and have no desire to become\r\nmillionaires.\r\n\r\nYes, but Tandy's ambition was not a morbid one; it was not selfish.  He\r\nfelt that he could die contentedly enough, could he make as sure as any\r\none can be sure that his boy and girl would not become waifs and strays\r\non the great highway of life.\r\n\r\nHow to make sure?  That had been the question he had tried to answer\r\nmany and many a time as he lay on the poop of his little craft and\r\nsailed slowly through the meadows and moors.\r\n\r\nI have said he was inventive.  His inventive faculties, however, took\r\nhim far too high at first, like a badly ballasted balloon.  He thought\r\nof ministering to governments of nations--of putting into their hands\r\ninstruments for the destruction of his fellow mortals that should render\r\nwar impossible, and many other equally airy speculations.\r\n\r\nHe failed, and had to come down a piece.  There is no use in soaring too\r\nhigh above the clouds if one would be a useful inventor and a benefactor\r\nto mankind.  Darning-needles are of more service to the general public\r\nthan dynamite guns, and they are more easily manufactured.  So Tandy\r\nfailed in all his big things.  That balloon of his was still soaring too\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\"I guess,\" he said to himself, \"I'll have to come a little lower still\r\nbefore I find out just what the world wants, and what _all_ the world\r\nwants.\"\r\n\r\nFood?  Physic?  Fire?\r\n\r\nHa! he had it.  Fire, of course.  How many a poor wretch starves to\r\ndeath in a garret just because coals are too dear to purchase.  \"And\r\nwhy?\" he asked himself; and the answer came fast enough, \"Because coals\r\nare wasted by the rich.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tandy set his brains on to simmer, and invented one of the simplest\r\ncontrivances in the world for saving waste.\r\n\r\nYes, he had it at last, and in two years' time he began to gain a\r\ncompetence, which was gradually increasing.\r\n\r\nThis little cottage down by the sad, sad sea, as sentimental old maids\r\ncall it, was his own.  He and Babs--or little Nelda, as we may now call\r\nher--had only been here for six months.  The place was by no means a\r\nfashionable one, although many people came here in summer to seek for\r\nhealth on the glorious sands and rocks, and among the fields and woods\r\nthat stretched northwards into the interior.\r\n\r\nAs for Ransey Tansey, Captain Weathereye had really done his best to\r\nsecure the welfare of this half-wild lad, just as Miss Scragley tried to\r\nassist his wee sister.\r\n\r\nImpressionable children learn very quickly, and in a year's time Ransey\r\nwas so much improved in manners that Miss Scragley rather encouraged his\r\nvisits to the Hall than otherwise, especially when the Admiral and Bob\r\ncame along with him.\r\n\r\nGrand old lawns and shrubberies surrounded the Hall, and these ended in\r\nwoods.  There were artificial lakes and islands in them too.  These\r\nislands were the especial property of many beautiful ducks; but one was\r\nso large, and surrounded by such a big stretch of water, that the only\r\nthing to make it perfect--so Ransey thought--was a boat or skiff.  Eedie\r\nwas of the same opinion; so was Babs and Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible to build one?\" thought Ransey.  He felt sure it was;\r\nso did Eedie.\r\n\r\nBefore two months had passed, that skiff, with the assistance of\r\nWeathereye, was a _fait accompli_; and the old captain was just as proud\r\nof it as the children themselves.\r\n\r\nThe ducks didn't have it all their own way now on the island.  For here\r\na wigwam was built, and almost every fine day--that is, when Ransey was\r\nnot at his lessons--the children played at Crusoes and wild Indians, and\r\nI don't know what all.\r\n\r\nThere was no end to Tansey's imagination, no end to his daring, no end\r\nto his tricks, and in these last, I fear, Eedie encouraged him.\r\n\r\nShe was but two years younger than Ransey, but she was four years older\r\nas far as worldly wisdom was concerned; and with her assistance the\r\ndramas, or theatrical performances, carried out on the island were at\r\ntimes startling in the extreme.\r\n\r\nWhen Eedie brought children friends of hers to see these plays, Ransey\r\nwould have felt very shy indeed had he not had, figuratively speaking,\r\nEedie's wing to shelter under.  Encouraged by her, he soon found out\r\nthat real talent can make its own way, and be appreciated, however\r\nhumble its possessor may be.\r\n\r\nWhen Tandy first met Captain Weathereye, he wanted to be profuse in his\r\nthanks to this kindly staff-commander.  But the latter would have none\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\"Tandy,\" he said, \"I know by your every action that you are a true\r\nsailor, like--ahem!--myself.  Perhaps what you call kindness to your boy\r\nis only a fad of mine, and therefore selfishness after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can say `Yo, yo,' to your `No, no.'  Besides, we are all of us\r\nsailing over the sea of life for goodness knows where, and we are in\r\nduty bound to help even little boats we may sight, if we see they're in\r\ndistress.\"\r\n\r\nTandy and Weathereye had soon became good friends, and smoked many a\r\npipe together; nor did Tandy hesitate to tell the navy sailor about all\r\nhis inventions and little speculations, to which account the latter\r\nlistened delightedly enough.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" he said to Tandy one day, \"your lad is now over ten, and we\r\nshould send him right away to sea.  I tell you straight, Tandy, I'd get\r\nhim into the Royal Navy if it were worth while.  But he'd never be a\r\nsailor, never learn seamanship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound their old tin-kettles,\" he added, bringing his fist down on\r\nthe table with a force that made the glasses jingle, \"there isn't a\r\nsailor on board one of them; only gunners and greasers.  [Greaser, a\r\ndisparaging name for an engineer in the Royal Navy.]  Let Ransey rough\r\nit, Mr Tandy, and you'll make a man of him.\"\r\n\r\nAn apprenticeship in a Dundee trader, owned in Belfast, and sailing from\r\nCardiff, this was secured; though what use a lad not yet eleven might be\r\nput to on board such a craft, I confess I hardly know.  But this I _do_\r\nknow, that the sooner a boy who is to be a British sailor goes to sea\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBabs ventured back to the window at last, and glanced once more out into\r\nthe now gathering gloom.  Far away beyond Selsea Bill the sun had set\r\nbehind lurid coppery clouds, that boded little good for ships that were\r\ntoiling up the Channel.\r\n\r\n\"O daddy, here is postie at long, long last, and he's all, all dressed\r\nin oilskins!  He is coming to the door!  Oh!\"\r\n\r\nShe could not say another word for a few moments, but flew toward her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"It is--it is--O daddy! _it's Ransey_!\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\n\"SHIP-SHAPE AND SEAMAN-FASHION.\"\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a doubt about that, and no lad surely ever got a happier\r\nwelcome home.\r\n\r\nBob and Murrams knew him, and the Admiral too, who danced for joy in the\r\nback-garden when Ransey Tansey went to see him.\r\n\r\nEverybody, with the exception of the father, seemed to walk on air that\r\nnight.  Mr Tandy was simply quietly happy.\r\n\r\nRansey was quite a man, Babs told him, and she felt sure he would soon\r\nhave a moustache.  Indeed, she brought a small magnifying-glass to\r\nstrengthen her convictions on this point.\r\n\r\nWhat a lot lads have to tell when they return from sea for the first\r\ntime! and their friends cannot give them greater pleasure than by\r\nlistening to all their adventures and \"hairbreadth scapes;\" sympathising\r\nwith them in sorrows past and gone, and dangers encountered, and\r\nthanking Providence that they have been spared to come safely home from\r\noff the stormy ocean.\r\n\r\nRansey had gone to the old cottage first, not knowing anything about the\r\nchange.  He had found strangers there, and his heart had sunk to zero.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"they are dead and gone.\"\r\n\r\nNo Bob to meet him! no Babs! no dancing crane!\r\n\r\nHe hadn't had the heart to go in; he just ran right away to Captain\r\nWeathereye's, and he told him all.\r\n\r\nRansey had had to sling his hammock here the first night, and visit Miss\r\nScragley's next day.\r\n\r\nAnd Eedie was now ten years of age, and shy, but welcomed Ransey with a\r\nsoft handshake and a bonnie blush, and in her little secret morsel of a\r\nheart admired him.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you I'd make a man of him, Miss Scragley?  See how tall\r\nhe is.  Look at those bold blue eyes of his, and the sea-tan on his\r\ncheeks,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that it was Ransey's turn to blush.\r\n\r\n\"Tell your father, dear boy, that in four or five days I'm coming down\r\nto B--to see him.  A breath of the briny will do an old barnacle like me\r\na power of good.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will,\" the boy had replied.\r\n\r\nThen, after saying good-bye, Ransey went off to see Mrs Farrow; and\r\nthat good lady was indeed pleased, for she had always had an idea that\r\nthose who went to sea hardly ever returned.\r\n\r\nShe had to put the corner of her apron to her eyes now; but, if she did\r\nshed a tear, it was one of joy and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWell, it would have done your heart good to have witnessed the happiness\r\nof Ransey and Babs, as they wandered hand in hand along the golden\r\nsands.  Bob, too, was so elated that he hardly knew what to do with\r\nhimself at first.  This joy, however, settled down into a watchful kind\r\nof care and love for his young master; and he used to walk steadily\r\nbehind him on the beach as if afraid that, if he once let him out of\r\nsight, he might be spirited away and never be seen again.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral was quite a seafarer now, and wonderful and sweet were the\r\nmorsels he found or dug up for himself on the wet stretches of sand.\r\nThe sea-gulls at first had taken him for something uncanny; but they now\r\ntook him for granted, and walked about quite close to him, although at\r\ntimes, when this marvellous bird took it into his long head that a dance\r\nwould do him good and increase his circulation, they were scared indeed,\r\nand flew screaming seawards.\r\n\r\nBut the Admiral didn't mind that a bit; he just kept dancing away till\r\nthere really didn't seem to be a bit more dance left in him.  Then he\r\ndesisted, and went in for serious eating once more.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOne beautiful day, while the dancing crane was holding a levee of\r\nsea-gulls, with a sprinkling of rooks, far seawards on the wet sands,\r\nwhile Mr Tandy was seated, smoking as usual, on a bench with his\r\nchildren near him, Bob uttered a defiant kind of a growl, and stood up\r\nwith his hair on end from ears to rump.  A gentleman dressed in blue,\r\nwith sailor's cap on his head, and reading a newspaper, was approaching\r\nthe seat, on which there was plenty of room for one more.\r\n\r\nBut it was not at him that Bob was growling.  No, but at a beautiful\r\nScottish collie which was walking by his side.\r\n\r\nBob rushed forward at once, and the two met face to face and heads up.\r\n\r\nScottie carried his tail defiantly high.\r\n\r\nYoung England would have done the same with his, had he had anything to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nThe conversation seemed to be somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"You and I are about the same size, aren't we?\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't much to figure on between us, I think,\" replied Scottie.\r\n\r\n\"Lower your flag, then, or I'll shake you out of your skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scotland never lowered flag to a foreigner yet.  Why don't you raise\r\nyour standard?  Why, because you haven't got one to raise.  Ha, ha! what\r\na fright you are!  I only wonder your master lets you go about like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah--ah--r-r--r-r--r-r!\"\r\n\r\n\"Waugh--r-r--r-r--r-r--r!\"\r\n\r\nAnd there _was_ war next second.\r\n\r\nTandy rushed to the scene of action.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" he said.  \"Which dog, do you think, began the\r\nfight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they both began it,\" said the newcomer, laughing.\r\n\r\nScotland and England were having a terrible tulzie, as Scotland and\r\nEngland have often had in days long, long gone by.\r\n\r\nThey were rolling over each other, sometimes Bob above, sometimes Bob\r\nbelow, and the yellow sands were soon stained with blood.\r\n\r\nLittle Nelda was in tears, and the Admiral scray-scraying and dancing\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the stranger, \"they've both had enough of it, and my\r\nproposal is this--I'll pull my dog off by the tail, and you do the same\r\nby yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd gladly do so,\" said Tandy, laughing, \"but, my dear sir, the fact is\r\nthat my dog is like Tam o' Shanter's mare after she escaped from the\r\nwitches--\r\n\r\n  \"`The ne'er a tail has he to shake.'\"\r\n\r\nDogs are just like men, however, and these two, seemingly satisfied that\r\nneither could kill the other, soon made it up, and presently they went\r\ngalloping off together to the sea to wash the sand out of their shaggy\r\njackets.\r\n\r\nDown sat the stranger between Ransey and his father.  He rolled up his\r\npaper and lit his pipe, and soon the two were engaged in a very animated\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nSailors all three.  No wonder that the acquaintance thus brought about\r\nby their honest dogs ripened into friendship in a few days.\r\n\r\nCaptain Halcott--for so this new friend was named--had, some months\r\nbefore this, reached England after a very long and strangely adventurous\r\ncruise.\r\n\r\n\"Are you like me, I wonder?\" he said to Tandy, as they sat smoking the\r\ncalumet of peace together on a breezy cliff-top, while Ransey and his\r\nsister were fishing for curios in the pools of water left among the\r\nrocks by the receding tide.  \"Are you like me, I wonder? for I am no\r\nsooner safely arrived in Merrie England than I begin once more to long\r\nfor life on the heaving billows.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a free man, Captain Halcott; I've got a little family; and\r\nyou're a somewhat younger man, as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; granted.  But, before going further, tell me what is your\r\nChristian name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and mine's Charlie.  We're both seafarers; don't let us `Mr'\r\neach other, or `captain' each other either.  You're Tandy or you're\r\nDick, I'm Halcott or I'm Charlie, just as, for the time being, the\r\nhumour may suit us.  Is that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right--ship-shape and seaman-fashion.\"  Two brown fists met and\r\nwere shaken--no mincing landlubber's shake, but a firm and hearty grip\r\nand wholesome pressure; a grip that seemed to speak and to say,--\"Thine,\r\nlad, thine!  Thine in peace or war; in calm or tempest, thine!\"\r\n\r\nHow is it that sailors so often resemble one another?  I cannot answer\r\nthe question.  But it is none the less true.\r\n\r\nTandy and Halcott appeared to have been cast in the same mould; the same\r\nopen, bronzed, and weather-beaten faces, the same eyes--eyes that could\r\ntwinkle with merriment one moment and be filled with pity the next.\r\n\r\nEven Captain Weathereye himself, although older than either, and\r\nsomewhat lighter in complexion, might easily have passed as brother to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Halcott, \"I daresay you have a story to tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had strange experiences in life, and some were sad enough.  For\r\nthe sake of that dear boy and girl, I thank God I am no longer in the\r\ngrip of poverty; but, my friend, I've seen worse days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, Tandy.\"\r\n\r\nTandy told him, sitting there, all the reader already knows and much\r\nmore, receiving silent but heartfelt sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"So you've sold the _Merry Maiden_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; although some of the happiest years of my life were spent on board\r\nof her, and in the little cottage.  Heigho!  I wish I could bring back\r\nthe past; but if I live to be able to afford it, I shall build a house\r\nwhere the old cot stands, and will just end my days there, you know.\r\nAnd now for your story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is a strange and a sad one; but as your friend is coming down\r\nto-morrow, I propose postponing it.  This Captain Weathereye must, from\r\nall you say, be a real jolly fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to; and next morning Tandy met bluff old Weathereye at\r\nthe little railway station.\r\n\r\n\"I'll stay a week, Tandy, a whole week.  Yes, my hearty, I'll gladly\r\nmake your house my home, and shall rejoice to see your friend, and hear\r\nthe yarn he has got to spin.\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nA QUARTERDECK DREAM.\r\n\r\n\"Once a sailor, gentlemen,\" began Halcott, as he filled his pipe, gazing\r\nthoughtfully over the sea, \"always a sailor.\r\n\r\n\"That's a truism, I believe.  Why, the very sight of the waves out\r\nyonder, with the evening sunlight dancing and playing on their surface,\r\nmakes me even at this moment long to tread the deck again.\r\n\r\n\"And there are, perhaps, few seafarers who have more inducements to stay\r\nat home than I, Charlie Halcott, have.\r\n\r\n\"I have a beautiful house of my own, and some day soon, I hope, you will\r\nboth come and see it, and judge for yourselves.\r\n\r\n\"My house has a tower to it.  Many a night, while walking the\r\nquarterdeck keeping my watch, with no companions save the silver-shining\r\nstars, I have said to myself--`Charlie Halcott,' I have said, `if ever\r\nyou leave off ploughing the ocean wave, and settle down on shore, you\r\nmust have a house with a tower to it.'\r\n\r\n\"And now I've got it.\r\n\r\n\"A large, square, old-fashioned tower it is, with a mullioned window on\r\neach side of it; and up the walls the dense green ivy climbs, with just\r\nenough Virginia creeper to cast a glamour of crimson over it in autumn,\r\nlike the last red rays of the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\"One window looks up the valley of the Thames, where not far off is a\r\nlittle Niagara, a snow-white weir: I can hear the drowsy monotone of its\r\nfoaming waters by night and by day, and its song is ever the same.\r\nAnother window looks away down the valley, and the river here goes\r\nwinding in and out among the meadows and the green and daisied leas,\r\ntill, finally, it takes the appearance of a silver string, and loses\r\nitself, or is lost to me, amidst the distant trees.  A third window,\r\nfrom which I dearly like to look early on a summer's morning, while the\r\nblackbirds are yet in fullest, softest song, shows an English landscape\r\nthat to me is the sweetest of the sweet.  As far as eye can reach, till\r\nbounded by the grey horizon's haze, are woods and wilds and meadows\r\ngreen, with the red gables or the roofs of many a stately farm peeping\r\nup through the rolling cloudland of foliage; and many a streamlet too,\r\nseen here and there in the sunbeams, as it goes speeding on towards the\r\nsilent river.\r\n\r\n\"But though this house of mine has a tower to it, it is not a castle by\r\nany means, apart from the fact that every Englishman's house is his\r\ncastle.  I have a tower, but no donjon keep.  My castle is a villa--`a\r\nhandsome modern-built villa,' the agent described it when I commenced\r\ncorrespondence with a view to its purchase.  It is indeed a beautiful\r\nvilla, and it is situated high up on the brow of a hill, all among the\r\ndreamy woods.\r\n\r\n\"Though I have been but a short spell on shore, my town friends already\r\ncall me the `Sailor hermit,' because I stick to my castle and its woods\r\nand gardens.  Not for a single day can they prevail upon me to exchange\r\nit for the bustle and din of hideous London.  But I retaliated on my\r\ncity friends by bringing them down to my `castle' in spring time, when\r\nthe early flowers were opening their petals in the warm sunshine, and\r\nthe very tulips seemed panting in the heat, and when there was such a\r\ngush of bird-melody coming from grove and copse and hedgerow that every\r\nleaf seemed to hide a feathered songster.  And I rejoiced to see those\r\nfriends of mine struck dumb by the wealth of beauty they beheld around\r\nthem.  For Philomel was making day melodious with a strange, unearthly\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\"All through the darkness the bird sang to his mate, and all through the\r\nday as well.  No bolder birds than our nightingales live.  They sing at\r\nour side, at our feet; they sing as they fly, sing as they alight, sing\r\n_to_ us, ay and _at_ us defiantly.  No wonder we all love this sweet\r\nbird, this sweet spirit of the spring.\r\n\r\n\"So my quarterdeck dream has become a dear reality.\r\n\r\n\"Strange to say, it is always at night that I think most of the ocean.\r\nAnd on nights of storm--then it is that I lie awake listening to the\r\nwind roaring through the stately elms, with a sound like the sough of\r\ngale-tossed waves.  It is then I long to tread once more the deck of my\r\nown bonnie barque, and feel her move beneath me like a veritable thing\r\nof life and reason.  My house with the ivied tower is well away among\r\nthe midlands; and yet on nights of tempest, sea-birds--the gull, and the\r\ntern, and the light-winged kittywake--often fly around the house and the\r\ntrees.  I can hear their voices rising shrill and high above the roar of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n\"`Kaye--kay--ay--ay,' they scream.  `Come away--come away--ay,' they\r\nseem to cry.  `Why have you left us? why have you left the seas?  We\r\nmiss you.  Come away--come away--ay--ay.'\r\n\r\n\"Never into my quarterdeck dreams, gentlemen, had there come, strange to\r\nsay, a companion fair of womankind.  My house with the tower to it\r\nshould be just as it is to-day, just what--following out my dreams--I\r\nhave made it.  Its gardens all should bloom surpassing fair, my woods\r\nand trees be green; the rose lawns should look like velvet; my ribboned\r\nflower-beds like curves of coloured light; the nightingales in spring\r\nshould bathe in the spray of my fountains,--there should be joy and\r\nloveliness and bird-song everywhere, but a wife?--well, I had somehow\r\nnever dreamt of that.  If any of the officers--for I was captain and\r\npart owner of the good barque _Sea Flower_--had been bold enough to\r\nsuggest such a thing--I mean such a _person_, I should have laughed at\r\nhim where he stood.  `Who,' I should have said, `would many a simple\r\nsailor like me, over thirty, brown-red in face, and hard in hands.  Who\r\nindeed?'\r\n\r\n\"But into my quarterdeck dreams companions had come.  Should I not have\r\njolly farmers and solid-looking red-faced squires to dine with me, and\r\nto smoke with me out of doors in the cool of midsummer evenings, or in\r\nthe cosy red parlour around the fire in the long forenights of winter,\r\nand listen to my yarns of the dark blue sea, or talk to me of the\r\ndelights of rural life?  Well, it was a pretty dream, it must be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\"But it never struck me then, as it does now, that all the joys of life\r\nare tame indeed, unless shared by some one you love more than all things\r\nbright and fair.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty dream--and a beautiful dream.  A piece of ice itself is\r\nbeautiful at times; but perhaps, as we stand and admire it, the sunshine\r\nmay steal down and melt it.  Then we find that we love the sunshine even\r\nmore than we loved the ice.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"It is not every sailor who has the luck to be captain, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, master, of so fine a sailing craft as the _Sea Flower_,\r\nat the age of twenty-six.  But such had been my fortune; and I had\r\nsailed the seas in her for six long years, and, with the exception of\r\nthe few accidents inseparable from a life at sea, I had never had a\r\nserious mishap.  Many a wild gale had we weathered in her, my mate and\r\nI; many a dark and tempestuous night had we staggered along under bare\r\npoles; more than once had we sprung a leak, and twice had we been on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"But all ended well, and during our brief spells on shore, either in\r\nEngland or in some foreign port, though James and I always managed to\r\nenjoy ourselves in our own quiet way, yet neither he nor I was sorry\r\nwhen we got back home again to our bonnie barque, and were once more\r\nafloat on the heaving sea.\r\n\r\n\"James was perhaps more of a sailor than I.  Well, he was some years my\r\nsenior, and he was browner and harder by far, and every inch a man.  And\r\nthough a very shy one, as far as female society is concerned, he was a\r\nvery bold one nevertheless.  But for his courageous example on the night\r\nof our last fire, the _Sea Flower_ would have helped to swell the list\r\nof those ships that go to sea and are heard of no more.\r\n\r\n\"When we were taken aback in a white squall in the Indian Ocean, and it\r\nverily seemed that we had but a few minutes to float, James was here,\r\nthere, and everywhere, his manly voice, calm and collected, ringing high\r\nabove the roaring of the wind and the surging of the terrible seas.  The\r\nvery fire of his bravery on that occasion affected the men, and they\r\nworked as only bold men can work in face of death and danger, till our\r\ncraft was once more righted and tearing along before the wind.\r\n\r\n\"And just as brave on shore as afloat was sturdy James Malone.\r\n\r\n\"When our steward was attacked by fifty spear-armed savages on shore at\r\nthe Looboo Island, my mate seized a club that a gorilla could hardly\r\nhave wielded, and fought his way through the black and vengeful crowd,\r\ntill he reached and saved our faithful steward.\r\n\r\n\"And, that day, it was not until he had almost reached the ship that he\r\ntold me, with that half-shy and quiet smile of his, that he believed he\r\nwas slightly wounded.  Then he fainted dead away.\r\n\r\n\"I nursed poor James back to health.  Yes, but more than once, both\r\nbefore and after that event, he nursed me, and I doubt if even a brother\r\ncould have been half so kind as my mate James.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"For many a long year, then, James and I had sailed the salt seas\r\ntogether.  Without James sitting opposite me at the table at breakfast\r\nor at dinner, the neatly painted and varnished saloon, with all its\r\nglittering odds and ends, wouldn't have seemed the same.  Without James\r\nsitting near me on the quarterdeck on black-dark evenings in the\r\ntropics, I should have felt very strange and lonesome indeed.\r\n\r\n\"But James and I didn't agree on every subject on which we conversed.\r\nHad we done so, conversation would have lost its special charm.  No, he\r\naired his opinions and I shook out mine.  There were times when I\r\nconvinced James; there were times when James convinced me; there were\r\ntimes when neither convinced the other, and then we agreed to differ.\r\n\r\n\"`Very well, sir,' James would say, `you has your 'pinions, and I has\r\nmine.  You keeps to your 'pinions, and I sticks to mine.'\r\n\r\n\"It will be noted that James's ordinary English would scarcely have\r\npassed muster in the first families of Europe.  But, like many of his\r\nclass, James could talk correctly enough when he set himself the task.\r\nBut there was no better sailor afloat for all that, and on the stormiest\r\nnight or squalliest day I always felt safe when my first mate trod the\r\nplanks.\r\n\r\n\"James could tell a good story too, and I used to keep him at it of an\r\nevening--any evening save Sunday.  On Sunday, James did nothing in the\r\nintervals of duty except read the Bible--the `Good Book,' as he called\r\nit.  This New Testament was one of those large type editions which very\r\nold people use.\r\n\r\n\"His mother--dead and gone--had left him that Book, and also her\r\ngold-rimmed specs, and it was interesting, on a Sunday afternoon, to see\r\nJames sitting solemnly down to the Book, and shipping those specs\r\nathwart his nose.\r\n\r\n\"`What on earth,' I said once to him, `do you use the specs for, my\r\nfriend?'\r\n\r\n\"When James looked up at me, half-upbraidingly, those eyes of his, seen\r\nthrough the powerful lenses, looked as big and wild and round as a\r\ncatamount's.  It was unearthly.\r\n\r\n\"`My mother bade me.  Would you disobey your mother?'\r\n\r\n\"This was a bombshell, and I said no more.\r\n\r\n\"But there was one subject on which James and I never disagreed--namely,\r\n`the ladies,' as he called women folks.  `They are deceitful above all\r\nthings, and desperately wicked,' James would say, `and I means to steer\r\nclear on 'em.'  And James always did.\r\n\r\n\"There was one pleasure James and I had in common--namely, witnessing a\r\ngood tragedy on the boards of Liverpool theatre.  You see this was our\r\nport of destination on our return from the far, far south.  Mind, we\r\nwouldn't go to see a drama, because there might be too much nonsensical\r\nlove business in it, and too many of `the frivolous antics of women'--\r\nJames's own words.  But in a tragedy the women often came to grief,\r\nwhich James thought was only natural.\r\n\r\n\"So we chose tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, one night at this same theatre, I had one of the strangest\r\nexperiences of my life; and never yet have I found any one who could\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\n\"James and I had gone early that evening, because there was something\r\nspecially tragic on, and we desired to secure good seats.  We sat in the\r\nfront row, and at the left end of the row, because we wished to leave\r\nthe theatre between each act to enjoy a few whiffs of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"The play was well begun, and my eyes were riveted on the stage.  There\r\nwas a momentary silence, and during this time I was sensible, from a\r\nslight rustling noise, that the private box behind and above me was\r\nbeing occupied.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear psychologists mention the term or feeling `ecstasy'?\r\nThat was what stole over me now.  For a few minutes I saw nothing on the\r\nstage; only a feeling of intense happiness, such as I have seldom\r\nexperienced since that night, stole over me, occupying, bathing, I may\r\nsay, my whole soul and mind.\r\n\r\n\"I turned at last, and my eyes met those of a young lady in that private\r\nbox.  Never before had I seen such radiant beauty.  Never had I been\r\nimpressed with beauty of any kind before.  My heart almost stood still.\r\nIt was really an awful moment--that is, if intense happiness can ever be\r\nawful.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it is possible for a sailor, with a face as brown as the back\r\nof a fiddle, to blush, I blushed.  She, too, I think, coloured just a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?  What could it mean?\r\n\r\n\"I know not how I sat out the act.  When I rose with James to go out, I\r\ndared one other glance towards the box.  The lady had gone, and a\r\nfeeling of coldness crept round my heart.  I felt as depressed now as I\r\nhad recently felt happy.\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I said, `take me home, I--I believe I'm ill.'\r\n\r\n\"`Why,' said James, `you look as though you had seen a ghost.'\r\n\r\n\"I got home.  Something, I knew not what, was going to happen; but all\r\nthat night dream after dream haunted my pillow, and of every dream, the\r\nsweet young face I had seen in the private box was the only thing I\r\ncould remember when daylight broke athwart the eastern sky.\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR, UNSELFISH, BUT SOMEWHAT SILLY FELLOW.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never had a secret from James Malone; no, not so much as one.  Had I\r\nknown what was the matter with me on the evening before, I should have\r\ntold James manfully and in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"But when he came to my rooms in the morning, to share my humble\r\nbreakfast, and consult about the duties of the day, we being just then\r\nfitting out for sea,--\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I began--\r\n\r\n\"And then--well, then I told him all the story, even down to my strange\r\ndreams and the sweet young face that had haunted them.\r\n\r\n\"`Why, James,' I concluded, `I have only to close my eyes now to see her\r\nonce again, and I can neither read nor write without thinking of her.'\r\n\r\n\"James sat silently beholding me for fully a minute.  His face was\r\nclouded, and pity and anxiety were in every lineament of his manly\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\"`I'm taken aback,' he stammered at last.  `White squalls is nothin' to\r\nit.  Charlie Halcott, you're _in love_.  It's an awful, fearful thing.\r\nNo surgical operation can do anything for you.  It's worse by far than I\r\nthought.  A mild touch of the cholera would be mere moonshine to this.\r\nA brush wi' Yellow Jack wouldn't be a circumstance to it.  O Halcott,\r\nHalcott!  O Charlie! what _am_ I to do with you?'\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I interrupted, `light your pipe.  Did _you_ see the beautiful\r\nvision--the lovely child?'\r\n\r\n\"`I followed your eyes.'\r\n\r\n\"`And what saw you, James?'  I asked, leaning eagerly towards him.\r\n\r\n\"`I saw what appeared to be--a woman.  Nothin' more and nothin' less.'\r\n\r\n\"`James, did you not notice her blue and heavenly eyes, that seemed to\r\nswim in ether; her delicately pencilled eyebrows; the long lashes that\r\nswept the rounded rosy cheeks; her golden hair like sunset's glow; her\r\nlittle mouth; her lips like the blossom of the blueberry, and the\r\ndelicate play of her mobile countenance?'\r\n\r\n\"`Delicate play of a mobile marling-spike!' cried James, jumping up.  He\r\nrammed a piece of paper into his pipe and thrust it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"`Charles Halcott, I'm off,' he cried.\r\n\r\n\"`Off, James?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, off.  Every man Jack shall be on board the _Sea Flower_ to-day,\r\nbag and baggage.  We'll drop down stream to-morrow morning early, ship a\r\npilot, and get away to sea without more ado.'\r\n\r\n\"He was at the door by the time he had finished but he stopped a moment\r\nwith a look of wondrous pity on his handsome face, then came straight\r\nback and clasped my hand in brotherly affection, and so, without another\r\nword, walked out and away.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I was master of the _Sea Flower_, but in the matter of sailing\r\nnext day--three or four whole days before I had intended--I should no\r\nmore have thought of gainsaying honest James Malone than of disobeying\r\nmy father had he been alive.  James was acting towards me with true\r\nbrotherly affection, quite disinterestedly in my behalf, and--_quien\r\nsabe_?--probably saving me from a lifetime's misery.\r\n\r\n\"I would be advised by James.\r\n\r\n\"So after he had left, and I had smoked in solitary sadness for about an\r\nhour, I rose with a sigh, and commenced throwing my things together in\r\nthe great mahogany sea-chest that while afloat stood in my state-room,\r\nand which on shore I never travelled without.\r\n\r\n\"For the whole of that forenoon I wandered about the streets of\r\nLiverpool, looking chiefly at the photographers' windows.  I was\r\nbewitched, and possessed some faint hope of seeing a photograph of her\r\nwho had bewitched me.  I even entered the shops under pretence of\r\nbargaining for a likeness of my sailor-self, and looked over their books\r\nof specimens.\r\n\r\n\"Had I come across her picture, the temptation to purchase it would, I\r\nfear, have proved irresistible.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly I pulled myself taut up with a round turn, and planked myself,\r\nso to speak, on my mental quarterdeck before Commander Conscience.\r\n\r\n\"`What are you doing, or trying to do, Charles Halcott?' said Commander\r\nConscience.\r\n\r\n\"`Only trying,' replied Charles Halcott, `to procure a photograph of the\r\nloveliest young lady on earth, whose eyes shine like stars in beauty's\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\n\"`Don't be a fool, Charles Halcott.  Are you not wise enough to know\r\nthat, even if you procure this photograph, you will have to keep it a\r\nsecret from honest James Malone?  His friendship is better far than love\r\nof womankind.  Besides,' added Commander Conscience, `you need no\r\nphotograph.  Is not the image of the lady who has bewitched you\r\nindelibly photographed upon your soul?  Charles Halcott, I am ashamed of\r\nyou!'\r\n\r\n\"I stood at a window for a few minutes, looking sheepish enough; then I\r\nthrew temptation to the winds, put about, and sailed right away back to\r\nmy chambers, studding-sails set low and aloft.\r\n\r\n\"I finished packing, saw my owners in the afternoon, and when James came\r\noff to the ship he found me quietly smoking my biggest pipe in the\r\nsaloon of the _Sea Flower_.\r\n\r\n\"He smiled now.\r\n\r\n\"`Better already,' he said; `His name be praised!'\r\n\r\n\"James was a strange man in some ways.  This was one: he thanked Heaven\r\nfor every comfort, even the slightest, and did nothing without, in a\r\nword or two, asking a blessing thereon.\r\n\r\n\"In three days' time we were staggering southwards, and away across\r\nBiscay's blue bay, with every inch of canvas set.  And a pretty sight we\r\nwere--our white sails flowing in the sunshine--the sea as blue as the\r\nsky, and the waves sparkling around us as if every drop of water\r\ncontained a diamond.\r\n\r\n\"All the way to the Cape, and farther, James treated me as tenderly and\r\ncompassionately as if I had been an invalid brother.  He never\r\ncontradicted me even once.  He used to keep me talking and yarning on\r\nthe quarterdeck, when he wasn't on watch, for whole hours at a stretch;\r\nand in the evenings, when tired spinning me yarns, he would take his\r\nbanjo and sing to me old sea-songs in his bold and thrilling voice.  And\r\nJames could sing too; there were the brine, and the breeze, and the\r\nbillows' roll in every bar of the grand old songs he sang, and indeed I\r\nwas never tired of listening to them.  Sometimes I closed my eyes as I\r\nsat in my easy-chair; then James's banjo notes grew softer and softer,\r\nand ever so much farther away like, till at last it was ghostly music,\r\nand I was in the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n\"When I awoke, perhaps it would be four bells or even six, and there\r\nwould be James, with his specs athwart his great jibboom of a nose,\r\nporing earnestly over his mother's Bible.\r\n\r\n\"`You've had a nice little nap,' he would say cheerfully.  `Now you'll\r\ntoddle off to your bunk, and when you're safe between the sheets I'll\r\nbring you a tiny little drop of rum and treacle.'\r\n\r\n\"Poor James!  Rum and treacle was his panacea for every ill; and yet I\r\ndon't believe any one in the wide world ever saw James the worse of even\r\nrum and treacle.\r\n\r\n\"When we got as far as to Madeira, he proposed we should anchor here for\r\na few days and dispose of some of our notions.  Notions formed our\r\ncargo; and notions must be understood to mean, Captain Weathereye, all\r\nkinds of jewellery and knick-knacks, including table-knives and forks,\r\nwatches, strings of bright beads, cotton cloths, parasols, and guns.\r\nNow I knew very well that we could easily dispose of all our cargo at\r\nthe Cape and other parts; but I also knew very well that James's main\r\nobject in stopping at Madeira was to give me a few delightful days on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"This was part of the cure, and I had to submit with the best grace I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"We had, at that time, as handy and good a second mate as any one could\r\nwish on the weather side of a quarterdeck.  So it was easy enough for\r\nmyself and James to leave the ship both at the same time, though this\r\nhad very seldom been our custom, except when in dock or in harbour.\r\n\r\n\"To put it in plain language, James did not seem to know how good to be\r\nto me, nor how much to amuse me.  The honest, simple soul kept talking\r\nand yarning to me all the while, and pointing out this, that, and the\r\nother strange thing to me, until I was obliged to laugh in his face.\r\nBut James was not offended; not he.  He was working according to some\r\nplan he had formulated in his own mind, and nothing was going to turn\r\nhim aside from his purpose.\r\n\r\n\"About midday we entered the veranda of a cool and delightful hotel, and\r\nseating ourselves at a little marble table, James called for cigars and\r\niced drinks.  Then he proposed we should luncheon.  No, he would pay, he\r\nsaid; it was not often he had the honour or pleasure of lunching with\r\nhis captain, in a marble palace like this.  So he pulled out an old sock\r\ntied round with a morsel of blue ribbon, and thrusting his big brown paw\r\ninto it, brought forth money in abundance.\r\n\r\n\"`Never been here before?' he asked me quietly.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' I said; `strange to say I've touched at nearly every port in the\r\nworld except this place.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, I have,' said James, `and I'm going to put you up to the ropes.'\r\n\r\n\"`Now,' he continued, when we stood once more under the greenery of the\r\ntrees that bordered the broad pavement, `will you have a hammock or a\r\nhorse?'\r\n\r\n\"Not knowing quite what he meant, I replied that I would leave it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"`Well,' he said, `this must be considered a kind of picnic, them's my\r\nnotions, and as you're far from well yet, I'll have a horse and you a\r\nhammock.'\r\n\r\n\"Both horse and hammock were soon brought round to the door.  The\r\nhammock was borne by two perspiring half-caste Portuguese, and was\r\nattached to a pole, and on board I swung, while James got on board the\r\nhorse.  The saddle was a hard and horrid contrivance of leather and\r\nwood, the stirrups a pair of old slippers, and the horse himself--well,\r\nhe was a beautiful study in equine osteology, and I really did not know\r\nwhich to pity most, James or his Rosinante.  But in my hammock I felt\r\ncomfortably, dreamily happy.\r\n\r\n\"We passed through the quaint old town of Funchal, then upwards, and\r\naway towards the mountains.  The day was warm and delightful--hot indeed\r\nJames must have found it, for he soon divested himself of coat and\r\nwaistcoat, and even then he had to pause at times to wipe his streaming\r\nbrow.  The peeps at the beautiful gardens I caught while being carried\r\nalong were charming in the extreme; the verandaed and trellised villas,\r\ncanopied with flowers of every hue and shape, the bright green lawns\r\nwhere fairy-like children played, and the flowering trees--the whole\r\nforming ever-changing scenes of enchantment--I shall never forget.  Then\r\nthe soft and balmy air was laden with perfume.\r\n\r\n\"`How nice,' I thought, `to be an invalid!  How kind of James to treat\r\nme as one!  And he jogging along there on that bony horse's back, with\r\nthe boy holding fast by the tail!  Dear, unselfish, but somewhat silly\r\nfellow!'\r\n\r\n\"Upwards still, steeper and steeper the hill.  And now we seemed to have\r\nmounted into the very sky itself, and were far away from the tropics and\r\ntropical flora.\r\n\r\n\"We came at last to a table-land.  For the life of me I could not help\r\nthinking of the story of `Jack and the Bean-stalk.'  Here gorgeous\r\nheaths and heather bloomed and grew; here birds of sweet song flitted\r\nhither and thither among the scented and the yellow-tasselled broom; and\r\nhere solemn weird-like pine-trees waved dark against the far-off ocean's\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n\"Under some of these trees, and close to the cliff, we disembarked to\r\nrest.  We were fully half a mile above the level of the sea.  Yet not a\r\nstone's throw from where we sat was the edge of the awful cliff that led\r\ndownwards without a break to that white line far beneath where the waves\r\nfrothed and fumed against the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"But far as the eye could reach, till lost in distance and merged into\r\nthe blue of the sky, lay the azure sea, with here and there a sail, the\r\nlargest of which looked no bigger than a white butterfly with folded\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n\"A delicious sense of happiness stole over me, and for the first time,\r\nperhaps, since leaving England I forgot the sweet young face that had so\r\ncompletely bewitched me.\r\n\r\n\"I think I must have fallen asleep, for the next thing I was sensible of\r\nwas James tuning a broad guitar.\r\n\r\n\"Then his voice was raised in song, and I closed my eyes again, the\r\nbetter to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Poor James, he played and sang for over an hour; no wild, wailing\r\nsea-songs this time, however, but verses sweet and plaintive, and far\r\nmore in harmony with the notes of the sad guitar.  The romance of our\r\nsituation, the stillness of our surroundings, unbroken save in the\r\nintervals of song by the flitting of a wild bird among the broom, and\r\nthe low whisper of the wind through the pine-trees overhead, with the\r\nbalmy ozonic air from the blue ocean, continued to instil into my soul a\r\nfeeling of calm and perfect joy to which I had hitherto been a stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the sun was sinking like a great blood orange through a purple\r\nhaze that lay along the western horizon, James laughingly handed the\r\nguitar to the boy who had carried it.  Then laughing still--he was so\r\nstrange and good this James of mine--he pulled out a silver-mounted\r\nflask and poured me out a portion of its contents.\r\n\r\n\"It was a little rum and treacle.\r\n\r\n\"`The dews of night isn't going to harm you after that,' said James.\r\n\r\n\"Lights were glimmering here and there on the hills like glow-worms, and\r\nfar beneath us in the town, long before we reached the streets of\r\nFunchal.\r\n\r\n\"We went straight to the hotel and discharged both horse and hammock.\r\n\r\n\"Then we dined.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I should be allowed to go on board after this.  Not that\r\nthere was the slightest hurry.\r\n\r\n\"However, I was mistaken for once.  James had not yet done with me for\r\nthe night.  I had still another prescription of his to use; and as I\r\nknew it was part and parcel of James's love cure, I could not demur.  He\r\nhad given me so much pleasure on that day already, that when he asked me\r\nto get up and follow him I did so as obediently as the little lamb\r\nfollowed Mary.\r\n\r\n\"But that he, James Malone, who feared womankind, if he did not\r\npositively hate them, should lead me to a Portuguese ballroom of all\r\nplaces in the world, surprised me more than anything.\r\n\r\n\"I could hear the tinkling of guitars, the shuffling of feet, and the\r\nmusic of merry, laughing voices, long before we came near the door.\r\n\r\n\"I stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I said, `haven't you made some mistake?'\r\n\r\n\"His only answer was a roguish laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I repeated the question.\r\n\r\n\"`Not a bit of it,' he answered gaily.\r\n\r\n\"`Charlie Halcott,' he added, `if you were simply suffering from Yellow\r\nJack I'd hand you over to a doctor, but, Charles Halcott, it takes a\r\n_man_ to cure love.  And you've been sorely hit.'\r\n\r\n\"This had been a day of surprises, but when I entered that ballroom\r\nthere came the greatest surprise of all.  Those here assembled were not\r\nso-called gentle-folks.  They were the sons and daughters of the\r\nordinary working classes; but the taste displayed, the banks of flowers\r\naround the orchestra, the gay bouquets and coloured lights along the\r\nwalls, the polished and not overcrowded floor, the romantic dresses of\r\nthe gallants that transported one back to the middle ages, the\r\nsnow-white costumes of the ladies, and, above all, their innocent,\r\nravishing beauty, formed a scene that reminded me strongly of stories I\r\nhad read in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\r\n\r\n\"I was almost ashamed of my humble attire, but the courtesy of the\r\nmaster of ceremonies was charming.  Would the strangers dance?  Surely\r\nthe stranger sailors would dance?  He would get us, as partners, the\r\nloveliest senoritas in all the room.\r\n\r\n\"So he did.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot everything in that soft, dreamy waltz--everything save the\r\nthrilling music and the sylph-like form of my dark-eyed partner, who\r\nfloated with me through the perfumed air, for surely our feet never\r\ntouched the floor.\r\n\r\n\"But the drollest thing of all was this--James was dancing too.  James\r\nwith his--well, I must not say aversion to, but fear and shyness of\r\nwomankind, was dancing; and I knew he was only doing so to encourage me.\r\nA handsome fellow he looked, too, almost head and shoulders taller than\r\nany man there, and broad and well-knit in proportion.  The master of\r\nceremonies had got him a partner `for to match,' as he expressed it;\r\ncertainly a beautiful girl, with a wealth of raven hair that I had never\r\nseen equalled, far less surpassed.  I daresay she could dance lightly;\r\nbut James's waltzing was of a very solid brand indeed, and he swung his\r\npretty partner round the room in a way that seemed to indicate business\r\nrather than pleasure.  Several couples cannoned off James and went\r\nricochetting to the farther end of the room, and one went down.  James\r\nswung past me a moment after, apparently under a heavy press of canvas,\r\nand as he did so I heard him say to his partner, referring to the couple\r\nhe had brought to deck,--\r\n\r\n\"`They should keep out o' the way, then, when people are dancing.'\r\n\r\n\"The hours sped quickly by, as they always do in a ballroom, and by the\r\ntime James and I got on board the _Sea Flower_ four bells in the\r\nmiddle-watch were ringing out through the still, dark night.  But all\r\nwas safe and quiet on board.\r\n\r\n\"I took a turn on deck to enjoy a cigar before going below, just by way\r\nof cooling my brow.  When I went down at last, why, there was James\r\nseated at the table, his mother's Bible before him, and, as usual, the\r\nawful specs across his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Poor James, he was a strange man, but a sincere friend, as the sequel\r\nwill show.\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\n\"TILL THE SEA GIVES UP ITS DEAD.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Madeira, where we stayed for many days, going on shore every\r\nforenoon to sell some of our cargo to the shopkeepers, and every\r\nafternoon for a long ride--horse and hammock--over some part or other of\r\nthis island of enchantment, sometimes finishing up with a dance--from\r\nall this pleasure and delight, I say, we sailed away at last.\r\n\r\n\"South and away we sailed, and in due time we reached and anchored off\r\nSaint James's Town, Saint Helena.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Saint Helena had not figured in our programme when we left Merry\r\nEngland.  But here we were, and a most delightful place I found it.\r\nHills and dells, mountains and glens; wild flowers everywhere; and the\r\nblue eternal sea dotted with many a snow-white sail, engirdling all.\r\nThis, then, was the `lonely sterile rock in the midst of the wild\r\ntempestuous ocean,' to which Napoleon had been banished.\r\n\r\n\"James had been here before, although I had not, so everything was of\r\ninterest to me, and everything new.  And my good mate determined to make\r\nit as pleasant for me as possible.  He seemed to know every one, and\r\nevery one appeared delighted to see him.  Such remarks as the following\r\nfell upon our ears at every corner:--\r\n\r\n\"`Well, you've got back again, James?'\r\n\r\n\"`What! here you are once more, James, and welcome.'\r\n\r\n\"`Dee--lighted to see you, certain--lee!'\r\n\r\n\"`Ah!  Jeames,'--this from a very aged crone, who was seated on a stone\r\ndais near her door, basking in the warm, white sunshine--`ah!  Jeames,\r\nand sure the Lord is good to me.  And my old eyes are blessed once more\r\nwi' a sight o' your kindly face!'\r\n\r\n\"`Glad to see you alive, Frilda.  And look, I have got a pound of tea\r\nfor you.  And I'll come to-night and read a bit out of my mother's Good\r\nBook to you.'\r\n\r\n\"`Bless you, Jeames--bless you, my boy.'\r\n\r\n\"We went rambling all over the island that day.  We visited the fort,\r\nwhere James had many friends; then we went up a beautiful glen, and on\r\nreaching the top we struck straight off at right angles, and a walk of\r\nabout half a mile took us to one of the most pleasantly situated farms I\r\nhave ever seen.  It was owned by the farmer, a Scotsman of the name of\r\nMacDonald.  Nothing flimsy about this fine house.  The walls were built\r\nof sturdy stone, and must have been some feet thick, so that indoors in\r\nthe cheerful parlour it was cool and delightful, especially so with the\r\nodour of orange blossom blowing through the open window and pervading\r\nthe whole room.\r\n\r\n\"`Man, James, I'm so pleased.  Here!  Hi!  Mrs Mac, where are you?\r\nHere's James Malone, the honest, simple sumph come back again.  Jamie,\r\nman, ye must stop all night and give us a song.'\r\n\r\n\"`We--ll--I--'\r\n\r\n\"`No _wells_ nor _I's_ about it.  And your friend here too.'\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Mac was a very little body, with rosy cheeks, a merry voice, and\r\nblue eyes that looked you through and through.\r\n\r\n\"A little girl and boy came running in, and James soon had one on each\r\nknee; and while I and MacDonald talked in the window recess, he was deep\r\nin the mysteries of a mermaid story, his tiny audience listening with\r\nwondering eyes and rosy lips apart.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Mac had gone bustling away to send in a dram of hollands,\r\ncunningly flavoured with seeds and fruit rind.  She disappeared\r\nimmediately again, to send orders down to James's Town for fish and\r\nfowl.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we would stay all night?\r\n\r\n\"`Well,' I said, `the ship is safe, unless a tornado blows.'\r\n\r\n\"`There will be no tornado, sir,' said Farmer Mac.\r\n\r\n\"`I'll send off, then, and tell the second mate.'\r\n\r\n\"`My henchman is at your service, Captain Halcott.'\r\n\r\n\"`And look, see,' cried James, `just tell your henchman to bring my Good\r\nBook and specs.  I haven't the heart to disappoint old Mother Banks.'\r\n\r\n\"`And the guitar,' I added.\r\n\r\n\"`Well--well, yes.'\r\n\r\n\"The children clapped their hands with glee, and Maggie, the girl,\r\npulled James's face towards her by the whiskers and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\"We started next for Longwood and Napoleon's tomb.  Maggie and Jack--ten\r\nand nine years old respectively--came with us, and a right pleasant day\r\nwe spent.  There were bright-winged birds flitting hither and thither in\r\nthe dazzling sunshine, and singing sweet and low in trees of darkest\r\ngreen; but the happy voices of the children made sweeter music far to my\r\nears, and I'm sure to James's too.\r\n\r\n\"All along the roadsides at some parts grew the tall cacti; they were\r\none mass of gorgeous crimson bloom, and here and there between, the\r\nground was carpeted with trailing blossoms white and blue; yet, in my\r\nopinion, the laughing rosebud lips of Maggie and Jack's saucy eyes of\r\nblue were prettier far than the flowers.\r\n\r\n\"And here, on the top of the dingle or glen, and overlooking the sea,\r\nwere Napoleon's house and garden.\r\n\r\n\"`Why, James,' I cried, `this isn't a dungeon any more than Saint Helena\r\nis a rock.  It strikes me--a simple sailor--that Nap must have had fine\r\ntimes of it.'\r\n\r\n\"`No, sir, no,' said James, shaking his head.  `Plenty to eat and drink,\r\nplenty o' good clothes to wear, but ah!  Charles Halcott, he wasn't\r\nfree, and there burned inside him an unquenchable fire.  When in action,\r\non the field, or on the march, he had little time to think; but here, in\r\nthis solitude, the seared conscience regained its softness, and in his\r\nthoughts by day and in his dreams at the dead hours o' night, Charles\r\nHalcott, rose visions of the terrible misery he brought on Europe, and\r\nthe black and awful deeds he did in Egypt.  O sir, if you want to punish\r\na man, leave him alone to his conscience!'\r\n\r\n\"James Malone was in fine form that evening at Farmer Mac's.  He sang\r\nand he yarned time about--the songs for the children, the yarns for us.\r\nParodying Tam o' Shanter, I might say:--\r\n\r\n  \"`The nicht drave on wi' sangs and clatter,\r\n  Wi' childish glee, wi' bairnies' patter;\r\n  The sailor tauld his queerest stories,\r\n  The farmer's laugh was ready chorus;\r\n  Till, hark! the clock strikes in the hall\r\n  The wee short oor ayont the twal.'\r\n\r\n\"Before dinner that evening simple James had gone to see old Mother\r\nBanks, and he spent a whole hour with her.\r\n\r\n\"`Good-bye, dear laddie,' she said, when he rose to leave; `I'll pray\r\nfor ye on the ragin' sea, but I know the Lord will never let me behold\r\nye again.'\r\n\r\n\"And simple James's eyes were wet with tears as he held her skinny hand\r\nfor a moment, then dropped it and bore away up the street, never once\r\nlooking back, so full was his heart.\r\n\r\n\"When the clock struck one, James shyly proposed a few moments'\r\ndevotion.  Then he mounted the awful specs and opened the Good Book.\r\n\r\n\"Half an hour after this, all in the great house were asleep, and not a\r\nsound could I hear--for I lay long awake thinking--save the sighing of\r\nthe wind in the trees above my open jalousies, to me a very sweet and\r\nsoothing sound.\r\n\r\n\"`Heigho!'  I murmured to myself.  `Will I _ever_ have a home on the\r\ngreen earth, I wonder, or shall I die on the blue sea?'\r\n\r\n\"Then I began to doze, and mingling with my waking thoughts came dreams\r\nwhich proved that poor James's prescriptions had not yet been entirely\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"Just three weeks after this we were far away in the centre of the South\r\nAtlantic Ocean, and bearing up for Rio de Janeiro.  The sea around us\r\nwas of the darkest blue, but sparkling in the sunshine, and there was\r\njust sufficient wind to gladden the heart of a sailor.\r\n\r\n\"What induced James and me to change our plans and sail west instead of\r\nsouth and east, I never could tell, though I have often thought about\r\nit.  A friend of mine says it was Fate, and that Fate often rules the\r\ndestinies of men, despite all that can be done to alter her plans and\r\nintentions.  This line of reasoning may be right; my friend is so often\r\nright that I daresay it must be.\r\n\r\n\"But one thing now occurred to me that at times rendered me rather\r\nuneasy, and which, when I tried to describe it to James, caused that\r\nhonest sailor some anxiety also.  I have spoken of it more than once to\r\nso-called psychologists and even to so-called mediums; but their\r\nattempted explanations, although seemingly satisfactory enough to\r\nthemselves, sounded to me like a mere chaos of words, the meaning of\r\nwhich as a whole I never could fathom.  But the mystery with me was\r\nthis: I seemed at times to be possessed of a second self, or rather, a\r\nsecond soul.\r\n\r\n\"I struggled against the feeling all I could, but in vain.  James read\r\nhis mother's Bible to me, and otherwise, not in a spiritual way, he did\r\nall he could to cheer me up, as he phrased it.  But--and here comes in\r\nthe most curious part of it--I did not feel that I wanted any cheering\r\nup.  I was happy enough in the companionship of my second self.  This\r\nwas not always present.  Sometimes absent for days indeed, and never as\r\nyet did it talk to me in my dreams.  At other times it came, and would\r\nbe with me for hours; and it spoke to my mind as it were, I being\r\ncompelled to carry on a conversation, in thought, of course, but never\r\nonce did I have any notion beforehand as to what the remarks made were\r\nto be.  They were simple in the extreme, and usually had reference to\r\nthe working or guidance of the ship, the setting or shortening of sail,\r\nand making the good barque snug for the night.\r\n\r\n\"We called at Rio.  The harbour here could contain all the war fleets in\r\nthe world; grand old hills; a city as romantic as Edinburgh--that is,\r\nwhen seen from the sea--quaintness of streets, a wealth and beauty of\r\nvegetation, of treescape and flowerscape, that I have never seen\r\nequalled anywhere, and a quaintly dressed, quiet, and indolent people.\r\n\r\n\"We landed much stores here and filled up with others.  On the whole,\r\nJames and I were not sorry we had come, we drove such excellent\r\nbargains.\r\n\r\n\"Again, at Buenos Ayres, with its fine streets and public buildings, and\r\nits miles upon miles of shallow sea all in front, we did trade enough to\r\nplease us.\r\n\r\n\"`When I retire from sailing the salt seas, sir,' said James, `it's 'ere\r\nand nowhere else I'm goin' to make my 'ome; and I only wish the old lady\r\nwere livin', for then I'd retire after the very next voyage.'\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after resuming our voyage southwards towards the stormy Cape\r\nHorn, we encountered gale after gale of wind that taxed all the strength\r\nof our brave barque, as well as the skill of the officers and seamen.\r\nAgain and again had we to lie to for long dark days and nights; and when\r\nwe ventured to run before the storm, we had literally to stagger along\r\nunder bare poles.\r\n\r\n\"But when we reached the Cape at last, and stood away to the west around\r\nthe bleak and inhospitable shores of Tierra del Fuego, or the Land of\r\nFire, never before in all the years I had been to sea had I encountered\r\nweather so fearful or waves so high and dangerous.  So stormy, indeed,\r\ndid it continue, that hardly did either James or I dare to hope we\r\nshould ever double the Cape.  But we both had a sailor's aversion to\r\nturning back, and so struggled on and on.\r\n\r\n\"The danger seemed to culminate and the crisis come in earnest, when one\r\nweird moonlight midnight we suddenly found ourselves bows on to a huge\r\niceberg, or rather one vast island of ice that appeared to have no\r\nhorizon either towards the north or towards the south.  The barrier\r\npresented seemed impassable.  We could only try, so we put about on the\r\nport tack, the wind blowing there with great violence from the west and\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n\"This course took us well off the great ice island.  It took us\r\nsouthwards, moreover.\r\n\r\n\"`But why not steer northwards?' said James.  `We'd have to tack a bit,\r\nit is true, only we'd be lessening our danger; leastways that's my\r\nopinion.  This berg may be twenty or thirty miles long, and every mile\r\nbrings us closer to great bergs that, down yonder, float in dozens.\r\nBefore now, Charles Halcott, I've seen a ship sunk in the twinkling of a\r\nmarling-spike by a--'\r\n\r\n\"`By striking against a berg, James?'  I interrupted.  `So have I.'\r\n\r\n\"`No, sir, no; you're on the wrong tack.  Wherever big bergs are there\r\nare small ones too--little, hard, green lumps of ice, not bigger than\r\nthe wheel-house, that to hit bows on would scarcely spill your tea.\r\nBut, friend, it is different where there are mountain seas on.  These\r\nlittle green bergs are caught by a wave-top and hurled against the\r\nship's side with the strength of a thousand Titans.  And--the ship goes\r\ndown.'\r\n\r\n\"There was something almost solemn in the manner James brought out the\r\nlast four words.  It kept me silent for minutes; and shading my eyes\r\nwith my hand, I kept peering southwards into the weird-like moonshine,\r\nthe ice away on the right, a strange white haze to leeward, and far\r\nahead the foam-tipped waves, wild-maned horses of the ocean, careering\r\nalong on their awful course.\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I said at last, `danger or not danger, southwards I steer.\r\nSomething tells me to do so; everything bids me.  \"Steer south--steer\r\nsouth,\" chimes the bell when it strikes; \"steer south,\" ticks the clock.\r\nJames Malone, my very heart's pulse repeats the words; and I hear them\r\nmournfully sung by the very waves themselves, and by the wind that goes\r\nmoaning through the rigging.  And--I'm going to obey.'\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"For nights I had hardly slept a wink, but now I felt as if slumber\r\nwould soon visit my pillow if I but threw myself on the bed.  The moon,\r\na full round one, was already declining in the west when I went below\r\nand turned in all standing, and in three minutes' time I had sunk into a\r\ndeep and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\"James told me afterwards that it had taken him one long minute of solid\r\nshaking and shouting to arouse me, but he succeeded at last.\r\n\r\n\"`Anything wrong, James?'  I said anxiously, as I sat up in my cot.\r\n\r\n\"`Can't say as there's anything radically wrong, sir,' he replied\r\nslowly.  `Leastways, our ship's all right.  Wind and sea have both gone\r\ndown.  We've doubled the berg at last, and a good forty mile she was,\r\nand now we're nearing another.  But the strange thing is this, sir.\r\nThere is men on it, a-waving their coats and things, and makin' signs.\r\nI can just raise 'em with our Mons Meg glass.'\r\n\r\n\"`Some natives of Tierra del Fuego, perhaps,' I said.  `Anyhow, James,'\r\nI added, `keep bearing up towards them.'\r\n\r\n\"`Ay, ay, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"In ten minutes' time I was on deck, glass in hand.\r\n\r\n\"It was a grey uncertain morning, the sun just rising astern of us, and\r\ntingeing the wave-tops with a yellow glare.\r\n\r\n\"I could see the people on the ice with the naked eye.  But I steadied\r\nMons Meg on the bulwark, and had a look through that.\r\n\r\n\"`Mercy on us, James!'  I cried, `these are no savages, but our own\r\ncountrymen or Americans.  I can count five alive, and oh, James, three\r\nlie at some little distance stretched out dark and stiff.  Shake another\r\nreef out--those people want us.  A sad story will be theirs to tell.'\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"We got them all on board at last, though with difficulty, for the surf\r\nwas beating high above the snow-clad ice, and twice our boat was dashed\r\nagainst the hard, green edge of the monster berg, her timbers cracking\r\nominously.  We brought off the dead too, and buried them in a Christian\r\nway, James himself reading over them the beautiful service of the\r\nEnglish Church.  Though they were strangers to us, yet, as their bodies\r\ndropped down into the darkling sea, many a tear was shed that our\r\nfellows scarce took pains to hide.\r\n\r\n\"`And there they'll sleep,' said a voice behind me, `till the sea gives\r\nup its dead.'\r\n\r\n\"I turned slowly round, and the eyes of the speaker met mine.  Hitherto\r\nI had paid most attention to the lifeless, and scarce had noticed the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\"But now a strange thrill went through me as this man, who was the\r\nskipper of the lost ship, advanced with a sad kind of smile on his face\r\nand held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"`We have met before,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"`We seem to have met before,' I answered falteringly, `but where I\r\ncannot tell.  Perhaps you--'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, I can; I have seen you in a dream.  We must both have dreamt.'\r\n\r\n\"I staggered as if shot, and pressed my hand to my brow.\r\n\r\n\"`You seem puzzled,' he continued, `yet I am not.  I am a man who has\r\nstudied science somewhat.  I am often called a visionary on account of\r\nmy theories, yet I am convinced that there are times when, in answer to\r\nprayer, the mind during sleep may be permitted to leave the body.  You,\r\nsir, have saved the few poor fellows of my ship's crew who have escaped\r\ndeath, and I thank you.  Think nothing strange, sir, in this world\r\nsimply because you do not understand it.  But you have an errand of\r\nmercy yet to perform.  Heaven grant you may be as successful in that as\r\nyou have been in taking our poor helpless men from off the ice.'\r\n\r\n\"`Come below,' I said, `Captain--a--'\r\n\r\n\"`Smithson,' he put in.\r\n\r\n\"`Come below, Captain Smithson, and tell your story.  James, will you\r\nbear us company?'\r\n\r\n\"I and James sat on one side of the table, our guest, with his thin,\r\nworn face and dark eyes that seemed to pierce us with their very\r\nearnestness, on the other.  He told his story rapidly--ran over it, as\r\nit were, as a school-boy does something he has learned by heart.\r\n\r\n\"`It is but little more than five weeks since the good yacht _Windward_\r\ncleared away from San Francisco--'\r\n\r\n\"`James,' I said, interrupting him, `how long have we been at sea?'\r\n\r\n\"`Wellnigh four months, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"`How the time has flown!  Pray, sir, proceed.'\r\n\r\n\"`I have never known a quicker passage than we had.  The wind was fair\r\nall the way, and our little craft appeared to fly with it.  But it fell\r\ndead calm about the latitude of 20 degrees south of the line.  My only\r\npassengers--in fact, it was they who had chartered the _Windward_ to\r\ntake them to Monte Video--a lady and her daughter, began to be very\r\nuneasy now.  They had heard so much about the fleetness of the\r\n_Windward_ that they never expected a hitch.  No wonder they were\r\nuneasy.  Their business in Monte Video was a matter of life or death.\r\nThe doctor there had assured them that if they were not out by a certain\r\ntime, the husband and father would never again be seen by them alive.\r\n\r\n\"`But the calm was not of long duration.  Worse was to come--a tornado\r\nburst upon us with awful fury, and all but sunk us.  We were carried far\r\nto the west out of our course.  Fierce gales succeeded the tempest; and\r\nwhen the wind once more sank to rest we found ourselves surrounded by a\r\ngroup of islands that, although I have sailed the South Pacific for many\r\na long year, I had never seen before.\r\n\r\n\"`That the natives of the largest and most beautiful of these islands\r\nare savages and man-hunters I have not the slightest doubt.  The king\r\nhimself came off, evincing not the slightest fear of us; but both he and\r\nhis people remained so strangely pacific that it excited our suspicions\r\nfor a time.  We were glad, however, to be able here to repair damages\r\nand to take on board fresh water; and the kindness of the natives was so\r\nmarked that our suspicions were entirely lulled, and for days we lived\r\nalmost among them, even going on shore unarmed in the most friendly way.\r\n\r\n\"`I must tell you, sir, that, owing to the heat and closeness of the\r\natmosphere, a screen-berth or tent had been rigged for the ladies close\r\nto the bulwark on the port side, and almost abreast of the main-mast.\r\nThe first part of the night of the tenth was exceedingly dark, and it\r\nwas also hot and sultry.  The ladies had retired early, for a\r\nthunderstorm that had been threatening about sunset broke over us with\r\ntropical fury about ten by the clock, or four bells--the first watch.\r\n\r\n\"`And now, sir, comes the mystery.  The moon rose at twelve and silvered\r\nall the sea, shedding its earth light upon the green-wooded hills of the\r\nmainland till everything looked ethereal.  Not a sound was to be heard,\r\nexcept now and then the plaintive cry of a sea bird, and the dull, low\r\nmoan of the breakers on the coral sand.\r\n\r\n\"`As was her custom just before turning in, the ladies' maid drew aside\r\ntheir curtain to see if they wanted anything, and to say good-night.\r\n\r\n\"`I was walking the quarterdeck smoking, when pale and scared she rushed\r\ntoward me.\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!' she almost screamed, `they are gone!  The ladies have gone!'\r\n\r\n\"`No one thought of turning in that dreadful night; and when in the\r\nmorning the sun, red and flaming, leapt out of the sea, arming a boat as\r\nwell as I could, I rowed on shore and demanded audience of the king.\r\n\r\n\"`But we were not allowed to land.  The savages had assumed a very\r\ndifferent attitude now, and a shower of spears was our welcome.  One\r\npoor fellow was killed outright, another died of his wounds only an hour\r\nafterwards.  In fact, we were beaten off; and in an hour's time,\r\nobserving a whole fleet of boats coming off to attack our vessel, we\r\nwere forced to hoist sail and fly.\r\n\r\n\"`That is my story, and a sad one it is.  I was on my way to the nearest\r\ntown to seek assistance, when our vessel was crushed in the ice and sank\r\nin less than twenty minutes, with all on board except those you have\r\nseen.'\r\n\r\n\"Smithson was silent now.  With his chin resting on his hand he sat\r\nthere looking downwards at the deck, but apparently seeing nothing.  For\r\nmany minutes not a word was spoken by any one.  The vessel rose and fell\r\non the long, rolling seas; there was the creak of the rudder chains;\r\nthere was occasionally the flapping of a sail; all else was still.\r\n\r\n\"James Malone was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"`Charles Halcott,' he said--and I think I hear the earnest, manly tones\r\nof his voice at this moment--`Charles Halcott, we have a duty to\r\nperform, and it leads us to the northward and west.'\r\n\r\n\"I stood up now, and our hands met and clasped.\r\n\r\n\"`James Malone,' I replied, `Heaven helping us, we will perform that\r\nduty faithfully and well.'\r\n\r\n\"`Amen, sir!  Amen!'\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\n\"O MY FRIEND, MY BROTHER,\" I CRY.\r\n\r\n\"That same forenoon,\" continued Halcott, \"the wind went veering round to\r\nthe southward and east.  The sea was darkly, intensely blue all day.\r\nThe sky was intensely blue at night, and the stars so big and bright and\r\nnear they seemed almost to touch the topmasts.  But here and there in\r\nthe darkness, on every side of us, loomed white icebergs like sheeted\r\nghosts, and every now and then there rolled along our beam--thudding\r\nagainst the timbers as they swept aft--the smaller bergs or `bilts' we\r\ncould not avoid.\r\n\r\n\"James was on deck, and determined to remain there till morning, in\r\norder, as he said, to give me the quiet and rest my health so much\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"In two days' time we had weathered the stormy Cape, bidden farewell to\r\nthe ice, and, with every stitch of canvas set which it was possible to\r\ncarry safely, were sailing westward and north, away towards the distant\r\nislands of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"In a few days we got into higher latitudes, and the weather became\r\ndelightfully warm and pleasant.  The sky was more than Italian in its\r\nclear and cloudless azure; the rippling waves were all a-sparkle with\r\nlight; they kissed the bows of our bonnie barque, and came lapping and\r\nlaughing aft along our counter, their merry voices seeming to talk to us\r\nand bid us welcome to these sunny seas.\r\n\r\n\"Birds, too, came wheeling around our ship--strange, swift gulls, the\r\nlonesome frigate-bird, and the wondrous albatross, king of storms, great\r\neagle of the ocean wave.\r\n\r\n\"Had we not been upon the strange mission on which we were now bound,\r\nand the outcome of which we could not even guess, both James and I would\r\nhave enjoyed this delightful cruise; for, like myself, he was every inch\r\na sailor, and loved his ship as a landsman may love his bride.\r\n\r\n\"`In five days' time,' said Captain Smithson to me one forenoon, `if it\r\nholds like this, we ought to reach the Unfortunate Islands.'\r\n\r\n\"`Is that what you call them, captain?'  I said, smiling; `well, my\r\nfirst mate and I mean to change their name.'\r\n\r\n\"`Heaven grant you may,' he answered.  `O sir, the loss of this yacht,\r\nclipper though she was, and a beauty to boot, is nothing to mourn for--\r\nshe was well insured; even the death of my poor men is but an accident\r\nthat we sailors are liable to at any moment; but the fate of those two\r\ninnocent ladies--the mother so good and gentle, the daughter so\r\nchildlike and beautiful--is one that, if it is to remain a mystery, will\r\ncloud my whole life.  Think of it, sir.  The savages must have crept on\r\nboard in the midst of the thick darkness and the storm, crept on board\r\nlike wet and slimy snakes, gagged their poor victims, and borne them\r\nsilently away--to what?'\r\n\r\n\"`It is all very terrible,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"`Well, now,' said James, `it strikes me talkin' about it isn't goin' to\r\nhelp us.  Charles Halcott, I served on board a man-o'-war for seven\r\nyears.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, James.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, sir, I know what they'd do now in a case like this.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, James.'\r\n\r\n\"`They'd muster their forces, and prepare for 'ventualities.'\r\n\r\n\"`You see, gentlemen,' he added, `we may have a bit o' good, solid\r\nfightin' to do.  Heaven knows that, if it would do any good, I'd gird up\r\nmy loins and go all unarmed, save with the Word o' God--my mother's\r\nBible--among those poor, benighted heathens, and try to bring 'em to\r\ntheir senses.  But I fear that would do but little good.  When we go\r\namong the more humble and simple savages of lonely islands in the sea,\r\nor on the mainland of Africa itself, our work o' conversion is easy,\r\nbecause the creatures have no form o' religion to place against the\r\ngospel.  But these head-hunters--and I know them of old--have their own\r\nghastly, blood-stained rites and sacrifices--I cannot call it religion,\r\nsir--and these they set up as an awful barrier against the glad tidings\r\nwe fain would bring to their doors, to their lives.\r\n\r\n\"`No, gentlemen, we may have to crack skulls before we get the Word in.\r\nBut to save those helpless ladies Is a duty, a sacred duty we owe to our\r\nown white race, as well as to our own consciences, for we'd ne'er be\r\nhappy if we didn't try.'\r\n\r\n\"`Heaven grant,' I said, `they may still be alive!'\r\n\r\n\"`That we must find out,' said James.  `Now, sir, shall we call all\r\nhands, and see to rifles and ammunition?'\r\n\r\n\"James's suggestion was at once acted upon.\r\n\r\n\"The _Sea Flower_ was a very large barque, and once had been a\r\nfull-rigged ship.  And our hands were more numerous than are generally\r\ncarried, for many were working their voyage out, and might have been\r\ncalled passengers.\r\n\r\n\"So now forty bold fellows, including two strong and sturdy black men,\r\nand the negro boy we called the cook's mate, put in an appearance, and\r\ndrew shyly aft.  There were, in addition to these, Captain Smithson and\r\nhis four men.\r\n\r\n\"But these latter we determined the savages must not see, else their\r\nsuspicions would at once be raised, and, instead of our being able to\r\nact peacefully and by strategy, we should have at once to declare\r\nred-eyed war.\r\n\r\n\"`Will you speak first?'  I said to Captain Smithson.\r\n\r\n\"Without a word he strode forward, and, when he held up his hand, the\r\nmen came crowding round him.\r\n\r\n\"`Men of the _Sea Flower_!' he began, `I am going to tell you a story.\r\nIt is short and simple, but also a very sad one.  Maybe you know most of\r\nthe outs and ins and particulars of it already.  My men must have told\r\nyou all about our voyage and our lady passengers.'\r\n\r\n\"`Repeat, repeat!' cried the men; `we would have it all again from your\r\nown lips, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"Briefly and pathetically Smithson did so, relating to them all the\r\nparticulars we already know.\r\n\r\n\"`Men,' he continued, `you are Christians, and you are Englishmen.  It\r\nis on this latter fact I rely chiefly, in case we have to fight with the\r\nsavages of those Unfortunate Islands.  The elder of the two ladies we\r\nare going to try to save is English, though she married an American,\r\nthough her home was on the Pacific slope, and her innocent and beautiful\r\ndaughter was born in San Francisco.  They are your country-people, then,\r\nas much as ours.  But, apart from that, when I say they are women in\r\nbondage and distress, I have said enough, I know, to appeal to the brave\r\nheart of every Englishman who now stands before me.'\r\n\r\n\"A wild, heroic shout was the only reply.\r\n\r\n\"`Thank you,' said Smithson, `for that expression of feeling! and I will\r\nonly add that these ladies, especially the younger, were, all the way\r\nout, the light and life of our poor, lost yacht, and that, by their\r\nwinning ways, they made themselves beloved both fore and aft.'\r\n\r\n\"`Now, lads,' cried James, and as he spoke he seemed a head taller than\r\nI had ever seen him, `if we've got to fight, why, then, we'll fight.\r\nBut against these terrible savages we can't fight with porridge-sticks.\r\nLuckily, in our cargo we have a hundred good rifles, and that is two for\r\neach of us; and we have revolvers, too, and plenty of ammunition.  All\r\ngood, mind you; for I chose the whole cargo myself.  So now, bo's'n,\r\npipe up the guns; and this afternoon, men, and every day till we touch\r\nat the Unfortunate Islands, I'll put you through your drill--which,\r\nbein' an old navy man, I fancy I'm capable of doing.  Are you all\r\nwilling?'\r\n\r\n\"The cheer that shook the ship from stem to stern was a truly British\r\none.  It was their only answer, and the only answer needed or required.\r\n\r\n\"So the drilling was commenced, and entered into with great spirit.\r\nAfter all, this drill was merely preparation for `possible\r\n'ventualities,' as honest James called it, for fighting would be our\r\nvery last resort, and we earnestly prayed that we might not be driven to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"At last, and early one morning, just as the sun was beginning to pencil\r\nthe feathery clouds with gold and green and crimson, land was discovered\r\non the lee bow.\r\n\r\n\"I brought the big telescope which James had named Mons Meg to bear upon\r\nit.  Then I handed Meg to Smithson.  He looked at the land long and\r\nearnestly, and glanced up at me with beaming face.\r\n\r\n\"`That's the principal island, Captain Halcott,' he said; `the king's\r\nown.  How well we have hit it!'\r\n\r\n\"That same forenoon we cast anchor in Treachery Bay, close to the spot\r\nwhere the yacht had lain not many weeks before.\r\n\r\n\"Our sails were furled in quite a business-like way.  We wanted to show\r\nthe savages that we were not one whit afraid of them, that we had come\r\nto stay for a short spell, and hadn't the remotest intention of running\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"That you may better understand the shape or configuration of this\r\nstrange island, gentlemen, here I show you a rough sketch-map.  This\r\nwill enable you also to follow more easily our subsequent adventures in\r\nthe fastnesses of these terrible savages.\r\n\r\n\"Rude and simple though this plan is, a word or two will suffice to\r\nexplain it.  The island trends west and east, and is not more than\r\nsixteen miles long by about ten to twelve in width.  It is divided into\r\ntwo almost equal parts by a very rapid and dark-rolling river, which\r\nrushes through rocky gorges with inconceivable speed, forming many a\r\nthundering cataract as it fights its way to the sea.  It is fed from the\r\nwaters that flow from the mountains, and, probably, by subterranean\r\nsprings.  The whole western portion of the island, with the exception of\r\nsome green woods around the bay, is pretty low, but covered throughout\r\nwith the remains of a black and burned forest.  This forest is supposed\r\nby the natives to be inhabited by fearsome demons and witches, and is\r\nnever visited, except for the purpose of sorcery by the medicine-men of\r\nthe tribe, and to bury the dead.  In the centre of the eastern portion\r\nof the island, which is beautifully clad with woodlands, and rugged and\r\nwild in the extreme, is a lake with one small, lonely isle; and around\r\nthis the mountains tower their highest, but are clad to their very\r\nsummits with forest trees, many of them bearing the most luscious of\r\nfruits, and all draped with wild flowers, and sweetly haunted by bird\r\nand bee.\r\n\r\n\"The only things else in the map I wish to draw your attention to,\r\ngentlemen, are the parallel lines.  These mark the spot where was the\r\nonly bridge leading into the fastnesses of these savages, and the only\r\nmode of communication with the lower land and bay, without walking round\r\nby the head of the river, or following its course to the sea and\r\ncrossing in a boat.\r\n\r\n\"This bridge was primitive in the extreme, consisting merely of three\r\nstraight tree stems, and a rude life-line composed of the twisted withes\r\nof a kind of willow.\r\n\r\n\"I have sad reason to remember that bridge, and shall not forget it\r\nwhile life lasts.\r\n\r\n\"I have said nothing in my story yet about Lord Augustus Fitzmantle.\r\nBut it is time to do so.  Lord Augustus was our cook's mate.  It is well\r\nto give a nigger boy a high-sounding name, and, if possible, a title.\r\nHe always tries to act up to it.  Lord Augustus was very, very black.\r\nThe other niggers were black enough certainly, but they looked brown\r\nbeside his merry, laughing little lordship.  Yes, always laughing,\r\nalways showing those white teeth of his and rolling his expressive eyes,\r\nand good-tempered all day long.  Even a kick from the cook only made him\r\nrub a little and laugh the more.  Lord Augustus wore a string of\r\nsky-blue beads about his neck, and on warm days he wore very little\r\nelse.  But if Lord Augustus was black, he was also bright.  The sunshine\r\nglittered and glanced on his rounded arms and cheeks, and he had\r\nsunshine in his heart as well.  It goes without saying he was the pet of\r\nthe _Sea Flower_ and everybody's friend, and though all hands teased as\r\nwell as petted him, he took it all in good part.\r\n\r\n\"So long as Lord Fitzmantle kept his mouth shut, and didn't show those\r\nflashing teeth of his, he was as invisible as Jack the Giant Killer on a\r\ndark night.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"Seeing our independence, the savages for hours held aloof.  At last a\r\nwhite-headed, fearful-looking old man paddled alongside in a dug-out.\r\nFrom the fact that he had a huge snake coiled around his chest and neck,\r\nI took him to be the medicine-man, or sorcerer, of the tribe, and I was\r\nnot mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"He was certainly no beauty as he sat there grinning in his dark\r\ndug-out.  His face was covered with scars in circles and figures, so,\r\ntoo, was his chest; his eyes were the colour of brass; his teeth\r\ncrimson, and filed into the form of triangles.  But he climbed boldly on\r\nboard when beckoned to, and we loaded him with gifts of pretty beads,\r\nand engirdled his loins with red cloth, then sent him grinning away.\r\n\r\n\"This treatment had the desired effect, and in half an hour's time the\r\nbay was alive with the boats and canoes of the head-hunters.  Each of\r\ntheir tall, gondola-like prows bore a grinning skull, the cheek bones\r\ndaubed with a kind of crimson clay, and the sockets filled with awful\r\nclay eyes--not a pretty sight.\r\n\r\n\"Presently the king himself came off, and we received him with great\r\nceremony, and gave him many gifts.  To show our strength, James drew up\r\nhis men in battle array, and to the terror of all in the boats, they\r\nfired their guns, taking aim at some brown and ugly kites that flew\r\naround.  When several of these fell dead, the alarm of the king knew no\r\nbounds.  But he soon recovered; and when, a little later on, I with a\r\ndozen of my best men went on shore, the king placed a poor slave girl on\r\nthe beach and made signs for us to shoot.  I would sooner have shot the\r\nking himself.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Augustus came with us, and we soon found that he understood much\r\nthat the king said, and could therefore act as our interpreter.\r\n\r\n\"It is needless to say that the men of the lost yacht were kept out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"Our walk that day was but a brief one.  The king did not seem to want\r\nus ever to cross the bridge.  On climbing a hill, however, I could see\r\nall over the wild and beautiful country.  I pointed to the lake and\r\nlittle island, and was given to understand that the medicine-men dwelt\r\nthere.  But from the shiftiness of the savage's eyes, I concluded at\r\nonce that, if they were alive, that was the prison isle of the unhappy\r\nladies.  The king dined with us next day, and we considered it policy to\r\nlet him have a modicum of fire-water.  His heart warmed, and not only\r\ndid he permit our party to cross the bridge, but to visit his palace.\r\nThe sights of horror around it I will not dare to depict, but, much to\r\nmy joy, I noticed from the king's veranda the flutter of white dresses\r\non the little prison isle.\r\n\r\n\"My mind was made up, and that night I dispatched Lord Augustus on shore\r\nwith a note.  It was a most hazardous expedition, and none save the boy\r\ncould have undertaken it with any hope of success.  In my letter I had\r\ntold the ladies to be of good cheer; there would be a glimmer of\r\nmoonlight in a week's time, and that then we should attempt their\r\nrescue; anyhow they were to be prepared.\r\n\r\n\"Three whole days elapsed, and yet no Lord Augustus appeared, but on the\r\nnight of the fourth, when we had given him up for lost, he swam off to\r\nthe ship.  Poor boy, he had hardly eaten food, save fruit, since he had\r\nleft, and his adventure had been a thrilling one.  Yet he was laughing\r\nall over just the same.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he had managed to give the note, and had brought back a message.\r\nThe ladies had not, strange to say, been subjected to either insult or\r\ninjury by the king.  They were well fed on fruit and milk and cooked\r\nfowls, but were guarded day and night by priests.\r\n\r\n\"The most startling portion of the message, however, was this: in a\r\nfortnight's time a great feast and sacrifice were to take place, and\r\nduring that they knew not what might occur.  They begged that the boy\r\nmight be sent again, and with him a sleeping-powder, which they might\r\nadminister to the priests on the night of the attempted rescue.  I\r\nconfess my heart beat high with anxiety when the boy told us all this,\r\nfor not one word of his message had he forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"I consulted now with James and Smithson.  Would it not be as well, I\r\nadvanced, to attempt to rescue the ladies by force?\r\n\r\n\"This was at once vetoed.  Both James and the captain of the yacht knew\r\nmore of savage nature than I did, and they most strongly affirmed that\r\nany show of force would assuredly result in the putting to death of the\r\ntwo unhappy ladies we had come to rescue.\r\n\r\n\"So it was finally agreed that stratagem, not force, must be resorted\r\nto, in the first place, at all events.  So a night was chosen, and on\r\nthe previous evening faithful Lord Fitzmantle was dispatched once more,\r\ntaking with him a powder for the medicine-men, or priests.\r\n\r\n\"To our great joy and relief, the messenger returned before daylight\r\nwith the news that all would be ready, and that they, the ladies, would\r\nbe found at midnight in a cave by the banks of the lake, if they were\r\nsuccessful in escaping in a canoe from the island.\r\n\r\n\"`And you know this cave, Fitz?'  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Fitz's eyes snapped and twinkled right merrily.\r\n\r\n\"`I done know him, him foh true, sah!' he said, which signified that he\r\nhad a perfect knowledge of the position of the cave.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"As I speak to you even now, gentlemen, a portion of the anxiety I felt\r\non that terrible night when, with muffled oars, our boat left the ship,\r\ncomes stealing over my senses.  I could not tell then why my feelings\r\nshould be worked up to so high a pitch, for I'd been in many a danger\r\nand difficulty before.  But so it was.\r\n\r\n\"The king had dined with us, and we sent home with him a supply of\r\nfire-water, which has worked such ruin among many savage races.  But\r\nsurely on this occasion we were partially justified in doing so.  We\r\nknew, therefore, that the king and some of his principal officers were\r\nsafe enough for one night.\r\n\r\n\"The largest boat was cautiously lowered about an hour before midnight,\r\nwhen everything was still as the grave on the island; a long and\r\nplaintive howl, however, being borne on the gentle breeze towards us\r\nevery now and then, telling us that sentries were here and there in the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\"We were fifteen men in all, including James and myself, and excluding\r\nour little black guide, Lord Fitzmantle.  During the nights of terror he\r\nhad spent in hill and forest he had surveyed the country well, and so we\r\ncould safely trust to him.\r\n\r\n\"We rowed with muffled oars to the beach near the haunted forest, and\r\ndrew up our boat under some banana-trees; then, silent as the red men of\r\nthe North American forests, we made our way towards the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"The moon was about five days old, and served to give us all the light\r\nwe desired.  We took advantage of every bush and thicket, and finally,\r\nwhen within seventy yards of the river--the hustling and roaring of\r\nwhich we could distinctly hear--we dispatched little Fitz to\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\n\"He returned in a few minutes and reported all safe, and no one on watch\r\nupon the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"We marched now in Indian file, taking care not even to snap a twig,\r\nlest we should arouse the slumbering foe.  I do not know how long we\r\ntook to reach the cave.  To me, in my terror and anxiety, it seemed a\r\nyear.  They were there, and safe.\r\n\r\n\"We waited not a moment to speak.  I lifted the young lady in my arms.\r\nHow light she was!  James escorted the elder, sometimes carrying her,\r\nsometimes permitting her to walk.\r\n\r\n\"Then the journey back was commenced.\r\n\r\n\"But in the open a glimmer of moonlight fell on the face of the\r\nbeautiful burden I bore.  She had fainted.  That I could see at a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"But something more I saw, and, seeing, tottered and nearly fell; for\r\nhers was the same lovely and childlike face I had seen that evening,\r\nwhich now appeared so long ago, in the Liverpool theatre.\r\n\r\n\"I felt now as if walking in the air.  But I cannot describe or express\r\nmy feelings, being only a sailor, and so must not attempt to.\r\n\r\n\"We might have still been a hundred yards from the bridge and river,\r\nwhen suddenly there rang out behind and on each side of us the most\r\nawful yells I had ever listened to, while the beating of tom-toms, or\r\nwar-drums, sounded all over the eastern part of the island.\r\n\r\n\"`On, men, on to the bridge!' shouted brave James.  No need for\r\nconcealment now.\r\n\r\n\"It was a short but fearful race, but now we are on it, on the bridge!\r\n\r\n\"On and over!\r\n\r\n\"All but James!\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?  The moon escapes from behind a cloud and shines full upon\r\nhis sturdy form, still on the other side, and at the same time we can\r\nhear the sharp ring of his revolver.  Then, oh! we see him tearing up\r\nthe planks of the bridge, and dropping them one by one into the gulf\r\nbeneath.  We pour in a volley to keep the savages back.\r\n\r\n\"`Fly for your lives!' shouts brave James.  `Save the ladies; I'll\r\nswim.'\r\n\r\n\"Next minute he dives into the chasm!  For one brief moment we see his\r\nface and form in the pale moonlight.  Then he disappears.  He is gone.\r\n\r\n\"`O my friend, my brother!'  I cry, stretching out my arms as if I would\r\nplunge madly into the pool that lies far beneath yonder, part in shade\r\nand part in shine.\r\n\r\n\"But they dragged me away by main force.  They led me to the boat.  The\r\nsavages could not follow.  But I seemed to see nothing now, to know\r\nnothing, to feel nothing, except that I had lost the dearest friend on\r\nearth.  He had sacrificed himself to save us!\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\n\"I THINK YOU'RE GOING ON A WILD-GOOSE CHASE.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott paused, and gazed seawards over the great stretch of wet beach.\r\n\r\nSo wet was it that the sun's parting rays lit it up in great stripes of\r\ncrimson chequered with gold.\r\n\r\nAnd yonder are the children coming slowly home across these painted\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nA strange group, most certainly, but united in one bond of union--oh,\r\nwould that all the world were so!--the bond of love.\r\n\r\nThe brother's arm is placed gently around his sister's waist; the\r\nAdmiral is stepping drolly by Ransey's side, with his head and neck\r\nthrust through the lad's arm.\r\n\r\nSomething seems to tell the bird that fate, which took away his master\r\nbefore, might take him once again.\r\n\r\nBob brings up the rear.  His head is low towards the sands, but he feels\r\nvery happy and satisfied with his afternoon's outing.\r\n\r\nHalcott once more lit his pipe.\r\n\r\nThe two others were silent, and Mr Tandy nodded when Halcott smiled and\r\nlooked towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"there is a little more of my story yet untold; there is\r\na portion of it still in the future, I trust.  With this, however,\r\ndestiny alone has to do.  Suffice it to say, that as far as Doris and\r\nmyself--my simple sailor-self--are concerned, we shall be married when I\r\nreturn from my next cruise, if all goes well, and, like two vessels\r\nleaving the harbour on just such a beautiful night as this, sail away to\r\nbegin our voyage of life on just such a beautiful sea.\r\n\r\n\"You must both know Doris before I start.  But where, think you, do I\r\nmean to sail to next?  No, do not answer till I tell you one thing.\r\nNeither Doris nor her mother received, while in that little lake island,\r\nthe slightest injury or insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is some good in the breast of even the wildest savage,\" put\r\nin Weathereye.  \"I always thought so; bother me if I didn't.  Ahem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, wait, Captain Weathereye, wait!  I fear my experience is different\r\nfrom yours.  Those fiendish savages on that Isle of Misfortune were\r\nreserving my dear Doris and her mother for a fate far more terrible than\r\nanything ever described in books of imagination.\r\n\r\n\"We rescued them, by God's mercy, just in time.  They were then under\r\nthe protection of the awful priests, or medicine-men, and were being fed\r\non fruits and on the petals of rare and beautiful flowers.  Their hut\r\nitself was composed of flowers and foliage.\r\n\r\n\"The king, no, not even he, could come near them, until the medicine-men\r\nhad propitiated the demons that live, according to their belief, in\r\nevery wood and in every ravine and gully in the island.\r\n\r\n\"Then, at the full of the moon, on that tiny islet I have marked on the\r\nmap, the king and his warriors would assemble at midnight, and the awful\r\norgies would commence.\r\n\r\n\"I shudder even now when I think of it.  I happily cannot describe to\r\nyou the tortures these poor ladies would have been put to before the\r\nfinal, fearful act.  But the king would drink `white blood.'  He would\r\nthen be invulnerable.  No foe could any more prevail against him.\r\n\r\n\"While the blood was still flowing, the stake-fires would-be lit, and--\r\n\r\n\"But I'll say no more; a cannibal feast would have concluded the\r\nceremonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say,\" cried Weathereye, bringing his fist, and a good-sized\r\none it was, down with a bang on the sill of the open window by which he\r\nsat--\"do you mean to tell me that these devils incarnate would have\r\nburned the poor dear ladies alive, then?  Oh, horrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that they meant to; but look at this!\"\r\n\r\nHe handed Weathereye a small yellow dagger.\r\n\r\n\"What a strange little knife!  But why, I say, Halcott, Tandy, this\r\nknife is made of gold--solid, hammered gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Halcott; \"and it is this dagger of hammered gold that would\r\nhave saved my poor Doris and her mother from the torture and the stake.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he added, \"not this dagger only, but every implement in the cave\r\nof those fearsome priests was fashioned from the purest gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed a strange story,\" said Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" added Halcott, \"can you guess to what seas my\r\nbarque shall sail next?\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTandy rose from his seat and took two or three turns up and down the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who made up his mind quickly enough, and it is such men as\r\nthese, and only such, who get well on in the world.\r\n\r\nWeathereye and Halcott both kept silence.  They were watching Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"Halcott,\" said the latter, approaching the captain of the _Sea\r\nFlower_--\"Halcott, have you kept your secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"Secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I mean, do many save yourself know of the existence of gold on\r\nthat island of blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"None save me.  No one has even seen the knife but myself and you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.  You love the _Sea Flower_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love the _Sea Flower_ as every sailor loves, or ought to love, his\r\nship.  I wish I could afford to buy her out and out.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other shares are in the market then?\"\r\n\r\nTandy was seated now cross-legged on a chair, and leaning over the back\r\nof it, bending towards Halcott with an earnest light, in his eyes, such\r\nas few had ever seen therein.\r\n\r\n\"The other shares _are_ for sale,\" said Halcott.\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that Ransey Tansey and little Nelda came, or\r\nrather burst into the room.  Both were breathless, both were rosy; and\r\nBob, who came in behind them, was panting, with half a yard of tongue--\r\nwell, perhaps, not _quite_ so much--hanging red over his alabaster\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\"O daddy,\" cried Babs, as father still called her, \"we've had such fun!\r\nAnd the 'Ral,\" (a pet name that the crane had somehow obtained\r\npossession of) \"dug up plenty of pretty things for us, and he wanted Bob\r\nto eat a big white worm, only Bob wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his children stood on each side of him, and he had placed one arm\r\nround each.\r\n\r\nThus Tandy faced Halcott once more, smiling, perhaps, a little sadly\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ can buy those shares, Halcott.  Do not think me ambitious.  A\r\nmoney-grabber I never was.  But, you see these little tots.  Ransey here\r\ncan make his way in the world.--Can't you, Ransey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather, father,\" said Ransey.\r\n\r\n\"But, Halcott, though I am not in the flower of my youth, I'm in the\r\nprime of my manhood, and I'd do everything I know to build up a shelter\r\nfor my little Babs against the cold winds of adversity before I--But I\r\nmust not speak of anything sad before the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a long life before you, I trust,\" said Weathereye.\r\n\r\nTandy seemed to hear him not.\r\n\r\n\"I'd go as your mate.\"\r\n\r\nThe two sailors shook hands.\r\n\r\n\"You'll go as my friend, and keep watch if you choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried Weathereye.  \"Shiver my jib, as sailors say in books, if\r\nI wouldn't like to go along with both of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Captain Weathereye?\"\r\n\r\nThe staff-commander laughed.  \"Not this cruise, lads, though I'm not\r\nafraid for my life, or the little that may be left of it, and you must\r\ntake care of yours.  I think myself you are going on a kind of\r\nwild-goose chase, and that the goose--that is, the gold--will have the\r\nbest of it, by keeping out of your way.  Well, anyhow, I'll come and see\r\nyou both over the bar.  Where do you sail from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Southampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! and the last person you'll see as you drop out to sea will be old\r\nWeathereye in a boat waving his red bandana to wish you luck.\r\nGood-night!\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, little Babs!  How provokingly pretty she is, Tandy! better\r\nleave her at Scragley Hall, and the crane too.  She'll be well looked\r\nafter, you may figure upon that.  Come and give the old man a kiss,\r\ndear.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nelda hung her head.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you say that, Captain Weathereye.  Wherever _ever_ daddy goes, I\r\ngo with him.  I'm _not_ going to let my brother run away to sea and\r\nleave me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you won't give me Bob?\" said Weathereye.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _no_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor the Admiral?\"\r\n\r\nNelda looked up in the old captain's face now.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just real sorry for you,\" she said; \"but the Hal's going and\r\nall--_you_ may figure on that.\"\r\n\r\nWeathereye laughed heartily.\r\n\r\nThen he drew the child gently towards him and kissed her little\r\nsun-browned hand.\r\n\r\n\"May God be with you, darling, where'er on earth you roam!  And with you\r\nall.  Good-night again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd away went honest Captain Weathereye.\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nAT SEA--MERMAIDS AND MERMEN.\r\n\r\nSo long as the wind blew free, even though it did not always blow fair,\r\nthere was joy, and jollity, too, in every heart that beat on board the\r\nsaucy _Sea Flower_, fore as well as aft.\r\n\r\nShe looked a bonnie barque now, in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nTandy and Halcott had spared neither expense nor pains in rigging her\r\nwell out.  Had not her timbers been stanch and sound they certainly\r\nwould not have done so.\r\n\r\nShe had new sails, a new jibboom, and several new spars; and before she\r\ngot clear and away out of the English Channel the crew of many a\r\nhomeward-bound ship manned their riggings and gave her a hearty cheer.\r\n\r\nHalcott had left the whole rig-out of the _Sea Flower_ to Mr Tandy, and\r\nhad not come near her for six long weeks.\r\n\r\nHe was better employed, perhaps, and more happy on shore.  But pleased\r\nenough he was on his return.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tandy, my dear fellow, this isn't a ship any more; it's a yacht?\"\r\n\r\n\"A pot of paint and a bucket of tar go a long way,\" Tandy replied\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there's a good deal more than tar here; but how you've managed to\r\nget her decks and spars so white and beautiful, bother me if I can tell.\r\nAnd her ebony is ebony no longer, it is polished jet, while her brass\r\nwork is gold.\"\r\n\r\nDown below the two had now gone together.\r\n\r\nTandy could not have made the cabin a bit bigger if he had tried, but he\r\nhad removed every morsel of her lumbering old lockers and tables, and\r\nrefurnished it with all he could think of that was graceful and\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nMirrors, too, were everywhere along the bulk-heads, and these made the\r\nsaloon look larger.  The only wonder is that, in a lit of\r\nabsent-mindedness, some one did not walk right through a mirror.\r\n\r\nHanging tables, beautiful crystal, brackets, and artificial flowers gave\r\na look that was both lightsome and gay.\r\n\r\nOn the port side, when you touched a knob, a mirrored door opened into\r\nthe captain's cabin--small but pretty, and lighted by an airy port that\r\ncould be carried open in good weather, and all along in the trades.\r\n\r\nThe other state-room was larger.  This Halcott had insisted upon Tandy\r\ntaking; and it contained not only his own bunk, but a lower one for\r\nNelda, and was better decorated and furnished than even the captain's.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gaily goes the ship when the wind blows free.\"\r\n\r\nAnd right gaily she had gone too, as yet.\r\n\r\nHalcott was a splendid sailor and navigator.  It might have been\r\nthought, however, that Tandy, from his long residence on shore, had\r\nturned a little rusty in his seamanship.\r\n\r\nIf he had, the rust had not taken long to rub off; and as he trod the\r\nivory-white quarterdeck in his duck trousers, neat cap, and jacket of\r\nnavy blue, he really looked ten years younger than in the days when he\r\nsailed the _Merry Maiden_ up and down the canal.\r\n\r\nThe crew were well-dressed, and looked happy and jolly enough for\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that Nelda was the pet of the _Sea Flower_, fore and\r\naft.  There was no keeping the child to any one part of the ship.  In\r\nfine weather--and, with the exception of a \"howther\" in the Bay, it had\r\nup till now been mostly fine--she was here, there, and everywhere: in\r\nthe men's quarters; down below in the forecastle; at the forecastle-head\r\nitself, when the men leaned over the bows there, smoking, yarning, and\r\nlaughing; and in the cook's galley, helping to make the soup.  But she\r\nventured even further than this, and more than once her father started\r\nto find her in the foretop, and standing beside her that tall,\r\nimperturbable Admiral.\r\n\r\nThe bird was pet number two; but Bob made an equal second.\r\n\r\nAt first the 'Ral was inclined to mope.  Perhaps he was sea-sick.  It is\r\na well-known fact that if a Cape pigeon, as a certain gull is called, is\r\ntaken on board, it can fly no more, but walks slowly and stupidly round\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\nSea-sickness had not troubled Bob in the slightest.  When he saw the\r\n'Ral standing in the lee-scuppers, with his neck hitched right round\r\ntill the head lay right on the top of his tail, Bob looked at him\r\ncomically with _his_ head cocked funnily to one side.\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to laugh right away down both sides, so to speak.  Bob\r\nwas a droll dog.\r\n\r\n\"My eyes, Admiral,\" he said, \"what a ridiculous figure you do cut, to be\r\nsure!  Why, at first I couldn't tell which was the one end of you and\r\nwhich was the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what becomes of me,\" the Admiral replied, talking over his\r\ntail.  \"It is a very ordinary world.  I'll never dance again.\"\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, in three days' time the Hal did dance, and so droll\r\nand comical were his capers on the heaving deck that the crew lay aft in\r\na body and laughed till they nearly burst their belts.  The Admiral took\r\nkindly to his meal-worms after that, and didn't despise potted salmon\r\nand morsels of mutton.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow it must not be supposed that the _Sea Flower_ was going out in\r\nballast, on the mere chance of filling up with gold.  They might never\r\nsee the Isle of Misfortune, and all their dreams of gold might yet turn\r\nout as dreams so often do.\r\n\r\nHalcott and Tandy were good sailors, and but little likely to trust\r\novermuch to blind chance.  They took out with them, therefore, a\r\ngood-paying cargo of knick-knacks and notions to barter with the natives\r\nalong the coast of Africa.  Having made a good voyage--and they knew\r\nthey should--and having filled up with copal, nutmegs, arrowroot,\r\nspices, ivory, and perhaps even gold-dust and ostrich feathers from the\r\nfar interior, they would stretch away out and over the broad Atlantic,\r\nand rounding the Horn, make search for the Isle of Misfortune, which\r\nthey hoped to find an island of gold.\r\n\r\nIf unsuccessful, they should then bear up for the northern Pacific\r\nIslands, taking their chance of doing something with pearls or\r\nmother-of-pearl, and so on and away to San Francisco, where they were\r\nsure of a market, even if they wished to sell the _Sea Flower_ herself.\r\n\r\nBut the best of sailors get disheartened far sooner in calms than even\r\nin tempests.\r\n\r\nIn the latter, one has all the excitement of a battle with the elements;\r\nin the former, one can but wait and think and long for the winds to\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n  \"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,\r\n  The furrow followed free.\"\r\n\r\nYes; but although in the region of calms some ships seem to have luck,\r\nthe _Sea Flower_ had none.\r\n\r\n  \"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,\r\n  'Twas sad as sad could be;\r\n  And they did speak only to break\r\n  The silence of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nA week, a fortnight, nearly three weary weeks went past like this.\r\n\r\nThere was no singing now forward among the men.  Even little Fitz the\r\nnigger, who generally _was_ trolling a song, at times high over the roar\r\nof the wind, was silent now.  So, too, was Ransey Tansey.  He and Nelda\r\nhad been before the life of the good ship.  It seemed as if they should\r\nnever be so again.  Bob took to lying beside the man at the wheel.  As\r\nfar as the latter was concerned, there might just as well have been no\r\nman there at all.  The sea all round was a sea of heaving oil.  The\r\nwaves were houses high--not long rollers, but a series of hills and\r\nvalleys, in which the _Sea Flower_ wallowed and tumbled; while the\r\nfierce heat of the sun caused the pitch to melt and bubble where the\r\ndecks were not protected by an awning.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the good ship was far indeed from agreeable.  Any seaman\r\ncan walk easily even when half a gale of wind is roaring through the\r\nrigging.  There is a method in the motion of a ship in such a sea-way.\r\nThere is no method in the motion of a vessel in the doldrums; and when\r\none puts one's foot down on the quarterdeck, or, rather, where it seemed\r\nto be a second before, it finds but empty space.  The body lurches\r\nforward, and the deck swings up to receive it.  A grasp at a stay or\r\nsheet alone can avert a fall.\r\n\r\nIn such a sea-way there is no longer any leeward or windward.  The sails\r\ngo flapping to and fro, however: they are making wind for themselves as\r\nthe vessel rolls and tumbles; and if this wind carries her forward a few\r\nyards one minute, it hurls her back again the next.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Nelda often asked her father if the wind would never, never\r\nblow again, or whether it would be always, always like this.\r\n\r\nNo birds either, save now and then a migrant gull that floated lazily on\r\na wave to rest, or perched on the fin of a basking shark.\r\n\r\nSo day after day passed wearily on, and you could not have told one day\r\nfrom the other.  But when, at six o'clock, the sun hurriedly capped the\r\ngreat heaving waves with crimson, leaving the hollows in deepest purple\r\nshade, and soon after sank, then, in the gloaming that for a brief spell\r\nhung over the ocean, the stars came out; and very brightly did they\r\nshine, so that night was even more pleasant than day.\r\n\r\nBanks of clouds sometimes lay along the horizon.  By day they appeared\r\nlike far-off, snow-capped, serrated mountains; at night they were dark,\r\nbut lit up every few moments by flashes of lightning, which spread out\r\nbehind them and revealed their form and shape.\r\n\r\nNo thunder ever followed this lightning; it brought no wind; nor did the\r\nclouds ever rise or bring a drop of rain.\r\n\r\nPhantom lightning; phantom clouds!\r\n\r\nThere were times on nights like these when Ransey took his sister on\r\ndeck to look at the sky, and wonder at the lightning and that strange\r\nmountain-range of clouds.\r\n\r\nShe was not afraid when Ransey was with her.  But she would not have\r\ngone \"upstairs,\" as she called it, with even the stewardess herself.\r\n\r\nRansey, I may mention, lived in the saloon with his father and the\r\ncaptain, the second and third mates having comfortable quarters in the\r\nmidship decks.\r\n\r\nA stewardess only was carried on the _Sea Flower_, and she acted in\r\nanother capacity--that of maid to Nelda.  A black girl she was, but\r\nclean, smart, and tidy and trim, full of merriment and good-nature.  Her\r\nassistant was Fitz, and with him alone she deemed it her duty to be a\r\nlittle harsh now and then.  Because Fitz wouldn't keep his place, so she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nPoor Janeira, she always forgot she was a nigger herself, seeing so many\r\nwhite faces all around her.  But when she looked into the little mirror\r\nthat hung in her pantry, she used to go into fits of laughter at her\r\nface therein displayed.  She was a funny girl.\r\n\r\nRansey used to take Nelda up on these nights, and hoist her on to the\r\ngrating abaft the quarterdeck, and she would cling to his arm, while he\r\nheld on to the bulwark.\r\n\r\nThus they would stand, silent and awed, for long minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nWas there nothing to break the dread stillness?  There was occasionally\r\nthe flap of a sail, or a footstep forward; but no song from the men, no\r\nloud talking--they hardly cared to speak above a whisper.  But more than\r\nonce a plash was heard, and a great dark head would appear from the side\r\nof a billow, seen distinctly enough in the gleam of the starlight, then\r\nsink and disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the awful beast, 'Ansey!  Can it climb up and swallow us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear silly, no.\"\r\n\r\nBut older people than Nelda have been frightened by such dread spectres\r\nappearing close to a ship at night while in the doldrums, and wiser\r\nheads than hers have been puzzled to account for them.\r\n\r\nAre they sharks?  No, no.  Five times as large are they as any shark\r\never seen.  Whales?  No, again.  A whale lives not under the water but\r\non it.\r\n\r\nIn the ocean wild and wide, reader, we sailors find many a strange\r\nmystery, see many a fearsome sight at night we can neither describe nor\r\nexplain.  And if we talk of these when we come on shore, you landsmen\r\nlook incredulous.\r\n\r\nBut after a time the child became accustomed to scenes like these.\r\nIndeed the sea by night appeared to have a kind of fascination for her.\r\n\r\nIn beholding it, she appeared to be looking through it into some strange\r\nland, the abode of the fairies and elves and mermaids with which her\r\nimagination had peopled it.\r\n\r\n\"Deep, deep down among the rocks,\" she would say to Ransey, \"who lives\r\nthere?  Tell us, tell us.\"\r\n\r\nRansey had therefore to become the story-teller whether he would or not.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her then of mermaid-land deep down below the dark, heaving\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n\"Deep, deep, _deep_ down, 'Ansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very, very deep.  You see only a glimmer of light below you as you sink\r\nand sink; and this light is greenish and clear, and the farther down you\r\nget the brighter and more beautiful does it become.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're not drowned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! oh, no! not if you're good.  Well, then you come to--oh, ever so\r\nbeautiful a country!  The trees are all of sea-weed, and underneath them\r\nis the yellow, yellow sand; but here and there are beautiful rockeries,\r\nand beds of such bright and lovely flowers that they would dazzle your\r\neyes to look upon.  And the strange thing about these flowers is this,\r\nBabs, they are all alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"All alive?  My! and can they talk to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and sing too.  A sailor man who had been there told me.  And he\r\nsaid their voices were so low and sweet that you had to put your ear\r\nquite close down before you could hear and understand; for at a little\r\ndistance, he said, it was just like the tinkling of tiny silver bells.\r\nThe danger is in stopping too long, and being enchanted or slain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enchanted?  Whatever is that, 'Ansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you stay so long listening that you feel like in a dream, and\r\nbefore you know what has happened you are a flower yourself; and then,\r\nthough you can see and hear everything that goes on around you, you\r\ncannot move away from the rock you are growing on, and you never get\r\nback again out of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, never, 'Ansey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, never, Babs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the deep, dark, beautiful woods that you come to and enter there\r\nis many a terrible monster living--horned, shelly, warty monsters.  And\r\nthey are all waiting to catch you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible, 'Ansey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, 'Ansey!  Be terrible some more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is danger all around you now, for some of these monsters\r\nare quite hidden among the sand, with only one eye protruding, and this\r\nlooks like a flower because it grows on a stalk.  But when you go to\r\nlook at it, suddenly the sandy ground gives way under you.  You are\r\ncaught and killed, and know no more.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these monsters, Nelda, live in caves, and if you go too near\r\nthe entrance a great, long, skinny arm is thrust out, and you are\r\ndragged into the dark and devoured.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I would turn quickly away out of that terrible wood, 'Ansey,\" said\r\nNelda.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is just what the sailor did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then he was saved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.  He came to a lovely wide patch of clear, hard sand, and he\r\nwas looking down to admire it.  He had taken up some to examine, and was\r\npouring it from one hand into the other--for the sand was pure gold\r\nmixed with pearls and rubies--when all at once it began to get dark, and\r\nlooking up he saw a creature that was nearly all one horrible, cruel,\r\ngrinning head, with eight long arms round it.  It stopped high up, just\r\nhovering, Nelda, like a hawk over a field.  The sailor man was\r\nspell-bound.  He could only stare up at it with starting eyes and utter\r\na long, low, frightened moan.  But from the creature above a tent was\r\nlowered, just like a huge bell, and he knew it would soon fall over him\r\nand he would be sucked up to the sea-demon's body and slowly eaten\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n\"But at that very moment, sissie, the creature uttered a terribly wild\r\nand mournful cry, and darted off through the water, which was all just\r\nlike ink now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the sailor was dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; a voice that sounded like the sweetest music ever he had heard in\r\nhis life was heard, and a hand grasped his.\r\n\r\n\"`Quick, quick,' she cried, for it was a mermaid, `I will lead you into\r\nsafety.  Stay but another moment here and you are doomed.'\r\n\r\n\"`I'll follow you to the end of the world, miss,' said the gallant\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n\"It did seem queer to call a mermaid miss, but Jack Reid couldn't help\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"`You won't have to follow so far,' she said, with a sweet smile that\r\nput Jack's heart all in a flutter.\r\n\r\n\"And in five minutes' time they were out of danger, and there was Jack\r\nwith his hat in his hand, which he had taken off for politeness' sake,\r\nbeing led along by the most charming young lady he had ever clapped eyes\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"`Her beauty,' he said to me, `was radiant, and her long yellow hair\r\nfloated behind her in the water till I was ravished; on'y the wust of it\r\nwas, that all below the waist wasn't lady at all, but ling or some other\r\nkind of fish.'\r\n\r\n\"But Jack wouldn't look at the ling part at all, only just at the\r\nmermaid's face and hair and hands.\r\n\r\n\"However dark it might have been, you could have seen to read by the\r\nlight of the diamonds around her brow and neck.\r\n\r\n\"They soon came to a rock of quartz and porphyry, and next minute Jack\r\nfound himself in a hall of such dazzling delight that he had to rub his\r\neyes and pinch himself hard to make sure he was not in a dream.  This\r\nwas the mermaids' and sea-fairies' great ballroom.\r\n\r\n\"Tier upon tier of galleries rose up towards the beautiful, star-studded\r\nceiling, and every gallery was filled with beautiful ladies.  Jack knew\r\nthat they all ended in ling, but the tails could not be seen.\r\n\r\n\"There was light and loveliness everywhere, and flowers everywhere--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, 'Ansey.  Your story is better than the Revelations, better even\r\nthan `Jack the Giant Killer.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I must stop, siss, because even _I_ don't know much more, only that the\r\nmusic was so ravishing that Jack himself danced till he couldn't dance a\r\nbit more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he sit down?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he thought he would like a smoke, so he floated away down to the\r\nentrance to a cave at the far, far end.\r\n\r\n\"`That must be the smoking-room,' he thought to himself, so he pushed\r\naside the curtain and floated boldly in.\r\n\r\n\"But lo and behold, this inner cave was filled with little shrivelled-up\r\nold men, uglier far in the face than toads.\r\n\r\n\"These, sissie, were the mermen, and they were all sitting on rough\r\nblocks of coral, which must have hurt them dreadful, nursing their\r\ntails.  These mermen sat there swaying their yellow, wrinkled bodies\r\nback and fore, to and fro, but taking not the slightest notice of Jack.\r\nThe sailor stood staring at them; and well he might, for whatever motion\r\none made the others all made the same.  If one lifted a skeleton hand to\r\nrub its bald head, every hand was raised, every bald head was rubbed;\r\nwhichever way one swayed all the rest swayed; sometimes every blear eye\r\nwas directed to the ceiling, or lowered towards their tails, as the case\r\nmight be; and when one gaped and yawned they all gaped and yawned, and\r\nJack told me that he had never seen such a set of ugly, toothless mouths\r\nin his life before.\r\n\r\n\"But as _they_ wouldn't speak, Jack Reid himself--and he was a very\r\nbrave sailor, sissie--did speak.\r\n\r\n\"`Ahoy, maties!' he cried, `ye don't seem an over-lively lot here, I\r\nmust say, but has e'er a one o' ye got sich a thing as a bit o' baccy?'\r\n\r\n\"Jack told me, Babs, that when he made this speech he got a fearful\r\nfright.  Every merman stood up straight on its stool, its skinny arms\r\nand claw-like hands held straight above its head, and a yell rang\r\nthrough the hall that Jack says is ringing in his ears till this day.\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!' he cried, `if that's your little game, here's for off.'\r\n\r\n\"Jack must have been glad enough to get back to the ballroom, but this\r\nwas now deserted.  No one was there at all except the lovely mermaid who\r\nhad saved him from being devoured by the terrible devil-fish.\r\n\r\n\"She smiled upon him as sweetly as ever.\r\n\r\n\"`I'm going to guide you,' she said, `to the nursery grotto; it is time\r\nthat all sailor boys went to by-by.'\r\n\r\n\"`Go on, missie,' Jack said, `go on, yer woice is sweeter far than the\r\nsong of--of a Mother Carey's chicken.  Wot a lovely lady ye'd be, miss,\r\nif ye didn't end in ling!'\r\n\r\n\"She smiled, and combed her hair with her long white fairy fingers as\r\nshe glided on.\r\n\r\n\"`Going to by-by am I?  Well, the mum did used to call it that like,\r\nmiss, but we grown-up sailor lads calls it a bunk or an 'ammock.  Ain't\r\ngot ne'er a bit o' baccy about ye, has ye, miss?'\r\n\r\n\"But the fairy mermaid only smiled.\r\n\r\n\"So soft and downy was the bed that Jack fell asleep singing low to\r\nhimself--\r\n\r\n  \"`All in the downs the fleet was moored.'\r\n\r\n\"And that is the end of the story, siss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!  What did he see when he woke up again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when he awoke in the morning, much to his amazement, he found\r\nhimself in his own bed in his mother's little cottage at home.\r\n\r\n\"He rubbed his eyes twice before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"`What! mother?' he cried.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, it is your own old mother, dearie, and I've been sittin' up with\r\nyou, and sich nonsense you has been a-talkin', surely.'\r\n\r\n\"`I'm not a merman, or anything, am I, mother?  I don't end in ling, do\r\nI, mother?'\r\n\r\n\"`No, Jack Reid, you end in two good strong legs; but strong as they\r\nare, my boy, they weren't strong enough to keep you from tumbling down\r\nlast night.  O Jack, Jack!'\"\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL ADVENTURES OF THE DANCING CRANE.\r\n\r\nHardly had Ransey finished his story ere a bright flash of lightning lit\r\nup the ship from stem to stern--a flash that seemed to strike the top of\r\nevery rolling wave and hiss in the hollows between; a flash that left\r\nthe barque in Cimmerian though only momentary darkness, for hardly had\r\nthe thunder that followed--deep, loud, and awful--commenced, ere flash\r\nsucceeded flash, and the sea all around seemed an ocean of fire.\r\n\r\nFor a time little Nelda could not be prevailed upon to go below.  She\r\nwas indeed a child of the wilds, and a thunderstorm was one of her chief\r\ndelights.\r\n\r\nAh! but this was going to be somewhat more than a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n\"Hands, shorten sail!  All hands on deck!\"  It was Tandy's voice\r\nsounding through the speaking trumpet--ringing through it, I might say,\r\nand yet it scarce could be heard above the incessant crashing of the\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nThe men came tumbling up, looking scared and frightened in the blue\r\nglare of the lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Away aloft!  Bear a hand, my hearties!  Get her snug, and we'll splice\r\nthe main-brace.  Hurrah, lads!  Nimbly does it!\"\r\n\r\nSwaying high up on the top-gallant yards they looked no bigger than\r\nrooks, and with every uncertain lurch and roll the yard-ends seemed\r\nalmost to touch the water.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that the stewardess came staggering aft.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, 'Ansey--don't go,\" cried Nelda.\r\n\r\n\"Duty's duty, dear, and it's `all hands' now.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her safely down the companion-way, and next minute he was\r\nswarming up the ratlines to his station.  But he had to pause every few\r\nseconds and hang on to the rigging, with his back right over the water--\r\nhang on for dear life.\r\n\r\nThe sails were reefed, and some were got in, and not till the men had\r\ngot down from aloft did the rain come on.  For higher and higher had the\r\nclouds on the northern horizon banked up, till they covered all the sky.\r\n\r\nSo awful was the rain, and so blinding, that it was impossible to see\r\nten yards ahead, or even to guess from which direction the storm would\r\nactually come.\r\n\r\nThe wind was already whirling in little eddies from end to end of the\r\ndeck, but hardly yet did it affect the motion of the ship, or give her\r\nway in any one direction.\r\n\r\nThe men were ordered below in batches, to get into their oilskins, for\r\nright well Tandy knew that a fearful night had to be faced.\r\n\r\nThe men received their grog now, and well did they deserve it.\r\n\r\nAnother hand was put to the wheel (two men in all), and near them stood\r\nthe bold mate Tandy, ready to give orders by signal or even by touch,\r\nshould they fail to hear his voice.  All around the deck the men were\r\nclinging to bulwark or stay.\r\n\r\nWaiting for the inevitable!\r\n\r\nAh! now it came.  The rain had ceased for a time.  So heavy had it been\r\nthat the waves themselves were levelled, and Tandy could now see a long\r\nline of white coming steadily up astern.\r\n\r\nHe thanked the God who rules on sea as well as on dry land that the\r\nsquall was coming from that direction.  Had it taken the good ship\r\nsuddenly aback she might have gone down stern-foremost, even with the\r\nnow limited spread of canvas that was on her.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the first mountain wave that hit the good barque sent her\r\nflying through the sea as if she had been but an empty match-box.  That\r\nwave burst on board, however--pooped her, in fact--and went roaring\r\nforward, a sea of solid foaming water.\r\n\r\nThe good vessel shivered from stem to stern like a creature in the\r\nthroes of death.  For a few minutes only.  Next minute she had shaken\r\nherself free, and was dashing through the water at a pace that only a\r\nyacht could have beaten.\r\n\r\nThe thunder now went rolling down to leeward, and the rain ceased, but\r\nthe gale increased in force, and in a short time she had to be eased\r\nagain, and now she was scudding along almost under bare poles.  It would\r\nbe hours before mate Tandy could get below; but Ransey's watch was now\r\noff deck, so he went down to ask Janeira, the stewardess, if Nelda was\r\nin bed.\r\n\r\nShe was in bed most certainly, but through the half-open doorway she\r\ncould hear Ransey's voice, and shouted to him.\r\n\r\n\"I fink, sah,\" Janeira said, \"she am just one leetle bit afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about that, and the questions with which she plied\r\nher brother, when he took a seat by her bunk to comfort her, were\r\npeculiar, to say the least.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy won't be down for a long, long time?\"--that was one.\r\n\r\n\"The poor men, though, how many is drownded?\"--another.\r\n\r\n\"The ship did go to the bottom though, didn't it, 'cause I heard the\r\nwater all rush down?\"--a third.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite, quite sure father isn't drownded?  And you are sure no\r\nawful beasts have come up with long arms?  Well, tell us some stories.\"\r\n\r\n_Nolens volens_, Ransey had to.  But Babs got drowsy at last, the white\r\neyelids drooped and drooped till they finally closed; then Ransey went\r\nquietly away and turned into his hammock.\r\n\r\nYoung though he was, the heaviest sea-way could not frighten him, nor\r\nthe stormiest wind that could blow.  The sound of the wind as it went\r\nroaring through the rigging could only make him drowsy, and the ship\r\nherself would rock him to sleep.  The barque was snug, too, and it was\r\nhappiness itself to hear his father's footsteps, as he walked the\r\nquarterdeck, pausing now and then to give an order to the men at the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"Behaved like an angel all through, Halcott!\"  That was what Tandy told\r\nthe skipper next morning at breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"I knew she would, Tandy.  I'm proud of our _Sea Flower_, and, my\r\nfriend, I'm just as proud of you.  I'd have stopped on deck to lend a\r\nhand, but that wouldn't have done any good.\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" he cried.  Jane was the contraction for \"Janeira.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss, sah; I'se not fah off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no toast this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah; Lord Fitzmantle he done go hab one incident dis mawnin'.  He\r\nblingin' de toast along, w'en all same one big wave struckee he and down\r\nhe tumble, smash de plate, and lose all de toast foh true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the naughty boy!\" said Nelda, who was hurrying through her\r\nbreakfast to go on deck to \"see the sea,\" as she expressed it.\r\n\r\n\"No, leetle Meess Tandy, Lord Fitzmantle he good boy neahly all de time.\r\nIt was poorly an incident, meesie, for de big sea cut his legs clean\r\noff, and down he come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for Fitz,\" said Nelda with a sigh; \"I suppose it was\r\nonly his sea-legs though.  And I'm going to have mine to-day.  I asked\r\nthe carpenter, and he said he would make me some soon, and it wouldn't\r\nbe a bit sore putting them on.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWith varying fortunes the good ship _Sea Flower_ sailed south and away,\r\ntill at last the Cape of Good Hope was reached and rounded.\r\n\r\nHere they experienced very heavy weather indeed, with terrible storms of\r\nthunder and lightning, and bigger seas than Tandy himself had ever seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut by this time little Nelda was quite a sailor, and a greater\r\nfavourite fore and aft than ever.\r\n\r\nSea-legs had, figuratively speaking, been served out to all the green\r\nhands.  Nelda had a capital pair, and could use them well.  Fitz had to\r\nmake his old ones do another time; but Bob had received two pairs from\r\nNeptune, when he came aboard that starry still night when crossing the\r\nline.  As for the Hal, it must be confessed that there wasn't a pair in\r\nNeptune's boat long enough to fit him.  However, in ordinary weather he\r\nmanaged to run along the deck pretty easily, his jibboom, as the sailors\r\ncalled his neck, held straight out in front of him, and helping himself\r\nalong with his wings.\r\n\r\nSometimes on the quarterdeck it would suddenly occur to the 'Ral that a\r\nstep or two of a Highland schottische would help to make time pass more\r\nquickly and pleasantly.  The 'Ral wasn't a bird to spoil a good\r\nintention, so, with just one or two preliminary \"scray--scrays\" he would\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nBother the deck though, and bother the heaving sea, for do what he would\r\nthe bird could no longer dance with ease and grace; so he would soon\r\ngive it up, and go and lean his chin wearily over the lee bulwark, and\r\nthus, with his drooping wings, he did cut rather a ridiculous figure as\r\nseen from behind.  He looked for all the world like some scraggy-legged\r\nlittle old man, who had got up in the morning and put nothing on except\r\na ragged swallow-tailed coat.\r\n\r\nThe men liked the 'Ral though.  He made them laugh, and was better than\r\nan extra glass of rum to them.  So, as the bird seemed always rather\r\nwretched in dirty weather, the carpenter was solicited to make him some\r\nsort of shelter.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter consulted the sailmaker.  The carpenter and sailmaker put\r\ntheir heads together.  Something was sure to come of that.\r\n\r\n\"He's sich an awkward shape, ye see,\" said old Canvas.\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Chips; \"and he won't truss hisself, as ye might call\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if he'd on'y jest double up his legs, Chips, and close reef that\r\njibboom o' his, we might manage some'ow.\"\r\n\r\n\"A kind o' sentry-box would just be _the_ thing, old Can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! yes.  I wonder why the skipper didn't bring a grandfather's\r\nclock with 'im; that would suit the 'Ral all to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nBut a sort of sentry-box, with a tarpaulin in front of it, was finally\r\nrigged up for the 'Ral, and placed just abaft the main-mast, to which it\r\nwas lashed.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral didn't take to it quite kindly at first, but after studying it\r\nfore and aft he finally thought it would fit him nicely.\r\n\r\nIt would be protection from the sun on hot days, and when it blew a bit\r\nthe men would draw down the tarpaulin, and he would be snug enough.\r\n\r\nBut in sunny weather it must be confessed that, solemnly standing there\r\nin his sentry-box, the Admiral did look a droll sight.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral was a very early riser.  He always turned out in time to go\r\nsplashing about while the hands were washing decks, and although they\r\noften turned the hose on him he didn't mind it a bit.\r\n\r\nOne very hot day, the poor 'Ral was observed standing pensively up\r\nagainst the capstan.  His head was out of sight, thrust into one of the\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nThis was unusual, but the bird did so many droll things that, for an\r\nhour or more, nobody took much notice; but Ransey came round at last,\r\ncarrying Babs, who was riding on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo!\" cried Babs, \"here's the 'Ral with his head buried in a hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which he stowed hisself away there, missie, more'n an hour ago,\" said a\r\nseaman.  \"Afraid o' gettin' sunstroke, that's my opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Hallie,\" cried Babs, sympathisingly, \"does your headie ache?\"\r\n\r\nThe Admiral drew out his head, and looked at the child very mournfully\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\"He's got some silent sorrow hevidently, I should say,\" remarked another\r\nof the crew.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a little circle now around the capstan.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up,\" cried Ransey Tansey.  \"Come along and have a dance,\r\n'Rallie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel like dancing to-day,\" the crane replied, or appeared to\r\nreply.  \"Fact is, I don't feel like moving at all.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder, poor bird; the truth is, he was glued to the deck with melted\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nWhat a job it was getting him clear too--or \"easing him off,\" as Chips\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\nBut with the help of putty knives the 'Ral got free at last, though it\r\ntook a deal of orange-peel to clean his poor feet.  Then they were found\r\nto be so red and swollen that a hammock was slung for him forthwith\r\natween decks, and the Admiral was laid at full length in it--his head on\r\na pillow at one end, his feet away down at the other, his body covered\r\nwith the carpenter's lightest jacket.\r\n\r\nVery funny he did appear stretched like that, but he himself\r\nappreciated, not the joke, but the comfort.  He lay there for days, only\r\ngetting up a little in the cool of the evening, if there was any cool in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRansey fed him, and attended to his feet twice a day, so he was soon on\r\ndeck again, as right as a trivet.\r\n\r\nBut the Admiral had learned a lesson, and ever after this, on hot days,\r\nto have seen the bird coming along the deck, you would have sworn he was\r\nplaying at hop-Scotch, so careful was he to hop over the seams where the\r\npitch was soft, his long neck bent down, and one eye curiously examining\r\nthe planks.\r\n\r\nYes, the 'Ral was a caution, as old Canvas said.\r\n\r\nBut one of the bird's drollest adventures occurred one day when the ship\r\nwas lying becalmed in the Indian Ocean, or rather in the Mozambique\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nThe _Sea Flower_ was within a measurable distance of land; for though\r\nnone was in sight, birds of the gull species flew around the ship, tack\r\nand half-tack, or floated lazily on the smooth surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral slowly left his sentry-box, stretched his wings a bit, uttered\r\na mild scray--scray--ay or two, then did a hop-Scotch till he got\r\nabreast of the man at the wheel.  This particular sailor was somewhat of\r\na dandy, and had a morsel of red silk handkerchief peeping prettily out\r\nfrom his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral eyed it curiously for a moment, then cleverly plucked it out\r\nand jumped away with it.  He dropped it on a portion of the quarterdeck\r\nwhere the pitch was oozing, kicked it about with his feet to spread it\r\nout, as a man does with a handful of straw, and stood upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do call that cheek!  My best silk handkerchief, too,\" cried the\r\nman at the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe crane only looked at him wonderingly with one eye.\r\n\r\n\"You've no idea,\" he told this man, \"how soft and nice it feels.  I--I--\r\nyes, I verily believe I shall dance.  Craik--craik--cray--ay--y!\"\r\n\r\nAnd dance he did, Nelda and half the crew at least clapping their hands\r\nand cheering with delight.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral was just in the very midst of his merriment, when the man,\r\nafter giving the wheel an angry turn or two to port, made a dart to\r\nrecover his favourite bandana.  With such a rush did he come that the\r\n'Ral took fright, and flew to the top of the bulwark.  There was some\r\noiled canvas here, and this was so hot that the bird had to keep lifting\r\none foot and putting down the other all the time, just like a hen on a\r\nhot griddle.\r\n\r\n\"How delightfully sweet it must be up there,\" he said to himself, gazing\r\nat the gulls that were screaming with joy as they swept round and round\r\nin the blue sky.  \"I think I'll have a fly myself.  Scray--ay!\"\r\n\r\nAnd greatly to every one's astonishment away he flew high into the air.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at first, the gulls soon regained courage, and made a daring\r\nattack on the 'Ral.  But he speedily vanquished the foe, and one or two\r\nfell bleeding into the water.\r\n\r\nA gull was perched on the back fin of a shark.  The 'Ral flew down.\r\n\r\n\"It's nice and snug _you_ look,\" said the 'Ral.  \"Get off at once, the\r\nking's come.  Get off, I say, or I'll dig both your impudent eyes out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd next moment the Admiral was perched there, as coolly as if he had\r\nbeen used to riding on sharks ever since his babyhood.\r\n\r\nBut Nelda was in tears.  She would never see the 'Ral again, and the\r\nawful beast would eat him, sea-legs and all.  So a boat was called away\r\nto save him.\r\n\r\nNone too soon either.  For the 'Ral had commenced to investigate that\r\nfin with his long beak.  No respectable basking shark could be expected\r\nto stand that, so down he dived, leaving the bird screaming and swaying\r\nand scrambling on the top of the water.  \"Scray--scray--craik--craik--\r\ncray!\"\r\n\r\nBut for the timely aid of the boat, the Admiral would have met with a\r\nterrible fate, for his screaming and struggling brought around him three\r\nsharks at least, all eager to find out what a long-legged bird like this\r\ntasted like.\r\n\r\nEvery fine day the crane now indulged himself in the pleasure of flight,\r\nbut he never evinced the slightest inclination to perch again on the\r\nback of a basking shark.  It wasn't good enough, he would have told you,\r\nhad you asked him.  \"As regards the backs of basking sharks,\" he might\r\nhave said, \"I'm going to be a total abstainer.\"\r\n\r\nUp the east coast of Africa went the bonnie barque _Sea Flower_.\r\n\r\nTandy knew almost every yard of the ground he was now covering, and\r\ncould pilot the vessel into creeks and over sand-banks or bars with very\r\nlittle danger indeed.\r\n\r\nBut still the coast here is so treacherous, and the sands and bottom\r\nchange so frequently, that, night and day, men had to be in the chains\r\nheaving the lead.\r\n\r\nThe natives, also, across the line in Somaliland, are as treacherous as\r\nthe coral rocks that guard their clay-built towns, and more treacherous\r\nthan either are the semi-white, slave-dealing Arabs.\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nA BRUSH WITH THE SOMALIS--THE DERELICT.\r\n\r\nAll along the Somali coast was Tandy's \"chief market ground,\" as he\r\ncalled it.  Here he knew he could drive precisely the kind of bargains\r\nhe wished to make; and as for the Somalis, with their shields, spears,\r\nugly broad knives, and grinning sinister faces, this bold seaman did not\r\ncare anything.  Nor for the Arabs either.  He soon gave both to\r\nunderstand that he was a man of the wide, wide world, and was not afraid\r\nof any one.\r\n\r\nHe had come to trade and barter, he told the Arabs, and not to study\r\ntheir slave-hunting habits; so if they would deal, they had only to trot\r\nout their wares--_he_ was ready.  And if they didn't want to deal, there\r\nwas no harm done.  He even took Ransey with him sometimes, and once he\r\ntook Nelda as well.\r\n\r\nThe savages just here were a bad, bloodthirsty lot, and he knew it, but\r\nhe had with him five trusty men.  Not armed--that is, not visibly so.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular day there was blood in those natives' eyes.\r\nTall, lithe, and black-brown were they, their skins oiled and shining in\r\nthe sun.  But smiling.  Oh, yes, these fiends will smile while they cut\r\na white man's throat.\r\n\r\nEvery eye was fixed hungrily on the beautiful child.  What a present she\r\nwould be for a great chief who dwelt far away in the interior and high\r\namong the mountains!\r\n\r\nThe bartering went on as usual, but Tandy kept his weather eye lifting.\r\n\r\nLeopards' skins, lions' skins and heads, ostrich feathers, gum-copal,\r\nivory tusks, and gold-dust.  The boat was already well filled, Nelda was\r\non board, so was Tandy himself, and his crew, all save one man, who was\r\njust shoving her off when the rush was made.  The prow of the boat was\r\ninstantly seized, and the man thrown down.\r\n\r\nPop--pop--pop--pop--rang Tandy's revolver, and the yelling crowd grew\r\nthinner, and finally fled.\r\n\r\nA spear or two was thrown, but these went wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nHuman blood looks ghastly on white coral sands, but was Tandy to blame?\r\n\r\nNelda was safe, and in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"O daddy,\" she cried, kissing his weather-beaten face, \"are we safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, darling; but I mustn't land here again.\"\r\n\r\nSalook was the village king here, a big, burly brute of an Arab, with a\r\nwhite, gilded turban and a yellow, greasy face beneath it.  Tandy had\r\nknown some of his tricks and manners in days gone by.\r\n\r\nAt sunset that very same evening Salook was surrounded by his warriors.\r\n\r\n\"Everything yonder,\" he said in Swahili, as he pointed to the _Sea\r\nFlower_, \"is yours.  The little maiden shall be my slave.  Get ready\r\nyour boats, and sharpen your spears.  Even were the ship a British\r\nman-of-war I'd board her.\"\r\n\r\nAt sunset that evening Tandy was surrounded by _his_ men, and pistols\r\nand cutlasses were served out to all.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have trouble to-night, men,\" he said, \"as soon as the moon rises.\r\nIf there was a breath of wind off-shore I'd slip.  We can't slip--but\r\nwe'll fight.\"\r\n\r\nA cheer rose from the seamen, which Tandy quickly suppressed.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!  Let us make them believe we suspect no treachery.  But get up\r\nsteam in the donkey engine, and connect the pipes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a plan of defence that acts splendidly and effectively against\r\nall kinds and conditions of savages.\r\n\r\nBoiling water on bare skins causes squirming, so Tandy felt safe.\r\n\r\nThe ship carried but one big gun, and this was now loaded with grape.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a sound of life to be heard on board the barque, when about\r\nseven bells that night a flood of moonlight, shining softly o'er the\r\nsea, revealed the dark boats of the Somalis speeding out to the attack.\r\n\r\nBut every man on board was at his station.\r\n\r\nThis was to be a fight to the very death, and all hands knew it.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer they come--those demon boats.  The biggest boat of all\r\nis leading, and, sword in hand, Salook stands in the prow.  It is\r\ncrowded with savages, their spear-heads glittering in the moonbeams.  On\r\nthis boat the gun is trained.\r\n\r\nThe rocks re-echo the crash five seconds after, but the echo is mingled\r\nwith the yelling of the wounded and the drowning.\r\n\r\nAh! a right merry feast for the sharks, and Salook goes down with the\r\nbottomless boat.\r\n\r\nThe fight does not end with this advantage.  Those Somalis are like\r\nfiends incarnate.  Not even the rifles and revolvers can repel their\r\nattack.  See, they swarm on the bulwarks round the bows, for the ship\r\nhas swung head on to the shore with the out-flowing tide.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to them.  The water now, boys.  Warm them well!\"\r\n\r\nOh, horror!  The shrieking is too terrible to be described.\r\n\r\nIn their boats the unwounded try to reach the shore; but the rifles play\r\non these, and they are quickly abandoned, for the Somalis can swim like\r\neels.\r\n\r\n\"Now for loot, lads,\" cries Tandy.  \"They began the row.  Man and arm\r\nthe boats.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the _Sea Flower's_ men landed on the white sands, led on by Tandy\r\nand Ransey, the conquest was easy.  A few volleys secured victory, and\r\nthe savages were driven to their crags and hills.\r\n\r\n\"Let us spoil the Egyptians,\" said Tandy, \"then we shall return and\r\nsplice the main-brace.\"\r\n\r\nThe loot obtained was far more valuable than the cargoes they had\r\nobtained by barter, and I need hardly say that the main-brace _was_\r\nspliced.\r\n\r\nTowards morning the wind came puffing off the land.  It ought to have\r\ndied away at sunrise, but did not.  So the _Sea Flower_ soon made good\r\nher offing, and before long the land lay like a long blue cloud far away\r\non the weather-beam.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ship was reprovisioned at Zanzibar, and one or two sick hands were\r\nallowed to land to be attended to at the French hospital.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight she once more set sail, and in two months'\r\ntime, everything having gone well and cheerily, despite a storm or two,\r\nthe _Sea Flower_ was very far at sea indeed, steering south-west, and\r\naway towards the wild and stormy Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nOn going on deck one morning, Halcott found Tandy forward, glass in\r\nhand, steadying himself against the foremast, while he swept the sea\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Tandy.  Land, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't land, Halcott.  A precious small island it would be.  But\r\nwe're a long way to the west'ard of the Tristan da Cunha, and won't see\r\nland again till we hail the Falklands.  Have a squint, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of her, sir?\" asked Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, a ship; but she's a hulk, Tandy, a mere hulk or derelict.\"\r\n\r\n\"There might be some poor soul alive there notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you.  Suppose we overhaul her,\" said Halcott, \"and set her\r\non fire.  She's a danger to commerce, anyhow, and I'll go myself, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nSo the whaler was called away, and in a few minutes the boat was\r\nspeeding over the water towards the dismantled ship, while the _Sea\r\nFlower_, with her foreyard aback, lay floating idly on the heaving sea.\r\n\r\nIt was early summer just than, in these regions--that is, December was\r\nwell advanced, and the crew were looking forward to having a real good\r\ntime of it when Christmas came.\r\n\r\nAlas! little did they know what was before them, or how sad and terrible\r\ntheir Christmas would be.\r\n\r\n\"Pull easy for a bit, men,\" cried Halcott; \"she is a floating horror!\r\nEasy, starboard! give way, port!  We'll get the weather gauge on her,\r\nfor she doesn't smell sweet.\"\r\n\r\nNot a living creature was there to answer the hail given by Halcott.\r\nAbandoned she evidently had been by the survivors of her crew, for the\r\nstarboard boats still hung from her davits, while the ports were gone,\r\nand at this side a rope ladder depended.\r\n\r\nThe boat-hook caught on; with strange misgivings Halcott scrambled on\r\nboard followed by two men.\r\n\r\nHe staggered and almost fell against the bulwark, and no wonder, for the\r\nsight that met his eyes was indeed a fearful one.\r\n\r\nOn the lower deck was a great pile of wood, and near it stood a big can\r\nof petroleum.  It was evident that the crew had intended firing the ship\r\nbefore leaving her, but had for some reason or other abandoned the idea.\r\n\r\nHalcott, however, felt that he had a duty to perform, so he gave orders\r\nfor the paraffin to be emptied over the pile and over the deck.  As soon\r\nas this was done lighted matches were thrown down, and hardly had they\r\ntime to regain the boat and push off, ere columns of dark smoke came\r\nspewing up the hatchways, followed high into the air by tongues and\r\nstreams of fire.\r\n\r\nBefore noon the derelict sank spluttering into the summer sea, and only\r\na few blackened timbers were left to mark the spot where she had gone\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA few days after this the wind fell and fell, until it was a dead calm.\r\n\r\nOnce more the sea was like molten lead, and its surface glazed and\r\nglassy, but never a bird was to be seen, and for more than a week not a\r\ncloud was in the sky as big as a man's hand.  Nor was the motion of the\r\nship appreciable.  By day the sun shone warm enough, but at night the\r\nstars far in the southern sky shone green and yellow through a strange,\r\ndry haze.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday night Tandy as usual gave orders to splice the main-brace.\r\nHe, and Halcott also, loved the real old Saturday nights at sea, of the\r\npoet Dibdin's days.  And hitherto, in fair weather or in foul, these had\r\nbeen kept up with truly British mirth and glee.\r\n\r\nThere was no rejoicing, however, on this particular evening, for two of\r\nthe hands lay prostrate on deck.  Halcott himself ministered to them,\r\nsailor fashion.  First he got them placed in hammocks swung under a\r\nscreen-berth on deck.  This was for the sake of the fresh air, and\r\nherein he showed his wisdom.\r\n\r\nThen he took a camp-stool and sat down near them to consider their\r\nsymptoms.  But these puzzled him; for while one complained of fierce\r\nheat, with headache, and his eyes were glazed and sparkling, the other\r\nwas shivering and blue with cold.  He had no pain except cramps in his\r\nlegs and back, which caused him an agony so acute that he screamed aloud\r\nevery time they came on.\r\n\r\nHalcott went aft to study.  He studied best when walking on his\r\nquarterdeck.  Hardly knowing what he did, he picked up a bone that\r\nhonest Bob had been dining off, and threw it into the sea.  There was\r\nstill light enough to see, and the man at the wheel looked languidly\r\nastern.  When three monster sharks dived, nose on, towards the bone, he\r\nlooked up into the captain's face.\r\n\r\n\"Seen them before?\" said Halcott, who was himself superstitious.\r\n\r\n\"Bless ye, yes, sir.  It's just four days since they began to keep\r\nwatch, and there they be again.  Ah, sir! it ain't ham-bones they's\r\na-lookin' arter.  They'll soon get the kind o' meat they likes best.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, Durdley?\"\r\n\r\n\"I means the chaps you 'as in the 'ammocks.  Listen, sir.  There's no\r\ndeceivin' Jim Durdley.  We've got the plague aboard!  I've been shipmate\r\nwith she afore to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott staggered as if shot.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nNo one on board cared much for this man Durdley.  Nor is this to be\r\nwondered at.  In his own mess he was quarrelsome to a degree.  Poor\r\nlittle Fitz fled when he came near him, and many a brutal blow he\r\nreceived, which at times caused fierce fights, for every one fore and\r\naft loved the nigger boy.\r\n\r\nDurdley was almost always boding ill.  His only friends were the\r\nforeigners of the crew, men that to make a complement of five-and-twenty\r\nTandy had hired in a hurry.\r\n\r\nMostly Finns they were, and bad at that, and if there was ever any\r\ngrumbling to be done on board the _Sea Flower_ these were the fellows to\r\nbegin it.\r\n\r\nHalcott recovered himself quickly, gave just one glance at Durdley's\r\ndark, forbidding countenance--the man was really ugly enough to stop a\r\nchurch clock--and went below.\r\n\r\nHe met Tandy at the saloon door, and told him his worst fears.\r\n\r\nAlas! these fears were fated to be realised all too soon.\r\n\r\nThe men now stricken down were those who had boarded the derelict with\r\nHalcott.  One died next evening, and was lashed in his hammock and\r\ndropped over the bows a few hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, seeing his fellow taken away, the other, who was one of the\r\nbest of the crew, lost heart.\r\n\r\n\"I'm dying, sir,\" he told Halcott.  \"No use swallowing physic, the\r\nothers'll want it soon.\"\r\n\r\nBy-and-by he began to rave.  He was on board ship no longer, but walking\r\nthrough the meadows and fields far away in England with his sister by\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n\"I'll help you over the old-fashioned stile,\" Fitz, who was nursing him,\r\nheard him say--\"yes, the old-fashioned stile, Lizzie.  Oh, don't I love\r\nit!  And we'll walk up and away through the corn-field, by the little,\r\nwinding path, to the churchyard where mother sleeps.  Look, look at the\r\ncrimson poppies, dear siss.  How bonnie they are among the green.\r\nAh-h!\"\r\n\r\nThat was a scream which frightened poor Fitz.\r\n\r\n\"Go not there, sister.  See, see, the monster has killed her!  Ah, me!\"\r\n\r\nFitz rushed aft to seek for assistance, for the captain had told him to\r\ncall him if Corrie got worse.\r\n\r\nAlas! when the two returned together, Corrie's hammock was empty.\r\n\r\nNo one had heard even a plash, so gently had he lowered himself over the\r\nside, and sunk to rise no more.\r\n\r\nBook 2--CHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nMUTINY ON BOARD--FAR TO THE SOUTH'ARD.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing certain at sea except the unexpected.\"  The truth of this was\r\nsadly exemplified by the terrible calamity which had befallen the _Sea\r\nFlower_--and befallen her so suddenly, too!\r\n\r\nOnly one week ago she was sailing over a rippling sea on the wings of a\r\nfavouring breeze, every wavelet dancing joyously in the sunlight.  On\r\nboard, whether fore or aft, there was nothing but hope, happiness, and\r\ncontentment.  Till--\r\n\r\n  \"The angel of death spread his wings on the blast.\"\r\n\r\nNow all is terror and gloom--a gloom and a terror that have struck deep\r\ninto the heart of every one who knows what death and sorrow mean.\r\n\r\nA breeze has sprung up at last, and both Halcott and Tandy have\r\nreluctantly come to the conclusion that it will be better to steer for\r\ncolder weather.  So southward the _Sea Flower_ flies, under every stitch\r\nof canvas, with studding-sails low and aloft.  Shall the plague be\r\nstayed?  Heaven alone can tell!\r\n\r\nAs it is, the depression hangs like a dark, foreboding cloud over the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nNo one cares to talk much by day or by night.  The men sit silently at\r\ntheir meals, with lowered brows and frightened looks.  They eye each\r\nother askance; they know not who may be the next.  They even avoid each\r\nother as much as possible while walking the decks.  Hardly will a man\r\nvolunteer to nurse the sick.  The hammocks containing these hang on the\r\nlee side, and the crew keep far away indeed.\r\n\r\nBut they smoke from morn till night.\r\n\r\nHalcott himself and little Fitz are the only nurses, and both are worn\r\nout for want of rest.  With their own hands they sew up the hammock of\r\nthe dead, unhook it, lift the gruesome burden on to the top of the\r\nbulwark, and, while the captain with uncovered head raises his eyes to\r\nheaven and utters a prayer, the body is committed to the deep, to be\r\ntorn in pieces next minute by the tigers of the sea.\r\n\r\nPoor little Nelda!  She is as merry as ever, playing with Bob or the\r\n'Ral on the quarterdeck, and it is strange, in this ship of death, to\r\nhear her musical voice raised in song or laughter in the midst of\r\nsilence and gloom!\r\n\r\nNo wonder that, hearing this, the delirious or the dying fancy\r\nthemselves back once more in their village homes in England.\r\n\r\nNelda wonders why the captain, who used to romp and play with her, tries\r\nall he can now to avoid her; and why little Fitz, the curious,\r\nround-faced, laughing, black boy, with the two rows of alabaster teeth,\r\nnever comes aft.\r\n\r\nHalcott himself never goes below either.  He insists upon taking his\r\nmeals on deck.  Nor will he permit Tandy or Ransey to come forward.  If\r\n_he_ can, he means to confine the awful plague to the fore part of the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThey say that in a case of this kind it is always the good who go first.\r\nIn this instance the adage spoke truly.\r\n\r\nTerrible to say, in less than a fortnight no less than thirteen fell\r\nvictims to the scourge.  But still more, more awful, the crew now became\r\nmutinous.\r\n\r\nLuckily, all arms, and ammunition as well, were safely stored aft.\r\n\r\nDurdley was chief mutineer--chief scoundrel!  Out of the fourteen men\r\nleft alive, only four were true to the captain, the others were ready to\r\nfollow Durdley.\r\n\r\nThis fellow became a demon now--a demon in command of demons; for they\r\nhad found some grog which had been in charge of the second mate--who was\r\ndead--and excited themselves into fury with it.\r\n\r\nDurdley, the dark and ugly man, rushed to the screen-berth where Halcott\r\nwas trying to ease the sufferings of a poor dying man.\r\n\r\nHe was as white as a ghost; even his lips were pale.\r\n\r\nBeware of men, reader, who get white when angry.  They are dangerous!\r\n\r\n\"Here, Halcott,\" cried Durdley, \"drop your confounded mummery, and\r\nlisten to _me_.  Lay aft here, my merry men, lay aft.\"\r\n\r\nNine men, chiefly Finns and other foreigners, armed with ugly knives and\r\niron marline-spikes, quickly stationed themselves behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Halcott, your game's up.  You brought this plague into the ship\r\nyourself.  By rights you should die.  But I depose you.  I am captain\r\nnow, and my brave boys will obey me, and me alone.\r\n\r\n\"You _hear_?\" he shouted, for Halcott stood a few paces from him, calmly\r\nlooking him in the face.\r\n\r\n\"I _hear_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, cusses on you, why don't ye speak?  You'll be allowed to live, I\r\nsay, both you and Tandy, on one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is--?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you alter your course, and steer straight away to the nearest\r\nland--the Falkland Isles--at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse.  Back, you mutinous dog! back!  I say.  Would you dare to\r\nstab your captain?  Your blood be,\"--here the captain's revolver rang\r\nsharp and clear, and Durdley fell to the deck--\"on your own cowardly\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a wild yell and a rush now, and though the captain fired again\r\nand again, he was speedily overpowered.\r\n\r\nThe revolver was snatched from his hand, and he was borne down by force\r\nof numbers.\r\n\r\nBut assistance was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, give it to them!  Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Tandy himself, with the four good men and true, who had run aft\r\nbetween decks to inform the mate of the mutiny.\r\n\r\nAll were armed with rifles, but these they only clubbed.  So fiercely\r\ndid they fight, that the mutineers speedily dropped their knives and\r\niron marline-spikes, and were driven below, yelling for mercy like the\r\ncowards they were.\r\n\r\nThe captain, though bruised, was otherwise intact.  Nor was Durdley\r\ndead, though he had lost much blood from a wound--the revolver bullet\r\nhaving crashed through the arm above the elbow, and through the outside\r\nof the chest as well.  But two Finns lay stark and stiff beside the\r\nwinch.\r\n\r\nEven to tragedy there is always a ridiculous side or aspect, and on the\r\npresent occasion this was afforded by the strange behaviour of Bob and\r\nthe Admiral during the terrible _melee_.  It is not to be supposed that\r\nBob would be far away from his master when danger threatened him.\r\n\r\nSeeing Ransey Tansey, rifle in hand, follow his father to join in\r\nrepelling the mutineers, it occurred to him at once that two might be of\r\nsome assistance.  It did not take the faithful tyke a moment to make up\r\nhis mind, but he thought he might be of more use behind the mutineers\r\nthan in front of them.  So he outflanked the whole fighting party, and\r\nthe attack he made upon the rear of Durdley's following was very\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ral could not fight, it is true, but his excitement during the\r\nbattle was extreme.  Round and round the deck he ran or flew, with his\r\nhead and neck straight out in front of him, and his screams of terror\r\nand anger added considerably to the clamour and din going on forward.\r\nThe poor bird really seemed to know that men were being killed, and\r\nseeing his master engaged, he would fain have helped him had he been\r\nable.\r\n\r\nOf the ten men then who had mutinied three were wounded, including the\r\nringleader, two were dead, and the remaining five were now taken on deck\r\nand roped securely alongside the winch to await their sentence.  The\r\ndeck was quickly cleared of the dead, and all evidences of the recent\r\nstruggle were removed.\r\n\r\nDurdley resembled nothing more nearly than a captured bird of prey.  He\r\nwas stern, silent, grim, and vindictive.  Had he not been utterly\r\nprostrate and powerless, he would have sprung like a catamount at the\r\nthroats of the very men who were dressing his wounds, and these were\r\nTandy and Halcott himself.\r\n\r\nYet it was evident that he was not receiving the treatment he had\r\nexpected, nor that which he would have dealt out to Halcott had he\r\nfallen into his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you throw me overboard?\" he growled at last, with a fearful\r\noath.  \"Sharks are the best surgeons; their work is soon over.  I'd have\r\nserved you so, if my lily-livered scoundrels had only fought a trifle\r\nbetter, hang them!\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and you too, Mr Tandy, with your solemn face, if you hadn't\r\nconsented to take us straight to land!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your mind easy,\" said Halcott, quietly.  \"I'll get rid of you as\r\nsoon as possible, you may be well sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do your worst--I defy you.  But if that worst isn't death, I'll bide my\r\ntime.  I'd rather die three times over than lie here like a half-stuck\r\npig.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDuring the fight little Nelda was in terrible distress, and, but for\r\nJaneira, she would doubtless have rushed forward, as she wanted to do,\r\nin order to \"help daddy and 'Ansey.\"\r\n\r\nBob was the first to bring her tidings of the victory.\r\n\r\nHe came aft at full gallop, almost threw himself down the companion-way,\r\nand next moment was licking the child's tear-bedewed cheeks.\r\n\r\nShe could see joy in the poor dog's face.  He was full of it, and trying\r\nas much as ever dog did try to talk.  Perhaps he never fully realised\r\ntill now how awkward it is for a doggie to want a tail.  But he did what\r\nhe could, nevertheless, with the morsel of fag-end he had.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, little mistress,\" he was trying hard to say, \"don't cry.\r\nIt's all right now.  And it was such fun to see them fighting, and I\r\nfought too.  Oh, didn't I bite and tear the rascals just.\"\r\n\r\nEven the 'Ral seemed to know that the danger was past and gone for a\r\ntime, and nothing would suffice to allay his feelings save executing a\r\nkind of wild jig right on the top of the skylight--a thing he had never\r\ndone before.\r\n\r\nBut although quieted now, Nelda was not quite content, till down rushed\r\nRansey Tansey himself.  With a joyful cry she flew to his arms, and he\r\ndid all he could to reassure her; so successfully, too, that presently\r\nshe was her happy little self once more, playing with Bob on the\r\nquarterdeck, as if nothing had happened.  Blissful childhood.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs, after the ship had penetrated into the regions\r\nof ice and snow, was not an enviable one, although there was now a rent\r\nin the dark cloud that hovered over the _Sea Flower_--a lull in the\r\nterrible storm.\r\n\r\nDurdley was progressing favourably, and making so rapid a recovery that,\r\nin case he might cause more mischief, he was put in irons.  But the\r\nother wounded men, probably owing to their weak condition, had died.\r\n\r\nThe five others were allowed to go on duty.  Halcott refused to accept\r\ntheir offered promise to behave leal and true.  What is a promise, even\r\non oath, from such bloodthirsty villains as these?\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish either promise or apology,\" he told them plainly.  \"Your\r\nconduct from this date will in some measure determine what your future\r\npunishment may be.  Remember this, we do not trust you.  The four good\r\nEnglishmen, who fought for myself and mate, are all armed, and have\r\norders to shoot you down without one moment's grace if they observe a\r\nsuspicious movement on your part, or hear one single mutinous word.\r\nThere! go.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship's course was altered now, and all sail made to round Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the cold had been the means of eradicating the dreadful plague.\r\nYet Halcott was a man whom no half-measures would satisfy.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of clothing on board, so a new suit was served out to\r\nevery seaman, the old being thrown overboard.  Then the bedding and\r\nhammocks were scoured, and when dry fumigated.  Sulphur was burned\r\nbetween decks, and hatches battened down for a whole day.  Every portion\r\nof the woodwork was afterwards scrubbed, and even the masts were\r\nscraped.  This work was given to the mutineers, and a cold job it was.\r\nThe men sat each one in the bight of a rope, and were lowered up or down\r\nwhen they gave the signal.\r\n\r\nHalcott was very far indeed from being vindictive, but long experience\r\nhad taught him that mutinous intentions are seldom carried out if active\r\noccupation be found for body and mind.\r\n\r\n\"I breathe more freely now,\" said the captain, as Tandy and he walked\r\nbriskly up and down the quarterdeck.\r\n\r\n\"Heigho!\" said Tandy, \"we no doubt have sinned--we certainly have\r\nsuffered.  But,\" he added, \"I thank God, Halcott, from my inmost soul,\r\nfirst that you are spared, and secondly, that my little innocent child\r\nhere and my brave boy Ransey Tansey are still alive and happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!  And now, Tandy, we've got to pray for fine weather.  We are\r\nrather underhanded--those wretched Finns may break out again at any\r\nmoment.  They will, too, if not carefully watched.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a kinder heart than I have, Halcott, else you'd have made that\r\nscoundrel Durdley walk the plank, and hanged the rest at the yardarm,\r\none by one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The worst use you can put a man to is to hang him,\" said Halcott,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"But will you care to land on the island we are in search of, with these\r\nfellows?\" asked Tandy.  \"Mind,\" he added, before Halcott could answer,\r\n\"I take no small blame to myself for having engaged such scoundrels.\r\nWant of time was no excuse for me.  Better to have sacrificed a month\r\nthan sail as shipmates with such demons as these.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your mind easy, my dear friend; I'll get rid of them, by hook or\r\nby crook, before we reach our island.\"\r\n\r\n\"It relieves me to hear you say so, but indeed, Halcott, 'twixt hook and\r\ncrook, if I had my way, I should choose the crook.  I'd give the beggars\r\na bag of biscuit and a barrel of pork, and maroon them on the first\r\ndesert island we come in sight of.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know that Halcott paid much attention to the latter part of\r\nTandy's speech.  He was at this moment looking uneasily at a bank of\r\ndark, rock-like clouds that was rising slowly up to the north and east.\r\n\r\n\"Have you noticed the glass lately, Tandy?\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll jump down and see it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he said, on returning, \"it is going tumbling down.  I'll shorten\r\nsail at once.  We're going to have it out of that quarter.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little time to lose, for the wind was already blowing over the\r\ncold, dark sea in little uncertain puffs and squalls.  Between each\r\nthere was a lull; yet each, when it did come, lasted longer and blew\r\nstronger than those that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nThe barque was snug at last.  Very little sail indeed was left on her;\r\nonly just enough to steer by and a bit over, lest a sail or two should\r\nbe carried away.\r\n\r\nOf the four trustworthy men, one was Chips the carpenter, the other old\r\nCanvas the sailmaker.  The latter kept a watch, the former had been\r\nplaced in Tandy's.\r\n\r\nIt was hard times now with all.  Watch and watch is bad enough in\r\ntemperate zones, but here, with the temperature far below\r\nfreezing-point, and dropping lower and lower every hour, with darkness\r\nand storm coming down upon them, and the dangers of the ice to be\r\nencountered, it was doubly, trebly hard.\r\n\r\nIt takes a deal to damp the courage of a true British sailor, however,\r\nand strange as it may seem, that very courage seems to rise to the\r\noccasion, be that occasion what it may.  But now, to quote the wondrous\r\nwords of Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner--\"\r\n\r\n  ...  \"The storm-blast came, and he\r\n  Was tyrannous and strong;\r\n  He struck with his o'ertaking wings,\r\n  And chased us south along.\r\n\r\n  \"With sloping masts and dipping prow.\r\n  As who pursued with yell and blow\r\n  Still treads the shadow of his foe,\r\n  And forward bends his head.\r\n  The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\r\n  And southward ay we fled.\r\n\r\n  \"And now there came both mist and snow,\r\n  And it grew wondrous cold;\r\n  And ice, mast-high, came floating by,\r\n  As green as emerald.\r\n\r\n  \"And through the drifts the snowy clifts\r\n  Did send a dismal sheen:\r\n  * * * * *.\r\n\r\n  \"The ice was here, the ice was there,\r\n  The ice was all around:\r\n  It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,\r\n  Like noises in a swound!\"\r\n\r\nYes, the good barque _Sea Flower_ was driven far, far to the southward,\r\nfar, far from her course; but happily, before they reached the icy\r\nbarrier, the wind had gone down, so that the terrible noises in the main\r\npack which the poet so graphically describes had few terrors for them.\r\n\r\nThe wind fell, and went veering round, till it blew fair from the east.\r\nA very gentle wind, however, and hardly did the barque make five knots\r\nan hour on her backward track.\r\n\r\nOthers might be impatient, but there was no such thing as impatience\r\nabout Nelda, and little about Ransey Tansey either.  Everything they saw\r\nor passed was as fresh and new to them as if they were sailing through a\r\nsea of enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe cold affected neither.  They were dressed to withstand it.  The\r\nkeen, frosty air was bracing rather than otherwise, and warm blood\r\ncirculated more quickly through every vein as they trod the decks\r\ntogether.  How strange, how weird-like at times were the snow-clad\r\nicebergs they often saw, their sides glittering and gleaming in the\r\nsunshine with every colour of the rainbow, and how black was the sea\r\nthat lay between!\r\n\r\nThe smaller pieces through which the ship had often to steer were of\r\nevery shape and size, all white, and some of them acting as rafts for\r\nseals asleep thereon--seals that were drifting, drifting away they knew\r\nnot, cared not whither.\r\n\r\nSometimes a great sea-elephant would raise his noble head and gaze\r\ncuriously at the passing barque, then dive and be seen no more.  Shoals\r\nof whales of a small species afforded our little seafarers great delight\r\nto watch.  But these went slowly on their way, dipping and ploughing,\r\nand looking neither to the right hand nor to the left.  The porpoises\r\nwere still more interesting, for they seemed to live but to romp and\r\nplay and chase each other, sometimes jumping right out of the water, so\r\nthat it is no wonder Nelda imagined they were playing at leap-frog.\r\nNelda, when told that these were schools of porpoises, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, and school is just let out, I suppose; no wonder they are\r\nhappy.  And the big whales are their mothers!  They are not happy\r\nbecause they are all going to church, quiet and 'spectable like.\"\r\n\r\nThe myriads of birds seen everywhere it would be impossible here to\r\ndescribe.  Suffice it to say that they afforded Nelda great delight.\r\n\r\nBob was as merry as ever; but when one day the 'Ral walked solemnly aft\r\nwearing a pair of canvas stockings right up as far as his thighs, both\r\nTandy and Halcott joined with the youngsters in a roar of hearty\r\nlaughter.  There was no more dance in that droll bird, and wouldn't be\r\nfor many a long day.  \"A sail in sight, sah!  A steamer, sah!\"  It was\r\nlittle Fritz who reported it from the mast-head one morning, some time\r\nafter the _Sea Flower_ had regained her course, had doubled the Cape,\r\nand was steering north-west by west.\r\n\r\nThe stranger lay to on observing a flag of distress hoisted, and soon a\r\nboat was seen coming rapidly on towards the _Sea Flower_.\r\n\r\nThe steamer was the _Dun Avon_, homeward-bound from San Francisco, with\r\npassengers and cargo.\r\n\r\nThe captain himself boarded her with one of his men, and to him was\r\nrelated the whole sad story as we know it.  \"We have a clean bill of\r\nhealth now though,\" added Halcott; \"but we are short-handed--one man in\r\nirons, and five more that we cannot trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the steamer captain, \"I cannot relieve you of your black\r\nhats, but I'll tell you what I can do: I shall let you have four good\r\nhands if they'll volunteer, and if you'll pay them well.  And I should\r\nadvise you to set your mutineers on shore at the entrance to the Strait\r\nof Magellan, and let them take their chance.  You're not compelled to\r\nvoyage with mutineers, and risk the safety of yourselves and your ship.\r\nNow write your letters home, for my time is rather short.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe four new hands were four hearties, as hard as a mainstay, as brown\r\nas bricks, and with merry faces that did one's heart good to behold.\r\n\r\nWas it marooning, I wonder?  Well, it doesn't matter a great deal, but\r\njust ten days after this the mutineers were landed, bag and baggage, on\r\nthe north cape of Desolation Island, not far from the route through the\r\nfar-famed strait.  With them were left provisions for six weeks, guns,\r\nammunition, and tools.\r\n\r\nI never heard what became of them.  If they were picked up by some\r\npassing ship, it was more than they deserved.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" said Halcott, when the boat returned--\"at last, friend Tandy,\r\nan incubus is lifted off my mind, and now let us make--\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"All Sail for the Island of Gold.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEnd of Book Two.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\n\"A SIGHT I SHALL REMEMBER TILL MY DYING DAY.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Halcott sat on the skylight, and near him sat Tandy his mate,\r\nwhile between them--tacked down with pins to the painted canvas, so that\r\nthe wind might not catch it--lay a chart of a portion of the South\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nAt one particular spot was a blue cross.\r\n\r\n\"I marked it myself,\" said Halcott; \"and here, on this piece of\r\ncardboard, is the island, which I've shown you before--every creek and\r\nbay, every river and hill, so far as I know them, distinctly depicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"The exact longitude and latitude?\" said Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"As near as I could make them, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet we don't seem to be able to discover this island.  Strange\r\nthings happen in these seas, Halcott; islands shift and islands sink,\r\nbut one so large as this could do neither.  Come, Halcott, we'll work\r\nout the reckoning again.  It will be twelve o'clock in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything correct,\" said Halcott, when they had finished, \"as written\r\ndown by me.  Here we are on the very spot where the Island of Misfortune\r\nshould be, and--the island is gone!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle breeze blowing, and the sky was clear, save here and\r\nthere a few fleecy clouds lying low on a hazy horizon.\r\n\r\nNothing in sight! nor had there been for days and days; for the isle\r\nthey were in search of lies far out of the track of outward or\r\nhomeward-bound ships.\r\n\r\n\"Below there!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a shout from one of the new hands, who was stationed at the\r\nfore-topgallant cross-trees.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Wilson!\" cried Tandy running forward.  \"Here we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Something I can't make out on the lee bow, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, shall I come up and bring a bigger glass?\"\r\n\r\n\"One minute, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a steamer, I believe,\" he hailed now; \"but I can't just raise her\r\nhull, only just the long trail of smoke along the horizon.\"\r\n\r\nTandy was beside the man in a few minutes' time.  \"This will raise it,\"\r\nhe said, \"if I can focus aright.  Why!\" he cried next minute, \"that is\r\nno steamer, Tom Wilson, but the smoke from a volcanic mountain or hill.\"\r\n\r\nDown went Tandy quickly now.\r\n\r\n\"Had your island of gold a chimney to it?\" he said, laughing.  He could\r\nafford to laugh, for he felt convinced this was _the_ island and none\r\nother.  \"There wasn't a coal mine or a factory of any kind on it, was\r\nthere?  If not, we will soon be in sight of the land of gold.  Volcanic,\r\nHalcott--volcanic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep her away a point or two,\" he said to the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"There were hills on the Island of Misfortune, but no signs of a\r\nvolcano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not then; but in this mystery of an ocean, Halcott, we know not what a\r\nday or an hour may bring forth.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see,\" he continued, glancing at the cardboard map; \"we are on\r\nthe east side of the island, or we will be soon.  Why, we ought soon to\r\nreach your Treachery Bay.  Ominous name, though, Halcott; we must change\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer to the land sailed the _Sea Flower_.  The hills came\r\nin sight; then dark, wild cliffs o'ertopped with green, with a few\r\nwaving palm-trees and a fringe of banana here and there; and all between\r\nas blue a sea as ever sun shone on.\r\n\r\n\"It is strangely like my island,\" said Halcott; \"but that hill, far to\r\nthe west yonder, from which the smoke is rising, I cannot recognise.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may not have been there before.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Halcott.  But still he looked puzzled.\r\n\r\nThen, after bearing round to the north side of the island, past the\r\nmouth of a dark gully, and past a rocky promontory, the land all at once\r\nbegan to recede.  In other words, they had opened out the bay.\r\n\r\n\"But all the land in yonder used to be burned forest, Tandy.\"\r\n\r\nTandy quietly handed him the glass.\r\n\r\nThe forest he now looked upon was not composed of living trees, but of\r\nskeletons, their weird shapes now covered entirely by a wealth of\r\ntrailing parasites and flowery climbing plants.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied now, and I think we may drop nearer shore, and let go\r\nthe anchor.\"\r\n\r\nIn an hour's time the _Sea Flower_ lay within two hundred yards of the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThis position was by no means a safe one were a heavy storm to blow from\r\neither the north or the west.  There would be nothing for it then but to\r\nget up anchor and put out to sea, or probably lie to under the shelter\r\nof rocks and cliffs to the southward of the island.\r\n\r\nThe bay itself was a somewhat curious one.  The dark blue which was its\r\ncolour showed that it was deep, and the depth continued till within\r\nseventy yards of the shore, when it rapidly shoaled, ending in a\r\nsnow-white semicircle of coral sands.  Then at the head of the bay, only\r\non the east side, stretching seawards to that bold promontory, was a\r\nline of high, black, beetling cliffs, the home of those wheeling\r\nsea-birds.  These cliffs were of solid rock of an igneous formation\r\nchiefly, but marked here and there with veins of what appeared to be\r\nquartz.  They were, moreover, indented with many a cave: some of these,\r\nit was found out afterwards, were floored with stalagmites, while huge\r\nicicle-like stalactites depended from their roofs.\r\n\r\nRising to the height of at least eight hundred feet above these cliffs\r\nwas one solitary conical hill, green-wooded almost to its summit.\r\n\r\nThe western side of the bay, and, indeed, all this end of the island,\r\nwas low, and fringed with green to the water's edge; but southwards, if\r\none turned his eye, a range of high hills was to be seen, adding\r\nmaterially to the beauty of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe whole island--which was probably not more than sixteen miles in\r\nlength, by from eight to nine in width--was divided by the river\r\nmentioned in Captain Halcott's narrative into highlands and lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe day was far advanced when the _Sea Flower_ dropped anchor in this\r\nlovely bay, and it was determined therefore not to attempt a landing\r\nthat night.  Halcott considered it rather an ominous sign that no\r\nsavages were visible, and that not a single outrigger boat was drawn up\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches fools, and it teaches savages also.  Just a little\r\ninland from the head of the bay the cover was very dense indeed; and\r\nthough, even with the aid of their glasses, neither Halcott nor Tandy\r\ncould discover a sign of human life, still, for all they could tell to\r\nthe contrary, that green entanglement of bush might be peopled by wild\r\nmen who knew the _Sea Flower_ all too well, and would not dare to\r\nventure forth.\r\n\r\nThe wind went down with the sun, and for a time scarce a sound was to be\r\nheard.  The stars were very bright, and seemed very near, the Southern\r\nCross sparkling like a diamond pendant in the sky.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by a yellow glare shone above the shoulder of the adjacent hill,\r\nand a great round moon uprose and sailed up the firmament as clear and\r\nbright as a pearl.\r\n\r\nIt was just after this that strange noises began to be heard coming from\r\nthe woods apparently.  They were intermittent, however.  There would be\r\na chorus of plaintive cries and shrieks, dying away into a low,\r\nmurmuring moan, which caused Nelda, who was on deck, to shiver with fear\r\nand cling close to her brother's arm.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth can it be?\" said Tandy.  \"Can the place be haunted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haunted by birds of prey, doubtless.  These are not the cries that\r\nsavages utter, even during an orgie.  But, strangely enough--whatever\r\nyour experience may be, Tandy--I have seldom found birds of prey on the\r\ninhabited islands of the South Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Tandy.  \"Look yonder!\" he added, pointing to a\r\nballoon-shaped cloud of smoke that hovered over a distant hill-top, lit\r\nup every now and then by just such gleams of light as one sees at night\r\npenetrating the smoke from some village blacksmith's forge.  But yonder\r\nwas Vulcan's forge, and Jupiter was his chief employer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tandy, that is the volcano.  But I can assure you there was no\r\nsuch fire-mountain, as savages say, when I was here last.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" said the mate, \"will, I trust, make every thing more plain\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow?  Yes, I trust so, too,\" said Halcott, musingly.  \"Shall we\r\ngo below and talk a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess, my friend,\" Halcott continued, after he had lit his pipe and\r\nsmoked some time in silence--\"I confess, Tandy, that I don't quite like\r\nthe look of that hill.  Have you ever experienced the effects of a\r\nvolcanic eruption in any of these islands?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not had that pleasure, if pleasure it be,\" replied the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasure, Tandy!  I do not know of anything more hideous, more awful,\r\nin this world.\r\n\r\n\"When I say `any of these islands,' I refer to any one of the whole vast\r\ncolony of them that stud the South Pacific, and hundreds of these have\r\nnever yet been visited by white men.\r\n\r\n\"Years ago,\" he continued, \"I was first mate of the _Sky-Raker_, as\r\nbonnie a brig as you could have clapped eyes upon.  It afterwards\r\nfoundered with all hands in a gale off the coast of Australia.  When I\r\ntrod her decks, second in command, I was a bold young fellow of twenty,\r\nor thereabouts; and I may tell you at once we were engaged in the\r\nQueensland black labour trade.  And black, indeed, and bloody, too, it\r\nmight often be called.\r\n\r\n\"We used to go cruising to the nor'ard and east, visiting islands here\r\nand islands there, to engage hands for working in the far interior.  We\r\narranged to pay every man well who would volunteer to go with us, and to\r\nland them again back home on their own islands, if they _did_ wish to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"On these expeditions we invariably employed `call-crows.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What may a `call-crow' be, Halcott?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what gamblers mean on shore by a `call-bird' or\r\n`decoy-duck.'  Your `call-crow' is the same, only he is a black who has\r\nlived and laboured in Queensland, who can talk `island,' who can spin a\r\ngood yarn in an off-hand way, and tell as many lies as a\r\nrecruiting-sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"These are the lures.\r\n\r\n\"No matter how unfriendly the blackamoors among whom we may land may be,\r\nour `call-rooks' nearly always make peace.  Then bartering begins, and\r\nafter a few days we get volunteers enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they do attack you at times, these natives?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, Tandy; and I believe I was a braver man in those days than I\r\nam now, else I'd hardly have cared to make myself a target for poisoned\r\narrows, or poisoned spears, so coolly as I used to do then.\"\r\n\r\nNelda, who had come quietly down the companion-way with her brother,\r\nseated herself as closely to Captain Halcott as she could.  She dearly\r\nloved a story, especially one of thrilling adventure.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, cap'n,\" she said, eagerly.  \"Never mind me.  `Poisoned\r\nspears,'--that is the prompt-word.\"\r\n\r\n\"These black fellows were not of great height, Tandy,\" resumed Halcott.\r\n\r\n\"Savages,\" said Nelda.  \"Please say savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear, savages I suppose I must call them.  They were almost\r\nnaked, and many of the elder warriors were tattooed on cheeks, chest,\r\nand arms.  All had bushy heads of hair, and were armed with bows and\r\narrows, spears and clubs, and tomahawks.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he added, \"it was generally with the natives of those islands\r\nfrom which we had already obtained volunteers that we had the greatest\r\ntrouble.  The ship I used to sail in, Tandy, was as honest as it is\r\npossible for such a ship to be, and I never saw natives ill-treated by\r\nany of our crew, though more than once we had to fight in self-defence.\r\nThe reason was this.  Many ships that had agreed to bring the blacks\r\nback home, broke their promise, which, perhaps, they had never intended\r\nto keep.  When they returned to the islands, therefore, to obtain more\r\nrecruits, bloodshed was almost certain to ensue.  If one white man was\r\nkilled, then the revenge taken was fearful.  At a safe distance the\r\nwhites would bring their rifles and guns to bear upon the poor savages,\r\nand the slaughter would be too dreadful to contemplate.  If the unhappy\r\nwretches took shelter in their woods or jungles, these would be set on\r\nfire, till at last a hundred or more of them would fling their arms\r\naway, hold up the palms of their hands in token of submission, or as on\r\nappeal for mercy, and huddle together in a corner like fowls, and just\r\nas helpless.  The whites could then pick and choose volunteers as they\r\npleased, and it is needless to tell you there was nothing given in\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\"Our trouble took place when we returned to an island, having found it\r\nimpossible to bring the natives we had taken off back with us.  This\r\nthey looked upon as cheating, and they would rush to arms, compelling us\r\nto fire upon them in self-defence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we were constantly on the search for new islands.  The natives on\r\nthese might threaten us for a time, but the `call-crows' soon pacified\r\nthem.  The beads and presents we distributed, coupled with the glowing\r\naccounts of life in Queensland which the `crows' gave these poor\r\nheathen, did all the rest, and we soon had a cargo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this species of trade was, or is, called black-birding, I think,\"\r\nsaid Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"It was, and _is_ now, _sub rosa_.\r\n\r\n\"But I was going to tell you of a volcanic eruption.  Before I do so,\r\nhowever, I propose that we order the main-brace to be spliced.  For this\r\nis an auspicious night, you know, and I have not heard a jovial song on\r\nboard the _Sea Flower_ for many and many a day.\r\n\r\n\"Janeira!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah.  I'se not fah away, sah.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Janeira entered, smiling as usual, and as daintily dressed as a\r\nstage waiting-maid.\r\n\r\n\"Pass the word for Fitz, Janeira, like a good girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's neah too, sah.  At you' service, sah!\"\r\n\r\nFitz had been in the pantry eating plum-duff, or whatever else came\r\nhandy.  The pantry was a favourite resort with Lord Fitzmantle, and\r\nJaneira never failed to put after-dinner tit-bits away in a corner for\r\nhis especial delectation.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jane, you shall draw some rum, and, Fitz, you must take it\r\nfor'ard.  Here is the key, Jane; and, Fitz, just tell them for'ard to\r\ndrink the healths of those aft, and sing as much as they choose\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Far away then, Tandy and Nelda,\" said Halcott, resuming his narrative,\r\n\"to the west of this island, farther away almost than the imagination\r\ncan grasp, so solitary and wide is this great ocean, there used to be a\r\nsmall island called Saint Queeba.  Who first found it out, or named it,\r\nI cannot tell you, Tandy, but I believe our own brig was the first that\r\never visited it in a black-birding expedition.\r\n\r\n\"The population seemed to be about three thousand, and of these we took\r\naway at least one hundred and fifty.  The poor creatures appeared to\r\nhave no fear of white men, and so we concealed our revolvers and entered\r\ninto friendly intercourse with them.\r\n\r\n\"The island was a long way from any other, and this probably accounted\r\nfor its never having been black-birded before.\r\n\r\n\"We returned from Australia almost immediately again after landing our\r\nrecruits, and I for one felt sure the natives would welcome us.\r\n\r\n\"So we brought extra-showy cloth and the brightest beads we could\r\nprocure.\r\n\r\n\"They did welcome us, and we soon had about half a cargo of real\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\n\"We were only waiting for others to come from the interior; for the wind\r\nwas fair just then, and we were all anxious to proceed to sea.\r\n\r\n\"The very evening before the arrival of the blacks, however, the wind\r\nwent suddenly down, although, strangely enough, at a great altitude we\r\ncould see scores of small black clouds scurrying across the sky.\r\nFinally, some of these circled round and round, and combined to form a\r\ndark blue canopy that gradually lowered itself towards the island.\r\n\r\n\"Soon the sun went down, a blood-red ball in the west, and darkness\r\nquickly followed.  It was just then that we observed a fitful gleam\r\narise from the one and only mountain the island possessed.  Over this a\r\nball of cloud had hung all day long, but we had taken little notice of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"`I've never seen the like of that before, mate,' said the skipper to\r\nme, pointing at the slowly descending pall of cumulus.\r\n\r\n\"`Nor I either, captain,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't keep my eyes off it, do what I would, for dark though the\r\nnight was that strange cloud was darker.  It seemed now to be sending\r\ndownwards from its centre a whirling tail, or pillar, which the gleams\r\nthat began to rise higher and higher from the developing volcano lit up,\r\nand tongues of fire appeared to touch.\r\n\r\n\"`It's going to be a storm of some kind, Halcott,' said my skipper.\r\n`Oh, for a puff of wind, for, Heaven help us, lad! we are far too near\r\nthe shore.'\r\n\r\n\"`I have it,' he cried next minute.  `Lower the boats and heave up the\r\nanchor.'\r\n\r\n\"I never saw men work more willingly in my life before.  Even the blacks\r\nwe had on board lent a hand, and no sooner was the anchor apeak than\r\naway went the boats, and the ship moved slowly out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"We had got about three knots off-shore, when, happening to look back, I\r\nsaw a sight which I shall remember to my dying day.\r\n\r\n\"The black and awful whirling cloud had burst.  If one ton of water came\r\ndown like an avalanche, a million must have fallen, with a deafening\r\nroar like a thousand thunders.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as if heaven and earth had gone to war and the first terrific\r\nshot had been fired.\r\n\r\n\"For a time the mountain was entirely enveloped in darkness; then up\r\nthrough this blackness rose high, high into the air a huge pillar of\r\nsteam.  This continued to rise for over an hour, with incessant thunder\r\nand lightning around the base of the hill.  Rain, almost boiling hot,\r\nfell on our decks, and hissed and spluttered on the still water around\r\nthe ship, compelling us to fly below or seek the shelter of tarpaulins.\r\n\r\n\"This ceased at last, and now we could see that the volcanic fire had\r\ngained the mastery; for the flames, with huge pieces of stones and\r\nrocks, were hurled five hundred feet at least into the starry sky.\r\n\r\n\"For many hours the thunderings and the lightnings over that devoted\r\nisland and around the hill were such, Tandy, as I pray God I may never\r\nsee or hear again.  There were earthquakes, too; that was evident enough\r\nfrom the strange commotion in the water around us, and this was\r\ncommunicated to the ship.  The best sailors on our brig could scarcely\r\nstand, far less walk.  Towards morning it had partially cleared,\r\nalthough the lightning still continued to play, fork and sheet, above\r\nthe base of the volcanic hill.  We could now see streams of molten lava\r\npouring down the mountain's side, green, crimson, and violet.\r\n\r\n\"Very lovely indeed they were.  But ah! then I knew the fate of those\r\nunhappy inhabitants was to be a terrible one.  It would be a choice of\r\ndeaths, for in less than half an hour the isle was one vast\r\nconflagration.  We saw but little more of it even next day, for the lava\r\nwas now pouring into the sea and a cloud of steam enveloped the scene of\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Our decks were covered with dust and scoriae, and this fell steadily\r\nall that day.\r\n\r\n\"We had managed by means of the boats to work off and away fully fifteen\r\nmiles.  This was undoubtedly our salvation; for presently we were struck\r\nby a terrible tornado, and it required all our skill to keep out of the\r\nvortex.\r\n\r\n\"While it was still raging around us, an explosion away on our port\r\nquarter, where the island would be just then, seemed to rend the whole\r\nearth in pieces.  Many of our crew were struck deaf, and remained so for\r\ndays.  Our ship shook, Tandy, fore and aft, quivering like a dying rat.\r\nShe seemed to have no more stability in her then than an old orange box.\r\n\r\n\"An immense wave, such as I had never seen before, rose in the sea and\r\nswept on towards us.  The marvel is that it did not swamp us.\r\n\r\n\"As it was we were carried sky-high, and our masts cracked as if they\r\nwere about to go by the board.  Smaller waves followed, and the gale\r\nthat brought up the rear drove us far away from the scene of the\r\nterrible tragedy before the sun rose, redder than ever I had seen it\r\nbefore, for it was shining through the dust and debris of that broken up\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\"I left the trade soon after this, Tandy.  I was tired and sick of\r\nblack-birding.\r\n\r\n\"But in my own ship, two years after this, I visited the spot.  The\r\nisland was gone; but for more than a mile in circumference the sea was\r\nstrangely rippled, and gases were constantly escaping that we were glad\r\nenough to work to windward of.\r\n\r\n\"But listen! our good little crew is singing.  Well, there is something\r\nlike hope in that--and in the sweet notes of Tom Wilson's violin.  He's\r\na good man that, Tandy, but he has a history, else I'm a Hottentot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just one look at the sky, and then I'll turn in, my friend.  We\r\ndon't know what may be in store for us to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd away up the companion-way went Captain Halcott.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\n\"I SEE A BEACH OF CORAL SAND, DARK FIGURES MOVING TO AND FRO.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning broke bright and fair.  Not a cloud in all the heaven's\r\nblue; not a ripple on the water, just a gentle swell that broke in long\r\nlines of snow-white foam on the crescent shore--a gentle swell with\r\nsea-birds afloat on it.  Ah! what would the ocean be to a sailor were\r\nthere no birds.  The sea-gulls are the last to leave him, long after all\r\nother friends are gone, and the land, like a pale blue cloud far away on\r\nthe horizon, is fading from his view.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu! adieu! away! away?\" they shriek or sing, and as the shades of\r\nevening are merging into darkness they disappear.  But these same birds\r\nare the first to welcome the mariner back, and even should there be no\r\nland in sight, or should clouds envelop it, the sight of a single gull\r\nflying tack and half-tack around the ship sends a thrill of hope and joy\r\nto the sailor's heart.  On the deep, lone sea, too, Jack has ay a\r\nfriend, should it be but in the stormy petrel, the frigate-bird, or that\r\nmarvellous eagle of the ocean, the albatross itself.\r\n\r\nThose birds floating here around the _Sea Flower_ so quietly on the\r\nswell of the sea looked as happy as they were pure and lovely.  No\r\nwhiteness, hardly even snow itself, could rival the whiteness of their\r\nchests, while under them their pink legs and feet looked like little\r\ntwigs of coral.\r\n\r\nThe morning was warm, the sun was bright; they were moving gently with\r\nthe tide, careless, happy.  As he stood there gazing seawards and\r\nastern--for the ship had swung to the outgoing tide--Halcott could not\r\nhelp envying them.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said half aloud, \"you are at home, sweet birds; never a care to\r\nlook forward to, contentment in your breasts, beauty all around you.\"\r\n\r\nThen his thoughts went somehow wandering homewards to his beautiful\r\nhouse, his house with a tower to it, and his lovely gardens.  They would\r\nnot be neglected though.  It was autumn here.  It would be spring time\r\nin England, with its buds, its tender green leaves, its early flowers,\r\nand its music of birds.  Then he thought of his dog.  Fain would he have\r\nbrought him to sea.  The honest collie had placed his muzzle in his\r\nmaster's hand on that last sad evening of parting, and glanced with\r\nloving, pleading eyes up into his face.\r\n\r\n\"Take me,\" he seemed to say, \"and take _her_.\"\r\n\r\n_Her_ was Doris.  His--Halcott's--own Doris; the lovely girl for whom he\r\nhad risked so much, for whom he would lay down his life; the girl that\r\nwould be his own fair bride, he told himself, if ever he returned.  Ah!\r\nthose weary \"ifs!\"\r\n\r\nBut he had looked into the dog's bonnie brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Friend,\" he had said, \"you will stay with Doris.  You will never leave\r\nher side till I come back.  You will watch her for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he remembered now how Doris had at that moment thrown herself into\r\nhis arms, and strained him to her breast in a fit of convulsive weeping.\r\n\r\nAnd this had been the parting.\r\n\r\n\"What, Halcott,\" cried Tandy's cheerful voice, \"up already! and--and--\r\nwhy, Halcott, old man, there is moisture in your eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I was thinking of home, and--well, I was thinking of my dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your Doris.  Heigho!  I have no Doris, no beautiful face to welcome\r\nme home.  But look yonder,\" he added, taking Halcott's arm.\r\n\r\nLittle Nelda stood at the top of the companion-way, the sunlight playing\r\non her yellow hair, one hand held up to screen her face, delicate, pink,\r\nyet so shyly sweet, and her blue eyes brimful of happiness.\r\n\r\nJust one look she gave, then, with arms outstretched, rushed gleefully\r\ntowards her father.  Next moment she was poised upon his shoulder, and\r\nTandy had forgotten that there was any such thing as danger or sorrow in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe two men walked and talked together now for quite an hour.  Indeed,\r\nthere was very much to talk about, for although they had made the island\r\nat last, they had no idea as yet how they should set about looking for\r\nthe gold which they were certain existed there.\r\n\r\nThey had not made up their minds as to what they should do, when Janeira\r\nrang the bell for breakfast, and with Fitz was seen staggering aft with\r\nthe covered dish.\r\n\r\n\"Jane, you look happier than ever this morning.  What is the matter?\r\nHas some beautiful bird brought you a letter from home?\"\r\n\r\n\"De bootiful bird, sah, is Lawd Fitzmantle, and see, sah, dat is de\r\nletter from home.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted the dish cover as she spoke.  Beautiful broiled fish caught\r\nonly that morning over the stern, but oh, the delicious odour would have\r\nrevived the heart of a dying epicure!\r\n\r\n\"Babs is going to be very good to-day,\" said Tandy to his little\r\ndaughter after breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Better than ever, daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, much, because I'm going on shore with Captain Halcott here and two\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And _me_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not to-day, dear.  We're going to climb that high hill and look all\r\nround us, and perhaps put up a flag; and Ransey will let you look\r\nthrough a spyglass to see us, and we'll wave our hands to you.  Now will\r\nyou be better than usual?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es, I think I'll try.  And oh, I'll make the Admiral look through\r\nthe spyglass too, and when you see him looking through, you must wave\r\nyour hand and fire your gun.  Then we'll all--all be happy and nicer\r\nthan anything in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt was not without a feeling of misgiving that Halcott and Tandy left\r\nthe boat that had taken them on shore, and took their way cautiously\r\ntowards the bush.  There was hard work before them and the two sturdy\r\nfellows, Chips and Tom Wilson, whom they had brought with them--hard\r\nwork to penetrate through the jungle and to effect an ascent of the hill\r\nthey had already named the Observatory--hard work and danger combined.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the boat stood gun in hand until they saw the party safe\r\ninto the bush, then, more easy in their minds now, rowed slowly back to\r\nthe ship.  For if savages had been hiding under cover, the attack would\r\nhave been made just as the party was stepping on shore.\r\n\r\nThe exploring party kept to the extreme edge of the bush after\r\npenetrating and searching hither and thither for a time, but neither\r\ntrack nor trail of savages could they find.  But they came across\r\nseveral little pathways that led here and there through the jungle, and\r\nat first they could not make out what these were.  They learned before\r\nlong, however; for Bob, who had gone on ahead a little way, came\r\nsuddenly and excitedly rushing out from a thicket.  In his mouth he held\r\nsomething that Tandy imagined was a rat, but the shrieking and yelling\r\nbehind the dog soon undeceived him, and, lo! there now rushed into the\r\nopen a beautiful little boar and a sow.  The former flashed his tusks in\r\nthe sunlight.  He wanted the baby back.  It was his, _his_, he said, and\r\nhis wife's.  He felt full of fight, and big enough to wage war against\r\nthe whole world for that baby.\r\n\r\nTandy made Bob drop it, which he did, and it ran squealing back to its\r\nmother.  The boar, or king pig, said he accepted the apology, and would\r\nnow withdraw his forces.  And he accordingly did so by scuttling off\r\nagain into the bush.  These wild dwarf-pigs and a species of rock-rabbit\r\nwere, they found afterwards, about the only animals of any size the\r\nisland contained.\r\n\r\nAfter this trifling adventure they fought their way through a terrible\r\nentanglement of bush, till they reached the foot of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe men had brought saws and axes with them, and were thus enabled by\r\ncutting here and whacking there to make a tolerably good road.  When\r\nthey reached the hill they found themselves in a woodland of beautiful\r\ntrees.  Walking was now easy enough, and in about an hour's time they\r\nreached the summit of the hill and sat down to luncheon.\r\n\r\nEager eyes were watching their progress from the ship, for the upper\r\npart of this mount was covered only with stunted grass and beautiful\r\nheaths, among which they noticed many a charmingly-coloured lizard--\r\ngreen with crimson markings, or pale blue and orange--but they saw no\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\nTandy turned his glass now upon the barque, and there sure enough was\r\nNelda with the Admiral by her side.  He waved his coat, and twice he\r\nfired his gun.  From the hill on which they stood the view was lovely\r\nbeyond compare.  They could see well into the highland part of the\r\nisland, with its rolling woods, on which the fingers of autumn had\r\nalready traced beauty tints; its bosky glens; its rugged rocks and\r\nhills; its streaks of silvery streams; the lake lying down yonder in the\r\nhollow, with something like a floating garden in its centre; and afar\r\noff the vast expanse of ocean.\r\n\r\nLook which way they would, that sea was all before them, only dotted\r\nhere and there far to the northward with islands much smaller than the\r\none on which they stood.\r\n\r\nHigh up on the top of the volcanic hill a white cloud was resting, and\r\nits dark sides were seamed with many a waving line, the channels down\r\nwhich lava must have run during some recent eruption.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Halcott presently, \"now I can understand the mystery of the\r\nburned forest.  At first, when we landed here, we believed that the\r\nblack-birders had been ahead of us; but no, Tandy, no, it was nothing\r\nbut the lava that fired the forest.\"\r\n\r\nBut strangely enough, however, not a sign of human life was anywhere\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWas there any way of accounting for this?  \"What is your theory,\r\nHalcott?\" said Tandy.  Halcott was lying on the green turf, fanning\r\nhimself with his broad hat.\r\n\r\nBut he now lit his pipe.  Like most sailors, he was capable of calmer\r\nand more concentrated thought when smoking.\r\n\r\n\"Tandy,\" he said slowly, after a few whiffs of the too seductive\r\nweed--\"Tandy, we have luck on our side.  Those blackamoors have fled\r\nhelter-skelter at the first signs of the eruption.  Nothing in the world\r\nstrikes greater terror to the mind of the ordinary savage--and precious\r\nordinary most of them are--than a sudden convulsion of nature.\"\r\n\r\nAnother whiff or two.\r\n\r\n\"What think you, men,\" he said, looking round him, \"came up with the\r\nfire and the smoke from the throat of that volcanic hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stones and ashes,\" ventured Chips.\r\n\r\n\"Stones and ashes?  Yes, no doubt, but demons as well--so the dusky\r\nrascals who inhabited this island would believe--demons with fire-fierce\r\neyes, tusks for teeth, and blood-red lolling tongues; only the kind of\r\ndemons that at home nurses try to frighten children with, but more\r\ndreadful to those natives than either falling stones or boiling rain.\r\n\r\n\"That is it, Tandy; they have fled.  Heaven grant they may not come\r\nback.  But if they do, we must try to give them a warm reception, unless\r\nthey are extra civil.  Meanwhile, I think that old Vulcan, at his forge\r\nin yonder hill, has not let out his fires.  They are merely banked, and\r\nhe is ready to get up steam at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tandy, what see you?\"\r\n\r\nThe mate of the _Sea Flower_ was lying flat on the green hill-top, with\r\nhis telescope resting on Bob's back.\r\n\r\n\"I see--I--see,\" he said, without taking his eye from the glass, \"a\r\nlittle island far away, a level island it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a beach of coral sand, dark canoes like tree-trunks are lying\r\nhere and there, and I see dark figures moving to and fro, and many more\r\naround a fire.  The beach is banked behind by waving plantain or\r\nbanana-trees, and cocoa palms are nodding in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Halcott, \"I was right, and those savages you see, Tandy,\r\nare the natives of this Island of Gold--for we shall call it the Isle of\r\nMisfortune never again--the very natives, Tandy, who fled from this\r\nplace when Vulcan's thunders began to shake the earth.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly homewards now they took their way, and just as the sun was\r\nwestering stood once more upon the coral beach.  The boat was speedily\r\nsent for them, and they were not sorry to find themselves once more on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFine weather continued, with scarcely ever a breath of wind, for a whole\r\nweek.  But this could not always be so.  The ocean that stretches from\r\nthe shores of South America far across to New Zealand and Australia is\r\nPacific by name, but not always pacific by nature, and terrible indeed\r\nare the gales and circular storms that sometimes sweep over its surface.\r\n\r\nSo, knowing this, Halcott and Tandy determined to seek, if possible, a\r\nsafer anchorage or harbour.\r\n\r\nIt was with this view that they extended their explorations, and made\r\nlittle boat excursions round the rocky coast.  These last Nelda, much to\r\nher joy, was permitted to join.  Looking over the boat's gunwale, far\r\ndown into the depths of the clear, transparent water, she could see\r\nmarine gardens more lovely than any she had ever dreamt of.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"look, daddy, look!  That is fairyland.  Oh, I _should_\r\nlike to go down and see a mermaids' ball.\"\r\n\r\nAfter rounding the promontory, with its bold, bluff cliffs frowning\r\ndarkly over the deep, they came to the entrance to the river.\r\n\r\nThis river was fed by springs that rose far inland, and so wide was it\r\nat its mouth that the mariners hoped it would make a most excellent\r\nshelter and harbour for the _Sea Flower_.  Alas, greatly to their\r\ndisappointment, they found it barred across.\r\n\r\nAnd no other spot could be found around the island coast.\r\n\r\nBy paying out the anchors; however, which, getting a firm hold of the\r\ncoralline bottom, were almost bound to hold, Halcott believed the _Sea\r\nFlower_ could weather almost any storm.\r\n\r\nIn this he was sadly mistaken, as the sequel will show.\r\n\r\nIt was determined now to penetrate into the highland part of the isle\r\nitself, and make their first grand plunge for gold.  If this could be\r\nfound in sufficient quantities, their stay on the island need be but\r\nvery brief.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n\"WE SHALL ALWAYS BE BROTHERS NOW--ALWAYS, ALWAYS.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just there, Tandy,\" said Halcott, as the two stood together a day or\r\ntwo after on the brink of a rocky chasm, at the bottom of which the\r\nriver swept slowly along, dark and deep, because confined by the wet and\r\nperpendicular rocks--\"just there it was where my friend, my almost\r\nbrother, plunged over.  He had torn up the bridge, as I told you, to\r\nsave us from the black men's axes, and so doing sacrificed his life.\r\nAh, James! poor James!\r\n\r\n\"See,\" he added, \"the bridge has never yet been repaired.\"\r\n\r\nThen they went slowly and sadly away, for Tandy felt sorry indeed to\r\nwitness the grief of his companion.\r\n\r\n\"How he must have loved him!\" he thought.  But he remained silent.\r\nGrief is sometimes far too deep for sympathy.\r\n\r\nThey saw many little pigs to-day and rabbits also, as well as a species\r\nof pole-cat.  But having still plenty of provisions on board they did\r\nnot hamper themselves by making a bag.\r\n\r\nHigher up the stream now they went, and after a time found a place that\r\ncould be easily forded, the river meandering through a green and\r\npleasant valley, studded here and there with fragrant shrubs and\r\ncarpeted with wild flowers.\r\n\r\nMonster butterflies darted from bloom to bloom--as big as painted fans\r\nthey were, and radiantly beautiful; but still more beautiful were the\r\nmany birds seen here and there, especially the kingfishers.  So tame\r\nwere these that they scarce moved even when the travellers came within a\r\nyard of them.  Asleep you might have believed them to be till one after\r\nanother, with a half-suppressed scream of excitement, they left their\r\nperches to dive into a pool, so quickly too that they looked like tiny\r\nstrips of rainbow.\r\n\r\nDinner was partaken of by the side of the stream, and after a time they\r\ncrossed the ford.\r\n\r\nThe country was rough and rolling and well-wooded, though few of the\r\nbirds that flitted from bough to bough had any song; they made love in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the colours is doubtless granted them for sake of the\r\npreservation of species, for there are lizards large enough here to prey\r\nupon them, did the birds not resemble the flowers.  Their want of song,\r\ntoo, is a provision of nature for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThey found the country through which they passed on their way to the\r\nlake so covered with jungle, here and there, that they had to climb\r\nhills to save themselves from being lost, having brought no compass with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! yonder is the lake,\" cried Halcott; \"and now we shall see the place\r\nwhere my dear girl and her mother were imprisoned; and, Tandy,\" he\r\nadded, \"we may find gold.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nClose here, by the green banks of the little lake, and in a grove, much\r\nto their astonishment, they found a canoe.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance it had been recently used, for there were the marks of\r\nfeet on the grass, and in the canoe--a black dug-out--were a native\r\ntomahawk, a kind of spear or trident, and fishing-hooks of bone, most\r\ncuriously formed, and evidently only recently used.\r\n\r\n\"Look to your guns now, lads,\" said Halcott, \"and keep out of sight;\r\nthat island is inhabited.\"\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, as if in proof of what he said, a slight wreath of\r\nsmoke came curling up through the foliage of a large-leaved banana grove\r\non the tiny island.\r\n\r\nA council of war was immediately held.  The question to be debated was:\r\nshould two of their number enter the canoe and row boldly off to the\r\ngrass hut, the top of which could be seen peeping grey over the green of\r\nthe trees?\r\n\r\nThis had been Tom Wilson's proposition.  He and Chips, he said, would\r\nrun the risk.  There could not be many savages on the island.  With\r\nrevolvers in their hands they need not fear to advance under cover of\r\nthe rifles of Captain Halcott and Mr Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"Poisoned arrows,\" said Halcott, shaking his head, \"speed swiftly from a\r\nbush.  Spears, too, fly fast, and the touch of either means death!\r\n\r\n\"No, my good fellows, we must think of some other plan.  I cannot afford\r\nto have you slain.  If one or two savages would but appear, we could\r\nmake signs of peace, or hold them up with our rifles.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his position at this moment Halcott alone commanded a view of the\r\nislet, which was barely seventy yards away.  The three others were\r\nsitting on the edge of the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a sudden exclamation of half-frightened surprise, and when\r\nTandy looked up, behold! there stood Halcott in a position which seemed\r\nto indicate a sudden attack of catalepsy.  Halcott's shoulders were\r\nshrugged, his clenched fists held somewhat in advance, his head bent\r\nforward, eyes staring, brows lowered, and lips parted.\r\n\r\nHalcott was a brave man, and Tandy right well knew it.  The sight of a\r\nscore of spear-armed savages could not have affected him thus; he might\r\nbe face to face with a tiger or a python, yet feel no fear.\r\n\r\nThinking his friend was about to fall, Tandy sprang up and seized his\r\narm.\r\n\r\nHalcott recovered almost at once, and a smile stole over his bold,\r\nhandsome, sailor face.\r\n\r\nBut he spoke not.  He could not just then.  He only pointed over the\r\nbush towards the island, and Tandy looked in the same direction.\r\n\r\nSlowly from out the plantain thicket tottered, rather than walked, the\r\ntall figure of a white man.  His long hair flowed unkempt over his\r\nshoulders; he was clothed in rags, and leaned upon a long, strong spear.\r\n\r\nHe stood there for a moment on a patch of greensward, and, shading his\r\neyes from the sunlight, gazed across the lake, and as if listening.\r\n\r\nThen he knelt just there, with his right hand still clutching the spear,\r\nas if engaged in prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd Tandy knew then without being told that the man kneeling yonder on\r\nthe patch of greensward was the long-lost James Malone himself.  But no\r\none moved, no one spoke, until at last the Crusoe staggered to his feet.\r\nThis he did with difficulty, moving as one does who has aged before his\r\ntime with illness or sorrow, or with both combined.\r\n\r\nJames had turned to go, when, with a happy cry, Halcott sprang out from\r\nhis hiding-place, dragging with him the small canoe and her paddles.\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!  James!  James!\" he shouted, \"your prayers are heard.  I'm\r\nhere--your old shipmate, Halcott.  You are saved!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain sprang into the canoe as he spoke, and soon shoved her off.\r\n\r\nThey could see now, in a bright glint of sunshine, that James's hair was\r\nlong and had a silvery sheen.  He gazed once more across, but shook his\r\nhead.  It was evident he would not credit his senses.  Then he turned\r\nround and moved slowly and painfully back into the bush.\r\n\r\nTandy had not attempted to go with Halcott, though the canoe could\r\neasily have held two.\r\n\r\n\"That meeting,\" he said to himself, \"will be a sacred one.  I shall not\r\ndare to intrude.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite a long time after he reached the island and disappeared in\r\nthe grove before anything more was seen of Halcott.\r\n\r\nTandy had thrown himself on the beach in a careless attitude, just as he\r\nused to lounge on summer days on the poop of the _Merry Maiden_ while\r\nslowly moving along the canal, and smoking now as he used to smoke\r\nthen--smoking and thinking.\r\n\r\nBut see, Halcott is coming at last.  He is leading James by the hand and\r\nhelping him towards the boat, and in a few minutes' time both are over\r\nand standing on the bank of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Tandy, this is James.  But you know the strange story, and this is the\r\nstrangest part of all.\"\r\n\r\nTandy took the hand that was offered to him.  How cold and thin it felt!\r\n\r\n\"God sent you here,\" said James slowly, and speaking apparently with\r\nsome difficulty.  \"_His_ name be praised.  It was for this happy meeting\r\nI was kept living on and on, though I did not know it.  It has been a\r\nweary, terrible time.  It is ended now, I trust.\"  Here a happy smile\r\nspread over his sadly-worn face, and once more he extended his hand to\r\nHalcott.  \"Heaven bless you, friend--nay, _brother_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, James, and we shall always be brothers now--always, always.\"\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nPRISONER AMONG SAVAGES--SHIPWRECK.\r\n\r\nNot a word about gold was spoken that night.  To Halcott had been\r\nrestored that which is better far than much fine gold--the friendship of\r\na true and honest heart.\r\n\r\nFor many days James Malone was far too weak to talk much, and he told\r\nthem his story only by slow degrees as he reclined on the couch in the\r\n_Sea Flower's_ cabin, as often as not with little Nelda seated on a\r\ncamp-stool beside him, her little hand in his.  She had quite taken to\r\nJames, and the child's gentle voice and winning manners appeared to\r\nsoothe him.\r\n\r\nHis story was one of suffering, it is true, but of suffering nobly\r\nborne.\r\n\r\nHope had flown away at last, however.  He found himself too ill to find\r\nhis own living.  At the very time Halcott spied him, he had come forth\r\nexpecting to look his last at sun and sky, just to pray, and then creep\r\nback into the cooler gloom of his hut to die.\r\n\r\nHow he had been saved from the savages, in the first instance, is soon\r\ntold.  He had leaped, after he had seen every one safely over the\r\nbridge, into the deep pool with the intention of swimming down stream,\r\nhoping thus to avoid the natives, and, gaining the beach, make his way\r\nalong the coast or across the promontory to join his friends on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nHe had got almost a mile on, and was feeling somewhat exhausted, when\r\nthe river suddenly narrowed again, and before he could do anything to\r\nhelp himself, he was caught in the rapids and hurried along at a fearful\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nSick and giddy, at last, and stunned by repeated blows received by\r\ncontact with stones or boulders, he suddenly lost consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Darkness, dearie,\" he said, as if addressing Nelda only, \"darkness came\r\nover me all at once, and many and many a day after that I lived to\r\nwonder why it had not been the darkness of death.\r\n\r\n\"When I recovered consciousness--when I got a little better, I mean,\r\ndearie--and opened my eyes, I found myself lying in a clearing of the\r\nforest, pained, and bruised, and bleeding.\r\n\r\n\"Pained I well might be, for feet and hands were tightly bound with a\r\nspecies of willow.  But I was alone.  I thanked God for that.  I had no\r\nidea how long I had lain there, but it was night, and the stars that\r\nbrightly shone above me were, for a time, my only companions.  They gave\r\nme hope--oh, not for this world, but for the next.  I felt my time would\r\nsoon come, and that, baulked in their designs on the ladies, the savages\r\nwould torture and sacrifice me.  In spite of my sores and sufferings,\r\nsome influence seemed to steal down from those holy stars to calm me,\r\nand I fell fast asleep once more.  It could not have been for long,\r\nthough.  I had a rude awakening.  All around me, but some distance off,\r\nwas a circle of dusky warriors, spear-armed.  I could see their eyes and\r\nteeth gleaming white in the starlight, as they danced exultingly round\r\nand round me, brandishing their weapons and uttering their wild yells,\r\ntheir savage battle-cries.\r\n\r\n\"But every now and then the circle would be suddenly narrowed, as a\r\ndozen or more of the fiercest and most demon-like rushed upon me with\r\nlevelled spears, and it was then I thought my time had come.  But the\r\nbitterness of death was past, and now, as if mad myself, I defied them,\r\nlaughed at them, spat at them.  My voice sounded far-off.  I could\r\nhardly believe it was my own.\r\n\r\n\"But, as if by magic, suddenly every warrior disappeared, and into the\r\nclearing stalked a savage taller than any I had yet seen.  His spear was\r\nlike a weaver's beam, as says the Bible.  With hair adorned with\r\nfeathers, with face, chest, and arms disfigured by tattooing--the scars\r\nin many places hardly yet healed--with awful mouth, and gleaming,\r\nvindictive eyes, he looked indeed a fearsome figure.\r\n\r\n\"At each side of him marched three men carrying torches, and close\r\nbehind two savages bearing a litter, or rude hammock, of branches.  On\r\nto this I was roughly lifted, and borne away through the dark woods.\r\n\r\n\"But whither?  I hardly dared guess at the answer to that question.  To\r\ndeath, I felt certain--death by torture and the stake.  The chief would\r\nyet, he doubtless believed, have `white blood' to drink, and that blood\r\nshould be mine.\r\n\r\n\"It was to the small lake island, however, on which you found me, that I\r\nwas carried, more dead than alive, and here I was to be kept a prisoner\r\nuntil the full of another moon.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you how I gradually ingratiated myself into favour,\r\nfirst with the medicine-man, and afterwards with the king himself, whom\r\nI taught much that was of use to him in the arts of peace, till he came\r\nto consider me far more useful alive than dead.  Nor am I willing to\r\nspeak before this dear child of the awful rites, the mummeries, and\r\nfearful human sacrifices that my eyes have witnessed.  The wonder is,\r\nthat instead of living on as I did--though life has been in reality but\r\na living death--I did not become insane, and wander raving through the\r\nwoods and forests.\r\n\r\n\"But the savages have been driven from the island at last, terrorised by\r\nthe demons of the burning mountain, and I do not think that they are\r\nlikely to return during the few weeks we shall be here.\r\n\r\n\"They fled in their canoes precipitately on the first signs of eruption.\r\nThe boats were terribly overcrowded, and although they lightened them\r\nby throwing women and children overboard to the sharks, at least three\r\ngreat war-canoes were sunk before my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It was a fearful sight!  May no one here ever live to have such\r\nexperiences as I have passed through.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could bear to listen to it, Halcott told James all his own\r\nstory and that of the _Sea Flower_ since she left the shores of England.\r\n\r\n\"Like myself,\" said James, \"you have been mercifully preserved.\r\n\r\n\"As to gold,\" he continued, \"I am fully aware that the medicine-man had\r\nmany utensils of the purest beaten gold.  They were used for sacrificial\r\npurposes; and, at one time, when the king and his warriors returned from\r\nutterly wiping out the inhabitants of an island to the nor'ard of this,\r\nand brought with them a crowd of prisoners, these golden utensils were\r\nfilled over and over again with the blood of the victims, and drunk by\r\nthe excited warriors.  After this I never troubled myself about gold in\r\nany shape or form; but just before the exodus, I believe these vessels\r\nwere hurriedly buried on the little island.  If not, they have been\r\nthrown into the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it in your power to tell us, James, where these vessels of gold were\r\nmade, or where the gold was obtained?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were fashioned, dear brother, by the spear-makers, with chisels\r\nand hammers of hard wood and stone.\r\n\r\n\"Even the medicine-man himself knew nothing of the value of the metal.\r\nIt was easy to work, that was all, else iron itself would have been\r\npreferred.  You ask me whence the gold was obtained.  I can only inform\r\nyou that the secret lay and lies with the magician himself, and that the\r\nmine is a cave at the foot of the burning mountain, probably now\r\nentirely filled up with lava.  Once, and once only, was I permitted to\r\naccompany this awful wretch to the grove near which this cave is\r\nsituated.  I was not allowed to go further.  Here I waited for a whole\r\nhour, during which time I now and then heard muffled shrieks and yells\r\nof pain and agony that made me shudder.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could these have been, think you, James?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you not guess?  At least, you may, when I tell you that a poor boy\r\nwas forced to enter the cave with the medicine-man, but never again saw\r\nthe light of day.\r\n\r\n\"I had learned by this time to talk the language of these savages, and\r\nall the information I received, when I questioned the monster, was that\r\nthe demons of the fiery hill had to be propitiated.\r\n\r\n\"But he brought back with him two huge nuggets that I could see were\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\"This was the price, he told me, that he had been paid for the\r\n_kee-waaee_.  [youth].\r\n\r\n\"I never saw those nuggets again, but believe they were fashioned into\r\nspear-heads for the king.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile Halcott and James were talking quietly down below, Tandy was\r\nwalking the deck with considerable uneasiness.  There was a strange\r\nappearance far away in the north that he did not like.  No banks of\r\nclouds were rising, only just a curious black, or rather purple, haze.\r\nIt had been so very clear all round up till an hour ago, that danger\r\nwould have been the last thing Tandy would have thought about.\r\n\r\nHe looked towards the distant island through his glass at three o'clock,\r\nand it was then visible; but now, though the dog-watch had only just\r\nbegun, it was wiped out, swallowed up in the mysterious haze.\r\n\r\nBut when a bigger wave than usual rolled in, and others and others\r\nfollowed, and when the surface became wrinkled here and there with\r\ncat's-paws, he hesitated no longer.\r\n\r\n\"All hands on deck!\" he shouted, stamping loudly on the planks to arouse\r\nthose below.  \"Hands loosen sail!  Man the winch, lads!  It must be up\r\nanchors, and off!\"\r\n\r\nThere was wind enough shortly to work to windward till they were quite\r\nclear of the bay, then they kept the barque away on the starboard tack,\r\nuntil well clear of the island.\r\n\r\nThey now worked northwards as far as possible, till the wind got too\r\nstrong, when they were obliged to lie to, almost under bare poles.\r\n\r\nNeither Tandy, Halcott, nor James could remember having encountered so\r\nterrible a storm before.  No one thought of turning in that night, for,\r\nbeing so short-handed, every man was needed on deck.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout midnight this fearful gale was evidently at its worst.  The sea\r\nwas then making a clean breach over the ship from fore to aft.  The\r\ndarkness was intense; hardly any light was there at all from the sky,\r\nsave now and then a bright gleam of lightning that lit up mast, rigging,\r\nand shrouds, and the pale faces of the men as they clung in desperation\r\nto bulwark or stay.\r\n\r\nEach lightning flash was followed by a peal of thunder that sounded high\r\nabove even the incessant roaring of the wind.\r\n\r\nSurely it was every one for himself now, and God for all who put their\r\ntrust in Him.\r\n\r\nIt was probably about five bells in the middle-watch, the hatches being\r\nfirmly battened down, when Ransey Tansey crept under the tarpaulin that\r\ncovered the after companion, and lowered himself down as well as the\r\nterrible motion of the ship permitted him.  He staggered into the\r\nsaloon.\r\n\r\nA light was burning in his father's state-room, the light of a candle\r\nhung in gimbals.\r\n\r\nTowards the door he groped his way, hoping against hope that he would\r\nfind his little sister asleep and well.\r\n\r\n\"O Jane, are you here?\" he said; \"so glad.\"\r\n\r\nJaneira rose as he entered, clinging to the edge of the upper bunk in\r\nthe endeavour to steady herself.\r\n\r\n\"Iss, I'se heah, sah.  Been praying heah all de night to de good Lawd to\r\ndeliber us.  Been one big night ob feah, sah.  But de sweet child, she\r\ngo to sleep at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she cry much?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; she much too flighten'd to weep.\"\r\n\r\nRansey bent low over his sister, and felt relieved when certain that she\r\nwas breathing and alive, for she slept almost like one in a trance.\r\n\r\nRansey had long since become \"sea-fast,\" as sailors call it.  No waves,\r\nhowever rough, could affect him, no ship's motion however erratic.\r\n\r\nBut just at that moment his head suddenly swam; he felt, as he\r\nafterwards expressed it, that he was being lifted into the clouds; next\r\nmoment a crash came that extinguished the light and hurled him to the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he felt stunned and unable to move; and now, high above the\r\nshrieking of the storm-wind, came the sound of falling and breaking\r\ntimber, and Ransey knew the ship was doomed.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nFORTIFYING THE ENCAMPMENT.\r\n\r\nThe sound was that of falling masts.  A sailor of less experience than\r\nRansey could have told that.\r\n\r\nThe barque had been dashed stern-foremost upon the rocks.  She had been\r\nlifted by one of those mighty waves, or \"bores,\" that during a storm\r\nlike this sometimes rise to the height of fifty feet or more, and\r\nhurrying onwards sweep over islands, and pass, leaving in their wake\r\nonly death and destruction.\r\n\r\nAfter the masts had gone clean by the board, there were loud grating\r\nnoises for a short time, then the motion of the ship ceased--and ceased\r\nfor ever and ay.\r\n\r\nNelda's voice, calling for her father, brought the boy to himself.\r\n\r\n\"I'm here, dear,\" he sang out.  \"It is all right; I'll go and get a\r\nlight; lie still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't leave me.  Tell me, tell me,\" wept the wee lass, \"is the ship\r\nat the bottom?  And are we all drowned?\"\r\n\r\nLuckily, Janeira now managed to strike a light, and poor Nelda's mind\r\nwas calm once more.\r\n\r\nBob had slept on the sofa cushions all throughout this dreadful night;\r\nbut Ransey was now very much astonished, indeed, to see the stately 'Ral\r\nwalk solemnly in at the door, and gently lower his head and long neck\r\nover Nelda, that she might scratch his chin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you dear, droll 'Rallie,\" cried the child, smiling through her\r\ntears, \"and so you're not drowned?\"\r\n\r\nBut no one could tell where the 'Ral had spent the night.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of great terror, the Admiral was in the habit of\r\n\"trussing\" himself, as the sailors called it--that is, he close-reefed\r\nhis long neck till his head was on a level with his wings, and his long\r\nbill lying downwards along his crop.  Then he drew up his thighs, and\r\nlowered himself down over his legs.  He was a comical sight thus\r\ntrussed, and seemed sitting on his tail, and no taller than a barn-door\r\nfowl.  It was convenient for him, however, for he could thus stow\r\nhimself away into any corner, and be in nobody's way.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDaylight came at last, and it was now found that the _Sea Flower_ had\r\nbeen lifted by the mighty wave, and after being dashed into a gully in\r\nthe barrier of rocks that stretched along the eastern side of Treachery\r\nBay, had been left there high and dry.\r\n\r\nThe marvel is that, although several of the hands had been more or less\r\nshaken and bruised, no one was killed.\r\n\r\nThe position of the wrecked barque was indeed a strange one.  Luckily\r\nfor her the sea had risen when the tide was highest, so that she now lay\r\non an even keel upon the shelf of rocks, twenty feet above the bay at\r\nlow water.\r\n\r\nThe monster wave seemed to have made a clean breach of the lowland part\r\nof the island, and gone surging in through the dead forest, smashing\r\nthousands of the blackened trees to the ground, and quite denuding all\r\nthat were left of their beautiful drapery of foliage, climbing flowers,\r\nand floral parasites.\r\n\r\nAt each side of the gully the black rocks towered like walls above the\r\nhulk, but landwards, a green bank, of easy ascent, sloped up to the\r\nwell-wooded table-land above.\r\n\r\nAs speedily as possible the main part of the wreckage was cleared away.\r\nThis consisted of a terrible entanglement of ropes and rigging.  But the\r\nspars were sawn up into lengths that could be easily moved, and so, in a\r\nfew hours' time, the unfortunate _Sea Flower_ was simply a dismantled\r\nhulk.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was finally accomplished, the men were permitted to go\r\nbelow, to cook breakfast, and sleep if they had a mind to.\r\n\r\nBut not till prayers were said, and thanks, fervent and heartfelt,\r\noffered up to the God who, although He had seen fit to wreck the ship,\r\nhad so mercifully spared the lives of all.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nStrange, indeed, was now the position of these shipwrecked mariners, and\r\nit was difficult for Halcott, Tandy, and James Malone to review it with\r\neven forced calmness.\r\n\r\nThe three men walked up together to the table-land to hold a council,\r\ntaking no one with them.\r\n\r\nThe storm had gone down almost as quickly as it had arisen, and sea and\r\nsky were blue and beautiful once again.\r\n\r\nSaid James, as they all sat smoking there,--\r\n\r\n\"Brother Halcott, my first words are these--and I'm an older man than\r\neither of you--We must not despair!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not despair!\" repeated both his shipmates.\r\n\r\nBut they did not smile, and their voices sounded almost hollow, or as if\r\nthey came up out of a phonograph.\r\n\r\nJames laid his hand on his friend's knee.\r\n\r\n\"Our prospects are bad, I allow,\" he said, \"the future looks dark and\r\ndrear.  We are far, far beyond the ordinary track of ships; ships\r\nseldom, if ever, come this way, unless driven out of their course by\r\nstress of weather.  I think, then, brother, that we may dismiss from our\r\nminds, as useless, all hope from that direction.  But dangers loom ahead\r\nthat we must not, dare not, try to minimise.  We are here with but\r\nlimited supplies of food and ammunition, and these can hardly last for\r\never.  The nearest land is hundreds and hundreds of miles away, the\r\nwild, inhospitable shores of Northern Patagonia.  We are but eleven all\r\ntold, excluding the boys Ransey and Fitz, the dear child, and Janeira--\r\neleven working hands.  Could we expect or dare, as a last resource, to\r\nreach the far-off land in two open boats?  Did we attempt this, we\r\nshould have to reckon, at the outset, upon opposition from the wild\r\nnatives of that north island; then on the dangers of the elements during\r\nthis long, forlorn cruise.  Worst of all, if not an-hungered, we might\r\nperish from thirst.  Tandy, you would go mad were you to see the\r\nanxious, fevered face and dry, parched lips of your child upturned to\r\nthe sky, weak and weary, and praying for the drop of water you could not\r\nfind to give her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, James, hush!\" cried Tandy; \"sooner far we should all die where we\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mention these matters to worry you, men, but that, knowing our\r\ndangers, we may be prepared to face them.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he continued, \"there is the king of this island and his warriors\r\nto be thought about.  Fools, indeed, were we did we not reckon on these,\r\nfor they constitute the danger that presses most, now that we are\r\nwrecked--the danger, probably, first to be faced.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, they will return?\"\r\n\r\nJames Malone pointed to the far-off volcanic hill, which was once more\r\nbelching forth smoke.\r\n\r\n\"They will return,\" he said, \"when yonder cloud rests no longer on the\r\nmountain top.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, brother, it might be possible to make friends of them.  But I\r\ndoubt it.  Treachery is written on every lineament of their black and\r\nfearsome faces.  I should never, never trust them.\r\n\r\n\"And now, men,\" he continued, after a thoughtful pause, \"I have painted\r\nour situation in its darkest colours.  Let us see, then, where the light\r\ncomes in.  The light and the hope.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took from his bosom a little Bible and those big horn\r\n\"specs\" that Halcott mentioned in his story.  These last he mounted on\r\nhis nose, and turning over the leaves read solemnly as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"`God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\r\n\r\n\"`Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though\r\nthe mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"`The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered his voice, the\r\nearth melted.\r\n\r\n\"`The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.  Amen!'\r\n\r\n\"In these words,\" said James closing the book, \"and in many such\r\npromises, do I place my hope and confidence.  God heard _my_ prayers\r\nbefore, gentlemen.  He will hear _ours_ now.  I think our deliverance\r\nwill come about in some strange way.  Just let us trust.\"\r\n\r\nBut James Malone's religion was of a very practical kind.  \"Trust in\r\nGod, and keep your powder dry,\" are words that have been attributed to\r\nCromwell.  They are to the point.\r\n\r\n\"_Fortuna favet fortibus_,\" (fortune favours the brave), you know,\r\nreader; and it is wrong to expect God to help us to do that which He has\r\ngiven us the power to do for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" said James, rising to his feet, \"let us work.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to be considered, then,\" said Halcott, \"is, I think you\r\nwill agree with me, James, our defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" said James quietly.  \"The savages will come sooner or\r\nlater, I fear, and it is but little likely they will come prepared to\r\nshake us by the hand and make friends with us.  Even if they did, I\r\nshould be prepared to fight them, for you never know what might happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, James, right.  We may be thankful anyhow that as yet we are all\r\nspared and well.  Now, you just have the hands lay aft, and tell them,\r\nbrother, in your convincing way, how matters stand.  Speak to them as\r\nyou spoke to us.\"\r\n\r\nJames answered never a word, but went straight down the green declivity\r\nand boarded the vessel.  He did not ask the men to come to the\r\nquarterdeck--James was non-demonstrative in all his methods.  He would\r\nhave no \"laying aft\" business.  This was too much man-of-war fashion for\r\nhim, so he simply went forward to the forecastle and beckoned the few\r\nhands around him.\r\n\r\nA minute or two after this Halcott and Tandy, still lying at ease on the\r\nbrow of the embankment, heard a lusty cheer.  From their position they\r\ncould command a view of the deck, and now, on looking down, behold! the\r\nbrave little crew were taking off their jackets and tightening their\r\nwaist-belts, and a mere tyro could have told that that meant business.\r\n\r\nHalcott got up now; he plucked a pinch of moss, and after plugging his\r\npipe therewith he placed it carefully away in his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\nThat meant business also.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Tandy,\" he said, and both descended.\r\n\r\nThe position, it must be admitted, was one which it would be rather\r\ndifficult for so small a garrison to defend successfully.\r\n\r\nThe vessel, as I have already said, had been dashed stern on to the\r\nrocks and into the gully, and the jibboom hung over a black, slippery\r\nprecipice that descended sheer down into the sea.  This cliff, however,\r\nwas not so slippery but that it might afford foothold for naked savages.\r\nIt must be included, therefore, in the plan of defence.\r\n\r\nBut from the cliffs that rose on each side of the ship an enemy could\r\nattack her, and the deck below would then be quite at the mercy of their\r\npoisoned spears and their clouds of arrows, while the bank astern which\r\nsloped upwards to the table-land could easily be rushed by a determined\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nAn outer line of defence was therefore imperative; in fact this would be\r\nof as much service to these Crusoes as the Channel Fleet is to the\r\nBritish Islands.\r\n\r\nThis part of the work was therefore the first to be commenced, and\r\nmerrily indeed the men set to work.  They began by clearing away the\r\nbush all round the gully where the _Sea Flower_ lay, to the extent of\r\nforty yards, being determined to leave not a single shrub behind which a\r\nsavage might conceal himself.  Everything cut down was hauled to the top\r\nof the cliff and trundled into the sea.  To have lit a fire and burned\r\nit would have invited the attention of the natives on that far-off\r\nisland, and a visit of curiosity on their part would have ended\r\ndisastrously for the shipwrecked party.\r\n\r\nIt took days to clear the bush away, and not only the men but the\r\nofficers as well bore a hand and slaved away right cheerfully.\r\n\r\nNo one was left on board except Ransey Tansey himself, the nigger boy,\r\nand Janeira.  Nelda insisted on going on shore with the working party,\r\nthe marvellous crane flew down from the hulk, and Bob was always lowered\r\ngently over the side.  These three were the superintendents, as Halcott\r\ncalled them; they had nothing to do but play about, it is true, but\r\ntheir very happiness inspired the men and made the work more easy.  The\r\nother three--those left on board--had work to do, for on them devolved\r\nthe duty of preparing the meals for all hands; and in this duty they\r\nnever failed.\r\n\r\nWell, the jungle was cleared at last, and this clearance, it was\r\ndetermined, should be extended and made double the width at least.\r\n\r\nAnd now began the hard labour and toil of erecting the stockade, and in\r\nthis strength was of very great importance.  But it was not everything.\r\nThe wooden wall must be built on scientific principles, so that a volley\r\ncould be fired on an enemy attacking from any direction.\r\n\r\nThe building of this fortification, with its strong-barred gate, took\r\nour Crusoes quite a month.  No one can marvel at this, if they bear in\r\nmind that the trees had to be cut down in the woods, and dragged all the\r\nway to the cliff before they could be fashioned and put into place; that\r\nthe rain sometimes put a stop to work entirely, so heavy and incessant\r\nwas it; and, moreover, that the men suffered a good deal from the bites\r\nof poisonous and loathsome insects, such as centipedes and scorpions.\r\nThe wounds made by either of these had to be cauterised at once, else\r\nserious results would have followed.\r\n\r\nAt last the palisade and gate were finished, loopholed, and plentifully\r\nstudded with sharp nails and spikes outside.\r\n\r\nAfter this the little garrison breathed more freely.  There was much to\r\nbe done yet, however, before they could sleep in security.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nAN AWFUL SECRET OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nHaving finished the first line of defence, attention was turned to the\r\ninner works.\r\n\r\nHow best could the Crusoes repel boarders if the palisade were carried,\r\nand a rush made down the embankment with the view of attacking the ship?\r\n\r\nIt was some time before this question could be answered with any degree\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI think that the plan finally adopted was the best under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nDuring such an attack, not only would the defenders have to do all they\r\ncould to stop a rush down the sloping bank, but protect themselves also\r\nfrom the spears that would be hurled at them from the cliffs above.\r\n\r\nAn inner palisade was therefore erected, not so strong as the other; and\r\nright over the after part of the quarterdeck, and round a portion of its\r\nbulwarks, a shed was erected, under which the men could work their\r\nrifles and the great gun with comparative safety.\r\n\r\nIf the outer line should be broken through, the savages would no doubt\r\nattack in their fullest force, and a gun loaded with grape-shot would\r\nplay awful havoc in their ranks; and boiling water from the donkey\r\nengine would in all probability suggest to the enemy the advisability of\r\na quick retreat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the outlook, even should they be thus repelled, would be a\r\nblack one, and a state of siege could only have one sad ending.\r\n\r\nBut let me not be \"too previous,\" as humourists say.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo quickly does time slip away when a person is busy that when, one\r\nmorning at breakfast, James Malone said quietly, \"Men, we have been here\r\nfor just two months to-day,\" Halcott could scarcely credit it.\r\n\r\nBut a reference to the log, which was still most carefully kept,\r\nrevealed the truth of what James had said.\r\n\r\nTwo months!  Yes; and as yet the weather and the work had prevented them\r\nfrom penetrating inland in search of nature's hidden treasures.\r\n\r\nBut the rain ceased at last; and though clouds still hung around, and\r\nmists often obscured the sea for days at a time, the glorious spring\r\ntime had come again, and the island was soon a veritable land of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe first visit inland was made to the Lake of the Lonely Isle, as it\r\nwas called.  But a bridge had to be built over the chasm, to replace\r\nthat torn up by the hands of brave James Malone.  This was easily formed\r\nof trees, with a rail at each side, and this bridge shortened the\r\ndistance to the little lake by several miles.\r\n\r\nThe working party carried picks and spades and axes, for it was\r\ndetermined to thoroughly overhaul the island in search of the utensils\r\nused by the priests during their awful human sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe isle was a very small one, but, nevertheless, it took three whole\r\ndays to thoroughly search it.  And every evening they returned to the\r\nship unsuccessful, but certainly not disheartened.\r\n\r\nHalcott told his brave fellows that if more gold were found than simply\r\nenough to pay the expenses of the voyage, not including the loss of the\r\nship, for that was insured, they would have a good percentage thereof,\r\nand something handsome to take home to wives and sweethearts.  So,\r\nalthough they knew in their hearts that they might never live to get\r\nhome, they worked as willingly and as merrily as British sailors ever\r\ndid \"for England, home, and beauty,\" as the dear old song has it.\r\n\r\nI may as well mention here, and be done with it, that Lord Fitzmantle,\r\nthe nigger boy, very much to his delight, was appointed\r\nsignalman-in-chief to the forces.  Observatory Hill was not a difficult\r\nclimb for Fitz, and here a flag-staff had been erected.  An ensign\r\nhoisted on this point could be seen not only over all the island but\r\nover a considerable portion of the sea as well.  But Fitz received\r\nstrict orders not to hoist it unless he saw a passing ship.\r\n\r\nBob was allowed to accompany the boy every day.  Dinner was therefore\r\ncarried for two, and Fitz, who could read well, never went without a\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nOne day, while James and Halcott were wandering, somewhat aimlessly it\r\nmust be confessed, in a wood not far from the lake, they came upon a\r\nclearing, in the midst of which stood a solitary, strange, weird-looking\r\ndead tree.  It was a tree of considerable dimensions, and one side of it\r\nwas much charred by fire.\r\n\r\n\"It was just here,\" said James quietly, pointing to the spot, \"where I\r\nshould have been burned, had not Providence mercifully intervened to\r\nsave my somewhat worthless life.\"\r\n\r\nBoth walked slowly toward that tree, and acting like a man in deep\r\nthought, Halcott carelessly kicked it.\r\n\r\nIt may sound like a sentence read out of a fairy book when I say that a\r\nlittle door in that part of the tree suddenly flew open inwards; but it\r\nis nevertheless true.\r\n\r\n\"The treasure must be hidden here!\" said Halcott.  He was just about to\r\nplunge his hand into the hole when James restrained him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, for Heaven's sake, stay!\" he cried excitedly.  \"The treasure,\r\nbrother, may be there.  I never thought of this before; but,\" he added,\r\n\"if the treasure is there, something else is there also, and we have\r\nthat to deal with first.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he took from his pocket a small piece of flint and some\r\ntouch-paper.  Then he gathered a handful of withered grass, struck fire\r\nwith the back of his knife against the flint--James was very\r\nold-fashioned--placed the smoking paper in the grass, shook it, and soon\r\nhad it in fire.\r\n\r\nThen he thrust this into the hole, and ran quickly back a few yards.\r\n\r\n\"Keep well away,\" he cried to his companion.\r\n\r\nNext minute the head and neck of a huge crimson snake was protruded--\r\nhissing.\r\n\r\nJames fired at once.\r\n\r\nIt was an ugly sight to see that headless serpent wriggling and leaping\r\non the clearing.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said James, as he seized it by the tail and flung it far into\r\nthe bush, \"was the chief medicine-man's familiar.  There are no snakes\r\non the island, so where he procured it was always a mystery to me.  But\r\nits possession gave the man great power over even the king himself, all\r\nbelieving it to be an evil spirit.  And no wonder, for this `red devil,'\r\nas the natives called it, although the medicine-man could handle it\r\nsafely enough, was often permitted to bite a boy or a girl in the king's\r\npresence, and the child invariably died in convulsions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" said Halcott.  \"Was there only one?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was only one, and--it will never bite again.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked back now towards the lake, and soon returned in company with\r\nChips and Wilson armed with axes.\r\n\r\nIt was hard work, and an hour of it, too, cutting through that tree; but\r\nit fell with a crash at last--\"carried away close by the board,\" as\r\nHalcott phrased it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, men,\" said James, \"search among the debris in the hollow stump and\r\nsee what you can find.\"\r\n\r\nJames and Halcott stood quietly by leaning on their rifles.\r\n\r\nBut they laughed with very joy as the men pulled out bowl after bowl of\r\nbeaten gold, to the number of seven in all.  These were far from\r\nartistic, but they were large and heavy.\r\n\r\nInside they were black with blood.\r\n\r\nChips stood up and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n\"My eye and Betty Martin!  Captain Halcott, here's a go.  Why, we'll be\r\nall as rich as water-cresses.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he joyfully tossed his hat in the air, and kicked it up again as it\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nChips was a queer chap.\r\n\r\nBut having now relieved his feelings, the search was proceeded with.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was all over, and nothing further to be found, the inventory\r\nof the treasure now exposed to view, every article of purest gold, was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nA.  Seven bowls, weighing about twelve pounds each.\r\n\r\nB.  Thirty-five spear-heads, solid and very heavy.\r\n\r\nC.  Fifteen gold daggers, similar to that brought away from the island\r\nby Doris herself.\r\n\r\nD.  Fifteen larger and curiously shaped knives.\r\n\r\nE.  One hundred or more fish-hooks.\r\n\r\nF.  Nineteen nuggets of gold of various sizes--one immense nugget\r\nweighed 149 pounds!\r\n\r\n[The largest nugget ever found weighed over 180 pounds.  It was dug up,\r\nI believe, at Ballarat.--G.S.]\r\n\r\nNo wonder these two men were excited.\r\n\r\n\"I say, sir,\" said Chips, \"I guess you'll splice the main-brace\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"That we will with pleasure,\" replied Halcott.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" cried Tom Wilson, \"I'll fiddle as I've never fiddled before.\r\nI'll make all hands laugh one minute, and I'll have them all crying the\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Wilson!  It was noted that this man never touched rum himself, but\r\ninvariably gave his share to another.\r\n\r\nThe main-brace _was_ spliced that night, and that, too, twice over.  It\r\nhappened to be Saturday night.\r\n\r\nIt could not be called Saturday-night-at-sea, but it was Saturday night\r\non board a ship; and despite the fact that the vessel was but a wreck\r\nand a hulk, it was spent in the good old fashion.\r\n\r\nAn awning was always kept spread over the fore part of the ship, and it\r\nwas under this that the crew smoked and yarned in the evenings.\r\n\r\nTo-night the officers had gone forward to hear Tom Wilson play.\r\n\r\nHe did make them laugh.  I do not know that his pathetic pieces caused\r\nmany tears to flow, beautifully executed though they were, but late in\r\nthe evening--and ten o'clock was considered late on board the hulk--when\r\nHalcott asked for a favourite air of his, Tom hesitated for a moment,\r\nthen took up the violin.\r\n\r\nThere was a beauty of expression and sadness about Tom's interpretation\r\nof this beautiful melody that held everybody spell-bound; but when at\r\nlast the poor fellow laid his instrument on the table, and with bent\r\nhead burst into tears, the astonishment of every one there was great\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nJack, however, is ever in sympathy with sorrow, and Chips, rough old\r\nChips, got up and went round behind Tom Wilson.\r\n\r\n\"Come, matie,\" he said, patting him gently on the shoulder.  \"What is\r\nit, old heart?  Music been too much for you?  Eh?  Come, come, don't\r\ngive way.\"\r\n\r\nTom Wilson threw back his head and lifted his face now.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Chips; thank you, lad, and bless you.  Nay, nay, I will not\r\ntell you to-night the reason of my stupid tears.  I'm not the man to\r\nsadden a Saturday night.  Come, lads, clear the decks.  I'll play you\r\nthe grandest hornpipe you ever listened to.\"\r\n\r\nAnd play he did.  Every note, every tone was thrilling.  A dance was\r\nsoon got up, and never before, not even in a man-of-war, did men foot\r\nthe deck more merrily than those shipwrecked Crusoes did now.\r\n\r\nBut the queerest group there was just amidships, where Janeira herself\r\nand Fitz--all white eyes and flashing teeth--were madly tripping it on\r\nthe light fantastic toe; while little Nelda and that droll old crane\r\ndanced a fandango, that caused all hands, including even Tom himself, to\r\nshout with laughter when they beheld it.\r\n\r\nThe very solemnity of the crane as he curved his neck, hopped, and\r\npirouetted, was the funniest part of the performance.\r\n\r\nBut next day all hands knew Tom's pathetic story.\r\n\r\n\"That air I played,\" he told them, \"was my little daughter Fanny's\r\nfavourite.  Fanny is dead.  Georgie too.  He was my boy.  I was rich\r\nonce, but drink ruined me, and--oh, may God forgive me!--led indirectly\r\nto the graveyard gate, where wife and children all lie buried!\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTwo long months more had gone by, during which the exploring party had\r\nbeen busy enough almost every day at the distant hill, prospecting,\r\nexcavating here and there, and searching in every likely nook for the\r\ncave of gold.\r\n\r\nBut all in vain.\r\n\r\nDuring all the time they had now been on the island--more than six\r\nmonths--never a ship had been seen, nor had any boat or canoe ventured\r\nnear the place.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, surely,\" they thought, \"some day some ship will find us out and\r\nrescue us.\"\r\n\r\nOne day as they were returning earlier in the afternoon than usual, for\r\nit was very hot, and they were all somewhat weary and disheartened, they\r\nwent suddenly almost delirious with joy to see, on looking towards the\r\nhill-top, that the ensign was hoisted upside down on the pole, and\r\nlittle Fitz dancing wildly round it, and pointing seaward.\r\n\r\nTired though they all were, there was no talk now of returning to the\r\nwreck.  But straight to the hill they went instead.\r\n\r\nTo their infinite joy, when they reached the top at last, they could see\r\na brig, with all available sail set, standing in for the island.\r\n\r\nI say all available sail, for her fore-topmast was gone, she was cruelly\r\npunished about the bulwarks, and had evidently been blown out of her\r\ncourse during the gale that had raged with considerable violence a few\r\ndays before.\r\n\r\nEvery heart beat high now with hope and joy, and as the vessel drew\r\nnearer and nearer, they shook hands with each other, and with tears in\r\ntheir eyes some even talked of their far-off cottage homes in England.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer!\r\n\r\nA flag was flying at her stern, but to what country she belonged could\r\nnot yet be made out.  But they could now, by aid of the glass, see the\r\nhands moving about the deck, and some leaning over the bows pointing\r\ntowards the island.\r\n\r\nBut, \"Oh, cruel! cruel!\" cried the poor men, and grief took the place of\r\njoy, when the vessel altered its course and went slowly away on the\r\nother tack.\r\n\r\nSo great was the revulsion of feeling now that some of the Crusoes threw\r\nthemselves on the ground in an agony of grief and disappointment.\r\n\r\nThey watched the ship sail away and away, hoping against hope that she\r\nmight even yet return.\r\n\r\nThey watched until the stars shone out and darkness brooded over the\r\ndeep, and then a strange thing happened: a great gleam of light was seen\r\non the distant horizon, and above it clouds of rolling smoke through\r\nwhich tongues and jets of flame were flashing.\r\n\r\nThe brig was on fire and burning fiercely!\r\n\r\nHer very masts and rigging were seen for a time, darkling through the\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\nNo one thought of leaving the hill now; they would see the last of that\r\nmysterious ship.\r\n\r\nYes, and the last came within an hour.\r\n\r\nAn immense fountain of fire rose high into the air, lighting the sea up\r\nin one broad crimson bar from horizon to shore--then darkness.\r\n\r\nNothing more.\r\n\r\nNor were any signs of that unfortunate brig seen next day.  No boat\r\nfloated towards the island, nor was a single spar ever picked up along\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe the feelings of the Crusoes as they\r\nwent slowly homeward through the jungle, guided by Fitz and Bob.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.\"  That was all the remark\r\nthat James Malone made.\r\n\r\nAnd the mystery of that unhappy brig none can ever unravel.\r\n\r\nTo the end of time it must remain one of the awful secrets of the sea.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ADVENTURES IN A CRYSTALLINE CAVE.\r\n\r\nTen months more, and not another ship was seen.\r\n\r\nIt was now two years and over since the beautiful barque _Sea Flower_\r\nhad sailed away from Southampton.  Not a very long time, it may be said.\r\nNo; and yet it seemed a century to look back upon, so many strange\r\nevents and adventures had been crowded into those four-and-twenty\r\nmonths, and so much sorrow and suffering too.\r\n\r\n\"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.\"\r\n\r\nAh! the hearts of all were sad and sick enough by this time.\r\n\r\n\"Some day, some day a ship will come!\"\r\n\r\nEvery one fore and aft was weary with repeating these words.\r\n\r\nThey went not now so often to the foot of Fire Hill, as the volcano had\r\ncome to be called, in search of the buried cave.\r\n\r\nA buried cave it doubtless was, covered entirely by the flow of lava\r\nfrom the crater, and lost, it would seem, for ever.\r\n\r\nBut whole days would be spent in rambling about in search of the only\r\nkind of game the lonely island afforded, those small black pigs and the\r\nrock-rabbits, or in fishing by stream or at sea.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"at sea,\" it must not be imagined that they fished in\r\nTreachery Bay.  No; for to have done so would doubtless have invited the\r\nattention of the savages, and they might have paid the island a visit\r\nthat would have been very little relished.  Natives of those South\r\nPacific islands have keen eyesight.\r\n\r\nBut the dinghy boat had been hauled right across the island and launched\r\nin a little bay there.  A cave was found, and this formed a capital\r\nboat-house, for it rose so high behind that the tide could not reach it.\r\n\r\nThe time had come when fishing was very necessary indeed, for well\r\n\"found\" though the _Sea Flower_ had been, especially with all kinds of\r\ntinned provisions and biscuits, these had been nearly all consumed, and\r\nfor some months back the Crusoes had depended for their support almost\r\nentirely on rod and gun.  I say _almost_ advisedly; for many kinds of\r\nvegetables and roots grew wild in this lonely island, not to mention\r\nfruits, the most wholesome and delicious that any one could desire.\r\n\r\nAh, reader, do not imagine that because you have eaten bananas, or even\r\nguavas, which you have purchased in this country, that you can form a\r\nperfect idea of the flavour and lusciousness of those fruits when\r\ngathered from the trees in their native wilds.  Moreover, there are\r\nfruits in the woods of the Pacific islands so tender that they could not\r\nbe carried by sea, nor kept for even a day in the tropics; and these are\r\nthe best of all.  So that on Misfortune Island there was no danger of\r\nstarvation, unless indeed the Crusoes should have the misfortune to be\r\nsurrounded by the savages and placed in a state of siege.\r\n\r\nIt was against such an eventuality that the last of the tinned meats was\r\nso carefully reserved: and the last of the coals too, because these\r\nlatter would be needed for the donkey engine, to make steam to be\r\ncondensed and used as drinking water.\r\n\r\nThree times a week, at least in good weather, did a little band set out\r\nfor the fishing cove, and this consisted of Ransey Tansey himself,\r\nNelda, and little Fitz, to say nothing of Bob.\r\n\r\nNow the cove was quite six miles away.  Six miles going and six coming\r\nback would have been too long a journey for Nelda; but as the child\r\nliked to accompany the boys, and they were delighted to have her\r\ncompany, the two lads consulted together and concluded they must carry\r\nher at least half the way.\r\n\r\nThis was a capital plan for Nelda, and quite romantic, for the _modus\r\nportandi_ was a grass hammock suspended from a long bamboo pole, one end\r\nresting on Ransey's shoulder, the other on Fitz's.\r\n\r\nNelda would be talking or singing all the way.  But on the return\r\njourney she got down more often, because she never went back without a\r\nbasket well filled with fruit and flowers.\r\n\r\nBob used to trot on in front always.  This he deemed it his duty to do.\r\nWas he not a guard?\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions the Admiral also formed part of the expedition, but he\r\npreferred not going to sea in that wobbly boat.\r\n\r\nWhen invited to embark, he would simply look at Babs or Ransey with one\r\nwise red eye, and say, \"No, thank you, dear.  A sea life doesn't quite\r\nsuit my constitution; and if it is all the same to you, I'll just hop\r\nabout the beach here until you all return.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not take a very long time for the children, as I may still call\r\nthem, to find all the fish they could conveniently carry.  Then they\r\nreturned to the beach, entered the cave, and cooked their dinner.\r\n\r\nThey invariably started to go back two or three hours before sunset.\r\n\r\nAbout this cave there was a kind of mystery to the imaginative mind of\r\nlittle Nelda, and she peopled the gloom and darkness far beyond with all\r\nsorts of strange beings.\r\n\r\nBut when one day Ransey Tansey proposed exploring it, she evinced very\r\nmuch reluctance to going herself.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" she said; \"the giants might catch me and kill me.\"\r\n\r\nFitz laughed, and Ransey assured her that the cave was not inhabited by\r\neven a single giant.  It was all imagination.\r\n\r\n\"There might be snakes,\" she persisted, \"or awful alligators.\"\r\n\r\nFitz laughed again, and Nelda felt more assured.\r\n\r\n\"You see me go, sah!\" he said; \"Is'e not afraid.  Ha, ha! it take one\r\nmuch big giant and plenty big 'gator to flighten dis chile.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran out of the cave now, but soon came back carrying a heap of\r\nwithered grass and foliage.\r\n\r\nThen he snatched up a burning brand.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" he cried, \"dis chile done go to 'vestigate.\"\r\n\r\nFitz was fond of exploiting a big word, although he never succeeded in\r\npronouncing much more than three-quarters of it.\r\n\r\nPresently the brave little lad disappeared, for the darkness had\r\nswallowed him up.\r\n\r\nThe cave at its other end turned to the right and then to the left, so\r\nthat although Fitz lit his fire it could not be seen by those left\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nRansey and Nelda were becoming quite uneasy about him, when suddenly his\r\nvoice was heard in the dark distance, coming nearer and nearer every\r\nmoment, till he once more stood in the broad glare of day at the main\r\nentrance to the cave.\r\n\r\n\"So glad you've come back, Fitz,\" cried Ransey, \"for we had almost given\r\nyou up; we thought the 'gators had swallowed you.\"\r\n\r\nNelda, too, was glad, and so was honest Bob.  He ran round and round\r\nhim, barking.\r\n\r\nThe echo of the far interior took up the sound and gave back \"wowff\" for\r\n\"wowff,\" much to the dog's astonishment.  He made quite sure that\r\nanother dog was hiding away in the darkness somewhere, and promised\r\nhimself the infinite pleasure of shaking him out of his skin some day.\r\n\r\nBut the story of exploration that Fitz had to tell was indeed a\r\nwonderful one.\r\n\r\nHe had found an interior cave, and when he lit his fire, the sight of\r\nit, he declared to Ransey, was far more beautiful than Paradise.  All\r\naround him, he said, was a mass of icicles, but all of crystal, and on\r\nthe floor were hundreds and hundreds of great crystal candles.\r\n\r\n\"I not can splain [explain] propah,\" he said.  \"Too much foh one leetle\r\nniggah boy to splain, but all about me dat cave sparkle and shine wid\r\ndiamonds, rubies, and rainbows.\"\r\n\r\nSo before they got home that night they made up their minds to explore\r\nthe marvellous cave in company.\r\n\r\nNothing was said to any one else about their intention; only when they\r\nset out some days after this to go to the cave as usual, Ransey Tansey\r\ntook with him several blue, red, and white lights.  He determined in his\r\nown mind that this stalactite cave should be turned into a kind of fairy\r\npalace for once in a way.\r\n\r\nHe also carried a small bull's-eye lantern, so that when lights went out\r\nthey should not be plunged into darkness altogether.\r\n\r\nThey had been rather longer than usual in starting on this particular\r\nmorning, and as the day was very beautiful, and the trees and flowers,\r\nbutterflies and birds, all looking bright and gay, they must have\r\nlingered long on the road.  At all events, it was quite one o'clock\r\nbefore they arrived at the cove, reached the cave, and launched their\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nThe fish, moreover, seemed to-day anxious to be caught, and excellent\r\nsport was enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIt only wanted two hours to sunset when they regained the mouth of the\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nThere would be moonlight to guide them home, however, even if they\r\nshould be half an hour late.\r\n\r\nYes, and it was a full moon too.  Mark this, reader, for with each full\r\nmoon comes a spring tide!\r\n\r\nI have no words to convey to any one the glorious sight they beheld when\r\nthey at last entered the stalactite cave and lit their fire of wood and\r\ngrass.  Fitz had described it well--crystal icicles all around hanging\r\nfrom the vaulted roof, and raised high above the snow-white floor; walls\r\nof crystal, and strange, weird statues of a kind of marble.\r\n\r\nThey sat there in silent admiration until the fire began to burn low;\r\nthen Ransey Tansey lit up the cave, first with a dazzling white light,\r\nthen with blue, and finally with crimson.\r\n\r\nAnd this ended the show, but it was one that Nelda would dream about for\r\nweeks to come.\r\n\r\nHow long they had stayed in this wondrous cave they could not tell, but,\r\nlo! to their dismay, when they reached the place where they had drawn up\r\nthe boat, it was gone, and the waves were lapping up far inside.  The\r\ndinghy had been floated away, and they were thus imprisoned for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe moon, too, had gone down, for in these seas it neither rises nor\r\nsets at the same time it does in Britain.\r\n\r\nLittle Nelda was afraid to spend the night near to the dark water.  Some\r\nawful beast, she said, might come out and drag her in, so back they went\r\nto the crystal cave.  Alas! it had lost its charm now.\r\n\r\nWhat a lonesome, weary time it was, and they dared not leave before\r\ndaylight!\r\n\r\nThe fearless boy Fitz, after many, many hours had passed, went away,\r\nlike a bird from the ark, to see if the waters were yet assuaged.  He\r\nbrought back word that the sun was rising, but that the water was still\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, they had all slept without knowing it, and during this\r\ntime the tide had gone back and once more risen, or, in other words, it\r\nhad ebbed and flowed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of Tandy and the others on board the hulk may be better\r\nimagined than described when night fell and the wanderers did not\r\nreturn.  For a time they expected them every minute, for the moon was\r\nstill shining bright and clear in the west and tipping the waves with\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nTandy set out by himself at last, hoping to meet the little party.  He\r\nwalked for fully two miles along the track by which they most often\r\ncame.  Again and again he shouted and listened, but no answering shout\r\ncame back to his, though he could hear now and then the dreary cry of a\r\nnight-bird as it flew low over the woods in the gauzy glamour that the\r\nmoon was shedding over everything.\r\n\r\nBut the moon itself would shortly sink, and so, uncertain what to do\r\nnext, he returned, hoping against hope that the children might have\r\nreached the hulk before him.\r\n\r\nWhat a long, dreary night it was!  No one slept much.  Of this I am\r\nsure, for the lost ones were friends both fore and aft.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest sorrow was to come, for, lo! when next morning at\r\ndaybreak they reached the cave, the first thing that caught their eyes\r\nwas the dinghy--beached, but bottom uppermost.  Fishing gear and the\r\noars were also picked up; but, of course, there was no sign of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWith grief, poor Tandy almost took leave of his senses, and it was\r\nindeed a pitiable sight to see him wandering aimlessly to and fro upon\r\nthe coral beach, casting many a hopeless glance seawards.\r\n\r\nGood, indeed, would it have been for him had tears come to his relief.\r\nBut these were denied him.  Even the consolations that honest James\r\nMalone poured into his ears were unheeded; perhaps they were hardly even\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\"Death comes to all sooner or later.  We do wrong to repine.  Ah, my\r\ndear Tandy, God Himself knows what is best for us, and our sorrows here\r\nwill all be joys in the land where you and I must be ere long.\"\r\n\r\nWell-meant platitudes, doubtless, but they brought no comfort to the\r\nanguished heart of the poor father.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed by one of the men that the strange bird Admiral, who had\r\naccompanied the search party, seemed plunged in grief himself.  He\r\nwalked about the beach, but ate nothing.  He perched upon the keel of\r\nthe upset boat, and over and over again he turned his long neck\r\ndownwards, and wonderingly gazed upon the fishing gear and oars.\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the cave where we left our smaller heroes.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey's greatest grief was in thinking about his father.  It\r\nwould be quite a long time yet before the tide ebbed sufficiently to\r\npermit them to leave the cave and scramble along the beach to the top of\r\nthe cove.  Well, there was nothing for it but to wait.  But this waiting\r\nhad a curious ending.\r\n\r\nThey had returned to the stalactite cave, and Ransey had once more lit\r\nhis lamp, when suddenly, far at the other end, they heard something that\r\nmade poor Nelda quake with fear and cling to her brother's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is a ghost!\" she cried--\"an old woman's ghost!\"\r\n\r\nI cannot otherwise describe the sound than as a weary kind of half sigh,\r\nhalf moan, on a loud falsetto key.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Nelda thought it emanated from some old lady's ghost; though\r\nwhat an old lady's ghost could possibly be doing down here, it would\r\nhave been difficult indeed to guess.\r\n\r\nBob took another view of the matter.  He barked loudly and lustily, and\r\nrushed forward.  It was no angry bark, however.\r\n\r\nNext minute he came running back, and when Ransey Tansey turned the\r\nlight on him he could see by the commotion among the long, rough hair\r\nwhich covered his rump that the fag-end of a tail he possessed was being\r\nviolently but joyfully agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he seemed to say; \"follow me.  You will be surprised!\"\r\n\r\nWithout fear now, the children followed the dog, and, lo! not far off,\r\nstanding solemnly in a kind of crystalline pulpit, was the Admiral\r\nhimself.  No wonder they were all astonished, or that the bird himself\r\nseemed pleased.  But off the crane hopped now, the dog and the children\r\ntoo following, and there, not thirty yards from the place where they had\r\nbeen all night, was a landward opening into the cave.\r\n\r\nIt was surrounded with bush, and how the Admiral had found it must ever\r\nremain a mystery.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after this poor Tandy was clasping his children to his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nInnocent wee Babs was patting his cheek, and saying, \"Never mind,\r\ndaddy--never mind, dear daddy.\"  Childish consolation certainly, but,\r\noh, so sweet!  No wonder his pent-up feelings were relieved by tears at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nThe crane allayed _his_ feelings by dancing a _pas de joie_ on the coral\r\nsand.  Bob gave vent to his by rushing about and barking at everything\r\nand everybody, but especially at the boat, which he seemed to regard as\r\nthe innocent cause of all the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Wowff--wowff--wow!  Why did it run away anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nThat is what Bob wanted to know.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBut the tide had ebbed sufficiently to permit of a visit to the cave of\r\ndelight, as Ransey called it.\r\n\r\nJames and Tandy, with Ransey and Fitz, embarked, the others remaining on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nBoth men were as much delighted and astonished at what they saw as the\r\nchildren themselves had been.  A large quantity of withered branches and\r\nfoliage had been taken in the boat, to make a fire in the crystalline\r\ncave.\r\n\r\n\"But oh, father,\" said Ransey, \"you should have seen it last night when\r\nwe lit it up with crimson light!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll come again, lad,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\nThey then made their way to the outer opening, and back once more to the\r\ninner, where they had left the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that James Malone was somewhat silent all the way back to\r\nthe wreck.  And so he continued during breakfast.  After this he slowly\r\narose.  \"Brother,\" he said, laying his hand on Halcott's shoulder, \"I\r\nhave something strange to tell you.  Come to the cliff-top, and you too,\r\nTandy, and bring your pipes.\"\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nENTOMBED ALIVE.\r\n\r\nIt was a very lovely day now.  The sea all round towards the eastern\r\nside of the island was deep and blue; but the waters to the west were\r\nhere and there more shallow, so that the ocean here was patched with\r\nsplendid colouring--tints of opal, tender green, and crimson were set\r\noff by the deep dark-brown of a rocky bottom, whereon masses of sea-weed\r\nwaved with the ebb or the flow of the tide.\r\n\r\nThere was not a breath of wind to-day, not a whisper in the woodlands;\r\nscarce a sound was to be heard, save the drowsy hum of the waves as they\r\nbroke far below on the beach of snow-white sand, or the occasional\r\nscreaming of the sea-birds sailing round and round the beetling crags\r\nwhere their nests were.\r\n\r\nIn very joy they seemed to scream to-day.  Happy birds!  There was no\r\none to molest them on this far-off beautiful isle of the ocean.  No gun\r\nwas ever levelled at them, not a pebble ever thrown even by Fitz; and so\r\ntame were they that they often ran about the cliff-top, or even alighted\r\non the ship itself.\r\n\r\nBut slowly indeed to-day does James Malone walk towards the cliff.  Out\r\nthrough the inner, out through the great outer gate; for he will not\r\nfeel comfortable until he is clear of the encampment, and seated near to\r\nthe very brink of that great wall of rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, when at last he had filled and lit his pipe with\r\nall the coolness of a North American Indian--\"gentlemen, hitherto all\r\nour efforts to find the gold mine have been in vain, but mere chance has\r\nrevealed to us the secret that has been hidden from us so long--\"\r\n\r\n\"James,\" said Tandy, excitedly, \"you don't mean to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" interrupted James, \"I do mean to say it, Tandy.  Halcott there\r\nknows that I seldom make an assertion till I have well-considered the\r\nmatter on all sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never do, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"That cave, gentlemen, which in so strange a way the children have\r\nfound, is a gold mine--_the_ gold mine!\r\n\r\n\"The land entrance I can now remember, although it is somewhat changed.\r\nShow me the map of the island, brother.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott spread it out before him.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out Fire Hill, then drew his finger along until it rested on\r\nthe spot where the cave was.\r\n\r\n\"The fault has been all mine, gentlemen; I alone led you astray, for\r\nappearances deceived me.  But it is not yet too late.\r\n\r\n\"And so you see, Tandy, that, after all, Providence has changed our\r\nmourning into joy.  I do not now despair of anything.  God moves in a\r\nmysterious way, brothers, and you may rest assured we shall yet return\r\nin peace to enjoy the fruits of our labours in the land of our birth.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott was silent; so too was Tandy for a time.\r\n\r\nNeed I tell you what they were thinking about?  If they could but return\r\nwith enough gold to give them an independence, how pleasant would be\r\ntheir prospects for the future!\r\n\r\nWell, this world is not all sorrow, and it is only right we should enjoy\r\nit.  I think I can honestly go further, reader, and say it is a sin not\r\nto make the best of the beautiful world we live in, a sin to look always\r\nat the darkest side when clouds surround us.  Let us not believe in the\r\npessimism of Burns when he wrote his dirge \"Man was made to mourn,\" a\r\nverse or two of which run as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Look not alone on youthful prime,\r\n      Or manhood's active might;\r\n  Man then is useful to his kind,\r\n      Supported is his right:\r\n  But see him on the edge of life,\r\n      With cares and sorrows worn;\r\n  Then age and want--oh! ill-matched pair!--\r\n      Show man was made to mourn.\r\n\r\n  \"A few seem favourites of fate,\r\n      In pleasure's lap carest;\r\n  Yet think not all the rich and great\r\n      Are likewise truly blest.\r\n  But, oh! what crowds in every land\r\n      Are wretched and forlorn!\r\n  Through weary life this lesson learn--\r\n      that man was made to mourn.\"\r\n\r\nTandy had risen to his feet, and was looking somewhat anxiously towards\r\nObservatory Hill.\r\n\r\nThe seaman who took day and day about with Fitz in watching was at this\r\nmoment signalling.\r\n\r\n\"He wants us to come up,\" said Tandy.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows,\" said James, with far more cheerfulness in his voice than\r\nusual--\"who knows but that our deliverance is already at hand?  The man\r\nmay have seen a ship!\"\r\n\r\nHalcott and Tandy, about an hour after this, stood beside the man on the\r\nbrow of the hill, with their glasses turned towards the far-off island.\r\n\r\nThey could see the beach with far greater clearness than usual to-day.\r\n\r\nIt was crowded with savages running to and fro, into the bush and out of\r\nit, in a state apparently of great excitement.\r\n\r\nAt this distance they resembled nothing more than a hive of bees about\r\nto swarm.\r\n\r\nIndependent of innumerable dug-outs drawn up here and there were no less\r\nthan five huge war-canoes.\r\n\r\nTandy turned away with a slight sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the cup of joy,\" he said, \"was being held to our lips,\r\nill-fortune seems to have snatched it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heigho!\" sighed Halcott, \"how I envy honest James for the hopefulness\r\nthat he never appears to lose, even in the very darkest hours, the hours\r\nof what we should call despair.\r\n\r\n\"But look,\" he continued, pointing towards Fire Hill.  \"Not a cloud to\r\nbe seen!\"\r\n\r\n\"The volcano is dead!\" said Tandy, with knitted brows; \"and now, indeed,\r\nwe shall have to fight.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott took Tandy's hand, while he looked calmly into his face.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"we have come through many and many a danger side\r\nby side, and here we are alive and well to tell it.  If fighting it must\r\nbe with these savages, neither you nor I shall be afraid to face them.\r\nBut we may succeed in making peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Halcott, I fear their friendship even more than their enmity.  But\r\nfor my dear boy and my little girl, I should care for neither.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now all haste back to the camp was made.\r\n\r\nAll hands were summoned, and the case laid plainly before them.\r\n\r\nThe story of the cave was told to them also, and it did Halcott's heart\r\ngood to hear the ringing cheer with which their words were received.\r\n\r\nThe next thing Halcott ordered was a survey of stores.  Alas! this did\r\nnot take long; and afterwards the defences were most carefully\r\ninspected.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the outlook was a hopeful one, even if the savages did\r\ncome in force and place the strange little encampment in a state of\r\nsiege.  Their provisions and even their ammunition would last for three\r\nweeks at least.\r\n\r\nAnd--and then?\r\n\r\nAh! no one thought of an answer to that question.  They meant to do\r\ntheir best, and trust in Providence for everything else.\r\n\r\nBut the expected arrival of these warlike natives was not going to\r\nprevent them from finding gold, if gold there were in the Medicine-man's\r\nCave, as it was now named.\r\n\r\nSo early next morning the discovery party had reached the landward\r\nopening.  They were provided with lamps to light and hang, with tools,\r\nand with provisions for the day.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the cave Fitz was stationed with glass in hand, to watch\r\nfor a signal to be given from Observatory Hill, in case the boats should\r\nstart from the distant island.\r\n\r\nThe lamps were lit at the entrance to the cave, which was gloomy enough\r\nin all conscience.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" cried Tom Wilson, when they reached the interior and saw the\r\ngreat stalactites, the candles and icicles of glass, and the walls all\r\nshining with \"rubies and rainbows,\"--\"surely this is the cave of\r\nAladdin.  Ah, it is diamonds as well as gold we ought to be able to\r\ncollect here, maties!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now hours were spent in a fruitless search for the mine.  Even the\r\nfloor of the seaward cave was dug up and its walls tapped, but all in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they were preparing to leave, that, chancing to hear\r\nBob whining and scraping not ten yards from the outer entrance, Halcott\r\nturned his attention in that direction.\r\n\r\nA ghastly sight met their gaze!  For here lay a pile of human bones half\r\ncovered with dust, and half buried in the debris that had fallen from\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\nAnd near this awful heap, but above it, was a hole about five feet high,\r\nand wide enough to admit two men at a time.\r\n\r\nThe excitement now was intense, but for a time all stood spell-bound\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said James, slowly, \"is the spot where that fiend, the\r\nmedicine-man, murdered the boys as an offering to the great fire-fiend.\r\nNow we shall find the gold.  Come, follow me, men!\"\r\n\r\nHe took a lamp from Tom Wilson's hand as he spoke, and boldly entered\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nIt was far from an inviting place where they now stood.\r\n\r\nWhat did that signify to those determined gold-seekers?  For hardly had\r\nthey dug two feet down ere they were rewarded by finding one large,\r\nrough nugget of pure gold and several small ones.\r\n\r\nThey forgot all about the savages now, and nothing could exceed the\r\neagerness with which the men laboured.  But fatigue, at last, overcame\r\nthem, and they were obliged to retire, carrying with them more of the\r\nprecious ore than many an Australian digger has found during a whole\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark as they made their way through the bush; but Fitz was\r\nan excellent guide, so they got back in time for supper.\r\n\r\nA very happy evening this was, fore and aft, and Tom Wilson seemed the\r\ngayest of the gay.  The poor fellow had sinned and fallen, it is true,\r\nbut surely God had already forgiven him.  Tom believed so, and it was\r\nthis belief, he told James more than once, that made him forget his\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n\"I'll meet my wife and children on the other shore,\" he said once, with\r\na sad smile, \"and they'll forgive me too.\"\r\n\r\nIn a week's time the gold fever was at its height.  And no wonder, for\r\nin whatever direction they dug nuggets were found in this marvellous\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of every man there was made.\r\n\r\nBut would the gold be of any use to them?\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOne day, about a fortnight after the wonderful discovery, something very\r\nstartling occurred.  Almost every hour while digging they had heard\r\nstrange sounds, like the rumbling of heavy artillery along a rough road,\r\nwith now and then a loud but muffled report, as of a great gun fired in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\nNo wonder James had remarked that the heathen minds of the savages\r\nbelieved that a great fire-fiend dwelt deep down here, and must be\r\npropitiated with human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular day, after a terrible report, the earth shook and\r\nquivered, great masses of soil fell crashing down here and there, and\r\nthe lamps were all extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe noise died away like the muttering of a thunderstorm in the far\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet and cool, men; we are all right.  We can relight the lamps.\"\r\nIt was Halcott who spoke.\r\n\r\nYes, and so they quickly did; but judge of their horror when, on making\r\ntheir way to what had been the entrance to the cave, they found no exit\r\nthere!\r\n\r\nThen the terrible truth revealed itself to them--they were entombed\r\nalive!\r\n\r\nAt first the horror of the situation rendered them speechless.\r\n\r\nWas it the heat of internal fires, or was it terror--I know not which--\r\nthat made the perspiration stand in great beads on their now pale faces?\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" cried one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"Never despair, lad!\"--and Halcott's manly voice was heard once\r\nmore--\"never despair!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded hollow, however--hollow, and far away.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\n\"ON SWEPT THE WAR-CANOES TOWARDS THE CORAL BEACH.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was just here, was it not,\" said Halcott, \"where the entrance was?\r\nKeep up your hearts, boys, we shall soon dig ourselves clear.\"\r\n\r\nCheered by his voice, every one set himself bravely to the task before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut a whole hour went by, and they were now nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nOne or more had thrown themselves on the ground panting.\r\n\r\nThe heat increased every minute, and the atmosphere became stifling.\r\nThe thirst, too, was almost unendurable.\r\n\r\nEven James himself was yielding at last to despair, and already the\r\nlights were burning more dimly.\r\n\r\nBut hark! the sound of the dog barking.  His voice seemed ever so far\r\naway, but every heart was cheered by it.\r\n\r\nAgain, lads, again!  Up with your spades; one more effort.\r\n\r\nThe men sprang up from the floor of the cave and went to work now with a\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer the dog's anxious barking sounded every minute.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a joyous cry, Bob burst through, and with him came a\r\nwelcome rush of pure air.\r\n\r\nThey were saved!\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that when they found themselves once more out in the\r\njungle, with flowers and foliage all around them and the breath of\r\nheaven fanning their faces, James Malone proposed a prayer of\r\nthankfulness?\r\n\r\nThey rose from their knees at last.\r\n\r\n\"We have been taught a lesson,\" said this honest fellow; \"our ambition\r\nwas far too overweening.  Our lust for gold all but found us a grave.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThey had arrived early at camp, so Tandy and Halcott determined to make\r\nanother visit to Observatory Hill, for the man had once more signalled.\r\n\r\nExtra activity was apparent among the savages in the northern island.\r\nIt was evident enough now that they would not long delay their coming.\r\n\r\nThe sun set, and soon afterwards darkness fell, but still the man\r\nlingered on the hill-top.\r\n\r\nAnd now they could see a great fire spring up, just a little way from\r\nthe water's edge, and soon the savages were observed dancing wildly\r\naround it in three or four great circles.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that some horrible orgie was taking place, and they might\r\neasily presume that the medicine-man was busy enough, and that a human\r\nsacrifice was being offered up to appease the fiends of war, in which\r\nthose benighted beings so firmly believed.\r\n\r\nNext day, and just after breakfast, on looking towards the hill-top,\r\nbehold the red British ensign afloat on the flag-pole!\r\n\r\nShortly after this the signalman himself ran in.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming!\" he cried; \"they are coming!\"\r\n\r\n\"And their strength?\" asked Halcott calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Five great war-canoes, and each one of them contains at least thirty\r\narmed warriors.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there may be more to follow.  Humph!  Well, we shall have to reckon\r\nwith between two and three hundred at least.  What about making\r\novertures of peace to them, brother James?\"\r\n\r\nNow brother James, as has already been said, was a very practical kind\r\nof a Christian.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, slowly and thoughtfully, \"I think, Charlie Halcott,\r\nthat in this case our duty lies straight and clear before us, and we've\r\ngot to go for it.  We shall just be content to make war first, and leave\r\nthe peace to follow.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man heard him, and the hearty British cheer they gave was\r\nre-echoed even from the hill itself.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed by all, however, that to fight these savages in the open\r\nwould be but to court death and destruction to all hands.\r\n\r\nOther tactics must be adopted.  The enemy would no doubt land on the\r\nbeach, and so the big gun was dragged towards the cliff-top.  Here they\r\nwould make their first stand, and, if possible, sink some of the\r\nwar-canoes before they had a chance to land.\r\n\r\nIn savage warfare cover is considered of very great importance.  It was\r\ndetermined, therefore, to deprive the invaders of this at any cost, so\r\nheaps of withered branches and foliage were collected and placed here\r\nand there all around the bay and close to the edge of the wood; and not\r\nonly there, but on the table-land itself, between the encampment and\r\nObservatory Hill.\r\n\r\nOne of the most active young men was told off to fire those heaps,\r\nbeginning at the farther side of the bay.  His signal to do so would be\r\na rifle, not the gun, fired from the top of the cliff.\r\n\r\nIn less than three hours' time the great war-canoes were quite in view,\r\nslowly approaching the land.  They were still ten miles away, however,\r\nand it was evident to every one that they meant to time themselves so as\r\nto land on the beach at Treachery Bay about an hour after sunset.\r\n\r\nAnother hour went slowly by.  Through the glasses now a good view could\r\nbe had of the cannibal warriors.  One and all were painted in a manner\r\nthat was as hideous as it was grotesque.  In the first boat, standing\r\nerect in the bows, with a huge spear in his hand, the head of which was\r\nevidently of gold, for it glittered yellow in the sun's rays, was a\r\nstalwart savage, whom James Malone at once pronounced to be the king.\r\nBeside him squatted two deformed and horrible-looking savages, and they\r\nalso were far too well-known to James.  They were the king's chief\r\nmedicine-men.\r\n\r\nAt the bow of each war-canoe, stuck on a pole, was a ghastly human head,\r\nno doubt those of prisoners taken in battles fought with tribes living\r\non other islands.  There was no doubt, therefore, that their intentions\r\nin visiting the Crusoes were evil and not good, and that James Malone's\r\nadvice to fight first and make peace afterwards was wise, and the only\r\none to be pursued.\r\n\r\nAt sunset they were within two miles of the land, and lying-to, ready to\r\nmake a dash as soon as darkness fell.\r\n\r\nThe gun belonging to the _Sea Flower_ was a small breechloader of good\r\npattern, and could carry a shell quite as far as the boats.\r\n\r\nIt was trained upon them, and great was the terror of the king when in\r\nthe air, right above his head, the shell burst with a terrible roar.\r\n\r\nThey put about and rowed further off at once.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after a short twilight, the night descended quickly over land\r\nand sea.\r\n\r\nIt was very still and starry, and in a very short time the thumping and\r\nnoise of the oars told those on watch that the boats were rapidly\r\napproaching.  And now the rifle was fired.\r\n\r\nSackbut, the young sailor, had been provided with a can of petroleum and\r\nmatches, and hardly had the sound of the rifle ceased to reverberate\r\nfrom the rocks ere those on the cliff saw the first fire lighted.\r\nRunning from heap to heap he quickly set fire to them one by one.  Up on\r\nto the table-land he came next, and so in less than twenty minutes the\r\nwhole of this part of the island presented a barrier of rolling fire\r\ntowards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe fire lit up the whole bay until it was as bright almost as if the\r\nsun were shining on it.  But the savages were not to be deterred or\r\ndenied, and so on swept the great war-canoes towards the coral beach.\r\n\r\nYet, although they succeeded at last in effecting a landing, they had\r\npaid dear for their daring.\r\n\r\nSeven rifles played incessantly on them, and the howls and yells that\r\nrose every now and then on the night air told that the firing was not in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nOnly a few shots were fired from the gun, there being no time, but a\r\nshell crashed into the very midst of one of the war-canoes, and the\r\ndestruction must have been terrible.  She sank at once, and probably not\r\nmore than ten out of the thirty succeeded in swimming ashore.\r\n\r\nThe sharks had scented the battle from afar, and were soon on the field\r\nenjoying a horrid feast.\r\n\r\nWith that bursting shell the war might be said to have commenced in\r\nearnest, and it was to be a war _a outrance_, knife to knife, and to the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe yelling of the savages now, and their frantic gestures as they\r\nrushed in mass to the shelter of the rocks, mingling with the crackling\r\nand roaring of the flames and the frightened screams of myriads of\r\nsea-gulls, was fearful--a noise and din that it would be difficult\r\nindeed to describe.\r\n\r\nAll haste was now made to get the gun inside the first line of defence,\r\nload it with canister, and place it where it would be most handy.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing more could be done now until the savages should once more\r\nput in an appearance.  So Tandy hurried on board, a sadly anxious man\r\nindeed.  His anxiety was, of course, centred in his little daughter.\r\n\r\nJaneira was the first to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nelda?\" he said quickly; \"where is she, and how is she, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Jane, \"she cry plenty at fuss, sah, cry and dance, but now\r\nshe done go to bed, sah; come, sah, come.\"\r\n\r\nAnd down below she ran.\r\n\r\nPoor Nelda!  There she lay in her bunk, pale and frightened-looking.\r\n\r\nNo tears now though; only smiles and caresses for her father.  She had\r\none arm round Bob, who was stretched out beside the child, as if to\r\nguard her from threatened danger.\r\n\r\nBut strange and earnest were the questions she had to ask.\r\n\r\nWere the savages all killed, and shot, and drowned?  Would they come\r\nback again?  Would Ransey, and Bob, and the 'Rallie, and poor daddie be\r\nkilled and roasted if the awful men came with their spears and knives,\r\nand their bows and arrows?\r\n\r\nTandy did all he could to assure her, and if in doing so he had to\r\nequivocate a little, surely he would be forgiven.\r\n\r\nAs they were still talking, in at the door stalked the Admiral himself.\r\nHe looked more solemn than any one had ever seen him before.  Poor\r\nfellow! he too had received a terrible fright, and I suppose he felt\r\nthat he would never, never care to dance again.\r\n\r\nThe child called to him, and he came to the bunk-side at once, and\r\nlowering his long, beautiful neck, laid his beak across her neck.  This\r\nwas 'Rallie's way of showing affection.\r\n\r\nThen he went slowly and sadly away to the other end of the cabin, and\r\n\"trussed\" himself in a corner.\r\n\r\nTandy stopped for two whole hours with Nelda.  She promised to be very\r\ngood, and not to cry, even if the bad men did come back again.\r\n\r\nThen she fell soundly asleep, holding her father's finger.\r\n\r\nHe kissed her now and quietly left the cabin, and Janeira herself\r\nslipped in and took the camp-stool Tandy had just vacated.\r\n\r\nThe fire was by this time a long distance away, only the trees that had\r\nnot been destroyed stood at one moment like black spectres in the\r\nstarlight, but like rugged pillars of crimson and gold when a puff of\r\nwind swept through the woods.\r\n\r\nWaiting and watching!  Ah, what a weary thing it is!  Hours and hours\r\npassed by, and if the men of this little garrison slept at all, it was\r\non the bare ground, and with only their elbows for pillows.\r\n\r\nBut not until far on in the morning watch did the enemy show signs of\r\nactivity, or give a single token of their presence.\r\n\r\nThe fire was now too far back for the crackling of the flames to be\r\nheard, though its red glare and the cloud of rolling smoke that obscured\r\nthe sky told that it was still blazing fiercely.  The sea-birds had gone\r\nto rest once more in the rocks, and everything around the encampment was\r\nas silent as the grave.  A dread silence--a stillness like that which\r\nprecedes the outbreaking of some fearful storm!\r\n\r\nAnd all too soon the storm burst.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\n\"AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.\"\r\n\r\nWith a yell that once more scared the sea-birds, and sent them screaming\r\nin terror across the waves, a yell that seemed to awaken the echoes in\r\nevery rock and hill from end to end of the island, the savages sprang to\r\ntheir feet, and rushing towards the palisade, made their first fearful\r\nonset.\r\n\r\nNot twenty yards away were they when they had given voice.  So quickly,\r\ntoo, did they rush across the intervening ground, that scarce was there\r\ntime to fire a rifle volley, far less to train the gun upon the\r\nspear-armed mass, before it was close alongside and had surrounded the\r\nstockade.\r\n\r\nIn their hundreds, these fearsome savages attempted to scale it; but\r\ntheir bodies were frightfully torn with the spikes, and cries of pain\r\nnow mingled with those of anger.  The defenders ran from one part of the\r\nstockade to another, firing from the loopholes; and so densely massed\r\ntogether was the foe that every bullet must have found a billet.  In\r\nspite of all this, several managed to get over, but were immediately\r\nshot down with revolvers, or cut down with sword or cutlass.\r\n\r\nSmall though the loopholes were, spears were several times thrust\r\nthrough, and as each of them was poisoned, a single scratch would have\r\nresulted in the agonised death of the receiver.\r\n\r\nDark enough it was, and with nothing now but the stars to direct their\r\naim, yet the little band fought well and determinedly, and at last the\r\nfoe retired, leaving scores of their dead behind--drew off, dragging the\r\nwounded away.\r\n\r\nAt that black mass, just as it was nearing the woods, and while the\r\nrifles still played upon it, the breechloader, grape-loaded, was trained\r\nand fired.\r\n\r\nSo close together were the natives that the carnage must have been\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nBut twice again ere morning they attacked the fort, receiving the same\r\ntreatment, and being obliged at last to withdraw.\r\n\r\nWhen morning broke, the defenders were completely wearied out, and so\r\nthe little garrison, after two sentries were set, lay down to snatch a\r\nfew hours' much needed rest.  There was no fear of the attack being\r\nrenewed before sunset, for darkness seemed best to suit the tactics of\r\nthese sable warriors.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of this first day of siege a sally was made from the\r\ngreat gate, and seven men stood ready with their rifles, while four\r\nbegan to remove the dead.  Each was dragged to the edge of the cliff and\r\nthrown over into the sea.  When all were cleared away the gate was once\r\nmore shut and barred.  But though the burial must have been witnessed,\r\nno rush was made by the savages to attack them.  The afternoon was spent\r\nin taking pot-shots at every figure that could be seen in the burned\r\nbush.\r\n\r\nThe next attack was made at midnight, and in a manner quite as\r\ndetermined as the first.\r\n\r\nOne of the _Sea Flower's_ men was killed by a spear.  It had been thrust\r\nwith tremendous force through a loophole, and pierced the poor fellow's\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nTandy himself had a narrow escape.  He was about to fire, but,\r\nstumbling, fell, and next moment a poisoned arrow whizzed past and over\r\nhim.  There was surely a Providence in this, for only fools believe in\r\nblind chance.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the death of poor Ross, who was an able seaman,\r\nthere was no other casualty that night.\r\n\r\nThe savages withdrew, but when, next day, the men of the _Sea Flower_\r\nsallied forth to remove the enemy's dead, which they succeeded in doing,\r\nit was noticed that many of the spike-nails had, during the fight, been\r\nremoved.  These, however, were easily replaced by others, and many more\r\nwere added.\r\n\r\nThere was no attack this evening.  The savages had determined to\r\nendeavour once more to propitiate their \"fiend of war,\" and an immense\r\nfire could be seen burning at midnight in the centre of their camp, not\r\nmore than half a mile from the stockade.  The big gun was trained upon\r\nthis, and a shell planted right in the centre of the dusky mob seemed to\r\nwork great destruction, and quickly put an end to the orgie.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe terrible siege was kept up for three whole weeks, and, harassed\r\nbeyond measure with the constant night attacks, affairs were becoming\r\nvery desperate indeed, and the little garrison was already almost worn\r\nout.  Day after day it was becoming more apparent to all that utter\r\nannihilation was merely a question of time.\r\n\r\nA council of war was held now, at which every man was present, and\r\nvarious proposals were made, but few indeed were feasible.\r\n\r\nThe number of the defenders was so small, compared to the hundreds of\r\narmed savages opposed to them, that a \"sally in force,\" as Tom Wilson\r\nwho proposed this called it, was out of the question.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to make peace would only be to give themselves away.  The\r\nsavage king would be ready enough to promise anything, but in a few\r\nweeks afterwards not one of the poor Crusoes would be left alive.\r\n\r\nShould they get the largest boat ready, provision her, and put to sea?\r\nSurely the ocean itself would be less cruel at its very wildest than\r\nthose bloodthirsty savages.\r\n\r\nThe question had been put by Tandy himself.  He was hoping against hope;\r\nhe was like a drowning man clutching at straws.  For himself he had no\r\nthought.  He was brave almost to a fault, and, like any other brave man,\r\nwas willing to die, sword in hand, fighting the foe.\r\n\r\n  \"And where can man die better,\r\n  Than in facing fearful odds?\"\r\n\r\nBut his children, especially innocent wee Nelda--ah! that was what\r\nsoftened that heart of his.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Tandy,\" said Halcott, \"the idea of being once more away out on\r\nyonder beautiful and peaceful ocean, even if only in an open boat, is\r\none that commends itself to us all, but, alas, it would in this case be\r\nbut a choice of death.  Even if we should succeed in eluding the savages\r\nand escaping, which I believe would be almost impossible, we could never\r\nreach the mainland.\"\r\n\r\nSo the council ended, and the little garrison remained precisely as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to all, however, that the end could not be far distant,\r\nfor not only provisions, but ammunition itself, would soon give out.\r\nAll hands saving Nelda were therefore put on short allowance.  Coals\r\nwere carefully saved, no more being used than was necessary to make\r\nsteam to be condensed and used as drinking water; and not an unnecessary\r\nshot was to be fired.\r\n\r\nBut now there came a lull which lasted for three whole days and nights.\r\nTwo things were evident enough: first, that the enemy were making some\r\nchange in their mode of warfare; secondly, that the final struggle would\r\nsoon take place--and indeed, as regards that, many of the men within the\r\nlittle encampment would have preferred to rush forth, cutlass in hand,\r\nand finish the fighting at once.\r\n\r\nMost of the country was devastated by the fire that had been kindled,\r\nwith the exception of a patch away south and east at the foot of\r\nObservatory Hill, on which the proud ensign was still floating, as if to\r\ngive the besieged some hope and comfort.\r\n\r\nBut one day this patch of jungle, like the famous Birnam Wood, seemed to\r\nbe slowly advancing towards the camp.\r\n\r\nTandy was gazing at it, and looking somewhat puzzled, when Halcott came\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"That is more of their fiendish tactics,\" he said; \"and the scheme, I\r\nfear, will be only too successful.  You see,\" he added, \"they are piling\r\nup heaps of branches; these will defy our rifle bullets, and\r\nunfortunately we have no shells left to fire them.  Gradually these\r\nheaps will be advanced, and under cover of them they will make their\r\nnext and, I fear, final attack, and it will be made by day.\"\r\n\r\nHalcott was right, and in a few days' time the savages were within a\r\nhundred yards of the palisade.  They no doubt meant to advance as near\r\nto it as possible during the hours of darkness, and with might and main\r\nattack at sunrise.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when the movement on the part of the besiegers began,\r\nand the cover was then slowly advanced.  A gentle breeze had begun to\r\nblow away from the camp, and the night was moonless and dark.\r\n\r\nPresently a hand was laid on Halcott's shoulder.  He had been lying near\r\nthe outer stockade quietly talking with James; while Tandy was in the\r\nship's state-room keeping his little girl company.  The poor child was\r\nsadly uneasy to-night, and the father was trying his best to comfort\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"What! you here, Lord Fitzmantle?\" said Halcott.\r\n\r\n\"I'se heah, sah.\"\r\n\r\nIt was probably well he said so, for excepting his flashing teeth and\r\nrolling eyes, there wasn't much else of him to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"And you're pretty nearly naked, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'se neahly altogedder naked, sah.  I'se got noddings much on, sah, but\r\nmy skin.  I go on one 'spedition [expedition] all same's Dabid of old go\r\nout to meet de giant Goliah.  Dabid hab sling and stone though; Fitz hab\r\nno sling, on'y one box ob matches.  You open dat gate, sah, and I go\r\ncrawl, crawl, all same's one snake, and soon makee one big fire to wahm\r\nde hides ob dose black niggahs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brave and generous little fellow!\" cried Halcott, shaking the boy's\r\nhand.  \"But I fear to risk your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You no feah foh me, sah, all I do.  I jes' done gone do foh de sake ob\r\ndat pooh deah chile Babs.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, ge'men.  You soon see big fire, and you heah de niggahs\r\nfizz.  Suppose dey killee me, dey no can kill de soul.  Dis chile findee\r\nhis way to Hebben all the same, plenty quick.\"\r\n\r\nThey let the little lad out.\r\n\r\nWhether the acute ears of the savages had heard the bolts drawn or not\r\nwill never be known.  Certain it is, however, that Fitz was discovered\r\nand wounded.  But wounded as he was, he had the determination to light\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\nThe savages threw themselves at it, and tore at the burning branches,\r\nbut this only helped to scatter the flames about.\r\n\r\nFitz crawled back, just in time to die inside the stockade.\r\n\r\n\"I go to Hebben now,\" he said faintly to James, who was kneeling beside\r\nhim holding his hand.  \"I'se dun my duty I fink--heah below.  I see my\r\npooh old mudder to-night--she--she--\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, and never spoke again.  The noble little fellow had\r\nindeed done his duty, and doubtless would receive his reward.\r\n\r\nJames Malone was like a wild man now.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Halcott,\" he cried, \"summon all hands to arras, and let us\r\nsally forth and give these fiends a lesson.  They have done to death\r\nthis noble little fellow.  Come, Halcott, come.  An eye for an eye, and\r\na tooth for a tooth!\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his sword aloft as he spoke.\r\n\r\nSo sudden and determined was the sally now made by ten resolute men\r\nthat, taken thus unexpectedly, the savages became at once unmanned and\r\ndemoralised.\r\n\r\nThe men of the _Sea Flower_ advanced in a semicircle, and well spread\r\nout.  After the first volley, the blacks threw a few spears wildly into\r\nthe darkness, for the terrible conflagration blinded their eyes; but,\r\nhuddled together as they were, they made an excellent target for the\r\nriflemen.\r\n\r\nVolley after volley was poured into their midst with terrible effect,\r\nincreasing their confusion every minute.\r\n\r\n\"Lay aft here now, lads!\" shouted James.  \"Down with your guns!  Charge\r\nwith cutlass and revolver.  Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nHigh above the demoniacal shrieks of the savages and the roaring of the\r\nflames rose that wild British cheer.  Next moment the revolvers poured\r\nupon the foe a rain of death.\r\n\r\nAgain a cheer.  Sword and cutlass flashed in the firelight.  Right and\r\nleft, left and right, the men struck out, and blood flowed like water.\r\n\r\nTowering above all was James himself, with flashing eyes and red-stained\r\nblade, his long hair streaming behind in the breeze that fanned the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nShort but fearful was that onslaught.  In the eyes of the\r\nterror-stricken savages every man must have seemed a multitude.  And no\r\nwonder.  It was death or victory for the poor Crusoes; and never before\r\ndid soldier on battlefield, or sailor on slippery battle-deck, fight\r\nwith greater fury than they did now.\r\n\r\nBut, lo!  James has seen the king himself, with his golden-headed spear,\r\nwhich he tries in vain to poise, so crushed and crowded is he in the\r\nmidst of his mob of warriors.\r\n\r\n\"It is I,\" shouts James, in the native tongue, \"I, whose blood you would\r\nhave drunk.  Drink it now if you dare!\"\r\n\r\nNothing can withstand him, and soon he has fought his way towards the\r\nchief, and next moment the savage throws up his arms and falls dead\r\nwhere he stands.\r\n\r\nAs if moved now but by a single thought, the enemy, with a howl of\r\nterror, go rushing away and disappear in the darkness.  The victors are\r\nleft alone with the dead!\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the victory has cost them more than one precious life.\r\n\r\nHere, stark and stiff, lies the brave young fellow Sackbut, who had\r\nfired the bush on the first landing of the savages.\r\n\r\nAnd not far off poor Tom Wilson himself.\r\n\r\nAt first they can hardly believe that Tom is dead.  He is raised partly\r\non his elbow, and his eyes are fixed on a portrait he has taken from his\r\nbosom.  Tandy, who found him, had seen that picture before.  It was that\r\nof his wife.\r\n\r\nAh, well, he had sinned, he had suffered, but his sorrows were all past\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAnother man is wounded--honest Chips himself.\r\n\r\nIs this all?  Ah, no, for James himself, as he turns to leave the scene\r\nof carnage, leans suddenly on his sword, his face looks ghastly pale in\r\nthe firelight, and Halcott springs forward only in time to prevent him\r\nfrom falling.\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF JAMES.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the victory was a sad enough one in the camp of the\r\nCrusoes.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was routed, the king was slain.  For a time, at least, there\r\nwould be a cessation of strife.  For how long no one troubled himself to\r\nconsider; sorrow seemed everywhere, on board and in the camp around.\r\n\r\nPoor James lay on a mattress on deck.  Perhaps he was the only man that\r\nsmiled or seemed happy.  _He_ knew, and Halcott knew too, that he could\r\nnot last for many days, so grievously was he wounded.\r\n\r\nHalcott, I need not say, was constant in his attendance on him, and so\r\ntoo was little Nelda.\r\n\r\nThe girl would sit for hours beside him, sometimes reading childish\r\nstories to him, which she felt certain, in her own mind, would help to\r\nmake him better.  Or she would gently pat his weather-beaten face,\r\nsaying, as she did so, \"Poor uncle James! poor dear uncle!  Never mind!\r\nnever mind!\"\r\n\r\nThe dead were tenderly wrapped in hammocks which were heavily loaded.\r\nTheirs would be a sailor's grave.  Halcott himself read the beautiful\r\nwords of the English Church service, the few that were now left of the\r\nbrave crew of the _Sea Flower_ kneeling bareheaded beside the bodies of\r\ntheir late comrades; more than one was weeping.\r\n\r\n  \"We commit their bodies to the deep,\r\n  And their souls to Him who gave them.\"\r\n\r\nTheir shipmates just patted the hammocks, before they let them slide, in\r\na way that was very pathetic; then down, one by one, over the cliff they\r\ndropped--\r\n\r\n  \"To lie where pearls lie deep.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen Halcott returned one day from the cliff-top, some time after this\r\nsad funeral, there was a shade of greater uneasiness than usual on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nJames was quick to note it.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming again?\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed aright,\" said Halcott.  \"And they are using the same\r\ntactics--coming up under cover of brushwood.  There is no Fitz now to\r\nfire the heap, and our strength is terribly reduced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer, Halcott--be of good cheer; it is God Himself who\r\ngiveth the victory.  But death cometh sooner or later to all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" said Halcott; \"and oh, James, I for one am almost tired of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say not so, brother, say not so, 'tis sinful.\"\r\n\r\nHow terrible is war, reader!  The accounts that we read of this scourge,\r\nin papers or in books, seldom show it up in its true colours.  We are\r\ntold only of its glory--its tinsel show of glory.  But that glory is but\r\nthe gilded shell that hides the hideous kernel, consisting of sorrow,\r\nmisery, murder, and rapine.\r\n\r\nI am not poor Tandy's judge, and shall not pretend to say whether the\r\nresolve he now made was right or wrong.\r\n\r\nJust under the saloon was the magazine, and when the worst should come\r\nto the worst, and the savage foe burst through the outer barrier with\r\nyells and howls of victory, his child, he determined, should not be torn\r\nfrom his grasp, to suffer cruelty unspeakable at the hands of the foe.\r\n_He would fire the magazine_!\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said Halcott, a morning or two after this, as he stood\r\ntalking to his garrison of five, \"the enemy is advancing in even greater\r\nforce than on any previous occasion.  I have but little more to say to\r\nyou.  Let us bid each other `good-bye' just before the fight begins, and\r\ndie with our swords in our hands--\r\n\r\n  \"`Like true-born British sailors.'\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe time came at last--and the enemy too.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the brightest days the Crusoes had ever witnessed on this\r\nIsle of Misfortune.  Even from the cliff-top, or over the barricade, the\r\ndistant islands could be seen, like emeralds afloat between sea and sky.\r\nThe volcanic mountain--so clear was the air--appeared almost within\r\ngunshot of the camp.\r\n\r\nFor hours and hours there had not been a sound heard anywhere.  The\r\nmonster pile of brushwood, behind which those dusky, fiendish warriors\r\nhid, had been advanced to within seventy yards of the palisade, but all\r\nwas silence there.  Even the sea-birds had ceased their screaming.  All\r\nnature was ominously hushed; the bare and blackened country around the\r\ncamp lay sweltering in the noon-day heat; and the ensign on Observatory\r\nHill had drooped, till it appeared only as a thin, red line against the\r\nupper end of the pole.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke save in a whisper.\r\n\r\nBut with a little more excitement than usual, Halcott advanced to the\r\nplace where Tandy stood, rifle in hand, his pistols in his belt, waiting\r\nlike the others for the inevitable.\r\n\r\nHalcott did not even speak.  He simply took his friend by the arm and\r\npointed westward.\r\n\r\nA cloud lay like a dark pall on the very summit of Fire Hill.\r\n\r\nTandy knew the meaning of it.  He only shook his head, however.  \"Too\r\nlate, I fear!\"  That was all he said.  But hardly had the last word been\r\nspoken, before a stranger thing than that cloud on the mountain\r\nattracted attention.\r\n\r\nA huge, smooth, house-high billow was seen gradually approaching the bay\r\nfrom seaward.  It gathered strength, and speed too, as it came onwards,\r\nand finally it broke on the beach in one long line of curling foam, and\r\nwith a sound as loud as distant thunder.\r\n\r\nWave after wave succeeded it, though they were neither so high nor so\r\nswift; then silence once more prevailed, and the sea was as quiet and\r\nstill as before.\r\n\r\nNot for long though.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes' time every man's senses seemed to reel, and a giddy,\r\nsickly feeling passed through the brain, such as only those who have\r\nvisited countries like Japan or South America have ever experienced.\r\n\r\nIt was the first shock of an earthquake!\r\n\r\nPeal after peal of strange subterranean thunder accompanied it, and a\r\nkind of hot wave spread suddenly over the island, like a breeze blowing\r\nover a burning prairie.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these manifestations on the enemy was marvellous.  For a\r\nfew moments they were dumb and silent with terror; then yells of fear\r\narose, and they fled indiscriminately away towards the sea beach,\r\nthrowing away bows, arrows, and spears, and even their scanty articles\r\nof apparel, in their headlong, hurried flight.\r\n\r\n\"The fire-fiend!  He comes! he comes!\"\r\n\r\nThat was their cry now, and their only cry.\r\n\r\nIn a marvellously short time they were seen swarming on the beach, and\r\nin all haste dragging down and launching their great war-canoes; and in\r\nless than twenty minutes' time they were, to the immense relief of the\r\nlittle garrison, afloat on the now heaving bosom of the deep.\r\n\r\nWhen Halcott ran on board the hulk, I do not think he knew quite what he\r\nwas doing or saying.  He seemed beside himself with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, live, brother James! live!  Do not die and leave us now that our\r\nsafety is assured.  The savages have fled, they will never return.\r\nLive, brother, live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, live, poor uncle! live!\" cried Nelda; \"live for _my_ sake, dear\r\nuncle!\"\r\n\r\nTandy was the next to rush on board, and his first act was to catch his\r\nlittle daughter up, cover her face with kisses, and press her to his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Halcott,\" he cried at last, \"there is just one more shot in\r\nthe big gun.  Come, let us drag her to the cliff.  If I can sink but a\r\nsingle boat, I shall be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nBut the dying man lifted his hand, and Halcott and Tandy both drew near.\r\n\r\n\"No, brothers, no,\" he murmured.  \"Fire not the gun--the battle is the\r\nLord's.  He alone--hath given us the victory.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the men knelt there, with bent heads, as if ashamed of the deed they\r\nhad been about to commit.\r\n\r\nAh! but the tears were flowing fast from their eyes.  Poor James was\r\ndead!\r\n\r\nBook 3--CHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nLEAVES FROM FIRST MATE TANDY'S LOG.\r\n\r\nLike all the other dead, poor James Malone received the honours of a\r\nsailor's burial on the very next day.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike the rest, he was not slipped over the cliff.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Halcott determined he should rest far out in the blue,\r\nlone sea, where nothing might disturb his rest until \"the crack of\r\ndoom.\"  The last words were those of Halcott himself.\r\n\r\nSo the lightest boat was dragged all the way to the beach, and there,\r\nwith the body sewn up in a hammock and covered with a red flag, it was\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\nThere had been no return of the earthquake, but all the previous night\r\nflames and smoke had issued from Fire Hill, and no one doubted that an\r\neruption on a vast scale was imminent.  There was, however, no danger in\r\nleaving little Nelda and her brother alone in the hulk with Janeira and\r\nChips--who was already able to walk--for the savages were far away,\r\nindeed, by this time.  So Tandy accompanied Halcott, and with them went\r\nthe others--only five in all.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken until the boat was beyond the bay and in very deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Way enough!\" cried Halcott.  \"In oars!\"\r\n\r\nAll sat there with bent, uncovered heads while the captain read the\r\nservice; but his voice was choked with emotion, and when the shotted\r\nhammock took the water with a melancholy boom and disappeared, he closed\r\nthe book.  He could say no more for a time.\r\n\r\nAs a rule seafarers are not orators, though what they do say is\r\ngenerally to the point.\r\n\r\nHalcott sat for fully a minute like one in a trance, gazing silently and\r\nreverently at the spot where the body had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe bubbles had soon ceased to rise, and there was nothing now to mark\r\nthe sailor's cemetery.  Though--\r\n\r\n              \"He was the loved of all,\r\n  Yet none on his low grave might weep.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said Halcott, \"there in peace rests the body of my dearest\r\nfriend, my adopted brother.  I never had a brother save him.  How much I\r\nloved him none can ever know.  The world and the ship will be a deal\r\nmore lonesome to me now that James has gone.  For many and many a long\r\nyear we sailed the seas together, and weathered many a gale and storm.\r\nSound, sound may he sleep, while wind and waves shall sing his dirge.\r\nUnselfish was he to the end, and every inch a sailor.  His last word was\r\n`Victory;' and well may we now add, `O death, where is thy sting?  O\r\ngrave, where is thy victory?'\r\n\r\n\"Out oars, men!  Give way with a will!\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThey reached the shore in safety, and drew up the boat high and dry.\r\nBut none too soon; for, before they got on board once more, a terrible\r\nthunderstorm had come on, with lightning more vivid than any one on the\r\nhulk ever remembered.\r\n\r\nI have Tandy's log before me as I write, and I do not think I can do\r\nbetter than make a few extracts therefrom.\r\n\r\n\"_The lost Barque, Sea Flower_.--On the rocks, in Treachery Bay, Isle of\r\nMisfortune, latitude --, longitude --, August 5, 18--.  Buried poor\r\nJames Malone to-day.  Halcott terribly cut up.  Doesn't seem to be the\r\nsame man.  But we all miss James; he was so gentle, so kind, and true.\r\nWe miss Fitz also.  His merry ways and laughing face made him a\r\nfavourite with us all.  And honest Tom Wilson; we shall never again hear\r\nhis sweet music.  Thank Heaven that, though the thunder is now rolling,\r\nthe lightning flashing, and a rain that looks like mud falling, I have\r\nmy darlings both beside me!  In the darkest hours I have ever spent in\r\nlife, I've always had something to comfort me.  Yes, God is good.\r\n\r\n\"The sun is setting.  I never saw a sun look so lurid and red before.\r\nThe thunder continues, but the rain has ceased.  There are frequent\r\nsmart shocks of earthquake.\r\n\r\n\"_August 8_.--Two awful days and nights have passed, and still we are\r\nall alive.  The days have been days of darkness; the ashes and scoriae\r\nhave been falling constantly, and now lie an inch at least in depth upon\r\nour deck.  Nights lit up by the flames that spout cloud-high from the\r\nvolcano, carrying with them rocks and stones and steam.  There is a\r\nterribly mephitic vapour over everything.  How long this may last Heaven\r\nalone can tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 12_.--Four more fearful days.  The eruption continues with\r\nunabated horror--the thunderings, the lightnings, the showers of stones\r\nand ashes, and the rolling clouds of dust through which, even at midday,\r\nthe sun glares like a ball of crimson fire.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Chips is dead; we buried him yesterday.  More of us are ill.\r\nHalcott himself is depressed, and my wee Nelda cares for nothing save\r\nlying languidly on the sofa all day long.  The thought that she may die\r\nhaunts me night and day.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 13_.--Almost at the last of our provisions.  The biscuit is\r\nfinished; the very dust has been scraped up and eaten.  Not more than a\r\nscore of tins of _soupe en bouille_ left in the ship, and about one\r\ngallon of rum.  Served out to-day what remained of the salmon, and gave\r\ndouble allowance of rum to-night.\r\n\r\n\"Not a green thing seems to be left on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 15_.--Feel languid and weary.  Went to prayers to-day.  All our\r\nhopes must now centre in the life to come; we have none for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 18_.--The strange crane lies trussed in a corner of the saloon.\r\nWe force him to eat a little, and Bob sits near him and licks his face.\r\n\r\n\"To-day Bob went off by himself.  He was away for hours, and we thought\r\nwe should never see him again; but in the afternoon he returned, driving\r\nbefore him five little black pigs.  Thin and miserable are they, but a\r\ngodsend nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"Lava pouring down the hill-side all night long, shimmering green, red,\r\nand orange through the sulphurous haze.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 20_.--Men more cheerful to-day.  The clouds have cleared away,\r\nand we can see the sea, and the sun is less red.\r\n\r\n\"Halcott and I climbed Observatory Hill.  What a scene!  The once\r\nbeautiful island is burnt as it were to a cinder.  Trees are scorched;\r\nall, all is dead.  We could not bear to look at it.  But we cut down the\r\nflag-pole, and brought away the ensign.  They are useless now.\r\n\r\n\"Who will be the next to die?  `O Father,' I cry in my agony, `spare my\r\nlife while my little one lives, that I may minister to her till the\r\nlast!  Then take my boy and me!'\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 22_.--Four bells in the middle-watch.  I awoke an hour ago with\r\na start.  Halcott, too, had rushed into the saloon.\r\n\r\n\"`Did you hear it?' he cried wildly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I had heard.\r\n\r\n\"The unusual sound awoke us all--the sound of a ship blowing off steam\r\nin the bay yonder, far beneath us.  The sound of anchor chains rattling\r\nout, the sound of voices--the voices of brave British sailors!\r\n\r\n\"`Halcott!  Halcott!'  I cried; `we are saved!'\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I have been weeping.  Nelda is on my knee at this moment while\r\nI write, her cheek pressed close to mine.  Oh, how good God has been to\r\nme!  We have fired off guns, and raised our voices in a feeble cheer,\r\nand the people have replied.\r\n\r\n\"It is no dream then.\r\n\r\n\"Surely I am not mad!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, will the morning never come? and will the sun never shine again?\r\nI--\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe log breaks off abruptly just here, and all that I have further to\r\nsay was gleaned from Halcott and Tandy themselves.\r\n\r\nThe steamer, then, that had arrived so opportunely to save the few\r\nunhappy survivors of the lost _Sea Flower_ was the trader _Borneo_.  The\r\nvery first to welcome them when they went on board at early dawn was\r\nhonest Weathereye himself.  He had a hand for Halcott and a hand for\r\nTandy--a heart for both.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you!\" he hastened to say.  \"Ah! do not tell me your sad story\r\nnow--no, never a bit of it.  The _Dun Avon_ brought your letters, and I\r\ncould not rest till I came out.\r\n\r\n\"But run below, Halcott; some one else wants to welcome you.  You'll be\r\nsurprised--\"\r\n\r\nHalcott never knew rightly whether he had descended to the saloon on\r\nwings or on his feet, or whether he had jumped right down through the\r\nskylight.\r\n\r\nA minute afterwards, however, Doris was weeping in his arms--ah! such\r\nglad, glad tears--and Doris's mother arose from a couch with a happy\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat same day, after taking all that was valuable out of the dear old\r\n_Sea Flower_--and that _all_ included a fortune in gold--the hull was\r\nset on fire.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the steamer left the island, but not before Tandy and\r\nHalcott had taken the bearings of the hidden mine.\r\n\r\nIn that cave lies an immense fortune for some one some day.\r\n\r\nSome hard work and digging will be required, however, before the fortune\r\nis finally brought to bank, and those who go to seek it must go fully\r\nprepared to fight as fiendish a tribe of man-eating savages as ever yet\r\nhas been faced in the South Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIdeal voyages by sea are still to be made, although not in torpedo-boats\r\nor in _Majesties_, and this was one of them.\r\n\r\nThe Crusoes of the Island of Gold, once fairly afloat on the briny\r\nocean, soon waxed healthy and strong again, and all hands on board the\r\nsaucy _Borneo_ were just as happy as happy could be.\r\n\r\nI must admit, however, that \"saucy _Borneo_\" is simply a figure of\r\nspeech.  There wasn't, really, a trace of sauciness about the dear, old\r\nrumble-tumble of a ship.  The skipper was about as rough as they make\r\nthem; so was his mate--and so were all hands, for that matter.  _But_ if\r\nthey were rough, they were _right_, and just as Dibdin describes a\r\nseaman:--\r\n\r\n  \"Though careless and headstrong if danger should press,\r\n      And ranked 'mongst the free list of rovers,\r\n  He'll melt into tears at a tale of distress,\r\n      And prove the most constant of lovers.\r\n\r\n  \"To rancour unknown, to no passion a slave,\r\n      Nor unmanly, nor mean, nor a railer,\r\n  He's gentle as mercy, as fortitude brave--\r\n      And this is a true British sailor.\"\r\n\r\nAs before, Bob and Nelda were the pets of the ship; and 'Rallie, who now\r\ndid the drollest antics any bird ever attempted, kept all hands laughing\r\nfrom binnacle to bowsprit.\r\n\r\nHappiness is catching.  I gather this from the fact that, after watching\r\nHalcott and Doris walking arm-in-arm up and down the quarterdeck one\r\nlovely day, with pleasure and love beaming in the eyes of each, bold\r\nCaptain Weathereye said to himself,--\r\n\r\n\"How jolly they look!  He makes _her_ happy, and she makes _him_.  Blame\r\nme if I don't make somebody happy myself as soon's I get to port.  I'm\r\nnot so old yet, and neither is Miss Scragley.  Ahem!\"\r\n\r\nWell, the reader can guess how it turned out.  Many years have passed\r\nsince the voyage home of the old _Borneo_.  Doris is Mrs Halcott now.\r\nA pleasant home they have, and Tandy often visits there.\r\n\r\nTandy built himself a beautiful house on the very spot where the humble\r\ncottage stood; but it isn't called Hangman's Hall.  Bob is there, and\r\nMurrams is there--good Mrs Farrow kept him while our heroes were at\r\nsea; and little Nelda--not so little now--is there, too; while, high and\r\ndry, in the gibbet-tree still roosts the droll old Admiral.\r\n\r\nRansey Tansey is a man now, and walks his own quarterdeck; but I did\r\nhear, only yesterday, that he will soon marry Eedie.  There is no Miss\r\nScragley any longer, however.  But there is a Mrs Weathereye.  Ahem!\r\n\r\nYes; and Weathereye and Tandy are almost inseparables, and many a yarn\r\nthey spin together over their pipes.\r\n\r\nAs the canal yonder, with the sunlight glinting on its breast, goes\r\ncalmly meandering through the woods and meadows green, so gently pass\r\ntheir lives along.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, lads!  Please, may I come again?\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe End.",
