In this\r\ncountry practically nothing was done until 1872 when the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature instructed the State Board of Health to investigate and\r\nreport on the subjects of sewerage, sewage disposal, and the pollution\r\nof streams, and to-day Massachusetts leads in the investigation of the\r\nbest methods of sewage disposal.\r\n\r\nSix different methods for the treatment of sewage are now in use. These\r\nmethods are used separately or in combination, the choice depending upon\r\nlocal conditions and the amount of purification required:—\r\n\r\nThese methods are:\r\n\r\n  1— Dilution.\r\n\r\n  2— Irrigation.\r\n\r\n  3— Intermittent Downward Filtration.\r\n\r\n  4— Chemical Precipitation.\r\n\r\n  5— Septic Tank.\r\n\r\n  6— Contact Bed.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this thesis is to investigate each method and make a\r\ncomparison along the following lines:\r\n\r\n  1— Purification.\r\n\r\n  2— Capacity.\r\n\r\n  3— Applicability.\r\n\r\n  4— Cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Dilution_\r\n\r\n\r\nDisposal of sewage by dilution is the most common method at the present\r\ntime, and no doubt will continue to be for some time to come where the\r\nstream or body of water is not used for domestic purposes. Under certain\r\nconditions this affords a satisfactory solution of the problem. However,\r\nif the water into which the sewage is discharged is a source of water\r\nsupply, two very important questions arise. They are: 1—How large must\r\nthe dilution be? 2—How far must the polluted stream flow before the\r\nwater way may be used with safety to public health?\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Dr. Letheby and others in England made the statement that if\r\nsewage is diluted at least twenty times its volume, it will not only be\r\nmade inoffensive but be thoroughly destroyed after flowing a dozen miles\r\nor more.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission of Great Britain in 1878 maintained that\r\nno river in England was long enough to allow of a complete disappearance\r\nof sewage matter discharged into it.\r\n\r\nMr. F. P. Stearns in an article on The Pollution and Self-Purification\r\nof Streams in the Massachusetts State Board of Health Report 1890 gives\r\na table showing, “The calculated composition of sewage for different\r\ndegrees of dilution in a running stream”. A comparison was made of the\r\nBlackstone and Merrimack rivers, and extended over three years. It was\r\nfrom this investigation that the Commissioner of the City of Chicago\r\nreported that the flow of the Chicago Drainage Canal should be four\r\ncubic feet per second per 1000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe purification by dilution may be due to three things:\r\n\r\n  1— Oxidation of organic matter.\r\n\r\n  2— Subsidence.\r\n\r\n  3— Destruction of the organic matter by small animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation is a very slow process and depends mainly upon bacterial\r\nlife and conditions favorable to it. Subsidence depends upon the\r\ndifference in the specific gravity of the suspended matter, and the\r\nclarification is increased as the velocity is diminished.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the destruction of the organic matter by small animals and\r\nplants Dr. Sorby says, (_Journal Royal Microscopic Society, 1884 p.\r\n988_.) “It appears to me that the removal of impurities from rivers is\r\nmore of a biolytic than a chemical question, and it is most important to\r\nconsider the action of minute animals and plants, which may be looked\r\nupon as being indirectly most powerful agents.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Irrigation_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the method of broad irrigation has been carried on successfully\r\nin several of the largest cities of the old world, it has not been used\r\nto any great extent in the United States, except at a few state\r\ninstitutions in the east, and in the arid districts of the west.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago this method of disposal was given much attention as it\r\nwas thought the sewage if used would yield large profits, but more\r\nrecent information shows conclusively that such is not the case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noticeable examples of this system that are now in\r\noperation in the United States are the plants at the State Hospital of\r\nthe Insane, Worcester, Mass., at the Rhode Island State Institute, and\r\nat the Reformatory at Concord, Mass. In all cases the labor was done by\r\nthe inmates so that it is not possible to get a fair statement of the\r\ncost. General information regarding the use of sewage for irrigation in\r\nthe west may be obtained from Baker and Rafters’ “Sewage Disposal in the\r\nUnited States”.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best example of sewage farming is at Berlin. The\r\nfollowing summary is given by James H. Fuentes, M. Am. Soc. C. E., in\r\nNo. 2. Vol. 40 of the Engineering Record. The average quantity of sewage\r\npumped to the farms and distributed amounts to from 6,000,000 to\r\n7,000,000 gallons per acre per year, or in other words each acre serves\r\nfor 750 people. The area farmed is divided into small beds about 150 by\r\n200 feet separated from each other by slight embankments and ditches for\r\ndistributing the sewage over the surface. The sewage is admitted into\r\nthe carriers from the force mains through checking chambers made of\r\nwoven willow and posts driven into the sand.\r\n\r\nThe farms are said to yield small profits over the expenses of working\r\nthem, consequently contribute scarcely anything toward the cost of\r\npumping the sewage.\r\n\r\nThe great reason why this method of disposal has been possible and\r\nprofitable in a degree at Berlin is that this large and beautiful city\r\nlies in the midst of an extensive sandy area, the greater part of which\r\nin the immediate neighborhood is quite sterile and therefore\r\ncomparatively thinly populated. Better conditions for such sewage farms\r\ncould not exist.\r\n\r\nStatistics compiled by Chas. S. Swan, M. Am. Soc. C. E. in his paper,\r\nNotes on European Practice in Sewage Disposal, in Jour. Assn. of Eng.\r\nSoc. Vol. 7 No. 7 shows the volume of sewage per acre per day (yearly\r\naverage) to vary from 2155 to 29450 gallons, and the average depth per\r\nannum varies from 2.4 to 32.8 feet.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth annual report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health\r\n1888 states that on an ordinary farm in Massachusetts 2500 gallons per\r\nacre per day are as much as could be applied to any valuable grass crop.\r\nThis would require such a large area for large cities that irrigation\r\ncould not be depended upon for preventing the pollution of streams.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above report that the irrigation system can be\r\nused to advantage only where large tracts of low land can be obtained at\r\na low cost, and where help and plenty of cheap labor can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Intermittent Downward Filtration_\r\n\r\n\r\nFiltration means the concentration of sewage on an area of especially\r\nchosen porous ground, or on an especially prepared bed as small as will\r\nabsorb and purify it. The intermittency of application is a necessary\r\nrequirement even in suitably constituted soils wherever complete success\r\nis arrived at. The reason for this is that free oxygen is indispensable\r\nto nitrification and the nitrifying organism.\r\n\r\nThis method has been in operation only during the last thirty years, and\r\nthe correct theory of its action has been found out within the last ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDr. Frankland, in the first report of Rivers Pollution Commission of\r\nEngland, shows that not only a chemical action but also a biolytic\r\naction takes place with the assistance of minerals and the oxygen of the\r\nair. This biolytic action is known as nitrification, and consists in the\r\noxidation of the nitrogen of ammonia and its ultimate conversion into\r\nnitric acid. This change takes place in two stages, each characterized\r\nby a distinct organism. The office of one of these organisms is to\r\nconvert ammonia into nitrite, while the other converts nitrites into\r\nnitrate.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria are present or quickly develop in the sewage which may be\r\nconsidered a nutrient medium for them by reason of containing a large\r\namount of their natural nitrogenous food.\r\n\r\nThese organisms, according to Warrington, may be separated by successive\r\ncultivations in favorable media; from a potassium nitrate solution with\r\nno ammonia we may obtain nitric organism alone; from an ammonium\r\ncarbonate solution we may obtain nitrous organisms in a pure state.\r\n\r\nIt is a noticeable fact that frost checks nitrification, but several\r\nsatisfactory methods have been used so that no serious objection can be\r\nraised to intermittent filtration on this ground.\r\n\r\n“The purification of sewage by this method depends upon the oxygen and\r\nthe time of action” (Hazen). To obtain the highest efficiency the sewage\r\nmust be applied intermittently and there must be a large percentage of\r\nvoids in the sand.\r\n\r\nExperiments made on especially prepared beds at Lawrence, Mass. show\r\nthat by treating 85000 gallons per acre per day, 94 percent of the\r\norganic matter and 98 percent of the bacteria are removed, and by\r\ntreating 60,000 gallons per acre per day, 97 to 99 percent of the\r\norganic matter may be removed. The above data shows that 100,000 may be\r\nsuccessfully treated with a five foot bed of sand.\r\n\r\nThe writers inspected the intermittent downward filtration plant at\r\nMendota Illinois and the following data were obtained. The city has a\r\npopulation of about 6000 with 8 miles of sewers and 210 house\r\nconnections. The average daily flow is about 350,000 gallons although\r\nduring the rainy season there is a considerable amount of ground water\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe disposal plant was constructed under the supervision of the Iowa\r\nEngineering Company of Clinton, Iowa, on a 15 acre tract of land, one\r\nand a half miles south of the city. Although original plans called for\r\n18 beds with five feet of gravel, only four beds each 275 feet by 75\r\nfeet were finished, and instead of 5 feet of ground only 24 inches was\r\nused. The plant was complete in July 1899 and was operated until\r\nDecember, when it was discontinued on account of cold weather, it not\r\nbeing considered necessary to operate it during the winter. From\r\nDecember until April the sewage was discharged directly into a creek\r\nwhich runs along one side of the land.\r\n\r\nThe beds have no automatic device for distributing the sewage at\r\ndefinite intervals of time, but are connected with the main sewer by a\r\nnumber of gate valves which were regulated by the attendant. The sewage\r\nis distributed by means of a wooden sluice way which extended the entire\r\nlength of the bed and has six inch openings on the side every 16 feet\r\nwhich gave a fairly even distribution.\r\n\r\nAlthough no analysis of the sand and gravel was made, it was apparent\r\nthat the uniformity coefficient was very large.\r\n\r\nThe material was shipped a distance of 90 miles and resembles ordinary\r\nballast used for rail roads. The largest pieces were thrown along the\r\nsluice way to prevent excessive washing. The finest of the sand was of a\r\nsize which would be considered too fine for good mortar sand. No attempt\r\nwas made to screen the material. The gravel would not be considered\r\nfirst class for filtering beds.\r\n\r\nSamples of the sewage and effluent were taken at two different times.\r\nThe first was between 9:00 and 10:30 A. M., April 20, 1900. Until the\r\nday before no sewage had been applied to the beds since last fall. The\r\nsecond collection was made two weeks later, when samples of the sewage\r\nand effluent were collected at intervals of one hour during the day, and\r\nmixed into composite samples. The sewage was taken from a manhole just\r\nabove the beds, and the effluent from the outlet of the underdrain about\r\n900 feet below the beds.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is given in Table I. and the results show that the beds are\r\nnot working as efficiently as might be expected from a first class\r\nplant. This may be accounted for from the fact that the filtration is\r\ntoo rapid and that the material which is less than two feet in depth is\r\nnot suitable for such a purpose.\r\n\r\n                                    TABLE I.\r\n\r\n Analyses of Sewage and of Effluent from Intermittent Downward Filtration Plant\r\n                               at Mendota, Ills.\r\n\r\n                              Parts per 1,000,000\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n ¦                      ¦      April 20, 1900      ¦       May 4, 1900        ¦\r\n +----------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------¦\r\n ¦                      ¦Sewage¦Effluent¦Efficiency¦Sewage¦Effluent¦Efficiency¦\r\n +----------------------+------+--------+----------+------+--------+----------¦\r\n ¦Oxygen consumed:      ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  Total               ¦ 48.5 ¦  6.50  ¦   86%    ¦ 27.7 ¦  12.0  ¦   55%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦ 33.4 ¦        ¦          ¦ 15.5 ¦  4.6   ¦   70%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 15.1 ¦        ¦          ¦ 12.2 ¦  7.4   ¦   40%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as albuminoid¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  ammonia             ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦         Total        ¦ 10.4 ¦  .32   ¦   97%    ¦ 3.68 ¦  .768  ¦   79%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦ 9.28 ¦        ¦          ¦2.816 ¦  .416  ¦   85%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 1.12 ¦        ¦          ¦ .864 ¦  .352  ¦   59%    ¦\r\n ¦Total organic nitrogen¦17.960¦  .920  ¦   95%    ¦ 9.60 ¦ 1.860  ¦   81%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦15.04 ¦        ¦          ¦7.500 ¦ 1.152  ¦   85%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 2.92 ¦        ¦          ¦2.100 ¦  .708  ¦   66%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as free      ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  ammonia             ¦ 7.20 ¦  2.40  ¦   67%    ¦ 3.84 ¦  1.28  ¦   67%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as nitrites  ¦ .675 ¦  .375  ¦          ¦ 000  ¦  000   ¦          ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as nitrates  ¦ 4.00 ¦ 18.00  ¦          ¦ .120 ¦  .120  ¦          ¦\r\n ¦Chlorine as chlorides ¦ 53.0 ¦  49.0  ¦          ¦ 47.0 ¦  44.0  ¦          ¦\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Chemical Precipitation_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen certain chemicals are added to sewage a precipitate is formed which\r\nunder favorable conditions may carry down with it all the suspended\r\nmatter as well as a portion of the dissolved organic matter. The\r\naddition of the chemicals together with the working of the various\r\nappliances for grinding and mixing the same, the decanting of the\r\neffluent, and the caring for the sludge all constitute what is known as\r\nthe chemical treatment of sewage, the complete process being in reality\r\npartly chemical and partly mechanical.\r\n\r\nThe following matter concerning the theory of precipitation is taken\r\nfrom Baker and Rafter’s Sewage Disposal.\r\n\r\nThe reagents chiefly used at the present time are lime, sulphate of\r\nalumina, and ferrous sulphate. In the case of lime, there is a\r\ncombination of some of the lime and with free and partially combined\r\ncarbon dioxide to form an insoluble carbonate of lime. There is probably\r\na further combination of an additional part of the lime with a portion\r\nof the organic matter in solution. The insoluble substances so formed\r\nsink to the bottom, carrying with them the major portion of the\r\nsuspended matter in the sewage in the form of sludge.\r\n\r\nSulphate of alumina exercises a precipitating effort by a combination of\r\nthe sulphuric acid with lime while alumina hydrate forms a flocculent\r\nprecipitate which entangles and carries down the suspended organic\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 1899 the writers visited the chemical precipitation\r\nplant at Madison Wisconsin and through the kindness of Mr. McClellen\r\nDodge, City Engineer, were shown the plant at that time in operation.\r\n\r\nThe sewage was screened as it came from the city and emptied into a\r\nwell. Here it was dosed with lime and then pumped to one of the four\r\nsettling tanks. These are 15 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter. The\r\nsewage enters near the bottom of the tanks. The sludge settles to the\r\nbottom and the effluent rises to the top, where it is carried away to\r\nthree of the filter beds. These three beds are in continuous use. A\r\nfourth bed is out of use while it is washed and allowed to rest for one\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe total area of the beds is 5550 square feet. The flow through the\r\nbeds is about 8,000,000 gallons per acre per day.\r\n\r\nThe company that constructed and operated the plant agreed that the\r\neffluent on analysis should be found to be equal to the waters of Lake\r\nMendota and the analyses of Lake Mendota water which was adapted as a\r\nstandard of purity is reproduced in the Engineering News Vol. 42 No. 26\r\np. 414. Samples of the crude sewage tank effluent and filter effluent\r\nwere taken and analyzed as shown in Table II. A comparison of this table\r\nwith the standard shows that in no particulars does the effluent from\r\nthe plant come up to the standard.\r\n\r\nThe company has since abandoned the contract and the city is considering\r\nother methods of disposal and purification “in order that there may be\r\nno more fiascos in civil engineering at the seat of this well known\r\nschool.” (University of Wisconsin)\r\n\r\n                                   TABLE II.\r\n\r\n  Analyses of Sewage and Effluent from Chemical Precipitation Plant and Filter\r\n                             Beds at Madison, Wis.\r\n\r\n                              Parts per 1,000,000.\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n ¦                      ¦                  November 23, 1900                  ¦\r\n +----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------¦\r\n ¦                      ¦  Chemical Precipitation  ¦       Filter-beds        ¦\r\n +----------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------¦\r\n ¦                      ¦Sewage¦Effluent¦Efficiency¦Sewage¦Effluent¦Efficiency¦\r\n +----------------------+------+--------+----------+------+--------+----------¦\r\n ¦Oxygen consumed:      ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  Total               ¦ 38.3 ¦  23.2  ¦   40%    ¦ 23.2 ¦  14.3  ¦   38%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦ 27.2 ¦  12.1  ¦   55%    ¦ 12.1 ¦  3.5   ¦   71%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 11.1 ¦  11.1  ¦   00%    ¦ 11.1 ¦  10.8  ¦    3%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as albuminoid¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  ammonia             ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦         Total        ¦ 8.32 ¦  4.00  ¦   52%    ¦ 4.00 ¦  2.46  ¦   38%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦ 7.12 ¦  2.56  ¦   64%    ¦ 2.56 ¦  1.60  ¦   37%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 1.20 ¦  1.44  ¦   –20%   ¦ 1.44 ¦  .864  ¦   40%    ¦\r\n ¦Total organic nitrogen¦15.30 ¦  5.32  ¦   67%    ¦ 5.32 ¦  3.56  ¦   33%    ¦\r\n ¦         In suspension¦12.48 ¦  1.86  ¦   85%    ¦ 1.86 ¦  1.54  ¦   17%    ¦\r\n ¦         In solution  ¦ 2.82 ¦  3.46  ¦   –23%   ¦ 3.46 ¦  2.02  ¦   42%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as free      ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦  ammonia             ¦ 32.0 ¦  32.0  ¦    0%    ¦ 32.0 ¦  32.0  ¦    0%    ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as nitrites  ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦      ¦        ¦          ¦\r\n ¦Nitrogen as nitrates  ¦ .120 ¦  .240  ¦          ¦0.240 ¦  0.60  ¦          ¦\r\n ¦Chlorine as chlorides ¦ 134  ¦  136   ¦          ¦ 136  ¦  119   ¦          ¦\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nAnother example of the use of chemical precipitation is at Alliance,\r\nOhio. There are three tanks each with a capacity of 144000 gallons. The\r\namount of sewage flowing into the tanks during the year 1897 averaged\r\nabout 300,000 gallons per day. During the year 1897 each day 180 pounds\r\nof chemicals were added to the sewage and 650 pounds of sludge was\r\nprecipitated and pressed daily.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the disposal plant was $20755.00. The cost of\r\noperation and maintenance for the years 1897 and 1898 was $1290.00 and\r\n$1567.43 respectively. The average amount of lime used during this time\r\nwas 95000 pounds yearly.\r\n\r\nTwo men perform all the labor necessary for the operation of the plant.\r\n\r\nFrom the chemical analyses given in the Engineering Record Jan. 13, 1900\r\nof the sewage and effluent, averages representing five months show the\r\nefficiency in albuminoid ammonia to be 40 percent and oxygen required 30\r\npercent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Septic Tank_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss a very different process of treating sewage, the\r\nseptic method. The septic tank consists of a tank from which generally\r\nthe air and light are excluded and through which the sewage flows with a\r\nslow velocity, thus allowing the matter in suspension to settle to the\r\nbottom or rise to the top by reason of its specific gravity, there to be\r\nfurther acted upon or decomposed by bacteria. The currents should be so\r\nguided that they are distributed over a considerable depth and not\r\nallowed to disturb the sediments at the bottom or the material at the\r\ntop. The darkened ill ventilated and modestly heated conditions in the\r\ntank are all conducive to the propagation of a micro-organism known as\r\nbacteria. The activity of these organisms causes a chemical\r\ndecomposition of the organic matter in the sewage a part passing off as\r\ngas and a part passing off in the effluent as inorganic matter, while\r\nanother portion is deposited in the bottom of the tank as sludge.\r\n\r\nSo far only matter in suspension has been considered but it is also true\r\nthat chemical action takes place to some extent in the organic matter in\r\nsolution. This chemical action is a denitrifying action similar to that\r\nwhich takes place in intermittent downward filtration.\r\n\r\nAn important fact in the septic tank effluent is that its compounds have\r\nbeen broken down and it can now be more readily purified.\r\n\r\nThe septic tank process is self-regulating, self-acting, requires no\r\nattention except the occasional cleaning out of the sludge.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this process the septic tank at Champaign Illinois\r\nmay be described.\r\n\r\nThis tank although designed in 1895, has only been in operation since\r\n1897. The dimensions of this tank are 37 by 16 by 5 feet and it has a\r\ncubic capacity of 22,000 gallons. It has taken care of a dry weather\r\nflow of 300,000 gallons per day, about 13 times its cubic contents. The\r\ntank has operated with a range of from 11 to 27 times its cubic capacity\r\nwith a high efficiency of purification though much of this was ground\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the organic matter in suspension, as shown by the\r\nreduction of oxygen consumed, nitrogen as albuminoid ammonia, and total\r\norganic nitrogen in three analyses averaged 94 percent. However it is\r\nnot considered that an average of more than 80 to 90 percent may\r\ngenerally be expected. The reduction of organic matter in solution is\r\nconsiderable, averaging 17 percent.\r\n\r\nThis sludge at the bottom is a black muddy looking silt-like deposit\r\ncontaining about 60 percent of water and 5 percent of organic matter.\r\nIts value as a fertilizer is small.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of sludge is relatively small the accumulation\r\nrequires removal occasionally, three or four times a year.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that for every 1,000,000 gallons sewage there is about 3\r\ncubic feet of dry matter. By chemical precipitation this would amount to\r\nfrom 20 to 25 cubic feet per 1,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nAnother good example of the septic tank method is the one in use at\r\nExeter, England.\r\n\r\nThis plant has been in operation since 1896. It was designed for 98000\r\ngallons capacity. The sewage is allowed to remain in the tank nearly 24\r\nhours. The tank is used in conjunction with five beds in which further\r\npurification is used. The beds are filled with coke breeze and one is\r\nalways resting for a week at a time. The tank is made nearly air tight\r\nby an arched roof and any gasses collecting may be burned at a vent.\r\n\r\nThe rate of working this tank is much slower than the process at\r\nChampaign Illinois.\r\n\r\nAt Southwold England, there is another good illustration of this method.\r\nThis has been called an open septic tank and is used in conjunction with\r\ntwo beds, an anaerobic, and an aerobic bed, the latter containing\r\npolarite.\r\n\r\nThis plant is interesting from the fact that the effluent from the\r\nanaerobic bed is distributed over the aerobic bed by means of a\r\nrevolving sprinkler which prevents the liquid from passing unequally\r\nthrough the large grain, porous material. The action upon these beds is\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nFrom a report of this system the analysis of gas found in three samples\r\nare as follows:—\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n ¦             ¦             ¦             ¦   Carbon    ¦Sulphuretted ¦\r\n ¦             ¦   Oxygen    ¦  Nitrogen   ¦   dioxide   ¦  hydrogen   ¦\r\n +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------¦\r\n ¦Septic tank  ¦        0.25%¦       28.46%¦       70.03%¦        1.26%¦\r\n ¦Anaerobic bed¦        7.26%¦       39.10%¦       52.37%¦        0.91%¦\r\n ¦Aerobic bed  ¦       20.62%¦       78.63%¦        0.75%¦        0.00%¦\r\n +---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Contact Bed_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contact bed as distinguished from the bacteria bed may be said to be\r\nmade up of fine material, while the bacteria beds are built of coarse\r\nmaterial. The latter are used for taking out the rougher solids, and the\r\nformer for taking out the more finely divided material, and the organic\r\nmatter in solution. While this distinction is not commonly made it seems\r\nto be growing into usage.\r\n\r\nIn the process of purification by means of contact beds the sewage is\r\napplied intermittently by distributing pipes or troughs so as to slowly\r\nfill the beds which are filled from a depth of from three to six feet\r\nwith any kind of hard, porous, jagged material. The change which takes\r\nplace is due to the action of certain bacteria in the presence of air.\r\nAlthough this process is not a new one, the method by which the results\r\nwere obtained was not fully understood until the more recent discoveries\r\nin the science of bacteriology were made.\r\n\r\nThe beds are made water tight to a depth of about four feet, the bottom\r\nbeing channeled or tiled to drain the effluent either to a secondary bed\r\nor into the effluent channel.\r\n\r\nMany eminent men have advocated special material as coal, coke, clinker\r\nslag, sand, and gravel, and even glass for filling material. The results\r\ndo not differ materially and Prof. L. P. Kennicutt in an article in the\r\nJournal of the Association of Engineering Societies, February 1900 makes\r\nthe following statement, “The material should be more or less porous so\r\nas to have a larger water absorbing area and have a jagged surface on\r\nwhich the gelatinized micro-organisms can be easily retained.”\r\n\r\n“The quantity of sewage that can be successfully treated by intermittent\r\nfiltration has been shown not to be over 100,000 gallons per acre per\r\nday, a quantity so small as to be quite useless for towns and cities\r\nwhich would be obliged to construct beds with sand not “in situ”. This\r\npoint was quickly perceived in England where sand “in situ” is not of\r\ncommon occurrence. These bacteria beds were not used long before the\r\nproblem arose: Can the amount of land required by the intermittent\r\nfiltration method be so reduced that the construction of artificial\r\nbacteria beds will be a practical possibility?\r\n\r\n“The results of the investigation started by this problem have given us\r\nwhat is known as the contact system of treatment and the septic tank\r\ntreatment and have apparently shown not only that by combining these two\r\nmethods the amount of area required for 100,000 gallons can be reduced\r\nfrom one acre to about one seventh of an acre but also that the\r\nbacterial treatment is possible with sewage containing manufacturing\r\nrefuse, and have outlined how sewage containing storm water may be\r\ntreated.”\r\n\r\nIt has been found by experiment that after two or three weeks there is a\r\nmarked reduction in the initial capacity of the tank due to breaking\r\ndown of the filling material and also to the filling material becoming\r\ncharged and coated over with a gelatinous slime consisting of living\r\norganisms and organic matter in the process of transformation.\r\n\r\nIf the bed is not overworked the capacity of the tank will remain\r\nconstant after the first two or three weeks, showing that the durability\r\nis unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe beds are usually filled in half an hour, and the sewage allowed to\r\nremain on them about two hours when the effluent is run off and the beds\r\nallowed to rest several hours before again being filled.\r\n\r\nBy contact beds in series, the number depending upon the kind of sewage,\r\nalmost any degree of purification can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Engineering Record of Jan. 27, 1900 gives a very interesting account\r\nof the sewage disposal works at Sutton, England. The works were\r\nconstructed in 1891–93, and comprise an area of 28 acres, 18 acres only\r\nbeing capable of irrigation. They were originally designed for chemical\r\nprecipitation and broad irrigation, but after giving these methods a two\r\nyears’ trial the local board found itself unable to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the conservators of the River Thames, into which the\r\neffluent flowed.\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. Dibdin advised the construction of filters or fine grained\r\nbacteria beds. Two beds having a combined area of a quarter of an acre\r\nand a capacity of 200,000 gallons, were built in 1895–96 for the\r\npurification of the chemically treated sewage. In 1896 the first\r\nbacteria bed was constructed for the treatment of crude sewage.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, many tests were made to determine the best kind of\r\nmaterial for filling the beds.\r\n\r\nThe crude sewage, after being screened to intercept floating matter, is\r\nrun directly onto the filters without the addition of any chemicals.\r\nAfter remaining in the beds for a period of two hours the effluent is in\r\na fit condition to be discharged into the brook leading to the Thames\r\nand is uniformly superior to the effluent obtainable by local land\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nAll experiments with bacteria beds show that the objects for which they\r\nwere intended, to abolish sludge, has been realized and that sewage can\r\nbe purified without chemicals at a small cost, being but little more\r\nthan that incurred by the labor in attending to, or supervising the\r\nfilling and discharging, the filters, and that sewage purification can\r\nbe carried on with little or no nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Discussion_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of purification to be obtained by dilution depends upon the\r\nsize of the stream into which the sewage is discharged and also upon the\r\namount of oxygen contained in the stream. The latter condition is\r\ncontrolled very largely by the rate of flow of the stream and its\r\nprevious condition of pollution. Mr. E. P. Stearns in his report to the\r\nMassachusetts State Board of Health, 1890, on Pollution and\r\nSelf-Purification of Streams, gave a table showing the calculated amount\r\nof free ammonia, dissolved solids and chlorine which sewage adds to\r\nrunning streams.\r\n\r\nMuch interest is being taken in the effect of the discharge of the\r\nsewage of Chicago, and the waters of Lake Michigan, into the Illinois\r\nRiver, and the outcomes of the analyses of samples taken along the river\r\nis awaited with interest. Published reports have not been given out, but\r\ninformation from the most reliable sources seem to show that a\r\nconsiderable purification takes place in the passage down the river.\r\n\r\nNo reliable data could be obtained giving the percent of purification by\r\nirrigation. At Berlin the sewage is purified by this method, and the\r\neffluent comes well within the requirements of the German law.\r\n\r\nWith chemical treatment about 90 percent of the matter in suspension and\r\na small percent of that in solution is removed, and the purification is\r\nabout 53 percent of the total organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe best examples of intermittent downward filtration show an efficiency\r\nof 95 percent on the total organic matter. However, if this process is\r\nused in connection with other methods the organic matter may be reduced\r\n99 percent and the chemical analyses of the effluent may fill the\r\ndrinking water requirements.\r\n\r\nResults of analyses of sewage and effluent from septic tanks show an\r\nefficiency of from 85 to 90 percent in the organic matter in suspension.\r\nVery little change takes place in the matter in solution.\r\n\r\nThe result of experiments with a single contact bed at Sutton, England,\r\nfrom November 1896 to March 1898 shows a purification of 64 percent; if,\r\nhowever, two beds are used in series, a further purification of 50\r\npercent is obtained or a total purification of 82 percent of the crude\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\nThe capacities of irrigation, and intermittent downward filtration\r\nplants, and contact beds are usually stated in terms of the number of\r\ngallons per acre per day.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE III.\r\n\r\n                       _RATE OF SEWAGE TREATMENT._\r\n\r\n System.

Best authorities\r\nconsider 100,000 gallons per acre per day to be the maximum rate\r\npermissible under the best conditions for the treatment of crude sewage\r\nby the intermittent downward filtration system. With unfavorable\r\nconditions the quantity of sewage should be limited to as low as 20,000\r\ngallons. Wherever too large a dose is applied to the bed the sewage is\r\nnot properly purified and the beds soon become clogged up and unfit for\r\nfurther use.\r\n\r\nWhen the beds are used for secondary purification, 750,000 gallons may\r\nbe treated per acre per day.\r\n\r\nThe results of extensive experiments made at Manchester, England in 1898\r\nand 1899 show that by means of contact beds crude sewage may be treated\r\nat the rate of 500,000 gallons per acre per day. When the beds are used\r\nfor secondary purification, 750,000 gallons may be successfully treated,\r\nand storm water sewage treated at the rate of 2,500,000 gallons per acre\r\nper day.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the chemical precipitation plant at Madison, Wisconsin\r\nis 68 percent of the daily flow, which in 1899 was estimated at 300,000.\r\n\r\nThe company that built the plant agreed that the plant should have a\r\ndaily capacity of 1,200,000 for each and every day in the year. This\r\nshows the estimated capacity of the tank to be 28 percent.\r\n\r\nAt Worcester, one of the best examples of this process is in operation.\r\nThe size of the tanks is equal to 28 percent of the total flow of 17.1\r\nmillion gallons per day of which 10.1 million gallons is the out flow\r\nfrom a comparatively clear pond. If the actual amount of sewage is\r\nconsidered the tanks have a capacity of 65 percent of the total flow.\r\n\r\nRafter and Baker in their discussion of the size of tanks recommends\r\nthat the total capacity should be nearly 50 percent of the average daily\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nThe two typical types of septic tanks are those at Exeter, England and\r\nat Champaign Illinois. The first has a cubic capacity of 93 percent of\r\nthe total daily flow, while the second has a capacity of 7.5 percent of\r\nthe daily flow.\r\n\r\nWhen the capacity of the tank is as small as at Champaign the bacteria\r\ndo not have time to act upon the sewage as they would if the flow was\r\nnot so rapid.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded now by the highest authorities on this subject that the\r\ntank should have a capacity equal to from one fourth to one half of the\r\naverage daily flow.\r\n\r\nConcerning the conditions for which the various processes are\r\napplicable, it may be said that the dilution process is used when\r\nadvantage may be taken of natural resources. This method can be utilized\r\nby most cities situated along rivers or streams large enough to\r\nsufficiently dilute and carry away the sewage, and fulfill sanitary\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the use of dilution the Chicago River may be cited.\r\nThere the uncertain flow of the river was made to pass inward toward the\r\nIllinois River with a speed of 2½ miles per hour and a discharge of\r\n20,000 gallons per minute per 100,000 inhabitants. The Blackstone River\r\nwas used by the cities of Massachusetts until the pollution of the river\r\nbecame unbearable and the state was compelled to pass a law forcing the\r\ncities to purify their sewage.\r\n\r\nBroad irrigation is a method which cannot generally be used on account\r\nof the large amount of land and labor required. This method is\r\nespecially applicable to asylums, alms houses, and reformatories where\r\ncost of labor is small. It is used in the West where the value of all\r\navailable water leads to the application of sewage to crops, and also on\r\naccount of the low stage of western streams during the summer which\r\nrenders sewage discharged into them an unbearable nuisance.\r\n\r\nIntermittent downward filtration may be used where there is a\r\nconsiderable area of sandy soil, and also where a high degree of\r\npurification is necessary.\r\n\r\nChemical precipitation does not require a large area for its operation\r\nand used alone does not give a high degree of purification. Where land\r\nand material for beds is expensive, and partial purification is\r\nsufficient, this system may be used.\r\n\r\nThe septic tank requires a small area. The odors are not offensive and\r\ncannot be noticed 100 feet away. The effluent may be discharged into\r\nsmall streams and soon loses its identity.\r\n\r\nContact beds are used where a high degree of purity is required; if the\r\neffluent is emptied into rivers or sources of water supply. The beds do\r\nnot require a large area and the process may be recommended if suitable\r\nmaterial is at hand.\r\n\r\nThe cost of construction and maintenance of the different systems vary\r\nso largely according to local conditions that a fair estimate is not\r\npossible. As the most striking example of maximum and minimum cost the\r\ndisposal system at Chicago and at Lowell, Massachusetts may be cited.\r\nThe purification in both cases is by dilution, the cost being\r\npractically nothing at Lowell while the Chicago Drainage Canal cost\r\n$33,000,000. It may not be fair to charge this entire cost to the\r\nsewerage system; nevertheless up to date it has been used for no other\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAt Berlin, Germany where broad irrigation is used, the sewage has to be\r\npumped to the farms and involves a considerable cost. Aside from this\r\nthe receipts derived from the sale of farm products are enough to pay\r\nthe running expenses of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe first cost of the intermittent downward filtration plant is\r\nestimated by the writers at $90,000 per million gallons per day of\r\nsewage treated, where the beds are artificial. Where natural beds can be\r\nused the first cost may be reduced to $7,500 per million gallons per\r\nday. The cost of maintenance is about $2.00 per 1,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe average cost for operating a chemical disposal plant is about 58\r\ncents per inhabitant per year, or $16.00 per 1,000,000 gallons treated.\r\nAt Manchester England where broad irrigation and chemical precipitation\r\nare used in combination, the average cost was $63.00 per 1,000,000\r\ngallons treated.\r\n\r\nA septic tank for treating 1,000,000 gallons of sewage per day will cost\r\nless than $10,000 and the cost of maintenance will be about $1.00 per\r\n1,000,000 gallons treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Conclusion_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn selecting a method of sewage disposal, the conditions, surroundings,\r\nand requirements of the city should be carefully studied and analyzed,\r\nand judgment and discretion must be used. A matter of so much importance\r\nto the community should be placed in the hands of men qualified to make\r\na proper solution of the problem. While in general several methods of\r\npurification may be applied to the requirements of the city, usually\r\nlocal conditions and considerations will narrow the choice to two plans\r\nor possibly to a single method.\r\n\r\nThe governing features of the dilution process are so distinct that it\r\nis not usually difficult to determine where this method is applicable,\r\nand likewise, the broad irrigation process has peculiar conditions. In\r\nboth, the plans involve only matters of construction.\r\n\r\nThe other methods have more in common and the determination of their\r\nrelative value is not so easy. As before stated, the recently developed\r\nbiolytic processes promise to displace chemical precipitation. Where a\r\nsuitable deposit of sand or gravel is conveniently located on cheap land\r\nwhich may be made without great expense into filtration areas and the\r\nsewage discharged upon them by gravity, intermittent downward filtration\r\nmay be the most satisfactory, especially if a highly purified effluent\r\nis desired. The item of expense of attendance, and labor of maintenance\r\nmust be considered in connection with the cost of this method. In the\r\nabsence of such favorable conditions and especially where complete\r\npurification is not required the septic tank may be the most suitable.\r\nFor higher purification the combination of the septic tank with filter\r\nbeds, or contact beds run at comparatively high rates, makes a\r\nsatisfactory purification and is applicable to a wide range of\r\nconditions. A bacteria bed may be substituted for the septic tank for\r\nthe roughing process but its applicability in not so general.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be said that if the next ten years gives as much\r\ndevelopment in sewage purification as has the last decade, some of the\r\nprocesses herein outlined will have been discarded and sanitary\r\nengineering will have achieved still greater triumphs.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
