Yet the origin of the\r\nsubstances we know as 'clay,' the processes occurring in its formation\r\nand the causes of some of the most important of its characteristics are\r\nof such a nature that it is remarkable that its use should have become\r\nso extended in the arts and sciences, while we know so little of its\r\nproperties when in a pure state.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages an attempt has been made to state in a simple\r\nform an outline of our present knowledge of the subject and to indicate\r\nthe problems which still lie before us.\r\n\r\nThe experimental solution of these problems is rendered peculiarly\r\ndifficult by the inertness of the materials at ordinary temperatures and\r\nthe ease with which the clay molecule appears to break down into its\r\nconstituent oxides at temperatures approaching red heat or as soon as it\r\nbegins to react with alkaline or basic materials.\r\n\r\nAnother serious difficulty is the highly complex nature of that property\r\nknown as 'plasticity' to which many clays owe their chief value. For\r\nmany years this has been regarded as an elementary property such as\r\nhardness, cohesion or colour, but it is now known to be of so elusive a\r\nnature as almost to defy measurement with any degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness with which the methods of physical chemistry have been\r\napplied to geological and mineralogical problems during recent years has\r\nbeen of very great assistance to the student of clay problems, as will\r\nbe seen on studying some of the works mentioned in the short\r\nbibliography at the end of the present volume. When the principles of\r\nhydrolysis, ionization, mass reaction and reactional velocity have been\r\napplied in still further detail to the study of clays, our knowledge of\r\ntheir natural history will increase even more rapidly than it has done\r\nduring the past few years.\r\n\r\nNo industry exercises so great a fascination over those engaged in it as\r\ndo the various branches of clayworking; no other substance offers so\r\nmany problems of such absorbing interest to the artist, the craftsman,\r\nthe geologist, the chemist and the general student of nature, whilst the\r\ndifferences in legal opinion as to the nature of clay could themselves\r\noccupy a volume far larger than the present one.\r\n\r\n                                                                 A.

The\r\nformations named consist chiefly of other rocks in which the clays form\r\nstrata of variable thickness.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief uses of clay have been recognized since the earliest periods\r\nof civilization; the ancient Assyrian and Egyptian records contain\r\nnumerous references to the employment of clay for the manufacture of\r\nbricks and for fulling or whitening cloth.\r\n\r\nClays are distributed so widely and in many cases are so readily\r\naccessible that their existence and some of their characteristics are\r\nknown in entirely uncivilized regions. The use of certain white clays as\r\na food, or at any rate as a means of staving off hunger, is common among\r\nsome tribes of very primitive peoples. The more important uses of clays\r\nfor building and other purposes are naturally confined to the more\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe term _clay_ (A.S. _cloeg_; Welsh _clai_; Dutch _kley_) although used\r\nin a scientific sense to include a variety of argillaceous earths (Fr.\r\n_argile_ = clay) used in the manufacture of bricks, tiles, pottery and\r\nceramic products (Gr. _keramos_ = potter's earth) generally, is really a\r\nword of popular origin and use. Consequently, it is necessary to bear in\r\nmind, when considering geological or other problems of a scientific\r\nnature, that this term has been incorporated into scientific terminology\r\nand that its use in this connection not infrequently leads to confusion.\r\nIn short, whilst almost every dictionary includes one or more\r\ndefinitions of clay, and most text-books on geology, mineralogy, and\r\nallied sciences either attempt a definition or assume the reader's\r\nknowledge of one, there is no entirely satisfactory limitation in regard\r\nto the substances which may or may not be included under the term.\r\n\r\n_Clay_ is a popular term for a variety of substances of very varied\r\norigins, of great dissimilarity in their composition and in many of\r\ntheir chemical and physical properties, and differing greatly in almost\r\nevery conceivable respect. It is commonly supposed that all clays are\r\nplastic, but some of the purest china clays are almost devoid of this\r\nproperty and some of the most impure earths used for brickmaking possess\r\nit in a striking degree. Shales, on the one hand--whilst clearly a\r\nvariety of clay--are hard and rock-like, requiring to be reduced to\r\npowder and very thoroughly mixed with water before they become plastic;\r\nmany impure surface deposits, on the other hand, are so highly plastic\r\nas to necessitate the addition of other (sandy) materials before they\r\ncan be used for the manufacture of bricks and tiles.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to include in the term clay 'all minerals\r\ncapable of becoming plastic when moistened or mixed with a suitable\r\nquantity of water,' but this definition is so wide as to be almost\r\nimpracticable, and leads to the inclusion of many substances which have\r\nno real connection with clays. The limitation of the use of the word\r\n'clay' to the plastic or potentially plastic materials of any single\r\ngeological epoch is also impracticable, for clays appear to have been\r\ndeposited in almost every geological period, though there is some\r\ndifference of opinion as to the time of the formation of certain clays\r\nknown as _kaolins_.\r\n\r\nClay is not infrequently termed a _mineral_, but this does not apply at\r\nall accurately to the many varieties of earths known as 'common clays,'\r\nwhich, together with the 'boulder clays,' contain many minerals and so\r\ncannot, as a whole, be included under this term.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the legal significance of the term 'mineral'--which has\r\nan important economic bearing on account of minerals being taxed or\r\n'reserved' in some instances where non-minerals (including brick clay)\r\nare exempt--there can be no doubt that, scientifically, clay is _not a\r\nmineral but a rock_. Whatever mineral (if any) may give the chief\r\ncharacteristic property to the clays as a class must be designated by a\r\nspecial title, for the general term 'clay' will not serve for this\r\npurpose. Geologically, the clays are sedimentary rocks, some being\r\nunaltered, whilst others--the slates--are notably metamorphosed and can\r\nseldom be used for the purposes for which clays are employed.\r\n\r\nMost clays may be regarded as a mixture of quartz grains, undecomposed\r\nrock débris and various decomposition products of rocks; if the\r\nlast-named consists chiefly of certain hydrous alumino-silicates, they\r\nmay be termed 'clay substance' (see Chapter VI. The imperfections of\r\nthis statement as a definition are obvious when it is remembered that it\r\nmay include a mixture of fine sand and clay containing only 30 per cent.\r\nof the latter substance.\r\n\r\nIt is, at the present time, quite impossible to construct an accurate\r\ndefinition of the term 'clay.' The most satisfactory hitherto\r\npublished defines 'clay' as 'a solid rock composed mainly of\r\nhydro-alumino-silicates or alumino-silicic acids, but often containing\r\nlarge proportions of other materials; the whole possessing the property\r\nof becoming plastic when treated with water, and of hardening to a\r\nstone-like mass when heated to redness.'\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been written, it will be understood that there is\r\nno such entity as a standard clay, for the varieties are almost endless,\r\nand the differences between them are sometimes so slight as to be\r\nscarcely distinguishable.\r\n\r\nA further consideration of this branch of the subject may, however,\r\nconveniently be deferred to a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThe best-known clays are the surface clays, loams and marls, the shales\r\nand other sub-surface clays, and the pottery and china clays. The values\r\nof these different materials vary enormously, some being almost\r\nworthless whilst others are highly valued.\r\n\r\nThe _surface clays_ are chiefly used for the manufacture of bricks and\r\ntiles (though some are quite unsuitable for this purpose) and form the\r\nsoil employed in agriculture in many districts.\r\n\r\nThe _sub-surface clays_ and _shales_ are harder, and usually require\r\nmechanical treatment before they can be used for brick and terra-cotta\r\nmanufacture, or for the production of refractory and sanitary articles.\r\n\r\nThe _pottery and china clays_ are usually more free from accessory\r\nconstituents, and are regarded as the 'purest' clays on the market,\r\nthough a considerable amount of latitude must be allowed in interpreting\r\nthe term 'pure.' China clays are by no means pure in the state in which\r\nthey occur, and require careful treatment before they can be sold.\r\n\r\nFurther information with regard to the characteristics of certain clays\r\nwill be found in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Properties of Clay.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of all clays are alumina and silica, the latter\r\nbeing always in excess of the former. These two oxides are, apparently,\r\ncombined to form a hydro-alumino-silicate or alumino-silicic acid\r\ncorresponding to the formula H4Al2Si2O9[1], but many clays\r\ncontain a much larger proportion of silica than is required to form this\r\ncompound, and other alumino-silicates also occur in them in varying\r\nproportions (see Chapters V and VI).\r\n\r\nAll clays may, apparently, be regarded as consisting of a mixture of one\r\nor more hydrous alumino-silicates with free silica and other non-plastic\r\nminerals or rock granules, and their chemical properties are largely\r\ndependent on the nature and proportion of these accessory ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe purest forms of clay (china clays and ball clays) approximate to the\r\nformula above-mentioned, but others differ widely from it, as will be\r\nseen from the analyses on p. 16. The chemical properties of pure clay\r\nare described more fully in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This formula is commonly written Al2O33·2SiO2·2H2O,\r\nbut although this is a convenient arrangement, it must not be understood\r\nto mean that clays contain water in a state of combination similar to\r\nthat in such substances as washing soda--Na2CO3·24H2O, or zinc\r\nsulphate crystals--ZnSO4·7H2O (see Chapter VI).]\r\n\r\nTaking china clay, which has been carefully purified by levigation, as\r\nrepresentative of the composition of a 'pure' clay, it will be found\r\nthat the chief impurities in clays are (_a_) stones, gravel and\r\nsand--removable by washing or sifting; (_b_) felspar, mica and other\r\nsilicates and free silica--which cannot be completely removed without\r\naffecting the clay and (_c_) lime, magnesia, iron, potash and soda\r\ncompounds, together with minute quantities of other oxides, all of which\r\nappear to be so closely connected with the clay as to be incapable of\r\nremoval from it by any mechanical methods of purification.\r\n\r\nTo give a detailed description of the effect of each of the impurities\r\njust referred to would necessitate a much larger volume than the\r\npresent, but a few brief notes on the more important ones are essential\r\nto a further consideration of the natural history of clay.\r\n\r\n_Stones_, _gravel_ and _sand_ are most noticeable in the boulder clays,\r\nbut they occur in clays of most geological ages, though in very varying\r\nproportions. Sometimes the stones are so large that they may be readily\r\npicked out by hand; in any case the stones, gravel and most of the sand\r\nmay be removed by mixing the material with a sufficient quantity of\r\nwater and passing the 'slip' through a fine sieve, or by allowing it to\r\nremain stationary for a few moments and then allowing the supernatant\r\nliquid to run off into a settling tank. Some clays contain sand grains\r\nwhich are so fine that they cannot be removed in this manner and the\r\nclay must then be washed out by a stream of water with a velocity not\r\nexceeding 2 ft. per hour. Even then, the clay so removed may be found to\r\ncontain minute grains of silt, much of which may be removed by a series\r\nof sedimentations for various periods, though a material perfectly free\r\nfrom non-plastic granules may be unattainable.\r\n\r\nMost of the sand found associated with clays is in the form of fragments\r\nof _quartz_ crystals (fig. 1), though it may be composed of irregular\r\nparticles of other minerals or of amorphous silica.\r\n\r\n_Felspar_, _mica_ and other adventitious silicates occur in many natural\r\nclays in so fine a state of division that their removal would be\r\nunremunerative. In addition to this they act as fluxes when the clays\r\nare heated in kilns, binding the less fusible particles together and\r\nforming a far stronger mass than would otherwise be produced.\r\nConsequently, they are valuable constituents in clays used for the\r\nmanufacture of articles in which strength or imperviousness is\r\nimportant. If these minerals are present in the form of particles which\r\nare sufficiently large to be removed by elutriation in the manner\r\ndescribed on the previous page, the purification of the clay is not\r\ndifficult. Usually, however, the most careful treatment fails to remove\r\nall these minerals; their presence may then be detected by\r\nmicroscopical examination and by chemical analysis. For most of the\r\npurposes for which clays are used, small proportions of these silicates\r\nare unimportant, but where clays of a highly refractory nature are\r\nrequired; and for most of the purposes for which china clays (kaolins)\r\nare employed, they must not be present to the extent of more than 5 per\r\ncent., smaller proportions being preferable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Quartz crystals, natural size. (From Miers'\r\nMineralogy _by permission of Macmillan & Co._)]\r\n\r\n_Oxides_, _sulphides_, _sulphates_ and _carbonates_ of various metals\r\nform the third class of impurities in clays. Of these, the most\r\nimportant are calcium oxide (lime), calcium carbonate (chalk and\r\nlimestone), calcium sulphate (gypsum and selenite), the corresponding\r\nmagnesia, magnesium carbonate, and sulphate, the various iron oxides,\r\nferrous carbonate and iron sulphides (pyrite and marcasite) (p. 13).\r\n\r\nPotash and soda compounds are commonly present as constituents of the\r\nfelspar, mica, or other silicates present, and need no further\r\ndescription, though small proportions of _soluble salts_--chiefly\r\nsodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium sulphates--occur in most clays\r\nand may cause a white scum on bricks and terra-cotta made from them.\r\n\r\n_Lime and magnesia compounds_ may occur as silicates (varieties of\r\nfelspar, mica, etc.), but their most important occurrence is as chalk or\r\nlimestone. _Chalk_ is a constant constituent of malms[2] and of many\r\nmarls, but the latter may contain limestone particles. _Limestone_\r\noccurs in many marls and to a smaller extent in other clays. In the\r\nboulder clays it frequently forms a large portion of the stony material.\r\nIf the grains are very small (as in chalk), the lime compounds act as a\r\nflux, reducing the heat-resisting power of the clay and increasing the\r\namount of vitrification; they produce in extreme cases a slag-like mass\r\nwhen the clay is intensely heated. If, on the contrary, the grains are\r\nlarger (as frequently occurs with limestone), they are converted into\r\nlime or magnesia when the clay is 'burned' in a kiln, and the lime, on\r\nexposure to weather, absorbs moisture (_i.e. slakes_), swells, and may\r\ndisintegrate the articles made from the clay. Limestone (except when in\r\na very finely divided state) is almost invariably objectionable in\r\nclays, but chalk is frequently a valuable constituent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A _malm_ is a natural mixture of clay and chalk (p. 68).]\r\n\r\nChalk is added to clay in the manufacture of malm-bricks to produce a\r\nmore pleasing colour than would be obtained from the clay alone, to\r\nreduce the shrinkage of the clay to convenient limits and, less\r\nfrequently, to form a more vitrifiable material. Chalk, on heating,\r\ncombines with iron oxide and clay, forming a white silicate, so that\r\nsome clays which would, alone, form a red brick, will, if mixed with\r\nchalk, form a white one.\r\n\r\nLime compounds have the serious objection of acting as very rapid and\r\npowerful fluxes, so that when clays containing them are heated\r\nsufficiently to start partial fusion, a very slight additional rise in\r\ntemperature may easily reduce the whole to a shapeless, slag-like mass.\r\nMagnesia compounds act much more slowly in this respect and so are less\r\nharmful.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum_--a calcium sulphate--occurs naturally in many sub-surface\r\nclays, often in well-defined crystalline masses. It reduces the\r\nheat-resisting power of the clays containing it and may, under some\r\nconditions, rise to the surface of the articles made from the clay, in\r\nthe form of a white efflorescence or scum, such as is seen on some brick\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n_Iron compounds_ are highly important because they exercise a powerful\r\ninfluence on the colour of the burned clays. The red oxide (ferric\r\noxide) is the most useful form in burned clay, but in the raw material\r\nferrous oxide and ferrous carbonate may also occur, though they are\r\nconverted into the red oxide on heating. The red iron oxide, which is\r\nclosely related to 'iron rust,' occurs in so finely divided a state that\r\nits particles appear to be almost as small as those of the finest clays.\r\nHence attempts to improve the colour of terra-cotta and bricks by the\r\naddition of commercial 'iron oxide' are seldom satisfactory, the finest\r\nmaterial obtainable being far coarser than that occurring in clays.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that red iron oxide does not appear to form any\r\ncompound with the other constituents of clay under ordinary conditions\r\nof firing, and although a 'base' and capable of reducing the\r\nheat-resisting power of clays, it does not appear to do so as long as\r\nthe conditions in the kiln are sufficiently oxidizing. It is this which\r\nenables red bricks and other articles to be obtained with remarkable\r\nuniformity of colour combined with great physical strength. In a\r\nreducing atmosphere, on the contrary, ferrous oxide readily forms and\r\nattacks the clay, forming a dark grey vitreous mass. If the iron\r\nparticles are separated from each other they will, on reduction, form\r\nsmall slag-like spots, but if they are in an extremely fine state of\r\ndivision and well distributed, the brick or other article will become\r\nslightly glossy and of an uniform black-grey tint. The famous\r\nStaffordshire 'blue' bricks owe their colour to this characteristic;\r\nthey are not really 'blue' in colour. The effect of chalk on the colour\r\nof red-burning clays has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Iron pyrite_ (fig. 2) and _marcasite_ (fig. 3)--both of which are forms\r\nof iron sulphide--occur in many clays, particularly those of the Coal\r\nMeasures. _Mundic_ is another form of pyrites which resembles roots or\r\ntwigs, but when broken show a brassy fracture. When in pieces of\r\nobservable size the pyrite may be readily distinguished by its\r\nresemblance to polished brass and the marcasite by its tin-white\r\nmetallic lustre and both by their characteristic cubic, root-like and\r\nspherical forms; the latter only show a brass-like sheen when broken.\r\nEven when only a small proportion of mundic, pyrite or marcasite is\r\npresent, it is highly objectionable for several reasons. In the first\r\nplace, half the sulphur present is given off at a dark red heat and is\r\nliable to cause troublesome defects on the goods. Secondly, because the\r\nremaining sulphur and iron are not readily oxidized, so that there is a\r\ngreat tendency to form slag-spots of ferrous silicate, owing to the iron\r\nattacking the clay at the same moment as it parts with its remaining\r\nsulphur. For this reason, clays containing any iron sulphide seldom burn\r\nred, but form products of a buff colour with black spots scattered\r\nirregularly over their surface and throughout the mass--an appearance\r\nreadily observable on most hard-fired firebricks. If chalcopyrite\r\n(copper-iron sulphide) is present the spots may be bright green in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Pyrite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Marcasite.]\r\n\r\nSlightly magnified.\r\n\r\n(_From Miers'_ Mineralogy _by permission of Macmillan & Co._)\r\n\r\n_Carbon_, either free or as hydrocarbons (chiefly vegetable matter) or\r\nin other forms, is a constituent of most clays, though seldom reported\r\nin analyses. Its presence exercises an important influence in several\r\nrespects. On heating the clay, with an ample supply of air, the\r\ncarbonaceous matter may distil off (as shale oil), but more usually it\r\ndecomposes and burns out leaving pores in the material. If the\r\nair-supply is insufficient and the heating is so rapid and intense that\r\nvitrification commences before the carbon is all burned away, the pores\r\nbecome filled with the fused ingredients of the clay, air can no longer\r\nreach the carbon particles and a black 'core' or heart is produced.\r\nUnder peculiarly disadvantageous conditions the material may also swell\r\ngreatly. This is a serious defect in many classes of clay used for\r\nbrickmaking, and its causes and prevention have been exhaustively\r\nstudied by Orton and Griffiths (1)[3] but, beyond the brief summary\r\ngiven above, these are beyond the scope of the present work.\r\n\r\n_Water_ is an essential constituent of all unburned clays, though the\r\nproportion in which it occurs varies within such wide limits that no\r\ndefinite standard can be stated. This water is found in two conditions:\r\n(_a_) as moisture or mechanically mixed with the clay particles and\r\n(_b_) in a state of chemical combination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: References to original papers, etc. will be found in the\r\nappendix.]\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF TYPICAL CLAYS\r\n\r\n_The samples were all dried at 105° C._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  |              Clay | China  | Ball  |Fireclay | Brick  |Boulder| Marl  |\r\n  |                   |  Clay  | Clay  |         |  Clay  | Clay  |       |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  |          Locality |Cornwall| Dorset|Yorkshire|Midlands| Lancs.|Suffolk|\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  |Ultimate Analysis: |        |       |         |        |       |       |\r\n  | Silica            |  47·1  |  49·1 |   68·9  |  57·7  |  63·7 |  43·7 |\r\n  | Alumina           |  39·1  |  33·7 |   19·3  |  24·3  |  20·4 |  15·5 |\r\n  | Ferric oxide      |    ·6  |   1·2 |    1·0  |   5·0  |   3·0 |   5·2 |\r\n  | Titanium oxide    |   --   |    ·2 |    1·8  |    ·1  |    ·2 |  --   |\r\n  | Lime              |    ·4  |    ·8 |     ·9  |   3·7  |   4·3 |  16·3 |\r\n  | Magnesia          |    ·2  |    ·3 |     ·3  |   2·5  |   2·7 |   2·1 |\r\n  | Potash and Soda   |    ·3  |   2·5 |     ·9  |   2·8  |   2·9 |    ·7 |\r\n  | Carbon            |   2·6  |   4·3 |    1·8  |   1·6  |    ·4 |   1·6 |\r\n  | Water             |   9·3  |   7·7 |    4·8  |   2·0  |   2·2 |   2·4 |\r\n  | Other Matter      |    ·4  |    ·2 |     ·3  |    ·3  |    ·2 |  12·5 |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  | Total             | 100·0  | 100·0 |   100·0 |  100·0 | 100·0 | 100·0 |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  |Proximate Analysis:|        |       |         |        |       |       |\r\n  | Gravel and Sand   |   --   |   8·4 |    4·6  |  22·1  |  23·1 |   9·2 |\r\n  | Silt              |   --   |   4·8 |    9·0  |   3·1  |   8·4 |  16·0 |\r\n  | Felspar- and mica-|        |       |         |        |       |       |\r\n  |   dust            |   5·2  |  15·4 |   10·3  |  24·3  |  18·5 |   8·9 |\r\n  | Silica-dust       |   3·1  |   4·0 |   38·0  |   3·1  |  12·6 |   2·0 |\r\n  | Free calcium      |        |       |         |        |       |       |\r\n  |   carbonate       |   --   |   --  |   --    |   2·1  |    ·2 |  28·4 |\r\n  | Free iron oxide   |        |       |         |        |       |       |\r\n  |   and pyrites     |    ·4  |    ·9 |     ·7  |   4·2  |   1·6 |   3·9 |\r\n  | 'True clay'       |  91·3  |  66·5 |   37·4  |  41·1  |  35·6 |  31·6 |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  | Total             | 100·0  | 100·0 |  100·0  | 100·0  | 100·0 | 100·0 |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nFor other analyses the books in the Bibliography at the end of the\r\npresent volume should be consulted, particularly No. 2, _i.e._ _British\r\nClays, Shales and Sands_.\r\n\r\nThe amount of mechanically mixed water will naturally vary with the\r\nconditions to which the clay has been subjected; it will be greatest in\r\nwet situations and will diminish as the clay is allowed to dry.\r\n\r\nThe 'combined water,' on the contrary, appears to be a function of the\r\ntrue clay present in the material, and reaches its highest proportions\r\nin the china clays and kaolins, which contain approximately 13 per cent.\r\nOn heating a clay to 105° C. the moisture or mechanically mixed water is\r\nevaporated, but the combined water remains unaffected[4] until the\r\ntemperature is raised to more than 600° C., when it is driven off and\r\nthe clay is converted into a hard stone-like mass with properties\r\nentirely different from those it previously possessed (see Chapter VI).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Strictly, there is a slight loss at lower temperatures, but\r\nit is too small to be important.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Physical Characters of Clays.\r\n\r\nThe physical characters of clays are of far more interest and importance\r\nthan their chemical ones, though the two are naturally connected in many\r\nways, and just as the chemical composition of clays is a subject of\r\nextreme complexity so is a study of many of their physical properties.\r\nHence only a few of the more important characteristics can be mentioned\r\nhere: for further details the reader must consult a larger treatise (2).\r\n\r\nClays are moderately soft, solid bodies, particularly when moistened,\r\nand can usually be cut with a knife, though some indurated clays and\r\nshales are almost as hard as felspar. Their apparent specific gravity\r\nvaries greatly, some clays being much more porous than others, but the\r\ntrue specific gravity is usually between 2·5 and 2·65; it is similar to\r\nthat of quartz and slightly lower than that of felspar and mica. Many\r\nclays appear to be devoid of structure, but those obtained from a\r\nconsiderable depth below the surface are frequently laminated and have a\r\nstructure not unlike that of mica. This will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nExamined under a microscope, clays are seen to consist of grains of a\r\nvariety of sizes, the largest of which will usually be found to be\r\ncomposed of adventitious materials such as sand, quartz, felspar, mica,\r\nchalk and limestone. The smallest particles--to which clays owe their\r\nchief characteristics--are so minute as to make any examination of their\r\nshape very difficult, but they are usually composed of minute\r\ncrystalline plates together with a much larger proportion of apparently\r\namorphous material. The exact nature of both the crystals and the\r\namorphous material is still unknown in spite of many investigations; in\r\nthe purer clays both forms of substance appear to have the same chemical\r\ncomposition, viz. that of _kaolinite_ (H4Al2Si2O9), which the\r\ncrystalline portion closely resembles.\r\n\r\nClays emit a characteristic yet indefinable odour when moist; the cause\r\nof this is very imperfectly understood, though it is not improbably due\r\nto decomposing organic matter, as this occurs in most clays.\r\n\r\nThe colours of freshly-dug clays are extremely varied and range from an\r\nalmost pure white through all shades of yellow, red and brown to black.\r\nThe predominating colours are grey or greyish brown and a peculiar\r\nyellow characteristic of some surface clays. The natural colour of a\r\nclay is no criterion as to its purity, for some of the darkest ball\r\nclays produce perfectly white ware on burning, whilst some of the paler\r\nclays are useless to the potter on account of the intensity of their\r\ncolour when they come out of the kiln. The colour of raw clays is\r\nlargely due to the carbonaceous matter they contain, and as this burns\r\naway in the kiln, the final colour of the ware bears no relation\r\nwhatever to that of the original clay.\r\n\r\nThe colour of burned ware depends upon the iron compounds in the\r\nclay--these producing buff, red, brown or black (usually termed 'blue')\r\narticles--on the presence of finely divided calcium carbonate (chalk)\r\nwhich can destroy the colouring power of iron compounds and produce\r\nwhite ware, and on the treatment the clay has received in the kiln. A\r\nclay which is white when underfired will usually darken in colour if\r\nheated to vitrification, and one which burns red in an oxidizing\r\natmosphere may turn blue-grey or black under reducing conditions. The\r\nextent to which the carbonaceous matter is burned out also determines\r\nthe colour of the fired ware.\r\n\r\nThe presence of adventitious minerals in the clay may also affect its\r\ncolour, particularly when fired.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious feature in a piece of moist clay is its _plasticity_[5]\r\nor ability to alter its shape when kneaded or put under slight pressure\r\nand to retain its new shape after the pressure has been removed. It is\r\nthis property which enables the production of ornaments, vessels of\r\nvarious kinds, and the many other articles which are the result of the\r\napplication of modelling tools, of moulding or of the action of a\r\npotter's wheel. So long as clay contains a suitable proportion of\r\nmoisture it is plastic and may be made into articles of any desired\r\nshape, but if the amount of moisture in it is reduced or removed\r\ncompletely, the material is no longer plastic. It may become so,\r\nhowever, on adding a further suitable quantity of water and mixing,\r\nprovided that it has not been excessively heated. If, in the removal of\r\nthe moisture, the clay has been heated to 600° C. or more, it loses its\r\npower of becoming plastic and is converted into a material more closely\r\nresembling stone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A plastic substance is one with the characteristics of 'a\r\nfluid of so great a viscosity that it does not lose its shape under the\r\ninfluence of gravitation.']\r\n\r\nThe causes of plasticity appear to be somewhat numerous, though there is\r\nno generally accepted explanation of this remarkable quality which\r\ndistinguishes clays from most other substances. It is true that wet\r\nsand, soap, wax, lead and some other materials possess a certain amount\r\nof plasticity, but not to anything like the same extent as clay.\r\n\r\nSo far as clays are concerned, their plasticity appears to be connected\r\nwith the presence of combined water as well as of mechanically mixed\r\nwater, for if either of these are removed, plasticity--both actual and\r\npotential--is destroyed. The part played by water is not, however,\r\ncompletely known, for the many theories which have been advanced only\r\ncover some of the conditions and facts.\r\n\r\nA number of observers agree that the molecular constitution of clay is\r\npeculiar and that it is to this that plasticity is due. Yet the curious\r\nfact that the purest clays--the kaolins--are remarkably deficient in\r\nplasticity shows that molecular constitution is not, alone, sufficient.\r\nOthers hold that the remarkably small size of clay particles enables\r\nthem to pack together more closely than do particles of other materials\r\nand to retain around them a film of water which acts partly as a\r\nlubricant, facilitating the change of shape of the mass when under\r\npressure, and partly as an adhesive, causing the particles to adhere to\r\neach other when the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nZschokke has laid much emphasis on the importance of molecular\r\nattraction between clay and water as a cause of plasticity, and has\r\nsuggested that the absorption of the water effects a change in the\r\nsurfaces of the clay particles, giving them a gelatinous nature and\r\nenabling them to change their form and yet keep in close contact.\r\n\r\nThe fact that mica, fluorspar and quartz, when in a sufficiently finely\r\ndivided state, are also slightly plastic, appears to be opposed to the\r\nmolecular constitution theory. Smallness of grain undoubtedly has an\r\ninfluence on the plasticity of clay, coarse-grained clays being notably\r\nless plastic than others.\r\n\r\nDaubrée pointed out that felspar, when ground with water, develops\r\nplasticity to a small extent, and Olschewsky carried this observation\r\nfurther and has suggested that clays owe their plasticity to prolonged\r\ncontact with water during their removal from their place of formation\r\nand previous to or during their deposition. A further confirmation of\r\nthis theory is due to Mellor (3) who showed that on heating china clay\r\nwith water under very considerable pressure its plasticity was increased\r\nand that felspar and some other non-plastic materials developed\r\nplasticity under these conditions.\r\n\r\nJohnson and Blake (21) supposed that plasticity is due to the clay being\r\ncomposed of extremely minute plates 'bunched together,' a view which was\r\nalso held by Biedermann and Herzfield, Le Chatelier and others.\r\nOlschewsky enlarged this theory by suggesting that the plasticity of\r\ncertain clays is dependent on the large surface and the interlocking of\r\nirregular particles with the plates just mentioned. These theories of\r\ninterlocking are, however, incomplete, because the tensile strength of\r\nclays should accurately represent the plasticity if interlocking were\r\nthe sole cause. Zschokke has shown that tensile strength is only one\r\nfactor which must be determined in any attempt to measure plasticity.\r\n\r\nE. H. L. Schwarz (35) has suggested that many clays are composed of\r\nsmall globular masses of plates so arranged as to form an open network\r\n(fig. 4) which is sufficiently strong not to be destroyed by pressure.\r\nIn the presence of water and much rubbing the plates are separated and\r\nare made to lie flat on each other, thereby giving a plastic and\r\nimpermeable mass. If this is really the case it would explain the\r\nporosity and large surface of some clays and might account for their\r\nadsorptive power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Illustrating the structure of a 'clay crumb.'\r\n(_After Schwarz._)]\r\n\r\nA theory which was first promulgated in 1850 by Way (4), but which has\r\nonly received detailed attention during the last few years, attributes\r\nplasticity to the presence of colloid substances in clay or to the fact\r\nthat clay particles possess physical characters analogous to those of\r\nglue and other colloids. These colloid substances have a submicroscopic\r\nor micellian structure; they are web-like, porous and absorb water\r\neagerly. This water may be removed by drying, only to be re-absorbed on\r\ncooling, but if the heating temperature is excessive the structure of\r\nthe colloids is destroyed. This colloid theory explains many of the\r\nfacts noted by earlier investigators such as Aron, Bischof, Seger,\r\nOlschewsky, etc., but it is not entirely satisfactory, though Rohland\r\n(5)--to whom the present prominence of this theory in Europe is largely\r\ndue--persistently maintains the contrary. One great objection is the\r\nfact that no characteristic _inorganic_ colloid substance has been\r\nisolated from pure clay. It is possible that some of the so-called\r\n'colloidal' properties of clay may be due to the smallness of its\r\nparticles and to their great porosity, as suggested by Olschewsky.\r\n\r\nDespite the present impossibility of producing a plastic material from\r\nartificially prepared colloidal hydro-alumino-silicates of the same\r\nultimate composition as clay, and the fact that the addition of\r\ncolloidal substances does not necessarily increase the true plasticity\r\nof clay, it cannot be denied that the presence of colloids has an\r\nimportant influence on it. The addition of starches, glue, gums and\r\nsimilar substances whilst apparently increasing the plasticity of clay\r\ndoes not do so in reality. The addition of 1 per cent. of tannin, on the\r\ncontrary, has been found by Ries (6) to increase both plasticity and\r\nbinding power.\r\n\r\nPlasticity appears to be composed of a number of characteristics so that\r\nit is scarcely likely that any single cause can be assigned to it. On\r\nthe contrary, a study of the binding power, tensile strength,\r\nextensibility, adsorption, texture and molecular constitution of clays\r\nsuggests very strongly that all these properties are involved in the\r\nproduction of plasticity and that it is due to the chemical as well as\r\nthe physical nature of clay. No clay is entirely colloidal--or it would\r\nbe elastic and not plastic--but all appear to contain both colloidal and\r\nnon-colloidal (including plate-like) particles, and it is not improbable\r\nthat materials in both these states are required, the colloidal matter\r\nacting as a cement. Ries (6) has, in fact, pointed out that colloids\r\nalone lack cohesiveness and solidity, and a fine mineral aggregate is\r\nnecessary to change them into a plastic mass resembling clay. The\r\nrelative proportions of the colloidal material and the sizes of the\r\nnon-plastic grains will exercise an important influence on all the\r\nphysical characteristics mentioned above, and therefore on the\r\nplasticity.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which slightly plastic clays become highly plastic in\r\nnature is by no means certainly known. It has long been understood that\r\nthe increase of plasticity is due to changes undergone by the clay\r\nduring transportation. The most illuminating suggestion is that made by\r\nAcheson in 1902, who concluded that it is due to impurities in the water\r\nused in transporting the clay or remaining in contact with it during and\r\nafter its deposition. These impurities may be considered as derived from\r\nthe washings of forests, and after many experiments with plant extracts\r\nAcheson believed the most important substance in this connection to be\r\ntannin or gallo-tannic acid, a dilute solution of which he found\r\nincreased the plasticity of china clay by 300 per cent. From this he\r\nfurther argued that the use of chopped straw by the Israelites in Egypt\r\nin the manufacture of bricks was unconsciously based on the tannin\r\ncontent of the straw increasing the plasticity of the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Chart showing rates of drying. (_After\r\nBleininger._)]\r\n\r\nBeadle has stated that 2 per cent. of dissolved cellulose will increase\r\nthe plasticity of china clay and make it equal to that of ordinary\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nPlasticity is diminished by heating clays, and whilst much of it may be\r\nrecovered if the temperature has not risen above 400° C. it cannot be\r\ncompletely restored. Moreover, a clay which has once been heated to a\r\ntemperature above 100° C. dries in a somewhat different manner to a raw\r\nclay. This is well shown in fig. 5 in which are summarized the results\r\nobtained by A. V. Bleininger on a sample of ball clay from Dorset before\r\nheating and after portions of it had been heated for 16 hours to 200°,\r\n250°, 300°, 350° and 400° C. respectively. It is not impossible that if\r\nsubjected to the influence of water for a sufficiently long time the\r\nwhole of the plasticity of a heated clay may be restored, providing that\r\nthe temperature has not been sufficient to cause a destruction of the\r\nclay molecule, but as this resumption requires a certain amount of time,\r\nBleininger has proposed to use the reduction in plasticity effected by\r\nthe heating to enable excessively plastic clays to be worked without the\r\nnecessity of adding non-plastic material to them. If any destruction of\r\nthe clay-molecules has occurred, the plasticity of that portion of the\r\nclay can never be restored.\r\n\r\nThe _binding power_ of clays is a characteristic closely connected with\r\nplasticity and occasionally confused with it. All plastic clays have the\r\npower of remaining plastic when mixed with materials such as sand,\r\nbrick-dust ('grog') and other materials which are quite devoid of\r\nplasticity. The extent to which a clay can thus bind other materials\r\ntogether into a plastic mass depends, apparently, on the plasticity of\r\nthe clay itself and on the size and nature of the particles of the added\r\nmaterial; the more plastic the clay the larger will be the amount of\r\nmaterial it can thus 'bind,' and the finer the latter the more easily\r\nwill it form a strong material when mixed with a plastic clay.\r\n\r\nRohland (5) has shown that the binding power of clay is not alone due to\r\nits cohesion, but that it is closely associated with the colloidal\r\nnature of plastic clays: 'fat' clays being those which are highly\r\ncolloidal, highly plastic and possessing great binding power, whilst\r\n'lean' clays are those deficient in these characteristics. The fact\r\nthat, as a general rule, the dark coloured clays possess the most\r\nbinding power, confirms this suggestion, as the dark colour is largely\r\ndue to organic materials, probably in a colloidal state.\r\n\r\nThe _shrinkage_ which all clays undergo on drying and when heated is\r\nanother important characteristic. It is due to the fact that as water is\r\nremoved the solid particles approach closer to each other, the volume of\r\nthe whole mass being thereby reduced. In a wet piece of clay each\r\nparticle is surrounded by a film of water, the thickness of which\r\ndepends on the nature of the clay. As this water evaporates from the\r\nsurface of the clay its place is taken by water from the interior which\r\nrises to the surface by capillary attraction. So long as there is any\r\nwater between the particles of clay there will be shrinkage when this\r\nwater is removed, but a stage is eventually reached when the particles\r\nof clay are in contact with each other and no more shrinkage can occur.\r\nThat this cessation of shrinkage may take place before all the water has\r\nbeen removed from the clay is easily understood when it is remembered\r\nthat whilst the clay particles may be in contact, yet there are still\r\nplaces (pores) where the contact is incomplete, and in these pores water\r\nmay be retained. The amount of shrinkage clays undergo on drying depends\r\npartly on the proportion of water added to them and partly on the sizes\r\nof the different particles of clay, sand, etc. present. An average\r\nreduction in volume of 12 to 38 per cent. may be regarded as normal, but\r\ncoarse loams may shrink only 1 per cent. and very finely ground, highly\r\nplastic ball clays may shrink as much as 50 per cent., though this is\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nAs all coagulated colloids, which have absorbed water, shrink on drying,\r\nthis behaviour of clay appears to confirm the view as to its partially\r\ncolloidal nature held by some investigators.\r\n\r\nWhen a piece of dry clay is heated sufficiently a further shrinkage\r\n(technically known as _kiln shrinkage_) occurs. This begins somewhat\r\nbelow a red heat and increases in rough proportion to the temperature\r\nand the duration of the heating. Prolonged heating at a lower\r\ntemperature will effect the same amount of shrinkage as a short exposure\r\nto a higher temperature, but though the greater part of the shrinkage\r\noccurs in a comparatively short time, continued heating will be\r\naccompanied by a further reduction in volume.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that clays have no definite melting point, but\r\nundergo partial fusion at all temperatures above 950° C. or, in some\r\ncases, at even lower ones. As a portion of the material fuses, it fills\r\nup the pores in the mass and attacks the unfused material, this process\r\nbeing continued until either the heating is stopped or the whole\r\nmaterial is reduced to a viscous slag.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the volume of commercial articles made of clay and\r\nplaced in kilns varies greatly. With bricks, terra-cotta and pottery it\r\nmust not, usually, exceed 40 per cent. or the warping and cracking which\r\noccur will be so great as to make the articles useless. The fineness of\r\nthe particles exercises an important influence on the kiln shrinkage of\r\na clay, and the latter is frequently reduced in commercial clayworking\r\nby adding burned clay ground to a coarse powder to the plastic clay\r\nbefore it is used. Sand is sometimes added for the same purpose, though\r\nits more frequent use is to reduce the shrinkage in drying.\r\n\r\nQuartz and other forms of free silica expand on heating, so that clays\r\ncontaining them in large quantities shrink very slightly or may even\r\nexpand.\r\n\r\nAs clays shrink equally in all directions it is usual to state the\r\ncontraction in linear instead of volume form. Thus instead of stating\r\nthat a certain clay when moulded into bricks, dried and burned, shrinks\r\n18 per cent. by volume, it is customary to state that it shrinks 3/4 in.\r\nper (linear) foot. For many purposes, it is sufficient to regard the\r\nlinear shrinkage as one-third the volume-shrinkage, but this is not\r\nstrictly accurate.\r\n\r\nThe _fusibility_ of clays is a characteristic which has been very\r\nimperfectly studied. Most clayworkers and investigators employ the term\r\n'fusibility' in a special sense which is apt to be misleading. Owing to\r\nthe extremely high temperatures to which refractory clays can be heated\r\nwithout even losing their shape, it is almost impossible to fuse them\r\ncompletely. In addition to this, clays are not perfectly homogeneous\r\nmaterials and some of their constituents melt at lower temperatures than\r\nothers. For this reason a clay may show signs of fusion at 1100° C., but\r\nit may be heated for some hours at 1800° C. and yet not be completely\r\nmelted! Consequently no single 'fusing point' can be stated.\r\n\r\nIn practice, a suggestion made many years ago by Seger (7) is used; the\r\nclay to be tested is made into a small tetrahedron (fig. 6), heated\r\nslowly until it bends over and the point of the test-piece is almost on\r\na level with the base. The temperature at which this occurs is termed\r\nthe 'fusing point' though it really only indicates the heat-treatment\r\nwhich is sufficient to soften the material sufficiently to cause it to\r\nbend in the manner described. In spite of the apparent crudeness of the\r\ntest this 'softening point' appears to be fairly constant for most\r\nrefractory clays.\r\n\r\nThe bending of a test-piece in this manner is the result of the action\r\nof all fluxes[6] in the clay, and as this depends on the size of grain\r\nand the duration of the heating above incipient fusion and does not give\r\na direct measure of temperature, nor is the softening effect under one\r\nrate of rise in temperature the same as that at another rate.\r\nNevertheless a study of the behaviour of various clays heated\r\nsimultaneously is valuable and the method forms a convenient means of\r\ncomparing different materials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: For fluxing materials see p. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature may be measured by means of a pyrometer, but for the\r\nreason just stated it is more convenient and in some respects more\r\naccurate to use standard mixtures known as Seger Cones (fig. 6), and to\r\nstate the softening point in terms of the 'cone' which behaves like the\r\nclay being tested. A medium fireclay will not soften below Seger Cone 26\r\n(1650° C.) and a really good one will have a softening point of cone 34\r\nor 35 (1750° to 1800° C.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Seger Cones indicating a temperature of 1250° C.]\r\n\r\nThe _refractoriness_ of a clay, or its resistance to high temperatures,\r\nis an important requirement in bricks required for furnace linings, in\r\ncrucibles, gas retorts and other articles used in the metallurgical and\r\nother industries. The term is much abused and is frequently understood\r\nto mean resistance to the cutting action of flue gases and flame, the\r\ncorrosive action of slags, and the strains set up by the repeated\r\nchanges in temperature. This is unfortunate, for the term refractoriness\r\nhas a perfectly definite meaning and should be employed exclusively to\r\ndenote that a given clay is capable of retaining its shape at a given\r\ntemperature or under given conditions when heated alone and without\r\nbeing subjected to any pressure. In Great Britain there is no officially\r\nrecognized standard of minimum refractoriness[7], but where one is\r\nrequired the suggested minimum of Seger Cone 26 (1650° C.) made by E.\r\nCramer (8) is usually employed. This is the recognized minimum in\r\nGermany for fireclays, and though objections may be urged against the\r\nuse of Seger Cones as a standard, equally forcible ones may be brought\r\nagainst making a temperature-scale the basis of measurement. Under\r\npresent circumstances, however, it is necessary to adopt one or other of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See _Refractory Clays_, Chapter V.]\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to ascertain the relationship (if any)\r\nbetween the refractoriness of clays and their chemical composition. If\r\nattention is confined strictly to the more refractory clays, some kind\r\nof relationship does appear to exist. Thus Richter found that the\r\nrefractoriness of clay is influenced by certain oxides in the following\r\norder: magnesia, lime, ferrous oxide, soda and potash, but this only\r\napplies to clays containing less than 3 per cent. of all these oxides.\r\nCramer, in 1895, found that free silica also interfered with the action\r\nof these oxides and more recently Ludwig (9) has devised a chart (fig.\r\n7), on the upright sides of which are plotted the equivalents of the\r\nlime, magnesia and alkalies, whilst the silica equivalents are plotted\r\non the horizontal base. In each case the 'molecular formula' of the clay\r\nis calculated from its percentage composition, and this 'formula' is\r\nreduced so as to have one 'molecule' of alumina, thereby fixing the\r\nalumina as a constant and reducing the number of variables to two--the\r\nmetallic oxides and the silica. Unfortunately Ludwig's chart is only\r\napplicable to the more refractory clays and cannot be relied upon even\r\nfor these, though it is extremely useful for comparing clays from\r\nidentical or similar geological formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Ludwig's Chart.]\r\n\r\nAttempts to express the refractoriness of clays by means of formulae\r\nproving abortive, there only remains the direct test of heating a clay\r\nunder definite conditions in the manner previously described.\r\n\r\n_Vitrification_ is closely connected with the fusibility and\r\nrefractoriness of clays, and, as a term, indicates the amount of fusion\r\nwhich has occurred under certain conditions of heating. As already\r\nmentioned, all clays, on being subjected to a high temperature, undergo\r\npartial fusion, the more powerful bases attacking the finest particles\r\nof clay and silica, forming molten silicates, and then slowly attacking\r\nthe more refractory portion; this slow fusion and solution continues\r\nuntil the whole of the material is melted. If the heating is stopped\r\nbefore the fusion has begun, the clay will be porous and comparatively\r\nsoft, but as more and more material fuses, the mass (on cooling) becomes\r\nharder and less porous, as the fused material occupies the pores and\r\nsets to a dense, firm glassy mass. The amount of vitrification, or\r\npartial fusion, which occurs is, therefore, of great importance in some\r\nindustries, as by stopping it at an appropriate stage articles of any\r\ndesired degree of porosity, translucency or strength may be obtained.\r\nThus for common bricks, only sufficient vitrification is permitted to\r\nbind the particles firmly together, but in engineering bricks--where\r\nmuch greater strength is required--the vitrification is more complete.\r\nPorcelain and earthenware may be similarly distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which a given clay will vitrify depends on the amount of\r\nfluxing material (metallic compounds, and oxides other than ferric oxide\r\nand alumina) it contains, on the smallness of its particles and on the\r\nduration and intensity of the heating. Clays containing alkalies and\r\nlime compounds vitrify with great rapidity when once the necessary\r\ntemperature has been reached, so that unless great care is exercised the\r\naction will proceed too far and the goods will be warped and twisted or\r\nmay even form a rough slag. Refractory clays, on the contrary, vitrify\r\nmore slowly and at much higher temperatures so that accidental\r\noverheatings of them are far less common.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the temperature at which sintering\r\nor vitrification occurs and that at which the clay melts\r\ncompletely--usually termed the 'vitrification range'--varies with the\r\nnature of the clay. In some cases the clay melts as soon as\r\nvitrification becomes noticeable, in others the vitrification occurs at\r\na dull red heat, but the material does not lose its shape until after a\r\nprolonged heating at the highest temperature of a firebrick kiln or\r\ntesting furnace.\r\n\r\nCalcareous clays have the melting and sintering points close together,\r\nso that it is almost impossible to produce vitrified and impervious ware\r\nfrom them, as they lose their shape too readily. If, however, the\r\ndifference between the sintering and fusing temperatures can be\r\nenlarged--that is, if the vitrification range can be extended--more\r\nimpervious ware can be made. The easiest means of extending the\r\nvitrification range consists in regulating the proportion of large and\r\nsmall particles. The former increase and the latter diminish the range.\r\n\r\nBasic compounds and fluxes cause a lowering of the melting-point and a\r\nshortening of the vitrification range.\r\n\r\nThe _porosity_ of raw clay is usually of small importance, but the\r\nporosity of fired clay or ware is often a serious factor in determining\r\nthe suitability of certain articles for their intended purposes. In its\r\nnatural state, clay does not readily absorb much water; on the contrary\r\nit becomes pasty and impervious unless it is disturbed and its texture\r\ndestroyed, when it may be mixed with water to form a paste or, with more\r\nwater, a thin 'cream' or 'slurry.'\r\n\r\nWhen heated moderately, clay forms a porous material and, unless the\r\nheating is excessive, it will absorb about one-eighth of its weight of\r\nwater. Further heating at a higher temperature reduces its porosity--the\r\nmore easily fused material filling some of the pores--until a stage is\r\nreached when the material is completely vitrified and is no longer\r\nporous.\r\n\r\nPorosity may thus be regarded as the opposite of vitrification; porous\r\ngoods being relatively light and soft whilst vitrified ones are dense\r\nand hard. For some purposes, porosity is an important characteristic:\r\nfor example, building bricks which are moderately porous are preferable\r\nto those which are vitrified. The manufacture of porous blocks for the\r\nconstruction of light, sound-proof partitions, etc. has increased\r\nrapidly of late. They are made by adding sawdust or other combustible\r\nmaterial to the clay. The added substances burn out on firing the goods\r\nin a kiln.\r\n\r\nClays which are porous can be dried more readily and with less risk of\r\ncracking than those which are more dense. For this reason, some\r\nclayworkers mix non-plastic material such as sand or burned clay with\r\ntheir raw material.\r\n\r\nThe _impermeability_ of plastic clay to water is a characteristic which\r\nis important for many purposes.\r\n\r\nThe _absorptive power_ of clays is closely related to their porosity so\r\nfar as pure water is concerned, but if the water contains certain salts\r\nin solution a selective absorption occurs, the bases being retained by\r\nthe clay in such a manner that they cannot be removed by washing. The\r\nselective action is known as _adsorption_ and is most noticeable in\r\nhighly plastic clays. Bourry (10) has shown that the slightly plastic\r\nchina clays only exercise a small power of adsorbing calcium carbonate\r\nfrom solution, but highly plastic clays may adsorb 20 per cent. of it.\r\nThe alkaline chlorides and sulphates do not appear to be adsorbed in\r\nthis manner, but the carbonates are readily removed from solution. All\r\ncalcium and magnesium compounds appear to be adsorbed, though in\r\nvariable quantities, the reaction being complicated when several soluble\r\nsalts are present. Ries (6) has found that gallo-tannic acid is adsorbed\r\nreadily and increases the plasticity of clay.\r\n\r\nAshley (11) has endeavoured to measure the plasticity of clays by\r\ndetermining their adsorption capacity for various aniline dyes, but his\r\nuntimely decease prevented the investigation being completed. There is\r\nreason to suppose that the relation between adsorption and plasticity is\r\nextremely close in many clays and that the former may, to an important\r\nextent, be used as a measure of the latter. In some clays, however, this\r\nrelationship does not exist.\r\n\r\nSand and burned clay only show faint adsorption phenomena; felspar shows\r\nthem to a slight and almost negligible extent and most of the other\r\nnon-plastic ingredients of clays are non-adsorptive.\r\n\r\nSelective adsorption being an important characteristic of colloidal\r\nsubstances, the possession of this power by plastic clays supports the\r\nclaim that plasticity is due, at least in part, to the presence of\r\ncolloids.\r\n\r\nThe addition of small quantities of a solution of certain substances to\r\na stiff clay paste usually reduces its stiffness, and in some cases\r\nturns it into a liquid. The alkalies are particularly powerful in this\r\nrespect and their action may be strikingly illustrated by mixing a few\r\ndrops of caustic soda with a stiff clay paste. In a few moments the\r\nmixture will be sufficiently liquid to pour readily, but it may be\r\nrendered quite stiff again by adding sufficient acid to neutralize the\r\nalkali previously used. Weber (12) has utilized this characteristic to\r\ngreat advantage in the production of sanitary ware and crucibles for\r\nglass-making by a process of casting which he has patented.\r\n\r\nThe effect of adding water to a dry clay is curious. At first the\r\nparticles in contact with the water become sticky and plastic, and if\r\nthe proportion of water added is suitable and the mixing is sufficiently\r\nthorough a plastic mass will be produced, the characteristics of which\r\nwill depend on the nature of the clay used. This process of mixing clay\r\nwith a limited amount of water is known as 'tempering.' The proportion\r\nof water required to make a paste of suitable consistency for modelling\r\nappears to be constant for each clay. If, however, a larger proportion\r\nof water is added the particles of clay will be separated so widely from\r\neach other that they lose their cohesion, and instead of a plastic mass,\r\nthe material will form a liquid of cream-like consistency. If a piece of\r\nstiff clay paste is suspended in a large volume of water without\r\nstirring, disintegration will still occur (though a much longer time\r\nwill be required) and the clay will be deposited as a sediment at the\r\nbottom of the vessel. The leaner the clay or the larger the proportion\r\nof non-plastic material it contains, the more rapidly will this\r\ndisintegration take place. A highly plastic clay will become almost\r\nimpervious and will retain its shape indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIf a mixture of clay and water in the form of a cream or slurry be\r\nallowed to rest, the larger and less plastic particles will settle, but\r\nmany of the particles of true clay will remain suspended for several\r\nhours and some of them for several days. Some particles of clay are so\r\nsmall that it is doubtful if they would ever settle completely unless\r\nsome coagulant were added, and as they readily pass through all ordinary\r\nfiltering media it is extremely difficult to collect them in a pure\r\nstate. These turbid suspensions of clay may be rapidly cleared by the\r\naddition of sodium chloride which increases the surface tension of the\r\nsolution. The fine particles behave in the same way as colloidal\r\nsubstances, _i.e._ as if they possessed an electrostatic charge. Hence\r\nthe addition of a salt (electrolyte), whose ions annul the opposite\r\ncharges of the electric double layer assumed by Helmholtz to be present,\r\nenables the particles to coagulate in accordance with the ordinary laws\r\nof surface tension (14).\r\n\r\n_Exposure_ to the action of air and frost has a marked effect on many\r\nclays. When freshly dug these may be hard and difficult to crush, but\r\nafter exposure they break up readily into small fragments. Clays differ\r\ngreatly in the extent to which they are affected by exposure; some are\r\ncompletely disintegrated by standing 48 hours in the open air, whilst\r\nothers are scarcely affected by exposure in bleak places through several\r\nyears of storm, sunshine and frost. Usually, however, the effect of a\r\ncouple of nights exposure to hard frost will produce a marked\r\ndisintegration of the material.\r\n\r\nThis process of exposure is known as 'weathering' and its effects are so\r\nimportant that it is employed whenever possible for clays requiring to\r\nbe crushed before use. All clays are rendered more workable by exposure,\r\nbut some of them are damaged by the oxidation of some impurities (_e.g._\r\npyrites) in them, though in other clays this very oxidation, if followed\r\nby the leaching action of rain, effects an important purification of the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWeathering appears to have no effect on the chemical composition of the\r\nparticles of true clay in the material, though it may decompose the\r\nimpurities present. On the clay itself its action is largely physical\r\nand consists chiefly in separating the particles slightly from each\r\nother, thereby enabling water to penetrate the material more readily and\r\nfacilitating the production of a plastic paste. The disintegrating\r\naction of the weather on some 'clays' is so complete that they require\r\nno crushing but can be converted into a homogeneous paste by simply\r\nkneading them with a suitable proportion of water.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that on exposure to the heat of the sun's\r\nrays--particularly in tropical climates--some chemical decomposition of\r\nthe clay may occur, but compared with the purely physical action of\r\nweathering the amount of such chemical decomposition must be relatively\r\nunimportant in most cases. It may, however, account for the presence of\r\nfree silica and free alumina in some clays.\r\n\r\nThe action of the weather on rocks, resulting in the formation of clays,\r\nis described in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n_Heat_ effects remarkable changes in the physical character of clays;\r\nthe most important of these have already been noted. At a gentle heat,\r\nthe clay is dried and retains most of its power of becoming plastic when\r\nmoistened; very little, if any, decomposition occurs. At a higher\r\ntemperature it loses its 'combined water,' the clay molecule apparently\r\ndissociating, and a hard stony mass--consisting of particles of free\r\nsilica and free alumina cemented together by the more easily fusible\r\nimpurities present--is formed. If the heating is continued the hardness\r\nof the material is increased owing to more molten silicate having been\r\nproduced from the impurities present, and on cooling, its tensile\r\nstrength and resistance to crushing will be found to be enormously\r\ngreater than those of the original clay. All potential plasticity is\r\ndestroyed by heating to 700° C. and no method of restoring it has yet\r\nbeen devised. As clays are abundant, this is not a serious disadvantage\r\nfor the specially desired characteristics of bricks, terra-cotta,\r\npottery and porcelain are all such as to be incompatible with\r\nplasticity. The latter is extremely valuable in the shaping of the wares\r\nmentioned, but after the manufacture is completed, the destruction of\r\nthe plasticity is an essential feature of their usefulness.\r\n\r\nIf the heating is very prolonged or is repeated several times, clays\r\nchange other of their physical characters and become brittle and liable\r\nto crack under sudden changes of temperature. This is partly due to the\r\nfurther fusion (vitrification) which occurs and partly to the formation\r\nof crystalline silicates, notably _Sillimanite_ (13).\r\n\r\nThe extent to which clays are ordinarily heated and the conditions under\r\nwhich they are cooled do not usually induce the formation of crystals;\r\nthe object of the clayworker being to produce a homogeneous mass, the\r\nparticles of which are securely held together. The result is that burned\r\nclay products are usually composed of amorphous particles cemented by a\r\nglass-like material formed by the fusion of some of the mineral\r\ningredients of the original substance. The silicates formed are,\r\ntherefore, in a condition of solid, super-cooled solution in which the\r\ntendency to crystallize is restrained by viscosity.\r\n\r\nOn raising the temperature of firing or on prolonging the heating at the\r\nprevious maximum temperature the viscosity of the fused portion is\r\ndiminished and crystallization may then occur. The facility with which\r\ncrystallization occurs varies greatly with the composition of the fused\r\nmaterial, those silicates which are rich in lime and magnesia\r\ncrystallizing more readily than those containing potash or soda. Vogt\r\nhas stated that small quantities of alumina promote the formation of a\r\nglassy structure, and Morozewicz has shown that a large excess of this\r\nsubstance must be present if crystallization is to occur.\r\n\r\nThe study of the reactions which occur when clays are heated is,\r\nhowever, extremely complex, not only on account of the variety of\r\nsubstances present, but also on account of the high temperatures at\r\nwhich it is necessary to work, so that for a further consideration of it\r\nthe reader should consult special treatises on the fusion of silicates.\r\nThis subject has now become an important branch of physical chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCLAY AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nClay, as already mentioned, is geologically a rock and not a mineral,\r\nand belongs to the important group of sedimentary rocks which have been\r\nderived from the igneous or primary ones by processes of weathering,\r\nsuspension in water and subsequent deposition or sedimentation.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the primary origin of clay, its chief occurrence is in\r\ngeological formations which have undoubtedly been formed by aqueous\r\naction. The materials resulting from the exposure of primary rocks to\r\nthe action of the elements have been carried away by water--often for\r\nlong distances--and after undergoing various purifications have been\r\ndeposited where the speed of the water has been sufficiently reduced.\r\n\r\nIn some cases they have again been transported and re-deposited and not\r\ninfrequently clay deposits are found which show signs of subsequent\r\nimmersion at considerable depths and have every appearance of having\r\nbeen subjected to enormous pressures and possibly to high temperatures.\r\n\r\nSome clays have only been carried by small streams and for short\r\ndistances; these are seldom highly plastic and resemble the lean china\r\nclays and kaolins. Others have been carried by rapidly moving rivers and\r\nhave been discharged into lakes or into the sea; they have thus\r\nundergone a process of gradual purification by elutriation, the sand and\r\nother heavier particles being first deposited and the far smaller\r\nparticles of clay being carried a greater distance towards the centre of\r\nthe lake or the quieter portions of the ocean. The nature of such\r\ndeposits will, naturally, differ greatly from each other, the materials\r\nat first associated with the clay, or becoming mixed with it at a later\r\nstage, exercising an important influence on its texture, composition and\r\nproperties. If the transporting stream flows through valleys whose sides\r\nare formed of limestone, chalk, sandstone or other materials, these will\r\nbecome mixed with the clay, and to so great an extent has the mixing\r\noccurred that very few clays occur in a state even approximating to\r\npurity. The majority of clays are contaminated with iron oxide, lime\r\ncompounds and free silica in such a fine state of division that it is\r\nimpossible to purify them completely without destroying the nature of\r\nthe clay. In addition to this it must be remembered that the land is\r\ncontinually rising or sinking owing to internal changes in the interior\r\nof the earth, and that these subterranean changes bring about tilting,\r\nfolding, overturning and other secondary changes, which, later, cause a\r\nfresh set of materials to be mixed with the clays. Further than this,\r\nthe action of the weather, of rivers and of the sea never ceases, so\r\nthat a process of re-mixing and re-sorting of materials is continuously\r\ntaking place, and has been doing so for countless ages. It is,\r\ntherefore, a legitimate cause for wonder that such enormous deposits of\r\nclays of so uniform a character should occur throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Europe, and practically throughout the world. For although\r\nthe composition of many of these beds is of a most highly complex\r\nnature, the general properties such as plasticity, behaviour on heating,\r\netc., remain remarkably constant over large areas of country, and the\r\nclays of each geological formation are so much alike in different parts\r\nof the world as to be readily recognized by anyone familiar with the\r\nmaterial of the same formations in this country. Considerable\r\ndifferences undoubtedly exist, but these are insignificant in comparison\r\nwith the vastly different circumstances under which the deposits were\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nLeaving the consideration of the modes of formation of the various clay\r\ndeposits to later chapters (III and IV), it is convenient here to\r\nenumerate some of the chief characteristics of the different clay\r\ndeposits and their associated rocks. In this connection it is not\r\nproposed to enter into minute details, but rather to indicate in broad\r\noutline the chief characteristics of the clays from the different\r\ndeposits. This general view is the more necessary as clay occurs in each\r\nmain geological division of the sedimentary rocks and in almost every\r\nsub-division in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe =Precambrian, Cambrian, Silurian and Devonian= 'clays' are chiefly\r\nin the form of shales or slates, the latter being clays which have\r\nundergone a metamorphic change; the latter resulted in the production of\r\na hard and partially crystalline material with but little potential\r\nplasticity and therefore of small importance for the ordinary purposes\r\nof clay working.\r\n\r\n_Slates_ are distinguished from shales by their splitting into thin\r\nleaves which are not in the plane of original deposition, but are due to\r\nthe deposited material being subjected to great lateral pressure. The\r\nre-arrangement of the particles thus produced has imparted to the\r\nmaterial a cleavage quite independent of the original lamination.\r\n\r\nThe shales in these formations are occasionally soft and friable and are\r\nthen termed _marls_, but this name is misleading as they contain no\r\nappreciable proportion of finely divided calcium carbonate as do the\r\ntrue marls[8].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Readers desiring more detailed information on the\r\noccurrence of the clays mentioned in this chapter should refer to the\r\nauthor's _British Clays_ (No. 2 in Bibliography).]\r\n\r\nThe clays in the =Carboniferous Limestone= are not, as a whole, of much\r\nimportance, but the occurrence in this formation of pockets of white\r\nrefractory clays in Staffordshire, North Wales (Mold) and Derbyshire is\r\ninteresting, especially as these are used for the manufacture of\r\nfirebricks and furnace linings. These clays are highly silicious and in\r\ncomposition are intermediate between the Yorkshire fireclays and\r\nganister. Their origin is uncertain, but it is generally considered that\r\nthey have been produced by the action of the weather and streams on the\r\nshales and grits of the Coal Measures which formerly occupied the higher\r\nground around them, though Maw (16) states that 'it is scarcely open to\r\nquestion that they are the remnants of the subaerial dissolution of the\r\nlimestone' (see 'Fireclays,' Chapter V).\r\n\r\nIn the =Upper Carboniferous System= the clays are highly important\r\nbecause of their general refractory nature, though they differ greatly\r\nin this respect, some red-burning shales of this formation having no\r\ngreater power to resist heat than have some of the surface clays.\r\n\r\nThose of the Coal Measures are of two main kinds--shales, or laminated\r\nrocks which readily split along the planes of deposition, and\r\nunstratified underclays. The _shales_ usually occur above the seams of\r\ncoal and are either of lacustrine or marine origin, differences in their\r\nfossils and lithological character supporting one origin for some\r\ndeposits and the other for the remainder. Some of them are fairly\r\nuniform in composition, but others vary so greatly in their physical\r\ncharacters, that they are divided by miners into 'binds' or relatively\r\npure shales, 'rock-binds,' or sandy shales, and sandstones. They also\r\nvary greatly in thickness in different localities, and whilst they form\r\nthe main feature in some districts, in others they are replaced by\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\nThe _underclays_ are so called from their usually lying beneath the coal\r\nseams. They are not noticeably stratified and vary greatly in character\r\nfrom soft unctuous materials to hard, sandy rocks. In composition they\r\nvary enormously, the percentage of silica ranging from 50 per cent., or\r\nless, to as high as 97 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe mode of formation of the underclays is not certainly known. They do\r\nnot appear to be soils or of terrestrial origin, but according to Arber\r\n(24) correspond closely to the black oozes of marine and semi-marine\r\nestuarine deposits of tropical swamps, or to the muds surrounding the\r\nstumps of trees in the buried forests of our coast-lines. They thus\r\nappear to be quite distinct from the shales above them, both in origin\r\nand physical characters. The more silicious portions, known as\r\n_Ganister_[9], possess comparatively few of the characteristics of clay\r\nthough used, like all the more refractory clays of the Coal Measures,\r\nfor all purposes for which fireclay is employed. The term _fireclay_ is,\r\nin fact, frequently applied to all the refractory deposits in the Coal\r\nMeasures, without much regard to their composition (see Chapter V).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Dinas rock used in the Vale of Neath (Wales) is an even\r\nmore silicious material found in the Millstone Grit immediately below\r\nthe Coal Measures. It is largely employed for firebricks.]\r\n\r\nValuable Coal Measure clays occur in enormous quantities in\r\nNorthumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire,\r\nStaffordshire, near Stourbridge, in Warwickshire, Shropshire, North and\r\nSouth Wales and South West Scotland. In Ireland, on the contrary, the\r\nCoal Measure clays are of little value except in the neighbourhood of\r\nCoal Island, co. Tyrone. The position of the 'Sagger Marls' of North\r\nStaffordshire (Keele Series and Etruria Marls), relative to the\r\n'Farewell Rock' or Millstone Grit, is shown in fig. 8 in which the\r\nhorizontal lines represent coal-seams and ironstone veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                     +---------------------+\r\n                     |    _Keele Series_   |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     +---------------------+ Newcastle\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     +---------------------+ Coal\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |      _Etruria       |\r\n                     |         Marls_      |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n  Top Red Mine       +---------------------+\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n  Gubbin Ironstone   +---------------------+\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     +---------------------+ Knowles Coal\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n  Burnwood Ironstone +---------------------+\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     |                     |\r\n                     +---------------------+ Mossfield Coal\r\n                     +---------------------+ 5 ft.

Coal Measures sequence in North Staffordshire.]\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarities in the fossils of the Coal Measure clays and shales\r\nin the Northern and Southern Hemispheres suggest that there is a\r\nconsiderable difference in their formation, but the number of clays and\r\nshales which have been examined is too small for any accurate conclusion\r\nto be drawn.\r\n\r\nFor many industrial purposes, particularly for the manufacture of\r\nrefractory goods, the clays and shales of the Carboniferous System are\r\nhighly important. The less valuable burn to a reddish colour, often\r\nspoiled with many grey spots of ferrous silicate derived from the\r\npyrites in the clay, but the purer varieties burn to a delicate primrose\r\nor pale buff tint and are amongst the most heat-resisting materials\r\nknown. The Coal Measure clays of Yorkshire are particularly esteemed for\r\ntheir refractory properties; for the manufacture of glazed bricks and\r\nfor blocks for architectural purposes somewhat ambiguously termed\r\n'glazed terra-cotta.' The inferior qualities are largely used for the\r\nmanufacture of red engineering bricks, some of them competing\r\nsuccessfully with the more widely known 'blue bricks' of Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nThe Coal Measure clays of Shropshire are noted for the manufacture of\r\nred roofing tiles, especially in the neighbourhood of Broseley.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Coal Measure clays are usually poor, but are\r\noccasionally of good quality. The shales produce heavy, cold clays and\r\nthe yellow subsoil produces soils of a light, hungry character so that\r\nthe two should, if possible, be mixed together.\r\n\r\n=Permian clays= are of little value except for the manufacture of red\r\nbuilding bricks. The Nottinghamshire Permian clays make excellent\r\nroofing tiles, flower pots and red bricks.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Permian clays are a free working loam yielding large\r\ncrops of most of the ordinary farm products.\r\n\r\n=Triassic clays= are of great importance in the Midlands, those upper\r\nportions of them known as the Keuper Marls being much used for the\r\nmanufacture of bricks.\r\n\r\nThey are specially known amongst clayworkers as the material from which\r\nthe Midland red bricks of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire and the\r\nSomersetshire tiles are prepared.\r\n\r\n=Jurassic clays= are an important group, of marine origin, occurring in\r\nclose association with limestone. For this reason they form a valuable\r\nsource of material for the manufacture of Portland cement, but are of\r\nless value to the brick and tile manufacturer. The Jurassic System\r\ncontains so large a variety of clays, of such widely different ages and\r\ncharacteristics, that no general description of them can be given in the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Lias clay being worked for the manufacture of\r\nhand-made sand-faced roofing tiles. (_By courtesy of Messrs Webb Bros.\r\nLtd., Cheltenham._)]\r\n\r\nThe '_Lias clays_'--the lowest of the Jurassic formation--are chiefly\r\ndark, bituminous shales, including the 'alum shales,' and are often\r\nseriously contaminated with pyrites and ironstone. When carefully\r\nselected they may be used to advantage in the production of most red\r\narticles such as bricks, tiles, chimney pots, etc. They shrink less in\r\nthe kiln than do most clays, and are easily fusible on account of the\r\nlime they contain, but on the whole this formation is of great value for\r\nthe manufacture of the articles just mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Lias clays are laid down for grass, but the lighter\r\nsoils are useful for arable purposes.\r\n\r\nThe '_Oolitic clays_,' which are also Jurassic, usually contain\r\nlimestone in the form of nodules, but are nevertheless important. They\r\nform a broad belt above the Lias from Dorset to Yorkshire, and include\r\nthe blue clays of the Purbeck beds, stiff blue bituminous Kimeridge\r\nclays, the irregular, sandy Coral Rag clays, the famous Oxford clay\r\n(from which the Peterborough and Fletton bricks are made), the Kellaways\r\nblue clay, and the Fuller's Earth deposits.\r\n\r\nThe '_Kimeridge clays_' are dark, stiff laminated clays, closely\r\nresembling gault, and are much used in the West and Midlands for\r\nbrickmaking. A well-known deposit of this character has long been used\r\nat Pickering in Yorkshire, but the most typical deposits are in\r\nHuntingdonshire. The Kimeridge clays contain a bituminous shale, or\r\nSapropelic Coal, which evolves a characteristic odour on burning.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Kimeridge clays resemble gault and are difficult to\r\nwork as arable land, though they form first-rate pasturage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Oxford clay near Peterborough. (_By courtesy of\r\nMessrs Ruston, Proctor & Co. Ltd._)]\r\n\r\nThe '_Oxford clays_' are valuable for brickmaking when their use is\r\nunderstood, but to the uninitiated they are very troublesome. Their\r\ncolour is dark blue or grey and they are usually stiff or somewhat shaly\r\nin texture with layers of variable composition. The closely associated\r\nCornbrash (limestone) is a source of trouble unless great care is taken\r\nin the selection of the material. 'Oxford clays' are not infrequently\r\ntraversed by seams of poor coal or by oil-shales.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, Oxford clay is difficult to work and, while much of it\r\nis valuable, large portions are poor and cold. When well exposed to\r\nfrost it is made much lighter, but even then is not very suitable for\r\nwheat and autumn sown crops.\r\n\r\nThe '_Kellaway blue clays_' are often included in the Oxford clays,\r\nthough they form irregular bands above them and are of fresh-water\r\norigin, whilst the Oxford clays are marine deposits. They are chiefly\r\nused commercially for domestic firebricks near Oundle and Stamford.\r\n\r\n=Cretaceous clays= occur, as their name implies, in association with\r\nchalk. The chief clay in this System is the _gault_, a stiff, black,\r\ncalcareous clay of marine origin chiefly used for brickmaking. When used\r\nalone, gault burns to a reddish colour, due to the iron present, but if,\r\nas is more usual, it is mixed with chalk, it burns perfectly white. Some\r\ngaults contain sufficient chalk to render the addition of a further\r\nquantity unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Cretaceous clays form good arable soil where they\r\nare not too exposed, but they suffer from drought.\r\n\r\nThe '_Wealden clay_' is a stiff yellowish grey or blue clay extensively\r\nused for brickmaking in Kent, Sussex and Surrey. It has been subdivided\r\nby geologists into a number of other clays, such as the Wadhurst,\r\nFairlight, etc., but the differences between them lie more in the\r\nfossils occurring in them than in the characters of the clays\r\nthemselves. They are usually contaminated with ironstone, gypsum and\r\nsome limestone.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the Wealden clay produces stiff, yellowish soils of a\r\nwet and poor character, but sometimes loams of a highly productive\r\nnature occur.\r\n\r\nThe =Tertiary clays= include all those deposited after the Chalk and\r\nprevious to the close of the Glacial period. They are usually mixed with\r\nsand and gravel, and though the deposits are often thin and irregular\r\nthey are the most generally important of all clays. They vary greatly in\r\ncharacter; some, like the London clay, being almost useless unless mixed\r\nwith other materials, whilst others like the ball clays of Devonshire\r\nand Dorset are amongst the purest and most valuable of the plastic\r\nclays. The Tertiary clays are divided by geologists into Pliocene,\r\nMiocene and Eocene formations; of these the first are commercially\r\nunimportant and the second do not exist in Great Britain. At one time\r\nthe Bovey Tracey clays were considered to be Miocene, but they have\r\nrecently been classed as Oligocene by Clement Reid.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, the most important of the Tertiary formations is the\r\nEocene, particularly near London, though it is much covered by sand or\r\ngravel. The _London clay_, which produces a heavy brown soil, is of\r\nslight value, though when properly drained it produces good crops of\r\nwheat, beans, and cabbages and other market-garden produce. For this\r\npurpose it is greatly improved by the addition of lime and of town\r\nmanure. The South Hampshire Eocene beds of clay are cold, wet and of\r\nsmall agricultural value.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene clays are composed of a variety of clays, many of which are\r\nonly distinguishable by the different fossils they contain. The most\r\nimportant are the Reading clays, the London clay and the Bagshot clays.\r\n\r\nThe _Reading clays_ extend over a considerable area in the South of\r\nEngland and are most valuable near the town from which they derive their\r\nname. The best qualities are mottled in a characteristic manner and are\r\nparticularly suitable for the manufacture of roofing tiles and small\r\nterra-cotta--an industry for which Reading is famous.\r\n\r\nThe _London clay_ is always a treacherous material and is best avoided\r\nin the manufacture of bricks and other articles except under highly\r\nskilled technical advice.\r\n\r\nThe _Bagshot clays_ in Dorsetshire are famous for the ball and pipe\r\nclays shipped from Poole, whilst at Bovey Tracey and in several parts of\r\nDevonshire equally valuable ball clays are found and are shipped from\r\nTeignmouth.\r\n\r\nThese _ball clays_ are of variable composition and colour and require\r\ncareful selection and testing. They are closely associated with sands,\r\nbut the lower beds of clay are remarkably stiff, plastic and\r\nwhite-burning. The colour of the raw clay varies from a pale yellow to a\r\ndark brown or even to black, but this is little or no criterion of the\r\ncolour of goods made therefrom, as the colour is due to carbonaceous\r\nmatters, 4 per cent. or more carbon being usually present.\r\n\r\nThe 'blue' and 'black' ball clays are the most valued by potters, but\r\nthe quality is usually ascertained by a burning test.\r\n\r\nThe value of these ball clays both in Devonshire and Dorset is due to\r\ntheir comparative freedom from iron and alkalies and to their remarkable\r\nunctuousness and plasticity. They are, therefore, largely used in the\r\nmanufacture of all kinds of earthenware of which they form the\r\nfoundation material.\r\n\r\nIn composition, ball clays appear to consist chiefly of a\r\nhydro-alumino-silicate corresponding to the formula H4Al2Si2O9,\r\nand in this they very closely resemble the china clays (kaolins). The\r\nlatter are, however, but slightly plastic whilst the ball clays are\r\namongst the most plastic clays known. The china clays are also much more\r\nrefractory than the ball clays owing to the somewhat larger proportion\r\nof alkalies in the latter.\r\n\r\n_Pipe clays_ are an inferior quality of ball clay; they contain rather\r\nmore iron and alkalies and considerably more silica. For this reason\r\nthey can only be used for cheaper wares where colour is of less\r\nimportance and where their excessive contraction can be neutralized by\r\nthe addition of other substances such as flint.\r\n\r\nThe =Boulder clays= occur in a blanket-like covering of Drift which lies\r\nover the greater part of Northern and Central England, and over a\r\nconsiderable portion of Scotland and Ireland. They are a product of the\r\nIce Age and, whilst varying greatly in character, may usually be\r\ndistinguished by the occurrence in them of rounded stones and gravel,\r\nsome of the former bearing clear indications of glacial action. The\r\nboulder clays are largely used for the manufacture of building bricks,\r\nbut the strata in which they occur are so irregular that very careful\r\nsupervision of the digging is necessary. In some localities these clays\r\nform beds 12 ft. or more in thickness and relatively free from gravel;\r\nin other districts the clay is interspersed with lenticular deposits of\r\ngravel or sand (commonly known as 'pockets'), and if these are mixed\r\nwith the clay considerable difficulty in manufacture may be experienced.\r\nThe total thickness of the drift deposits is often very great, as in\r\nthe cliffs at Filey (fig. 11) which are 200 ft. high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Cliffs of Boulder clay at Filey lying on\r\nCalcareous Crag.]\r\n\r\nThe boulder clays--considered apart from the stones, gravel and sandy\r\nmaterials occurring with them--are usually red-burning, stiff and very\r\nplastic, but the gravel, sand and crushed stones mixed with them in the\r\nformation of the material usually render them of medium plasticity. By\r\ncareful washing, most boulder clays may be purified sufficiently to\r\nenable coarse brown pottery to be made from them. Clean deposits of\r\nsufficient size to be worked without any purification are occasionally\r\nfound. Usually, however, the boulder clay formation is somewhat\r\ntreacherous as it is difficult to ascertain its nature; boreholes are\r\napt to be quite misleading as the formation is so irregular in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, drift or boulder clays are poor soils, but by judicious\r\nmanagement and careful mixing they may be made more fertile. Where it\r\ncontains chalk--as in Norfolk and Suffolk--boulder drift forms an\r\nexcellent arable soil.\r\n\r\n=Pleistocene or Recent clays= are amongst the most important brickmaking\r\nmaterials in the South of England. They are of remarkably varied\r\ncharacter, having been derived from a number of other formations.\r\nUsually the deposits are somewhat shallow and irregular in form, but\r\nbeds of considerable thickness occur in some localities.\r\n\r\nAgriculturally, they are of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nMost of the =brick earths= used in the south-east of England are of\r\nRecent formation, those of the Thames Valley being of special importance\r\nin this connection, particularly where they are associated with chalk;\r\nthus forming natural _marls_ or enabling artificial marls to be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe brick earths--in the sense in which this term is used in the\r\nsouth--comprise three important types of clay: (_a_) _Plastic clays_ not\r\nparticularly differentiated from those already described, (_b_) _Loams_\r\nor sandy clays which are sufficiently plastic for satisfactory use, have\r\nthe advantage of shrinking but slightly in drying, and are largely used\r\nin the manufacture of red facing bricks and as light soils, and (_c_)\r\n_Marls_ or calcareous clays, used for the production of light coloured\r\nor white bricks, the chalk they contain combining with any iron\r\ncompounds present and, at the same time, reducing the contractility of\r\nthe clay. On burning, they form a cement which binds the particles into\r\na strong mass. These are the 'true marls' or 'malms' composed of clay\r\nand chalk and must not be confused with the so-called marls of\r\nStaffordshire and elsewhere which are almost free from lime compounds.\r\nThere is, at present, no definition of 'marl' which is quite\r\nsatisfactory; a maker of London stock bricks understanding by this term\r\na clay containing at least 10 per cent. of chalk; a maker of white\r\nSuffolk bricks a material containing at least twice this amount; an\r\nagriculturalist any soil, not obviously sandy, which will make his clay\r\nland less sticky; and many geologists any friable argillaceous earths. A\r\ngeneral consensus of opinion is, however, being gradually reached that\r\nthe term 'marl' should be limited, as far as possible, to clays\r\ncontaining calcium carbonate in a finely divided state.\r\n\r\n=Alluvial deposits=--which are also of Recent formation, though still of\r\nsufficient age for skeletons of mammoths to be found in them--are of so\r\nvariable a nature as to render any brief, general description\r\nimpossible. Many of them are so contaminated with sand and crushed\r\nlimestone as to be useless for manufacturing purposes and of small value\r\nagriculturally, but others are important in both these respects.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the occurrence of clays in the various formations\r\ndescribed will be found in the _Maps and Memoirs of the Geological\r\nSurvey_ and in the author's _British Clays_ (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINS OF CLAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms 'primary' and 'residual' are applied to those clays which are\r\nfound overlying or in close association with the rocks from which they\r\nhave been derived, and distinguish them from the 'secondary' or\r\n'transported' clays which have been carried some distance away from\r\ntheir place of origin.\r\n\r\n=Residual clays= may be formed by the simple removal of other materials,\r\nthe clay remaining behind, as in the decomposition of some argillaceous\r\nlimestones, in which the calcareous matter has been removed by solution\r\nwhilst the clay is unaffected. Such a clay is not a primary one as it\r\nhas probably been derived from some distant source and, having been\r\ndeposited along with the limestone ooze, has formed an intimate mixture\r\nfrom which the limestone has, at a later geological epoch, been removed\r\nin the manner indicated. Residual clays are seldom pure, being often\r\nrich in iron compounds, though the white clays of Staffordshire and\r\nDerbyshire are highly refractory.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom necessary to distinguish residual clays from other\r\nsecondary or transported ones (Chapters II and IV).\r\n\r\n=Primary clays=, on the contrary, have been derived from rocks which\r\nhave undergone chemical decomposition, one of the products being clay.\r\nThe most important primary clays are the kaolins, which are derived from\r\nthe decomposition of felspar, but other primary clays derived from other\r\nminerals are known, though less frequently mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe _kaolins_ are primary clays[10] formed by the decomposition of\r\nfelspar and occur in many parts of the world. In Great Britain the most\r\nimportant are the china clays found in Devon and Cornwall, which occur\r\nin association with the granite from which they have been formed. The\r\nkaolins in Germany are, apparently, of similar origin, though some are\r\nderived from porphyry and not from granite; they are the chief material\r\nused in the manufacture of Dresden, Meissen, Berlin and other\r\nporcelains. The French kaolins from St Yrieux and Limousin are said by\r\nGranger (17) to be derived from gneiss amphibole. The American kaolins\r\nhave, according to Ries (6), been chiefly formed from the weathering of\r\npegmatite veins, but the origin of some important deposits in Texas and\r\nIndiana has not yet been fully explained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Some kaolins in central Europe appear to have been\r\ntransported and of secondary origin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. China clay pit belonging to the North Cornwall\r\nChina Clay Co. (_By courtesy of W. H. Patchell Esq._)]\r\n\r\nThe corresponding material used by the Chinese for the manufacture of\r\nporcelain bears a name which is really that of the place from whence it\r\nwas originally obtained; the term _Kao-ling_ indicates merely a high\r\nridge. According to Richthofen (18) the rock from which Chinese\r\nporcelain is made is not a true kaolin, but is allied to the _jades_.\r\nThe term 'kaolin' is therefore a misnomer when applied to white-burning,\r\nprimary clays generally, but its use has become so firmly established as\r\nto render it permanent.\r\n\r\nKaolins are seldom found in a sufficiently pure state to be used direct,\r\nbut must be freed from large amounts of undecomposed rock, quartz, mica,\r\netc., by a process of washing and sedimentation. When purified in this\r\nmanner, the best qualities of china clay yield, on analysis, alumina,\r\nsilica and water in the proportions indicated by the formula\r\nH4Al2Si2O9 together with about 5 per cent. of mica and other\r\nimpurities. Some high class commercial kaolins contain over 30 per cent.\r\nof mica and 10 per cent. of quartz.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of rocks which take part in the production of\r\nkaolins appear to be the felspars, but the natural processes by which\r\nthese felspars are decomposed are by no means perfectly understood. Some\r\nkaolins appear to have been formed by weathering and others by subaerial\r\naction. Thus Collins (19) has stated very emphatically that the\r\nkaolinization of Cornish felspar has been chiefly effected by fluorine\r\nand other substances rising from below and not by carbonic acid and\r\nwater acting from above. Ries (6) and other American observers are\r\nequally convinced that certain kaolins they have examined are the result\r\nof 'weathering.' German and French investigators are divided in their\r\nopinions, and Fuchs has found that the Passau (Saxony) kaolin is derived\r\nfrom a special mineral, not unlike a soda-lime felspar deficient in\r\nsilica, to which he has given the name 'porcelain spar.'\r\n\r\nThe _felspars_ form a class of minerals whose chief characteristic is\r\nthe combination of an alkaline or alkaline-earth base with silica and\r\nalumina. Orthoclase (K2OAl2O3·6SiO2)--the chief potassium\r\nfelspar--is typical of the whole class. When treated with water under\r\nsuitable conditions, the felspar appears to become hydrolysed and some\r\nof the water enters into combination, the potash being removed by\r\nsolution. Attempts to effect this decomposition artificially have proved\r\nabortive though several investigators appear to have effected it to a\r\nlimited extent by electrolysis or by heating under great pressure (3).\r\n\r\nThe effect on felspars of waters containing carbon dioxide in solution\r\nhas been studied by Forschammer, Vogt, and others, and they have\r\nconcluded that kaolinization may occur with this agent though it does\r\nnot appear to be the chief cause in the formation of Cornish china\r\nclays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Orthoclase Felspar, natural size. (_From Miers_'\r\nMineralogy _by permission of Macmillan & Co._)]\r\n\r\nThe probable effect of fluoric vapours has been studied by Collins (19)\r\nwho confirmed von Buch's observation that fluorides (particularly\r\nlepidolite and tourmaline) are constantly associated with china clay; he\r\nfound by direct experiment that felspar is decomposed by hydrofluoric\r\nacid at the ordinary temperature without the other constituents of the\r\ngranite in which it occurs being affected. This theory is confirmed by\r\nthe great depths of the kaolin deposits in Cornwall and in Zettlitz\r\n(Bohemia) which appear to be too great to render satisfactory any theory\r\nof simple weathering though kaolins in other localities, especially in\r\nAmerica, appear to be largely the result of weathering. According to\r\nHickling (36) the product of the action of hydrofluoric acid 'has not\r\nthe remotest resemblance to china clay.'\r\n\r\nKaolin, when carefully freed from its impurities, as far as this is\r\npossible, is peculiarly resistant to the action of water. This\r\nresistance may be due to its highly complex constitution, as the simpler\r\nhydro-alumino-silicates, such as collyrite, show an acid reaction when\r\nground with water. Rohland (5), therefore, suggests that kaolinization\r\nis effected by water first hydrolysing the felspar and forming colloidal\r\nsilica and sodium or potassium hydroxides which are removed whilst the\r\ncomplex alumino-silicate remains in the form of kaolin. Hickling (36),\r\non the contrary, believes that the action of the weather on felspar\r\nproduces secondary muscovite--a form of mica--and that this is, later,\r\nconverted into kaolinite or china clay (fig. 17, p. 105).\r\n\r\nThe various theories which have been propounded may be summarized into\r\nthree main classes, and whilst it is probable that any one of them, or\r\nany one combination, may be true for a particular kaolin, yet the whole\r\nprocess of kaolinization is so complex and the conditions under which it\r\nhas occurred appear to be so diverse that it is doubtful if any simple\r\ntheory can be devised which will satisfactorily meet all cases.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The decomposition of the granite, and particularly of the felspar\r\nwithin it, may be ascribed to purely chemical reactions in which the\r\nchief agents are water and carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Other substances--possibly of an organic nature and derived from\r\nthe soil--may have played an important part.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Wet steam and hot solutions of fluorine, boron or sulphur\r\ncompounds may have effected the decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe recent progress made in the application of the laws of physical\r\nchemistry to geological problems is continually throwing fresh light on\r\nthis interesting subject. Thus, studies of the dissociation pressures\r\nand transition points between the anhydrous and the hydrous states of\r\nvarious substances and the effect of water as a powerful agent of\r\ndecomposition (hydrolysis) have shown that hydration is a\r\ncharacteristic result of decompositions occurring in the upper portions\r\nof the earth's crust and not in the lower ones, and that it is usually\r\nchecked, or even reversed, when the substance is under great pressure.\r\nAt great depths kaolins and other complex hydrous silicates give place\r\nto anhydrous ones such as muscovite, andalusite and staurolite. There\r\nis, therefore, good reason to believe that the kaolinization of Cornish\r\nfelspar has occurred at only moderate depths from the surface and that\r\nit has been chiefly produced by the action of water containing acid\r\ngases in solution. The acid in the water may have been absorbed from the\r\natmosphere, or it may be due to vapours rising from below through the\r\nfelspathic material.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, china clay occurs in the form of powdery particles\r\napparently amorphous, but containing some crystals, scattered through a\r\nmass of harder rock, the whole being known as china clay rock or\r\n'carclazite.' The softer portions of this china clay rock are known as\r\n'growan' and the china clay in it represents only a small proportion of\r\nthe whole material.\r\n\r\nThe finer particles of clay and other materials are removed by treatment\r\nwith water, whereby one-third to one-eighth of the material is\r\nseparated. This small proportion is then subjected to further washing\r\nand sedimentation in order to obtain the china clay in a state of\r\ncommercial purity. It will thus be understood that the Cornish china\r\nclays are not 'deposits' in the usual acceptation of that term, the soft\r\ngrowan from which they are obtained being almost invariably the result\r\nof decomposition _in situ_ of some species of felspar in disintegrated\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThe commercial kaolins of France, Germany, America and China very\r\nclosely resemble the Cornish china clays in composition, but when used\r\nin the manufacture of porcelain they create differences in the finished\r\nmaterial which are clearly noticeable, though microscopical examination\r\nand chemical analysis, at present, fail to distinguish between them in\r\nthe raw state on account of their great resistance to ordinary chemical\r\nand physical forces.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the breaking up of felspathic rocks with the formation of\r\nchina clay or kaolin (kaolinization), other decompositions which occur\r\nmay result in the formation of clays, and an examination of a\r\nconsiderable number of clays by J. M. van Bemmelen (26) has led him to\r\nsuppose that several different clay-forming forces have been at work in\r\nthe production of clays. He classifies these under four heads:\r\n\r\n(1) _Kaolinization_, or the decomposition of felspathic and similar\r\nrocks by the action of telluric water containing active gases in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ordinary weathering_ in which the action is largely mechanical, but\r\nis accompanied by some hydrolysis owing to the impurities contained in\r\nthe water which is an essential factor.\r\n\r\n(3) _Lateritic action_--or simple decomposition by heat--which occurs\r\nchiefly under tropical conditions, but may also occur in temperate\r\nclimates, and has for its main product a mixture of free silica and\r\nalumina, the latter being in the form of (amorphous) 'laterite.' It may\r\nnot improbably be a result of the decomposition of the clay molecule\r\nsimilar to that which occurs when china clay is heated, as there is no\r\ntemperature below which it can be said that china clay does not\r\ndecompose into free silica and alumina (29).\r\n\r\n(4) _Secondary reactions_ in which the products of one of the reactions\r\npreviously described may undergo further changes, as the conversion of\r\namorphous clayite into crystalline kaolinite, or amorphous laterite into\r\ncrystalline hydrargillite.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeathering.\r\n\r\nThe action of the forces conveniently classed under the term\r\n_weathering_ are of two main kinds:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _mechanical grinding_ of sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and\r\nother rocks, causes an addition of adventitious material to clay, the\r\nproportions being sometimes so large as to render it necessary to term\r\nthe material an argillaceous sand, rather than a sandy clay. Some of\r\nthese grains of mineral matter are so minute and so resistant to the\r\nordinary chemical reagents as to make it extremely difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from clay.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _chemical decomposition_ due to the action of very dilute\r\nsolutions. By this means simple silicates are decomposed with the\r\nformation of colloidal silica which may either remain in solution or may\r\nbe deposited in a coagulated form. At the same time, some\r\nalumino-silicates will be similarly decomposed into colloidal\r\nalumino-silicic acids or clays.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate results of the action of ordinary weathering on silicate\r\nrocks are, therefore, sands and clays, the latter being in some ways\r\nquite distinct in their origin and physical properties from the china\r\nclays. According to J. M. van Bemmelen (26) such clays also contain an\r\nalumino-silicate soluble in boiling hydrochloric acid followed by\r\ncaustic soda, whereas pure china clays are unaffected by this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe variety of silicates and other minerals which--in a partially\r\ndecomposed condition--go to form 'clays' is so great that the complete\r\nseparation of the smallest particles of them from those of the true clay\r\npresent has never been accomplished and our knowledge of the\r\nmineralogical constitution of many of the best known clays is far from\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the action of water does not cease with the\r\nformation of clay, but that it slowly effects an increase in the\r\nplasticity of the clay. There thus appear to be at least three kinds of\r\nprimary clay, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Kaolinic_ or _china clays_ which are chiefly derived from felspar and\r\ncan be isolated in a relatively pure state. They are highly refractory,\r\nbut only slightly plastic.\r\n\r\n_Epigenic_ or _colloidal clays_ derived from kaolinic clays, as a\r\nsecondary product, or directly from felspar, mica, augite and other\r\nalumino-silicates by 'weathering.' They are usually less refractory and\r\nmuch more plastic than the china clays and contain a large percentage of\r\nimpurities--sometimes in the form of free silica (sand) or of metallic\r\noxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, silicates, or other compounds.\r\nMany so-called secondary clays such as pipe clays, ball clays and\r\nfireclays may be of this type, though their origin is difficult to trace\r\nowing to their subsequent transportation and deposition.\r\n\r\n_Lateritic_ or _highly aluminous clays_, of a highly refractory\r\ncharacter, but low plasticity. They are usually somewhat rich in iron\r\noxide which materially affects their plasticity. Unlike the china clays,\r\npure lateritic clays are completely decomposed by hydrochloric acid.\r\nBauxite and some of the highly aluminous clays of the Coal Measures\r\nappear to be of this type.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these different types of clay are extremely difficult to\r\ndistinguish and in many instances they have become mixed with each other\r\nand with other materials during the actions to be described in the next\r\nchapter, that it is often almost impossible to decide whether the true\r\nclay in a given specimen possessed its characteristics _ab initio_ or\r\nwhether it has gained them since the time when it ceased to be a primary\r\nclay.\r\n\r\n=Secondary clays= are those which have been produced by the action of\r\nthe weather and other natural forces on primary clays, the changes\r\neffected being of a physical rather than a chemical nature (see Chapter\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nThe essential constituent of secondary clays has not been positively\r\nidentified. In so far as it has been isolated it differs from the true\r\nclay in the primary clays in several important respects, and until its\r\nnature has been more fully investigated great caution must be exercised\r\nin assigning a definite name to it. For many purposes the term\r\n_pelinite_ (p. 149) is convenient, being analogous to the corresponding\r\none used for material in china clays (_clayite_, p. 107). These terms\r\nare purely provisional and must be discarded when the true mineralogical\r\nidentities of the substances they represent have been established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MODES OF ACCUMULATION OF CLAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whatever sources clays may have been originally derived, the manner\r\nin which they have been accumulated in their present positions is a\r\nfactor of great importance both in regard to their chemical and physical\r\ncharacters and their suitability for various purposes.\r\n\r\nAs explained in Chapter III, the china clays or kaolins may usually be\r\nregarded as primary clays derived from granitic or other felspathic or\r\nfelsitic rocks by chemical decomposition. Such clays are found near to\r\ntheir place of origin, are usually obtainable in a comparatively pure\r\nstate and are generally deficient in plasticity. They may occur in beds\r\nof small or great depth, but these are not 'accumulations' in the\r\nordinary meaning of that term.\r\n\r\nResidual clays (p. 70) also form a distinct class, as unlike the\r\nmajority of argillaceous materials they are left behind when other\r\nsubstances are removed, usually by some process of solution. In many\r\ncases, however, the residual clays are really secondary in character,\r\nhaving been transported from their place of origin, together with\r\nlimestone or other minerals, the mixture deposited and subjected to\r\npressure and possibly to heat, whereby a rock-like mass is formed. This\r\nmass has then been subjected to the solvent action of water containing\r\ncarbon dioxide or other substances which dissolve out the bulk of the\r\nassociated minerals and leave the residual clay behind.\r\n\r\nThe chief agents in the transport and accumulation of clays are the\r\n_air_, in the form of wind; _water_, in the form of rain, streams,\r\nrivers, floods, lakes and seas, or in the form of ice and snow as in\r\nglaciers and avalanches; _earth-movements_ such as the changes wrought\r\nby volcanoes, earthquakes and the less clearly marked rising and falling\r\nof various portions of the earth's crust which result in folded,\r\ntwisted, sheared, cracked, inclined, laminated and other strata.\r\n\r\nThese agents have first moved the clay from its original site and have\r\nlater deposited it with other materials in the form of strata of widely\r\nvarying area and thickness, some 'clay' beds being several hundred feet\r\nin depth and occupying many square miles in area, whilst others are in\r\nthe form of thin 'veins' only a few inches thick or in 'pockets' of\r\nsmall area and depth. These deposits have in many places been displaced\r\nby subsequent earth-movements and have been overlain by other deposits\r\nso as to render them quite inaccessible. Others have been covered by\r\ndeposits several miles thick; but the greater part of the covering has\r\nsince been removed by glacial or other forces, so that clays of\r\npractically all geological ages may be found within the relatively small\r\narea of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transportation of Clays.\r\n\r\nBy the action of wind or rain, or of rain following frost, the finer of\r\nparticles clay are removed from their primary site and as the rain drops\r\ncollect into streamlets, these unite to form streams and rivers and the\r\nclay with its associated minerals is carried along by the water. As it\r\ntravels over other rocks or through valleys composed of sandstone,\r\nlimestone and other materials, some of these substances are dislodged,\r\nbroken into fragments of various sizes and with the clay are carried\r\nstill further. In their journey these materials rub against each other\r\nand against the banks and bed of the stream, thereby undergoing a\r\nprolonged process of grinding whereby the softer rocks are reduced to\r\nvery fine sand and silt which becomes, in time, very intimately mixed\r\nwith the clay. If the velocity of the stream were sufficiently great,\r\nthe mixed materials--derived from as many sources as there are rocks of\r\nthe districts through which they have passed--would be discharged into a\r\nlake or into the sea. Here the velocity of the water would be so greatly\r\nreduced that the materials would gradually settle, the largest and\r\nheaviest fragments being first deposited and the finer ones at a greater\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWith most streams and rivers, however, the velocity of the water is very\r\nvariable, and a certain amount of deposition therefore occurs along the\r\ncourse, the heavier particles only travelling a short distance, whilst\r\nthe finer ones are readily transported. If the velocity of the stream\r\nincreases, these finer particles (which include the clay) may become\r\nmixed with other particles of various sizes and the materials thus\r\nundergo a series of mixings and partial sortings until they are\r\ndischarged at the river mouth or are left along its sides by a gradual\r\nsinking of the water level. The clay will be carried the whole course of\r\nthe river, unless it is deposited at some place where the velocity of\r\nthe water is reduced sufficiently to permit it to settle.\r\n\r\nIf floods arise, the area affected by the water will be increased. The\r\n_alluvial clays_ have, apparently, been formed by overflowing streams\r\nand rivers, the material in suspension in the water being deposited as\r\nthe rate of flow diminished. Such alluvial deposits contain a variety of\r\nminerals--usually in a very finely divided state--clay, limestone-dust\r\nor chalk, and sand being those most usually found.\r\n\r\n_River-deposited clays_, _i.e._, those which have accumulated along the\r\nbanks, are characterized by their irregularity in thickness, their\r\nvariable composition and the extent to which various materials are mixed\r\ntogether. This renders them difficult to work and greatly increases the\r\nrisks of manufacture as the whole character of a fluviatile clay may\r\nchange completely in the course of a few yards.\r\n\r\nAccording to the districts traversed by the water, the extent to which\r\nthe materials have been deposited and re-transported and the fresh\r\nmaterials introduced by earth-movements, river-deposited clays may be\r\n(_a_) _plastic_ and sufficiently pure to be classified as 'clays,' (_b_)\r\n_marls_ or clays containing limestone-dust or chalk thoroughly mixed\r\nwith the clay, and (_c_) _loams_ or clays containing so much sand that\r\nthey may be distinguished by the touch from the clays in class (_a_).\r\nIntermediate to these well-defined classes there are numerous mixtures\r\nbearing compound names such as sandy loams, sandy marls, argillaceous\r\nlimestone, calcareous sands, and calcareous arenaceous clays, to which\r\nno definite characteristics can be assigned.\r\n\r\nTo some extent a transportation of clays and associated materials occurs\r\nin _lakes_, but the chief processes there are of the nature of\r\nsedimentation accompanied by some amount of separation. On the shores\r\nof lakes, and to a much larger extent on the sea coasts, extensive\r\nerosion followed by transportation occurs continuously, enormous\r\nquantities of land being annually removed and deposited in some portion\r\nof the ocean bed. The erosion of cliffs and the corresponding formation\r\nof sand and pebbles are too well known to need further description. It\r\nshould, however, be noticed that the clay particles, being much finer,\r\nare carried so far away from the shore that only pebbles and sand remain\r\nto form the beaches, the finer particles forming 'ocean ooze.'\r\n\r\nThe action of the _sea_ in the transport of rock-materials is more\r\nintense than that of rivers, the coasts being worn away by repeated\r\nblows from the waves and the pebbles and sand grains the latter contain.\r\nThe ocean currents carry the materials dislodged by the waves and\r\ntransport them, sometimes to enormous distances, usually allowing a\r\nconsiderable amount of separation to take place during the transit. In\r\nthis way they act in a similar manner to rivers and streams.\r\n\r\n_Glaciers_ may be regarded as rivers of ice which erode their banks and\r\nbed in a manner similar to, but more rapidly than, streams of water.\r\nOwing to their much greater viscosity, glaciers are able to carry large\r\nboulders as well as gravel, sand and clay, so that the materials\r\ntransported by them are far more complex in composition and size than\r\nare those carried by flowing water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Illustrating the successive deposition of\r\ndifferent strata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparation and Sedimentation.\r\n\r\nThe clay and other particles having been placed in suspension in water\r\nby one or more of the natural forces already mentioned, they soon\r\nundergo a process of sorting or separation, previous to their\r\ndeposition. The power of water for carrying matter in suspension depends\r\nlargely on its velocity, and when this is reduced, as when a river\r\ndischarges into a lake or sea, the larger and denser particles at once\r\ncommence to settle, the smaller ones remaining longer in suspension,\r\nthough if the velocity of the water is reduced sufficiently all the\r\nparticles will be deposited. Hence, the deposits in lakes (_lacustrine_)\r\nand at the mouths of rivers (_estuarine_) increase more or less\r\nregularly in fineness according to their distance from the point at\r\nwhich the water enters, the gravel and stones being deposited first,\r\nthen the coarse sand, next the finer sand and finally the silt and clay\r\n(fig. 14). If cross-currents are present, the deposits will, naturally,\r\nbe made more irregular, and in some cases variations in the flow of the\r\ntransporting water may cause the coarser particles to be carried further\r\nthan usual so that they may cover some of the finer deposits previously\r\nformed; but as the clay and silt particles are so much finer than sand\r\nand gravel they usually travel so far before settling that their\r\ndeposits are very uniform if the area over which they are spread is\r\nsufficiently large. Lake-deposited clays are for this reason more\r\nuniform than estuarine beds, whilst beds deposited at considerable\r\ndepths in the sea and at a great distance from land are still more\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nA _lacustrine clay_ is usually more persistent and uniform than\r\nfluviatile beds though sometimes difficult to distinguish from the\r\nlatter. Some of the most valuable clay deposits are of lacustrine\r\nformation; their comparative purity and great uniformity enabling ware\r\nof excellent colour and texture to be produced without much difficulty.\r\nThus the Reading mottled clays of the Hampshire basin, on the outskirts\r\nof the London basin and in Northern France are well known for the\r\nadmirable red bricks, tiles and terra-cotta produced from them. Still\r\npurer clays deposited at Bovey Heathfield in Devonshire are also of\r\nlacustrine origin, though they differ in many respects from the ordinary\r\nlake-deposited clays and are of unusual thickness for deposits formed\r\nin this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Lacustrine clay at Skipsea. (_By courtesy of T.\r\nSheppard Esq._)]\r\n\r\nThe greater purity of lacustrine clays, as compared with fluviatile\r\nones, is attributed to the much larger area over which the deposit is\r\nspread,--enabling variations in the deposits to be much less noticeable\r\nthan when a smaller area is covered--and to the very small velocity of\r\nthe water in lakes, whereby all the coarser particles are deposited a\r\nconsiderable distance away from the clays and silts.\r\n\r\nRies (6) has pointed out that many (American) lake-clays are of glacial\r\norigin, having been laid in basins or hollows along the margin of the\r\nice-sheet or in valleys which have been dammed by an accumulation of\r\ndrift across them. Such clay beds are usually surface deposits of\r\nvariable thickness and frequently impure. Like all lacustrine deposits\r\nthey show (though in a more marked degree than in the older and larger\r\nlakes) alternate layers of sand and clay, though the former are usually\r\ntoo thin to be noticeable except for their action in enabling the\r\ndeposited material to be easily split along the lines of bedding.\r\n\r\n_Estuarine deposits_ partake of the nature of both fluviatile and marine\r\nbeds, according to their position relative to the river from which they\r\noriginate. They are usually uncertain in character and are often\r\nirregular in composition owing to the variations in the flow of the\r\nwater. The Estuarine clays of Great Britain--with the possible exception\r\nof the Jurassic deposits in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire--are of\r\nminor importance, but in some countries they form a valuable source of\r\nclay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Clay at Nostel, showing Marine Band. (_By\r\ncourtesy of T. Sheppard Esq._)]\r\n\r\n_Marine clays_ are, as their name implies, those deposited from sea\r\nwater. They are frequently found at a considerable distance from the\r\nshores of the ocean in which they were laid down, and subsequent risings\r\nand fallings of the surface of the earth have so altered the areas\r\noccupied by sea water, that a large number of marine deposits now form\r\ndry land. Though usually of enormous size and of generally persistent\r\ncharacter, marine clay deposits vary considerably in the composition of\r\nthe material at different depths, as well as in different areas. This is\r\nonly to be expected from the manner of their deposition, from the varied\r\nsources of the material and from the numerous river- and ocean-currents\r\ntaking part in their formation. For this reason it is generally\r\nnecessary to mix together portions of the deposit drawn from various\r\ndepths in order to secure a greater uniformity than would be obtained if\r\na larger area were to be worked to a smaller depth.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford clay which extends from the centre of England to the centre\r\nof France is a typical marine clay.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of all oceans at the present day is a deposit, of unknown\r\nthickness, of red calcareous clay or _ooze_ which is steadily increasing\r\nin amount and is thereby forming a fresh marine deposit, though at\r\npresent its inaccessibility deprives it of all economic value.\r\n\r\nIt is important not to overlook the enormous part played by variations\r\nin the level of the land relative to that of the ocean in past ages. For\r\ninstance, there is abundant evidence to show that practically the whole\r\nof Great Britain has been repeatedly submerged to great depths and has\r\nbeen raised to heights far greater than its present average. These\r\noft-repeated risings and settlings have caused great changes in the\r\nnature of the deposited materials so that in the Coal Measures, for\r\nexample, there are deposits of obviously fresh-water origin sandwiched\r\nin between others undoubtedly marine. It can readily be understood, as\r\nstated by Arber (24), that if, at a given period, the dry land during\r\nthe formation of the Coal Measures gradually subsided, it would first be\r\ncovered with clear water, whilst from those portions of the area which\r\noccupied the higher ground the rivers and streams continued to pour into\r\ntheir estuary a large amount of fresh-water material. Later, a stage\r\nwould be reached when mud of marine origin invaded the area and covered\r\nthe previous deposits. When, after an indefinitely long period, the\r\nground again rose, fresh-water deposits might again form, and this\r\nalternation of marine and fluviatile deposits appears to have been\r\nrepeated with great frequency during the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Coal Measures of Yorkshire and Lancashire, Stopes and\r\nWatson (23) have shown that the shales forming the roof of the Upper\r\nFoot Coal were derived from drifted sediments of marine origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecipitated Clays.\r\n\r\nIf the plasticity of some clays is really due to the colloidal nature of\r\ntheir particles, it is obvious that they must have been formed by a\r\nprocess of coagulation or precipitation at a distance from the site of\r\nthe minerals from which they have been derived. According to the\r\n'colloid theory,' felspar and other alumino-silicates are decomposed by\r\n'weathering,' the chief effect of which is the formation (by hydrolysis)\r\nof a colloidal solution of 'clay.' This apparently clear solution flows\r\nalong in the form of a small streamlet, joins other streamlets and\r\ncontinues its journey. So long as it is quite neutral or contains free\r\nalkali the solution will remain practically clear, but as soon as acids\r\nenter the stream, or are formed in it by the decomposition of organic\r\nmatter, a coagulation of the colloidal matter will commence and the\r\namount of 'clay' thus thrown out of solution will depend on the amount\r\nof such free acid.\r\n\r\nIf the coagulation or precipitation occurs in still water, the 'clay'\r\nwill be deposited almost immediately, otherwise it will be carried\r\nforward until it reaches a place where it can be deposited in the\r\nmanner already described.\r\n\r\nSuch precipitated clays need not necessarily be pure, as other\r\nsubstances may be present in colloidal form and may be coagulated at the\r\nsame time as the clay. In addition to these, the admixture of sand and\r\nother minerals present in suspension in the solution may become mixed\r\nwith the particles during coagulation and be deposited with them.\r\n\r\nClays formed in this manner are extremely difficult to identify on\r\naccount of the highly complex nature of the reactions occurring in their\r\nvicinity both during and subsequent to their formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-Deposited Clays.\r\n\r\nAlthough many clays and other materials have been transported and\r\naccumulated in the manner described, the majority of those now available\r\nhave been subjected to repeated transportation and deposition, owing to\r\nthe frequent and enormous changes in the relative levels of land and\r\nwater during the various geological epochs. So far as can be\r\nascertained, it is during these changes of position and the recurrent\r\nexposure to air and to water containing various substances in solution,\r\ntogether with the almost incessant grinding which took place during the\r\ntransportation and deposition, that most secondary clays became\r\nplastic. If this is the case, it explains the impossibility of\r\nincreasing the plasticity of clay by artificial means, at any rate on a\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nThe simplest of the agents of re-deposition are rain-storms and floods\r\nwhich, forming suddenly, may cause the water of a stream or river to\r\nflow with unwonted velocity and so carry away previously formed deposits\r\nof various kinds. Clays transported in this way are termed by Ries (6)\r\n_colluvial_ clays, the term 'diluvial' is generally employed in this\r\ncountry. If these are derived from a primary clay which has not\r\ntravelled far since it left the original granite from which it was\r\nformed, they will usually be white-burning and of only slight\r\nplasticity, but if the flood affects materials which have already been\r\nre-deposited several times, the colluvial clays may be of almost any\r\nimaginable composition. Floods of a different character--due to the\r\nsubsidence of the land so that it is partially covered with lake- or\r\nsea-water, which beats on its shores and erodes it in the manner already\r\ndescribed--are also important factors in the transportation of clays.\r\n\r\nSo far as clays are concerned, the action of the sea is both erosive and\r\ndepository, though the sedimentation in it being that of the pelagic\r\nooze at great depths the clayey material is quite inaccessible. Under\r\ncertain conditions, however, the sea may erode land in one area and may\r\nreturn the transported material to the land in another area. The\r\ndiluvial clay-silt known as _warp_ in the valley of the Humber is of\r\nthis character.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the action of water, however, much denudation,\r\ntransportation and re-deposition of clays and associated materials has\r\nbeen due to the action of ice in the form of glaciers, though these do\r\nnot appear to have had much effect in increasing the plasticity of the\r\nclays concerned.\r\n\r\n_Glacially deposited clays_ are characterised by their heterogeneous\r\ncomposition, some of them containing far more sand than true clay,\r\nwhilst yet retaining a sufficient amount of plasticity to enable them to\r\nbe used for rendering embankments impervious and for the manufacture of\r\ncommon bricks, and, occasionally, of coarse pottery; others contain so\r\nmuch sand as to be useless for these purposes. Most glacial deposits\r\ncontain a considerable proportion of stones and gravel which must be\r\nremoved before the clay can be used.\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of adventitious matter is due in great part to the\r\nmuch greater erosive force and carrying power of ice as compared with\r\nwater, resulting in much larger pieces of material being carried, and as\r\nthe whole of the ice-borne material is deposited almost simultaneously\r\nwhen the glacier melts, only a very small amount of separation of the\r\nmaterial into different grades takes place. The comparative freedom from\r\ncoarse sand of some glacial clays shows that some sorting does occur,\r\nbut it is very limited in extent as compared with that wrought in\r\nmaterials which have been exclusively transported by water.\r\n\r\nFor the manufacture of bricks, tiles and coarse pottery in Yorkshire,\r\nLancashire and some of the more northern counties of Great Britain,\r\nglacially deposited clays are of great importance in spite of their\r\nirregular composition. They are frequently termed 'boulder clays' or\r\n'drift clays' (p. 65), but in using these or any other terms for clays\r\ntransported by glacial action it is important that they should not be\r\nunderstood to refer to the whole of the deposited matter. Large\r\n'pockets' of coarse sand and gravel frequently occur in deposits of this\r\ncharacter and veins of the same materials are by no means uncommon. The\r\ncustom of some geologists of referring to the _whole_ of a glacial\r\ndeposit as 'boulder clay' has, in a number of cases, led to serious\r\nfinancial loss to clayworkers who have erroneously assumed that, because\r\nsome 'boulder clays' are used for brick and tile manufacture, all\r\ndeposits bearing a similar title would be equally suitable. This\r\ndifficulty would largely be avoided if, as is now increasingly the case,\r\nthe term 'drift' or 'glacial deposit' were used for the deposits as a\r\nwhole, the term 'boulder clay' being restricted to the plastic portions\r\nand not including pockets of sand, gravel and other non-plastic\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n_Boulder clays_--using this term in the limited sense just\r\nmentioned--consist of variable quantities of sand and clay, stones and\r\ngravel being generally associated with them. The stones may usually be\r\nremoved by careful picking, and the gravel by means of a 'clay cleaner'\r\nwhich forces the plastic material through apertures too small to allow\r\nthe gravel to pass. The plastic material so separated is far from being\r\na pure clay and may contain almost half its weight of sand, the greater\r\npart of which is readily separated by washing the material.\r\n\r\nBoulder clays, when freed from stones and gravel, are sufficiently\r\nplastic to meet the needs of most users, without being so highly plastic\r\nand contractile as to necessitate admixture with sand or similar\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nSome boulder clays contain limestone in the form of gravel or as a\r\ncoarse powder produced by the crushing of larger fragments. These are\r\nless suitable for manufacturing purposes as the lime produced when the\r\narticles are burned in the kilns is liable to swell and to disintegrate\r\nthem on exposure.\r\n\r\nOwing to their origin and the nature of the impurities they contain,\r\nboulder clays are never pure and when burned are irregular in colour and\r\nsomewhat fusible unless subjected to some process of purification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSOME CLAYS OF COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough clays occur in deposits of almost all geological periods, many\r\nof them are of little or no commercial value. This may be due to their\r\nsituation or to their composition and other characteristics. Thus, a\r\nCoal Measure clay is ordinarily quite inaccessible, and to sink a shaft\r\nspecially to obtain it may be an unprofitable undertaking; if, however,\r\na shaft is sunk for coal the clays in the neighbourhood of the coal\r\nseams are rendered accessible and, usually, a certain amount of such\r\nclays is brought to the surface in order to remove it out of the way of\r\nthe coal miners.\r\n\r\nAgain, a clay deposit may be so far removed from human habitations as to\r\nmake it practically valueless, but if, for any reason, the population of\r\nthe district in which the clay is situated grows sufficiently, the clay\r\nmay become of considerable value. It not infrequently happens,\r\ntherefore, that the commercial importance of a clay deposit is one which\r\nfluctuates considerably, yet, in spite of this fact, there are certain\r\nkinds of clay which are nearly always of some commercial value. The most\r\nimportant of these are the kaolins (china clays), the pottery and\r\nstoneware clays, the refractory clays (fireclays), the brick and\r\nterra-cotta clays and shales, and the clays used in the manufacture of\r\nPortland cement. The origin and manner in which these clays have been\r\naccumulated have been described in the previous chapters; it now remains\r\nto indicate their characteristics from the point of view of their\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\n=Commercial china clays and kaolins= in the United Kingdom are not\r\nsimple natural products but, in the state in which they are sold\r\ncommercially, have all been subjected to a careful treatment with water,\r\nfollowed by a process of sedimentation whereby the bulk of the\r\nimpurities have been removed. According to the extent to which this\r\ntreatment has been carried out, they will contain 10 per cent. or more\r\nmica and quartz, with little or no tourmaline, felspar and undecomposed\r\ngranite. In some parts of Europe and America, kaolins are found in a\r\nstate of sufficient purity to need no treatment of this kind unless they\r\nare to be used for the very highest class of wares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Magnified 220 Diameters_\r\n\r\n  _Magnified 920 Diameters_\r\n\r\n  _Magnified 220 Diameters_\r\n\r\n  _Magnified 220 Diameters_\r\n\r\n  Crystals of Kaolinite\r\n\r\n  _Magnified 920 Diameters_\r\n\r\n  Crystals of Secondary Muscovite.\r\n\r\nFig. 17. Kaolinite and Mica. (_After G. Hickling_ (36).)]\r\n\r\nMica is usually the chief impurity as its particles are so small and\r\ntheir density resembles that of the purified china clay more closely\r\nthan do the other minerals. In commerce the term _china clay_ is almost\r\ninvariably used to denote the washed material obtained from the 'china\r\nclay rock,' but at the pits the word 'clay' is used indiscriminately for\r\nthe carclazite (p. 78) and for the material obtained from it. As the\r\nterm 'kaolin' is used indifferently abroad for the crude 'deposit' and\r\nfor the purified commercial article, it should be understood that the\r\nfollowing information relates solely to the substance as usually sold\r\nand not to the crude material.\r\n\r\nCommercial china clay or kaolin is a soft white or faintly yellowish\r\nsubstance, easily reduced to an extremely fine powder, which when mixed\r\nwith twice its weight of water will pass completely through a No. 200\r\nsieve. Its specific gravity is 2·65, but the minuteness and nature of\r\nits smallest particles and their character are such that it will remain\r\nin suspension in water for several days; it thus appears to possess\r\ncolloidal properties, at any rate so far as the smaller particles are\r\nconcerned. It is almost infusible, but shows signs of softening at 1880°\r\nC. (Seger Cone 39) or at a somewhat lower temperature, according to the\r\nproportion of impurities present. When heated with silica or with\r\nvarious metallic oxides it fuses more readily owing to the formation of\r\nsilicates.\r\n\r\nChina clays and kaolins are not appreciably affected by dilute acids,\r\nbut some specimens are partially decomposed by boiling concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid (26) and all are decomposed by boiling sulphuric\r\nacid, the alumina being dissolved and the silica liberated in a form\r\neasily soluble in solutions of caustic soda or potash. This has led to\r\nthe conclusion that some kaolins may have been produced by weathering,\r\nas the bulk of true kaolinitic clays (such as Cornish china clay) is not\r\naffected by boiling hydrochloric acid (p. 81).\r\n\r\nOwing to the exceptional minuteness of its particles, it is extremely\r\ndifficult to ascertain whether pure china clay or kaolin is crystalline\r\nor amorphous. Johnson and Blake (21) found that all the specimens they\r\nexamined 'consisted largely of hexagonal plates' and that in most\r\nkaolins 'these plates are abundant--evidently constituting the bulk of\r\nthe substance.' This observation is contrary to the experience of most\r\ninvestigators, the majority of whom have found the bulk of the material\r\nto be amorphous and sponge-like, but a small portion of it to consist of\r\nhexagonal or rhombic crystals.\r\n\r\nMellor (22) has proposed the name _clayite_ for this amorphous material,\r\nthe crystalline portion being termed _kaolinite_ as suggested by Johnson\r\nand Blake.\r\n\r\nBoth kaolinite (crystalline) and clayite (amorphous) yield\r\nthe same results on analysis and correspond very closely to\r\nthe formula H4Al2Si2O9 or Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O, so that it is most\r\nprobable that they are the same substance in different physical states.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hickling (36) the general impression that the particles of\r\nchina clay are amorphous is due to the use of microscopes of\r\ninsufficient power. With an improved instrument, Hickling claims to have\r\nidentified the 'amorphous' portion of china clay with crystalline\r\nkaolinite, the clay particles (fig. 17) being in the form of irregular,\r\ncurved, hexagonal prisms or in isolated plates. The former show strong\r\ntransverse cleavages. The index of refraction and that of double\r\nrefraction agree with those of Anglesea kaolinite crystals, as does the\r\nspecific gravity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their great purity, commercial china clays and kaolins are\r\nalmost devoid of plasticity, nor can this property be greatly increased\r\nby any artificial treatment. This has led to the conclusion that\r\nplasticity is not an essential characteristic of the clayite or\r\nkaolinite molecules, but is due to physical causes not shown by any\r\ninvestigation of the chemical composition of the material.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specially purified kaolins just described, alkaline\r\nkaolins, siliceous kaolins and ferruginous kaolins are obtained from\r\nless pure rocks and do not undergo so thorough a treatment with water.\r\nSome of these varieties are not improbably derived from transported\r\nkaolins, as they occur in Tertiary strata, and so bear some resemblance\r\nto the white fireclays on the Carboniferous limestone of Staffordshire,\r\nDerbyshire and North Wales, though the latter are far more plastic.\r\n\r\nTo be of value, a china clay or kaolin must be as white as possible and\r\nmust be free from more than an insignificant percentage of metallic\r\noxides which will produce a colour when the clay is heated to bright\r\nredness. If the material is to be used in the manufacture of paper,\r\npaint or ultra-marine, these colour-producing oxides are of less\r\nimportance providing that the clay is sufficiently white in its\r\ncommercial state.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of china-ware and porcelain requires china clay or\r\nkaolin which, in addition to the foregoing characteristics, shall be\r\nhighly refractory. It must, therefore, be free from more than about 2\r\nper cent. of lime, magnesia, soda, potash, titanic acid and other\r\nfluxes.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that all white clays of slight plasticity are\r\nchina clays or kaolins. Some _pipe clays_ have these characteristics,\r\nbut they contain so large a proportion of impurities as to be useless\r\nfor the purposes for which china clay is employed and are consequently\r\nof small value.\r\n\r\nUsers of china clays and kaolins generally find it necessary to carry\r\nout a lengthy series of tests before accepting material from a new\r\nsource, as such a material may possess characteristics not readily shown\r\nby ordinary methods of analysis, but which are sufficiently active to\r\nmake it useless for certain purposes (see p. 143).\r\n\r\n=Pottery clays= are, as their name implies, those used in the\r\nmanufacture of pottery, and comprise the china clays already mentioned\r\n(p. 104), the ball clays and the less pure clays used in the manufacture\r\nof coarse red ware, flower pots, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _china clays_ (p. 104) are not used alone in pottery manufacture as\r\nthey lack plasticity and cohesion. In the production of china-ware or\r\nporcelain they are mixed with a fluxing material such as Cornish stone,\r\npegmatite, or felspar, together with quartz or bone ash. Thus, English\r\nchina ware is produced from a mixture of approximately equal parts of\r\nbone ash, china clay and Cornish stone, whilst felspathic or hard\r\nporcelain is made from a mixture of kaolin, felspar and quartz, a little\r\nchalk being sometimes added.\r\n\r\nThe _ball clays_ (p. 64) form the basis of most ordinary pottery, though\r\nsome china clay is usually added in order to produce a whiter ware.\r\nFlint is added to reduce the shrinkage--which would otherwise be\r\ninconveniently great--and the strength of the finished ware is\r\nincreased, its texture is rendered closer and its capability of emitting\r\na ringing sound when struck are produced by the inclusion of Cornish\r\nstone or felspar in the mixture. Small quantities of cobalt oxide are\r\nalso added to improve the whiteness in the better classes of ware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Mining best Potter's clay in Devonshire. (_Photo\r\nby Mr G. Bishop._)]\r\n\r\nThe ball clays are characterised by their remarkably high plasticity,\r\ntheir fine texture and their freedom from grit. They are by no means so\r\npure as the china clays, and unless carefully selected can only be used\r\nfor common ware.\r\n\r\nThe better qualities burn to a vitrified mass of a light brownish tint,\r\nbut when mixed with the other materials used in earthenware manufacture\r\nthey should produce a perfectly white ware. The inferior qualities are\r\nused for stoneware, drain pipes, etc. It should be noted that the term\r\n'ball clay' is used for clays of widely differing characteristics though\r\nall obtained from one geological formation; when ordering it is\r\nnecessary to state the purpose for which the clay is required or an\r\nentirely unsuitable material may be supplied. For the same reason, great\r\ncare is needed in any endeavour to sell a ball clay from an hitherto\r\nunworked deposit.\r\n\r\n_Coarse pottery clays_[11] are usually found near the surface and whilst\r\nthey may be derived from any geological formation, those most used in\r\nEngland are of Triassic or Permian origin, though some small potteries\r\nuse material of other periods, including alluvial or surface clays.\r\nThese clays are closely allied to those used for brickmaking, but are\r\nsomewhat finer in texture and more plastic. In some cases they are\r\nprepared from brick clays by treating the latter in a wash-mill, the\r\ncoarser particles being then removed, whilst the finer ones, in the\r\nstate of a slip or slurry, are run into a settling tank and are there\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Coarse pottery has been defined as that made from natural\r\nclay without the addition of any material other than sand and water.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of a considerable proportion of iron oxide results in the\r\nformation of red ware, which is necessarily of a porous nature, as the\r\nfluxes in the clay are such that they will not permit of its being\r\nheated to complete vitrification without loss of shape. To render it\r\nimpervious the ware is covered with a glaze, usually producing red,\r\nbrown or black ware (Rockingham ware).\r\n\r\nThe _stoneware_ or _drain-pipe clays_, are the most important of the\r\n_vitrifiable clays_ and owe their value to the fact that they can be\r\nreadily used for the manufacture of impervious ware without the\r\nnecessity of employing a glaze. They are, therefore, used in the\r\nmanufacture of vessels for holding corrosive liquids such as acids and\r\nother chemicals, for sanitary appliances, sewerage pipes and in many\r\nother instances where an impervious material is required.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lime, magnesia, potash and soda they contain, the stoneware\r\nclays undergo partial fusion at a much lower temperature than is\r\nrequired by some of the purer clays. The fused portion fills the pores\r\nor interstices of the material, making--when cold--a ware of great\r\nstrength and impermeability.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty experienced in the manufacture of stoneware is the\r\nliability of the articles to twist and warp when heated. For this reason\r\nit is necessary to burn them very carefully and to select the clays with\r\ncircumspection. Some clays are quite unsuitable for this branch of\r\npottery manufacture because of the practical impossibility of producing\r\nware which is correct in shape and is free from warping.\r\n\r\nWhat is required are clays in which the partial fusion will commence at\r\na moderate temperature and will continue until all the pores are filled\r\nwith the fused material without the remaining ingredients being attacked\r\nor corroded sufficiently to cause the ware to lose its shape. As the\r\ntemperature inside a potter's kiln is continually rising, the great\r\ntendency is for the production of fused material to take place at an\r\never-increasing rate, so that the danger of warping becomes greater as\r\nthe firing nears completion. Some clays commence to vitrify at a\r\nmoderate temperature and can be heated through a long range of\r\ntemperature before an appreciable amount of warping occurs; such clays\r\nare said to possess a 'long range of vitrification' (p. 38). In other\r\nclays the difference between the temperature at which vitrification\r\ncommences and that at which loss of shape occurs is only a few degrees;\r\nsuch clays are useless for the manufacture of stoneware, as their\r\nvitrification range is too short. It is therefore essential that, for\r\nthe manufacture of stoneware, a clay should contain a large proportion\r\nof refractory material which will form a 'skeleton,' the interstices of\r\nwhich will be filled by the more fusible silicates produced by the\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\nIt is generally found that of all the fluxes present in vitrifiable\r\nclays, soda and potash compounds--the so-called 'alkalies'--and all lime\r\ncompounds are the most detrimental, as in association with clay they\r\nform a material with a very short range of vitrification. Magnesia, on\r\nthe contrary, accompanies a long vitrification range.\r\n\r\nThe clays used in Great Britain for the manufacture of the best\r\nstoneware are the Devonshire and Dorset ball clays, the upper portions\r\nof these deposits being used for this purpose as they are somewhat less\r\npure than the lower portions used in the manufacture of white ware. For\r\ncoarser grades of stoneware, clays of other geological formations are\r\nemployed, especially where the finished ware may be coloured, as the\r\npurity of the clay is of less importance. Providing a clay has a\r\nsufficiently long vitrification range, a suitable colour when burned,\r\nand that it is capable of being readily formed into the desired shapes,\r\nits composition and origin are of small importance to the stoneware\r\nmanufacturer. In actual practice, however, the number of sources of good\r\nstoneware clay is distinctly limited, and many manufacturers are thus\r\ncompelled to add suitable fluxes to refractory clays in order to meet\r\nsome of their customers' requirements. For this purpose a mixture of\r\nfireclay with finely powdered felspar or Cornish stone is used.\r\nChalk--which is a cheaper and more powerful flux--or powdered glass\r\ncannot be used as the range of vitrification of the mixture would be too\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers take the opposite course and add fireclay, flint, or\r\nother refractory material to a readily fusible clay. This is\r\nsatisfactory if the latter clay is relatively low in lime and owes its\r\nfusibility to potash, soda or magnesia in the form of mica or felspar.\r\nThe mica and felspar grains enter so slowly into combination with the\r\nclay that a long range of vitrification occurs, whereas with lime, or\r\nwith some other soda and potash compounds, the combination occurs with\r\ngreat rapidity and the shape of the ware is spoiled.\r\n\r\nThe =refractory clays= are commonly known as _fireclays_ on account of\r\ntheir resistance to heat. The china clays and kaolins are also\r\nrefractory, but are too expensive and are not sufficiently plastic to be\r\nused commercially in the same manner as fireclays, except to a very\r\nlimited extent, though bricks have been made for many years from the\r\ninferior portions of china clay rock at Tregoning Hill in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe geological occurrence of the fireclays of the Coal Measures has\r\nalready been described on p. 53. In addition, there are the refractory\r\nclays occurring in pockets or depressions in the Mountain Limestone of\r\nNorth Wales, Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Ireland, which consist of\r\nsiliceous clays and sands, the insoluble residue of the local\r\ndissolution of the limestone, intermixed with the débris of the\r\noverlying Millstone Grit (see p. 54). These clays and sands can be mixed\r\nto produce bricks of remarkably low shrinkage, but the pockets are only\r\nlarge enough to enable comparatively small works to be erected and the\r\nclays are so irregular both in composition and distribution as to render\r\ntheir use somewhat speculative.\r\n\r\nA third type of refractory clay--termed _flint clay_--is used in large\r\nquantities in the United States, but is seldom found in Great Britain.\r\nWhen moistened, flint clays do not soften, but remain hard and\r\nflint-like with a smooth shell-like fracture. For use they are ground\r\nextremely fine, but even then they develop little plasticity. They are\r\nconsidered by Ries (6) to have been formed by solution and\r\nre-precipitation of the clay subsequent to its primary formation, in a\r\nmanner similar to flint. They are somewhat rich in alumina and many\r\ncontain crystals of pholerite (Al2O3·2SiO2·3H2O).\r\n\r\nThe Coal Measure fireclays (p. 53)--which are by far the most\r\nimportant--are divided into two sections by the coal seams, those above\r\nthe coal being shaly and fissile in structure whilst those below\r\n(_underclays_) are without any distinct lamination. Both these clays\r\nmay be equally refractory, but the underclays are those to which the\r\nterm fireclay is usually applied. The lowest portions are usually more\r\nsilicious and in some areas are so rich in silica as to be more\r\nappropriately termed silica rock or _ganister_. Fireclays may, in fact,\r\nbe looked upon as a special term for the grey clays of the Coal\r\nMeasures, interstratified with and generally in close proximity to the\r\nseams of coal. They are known locally as _clunches_ and _underclays_ and\r\nwere at one time supposed to represent the soil that produced the\r\nvegetation from which the coal was formed, but are now considered by\r\nmany authorities to be of estuarine origin.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that whilst the coals almost invariably occur\r\nin association with underclays, some fireclays are found at a\r\nconsiderable distance from coal.\r\n\r\nThe fireclays of the Coal Measures have a composition varying within\r\ncomparatively wide limits even in contiguous strata; those chiefly used\r\nhaving an average of 20 to 30 per cent. of alumina and 50 to 70 per\r\ncent. of silica. They appear to consist of a mixture of clay and quartz\r\nwith a small proportion of other minerals, but in some of them a portion\r\nof the clay is replaced by halloysite--another hydro-alumino-silicate\r\nwith the formula\r\n\r\nH6Al2Si2O10 or Al2O3.2SiO2.3H2O.\r\n\r\nTheir grey colour is largely due to vegetable (carbonaceous) matter and\r\nto iron compounds. The latter--usually in the form of pyrites--is\r\ndetrimental to the quality of the goods as it forms a readily fusible\r\nslag. Unlike the iron in red-burning clays it can seldom be completely\r\noxidized and so rendered harmless. The fireclays must therefore be\r\ncarefully selected by the miners.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, and to a much smaller extent in Great Britain,\r\nrefractory articles are made from mixtures of grog or burned fireclay\r\nwith just sufficient raw clay to form a mass of the required strength.\r\nFor this purpose a highly plastic, refractory clay is required and the\r\nTertiary ball clays of Devon and Dorset (p. 64) are particularly\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristics of a fireclay are that it shall be\r\nable to resist any temperature to which it may be exposed and that the\r\narticles into which it is made shall not be affected by rapid changes in\r\ntemperature. Other characteristics of importance in some industries are\r\nthe resistance to corrosive action of slags and vapours, to cutting and\r\nabrasion by dust in flue-gases or by the implements used in cleaning the\r\nfires. For those purposes it is necessary that a fireclay should possess\r\nhigh infusibility (p. 32), a low burning shrinkage (p. 29) and a high\r\ndegree of refractoriness (p. 34), and before it is used these\r\ncharacteristics should be ascertained by means of definite tests, as\r\nthey cannot be determined by inspection of a sample or from a study of\r\nits chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nSeveral grades of fireclay have long been recognized on the Continent\r\nand in the United States of America, but the recent Specification of the\r\nInstitution of Gas Engineers is the only official recognition in Great\r\nBritain of definite grades. This specification defines as No. 1 grade a\r\nfireclay which shows no signs of fusion when heated to 1670° C. or Cone\r\n30 at the rate of 10° C. per minute, and as No. 2 grade fireclay those\r\nwhich show no signs of fusion when similarly heated to 1580° C. or Cone\r\n26.\r\n\r\nIt is regarded as a sign of fusion if a test piece with sharp angles\r\nloses its angularity after heating to a predetermined temperature (see\r\np. 35).\r\n\r\nIt is customary to regard as 'fireclay' all clays which, when formed\r\ninto the shape of a Seger Cone (fig. 6) do not bend on heating slowly\r\nuntil a temperature of 1580° C. (Cone 26) is reached. Any clays\r\ncomprised within this definition and yet not sufficiently refractory to\r\nbe of the No. 2 grade just mentioned may be regarded as No. 3 grade\r\nfireclays. Many of the last named are well suited for the manufacture of\r\nblocks for domestic fireplaces, for glazed bricks and for firebricks not\r\nintended to resist furnace temperatures.\r\n\r\nTo resist sudden changes in temperature the material must be very\r\nporous--the article being capable of absorbing at least one-sixth of its\r\nvolume of water. For this reason it is customary to mix fireclays with a\r\nlarge proportion of non-plastic material of a somewhat coarse texture,\r\nthe substance most generally employed being fireclay which has been\r\npreviously burned and then crushed. This material is known as _grog_ or\r\n_chamotte_ and has the advantage over other substances of not affecting\r\nthe composition of the fireclay to which it is added, whilst greatly\r\nincreasing its technical usefulness. The addition of grog also reduces\r\nthe shrinkage of the clay during drying and ensures a sounder article\r\nbeing produced.\r\n\r\nThe most serious impurities in refractory clays are lime, magnesia,\r\nsoda, potash and titanium and their compounds as they lower the\r\nrefractoriness of the material. Iron, in the state of ferric oxide is of\r\nless importance, but pyrites and all ferrous compounds are particularly\r\nobjectionable. Pyritic and calcareous nodules may, to a large extent, be\r\nremoved by picking, and by throwing away lumps in which they are seen to\r\noccur. There is, at present, no other means of removing them.\r\n\r\nFireclays may be ground directly they come from the mine, but it is\r\nusually better to expose them to the action of the weather as this\r\neffects various chemical and physical changes within the material,\r\nwhich improves its quality as well as reduces the power required to\r\ncrush it.\r\n\r\nTo take full advantage of the refractory qualities of a clay it is\r\nnecessary to select it with skill, prepare and mould it with care, to\r\nburn it slowly and steadily, to finish the heating at a sufficiently\r\nhigh temperature and to cool the ware slowly.\r\n\r\nRapidly heated fireclay is seldom so resistant to heat under commercial\r\nconditions as that which has been more steadily fired. Rapid or\r\nirregular heating causes an irregular formation and distribution of the\r\nfused material during the process of vitrification (p. 37) and so\r\nproduces goods which are too tender to be durable. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary to exercise great care in the firing.\r\n\r\n=Shales= are rocks which have been subjected to considerable pressure\r\nsubsequent to their deposition and are, consequently, laminated and more\r\nreadily split in one direction than in others. Some shales are almost\r\nentirely composed of silica or calcareous matter, but many others are\r\nrich in clay, the term referring to physical structure and not to\r\nchemical composition. The clay-shales occur chiefly in the Silurian and\r\nCarboniferous formations, the latter being more generally used by\r\nclayworkers.\r\n\r\nClay-shales are valued according to (_a_) the proportion of oil which\r\ncan be distilled from them, those rich in this respect being termed _oil\r\nshales_; (_b_) the colour when burned, as in _brickmaking and\r\nterra-cotta shales_; (_c_) the refractoriness, as in _fireclay shales_\r\nand (_d_) the facility with which they are decomposed on exposure or on\r\nheating and form sulphuric acid as in _alum shales_.\r\n\r\n_Oil shales_ contain so much carbonaceous matter that on distillation at\r\na low red heat they yield commercially remunerative quantities of a\r\ncrude oil termed _shale tar_. In composition they are intermediate\r\nbetween cannel coal and a purely mineral shale. To be of value they\r\nshould not yield less than 30 gallons of crude oil per ton of shale,\r\nwith ammonia and illuminating gas as by-products. They are of Silurian,\r\nCarboniferous or Oolitic origin, the Kimeridge shale associated with the\r\nlast-named being very valuable in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe most important oil shales occur in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe _fireclay shales_ have already been described on pages 53 and 116.\r\n\r\nThe _brickmaking shales_ are those which are sufficiently rich in clay\r\nto form a plastic paste when ground and mixed with water. They can be\r\nmade into bricks of excellent colour and great strength, but for this\r\npurpose require the use of powerful crushing and mixing machinery. They\r\nare usually converted into a stiff paste of only moderate plasticity and\r\nare then moulded by machinery in specially designed presses, though some\r\nfirebricks are made from crushed shale mixed into a soft paste with\r\nwater and afterwards moulded by hand. Some shales, such as the _knotts_\r\nat Fletton near Peterborough are not made into a paste, the moist\r\npowdered shale being pressed into bricks by very powerful machinery.\r\n\r\nBrickmaking shales may be found in any of the older geological\r\nformations, though they occur chiefly in the Silurian, Permian,\r\nCarboniferous and Jurassic systems. The purer shales of the Coal\r\nMeasures burn to an agreeable cream or buff colour, the less pure ones\r\nand those of the other formations mentioned produce articles of a\r\nbrick-red or blue-grey colour.\r\n\r\nWhere the shales are of exceptionally fine grain and their colour when\r\nburned is very uniform and of a pleasing tint they are known as\r\n_terra-cotta_ shales, the red terra-cottas being chiefly made from those\r\noccurring in Wales and the buff ones from the lower grade fireclays of\r\nthe Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n_Alum shales_ are characterised by a high proportion of pyrites, which,\r\non roasting, form ferrous sulphate and sulphuric acid. The latter\r\ncombines with the alumina in the shale and when the roasted ore is\r\nextracted with water a solution of iron sulphate and aluminium sulphate\r\nis obtained. From this solution (after partial evaporation) alum\r\ncrystals are obtained by the addition of potassium or ammonium sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe chief alum shales are those of the Silurian formation in Scotland\r\nand Scandinavia. The Liassic shales of Whitby were at one time an\r\nequally important source of alum.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years a large amount of alum has been obtained from other\r\nsources or has been made from the lower grade Dorset and Devonshire ball\r\nclays by calcining them and then treating them with sulphuric acid.\r\nThese clays being almost free from iron compounds yield a much purer\r\nalum at a lower cost.\r\n\r\n=Brick clays= are those which are not suitable--either from nature or\r\nsituation--for the manufacture of pottery or porcelain and yet possess\r\nsufficient plasticity to enable them to be made into bricks. The term is\r\nused somewhat loosely, and geologists not infrequently apply it to clays\r\nwhich are quite unsuitable for brickmaking on account of excessive\r\nshrinkage and the absence of any suitable non-plastic medium. Large\r\nportions of the 'London clay' are of this nature and can only be\r\nregarded as of use to brick- and roofing-tile-manufacturers when the\r\nassociated Bagshot sands are readily accessible. Similarly, some of the\r\nvery tough surface clays of the Northern and Midland counties are\r\nequally valueless, though designated 'brick clays' in numerous\r\ngeological and other reports. It is, therefore, necessary to remember\r\nthat, as ordinarily used, the term 'brick clay' merely indicates a\r\nmaterial which appears at first sight to be suitable for brickmaking,\r\nbut that more detailed investigations are necessary before it can be\r\nascertained whether a material so designated is actually suitable for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to observe that local industrial conditions may be\r\nsuch that a valuable clay may be used for brickmaking because there is a\r\ndemand for bricks, but not for the other articles for which the clay is\r\nequally suitable. For instance, a considerable number of houses in\r\nNorthumberland and Durham were built of firebricks at a time when it was\r\nmore profitable to sell these articles for domestic buildings than for\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\nIn many ways the bricks used for internal structural work form the\r\nsimplest and most easily manufactured of all articles made from clay.\r\nThe colour of the finished product is of minor importance and so long as\r\na brick of reasonably accurate shape and of sufficient strength is\r\nproduced at a cheap rate, little else is expected.\r\n\r\nImpurities--unless in excessively large proportions--are of small\r\nimportance and, indeed, sand may almost be considered an essential\r\nconstituent of a material to be used for making ordinary bricks. It is,\r\ntherefore, possible to utilize for this purpose some materials\r\ncontaining so little 'clay' as to make them scarcely fit to be included\r\nin this term. So long as the adventitious materials consist chiefly of\r\nsilica and chalk and the mixture is sufficiently plastic to make strong\r\nbricks, it may be used satisfactorily in spite of its low content of\r\nclay, but if the so-called 'brick clay' contains limestone, either in\r\nlarge grains or nodules, it will be liable to burst the bricks or to\r\nproduce unsightly 'blow-holes' on their surfaces. If too much sand or\r\nother non-plastic material is present, the resulting bricks will be too\r\nweak to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nNo brick clay can be regarded as 'safe' if it contains nodules of\r\nlimestone--unless these can be removed during the preparation of the\r\nmaterial--or if the resulting bricks will not show a crushing strength\r\nof at least 85 tons per square foot.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of machinery in place of hand-moulding and of kilns\r\ninstead of clamps has greatly raised the standard of strength, accuracy\r\nin shape and uniformity in colour in many districts, and many builders\r\nin the Midlands now expect to sort out from the 'common bricks'\r\npurchased, a sufficient number of superior quality to furnish all the\r\n'facing bricks' they require. Apart from this, and in districts where\r\nbuildings are faced with stone or with bricks of a superior quality, the\r\n'stock' or 'common brick' may be made from almost any clay which will\r\nbear drying and heating to redness without shrinking excessively or\r\ncracking. A linear shrinkage of 1 in. per foot (= 8-1/2 per cent.) may\r\nbe regarded as the maximum with most materials used for brickmaking.\r\nClays which shrink more than this must have a suitable quantity of grog,\r\nsand, chalk, ashes or other suitable non-plastic material added.\r\n\r\nIf the clay contains much ferric oxide it will produce red or brown\r\nbricks according to the temperature reached in the kiln, but if much\r\nchalk is also present (or is added purposely) a combined\r\nlime-iron-silicate is produced and the bricks will be white in colour.\r\nIf only a small percentage of ferric oxide is present a clay will\r\nproduce buff bricks, which will be spotted with minute black specks or\r\nlarger masses of a greyish black slag if pyrites are also present or if\r\nferrous silicate has been produced by the reduction of the iron\r\ncompounds and their subsequent combination with silica.\r\n\r\nFurther information on brick earths will be found on page 67.\r\n\r\nA description of the processes used in the manufacture of bricks being\r\noutside the scope of the present work, the reader requiring information\r\non this subject should consult _Modern Brickmaking_ (25) or some similar\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\n_Roofing tiles_ require clays of finer texture than those which may be\r\nmade into bricks. Stones, if present, must be removed by washing or\r\nother treatment, as it is seldom that they can be crushed to a\r\nsufficiently fine powder, unless only rough work is required. If\r\nsufficiently fine, the clay used for roofing tiles may be precisely the\r\nsame as that used for bricks and is treated in a similar manner. It\r\nmust, however, be of such a nature that it will not warp or twist during\r\nthe burning; it must, therefore, have a long range of vitrification (p.\r\n38).\r\n\r\n_Terra-cotta_ is an Italian term signifying baked earth, but its meaning\r\nis now limited to those articles made of clay which are not classed as\r\npottery, such as statues, large vases, pillars, etc., modelled work used\r\nin architecture, or for external decoration. Although the distinction\r\ncannot be rigidly maintained, articles made of clay may be roughly\r\ndivided into\r\n\r\n(_a_) Pottery (_faience_) and porcelain (glazed),\r\n\r\n(_b_) Terra-cotta (unglazed),\r\n\r\n(_c_) Bricks and unglazed tiles devoid of decoration.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, terra-cotta occupies an intermediate position between\r\npottery and bricks, but no satisfactory definition has yet been found\r\nfor it. Thus, bricks with a modelled or moulded ornament are, strictly,\r\nterra-cotta, yet are not so named, and some pottery is unglazed and yet\r\nis never classed as terra-cotta, whilst glazed bricks are never regarded\r\nas pottery. Again during the past few years, what is termed 'glazed\r\nterra-cotta' has been largely used for architectural purposes, yet this\r\nis really 'faience.'\r\n\r\nAlthough this overlapping of terms may appear confusing to the reader,\r\nit does not cause any appreciable amount of inconvenience to the\r\nmanufacturers or users, as it is not difficult for a practical\r\nclayworker to decide in which of the three classes mentioned a given\r\narticle should be placed.\r\n\r\nPartly on account of the lesser weight, but chiefly in order to reduce\r\nthe tendency to crack and to facilitate drying and burning, terra-cotta\r\narticles are usually made hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that clays used in the manufacture of terra-cotta should\r\nbe of so fine a texture that the finest modelling can be executed. Such\r\nclays occur naturally in several geological formations, and some may be\r\nprepared from coarser materials by careful washing, whereby the larger\r\ngrains of sand, stones, etc., are removed. Some shales, when finely\r\nground, make excellent clays for architectural terra-cotta, portions of\r\nall the better known fireclay deposits being used for this purpose. It\r\nis, however, necessary to use only those shales which are naturally of\r\nfine texture, as mechanical grinding cannot effect a sufficient\r\nsub-division of the particles of some of the coarser shales.\r\n\r\nThe finer Triassic 'marls' are also admirable for terra-cotta work, the\r\nmost famous deposit being the Etruria Marl Series in the Upper Coal\r\nMeasures near Ruabon.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristics required in terra-cotta clays are\r\n(_a_) fine texture, or at any rate the ability to yield a fine, dense\r\nsurface, (_b_) small shrinkage with little tendency to twist, warp or\r\ncrack in firing, (_c_) pleasing and uniform colour when fired, and (_d_)\r\na sufficient proportion of fluxes to make it resistant to weather\r\nwithout giving a glossy appearance to the finished product.\r\n\r\nIn large pieces of terra-cotta some irregularity of shape is almost\r\nunavoidable, but, if care is taken in the selection and manipulation of\r\nthe material, this need not be unsightly.\r\n\r\nThe durability of terra-cotta is largely dependent on the nature of the\r\nsurface. The most suitable clays, when fired, have a thin 'skin' of\r\nvitrified material which is very resistant to climatic influences, and\r\nso long as this remains intact the ware will continue in perfect\r\ncondition. If this 'skin' is removed, rain will penetrate the material\r\nand under the influence of frost may cause rapid disintegration.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of very large pieces of terra-cotta a coarse, porous\r\nclay is used for the foundation and interior, and this is covered with\r\nthe finer clay. By this means a greater resistance to changes in\r\ntemperature is secured, the drying and the burning of the material in\r\nthe kiln are facilitated and the risks of damage in manufacture are\r\nmaterially reduced.\r\n\r\n=Cement clays= are those used in the manufacture of Portland cement and\r\nof so-called natural cements. They are largely of an alluvial character\r\nand are of two chief classes: (_a_) those which contain chalk or\r\nlimestone dust and clay in proportions suitable for the manufacture of\r\ncement and (_b_) those to which chalk or ground limestone must be added.\r\n\r\nThey vary in composition from argillaceous limestones containing only a\r\nsmall proportion of clay to almost pure clays.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of Portland cement has assumed a great importance and\r\nowing to the large amount of investigations made in connection with it,\r\nit may be said to represent the chief cement made from argillaceous\r\nmaterials, the others being convenient though crude modifications of it.\r\n\r\nThe essential constituents are calcium carbonate (introduced in the form\r\nof chalk or powdered limestone) and clay, the composition of the\r\nnaturally occurring materials being modified by the addition of a\r\nsuitable proportion of one or other of these ingredients. The material\r\nis then heated until it undergoes partial fusion and a 'clinker' is\r\nformed. This clinker, when ground, forms the cement.\r\n\r\nIn Kent, the Medway mud is mixed with chalk; in Sussex, a mixture of\r\ngault clay and chalk is employed; in the Midlands and South Wales,\r\nLiassic shales and limestone are used; in Northumberland a mixture of\r\nKentish chalk and a local clay is preferred, and in Cambridgeshire a\r\nspecial marl lying between the Chalk and the Greensand is found to be\r\nadmirable for the purpose because it contains the ingredients in almost\r\nexactly the required proportions.\r\n\r\nFor cement manufacture, clays should be as free as possible from\r\nmaterial which, in slip form, will not pass through a No. 100 sieve, as\r\ncoarse sand and other rock débris are practically inert. The proportion\r\nof alumina and iron should be about one-third, but not more than\r\none-half, that of the silica, and in countries where the proportion of\r\nmagnesia in a cement is limited by standard specifications, it will be\r\nfound undesirable to use clays containing more than 3 per cent. of\r\nmagnesia and alkalies.\r\n\r\nWhilst calcareous clays usually prove the most convenient in the\r\nmanufacture of cement, it is by no means essential to use them, and\r\nwhere a clay almost free from lime occurs in convenient proximity to a\r\nsuitable chalk or limestone deposit an excellent cement may usually be\r\nmanufactured.\r\n\r\nThe 'clays' from which the so-called 'natural' or 'Roman cements' are\r\nmade by simple calcination and crushing, usually fuse at a lower\r\ntemperature than do the mixtures used for Portland cement, and unless\r\ntheir composition is accurately adjusted they yield a product of such\r\nvariable quality as to be unsuitable for high class work.\r\n\r\n=Fuller's earth= is a term used to indicate any earthy material which\r\ncan be employed for fulling or degreasing wool and bleaching oil. True\r\nfuller's earth is obtained chiefly from the neighbourhood of Reigate,\r\nSurrey, Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire and from below the Oolite formation\r\nnear Bath, but owing to the scarcity of the material and the\r\nirregularity of its behaviour, china clay is now largely used for the\r\nsame purpose. True fuller's earth is much more fusible than the white\r\nclays usually substituted for it, and when mixed with water it does not\r\nform a plastic paste but falls to powder. As the chief requirement of\r\nthe fuller is the grease-absorbing power of the material there is no\r\nobjection to the substitution of other earths of equal efficiency.\r\n\r\nFuller's earth does not appear to be a true clay, though its\r\nconstitution and mineralogical composition are by no means\r\nclearly known. T. J. Porter considers that it is chiefly\r\ncomposed of montmorillonite (Al2O3·4SiO2H2O), anauxite,\r\n(2Al2O3·9SiO2·6H2O), and chalk with some colloidal silica and a\r\nlittle quartz. It therefore appears to resemble the less pure kaolins,\r\nbut to contain little or no true clay, though in many respects it\r\nbehaves in a manner similar to a kaolin of unusually low plasticity.\r\n\r\n=Other clays= of commercial importance, with further details of the ones\r\njust mentioned, are described in the author's _British Clays, Shales and\r\nSands_ (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCLAY SUBSTANCE: THEORETICAL AND ACTUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving indicated the origin, modes of accumulation and general\r\ncharacteristics of the numerous materials known as 'clay,' it now\r\nremains to ascertain what substance, if any, is contained in all of them\r\nand may be regarded as their essential constituent, to which their\r\nproperties are largely due. Just as the value of an ore is dependent to\r\na very large extent on the proportion of the desired metal which it\r\ncontains, and just as coal is largely, though not entirely, esteemed in\r\nproportion to the percentage of carbon and hydrogen in it, so there may\r\nbe an essential substance in clays to which they owe the most important\r\nof their characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of metal in an ore or of hydrocarbon in a coal can be\r\nascertained without serious difficulty by some means of analysis, but\r\nwith clay the difficulties are so great that, to some extent at least,\r\nthey must be regarded as being, for the present, insurmountable. This is\r\nin no small measure due to the general recognition of all minerals or\r\nrocks which become plastic when kneaded with water as 'clays' without\r\nmuch regard being paid to their composition. Consequently materials of\r\nthe most diverse nature in other respects are termed clays if they are\r\nknown to become plastic under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, at the present time, no generally accepted definition\r\nof clay which distinguishes it from mixtures of clay and sand or other\r\nfine mineral particles. The usual geological definitions are so broad as\r\nto include many mixtures containing considerably less than half their\r\nweight of true clay or they avoid the composition of the material\r\naltogether and describe it as a finely divided product of the\r\ndecomposition of rocks.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to avoid this unfortunate position, which\r\nis alike unsatisfactory to the geologist, the mineralogist and the\r\nchemist as well as to the large number of people engaged in the purchase\r\nand use of various clays; and, whilst the end sought has not been\r\nreached as completely as is desirable, great progress has been made and\r\nmuch has been accomplished during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest attempts to ascertain whether there is an essential\r\nconstituent of all clays was made by Seger (7) who used two methods of\r\nseparating some of the ingredients of natural clays from the remaining\r\nconstituents. The first of these methods consists in an application of\r\nthe investigations of Schulze, Schloesing and Schoene on soils, viz.\r\nthe removal of the finest particles by elutriation; the second is an\r\nextension of the method of Forschammer and Fresenius, viz. the treatment\r\nof the material with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nTo the product containing the clay when either of these methods is used\r\nSeger gave the name _clay substance_, but the material so separated is\r\nby no means pure clay. The term clay substance must, therefore, be\r\nconfined to the crude product containing the clay together with such\r\nother impurities as are in the form of extremely small particles or are\r\nsoluble in sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt has not yet been found possible to isolate pure clay from ordinary\r\nclays, so that in investigating the nature of what Seger was\r\nendeavouring to produce when he obtained the crude clay substance,\r\nindirect methods are necessary.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that if a sample of 'clay'--using this word in\r\nthe broadest sense--is rubbed in a considerable quantity of water so as\r\nto form a thin slip or slurry, it may readily be divided into a number\r\nof fractions each of which will consist of grains of different sizes.\r\nThis separation may be effected by means of a series of sieves through\r\nwhich the slurry is poured, or the slurry may be caused to flow at a\r\nseries of different speeds, the material left behind at each rate of\r\nspeed being kept separate; or, finally, the slurry may be allowed to\r\nstand for a few seconds and may then be carefully decanted into another\r\nvessel in which it may remain at rest for a somewhat longer period,\r\nthese times of resting and decantation, if repeated, providing a series\r\nof fractions the materials in which are more or less different in their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n'Clays' containing a considerable proportion of coarse material are most\r\nconveniently separated into a series of fractions by means of sieves,\r\nwhereby they are divided into (i) stones, (ii) gravel, (iii) coarse\r\nsand, (iv) medium sand, (v) fine sand and (vi) a slurry consisting of\r\nsuch small particles that they can no longer be separated by sifting. If\r\nthe residues on the sieves are carefully washed free from any adhering\r\nfine material and are then dried, they will be found on examination to\r\nbe quite distinct from anything definable as clay. They may consist of a\r\nconsiderable variety of minerals or may be almost entirely composed of\r\nquartz, but with the possible exception of some shales of great\r\nhardness, they are undoubtedly not clay. This simple process therefore\r\nserves to remove a proportion of material which in the case of some\r\n'clays' is very large but in others is insignificant; thus 40 per cent.\r\nof sand-like material may be removed from some brick-clays whilst a ball\r\nclay used for the manufacture of stoneware or pottery may pass\r\ncompletely through a sieve having 200 meshes per linear inch.\r\n\r\nThe material which passes through the finest sieve employed will contain\r\nall the true clay in the material; that is to say, the coarser portion\r\nwill, as already mentioned, be devoid of the ordinary characteristics of\r\nclay. At the same time, this very fine material will seldom consist\r\nexclusively of clay, but will usually contain a considerable proportion\r\nof silt, extremely fine mineral particles and, in the case of calcareous\r\nclays, a notable proportion of calcium carbonate in the form of chalk or\r\nlimestone particles. Only in the case of the purest clays will the\r\nmaterial now under consideration consist entirely of clay, so that it\r\nmust be again separated into its constituents. This is best\r\naccomplished, as first suggested by Schoene, by exposing the material to\r\nthe action of a stream of water of definite speed. H. Seger (7)\r\ninvestigated this method very thoroughly and his recommendations as to\r\nthe manner in which this separation by elutriation should be carried out\r\nremain in use at the present time. Briefly, all material sufficiently\r\nfine to be carried away by a stream of water flowing at the rate of 0·43\r\nin. per minute was found by Seger to include the whole of the clay in\r\nthe samples he examined, but, as was later pointed out by Bischof, it is\r\nnot correct to term the whole of this material 'clay substance,' as when\r\nexamined under the microscope, it contains material which is clearly not\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nProcesses of decantation of the finest material obtained after\r\nelutriation still fail to separate all the non-clay material, and Vogt\r\nhas found that when the material has been allowed to stand in suspension\r\nfor nine days some particles of mica are still associated with the clay.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that no process of mechanical separation will serve\r\nfor a complete purification of a clay; indeed, there are good reasons\r\nfor supposing that extremely fine particles of quartz and mica render\r\nphysical characteristics an uncertain means of accurately distinguishing\r\nclays from other rock dust.\r\n\r\nWhen chemical methods of investigation are employed the problem is not\r\nmaterially altered, nor is its solution fully attained. It is, of\r\ncourse, obvious that any chemical method should be applied to the\r\nproduct obtained by treating the raw material mechanically as above\r\ndescribed, for to do otherwise is to create needless confusion. Yet by\r\nfar the greater number of published analyses of 'clays' report the\r\nultimate composition of the whole material, no attempt being made to\r\nshow how much of the various constituents is in the form of sand, stones\r\nor other coarse particles of an entirely non-argillaceous character.\r\n\r\nIf the particles of a 'clay' which are sufficiently small to be carried\r\naway by a stream of water with a velocity of only 0·43 in. per minute\r\nare analysed, it will be found that their composition will vary\r\naccording to the origin of the clay and the subsequent treatment to\r\nwhich it has been subjected during its transport and deposition. If the\r\nclay is fairly free from calcareous material and is of a white-burning\r\nnature it may be found to have a composition like china clays.\r\nRed-burning clays, on the contrary, will vary greatly in composition, so\r\nthat it becomes difficult to find any close analogy between these kinds\r\nof clay. This difference is partly due to the extremely fine state of\r\ndivision in which ferric oxide occurs in clays, the particles of this\r\nmaterial corresponding in minuteness to those of the purest clays and so\r\nbeing inseparable by any mechanical process.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 H. Seger (7) published what he termed a method of 'rational\r\nanalysis,' which consisted in treating the clay with boiling sulphuric\r\nacid followed by a treatment with caustic soda. He found that the purer\r\nchina clays (kaolins) and ball clays were made soluble by this means and\r\nthat felspar, mica and quartz were to a large extent unaffected. Later\r\ninvestigators have found that this method is only applicable to a\r\nlimited extent and that its indications are only reliable when applied\r\nto the clays just named, but the principle introduced by Seger has\r\nproved invaluable in increasing our knowledge of the composition of\r\nclays. By means of this so-called rational analysis Seger found that the\r\npurer clays yielded results of remarkable similarity and uniformity,\r\nthe material entering into solution having a composition agreeing very\r\nclosely with the formula Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O which is generally\r\nrecognized as that of the chief constituent or constituents of china\r\nclay (kaolin) and the purer ball clays. This crude substance, obtainable\r\nfrom a large number of clays by the treatment just described, was named\r\n_clay substance_ by Seger, who regarded it as the essential constituent\r\nof all clays.\r\n\r\nRed-burning clays when similarly treated do not yield so uniform a\r\nproduct, and the ferric oxide entering into solution makes the results\r\nvery discordant. Moreover, even with the china clays or kaolins a small\r\nproportion of alkalies, lime and other oxides enter into solution and a\r\nnumber of minerals analogous to clay, but quite distinct from it, are\r\nalso decomposed and dissolved. For these reasons the 'rational analysis'\r\nhas been found insufficient; it is now considered necessary to make an\r\nanalysis of the portion rendered soluble by treatment with sulphuric\r\nacid in order to ascertain what other ingredients it may contain in\r\naddition to the true clay present.\r\n\r\nAs the china clays (kaolins) and ball clays on very careful elutriation\r\nall yield a product of the same ultimate composition, viz. 39 per cent.\r\nof alumina, 46 per cent. of silica, 13 per cent. of water, and 2 per\r\ncent. of other oxides, they are generally regarded as consisting of\r\npractically pure clay with a variable amount of impurities. Many years\r\nago Fresenius suggested that these non-clayey constituents of clays\r\nshould be calculated into the minerals to which they appeared likely to\r\ncorrespond so as to obtain a result similar to that obtained by Seger\r\nwithout the disadvantages of the treatment with sulphuric acid and as\r\nsupplementary to such treatment in the case of red-burning and some\r\nother clays. More recent investigators have found that if a careful\r\nmicroscopic examination of the clay is made the results of estimating\r\nthe composition from the proportion of the different minerals\r\nrecognizable under the microscope and by calculation from the analysis\r\nof the material agree very closely and are, as Bischof (28) and, more\r\nrecently, Mellor have pointed out, more reliable than the 'rational\r\nanalysis' in the case of impure clays. If care is taken to make a\r\nmicroscopical examination identifying the chief impurities present the\r\ncalculation from the analysis may usually be accepted as sufficiently\r\naccurate, but it is very unsatisfactory to assume, as some chemists do,\r\nthat the alkalies and lime in the clay are all in the form of felspar\r\nand that the silica remaining in excess of that required to combine with\r\nthe alkalies, lime and alumina is free quartz. Some clays are almost\r\ndestitute of felspar but comparatively rich in mica, whilst others are\r\nthe reverse, so that some means of identifying the extraneous minerals\r\nis essential. When this is not used, the curious result is obtained\r\nthat German chemists calculate the alkalies, etc. to felspar whilst the\r\nFrench chemists, following Vogt, calculate them to mica; English ceramic\r\nchemists appear undecided as to which course to follow, and some of them\r\noccasionally report notable amounts of felspar in clays quite destitute\r\nof this mineral!\r\n\r\nA statement of the composition of a 'clay' based on a mechanical\r\nseparation of the coarser ingredients followed by an analysis of the\r\nfiner ones and a calculation of the probable constituents of the latter,\r\nas already described, is known as a _proximate analysis_ in order to\r\ndistinguish it from an _ultimate analysis_ which states the composition\r\nof the whole material in terms of its ultimate oxides. A proximate\r\nanalysis therefore shows the various materials entering into the\r\ncomposition of the clay in the following or similar terms:\r\n\r\n  Stones                per cent.\r\n  Gravel                    \"\r\n  Coarse sand               \"\r\n  Medium sand               \"\r\n  Fine sand                 \"\r\n  Silt                      \"\r\n  Felspar or mica dust      \"\r\n  Silica dust               \"\r\n  'True clay[12]'           \"\r\n  Moisture                  \"\r\n  Carbon                    \"\r\n  Other volatile matter     \"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: In analytical reports a note should be appended stating\r\nthat the figure under this term shows the proportion of the nearest\r\napproximation to true clay at present attainable.]\r\n\r\nFor some purposes it is necessary to show the proportion of calcium,\r\niron and other compounds as in an ordinary ultimate analysis.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the foregoing with an ultimate or 'ordinary' analysis of\r\na clay (p. 16) will show at once the advantage of the former in\r\nincreasing our knowledge of the essential constituent of all clays, if\r\nsuch a substance really exists. Its absolute existence is by no means\r\nproved, for, as will have been noticed, its composition is largely based\r\non assumption even in the most thorough investigations, particularly of\r\nthe admittedly less pure clays.\r\n\r\nIn the purer clays the problem is much simpler and in their case an\r\nanswer of at least approximate accuracy can be given to the question\r\n'What is clay?'\r\n\r\nEven with these purer clays it is not sufficient to study an analysis\r\nshowing the total amount of the silica, alumina and other oxides\r\npresent; it is still necessary to effect some kind of separation into\r\nthe various minerals of which they are composed. When, however, the\r\naccessory minerals do not exceed 5 per cent. of the total ingredients\r\ntheir influence is less important and the nature and characteristics of\r\nthe 'clay substance' itself can be more accurately studied. By careful\r\ntreatment of well selected china clays, for example, it is possible to\r\nobtain a material corresponding to the formula Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O\r\nwithin a total error of 1 per cent., the small amount of impurity\r\nbeing, as far as can be ascertained, composed of mica. So pure a\r\nspecimen of clay is found on microscopical examination to consist of\r\nminute irregular grains of no definite form, together with a few\r\ncrystals of the same composition and identifiable as the mineral\r\n'kaolinite' (p. 107). This 'amorphous' material, which appears to be the\r\nchief constituent of all china clays and kaolins, has been termed\r\n_clayite_ by Mellor (22).\r\n\r\nJohnson and Blake, Aron and other observers have stated that the\r\nmajority of the particles in china clays and kaolins are crystalline in\r\nform. Owing to their extreme smallness it is exceedingly difficult to\r\nprove that they are not so, though for all ordinary purposes they may be\r\nregarded as amorphous, the proportion of obviously crystalline matter\r\npresent in British china clay of the highest qualities being so small as\r\nto be negligible.\r\n\r\nHickling (36), using an exceptionally powerful microscope, claims to\r\nhave identified this 'amorphous' substance in china clay as 'worn and\r\nfragmental crystals of kaolinite,' and recently Mellor and Holdcroft and\r\nRieke have shown that the apparently amorphous material shows the same\r\nendo- and exothermal reactions as crystalline kaolinite.\r\n\r\nSo far as china clays or kaolins are concerned, kaolinite or an\r\namorphous substance of the same composition appears to be identical with\r\nthe 'ideal clay' or 'true clay' whose characters have so long been\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nThis term--clayite--is very convenient when confined to china clays and\r\nkaolins, but it is scarcely legitimate to apply it, as has been\r\nsuggested, to material in other clays until it has been isolated in a\r\nsufficiently pure form to enable its properties to be accurately\r\nstudied. This restriction is the more necessary as in one very important\r\nrespect clayite obtained from china clay and some kaolins differs\r\nnoticeably from the nearest approach to it obtainable from the more\r\nplastic clays: namely, in its very low plasticity. This may be explained\r\nby the fact that it is only obtainable in a reasonably pure form in\r\nclays of a primary character, whilst the plastic clays have usually been\r\ntransported over considerable areas and have been subjected to a variety\r\nof treatments which have had a marked effect on their physical\r\ncharacter. Moreover, the fact that the purest 'clay' which can be\r\nisolated from plastic clays appears to be amorphous and to some extent\r\ncolloidal greatly increases the difficulty of obtaining it in a pure\r\nstate, especially as no liquid is known which will dissolve it without\r\ndecomposing it. The fact that it is not an elementary substance, but a\r\ncomplex compound of silica, alumina and the elements of water, also\r\nincreases the intricacy of the problem, for these substances occur in\r\nother combinations in a variety of other minerals which are clearly\r\ndistinct from clay.\r\n\r\nEver since the publication of Seger's memorable papers (7), and to a\r\nsmall extent before that time, it has been generally understood that\r\nchina clay or kaolin represented the true essential constituent of\r\nclays, but several investigators have been so imbued with the idea that\r\nall true clay substance must have a crystalline form that they have\r\nfrequently used the term 'kaolinite' to include the 'amorphous'\r\nsubstance in plastic clays. This is unfortunate as it is by no means\r\nproved that the latter is identical with kaolinite, and a distinctive\r\nterm would be of value in preventing confusion. Other investigators have\r\nused the word 'kaolin' with equal freeness, so that whilst it originally\r\nreferred to material from a particular hill or ridge in China[13] it has\r\nnow entered into general use for all clays whose composition\r\napproximates to that of china clay (p. 16) in which the plasticity is\r\nnot well developed. Thus, in spite of the difference in origin between\r\nmany German and French kaolins and the china clays of Cornwall, it is\r\nthe custom in Europe generally to term all these materials 'kaolin.' Yet\r\nthey are very different in many respects from the material originally\r\nimported from China.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Kao-ling_ is Chinese for a high ridge or hill.]\r\n\r\nAs the essential clay substance has not yet been isolated in a pure form\r\nfrom the most widely spread plastic clays, but is largely hypothetical\r\nas far as they are concerned, the author prefers the term\r\n_pelinite_[14] when referring to that portion of any plastic clays or\r\nmixtures of clays with other minerals which may be regarded as being the\r\nconstituent to which the argillaceous portion of the material owes its\r\nchief properties. In china clay and kaolin the 'true clay' is identical\r\nwith clayite--or even with kaolinite (p. 108)--and there is great\r\nprobability that this identity also holds in the case of the more\r\nplastic clays of other geological formations, but until it is\r\nestablished it appears wisest to distinguish the hypothetical or ideal\r\nclay common to all clays (if there is such a substance) by different\r\nterms according to the extent to which its composition and characters of\r\nthe materials most closely resembling it are experimentally known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: From the [Greek: pêlinos] = made of clay.]\r\n\r\nThe substances most resembling this 'ideal clay' which have, up to the\r\npresent been isolated, are:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Kaolinite._ Found in a crystalline form in china clays and\r\nkaolins (p. 107).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Clayite._ A material of the same chemical composition as\r\nkaolinite, but whose crystalline nature (if it be crystalline) has not\r\nbeen identified--chiefly obtained from china clays and kaolins.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Pelinite._ A material similar to clayite, but differing from it\r\nin being highly plastic and, to some extent, of a colloidal\r\nnature--obtained from plastic clays.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Laterite._ A material resembling clayite in physical appearance,\r\nbut containing free alumina and free silica (p. 80).\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Clay Substance._ A general term indicating any of the foregoing\r\nor a mixture of them; it is also applied (unwisely) to the material\r\nobtained when a natural clay is freed from its coarser impurities by\r\nelutriation (p. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chief Characteristics of 'True Clay' from Different Sources.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it can be isolated _true clay_ appears to be an amorphous,\r\nor practically amorphous, material which may under suitable conditions\r\ncrystallize into rhombic plates of kaolinite. The particles of which it\r\nis composed are extremely small, being always less than 0·0004 in. in\r\ndiameter. They adsorb dyes from solutions and show other properties\r\ncharacteristic of colloid substances though in a very variable degree,\r\nsome clays appearing to contain a much larger proportion of colloidal\r\nmatter than do others. To some extent the power of adsorption of salts\r\nand colouring matters appears to be connected with the plasticity (p.\r\n41) of the material, but this latter property varies so greatly in\r\nclayite or pelinite from different sources as to make any generalization\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nTrue clay substance appears to be quite white, any colour present being\r\nalmost invariably traceable to ferric compounds or to carbonaceous\r\nmatter. The latter is of small importance to potters as it burns away in\r\nthe kiln. The specific gravity of clay substance is 2·65 according to\r\nHecht, the lower figures sometimes reported being too low. Its hardness\r\nis usually less than that of talc--the softest substance on Mohs'\r\nscale--but some shales are so indurated as to scratch quartz. It is\r\nquite insoluble in water and in dilute solutions of acids or alkalies,\r\nbut is decomposed by hydrofluoric acid and by concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid when heated, alumina entering into solution and silica being\r\nprecipitated in a colloidal condition.\r\n\r\nIt absorbs water easily until a definite state of saturation has been\r\nreached, after which it becomes impervious unless the proportion of\r\nwater is so large and the time of exposure so great that the material\r\nfalls to an irregular mass which may be converted into a slurry of\r\nuniform consistency by gently stirring it. With a moderate amount of\r\nwater, pelinite develops sufficient plasticity to enable it to be\r\nmodelled with facility, but clayite and some specimens of pelinite are\r\nsomewhat deficient in this respect. The pelinitic particles usually\r\npossess the capacity to retain their plasticity after being mixed with\r\nconsiderable proportions of sand or other non-plastic material and are\r\nthen said to possess a high binding power (p. 28).\r\n\r\nIf a large proportion of water is added to a sample of clayite or\r\npelinite and the mixture is stirred into a slurry it will be found to\r\nremain turbid for a considerable time and will not become perfectly\r\nclear even after the lapse of several days. Its power of remaining in\r\nsuspension is much influenced by the presence of even small amounts of\r\nsoluble salts in either the water or the clay substance, its\r\nprecipitation being hastened by the addition of such salts as cause a\r\npartial coagulation of the colloidal matter present. Some specimens of\r\nclayite and pelinite retain their suspensibility even in the presence of\r\nsalts, but this is only true of a very limited proportion of the\r\nsubstance. In most cases the presence of soluble salts causes the larger\r\nparticles to sink somewhat rapidly and to carry the finer particles with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which a slip or 'cream' made of elutriated clay and water\r\nwill flow through a small orifice is dependent on the viscosity of the\r\nliquid and this in turn depends on the amount of colloidal material\r\npresent, _i.e._ on how much of the clay (pelinite) is in a colloidal\r\nform. Its viscosity is greatly affected by the addition or presence of\r\nsmall quantities of acid or alkali or of acidic or basic salts. Acids\r\nincrease the viscosity; alkalies and basic salts, on the contrary, make\r\nthe slip more fluid. Neutral salts behave in different ways according to\r\nthe concentration of the solution and to the amount of clay (pelinite)\r\npresent in the slip. If the slip contains so little water as to be in\r\nthe form of a thin paste, neutral salts usually have but a small action,\r\nbut when the slip contains only a small proportion of clay (pelinite)\r\nthe presence of neutral salts will tend to cause the precipitation of\r\nthe clay. In this way salts act in two quite different directions\r\naccording to the concentration of the slip.\r\n\r\nOn drying a paste made of clay and water the volume gradually diminishes\r\nuntil the greater part of the water has been removed; after this the\r\nremainder of the water may be driven off without any further reduction\r\nin volume of the material. This is another characteristic common to\r\ncolloidal substances such as gelatin. The material when drying attains a\r\nleathery consistency which is at a maximum at the moment when the\r\nshrinkage is about to cease; on further drying the material becomes\r\nharder and more closely resembles stone.\r\n\r\nProviding that wet clay is not heated to a temperature higher than that\r\nof boiling water it appears to undergo no chemical change and on cooling\r\nit will again take up water[15] and be restored to its original\r\ncondition except in so far as its colloidal nature may have been\r\naffected by the heating. If, however, the temperature is raised to about\r\n500° C. a decomposition of the material commences and water is evolved.\r\nThis water--which is commonly termed 'combined water'--is apparently an\r\nessential part of the clay-molecule and when once it has been removed\r\nthe most important characteristics of the clay are destroyed and cannot\r\nbe restored. The reactions which occur when clay is heated are complex\r\nand are rendered still more difficult to study by the apparent\r\npolymerization of the alumina formed. Mellor and Holdcroft (29) have\r\nrecently investigated the heat reactions of the purest china clay\r\nobtainable and confirm Le Chatelier's view (10) that on heating to\r\ntemperatures above 500° C. clay substance decomposes into free silica,\r\nfree alumina and water, the two former undergoing a partial\r\nre-combination with formation of sillimanite (Al2O3SiO2) if a\r\ntemperature of 1200° C. is reached. Mellor and Holdcroft point out that\r\nthere is no critical point of decomposition for clay substance obtained\r\nfrom china clay, as it appears to lose water at all temperatures, though\r\nits decomposition proceeds at so slow a rate below 400° C. as to be\r\nscarcely appreciable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Some clays are highly hygroscopic and absorb moisture\r\nreadily from the atmosphere. According to Seger (7) this hygroscopicity\r\ndistinguishes true clay from silt and dust.]\r\n\r\nAfter the whole of the 'combined water' has been driven off, if the\r\ntemperature continues to rise, it is found that at a temperature of 900°\r\nC. an evolution of heat occurs. This exothermal point, together with the\r\nendothermal one occurring at the temperature at which the decomposition\r\nof the clay seems to be most rapid, has been found by Le Chatelier,\r\nconfirmed by Mellor and Holdcroft, to be characteristic of clay\r\nsubstance derived from kaolin and china clay, and the two last-named\r\ninvestigators state that it serves as a means of distinguishing\r\nkaolinite or clayite from other alumino-silicates of similar\r\ncomposition. These thermal reactions have not, as yet, been fully\r\nstudied in connection with plastic clays; with china clay, as already\r\nnoted, they probably indicate a polymerization of the alumina set free\r\nby the decomposition of the clay substance, as pure alumina from a\r\nvariety of sources has been found by Mellor and Holdcroft to behave\r\nsimilarly.\r\n\r\nOn still further raising the temperature of pure clay (pelinite or\r\nclayite) no further reactions of importance occur, the material being\r\npractically infusible. If, however, any silica, lime, magnesia,\r\nalkalies, iron oxide or other material capable of combining with the\r\nalumina and silica is present as impurities in the clay substance,\r\ncombination begins at temperatures above 900° C. This causes a reduction\r\nof the heat-resisting power of the material; the silicates and\r\nalumino-silicates produced fuse and begin to react on the remaining\r\nsilica and alumina, first forming an impermeable mass in place of the\r\nporous one produced with pure clay substance, and gradually, as the\r\nmaterial loses its shape, producing a molten slag if the 'clay' is\r\nsufficiently impure. As ordinary clays are never quite free from\r\nmetallic compounds other than alumina, this formation of a fused\r\nportion--technically known as _vitrification_ (p. 37)--occurs at\r\ntemperatures depending on the nature of the materials present, so that a\r\nwide range of products is obtained, the series commencing with the\r\nentirely unfused pure clay (china clay), passing through the slightly\r\nvitrified fireclays, the more completely vitrified ball clays to the\r\nvitrifiable stoneware clays and ending with materials so rich in easily\r\nfusible matter as scarcely to be worthy of the name of clays.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the clay molecule is a subject which has attracted\r\nthe attention of many investigators and is being closely studied at the\r\npresent time. It is a subject of peculiar difficulty owing to the\r\ninertness of clay substance at all but high temperatures, and to the\r\ncomplexity of reactions which take place as soon as any reagent is\r\nbrought into active connection with it.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into details regarding the various graphic formulae\r\nwhich have been suggested, it is sufficient to state that the one which\r\nis most probably correct, as far as present knowledge goes, is Mellor's\r\nand Holdcroft's re-arrangement of Groth's formula (30)\r\n\r\n  HO\\     /OSiO\\\r\n     \\Al2/      \\O\r\n     /   \\      /\r\n  HO/ /\\  \\OSiO/\r\n     /  \\\r\n   HO    OH\r\n\r\nwhich on removal of the hydroxyl groups might be expected to give the\r\nanhydride\r\n\r\n  O\\\\     /OSiO\\\r\n    \\\\Al2/      \\\r\n    //   \\      /\r\n  O//     \\OSiO/\r\n\r\n\r\nthough in practice this substance--if formed at all--appears to be\r\ninstantly split up into Al2O3 and SiO2.\r\n\r\nBy regarding the aluminium as a nucleus, as above, and some aluminium\r\nsilicates as hypothetical alumino-silicic acids, as suggested by\r\nUlffers, Scharizer, Morozewicz (29) and others, clay substance may be\r\nconveniently considered, along with analogous substances, as forming a\r\nspecial group quite distinct from the ordinary silicates. In this way\r\nMellor and Holdcroft (29) consider that clay substance is not a hydrated\r\naluminium silicate--as is usually stated in the text-books--but an\r\nalumino-silicic acid, the salts of which are the zeolites and related\r\ncompounds. From this hypothesis it naturally follows that clay substance\r\nis analogous to colloidal silica which has been formed by the\r\ndecomposition of a silicate by means of water and an acid.\r\n\r\nIf this view be correct, pure clay substance or true\r\nclay is a tetra-basic alumino-silicic acid H4Al2SiO9 or\r\nAl2Si2O5(0H4). That its acid properties are not readily\r\nrecognizable at ordinary temperatures is due to its inertness; at higher\r\ntemperatures its power of combination with lime, soda potash and other\r\nbases is well recognized, though the reactions which occur are often\r\ncomplicated by decompositions and molecular re-arrangements which occur\r\nin consequence of the elevated temperature.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of minerals which closely resemble clayite\r\nor pure clay substance in composition, the chief difference\r\nbeing in the proportion of water they evolve on being heated.\r\nThus _Rectorite_ H2Al2Si2O8, _Kaolinite_ H4Al2Si2O9,\r\n_Halloysite_ H6Al2Si2O10 and _Newtonite_ H10Al2Si2O12. In the\r\ncrystalline form these minerals may be distinguished from each other by\r\nmeans of the microscope, but as the chief materials of which clays are\r\ncomposed appears to be amorphous it is impossible to ascertain with\r\ncertainty whether a given specimen of clay substance is composed of a\r\nmixture of these analogous minerals in an amorphous form or whether it\r\nconsists entirely of clayite, _i.e._ the clay substance obtained from\r\nchina clay. As already stated, the thermal reactions which occur on\r\nheating clayite appear to be characteristic of kaolinite whilst\r\nhalloysite is completely decomposed at a temperature somewhat below 200°\r\nC.; but the not improbable presence of two or more of these\r\nalumino-silicic acids in clays of secondary or multary origin makes it\r\nalmost impossible to determine whether clayite is an essential\r\nconstituent of all clays or whether the purest clay substance (pelinite)\r\nobtained from some of the more plastic clays does not possess a\r\ndifferent chemical composition as well as different physical properties.\r\n\r\nThe view that clays may be regarded as impure varieties of clayite is\r\nconsidered erroneous by several investigators for various reasons. For\r\ninstance, felspar is rarely found in china clays, but is a common\r\nconstituent of secondary (plastic) clays. J. M. van Bemmelen (26), who\r\nhas found that the alumina-silica ratio of clays produced by weathering\r\nis always higher than that in clays of the china clay type produced by\r\nhypogenic action. In a number of clays examined he found that a portion\r\nwas soluble in boiling hydrochloric acid whereas clayite is scarcely\r\naffected by this treatment. He also found a varying proportion of\r\nalumino-silicate insoluble in hydrochloric acid but dissolved on\r\ntreatment with boiling sulphuric acid and subsequently with caustic soda\r\nsolution; this latter he considers to be true clayite. Unfortunately,\r\nhis results were obtained by treating the crude clay with acid, instead\r\nof first removing such non-plastic materials as can be separated by\r\nwashing, so that all that they show is that some clays contain\r\nalumino-silicates of a nature distinct from clayite in addition to any\r\nclayite which may be found in them.\r\n\r\nThe fact that all clays when heated to 700 or 800° C. readily react with\r\nlime-water to form the same calcium silicates and aluminates indicates\r\nso close a resemblance between the clay substance obtainable from\r\ndifferent sources as to constitute strong evidence of the identity of\r\nthis substance with clayite or with materials so analogous to it as to\r\nbe indistinguishable from it under present conditions.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, the plastic clays have been derived from a somewhat\r\ngreater variety of minerals than the primary clays (p. 71) and under\r\nconditions of decomposition which differ in details, though broadly of\r\nthe same nature as those producing china clays. The presence of\r\ncolloidal matter suggests a more vigorous action--or even a\r\nprecipitation from solution--instead of the slower reactions which\r\nresult in the formation of the kaolinite crystals.\r\n\r\nThe much smaller particles present in plastic clays also indicate a more\r\ncomplete grinding during the transportation of the material or some form\r\nof precipitation. If, as Hickling suggests, all clays are direct\r\nproducts of the decomposition of _mica_, the fact that several varieties\r\nof mica are known and that the conditions under which these decompose\r\nmust vary considerably, afford a good, if incomplete, explanation of\r\nsome of the widely diverse characteristics observed in different clays.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great complexities of the whole subject and the\r\napparently contradictory evidence concerning some clays, there is a\r\nwide-spread feeling that whatever may be the mineral from which a given\r\nclay has been derived, the _true clay substance_, which is its essential\r\nconstituent, would (if it could be isolated in a pure state) prove to be\r\nof the same composition as kaolinite obtainable from china clay of\r\nexceptional purity. The purest clay substances (pelinite) yet obtained\r\nfrom some of the most plastic clays are, however, so impure as to make\r\nany detailed investigation of their composition by present methods\r\nabortive. The methods of synthesis which have proved so successful in\r\norganic chemistry have hitherto yielded few intelligible results with\r\nclays, on account of the complexity of the accessory reactions which\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Difference between Pure Clay Substance and Ordinary Clays.\r\n\r\nThe properties and characteristics of _true clay_ are very seriously\r\nmodified by other materials which may be associated with it. This may be\r\nperceived by comparing the properties of clays mentioned in Chapter I\r\nwith those of various forms of true clay just given. Moreover, as true\r\nclay never occurs in a perfectly pure state in nature, the properties of\r\nclays must be largely dependent on the accessory ingredients.\r\n\r\nSilica, for example, when alone is a highly refractory material, but in\r\nthe presence of true clay it reduces the refractoriness of the latter.\r\nLime has a similar effect though its chemical action on the clay is\r\nentirely different. A very small proportion of some substances--notably\r\nthe oxides of sodium and potassium--will greatly alter the behaviour of\r\ntrue clay when heated and will produce an impervious mass in place of a\r\nporous one.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is necessary in studying clays to pay attention to\r\nboth their physical and chemical properties and to separate the material\r\ninto fractions so that each of these may be studied separately and their\r\nindividual as well as their collective characteristics ascertained.\r\nFailure to do this has been the cause of much obscurity and confusion in\r\ninvestigations on certain clays composed of a considerable proportion of\r\nnon-argillaceous material which ought to have been separated before any\r\nattempt was made to study the true clay present.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a considerable difference between a natural clay\r\nand the pure clay substance theoretically obtainable from it; this\r\ndifference being most marked in the case of low-grade brick clays of\r\nglacial origin, which may contain 50 per cent. or more of adventitious\r\nmaterials. If used in a natural state they would be found to be\r\nvalueless on account of their impurities giving them characteristics of\r\na highly undesirable character, whereas the true clay in them is\r\nfound--in so far as it can be separated--to bear a close resemblance to\r\nthat obtained from a high grade, plastic, pottery clay. Unfortunately,\r\nit is, at present, impossible to isolate this clay substance in anything\r\napproaching a pure form, and many clays are without commercial value\r\nbecause of comparatively small proportions of impurities which cannot be\r\nseparated from the clay substance without destroying the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of Clays.\r\n\r\nOwing to the widely differing substances from which clays can,\r\napparently, be formed and the peculiar difficulties which are\r\nexperienced in investigating the nature of clay substance from different\r\nsources, it is by no means easy to devise a scheme of classification of\r\nclays, though many of these have been attempted by different scientists.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted by geologists is based on the fossil remains\r\nand on the stratigraphical position of clays relative to other rocks, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter II. This is of great value for some purposes, but\r\nthe composition of the substances termed 'clay' by geologists differs so\r\ngreatly, even when only one formation is considered, as to make their\r\nclassification of little or no use where the value or worthlessness of\r\nthe material depends upon its composition. Thus the so-called Oxford\r\nclay ranges from a hard silicious shale to a comparatively pure clay;\r\nsome portions of it are so contaminated with calcareous and ferruginous\r\nmatter as to make the material quite useless for the potter or\r\nclayworker. A geological classification of clays is chiefly of value as\r\nindicating probable origins, impurities and certain physical properties;\r\nbut the limits of composition and general characteristics are so wide as\r\nto make it of very limited usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe classification of clays on a basis of chemical composition is\r\nrendered of comparatively little value by the large number of clays\r\nwhich occupy ill-defined borders between the more clearly marked\r\nclasses. Moreover, attempts to predict the value and uses of clays from\r\ntheir chemical composition are generally so misleading as to be worse\r\nthan useless, unless a knowledge of some of the physical characters of\r\nthe clays is available. It is, of course, possible to differentiate some\r\nclays from others by their composition, but not with sufficient accuracy\r\nto permit of definite and accurate classification.\r\n\r\nA classification based exclusively on the composition of clays is\r\nequally unsatisfactory for other reasons, the chief of which is the\r\nplacing together of clays of widely differing physical character, and\r\nthe separation of clays capable of being used for a particular purpose.\r\nTo some extent the latter objection may be disregarded, though it is of\r\ngreat importance in considering the commercial value of a clay.\r\n\r\nClassification based on the uses of clays of different kinds has been\r\nsuggested by several eminent ceramists, but is obviously unsatisfactory,\r\nparticularly as it is by no means uncommon to use mixtures of clays and\r\nother minerals for some purposes. Thus stoneware clays must be\r\nvitrifiable under conditions which may be defined with sufficient\r\naccuracy, but many manufacturers of stoneware do not use clays which are\r\nnaturally vitrifiable; they employ a mixture of refractory clay and\r\nother minerals to obtain the material they require.\r\n\r\nA classification based on the origin of clays regarded from the\r\npetrological point of view offers some advantages, but is too cumbersome\r\nfor ordinary purposes and suffers from the disadvantage that the origin\r\nof some important clays is by no means clearly known.\r\n\r\nThe author prefers a modification of Grimsley's and Grout's\r\nclassification (31) as follows:\r\n\r\n    I.  Primary clays.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Clays produced by 'weathering' silicates--as some\r\n            kaolins.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Clays produced by lateritic action--very rich in\r\n            alumina, some of which is apparently in a free state.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Clays produced by telluric water containing active gases\r\n            (hypogenically formed clays)--as Cornish china clay.\r\n\r\n   II.  Secondary clays.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Refractory[16] secondary clays--as fireclays and some\r\n            pipe clays.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Pale-burning non-refractory clays--as pottery clays,\r\n            ball clays and some shales.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Vitrifiable clays--as stoneware clays, paving brick\r\n            clays.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Red-burning and non-refractory clays--as brick and\r\n            terra-cotta clays and shales.\r\n\r\n    (_h_) Calcareous clays or marls, including all clays\r\n            containing more than 5 per cent. of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n  III.  Residual clays.\r\n\r\n    (_i_) Clays which have been formed by one of the foregoing\r\n            actions and have been deposited along with calcareous or\r\n            other matter but, on the latter being removed by subsequent\r\n            solution, the clay has remained behind--as the white clays\r\n            of the Derbyshire hills.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: A refractory clay is one which does not soften\r\nsufficiently to commence losing its shape at any temperature below that\r\nneeded to bend Seger Cone 26 (approximately 1600°C.) (see p. 116).]\r\n\r\nSome further sub-division is necessary for special purposes,\r\nparticularly in sections _e_, _f_ and _h_, but to include further\r\ndetails would only obscure the general scheme. Some clays will,\r\napparently, be capable of classification in more than one section, thus\r\na vitrifiable clay may owe its characteristic to a high proportion of\r\ncalcium carbonate and so be capable of inclusion as a calcareous clay.\r\nBroadly speaking, however, if the clay is tested as to its inclusion in\r\neach section of the scheme in turn it will be found that its highest\r\nvalue will be in the section which is nearest to the first in which the\r\nclay can legitimately be placed.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of a classification such as the foregoing, together\r\nwith a detailed study of the physical and chemical properties of the\r\nmaterial as a whole, and also of the various portions into which it may\r\nbe divided--particularly that which has been isolated by mechanical\r\nmethods of purification and separation--it is not difficult to gain a\r\nfairly accurate idea of the nature of any clay. Although the present\r\nstate of knowledge does not permit them to be classified with such\r\ndetail as is the case with plants, animals, or simple chemical\r\ncompounds, the study of clays and the allied materials has a fascination\r\npeculiarly its own, not the least interesting features of which are\r\nthose properties of the clay after it has been made into articles of use\r\nor ornament. These are, however, beyond the scope of what is commonly\r\nunderstood by the term 'the natural history of clay.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nA complete bibliography of clay would occupy several volumes.
