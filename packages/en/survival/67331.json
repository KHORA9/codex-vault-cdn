The obscurity of these\r\nhas been often complained of; and thence, no doubt, it has arisen,\r\nthat so little attention has been paid to the ingenious and original\r\nspeculations which they contain.\r\n\r\nTHE simplest way of accomplishing the object proposed, seemed to be, to\r\npresent a General Outline of the System, in one continued Discourse;\r\nand to introduce afterwards, in the form of Notes, what farther\r\nelucidation any particular subject was thought to demand. Through the\r\nwhole, I have aimed at little more than a clear exposition of facts,\r\nand a plain deduction of the conclusions grounded on them; nor shall\r\nI claim any merit to myself, if, in the order which I have found it\r\nnecessary to adopt, some arguments may have taken a new form, and some\r\nadditions may have been made to a system naturally rich in the number\r\nand variety of its illustrations.\r\n\r\nOF the qualifications which this undertaking requires, there is one\r\nthat I may safely suppose my self to possess. Having been instructed by\r\nDi Hutton himself in his theory of the earth; having lived in intimate\r\nfriendship with that excellent man for several years, and almost in the\r\ndaily habit of discussing the questions here treated of; I have had the\r\nbest opportunity of understanding his views, and becoming acquainted\r\nwith his peculiarities, whether of expression or of thought. In the\r\nother qualifications necessary for the illustration o a system so\r\nextensive and various, I am abundantly sensible of my deficiency, and\r\nshall therefore with great deference, and considerable anxiety wait\r\nthat decision from which there is no appeal.\r\n\r\n  EDINBURGH COLLEGE, }\r\n    1st March 1802.  }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE\r\n\r\n                                  OF\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION.

If to this we\r\nadd, that many masses of rock, the most solid and compact, consist of\r\nno other materials but sand and gravel; that, on the other hand, loose\r\ngravel, such as is formed only in beds of rivers, or on the sea shore,\r\nnow abounds in places remote from both: if we reflect, at the same\r\ntime, on the irregular and broken figure of our continents, and the\r\nidentity of the mineral strata on opposite sides of the same valley, or\r\nthe same inlet of the sea; we shall see abundant reason to conclude,\r\nthat the earth has been the theatre of many great revolutions, and that\r\nnothing on its surface has been exempted from their effects.\r\n\r\nTo trace the series of these revolutions, to explain their causes, and\r\nthus to connect together all the indications of change that are found\r\nin the mineral kingdom, is the proper object of a THEORY OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nBut, though the attention of men may be turned to the theory of the\r\nearth by a very superficial acquaintance with the phenomena of geology,\r\nthe formation of such a theory requires an accurate and extensive\r\nexamination of those phenomena, and is inconsistent with any but a\r\nvery advanced state of the physical sciences. There is, perhaps, in\r\nthose sciences, no research more arduous than this; none certainly\r\nwhere the subject is so complex; where the appearances are so extremely\r\ndiversified, or so widely scattered, and where the causes that have\r\noperated are so remote from the sphere of ordinary observation. Hence\r\nthe attempt! to form a theory of the earth are of very modern origin,\r\nand as, from the simplicity of its subject astronomy is the eldest, so,\r\non account of the complexness of its subject, geology is the youngest\r\nof the sciences.\r\n\r\nIt is foreign from the present purpose to enter on any history of\r\nthe systems that, since the rise of this branch of science, have\r\nbeen invented to explain the phenomena of the mineral kingdom. It is\r\nsufficient to remark, that these systems are usually reduced to two\r\nclasses, according as they refer the origin of terrestrial bodies\r\nto FIRE or to WATER; and that, conformably to this division, their\r\nfollowers have of late been distinguished by the fanciful names of\r\n_Vulcanists_ and _Neptunists_. To the former of these Dr Hutton belongs\r\nmuch more than to the latter; though, as he employs the agency both of\r\nfire and of water in his system, he cannot, in strict propriety, be\r\narranged with either.\r\n\r\nIn the succinct account which I am now about to give of this system, I\r\nshall consider the mineral kingdom as divided into two parts, namely,\r\nstratified and unstratified substances I shall treat, first, of the\r\nphenomena peculiar to the stratified; next, of those peculiar to the\r\nunstratified; and, lastly, of the phenomena common to both. Beginning,\r\nthen, with the first, the subject naturally divides itself into three\r\nbranches; viz. the _materials_ the _consolidation_, and the _position_\r\nof the strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION I.\r\n\r\n            OF THE PHENOMENA PECULIAR TO STRATIFIED BODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1. _Materials of the Strata._\r\n\r\n1. IT is well known that, on removing the loose earth which forms the\r\nimmediate surface of the land, we come to the solid rock, of which a\r\ngreat proportion is found to be regularly disposed in strata, or beds\r\nof determinate thickness, inclined at different angles to the horizon,\r\nbut separated from one another by equidistant superficies, that often\r\nmaintain their parallelism to a great extent. These strata bear such\r\nevident marks of being deposited by water, that they are universally\r\nacknowledged to have had their origin at the bottom of the sea; and\r\nit is also admitted, that the materials which they consist of, were\r\nthen either soft, or in such a state of comminution and separation,\r\nas renders them capable of arrangement by the action of the water in\r\nwhich they were immersed. Thus far most of the theories of the earth\r\nagree; but from this point they begin to diverge, and each to assume\r\na character and direction peculiar to itself. Dr Hutton's does so, by\r\nlaying down this fundamental proposition, That in all the strata we\r\ndiscover proofs of the materials having existed as elements of bodies,\r\nwhich must have been destroyed before the formation of those of which\r\nthese materials now actually make a part.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hutton's Theory, vol. I p. 20, &c.]\r\n\r\n2. The calcareous strata are the portion of the mineral kingdom that\r\ngives the clearest testimony to the truth of this assertion. They often\r\ncontain shells, corals, and other exuviæ of marine animals in so great\r\nabundance, that they appear to be composed of no other materials.\r\nThough these remains of organized bodies are now converted into stone\r\nor into spar, their shape and interior structure are often so well\r\npreserved, that the species of animal or plant of which they once made\r\na part, can still be distinguished and pointed out among the living\r\ninhabitants of the ocean.\r\n\r\nOthers of the calcareous strata appear to be composed of fragments of\r\nsome ancient rocks, which, after having been broken, have been again\r\nunited into a compact stone. In these we find pieces clearly marked\r\nas having been once continuous but now placed at a distance from one\r\nanother, and exhibiting exactly the same appearances as if they floated\r\nin a fluid of the same specific gravity with themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom these, therefore, and a variety of similar appearances, Dr Hutton\r\nconcludes, that the materials of all the calcareous strata have been\r\nfurnished, either from the dissolution of former strata, or from the\r\nremains of organized bodies. But, though this conclusion is meant to be\r\nextended to all the calcareous strata, it is not asserted that every\r\ncubic inch of marble or of limestone contains in it the characters of\r\nits former condition, and of the changes through which it has passed.\r\nIt may, however, be safely affirmed, that there is scarce any entire\r\nstratum where such characters are not to be found. These must be\r\nheld as decisive with respect to the whole system of strata to which\r\nthey belong; they prove the existence of calcareous rocks before the\r\nformation of the present; and, as the destruction of those is evidently\r\nadequate to the supply of the materials of these that we now see, to\r\nlook for any other supply were superfluous, and could only embarrass\r\nour reasonings by the introduction of unnecessary hypotheses.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: NOTE I.]\r\n\r\n3. The same conclusions result from an examination of the siliceous\r\nstrata; under which we may comprehend the common sandstone, and also\r\nthose pudding-stones or breccias where the gravel consists of quartz.\r\nIn all these instances, it is plain, that the sand or gravel existed in\r\na state quite loose and unconnected, at the bottom of the sea, previous\r\nto its consolidation into stone. But such bodies of gravel or sand\r\ncould only be formed from the attrition of large masses of quartz, or\r\nfrom the dissolution of such sandstone strata as exist at present; for\r\nit will hardly be alleged, that sand is a crystallization of quartz,\r\nformed from that substance, when it passes from a fluid to a solid\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThose pudding-stones in which the gravel is round and polished, carry\r\nthe conclusion still farther, as such gravel can only be formed in the\r\nbeds of rivers or on the shores of the sea; for, in the depths of the\r\nocean, though currents are known to exist, yet there can be no motion\r\nof the water sufficiently rapid to produce the attrition required to\r\ngive a round figure and smooth surface to hard and irregular pieces\r\nof stone. There must have existed, therefore, not only a sea, but\r\ncontinents, previously to the formation of the present strata.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is clearly shown by those petrifactions of wood, where,\r\nthough the vegetable structure is perfectly preserved, the whole mass\r\nis siliceous, and has, perhaps, been found in the heart of some\r\nmountain, deep imbedded in the solid rock.\r\n\r\n4. Characters of the same import are also found among the argillaceous\r\nstrata, though perhaps more rarely than among the calcareous or\r\nsiliceous. Such are the impressions of the leaves and stems of\r\nvegetables; also the bodies of fish and amphibious animals, found very\r\noften in the different kinds of argillaceous schistus, and in most\r\ninstances having the figure accurately preserved, but the substance\r\nof the animal replaced by clay or pyrites. These are all remains\r\nof ancient seas or continents; the latter of which have long since\r\ndisappeared from the surface of the earth, but have still their memory\r\npreserved in those archives, where nature has recorded the revolutions\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\n5. Among bituminous bodies, pit-coal is the only one which constitutes\r\nregular and extensive strata; and no fossil has its origin from the\r\nwaste of former continents, marked by stronger and more distinct\r\ncharacters. Not to mention that the coal strata are alternated with\r\nthose that have been already enumerated, and that they often contain\r\nshells and corals, perfectly mineralized, it is sufficient to remark,\r\nthat there are entire beds of this fossil, which appear to consist\r\nwholly of wood, and in which the fibrous structure is perfectly\r\npreserved. From these instances, the appearances of vegetable\r\nstructure may be traced through all possible gradations, down to an\r\nevanescent state. This last state is undoubtedly the most common; and\r\nthough coal does not then, on bare inspection, make known its vegetable\r\norigin, yet, if we take it in connection with the other terms of the\r\nseries, as we may call them; if we consider that the two extremes, viz.\r\ncoal, with the vegetable structure perfect, and coal without any such\r\nstructure visible, are often found in the same or in contiguous beds;\r\nand, if we remark, that through all these gradations coal contains\r\nnearly the same chemical elements, and yields, on analysis, bitumen and\r\ncharcoal, combined with a greater or less proportion of earth: if we\r\ntake all these circumstances into account, we cannot doubt that this\r\nfossil is every where the same, and derives its origin from the trees\r\nand plants that grew on the surface of the earth before the formation\r\nof the present land.\r\n\r\n6. Dr Hutton has further observed, that if those ancient continents\r\nwere at all similar to the present, we can be at no loss to account for\r\nthe want of any distinct mark of vegetable organization in the greater\r\npart of the coal strata. It is plain, that the daily waste of animal\r\nand vegetable substances on the surface of the earth, must disengage\r\na great quantity of oily as well as carbonic matter, which, with\r\nwhatever element it is at first combined, is ultimately delivered into\r\nthe ocean. Thus, the oily or fuliginous parts of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances, let loose by burning, first ascend into the atmosphere, but\r\nare at length precipitated, and either fall immediately into the sea,\r\nor are, in part at least, washed down into it from the land. From other\r\ncauses also, much vegetable matter is carried down by the rivers; and\r\nthe whole quantity of animal and vegetable substances thus delivered\r\ninto the sea, must be very considerable, amounting annually to the\r\nwhole residuum of those substances, not employed in the maintenance or\r\nreproduction of animal and vegetable bodies. Whether chemically united\r\nto the waters of the ocean, or simply suspended in them, this matter is\r\nat last precipitated, and, mingling with earthy substances, is formed\r\ninto strata, the place of which will be determined by the currents, the\r\nposition of the present continents, and many other circumstances not\r\neasily enumerated.\r\n\r\nIf, then, an order of things similar to what we now see, existed before\r\nthe formation of the present strata, it would necessarily happen, that\r\nthe animal and vegetable substances, diffused through the ocean, being\r\nseparated from the water, would be deposited at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and, in the course of ages, would form beds, less or more pure,\r\naccording to the quantity of earth and other substances deposited\r\nat the same time. These beds being consolidated and mineralized by\r\noperations that are afterwards to be considered, have been converted\r\ninto pit-coal, the parts of which are impalpable, and retain nothing of\r\ntheir primitive structure.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: NOTE II.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the formation of coal from animal and vegetable bodies be\r\nadmitted, the general position which derives the origin of the strata\r\nfrom the waste of former land, as it is applicable to all the kinds\r\nalready enumerated, and of course to all those with which they are\r\nalternated, comprehends a very large portion of the earth's surface.\r\nIt comprehends, indeed, all the strata usually distinguished by the\r\nname of _Secondary_; but there is another great division of the mineral\r\nkingdom, viz. the rocks, called _Primitive_, which, as they are never\r\nalternated with the secondary, but are always inferior to them, must\r\nbe further examined, before we can decide whether the same conclusion\r\nextends to them or not.\r\n\r\n7. Here it must be carefully observed, that, among the primary rocks,\r\nthe granite is not meant to be included, except where that stone is\r\nstratified, and either coincides with veined granite or with gneiss.\r\nThe primitive strata, in Dr Hutton's theory, comprehend, besides\r\ngneiss, the micaceous, chlorite, hornblende, and siliceous schistus,\r\ntogether with slate, and some other kinds of argillite; to which we\r\nmust add, serpentine, micaceous limestone, and the greater part of\r\nmarbles. These are mostly distinguished by their laminated structure,\r\nby having their planes much elevated with respect to the horizon,\r\nand by belonging more to the mountainous than the level parts of the\r\nearth's surface. They rarely contain vestiges of organized bodies;\r\nso rarely, indeed, that they were called primitive by the geologists\r\nwho first distinguished them from other rocks, on the supposition of\r\ntheir being part of the primeval nucleus of the globe, which had never\r\nundergone any change whatsoever; but this, I believe, has now almost\r\nceased to be the opinion of any geologist.[4] The Neptunists hold the\r\nrocks, here enumerated, and also granite, to be produced by aqueous\r\ndeposition; but maintain them to be in the strictest sense primeval,\r\nand of a formation antecedent to all organized bodies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: NOTE III.]\r\n\r\n8. In opposition to this, Dr Hutton maintained, that the primary\r\nschistus, like all the other strata, was formed of materials deposited\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and collected from the waste of rocks still\r\nmore ancient. When, therefore, he conformed to the received language\r\nof mineralogists, by calling these strata primitive, he only meant\r\nto describe them as more ancient than any other strata now existing,\r\nbut not as more ancient than any that ever had existed. They are\r\ndistinguished, in his system, by the name of _Primary_, rather than of\r\n_Primitive_ strata.\r\n\r\nThat the account now given of their origin is well founded, may be\r\nproved by unquestionable facts. For, first, though, agreeably to the\r\nobservation just made, the ancient strata do but rarely contain any\r\nremains of organized bodies, they are not entirely destitute of them.\r\nDifferent places in this island have been pointed out by Dr Hutton,\r\nwhere marine objects have been discovered in primary limestone, either\r\nby himself or others, and it would not be difficult to add more\r\ninstances of the same kind.[5] In Dauphine, coal, which is certainly a\r\nderivative substance, has been found among mountains which have a title\r\nto the character of primitive, such as no one will dispute. These facts\r\nput the composition of such rocks from loose materials, beyond all\r\ndoubt, and also prove their formation to be posterior to the existence\r\nof an animal and vegetable system. They do indeed prove this in the\r\nstrictest sense, only of the particular beds in which they are found;\r\nbut as these beds are in all other respects as much to be accounted\r\nprimary as any part of the mineral kingdom, it is evident that the\r\nnegative instances are here of no force, and that nothing can be gained\r\nto the adversaries of this opinion by denying it in general, if they\r\nare obliged to admit it in a single case.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: NOTE IV.]\r\n\r\n9. Again, it is certain, as Dr Hutton remarks, that there are few\r\nconsiderable bodies of schistus, even the most decidedly primitive,\r\nwhere sand and gravel may not in some parts be observed. Indeed, it is\r\nnot only true that they are to be found in some parts of them; but,\r\nin fact, among many of the primitive mountains, we find large tracts,\r\ncomposed entirely of a schistose and much indurated sandstone, in beds\r\nhighly inclined, sometimes alone, sometimes alternated with other\r\nschisti. In many of them, the sand of which they consist appears to be\r\nentirely of granite, from the detritus of which rock it should seem\r\nthat they were chiefly formed.\r\n\r\n10. Thus we conclude, that the strata both primary and secondary,\r\nboth those of ancient and those of more recent origin, have had their\r\nmaterials furnished from the ruins of former continents, from the\r\ndissolution of rocks, or the destruction of animal or vegetable\r\nbodies, similar, at least in some respects, to those that now occupy\r\nthe surface of the earth. This conclusion is not indeed proved of every\r\nindividual portion of rock, but it is demonstrated of many and large\r\nparts, and those scattered indifferently through all the varieties of\r\nthe strata; and therefore, from the rules of the strictest reasoning,\r\nwe must infer, that the whole is derived from the same origin.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: NOTE V.]\r\n\r\nThus far concerning the materials of the strata; and, as these were\r\noriginally loose and unconnected, we must next consider by what means\r\nthey were consolidated into stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   2. _Consolidation of the Strata_.\r\n\r\n11. Though Dr Hutton has no where defined the meaning of the term\r\nconsolidation, he has been scrupulously exact in using it constantly\r\nin the same sense. He understands by it, not merely that quality in a\r\nhard body, by which its parts cohere together, but also that by which\r\nit fills up the space comprehended within its surface, being to sense\r\nwithout porosity, and impervious to air and moisture.\r\n\r\nNow, a porous mass of unconnected materials, such as the strata appear\r\noriginally to have been, can acquire hardness and solidity only in two\r\nways, that is, either when it is first reduced by heat into a state of\r\nfusion, or at least of softness, and afterwards permitted to cool; or\r\nwhen matter that is dissolved in some fluid menstruum, is introduced\r\nalong with that menstruum into the porous mass, and, being deposited,\r\nforms a cement by which the whole is rendered firm and compact. Fire\r\nand water, therefore, are the only two physical agents to which we can\r\nascribe the consolidation of the strata; and, in order to determine to\r\nwhich of them that effect is to be attributed, we must inquire whether\r\nthere are any certain characters that distinguish the action of the one\r\nfrom that of the other, and which may be compared with the phenomena\r\nactually observed among mineral substances.\r\n\r\n12. First, then, it is evident, that the consolidation produced by the\r\naction of water, or of another fluid menstruum, in the manner just\r\nreferred to, must necessarily be imperfect, and can never entirely\r\nbanish the porosity of the mass. For the bulk of the solvent, and of\r\nthe matter it contained in solution, being greater than the bulk of\r\neither taken singly, when the latter was deposited, the former would\r\nhave sufficient room left, and would continue to occupy a certain\r\nspace in the interior of the strata. A liquid solvent, therefore, could\r\nnever shut up the pores of a body to the entire exclusion of itself;\r\nand, had mineral substances been consolidated, as here supposed, the\r\nsolvent ought either to remain within them in a liquid state, or if\r\nevaporated, should have left the pores empty and the body pervious to\r\nwater. Neither of these however, is the fact; many stratified bodies\r\nare perfectly impervious to water, and few mineral substances contain\r\nwater in a liquid state. That they sometimes contain it, chemically\r\nunited to them, is no proof of their solidity having been brought\r\nabout by that fluid; for such chemical union is as consistent with the\r\nsupposition of igneous as of aqueous consolidation, since the region in\r\nwhich the fire was applied, on every hypothesis must have abounded with\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\n13. Again, if water was the solvent by which the consolidating matter\r\nwas introduced into the interstices of the strata, that matter could\r\nconsist only of such substances as are soluble in water, whereas\r\nit consists of a vast variety of substances, altogether insoluble\r\neither in it, or in any single menstruum whatsoever. The strata are\r\nconsolidated, for example, by quartz, by fluor, by feldspar, and by all\r\nthe metals, in their endless combinations with sulphureous bodies. To\r\naffirm that water was ever capable of dissolving these substances, is\r\nto ascribe to it powers which it confessedly has not at present; and,\r\ntherefore, it is to introduce an hypothesis, not merely gratuitous, but\r\none which, physically speaking, is absurd and impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is not all, however; for, even if this difficulty were to be\r\npassed over, it would still be required to explain, how the water,\r\nwhich, together with the matter which it held in solution, had\r\ninsinuated itself into the pores of the strata, became suddenly\r\ndisposed to deposit that matter, and to allow it, by crystallization\r\nor concretion, to assume a solid form.[7] The Neptunists must either\r\nassign a sufficient reason for this great and universal change, or must\r\nexpect to see their system treated as an inartificial accumulation\r\nof hypotheses which assigns opposite virtues to the same subject,\r\nand is alike at variance with nature and with itself; in a word, a\r\nsystem that might pass for the invention of an age, when as yet sound\r\nphilosophy had not alighted on the earth, nor taught man that he is\r\nbut the minister and interpreter of nature, and can neither extend his\r\npower nor his knowledge a hair's-breadth beyond his experience and\r\nobservation of the present order of things.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: NOTE VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Homo naturæ minister, et interpres tantùm facit et\r\nintelligit, quantùm de naturæ ordine re, vel mente, observaverit: nec\r\namplius scit, aut potest.--Nov. Org. lib. i. aph. 1.]\r\n\r\n14. Such are the more obvious, but I think unanswerable objections,\r\nthat may be urged against the aqueous consolidation of the strata.\r\nIt is true, that stony concretions, some of them much indurated, are\r\nformed in the humid way under our eyes. Very particular conditions,\r\nhowever, are required for that purpose, and conditions such as can\r\nhardly have existed at the bottom of the sea. First. The water must\r\ndissolve the substance of which the concretion is to be formed, as it\r\nactually does in the case of calcareous, and in certain circumstances,\r\nin that of siliceous, earth. Secondly. It must be separated from\r\nthat substance, as by evaporation, or by a combination of the matter\r\ndissolved with some third substance, to which it has a greater affinity\r\nthan to water, so as to form with it an insoluble compound. Lastly,\r\nthe water that is deprived of its solution must be carried off, and\r\nmore of that which contains the solution must be supplied, as sometimes\r\nhappens where water runs in a stream, or drops from the roof of a\r\ncavern. The two last conditions are peculiarly inapplicable to the\r\nbottom of the sea, where the state of the surrounding fluid would\r\nneither permit the water that was deprived of its solution from being\r\ndrawn off, nor that which contained the solution from succeeding it.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be observed, that the consolidation of stalactitical\r\nconcretions, that is, the filling up of their pores, is always\r\nimperfect, and is brought about by the repeated action of the fluid\r\nrunning through the porous mass, and continuing to deposit there\r\nsome of the matter it holds in solution. This, which is properly\r\ninfiltration, is incompatible with the nature of a fluid, either\r\nnearly, or altogether quiescent.\r\n\r\n15. In order to judge whether objections of equal weight can be opposed\r\nto the hypothesis of igneous consolidation, we must attend to a very\r\nimportant remark, first made by Dr Hutton, and applied with wonderful\r\nsuccess to explain the most mysterious phenomena of the mineral kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that the effects of fire on bodies vary with the\r\ncircumstances under which it is applied to them, and, therefore, a\r\nconsiderable allowance must be made, if we would compare the operation\r\nof that element when it consolidated the strata, with the results of\r\nour daily experience. The materials of the strata were disposed, as we\r\nhave already seen, loose and unconnected, at the bottom of the sea;\r\nthat is, even on the most moderate estimation, at the depth of several\r\nmiles under its surface. At this depth, and under the pressure of a\r\ncolumn of water of so great a height, the action of heat would differ\r\nmuch from that which we observe here upon the surface; and, though\r\nour experience does not enable us to compute with accuracy the amount\r\nof this difference, it nevertheless points out the direction in which\r\nit must lie, and even marks certain limits to which it would probably\r\nextend.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of an increased pressure on the bodies to which heat is\r\napplied, is to restrain the volatility of those parts which otherwise\r\nwould make their escape, and to force them to endure a more intense\r\naction of heat. At a certain depth under the surface of the sea, the\r\npower even of a very intense heat might therefore be unable to drive\r\noff the oily or bituminous parts from the inflammable matter there\r\ndeposited, so that, when the heat was withdrawn, these principles\r\nmight be found still united to the earthy and carbonic parts, forming\r\na substance very unlike the residuum obtained after combustion under\r\na pressure no greater than the weight of the atmosphere. It is in\r\nlike manner reasonable to believe, that, on the application of heat\r\nto calcareous bodies under great compression, the carbonic gas would\r\nbe forced to remain; the generation of quicklime would be prevented,\r\nand the whole might be softened, or even completely melted; which last\r\neffect, though not directly deducible from any experiment yet made, is\r\nrendered very probable, from the analogy of certain chemical phenomena.\r\n\r\n16. An analogy of this kind, derived from a property of the barytic\r\nearth, was suggested by that excellent chemist and philosopher, the\r\nlate Dr BLACK. The barytic earth, as is well known, has a stronger\r\nattraction for fixed air than common calcareous earth has, so that the\r\ncarbonate of barytes is able to endure a great degree of heat before\r\nits fixed air is expelled. Accordingly, when exposed to an increasing\r\nheat, at a certain temperature, it is brought into fusion, the fixed\r\nair still remaining united to it: if the heat be further increased,\r\nthe air is driven off, the earth loses its fluidity, and appears in\r\na caustic state. Here, it is plain, that the barytic earth, which is\r\ninfusible, or very refractory, _per se_, as well as the calcareous,\r\nowes its fusibility to the presence of the fixed air; and it is\r\ntherefore probable, that the same thing would happen to the calcareous\r\nearth, if by any means the fixed air were prevented from escaping when\r\ngreat heat is applied to it. This escape of the fixed air is exactly\r\nwhat the compression in the subterraneous regions is calculated to\r\nprevent, and therefore we are not to wonder if, among the calcareous\r\nstrata, we find marks of actual fusion having taken place.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: NOTE VII.]\r\n\r\n17. These effects of pressure to resist the decomposition, and augment\r\nthe fusibility of bodies, being once supposed, we shall find little\r\ndifficulty in conceiving the consolidation of the strata by heat, since\r\nthe intervals between the loose materials of which they originally\r\nconsisted may have been closed, either by the softening of those\r\nmaterials, or by the introduction of foreign matter among them, in\r\nthe state of a fluid, or of an elastic vapour. No objection to this\r\nhypothesis can arise from the considerations stated in the preceding\r\ncase; the solvent here employed would want no pores to lodge in after\r\nits work was completed, nor would it find any difficulty in making its\r\nretreat through the densest and most solid substances in the mineral\r\nkingdom. Neither can its incapacity to dissolve the bodies submitted\r\nto its action be alleged. Heat is the most powerful and most general\r\nof all solvents; and, though some bodies, such as the calcareous, are\r\nable to resist its force on the surface of the earth, yet, as has just\r\nbeen shown, it is perfectly agreeable to analogy to suppose, that,\r\nunder great pressure, the carbonic state of the lime being preserved,\r\nthe purest limestone or marble might be softened, or even melted.\r\nWith respect to other substances, less doubt of their fusibility is\r\nentertained; and though, in our experiments, the refractory nature of\r\nsiliceous earth has not been completely subdued, a degree of softness\r\nand an incipient fusion have nevertheless been induced.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, in general, that the same difficulties do not press\r\nagainst the two theories of aqueous and of igneous consolidation; and,\r\nthat the latter employs an agent incomparably more powerful than the\r\nformer, of more general activity, and, what is of infinite importance\r\nin a philosophical theory, vastly more definite in the laws of its\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n18. A more particular examination of the different kinds of fossils\r\nwill confirm this conclusion, and will show, that, wherever they bear\r\nmarks of having been fluid, these marks are such as characterize the\r\nfluidity of fusion, and distinguish it from that which is produced\r\nby solution in a menstruum. Dr Hutton has enumerated many of these\r\ndiscovered in the course of that careful and accurate examination of\r\nfossils, in which he probably never was excelled by any mineralogist.\r\nIt will be sufficient here to point out a few of the most remarkable\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n19. Fossil wood, penetrated by siliceous matter, is a substance well\r\nknown to mineralogists; it is found in great abundance in various\r\nsituations, and frequently in the heart of great bodies of rock. On\r\nexamination, the siliceous matter is often observed to have penetrated\r\nthe wood very unequally, so that the vegetable structure remains in\r\nsome places entire; and in other places is lost in a homogeneous mass\r\nof agate or jasper. Where this happens, it may be remarked, that the\r\nline which separates these two parts is quite sharp and distinct,\r\naltogether different from what must have taken place, had the flinty\r\nmatter been introduced into the body of the wood, by any fluid in which\r\nit was dissolved, as it would then have pervaded the whole, if not\r\nuniformly, yet with a regular gradation. In those specimens of fossil\r\nwood that are partly penetrated by agate, and partly not penetrated\r\nat all, the same sharpness of termination may be remarked, and is an\r\nappearance highly characteristic of the fluidity produced by fusion.\r\n\r\n20. The round nodules of flint that are found in chalk, quite insulated\r\nand separate from one another, afford an argument of the same kind;\r\nsince the flinty matter, if it had been carried into the chalk by any\r\nsolvent, must have been deposited with a certain degree of uniformity,\r\nand would not now appear collected into separate masses, without any\r\ntrace of its existence in the intermediate parts. On the other hand, if\r\nwe conceive the melted flint to have been forcibly injected among the\r\nchalk, and to have penetrated it, somewhat as mercury may, by pressure,\r\nbe made to penetrate through the pores of wood, it might, on cooling,\r\nexhibit the same appearances that the chalk-beds of England do actually\r\npresent us with.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous pudding-stone is an instance closely connected with the\r\ntwo last; in it we find both the pebbles, and the cement which unites\r\nthem, consisting of flint equally hard and consolidated; and this\r\ncircumstance, for which it is impossible to account by infiltration, or\r\nthe insinuation of an aqueous solvent, is perfectly consistent with the\r\nsupposition, that a stream of melted flint has been forcibly injected\r\namong a mass of loose gravel.\r\n\r\n21. The common grit, or sandstone, though it certainly gives no\r\nindication of having possessed fluidity, is strongly expressive of the\r\neffects of heat. It is so, especially in those instances where the\r\nparticles of quartzy sand, of which it is composed, are firmly and\r\nclosely united, without the help of any cementing substance whatsoever.\r\nThis appearance, which is very common, seems to be quite inconsistent\r\nwith every idea of consolidation, except an incipient fusion, which,\r\nwith the assistance of a suitable compression, has enabled the\r\nparticles of quartz to unite into stone.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed been asserted, that the mere apposition of stony\r\nparticles, so as to permit their corpuscular attraction to take place,\r\nwas sufficient to form them into stone. To this Dr Hutton has very well\r\nreplied, that, admitting the possibility of a hard and firm body being\r\nproduced in this way of which, however, we have no proof, the close\r\nand compact texture, the perfect consolidation of the stones we are\r\nnow speaking of, would still remain to be explained, and of this it is\r\nevident that the mere apposition of particles, and the force of their\r\nmutual attraction, can afford no solution.\r\n\r\n22. These proofs that the strata must have endured the action of\r\nintense heat, though immediately deduced from those of the siliceous\r\ngenus only, extend in reality to all the strata, of every kind, with\r\nwhich they are found alternated. It is impossible that heat, of the\r\nintensity here supposed, can have acted on a particular stratum, and\r\nnot on those that are contiguous to it; and, as there are no strata of\r\nany kind with which the quartzy and siliceous are not intermixed, so\r\nthere are none of which the igneous consolidation is not thus rendered\r\nprobable. We need rest nothing, however, on this argument, as the\r\nfossils of every genus may be shown to speak distinctly for themselves.\r\n\r\n23. Those of the calcareous genus do so perhaps more sparingly than\r\nthe rest; yet even among them there are many facts, that, though taken\r\nunconnected with all others, are sufficient to establish the action of\r\nsubterraneous fire. Such, for example, are the calcareous breccias,\r\ncomposed of fragments of marble or limestone, and not only adapted to\r\neach other's shape, but indented into one another, in a manner not\r\na little resembling the _sutures_ of the human _cranium_. From such\r\ninstances, it is impossible not to infer the softness of the calcareous\r\nfragments when they were consolidated into one mass. Now, this softness\r\ncould be induced only by heat; for it must be acknowledged, that the\r\naction of any other solvent is quite inadequate to the softening of\r\nlarge fragments of stone, without dissolving them altogether.\r\n\r\n24. In many other instances it appears certain, that the stones\r\nof the calcareous genus have been reduced by heat into a state of\r\nfluidity much more perfect. Thus, the saline or finer kinds of marble,\r\nand many others that have a structure highly crystallized, must\r\nhave been softened to a degree little short of fusion, before this\r\ncrystallization could take place. Even the petrifactions which abound\r\nso much in limestones tend to establish the same fact; for they possess\r\na sparry structure, and must have acquired that structure in their\r\ntransition from a fluid to a solid state.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: NOTE VIII.]\r\n\r\n25. In accounting, by the operation of heat, for these appearances\r\nof fluidity, Dr Hutton has proceeded on the principle already laid\r\ndown, as conformable to analogy, that calcareous earth, under great\r\ncompression, may have its fixed air retained in it, notwithstanding the\r\naction of intense heat, and may, by that means, be reduced into fusion,\r\nor into a state approaching to it. In all this I do not think that he\r\nhas departed from the strictest rules of philosophical investigation.\r\nThe facts just stated prove, that limestone was once soft, its\r\nfragments retaining at the same time their peculiar form, an effect to\r\nwhich we know of none similar but those of fire; and, therefore, though\r\nwe could not conjecture how heat might be applied to limestone so as\r\nto melt it, instead of reducing it to a calx, we should, nevertheless,\r\nhave been forced to suppose, that this had actually taken place in the\r\nbowels of the earth; and was a fact which, though we were not able to\r\nexplain it, we were not entitled to deny. The principle just mentioned\r\nrelieves us therefore from a difficulty, that would have embarrassed,\r\nbut could not have overturned, this theory of the earth.\r\n\r\n26. From the arguments which the argillaceous strata afford for the\r\nigneous consolidation of fossils, I shall select one on which Dr Hutton\r\nused to lay considerable stress, and which some of the adversaries of\r\nhis system have endeavoured to refute. This argument is founded on the\r\nstructure of certain ironstones called _septaria_, often met with among\r\nthe argillaceous schistus, particularly in the vicinity of coal. These\r\nstones are usually of a lenticular or spheroidal form, and are divided\r\nin their interior into distinct _septa_, by veins of calcareous spar,\r\nof which one set are circular and concentric, the other rectilineal;\r\ndiverging from the centre of the former, and diminishing in size as\r\nthey recede from it. Now, what is chiefly to be remarked is, that\r\nthese veins terminate before they reach the surface of the stone; so\r\nthat the matter with which they are filled cannot have been introduced\r\nfrom without by infiltration, or in any other way whatsoever. The only\r\nother supposition, therefore, that is left for explaining the singular\r\nstructure of this fossil, is, that the whole mass was originally\r\nfluid, and that, in cooling, the calcareous part separated from the\r\nrest, and afterwards crystallized.\r\n\r\n27. It has been urged against this theory of the septaria, that these\r\nstones are sometimes found with the calcareous veins extending all\r\nthe way to the circumference, and of course communicating with the\r\noutside. But it must be observed, that this fact does not affect the\r\nargument drawn from specimens in which no such communication takes\r\nplace. It is at best only an ambiguous instance, that may be explained\r\nby two opposite theories, and may be reconciled either to the notion\r\nof igneous or of aqueous consolidation: but if there is a single close\r\nseptarium in nature, it can, of course, be explained only by one of\r\nthese theories, and the other must, of necessity, be rejected. Besides,\r\nit is plain, that a close septarium can never have been open, though an\r\nopen septarium may very well have been close; and indeed, as this stone\r\nis, in certain circumstances, subject to perpetual exfoliation, it\r\nwould be wonderful if no one was ever found with the calcareous veins\r\nreaching to the surface. With regard to the light, therefore, that they\r\ngive into their own history, these two kinds of septaria are by no\r\nmeans on an equal footing; and this may serve to show, how necessary\r\nit is, in all inductive reasoning, and particularly in a subject so\r\ncomplex as geology, to separate with care such phenomena as admit of\r\ntwo solutions, from such as admit only of one.\r\n\r\n28. The bituminous strata come next to be considered; and they are of\r\ngreat consequence in the present argument, because their dissimilarity\r\nin so many particulars to all other mineral substances, renders them\r\nwhat Lord Bacon calls an _instantia singularis_, having the first\r\nrank among facts subservient to inductive investigation. But though\r\nunlike in substance to other fossils, and composed, as has been shown,\r\nof materials that belonged not originally to the mineral kingdom,\r\nthey agree in many material circumstances with the strata already\r\nenumerated. Their beds are disposed in the same manner, and are\r\nalternated indiscriminately with those of all the secondary rocks,\r\nand, being formed in the same region, must have been subject to the\r\nsame accidents, and have endured the operation of the same causes.\r\nThey are traversed too like the other strata, by veins of the metals,\r\nof spars, of basaltes, and of other substances; and, whatever argument\r\nmay hereafter be derived from this to prove the action of fire on the\r\nstrata so traversed, is as much applicable to coal as to any other\r\nmineral. The coal strata also contain pyrites in great abundance, a\r\nsubstance that is perhaps, more than any other, the decided progeny of\r\nfire. This compound of metal and sulphur, which is found in mineral\r\nbodies of every kind, I believe, without any exception, is destroyed\r\nby the contact of moisture, and resolved into a vitriolic salt. At\r\nthe same time it is found in the strata, not traversing them in\r\nveins, which may be supposed of more recent formation than the strata\r\nthemselves; but existing in the heart of the most solid rocks, often\r\nnicely crystallized, and completely inclosed, on all sides, without the\r\nmost minute vacuity. The pyrites must have been present, therefore,\r\nwhen the strata were consolidated, and it is inconceivable, if their\r\nconsolidation was brought about in the wet way, that a substance\r\nshould be so generally found in them, the very existence of which is\r\nincompatible with humidity. This argument for the igneous origin of the\r\nstrata is applicable to them all, but especially to those of coal, as\r\nabounding with pyrites more than any other.\r\n\r\n29. The difficulty that here naturally present itself, viz. how\r\nvegetable matter, such as coal is supposed to have been, could be\r\nexposed to the action of intense heat, without being deprived of its\r\ninflammable part, is obviated by the principle formerly explained\r\nconcerning the effects of compression. The weight incumbent on\r\nthe strata of coal, when they were exposed to the intense heat of\r\nthe mineral regions, may have been such as to retain the oily and\r\nbituminous, as well as sulphureous parts, though the whole was reduced\r\nalmost to fusion; and thus, on cooling, the sulphur uniting with iron\r\nmight crystallize, and assume the form of pyrites.\r\n\r\n30. The compression, however, has not in every instance preserved the\r\nbituminous, in union with the carbonic part of coal; and hence a mark\r\nof the operation of fire quite peculiar to this fossil, and found in\r\nthose infusible kinds of it which contain no bitumen, and burn without\r\nflame. These resemble, some of them very precisely, and all them in a\r\ngreat degree, the products obtained by the distillation of the common\r\nbituminous coal that is, they consist of charcoal, united to an earthy\r\nbasis in different proportions. It is natural therefore to conclude,\r\nthat this substance was prepared in the mineral regions by the action\r\nof heat, which, in some instances, has driven off the inflammable part\r\nof the coal. That the heat should, in some cases, have done so, is not\r\ninconsistent with the general effect attributed to compression. The\r\nconditions necessary for retaining the more volatile parts, may not\r\nhave been present every where in the same degree, so that the latter,\r\nthough they could not escape, may have been forced from one part of a\r\nstratum, or body of strata, to another.\r\n\r\n31. In confirmation of this it must be observed, that, as the fixed\r\npart of coal is thus found in the bowels of the earth, separate from\r\nthe volatile or bituminous, so, in the neighbourhood of coal strata,\r\nthe latter is sometimes found without any mixture of the former. The\r\nfountains of naphtha and petroleum are well known; and Dr Hutton\r\nhas described a stratum of limestone, lying in the centre of a coal\r\ncountry, which is pervaded and tinged by bituminous matter, through\r\nits whole mass, and has, at the same time, many close cavities in\r\nthe heart of it, lined with calcareous spar, and containing fossil\r\npitch, sometimes in large pieces, sometimes in hemispherical drops,\r\nscattered over the surface of the cavities. This combination could\r\nonly be effected by a part of the inflammable matter of the beds of\r\ncoal underneath, being driven off by heat, and made to penetrate the\r\nlimestone, while it was yet soft and pervious to heated vapours.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: NOTE IX.]\r\n\r\n32. Hitherto we have enumerated those fossils that are either not at\r\nall, or very sparingly soluble in water. There are, however, saline\r\nbodies among the mineral strata, such for instance as rock-salt, which\r\nare readily dissolved in water; and it yet remains to examine by what\r\ncause their consolidation has been effected.\r\n\r\nHere the theorists who consider water as the sole agent in the\r\nmineralization of fossils, are indeed delivered from one difficulty,\r\nbut it is only that they may be harder pressed on by another. It\r\ncannot now be said, that the menstruum which they employ is incapable\r\nof dissolving the substances exposed to its action, as in the case of\r\nmetallic or stony bodies; but it may very well be asked, how the water\r\ncame to deposit the salts which it held in solution, and to deposit\r\nthem so copiously as it has done in many places, without any vestige\r\nof similar deposition in the places immediately contiguous. If they\r\nrefuse to call to their assistance any other than their favourite\r\nelement, they will not find it easy to answer this question, and must\r\nfeel the embarrassment of a system, subject to two difficulties, so\r\nnicely, but so unhappily adjusted, that one of them is always prepared\r\nto act whenever the other is removed. If, on the other hand, they will\r\nadmit the operation of subterraneous heat, it appears possible, that\r\nthe local application of such heat may have driven the water, in\r\nvapour, from one place to another, and by such action often repeated in\r\nthe same spot, may have produced those great accumulations of saline\r\nmatter, that are actually found in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n33. But granting that, either in the way just pointed out, or in some\r\nother that is unknown, the salt and the water have been separated,\r\nsome further action of heat seems requisite, before a compact, and\r\nhighly indurated body, like rock-salt, could be produced. The mere\r\nprecipitation of the salt, would, as Dr Hutton has observed, form only\r\nan assemblage of loose crystals at the bottom of the sea, without\r\nsolidity or cohesion: and to convert such a mass into a firm and solid\r\nrock, would require the application of such heat as was able to reduce\r\nit into fusion. The consolidation of rock-salt, therefore, however its\r\nseparation from the water is accounted for, cannot be explained but on\r\nthe hypothesis of subterraneous heat.\r\n\r\n34. Some other phenomena that have been observed in salt mines, come\r\nin support of the same conclusion. The salt rock of Cheshire, which\r\nlies in thick beds, interposed between strata of an argillaceous or\r\nmarly stone, and is itself mixed with a considerable portion of the\r\nsame earth, exhibits a very great peculiarity in its structure. Though\r\nit forms a mass extremely compact, the salt is found to be arranged\r\nin round masses of five or six feet in diameter, not truly spherical,\r\nbut each compressed by those that surround it, so as to have the shape\r\nof an irregular polyhedron. These are formed of concentric coats,\r\ndistinguishable from one another by their colour, that is, probably\r\nby the greater or less quantity of earth which they contain, so that\r\nthe roof of the mine, as it exhibits a horizontal section of them,\r\nis divided into polygonal figures, each with a multitude of polygons\r\nwithin it, having altogether no inconsiderable resemblance to a\r\n_mosaic_ pavement. In the triangular spaces without the polygons, the\r\nsalt is in coats parallel to the sides of the polygons.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which gave rise to this singular structure we should\r\nin vain endeavour to define; yet some general conclusions concerning\r\nthem seem to be within our reach. It is clear that the whole mass of\r\nsalt was fluid at once, and that the forces, whatever they were, which\r\ngave solidity to it, and produced the new arrangement of its particles,\r\nwere all in action at the same time. The uniformity of the coated\r\nstructure is a proof of this, and, above all, the compression of the\r\npolyhedra, which is always mutual, the flat side of one being turned to\r\nthe flat side of another, and never an angle to an angle, nor an angle\r\nto a side. The coats formed as it were round so many different centres\r\nof attraction, is also an appearance quite inconsistent with the notion\r\nof deposition; both these, however, are compatible with the notion of\r\nsolidity acquired by the refrigeration of a fluid, where the whole\r\nmass is acted on at the same time, and where no solvent remains to be\r\ndisposed of after the induration of the rest.\r\n\r\n35. Another species of fossil salt exhibits appearances equally\r\nfavourable to the theory of igneous consolidation. This is the Trona of\r\nAfrica, which is no other than soda, or mineral alkali, in a particular\r\nstate. The specimen of this fossil in Dr Black's, now Dr Hope's,\r\ncollection, is of a sparry and radiated structure, and is evidently\r\npart of the contents of a vein, having a stony crust adhering to it,\r\non one side, with its own sparry structure complete, on the opposite.\r\nIt contains but about one sixth of the water of crystallization\r\nessential to this salt when obtained in the humid way; and, what is\r\nparticularly to be remarked, it does not lose this water, nor become\r\ncovered with a powder, like the common alkali, by simple exposure to\r\nthe air. It is evident, therefore, that this fossil does not originate\r\nfrom mere precipitation; and when we add, that in its sparry structure\r\nit contains evident marks of having once been fluid, we have little\r\nreason to entertain much doubt concerning the principle of its\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the testimony given to the operation of fire, or heat,\r\nas the consolidating power of the mineral kingdom, is not confined\r\nto a few fossils, but is general over all the strata. How far the\r\nunstratified fossils agree in supporting the same conclusion, will be\r\nafterwards examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   3. _Position of the Strata._[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 120.]\r\n\r\n36. We have seen of what materials the strata are composed, and by\r\nwhat power they have been consolidated; we are next to inquire, from\r\nwhat cause it proceeds, that they are now so far removed from the\r\nregion which they originally occupied, and wherefore, from being all\r\ncovered by the ocean, they are at present raised in many places fifteen\r\nthousand feet above its surface. Whether this great change of relative\r\nplace can be best accounted for by the depression of the sea, or the\r\nelevation of the strata themselves, remains to be considered.\r\n\r\nOf these two suppositions, the former, at first sight, seems\r\nundoubtedly the most probable, and we feel less reluctance to suppose,\r\nthat a fluid, so unstable as the ocean, has undergone the great\r\nrevolution here referred to, than that the solid foundations of the\r\nland have moved a single fathom from their place. This, however, is a\r\nmere illusion. Such a depression of the level of the sea as is here\r\nsupposed, could not happen without a change proportionally great in the\r\nsolid part of the globe; and, though admitted as true, will be found\r\nvery inadequate to explain the present condition of the strata.\r\n\r\n37. Supposing the appearances which clearly indicate submersion under\r\nwater to reach no higher than ten thousand feet above the present level\r\nof the sea, and of course the surface of the sea to have been formerly\r\nhigher by that quantity than it is now; it necessarily follows, that\r\na bulk of water has disappeared, equal to more than a seven hundredth\r\npart of the whole magnitude of the globe.[13] The existence of empty\r\ncaverns of extent sufficient to contain this vast body of water, and of\r\nsuch a convulsion as to lay them open, and give room to the retreat of\r\nthe sea, are suppositions which a philosopher could only be justified\r\nin admitting, if they promised to furnish a very complete explanation\r\nof appearances. But this justification is entirely wanting in the\r\npresent case; for the retreat of the ocean to a lower level, furnishes\r\na very partial and imperfect explanation of the phenomena of geology.\r\nIt will not explain the numberless remains of ancient continents that\r\nare involved, as we have seen, in the present, unless it be supposed\r\nthat the ancient ocean, though it rose to so great a height, had\r\nnevertheless its shores, and was the boundary of land still higher than\r\nitself. And, as to that which is now more immediately the object of\r\ninquiry, the position of the strata, though the above hypothesis would\r\naccount in some sort for the change of their place, relatively to the\r\nlevel of the sea; yet, if it shall be proved, that the strata have\r\nchanged their place relatively to each other, and relatively to the\r\nplane of the horizon, so as to have had an angular motion impressed on\r\nthem, it is evident that, for these facts, the retreat of the sea does\r\nnot afford even the shadow of a theory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: NOTE X.]\r\n\r\n38. Now, it is certain, that many of the strata have been moved\r\nangularly, because that, in their original position, they must have\r\nbeen all nearly horizontal. Loose materials, such as sand and gravel\r\nsubsiding at the bottom of the sea, and having their interstices filled\r\nwith water, possess a kind of fluidity: they are disposed to yield\r\non the side opposite to that where the pressure is greatest, and are\r\ntherefore, in some degree, subject to the laws of hydrostatics. On\r\nthis account they will arrange themselves in horizontal layers; and\r\nthe vibrations of the incumbent fluid, by impressing slight motion\r\nbackward, and forward, on the materials of these layers, will very much\r\nassist the accuracy of their level.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, meant to deny, that the form of the bottom might\r\ninfluence, in a certain degree, the stratification of the substances\r\ndeposited on it. The figure of the lower beds deposited on an uneven\r\nsurface, would necessarily be affected by two causes; the inclination\r\nof that surface, on the one hand, and the tendency to horizontality,\r\non the other; but, as the former cause would grow less powerful as the\r\ndistance from the bottom increased, the latter cause would finally\r\nprevail, so that the upper beds would approach to horizontally, and the\r\nlower would neither be exactly parallel to them, nor to one another.\r\nWhenever, therefore, we meet with rocks, disposed in layers quite\r\nparallel to one another, we may rest assured, that the inequalities of\r\nthe bottom have had no effect, and that no cause has interrupted the\r\nstatical tendency above explained.\r\n\r\nNow, rocks having their layers exactly parallel, are very common, and\r\nprove their original horizontally to have been more precise than we\r\ncould venture to conclude from analogy alone. In beds of sandstone,\r\nfor instance, nothing is more frequent than to see the thin layers of\r\nsand, separated from one another by layers still finer of coaly, or\r\nmicaceous matter, that are almost exactly parallel, and continue so to\r\na great extent without any sensible deviation. These planes can have\r\nacquired their parallelism only in consequence of the property of water\r\njust stated, by which it renders the surfaces of the layers, which it\r\ndeposits, parallel to its own surface, and therefore parallel to one\r\nanother. Though such strata, therefore, may not now be horizontal, they\r\nmust have been so originally; otherwise it is impossible to discover\r\nany cause for their parallelism, or any rule by which it can have been\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n39. This argument for the original horizontality of the strata,\r\nis applicable to those that are now farthest removed from that\r\nposition. Among such, for instance, as are highly inclined, or even\r\nquite vertical, and among those that are bent and incurvated in the\r\nmost fantastical manner, as happens more especially in the primary\r\nschisti, we observe, through all their sinuosities and inflections,\r\nan equality of thickness and of distance among their component\r\nlaminæ. This equality could only be produced by those laminæ having\r\nbeen originally spread out on a flat and level surface, from which\r\nsituation, therefore, they must afterwards have been lifted up by the\r\naction of some powerful cause, and must have suffered this disturbance\r\nwhile they were yet in a certain degree flexible and ductile. Though\r\nthe primary direction of the force which thus elevated them must have\r\nbeen from below upwards, yet it has been so combined with the gravity\r\nand resistance of the mass to which it was applied, as to create a\r\nlateral and oblique thrust, and to produce those contortions of the\r\nstrata, which, when on the great scale, are among the most striking and\r\ninstructive phenomena of geology.\r\n\r\n40. Great additional force is given to this argument, in many cases, by\r\nthe nature of the materials of which the stratified rocks are composed.\r\nThe beds of breccia and pudding-stone, for instance, are often in\r\nplanes almost vertical, and, at the same time, contain gravel-stones,\r\nand other fragments of rock, of such a size and weight, that they\r\ncould not remain in their present position an instant, if the cement\r\nwhich unites them were to become soft; and therefore they certainly\r\nhad not that position at the time when this cement was actually soft.\r\nThis remark has been made by mineralogists who were not led to it by\r\nany system. The judicious and indefatigable observer of the Alps,\r\ndescribing the pudding-stone of Valorsine, near the sources of the\r\nArve, tells us, that he was astonished to find it in beds almost\r\nvertical, a situation in which it could not possibly have been formed.\r\n\"That particles,\" he adds, \"of extreme tenuity, suspended in a fluid,\r\nmight become agglutinated, and form vertical beds, is a thing that\r\nmay be conceived; but that pieces of stone, of several pounds weight,\r\nshould have rested on the side of a perpendicular wall, till they were\r\nenveloped in a stony cement, and united into one mass, is a supposition\r\nimpossible and absurd. It should be considered, therefore, as a thing\r\ndemonstrated, that this pudding-stone was formed in a horizontal\r\nposition, or one nearly such, and elevated after its induration. We\r\nknow not,\" he continues, \"the force by which this elevation has been\r\neffected; but it is an important step among the prodigious number of\r\nvertical beds that are to be met with in the Alps, to have found some\r\nthat must certainly have been formed in a horizontal situation.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. ii § 690.]\r\n\r\n41. Nothing can be more sound and conclusive than this reasoning; and\r\nhad the ingenious author pursued it more systematically, it must have\r\nled him to a theory of mountains very little different from that which\r\nwe are now endeavouring to explain. If some of the vertical strata are\r\nproved to have been formed horizontally, there can be no reason for\r\nnot extending the same conclusion to them all, even if we had not the\r\nsupport of the argument from the parallelism of the layers, which has\r\nbeen already stated.\r\n\r\n42. The highly inclined position, and the manifold inflections of the\r\nstrata, are not the only proofs of the disturbance that they have\r\nsuffered, and of the violence with which they have been forced up from\r\ntheir original place. Those interruptions of their continuity which\r\nare observed, both at the surface and under it, are evidences of the\r\nsame fact. It is plain, that if they remained now in the situation\r\nin which they were at first deposited, they would never appear to\r\nbe suddenly broken off. No stratum would terminate abruptly; but,\r\nhowever its nature and properties might change, it would constitute\r\nan entire and continued rock, at least where the effects of waste and\r\n_detritus_ had not produced a separation. This, however, is very far\r\nfrom being the actual condition of stratified bodies. Those that are\r\nmuch inclined, or that make considerable angles with the horizontal\r\nplane, must terminate abruptly where they come up to the surface. Their\r\ndoing so is a necessary consequence of their position, and furnishes no\r\nargument, it may be said, for their having been disturbed, different\r\nfrom that which has been already deduced from their inclination. There\r\nare, however, instances of a breach of continuity in the strata, under\r\nthe surface, that afford a proof of the violence with which they have\r\nbeen displaced, different from any hitherto mentioned. Of this nature\r\nare the _slips_ or _shifts_, that so often perplex the miner in his\r\nsubterraneous journey, and which change at once all those lines and\r\nbearings that had hitherto directed his course. When his mine reaches\r\na certain plane, which is sometimes perpendicular, sometimes oblique\r\nto the horizon, he finds the beds of rock broken asunder, those on\r\nthe one side of the plane having changed their place, by sliding in\r\na particular direction along the face of the others. In this motion\r\nthey have sometimes preserved their parallelism, that is, the strata\r\non one side of the _slip_ continue parallel to those on the other; in\r\nother cases, the strata on each side become inclined to one another,\r\nthough their identity is still to be recognized by their possessing\r\nthe same thickness, and the same internal characters. These _shifts_\r\nare often of great extent, and must be measured by the quantity of\r\nthe rock moved, taken in conjunction with the distance to which it\r\nhas been carried. In some instances, a vein is formed at the plane of\r\nthe shift or slip, filled with materials of the kinds which will be\r\nhereafter mentioned; in other instances, the opposite sides of the rock\r\nremain contiguous, or have the interval between them filled with soft\r\nand unconsolidated earth. All these are the undeniable effects of some\r\ngreat convulsion, which has shaken the very foundations of the earth;\r\nbut which, far from being a disorder in nature, is part of a regular\r\nsystem, essential to the constitution and economy of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe production of the appearances now described, belongs, without\r\ndoubt, to different periods of time; and, where slips intersect one\r\nanother, we can often distinguish the less from the more ancient They\r\nare all, however, of a date posterior to that at which the waving and\r\nundulated forms of the strata were acquired, as they do not carry with\r\nthem any marks of the softness of the rock, but many of its complete\r\ninduration.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon which is thus exemplified on a great scale in\r\nthe bowels of the earth, is often most beautifully exhibited in\r\nsingle specimens of stone, and is accompanied with this remarkable\r\ncircumstance, that the _integrity_ of the stone is not destroyed by the\r\nshifts, whatever wounds had been made in it being healed, and the parts\r\nfirmly reunited to one another.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: NOTE XI.]\r\n\r\n43. Though such marks of violence as have been now enumerated are\r\ncommon in some degree to all the strata, they abound most among the\r\nprimary, and point out these as the part of our globe which has been\r\nexposed to the greatest vicissitudes. At their junction with the\r\nsecondary, or where they emerge, as it were, from under the latter,\r\nphenomena occur, which mark some of those vicissitudes with astonishing\r\nprecision; phenomena of which the nature was first accurately explored,\r\nand the consequences fully deduced, by the geologist whose system I am\r\nendeavouring to explain. He observed, in several instances, that where\r\nthe primary schistus rises in beds almost vertical, it is covered by\r\nhorizontal layers of secondary sandstone, which last are penetrated by\r\nthe irregular tops of the schistus, and also involve fragments of that\r\nrock, some angular, others round and smooth, as if worn by attrition.\r\nFrom this he concluded, that the primary strata, after being formed at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, in planes nearly horizontal, were raised, so as\r\nto become almost vertical, while they were yet covered by the ocean,\r\nand before the secondary strata had begun to be deposited on them. He\r\nalso argued, that, as the fragments of the primary rock, included in\r\nthe secondary, are many of them rounded and worn, the deposition of\r\nthe latter must have been separated from the elevation of the former\r\nby such an interval of time, as gave room for the action of waste and\r\ndecay, allowing those fragments first to be detached, and afterwards\r\nwrought into a round figure.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: NOTE XII.]\r\n\r\n44. Indeed, the interposition of a breccia between the primary and\r\nsecondary strata, in which the fragments, whether round or angular,\r\nare always of the primary rock, is a fact so general, and the quantity\r\nof this breccia is often so great, that it leads to a conclusion more\r\nparadoxical than any of the preceding, but from which, nevertheless,\r\nit seems very difficult to withhold assent. Round gravel, when in\r\ngreat abundance, agreeably to a remark already made, must necessarily\r\nbe considered as a production peculiar to the beds of rivers, or\r\nthe shores of continents, and as hardly ever formed at great depths\r\nunder the surface of the sea. It should seem, then, that the primary\r\nschistus, after attaining its erect position, had been raised up to\r\nthe surface, where this gravel was formed; and from thence had been\r\nlet down again to the depths of the ocean, where the secondary strata\r\nwere deposited on it. Such alternate elevations and depressions of the\r\nbottom of the sea, however extraordinary they may seem, will appear to\r\nmake a part of the system of the mineral kingdom, from other phenomena\r\nhereafter to be described.\r\n\r\n45. On the whole, therefore, by comparing the actual position of the\r\nstrata, their erectness, their curvature, the interruptions of their\r\ncontinuity, and the transverse stratification of the secondary in\r\nrespect of the primary, with the regular and level situation which\r\nthe same strata must have originally possessed, we have a complete\r\ndemonstration of their having been disturbed, torn asunder, and moved\r\nangularly, by a force that has, in general, been directed from below\r\nupwards. In establishing this conclusion, we have reasoned more from\r\nthe facts which relate to the _angular elevation_ of the strata,\r\nthan from those which relate to their _absolute elevation_, or their\r\ntranslation to a greater distance from the centre of the earth. This\r\nhas been done, because the appearances, which respect the absolute\r\nlifting up of the strata are more ambiguous than those, which respect\r\nthe change of their angular position. The former might be accounted\r\nfor, could they be separated from the latter, in two ways, viz. either\r\nby the retreat of the sea, or the raising up of the land; but the\r\nlatter can be explained only in one way, and force us of necessity to\r\nacknowledge the existence of an expanding power, which has acted on the\r\nstrata with incredible energy, and has been directed from the centre\r\ntoward the circumference.\r\n\r\n46. When we are assured of the existence of such a power as this in the\r\nmineral regions, we should argue with singular inconsistency, if we did\r\nnot ascribe to it all the other appearances of motion in those regions,\r\nwhich it is adequate to produce. If nature in her subterraneous abodes\r\nis provided with a force that could burst asunder the massy pavement\r\nof the globe, and place the fragments upright upon their edges, could\r\nshe not, by the same effort, raise them from the greatest depths of the\r\nsea, to the highest elevation of the land? The cause that is adequate\r\nto one of these effects is adequate to them both together; for it is a\r\nprinciple well known in mechanical philosophy, that the force which\r\nproduces a parallel motion, may, according to the way in which it is\r\napplied, produce also an angular motion, without any diminution of the\r\nformer effect. It would, therefore, be extremely unphilosophical to\r\nsuppose, that any other cause has changed the relative level of the\r\nstrata, and the surface of the sea, than that which has, in so many\r\ncases, raised the strata from a horizontal to a highly inclined, or\r\neven vertical situation: it would be to introduce the action of more\r\ncauses than the phenomena require, and to forget, that nature, whose\r\noperations we are endeavouring to trace, combines the possession of\r\ninfinite resources with the most economical application of them.\r\n\r\n47. From all, therefore, that relates to the position of the strata, I\r\nthink I am justified in affirming, that their disturbance and removal\r\nfrom the place of their original formation, by a force directed\r\nfrom below upwards, is a fact in the natural history of the earth,\r\nas perfectly ascertained as any thing which is not the subject of\r\nimmediate observation. As to the power by which this great effect has\r\nbeen produced, we cannot expect to decide with equal evidence, but must\r\nbe contented to pass from what is certain to what is probable. We may,\r\nthen, remark, that of the forces in nature to which our experience\r\ndoes in any degree extend, none seems so capable of the effect we\r\nwould ascribe to it, as the expansive power of heat; a power to which\r\nno limits can be set, and one, which, on grounds quite independent of\r\nthe elevation of the strata, has been already concluded to act with\r\ngreat energy in the subterraneous regions. We have, indeed, no other\r\nalternative, but either to adopt this explanation, or to ascribe the\r\nfacts in question to some secret and unknown cause, though we are\r\nignorant of its nature, and have no evidence of its existence.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore to suppose, that the power of the same subterraneous\r\nheat, which consolidated and mineralized the strata at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, has since raised them up to the height at which they are now\r\nplaced, and has given them the various inclinations to the horizon\r\nwhich they are found actually to possess.\r\n\r\n48. The probability of this hypothesis will appear greatly increased,\r\nwhen it is considered, that, besides those now enumerated, there are\r\nother indications of movement among the bodies of the mineral kingdom,\r\nwhere effects of heat more characteristic than simple expansion are\r\nclearly to be discovered. Thus, on examining the marks of disorder\r\nand movement which are found among the strata, it cannot fail to be\r\nobserved, that notwithstanding the fracture and dislocation, of which\r\nthey afford so many examples, there are few empty spaces to be met\r\nwith among them, as far as our observation extends. The breaches and\r\nseparations are numerous, and distinct; but they are, for the most\r\npart, completely filled up with minerals of a kind quite different\r\nfrom the rock on each side of them, and remarkable for containing\r\nno vestiges of stratification. We are thus led to consider the\r\nunstratified minerals, the second of the divisions into which the whole\r\nmineral kingdom, viewed geologically, ought to be distinguished. These\r\nminerals are immediately connected with the disturbance of the strata,\r\nand appear, in many instances, to have been the instruments of their\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II.\r\n\r\n           OF THE PHENOMENA PECULIAR TO UNSTRATIFIED BODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1. _Metallic Veins._\r\n\r\n49. THE unstratified minerals exist either in veins, intersecting the\r\nstratified, or in masses surrounded by them. Veins are of various\r\nkinds, and may in general be defined, separations in the continuity of\r\na rock, of a determinate width, but extending indefinitely in length\r\nand depth, and filled with mineral substances, different from the rock\r\nitself. The mineral veins, strictly so called, are those filled with\r\ncrystallized substances, and containing the metallic ores.\r\n\r\nThat these veins are of a formation subsequent to the hardening and\r\nconsolidation of the strata which they traverse, is too obvious to\r\nrequire any proof; and it is no less clear, from the crystallized\r\nand sparry structure of the substances contained in them, that these\r\nsubstances must have concreted from a fluid state. Now, that this\r\nfluidity was simple, like that of fusion by heat, and not compound,\r\nlike that of solution in a menstruum, is inferred from many phenomena.\r\nIt is inferred from the acknowledged insolubility of the substances\r\nthat fill the veins, in any one menstruum whatsoever; from the total\r\ndisappearance of the solvent, if there was any; from the complete\r\nfilling up of the vein by the substances which that solvent had\r\ndeposited; from the entire absence of all the appearances of horizontal\r\nor gradual deposition; and, lastly, from the existence of close\r\ncavities, lined with crystals, and admitting no egress to any thing but\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n50. To the same effect may be mentioned those groups of crystals\r\ncomposed of substances the most different, that are united in the same\r\nspecimen, all intersecting and mutually impressing one another. These\r\nadmit of being explained, on the supposition that they were originally\r\nin fusion, and became solid by the loss of heat; a cause that acted\r\non them all alike, and alike impelled them to crystallize: But the\r\nappearances of simultaneous crystallization seem incompatible with the\r\nnature of deposition from a solvent, where, with respect 16 different\r\nsubstances, the effects must take place slowly, and in succession.\r\n\r\n51. The metals contained in the veins which we are now treating of,\r\nappear very commonly in the form of an ore, mineralized by sulphur.\r\nTheir union with this latter substance can be produced, as we know, by\r\nheat, but hardly by the way of solution in a menstruum, and certainly\r\nnot at all, if that menstruum is nothing else than water. The metals,\r\ntherefore, when mineralized by sulphur, give no countenance to the\r\nhypothesis of aqueous solution; and still less do they give any when\r\nthey are found native, as it is called, that is, malleable, pure\r\nand uncombined with any other substance. The great masses of native\r\niron found in Siberia and South America are well known; and nothing\r\ncertainly can less resemble the products of a chemical precipitation.\r\nGold, however, the most perfect of the metals, is found native most\r\nfrequently; the others more rarely, in proportion nearly to the\r\nfacility of their combination with sulphur. Of all such specimens it\r\nmay be safely affirmed, that if they have ever been fluid, or even\r\nsoft, they must have been so by the action of heat; for, to suppose\r\nthat a metal has been precipitated, pure and uncombined from any\r\nmenstruum, is to trespass against all analogy, and to maintain a\r\nphysical impossibility. But it is certain, that many of the native\r\nmetals have once been in a state of softness, because they bear on them\r\nimpressions which they could not have received but when they were soft.\r\nThus, gold is often impressed by quartz and other stones, which still\r\nadhere to it, or are involved in it. Specimens of quartz, containing\r\ngold and silver shooting through them, with the most beautiful and\r\nvaried ramifications, are every where to be met with in the cabinets of\r\nthe curious; and contain, in their structure, the clearest proof, that\r\nthe metal and the quartz have been both soft, and have crystallized\r\ntogether. By the compactness, also, of the body which they form, they\r\nshow, that when they acquired solidity, it was by the concretion of the\r\nwhole mass, and not by such partial concretion as takes place when a\r\nsolvent is separated from substances which it held in solution.\r\n\r\n52. Native copper is very abundant; and some specimens of it have been\r\nfound crystallized. Here the crystallization of the metal is a proof\r\nthat it has passed from a fluid to a solid state; and its purity is a\r\nproof that it did not make that transition by being precipitated from a\r\nmenstruum.\r\n\r\n53. Again, pieces of native manganese have been found possessing so\r\nexactly the characters peculiar to that metal when reduced in our\r\nfurnaces, that it is impossible to consider them as deriving their\r\nfigure and solidity from any cause but fusion. The ingenious author\r\nwho describes these specimens, La Peyrouse, was so forcibly struck\r\nwith this resemblance, that he immediately drew the same conclusion\r\nfrom it which is drawn here, attributing the only difference, which\r\nhe remarked between the native and the artificial _regulus_, to the\r\ndifferent energy with which the same agent works when employed by\r\nnature and by art.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 68. Journal de Phys.\r\nJanvier, 1786.]\r\n\r\n54. All these appearances conspire to prove, that the materials which\r\nfill the mineral veins were melted by heat, and forcibly injected, in\r\nthat state, into the clefts and fissures of the strata. These fissures\r\nwe must conceive to have arisen, not merely from the shrinking of the\r\nstrata while they acquired hardness and solidity, but from the violence\r\ndone to them, when they were heaved up and elevated in the manner which\r\nhas already been explained.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: NOTE XIII.]\r\n\r\n55. When these suppositions are once admitted, the other leading facts\r\nin the history of metallic veins will be readily accounted for. Thus,\r\nfor instance, it is evident to what we must ascribe the fragments of\r\nthe surrounding rock that are often found immersed in the veins, and\r\nencompassed on all sides by crystallized substances. These fragments\r\nbeing no doubt detached by the concussion, which at once tore asunder\r\nand elevated the strata, were sustained by the melted matter that\r\nflowed at the same time upward through the vein. Large masses of rock\r\nare often found in this manner completely insulated; one of these,\r\nwhich M. De Luc has described with great accuracy, is no less than a\r\nvast segment of a mountain.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Lettres Physiques, &c. tom. iii. P. 361.]\r\n\r\n56. The immense violence which has accompanied the formation of mineral\r\nveins, is particularly marked by the slips and shifts of the strata on\r\neach side of them all tending to show what mighty changes have taken\r\nplace in those regions, which our imagination erroneously paints as\r\nthe abode of everlasting silence and rest. This shifting of the strata\r\nis best observed, where the veins make a transverse section of beds of\r\nrock, considerably inclined to the horizon. There it is common to see\r\nthe beds on one side of the vein slipped along from the corresponding\r\nbeds on the other side, and removed sometimes in a horizontal,\r\nsometimes in an oblique direction. In this way, not only the strata\r\nare shifted, but veins, which intersect one another, are also shifted\r\nthemselves. They are _heaved_, as it is called in the significant\r\nlanguage of the miners, and forced out of their direction. It is\r\nimpossible, in such a case, but to connect in the mind the formation\r\nof the vein, and the production of the slips which accompany it, and to\r\nregard them as parts of the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\n57. Where these slips are horizontal, and exhibit great bodies of\r\nstrata carried from their place, while the parts of the transferred\r\nmass remain undisturbed relatively to one another, they furnish a dear\r\nproof, that this change of plaice has not arisen from the falling in\r\nof the roofs of caverns, as some geologists suppose. The horizontal\r\ndirection, and the regularity of the movement, are incompatible with\r\nthe action of such a cause as this; and indeed it is highly interesting\r\nto remark, in the midst of the signs of disturbance which prevail in\r\nthe bowels of the earth, that there reigns a certain symmetry and\r\norder, which indicate the action of a force of incredible magnitude,\r\nbut slow and gradual in its effects. The parts of the mass moved are\r\nundisturbed relatively to one another; what has been broken has been\r\ncemented; the breaches of continuity have been filled up and healed;\r\nand every where we see the operation of a cause that could unite as\r\nwell as separate. The twofold action of heat to expand and to melt,\r\ncould scarce be pointed out more clearly by any system of appearances.\r\n\r\n58. As a long period was no doubt required for the elevation of the\r\nstrata, the rents made in them are not all of the same date, nor the\r\nveins all of the same formation. This is clear in the case of one vein\r\nproducing a shift or slip in another; for the vein which forces the\r\nother out of its place, and preserves its own direction, is evidently\r\nthe more recent of the two, and must have had its materials in a\r\nstate of activity, when those of the other were inert. Sometimes,\r\nalso, at the intersection of two veins, we may trace the current of\r\nthe materials of the one, across those of the other; and here, of\r\nconsequence, the relative antiquity is determined just as in the former\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n59. The want of any appearance of stratification in mineral veins has\r\nalready been taken notice of. There is, however, to be observed, in\r\nmany instances, a tendency to a regular arrangement of the substances\r\ncontained in them; those of the same kind forming coats parallel to the\r\nsides of the vein, and nearly of an equal thickness. This phenomenon\r\nis considered as one of the strongest arguments in favour of the\r\nNeptunian system, but has nothing in it, in the least incompatible\r\nwith that theory which ascribes the formation of veins to the action\r\nof subterraneous heat. When melted matter from the mineral regions was\r\nthrown up into the veins, that which was nearest to the sides would\r\nsoonest lose its heat. The similar substances, also, would unite while\r\nthis process was going forward, and would crystallize, as in other\r\ncases of congelation, from the sides toward the interior. There is the\r\nmore reason for supposing this to have been the case, that the same\r\nsort of coating is often observed on the inside of close cavities,\r\nwhich are, nevertheless, so constructed, as to afford a demonstration\r\nthat no chemical solvent was ever included in them, (§ 74.) Some\r\nveins, it must also be considered, may have been filled by successive\r\ninjections of melted matter, and this would naturally give rise to a\r\nvariety of separate incrustations.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: See some farther remarks on this subject at NOTE XIII.]\r\n\r\n60. In the view now given of metallic veins, they have been considered\r\nas traversing only the stratified parts of the globe. They do,\r\nhowever, occasionally intersect the unstratified parts, particularly\r\nthe granite, the same vein often continuing its course across rocks\r\nof both kinds, without suffering any material change; and, if we have\r\nhitherto paid no attention to this circumstance, it is because the\r\norder pursued in this essay required, that the relation of the veins\r\nto stratified bodies should be first treated of. Besides, the facts\r\nin the natural history of veins, whether contained in stratified or\r\nunstratified rocks, are so nearly alike, that in a general view of\r\ngeology, they do not require to be distinguished. It is material to\r\nremark, that, though metallic veins are found indiscriminately in all\r\nthe different kinds of rock, whether stratified or otherwise, they are\r\nmost abundant in the class of primary schisti. All the countries most\r\nremarkable for their mines, and the mountains distinguished by the\r\nname of metalliferous, are primary, and the instance of Derbyshire is\r\nperhaps the most considerable exception to this rule that is known.\r\nThis preference, which the metals appear to give to the primary strata,\r\nis very consistent with Dr Hutton's theory, which represents the rocks\r\nof that order as being most changed from their original position, and\r\nthose on which the disturbing forces of the subterraneous regions have\r\nacted most frequently, and with greatest energy. The primary strata are\r\nthe lowest, also, and have the most direct communication with those\r\nregions from which the mineral veins derive all their riches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          2. _Of Whinstone._\r\n\r\n61. Beside the veins filled with spar, and containing the metallic\r\nores, the strata are intersected by veins of whinstone, porphyry, and\r\ngranite, the characters of which are next to be examined.\r\n\r\nThe term _whin_, or _whinstone_, with Dr. Hutton, like the word _trap_,\r\nwith the German mineralogists, denotes a class of stones, comprehending\r\nseveral distinct species, or at least varieties. The common _basalt_,\r\nthe _wacken_, _mullen_, and _crag_ of Kirwan, the _grûnstein_ of\r\nWerner, and the _amygdaloid_, are comprehended under the name of whin.\r\nAll these stones have a tendency to a spathose structure, and discover\r\nat least the rudiments of crystallization. They are, at the same time,\r\nwithout any mark of stratification in their internal texture, as they\r\nare also, for the most part, in their outward configuration; and, as\r\nthe different species here enumerated compose, not unfrequently, parts\r\nof the same continuous rock, the change from one to another being made\r\nthrough a series of insensible gradations, they may safely be regarded\r\nby the geologist as belonging to the same _genus_.\r\n\r\n62. Whin, though not stratified, exists in two different ways, that is,\r\neither in veins, (called in Scotland _dykes_,) traversing the strata\r\nlike the veins already described, or in irregular masses, incumbent\r\non the strata, and sometimes interposed between them. In both these\r\nforms, whinstone has nearly the same characters, and bears, in all its\r\nvarieties, a most striking resemblance to the lavas which have actually\r\nflowed from volcanoes on the surface of the earth. This resemblance\r\nis so great, that the two substances have been often mistaken for one\r\nanother; and many rocks, which have been pronounced to be the remains\r\nof extinguished volcanoes, by mineralogists of no inconsiderable\r\nname, have been found, on closer examination, to be nothing else than\r\nmasses or veins of whinstone. This latter stone is indeed only to be\r\ndistinguished from the former, by a careful examination of the internal\r\ncharacters of both; and chiefly from this circumstance, that whinstone\r\noften contains calcareous spar and zeolite, whereas neither of these\r\nsubstances is found in such lavas, as are certainly known to have been\r\nthrown out by volcanic explosions.\r\n\r\nNow, from these circumstances of affinity between lava and whinstone,\r\non the one hand, and of diversity on the other, as the formation of\r\nthe one is known, it should seem that some probable conclusion may be\r\ndrawn concerning the formation of the other. The affinity in question\r\nis constant and essential; the difference variable and accidental;\r\nand this naturally leads to suspect, that the two stones have the\r\nsame origin; and that, as lava is certainly a production of fire, so\r\nprobably is whinstone.\r\n\r\n63. But, in order to see whether this hypothesis will explain the\r\ndiversity of the two substances, without which it will not be entitled\r\nto much attention, we must remark, that the presence of carbonate of\r\nlime in a body that has been fused, argues, agreeably to the principles\r\nformerly explained, that the fusion was brought about under a great\r\ncompressing force, that is to say, deep in the bowels of the earth, or\r\nin the great laboratory of the mineral regions. We are, therefore, to\r\nsuppose that the fusion of the whin was performed in those regions,\r\nwhere the compression was sufficient to preserve the carbonic gas in\r\nunion with the calcareous earth, so that these two substances melted\r\ntogether, and, on cooling, crystallized into spar. In the lavas, again,\r\nthrown out by volcanic eruption, the fusion, as we know, wherever it\r\nmay begin, continues in the open air, where the pressure is only that\r\nof the atmosphere: the calcareous earth, which, therefore, may have\r\nbeen, in the form of a carbonate, among the materials of this lava,\r\nmust be converted into quicklime, and become infusible; hence the want\r\nof calcareous spar in lavas that have flowed at the surface.\r\n\r\nThus, whinstone is to be accounted a subterraneous, or _unerupted_\r\nlava; and our theory has the advantage of explaining both the affinity\r\nand the difference between these stony bodies, without the introduction\r\nof any new hypothesis. In the Neptunian system, the affinity of\r\nwhinstone and lava is a paradox which admits of no solution.\r\n\r\n64. The columnar structure sometimes found in that species of whinstone\r\ncalled basaltes, is a fact which has given rise to much discussion;\r\nand it must be confessed, that though one of the most striking and\r\npeculiar characters of this fossil, it is not that which gives the\r\nclearest and most direct information concerning its origin. One\r\ncircumstance, however, very much in favour of the opinion that basaltic\r\nrocks owe their formation to fire, is, that the columnar form is\r\nsometimes assumed by the lava actually erupted from volcanoes. Now, it\r\nis certainly of no small importance, to have the synthetic argument\r\non our side, and to know, that basaltic columns can be produced by\r\nfire; though, no doubt, to give absolute certainty to our conclusion,\r\nit would be necessary to show, that there are in nature no other\r\nmeans but this by which these columns can be formed. This sort of\r\nevidence is hardly to be looked for; but since the power of fusion,\r\nto produce the phenomena in question, is perfectly established, and\r\nsince the production of the same phenomena in the humid way is a mere\r\nhypothesis, if there be the least reason to suspect the action of\r\nsubterraneous heat as one of the causes of mineralization, every maxim\r\nof sound philosophy requires that the basaltic structure, in all cases,\r\nshould be ascribed to it.\r\n\r\n65. The Neptunists will no doubt allege, with BERGMAN, that, in the\r\ndrying of starch, clay, and a few other substances, something analogous\r\nto basaltic columns is produced. Here, however, a most important\r\ndifference is to be remarked, corresponding very exactly to one of the\r\ncharacters which we have all along observed to distinguish the products\r\nof aqueous, from those of igneous consolidation. The columns formed\r\nby the substances just mentioned, are distant from one another: they\r\nare separated by fissures which widen from the bottom to the top, and\r\nwhich arise from the shrinking and drying of the mass. In the basaltic\r\ncolumns, no such openings, nor vacuity of any kind is found; the\r\npillars are in contact, and, though perfectly distinct, are so close,\r\nthat the sharp edge of a wedge can hardly be introduced between them.\r\nThis is a great peculiarity in the basaltic structure, and is strongly\r\nexpressive of this fact, that the mass was all fluid together, and\r\nthat its parts took their new arrangement, not in consequence of the\r\nseparation of a fluid from a solid part, by which great shrinking and\r\nmuch empty space might be produced; but in consequence of a cause\r\nwhich, like refrigeration, acted equally on all the parts of the mass,\r\nand preserved their absolute contact after their fluidity had ceased.\r\n\r\n66. A mark of fusion, or at least of the operation of heat, which\r\nwhinstone possesses in common with many other minerals, is its being\r\npenetrated by pyrites, a substance, as has been already remarked, that\r\nis of all others most exclusively the production of fire. Another\r\nmark of fusion, more distinctive of whin, is, that both in veins and\r\nin masses it sometimes includes pieces of sandstone, or of the other\r\ncontiguous strata, completely insulated, and having the appearance\r\nof fragments of rock, floating in a fluid sufficiently dense and\r\nponderous to sustain their weight. Though these fragments have been\r\ntoo refractory to be reduced into fusion themselves, they have not\r\nremained entirely unchanged, but are, in general, extremely indurated,\r\nin comparison of the rock from which they appear to have been detached.\r\n\r\n67. Similar instances of extraordinary induration are observed in the\r\nparts of the strata in contact with whinstone, whether they form the\r\nsides of the veins, or the floors, and roofs of the masses into which\r\nthe whinstone is distributed. The strata whether sandy or argillaceous,\r\nin such situations, are usually extremely hard and consolidated; the\r\nformer in particular lose their granulated texture, and are sometimes\r\nconverted into perfect jasper. This interesting remark was first made\r\nby Dr Hutton, and the truth of it has been verified by a great number\r\nof subsequent observations.\r\n\r\n68. To the same excellent geologist we are indebted for the knowledge\r\nof an analogous fact, attendant on the passage of whinstone veins\r\nthrough coal strata. As the beds of stone where they are in contact\r\nwith veins of whin, seem to acquire additional induration, so those\r\nof coal, in like circumstances, are frequently found to have lost\r\ntheir fusibility, and to be reduced nearly to the condition of coke,\r\nor of charcoal. The existence of coal of this kind has been already\r\nmentioned, and considered as a proof of the operation of subterraneous\r\nheat. In the instances here referred to, that is, where the charring\r\nof the coal is limited to those parts of the strata which are in\r\ncontact with the whin, or in its immediate vicinity, the heat is\r\npointed out as residing in the vein; and this is to be accounted for\r\nonly on the supposition of the melted whin, at a period subsequent to\r\nthe consolidation of the coal, having flowed through the openings of\r\nthe strata. The heat has been powerful enough, in many cases, to drive\r\noff the bituminous matter of the coal, and to force it into colder and\r\nmore distant parts. Few facts, in the history of fossils, are more\r\nremarkable than this, and none more directly assimilates the operations\r\nof the mineral regions, with those that take place at the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n69. Again, the disturbance of the strata, wherever veins of whinstone\r\nabound, if not a direct proof of the original fluidity of the\r\nwhinstone, is a clear indication of the violence with which it was\r\nintroduced into its place. This disturbance of the position of the\r\nstrata, by shifting, unusual elevation, and other irregularities, where\r\nthey are intersected by whinstone veins, is a fact so well known to\r\nminers, that when they meet with any sudden change in the lying of the\r\n_metals_, they are wont to foretell their approach to masses, or veins\r\nof unstratified matter; and, in their figurative language, point them\r\nout as the causes of the confusion with which they are so generally\r\naccompanied.[21] The mineral veins likewise, as well as the strata, are\r\noften heaved and shifted by the veins of whinstone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: A _Trouble_ is the name which the colliers in this\r\ncountry give to a vein of whinstone.]\r\n\r\n70. Whinstone of every species is found frequently interposed in\r\ntabular masses, between beds of stratified rocks; and it then adds to\r\nthe indications of its igneous origin, already enumerated, some others\r\nthat are peculiar to it when in this situation. In such instances, it\r\nis not uncommon to find the strata in some places, contiguous to the\r\nwhin, elevated, and bent with their concavity upward, so that they\r\nappear clearly to have been acted on by a force that proceeded from\r\nbelow, at the same time that they were softened, and rendered in some\r\ndegree flexible: it is needless to remark, that these effects can be\r\nexplained by nothing but the fusion of the whin; and that the great\r\nforce with which it was impelled against the strata, could be produced\r\nby no cause but heat, acting in the manner that is here supposed.\r\n\r\n71. Again, if it be true that the masses of whin, thus interposed\r\namong the strata, were introduced there, after the formation of the\r\nlatter, we might expect to find, at least in many instances, that the\r\nbeds on which the whinstone rests, and those by which it is covered,\r\nare exactly alike. If these beds were once contiguous, and have been\r\nonly heaved up and separated by the irruption of a fluid mass of\r\nsubterraneous lava, their identity should still be recognised. Now,\r\nthis is precisely what is observed; it is known to hold in a vast\r\nnumber of instances, and is strikingly exemplified in the rock of\r\n_Salisbury Crag_, near Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThis similarity of the strata that cover the masses of whinstone,\r\nto those that serve as the base on which they rest, and again the\r\ndissimilitude of both to the interposed mass, are facts which I think\r\ncan hardly receive any explanation, on the principles of the Neptunian\r\ntheory. If these rocks, both stratified and unstratified, are to be\r\nregarded as productions of the sea, the circumstances would require to\r\nbe pointed out, which have determined the whinstone, and the beds that\r\nare all round it, to be so extremely unlike in their structure, though\r\nformed at the same time, and in the immediate vicinity of one another;\r\nas also those circumstances, on the other hand, which determined the\r\nstratified deposits above and below the whinstone, to be precisely\r\nthe same, though the times of their formation must have been very\r\ndifferent. The homogeneous substances, thus, placed at a distance, and\r\nthe heterogeneous brought so closely together, are phenomena equally\r\nunaccountable, in a theory that ascribes their origin to the operation\r\nof the same element, and that necessarily dates their formation\r\naccording to the order in which they lie, one above another.\r\n\r\n72. If, indeed, in these instances, the gradation were insensible, as\r\nsome have asserted it to be, between the strata and the interposed\r\nmass, so that it was impossible to point out the line where the one\r\nended and the other began, whatever difficulties we might perceive in\r\nthe Neptunian theory, we should find it hard to substitute a better\r\nin its room. But the truth seems to be, that, in the cases we are now\r\ntreating of, no such gradation exists; and that, though where the two\r\nkinds of rock come into contact a change is often observed, by the\r\nstrata having acquired an additional degree of induration, yet the line\r\nof separation is well defined, and can be precisely ascertained. This\r\nat least is certain, that innumerable specimens, exhibiting such lines\r\nof separation, are to be met with; and wherever care has been taken\r\nto obtain a fresh fracture of the stone, and to remove the effects of\r\naccidental causes, even where the two rocks are most firmly united,\r\nand most closely assimilated, I am persuaded that no uncertainty has\r\never remained as to the line of their separation. For these reasons,\r\nit seems probable that the gradual transition of basaltes into the\r\nadjoining strata, is in all cases imaginary, and is, in truth, a mere\r\nillusion, proceeding from hasty and inaccurate observation.\r\n\r\n73. Another remarkable fact in the natural history of the whinstone\r\nrocks, remains yet to be mentioned, and with it I shall conclude the\r\nargument, as far as these rocks are concerned.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of whinstone are the common matrices of agates and\r\nchalcedonies, which lie inclosed in them in the form of round nodules.\r\nThe original fluidity of these nodules is evinced by their figured, and\r\nsometimes crystallized structure, and indeed is so generally admitted,\r\nthat the only question concerning them is, whether this fluidity\r\nwas the effect of heat or of solution. To answer this question, Dr\r\nHutton observes, that the formation of the concentric coats, of which\r\nthe agate is usually composed, has evidently proceeded from the\r\ncircumference toward the centre, the exterior coats always impressing\r\nthe interior, but never the reverse. The same thing also follows from\r\nthis other fact, that when there is any vacuity within the agate, it is\r\nusually at the centre, and there too are found the regular crystals,\r\nwhen any such have been formed. It therefore appears certain, that the\r\nprogress of consolidation has been from the circumference inwards, and\r\nthat the outward coats of the agate were the first to acquire solidity\r\nand hardness.\r\n\r\n74. Now, it must be considered that these coats are highly\r\nconsolidated; that they are of very pure siliceous matter, and are\r\nutterly impervious to every substance which we know of, except light\r\nand heat. It is plain, therefore, that whatever at any time, during\r\nthe progress of consolidation, was contained within the coats already\r\nformed, must have remained there as long as the agate was entire,\r\nwithout the least possibility of escape. But nothing is found within\r\nthe coats of the agate save its own substance; therefore, no extraneous\r\nsubstance, that is to say no solvent, was ever included within them.\r\nThe fluidity of the agate was therefore simple, and unassisted by any\r\nmenstruum.\r\n\r\nIn this argument, nothing appears to me wanting, that is necessary to\r\nthe perfection of a physical, I had almost said of a mathematical,\r\ndemonstration. It seems, indeed, to be impossible that the igneous\r\norigin of fossils could be recorded in plainer language, than by the\r\nphenomenon which has just been described.\r\n\r\n75. The examination of particular specimens of agates and chalcedonies,\r\naffords many more arguments of the same kind, which Dr Hutton used to\r\ndeduce with an acuteness and vivacity, which his friends have often\r\nlistened to with great admiration and delight.[22] These, however,\r\nmust be passed over at present; and I have only further to remark,\r\nthat a series of the most interesting experiments, instituted by Sir\r\nJAMES HALL, and published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh,[23] has removed the only remaining objection that could\r\nbe urged against the igneous origin of whinstone. This objection is\r\nfounded on the common observation, that when a piece of whinstone or\r\nbasaltes is actually melted in a crucible, on cooling, it becomes\r\nglass, and loses its original character entirely; and from thence it\r\nwas concluded, that this character had not been originally produced\r\nby fusion. The experiments above mentioned, however, have shown, in\r\nthe most satisfactory manner, that melted whin, by _regulated_ or by\r\nslow cooling, is prevented from assuming the appearance of glass, and\r\nbecomes a stony substance, hardly to be distinguished from whinstone or\r\nlava.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: NOTE XVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: vol. v. p. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of another ingenious chemist, Dr KENNEDY, have shown,\r\nthat whinstone contains mineral alkali, by which, of course, its fusion\r\nmust have been assisted.[24] Dr Hutton used to ascribe its fusibility,\r\nin a great measure at least, to the quantity of iron contained in it:\r\nboth these causes have no doubt united to render it more easily melted\r\nthan the ordinary materials of the strata.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Trans. R. S. Edin. vol. v. p. 85.]\r\n\r\n76. In a word, therefore, to conceive aright the origin of that class\r\nof unstratified rocks, distinguished by the name of whinstone, we must\r\nsuppose, that long after the consolidation of the strata, and during\r\nthe time of their elevation, the materials of the former were melted\r\nby the force of subterraneous heat, and injected among the rents and\r\nfissures of the rocks already formed. In this manner were produced\r\nthe veins or dikes of whinstone; and, where circumstances allowed\r\nthe stream of melted matter to diffuse itself more widely, tabular\r\nmasses were formed, which were afterwards raised up, together with the\r\nsurrounding strata, above the level of the sea, and have been since\r\nlaid open by the operation of those causes that continually change and\r\nwaste the surface of the land.\r\n\r\nThese unstratified rocks are not, however, all the work of the same\r\nperiod; they differ evidently in the date of their formation, and it is\r\nnot unusual, to find tabular masses of one species of whin, intersected\r\nby veins of another species. Indeed, of all the fossil bodies which\r\ncompose the present land, the veins of whin appear to be the most\r\nrecently consolidated.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: NOTE XIV.]\r\n\r\nPorphyry may so properly be regarded as a variety of whin,\r\ndistinguished only by involving crystallized feldspar, that, in a\r\ngeological sketch like the present, it is hardly entitled to a separate\r\narticle. Like the other kinds of whin, it exists both in veins and\r\nin tabular masses, having, no doubt, an origin similar to that which\r\nhas just been described. Porphyry, however, has the peculiarity of\r\nbeing rarely found in any but the primary strata; it seems to be the\r\nwhinstone of the old world, or at least that which is of the highest\r\nantiquity in the present. It no where, I believe, assumes a columnar,\r\nor basaltic appearance, of any regularity; but this is also true of\r\nmany other varieties of whin, of all, indeed, except the most compact\r\nand homogeneous. These differences are not so considerable as to\r\nrequire our entering into any particular detail concerning the natural\r\nhistory of this fossil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             3. _Granite_.\r\n\r\n77. The term Granite is used by Dr Hutton to signify an aggregate\r\nstone, in which quartz, feldspar, and mica are found distinct from\r\none another, and not disposed in layers. The addition of hornblende,\r\nschorl, or garnet, to the three ingredients just mentioned, is not\r\nunderstood to alter the _genus_ of the stone, but only to constitute a\r\nspecific difference, which it is the business of lithology to mark by\r\nsome appropriate character, annexed to the generic name of granite.\r\n\r\nThe fossil now defined exists, like whinstone and porphyry, both in\r\nmasses and in veins, though most frequently in the former. It is like\r\nthem unstratified in its texture, and is regarded here, as being also\r\nunstratified in its outward structure.[26] One ingredient which is\r\nessential to granite, namely, quartz, is not contained in whinstone;\r\nand this circumstance serves to distinguish these _genera_ from one\r\nanother, though, in other respects, they seem to be united by a chain\r\nof insensible gradations, from the most homogeneous basaltes, to\r\ngranite the most highly crystallized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Those rocks that consist of the ingredients here\r\nenumerated, if they have at the same time a schistose texture, or a\r\ndisposition into layers, are properly distinguished from granite, and\r\ncalled Gneiss, or Granitic Schistus. But it has been questioned whether\r\na stone does not exist composed of these ingredients, and destitute\r\nof a schistose texture, but yet divided into large beds, visible in\r\nits external form. Dr Hutton supposes such a stone not to exist, or at\r\nleast not to constitute any such proportion of the mineral kingdom, as\r\nto entitle it to particular consideration, in the general speculations\r\nof geology.\r\n\r\nWhether this supposition is perfectly correct, may require to be\r\nfarther considered: this, however, is certain, that a rock, in all\r\nrespects conformable to it, composes a great proportion of what are\r\nusually called the granite mountains. See NOTE XV.]\r\n\r\n78. Granite, it has been just said, exists most commonly in masses; and\r\nthese masses are rarely, if ever, incumbent on any other rock: they are\r\nthe basis on which others rest, and seem, for the most part, to rise\r\nup from under the ancient, or primary strata. The granite, therefore,\r\nwherever it is found, is inferior to every other rock; and as it also\r\ncomposes many of the greatest mountains, it has the peculiarity of\r\nbeing elevated the highest into the atmosphere, and sunk the deepest\r\nunder the surface, of all the mineral substances with which we are\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the circumstance of not being alternated with\r\nstratified bodies, which constitutes a remarkable difference between\r\ngranite and whinstone, the affinity of these fossils is such as to make\r\nthe similarity of their origin by no means improbable. Accordingly,\r\nin Dr Hutton's theory, granite is regarded as a stone of more recent\r\nformation than the strata incumbent on it; as a substance which has\r\nbeen melted by heat, and which, when forced up from the mineral\r\nregions, has elevated the strata at the same time.\r\n\r\n79. That granite has undergone a change from a fluid to a solid\r\nstate, is evinced from the crystallized structure in which some of\r\nits component parts are usually found. This crystallization is\r\nparticularly to be remarked of the feldspar, and also of the schorl,\r\nwhere there is any admixture of that substance, whether in slender\r\nspiculæ, or in larger masses. The quartz itself is in some cases\r\ncrystallized, and is so, perhaps, more frequently than is generally\r\nsupposed. The fluidity of granite, in some former period of its\r\nexistence, is so evident from this, as to make it appear singular that\r\nit should ever have been considered as a fossil that had remained\r\nalways the same, and one, into the origin of which it was needless to\r\ninquire. If the regular forms of crystallization are not to be received\r\nas proofs of the substance to which they belong having passed from\r\na fluid to a solid state, neither are the figures of shells and of\r\nother supposed petrifactions, to be taken as indications of a passage\r\nfrom the animal to the mineral kingdom; so that there is an end of\r\nall geological theories, and of all reasonings concerning the ancient\r\ncondition of the globe. To an argument which strikes equally at the\r\nroot of all theories, it belongs not to this, in particular, to make\r\nany reply.\r\n\r\n80. We shall, therefore, consider it as admitted, that the materials\r\nof the granite were originally fluid; and, in addition to this, we\r\nthink it can easily be proved, that this fluidity was not that of the\r\nelements taken separately, but of the entire mass. This last conclusion\r\nfollows, from the structure of those specimens, where one of the\r\nsubstances is impressed by the forms which are peculiar to another.\r\nThus, in the Portsoy granite,[27] which Dr Hutton has so minutely\r\ndescribed, the quartz is impressed by the rhomboidal crystals of the\r\nfeldspar, and the stone thus formed is compact and highly consolidated.\r\nHence, this granite is not a congeries of parts, which, after being\r\nseparately formed, were somehow brought together and agglutinated; but\r\nit is certain that the quartz, at least, was fluid when it was moulded\r\non the feldspar. In other granites, the impressions of the substances\r\non one another are observed in a different order, and the quartz gives\r\nits form to the feldspar. This, however, is more unusual; the quartz\r\nis commonly the substance which has received the impressions of all\r\nthe rest; and the spiculæ of schorl often shoot both across it and the\r\nfeldspar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 104.]\r\n\r\nThe ingredients of granite were therefore fluid when mixed, or at least\r\nwhen in contact with one another. Now, this fluidity was not the effect\r\nof solution in a menstruum; for, in that case, one kind of crystal\r\nought not to impress another, but each of them should have its own\r\npeculiar shape.\r\n\r\n81. The perfect consolidation of many granites, furnishes an argument\r\nto the same effect. For, agreeably to what was already observed, in\r\ntreating of the strata, a substance, when crystallizing, or passing\r\nfrom a fluid to a solid state, cannot be free from porosity, much\r\nless fill up completely a space of a given form, if, at the same\r\ntime, any solvent is separated from it; because the solvent so\r\nseparated would still occupy a certain space, and, when removed by\r\nevaporation or otherwise, would leave that space empty. The perfect\r\nadjustment, therefore, of the shape of one set of crystallizing bodies,\r\nto the shape of another set, as in the Portsoy granite, and their\r\nconsolidation into one mass, is as strong a proof as could be desired,\r\nthat they crystallized from a state of simple fluidity, such as, of all\r\nknown causes, heat alone is able to produce.\r\n\r\n82. This conclusion, however, does not rest on a single class of\r\nfacts. It has been observed in many instances, that where granite and\r\nstratified rocks, such as primary schistus, are in contact, the latter\r\nare penetrated by veins of the former, which traverse them in various\r\ndirections. These veins are of different dimensions, some being of the\r\nbreadth of several yards, others of a few inches, or even tenths of an\r\ninch; they diminish as they recede from the main body of the granite,\r\nto which they are always firmly united, constituting, indeed, a part of\r\nthe same continued rock.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena, which were first distinctly observed by Dr Hutton, are\r\nof great importance in geology, and afford a clear solution of the two\r\nchief questions concerning the relation between granite and schistus.\r\nAs every vein must be of a date posterior to the body in which it is\r\ncontained, it follows, that the schistus was not super-imposed on\r\nthe granite, after the formation of this last. If it be argued, that\r\nthese veins, though posterior to the schisti, are also posterior to\r\nthe granite, and were formed by the infiltration of water in which the\r\ngranite was dissolved or suspended; it may be replied, _1mo_, That the\r\npower of water to dissolve granite, is a postulatum of the same kind\r\nthat we have so often, and for such good reason, refused to concede;\r\nand, _2do_, That in many instances the veins proceed from the main\r\nbody of the granite _upwards_ into the schistus; so that they are in\r\nplanes much elevated in respect of the horizon, and have a direction\r\nquite opposite to that which the hypothesis of infiltration requires.\r\nIt remains certain, therefore, that the whole mass of granite, and the\r\nveins proceeding from it, are coeval, and both of later formation than\r\nthe strata.\r\n\r\nNow, this being established, and the fluidity of the veins, when they\r\npenetrated into the schistus, being obvious, it necessarily follows,\r\nthat the whole granite mass was also fluid at the same time. But this\r\ncan have been brought about only by subterraneous heat, which also\r\nimpelled the melted matter against the superincumbent strata, with such\r\nforce as to raise them from their place, and to give them that highly\r\ninclined position in which they are still supported by the granite,\r\nafter its fluidity has ceased. Thus a conclusion, rendered probable by\r\nthe crystallization of granite, is established beyond all contradiction\r\nby the phenomena of granitic veins.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: NOTE XV.]\r\n\r\n83. With the granite, we shall consider the proof of the igneous origin\r\nof all mineral substances as completed. These substances, therefore,\r\nwhether stratified or unstratified, owe their consolidation to the same\r\ncause, though acting with different degrees of energy. The stratified\r\nhave been in general only softened or penetrated by melted matter,\r\nwhereas the unstratified have been reduced into perfect fusion.\r\n\r\n84. In this general conclusion we may distinguish two parts, which, in\r\ntheir degree of certainty, differ perhaps somewhat from one another.\r\nThe first of these, and that which stands highest in point of evidence,\r\nconsists of two propositions; namely, that the fluidity which preceded\r\nthe consolidation of mineral substances was SIMPLE, that is, it did not\r\narise from the combination of these substances with any solvent; and,\r\nnext, that after consolidation, these bodies have been raised up by an\r\nexpansive force acting from below, and have by that means been brought\r\ninto their present situation. These two propositions seem to me to be\r\nsupported by all the evidence that is necessary to constitute the most\r\nperfect demonstration.\r\n\r\n85. The other part of the general conclusion, that fire, or more\r\nproperly heat, was the cause of the fluidity of these mineral bodies,\r\nand also of their subsequent elevation, is not perhaps to be considered\r\nas a truth so fully demonstrated as the two preceding propositions;\r\nit is, no doubt, a matter of THEORY; or a portion of one of those\r\ninvisible chains by which men seek to connect in the mind the state\r\nof nature that is present, with the states of it that are past; and\r\nparticipates of that uncertainty from which our reasonings concerning\r\nsuch causes as are not direct objects of perception, are hardly ever\r\nexempted. That it participates of this uncertainty in a very slight\r\ndegree, will, however, be admitted, when it is considered that the\r\ncause assigned has been proved sufficient for the effect; that the same\r\nis not true of any other known cause; and that this theory accounts,\r\nwith singular simplicity and precision, for a system of facts so\r\nvarious and complex, as that which is presented by the natural history\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\n86. Neither can it be said that the existence of subterraneous heat is\r\na principle assumed without any evidence, but that of the geological\r\nfacts which it is intended to explain: on the contrary, it is proved by\r\nphenomena within the circle of ordinary experience, namely, those of\r\nhot springs, volcanoes, and earthquakes. These leave no doubt of the\r\nexistence of heat, and of a moving and expansive power, in the bowels\r\nof the earth; so that the only questions are, at what depth is this\r\npower lodged? to what extent, and with what intensity, does it act?\r\nThat it is lodged at a very considerable depth, is rendered probable by\r\nthe permanency of some of the preceding phenomena: from the earliest\r\ntimes many fountains have retained their heat to the present day; and\r\nvolcanoes, though they become extinguished at length, have a very\r\nlong period allotted for their duration. The cause of earthquakes is\r\ncertainly a force that resides very deep under the surface, otherwise\r\nthe extent of the concussion could not be such as has been observed in\r\nmany instances.\r\n\r\n87. The intensity of volcanic fire, is another circumstance that\r\nfavours the opinion of its being seated deep under the surface. That\r\nthis intensity is considerable, is certain from the experiments made\r\nby Sir James Hall on the fusibility of whinstone and lava; from which\r\nit appears, that the lowest temperature in which either of these\r\nstones melt, is about 80° of Wedgewood's pyrometer. Some mineralogists\r\nhave indeed affirmed, that lava is melted, not by the intensity of\r\nthe heat applied to it, but in consequence of a certain combination\r\nformed between it and bituminous substances, in a manner which they do\r\nnot attempt to explain, and which has indeed no analogy to any thing\r\nthat is known. That a hypothesis, formed in such direct opposition to\r\nthe most obvious principles of inductive reasoning, should have been\r\nimagined by a philosopher who had examined the phenomena of Etna and\r\nVesuvius with much attention, and described them with great accuracy\r\nand truth, is more wonderful than that it should have been adopted by\r\nmineralogists, whose views of nature may have been confined within a\r\ncabinet or a laboratory. It is, however, a hypothesis, which, having\r\nnever had any support but from other hypotheses, hardly merited the\r\ndirect refutation that it has received from the experiments just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n88. But, if the intensity of volcanic heat be such as is here\r\nstated, it will be found very difficult to account for a fire of\r\nsuch activity, and of such long continuance in the same spot, by any\r\ndecomposition of mineral substances near the surface. In the place\r\nwhere this combustion is supposed to exist, it must be remembered,\r\nthat there is no fresh supply of materials to replace those that have\r\nbeen consumed, and that, therefore, the original accumulation of these\r\nmaterials in one spot, must have been very unlike any thing that has\r\never been observed concerning the disposition of minerals in the bowels\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n89. If, on the other hand, we ascribe the phenomena of volcanoes to\r\nthe central heat, the account that may be given of them is simple, and\r\nconsistent with itself. According to all the appearances from which the\r\nexistence of such heat has been inferred above, it is of a nature so\r\nfar different from ordinary fire, that it may require no circulation\r\nof air, and no supply of combustible materials to support it. It is\r\nnot accompanied with inflammation or combustion, the great pressure\r\npreventing any separation of parts in the substances on which it acts,\r\nand the absence of that elastic fluid without which heat seems to have\r\nno power to decompose bodies, even the most combustible, contributing\r\nto the unalterable nature of all the substances in the mineral regions.\r\nThere, of consequence, the only effects of heat are fusion and\r\nexpansion; and that which forms the nucleus of the globe may therefore\r\nbe a fluid mass, melted, but unchanged by the action of heat.\r\n\r\n90. If, from the confines of this nucleus, we conceive certain fissures\r\nand openings to traverse the solid crust, and to issue at the surface\r\nof the earth, the vapours ascending through these may in time heat the\r\nsides of the tubes through which they pass to a vast distance from the\r\nlower extremities. It is, indeed, difficult to fix the limit to which\r\nthis distance may extend, on account of the great difference between\r\nthe rate at which heat moves when it has a fluid for its vehicle, and\r\nwhen it is left to make its way alone through a solid body. In the\r\npresent case, the supply of heat is rapid, as being made by a vapour\r\nascending through a tube of solid rock; and the dissipation of it slow,\r\nas arising from its transmission through the rock. The waste of heat is\r\ntherefore small, compared with the supply, and grows smaller at every\r\ngiven point, the longer the stream of heated vapour has continued to\r\nflow. Such a stream, therefore, though it may at first be condensed\r\nwithin a small distance of its source, will in time reach higher\r\nand higher, and may at last be able to carry its heat to an immense\r\ndistance from the place of its original derivation. Thus, it is easy\r\nto conceive, that vapours from the mineral regions may convey their\r\nheat to reservoirs of water near the surface of the earth, and may in\r\nthat manner produce hot springs, and even boiling fountains, like those\r\nof Rycum and Geyser.\r\n\r\n91. When, instead of a heated vapour, melted matter is thrown up\r\nthrough the _shafts_ or _tubes_, which thus communicate with the\r\nmineral regions, veins of whinstone and basaltes are formed in the\r\ninterior of the earth. When the melted matter reaches to the surface,\r\nit is thrown out in the form of lava, and all the other phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes are produced.\r\n\r\nLastly, where melted matter of this kind, or vapours without being\r\ncondensed, have their progress obstructed, those dreadful concussions\r\nare produced, which seem to threaten the existence even of the earth\r\nitself. Though terrible, therefore, to the present inhabitants of the\r\nglobe, the earthquake has its place in the great system of geological\r\noperations, and is part of a series of events, essential, as will more\r\nclearly appear hereafter, to the general order, and to the preservation\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nSuch, according to this theory, are the changes which have befallen\r\nmineral substances in the bowels of the earth; and though different\r\nfor the stratified and unstratified parts of those substances, they\r\nare connected together by the same _principle_, or explained by the\r\nsame _cause_. It remains to consider that part of the history of both\r\nwhich describes their changes after their elevation to the surface;\r\nand here we shall find new causes introduced, which are more directly\r\nthe subjects of observation, than those hitherto treated of; causes,\r\nalso, which act on all fossils alike, and alike prepare them for their\r\nultimate destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION III.\r\n\r\n                 OF THE PHENOMENA COMMON TO STRATIFIED\r\n                       AND UNSTRATIFIED BODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. THE series of changes which fossil bodies are destined to undergo,\r\ndoes not cease with their elevation above the level of the sea; it\r\nassumes, however, a new direction, and from the moment that they are\r\nraised up to the surface, is constantly exerted in reducing them again\r\nunder the dominion of the ocean. The solidity is now destroyed which\r\nwas acquired in the bowels of the earth; and as the bottom of the\r\nsea is the great laboratory, where loose materials are mineralized\r\nand formed into stone, the atmosphere is the region where stones are\r\ndecomposed, and again resolved into earth.\r\n\r\nThis decomposition of all mineral substances, exposed to the air,\r\nis continual, and is brought about by a multitude of agents, both\r\nchemical and mechanical, of which some are known to us, and many, no\r\ndoubt, remain to be discovered. Among the various aëriform fluids which\r\ncompose our atmosphere, one is already distinguished as the grand\r\nprinciple of mineral decomposition; the others are not inactive, and\r\nto them we must add moisture, heat, and perhaps light; substances\r\nwhich, from their affinities to the elements of mineral bodies, have a\r\npower of entering into combination with them, and of thus diminishing\r\nthe forces by which they are united to one another. By the action of\r\nair and moisture, the metallic particles, particularly the iron, which\r\nenters in great abundance into the composition of almost all fossils,\r\nbecomes oxydated in such a degree as to lose its tenacity; so that the\r\ntexture of the surface is destroyed, and a part of the body resolved\r\ninto earth.\r\n\r\n93. Some earths, again, such as the calcareous, are immediately\r\ndissolved by water; and though the quantity so dissolved be extremely\r\nsmall, the operation, by being continually renewed, produces a slow\r\nbut perpetual corrosion, by which the greatest rocks must in time be\r\nsubdued. The action of water in destroying hard bodies into which it\r\nhas obtained entrance, is much assisted by the vicissitudes of heat\r\nand cold, especially when the latter extends as far as the point of\r\ncongelation; for the water, when frozen, occupies a greater space than\r\nbefore, and if the body is compact enough to refuse room for this\r\nexpansion, its parts are torn asunder by a repulsive force acting in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\n94. Besides these causes of mineral decomposition, the action of which\r\nwe can in some measure trace, there are others known to us only by\r\ntheir effects.\r\n\r\nWe see, for instance, the purest rock crystal affected by exposure\r\nto the weather, its lustre tarnished, and the polish of its surface\r\nimpaired, but we know nothing of the power by which these operations\r\nare performed. Thus also, in the precautions which the mineralogist\r\ntakes to preserve the fresh fracture of his specimens, we have a proof\r\nhow indiscriminately all the productions of the fossil kingdom are\r\nexposed to the attacks of their unknown enemies, and we perceive how\r\ndifficult it is to delay the beginnings of a process which no power\r\nwhatever can finally counteract.\r\n\r\n95. The mechanical forces employed in the disintegration of mineral\r\nsubstances, are more easily marked than the chemical. Here again water\r\nappears as the most active enemy of hard and solid bodies; and, in\r\nevery state, from transparent vapour to solid ice, from the smallest\r\nrill to the greatest river, it attacks whatever has emerged above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and labours incessantly to restore it to the deep.\r\nThe parts loosened and disengaged by the chemical agents, are carried\r\ndown by the rains, and, in their descent, rub and grind the superficies\r\nof other bodies. Thus water, though incapable of acting on hard\r\nsubstances by direct attrition, is the cause of their being so acted\r\non; and, when it descends in torrents, carrying with it sand, gravel,\r\nand fragments of rock, it may be truly said to turn the forces of the\r\nmineral kingdom against itself. Every separation which it makes is\r\nnecessarily permanent, and the parts once detached can never be united,\r\nsave at the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\n96. But it would far exceed the limits of this sketch, to pursue\r\nthe causes of mineral decomposition through all their forms. It is\r\nsufficient to remark, that the consequence of so many minute, but\r\nindefatigable agents, all working together, and having _gravity_ in\r\ntheir favour, is a system of universal decay and degradation, which\r\nmay be traced over the whole surface of the land, from the mountain\r\ntop to the sea shore. That we may perceive the full evidence of this\r\ntruth, one of the most important in the natural history of the globe,\r\nwe will begin our survey from the latter of these stations, and retire\r\ngradually toward the former.\r\n\r\n97. If the coast is bold and rocky, it speaks a language easy to\r\nbe interpreted. Its broken and abrupt contour, the deep gulfs and\r\nsalient promontories by which it is indented, and the proportion which\r\nthese irregularities bear to the force of the waves, combined with\r\nthe inequality of hardness in the rocks, prove, that the present\r\nline of the shore has been determined by the action of the sea. The\r\nnaked and precipitous cliffs which overhang the deep, the rocks\r\nhollowed, perforated, as they are farther advanced in the sea, and at\r\nlast insulated, lead to the same conclusion, and mark very clearly\r\nso many different stages of decay. It is true, we do not see the\r\nsuccessive steps of this progress exemplified in the states of the same\r\nindividual rock, but we see them clearly in different individuals;\r\nand the conviction thus produced, when the phenomena are sufficiently\r\nmultiplied and varied, is as irresistible, as if we saw the changes\r\nactually effected in the moment of observation.\r\n\r\nOn such shores, the fragments of rock once detached, become instruments\r\nof further destruction, and make a part of the powerful artillery with\r\nwhich the ocean assails the bulwarks of the land: they are impelled\r\nagainst the rocks, from which they break off other fragments, and the\r\nwhole are thus ground against one another; whatever be their hardness,\r\nthey are reduced to gravel, the smooth surface and round figure of\r\nwhich, are the most certain proofs of a _detritus_ which nothing can\r\nresist.\r\n\r\n98. Again, where the sea coast is flat, we have abundant evidence of\r\nthe degradation of the land in the beaches of sand and small gravel;\r\nthe sand banks and shoals that are continually changing; the alluvial\r\nland at the mouths of the rivers; the bars that seem to oppose their\r\ndischarge into the sea, and the shallowness of the sea itself. On\r\nsuch coasts, the land usually seems to gain upon the sea, whereas,\r\non shores of a bolder aspect, it is the sea that generally appears\r\nto gain upon the land. What the land acquires in extent, however, it\r\nloses in elevation; and, whether its surface increase or diminish, the\r\ndepredations made on it are in both cases evinced with equal certainty.\r\n\r\n99. If we proceed in our survey from the shores, inland, we meet\r\nat every step with the fullest evidence of the same truths, and\r\nparticularly in the nature and economy of rivers. Every river appears\r\nto consist of a main trunk, fed from a variety of branches, each\r\nrunning in a valley proportioned to its size, and all of them together\r\nforming a system of vallies, communicating with one another, and having\r\nsuch a nice adjustment of their declivities, that none of them join the\r\nprincipal valley, either on too high or too low a level; a circumstance\r\nwhich would be infinitely improbable, if each of these vallies were not\r\nthe work of the stream that flows in it.\r\n\r\nIf indeed a river consisted of a single stream, without branches,\r\nrunning in a straight valley, it might be supposed that some great\r\nconcussion, or some powerful torrent, had opened at once the channel\r\nby which its waters are conducted to the ocean; but, when the usual\r\nform of a river is considered, the trunk divided into many branches,\r\nwhich rise at a great distance from one another, and these again\r\nsubdivided into an infinity of smaller ramifications, it becomes\r\nstrongly impressed upon the mind, that all these channels have been cut\r\nby the waters themselves; that they have been slowly dug out by the\r\nwashing and erosion of the land; and that it is by the repeated touches\r\nof the same instrument, that this curious assemblage of lines has been\r\nengraved so deeply on the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n100. The changes which have taken place in the courses of rivers, are\r\nalso to be traced, in many instances, by successive platforms, of flat\r\nalluvial land, rising one above another, and marking the different\r\nlevels on which the river has run at different periods of time. Of\r\nthese, the number to be distinguished, in some instances, is not less\r\nthan four, or even five; and this necessarily carries us back, like\r\nall the operations we are now treating of, to an antiquity extremely\r\nremote: for, if it be considered, that each change which the river\r\nmakes in its bed, obliterates at least a part of the monuments of\r\nformer changes, we shall be convinced, that only a small part of the\r\nprogression can leave any distinct memorial behind it, and that there\r\nis no reason to think, that, in the part which we see, the beginning is\r\nincluded.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: NOTE XVI.]\r\n\r\n101. In the same manner, when a river undermines its banks, it often\r\ndiscovers deposits of sand and gravel, that have been made when it ran\r\non a higher level than it does at present. In other instances, the same\r\nstrata are seen on both the banks, though the bed of the river is now\r\nsunk deep between them, and perhaps holds as winding a course through\r\nthe solid rock, as if it flowed along the surface; a proof that it must\r\nhave begun to sink its bed, when it ran through such loose materials as\r\nopposed but a very inconsiderable resistance to its stream. A river, of\r\nwhich the course is both serpentine and deeply excavated in the rock,\r\nis among the phenomena, by which the slow waste of the land, and also\r\nthe cause of that waste, are most directly pointed out.\r\n\r\n102. It is, however, where rivers issue through narrow defiles among\r\nmountains, that the identity of the strata on both sides is most easily\r\nrecognised, and remarked at the same time with the greatest wonder. On\r\nobserving the Potowmack, where it penetrates the ridge of the Allegany\r\nmountains, or the Irtish, as it issues from the defiles of Altai,\r\nthere is no man, however little addicted to geological speculations,\r\nwho does not immediately acknowledge, that the mountain was once\r\ncontinued quite across the space in which the river now flows; and, if\r\nhe ventures to reason concerning the cause of so wonderful a change,\r\nhe ascribes it to some great convulsion of nature, which has torn the\r\nmountain asunder, and opened a passage for the waters. It is only the\r\nphilosopher, who has deeply meditated on the effects which action long\r\ncontinued is able to produce, and on the simplicity of the means which\r\nnature employs in all her operations, who sees in this nothing but the\r\ngradual working of a stream, that once flowed over the top of the ridge\r\nwhich it now so deeply intersects, and has cut its course through the\r\nrock, in the same way, and almost with the same instrument, by which\r\nthe lapidary divides a block of marble or granite.\r\n\r\n103. It is highly interesting to trace up, in this manner, the action\r\nof causes with which we are familiar, to the production of effects,\r\nwhich at first seem to require the introduction of unknown and\r\nextraordinary powers; and it is no less interesting to observe, how\r\nskilfully nature has balanced the action of all the minute causes of\r\nwaste, and rendered them conducive to the general good. Of this we\r\nhave a most remarkable instance, in the provision made for preserving\r\nthe soil, or the coat of vegetable mould, spread out over the surface\r\nof the earth. This coat, as it consists of loose materials, is easily\r\nwashed away by the rains, and is continually carried down by the rivers\r\ninto the sea. This effect is visible to every one; the earth is removed\r\nnot only in the form of sand and gravel, but its finer particles\r\nsuspended in the waters, tinge those of some rivers continually, and\r\nthose of all occasionally, that is, when they are flooded or swollen\r\nwith rains. The quantity of earth thus carried down, varies according\r\nto circumstances; it has been computed, in some instances, that the\r\nwater of a river in a flood, contains earthy matter suspended in it,\r\namounting to more than the two hundred and fiftieth part of its own\r\nbulk.[30] The soil, therefore, is continually diminished, its parts\r\nbeing transported from higher to lower levels, and finally delivered\r\ninto the sea. But it is a fact, that the soil, notwithstanding, remains\r\nthe same in quantity, or at least nearly the same, and must have done\r\nso, ever since the earth was the receptacle of animal or vegetable\r\nlife. The soil, therefore, is augmented from other causes, just as\r\nmuch, at an average, as it is diminished by that now mentioned; and\r\nthis augmentation evidently can proceed from nothing but the constant\r\nand slow disintegration of the rocks. In the permanence, therefore,\r\nof a coat of vegetable mould on the surface of the earth, we have a\r\ndemonstrative proof of the continual destruction of the rocks; and\r\ncannot but admire the skill, with which the powers of the many chemical\r\nand mechanical agents employed in this complicated work, are so\r\nadjusted, as to make the supply and the waste of the soil exactly equal\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: See Lehman, Traités de Phys. &c. tom. iii. p. 359. Note.]\r\n\r\n104. Before we take leave of the rivers and the plains, we must remark\r\nanother fact, often observed in the natural history of the latter, and\r\nclearly evincing the former existence of immense bodies of strata, in\r\nsituations from which they have now entirely disappeared. The fact here\r\nalluded to is, the great quantity of round and hard gravel, often to be\r\nmet with in the soil, under such circumstances, as prove, that it can\r\nonly have come from the decomposition of rocks, that once occupied the\r\nvery ground over which this gravel is now spread. In the chalk country,\r\nfor instance, about London, the quantity of flints in the soil is every\r\nwhere great; and, in particular situations, nothing but flinty gravel\r\nis found to a considerable depth. Now, the source from which these\r\nflints are derived is quite evident, for they are precisely the same\r\nwith those contained in the chalk beds, wherever these last are found\r\nundisturbed, and from the destruction of such beds they have no doubt\r\noriginated. Hence a great thickness of chalk must have been decomposed,\r\nto yield the quantity of flints now in the soil of these countries; for\r\nthe flints are but thinly scattered through the native chalk, compared\r\nwith their abundance in the loose earth. To afford, for example, such\r\na body of flinty gravel as is found about Kensington, what an enormous\r\nquantity of chalk rock must have been destroyed?\r\n\r\n105. This argument, which Dr Hutton has applied particularly to the\r\nchalk countries, may be extended to many others. The great plain of\r\nCrau, near the mouth of the Rhone, is well known, and was regarded\r\nwith wonder, even in ages when the natural history of the globe was\r\nnot an object of much attention. The immense quantity of large round\r\ngravel-stones, with which this extensive plain is entirely covered,\r\nhas been supposed, by some mineralogists, to have been brought down\r\nby the Durance, and other torrents, from the Alps; but, on further\r\nexamination, has been found to be of the same kind that is contained\r\nin certain horizontal layers of pudding-stone, which are the basis of\r\nthe whole plain. It cannot be doubted, therefore, that the vast body of\r\ngravel spread over it, has originated from the destruction of layers\r\nof the same rock, which may perhaps have risen to a great height above\r\nwhat is now the surface. Indeed, from knowing the depth of the gravel\r\nthat covers the plain, and the average quantity of the like gravel\r\ncontained in a given thickness of rock, one might estimate how much of\r\nthe latter has been actually worn away. Whether data precise enough\r\ncould be found, to give any weight to such a computation, must be left\r\nfer future inquiry to determine.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: NOTE XVII.]\r\n\r\n106. In these instances, chalk and pudding-stone, by containing in\r\nthem parts infinitely less destructible than their general mass, have,\r\nafter they are worn away, left behind them very unequivocal marks of\r\ntheir existence. The same has happened in the case of mineral veins,\r\nwhere the substances least subject to dissolution have remained,\r\nand are scattered at a great distance from their native place. Thus\r\ngold, the least liable to decomposition of all the metals, is very\r\ngenerally diffused through the earth, and is found, in a greater or\r\nless abundance, in the sand of almost all rivers. But the native place\r\nof this mineral is the solid rock, or the veins and cavities contained\r\nin the rock, and from thence it must have made its way into the soil.\r\nThis, therefore, is another proof of the vast extent to which the\r\ndegradation of the land, and of the rock, which is the basis of it,\r\nhas been earned; and consequently, of the great difference between\r\nthe elevation and shape of the earth's surface in the present, and in\r\nformer ages.\r\n\r\n107. The veins of tin furnish an argument of the same kind. The\r\nores of this metal are very indestructible, and little subject to\r\ndecomposition, so that they remain very long in the ground without\r\nchange. Where there are tin veins, as in Cornwall, the tin-stone or tin\r\nore is found in great abundance in such vallies and streams as have\r\nthe same direction with the veins; and hence the _streaming_, as it is\r\ncalled, or washing of the earth, to obtain the tin-stone from it. Now,\r\nif it be considered, that none of this ore can have come into the soil\r\nbut from parts of a vein actually destroyed, it must appear evident\r\nthat a great waste of these veins has taken place, and consequently of\r\nthe schistus or granite in which they are contained.\r\n\r\n108. These lessons, which the geologist is taught in flat and open\r\ncountries, become more striking, by the study of those Alpine tracts,\r\nwhere the surface of the earth attains its greatest elevation. If we\r\nsuppose him placed for the first time in the midst of such a scene,\r\nas soon as he has recovered from the impression made by the novelty\r\nand magnificence of the spectacle before him, he begins to discover\r\nthe footsteps of time, and to perceive, that the works of nature,\r\nusually deemed the most permanent, are those on which the characters\r\nof vicissitude are most deeply imprinted. He sees himself in the midst\r\nof a vast ruin, where the precipices which rise on all sides with\r\nsuch boldness and asperity, the sharp peaks of the granite mountains,\r\nand the huge fragments that surround their bases, do but mark so many\r\nepochs in the progress of decay, and point out the energy of those\r\ndestructive causes, which even the magnitude and solidity of such great\r\nbodies have been unable to resist.\r\n\r\n109. The result of a more minute investigation, is in perfect unison\r\nwith this general impression. Whence is it, that the elevation\r\nof mountains is so obviously connected with the hardness and\r\nindestructibility of the rocks which compose them? Why is it, that a\r\nlofty mountain of soft and secondary rock is no where to be found; and\r\nthat such chains, as the Pyrenees or the Alps, never consist of any\r\nbut the hardest stone, of granite for instance, or of those primary\r\nstrata, which, if we are to credit the preceding theory, have been\r\ntwice heated in the fires, and twice tempered in the waters, of the\r\nmineral regions? Is it not plain that this arises, not from any direct\r\nconnection between the hardness of stones, and their height in the\r\natmosphere, but from this, that the waste and _detritus_ to which all\r\nthings are subject, will not allow soft and weak substances to remain\r\nlong in an exposed and elevated situation? Were it not for this, the\r\nsecondary rocks, being in position superincumbent on the primary, ought\r\nto be the highest of the two, and should cover the primary, (as they\r\nno doubt have at one time done,) in the highest as well as the lowest\r\nsituations, or among the mountains as well as in the plains.\r\n\r\n110. Again, wherefore is it, that among all mountains, remarkable for\r\ntheir ruggedness and asperity, the rock, on examination, is always\r\nfound of very unequal destructibility, some parts yielding to the\r\nweather, and to the other causes of disintegration, much more slowly\r\nthan the rest, and having strength sufficient to support themselves,\r\nwhen left alone, in slender pyramids, bold projections, and overhanging\r\ncliffs? Where, on the other hand, the rock wastes uniformly, the\r\nmountains are similar to one another; their swells and slopes are\r\ngentle, and they are bounded by a waving and continuous surface. The\r\nintermediate degrees of resistance which the rocks oppose to the causes\r\nof destruction, produce intermediate forms. It is this which gives to\r\nthe mountains, of every different species of rock, a different habit\r\nand expression, and which, in particular, has imparted to those of\r\ngranite that venerable and majestic character, by which they rarely\r\nfail to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n111. The structure of the vallies among mountains, shows clearly to\r\nwhat cause their existence is to be ascribed. Here we have first a\r\nlarge valley, communicating directly with the plain, and winding\r\nbetween high ridges of mountains, while the river in the bottom of it\r\ndescends over a surface, remarkable, in such a scene, for its uniform\r\ndeclivity. Into this, open a multitude of transverse or secondary\r\nvallies, intersecting the ridges on either side of the former, each\r\nbringing a contribution to the main stream, proportioned to its\r\nmagnitude; and, except where a cataract now and then intervenes,\r\nall having that nice adjustment in their levels, (99.) which is the\r\nmore wonderful, the greater the irregularity of the surface. These\r\nsecondary vallies have others of a smaller size opening into them;\r\nand, among mountains of the first order, where all is laid out on the\r\ngreatest scale, these ramifications are continued to a fourth, and\r\neven a fifth, each diminishing in size as it increases in elevation,\r\nand as its supply of water is less. Through them all, this law is in\r\ngeneral observed, that where a higher valley joins a lower one, of the\r\ntwo angles which it makes with the latter, that which is obtuse is\r\nalways on the descending side; a law that is the same with that which\r\nregulates the confluence of streams running on a surface nearly of\r\nuniform inclination. This alone is a proof that the vallies are the\r\nwork of the streams; and indeed what else but the water itself, working\r\nits way through obstacles of unequal resistance, could have opened or\r\nkept up a communication between the inequalities of an irregular and\r\nalpine surface?\r\n\r\n112. Many more arguments, all leading to the same conclusion, may\r\nbe deduced from the general facts, known in the natural history of\r\nmountains; and, if the Oreologist would trace back the progress of\r\nwaste, till he come in sight of that original structure, of which\r\nthe remains are still so vast, he perceives an immense mass of solid\r\nrock, naked and unshapely, as it first emerged from the deep, and\r\nincomparably greater than all that is now before him. The operation\r\nof rains and torrents, modified by the hardness and tenacity of the\r\nrock, has worked the whole into its present form; has hollowed out\r\nthe vallies, and gradually detached the mountains from the general\r\nmass, cutting down their sides into steep precipices at one place,\r\nand smoothing them into gentle declivities at another. From this has\r\nresulted a transportation of materials, which, both for the quantity\r\nof the whole, and the magnitude of the individual fragments, must seem\r\nincredible to every one, who has not learned to calculate the effects\r\nof continued action, and to reflect, that length of time can convert\r\naccidental into steady causes. Hence fragments of rock, from the\r\ncentral chain, are found to have travelled into distant vallies, even\r\nwhere many inferior ridges intervene: hence the granite of Mont Blanc\r\nis seen in the plains of Lombardy, or on the sides of Jura; and the\r\nruins of the Carpathian mountains lie scattered over the shores of the\r\nBaltic.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: NOTE XVIII.]\r\n\r\n113. Thus, with Dr Hutton, we shall be disposed to consider those great\r\nchains of mountains, which traverse the surface of the globe, as cut\r\nout of masses vastly greater, and more lofty than any thing that now\r\nremains. The present appearances afford no data for calculating the\r\noriginal magnitude of these masses, or the height to which they may\r\nhave been elevated. The nearest estimate we can form is, where a chain\r\nor group of mountains, like those of Rosa in the Alps, is horizontally\r\nstratified, and where, of consequence, the undisturbed position of the\r\nmineral beds enables us to refer the whole of the present inequalities\r\nof the surface to the operation of waste or decay. These mountains,\r\nas they now stand, may not inaptly be compared to the pillars of earth\r\nwhich workmen leave behind them, to afford a measure of the whole\r\nquantity of earth which they have removed. As the pillars, (considering\r\nthe mountains as such,) are in this case of less height than they\r\noriginally were, so the measure furnished by them is but a limit, which\r\nthe quantity sought must necessarily exceed.\r\n\r\n114. Such, according to Dr Hutton's theory, are the changes which the\r\ndaily operations of waste have produced on the surface of the globe.\r\nThese operations, inconsiderable if taken separately, become great, by\r\nconspiring all to the same end, never counteracting one another, but\r\nproceeding, through a period of indefinite extent, continually in the\r\nsame direction. Thus every thing descends, nothing returns upward; the\r\nhard and solid bodies every where dissolve, and the loose and soft no\r\nwhere consolidate. The powers which tend to preserve, and those which\r\ntend to change the condition of the earth's surface, are never _in\r\nequilibrio_; the latter are, in all cases, the most powerful, and, in\r\nrespect of the former, are like living in comparison of dead forces.\r\nHence the law of decay is one which suffers no exception: The elements\r\nof all bodies were once loose and unconnected, and to the same state\r\nnature has appointed that they should all return.\r\n\r\n115. It affords no presumption against the reality of this progress,\r\nthat, in respect of man, it is too slow to be immediately perceived:\r\nThe utmost portion of it to which our experience can extend, is\r\nevanescent, in comparison with the whole, and must be regarded as the\r\nmomentary increment of a vast progression, circumscribed by no other\r\nlimits than the duration of the world. TIME performs the office of\r\nintegrating the infinitesimal parts of which this progression is made\r\nup; it collects them into one sum, and produces from them an amount\r\ngreater than any that can be assigned.\r\n\r\n116. While on the surface of the earth so much is every where going to\r\ndecay, no new production of mineral substances is found in any region\r\naccessible to man. The instances of what are called petrifactions, or\r\nthe formation of stony substances by means of water, which we sometimes\r\nobserve, whether they be ferruginous concretions, or calcareous, or,\r\nas happens in some rare cases, siliceous stalactites, are too few\r\nin number, and too inconsiderable in extent, to be deemed material\r\nexceptions to this general rule. The bodies thus generated, also, are\r\nno sooner formed, than they become subject to waste and dissolution,\r\nlike all the other hard substances in nature; so that they but retard\r\nfor a while the progress by which they are all resolved into dust, and\r\nsooner or later committed to the bosom of the deep.\r\n\r\n117. We are not, however, to imagine, that there is no where any means\r\nof repairing this waste; for, on comparing the conclusion at which\r\nwe are now arrived, viz. that the present continents are all going\r\nto decay, and their materials descending into the ocean, with the\r\nproposition first laid down, that these same continents are composed\r\nof materials which must have been collected from the decay of former\r\nrocks, it is impossible not to recognise two corresponding steps of\r\nthe same progress; of a progress, by which mineral substances are\r\nsubjected to the same series of changes, and alternately wasted away\r\nand renovated. In the same manner, as the present mineral substances\r\nderive their origin from substances similar to themselves; so, from the\r\nland now going to decay, the sand and gravel forming on the sea shore,\r\nor in the beds of rivers; from the shells and corals, which in such\r\nenormous quantities are every day accumulated in the bosom of the sea;\r\nfrom the drift wood, and the multitude of vegetable and animal remains\r\ncontinually deposited in the ocean: from all these we cannot doubt,\r\nthat strata are now forming in those regions, to which nature seems\r\nto have confined the powers of mineral reproduction; from which, after\r\nbeing consolidated, they are again destined to emerge, and to exhibit a\r\nseries of changes similar to the past.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: NOTE XIX.]\r\n\r\n118. How often these vicissitudes of decay and renovation have been\r\nrepeated, is not for us to determine: they constitute a series, of\r\nwhich, as the author of this theory has remarked, we neither see the\r\nbeginning nor the end; a circumstance that accords well with what\r\nis known concerning other parts of the economy of the world. In the\r\ncontinuation of the different species of animals and vegetables that\r\ninhabit the earth, we discern neither a beginning nor an end; and,\r\nin the planetary motions, where geometry has carried the eye so far\r\nboth into the future and the past, we discover no mark, either of\r\nthe commencement or the termination of the present order.[34] It is\r\nunreasonable, indeed, to suppose, that such marks should any where\r\nexist. The Author of nature has not given laws to the universe, which,\r\nlike the institutions of men, carry in themselves the elements of their\r\nown destruction. He has not permitted, in his works, any symptom of\r\ninfancy or of old age, or any sign by which we may estimate either\r\ntheir fixture or their past duration. He may put an end, as be no doubt\r\ngave a beginning, to the present system, at some determinate period;\r\nbut we may safely conclude, that this great _catastrophe_ will not\r\nbe brought about by any of the laws now existing, and that it is not\r\nindicated by any thing which we perceive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: NOTE XX.]\r\n\r\n119. To assert, therefore, that, in the economy of the world, we see\r\nno mark, either of a beginning or an end, is very different from\r\naffirming, that the world had no beginning, and will have no end. The\r\nfirst is a conclusion justified by common sense, as well as sound\r\nphilosophy; while the second is a presumptuous and unwarrantable\r\nassertion, for which no reason from experience or analogy can ever be\r\nassigned. Dr Hutton might, therefore, justly complain of the uncandid\r\ncriticism, which, by substituting the one of these assertions for the\r\nother, endeavoured to load his theory with the reproach of atheism and\r\nimpiety. Mr KIRWAN, in bringing forward this harsh and ill-founded\r\ncensure, was neither animated by the spirit, nor guided by the maxims\r\nof true philosophy. By the spirit of philosophy, he must have been\r\ninduced to reflect, that such poisoned weapons as he was preparing\r\nto use, are hardly ever allowable in scientific contest, as having\r\na less direct tendency to overthrow the system, than to hurt the\r\nperson of an adversary, and to wound, perhaps incurably, his mind, his\r\nreputation, or his peace. By the maxims of philosophy, he must have\r\nbeen reminded, that, in no part of the history of nature, has any mark\r\nbeen discovered, either of the beginning or the end of the present\r\n_order_; and that the geologist sadly mistakes, both the object of his\r\nscience and the limits of his understanding, who thinks it his business\r\nto explain the means employed by INFINITE WISDOM for establishing the\r\nlaws which now govern the world.\r\n\r\nBy attending to these obvious considerations, Mr Kirwan would have\r\navoided a very illiberal and ungenerous proceeding; and, however he\r\nmight have differed from Dr Hutton as to the _truth_ of his opinions,\r\nhe would not have censured their _tendency_ with such rash and\r\nunjustifiable severity.\r\n\r\nBut, if this author may be blamed for wanting the temper, or neglecting\r\nthe rules, of philosophic investigation, he is hardly less culpable,\r\nfor having so slightly considered the scope and spirit of a work which\r\nhe condemned so freely. In that work, instead of finding the world\r\nrepresented as the result of necessity or chance, which might be looked\r\nfor, if the accusations of atheism or impiety were well founded, we\r\nsee every where the utmost attention to discover, and the utmost\r\ndisposition to admire, the instances of wise and beneficent design\r\nmanifested in the structure, or economy of the world. The enlarged\r\nviews of these, which his geological system afforded, appeared to Dr\r\nHutton himself as its most valuable result. They were the parts of it\r\nwhich he contemplated with greatest delight; and he would have been\r\nless flattered, by being told of the ingenuity and originality of his\r\ntheory, than of the addition which it had made to our knowledge of\r\n_final causes_. It was natural, therefore, that he should be hurt by\r\nan attempt to accuse him of opinions, so different from those which he\r\nhad always taught; and if he answered Mr Kirwan's attack with warmth or\r\nasperity, we must ascribe it to the indignation excited by unmerited\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n120. But to return to the natural history of the earth: Though there be\r\nin it no _data_, from which the commencement of the present order can\r\nbe ascertained, there are many by which the existence of that order may\r\nbe traced back to an antiquity extremely remote. The beds of primitive\r\nschistus, for instance, contain sand, gravel, and other materials,\r\ncollected, as already shown, from the dissolution of mineral bodies;\r\nwhich bodies, therefore, must have existed long before the oldest part\r\nof the present land was formed. Again, in this gravel we sometimes find\r\npieces of sandstone, and of other compound rocks, by which we are of\r\ncourse carried back a step farther, so as to reach a system of things,\r\nfrom which the present is the third in succession; and this may be\r\nconsidered as the most ancient epocha, of which any memorial exists in\r\nthe records of the fossil kingdom.\r\n\r\n121. Next in the order of time to the consolidation of the primary\r\nstrata, we must place their elevation, when, from being horizontal, and\r\nat the bottom of the sea, they were broken, set on edge, and raised to\r\nthe surface. It is even probable, as formerly observed, that to this\r\nsucceeded a depression of the same strata, and a second elevation,\r\nso that they have twice visited the superior, and twice the inferior\r\nregions. During the second immersion, were formed, first, the great\r\nbodies of pudding-stone, that in so many instances lie immediately\r\nabove them; and next were deposited the strata that are strictly\r\ndenominated secondary.\r\n\r\n122. The third great event, was the raising up of this compound body of\r\nold and new strata from the bottom of the sea, and forming it into the\r\ndry land, or the continents, as they now exist.[35] Contemporary with\r\nthis, we must suppose the injection of melted matter among the strata,\r\nand the consequent formation of the crystallized and unstratified\r\nrocks, namely, the granite, metallic veins, and veins of porphyry and\r\nwhinstone. This, however, is to be considered as embracing a period\r\nof great duration; and it must always be recollected, that veins are\r\nfound of very different formation; so that when we speak generally, it\r\nis perhaps impossible to state any thing more precise concerning their\r\nantiquity, than that they are posterior to the strata, and that the\r\nveins of whinstone seem to be the most recent of all, as they traverse\r\nevery other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: NOTE XXI.]\r\n\r\n123. In the fourth place, with respect to time, we must class the\r\nfacts that regard the detritus and waste of the land, and must\r\ncarefully distinguish them from the more ancient phenomena of the\r\nmineral kingdom. Here we are to reckon the shaping of all the present\r\ninequalities of the surface; the formation of hills of gravel, and\r\nof what have been called tertiary strata, consisting of loose and\r\nunconsolidated materials; also collections of shells not mineralised,\r\nlike those in Turaine; such petrifactions as those contained in the\r\nrock of Gibraltar, on the coast of Dalmatia, and in the caves of\r\nBayreuth. The bones of land animals found in the soil, such as those\r\nof Siberia, or North America, are probably more recent than any of the\r\nformer.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: NOTE XXII.]\r\n\r\n124. These phenomena, then, are all so many marks of the lapse of\r\ntime, among which the principles of geology enable us to distinguish\r\na certain order, so that we know some of them to be more, and others\r\nto be less distant, but without being able to ascertain, with any\r\nexactness, the proportion of the immense intervals which separate them.\r\nThese intervals admit of no comparison with the astronomical measures\r\nof time; they cannot be expressed by the revolutions of the sun or of\r\nthe moon; nor is there any synchronism between the most recent epoch as\r\nof the mineral kingdom, and the most ancient of our ordinary chronology.\r\n\r\n125. On what is now said is grounded another objection to Dr Hutton's\r\ntheory, namely, that the high antiquity ascribed by it to the earth,\r\nis inconsistent with that system of chronology which rests on the\r\nauthority of the Sacred Writings. This objection would no doubt be of\r\nweight, if the high antiquity in question were not restricted merely to\r\nthe globe of the earth, but were also extended to the human race. That\r\nthe origin of mankind does not go back beyond six or seven thousand\r\nyears, is a position so involved in the narrative of the Mosaic books,\r\nthat any thing inconsistent with it, would no doubt stand in opposition\r\nto the testimony of those ancient records. On this subject, however,\r\ngeology is silent; and the history of arts and sciences, when traced\r\nas high as any authentic monuments extend, refers the beginnings of\r\ncivilization to a date not very different from that which has just been\r\nmentioned, and infinitely within the limits of the most recent of the\r\nepoch as, marked by the physical revolutions of the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the authority of the Sacred Books seems to be but\r\nlittle interested in what regards the mere antiquity of the earth\r\nitself; nor does it appear that their language is to be understood\r\nliterally concerning the _age_ of that body, any more than concerning\r\nits _figure_ or its _motion_. The theory of Dr Hutton stands here\r\nprecisely on the same footing with the system of COPERNICUS; for\r\nthere is no reason to suppose, that it was the purpose of revelation\r\nto furnish a standard of geological, any more than of astronomical\r\nscience. It is admitted, on all hands, that the Scriptures are not\r\nintended to resolve physical questions, or to explain matters in no\r\nway related to the morality of human actions; and if, in consequence\r\nof this principle, a considerable latitude of interpretation were not\r\nallowed, we should continue at this moment to believe, that the earth\r\nis flat; that the sun moves round the earth; and that the circumference\r\nof a circle is no more than three times its diameter.\r\n\r\nIt is but reasonable, therefore, that we should extend to the\r\ngeologist the same liberty of speculation, which the astronomer and\r\nmathematician are already in possession of; and this may be done,\r\nby supposing that the chronology of MOSES relates only to the human\r\nrace. This liberty is not more necessary to Dr Hutton than to other\r\ntheorists. No ingenuity has been able to reconcile the natural history\r\nof the globe with the opinion of its recent origin; and accordingly\r\nthe cosmologies of Kirwan and De Luc, though contrived with more\r\nmineralogical skill, are not less forced and unsatisfactory than those\r\nof Burnet and Whiston.\r\n\r\n126. It is impossible to look back on the system which we have thus\r\nendeavoured to illustrate, without being struck with the novelty and\r\nbeauty of the views which it sets before us. The very plan and scope\r\nof it distinguish it from all other theories of the earth, and point\r\nit out as a work of great and original invention. The sole object of\r\nsuch theories has hitherto been, to explain the manner in which the\r\npresent laws of the mineral kingdom were first established, or began to\r\nexist, without treating of the manner in which they now proceed, and by\r\nwhich their continuance is provided for. The authors of these theories\r\nhave accordingly gone back to a state of things altogether unlike the\r\npresent, and have confined their reasonings, or their fictions, to a\r\ncrisis which never has existed but once, and which never can return.\r\nDr Hutton, on the other hand, has guided his investigation by the\r\nphilosophical maxim, _Causam naturalem et assiduam quærimus, non raram\r\net fortuitam_. His theory, accordingly, presents us with a system of\r\nwise and provident economy, where the same instruments are continually\r\nemployed, and where the decay and renovation of fossils being carried\r\non at the same time in the different regions allotted to them, preserve\r\nin the earth the conditions essential for the support of animal and\r\nvegetable life. We have been long accustomed to admire that beautiful\r\ncontrivance in nature, by which the water of the ocean, drawn up in\r\nvapour by the atmosphere, imparts, in its descent, fertility to the\r\nearth, and becomes the great cause of vegetation and of life; but now\r\nwe find, that this vapour not only fertilizes, but creates the soil;\r\nprepares it from the solid rock, and, after employing it in the great\r\noperations of the surface, carries it back into the regions where all\r\nits mineral characters are renewed. Thus, the circulation of moisture\r\nthrough the air, is a prime mover, not only in the annual succession\r\nof the seasons, but in the great geological cycle, by which the waste\r\nand reproduction of entire continents is circumscribed. Perhaps a more\r\nstriking view than this, of the wisdom that presides over nature, was\r\nnever presented by any philosophical system, nor a greater addition\r\never made to our knowledge of final causes. It is an addition which\r\ngives consistency to the rest, by proving, that equal foresight is\r\nexerted in providing for the whole and for the parts, and that no\r\nless a care is taken to maintain the constitution of the earth, than\r\nto preserve the tribes of animals and vegetables which dwell on its\r\nsurface. In a word, it is the peculiar excellence of this theory, that\r\nit ascribes to the phenomena of geology an order similar to that which\r\nexists in the provinces of nature with which we are best acquainted;\r\nthat it produces seas and continents, not by accident, but by the\r\noperation of regular and uniform causes; that it makes the decay of one\r\npart subservient to the restoration of another, and gives stability to\r\nthe whole, not by perpetuating individuals, but by reproducing them in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n127. Again, in the detail of this theory, and the ample induction on\r\nwhich it is founded, we meet with many facts and observations, either\r\nentirely new, or hitherto very imperfectly understood. Thus, the veins\r\nwhich proceed from masses of granite, and penetrate the incumbent\r\nschistus, had either escaped the observation of former mineralogists,\r\nor the importance of the phenomenon had been entirely overlooked. Dr\r\nHutton has described the appearances with great accuracy, and drawn\r\nfrom them the most interesting conclusions. At the junction of the\r\nprimary and secondary strata, the facts which he has noted had been\r\nobserved by others; but no one I think had so fully understood the\r\nlanguage which they speak, or had so clearly perceived the consequences\r\nthat necessarily follow from them. He is the first who distinctly\r\npointed out the characters which distinguish whinstone from lava, and\r\nwho explained the true relation that subsists between these substances.\r\nHe also discovered the induration of the strata, in contact with veins\r\nof whin, and the charring of the coal in their vicinity. His theory\r\nalso enabled him to determine the affinity of whinstone and granite\r\nto one another, and their relation to the other great bodies of the\r\nmineral kingdom.\r\n\r\nTo the observations of the same excellent geologist, we are indebted\r\nfor the knowledge of the general and important fact, that all the hard\r\nsubstances of the mineral kingdom, when elevated into the atmosphere,\r\nhave a tendency to decay, and are subject to a disintegration\r\nand waste, to which no limit can be set but that of their entire\r\ndestruction; that no provision is made on the surface for repairing\r\nthis waste, and that there, no new fossil is produced; that the\r\nformation of all the varied scenery which the surface of the earth\r\nexhibits, depends on the operation of causes, the momentary exertions\r\nof which are familiar to us, though we knew not before the effects\r\nwhich their accumulated action was able to produce. These are facts in\r\nthe natural history of the earth, the discovery of which is due to Dr\r\nHutton; and, should we lay all further speculation aside, and consider\r\nthe theory of the earth as a work too great to be attempted by man, we\r\nmust still regard the phenomena and laws just mentioned, as forming a\r\nsolid and valuable addition to our knowledge.\r\n\r\n128. If we would compare this theory with others, as to the invisible\r\nagents which it employs, we must consider, that fire and water are the\r\ntwo powers which all of them must make use of, so that they can differ\r\nfrom one another only by the way in which they combine these powers.\r\nIn Dr Hutton's system, water is first employed to deposit and arrange,\r\nand then fire to consolidate, mineralize, and lastly, to elevate\r\nthe strata; but with respect to the unstratified or crystallized\r\nsubstances, the action of fire only is recognised. The system having\r\nleast affinity to this is the Neptunian, which ascribes the formation\r\nof all minerals to the action of water alone, and extends this\r\nhypothesis even to the unstratified rocks. Here, therefore, the action\r\nof fire is entirely excluded; and the Neptunists have certainly made a\r\ngreat sacrifice to the love of truth, or of paradox, in rejecting the\r\nassistance of so powerful an auxiliary.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: NOTE XXIII.]\r\n\r\n129. In the systems which employ the agency of the latter element, we\r\nare to look for a greater resemblance to that of Dr Hutton, though\r\nmany and great marks of distinction are easily perceived. In the\r\ncosmologies, for example, of LEIBNITZ and BUFFON, fire and water are\r\nboth employed, as well as in this; but they are employed in a reverse\r\norder. These philosophers introduce the action of fire first, and\r\nthen the action of water, which is to invert the order of nature\r\naltogether, as the consolidation of the rocks must be posterior to\r\ntheir stratification. Indeed, the theory of Buffon is singularly\r\ndefective: besides inverting the order of the two great operations\r\nof stratification and consolidation, and of course giving no real\r\nexplanation of the latter, it gives no account of the elevation, or\r\nhighly inclined position of the strata; it makes no distinction between\r\nstratified and unstratified bodies, nor does it offer any but the most\r\nunsatisfactory explanation of the inequalities of the earth's surface.\r\nThis system, therefore, has but a very distant resemblance to the\r\nHuttonian theory.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: NOTE XXIV.]\r\n\r\n130. The system of LAZZARO MORO has been remarked as approaching nearer\r\nto this theory than any other; and it is certain, that one very\r\nimportant principle is common to them both. The theory of the Italian\r\ngeologist was chiefly directed to the explanation of the remains of\r\nmarine animals, which are found in mountains far from the sea; and it\r\nappears to have been suggested to him by the phenomena of the _Campi\r\nPhlegræi_, and by the production of the new island of _Santorini_\r\nin the Archipelago. He accordingly supposes, that the islands and\r\ncontinents have been all raised up, like the above-mentioned island,\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea, by the force of volcanic fire: that\r\nthese fires began to burn under the bottom of the ocean, soon after\r\nthe creation of the world, when as yet the ocean covered the whole\r\nearth: that they at first elevated a portion of the land; and in this\r\nprimitive land no shells are found, as the original ocean was destitute\r\nof fish. The volcanoes continuing to burn, under the sea, after the\r\ncreation of animated nature, the strata that were then raised up by\r\ntheir action were full of shells and other marine objects; and, from\r\nthe violence with which they were elevated, arose the contortions and\r\ninclined position which they frequently possess.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Dé Crostacei, et degli altri Marini Corpi, che si trovano\r\nsu' Monti: di Ant. Lazzaro Moro. Venezia. 1740.]\r\n\r\nThis system is imperfect, as it makes no peculiar provision for the\r\nconsolidation of the strata, which, according to it, as well as the\r\nNeptunian system, must be ascribed to the action, not of fire, but of\r\nwater. No account is given of the mineralization of the shells found\r\nin the strata, or of the difference between them and the shells found\r\nloose at the bottom of the sea; and no distinction is made between\r\nstratified and unstratified substances. But, with all this, Lazzaro\r\nMoro has certainly the merit of having perceived, that some other power\r\nthan that which deposited the strata, must have been employed for their\r\nelevation, and that they have endured the action of a disturbing force.\r\n\r\n131. From this comparison it appears, that Dr Hutton's theory is\r\nsufficiently distinct, even from the theories which approach to it most\r\nnearly, to merit, in the strictest sense, the appellation of _new_ and\r\n_original_. There are indeed few inventions or discoveries, recorded\r\nin the history of science, to which nearer approaches were not made\r\nbefore they were fully unfolded. It therefore very well deserves to be\r\ndistinguished by a particular name; and, if it behoves us to follow\r\nthe analogy observed in the names of the two great systems, which at\r\npresent divide the opinions of geologists, we may join Mr Kirwan in\r\ncalling this the PLUTONIC SYSTEM. For my own part, I would rather\r\nhave it characterized by a less splendid, but juster name, that of the\r\nHUTTONIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n132. The circumstance, however, which gives to this theory its\r\npeculiar character, and exalts it infinitely above all others, is\r\nthe introduction of the principle of pressure, to modify the effects\r\nof heat when applied at the bottom of the sea. This is in fact the\r\nkey to the grand enigma of the mineral kingdom, where, while one\r\nset of phenomena indicates the action of fire, another set, equally\r\nremarkable, seems to exclude the possibility of that action, by\r\npresenting us with mineral substances, in such a state as they could\r\nnever have been brought into by the operation of the fires we see at\r\nthe surface of the earth. These two classes of phenomena are reconciled\r\ntogether, by admitting the power of compression to confine the volatile\r\nparts of bodies when heat is applied to them, and to force them,\r\nin many instances, to undergo fusion, instead of being calcined or\r\ndissipated by burning or inflammation. In this hypothesis, which some\r\naffect to consider as a principle gratuitously assumed, there appears\r\nto me nothing but a very fair and legitimate generalization of the\r\nproperties of heat. Combustion and inflammation are chemical processes,\r\nto which other conditions are required, besides the presence of a high\r\ntemperature. The state of the mineral regions makes it reasonable\r\nto presume, that these conditions are wanting in the bowels of the\r\nearth, where, of consequence, we have a right to look for nothing but\r\nexpansion and fusion, the only operations which seem essential to\r\nheat, and inseparable from the application of it, in certain degrees,\r\nto certain substances. Though this principle, therefore, had no\r\ncountenance from analogy, the admirable simplicity, and the unity,\r\nwhich it introduces into the phenomena of geology, would sufficiently\r\njustify the application of it to the theory of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs another excellence of this theory, I may, perhaps, be allowed to\r\nremark, that it extends its consequences beyond those to which the\r\nauthor of it has himself adverted, and that it affords, which no\r\ngeological theory has yet done, a satisfactory explanation of the\r\nspheroidal figure of the earth.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: NOTE XXV.]\r\n\r\n133. Yet, with all these circumstances of originality, grandeur,\r\nand simplicity in its favour, with the addition of evidence as\r\ndemonstrative as the nature of the subject will admit, this theory\r\nhas probably many obstacles to overcome, before it meet the general\r\napprobation. The greatness of the objects which it sets before us,\r\nalarms the imagination; the powers which it supposes to be lodged\r\nin the subterraneous regions; a heat which has subdued the most\r\nrefractory rocks, and has melted beds of marble and quartz; an\r\nexpansive force, which has folded up, or broken the strata, and raised\r\nwhole continents from the bottom of the sea; these are things with\r\nwhich, however certainly they may be proved, the mind cannot soon\r\nbe familiarized. The change and movement also, which this theory\r\nascribes to all that the senses declare to be most unalterable, raise\r\nup against it the same prejudices which formerly opposed the belief\r\nin the true system of the world; and it affords a curious proof, how\r\nlittle such prejudices are subject to vary, that as Aristarchus, an\r\nancient follower of that system, was charged with impiety for moving\r\nthe everlasting Vesta from her place, so Dr Hutton, nearly on the same\r\nground, has been subjected to the very same accusation. Even the length\r\nof time which this theory regards as necessary to the revolutions of\r\nthe globe, is looked on as belonging to the marvellous; and man, who\r\nfinds himself constrained by the want of time, or of space, in almost\r\nall his undertakings, forgets, that in these, if in any thing, the\r\nriches of nature reject all limitation.[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: NOTE XXVI.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence which must be opposed to all these causes of incredulity,\r\ncannot be fully understood without much study and attention. It\r\nrequires not only a careful examination of particular instances, but\r\ncomprehensive views of the whole phenomena of geology; the comparison\r\nof things very remote with one another; the interpretation of the\r\n_obscure_ by the _luminous_, and of the _doubtful_ by the _decisive_\r\nappearances. The geologist must not content himself with examining\r\nthe insulated specimens of his cabinet, or with pursuing the nice\r\nsubtleties of mineralogical arrangement; he must study the relations of\r\nfossils, as they actually exist; he must follow nature into her wildest\r\nand most inaccessible abodes; and must select, for the places of his\r\nobservations, those points, from which the variety and gradation of her\r\nworks can be most extensively and accurately explored. Without such an\r\nexact and comprehensive survey, his mind will hardly be prepared to\r\nrelish the true theory of the earth. \"_Naturæ enim vis atque majestas\r\nomnibus momentis fide caret, si quis modo partes atque non totam\r\ncomplectatur animo_\".[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: PLIN. Hist. Nat. lib. vii. Cap. i.]\r\n\r\n134. If indeed this theory of the earth is as well founded as we\r\nsuppose it to be, the lapse of time must necessarily remove all\r\nobjections to it, and the progress of science will only develope its\r\nevidence more fully. As it stands at present, though true, it must be\r\nstill imperfect; and it cannot be doubted, that the great principles\r\nof it, though established on an immoveable basis, must yet undergo\r\nmany modifications, requiring to be limited, in one place, or to be\r\nextended, in another. A work of such variety and extent cannot be\r\ncarried to perfection by the efforts of an individual. Ages may be\r\nrequired to fill up the bold outline which Dr Hutton has traced with so\r\nmasterly a hand; to detach the parts more completely from the general\r\nmass; to adjust the size and position of the subordinate members; and\r\nto give to the whole piece the exact proportion and true colouring of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThis, however, in length of time, may be expected from the advancement\r\nof science, and from the mutual assistance which parts of knowledge,\r\nseemingly the most remote, often afford to one another. Not only\r\nmay the observations of the mineralogist, in tracts yet unexplored,\r\ncomplete the enumeration of geological facts; and the experiments of\r\nthe chemist, on substances not yet subjected to his analysis, afford a\r\nmore intimate acquaintance with the nature of fossils, and a measure\r\nof the power of those chemical agents to which this theory ascribes\r\nsuch vast effects: but also, from other sciences, less directly\r\nconnected with the natural history of the earth, much information may\r\nbe received. The accurate geographical maps and surveys which are now\r\nmaking; the foundings; the obsevations of currents; the barometrical\r\nmeasurements, may all combine to ascertain the reality, and to fix the\r\nquantity of those changes which terrestrial bodies continually undergo.\r\nEvery new improvement in science affords the means of delineating more\r\naccurately the face of nature as it now exists, and of transmitting, to\r\nfuture ages, an account, which may be compared with the face of nature\r\nas it shall then exist. If, therefore, the science of the present times\r\nis destined to survive the physical revolutions of the globe, the\r\nHUTTONIAN THEORY may be confirmed by historical record; and the author\r\nof it will be remembered among the illustrious few, whose systems\r\nhave been verified by the observations of succeeding ages, supported\r\nby facts unknown to themselves, and established by the decisions of a\r\ntribunal, slow, but infallible, in distinguishing between truth and\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ====================================\r\n\r\n                         NOTES AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n                 ====================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NOTES AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE I. § 2.\r\n\r\n                     _Origin of calcareous rocks._\r\n\r\n\r\n135. IT has been asserted, that Dr Hutton went farther than is stated\r\nat § 2, and maintained all calcareous matter to be _originally_ of\r\nanimal formation. This position, however, is so far from being laid\r\ndown by Dr Hutton, that it belongs to an inquiry which he carefully\r\navoided to enter on, as being altogether beyond the limits of\r\nphilosophical investigation.\r\n\r\nHe has indeed no where treated of the _first origin_ of any of the\r\nearths, or of any substance whatsoever, but only of the transformations\r\nwhich bodies have undergone since the present laws of nature were\r\nestablished. He considered this last as all that a science, built on\r\nexperiment and observation, can possibly extend to; and willingly left,\r\nto more presumptuous inquirers, the task of carrying their reasonings\r\nbeyond the boundaries of nature, and of unfolding the properties of\r\nthe chaotic fluid, with as much minuteness of detail, as if they were\r\ndescribing the circumstances of a chemical process which they had\r\nactually witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe idea of calcareous matter which really belongs to the Huttonian\r\nTheory, is, that in all the changes which the terraqueous globe has\r\nundergone in past ages, this matter existed, as it does now, either\r\nin the form of limestone and marble, or in the composition of other\r\nstones, or in the state of corals, shells, and bones of animals. It may\r\nbe true, that there is no particle of calcareous matter, at present\r\nexisting on the surface of the earth, that has not, at some time, made\r\na part of an animal body; but of this we can have no certainty, nor is\r\nit of any importance that we should. It is enough to know, that the\r\nrocks of marble and limestone contain in general marks of having been\r\nformed from materials collected at the bottom of the sea; and of this\r\na single cockle-shell, or piece of coral, found included in a rock, is\r\na sufficient proof with respect to the whole mass of which it makes a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe principal object which Dr Hutton had in view when he spoke of the\r\nmasses of marble and limestone, as composed of the calcareous matter\r\nof marine bodies,[43] was to prove, that they had been all formed\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and from materials there deposited. His\r\ngeneral conclusion is, \"That all the strata of the earth, not only\r\nthose consisting of such calcareous masses, but others superincumbent\r\nupon these, have had their origin at the bottom of the sea, by the\r\ncollection of sand and gravel, of shells, of coralline and crustaceous\r\nbodies, and of earths and clays variously mixed, or separated and\r\naccumulated. This is a general conclusion, well authenticated by the\r\nappearances of nature, and highly important in the natural history of\r\nthe earth.\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 23, 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 26.]\r\n\r\n136. In his Geological Essays, Mr Kirwan says, that \"some geologists,\r\nas Buffon, and of late Dr Hutton, have excluded calcareous earth from\r\nthe number of the primeval, asserting the masses of it we at present\r\nbehold to proceed from shell-fish. But, in addition to the unfounded\r\nsupposition, that shell-fish, or any animals, possess the power of\r\nproducing any simple earth, these philosophers should have considered,\r\nthat, before the existence of any fish, the stony masses that inclose\r\nthe bason of the sea, must have existed; and, among these, there is\r\nnone in which calcareous earth is not found. Dr Hutton endeavours to\r\n_evade_ this argument, by supposing the world we now inhabit to have\r\narisen from the ruins and fragments of an anterior, without pointing\r\nat any original. If we are thus to proceed _in infinitum_, I shall not\r\npretend to follow him; but, if he stops any where, he will find the\r\nsame argument equally to occur.\"[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Geol. Essays, p. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe argument here employed would certainly be conclusive against any\r\none, who, in disputing about the _first origin_ of things, should deny\r\nthat the calcareous is as ancient as any other of the simple earths.\r\nBut this has nothing to do with Dr Hutton's speculations, which, as has\r\nbeen just said, never extended to the _first origin_ of substances,\r\nbut were confined entirely to their changes; so that what he asserts\r\nconcerning the calcareous rocks, is no more than that those which we\r\nnow see have been formed from loose materials, deposited at the bottom\r\nof the sea. It was not therefore in order to _evade_ Mr Kirwan's\r\nargument, as the preceding passage would lead us to believe, that he\r\nsupposed the world which we now inhabit to have arisen from the ruin\r\nand waste of an anterior world; but it was because this seemed to him\r\na conclusion which necessarily followed from the phenomena of geology,\r\nand it was a conclusion that he had deduced long before he heard of Mr\r\nKirwan's objections to his system. Instead of an _evasion_, therefore,\r\nany one who considers the subject fairly, will see, in Dr Hutton's\r\nreasoning, nothing but the caution of a philosopher, who wisely\r\nconfines his theory within the same limits by which nature has confined\r\nhis experience and observation.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless true, that Dr Hutton has sometimes expressed himself\r\nas if he thought that the present calcareous rocks are all composed of\r\nanimal remains.[46] This conclusion, however, is more general than the\r\nfacts warrant; and, from some incorrectness or ambiguity of language,\r\nis certainly more general than he intended. The idea of calcareous\r\nrocks, on which he argues throughout his whole theory, is precisely\r\nthat which is stated in the preceding article.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE II. § 6.\r\n\r\n                           _Origin of coal._\r\n\r\n\r\n137. The vegetable origin of coal seems to be sufficiently proved by\r\nthe reasoning in § 5. and 6.; and that reasoning will appear still\r\nmore satisfactory, from what is said at § 28. and 29., concerning the\r\nconsolidation of this fossil. Dr Hutton has treated both of the matter\r\nof coal and of its consolidation. Part. I. Chap. 8., of his Theory of\r\nthe Earth [47].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Vol. i. p. 558, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe notion, however, that coal is of vegetable origin, is not peculiar\r\nto this theory, but has been for some time the prevailing opinion.\r\nBuffon supposes this mineral to be formed from vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances, the oil and fat of which have been converted into bitumen\r\nby the action of acids.[48] A fundamental mistake, however, is\r\ncommitted by this author, and by M. GENSANNE, (author of the natural\r\nhistory of Languedoc,) on whose observations he greatly relies, in\r\nconsidering coal as consisting of bitumen united to earth, thus\r\nomitting the only ingredient essential to coal, namely the carbon or\r\ncharcoal. This may truly be considered as the essential part, because\r\ncoal may exist without bitumen, as in the instance of blind coal, but\r\nnot without charcoal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Hist. Nat. des Mineraux. tom. i. p. 429, 4to edit.]\r\n\r\nAnother theory of coal, very analogous to Dr Hutton's, is that of\r\nARDUINO, professor of mineralogy at Venice, in which he supposes it\r\nformed from vegetable and animal remains from the land and sea, but\r\nchiefly from the latter.[49] This theory of coal is contained in Dr\r\nHutton's, in which the animal and vegetable remains must be supposed\r\nto come both from the earth and the sea. It seems to be without any\r\ngood reason that Arduino considers the sea as the chief source of these\r\nmaterials. His remarks, however, are very ingenious, and deserving of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Saggio Fisico-mineralogico del Sig. Giov. Arduino; Atti\r\ndi Siena, tom. v. p. 228, 281, &c.]\r\n\r\nThese accounts of the origin of coal are all nearly the same; it is\r\nin what relates to the distinction between the common coal, in which\r\nthere is no ligneous structure, and those varieties of it in which that\r\nstructure is apparent, and again in explaining the consolidation of\r\nboth, that the theory laid down here is peculiar.\r\n\r\n138. Some other mineralogists refer one of the ingredients of coal\r\nto the vegetable kingdom, but not the other. Unable to resist the\r\nconviction which arises from the fibrous structure of parts of strata,\r\nand even entire strata of coal, they have supposed, that wood, which\r\nhad been somehow buried in the earth, or perhaps deposited at the\r\nbottom of the sea, had become impregnated with bitumen, which last,\r\nhowever, they consider as of mineral origin. This appears to be the\r\nopinion of Lehman; and also of some very late writers. There seems,\r\nhowever, to be hardly less reason for referring the origin of one part\r\nof coal to the vegetable or animal kingdom than another. The two last\r\nare certainly capable of furnishing both the carbonic and bituminous\r\nparts; and therefore, to derive these from different sources, is at\r\nleast a very unnecessary complication of hypotheses.\r\n\r\n139. Another explanation of coal, very different from any of the\r\npreceding, has lately been advanced and set up in opposition to the\r\nHuttonian Theory. Mr Kirwan,[50] the only mineralogist, I believe, who\r\nhas attempted to derive both the carbonic and bituminous matter of coal\r\nfrom the mineral kingdom, distinguishes between wood coal and mineral\r\ncoal, and gives a theory entirely new of the formation of the latter.\r\nWood coal is that in which the ligneous structure is so apparent, as to\r\nleave no doubt of its vegetable origin; mineral coal is that in which\r\nno such structure can be discovered, and is the same which Dr Hutton\r\nderives from the vegetable juices, and other remains, comminuted,\r\ndispersed, carried into the sea, and there precipitated, so as to\r\nunite with different proportions of earth, and to become afterwards\r\nmineralized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Geol. Essays, essay vii. p. 290.]\r\n\r\nThese two species of coal, which the Huttonian theory considers as\r\ngradations of the same substance, Mr Kirwan regards as perfectly\r\ndistinct, constituting two minerals, of an origin and formation\r\nentirely different. He therefore endeavours to ascertain the\r\ndistinguishing characters of each, considered geologically.\r\n\r\n140. But here the leading distinction, implied in all the rest, that\r\nthe two kinds of coal are never found in the same bed, but always in\r\ndifferent situations, and with different laws of stratification, is\r\nexpressly contradicted by matter of fact. Coal, as is said above, with\r\nits ligneous texture quite apparent, and coal with no such structure\r\nvisible, are often found in the same seam, are brought up from the same\r\nmine, and united in the same specimen. I have a specimen from a bed of\r\ncoal, in the Isle of Sky, found under a basaltic rock, consisting of a\r\nligneous part, which graduates into one in which there is no vestige\r\nof a fibrous texture, and in which the surface is smooth and glossy,\r\nwith a fracture almost vitreous. The upper part of the specimen is\r\ntherefore perfect wood coal, and the under part perfect mineral-coal,\r\nin the language of Mr Kirwan; at the same time that the transition from\r\nthe one to the other is made by insensible degrees. This specimen,\r\nwere it perfectly solitary, is sufficient to prove the identity\r\nof the two species of coal we are now speaking of, and to show,\r\nthat the difference between them is accidental, not essential. The\r\nspecimen, however, is far from being solitary; the number of similar\r\nappearances is so great, as hardly to have escaped the observation\r\nof any mineralogist. Mr Kirwan admits, that wood coal is often found\r\nunder basaltes;[51] but what is essential to be remarked is, that, in\r\nthis instance, we have both the wood coal and the common mineral-coal,\r\nlying under that rock, and the one passing gradually into the other It\r\nappears, indeed, that many of the facts which Mr Kirwan produces, in\r\ntreating of what he calls _carboniferous_ soils, are quite inconsistent\r\nwith the distinction he would make between wood-coal and mineral\r\ncoal.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Geol. Essays, p. 310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Ibid._ p. 311.]\r\n\r\n141. It is, however, true, that there are instances in which the wood\r\ncoal, or fossil wood, as it is usually called, forms entire beds, quite\r\nunconnected with the ordinary coal, and stratified in some respects\r\ndifferently. Such is the Bovey coal in Devonshire, the wood-coal in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and perhaps the Surturbrandt of Iceland. With respect\r\nto the Bovey coal, it does by no means answer to one of Mr Kirwan's\r\nremarks, viz. that late observations have ascertained, that no such\r\nparallelism of the beds, as in mineral coal, nor even any distinct\r\nnumber of strata is found. In the Bovey coal, the number of strata is\r\nvery well defined, by beds of clay regularly interposed; but as to the\r\nextent of these beds, the coal having been worked only at one place,\r\nand by an open pit, without any extensive subterraneous excavation,\r\nnothing is known with certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the Bovey coal too, I must observe, though its beds have the\r\nligneous structure very distinct, the clay interposed between these\r\nbeds, which is but little indurated, contains a great deal of coaly\r\nmatter, in the form of thin flakes, interspersed through it. So far as\r\nI know, there are no mineral reins nor shifts, nor any bed of indurated\r\nstone, that accompany this coal; so that, though one can not doubt of\r\nits vegetable origin, some doubt may be entertained concerning the\r\nnature of the mineralizing operations, to which it has been subjected\r\nThe consideration of these, however, does not belong to the present\r\nargument; and the peculiarities of this semi-mineralized coal, as it\r\nmay be called, have nothing to do with the general question, whether\r\nwood coal and mineral coal are the same substance; about which\r\nquestion, if the gradations are properly considered, I think, no\r\nreasonable doubt can remain.\r\n\r\n142. One of Mr Kirwan's objections to the vegetable origin of coal,\r\nis founded on this fact, that there is, in the museum at Florence, a\r\ncellular sandstone, the cells of which are filled with genuine mineral\r\ncoal. \"Could this (adds he) have been originally wood?\"[53] The answer\r\nto the interrogatory proposed here as a _reductio ad absurdum_, is,\r\nthat most undoubtedly it may have been wood. Sandstone with charred\r\nwood, that is, with wood coal in it, is not an uncommon phenomenon in\r\ncoal countries. I have seen a specimen of this kind from the Hales\r\nQuarry, near Edinburgh, consisting of a piece of charred wood, imbedded\r\nin sandstone; the wood was much altered, but the remains of its fibrous\r\nstructure were distinctly visible. This affords a perfect commentary on\r\nthe specimen in the Florence cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Geol. Essays, p. 321.]\r\n\r\n143. If then it be granted, as I think it must, that the two kinds of\r\ncoal we have been speaking of are of the same origin, it is not very\r\nnecessary to enter on a refutation of Mr Kirwan's theory with respect\r\nto either of them. His account of the formation of mineral coal,\r\nhowever, is so singular, that it cannot be passed over without remark.\r\n\r\nMr Kirwan supposes, 1mo, That natural carbon was originally contained\r\nin many mountains of the granite and porphyritic order, and also in\r\nsiliceous schistus; and might, by disintegration and decomposition, be\r\nseparated from the stony particles. 2do, That both petrol and carbon\r\nare often contained in trap, since hornblende, which has lately been\r\nfound to contain carbon, very frequently enters into its composition.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion (adds he) is, that coal mines, or strata of coal, as well\r\nas the mountains in which they are found, owe their origin to the\r\ndisintegration of primeval mountains, either now totally destroyed,\r\nor whose height and bulk, in consequence of such disintegration, are\r\nconsiderably lessened; and that these rocks, anciently destroyed,\r\ncontained most probably a far larger proportion of carbon and\r\npetrol than those of the same denomination now contain, since their\r\ndisintegration took place at so early a period.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Geol. Essays, p. 328, &c.]\r\n\r\n\"By the decomposition of these mountains, the feldspar and hornblende\r\nwere converted into clay; the bituminous particles, thus set free,\r\nreunited, and were absorbed, partly by the argil, but chiefly by the\r\ncarbonaceous matter, with which they have the greatest affinity. The\r\ncarbonic and bituminous particles, thus united, being difficultly\r\nmiscible with water, and specifically heavier, sunk through the moist,\r\npulpy, incoherent argillaceous masses, and formed the lowest stratum,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nSuch is Mr Kirwan's theory of the formation of coal, and nobody I think\r\nwill dispute the originality of it.\r\n\r\n144. To enter on a formal refutation of an opinion so loaded with\r\nobjections, would be a task as irksome as unnecessary. A few\r\nobservations will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe notion of the great degradation of mountains, involved in this\r\nhypothesis, is the part of it to which I am least disposed to object.\r\nBut I cannot help reminding Mr Kirwan, that the effects of waste are\r\nnot supposed less in this, than in Dr Hutton's theory; and that he has\r\nassumed the very principle, of which that theory makes so much use,\r\nthough he has reserved to himself, as it should seem, the right of\r\ndenying it, when it does not accord with his system. It is indeed worth\r\nwhile to compare what is said concerning the degradation of mountains,\r\nin the above quotations, and still more fully in the book itself, with\r\nwhat is advanced concerning their indestructibility, in another passage\r\nof the same volume:[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Page 436.]\r\n\r\n\"All mountains are not subject to decay; for instance, scarce any of\r\nthose that consist of red granite. The stone of which the Runic rocks\r\nare formed, have withstood decomposition for two thousand years, as\r\ntheir characters evince,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"Basaltic pillars, in general, bid defiance to decay,\" &c. He goes on\r\nto deny every step of the degradation of land, by which it is wasted,\r\ncarried into the sea, and spread out over its bottom, though all these\r\nare necessary _postulata_ in his theory of the formation of coal. One\r\ncan be at no loss about estimating the value of a system, in which such\r\ngross inconsistencies make a necessary part.\r\n\r\n145. The quantity of hornblende and siliceous schistus, necessary to\r\nbe decomposed, in order to produce the coal strata presently existing,\r\nis enormous, and would lead to an estimate of what is worn away from\r\nthe primeval mountains, far exceeding any thing that Dr Hutton has\r\nsupposed. It is true, that Mr Kirwan, never at all embarrassed about\r\npreserving a similitude between nature as she is now, and as she was\r\nheretofore, lays it down, that the part of the primeval mountains\r\nwhich is worn away, contained much more carbon than the part which is\r\nleft behind. This, however, is an arbitrary supposition; and since, in\r\nthis system, such suppositions are so easily admitted, why may we not\r\nconceive, in the primeval mountains, a more copious source of carbonic\r\nmatter than hornblende or siliceous schistus? We have but to imagine,\r\nthat the _diamond_ existed among these mountains in such abundance, as\r\nto constitute large rocks. This stone being made up of pure, or highly\r\nconcentrated carbon, the adamantine summits of a single ridge, by\r\ntheir decomposition, might afford a carbonic basis, sufficient for the\r\ncoal beds of all the surrounding plains.\r\n\r\n146. We may also object to Mr Kirwan, that the siliceous part of\r\nthe mountains has not been chemically dissolved; it has been only\r\nabraded and worn away. Mechanical action has reduced the quartz to\r\ngravel and sand, but has not produced on it any chemical change.\r\nThe carbon, therefore, could not be let loose. Experiment, indeed,\r\nmight be employed, to determine whether the siliceous matter of the\r\nsecondary, and of the primary strata contains this substance in the\r\nsame proportion.\r\n\r\nAgain, a more fatal symptom can hardly be imagined in any theory, than\r\nthat, when the circumstances of the phenomena to be explained are _a\r\nlittle_ changed, the theory is under the necessity of changing _a\r\ngreat deal_. Now, this is what happens to Mr Kirwan's theory, in the\r\nattempt made to explain by it the stratum of coal described in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie_,[56] as cutting a mountain of argillaceous strata\r\nin two, at about three-fourths of its height. This stratum, Mr Kirwan\r\nsays, must have been formed by _transudation_ from the superior part\r\nof the mountain,[57] Besides that this is a gratuitous supposition\r\nof a thing, without example, it involves in it an absurdity, which\r\nbecomes evident the moment the question is asked, What occupied the\r\nplace of the coal-bed before the transudation from the upper part of\r\nthe mountain? Has the _liquid coal_, as it percolated through the upper\r\nstrata, expelled any substance from the place it now occupies? or has\r\nit been powerful enough to raise up, or to float, as it were, the upper\r\npart of the mountain?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Tom. xi. p. 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Geol. Essays, p. 338.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of this bed of coal is not singular, and its formation\r\nis easily explained on Dr Hutton's theory. It is part of a stratum of\r\ncoal, which has been deposited, like all others, at the bottom of the\r\nsea; from whence certain causes, of very general operation, have raised\r\nit up, together with the attending strata: these strata have since\r\nbeen all cut down, and worn away by the operations of the surface; and\r\nthe mountain, with the coal stratum in the middle of it, is a part\r\nof them which has been left behind. There is no wonder, that a coal\r\nstratum should be found alternating with others, in a mountain, any\r\nmore than in the bowels of the earth, and no more need of a separate\r\nexplanation.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: This stratum of coal, which is described by HASSENFRATZ,\r\nis remarkable for being in a mountain which rests immediately on\r\nprimary schistus and granite.]\r\n\r\n147. After all, it may be asked, for what purpose is it that so\r\nmany incongruous and ill supported hypotheses are thus piled on one\r\nanother? is it only to avoid ascribing the carbonic and bituminous\r\nmatter of coal to a substance in which we know with certainty that such\r\nmatter resides in great abundance, in order to derive it from other\r\nsubstances, in which a subtle analysis has shown, that it exists in a\r\nvery small proportion? Such reasoning is so great a trespass on every\r\nprinciple of common sense, not to say of sound philosophy, that, to\r\nbestow any time on the refutation of it, is, in some degree, to fall\r\nunder the same censure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE III. § 7.\r\n\r\n                        _Primitive mountains._\r\n\r\n\r\n148. The enumeration of the different kinds of primary schistus, at\r\n§ 7, is not proposed as at all complete. It will be less defective,\r\nhowever, if we add to it _talcose schistus_, and _lapis ollaris_ or\r\n_potstone_.[59]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Kirwan's Mineralogy, vol. i. p. 155.]\r\n\r\n149. The rocks called here by the name of primary, were first\r\ndistinguished, as forming the basis of all the great chains of\r\nmountains, and as constituting a separate division of the mineral\r\nkingdom, by J. G. LEHMAN, director of the Prussian mines. See his\r\nwork, intituled, _Essai d'une Histoire Naturelle des Couches de la\r\nTerre_.[60] These rocks were regarded by Lehman as parts of the\r\noriginal nucleus of the globe, which had undergone no alteration, but\r\nremained now such as they were at first created; and, agreeably to\r\nthis supposition, he bestowed on them, and on the mountains composed\r\nof them, the name of primitive. He remarks, nevertheless, their\r\ndistribution into beds, either perpendicular to the horizon, or highly\r\ninclined, and the super-position of the secondary and horizontal\r\nstrata. However mineralogists may now differ in their theories from\r\nLehman, they must consider this distinction as a great step in the\r\nscience of geology, and very material to the right arrangement of the\r\nnatural history of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Tom. iii. p. 239, &c. The French translation is in 1759,\r\nbut the original preface is dated at Berlin, 1756.]\r\n\r\n150. Several mineralogists have agreed with him in the supposition,\r\nthat these rocks are a part of the original structure of the globe, and\r\nprior to all organized matter. Of this number is PALLAS;[61] and also\r\nDE LUC, who applies the term _primordial_ to the rocks in question,\r\nand considers them as neither stratified nor formed by water.[62]\r\nIn his subsequent writings, however, he admits their formation from\r\naqueous deposition, as the Neptunists do in general, but holds them to\r\nbe more ancient than organized bodies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Observations sur la Formation des Montagnes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Lettres Phys. Sur l'Histoire de la Terre, tom. ii. p.\r\n206.]\r\n\r\n151. PINI, professor of natural history at Milan, has denied the\r\nstratification of primitive mountains, in a memoir on the mineralogy\r\nof St Gothard, and in another on the revolutions of the globe.[63]\r\nHis reasonings are opposed by SAUSSURE,[64] and are certainly, in\r\nmany respects, very open to attack. They proceed on a comparison\r\nbetween the division of rocks, by what is called the planes of their\r\nstratification, and their division by transverse fissures: two\r\nthings, which he thinks so much alike, that they ought not to be\r\nreferred to different causes; and, as the one cannot be regarded as\r\nthe effect of aqueous deposition, so neither should the other. This\r\nis a very fallacious argument, because it confounds two things that\r\nare essentially different; and, instead of inquiring about a matter\r\nof fact, inquires about its cause. The truth is, that the dispute has\r\narisen from not distinguishing the granite from the schistus mountains,\r\nand from involving both under the name of primitive. M. Pini seems\r\nto be in the right, when he holds the granite of St Gothard to be\r\nunstratified; but it is without any good reason, that he would extend\r\nthe same conclusion to the schistus of that mountain. CHARPENTIER, and\r\nSaussure, in his last two volumes, contend even for the stratification\r\nof granite.[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Memoria sulle Rivoluzioni del Globo Terrestre; Memorie\r\ndella Societa Italiana, tom. v. p. 222, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: See NOTE XV. on Granite.]\r\n\r\nAs the consent, if not universal, is very general for the\r\nstratification of the primary schistus, and the fact itself abundantly\r\nobvious, in almost all the instances I have ever met with, I have not\r\nconsidered it as necessary to enter here into any argument on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE IV. § 8.\r\n\r\n                    _Primary strata not primitive._\r\n\r\n\r\n152. An account of the facts referred to § 8, may be found in Hutton's\r\nTheory, vol. i. p. 332, &c. To what is there said, of the shells\r\ncontained in the primary limestone of Cumberland, I must add, that\r\nI have since had an opportunity of verifying the conjecture, that\r\nthe limestone rock, in which the shells were found, near the head of\r\n_Coniston_ Lake, is part of the same body of strata, where shells were\r\nfound, in a quarry between Ambleside and Low-wood. The limestone of\r\nthat quarry contains several marine objects; it is in strata declining\r\nabout 10° from the perpendicular, toward the S. E., and forms a belt,\r\nstretching across the country from N. E. to S. W.\r\n\r\nIn a quarry where the argillaceous schistus, on the south side of this\r\nlimestone belt, is worked for pavement, are impressions of what I think\r\nmay safely be accounted marine objects; they have the form of shells,\r\nare much indurated, and full of pyrites. They seem to be of the same\r\nkind with the impressions said to be found in a slate quarry, near the\r\nvillage of Mat in Switzerland.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Hutton's Theory, vol. i. p. 327.]\r\n\r\nAnother spot, affording instances of shells in primary limestone, is\r\nin Devonshire. On the sea shore on the east side of Plymouth Dock,\r\nopposite to Stonehouse, I found a specimen of schistose micaceous\r\nlimestone, containing a shell of the bivalve kind: it was struck\r\noff from the solid rock, and cannot possibly be considered as an\r\nadventitious fossil.\r\n\r\nNow, no rocks can be more decided primary than those about Plymouth.\r\nThey consist of calcareous strata, in the form either of marble or\r\nmicaceous limestone, alternating with varieties of the same schistus,\r\nwhich prevails through Cornwall to the west, and extends eastward into\r\nDartmoor, and on the sea-coast, as far as the Berry-head. These all\r\nintersect the horizontal plane, in a line from east to west nearly;\r\nthey are very erect, those at Plymouth being elevated to the north.\r\n\r\nThough, therefore, the remains of marine animals are not frequent among\r\nthe primary rocks, they are not excluded from them; and hence the\r\nexistence of shell-fish and zoophytes, is clearly proved to be anterior\r\nto the formation even of those parts of the present land which are\r\njustly accounted the most ancient.\r\n\r\n153. The rocks which contain sand or gravel, which are of a granulated\r\ntexture, must also be considered as carrying in themselves a testimony\r\nof the most unequivocal kind, of their being derived from the\r\n_detritus_ and waste of former rocks. Now, the fact stated in the text,\r\nconcerning sand found in schistus, most justly accounted primary,\r\nmight be exemplified by actual reference to many spots on the earth's\r\nsurface. A few such will be sufficient in this place.\r\n\r\nSt Gothard is a central point, in one of the greatest tracts of primary\r\nmountains on the face of the earth, yet arenaceous strata are found in\r\nits vicinity. Between Ayrolo and the Hospice of St Gothard, Saussure\r\nfound a rock, composed of an arenaceous or granular paste, including in\r\nit hornblende and garnets. He is somewhat unwilling to give the name\r\n_gres_ to this stone, which M. Besson had done; but he nevertheless\r\ndescribes it as having a granulated structure.[67]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1822.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most indurated rocks that compose the mountains of this\r\nisland, many are arenaceous. Thus, on the western coast of Scotland,\r\nthe great body of high and rugged mountains on the shores of Arafaig,\r\n&c. from Ardnamurchan to Glenelg, consists, in a great measure, of a\r\ngranitic sandstone, in vertical beds. This stone sometimes occupies\r\ngreat tracts; at other times it is alternated with the micaceous, or\r\nother varieties of primary schistus; it occurs, likewise, in several of\r\nthe islands, and is a fossil which we hardly find described or named\r\nby the writers on mineralogy. Much, also, of a highly indurated,\r\nbut granulated quartz, is found in several places in Scotland, in\r\nbeds or strata, alternated with the common schistus of the mountains.\r\nRemarkable instances of this may be seen on the north side of the ferry\r\nof Balachulish, and again on the sea-shore at Cullen. At the latter,\r\nthe strata are remarkably regular, alternating with different species\r\nof schistus. At the former, the quartz is so pure, that the stone has\r\nbeen mistaken for marble.\r\n\r\nThese examples are perhaps sufficient; but I must add, that in the\r\nmicaceous and talcose schisti themselves, thin layers of sand are\r\noften found, interposed between the layers of mica or talc. I have\r\na specimen, from the summit of one of the highest of the Grampian\r\nmountains, where the thin plates, of a talcky or asbestine substance,\r\nare separated by layers of a very fine quartzy sand, not much\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nThe mountain from which it was brought, consists of vertical strata,\r\nmuch intersected by quartz veins. It is impossible to doubt, in this\r\ninstance, that the thin plates of the one substance, and the small\r\ngrains of the other, were deposited together at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand that they were alike produced from the degradation of rocks, more\r\nancient than any which now exist.\r\n\r\n154. In the Neptunian system, as improved by WERNER, an attempt is made\r\nto take off the force of such instances as are produced in § 8, 9, and\r\n152, &c. by distinguishing rocks, as to their formation, into three\r\ndifferent orders, the primitive, the intermediate, and the secondary,\r\nor, to speak more properly, into primary, secondary, and tertiary. The\r\nsame mineralogist distinguishes, among the materials of these rocks,\r\nbetween what he terms chemical and mechanical deposits. By mechanical\r\ndeposits, are understood sand, gravel, and whatever bears the mark of\r\nfracture and attrition; by chemical deposits, those which are regularly\r\ncrystallized, or which have a tendency to crystallization, and in which\r\nthe action of mechanical causes cannot be traced. This distinction\r\nis founded in nature, and proceeds on real and palpable differences;\r\nbut the application made of it to the three kinds of strata just\r\nenumerated, seems by no means entitled to the same praise.\r\n\r\nThe primitive rocks contain, it is said, none but chemical deposits,\r\nand are entirely composed of them: the intermediate contain a mixture\r\nof both, and also some vestiges of organized bodies: the secondary\r\nconsist almost entirely of the mechanical, or of the remains of such\r\nbodies, with little of the chemical. The first of these, then, are held\r\nto contain no mark or vestige whatsoever of any thing more ancient\r\nthan themselves, and are, in the strictest sense, primeval, or formed\r\nof the first materials, deposited by the immense ocean which originally\r\nencompassed the globe.\r\n\r\nAfter them were formed the intermediate, mostly consisting of chemical\r\ndeposits, but containing also some animal remains, and some spoils from\r\nthe land, subjected to the various kinds of destruction, which even\r\nthen made a part of the order of nature. These rocks, it is alleged,\r\nare chiefly argillaceous, are less indurated than the primary, and not\r\nintersected by veins of quartz.\r\n\r\nThe secondary were formed from the remains of the other two, and\r\ncontain more mechanical deposits than any other.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of what I understand to be Werner's opinion concerning the\r\ndifferent formation of the strata, is chiefly taken from a view of his\r\nsystem, in the _Journal de Physique_ for 1800.\r\n\r\n155. The main objection to the distinction here made between the\r\nprimary and the intermediate strata, is founded on the facts that\r\nhave been just stated. The sandstone of St Gothard is from a country\r\nhaving every character of a primary one in the highest perfection. The\r\ninstances I have mentioned from the Highlands of Scotland, are from\r\nmountains, less elevated indeed than the Alps, but where the rock is\r\nmicaceous, talcose, or siliceous, in planes erect to the horizon, and\r\nintersected by veins' of quartz. The shells from Plymouth are from a\r\nrock, that Werner would, I think, admit to be truly primitive. Those\r\nfrom the lakes, also, are from the centre of a country, occupied by\r\nporphyry, schorl, hornstone-schistus, and many others, about the order\r\nof which there can be no dispute. It is true, that in this tract\r\nthere are argillaceous strata, of the kind that might be accounted\r\nintermediate, were they not interposed among those that are certainly\r\nprimary; and this very intermixture shows, how little foundation there\r\nis for the distinction attempted to be made between the formation of\r\nthe one and of the other. If there is any principle in mineralogy,\r\nwhich may be considered as perfectly ascertained, it is, that rocks\r\nsimilarly stratified, and alternated with one another, are of the same\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nHence we conclude, that there is _no order of strata yet known_, that\r\ndoes not contain proofs of the existence of more ancient strata. We see\r\nnothing, in the strict sense, primitive. It must be understood, that\r\nwhat is here said has no reference to granite, which I do not consider\r\nas a stratified rock, and in which neither the remains of organized\r\nbodies, nor sand, have I believe been ever found; though some\r\ninstances will be hereafter mentioned, where granite contains fragments\r\nof other stone, viz. of different kinds of primary schistus.\r\n\r\nTo the instances of sand involved in primary schistus, I might have\r\nadded many from the rocks of that order on the coast of Berwickshire,\r\nof which mention is so often made in these Illustrations; but I wished\r\nto draw the evidence from those rocks that are most unequivocally\r\nprimary, and to which the Wernerian distinction of _intermediate_ could\r\nnot possibly be applied.\r\n\r\nIf any one assert, as M. De Luc has done, that sand is a chemical\r\ndeposit, a certain mode of crystallization which quartz sometimes\r\nassumes, let him draw the line which separates sand from gravel; and\r\nlet him explain why quartz, in the form of sand, is not found in\r\nmineral veins, in granite, nor in basaltes, that is, in none of the\r\nsituations where the appearances of crystallization are most general\r\nand best ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE V. § 10.\r\n\r\n                        _Transportation of the\r\n                       materials of the strata._\r\n\r\n\r\n156. The great transportation or _travelling_ of the materials of the\r\nstrata, supposed by Dr Hutton, has been treated as absurd by some\r\nof his opponents, particularly De Luc and Kirwan. These philosophers\r\nseem not to have observed, that their own system, and indeed every\r\nsystem which derives the secondary strata from the primary, involves\r\na transportation of materials, hardly less than is supposed in the\r\nHuttonian theory, and a degradation of the primeval mountains, in\r\nmany instances much greater. To form some notion of this degradation,\r\nit must be recollected, that the primeval mountains, which furnished\r\nthe materials of the secondary strata in the plains, cannot have\r\nstood in the place now occupied by these plains. This is obvious; and\r\ntherefore we must necessarily regard the secondary strata as derived\r\nfrom the primitive mountains which are the nearest to them, and of\r\nwhich a part still remains. This part is sufficient to define the\r\nbase of the original mountains; and the quantity of the secondary\r\nstrata which surround them may help us to make some estimate of their\r\nheight. Let us take, for instance, the extensive tract of secondary\r\ncountry about Newcastle, where coal mines have been sunk through a\r\nsuccession of secondary strata, to the depth of more than a thousand\r\nfeet. This secondary country may be considered as comprehending almost\r\nthe whole of the counties of Northumberland and Durham, and probably\r\nas extending very far under the part of the German Ocean which washes\r\ntheir coasts; and the whole strata composing it must be derived, on\r\nthe hypothesis we are now considering, from the Cheviot Hills, on one\r\nside, and from those in the high parts of Westmoreland and Cumberland\r\non the other, comprehending the Alston-Moor Hills, and the large group\r\nof primary mountains, so well known from the sublime and romantic\r\nscenery of the _Lakes_. Now, the mountains which stood on this base,\r\nhad not only to supply the materials for the tract already mentioned,\r\non the east, but had also their contingent to furnish to the plains on\r\nthe west and north; the Cheviots to Roxburghshire and Berwickshire;\r\nthe Northumberland mountains to the coal strata about Whitehaven, and\r\nalong the sea coast to Lancashire. On the whole, we shall not exceed\r\nthe truth, if we suppose, that the secondary strata, at the feet of the\r\nabove mountains, are six or seven times more extensive than the base\r\nof the mountainous tract. If then we take the medium depth of these\r\nsecondary strata to be one thousand feet, it is evident, that the mass\r\nof stone which composes them, if it were placed on the same base with\r\nthe primitive mountains, would reach to the height of six thousand\r\nfeet. This is supposing the mass to preserve the breadth of its base\r\nuniformly to the summit; but if it be supposed to taper, as mountains\r\nusually do, we must multiply this six thousand by three, in order to\r\nhave the height of these primeval mountains, which, therefore, were\r\noriginally elevated not less than eighteen thousand feet; in height,\r\ntherefore, they once rivalled the Cordilleras, and are now but poorly\r\nrepresented by the hills of Skidaw and Helvellyn. It were easy to show,\r\nthat this estimate is still below the result that strictly follows from\r\nthe Neptunian hypothesis; but it is unnecessary to proceed further,\r\nthan to prove, that the principle of the degradation of mountains, is\r\ninvolved in that hypothesis to an excessive and improbable degree; and\r\nthat the supporters of it, have either been guilty of the inconsistency\r\nof refusing to Dr Hutton the moderate use of a principle, which they\r\nthemselves employ in its utmost extent, or of not having sufficiently\r\nadverted to the consequences of their own system.\r\n\r\n157. The formation of secondary strata from the degradation of the\r\ncontiguous mountains, on close examination, is subject to many\r\nother difficulties of the same kind. Mountains of secondary strata,\r\nand nearly horizontal, are found in this island of the height of\r\nthree thousand feet. Such are Ingleborough, Wharnside, and perhaps\r\nsome others on the west of Yorkshire. The whole chain, indeed,\r\nfor secondary mountains, is of great elevation. The strata are of\r\nlimestone, and of a very coarse-grained sandstone, alternating with it.\r\nNo mountains can more clearly point out, that the strata of which they\r\nconsist were once continued quite across the vallies which now separate\r\nthem; and hence, if the materials of those strata were indeed furnished\r\nfrom any contiguous primitive mountains, the latter must have been, out\r\nof all proportion, higher than any mountains now in Britain.\r\n\r\n158. Thus, a great degradation of the primitive mountains, and of\r\ncourse a great travelling of their materials, is proved to make a\r\nnecessary part of the Neptunian theory. The extent of this travelling\r\nor transportation may be rendered more evident, if we apply a similar\r\nmode of reasoning to larger portions of the globe. The north-west of\r\nEurope furnishes us an instance of a very extensive tract of secondary\r\ncountry, comprehending the greater part of Britain, the whole of\r\nFlanders and Holland, part of Germany, the northern provinces of\r\nFrance, and probably the bed of the German Ocean, at least for a great\r\nextent. Within this circle almost all is secondary, and on the sides\r\nof it all round are placed ridges or groups of primitive mountains,\r\nnamely the mountains of Auvergne, at least in part, and going round by\r\nthe east, the Alps, the Vosges, the Hartz, the Highlands and Western\r\nIslands of Scotland, the hilly countries of Cumberland, Wales, and\r\nCornwall. This zone of primitive mountains, on the supposition of the\r\nNeptunists, must have risen up in the form of islands in the great\r\nocean, that originally covered the earth, forming a kind of circular\r\nArchipelago, including in its bosom a sea, which was from seven to\r\nfive hundred miles in diameter. Over the whole of this extent, the\r\n_detritus_ of the above mountains must have been carried, in order to\r\nform the flat interjacent countries which are now exposed to our view.\r\nSuch then, even on their own supposition, is the extent to which the\r\nNeptunists must admit that the materials of the primeval mountains were\r\ntransported by the ocean.\r\n\r\n159. This transportation of materials, may not be so great as that\r\nwhich is involved in Dr Hutton's theory, but is such as should make the\r\nenemies of his system consider, how nearly the principles they _must_\r\nintroduce, agree with those that they _would_ reject. This is one\r\nfact, out of many, which shows, that there is at present a much nearer\r\nagreement between the systems of geology, than between their authors.\r\n\r\n160. To these facts, demonstrating the great transportation of fossils\r\nin some former conditions of the globe, we may add another, recognised\r\nby all mineralogists. The animal exuviæ contained in limestone and\r\nmarble, are often known to belong to seas, extremely remote from the\r\ncountries where they are now found. In the chalk-beds of England, in\r\nthe limestones of France, a great proportion of the petrifactions\r\nbelong to the tropical seas, and appear to have been brought from the\r\nvicinity of the equator. Buffon observes, that of the fossil shells\r\nfound in France, it has been disputed, whether the foreign are not\r\nmore numerous than the native; and, though he is himself of opinion\r\nthat they are not, it is evident that they must bear a considerable\r\nproportion to the whole.[68] In the petrifactions of Monte Bolca, near\r\nVerona, where the impressions of fish are preserved between the laminæ\r\nof a calcareous schistus, one hundred and five different species have\r\nbeen enumerated, of which thirty-nine are from the Asiatic seas, three\r\nfrom the African, eighteen from those of South, and eleven from those\r\nof North America.[69] Similar observations have been made on the marine\r\nplants, and the impressions of vegetables, found in rocks, in different\r\nparts of Europe. At St Chaumont, near Lyons, is found an argillaceous\r\nschistus, covering a bed of coal, every lamina of which is marked with\r\nthe impressions of the stem, leaf, or other part of some plant; and it\r\nhappens, says M. FONTENELLE, by an unaccountable destination of nature,\r\nthat not one of these plants is a native of France. They are all ferns\r\nof different species, peculiar to the East Indies, or the warmer\r\nclimates of America. Here also was found the fruit of a tree, which\r\ngrows only on the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Buffon, Théorie de la Terre, art. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Saussure, Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1535.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Mém. De l'Acad. Des Sciences, 1718, p. 3 and 287; and\r\n1721, p. 89, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe same holds of the bodies of amphibious animals which now make a\r\npart of the fossil kingdom. The head and the bones of crocodiles have\r\nbeen found in the island of Shepey, at the mouth of the Thames; and the\r\nremains of an animal of the same species, but of a variety now peculiar\r\nto the Ganges, have been discovered in the alum rocks on the coast of\r\nYorkshire.[71] These proofs of the transportation of materials by the\r\nsea, have the advantage of involving nothing hypothetical, and of being\r\nequally addressed to the geologists of every persuasion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Phil. Trans. vol. l. p. 688. CAMPER denies that the\r\nremains here mentioned belong to the crocodile, or any amphibious\r\nanimal, and refers them to the balænaæ. He passes the same judgment on\r\nthose fossil bones from St Peter's Mount, near Maestricht, which have\r\nbeen supposed to belong to the crocodile; he looks on them as belonging\r\nto whales, though of an unknown species. In this Mount, so famous for\r\nits petrifactions, he finds many specimens of bones, which he thinks\r\nbelong to the turtle. Phil. Trans. vol lxxvi. p. 443. The opinion of an\r\nauthor, so well skilled in comparative anatomy, must be regarded as of\r\ngreat weight: if it takes from our argument in one part, it adds to it\r\nin another, and the acquisition of the turtle makes up abundantly for\r\nthe loss of the crocodile.]\r\n\r\nOn this subject I cannot help observing, that the accurate comparison\r\nof the animal exuviæ of the mineral kingdom, with their living\r\narchetypes, is not merely a curious inquiry, but is one that may lead\r\nto important consequences, concerning the nature and direction of the\r\nforces which have changed, and are continually changing, the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n161. These remarks I have thought it proper to add to the proofs of the\r\ncomposition of the present from former strata, in order to show, that\r\nthe great transportation of materials involved in that supposition, is\r\nnot only conformable to the hypothesis of the Neptunists concerning\r\nthe secondary strata, but is also proved by the most direct evidence,\r\nindependently of all hypothesis. All this reasoning regards the ancient\r\nstate of the globe. Whether such a travelling of stony bodies makes\r\na part of the system now actually carrying on, will be considered in\r\nanother place.[72]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: See NOTE XIX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE VI. § 13.\r\n\r\n                _Mr Kirwan's notion of precipitation._\r\n\r\n\r\n162. The Neptunist who has provided the means of dissolving the\r\nmaterials of the strata, has only performed half his work, and must\r\nfind it a task of equal difficulty to force this powerful menstruum\r\nto part with its solution. Mr Kirwan, aware in some degree of this\r\ndifficulty, has attempted to obviate it in a very singular way. First,\r\nhe ascribes the solution of all substances in water, or in what he\r\ncalls the chaotic fluid, to their being finely pulverised, or created\r\nin a state of the most minute division. Next, as to the deposition, the\r\nsolvent being, as he acknowledges, very insufficient in quantity, the\r\nprecipitation took place, (he says,) on that account the more rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf he means by this to say, that a precipitation without solution\r\nwould take place the sooner the more inadequate the menstruum was to\r\ndissolve the whole, the proposition may be true; but will be of no\r\nuse to explain the crystallization of minerals, (the very object he\r\nhas in view,) because to crystallization, it is not a bare subsidence\r\nof particles suspended in a fluid, but it is a passage from chemical\r\nsolution to non-solution, or insolubility, that is required.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, he means to say, that the solution actually took\r\nplace more quickly, and was more immediately followed by precipitation,\r\nbecause the quantity of the menstruum was insufficient, this is to\r\nassert, that the weaker the cause, the more instantaneous will be its\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOf two propositions the one of which is nugatory, and the other absurd,\r\nit is not material to inquire which the author had in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE VII. § 16.\r\n\r\n                 _Compression in the mineral regions._\r\n\r\n\r\n163. It is worthy of remark, that the effects ascribed to compression\r\nin the Huttonian Theory, very much resemble those which Sir ISAAC\r\nNEWTON supposes to be produced in the sun and the fixed stars by\r\nthat same cause. \"Are not,\" says he, \"the sun and fixed stars great\r\nearths, vehemently hot, whose heat is conserved by the greatness of\r\nthe bodies, and the mutual action and reaction between them, and the\r\nlight which they emit; and _whose parts are kept from fuming away,\r\nnot only by their fixity, but also by the vast weight and density of\r\nthe atmospheres incumbent upon them, and very strongly compressing\r\nthem_.\"[73]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Newton's Optics, Query 11.]\r\n\r\n164. The fact of water boiling at a lower temperature under a less\r\ncompression, is sufficient to justify the supposition, that bodies may\r\nbe made by pressure to endure extreme heat, without the dissipation\r\nof their parts, that is, without evaporation or combustion. A further\r\n_postulatum_ is introduced in Dr Hutton's theory, namely, that compound\r\nbodies, such as carbonate of lime, when the compression prevents their\r\nseparation, may admit of fusion, notwithstanding that the fixed part\r\nmay be infusible when separated from the volatile. This assumption is\r\nsupported by the analogical fact of the fusion of the carbonate of\r\nbarytes, as mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n165. In a region where the action of heat was accompanied with such\r\ncompression as is here supposed, there could be no fire, properly so\r\ncalled, and no combustion; this is admitted by Dr Hutton, and it is\r\ntherefore a fallacious argument which is brought against his theory,\r\nfrom the impossibility of fire being maintained in the bowels of the\r\nearth. This impossibility is precisely what he supposes; and yet Mr\r\nKirwan's arguments are directed, not against the existence of heat in\r\nthe interior of the earth, but against the existence of burning and\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nAfter taking notice,[74] that Saussure had succeeded, though with\r\nextreme difficulty, in melting a particle of limestone, so small as\r\nto be visible only with a microscope, \"what (adds he) must have been\r\nthe heat necessary to melt whole mountains of this matter? Judging\r\nby all that we at present know of heat, such a high degree could\r\nonly be produced by the purest air, acting on an enormous quantity\r\nof combustible matter. Now, EHRMAN observed, that the combustion of\r\ntwo hundred and eighty cubic inches of air, acting on charcoal, was\r\nnot able to effect the fusion of one grain of Carrara marble; from\r\nwhence it is apparent, that all the air in the atmosphere, nor in ten\r\natmospheres, would not melt a single mountain of this substance, of\r\nany extent, even if there were a sufficient quantity of inflammable\r\nmatter for it to act upon. Judging also of subterraneous heat by what\r\nwe know of that of volcanoes, no such heat exists: the highest they\r\nin general produce, is that requisite for the fusion of the volcanic\r\nglass called obsidian, which Saussure found not to exceed 115° of\r\nWedgewood; but basaltine, which requires 140° of Wedgewood, is never\r\nmelted in the lavas of Ætna. How little capable, then, would volcanic\r\nheat be to effect the fusion of Carrara marble, which, according to\r\nthe same excellent author, would require a heat of upwards of 6300°\r\nof Wedgewood, if this pyrometer could extend so far? And in what\r\ncircumstances does Dr Hutton suppose this astonishing heat to have\r\nexisted, and even still to exist, under the ocean, in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, where neither a sufficient quantity of pure air, nor of\r\ncombustible matter, capable of such mighty effects, can, with any\r\nappearance of probability, be supposed to exist: and, without these,\r\nsuch degrees of heat cannot even be imagined, without flying into the\r\nregion of chimeras.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Geol. Essays, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n166. Now, this reasoning is not applicable to Dr Hutton's hypothesis\r\nof subterraneous heat, because it is grounded on experiments, where\r\nthat very separation of the volatile and fixed parts takes place, which\r\nis excluded in that hypothesis. When limestone or marble is exposed\r\nto such heat as is here mentioned, or even to heat of a degree vastly\r\ninferior, the carbonic gas is expelled, and the body is reduced to pure\r\nlime; from the refractory nature of which, as we learn from the fact\r\nrelative to barytes, mentioned above, no conclusion can be drawn as to\r\nthe infusibility of the same substance, when combined with the carbonic\r\ngas. The Carrara marble may require a heat of 6300° of Wedgewood, to\r\nmelt it in the open air, where the carbonic gas escapes from it; but\r\nunder such a pressure as would retain this gas, it cannot be inferred,\r\nthat it might not melt with the heat of a glass-house furnace. In like\r\nmanner, it may be true, that two hundred and eighty cubic inches of\r\nair, acting on charcoal, cannot effect the fusion of one grain of this\r\nmarble, after its fixed air is driven off from it; but we cannot from\r\nthence draw any inference, applicable to a case where the carbonic gas\r\nis retained, and where the action of heat is independent of atmospheric\r\nair.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, can be more inconclusive than this reasoning,\r\nas it proceeds on the supposition, that Dr Hutton's system admits\r\npropositions, which in fact it expressly denies.\r\n\r\n167. Of the production and maintenance of heat, in circumstances\r\nso different from those of ordinary experience, we can hardly be\r\nexpected to give any explanation; but we are not entitled, merely\r\non that account, to doubt of the existence of such heat. Mr Kirwan\r\nthinks otherwise: \"Judging,\" he says, \"from all we at present know of\r\nheat, such a high degree of it, (as will melt limestone,) could only\r\nbe produced by the purest air, acting on an enormous quantity of\r\ncombustible matter. Without these, such degrees of heat cannot even be\r\nimagined, without flying into the region of chimeras.\"[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Geol. Essays, p. 454.]\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, the high degree of temperature which is\r\nhere understood, is probably not necessary to the purposes of\r\nmineralization, as has just been shown; and, in the second place, it is\r\nnot FIRE, in the usual sense of the word, but HEAT, which is required\r\nfor that purpose; and there is nothing chimerical in supposing, that\r\nnature has the means of producing heat, even in a very great degree,\r\nwithout the assistance of fuel or of vital air. Friction is a source\r\nof heat, unlimited, for what we know, in its extent, and so perhaps\r\nare other operations, both chemical and mechanical; nor are either\r\ncombustible substances, or vital air, concerned in the heat thus\r\nproduced. So also the heat of the sun's rays in the focus of a burning\r\nglass, the most intense that is known, is independent of the substances\r\njust mentioned; and, though that heat certainly could not calcine a\r\nmetal, nor even burn a piece of wood, without oxygenous gas, it would\r\ndoubtless produce as high a temperature in the absence as in the\r\npresence of that gas.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that it is not by the solar rays that subterraneous heat\r\nis produced; but still, from this instance, we see, that there is no\r\nincongruity in supposing the production of heat to be independent of\r\ncombustible bodies, and of vital air. We are indeed, in all cases,\r\nstrangers to the origin of heat; philosophers dispute, at this moment,\r\nconcerning the source of that which is produced by burning; and much\r\nmore are they at a loss to determine, what upholds the light and heat\r\nof the great luminary, which animates all nature by its influence. If\r\nwe would form any opinion on this object, we shall do well to attend\r\nto the suggestions of that great philosopher, who was hardly less from\r\nothers by his doubts and conjectures, than by his most rigorous and\r\nprofound investigations. \"May not great, dense, and fixed bodies, when\r\nheated beyond a certain degree, emit light so copiously, as, by the\r\nemission and reaction of its light, and the reflections and refractions\r\nof its rays within its pores, to grow still hotter, till it comes to\r\na certain period of heat, such as is that of the sun? And, are not\r\nthe sun and fixed stars great earths, vehemently hot, whose heat is\r\nconserved by the greatness of the bodies, and the mutual action and\r\nreaction between them and the light which they emit?\"[76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Newton's Optics, _ubi supra_.]\r\n\r\n168. Some recent experiments, seem to make the suggestions in this\r\nquery applicable to an opaque body like the earth, as well as to\r\nluminous bodies, such as the sun and fixed stars. The radiation of\r\nheat, where there is no light, was first rendered probable by the\r\nexperiments of M. PICTET of Geneva;[77] and the only objections to\r\nwhich the conclusions from those experiments seemed liable, are removed\r\nby the late very important discoveries of Dr HERSCHEL.[78] From these\r\nit appears, that heat is capable of refraction and reflection, as well\r\nas light, so that it is not absurd to suppose, that _the heat of great,\r\ndense, and faced bodies, may be conserved by the greatness of the\r\nbodies, and the mutual action and reaction between them and the heat\r\nwhich they emit_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Essai sur le Feu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of subterraneous heat is still further rendered probable\r\nfrom the researches of MAIRAN, which tend to show, that there is\r\nanother source of terrestrial heat besides the influence of the solar\r\nrays.[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Mém. de l'Acad. des Sciences, 1765, p. 143.]\r\n\r\nWhatever be the truth with regard to these conjectures, it is certain,\r\nthat the first and original source of heat is independent of burning.\r\nBurning is an _effect_ of the concentration of heat; and though, by a\r\ncertain reaction, it has the power of continuing and augmenting that\r\nheat, it never can be regarded as its primary and material cause. When,\r\ntherefore, we suppose a source of heat, independent of fire and of\r\nburning, we suppose what certainly exists in nature, though we are not\r\ninformed of the manner of its existence, nor of its place, otherwise\r\nthan from considering the phenomena of the mineral kingdom.\r\n\r\n169. Lastly, we are not entitled, according to any rules of\r\nphilosophical investigation, to reject a principle, to which we are\r\nfairly led by an induction from facts, merely because we cannot give\r\na satisfactory explanation of it. It would be a very unsound view of\r\nphysical science, which would induce one to deny the principle of\r\ngravitation, though he cannot explain it, or even though the admission\r\nof it reduces him to great metaphysical difficulties. If indeed a\r\ndownright absurdity, or inconsistency with known and established\r\nfacts, be involved in any principle, it ought not to be admitted,\r\nhowever it may seem calculated to explain other appearances. If, for\r\ninstance, Dr Hutton held, that combustion was carried on in a region\r\nwhere there was no vital air, we should have said, that he admitted\r\nan absurdity, and that a theory founded on such _postulata_ was worse\r\nthan chimerical. But, if the only thing imputable to him is, that,\r\nbeing led by induction to admit the fusion of mineral substances in the\r\nbowels of the earth, he has assumed the existence of such heat as was\r\nsufficient for this fusion, though he is unable to assign the cause\r\nof it, I believe it will be found, that his system only shares in an\r\nimperfection, which is common to all physical theories, and which the\r\nutmost improvement of science will never completely remove.\r\n\r\n170. Thus, then, we are led, it must be allowed, into the _region of\r\nhypothesis_ and conjecture, but by no means into that of chimeras.\r\nIndeed, the reproach of flying into the latter region, may be said to\r\ncome but ill from one, who has trode so often the crude consistence of\r\nthe chaos, and who delights to dwell beyond the boundaries of nature.\r\nBy sojourning there long, it is not impossible that the eye may become\r\nso accustomed to fantastic forms, that the figures and proportions of\r\nnature shall appear to it deformed and monstrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE VIII. § 24.\r\n\r\n                        _Sparry structure of\r\n                      calcareous petrifactions._\r\n\r\n\r\n171. When the shells and corals in limestone are quoted by\r\nmineralogists, it is not always considered in what state they are\r\nfound. In general, they have a sparry structure, very different\r\nfrom that of the original shell or coral, of which, however, they\r\nretain the figure with wonderful exactness, though probably sometimes\r\naltered in size. Though sparry, they are often foliated, and preserve\r\ntheir animal, in conjunction with their mineral, texture. Now, this\r\ncrystallization is a mark of some operation, quite different from any\r\nthat can be ascribed to the water in which these bodies had their\r\norigin, and by which they were brought into their place. They were\r\nimpervious to water; and it cannot be said that their sparry structure\r\nhas been derived from the percolation of that fluid, carrying new\r\ncalcareous matter into their pores. We can account for the change\r\nproduced in them, I think, only by supposing them to have been softened\r\nby heat, so as to permit their parts to arrange selves anew, and to\r\nassume the characteristic organization of mineral substances.\r\n\r\nAll shells have not the change effected on them that is here referred\r\nto; those in chalk, for instance, retain very much their original form\r\nin all respects. This is what we might expect from the very different\r\ndegree of intensity, with which the mineralizing cause has acted on\r\nchalk, and on limestone or marble. In general, it is in the hardest\r\nand most consolidated limestone, that the marine objects are most\r\ncompletely changed into spar.\r\n\r\nIt would be exceedingly interesting to examine, whether any of the\r\nphosphoric acid remains united to shells of either of these kinds. We\r\nmight most readily expect it to be united, in a certain degree, to the\r\nshells that are least mineralized.\r\n\r\nThis experiment would enable us also to appreciate the force of Mr\r\nKirwan's argument against the finer marbles, such as the Carrara,\r\ncontaining shells.[80] This argument proceeds on an experiment,\r\nmentioned in the _Turin Memoirs_ for 1789, from which it appears,\r\nthat no phosphoric acid is found in pure limestone; and its absence,\r\nMr Kirwan says, cannot be attributed to fusion, as phosphoric acid is\r\nindestructible by heat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Geol. Essays, p. 458.]\r\n\r\nHe calls this a demonstration; but, in order to entitle it to that\r\nname, it will be necessary, first, to prove, that phosphoric acid\r\nexists in those limestones which evidently consist of shells in a\r\nmineralized state. If these are found without phosphoric acid, it is\r\nevident that the preceding argument fails entirely. If they are found\r\nto contain that acid, it will then no doubt afford a probability,\r\nthough not a demonstration, that Carrara marble does not directly\r\noriginate from shells.\r\n\r\nThat nature has some process, by which the above acid is separated\r\nfrom the earth of bones, and probably also from the earth of shells,\r\nis evident from the state in which the bones are found in the caves of\r\nBayreuth. Those that are the most recent, and least petrified, contain\r\nmost of the phosphoric acid. Where the petrifaction has proceeded far,\r\nthat acid is not found.\r\n\r\n172. Among many of the strata, such a fluidity has prevailed, as\r\nto enable some of the substances included in them to crystallize.\r\nCalcareous spar and siliceous crystals are often found in stratified\r\nrocks, forming veins of secretion, or lining close cavities, included\r\non all sides by the uncrystallized rock. In the instances of gneiss,\r\nand many species of marble, almost the whole matter of the stratum is\r\ncrystallized. This union of a stratified and crystallized structure\r\nin the same substance, has a great affinity to that union of the\r\ncrystallized with the organic structure of shells and corals which has\r\njust been mentioned; and both are doubtless to be referred to the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE IX. § 81.\r\n\r\n                           _Petroleum, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n173. According to the theory of coal laid down above, its two chief\r\nmaterials, charcoal and bitumen, being furnished by the vegetable and\r\nanimal kingdoms, both of the land and of the sea, have formed with one\r\nanother a new combination, by the action of subterraneous heat; but\r\nhave also, in some cases, been separated by that same action, where\r\nthe degree of compression necessary for their union, happened to be\r\nwanting. The carbonic part, when thus separated from the bituminous,\r\nforms an infusible coal, which burns without flame: the bituminous\r\npart, when separated from the carbonic, is found in the various states\r\nof naphtha, petroleum, asphaltes, and jet.\r\n\r\nThe great resemblance of infusible or blind coal, to the residuum\r\nobtained by the distillation of bituminous coal; and again, the\r\ncoincidence of the bitumens just named, with the volatile part, or\r\nthe matter brought over by such distillation, are strong arguments\r\nin favour of this theory. The other facts in the natural history of\r\ncoal, serve to confirm the same conclusion; but it must be confessed,\r\nthat what we know of the pure bitumens, except the circumstance\r\njust mentioned, is of a more ambiguous nature, and may be reconciled\r\nwith different theories. The drops of petroleum contained within the\r\ncavities of the limestone, mentioned at § 31, are however strong facts\r\nin confirmation of Dr Hutton's opinions, and they are furnished by the\r\nsubstances purely bituminous. A careful examination would probably\r\nmake us acquainted with others of the same kind, for limestone is very\r\noften the matrix in which petroleum and asphaltes are contained. The\r\ngreatest mine of asphaltes in Europe, that in the _Val de Travers_ in\r\nthe territory of Neufchâtel, is in limestone, from which, though it in\r\nsome places exudes, it is in general extracted by the application of\r\nheat. The strata for several leagues are impregnated with bitumen; and,\r\nif examined with attention, would probably afford specimens similar to\r\nthose which have just been mentioned.\r\n\r\n174. It is a general remark, that, where petroleum is found, on\r\ndigging deeper, they come to asphaltes; and, at a depth still greater,\r\nthey discover coal. This probably does not hold invariably; but\r\nit is certain, that most of the fountains of petroleum are in the\r\nneighbourhood of coal strata. Petroleum and asphaltes are found in\r\ngreat abundance in Alsace, in a bed of sand, between two beds of clay\r\nor argillaceous schistus, and the same country also affords coal.[81]\r\nThis is true likewise of the fossil pitch of Coal-Brookdale; and of the\r\npetroleum found in St Catharine's Well, near Edinburgh. Auvergne[82]\r\ncontains abundance of fossil pitch, which exudes, in the warm season,\r\nfrom a rock impregnated with it through its whole mass. There are also\r\ncoal strata in the same country, not far distant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Encyclopédia, mot, _Asphalte_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Voyage en Auvergne, par Lagrand, tom. i. p. 351.]\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory observation relating to this subject, has lately\r\nbeen communicated from a country, with whose natural history we were\r\ntill of late entirely unacquainted. In the Burmha empire, petroleum is\r\ndug up in an argillaceous earth, from the depth of seventy cubits. This\r\nargillaceous earth, or schistus, lies under a bed of freestone; and\r\nunder all, about one hundred and thirty cubits from the surface, is a\r\nbed of coal.[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Asiatic Researches, vol. vi, art. 6. p. 130.]\r\n\r\n175. In the petroleum lake of the Island of Trinidad, described _Phil\r\nTrans._ 1789, the petroleum evidently exudes from the rock, and is\r\ncollected in a variety of springs in the bottom, after which it\r\nhardens, and acquires the consistency of pitch. The manner, therefore,\r\nin which petroleum exists in the strata, is very consistent with the\r\nidea of its having been introduced in the form of a hot vapour.\r\n\r\nEven amber appears to have some relation to coal. It is found in the\r\nunconsolidated earth in Prussia and Pomerania; but I am not sure\r\nwhether this earth is _travelled_ or not. In the same earth where the\r\namber is found, there is often a mixture of coaly matter, which burns\r\nin the fire; it is apparently fibrous, and has been considered as a\r\nkind of fossil-wood.[84]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Buffon, Hist. Nat. des Mineraux, tom. ii. p. 5.]\r\n\r\nThese circumstances make out a connection between the purer bitumens\r\nand ordinary coal; but do not, it must be acknowledged, establish any\r\nthing with respect to the more immediate relation, supposed in this\r\ntheory to exist between them and blind coal. It is probable, indeed,\r\nthat, to discover any facts of that kind, the natural history of both\r\nsubstances must be more carefully examined; the natural history of\r\nblind coal, in particular, has hitherto been but little attended to.\r\n\r\n176. A fact is mentioned by Mr Kirwan, which must not be regarded as\r\nless valuable for being adverse to this theory. It is, that neither\r\npetroleum, nor any fossil bitumen, is found in the vicinity of the\r\nKilkenny coal, as might be expected, if that coal was deprived of\r\nits bituminous part by subterraneous distillation.[85] This, however,\r\nadmits of explanation. Though a general connection, on the above\r\nhypothesis, might be expected between bitumens and infusible coal, we\r\ncannot look for it in every instance. The heat which drove off the\r\nbitumen from one part of a stratum of coal, may only have forced it to\r\na colder part of the same stratum; and thus, in separating it from one\r\nportion of carbonic matter, may have united it to another. Blind coal\r\nmay therefore be found where no bitumen has been actually extricated.\r\nIn like manner, bitumen may have been separated, where the coal was\r\nnot reduced to the state of coke, as a part of the bitumen only may\r\nhave been driven off, and enough left to prevent the coal from becoming\r\nabsolutely infusible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Geol. Essays, p. 473.]\r\n\r\nIt should be considered too, if the bitumen was really separated, and\r\nforced, in the state of vapour, into some argillaceous or limestone\r\nstratum, that this stratum may have been wasted and worn away long ago,\r\nso that the bitumen it contained may have entirely disappeared. It does\r\nnot therefore necessarily follow, that, wherever we find blind coal,\r\nthere also we should discover some of the purer bitumens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE X. § 37.\r\n\r\n                _The height above the level of the sea\r\n                     at which the marks of aqueous\r\n                      deposition are now found._\r\n\r\n\r\n177. We have two methods of determining the _minimum_ of the change\r\nwhich has happened to the relative level of the sea and land; or\r\nfor fixing a limit, which the true quantity of that change must\r\nnecessarily exceed. The one is, by observing to what height the regular\r\nstratification of mountains reaches above the present level of the sea;\r\nthe other is, by determining the greatest height above that level,\r\nat which the remains of marine animals are now found. Of these two\r\ncriteria, the first seems preferable, as the fact on which it proceeds\r\nis most general, and least subject to be affected by accidental causes,\r\nor such as have operated since the formation of the rocks. The results\r\nof both, however, if we are careful to select the extreme cases, agree\r\nmore nearly than could have been expected.\r\n\r\n178. The mountain Rosa, in the Alps, is entirely of stratified rocks,\r\nvery regularly disposed, and nearly horizontal.[86] The highest summit\r\nof this mountain is, by Saussure's measurement, 2430 toises, or 14739\r\nEnglish feet, above the level of the sea, or lower than the top of\r\nMont Blanc only by 20 toises, or 128 feet.[87] This is, I believe, the\r\nhighest point on the earth's surface, at which the marks of regular\r\nstratification are certainly known to exist; for though, by the account\r\nof the same excellent mineralogist, Mont Blanc itself is stratified,\r\nyet, as the rock is granite, the stratification vertical, and somewhat\r\nambiguous, it is much less proper than Monte Rosa for ascertaining the\r\nlimit in question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 2138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Ibid._ § 2135.]\r\n\r\n179. Again, in the new continent, we have an instance of shells\r\ncontained in a rock, not much lower than the summit of Monte Rosa.\r\nThis is one described by Don ULLOA, near the quicksilver mine of\r\nGuanca-Velica, in Peru. The height at which a specimen of these shells,\r\ngiven by Ulloa to M. Le GENTIL, was found, was 2222 1/3 toises, or\r\n14190 feet English, above the level of the seas.[88] This height agrees\r\nwith the preceding, within 549 feet, a quantity comparatively small.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: See Hist. Acad. des Sciences, 1770. Phys. Générale, No.\r\n7.]\r\n\r\n180. The last of the facts just mentioned is curiously commented on by\r\nMr Kirwan. As he has proved, he says, that the mountains higher than\r\n8500 feet were all formed before the creation of fish, it follows,\r\nthat the shells found at Guanca-Velica, must have been carried there\r\nby the deluge.[89] Now, without objecting to the proof here referred\r\nto, (though it seems very open to objection,) it is sufficient to\r\nremark, that, if the shells at Guanca-Velica were carried there by\r\nthe deluge, or any other cause that operated after the formation of\r\nthe rock of which the mountain consists, they can make no part of\r\nthat rock, but must lie, like other adventitious fossils, loose and\r\ndetached on the surface, or at most externally agglutinated to the\r\nstone. This, however, is certainly not the fact; for, in the account\r\njust quoted, we read, that Don Ulloa told M. le Gentil, \"qu'il avoit\r\ndétaché ces coquilles d'un banc fort épais.\" This seems plainly to\r\nindicate, that the shells were included in a bed of rock; But, granting\r\nthat the expression is a little ambiguous, on turning to the _Mémoires\r\nPhilosophiques_ of the same author, the difficulty is completely\r\nremoved, and it is made evident, that these shells are in fact\r\nintegrant parts of the rock. \"On voit dans ces montagnes-là, (about\r\nGuanca-Velica, and particularly at that in which is the quicksilver\r\nmine,) des coquilles entières, petrifiées et enfermées au milieu de la\r\nroche, que les eaux de pluie mettent à decouvert. Ces coquilles font\r\ncorps avec la pierre; mais malgré cela, on remarque que la partie qui\r\nfut coquille, se distingue par la couleur, la structure, la qualité de\r\nla matière de tout autre corps pierreux qui l'enferme, et du massif qui\r\ns'est fixé entre les deux ecailles,\"[90] &c. He goes on to say, that\r\none can distinguish marks of these shells having been worn, before they\r\nwere included in the stone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Geol. Essays, p. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Mém. Philosophiques de Don Ulloa, Discours xvi. vol. i.\r\np. 364.]\r\n\r\n181. Thus it appears, that whatever proof any fossil shell affords,\r\nthat the rock in which it is found was formed under the sea, the\r\nsame is afforded by the fossil shells of Guanca-Velica; and we are,\r\ntherefore, perfectly entitled to conclude, that the relative level of\r\nthe sea and land has changed, since the formation of the latter, by\r\nmore than 14000 feet. The height assumed in § 37 is therefore much\r\nunder the truth; and the water, for which the Neptunists must provide\r\nroom in subterraneous caverns, might very well have been stated at\r\nmore than a five-hundredth part of the whole mass of the earth.\r\n\r\nThus also the argument by which the Neptunists would connect the\r\ncreation of fish with the beginning of the secondary mountains, falls\r\nentirely to the ground. Indeed, it is strange that Mr Kirwan should\r\nhave supposed it possible, that the shells in question were loose and\r\nunconnected with the rock, and had continued so, ever since the deluge,\r\nin such elevated ground, where the torrents wear and cut down the\r\nmountains with unexampled violence, and have hollowed out _Quebradas_\r\nso much deeper and more abrupt than the glens or vallies among other\r\nmountains. He had not, I believe, seen the passage I have quoted from\r\nUlloa; but the circumstances did not warrant the shells in question to\r\nbe regarded as extraneous and adventitious fossils. A geologist should\r\nhave known better than to suppose this possible. When we see VOLTAIRE\r\nascribing to accidental causes the transportation of those shells\r\nwhich he had been told were often found among the Alps, we can excuse\r\nin a Poet and a Wit, that ignorance of the facts in mineralogy, which\r\nconcealed from him the extreme absurdity of his assertion; but when a\r\nChemist or Mineralogist talks and reasons in the same manner, we cannot\r\nconsider him as entitled to the same indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE XI. § 42.\r\n\r\n                       _Fracture and dislocation\r\n                            of the strata._\r\n\r\n\r\n182. The greatest part of the facts relative to the fracture and\r\ndislocation of the strata, belongs to the history of veins. The\r\ninstances of slips, where no new mineral substance is introduced\r\nbetween the separated rocks, are what properly belong to this place.\r\nThe frequency of these, and their great extent, are well known wherever\r\nmines have been wrought. In some of them no opening is left, but the\r\nslipped strata remain contiguous; in other cases, there is introduced\r\nan unconsolidated earth, often a clay, which may be supposed to have\r\ncome from above, arid very probably to have been carried down by the\r\nwater. In some such cases, however, there are not wanting appearances,\r\nwhich show the matter in the slip to have been forced up from below,\r\nas we find it to contain substances which could not have come from the\r\nsurface.[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Unconsolidated earth contained between the sides of\r\na rock that has slipped, is frequent in Cornwall, and is called a\r\n_Fleukan_. ]\r\n\r\n183. A very remarkable fact of this kind occurred not long ago, in\r\ndigging the Huddersfield canal in Yorkshire; and a very distinct\r\naccount of it is given in the _Philosophical Transactions_, by the\r\nengineer who directed the work. In carrying a tunnel into the heart of\r\na hill, the miners came to what is called in the description a _fault_,\r\n_throw_, or _break_, or what we have here called a shift, which was\r\nfilled with _shale_ set on edge, mixed with softer earth, and in some\r\nplaces with small lumps of coal. The fault or space filled with these\r\nmaterials, was in general about four yards broad, and lay nearly in\r\nthe direction of the tunnel, so that a considerable extent of it was\r\nvisible. Beside the shale, it contained a _rib_ of limestone, about\r\nfour feet thick, which run parallel to the sides of the _fault_, and\r\nabout four feet from the southern margin of it. On each side of this\r\nrib were found balls of limestone, promiscuously scattered, and of\r\nvarious sizes, from an ounce to one hundred pounds weight. The balls,\r\nwhen broken, were found to contain some pyrites near their edges; they\r\nwere not perfectly globular, but flattened on the opposite sides, and\r\nsimilar to one another.[92] At the time when the account was written,\r\nabout seventy yards of the rib had been discovered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Phil. Trans. 1796, p. 350.]\r\n\r\n184. Now, it is certain, that neither this rib of limestone, nor the\r\nballs that accompanied it, can have come from above, as there is no\r\nlimestone within twenty miles of the place where they were found. They\r\nmust, therefore, have been forced up from below, and no doubt belong\r\nto some limestone strata, which lie there at a great depth under the\r\nsurface. The length of this fragment of rock, which, from the account,\r\none must suppose to have been entire, conveys no mean idea, either of\r\nthe intensity or regularity of the force by which it was brought into\r\nits present situation. In veins, it is not uncommon to meet with stones\r\nthat appear to have come from a greater depth: but this is probably the\r\nmost remarkable instance of the same phenomenon, which has appeared in\r\na mere slip, and none, I think, can speak a language less liable to be\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n185. I shall here mention another mark of violent fracture, that has\r\nbeen observed in rocks of breccia or pudding-stone, which, though not\r\nof the same kind with the preceding, and of a nature quite peculiar,\r\nbelongs rather to this place than any other. In rocks of the kind,\r\njust mentioned, it sometimes happens, that considerable portions are\r\nseparated from one another, as if by a mathematical plane, which had\r\ncut right across all the quartzy pebbles in its way. None of the\r\npebbles are drawn out of their sockets, that is, out of the cement that\r\nsurrounds them, but are divided in two with a very smooth and even\r\nfracture. The pebbles, in the instances which I have seen, were of\r\nquartz, and other species of primary and much indurated rock.\r\n\r\nLord WEBB SEYMOUR and I observed pudding-stone rocks, exhibiting,\r\ninstances of this singular kind of fracture, near Oban, in Argyleshire,\r\nabout three years ago. The phenomenon was then entirely new to us both;\r\nbut I have since met with an instance of the same kind in Saussure's\r\nlast work. As the fact is of so particular a kind, I shall state it in\r\nhis own words: The place was on the sea shore, near the little town of\r\nAlassio, between Nice and Genoa.\r\n\r\n\"En passant entre ces blocs de breche, j'admirai quelques-uns\r\nd'entr'eux, d'une grandeur considérable, et taillés en cubes, avec\r\nla plus parfaite régularité. Il y avoit ceci de remarquable, c'est\r\nque l'action de la pesanteur, qui avoit taillé ces cubes en rompant\r\nleurs couches, avoit coupé tous les cailloux des breches à fleur de\r\nla surface de la pierre, aussi nettement que si c'eût été une masse\r\nmolle qu'on eût tranchée verticalement avec un rasoir. Cependant parmi\r\nces cailloux, la plupart calcaires, il s'en trouvoit de très durs, de\r\npetrosilex, par exemple, même de jade, qui étoient tranchées tout\r\naussi nettement que les autres.\"[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1731.]\r\n\r\n186. This description is no doubt accurate, though it involves in it\r\nsomething of theory, viz. that the fracture was made by the weight of\r\nthe stone. This may indeed be true: the operation probably belongs\r\naltogether to the surface, and is one with which the powers of the\r\nmineral regions are not directly concerned. The phenomenon, however,\r\nappears to me, on every supposition, very difficult to explain. In the\r\nspecimen which I brought from Oban, the smallest pieces of stone are\r\ncut in two, as well as the largest. The consolidation and hardness of\r\nthe mass are very great, and the connection of the different fragments\r\nso perfect, that it is no wonder the whole should break as one stone.\r\nBut still, that the fracture should be so exactly in one plane, and\r\nwithout any shattering, is not a little enigmatical; if it is indeed\r\na fracture, it must be the consequence of an immense impulse, very\r\nsuddenly communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE XII. § 43.\r\n\r\n                       _Elevation and inflection\r\n                            of the strata._\r\n\r\n\r\n187. The evidence of the different formation of the primary and\r\nsecondary strata, and of the changes which the former have undergone,\r\nis best seen at the points where those strata come into contact with\r\none another. Dr Hutton was not the first who observed these junctions,\r\nthough the first who rightly interpreted the appearances which they\r\nexhibit. He has mentioned observations of this sort by De Luc on the\r\nconfines of the Hartz; by the author of the _Tableau de la Suisse_,\r\nat the pass of Yetz; by Voight, in Thuringia; and Schreiber, at the\r\nmountain of Gardette.[94]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 410 to 453.]\r\n\r\nThe leading facts to be remarked, are,\r\n\r\nI. The vertical or very upright position of the primary or lower strata.\r\n\r\nII. The superstratification of the secondary, in a position nearly\r\nhorizontal, so as to be at right angles to those on which they rest.\r\n\r\nIII. The interposition of a breccia between them or, as happens in\r\nmany cases, the transition of the lowest of the secondary beds into a\r\nbreccia, containing fragments sometimes worn, sometimes angular, of the\r\nprimary rock.\r\n\r\nThis last is a phenomenon extremely general, and all our subsequent\r\ninformation confirms Dr Hutton's anticipations concerning it. \"It will\r\nbe very remarkable,\" he says, \"if similar appearances, (such as those\r\nof the breccia described by Voight,) are always found upon the junction\r\nof the Alpine with the level countries.\"[95] Saussure, in a part of his\r\nwork, not published when Dr Hutton wrote this passage, has attested the\r\ngenerality of the fact with respect to the whole Alps, from the Tyrol\r\nto the Mediterranean: \"Un sait que l'on observe sans aucune exception,\r\nce sont les amas de débris, sous la forme de blocs, de breches, de\r\npoudingues, de grès, de sable, ou amoncelés, et formant des montagnes,\r\nou des collines, dispersés sur le bord exterieur, ou même dans les\r\nplaines qui bordent la chaine des Alpes.\"[96]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 2330.]\r\n\r\nThis passage is perfectly decisive as to the generality of the fact,\r\nthat the Alps, from the Tyrol to the Mediterranean, are bordered all\r\nround by pudding-stones or breccias. At the same time, it is necessary\r\nto remark, that M. Saussure, by enumerating loose blocks and sand,\r\nalong with pudding-stones, breccias and grit, confounds together things\r\nwhich are extremely different, and which have had their origin at\r\nperiods extremely remote from one another. The consolidated rocks of\r\nbreccia, pudding-stone and grit, though they are indications of waste,\r\nhave received their present character at the bottom of the sea: the\r\nloose blocks of stone, the sand and gravel, on the other hand, are the\r\neffects of the waste now going forward on the surface of the land, and\r\nare the materials out of which rocks of the three kinds just mentioned\r\nmay hereafter be composed. If so skilful a mineralogist as Saussure\r\nis guilty of such inaccuracy, it must be ascribed to the confusion\r\nnecessarily arising from the system which he followed, and not to his\r\nown want of discrimination.\r\n\r\n188. The same phenomenon, of a breccia circumscribing the primary\r\nmountains, is met with in Scotland; and the Grampians, wherever they\r\nare bounded by secondary strata, whether on the south or north, afford\r\nexamples of it. The breccia generally consists of the fragments of\r\nthe primary rock, most commonly rounded, but sometimes also angular,\r\nunited by a cement of secondary formation, and the whole disposed\r\nin horizontal beds. It was on the constancy of this accompaniment\r\nof the primary strata, and on the great quantity of highly polished\r\ngravel often included in these breccias, that Dr Hutton grounded the\r\nhypothesis of the double raising up and letting down of the ancient\r\nstrata. See § 43.\r\n\r\n189. As the spots where the primary and secondary rocks may be seen\r\nin contact with one another are of great importance in geology, and\r\npresent to the senses the most striking monuments of the high antiquity\r\nand great revolutions of the globe, it may be useful to point out such\r\nof them as have been observed in this island. To those which Dr Hutton\r\nhas described, I have a few more to add, the result of some geological\r\nexcursions, which I made in company with the Right Honourable Lord\r\nWEBB SEYMOUR, to whose assistance I have been much indebted in the\r\nprosecution of these inquiries.\r\n\r\n190. The most southern junction which we observed is at Torbay, where\r\nthe ancient schistus which prevails along the coast, from the Land's\r\nEnd to that point, receives a covering of red horizontal sandstone,\r\nthe same which composes the greater part of Devonshire. The spot where\r\nthe immediate contact is visible, is on the shore, a little to the\r\nsouth of Paynton; and one circumstance, which among many others serves\r\nto distinguish the different formation of the two kinds of rock, is,\r\nthat the schistus, which is elevated here at an angle of about 45°, is\r\nfull of quartz veins, which veins are entirely confined to it, and do\r\nnot, in as far as we could observe, penetrate into the sandstone, in a\r\nsingle instance. It is probable, that on the north shore of the bay,\r\nthe same line of junction is visible: we saw it at Babicomb Bay, still\r\nmore to the northward.\r\n\r\n191. From this place, the secondary strata of different kinds prevail\r\nwithout interruption, along the coast of the British Channel, and\r\nof the German Ocean, as far as Berwick upon Tweed, and for some\r\nmiles beyond it. The sea coast then intersects a primary ridge, the\r\nLammermuir Hills, which traverses Scotland from east to west, uniting,\r\nnear the centre of the country, with the metalliferous range of\r\nLeadhills, and afterwards with the mountains of Galloway. The section\r\nwhich the sea coast makes of the eastern extremity of this ridge, is\r\nhighly instructive, from the great disturbance of the primary strata,\r\nand the variety of their inflections. The junction of these strata\r\nwith the secondary, on the south side, is near the little sea-port of\r\nEyemouth, but the immediate contact is not visible.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the ridge, the junction is at a point called the\r\n_Siccar_, not far from Dunglass, the seat of Sir James Hall, Baronet.\r\nBy being well laid open, and dissected by the working of the sea,\r\nthe rock here displays the relation between the two orders of strata\r\nto great advantage. Dr Hutton himself has described this junction;\r\n_Theory of the Earth_, vol. i. p. 464.\r\n\r\n192. From the point just mentioned, the secondary strata continue as\r\nfar as Stonehaven, where the southern chain of the Grampian mountains\r\nis intersected by the sea-coast. Here a great mass of pudding-stone\r\nappears to lie on the primary strata, but their immediate contact has\r\nnot been observed.\r\n\r\n193. Going along the coast toward the north, the next junctions which\r\nwe saw were on the shore, one near Gardenston, and another near Cullen,\r\nin Banffshire. The latter is very distinct; it is about a mile to the\r\nwestward of the rocks called _The Three Kings_, where a red sandstone,\r\nthe lower beds of which involve much quartzy gravel, lies horizontally\r\nupon very regular, upright, and highly indurated strata. Some of these\r\nstrata are micaceous, and others of the granulated quartz, mentioned in\r\n§ 153.\r\n\r\n194. This last is, I believe, the most northern junction which has\r\nbeen observed in our island. The western coast furnishes several more,\r\nwhich however are not all visible. The line of separation, between\r\nthe primary schistus of the Grampians and the sandstone which covers\r\nit, is intersected at its western extremity by the Frith of Clyde,\r\nnot far from Ardencaple in Dunbartonshire. The two kinds of stone can\r\nbe traced within a few yards of each other, but not to the actual\r\ncontact: the beds of sandstone nearest the schistus form as usual a\r\nbreccia, loaded with fragments of the primary rock. The secondary rock,\r\nwhich begins here, continues for about fifty miles south, to Girvan in\r\nAyrshire, where the primary schistus again rises up, but is not seen in\r\ncontact with the secondary. It extends to the Mull of Galloway and the\r\nshores of the Solway Frith.\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Arran, however, not far distant from this part of the\r\ncoast, contains a junction at its northern extremity, where secondary\r\nstrata of limestone lie immediately on a primary micaceous schistus.\r\nThis is described by Dr Hutton, and was the first phenomenon of the\r\nkind which he had an opportunity of examining.[97] The junction is\r\nvisible but at one spot, and is not seen so distinctly as in some of\r\nthe instances just mentioned; but the great quantity of pudding-stone\r\nnear it, renders it more interesting than it would be otherwise. As the\r\ngreater part of this little island is surrounded by secondary strata,\r\nother junctions might be expected to be visible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 429.]\r\n\r\n195. On the coast of England and Wales, from the Solway Frith to the\r\nLand's End, though there are several alternations from secondary to\r\nprimary strata, I know not that any of them have been observed. At St\r\nBride's Bay, in Pembrokeshire, the primary and secondary strata are\r\nseen very near their junction; but the precise line I believe is not\r\nvisible. The coal-pits in the secondary strata, approach here within a\r\nfew hundred yards of the primary. The secondary strata which commence\r\nat this place, occupy both sides of the Bristol Channel, and meet the\r\nCornish schistus, which extends across the north of Devonshire to the\r\nQuantock Hills, in a line that may be looked for on the sea coast, some\r\nwhere between Watchett and Minehead.\r\n\r\n196. Besides the sea coast, the beds of rivers may be expected to\r\nafford information on this subject. To the instances I have mentioned,\r\nI have accordingly two others from the inland country to be added. One\r\nof them is from the river Jed, a little way above Jedburgh, where the\r\nsecondary strata are seen lying horizontally on the primary, a section\r\nof both being made by the bed of the river. The phenomena here are very\r\ndistinct, and strongly marked; Dr Hutton has described and represented\r\nthem in a plate.[98] He has mentioned another junction, not far from\r\nthis, which he saw in the Tiviot. Both these belong to the same primary\r\nridge with the Siccar point.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 430; also plate 3.]\r\n\r\n197. I shall mention only one other, which was discovered by Lord Webb\r\nSeymour and myself, at the foot of the high mountain of Ingleborough,\r\nin Yorkshire. As we went along the Askrig road from Ingleton, about a\r\nmile and a half from the latter, an opening appeared in the side of\r\nthe hill, on the right, about one hundred yards from the road, formed\r\nby a large stone, which lay horizontally, and was supported by two\r\nothers, standing upright. On going up to the spot, we found it was the\r\nmouth of a small cave, the stone lying horizontally, being part of a\r\nlimestone bed, and the two upright stones, vertical plates of a primary\r\nargillaceous schistus. The limestone bed, which formed the roof of the\r\ncave, was nearly horizontal, declining to the south-east; the schistus\r\nnearly vertical, stretching from north-west by west, to south-east by\r\neast. The schistus, though close in contact with the limestone, seemed\r\nto contain nothing calcareous, and did not effervesce with acids in the\r\nslightest degree.\r\n\r\nAs this cave is at the foot of Ingleborough, a cold wind, 24° below the\r\ntemperature of the external air, which issued from the mouth of it,\r\nmight very well be supposed to come from the inmost recesses of that\r\nmountain. Ingleborough, which consists entirely of strata of limestone\r\nand grit, nearly horizontal, and alternating with one another, rises\r\nto the height of 1800 or 2000 feet above the spot where we now stood.\r\nThis, I believe, is the greatest thickness of secondary strata that\r\nhas ever been observed incumbent on the primary, and it is therefore\r\na geological fact highly deserving of attention. The country all\r\nround, to a very great extent, is composed of limestone, with a few\r\nbeds of grit interposed, and forming, beside Ingleborough, some other\r\nhigh mountains, such as Wharnside and Pennigant, all resting, it is\r\nprobable, on the same foundation.\r\n\r\nAt the spot just described, no breccia appeared to be interposed\r\nbetween the primitive and secondary rock; but we found a breccia at\r\nanother point of the same junction, not far distant. This was at a\r\ncascade, in the river Greta, called Thornton Force, about two miles\r\nand a half from the place just mentioned. The Greta here precipitates\r\nitself from a horizontal rock of limestone; and, after a fall of\r\nabout eighteen or twenty feet, is received into a bason which it has\r\nworked out in the primary schistus. This schistus is in beds almost\r\nperpendicular; it exactly resembles that which has Just been described,\r\nand stretches nearly in the same direction. On the south side of the\r\nriver a breccia was seen, lying upon the schistus, or rather, it might\r\nbe said, that the lowest beds of limestone contained in them many\r\nrounded fragments of stone, which, on comparison, resembled exactly\r\nthe schistus underneath. The primary rock itself is here seven or eight\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe same schistus, somewhat lower down the valley, and nearer to\r\nIngleton, appears in large quantities, and is quarried for slate. Here,\r\nhowever, the immediate junction of the limestone and schistus does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer on the description of these appearances than on\r\nany others of the same kind, because, from the great mass of secondary\r\nstrata which here covers the primary, the circumstances are such as we\r\ncannot expect to see very often exemplified.\r\n\r\n198. The Lakes of Cumberland are much visited by travellers; and it may\r\nbe worth remarking, on that account, that, as the site of these lakes\r\nis a patch of primary country, bounded on all sides by secondary, so,\r\nin the rivers that run from the lakes, such junctions as we are now\r\ntreating of may be expected to be found. Under Dun-Mallet, on the side\r\ntoward Ulles Water, we observed a breccia, which was in horizontal\r\nlayers, and seemed to lie on the primary schistus, so that the whole\r\nhill is perhaps a piece of more indurated breccia, or secondary rock,\r\nwhich has resisted the wearing and washing down of the rivers better\r\nthan the rest.\r\n\r\n199. After ascertaining the fact of the disturbance of the strata, and\r\ntheir removal from their original position, it is of consequence to\r\ninquire into the direction of the force by which these changes have\r\nbeen produced. Now, if the disturbed or elevated strata, were every\r\nwhere in planes, without bending or sinuosity, it might perhaps be\r\nhard to determine, whether that force had acted in the direction of\r\ngravity, or in the opposite. Either supposition would account for the\r\nappearances; and, as gravity is a known force, providing we can find\r\nsome place fit to receive the matter impelled downward by it, its\r\naction would furnish the most probable solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt is on this principle that the Neptunian system proceeds, imagining,\r\nthat certain great caverns or vacuities having been opened in the\r\ninterior of the globe, a great part of the waters which formerly\r\ncovered its surface, retired into them, and much of the solid rock also\r\nsunk down at the same time. In this way, one extremity of a stratum\r\nhas been elevated, while the other has been depressed, and a certain\r\ninclination to the horizon has been given to the whole of it. Thus one\r\ncause serves two purposes; the vacuities in the interior of the earth\r\naccount, both for the depression of the sea, and the elevation of the\r\nland; and the Neptunists, if the phenomena were all such as have been\r\nnow stated, might boast of a felicity of explanation, not very usual in\r\ntheir system.\r\n\r\nBut this appearance of success vanishes, when the elevation and\r\ndisturbance of the strata are more minutely examined, and are found\r\nto include waving and inflection, in a great variety of forms. It\r\nthen becomes evident, that the beds of rock, at the time when they\r\nwere disturbed from their horizontal position, had not their present\r\nhardness and rigidity, but were, in a certain degree at least, soft\r\nand flexible. Without these qualities, they could not have received,\r\nas they have often done, the curvature of a circle, not many feet,\r\nnay, not many inches, in diameter; nor could they have been bent into\r\nsuperficies, with their curvature in opposite directions, so that\r\nthe same surface is in one part convex, and in another concave, on\r\nthe same side, with a line of contrary flexure interposed. These are\r\nappearances, not reconcilable with the mere falling in, and breaking\r\ndown of indurated rocks.\r\n\r\n200. The inflections and wavings that we are here speaking of, though\r\nnot peculiar to the primary strata, are found most frequently among\r\nthem, and are perfectly familiar to every one who his travelled among\r\nmountains with any view to the study of geology. The following are a\r\nfew instances of this phenomenon out of a great number which might be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nSaussure, in describing the route from Geneva to Chamouni, mentions\r\nmany remarkable instances of the bending of the strata, and\r\nparticularly where the small stream of Nant d'Arpenaz forms a cascade,\r\nby falling over the face of a perpendicular limestone rock. The strata\r\nof this rock are bent into circular arches, extremely regular, and with\r\ntheir concavity turned to the left. What deserves particularly to be\r\nremarked, is, that a mountain behind the cascade has its strata bent\r\nin a direction opposite to the former, or with their concavity to the\r\nright. There is no doubt that the strata of both rocks are the same, so\r\nthat a vertical section of them would give a curve, in the figure of an\r\nS.[99] These circumstances are mentioned by Saussure, and from them we\r\nmay infer this other property of these strata, that their section by a\r\nhorizontal plane, must exhibit a system of straight lines, probably all\r\nparallel to one another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Voyages aux Alpes, vol i. § 472; also, Theory of the\r\nEarth, vol. ii. p. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe same mineralogist describes the calcareous strata which compose\r\nthe mountain Axenberg, on the side of the Lake of Lucerne, as having\r\nfrom top to bottom of the mountain the form of the letter S compressed,\r\n(_ecrasée_) with their curvature in some places very great. These\r\ninflections are repeated several times, and often in contrary\r\ndirections; the layers are sometimes broken, where their curvature is\r\ngreatest.[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1935.]\r\n\r\nOn the side of the same lake, is another instance of bent strata, in a\r\nmountain, of which the beds are horizontal in the lower part, but are\r\nbent at one end upwards, in the form of the letter C. The horizontal\r\npart is of great extent, and the rock is also calcareous,[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Ibid._ § 337.]\r\n\r\nThe Montagne de la Tuile, near Montmelian, receives its name from the\r\nbeds of rock being incurvated in form of a tyle.[102] Among secondary\r\nmountains, the same kind of phenomena are observed, though less\r\nfrequently, and with less variety of inflection. The chain of Jura is\r\nsecondary, and the beds which compose it are of limestone, or of grit:\r\nthey are bent in such a manner, that in a transverse section of the\r\nmountain, each layer would have the figure of a parabola.[103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Ibid._ vol. iii. § 1182, and plate i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Ibid._ tom. i. § 334.]\r\n\r\n201. The Pyrenees furnish abundance of phenomena of the same kind,\r\nas we learn from the _Essai sur la Mineralogie des Pyrenées_. The\r\ncalcareous strata of the valley of Aspe, represented plate v. of that\r\nwork, deserve particularly to be remarked.\r\n\r\n202. Our own island abounds with examples of the bending and inflection\r\nof the strata, especially the primary, and many of them very much\r\nresembling those in the Alps and Pyrenees. On the top of the mountain\r\nof _Ben-Lawers_, in Perthshire, there is a rock, the face of which\r\nexhibits a section of a great number of thin equidistant layers, bent\r\nbackwards and forwards like those described by Saussure; and this\r\nunequivocal proof of the rock having once existed in the state of a\r\nflexible and tenacious paste, is rendered more striking, by the great\r\nelevation of the spot, and the ruggedness and induration, both of\r\nthe stone itself, and of every thing that surrounds it. Many other\r\nmountains in this tract consist of a schistus, which is talcose rather\r\nthan micaceous, and subject, in a remarkable degree, to the sort of\r\nsinuosity and inflection here treated of.\r\n\r\nThe appearances of the primary strata on the coast of Berwickshire,\r\nhave been already mentioned, as affording much valuable instruction in\r\ngeology. They also exemplify the waving and inflection of the strata\r\non a large scale, and with great variety. A section of some of them\r\nis given by Dr Hutton, in his _Theory of the Earth_, vol. i. from a\r\ndrawing made by Sir James Hall. The nature of the curve superficies\r\ninto which the schistus is bent, is the better understood from this,\r\nthat, besides transverse sections from north to south, the deep\r\nindentures which the sea has made, and the projecting points of rock,\r\nexhibit many longitudinal sections, in a direction from east to west.\r\n\r\n203. The dock-yards at Plymouth are in several places cut out of a\r\nsolid rock of primary schistus, singularly incurvated. The inflections\r\nare seen there to great advantage, being exhibited in three sections,\r\nat right angles to one another, transverse, longitudinal and horizontal.\r\n\r\n204. From these instances, to which it were easy to add many more, two\r\nconclusions may be drawn. The first of these is very obvious, viz.\r\nthat the strata must have been pliant and soft when they acquired\r\ntheir present form. The bending of an indurated bed of stone into an\r\narch of great curvature, and without fracture, as in the preceding\r\nexamples, is a physical impossibility. Saussure has indeed observed a\r\nfracture to accompany the bending, in one or two cases; but it is an\r\nuncommon phenomenon, and, where it happens, must no doubt be understood\r\nto indicate an imperfect flexibility. Now, if it be granted that the\r\nstrata were at any time soft and flexible, since their complete\r\nformation, it will be found impossible to deny their having been\r\nsoftened by the application of heat.\r\n\r\n205. The second conclusion, alluded to above, results from a property,\r\nwhich belongs very generally, if not universally, to the inflections of\r\nthe strata. This consists in their curvature being simple, or in one\r\ndimension only, like a cylindric superficies, not double, or in two\r\ndimensions, like the superficies of a sphere or spheroid. This may be\r\notherwise expressed by saying, that the sections of the bent strata,\r\nby a horizontal plane, are straight lines, parallel to one another. On\r\nthis account, every such stratum seems as if it were bent over all axis\r\nand the axes of all these different bendings, for a great extent of\r\ncountry, are nearly parallel.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this is evident, where the strata are seen both\r\ntransversely and longitudinally. It holds remarkably of the primary\r\nschistus on the coast of Berwickshire; where the beds of rock, if\r\ncut transversely, by a vertical plane, exhibit the figures of very\r\ncomplicated curves, with various maxima and minima, and points of\r\ncontrary flexure; but, if they are cut by a horizontal plane, the\r\nsection will produce nothing but straight lines, nearly parallel.\r\n\r\n206. The constancy of the direction of the primary strata, when\r\nestimated by their intersection with the horizontal plane, is often\r\nvery remarkable. Their elevation and flexure are subject to great and\r\nsudden changes, so as to pass not only from greater to less, but from\r\none side to the opposite, within a small distance; but the horizontal\r\nline in which they _stretch_, usually preserves the same bearing\r\nto a great extent. The general direction of the primary strata, in\r\nthe south part of Scotland, is from E.N.E. to W.S.W.; and the same\r\nis nearly true of those which compose the ridge of the Grampians on\r\nthe north, and the hills of Cumberland and Westmoreland toward the\r\nsouth, though between the schistus of these three tracts, there is no\r\ncommunication at the surface, each being entirely separated from the\r\none next it, by the interposition of secondary strata. I have already\r\nmentioned the observations of Lord Webb Seymour and myself, at the\r\nfoot of Ingleborough; and it appears from them, that the vertical\r\nschistus on which that mountain rests, though it still preserves an\r\neastern and western direction, varies several points from that of the\r\nmore northern strata. The strata of Wales return more to the first\r\nmentioned direction, and those of Devonshire and Cornwall agree with\r\nit very nearly. In all this, it will be easily conceived, that I do\r\nnot mean to speak with absolute precision, or to deny the existence of\r\ngreat local irregularities. The result given is only a kind of average,\r\ndeduced from observations hardly susceptible of great exactness, and\r\nnot yet sufficiently multiplied to give to the conclusion all the\r\naccuracy it may attain.\r\n\r\n207. This tendency of the primary strata to take a uniform direction,\r\nhas also been observed in other countries. Saussure remarked in the\r\nAlps, that the beds of schistus are generally parallel to the chains of\r\nmountains composed of them;[104] and this remark is probably applicable\r\nto all mountains consisting of primary strata. The general direction,\r\ntherefore, of the schistus of the Alps, must be confined between W.\r\n10° S. and W. 40° S. In the Pyrenees, the direction of the strata is\r\nabout W.N.W.[105] If Saussure's rule may be depended on, the schistus\r\nof the Altaic, and most of the other great chains in the old continent,\r\nare in directions that run considerably to the south of west. The\r\nUrals, and perhaps some other of the northern chains, are however\r\nentirely different. In the Urals, as we learn not only from the general\r\ndirection of the chain, but from a section of it in the 10th volume of\r\nthe Nova Acta of Petersburgh (Tab. 12,) the direction of the strata is\r\nnearly from N. to S. This last is probably the direction in the great\r\nchains of South America; so that the uniformity of direction in the\r\nprimary strata, which some mineralogists would extend to those of the\r\nwhole earth, is certainly imaginary, though there can be no doubt that\r\nit extends over very large portions of the earth's surface.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Voyage aux Alpes, tom. i. § 577.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Essai sur la Mineralogie des Pyrenées.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: It is perhaps unnecessary to observe, that the two\r\npropositions, that the intersections of the strata with the horizon\r\nare parallel lines; and that they are lines which reserve the same\r\nbearing with respect to the points of the compass; are nearly the same\r\nthing for tracts of moderate extent, but for large portions of the\r\nearth's surface are extremely different. If, for instance, the belt\r\nof primary vertical schistus, which traverses the south of Scotland,\r\nwere to be produced eastward in the same plane, from its northern\r\nextremity, where its direction is E.N.E. and its latitude 55° 57', it\r\nwould cut the meridian always less obliquely as it advanced, till,\r\nhaving increased it longitude about 26° 28', it would be at right\r\nangles to the meridian, and its direction of consequence due east and\r\nwest. This would happen in the parallel of 58° 51', (on the shore of\r\nthe Gulf of Finland, near Revel,) the strata being now extended about\r\n880 G. miles from the Siccar Point. Conversely, vertical strata, having\r\nthe same bearing with respect to the meridian, may be in planes very\r\nmuch inclined to one another. A stratum which bears east and west in\r\nCornwall, and one that does the same at the east end of the Altaic,\r\nwill be in planes, which, if produced, would cut one another at right\r\nangles. All this is sufficiently plain from the doctrine of the\r\nsphere, and is mentioned here merely as a caution to prevent too hasty\r\nconclusions from being drawn from any correspondence of bearing among\r\nthe strata of remote countries.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of those who would deduce the medium bearing of any body\r\nof strata from a number of observations, it may be proper to take\r\nnotice, that the true average is not to be found by simply taking\r\nan arithimetical mean among all the observations. A more exact way\r\nis to work by the traverse table, as in keeping a ship's reckoning,\r\n(supposing the distance run to be always unity,) and to compute from\r\nthe observed bearings the amount of all the southing or northing, and\r\nalso all the easting and westing. The sum of all the latter, divided\r\nby the sum of all the former, is the tangent of the angle which the\r\ngeneral direction of the strata makes with the meridian.]\r\n\r\n208. The tendency of the primary strata to remain straight in the\r\nhorizontal direction, and to be bent in the vertical, is a phenomenon\r\nwhich points very directly to the causes from whence it has arisen. A\r\nsurface of simple curvature, or a surface straight in one direction,\r\nis what the application of forces to different points of a plane,\r\nwhich is flexible, though with a certain degree of rigidity, will\r\nnaturally produce. The supposition, therefore, that these strata were\r\nonce flat and horizontal, and were impelled upward from that situation\r\nbefore they had become rigid or hard, will explain their having the\r\nkind of curvature which removes them as little as possible from their\r\noriginal condition. But no other hypothesis affords any reason why\r\nthey should have that curvature more than any other. From the falling\r\nin of roofs of caverns, we might expect fracture and dislocation,\r\nwithout any order or regularity; but certainly no bending or sinuosity,\r\nnor any symmetrical arrangement. If, as some mineralogists allege,\r\nthe curvature, as well as inclination of the strata, arose from the\r\nirregularities of the bottom on which they were deposited, why is the\r\nformer in one dimension only, and why is it not in every direction,\r\nlike that of hills and valleys, or the actual surface of the earth?\r\nOr, lastly, if the whole structure of the primitive mountains is an\r\neffect of crystallization, and if these mountains are now such as\r\nthey have ever been from the time of their consolidation, whence is\r\nit, that, in their bendings the law just mentioned is so constantly\r\nobserved? Indeed, the idea of ascribing the inflections of the strata\r\nto crystallization, though suggested by Saussure,[107] and since\r\nbecome a favourite system with several mineralogists, appears to me\r\nin the highest degree unsatisfactory and illusive. The purpose for\r\nwhich crystallization is here introduced, is not to give a specific\r\nfigure to a particular substance, but to arrange the substances which\r\nit has formed and figured, according to certain rules; a work which\r\nwe know not how it is to perform, and in which we have no experience\r\nof its power. Accordingly, this principle does not account, in any\r\nway whatever, for the circumstances which attend the inflection of\r\nthe strata, for the simple curvature which they affect, nor for that\r\nparallelism of their layers, which, in all their bendings, is so\r\naccurately preserved. It does, indeed, so little serve to explain\r\nthese facts, that, were the appearances completely reversed; did the\r\nstrata assume the most complex, instead of the most simple curvature;\r\ninstead of equidistant, were they converging, or alternately receding\r\nand approaching to one another; the theory of crystallization might\r\nbe equally applied to them. The state of the phenomena is a matter of\r\nperfect indifference to such a theory as this; all things are explained\r\nby it with the same facility; the straight and the crooked, the square\r\nand the round, the moveable and the immoveable. Is it not evident that\r\nsuch an explanation is a mere word; or, if any thing more than a word,\r\nan expression of our ignorance, so awkward and indirect, as to deprive\r\nus of whatever credit might have been gained by a plain and candid\r\navowal of it?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. i. § 475.]\r\n\r\nIt should never be forgotten, that a theory which accounts for _any\r\nthing_, and a theory which accounts for _nothing_, stand precisely\r\non the same footing, and ought to be banished from all parts of\r\nphilosophy, as they have been from those sciences which are justly\r\nhonoured with the name of accurate. The animated orbs of Aristotle,\r\nand the vortices of Des Cartes, have long ceased to be mentioned in\r\nphysical astronomy; the first, because, they accounted for every thing\r\nalike; the second, because, when they accounted for one thing, they\r\nnever could be made to account for another. Both theories, therefore,\r\nhave very properly been rejected; and, when geology shall undergo a\r\nsimilar purification, the principle we have been considering will not\r\nbe the only sacrifice required of the Neptunian system.\r\n\r\n209. An appearance observed in some kinds of primary schistus, which\r\nclearly indicates their deposition by water, and in planes very\r\ndifferent from those in which we now see them, though it might have\r\nbeen introduced before, is also much connected with the present\r\nargument. This appearance consists of small wavings or undulæ on the\r\nsurface of the plates of schistus, precisely similar to these marks\r\nwhich are left by the sea on a gently inclining beach of sand, at the\r\nebbing of the tide. All the species of schistus do not seem to afford\r\ninstances of these wavings. The rocks which do so, are, I think,\r\nchiefly of the argillaceous kind, but often highly indurated; so that\r\nthe laminæ containing the impressions are not to be torn asunder but\r\nwith great difficulty. Instances of it abound in the schistus of\r\nBerwickshire, and are also not unfrequent in that of Galloway. All must\r\nagree about the agent which produced these marks; it could be no other\r\nthan the sea; but it must have been the sea acting on loose, small and\r\nround particles, lying on a surface which was nearly horizontal.\r\n\r\n210. Dr Hutton's theory is no where stronger, than in what relates\r\nto the elevation and inflection of the strata; points in which all\r\nothers are so egregiously defective. The phenomena to be connected\r\nare here extremely various, and even in appearance contradictory:\r\nthe horizontally of one part of the strata; the inclined or vertical\r\nposition of another; the perfect planes in which one set are extended;\r\nthe breaking and dislocation found in a second; the inflection and\r\nsinuosity of a third; and almost every where the utmost rigidity and\r\ninduration, combined with appearances of the greatest softness and\r\nflexibility; the preservation of a parallelism of superficies in the\r\nmidst of so much irregularity, and the assumption of a determinate\r\nspecies of curvature, under circumstances the most dissimilar; all\r\nthese appearances were to be connected with one another, and with\r\nthe consolidation of the strata, and this is done by the twofold\r\nhypothesis, of aqueous deposition, and the action of subterraneous\r\nheat. When these circumstances are fairly considered, and when the\r\nshifts which other systems are put to on this occasion are remembered,\r\nI think it will be granted, that few attempts at generalization have\r\nbeen more successful, than that which has been made by the Huttonian\r\nTheory.\r\n\r\n211. To the fact of the elevation of the strata, the study of geology\r\nis much indebted. The stratified form of a great proportion of the\r\nearth's surface, gives to minerals that organization and regularity,\r\nwhich makes their disposition an object of science, and their inclined\r\nposition serves to bring that organization into view, from far greater\r\ndepths than we can ever reach by artificial excavations. If, for\r\ninstance, the termination of strata, that make with the horizon an\r\nangle of 30°, lying one over another, is seen for a horizontal distance\r\nof two miles; then it is certain, that if these strata have that extent\r\nunder ground, which may be reasonably supposed, the thickness of the\r\nwhole mass, measured by a line perpendicular to its stratification, is\r\nhalf the horizontal distance, or amounts to one mile. It would also\r\nrequire a pit to be sunk from the uppermost of these strata, to the\r\ndepth of (2 miles × tan 30°, =) 6093 feet before it could intersect the\r\nundermost; and therefore, if we suppose the same stratum to preserve\r\nthe same character for the extent of some miles, we obtain the same\r\ninformation from inspecting the edge-seams, and see in reality as far\r\ninto the bowels of the earth, as if we had sunk a perpendicular shaft\r\nto the depth of 6000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn general, the length of the horizontal line drawn across the strata,\r\nfrom the lowest in position to the highest, multiplied into the sine of\r\nthe inclination of the strata to the horizon, gives the thickness of\r\nthe whole, measured perpendicularly to the plane of the stratification:\r\nand the same horizontal distance, multiplied into the tangent of the\r\ninclination, gives the actual depth at which the lowest stratum would\r\nmeet a perpendicular to the horizon, drawn from the highest extremity\r\nof the upper stratum.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the extent of stratified materials admitting of such\r\nan examination as this, is much greater than has now been supposed.\r\nM. Pallas describes a range of hills on the south-east side of the\r\npeninsula of the Tauride, which is cut down perpendicularly toward the\r\nsea, and offers a complete section of the parallel beds of a primary,\r\nor, as he calls it, an ancient limestone, inclined at an angle of\r\n45° to the horizon; and this section continues for the length of 130\r\n_versts_, or about 86 English miles. The beds are so regular, that M.\r\nPallas compares them to the leaves of a book.[108] The height of these\r\nhills does not exceed 1200 feet, but the real height of the uppermost\r\nstratum above the undermost, is 86 × √1/2 = 86 × 5/7 = 61 miles nearly.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: See Nova Acta Acad. Petropol. tom. x. (1792,) p. 257.]\r\n\r\nIf therefore we conceive that there is no shift in all this great\r\nsystem of strata, we in reality are enabled, by means of it, to see no\r\nless than 61 miles into the interior of the earth, nearly a 65th part\r\nof the radius of the globe. It is true, that we can hardly suppose so\r\ngreat a body of strata to have been raised without shifting, so that\r\nwe must diminish this depth considerably; but were it reduced even to\r\none-half it will appear, that men see much farther into the interior\r\nof the globe than they are aware of, and that geologists are reproached\r\nwithout reason for forming theories of the earth, when all that they\r\ncan do is but to make a few scratches on its surface. Art indeed can do\r\nlittle more; but nature supplies the deficiency, and makes discoveries\r\nto the attentive observer, on the same great scale with her other\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe simplest account that can be given of the vast body of parallel and\r\nhighly inclined strata just mentioned, is, that it consists of the ends\r\nof horizontal strata, or of strata not greatly inclined, that have been\r\nforced up when they were all soft and flexible. This is a much more\r\nconceivable supposition than Pallas's, viz. that the greater part of\r\nthis mass has sunk down into some vast cavern in the interior of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XIII. § 53.\r\n\r\n                           _Metallic Veins._\r\n\r\n\r\n212. The large specimens of native iron found in Siberia and Peru,\r\nmentioned above, § 51, are among the most curious facts in the natural\r\nhistory of metals. It has been doubted, however, by some, whether they\r\nreally belong to natural history, or are not rather to be accounted\r\nartificial productions. If they had been found in the heart of rocks,\r\nor in the midst of metallic veins, no doubt of this sort could possibly\r\nhave been entertained; but, as they lie quite on the surface, in the\r\nmiddle of flat countries, and at a distance from any known vein of\r\nmetal, the conjecture that they may be artificial, and the remains of\r\nthe iron founderies of ancient and unknown nations, is at first sight\r\nnot entirely destitute of probability. This probability, however, will\r\nappear to be the less, the more carefully the specimens are examined.\r\nThe metal is too perfect, and the masses too large, to have been melted\r\nin the furnaces, or to have been transported by the machinery, of a\r\nrude people. The specimen in South America weighs 300 quintals, or\r\nabout 15 tons, and is soft and malleable.[109] The Siberian specimen,\r\ndescribed by Pallas, is also very large; it is soft and malleable, and\r\nfull of round cavities, containing a substance, which, on examination,\r\nhas been found to be chrysolite.[110] Now, it is certainly quite\r\nimpossible, that, in an artificial fusion, so much chrysolite could\r\nhave come by any means to be involved in the iron; but, if the\r\nfusion was natural, and happened in a mineral vein, the iron and the\r\nchrysolite were both in their native place, and their meeting together\r\nhas nothing in it that is inexplicable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Phil. Trans. 1788, p. 37. also p. 183, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Kirwan's Mineralogy, vol. ii. art. Native Iron.]\r\n\r\n213. Some circumstances in the description of the specimen in South\r\nAmerica, such as the impressions of the feet of men and of birds on its\r\nsurface, are not to be accounted for on any hypothesis, and certainly\r\nrequire more careful investigation. It is said, that this iron is\r\nvery little subject to rust, and the analysis of a piece of it by\r\nPROUST makes it probable, that it owes this quality to its union with\r\nnickel.[111] It appears, also, that the country of Chaco, where this\r\nspecimen was found, affords many others of the same kind, one of which\r\nis mentioned in the description above referred to. That country lies\r\non the east side of the Plata, and is a plain extremely level, and of\r\nvast extent, without any appearance of mineral veins; but such veins\r\nmay nevertheless exist undiscovered, in a tract subject to periodical\r\ninundations, and where the native rock is covered with alluvial earth\r\nand gravel to a great depth. The veins maybe washed away, and the more\r\ndurable substances, such as those pieces of native iron, may be left\r\nbehind; and, though they must be of a formation extremely ancient,\r\naccording to this hypothesis, they may not have been very long on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Annales de Chimie, tom. xxxv. Messidor, p. 47.]\r\n\r\n214. Specimens of native iron have been found, less remarkable than\r\nthe preceding for their size, but in circumstances that excluded\r\nall idea of artificial fusion. Of this sort was MARGRAAF'S specimen\r\nof native iron, the first of the kind that was known; it consisted\r\nof small bits of soft and malleable iron, found in the heart of a\r\nbrown iron-stone.[112] This makes it certain, that native iron is a\r\nnatural production, and the mere circumstance of great magnitude, in\r\nthe specimens before mentioned, does not entitle us to doubt of their\r\nhaving that same origin. It is a circumstance, besides, not in the\r\nleast material to this argument; the smallest piece of native iron\r\nbeing as much a proof of fusion as the greatest; and the specimen\r\nof Margraaf being just as conclusive in favour of the Huttonian\r\nTheory, as those of Pallas or De Celis, supposing their reality in\r\nmineral productions to be completely established. À metal malleable\r\nand ductile, in ever so small a quantity, cannot be the result of\r\nprecipitation from a menstruum, without a very particular combination\r\nof circumstances. Such a metal, can the other hand, can be readily\r\nproduced by igneous fusion; so that here the negative and affirmative\r\nparts of the inductive argument may both be regarded as complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Kirwan's Mineralogy, vol. ii. p. 156.]\r\n\r\n215. Mr Kirwan, in order to account for the magnitude of the two large\r\nspecimens mentioned above, supposes, that small pieces of native iron\r\n(about the formation of which he appears to have no difficulty) have\r\nbeen originally agglutinated by petroleum, and left bare, when the\r\nsurrounding stony or earthy masses either withered or were washed\r\noff.[113] This is no doubt the most singular of all the opinions which\r\nhave been advanced on the subject; and, as it borrows nothing from\r\nanalogy, it admits of no proof, and requires no refutation. None but a\r\nchemist of eminence could have ventured with impunity on an assertion\r\nso inconsistent with all the phenomena and principles of his science.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Geol. Essays, p. 405.]\r\n\r\n216. A remark of the same author, on the subject of the native gold\r\nfound in the county of Wicklow in Ireland, is entitled to more\r\nattention. \"That these lumps of native gold,\" he says, \"were never in\r\nfusion, is evident from their low specific gravity, and the grains of\r\nsand found in the midst of them. I found the specific gravity of a lump\r\nof the size of a nutmeg to be only 12800, whereas, after fusion, it\r\nbecame 18700.\"[114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: _Ibid._ p. 402.]\r\n\r\nThis argument is plausible; but, I think, nevertheless inconclusive.\r\nThe sand found in the gold, accounts, at least in part, for its\r\nlightness. It is only by repeated fusions that any of the metals is\r\nbrought to its utmost purity and highest specific gravity; and on no\r\nsupposition can the melting of gold in the mineral regions, be very\r\nlikely to separate it from heterogeneous substances. That quartzy\r\nsand should be found in it, after such a process, is naturally to be\r\nexpected. The impressions which the quartz crystals have left on the\r\nWicklow gold, would be received as a full proof of the fusion of that\r\nmetal, if geologists always regulated their theories by the principles\r\nwhich determine the belief of ordinary men.\r\n\r\n217. Don Rubin de Celis, in the paper referred to above, mentions some\r\nmasses of silver found at Quantajaia, and also some dust of platina, in\r\nterms that excite a strong desire to have more information concerning\r\nthem. They are considered by him as effects of volcanic fire; so we\r\nmay conclude, that they contain evident marks of fusion, and would in\r\nthis system be ascribed to that heat, from which volcanic fire is but a\r\npartial and accidental derivation.\r\n\r\n218. The state also in which gold and silver are often found pervading\r\nmasses of quartz, and shooting across them in every direction,\r\nfurnishes a strong argument for the igneous origin, both of the metal\r\nand the stone. From such specimens, it is evident, that the quartz\r\nand the metal crystallized, or passed from a fluid to a solid state,\r\nat the same time; and it is hardly less clear, that this fluidity did\r\nnot proceed from solution in any menstruum: For the menstruum, whether\r\nwater or the _chaotic fluid_, to enable it to dissolve the quartz,\r\nmust have had an alkaline impregnation; and, to enable it to dissolve\r\nthe metal, it must have had, at the same time, an acid impregnation.\r\nBut these two opposite qualities could not reside in the same subject;\r\nthe add and alkali would unite together, and, if equally powerful,\r\nform a neutral salt, (like sea-salt,) incapable of acting either on\r\nthe metallic or the siliceous body. If the acid was most powerful, the\r\ncompound salt might act on the metal, but not at all upon the quartz;\r\nand if the alkali was most powerful, the compound might act on the\r\nquartz, but not at all on the metal. In no case, therefore, could it\r\nact on both at the same time. Fire or heat, if sufficiently intense,\r\nis not subject to this difficulty, as it could exercise its force with\r\nequal effect on both bodies.\r\n\r\n219. The simultaneous consolidation of the quartz and the metal is\r\nindeed so highly improbable, that the Neptunists rather suppose, that\r\nthe ramifications in such specimens as are here alluded to, have been\r\nproduced by the metal defusing itself through _rifts_ already formed\r\nin the stone.[115] But it may be answered, that between the channels\r\nin which the metal pervades the quartz, and the ordinary cracks or\r\nfissures in stones, there is no resemblance whatever: That a system of\r\nhollow tubes, winding through a stone, (as the tubes in question, must\r\nhave been, according to this hypothesis, before they were filled by\r\nthe metal,) is itself far more inconceivable than the thing which it\r\nis intended to explain; and lastly, that if the stone was perforated\r\nby such tubes, it would still be infinite to one that they did not all\r\nexactly join, or inosculate with one another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Geol. Essays, p. 401.]\r\n\r\n220. The compenetration, as it may be called, of two heterogeneous\r\nsubstances, has here furnished a proof of their having been melted by\r\nfire. The inclusion of one heterogeneous substance within another,\r\nas happens among the spars and drusens, found so commonly in mineral\r\nveins, often leads to a similar conclusion. Thus, from a specimen of\r\nchalcedony, including in it a piece of calcareous spar, Dr Hutton\r\nhas derived a very ingenious and satisfactory proof, that these two\r\nsubstances were perfectly soft at the same time, and mutually affected\r\neach other at the moment of their concretion.[116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 93.]\r\n\r\nEach of these substances has its peculiar form, which, when left to\r\nitself, it naturally assumes; the spar taking the form of rhombic\r\ncrystals, and the chalcedony affecting a mammalated structure, or a\r\nsuperficies composed of spherical segments, contiguous to one another.\r\nNow, in the specimen under consideration, the spar is included in the\r\nchalcedony, and the peculiar figure of each is impressed on the other;\r\nthe angles and planes of the spar are indented into the chalcedony,\r\nand the spherical segments of the chalcedony are imprinted on the\r\nplanes of the spar. These appearances are consistent with no notion of\r\nconsolidation that does not involve in it the simultaneous concretion\r\nof the whole mass; and such concretion cannot arise from precipitation\r\nfrom a solvent, but only from the congelation of a melted body. This\r\nargument, it must be remarked, is not grounded on a solitary specimen,\r\n(though if it were it might still be perfectly conclusive,) but on a\r\nphenomenon of which there are innumerable instances.\r\n\r\n221. According to this theory, veins were filled by the injection of\r\nfluid matter from below; and this account of them, which agrees so\r\nwell with the phenomena already described, is confirmed by this, that\r\nnothing of the substances which fill the veins is to be found any where\r\nat the surface. It is not with the veins as with the strata, where, in\r\nthe loose sand on the shore, and in the shells and corals accumulated\r\nat the bottom of the sea, we perceive the same materials of which these\r\nstrata are composed. The same does not equally hold of metallic veins:\r\n\"Look,\" says Dr Huston, \"into the sources of our mineral treasures? Ask\r\nthe miner from whence has come the metal in his veins? Not from the\r\nearth or air above, not from the strata which the vein traverses: these\r\ndo not contain an atom of the minerals now considered. There is but\r\none place from whence these minerals may have come; this is the bowels\r\nof the earth; the place of power and expansion; the place from whence\r\nhas proceeded that intense heat, by which loose materials have been\r\nconsolidated into rocks, as well as that enormous force, by which the\r\nregular strata have been broken and displaced.\"[117]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 130.]\r\n\r\n222. The above is a very just and natural reflection; but if, instead\r\nof interrogating the miner; we consult the Neptunist, we will receive\r\na very different reply. As this philosopher never embarrasses himself\r\nabout preserving a uniformity in the course of nature, he will tell\r\nus, that though it may be true, that neither the air, the upper part\r\nof the earth's surface, nor even the sea, contain at present any thing\r\nlike the materials of the veins, yet the time was when these materials\r\nwere all mingled together in the chaotic mass, and constituted one\r\nvast fluid, encompassing the earth; from which fluid it was, that the\r\nminerals were precipitated and deposited in the clefts and fissures of\r\nthe strata.\r\n\r\n223. It is alleged, in proof of this hypothesis, that mineral veins are\r\nfound to be less rich as they go farther down, whereas they ought to\r\nbe richer if they were filled by the projection of melted matter from\r\nbelow. But the fact, that mines are less rich as they descend farther,\r\nthough it may hold in some instances, is not general, and may therefore\r\nbe supposed to arise from local causes, such as are, in respect of us,\r\naccidental, and beyond the limits to which our theories can be expected\r\nto reach. Thus the mines of Mexico and Peru are said to be subject\r\nto the preceding rule; but in the mines of Derbyshire and Cornwall,\r\nthe very contrary is understood to take place. Besides, what we are\r\npleased to call the riches of a mine, are riches relatively to us, and\r\nrelatively to a distinction which nature does not recognise. The spars\r\nand veinstones which are thrown out in the rubbish of our mines, may be\r\nas precious in the eyes of nature, as conducive to the great objects\r\nof her economy, and are certainly as characteristic of mineral veins,\r\nas the ores of silver or gold, to which we attach so great a value.\r\nUnless the former are in smaller quantity, or less highly crystallized\r\nat great than at small depths, which I believe is not alleged, no\r\nconclusion can be drawn from substances, which occupy in general but a\r\nsmall proportion of any vein, and, in their dissemination through it,\r\ndo not seem to be always guided by the same law.\r\n\r\n224. Again, if the veins were filled by deposition from above, we ought\r\nto discover in them such horizontal stratification as is the effect of\r\ndeposition from water, and we should perceive no marks of the materials\r\nhaving been introduced with violence into their place. The Neptunists\r\ncannot object to the trial of their theory by these two frets.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, it is acknowledged, that there is a certain regular\r\ndisposition of the substances in mineral veins, as stated § 59, but it\r\nis one which has hardly any thing in common with the real phenomena\r\nof stratification. It consists in the distribution of the principal\r\nsubstances in coats parallel to the sides of the vein, each substance\r\nforming a separate coat. In a vein, for instance, containing quartz,\r\nfluor, calcareous spar, lead, &c. we might expect to find a lining of\r\nquartz crystals, applied immediately to the walls of the mine, and\r\nfollowing exactly the irregularities of their surface; next, perhaps,\r\na coat of fluor, then of calcareous spar, and last of lead ore in the\r\ncentre of the vein, the same order being observed on the opposite\r\nside. These successive coats, it is material to remark, are not in\r\nplanes, but in uneven surfaces, of which the inequalities are evidently\r\ndetermined by those of the walls, that is, of the rock which forms\r\nthe sides of the vein; neither are they horizontal, but are parallel\r\nto the walls, whether these be perpendicular or inclined. Here,\r\ntherefore, there is no appearance of the action of that statical law\r\nwhich has directed the arrangement of the other strata, and which tends\r\nto make the plane of every stratum deposited by water perpendicular\r\nto the direction of gravity. The coating of the veins has therefore\r\nbeen performed under the conduct of some other power than that which\r\npresides over aqueous deposition. If, as the Neptunists maintain, the\r\nmaterials in the veins were deposited by water, in the most perfect\r\ntranquillity, it is wonderful that we do not find those materials\r\ndisposed in horizontal layers, across the vein, instead of being\r\nparallel to its sides; and it seems very unaccountable, that the common\r\nstrata, deposited as we are told while the water was in a state of\r\ngreat agitation, have so rigorously obeyed the laws of hydrostatics, (§\r\n38.) and acquired a parallelism in the planes of their stratification,\r\nwhich approaches so often to geometrical precision; while the materials\r\nof the veins, in circumstances so much more favourable for doing the\r\nsame, have done nearly the reverse, and taken a position, often at\r\nright angles to that which hydrostatical principles require. This is a\r\nparadox which the Neptunian system has created, and which therefore it\r\nis not very likely to resolve.\r\n\r\n225. Mere words should have little power to mislead, in a science which\r\ntreats of sensible objects, such as are always easily subjected to the\r\nexamination of sight or of touch; yet there is some appearance as if\r\nthe Neptunists were misled in this, and other instances, by the term\r\n_stratification_. Though an incrustation on the perpendicular face of a\r\nrock has very little affinity to a stratum, such as we are accustomed\r\nto see deposited by water, yet the same name being once imposed on\r\nboth, mineralogists have proceeded to reason concerning them, as if\r\nthey were precisely the same thing, and were both to be ascribed to\r\nthe same cause. Indeed every perpendicular or highly inclined bed of\r\nstone, is inexplicable as an effect of aqueous deposition, in a system,\r\nunprovided, as the Neptunian is,[118] with the means of raising up\r\nsuch beds from a horizontal into a vertical position. This observation\r\nmay also be extended to all cases of vertical stratification. Water\r\ncannot directly arrange its deposits in planes highly inclined, and\r\ntherefore I have often wondered to see the Neptunists contending so\r\neagerly for the stratification of certain rocks, such as granite,\r\nwhich, being vertical, or highly inclined, was much less friendly to\r\ntheir system than the entire absence of all stratification would have\r\nbeen. I was disposed to admire their candour, when the use which\r\nthey made of the fact convinced me, that I ought only to wonder at\r\ntheir inconsequential reasoning. The Huttonian Theory is, indeed, the\r\nonly one which possesses the means of reconciling the elevation of\r\nthe strata with their horizontal deposition, and which is entitled to\r\nconsider stratification, in whatever plane it may be, as originally the\r\nwork of the ocean. The geologists who attach themselves exclusively to\r\nthe action of water, will never be able to extend the dominion of that\r\nelement so far as Dr Hutton has done, by combining it with fire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: See preceding note.]\r\n\r\n226. But, though the Neptunian system were provided with engines,\r\npowerful enough to raise up strata from a level to a vertical plane,\r\nthis would avail nothing in the present instance; since, on no\r\nsupposition, can the incrustations on the perpendicular sides of a\r\nvein have ever been horizontal. On no supposition, therefore, can\r\nthese incrustations be received as a proof of aqueous deposition: it\r\nmay indeed be certainly inferred from them, that the matter which they\r\nconsist of was fluid at the time of their formation; but the absence of\r\nall appearance of a horizontal disposition, in any part of the vein,\r\namounts nearly to a demonstration, that this fluidity did not proceed\r\nfrom solution in a menstruum. We must therefore conceive the coats\r\nto have been formed during the refrigeration of the melted matter\r\ninjected from the mineral regions into the clefts and fissures of the\r\nstrata. (§ 59.)\r\n\r\n227. Mineral veins, particularly at their intersections with one\r\nanother, contain abundant marks of the most violent and repeated\r\ndisturbance (§ 56.). Not to mention that they owe their first formation\r\nto the fracture and displacing of rocks already consolidated, it\r\nappears, that they have originated at very different periods, and that\r\nthe birth of each has been accompanied with convulsions, which shook\r\nthe foundations of the earth. In Cornwall, for instance, the principal\r\nveins, and those which they distinguish particularly by the name of\r\n_Lodes_, have nearly the same direction with the strata or vertical\r\nschistus, extending from about E. N. E. to W. S. W. These, however,\r\nare often intersected nearly at right angles by other mineral veins,\r\ncalled _Cross Courses_, and this hardly ever happens without the latter\r\nmoving, or, as it is called, heaving the former out of their direction.\r\nThis plainly indicates, that the cross courses are of later origin\r\nthan the others, and that their formation was accompanied with such a\r\nforce, as must, in many substances, have moved the whole body of rock\r\nwhich constitutes the promontory of Cornwall, and probably much more,\r\nfor several yards, in a horizontal direction. Sometimes, also, both\r\nthe longitudinal and the cross vein are forced out of their place by\r\na third. These disturbances arise not only from mineral veins, but\r\nfrom veins of porphyry and granite, the production of which has been\r\nattended with no less violence than of the others.\r\n\r\n228. What is here said of Cornwall, is the history, in some degree,\r\nof all mineral countries whatever. The great horizontal _translation_\r\nwhich has thus accompanied the formation of veins; the movement\r\nimpressed on such vast bodies of rock, and the frequent renewal of\r\nthese immense convulsions; are not to be explained by the mild and\r\ntranquil dominion of the watery element. They require the utmost power\r\nthat is known any where to exist, and were it not for the admonitions\r\nof the volcano and the earthquake, we might doubt if even subterraneous\r\nheat itself possessed an energy adequate to these astonishing effects.\r\n\r\n229. From the _heaving_ of one vein by another, it is evident, that\r\nthere was a force of protrusion in the direction of one of them, that\r\nacted at the time of its formation. This force cannot be accounted\r\nfor on the supposition that veins were produced by the mere shrinking\r\nof the strata; for the rocks could not, in that case, have been rent\r\nasunder, and impelled forward at the same time. It appears most likely,\r\nthat fissures in the strata were made, at least in many instances,\r\nand the matter poured into them, nearly at the same time, both being\r\neffects of the same cause, the expansive force of subterraneous heat.\r\n\r\n230. It is remarked, at § 56, that the shifting of the strata is best\r\nobserved where the veins make a transverse section of beds of rock,\r\nconsiderably inclined to the horizon. It is also true, that in some\r\ncases the near approach of the strata to the level, may make the shifts\r\nproduced by the veins very easy to be discovered. Thus in Derbyshire,\r\nwhere the mineral veins are in secondary strata, nearly horizontal,\r\nthere is almost no instance in which the corresponding strata are not\r\nobserved to be on different levels, on the opposite sides of the same\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n231. The fact described by De Luc, and referred to at § 55, may, for\r\nwhat we know of it, admit of being explained in two ways. The great\r\nwedge of rock which appears to be insulated between two branches of the\r\nsame vein, may either be a mass that has been broken off, and sustained\r\nby the melted matter that flowed all around it; or, it may be a mass\r\nof rock contained between two veins that are in reality distinct, and\r\nof different formation. Whether this last supposition is the truth,\r\nwould probably be evident from a careful examination of both parts\r\nof the vein; as some difference of character cannot fail to be the\r\nconsequence of different formation. If no such difference is observed,\r\nthe two branches must be supposed to belong to the same vein, and the\r\nonly probable explanation of the insulation of so large a mass of rock\r\nwill be by the first mentioned supposition. This fact, therefore,\r\nnotwithstanding the great attention M. De Luc has bestowed on it,\r\nstill requires further examination, before it can be decided whether\r\nit inclines to the Huttonian Theory, as on the first supposition, or\r\nis, as on the latter hypothesis, equally balanced between it and the\r\n_Wernerian_.\r\n\r\n232. Whatever be the case with this fact, the general one of pieces of\r\nrock being found insulated in veins, is certainly favourable to the\r\nnotion of an injected and ponderous fluid having originally sustained\r\nthem. Where, as happens in some instances, the stones contained in\r\nthe veins have no affinity to any of the rocks above, they cannot\r\nbe supposed to have come any how but from below, and to have been\r\ncarried up by the matter of the vein. The instance from the slip at the\r\nHuddersfield Canal has been already mentioned.\r\n\r\n233. The preceding observations have been principally directed against\r\nthat theory of veins which supposes them to have been filled by\r\ndeposition from water. There is another theory maintained by some\r\nof the Neptunists, that the metals in veins were introduced there by\r\ninfiltration.[119] This opinion is sufficiently refuted by the fact,\r\nthat rarely any metallic ore is found out of the vein, or in the rock\r\non either side of it, and least of all where the vein is richest.\r\nThis is inconsistent with the notion of the ore being carried into\r\nthe vein by water percolating through the adjacent rocks, unless some\r\nsatisfactory reason is assigned, which determined the water to leave\r\nthe ore in the vein and no where else. Besides, this hypothesis does\r\nnot account for the formation of the spars and veinstones which fill\r\nthe vein, and which appear clearly to have been brought there at the\r\nsame time with the ore, and no doubt by the same cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Geol. Essays, p. 401.]\r\n\r\n234. The veins, properly so called, are indefinitely extended; but\r\nthere are also thin plates of spar, and of crystals of different kinds,\r\noften found included in rocks, and shut in on all sides, to which the\r\nname of veins is commonly applied. These last ought certainly to be\r\ndistinguished from the former, and may not improperly be called _Plate\r\nVeins_ or _Lenticular Veins_, the plate or cake of spar of which they\r\nconsist having very often the form of a lens, though, as may be\r\nsupposed, considerably irregular. Either of these terms being derived\r\nentirely from external characters, has the advantage of involving\r\nnothing theoretical.\r\n\r\nThe lenticular veins are certainly not formed like the usual mineral\r\nveins, by injection, since they are shut in, on all sides, by the solid\r\nrock. When they are found, therefore, in stratified rocks, such as\r\nhave not themselves been melted, we must conceive them to be composed\r\nof materials more fusible than the surrounding rock, so that they\r\nhave been brought into fusion by a degree of heat which the rest of\r\nthe rock was able to resist, and, on cooling, have assumed a sparry\r\nstructure. When they are found in rocks, of which the whole has been\r\nfluid, they must be considered as component parts of that mass, which,\r\nby an elective attraction, have united with one another, and separated\r\nthemselves from the substances to which they had less affinity.\r\n\r\nThe veins of this kind seem to be connected with those called in\r\nDerbyshire _Pipe Veins_, in which the ores of metals are sometimes\r\nfound. The pipe veins, indeed, are not in all cases completely\r\ninsulated, but sometimes communicate with the veins properly called\r\nmineral. I am too little acquainted, however, with their natural\r\nhistory, to Be able to say with certainty to which of the two species\r\nthey ought to be referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE XIV. § 75.\r\n\r\n                            _On Whinstone._\r\n\r\n\r\n235. To the facts and reasonings given above, I shall, in this note,\r\nadd a few remarks, tending to show, that whinstone is not of volcanic,\r\nnor of aqueous, but certainly of igneous origin.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted, (§ 62,) that carbonate of lime and zeolite are often\r\ncontained in whinstone, but never in lava, and that this circumstance\r\nmay sometimes serve to distinguish these stones from one another. With\r\nrespect to carbonate of lime, in particular, it seems evident, that\r\nthis substance cannot enter into the original composition of any lava,\r\nbecause the same heat which melted the lava, would, where there was no\r\ngreater pressure than the weight of the atmosphere, expel the carbonic\r\nacid and produce quicklime. Notwithstanding this, rocks containing\r\ncarbonate of lime, have often been considered as lavas, into the pores\r\nand cavities of which, calcareous matter having been carried by the\r\ninfiltration of water, had crystallized into spar. Thus SPALLANZANI,\r\nin his account of the Euganean Hills, in Lombardy, describes some of\r\nthe rocks as abounding at their surface, and even in their interior,\r\nwith air-bubbles of various sizes, from such as are hardly perceptible,\r\nto some that are half an inch in diameter; and which, he says, are all\r\nof an oval figure, with their longest diameters in the same direction.\r\nThis he considers as a proof that the rock is a genuine lava; for the\r\nair-bubbles prove the stone to have had its fluidity from fire; and\r\nby their elongation in the same direction they prove, that the mass\r\nwhen fluid was also in motion. Spallanzani adds, that _many of these\r\ncavities are filled with crystals of the carbonate of lime, an effect\r\nof the infiltration of water_.[120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Voyages dans les deux Siciles, tom. iii. p. 157. Edit.\r\nde Faujas de St Fond.]\r\n\r\n236. Though the argument here advanced for the igneous origin of the\r\nrock may be admitted as conclusive, the introduction of calcareous\r\nspar into it by infiltration must still be questioned. Lava, except\r\nin a state of decay or decomposition, is not readily penetrated by\r\nwater; and, if it were, the filling of cavities with spar, by means\r\nof the water percolating through them, would still be subject to many\r\ndifficulties, (§12.). Besides, whinstone rocks are frequently found so\r\nfull of calcareous spar, or of zeolite, that they would become porous\r\nto such a degree, if the cavities filled with these latter substances\r\nwere all empty, that they could hardly sustain their own weight, and\r\nmuch less that of the great masses of rock incumbent on them. In such\r\ncases, it is certain, that the crystallized substances were part of the\r\noriginal composition of the rock. The truth is, that the infiltration\r\nof the water is a mere gratuitous assumption, introduced for the\r\npurpose of explaining the existence of carbonated lime in a stone which\r\nhad endured the action of intense heat: and this assumption ought of\r\ncourse to be rejected, if the phenomenon can be explained by a theory,\r\nthat is in other respects conformable to nature. The spar, then, may be\r\nconsidered as a proof, that the rocks in question are to be numbered\r\nwith those unerupted lavas which have flowed deep in the bowels of the\r\nearth, and under a great compressing force. This is the more probable,\r\nthat the Euganean Hills, like some whinstone hills in our own country,\r\nhave, in certain places, a covering of slaty and calcareous strata\r\nincumbent on them, even at their summits,[121] so that the torrent of\r\nmelted stone, of which they are admitted to consist, cannot have flowed\r\nfrom the mouth of a volcano. I do not mean to say, that there are\r\namong these hills no vestiges of volcanic explosion. I am very far from\r\nhaving _data_ sufficient for drawing this conclusion; but I believe it\r\nmay be safely affirmed, that the bulk of them is no more composed of\r\nvolcanic lava, than the basaltes of Staffa, or of the Giant's Causeway.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Phil. Trans. 1775, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n237. But, besides the evidence deduced from calcareous spar and\r\nzeolite, against the rocks containing them being real lava, there are\r\nother marks, even less equivocal perhaps, that distinguish the lavas\r\nwhich we suppose to have flowed in the mineral regions, from those\r\nwhich have actually flowed on the surface. These are what we collect\r\nfrom the disposition, the organization, or, as we may say, the physical\r\ngeography of whinstone countries, unlike, in so many respects, to that\r\nof volcanic countries. The shape of whinstone hills; their large flat\r\nterraces, rising one above another; their perpendicular faces, and the\r\ncorrespondence of their heights even at considerable distances; have\r\nnothing similar to them in the irregular torrents of volcanic lavas.\r\nThe phenomena of the former are also on a scale of magnitude very far\r\nexceeding the latter, and clearly indicate, that though both have been\r\nproduced by fire, it has been by fire in very different circumstances,\r\nand regulated by very different laws. The structure of the two kinds\r\nof rock agrees, in many respects, and so does their chemical analysis;\r\nbut their disposition and arrangement are so dissimilar, that they\r\ncannot be supposed to be of the same formation.\r\n\r\n238. This argument, I believe, was first stated by Mr Strange, in\r\na letter to Sir JOHN PRINGLE, published in the 65th volume of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_.[122] That intelligent observer, after\r\nvisiting the countries in Europe most remarkable either for burning,\r\nor for what are accounted, extinguished volcanoes, and examining them\r\nwith a very discriminating eye, remained convinced, that there are two\r\ndistinct species of rock, which both owe their origin to fire; but\r\nto fire acting in circumstances and situations extremely different.\r\nThe first is the common volcanic lava; the other, to which he gives\r\nthe name of a basaltine rock, comprehends such rocks as the Giant's\r\nCauseway, the basaltes of the Vivarais, of the Euganean Hills, &c.\r\nand differs in nothing from that which is called here by the name\r\nof whinstone. Mr Strange conceived, that the one of these kinds of\r\nstone could, no more than the other, be accounted the work of aqueous\r\ndeposition, but was led to the distinction just mentioned, by observing\r\nthe organization and arrangement in the rocks of the latter kind, and\r\ncomparing them with the disorder and ruin that every where mark the\r\nfootsteps of volcanic fire He does not pretend to determine the nature\r\nof the fire to which the basaltine rocks owe their formation, nor the\r\ncircumstances in which it has acted: he is satisfied with the negative\r\nconclusion, that it is not volcanic; and his paper affords a specimen\r\nof what is perhaps rare in any of the sciences, and certainly most rare\r\nof all in geology, viz. a philosophic induction carried just as far as\r\nthe facts will bear it out, and not a single step beyond that point.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Account of Two Giants' Causeways in the Venetian State,\r\n&c. by John Strange, Esq. Phil. Trans. vol. lxv. (1775,) p. 5, &c.]\r\n\r\n239. Several other hints contained in this paper are highly deserving\r\nof notice; for we not only find in it the notion of a formation of\r\nbasaltic rocks, igneous though not volcanic, but also that of their\r\nsimultaneous crystallization,[123] together with the suggestion, that\r\ngranite and basalt are of the same origin,[124] These opinions had not,\r\nI believe, occurred at that time to any mineralogist except Dr Hutton,\r\nnor had they been communicated by him to any but a few of his most\r\nintimate friends; so that Mr Strange has without doubt all the merit\r\nof a first discoverer. Indeed, without the knowledge of the principle\r\nof compression, such as it is laid down by Dr Hutton, it was hardly\r\npossible for him to proceed further than he has done. He remarked\r\nthe unburnt limestone that lies on the tops of some of the Euganean\r\nbasaltes, and seems to have been aware of the great difficulty, which\r\nit was reserved for the Huttonian Theory to overcome. His letter\r\ncontains also some excellent general remarks on the rocks of the\r\nVivarais and Velay, which he had visited, before FAUJAS DE ST FOND had\r\npublished his curious and elaborate description of these countries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Phil. Trans, _ubi supra_, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: _Ibid._ p. 36 and 37.]\r\n\r\n240. The cause of the peculiar structure which has just been observed\r\nto distinguish whinstone from volcanic countries, is easily assigned\r\nin the Huttonian Theory. According to that theory, the whinstone rocks\r\nwere formed, in the bowels of the earth, of melted matter poured into\r\nthe rents and openings of the strata. They were cast, therefore,\r\nin those openings, as in a mould; and received the impression and\r\ncharacter of the rocks by which they were surrounded. Hence the tabular\r\nmasses of whinstone, which when soft have been interposed between\r\nstrata, and compressed by their weight, so as almost to have themselves\r\nacquired the appearance of stratification. Hence the perpendicular\r\nfaces of the same rocks, produced by their being abutted when yet\r\nsoft, against the abrupt sides of the strata. The rocks which formed\r\nthose moulds have, in many cases, entirely disappeared; in others, a\r\npart still remains, surrounding, or even covering, the basaltes, as in\r\nthe Euganean Hills, in those of the Val di Noto in Sicily, the rocks\r\nnear Lisbon,[125] and in different parts of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Recherches sur les Volcans Eteints du Vivarais; Lettre\r\ndu Dolomieu, p. 443.]\r\n\r\nAbove all, the veins of whinstone which intersect the strata, are the\r\ncompletest proofs of the theory here given of these rocks, and the most\r\ninconsistent, in all respects, with the hypothesis of their volcanic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n241. If these _criteria_ are applied to what are called extinguished\r\nvolcanoes, I have no doubt that many which have been reckoned of that\r\nnumber, will be found to derive their origin more directly from the\r\nfire of the mineral regions. The basaltic rocks of the Vivarais, I am\r\nwell persuaded, belong to this class; and I conclude that they do so,\r\nnot only from the account of them given by Mr Strange, but from the\r\ndescription of Faujas himself, who, though under the influence of the\r\nopposite theory, seems very fair and accurate in his description of\r\nphenomena. The most unequivocal mark of real whinstone rock, and of\r\na formation in the strictest sense mineral, is where veins of that\r\nkind of rock intersect the strata. Now, in a letter to Buffon, on the\r\nstreams of lava found in the interior of certain calcareous rocks in\r\nthe lower Vivarais, Faujas describes what can be accounted nothing\r\nelse but a vein or dike of whinstone, accompanied with several of\r\nits most remarkable and characteristic appearances: \"Figurez-vous un\r\ncourant de lave, de la nature du basalte noir, dur et compacte, qui a\r\npercé à travers les masses calcaires, et s'est fait jour dans quelques\r\nparties, paroissant et disparoissant alternativement: Cette coulée\r\nde matière volcanique s'enfonce sous une partie de la ville, bâtie\r\nsur le rocher; elle reparoit dans la cave d'un maréchal, se cache et\r\nse montre encore de temps en temps en descendant dans le vallon, &c.\r\nCe qu'il y a d'admirable, c'est que la lave forme deux branches bien\r\nextraordinaires, dont l'une s'éleve sur la crête du rocher, tandis que\r\nl'autre coupe horizontalement de grands bancs calcaires escarpés, qui\r\nsont à découvert, et bordent le chemin.\r\n\r\n\"Quels efforts n'-a-t-il pas fallu pour forcer cette lave se prendre\r\nune telle direction, et se percer cette suite de rochers calcaires?\r\nSi cette longue coulée de lave avoit eu 200 ou 300 toises de largeur,\r\nje ne serois pas surpris qu'un torrent de matière en fusion de ce\r\nvolume eut pu produire, des effets extraordinaires et violens; _mais\r\nfigurez-vous, Monsieur, que dans les endroits les plus larges, elle n'a\r\ntout-au-plus qu'environ 12 ou 15 pieds; elle n'en a que 3 ou 4 dans\r\ncertaines parties_\".[126]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Volcains Eteints du Vivarais, p. 328, &c.]\r\n\r\nThis narrow stream is to be traced across the strata for more than a\r\nleague and a half; and the whole appeared to Faujas so marvellous,\r\nthat he says he almost doubted the testimony of his senses. He would\r\nhave done much better, however, to have doubted the conclusions of his\r\ntheory; for it was by them that the phenomena before him were rendered\r\nso mysterious and incredible. While he continued to regard what is\r\ndescribed above as a stream of melted lava, which had descended from\r\nthe top of one mountain, and climbed up the sides of the opposite, like\r\nwater in a conduit pipe, piercing occasionally through vast bodies of\r\nsolid rock, it is no wonder that he considered as marvellous what is\r\nindeed physically impossible. Had his belief in the volcanic theory\r\npermitted him to see in all this, not a superficial current, but one of\r\nindefinite depth, he would have beheld the object divested, not of what\r\nwas curious and interesting, but of what was incredible or absurd, and\r\nreduced to the same class of things with mineral veins. That it belongs\r\nreally to this class, and is no more than a vein or dike of whinstone,\r\nintersecting the strata to an unknown depth, and most probably, like\r\nother veins, communicating with the mineral regions, cannot be doubted\r\nby any one who has studied the subject of basaltine rocks, through\r\nany other medium than the volcanic theory. The ramifications which\r\nrun from it into the calcareous rock, contrived, Faujas says, just as\r\nif on purpose to perplex mineralogists, is one of the well known and\r\ncharacteristic appearances of basaltic veins.\r\n\r\n242. It can hardly be doubted, that the lava described by the same\r\nauthor as heaving up a mass of granite,[127] and including pieces of\r\nit, is a rock of real whinstone. The same may be said of many others;\r\nand, though I pretend not to affirm that there is nothing volcanic in\r\nthe Vivarais, I must say, that nothing decidedly volcanic appears in\r\nthe description of that country, but many things that are certainly of\r\na very different origin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Volcains Eteints du Vivarais, fol. p. 365, &c.]\r\n\r\nIn the present state of geological science, a skilful mineralogist\r\ncould hardly employ himself better, than in traversing those ambiguous\r\ncountries, where so much has been ascribed to the ancient operation\r\nof volcanic fire, and marking out what belongs either clearly to the\r\nerupted or unerupted lavas, and what parts are of doubtful formation,\r\ncontaining no mark by which they may be referred to the one of these\r\nany more than the other. Such a work would contribute very materially\r\nto illustrate the natural history of the earth.\r\n\r\n243. One of the most ingenious attempts to support the volcanic theory,\r\nis the system of _submarine volcanoes_, imagined by the celebrated\r\nmineralogist DOLOMIEU. The phenomenon that led to this hypothesis,\r\nwas what he had observed in the hills near Lisbon, and still more\r\nremarkably in those of the Val di Noto in Sicily, where the basaltine\r\nrocks had regular strata incumbent on them, and in some cases\r\ninterposed or alternated with them.[128] It seemed from this evident,\r\nthat the strata were of later formation than the stone on which they\r\nrested; and as they must, on every supposition, be held to be deposited\r\nby water, it was concluded, that the lava which they covered had been\r\nthrown out by volcanoes at the bottom of the sea; that the strata had\r\nafterwards been deposited on this lava; and that, in some cases, there\r\nhad been frequent alternations of these eruptions and depositions.[129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Mémoire de Deodate de Dolomieu, sur les Volcains\r\nEteints du Val di Noto, en Sicile. Journal de Phys. tom. xxv. (1784.\r\nSeptembre.) p. 191.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Near Vizini, in the Val di Noto, Dolomieu tells us,\r\nthat he counted eleven beds, alternately calcareous and volcanic, in\r\nthe perpendicular face of a hill, which at a distance appeared like a\r\npiece of cloth, striped black and white; _ubi supra_. He has since made\r\nsimilar observations in the Vicentine and in Tyrol. Journal de Phys.\r\ntom. xxxvii. (1790), partie 2, p. 200.]\r\n\r\n244. Though this hypothesis does certainly deliver the system of\r\nthe Volcanists from one great difficulty, it is itself liable to\r\ninsurmountable objections. I shall just mention some of the principal.\r\n\r\n1. The regular and equidistant strata that we often see covering the\r\ntops of whinstone or basaltic rocks, could not have been deposited in\r\nthe oblique and very much inclined position which they now occupy.\r\n\r\nThis is remarkable in the strata which cover the basaltic rock of\r\nSalisbury _Craig_, near Edinburgh, at its northern extremity. The\r\nstrata are very regular, and must have been deposited in a plane nearly\r\nhorizontal; yet the surface of the basaltes on which they now rest is\r\nvery much inclined, dipping rapidly to the north-east. The necessity of\r\na horizontal deposition in strata, which, though not now horizontal,\r\nhave their planes nearly parallel to one another, has been proved at §\r\n38.\r\n\r\n2. If there is any truth in the principles established above, even the\r\nstrata themselves have not been consolidated without the action of\r\nfire. By Dolomieu's system, therefore, the consolidation of the strata\r\nwhich cover the basaltes is not accounted for.\r\n\r\n3. There are no means furnished by the hypothesis of submarine\r\nvolcanoes for bringing the basalt, and the strata which cover it,\r\nabove the level of the sea. If it is said that the waters of the sea\r\nhave been drained off, the objections are all incurred that have been\r\nstated at § 37.[130] If it is said, that the rocks themselves have been\r\nelevated by a force, impelling them upwards, we say, that the existence\r\nof such a force, when admitted, furnishes another means of explaining\r\nthe whole phenomenon, namely, that of the injection of melted matter\r\namong the strata, the same that is used in the Huttonian Theory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Dolomieu adopts this supposition; he thinks, that the\r\nsurface of the sea must have been formerly 500 or 600 toises above its\r\npresent level. _Ibid._ p. 196.]\r\n\r\n4. The phenomena of basaltic veins are not in the least explained by\r\nthe hypothesis of submarine volcanoes. That hypothesis, then, even\r\nif the foregoing objections were removed, does not serve to explain\r\nall the facts respecting the rocks of this genus, and wants, of\r\nconsequence, one of the most important characters of a true theory.\r\nIt must be allowed, however, that it makes a considerable approach to\r\nsuch a theory, and that the submarine volcanoes of Dolomieu, have an\r\naffinity to the unerupted lavas of Dr Hutton.\r\n\r\n245. Though in these remarks I have endeavoured to expose the errors\r\nof the volcanic system, I cannot but consider that system as coming\r\ninfinitely nearer to the truth than the Neptunian. It has the merit\r\nof distinguishing an order of rocks, which bears no marks of aqueous\r\nformation, and in which the crystallized, sparry, or lava-like\r\nstructure, bespeaks their primeval fluidity, and refers their origin\r\nto fire. The Neptunian system, on the other hand, strives to confound\r\nthe most marked distinction in the mineral kingdom, and to explain\r\nthe formation, both of the stratified and unstratified rocks, by\r\nthe operation of the same element. Though chargeable with this\r\ninconsistency, it has become the prevailing system of geology; and the\r\narguments which support it are therefore entitled to attention.\r\n\r\n246. It will no doubt be thought singular, that the same mineralogist,\r\nwhom we have just seen exerting his ingenuity in defence of the\r\nvolcanic system, should now appear equally strenuous in defence of the\r\nNeptunian. Though Dolomieu contends for the volcanic origin of some\r\nbasaltic rocks, he does not admit that all basaltes is volcanic, nor\r\neven all of igneous formation. Thus he states, that he had examined at\r\nRome some of the most ancient monuments of art, executed in basaltes,\r\nbrought from Upper Egypt, and that he could discover no mark of the\r\naction of fire in any of them.[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Journal de Physique, tome xxxvii. (1790,) partie 2, p.\r\n193.]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he found that some of them consisted of green\r\nbasaltes, which changes its colour to a bronze, when exposed even to a\r\nmoderate heat, and which therefore, he argues, can never have endured\r\nany strong action of fire.\r\n\r\nThe answer to this argument is very plain, if we admit the effects\r\nascribed by Dr Hutton to the compression which necessarily takes place\r\nin the mineral regions. If indeed the heat in those regions resembled\r\nexactly that of our fires at the surface, it would not be easy to deny\r\nthe above conclusion, which therefore certainly holds good against\r\nthe volcanic origin of the Egyptian basaltes. But there is no reason\r\nwhy, under strong compression, the colouring matter of these stones\r\nmight not be fixed, and indestructible by heat, though it can be easily\r\nvolatilized or consumed when such compression is removed. This argument\r\nthen is against the volcanic; but not against what has been called the\r\n_Plutonic_ formation of basaltes.\r\n\r\n247. As to the other marks of fire which Dolomieu sought for and did\r\nnot find in the above mentioned stones, we are not exactly informed\r\nin what they consisted. If the crystallized or spathose texture that\r\nbelongs to this description of stones was wanting, the specimens were\r\nnot to be considered as of the real basaltic or whinstone genus,\r\nwhatever their name or history may seem to indicate. If they did\r\npossess that texture, they had the only mark of an igneous origin that\r\ncould be expected, supposing that origin to have been in the bowels of\r\nthe earth. No part, therefore, of the observations of this ingenious\r\nmineralogist, can be considered as inconsistent with the theory of\r\nbasaltic rocks which has been laid down above.\r\n\r\n248. Bergman had before reasoned on this subject precisely in the same\r\nmanner, but from better data, as the stones from which he derived\r\nhis argument were in their native place: \"Trap,\" says that ingenious\r\nauthor, (that is whinstone,) \"is found in the stratified mountains\r\nof West Gothland, in a way that deserves to be described. The lower\r\nstratum, which is several Swedish miles in circuit, (10-1/2 of these\r\nmiles make a degree,) is an arenaceous stone, horizontal, resting on\r\ngranite, and having its particles agglutinated by clay. The stratum\r\nabove this is calcareous, full of the petrifactions of marine animals,\r\nand above this is the trap. These three kinds of rock compose the\r\ngreater part of the mountains just mentioned, though there are some\r\nother beds, particularly very thin beds of marl and of clay, which\r\nseparate the middle stratum, both from that which is under it and\r\nover it, and are frequently so penetrated with bitumen that they\r\nburn in the fire. This schistus is black; when burnt it becomes red,\r\nand afterwards, when washed with water, affords alum. How can it be\r\nsupposed,\" he adds, \"that the trap has ever been violently heated,\r\nwhile the shistus on which it is incumbent retains its blackness, which\r\nhowever it loses by the action even of a very weak fire?\"[132]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Bergman de Productis Volcaniis, Opuscula, tom. iii. p.\r\n214, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe answer to this argument is already given. The reasoning, as\r\nin the former instance, is conclusive only against the action of\r\nvolcanic fire, or fire at the surface; but not against the action of\r\nheat deep in the bowels of the earth, and under the pressure of the\r\nsuperincumbent ocean. In such a situation, the bituminous schistus\r\nmight be in contact with the melted basalt, and yet there might be no\r\nevaporation of the volatile, nor combustion of the inflammable parts.\r\nIt does not, however, always happen, that the bituminous substances, or\r\nsubstances alterable by fire, which are found in contact with basaltes,\r\nare without any mark of having endured the operation of fire. Instances\r\nin which such operation is apparent are given above, § 30; and more\r\nwill be added in the conclusion of this note.\r\n\r\n249. The same mineralogist founds another argument for the aqueous\r\nformation of whin or trap on the existence of that stone in the form\r\nof veins, included in primeval rocks: \"Invenitur hoc saxum (trap) in\r\nSuecia pluribus locis, sæpeque in montibus primævis, angustas implens\r\nvenas, adeo subtilis structuræ, ut particulæ sint impalpabiles, et, dum\r\nniger est, genuinum efficit lapidem Lydium. In hisce montibus, nulla\r\nadsunt ignis subterranei vestigia.\"[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Opuscula, _ubi supra_.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena here described, namely, a vein of compact whinstone\r\ntraversing a primary rock, is, without doubt, as incapable of being\r\nexplained by the operation of a volcano, as it is by that of aqueous\r\ndeposition. It is, however, a most complete proof of the original\r\nsoftness of the substance of which the veins consist, and affords one\r\nof the strongest possible arguments for such an operation of fire as is\r\nsupposed in the present theory. The main arguments, therefore, which\r\nhave been proposed as subversive of the igneous origin of basaltes, are\r\nonly subversive of their formation by one modification of fire, viz.\r\nof fire acting near the surface; and thus the weapons which directly\r\npierce the armour of the Volcanist, and inflict a mortal wound, are\r\neasily turned aside by the superior temper of the _Plutonic_ mail.\r\n\r\n250. An argument founded on facts very similar to some of the\r\npreceding, and leading to the same conclusion, is employed by the\r\nmineralogist to whom the Neptunian system owes its chief support.\r\nWerner, in his observations on volcanic rocks and on basaltes, has\r\nrested his proof of the aqueous formation of the latter, on their\r\ninterposition between beds of stone in mountains regularly stratified,\r\nand obviously formed by water. He describes an instance of this in the\r\nbasaltic hill of _Scheibenberg_; and the facts, though most of them are\r\nnot uncommon, are highly deserving of attention. Near the top of this\r\nhill, and above the basaltic rock which composes the body of it, he\r\ntells us, that there was a sand-pit; a circumstance which he appears\r\nto consider as not a little singular. It was, however, at the bottom of\r\nthe hill, that he met with the appearances which chiefly attracted his\r\nnotice: \"First,\" says he; \"or lowest, was a thick bank of quartzy sand,\r\nabove that a bed of clay, then a bed of the argillaceous stone called\r\nwacke; and upon this last rested the basaltes.\" \"When I saw,\" adds he,\r\n\"the three first beds running almost horizontally under the basaltes,\r\nand forming its base; the sand becoming finer above, then argillaceous,\r\nand at last changing into real clay, as the argil was converted into\r\nwacke in the superior part; and, lastly, the wacke into basaltes; in a\r\nword, when I found a perfect transition from pure sand to argillaceous\r\nsand, from the latter to a sandy clay, and from this sandy clay,\r\nthrough many gradations, to a fat clay, to wacke, and at last basaltes,\r\nI was irresistibly led to conclude, that the basaltes, the wacke, the\r\nclay, and the sand, are all of one and the same formation; and that\r\nthey are all the effect of a chemical precipitation during one and the\r\nsame submersion of this country.\"[134]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: \"Combien je fus surpris de voir en arrivant au fond,\r\nun epais _banc de sable quartzeux_, puis au-dessus une _couche\r\nd'argile_, enfin une couche de la pierre argileuse nommée _Wacke_, et\r\nsur celle-ci reposer le _basalte_. Quand je vis les trois premiéres\r\ncouches s'enfoncer _presqu' horizontalement sous le basalte_, et former\r\nainsi sa _base_; le sable devenir plus fin au-dessus, puis argileux,\r\net se changer enfin en vraie argile, comme l'argile se convertissoit\r\nen wacke dans sa partie supérieure; et finalement la wacke en basalte;\r\nen un mot, de trouver ici une _transition parfaite_ du _sable pur_ au\r\n_sable argileux_, de celui-ci à _l'argile sablonneuse_, et de _l'argile\r\nsablonneuse_, par plusieurs gradations, à l'argile _grasse_, à la\r\n_wacke_ et enfin au _basalte_.\r\n\r\n\"A cette vue, je fus sur le champ et irrésistiblement entrainé à\r\npenser, (comme l'auroit été sans doute tout connoisseur impartial\r\nfrappé des conséquences de ce phénomène;) je fus, dis je,\r\nirrésistiblement entrainé aux id es suivantes: Ce _basalte_, cette\r\n_wacke_, cette _argile_, et ce _sable, sont d'une seule et même\r\nformation_; ils sont tous l'effet d'une _precipitation par voie humide_\r\ndans une seule et même submersion de cette contrée; les eaux qui la\r\ncouvroient alors transportoient d'abord le _sable_, puis deposoient\r\nl'_argile_, et changoient peu-à-peu leur précipitation en _wacke_, et\r\nenfin en vraie _basalte_.--Journal de Physique, tom. xxxviii. (1791,)\r\nPartie i. p. 415.]\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the sand on the top of this basaltic hill, it is most\r\nprobably the remains of certain sandstone strata that originally\r\ncovered the basaltic part, but are now worn away. We are therefore to\r\nconsider this as an instance of a basaltic rock, interposed between\r\nstrata that are undoubtedly of marine origin. In this, however, there\r\nis nothing inconsistent with Dr Hutton's theory of basaltes; on the\r\ncontrary, it is one of the principal facts on which that theory is\r\nfounded. It has indeed been argued by some mineralogists, that bodies\r\nthus contiguous must owe their origin to the same element, and that\r\na mineral substance cannot be of more recent formation than that\r\nwhich lies above it. But the maxim, that a fossil must have the same\r\norigin with those that surround it, does not hold, unless they have a\r\ncertain similarity of structure. It is, for instance, the want of this\r\nsimilarity, that authorizes us to assign different periods of formation\r\nto mineral veins, and to the rocks in which they are included.\r\n\r\nIn a succession of strata, no one can doubt, that the lowest were the\r\nfirst formed, and the others in the order in which they lie; but, when\r\nbetween two strata of sandstone or of limestone we find an intermediate\r\nrock, so different as to resemble lava, and to have nothing schistose\r\nor stratified in its composition, the same instrument cannot be\r\nsupposed to have been employed in the formation of both; nor is there\r\nany reason why we may not suppose, that the intermediate body was\r\ninterposed between the other two, by some action subsequent to their\r\nformation. It was thus that Dolomieu concluded, when he saw a lava-like\r\nstone interposed between calcareous strata in the Val di Noto, that,\r\nthough contiguous, these two rocks could not possibly be of the same\r\nformation; and thus far it is certain, that every unprejudiced observer\r\nmust agree with him.\r\n\r\n251. But the circumstance on which Werner seems to lay the greatest\r\nstress, is the gradual transition from the sand to the basalt, through\r\nthe intermediate steps of clay and wacke; this gradual transition he\r\nconsiders as a direct proof, that they are all of the same formation.\r\n\r\nA gradual transition of one body into another, can only be said to\r\ntake place, when it is impossible to define their common boundary,\r\nor to determine the line where the one begins and the other ends.\r\nNow, if this be the proper notion of gradual transition, I must say,\r\nthat after much careful examination, I have never seen an instance,\r\nin which such a transition takes place between whinstone and the\r\ncontiguous strata. The _line_ of separation, though in some places\r\nless evident than in others, has, on the whole, been marked out with\r\ngreat precision; and, though the stones have been firmly united, or,\r\nas one may say, welded one upon another, yet, when a fresh fracture\r\nwas obtained, the stratified and unstratified parts have rarely failed\r\nto be distinguished. The fresh fracture is indeed often necessary, for\r\nmany species of whinstone get by decomposition a granulated texture at\r\nthe surface, so as hardly to be distinguished from real sandstone.\r\n\r\nSome of the kinds of primary schistus also, particularly the\r\nargillaceous, when much indurated, have in their structure a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to whinstone; they are slightly granular, or\r\nlaminated, and have a tendency to a sparry texture. Where it happens\r\nthat this sort of schistus and whinstone are contiguous, it is natural\r\nto expect, that their common boundary will be traced with difficulty,\r\nand in many parts will be quite uncertain. Still, however, if a careful\r\nexamination is made; if the effects of accidental causes are removed;\r\nand, above all, if the more ambiguous instances are compared with the\r\nmore decisive, and interpreted by them, though single specimens may be\r\ndoubtful, we will hardly ever find that any uncertainty remains with\r\nrespect to entire rocks.\r\n\r\n252. This general fact, which I state on much better authority than\r\nthat of my own observations, viz. on those of Dr Hutton, is not given\r\nas absolutely without exception. The theory of whinstone which has\r\nbeen laid down here, leads us indeed to look for some such exceptions.\r\nIt is certain, that the basis of whinstone, or the material out of\r\nwhich it is prepared by the action of subterraneous heat, is clay in\r\nsome state or other, and probably in that of argillaceous schistus.\r\nIt follows, of consequence, that argillaceous schistus may by heat be\r\nconverted into whinstone, or the material out of which is prepared by\r\nthe action of subterraneous heat, is clay in some state or other, and\r\nprobably in that of argillaceous schistus. It follows, of consequence,\r\nthat argillaceous schistus may by heat be converted into whinstone.\r\nWhen, therefore, melted whinstone has been poured over a rock of such\r\nshistus, it may, by its heat, have converted a part of that rock into\r\na stone similar to itself; and thus may now seem to be united, by\r\nan insensible gradation, with the stratum on which it is incumbent;\r\nand phenomena of this kind may be expected to have really happened,\r\nthough but rarely, as a particular combination of circumstances seems\r\nnecessary to produce them. Hence it is evident, that stones may\r\ngraduate into one another, without being of the same formation; and\r\nthat it is fallacious to conclude, from the insensible transition\r\nof one kind of rock into another, without any other circumstance of\r\naffinity, that they have both the same origin.\r\n\r\nI am disposed, therefore, to make some limitation to what is said\r\nin § 72, where I have expressed an absolute incredulity as to such\r\ntransitions as are here referred to. The great skill and experience\r\nof the mineralogist who has described the strata at Scheibenberg, do\r\nnot allow us to doubt of his exactness, though some of the appearances\r\nare such as decomposition and wearing might well enough be supposed to\r\nproduce. The fairest way is to take Mr Werner's observations just as\r\nthey are given us, and to try whether they cannot be explained without\r\nthe assistance of his theory. In effect, the wacken which he describes,\r\nrests, it would seem, on an unconsolidated bed of clay; and it may be\r\nsupposed, that a part of this bed has been converted into wacken by\r\nthe heat of the incumbent mass, and has thus produced the apparent\r\ngradation from the one substance to the other. As the appearances of\r\nthe rocks of Scheibenberg seem to be considered by Werner as furnishing\r\na very strong, and even an unexpected confirmation of his system, I\r\ncannot help thinking, that an explanation of them, on the principles\r\nof Dr Hutton, without any straining or forcing of those principles,\r\ncontributes not a little toward extending the empire of the latter over\r\nall the phenomena of geology.\r\n\r\n253. Another fact, which has been much infilled on of late, in proof\r\nof the aqueous formation of basaltic rocks, is that shells are found\r\nin them. Of the reality of this fact, however, or at least of the\r\ninstances hitherto produced, great doubts I think may be reasonably\r\nentertained. The specimens of the supposed basaltes, with shells\r\nincluded in them, that are chiefly relied on, are found at Portrush in\r\nIreland, a rocky promontory to the westward of the Giant's Causeway,\r\nand separated from it by a considerable body of calcareous strata.\r\nSome of these specimens were brought to Edinburgh about a year ago,\r\nand were supposed, I believe, to contain an irrefragable proof of the\r\nNeptunian origin of the basaltic promontory where they were found. I\r\nwent to see these specimens in company with Lord Webb Seymour and Sir\r\nJames Hall; and, on examining them carefully, we were all of opinion,\r\nthat the stones which contained the shells, or the impressions of the\r\nshells, were no part of the real basaltes. They were all very compact,\r\nand had all more or less of a siliceous appearance, such as that of\r\nchert; they had nothing of a sparry or crystallized structure; their\r\nfracture was conchoidal, and but slightly uneven. In two of them,\r\none of which bore the impression of a _cornu ammonis_, the schistose\r\ntexture might be distinctly perceived. A specimen which accompanied\r\nthem, but in which there was no shell, served very exactly to explain\r\nthe relation between these stones and the true basaltes. Part of this\r\nspecimen was a true basalt, and the rest a sort of hornstone, exactly\r\nthe same with that in which the shells were, and not unlike the jasper\r\nthat is under the whinstone of Salisbury Crag, and in contact with\r\nit; so that on the whole it was evident, that the rock containing the\r\nshells is the schistus or stratified stone, which serves as the base of\r\nthe basaltes, and which has acquired a high degree of induration, by\r\nthe vicinity of the great ignited mass of whinstone.\r\n\r\nThis solution of the difficulty has since been confirmed by\r\nobservations made on the spot by Dr Hope, who discovered two or three\r\nalternations of the basaltic rock, with the beds of the schistus in\r\nwhich the shells are contained.\r\n\r\n254. This also explains some observations of Spallanzani, made in\r\nthe island of Cerigo, on the coast of Greece, the Cythæra of the\r\nancients.[135] The base of that island is limestone; but it abounds\r\nalso in unstratified rocks, which the Italian naturalist supposes to\r\nbe of volcanic origin; but which, if I mistake not, we would regard\r\nas whinstone, or perhaps porphyry; and they are said to contain\r\noyster-shells and pectinites of a large size, perfectly mineralized.\r\nThese petrifactions, however, Spallanzani says, are not contained\r\nin the lava that has actually flowed, but in stones which have only\r\nendured a slighter action of fire. Without the commentary afforded by\r\nthe Portrush specimens, it would be difficult to make out any thing\r\nvery precise from this description. By help of the information derived\r\nfrom those specimens, we may conclude, that the condition of the\r\nshells in them, and in the rocks of Cerigo, is perfectly alike; and\r\nthat, in both cases, the shells are involved in parts of the rock which\r\nare truly stratified, but which have been, in some degree, assimilated\r\nto the basaltes by the heat which they have endured. Spallanzani would\r\nprobably have used exactly the same terms which he employs in speaking\r\nof Cerigo, if he had been required to describe the petrified shells at\r\nPortrush.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Journal de physique, tom. xlviii. (1798,) p. 278.]\r\n\r\n255. In the instances just mentioned, the petrified marine objects are\r\nnot found in the real whinstone; but if they were found in it, when it\r\nborders on stratified rocks containing such objects, the thing would\r\nnot be at all surprising, nor furnish any argument against the igneous\r\nconsolidation of the stone. If a torrent of melted matter was poured\r\nin among the strata, by a force which at the same time broke up and\r\ndisordered those strata, nothing could be more natural, than that this\r\nmatter should contain fragments of them, and of the objects peculiar to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, mentioned by Mr Strange, this seems actually to have\r\ntaken place. In the Veronese, a country remarkable for a mixture of\r\nlimestone strata, containing marine objects, with volcanic or basaltine\r\nhills, he assures us, that he had seen a mass of stone, which had\r\nevidently concreted from fusion, in which the marine fossil bodies,\r\noriginally, as he supposes, contained in the strata, were perfectly\r\ndistinguishable, though variously disfigured.[136] It may be, that\r\nin this, as in the foregoing examples, it was not real basaltes, or\r\nreal lava, which contained the shells, but the conterminal rock; but,\r\nsupposing it to be as Mr Strange represents it, there appears to be\r\nno inconsistency between the phenomenon, and the igneous origin of\r\nthe rock in which the shells were included. Here, however, it should\r\nbe remarked, that the presence of great pressure, to prevent the\r\nconversion of the shells into quicklime, seems absolutely necessary;\r\nand that the phenomenon of these basaltic petrifactions, requires the\r\napplication of heat to have been deep under the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Phil. Trans. 1775, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n256. The phenomena we have been considering, have been selected as the\r\nmost unfavourable to the igneous origin of basaltic rocks; and we have\r\nseen, that when duly examined, they are not at all inconsistent with\r\nit. We are now to take a view of some appearances, that seem quite\r\nirreconcilable with the aqueous formation of these rocks.\r\n\r\nWhere whinstone rocks are found in masses, bounded by the strata,\r\nand insulated among them, they subject the Neptunian system to great\r\ndifficulties. For, supposing it true that this stone may be produced by\r\nthe precipitation and crystallization of mineral substances dissolved\r\nin water, yet it seems unaccountable, that this effect has been so\r\nlocal and limited in extent, as often to be confined to an irregular\r\nfigure of a few acres, while, all round, the substances deposited have\r\nhad no tendency to crystallization, and have been formed into the\r\ncommon secondary strata. The rock of Salisbury _Craig_, for instance,\r\nis a mass of whinstone, having a perpendicular face eighty or ninety\r\nfeet high toward the west, and extending from north to south with\r\na circular sweep about 900 yards. The whole of this rock rests on\r\nregular beds of secondary sandstone, not horizontal, but considerably\r\ndepressed toward the north-east: the rock is loftiest in the middle,\r\nand decreases in thickness toward each end, terminating at its northern\r\nextremity in a kind of wedge. It is covered at top, toward that\r\nextremity, with regular beds of sandstone, perfectly similar to those\r\non which it is incumbent; and it is not improbable, that this covering\r\nformerly extended over the whole.\r\n\r\nNow, what cause can have determined the column of water, which rested\r\non the base at present occupied by this rock, to deposit nothing but\r\nthe materials of whinstone, while the water on the south, west, and\r\nnorth, was depositing the materials of arenaceous and marly strata?\r\nWherefore, within this small space, was the precipitate every where\r\n_chemical_, to use the language of Werner, while close to it, on either\r\nside, it was entirely _mechanical?_ Why is there, in this case, no\r\ngradation? and why is a mere mathematical line the boundary between\r\nregions where such different laws have prevailed? Whence also, we may\r\nask, has the basaltic deposit been abruptly terminated toward the west,\r\nso as to produce the steep face which has just been mentioned? The\r\noperation of currents, or of any motion that can take place in a fluid,\r\nwill furnish no explanation whatever of these phenomena; yet they are\r\nphenomena far from being peculiar to a single hill; they are among the\r\nmost general and characteristic appearances in the natural history of\r\nwhinstone mountains; and a geological theory which does not account for\r\nthem, is hardly entitled to any consideration.\r\n\r\n257. The basaltic rock, just described, is also covered, at least\r\npartly, with strata perfectly similar to those that lie under it.\r\nNow, it appears altogether unaccountable, that after the water had\r\ndone depositing the materials of the whin on the spot in question,\r\nthe former order was so quickly resumed, and a deposition of sand,\r\nand of the other materials of the strata, took place just as before.\r\nAll this is quite unintelligible; and the principles of the Neptunian\r\nsystem seem here to stand as much in need of explanation, as any of the\r\nappearances which they are intended to account for.\r\n\r\n258. The unequal thickness, and great irregularity in the surface\r\nof the whinstone mass, here treated of, and of many rocks of the\r\nsame kind, is also a great objection to the notion of their aqueous\r\nformation. This seems to have been perceived by Werner, in the instance\r\nof the rocks formerly mentioned; and he endeavours to explain it, by\r\nsupposing, that much of these rocks has been destroyed by waste and\r\ndecomposition, so that an irregularity of their surface, and want of\r\ncorrespondence has been given to them, which they did not originally\r\npossess. In the instance of Salisbury _Craig_, however, we have a\r\nproof, that the great irregularity of surface, and the inequality of\r\nthickness, do not always arise from these causes. The thinnest part\r\nof that rock, toward its northern extremity, is still covered by the\r\nstrata in their natural place, and has been perfectly defended by them\r\nfrom every sort of wearing and decay. The cuneiform shape, therefore,\r\nwhich this rock takes at its extremities, and the great difference of\r\nits thickness at them and in the middle, is a part of its original\r\nconstitution, and can be attributed to nothing casual, or subsequent to\r\nits consolidation.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of many other basaltic rocks, where an inequality\r\nof thickness, most unlike to what belongs to aqueous deposits, is known\r\nto exist in beds of whinstone that are still deep under the surface.\r\nThus the toadstone of Derbyshire, even where it has a thick covering of\r\nstrata over it, has been found, by the sinking of perpendicular shafts,\r\nto vary from the thickness of eighteen yards to more than sixty, within\r\nthe horizontal distance of less than a furlong. Nothing of this kind\r\nis ever found to take place in those beds of rock which are certainly\r\nknown to originate from aqueous deposition, and no character can more\r\nstrongly mark an essential difference of formation.\r\n\r\n259. We have had frequent occasion to consider the characters of\r\nthose masses of whinstone which are so often found interposed between\r\nstratified rocks. These have been found in general very adverse to the\r\nNeptunian system; and two of them which yet remain to be mentioned,\r\nare even more so than any of the rest.\r\n\r\nWhere a bed or tabular mass of whinstone is interposed between strata,\r\nand wherever an opportunity offers of seeing its termination, if the\r\nstrata under it are not broken, it may be remarked, that they do not\r\nabut themselves bluff and abrupt against the whin. On the contrary,\r\nif we mark the course of the stratum which covers the whinstone, and\r\nof that which is the base of it, we shall find they converge toward\r\none another, the interposed mass growing thinner and thinner, like a\r\nwedge. When the latter terminates, the two former come in contact, and\r\nhave no stratum interposed between them. Thus the roof and base of the\r\nwhinstone rock are contiguous beds, that appear as if they had been\r\nlifted up and bent, and separated by an interposed mass. Had the whole\r\nbeen an effect of simultaneous deposition, the regular strata must have\r\nbeen abruptly terminated by the whin, like two courses of different\r\nforts of masonry where they meet with one another.\r\n\r\n260. From this wedge-form of the whinstone masses, and in general from\r\nthe irregularity of their surfaces, another conclusion follows, similar\r\nto the preceding, and one which has been already mentioned. Where the\r\nsurface of the interposed mass is greatly inclined to the horizon, the\r\nstrata which rest on this inclined plane, are nevertheless as exactly\r\nparallel to that plane, and to one another, as if they were really\r\nhorizontal. It is certain, therefore, that they were not deposited on\r\nthe same inclined plane on which they now rest; for, if so, they would\r\nhave been still nearly horizontal, and by no means parallel to the\r\ninclined side of the whinstone. This follows from the nature of aqueous\r\ndeposition, as already explained.\r\n\r\nWe have a remarkable instance of the phenomenon here referred to, in\r\nthe rock of Salisbury _Craig_, of which mention has been so often made,\r\nand in which almost every circumstance is united, that can serve to\r\nelucidate the natural history of basaltic rocks. The north end of that\r\nrock is in the figure of a wedge, with its inclined side considerably\r\nsteep, and covered by strata of grit, perfectly regular, and parallel\r\nto the surface on which they lie. The inspection of them will convince\r\nany one, that they were not deposited by the water, on a bottom so\r\nhighly inclined as that on which they now rest. They are of a structure\r\nvery schistose; their layers very thin; so that any inaccuracy of\r\ntheir parallelism would be readily observed. The appearances of the\r\nhorizontal deposition of these strata, are indeed so clear, and so\r\nimpossible to be misunderstood, that the followers of the Huttonian\r\nsystem would not risk much, if they were to leave the whole theory of\r\nwhinstone to the decision of this single fact, and should agree to\r\nabandon that theory altogether, if the Neptunists can shew any physical\r\nor statical principle, on which the deposition now described can\r\npossibly have been made; or will point out the rule, by which nature\r\nhas given a structure so nicely stratified to arenaceous beds deposited\r\non a surface so highly inclined. If no such principle can be pointed\r\nout, though we cannot conclude that the Huttonian Theory is true, we\r\ncertainly may conclude that the Neptunian is false.\r\n\r\n261. Proofs of the igneous formation of whinstone, still more direct,\r\nare derived from the induration of the contiguous strata; from their\r\ndisturbance when interfered by veins of whinstone; and from the\r\ncharring of the coal which happens to be in contact with these veins.\r\nThese are considered above at § 66, 67, &c.; and it is particularly\r\ntaken notice of at § 66, that pieces of sandstone are sometimes found\r\nas if floating in the whinstone, and, at the same time, greatly altered\r\nin their texture. One of the best and most unequivocal instances of\r\nthis sort which I have seen, is to be found on the south side of\r\n_Arthur's Seat_, near Edinburgh. The rock which composes the upper\r\npart of the hill, on that side, is a whinstone breccia, such as we have\r\nmany examples of, and, I believe, very much resembling what is called\r\na _lava brecciata_ by the volcanic geologists. The stony fragments\r\nincluded in this compound mass, are for the greater part rounded;\r\nand some of them are of whinstone, others of porphyry, strongly\r\ncharacterized by rectangular maculæ of feldspar, and many seem to be\r\nof sandstone, but so considerably altered, as to leave it at least\r\ndisputable whether they really are so or not. In one part, however,\r\nwhere the face of the rock is nearly perpendicular, a narrow ridge is\r\nseen standing out from the rest, and of a different colour, being more\r\nentirely covered with moss than the rock round about it, and, as may\r\nbe presumed from that circumstance, less liable to decomposition. On\r\nexamination I found, that this ridge does not consist of whinstone, but\r\nof a very hard and highly consolidated sandstone. It appears to be the\r\nedge of a stratum, of the thickness of about nine or ten inches, and of\r\nthe height of fifteen or sixteen feet. It is not perfectly straight,\r\nbut slightly waved, its general direction being nearly vertical; and\r\nit is on both sides firmly embraced by the whinstone. When broken, it\r\nappears that this sandstone resembles in colour, and in every thing\r\nbut its greater consolidation, and more vitreous structure, the common\r\ngrit found at the bottom of the hill, and over all the adjacent plain.\r\n\r\n262. If all these circumstances are put together, there appears but\r\none conclusion that can be drawn from them. We have here the manifest\r\nmarks of some power which could lift up this fragment of rock from its\r\nnative place, distant at least several hundred yards from its present\r\nsituation, place it upright on its edge, encompass it with a solid\r\nrock, of a nature quite heterogeneous to itself, and bestow on it, at\r\nthe same time, a great addition of solidity and induration. If the mass\r\nin which this stone is now imbedded, be supposed to have been once in\r\nfusion, and forcibly thrown up from below, invading the strata, and\r\ncarrying the fragments along with it, the whole phenomena now described\r\nadmit of an explanation, and all the circumstances accord perfectly\r\nwith one another; but, without this supposition, they are so many\r\nseparate prodigies, which have no connection with one another, nor with\r\nany thing that is known. It is indeed impossible, that the effects of\r\nmotion and heat can be more clearly expressed than they are here, or\r\nthe subject in which these powers resided more distinctly pointed out.\r\n\r\n263. The preceding facts being susceptible but of one interpretation,\r\nare on that account extremely valuable. The phenomena of Salisbury\r\n_Craig_, near the same place, are almost equally free from ambiguity.\r\nThe basaltic rock which forms that precipice, rests on arenaceous or\r\nmarly strata; and these, in their immediate contact with the former,\r\nafford an instance of what is mentioned § 67, namely, the conversion\r\nof the strata in such situations into a kind of petrosilex, or even\r\njasper. The line which separates the one rock from the other, is,\r\nat the same time, so well defined, as, in the eyes even of the most\r\ndetermined Neptunist, to exclude all idea of insensible gradation.\r\n\r\n264. The same rock affords some remarkable instances of the disturbance\r\nof the strata contiguous to the whinstone. The beds of the former are\r\nbent upwards in several places; and, at one in particular, form an\r\narch, with its convexity downward, so as to make it evident, that the\r\nforce which produced this bending was directed from below upwards.\r\n\r\n265. It is, however, where whinstone takes the form of veins,\r\nintersecting the strata, that the induration of the latter is most\r\nconspicuous. The coast of Ayrshire, and the opposite coast of Arran,\r\nexhibit these veins in astonishing variety and abundance. The strata\r\nare, in many instances, so _reticulated_ by the veins, and intersected\r\nat such small distances, that it seems necessary to suppose, that the\r\nfissures in them were hardly sooner made than filled up. This at least\r\nis true, if the veins are to be accounted all of the same formation;\r\nand, in the greatest number of instances by far, there is no mark of\r\nthe one being posterior to the other.\r\n\r\n266. The induration of the sides of these veins, in some cases, has\r\nbeen such, that the sides have become more durable than the vein\r\nitself; so that the whinstone has been worn away by the washing of the\r\nwaves, and has left the sides standing up, with an empty space, like\r\na _ditch_, between them. One of these I remarked on the south side of\r\nBrodick Bay, in Arran, which, where it met the face of an abrupt cliff\r\nwas not less than forty or fifty feet in depth.\r\n\r\n267. I shall pass over whatever argument might be drawn in favour\r\nof our system, from the slender ramifications of the veins, and\r\nthe varieties of their sizes, from a few inches to many fathoms in\r\ndiameter, and also from the connection which they often appear to have\r\nwith the great tabular masses of basaltes; and shall only add a few\r\nremarks on the charring of coal in the vicinity of veins or masses\r\nof whinstone. The connection between the charring of coal and the\r\npresence of whinstone, was first observed by Dr Hutton; and, as far as\r\nopportunities of verifying the observation have yet occurred, appears\r\nto be a fact no less general than it is curious and interesting. In the\r\ncoal mines of Scotland, it certainly holds remarkably, particularly in\r\nthose about Saltcoats in Ayrshire, where a whinstone dike is known to\r\nstretch across the whole of the coal country, and to be every where\r\naccompanied with blind or uninflammable coal. At Newcastle, dikes of\r\nthe same kind are met with, and one, in particular, in what is called\r\nthe _Walker_ Colliery, has proved the action of subterraneous fire, to\r\nthe satisfaction of mineralogists nowise prejudiced in favour of the\r\nHuttonian system.\r\n\r\nThe coal found under basaltes, in the Island of Sky, has been already\r\nmentioned, § 140. To what was said concerning the fibrous structure of\r\nthe parts of that fossil in immediate contact with the whin, it may be\r\nadded, that it is also charred in those parts, so as to have hardly\r\nany flame when it is burnt, though further down it is of the nature of\r\nordinary coal. Indeed, if there be any truth in Mr Kirwan's general\r\nremark, that it is common to find wood coal under basaltes, it must\r\nbe understood to arise from this, that the coal in contact with the\r\nbasaltes is frequently charred, and its fibrous structure, by that\r\nmeans, rendered more visible.\r\n\r\n268. It has been objected to the supposition of coal having its\r\nbituminous part driven off by the heat of the whinstone, that this\r\nought not, on Dr Hutton's principles, to happen in the mineral\r\nregions. But it may be replied, as has been done above, that the local\r\napplication of heat might certainly produce this effect, and might\r\ndrive off the volatile ports from a hotter to a colder part of the\r\nsame stratum. The bitumen has not been so volatilized and expanded as\r\nentirely to escape from the mineral regions; but it has been expelled\r\nfrom some parts of a mass, only to be condensed and concentrated in\r\nothers. This supposition coincides exactly with the appearances.\r\n\r\n269. The native or fossil coke which accompanies whinstone, has been\r\ndistinguished into two varieties. The first is the most common, in\r\nwhich, though the coal is perfectly charred, it is solid, and breaks\r\nwith a smooth and shining surface. The second is also perfect charcoal,\r\nbut is very porous and spongy. This substance is much rarer than the\r\nother. Dr Hutton mentions an instance of it at the mouth of the river\r\nAyr, where there is a whinstone dike.[137] I had the satisfaction of\r\nvisiting it along with him. It was in the bed of the river, below the\r\nhigh water mark; the specimens had the exact appearance of a _cinder_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 611.]\r\n\r\nIn the banks of the same river, some miles higher up, he found a piece\r\nof coal, belonging to a regular stratum, involved in whinstone, and\r\nextremely incombustible. It consumed very slowly in the fire, and\r\ndeflagrated with nitre like plumbago. This be considered as the same\r\nfossil which has been described under the name of _plombagine_. Near\r\nit, and connected with the same vein of whinstone, was a real and\r\nundoubted plumbago.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances he also concluded, that plumbago is the\r\nextreme of a gradation, of which fossil-coal is the beginning, and is\r\nnothing else than this last reduced to perfect charcoal This agrees\r\nwith the chemical analysis, which shows plumbago to be composed of\r\ncarbon, combined with iron.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this theory, he mentions a specimen, in his\r\npossession, of steatical whinstone, from Cumberland, containing nodules\r\nof a very perfect and beautiful plumbago; and he also takes notice of a\r\nmine of this last, in Ayrshire, which, on the authority of Dr Kennedy,\r\nwho has examined it with great care, I can state as being contained,\r\nor enveloped in whinstone; and I hope the public will soon be favoured\r\nwith a particular description of this very interesting spot, by the\r\nsame ingenious and accurate observer.\r\n\r\n270. Thus the mineralogical and chemical discoveries agree in\r\nrepresenting coal, blind coal, plombagine, plumbago, as all\r\nmodifications of the same substance, and as exhibiting the same\r\nprinciple, carbon, in a state of greater or less combination. As the\r\nlast and highest term of this series should be placed the _diamond_;\r\nbut we are yet unacquainted with the matrix of this curious fossil,\r\nand its geological relation to other minerals. When known, they will\r\nprobably give to this substance the same place in the geological, as in\r\nthe chemical arrangement: in the mean time, it is hardly necessary to\r\nremark, how well all the preceding facts agree with the hypothesis of\r\nthe igneous formation of whinstone, and how anomalous and unconnected\r\nthey appear, according to every other theory.\r\n\r\n271. Notwithstanding all this accumulated and unanswerable evidence\r\nfor the igneous formation of basaltes, a great objection would still\r\nremain to our theory, were it not for the very accurate and conclusive\r\nexperiments concerning the fusion of this fossil, referred to above, §\r\n75. A strong prejudice against the production of any thing like a real\r\nstone by means of fusion, had arisen, even among those mineralogists,\r\nwho were every day witnesses of the stony appearance assumed by\r\nvolcanic lava. They still maintained, on the authority of their own\r\nimperfect experiments, that nothing but glass can ever be obtained\r\nby the melting of earths or of stones, in whatever manner they are\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious naturalist, after describing a block of basaltes, in which\r\nhe discovered such appearances, as inclined him to admit its igneous\r\nconsolidation, rejects that hypothesis, merely from the imaginary\r\ninability of fire to give to any substance a stony character: \"Quelque\r\nmélange,\"says he, \"de terres que l'on suppose, quelque soit le degré\r\nde feu que l'on imagine, quelque soit le tems que l'on emploie, il est\r\ntrès certain que l'on n'obtiendra pas, par le seul fluide igné, ni\r\nbasalte, ni rien qui lui ressemble.\"[138]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Journal de Phys. tom. xlix. (1799,) p. 36.]\r\n\r\nSir James Hall's experiments have completely demonstrated the contrary\r\nof what is here asserted: they have added much to the evidence of the\r\nHuttonian system; and, independently of all theory, have narrowed the\r\ncircle of prejudice and error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE XV. § 83.\r\n\r\n                             _On Granite._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. _Granite Veins._\r\n\r\n272. It is said above, § 77, that granite is found in unstratified\r\nmasses, and in veins. In the former of these conditions, it constitutes\r\nentire mountains, and forms the central ridge of many of the greatest\r\nchains that traverse the surface of the earth. It is the granite of\r\nthis kind that has been most generally described by travellers and\r\nmineralogists. The veins have not been so much attended to, though\r\nthey are of peculiar importance for ascertaining the relation between\r\ngranite and other fossils.\r\n\r\n273. Though Dr Hutton was the first geologist who explained the nature\r\nof granite veins, and who observed with attention the phenomena\r\nwhich accompany them, he is not the first who has mentioned them. M.\r\nBesson found veins of this kind in the Limoges, in an argillaceous\r\nschistus, and unconnected, as far as appeared, with any large mass of\r\ngranite.[139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Journal de Phys. tom. xxix. p. 89.]\r\n\r\nSaussure met with granite veins in the Valorsine, but did not see them\r\ndistinctly. He ascribed them to infiltration.[140] The date of this\r\nobservation is in 1776: He afterwards discovered similar appearances at\r\nLyons.[141]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Voyage au Alpes, tom. i. § 598, 599.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _Ibid._ § 601.]\r\n\r\nWerner also, in enumerating the substances of which veins are formed,\r\nreckons granite as one of them.\r\n\r\n274. Veins of granite may be considered as of two kinds, according as\r\nthey are connected, or not connected apparently with any large mass of\r\ngranite, it is probable, that these two kinds of veins only differ in\r\nappearance, and that both are connected with masses of the same rock,\r\nthough that connection is visible in some instances, and invisible in\r\nothers. The distinction, however, whatever it be with respect to the\r\nthing observed, is real with respect to the observer; and, as it is\r\nright, in a description of facts, to avoid every thing hypothetical, I\r\nshall speak of these veins separately.\r\n\r\n275. Veins of granite, having no communication, so far as can be\r\ndiscovered, with any mass of the same rock, are found in the Western\r\nIslands of Scotland, peculiarly in that of Coll, where they traverse\r\nthe beds of gneiss and hornblende schistus, which compose the main\r\nbody of the island. They are sometimes several fathoms in thickness,\r\nobliquely intersecting the planes of the strata just mentioned, which\r\nare nearly vertical. In these veins the feldspar is predominant; it is\r\nvery highly crystallized, and of a beautiful flesh colour. Many smaller\r\nveins are also to be met with in the same place; but no large mass of\r\ngranite is found, either in this or the adjacent island of Tiree.\r\n\r\n276. The Portsoy granite, of which mention has been already made, §\r\n80, also constitutes a vein or dike, traversing a highly indurated\r\nmicaceous schistus, about a mile to the eastward of the little town\r\nof Portsoy, and not visibly connected with any large mass of the same\r\nkind. More dikes than one of this granite have been observed near the\r\nsame spot.\r\n\r\nA similar granite is likewise found inland, in the neighbourhood of\r\nHuntly, about eighteen miles south of Portsoy; but whether in the shape\r\nof a vein or a mass, I have not been able to learn.\r\n\r\n277. Veins of granite are also frequent in Cornwall, where they are\r\nknown by the name of _lodes_, the same name which is applied in that\r\ncountry to metallic veins. The granite veins frequently intersect\r\nthe metallic, and are remarkable for producing shifts in them, or\r\nfor throwing them out of their natural direction. The mineral veins,\r\nparticularly those that yield copper and tin, run nearly from east to\r\nwest, having the same direction with the beds of the rock itself, which\r\nis a very hard schistus. The granite lodes, as also those of porphyry,\r\ncalled _elvan_ in Cornwall, are at right angles nearly to the former;\r\nand it is remarked, that they generally heave the mineral veins, but\r\nthat the mineral veins seldom or never heave the cross-veins. In this\r\ncountry, therefore, the veins of granite and porphyry are posterior in\r\nformation to the metallic veins. These veins of granite may perhaps be\r\nconnected with the great granitic mass that runs longitudinally through\r\nCornwall, from Dartmoor to the Land's End. This much is certain, that\r\ntheir directions in general are such, that, if produced, they would\r\nintersect that mass, nearly at right angles.\r\n\r\n278. The granite veins in Glentilt, where Dr Hutton made his first\r\nobservations on this subject, are not, I believe, visibly connected\r\nwith any large mass of the same rock.[142] The bed of the river Tilt,\r\nin the distance of little more than a mile, is intersected by no\r\nless than six very powerful veins of granite, all of them accompanied\r\nwith such marks of disorder and confusion in the strata, as indicate\r\nvery strongly the violence with which the granite was here introduced\r\ninto its place. These veins very probably belong to the great mass\r\nof granite which is known to form the central ridge of the Grampians\r\nfurther to the north; but they are several miles distant from it, and\r\nthe connection is perhaps invisible in the present state of the earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Trans. Royal Society Edin. Vol iii. p. 77, &c.]\r\n\r\n279. The second kind of granite vein, is one which proceeds visibly\r\nfrom a mass of that rock, and penetrates into the contiguous strata.\r\nThe importance of this class of veins, for ascertaining the relation\r\nbetween granite and other mineral bodies, has been pointed out, §\r\n82; and by means of them it has been shown, that the granite, though\r\ninferior in position, is of more recent formation than the schistus\r\nincumbent on it; and that the latter, instead of having been quietly\r\ndeposited on the former, has been, long after its deposition and\r\nconsolidation, heaved up from its horizontal position, by the liquid\r\nbody of granite forcibly impelled against it from below.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged, in order to take off the force of the argument\r\nderived from granite veins, that these veins are formed by\r\ninfiltration, though, to give any probability to this supposition,\r\nit would be necessary to show, that water is able to dissolve the\r\ningredients of granite; and even if this could be done, the direction\r\nwhich the veins have, in many instances, rising up from the granite,\r\nis a proof, as remarked § 82, that they cannot be the effect of\r\ninfiltration.\r\n\r\nAnother objection has been thrown out, namely, that the veins here\r\nreferred to are not of true granite, according to the definition\r\nwhich mineralogists have given of that substance. The force of a\r\nfact, however, is not to be lessened by a change of names, or the\r\nuse of arbitrary definitions. The general fact is, that the granitic\r\nmass, and the vein proceeding from it, constitute one continuous,\r\nand uninterrupted body, without any line of separation between them.\r\nThe geological argument turns on this circumstance alone; and it is\r\nno matter whether the rock be a syenite, a granitelle, or a real\r\ngranite. The phenomenon speaks the same language, and leads to the same\r\nconclusion, whatever be the technical terms the mineralogist employs in\r\ndescribing it.\r\n\r\n280. It must, however, be admitted, that a difference of character is\r\noften to be observed between the granite mass and the veins proceeding\r\nfrom it; sometimes the substances in the latter are more highly\r\ncrystallized than in the former; sometimes, but more rarely, they are\r\nless crystallized, and, in some instances, an ingredient that enters\r\ninto the mass seems entirely wanting in the vein. These varieties,\r\nfor what we yet know, are not subject to any general rule; but they\r\nhave been held out as a proof, that the masses and the veins are not\r\nof the same formation. It may be answered, that a perfect similarity\r\nbetween substances that, on every hypothesis, must have crystallized\r\nin very different circumstances, is not always to be looked for; but\r\nthe most direct answer is, that this perfect similarity does sometimes\r\noccur, insomuch that, in certain instances, no difference whatsoever\r\ncan be discovered between the mass and the vein, but they consist of\r\nthe same ingredients, and have the same degree of crystallization. Some\r\ninstances of this are just about to be remarked.\r\n\r\n281. A strong objection to the supposed origin of granitic veins\r\nfrom infiltration, and indeed to their formation in any way but by\r\nigneous fusion, arises from the number of fragments of schistus, often\r\ncontained, and completely insulated in those veins. How these fragments\r\nwere introduced into the fissures of the schistus, and sustained till\r\nthey were surrounded by the matter deposited by water, is very hard\r\nto be conceived; but if they were carried in by the melted granite,\r\nnothing is more easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the places where the phenomena of granite\r\nveins may be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\n282. The island of Arran, remarkable for collecting into a very small\r\ncompass a great number of the most interesting facts of geology,\r\nexhibits many instances of the penetration of schistus by veins of\r\ngranite. A group of granite mountains occupies the northern extremity\r\nof the island, the highest of which, Goatfield, rises nearly to the\r\nheight of 3000 feet, and on the south side is covered with schistus\r\nto the height of 1100. From thence, the line of junction, or that\r\nat which the granite emerges from under the schistus, winds, so far\r\nas I was able to observe, round the whole group of mountains, with\r\nmany wavings and irregularities, rising sometimes to a greater, and\r\ndescending sometimes to a much lower level, than that just mentioned.\r\nAlong this line, particularly on the south, wherever the rock is laid\r\nbare, and cut into by the torrents, innumerable veins of granite are to\r\nbe seen entering into the schistus, growing narrower as they advance\r\ninto it; and being directed, in very many cases, from below upwards,\r\nthey are precisely of the kind which the infiltration of water could\r\nnot produce, even were that fluid capable of dissolving the substances\r\nwhich the vein consists of. From this south face of the mountain, and\r\nfrom the bed of a torrent that intersects it very deeply, Dr Hutton\r\nbrought a block of schistus, of several hundred weight, curiously\r\npenetrated by granite veins, including in them many insulated fragments\r\nof the schistus.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, the common section of the granite and schistus\r\ndescends towards the west side of the mountain, and is visible at the\r\nbottom of a deep glen, (Glen-Rosa,) which detaches Goatfield from the\r\nhills farther to the west. The junction is laid bare at several places\r\nin the bed of the river which runs in the bottom of this glen; and in\r\nall of them exhibits, in a greater or less degree, the appearances of\r\ndisturbance and violence which have accompanied the injection of the\r\ngranite veins. Many circumstances render this spot interesting to a\r\ngeologist, and, among others, an intersection of the granite, a little\r\nabove its junction with the schistus, by a dike or vein of very compact\r\nwhinstone.\r\n\r\nThe same line of junction is found on the opposite, or north-east, side\r\nof the mountain, where it is intersected by another little river, the\r\nSannax, which on this side determines the base of the mountain. This\r\njunction is no less remarkable than the other two.\r\n\r\nThe island of Arran contains, I have no doubt, many other spots where\r\nthese phenomena are to be seen; but I have had no opportunity of\r\nobserving them, nor do I find that Dr Hutton met with any others in his\r\nvisit to this island.\r\n\r\n283. Another series of granite veins is found in Galloway, which was\r\nfirst discovered by Dr Hutton and his friend Mr Clerk, and afterwards\r\nmore fully explored by Sir James Hall and Mr Douglas, the present Earl\r\nof Selkirk. The two last traced the line of separation between a mass\r\nof granite and the schistus incumbent upon it, all round a tract of\r\ncountry, about eleven miles by seven, extending from the banks of Loch\r\nKen westward; and in all this tract they found, \"that wherever the\r\njunction of the granite with the schistus was visible, veins of the\r\nformer, from fifty yards, to the tenth of an inch in width, were to be\r\nseen running into the latter, and pervading it in all directions, so\r\nas to put it beyond all doubt, that the granite of these veins, and\r\nconsequently of the great body itself, which was observed to form with\r\nthe veins one uninterrupted mass, must have flowed in a soft or liquid\r\nstate into its present position.\"[143] I have only farther to add, that\r\nsome of these veins are remarkable for containing granite, not sensibly\r\ndifferent, in any respect, from the mass from which they proceed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Trans. Royal Society Edin. vol. iii. p. 8.]\r\n\r\n284. In Invernessshire, between Bernera and Fort Augustus, the same\r\nphenomena occur on the north side of Loch Chloney, where some granite\r\nmountains rise from under the schistus. In travelling near this place,\r\nLord Webb Seymour and myself were advertised of our approach to a\r\njunction of granite and schistus, by finding among the loose stones on\r\nthe road many pieces of schistus, intersected with veins of feldspar\r\nand granite. We walked along this junction for more than a mile; and\r\ntoward the east end, where the road leaves it, we saw, in the bed of\r\na stream that runs into Loch Chloney, many beautiful specimens of\r\ngranitic veins pervading the schistus, and branching out into very\r\nminute ramifications.\r\n\r\n285. The last instance I have to mention from my own observation, is\r\nat St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. That mount is entirely of granite,\r\nthrust up from under a very hard micaceous schistus, which surrounds\r\nit on all sides. At the base of it, on the west side, a great number\r\nof veins run off from the granite, and spread themselves like so many\r\nroots fixed in the schistus: they are seen at low water. In the smaller\r\nveins, the granite is of very minute, though distinct parts; in the\r\nlarger, it is more highly crystallized, and is undistinguishable from\r\nthe mass of the hill.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, Cornwall probably affords many other instances of\r\nthe same kind, which I have not had an opportunity to examine. Such\r\ninstances may in particular be looked for at the Land's End, where a\r\npromontory, consisting of a central part of granite, and covered by\r\na micaceous schistus on both sides of it, is cut transversely by the\r\nsea coast, and the contact of the granite and schistus of course twice\r\nexposed to view.\r\n\r\n286. Scotland also affords other examples of granite veins, and some\r\nof them have been actually described. Mr Jameson has taken notice of\r\nsome which he saw in the bottom of the river Spey, at Glen Drummond, in\r\nBadenach, and has represented them in an engraving.[144] They traverse\r\nthe strata in various directions, and inclose pieces of the micaceous\r\nschistus; and, from the great number of loose blocks which he found,\r\nexhibiting portions of such veins, it is probable, that they are very\r\nnumerous in this quarter. The same mineralogist mentions some instances\r\nof similar veins in the Shetland Isles.[145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles, vol. ii. p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: _Ibid._ p. 216.]\r\n\r\nIn Ross-shire, Sir George Mackenzie has observed a great variety of\r\ngranite veins, some of them of large size. One of them, in particular,\r\nnot far from Coul, when first discovered, was supposed to be a\r\nsingle mass, rising from under the schistus; but, on a more careful\r\nexamination, has been found to be a part of a great system of veins\r\nwhich intersects the micaceous schistus of this tract in various\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n287. The granite veins are not the only proof that this stone is more\r\nrecent than some other productions of the mineral kingdom. Specimens\r\nof granite are often found, containing round nodules of other stones,\r\nas, for example, of gneiss or micaceous schistus. Such is the specimen\r\nof granite containing gneiss, which Werner himself is said to be in\r\npossession of, and to consider as a proof, that the schistus is of\r\ngreater antiquity than the granite. Such also seemed to me some pieces\r\nof granite, which I met with in Cornwall, near the Land's End; and\r\nothers which I saw in Ayrshire, in loose blocks, on the sea coast\r\nbetween Ayr and Girvan. It is impossible to deny that the containing\r\nstone is more modern than the contained. The Neptunists indeed admit\r\nthis to be true, but allege, that all granite is not of the same\r\nformation; and that, though some granite is recent, the greater part\r\nboasts of the highest antiquity which belongs to any thing in the\r\nfossil kingdom. This distinction, however, is purely hypothetical; it\r\nis a fiction contrived on purpose to reconcile the fact here mentioned\r\nwith the general system of aqueous deposition, and has no support from\r\nany other phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. _Granite of Portsoy._\r\n\r\n288. The granite of Portsoy is one of the most singular varieties of\r\nthis stone, and is remarkable for this circumstance, that the feldspar\r\nis the substance which has assumed the figure of its proper crystal,\r\nand has given its form to the quartz, so that the latter is impressed\r\nboth with the acute and obtuse angles belonging to the rhombic figure\r\nof the former. The angular pieces of quartz thus moulded on the\r\nfeltspar, and ranged by means of it in rows, give to this stone the\r\nappearance of rude alphabetical writing.\r\n\r\nNow, Dr Hutton argued, that substances precipitated from a solution,\r\nand crystallizing at liberty, cannot be supposed to impress one another\r\nin the manner here exemplified; and that they could do so only when\r\nthe whole mass acquired solidity at the same time, or at the same time\r\nnearly.[146] Such simultaneous consolidation can be produced in no way\r\nthat we know of, but by the cooling of a mass that has been in fusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. P. 104.]\r\n\r\n289. A granite, brought from Daouria by M. PATRIN, and described by him\r\nin the Journal de Physique for 1791, p. 295, under the name of _pierre\r\ngraphique_, seemed to Dr Hutton to have so great a resemblance to the\r\ngranite of Portsoy, that he ventured to consider them both as the same\r\nstone, and as both containing quartz moulded on feltspar.[147] It\r\nshould seem, however, from further explanations, which M. Patrin has\r\nsince given, but Dr Hutton was mistaken in his conjecture, and that, in\r\nthe _pierre graphique_ of the former mineralogist, the quartz gives its\r\nform to the feltspar, preserving in its crystals their natural angle of\r\n120 degrees[148] It is impossible, I think, to doubt of the accuracy\r\nof this statement; and the graphical stone of Portsoy must therefore\r\nbe admitted to differ materially from that of Daouria. They are not,\r\nhowever, without some considerable affinity, besides that of their\r\noutward appearance; for, though the quartz in the former is generally\r\nmoulded on the feltspar, the feldspar is also occasionally impressed by\r\nthe quartz, and sometimes even included in it. They may be considered\r\nas varieties of the same species of granite; and the _pierre graphique_\r\nof Corsica is probably a third variety, different from them both.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Trans. Royal Society Edin. vol. iii. p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Journal Britainnique, (of Geneva,) 1798, vol. viii.\r\nSciences et Arts, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n290. It would seem, however, that all these stones lead exactly to\r\nthe same conclusion. M. Patrin describes his specimen as containing\r\nquartz crystals, that are for the most part only _cases_, having their\r\ninterior filled with feltspar \"Le feltspath en masse contient des\r\ncrysteaux quartzeux, qui n'ont le plus souvent que la carcasse, et dont\r\nl'interieur est rempli de feltspath; souvent il manque à ces carcasses\r\nquelques unes de leurs faces, et souvent la section de cette pierre\r\ndans un sens transversal aux crysteaux, presente une suite de figures\r\nqui sont des portions d'hexagones, et qui ne resemblent pas mal à des\r\ncaractères Hebraiques.\"[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Journal Britannique, _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThese imperfect hexagonal cases of quartz, filled with feldspar,\r\ncertainly indicate the crystallization of substances, which all\r\nassumed their solidity at the same time, and, in doing so, constrained\r\nthe figures of one another. To use the words of Dr Hutton, \"whether\r\ncrystallizing quartz inclose a body of feltspar, or concreting feltspar\r\ndetermine the shape of fluid quartz, particularly if we have, as is\r\nhere the case, two solid bodies including and included, it amounts to\r\na demonstration, that those bodies have concreted from a fluid state\r\nof fusion, have not crystallized, in the manner of salts, from a\r\nsolution.\"[150]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Trans. Royal Society Edin. _ubi supra_, p. 84.]\r\n\r\n291. The quartz in granite so generally receives the impressions of\r\nall the other substances, particularly of the feldspar and schorl,\r\nand appears to be so passive a body, that it has been doubted by some\r\nmineralogists, whether in this stone it ever assumes its own figure,\r\nexcept where cavities afford room for its crystallization. But it\r\nis certain that, beside the Daourian granite just mentioned, there\r\nare others, in which the quartz is completely crystallized. Of this\r\nsort are some specimens, found in a granite vein on the west side of\r\nthe hill of St Agnes, in Cornwall. The vein traverses the primitive\r\nschistus, of which that hill consists, from south to north nearly:\r\nthe stone is much decomposed, and the feldspar in general is almost\r\nreduced to the state of clay. In this decomposed mass, quartz crystals\r\nare found, having the shape of double hexagonal pyramids, perfectly\r\nregular and complete. The side of the hexagon, which is the base of the\r\ntwo opposite pyramids, varies from half a tenth to a tenth of an inch\r\nin length, and is the same with the altitude of each of the pyramids.\r\nIn some few specimens, the two pyramids do not rest on the same base,\r\nbut are separated by a very short, though regular, hexagonal prism.\r\nThe surfaces of these crystals are rough, and somewhat opaque, with\r\nslender spiculæ of schorl frequently traversing them. This roughness\r\nis occasioned by slight furrows on the surface of the crystal, very\r\nregularly disposed, and parallel to one another, being without doubt\r\nimpressions from the thin plates of the feldspar, which surrounded\r\nthe crystal, and slightly indented it. They very much resemble some\r\nimpressions, remarked by Dr Hutton in the granite of Portsoy, and\r\nascribed by him also to a similar cause. He has represented these in\r\nhis Theory of the Earth, vol. i. plate ii. fig. 4. The action and\r\nreaction of two crystallizing bodies, hardly admits of a stronger and\r\nmore unequivocal expression, than in these two instances.\r\n\r\nWhere the granite was little decomposed, the quartz was not easily\r\ndisengaged from the mass it was imbedded in, and often broke in pieces\r\nbefore it could be extricated. The crystallization of the quartz,\r\ntherefore, would not have been discovered, but for the decomposition of\r\nthe feltspar; and it is probable, that similar crystallizations exist\r\nin many granites where they are not perceived.\r\n\r\n292. Some mineralogists are inclined to think, that the regular\r\ncrystallization of quartz is to be found only in what they call\r\nsecondary granites, or in those that are of a formation subsequent\r\nto the great masses which constitute the granite mountains. It is\r\nindeed true, that in the instances given here, both from Cornwall and\r\nDaouria, the granites containing quartz crystals are from veins that\r\nintersect the primary schistus, and are therefore, on every hypothesis,\r\nof a formation subsequent to that schistus. But it does not follow\r\nfrom thence, that they are less ancient than the great masses of\r\nunstratified granite; with these last they are most probably coëval,\r\nnor can there be any reason for thinking the crystallization of quartz\r\na mark of more recent formation than that of feltspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    3. _Stratification of Granite._\r\n\r\n293. What are the various modes in which granite exists, is a question\r\nnot absolutely decided among mineralogists. 1. That it exists as a\r\nschistose stone of a fissile texture, in gneiss and _veined granite_,\r\nis on all hands admitted, though in this state the name of granite\r\nis generally withheld from it. 2. That it exists often without any\r\nindication of a fissile texture, and altogether unstratified, is\r\nlikewise acknowledged. 3. That it is found in veins, intersecting\r\nthe strata, has been shown above. The only mode of its existence\r\nsubject to dispute, is that in which it is said to be stratified in\r\nits outward configuration, but not schistose in its texture. On this\r\npoint mineralogists do not perfectly agree: Dr Hutton did not think\r\nthat this was a state in which granite ever appears. When not schistose\r\nin its structure, he supposed it to be unstratified altogether; and\r\nhe considered it as a body which, like whinstone, was originally in\r\na state of igneous fusion, and, in that condition, injected among\r\nthe strata. The school of Werner, on the other hand, maintain, that\r\ngranite, if not always, is generally stratified, and disposed in beds,\r\nsometimes horizontal, though more frequently vertical, or highly\r\ninclined.\r\n\r\nIn forming an opinion where there are great authorities on opposite\r\nsides, a man must trust chiefly to his own observations, and ought\r\nto esteem himself fortunate if these lead to any certain conclusion.\r\nMine incline me to differ from Dr Hutton, on the one hand, and from\r\nthe Neptunists, on the other, as they convince me, that granite does\r\nform strata where it has no character of gneiss; and, at the same\r\ntime, induce me to suspect, that the stratification ascribed by the\r\nNeptunists to the granite mountains, is, in many instances, either an\r\nillusion, or at least something very different from what, in other\r\nstones, is accounted stratification.\r\n\r\n294. The first example I ever saw of granite that was stratified,\r\nand yet had no character of gneiss, was at Chorley Forest, in\r\nLeicestershire. The greater part of that forest has for its base a\r\nhornstone schistus, primary and vertical; and, on its eastern border,\r\nparticularly near Mount Sorrel, are beds of granite, holding the same\r\ndirection with those of the schistus. The stone is a real granite;\r\nit has nothing in its internal structure of a schistose or fissile\r\nappearance; and its beds, which it is material to remark, are no\r\nthicker than those of the hornstone strata in the neighbourhood. This\r\ngranite is remarkable, too, for being close to the secondary sandstone\r\nstrata; I did not see their contact, but traced them within a small\r\ndistance of one another; so that I think it is not likely that any body\r\nof rock intervenes. At the same time that I state my belief of this\r\nrock of granite being in regular strata, I must acknowledge, that a\r\nvery intelligent mineralogist, who viewed these rocks at the same time,\r\nand whose eye was well practised in geological observation, remained in\r\ndoubt concerning them.\r\n\r\n295. Another instance of a real granite, disposed in regular beds, but\r\nwithout any character of gneiss, is one which I saw in Berwickshire,\r\nin Lammermuir, near the village of Priestlaw. The little river of\r\nFassnet cuts the beds across, and renders it easy to observe their\r\nstructure. The beds are not very thick; they run from about S.S.W. to\r\nN.N.E. like the schistus on either side of them. I was in company with\r\nSir James Hall when I saw these rocks; we examined them with a good\r\ndeal of attention, and traced them for more than a mile in the bed of\r\nthe river; and, if I mistake not, our opinions concerning them were\r\nprecisely the same.\r\n\r\n296. What exists in two instances may exist in many, and, after these\r\nobservations, I should be guilty of great inconsistency, in refusing\r\nto assent to the accounts of Pallas, De Luc, Saussure, and many other\r\nmineralogists, who so often represent granite as formed into strata.\r\nIn some cases, however, it is certain, that the stratification they\r\ndescribe is extremely unlike that in the two instances just mentioned,\r\nand indeed very unlike any thing that is elsewhere known by the name\r\nof stratification. For example, the stratification must be very\r\nambiguous, and very obscurely marked, that was not discovered till\r\nafter a series of observations, continued for more than twenty years,\r\nby a very skilful and distinguishing mineralogist. Yet such undoubtedly\r\nis the stratification of Mont Blanc, and of the granite mountains in\r\nits neighbourhood, as it escaped the eyes of Saussure, in the repeated\r\nvisits which he made to them, during a period of no less extent than\r\nhas just been mentioned. It was not till near the conclusion of those\r\nlabours, to which the geologists of every age will consider themselves\r\nas highly indebted, that, having reached the summit of Mont Blanc, he\r\nperceived, or thought that he perceived, the stratification of the\r\ngranite mountains. The _Aiguilles_ or Needles which border the valley\r\nof Chamouni, and even Mont Blanc itself, appeared to be formed of vast\r\ntabular masses of granite, in position nearly vertical, and so exactly\r\nparallel, that he did not hesitate to call them by the name of strata.\r\nTill this moment, these same mountains, viewed from a lower point,\r\nhad been regarded by him as composed of great plates of rock, nearly\r\nvertical indeed, but applied, as it were, round an axis, and resembling\r\nthe leaves of an artichoke;[151] and the fissures by which they are\r\nseparated from one another, had been considered as effects of waste and\r\ndegradation. \"But now,\" (says he, speaking of the view from the top of\r\nMont Blanc,) \"I was fully convinced, that these mountains are entirely\r\ncomposed of vast plates of granite, perpendicular to the horizon, and\r\ndirected from N.E. to S.W. Three of these plates, separated from each\r\nother, formed the top of the _Aiguille du Midi_, and other similar\r\nplates, decreasing gradually in height, compose its declivity to the\r\nsouth.\"[152]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. ii. § 910, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1996.]\r\n\r\n297. Saussure was so strongly impressed with the appearances of what\r\nhe accounted regular stratification, such as water only can produce,\r\nand such as must have been in the beginning horizontal, that, placed\r\nas he now was, on one of the highest points of the earth's surface, he\r\nformed the bold conception, that the summit on which he was standing\r\nhad been once buried under the surface, to the depth at least of half\r\nthe diameter of the mountain, and horizontally distant from its present\r\nplace by a line not less than the whole height of the mountain; the\r\ngranite beds which compose that mountain, having been raised by some\r\nenormous power from their horizontal position, and turned as on an\r\naxis, till they were brought into the vertical plane. In this notion,\r\nwhich suits so well with the nature of mountains really composed of\r\nvertical strata, and which does credit to the extent of Saussure's\r\nviews, it is wonderful that he did not see the overthrow of the\r\ngeological system be had adopted, which is provided with no means\r\nwhatsoever of explaining these great effects.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the ideas suggested to Saussure, by viewing the\r\nmountains of the Alps from the highest of their summits. His great\r\nexperience, his accurate knowledge of the objects before him, and the\r\npower he had acquired of dissipating those illusions, to which, in\r\nviewing mountainous tracts, the eye is peculiarly subject, all conspire\r\nto give great weight to his opinion. Yet, as this opinion is opposed\r\nby that which he himself had so long entertained, before it can be\r\nreceived with perfect confidence, it will require to be verified by new\r\nobservations. It seems certain, that the beds of rock here described,\r\ndiffer from all ordinary strata, both horizontal and vertical, in the\r\ncircumstance of their vast thickness, three of them being so large as\r\nto form the main body of a mountain. Their parallelism cannot easily\r\nbe ascertained; and they have at best but a very slight resemblance to\r\nsuch beds as water is known to produce.\r\n\r\n298. Their parallelism is difficult to be ascertained; for, on account\r\nof the magnitude and inaccessibility of the objects, it is impossible\r\nto place the eye in any situation, where it shall not be much nearer to\r\none part of the planes whereof the parallelism is to be estimated, than\r\nto another. Indeed, one can perceive a cause which may have rendered\r\nthe parallelism of the plates of granite which compose the _aiguilles_,\r\nmore accurate in appearance than in reality, when viewed from a point\r\nso elevated as the summit of Mont Blanc. For, even on the supposition\r\nthat the comparison of those plates to leaves of artichokes was just,\r\nand that the planes of their separation converged toward one another,\r\nin ascending to the top, when they were viewed from a point more\r\nelevated than that top, this convergency would be diminished, and, by\r\nthe force of the perspective, might even be converted into parallelism.\r\nWe cannot at present ascertain what effect this cause of deception may\r\nhave actually produced.\r\n\r\n299. The observations of Saussure concerning the stratification\r\nof granite, are not, however, in all instances, liable to these\r\nobjections; and it seems to be on much less exceptionable grounds\r\nthat he pronounces the granite of St Gothard to be stratified. The\r\ngneiss and micaceous schistus which constitute the lower part of that\r\nmountain, are succeeded by a granite without any schistose appearance,\r\nbut divided into large plates, exactly parallel to the beds of the\r\nformer gneiss. These he regards as real strata. On studying them in\r\ndetail, he says, considerable irregularities were to be observed, but\r\nnot greater than in the case of limestone or micaceous schistus.[153]\r\nIt may be inferred from this, that these plates of granite are not so\r\nthick but that they admit of comparison with beds that are known with\r\ncertainty to be of aqueous formation, and I am therefore disposed to\r\nbelieve, that the granite of St Gothard, in this part at least, is\r\nstratified. The transition from gneiss to granite en masse, is not\r\nuncommon, as Saussure has observed in other instances, and as we are\r\njust about to consider more particularly.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1830.]\r\n\r\n300. In the mountains of our own country, some difficulties concerning\r\nthe stratification of granite have also occurred. In Arran, for\r\ninstance, the mountain of Goatfield, which I have mentioned above\r\nas affording an instance of granite sending out many veins into\r\nthe schistus, and rivetted, as it were, by means of them to the\r\nsuperincumbent rock, when I visited it, with, a view of verifying\r\non the spot the interesting observations which Dr Hutton had there\r\nmade, appeared to me to be without any vestige of stratification in\r\nits granitic part, as did also the whole group of mountains to which\r\nit belongs. It was, therefore, not without a good deal of surprise,\r\nthat I lately read, in an account of that island, by a very accurate\r\nand ingenious mineralogist, that Goatfield consists of stratified\r\ngranite.[154] The impression which the appearance of that mountain\r\nmade on my mind, is just the reverse; and though I saw large tabular\r\nmasses, sometimes nearly vertical, separated by fissures, they\r\nappeared to be much too irregular, too little extended in length and\r\nheight, and vastly too much in thickness, to be reckoned the effects\r\nof stratification. For all this, I would by no means be understood\r\nto set my observations in opposition to those of Mr Jameson. In my\r\nvisit to Arran, I did not direct my inquiries much toward this point;\r\nthe general appearance of the rocks did not suggest the necessity of\r\ndoing so, and I was not perfectly aware how much the stratification of\r\ngranite had been insisted on by some mineralogists; so that I applied\r\nmyself entirely to study some other of the interesting phenomena which\r\nthis little island offers in so great abundance. I therefore carry\r\nmy confidence in the appearances which seemed to indicate a want of\r\nstratification in the granite of Arran no further than to remain\r\nsceptical both as to Mr Jameson's conclusions and my own, till an\r\nopportunity shall occur of verifying the one or the other by actual\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles, vol. i. p. 35, 36.]\r\n\r\n301. The stratification of granite, though it made no part of Dr\r\nHutton's system, does by no means embarrass his theory with any new\r\ndifficulty. Rocks, of which the parts are highly crystallized, are\r\nalready admitted as belonging to the strata, and are exemplified in\r\nmarble, gneiss, and veined granite. In the two last, we have not only\r\nstratification, but a schistose, united with a crystallized structure,\r\nand the effects of deposition by water, and of fluidity by fire, are\r\ncertainly no where more singularly combined. The stratification of\r\nthese substances is therefore more extraordinary than even that of the\r\nmost highly crystallized granite. Neither the one nor the other can be\r\nexplained but by supposing, that while such a degree of fluidity was\r\nproduced by heat, as enabled the body when it cooled to crystallize,\r\nthe whole mass was kept in its place by great pressure acting on all\r\nsides, so that the shape was preserved as originally given to it by\r\nthe sea. As we cannot, however, suppose, that the intensity of the\r\nheat, or the fusibility of the substance through all the parts of a\r\nstratum, were precisely the same, we may expect to find in the same\r\nstratum, or in the same body of strata, that in some parts the marks\r\nof stratification are completely obliterated while in others they\r\nremain entire. It is thus that _veined granite_, of what I think should\r\nbe called granitic schistus, often graduates into granite _in mass_,\r\nthat is, granite without any schistose or fissile texture. Saussure\r\nsays, that to be veined or not veined, is an affection of granite,\r\nthat seems, in many cases, accidental;[155] as, in the midst of rocks\r\nof that substance, most clearly fissile, large portions appear without\r\nany vestige of stratification. Of this phenomenon, which is frequent\r\nin the Alps, instances are also to be met with in the granite rocks\r\nof Scotland, and the adjacent isles; and I know that Dr Hope, in a\r\nmineralogical excursion which he lately made among the Hebrides,\r\nobserved many interesting and curious examples of it. Indeed, when\r\nrocks were so much fused as to crystallize, and so compressed, at the\r\nsame time, as to remain stratified, they were evidently on the verge of\r\nchange; two opposite forces were very nearly balanced, and each carried\r\nas far as it could go without entirely overcoming the other; so that\r\na small alteration in the conditions may have made a great alteration\r\nin the effects. Hence a sudden transition from a stratified to an\r\nunstratified texture, which is only found in rocks highly crystallized,\r\nand such as have endured the most violent action of the mineralizing\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 2143.]\r\n\r\n302. Now, though the stratification of granite, or the mixture of the\r\nstratified with the unstratified rocks of that genus, is not only\r\nreconcilable with the principles of the Huttonian geology, but might\r\neven have been deduced as a corollary from those principles, before\r\nit was actually observed, it may be considered as inconsistent with\r\nthe theory of granitic veins that has just been given. A stratum,\r\nthough soft or fluid, could not invade the surrounding strata with\r\nviolence, nor send out veins to penetrate into them. It might, if,\r\nstrongly compressed by another stratum less fluid than itself, fill up\r\nany fissures or cracks that were in that other, but this would hardly\r\nproduce, such large veins, and of such considerable length, as often:\r\npenetrate from the granite into the schistus, nor could it give rise\r\nto any appearance of disturbance. If, therefore, veins were found\r\nproceeding from such stratified granite as that of Chorley Forest or\r\nLammermuir, I should think, that the explanation of them was still a\r\n_desideratum_ in geology. The Neptunian theory of infiltration would\r\nindeed be as applicable to them as to any other veins; for it is but\r\nlittle affected by the condition of the phenomena to be explained.\r\nIndeed, it is very difficult to set any limits to the explanations\r\nwhich this theory affords; and it would certainly puzzle a Neptunist,\r\nto assign any good reason why infiltration has not produced veins of\r\none schistus running into another, or veins of schistus running into\r\ngranite, as well as of granite running into, schistus. He will find it\r\na hard task to restrain the activity of his theory, and to confine its\r\nexplanations to those things that really exist.\r\n\r\n303. As the Huttonian system cannot boast of theories of equal\r\nversatility, it would be not a little embarrassed to account for veins\r\nof great magnitude proceeding from a rock distinctly stratified, and\r\naccompanied with marks of having disturbed the rocks through which they\r\npass. I am, however, inclined to believe, that this embarrassment will\r\nnever occur; and that the granite veins do not proceed from the rocks\r\nthat are really stratified, but from such as have never been deposited\r\nby water, and where the appearances of stratification, if there are\r\nany, are altogether illusory. This anticipation, however, requires to\r\nbe verified by future observation; and it remains to be seen, whether\r\ngranitic veins ever accompany real granitic strata, or are peculiar to\r\nthose in which the appearances of regular beds are either ambiguous,\r\nor are entirely wanting. The decision of this question is an object\r\nhighly worthy of the attention of geologists.\r\n\r\n304. An argument, directed at once against the igneous origin and\r\nunstratified nature of all granite, is given in a work already\r\nmentioned. \"If granite had flowed from below, how does it happen, that,\r\nafter it had burst through the strata of micaceous schistus, &c. it did\r\nnot overflow the neighbouring country? If this hypothesis were true,\r\nMont Blanc could never have existed.\"[156]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles, vol. ii. p. 166.]\r\n\r\nA theory is never more unfairly dealt with, than when those parts\r\nare separated which were meant to support one another, and each left\r\nto stand or fall by itself. This, however, is precisely what is done\r\nin the present instance; for Dr Hutton's theory of granite would\r\nnot deserve a moment's consideration, if it were so inartificially\r\nconstructed, as to suppose that granite was originally fluid, and yet\r\nto point out no means of hindering this fluid from diffusing itself\r\nover the strata, and settling in a horizontal plane. The truth is, that\r\nhis theory, at the same time that it conceives this stone to have been\r\nin fusion, supposes it to have been, in that state, injected among the\r\nstrata already consolidated; to have heaved them up, and to have been\r\nformed in the concavity so produced, as in a mould. Thus Mont Blanc,\r\nsupposing that it is unstratified, is understood to consist of a mass\r\nthat was melted by subterraneous heat under the strata, and being\r\nimpelled upwards by a force, that may stand in some comparison with\r\nthat which projected the planets in their orbits, heaved up the strata\r\nby which it was covered, and in which it remained included on all sides.\r\n\r\n305. The covering of strata, thus raised up, may have been burst\r\nasunder at the summit, where the curvature and elevation were the\r\ngreatest; but the melted mass underneath may have already acquired\r\nsolidity, or may have been sustained by the beds of schistus incumbent\r\non its sides. This schistus, forming the exterior crust, was\r\nimmediately acted on by the causes of waste and decomposition, which\r\nhave long since stripped the granite of a great part of its covering,\r\nand are now exercising their power on the central mass. That even Mont\r\nBlanc itself, as well as other unstratified mountains, was once covered\r\nwith schistus, will appear to have in it nothing incongruous, when we\r\nconsider the height to which the schistus still rises on its sides,\r\nor in the adjacent mountains; and when we reflect, that, from the\r\nappearances of waste and degradation which these mountains exhibit, it\r\nis certain, that the schistus must have reached much higher than it\r\ndoes at present.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that when the corresponding parts are brought\r\ntogether, and placed in their natural order, no room is left for the\r\nreproach, that this system is inconsistent with the _existence_ of\r\ngranite mountains. I have no pleasure in controversial writing; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the advantages which a weak attack always gives to a\r\ndefender, I cannot but regret, that Dr Hutton's adversaries have been\r\nso much more eager to refute than to understand his theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n306. A remark which Dr Hutton has made on the quantity of granite that\r\nappears at the surface, compared with that of other mineral bodies,\r\nhas been warmly contested. Having affirmed, that the greater part of\r\nrocks bear marks of being formed from the waste and decomposition of\r\nother rocks, he alleges that granite, (a stone which does not contain\r\nsuch marks) does not, for as much as appears from actual observation,\r\nmake up a tenth, nor perhaps even a hundredth part of the mineral\r\nkingdom.[157] Mr Kirwan contends, that this is a very erroneous\r\nestimate, and that the quantity of granite visible on the surface, far\r\nexceeds what is here supposed.[158] The question is certainly of no\r\nmaterial importance to the establishment of Dr Hutton's theory: it is\r\nevident, too, that an estimation, which varies so much as from a tenth\r\nto a hundredth part, cannot have been meant as any thing precise; yet\r\nit may not be quite superfluous to show, that the truth probably lies\r\nnearer to the least than the greatest of the limits just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Theory of the Earth, vol. i. p. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Geol. Essays, p. 480.]\r\n\r\n307. Though granite forms a part, generally the central part, of all\r\nthe great chains of mountains, it usually occupies a much less extent\r\nof surface than the primary schistus. Thus in the Alps, if a line be\r\ndrawn from Geneva to Ivrea, it will be about eighty-five geographical\r\nmiles in length, and will measure the breadth of this formidable\r\nchain of mountains, at the place of its greatest elevation. Now, from\r\nthe observations of Saussure, who crossed the Alps exactly in this\r\ndirection, it may be collected, that less than nine miles of this line,\r\nor not above a tenth part of it, in the immediate vicinity of Mont\r\nBlanc, is occupied by granite.\r\n\r\n308. In some sections of the Alps, no granite at all appears. Thus, in\r\nthe route from Chambery to Turin, across Mont Cenis, which measures by\r\nthe road not less than ninety miles, no granite is found, at least of\r\nthat kind which is distinctly in mass, and different from gneiss or\r\nveined granite.[159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1190, &c.]\r\n\r\n309. In some other places of the same mountains, the granite is more\r\nabundant. A line from the lake of Thun, along the course of the Aar,\r\nand over the mountains to the upper end of Lago Maggiore, crosses a\r\nvery elevated tract, and passes by the sources of the Rhone, the Rhine,\r\nand the Tessino, which last runs into the Po. A good deal of granite is\r\ndiscovered here, in the mountains of Grimsel and St Gothard; but by far\r\nthe greater part of it is the veined granite, the granite in mass being\r\nconfined chiefly to the north side of the Grimsel. Both together do not\r\noccupy more than one-third of the line, and therefore the latter less\r\nthan one-sixth.\r\n\r\n310. The essay on the mineralogy of the Pyrenees, by the Abbé PALASSO,\r\ncontains a mineralogical chart of those mountains. From this chart I\r\nhave found, by computation, that the granite does not occupy one-fifth\r\nof the horizontal surface on the north side of the ridge, reckoning\r\nfrom one end of it to the other. Indeed, many great tracts, even of the\r\ncentral parts of the Pyrenees, contain no granite whatsoever; and not a\r\nfew of the highest mountains consist entirely of calcareous schistus.\r\nA large deduction should be made from the fraction 1/5 on account of\r\nthe substances unknown, which, from the construction of the chart, are\r\noften confounded with the granitic tract.\r\n\r\n311. I might add other estimations of the same kind, all confessedly\r\nrude and imperfect, but still conveying, by means of numbers, a better\r\nidea of the limit to which our knowledge approximates, than could be\r\ndone simply by words; and, on the whole, it would appear, that if we\r\nstate the proportion of granite to schistus to be that of one to four,\r\nwe shall certainly do no injustice to the extent of the former.\r\n\r\nIt remains to form a rough estimate from maps, and from the accounts\r\nof travellers, of what proportion of the earth's surface consists\r\nof primary, and what of secondary rocks. After supplying the want\r\nof accurate measurement by what appeared to me the most probable\r\nsuppositions, I have found, that about 1/18 of the surface of the old\r\ncontinent may be conceived to be occupied by primitive mountains; of\r\nwhich, if we take one-fifth, we have 1/90 for the part of the surface\r\noccupied by granite rocks, which differs not greatly from the least of\r\nthe two limits assigned by Dr Hutton.\r\n\r\n312. In estimating the granite of Scotland, Dr Hutton has certainly\r\nerred considerably in defect,[160] and Mr Kirwan, who always differs\r\nfrom him, is here nearest the truth; though he is right purely by\r\naccident, as the information on which he proceeds is vague and\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Dr Hutton in this case no doubt made a very loose\r\nestimate. He says, the granite does not perhaps occupy more than a\r\n500dth part of the whole surface. The whole surface of Scotland is not\r\nmuch more than 23,000 geographical miles, the 500dth part of which is\r\nexactly 46; and this is exceeded by the granite in Kirkcudbrightshire\r\ndone, as may be gathered from what is said § 283.]\r\n\r\nThe places in Scotland where granite is found, are very well known; but\r\nthe extent of some of the most considerable of them is not accurately\r\nascertained. In the southern parts, except the granite of Galloway,\r\nwhich is found in two pretty large insulated tracts, there is no\r\nother of any magnitude. The granite of the north extends over a large\r\ndistrict. If we suppose a line to be drawn, from a few miles south\r\nof Aberdeen to a few miles south of Fort William, it will mark out\r\nthe central chain of the Grampians in its full extent, passing over\r\nthe most elevated ground, and by the heads of the largest rivers,\r\nin Scotland. Along this line there are many granite mountains, and\r\nlarge tracts in which granite is the prevailing rock. There are,\r\nhowever, large spaces also in which no granite appears, though, if we\r\nwere permitted to speak theoretically, and if the question did not\r\nentirely relate to a matter of observation, we might suppose, that,\r\nin no part of this central ridge is the granite far from the surface,\r\nnotwithstanding that in some places it may be covered by the schistus.\r\n\r\n313. A great part of the Grampian mountains is on the south side of the\r\nline just mentioned, but hardly any granite is found in this division\r\nof them, except such veins as those of Glentilt. On the north side of\r\nthe line, the granite extends in various directions; and, if from Fort\r\nWilliam a line is drawn to Inverness, the quadrilateral figure, bounded\r\non two sides by these lines, and on the other two by the sea, will be\r\nfound to contain much granite, and many districts consisting entirely\r\nof that stone. This is in fact the great granite country of Scotland:\r\nit is a large tract, containing about 3170 square geographical\r\nmiles, or about a seventh part of the whole: but the proportion of\r\nit occupied by granite cannot at present be ascertained with any\r\nexactness, nor will, till some mineralogist shall find leisure to\r\nexamine the courses of the great rivers, the Dee, the Spey, &c. which\r\ntraverse this country. If we call it one-fourth of the whole surface,\r\nits extent is certainly not underrated, and will amount to 790 square\r\nmiles nearly; to which adding 150, as a very full allowance for all the\r\nother granite contained in Scotland, exclusive of the isles, we shall\r\nhave 940 square miles, between a twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth part of\r\nthe surface of the whole.\r\n\r\nThis computation, it must be observed, aims at nothing precise, but I\r\nthink it is such, that a more accurate survey would rather diminish\r\nthan increase the proportion assigned in it to the granite rock.\r\n\r\n314. This result may perhaps fall as much short of Mr Kirwan's notion,\r\nas it exceeds the estimate made by Dr Hutton. If it shall not, and if\r\nthe former has, in this instance, come nearest the truth, it cannot\r\nbe ascribed to the accuracy of his information, or the soundness of\r\nthe principles which directed his research. Mr WILLIAMS, whom he\r\nquotes, was a miner, of great skill and experience in some branches\r\nof his profession, to which, if he had confined himself, he might\r\nhave written a book full of useful information. What he says on the\r\nsubject of granite, is, in the main I believe just; but it is far too\r\ngeneral to authorize the conclusion which Mr Kirwan derives from it.\r\nDr Ash, for whose judgment I have great respect, cannot, I think, have\r\nmeant, when he used the expression granitic rocks, to describe granite\r\nstrictly so called. He says, in the passage quoted by Mr Kirwan, that\r\n\"from Galloway, Dumfries, and Berwick, there is a chain of mountains,\r\ncommonly schistose, but often also granitic.\" Now, the fact is, that\r\nthe great belt of primary rock, here alluded to, which traverses the\r\nsouth of Scotland, consists of vertical schistus of various kinds;\r\nbut except in Galloway, and again in Lammermuir, near Priestlaw, it\r\nappears, as already mentioned, to contain no granite whatsoever. If the\r\nGerman mineralogist quoted by Mr Kirwan, when he says that the Grampian\r\nmountains consist of micaceous limestone, gneiss, porphyry, argillite,\r\nand granite, alternating with one another, means only to affirm that\r\nall these stones are found in the Grampians, he is certainly in the\r\nright, and the catalogue might easily be enlarged; but, if he either\r\nmeans to say, that these are nearly in equal abundance, or that the\r\ngranite is commonly found in strata alternating with other strata, I\r\nmust say, that these are propositions quite contrary to any thing\r\nI have ever seen or heard of those mountains. But it is probable\r\nthat this is not meant, and that the fault lies in understanding\r\nthe expressions much too literally. Mr Kirwan accuses Dr Hutton of\r\nnot knowing where to look for the granite; not aware of how much,\r\nnotwithstanding any error committed in the present estimate, he was\r\nskilled in the art of mineralogical observation; an art, which those\r\nwho have not practised do not always know how to appreciate. But,\r\nhowever imperfect Mr Kirwan's knowledge of this subject has been,\r\nhe has here had the good fortune to correct a mineralogist of very\r\nsuperior information. The mere disposition to oppose is not always\r\nwithout its use: no man is in every thing free from error, and, to\r\ncontrovert indiscriminately all the opinions of any individual, is an\r\ninfallible secret for being sometimes in the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XVI. § 100.\r\n\r\n                          _Rivers and Lakes._\r\n\r\n\r\n315. Rivers are the causes of waste most visible to us, and most\r\nobviously capable of producing great effects. It is not, however, in\r\nthe greatest rivers, that the power to change and wear the surface of\r\nthe land is most clearly seen. It is at the heads of rivers, and in the\r\nfeeders of the larger streams, where they descend over the most rapid\r\nslope, and are most subject to irregular or temporary increase and\r\ndiminution, that the causes which tend to preserve, and those that tend\r\nto change the form of the earth's surface, are farthest from balancing\r\none another, and where, after every season, almost after every flood,\r\nwe perceive some change produced, for which no compensation can be\r\nmade, and something removed which is never to be replaced. When we\r\ntrace up rivers and their branches toward their source, we come at\r\nlast to rivulets, that run only in time of rain, and that are dry, at\r\nother seasons. It is there, says Dr Hutton, that I would wish to carry\r\nmy reader, that he may be convinced, by his own observation, of this\r\ngreat; fact, _that the rivers have, in general, hollowed out their\r\nvalleys_. The changes of the valley of the main river are but slow;\r\nthe plain indeed is wasted in one place, but is repaired in another,\r\nand we do not perceive the place from whence the repairing matter has\r\nproceeded. That which the spectator sees here, does not therefore\r\nimmediately suggest to him what has been the state of things before\r\nthe valley was hollowed out. But it is otherwise in the valley of the\r\nrivulet; no person can examine it without seeing, that the rivulet\r\ncarries away matter which cannot be repaired, except by wearing away\r\nsome part of the surface of the place upon which the rain that forms\r\nthe stream is gathered. The remains of a former state are here visible;\r\nand we can, without any long chain of reasoning, compare what has been\r\nwith what is at the present moment. It requires but little study to\r\nreplace the parts removed, and to see nature at work, resolving the\r\nmost hard and solid masses, by the continued influences of the sun and\r\natmosphere.[161] We see the beginning of that long journey, by which\r\nheavy bodies travel from the summit of the land to the bottom of the\r\nocean, and we remain convinced, that, _on our continents, there is no\r\nspot on which a river may not formerly have run_.[162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Theory of the Earth, vol. ii. 294.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _Ibid._ p. 296.]\r\n\r\n316. The view thus afforded of the operations, in their nascent state,\r\nwhich have shaped out and fashioned the present surface of the land,\r\nis necessary to prepare us for following them to the utmost extent\r\nof their effects. From these effects, the truth of the proposition,\r\nthat rivers have cut and formed, not the beds only, but the whole of\r\nthe valleys, or rather system of valleys, through which they flow, is\r\ndemonstrated on a principle which has a close affinity to that on which\r\nchances are usually calculated, § 99. In order to conceive rightly the\r\ncourse of a great river, and the communication subsisting between the\r\nmain trunk and its remotest branches, let us take the instance of the\r\nDanube and cast our eyes on one of the maps constructed by MARSIGLI,\r\nfor illustrating the natural history of that great river.[163] When\r\nit is considered, that over all the vast and uneven surface, which\r\nreaches from the Alps to the Euxine, and from the mountains of Crapack\r\nto those of Hæmus, a regular communication is kept up between every\r\npoint and the line of greatest depression, in which the river flows, no\r\none can hesitate to acknowledge, that it is the agency of the waters\r\nalone which has opened them a free passage through all the intricacies\r\nof this amazing labyrinth. In effect, suppose this communication to be\r\ninterrupted, and that some sudden operation of nature were to erect a\r\nbarrier of mountains to oppose the Theise or the Drave, as they rolled\r\ntheir waters to the Danube. From this what could possibly result, but\r\nthe damming up of those rivers till their waters were deep, or high\r\nenough to find a vent, either under the bases or over the tops of the\r\nopposing ridge. Thus there would be formed immense lakes and immense\r\ncataracts, which, by filling up what was too low, and cutting down what\r\nwas too high, would in time restore such a uniform declivity of surface\r\nas had before prevailed. Just so in the times that are past, whatever\r\nmay have been the irregularities of the surface at its first emerging\r\nfrom the sea, or whatever irregularities may have been produced in\r\nit by subsequent convulsions, the slow action of the streams would\r\nnot fail in time to create or renew a system of valleys communicating\r\nwith one another, like that which we at present behold. Water, in all\r\ncircumstances, would find its way to the lowest point; though, where\r\nthe surface was quite irregular, it would not do so till after being\r\ndammed up in a thousand lakes, or dashed in cataracts over a thousand\r\nprecipices. Where neither of these is the case; and where the lake and\r\nthe cataract are comparatively rare phenomena; there we perceive that\r\nconstitution of a surface, which water alone, of all physical agents,\r\nhas a tendency to produce; and we must conclude, that the probability\r\nof such a constitution having arisen from another cause, is, to the\r\nprobability of its having arisen from the running of water, in such a\r\nproportion as unity bears to a number infinitely great.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Histoire du Danube, tom. i. tab. 34.]\r\n\r\n317. The courses of many rivers retain marks that they once consisted\r\nof a series of lakes, which have been converted into dry ground, by the\r\ntwofold operation of filling up the bottoms, and deepening the outlets.\r\nThis happens, especially, when successive terraces of gravelly and\r\nflat land are found on the banks of a river, § 100. Such platforms, or\r\n_haughs_ as they are called in this country, are always proofs of the\r\nwaste and _detritus_ produced by the river, and of the different levels\r\non which it has run; but they sometimes lead us farther, and make it\r\ncertain, that the great mass of gravel which forms the successive\r\nterraces on each side of the river, was deposited in the basin of a\r\nlake. If, from the level of the highest terrace, down to the present\r\nbed of the river, all is alluvial, and formed of sand and gravel, it\r\nis then evident, that the space as low as the river now runs must have\r\nbeen once occupied by water; at the same time, it is dear, that water\r\nmust have stood, or flowed as high at least, as the uppermost surface\r\nof the meadow. It is impossible to reconcile these two facts, which are\r\nboth undeniable, but by supposing a lake, or body of stagnant water,\r\nto have here occupied a great hollow, (which by us must be held as\r\none of the original inequalities of the globe, because we can trace\r\nit no farther back,) and that this hollow, in the course of ages, has\r\nbeen filled up by the gravel and alluvial earth brought down by the\r\nriver, which is now cutting its channel through materials of its own\r\ndepositing. There is no great river that does not afford instances\r\nof this, both in the hilly part of its course, and where it descends\r\nfirst from thence into the plain. Were there room here for the minuter\r\ndetails of topographical description, this might be illustrated by\r\ninnumerable examples.\r\n\r\n318. It is said above, that the water must have run or stood, in\r\nformer times, as low as the present bottom of the river; but there is\r\noften clear evidence, that it has run or stood much lower, because the\r\nalluvial land reaches far below the present level of the river. This is\r\nknown to hold in very many instances, where it has happened that pits\r\nhave been sunk to considerable depths on the banks of large rivers. By\r\nthat means, the depth of the alluvial ground, under the present bed of\r\nthe river, has been discovered to be great; and from this arises the\r\ndifficulty, so generally experienced, of finding good foundations for\r\nbridges that are built over rivers in large valleys, or open plains,\r\nthe ground being composed of travelled materials to an unknown depth,\r\nwithout any thing like the native or solid strata. In such cases, it\r\nis evident, that formerly the water must have been much lower, as well\r\nas much higher, than its present level, and this is only consistent\r\nwith the notion, that the place was once occupied by a deep lake.\r\n\r\n319. If, following the light derived from these indications, we go\r\nback to the time when the river ran above the highest of those levels\r\nat which it has left any traces of its operations, we shall see it\r\ncomposed of a series of lakes and cataracts, from which, by the\r\nfilling up of the one, and the wearing down of the other, the waters\r\nhave at length worked out to themselves a quiet and uninterrupted\r\npassage to the ocean. We may, indeed, on good evidence, go back still\r\nfarther than the succession of such meadows or terraces, as are above\r\nmentioned, will carry us, and may consider the whole valley, or\r\ntrough of the river, as produced by its own operations. The original\r\ninequalities of the surface, and the disposition of the strata, must\r\nno doubt have determined the water courses at first; but this does not\r\nhinder us from considering the rivers as having modified and changed\r\nthose inequalities, and as the proximate causes of the shape and\r\nconfiguration which the surface has now assumed.\r\n\r\n320. From this gradual change of lakes into rivers, it follows, that\r\na lake is but a temporary and accidental condition of a river, which\r\nis every day approaching to its termination; and the truth of this is\r\nattested, not only by the lakes that have existed, but also by those\r\nthat continue to exist. Where any considerable stream enters a lake,\r\na flat meadow is usually observed increasing from year to year. The\r\nsoil of this meadow is disposed in horizontal strata: the meadow is\r\nterminated by a marsh; which marsh is acquiring solidity, and is soon\r\nto be converted into a meadow, as the meadow will be into an arable\r\nfield. All this while the sediment of the river makes its way slowly\r\ninto the lake, forming a mound or bank under the surface of the water,\r\nwith a pretty rapid slope toward the lake. This mound increases by the\r\naddition of new earth, sand, and gravel, poured in over the slope; and\r\nthus the progress of filling up continually advances.\r\n\r\n321. In small lakes, this progress may easily be traced; and will be\r\nfound singularly conspicuous in that beautiful assemblage of lakes,\r\nwhich so highly adorns the mountain scenery of Westmoreland and\r\nCumberland. Among these a great number of instances appear, in which\r\nlakes are either partially filled up, or have entirely disappeared. In\r\nthe Lake of Keswick, we not only discover the marks of filling up at\r\nthe upper end, which extend far into Borrowdale, from which valley a\r\nsmall river flows into the lake; but we have the clearest proof, that\r\nthis lake was once united to that of Bassenthwaite, and occupied the\r\nwhole valley from Borrowdale to Ouse-Bridge. These two lakes are at\r\npresent joined only by a stream, which runs from the former into the\r\nlatter, and their continuity is interrupted by a considerable piece of\r\nalluvial land, composed of beds of earth and gravel, without rock, or\r\nany appearance of the native strata. This separation, therefore, seems\r\nno other than a _bar_, formed by the influx of two rivers, that enter\r\nthe valley here from opposite sides, the Greata from the east, and\r\nNewland's water from the west. The surface of this meadow is at present\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet at least above the level of either lake and a\r\nquantity of water of that depth must therefore have been drawn off by\r\nthe deepening of the issue at Ouse-Bridge, through which the water of\r\nboth lakes passes, in its way to the ocean.\r\n\r\nMany more examples, similar to this, may be collected from the same\r\nlakes; there are indeed few places from which, in this branch of\r\ngeology, more information may be collected.\r\n\r\n322. The larger lakes exemplify the same progress. Where the Rhone\r\nenters the Lake of Geneva, the beach has been observed to receive an\r\nannual increase; and the Portus Valesiæ, now Port Valais, which is at\r\npresent half a league from the lake, was formerly close upon its bank.\r\nIndeed, the sediments of the Rhone appear clearly to have formed the\r\nvalley through which it runs, to a distance of about three leagues at\r\nleast from the place where the river now discharges itself into the\r\nlake. The ground there is perfectly horizontal, composed of sand and\r\nmud, little raised above the level of the river, and full of marshes.\r\nThe deposition made by the Rhone after it enters the lake, is visible\r\nto the eye; and may be seen falling down in clouds to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe great lakes of North America are undergoing the same changes, and,\r\nit would seem, even with more rapidity. As the rivers, however, which\r\nsupply these vast reservoirs, are none of them very great, the filling\r\nup is much less remarkable than the draining off of the water, by the\r\ndeepening of the outlet. An intelligent traveller has remarked, that\r\nin Lake Superior itself the diminution of the waters is apparent,\r\nand that marks can be discovered on the rocks, of the surface having\r\nbeen six feet higher than it is at present. In the smaller lakes this\r\ndiminution is still more evident.[164] In some of those far inland, the\r\nground all round appeared to the same traveller to be the deposit from\r\nthe rivers, of which the lakes themselves may be considered as a mere\r\nexpansion.[165]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Mackenzie's Voyages through the Continent of North\r\nAmerica to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans, p. xlii. and xxxvi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: _Ibid._ p. 122.]\r\n\r\n323. In order to give uniform declivities to the rivers, the lakes\r\nmust not only be filled up or drained, but the cataract, wherever\r\nthere is one, must be worn away. The latter is an operation in all\r\ncases visible. The stream, as it precipitates itself over the rocks,\r\nhurries along with it, not only sand and gravel, but occasionally large\r\nstones, which grind and wear down the rock with a force proportioned\r\nto their magnitude and acceleration. The smooth surface of the rocks\r\nin all waterfalls, their rounded surface, and curious excavations,\r\nare the most satisfactory proofs of the constant attrition which they\r\nendure; and, where the rocks are deeply intersected, these marks\r\noften reach to a great height above the level on which the water now\r\nflows. The phenomena, in such instances, are among the arguments best\r\ncalculated to remove all incredulity respecting the waste which rivers\r\nhave produced, and are continuing to produce. They suffer no doubt to\r\nremain, that the height and asperity of every waterfall are continually\r\ndiminishing; that innumerable cataracts are entirely obliterated; that\r\nthose which remain are verging toward the same end, and that the Falls\r\nof Montmorenci and Niagara must ultimately disappear.\r\n\r\n324. Though there can be no doubt of the justness of the preceding\r\nconclusions, when applied to lakes in general, some apparent\r\nexceptions occur, in which the progress of draining and filling up\r\nseems to have been suspended, or even to have gone in a contrary\r\ndirection. These exceptions consist of the lakes which appear to\r\nhave received a greater quantity of materials than was sufficient to\r\nhave filled them up. Such, for example, is the Lake of Geneva, which\r\nreceives the Rhone descending from the Valais, one of the deepest and\r\nlongest valleys on the surface of the earth. Now, if this valley, or\r\neven a large proportion of it, had been excavated by the Rhone itself,\r\nas our theory leads us to suppose, the lake ought to have been entirely\r\nfilled up, because the materials brought down by the river seem to be\r\nmuch greater than the lake, on any reasonable supposition concerning\r\nits original magnitude, can possibly have received. What, then, it\r\nmay be said, has become of all that the Rhone has brought down and\r\ndeposited in it? The lake, at this moment, retains, in some places, the\r\ndepth of more than 1000 feet; and yet, of all that the Rhone carries\r\ninto it, nothing but the pure water issues. If it has been continuing\r\nto diminish, both in superficial extent and in depth, from the time\r\nwhen the Rhone began to run into it, what must have been its original\r\ndimensions?\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to remove entirely the difficulty which is here\r\nstated; yet I think the following remarks may go some length in doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\n325. It is certain, that from the present state of the Lake of Geneva,\r\nand of the ground round it, we can hardly draw any inference as to its\r\noriginal dimensions. Saussure has traced, with his usual skill, the\r\nmarks of the course of the Rhone, on a level greatly above the present;\r\nand, by observations on the side of Mont Saleve, has found proofs of\r\nthe running of water, at least 200 toises above the present superficies\r\nof the lake. But, if ever the superficies of the lake stood at this\r\nheight, or at this height nearly, though we can conjecture but little\r\nconcerning the state of the adjacent country, which no doubt was also\r\non a higher level, the lake may very well be supposed to have been of\r\nfar greater dimensions than it is now. It may have occupied the whole\r\nspace from Jura to Saleve, and included the Lake of Neufchâtel; so\r\nthat it may have been of magnitude sufficient to receive the spoils of\r\nthe Valais, which, as the surface of its waters lowered, may have been\r\nwashed away and carried down to the sea. Thus it may have afforded a\r\ntemporary receptacle for the _debris_ of the Alps, and may have served\r\nfor an _entrepot_, as it were, where those _debris_ were deposited,\r\nbefore they were carried to the place of their ultimate destination.\r\n\r\n326. But the great depth which the lake has at present, still remains\r\nto be explained, because no mud or gravel could be carried beyond the\r\ngulf, of a thousand feet deep, which was here ready to receive it. The\r\nreality of this difficulty must be acknowledged; and some cause seems\r\nto act, if not in the generation, yet certainly in the preservation of\r\nlakes, with which we are but little acquainted We can indeed imagine\r\nsome causes of that kind to occur in the course of the degradation\r\nof the land, which may produce new lakes, or increase the dimensions\r\nof the old. The wearing away of a stratum, or body of strata, may\r\nlay bare, and render accessible to the water, some beds of mineral\r\nsubstances soluble in that fluid. The district, for instance, in\r\nCheshire, which contains rock-salt, extends over a tract of fourteen or\r\nfifteen miles, and is covered by a thick stratum of clay, more or less\r\nindurated, which defends the salt from the water at the surface, and\r\npreserves the whole mass in a state of dryness. Should this covering be\r\nbroke open by any natural convulsion, or should it be worn away, as it\r\nmust be in the progress of the general detritus, the water would gain\r\nadmission to the saline strata, would gradually dissolve them, and\r\nform of course a very deep and extensive lake, where all was before dry\r\nland. This event is not only possible, but it should seem, that in the\r\ncourse of things it must necessarily happen.\r\n\r\n327. Something of this kind may have taken place in the track of the\r\nRhone, and may have produced the Leman Lake. It is not impossible,\r\nthat, at a very remote period, the Rhone descended from the Alps\r\nwithout forming any lake, or at least any lake of which the remains are\r\nnow existing; and this supposition, which is more probable than that of\r\n§ 325, we shall soon find to be conformable to appearances of another\r\nkind. The river may have wore away the secondary limestone strata over\r\nwhich it took its course after it left the schistus of the mountains;\r\nand, in doing so, may have reached some stratum of a saline nature, and\r\nthis being washed out, may have left behind it a lake, which is but\r\nmodern compared with many of the revolutions that have happened on the\r\nsurface of the earth.[166]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: There are salt springs at Bex, near Aigle, about ten\r\nmiles from the head of the lake: saline strata, therefore, are probably\r\nat no great distance.]\r\n\r\nThis explanation is no doubt hypothetical; but it is proposed in one\r\nof those cases, in which hypothetical reasonings are warranted by\r\nthe strictest rules of philosophical investigation. It is proposed\r\nin a case, where the causes visible to man seem inadequate to the\r\neffect, and where we must therefore have recourse to an agent that is\r\ninvisible. If the operations ascribed to this agent are conformable to\r\nthe analogy of nature, it is all that can in reason be required.\r\n\r\n328. Another circumstance may also influence the generation and\r\npreservation of lakes; but it is also one with which we are but little\r\nacquainted. The strata, and indeed the whole body of mineral substances\r\nwhich forms the basis of our land, have been raised up from the bottom\r\nof the sea, by a progress that should seem in general to have been\r\ngradual and slow. Appearances, however, are not wanting, which show,\r\nthat this progress is not uniform; and that both rising and sinking in\r\nthe surface of the land, or in the rocks which are the base of it, have\r\nhappened within a period of time, which is by no means of great extent.\r\nIn this progress, the elevations and depressions may not be the same\r\nfor every spot. They may be partial, and one part of a stratum, or body\r\nof strata, may rise to a greater height, or be more depressed, than\r\nanother. It is not impossible, that this process may affect the depth\r\nof lakes, and change the relative level of their sides and bottom.\r\n\r\n329. All lakes, however, do not involve the difficulty which the\r\npreceding conjectures are intended to remove. The great lakes of North\r\nAmerica do not, for instance, receive their supply from very large\r\nrivers. Of course, it is not from a tract great in comparison of\r\nthemselves, that the waste and detritus is brought down into them; and\r\nit seems not at all wonderful, that, without being filled up, they have\r\nbeen able to receive it. The same, in a degree at least, is true of\r\nmany other lakes.\r\n\r\nIt should also be considered, that we may err greatly in the estimate\r\nwe make of the materials actually carried down and deposited in any\r\nlake. To judge of their entire amount, we should know the original\r\nform of the inequalities on the earth's surface; of the quantity of\r\ndepression which existed, independently of the rivers; and though,\r\nin general, these original inequalities may be overlooked, and the\r\npresent considered as made by the running of water, yet, in particular\r\ninstances, this may be far from true. The Valais, for example, which\r\nwe consider as the work of the Rhone, may, when the Alps rose out of\r\nthe sea, have included many depressions of the surface, which the river\r\njoined together, and, from being a series of lakes, formed into one\r\ngreat valley.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n330. The mouths by which rivers on bold rocky coasts discharge their\r\nwaters into the sea, afford a very striking confirmation of the\r\nconclusions concerning the general system of waste and degradation\r\nwhich have been drawn above. At these mouths we usually see, not only\r\nthe bed of the river, but frequently a considerable valley, cut out\r\nof the solid rock, while that rock preserves its elevation, and its\r\nprecipitous aspect, wherever it is not intersected by a run of water.\r\nNo convulsion that can have torn asunder the rocks; no breach that can\r\nhave been made in them, antecedent to the running of the waters, will\r\naccount for the circumstance of every river finding a corresponding\r\nopening, by which it makes its way to the sea; for that opening being\r\nso nearly proportional to the magnitude of the river, and for such\r\nbreaches never occurring but where streams of water are found.\r\n\r\n331. The actual survey of any bold and rocky coast, will make this\r\nclearer than any general statement can possibly do. Let us take, for an\r\nexample, the coast of the British Channel, from Torbay to the Land's\r\nEnd, which is faced by a continued rampart of high cliffs, formed\r\nof much indurated and primeval rock. If we consider the breaches in\r\nthis rampart, at the mouths of the Dart, of the Plym and Tamer, of\r\nthe river at Fowey, of the Fal, the Hel, &c. it will appear perfectly\r\nclear, that they have been produced by their respective streams. Where\r\nthere is no stream, there is no breach in the rock, no softening in\r\nthe bold and stern aspect which this shore every where presents to the\r\nocean. If we look at the smaller streams, we find them working their\r\nway through the cliffs at the present moment; and we see the steps by\r\nwhich the larger valleys of the Dart and the Tamer have been cut down\r\nto the level of the sea. If we would have still clearer evidence, that\r\nno breaches made antecedently to the running of the rivers have opened\r\na way for them, we need only look to the opposite side, or northern\r\nshore, of the same promontory, where we also find a series of outlets,\r\nall originating in the ridge of the country, and becoming deeper as\r\nthey approach the sea, but altogether unconnected with the openings\r\non the south side; and this could hardly have been the case, had they\r\nbeen the effects of previous concussions, or of any peculiarity in the\r\noriginal structure of the rocks.\r\n\r\n332. In contemplating such coasts as these, when we go back to the\r\ntime when the rivers ran upon a level as high as the highest of the\r\ncliffs on the sea shore, we must suppose, that the land then extended\r\nmany miles farther into what is now occupied by the sea. When at\r\nPlymouth, for instance, the Tamer and the Plym flowed on the level of\r\nMount Edgecombe or of Staten Heights, if the rivers ran with a moderate\r\ndeclivity into the sea, the coast must have advanced many miles beyond\r\nits present line. Thus the land, when higher, was also more extended,\r\nand the limits of our island in that ancient state, were doubtless very\r\ndifferent from these by which it is at present circumscribed.\r\n\r\nIf with the same views we consider any other of the bold coasts which\r\nthe map of the world presents us with, we shall quickly remark, that\r\nwherever a deep intersection of the sea is made into the land, as on\r\nthe western shores of our own island, or on those of Norway, a river\r\nruns in at the head of it, and points out by what means such inlets\r\nare formed, viz. by the united powers of the sea and of the land, the\r\nwaters of the latter having opened the way by which those of the former\r\nhave penetrated so far into the country.\r\n\r\n333. It is not meant assuredly to deny the irregularities of the sea\r\ncoast, as it may have originally existed; these irregularities no doubt\r\ndetermined the initial operations of that waste and decay, by which, in\r\nprocess of time, they were themselves entirely effaced. The line of\r\nour coasts may be compared to one of those curves, which are sometimes\r\ntreated of in the higher geometry, where the ordinates are functions,\r\nnot only of, their abscissæ, but also of the time elapsed since a\r\ncertain epocha. The form of the curve at that epocha, or when the time\r\nbegan to flow, corresponds to the original form of the sea coast, on\r\nits emerging from the ocean, and before the powers of wasting and decay\r\nhad begun to act upon it. To speak strictly, the original figure, in\r\nboth cases, influences all the subsequent; but the farther removed from\r\nit in point of time, the less is that influence; so that, in physical\r\nquestions, and for the purpose of such approximations as suit the\r\nimperfection of our knowledge, the consideration of the original figure\r\nmay be wholly left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XVII. § 105.\r\n\r\n                    _Remains of Decomposed Rocks._\r\n\r\n\r\n334. THE plain of Crau was the _Campus Lapideus_ of the ancients; and,\r\nas mythology always seeks to connect itself with the extraordinary\r\nfacts in natural history, it was said to be the spot where Hercules,\r\nfighting with the sons of Neptune, and being in want of weapons, was\r\nsupplied from heaven by a shower of stones: hence it was called _Campus\r\nHerculeus_.\r\n\r\nThis plain is on the east side of the Rhone, between Salon and Aries:\r\nit is of a triangular form, about twenty square leagues in extent, and\r\nis covered almost entirely with quartzy gravel. This immense collection\r\nof gravel has been supposed by some to have been brought down by the\r\nDurance from the Alps of Dauphine; by others it has been ascribed to\r\nthe Rhone; and by many to the sea, as being a work too great for any\r\nriver. The explanation mentioned above, § 105, namely, that the loose\r\ngravel on the plain arises from the decomposition of a great stratum\r\nof pudding-stone, which is the basis of the whole, is the opinion of\r\nSaussure, and is founded on his own observations.[167]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: See Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1592 et 1597. See\r\nalso on this subject a Memoir by Lamanon, Journal de Physique, tom.\r\nxxii. p. 477; and another by M. De Servieres, _ibid._ p. 270.]\r\n\r\n335. The theories that have been contrived for explaining the\r\nphenomena of the plain of Crau, afford an instance of the necessity\r\nof generalizing our observations before we can explain a particular\r\nappearance: in other words, they prove the truth of Lord Bacon's\r\nmaxim, That the explanation of a phenomenon should not be sought for\r\nfrom the study of that phenomenon alone, but from the comparison of it\r\nwith others. One of the theories of this plain is, that the breccia,\r\nwhich is the base of it, is formed from the consolidation of the loose\r\ngravel of the plain, by water percolating through it, and carrying some\r\ncementing substance along with it, or some _lapidific juice_, as it\r\nis called. And indeed, whether the gravel is formed from the breccia,\r\nor the breccia from the gravel, is a question which probably could\r\nnever be resolved by the mere examination of the plain itself. But the\r\nquestion is very soon decided, when we compare what is observed here\r\nwith other appearances in the natural history of the earth's surface,\r\nand consider how much more frequent the decomposition of solids is,\r\nthan their reconsolidation, in any place above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n336. The argument for the decomposition of stony substances which is\r\nafforded by the state of this singular plain, may be confirmed by\r\nthe appearances observed in many extensive tracts of land all over\r\nthe world, and especially in some parts of Great Britain. The road\r\nto Exeter from Taunton Dean, between the latter and Honiton, passes\r\nover a large heath or down, considerably elevated above the plain of\r\nTaunton. The rock which is the base of this heath, as far as can be\r\ndiscovered, is limestone, and over the surface of it large flints, in\r\nthe form of gravel, are very thickly spread. There is no higher ground\r\nin the neighbourhood from which this gravel can be supposed to have\r\ncome, nor any stream that can have carried it, so that no explanation\r\nof it remains, but that it is formed of the flints contained in beds\r\nof limestone, which are now worn away. The flints on the heath are\r\nprecisely of the kind found in limestone; many of them are not much\r\nworn, and cannot have travelled far from the rock in which they were\r\noriginally contained. It seems certain, therefore, that they are the\r\n_debris_ of limestone strata, now entirely decomposed, that once lay\r\nabove the strata which at present form the base of this elevated plain,\r\nand probably covered them to a considerable height. This explanation\r\ncarries the greater probability with it, that any other way of\r\naccounting for the fact in question, as the travelling of the gravel\r\nfrom higher grounds, or the immersion of the surface under the sea,\r\nwill imply changes in the face of the country, incomparably greater\r\nthan are here supposed. Our hypothesis seems to give the _minimum_ of\r\nall the kinds of change that can possibly account for the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n337. The same remarks may be made on the high plain of Blackdown, which\r\nthe road passes over in going from Exeter to the westward. The flints\r\nthere are disseminated over the surface as thickly as in the other\r\ninstance, and can be explained only on the same supposition.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the interior of England, beginning from about Worcester\r\nand Birmingham, and proceeding north-east through Warwickshire,\r\nLeicestershire, Nottinghamshire, as far as the south of Yorkshire, a\r\nparticular species of highly indurated gravel, formed of granulated\r\nquartz, is found every where in great abundance. This same gravel\r\nextends to the west and north-west, as far as Ashburn in Derbyshire,\r\nand perhaps still farther to the north. The quantity of it about\r\nBirmingham is very remarkable, as well as in many other places; and the\r\nphenomenon is the more surprising, that no rock of the same sort is\r\nseen in its native place. It is such gravel as might be expected in a\r\nmountainous country, in Scotland, for instance, or in Switzerland, but\r\nnot at all in the fertile and secondary plains of England.\r\n\r\nThis enigma is explained, however, when it is observed, that the basis\r\nof the whole tract just described is a red sandstone, often containing\r\nin it a hard quartzy gravel, perfectly similar to that which has just\r\nbeen mentioned. From the dissolution of beds of this sandstone, which\r\nformerly covered the present, there can be no doubt that this gravel\r\nis derived. But, as the gravel is in general thinly dispersed through\r\nthe sandstone, and abounds only in some of its layers, it should\r\ntherefore seem, that a vast body of strata must have been worn away and\r\ndecomposed, before such quantities of gravel as now exist in the soil\r\ncould have been let loose.\r\n\r\n338. I have said, that a rock capable of affording such gravel as\r\nthis, is not to be found in the tract of country just mentioned.\r\nThis however, is not strictly true; for in Worcestershire, between\r\nBromesgrove and Birmingham, about seven miles from the latter, a rock\r\nis found consisting of indurated strata, greatly elevated, and without\r\ndoubt primitive, from the detritus of which such gravel as we are\r\nnow speaking of might be produced. These strata seem to rise up from\r\nunder the secondary, where they are intersected by the road; and, for\r\nas much as appears, are not of great thickness, so that they cannot\r\nhave afforded the materials of this gravel directly, though they may\r\nhave done so indirectly, or through the medium of the red sandstone;\r\nthat is to say, a primary rock of which they are the remains, may have\r\nafforded materials for the gravel in the sandstone; and this sandstone\r\nmay in its turn have afforded the materials of the present soil, and\r\nparticularly the gravel contained in it.\r\n\r\n339. Pudding-stones being very liable to decomposition, have probably,\r\nin most countries, afforded large proportion of the loose gravel now\r\nfound in the soil The mountains, or at least hills, of this rock, which\r\nare found in many places, prove the great extent of such decomposition.\r\nMount Rigi, for instance, on the side of the Lake of Lucerne, is\r\nentirely of pudding-stone, and is 742 toises in height, measured from\r\nthe level of the lake. By the descriptions given of it, as well as\r\nof other hills of the same kind in Switzerland, we may, without due\r\nattention, be led to suppose that they are entirely formed of loose\r\ngravel. Even M. Saussure's description is chargeable with this fault,\r\nthough, when attended to, it will be found to contain a sufficient\r\nproof, that this hill is composed of real pudding-stone.[168] The\r\nnature of the thing also, would be sufficient to convince us, that a\r\nhill, more than 4000 feet in height, could not consist of loose and\r\nunconsolidated materials.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we regard Mount Rigi as the remains of a body of\r\npudding-stone strata, we must conclude, that these strata were\r\noriginally more extensive, and the adjacent valleys and plains will\r\nserve, in some degree, to measure the quantity of them which time has\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1941.]\r\n\r\n340. If the theory of unstratified mountains, namely those of\r\nwhinstone, porphyry, and granite, be admitted as laid down above, it\r\nwill furnish a measure of the destruction which has taken place in the\r\nstratified rocks, and of the vast depredations which have been made\r\nupon them since they were raised up from the bottom of the sea. Like\r\nevery other measure, however, of wasting, by a thing that is itself\r\nsubject to waste, it can only give a _minimum_, or a limit which the\r\nquantity wasted must necessarily exceed.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt face of a whinstone rock must be understood as an evidence,\r\nthat some body of strata which supported it when fluid, remained\r\nin contact with it, when it was become solid; and if this part of\r\nthe mould in which the whinstone was cast, has disappeared, it must\r\ngenerally be ascribed to the operation of waste and decomposition.\r\nSuch a face, for instance, as that which Salisbury _Craig_ presents to\r\nthe west, viz. a perpendicular wall of whinstone, about ninety feet\r\nhigh, raised on a body of sandstone strata of the height of about\r\n300 feet, can have been produced only by having been abutted against\r\nsome stratified rock, equally abrupt, and of the same elevation with\r\nitself. Of this rock no part remains.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic rock of Edinburgh Castle is nearly in the same state. Its\r\nperpendicular sides on the south, west, and north, are now disengaged\r\nfrom the strata by which they were once encompassed.\r\n\r\n341. The granite mountains also, where they are quite unstratified,\r\ngive rise to the same conclusion. Those central chains which we find\r\nin so many instances towering above the schistus which cover their\r\nsides, have probably been once completely enveloped by the latter;\r\nand, on this supposition, an estimate may sometimes be formed of the\r\noriginal height of such mountains. In these estimations, however, some\r\nuncertainty must arise, from our being unable to distinguish between\r\nthe effects which are to be ascribed to the fracture and dislocation\r\nthat took place when the compound body of stratified and unstratified\r\nrocks was raised up from the bottom of the sea, and the effects\r\nproduced by the subsequent waste and decomposition at the surface. In\r\nthis, as in many other instances, we are not always able to separate\r\nbetween the original inequalities of the surface, and those which\r\nwearing has produced.\r\n\r\n342. It would be important to ascertain the rate at which the elevation\r\nof mountains decreases, and this is what we may perhaps expect to\r\nbe accomplished, by the progress of geological science, and the\r\nmultiplying of accurate observations. It has been supposed, that the\r\nPyrenees diminish about ten inches in a century; but what confidence is\r\nto be put in this estimate, I am unable to determine.[169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: Essai sur la Mineralogie des Pyrenées, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nA very unequivocal mark of the degradation of mountains is often to\r\nbe met with in the heaps of loose stones found on their tops. These\r\nstones, it is obvious, cannot have come from any other place by natural\r\nmeans, and they are accordingly always sharp and angular, and have none\r\nof the characters of transported rocks. They are said sometimes to\r\nhave been brought by men's hands; but this is highly improbable, their\r\nquantity is often so considerable, and the difficulty of transportation\r\nso great. Where any purpose was to be served by heaping them together,\r\nmen have availed themselves of the stones that they found ready\r\nprepared on the summit, and have constructed from them cairns, which\r\nhave served as signals, useful in their pastoral, and sometimes in\r\ntheir military occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NOTE XVIII. § 112.\r\n\r\n                    _Transportation of Stones, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n343. NATURE supplies the means of tracing with considerable certainty\r\nthe migration of fossil bodies on the surface of the earth, as only\r\nthe more indurated stones, and those most strongly characterized, can\r\nendure the accidents that must befal them in travelling to a distance\r\nfrom their native place.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact very generally observed, that where the valleys among\r\nprimitive mountains open into huge plains, the gravel of those plains\r\nconsists, of stones, evidently derived from the mountains. The nearer\r\nthat any spot is to the mountains, the larger are the gravel stones,\r\nand the less rounded is their figure; and, as the distance increases,\r\nthis gravel, which often forms a stratum nearly level, is covered\r\nwith a thicker bed of earth or vegetable soil. This progression has\r\nparticularly been observed in the valleys of Piémont and the plains of\r\nLombardy, where a bed of gravel forms the basis of the soil, from the\r\nfoot of the Alps to the shores of the Hadriatic.[170] We may collect\r\nfrom GUETTARD, that a similar gradation is found in the gravel and\r\nearth which cover the great plain of Poland, from Mount Krapack to the\r\nBaltic.[171] The reason of this gradation is evident; the farther the\r\nstones have travelled, and the more rubbing they have endured, the\r\nsmaller they grow, the more regular is the figure they assume, and the\r\ngreater the quantity of that finer detritus which constitutes the soil.\r\nThe washing of the rains and rivers is here obvious; and each of the\r\nthree quantities just mentioned, if not directly proportional to the\r\ndistance which the stones have migrated from their native place, may\r\nbe said, in the language of geometry, to be at least proportional to a\r\ncertain function of that distance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Mém. Acad. des Sciences, 1762, p. 234, 293, &c.]\r\n\r\n344. The immense quantity of _cailloux roulés_, or rounded gravel,\r\ncollected in the immediate vicinity of mountainous tracts, has led\r\nsome geologists to suppose the existence of ancient currents, which\r\ndescended from the mountains, in a quantity, and with a _momentum_,\r\nof which there is no example in the present state of the world. Thus\r\nSaussure imagines, that the hill of Supergue, near Turin, which is\r\nformed of gravel, can only be explained by supposing such currents as\r\nare just mentioned, or what he terms a _debacle_, to have taken place\r\nat some former period.[172] If, however, we ascribe to the mountains\r\na magnitude and elevation vastly greater than that which they now\r\npossess; if we regard the valleys between them as cut out by the rivers\r\nand torrents from an immense rampart of solid rock, neither materials\r\nsufficiently great, nor agents sufficiently powerful, will appear to\r\nbe wanting, for collecting bodies of gravel and other loose materials,\r\nequal to any that are found on the surface of the earth. The necessity\r\nof introducing a _debacle_, or any other unknown agent, to account for\r\nthe transportation of fossils, seems to arise from underrating the\r\neffects of action long continued, and not limited by such short periods\r\nas circumscribe the works, and even the observations, of men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iii. § 1303.]\r\n\r\n345. The supply of gravel and _cailloux roulés_, for the plains\r\nextended at the feet of primitive mountains, is doubtless in many cases\r\nmuch increased by the pudding-stone, interposed between the secondary\r\nand the primary strata. The beds of pudding-stone contain gravel\r\nalready formed on the shores of continents, that ceased to exist before\r\nthe present were produced; and the cement of this gravel, yielding\r\neasily to the weather, allows the stones included in it to be washed\r\ndown by the torrents, and scattered over the plains. I know not if\r\nthe hill of Supergue above mentioned, is not in reality a mass of the\r\npudding-stone which forms the border of the Alps, and of which the\r\nmaterials have suffered no transportation since the time of their last\r\nconsolidation. This at least is certain, that Saussure, notwithstanding\r\nhis accuracy, has sometimes confounded the loose gravel on the surface\r\nwith that which is consolidated into rock; an inaccuracy which is to be\r\ncharged, as I have elsewhere observed, rather against his system than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n346. The loose stones found on the sides of hills, and the bottoms\r\nof valleys, when traced back to their original place, point out with\r\ndemonstrative evidence the great changes which have happened since the\r\ncommencement of their journey; and in particular serve to show, that\r\nmany valleys which now deeply intersect the surface, had not begun to\r\nbe cut out when these stones were first detached from their native\r\nrocks. We know, for instance, that stones under the influence of such\r\nforces as we are now considering, cannot have first descended from one\r\nridge, and then ascended on the side of an opposite ridge. But the\r\ngranite of Mont Blanc has been found, as mentioned above, on the sides\r\nof Jura, and even on the side of it farthest from the Alps. Now, in\r\nthe present state of the earth's surface, between the central chain of\r\nthe Alps, from which these pieces of granite must have come, and the\r\nridge of Mont Jura, besides many smaller valleys, there is the great\r\nvalley of the Rhone, from the bottom of which, to the place where they\r\nnow lie, is a height of not less than 3000 feet. Stones could not, by\r\nany force that we know of, be made to ascend over this height. We must\r\ntherefore suppose, that when they travelled from Mont Blanc to Jura,\r\nthis deep valley did not exist, but that such an uniform declivity, as\r\nwater can run on with rapidity, extended from the one summit to the\r\nother. This supposition accords well with what has been already said\r\nconcerning the recent formation of the Leman Lake, and of the present\r\nvalley of the Rhone.\r\n\r\n347. We can derive, in a matter of this sort, but little and from\r\ncalculation; yet we may discover by it, whether our hypothesis\r\ntransgresses materially against the laws of probability, and is\r\ninconsistent with physical principles already established. The\r\nhorizontal distance from Mont Jura to the granite mountains, at the\r\nhead of the Arve, may be accounted fifty geographic miles. Though\r\nwe suppose Mont Blanc, and the rest of those mountains, to have been\r\noriginally much higher than they are at present, the ridge of Jura must\r\nhave been so likewise; and though probably not by an equal quantity,\r\nyet it is the fairest way to suppose the difference of their height to\r\nhave been nearly the same in former ages that it is at present, and\r\nit may therefore be taken at 10,000 feet. The declivity of a plane\r\nfrom the top of Mont Jura to the top of Mont Blanc, would therefore be\r\nabout one mile and three quarters in fifty, or one foot in thirty; an\r\ninclination much greater than is necessary for water to run on, even\r\nwith extreme rapidity, and more than sufficient to enable a river or\r\na torrent to carry with it stones or fragments of rock, almost to any\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nSaussure, in relating the fact that pieces of granite are found among\r\nthe high passes near the summits of Mont Jura, alleges, that they are\r\nonly found in spots from which the central chain of the Alps may be\r\nseen. But it should seem that this coincidence is accidental, because,\r\nfrom whatever cause the transportation of these blocks has proceeded,\r\nthe form of the mountains, especially of Mont Jura, must be too much\r\nchanged to admit of the supposition, that the places of it from which\r\nMont Blanc is now visible, are the same from which that mountain was\r\nvisible when these stones were transported hither. It may be, however,\r\nthat the passes which now exist in Mont Jura are the remains of valleys\r\nor beds of torrents, which once flowed westward from the Alps; and it\r\nis natural, that the fragments from the latter mountains should be\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of those ancient water-tracks.\r\n\r\n348. Saussure observed in another part of the Alps, that where the\r\nDrance descends from the sides of Mont Velan and the Great St Bernard,\r\nto join the Rhone in the Valais, the valley it runs in lies between\r\nmountains of primary schistus, in which no granite appears, and yet\r\nthat the bottom of this valley, toward its lower extremity, is for\r\na considerable way covered with loose blocks of granite.[173] His\r\nfamiliar acquaintance with all the rocks of those mountains, led him\r\nimmediately to suspect, that these stones came from the granite chain\r\nof Mont Blanc, which is westward of the Drance, and considerably higher\r\nthan the intervening mountains. This conjecture was verified by the\r\nobservations of one of his friends, who found the stones in question to\r\nagree exactly with a rock at the point of Ornes, the nearest part of\r\nthe granite chain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. ii. § 1022.]\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the surface, however, the valley of Orsiere\r\nlies between the rocks of Ornex and the valley of the Drance, and would\r\ncertainly have intercepted the granite blocks in their way from the one\r\nof these points to the other, if it had existed at the time when they\r\nwere passing over that tract. The valley of Orsiere, therefore, was not\r\nformed, when the torrents, or the glaciers transported these fragments\r\nfrom their native place.\r\n\r\nMountainous countries, when carefully examined, afford so many facts\r\nsimilar to the preceding, that we should never have done were we\r\nto enumerate all the instances in which they occur. They lead to\r\nconclusions of great use, if we would compare the machinery which\r\nnature actually employs in the transportation of rocks, with the\r\nlargest fragments of rock which appear to have been removed, at some\r\nformer period, from their native place.\r\n\r\n349. For the moving of large masses of rock, the most powerful engines\r\nwithout doubt which nature employs are the glaciers, those lakes or\r\nrivers of ice which are formed in the highest valleys of the Alps,\r\nand other mountains of the first order. These great masses are in\r\nperpetual motion, undermined by the influx of heat from the earth, and\r\nimpelled down the declivities on which they rest by their own enormous\r\nweight, together with that of the innumerable fragments of rock with\r\nwhich they are loaded. These fragments they gradually transport to\r\ntheir utmost boundaries, where a formidable wall ascertains the\r\nmagnitude, and attests the force, of the great engine by which it was\r\nerected. The immense quantity and size of the rocks thus transported,\r\nhave been remarked with astonishment by every observer,[174] and\r\nexplain sufficiently how fragments of rock may be put in motion, even\r\nwhere there is but little declivity, and where the actual surface of\r\nthe ground is considerably uneven. In this manner, before the valleys\r\nwere cut out in the form they now are, and when the mountains were\r\nstill more elevated, huge fragments of rock may have been carried to a\r\ngreat distance; and it is not wonderful, if these same masses, greatly\r\ndiminished in size, and reduced to gravel or sand, have reached the\r\nshores, or even the bottom, of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: The stones collected on the _Glacier de Miage_, when\r\nSaussure visited it, were in such quantity as to conceal the ice\r\nentirely. Voyages aux Alpes, tom. ii. § 854.]\r\n\r\n350. Next in force to the glaciers, the torrents are the most powerful\r\ninstruments employed in the transportation of stones. These, when\r\nthey descend from the sides of mountains, and even where the declivity\r\nof their course is not very great, produce effects which nothing but\r\ndirect experience could render credible. The fragments of rock which\r\noppose the torrent, are rendered specifically lighter by the fluid\r\nin which they are immersed, and lose by that means at least a third\r\npart of their weight: they are, at the same time, impelled by a force\r\nproportional to the square of the velocity with which the water rushes\r\nagainst them, and proportional also to the quantity of gravel and\r\nstones which it has already put in motion. Perhaps, after taking all\r\nthese circumstances into computation, in the midst of a scene perfectly\r\nquiet and undisturbed, a philosopher might remain in doubt as to the\r\npower of torrents to move the enormous bodies of rock which are seen\r\nin the bottom of the narrow valleys or deep glens of a mountainous\r\ncountry; but his incredulity, says an experienced traveller, will\r\ncease altogether, if he has been surprised by a storm in the midst of\r\nsome Alpine region; if he has seen the number and impetuosity of the\r\ncataracts which rushed down the sides of the mountains, and beheld the\r\nruin which accompanied them; and if, when the tempest was passed, he\r\nhas viewed those meadows, which a few hours before were covered with\r\nverdure, now buried under heaps of stones, or overwhelmed by masses of\r\nliquid mud, and the sides of the mountains cut by deep ravines, where\r\nthe track of the smallest rivulet was not before to be discovered.[175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: See an account of a thunder storm near Bareges, in the\r\nEssai sur la Mineralogie des Pyrenées, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nIt is but rarely, however, even on occasions like these, that such\r\nvast masses of rock can be seen actually in motion, as are often found\r\non the surface, apparently removed to a great distance from their\r\nnative place. The magnitude of these is so great, in many instances,\r\nthat their transportation cannot be explained without supposing,\r\nthat the surface was very different when these transportations took\r\nplace from what it is at present; that the elevation of the mountains\r\nwas greater, and the ground smoother and more uniform, at least in\r\nsome directions. If these suppositions are admitted, and they are\r\ncountenanced, as we have already seen, by almost every phenomenon in\r\ngeology, the difficulties which present themselves here will not appear\r\ninsurmountable.\r\n\r\n351. One of the largest blocks of granite that we know of, is on\r\nthe east side of the lake of Geneva, called _Pierre de Gouté_,\r\nabout ten feet in height, with a horizontal section of fifteen by\r\ntwenty.[176] Another block not far from it, and nearly of the same\r\nsize, has some remains of schistus attached to it. These stones very\r\nmuch resemble those which have fallen from the _Aiguilles_, in the\r\nvalley of Chamouni. The distance from their present situation to those\r\n_Aiguilles_ is about thirty English miles, with many mountains and\r\nvalleys at present interposed. By whatever means, therefore, these\r\nblocks were transported, their motion must have been over a surface\r\nof much more uniform declivity than the present. If the surface was\r\nwithout great inequalities, and its general declivity about one foot\r\nin thirty, as already computed, the glaciers, in the first place, and\r\nthe torrents afterwards, may have served for the transportation even of\r\nthese rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. i. § 308.]\r\n\r\n352. Again, in the narrow vale or glen which separates the Great from\r\nthe Little Saleve, the strata are all calcareous, but a great number\r\nof loose blocks of granite and primary schistus are scattered over the\r\nsurface. A block of the former, near the lower end of the valley, is\r\nabout the size of 1200 cubic feet. Two other large blocks of the same\r\nkind of stone rest on a base of horizontal limestone, elevated two\r\nor three feet above the rest of the surface. This elevation arises\r\nno doubt from the protection which the stones have afforded to the\r\ncalcareous beds on which they lie, so that these beds do not wear away\r\nso fast as those which are fully exposed to the weather. But it is\r\nsurely to take a very limited view of the operations on the surface,\r\nto suppose, with Saussure, that the parts of the calcareous rock under\r\nthese stones has suffered no waste whatsoever, so that the stones\r\nremain now in the identical spot where they were placed by the great\r\n_debacle_ which brought them down from the high Alps.[177] For my part,\r\nI have no doubt that the Arve, which is still at no great distance,\r\nwhen it ran on a higher level, and in a line different from the\r\npresent, aided by the glaciers and superior elevation of the mountains,\r\nwas an engine sufficiently powerful for effecting the transportation of\r\nthese stones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _Ibid._ § 227.]\r\n\r\n353. These phenomena are not peculiar to the Alps, but prevail, in\r\na greater or less degree, in the vicinity of all primary or granite\r\nmountains. In the island of Arran, a fragment of the same kind with\r\nthat which constitutes the upper part of Goatfield, is found on the sea\r\nshore, at least three miles from the nearest granite rock, and with a\r\nbay of the sea intervening. Its dimensions are not far from those of\r\nthe _pierre de gouté_. In some former state of the granitic mountains\r\nin that island, the declivity from the top of Goatfield may have been\r\nvery uniform, and more rapid than it is at present.\r\n\r\n354. Besides glaciers and torrents, which have no doubt been the\r\nprincipal instruments in producing these changes, other causes\r\nmay have occasionally operated. Large stones, when once detached,\r\nand resting on an inclined plane, from the effects of waste and\r\ndecomposition, may advance horizontally, at the same time that they\r\ndescend perpendicularly, and this will happen though they be not urged\r\nby any torrent, or any thing but their own weight; for the surface\r\nof the ground, as it wastes, remains higher under the stone, and for\r\na little way round it, than at a greater distance, on account of the\r\nprotection which it receives from the stone, as in the instances at\r\nSaleve, just mentioned. The stone itself also becomes rounded at the\r\nbottom; and thus the surface in contact with the ground is diminished\r\nin extent, and the two surfaces rendered convex towards one another. It\r\nmust therefore happen, that the support, continually weakening, will at\r\nlength give way, and the stone incline or roll toward the lower side,\r\nand may even roll considerably, if its centre of gravity has been high\r\nabove its point of support, and if its surface has had much convexity:\r\nThus the horizontal may very far exceed the perpendicular motion;\r\nand, in the course of ages, the stone may travel to a great distance.\r\nA stone, however, which travels in this manner, must diminish as it\r\nproceeds, and must have been much greater in the beginning than it is\r\nat present.\r\n\r\n355. This kind of motion may be aided by particular circumstances.\r\nWhen a stone rests on an inclined plane, so as to be in a state\r\nnot very remote from equilibrium, if a part be taken away from the\r\nupper side, the equilibrium will be lost, and the stone will thereby\r\nbe put in motion. That stones which lie on other stones, may, by\r\nwearing, be brought very near an equilibrium, is proved by what are\r\ncalled _rocking-stones_, or in Cornwall _Logan stones_, which have\r\nsometimes been mistaken for works of art; but are certainly nothing\r\nelse than stones, which have been subjected to the universal law\r\nof wasting and decay, in such peculiar circumstances, as nearly to\r\nbring about an equilibrium of that stable kind, which, when slightly\r\ndisturbed, re-establishes itself.[178] The Logan stone at the Land's\r\nEnd, is a mass of granite, weighing more than sixty tons, resting\r\non a rock of granite, of considerable height, and close on the sea\r\nshore. The two stones touch but in a small spot, their surfaces being\r\nconsiderably convex towards one another. The uppermost is so nearly\r\nin an equilibrium, that it can be made to vibrate by the strength\r\nof a man, though to overset it entirely would require a vast force.\r\nThis arises from the centre of gravity of the stone being somewhat\r\nlower than the centre of curvature of that part of it on which it\r\nhas a tendency to roll; the consequence of which is, that any motion\r\nimpressed on the stone, forces its centre of gravity to rise, (though\r\nnot very considerably,) by which means it returns whenever the force\r\nis removed, and vibrates backward and forward, till it is reduced to\r\nrest. Were it required to remove the stone from its place, it might be\r\nmost easily done, by cutting off a part from one side, or blowing it\r\naway by gunpowder; the stone would then lose its balance, would tumble\r\nfrom its pedestal, and might roll to a considerable distance. Now, what\r\nart is here supposed to perform, nature herself in time will probably\r\neffect. If the waste on one side of this great mass shall exceed that\r\non the opposite in more than a certain proportion, and it is not likely\r\nthat that proportion will be always maintained, the equilibrium of the\r\nLogan stone will be subverted, never to return. Thus we perceive how\r\nmotion may be produced by the combined action of the decomposition and\r\ngravitation of large masses of rock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: I do not presume so far as to say, that all\r\nrocking-stones are produced by natural means: I have not sufficient\r\ninformation to justify that assertion; but the great size of that\r\nat the Land's End, its elevated position, and the approaches toward\r\nsomething of the same kind which are to be seen in other parts of that\r\nshore, prove that it is no work of art. They who ascribe it to the\r\nDruids, do not consider the rapidity with which the Cornish granite\r\nwastes, nor think how improbable it is, that the conditions necessary\r\nto a rocking-stone, whether produced by nature or art, should have\r\nremained the same for sixteen or seventeen hundred years.]\r\n\r\n356. Besides the gradual waste to which stones exposed to the\r\natmosphere are necessarily subject, those of a great size appear to be\r\nliable to splitting, and dividing into large portions, no doubt from\r\ntheir weight. This may be observed in almost all stones that happen to\r\nbe in such circumstances as we are now considering; and from this cause\r\nthe subversion of their balance may be more sudden, and of greater\r\namount, than could be expected from their gradual decay.\r\n\r\nThus, if to the wasting of a stone at the bottom, we add the accidents\r\nthat may befal it in the wasting of its sides, we see at least the\r\nphysical possibility of detached stones being put in motion, merely\r\nby their own weight. It is indeed remarkable, that some of the largest\r\nof these stones rest on very narrow bases. Those at the foot of\r\nSaleve touch the ground only in a few points: The Boulder stone of\r\nBorrowdale is supported on a narrow ridge like the keel of a ship, and\r\nis prevented from tumbling by a stone or two, that serve as a kind of\r\nshores to prop it up. Very unexpected accidents sometimes happen to\r\ndisturb the rest of such fragments of rock as have once migrated from\r\ntheir own place. Saussure mentions a great mass of _lapis ollaris_[179]\r\nthat lies detached on the side of a declivity in the valley of Urseren,\r\nin the canton of Uri. The people use this stone as a quarry, and are\r\nworking it away on the upper side, in consequence of which it will\r\nprobably be soon overset, and will roll to the bottom of the valley.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Voyages aux Alpes, tom. iv. § 1851.]\r\n\r\n357. In many instances it cannot be doubted, that stones of the kind\r\nhere referred to are the remains of masses or veins of whinstone or\r\ngranite, now worn away, and that they have travelled but a very short\r\nway, or perhaps not at all, from their original place. Many of the\r\nlarge blocks of whinstone which we find in this country, sometimes\r\nsingle, and sometimes scattered in considerable abundance over a\r\nparticular spot, are certainly to be referred to this cause. But the\r\nmost remarkable examples of this sort are the stones found at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, on the hill called _Paarlberg_, which takes its name from\r\na chain of large round stones, like the pearls of a necklace, that\r\npasses over the summit. Two of these, placed near the highest point,\r\nare called the Pearl and the Diamond, and were mentioned several years\r\nago in the Philosophical Transactions.[180] From a more recent account,\r\nthese stones appear to be a species of granite, though the hill on\r\nwhich they lie is composed of sandstone strata.[181] The Pearl is a\r\nnaked rock, that rises to the height of 400 feet above the summit of\r\nthe hill; the Diamond is higher, but its base is less, and it is more\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: Vol. lxviii. p. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Barrow's Travels into Southern Africa, p. 60.]\r\n\r\nFrom the above stones forming a regular chain, as well as from the\r\nimmense size of the two largest, it is impossible to suppose that they\r\nhave been moved; and it is infinitely more probable, that they are\r\nparts of a granite vein, which runs across the sandstone strata, and\r\nof which some parts have resisted the action of the weather, while the\r\nrest have yielded to it. The whole geological history of this part of\r\nAfrica seems highly interesting, since, as far as can be collected from\r\nthe accounts of the ingenious traveller just mentioned, it consists\r\nof horizontal beds of sandstone or limestone, resting immediately on\r\ngranite, or on primary schistus. Loose blocks of granite are seen in\r\ngreat abundance at the foot of the Table Mountain, and along the sea\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n358. The system which accounts for such phenomena as have been\r\nconsidered in this and some of the preceding notes, by the operation\r\nof a great deluge, or _debacle_, as it is called, has been already\r\nmentioned. In Dr Hutton's theory, nothing whatever is ascribed to such\r\naccidental and unknown causes; and, though their existence is not\r\nabsolutely denied, their effects, whatever they may have been, are\r\nalleged to be entirely obliterated, so that they can be referred to\r\nno other class but that of mere possibilities. A minute discussion,\r\nhowever, of the question, Whether there are, on the surface of the\r\nearth, any effects that require the interposition of an extraordinary\r\ncause, would lead into a longer digression than is suited to this\r\nplace. I shall briefly state what appear to be the principal\r\nobjections to all such explanations of the phenomena of geology.\r\n\r\n359. The general structure of valleys among mountains, is highly\r\nunfavourable to the notion that they were produced by any single great\r\ntorrent, which swept over the surface of the earth. In some instances,\r\nvalleys diverge, as it were from a centre, in all directions. In\r\nothers, they originate from a ridge, and proceed with equal depth and\r\nextent on both sides of it, plainly indicating, that the force which\r\nproduced them was _nothing_, or evanescent at the summit of that ridge,\r\nand increased on both sides, as the distance from the ridge increased.\r\nThe working of water collected from the rains and the snows, and\r\nseeking its way from a higher to a lower level, is the only cause we\r\nknow of, which is subject to this law.\r\n\r\n360. Again, if we consider a valley as a space, which perhaps with many\r\nwindings and irregularities, has been hollowed out of the solid rock,\r\nit is plain, that no force of water, suddenly applied, could loosen\r\nand remove the great mass of stone which has actually disappeared.\r\nThe greatest column of water that could be brought to act against\r\nsuch a mass, whatever be the velocity we ascribe to it, could not\r\nbreak asunder and displace beds of rock many leagues in length, and\r\nin continuity with the rock on either side of them. The slow working\r\nof water, on the other hand, or the powers that we see every day in\r\naction, are quite sufficient for this effect, if time only is allowed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n361. Some valleys are so particularly constructed, as to carry with\r\nthem a still stronger refutation of the existence of a _debacle_. These\r\nare the longitudinal valleys, which have the openings by which the\r\nwater is discharged, not at one extremity, but at the broadside Such is\r\nthat on the east side of Mont Blanc, deeply excavated on the confines\r\nof the granite and schistus rock, and extending parallel to the beds of\r\nthe latter, from the Col de la Segne to the Col de Ferret; its opening\r\nis nearly in the middle, from which the Dora issues, and takes its\r\ncourse through a great valley, nearly at right angles to the chain of\r\nthe Alps, and to the valley just mentioned. From the structure of these\r\nvalleys, Saussure has argued very justly against Buffon's hypothesis,\r\nconcerning the formation of valleys by currents at the bottom of the\r\nsea.[182] It affords indeed a complete refutation of that hypothesis:\r\nand it affords one no less complete of the system which Saussure\r\nhimself seems on some occasions so much inclined to support. For if it\r\nbe said, that this valley was cut out by the current of a _debacle_,\r\nthat current must either have run in the direction of the valley of\r\nFerret, or in that of the Dora, which issues from it. If it had the\r\ndirection of the first, it could not cut out the second; and if it had\r\nthe direction of the second, it could not cut out the first. Besides,\r\nthe force which excavated this valley must have been _nothing_ at the\r\ntwo extreme points, viz. at the Col de la Segne and the Col de Ferret,\r\nand must have increased with the distance from each. It can have been\r\nproduced, therefore, only by the running of two streams in opposite\r\ndirections, on a surface that was but slightly uneven, these streams at\r\nmeeting taking a new direction, nearly at right angles to the former. A\r\nclearer proof could hardly be required than is afforded in this case,\r\nthat what is now a deep valley was formerly solid rock, which the\r\nrunning of the waters has gradually worn away; and that the waters,\r\nwhen they began to run, were on a level as high, at least, as the tops\r\nof those mountains by which the valley is bounded toward the lower side.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Voyage aux Alpes, tom. ii. § 920.]\r\n\r\n362. Longitudinal valleys, with the water bursting out transversely\r\nfrom their sides, like the preceding, are by no means confined to\r\nmountains of the first order. We have a very good example, though\r\non a small scale, of a valley of this sort, within a few miles of\r\nEdinburgh. The Pentland Hills form a double ridge, separated by a\r\nsmall longitudinal valley, that runs from N. E. to S. W., the water of\r\nwhich issues from an opening almost in the middle, and directed towards\r\nthe south. This, therefore, is not the work of any great torrent, which\r\noverwhelmed the country; for no one direction, which it is possible\r\nto assign to such a torrent, will afford an explanation, both of the\r\nvalley and its outlet.[183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: In Scotland there is one valley, of a kind that I\r\nbelieve is extremely rare in any part of the world, in accounting for\r\nwhich, the hypothesis of a torrent or _debacle_ might, if any where,\r\nbe employed to advantage. This is the valley which extends across the\r\nisland, from Inverness to Fort William, or from sea to sea, being open\r\nat both ends, and very little elevated in the middle. It is nearly\r\nstraight, and of a very uniform breadth, except that towards each end\r\nit widens considerably. The bottom, reckoning transversely, is flat,\r\nwithout any gradual slope from the sides towards the middle. From the\r\nsides the mountains rise immediately, and form two continued ridges\r\nof great height, like ramparts or embankments on each side of a large\r\nfossé. A great part of the bottom of this singular valley is occupied\r\nby lakes, namely, Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy. Its length is\r\nabout sixty-two miles, and the point of partition from which the waters\r\nrun different ways, viz. north-east to the German Ocean, and south-west\r\nto the Atlantic, is between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy; and, by the\r\nestimation of the eye, I should hardly think that it is elevated more\r\nthan ten or fifteen feet above the surface of either lake. The country\r\non both sides is rugged and mountainous, and the streams which descend\r\nfrom thence into the valley, either fall directly into the lakes, or\r\nturn off almost at right angles when they enter the valley. Though\r\nthe bottom of this valley, therefore, is every where alluvial, with\r\nthe exception, perhaps, of a few rocks which appear at the surface,\r\nit is certainly not excavated by the rivers which now flow in it. The\r\ndirection of the valley, it is to be observed, is the same with that of\r\nthe vertical strata which compose the mountain on either side.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a valley, not cut out by the working of any streams\r\nwhich now appear; and we may therefore make trial of the hypothesis\r\nof a _debacle_. This, however, will afford us no assistance; because,\r\nif we suppose what is now hollow to have been once occupied by the\r\nsame kind of rock which is on either side, no force of torrents can\r\nhave suddenly loosened and removed from its place a body of such vast\r\nmagnitude. A greater column of water, than one having for its base a\r\ntransverse section of the valley, could not act against it, and this\r\nwould have to overcome the cohesion and inertia of a column of rock\r\nof the same section, and of the length of sixty-two miles. It is not\r\nhazarding much to affirm, that no velocity which could be communicated\r\nto water, not even that which it could acquire by falling from an\r\ninfinite height, could give to it a force in any degree adequate to\r\nthis great effect.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this valley, which appears to me the most probable,\r\nis the following. It will be shown hereafter, that there is good reason\r\nto suppose, that, in most parts of our island, the relative level of\r\nthe sea and land has been in past ages considerably higher than it is\r\nat present. In such circumstances, this valley may have been under\r\nthe surface of the sea, the highest part of it being scarcely 100\r\nfeet above that level at present. It may have been a kind of sound,\r\ntherefore, or strait, which connected the German Sea with the Atlantic;\r\nand the strong currents, which, on account of the different times\r\nof high water in these two seas, must have run alternately up and\r\ndown this strait, may have produced that flatness of the bottom, and\r\nstraightness of the sides, and that widening at the extremities, which\r\nare mentioned above. In this way, too, some difficulties are removed\r\nrelative to Loch Ness, which is so deep as hardly to be consistent with\r\nthe indefinite length of the period of waste that must be ascribed to\r\nthe mountains on each side of it. Its depth is said, where greatest,\r\nnot to be less than 180 fathoms. According to this hypothesis, it may,\r\nat no very distant period, have been a part of the bottom of the sea.]\r\n\r\n363. They who maintain the existence of the _debacle_, will no doubt\r\nallege, that though these valleys were not cut out by means of it, yet\r\nothers may. But it must be recollected, that if some of the greatest\r\nand deepest valleys on the face of the earth, such as that just\r\nmentioned, on the east side of Mont Blanc, are thus shown to be the\r\nwork of the daily wasting of the surface, what other inequalities can\r\nbe great enough to require the interposition of a more powerful cause?\r\nIf a _dignus vindice nodus_ does not exist here, in what part of the\r\nnatural history of the earth is it likely to be found?\r\n\r\n364. The large masses of rock so often met with at a distance from\r\ntheir original place, are one of the arguments used for the _debacle_.\r\nIt has, however, been shown, that, supposing a form of the earth's\r\nsurface considerably different from the present, especially, supposing\r\nthe absence of the valleys which the rivers have gradually cut out, the\r\ntransportation of such stones is not impossible, even by such powers\r\nas nature employs at present. Now, without the supposition that the\r\nsurface was more continuous, and that its present inequalities did not\r\nexist, no force of torrents, whatever their velocity and magnitude may\r\nhave been, could have produced this transportation. No force of water\r\ncould raise a stone like the _pierre de goutté_ from the bottom of\r\na valley, to the top of a steep hail. Indeed, if we suppose a great\r\nfragment of rock to be hurried along on a horizontal or an inclined\r\nplane, by the force of water, the moment it comes to a deep valley, and\r\nhas to rise up over an ascent of a certain steepness, it will remain\r\nat rest; the water itself will lose its velocity, and the heavy bodies\r\nwhich it carried with it will proceed no farther. Thus, therefore, we\r\nhave the following dilemma. If the surface is not supposed to have\r\nhad a certain degree of uniformity in past times, a _debacle_ is\r\ninsufficient for the transportation of stones: If it is supposed to\r\nhave had that uniformity, a _debacle_ is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n365. Another fact, which has been supposed favourable to the opinion\r\nof the action of great torrents at some former period, is, that in\r\ncountries like that round Edinburgh, where whinstone hills rise up from\r\namong secondary strata, a remarkable uniformity is observed in the\r\ndirection of their abrupt faces. Thus, in the country just mentioned,\r\nthe steep faces generally front the west, whiles in the opposite\r\ndirection, the slope is gentle, and the hills decline gradually into\r\nthe plain. Hence it is supposed, that a torrent, sweeping from west to\r\neast, has carried off the strata from the west side of these hills,\r\nbut, being obstructed by the whinstone rock, has left the strata on\r\nthe east side in their natural place.\r\n\r\nBut, besides that no force which can ever be ascribed to a torrent\r\ncould have removed at once bodies of strata 300 or 400 feet, nay even\r\n800 or 1000 in thickness, which must have been the case if this were\r\nthe true explanation of the fact, there is a circumstance which may\r\nperhaps enable us to explain these phenomena without the assistance of\r\nany extraordinary cause. The secondary strata in which the whinstone\r\nhills are found in this part of Scotland, are not horizontal, but\r\nrise or _head_ towards the west, dipping towards the east. The side,\r\ntherefore, of the whinstone hills which is precipitous, is the same\r\nwith that towards which the strata rise. Now, from the manner in which\r\nthese hills are supposed to have been elevated, the strata are likely\r\nto have been most broken and shattered towards that side, while, on the\r\nopposite, they had the support of the whinstone rock. They would become\r\na prey, therefore, more easily to the common causes of erosion and\r\nwaste on the upper side than on the lower. The streams that flowed from\r\nthe higher grounds would wear them on the former most readily; and the\r\naction of these streams would be resisted by the superior hardness of\r\nthe whinstone, just as the great torrent of the _debacle_ is supposed\r\nto have been.\r\n\r\nIt should also be observed, that this fact of the uniform direction of\r\nthe abrupt faces of mountains, is often too hastily generalized. In\r\nprimitive countries, it is no farther observed than by the steep faces\r\nof the mountains being most frequently turned toward the central chain.\r\nIn Scotland, as soon as you leave the flat country, and enter the\r\nHighlands, the scarps of the hills face indiscriminately all the points\r\nof the compass, and are directed as often to the east as to the west.\r\n\r\n366. Where the strata are nearly horizontal, they afford the most\r\ndistinct information concerning the direction and progress of the\r\nwasting of the land. The inclined position of the strata, which in all\r\nother cases must enter for so much into our estimate of the causes\r\nwhich have produced the present inequality of the earth's surface,\r\ndisappears there entirely; and the whole of that inequality is to be\r\nascribed to the operations at the surface, whether they have been\r\nsudden or gradual. A very important fact from a country of this\r\nsort, is related by BARROW, in his Travels into Southern Africa. The\r\nmountains about the Cape of Good Hope, and as far to the north as that\r\ningenious traveller prosecuted his journey, are chiefly of horizontal\r\nstrata of sandstone and limestone, exhibiting the appearance, on their\r\nabrupt sides, of regular layers of masonry, of towers, fortifications,\r\n&c. Now, among all these mountains, he observed, that the high or\r\nsteep sides look constantly down the rivers, while the sloping or\r\ninclined sides have just the opposite direction. When, in travelling\r\nnorthward, he passed the line of partition, where the waters from\r\nrunning south take their direction to the north, he found, that the\r\ngradual slope, which had hitherto been turned to the north, was now\r\nturned to the south: The abrupt aspect of the mountains, in like\r\nmanner, from facing the south, was directed to the north; so that,\r\nin both cases, the hills turned their backs on the line of greatest\r\nelevation.[184]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Barrow's Travels into Southern Africa, p. 245.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the form of this land has been\r\ndetermined by the slow working of the streams. The causes which\r\nproduced the effects here described, began their action from the line\r\nof greatest elevation, and extended it from thence on both sides, in\r\nopposite directions. This is the most precise character that can mark\r\nthe alluvial operations, and distinguish them from the overwhelming\r\npower of a great _debacle_.\r\n\r\n367. Lastly, if there were any where a hill, or any large mass composed\r\nof broken and shapeless stones, thrown together like rubbish, and\r\nneither worked into gravel nor disposed with any regularity, we must\r\nascribe it to some other cause than the ordinary _detritus_ and\r\nwasting of the land. This, however, has never yet occurred; and it\r\nseems best to wait till the phenomenon is observed, before we seek for\r\nthe explanation of it.\r\n\r\n368. These arguments appear to me conclusive against the necessity of\r\nsupposing the action of sudden and irregular causes on the surface of\r\nthe earth. In this, however, I am perhaps deceived: neither Pallas,\r\nnor Saussure, nor Dolomieu, nor any other author who has espoused\r\nthe hypothesis of such causes, has explained his notions with any\r\nprecision; on the contrary, they have all spoken with such reserve and\r\nmystery, as seemed to betray the weakness, but may have concealed the\r\nstrength of their cause. I have therefore been combating an enemy, that\r\nwas in some respects unknown; and I may have supposed him dislodged,\r\nonly because I could not penetrate to his strongholds. The question,\r\nhowever, is likely soon to assume a more determinate form. A zealous\r\nfriend of Dr Hutton's theory, has lately[185] declared his approbation\r\nof the hypothesis which has here been represented as so adverse to that\r\ntheory; and, from his ability and vigour of research, it is likely to\r\nreceive every improvement of which it is susceptible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: Trans. Royal Society Edin. vol. v. p 68.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XIX. § 117.\r\n\r\n               _Transportation of Materials by the Sea._\r\n\r\n\r\n369. THE existence of the great and extensive operations, by which the\r\nspoils of the land are carried all over the ocean, and spread out on\r\nthe bottom of it, may be supposed to require some further elucidation.\r\nWe must attend, therefore, to the following circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the detritus of the land is delivered by the rivers into the sea,\r\nthe heaviest parts are deposited first, and the lighter are carried\r\nto a greater distance from the shore. The accumulation of matter\r\nwhich would be made in this manner on the coast, is prevented by the\r\nfarther operation of the tides and currents, in consequence of which\r\nthe substances deposited continue to be worn away, and are gradually\r\nremoved farther from the land. The reality of this operation is\r\ncertain; for otherwise we should have on the sea shore a constant and\r\nunlimited accumulation of sand and gravel, which, being perpetually\r\nbrought down from the land, would continually increase on the shore, if\r\nnature did not employ some machinery for removing the advanced part\r\ninto the sea, in proportion to the supply from behind.\r\n\r\nThe constant agitation of the waters, and the declivity of the\r\nbottom, are no doubt the causes of this gradual and widely extended\r\ndeposition. A soft mass of alluvial deposit, having its pores filled\r\nwith water, and being subject to the vibrations of a superincumbent\r\nfluid, will yield to the pressure of that fluid on the side of the\r\nleast resistance, that is, on the side toward the sea, and thus will\r\nbe gradually extended more and more over the bottom. This will happen\r\nnot only to the finer parts of the detritus, but even to the grosser,\r\nsuch as sand and gravel. For suppose that a body of gravel rests on\r\na plane somewhat inclined, at the same time that it is covered with\r\nwater to a considerable depth, that water being subject not only to\r\nmoderate reciprocations, but also to such violent agitation as we see\r\noccasionally communicated to the waters of the ocean; the gravel,\r\nbeing rendered lighter by its immersion in the water, and on that\r\naccount more moveable, will, when the undulations are considerable,\r\nbe alternately heaved up and let down again. Now, at each time that\r\nit is heaved up, however small the space may be, it must be somewhat\r\naccelerated in its descent, and will hardly settle on the same point\r\nwhere it rested before. Thus it will gain a little ground at each\r\nundulation, and will slowly make its way towards the depths of the\r\nocean, or to the lowest situation it can reach. This, as far as we may\r\npresume to follow a progress which is not the subject of immediate\r\nobservation, is one of the great means by which loose materials of\r\nevery kind are transported to a great distance, and spread out in beds\r\nat the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\n370. The lighter parts are more easily carried to great distances,\r\nbeing actually suspended in the water, by which they are very gradually\r\nand slowly deposited. A remarkable proof of this is furnished from an\r\nobservation made by Lord Mulgrave, in his voyage to the North Pole.\r\nIn the latitude of 65° nearly, and about 250 miles distant from the\r\nnearest land, which was the coast of Norway, he sounded with a line of\r\n688 fathoms, or 4098 feet; and the lead, when it struck the ground,\r\nsunk in a soft blue clay to the depth of ten feet.[186] The tenuity\r\nand fineness of the mud, which allowed the lead to sink so deep into\r\nit, must have resulted from a deposition of the lighter kinds of\r\nearth, which being suspended in the water, had been carried to a great\r\ndistance, and were now without doubt forming a regular stratum at the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: Phipps's Voyage, p. 74, 141.]\r\n\r\n371. The quantity of detritus brought down by the rivers, and\r\ndistributed in this manner over the bottom of the sea, is so great,\r\nthat several narrow seas have been thereby rendered sensibly shallower.\r\nThe Baltic has been computed to decrease in depth at the rate of\r\nforty inches in a hundred years. The Yellow Sea, which is a large\r\ngulf contained between the coast of China and the peninsula of Corea,\r\nreceives so much mud from the great rivers that run into it, that it\r\ntakes its colour, as well as its name, from that circumstance; and the\r\nEuropean mariners who have lately navigated it, observed, that the\r\nmud was drawn up by the ships, so as to be visible in their wake to a\r\nconsiderable distance.[187] Computations have been made of the time\r\nthat it will require to fill up this gulf, and to withdraw it entirely\r\nfrom the dominion of the ocean: but the data are not sufficiently exact\r\nto afford any precise result, and are no doubt particularly defective\r\nfrom this cause, that much of the earth carried into the gulf by the\r\nrivers, must be carried out of it by the currents and tides, and\r\nthe finer parts wafted probably to great distances in the Pacific\r\nOcean.[188] The mere attempt, however, towards such a computation,\r\nshows how evident the progress of filling up is to every attentive\r\nobserver; and, though it may not ascertain the measure, it sufficiently\r\ndeclares the reality of the operations, by which the waste of the\r\npresent continents is made subservient to the formation of new land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Staunton's Account of the Embassy to China, vol. i. p.\r\n448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: Perouse, in sailing along the coast of China, from\r\nFormosa to the strait between Corea and Japan, though generally\r\nfifty or sixty leagues from the land, had soundings at the depth of\r\nforty-five fathoms, and sometimes at that of twenty-two. Atlas du\r\nVoyage de la Perouse, No. 43.]\r\n\r\n372. Sandbanks, such as abound in the German Ocean, to whatever they\r\nowe their origin, are certainly modified, and their form determined,\r\nby the tides and currents. Without the operation of these last, banks\r\nof loose sand and mud could hardly preserve their form, and remain\r\nintersected by many narrow channels. The formation of the banks on the\r\ncoast of Holland, and even of the Dogger Bank itself, has been ascribed\r\nto the meeting of tides, by which a state of tranquillity is produced\r\nin the waters, and of consequence a more copious deposition of their\r\nmud. Even the great bank of Newfoundland seems to be determined in its\r\nextent by the action of the Gulf stream. In the North Sea, the current\r\nwhich sets out of the Baltic, has evidently determined the shape of\r\nthe sandbanks opposite to the coast of Norway, and produced a circular\r\nsweep in them, of which it is impossible to mistake the cause.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the action here ascribed to the waters of the sea, in\r\ntransporting materials to an unlimited extent, we may add the well\r\nknown observation, that the stones brought up by the lead from the\r\nbottom of the sea, are generally round and polished, hardly ever sharp\r\nand angular. This could never happen to stones that were not subject to\r\nperpetual attrition.\r\n\r\n373. Currents are no doubt the great agents in diffusing the detritus\r\nof the land over the bottom of the sea. These have been long known to\r\nexist; but it is only since the later improvements in navigation, that\r\nthey have been understood to constitute a system of great permanence,\r\nregularity, and extent, connected with the trade winds, and other\r\ncircumstances in the natural history of the globe. The Gulf stream was\r\nmany years since observed to transport the water, and the temperature\r\nof the tropical regions into the climates of the north; and we are\r\nindebted to the researches of Major RENNELL, for the knowledge of a\r\ngreat system of currents, of which it is only a part. That geographer,\r\nwho is so eminent for enriching the details of his science with the\r\nmost interesting facts in history or in physics, has shown, that\r\nalong the eastern coast of Africa, from about the mouth of the Red\r\nSea, a current fifty leagues in breadth sets continually towards the\r\nsouth-west.[189] It doubles the Cape of Good Hope, runs from thence\r\nnorth-west, preserving on the whole the direction of the coast, but\r\nreaching so far into the ocean, that, about the parallel of St Helena,\r\nits breadth exceeds 1000 miles. From thence, as it approaches the line,\r\nits direction is more nearly east; and meeting in the parallel of 3°\r\nnorth, with a current which has come along the western coast of Africa\r\nfrom the north, the two united stretch across the Atlantic, in a line\r\nsomewhat south of west, and in a very wide and rapid stream. This\r\nstream meets the American land at Cape St Roque, where it is joined\r\nby another coming up along the eastern shore of that continent, and\r\ndirected towards the north. They proceed northward together till they\r\nenter the Gulf of Florida, from which being as it were reflected, they\r\nform the Gulf stream, passing along the coast of North America, and\r\nstretching across the Atlantic to the British Isles. From thence the\r\ncurrent turns to the south, and, proceeding down the coast of Spain\r\nand Africa, meets the stream ascending from the south, as already\r\ndescribed, and thus continues in perpetual circulation. The velocity of\r\nthese currents is not less remarkable than their extent. At the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, the rate is thirty nautical miles in twenty four hours;\r\nin some places forty five; and under the line seventy seven. When the\r\nGulf stream issues from the Straits of Bahama, it runs at the rate of\r\nfour miles an hour, and proceeds to the distance of 1800 miles, before\r\nits velocity is reduced to half that quantity. In the parallel of 38°,\r\nnear 1000 miles from the above strait, the water of the stream has been\r\nfound ten degrees warmer than the air.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Geography of Herodotus, p. 672.]\r\n\r\n374. The course of the Gulf stream is so fixed and regular, that\r\nnuts and plants from the West Indies are annually thrown ashore on\r\nthe Western Islands of Scotland. The mast of a man of war, burnt at\r\nJamaica, was driven several months afterwards on the Hebrides,[190]\r\nafter performing a voyage of more than 4000 miles, under the direction\r\nof a current, which, in the midst of the ocean, maintains its course as\r\nsteadily as a river does upon the land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Pennant's Arctic Zoology, Introd. p. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe great system of currents thus traced through the Atlantic, has no\r\ndoubt phenomena corresponding to it in the Indian and Pacific Oceans,\r\nwhich the industry of future navigators may discover. The whole appears\r\nto be connected with the trade winds, the figure of our continents, the\r\ntemperature of the seas themselves, and perhaps with some inequalities\r\nin the structure of the globe. The disturbance produced by these causes\r\nin the equilibrium of the sea, probably reaches to the very bottom of\r\nit, and gives rise to those counter currents, which have sometimes been\r\ndiscovered at great depths under the surface.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Histoire Naturelle de Buffon, Supplément, tom. ix. p.\r\n479. 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe great transportation of materials that must result from the\r\naction of these combined currents is obvious, and serves not a little\r\nto diminish our wonder, at finding the productions of one climate\r\nso frequently included among the fossils of another. Amid all the\r\nrevolutions of the globe, the economy of nature has been uniform, in\r\nthis respect, as well as in so many others, and her laws are the only\r\nthing that have resisted the general movement. The rivers and the\r\nrocks, the seas and the continents, have been changed in all their\r\nparts; but the laws which direct those changes, and the rules to which\r\nthey are subject, have remained invariably the same.\r\n\r\n375. Objections have been made to that translation of materials by the\r\nwaters of the ocean which is supposed in this theory, particularly\r\nby Mr Kirwan, in his Geological Essays; and, though I might perhaps\r\ncontent myself with the remark already made, that the Neptunian system\r\ninvolves suppositions concerning the transportation of solid bodies by\r\nthe sea, in the early ages of the world, as wonderful as those which,\r\naccording to our theory, are common to all ages, I am unwilling to\r\nremain satisfied with a mere _argumentum ad hominem_, where the fallacy\r\nof the reasoning is so easily detected.\r\n\r\n376. One of Mr Kirwan's objections to the deposition of materials at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, is thus stated: \"FRISI has remarked, in his\r\nmathematical discourses, that if any considerable mass of matter were\r\naccumulated in the interior of the ocean, the diurnal motion of the\r\nglobe would be disturbed, and consequently it would be perceptible;\r\na phenomenon, however, of which no history or tradition gives any\r\naccount.\"[192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: Geol. Essays, p. 441.]\r\n\r\nThe appeal made here to Frisi is singularly unfortunate, as that\r\nphilosopher has demonstrated the very contrary of Mr Kirwan's\r\nposition, and has proved, that the disturbance given to the diurnal\r\nmotion by the causes here referred to may be real, but cannot be\r\nperceptible. Having investigated a formula expressing the law which\r\nall such disturbances must necessarily observe, he concludes, \"Hàc\r\nautem formulâ manifestum fiet, ex iis omnibus variationibus quæ in\r\nterrestri superficie observari solent, montium et collium abrasione,\r\ndilapsu corporum ponderosiorum in inferiores telluris sinus, nullam\r\noriri posse variationem _sensibilem_ diurni motûs. Nam si statuamus\r\ndata aliqua annorum periodo terrestrem superficiem ad duos usque pedes\r\nabradi undique, eam vero materiæ quantitatem ad profunditatem pedum\r\n1000 dilabi; erit omne quod inde orietur incrementum velocitatis diurni\r\nmotûs 30000/(19638051)^2 = 1/12855068184.\"[193]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: Frisii Opera, tom. iii. p. 269.]\r\n\r\nHere, it is evident, that Frisi admits those very changes on the\r\nsurface which we are contending for, and shows, that their tendency is\r\nto accelerate the earth's diurnal motion, but, by a quantity so small,\r\nthat, in a space of time amounting at least to 200 years, the increase\r\nof the diurnal motion would only be such a part of the whole as the\r\npreceding fraction is of unity.[194]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: The time requisite for taking away by waste and erosion\r\ntwo feet from the surface of all our continents, and depositing it at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, cannot be reckoned less than 200 years. The\r\nfraction 1/12855068184, reduced to parts of a day, is 1/148554 of a\r\nsecond; so that it would require 200 years to shorten the length of\r\nthe day, by the above fraction of a second; and therefore it would\r\nrequire 148554 times 200 years, or 29710800 years, to diminish it an\r\nentire second. The accumulated effect, however, of all the diminutions\r\nduring that period, would amount to much more: and if we had any\r\nperfectly uniform standard to compare the motion of the earth with,\r\nits difference from that standard would increase as the squares of the\r\ntime, and the total acceleration would amount to one second in 77080\r\nyears. Whatever relation this bears to the age of the globe itself, it\r\nexceeds more than ten times the age of any historical record.\r\n\r\nThough Frisius concludes, as is stated here, that the acceleration\r\nproduced in the diurnal motion of the earth, is far too inconsiderable\r\nto become the object of astronomical observation, he makes a\r\nsupposition difficult to be reconciled with this conclusion, namely,\r\nthat the acceleration has had a sensible effect on the figure of the\r\nearth, or rather of the sea, having increased the centrifugal force,\r\nand thereby accumulated the waters under the equator, in the present,\r\nmore than in former ages. Such an accumulation, he thinks agreeable\r\nto certain appearances that have been observed respecting the ancient\r\nlevel of the sea. These appearances will be afterwards considered: it\r\nis sufficient to remark here, that though the fraction, expressing the\r\nincrement of the centrifugal force, must be double that which expresses\r\nthe acceleration, it must be too small to have any perceptible effect\r\nin elevating the sea, except after an immense interval of time; and the\r\ncompensations which arise from other causes, probably must prevent it\r\nfrom becoming sensible in any length of time whatsoever.]\r\n\r\n377. The instance just given may serve as one of many, to shew what\r\nconfidence is to be placed in that indigested mass of facts and\r\nquotations which Mr Kirwan, without discrimination, and without\r\ndiscussion, has brought together from all quarters. He has no\r\nintention, I believe, to deceive his readers; but we may judge, from\r\nthis specimen, of the precautions he has taken against being deceived\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, the result of Frisi's investigation must be\r\nconsidered as imperfect. If there were no relative motion in the parts\r\nof our globe, but that by which things descend from a higher to a lower\r\nlevel, a continual acceleration of its rotation, though extremely slow,\r\nwould take place, as above computed. But as, in the interior of the\r\nearth, there are undoubtedly motions of a tendency opposite to those on\r\nthe surface, and directed from the centre towards the circumference,\r\nthey must produce a retardation in the diurnal revolution; and from\r\nthis must arise an inequality, not uniformly progressive in the same\r\ndirection, but periodical, and confined within certain limits, as the\r\ncauses are by which it is produced.[195]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Even in the descent of bodies from a higher to a lower\r\nlevel at the surface of the earth, the whole tendency is not to\r\nincrease the velocity of the earth's rotation, and many compensations\r\ntake place, which, when the matter is considered only in general,\r\nare necessarily overlooked. This will appear evident, if we reflect,\r\nthat it is not simply the approach of a body towards the centre of\r\nthe earth, or its removal from that centre, which tends to disturb\r\nthe rotation of the earth; but its approach to the axis of the earth,\r\nor its removal from that axis. The velocity with which a particle of\r\nmatter revolves, whether on the surface, or in the interior of the\r\nglobe, is proportional to its distance from the axis of rotation;\r\nand therefore, when a body comes nearer to the axis, it loses a part\r\nof the motion which it had before; which part, of consequence, is\r\ncommunicated to the whole mass of the earth, and therefore tends to\r\nincrease the velocity with which it revolves. The contrary happens when\r\na body recedes from the axis; for it then receives an addition to its\r\nvelocity, which, of course, is taken away from the rotatory motion of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nHence, bodies moving in a horizontal plane, may increase or diminish\r\nthe swiftness of the diurnal motion, according as they move towards the\r\npoles or towards the equator; and those which descend from a higher to\r\na lower level, disturb the earth's rotation, much more in consequence\r\nof their horizontal, than of their perpendicular motion. The Ganges,\r\nfor instance, though its source is probably elevated no less than\r\n7000 feet above the level of the sea, tends to retard the earth's\r\nrotation, by bringing its waters, and the mud contained in them, from\r\nthe parallel of 31° to that of 22°, and so increasing their distance\r\nfrom the earth's axis by more than 1/12 th part. Had the Ganges flowed\r\ntowards the north, as the Nile does, its effect would have been just\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, a stone descending from the top of a mountain, may\r\naccelerate or retard the earth's rotation, according to the direction\r\nin which it descends. If it descend on the side of the elevated pole,\r\nit will then produce acceleration, because its distance from the axis\r\nwill be diminished; but if it descend on the side of the depressed\r\npole, and if the direction in which it is moved, be over a line less\r\ninclined, than a line drawn from the same point to the depressed pole,\r\nit will then produce a retardation, because its distance from the axis\r\nwill be increased.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for example, that the top of Mount Blanc is in latitude\r\n45° 49′, and that its height is 2450 toises above the level of the sea.\r\nThe point at which a line drawn from the top of this mountain, parallel\r\nto the earth's axis, will meet the superficies of the sea, (supposing\r\nthat superficies continued inland from the Mediterranean), must be\r\nabout 2382 toises in horizontal distance, or about 2-1/2 minutes south\r\nof the summit, that is, in the parallel of 45° 46-1/2′; and if this\r\nparallel be continued all round the globe, the points of the earth's\r\nsurface between it and the equator, are all more distant from the\r\nearth's axis than the top of Mount Blanc is; whereas all the points\r\nto the north of it are nearer to that axis. A stone, therefore, from\r\nthe top of Mount Blanc, if carried any where to the south of the above\r\nparallel, will retard the earth's diurnal motion; but if carried any\r\nwhere to the north of the same line, will accelerate that motion.\r\n\r\nThe same quantity of matter, however, carried an equal distance\r\ntoward the pole, and toward the equator, from any point, will lose\r\nmore velocity in the former case than it will gain in the latter, as\r\neasily follows from the nature of circle. Therefore, supposing an equal\r\ndispersion of the detritus of a mountain in all directions, the parts\r\nthat go toward the pole will most disturb the diurnal motion; and hence\r\na balance on their side, or in favour of acceleration, as already\r\nobserved.]\r\n\r\n378. Mr Kirwan's second objection is founded on the misapprehension\r\nof a well-known fact in the natural history of the earth. \"Rivers,\"\r\nsays this author, \"do not carry into the sea the spoils which they\r\nbring from the land, but employ them in the formation of deltas of low\r\nalluvial land at their mouths, according to what Major Rennell has\r\nproved.\" The fact of the formation of _deltas_ from the spoils which\r\nthe rivers carry from the higher grounds, is perfectly ascertained;\r\nand the detail into which Major Rennell has entered in the passage\r\nreferred to by Mr Kirwan, does credit to the acuteness and accuracy\r\nof that excellent geographer. But it is not there asserted, that\r\nrivers employ _all_ the materials which they carry with them, in the\r\nformation of those deltas, and deliver none of them into the sea. On\r\nthe contrary, they carry from the _delta_ itself mud and earth, which\r\nthey can deposit no where but in the sea; and it is this circumstance\r\nchiefly that limits the increase of those alluvial lands, and makes\r\nthem either cease to increase, or makes them increase very slowly after\r\na certain period, though the supply of earth from the higher grounds\r\nremains nearly the same. To make Mr Kirwan's argument conclusive, it\r\nwould be necessary to prove, that _all_ the mud carried down by the\r\nNile or the Ganges, was deposited on the low lands before these rivers\r\nenter the sea; a thing so obviously absurd, that nothing but his haste\r\nto obtain a conclusion unfavourable to the Plutonic system, could have\r\nprevented him from perceiving it[196].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: The instance mentioned in the Geological Essays, from\r\nthe travels of the Abbé Fortis, concerning urns thrown into the\r\nAdriatic, upwards of 1400 years ago, and not yet covered with mud,\r\nmust be explained from peculiar circumstances, or local causes, with\r\nwhich we are unacquainted, as it makes against the deposition of earth\r\nnear the shore, and in narrow seas; a general fact which, I think,\r\nevery body admits.]\r\n\r\n379. A remark which Major Rennell has made concerning the mouths of\r\nrivers, in his Geography of Herodotus, deserves Mr Kirwan's attention,\r\nthough perhaps he may not be able to put on it an interpretation quite\r\nso favourable to his system. The remark is, that the mouths of great\r\nrivers are often formed on principles quite opposite to one another, so\r\nthat some of them have a real delta or triangle of flat land at their\r\nmouths, while others have an estuary, or what may not improperly be\r\ncalled a _negative_ delta. Of the latter kind are some of the greatest\r\nrivers in the world, the Plata, the Oroonoko and the Maranon, and by\r\nfar the greatest number of our European rivers. Nobody can doubt, that\r\nthe three rivers just named carry with them as much earth as the Nile,\r\nor the Euphrates, or any other river in the world. All this they have\r\ndeposited in the sea, and committed to the currents, which sweep along\r\nthe shore of the American continent, and by these they have been spread\r\nout over the unlimited tracts of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing can be more just than Dr Hutton's observation, that\r\nwhere low land is formed at the mouths of rivers, there the rivers\r\nbring down more than the sea is able to carry away; but that where\r\nsuch land is not formed, it is because the sea is able to carry off\r\nimmediately all the deposit which it receives.\r\n\r\n380. Mr Kirwan has denied on another principle the power of the sea to\r\ncarry to a distance the materials delivered into it: \"Notwithstanding,\"\r\nsays he, \"many particles of earth are by rivers conduced to the sea,\r\nyet _none are conveyed in any distance_, but are either deposited at\r\ntheir mouths, or rejected by currents or by tides; and the reason\r\nis, because the tide of flood is always more impetuous and forcible\r\nthan the tide of ebb, the advancing waves being pressed forward by\r\nthe countless number behind them, whereas the retreating are pressed\r\nbackward by a far smaller number, as must be evident to an attentive\r\nspectator; and hence it is that all floating things cast into the sea,\r\nare at last thrown on shore, and not conveyed into the mid regions of\r\nthe sea, as they should be if the reciprocal undulations of the tides\r\nwere equally powerful \"[197]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Kirwan's Geol. Essays, p. 439.]\r\n\r\n381. But if the _attentive spectator_, instead of trusting to a vague\r\nimpression, or listening to some crude theory of undulations, reflects\r\non one of the most simple facts respecting the ebbing and flowing of\r\nthe tides, he will be very little disposed to acquiesce in the above\r\nconclusion. He has only to consider, that the flowing of the tide\r\nrequires just six hours, and the ebbing of it likewise six hours; so\r\nthat the same body of water flows in upon the shore, and retreats from\r\nit, in the same time. The quantity of matter moved, therefore, and the\r\nvelocity with which it is moved, are in both cases the same; and it\r\nremains for Mr Kirwan to show in what the difference of their force can\r\npossibly consist.\r\n\r\nThe force with which the waves usually break upon our shores, does not\r\narise from the velocity of the tide being greater in one direction\r\nthan in another. In the main ocean, the waves have no progressive\r\nmotion, and the columns of water alternately rise and fall, without\r\nany other than a reciprocating motion: a kind of equilibrium takes\r\nplace among the undulations, and each wave being equally acted upon by\r\nthose on opposite sides, remains fixed in its place. Near the shore\r\nthis cannot happen; the water on the land side from its shallowness\r\nbeing incapable of rising to the height necessary to balance the\r\ngreat undulations which are without. The water runs, therefore, as it\r\nwere, from a higher to a lower level, spreading itself towards the\r\nland side. This produces the breakers on our shores, and the surf\r\nof the tropical seas. A rock or a sandbank coming within a certain\r\ndistance of the surface, is sufficient, in any part of the ocean, to\r\nobstruct the natural succession of undulations; and, by destroying the\r\nmutual reaction of the waves, to give them a progressive instead of a\r\nreciprocating motion.\r\n\r\n382. It is, however, but from a small distance, that the waves are\r\nimpelled against the shore with a progressive motion. The border of\r\nbreakers that surrounds any coast is narrow, compared with the distance\r\nto which the _detritus_ from the land is confessedly carried; the\r\nwater, while it advances at the surface, flows back at the bottom;\r\nand these contrary motions are so nearly equal, that it is but a very\r\nmomentary accumulation of the water that is ever produced on any shore.\r\n\r\nIf it were otherwise, and if it were true that the sea throws out every\r\nthing, and carries away nothing, we should have a constant accumulation\r\nof earth and sand along all shores whatsoever, at least wherever a\r\nstream ran into the sea. This, as is abundantly evident, is quite\r\ncontrary to the fact.\r\n\r\nSo, also, the bars formed at the mouths of rivers, after having\r\nattained a certain magnitude, increase no farther, not because they\r\ncease to receive augmentations from the land, but because their\r\ndiminution from the sea, increasing with their magnitude, becomes at\r\nlength so great, as completely to balance those augmentations. When\r\nproperly examined, therefore, the phenomena, which have been proposed\r\nas most inconsistent with the indefinite transportation of stony\r\nbodies, afford very satisfactory proofs of that operation.\r\n\r\n383. It is true, that bodies which float in the water, when carried\r\nalong on the tops of the waves towards a shelving beach, having\r\nacquired a certain velocity, are thrown farther in upon the land than\r\nthe distance they would have floated to, if they had been simply\r\nsustained by the water. The depth of water, therefore, at the place\r\nwhere they take the ground, is not likely to be such as to float them\r\nagain, and to carry them out towards the sea. They are, therefore, left\r\nbehind; and this produces an appearance of a force impelling floating\r\nbodies towards the land, much greater and more general than really\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nThese observations may serve to show, how unsound the principles are\r\nfrom which Mr Kirwan's conclusions are deduced: they are perhaps more\r\nthan is necessary for that purpose: it might have been sufficient to\r\nobserve, that the increase of land on the sea shore is limited, though\r\nthe augmentation from the land is certainly indefinite, a proof that\r\nthe diminution from the sea is constant and equal to the increase.\r\n\r\n384. \"Mariners,\" says Mr Kirwan, \"were accustomed, for some centuries\r\nback, to discover their situation, by the kind of earth or sand brought\r\nup by their sounding plummets; a method which would prove fallacious,\r\nif the surface of the bottom did not continue invariably the same.\"[198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Geol. Essays, p. 440.]\r\n\r\nThe fact here stated, that mariners, when navigation was more imperfect\r\nthan it is now, had very frequent recourse to this method, and that\r\nthey still use it occasionally, is very true. But from this, the only\r\ninference that can be fairly deduced is, that the changes at the bottom\r\nof the sea are very slow, and the variation but little; not merely\r\nfrom one year to another, but even from one century to another. The\r\nrules by which the mariner judged of his position from the quality of\r\nthe earth which the lead brought up, and which were deduced no doubt\r\nfrom observations made at no very great distance of time, might be\r\nsufficient for his purpose, though a slow change had been all the while\r\ngoing forward. Such observations could at best have little accuracy,\r\nand could not be affected by small variations. It is the slowness of\r\nthe change, that makes the experience of one age applicable, in this,\r\nas in innumerable other instances, to the observations of the next. If\r\na long interval is taken, we will look in vain for the same uniformity\r\nof results. A pilot, who would at present judge of his position in the\r\nGerman Ocean, by comparing his soundings with those taken by PYTHEAS,\r\n(supposing them known) in his navigation of that sea, more than 2000\r\nyears ago, could hardly be expected to determine his latitude and\r\nlongitude with great exactness; and I know not if the most zealous\r\nadvocate for the immutability of the earth's surface, would be willing\r\nto trust his safety in a ship that was guided by such antiquated rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE XX. § 118.\r\n\r\n               _Inequalities in the Planetary Motions._\r\n\r\n\r\n385. The assertion that, in the planetary motions, we discover no\r\nmark, either of the commencement or termination of the present order,\r\nrefers to the late discoveries of LA GRANGE and LA PLACE, which have\r\ncontributed so much to the perfection of physical astronomy. From\r\nthe principle of universal gravitation, these mathematicians have\r\ndemonstrated, that all the variations in our system are periodical;\r\nthat they are confined within certain limits; and consist of alternate\r\ndiminution and increase. The orbits of the planets change not only\r\ntheir position, but even their magnitude and their form: the longer\r\naxis of each has a slow angular motion; and, though its length remains\r\nfixed, the shorter axis increases and diminishes, so that the form of\r\nthe orbit approaches to that of a circle, and recedes from it by turns.\r\nIn the same manner, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the inclination\r\nof the planetary orbits, are subject to change; but the changes are\r\nsmall, and, being first in one direction, and then in the opposite,\r\nthey can never accumulate so as to produce a permanent or a progressive\r\nalteration. Thus, in the celestial motions, no room is left for the\r\nintroduction of disorder; no irregularity or disturbance, arising from\r\nthe mutual action of the planets, is permitted to increase beyond\r\ncertain limits, but each of them, in time, affords a correction for\r\nitself. The general order is constant, in the midst of the variation of\r\nthe parts; and, in the language of La Place, there is a certain mean\r\ncondition, about which our system perpetually _oscillates_ performing\r\nsmall vibrations on each side of it, and never receding from it\r\nfar.[199] The system is thus endowed with a stability, which can refill\r\nthe lapse of unlimited duration; it can only perish by an external\r\ncause, and by the introduction of laws, of which at present no vestige\r\nis to be traced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Exposition du Systéme du Monde, par La Place, Livre iv.\r\nchap. 6. p. 199. 2d edit.]\r\n\r\n386. The same _calculus_ to which we are indebted for these sublime\r\nconclusions, informs us of two circumstances, which mark the law\r\nhere treated of as an effect of wise design, to the entire exclusion\r\nboth of necessity and chance. One of these circumstances consists in\r\nthe planetary motions being all in the same direction, or all _in\r\nconsequentia_ as it is called by the astronomers. This is essential\r\nto the compensation and stability above mentioned:[200] had one planet\r\ncirculated round the sun in a direction from east to west, and another\r\nin a direction from west to east, the disturbances they would have\r\nproduced on one another's motion would not necessarily have been\r\nperiodical; their irregularities might have continually increased, and\r\nthey might have deviated in the course of ages from their original\r\ncondition, beyond any limits that can be assigned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: La Place, _ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance, on which the stability of our system depends,\r\nis the small eccentricity of the planetary orbits, or their near\r\napproach to circles. Were their orbits very eccentric, an opening\r\nwould be given to progressive change, that might so far increase, as\r\nto prove the destruction of the whole. But neither the movement of all\r\nthe planets in the same direction, nor the small eccentricity of their\r\norbits, can be ascribed to accident, since that either of these should\r\nhappen by chance, in as many instances as there are planets, both\r\nprimary and secondary, is almost infinitely improbable. Again, that any\r\nnecessity in the nature of things should have either determined the\r\n_direction_ of the planetary motions, or proportioned the _quantity_\r\nof them to the intensity of the central force, cannot be admitted, as\r\nthese are things unavoidably conceived to be quite independent of one\r\nanother. It remains, therefore, that we consider the laws, which make\r\nthe disturbances in our system correct themselves, and by that means\r\ngive firmness and permanence to it, as a proof of the consummate wisdom\r\nwith which the whole is constructed.\r\n\r\n387. The geological system of Dr Hutton, resembles, in many respects,\r\nthat which appears to preside over the heavenly motions. In both, we\r\nperceive continual vicissitude and change, but confined within certain\r\nlimits, and never from a certain, mean condition, which is such, that,\r\nin the lapse of time, the deviations from it on the one side, must\r\nbecome just equal to the deviations from it on the other. In both, a\r\nprovision is made for duration of unlimited extent, and the lapse of\r\ntime has no effect to wear out or destroy a machine, constructed with\r\nso much wisdom. Where the movements are all so perfect, their beginning\r\nand end must be alike invisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XXI. § 122.\r\n\r\n                       _Changes in the apparent\r\n                           Level of the Sea._\r\n\r\n\r\n388. In speaking of the natural epochs marked out by the phenomena\r\nof the mineral kingdom, we have supposed a greater simplicity, and\r\nseparation of effects from one another, than probably takes place in\r\nnature. We have, for instance, abstracted, in speaking of the waste\r\nand degradation of the land, from that elevation which may have been\r\ncarried on at the same time. This appeared necessary to be done, in\r\norder to simplify as much as possible the view that was to be given of\r\nthe whole; but there can be no doubt, that, while the land has been\r\ngradually worn down by the operations on its surface, it has been\r\nraised up by the expansive forces acting from below. There is even\r\nreason to think, that the elevation has not been uniform, but has been\r\nsubject to a kind of oscillation, insomuch, that the continents have\r\nboth ascended and descended, or have had their level alternately raised\r\nand depressed, independently of all action at the surface, and this\r\nwithin a period comparatively of no great extent.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood, that the facts we are going to state,\r\neach taken singly, prove nothing more than a change of the line in\r\nwhich the surface of the sea intersects the surface of the land,\r\nleaving it uncertain to which of the two the change ought really to be\r\nascribed. Taken in combination, however, these facts may determine what\r\neach of them separately cannot ascertain. I shall first, therefore,\r\nmention some of the principal observations relative to the change above\r\nmentioned, and shall then compare them, in order to discover whether it\r\nis most probable that this change has been produced by the motion of\r\nthe land or of the sea.\r\n\r\n389. If we begin with examining the coasts of our own island, we shall\r\nfind clear evidence every where, that the sea once reached higher up\r\nupon the land than it does at present. The marks of an ancient sea\r\nbeach are to be seen beyond the present limits of the tide, and beds\r\nof sea shells, not mineralized, are found in the loose earth or soil,\r\nsometimes as high as thirty feet above the present level of the sea.\r\nSome of these on the shores of the Frith of Forth are very well known,\r\nand have been often mentioned. Indeed, on the shores of that frith,\r\nmany monuments appear, which would seem to carry the difference\r\nbetween the present and the ancient level of the sea, to more than\r\nforty feet. The ground on which the Botanic Garden of Edinburgh is\r\nsituated, after a thin covering of soil is removed, consists entirely\r\nof sea sand, very regularly stratified, with layers of a black\r\ncarbonaceous matter, in thin lamellæ, interposed between them. Shells I\r\nbelieve are but rarely found in it, but it has every other appearance\r\nof a sea beach. The height of this ground above the present level of\r\nthe sea is certainly not less than forty feet.\r\n\r\n390. On almost every part of the coast where the rocks do not rise\r\nquite abrupt and precipitous from the sea, similar marks of the\r\nlowering of the sea, or the rising of the land, may be observed. On the\r\nshores opposite to ours, the same appearances are remarked. The author\r\nof the Lettre Critique to M. de Buffon, tells us, that he had found\r\nthe bottom of a bason at Dunkirk, which he had reason to think was dug\r\nabout 950 years ago, ten feet and a half above the present low water\r\nmark, though it must have been originally under it. The bottom of this\r\nbason is in the native chalk. From this, the same author concludes,\r\nthat the sea at Dunkirk lowers its level at the rate of an inch nearly\r\nin seven years. The observation was made in 1762, (Lettre à M. le\r\nComte de Buffon, &c. p. 55.)[201]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: In the county of Suffolk, near Wood Bridge, at the\r\ndistance of seven or eight miles from the sea, are the Crag-pits, in\r\nwhich prodigious quantities of sea shells are discovered, many of them\r\nperfect and quite solid, (Pennant's Arctic Zoology, Introd. p. 6.)\r\nLincolnshire affords various proofs of the same kind; but some other\r\ncircumstances in the appearance of that coast, just about to be taken\r\nnotice of, indicate changes of a more complicated nature.]\r\n\r\n391. The shores of the Low Countries, and of Holland, have been often\r\ninstanced in proof of the same kind of changes, and it has been\r\nsupposed, that, independently of those artificial barriers which at\r\npresent exclude the waters of the ocean from overflowing a great part\r\nof this tract, nature herself has brought it nearer to the surface\r\nthan it had formerly been. It is indeed certain, that those countries,\r\nto a very great extent inland, have either been under the sea at some\r\nperiod, by no means remote if compared with the great revolutions of\r\nthe globe, or that they are entirely alluvial, and of the same sort\r\nwith the Deltas formed at the mouths of rivers. The relative changes,\r\nhowever, of the sea and land on this tract, have been differently\r\nrepresented, and I am unwilling, on that account, to found any\r\nargument on them.\r\n\r\n392. If we proceed farther to the north, to the shores of the Baltic\r\nfor instance, we have undoubted evidence of a change of level in the\r\nsame direction as on our own shores. The level of this sea has been\r\nrepresented as lowering at so great a rate as 40 inches in a century.\r\nCelsius observed, that several rocks which are now above water,\r\nwere not long ago sunken rocks, and dangerous to navigators; and he\r\nparticularly took notice of one, which, in the year 1680, was on the\r\nsurface of the water, and in the year 1791 was 20-1/2 Swedish inches\r\nabove it. From an inscription near Aspô, in the lake Melar, which\r\ncommunicates with the Baltic, engraved, as is supposed, about five\r\ncenturies ago, the level of the sea appears to have sunk in that time\r\nno less than 13 Swedish feet.[202] All these facts, with many more\r\nwhich it is unnecessary to enumerate, make the gradual depression,\r\nnot only of the Baltic, but of the whole northern ocean, a matter of\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Frisii Opera, tom. iii. p. 274.]\r\n\r\n393. Supposing these changes of level between the sea and land to be\r\nsufficiently ascertained, the supposition which at first occurs is,\r\nthat the motion has been in the sea rather than in the land, and that\r\nthe former has actually descended to a lower level. The imagination\r\nnaturally feels less difficulty in conceiving, that an unstable\r\nfluid like the sea, which changes its level twice every day, has\r\nundergone a permanent depression in its surface, than that the land,\r\nthe _terra firma_ itself, has admitted of an equal elevation. In all\r\nthis, however, we are guided much more by fancy than reason; for, in\r\norder to depress or elevate the absolute level of the sea, by a given\r\nquantity, in any one place, we must depress or elevate it by the same\r\nquantity over the whole surface of the earth; whereas no such necessity\r\nexists with respect to the elevation or depression of the land. To\r\nmake the sea subside 30 feet all round the coast of Great Britain, it\r\nis necessary to displace a body of water 30 feet deep over the whole\r\nsurface of the ocean. The quantity of matter to be moved in that way is\r\nincomparably greater than if the land itself were to be elevated; for\r\nthough it is nearly three times less in specific gravity, it is as much\r\ngreater in bulk, as the surface of the ocean is greater than that of\r\nthis island.\r\n\r\n394. Besides, the sea cannot change its level, without a proportional\r\nchange in the solid bottom on which it rests. Though there be reason to\r\nsuppose that such changes in the bottom do actually take place, yet\r\nthey are probably much slower and more imperceptible than those which\r\nwe are here considering. It is evident, therefore, that the simplest\r\nhypothesis for explaining those changes of level, is, that they proceed\r\nfrom the motion, upwards or downwards, of the land itself, and not\r\nfrom that of the sea. As no elevation or depression of the sea can\r\ntake place, but over the whole, its level cannot be affected by local\r\ncauses, and is probably as little subject to variation as any thing to\r\nbe met with on the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n395. Other observations, however, made on different shores from the\r\npreceding, give greater certainty to this conclusion, and make it\r\nclear, that the motion or change which we are now treating of is not to\r\nbe ascribed to the sea itself.\r\n\r\nThe observations just mentioned prove, that the level of the North\r\nSea is lower now than it was heretofore; but it appears, that in the\r\nMediterranean, the opposite takes place. Very accurate observations\r\nmade by MANFREDI, render it certain, that the superficies of the\r\nHadriatic was higher about the middle of the last century, than toward\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nSome repairs that were carrying on in the cathedral church of Ravenna,\r\nin the year 1731, afforded him an opportunity of observing, that the\r\nancient, and probably original, pavement, was four feet and a half\r\nbelow the present, and nearly a foot under the level of the sea at high\r\nwater.[203] Now, when the church was built, this cannot have been the\r\nposition of the pavement, relatively to the level of the sea, for it\r\nwould have subjected the floor to be under water twice in twenty-four\r\nhours, and must have done so the more unavoidably, because at that time\r\n(the beginning of the fifth century) the walls of Ravenna were washed\r\nby the sea. The fact that this pavement is under the high-water mark,\r\nby the quantity just mentioned, was ascertained by actual levelling.\r\nThis result was confirmed by similar facts, observed by ZENDRINI at\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Commentarii Academiæ Bononiensis, tom. ii. pars 1ma, p.\r\n237, &c. and pars 2da, p. 1. &c.]\r\n\r\n396. Manfredi himself attributes all this to the elevation of the\r\nsurface of the sea, and has entered into a long calculation to\r\nascertain at what rate that surface may be supposed to rise, on account\r\nof the earth and sand brought down by the rivers, and spread out over\r\nthe bottom of the sea. But as the fact of the rise of the level of the\r\nsea is not general, and as the contrary is observed in the north seas,\r\nas already proved, this hypothesis will not explain the apparent rise\r\nin the level of the Hadriatic.\r\n\r\n397. Though a local subsidence, or settling of the ground, could hardly\r\naccount for this change, the pavement being perfect in its level, and\r\nthe walls of the cathedral without any shake, yet a subsidence that\r\nhas extended to a great tract, as to the whole of Italy, if the mass\r\nmoved has continued parallel to itself, and changed its place slowly,\r\nwill agree very well with the appearances. The facts here stated are\r\nalso the more deserving of attention, that about Ravenna, the land, at\r\nthe same time that it has sunk in its level, has extended its surface,\r\nand has encroached on the sea. Since the time of AUGUSTUS, the line\r\nof the coast has been carried farther out by about three miles.[204]\r\nThis last is the undoubted effect of the degradation of the land by the\r\nrivers; and here we have very clear evidence of the forces, both under\r\nand above the surface, producing their respective effects at the same\r\ntime, so that while the surface is raised by earth brought down by the\r\nrivers, every given point in the ground is depressed and let down to a\r\nlower level.[205]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Manfredi, _ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: On the coast of Dalmatia also, the rising of the level\r\nof the sea has been remarked, particularly at the ruins of Diocletian's\r\npalace of Spalatro.]\r\n\r\n398. On the southern coast of Italy similar facts have been observed.\r\nBREISLAC, in his _Topographia Fisica della Campagnia di Roma_,[206]\r\nfrom certain appearances in the Gulfs of Baja and Naples, concludes,\r\nthat at the beginning of the Christian era, the level of the sea was\r\nlower on that part of the coast than it is now. The facts which he\r\nmentions are the following: _1mo_, The remains of an ancient road are\r\nnow to be seen in the Gulf of Baja at a considerable distance from\r\nthe land. _2do_, Some ancient buildings belonging to Porto Giulio are\r\nat present covered by the sea. _3tio_, Ten columns of granite at the\r\nfoot of Monte Nuovo, which appear to have belonged to the Temple of\r\nthe Nymphs, are also nearly covered by the sea. _4to_, The pavement of\r\nthe Temple of Serapis is now somewhat lower than the high water mark,\r\nthough it cannot be supposed that this edifice when built was exposed\r\nto the inconvenience of having its floor frequently under water. _5to_,\r\nThe ruins of a palace, built by Tiberius in the island of Caprea, are\r\nnow entirely covered by the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: Cap. vi. p. 300.]\r\n\r\nThus, it appears that the level of the sea is sinking in the more\r\nnorthern latitudes, and rising in the Mediterranean, and it is evident\r\nthat this cannot happen by the motion of the sea itself. The parts\r\nof the ocean all communicating with one another, cannot rise in one\r\nplace and fall in another; but, in order to maintain a level surface,\r\nmust rise equally or fall equally over the whole of its extent. If,\r\ntherefore, we place any confidence in the preceding observations, and\r\nthey are certainly liable to no objection, either from their own nature\r\nor the character of the observers, we must consider it as demonstrated,\r\nthat the relative change of level has proceeded from the elevation or\r\ndepression of the land itself. This agrees well with the preceding\r\ntheory, which holds, that our continents are subject to be acted upon\r\nby the expansive forces of the mineral regions; that by these forces\r\nthey have been actually raised up, and are sustained by them in their\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\n399. According to some other facts stated by the same ingenious\r\nauthor, it appears, that on the coast of Italy the progress of the\r\nsea in ascending, or of the land in descending, has not been uniform\r\nduring the period above mentioned, but that different oscillations\r\nhave taken place; so that, from about the beginning of the Christian\r\nera, till some time in the middle ages, the sea rose to be sixteen\r\nfeet higher than at present, from which height it has descended till\r\nit became lower than it is now, and from that state of depression it\r\nis now rising again. Breislac infers this from two facts, which he\r\ncombines very ingeniously with the preceding, viz. the remains of some\r\nancient buildings, at the foot of Monte Nuovo, five or six feet above\r\nthe present level of the sea, in which are found the shells of some\r\nof those little marine animals that eat into stone: And again, the\r\nmarble columns of the temple of Serapis, which are also perforated\r\nby pholades, to the height of sixteen feet above the ground. All\r\nthese changes Breislac ascribes to the motion of the sea itself; a\r\nsupposition which, as we have seen, cannot possibly be admitted, since\r\nnothing can permanently affect the level of the sea in one place, which\r\ndoes not affect it in all places whatsoever.\r\n\r\n400. Appearances, which indicate such alternations as have just been\r\nmentioned in the level of the sea, are to be met with on some other\r\ncoasts. In England, on the coast of Lincolnshire, the remains of a\r\nforest have been observed, which are now entirely covered by the\r\nsea.[207] The submarine stratum which contains the remains of this\r\nforest, can be traced into the country to a great distance, and is\r\nfound throughout all the fens of Lincolnshire. The stratum itself is\r\nabout four feet thick; it is covered in some places by a bed of clay\r\nsixteen feet thick, and under it for twenty feet more is a bed of soft\r\nmud, like the scourings of a ditch, mixed with shells and silt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: Phil. Trans. 1799, p. 145.]\r\n\r\nHere then we have a stratum which must have been once uppermost on the\r\nsurface of the dry land, though one part of it is now immersed under\r\nthe sea, and another covered with earth, to the depth of sixteen feet.\r\nA change of level in the sea itself will not explain these appearances:\r\nthey can only be explained by supposing the whole tract of land to\r\nhave subsided, which is the hypothesis adopted by the author of the\r\ndescription in the Transactions, M. CORRIA DE SERRA; the subsidence,\r\nhowever, is not here understood to arise from the mere yielding of\r\nsome of the strata immediately underneath, but is conceived to be a\r\npart of that geological system of alternate depression and elevation\r\nof the surface, which probably extends to the whole mineral kingdom.\r\nTo reconcile all the different facts, I should be tempted to think,\r\nthat the forest which once covered Lincolnshire, was immersed under the\r\nsea by the subsidence of the land to a great depth, and at a period\r\nconsiderably remote; that when so immersed, it was covered over with\r\nthe bed of clay which now lies on it, by deposition from the sea, and\r\nthe washing down of earth from the land; that it has emerged from this\r\ngreat depth till a part of it has become dry land; but that it is now\r\nsinking again, if the tradition of the country deserves any credit,\r\nthat the part of it in the sea is deeper under water at present than\r\nit was a few years ago. This might also serve to reconcile, in some\r\nmeasure, the phenomena of this submarine forest with the appearances\r\nwhich indicate an extension of the land on the coast of Lincolnshire.\r\nIndeed the extension of the land is no direct proof, either of its own\r\nelevation, or of the depression of the sea, as we may conclude from the\r\ninstance of Ravenna already mentioned.\r\n\r\n401. We have concluded from the facts stated above, that the level of\r\nthe sea rises in the Mediterranean, and sinks in the more northern\r\nlatitudes; and thence some have suspected, that the level of the sea\r\nhad in general a tendency to rise towards the equator, and to sink\r\ntowards the poles. This is the notion of Frisi, as has been already\r\nremarked, and he suggests, that this rise of the sea may be owing to a\r\nslight acceleration in the earth's diurnal motion. But there are facts\r\nwhich show, that between the tropics the relative level of the sea\r\nand land has sunk, and is lower at present than it was at some former\r\nperiod, probably not extremely remote. The opinion of Frisi, therefore,\r\nis unsupported by observation, and, as has been already shown, cannot\r\nbe justified from theory.\r\n\r\nBetween the tropics, islands are formed from the mere accumulation\r\nof coral; and it is the peculiarity of those regions, to produce\r\nrocks that have not passed through the usual process of mineral\r\nconsolidation.[208] The islets, however, which are thus formed, must\r\nhave their bases laid on a solid rock, though perhaps at a great\r\ndepth; and it is not probable, that after they are once raised above\r\nthe surface of the sea, they can still rise farther, except by some\r\nelevation of the rock which serves as their foundation.[209] Now,\r\nat Palmerston island, which comprehends nine or ten low islets, that\r\nmay be reckoned the heads of a great reef of coral rock, Captain\r\nCook informs us of his having seen, \"far beyond the reach of the\r\nsea, even in the most violent storms, elevated coral rocks, which,\r\non examination, appeared to have been perforated in the same manner\r\nthat the rocks are that now compose the outer edge of the reef. This\r\nevidently shows,\" he adds, \"that the sea had formerly reached so far;\r\nand some of these perforated rocks were almost in the centre of the\r\nisland.\"[210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Dr Foster, in his Voyage round the World, (vol. ii. p.\r\n146,) gives an instance in the South Sea Islands, where the surface of\r\nthe island, though entirely a coral rock, was raised forty feet above\r\nthe level of the sea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: A very curious account of the formation of such islands\r\nis given by A. Dalrymple, Esq., in the Philosophical Transitions, vol.\r\nlvii. p. 394.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Cook's Third Voyage, vol i. p. 221.]\r\n\r\nThe same excellent navigator, giving an account of the peninsula at\r\nCape Denbigh, remarks: \"It appeared to me, that this peninsula must\r\nhave been an island in remote times; for there were marks of the sea\r\nhaving flowed over the isthmus.\"\r\n\r\n402. We are here touching on one of those subjects, where we feel much\r\nthe want of accurate and ancient observations, and where it is not from\r\nthe infancy, but the maturity of science that any thing approaching\r\nto certainty can be looked for. The utmost that we can expect at\r\npresent, is an anticipation, which future ages must certainly modify\r\nand correct. The best thing, in the mean time, that can be done for the\r\nadvancement of this branch of geological knowledge, is to ascertain\r\nwith exactness the relative level of the sea, and of such points upon\r\nthe land as can be distinctly marked, and pointed out to succeeding\r\nages. This is not so easy as it may at first appear. Where every object\r\nchanges, it is difficult to find a measure of change, or a fixed point\r\nfrom which the computation may begin. The astronomers already feel\r\nthis inconvenience, and when they would refer their observations to\r\nan immoveable plane, that shall preserve its position the same in all\r\nages, they meet with difficulties, which cannot be removed but by a\r\nprofound mathematical investigation.\r\n\r\nIn geology, we cannot hope to be delivered from this embarrassment in\r\nthe same manner; and we have no resource but to multiply observations\r\nof the difference of level; to make them as exact as possible, and\r\nto select points of comparison that have a chance of being long\r\ndistinguished. The improvements in barometrical measurements, which\r\ngive such facility to the determination of heights, along with so\r\nconsiderable a degree of accuracy, will furnish an accumulation of\r\nfacts that must one day be of great value to the geologist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XXII. § 123.\r\n\r\n                            _Fossil Bones._\r\n\r\n\r\n403. The remains of organized bodies, at present included in the solid\r\nparts of the globe, may be divided into three classes. The first\r\nconsists of the shells, corals,-and even bodies of fish, and amphibious\r\nanimals, which are now converted into stone, and make integrant parts\r\nof the solid rock. All these are parts of animals that existed _before\r\nthe formation of the present land_, or even of the rocks whereof it\r\nconsists. These remains have been already treated of, and the evidence\r\nwhich they furnish must ever be regarded as of the utmost importance\r\nin the theory of the earth. The second class consists of remains,\r\nwhich, by the help of stalactitical concretions, are converted into\r\nstone. These are the exuviæ of animals, which existed on the very same\r\ncontinents on which we now dwell, and are no doubt the most ancient\r\namong their inhabitants, of which any monument is preserved. In\r\ncomparison of the first class, they must, nevertheless, be considered\r\nas of very modern origin.\r\n\r\n404. The third class consists of the bones of animals found in the\r\nloose earth or soil; these have not acquired a stony character, and\r\ntheir nature appears to be but little changed, except by the progress\r\nof decomposition and of mouldering into earth. No decided line can be\r\ndrawn between the antiquity of this and the preceding class, as there\r\nmay be between the preceding and the first. In some instances, the\r\nobjects of this third class may be coeval with those of the second; in\r\ngeneral, they must be accounted of later origin, as they are certainly\r\nnot preserved in a manner so well fitted for long continuance.\r\n\r\n405. The animal remains of the second class, are generally found in\r\nthe neighbourhood of limestone strata, and are either enveloped or\r\npenetrated by calcareous, or sometimes ferruginous matter. Of this\r\nsort are the bones found in the rock of Gibraltar, and on the coast\r\nof Dalmatia. The latter are peculiarly marked for their number, and\r\nthe extent of the country over which they are scattered, leaving it\r\ndoubtful whether they are the work of successive ages, or of some\r\nsudden catastrophe that has assembled in one place, and overwhelmed\r\nwith immediate destruction, a vast multitude of the inhabitants of\r\nthe globe. These remains are found in greatest abundance in the\r\nislands of Cherso and Osero ; end always in what the Abbé FORTIS calls\r\nan _ocreo-stalactitic earth_. The bones are often in the state of\r\nmere splinters, the broken and confused relics of various animals,\r\nconcreted with fragments of marble and lime, in clefts and chasms of\r\nthe strata.[211] Sometimes human bones are said to be found in these\r\nconfused masses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Travels into Dalmatia, p. 449.]\r\n\r\n406. A very remarkable collection of bones in this state is found\r\nin the caves of Bayreuth in Franconia. Many of these belong, as is\r\ninferred with great certainty from the structure of their teeth, to\r\na carnivorous animal of vast size, and having very little affinity\r\nto any of those that are now known. The bones are found in different\r\nstates, some being without any stalactitical concretion, and having\r\nthe calcareous earth still united to the phosphoric acid, so that\r\nthey belong to the third, rather than the second, of the preceding\r\ndivisions. In others, the phosphoric acid has wholly disappeared, and\r\ngiven place to the carbonic.\r\n\r\nThe number of these bones, accumulated in the same place, is matter of\r\nastonishment, when it is considered, that the animals to which they\r\nbelonged were carnivorous, so that more than two can never have lived\r\nin the same cavern at the same time. The caves of Bayreuth seem to have\r\nbeen the den and the tomb of a whole dynasty of unknown monsters, that\r\nissued from this central spot to devour the feebler inhabitants of the\r\nwoods, during a long succession of ages, before man had subdued the\r\nearth, and freed it from all domination but his own.\r\n\r\n407. The fossil bones of the second and third class, but chiefly of the\r\nthird, have now afforded matter of conjecture and discussion for more\r\nthan a century. The facts with respect to them are very numerous and\r\ninteresting, but can be considered here only very generally.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this kind, consist of the bones only of large animals,\r\nso that they have generally been compared with those of the elephant,\r\nthe rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, or other animals of great size The\r\nbones of smaller animals have also been found, but much more rarely\r\nthan the other. It is usually remarked, that the bones thus discovered\r\nin the earth are larger than those of the similar living animals.\r\n\r\nAnother general fact concerning these remains, is, that they are found\r\nin all countries whatsoever, but always in the loose or travelled\r\nearth, and never in the genuine strata. Since the year 1696, when the\r\nattention of the curious was called to this subject, by the skeleton\r\nof an elephant dug up in Thuringia, and described by Tentzelius,[212]\r\nthere is hardly a country in Europe which has not afforded instances\r\nof the same kind. Fossil bones, particularly grinders and tusks of\r\nelephants, have been found in other places of Germany, in Poland,\r\nFrance, Italy, Britain, Ireland, and even Iceland.[213] Two countries,\r\nhowever, afford them in greater abundance by far than any other part of\r\nthe known world; namely, the plains of Siberia in the old continent,\r\nand the flat grounds on the banks of the Ohio in the new.[214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Phil. Trans. vol. xix. p. 757.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: A grinder of an elephant found in Iceland, is described\r\nby _Bartholinus_, Acta Hafniens. vol. i. p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: The fossil bones on the Ohio are described in two papers\r\nby Mr P. Collinson, Phil. Trans. vol. lvii. p. 464 and 468.]\r\n\r\n408. When the bones in Siberia were first discovered, they were\r\nsupposed to belong to an animal that lived under ground, to which\r\nthey gave the name of the _mammouth_; and the credit bestowed on this\r\nabsurd fiction, is a proof of the strong desire which all men feel\r\nof reconciling extraordinary appearances with the regular course of\r\nnature. Much skill, however, in natural history was not required to\r\ndiscover that many of the bones in question resembled those of the\r\nelephant, particularly the grinders and the tusks of that animal.\r\nOthers resembled the bones of the rhinoceros; and a head of that kind,\r\nhaving the hide preserved upon it, was found in Siberia, and is still\r\nin the imperial cabinet at Petersburgh.\r\n\r\nPallas has described the fossil bones which he found in the museum at\r\nPetersburgh, on his being appointed to the superintendence of it, and\r\nenumerates, not only bones that belong, in his opinion, to the elephant\r\nand rhinoceros, but others that belong to a kind of buffalo, very\r\ndifferent from any now known, and of a size vastly greater.[215] He has\r\nalso described, in another very curious memoir, the bones of the same\r\nkind that he met with in his travels through the north-east parts of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Novi Comment Petrop. tom. xiii. (1768,) p. 436, and tom.\r\nxvii. p. 576, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe fossil bones found on the banks of the Ohio, resemble in many\r\nthings those of Siberia; like them they are contained in the soil or\r\nalluvial earth, and never in the solid strata; like them too they are\r\nno otherwise changed from their natural state, than by being sometimes\r\nslightly calcined at the surface; they are also of great size, and in\r\ngreat numbers, being probably the remains of several different species.\r\n\r\n409. Two inquiries concerning these bones have excited the curiosity\r\nof naturalists; first, to discover among the living tribes at present\r\ninhabiting the earth, those to which the fossil remains may with the\r\ngreatest probability be referred; and, secondly, to find out the cause\r\nwhy these remains exist in such quantities, in countries where the\r\nanimals to which they belong, whatever they be, are at present unknown.\r\nThe solution of the first of these questions, is much more within our\r\nreach than the second, and at any rate must be first sought for.\r\n\r\nOn the authority of so eminent a naturalist as Pallas, the bones from\r\nSiberia may safely be referred to the elephant, the rhinoceros, and\r\nbuffalo, as mentioned above, though perhaps to varieties of them with\r\nwhich we are not now acquainted. With respect to the bones of North\r\nAmerica, the question is more doubtful, for they have this particular\r\ncircumstance attending them, viz. that along with the thighbones,\r\ntusks, &c. which might be supposed to belong to the elephant, grinders\r\nare always found of a structure and form entirely different from\r\nthe grinders of that animal.[216] Some naturalists, particularly M.\r\nDAUBENTON, referred these grinders to the hippopotamus; but Dr W.\r\nHUNTER appears to have proved, in a very satisfactory manner, that they\r\ncannot have belonged to either of the animals just mentioned, but to a\r\n_carnivorous_ animal of enormous size, the race of which, fortunately\r\nfor the present inhabitants of the earth, seems now to be entirely\r\nextinct.[217] The foundation of Dr Hunter's opinion is, that in these\r\ngrinders the enamel is merely an external covering; whereas, in the\r\nelephant, and other animals destined to live on vegetable food, the\r\nenamel is intermixed with the substance of the tooth.[218]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: See Mr Collinson's papers, above referred to. Phil.\r\nTrans. vol. lvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Phil. Trans. vol. lviii. p. 3, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: A fossil grinder in the collection of JOHN MACGOWAN,\r\nEsq. of Edinburgh, answers nearly to Mr Collinson's description, and is\r\nvery well represented by the figure which accompanies it. This grinder\r\nweighs four pounds one-fourth avoirdupois; the circumference of the\r\n_corona_ is eighteen inches; the coat of enamel is one-fourth of an\r\ninch thick; there are five double teeth; in Mr Collinson's specimen\r\nthere are only four.]\r\n\r\n410. Though this argument appears to be of considerable weight, yet\r\nCAMPER, who was greatly skilled in comparative anatomy, and who had\r\nstudied this subject with particular attention, was of opinion, that\r\nthese grinders belong to a species of elephant. This opinion he states\r\nin a letter to Pallas, who had found grinders and other bones of this\r\nsame animal, on the western declivity of the Ural mountains.[219]\r\nCamper denies that the animal is carnivorous, because the _incisores_,\r\nor canine teeth, are wanting; and he argues farther, from the weight of\r\nthe head, which may be inferred from the weight of the grinders, that\r\nthe neck must have been short, and the animal must have been furnished\r\nwith a _proboscis_. He afterwards abandoned the latter hypothesis, and\r\ngave it as his opinion that the _incognitum_ was neither carnivorous,\r\nnor a species of the elephant.[220]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Acta Acad. Petrop. tom. i. (1777,) pars posterior, p.\r\n213, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: _Ibid._ tom. ii. (1784,) p. 262.]\r\n\r\n411. Nevertheless, CUVIER, in a _mémoire_ read before the National\r\nInstitute of Paris, maintains, that the fossil bones of the new\r\nContinent, as well as most of those of the old, belong to certain\r\nspecies of the elephant; of which, at least, two do not now exist, and\r\nare only known from remains preserved in the ground. He distinguishes\r\nthem thus:[221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: Mémoires de l'Institut National, Sciences Physiques,\r\ntom. ii. p. 19, &c.]\r\n\r\n_Elephas mammonteus_,--_maxillâ obtusiore, lamellis molarium tenuibus,\r\nrectis_.\r\n\r\n_Elephas Americanus_,--_molarities multicuspidibus, lamellis post\r\ndetritionem quadric-lobatis_.\r\n\r\nThe latter species, which is meant to include the _animal incognitum_,\r\nis said to have lived, not only in America, but in many parts of the\r\nold Continent. Yet some late inquiries into the structure of the teeth\r\nof graminivorous animals, and particularly of the elephant, make it\r\nvery improbable that the _incognitum_ has belonged to this genus.[222]\r\nThe grinders of the elephant have been found to consist of three\r\nsubstances, enamel, bone, and what is called the _crusta petrosa_,\r\napplied in layers, or folds contiguous to one another; and no vestige\r\nof this structure appears in the grinders of the unknown animal of the\r\nOhio.[223] At the same time, Dr Hunter's assertion, that this animal\r\nwas carnivorous, is rendered doubtful, not only by the want of _canine_\r\nteeth, but also from the resemblance between its grinders and those of\r\nthe wild boar, which Mr Home has observed to be considerable.[224] The\r\ngrinder of the boar is similar to that of the elephant, in the extent\r\nof the masticating surface, but not at all in the internal structure;\r\nand the same is true of the tooth of the _animal incognitum_, so that\r\na considerable probability is established, that it and the boar are of\r\nthe same genus, and both destined to live occasionally either on animal\r\nor vegetable food.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: See Mr Home's Observations on the Teeth of Graminivorous\r\nAnimals, Phil. Trans. 1799. Also, an Essay on the Structure of the\r\nTeeth, by Dr Blake.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: In a paper inserted in the fourth volume of the American\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, an account is given of two different\r\ngrinders that are found at the Salt Licks near the Ohio. One of them\r\nresembles the grinder of the elephant, and may have belonged to the\r\n_Elephas Americanus_ of Cuvier; the other agrees pretty nearly with the\r\ngrinder of Dr Hunter's _animal incognitum_. The author of the paper\r\nthinks that the _animal incognitum_ was not wholly carnivorous, as the\r\nincisores, or canine teeth, are never found. At the Great Bone Lick,\r\nbones of smaller animals, particularly of the buffalo kind, have been\r\ndiscovered. The saline impregnation of the earth at these Licks must\r\nno doubt have contributed to the preservation of the bones. Trans.\r\nAmerican Phil. Soc. vol. iv. (1799,) p. 510, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Observations on the Grinding Teeth of the wild boar and\r\n_animal incognitum_. Phil. Trans. 1801, p. 319.]\r\n\r\n412. Another _animal incognitum_ found in South America has been\r\ndescribed by Cuvier, and appears to be of a different genus from the\r\n_incognitum_ of the North. Thus, if we include the two _incognita_ of\r\nAmerica, the _elephas mammonteus_, the unknown buffalo of Pallas, and\r\nthe great animal of Bayreuth, we have at least five distinct genera,\r\nor species of the animal kingdom, which existed on our continents\r\nformerly, but do not exist on them now. The number is probably much\r\ngreater: Pallas mentions fossil horns of a gazelle, of an unknown\r\nspecies; and horns of deer are often found, that cannot be referred to\r\nany species now existing. Those extinct races have been remarkable for\r\ntheir size: some of the ancient elephants appear to have been three\r\ntimes as large as any of the present.[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Camper, Nov. Acta Petrop. tom. ii. (1784) p. 257.]\r\n\r\n413. The inhabitants of the globe, then, like all the other parts of\r\nit, are subject to change. It is not only the individual that perishes,\r\nbut whole _species_, and even perhaps _genera_, are extinguished. It\r\nis not unnatural to consider some part of this change as the operation\r\nof man. The extension of his power would necessary subvert the balance\r\nthat had before been established between the inhabitants of the earth,\r\nand the means of their subsistence. Some of the larger and fiercer\r\nanimals might indeed dispute with him, for a long time, the empire of\r\nthe globe; and it may have required the arm of a Hercules to subdue\r\nthe monsters which lurked in the caves of Bayreuth, or roamed on the\r\nbanks of the Ohio. But these, with others of the same character, were\r\nat length exterminated: the more innocent species fled to a distance\r\nfrom man; and being forced to retire into the most inaccessible parts,\r\nwhere their food was scanty, and their migration checked, they may have\r\ndegenerated from, the size and strength of their ancestors, and some\r\nspecies may have been entirely extinguished.\r\n\r\nBut besides this, a change in the animal kingdom seems to be a part of\r\nthe order of nature, and is visible in instances to which human power\r\ncannot have extended. If we look to the most ancient inhabitants of the\r\nglobe, of which the remains are preserved in the strata themselves,\r\nwe find in the shells and corals of a former world hardly any that\r\nresemble exactly those which exist in the present. The species, except\r\nin a few instances, ate the same, but subject to great varieties. The\r\nvegetable impressions on slate, and other argillaceous stones, can\r\nseldom be exactly recognised; and even the insects included in amber\r\nare different from those of the countries in which the amber is found.\r\n\r\n414. Supposing, then, the changes which have taken place in the\r\nqualities and habits of the animal creation, to be as great as those\r\nin their structure and external form, we can have no reason to wonder\r\nif it should appear that some have formerly dwelt in countries from\r\nwhich the similar races are now entirely banished. The power of living\r\nin a different climate, of enduring greater degrees of cold or of\r\nheat, or of subsisting on different kinds of food, may very well have\r\naccompanied the other changes. Though one species of elephant may\r\nnow be confined to the southern parts of Asia, another may have been\r\nable to endure the severer climates of the north; and the same may\r\nbe true of the buffalo or the rhinoceros. In all this no physical\r\nimpossibility is involved; though whether it is a probable solution of\r\nthe difficulty concerning the origin of these animal remains, can only\r\nbe judged of from other circumstances.\r\n\r\n415. If we consider attentively the facts that respect the Siberian\r\nfossil bones, there will appear insurmountable objections to every\r\ntheory that supposes them to be exotic, and to have been brought into\r\ntheir present situation from a distant country.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the tract through which these bones are scattered, is a\r\ncircumstance truly wonderful. Pallas assures us,[226] that there is not\r\na river of considerable size in all the north of Asia, from the Tanais,\r\nwhich runs into the Black Sea, to the Anadyr, which falls into the Gulf\r\nof Kamtchatka, in the sides or bottom of which bones of elephants and\r\nother large animals have not been found. This is especially the case\r\nwhere the rivers run in plains through gravel, sand, clay, &c.; among\r\nthe mountains, the bones are rarely discovered. The extent of the tract\r\njust mentioned exceeds four thousand miles; and how the bones could\r\nbe distributed over all that extent, by any means but by the animals\r\nhaving lived there, it seems impossible to conceive. No torrent nor\r\ninundation could have produced this effect, nor could the bones brought\r\nin that way have been laid together so as to form complete skeletons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: De Reliquiis Animalium exoticorum, per Asiam Borealem\r\nrepertis.--\"Nov. Comment Petrop. tom. xvii. (1772,) p. 576.]\r\n\r\n416. One fact recorded by the same author, seems calculated to remove\r\nall uncertainty. It is that of the carcase of a rhinoceros, almost\r\nentire, and covered with the hide, found in the earth in the banks of\r\nthe river Wilui, which falls into the Lena below Jakutsk.[227] Some of\r\nthe muscles and tendons were actually adhering to the head when Pallas\r\nreceived it. The head, after being dried in an oven, is still preserved\r\nin the museum at Petersburgh. The preservation of the skin and muscles\r\nof this natural mummy, as Pallas calls it, was no doubt brought\r\nabout by its being buried in earth that was in a state of perpetual\r\ncongelation; for the place is in the parallel of 64°, where the ground\r\nis never thawed but to a very small depth below the surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: Pallas _ubi supra_, p. 586. Also, Voyages de Pallas,\r\ntom. iv. p. 131.]\r\n\r\nBut by what means can we account for the carcase of a rhinoceros being\r\nburied in the earth, on the confines of the polar circle? Shall we\r\nascribe it to some immense torrent, which, sweeping across the deserts\r\nof Tartary, and the mountains of Altai, transported the productions of\r\nIndia to the plains of Siberia, and interred in the mud of the Lena\r\nthe animals that had fed on the banks of the Barampooter or the Ganges?\r\nWere all other objections to so extraordinary a supposition removed,\r\nthe preservation of the hide and muscles of a dead animal, and the\r\nadhesion of the parts, while it was dragged for 2000 miles over some\r\nof the highest and most rugged mountains in the world, is too absurd\r\nto be for a moment admitted. Or shall we suppose that this carcase has\r\nbeen floated in by an inundation of the sea, from some tropical country\r\nnow swallowed up, and of which the numerous islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago are the remains? The heat of a tropical climate, and the\r\nputrescence naturally arising from it, would soon, independently of all\r\nother accidents, have stripped the bones of their covering. Indeed this\r\n_instantia singularis_, as in every sense it may properly be called,\r\nseems calculated for the express purpose of excluding every hypothesis\r\nbut one from being employed to explain the origin of fossil bones.\r\nIt not only excludes the two which have just been mentioned, but it\r\nexcludes also that of Buffon, viz. that these bones are the remains of\r\nanimals which lived in Siberia, when the arctic regions enjoyed a fine\r\nclimate, and a temperature like that which southern Asia now possesses.\r\nFrom the preservation of the flesh and hide of this rhinoceros, it is\r\nplain, that when the body was buried in the earth, the climate was\r\nmuch the same that it is now, and the cold sufficient to resist the\r\nprogress of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nPallas takes notice of the inconsistency of the state of this skeleton,\r\nwith the hypothesis of Buffon; but he does not observe that the\r\ninconsistency is equally great between it and his own hypothesis, the\r\nimportation of the fossil bones by an inundation of the sea, and that\r\nflesh or muscle must have been entirely consumed long before it could\r\nbe carried by the waves to the parallel of 64°, from any climate which\r\nthe rhinoceros at present inhabits.\r\n\r\n417. The presence of petrified marine objects in places where some of\r\nthe fossil bones are found, is no proof that the latter have come from\r\nthe sea, though it is produced as such both by Pallas himself, and\r\nafterwards by Kirwan. These marine bodies are the shells and corals\r\nthat have been parts of calcareous rocks, from which being detached\r\nby the ordinary progress of disintegration, they are now contained in\r\nthe beds of sand or gravel where the animal remains are buried. They\r\nhave nothing in common with these remains; they are real stones, and\r\nbelong to another, and a far more remote epochs. Such objects being\r\nfound in the same place where the bones lie, argues only that the\r\nstrata in the higher grounds, from which the gravel has come, are\r\ncalcareous; and nothing can show in a stronger light the necessity of\r\ndistinguishing the different condition of fossil bodies, united by the\r\nmere circumstance of contiguity, before we draw any inference as to\r\ntheir having a common origin. If the marine remains were in the same\r\ncondition with the bones; if they were in no respect mineralized; then\r\nthe conclusion, that both had been imported by the sea, would have\r\ngreat probability; but without that, their present union must be held\r\nas casual, and can give no insight into the origin of either.\r\n\r\n418. On the whole, therefore, no conclusion remains, but that these\r\nbones have belonged to species of elephants, rhinoceros, &c. which\r\ninhabited the very countries where their remains are now buried, and\r\nwhich could endure the severity of the Siberian climate. The rhinoceros\r\nof the Wilui certainly lived on the confines of the Polar Circle, and\r\nwas exposed to the same cold while alive, by which, when dead, its body\r\nhas been so long, and so curiously preserved.\r\n\r\nThese animals may also have lived occasionally farther to the south,\r\namong the valleys between the great ranges of mountains that bound\r\nSiberia on that side. Fossil bones are but rarely found in these\r\nvalleys, probably because they have been washed down from thence into\r\nthe plains. We must observe, too, that those animals may have migrated\r\nwith the seasons, and by that means avoided the rigorous winter of the\r\nhigh latitudes. The dominion of man, by rendering such migration to\r\nthe larger animals difficult or impossible, must have greatly changed\r\nthe economy of all those tribes, and narrowed the circle of their\r\nenjoyments and existence. The heaps in which the fossil bones appear to\r\nbe accumulated in particular places, especially in North America, have\r\na great appearance of being connected with the migrations of animals,\r\nand the accidents that might bring multitudes of them into the same\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nWhat holds of Siberia and of North America, is applicable, _a\r\nfortiori_, to all the other places where animal remains are found\r\nin the same condition. Thus we are carried back to a time when many\r\nlarger species of animals, now entirely extinct, inhabited the earth,\r\nand when varieties of those that are at present confined to particular\r\nsituations, were, either by the liberty of migration, or by their\r\nnatural constitution, accommodated to all the diversities of climate.\r\nThis period, though beyond the limits of ordinary chronology, is\r\nposterior to the great revolutions on the earth's surface, and the\r\nlatest among geological epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NOTE XXIII. § 128.\r\n\r\n                   _Geology of_ KIRWAN _and_ DE LUC.\r\n\r\n\r\n419. The two champions of the Neptunian system, who have distinguished\r\nthemselves most by their hostility to Dr HUTTON, are DE LUC and KIRWAN.\r\nThey have carried on their attack nearly on the same plan, and have\r\nemployed against their antagonist the weapons both of theology and\r\nscience. With a spirit as injurious to the dignity of religion, as to\r\nthe freedom of philosophical inquiry, they have disregarded a maxim\r\nenforced by the authority of Bacon, and by all our experience of the\r\npast; \"_Tanto magis hæc vanitas inhibenda venit et coërcenda, quia,\r\nex divinorum et humanorum male-sana admixtione, non solum educitur\r\nphilosophia phantastica, sed etiam religio hæretica. Itaque salutare\r\nadmodum est, si mente sobriâ, fidei tantum dentur quæ fidei sunt_.\"[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: The whole passage is deserving of attention, and\r\nit seems as if the prophetic spirit of Bacon had addressed it to\r\nthe cosmologists of the present day. \"_Pessima enim res errorem_\r\nAPOTHEOSIS, _et pro peste intellectús habenda est, si vanis accedat\r\nveneratio. Huic autan vanitati nonnulli ex modernis summâ levitate ita\r\nindulserunt, ut, in primo capitolo_ GENESEOS, _et aliis Scripturis\r\nSacris, philosophiam naturalem fundari conati sunt:_ Inter VIVA\r\nquærentes MORTUA.--\"Nov. Organum, lib. i. aphor. 65]\r\n\r\nProceeding, accordingly, in direct opposition to rules that, have never\r\nyet been violated with impunity, and mistaking the true object of a\r\ntheory of the earth, they carry back their inquiries to a period prior\r\nto the present series of causes and effects, where, having neither\r\nexperience nor analogy to direct them, they pretend to be guided by\r\na superior light. They would have us to consider their geological\r\nspeculations as a commentary on the text of MOSES; they endeavour to\r\nexplain the action of creative power, and, with indiscreet curiosity,\r\nwould tear off the veil which the hand of the prophet has so wisely\r\nrespected. But the veil cannot be torn off, and all that is behind it\r\nmust be to man as that which never has existed.\r\n\r\n420. M. De Luc has nevertheless treated very diffusely of the history\r\nof the solar system, previous to the establishment of the present laws\r\nof nature, and has dwelt on it with great complacency, and singular\r\nminuteness of detail. His tenth letter to LA METHERIE has the following\r\ntitle:\r\n\r\n\"On the History of the Earth, from the time when that planet was\r\npenetrated by _light_, till the appearance of the sun; a portion of\r\ntime which includes the origin of heat, and of the figure of the\r\nearth; of its primeval strata, of the ancient sea, of our continents,\r\nas the bottom of that sea, of the great chains of mountains, and of\r\nvegetation.\"[229]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Journal de Physique, tom. 37. (1790,) partie 2de, p.\r\n332. As I may not have done justice to this extraordinary title, it may\r\nbe right to present it in the original. \"Sur l'Histoire de la TERRE,\r\ndepuis que cette planette fut penetrée de LUMIERE, jusqu'à l'apparition\r\ndu SOLEIL; espace de tems qui renferme les ORIGINES de la _chaleur_,\r\net de la _figure_ de notre globe; de ses _couches primordiales_, de\r\n_l'ancienne mer_, de nos _continens_, comme fond de cette mer, de leurs\r\ngrandes chaînes de _montagnes_, et de la _vegetation_.\"]\r\n\r\nI must confess that I am unacquainted with every thing of this letter\r\nbut the title; and could not easily be prevailed on to follow any man\r\nwho professedly goes out of nature in search of knowledge; who pretends\r\nto give the history of our planetary system when there was no sun,\r\nand to enumerate the events which took place between the existence of\r\nthat luminary, and the existence of light. The absurdity of such an\r\nundertaking admits of no apology; and the smile which it might excite,\r\nif addressed merely to the fancy, gives place to indignation when it\r\nassumes the air of philosophic investigation.\r\n\r\n421. It sets, however, in a strong light, the inconsistencies that\r\nmay be observed in the intellectual character of the same individual,\r\nto consider that the author of this strange and inconsistent\r\nreverie, is, nevertheless, an excellent observer, and well skilled in\r\nexperimental inquiries. It will hardly be believed that he who writes\r\nthe history of the earth before the formation of the sun, is versed\r\nin the principles of inductive reasoning; and that he has added much\r\nto the stock of geological knowledge, having observed accurately, and\r\ndescribed with great perspicuity and candour. His _Lettres Physiques_\r\nare full of valuable and just observations, though accompanied with\r\nreasonings that do not seem always entitled to the same praise; and\r\nin another work he has succeeded where many men of genius had failed,\r\nand has made considerable improvements in a branch of the mathematics,\r\nwithout borrowing almost any assistance from the principles of that\r\nscience.[230]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: Essai sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n422. Some of the same observations apply to Mr Kirwan. His Geological\r\nEssays have also for their object to explain the first origin of\r\nthings; and to say that he has not succeeded, in an attempt where no\r\nman ever can succeed, implies no reproach on the execution of his\r\nwork, whatever it may do on the design. We have indeed no criterion by\r\nwhich the execution of it can be estimated: what would in any other\r\nplace be a blemish, may be here deserving of praise; and if the work\r\nis full of confusion and perplexity, these are qualities inherent in\r\nthe subject which it is intended to describe. It were, no doubt, to\r\nbe wished, that after emerging into the regions of day, Mr Kirwan had\r\nbeen as successful in copying the beauty and simplicity of nature, as\r\nin representing the disorder and inconsistency of the chaotic mass.\r\nBut his cosmology is without unity in its principles, or consistency\r\nin its parts; the causes introduced, are, for the most part, such as\r\nwill account for one set of appearances just as well as for another;\r\nor, if any of them is likely to prove inadequate to the effect ascribed\r\nto it, a new and arbitrary hypothesis is always ready to come to its\r\nassistance. The information given is seldom exact: a multitude of facts\r\nbrought together, without the order and discussion essential to precise\r\nknowledge; and an infinity of quotations, amassed without criticism or\r\ncomparison, afford proofs of extensive reading, but of the most hasty\r\nand superficial inquiry. Thus we have seen passages from ULLOA and\r\nFRISI, produced in support of opinions, which, when fairly stated, they\r\nhad the most direct tendency to overthrow.\r\n\r\n423. In one respect, the geological writings of Kirwan are far inferior\r\nto De Luc's: They are evidently the productions of a man who has not\r\nseen nature with his own eyes; who has studied mineralogy in cabinets,\r\nor in books only; but who has seldom beheld fossils in their native\r\nplace. With the balance in his hand, and the external characters of\r\nWERNER in his view, he has examined minerals with diligence, and has\r\ndiscovered many of those marks which serve to ascertain their places,\r\nin a system of artificial arrangement. But to _reason_ and to _arrange_\r\nare very different occupations of the mind; and a man may deserve\r\npraise as a mineralogist, who is but ill qualified for the researches\r\nof geology.\r\n\r\n424. The same hurry and impatience are visible in the manner in which\r\nhis argument against Dr Hutton is usually conducted. He has seldom been\r\ncareful to make himself master of the opinions of his adversary; and\r\nwhat he gives as such, and directs his reasonings against, have often\r\nno resemblance to them whatsoever. Without any intention to deceive\r\nothers, but deceived himself, he usually begins with misrepresenting Dr\r\nHutton's notions, and then proceeds to the refutation of them. In this\r\nimaginary contest, it will readily be supposed, that he is in general\r\nsuccessful: when a man has the framing both of his own argument, and\r\nthat of his antagonist, he must be a very unskilful logician if he does\r\nnot come off with the advantage.\r\n\r\n425. It is but justice, however, to the Neptunists, to acknowledge,\r\nthat they are not all liable to the censure of beginning their\r\nresearches from a period antecedent to the existence of the laws of\r\nnature. This absurdity does not, so far as I know, infect the system of\r\nWerner. That mineralogist has not proposed to explain the first origin\r\nof things, though he has supposed, at some former period, a condition\r\nof the globe very unlike the present, viz. the entire submersion of the\r\nsolid under the fluid part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XXIV. § 129.\r\n\r\n                          _System of_ BUFFON.\r\n\r\n\r\n426. The affinity of Dr Hutton's theory to that of Buffon, is nothing\r\nmore than what arises from their making use of the same agents, viz.\r\nfire and water, in producing the present condition of the earth's\r\nsurface. In almost all other respects the two theories are extremely\r\ndifferent. The order in which those agents are employed in them, is\r\ndirectly opposite, as has already been remarked; Buffon introducing the\r\naction of fire first, and of water only in the second place, to waste\r\nand destroy mineral bodies, and afterwards to dispose them anew, and\r\narrange them into strata. He makes no provision for the consolidation\r\nof these strata, nor any for their angular elevation; he has no means\r\nof explaining the unstratified rocks; nor any, but one extremely\r\nimperfect, for explaining the inequalities of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nAgain, Buffon mistook, in some degree, the true object of a theory of\r\nthe earth; and though he did not go back, like the geologists just\r\nnamed, to a time when the laws of nature were not fully established,\r\nhe begins from a condition of things too unlike the present to be the\r\nbasis of any rational speculation. He does not, indeed, undertake to\r\nexamine the state of our planetary system before the sun existed; for\r\nfrom such extravagance, even when most disposed to indulge his fancy,\r\nhe would surely have revolted. But he treats of the world, when the\r\nearth and the planets had just ceased to be a part of the sun, and were\r\nnewly detached from the body of that luminary.[231]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: According to Buffon, the granite is the true solar\r\nmatter, unchanged but by its congelation.]\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis concerning the origin of the planets, contrived chiefly\r\nto account for the circumstance of their motion being all in the\r\nsame direction, and in other respects not only unsupported, but even\r\ninconsistent with the principle of gravitation, has nothing in common\r\nwith a theory, confined as Dr Hutton's is, within the field which must\r\nfor ever bound our inquiries, and not venturing to speculate about the\r\nearth, when in a condition totally different from the present.\r\n\r\n427. In what relates to the future, the two systems are not more like\r\nthan in what relates to the past Buffon represents the cooling of our\r\nplanet, and its loss of heat, as a process continually advancing, and\r\nwhich has no limit, but the final extinction of life and motion over\r\nall the surface, and through all the interior, of the earth. The death\r\nof nature herself is the distant but gloomy object that terminates\r\nour view, and reminds us of the wild fictions of the Scandinavian\r\nmythology, according to which, _annihilation_ is at last to extend\r\nits empire even to the gods. This dismal and unphilosophic vision\r\nwas unworthy of the genius of Buffon, and wonderfully ill suited to\r\nthe elegance and extent of his understanding. It forms a complete\r\ncontrast to the theory of Dr Hutton, where nothing is to be seen beyond\r\nthe continuation of the present order; where no latent seed of evil\r\nthreatens final destruction to the whole; and where the movements are\r\nso perfect, that they can never terminate of themselves. This is surely\r\na view of the world more suited to the dignity of NATURE, and the\r\nwisdom of its AUTHOR, than has yet been offered by any other system of\r\ncosmology.\r\n\r\n428. I have often quoted Buffon in, the course of these\r\n_Illustrations_, and most commonly for the purpose of combating his\r\nopinions; but I am very sensible, nevertheless, of the obligations\r\nunder which he has laid all the sciences connected with the natural\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe extent and variety of his knowledge, the justness of his\r\nreasonings, the greatness of his views, his correct taste, and manly\r\neloquence, qualified him, better, perhaps, than any other individual,\r\nto compose the History of Nature. The errors into which he Has fallen,\r\nare almost all the unavoidable consequences of the circumstances in\r\nwhich he was placed; and if their amount is estimated by the proportion\r\nthat they bear to the general excellence of the work, they will be\r\nreckoned but of small account. Buffon began to write when many parts\r\nof natural history had made but little progress; when the quantity\r\nof authentic information was small, and when scientific and correct\r\ndescription was hardly to be found. Many of the greatest and most\r\nimportant facts in geology were quite unknown, and scarcely any part\r\nof the mineral kingdom had been accurately surveyed; and, with such\r\nmaterials as this state of things afforded, it is not wonderful if\r\nsome parts of the edifice he erected have not proved so solid and\r\ndurable as the rest. Had he appeared somewhat later; had he been\r\nfarther removed from the time when reasonings _a priori_ usurped the\r\nplace of induction; and had he been as willing to correct the errors\r\ninto which he had been betrayed by imperfect information, as he was\r\ningenious in defending them, his work would probably have reached as\r\ngreat perfection, as it is given for any thing without the sphere of\r\nthe accurate sciences to attain. If he had examined the natural history\r\nof the earth more with his own eyes, and been as careful to delineate\r\nit with fidelity as force; if he had listened with greater care to\r\nthe philosophers around him; had he attended to the demonstrations of\r\nNEWTON more, and despised the arrangements of LINNÆUS less; he would\r\nhave produced a work, as singular for its truth as for its beauty, and\r\nwould have gone near to merit the eulogy pronounced by the enthusiasm\r\nof his countrymen, MAJESTATI NATURÆ PAR INGENIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XXV. § 130.\r\n\r\n                        _Figure of the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\n429. That the earth is a spheroidal body, compressed at the poles,\r\nor elevated at the equator, is a fact established by many accurate\r\nexperiments; and though these experiments do not exactly coincide, as\r\nto the degree of oblateness which they give to that spheroid, they\r\nagree sufficiently to put it beyond all dispute, that the earth, though\r\nsolid, has nearly the same figure which it would assume if fluid, in\r\nconsequence of its rotation on its axis.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not at all obvious, to what physical cause this phenomenon\r\nis to be ascribed. The earth, as it exists at present, has none of the\r\nconditions that render the assumption of the figure of equilibrium in\r\nany way necessary to it. Constituted as it is, its parts cohere with\r\nforces incomparably too great to obey the laws of statical pressure,\r\nor to assume any one figure rather than another, on account of the\r\ncentrifugal tendency which results from its revolution on its axis.\r\nThere is no necessity that its superficies should be every where level,\r\nor perpendicular to the direction of gravity, nor that every two\r\ncolumns, standing on the same base, any where within it, and reaching\r\nfrom thence to any two points of the surface, should be of such weights\r\nas precisely to balance one another. Neither of these, indeed, is at\r\nall conformable to fact. They are, however, the very suppositions on\r\nwhich the determination of the spheroid of equilibrium is founded; and\r\nas they certainly do in no degree belong to the earth, it seems strange\r\nthat the result deduced from them should be in any way applicable to\r\nit. This coincidence remains, therefore, to be explained; and it must\r\ngreatly enhance the merit of any geological system, if it can connect\r\nthis great and enigmatical phenomenon with the other facts in the\r\nnatural history of the earth.\r\n\r\n430. To establish such a connection, has, accordingly, been a favourite\r\nobject with geologists, whether they have embraced the Neptunian or\r\nVolcanic theory: both have thought that they were entitled to suppose\r\nthe primeval fluidity of the globe, the one by water, and the other\r\nby fire; and in whatsoever way that fluidity was produced, the result\r\nof it could be no other than the spheroidal figure of the whole mass,\r\nagreeably to the laws of hydrostatics. If in this fluid state the earth\r\nwas homogeneous, the spheroid would be accurately elliptical, and the\r\ncompression at the poles would be 1/230 of the radius of the equator;\r\nif the fluid was denser toward the centre, the flattening would be\r\nless: and in either case, the body, as it acquired solidity, may be\r\nsupposed to have retained its spheroidal figure with little variation.\r\nBut though the fluidity of the earth will account for the phenomenon\r\nof its oblate figure, it may reasonably be questioned, whether this\r\nfluidity can be admitted, in consistency with other appearances.\r\nAccording to what is established above, none of the appearances in the\r\nmineral kingdom indicate more than a partial fluidity in any former\r\ncondition of the earth. The present strata, made up as they are of the\r\nruins of former strata, though softened by heat, have not been rendered\r\nfluid by it, and have even possessed their softness in parts, and in\r\nsuccession, not altogether, nor at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe unstratified, and more crystallized substances, were cast in the\r\nbosom of others, which were solid at the time when they were fluid. In\r\nall this, therefore, there is no indication of a fluidity prevailing\r\nthrough the whole mass, or even over the whole surface of the earth,\r\nand therefore nothing that can explain the spheroidal figure which it\r\nhas acquired. The supposition, then, of the entire body of the earth,\r\nor even of its external crust, having been fluid, though it might\r\naccount for the compression at the poles, does not connect that fact\r\nwith the other facts in the natural history of the globe, and fails,\r\ntherefore, in the point most essential to a theory. It is liable, also,\r\nto other objections, whether it be conceived to have proceeded from\r\nfire or from water; whether it has happened on the principles of Buffon\r\nor of Werner.\r\n\r\n431. First, let us suppose that the fluidity of the earth, or of the\r\nexternal crust of it, at least to a certain depth, proceeded from a\r\nsolution of the whole in the waters of the ocean; and, waving all the\r\nobjections that have been stated to this hypothesis, on account of\r\nthe absolute insolubility of many mineral substances in water, let us\r\nsuppose them all soluble in a certain degree, and let us compute the\r\nquantity of the menstruum, which, on the suppositions most favourable\r\nto the system, must have been required to this great geologico-chemical\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous earth, though not soluble in water _per se_, yet, after\r\nbeing dissolved in that fluid by means of an alkali, was found by Dr\r\nBlack, in his analysis of the Geyser water, to remain suspended in a\r\nquantity of water, between 500 and 1000 times its own weight. This is\r\none of the facts most favourable to the Neptunian theory; and that\r\nevery advantage may be given to that theory, we shall take the least of\r\nthe numbers just mentioned, and suppose that siliceous earth may be\r\ndissolved or suspended in 500 times its weight of water.\r\n\r\nTaking this for the extreme degree of insolubility of mineral\r\nsubstances, (though there are many of which the insolubility is\r\nabsolute, or, to speak in the language of calculation, infinitely\r\ngreat,) we may suppose the insolubility of all the rest, or the\r\nquantities of water in which they are dissolved, to be ranged in a\r\ndescending scale from 500 to 0, the extreme degree of deliquescence.\r\nThen, taking the arithmetical mean between these extremes, it will give\r\nus 250, as the proportion of water in which mineral substances may at\r\nan average be dissolved. But this average is much less than the truth;\r\nfor the quantity of siliceous earth is great in comparison of any of\r\nthe rest, and the mineral substances that are extremely soluble in\r\nwater are but in a small quantity; therefore, when we suppose mineral\r\nbodies, at a medium, to be soluble in 250 times their own weight of\r\nwater, we make a supposition extremely favourable to the Neptunian\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n432. This is the proportion between the _weight_ of the solvent, and\r\nof the substances held in solution: to have the proportion of their\r\n_bulks_, we may suppose the specific gravity of mineral bodies in\r\ngeneral to be to that of water as 5 to 2, and then we have the ratio\r\nof bulks, that of 250 × 5 to 2 × 1, or of 625 to 1. It follows, then,\r\nthat minerals in general cannot be supposed soluble in less than 625\r\ntimes their bulk of water.\r\n\r\n433. Again, it must be allowed to the Neptunists, that the fluidity\r\nof the whole earth is not necessary to account for its assuming the\r\nspheroidal figure. It is sufficient if the whole of that crust or shell\r\nof matter was fluid, which is contained between the actual surface\r\nof the terrestrial spheroid, and the surface of the sphere inscribed\r\nwithin it; that is, of the sphere which has for its diameter the polar\r\naxis of the earth. The whole of the minerals which compose this shell,\r\nmust at least have been dissolved in water, and have formed the chaotic\r\nmass of Mr Kirwan. The volume of the water required for this was not\r\nless than 625 times the bulk of the spheroidal shell that has just been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nBut, assuming the difference between the polar axis and the equatorial\r\ndiameter to be 1/300 of the latter, which is the supposition most\r\nagreeable to the phenomena, it is easy to show that the magnitude of\r\nthe above spheroidal shell, or the difference between the solid content\r\nof the earth, and the sphere inscribed in it, is greater than 1/151 and\r\nless than 1/150 of the whole earth; so that the earth is less than 151\r\ntimes the spheroidal shell.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the water, therefore, necessary to hold in solution the\r\nmaterials of this shell, is to the volume of the whole earth as 625\r\nto 151, or in a greater ratio than that of four to one: and such,\r\ntherefore, at the very least, is the quantity of water which Mr Kirwan\r\nsupposes, after it ceased to act in its chemical capacity, to have\r\nretired into caverns in the interior of the earth. Thus the Neptunists,\r\nin their account of the spheroidal figure of the earth, are reduced\r\nto a cruel dilemma, and are forced to choose between a physical and a\r\nmathematical impossibility.\r\n\r\nIf we would inquire whether the opinion of the igneous origin of\r\nminerals, as commonly received by the Vulcanists, is capable of\r\naffording a better solution of this difficulty, the theory of M. de\r\nBuffon is the first that presents itself.\r\n\r\n434. That philosopher considers the existence of the spheroidal figure\r\nas a proof that the whole of the earth must have been originally fluid;\r\nand as the fluidity of the whole can only be ascribed to fusion, he has\r\nsupposed that the earth was originally a mass of melted matter struck\r\noff from the sun by the collision of a comet; and that this mass, when\r\nmade to revolve on its axis, put on a spheroidal figure, which it has\r\nretained, though now cooled down to congelation.\r\n\r\nThis system need not be considered in detail; the foundation of it is\r\nlaid in such defiance of the principles of geometry and mechanics, that\r\nthe architect, notwithstanding all the fertility of his invention, and\r\nall the resources of his genius, was never able to give any solidity to\r\nthe structure.\r\n\r\nBut it will be said, that we may take a part of the system, without\r\nventuring on the whole, and may suppose that the earth, or at least\r\nthe external crust of it, has been fluid by fire, though we do not\r\ninquire into the cause of this fire, or into the manner in which it was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed true, that, when this is done, we have not the same sort\r\nof absurdity to encounter that we met with in the Neptunian system, and\r\nthat the Volcanic theory does not, like it, come into direct collision\r\nwith an axiom of geometry. There are, nevertheless, great objections\r\nto it; for though all the phenomena of the mineral kingdom attest a\r\nfluidity of igneous origin, yet it is a fluidity that was never more\r\nthan partial; and though it has been over all the earth, has been over\r\nit in succession only. Besides, we are not entitled to assume the\r\nexistence, and again the disappearance of such a great quantity of\r\nheat, without assigning some cause for the change.\r\n\r\n435. Since, then, neither the hypothesis of the Neptunists or the\r\nVulcanists, affords any good explanation of the figure of the earth, or\r\nsuch a one as can connect it with the other appearances in its natural\r\nhistory, it remains to inquire, whether the system that supposes a\r\npartial and successive fluidity, like Dr Hutton's, has any resource for\r\nexplaining this great phenomenon.\r\n\r\nOf this subject Dr Hutton has not treated; and when I was first made\r\nacquainted with his system, it appeared to me a very serious objection\r\nto it, that it did not profess to give an explanation of so important\r\na fact as the oblate figure of the earth. On considering the matter\r\nmore closely, however, I found that there were principles contained\r\nin it from which a very satisfactory solution (and, I think, the only\r\nsatisfactory solution) of that difficulty might be deduced. This\r\nsolution I shall endeavour to explain, in as far, at least, as is\r\nnecessary for the purpose of general illustration.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down in Dr Hutton's theory, that the surface of the earth is\r\nperpetually changed by the _detritus_ of the land; and that from the\r\nmaterials thus afforded, new horizontal strata are perpetually formed\r\nat the bottom of the sea. If this be true, and if the alternations of\r\ndecay and renovation have been often repeated, it is certain, that the\r\nfigure of the earth, whatever it may have originally been, must be\r\nbrought at length to coincide with the spheroid of equilibrium.\r\n\r\n436. Here it is necessary to remark, that the expressions, _figure of\r\nthe earth_, and _surface of the earth_ are each of them occasionally\r\ntaken in two different senses.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth, in its most obvious sense, is that which\r\nbounds the whole earth, and includes all its inequalities; it is a\r\nsurface extremely irregular, rising to the tops of the mountains,\r\ndescending to the bottoms of the valleys, and having the continuity\r\nof its curvature often interrupted, or suddenly changed. This may be\r\ncalled the _actual_ surface, and the figure bounded by it, the _actual_\r\nfigure, of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth, in another sense, is one that is every where\r\nhorizontal, and is the same which water assumes when at rest.\r\n\r\nThis superficies is determined by the circumstance of its being\r\nconstantly perpendicular to the direction of gravity; it is the surface\r\nmarked out by levelling, and may be supposed to be continued from the\r\nsea, through the interior of the land, till it meet the sea again. The\r\nfigure bounded by this horizontal surface, may properly be called the\r\n_statical_ figure of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that the figure of the earth is an oblate spheroid, it\r\nis the statical, not the actual figure which is meant; and the degrees\r\nof the meridian which astronomers measure, are also referred to the\r\nsuperficies of the former.\r\n\r\n437. Suppose now a body like the earth, but with its actual figure\r\ninfinitely more irregular, having a sea circumfused around it, the\r\nwater will descend into the lowest situations, and will so arrange\r\nitself, that its surface shall be perpendicular every where to the\r\nplumb-line, or to the direction of gravity, in which state only it can\r\nremain at rest. The figure of the superficies which the sea must thus\r\ntake will be of a continuous curvature, and will return into itself;\r\nthough it may, if the actual figure is very irregular, be far either\r\nfrom a sphere or a spheroid. If, however, we suppose the solid parts\r\nof this mass subject to be dissolved or worn away, and carried down to\r\nthe ocean, there will be a tendency to give to the whole body the same\r\nfigure that it would have assumed, if it had been entirely fluid, and\r\nsubject to the laws of hydrostatics. This tendency is the result of\r\ntwo principles.\r\n\r\n438. Let us suppose the body just described to have no rotation, so\r\nthat the particles of it are actuated only by the forces of cohesion\r\nand of attraction.\r\n\r\nIt is then clear, that every particle taken away by attrition from the\r\nparts above the level of the sea, and deposited under the surface of\r\nit, makes the general figure more compact, bringing the remoter parts\r\nnearer to the centre of gravity of the whole; so that, in time, if the\r\nbody is homogeneous, all the points of the surface will become equally\r\ndistant from that centre. Thus the _actual_ figure changes continually,\r\nand approaches nearer to the _statical_.\r\n\r\nWhile this change is going forward in the actual figure, there is\r\nanother produced on the statical, that tends very much to accelerate\r\nthe final coincidence, of the two.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the inequalities of the land, that rise above the\r\nhorizontal surface, is, by their attraction, to render the parts of\r\nthat surface immediately under them, more convex, _cæteris paribus_,\r\nthan the rest. Again, where there are parts of extraordinary depth in\r\nthe sea, that is, where the solid and denser parts are far removed from\r\nthe surface of the ocean, the curvature of the superficies of the sea\r\nis thereby diminished, and that superficies is rendered less convex\r\nthan it would be if the sea were shallower. These propositions are both\r\ncapable of strict mathematical demonstration. Hence the taking away of\r\nany particle of matter from the top of a mountain tends to diminish the\r\ncurvature of the horizontal surface under the mountain, where it is\r\ngreatest; and the deposition of the same particle at the bottom of the\r\nsea, tends to increase the curvature of this superficies where it is\r\nleast. The general tendency, therefore, being to increase the curvature\r\nwhere it is least, and to diminish it where it is greatest, must be\r\nto bring about an uniform curvature throughout, that is, a spherical\r\nfigure. Thus, by the waste and subsequent stratification of the land,\r\nthe direction of gravity is continually altered; it is more and more\r\nconcentrated, and the figure brought nearer to that which a fluid would\r\nassume.\r\n\r\n439. If now we suppose the body to revolve on its axis, all other\r\nthings remaining as before, the surface bounding the sea will become\r\ndifferent from what it was in the former case, and will be more swelled\r\nout toward the middle or equatorial regions. The land above the level\r\nof the sea will still, as before, be worn down and deposited in the\r\nbottom of the sea, so as to form strata nearly parallel to its surface:\r\nthe tendency, therefore, is to render the real figure of the planet\r\nnearer to the statical. At the same time the _statical_ figure is\r\nchanged, as explained above; so that the two figures mutually approach,\r\nand the limit, or ultimate figure to which they tend, is one over which\r\nthe ocean might be diffused every where to the same depth, for then the\r\ncauses of change would entirely cease. But this figure is no other than\r\nthe spheroid of equilibrium, which, therefore, is the effect which the\r\nwaste and reconsolidation of the land would necessarily produce, if the\r\nprocess were continued indefinitely, without interruption. In this, as\r\nin many other instances, when a body is subject to the action of causes\r\nby which its form is _gradually_ changed, the figure best adapted\r\nto resist those changes, is the figure which the changes themselves\r\nultimately produce.\r\n\r\nAlso, whatever be the irregularities of density, the tendency to a\r\nchange of figure will not cease till the body is moulded into that\r\nparticular spheroid which admits of being covered with water every\r\nwhere to the same depth.[232] Thus it appears, that a solid of an\r\nirregular figure, and of irregular density, provided it be in part\r\ncovered with water; and be at the same time subject to waste above the\r\nsurface of the sea, and reconsolidation under it, has a tendency to\r\nacquire, in time, the same figure that it would have acquired had it\r\nbeen entirely fluid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: In the same manner as a transition is thus made from an\r\nirregular figure to a spheroid of equilibrium, so, if the actual figure\r\nwere at first more simple than the spheroid, it would still be changed\r\ninto this last by degrees.\r\n\r\nLet us conceive, for instance, that the earth is at rest, and is a\r\nperfect sphere of solid matter, surrounded by an ocean every where of\r\nequal depth, for example, of one mile. Then, if a rotatory motion be\r\ncommunicated to it, so that it shall revolve on its axis in twenty-four\r\nhours, in consequence of the centrifugal force, the water circumfused\r\nabout the sphere will immediately rise up under the equator, and will\r\nbecome part of a spheroidal surface, (not elliptical, but nearly so,)\r\nthe equatorial diameter of which is greater than the polar axis, in the\r\nratio of 588 to 577 By this means the water will be accumulated at the\r\nequator to the depth of nearly 2.5 miles, and form a zone surrounding\r\nthe earth, and extending about 37° on each side of the equator. The\r\nremainder of the surface will be left dry, forming two vast circumpolar\r\ncontinents, that reach 53° on every side of the poles, and that are\r\nelevated in the middle more than four miles above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nSuch would be the state of our globe, on the hypothesis above laid\r\ndown; and, if there were no waste or destruction of the land, this\r\norder of things would be permanent, and neither the solid nor fluid\r\npart of the mass could ever acquire any other figure than that which\r\nhas been described. But, if the same laws be supposed to regulate the\r\naction of the atmosphere in those circumstances, that do actually\r\nregulate it according to the present constitution of the globe, the\r\nvapours raised up from the surface of the sea, would be carried by the\r\nwinds over the land, where they would be condensed and precipitated in\r\nrain. Thus, all the agents of destruction would be let loose on the two\r\ngreat circumpolar continents; rivers would be formed; the land would\r\nbecome deeply intersected by ravines; those ravines would gradually\r\nopen into wide valleys; the masses of greatest resistance would be\r\nshaped into hills and mountains: and from a superficies originally\r\nsmooth and uniform, the same inequalities would be produced which at\r\npresent diversify the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhile the parts of the sphere without the spheroid are thus continually\r\ndiminished, the loose earth and sand washed down from them, will be\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the sea, and will form strata parallel\r\nto the surface of the superincumbent water. The actual and statical\r\nfigure are thus brought nearer one another; and, at the same time the\r\nstatical is changed, on the principle already explained, (the change in\r\nthe direction of gravity,) and is made continually to approximate to a\r\nstate, which when it has attained, no farther change can take place,\r\nviz. an oblate elliptic spheroid, of which the surface is perpendicular\r\nto the direction of gravity, having the equatorial diameter to the\r\npolar axis in the ratio of 230 to 229.]\r\n\r\n440. In the preceding reasonings, we have supposed the process of decay\r\nand subsequent stratification to be carried on without interruption,\r\ntill the whole of the land is covered by the sea. This supposition is\r\nuseful for explaining the nature of the forces which have determined\r\nthe figure of the earth; but there is no reason to think that it has\r\never been realized in its full extent, the elevation of strata from the\r\nbottom of the sea interrupting the progress, and producing new land\r\nin one place, as the old decays in another. The very same land also,\r\nwhich is wasted at its surface, may perhaps be lifted up by the forces\r\nthat are placed under it; or it may be let down, undergoing alterations\r\nof its level, from causes that we do not perceive, but of which the\r\naction is undoubted, (§ 388.) But notwithstanding these interruptions,\r\nthe general tendency to produce in the earth a spheroidal figure may\r\nremain, and more may be done by every revolution, to bring about the\r\nattainment of that figure than to cause a deviation from it. This\r\nfigure, therefore, though never likely to be perfectly acquired, will\r\nbe the _limiting_ or _asymptotic_ figure, if it may be so called, to\r\nwhich the earth will continually approach.\r\n\r\n441. If the preceding conclusions are just, and if the figure of\r\nequilibrium is only an asymptotic figure, to which that of the earth\r\nmay approximate, but cannot perfectly attain, we are not to be\r\nsurprised if considerable deviations from it are actually observed.\r\nThis has accordingly happened, insomuch, that the results deduced from\r\nthe most accurate measurement of degrees of the meridian, differ from\r\none another, in the oblateness they give to the earth, by nearly one\r\nhalf of the quantity to be determined. When we compare the degrees\r\nmeasured in France, and in some other countries of Europe, with\r\nthose measured in Peru, we obtain for the compression at the poles,\r\nless than 1/300 of the radius of the earth. But when we compare the\r\ndegrees measured in France with one another, and with those lately\r\nmeasured in England, we find that they are best represented by a\r\nspheroid that has its compression 1/150 of its semi-axis.[233] There\r\nis reason to think, therefore, that the meridians are not elliptical;\r\nand other observations seem to show, that they are not even similar\r\nto one another; or that the earth is not, strictly speaking, a solid\r\nof revolution; so, also, the comparison of the degree measured at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, with those measured on the opposite side of\r\nthe equator, creates a suspicion, that the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres are not perfectly alike, and that the earth is not equally\r\ncompressed at the Arctic and the Antarctic poles. These irregularities,\r\nthough they do not affect the general fact of the earth's compression\r\nat the poles, show that the true statical figure is but imperfectly\r\nattained; and though this may be accounted for, without having recourse\r\nto the principles involved in our theory, it is in a manner very\r\nunsatisfactory, and, by help of suppositions, not at all consistent\r\nwith the original fluidity ascribed to the whole mass, or to the\r\nexterior crust of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Exposition du Systéme du Monde, par La Place, p. 61, 2d\r\nedit.]\r\n\r\n442. As the principles here laid down explain how a solid body may\r\nattain very nearly the figure which a fluid would acquire in order to\r\npreserve its parts in equilibrium; and since the oblate figure belongs\r\nto other of the planets as well as the earth, and the globular to all\r\nthe great bodies of the universe, this suggests an analogy that goes\r\ndeep into the economy of nature, and extends far beyond the limits\r\nwithin which the mineralogist is wont to confine his speculations.\r\n\r\n443. That no very irregular figure is found among the planetary bodies,\r\nmay therefore be considered as a proof of the universality of that\r\nsystem of waste and reconsolidation that we have been endeavouring to\r\ntrace in the natural history of the earth. A farther proof of the same\r\narises from considering, that for every given mass of matter, having a\r\ngiven period of rotation, there are two different spheroids that answer\r\nthe conditions of establishing an equilibrium among its parts, the one\r\nnear to the sphere, and the other very distant from it, and so oblate\r\nas to have a lenticular form. Thus the earth, supposing it homogeneous,\r\nmight either be in equilibrium, by means of the figure which it\r\nactually has, or of one in which the polar was to the equatorial\r\ndiameter as 1 to 768. The same is true of the other planets; and yet we\r\nno where find that this highly compressed spheroid is actually employed\r\nby nature. The reason, no doubt, is, that in so oblate a spheroid, the\r\nequilibrium between the gravitating and the centrifugal force is of\r\nthe kind that does not re-establish itself when disturbed; so that the\r\nparts let loose, and not kept in their place by firm cohesion, would\r\nfly off altogether. In such a body, the waste at the surface would\r\nlead to an entire change of form, and therefore the constitution here\r\nsupposed could not be permanent.\r\n\r\n444. In the system of Saturn, we have a great deviation from the\r\ngeneral order, which, nevertheless, has led to a very unexpected\r\nverification of some of the conclusions deduced above. A principle\r\nextremely like that which is the basis of all the foregoing reasonings,\r\nled one of the greatest philosophers of the present age to discover\r\nthe revolution of Saturn's ring on its axis, and even to determine\r\nthe velocity of that revolution, such as it has been since found by\r\nobservation. LA PLACE, laying it down as a maxim, that nothing in\r\nnature can exist, where there are causes of change, not balanced or\r\ncompensated by other causes,[234] concluded, that the-parts of the\r\nring must be held from falling down to the body of the planet by some\r\nother force than their mere cohesion to one another. Were it otherwise,\r\nevery particle detached from the ring, by any means, must descend in a\r\nstraight line, almost perpendicular to the surface of Saturn; and the\r\nfinal destruction of the ring must be inevitable. The only force that\r\ncould balance this effect of gravitation, seemed to be a centrifugal\r\nforce, arising from the rotation of the ring on an axis passing through\r\nits centre, and perpendicular to its plane. La Place proceeded to\r\ninquire what celerity of rotation was adequate to this effect, and\r\nfound that one of ten hours and a quarter would be required, which\r\nis almost precisely the time afterwards determined by Dr HERSCHEL\r\nfrom actual observation. If, with this rotation, the ring is a solid\r\nannulus generated by the rotation of a very flat ellipsis about a given\r\npoint in its greater axis, coinciding with the centre of Saturn, it may\r\nbe so constituted, that the attraction of Saturn, combined with the\r\ncentrifugal force, may produce a force perpendicular to its surface,\r\nand may enable detached parts to remain at rest, animals, for instance,\r\nto walk on its surface, and fluids to be _in equilibrio_. The system of\r\nSaturn is thus fortified against the lapse of time, as effectually as\r\nthat of the earth itself; and the means by which this is accomplished,\r\nseem to prove, that the weapons which time employs, are in both cases\r\nthe same, viz. the slow wearing and decomposition of the solid parts.\r\nThis slow wearing may have produced the figure by which its action is\r\nmost effectually resisted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: La Place, _ubi supra_, p. 242.]\r\n\r\n445. Thus Dr Hutton's theory of the earth comes at last to connect\r\nitself with the researches of physical astronomy. The conclusion to be\r\ndrawn from this coincidence is to the credit of both sciences. When two\r\ntravellers, who set out from points so distant as the mineralogist and\r\nthe astronomer, and who follow routes so different, meet at the end of\r\ntheir journey, and agree in their report of the countries through which\r\nthey have passed, it affords no slight presumption, that they have kept\r\nthe right way, and that they relate what they have actually seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE XXVI. § 133.\r\n\r\n                        _Prejudices relating to\r\n                         the Theory of the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\n446. Among the prejudices which a new theory of the earth has to\r\novercome, is an opinion, held, or affected to be held, by many, that\r\ngeological science is not yet ripe for such elevated and difficult\r\nspeculations. They would, therefore, get rid of these speculations, _by\r\nmoving the previous question_, and declaring that at present we ought\r\nto have no theory at all. We are not yet, they allege, sufficiently\r\nacquainted with the phenomena of geology; the subject is so various and\r\nextensive that our knowledge of it must for a long time, perhaps for\r\never, remain extremely imperfect. And hence it is, that the theories\r\nhitherto proposed have succeeded one another with so great rapidity,\r\nhardly any of them having been able to last longer than the discovery\r\nof a new fact, or a fact unknown when it was invented. It has proved\r\ninsufficient to connect this fact with the phenomena already known, and\r\nhas therefore been justly abandoned. In this manner, they say, have\r\npassed away the theories of Woodward, Burnet, Whiston, and even of\r\nBuffon; and so will pass, in their turn, those of Hutton and Werner.\r\n\r\n447. This unfavourable view of geology, ought not, however, to be\r\nreceived without examination; in science, presumption is less hurtful\r\nthan despair, and inactivity is more dangerous than error.\r\n\r\nOne reason of the rapid succession of geological theories, is the\r\nmistake that has been made as to their object, and the folly of\r\nattempting to explain by them the first origin of things. This mistake\r\nhas led to fanciful speculations that had nothing but their novelty to\r\nrecommend them, and which, when that charm had ceased, were rejected\r\nas mere suppositions, incapable of proof. But if it is once settled,\r\nthat a theory of the earth ought to have no other aim but to discover\r\nthe laws that regulate the changes on the surface, or in the interior\r\nof the globe, the subject is brought within the sphere either of\r\nobservation or analogy; and there is no reason to suppose, that man,\r\nwho has numbered the stars, and measured their forces, shall ultimately\r\nprove unequal to this investigation.\r\n\r\n448. Again, theories that have a rational object, though they be false\r\nor imperfect in their principles, are for the most part approximations\r\nto the truth, suited to the information at the time when they were\r\nproposed. They are steps, therefore, in the advancement of knowledge,\r\nand are terms of a series that must end when the real laws of nature\r\nare discovered. It is, on this account, rash to conclude, that in the\r\nrevolutions of science, what has happened must continue to happen,\r\nand because systems have changed rapidly in time past, that they must\r\nnecessarily do so in time to come.\r\n\r\nHe who would have reasoned so, and who had seen the ancient physical\r\nsystems, at first all rivals to one another, and then swallowed up by\r\nthe Aristotelian; the Aristotelian physics giving way to those of Des\r\nCartes; and the physics of Des Cartes to those of Newton; would have\r\npredicted that these last were also, in their turn, to give place to\r\nthe philosophy of some later period. This is, however, a conclusion\r\nthat hardly any one will now be bold enough to maintain, after a\r\nhundred years of the most scrupulous examination have done nothing\r\nbut add to the evidence of the NEWTONIAN SYSTEM. It seems certain,\r\ntherefore, that the rise and fall of theories in times past, does not\r\nargue, that the same will happen in the time that is to come.\r\n\r\n449. The multifarious and extremely diversified object of geological\r\nresearches, does, no doubt, render the first steps difficult, and\r\nmay very well account for the instability hitherto observed in such\r\ntheories; but the very same thing gives reason for expecting a very\r\nhigh degree of certainty to be ultimately attained in these inquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the phenomena are few and simple, there may be several different\r\ntheories that will explain them in a manner equally satisfactory;\r\nand in such cases, the true and the false hypotheses are not easily\r\ndistinguished from one another. When, on the other hand, the phenomena\r\nare greatly varied, the probability is, that among them, some of\r\nthose _instantiæ crucis_ will be found, that exclude every hypothesis\r\nbut one, and reduce the explanation given to the highest degree of\r\ncertainty. It was thus, when the phenomena of the heavens were but\r\nimperfectly known, and were confined to a few general and simple facts,\r\nthat the Philolaic could claim no preference to the Ptolemaic system:\r\nThe former seemed a possible hypothesis; but as it performed nothing\r\nthat the other did not perform, and was inconsistent with some of our\r\nmost natural prejudices, it had but few adherents. The invention of the\r\ntelescope, and the use of more accurate instruments, by multiplying\r\nand diversifying the facts, established its credit; and when not only\r\nthe general laws, but also the inequalities, and disturbances of the\r\nplanetary motions were understood, all physical hypotheses vanished,\r\nlike phantoms, before the philosophy of NEWTON. Hence the number, the\r\nvariety, and even the complication of facts, contribute ultimately to\r\nseparate truth from falsehood; and the same causes which, in any case,\r\nrender the first attempts toward a theory difficult, make the final\r\nsuccess of such attempts just so much the more probable.\r\n\r\nThis maxim, however, though a general encouragement to the prosecution\r\nof geological inquiries, does not amount to a proof that we are yet\r\narrived at the period when those inquiries may safely assume the form\r\nof a theory. But that we are arrived at such a period, appears clear\r\nfrom other circumstances.\r\n\r\n450. It cannot be denied, that a great multitude of facts, respecting\r\nthe mineral kingdom, are now known with considerable precision; and\r\nthat the many diligent and skilful observers, who have arisen in the\r\ncourse of the last thirty years, have produced a great change in the\r\nstate of geological knowledge. It is unnecessary to enumerate them\r\nall; FERBER, BERGMAN, DE LUC, SAUSSURE, DOLOMIEU, are those on whom\r\nDr Hutton chiefly relied; and it is on their observations and his own\r\nthat his system is founded. If it be said, that only a small part of\r\nthe earth's surface has yet been surveyed, and described with such\r\naccuracy as is found in the writers just named, it may be answered,\r\nthat the earth is constructed with such a degree of uniformity, that a\r\ntract of no very large extent may afford instances of all the leading\r\nfacts that we can ever observe in the mineral kingdom. The variety of\r\ngeological appearances which a traveller meets with, is not at all in\r\nproportion to the extent of country he traverses; and if he take in a\r\nportion of land sufficient to include primitive and secondary strata,\r\ntogether with mountains, rivers, and plains, and unstratified bodies in\r\nveins and in masses, though it be not a very large part of the earth's\r\nsurface, he may find examples of all the most important facts in the\r\nhistory of fossils. Though the labours of mineralogists have embraced\r\nbut a small part of the globe, they may therefore have comprehended a\r\nvery large proportion of the phenomena which it exhibits; and hence a\r\npresumption arises, that the outlines, at least, of geology have now\r\nbeen traced with tolerable truth, and are not susceptible of great\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n451. When the phenomena of any class are in general ambiguous, and\r\nadmit of being explained by different or even opposite theories; if few\r\nof those exclusive facts are known, which admit but of one or a few\r\nsolutions, then we have no right to expect much from our endeavours to\r\ngeneralise, except the knowledge of the points where our information\r\nis most deficient, and to which our observations ought chiefly to be\r\ndirected. But that many of the exclusive and unambiguous instances are\r\nknown, in the natural history of the globe, I think is evident from the\r\nreasoning in the foregoing pages, where so many examples have occurred\r\nof appearances that give the most direct negative to the Neptunian\r\nsystem, and exclude it from the number of possible hypotheses, by\r\nwhich the phenomena of geology can be explained. The abundance of such\r\ninstances is an infallible sign, that the mass of knowledge is in that\r\nstate of fermentation, from which the true theory may be expected to\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\n452. Another indication of the same kind, is the near approach that\r\neven the most opposite theories make, in some respects, to one another.\r\nThere are so many points of contact between them, that they appear\r\nto approximate to an ultimate state, in which, however unwillingly,\r\nthey must at last coincide. That ultimate form, too, which all these\r\ntheories have a tendency to put on, if I am not deceived, is no other\r\nthan that of the Huttonian theory.\r\n\r\n453. The first example I shall take from the system of Saussure. It\r\nis to be regretted, that this excellent geologist has no where given\r\nus a complete account of his theory. Some of the leading principles\r\nof it are, however, unfolded in the course of his observations, and\r\nenable us to form a notion of its general outline. It was evidently far\r\nremoved from the system of subterraneous heat, and seems, especially\r\nin the latter part of the author's life, to have been very much\r\naccommodated to the prevailing system of WERNER. Nevertheless, with\r\nso little affinity between their general views, Saussure and Hutton\r\nagree in that most important article which regards the elevation of\r\nthe strata. Saussure plainly perceived the impossibility of the strata\r\nbeing formed in the vertical situations which so many of them now\r\noccupy; and he takes great pains to demonstrate this impossibility,\r\nfrom some facts that have been referred to above. He also believed that\r\nthis elevation had been given to strata that were originally level, by\r\na force directed upwards, or by the _refoulement_ of the beds, not by\r\ntheir falling in, as is the opinion of De Luc and some other of the\r\nNeptunists.\r\n\r\nNow, whoever admits this principle, and reasons on it consistently,\r\nwithout being afraid to follow it through all its consequences, must\r\nunavoidably come very close to the Huttonian theory. He must see,\r\nthat a power which, acting from below, produced this great effect\r\ncan never have belonged to water, unless rarefied into steam by the\r\napplication of heat. But if it be once admitted that heat resides in\r\nthe mineral regions, the great objection to Dr Hutton's system is\r\nremoved; and the theorist, who was furnished with so active and so\r\npowerful an agent, would be very unskilful in the management of his\r\nown resources, if he did not employ it in the work of consolidating as\r\nwell as in that of raising up the strata. A little attention will show,\r\nthat it is qualified for both purposes; though insuperable objections\r\nmust, no doubt, offer themselves, where the effects of compression\r\nare not understood. We may safely conclude, then, that the accurate\r\nand ingenious Geologist of Geneva ought to have been a _Plutonist_,\r\nin order to give consistency to the principles which he had adopted,\r\nand to make them coalesce as parts of one and the same system. If he\r\nembraced an opposite opinion, it probably was from feeling the force of\r\nthose objections that arise from our discovering nothing in the bowels\r\nof the earth like the remains left by combustion, or inflammation, at\r\nits surface. The secret by which these seeming contradictions are to be\r\nreconciled, was unknown to this mineralogist, and he has accordingly\r\ndecided strongly against the action of fire, even in the case of those\r\nunstratified substances that have the greatest affinity to volcanic\r\nlava.\r\n\r\n454. The theoretical conclusions of another accurate and skilful\r\nobserver, Dolomieu, furnish a still more remarkable example of a\r\ntendency to union between systems professedly hostile to one another.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious mineralogist, observing the interposition of the basalt\r\nbetween stratified rocks, so that it had not only regular beds of\r\nsandstone for its base, but was also covered with beds of the same\r\nkind, saw plainly that these appearances were inconsistent with the\r\nsupposition of common volcanic explosions at the surface. He therefore\r\nconceived, that the volcanic eruption had happened at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, (the level of which, in former ages, had been much higher\r\nthan at present,) and that the materials afterwards deposited on the\r\nlava, had been in length of time consolidated into beds of stone. It\r\nis evident, that this notion of submarine volcanoes, comes very near,\r\nin many respects, to Dr Hutton's explanation of the same appearances.\r\nIf the only thing to be accounted for were the phenomenon in question,\r\nit cannot be denied that Dolomieu's hypothesis would be perfectly\r\nsufficient; but Dr Hutton, to whom this phenomenon was familiar, and\r\nwho, like Dolomieu, conceived the basalt to have been in fusion, was\r\nconvinced that the retreat of the sea was not a fact well attested by\r\ngeological appearances, and if admitted, was inadequate to account for\r\nthe facts usually explained by it. He conceived, therefore, that such\r\nlava as the preceding had flowed not only at the bottom of the sea,\r\nbut in the bowels of the earth, and having been forced up through the\r\nfissures of rocks already formed, had heaved up some of these rocks,\r\nand interposed itself between them. This agrees with the other facts in\r\nthe natural history both of the basaltes and the strata.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, that, in this, there is a great approach of the two\r\ntheories to one another: both maintain the igneous origin of basaltes,\r\nand its affinity to lava; both acknowledge that this lava cannot have\r\nflowed at the surface, and that the strata which cover it have been\r\nformed at the bottom of the sea. They only differ as to the mode in\r\nwhich the submarine or subterraneous volcano produced its effect, and\r\nthat difference arises merely from the one geologist having generalized\r\nmore than the other. Dolomieu sought to connect the basalt with the\r\nlavas that proceed from volcanic explosions at the surface; Dr Hutton\r\nsought not only to connect these two appearances with one another, but\r\nalso with the other phenomena of mineralogy, particularly with the\r\nveins of basaltes, and the elevation of the strata.\r\n\r\n455. In another point, the coincidence of Dolomieu's opinions and Dr\r\nHutton's is still more striking. The former has remarked, that many\r\nof the extinguished volcanoes are in granite countries, and that,\r\nnevertheless, the lavas that they have erupted contain no granitic\r\nstones. There must be, therefore, says he, something under the granite,\r\nand this last is not, at least in all cases, to be considered as the\r\nbasis of the mineral kingdom, or as the body on which all others rest.\r\nIn this system, therefore, granite is not always a primordial rock, any\r\nmore than in Dr Hutton's.\r\n\r\nBut Dolomieu makes a still nearer advance to the Huttonian theory; for\r\nhe supposes, that under the solid and hard crust of the globe, there is\r\na sphere of melted stone, from which this basaltic lava was thrown up.\r\nThe system of subterraneous heat is here adopted in its utmost extent,\r\nand in that form which is considered as the most liable to objection,\r\nviz. the existence of it at the present moment, in such a degree as to\r\nmelt rocks, and keep them in a state of fusion. In this conclusion, the\r\ntwo theories agree perfectly; and if they do so, it is only because\r\nthe nature of things has forced them into union, notwithstanding the\r\ndissimilitude of their fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nThis ought to be considered as a strong proof, that the phenomena\r\nknown to mineralogists are sufficient to justify the attempts to form\r\na theory of the earth, and are such as lead to the same conclusions,\r\nwhere there was not only no previous concert, but even a very marked\r\nopposition. I have already observed, that there is a greater tendency\r\nto agree among geological theories, than among the authors of those\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\n456. Another circumstance worthy of consideration is, that in the\r\nsearch which the Neptunists have made, for facts most favourable to the\r\naqueous formation of minerals, we find hardly any of a kind that was\r\nunknown to the author of the system here explained. The appearances on\r\nwhich WERNER grounds his opinion with respect to basaltes, and by which\r\nhe would exclude the action of fire from any share in the formation of\r\nit, are all comprehended in the alternation of that rock with beds, or\r\nstrata obviously of aqueous origin. Now these appearances were well\r\nknown to Dr Hutton, and are easily explained by his theory, provided\r\nthe effects of compression are admitted. From this, and the other\r\ncircumstances just observed, I am disposed to think, that the great\r\nfacts on which every geological system must depend, are now known, and\r\nthat it is not too bold an anticipation to say, that a theory of the\r\nearth, which explains all the phenomena with which we are at present\r\nacquainted, will be found to explain all those that remain to be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n457. The time indeed was, and we are not yet far removed from it,\r\nwhen one of the most important principles involved in Dr Hutton's\r\ntheory was not only unknown, but could not be discovered. This was\r\nbefore the causticity produced in limestone by exposure to fire was\r\nunderstood, and when it was not known that it arose from the expulsion\r\nof a certain aerial fluid, which before was a component part of the\r\nstone. It could not then be perceived, that this aerial part might be\r\nretained by pressure, even in spite of the action of fire, and that in\r\na region where great compression existed, the absence of causticity was\r\nno proof that great heat had not been applied. The discoveries of Dr\r\nBLACK, therefore, mark an era, before which men were not qualified to\r\njudge of the nature of the powers that had acted in the consolidation\r\nof mineral substances. Those discoveries were, indeed, destined to\r\nproduce a memorable change in chemistry, and in all the branches of\r\nknowledge allied to it; and have been the foundation of that brilliant\r\nprogress, by which a collection of practical rules, and of insulated\r\nfacts, has in a few years risen to the rank of a very perfect science.\r\nBut even before they had explained the nature of carbonic gas, and its\r\naffinity to calcareous earth, I am not sure but that Dr Hutton's theory\r\nwas, at least, partly formed, though it must certainly have remained,\r\neven in his own opinion, exposed to great difficulties. His active and\r\npenetrating genius soon perceived, in the experiments of his friend,\r\nthe solution of those difficulties, and formed that happy combination\r\nof principles, which has enabled him to explain the most enigmatical\r\nappearances in the natural history of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs we are not yet far removed from the time when our chemical knowledge\r\nwas too imperfect to admit of a satisfactory explanation of the\r\nphenomena of mineralogy, so it is not unlikely that we are approaching\r\nto other discoveries that are to throw new light on this science. It\r\nwould, however, be to argue strangely to say, that we must wait till\r\nthose discoveries are made before we begin any theoretical reasonings.\r\nIf this rule were followed, we should not know where the imperfections\r\nof our science lay, nor when the remedies were found out, should we\r\nbe in a condition to avail ourselves of them. Such conduct would not\r\nbe caution, but timidity, and an excess of prudence fatal to all\r\nphilosophical inquiry.\r\n\r\n458. The truth, indeed, is, that in physical inquiries, the work of\r\ntheory and observation must go hand in hand, and ought to be carried\r\non at the same time, more especially if the matter is very complicated,\r\nfor there the clue of theory is necessary to direct the observer.\r\nThough a man may begin to observe without any hypothesis, he cannot\r\ncontinue long without seeing some general conclusion arise; and to this\r\nnascent theory it is his business to attend, because, by seeking either\r\nto verify or to disprove it, he is led to new experiments, or new\r\nobservations. He is led also to the very experiments and observations\r\nthat are of the greatest importance, namely, to those _instantiæ\r\ncrucis_, which are the _criteria_ that naturally present themselves\r\nfor the trial of every hypothesis. He is conducted to the places where\r\nthe transitions of nature are most perceptible, and where the absence\r\nof former, or the presence of new circumstances, excludes the action\r\nof imaginary causes. By this correction of his first opinion, a new\r\napproximation is made to the truth; and by the repetition of the same\r\nprocess, certainty is finally obtained. Thus theory and observation\r\nmutually assist one another; and the spirit of system, against which\r\nthere are so many and such just complaints, appears, nevertheless, as\r\nthe animating principle of inductive investigation. The business of\r\nsound philosophy is not to extinguish this spirit, but to restrain and\r\ndirect its efforts.\r\n\r\n459. It is therefore hurtful to the progress of physical science to\r\nrepresent observation and theory as standing opposed to one another.\r\nBergman has said, \"Observationes veras quàm ingeniosissimas fictiones\r\nsequi præstat; naturæ mysteria potius indagare quàm divinare.\"\r\n\r\nIf it is meant by this merely to say, that it is better to have facts\r\nwithout theory, than theory without facts, and that it is wiser to\r\ninquire into the secrets of nature, than to guess at them, the truth\r\nof the maxim will hardly be controverted. But if we are to understand\r\nby it, as some may perhaps have done, that all theory is mere fiction,\r\nand that the only alternative a philosopher has, is to devote himself\r\nto the study of facts unconnected by theory, or of theory unsupported\r\nby facts, the maxim is as far from the truth, as I am convinced it is\r\nfrom the real sense of Bergman. Such an opposition between the business\r\nof the theorist and the observer, can only occur when the speculations\r\nof the former are vague and indistinct, and cannot be so embodied as to\r\nbecome visible to the latter. But the philosopher who has ascended to\r\nhis theory by a regular generalization of facts, and who descends from\r\nit again by drawing such palpable conclusions as may be compared with\r\nexperience, furnishes the infallible means of distinguishing between\r\n_perfect science_ and _ingenious fiction_. Of a geological theory that\r\nhas stood this double test of the analytic and synthetic methods, Dr\r\nHutton has furnished us with an excellent instance, in his explanation\r\nof granite. The appearances which he observed in that stone led him to\r\nconclude, that it had been melted, and injected while fluid, among the\r\nstratified rocks already formed. He then considered, that if this is\r\ntrue, veins of granite must often run from the larger masses of that\r\nstone, and penetrate the strata in various directions; and this must\r\nbe visible at those places where these different kinds of rock come\r\ninto contact with one another. This led him to search in Arran and\r\nGlentilt for the phenomena in question; the result, as we have seen,\r\nafforded to his theory the fullest confirmation, and to himself the\r\nhigh satisfaction which must ever accompany the success of candid and\r\njudicious inquiry.\r\n\r\n460. It cannot, however, be denied, that the impartiality of an\r\nobserver may often be affected by system; but this is a misfortune\r\nagainst which the want of theory is not always a complete security.\r\nThe partialities in favour of opinions are not more dangerous than\r\nthe prejudices against them; for such is the spirit of system, and so\r\nnaturally do all men's notions tend to reduce themselves into some\r\nregular form, that the very belief that there can be no theory, becomes\r\na theory itself, and may have no inconsiderable sway over the mind\r\nof an observer. Besides, one man may have as much delight in pulling\r\ndown, as another has in building up, and may choose to display his\r\ndexterity in the one occupation as well as in the other. The want\r\nof theory, then, does not secure the candour of an observer, and it\r\nmay very much diminish his skill. The discipline that seems best\r\ncalculated to promote both, is a thorough knowledge of the methods of\r\ninductive investigation; an acquaintance with the history of physical\r\ndiscovery; and the careful study of those sciences in which the rules\r\nof philosophising have been most successfully applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nMinor typos corrected.
