The subject matter has not been\r\nselected with the object of covering the field of Western geography\r\nin a systematic manner, but instead the attempt has been made to\r\npicture as graphically as may be some of its more striking and\r\ninteresting physical features, and the influence which these features\r\nhave exerted upon its discovery and settlement.\r\n\r\nThose subjects have been presented which have more than local interest\r\nand are illustrative of world-wide principles. Clear conceptions\r\nof the earth and man's relation to it are not gained by general\r\nstatements as readily as by the comprehensive study of concrete\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nNowhere outside of the Cordilleran region are to be found so remarkable\r\nillustrations of the growth and destruction of physical features, or\r\nso clear examples of the control which physical features exercise\r\nover the paths of exploration, settlement, and industrial development.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the West furnishes a wealth of material for geography\r\nteaching has long been recognized in a general way, although there\r\nhas been but little attempt to present this material in a form\r\nsuitable for the use of schools.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are, with few exceptions, from the author's own\r\nphotographs, and the descriptions are made up from his personal\r\nobservations. Since the illustrations are numerous and have been\r\nselected with much care, it is hoped that they will add greatly\r\nto the value of the text. They should be _used_, and a proper\r\nunderstanding of the pictures made a part of every lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE COLORADO RIVER\r\n\r\nA TRIP INTO THE GRAND CANON OF THE COLORADO\r\n\r\nHOW THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU WAS MADE\r\n\r\nTHE CANONS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nAN OREGON GLACIER\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND MOUNTAIN BUILDING\r\n\r\nTHE LAST VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nTHE MUD VOLCANOES OF THE COLORADO DESERT\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF A COAST LINE\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BASIN AND ITS PECULIAR LAKES\r\n\r\nFREMONT'S ADVENTURES IN THE GREAT BASIN\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GREAT SALT LAKE\r\n\r\nTHE SKAGIT RIVER\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LAKE CHELAN\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LEWIS AND CLARK\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIANS IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nDEATH VALLEY\r\n\r\nTHE CLIFF DWELLERS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nTHE PONY EXPRESS\r\n\r\nHOW CLIMATE AND PHYSICAL FEATURES INFLUENCED THE SETTLEMENT OF THE\r\nWEST\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE PROSPECTOR\r\n\r\nGOLD AND GOLD-MINING\r\n\r\nCOPPER-MINING\r\n\r\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMATE OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT IRRIGATION\r\n\r\nTHE LOCATION OF THE CITIES OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST BELT OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL PARKS AND FOREST RESERVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE COLORADO RIVER\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River is not old, as we estimate the age of rivers.\r\nIt was born when the Rocky Mountains were first uplifted to the\r\nsky, when their lofty peaks, collecting the moisture of the storms,\r\nsent streams dashing down to the plains below. Upon the western\r\nslope of the mountains a number of these streams united in one\r\ngreat river, which wound here and there, seeking the easiest route\r\nacross the plateau to the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nAt first the banks of the river were low, and its course was easily\r\nturned one way or another. From the base of the mountains to the\r\nlevel of the ocean there is a fall of more than a mile, so that the\r\nriver ran swiftly and was not long in making for itself a definite\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of years passed. America was discovered. The Spaniards\r\nconquered Mexico and sent expeditions northward in search of the cities\r\nof Cibola, where it was said that gold and silver were abundant.\r\nOne of these parties is reported to have reached a mighty canon,\r\ninto which it was impossible to descend. The canon was so deep\r\nthat rocks standing in the bottom, which were in reality higher\r\nthan the Seville cathedral, appeared no taller than a man.\r\n\r\nAnother party discovered the mouth of the river and called it,\r\nbecause of their safe arrival, The River of Our Lady of Safe Conduct.\r\nThey went as far up the river as its shallow waters would permit,\r\nbut failed to find the seven cities of which they were in search,\r\nand turned about and went back to Mexico. For years afterward the\r\nriver remained undisturbed, so far as white men were concerned.\r\nA great part of the stream was unknown even to the Indians, for\r\nthe barren plateaus upon either side offered no inducements to\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nTrappers and explorers in the Rocky Mountains reached the head\r\nwaters of the river nearly one hundred years ago, and followed\r\nthe converging branches down as far as they dared toward the dark\r\nand forbidding canons. It was believed that no boat could pass\r\nthrough the canons, and that once launched upon those turbid waters,\r\nthe adventurer would never be able to return.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado remained a river of mystery for nearly three centuries\r\nafter its discovery. When California and New Mexico had become a\r\npart of the Union, about the middle of the last century, the canon\r\nof the Colorado was approached at various points by government\r\nexploring parties, which brought back more definite reports concerning\r\nthe rugged gorge through which the river flows.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Major Powell, at the head of a small party, undertook the\r\ndangerous trip through the canon by boat. After enduring great\r\nhardships for a number of weeks, the party succeeded in reaching\r\nthe lower end of the canon. Major Powell's exploit has been repeated\r\nby only one other company, and some members of this party perished\r\nbefore the dangerous feat was accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE GRAND CANON OF THE COLORADO\r\n\r\nThe work of a river]\r\n\r\nThe Colorado is a wonderful stream. It is fed by the perpetual snows\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. For some distance the tributary streams\r\nflow through fertile valleys, many of them now richly and widely\r\ncultivated. But soon the branches unite in one mighty river which,\r\nseeming to shun life and sunlight, buries itself so deeply in the\r\ngreat plateau that the traveller through this region may perish\r\nin sight of its waters without being able to descend far enough\r\nto reach them. After passing through one hundred miles of canon,\r\nthe river emerges upon a desert region, where the rainfall is so\r\nslight that curious and unusual forms of plants and animals have\r\nbeen developed, forms which are adapted to withstand the almost\r\nperpetual sunshine and scorching heat of summer.\r\n\r\nBelow the Grand Canon the river traverses an open valley, where\r\nthe bottom lands support a few Indians who raise corn, squashes,\r\nand other vegetables. At the Needles the river is hidden for a\r\nshort time within canon walls, but beyond Yuma the valley widens,\r\nand the stream enters upon vast plains over which it flows to its\r\nmouth in the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nNo portion of the river is well adapted to navigation. Below the\r\ncanon the channels are shallow and ever changing. At the mouth,\r\nenormous tides sweep with swift currents over the shallows and\r\nproduce foam-decked waves known as the \"bore.\"\r\n\r\nVisit the Colorado River whenever you will, at flood time in early\r\nsummer, or in the fall and winter when the waters are lowest, you\r\nwill always find it deeply discolored. The name \"Colorado\" signifies\r\nred, and was given to the river by the Spaniards. Watch the current\r\nand note how it boils and seethes. It seems to be thick with mud. The\r\nbars are almost of the same color as the water and are continually\r\nchanging. Here a low alluvial bank is being washed away, there a\r\nbroad flat is forming. With the exception of the Rio Grande in\r\nNew Mexico, and the Gila, which joins the Colorado at Yuma, no\r\nother river is known to be so laden with silt. No other river is\r\nso rapidly removing the highlands through which it flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--LOOKING DOWN THE COLORADO RIVER FROM ABOVE\r\nTHE NEEDLES]\r\n\r\nOver a large portion of the watershed of the Colorado the rainfall\r\nis light. This fact might lead one to think that upon its slopes\r\nthe work of erosion would go on more slowly than where the rainfall\r\nis heavy. This would, however, be a wrong conclusion, for in places\r\nwhere there is a great deal of rain the ground becomes covered\r\nwith a thick growth of vegetation which holds the soil and broken\r\nrock fragments and keeps them from being carried away.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the plateaus and lower mountain slopes in the basin\r\nof the Colorado are but little protected by vegetation. When the rain\r\ndoes fall in this arid region, it often comes with great violence.\r\nThe barren mountain sides are quickly covered with trickling streams,\r\nwhich unite in muddy torrents in the gulches, carrying along mud,\r\nsand, and even boulders in their rapid course; the torrents in\r\nturn deliver a large part of their loads to the river. As the rain\r\npasses, the gulches become dry and remain so until another storm\r\nvisits the region. It is storming somewhere within the basin of\r\nthe Colorado much of the time, for the river drains two hundred\r\nand twenty-three thousand square miles. So it comes about that\r\nwhether one visits the river in winter or summer one always finds\r\nit loaded with mud.\r\n\r\nBut what becomes of all this mud? The river cannot drop it in the\r\nnarrow canons. It is not until the river has carried its load of\r\nmud down to the region about its mouth, where the current becomes\r\nsluggish, that the heavy brown burden can be discharged. Dip up\r\na glassful of the water near the mouth of the river, and let it\r\nsettle, then carefully remove the clear water and allow the sediment\r\nin the bottom to dry. If the water in the glass was six inches\r\ndeep, there will finally remain in the bottom a mass of hardened\r\nmud, which will vary in amount with the time of the year in which\r\nthe experiment is performed, but will average about one-fiftieth\r\nof an inch in thickness. Each cubic foot of the water, then, must\r\ncontain nearly six cubic inches of solid sediment or silt.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the average flow of the Colorado River\r\nat Yuma throughout the year is eighteen thousand cubic feet of\r\nwater per second. From this fact we can calculate that there would\r\nbe deposited at the mouth of the river every year, enough sediment\r\nto lie one foot deep over sixty-six square miles of territory.\r\nNearly one three-hundredth part of the Colorado River water is\r\nsilt, while in the case of the Mississippi the silt forms only one\r\npart in twenty-nine hundred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--LOOKING TOWARD THE DELTA OF THE COLORADO\r\nFROM YUMA]\r\n\r\nNow we are prepared to understand the origin of the vast lowlands\r\nabout the head of the Gulf of California. Long ago this gulf extended\r\none hundred and fifty miles farther north than it does at present,\r\nso that it reached nearly to the place where the little town of\r\nIndio now stands in the northern end of the Colorado desert.\r\n\r\nWhen the Colorado River first began to flow, it emptied its waters\r\ninto the gulf not far from the spot where Yuma is situated. The\r\nwater was probably loaded with silt then as it is now. Part of\r\nthis sediment was dropped at the mouth of the stream, while part\r\nwas spread by the currents over the bottom of the adjoining portions\r\nof the gulf. The rapidly growing delta crept southward and westward\r\ninto the gulf. As fast as the sediment was built up above the reach\r\nof the tide, vegetation appeared, which, retarding the flow of\r\nthe water at times of flood, aided the deposition of silt and the\r\nbuilding up of the delta.\r\n\r\nAs the centuries went by, these lowland plains became more and\r\nmore extensive, until the gulf was actually divided into two parts\r\nby the spreading of the delta across to the western shore. The\r\nportion of the gulf thus cut off from the ocean formed a salt lake\r\nfully one hundred miles in length.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that for a long time before the barrier was high\r\nand strong, the tidal currents occasionally broke over the delta\r\nand supplied the lake with water. As the river meandered here and\r\nthere over the flat delta, its channels must have undergone many\r\nchanges at every time of flood. A part of the water without doubt\r\nflowed into the salt lake, and another portion into the open gulf.\r\nIn fact, the basin in which the lake lay, now known as the Colorado\r\ndesert, continued to receive water from the river, at intervals,\r\nuntil very recently. In 1891 an overflow occurred, through the\r\nchannel known as New River, which flooded the lower portion of the\r\nbasin and threatened to cover the railroad.\r\n\r\nWhen the ocean had been permanently shut off from the head of the\r\ngulf, and the river itself had been largely diverted toward the south,\r\nthe lake began to dry up. At last, most of the water disappeared\r\nand there remained a vast desert basin, at its greatest depth two\r\nhundred and fifty feet below the level of the ocean. In the bottom\r\nof the basin a bed of salt appeared, for this substance could not\r\nbe carried away, as the water had been, by the thirsty air.\r\n\r\nRemarkably perfect beaches still exist around the shores of this\r\nold lake, and on them are found the pearly shells of multitudes\r\nof fresh-water mollusks. The presence of these shells leads us to\r\nbelieve that after the salt lake dried up, the river again broke\r\nin and formed a new lake of comparatively fresh water which also,\r\nafter a time, dried up.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful fertility of the Colorado delta is just beginning\r\nto be appreciated. Canals have been dug to take the water from the\r\nriver and distribute it over the land. Year by year the cultivated\r\nlands are being extended. The change which irrigation is making\r\nupon the surface of one of the worst deserts in the country is\r\nindeed remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River is working on quietly and steadily. We may think,\r\nand truly, that it has already done a great at work in excavating the\r\nmighty canons along its course, but, in reality, the work already\r\naccomplished is small in comparison with that which remains to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIn time, if the land is not disturbed by the forces which build\r\nmountains, the plateaus through which the river now flows in such\r\ndeep canons will be carried away in the form of sand and mud. Broad\r\nvalleys will replace the canons, and the Gulf of California will\r\nbecome a fertile plain. As the highlands wear away the process\r\nwill go on more and more slowly, for there will be less rainfall.\r\nThe river will become smaller and its basin more arid. All these\r\nchanges will be brought about through the crumbling of the rocks,\r\nand the removal of the waste matter by the running water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIP INTO THE GRAND CANON OF THE COLORADO\r\n\r\nWe may read of the Colorado plateau, and of the Grand Canon with\r\nits precipitous walls of variously colored rock, but unless we\r\nactually visit this wonderland, it is hard to realize the height\r\nand extent of the plateau and the depth of the gashes made in its\r\nsurface by running water, gashes so deep that they seem to expose\r\nthe very heart of the earth.\r\n\r\nNature has chosen a remote and half-desert region for the location\r\nof this, the most picturesque canon in the world, as if she wished\r\nto keep it as long as possible from the eyes of men. Once a traveller\r\ncould not view the canon without making a long and weary journey\r\nacross hundreds of miles of desert; now it is quite different, for\r\none can almost look into its depths from the windows of a palace\r\ncar. But to appreciate and understand fully the stupendous work\r\nthat nature has done throughout this region we must leave the cars\r\nat a somewhat distant point, and before reaching the canon become\r\nacquainted with the country in which it lies through the old-fashioned\r\nways of travelling on horseback or wagon.\r\n\r\nFlagstaff was formerly the starting-point for travellers to the\r\ncanon, and we will choose it now, for the old stage road offers an\r\ninteresting ride. The road first winds around that lofty snow-clad\r\npeak, the San Francisco Mountain, which can be seen from all northern\r\nArizona. Leaving the mountain behind, we strike out directly across\r\nthe high plateau. The country is nearly level, and the open park-like\r\nforest extends in every direction as far as one can see.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us to believe that we are seven thousand feet\r\nabove the sea, a height greater than that of the highest mountains\r\nin the United States east of the Mississippi Valley. It is this\r\nelevation, however, which brings the summer showers and makes the\r\nair cool and pleasant, for the lowlands of this portion of the\r\nUnited States are barren deserts, upon which the sun beats with\r\nalmost savage heat.\r\n\r\nAfter the rainy season green grass and an abundance of flowers\r\nappear in the open meadows scattered through the forest. But, as a\r\nrule, the entire absence of water strikes one as being very strange.\r\nWhere are the springs and running streams which usually abound\r\nin mountainous regions? Throughout the whole distance of seventy\r\nmiles from Flagstaff to the canon, there are but one or two spots\r\nwhere water is to be found. These places are known as \"water-holes\";\r\nthey are simply hollows in the surface of the ground where the\r\nwater collects after the showers.\r\n\r\nThere is another strange feature about the plateau over which the\r\nroad leads; instead of sloping down toward the Colorado River and\r\nthe Grand Canon, the surface slowly rises, so that the little streams\r\nwhich are formed after the heavy rains flow away from the river.\r\n\r\nOur journey draws to an end, but there is nothing to indicate the\r\npresence of the canon until we get glimpses through the trees of\r\nan apparently bottomless gulf. The gulf widens upon a closer view,\r\nwe reach the edge, and all its wonderful proportions burst upon\r\nus. Does the Grand Canon look as you thought it would? Probably\r\nnot, for it is unlike any other in the world. The canon is very\r\ndeep. The river has worn its way for more than a mile down into\r\nthe plateau, which once stretched unbroken from the cliffs upon\r\nwhich we stand, across to those upon the opposite side, nearly\r\nten miles away.\r\n\r\nThe clear air makes objects upon the opposite side and in the bottom\r\nof the canon seem much nearer than they really are. You may think\r\nthat it is an easy task to go to the bottom of the canon and climb\r\nback again in a day, but in reality it is so difficult an undertaking\r\nthat only those who are accustomed to mountain climbing can accomplish\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely the great width and depth of the canon that impress\r\nus, but also the bright, variegated colors which the different\r\nrock layers display as they stretch in horizontal bands along the\r\nfaces of the cliffs, or sweep around the towers and pinnacles until\r\ntheir detailed outlines are lost in the distant blue haze.\r\n\r\nOur eyes wander far down, toward the bottom of the canon, following\r\nthe alternate lines of precipitous cliffs and slopes covered with\r\nrock fragments. The cliffs and slopes succeed each other like the\r\nsteps in a giant stairway, until at the very bottom the opposite\r\nwalls meet in a gorge so narrow that in only a few places does\r\nthe river come into view, glistening like a silver thread.\r\n\r\nA hotel stands among the trees a short distance from the brink of\r\nthe canon. Living here is expensive, for every article of food has\r\nto be brought upon the cars and wagons for a distance of hundreds\r\nof miles. Even the water has to be brought in wagons from a distant\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--A SCENE ON THE TRAIL]\r\n\r\nIn visiting the canon we have the choice of going on horseback\r\nor on foot. While the latter method is much harder, yet one feels\r\nsafer upon his own feet while moving along the steep and narrow\r\ntrail. Our start is made in the cool air of the early morning.\r\nLeaving the top of the plateau, where among the pines the summer\r\nair is seldom sultry, and the winters are cold and snowy, we descend,\r\nuntil, by luncheon time, we are far below the heights and in the\r\nmidst of an almost tropical climate. This difference in climatic\r\nfeatures between the top and bottom of the canon is equal to the\r\nchange which the traveller experiences in a trip from the pine\r\nforests of the northern United States to the cactus-covered plains\r\nof Arizona.\r\n\r\nAs we look down from the top of the trail it does not seem possible\r\nto pass the great cliffs below, and yet there must be a way, since\r\nothers have gone before us. All that we have to do is simply to\r\nfollow the beaten path. Nature has conveniently left narrow shelves,\r\ncrevices, and less precipitous slopes here and there, which need\r\nonly the application of the pick and shovel to be made passable\r\neven for pack animals. Where the trail winds into shady recesses,\r\nwe find stunted fir and pine trees clinging to the crevices and\r\nstretching their roots down into the waste rock collected upon\r\nprojecting ledges.\r\n\r\nDown, down we go. The belt of the yellow pine and fir is left behind,\r\nand we come to the habitat of the pinon pine and juniper. These two\r\nwill flourish where there is less moisture than is needed by the\r\ntrees which grow nearer the top. Soon the trees have all disappeared\r\nand such plants as the greasewood, cactus, and agave take their\r\nplace. Here, if it were not for the walls of rock rising on every\r\nhand, we might imagine ourselves upon one of the desert plains\r\nof Arizona.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--CLIFFS ON THE TRAIL INTO THE GRAND CANON]\r\n\r\nNew views open at every turn in the trail, as it winds along the\r\nnarrow shelves of rock with precipitous walls above and below.\r\nNow it zigzags back and forth down a gentle slope, but is soon\r\nstopped by another precipice. In one place, to escape a rocky point,\r\nthe trail has been carried around the face of a cliff on a sort\r\nof shelf made of logs. It then passes through a crevice formed by\r\nthe splitting away of a huge piece of the wall. In many places the\r\ngrade is so steep that the trail is made practically a stairway,\r\nfor the steps are necessary to keep animals from slipping.\r\n\r\nStep by step we descend until the slope becomes more gentle and\r\na sort of terrace is reached, where men are at work developing a\r\ncopper mine. Everything needed for the mine is carried down packed\r\nupon the backs of sure-footed burros. Even the water has to be\r\nbrought in kegs from a little spring still deeper in the canon.\r\n\r\nThe trail leaves the mine and winds down past another cliff, until,\r\nwhen more than three thousand feet from the top of the plateau,\r\nwe find water for the first time. The little springs issue from\r\nthe sandstone, and their limited supply of water is soon drunk\r\nup by the thirsty sands.\r\n\r\nAs far as the water flows it forms a little oasis upon the barren\r\nslope. Along the course of the streams are little patches of green\r\ngrass, flowers, and bushes. Birds flit about, and there are tracks\r\nof small animals in the mud. Evidently the water is as great an\r\nattraction to them as it is to us. If a well were dug in the plateau\r\nabove, we can understand now how deep it would have to be in order\r\nto reach water. A well three-fourths of a mile deep would be a\r\ndifficult one to pump.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the bottom of the main canon, but deeper still is\r\nthe last and inner gorge, through which the Colorado is flowing.\r\nFor thousands of centuries the river has been sawing its way down\r\ninto the earth. The precipitous cliffs which we have passed are\r\nformed of hard sandstone or limestone. The more gentle slopes consist\r\nof softer shales. Now the river has cut through them all and has\r\nreached the very heart of the earth, the solid granite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--THE INNER GORGE OF THE GRAND CANON OF THE\r\nCOLORADO]\r\n\r\nThis inner gorge has almost vertical walls twelve hundred to fifteen\r\nhundred feet high. We can sit upon the brink under a ledge of rock\r\nwhich protects us from the hot sun, and watch the river as we eat\r\nour luncheon. Far below, almost directly under us, it rushes along.\r\nThe roar of the current rises but faintly to our ears. The water\r\nis very muddy and not at all like the clear mountain streams, far\r\naway upon the continental divide, which unite to form the river.\r\nIt seems as if the water, ashamed of its soiled appearance, wanted\r\nto hide from the sight of men. If so, it has succeeded well, for\r\nit can be seen only at rare intervals from the top of the canon\r\nwalls, and even at the bottom of the main canon the river itself\r\nis not visible unless one stands upon the very brink of the granite\r\ngorge.\r\n\r\nThe work of the river is not yet done. It will go on until the\r\ngreat cliffs have crumbled and have been replaced by gentle slopes.\r\nIt will not stop until, at some far distant time, a broad valley\r\nhas been worn out of the rocky strata.\r\n\r\nThe canon appears much wider when viewed from the bottom than from\r\nthe top, and the great cliffs far back along the trail seem less\r\nprecipitous, but only because they are so far away. A weary climb\r\nof several miles awaits us. We must rest and take breath frequently\r\nor we shall not reach the top.\r\n\r\nAs night approaches and the shadows begin to fall, every turret\r\nand pinnacle stands out in bold relief. The bands of yellow and\r\nred shade into purple, and everything, save the long winding trail,\r\nbegins to have a weird and mystical look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU WAS MADE\r\n\r\nYears ago people disputed as to the way in which the earth was made.\r\nThose who lived where all the rocks had, like lava, the appearance\r\nof having once been melted, believed that fire had done all the\r\nwork. Those who lived where the rocks appeared to be formed of\r\nhardened mud, sand, and lime, substances such as we find accumulating\r\nunder water, said that water alone had been the means. But in later\r\nyears the earth's surface has been more widely explored, and now\r\nit is known that both opinions were partly right. Water and fire\r\nhave both been concerned in the making of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the great valleys fire-formed rocks are rare, but they are more\r\nor less abundant in all mountainous regions, for where mountains\r\nare, there the crust of the earth is weakest. There are many reasons\r\nfor believing that the interior of the earth is very hot. We know\r\nthat the surface is settling in some places and rising in others,\r\nand that where the strain of the upheaval is too great the rocks are\r\nbroken. These convulsions sometimes cause earthquakes and sometimes\r\nvolcanic eruptions, when enormous quantities of molten rock are\r\npoured out over the surface. In all the long history of our earth\r\nprobably no greater flood of lava than that which made the Columbia\r\nplateau was ever spread over the surface of any region. Travel where\r\nyou will over the plains of southern Idaho, central Washington,\r\nor Oregon, and examine the rocks which here and there rise above\r\nthe soil or are exposed in the canons, and you will find that they\r\nall appear to have been formed by fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--SNAKE RIVER AT IDAHO FALLS\r\n\r\nJust beginning to cut a canon in the volcanic plateau]\r\n\r\nThese rocks are dark in color and very hard. They are not arranged\r\nin regular layers like sandstone and shale; many of them show numerous\r\nlittle cavities which once contained steam. These cavities give\r\nto the rock a slag-like appearance. In this kind of rock, which\r\nwe shall call lava, there are, of course, no remains of shells\r\nor bones of animals such as are often found in rocks formed from\r\nsand or clay.\r\n\r\nDo not picture to yourself the Columbia plateau as one continuous\r\nstretch of level land, for it is broken by many mountain ranges.\r\nSome of these are old mountains which were too tall to be buried\r\nby the lava, but most of them have been formed out of the plateau\r\nitself. The eruptions which made the plateau extended through a\r\nvery long time, perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, and the\r\nolder lava is deeply decayed and covered with soil. Some of the\r\nlater flows show extremely rough and rugged surfaces and are probably\r\nonly a few hundred years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE COLUMBIA PLATEAU]\r\n\r\nLong ago, before the eruptions began, the geography of the Northwest\r\nwas very different from what it is now. Instead of a vast plateau\r\nthere were mountains and valleys. Lowlands occupied most of the\r\nregion where the Cascade Range now rises with its lofty volcanic\r\npeaks. Portions of the basin of the present Columbia River were\r\noccupied by lakes which extended southwest into California.\r\n\r\nMovements of the earth began to affect the region of the present\r\nplateau, and at many points the solid rocks were fissured and broken.\r\nThen from that mysterious region far beneath the surface came steam\r\nand gases, escaping through the fissures with explosive force.\r\nIn some places cinder cones were built about the openings by the\r\nfragments of lava which were hurled out. In other places, during\r\nperiods of less explosive eruption, molten lava flowed out in vast\r\nquantities. The lava was very hot and almost as liquid as water,\r\nso that it spread in thin sheets over hundreds of square miles\r\nof lowland.\r\n\r\nOne important series of fissures through which eruptions took place\r\nmarked the line where the Cascade Range was to be built. Other\r\nvolcanoes appeared over the surface of southern Idaho, central\r\nWashington, Oregon, and northeastern California.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions were not continuous over the whole field; now in\r\nthis place, now in that, there came long periods of quiet. During\r\nsuch periods the earthquakes ceased, the lava became cold, and\r\nthe clouds of volcanic ashes cleared from the air. Frequently the\r\nlava intercepted streams and blocked the valleys so that large\r\nlakes were formed. Whenever the periods of quiet were very long,\r\nplants spread over the surface and animals of many kinds made their\r\nhomes about the lakes.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Oregon the John Day River and its branches have eroded\r\ncanons through the later lava and have exposed the sands, clays,\r\nand gravels which collected at the bottom of one of those ancient\r\nlakes. In these beds the skeletons of many strange and interesting\r\nanimals have been found. Evidently they had once lived about the\r\nborders of the lake, and the streams had washed their bones into\r\nthe water and mingled them with the sediment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--BLUE LAKES, IDAHO\r\n\r\nFormed by springs issuing from underneath the lava of the plateau]\r\n\r\nOne of these animals appears to have been an ancestor of the present\r\nhorse. It was about the size of a sheep, and had three toes instead\r\nof one. Another, probably a very dangerous animal, was related to\r\nour present hog, but stood nearly seven feet high. Others resembled\r\nthe rhinoceros, camel, tapir, or peccary. All but the peccary are\r\nnow extinct upon this continent. Of the carnivorous animals there\r\nwere wolves and cats of large size.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions continued, filling the valleys little by little,\r\nuntil in places the lava reached a thickness of nearly four thousand\r\nfeet. The lower mountains were hidden from sight. We know of the\r\nexistence of these buried mountains because the wearing away of\r\nthe lava in some places has exposed their summits to view.\r\n\r\nThe lava flood reached farther and farther. In southern Idaho it\r\nformed the Snake River plains, which must have been, when first\r\nformed, hundreds of miles long, seventy-five miles wide, and almost\r\nas even as a floor. If we could have looked on while these things\r\nwere taking place it would have appeared as if the whole land was\r\nabout to sink under the fiery mass which flowed out of the earth.\r\nThe streams and valleys were completely buried. The region of the\r\nJohn Day Lake, with all its animal remains, was covered. The lava,\r\nlike a sea, crept up against the mountains surrounding the plateau\r\nregion. Bays of lava extended into the valleys among the mountains,\r\nwhile mountain ridges rose like islands and capes from the surface\r\nof the flood.\r\n\r\nWe never tire of looking at the lofty snow-capped peaks of the\r\nCascade Range. A dozen of them rise over ten thousand feet, and\r\ntwo, Mounts Shasta and Ranier, are more than fourteen thousand\r\nfeet high. All these mountains were formed of material thrown out\r\nof the interior of the earth during the building of the Columbia\r\nplateau. The process was very similar for each. About some one\r\nexceptionally active crater immense quantities of scoriae[1] and\r\nlapilli[2] accumulated. Then came streams of fiery lava, some of\r\nwhich, hardening upon the outer slopes of the crater, added still\r\nmore to the growth of the mountain. The process was very slow,\r\nhowever. A time of eruption, marked by tremblings of the earth,\r\nexplosive noises, and a sky filled with dust and clouds, might last\r\nfor many years. Then came a long period of rest when the falling\r\nrains, gathering in dashing torrents, cut deep gullies down the\r\nsides of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _scorioe_, cellular, slaggy lava.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _lapilli_, volcanic ashes, consisting of small, angular,\r\nstony fragments.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--PITT RIVER CANON, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nThe plateau is built of layers of lava]\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes at last ceased to grow any higher, for the lava,\r\nif the eruptions continued, formed new craters at their bases.\r\nIt is probable that all these great peaks have been extinct for\r\nseveral thousand years, although some are much older and more worn\r\naway than others. One of these volcanoes has completely disappeared,\r\nand in its place lies that wonderful sheet of water known as Crater\r\nLake. It is thought that the interior of this mountain was melted\r\naway during a period of activity, and that the outer portion fell\r\nin, leaving a crater five miles across and nearly a mile deep.\r\n\r\nThe streams of lava, as they flowed here and there building up\r\nthe plateau, frequently broke up the rivers and turned them into\r\nnew channels. As time went on the eruptions were less violent, and\r\nthe rivers became established in the channels which they occupy\r\nto-day. The Columbia River, winding about over the plateau, sought\r\nthe easiest path to the sea. It soon began to dig a channel, and\r\nnow has hidden itself between dark walls of lava.\r\n\r\nBut other forces besides the streams were now at work in this volcanic\r\nregion. The lava plateau began slowly to bend upward along the\r\nline of the great volcanoes, lifting them upward with it. In this\r\nmanner the Cascade Range was formed. The Columbia River, instead\r\nof seeking another way to the sea, continued cutting its channel\r\ndeeper and deeper into the growing mountain range, and so has given\r\nus that picturesque canon which forms a most convenient highway\r\nfrom the interior of Washington and Oregon to the coast.\r\n\r\nTake a sheet of writing paper, lay it upon an even surface, then\r\nslowly push the opposite edges toward each other. This simple experiment\r\nwill aid one in understanding one of the ways in which mountain\r\nranges are made. Besides the upward fold of the plateau which made\r\nthe Cascade Range, another was formed between the Blue Mountains\r\nin eastern Oregon and a spur of the Rocky Mountains in northern\r\nIdaho. This fold lay across the path of the Snake River, but its\r\nmovement was so slow that the river kept its former channel and\r\nin this rising land excavated a canon which to-day is more than\r\na mile deep. The upper twenty-five hundred feet of the canon are\r\ncut into the lava of the plateau, and the lower three thousand\r\ninto the underlying granite. The canon is not so picturesque as\r\nthe Colorado, for it has no rocks with variegated coloring or\r\ncastellated walls. Its sides are, however, exceedingly precipitous\r\nand it is difficult to enter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--SHOSHONE FALLS, SNAKE RIVER, IDAHO]\r\n\r\nAlong portions of the lower Columbia and Snake rivers, navigation\r\nis obstructed by rapids and waterfalls. The presence of these falls\r\nteaches us that these streams are still at work cutting their channels\r\ndeeper. The Snake River in its upper course has as yet cut only a\r\nvery shallow channel in the hard lava, and the beautiful Shoshone\r\nFalls marks a point where its work is slow. These falls, which\r\nare the finest in the northwest, owe their existence to the fact\r\nthat at this particular spot layers of strong resistant lava cover\r\nthe softer rocks.\r\n\r\nThere are other canons in the plateau region which are fully as\r\nremarkable as those which have been mentioned. That of the Des\r\nChutes River in central Oregon is in places a thousand feet deep,\r\nwith almost vertical walls of lava.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how mountains have been formed upon the Columbia\r\nplateau, by a bending of the earth upward. Other mountains of the\r\nplateau are due to fractures in the solid rocks, often many miles\r\nlong. Upon one side of these fractures the surface has been depressed,\r\nwhile upon the other it has been raised. The amount of the uplift\r\nvaries from a few hundred to thousands of feet. The mountains thus\r\nformed have a long, gentle slope upon one side and a very steep\r\nincline upon the other. They are known as \"block mountains,\" and\r\nthose upon the Columbia plateau are the most interesting of their\r\nkind in the world.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few large rivers, the greater portion of the\r\nColumbia plateau is remarkable for its lack of surface streams. The\r\nwater which reaches the borders of the plateau from the surrounding\r\nmountains often sinks into the gravel between the layers of lava and\r\nforms underground rivers. The deep canons which have been mentioned\r\nintercept some of these underground rivers, so that their waters\r\npour out and down over the sides of the canons in foaming cascades.\r\nThe greatest of these cascades is that known as the Thousand Springs\r\nin the Snake River canon. The waters of the Blue Lakes in the canon\r\nof the same river below Shoshone Falls also come from underneath\r\nthe lava. They are utilized in irrigating the most picturesque\r\nfruit ranch in southern Idaho.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--CANON OF CROOKED RIVER NEAR THE DES CHUTES\r\nRIVER\r\n\r\nEroded in the Columbia plateau]\r\n\r\nThe climate of the plateau is dry, and its eastern portion is\r\npractically a desert. Toward the west, however, the rainfall is\r\ngreater, and in central Washington and northern Oregon the plateau\r\nbecomes one vast grain-field. It is difficult to irrigate the plateau\r\nbecause the streams flow in such deep canons, but above the point\r\nwhere the canon of the Snake River begins there is an extensive\r\nsystem of canals and cultivated fields. With a sufficient water\r\nsupply, the lava makes one of the richest and most productive of\r\nsoils. Along the Snake and Columbia rivers, wherever there is a\r\nbit of bottom land, orchards have been planted. Little steamers\r\nply along these rivers between the rapids, gathering the fruit\r\nand delivering it at the nearest railroad point.\r\n\r\nMining is carried on only in the mountains which rise above the\r\nlava flood, for the mineral veins are for the most part older than\r\nthe lava of the plateau. We are certain that many very valuable\r\ndeposits of the precious metals lie buried beneath the lava fields.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the volcanic history of the Columbia plateau\r\nhas been completed. Now the streams are at work carrying away the\r\nmaterials of which it is composed and may in time uncover the old\r\nburied land surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANONS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThe western half of our country contains the deepest and most\r\npicturesque canons in the world. Those of the Colorado and Snake\r\nrivers form trenches in a comparatively level but lofty plateau\r\nregion. The canons of the Sierra Nevada Range, on the contrary,\r\ntake their rise and extend for much of their length among rugged\r\nsnowcapped peaks which include some of the highest mountains in\r\nthe United States. All these canons are the work of erosion. The\r\nrivers did not find depressions formed ready for them to occupy,\r\nbut had to excavate their channels by the slow process of grinding\r\naway the solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe streams of the Sierra Nevada mountains begin their course in\r\nsteep-walled alcoves under the shadows of the high peaks, where\r\nthey are fed by perpetual snow-banks. Soon they bury themselves\r\nbetween granite walls, which at last tower three thousand feet\r\nabove their roaring waters. After many miles the canons widen,\r\nthe walls decrease in height, and the streams come out upon the\r\nfertile stretches of the Great Valley of California.\r\n\r\nNature works in many ways. Her tools are of different kinds, but\r\nthe most important one is running water. The forms which she produces\r\nare dependent upon the kind of rock upon which she works. Where\r\nthe surface of the earth is soft the results of her labor are not\r\nvery interesting, but if the crust is hard the forms which she\r\nproduces are often so remarkable that they arouse our wonder and\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--SAN JOAQUIN RIVER EMERGING UPON THE PLAIN\r\nOF THE GREAT VALLEY]\r\n\r\nIn shaping the Sierra Nevada mountains Nature had a grand opportunity.\r\nHere she produced the Yosemite Valley, which has a setting of cliffs\r\nand waterfalls that attract people from all over the world. Hetch-Hetchy\r\nValley at the north of the Yosemite, and Tehipite and King's River\r\ncanons at the south, are interesting places, but not so majestic\r\nand inspiring as the Yosemite.\r\n\r\nNature never seems satisfied with her work. After she has created\r\na piece of wonderful scenery she proceeds to destroy it. The great\r\ncliffs of the Yosemite will sometime lose their grandeur and be\r\nreplaced by gentle slopes down which the streams will flow quietly.\r\nThe mountains of the Laurentian highlands in the northeastern portion\r\nof the continent undoubtedly were once lofty and picturesque, but\r\nthere were no people upon the earth at that time to enjoy this\r\nscenery. Now these mountains have become old and are nearly worn\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--WHERE THE CANONS BEGIN UNDER PRECIPITOUS\r\nPEAKS\r\n\r\nThe head of the King's River]\r\n\r\nIn one portion of the earth after another, Nature raises great\r\nmountain ranges and immediately proceeds to remove them. This continent\r\nwas discovered and California was settled at the right time for\r\nthe Sierra Nevadas to be seen in all their grandeur.\r\n\r\nWhen the pioneers came in sight of the Sierra Nevada (snowy range),\r\nthey little dreamed of the canons hidden among these mountains.\r\nGold, and not scenery, was the object of their search. The great\r\ncanons were outside of the gold regions, and so inaccessibly situated\r\nthat no one except the Indians looked upon them until 1851. In\r\nthat year a party of soldiers following the trail of some thieving\r\nIndians discovered and entered the Yosemite Valley, but it was not\r\nexplored until 1855. For many years the valley could be reached\r\nonly by the roughest trails, but as its advantages became more\r\nwidely known roads were built, and there are now three different\r\nwagon routes by which it may be entered.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Yosemite Valley is like that of all the other\r\ncanons of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Long ago there were no high\r\nmountains in eastern California. If there had been explorers crossing\r\nthe plains in those days, they would have found no rugged wall\r\nshutting them off from the Pacific. There came a time, however,\r\nwhen the surface of the western portion of America was broken by\r\nviolent earthquake movements, and hundreds of fissures were formed.\r\nSome of the earth blocks produced by these fissures were shoved\r\nupward, while others were dropped. One enormous block, which was\r\nto form the Sierra Nevada, was raised along its eastern edge until\r\nit stood several thousand feet above the adjoining country. The\r\nmovement was like that of a trap-door opened slightly, so that\r\nupon one side--in this case the western one--the slope was long\r\nand gentle, while upon the east it was very abrupt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--THE YOSEMITE VALLEY]\r\n\r\nNature, the sculptor, took this mountain block in hand, and with\r\nthe aid of running water began to carve its surface into a most\r\nintricate system of canons and ridges. The streams first flowed\r\nover the easiest slopes to the Great Valley of California, but\r\nsoon they began to cut their way down into the granite, while along\r\nthe crests of the ridges the more resistant rocks began to stand\r\nout as jagged peaks.\r\n\r\nThus Nature worked until the mountains promised before long to be\r\nwell worn down. The canons had widened to valleys and the rugged\r\nslopes had given place to gentle ones. Toward the northern end of\r\nthe range the work was even farther advanced, for the streams,\r\nnow choked with gravel and sand, flowed over broad flood plains.\r\nIn this gravel was buried a part of the wealth of California. The\r\nrocks over which the streams flowed contained veins of quartz with\r\nlittle particles of gold scattered through it, and as the surface\r\nrock crumbled and was worn away, the gold, being much heavier,\r\nslowly accumulated in the gravel at the bottom of the streams.\r\nThis gold amounted in value to hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe forces within the earth became active again. Apparently Nature\r\ndid not intend that the gold should be forever buried, or that the\r\ncountry should always appear so uninteresting. Internal forces\r\nraised the mountain block for a second time, tilting it still more\r\nto the westward. Volcanoes broke forth along the summit of the\r\nrange near the line of fracture, and floods of lava and volcanic\r\nmud ran down the slopes, completely filling the broad valleys of\r\nthe northern Sierras and burying a great part of the gold-bearing\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions turned the streams from their channels, but on the\r\nsteeper slope of the mountains the rivers went energetically to\r\nwork making new beds. They cut down through the lava and the buried\r\ngravel until they finally reached the solid rock underneath. Into\r\nthis rock, which we call \"bed-rock,\" they have now worn canons\r\ntwo thousand feet deep. The beds of gravel that lay under the old\r\nstreams frequently form the tops of the hills between these deep\r\ncanons. Here they are easily accessible to the miners, who by tunnels\r\nor surface workings have taken out many millions of dollars' worth\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\nThe important canons of the northern Sierras, where the gold is\r\nfound, have been made by the American and Feather rivers. Farther\r\nsouth are the deeper and more rugged canons of the Tuolumne, Merced,\r\nKing's, and Kern rivers, which open to us inviting pathways into\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the mantle of snow and ice which at that\r\ntime covered most of the surface of the earth would have protected\r\nit from further erosion, but this was not the case. In the basin\r\nat the head of each stream the snow accumulated year after year\r\nuntil it was more than a thousand feet deep. Under the influence\r\nof the warm days and cold nights the snow slowly turned to ice,\r\nand moved by its own weight, crept down into the canons. The solid\r\nrock walls were ground and polished, and even now, so long a time\r\nafter the glaciers have melted, some of these polished surfaces\r\nstill glisten in the sunlight. The glaciers deepened and enlarged\r\nthe canons, but running water was the most important agent in their\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nUpon the disappearance of the glaciers, the streams went to work\r\nagain deepening their canons. From their starting-points, under\r\nthe lofty crags, they first ran through broad upland valleys, then\r\ntumbled into the canons; but until they had reached the lower mountain\r\nslopes, to which the glaciers had not extended, they passed through\r\na dreary and desolate region devoid of almost every sign of life.\r\nThe glaciers had swept away all the loose rock and soil, and it was\r\nmany long years before the surface again crumbled so that forest\r\ntrees could spread over it once more.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur and attractiveness of the Yosemite is partly due to\r\nthe precipitous cliffs enclosing the valley, some of which are\r\nnearly four thousand feet in height, partly to the high waterfalls,\r\nand partly to the green meadows and forest groves through which\r\nthe Merced River winds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the glaciers had little to do with the making of the Yosemite\r\nValley, yet they added to its attractiveness. The valley is situated\r\nwhere a number of smaller streams join the Merced River. Erosion was\r\nmore rapid here because the granite was soft, while the vertical\r\nseams in the rock gave the growing valley precipitous walls. When\r\nthe glacier came it pushed out the loose rocks and boulders, and\r\ndropping a portion of them at the lower end, made a dam across\r\nthe Merced River. At first a shallow lake filled the valley, but\r\nafter a time the silt and gravel which the streams were continually\r\nbringing in filled the lake, and formed marshy flats. Finally,\r\ngrasses and trees spread over these flats and gave the valley the\r\nappearance which it has to-day.\r\n\r\nBesides the meadows, the glaciers gave us two of the waterfalls.\r\nYosemite Creek, which comes down over the walls twenty-seven hundred\r\nfeet in three successive falls, was turned into its present channel\r\nby a dam which a glacier had left across its old course. A glacier\r\nalso turned the Merced River at its entrance to the main valley\r\nso as to form the Nevada Fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE CANON OF BUBB'S CREEK, A BRANCH OF\r\nTHE KING'S RIVER CANON]\r\n\r\nAfter the valley had been made and clothed in vegetation, it was\r\ndiscovered by a small tribe of Indians who came here to make their\r\nhome, secure from all their enemies. There were fish in the streams\r\nand animals in the woods. The oaks supplied acorns, and in early\r\nsummer the meadows were covered with strawberries. Legends were\r\nassociated with many of the cliffs and waterfalls, for the Indians,\r\nlike ourselves, are impressed by the wonders of Nature.\r\n\r\nHetch-Hetchy Valley, twenty-five miles north of the Yosemite, has\r\nbeen formed upon much the same plan, but a portion of its floor\r\nis marshy and there are few waterfalls. King's River Canon has\r\nno green meadows and no high waterfalls, while its great granite\r\nwalls are not so precipitous as those of the Yosemite. Next to\r\nthe Yosemite, in the wildness of its scenery, is Tehipite Canon.\r\nThis canon is situated upon the middle fork of King's River, about\r\na hundred miles south. For many miles its walls and domes present\r\never changing views.\r\n\r\nA continual struggle is going on between the forces within the\r\nearth and the sculptor working upon its surface. First one, then\r\nthe other, gains the advantage. Where the mountains are steep and\r\nhigh, often the forces within have recently been active. Where\r\nthey are low and the slopes are gentle, the sculptor has long held\r\nsway. She begins by making the surface as rough and picturesque\r\nas possible, but after a time she destroys her own handiwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OREGON GLACIER\r\n\r\nThere are records all about us of events which took place upon the\r\nearth long before there were any human inhabitants. These records\r\nhave been preserved in the rocks, in the geographic features of\r\nthe land and water, and in the distribution of the animals and\r\nplants. On every hand appear evidences of changes in the surface\r\nof the earth and in the climate.\r\n\r\nThrough all the central and northern United States, if we except\r\nsome of the mountains of the West, the winter snows entirely disappear\r\nlong before the coming of summer. But the climate of this region\r\nhas not always been so pleasant and mild. Lands now densely peopled\r\nwere once buried under a thick mantle of ice which lasted through\r\nmany thousands of years.\r\n\r\nScattered over the surface of the northern United States are vast\r\nnumbers of boulders and rock fragments which are not at all like\r\nthe solid rocks beneath the soil. The history of these materials\r\ntakes us back to the Glacial period, which can be best understood\r\nfrom a study of some one of the glaciers now existing upon the\r\nmountains of the northwestern part of our country.\r\n\r\nAmong the lofty mountain ranges of the Cordilleran region there\r\nare many peaks upon which perpetual snow-banks nestle, defying\r\nthe long summer days. Where the winters are long and cold and the\r\nstorms are severe, immense drifts of snow collect in the hollows\r\nand canons of the mountain slopes. Each summer all or a part of\r\nthis snow melts. Upon the northern slopes the melting process is\r\nslower, and if there happens to be a large basin upon that side,\r\nan extensive field of snow remains until the winter storms come\r\nagain. Each winter new snow is added to the surface, while the\r\nolder snow, becoming hard and firm through repeated freezing and\r\nthawing, at last turns to ice.\r\n\r\nThis mass of snow and ice does not remain stationary, as might\r\nbe expected from its apparent solidity. Under the influence of\r\nits own weight and of alternations of heat and cold, it flows down\r\nthe incline like a very thick liquid. During the winter the ice\r\nmelts but little, and the movement is slow, but in the summer,\r\nunder the influence of the warm days and cool nights, both the\r\nmelting and the rate of flow of the ice are increased. A moving\r\nbody of snow and ice of this sort is called a \"glacier.\" It creeps\r\ndown the mountain slope and into some canon, until, in the warmer\r\nair of the lower mountains, the rate of advance is exactly balanced\r\nby the rate of melting at the lower end of the mass. The glaciers\r\nin the United States are at present comparatively small, but once\r\nthese icy masses stretched over the mountains and lowlands of a\r\nlarge portion of the continent.\r\n\r\nIn the southern Sierra Nevada mountains no permanent snow exists\r\nbelow an elevation of about eleven thousand feet, but as we go\r\nnorth snow-fields are found lower and lower, until in the fiords\r\nof Alaska enormous glaciers reach down to the sea.\r\n\r\nA glacier worthy of our study may be found upon the Three Sisters,\r\na group of lofty and picturesque volcanic mountains rising from\r\nthe summit of the Cascade Range in central Oregon. There is a deep\r\ndepression between two of the peaks, which slopes down to the north\r\nand is thus particularly well adapted to catch and retain the drifting\r\nsnows. Consequently the glacier to which it gives rise is of exceptional\r\nsize, being nearly three miles long and half a mile wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--THE THREE SISTERS, FROM THE NORTH\r\n\r\nShowing snow-fields and glacier. Fields of recent lava appear in\r\nthe foreground]\r\n\r\nThe easiest path to the Three Sisters is by way of the McKenzie\r\nRiver from Eugene, Oregon. The McKenzie is a noted stream and one\r\nof the most beautiful in the state. The river courses through dense\r\nforests, and its clear, cold water is filled with trout. So tempestuous\r\nis the weather about the Cascade range that July is almost the only\r\nmonth in which one can visit the Three Sisters without danger of\r\nbeing caught in severe storms.\r\n\r\nThe traveller leaves the river a few miles above McKenzie Bridge,\r\nwhere a small tributary known as Lost Creek joins it. Lost Creek\r\nflows under the lava from a lake near the Three Sisters, while\r\nanother stream, coming from the glacier of which we are in search,\r\nflows down the same valley upon the surface of the lava and almost\r\ndirectly over the hidden stream.\r\n\r\nUpon the summit of the Cascade Range the dense forests of the river\r\nvalley give place to more open woods interspersed with park-like\r\nmeadows. A few miles away to the south rise the volcanic peaks of\r\nthe Three Sisters, clear and cold in the mountain air, wrapt about\r\nwith a mantle of white except where the slopes are too precipitous\r\nto hold the snow.\r\n\r\nAn indistinct trail leads through the tamarack forest and over a\r\nfield of rugged lava to the base of the peaks. Here we come upon\r\na swiftly flowing stream of a strange milky color. This appearance\r\nis due to the presence of fine mud, the product of the work of the\r\nglacier at the head of the stream as it slowly and with mighty\r\npower grinds away the surface of the rocks over which it moves.\r\nWherever one meets a stream of this kind, he will probably be safe\r\nin asserting that it is fed by a glacier upon some distant mountain\r\npeak.\r\n\r\nThis little stream, the course of which we must follow to reach\r\nthe glacier, is choked with sand and pebbles brought to it by the\r\nmoving ice. These are not ordinary stream pebbles, for they have\r\nstrangely flattened sides which often show scratches, and look as\r\nif they had been ground off against a grindstone. They are the\r\ntools with which the ice does its work. The ice block takes up\r\nthe rock fragments which fall upon its surface or which it tears\r\nfrom beneath, and carries them along, grinding every surface which\r\nit touches. The fragments are dropped at the end of the glacier,\r\nand the smaller pebbles are washed away down the stream that flows\r\nfrom the melting ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--GLACIER ON THE THREE SISTERS]\r\n\r\nWe follow up the little glacial creek, past icy snow-banks and\r\nthrough groves of fir trees where the warm sunshine brings out\r\nthe resinous odors. Upon one side of the canon there lies a field\r\nof black lava which not many hundreds of years ago forced this\r\nglacial creek from an earlier channel into its present bed. Now\r\nwe come upon what appears at first to be a snow-bank lying across\r\nthe course of the stream, and from beneath which its waters issue.\r\nDeep cracks in the outer mass of snow show the clear, pale-green\r\nice below. This is the lower end of the glacier which we have been\r\nso long a time in reaching.\r\n\r\nA short climb up a steep slope brings us to the top of the glacier.\r\nIt forms a perfectly even plain, extending back with a gentle slope\r\nto the head of a deep notch between the two northern Sisters, while\r\nabove and beyond rise the steeper snow-fields, from which this\r\nice is continually renewed.\r\n\r\nThe glacier does not terminate in the usual manner, with a stream\r\nflowing from its centre, for the outlet is at one side, while the\r\nmiddle abuts against a low mound of rock. This mound we find most\r\ninteresting, for upon reaching its top we look down into a volcanic\r\ncrater. From this crater flowed the great stream of lava to which\r\nwe have already referred. The lava ran downward, bending this way\r\nand that among the hollows, until it spread nearly to the McKenzie\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nDuring the Glacial period, before the eruption took place, this\r\nglacier was much larger. The summit of the Cascade Range was then\r\ncovered by glaciers. This fact we know from the presence of grooved\r\nand polished rocks wherever the surface has not been worn away\r\nor covered with newer lava. The Glacial period had passed away\r\nand the climate had become much the same as it now is when the\r\nvolcanic forces broke out at the spot where the crater is situated.\r\nThe eruption undoubtedly melted the ice in the vicinity, but after\r\nit had ceased and the rocks had become cold, the glacier never gained\r\nstrength enough to push the loose materials of the volcanic cone out\r\nof its path. The ice banked up snugly against the obstruction, and\r\nas it melted the water found its way out at the side of the lava.\r\n\r\nAlthough the surface of the glacier appears at first to offer an\r\neasy route to the higher mountain slopes, yet there are numerous\r\nhidden crevices into which one may fall. The safest arrangement\r\nis to tie a company of people together with a stout rope, so that\r\nif one falls into a crevice the rope will save him. Toward the\r\nmiddle of the glacier the ice becomes so badly fissured that it is\r\nnecessary to turn toward the right margin. There are two sets of\r\nthese fissures, one parallel to the direction in which the glacier\r\nis moving, the other at right angles. They are due to the strain\r\nto which the ice is subjected as it moves along at an uneven rate\r\nand over a surface composed of hollows and ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--MORAINE AT THE END OF THE GLACIER]\r\n\r\nLeaving the glacier, we climb upon a long low ridge of gravel and\r\nboulders mixed with fragments of ice. The fragments of rock which\r\nhave fallen upon the surface of the ice or been torn from the rock\r\nover which it is moving, have been heaped up along its sides somewhat\r\nas a ridge of snow is raised along each side of the course of a\r\nsnow-plough. Such a ridge of debris along the side of a glacier\r\nis known as a marginal moraine. A similar ridge, formed by the\r\naccumulation of rock fragments at the lower end of the glacier,\r\nis a terminal moraine. These ridges and hollows formed by the ice\r\nare found all over the northern portion of the United States. The\r\nhollows once filled with ice are now occupied by the beautiful\r\nlakes of this portion of our country.\r\n\r\nAs we climb along the moraine at the margin of the glacier, many\r\nopenings appear in the clear green ice. There is the sound of gurgling\r\nwaters, and occasionally pieces of ice and rock fall into dimly\r\noutlined caverns which are narrow at the top, but far below widen\r\nout to the proportion of chambers.\r\n\r\nAfter the head of the glacier is attained there is still a hard\r\nclimb over the snow-fields, which extend upward so far that they\r\nseem to have no end. When at last the gap between the peaks is\r\ngained we are completely tired out. The summit of the middle Sister\r\nrising directly above us is still a thousand feet higher, but there\r\nis not time to-day to reach it.\r\n\r\nA magnificent vista is spread out upon every hand. Extending north\r\nand south along the crest of the Cascade Range there is a line\r\nof sharp snowy peaks with summer clouds floating about them. How\r\nthese peaks contrast with the dark blue of the surrounding forests!\r\nOpposite us, upon the south, is the third Sister, white with snow\r\nfrom top to bottom, while in the basin between this peak and the\r\nridge on which we are standing lie the remnants of a once mighty\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to return. The cold, foggy clouds are hiding the\r\nsummits and will soon envelop the spot where we stand. We go down\r\nby a different path, but over almost continuous snow-fields, for\r\nmore than two miles. The return is much easier than the ascent,\r\nalthough if one lost his footing upon some steep slope, it would\r\nmean a long slide or tumble. The solid earth is reached without\r\naccident. What a relief to have some firm hold for the feet again!\r\nClimbing over a field of rough lava is easier than toiling through\r\nsoft snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--A BOULDER LEFT BY A GLACIER]\r\n\r\nThe region about the Three Sisters is just as nature left it, for\r\nthe home of the nearest settler is many miles away. Although now\r\nit has few visitors, this country will become attractive when its\r\nwonderful volcanic and glacial phenomena are better known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND MOUNTAIN BUILDING\r\n\r\nOur everyday experiences lead us to feel that nothing is more permanent\r\nthan the features of the earth upon which we live. Great cities\r\ncontaining costly buildings are built by the water's edge with the\r\nexpectation that the ocean will remain where it is. The building\r\nof railroads and canals, and the establishment of industries to make\r\nthe earth more fruitful and better adapted to our use, are based\r\nupon the idea that the mountains and valleys with their various,\r\nclimates will not change.\r\n\r\nThe study of history, however, makes plain the fact that at different\r\ntimes in the past certain portions of the earth have been visited by\r\ndestructive changes. Cities have been shaken down by earthquakes, and\r\nthe ocean has swept in over the land, drowning thousands of people.\r\nEven the mountains, which stand upon broad and firm foundations,\r\nsometimes bring disaster, by means of avalanches and land-slides,\r\nto the people who live at their bases.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the earth's surface is everywhere slowly and\r\nquietly changing; but our lives are so short, and the history of\r\neven the oldest cities is so brief in comparison with the rate at\r\nwhich most of the changes take place, that we as a rule are aware\r\nof only the uncommon and sudden ones.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of earthquakes establishes the unmistakable fact\r\nthat there are forces at work from within disturbing the surface,\r\nwhile land-slides, and even little gullies washed out by the rain,\r\nshow that other forces are working from without.\r\n\r\nThe vibration or trembling of the earth which we call an \"earthquake\"\r\nalways arouses alarm, and frequently occasions great destruction\r\nand loss of life. Only a few of the various causes that may bring\r\nabout earthquakes are as yet fully understood. Earthquakes are\r\nvery interesting, however, because they are often associated with\r\nthe birth and growth of lofty mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nVolcanic eruptions, hot springs, and the high temperature which\r\nexists toward the bottom of deep mines show us that the interior\r\nof the earth is very hot. It is thought that at one time the whole\r\nearth glowed with heat, but as ages passed it became cold upon\r\nthe outside and a solid crust was formed.\r\n\r\nEvery one has observed that fruit becomes wrinkled as the pulp\r\nwithin dries and contracts. The materials of the earth occupy more\r\nspace when they are hot than when cold, and as the interior portion\r\nis still cooling, the outer layer or crust continues to shrink down\r\nupon it, forming folds or wrinkles, as in the case of the skin of\r\nan apple.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no portion of the surface that is fixed in its\r\npresent position. The land is either rising or sinking continually.\r\nIf the area that is pushed upward is large, it becomes a plateau;\r\nbut if long and narrow like a wrinkle, it forms a mountain range.\r\nWe should not be aware of these movements in many cases if it were\r\nnot for the horizontal shelf cut upon the borders of the land by the\r\nocean waves. Along some coasts old wave-cut cliffs stand hundreds\r\nof feet above the present ocean level. Other coasts have sunk,\r\nso that the water has flooded the adjoining land and made a new\r\nshore line.\r\n\r\nWhen the movements of the land are sudden, they manifest themselves\r\nto us through earthquakes. The crust of the earth is not so flexible\r\nas the skin of an apple, and when the strain upon it becomes too\r\ngreat it suddenly breaks. The rock walls usually slide past one\r\nanother along such a fracture. If the rising wall becomes high\r\nenough it will form a mountain range.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain systems border the oceans, for the lines of\r\nweakness occur where the land dips steeply down beneath the water.\r\nIt sometimes happens that the fractures in the rocks where mountains\r\nare being made are situated underneath the water, or in some position\r\nwhere water passes down through them in large quantities.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think would happen if such an underground stream of\r\nwater came in contact with hot or molten rocks far below the surface?\r\nNote the effect produced by drops of water falling upon a hot stove.\r\nEach one, as it strikes, is partly changed to steam with a slight\r\nexplosive sound. The result is similar when water is turned into\r\nthe hot and nearly empty boiler of a steam-engine--an explosion\r\nis sure to follow.\r\n\r\nWhen the pressure of steam suddenly formed within the earth is\r\ntoo great, a volcanic explosion takes place at some point where\r\nthe overlying rocks are weakest, probably on or near one of the\r\nlines of fracture about which we have been speaking. The explosion\r\nis accompanied by thundering noises, tremblings of the earth, and\r\nthe hurling of rock and molten lava into the air. That the rocks\r\nof the earth's crust are elastic is shown by the rebounding of a\r\npebble thrown against a large boulder. If a file be drawn across\r\nthe edge of a sheet of tin upon which sand has been sprinkled, the\r\ntin vibrates over its whole extent, as is shown by the jumping\r\nof the sand grains. Because of like elasticity in the materials\r\nwhich make up the surface of the earth, the vibrations produced\r\nby an explosion are carried through the solid earth for hundreds\r\nof miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--EARTHQUAKE FISSURES NEAR MONO LAKE, CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nThe records of earthquakes show that they are much more violent and\r\noccur oftener where the crust of the earth is being disturbed by\r\nfolding. We have seen that there are two main causes of earthquakes:\r\nthe slipping of portions of the earth past each other along a fissure,\r\nand the contact of water with very hot rocks far below the surface.\r\nIt is probable that the earthquakes which occur so often in the\r\nwestern portion of the United States are due to the first of these\r\ncauses. The numerous extinct volcanoes show that at one period\r\nthis region was frequently shaken by explosive eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--THE WASATCH RANGE\r\n\r\nFrom Salt Lake City]\r\n\r\nMono Lake (see Fig. 42, page 99), at the eastern base of the Sierra\r\nNevada Range, has been a centre for explosive eruptions, which\r\nwere extremely violent at one time. The islands which rise in the\r\nlake are shattered, while Black Point, upon the northern shore,\r\nhas been uplifted by an explosion from beneath, which split the\r\nrocks apart and formed deep fissures.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that in the Cordilleran region the mountains\r\nhave been increasing in height in very recent years. We might almost\r\nsay that they are growing to-day. In this region, then, we can\r\nactually see how mountains are made; we do not have to depend upon\r\ndescriptions of the manner in which they are supposed to have been\r\nmade thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--BLUFF FORMED BY AN EARTHQUAKE\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Wasatch Range, Utah]\r\n\r\nAny good map will show that the mountains of the Cordilleran region\r\nhave in general a north and south direction. Their direction was\r\ndetermined by fissures formed long ago in the crust of the earth.\r\nMovements have continued to take place along many of these fissures\r\nup to the present time, and probably will continue for some time\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nIn order to become better acquainted with these remarkable mountains,\r\nlet us examine some of them, taking first the Wasatch Range in\r\neastern Utah. The range has an elevation of nearly eleven thousand\r\nfeet, rising gradually upon the eastern side, but presenting a bold\r\nand picturesque front upon the west, toward the plain of Great\r\nSalt Lake. A short drive from Salt Lake City brings us to the foot\r\nof the range, at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canon.\r\n\r\nA peculiar bluff which extends for a number of miles along the\r\nbase of the mountains at once attracts our attention. The steep\r\nface of the bluff, which is from fifty to seventy-five feet high,\r\nappears to have been formed by a rising of the land upon the side\r\nnext the mountains, or a dropping upon the valley side. There are\r\nreasons for believing that the formation of the bluff was due to\r\nthe occurrence of an earthquake some time within the last century.\r\nThe bluff is closely related to the mighty mountains behind it. It\r\nwas formed by the last of a series of movements in the earth which\r\nraised the great block known as the Wasatch Range to an elevation\r\nof six thousand feet above the plains at its base. Is it to be\r\nwondered at that disturbances of the earth which result in the\r\nerection of mountains of such height are frequently so severe as\r\nto destroy the strongest buildings?\r\n\r\nNow let us go westward across the various parallel ranges of the\r\nGreat Basin to Owens Valley at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada\r\nmountains. This is the highest and longest continuous mountain range\r\nin the United States. For a distance of more than one hundred miles\r\nits elevation is from twelve thousand to over fourteen thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--EASTERN FACE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nFormed by a great fracture in the earth's crust]\r\n\r\nOwens Valley was in 1872 the centre of one of the most severe and\r\nextensive earthquakes ever recorded in the United States. The little\r\nvillage of Lone Pine, situated in the valley below Mount Whitney,\r\nwas utterly demolished, twenty people were killed and many injured.\r\nA portion of the valley near the village sank so low that the water\r\nflowed in and formed a lake above it. The land was so shaken up\r\nthat the fields of one man were thrust into those of his neighbor.\r\nFor a distance of several hundred miles to the north along the base\r\nof the mountains the earth was fractured, and bluffs from ten to\r\nforty feet high were formed as a result either of the dropping of\r\nthe surface of the valley upon the eastern side, or of the raising\r\nof the mountains upon the west.\r\n\r\nThis slipping of the earth which gave rise to the earthquake bluffs\r\nwas the most recent of a long series of similar events which have\r\nraised the precipitous eastern wall of the Sierra Nevada mountains\r\nto a height of two miles above Owens Valley. If you will go out\r\ninto the centre of the valley and look west toward the mountains,\r\nyou will see three bluffs or scarps. The first, which is twenty\r\nfeet high, was made at the time of the last earthquake; the second,\r\nknown as the Alabama Hills and rising about four hundred feet, was\r\nformed at an earlier time; the third, rising back of the others,\r\nis that of the main Sierra.\r\n\r\nSimilar cliffs appear at the bases of other ranges of mountains\r\nin the Great Basin. Springs abound along these fractures in the\r\nearth, for the surface waters have an opportunity to collect wherever\r\nthe rocks are broken. Numerous fertile valleys mark the line of\r\nearthquake movements, for the broken rocks and abundant springs\r\nfavor rapid erosion.\r\n\r\nAmong the Coast Ranges of California there appears a series of\r\nfractures in the earth which form a line nearly four hundred miles\r\nlong. They extend from a point near San Bernardino in a northwesterly\r\ndirection to the neighborhood of San Francisco. Severe earthquakes\r\nhave taken place along this line since the country was settled.\r\nThe pressure and grinding of the earth upon opposite sides of the\r\nfissures has formed long low ridges of earth. Small valleys have\r\nbeen blocked, and the old stage road from Los Angeles to Bakersfield,\r\nwhich followed the course of the fissures for a number of miles,\r\nhas been almost obliterated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--ELIZABETH LAKE, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nOccupying a valley primarily due to earthquake movements]\r\n\r\nHundreds of cliffs and mountain scarps throughout the West have\r\ncome into existence as the results of movements such as we have been\r\ndescribing. Where the disturbances have been recent the mountains\r\nare bold and picturesque. Those produced in earlier times are in many\r\ninstances so worn away that it is difficult to tell with certainty\r\nhow they were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThere are more volcanoes in our country than is generally supposed.\r\nSome are very small and some rank among the greatest of mountain\r\npeaks, but all together there are many hundreds, perhaps thousands,\r\nof them. At present they are all silent and apparently dead. We\r\nare accustomed to speak of them as extinct volcanoes, but of this\r\nwe must not be too sure.\r\n\r\nThey stand dark and cold, giving no clue to the nature of the forces\r\nwhich made them, except perhaps by the presence of an occasional hot\r\nspring and the appearance of the rocks of which they are composed.\r\nThe slag-like character of these rocks we have learned to associate\r\nwith intense heat. Some of these volcanoes are very old and have\r\nbeen nearly worn away; others are new and almost as perfect as\r\nwhen they were first made.\r\n\r\nWhere shall we go to find these volcanoes? Are there any upon the\r\nAtlantic coast or neighboring highlands? Though you may travel\r\nover all that portion of our country, you will find none, although\r\nyou will discover in places, as for instance in the palisades of\r\nthe Hudson, lavas which came from very ancient volcanoes, worn\r\ndown so long ago that their very sites are lost to view.\r\n\r\nIf we search the Mississippi basin we find there even fewer traces\r\nof volcanic action than upon the eastern highlands. The greater\r\nportion of the vast area embraced by the Mississippi River and its\r\ntributaries has had a very uneventful history, although at times\r\nearthquakes may have occurred and the sky may have been darkened\r\nby ashes from eruptions in distant parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--FISSURE IN THE LAVA, SHADOW MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nThe groovings in the lava show that it was squeezed out in a half-solid\r\ncondition]\r\n\r\nIt is in the country west of the Rockies, the region last to be\r\nexplored and settled, that the objects of our search come to light.\r\nHere are volcanoes and lava fields so extensive as almost to bury\r\nfrom sight the older surface of the earth. Some of them appear\r\nas if but yesterday they had been glowing with heat.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordilleran region Nature has carried on her work with a\r\nmaster hand. She has lifted the earth's crust to form a great plateau.\r\nPortions of the plateau she has broken, projecting the fragments\r\nupward to form lofty mountains, while along the fissures thus created\r\nshe has squeezed out fiery molten matter from the interior of the\r\nearth. This molten material has spread out in fields of lava or\r\nhas piled itself about small openings, forming volcanic cones,\r\nwhich in some cases have overtopped the loftiest mountain ranges\r\nof the continent. It is believed that a number of these volcanic\r\neruptions have occurred in the Cordilleran region of the United\r\nStates since the discovery of America, and that one took place\r\nwithin the lifetime of many persons now living.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco Mountain, in northern Arizona, is the loftiest volcanic\r\npeak of a region dotted with volcanoes and lava flows. This great\r\nvolcano, like most of its neighbors, has long been extinct, although\r\na few miles to the eastward there appears a group of small but\r\nvery new cones.\r\n\r\nA ride of fifteen miles from the town of Flagstaff, across the\r\nforest-covered plateau, brings us to Shadow Mountain and the fields\r\nof lava and volcanic sand lying at its base. The mountain, throughout\r\nits height of over one thousand feet, is a conical aggregate of\r\nloose lapilli which give way under the feet and make climbing the\r\npeak very tiresome.\r\n\r\nThe lapilli and scoriae are slag-like fragments of lava which have\r\nbeen blown out of the throat of the volcano while in a hot or\r\nsemi-molten condition. These fragments, as they fall back to the\r\nearth, collect about the opening and in time build up the volcano,\r\nor cinder cone, as such a mountain is frequently called. The finer\r\nparticles, which have the appearance of dark sand, fall farther\r\naway and form a layer over the surface for some miles upon every\r\nside. These products of an explosive volcano are sometimes called\r\ncinders and ashes, because of their resemblance to the slag and\r\nrefuse of furnaces.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the volcano which we are studying, the lapilli are\r\nso black that they give the cone the appearance of being darkened\r\nby the shadow of a cloud, and on this account the peak is named\r\nShadow Mountain. As the days are usually bright here, the shadow\r\neffect is very striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--EDGE OF LAVA FIELD, WITH PUMICE IN THE\r\nFOREGROUND\r\n\r\nNear Shadow Mountain]\r\n\r\nThere are several smaller craters, east of the main one, which\r\nalso threw out volcanic sand and lapilli. The surrounding hills are\r\nof volcanic origin, although very much older than Shadow Mountain.\r\nThese hills are covered with pine forests; but trees or plants\r\nhave gained only slight hold upon the newer surfaces of the cinder\r\ncones, which present a picture of almost complete desolation.\r\n\r\nThere have been two other eruptions since the making of the cinder\r\ncones, and these were marked by flows of molten lava. Although\r\nthe rough and rugged surface of the older flow has not yet begun\r\nto crumble and form soil, as it must do in time, yet a few trees\r\nare found here and there, reaching their roots down for the scanty\r\nnourishment to be drawn from the crevices of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe last flow of lava, which was very small, ran into a depression\r\nin the other flow just described. This lava appears so fresh that\r\nwe almost expect to find the rocks still warm. What a contrast\r\nbetween the wooded hillside adjoining, with its carpet of soft\r\nvolcanic sand, and the jagged surface of the lava! Care must be\r\ntaken in climbing over the lava, for the sharp points and angles\r\nare ever ready to tear one's shoes and hands. It cannot be many\r\nyears since these hard, cold rocks formed a glowing mass of molten\r\nmatter creeping quietly out of some hidden fissure which reached\r\nfar down into the earth. The lava hardened as it became cold, just\r\nas does molten iron when led from the furnace to make a casting.\r\n\r\nAt one spot in the lava field stand the remains of rude stone houses\r\nbuilt into caverns in the lava. About them are scattered pieces\r\nof broken pottery. These rude dwellings were probably occupied by\r\nsome of the prehistoric people whose homes are also found along\r\nmany of the streams, and in the caves of the plateau region. We\r\ncan see no reason for their coming to this desolate place, so far\r\nfrom a water supply, unless it was that the rugged lava offered\r\nsome protection from their enemies.\r\n\r\nNow let us imagine ourselves transported to northern California.\r\nNear Lassen Peak, the southernmost of the great volcanoes of the\r\nCascade Range, there lies another field of recent volcanic activity\r\nof even greater interest than the first. The centre of attraction is\r\nCinder Cone, similar to Shadow Mountain in its manner of formation\r\nas well as in materials, but more symmetrical in form. Upon one side\r\nis a field of black lava several miles in extent, while volcanic\r\nsand has been spread over all the adjacent country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--THE CRATER OF CINDER CONE]\r\n\r\nAs nearly as can be determined, only a little more than two hundred\r\nyears ago the valley now occupied by Cinder Cone and the lava fields\r\ngave no indication of ever becoming a new centre of volcanic action.\r\nIt has been thousands of years since the ancient volcanic peaks\r\nand cinder cones of this mountainous region became extinct. The\r\nglaciers had come, and torn and ground away the surface of the\r\nlava, and afterward dense forests had hidden all the rocky slopes,\r\nwhile lakes had occupied many of the valleys. Far below, however,\r\nthe fires had not gone out. In many places there were boiling springs\r\nfrom which the steam, upon cold mornings, rose in dense white clouds.\r\n\r\nThen, for some reason which we do not understand, the forces beneath\r\nthe surface increased their activity. The force of the steam and\r\nother gases was too great to be restrained, and at a weak spot in\r\nthe overlying rocks they broke through. Molten lava accompanied\r\nthem, and a new volcano came into life in the valley where Cinder\r\nCone now raises its dark, symmetrical slopes.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions were violent. With explosive force the molten lava\r\nwas torn into fragments, and sand, lapilli, and bombs were hurled out\r\ninto the air. The finer particles were carried by the air currents\r\nfar over the surrounding country. The lapilli, scoriae, and bombs\r\nfell around the throat of the volcano, finally building up the\r\ncone to its present proportions. The great bombs, some of them five\r\nfeet in diameter, are among the most remarkable products of this\r\neruption. They lie scattered about upon the surface of the ground\r\nat the foot of the cone, and, although they are often irregular\r\nin shape, they might almost be mistaken for huge cannon-balls.\r\nThe eruption killed and burned the trees in the near-by forests,\r\nburying them under six or seven feet of fine sand or ashes. After\r\nthe cone had been built and the explosive eruptions had nearly\r\nstopped, a stream of molten lava burst from the base of the cone\r\nand filled a portion of the valley.\r\n\r\nNow followed a long period of quiet. Trees began to grow upon the\r\nsand and gradually to encroach upon the barren wastes about Cinder\r\nCone. It appeared as if there were to be no more eruptions. But\r\nthe volcano was only resting. At about the time, perhaps, when\r\nthe gold seekers began to pour across the continent to California,\r\nthere was another eruption; but this time it took the form of a\r\nlava flow and was so quiet as to create no disturbance in the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--CINDER CONE\r\n\r\nThe trees were killed by the last eruption of volcanic ashes]\r\n\r\nA stream of thick, viscous lava flowed slowly out of an opening\r\nat the southern base of Cinder Cone. As the lava crept down the\r\ngentle slopes of the valley, it crusted over, forming a black,\r\nslag-like surface. The surface was from time to time broken up\r\nand mixed with the softer portions beneath, so that the movement\r\nof the flow was still further retarded. At the lower end of the\r\nvalley the lava occupied a portion of a body of water now known\r\nas Lake Bidwell; its rugged front made a dam across the valley\r\nabove, forming Snag Lake. The stumps of the trees which were killed\r\nby the water when the lake was first formed are still standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--THE LAST LAVA FLOW IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nAt Cinder Cone, California. It formed a dam across a valley, thus\r\ncreating Snag Lake]\r\n\r\nOne's feet sink deep into volcanic sands, and walking is tiresome.\r\nThe lava field resulting from the last eruption is free from sand,\r\nbut its rough surface, formed of broken blocks, is difficult to\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nA few charred stumps rise out of the sand, pathetic remnants of the\r\nforest trees that were growing at the time of the first eruption.\r\nMost of the trees have completely disappeared, leaving shallow\r\npits where they once stood.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult to climb the cone, which rises over\r\nsix hundred feet, for the slopes, composed of loose lapilli, are\r\nso steep that one slips back at every step nearly as far as he\r\nadvances. From the summit a remarkable sight meets the eye. Within\r\nthe rim of the main crater is a second crater with a rim nearly as\r\nhigh as the first, while the cavity within has a depth of about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\nBecause of the loose character of the material of which it is built,\r\nno streamlets have yet worn channels down the slopes of Cinder\r\nCone, and except for the presence of two small bushes which cling\r\nto its side, it is just as bare and perfect in form as when first\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the forests are encroaching upon the sand-covered\r\nslopes about the cone, and in time these slopes, the black fields\r\nof lava, and the cone itself, will be covered with forests like\r\nthe older lava fields and cinder cones which appear upon every\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUD VOLCANOES OF THE COLORADO DESERT\r\n\r\nThe Colorado Desert is a strange, weird region. Here is a vast\r\nbasin at the head of the Gulf of California which was once a part of\r\nthe gulf, but is now separated from it by the delta of the Colorado\r\nRiver. With the drying up of the water, the centre of the basin was\r\nleft a salt marsh more than two hundred and fifty feet below the\r\nlevel of the ocean. In summer the air quivers under the blazing\r\nsun, and it seems as if no form of life could withstand the scorching\r\nheat, but in winter the atmosphere is cool and full of life-giving\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nAround this desert rise the mountains, some old and nearly worn\r\ndown, their tops barely rising out of the long slopes of sand and\r\ngravel; others rugged and steep, lifting their crests far above\r\nthe burning desert into the cold, clear sky.\r\n\r\nCurious forms of plants and animals find their homes upon the slopes\r\nabout the basin, where they adapt themselves to the heat and dryness.\r\nBut toward the centre the soil is bare clay, for when the water dried\r\nup so much alkali and salt were left that nothing could grow.\r\n\r\nHowever we do not now intend to study the plants or the animals,\r\ninteresting though they are, but rather a group of mud volcanoes,\r\nwhich forms almost the only relief in the monotony of the bare\r\nplain. These volcanoes are in no way related to real volcanoes\r\nexcept in shape, for water and mud, instead of fire and lava, have\r\nbeen concerned in their building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--MUD VOLCANOES, COLORADO DESERT]\r\n\r\nOnce it required a long journey in wagons or upon horseback to reach\r\nthe mud volcanoes, but now the railroad takes us within three miles\r\nof the spot. We alight from the train before a section house which\r\nstands in the midst of the great desert. Far, far away stretches the\r\nbarren clay floor of the ancient lake. Here and there are scattered\r\nstunted shrubs, the only specimens of plant life which have been\r\nable to withstand the alkali in the clay.\r\n\r\nSeen from the station, the volcanoes appear like dark specks almost\r\nupon the horizon, but in reality they are not far away, and an\r\nhour's brisk walk will bring us to them. The mud springs, which\r\nare scattered over an area of several hundred acres, present many\r\nstrange and interesting features. There are holes in the earth with\r\nbubbling mud at the bottom, cones from the tops of which streams\r\nof muddy water issue, and ponds of mud, in some cases as thick\r\nas molasses, in others thin and watery. There are little jets of\r\nsteam, strange odors, and a vista of many mingled colors. Taken\r\naltogether, it is a place quite different from any other that we\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe ground is soft and marshy, and in some places undermined by\r\nthe water, so that we have to take great care in walking about.\r\nSome of the smaller springs occupy round depressions, sometimes\r\nthree or four feet across, which look as if they had been made\r\nby pressing a large pan down into the clay. The bubbling mud in\r\nthe bottom of the pan, as well as the hot water in many of the\r\nsprings, makes it easy to imagine that we are standing upon the\r\ntop of a great cooking stove in which a hot fire is burning. As\r\nthe gas with which the water is impregnated comes up through the\r\nmud, it forms huge bubbles which finally break and settle down,\r\nonly to rise again. In this way concentric mud rings, perfect in\r\nform, are made to cover the entire surface of the pool.\r\n\r\nWhere there is little water, the surface of the mud hardens and\r\nleaves a small opening, through which the bubbling gas throws small\r\ncolumns of mud at regular intervals. From the large pools, some\r\nof which are forty to fifty feet in diameter, there comes a low\r\nmurmuring sound like the boiling of many kettles. The water is\r\nsputtering and bubbling, and in some places it is hot enough to give\r\noff thin clouds of steam. Occasionally we get whiffs of sulphur,\r\nwhile about the borders of some of the ponds pretty crystals of\r\nthis mineral can be found.\r\n\r\nMore commonly the pools are crusted about with a white deposit\r\nof salt, for they all contain more or less of this substance in\r\nsolution. Around a few of the pools the mud is stained with the\r\nred tinge of iron, and red lines mark the paths of the streams\r\nas they run off from the pools toward the still lower portions of\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--POT-HOLES]\r\n\r\nThe built-up cones or volcanoes appear in every stage, from the\r\nlittle ones a few inches high to the patriarchs, which in some\r\ncases have reached a height of twelve feet. These cones are formed\r\nby the hardening and piling up of mud about the openings; but when\r\nthey have reached the height mentioned, the passages up through\r\ntheir centres, corresponding in each case to the throat of a real\r\nvolcano, become clogged and new holes are formed in the mud at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--AN EXTINCT MUD VOLCANO\r\n\r\nWith small active one at its side]\r\n\r\nMany of these mud volcanoes closely resemble true volcanoes in form\r\nand structure. The mud which pours out at the top forms streams\r\ndown the slopes very like those of molten lava. New cones are built\r\nupon the sides or at the bases of the old ones in much the same\r\nway as are those in the volcanic regions.\r\n\r\nThere are no signs of volcanic action in the vicinity of these mud\r\nsprings, and it is likely that the water is forced to the surface\r\nby large quantities of gas produced by chemical changes taking\r\nplace deep within the clay beds of the old lake. Similar springs\r\noccur farther south, nearer the mouth of the Colorado River, in\r\nthe Yellowstone Park, and near Lassen Peak, but nowhere in America\r\nexcept in the Colorado desert have they formed such large and\r\ninteresting mounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF A COAST LINE\r\n\r\nThe story of our Pacific coast reads more like a tale from the\r\n\"Arabian Nights\" than like a plain statement of events which have\r\nactually happened.\r\n\r\nThe meeting place of the land and ocean is not really so permanent\r\na line as it appears. The shore has been continually moving back\r\nand forth throughout the long history of the earth. That which was\r\ndry land at one time was at another time deeply buried beneath the\r\nocean. The Pacific border seems never to have been at rest. It has\r\nrisen and sunk again repeatedly. It has been squeezed, folded, and\r\nbroken, shaken by earthquakes, and disturbed by volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nOne might be led to think from this statement that it would not\r\nbe safe to live on the Pacific coast, and that both animals and\r\nmen would shun the region. The fact is, however, that these changes\r\nusually come to pass so very slowly that we are not aware of them.\r\nSevere earthquakes and volcanic disturbances take place so rarely\r\nin comparison with the length of a man's life, that we may pass our\r\nwhole lives without experiencing any of these violent disturbances.\r\nThe Pacific coast region, with its forest-covered mountains, fertile\r\nvalleys, and beautiful homes, presents so quiet and peaceful an\r\nappearance that it is difficult to believe that parts of its history\r\nhave been so tumultuous.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will ask how we can know so much about the past. It is\r\ntrue that no one was here to witness the events which are supposed\r\nto have taken place. But Nature has left a record of her doings\r\nwhich we have only to see and understand in order to learn with\r\ncertainty many things which happened in the far distant past.\r\n\r\nToo many of us go through life seeing and understanding almost\r\nas little of the world about us as if we were blind. Our early\r\nancestors were obliged to understand many things about Nature and\r\nto cultivate clear and close observation for the sake of\r\nself-preservation. The very life of the savage depends upon the\r\ntraining of his eyes. He must be able to tell the meaning of a\r\ndistant object or an indistinct trail, for his enemies may have\r\npassed that way recently. If we could bring the sharp eyes of the\r\nsavage to our aid, the world would mean much more to us.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn something of the history of the Pacific shore\r\nline, we must see what the waves are doing at the present time.\r\nThe projecting points of land are being worn away (Fig. 33). The\r\nwaves form the cliffs against which they beat, and sometimes, as\r\nthey eat their way slowly into the land, they cut off portions\r\nand leave them standing alone as islands.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles and boulders (Fig. 34) were once angular fragments\r\ntorn from the cliff. They have been washed about and hurled against\r\nthe solid rock until they have been worn smooth; and the cliff\r\nin turn has had a cave ground out at its base. Above the lower\r\ncave there is a remnant of a second one, with pebbles upon its\r\nfloor. This was made when the land stood ten feet lower than at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAs the waves wear away the loose earth and the solid rock below\r\nit, moving the cliffs inland, they leave a comparatively smooth\r\nsurface which is partly exposed at low tide. The fact that this\r\nsurface is not marked by stream channels, as is the land, helps\r\nus to realize the great difference between the irregular surface\r\nof the latter and the plain-like character of the ocean floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--POINT BUCHON, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nThe waves are eating their way into the land]\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast of California there are many old sea beaches\r\nand cliffs which the waves abandoned long ago. The highest of these\r\nbeaches lies so far up the slopes of the mountains bordering the\r\nocean that it makes us wonder what the geography of California\r\ncould have been like when the region was so deeply submerged.\r\n\r\nThe lowest and newest terrace is the one shown in Fig. 35, ten\r\nfeet above the ocean. Each succeeding terrace is less distinct,\r\nand the highest, fourteen hundred feet in elevation, can now be\r\ndistinguished in only a few places. Where the old sea cliffs are\r\nbest preserved they form a series of broad, flat steps, rising one\r\nabove the other. Each bench, or terrace as it is commonly called,\r\nis a part of an old plain cut out of the land by the waves when the\r\nocean stood at that level. The steeper slope rising at the back is\r\nthe remnant of the cliff against which the waves used to beat. If\r\nwe are fortunate, we shall find at its base some water-worn pebbles\r\nand possibly a few fragments of sea-shells. The crumbling of the\r\nrocks and the erosive action of the rills are fast destroying the\r\nold cliffs, so that in many places they have entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--OCEAN CAVE AT LOW TIDE\r\n\r\nPebbles of a former beach are seen above]\r\n\r\nUpon the seaward face of San Pedro Hill, in southern California,\r\nthere are eleven terraces, rising to a height of twelve hundred\r\nfeet. What an interesting record this shows! Long ago the land\r\nstood twelve hundred feet lower than at present, and the waves beat\r\nabout San Pedro Hill, nearly submerging it. Then the land began\r\nto rise, but stopped after a time, and the waves cut a terrace. The\r\nupward movement was continued, with repeated intervals of rest,\r\nuntil the land stood higher than it does now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--WAVE-CUT TERRACES\r\n\r\nPoint San Pedro, California]\r\n\r\nNorth of San Francisco there stands a terrace fourteen hundred feet\r\nabove the ocean. Numerous terraces appear along the Oregon coast,\r\nbut those in Washington are not as high as those in California. It is\r\nprobable that the land in this region was not so deeply submerged.\r\n\r\nThe ancient shore lines of British Columbia and Alaska are now\r\ndeeply buried beneath the ocean, as those of California once were.\r\nThe fiords, so common in these countries, are old river valleys\r\nwhich have been drowned by the sinking of the land. The islands\r\nwere once portions of the coast mountains, but have been cut off\r\nby the same process.\r\n\r\nLet us picture in our minds the changes in the geography of the\r\nPacific coast of the United States which must have been made by a\r\nsinking of the land to a depth of only six hundred feet. We will\r\nbegin upon the north, at the Strait of Fuca.\r\n\r\nPuget Sound once opened to the south as well as to the north, so\r\nthat the Olympic Mountains formed an island. The broad and fertile\r\nWillamette Valley was but an arm of the sea, somewhat like Puget\r\nSound to-day. The body of water which once filled this valley has\r\nbeen called Willamette Sound. The ocean overspread the low Oregon\r\ncoast, and reached far up the valleys of the Umpqua and Rogue rivers.\r\nBut the boundaries of the Klamath Mountains were not greatly changed,\r\nfor in many places they rise quite abruptly from the present shore\r\nline.\r\n\r\nAll the large valleys of California were flooded, including the\r\nSan Joaquin-Sacramento valley, which was then a great sound, open\r\nto the ocean in the region of the present Strait of Carquinez.\r\nThe Coast range was broken up into islands and peninsulas. The\r\nislands off the coast of southern California are high and therefore\r\nwere not entirely submerged. The Gulf of California spread over the\r\nColorado Desert, while from the west the water penetrated inland\r\nover the plain of Los Angeles to a point beyond San Bernardino, so\r\nthat at the San Gorgonio pass only a narrow neck of land connected\r\nthe San Jacinto Mountains and the Peninsula Range with the mainland.\r\n\r\nIf California had been inhabited at this time, the state would\r\nnot have been noted for orchards and grain-fields, but rather for\r\nits mineral wealth. There would have been comparatively little\r\nlow land fit for cultivation, but the mountains, where almost all\r\nthe precious metals are found, would have appeared nearly as they\r\ndo to-day.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth may be divided into the ocean basins and\r\nthe continental masses which rise above them, but we must not make\r\nthe mistake of thinking that the shore line always corresponds\r\nwith the border of the continental masses. We have learned that\r\nthe land is almost always moving slowly up or down, so that the\r\nshore is continually changing back and forth. At one time the shore\r\nline may be far within the borders of the continent, as we have\r\nseen was once the case upon our Pacific coast; at another time,\r\nif the land should rise, the shore line might coincide with the\r\nreal border of the continent. By the real border of the continent\r\nwe mean the line along which the earth slopes down steeply to the\r\nabysmal depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that outside the present shore line of\r\nCalifornia there is a submerged strip of the continent varying\r\nfrom ten to one hundred and fifty miles in width. This strip of\r\nland is like a bench upon the side of the continent, and is known as\r\nthe continental plateau. The water over the plateau is comparatively\r\nshallow. Upon one side the land rises, while upon the other there is\r\na rapid descent into the deep Pacific. The surface of the plateau\r\nis in general fairly smooth, but in places mountains lift their\r\nsummits above the water and form islands.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, thousands of years earlier than the period when\r\nCalifornia was so nearly covered by the waters of the Pacific, when\r\nthis land stood far higher than it does now. The coast line was\r\nthen much farther west, near the border of the submarine plateau.\r\nThe Santa Barbara Islands at that time formed a mountain range upon\r\nthe edge of the continental land. This fact was established by\r\nthe discovery upon one of the islands of a large number of bones\r\nof an extinct American elephant. These animals could have reached\r\nthe submerged mountains only at a time when there was dry land\r\nbetween them and the present shore line. We should like to know how\r\nit came about that these bones were left where they are. Perhaps\r\nthe land sank so suddenly that the water cut the elephants off from\r\nthe mainland and compelled them to spend the remainder of their\r\nlives upon these islands.\r\n\r\nWhile the land stood so high, some of the larger streams wore deep\r\nchannels across what is now the submarine plateau. These channels\r\nhave been discovered by soundings made from the ships of the United\r\nStates Coast Survey. The largest of the submerged valleys extends\r\nthrough the Bay of Monterey, and runs so close to the shore that\r\nit has offered a favorable location for a wharf.\r\n\r\nBefore the buried valleys upon the northern coast of California\r\nwere all known, the presence of one of them led to the wreck of\r\na ship. The shore was obscured by fog, but the soundings made by\r\nthe sailors showed deep water and led them to believe they were\r\na long distance from land, when suddenly the ship drifted in upon\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nThe last significant movement of the land of the Pacific border\r\nwas a downward one. It flooded the mouths of the streams and formed\r\nall the large harbors which are of so great commercial importance.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco Bay occupies a great stretch of lowland at the meeting\r\nof several valleys of the Coast Ranges and forms the outlet for\r\nthe most important drainage system of California. If this region\r\nhad been settled before the subsidence of the land which let in the\r\nocean through the Golden Gate, how the farmers would have lamented\r\nthe flooding of their fertile lands! But we can understand how\r\nsmall the loss would have been, compared with the advantages to\r\nbe gained from the magnificent harbor which now exists here. If\r\nthe land had not sunk the history of the Pacific coast would have\r\nbeen far different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--ISLAND ROUNDED BY A GLACIER\r\n\r\nNear Anacortes, Puget Sound]\r\n\r\nPuget Sound, another very important arm of the ocean, is also a\r\nsubmerged valley, but it has had an entirely different history\r\nfrom that of San Francisco Bay. The valley was at one time occupied\r\nby a great glacier which came down from the Cascade Range and moved\r\nnorthwest through the sound and into the Strait of Juan de Fuca,\r\nscouring and polishing the rocks over which it passed. A little\r\nisland near Anacortes (Fig. 36) has been rounded by the action\r\nof the ice into a form like a whale's back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--AN ABANDONED OCEAN CLIFF\r\n\r\nSouthern California]\r\n\r\nThe sinking of the land flooded the lower Columbia River and the\r\nmouth of the Willamette, so that ocean ships may now go up as far\r\nas Portland. The currents and waves soon threw up bars across the\r\nmouths of the smaller streams, and formed lagoons behind them.\r\nShips frequently have difficulty in entering many of the harbors\r\nbecause of the sand bars which have been built up part way to the\r\nsurface of the water.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that along some portions of the coast there has recently\r\nbeen a slight upward movement of the land. Figure 37 shows a bit\r\nof California coast, near San Juan, where the Santa Fe railroad\r\nhas laid its tracks for several miles along a strip of abandoned\r\nbeach, at the base of a cliff against which the waves once beat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--LIMESTONE CLIFF, QUATSINO SOUND, VANCOUVER\r\nISLAND]\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of Vancouver island there is a deep arm of\r\nthe ocean called Quatsino Sound. A limestone cliff upon the shore\r\nof this sound (Fig. 38) has been undermined by the dissolving of\r\nthe limestone, but now the water lacks three feet of rising to\r\nthe notch which it recently formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER\r\n\r\nThe influence exerted by the various features of the land and water\r\nupon the settlement of a new region are not always fully appreciated.\r\nIf the entrance to San Francisco Bay had been broader and more\r\neasily discerned by the early navigators who sailed past it, and if\r\nthe mouth of the Columbia River had not been obscured by lowlands\r\nand a line of breakers upon the bar, the history of western America\r\nwould probably have been very different.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the prospect seemed to be that Spain\r\nwould control the Pacific Ocean. She claimed, by right of discovery,\r\nall the lands bordering upon this ocean and the exclusive right\r\nto navigate its waters. Every vessel found there without license\r\nfrom the court of Spain was, by royal decree, to be confiscated.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, after all these years and with our present knowledge,\r\nto look back and see how unreasonable were the claims of Spain.\r\nIn the fifteenth century the extent of the Pacific ocean was not\r\nknown. In fact, men's ideas as to the distribution of land and water\r\nover the earth were so indefinite that it was at first supposed\r\nthat the islands which Columbus discovered belonged to the East\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThe claims of Spain to the Pacific Ocean were based upon its discovery\r\nby Balboa, but she never made any serious efforts to enforce them,\r\nfor the attempt would have involved her in war with all the maritime\r\nnations of Europe. Spain lacked the ability to take advantage of\r\nthe great discoveries which her navigators and explorers had made,\r\nand for that reason she merely looked on, though with jealous eyes,\r\nwhen in the eighteenth century the ships of England, France, Holland,\r\nand Russia entered the Pacific Ocean with a view to exploration\r\nand conquest.\r\n\r\nDetermined at last to support their claim to the Pacific coast\r\nof North America, the Spaniards began to realize the necessity\r\nof exploring it more fully and of founding settlements. It was\r\ntheir plan to take possession of the whole region between Mexico\r\nupon the south and the Russian trading posts along the shores of\r\nAlaska. As exploration by land was impossible because of mountain\r\nranges and deserts, the Spanish adventurers were forced to rely\r\nupon the ocean, with all its uncertainties of storm and contrary\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nBetween 1774 and 1779 voyages were made as far north as Queen\r\nCharlotte's Island, in latitude 54 deg.. A station was established\r\nand held for many years at Nootka Sound, upon the west coast of\r\nVancouver Island. The first expedition passed the Strait of Juan\r\nde Fuca apparently without seeing it, although there was a rumor to\r\nthe effect that a broad opening into the land had been discovered\r\nby a certain Juan de Fuca in 1592, while he was exploring in the\r\nemploy of Spain. The latitude of this opening, as he gave it, nearly\r\ncorresponds to that of the strait which now bears his name.\r\n\r\nFor many years the attempt to discover a passage around the northern\r\npart of America engaged the early navigators upon both the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific oceans. Their desire to find an easy route to India\r\nspurred them to constant effort. For a time it was believed that\r\nsuch an opening actually existed, and mariners went so far as to give\r\nit a name, calling it the Straits of Anian. The reputed discoveries\r\nof Juan de Fuca materially strengthened the general belief in a\r\npassage to the northward of America.\r\n\r\nVizcaino, in his voyage of 1603, reached latitude 43 deg. north and\r\nthought that he had discovered a great river flowing into the Pacific\r\nOcean. This opening, although south of the point supposed to have\r\nbeen reached by Juan de Fuca, was believed for a time to be the\r\nentrance to the long-sought Straits of Anian. During the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth century California was represented upon\r\nthe Spanish maps as an island having Cape Blanco, which Vizcaino\r\ndiscovered and named, as its northern point, and separated from\r\nthe mainland by an extension of the Gulf of California northward.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the Spanish explorations, in the latter part of\r\nthe seventeenth century we find that Heceta, following the first\r\nexpedition, succeeded in getting as far as Vancouver Island, where,\r\nhaving been parted from an accompanying ship by a storm, he turned\r\nsouthward, passing the Strait of Juan de Fuca and keeping close by\r\nthe shore. In latitude 46 deg. 17' he found an opening in the coast from\r\nwhich a strong current issued. He felt sure that he had discovered\r\nthe mouth of some large river. Upon the later Spanish maps this\r\nwas called Heceta's Inlet, or River of San Roque. A glance at the\r\nmap will show how closely the latitude given corresponds to the\r\nmouth of the river which was discovered later by Captain Gray and\r\nnamed, after his ship, the Columbia.\r\n\r\nA short time before Heceta's discovery, Captain Jonathan Carver of\r\nConnecticut set out on an exploring tour, partly for the purpose\r\nof determining the width of the continent and the nature of the\r\nIndian inhabitants. He mentions four great rivers rising within\r\na few leagues of one another, \"The river Bourbon (Red River of\r\nthe North) which empties itself into Hudson's Bay, the waters of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, and the river Oregon, or River\r\nof the West, that falls into the Pacific Ocean at the Straits of\r\nAnian.\" Carver's descriptions are fanciful, and it is not likely that\r\nhe ever saw the river which is now known as the Columbia, although\r\nthere is a possibility that he heard stories from the Indians of\r\na great river upon the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and\r\ninvented for it the name Oregon.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Meares, an English trader, visited the coast, and sailing\r\nsouthward from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, attempted to find the\r\nriver San Roque as it was laid down upon the Spanish charts. Reaching\r\nthe proper latitude, Meares rounded a promontory and found behind\r\nit a bay which he was unable to enter because of a continuous line\r\nof breakers extending across it. He became satisfied that there\r\nwas no such river as the San Roque, and named the promontory Cape\r\nDisappointment and the bay Deception Bay. If Meares had entered\r\nthe bay through the breakers, the English would undoubtedly have\r\nmade good their claim to the discovery of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, American trading ships began to extend their\r\noperations into the North Pacific. In 1787 two such vessels left\r\nBoston, one of them under command of a Captain Gray. After reaching\r\nthe Pacific, the ships were parted during a storm, and Captain Gray\r\nfinally touched the American coast near the forty-sixth degree of\r\nnorth latitude. For nine days he tried to enter an opening which\r\nwas in all probability the one attempted by Meares. After nearly\r\nlosing his ship and suffering an Indian attack, he sailed north\r\nto Nootka Sound.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gray returned to Boston, but in 1790 started upon another\r\ntrading expedition in command of the ship _Columbia_. Arriving\r\nsafely in the North Pacific, he spent the winter of 1791-1792 upon\r\nVancouver Island.\r\n\r\nVancouver, whose name has been given to the largest island upon\r\nthe western coast of North America, and who did so much to make\r\nknown the intricate coast line of the Puget Sound region, arrived\r\nupon the scene in 1792. He was authorized to carry on explorations,\r\nand to treat with Spain concerning the abandonment of the Spanish\r\nclaim to Nootka Sound.\r\n\r\nVancouver sailed up the coast, keeping a close lookout for the\r\nriver San Roque. No opening in the land appeared, although at one\r\nspot he sailed through a muddy-colored sea which he judged was\r\naffected by the water of some river. Upon reaching the Strait of\r\nFuca, Vancouver expressed the opinion that there was no river between\r\nthe fortieth and forty-eighth degrees of north latitude, \"only\r\nbrooks insufficient for our vessels to navigate.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this time, Vancouver met Captain Gray with his ship\r\n_Columbia_. The disheartened explorer placed no confidence in Captain\r\nGray's report that, upon his former voyage, he had discovered a\r\nlarge river to the south. Vancouver in his narrative says, \"I was\r\nthoroughly convinced that we could not possibly have passed any\r\nsafe navigable opening, harbor, or place of security for shipping\r\non this coast from Cape Mendocino to the promontory of Closset\"\r\n(Cape Flattery).\r\n\r\nCaptain Gray, however, determined to make further investigations.\r\nHe sailed southward and entered a port now known as Gray's Harbor,\r\nwhere he spent several days trading with the Indians. From this\r\nharbor he ran on south for a few miles past Cape Disappointment,\r\nand then sailed through an opening in the breakers into a bay which\r\nhe supposed formed the mouth of the river of which he was in search.\r\nHe finally anchored, as he says, \"in a large river of fresh water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--A SCENE ON GRAY'S HARBOR, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nShowing sawmills and log booms]\r\n\r\nLater Captain Gray took the vessel twelve or fifteen miles up the\r\nriver, and would have gone farther if he had not wandered into the\r\nwrong channel. When he left the river he named it the Columbia\r\nin honor of his vessel. Thus by the right of actual discovery the\r\nUnited States was at last able to make good its claim to the river.\r\n\r\nThe English claimed that Gray did not enter the river itself, as\r\nthe tide sets up many miles farther than the point which his ship\r\nreached. They insisted that what he saw was simply a bay. But the\r\ntruth is that Gray was actually in the mouth of the river. The mere\r\nfact that the tide enters the lower portion of the river makes\r\nno difference. The actual mouth of the Columbia is marked by the\r\nnorth and south coast line. The entrance of the tide water, and\r\nthe backing of the current for many miles up stream, is the result\r\nof a recent sinking of the land. The same features are presented\r\nby the Hudson River.\r\n\r\nIf the English had discovered and entered the river first it is\r\nprobable that this stream would have become the boundary line between\r\nthe United States and British Columbia, in which case the whole\r\nnorthern portion of the Oregon territory would have been lost to\r\nus. As it was, the English laid insistent claim to the northern\r\nbank of the river and established trading posts at various points.\r\nThe lowest of these posts stood upon the site of Fort Vancouver,\r\na little above the mouth of the Willamette River.\r\n\r\nThe famous exploring expedition under Captains Lewis and Clark\r\nwintered at the mouth of the Columbia in 1804-1805, in a group\r\nof rude log cabins known as Fort Clatsop. The first settlement\r\nin the vicinity was made in 1811, when a fur company organized by\r\nJohn Jacob Astor attempted to establish a trading post upon the\r\nColumbia. Two parties were sent out from New York. One travelled\r\nby water around Cape Horn, while the other, with great difficulty,\r\ncrossed the continent by the way of the Missouri, Snake, and Columbia\r\nrivers. The undertaking proved unsuccessful, for after the War of\r\n1812 began supplies could no longer be sent safely to the post.\r\n\r\nThe Astor company finally surrendered its establishment to an English\r\ncompany, and in this way the control of the river was transferred\r\nto England. With the return of peace the post was restored to the\r\nUnited States, and its location is marked now by the city of Astoria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--TILLAMOOK ROCK\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Columbia River]\r\n\r\nWhat small things sometimes determine the trend of great events!\r\nA little more care and energy on the part of Vancouver or Meares\r\nwould have placed the Columbia River in the hands of the English.\r\nThe existence of an open river mouth without any breaking bar would\r\nhave brought about the same result.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards came first to the Pacific slope, claiming the whole\r\ncoast as far north as the Russian possessions. Later the United\r\nStates, by treaty with Spain and Russia, acquired a right to all\r\nthat portion of the Pacific coast of North America which lies between\r\nCalifornia and the Russian possessions. But because of the greater\r\nenergy of the English, and the failure upon the part of the United\r\nStates to realize the value of this vast region, a considerable\r\nsection was again lost by the terms of the treaty which made the\r\nforty-ninth parallel the boundary line. The intelligence and energy\r\nof Captain Gray alone preserved to us the rich lands of Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--ASTORIA, OREGON\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Columbia River]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BASIN AND ITS PECULIAR LAKES\r\n\r\nAs our country was slowly being explored and settled, one region\r\nwas brought to light which Nature seemed to have left unfinished\r\nand in a desolate condition. This barren stretch of country was once\r\nmarked upon the maps as the Great American Desert, and included a\r\nlarge part of the extensive region lying between the Rocky Mountains\r\nupon the east and the Sierra Nevada Mountains upon the west. To the\r\nsouth lay the Grand Canon of the Colorado, while upon the north\r\nthe boundary was formed by the canons of the Snake and Columbia\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nAfter a time it was found that this region, covering about two\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand square miles, not only was extremely\r\ndry, but had no outlet to the ocean. A rim of higher land all about\r\nmade of it so perfect a basin that it became known as the Great\r\nBasin. None of the water that falls upon the surface of this basin\r\never reaches the ocean through surface streams. Some of it soaks\r\ninto the rocks, but the greater part is evaporated into the dry\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned something about the way in which the ridges\r\nand hollows of the earth's surface are made. We have learned of\r\nthe wrinkling of the crust, of the formation of fissures, and of\r\nthe erosive work of running water. The interesting features of\r\nthe Great Basin are mainly the result of two causes: the sinking\r\nof a portion of the earth's surface, and the lack of rainfall.\r\n\r\nLong ago the Wasatch Range of eastern Utah and the Sierra Nevadas\r\nof California formed parts of a vast elevated plateau. Then there\r\ncame a time when the forces holding up the plateau were relaxed,\r\nand as the weight of the plateau pressed it down, the solid rocks\r\nbroke into huge fragments. Some of the blocks thus made sank and\r\nformed valleys; others were tilted or pushed up and formed mountains.\r\nThus the north and south mountain ranges and valleys of the Great\r\nBasin were born.\r\n\r\nWe must understand, then, that the Great Basin is not a simple\r\ndepression with higher land all about. The breaking up of the surface\r\nproduced many basins, large and small. Some of these basins are six\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, others are much lower,\r\nand one has been dropped below the level of the sea, so that if it\r\nwere not for barriers the water would flow in. Some of the basins\r\nare rimmed all about by steep mountains, others are so broad and\r\nflat that it is difficult to tell that they really are basins.\r\nMany of the valleys are so connected with one another that if a\r\nheavy rainfall should ever occur drainage systems would be quickly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin now appears like the skeleton of a dried-up world; but\r\nif the climate should change and become like that of the Mississippi\r\nValley, the surface of the desert would undergo a wondrous\r\ntransformation. The hundreds of basins, if fed by streams from\r\nthe surrounding mountains, would then become lakes. The highest,\r\noverflowing, would empty into a lower, and this in turn into a\r\nstill lower basin, until the water had accumulated in vast inland\r\nseas. These seas, overflowing the rim of the Great Basin at its\r\nlowest points, would send rivers hastening away to the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the Great Basin showing the location and extent\r\nof the ancient lake beds.]\r\n\r\nWhat a region of lakes this would be for a time! Then they would\r\nbegin to disappear, for lakes are short-lived as compared with\r\nmountains. Some would be filled with clay and gravel brought by\r\nthe streams. Others would be drained by a cutting down of their\r\noutlets.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake, which is the only body of water in the Basin that\r\nhas ever sent a stream to the ocean, was lowered four hundred feet\r\nby the washing away of the rock and earth at its outlet.\r\n\r\nWe know that the rainfall never has been heavy in this region since\r\nthe Great Basin was formed, although at one time it was sufficiently\r\ngreat to form two inland seas, one in northwestern Nevada, the\r\nother in Utah.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for the dryness of the Great Basin is the presence\r\nof that lofty barrier, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, between\r\nthe Basin and the Pacific Ocean. The storms, which usually come\r\nfrom the ocean, are intercepted by this range, and the greater\r\nportion of their moisture is taken away. The little moisture that\r\nremains falls upon the highlands of the Great Basin, and so relieves\r\nits surface from utter barrenness. The adjacent slopes of the Sierra\r\nNevada and Wasatch ranges furnish numerous perennial streams which\r\nfeed the lakes about the borders of the Basin, such as Great Salt\r\nLake, Pyramid, Walker, Mono, Honey, and Owens lakes. The wet weather\r\nstreams, flowing down the desert mountains for a short time each\r\nyear, frequently form broad, shallow lakes which disappear with\r\nthe coming of the summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Great Basin has changed from time to time. During\r\none period it was much drier than it is now, and the lakes were\r\nnearly or quite dried up. It must have been a desolate region then,\r\nshunned by animals and forbidden to man.\r\n\r\nDuring the Glacial period, a few thousand years ago, the climate\r\nwas moister and cooler than it is now. The mountains were covered\r\nwith deep snows, and glaciers crept down the slopes of the higher\r\npeaks. Great Salt Lake covered all northwestern Utah; to this former\r\nbody of water the name Bonneville has been given, in honor of a noted\r\ntrapper. Pyramid, Winnemucca, Carson, Walker, and Honey lakes, now\r\nseparated from one another by sagebrush deserts, were then united\r\nin one great lake, to which the name Lahontan has been given, in\r\nhonor of an early French explorer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--MONO LAKE, CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nLake Lahontan covered a large portion of northwestern Nevada and\r\npenetrated into California. It was broken into long winding arms\r\nand bays by various mountain ranges. The deepest portion of this\r\nancient lake is now occupied by Pyramid Lake, which is, perhaps,\r\nthe most picturesque of all the Basin lakes. Fish can live in the\r\nwaters of this lake, although nearly all the others are so salty\r\nor so alkaline that they support none of the ordinary forms of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--ROUND HOLE, A SPRING IN THE SMOKE CREEK\r\nDESERT\r\n\r\nBed of old Lake Lahontan]\r\n\r\nUpon the Black Rock Desert, in northern Nevada, there are large\r\nsprings once covered by Lake Lahontan, in which fish are found.\r\nIt is thought that the ancestors of these fish must have been left\r\nthere at the time of the drying up of the water.\r\n\r\nAfter the Glacial period the present arid climate began to prevail\r\nin the land. Hundreds of the shallow lakes which had been scattered\r\nover this extensive region disappeared. Others contained water for\r\nonly a portion of each year. A body of water which is not permanent,\r\nbut comes and goes with the seasons, we call a playa lake. Many of\r\nthese playa lakes present in summer a hard, yellow-clay floor of\r\nmany miles in extent and entirely free from vegetation. The beds\r\nof others are covered with a whitish crust, formed of the various\r\nsalts which were in solution in the lake water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--ROGERS LAKE, MOHAVE DESERT\r\n\r\nA playa lake]\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the lakes of the Great Basin is the presence\r\nof large quantities of such substances as common salt, soda, borax,\r\nand nitre. The ocean is salt because it has no outlet, while the\r\nrivers of the globe are continually bringing into it various minerals,\r\ndissolved from the rocks over which they flow. Lakes with outlets\r\nare not salty, because with a continuous change of the water there\r\nis no opportunity for the minerals to accumulate, although they\r\nare always present in small quantities. Any lake which does not\r\nreceive enough running water to cause it to overflow the borders\r\nof its basin, will in course of time become rich in various kinds\r\nof salt.\r\n\r\nNo two of the lakes of the Great Basin are alike in the composition\r\nof their waters. This fact may be due to a difference in the rocks\r\nabout the lake basin, to the presence of varying mineral springs,\r\nor to the drying up of one or more of the lakes at some time so\r\nthat their former salts were buried under sands and clays when\r\nthe water again filled the basin.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake contains little besides common salt. In Mono Lake,\r\nsoda and salt are equally important constituents, while Owens Lake\r\ncontains an excess of soda. In other basins borax was present in\r\nsuch quantities that when the waters dried up it formed important\r\ndeposits. The value of these deposits is now fully understood, and\r\nmany enterprising companies are at work separating and purifying\r\nthe borax.\r\n\r\nOwens Lake was once fresh, although now it is so strong with soda\r\nthat it would destroy the skin if a bather should remain in it very\r\nlong. The former outlet of this lake was toward the south, through\r\na pass separating the Sierra Nevada from the Coso Mountains. For a\r\ndistance of thirty miles the old river-bed has been transformed\r\ninto a wagon road, and it is interesting to ride all day along the\r\nbed of this dead river, past bold cliffs against which the waters\r\nonce surged and foamed. The river emptied far to the south, into a\r\nbroad, shallow lake whose former bed is now white with soda and\r\nborax. The old beach lines stand out distinctly upon the slopes of\r\nthe enclosing mountains.\r\n\r\nThe lake bed is now the seat of an important industry--the gathering\r\nof the borax and its refining. There are extensive buildings at\r\none spot upon its border, and men come and go across the blinding\r\nwhite surface. A twenty-mule team dragging three huge wagons creeps\r\nslowly along the base of the distant mountains, but all that can\r\nbe distinguished is a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--FREIGHTING BORAX ACROSS THE DESERT]\r\n\r\nThe slow crumbling of the rocks, and the setting free of those\r\nconstituents which are soluble, the work of the streams in gathering\r\nthe rock waste into the lakes, the dry air and the heat of the long\r\nsummer days, have all conspired together to give us these valuable\r\ndeposits in the dried-up lakes of the Great Basin.\r\n\r\nNo portion of the earth seems to be without value to man. The great\r\nbodies of water are convenient highways. The rich valleys and timbered\r\nmountains offer useful products. Even the deserts, where living\r\nthings of every description find the struggle for existence very\r\nhard, become indispensable. If the climate in the Great Basin had\r\nbeen moist, the salts would not have been preserved, but would\r\nhave been carried away to the ocean, from which only common salt\r\ncould have been recovered in commercial quantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--MUSHROOM ROCK, PYRAMID LAKE\r\n\r\nFormed of calcareous tufa]\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the Great Basin was dreaded by the early emigrants\r\non their way to the Pacific coast. In many cases the locations of\r\nthe few springs and water-courses were unknown, and the journey\r\nover the vast barren stretches was fraught with danger.\r\n\r\nStand upon a mountain in the desert some clear day in summer and\r\nyou will see range after range, with intervening sandy wastes,\r\nstretching away to the horizon. The air below is tremulous with\r\nheat, and every living thing that can move has sought the shade\r\nof some rock or cliff. The plants seem almost dead, for the little\r\nsprings, hidden at rare intervals in the deep canons, are of no\r\nuse to them.\r\n\r\nWhat transformations would be wrought upon these desert slopes if\r\nit were possible for the soil to receive and retain large quantities\r\nof water! Forest-covered mountains, green hillsides, rippling streams,\r\nlakes, farms, orchards, and towns would appear as if by magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREMONT'S ADVENTURES IN THE GREAT BASIN\r\n\r\nFremont, \"the Pathfinder,\" did greater service than any other man\r\nin making known the geographic features of the Cordilleran region.\r\nIn the fifth decade of the last century, while California still\r\nbelonged to Mexico and the pioneers were turning their attention to\r\nthe Oregon country, Fremont organized and conducted three exploring\r\nexpeditions under the direction of the government. When in California\r\nupon the third expedition he took part in the skirmishes which\r\nresulted in the transference of this section to the United States.\r\n\r\nA fourth expedition, undertaken by Fremont on his own account,\r\nresulted disastrously. The explorers foolishly tried to cross the\r\nRocky Mountains in the middle of winter, but had to give up the\r\nattempt after many of the party had died from cold and starvation.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us to realize, now, that only sixty years ago the\r\nterritory lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific coast\r\nwas practically unknown. Try to imagine the feelings of emigrants,\r\nbound for the gold-fields of California, who have pushed into the\r\nGreat Basin without knowing where to look for grass or water. They\r\nare camped by a spring of alkaline water scarcely fit to drink;\r\ntheir weary animals nibble at the scanty grass about the spring;\r\nfar ahead stretches the pathless desert which they must cross;\r\nupon their choice of a route their very lives will depend.\r\n\r\nNow it is all changed. The whole region is crossed and recrossed by\r\nwagon roads and railways. Many mining towns are scattered through\r\nthe mountains which dot the seemingly boundless expanse of desert,\r\nwhile in every place where water can be found there are gardens,\r\ngreen fields of alfalfa, and herds of cattle.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1840 some knowledge had been acquired of the borders\r\nof the Great Basin. Trappers and explorers had crossed the Rocky\r\nMountains and had gone down the Columbia River. There were Spanish\r\nsettlements in New Mexico, Arizona, and along the coast of California.\r\n\r\nFremont's first expedition had taken him to the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains in northwestern Wyoming. In 1843 he started upon the\r\nsecond expedition. He was at that time commissioned to cross the\r\nRockies, descend the Columbia to Fort Vancouver, and return by\r\na route farther to the south, across the unknown region between\r\nthe Columbia and the Colorado rivers.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the little band of explorers led by Captain Fremont\r\nas day after day they made their way across what was then a trackless\r\nwaste, and see what troubles they encountered because of the inaccuracy\r\nof the maps of that period.\r\n\r\nLeaving Fort Vancouver, upon the lower Columbia, for the return\r\ntrip, the party ascended the river to The Dalles and then turned\r\nsouthward along the eastern side of the Cascade Range. They soon\r\nentered upon a region never before traversed by white men. At the\r\ntime when autumn was giving place to winter, without reliable guides\r\nor maps, they were to cross the deserts lying between them and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--MAP OF A PORTION OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA,\r\nMADE IN 1826\r\n\r\nShowing the Buenaventura River]\r\n\r\nThey met with no great difficulties until they had gone as far\r\nsouth as Klamath Lake. \"From this point,\" Fremont says, \"our course\r\nwas intended to be about southeast to a reported lake called Mary's,\r\nat some days' journey in the Great Basin, and thence, still on\r\nsoutheast to the reputed Buenaventura (good chance) River, which\r\nhas had a place on so many maps, and countenanced the belief in\r\nthe existence of a great river flowing from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Bay of San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\nFigure 47 shows one of the maps to which Fremont refers. How interesting\r\nit is! Compare it with a good map in your geography and you will\r\nreadily see that it is very misleading. The Sierra Nevada, one of\r\nthe greatest mountain ranges in the United States, hardly appears,\r\nwhile traced directly across the map is the great Buenaventura\r\nRiver which Fremont expected to find and follow eastward toward\r\nits source near the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nIf this river had really been where it was mapped, it is likely\r\nthat Fremont would have had no trouble, for if hard pressed he\r\ncould have followed the stream down to the ocean. But a wall of\r\nsnow-covered mountains lying in the way made matters very different.\r\n\r\nWinter was coming on when the party entered what is now northwestern\r\nNevada, looking for the Buenaventura River. For several weeks they\r\ntoiled on, often through the snow. Concerning this part of the\r\njourney Fremont says: \"We had reached and run over the position\r\nwhere, according to the best maps in my possession, we should have\r\nfound Mary's lake or river. We were evidently on the verge of the\r\ndesert, and the country was so forbidding that we were afraid to\r\nenter it.\"\r\n\r\nThe party then turned south, still hoping that the river might be\r\ndiscovered. After a time they came upon a large lake and travelled\r\nfor many miles along its eastern shore. One camp was made opposite\r\na tall, pyramid-shaped island, the white surface of which made it\r\nconspicuous for a long distance. Fremont was much impressed by\r\nthe resemblance of the island to the pyramids of Egypt and so named\r\nthe body of water Pyramid Lake. At the southern end of the lake the\r\ntravellers found a large stream flowing into it (now known as the\r\nTruckee River), and followed along its banks for some distance;\r\nbut as the river turned toward the west, they left it and struck\r\nout across the country.\r\n\r\nFremont says again, \"With every stream I now expected to see the\r\ngreat Buenaventura, and Carson (Kit Carson, the famous scout) hurried\r\neagerly to search on every one we reached for beaver cuttings,\r\nwhich he always maintained we should find only on waters which ran\r\nto the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--PYRAMID ISLAND, PYRAMID LAKE, NEVADA]\r\n\r\nBut all the streams flowed in the wrong direction, until at last the\r\nexplorers grew weary of hunting for the river which had no existence.\r\nAlthough it was the middle of the winter, Fremont determined to\r\ncross the lofty Sierras which rose like a white wall to the west.\r\nOnce over the mountains, he hoped to gain the American settlements\r\nin the Sacramento Valley, where already Sutter's Fort had been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe party ascended Walker River, dragging, with great difficulty,\r\na howitzer which they had brought with them. The snows grew deeper\r\nas storm succeeded storm. Feeling that they were really lost, the\r\ndisheartened men at length abandoned the gun, at a spot which has\r\nsince been named Lost Canon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--LOST CANON, EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SIERRA\r\nNEVADA MOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nWhen their own provisions were nearly gone, the party obtained\r\nsome pine nuts and also several rabbits from the Indians. A dog\r\nwhich had been brought along made one good meal for the wayfarers.\r\nAn Indian who had been persuaded to act as guide pointed out the spot\r\nwhere two white men, one of whom was Walker, a noted frontiersman,\r\nhad once crossed the mountains; but the guide made them understand\r\nthat it was impossible to cross at that time of the year, saying,\r\nin his own language, \"Rock upon rock, snow upon snow.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough they could advance only by breaking paths through the\r\nsnow, and were reduced to eating mule and horse flesh, yet the\r\nFremont party pushed on. Finally they reached the summit of the\r\nmountains and turned down by the head of a stream flowing westward,\r\nwhich proved to be the American River. After three weeks more of\r\nterrible suffering they came out of the mountains at Sutter's Fort,\r\nwhere they obtained supplies and had an opportunity to rest and\r\nrecruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--FREMONT PEAK, MOHAVE DESERT]\r\n\r\nFremont now recognized the incorrectness of the maps which had\r\nso nearly caused the destruction of the party. As he says in his\r\nnotes: \"No river from the interior does, or can, cross the Sierra\r\nNevada, itself more lofty than the Rocky Mountains... There is no\r\nopening from the Bay of San Francisco into the interior of the\r\ncontinent.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the return journey was begun the party did not recross the\r\nhigh Sierras, but turned southward through the San Joaquin Valley\r\nand gained the Mohave Desert by the way of Tehachapai pass. The\r\nroute now led eastward across the deserts and low mountain ranges\r\nof California and southern Nevada, until at last Great Salt Lake\r\nwas reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--SAGE-BRUSH IN THE GREAT BASIN]\r\n\r\nAmong the many geographical discoveries of the expedition was the\r\ndemonstration of the existence of the Great Basin. In his report,\r\nFremont, while speaking of its vast sterile valleys and of the\r\nIndians which inhabit them, says: \"That it is peopled we know,\r\nbut miserably and sparsely ... dispersed in single families ...\r\neating seeds and insects, digging roots (hence their name) [Digger\r\nIndians], such is the condition of the greater part. Others are\r\na degree higher and live in communities upon some lake or river\r\nfrom which they repulse the miserable Diggers.\r\n\r\n\"The rabbit is the largest animal known in this desert, its flesh\r\naffords a little meat.... The wild sage is their only wood, and\r\nhere it is of extraordinary size--sometimes a foot in diameter and\r\nsix or eight feet high. It serves for fuel, for building material,\r\nfor shelter for the rabbits, and for some sort of covering for the\r\nfeet and legs in cold weather. But I flatter myself that what is\r\ndiscovered, though not enough to satisfy curiosity, is sufficient\r\nto excite it, and that subsequent explorations will complete what\r\nhas been commenced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GREAT SALT LAKE\r\n\r\nThe most interesting geographical feature of Utah is the Great\r\nSalt Lake. Few tourists now cross the continent without visiting\r\nthe lake and taking a bath in its briny waters. This strange body\r\nof water has, however, been slowly growing smaller for some years,\r\nand probably will in time disappear. A study of the history of the\r\nlake may throw some light upon the important question of its possible\r\ndisappearance, and it will certainly bring out many interesting\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nWe do not know with certainty who was the first white man to look\r\nupon this inland sea, although it is supposed to have been James\r\nBridger, a noted trapper, who in 1825 followed Bear River down to\r\nits mouth. He tasted the water and found it salt, a fact which\r\nencouraged him in the belief that he had found an arm of the Pacific\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred years ago there were vague ideas about a\r\nsalt lake situated somewhere beyond the Rocky Mountains. In 1689\r\nBaron Lahontan published an account of his travels from Mackinac\r\nto the Mississippi River and the region beyond. He states that he\r\nascended a westerly branch of the river for six weeks, until the\r\nseason became too late for farther progress. He reports meeting\r\nsavages who said that one hundred and fifty leagues beyond there\r\nwas a salt lake, \"three hundred leagues in circumference--its mouth\r\nstretching a great way to the southward.\"\r\n\r\nThis imaginative story aroused interest in the West. In a book\r\npublished in 1772, devoted to a description of the province La\r\nLouisiane, the possibility of water communication with the South\r\nSea is discussed as follows: \"It will be of great convenience to\r\nthis country, if ever it becomes settled, that there is an easy\r\ncommunication therewith, and the South Sea, which lies between\r\nAmerica and China, and that two ways: by the north branch of the\r\ngreat Yellow River, by the natives called the river of the 'Massorites'\r\n(Missouri), which hath a course of five hundred miles, navigable\r\nto its head, or springs, and which proceeds from a ridge of hills\r\nsomewhat north of New Mexico, passable by horse, foot, or wagon,\r\nin less than half a day. On the other side are rivers which run\r\ninto a great lake that empties itself by another navigable river\r\ninto the South Sea. The same may be said of the Meschaouay, up\r\nwhich our people have been, but not so far as the Baron Lahontan,\r\nwho passed on it above three hundred miles almost due west, and\r\ndeclares it comes from the same ridge of hills above mentioned,\r\nand that divers rivers from the other side soon make a large river,\r\nwhich enters into a vast lake, on which inhabit two or three great\r\nnations, much more populous and civilized than other Indians; and\r\nout of that lake a great river disembogues into the South Sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Father Escalante travelled from Santa Fe far to the north\r\nand west. He met Indians who told him of a lake the waters of which\r\nproduced a burning sensation when placed upon the skin. This was\r\nprobably Great Salt Lake, but it is not thought that he himself\r\never saw it. The Escalante Desert, in southern Utah, once covered\r\nby the waters of the lake, is named after this explorer.\r\n\r\nNothing more seems to have been learned of the lake after its discovery\r\nby Bridger until in 1833 Bonneville, a daring leader among the\r\ntrappers, organized a party for its exploration. Washington Irving,\r\nin his history of Captain Bonneville, says of the party, \"A desert\r\nsurrounded them and stretched to the southwest as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, rivalling the deserts of Asia and Africa in sterility.\r\nThere was neither tree, nor herbage, nor spring, nor pool, nor\r\nrunning stream, nothing but parched wastes of sand, where horse\r\nand rider were in danger of perishing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--SCENE ON GREAT SALT LAKE]\r\n\r\nAlthough decreasing in area so rapidly, Great Salt Lake is still\r\nthe largest body of water in the western part of the United States,\r\nand the largest salt lake within its boundaries. It has a length\r\nof seventy miles and a maximum width of nearly fifty miles.\r\n\r\nDesolate, indeed, must have appeared the surroundings of the lake,\r\nwith its salt-incrusted borders, as the Mormon emigrants gained the\r\nsummit of the Wasatch Range and looked out over the vast expanse\r\nto the west. But as the slopes at the foot of the mountains seemed\r\ncapable of producing food for their support, they stopped and made\r\ntheir homes there. Now in this same region, after half a century, one\r\ncan ride for many miles through as beautiful and highly cultivated\r\na country as the sun ever looked down upon. In the early days the\r\nbarren plains were broken only by mountains almost as barren, which\r\nrose from them like the islands from the surface of the Great Salt\r\nLake. The only pleasing prospect was toward the east, where stood\r\nthe steep and rugged Wasatch Range, with its snow-capped peaks.\r\nFrom its deep canons issued large streams of pure, cold water,\r\nwhich flowed undisturbed across the brush-covered slopes, then\r\nunbroken by irrigating ditches, and at last were lost in the salt\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nOne might think that streams of water apparently so pure would\r\nat last freshen the lake, but in reality they are carrying along\r\ninvisible particles of mineral matter which add to its saltness\r\nday by day. The dry air steals away the water from the lake as\r\nfast as it runs in, but cannot take the minerals which it holds\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake is still considered very large, but at one time\r\nit was ten times its present size, while still longer ago there\r\nwas no lake at all. Without a basin there can be no lake, and at\r\nthat far-away time, as we have already learned, the Great Basin\r\ndid not exist, and the streams, if there were any, ran away to\r\nthe ocean without hindrance.\r\n\r\nWhen the Great Basin was formed by a breaking and bending of the\r\ncrust of the earth, many a stream lost its connection with the\r\nocean and went to work filling up the smaller basins, thus giving\r\nrise to the lakes which have already been described. The largest of\r\nthese bodies of water, and in some respects the most interesting,\r\nis Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--OLD SHORE LINE OF LAKE BONNEVILLE\r\n\r\nFoot of the Wasatch Range]\r\n\r\nThis lake, lying close to the lofty Wasatch Range, received so\r\nmuch water from numerous streams during the Glacial period that\r\nit slowly spread over thousands of square miles, overrunning the\r\ndesert valleys and making islands of the scattered mountain ranges.\r\nIt extended from north to south across Utah, into southern Idaho\r\nand almost to the Arizona line, until this body of water, which\r\narose from so small beginnings, had become a veritable inland sea,\r\nthree hundred miles long, one hundred miles wide, and one thousand\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nBy the time the lake had covered an area of twenty thousand square\r\nmiles the lowest point in the rim of the basin was reached and the\r\noverflow began. No map will tell you where the outlet was, for\r\nno river exists there now. If you could explore the shore lines\r\nof this ancient lake, which has been called Bonneville after the\r\nnoted trapper, you would find two low spots in the mountains which\r\nhem the waters in, one upon the south, facing the Colorado River,\r\nthe other on the north toward the Snake River. The one on the north\r\nhappened to be a little lower, so that the break occurred there.\r\nFirst as a little, trickling stream, then as a mighty, surging\r\nriver, the water poured northward down the valley of a small stream,\r\nwidening and deepening it until, passing the spot where now the\r\ntown of Pocatello stands, it joined the Snake River.\r\n\r\nThis old outlet is now known as Red Rock Pass, and it forms an\r\neasy route for the Oregon Short Line from Salt Lake City to the\r\nplains of southern Idaho. The old river-bed is marked by marshes\r\nand fertile farms.\r\n\r\nWith an outlet established, Lake Bonneville could rise no higher,\r\nand its waves began the formation of a well-defined terrace or\r\nbeach, just as waves are sure to do along every shore. The level\r\nof the water could not remain permanently at the same height, for\r\nthe rocks at the outlet were being worn away by the large volume\r\nof water which flowed over them. In the course of years the level\r\nof the lake was lowered four hundred feet. The sinking was not\r\nuniform, but took place by stages, while at each period of rest\r\nthe waves made a new beach line. The lake during all this time\r\nmust have been a beautiful sheet of fresh water filled with fish.\r\nIts shores, also, must have been much richer in vegetation than\r\nthey are now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--RED ROCK PASS, SOUTHERN IDAHO\r\n\r\nOutlet of Lake Bonneville]\r\n\r\nThe water remained for a long time at the level of four hundred\r\nfeet below its highest stage. This fact is evident from the width\r\nof the wave-cut terrace, which is the most prominent of all those\r\nthat mark the old levels along the sides of the mountains. Finally,\r\nfor some reason the climate began to change, the streams supplied\r\nless water to the lake, and the evaporation from its surface became\r\ngreater because the air was drier. As a result the lake was lowered\r\nto such an extent that it lost its outlet. The mighty river flowing\r\ndown through Red Rock Canon grew smaller and at last dried up\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the lake was again cut off from the ocean, as it\r\nhad been during its earlier history. The waters still continued\r\nto recede, but not at a uniform rate. During periods of greater\r\nrain its level remained stationary, so that the waves added new\r\nterraces to those already formed.\r\n\r\nAs the lake had no outlet and was decreasing in volume, the water\r\nbecame salty, for the minerals brought by the streams could no\r\nlonger be carried away. The fish either died or passed up into the\r\npurer waters of the inflowing streams.\r\n\r\nThe water of the present lake is so salt that in every four quarts\r\nthere is one quart of salt, and the preparation of this commodity by\r\na process of evaporating the water in ponds has become an important\r\nindustry. The water is the strongest kind of brine and it is impossible\r\nfor a bather to sink in it. One floats about upon it almost as lightly\r\nas wood does upon ordinary water. After bathing it is necessary to\r\nwash in fresh water to remove the salt from the body.\r\n\r\nThe dry bed of the former Lake Bonneville stretches far to the\r\nsouth and west of the present lake, and forms one of the most barren\r\nand arid regions in the United States. It is sometimes called the\r\nGreat American Desert.\r\n\r\nWhy is the lake receding now? Some people think that the climate is\r\ngrowing still more arid, and that the lake will eventually disappear.\r\nOthers think that its shrinkage is the result of irrigation, for a\r\nlarge part of the water from the streams which supply it is now\r\ntaken out and turned upon the land. There is still another reason\r\nwhich may account for the low water. The lake is known to rise\r\nand fall during a series of wet and dry years. When first mapped,\r\nin the middle of the last century, it was about as low as it is\r\nnow. Then it gradually rose for a number of years and lately has\r\nagain been falling.\r\n\r\nThe story of Great Salt Lake has been much more complicated than\r\nthe statement given above, but this is sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\nIrrigation has made a garden spot of a large part of the old bed\r\nof Lake Bonneville, but much of the beauty and attractiveness of\r\nthis region would be lost if the present lake should give place\r\nto a bed of glistening salt. Let us hope that it will remain as\r\nit is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKAGIT RIVER\r\n\r\nThe Skagit is not one of the great rivers of the world, for very\r\nlittle of its course lies outside the boundaries of a single state.\r\nIt is, however, none the less interesting. Few rivers with a length\r\nof only one hundred and fifty miles present so great a variety of\r\ninstructive features. We shall certainly learn more from a study\r\nof the Skagit than from many a better known and more pretentious\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nInnumerable torrents, fed by the glaciers of the Cascade Range,\r\npour down the rocky slopes and lose themselves in the wooded canons\r\nbelow. The canon streams, of much greater size, flow less impetuously\r\nover gentler slopes, and are frequently blocked by boulders and\r\nlogs. These streams unite in one broad, deep river, which moves\r\non quietly to its resting-place in Puget Sound. Its name, Skagit,\r\nis of Indian origin and means _wild cat_.\r\n\r\nBy following the Skagit River and a tributary stream, one can go\r\nfrom the bare and snowy summit of the Cascade Range down through\r\ndense forests, and come out at last upon a magnificent delta, where\r\na fertile plain is slowly but steadily encroaching upon the waters\r\nof the sound. What contrasting scenes are presented along the few\r\nshort miles of the course of the river! A trip from its source\r\nto its mouth will be worth all the trouble it involves, although\r\nthe trail is often disagreeably wet and sometimes dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere is no grander scenery in the United States than that of the\r\nCascade Range; nor are there more dense forests than those found\r\nupon its western slope. The range is hidden in almost perpetual\r\nclouds and storms, and they are fortunate who can reach its summit\r\nupon a pleasant day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--SUMMIT OF THE CASCADE RANGE, NEAR THE HEAD\r\nOF THE SKAGIT RIVER]\r\n\r\nThe forests of fir and hemlock have gained a foothold nearly to the\r\nsummit of the range. Upon the little benches and in the protected\r\nnooks the trees grow thriftily, and dense groves are found up to an\r\nelevation of nearly five thousand feet; but upon the more exposed\r\nand rocky slopes stunted trunks show the effect of a constant struggle\r\nwith the rocks and winds. Upon other slopes, too high for the trees\r\nto grow, there are low shrubs and arctic mosses; but above all rise\r\nprecipitous crags and peaks, utterly bare except for the glaciers\r\nnestling among them.\r\n\r\nUnder the shade of the upland forests the moss is damp and the\r\nwood wet, so that it is difficult to make a comfortable camp or to\r\nbuild a fire. But these discomforts are not worthy of consideration\r\nin view of the inspiration which one gains by the outlook from some\r\ncommanding point upon the summit of the mountain range.\r\n\r\nAll about are jagged, splintered peaks. Upon every gentle slope\r\nthere rests, within some alcove, a glistening mass of snow and\r\nice. A score of these glaciers are in sight. They are supplied\r\nin winter by the drifting snows, and yield in summer, from their\r\nlower extremities, streams of ice-cold water. A multitude of streams\r\nraise a gentle murmur, broken occasionally by a dull roar as some\r\nglacier, in its slow descent, breaks upon the edge of a precipice\r\nand its fragments fall into the canon below.\r\n\r\nFrom a position upon the summit above the point where the Skagit\r\ntrail crosses the mountains may be seen a little lake, on the surface\r\nof which remains some of last winter's ice not yet melted by the\r\nAugust sun. If the climate were a little colder, the basin would\r\nbe occupied by a glacier instead of a lake. All about the lake\r\nthere are steep, rocky slopes, more or less completely covered\r\nwith low arctic plants and stunted, storm-beaten hemlocks. From\r\namong the trees at the foot of the lake rises the roof of a miner's\r\nlog cabin, and a few hundred feet beyond a small, dark opening in\r\nthe face of a cliff shows where the miner is running a tunnel in\r\nhis search for gold.\r\n\r\nFar below, and heading close under the sharp crest of the range,\r\nare densely wooded canons. The fair weather is passing, and it\r\nis necessary to find the trail and descend. Clouds are sweeping\r\nacross the ridges and peaks, and soon the whole summit will be\r\ncovered by them.\r\n\r\nFrom a point a little east of the summit the clouds present a grand\r\nsight at the gathering of a storm. Higher and higher they pile\r\nupon the ocean face of the mountains. At the bottom they are dark\r\nand threatening, but the thunder-heads above can be seen bathed in\r\nthe bright sunlight. For a time the clouds hang upon the summit\r\nas if stopped by some invisible barrier; perhaps they are loath\r\nto pass into the drier air of the eastern slope. But finally they\r\nmove on, and rain or snow soon envelops the whole landscape.\r\n\r\nThe trail descends rapidly for four thousand feet to Cascade River,\r\na tributary of the Skagit. It is a steep and slippery way, and\r\nin many places it is not safe to ride the horses. The sub-arctic\r\nclimate of the summit is left behind, and one is soon surrounded\r\nby dense and luxuriant vegetation. Such a change as this, in a\r\nshort distance, shows how greatly elevation affects climate and\r\nplant growth.\r\n\r\nUpon every hand there is the sound of rushing water. From the cliffs\r\nribbon-like cascades are falling. The rivulets unite in one stream,\r\nwhich roars and tumbles down the canon over logs and boulders. The\r\ntrail crosses and recrosses the torrent until the water becomes\r\ntoo deep for fording, and then it leads one to a rude bridge made\r\nof two logs with split planks laid across them.\r\n\r\nAs the canon widens, the trail leads farther from the river and\r\nthrough dense forests. The woods are so silent that they become\r\noppressive, and the air is damp, for the sunlight is almost excluded.\r\nThe tall trees, fir, hemlock, and spruce, with now and then a cedar,\r\nstand close together. Shrubs of many kinds are crowded among them,\r\nwhile mosses and ferns cover the ground. The fallen trunks are\r\nwrapped in moss, and young trees are growing upon them, drawing\r\ntheir nourishment from the decaying tissues. In the more open spots\r\ngrow the salal bushes with their purple berries, the yellow salmon\r\nberries, and the blue-black huckleberries.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to get an idea of the density of a Washington forest,\r\nor of the character of the streams, unless one has actually taken\r\na trip through the region. If one wishes to escape the forest by\r\nfollowing the streams, he will find the path blocked by fallen trees.\r\nIt is necessary continually to climb over or under obstructions,\r\nand the traveller is fortunate if he does not fall into the cold\r\nwater. Upon the banks it is even worse; one must struggle through\r\ndense prickly bushes and ferns, and be tripped every few rods.\r\nThough the forest may appear at first to offer an easier way, it\r\nwill soon be found that creeping and crawling through the undergrowth\r\nof bushes and young trees is exceedingly tiresome, and one will\r\ngladly return to the muddy trail, thankful for its guidance.\r\n\r\nThe mountains become less precipitous and the canon widens to a\r\nvalley, until at last the trail comes out at a clearing where the\r\nCascade River joins the Skagit. At this point, known as Marble\r\nMountain, there is a ferry, also a store and several other buildings.\r\nThe cleared fields seem a relief after many miles of dense forest,\r\nbut such openings are infrequent, for few settlers have yet pushed\r\nfar into the forests of the Skagit valley. To make a clearing of\r\nany size, tear out the stumps, and prepare the land for cultivation,\r\nrequires many years of hard labor.\r\n\r\nHow silently and yet with what momentum the river sweeps on! The\r\nwater is clear in summer, but in winter it must be very muddy,\r\nfor the Skagit is building one of the largest deltas upon Puget\r\nSound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--SKAGIT RIVER IN ITS MIDDLE COURSE]\r\n\r\nAt Marble Mountain the traveller may, if he wishes, leave his horses,\r\nhire an Indian canoe, and float down the river to the nearest railroad\r\nstation. The ride in the cedar canoe, with an Indian at the stern\r\ncarefully guiding it past snags and boulders, is one of the pleasantest\r\nportions of the trip. The winding river is followed for nearly fifty\r\nmiles. There is mile after mile of silent forest, the solitude\r\nbroken only here and there by camps of Indians who are spending\r\nthe summer by the river, fishing and picking huckleberries. Now\r\nand then a call comes from one of these camps, and in spite of the\r\ndanger of being swamped by the swift current, the canoe is turned\r\ntoward the shore, but the stop is only for a moment.\r\n\r\nAt last a new railroad grade comes in sight, with gangs of men at\r\nwork. The valley of the Skagit contains one of the finest bodies\r\nof timber in Washington, and the railroad is being built for the\r\npurpose of reaching this timber. There is little other inducement\r\nfor the building of a railroad; for beside a few summer visitors,\r\nthe only inhabitants are the scattered prospectors and miners.\r\n\r\nWe enter the train at a little town in the woods and are soon speeding\r\ndown the valley toward the mouth of the river. Clearings appear in\r\nthe forest, and at last the view opens out over extensive meadows\r\nwhich stretch away, almost as level as a floor, to the waters of\r\nthe sound. Here and there the meadows are broken by forest trees\r\nor irregular groups of farm buildings. Rich lands form the delta\r\nof the Skagit River. The value of these natural meadows was quickly\r\nrecognized by the early settlers, for not only was the land exceedingly\r\nfertile, but it did not have to be cleared in order to be transformed\r\ninto productive grain-fields.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, ever since the melting of the great glaciers which\r\nonce descended the Cascade Range and crept down the sound, the\r\nriver has been building this delta. It grew rapidly, for immense\r\naccumulations of gravels and clays were left by the retreating\r\nglaciers. The delta has already spread westward into the sound,\r\nuntil it has enveloped some of the smaller islands. The forests\r\ngrowing upon these islands, which rise from the surface of the\r\ndelta plain, are in picturesque contrast to the fields dotted with\r\nstacks of grain.\r\n\r\nThe delta is now practically joined to the eastern side of the\r\nSan Juan Islands. The railroad reaches the islands by means of a\r\ntrestle across the intervening tidal flats, delivering its load\r\nof logs at the mills and leaving the passengers at the town of\r\nAnacortes, where they may take one of the many steamers passing\r\nup and down the sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--THE DELTA OF THE SKAGIT RIVER\r\n\r\nEnveloping former islands in Puget Sound]\r\n\r\nOf all the deltas now forming about Puget Sound that of the Skagit\r\nis the largest and most interesting. One might think that the forests\r\nwould so protect the slopes that erosion would not be rapid, but\r\nthe valleys of all the tributary streams appear deeply filled with\r\nrock fragments, which have, for the most part, accumulated from the\r\nhigher portions of the range, where frost and ice are slowly tearing\r\ndown the cliffs. At each period of flood some of this material is\r\npassed on to the river, which in turn drops it upon the borders\r\nof its delta.\r\n\r\nThe Skagit River, from its source to its mouth, takes the traveller\r\nthrough varying climates and life zones, from the barren crest\r\nwhere the miner is the only inhabitant, down through forests where\r\nthe lumberman is busy, until it leaves him upon the rich meadows\r\nof its delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LAKE CHELAN\r\n\r\nChelan is the largest and most beautiful of our mountain lakes.\r\nThe lake itself is most attractive, and the basin in which it lies\r\nhas had an interesting history, so that it is well worth study.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the beauties of this lake, it is not widely known,\r\nfor it is situated far away from the main lines of travel, in a\r\nremote canon of the Cascade Range. Fortunately the lake and the\r\nrugged mountains about it have been included in a forest reserve,\r\nso that they will be kept in all their wild natural beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia River, in its crooked course across the state of\r\nWashington, follows for some distance the junction of the vast\r\ntreeless plateau of the central portion and the rugged, forest-clad\r\nslopes of the Cascade Range. We have already learned how the plateau\r\ngrew to its present extent through the outpouring of successive\r\nfloods of lava which swept around the higher mountains like an\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nMany canons furrow the eastern slope of the Cascade Range, and\r\nterminate in the greater canon of the Columbia at the edge of the\r\nlava. One of these canons, deeper and longer than the rest, has been\r\nblocked by a dam at its lower end. Beautiful Lake Chelan lies in\r\nthe basin thus formed. It begins only three miles from the Columbia\r\nRiver, but winds for sixty miles among the rugged and steep-walled\r\nmountains, terminating almost in the heart of the range.\r\n\r\nThe lake can be reached either by crossing the mountains from Puget\r\nSound, over a wet and difficult trail, or by ascending the Columbia\r\nRiver from Wenache, the nearest railroad station. The trip can be\r\nmade from the latter point either upon the stage or river steamer.\r\nThe wagon road is very picturesque, winding now under lofty cliffs\r\nwith the river surging below, now along the occasional patches of\r\nbottom land where in July the orchards are loaded with fruit.\r\n\r\nThe first sight of Lake Chelan is disappointing, for at the lower\r\nend, where the wagon road stops, there is little to suggest the\r\nremarkable scenery farther back in the mountains. Rolling hills,\r\ncovered with grass and scattered pine trees, slope down to the\r\nlake, while here and there farmhouses appear.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help asking at the first view what there is about Lake\r\nChelan which has made it, next to Crater Lake, the most noted body\r\nof water upon the Pacific slope of the continent. But wait a little.\r\nEither hire a rowboat and prepare with blankets and provisions\r\nfor a camping trip about the shores; or if the time is too short\r\nfor carrying out that plan, take the little steamer which makes\r\ntri-weekly trips to the hotel at the head of the lake. Long before\r\nyou reach the upper end you will begin to appreciate the grandeur\r\nof the lake scenery in its setting of steep-walled mountains.\r\n\r\nLittle of Lake Chelan can be seen at one time, for its course among\r\nthe mountains to the west is a very crooked one. The noisy steamer\r\nleaves the town at the foot of the lake and in the course of ten\r\nmiles steeper slopes begin to close in upon us. Many little homes\r\nare scattered along this portion of the lake, wherever there is\r\na bit of land level enough to raise fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nNow the mountains become more rugged and rise more steeply from\r\nthe water's edge. The steamer is very slow; it takes all day to\r\nmake the sixty miles, but no one is sorry. Occasionally the whistle\r\nis sounded and the boat heads in toward the land, where some camping\r\nparty is on the lookout for mail or a supply of provisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--LOOKING DOWN ON LAKE CHELAN]\r\n\r\nThe lake averages less than two miles in width, and seems all the\r\nnarrower for being shut in between gigantic mountains. For some\r\nmiles we pass under the precipitous cliffs of Goat Mountain, where\r\nformerly numerous herds of mountain goats found pasturage.\r\n\r\nAt every bend in the lake the views become more grand and inspiring.\r\nHere is a dashing stream, roaring in a mad tumble over the boulders\r\ninto the quiet lake--a stream which has its source perhaps a mile\r\nabove, in some snow-bank hidden from sight by the steep, rocky\r\nwalls. Next a waterfall comes into view, pouring over a vertical\r\ncliff into the lake. Occasionally snow-clad peaks appear, but only\r\nto disappear again behind the near mountains. What pleasant spots\r\nwe notice for camping by the ice-cold streams! They are full of\r\nbrook trout, while larger fish are to be found in the lake.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this body of water there is a little hotel for the\r\naccommodation of visitors, and the Stehekin River, which is steadily\r\nat work filling up the lake, hurries past its doors. Since the\r\nmelting of the glacier which once filled the canon, the river has\r\nbuilt a delta fully half a mile out into the water.\r\n\r\nThe lake has the appearance of filling an old river valley or canon.\r\nPerhaps the latter is the better name because the bed is so narrow\r\nand deep. This canon winds among the mountains just like other\r\ncanons in which rivers are flowing, but it has no outlet at the\r\npresent time. In some way a dam has been formed, and the canon,\r\nfilling with water to the top of the dam, has become a lake.\r\n\r\nSoundings have shown that the water is fourteen hundred feet deep;\r\nthat is, a little more than a quarter of a mile. With the exception\r\nof Crater Lake, in Oregon, this is the deepest body of water in\r\nthe United States. It is also interesting to note that the bottom\r\nof the lake is fully three hundred feet below the level of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nHow could a river cut a channel for itself so far below the ocean\r\nlevel? Rivers cannot do work of this kind unless they have a swift\r\ncurrent; moreover, as they empty into the ocean, their beds must be\r\nabove sea level. Some people think that the great glacier, which\r\ncertainly at some time occupied the depression in which the lake\r\nlies, dug out the canon. This glacier was over three thousand feet\r\nin thickness, for the rocks are grooved and polished to a height\r\nof nearly two thousand feet above the surface of the water. It\r\nis, nevertheless, improbable that the glacier did anything more\r\nthan deepen and widen the canon somewhat. It was certainly made,\r\nas we at first supposed, by a river which flowed through it at\r\nsome remote period. At that time the land of our Pacific coast must\r\nhave stood many hundred feet higher than it does now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--GOAT MOUNTAIN, NORTH SHORE OF LAKE CHELAN]\r\n\r\nThe surface of Lake Chelan is a little more than three hundred\r\nfeet above the bed of the Columbia River, which flows through a\r\ndeep canon only three miles distant. If we could remove the dam\r\nof glacial boulders and gravel at the lower end of the lake, the\r\nwater would be lowered only three hundred feet. The lake would\r\nnot be drained, for it is very much deeper. Now here is another\r\npuzzle for us: the bottom of the lake is more than one thousand\r\nfeet below the level of the Columbia. We shall have to go still\r\nfarther back into the past to get a satisfactory explanation this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of years ago there was no plateau filling\r\ncentral Washington, and no Columbia River crossing it. The Cascade\r\nRange stood where we see it to-day, and the region of the plateau\r\nwas a broad valley, toward which flowed the streams that had already\r\ncut canons upon the eastern side of the range. These streams probably\r\nunited in a river emptying westward into the Pacific by a course\r\nnow unknown. The shores of the ocean were farther west than at\r\npresent, for the land stood higher.\r\n\r\nThe canon of Lake Chelan was made by a river of this period, which\r\nthrough many long years gradually deepened and enlarged its channel.\r\nThe river worked just as we see rivers working at the present time,\r\nfor throughout all the history of the earth rivers have not changed\r\ntheir habits. Then came the long period of volcanic eruptions. Our\r\nNorthwest was flooded by fiery lava, which built up the Columbia\r\nplateau and buried under thousands of feet of rock the old river\r\nvalley into which the canon of Chelan emptied.\r\n\r\nThen streams of water began to flow over the plateau from the higher\r\nmountains above the reach of the lava. These streams formed the\r\nColumbia River, which sought the easiest way to the sea, and finally\r\nexcavated a canon for hundreds of miles. In a portion of its course\r\nthe river came close to the edge of the Cascade Range. The ancient\r\ncanon of Lake Chelan had been dammed up by the lava, and a lake\r\noccupied a portion of the former bed of the river. The Columbia\r\ncould not cut its channel deep enough to drain the lake, and there\r\nit remained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--LOOKING DOWN LAKE CHELAN FROM THE UPPER\r\nEND]\r\n\r\nThen another change came: the climate grew cold and heavy snows\r\ngathered upon the Cascade Range. The snow did not all melt during\r\nthe summers, but went on increasing from year to year. The masses\r\nof snow moved gradually down the mountain slopes, growing more\r\nand more icy until they became true glaciers.\r\n\r\nIn this manner it came about that a river of ice occupied the canon\r\nin which the old lake lay, and, displacing its waters, scraped\r\nand ground out the bottom and sides. The moving ice deposited the\r\nwaste material at the lower end of the canon, where it joined the\r\nColumbia River, the canon of which was also occupied by a glacier\r\ncoming from farther north. When the glacier began to retreat up the\r\nChelan canon, it left a great mass of rock debris, forming a dam\r\nbetween its basin and the Columbia. After the ice had disappeared,\r\nwater collected in the canon above the dam, and the narrow, deep\r\nlake was formed, enclosed within granite walls.\r\n\r\nAs the snows melted, forests spread over the mountains, the bear,\r\ndeer, and mountain goats came back again, while the streams, bringing\r\ndown earth and rocks, began their work of filling up the lake. This\r\ntask they will succeed in accomplishing some day unless something\r\nunforeseen happens to prevent. A valley, composed partly of meadow\r\nand partly of boulder-covered slopes, will then have taken the\r\nplace of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nThe explorers and early settlers found a native race occupying nearly\r\nevery portion of our continent. These people had many characteristics\r\nin common and were all called Indians. It is believed that they came\r\noriginally from Asia, but their migration and scattering occurred\r\nso long ago that they have become divided into many groups, each\r\nhaving its own language and customs.\r\n\r\nIn the western portion of the country, where the surface is broken\r\nby numerous barriers, such as mountains and deserts, almost every\r\nvalley was found to be occupied by a distinct group of Indians\r\ncalled a \"tribe.\" The language of each tribe differed so much from\r\nthe languages of adjoining tribes that they could with difficulty\r\nunderstand one another. These tribes were almost continually at\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe Indians upon the Pacific slope were generally found to be inferior\r\nin most respects to those living in the central and eastern portions\r\nof the continent. One might suppose that the tribes possessing the\r\nfair and fertile valleys of California would be the most advanced\r\nin civilization, but such was not the case. Many of them were among\r\nthe most degraded upon the continent. They seemed unable to adapt\r\nthemselves to the white man and his ways, and in the older settled\r\ndistricts they have now nearly disappeared. In the newer portions\r\nof the Northwest and along the coast toward Alaska the Indians\r\nhave not yet come into so direct contact with the white men, and\r\nremain more nearly in their primitive condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians of central California were first seen, they wore\r\nbut little clothing, and knew how to construct only the simplest\r\ndwellings for protection from the weather. They did not cultivate\r\nthe soil, nor did they hunt a great deal, although the country\r\nabounded with game. Along the larger streams fish was an important\r\narticle of food, but in other places, acorns, pine nuts, and roots\r\nconstituted the main supplies. The acorns were ground in stone\r\nmortars and made into soup or into a kind of bread. These Indians\r\nhave often been called Diggers because they depended so largely\r\nfor their living upon the roots which they dug.\r\n\r\nIt would seem natural that about San Francisco Bay the natives\r\nshould have used canoes, but, according to early travellers, they\r\nhad none. When they wished to go out upon the water they built\r\nrafts of bundles of rushes or tules tied together.\r\n\r\nAt favorable points along the shore the Indians collected for their\r\nfeasts, and these spots are now indicated by heaps of shells, in\r\nsome places forming mounds of considerable size. Many interesting\r\nimplements have been dug from these mounds, or kitchen middens\r\nas they are sometimes called. In the mountains the sites of the\r\nvillages are marked by chips of obsidian (a volcanic glass used in\r\nmaking arrow-tips) and by holes in the flat surfaces of granitic\r\nrocks near some spring or stream. These holes were made for the\r\npurpose of grinding acorns or nuts.\r\n\r\nMany of the Indian tribes developed great skill in the weaving of\r\nbaskets, which they used for many different purposes. The baskets\r\nare still made in some places, and are much sought after because\r\nof their beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of northern California in building their homes dug\r\nround, shallow holes, over which poles were bent in the form of\r\na half-circle, and then tied together at the top. Bark was laid\r\nupon the outside, and earth was thrown over the whole structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--HOLES IN ROCK, MADE FOR GRINDING FOOD]\r\n\r\n\"Sweat houses\" were built in much the same manner, and were used\r\nchiefly during the winter. When an Indian wished to take a sweat,\r\nhot stones were placed in one of these houses, and after he had\r\nentered and all openings were closed, he poured water upon the\r\nstones until the room was filled with steam. After enduring this\r\nprocess as long as he desired, the Indian came out and plunged\r\ninto the cold water of a near-by stream. As may be imagined, such\r\na bath often resulted disastrously to the weak or sick.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the California Indians could support themselves without\r\nany great exertion undoubtedly had the effect of making them indolent,\r\nwhile in the desert regions of the Great Basin the struggle for\r\nsomething to eat was so severe that it kept the natives in a degraded\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--CALIFORNIA INDIAN BASKET]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Columbia basin built better houses than those\r\nfarther south. Where wood was abundant their homes were similar\r\nin some respects to those of the coast Indians north of the mouth\r\nof the Columbia. Fish was their main article of diet. At certain\r\nseasons of the year, when salmon were plentiful, each tribe or\r\ngroup of Indians established its camp near one of the many rapids\r\nand waterfalls along the Columbia River. Large numbers of the salmon\r\nwere caught by the use of traps. After being partly dried they\r\nwere packed in bales for winter use. The fish thus prepared were\r\nconsidered very valuable and formed an article of trade with the\r\ntribes living farther from the river.\r\n\r\nThe Indians inhabiting the coast northward from the mouth of the\r\nColumbia were different in many respects from those farther south\r\nor inland. They built better homes, took more pains with their\r\nclothing, were skilled in the making of canoes, and showed marked\r\nability in navigating the stormy waters of the channels and sounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--HESQUIAT INDIAN VILLAGE\r\n\r\nNootka Sound, Vancouver Island]\r\n\r\nThe Vancouver Island Indians are called Nootkas, from the name of\r\nan important tribe upon the west coast. Those of Queen Charlotte\r\nIslands, still farther north, are known as Haidas. These two groups\r\nare very similar. They live upon the shores of densely wooded,\r\nmountainous lands and travel little except by water. Some of the\r\ncanoes which these tribes construct are over fifty feet long and\r\nwill easily carry from fifty to one hundred persons. Such a canoe\r\nis hewn out of a single cedar log, and presents a very graceful\r\nappearance with its upward-curving bow. In these boats the Indians\r\ntake trips of hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--FLATHEAD INDIAN WOMAN, VANCOUVER ISLAND]\r\n\r\nA ride in one of the large canoes is an interesting experience.\r\nWhen a party starts out to visit the neighboring villages, carrying\r\ninvitations to a festival, the men are gayly dressed, and shout and\r\nsing in unison as they ply their paddles. The great canoe jumps\r\nup and onward like a living thing at every stroke of the paddles,\r\nwhich are dipped into the water all at once as the rowers keep\r\ntime to their songs. But this enthusiasm quickly disappears if\r\na head wind comes up, and the party goes ashore to wait for the\r\nbreeze to turn in a more favorable direction.\r\n\r\nThese Indians, as might be supposed, live largely upon fish. Berries\r\nare abundant during the summer and are also much used for food.\r\nThe clothing of the Indians was originally a sort of blanket made\r\nof the woven fibres of cedar bark, or more rarely, of the skins of\r\nanimals, although among the northern tribes skins were used almost\r\nexclusively. Matting made of the cedar bark is still in common use\r\nin their houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--INDIAN HOUSES, FORT RUPERT, VANCOUVER ISLAND]\r\n\r\nAmong the Vancouver Island Indians, a few have peculiarly flattened\r\nforeheads (Fig. 64). This deformity is produced by binding a piece\r\nof board upon the forehead in babyhood and leaving it there while\r\nthe head is growing.\r\n\r\nThe villages are located in some protected spot where the canoes\r\ncan lie in safety. The buildings are strung along the shore close\r\nunder the edge of the thick forest and just above the reach of\r\nthe waves at high tide. They are very solidly constructed, for\r\nthese Indians do not move about as much as those farther south\r\nwhere the forests are less dense. Figure 65 shows the framework of\r\na partially built house, while another stands at one side completed.\r\nLarge posts are set in the ground at the corners and ends of the\r\nbuilding; cross logs are then placed upon the middle posts, and\r\nupon these a huge log is placed for a ridge-pole. This is sometimes\r\ntwo feet in diameter and from sixty to eighty feet long. It must\r\nrequire the united strength of many men to roll such a log into\r\nposition. Upon the framework thus constructed split cedar boards\r\nare fastened, and the building is practically finished. Such a house\r\nis usually occupied by a number of families. Upon Queen Charlotte\r\nIslands there is a dwelling of this kind large enough to hold seven\r\nhundred Indians.\r\n\r\nThe fronts of the houses are ornamented with figures hewn out of\r\nwood. These represent men, birds and animals and have a religious\r\nsignificance. Sometimes these figures are mounted upon the tops\r\nof tall poles.\r\n\r\nThe \"totem pole\" is a most interesting affair. Figure 66 represents\r\nthe pole at Alert Bay, east of Vancouver Island. It is one of the\r\nfinest upon the north coast. The figures of animals and birds carved\r\nupon it represent the mythological ancestors of the family or clan\r\nin front of whose abode the pole stands. The Indians often hunt\r\nsimilar animals to-day, but believe that their ancestors had\r\nsupernatural power which raised them above the ordinary creatures.\r\n\r\nThe Chinook Indians live upon the lower Columbia. The name \"chinook\"\r\nhas been given to a warm, dry wind which blows down the eastern\r\nslope of the Rocky Mountains and out upon the Great Plains. This\r\nwind is so named because it blows from the direction of the Chinook\r\nIndians' country. The \"Chinook\" jargon is a strange sort of mixed\r\nlanguage with which nearly all the tribes of the Northwest are\r\nfamiliar. It is formed of words from the Chinook language, together\r\nwith others from different Indian languages, French-Canadian, and\r\nEnglish. Through the influence of the trappers and traders the\r\n\"Chinook\" has come into wide use, so that by means of it conversation\r\ncan be carried on with tribes speaking different languages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--TOTEM POLE\r\n\r\nAlert Bay, British Columbia]\r\n\r\nAlthough there are so many different tribes, with great diversities\r\nof language, throughout the West, they were probably all derived\r\nfrom the same source. As we go north the similarity between the\r\ncoast Indians and the inhabitants of eastern Asia becomes more\r\nnoticeable. It seems almost certain that these American Indians\r\noriginally came across the narrow strip of water separating Asia\r\nfrom America.\r\n\r\nWe do not know how long the Indians have occupied our country,\r\nbut it has probably been several thousand years. Some of the main\r\ngroups have undoubtedly been here longer than others.\r\n\r\nUnless we protect the Indians and permit them so far as possible\r\nto lead their own natural lives, most of them will soon disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LEWIS AND CLARK\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century it appeared likely that France would\r\nbefore long control the northern and interior portion of North\r\nAmerica. La Salle discovered the Ohio River, traversed the Great\r\nLakes, and descended the Mississippi River to its mouth. In 1742\r\nother French explorers pushed west from the Great Lakes and sighted\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. But when the English triumphed at Quebec, France\r\ngave up to them all of her possessions east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and ceded the province of Louisiana to the Spanish. This\r\nprovince was very much larger than the state which now bears the\r\nname. Bounded by the Mississippi River upon the east, and the Spanish\r\npossessions upon the southwest, it stretched north and west with\r\nvery indefinite boundaries, although in the latter direction it\r\nwas supposed to be limited by the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAt one time Napoleon dreamed of founding a great colony in America,\r\nand induced Spain to cede Louisiana back to the French; but being\r\nunable to carry out his plans, he made a proposition to the United\r\nStates to take this territory. His offer was accepted, and in 1803,\r\nduring the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the vast province was\r\ntaken into the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately evident that more definite knowledge should\r\nbe acquired concerning the great region beyond the Mississippi,\r\nparticularly the portion about the head of the Missouri River.\r\nThe unknown region lying between the source of this river and the\r\nPacific should also be explored, for Captain Gray's discovery of\r\nthe Columbia River gave to the United States a claim upon this\r\npart of the continent which must be maintained. If something were\r\nnot done soon, the territory would be occupied by the English fur\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nTwo young men, Captains Lewis and Clark, were chosen to lead an\r\nexpedition into the Northwest, which proved to be one of the most\r\nremarkable in the history of our country. They were the first white\r\nmen to cross the Rocky Mountains and to traverse the continent\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific within the present boundaries of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nHow interesting it must have been to push into the Rocky Mountains,\r\nbeyond the farthest point previously reached by white men; to see\r\nNature in her wild state, to note the new plants and animals, and\r\nto study the Indians before their contact with Europeans had changed\r\ntheir customs!\r\n\r\nLewis and Clark were particularly instructed to investigate the\r\nsources of the Missouri, to learn how the continental divide could\r\nbe crossed, and to ascertain the nature of the streams which flowed\r\nwestward to the Pacific. They were also to study the resources\r\nof the country, and to examine into the character and customs of\r\nall the Indian tribes that they should meet.\r\n\r\nThe start was made from St. Louis in May, 1804, with two large\r\nrowboats and one sail-boat. The latter was to return with news of\r\nthe party when the farthest outpost upon the Missouri was reached.\r\n\r\nThrough the summer months and late into the fall the boats toiled\r\nup the river against the swift current, finally reaching a village\r\nof the Mandan Indians in the present state of North Dakota, where\r\nthe explorers spent the winter. Thus far they were in a region\r\nfrequently visited by the traders and trappers from St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--THE GREAT FALLS OF THE MISSOURI]\r\n\r\nIn the spring they pushed on again in canoes, at length entering\r\nan unknown region. The Missouri forked so frequently that it was\r\noften difficult to determine which was the main stream. To the\r\nsurprise of the travellers, the country appeared to be uninhabited,\r\nso that they could get no assistance from the Indians. Only a small\r\nstock of provisions remained, and as the party numbered about thirty,\r\nit was necessary to keep hunters out in advance all the time.\r\n\r\nAs we are carried swiftly through this region to-day in the cars,\r\nno signs of wild creatures are to be seen, and it is difficult for\r\nus to believe that game was once abundant. The narrative of the\r\nexpedition abounds with descriptions of various large animals which\r\nthe explorers met in herds, such as deer, antelope, buffalo, bears,\r\nand wolves. The bears, both white and brown, were very numerous\r\nand bold. The white bears in particular were so ferocious that the\r\nhunters had many serious encounters with them. They would sometimes\r\nenter the camp at night, and at one time a herd of buffalo stampeded\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nWhen undecided at one point which branch of the river to follow,\r\nCaptain Lewis went some distance in advance and discovered the\r\nGreat Falls of the Missouri. He was greatly impressed and awed\r\nby the magnitude and height of the successive falls, which were\r\ntwenty-four, forty-seven, and eighty feet high respectively, and\r\nwere connected by a series of cascades.\r\n\r\nMany days were spent there in a long and laborious portage, for\r\neverything had to be carried a distance of twelve miles before\r\nthe quiet water above the falls was reached.\r\n\r\nHow the coming of the white man has changed the region about the\r\nfalls! The game has disappeared; an important city, supported by\r\nthe enormous water-power, is growing up; while the smoke rising\r\nfrom extensive plants for reducing the gold, silver, and copper\r\nores mined in the Rocky Mountains floats out over the country.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the river, the party reached the Gate of the Mountains--a\r\npicturesque spot where the stream leaves the mountains through\r\na narrow defile between high and jagged cliffs and enters upon\r\nits long course across the Great Plains (Fig. 68). Gradually the\r\nriver became smaller, and at last the travellers came to the point\r\nwhere it divided into three branches, to which they gave the names\r\nof Gallatin, Madison, and Jefferson forks. The party made their\r\nway up the latter fork, which flowed from a westerly direction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: FIG. 68.--THE GATE OF THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River at the entrance to the Rocky Mountains]\r\n\r\nNow they began to look anxiously for the Indians, from whom it\r\nwould be necessary to get horses to transport their baggage when\r\nthe river should become too small for the canoes. This region was\r\ninhabited by the Shoshones. It may well be asked how it happened that\r\nthese Indians had horses, since no white people had ever visited them\r\nbefore. Their purchase of horses came about through the processes\r\nof trade with the tribes to the south, who in turn came in contact\r\nwith the Spanish of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nOne or the other of the leaders kept in advance, on the lookout for\r\nthe Indians. At last Captain Lewis, while crossing the divide at\r\nthe head of the stream which they had been following, came suddenly\r\nupon several Indians. After overcoming their fear by presents, he\r\naccompanied them to their camp and induced them to return with\r\nhorses to assist the party.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the Pacific side of the continental divide the explorers\r\nwere in doubt as to which way to proceed. No man had been before them,\r\nand the Indians told stories of fearful deserts to the southwest\r\n(probably the Snake River plains), and said that the mountains were\r\ntoo steep for the horses, and the rivers too rapid for canoes.\r\n\r\nIf you will examine a map of the country about the head of the\r\nJefferson fork of the Missouri, you will not wonder that Captains\r\nLewis and Clark were in doubt as to which way they should go in\r\norder to reach the Columbia. They first attempted to go down the\r\nSalmon River, but soon gave up this project. They turned about\r\nand crossed the mountains to the Bitter Root River, which flows\r\nnorth and empties into Lake Pend d'Oreille through Clark's Fork\r\nof the Columbia.\r\n\r\nAfter going down the Bitter Root for a short distance they turned\r\nwest again across the Bitter Root Mountains and came out upon the\r\nhead waters of the Kooskooskie River. Unable to follow its canons,\r\nthey wandered to the north among the mountains. At this time their\r\nsufferings were intense. Food became so scarce that they were obliged\r\nto eat their horses. After many weary days they again reached the\r\nstream, but this time at a point where it was navigable. They floated\r\ndown to its junction with the Lewis or Snake River, where the growing\r\ncity of Lewiston now stands. At this point they met the Nez Perces\r\nIndians, who assisted them in every possible way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--CELILO FALLS, COLUMBIA RIVER]\r\n\r\nThe party continued down the Snake River in canoes until they finally\r\nreached the Columbia. The difficulties of navigation were great,\r\nfor at intervals of every few miles the river was broken by rapids\r\nthrough which it was dangerous to take the canoes. By treating\r\nthe Indians kindly, the party succeeded in trading with them for\r\nsuch articles of food as horses and dogs. They also obtained some\r\nsalmon. The presence of this fish in the streams gave them the\r\nfirst assurance that the Pacific slope had been reached. Along\r\nthe Columbia River salmon was one of the chief articles of food\r\nfor the Indians.\r\n\r\nAt Celilo Falls, a short distance above the present city of The\r\nDalles, the travellers found great difficulty in proceeding, as\r\nthe canoes and loads had to be carried, or \"portaged,\" around the\r\nfalls. Lewis and Clark called these the Great Falls of the Columbia\r\n(Fig. 69).\r\n\r\nAs the canoes floated down through the magnificent canon by which\r\nthe Columbia passes the Cascade Range, they encountered another\r\nrapid, now known as the Cascades of the Columbia. This rapid is\r\ndue to a great landslide which has formed a dam across the river.\r\nCaptain Lewis speaks of the broken trunks of trees rising from\r\nthe water above the dam, a fact which would lead one to suppose\r\nthat it had not been very long since the slide occurred.\r\n\r\nBelow the Cascades the party soon began to notice the influence\r\nof the tides in the rise and fall of the river, and knew then that\r\nthe Pacific could not be very far away. Early in November they\r\ncame in sight of the ocean, and in a few days had the pleasure\r\nof standing upon its shores. The long and dangerous trip of four\r\nthousand miles had been completed without any serious accident.\r\n\r\nContinual rains poured upon them, and before winter quarters could\r\nbe prepared they were in a very uncomfortable position. A permanent\r\ncamp was selected upon the Oregon side of the Columbia, and log\r\nbuildings were erected. The camp was called Fort Clatsop. While\r\nin their winter quarters the party cultivated friendly relations\r\nwith the Indians, and made extensive notes upon their habits and\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--THE CASCADES OF THE COLUMBIA\r\n\r\nA steamer going up to the locks]\r\n\r\nIn the spring, since no ship had appeared which would carry them\r\nback by water, Lewis and Clark determined to return overland. First,\r\nhowever, they left some records with the Indians, with directions\r\nthat these should be given to the captain of any ship which might\r\nhappen to visit the mouth of the Columbia. The leaders wished to\r\nmake sure that if anything happened to the party the knowledge\r\ngained by their explorations should not be lost.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine with what pleasure the men turned homeward. Although\r\nthey had started with flour, rice, corn, and other articles of food,\r\nthese had given out long before they reached the lower Columbia, and\r\nfor some months their only diet had been fish and the animals that\r\nthe hunters had killed. Their stock for trading with the Indians\r\nwas also nearly gone; all the articles that were left could be put\r\ninto two pocket handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending the Columbia River to a point above The Dalles, the\r\nparty left the stream, as they found that it would be impossible to\r\nmake much headway with the canoes. Obtaining horses from the Indians,\r\nthey followed the outward route back as far as the Kooskooskie River.\r\nThen they turned north and crossed the mountains to the Missoula\r\nRiver. Near the present city of Missoula the party divided, Captain\r\nLewis going up Hell Gate River and crossing the continental divide\r\nto examine the country lying north of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark, with another portion of the company, went up the\r\nBitter Root River and over the mountains to the Jefferson Fork,\r\nwhich the whole party had ascended the year before. He followed\r\nthis river down to its junction with the Gallatin, and travelled\r\nfor a distance up the latter stream, then crossed by land to the\r\nYellowstone River.\r\n\r\nCanoes were constructed upon the Yellowstone, and the party floated\r\ndown to the junction of this river with the Missouri. There the two\r\nbands were fortunately reunited, and together they passed rapidly\r\ndown the Missouri until they reached the \"village\" of St. Louis,\r\nwhere the whole population came out to welcome them. As the party\r\nhad been gone more than two years, it was feared that they would\r\nnever be heard from again.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the expedition of Lewis and Clark added\r\ngreatly to the public interest in the vast region which they traversed,\r\nand helped to bring about the final retention of the Oregon country.\r\nThe Hudson Bay Fur Company soon after established trading posts at\r\nvarious points along the Columbia, and kept up their contention\r\nthat all the country lying north of the river rightfully belonged\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nIt was very remarkable that the Lewis and Clark expedition had\r\nmade the long journey to the Pacific and back without meeting with\r\nserious accident. There were perils to be met on account of the\r\nruggedness of the country, the rapids in the streams, the lack of\r\nfood, and the danger of attack from the Indians. The successful\r\naccomplishment of the plan was without a doubt largely due to the\r\nability of the two brave leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIANS IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nHow many of us know that the Russians once established a post upon\r\nthe coast of California and held it for nearly a third of a century?\r\nIf the geographic conditions about this post had been different, it\r\nis possible that the Russian colonists would hold their position\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries made upon the North American coast by the Russian\r\nnavigator, Bering, in 1741, led to fur trading with the Indians; and\r\nin 1798 the Russian American company was organized and established\r\nits headquarters at Sitka.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards still claimed the whole Pacific coast of North America\r\nas far north as the Strait of Fuca, though they had given up their\r\nstation at Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island. They had, however, made\r\nno settlements north of the port of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one hundred years ago that Rezanof, a leading Russian\r\nofficial, arrived at Sitka and began to investigate the condition\r\nof the settlements of the Russian American Fur Company. He found\r\nthem in a sorry state; the people were nearly starved and most\r\nof them were sick with the scurvy. No grain or vegetables were\r\ngrown along that northern coast, nor could they be supplied from\r\nAsia. Rezanof conceived the idea of establishing trade relations\r\nwith the people of California. By this means furs might be exchanged\r\nfor the fresh provisions which were so sorely needed in the north.\r\n\r\nRezanof sailed south in 1806 and tried to enter the Columbia River,\r\nwhere the company had planned to establish a settlement, for upon\r\nthe Russian maps of this time all of the coast as far south as the\r\nColumbia was included under Russian jurisdiction. Rezanof was,\r\nhowever, unable to enter the river, probably for the same reason that\r\nMeares, the English navigator, had failed to enter. He then proceeded\r\ndown the coast and finally ran into the port of San Francisco, where\r\nhe was treated in a fairly polite manner by the Spanish.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the expedition to the north, definite plans\r\nwere made for the establishment of an agricultural and trading\r\nstation on the California coast, as a permanent supply depot for\r\nthe northern settlements. Rezanof hoped in time to secure a portion\r\nof this fair southern land from Spain.\r\n\r\nSeveral hunting expeditions, chiefly made up of Aleut Indians with\r\nRussian officers, were sent south and told to keep a sharp lookout\r\nfor a suitable place to begin operations. In 1809 one expedition\r\nentered Bodega Bay, an inlet of some size about sixty miles northwest\r\nof San Francisco. This bay, which had been previously discovered and\r\nnamed by the Spaniards, was thoroughly explored two years later.\r\n\r\nNo good spot for a settlement was found upon this inlet, but in\r\n1812 a location was determined upon, ten miles north of the mouth\r\nof the stream we now know as Russian River. There was no good harbor\r\nhere, simply a little cove, but back of this cove a broad grassy\r\ntract formed a gently sloping terrace at the foot of a line of\r\nhills. The soil was good and timber was near at hand.\r\n\r\nThe Russians first made friends with the Indians, who ceded to\r\nthem the territory in the neighborhood for three blankets, three\r\npair of breeches, three hoes, two axes, and some trinkets.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect themselves from possible Indian attacks as\r\nwell as to be able to hold their position against the Spanish,\r\nthe Russians constructed a strong stockade. It was made of upright\r\nposts set in the ground and pierced with loopholes. At the corners,\r\nand a little distance within, were erected two hexagonal blockhouses\r\nwith openings for cannon. As it happened, however, no occasion\r\never arose for the use of the ten cannon with which the fort was\r\nsupplied. The post was given the name Ross, a word which forms\r\nthe root of the word Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish, of course, claimed the territory by right of discovery,\r\nand watched the work of the Russians with jealous eyes. They were\r\nnot strong enough to drive the Russians away by force, although\r\nthey protested more than once against the unlawful occupation of\r\nthe land. Some trading was carried on between the Russians and\r\nthe Spanish, and occasionally loads of grain and cattle were sent\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe number of people at Fort Ross varied from one hundred and fifty\r\nto five hundred. The population consisted of Russians, Aleuts,\r\nand other Indians. The Aleuts were the hunters and sealers. They\r\nspent their time upon the ocean, sometimes entering San Francisco\r\nBay, but usually hunting in the region of the Farralone Islands,\r\nwhich were originally inhabited by great herds of fur seal. There\r\nwere also otters, sea-lions, and an infinite number of seabirds. A\r\nstation was maintained upon the Farralones, where a few men stayed\r\nto gather birds' eggs and kill seagulls. Many thousands of gulls\r\nwere taken each year, and every part of their bodies was utilized\r\nfor some purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--FORT ROSS FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\nSchooner loading wood]\r\n\r\nKotzebue, a Russian navigator, whose name has been given to a sound\r\nupon northern Alaska, visited Fort Ross and also San Francisco Bay.\r\nHe considered it a great pity that the Russians had not gained\r\npossession of this territory before the Spaniards, for the magnificent\r\nbay of San Francisco, in the midst of a fertile country, would have\r\nbeen a prize worth working for.\r\n\r\nYear after year the Russian Fur Company sent expeditions to California\r\nto trade and bring back provisions. They tried to extend the area\r\nunder their jurisdiction, but the geographical conditions of the\r\ncountry were unfavorable. The narrow strip of land next the coast\r\nwas cut off from the interior valleys by mountain ridges and canons.\r\nIf the Sonoma Valley had opened westward instead of toward San\r\nFrancisco Bay, it would have been easy to extend their territory\r\ngradually. As it was, the Spanish, who were in control of the bay,\r\nhad easy access to all of the fertile valleys of central California.\r\n\r\nAs the sealing industry decreased in importance, and as the maintenance\r\nof Fort Ross was expensive, the Russians in 1839 began to consider\r\nthe question of giving up their post. They finally sold everything\r\nat Ross and Bodega, except the land, to Sutter, an American who\r\nhad acquired a large ranch and established a post or fort at the\r\nmouth of the American River. In 1841 the Russians sailed away,\r\nnever to return. The Spaniards were greatly relieved when this\r\nhappened, for they had not known how to get rid of their unwelcome\r\nneighbors peaceably, and were reluctant to stir up trouble with\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe stockade at Fort Ross has entirely disappeared, but two blockhouses,\r\nthe little chapel, and the officers' quarters remain as the Russians\r\nleft them.\r\n\r\nFort Ross is now-a pleasant, quiet hamlet. A store and a farm-house\r\nhave been added to the old buildings. Behind the sloping meadows\r\nrise the partly wooded hills, while in front lies the little bay\r\nwhere once the boats of the Russian and Aleut seal hunters moved\r\nto and fro. Occasionally a small schooner visits the cove for the\r\npurpose of loading wood or tan-bark for the San Francisco market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--RUSSIAN BLOCKHOUSE, FORT ROSS]\r\n\r\nFort Ross was never marked by serious strife and seems destined to\r\ngo on in its quiet way. The blockhouses are rotting and beginning\r\nto lean with age, and in time all evidences of the once formidable\r\nRussian post will have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH VALLEY\r\n\r\nTo most of us Death Valley is thought of only as a mysterious region\r\nsomewhere in the Southwest, a place which we are accustomed to\r\npicture to ourselves as being the embodiment of everything that\r\nis desolate and lifeless,--a region where there is no water, where\r\nthere are no living things, simply bare rocks and sand upon which\r\nthe sun beats pitilessly and over which the scorching winds blow\r\nin clouds of dust. The reality is hardly so bad as this, for there\r\nare living things in the valley, and water may occasionally be\r\nfound. Nevertheless it is a fearful spot in summer, and has become\r\nthe final resting place of many wanderers in these desert regions,\r\nwho having drunk all their water failed to find more.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned something about the Great Basin: we know\r\nthat it is made up of vast desert plains or valleys, separated by\r\na few partly isolated mountain ranges. The valleys are peculiar\r\nin that they are basins without outlets, and for this reason are\r\nknown as sinks. Many of the lakes once occupying the valleys are\r\nnow quite or nearly dry, and the lower portions of their beds are\r\neither whitened with deposits of borax and soda, or have been\r\ntransformed into barren expanses of hardened yellow clay.\r\n\r\nThe long, gentle slopes about the sinks, which have been built up\r\nby the waste rock from the mountains, as a result of the occasional\r\ncloudbursts are dotted with sage-brush, greasewood, or other low\r\nplants, and furnish a home for numerous animals.\r\n\r\nBack of the gravel slopes rise the mountains, browned under the\r\nfierce rays of the summer sun. In some of their deeper canons little\r\nsprings and streams are found, but the water usually dries up before\r\nleaving the protecting shadows of the cliffs. Toward the mountain\r\ntops the desert juniper appears; and if the peaks rise high enough\r\nto get more of the moisture of the cooler air, they support groves\r\nof the pinon and possibly yellow pine.\r\n\r\nThe valleys are all much alike. In summer the days are unbearably\r\nhot, while in winter the air is cool and invigorating. The skies\r\nare overcast for only a few days in the year, but in the autumn\r\nand spring fierce winds, laden with dust and sand, sweep across\r\nthe valleys and through the mountain passes.\r\n\r\nStrange rock forms, of many contrasting colors, worn out by wind\r\nand water, mark the desert mountains. The granite wears a brown,\r\nsunburned coat, while the masses of black lava show here and there\r\npatches of pink, yellow, and red. The air is often so wondrously\r\nclear that distant mountains seem much nearer than they really\r\nare. During the hot summer days the mirage forms apparent lakes and\r\nshady groves, illusions which have lured many a thirsty traveller\r\nto his death.\r\n\r\nDeath Valley is the lowest and hottest of the desert basins. Its\r\nsurface, over four hundred feet below the level of the sea, is\r\nthe lowest dry land in the United States. The valley is long and\r\nnarrow and enclosed by mountains. Those upon the east are known\r\nas the Funeral Mountains, while upon the west the peaks of the\r\nPanamint Range rise to a height of about ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIf the rainfall were greater, Death Valley would be occupied by a\r\nsalt or alkaline lake, but in this dry region lakes cannot exist,\r\nand the bottom of the sink, sometimes marshy after exceptional\r\nwinter rains, is in many places almost snowy white from deposits\r\nof salt, soda, or borax.\r\n\r\nDeath Valley, then, differs from scores of other valleys in the\r\nGreat Basin by being a little lower, a little hotter, and a little\r\nmore arid. Strange as it may seem, old prospectors say that Death\r\nValley is the best watered of all the desert valleys. Since it is\r\nthe lowest spot in all the surrounding country, the scanty water\r\nsupply all flows toward it. But the water runs under the gravels\r\nof the old river beds instead of on the top, where it might be\r\nutilized. Occasionally, however, the water comes to the surface in\r\nthe form of springs, which are marked by a few willows or mesquite\r\ntrees and little patches of salt grass.\r\n\r\nLong ago, when the rainfall was greater, Death Valley was a saline\r\nlake and received a number of streams, two of which were large enough\r\nto be called rivers. The Amargoza River, starting from Nevada and\r\npursuing a roundabout way, entered the southern end of the valley.\r\nThe Mohave River, which rises in the San Bernardino Range, also\r\nemptied into the valley at one time, but now its waters, absorbed\r\nby the thirsty air and by the sands, disappear in the sink of the\r\nMohave fifty miles to the south.\r\n\r\nThe summer is the dreaded season in Death Valley. A temperature\r\nof one hundred and thirty-seven degrees has been reported by the\r\nPacific Coast Borax Company at the mouth of Furnace Creek. This\r\ntemperature was recorded in the shade, and is the hottest ever\r\nexperienced in the United States. In the sun it is of course much\r\nhotter. Many a person has lost his life in trying to cross the\r\nheated valley in the middle of a summer day instead of making the\r\njourney at night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--ENTERING DEATH VALLEY]\r\n\r\nDangerous as this region is, even now when we know so much about\r\nit, it was of course much more dangerous for the first white men\r\nwho entered it. Only those who have had some experience upon the\r\ndesert can realize the difficulties and dangers which beset the\r\nfirst emigrants who attempted to cross the deserts lying between\r\nSalt Lake City and the Sierra Nevada mountains. The story of the\r\nsufferings and final escape of that party which, by taking the\r\nwrong course, was lost in the great sink, is extremely interesting\r\nalthough sad. The valley received its name from the experiences\r\nof the members of this party.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1849 many emigrants, who had reached Salt\r\nLake City too late in the season to take the usual route through\r\nnorthern Nevada and over the Sierra Nevada mountains, decided that\r\nrather than remain in the town all winter, they would follow the\r\nsouth trail across southern Nevada to San Bernardino and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nA party of people finally collected with one hundred and seven\r\nwagons and about five hundred horses and cattle. The course led\r\nin a southwesterly direction past Sevier Lake and Mountain Meadows\r\nin southwestern Utah. In the latter locality the party divided,\r\nthe larger number leaving the old trail and taking a more westerly\r\ndirection. They thought in this way to shorten the distance, and\r\nhoped, by skirting the southern end of the Sierra Nevada mountains,\r\nto-gain the San Joaquin Valley in California.\r\n\r\nNow trouble began. No one had ever been over the new route, and\r\nthe location of the springs and the passes through which the wagons\r\ncould be taken had to be sought out in advance. Soon many of the\r\nparty turned back to the known trail, but the others continued,\r\nthough with no knowledge of the nature of the country which they\r\nmust cross.\r\n\r\nDay after day and week after week the slow ox-teams crawled across\r\nthe broad deserts and over the low mountain ranges. From the top\r\nof each successive mountain ridge the men looked with longing eyes\r\ntoward the west, hoping to get a sight of the snowy Sierras. Finally\r\nwant of water and food began to weaken the cattle and the wagons\r\nwere lightened as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAs the party approached the eastern boundary of California the\r\nmountains grew higher and the deserts more arid. In the clear air\r\nthe snow-covered peaks of the Panamint Range began to be visible,\r\nalthough one hundred miles away. The weary emigrants believed that\r\nthese peaks belonged to the Sierra Nevadas, and that beyond them\r\nlay the green valleys of California. How great was their mistake!\r\nThe Panamint Range looks down upon Death Valley with a bold and\r\nalmost impassable front, while still other broad deserts lie between\r\nthis range and the real Sierras.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the head of the Amargosa River the party began to\r\nseparate, for by this time many thought only of saving their lives\r\nat any cost. Some followed Furnace Creek to its sink in Death Valley;\r\nothers went over the Funeral range and came down upon the lower\r\nportion of the Amargosa River. In many cases the wagons were abandoned\r\nand the oxen were killed for food.\r\n\r\nWhen they came into the sink we now know as Death Valley, the members\r\nof the different parties began to feel that they were really lost.\r\nFrom the records that have come down to us we can see that they had\r\nnot the slightest idea of the direction which they should take or\r\nof their distance from the settlements in California. Fortunately it\r\nwas the winter season and the heat did not trouble them; moreover,\r\nthe rains and snows furnished some water.\r\n\r\nNone of the wagons were taken beyond the camp at the western edge\r\nof the valley, under the towering peaks of the Panamint Range.\r\nThis place is now known as Bennett's Wells. Here the wagons were\r\nbroken up and burned, and the loads, which were now very light,\r\nwere either taken by the men themselves or placed upon the backs\r\nof the few remaining oxen. It was thought that the fair fields\r\nof California would be seen from the top of the Panamint Range;\r\nbut when the travellers reached the summit other desert valleys\r\nappeared in the west, and beyond these, in the dim distance, another\r\nsnowy range was visible.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants now divided into parties. One party reached Owens\r\nLake, and turning south, finally passed over the Sierras by the\r\nway of Walkers Pass and went down the valley of the Kern River.\r\nAnother, the Bennett party, including some women and children,\r\nremained at the springs in Death Valley, while two of the men started\r\nout alone, in the hope of reaching the settlements and returning\r\nwith food. These men crossed the Panamint Range and struggled on\r\nfor days in a southwesterly direction, over desert valleys and\r\nmountains. They were frequently on the point of giving up in despair\r\nfor want of food and water.\r\n\r\nAt last, far to the south, the snowy crest of the San Gabriel Range\r\ncame into sight. Continuing in a southwesterly direction through\r\nthe Mohave Desert, the men reached a low pass in the mountains and\r\nfollowed a stream until they came upon a Mexican ranch, where the\r\nsight of green meadows, upon which horses and cattle were feeding,\r\ndelighted their weary eyes.\r\n\r\nSeveral animals were secured and loaded with food. Then the men\r\nturned back into the desert. They at last reached the desolate\r\nvalley again, after an absence of about a month, and found most of\r\nthe party alive, although nearly driven to despair. With the aid\r\nof a mule and several oxen, the party came safely to the fertile\r\nvalleys near the coast.\r\n\r\nAnother party, known as the Jayhawkers, struggled on behind the\r\ntwo men who went for relief, and the most of its members also came\r\nsafely out of the desert, though not without extreme suffering.\r\nIn all, fourteen people of this expedition perished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--SOUTHERN END OF DEATH VALLEY\r\n\r\nShowing the white deposits of soda]\r\n\r\nIf you ever have an opportunity to travel over this region, you\r\nwill wonder that any of the people escaped. The seemingly endless\r\nsuccession of deserts and mountains, the lack of food, and the\r\nscanty supply of water, often unfit to drink, would lead one to\r\nthink that strangers to these wilds would be far more likely to\r\nperish than to find their way out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIFF DWELLERS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS\r\n\r\nThe region of the high plateaus of the southwestern United States\r\npresents many strange and interesting aspects. Equipped with pack\r\nanimals for the trails, and conducted by a guide who knows the\r\nposition of the springs, one might wander for months over this\r\nrugged and semi-arid region without becoming weary of the wonderful\r\nsights which Nature has prepared.\r\n\r\nIn travelling over the plateau one has to consider that often for\r\nlong distances the precipitous walls of the canons cannot be scaled,\r\nand that the springs are few and inaccessible. To one not acquainted\r\nwith the plateau it appears incapable of supporting human life.\r\nThere is little wild game and scarcely any water to irrigate the\r\ndry soil.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the country is examined closely, the discovery will be\r\nmade that it was once inhabited, though by a people very different\r\nfrom the savage Indians who wandered over it when the white men\r\nfirst came. These early people had permanent homes and were much\r\nmore civilized than the Indians. They lived chiefly by agriculture,\r\ncultivating little patches of land wherever water could be obtained.\r\n\r\nGo in whatever way you will from the meeting point of the four\r\nstates and territories, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico,\r\nand you will find the ruins of houses and forts. Upon the tops of\r\nprecipitous cliffs, in the caves with which the canon walls abound,\r\nby the streams and springs, there are crumbling stone buildings, many\r\nof them of great extent, and once capable of sheltering hundreds\r\nof people. Scattered over the surface of the ground and buried in\r\nthe soil about the ruins are fragments of pottery, stone implements,\r\ncorn-cobs, and in protected spots the remains of corn and squash\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nThe people who once inhabited these ruins have been called Cliff\r\nDwellers, because their homes are so frequently found clinging to\r\nthe cliffs, like the nests of birds, in the caverns and recesses\r\nof the precipitous canon walls. The Cliff Dwellers have left no\r\nwritten records, but from a study of their buildings and of the\r\nmaterials found in them, and from the traces of irrigating ditches,\r\nwe are sure that they were a peaceful, agricultural people.\r\n\r\nThe oldest ruins are probably those in the open and less protected\r\nvalleys. It is evident that after these dwellings had been occupied\r\nfor an indefinite time the more fierce and warlike Indians began\r\nto overrun the plateau region and make attacks upon the primitive\r\ninhabitants. These people, peacefully inclined and probably not\r\nstrong in numbers, could find no protection in the valleys where\r\nthey irrigated little patches of land and raised corn and squashes;\r\nso, retreating to the more inaccessible canons, they became cliff\r\ndwellers. Seeking out the caverns so abundant in these canons,\r\nthey went to work with tireless energy to build for themselves\r\nimpregnable homes and fortresses to which they could retreat when\r\nthe savage Indians appeared.\r\n\r\nThe canon of Beaver Creek in central Arizona contains one of the\r\nmost interesting of these fortresses, known as Montezuma's Castle.\r\nMany small buildings nestle along the sides of the canon upon the\r\nledges and under over-hanging rocks, but Montezuma's Castle is\r\nthe most magnificent of them all, and must have given protection\r\nto a number of families.\r\n\r\nHalfway up the face of a cliff two hundred feet in height, there is\r\na large cavern with an upward sloping floor and jagged overhanging\r\ntop. Here with infinite toil the Cliff Dwellers constructed a fortress,\r\nthe front of which rose forty feet from the foundation and contained\r\nfive stories. This front was not made straight, but concave, to\r\ncorrespond to the curve of the cliff.\r\n\r\nWhat an effort it must have been for these people, who had nothing\r\nbut their hands to work with, to quarry the stone. To carry their\r\nmaterials from the bottom of the canon, by means of rude ladders,\r\nup the steep and rugged wall to the foot of the cavern, and then\r\nto lay the foundation securely upon the sloping floor, must have\r\nbeen a still harder task.\r\n\r\nThe stones were laid in mud, and in most cases were also plastered\r\nwith it. Here and there little holes were left to let in light,\r\nbut the rooms, with their low ceilings, would have seemed very\r\ndismal and dark to us. Beams were set in the walls to support the\r\ndifferent floors. Smaller sticks were laid upon the beams, and\r\nthen a layer of earth was placed over the top.\r\n\r\nTo pass through the openings between the different rooms the inhabitants\r\nhad to crawl upon their hands and knees. The places where they built\r\ntheir fires are indicated by the dark stains which the smoke has\r\nleft upon the walls. Broken pottery and corn-cobs are scattered\r\nprofusely about the building. How safe these ancient people must\r\nhave felt in this retreat, where they were protected, both from\r\nthe storms and from their enemies!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE, BEAVER CREEK CANON,\r\nARIZONA]\r\n\r\nNear some of the ruined dwellings in this region there are remains\r\nof buildings which are supposed to have been watch-towers. We can\r\npicture to ourselves the sentinels' alarm given to the workers in\r\nthe fields at the approach of the savage Apaches, and the hasty\r\nflight of the Cliff Dwellers to the castle far up the canon wall,--the\r\npulling up of the ladders and the retreat to the upper rooms from\r\nwhich they could look down in perfect safety. They must have kept\r\nwater and food stored in the cave houses. As long as these supplies\r\nheld out no injury need be feared from the attacking party.\r\n\r\nBut apparently there came a time when the Cliff Dwellers either\r\nabandoned their gardens and fortresses or were killed. It is possible\r\nthat the climate of the plateau region became more arid and that\r\nmany of the springs dried up, for there is no water now within\r\nlong distances of some of the ruins. It is, perhaps, more probable\r\nthat the attacks of the savages became so frequent that the Cliff\r\nDwellers were driven from their little farms and were no longer\r\nable to procure food.\r\n\r\nThose who were not killed by enemies or by starvation retreated\r\nsouthward and gathered in a few large villages, or pueblos, where\r\nthey were still resisting the attacks of their enemies at the time\r\nof the coming of the early Spanish explorers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--PUEBLO OF TAOS, NEW MEXICO]\r\n\r\nA careful study of the early inhabitants of America reveals the\r\nfact that the Pueblo Indians are the descendants of the race of\r\nCliff Dwellers. Their houses, their pottery, and their religious\r\nceremonies are, so far as can be determined, very similar to those\r\nof the Cliff Dwellers. If you travel through northwestern New Mexico\r\nand northeastern Arizona, you will find the villages situated upon\r\ncommanding rocks which are often surrounded by almost inaccessible\r\ncliffs. To these elevated villages all the food and water has to\r\nbe carried from the valleys below. The houses are solidly built\r\nof stone, and rise, terrace-fashion, several stories in height,\r\neach succeeding story standing a little back of the one below.\r\nThese houses can be entered only by a ladder from the outside. In\r\ntime of danger the ladders are drawn up so that the walls cannot be\r\neasily scaled. There are a number of groups of the Pueblo Indians,\r\nbut the Zuni and Moki are perhaps as interesting as any of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--GRINDING GRAIN, LAGUNA, NEW MEXICO]\r\n\r\nWonderful indeed are some of the pueblo villages which were still\r\noccupied at the time of the coming of the Spanish, more than three\r\ncenturies and a half ago. As in the pueblos now occupied, there\r\nwere no separate family houses. The people of an entire pueblo\r\nlived in one great building of many rooms. Some of the pueblos\r\nwere semi-circular, with a vertical wall upon the outside, while\r\nupon the inside the successive stories formed a series of huge\r\nsteps similar to the tiers of seats in an ancient amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--THE ENCHANTED MESA\r\n\r\nThe summit was once the site of an Indian pueblo]\r\n\r\nIn the pueblo of Pecos were the largest buildings of this kind ever\r\ndiscovered. One had three hundred and seventeen rooms, and another\r\nfive hundred and eighty-five. Taos is another of the large pueblos,\r\nand is especially interesting because it is still inhabited. This\r\ngreat building has from three to six stories with several hundred\r\nrooms. In the foreground of the photograph (Fig. 76) appears one of\r\nthe ovens in which the baking is done. In some of these pueblos\r\nthe women still grind their corn by hand in stone _matates_, just\r\nas their ancestors did for many hundreds and perhaps thousands\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--POTTERY OF THE ACOMA INDIANS, NEW MEXICO]\r\n\r\nIn northwestern New Mexico there is a remarkable flat-topped rock\r\nknown as the Enchanted Mesa, which rises with precipitous walls to\r\na height of four hundred feet above the valley in which it stands.\r\nIt was long believed that human beings had never been upon this rock,\r\nalthough there were traditions to the effect that a village once\r\nexisted upon its summit. According to the tradition, the breaking\r\naway of a great mass of rock left the summit inaccessible ever\r\nafterward. The cliffs were scaled recently by the aid of ropes,\r\nand evidences were found in the shape of pottery fragments, to\r\nshow that the Indians had once inhabited the mesa. Two or three\r\nmiles away, across the valley, is the large village of Acoma, where\r\na great deal of pottery is made for sale.\r\n\r\nThe pottery of the Pueblo Indians is very attractive, and their\r\nreligious festivals and peculiar dances draw many visitors. These\r\nIndians no longer fear attacks from the savage Apache or Navajo,\r\nbut they have become so used to their rock fortresses that it is\r\nnot likely they will soon. leave them. The Navajos now live in\r\npeace and raise large herds of sheep and goats; while the more\r\nsavage Apaches have been gathered upon reservations, never more\r\nto go upon the war-path. Most of the Apaches still live in their\r\nrude brush habitations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--NAVAJO WOMAN WEAVING A BLANKET]\r\n\r\nWhile the Pueblo Indians make attractive pottery, the Navajos are\r\nnoted for their blankets. The wool, which is taken from their herds,\r\nis dyed different colors, and woven upon their simple looms into\r\nthe most beautiful and costly blankets.\r\n\r\nWe usually think of the native inhabitants of America as leading a\r\nwild and rude life, moving from place to place in search of food,\r\nand constantly engaged in warfare with one another. The Pueblo\r\nIndians alone are different. Possibly if the white man had never\r\ncome to America these Indians might in time have become highly\r\ncivilized. But it is more than likely that in their struggle with\r\nNature in this wild and rugged country, where they were constantly\r\nsubjected to attacks from their more savage neighbors, they would\r\nhave sunk lower instead of rising, and would finally have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Apaches were dreaded alike by the agricultural Indians and the\r\nearly Spanish. Issuing from their mountain fastnesses the Apaches\r\nwould raid the unprotected villages and missions, and then retreat as\r\nquickly as they came. For many years after the American occupation\r\nprospectors had to be constantly on their guard, and many are the\r\ntragedies that have marked this remote corner of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nDuring the blinding glare of summer the deserts of southwestern\r\nArizona and the adjoining portions of California are forbidding\r\nin the extreme. Day after day the pitiless sun pours its heat upon\r\nthe vast stretches of barren mountain and plain, until the rocks\r\nare baked brown and it seems as if every particle of life must\r\nhave left the seared and motionless plants.\r\n\r\nMonth after month passes without rain. Now and then light clouds\r\nfloat into sight, and occasionally rain can be seen falling from\r\nthem, but they are so high that the drops all disappear in the dry\r\nand thirsty air long before they can reach the ground. Cloud-bursts\r\nmay take place about the peaks of some of the higher mountains, but\r\nthey have very little effect upon the life out on the plains.\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants brought to this region from a moister climate\r\nmust drink continually to make up for the rapid evaporation of\r\nmoisture from their bodies; a day without water may result in death.\r\nAnd yet the living things that have homes in the desert can resist\r\nthe dry air for many months without a renewal of their moisture.\r\nThere are areas where the average rainfall is less than three inches,\r\nand sometimes two years may pass without a drop of rain. It will\r\ncertainly be worth our while to find out something about these\r\ndesert plants and the way in which Nature enables them to get along\r\nwith so little water.\r\n\r\nGo where we will, from the moist heat of the tropics or the dry\r\nheat of the deserts to the icy north, we find that everywhere the\r\nplants and animals are suited to the climate of the particular\r\nplace in which they live. Therefore we might conclude that they\r\nthrive better in those places than they would anywhere else, but\r\nthat is not always true.\r\n\r\nA struggle is going on continually among plants for a footing in\r\nthe soil and for a share of the sunshine. The weaker plants are\r\ngenerally killed, while those hardy enough to survive have to adapt\r\nthemselves to new conditions of life, becoming stunted and deformed\r\nupon barren slopes; but they have plenty of room there because\r\nfewer plants are striving for the same place.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that the deserts of the southwest have always been\r\nas dry as they are now. As the amount of rainfall slowly lessened\r\nthrough thousands of years, the animals could migrate when it became\r\ntoo dry; but the plants, fixed in one place, had either to give up\r\nand die, or change their characters and habits to suit the demands\r\nof the changing climate. The fact that these extremely dry deserts\r\nare filled with plant life to-day is without doubt due to this\r\nability to change.\r\n\r\nIn a moist, warm climate plants are luxuriant; they take up a large\r\namount of water through their roots and evaporate it through the\r\nleaves. If placed in a desert, such plants would immediately wither\r\nand die. To avoid too rapid evaporation the bodies of the desert\r\nplants have become smaller, and their leaves have either shrunk\r\ngreatly or wholly disappeared. Strong-smelling, resinous juices\r\nexude from the remaining leaves and stems, and form a surface varnish\r\nthrough which water passes with difficulty.\r\n\r\nSome forms of plant life, such as the prickly-pear, are provided\r\nwith fleshy stems which hold a supply of moisture to be drawn upon\r\nduring the long dry season. Men and animals are sometimes saved from\r\ndeath by chewing the pulp of the prickly-pear or other cactuses.\r\nAfter a period of exceptional drought, the stems of the prickly-pear\r\nlose their bright green color and become shrunken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--PRICKLY-PEAR, BALL CACTUS, AND SPANISH\r\nBAYONET]\r\n\r\nThe development of the underground part of the plant is frequently\r\nout of all proportion to the part above the surface. The manzanita,\r\nwhich grows in the semi-arid climate of southern California, is\r\na low shrub with branches that are rarely large enough for fuel.\r\nThe roots, however, are large and massive, and are extensively\r\nused for firewood.\r\n\r\nThe desert plants are armed, not only against the dry air, but\r\nagainst the wandering animals which would bite them and suck their\r\njuices. The smell of the sagebrush is such that very few animals\r\nwill touch it. Other plants are protected by thorns. In fact, the\r\ndrier the region, the more thorny are its plants. A little shrub\r\ncalled the crucifixion thorn has no leaves at all, nothing but\r\nlong, sharp spines. Besides the straight thorns there are curved\r\nand also barbed ones, for every conceivable form is represented\r\namong the plants of these dry lands.\r\n\r\nAs the desert plants are armed against the animals, so the animals\r\nare armed against each other. Many of the insects and reptiles\r\nare extremely poisonous; the greater the heat of their habitat,\r\nthe more dangerous are their bites. The horned toad, while not\r\npoisonous, is protected by having horny spines upon its head and\r\nback. The little rattlesnake known as the \"side-winder\" is perhaps\r\nthe most dangerous of all, although the tarantula, centipede, and\r\nscorpion are formidable foes. The Gila monster, long believed to\r\nbe so dangerous, is now considered non-poisonous under ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--CRUCIFIXION THORN]\r\n\r\nThe desert tortoise is perhaps the most remarkable of all the animals\r\nof the desert. It is rare, and little is known of its habits except\r\nthat it lives in the most arid valleys of southeastern California,\r\nfar removed from any water. This tortoise has a diameter across\r\nits shell of at least eighteen inches. Its flesh is much prized\r\nby the Indians and prospectors. A specimen which had been without\r\nwater for an indefinite period was dissected, and the discovery\r\nwas made that upon each side there was a membranous sac, containing\r\nclear water, perhaps a pint in all. The desert tortoise, then,\r\ncarries his store of water with him, and is thus enabled to go many\r\nmonths without a new supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--THE GILA MONSTER]\r\n\r\nA trip across the deserts of the lower Colorado in spring, before\r\nthe bracing air of winter has entirely gone, is one never to be\r\nforgotten. The poisonous insects and reptiles are not at this time\r\nwarmed up to full activity, while many peculiar plants are just\r\ncoming into bloom.\r\n\r\nLet us study some of the strange forms growing thickly over the\r\nrocky slopes and sandy plains. There are miles of forest, but not\r\nsuch a forest as we are accustomed to see. Tall, fluted columns\r\nof the giant cactus (saguaro), with rows of sharp spines, reach\r\nupward to a height of from twenty to fifty feet. At one or more\r\nnodes, bud-like branches spring from the main trunk and, curving\r\nupward, form columns about the parent stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--THE PALO VERDE TREE AND SAGUARO]\r\n\r\nThe giant cactus bears near the top a purple flower and a large,\r\nedible fruit. This fruit, which has a red pulp, is a favorite food\r\nwith the Indians, and also with many insects and birds. It is gathered\r\nby means of long forked sticks, for if it should drop to the ground\r\nit would be broken. The pulp of the stalk yields a little juice\r\nor sap which is used by the Indians when hard pressed for water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--A FOREST ON THE PLAINS OF SOUTHERN ARIZONA\r\n\r\nShowing cholla and saguaro]\r\n\r\nScattered among the huge club-shaped columns of the saguaro is the\r\ncholla, the next largest of the cactuses. This species, which is\r\ntree-like in its branching and in rare cases grows to a height of\r\ntwelve feet, bears bright red or yellow flowers. One must approach\r\nwith care, for its jointed stems are so easily broken that at the\r\nslightest touch of the hand or clothing, pieces break off and adhere\r\nfirmly by means of their sharp curved and barbed spines. Another\r\nspecies of the cholla is small, reaching but a foot or two above\r\nthe ground, but this and other low forms so cover the ground in\r\nplaces that one has to be constantly on guard to keep from running\r\nthe spines into his feet.\r\n\r\nThese are not all the plants of this wonderful forest. The ocatilla\r\nis a cactus-like form having a group of long slender stems bunched\r\ntogether at the root. In the spring each is tipped with a spike of\r\nred flowers, and as the snake-like stalks wave in the breeze they\r\npresent an appearance scarcely less attractive than the saguaro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--OCATILLA]\r\n\r\nScattered among the vegetation just mentioned is the palo verde\r\n(green tree), so named from the yellowish green of its bark. It is\r\nremarkable for the small size of the leaves, which afford scarcely\r\nany shade for the traveller upon a hot summer day. (Fig. 84.)\r\n\r\nAlong the dry water courses we find the mesquite, a tree which does\r\nnot grow upon the gravelly plains and rocky slopes, for it needs\r\nmore moisture than most of the desert vegetation. In the spring\r\nit puts out delicate green leaves which form a pleasing contrast\r\nwith the other plants.\r\n\r\nRiding through one of these forests in the deepening twilight,\r\none is impressed with a feeling of awe and mystery by the strange,\r\nweird shapes outlined against the sky. In the cooler air of evening\r\nthe animals come from their retreats. The insects and the snakes are\r\nthen abroad, and if one is on foot the sudden buzz of a rattlesnake\r\nis not a pleasant sound to hear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--MESQUITE TREE, SANTA CRUZ VALLEY, SOUTHERN\r\nARIZONA]\r\n\r\nThe prickly-pear prefers slopes not quite so dry and hot as those\r\nof the forest just described. Its broad, spade-like, jointed stems\r\nare very interesting. The red fruit clustered upon their extremities\r\nis not disagreeable to the taste, but is covered with a soft, prickly\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the prickly-pear is a species of agave, but this\r\ndoes not grow so large in Arizona as it does farther south in Mexico.\r\nThe plant is familiar to us as the common century plant of our\r\ngardens. The long fleshy leaves with spines at the ends are clustered\r\nat the surface of the ground, and from their centre, at blooming\r\ntime, rises a tall flower stalk. The agave requires many years to\r\nmature. When the flower stalk has once started it grows rapidly,\r\nbut after blossoming the plant dies.\r\n\r\nThe mezcal, or pulque, the national drink of the Mexicans, is made\r\nfrom the sap of the agave. The fibre of the agave, known as sisal\r\nhemp, is used in the manufacture of rope, twine, mats, brushes,\r\netc. Other parts of the plant have various uses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--THE AGAVE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--SPANISH BAYONET IN BLOOM]\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of yucca in the more elevated portions of\r\nthe desert. They range in size from those only two or three feet\r\nhigh, of which the Spanish bayonet is a type, to the giant yucca of\r\nthe Mohave Desert, which attains the proportions of a tree and forms\r\nthick forests over an area of many miles. The Spanish bayonet, with\r\nits long stalk of white, waxy blossoms, presents a very beautiful\r\nappearance, as do also the young specimens of the tree yucca.\r\n\r\nAt rare intervals, once perhaps in many years, there is an unusual\r\namount of rainfall in the spring, and in a few weeks the desert\r\nbecomes transformed as if by magic. Seeds germinate, the presence\r\nof which one would never have suspected in the drier weather. In\r\nan incredibly short time the long gravelly or sandy slopes about\r\nthe bases of the mountains are covered with a veritable carpet of\r\ngreen, yellow, and red. The sand verbena, the evening primrose,\r\nbaby blue-eyes, and different kinds of lilies grow so thickly in\r\nplaces that every footstep crushes them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--YOUNG YUCCAS IN BLOOM]\r\n\r\nBut in a few short days the beauty has disappeared. The seeds mature\r\nspeedily and drop into the sand. A hot wind withers the stems and\r\nleaves and blows them away; drifting sands take the place of the\r\nrich carpet. How readily these plants have adapted themselves to\r\nthe brief period in which life is possible!\r\n\r\nThus it is that this vast region about the lower Colorado, although so\r\ndry and hot, and at first sight apparently so unfitted for sustaining\r\nlife, nevertheless supports its share. Many of the plant forms have\r\nassumed strange and monstrous shapes in their efforts to withstand\r\nthe hard conditions in the struggle for existence, while others simply\r\nlie in waiting, sleeping during the long dry year, but ready to\r\nspring into life when the favorable showers come, as they sometimes\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PONY EXPRESS\r\n\r\nAlthough it is only a little more than fifty years since the discovery\r\nof gold was made and the rapid settlement of the West began, what a\r\nchange has come over this great region! It was at first supposed to\r\nbe impossible to connect the growing settlements upon the Pacific\r\nwith the East by anything more than a wagon road, and those who\r\nadvocated the building of a railroad were ridiculed. Now the journey\r\nacross the continent is made upon smooth steel tracks in comfortable\r\ncoaches, for the skill of the engineer has overcome the difficulties\r\nof the desert, the mountain wall, and the canon.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers who pushed westward from the Mississippi River with\r\ntheir slow ox-teams took all summer to reach the fertile valleys\r\nof California and Oregon, and considered themselves fortunate if\r\nthey arrived at their destination before the coming of the winter\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nThe first overland stage line was established by way of New Mexico\r\nand Arizona, terminating at Los Angeles. Twenty-two days were required\r\nfor this part of the tiresome and dangerous trip. The route was\r\nlonger and more desert-like than that farther north across Nevada,\r\nbut the winter storms were avoided.\r\n\r\nThe stage-coach proved too slow for the needs of the growing settlements\r\nupon the Pacific slope. A telegraph line was planned, but it could\r\nnot be completed for some time, and even then it was probable that\r\nthe Indians would destroy the poles and wires.\r\n\r\nThen came the idea of a relay of fast messengers upon horseback,\r\nand the pony express was organized. It is difficult to believe\r\nthat by this means the journey of two thousand miles between St.\r\nJoseph, a point upon the Missouri a little above Kansas City, and\r\nSacramento, California, was once made in about eight days. This\r\nis only a little more than twice the time required by the fast\r\ntrains at present.\r\n\r\nFor two years the trip was regularly made in about nine days, averaging\r\ntwo hundred and twenty miles a day. It can be readily understood\r\nthat this wonderful feat required many relays of men and horses\r\nscattered along the route. The express rider had no well-graded\r\nroads to follow, but only the rough trail of the emigrants. This\r\nled across broad deserts and over rugged mountains, and throughout\r\nmost of the journey exposed the rider to the attacks of Indians.\r\n\r\nLet us take a map and trace the route of the express. It followed\r\nclosely the main overland trail which the gold-seekers had opened.\r\nNow towns and cities are scattered along the old trail, and the\r\nrailroad crosses and recrosses it. But let us try to picture the\r\ncountry as it appeared in its wild state.\r\n\r\nMountains, valleys and plains made up the landscape. Vast herds\r\nof buffalo darkened the Great Plains east of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nwhile farther west were numerous bands of antelope. The streams\r\nwere filled with beaver and other fur-bearing animals. Here and\r\nthere along the rivers were Indian villages with their curiously\r\nshaped tepees. Even the deserts of Nevada were not uninhabited,\r\nfor the Indians lived there also, gathered in little family groups\r\nabout the desolate springs.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the overland trail we do not mean a narrow path\r\nfor animals, but the wagon road, rude though it was, which the early\r\nemigrants had made. They were determined to cross the continent, no\r\nmatter what the difficulties and dangers. Wagons could be drawn\r\nby the oxen over the plains and deserts with little difficulty,\r\nalthough there were some dangerous rivers to be crossed. Mountains\r\nand canons offered the most serious obstructions. In many places\r\nthe wagons had to be let down over precipices with ropes, or be\r\ntaken apart and carried piece by piece around the obstructions.\r\n\r\nIt was not the mountains alone which made the trip \"across the\r\nplains\" one long to be remembered. It was often difficult to obtain\r\nwater and fodder for the animals, and at many points savage Indians,\r\nbent upon plunder, were in hiding, waiting for a chance to stampede\r\nthe cattle or kill the emigrants. The way was marked by abandoned\r\nwagons, household goods, bones of cattle, and the graves of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThe trail led from the Missouri across the state of Kansas to the\r\nPlatte River, then followed this long stream to its head at South\r\nPass on the continental divide. From the South Pass the trail led\r\nsouthwest past Fort Bridger, in southwestern Wyoming, through Echo\r\nCanon and over Emigrant pass of the Wasatch Range down to Salt Lake\r\nCity, which had been founded but a short time before the discovery\r\nof gold. West of Salt Lake City the trail skirted the northern\r\nshore of the Great Salt Lake, and after passing a low mountain\r\ndivide in what is now northwestern Utah, reached the head waters\r\nof the Humboldt River. Thence the path ran along by this river down\r\nto the place where it disappeared in a vast sandy desert known as\r\nthe sink of the Carson. The Carson River, after the dreary desert\r\nwas passed, led the emigrants still westward toward a wall of mighty\r\nmountains known as the Sierra Nevada. Here Nature seemed to have\r\ndone her utmost to shut off California, with its fertile valleys\r\nand rich gold-fields, from the longing eyes of the emigrants. There\r\nare, however, several low places in the range, and through one of\r\nthese openings, at the head of the Carson River, the travellers\r\ngained the western slope of the mountains. Then in good time they\r\nreached the mining town of Placerville, and at length Sacramento,\r\nthe capital of California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--CHIMNEY ROCK\r\n\r\nOn the old overland trail near the Platte River, western Nebraska]\r\n\r\nIn order that the pony express might make the time required over\r\nthe two thousand miles, five hundred horses and several hundred\r\nmen were needed. The stations were placed about ten miles apart\r\nand were strongly built so that they might withstand the attacks\r\nof the Indians. These stations, nearly two hundred in number, all\r\nhad to be supplied by means of freight teams, which often hauled\r\nhay, grain, and food for the messengers for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nThe horses selected for the messengers to ride were the small,\r\nsure-footed ponies called mustangs. Through a stretch of ten miles\r\nthe pony was pushed to its utmost speed, then it was carefully\r\ngroomed, fed, and rested until the time came to make the return\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the riders three things were of great importance:\r\nthey must be light in weight, must be possessed of great powers of\r\nendurance, and also must be brave and resolute. At each station,\r\nas the time approached for the express to arrive, the relay horse\r\nwas saddled and in waiting. As the rider dashed in he jumped from\r\nhis horse, and with but a moment's rest, threw the saddle-bags\r\ncontaining the letters upon the fresh horse and was off again,\r\nriding like the wind. Upon smooth stretches the horses often made\r\ntwenty miles an hour, but it was quite impossible to maintain this\r\nspeed over the rocky and rugged portions of the route. Storms and\r\nIndian ambuscades often delayed the riders. Sometimes the messenger\r\nkept up a running fight with the Indians for miles.\r\n\r\nThe riders were frequently killed, but the mail-bags were rarely\r\nlost. If a rider did not come in on time, it was known that something\r\nserious had happened, and search was immediately made. The riders\r\nwere not allowed to stop for any purpose whatsoever; neither storms\r\nof the greatest severity nor even the presence of hostile Indians\r\nnear the trail kept them from their duty. One of the few riders\r\nwho are still living says that he was never afraid except on dark,\r\ncloudy nights. At such times he made no attempt to guide his horse,\r\nbut trusting to the intelligence of the well-trained animal, gave\r\nit rein, and at the same time spurred it to its utmost speed. Think\r\nof riding at such speed into the dark night, not knowing what is\r\nahead of you! The rider's only safety lay in the carefulness and\r\nsagacity of the horse. Such a ride called for more courage than\r\ndid a conflict with Indians!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--PALISADES OF THE HUMBOLDT RIVER, NEVADA\r\n\r\nNear the overland trail]\r\n\r\nThe pony express carried no passengers. It carried no freight,\r\nnot even the usual express package. The messenger was intrusted\r\nwith nothing but two bundles of letters carefully stowed away in\r\na pair of saddle-bags.\r\n\r\nThe letters were not like our ordinary letters, for the paper used\r\nwas the thinnest and lightest possible. Hundreds of the letters\r\nweighed only a few pounds. It was very important that there should\r\nbe no great weight, for if the horses were heavily loaded, they\r\ncould not make the required time. Only those whose business was\r\nof great importance could afford to send letters by this express,\r\nfor the charge was five dollars upon each letter.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the high charge the pony express is said never to have\r\nbeen profitable, for the expenses were very heavy. It was discontinued\r\nin 1860, as by that time a telegraph line had been constructed\r\nacross the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CLIMATE AND PHYSICAL FEATURES INFLUENCED THE SETTLEMENT OF THE\r\nWEST\r\n\r\nThe story of the exploration and settlement of the Pacific coast,\r\nand of the great region lying between the Pacific slope and the\r\nMississippi Valley, offers a most interesting opportunity to study\r\nthe control which physical features of the earth exert upon the\r\ntrend of men's activities. The position of the mountains, the courses\r\nof the rivers, and the character of the sea-coast have all helped\r\nto shape the history of the West. The presence of gold in the rocks\r\nof the Sierra Nevada mountains was the chief incentive which led\r\nto the breaking down of the barriers placed by Nature between the\r\nPacific and the Mississippi basin.\r\n\r\nWhen an unknown land is accessible by water, the shore line offers\r\nthe easiest means for the first explorations and settlements. So\r\nit came about that nearly all the eastern coast of North America\r\nwas known before men ventured far into the interior. Then the large\r\nrivers, like the St. Lawrence, the Hudson, and the Mississippi,\r\nseemed to offer inviting routes into the recesses of the continent,\r\nbut exploration through the pathless woods and rough mountains\r\nwas slow.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that the Hudson was a short river and did\r\nnot lead across the continent as was at first hoped. Because of the\r\nabsence of other large rivers upon that portion of the coast which\r\nthe English occupied, their settlements did not spread westward as\r\nrapidly as they otherwise would have done. The country was covered\r\nwith dense forests, and savage Indians disputed the right to occupy\r\nit. In time, however, passes were found leading over the Appalachian\r\nMountains to the Ohio River and through the Mohawk Valley to the\r\nregion of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe advantages for travel offered by the St. Lawrence River and\r\nthe chain of lakes above it were utilized at an early day. The\r\nroute of the French missionary explorers and fur traders was from\r\nMontreal up the Ottawa River, then by a short portage and a series\r\nof small lakes to Lake Huron. From this point the most remote shores\r\nof Lakes Superior and Michigan could be easily reached. By the\r\naid of several small bodies of water west of Lake Superior, Lake\r\nWinnipeg and Great Slave Lake were finally discovered; but from\r\nthis point the waterways into the West were small and could be\r\nfollowed no farther, so that it was a long time before the Rocky\r\nMountains were crossed.\r\n\r\nBy floating down the Illinois River the French arrived at the\r\nMississippi, explored much of its course, and took possession of\r\nthe country in advance of the English. This fact was directly due\r\nto the difficulties which the English explorers experienced in\r\nforcing their way over the Appalachian highlands.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish explored the southern shores of the continent, and\r\ncrossing the Isthmus, were the first to behold the Pacific. The\r\nfact that the Pacific coast of North America was so easily reached\r\nat this point gave the Spanish a great advantage, and explains why\r\nthey gained such a hold upon the lands bordering that ocean. It\r\nwas a comparatively simple matter for them to fit out ships, and\r\nsailing north and south, to take possession wherever they desired.\r\nHowever, when they had gone as far as California, their progress\r\nwas for a long time almost completely blocked by storms and head\r\nwinds, for the prevailing direction of the wind is down the coast.\r\nThe Spanish finally reached Vancouver Island, but never succeeded\r\nin making settlements north of San Francisco. Even the interior of\r\nCalifornia was little known to them, for the mountains and deserts\r\ndiscouraged their progress in that direction.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of a map we might suppose that the Colorado\r\nRiver would offer as good a means for penetrating the continent as\r\ndid the Mississippi River, but as a matter of fact it is navigable\r\nfor a comparatively short distance. The Spanish made one attempt\r\nto ascend this river, but finding themselves surrounded on every\r\nhand by a most desolate, barren country, they turned back before\r\nreaching the Grand Canon. In the eager search for gold the Spaniards\r\npushed north from Mexico and planted settlements in Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico, but upon the northwest their progress was stopped by\r\ncanons and deserts.\r\n\r\nNow we are prepared to understand why it was that the western portion\r\nof North America remained for so long a time a mysterious and unknown\r\nregion. There were no waterways by which it could be explored,\r\nwhile snow-clad mountains and deserts made access to it doubly\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the last century the Americans had overcome the\r\nnatural obstacles in their westward progress, and their settlements\r\nreached as far into the wilderness as the Mississippi River. Hunters\r\nand traders were soon pushing far beyond, spreading over the Great\r\nPlains and up to the very base of the Rocky, or Stony Mountains, as\r\nthey were then called. The Missouri River became the great highway\r\ninto the Northwest, for the adventurers took advantage of the streams\r\nwherever possible. Many other rivers were discovered flowing from\r\nthe western mountains, but with the exception of the Platte and\r\nArkansas they were generally too shallow for navigation even with\r\na light canoe.\r\n\r\nStarting in the early spring from the mouth of the Missouri, the\r\nhardy trappers sailed and paddled up the river, taking several\r\nmonths to reach the head of navigation at the Great Falls. In the\r\nautumn, when the boats were loaded with furs, it was a comparatively\r\neasy matter to drop down the river with the current. It would have\r\nbeen almost impossible to transport the loads of goods on pack-horses\r\nacross the thousand miles of prairie, where the traders would be\r\nsubject to attack from hostile Indians.\r\n\r\nAdventurous men pushed farther and farther west through the passes\r\nin the mountains and began trapping upon the waters which flow into\r\nthe Pacific. It had long been supposed that the Rocky Mountains\r\nformed a barrier beyond which our country could not be extended,\r\nand that the Pacific slope was made up of mountains and deserts\r\nnot worth securing.\r\n\r\nThe explorers showed that the Rocky Mountains were not continuous,\r\nbut consisted of partly detached ranges, and that while their eastern\r\nfronts were indeed almost impassable for long distances, there\r\nwere places so low that it was difficult to locate the exact spot\r\nwhere the waters parted to seek the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of\r\nMexico. In southwestern Wyoming the continental divide, known as\r\nthe Great Divide mesa, though more than a mile above the sea, is\r\nbut a continuation of the long, gentle slope of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains decrease in height toward the south, near the\r\nline between New Mexico and Colorado. Here is situated Raton Pass,\r\nan ancient Indian highway from the valley of the Arkansas to the\r\nRio Grande. In the early half of the last century this trail was\r\nmuch used by the caravans of traders and came to be known as the\r\nSanta Fe trail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--ON THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE IN SOUTHWESTERN\r\nWYOMING]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the American occupation of California, the\r\nSanta Fe trail became an important route to the Pacific. From the\r\nMexican town of Santa Fe it led down the valley of the Rio Grande,\r\nfollowing the old road to Mexico, and then turned west across the\r\nbroad plateau of the continental divide, not far from the present\r\ncourse of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Passing Tucson, the road\r\nkept near the course of the Gila River to Fort Yuma, and then led\r\nover the Colorado Desert to Los Angeles. This path avoided all\r\nthe high mountains, but much of it lay across deserts, where the\r\nheat and scarcity of water made it an impracticable route for the\r\nemigrants.\r\n\r\nOne not acquainted with the physical geography of the West might\r\nwonder why the gold-seekers on their way to California did not make\r\nuse of the Missouri River, which, except for the Great Falls, was\r\nnavigable for small boats to the very base of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nA partial explanation is found in the report of the hardships endured\r\nby the Lewis and Clark exploring expedition, and later by the Astor\r\nparty, which went out to found a fur trading post at the mouth of\r\nthe Columbia. It had been supposed that after once crossing the\r\ncontinental divide it would be an easy matter to embark upon some\r\nstream and float down to the Pacific Ocean. The parties referred to\r\nbecame lost in the defiles of the mountains, and when they finally\r\nreached the Snake River it was only to find that rapids and waterfalls\r\ncontinually obstructed navigation. Although there was in most places\r\nplenty of water upon this northern route, yet the mountains were\r\nimpassable for wagons.\r\n\r\nBecause of these conditions the emigrants started out boldly across\r\nthe plains, following the general course of the Platte River, and\r\ncrossing the Rocky Mountain divide at the South Pass in western\r\nWyoming, a place famous in its day. At this point those who were\r\ngoing to Oregon turned northwestward to Fort Hall, a trading post\r\nof the Hudson Bay Company. From here they crossed southern Idaho,\r\nkeeping near the course of the Snake River until they reached the\r\npoint where it enters the grand canon; there they left the river,\r\nand climbing over the Blue Mountains, entered the fertile valleys\r\nabout the present city of Walla Walla. From this place the emigrants\r\nfollowed the Columbia River to The Dalles, whence they proceeded\r\neither by boat or raft until Fort Vancouver and the mouth of the\r\nWillamette were finally gained. Wagons were taken through on this\r\nroute, and it was not dangerous, although accidents sometimes happened\r\nat the Cascades, where locks were built at a later day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--THE OLD SANTA FE TRAIL\r\n\r\nOver this thousands of freight and emigrant wagons have passed]\r\n\r\nThe emigrants for California, who were the most numerous, turned\r\nsouthwest at South Pass, and after crossing the Wasatch Range through\r\nEmigration Canon, came out upon the plain of Great Salt Lake. Then,\r\ntraversing desert plains, they reached the Humboldt River, which\r\nthey followed until it sank into the sands.\r\n\r\nSeveral routes had been opened across the Sierra Nevada mountains\r\ninto California, but those through the Carson and Donner passes\r\nwere most used. Several high ranges of mountains lay between the\r\nWillamette Valley of Oregon and the Great Valley of California,\r\nso that in the early days there was very little travel between\r\nthese two territories. The overland trip required so long a time,\r\nand involved such dangers and hardships, that many preferred the\r\nwater route, in spite of the fact that its ships were crowded,\r\nand the voyagers must cross the fever-infected Isthmus.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note how widely different the rivers\r\nare upon the opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains. Those upon\r\nthe east, with the exception of the Missouri at the Great Falls,\r\nare not marked by waterfalls after leaving the mountains. There are\r\nfew canons of importance. The streams generally flow in channels\r\nonly slightly sunken below the general level of the Great Plains.\r\nThe streams upon the west, on the contrary, are broken by rapids\r\nand waterfalls, and are generally buried in canons so deep and\r\nprecipitous that in places a man might die of thirst in sight of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNo other great migration of people over the surface of the earth\r\never encountered such difficulties as that which pressed westward\r\nafter the discovery of gold. It was at first thought that railroads\r\ncould not be constructed through the mountains and deserts, and\r\nuntil the mineral wealth of the West became known, many men believed\r\nthat the greater portion of the country was not worth taking.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to consider each of the main lines of railroad\r\nwhich connect the Mississippi Valley with the Pacific, and study the\r\nfeatures of the country through which it runs, determining as far\r\nas possible the surveyor's reasons for selecting that particular\r\ncourse. Some of the railroads follow for long distances the routes\r\nof the emigrants. The emigrants, in their turn, often made use\r\nof the ancient Indian trails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--THE CARSON PASS, SUMMIT OF SIERRA NEVADA\r\nMOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nOne of the main emigrant routes to the Pacific Coast]\r\n\r\nWhile Nature seems to have striven to raise impassable barriers\r\nto shut off the Pacific slope from the rest of the continent, yet\r\nshe failed at some points, and through the unguarded passes the wild\r\nanimals and Indians first found their way. Then came the trappers,\r\nprospectors, farmers, and at last the railroad, until the wilderness\r\nwas over-run.\r\n\r\nBecause of its temperate climate, abundant rainfall, and rich soil,\r\nthe Mississippi Valley was rapidly settled after the pioneers had\r\nonce reached it. The plains rising slowly westward toward the base\r\nof the Rocky Mountains were found to be more arid the farther they\r\nwere explored. Consequently there exists a broad strip of plain\r\nwhich is even to-day sparsely settled. The emigrants went on to\r\nthe fertile valleys nearer the Pacific, where the rainfall is more\r\nabundant. The American settlers did not then understand irrigation,\r\nalthough it was practised by the Mexicans to the south. Because\r\nthe discovery of precious metals was first made in California,\r\nthe pioneers crossed the intervening mountains without giving a\r\nthought to the mineral riches which might be concealed in their\r\ndepths. Later, mines were opened in the mountains all through the\r\narid regions. The necessity of providing food for the miners brought\r\nabout the discovery that the desert lands were very productive\r\nwherever the waters of the streams could be brought to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE PROSPECTOR\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of us who have comfortable homes, sleep upon soft\r\nbeds, wear neat clothes, and can obtain every variety of food that\r\nwe wish, think with pity of the men who lead a rough and lonely life\r\namong the mountains far from all comforts. Let us learn something\r\nmore about the life and work of the prospectors, for we may find\r\nmuch that is desirable in their experiences.\r\n\r\nNot many thousands of years ago our ancestors led what we would\r\nnow call a wild and savage life. They had no permanent homes, but\r\nwandered here and there in search of food, and lived in caves or\r\nconstructed the rudest kind of shelter from the storms. Perhaps\r\nwe are right in feeling thankful that we were not born in those\r\nprimitive times, but are there not really many things to regret\r\nabout the way in which we have to live at the present day?\r\n\r\nThe utterly free outdoor life is not open to many. We have little\r\nor no opportunity to become acquainted with Nature, the guardian\r\nof our ancestors. The woods, the rocks, the mountains, and the\r\ndashing streams are almost complete strangers to many of us.\r\n\r\nMany men are now obliged to go every day to their work in office\r\nor shop, and spend the hours shut in from the fresh air and bright\r\nsunshine. At night they sleep in rooms into which they admit little\r\nfresh air for fear of taking cold. To-day each man has to learn\r\nto do one thing well to the exclusion of nearly everything else,\r\nin order to make a living. For this very reason we are in danger\r\nof becoming human machines and of losing the use of some of the\r\npowers with which Nature has endowed us. Many things about our\r\npresent mode of life are not natural to us, but through successive\r\ngenerations we have become somewhat adapted to them. The Indians,\r\nif taken from a life in the open air and made to live as we do,\r\noften sicken and die.\r\n\r\nThe farmer enjoys much more freedom and more of the sweet fresh\r\nair than do the artisans and office workers; but of all the men in\r\ncivilized countries the trappers and prospectors live most out of\r\ndoors. To be sure, they have to endure many hardships and dangers,\r\nand their beds are not always the softest nor their food the best,\r\nbut you will seldom find one who is willing to exchange his free\r\nlife for work in the town or city.\r\n\r\nThe trappers have nearly disappeared. Their occupation will be gone\r\nwith the passing of the wild animals which were once so abundant.\r\nThe prospectors are, however, becoming more numerous year by year\r\nthroughout the mountains of western America. To them we owe a great\r\ndebt, for had not their searching eyes brought to light the hidden\r\nmineral deposits this portion of our country would be far more\r\nthinly populated than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in California was accidental. A man named\r\nMarshall was building a mill for Sutter in the foot-hills of the\r\nSierra Nevada mountains at the time (1848) when California had\r\njust come into the possession of the United States. While at work\r\nhe noticed some shining grains in the sand of the mill-race. A\r\nlittle testing of the grains led him to the conclusion that they\r\nwere gold.\r\n\r\nThe news spread rapidly over the world, and since that time a constantly\r\nincreasing tide of gold-seekers has been pushing out into the unexplored\r\nportions of the earth. Comparatively few of these men have become\r\nwealthy, but their discoveries have led to the settlement of new\r\nregions and to the growth of important industries. In truth, if\r\nit were not for the deposits of valuable metals, large areas of\r\nthe desert and mountainous West would be of small value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--A PROSPECTOR IN THE DESERT]\r\n\r\nThe prospector needs little capital except health and strength, but\r\nhe must be willing to lead a rough life. He will be more likely to\r\nsucceed if he knows something about the different kinds of minerals\r\nand rocks, and is able to distinguish the valuable ones from those\r\nwhich are of little or no worth.\r\n\r\nThe prospector may have a pack-horse and a second horse to ride, or\r\nhe may go afoot with merely two burros to carry blankets, provisions,\r\nand tools. A burro costs little and will live upon almost anything.\r\nThe variety of food that can be carried is not large; such things\r\nas bacon, flour, sugar, beans, and coffee are the most important.\r\nWith the rifle one may frequently add to the supply. This, you may\r\nthink, is pretty hard fare, but life in the open air will make\r\none hungry enough to relish almost any sort of food.\r\n\r\nThe prospector does not need a road or even a trail. He seeks the\r\nleast-known portion of some mountain district where he has an idea\r\nthat gold may be found. Through the canons he goes, and over the\r\nmountains, either on horseback or driving the burros before him.\r\nWater and grass are usually abundant, and the little cavalcade\r\nstops where night overtakes it. In the desert prospecting is more\r\ndifficult and often dangerous, because of the scarcity of water.\r\nIt is necessary to know the location of the few scattered springs,\r\nand to make one of the burros useful in carrying water kegs. A\r\nspring must be the starting-point in the morning, and a sufficient\r\namount of water must be taken to last until the traveller can get\r\nback to the same spring or until he can reach another.\r\n\r\nA pick, a shovel, and a hammer are among the most important parts\r\nof the prospector's outfit. Gold is a heavy substance, and as it\r\nwashes down the mountain sides and into the gulches from some quartz\r\nvein, its weight finally takes it to the bed-rock beneath the sand\r\nand gravel. With his pick and shovel the prospector can reach the\r\nbed-rock. He takes some of the gravel from its hiding-place close\r\nto the rock, places it in a pan filled with water, and then, with\r\na peculiar rotary movement, washes away the lighter materials,\r\nleaving the heavier substances and the gold, if there is any, at\r\nthe bottom of the pan. If there is no trace of gold, the prospector\r\ngoes on to another creek; but if some of the yellow metal is washed\r\nout, he tests the place thoroughly for more.\r\n\r\nIn searching for ledges the prospector spends his time in the smaller\r\ngulches and upon the mountain sides. Every piece of detached quartz\r\nthat meets his eye is examined, and if any specks of gold appear,\r\nthe search is directed toward the vein or ledge from which the\r\nspecimen came. With the hammer, pieces of quartz are broken from\r\nthe veins which here and there rise above the surface of loose\r\nand crumbling rock. When the worker finds a piece that is stained\r\nwith iron and has the appearance of carrying gold, he places it in\r\nhis bag and keeps it for further examination. At camp, the pieces\r\nof quartz are pounded to a powder in a mortar and then washed in a\r\nhorn spoon. A string of fine grains of gold tells of the discovery\r\nof a rich vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--A PROSPECTOR'S CABIN IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nIt is not usually an easy matter to find home of a piece of stray\r\nquartz upon the mountain side. Days and weeks may pass while search\r\nis made up the slope, for the fragment must have come from some\r\npoint above. But the ledge, once discovered, is traced along the\r\nsurface for the purpose of determining its direction and extent.\r\n\r\nWhen a promising bed of gravel or a vein of gold-bearing quartz\r\nis found, the prospector posts the proper notices of his right\r\nto the claim and has them recorded at the nearest land office.\r\nThen he makes a permanent camp by cutting down trees and building\r\na cabin. The interior of the cabin is very simple. Its table and\r\nchairs are made of split lumber. One end of the single room is\r\noccupied by the bunk, and the other by a large fireplace. There\r\nmay be no windows, and the roof may be made of earth piled upon\r\nlogs, or of long split shingles commonly known as shakes.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after discovering a very rich quartz ledge, the prospector\r\ngoes back to a settlement to attempt to interest some one in buying\r\nor developing it. Sometimes it happens that he loses the location of\r\nthe vein and cannot go back to the place where it was discovered. In\r\nthis way his discovery becomes a \"lost mine,\" and grows in importance\r\nin people's minds as the story of its riches spreads from one to\r\nanother. Although men may spend years looking for such mines, they\r\nare not often found again.\r\n\r\nFrequently two men go prospecting together so that their work will\r\nbe less dangerous and lonely. If they are not at once successful,\r\nthey manage in some way to get supplies for a trip each year into\r\nthe mountains. Often they are \"grub-staked,\" that is, some man\r\nwho has money furnishes their supplies in return for a share in\r\ntheir findings.\r\n\r\nIf they have enough to eat, the prospectors, in their snug cabin,\r\nare comfortable and happy. The cabin is built as near as possible\r\nto the mine, so that the men need not be cut off from their work\r\nduring the stormy weather. The temperature underground is about the\r\nsame in both winter and summer, so that winter storms and summer\r\nheat form no hindrance to the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--MOUTH OF A TUNNEL]\r\n\r\nYears spent in life of this kind lead men to love the mountains.\r\nThey feel a sympathy with Nature and a companionship in her presence.\r\nWhen they have to visit the town for supplies, they long to get back\r\nto their little cabins. They feel lost in the whirl and confusion\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nSummer is a delightful time at the many little miners' cabins scattered\r\nthrough the mountains. The air is invigorating, the water pure and\r\ncold. There is everything in the surroundings to make one happy.\r\nIn the winter the miner sits by his great fireplace, with the flames\r\nroaring up the chimney. He has no stove to make the air close and\r\noppressive. About the fireplace his dishes are arranged--the kettle\r\nfor beans, the coffee-pot, and the Dutch oven in which the bread is\r\nbaked. If there are some old paper-covered story-books at hand, it\r\ndoes not matter how fiercely the storms rage without. Ask any old\r\nprospector who has spent years in this manner if he would exchange\r\nhis cabin for a house in the city, and he will most decidedly answer\r\n\"no.\"\r\n\r\nThis lonely life in the mountains seems to engender hospitality.\r\nThe old-time prospector will make you welcome to his cabin and\r\nwill share his last crust with you. When he asks you in to have\r\nsome coffee and beans, he does not do it merely for the sake of\r\nbeing polite, and he will feel hurt if you do not accept his\r\nhospitality. His dishes may not be as white as those to which you\r\nare accustomed, but I will venture to say that you have never tasted\r\nbetter beans than those with which he will fill your plate from\r\nhis soot-begrimed kettle.\r\n\r\nWe ought all to see more of this wildlife. Even if we do not care\r\nto, make our permanent homes among the mountains, it would do us\r\ngood to go there every summer at least, and so not only become\r\nstronger, but cultivate that familiarity with and love for outdoor\r\nlife which our ancestors enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD AND GOLD-MINING\r\n\r\nGold derives its value partly from its purchasing power, partly\r\nfrom those properties which make it serviceable in the arts, and\r\npartly from its beauty. The high esteem in which gold money is\r\nheld is as much the result of its comparative rarity as of its\r\nphysical properties. Among nearly all the nations of the world\r\nit has been agreed upon as a standard of exchange. Gold has one\r\ndisadvantage as a medium of exchange; it is rather too soft to wear\r\nwell. But this difficulty is overcome by alloying the gold with\r\nanother mineral of nearly the same color,--copper, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may understand better the position which gold\r\noccupies in the arts and trades of the world, let us compare it\r\nwith other metals, and first with platinum. This mineral is far\r\nless abundant and has many properties which make it valuable in\r\nthe arts. Like gold, platinum is malleable and ductile and does not\r\ntarnish in the air, but it differs from gold in not being easily\r\nfusible, so that it is used in the laboratory for crucibles. The\r\nsteel-gray color of platinum is, however, so much less attractive\r\nthan the yellow of gold, that it is not used for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made at one time by Russia, where a comparatively\r\nlarge amount of platinum is found, to coin this metal into money,\r\nbut its continued use was not found practicable because of its\r\nchanging price in the markets of the world. If the leading nations\r\nwould agree upon a fixed value for platinum, it might be used like\r\ngold as a medium of exchange.\r\n\r\nSilver is brighter and more attractive than platinum, but is of\r\nlittle use in the laboratory. It has been found in recent years\r\nto be so much more abundant than gold that its value has decreased\r\ngreatly as a commercial article. In our country when coined it\r\nhas, like paper money, been given a value equal to gold.\r\n\r\nThe diamond has a value far exceeding that of gold, but this value\r\nis dependent almost wholly upon its ornamental properties, although\r\nthe brilliant stone is also useful as an abrasive and cutting agent.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is evident that gold, because of its rarity,\r\nits physical properties, and its beauty, combines a larger number\r\nof desirable characteristics than any other mineral.\r\n\r\nGold can be found in very small quantities nearly everywhere. It\r\nis present in all the rocks and also in sea-water. The gold that\r\nis distributed in this manner is of no value to us, for it would\r\ncost many times as much to obtain it as it is worth. Nature has,\r\nhowever, concentrated it for us in some places. In portions of\r\nthe world where the crust has been folded and broken there are\r\nveins of quartz extending in long, narrow, and irregular sheets\r\nthrough the rocks. This quartz is the home of the gold, and it\r\nis usually found in hilly or mountainous regions.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake the yellow iron pyrites for gold. Pyrites is brittle,\r\nwhile gold is malleable. You can hammer a little grain of gold\r\ninto a thin sheet. Do not make the mistake, either, of thinking\r\nthat the shining yellow scales of mica which you see in the sand\r\nin the bottom of a clear stream are gold. These yellow minerals\r\nthat look like gold have been called \"fools' gold\" because people\r\nhave sometimes been utterly deceived by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--A GOLD-SILVER MINE\r\n\r\nSummit of San Juan Range, Colorado]\r\n\r\nUpon the Pacific slope minerals are now being deposited in some of\r\nthe openings of the rocks from which hot springs issue. A study of\r\nthese springs has led to the opinion that the gold-bearing quartz\r\nveins were formed in a similar manner, but at a very remote time\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\nThe milky or glassy quartz, which is so hard that you cannot scratch\r\nit with the point of your knife, the little grains of pale yellow\r\niron pyrites, and the grains and threads of gold scattered through\r\nthe quartz, were at one time in solution in water. This water came\r\nfrom some region far down in the earth, farther than we can ever\r\nreach with the deepest shafts, and there, where it is very hot and\r\nthe pressure is great, the water dissolved the little particles\r\nof gold and other minerals from the rocks; and then, gathering\r\nthem up, bore them along toward the surface, depositing them as\r\nsolid particles again in the form of veins in the fissures through\r\nwhich the stream was passing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--HYDRAULIC MINING ON THE KLAMATH RIVER,\r\nCALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nAs the rocks upon the surface decay and the crumbling material is\r\ncarried away by running water, the gold, being very heavy, washes\r\ndown the hillsides and is at last gathered in the gulches. This\r\nfact explains why we find gold both in veins and in the gravel of\r\nthe streams. Getting gold from the veins is called quartz-mining.\r\nWashing it from the gravel is called placer-mining; and if the\r\ngravel is deep and a powerful stream of water is required, the work\r\nis called hydraulic mining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--MAY ROCK, A VEIN OF QUARTZ ON THE MOTHER\r\nLODE]\r\n\r\nEveryone has heard of the Mother Lode of California. Every miner\r\nwishes that his mine were upon this famous lode, which is made\r\nup of a large number of quartz veins extending along the western\r\nslope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and is marked by hundreds\r\nof important mines. A line of towns marks the course of the Mother\r\nLode for over a hundred miles. They are almost entirely supported\r\nby the gold which the lode supplies.\r\n\r\nThe gold first discovered in California was placer gold. After\r\nthe miners had worked over the stream gravels and had secured all\r\nthat they could in that way, they began to search for the home of\r\nthe gold. It could not always have been in the creek beds, and\r\nthe miners were correct in thinking that it must have been washed\r\nfrom some other place. Gold was so frequently found in pieces of\r\nloose or float quartz that this fact finally turned their attention\r\nto the quartz veins which were numerous upon the mountain slopes.\r\nThen came the discovery of the series of great quartz veins now\r\nknown as the Mother Lode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--AN ARASTRA]\r\n\r\nWhen the miners first found the quartz flecked with gold, they\r\nused the simplest means for separating the two substances. If the\r\nquartz was very rich in gold, it was pounded and ground fine in\r\na hand mortar. Then the lighter quartz was washed away and the\r\ngold left.\r\n\r\nThe miners also made use of the Mexican arastra. This is a very\r\ncrude apparatus, and is employed even now by miners who cannot\r\nafford to procure a stamp-mill. To build an arastra, a circular\r\ndepression ten or twelve feet wide and a foot or more deep is made\r\nin the ground. This depression is lined with stone, which forms\r\na hard bottom or floor. Four bars extend outward from an upright\r\npost placed in the middle of the floor, and a large flat stone is\r\nfastened to the end of each bar by means of a rope. A horse is\r\nhitched to one of the bars, which is purposely left longer than the\r\nothers. The ore is thrown into the arastra, and water is admitted,\r\na little at a time. As the horse is driven around the stones are\r\ndragged over the circular depression, crushing the ore and setting\r\nfree the gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--THE STAMPS IN A QUARTZ-MILL]\r\n\r\nThis way of separating the gold was too slow, and in a short time\r\nthe stamp-mill was invented. It has grown from a very simple affair\r\ninto the great mill which crushes hundreds of tons of ore in a\r\nday. The iron stamps each weigh nearly half a ton. They are raised\r\nby powerful machinery and allowed to drop in succession upon the\r\nore, which is gradually fed under them. The stamps crush the ore\r\nto a fine sand more easily and rapidly than could be done by any\r\nother method. Water is kept running over the ore, and as fast as\r\nit is crushed sufficiently fine for the particles to pass through\r\na wire screen, the water with which they are mixed is allowed to\r\nflow over large plates of copper which have been coated with\r\nquicksilver. The latter mineral has an attraction for gold, and\r\nso catches and holds most of the particles, no matter how small\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nThe compound of gold and quicksilver is a soft white substance\r\nknown as amalgam, utterly unlike either metal. When the amalgam\r\nis subjected to heat, the quicksilver is driven off in the form\r\nof a vapor, and the gold is left pure. The quicksilver vapor is\r\ncondensed in a cool chamber and is used again.\r\n\r\nThe iron pyrites in the ore contains gold which cannot be separated\r\nby the crushing process and a machine called a concentrator has\r\nbeen invented to save this also. After passing over the copper\r\nplates the crushed rock and pyrites are washed upon a broad, flat\r\nsurface, which is moving in such a way that the lighter rock waste\r\nis carried away by the water. The pyrites now appears as a dark,\r\nheavy sand. This sand is placed in a roasting furnace, where the\r\nsulphur is driven off, and the gold and iron are left together.\r\nNow the gold is dissolved by means of chlorine gas, with which it\r\nunites in a compound called gold chloride. From this compound the\r\nmetallic gold is easily separated. All this may seem a complicated\r\nprocess, but it is carried through so cheaply that the ore which\r\ncontains only two or three dollars to the ton can be profitably\r\nworked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--MINING THE GRAVEL OF AN OLD RIVER-BED]\r\n\r\nNot all quartz veins carry gold. There are many in which not a single\r\nspeck of the precious metal can be found. Gold usually prefers the\r\nsociety of quartz to that of other substances, for minerals, like\r\npeople, seem to have their likes and dislikes. Along the Mother Lode,\r\nhowever, gold is sometimes found in little bunches and \"stringers\"\r\nscattered through slate. In such cases the slate is mined and sent\r\nto the mill.\r\n\r\nSome miners devote themselves to pocket mining. They trace the\r\nlittle seams in the rock, and where two seams cross they sometimes\r\nfind what they call a \"pocket.\" This is a mass of nearly pure gold\r\nof irregular shape, varying from a few dollars to thousands of\r\ndollars in value. This kind of mining is very uncertain in its\r\nresults, for a man may make hundreds of dollars in one day, and\r\nthen not find anything more for months.\r\n\r\nThe western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains was once covered\r\nwith the camps of thousands of placer miners. Piles of boulders and\r\ngravel are scattered along the creeks where the eager workers took\r\nout millions of dollars' worth of gold-dust and nuggets. Now many of\r\nthe streams and gulches are entirely deserted. But in other places,\r\nwhere the quartz veins outcrop, there are scores of stamp-mills at\r\nwork, night and day, pounding out the gold. Some of the mines have\r\nbeen sunk more than a half mile into the earth, and the gold is\r\nstill as abundant as ever.\r\n\r\nIn some portions of the mountains hydraulic mining is more common\r\nthan quartz-mining. Years ago many of the rivers occupied different\r\nchannels from their present ones. The gravels of these old channels\r\nin the Sierra Nevada mountains, and in other parts of the West\r\nwhere gold-bearing veins occur, are rich in gold. In these channels\r\nthe gold is so deeply buried that it cannot usually be obtained by\r\nmeans of pick and shovel. In order that the overlying gravel may\r\nbe removed as cheaply as possible, water is supplied by means of\r\nditches, often many miles long. From some near-by hill the stream\r\nis conducted down to the mine in strong iron pipes. It thus acquires\r\na great force, and when directed against a gravel bank rapidly\r\nwashes it away. Torrents of water bearing boulders, gravel, and\r\nsand, together with the particles of gold, are turned into sluice\r\nboxes lined at the bottom with quick-silver. This metal catches\r\nthe gold and forms an amalgam as it does in the quartz-mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER-MINING\r\n\r\nThere is a city hidden away in a narrow canon in the extreme southern\r\nportion of Arizona which is supported solely by a copper-mine.\r\nThe canon lies upon the southern slope of a range of mountains,\r\nand from its mouth one can look far off to the south across the\r\ndesert plains and mountains of Mexico. The city has an elevation\r\nof more than a mile above the sea, and the canon in which it is\r\nsituated is so narrow and steep-walled that you can almost jump\r\ndown from one street upon the roofs of the houses along the street\r\nbelow. Stairways, instead of walks, lead up the hillsides from\r\nthe main street in the bottom of the canon.\r\n\r\nYou might well wonder at the position of the city, and think that\r\nout of all the waste land in this region a better place might have\r\nbeen selected for its location. But cities grow where people gather,\r\nand people do not come to live in the desert unless there is important\r\nwork to be done there.\r\n\r\nA party of prospectors who were searching carefully over the mountains\r\nfound several mineral veins with green copper stains crossing this\r\ncanon and outcropping in the adjacent hills. Claims were staked out\r\nand recorded at the nearest land office. Then shafts and tunnels\r\nwere opened, and the miners became confident from the rich character\r\nof the ore that an important copper-mine might be developed.\r\n\r\nSupplies were brought across the desert with teams, and cabins\r\nwere built in the lonely canon. Then an enterprising man started\r\na store. As the mine was opened farther, its importance was better\r\nunderstood. There was a call for more miners and the town grew\r\nlarger. The houses clustered about the mine, the centre of all\r\nthe activities. At last a railroad was built, and the town became\r\na city, with narrow, winding streets occupying the winding canon,\r\nwhile tier upon tier of houses crept up the sides of the canon,\r\nwhich formerly had been covered only by growths of cactus and other\r\nplants of the desert.\r\n\r\nIf the mine should close, there would be no inducement to keep\r\npeople in the locality, and the city would become merely a group\r\nof deserted buildings. Water is so scarce that only a small amount\r\nis allowed to each family, and it is delivered in barrels instead\r\nof by pipes. Provisions of all kinds are very expensive, for they\r\nhave to be brought a long distance.\r\n\r\nThe great mine supports the thousands of inhabitants. The varied\r\nindustries represented there are dependent upon it alone. As long\r\nas it pays to mine the copper, the people are as contented as if\r\nthey were not tucked away in a canon in a remote corner of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting things to be seen about the city are the mine\r\nand the smelter. In the former the ore is obtained; in the latter\r\nthe ore goes through various processes until it comes out in the\r\nform of shining, metallic copper. The copper ore, we must understand,\r\nis not metallic or \"native copper,\" as it is called when found pure,\r\nbut a combination of copper with other substances which change\r\nits appearance entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--COPPER SMELTER AND CITY OF BISBEE, ARIZONA\r\n\r\nThe pipe leading up the hill carries away sulphur fumes from the\r\nsmelter]\r\n\r\nThe mine is opened by a shaft, that is, a square hole sunk in the\r\nground. The shaft of this mine is a thousand feet deep, and is\r\nbeing continually extended downward. If we wish to go down into\r\nthe mine, we must put on some old clothes and get the foreman to\r\nact as guide. The cage in which we are to descend stands at the\r\nmouth of the shaft, suspended by a steel rope. It looks much like\r\nthe elevators found in city buildings. At different levels horizontal\r\npassages, called drifts, extend to the right and left upon the\r\nvein of copper ore. We step out of the car at one of these levels\r\nand with lighted candles start to walk through a portion of the\r\nmine. There are so many miles of tunnels that it would take us\r\ndays to go through them all.\r\n\r\nOverhead, under our feet, and upon the sides of the drift, lies the\r\nvein of copper are, presenting a different appearance at different\r\nplaces. The various ores sparkle in the light and we gather specimens\r\nof each. The common are is chalcopyrite, a copper sulphide; that\r\nis, it is composed of copper and sulphur. It has a brass-yellow\r\ncolor, but is often stained with beautiful iridescent tints. In\r\nplaces the chalcopyrite has been changed to the delicate green\r\ncarbonate of copper called malachite. In other places it has given\r\nplace to the oxide of copper. The little crimson crystals of this\r\nmineral give bright metallic reflections.\r\n\r\nThe deposit of copper ore is apparently inexhaustible, for in places\r\nthe vein widens so that chambers one hundred feet wide and several\r\nhundred feet long and high have been made in taking it out.\r\n\r\nIn going through the mine we have to be very careful not to step\r\ninto openings in the floor of the passages, or drop rock fragments\r\ninto them, for far below miners may be working. The places where the\r\nmen are taking out the ore are called \"stopes,\" and to reach them\r\nwe have to crawl and creep through all sorts of winding passages,\r\nnow through a \"manhole,\" and now down a long ladder which descends\r\ninto black depths.\r\n\r\nFrom the stopes the ore, as it is blasted out, is shovelled into\r\nchutes running down to some drift where there are men with cars.\r\nEach car holds about a ton of ore, and after being filled it is\r\npushed along the drift and upon a cage which raises it to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--HOMES OF MINERS, BISBEE, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\nThe mine is not wet, for there is so little rain in this region\r\nthat there are few underground streams. In places, however, it is\r\nwarm, for when the oxygen of the air reaches the fresh sulphide\r\nit begins to oxidize the ore; that is, it begins to burn it, and\r\nchange it into a different compound, just as fire changes wood\r\nor coal. Wherever oxidation is going on, heat is produced.\r\n\r\nFresh air is constantly needed in these workings far underground.\r\nA supply is forced down in pipes, and then allowed to flow back\r\nto the surface. In this way a thorough circulation is kept up.\r\n\r\nUnderground one loses all thought of the changes between night and\r\nday, for it is always dark there. Consequently we are surprised\r\non coming up from the mine to find that night has settled over\r\nthe town. Lights are twinkling everywhere, and miners with their\r\npails of luncheon are coming for the night shift.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting experience now awaits us in the form of a visit\r\nto the smelter. Here the bright copper is extracted from the\r\nrough-looking ores. How different the two substances appear! They\r\nlook as if they had scarcely anything in common.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the smelter seems like a bit of the infernal regions\r\nset upon the earth. While watching what goes on, we might imagine\r\nthat we were far down in the earth, where Vulcan, the fire god, was\r\nat work. At night the scene is particularly weird and impressive,\r\nfor the shadows and general indistinctness make everything appear\r\nstrange. The glowing furnaces, the showers of sparks, the roar\r\nof the blast furnaces, the suffocating fumes of sulphur, and the\r\nhalf-naked figures of the Mexican workmen, passing to and fro with\r\ncloths over their mouths, form all together a bewildering scene.\r\n\r\nThe ore is first pulverized, and then placed in large revolving\r\ncylinders, where it is roasted. A fire is started in the cylinder\r\nat first, but after the ore becomes so much heated that the sulphur\r\nin it begins to burn, no further artificial aid is necessary. Little\r\nby little the ore is added in quantities sufficient to keep the\r\nfire going. The object of the roasting is to drive off as much\r\nsulphur as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter being raked from the roasting furnace, the ore is wheeled\r\nin barrows to the huge upright furnaces and is thrown in. Here\r\nsuch materials as limestone and iron are also added to aid in the\r\nformation of a perfectly fused or molten mass. These substances\r\nare known as fluxes. With the melting of the ore the copper begins\r\nto separate from the impurities.\r\n\r\nThe melted ore, in the form of a glowing liquid, gathers at the\r\nbottom of the furnace and runs out into a large kettle-like receptacle.\r\nWhen ore of these vessels is full it is tipped up and the molten\r\ncopper which has collected at the bottom, because it is heavier than\r\nthe slag, is allowed to run into another large kettle, supported\r\nby chains from a rolling truck above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--SHIPPING COPPER MATTE]\r\n\r\nThe slag is dumped into a car and is carried outside, while the huge\r\ndish containing the copper and some slag is swung to the opposite\r\nside of the building, where its contents are cast into another\r\nfurnace. A very strong blast of air is forced up through the molten\r\nmass in this furnace, and the remaining portion of slag is blown\r\nout at the top in a shower of glowing particles.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of the furnace the liquid copper is drawn out and\r\nallowed to run into moulds where it finally cools. It is then known\r\nas copper matte. The copper still contains some impurities, and\r\nretains in addition whatever gold and silver may have been present\r\nin the ore. Most copper ores carry a small amount of these precious\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nThe heavy bars of copper matte are now ready for shipment to some\r\nmanufacturing point, where they are refined still further and made\r\ninto the various copper utensils, copper wire, etc. Copper is valuable\r\nfor many purposes, as it does not rust easily, is highly malleable\r\nand ductile, and is a good conductor of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the great copper-mines upon Lake Superior, copper is found in the\r\nnative state mixed with the rock, and does not have to be smelted;\r\nbut in most mines the ore must go through a process very like the\r\none described before metallic copper can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter how remote a region may be, how intense the\r\nheat or cold, or how desert-like the surrounding country, men will\r\ngo to it if minerals of value are discovered; and there they will\r\nperhaps spend the whole of their lives, mining these substances\r\nwhich are of such importance to the industries of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM\r\n\r\nPeople are beginning to ask where fuel will be obtained when the\r\ncoal-beds are exhausted and the petroleum is all pumped out of the\r\nearth. The cold winters will not cease to come regularly, and we\r\nshall continue to need fires for many purposes. This is a question\r\nwhich need not trouble us. So long as the sun lasts in the sky\r\nand the oceans cover so much of the earth, and so long as there\r\nare mountains upon the land, there must be streams with rapids\r\nand waterfalls. The power of these streams, which has for ages\r\ngone to waste, is now being turned into electricity for purposes\r\nof light and heat. We may be sure that long before the mines cease\r\nto produce coal and the wells to supply petroleum, there will be\r\nsomething better ready to take their places.\r\n\r\nBut coal and petroleum are still such important commodities that\r\neveryone should know something about the way in which they were\r\nmade. This earth of ours has had a very long history, much of which\r\nhas been recorded in the rocks beneath our feet, and the record\r\nis more accurate than are many human histories which have been\r\npreserved in the printed books.\r\n\r\nThe story of the earth has been divided into different periods,\r\neach marked by the predominance of certain kinds of living things.\r\nThe Carboniferous period has been so named because at that time\r\nthe climate and features of the earth in many places favored the\r\ngrowth of dense and heavy vegetation. This vegetation accumulated\r\nthrough the long years, so that it formed thick deposits which\r\ngradually changed to beds of coal. It would be wrong, however, to\r\nthink that all the beds of coal were formed at about the same time.\r\nEver since there have been forests and marshes upon the earth there\r\nhave been opportunities for the forming of coal-beds. Materials\r\nare accumulating even now which will in time be transformed to\r\nbeds of coal.\r\n\r\nWe must be equally careful to gain correct ideas of the making\r\nof petroleum, for many wrong notions are current. While coal has\r\ncome from the accumulation of plant remains, petroleum has been\r\nderived from sea organisms, chiefly animals. If coal and petroleum\r\nare found near each other, the occurrence is accidental and does\r\nnot mean that the two substances are in any way related.\r\n\r\nOur earth is very old, and its surface has gone through many\r\ntransformations; mountains, plains, and portions of the sea floor\r\nhave changed places with one another. Wherever there have been\r\nmarshy lowlands, since plants first began to grow luxuriantly upon\r\nthe earth, it has been possible for beds of coal to be formed.\r\nWe all know how rankly plants grow where there is plenty of heat\r\nand moisture. Many of us have been in swampy forests and have seen\r\nthe masses of rotting tree trunks, limbs, and leaves. Now, if we\r\nshould form a picture in our minds of such a swamp slowly sinking\r\nuntil the water of some lake or ocean had flowed over it and killed\r\nthe plants, and then washed sand and clay upon the buried forest\r\nuntil it was covered deeply in the earth, we should understand\r\nhow the coal-beds began. Veins of coal that have been opened by\r\nthe miners frequently show trunks and stumps of trees, as well\r\nas impressions of leaves and ferns. Underneath the coal there is\r\nusually a bed of clay, while above sand or sandstone is commonly\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe oldest coal has been changed the most. It is hard and rather\r\ndifficult to ignite, but when once on fire it gives more heat and\r\nburns longer than other coals. This coal, known as anthracite, is\r\nnot found extensively in the United States outside of Pennsylvania.\r\nCoal which is younger and has been less changed by the heat and\r\npressure brought to bear upon it when it was buried deep in the\r\nearth, is known as bituminous. This is the kind of coal which is\r\nfound in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, in the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand upon the Pacific slope. A still younger coal, which is soft\r\nand has a brownish color, is called lignite, and is found mostly\r\nin the South and West.\r\n\r\nStill another sort of fuel, known as peat, is found in swamps where\r\nconsiderable vegetation is now accumulating, or has accumulated\r\nin recent times. Peat is a mass of plant stems, roots, and moss,\r\npartly decayed and pressed together. In countries where wood is\r\nscarce peat is cut out, dried, and used for fuel.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the coal in the eastern United States was formed\r\nduring the Carboniferous period. That part of our country was then\r\nlow and swampy; but the West, which is now an elevated area of\r\nmountains and plateaus, was at that time largely beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\nThen, as the surface of the earth continued to change, the ocean\r\nretreated from the Rocky Mountain region, and extensive marshy\r\nlowlands with lakes of fresh or brackish water came into existence.\r\nThere were such marshes in the areas that are now covered by New\r\nMexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Dakota, and Montana. Westward for some\r\ndistance the land was higher, but in the states of Washington,\r\nOregon, and California there were other marshy lowlands covered\r\nwith heavy vegetation.\r\n\r\nWe know from what we have seen of the manner in which wood decays,\r\nthat in the dry, open air it does not accumulate, but is in great\r\npart carried away by the wind. It is only in swamps and shallow\r\nbodies of water that the decaying wood can gather in beds. From\r\nthese facts we have a right to draw conclusions as to the former\r\nnature of the surface where there are no coal-beds. There are extensive\r\nbeds of limestone in the western United States which are of the\r\nsame age as the coal-beds in the east. As such beds of limestone\r\ncould have formed only in the ocean, their presence throws a good\r\ndeal of light upon the geography of those distant times.\r\n\r\nUpon the Pacific slope the marshes were not so extensive, nor did\r\nthey last for so long a period, as those in the East. Nature seems\r\nto have confined her strongest efforts at coal-making to the country\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains. Perhaps she thought that the people\r\nof the West would not need coal if she gave them plenty of gold\r\nand silver.\r\n\r\nIn the Appalachian mountains Nature folded the strata and left\r\nthem in such a position that the coal could be mined easily. In\r\nthe Mississippi Valley the beds were left flat, almost in their\r\noriginal position, so that shafts had to be sunk to reach the coal.\r\nUpon the Pacific slope Nature seems to have had a large amount\r\nof trouble in arranging things satisfactorily. She has made and\r\nremade the mountains so many times, and folded and broken the crust\r\nof the earth so severely where the swamps stood, that now large\r\nportions of the coal beds which once existed have crumbled and\r\nbeen washed away by the streams. The scanty supply of coal which\r\nnow remains is in most places hard to find and difficult to mine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--SEAMS OF COAL ENCLOSED IN SANDSTONE,\r\nCALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nThe best coal mined near the Pacific comes from Vancouver Island.\r\nLarge beds of a younger and poorer coal are found southeast of\r\nPuget Sound. There are other beds in the Coast ranges of western\r\nOregon, and a few small ones in the Coast ranges of California.\r\nThe great interior region between the Rocky Mountains and the Coast\r\nranges has very little coal. The people of California have to import\r\nlarge quantities of coal. Some is brought by the railroads from the\r\nRocky Mountain region, but the most comes by ships from various\r\nparts of the world, from England, Australia, or British Columbia.\r\nThe ships bring the coal at low rates and take away grain and lumber.\r\n\r\nCoal is almost the only important mineral which Nature has bestowed\r\nsparingly upon the Pacific slope. In California, however, she has made\r\namends by storing up large quantities of petroleum. In Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio there is petroleum as well as coal. Oil has also been\r\ndiscovered in the Rocky Mountain region and in Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--A SPRING OF WATER AND PETROLEUM\r\n\r\nThe black streak is petroleum]\r\n\r\nPetroleum is found flowing from the rocks in the form of springs,\r\neither by itself or associated with gases and strong-smelling mineral\r\nwater. The oil is usually obtained by boring wells, but in southern\r\nCalifornia there is one mountain range which furnishes large quantities\r\nthrough tunnels which have been run into its side. Petroleum is\r\ncommonly found in porous sandstones or shales, from one or two\r\nhundred to three thousand feet below the surface. It was not made\r\nin these rocks, but has soaked into them just as water soaks into\r\na brick. The rocks which produced the oil or petroleum are dark,\r\nstrong-smelling shales or limestone. Heat a piece of such rock,\r\nand you will drive out a little oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--OIL WELLS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES,\r\nCALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nPool of oil in foreground]\r\n\r\nExamine a piece of the shale from one of the oil districts of\r\nCalifornia, and you will discover that it is a very peculiar rock,\r\nfor it is made up almost wholly of minute organisms which once\r\ninhabited the ocean. Among the forms which you will find are the\r\nsilicious skeletons of diatoms, the calcareous skeletons of\r\nforaminifera, scales of fish, and, rarely, the whole skeleton of\r\na fish.\r\n\r\nWhere now there are mountains and valleys dotted with oil derricks,\r\nthere was once the water of the open ocean. This water was filled, as\r\nthe water of the ocean is to-day, with an infinite number of living\r\nthings. As these creatures died, their bodies sank to the bottom, and\r\nwhile the soft parts dissolved, the hard parts or skeletons remained.\r\nThrough perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, the skeletons continued\r\nto accumulate until beds were formed hundreds or even thousands\r\nof feet in thickness. The materials of the beds, at first a soft\r\nmass like the ooze which the dredger brings up from the bottom\r\nof the present ocean, became packed together in a solid mass.\r\n\r\nThen disturbances affected this old sea bottom. It was raised, and\r\ngravel, clay, and sand from some new shore were washed over the\r\nbed of animal remains, burying it deeply. Continued movements of\r\nthe earth finally folded these rocks, which, as they were, squeezed\r\nand broken, became warm. The heat and pressure started chemical\r\naction in the decayed animal bodies, and particles of organic matter\r\nwere driven off in the form of oil and gas. These substances were\r\nforced here and there through the fissures in the rocks. Part of\r\nthe products found a way to the surface and formed springs, while\r\nother portions collected to form vast reservoirs in such porous\r\nrocks as sandstone. The sulphur and mineral springs which occur\r\nin oil regions tell us that this work of oil-making is still going\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe oil as it comes from the ground is usually brownish or greenish\r\nin color, and much thicker than the refined product which we use\r\nin our lamps. Some of the crude petroleum is thick and tar-like\r\nin appearance, and when long exposed to the air turns to a solid\r\nblack mass called \"asphaltum.\" This, when softened by heat and\r\nmixed with sand, makes a valuable material for street pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMATE OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nThe western portion of the United States exhibits very interesting\r\nclimatic features. In California, for example, there may be found\r\nevery degree of temperature between tropic heat and arctic cold.\r\nIn the deserts of the southeastern portion of the state the air\r\nis extremely dry, while in the northwest it rains nearly every\r\nmonth in the year.\r\n\r\nUpon the borders of Puget Sound the thermometer seldom falls below\r\nthe freezing-point, while southern Newfoundland, in the same latitude,\r\nis marked by cold and snowy weather for at least six months of\r\nevery year. Southern California has the same latitude as central\r\nGeorgia, but its average temperature near the coast is but little\r\nhigher than that of Puget Sound, while it is warmer in winter and\r\ncooler in summer than Georgia. The deserts of southern California\r\nand Arizona are so hot that for four months of the year work in the\r\nsun is almost impossible; yet the higher portions of the Sierra Nevada\r\nmountains, but a short distance away, have an arctic climate. The\r\nwhole Pacific coast region has, with the exception of the mountains,\r\na much milder climate than one would expect from a mere knowledge\r\nof its latitude. It will be instructive to search out the reasons\r\nfor the remarkable contrasts in climate presented by different\r\nportions of the slope.\r\n\r\nThe imaginary lines passing through points of equal temperature\r\nupon the earth are called \"isotherms.\" These lines rarely accord\r\nin direction with the parallels of latitude, but curve far to the\r\nnorth or south. The irregular course of the isotherms is due to\r\nmany causes. Among these are the distribution of the land and water,\r\nthe direction of the prevailing wind, the position of the mountain\r\nranges, and the elevation above sea-level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEATHER MAPS\r\n\r\nFair weather over central portion of Pacific slope. Storm coming\r\nin upon coast of Washington\r\n\r\nStormy weather over the western half of the United States]\r\n\r\nIn winter the isotherms curve far to the north over the North Pacific\r\nand North Atlantic oceans; but over the intervening land they curve\r\nas much to the south. In summer the isotherms are almost reversed\r\nin position, at least as far as the land is concerned, for they\r\nbend to the north in the heart of the continent. There are important\r\nreasons for the slight variation of the isothermal lines upon the\r\nwestern borders of North America and Europe, and their great change\r\nof position in the interior from winter to summer, but these reasons\r\nare not at all difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of large bodies of water changes but little throughout\r\nthe year, for water warms and cools slowly. The surface of the\r\nland, on the contrary, heats rapidly, and then as quickly loses\r\nits heat with the changing season. The air over the ocean is cooler\r\nin summer and warmer in winter because of the influence of the\r\nwater, but over the land, in districts far from a large body of\r\nwater, the changes in temperature between day and night, summer\r\nand winter, are very great.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly thought that the warm Japan current, which flows\r\nagainst the western shore of North America, was responsible for\r\nthe exceptionally mild climate there, and that the Gulf Stream\r\nproduced a similar climate upon the coast of western Europe. More\r\ncareful study, however, has shown that not the warm ocean currents,\r\nbut rather the winds blowing from the water, are the cause of the mild\r\nclimate in those lands across which they blow. In temperate latitudes\r\nthere is a slow movement of the air in an easterly direction, and\r\nin consequence the climate of the western coast of North America\r\nis not marked by such extremes in winter and summer as are the\r\ninterior and the eastern sections. It is also surprising to find\r\nhow nearly alike the average winter and summer temperature is at San\r\nFrancisco. It is also surprising to note that the average temperature\r\nof Seattle differs so little from that of San Diego, although these\r\ntwo places are separated by sixteen degrees of latitude.\r\n\r\nIn some places the climatic conditions which we should naturally\r\nexpect seem to be reversed. Oranges are grown in the Great Valley\r\nof California as far north as Red Bluff, and actually ripen a month\r\nsooner than they do near Los Angeles, five hundred miles farther\r\nsouth. The early ripening of fruits in the Great Valley may be\r\nexplained by the presence of the inclosing mountain ranges: the\r\nSierra Nevada mountains upon the northeast shut off the cold winds\r\nof winter, while the Coast ranges upon the west break the cool\r\nsummer winds which come from off the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting fact connected with the climate of the West is\r\nthe influence exerted by the direction of the mountain ranges. As\r\nthese ranges usually lie across the path of the prevailing winds,\r\ntheir tempering influence is lost much more quickly than it otherwise\r\nwould be. West of the Coast ranges the summers are cool and the\r\nwinters are warm. Upon the eastern side of these mountains the\r\nwinters are somewhat cooler and the summers very much warmer. In\r\nthe dry, clear air of the desert valleys, far from the ocean, the\r\ndaily range in temperature is sometimes as great as fifty degrees,\r\nwhile the winters are cool and the summers unbearably hot.\r\n\r\nWe all know how much cooler a hill-top is than a valley upon a\r\nsummer day. Where the mountains rise abruptly to a great height, as,\r\nfor example, does the San Bernardino Range of southern California,\r\none can stand among stunted plants of an arctic climate and look\r\ndown upon orange orchards where frost rarely forms. Mount Tamalpais,\r\na peak of the Coast Range north of San Francisco, has an elevation\r\nof nearly three thousand feet. The summer temperature upon this\r\nmountain forms an exception to the general rule, for while the\r\nlowlands are buried in chilling fog, the air upon the summit is\r\nwarm and pleasant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--ORANGE ORCHARDS CLOSE UNDER SNOW-CAPPED\r\nPEAKS\r\n\r\nHighlands, California]\r\n\r\nThe north and south mountain ranges not only make the interior\r\nhotter than it would otherwise be, but rob it of much of the moisture\r\nwhich it should receive. The winter storms coming in from the ocean\r\nfind the cool mountains lying across their path and quickly part\r\nwith a large proportion of their moisture. Where the coast mountains\r\nare low, as is the case with a great part of California and of\r\nOregon, more of the moisture passes on to the next line of mountains,\r\nthe Sierra Nevada-Cascade Range, the western slope of which is\r\nwell watered. In the region of the Columbia the Cascade Range is\r\nalso low, and the storms, which often follow one another in quick\r\nsuccession, sweep across the Columbia plateau and over the Rocky\r\nMountains. Farther south, not only are the storms fewer in number,\r\nbut the mountains are very much higher, so that the desert basins\r\nof the lower Colorado and Death Valley region are extremely dry.\r\nOne can in imagination stand upon the summit of the Sierra Nevada\r\nmountains, and upon the one hand look down upon barren valleys of\r\nvast extent, broken by mountains almost as barren, where nothing\r\ncan be grown except by means of irrigation; and upon the other\r\nside, toward the coast, see a country plentifully visited by rain,\r\nand either covered with forests or given over to farming and\r\nfruit-raising.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains form the eastern barrier which the storms encounter.\r\nTheir summits are very high and are covered with deep snow during\r\nthe winter. East of these mountains lie the Great Plains, where the\r\nprecipitation is light until we go far enough toward the Mississippi\r\nValley to reach the influence of the moist air currents from the\r\nGulf of Mexico. Many storms originate over the region of the Gulf\r\nof California, particularly in the late summer, and supplement to\r\nsome extent the light winter storms of Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe storms of which we have been speaking are known as cyclones.\r\nThis term does not refer to the local storms which occur in the\r\nMississippi Valley and are frequently so destructive, but to great\r\ndisturbances of the air. Sometimes the column of whirling air is\r\nmore than a thousand miles in diameter. The air in a cyclone is\r\ncircling and at the same time rising, so that the motion is spiral.\r\nIf you will study an eddy in a stream of water, you will get an\r\nidea of the nature of the motion, except that in the case of the\r\nwater eddy the movement is downward. The motion of the particles\r\nin the dust-whirls which all have seen moving across the fields\r\nnear noon on warm summer days illustrate the movement of the air\r\nin one of these great storms. The direction of the air in a cyclone\r\nis opposite to that of the hands of a clock.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind comes up from a southerly point, when high, thin\r\nclouds, gradually growing thicken, spread over the sky, and the\r\nbarometer begins to fall, then it is known that a storm is corning.\r\nIf one will learn to watch the clouds and the winds carefully he\r\nmay become able to predict a storm with almost as much certainty\r\nas if he had a barometer. This instrument registers the pressure of\r\nthe air, which is always less within the area of a storm, because\r\nthen the air is rising. So when the barometer falls we may always\r\nknow that a storm is approaching.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the storms which occur in the central and\r\nnorthern United States come in from the Pacific Ocean in the latitude\r\nof Washington. Continuing east or southeast they reach the Mississippi\r\nValley, and then turn northeastward toward the St. Lawrence Valley.\r\nIn the summer months there are few storms, and they very rarely\r\nreach as far south as California. As winter approaches the storms\r\nbecome more frequent and severe, and move farther and farther south\r\nuntil the whole land as far as Mexico receives a wetting.\r\n\r\nUpon the Pacific coast there is often very little warning of the\r\ncoming of a storm, but in the Middle and Eastern States they may\r\nfrequently be predicted several days in advance. With the passing\r\nof one of these storms the temperature falls rapidly, and this\r\nlowering of temperature, together with the fierce wind, gives rise\r\nupon the Great Plains to \"blizzards\" or \"northers.\" These storms\r\nendanger the lives of both men and animals.\r\n\r\nAt different times in the year, particularly in winter, spring,\r\nand early summer, warm, dry winds occur. Those winds which sweep\r\ndown from the heights of the Rocky Mountains and quickly melt the\r\nsnows are known as \"chinooks.\" The hot north and east winds of\r\nCalifornia often do great damage to growing crops.\r\n\r\nNow let us sum up briefly the factors which have together produced\r\nthe climatic features of the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\n(1) Ordinarily the factor of the greatest importance is latitude.\r\nWe should expect that Seattle would have a much colder climate than\r\nSan Diego because it receives the sun's rays more slantingly.\r\n\r\n(2) The influence of latitude is greatly modified by the temperate\r\nwinds blowing from the Pacific, so that places far separated in\r\nlatitude differ but little in average temperature, their summers\r\nbeing cooler and their winters warmer than we should expect them\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n(3) The storms pass over the land with the general easterly movement\r\nof the air. The largest number pass east across the northern portion\r\nof the United States. The farther south we go the fewer are the\r\nstorms and the less the rainfall. Along the coast of Washington\r\nthe annual rainfall is nearly one hundred inches. At San Diego\r\nit is only about ten inches.\r\n\r\n(4) The position of the mountain ranges causes the influence of\r\nthe ocean on the air to be lost within a short distance toward\r\nthe interior of the continent, so that the extremes of temperature\r\nrapidly become greater. The position of the mountains also affects\r\nthe rainfall of the interior. Since a large proportion of the moisture\r\nis condensed upon their ocean slopes, the climate of each succeeding\r\nrange toward the interior becomes more dry and desert-like. While\r\nin some of the lowlands thus cut off from the ocean the climate is\r\nextremely arid, yet the country is relieved from utter barrenness\r\nthrough the presence of mountain peaks and ranges, which often\r\ncondense considerable moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--SCENE IN FORESTS OF WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nShowing spruce and cedar]\r\n\r\n(5) The higher a region is above the sea, the colder the climate.\r\nThe summit of a high mountain and the valley at its base may be\r\nin the same latitude, and yet one may possess an arctic climate\r\nwhile the other has a sub-tropical one.\r\n\r\nThe heavy rainfall in western Washington, Oregon, and northern\r\nCalifornia results in dense forests. To the south, the rainfall\r\nupon the lowlands is not sufficient to produce forests, but as\r\nit is greater upon the mountains, trees thrive upon their sides.\r\nThe elevation at which trees will grow becomes higher and higher\r\nas we go into the more desert regions, until in northern Arizona\r\nit is found to be above six thousand feet. The high plateaus are\r\ngenerally treeless, but are covered with such shrubs as greasewood\r\nand sage-brush.\r\n\r\nWe see now that our climate is the product of many factors. It\r\nfrequently varies greatly in places only a few miles distant from\r\neach other. Consequently there may be a great variety of productions\r\nand industries in one small area, while in other regions the climate\r\nand productions are almost unchanged for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT IRRIGATION\r\n\r\nTravellers from the Eastern States who visit New Mexico for the\r\nfirst time are attracted by many unusual sights. There are the\r\ninteresting little donkeys, the low adobe houses of the native\r\nMexicans, and the water ditches winding through the gardens and\r\nfields, which are divided into squares by low ridges of earth.\r\n\r\nIf the fields are seen in the winter time, when dry and barren,\r\nthe meaning of their checkered appearance is not at first clear,\r\nbut in the spring and summer one is not long in finding out all\r\nabout them. When the time comes to sow the seed, water is turned\r\ninto these squares from the ditches which traverse the valleys,\r\nand one square at a time is filled until the ground in each is\r\nthoroughly soaked. Afterward, when the ground has dried enough\r\nto be easily worked, the crop is put in. The seeds soon sprout\r\nunder the influence of the warm sun, and the land becomes green\r\nwith growing plants. The same method of moistening the ground is\r\nused for the orchards and vineyards.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of all this work? Why not wait for the rains to\r\ncome and wet the earth, as the farmer does in the eastern United\r\nStates? The Mexicans, who have tilled these valleys for more than\r\ntwo hundred years, ought certainly to have learned in all that\r\ntime how to get the best returns. You may be sure that they would\r\nnot water the ground in this way if it were not necessary. The fact\r\nis that over a large portion of the western half of the United\r\nStates it does not rain enough to enable the farmer to grow his\r\ncrops. The climate is generally very different from that of the\r\nMiddle and Eastern States.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mexicans moved northward into the valley of the Rio Grande\r\nRiver, into Arizona and California, they found a climate similar in\r\nmany respects to that at home, and soon learned that it was necessary\r\nto water the land artificially in order to make it productive. Though\r\nin many places sufficient rain fell, yet the heaviest rainfall\r\ncame in the late summer or winter, when the plants needed it less,\r\nwhile the spring and summer were long and dry. The Mexicans were\r\nnot the first to practise watering the land, if we may judge from\r\nthe ruins of ancient ditches constructed by the primitive Indian\r\ninhabitants. It is evident that they too made use of water in this\r\nmanner for the growing of their corn and squashes.\r\n\r\nThis turning of water upon the land to make it productive is termed\r\n\"irrigation.\" The work is performed in different ways, as we shall\r\nsee later. Irrigation is now carried on through all portions of\r\nthe United States where the rainfall is light and streams of water\r\nare available.\r\n\r\nTo one who has lived in a country where there is plenty of rain,\r\nit seems to involve a great deal of work to prepare the land and\r\nto conduct water to it. One may feel pity for the farmer who has\r\nto support himself in this manner in so barren a country. I am\r\nsure, however, that if any such person will stop to think, he will\r\nremember times when in his own fertile home the expected rain did\r\nnot come, and the vegetation wilted and dried up. He may have become\r\ndiscouraged because of a number of \"dry years,\" but probably never\r\nthought that he had the means at hand to make up, at least in part,\r\nfor the shortcomings of Nature, in sending too much rain one year,\r\nand another year too little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--WATER-WHEEL FOR LIFTING WATER FOR IRRIGATION,\r\nVIRGIN RIVER, SOUTHERN UTAH]\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless have paid such a farmer many fold to have been\r\nprepared at the coming of a dry year to turn the water from a\r\nneighboring stream over his lands. This process would have involved\r\na good deal of labor; but how the plants would have rejoiced, and\r\nhow abundantly they would have repaid him for the extra trouble!\r\n\r\nThe showers come without regard to the time when growing things\r\nneed them most, but with irrigation the crops are independent of\r\nthe weather. The farmer may be sure that, if he prepares the ground\r\nproperly and sows the seed, the returns will be all that he can\r\nwish. In many localities several crops may be raised in a year\r\nby this method where otherwise only one would grow.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how the water is taken from the streams and what\r\nare the different methods employed to distribute it over the land.\r\nAlmost every valley is traversed by a stream, great or small. It\r\nmay be a river, with a large volume of water, or a creek which\r\ncompletely dries up during the long, rainless summers of the West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--GARDEN IRRIGATION, LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO]\r\n\r\nIn rare cases the stream may flow upon a built-up channel which\r\nis as high as the valley, but usually it is sunken below the level\r\nof the floor of the valley, and enclosed by banks of greater or\r\nless height. How is the water to be sent over the land? Where the\r\ncurrent is swift you may sometimes see a slowly turning water-wheel,\r\nhaving at the ends of the spokes little cups, which dip up the\r\nwater as the wheel revolves and pour it into a flume that runs\r\nback over the land. At some places engines are used to pump the\r\nwater from the stream and lift it to the desired height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--IRRIGATING AN ALFALFA FIELD, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, another method is employed: the water is taken\r\nout of the stream in an artificial channel dug in the earth. But\r\nin order to get the water at a sufficient height to make it flow\r\nover the fields, it is necessary to start a ditch or canal at a\r\nfavorable point some distance up the stream, perhaps miles from\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nThe ditch is made with a slope just sufficient for the water to\r\nflow. The slope must be less than that of the river from which the\r\nwater is taken, so as to carry the stream, at last, high enough\r\nto cover the lands to be irrigated.\r\n\r\nVisit almost any valley in the West where agriculture or fruit-growing\r\nis being carried on, and you will at once notice the lines of the\r\nditches, apparently level, as they wind around the hillsides. At\r\nconvenient distances there are gates to let out the water for the\r\norchards and fields.\r\n\r\nThe ground may be moistened in different ways. The first method is\r\nthat employed by the Mexicans, who, if we except the Cliff Dwellers,\r\nwere the first to introduce irrigation into our country. This consists\r\nin dividing the land into squares by embankments and allowing the\r\nwater to flood each in succession. The method is known as irrigation\r\nby checks, and can be used conveniently only upon nearly level\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn many orchards a series of shallow furrows is ploughed between\r\nthe rows of trees, and the water is allowed to flow down these\r\nuntil the soil is thoroughly soaked. In alfalfa fields the water\r\nis often turned upon the upper end and permitted to work its way\r\nacross until it reaches the lower edge, soaking the ground as it\r\ngoes. The slopes must in every case be so gentle that the current\r\nwill not be strong enough to carry away the soil.\r\n\r\nOnce in every two to four weeks throughout the spring and summer,\r\nthe exact period depending upon the rapidity with which the ground\r\ndries, the wetting is repeated. If the soil is light the water\r\nmust be turned on more often and a larger supply is required.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the stream from which the water is taken\r\nso nearly dries up in the summer, when the water is most needed,\r\nthat the cultivated lands suffer severely. During the winter little\r\nif any irrigation is necessary, but at that time the streams are\r\nso full that they frequently run over their banks and do great\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nHow to preserve the water thus going to waste and have it at hand\r\nfor summer use has been an important problem in regions where every\r\nparticle of water is valuable. Study of the question has led to\r\nthe examination of the streams with reference to the building of\r\nreservoirs to hold back the flood waters. A reservoir may be formed\r\nof a natural lake in the mountains in which the stream rises, by\r\nplacing a dam across its outlet and so making it hold more water.\r\nIf this cannot be done, a narrow place in the canon of the stream\r\nis selected, above which there is a broad valley. At such a place\r\nthe dam which is built across the canon is held firmly in place\r\nby the walls of rock upon each side, and an artificial lake or\r\nreservoir is made. Ditches lead away from this reservoir, and by\r\nmeans of gates the water is supplied when and where it is needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--SWEETWATER RESERVOIR, NEAR SAN DIEGO,\r\nCALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nThe streams which furnish the water for irrigation in the arid\r\nregion rise in mountains with steep rocky slopes, and until the\r\nwater issues from these mountains it is confined to canons with\r\nbottoms of solid rock, so that no water is lost except by evaporation.\r\n\r\nAfter the streams emerge from the canons upon the long, gentle\r\nslopes of gravel and soil which lie all about the bases of the\r\nmountains, they begin immediately to sink into the porous material.\r\nThey frequently disappear entirely before they have flowed many\r\nmiles. Some of this water can be brought to the surface again by\r\ndigging wells and constructing pumping plants, but the greater\r\npart is lost to the thirsty land.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the water from sinking into the gravel, ditches lined\r\nwith cement are often made to carry it from the canons to the points\r\nwhere it is needed. Sometimes iron pipes or wooden flumes are used\r\nin place of the ditches.\r\n\r\nWhat a transformation irrigation makes in the dry and desert-like\r\nvalleys of the West! Land which under Nature's treatment supports\r\nonly a scanty growth of sagebrush or greasewood, and over which\r\na few half-starved cattle have roamed, becomes, when irrigated,\r\ncovered with green fields and neat homes, while sleek, well-fed\r\nherds graze upon the rich alfalfa. Ten acres of irrigated land\r\nwill in many places support a family, where without irrigation a\r\nsquare mile would not have sufficed.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that the soil of these naturally barren valleys\r\nwas poor, but such is not the case. The ground did not lack plant\r\nfood, but merely the water to make this food available. With plenty\r\nof water the most luxuriant vegetation is produced. The soil is,\r\nindeed, frequently richer than in well-watered regions, for a lavish\r\nsupply of water carries away a portion of the plant food.\r\n\r\nIn some places, where the land is almost level and the soil is\r\nfilled with large quantities of soluble materials, such as soda\r\nand salt, keeping the ground moist through irrigation brings these\r\nsubstances to the surface in such quantities as to injure and sometimes\r\nkill the vegetation. In order that such lands may be successfully\r\ncultivated, the salts have to be either neutralized or washed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--IRRIGATING DITCH, NEAR PHOENIX, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\nMany of the rivers of the West carry large quantities of silt in\r\nsuspension, which fills the ditches and causes a great deal of\r\ntrouble; but when the silt is deposited over the surface it adds\r\ncontinually to the richness of the land.\r\n\r\nThe full development of irrigation will mean a great increase in\r\nthe population and wealth of all the Western States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCATION OF THE CITIES OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\nThis old earth has to be consulted upon every occasion. It is a\r\nsilent partner in all our undertakings. We sometimes think that\r\nwe come and go as we please, but a little thought convinces us\r\nthat we are not really so free.\r\n\r\nThe traveller must take account of the slopes of the land. It is\r\nmuch easier for him to follow a valley and cross a mountain range\r\nthrough a low spot, although his course be very crooked, than it is\r\nto make a \"bee line\" for his destination. The farmer, in choosing\r\nhis home and the kind of produce which he will raise, has to consult\r\nthe soil and climate. He cannot expect to grow grain where the\r\nsoil is poor and dry, or grow apples where the late spring frosts\r\nkill the buds. The miner knows that he cannot expect to find gold\r\nveins in the valleys, where the rocks are deeply covered by the\r\nsoil, and so he turns his steps toward the mountains, where Nature\r\nhas made his work easy by lifting up the rocks and exposing them\r\nto his view.\r\n\r\nRoutes of commerce and trade are governed by geographic, and to a\r\ncertain extent by climatic, conditions. Shallow streams with rapids\r\nand waterfalls obstruct navigation. The absence of harbors along a\r\ngiven coast makes it difficult for ships to take and discharge\r\ncargoes. Railroads cannot be constructed unless long and expensive\r\nsurveys have first been made to determine the route which Nature\r\nhas made the easiest between two given points.\r\n\r\nThe character of the climate and geographic features of a given\r\ncountry determine whether it shall become noted for agricultural\r\nproductions, mining industries, manufactures, or commerce. The\r\nlocations of the cities and towns and the roads connecting them\r\ndepend upon geographic conditions. There is not an occupation of\r\nany importance in which people engage at any particular place that\r\nis not dependent in large degree for its success upon the conditions\r\nwhich Nature has imposed upon that place.\r\n\r\nA city will not grow up at a given point unless the geographic\r\nconditions are favorable. There must be some natural reason to\r\ninduce people to gather in large numbers in one place. At one spot\r\nthere are facilities for manufacturing, such as water-power and coal,\r\nand easy means of communication with other parts of the world. At\r\nanother, the only reason for the growth of a city is the existence\r\nof rich mines. A third place may be conveniently located in the\r\nmidst of a rich agricultural region, where it is easy to bring\r\nin supplies and ship out the products of the soil.\r\n\r\nA study of the founding and growth of some of the cities of the\r\nWest, and particularly of the Pacific slope, will bring out many\r\ninteresting facts.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is the metropolis of the Pacific; its population\r\nwill soon reach half a million. If we look back seventy-five years\r\nwe find San Francisco an unimportant Mexican military post and\r\nthe seat of one of the smaller missions. Monterey, the capital\r\nof the province of California and one of the two leading towns\r\n(Los Angeles being the other), apparently had all the advantages\r\nin the race for supremacy.\r\n\r\nIn date of discovery (1603) Monterey Bay has the advantage of more\r\nthan one hundred and fifty years over San Francisco Bay. It is\r\ndifficult to understand why the different navigators who sailed\r\nnorth along the coast failed to discover California's most magnificent\r\nbay. Sir Francis Drake went by it, evidently not seeing the narrow\r\nopening between the headlands now known as the Golden Gate. Vizcaino,\r\nafter discovering Monterey Bay, also passed by and anchored where\r\nDrake had stopped, in a little bay now called Drake's Bay, a few\r\nmiles north of San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\nAfter the founding of San Diego, in 1769, a party started overland\r\nfor Monterey, but by reason of the peculiar position of the bay\r\nthey passed it unknowingly, and by accident came upon the body of\r\nwater which has since been of so great importance to the commercial\r\nlife of California. Monterey Bay in time lost its importance, partly\r\nbecause it was not thoroughly protected from the storms, and partly\r\nfrom the lack of easy communication with the rest of the state.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the acquisition of California and the discovery\r\nof gold, the advantages of San Francisco Bay began to be appreciated,\r\nand the little Mexican town grew rapidly. The narrow entrance to the\r\nbay, which had for so long a time delayed its discovery, completely\r\nprotected it from the storms, while its long arms opened across\r\nthe coast mountains directly into the important valleys of the\r\ninterior. Ocean vessels could go up the bay and through the Strait\r\nof Carquinez, while river boats could be used for many miles farther.\r\nAfter the discovery of gold, ships from all parts of the world\r\nfound ample room and shelter in San Francisco Bay; and the incoming\r\nminers, going by the water routes to Marysville, Sacramento, and\r\nStockton, easily reached the gold-bearing gravels of the Sierra\r\nNevada streams.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of southern California and a portion of the\r\nnorthern coast, almost all the agricultural and mineral resources\r\nof California are directly tributary to San Francisco. This place\r\nis naturally the centre of home trade, of foreign commerce, and\r\nof population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--SAN FRANCISCO BAY\r\n\r\nFormed by the sinking of the land and flooding of a river valley]\r\n\r\nNature failed to supply San Francisco with one essential advantage,\r\nnamely, cheap power for manufacturing. There is no water-power\r\nnear and but little coal in the state. Since the coal has to be\r\nshipped in from distant points, its high price has impeded\r\nmanufacturing. But now it appears that San Francisco is not so\r\nbadly off after all, for important deposits of petroleum have been\r\ndiscovered in the central and southern portions of California;\r\nand besides, processes have been invented for transforming the\r\nunlimited water-power of the mountain streams into electric energy,\r\nand transmitting this power to all the cities about the bay.\r\n\r\nThe early Spaniards founded the pueblo of Los Angeles in its present\r\nlocation, because at this point the Los Angeles River carried an\r\nabundance of pure water which could be led out in ditches to irrigate\r\nthe fertile bottom lands in the vicinity. Partly because it became\r\na railroad centre, and partly because it is surrounded by rich\r\nvalleys, Los Angeles has grown with great rapidity and now stands\r\nnext to San Francisco in size among California cities.\r\n\r\nSan Diego, which has a harbor next in importance to that of San\r\nFrancisco, has grown more slowly, because of the greater difficulty\r\nin developing water systems for irrigation, and because access\r\nis not so easy on account of the enclosing mountains. However,\r\nit must in time become the second commercial city of the state.\r\n\r\nMountain barriers make travel from one portion of California to\r\nanother somewhat difficult. Mountains separate San Francisco and the\r\nGreat Valley of California from all other portions of the continent.\r\nNature seems to have planned here a little empire all by itself. But\r\nengineering skill in the construction of railroads has overcome the\r\nbarrier upon the north which separates California from Oregon. The\r\nSierra Nevada range upon the east has been crossed at Donner Pass,\r\nand upon the south an outlet has been found through the Tehachapi\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nIn the state of Oregon, the city of Portland ranks first in importance.\r\nWhy did not Astoria or Fort Vancouver develop into the metropolis\r\nof the Columbia basin?\r\n\r\nAstoria, which was founded in the early part of the last century, has\r\na spacious and well-protected harbor, but it has no large tributary\r\nagricultural valleys. Moreover, the greater number of deep-water\r\nships pass it by, and go as far up the Columbia as possible to\r\ntake on their loads of grain.\r\n\r\nFort Vancouver, on the site of the old Hudson Bay trading post, is\r\npractically at the head of deep-water navigation upon the Columbia,\r\nbut there seems to be no particular reason why trade should centre\r\nhere, and this town also has been left behind in the march of progress.\r\n\r\nThe earliest settlements in western Oregon were made upon the Willamette\r\nRiver, which drains a large and extremely fertile valley. Near the\r\npoint at which this river joins the Columbia, the city of Portland\r\nsprang up. This town occupies an ideal position. It is accessible\r\nfor deep sea vessels, and has communication by river boats with\r\nthe Willamette Valley and the upper Columbia River.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, when sailors were looking for a passage\r\nacross the northern portion of the continent, an opening was found\r\nextending into the land between Vancouver Island and Cape Flattery.\r\nIt was at first thought that this was the desired waterway, but\r\nvarious navigators, among them Vancouver, explored the body of\r\nwater into which the Strait of Fuca opened, only to find that every\r\nbranch and inlet terminated in the land. Puget Sound is nearly\r\nenclosed by water and is so large as really to form an inland sea.\r\nIts long arms reach out in three directions among the most heavily\r\ntimbered valleys and mountain slopes of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe cities of Puget Sound had a later start than most of the other\r\ncities of the Pacific coast, for this portion of the old Oregon\r\nterritory was for a long time claimed by the English, and during\r\nthat period was peopled only by Indians and trappers. In 1846 the\r\npresent boundary was established, and Puget Sound passed into the\r\npossession of the United States.\r\n\r\nBecause of the dense forests, agriculture could not play an important\r\npart in the development of the sound region for some time. Lumbering\r\nwas naturally the leading occupation. This industry could be carried\r\non all the more advantageously because of the innumerable inlets\r\npenetrating the land.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of Puget Sound for foreign commerce began to be\r\nevident, but the Cascade Range stood in the way of railroads from\r\nthe eastward. Although it was a comparatively easy task to build\r\na railroad north from Portland, yet the sound region did not begin\r\nto grow rapidly until, after careful surveys, two railroads finally\r\nfound passes through the Cascade Range so as to reach tide-water.\r\nAs in other places, when the necessity for overcoming them arose,\r\nthe obstacles which Nature had interposed were found not to be\r\nso troublesome as was at first supposed. Now the once formidable\r\nrange has been tunnelled and will no longer form a serious barrier\r\nbetween the interior portion of Washington and the coast.\r\n\r\nTacoma, Seattle, and Everett have grown up on the sound as important\r\ncommercial and manufacturing cities, and will, on account of their\r\nfavorable situation, receive their share of the commerce of the\r\nPacific. The cities of the sound are particularly well situated\r\nfor intercourse and commerce with Alaska and northeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThese cities are also well situated for manufacturing, because\r\ncoal and wood are plentiful and consequently cheap, but they have\r\nnot in their immediate vicinity so extensive agricultural valleys\r\nas the Willamette and the Great Valley of California. The lumberman\r\nmust be supplanted by the farmer and fruit-grower before the slopes\r\nabout Puget Sound can be fully developed.\r\n\r\nThe natural outlet for the great wheat-fields of central Washington\r\nis by way of the Columbia River to the ocean, but the tunnelling\r\nof the Cascades partly diverts their products to the sound region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--FALLS OF SPOKANE RIVER\r\n\r\nLocation of the city of Spokane]\r\n\r\nThe city of Spokane, in eastern Washington, clearly illustrates\r\nthe control which physical features exert upon the settlements\r\nand industries of men. The Spokane River, soon after issuing from\r\nCoeur d'Alene Lake, flows out over the volcanic plains of Washington.\r\nIn the course of a few miles it descends into a shallow canon by\r\na series of cascades and waterfalls. The water-power furnished by\r\nthese falls has determined the position and growth of Spokane.\r\nThe falls brought sawmills and manufacturing plants, and these in\r\nturn brought people and railroads. The city has become a great\r\ncommercial centre for all the region round about. The extensive and\r\nrich mineral district upon the north, extending even into British\r\nColumbia, finds its most convenient source of supplies at Spokane.\r\nEast of the city is the Coeur d'Alene mining region, while south\r\nand west are large areas devoted to the cultivation of fruit and\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA\r\n\r\nSupported entirely by mining]\r\n\r\nThe city of Great Falls, Montana, in the Missouri River basin,\r\nis destined to become a great industrial centre, because of the\r\npresence of unlimited water-power afforded by the Great Falls of\r\nthe Missouri River. No other reason would lead to the growth of\r\na settlement at this particular spot, for boundless plains extend\r\nabout it in every direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--BUTTE, MONTANA\r\n\r\nA city of smelters]\r\n\r\nThe mining cities of the West, such as Butte, Virginia City, and\r\nLeadville, illustrate the growth of important centres of population\r\nin the vicinity of large deposits of minerals. In the case of these\r\ncities, as well as many others, there are no agricultural resources\r\nin the surrounding country to support the people gathered together\r\nhere. Nearly all their food has to be shipped hundreds of miles.\r\nCities supported by mining are less likely to be permanent than\r\nthose supported by an agricultural community, by commerce, or by\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST BELT OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nNo other coniferous forests in the world can compare with those\r\ncovering the western slope of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges.\r\nThey are remarkable both for the number of species and for the\r\nsize of the trees. The moderate temperature and the moist winds\r\nfrom the Pacific seem to offer the conditions which are best suited\r\nto the growth of cone-bearing trees.\r\n\r\nAs we go northward along the coast, or ascend the mountain slopes,\r\nwe find the climate growing cooler and cooler. With this changing\r\nclimate the species of conifers change, for each has become accustomed\r\nto certain conditions of temperature and moisture, which it must\r\nhave in order to thrive.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada is the most continuous lofty range of mountains\r\nin North America. From the great valley at its western base to the\r\ncrest of the range the distance is about sixty miles. Because of\r\nthe great height of the mountains, there is found within these few\r\nmiles every variety of climate between the sub-tropical atmosphere\r\nof the valley, where oranges ripen to perfection, and the arctic\r\ncold of the summits, where little or no vegetation can live.\r\n\r\nThus, by climbing a single mountain range, we may experience all\r\nkinds of climate, and have an opportunity to observe the different\r\nforms of plant life such as we could not otherwise obtain without\r\na journey of several thousand miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--FOREST BELT OF THE FOOT-HILLS, SIERRA\r\nNEVADA MOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nPassing through the groves of valley oak, and beyond the orange\r\norchards at the foot of the mountains, we reach the foot-hills\r\nand begin to ascend. Several species of oak are found upon the\r\nhillsides and in the valleys, while mingled with them in many places\r\nappear such shrubs as the California lilac, chamiso, and manzanita.\r\nWhere the soil is too poor or the slopes too steep for the trees,\r\nthese shrubs, commonly called \"chaparral,\" are massed together\r\nin almost impenetrable thickets.\r\n\r\nThe first of the coniferous trees which we meet is an odd-looking\r\none known as the digger pine. Instead of having a single straight\r\ntrunk it divides a short distance above the ground into many branches.\r\nThe large cones are armed with long hooked spines, so that they\r\nmust be handled rather carefully, but when opened they are found\r\nto be filled with nutritious nuts. These nuts were an important\r\nsource of food for the Indians who once inhabited the foot-hills.\r\nNow the Indians are gone, but the nuts are not wasted, if one may\r\njudge by the fragments of the cones with which the squirrels strew\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--THE DIGGER PINE]\r\n\r\nThe road climbs the foot-hills by many turns and windings through\r\ncanons and up and down ridges. At an elevation of about two thousand\r\nfeet specimens of the yellow pine appear. The trees increase in\r\nsize and grow more closely together as we ascend. We soon find\r\nourselves in the edge of the forest belt which extends unbroken\r\nnorthward to the arctic zone, and upward to the line of almost\r\nperpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThe yellow pine, so named from the color of the bark, sometimes\r\nattains a diameter of six feet, but does not form so dense forests\r\nas we shall find higher on the mountains. The rays of the warm\r\nsun, reaching down between the trees to the carpet of needles and\r\n\"bear clover,\" draw out their spicy fragrance. The yellow pine,\r\nalthough it does not afford as good a quality of lumber as some\r\nof the other pines, is one of our most important trees because of\r\nits wide distribution through nearly all mountains of the West.\r\nIt has a much wider range in elevation than most trees, one variety\r\nreaching upward nearly to the timber line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--A YELLOW PINE FOREST]\r\n\r\nAfter getting well into the yellow pine forest, we soon come upon\r\nother trees that contend with the pines for a footing upon the\r\nslopes and for a bit of the sunshine. Among these the black oaks\r\ndeserve special mention, for in places they form dense groves upon\r\nthe ridges. The cedars, with their rich brown bark and flat, drooping\r\nbranches, are easily recognized. As these trees grow old they become\r\ngnarled and knotty and very picturesque.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--SUGAR PINE]\r\n\r\nWe first meet that \"king of pines,\" the sugar pine, upon the more\r\nshaded mountain slopes. Although higher up, on barren, rocky ridges,\r\nthis tree grows to noble size, yet it cannot withstand heat and\r\ndryness. Our attention may be first called to the sugar pine by the\r\nslender cones, ten to fifteen inches in length, which are scattered\r\nover the ground. Then, as we look up to see whence the cones come, our\r\neyes light upon the smooth trunks, often over six feet in diameter\r\nand reaching up one hundred and fifty feet before the branches\r\nappear. From the ends of the long, drooping branches hang slender\r\ngreen cones. The name of this pine is derived from the fact that\r\na white sugar gathers in little bunches at the spots where the\r\ntrunk has been injured. This sugar is pleasant to the taste and\r\nsomewhat medicinal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--ZONE OF THE FIR FOREST, SIERRA NEVADA\r\nMOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nThe wood of the sugar pine, which is white and fine-grained, is\r\nof greater value commercially than that of any of the other pines.\r\nThis fact leads the shake-maker and lumberman to seek out the noble\r\ntree and mark it for destruction. The sugar pine, when once destroyed\r\nin a given locality, rarely replaces itself, as it is crowded out\r\nby the more vigorous conifers.\r\n\r\nScattered through the forests of yellow pine, cedar, and sugar\r\npine is the Douglas spruce, commonly known in the market as the\r\nOregon pine. This is the most important forest tree in Oregon and\r\nWashington. It often grows to a height of three hundred feet, and\r\nforms dense forests for hundreds of miles along the base and western\r\nslope of the Cascade Range. In Washington it is found growing down\r\nto the sea-level, but in the Sierra Nevada the requisite moisture\r\nfor its growth is not found much below an elevation of four thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAs we go upward the pines become fewer and the firs and \"Big Trees\"\r\ntake their places. The Big Trees are found in scattered groves,\r\nat an elevation of five thousand to eight thousand feet, for a\r\ndistance of two hundred and fifty miles along the slopes of the\r\nSierra Nevada mountains. The Sequoia, as the genus is called, which\r\nalso includes the redwood of the Coast ranges, is in many respects\r\nthe most remarkable of all our coniferous trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--THE BIG TREE FOREST IN THE SIERRA NEVADA\r\nMOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nAfter travelling through forests made up of other trees of great\r\nsize it is difficult at first to appreciate the magnitude of the\r\nBig Trees. Rising from a swelling base, which is sometimes thirty\r\nfeet in diameter, the symmetrical trunk reaches up and up, finally\r\nterminating in a top three hundred to three hundred and fifty feet\r\nabove the ground. Their size, their reddish-brown bark, and their\r\nsmall cones, clearly distinguish these trees. Great holes have\r\nbeen burned in many of them, and in the hollows thus formed men\r\nhave made for themselves comfortable living rooms. In one of the\r\nsouthern groves a fallen hollow tree has been used as a cabin.\r\n\r\nThe Big Trees and redwoods are the last surviving species of a\r\ngenus which was once widely distributed over the earth. The ancestry\r\nof the Sequoia can be traced farther back than that of any of the\r\nother living conifers. Impressions of cones and small stems with\r\nneedles attached belonging to the Sequoia have been found in the\r\noldest rocks of the Coast ranges of California. These cones and\r\nstems were washed into some muddy estuary and there buried, millions\r\nof years ago. The mud inclosing them was compressed and hardened,\r\nand finally changed to slate. This was at last exposed upon the\r\nsurface through the uplifting of a mountain range and the work\r\nof erosion.\r\n\r\nSome of the groves of the Big Trees have been included in government\r\nparks and reservations, but others are being cut as rapidly as\r\npossible by the lumbermen. The redwood of the Coast ranges is not\r\neasily killed, for it sprouts from the stump, and will in the course\r\nof time form forests again; but the Big Trees rarely replace themselves\r\nwhen a grove has been cut down. These trees are so few in number\r\nand of such remarkable interest that they should be spared the\r\nfate of the common forest tree.\r\n\r\nIt would make you feel sad to visit one of the groves and see,\r\nas I did, a fallen giant, fully thirty feet in diameter, lying\r\nsplit open upon the ground. This tree was so large that, in order\r\nthat it might be handled at all, powder had to be used to blast it\r\nin pieces. The tree was knotty, and according to the lumbermen,\r\nof little value, and might as well have been left. What excuse is\r\nthere for the wanton destruction of a noble tree like this one?\r\nIt must have stood from five thousand to six thousand years. It\r\nwas a mighty tree at the beginning of the Christian era, and was\r\ngrowing, a strong tree, when our ancestors were the rudest savages\r\nin the wilds of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut we must not remain among the Big Trees, for the forests extend\r\nmuch farther up the mountains. The most important tree of the upper\r\nforest belt is the fir, which is found growing from five thousand\r\nto nearly nine thousand feet above sea-level. It is one of the most\r\ngraceful of the conifers. Sometimes these trees reach a height\r\nof two hundred and fifty feet and form dense forests with little\r\nundergrowth. The branches make the soft, fragrant beds which so\r\nrest and delight the tired mountain climber. Here and there about\r\nthe springs and at the heads of the streamlets the firs appear to\r\nstand back, making room for green meadows brightened with a profusion\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--ALPINE HEMLOCKS]\r\n\r\nThe tamarack, or lodge-pole pine, is sometimes found at about the\r\nsame elevation as the firs, but seems to prefer the moist lands\r\nabout the meadows and the bottoms of the narrow valleys. This tree is\r\nwidely distributed at high altitudes all over our Western mountains.\r\n\r\nContinuing our climb toward the alpine regions, we reach an elevation\r\nwhere the trees begin to show the effects of the winter storms. The\r\nfact that life is not so easy as it is farther down the slopes is\r\napparent from the gnarled and stunted trunks. Here are the alpine\r\nhemlocks, dwarf pines, and junipers.\r\n\r\nThe juniper somewhat resembles the cedar, but has a short, thick\r\ntrunk. Near the timber line this tree grows but a few feet high\r\nand becomes exceedingly gnarled. It seems to like the most exposed\r\nand rocky places, but in truth, like many another form of plant\r\nlife, it has become accustomed to such locations because it cannot\r\nsuccessfully compete with other trees in happier ones.\r\n\r\nMost weird and picturesque of all are the dwarf white pines, growing\r\nupon the extensive mountain shoulders and ridges at a height of ten\r\nthousand to eleven thousand five hundred feet above the sea. Since\r\nan arctic climate surrounds them for nine months in the year, their\r\ngrowth is very slow. Their short, gnarled trunks and branches are\r\ntwisted into all sorts of fantastic shapes. When, after struggling\r\nwith the cold and the storms, the trees at last die, they do not\r\nquickly decay and fall, but continue to stand for many years.\r\n\r\nThese trees become smaller and smaller in size until at the extreme\r\ntimber line they are almost prostrate upon the ground. In many\r\ncases they rise only three or four feet, and have the appearance\r\nof shrubs rather than trees. Still above them, however, there are\r\nrocky slopes and snow-banks reaching to an elevation of over fourteen\r\nthousand feet. If we examine these upper slopes carefully we shall\r\nfind that they are not utterly devoid of life, but that certain\r\nplants have been able to obtain a foothold upon them. In sheltered\r\nnooks there are little shrubs and lichens. In some places among the\r\nrocks, beneath overhanging snow-banks, beautiful flowers spring\r\nup at the coming of the late summer, blossom, mature their seeds,\r\nand die with the return of the winter cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE TIMBER\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent forests through which we have passed in our long\r\nclimb, if destroyed by the lumberman, cannot be replaced for hundreds\r\nof years. They contribute much to the glory of the mountains. They\r\nhold back the water so that it does not run off rapidly, and thus\r\naid in giving rise to innumerable clear, cold springs. The springs\r\nhelp feed the streams during the long, dry summers, when the water\r\nis so sorely needed in the hot valleys below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL PARKS AND FOREST RESERVES\r\n\r\nThe people who first pushed into the unknown country west of the\r\nMississippi, in the earlier half of the last century, were chiefly\r\nhunters and trappers. They did not intend to make permanent homes\r\nin the wilds, but rather to stay only so long as they could secure\r\nan abundance of fur-bearing animals.\r\n\r\nThen came the discovery of the precious metals, and thousands of\r\ngold-seekers crossed the plains, and spread out over the mountains\r\nof the Cordilleran region. They, too, expected to get rich by making\r\nuse of the resources of the country, and return to their homes in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the destruction of our forests and serious injury\r\nto the water supply has been threatened through the organization of\r\nlarge lumber companies. Those interested in lumbering usually live\r\nfar removed from the scenes of their operations, and consequently\r\ncare little about the condition in which the deforested lands are\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe farmers were the first permanent occupants of the West. Unlike\r\nthe wandering trappers and miners, they established homes and made\r\nthe land richer instead of poorer. As long as the population was\r\nscanty there was not much danger of exterminating the wild animals,\r\nand the demands for timber were small.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers who settled the Eastern states had to contend with\r\nthe forests. Nearly every acre of ground had to be laboriously\r\ncleared before anything could be planted. It was only natural that\r\nthey should come to regard the forests as a hindrance rather than\r\na blessing.\r\n\r\nAs the settlers spread westward to the prairies and plains they\r\ncame upon a region almost destitute of forests; but still farther,\r\nin the mountains of the continental divide and the Pacific slope,\r\nthey again found extensive forests. To them it seemed impossible\r\nthat these forests could ever be exhausted, and therefore little\r\ncare was taken for their preservation.\r\n\r\nAs the population increased, more and more lumber was needed for\r\nbuilding purposes. Before the sawmill came split lumber was used,\r\nand the shake-maker did not hesitate to cut down the largest and\r\nmost valuable pines on the mere possibility that fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet of the butt would split well enough to make shakes. It made\r\nno difference to him that the whole trunk rotted upon the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the sawmills were built and there came a demand from abroad\r\nfor lumber, the forests were attacked upon a much larger scale.\r\nThe need of the moment was all that concerned the lumbermen, and\r\nthey took no care for the preservation of the young trees, which\r\nin time would have renewed the supply. The litter of the trunks\r\nand branches which they left upon the ground furnished fuel for\r\nthe fires which frequently swept over these areas and killed the\r\nremaining growth.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these fires, the few animals that have escaped the\r\nhunters have been killed or driven from their homes, and the forest\r\ncover, which would retain much of the moisture and preserve it\r\nfor the supply of the streams in summer, has been destroyed. The\r\nremoval of the forest cover leads also to the washing away of the\r\nsoil, the shoaling of the streams, floods in spring, and low water\r\nin summer. In fact, all the people and industries of the region\r\nare affected by its loss. It may take hundreds of years for the\r\ncountry to recover; indeed, if the rainfall is light, the forests\r\nmay never grow again, without artificial aid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--A BURNED FOREST, CASCADE RANGE, OREGON]\r\n\r\nThe careless stockman, seeking to enlarge his pastures by burning\r\nthe underbrush, sets fires which often destroy hundreds of square\r\nmiles of forest. The summer camper and the prospector also frequently\r\ngo on their way without extinguishing the camp fire, though a great\r\nforest fire may be the result.\r\n\r\nOurs is a fertile and productive earth, capable of supporting a\r\nmultitude of living things. For ages the lower animals, as well\r\nas savage man, lived under the protection of Nature, making the\r\nbest use of her products of which they were capable; but they never\r\nbrought about the unnecessary, and often wanton, destruction of\r\nwhich we are guilty,--we, who call ourselves civilized. In killing\r\nthe wild animals we cannot make the plea of necessity, as can savages\r\nwho have no other means of support. Likewise, there is no necessity\r\nfor killing the beautiful singing birds, merely for their plumage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--EROSION UPON AN UNPROTECTED SLOPE]\r\n\r\nThe forests are cut away without any thought of the retribution\r\nwhich Nature is sure to bring upon us. They are of vast importance\r\nto the well-being of the country and are the natural possession\r\nof all its people. We ought not to permit them to be destroyed\r\nindiscriminately for the benefit of a few. We need lumber for many\r\npurposes; but a careful treatment of the forests with an eye to\r\ntheir continuance, the plan of cutting large trees, and preserving\r\nthe small ones, is a very different thing from our present wasteful\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nEvery summer the air is filled with the smoke of burning forests,\r\nand the lumbermen are at work harder than ever felling virgin forests\r\nupon more and more remote mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nBooks of travel written fifty years ago tell of animal life in\r\nsuch abundance in many portions of the West that we can hardly\r\nbelieve their stories. A description of California written in 1848\r\nmentions elk, antelope, and deer as abundant in the Great Valley.\r\nHow many of us living at the present time have ever seen one of\r\nthese animals in its native haunts?\r\n\r\nThere is hope now that this wasteful use of Nature's gifts will\r\nsoon be stopped. Large areas of the mountainous portions of the\r\npublic domain are being set aside as parks and forest reserves.\r\nThe parks contain some of the finest scenery and most wonderful\r\nnatural curiosities to be found upon the face of the whole earth.\r\nThis wild scenery, together with the forests and plants of every\r\nkind, as well as the animals and birds that inhabit these areas,\r\nare to remain just as they were when the first white man looked\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe parks form asylums for the wild creatures which have been hard\r\npressed for so many years. In the Yellowstone National Park, where\r\nthey have been protected the longest, the animals have almost lost\r\ntheir fear of man and act as if they knew that they are safe within\r\nits limits. In the Yellowstone you may see great herds of elk feeding\r\nin the rich meadows; deer stand by the roadside and watch you pass,\r\nwhile the bears have become so tame about the hotels that they\r\nmake themselves a nuisance. Sixteen bears at a time have been seen\r\nfeeding at the garbage pile near the Grand Canon hotel.\r\n\r\nThe forest reserves differ from the parks in that they are established\r\nfor utility rather than for pleasure. The forests now existing\r\nare to be cared for by the government and to be wisely used when\r\nlumber is needed. Fires are to be avoided so far as possible, and\r\nburned areas are to be replanted with trees. Another object to be\r\naccomplished is the retention of the forests about the heads of\r\nthe streams so as to preserve the summer water supply. The water\r\nruns off more slowly from a slope covered with vegetation than\r\nfrom a barren one, and therefore has more time to soak into the\r\nground. This is a very important matter in all mountainous districts,\r\nparticularly where the rainfall is light.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone National Park is situated upon the continental\r\ndivide in northwestern Wyoming. It is largely a plateau, with an\r\nelevation of seven thousand to eight thousand feet above the level\r\nof the sea. The surface of the plateau is covered with forests,\r\nmeadows, and lakes; but the region is particularly remarkable for\r\nthe geysers and hot springs, and the Grand Canon and falls of the\r\nYellowstone River.\r\n\r\nSprings dot the surface of many parts of the park. The hot water\r\nis continually bringing mineral substances, the chief of which is\r\nsilica, from the depths of the earth and depositing them about the\r\norifices of the springs. In this manner wonderful basins, terraces,\r\nand cones have been built up, while the rocks have been either\r\nreddened or bleached out and softened into a form of clay.\r\n\r\nThe park region must have been for a long period the seat of volcanic\r\naction, for nearly all the rocks are cooled lavas. While the heat\r\nhas disappeared from the surface, it must still be very great below,\r\nif we may judge by the quantities of hot water continually issuing\r\nfrom the springs.\r\n\r\nIn many a subterranean cavern steam accumulates until its pressure\r\nbecomes too great for the column of water occupying the channel\r\nthat leads to the surface; then the water is suddenly and forcibly\r\nexpelled, giving rise to a geyser eruption. When the pressure of\r\nthe steam has become exhausted, the water sinks back into the earth,\r\nleaving the basin of the geyser nearly or quite empty until the steam\r\nhas again collected. Each geyser has its own period of eruption\r\nand is generally very regular. One little geyser, known as the\r\nEconomic, because it throws out but little water, spouts regularly\r\nabout every five minutes. Other geysers are active at intervals of\r\nseveral hours, while some take several years to get ready for a\r\nnew eruption and then spout whole rivers of boiling water. In the\r\nUpper Geyser Basin the effect is very impressive, particularly upon\r\na cool morning. The clouds of steam and the throbbing or roaring\r\ngeysers lend to the region a weird and unearthly aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone Lake is a large body of water situated almost upon\r\nthe continental divide. Before the canon, or Great Falls, or even\r\nthe Yellowstone River itself existed, the lake stood about one\r\nhundred and fifty feet higher than at present, and its water emptied\r\ninto the Pacific Ocean instead of the Gulf of Mexico. The drainage\r\nwas changed by the work of a small stream having its source in\r\nthe volcanic plateau north of the lake. It deepened its channel\r\nand extended its head waters back until they tapped the lake at\r\na point where the rim of the basin was lowest, and so drew away\r\nits waters in the opposite direction. The Yellowstone River, with\r\nits deep, wondrously colored canon and grand waterfalls, is the\r\nresult of this change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--ECONOMIC GEYSER, YELLOWSTONE PARK]\r\n\r\nTo the south of Yellowstone Park, but included in one of the forest\r\nreserves, are Jackson Lake and the Teton range. The Three Tetons,\r\none of which reaches a height of over thirteen thousand feet, were\r\nevidently noted landmarks for the hunters and trappers in the early\r\ndays, for you will find them mentioned in many of the narratives of\r\nthose times. The precipitous range, with its crown of jagged peaks\r\nand the beautiful lake nestling at its base, presents a picture\r\nnever to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nVery different from the region which we have been studying is that\r\nembracing the Crater Lake, National Park, which is situated upon\r\nthe summit of the Cascade Range in southern Oregon. Here occurred,\r\nnot many thousand years ago, one of the strangest catastrophes\r\nwhich, so far as we know, has ever overtaken any portion of our\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nTowering over the present basin of Crater Lake was a great volcano,\r\nreaching, probably, nearly three miles toward the sky. During the\r\nglacial period it stood there, its slopes white with snow, apparently\r\nas strong and firm as Shasta or Hood or Ranier. But for some reason\r\nthe volcanic forces within this mountain, which has been called\r\nMazama, awoke to renewed action. The interior of the mountain was\r\nmelted, and the whole mass, unable to stand longer, fell in and\r\nwas engulfed in the fiery, seething lava. This lava, instead of\r\nwelling up and filling the crater and perhaps flowing out, was\r\ndrawn down through the throat of the volcano into the earth, and\r\nleft an enormous pit or crater where once the mountain stood.\r\n\r\nAfter the floor of the crater cooled and hardened, small eruptions\r\noccurred within it and a new volcano grew up, but, though nearly three\r\nthousand feet high, it does not reach to the top of the encircling\r\nwalls of the old crater, which are, on an average, nearly four\r\nthousand feet high.\r\n\r\nThen the rains and melting snows formed a body of water in the\r\ncrater, and the wonderful lake came into existence. No such sight\r\nis to be found elsewhere upon the earth. Within a circling rim of\r\ncliffs, from eight hundred to two thousand feet high and nearly\r\nvertical, lies the lake, rivalling the sky in the depth of its blue\r\ncoloring. The height of its encircling cliffs and its five-mile\r\nexpanse of blue water help to make the lake a spectacle grand beyond\r\ndescription. At the present time the volcanic fires appear to be\r\nentirely extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--CRATER LAKE\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the cliffs two thousand feet above. Upon the right\r\nis Wizard Island, a volcanic cone]\r\n\r\nForests of fir and tamarack have spread over the once barren slopes\r\nof lava and pumice which extend back from the cliffs. In the hollows,\r\nafter the lingering winter snows have melted, there are grassy\r\nmeadows dotted with flowers. It is many miles from the lake to\r\nany human habitation, and all the region about remains just as\r\nNature left it. It was a happy thought to make another national\r\npark here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--THE PUNCH BOWL, YELLOWSTONE PARK]\r\n\r\nWe have already learned something of the grandeur of the Yosemite\r\nValley and have seen how it came into existence. The valley is\r\nowned and cared for as a public park by the state of California,\r\nbut, with Hetch-Hetchy Valley, it is included in a larger park\r\nunder the control of the general government. Within the boundaries\r\nof this national park, as in the case of the others described, the\r\nnatural features of the landscape, the forests, and the animals,\r\nare to be left forever undisturbed. The Yosemite Valley, although\r\nsituated in the heart of the rugged Sierras, is reached by several\r\ngood wagon roads and many more people visit it than go to Crater\r\nLake, although the latter is fully as interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--THE FALLS OF THE YELLOWSTONE, YELLOWSTONE\r\nCANON]\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred miles south of the Yosemite is the General Grant\r\nNational Park. This park is of comparatively small size, but contains\r\na group of some of the largest and finest Big Trees in the country.\r\nStill farther south there is a reserve called the Sequoia Park,\r\nwhich contains the largest remaining groves of the Big Trees.\r\n\r\nThere are also many state parks scattered over different parts of\r\nthe Union. The establishment of these parks is intended to preserve\r\neither the forests or natural scenery.\r\n\r\nThe retention by the state or general government of large tracts of\r\nmountain and timber land, and of those areas which are particularly\r\ninteresting on account of their natural scenery, is of the greatest\r\nimportance. The timber and water are preserved for the general good\r\ninstead of being squandered for the enrichment of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of scenic features in their original wild state\r\nis just and right, because such things add to the pleasure of\r\nout-of-door life, elevate men's feelings, and cultivate a love for\r\nthe beautiful. The protection afforded the plant and animal life\r\nby these reserves gives a better opportunity for studying them,\r\nand tends to foster a general interest in the welfare of living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEATH READERS\r\n\r\nA new series, that excels in its\r\n\r\n  1.

They do this without waste of time or\r\neffort, and at the same time that the books aid pupils in acquiring\r\nskill in reading, they present material which is in itself worth\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the HEATH READERS is, _first_, to enable beginners\r\nto master the mechanical difficulties of reading successfully and\r\nin the shortest time; _second_, to develop the imagination and\r\ncultivate a taste for the best literature; _third_, to appeal to those\r\nmotives that lead to right conduct, industry, courage, patriotism,\r\nand loyalty to duty. The larger purpose is, briefly, to aid in\r\ndeveloping an appreciation of that which is of most worth in life\r\nand literature.\r\n\r\nThe series contains seven books, as follows:\r\n\r\nPrimer, 128 pages, 25 cents.        | Fourth Reader, 320 pages, 45 cents.\r\nFirst Reader, 130 pages, 25 cents.  | Fifth Reader, 352 pages, 50 cents.\r\nSecond Reader, 176 pages, 35 cents. | Sixth Reader, 352 pages, 50 cents.\r\nThird Reader, 256 pages, 40 cents.  |\r\n\r\n_Descriptive circulars sent free on request._\r\n\r\nD.
