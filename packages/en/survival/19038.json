Owners of farms and suburban estates everywhere are\r\nbecoming interested in the raising of this delicious article of\r\nfood, thousands of trees being set out every year.\r\n\r\nThere are two important reasons for the rapidly growing\r\nenthusiasm that is being manifested toward the English Walnut:\r\nFirst, its exceptional value as a food property is becoming\r\nwidely recognized, one pound of walnut meat being equal in\r\nnutriment to eight pounds of steak. Secondly, its superior worth\r\nas an ornamental shade tree is admitted by everyone who knows the\r\nfirst thing about trees. For this purpose there is nothing more\r\nbeautiful. With their wide-spreading branches and dark-green\r\nfoliage, they are a delight to the eye. Unlike the leaves of some\r\nof our shade trees, those of this variety do not drop during the\r\nSummer but adhere until late in the Fall, thus making an\r\nunusually clean tree for lawn or garden. In addition to all this,\r\nthe walnut is particularly free from scale and other pests.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, the English Walnut has been more largely\r\nin demand as a shade tree than as a commercial proposition; in\r\nfact, so little attention has been given to the nuts themselves\r\nthat there are, comparatively speaking, few large producing\r\norchards in the United States, the greater portion of the total\r\nyield of walnuts being procured from scattered field and roadside\r\ntrees. It is a little difficult to understand why they should\r\nhave been so neglected when there are records of single trees\r\nbearing as much as 800 pounds of nuts in one year.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SIX YEAR OLD BEARING ENGLISH WALNUT TREE]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 this country produced about 4,000,000 pounds, and more\r\nthan 16,000,000 pounds of English Walnuts in 1907, with a\r\nproportionate annual increase each year to the present. But, when\r\nit is known that the United States is consuming yearly about\r\n50,000,000 pounds of nuts, with the demand constantly increasing,\r\nthereby necessitating the importation annually of something more\r\nthan 25,000,000 pounds, the wonderful possibilities of the\r\nindustry in this country, from a purely business view point, will\r\nreadily be appreciated. And of course the market price of the\r\nwalnut is keeping step with the consumption, having advanced from\r\n15 to 20 cents a pound in the past few years.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =A Rival of the Orange=]\r\n\r\nIn California the nut industry is becoming a formidable rival of\r\nthe orange; in fact, there are more dollars worth of nuts (all\r\nvarieties) shipped from the state now per year than oranges. One\r\ngrower is shipping $136,000 worth of English Walnuts a year while\r\nanother man, with an orchard just beginning to bear, is getting\r\nabout $200 an acre for his crop.\r\n\r\nNo standard estimate can at present be placed on the yield per\r\nacre of orchards in full bearing, but the growers are confident\r\nthat they will soon be deriving from $800 to $1600 per acre, this\r\nfigure being based on the number of individual trees which are\r\nalready producing from $90 to $120 a year. The success with the\r\nnut in California can be duplicated in the East providing certain\r\nhardy varieties are planted; and in the few instances where\r\norchards have been started in the East, great things have already\r\nbeen done and still greater are expected in the next few years.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Origin of the English Walnut=]\r\n\r\nBut where did this walnut originate? What is its history? Juglans\r\nRegia (nut of the gods) Persian Walnut, called also Madeira Nut\r\nand English Walnut, is a native of Western, Central and probably\r\nEastern Asia, the home of the peach and the apricot. It was known\r\nto the Greeks, who introduced it from Persia into Europe at an\r\nearly day, as \"Persicon\" or \"Persian\" nut and \"Basilicon\" or\r\n\"Royal\" nut. Carried from Greece to Rome, it became \"Juglans\"\r\n(name derived from Jovis and glans, an acorn; literally\r\n\"Jupiter's Acorn\", or \"the Nut of the Gods\"). From Rome it was\r\ndistributed throughout Continental Europe, and according to\r\nLoudon, it reached England prior to 1562. In England it is\r\ngenerally known as the walnut, a term of Anglo-Saxon derivation\r\nsignifying \"foreign nut\". It has been called Madeira Nut,\r\npresumably because the fruit was formerly imported into England\r\nfrom the Madeira Islands, where it is yet grown to some extent.\r\nIn America it has commonly been known as English Walnut to\r\ndistinguish it from our native species. From the fact that of all\r\nthe names applied to this nut \"Persian\" seems to have been the\r\nfirst in common use, and that it indicates approximately the home\r\nof the species, the name \"Persian Walnut\" is regarded as most\r\nsuitable, but inasmuch as \"English Walnut\" is better known here,\r\nwe shall use that name in this treatise.\r\n\r\nAs a material for the manufacture of gunstocks and furniture the\r\ntimber of the nut was long in great demand throughout Europe and\r\nhigh prices were paid for it. Early in the last century as much\r\nas $3,000 was paid for a single large tree for the making of\r\ngunstocks.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Planting and Cultivation=]\r\n\r\nEverything depends upon the planting and cultivation of English\r\nWalnuts as indeed it does of all other fruits from which the very\r\nbest results are desired. The following general rules should be\r\nthoroughly mastered.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PLANT ENGLISH WALNUT TREES:\r\n\r\n    On any well-drained land where the sub-soil moisture is not\r\n      more than ten or twelve feet from the surface.\r\n\r\n    Wherever Oaks, Black Walnuts or other tap-root nut trees\r\n      will grow.\r\n\r\n    Forty to sixty feet apart.\r\n\r\n    In holes eighteen inches in diameter and thirty inches\r\n      deep.\r\n\r\n    Two inches deeper than the earth mark showing on the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AND REMEMBER:\r\n\r\n    That the trees need plenty of good, rich soil about their\r\n      roots.\r\n\r\n    That the trees should be inclined slightly toward\r\n      prevailing winds.\r\n\r\n    That the trees should not be cut back.\r\n\r\n    That the ground cannot be packed too hard around the roots\r\n      and the tree.\r\n\r\n    That the trees should be mulched in the Fall.\r\n\r\n    That the ground should be kept cultivated around the trees\r\n      during the Spring and Summer.\r\n\r\n    That English Walnut trees should be transplanted while\r\n      young, as they will often double in size the year the\r\n      tap-root reaches the sub-soil moisture (that is, the\r\n      moist earth).\r\n\r\n    That tap-root trees are the easiest of all to transplant if\r\n      the work is done while the trees are young and small.\r\n\r\n    That trees sometimes bear the third year after\r\n      transplanting three-year-old trees where the sub-soil\r\n      moisture is within six or eight feet of the surface.\r\n\r\n    That the age of bearing depends largely on the distance the\r\n      tap-root has to grow to reach the sub-soil moisture.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Peculiarities of Growth=]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the English Walnut is different from that of most\r\nfruit trees. The small trees grow about six inches the first\r\nyear, tap-root the same; the second year they grow about twelve\r\ninches, tap-root the same; the third year they grow about\r\neighteen inches, tap-root nearly as much. For the first three\r\nyears the tap-root seems to gain most of the nourishment, and at\r\nthe end of the third year, or about that time, the tree itself\r\nstarts its real growth. After the tap-root reaches the sub-soil\r\nmoisture, the tree often grows as much in one year as it has in\r\nthe preceding three or four. If the trees are transplanted\r\nprevious to the time that the tap-root reaches this moisture and\r\nbefore the tree starts its rapid growth, very few young trees are\r\nlost in the process of transplanting.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Orchard Planting=]\r\n\r\nFor orchard planting the trees should be placed from forty to\r\nsixty feet apart and by staggering the rows a greater distance is\r\ngained between individual trees. Any other small fruits may be\r\nplanted in the orchard between the walnut trees or any cultivated\r\ncrop can be raised satisfactorily on the same land, many\r\norchardists gaining triple use of the soil in this way. Besides,\r\nthe cultivation of the earth in proximity to the walnuts proves\r\nof great benefit to the trees. Before trees are planted the\r\ntap-root should be trimmed or cut back and most if not all the\r\nlateral branches trimmed from the tree. The tree itself should\r\nnot be cut back as is customary with either fruit trees, but by\r\nleaving the terminal bud intact, a much better shaped tree is\r\ndeveloped. It is not necessary to prune English Walnut trees\r\nexcept in cases where some of the lower branches interfere with\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nCultivation in the North should be stopped about the first of\r\nAugust, thus halting the growth of the trees and giving them a\r\nchance to harden their wood for Winter. This is a good plan to\r\nfollow in the cultivation of nearly all the smaller fruit trees.\r\n\r\nWhen planting on the lawn for ornamental purposes a ring from two\r\nto three feet in diameter should be cultivated about the base of\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Selection of Varieties=]\r\n\r\nThe tender varieties that have been used in Southern California\r\nmust not be experimented with in the North, as they bloom too\r\nearly and are almost certain to be caught by the frost. These\r\nvarieties have been tried in Northern California without success,\r\nand the venture is quite likely to be disastrous in any but the\r\nwarmest climates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MR. E.C. POMEROY, GATHERING ENGLISH WALNUTS ON\r\n  HIS FARM IN LOCKPORT, N.Y.]\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of a crop is often due to the very early blooming\r\nof the kinds planted. These start to grow at the first warm spell\r\nin the latter part of the Winter or at the first blush of Spring,\r\nand almost invariably become victims of frost and consequently\r\nproduce no fruit.\r\n\r\nPlanting in the Northwest and the East until recently has been\r\nlimited to an extremely narrow area. There was need of a variety\r\npossessing strong, distinct characteristics, hardy, late to start\r\ngrowth, and with the pistillate and staminate blossoms maturing\r\nat the same time and bearing a nut of good quality and flavor\r\nwith a full rich meat. This variety has now been found, as will\r\nlater be shown.\r\n\r\nEnglish Walnuts grown in the North command from three to five\r\ncents more a pound than the other nuts in the markets, as the\r\nmeat is plumper and the flavor better. Most fruit is at its best\r\nat the Northern limit of its range.\r\n\r\nOne experienced grower, in reference to transplanting has said:\r\n\"I have transplanted all the way from a year to six and the\r\ntrees have grown and done well, but so far as my experience goes,\r\nI prefer to move them at three years of age or about that time.\r\nThe best trees I have were transplanted at this age.\"\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Fall or Spring Planting?=]\r\n\r\nThe following extract on tree planting in general, pertaining to\r\nall kinds of trees, is contributed by O.K. White of the Michigan\r\nExperiment Station:\r\n\r\n   \"The advisability of Fall or Spring planting depends upon\r\n   several conditions. Fall planting has the advantage over\r\n   Spring planting in that the trees become firmly established\r\n   in the soil before Winter sets in, and are able to start\r\n   growth in the Spring before the ground can be marked and put\r\n   in condition for planting. This is important because the\r\n   trees get a good growth in the early part of the season\r\n   before the Summer droughts occur. On the other hand there is\r\n   more or less danger from Winter injury during a severe\r\n   season or from the drying out of the trees if the Winter\r\n   is long and dry. Fall planting is much more successful with\r\n   the hardy apples and pears than it is with the tender plums,\r\n   cherries and peaches.\r\n\r\n   \"The convenience of the season will determine in a majority\r\n   of cases whether or not the planting shall be done in the\r\n   Fall or Spring. Very often the rush of the Spring work\r\n   induces the grower to hurry his planting, or to do it\r\n   carelessly; and as a result a poor start is secured, with\r\n   crooked rows. Others have large crops to harvest in the Fall\r\n   and would find it more convenient to do the planting in the\r\n   Spring. If there is any doubt as to the best time to plant,\r\n   let it be in the Spring.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRTY YEAR OLD PARENT ENGLISH WALNUT TREES IN\r\nBACKGROUND, YOUNG BEARING TREE IN FRONT]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Fertilizing=]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subject of fertilization. Up to the time when\r\nthe young trees come into bearing, cultivation and fertilization\r\nwill help them enormously, the cultivation keeping the soil in\r\ncondition to hold the moisture of the tree. In fertilizing, a\r\nmulch of stable manure in the Fall is considered by most growers\r\nto be the best, but the following preparation is thought to be\r\nexceptionally good for all young orchards:\r\n\r\nDried blood, 1,000 pounds; bone meal, 550 pounds; sulphate of\r\npotash, 350 pounds. Total, 2,000 pounds. This should be applied\r\nclose up and about the tree, extending out each year in a circle\r\nsomewhat beyond the spread of the branches.\r\n\r\nThis provides a quickly available plant food, rich in nitrogen\r\nand especially recommended for rapid growth.\r\n\r\nAfter the tap-root reaches the sub-soil moisture it is well able\r\nto take care of the tree; and both cultivation and fertilization\r\nmay then be stopped. In fact, by this time practically no further\r\ncare is needed in the nut orchard with the exception of that\r\nrequired at the harvesting time, and this is a pleasant and easy\r\noccupation, especially in the Northern and Eastern states where\r\nthe frost opens the shuck and the nuts drop free upon the ground\r\nwhere they may be picked up and put into sacks of 110 to 120\r\npounds each, ready for the market.\r\n\r\nJust before the first frost it is a very good idea to remove all\r\nleaves from the ground so that when the nuts fall they can be\r\nreadily seen and gathered. An excellent method of accomplishing\r\nthis is by means of a horse and rake. The nuts may be left on the\r\nground to dry or may be removed to any convenient place for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =The Different Kinds=]\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct kinds of English Walnuts--hard-shell,\r\nsoft-shell and paper-shell, the soft-shell being the best. Each\r\nof these three is divided into a number of varieties, the names\r\nof some of the more popular ones being the Barthere, Chaberte,\r\nCluster, Drew, Ford, Franquette, Gant or Bijou, Grand Noblesse,\r\nLanfray, Mammoth, Mayette, Wiltz Mayette, Mesange, Meylan,\r\nMission, Parisienne, Poorman, Proeparturiens, Santa Barbara,\r\nPomeroy, Serotina, Sexton, Vourey, Concord, Chase and the Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe question of the best varieties for planting in the North as\r\nwell as in the South is somewhat open to discussion, due largely\r\nto a lack of sufficient information in regard to some of the more\r\npromising kinds. There is but little question that the best\r\nproven variety for the Northwest is the Franquette and for the\r\nEast and Northeast, the Pomeroy. Both of these are good producers\r\nbearing a fine nut, well filled with a white meat of excellent\r\nflavor, and of good shape and commanding the highest market\r\nprices. The two varieties are also very late in starting in the\r\nSpring making them safe against the late frosts. Their pistillate\r\nand staminate blossoms mature at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH WALNUTS BEAR IN CLUSTERS OF TWO TO\r\nFIVE]\r\n\r\nThe white-meated nut is far superior to any other. The browning\r\nor staining is caused by the extremely dry heat and sun in the\r\nfar South. In the North or where the tree has an abundant thick\r\nfoliage the meat is invariably whiter.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =The Mission Nut=]\r\n\r\nThe Mission Nut was introduced by the priests of Los Angeles and\r\nis the pioneer Persian Walnut of California. Most of the bearing\r\norchards of the state are composed of seedling trees of this\r\ntype. The nut is medium-sized with a hard shell of ordinary\r\nthickness. It succeeds admirably in a few favored districts (of\r\nSouthern California) but fails in productiveness farther North.\r\nIts most prominent faults are--early blooming, in consequence of\r\nwhich it is often caught by the late frosts; the irregular and\r\nunequal blooming of its pistillate and staminate blossoms, and\r\nthe consequent failure of the former to be fertilized and to\r\ndevelop nuts; and lateness in ripening its wood in the Fall and\r\nconsequent liability to injury by frost at that time.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =The Santa Barbara Nut=]\r\n\r\nThe Santa Barbara English Walnut (soft-shell) variety is about\r\nten days later than the Mission in starting growth and in\r\nblooming in the Spring. It fruits from four to six years from\r\nseed and usually produces a full crop every year. It is not as\r\nstrong a grower as the Mission and more trees can be grown to the\r\nacre. The shells are thin and easily broken, therefore the nuts\r\nare sometimes damaged in long shipment. The kernel is white and\r\nof very fine quality.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =The Pomeroy Nut=]\r\n\r\nThe Pomeroy variety was started in a most peculiar and\r\ninteresting way. The late Norman Pomeroy of Lockport, New York,\r\nmade the discovery quite by accident. When he was in Philadelphia\r\nin 1876 visiting the Centennial Exposition, he awoke one morning\r\nto be greeted by the leaves of a gorgeous tree, which just\r\ntouched his window and through which the sun shone brightly. He\r\nsoon was examining a magnificent English Walnut tree. On the\r\nground directly under he found the nuts, which had fallen during\r\nthe night. Their flavor was more delicious and the meat fuller\r\nthan any he had ever before tasted. The shell was unusually thin\r\nand Mr. Pomeroy was astonished, for he never believed the English\r\nWalnut grew in the East.\r\n\r\nKnowing the varieties grown in California could not be raised in\r\nthe East or North, he questioned his landlord and found that this\r\nparticular tree had been brought from Northern Europe. Mr.\r\nPomeroy determined at once that possibly this variety would be\r\nhardy enough for cultivation in New York State. He procured some\r\nof the nuts and put them in his satchel which he entrusted to a\r\nneighbor who was about to start home. The neighbor reached home\r\nall right and so did the nuts--but--the neighbor's children found\r\nthe rare delicacies and ate all but seven. They would doubtless\r\nhave eaten these too but fortunately they had slipped into the\r\nlining of the satchel where Mr. Pomeroy found them on his return\r\nto Lockport. These seven nuts, which had so narrow an escape from\r\noblivion, are now seven beautiful English Walnut trees, sixty or\r\nmore feet high and the progenitors of the Pomeroy orchards, all\r\nof which are now producing nuts like the originals--a very fine\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Some uses of English Walnuts=]\r\n\r\nEnglish Walnuts to be used for making pickles, catsup, oil and\r\nother culinary products, are gathered when the fruit is about\r\nhalf mature or when the shell is soft enough to yield to the\r\ninfluence of cooking. The proper stage can be determined by\r\npiercing the nut with a needle, a certain degree of hardness\r\nbeing desired. The nut is often utilized for olive oil in some\r\nparts of Europe. It takes one hundred pounds of nuts to make\r\neighteen pounds of oil.\r\n\r\nIn England the nuts are preserved fresh for the table where they\r\nare served with wine. They are buried deep in dry soil or sand so\r\nas not to be reached by frost, the sun's rays or rain; or by\r\nplacing them in dry cellars and covering with straw. Others seal\r\nthem up in tin cans filled with sand.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: =Examples of Hardiness=]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the hardiness of the English Walnut, there\r\nis a tree at Red Hill, Virginia, which was brought from\r\nEdinburgh, Scotland, when six months old, planted in New York,\r\nwhere it remained three years, then removed to Staunton,\r\nVirginia, and after two years taken to Red Hill. In consequence\r\nof so many changes, the tree at first died back, but is now\r\nthrifty--twenty feet high; trunk, eight inches in diameter at the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nDuring several severe Winters, the thermometer fell so low that\r\nsome peach trees and grape vines growing near English Walnuts on\r\nthe Pomeroy farm near Lockport, N.Y. were killed, while the nut\r\ntrees were not in the least injured.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The English Walnut at its Best._\r\n\r\n\r\n    A smooth, soft-shelled nut.\r\n\r\n    Meat full, with sweet, hickory-nut flavor.\r\n\r\n    Nuts fall clean and free from outside shuck.\r\n\r\n    Frosts harvest the nuts--in October.\r\n\r\n    They are self-pruning.\r\n\r\n    Require no care after arrival at bearing age.\r\n\r\n    An alkali sap keeps scales and pests from the trees.\r\n\r\n    Blossoms immune from late frosts, as they start late.\r\n\r\n    Pistillate and Staminate blossoms mature at same time in\r\n      the best varieties, insuring perfect fertilization and\r\n      productivity.\r\n\r\n    Bears more regularly than other nut trees.\r\n\r\n    Bears heavier crops the older it becomes, unlike other\r\n      fruit trees the size and quality of whose fruit\r\n      degenerates with age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interesting Figures about the English Walnut._\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Spain and Southern France there are trees believed to\r\n      be more than 300 years old which bear from fifteen to\r\n      eighteen bushels of nuts each, annually.\r\n\r\n    In Whittier, California, is a famous tree which has been\r\n      leased for a term of years at $500.\r\n\r\n    Orchards seven and eight years old bring all the way from\r\n      $1,000 to $2,000 per acre and are a fine investment,\r\n      yielding from 15 to 125 per cent. according to age.\r\n\r\n    The total cost of producing and harvesting an English\r\n      Walnut crop is about one and one-half cents a pound.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kernels of Fact about the English Walnut._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The United States consumes more than 50,000,000 pounds a\r\n      year.\r\n\r\n    The United States imports about 27,000,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\n    The price is advancing steadily with the demand.\r\n\r\n    Besides being profitable, the English Walnut is a clean,\r\n      highly ornamental shade tree.\r\n\r\n    The leaves remain on the tree until late in the Fall, not\r\n      littering up the ground during the Summer.\r\n\r\n    English Walnuts are not only a rare table delicacy, but may\r\n      be utilized for catsup, pickles and oil.\r\n\r\n    One pound of walnut meat equals eight pounds of steak in\r\n      nutriment--and is a far more healthful food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Luther Burbank has to say:_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When you plant another tree, why not plant the English Walnut?\r\nThen, besides sentiment, shade and leaves, you may have a\r\nperennial supply of nuts, the improved kind of which furnish the\r\nmost delicious, nutritious and healthful food which has ever been\r\nknown. The consumption of nuts is probably increasing among all\r\ncivilized nations today faster than that of any other food; and\r\nwe should keep up with this growing demand and make it still more\r\nrapid by producing nuts of uniform good quality, with a\r\nconsequent increase in the health and a permanent increase in the\r\nwealth of ourselves and neighbors.\"--_From Address at Santa Rosa,\r\nCalifornia, in the Fall of 1905._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical error corrected in text:               |\r\n    |                                                      |\r\n    | Page 21: suceeds replaced with succeeds              |\r\n    |                                                      |\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
