Sally Scott glided\r\nto the one wide window in her room and pulled down the shade. Then, with\r\nmovements that somehow suggested deep secrecy, she took an oblong, black\r\nbox, not unlike an overnight bag, from the closet. After placing this\r\nwith some care on her study table, she pressed a button, and caught the\r\nbroad side of the box, that, falling away, revealed a neat row of\r\nbuttons and switches. Above these was an inch-wide opening where a\r\nnumber of spots shone dimly.\r\n\r\nAfter a glance over her shoulder, Sally shook her head, tossing her\r\nreddish-brown hair about, fixed her eyes on this strange box and then\r\nwith her long, slender, nervous fingers threw on a switch, another, and\r\nyet another in quick succession. Settling back in her chair, she watched\r\nthe spots above the switches turn into tiny, gleaming, red lamps that\r\ngave off an eerie light.\r\n\r\n“Red for blood, black for death,” someone had said to her. She shuddered\r\nat the thought.\r\n\r\nFrom the box came a low, humming sound. She turned a switch. The hum\r\nincreased. She turned it again and once more the hum rose in intensity.\r\nThis time, however, it was different. Suddenly the hum was broken by a\r\nlow, indistinct hut—hut—gr—gr—gr—hut—hut—hut.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” The girl’s lips parted as a look of surprise and almost of triumph\r\nspread over her face.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, she started to leap from her chair. A key had\r\nrattled in the door.\r\n\r\nBefore she could decide what she should do, the door swung open and\r\nsomeone snapped on a light.\r\n\r\nAnd then a voice said, “Oh! I’m sorry! I’ve been in the bright sunlight.\r\nThe room seemed completely dark.”\r\n\r\n“It really doesn’t matter,” Sally spoke slowly, studying the other\r\ngirl’s face as she did so. The girl was large and tall. Her hair was jet\r\nblack. She had a round face and dark, friendly eyes. This much Sally\r\nlearned at a glance. “It doesn’t matter,” she repeated. “I suppose we\r\nare to be roommates.”\r\n\r\n“It looks that way,” the other girl agreed. “I just arrived.” She set\r\nher bag on the floor.\r\n\r\n“I see.” Sally was still thinking her way along. “Then I suppose you\r\ndon’t know that we are not allowed to have radios in our rooms.”\r\n\r\n“No—I—”\r\n\r\n“But you see, I have one,” Sally went on. “I suppose I could be sent\r\nhome for keeping it, but I’m going to chance it. I—I’ve just got to.\r\nIt—it’s terribly important that I keep it. It—well, you can see it’s\r\nnot like other radios. It’s got—”\r\n\r\n“Red eyes,” the other girl said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but that’s not all. You couldn’t listen to a program on it if you\r\ntried. It—it’s very different. There are only two others like it in all\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the new girl.\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t, see at all,” Sally declared. “You couldn’t possibly. The\r\nonly question right now is: will you share my secret? Can I count on\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the black-haired girl replied simply. And she meant just that.\r\nSally was sure of it.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, heaps.” Her eyes shone. “You won’t be sorry. Whatever may\r\nhappen you’ll not be dragged into it.\r\n\r\n“And,” she added after a pause, “there’s nothing really wrong about it,\r\nI’m a loyal American citizen, too loyal perhaps, but you see, my father\r\nwas in the World War, Grandfather at Manila Bay, and all that.”\r\n\r\n“My father died in France,” the large, dark-eyed girl said simply. “I\r\nwas too young to recall him.”\r\n\r\n“That was really tough. I’ve had a lot of fun with my dad.\r\n\r\n“But excuse me.” Once again Sally’s fingers gripped a knob and the\r\nmysterious radio set up a new sort of hum. With a headset clamped over\r\nher ears, she listened intently, then said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n“Hello. Nancy! Are you there?”\r\n\r\nAgain she listened, then laughed low.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Nancy,” she apologized, speaking through a small mouthpiece.\r\n“Something terribly exciting happened. I got something on the shortest\r\nwave-length, where nothing’s supposed to be.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did!” she exclaimed. Then: “No! It can’t be! Fifteen minutes.\r\nOh, boy! I’ll have to step on it. I—I’ll be right down. Meet you at the\r\nfoot of the ladder.”\r\n\r\n“What ladder?” the big girl asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n“The one from first floor to second, of course. We don’t have stairways\r\nin this place, you know, only ladders.” Sally laughed low.\r\n\r\nAfter turning off the switches, Sally snapped the black box shut, then\r\nhid it in a dark corner of the closet.\r\n\r\n“But I just came up a stairway,” the new girl insisted.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no you didn’t!” Sally laughed. “It was a ladder!”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\n“You’re new here so you’ll have to work that one out. I’m sure you’ll\r\nfind I’m right.” Sally was hastily putting on hat, coat, and gloves.\r\n“I’ve got to skip. Have my personal interview in fifteen minutes. That’s\r\nwhere they try to find out what we’re good for. What’s your specialty?\r\nOh, yes, and what’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“I’m Barbara Brown. And I’m scared to death for fear they’ll send me\r\nhome. I haven’t done a thing but sew, and work in a laundry, and cook a\r\nlittle.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll find a place for you. Just tell them your life story. Don’t be\r\nafraid. You’ll win.”\r\n\r\nSally was out of the room and down the “ladder” before Barbara could\r\nhave counted ten.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the “ladder” she met Nancy McBride, a girl she had known\r\nwell in the half-forgotten days of high-school basketball.\r\n\r\n“It’s perfectly terrible starting out in a new place with a deep\r\nsecret,” Sally said in a low tone as they hurried away toward the\r\n“U.S.S. Mary Sacks” where interviews for all recent recruits were\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” Nancy agreed soberly. “A trifle wacky if you’d ask me.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s so very important,” Sally insisted.\r\n\r\n“More important than making good with the WAVES?” Nancy asked soberly.\r\n“For my part I can’t think of a thing in the world that could be half as\r\nimportant as that. That’s just how I feel about it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s right. Oh! If I were thrown out of the WAVES I’d just want\r\nto die.” Sally’s face took on a tragic look. “And yet—”\r\n\r\n“And yet, what?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you just don’t know old C. K. Kennedy, that’s all. I’ve been\r\nworking with him since I was fifteen and now I’m twenty-one.”\r\n\r\n“Working at radio? What did you know about radio when you were fifteen?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it. I didn’t know a thing. You see, a radio came dropping\r\nright out of the sky and—”\r\n\r\n“Out of the sky?” Nancy stared.\r\n\r\n“Yes, right into the middle of a meadow where I was looking for a\r\nmeadowlark’s nest.”\r\n\r\n“Say! Why don’t you talk sense? You can’t expect people—”\r\n\r\n“Shush,” Sally whispered. “Here’s the gangplank of the 'U.S.S. Mary\r\nSacks.’ We’ll have to get right in. Don’t betray me. I’ll explain it all\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\nAs they entered, a girl in the nobby blue uniform of a WAVE said:\r\n\r\n“Take the ladder to Deck Two. Turn to the right and there you are.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Sally said to Nancy, with a sharp intake of breath, “there we\r\nare. Right in the midst of things. Some sharp-eyed examiner will probe\r\nour minds to find out how much we know, how keen we are, what our\r\nmotives for joining up were, and—”\r\n\r\n“And then she’ll start deciding what we can do best,” Nancy broke in.\r\n\r\n“And if she decides I’ll make a good secretary to an Admiral,” Sally\r\nsighed, “I’ll wish I hadn’t come. Well—” She took a long breath. “Here\r\nwe go up Fortune’s ladder. Wish you luck.”\r\n\r\n“Same to you.” Then up they went.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the big girl, Barbara, opened her bag, shook out her\r\nclothes, packed some away in a drawer, hung others up, then dropped into\r\na chair for a few long, long thoughts. The truth was at that moment she\r\nwished she hadn’t come.\r\n\r\nShe thought of the steam laundry where she had worked for three years.\r\nAll the girls laughing and talking, the fine clean smell of sheets as\r\nthey ran through the mangle, the rattle and clank of machines and the\r\nslap of flat-irons—it all came to her with a rush.\r\n\r\n“It’s all so strange here—” she whispered. “Go down the ladder, that’s\r\nwhat she said. What ladder, I wonder?”\r\n\r\nThen she jumped up. She would have to get out of here, begin to face\r\nthings. What things? Just any things. If you faced them, they lost their\r\nterror. They stepped to one side and let you by.\r\n\r\nAfter putting on her hat and coat, she opened the door to stand there\r\nfor a moment. Truth was, she was looking for the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Hi, there!” came in a cheery voice as a girl in a natty blue suit and\r\njaunty hat rounded a corner in the hall. “You’re one of the new ones,\r\naren’t you? Close the hatch and let’s get down the ladder for a coke at\r\nthe USO.”\r\n\r\n“The ha-hatch?” Barbara faltered. “What’s a hatch and where’s the\r\nladder?”\r\n\r\n“Right down—oh!” the girl in blue broke off. “I forgot. Of course you\r\nwouldn’t know. You see, we are WAVES, you and I—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I—”\r\n\r\n“So this place we live in is a ship, at least we say it is. This is not\r\nthe second floor but the second deck. The door is a hatch, the walls\r\nbulkheads and, of course, the stairway is a ladder.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Barbara beamed. “That’s the way it is!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course Sally and Nancy had not boarded a ship for their interview.\r\nThe “U.S.S. Mary Sacks” was a two story building turned over by the\r\ncollege to the WAVES. And it was up a stairs, not a real ladder, that\r\nthe two girls climbed. It was all a part of the program that was to turn\r\ngirls from all walks of life into sailors.\r\n\r\n“Your name is Sally Scott?” said a girl in a WAVES uniform.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Sally.\r\n\r\n“Come into my parlor,” the girl said, smiling, broadly and indicating a\r\nsmall booth furnished with two chairs and a narrow table.\r\n\r\n“‘Said the spider to the fly.’” Sally returned the smile as she finished\r\nthe quotation..\r\n\r\n“Oh! It’s not nearly as bad as that,” said the blonde examiner. “The fly\r\ndid not escape. You will, I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“Six months after the war is over.” Sally did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that sounds a bit serious, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It certainly does,” Sally agreed.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to have a sense of humor and also a serious side,” said the\r\nexaminer. “We like them that way. You should get on well.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. I’m glad you think so.”\r\n\r\n“My name is Marjory Mills. I won’t keep you long, at least not longer\r\nthan you wish to stay.” Ensign Mills motioned Sally to a chair.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” she said as she dropped into the opposite chair, “why did\r\nyou want to join the WAVES?”\r\n\r\n“It’s our war. We’re all in it. I hate the way the people of France,\r\nBelgium, and all the rest are treated. They’re slaves. They’ve got to be\r\nfreed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve three cousins in the war. We were great pals. All the boys of our\r\ncrowd are gone, and some of the girls.”\r\n\r\n“Lonesome? Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“No, not entirely. I want them to come back, never wanted anything quite\r\nso much. They can’t come back until we’ve done all we can to help them.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” Ensign Mills spoke quietly. “You’re sure that it wasn’t\r\nromance, love of excitement, the desire to go places and see things that\r\nbrought you here?”\r\n\r\nSally looked into the other girl’s eyes, then said:\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course it was, in part. No one motive ever draws us into making\r\na great decision, at least not often. Of course I dream of romance,\r\nadventure, and travel. Who doesn’t?”\r\n\r\n“We all do,” Marjory Mills agreed frankly. “The only thing is, those\r\ncan’t be our main motives. If they were we should meet disappointment\r\nand perhaps miserably fail. ‘Blood, sweat, and tears.’ That is what we\r\nhave ahead of us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Sally replied soberly. “I know. My father has told me. He was in\r\nFrance for more than a year.”\r\n\r\n“In the last war? Yes, then you would know. We like to have daughters of\r\nveterans. Some of them are among our best. And now,” Marjory Mills’s\r\nvoice was brisk again. “What do you think you’d like to do? Or, first,\r\nwould you like to tell me your story?”\r\n\r\n“I’d love to. How much time have I?” Sally looked at her watch.\r\n\r\n“As much as you like.” Ensign Mills settled back in her chair. “Shoot!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n                         THE RADIO FROM THE SKY\r\n\r\n\r\n“I grew up, as every child must,” Sally began. “Until I was fifteen we\r\nweren’t rich, not terribly poor either so—”\r\n\r\n“Middle class,” the examiner murmured. “Best people in the world.”\r\n\r\n“And then something happened,” Sally announced.\r\n\r\n“What was that?”\r\n\r\n“I was in a meadow looking for a meadowlark’s nest when a radio fell\r\nfrom the sky.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t by any chance be kidding me—” Marjory Mills’s eyes opened\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n“No—” Sally sat up straight. “No, I wouldn’t. It wasn’t a big radio,\r\nonly a tiny one.”\r\n\r\n“How far did it fall?”\r\n\r\n“About seventy thousand feet.”\r\n\r\n“Only about fourteen miles. Not much of a tumble after all.” Once again\r\nMarjory Mills’s eyes were wide.\r\n\r\n“It didn’t hit the ground very hard. It wasn’t broken.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ensign Mills Interviewed Sally]\r\n\r\n“No, I suppose not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it wasn’t.” Sally talked rapidly. “It was attached to what was\r\nleft of a large, paper balloon. As it went up, taking the radio with it,\r\nthe balloon expanded. It got larger and larger. At seventy thousand feet\r\nthe balloon burst and the radio came down.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Marjory Mills.\r\n\r\n“No—you don’t see. At least, I’m quite sure you don’t.” Sally half\r\napologized. “The radio had been sent up by a very nice old man who\r\nwanted to know about the weather. As it went up, the radio, a sending\r\nset, broadcast certain information about the weather. Don’t ask me how\r\nbecause I don’t know all about that. All I knew at the time was that\r\nattached to the radio was a card and on the card was written: ‘If the\r\nfinder of this radio will return it to C. K. Kennedy at Ferndale he will\r\nreceive a five dollar reward!’”\r\n\r\n“And you needed a new spring dress, so you returned the radio.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! How did you ever guess that?” They joined in a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n“But I’m not joking.” Sally’s face sobered. “It’s every bit true.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” was the quick response. “Tell me the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, that nice old man, C. K. Kennedy, had lived in my own\r\ntown for three years and I’d never heard of him. He owned a tiny house\r\ndown by the river. Back of the house was his shop, where he invented\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Then he was an inventor!”\r\n\r\n“Sure he is! When I brought him the radio I asked him why he sent it up\r\ninto the sky. He told me all about it, how he could learn all sorts of\r\nthings about how cold it would be, when it would rain, and all that just\r\nby sending up radios to listen in for him.\r\n\r\n“That’s the way it started.” Sally heaved a sigh. “Old C. K.—everyone\r\ncalled him that and I never knew his first name—he was so kind and told\r\nme so much that I went back again, lots of times.\r\n\r\n“By and by I started helping him. Just doing little things. I told\r\npeople how good he was with radios and they started bringing them to be\r\nfixed. We came to have quite a business. As soon as high school was over\r\nI worked there all the time.”\r\n\r\n“You must have made quite a lot of money.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, not so much. You see,” Sally leaned forward, “we were like some\r\nvery fine surgeons. We charged what people could afford to pay.”\r\n\r\n“I see.”\r\n\r\n“And there are lots more poor people than rich ones.”\r\n\r\n“Always.”\r\n\r\n“When a little lame boy came in with a very cheap radio that got the\r\nstations all jumbled up, we put in more transformers and tubes,\r\npractically made a new radio out of it. Then it worked fine.”\r\n\r\n“And then you charged him—”\r\n\r\n“Just a dollar.”\r\n\r\n“But when a rich man brought you his big fussy radio that would get\r\nBerlin, Tokio, London, and maybe Mars, you charged him—”\r\n\r\n“Plenty!” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your old C. K. must have been a fine man, but what about the\r\ninventions?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that—” Sally frowned. “He’s such a sensitive old man, C. K. is. We\r\ninvented something quite wonderful—that is, _he_ did. That was quite a\r\nwhile ago. I didn’t know much about it but we could ride about at night\r\nin his rattly old car, and every now and then he’d stop and say: ‘See!\r\nSome young fellow off there is operating a sending radio.’ We could have\r\ndriven right up to his door if we wanted to, but we never did.”\r\n\r\n“It was a radio-spotter!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and C. K. said it was the best one ever made.”\r\n\r\n“What came of it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. You see, C. K. was very fond of his country. He thought Uncle\r\nSam should have his invention. So Mother and I fixed him up the best we\r\ncould—he just wasn’t interested in clothes—and we sent him off to\r\nWashington. And,” Sally sighed deeply, “he just couldn’t stand waiting.\r\nThey kept him waiting three days. Then, because he was old and a little\r\nbit shabby they thought he didn’t know much, so—”\r\n\r\n“So nothing came of it?”\r\n\r\n“Just nothing. C. K. came back discouraged and downhearted, but pretty\r\nsoon we were working as hard as ever. And now,” Sally’s eyes shone, “you\r\njust ought to see—”\r\n\r\nThe light in Sally’s eyes faded. Just in time she caught herself. She\r\nhad been about to betray the secret of the black box up there in her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“I—I can’t tell you,” she apologized. “I just must not. It’s his\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. That’s all right,” Marjory Mills agreed. “That really\r\ndoesn’t matter. The only thing that matters just now is, how do you fit\r\nin with the WAVES?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes—that’s it.” Sally leaned forward, eager and alert.\r\n\r\n“I’ll just go down our little list,” Marjory Mills smiled. “You can tell\r\nme which category you’d like to try for the sixty-four dollar question.\r\nNow, listen carefully and tell me when to stop. Here they are:\r\nSecretarial Work, Typing, Bookkeeping, Aviation Ground Work, Parachute\r\nRigging, Operating a Link Trainer—” To all this Sally shook her head.\r\nBut when the examiner read, “Communication, including radio,” she sat up\r\nwith a start to exclaim:\r\n\r\n“That’s it!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Marjory Mills agreed. “That, beyond a doubt, is it. Ultimately\r\nyou’ll go to a special school for perfecting your training. You’ll need\r\nto know about sending and receiving in code, blinker signaling, flag\r\nsignaling, and a lot more.\r\n\r\n“But first,” she settled back in her chair, “you’ll have to stay right\r\nhere in Mt. Morris College, learning; for the most part, things that\r\nhave nothing to do with communication.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, must I?” Sally cried in sudden dismay.\r\n\r\n“You’ll love it.” Marjory Mills’s words carried conviction. “When it’s\r\nall over you’ll agree, I’m sure, that we’ve made a real sailor out of\r\nyou and that you would not have missed it for anything.”\r\n\r\n“And after that, special school?” Sally asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“After that perhaps you’ll find yourself in an airplane directing tower,\r\nsaying to the pilots of great Flying Fortresses: ‘Come in, forty-three.\r\nAll right, sixty-four, you’re off’, and things like that. Thrilling,\r\nwhat?”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful, and after that perhaps I’ll be on some small airplane\r\ncarrier in a convoy crossing the Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, just perhaps. There is a law before Congress now which, if passed,\r\nwill permit us to send WAVES on sea voyages and to service overseas. The\r\nWACS are already there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Congress must pass that law.” Sally half rose in her chair. Again\r\nshe was thinking of her secret in the black box. “They just must pass\r\nthat law.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t hope too much,” the examiner warned. “‘Ours not to reason why—’”\r\n\r\n“‘Ours but to do or die’,” Sally finished in a whisper.\r\n\r\nAnd so her interview came to an end.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Nancy McBride was going through her examination with\r\nmuch the same result. She too was a radio bug. She and her lame brother\r\nhad been radio hams since she was a dozen years old. Though she had\r\nlived in another small city, she and Sally had been good friends for\r\nsome time. That was why Sally had dared trust her with C. K.’s secret\r\nand one of her much treasured black boxes.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she had exclaimed on seeing Nancy on the train that carried her to\r\nMt. Morris and her new home. “You’re really going to be a WAVE!”\r\n\r\n“Surest thing!” Nancy had thrown her arms about her. “And you, too!”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” Sally agreed. “Oh, boy!” she had whispered when they had\r\nfound a seat together. “Do you take the load off my mind!”\r\n\r\n“Why? How come?” Nancy demanded in great surprise.\r\n\r\n“Shush, it’s a secret.” Sally’s voice dropped to a whisper. “It’s a deep\r\nsecret. You know old C. K.?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course. He’s given Bob—that’s my brother, you know—and me a\r\nlot of fine suggestions.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he and I have been working on something for weeks and weeks. It’s\r\na lot too deep for me, but it’s a radio that works with wave-lengths\r\nshorter than any that have been used yet. You know what that might\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I—I guess so. You could send messages to someone having the same\r\nsort of radio and no one else could hear them.”\r\n\r\n“Not a soul.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful! Did you get it worked out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, only a few days before I was to leave, I took one portable radio\r\nto a place twenty miles away and talked to C. K. back there in his shop.\r\nWe could hear each other plainly. That was a great day for C. K.”\r\n\r\n“And for you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but a greater one came when he took me into his shop that day\r\nbefore I left and said: ‘Sally, I want you to take these two black boxes\r\nwith you.’”\r\n\r\n“‘But, C. K.,’ I said, ‘those are your two secret, secret radios, your\r\nchoicest possessions!’\r\n\r\n“‘I can make more of them.’ That’s what he said. Then he went on, ‘Once\r\nI tried to give one of my inventions to our country. I failed and later\r\nsomeone stole it from me. Now, Sally, it’s your turn—’”\r\n\r\n“How strange!” Nancy whispered. “What did he mean?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I asked him,” Sally whispered excitedly. “He said I was to\r\ntake these radios with me, that I was to get someone who could be\r\ntrusted to help me and, as I found time, to test the radios, listen in\r\nfor any other radios that might be using those wave-lengths, do all I\r\ncould to see what could be accomplished with them to aid our country.”\r\n\r\n“That,” Nancy said, “is the strangest thing I ever heard.”\r\n\r\n“Not so strange after all,” Sally said soberly. “He knew I was going\r\nfirst to a school close to the sea where I might listen for messages.\r\nThen, too, I am to be a WAVE. Perhaps I shall travel in a convoy across\r\nthe sea. What a chance that will be to try out the radios!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, what a chance!”\r\n\r\n“Nancy,” Sally whispered tensely, “will you be the one who can be\r\ntrusted? Will you join me in testing C. K.’s radios?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I—” Nancy hesitated. “Yes! Yes, I will. You are my friend. C. K.\r\nis my friend. I also love America, and want to help, so why not?”\r\n\r\nAnd that is how it came about that, as they walked slowly back to their\r\nstaterooms on a ship that was a ship in name only, Sally and Nancy\r\ntalked of radio and of the day when they would be full-fledged WAVES\r\nserving their country.\r\n\r\n“And here’s hoping they put us on an honest-to-goodness ship!” Sally\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Here’s hoping,” Nancy echoed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n                           A MESSAGE IN CODE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, with a worried look still on her face, Barbara sat at a\r\nsmall table drinking hot chocolate while her companion, in the chic blue\r\nWAVES suit, enjoyed a coke.\r\n\r\n“Hot chocolate will make you fat,” said Belle Mason, Barbara’s new\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“I’m fat already,” Barbara smiled. “An even hundred and fifty.”\r\n\r\n“You’re big, not fat,” her companion corrected. “That’s not a bad weight\r\nat all for your height. What are you to do for the WAVES?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it.” Barbara’s frown deepened. “I don’t know much about\r\nanything but cooking, housework, and laundry.”\r\n\r\n“Home laundry?”\r\n\r\n“No, steam laundry. I know you’ll think I was silly, but just out of\r\nhigh-school I went into a laundry to work. I’ve never done anything\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“You liked it, of course, or you wouldn’t have stayed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I like the nice, clean smell of the shiny white sheets and pillow\r\ncases, and the cozy, warm feeling of everything. I like to run the\r\nsheets through the mangle, fold them just right, then run them through\r\nagain. I like to stack them up, just right, in clean white piles.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I guess I’m hopeless,” Barbara sighed. “Just an old hag of a\r\nlaundry worker. What can the WAVES do with a creature like that?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be just wonderful!” her companion beamed.\r\n\r\n“Won-wonderful!” Barbara stared.\r\n\r\n“Sure! They’ll make a parachute rigger out of you.”\r\n\r\n“Parachute rigger? What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“You know that all fighting airmen wear parachutes, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course!”\r\n\r\n“And that those parachutes often save their lives, in fact, have already\r\nsaved thousands of lives?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but—”\r\n\r\n“Parachutes don’t just grow on trees like walnuts. They have to be made\r\nwith great care and arranged with greater care. The rigger is the one\r\nwho packs them into their bags.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’d love that!”\r\n\r\n“Sure you would. And it’s a tremendously important job. One slip is all\r\nit takes. If a parachute is folded wrong, some fine fellow comes\r\nshooting down, down, thousands of feet to his death. But you—you love\r\nto do things just right, even bed sheets.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll be the best there is. Good parachute riggers are hard to\r\nget. Of course,” Belle went on, “you don’t just fold parachutes and pack\r\nthem. You select large ones for large people.”\r\n\r\n“And small ones for small people!”\r\n\r\n“Sure! In some of them you pack iron rations, food for a day or so. In\r\nothers you’ll put light pneumatic rubber rafts and fishing line—that’s\r\nin case the flier might land in the sea.\r\n\r\n“Then, of course, there are paper balloons to be rigged for dropping\r\nfood and medicine, and small silk ones for dogs.”\r\n\r\n“Dogs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course, the dogs of war.”\r\n\r\n“Real dogs?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! Dogs have played an important part in all wars. They carry\r\nmessages, keep the night watches, and warn their masters of approaching\r\nenemies. Yes, they have their parachutes, and many of them beg to have\r\ntheir chutes strapped on.”\r\n\r\n“Do they really like dropping from the sky?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t they, though? And that reminds me. I don’t want to frighten\r\nyou but, because of the great importance of their work, and so they will\r\nrealize to the full just how important it is, there is talk of having\r\neach parachute rigger make at least one parachute landing.”\r\n\r\n“What! You mean—” Barbara appeared to shrink up in her chair. “You mean\r\nI’ll have to drop from way up in the sky?”\r\n\r\n“You might be asked to.”\r\n\r\n“I’d die.” Barbara’s face paled.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no you wouldn’t. Thousands are doing it every day.”\r\n\r\n“I’m so big, I’d go right on down into the earth.” Barbara laughed,\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Parachutes are made to fit their owners. Some are made for\r\ndropping five hundred pound antiaircraft guns. But don’t let that worry\r\nyou,” Belle hastened to add. “You may never be asked to jump.\r\n‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ I didn’t think that up,\r\nbut it’s good all the same.”\r\n\r\n“One thing still worries me—” Barbara said a moment later.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“My interview. My roommate just went to take hers.”\r\n\r\n“You may forget that.” Belle smiled an odd smile. “You’ve practically\r\nhad yours already.”\r\n\r\n“I? Had mine?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: You Mean I’ll Have To Drop From the Sky?]\r\n\r\n“Sure. I’m one of the examiners. This is my hour off. When your time\r\ncomes, just ask to be examined by Ensign Belle Mason. We’ll get it over\r\nwith in a jiffy.\r\n\r\n“And now—” Belle stood up. “I must get back to my post and help solve\r\nother cases that are really difficult. It’s nice to have had a talk with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It—it’s been wonderful.” Then Belle Mason was gone.\r\n\r\nThat evening after they had eaten their dinner in an attractive college\r\ndining room, the two girls, Sally and Barbara, walked slowly back to\r\ntheir room.\r\n\r\nAlready Sally was beginning to know what her examiner had meant when she\r\nsaid, speaking of the life at Mt. Morris, “You’ll love it.”\r\n\r\nSally had never even dreamed of a college education. There was not\r\nnearly enough money for that, but now here she was a student in a real\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n“It’s quite an old college, isn’t it?” Barbara said.\r\n\r\n“One of the oldest in New England,” Sally agreed. “And one of the most\r\nbeautiful. See how the sun shines through those great, old elms.”\r\n\r\n“And how the ivy clings to the red brick walls. It’s wonderful. I could\r\nalmost forgive the war, just because it’s given us a new sort of life.\r\nBut, oh, gee!” Barbara exclaimed. “Just, think of having to drop from\r\nway up there in the sky!”\r\n\r\n“Who said we had to?” Sally demanded sharply.\r\n\r\n“Not all of us, just me, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nBarbara told her of the impromptu interview.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you have to go up, I’ll go with you,” Sally declared.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“Why not? If I’m to work with radio, I may be sent up as a radioman for\r\na bomber. Then I’ll want to know just how to step out into thin air.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” Barbara exclaimed. “It’s a date. If I step through a hole\r\nin the sky, you’re to come stepping right after me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a date,” Sally agreed.\r\n\r\nThat evening Barbara went to a movie with one of the girls who had come\r\nin on the same train. Left to herself, Sally sat for a long time in her\r\ndark room just thinking.\r\n\r\nThose were long, long thoughts. She had been there long enough to\r\nrealize as never before what a change was to come into her life.\r\n\r\n“I’m in for the duration,” she thought with a thrill and a shudder. How\r\nlong would the duration be? No one knew that. One thing was sure. Life,\r\nall kinds of life, grows broader.\r\n\r\n“It’s like a river on its way to the sea,” she thought. The life of the\r\nWAVES was sure to be like that. Just now they were not asked to go\r\noutside the United States. How long would this last? Not long, perhaps.\r\n\r\n“I almost hope it won’t,” she told, herself. And yet she shuddered\r\nafresh at the thought of life aboard a transport or a destroyer with\r\nwolf-packs of enemy subs haunting the black waters.\r\n\r\n“But there’s C. K.’s radio,” she told herself. “A sea trip would give me\r\na grand chance to try it out.”\r\n\r\nThat this radio was a marvelous invention she did not doubt, yet the\r\nmodest, over-careful old man had forbidden her to mention it to a single\r\nperson who might be interested in its use and promotion.\r\n\r\n“I may discover flaws in it,” had been his word. “There is always plenty\r\nof time. You just take these two sets and try them out, test them in\r\nevery way you can. Then let me know what you discover.”\r\n\r\n“‘Let me know what you discover,’” she whispered. She had made a\r\ndiscovery of a sort, that very afternoon. Something very like a radio\r\nmessage in code had come in on her secret wave length, where it was\r\nthought no messages had ever been sent.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try it again,” she told herself. Springing to her feet, she\r\ndragged the black box from its hiding place.\r\n\r\nWith the lights still off, she turned on a switch to watch the many\r\ntubes glow red. After twisting two dials and adjusting one of them very\r\ncarefully, she listened intently and, after a moment’s wait, was\r\nthrilled once again by the low “put—put—put (wait) put—put (wait)\r\nput—put—put” again.\r\n\r\nAfter turning a dial half around, she listened again. The sound came,\r\nbut this time very faintly.\r\n\r\nYes, even as she listened, there came another “put—put—put.” It was\r\nlouder and of a different quality of sound.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she breathed. “Two of you!”\r\n\r\nSo she worked for an hour. At the end of that hour she knew there were\r\nfour “put-puts” out there somewhere. Were they radios of American\r\nplanes, enemy subs, or ships of our allies? She had no way of knowing.\r\n\r\nSnapping off two switches, she turned on a third. After ten seconds of\r\nwaiting she whispered into her mouthpiece:\r\n\r\n“I’m alone. Come on down, can you?”\r\n\r\nAfter that she whispered: “That’s swell!”\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Nancy came tiptoeing into the dark room.\r\n\r\n“What’s the meaning of all this darkness and secrecy?” she whispered\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n“It’s for effect,” Sally laughed. “Close the hatch softly and sit down\r\nhere beside me on the deck. I’ve something for you to hear.”\r\n\r\nSally turned on the radio. Then as the “put-put” began, she turned the\r\ndial to catch the different grades of sound.\r\n\r\n“That’s someone broadcasting in code,” she declared.\r\n\r\n“Sounds more like a mouse chewing a board,” Nancy laughed.\r\n\r\n“All the same, it’s code of some sort.” Sally insisted. “And I’m going\r\nto figure it out. Trouble is, it comes in low and indistinct.”\r\n\r\n“An outside aerial would help, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one on top of this building.”\r\n\r\n“There is?” Sally exclaimed. “Then we’ll run a wire up to it. But how\r\nwill we get it up there without being seen?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s see.” Nancy counted up to six on her fingers. Then she slipped\r\nout through the door.\r\n\r\nShe was back almost at once with the good news that her room was\r\ndirectly over Sally’s. “We can run the wires along the heat pipes,” she\r\nexplained. “There’s even a pipe running from my room to the attic,\r\nthough I can’t see why.”\r\n\r\n“Even then we’ll not be on the roof,” Sally mourned.\r\n\r\n“There are two gable windows on each side of the attic,” Nancy said.\r\n“All you have to do is to get up to the attic. You can step right out on\r\nthe roof from a window.”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose you’re going to tell me you have a key to the door at the\r\nfoot of the attic stairway?” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“No, but I have quite a way with locks. I think it can be arranged,”\r\nsaid Nancy. “But, Sally,” she protested. “You’d think we were sweet\r\nsixteen and in a boarding school instead of grown young ladies sworn in\r\nto serve America—”\r\n\r\n“We’ll serve America in a big way,” Sally insisted stoutly, “if only we\r\nget this secret short wave doing its bit. You just wait and see! And I’m\r\ngoing to get my connection with that aerial on the roof sooner than\r\nsoon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n                        DANNY DUKE MAKES A CATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days that followed were busy ones. There were shots for typhoid,\r\nsmallpox and all the rest, with many a sore arm.\r\n\r\nThey marched until their legs ached and their feet were sore, but all\r\nthe time their officers were so kind and all their companions so\r\nfriendly that it did not seem to matter.\r\n\r\nLong hours were filled with classes. They learned history of the Navy\r\nfrom the beginning, a glorious story of which they could all be proud.\r\nNavy customs came in for their full share of discussion.\r\n\r\n“Boy, am I glad I am getting this first!” Sally exclaimed one day.\r\n“Without it I’d be completely lost aboard a ship.”\r\n\r\n“But we’re not sailing on a ship, at least not the way things stand\r\nnow,” said Nancy.\r\n\r\n“All the same we’re going in for Communications and you can’t\r\ncommunicate with anyone unless you speak his language,” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got something there,” Nancy agreed.\r\n\r\nAs for Barbara, besides her regular assigned work, she was taken to an\r\nairfield where paratroopers were being trained.\r\n\r\nAs she watched ten boys, one by one, slip from a captive balloon\r\nhundreds of feet in the sky, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh! I could never do that!”\r\n\r\nWhen she saw the parachutes, white against a blue sky, come drifting\r\ndown and watched the boys drop to the ground as if they were dead, then\r\nspring up laughing, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“That’s wonderful! I’ll do anything, just anything to have a part in\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nFor a time the two black boxes were neglected. Then, one night, they\r\ncame back with a bang. That was the night following the receipt of a\r\nletter from Sally’s old friend, C. K. It ran:\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sally: Received yours of the 17th. Note what you say about the\r\n  black boxes.\r\n\r\n  “Your recent discovery may be of the greatest importance. I refer to\r\n  the disturbances you think may be messages in code. On that\r\n  wave-length it can hardly be anything else. Keep it up. You may make\r\n  a startling discovery. I have definite theory regarding those\r\n  supposed messages, but will not tell you about it until you have\r\n  further details.\r\n\r\n  “You don’t know how to receive in code, do you? It’s not difficult.\r\n  Get someone there to teach you.\r\n\r\n  “I agree with you that an outside aerial will help bring out the\r\n  sounds. But don’t take too many chances just to make an old man’s\r\n  dream come true.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours for success,\r\n                                                                C. K.”\r\n\r\n“Too many chances!” Sally exploded after reading the letter. “There\r\ncouldn’t possibly be too many chances.”\r\n\r\nThat very night she started taking the chances.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy, windy night. “Just the night for a murder,” Sally\r\nwhispered to Nancy as they embarked on their enterprise.\r\n\r\n“Or something,” Nancy agreed.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday. All the WAVES have Saturday afternoon and night off for\r\nshore leave. Most of them would be away so there would be few prying\r\neyes. That was why they had picked on this night for connecting the\r\nblack boxes with the aerial set up on the roof.\r\n\r\nThe wires running from Sally’s room up to Nancy’s and to the attic were\r\nin place. The lock to the attic door was old. Nancy had solved that with\r\na skeleton key bought at the five and ten.\r\n\r\n“There’s no counting of noses at bedcheck tonight,” Sally said. “So\r\nwe’ll start work at ten. You can be the lookout and I’ll do the work.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget you’re going to be quite a way up in the air,” Nancy\r\ncautioned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ve always been a tomboy.” Sally did a cartwheel. “I’ll put on\r\ngray slacks and a gray sweater, just in case the moon comes out. The\r\nroof is gray, you know.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better wear sneakers.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure!”\r\n\r\nAnd so everything was set for the hour of ten.\r\n\r\n“All clear!” Nancy whispered, tiptoeing down the hall. “Deck Three is\r\ndeserted. Come on up.”\r\n\r\nArmed with two pairs of small pliers, a coil of wire, a flashlight and\r\nthe key to the attic, Sally followed in silence to the floor above. A\r\nswift glide, the rattle of a key, the silent opening and shutting of a\r\ndoor and Sally found herself tiptoeing up the attic stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark and gloomy spot, that attic. As Nancy had put it: “A\r\nhundred years look at you up there.”\r\n\r\nThis was true, for an accumulation of furniture, long outmoded, was\r\nstored there. There, too, were all manner of stage drops and settings\r\nleft over from amateur plays. With her flashlight aimed low, Sally\r\npicked her way with care to the nearest gable window.\r\n\r\nThe window was nailed down but her pliers soon took care of that.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped out on the roof, clinging to the gable, she took one good\r\nlook at the world beneath and above her, then shuddered.\r\n\r\nWith dark clouds rolling through a black, windy sky it was one of those\r\nnights that always seemed to depress Sally.\r\n\r\nShaking herself free from her moodiness, she gave close attention to the\r\nproblem that lay before her.\r\n\r\nTo discover the end of a wire they had thrust up along the heat pipe and\r\nto attach the end of her coil to it was simple enough. From there it was\r\nto be a trifle difficult. The roof was not too steep but shingles do not\r\noffer much chance for a hand grip. As Nancy had said, it was quite a\r\ndistance to the ground from there and, though she would not have\r\nadmitted it for worlds, Sally found herself a little dizzy.\r\n\r\nOne fact gave her a little comfort. Just beneath the part of the roof\r\nwhere she must do her climbing was an elm tree. Its top was broad and\r\nits strong, flexible branches all but brushed the building.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there hesitating, a group of freshman boys came marching\r\nby, singing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She Stepped Out on the Roof and Clung to the Gable]\r\n\r\nFlattening herself against the gray roof she waited for them to pass.\r\nThen, having steeled herself for her task, she thrust her tools into her\r\npockets, held the loose end of the wire in her teeth and began to climb.\r\nClutching with her hands and pushing with her feet, she crept upward.\r\nShe made slow progress. Now the ridge seemed not so far away. She dared\r\nnot look back or down.\r\n\r\nShe was halfway up, when, with startling suddenness, the moon came from\r\nbehind a cloud.\r\n\r\n“Gosh!” she exclaimed, flattening herself against the shingles. She went\r\nso flat that she started slowly to slide. After digging in with toes and\r\nfingers she managed to hold her ground. And then the moon hid its face.\r\n\r\nOne more desperate struggle and she found herself sitting triumphantly\r\nastride the ridge.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she breathed, “all I have to do is to pull the wire tight, attach\r\nit to the aerial and then slide down.”\r\n\r\nYes, that was all there was to it, just to slide down.\r\n\r\nWith fingers that trembled slightly she drew the gray wire tight against\r\nthe roof, cut it at the right place and then, with the skill of a\r\nlineman, wound it tight, round and round the original wire leading to\r\nthe aerial.\r\n\r\nShe had twisted herself back to a place astride the roof when again the\r\nmoon showed its face.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant she thought she heard someone far below let out a\r\nlow whistle. She couldn’t let herself be seen sitting there, just\r\ncouldn’t. That might mean catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThen it happened. In attempting to throw herself flat, she overdid the\r\nmatter. Missing a grip on the ridge, she heard her flashlight go rolling\r\ndown the roof. And, in quite an involuntary manner, she came gliding,\r\nclawing and kicking after it.\r\n\r\nRecalling the tree and at the same time realizing that she was powerless\r\nto check her slow glide, she managed somehow to swing half about. When\r\nshe left the roof, she rolled off, felt the brush of a leafy branch,\r\nstruck out desperately with her hands, gripped a branch, clung there and\r\nfound herself at last dangling in mid-air. Or was she two-thirds of the\r\nway down? There was no way of knowing.\r\n\r\nClinging desperately to the cracking branch, she dared not call for\r\nhelp. What was to be done? Feeling a larger branch against her back, she\r\ntried to turn about. She had made half the swing just as her slender\r\nbranch gave an ominous crack.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a voice from below said: “Come on down, sister. I’ll\r\ncatch you.”\r\n\r\n“Good grief!” she thought. “It’s a man.” And then the branch broke.\r\n\r\nShe landed rather solidly in a pair of strong arms. Then her feet hit\r\nthe ground. Also the moon came out.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing up there?” The man held her, as if she were a sack\r\nof wheat that might fall over.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight was on his face. He was young and wore a heavy blue coat.\r\nHis cap had been knocked off.\r\n\r\n“That,” she replied slowly, “is a military secret. But the way I came\r\ndown, it seems, is common knowledge.” She did not try to escape.\r\n\r\n“Rather uncommon knowledge, I’d say,” he drawled. “You might have broken\r\nyour neck.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, or been caught.”\r\n\r\n“You were that,” he chuckled. “And you’re not a bad catch, at that. This\r\nis a rather lonesome college for some folks. Tell me who you are and\r\nI’ll let you go.\r\n\r\n“I will anyway,” he said dropping his hands.\r\n\r\n“I’m Sally Scott and I’m a WAVE!” she confessed.\r\n\r\n“A WAVE! Then we belong to the same outfit. I’m a flying sailor. Shake!”\r\nHe put out a hand for a good handclasp.\r\n\r\n“Oh! A flying sailor!” she exclaimed. “Then you could teach me to\r\nreceive in code.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I could and will, in my spare time.”\r\n\r\n“We have an hour after supper.”\r\n\r\n“Suits me. But, say, now that I have you, how about a coke and a chat\r\nsomewhere?”\r\n\r\nShe did not reply at once. “We—we have to be careful. Mind taking my\r\npal along?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s a go. I—Oh, boy! Nancy will think I’m dead, or something!\r\nWait. I’ll be back.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll wait.”\r\n\r\nShe was gone.\r\n\r\n“Sally Scott! How did you get down that way?” Nancy exclaimed as Sally\r\ncame racing up the second story ladder, instead of coming down from the\r\nattic.\r\n\r\n“I—I found a new way to get down and, and I found a nice new boy,”\r\nSally panted. “He wants to buy us a coke. Come on, let’s go.”\r\n\r\n“Sally, you didn’t,” Nancy protested. “Besides, there’s a scratch on\r\nyour face. It’s bleeding.”\r\n\r\n“All right then, I didn’t.” Sally dabbed at her cheek. “You won’t\r\nbelieve me if I tell you the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Try me.”\r\n\r\n“All right then, after I got the wire all fixed. I fell off the roof,\r\nlanded in a tree and hung to a branch as long as I could and what do you\r\nthink?”\r\n\r\n“A nice boy caught you. And you expect me to believe that?”\r\n\r\n“All right, then don’t. Anyway the wire is up.”\r\n\r\n“And now we can get London, Paris, and Berlin. Come on. Let’s try.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Sally seized Nancy’s arm. “The nice boy is real. Come on, let’s\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t go looking like that?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll wash the blood off my face. We’ve got to get in uniform. Must wear\r\nthem even off duty, you know!”\r\n\r\nSo Sally was off to the washroom to bathe her cheek.\r\n\r\n“Now I ask you,” Nancy challenged the empty air, “how can they hope to\r\nmake a WAVE out of a girl like that?”\r\n\r\nSally was back in a minute and slipped into her uniform. Nancy was ready\r\na moment later and then they were down the stairs and out into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“This is Nancy McBride.” Sally introduced her companion to the flying\r\nsailor who had stepped out into the moonlight.\r\n\r\n“I’m pleased to meet you, Nancy. I’m Danny Duke,” he said. “Distant\r\nrelative of the famous Dukes, so distant that they never even sent me a\r\npackage of Duke’s mixture. Do you also walk in your sleep? And may I be\r\nlooking for you on the roof tops?”\r\n\r\n“Sally wasn’t walking in her sleep,” said Nancy, “but tell me, did she\r\nreally fall off the roof and did you catch her?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell her?” Danny turned to Sally.\r\n\r\n“Sure. Tell her. She wouldn’t believe me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Danny, in a mock-solemn voice, “it’s really true. I\r\nmade a real catch that time. But then, the elm helped out a lot.”\r\n\r\n“Good old elm!” Sally exclaimed. “I’ll never forget it! And now,” she\r\nadded, “I feel in need of reviving.”\r\n\r\nThe reviving came with good steaming cups of coffee.\r\n\r\nDanny Duke could stand the glare of a neon light, Sally found as she\r\nlooked at his strong, friendly face.\r\n\r\n“I’m just past twenty,” he told them with a touch of boyish pride. “And\r\nmy training is about finished right now.”\r\n\r\n“How is it you’re here so far from the Navy flying schools?” Nancy\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“I was back on some math, so they sent me here to brush up. I’ve about\r\ngot it now. Another two weeks will do it.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad,” Sally sighed. “But that will be time enough to teach me to\r\nreceive code, won’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure,” Danny grinned. “But say, are you the practical young miss!\r\nHere I save your life, and first thing you insist that I do something\r\nmore for you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not for me.” Leaning across the table Sally allowed her voice to\r\ndrop. “It’s much more important than that, I hope. It’s for our old\r\nfriend Uncle Sam. The things I did up there on the roof are part of it,\r\njust as my learning code will be. You are such a nice boy, I want you to\r\nhave a part in it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, thanks—” Danny was visibly embarrassed. “Thanks a lot: I’ll help\r\nall I can.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Danny was to have a much greater part in the\r\nundertaking than either he or Sally knew.\r\n\r\n“And now for one more try at the two black boxes,” Sally whispered\r\nexcitedly after the girls had said good-bye at the gangplank of their\r\nship that really wasn’t a ship at all.\r\n\r\n“It works! And it’s going to help a lot, that aerial is,” Sally\r\nexclaimed a few minutes later.\r\n\r\nThis was true. They were able now to catch the “put-put-put-put” of\r\nthose secret broadcasts sent from radios out somewhere on land or sea\r\nvery plainly. That night they stayed up till midnight, and were able to\r\nlocate seven different broadcasters.\r\n\r\n“They are all part of something big, I know that,” Sally insisted. “But\r\nis it a sub pack, a flight of planes, or a convoy of ships?”\r\n\r\n“Only time will tell,” was Nancy’s reply.\r\n\r\nJust then they caught the sound of voices in the hall and suddenly their\r\nsecret listenings to the great unknown were at an end. For if the secret\r\nradio were to remain just that, they must take great care not to expose\r\neither the black box or the purpose of their own midnight meetings. The\r\ntwo conspirators did not intend to be found out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n                         DANNY SHARES A SECRET\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a glorious hour at sunset in every day of work when Sally was\r\nfree to do as she chose. What she chose more often than not, in the days\r\nthat followed, was to visit a certain radio lab in one of the school’s\r\nregular buildings. Here she found Danny waiting to help her with her\r\nproblems. She discovered at once that he did know a very great deal\r\nabout communication and about radio in particular.\r\n\r\nWhen she complimented him on his knowledge he threw back his head and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“It’s no fault of mine,” he exclaimed. “I’ve had it drilled into me from\r\nthe very start. We’re in the Navy. Don’t forget that. Most of us will be\r\non aircraft carriers. That means we’ll be out over the sea in small\r\nplanes.”\r\n\r\n“Alone?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, sometimes not. You may have a radioman and may not. Anyway,\r\nhe may get killed. So you have to know all about radio, blinking lights,\r\nwaving flags, and a lot more.\r\n\r\n“Say!” he laughed. “I could propose to a good signal girl in ten\r\ndifferent ways.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till I get up on all the codes,” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. Well, then, let’s get busy.”\r\n\r\nHe picked up a booklet entitled, “International Code” and; turning to\r\npage twelve, said:\r\n\r\n“Morse code isn’t half bad. See! Here it is.” Sally looked over his\r\nshoulder. “A is dot, dash; B is dash, dot, dot dot, and so on down the\r\nline. You can learn all that in about no time. But receiving takes\r\nlonger. Those birds send out messages like greased lightning. You’ve got\r\nto think fast and be accurate at the same time. That’s tough. But it’s\r\nabsolutely necessary, especially in your work. To read a message wrong,\r\nskip a dot here and miss a dash there, may sink a ship, or even a half\r\ndozen ships.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Sally held her head. “That sounds serious!”\r\n\r\n“It is. But see here, why do we waste a beautiful sunset hour on code?\r\nYou’ll get that in your next school anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know, but I want it now. It,” she hesitated, “it’s not my secret\r\nalone so I can’t tell you too much.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to tell me anything,” he replied with a generous smile.\r\n\r\n“But I want to. That night when I fell off the roof I was running a wire\r\nfrom my room to the aerial on the roof. I’ve been working for a long\r\ntime with a dear old man who’s a real genius. He invented a special kind\r\nof radio and he gave me two of them to try out.”\r\n\r\n“I see. That’s what you’re doing now. Did the outside aerial help?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, a whole lot. The ‘put-puts’ come in a whole lot more\r\ndistinctly.”\r\n\r\n“The what?” He stared.\r\n\r\n“The ‘put-puts’. That’s what we call them. I suppose it’s some special\r\nform of code, but it’s not like any I’ve ever heard on the short wave\r\nsection of our radio.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you’d tried to write it down,” he said thoughtfully. “Perhaps\r\nthey have a secret code. They may substitute numbers for letters. See,\r\nhere are the numbers in Morse Code. Dot, dash, dash, dot are for one,\r\nfor two you add two dots and drop a dash-dot, dot, dash, dot. Three is\r\ndot, dot; dot, dash, dot, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t sound too hard,” interrupted Sally.\r\n\r\n“It’s simple. Take this book home and learn the numbers. Then listen to\r\nyour radio and try to write down the ‘put-puts’ in dots and dashes.”\r\n\r\n“I will if they are there tonight. Sometimes they’re not there at all\r\nand sometimes there are a lot of them, five, six, or a dozen, all\r\ntalking to one another like frogs in a pond.”\r\n\r\n“Is that right!” He suddenly became excited. “Say, perhaps they are in a\r\npond, the big pond. Perhaps they are wolves instead of frogs.”\r\n\r\n“Wolves?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, enemy subs, wolf-packs of them, you know. Wouldn’t that be a\r\nbreak?”\r\n\r\n“I—yes, I suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“You suppose so! Say! You don’t know the half of it! These wolf-packs\r\nare known to have some means of talking to one another under the water.”\r\n\r\n“They’d almost have to.”\r\n\r\n“Sure they would, but all the bright minds in Europe and America can’t\r\nfind out how they do it.\r\n\r\n“But then,” his voice dropped, “probably your ‘put-puts’ come from a\r\nflight of planes crossing to North Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Or from a convoy.”\r\n\r\n“Sure. We, too, have our secret methods of communication, but if your\r\nold friend has invented a new one, they’ll make him an admiral.”\r\n\r\n“It’s up to me to prove it. That’s why I’m so anxious about it.”\r\n\r\n“It is? Well, then, we’ll really dig in. Try out my code idea. Then\r\nwe’ll meet again at sunset tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a date.” She left the lab with a smile. Even if nothing came of\r\nthis code idea she had made a grand friend and that was always worth\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nLate that evening while others wrote letters, read or slept, Sally gave\r\nherself over once more to solving the riddle of the secret radio and its\r\n“put-puts.” She had made very little progress when the signal sounded\r\nfor lights out.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” she sighed. “No day is ever long enough.”\r\n\r\nShe had been in bed for a half hour but had not fallen asleep when\r\nsuddenly she caught a gleam of light from Barbara’s bed.\r\n\r\n“Barbara!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing?”\r\n\r\nThe light blinked out and Barbara’s head came out from beneath the\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry!” Barbara whispered back. “These studies are so hard and\r\nthere are so many of them I never get caught up. So I’ve been studying\r\nwith a flashlight under the covers. No one would know it but you.”\r\n\r\n“Such determination!” Sally exclaimed in a low voice. “You should have a\r\nmedal or something. But you’ll smother!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” Barbara laughed. “I’m like a seal. I come up for air.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway it’s an idea,” said Sally. Hopping out of bed, she gathered in\r\nher precious radio and, with a bed cover for a tent, studied the\r\n“put-puts” for another hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barbara’s Head Came Out From Beneath the Covers]\r\n\r\nThe close of that hour found her thoroughly disgusted. On a paper she\r\nhad made a few marks. When she had compared these to the code marks for\r\nletters and figures, they added up to exactly nothing.\r\n\r\n“Terrible,” she thought. “I know what I’ll do. I’ll take the radio over\r\nto the lab and show it to Danny. I’m sure he can be trusted. We’ll work\r\nthings out together.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“What’s that black box?” Danny asked, when she arrived next evening.\r\n\r\n“That’s my secret radio. I couldn’t do a thing last night. I want you to\r\nhelp me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s nice of you to trust me.” He beamed. “People have said I was\r\nsimple but could be trusted. Only time will tell.”\r\n\r\n“Time doesn’t need to tell me. I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you? Well, then that’s fine. How do you open this black box?”\r\n\r\nShe snapped it open. “Oh! We need an aerial!”\r\n\r\n“There’s one on this building, much better than the one you’ve been\r\nusing. There’s a connection over in the corner.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the radio was ready to operate. Sally turned the\r\nswitches. Nothing came out, not a sound.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” Danny asked.\r\n\r\n“Those gremlins, subs, or whatever they are, are not always there.”\r\n\r\n“Turn the dial. Get something else. That will tell us whether our\r\nconnections are okay.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing else on the air for us.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a queer radio.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is. But if we wait five minutes Station NANCY will be on the\r\nair.”\r\n\r\n“And in the meantime?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about parachutes,” she begged. “You’ve dropped a time or two,\r\nhaven’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. I’m a flier.”\r\n\r\n“How does it feel to drop for the first time?”\r\n\r\n“Just fine if you think of something else most, of the time. It helps to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n         “‘He’d fly through the air with the greatest of ease,\r\n         A daring young man on the flying trapeze.’\r\n\r\n“But why all the interest in parachutes?”\r\n\r\n“My roommate is going to be a parachute rigger.”\r\n\r\n“I hope she’s a careful sort of lady. I saw a boy drop two thousand feet\r\nstraight down. His rigger had failed him.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll rig my own.” Sally’s lips were a straight line.\r\n\r\n“Why should you go in for parachutes? But then—oh, yes—you go in for\r\nall sorts of falling.” He laughed.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “I don’t. I get dizzy. But I promised Barbara that I’d\r\ngo down with her it they asked her to try parachuting.”\r\n\r\n“You did! That takes courage!”\r\n\r\n“Where’s the war job that doesn’t?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s not so bad.” He blew an imaginary smoke ring. “You just sit on\r\nthe edge of a hole until they give you the word. Then you look up, slide\r\nthrough the hole, and down you go. When the parachute is open it is\r\nreally swell, like dreams we have of flying just with our hands. When\r\nyou land you curl up like a sleepy kitten, roll on the ground, then get\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“You make it sound so nice!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\nSally turned a knob on the radio. She snapped on a headset and said:\r\n“Hello, are you there?” Then she listened.\r\n\r\n“How do you get me?” she spoke into the mouthpiece again. “Good as ever?\r\nThat’s fine. This is Sally signing off.\r\n\r\n“See!” She turned to Danny.\r\n\r\n“Pete’s sake! What wave-length do you use?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Only one person in the world knows that. He’s the man who made it. My\r\nold friend C. K. All I know is, it’s very short. Watch!”\r\n\r\nShe snapped off the lights, then pulled down the shades. The radio’s\r\ntubes glowed red.\r\n\r\n“Say! A radio with its own private wave length is worth a fortune! I\r\nknow a man high up in Communications. Let me show it to him.”\r\n\r\n“Not for worlds.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be rich and famous.”\r\n\r\n“No! No! Oh, I wish I hadn’t brought it here. Can’t you see that it was\r\nloaned to me by a very dear friend and that he alone can release it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied soberly. “I won’t breathe a word about it until you\r\ngive me the sign.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks—oh, thanks!” she stammered. “You really had me worried.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” he said, “how about having another try at the ‘put-put’ of\r\nthe gremlins, or subs?”\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes more they sat there in the dark watching the red glow of\r\nthe strange radio tubes but hearing just nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, it came, a low\r\n“put-put-put-put-a-put-put-put-put-a-put.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time Danny sat there silently listening. “It’s code, all\r\nright,” he murmured once. “There’s a sort of rhythm to it, just as there\r\nis to all code.”\r\n\r\n“If you turn this dial,” Sally whispered, “it will throw them out.” She\r\nturned the dial. Silence followed, but not for long. Again came\r\n“put-put-put-a-put.”\r\n\r\n“They’re back,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“No, that’s another one. Listen! You can tell the difference.” She\r\nbrought the first one back, then switched to the second.\r\n\r\n“What do you know about that!” He was all ears.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the ‘put’ stands for dot, and ‘put-a-put’ for dash,” he\r\nsuggested. “I’ll just try it that way.”\r\n\r\n“Might be the opposite!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, just anything.” He snapped on a small light and then began\r\nmarking down dots and dashes as he listened. For a long time neither of\r\nthem spoke.\r\n\r\n“That might be it,” he breathed at last. “It’s hard to take down, but\r\nI’ve got dot, dot, dot, dash, dot. That’s three, dash, dash, dash for\r\nfive and dash, dash, dot, dot, for seven. Then there are some numbers\r\nthat seem like seventeen, twenty-three, and thirty-one. I can’t be\r\nsure—”\r\n\r\n“Give me a pencil and paper,” she suggested. “Let me play the game.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time after that they listened and marked down dots and\r\ndashes. When one sender went off the air they switched to another. In\r\ntime they came to believe that number one and number two were holding a\r\nconversation. Then number two went off the air, followed by number one.\r\n\r\nA little search found a third. When number three went dead, number one\r\nwas at it again. It became an interesting game of hide-and-go-seek, in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n“Could it be one of our convoys?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Hardly that. They maintain radio silence, I’m told. But with such a\r\nradio, who knows? But if they are subs, a whole wolf-pack of them!” he\r\nexclaimed a moment later.\r\n\r\n“And if we could spot them!”\r\n\r\n“While we were on a ship, an aircraft carrier! Spot them some distance\r\naway and go after them with a dozen planes loaded with depth-bombs. I’ll\r\ntell you what!” he exclaimed, becoming greatly excited. “I’ll be ready\r\nto sail in a month or two, on an aircraft carrier. You get a radio job\r\non my ship. Then we’ll really try this radio out.”\r\n\r\n“They’re not sending WAVES on ships yet,” she reminded.\r\n\r\n“Oh! We’ll manage it,” he insisted, “We’ll just have to.”\r\n\r\n“We may discover that we’re mostly just duplicating one of Uncle Sam’s\r\nsecrets.” Sally was cautious by nature. “These code signals may come\r\nfrom American ships or airplanes.”\r\n\r\n“Tell you what!” he exclaimed. “We’ve just got to de-code their messages\r\nso we can tell what they say. Then we’ll know. But that,” he sighed\r\nheavily, “looks like a long, long job.”\r\n\r\nThey pitched into that job once more and had been working for some time\r\nwhen he said: “By the way, did you have a class tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, from eight to nine.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind then, it’s nine now.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she exclaimed. “I must go! I’ll get a black mark. Unhook my radio\r\nand let me go.”\r\n\r\n“There you are,” he said a moment later, as he handed her the radio,\r\n“but you’ll be back?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Sure! It’s been exciting. Just think what it will mean if we really\r\ndo something big with old C. K.’s radio.”\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking,” he replied soberly. “Just keep trying, and mum’s\r\nthe word. We’ll get there yet!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n                       THROUGH A HOLE IN THE SKY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the week-days that followed, there were no more long night trysts\r\nover the secret radio. Sally had a record to maintain. She had resolved\r\nat the very beginning to be one of the best WAVES ever entrusted with a\r\njob in Communications. She had decided, too, to move heaven and earth to\r\nget a spot on some ship sailing the seven seas. She knew quite well that\r\nthe best way to get what you want is to earn it. Classes must always\r\ncome first.\r\n\r\nFor all that, she and Danny did each day spend one glorious twilight\r\nhour working away at the secret radio. When Saturday night came, the\r\nWAVES one free night, Nancy joined them, and working both radios at\r\nonce, they really went places and did things. Using both radios, they\r\nspotted as many as eight broadcasters of the mysterious pack on a single\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“Are they really enemy subs?” Nancy asked.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” was all Danny would say. “If they are we’ve really got\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“But they may be cargo ships in a convoy or airplanes going to Europe,”\r\nsaid Nancy. “Then why don’t we ask our Communications people in\r\nWashington whether they are using that wave-length.”\r\n\r\n“Two good reasons,” Danny grinned. “We don’t know the wave-length we’re\r\nusing and if we did the folks in Washington wouldn’t tell us.”\r\n\r\n“Probably send an F. B. I. agent to look us up,” Sally said. “No,\r\ndearie! We’ve got to work it out all by ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Just give us time and we’ll make it,” Danny declared. Ah, yes, there\r\nwas the rub. All too soon the bugle would blow and they would be\r\nscattered far and wide to new fields of endeavor.\r\n\r\nThey made some progress. One evening Danny exclaimed: “See here! The\r\nnumbers they are sending—if they are numbers—are all odd. Seven,\r\nseventeen, thirty-one, forty-three. There’s not an even number in the\r\nlot.”\r\n\r\n“That narrows it down,” said Sally.\r\n\r\n“It sure does.”\r\n\r\nTwo evenings later Sally made a more important discovery.\r\n\r\n“Look!” She jumped to her feet in her excitement, to point at a row of\r\nnumbers. “Not one of them is evenly divisible. Seven, seventeen,\r\nthirty-seven, fifty-three, every last one of them. Does that mean\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\n“It may mean a lot,” was Danny’s excited comment.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there’s the bell!” she exclaimed. “Time for class. Think of\r\ndropping this discovery just like that.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not dropped.”\r\n\r\nDanny dragged out a tall stack of papers. “I’ll still be working on that\r\nwhen you’re fast asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Danny, you’re a treasure!” she exclaimed, giving his hand a quick\r\nsqueeze.\r\n\r\n“It’s all part of the game,” he grinned. “We’ll be famous, both of us,\r\nand your old friend C. K., as well.”\r\n\r\nThe hour was striking midnight when at last Danny stacked the papers in\r\na neat pile.\r\n\r\n“Got it!” he breathed. “It’s the berries. Can’t be any mistake about\r\nthat. We’re really making progress. But we’ve still got a long way to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nThat very night one more major problem brought Sally’s radio\r\nexperimentation to an abrupt halt.\r\n\r\nShe returned to her room, after her late hour of study, to find Barbara\r\nsitting in her bed staring gloomily at the floor.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” she asked. “Been caught out of bounds, or\r\nsomething?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t done a thing,” Barbara replied gloomily. “Perhaps it would be\r\nbetter if I did. When you never step off the beaten path, just plug\r\nalong day by day, people ask you to do such terrible things.”\r\n\r\n“Why? What have they asked you to do now?”\r\n\r\n“It’s that parachute drop.” Barbara stared gloomily at her feet. “They\r\nsay it’s not really required that a parachute rigger should take\r\nparachute training, but that if they do take it, and if they do take\r\njust one drop, they make better riggers.”\r\n\r\n“Of course they do,” Sally agreed. “They know what it’s all about.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds all right. But would you want to go to an airfield where\r\nonly men are training, and go through all the practice and finally take\r\nthe drop, all by yourself?”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not. Are they asking you to do that?”\r\n\r\n“Not asking, just suggesting.”\r\n\r\n“Which in this war is the same thing. Tell you what—” Sally came to a\r\nsudden decision. “If Lieutenant Mayfare will let me, I’ll go through the\r\ntraining with you.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t!” Barbara stared.\r\n\r\n“I said I would, didn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you don’t have to.”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not, but I want to. If I’m to go in for Radio and\r\nCommunications I want to be prepared to serve anywhere, on land, on the\r\nsea, or in the air.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barbara Was Staring Gloomily at the Floor]\r\n\r\n“You’re the daffiest person I ever knew—and the dandiest!” At that big\r\nBarbara hugged Sally until she thought her ribs would crack.\r\n\r\n“But, Sally, you don’t have to go in for parachute jumping if you’re\r\ngoing in for Radio,” Lieutenant Mayfare protested when Sally made her\r\nunusual request next day.\r\n\r\n“But I want to,” Sally insisted.\r\n\r\n“You’re doing it to help Barbara. Is that fair to yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Who knows what is fair?” Sally asked quietly. “It’s not fair to ask a\r\nboy to give up his college work right in the middle of his first year to\r\ngo to war. Or is it? It’s not fair to ask a father to leave two small\r\nchildren for the same reason. Or is it? Who knows—\r\n\r\n“Anyway I’d like the experience,” she added after a brief silence.\r\n“There are several things we are not being asked to do now. Perhaps\r\ntomorrow or next month we will be asked. I want to be prepared. And\r\nafter all, I think it’s a small matter.”\r\n\r\n“Not so small.” The officer spoke slowly. “You’ll have to spend the last\r\nhalf of every afternoon for a week preparing for it.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she added, “your work here has been excellent. The time\r\nlost will not matter so much. So—”\r\n\r\n“Then I may do it?” Sally exclaimed eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you may!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Thank you! Thank you a lot!”\r\n\r\n“It is Barbara who should be thankful. I doubt if she could take the\r\ntest alone.”\r\n\r\n“She couldn’t,” Sally agreed. “Barbara is a fine girl. She’s true blue.\r\nThere are not many things she could do in our organization. For\r\nparachute rigging she’s perfect.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“And I want her to be a great success.”\r\n\r\n“With your help I’m sure she will be. You and she may start your\r\ntraining this afternoon. The sooner the better. There’s not much time\r\nleft—”\r\n\r\nAnd that is why Danny Duke had to wait so long to tell Sally of his\r\ngrand discoveries.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Sally and Barbara rode five miles to the training field\r\nwith six boys who were to take the same training.\r\n\r\n“Pipe the girls,” one fellow called when they were first sighted.\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” another boy exclaimed low. “If they are going to take to the\r\nchutes, it’s not just for fun. It really takes guts. If they’ve got what\r\nit takes you have to hand it to them.”\r\n\r\n“Ever run a children’s playground?” the director asked Sally.\r\n\r\n“Yes, once, quite a while ago—”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is just another one of them. Only difference is you swing on\r\nyour chute straps just to get used to them instead of from the old apple\r\ntree. And if you don’t fasten your straps just right you get a good\r\nbump.”\r\n\r\n“And you learn by bumps,” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that way you don’t get killed later.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the same way with the slide,” the instructor added. “It’s just a\r\nkid’s slide, only longer, and you fall harder—that is, if you don’t\r\nrelax properly.”\r\n\r\nAfter that, for a full week-the two girls practiced swinging, sliding,\r\ntumbling, whirling round and round.\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I’d been put in a cement mixer and whirled round and round\r\na thousand times,” Sally confided to Danny on Saturday afternoon. “But I\r\ndo believe that Barbara will go through with it. Monday is our zero\r\nhour. We drop at dusk. And I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say a prayer for you,” Danny grinned. “And now about this secret\r\ncode of the gremlins, the enemy subs, or what have you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes!” Sally exclaimed eagerly. “What did you find out?”\r\n\r\n“A whole lot and yet, not half enough. Come over just after chow, if you\r\ncan. Bring the radios and I’ll tell you all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Surely not that much!” Sally held up her hands in mock horror.\r\n“All the same, I’ll be there!”\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” Danny said, as they sat before the radio that night\r\nlistening to the “put-put-put-a-put.” “They’ve made their code from\r\nnumbers that can be divided evenly. I’m sure of that. But does one stand\r\nfor the letter A, or have they arranged it all backwards?”\r\n\r\n“They may have started in the middle and gone both ways.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I don’t think they did. Why should they? They had the\r\nwave-length all to themselves. Why not have a simple code? I even think\r\nthey let one stand for A, three for B, five for C, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think that?”\r\n\r\n“Because eleven, which should stand for E, is used more times than any\r\nother number and E is the most-used letter in the alphabet. Other vowels\r\nstand out in the same proportion. So I think we’ve got that far. But\r\nnow,” he sighed, “we’ve got to find out whether they’re sending in\r\nGerman or English. That is going to be hard.”\r\n\r\n“And must be continued in our next.” There was a suggestion of gloom in\r\nSally’s voice. She was tired and sore. Much lay ahead.\r\n\r\n“Monday we drop from that hole in the sky. Tuesday we take our finals,”\r\nshe sighed.\r\n\r\n“And Wednesday you scatter,” he supplied. “I got that on good authority.\r\nSome of you go to other schools and some to work, depending on what\r\nyou’re taking up.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about it. We’ll just have to work and hope we meet again over\r\nthis blessed, tantalizing, mesmerizing radio,” she laughed. “And now,\r\nwhat do you say we take the radio over to my house and then make a night\r\nof it?”\r\n\r\nAnd that was just what they did.\r\n\r\nMonday afternoon came, and with it, many a long-drawn breath.\r\n\r\n“Sally, I’m scared,” Barbara whispered, as they piled into the car that\r\nwas to take them on their last trip to the field.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t be natural if you weren’t,” was the cheering response.\r\n“All the same, try to forget it.”\r\n\r\nIn the week that had passed, the eight of them, two girls and six boys,\r\nhad formed the habit of singing on the way out. Now, when at last they\r\nrolled away, a youthful voice struck up:\r\n\r\n          He’d fly through the air with the greatest of ease,\r\n          A daring young man on the flying trapeze.\r\n\r\n“Where have I heard that before?” another boy groaned. For all that,\r\nthey sang it with gusto.\r\n\r\n“‘Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main,’” came next.\r\n\r\nThen the boy from Kentucky started:\r\n\r\n“‘The sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home—’”\r\n\r\nHis voice broke on the second line. Sally swallowed hard, but they sang\r\nit through to the end.\r\n\r\n“Ioway! Ioway!” shouted the boy from the midwest. “That’s where the tall\r\ncorn grows.”\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, but when the strains of “Swanee River” came rolling\r\nout, they were in a mellow mood once more.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the field they found a captive balloon straining at\r\nits ropes. Beneath it hung a platform and at the very center of the\r\nplatform was a round hole.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Sally, “is the famous hole in the sky.”\r\n\r\n“On fields where paratroops are trained we have towers to jump from, but\r\nthey cost a pile of money. A balloon works just as well,” a friendly\r\nlieutenant explained.\r\n\r\n“Sure, even better,” wisecracked the boy from Kentucky. “Then if you\r\ndon’t feel like dropping off, you can just cut the rope and go for a\r\nballoon ride.”\r\n\r\n“I’m in favor of a balloon ride right now,” said his pal.\r\n\r\nA latticework of ropes formed a wall about the platform. Over this they\r\nclimbed. Then, slowly, majestically the balloon rose skyward.\r\n\r\nOnce more—“‘Sailing, sailing,’” rang out on the air.\r\n\r\n“Old Kentucky Home” was a little too much this time. It expired in the\r\nmiddle of the second verse.\r\n\r\n“Pack Up Your Troubles” went very well and the “Man on the Flying\r\nTrapeze” was as popular as ever.\r\n\r\nOne big fellow they called Samson sat hunched up in a corner, not\r\nsinging and saying nothing.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter? Scared?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Thunder, no!” he exploded. “Sleepy, that’s all. What’s a little\r\nparachute jump? If you’d grown up on a cattle ranch with the big bulls\r\nchasin’ you and the lonesome coyotes callin’, you wouldn’t mind. I fell\r\noff a mountain once and no parachute stopped me, just a pine tree.”\r\n\r\n“I’m scared,” Barbara whispered. Sally made no reply. Truth was, her\r\nstomach was pumping in a strange way. She saw the boy from Kentucky gulp\r\ntwice. That didn’t help any.\r\n\r\n“We’re about there,” the instructor announced. “If your stomachs don’t\r\nfeel good, forget it. That’s the way mine feels right now, and I’ve\r\njumped three hundred times.\r\n\r\n“Now remember,” he added, “when you slide off, keep looking up. That way\r\nyour chin doesn’t hook on the parachute straps.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said in a strong, clear voice, “we’re here. See that green\r\nlight? That’s the signal. Don’t be nervous. Your parachutes have been\r\nproperly rigged. I watched it done. Don’t forget, I’ll be right behind\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nBefore they went up, they had been given numbers. Barbara’s number was\r\nseven, Sally’s eight. That meant that, except for the instructor, they\r\nwould be last. Sally did not know whether this was good or bad. For\r\nBarbara to go first would be terrible. But would watching the others\r\ndisappear wear away her slender thread of courage? She could only hope\r\nthat it would not.\r\n\r\n“Action stations,” the instructor snapped. Number one, the big fellow\r\nraised on a cattle ranch, took his place, dangling his feet over the\r\nhole. With his arms hanging straight down, he looked up.\r\n\r\n“Number one!” The big fellow vanished into the thin air below. “Number\r\ntwo!” One more vanished. Sally’s throat went dry. “Number three!” There\r\nthey went. “Number four!” Oppressive silence followed. Sally gasped. Had\r\nsomething gone wrong? Then she remembered they were to go down by fours,\r\nwith a space between each group. “Two fast sticks,” they called it. She\r\nfelt quite like a stick just then.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, she began to count—one, two, three, four. She mopped her\r\nbrow. She dared not look at Barbara. “Five, six, seven.” She had reached\r\nfifteen when the instructor took up the counting once more. “Number\r\nfive.” One more man vanished.\r\n\r\n“Get ready,” Sally whispered. On Barbara’s face was a look of do-or-die.\r\n\r\n“Number six.” The last boy vanished.\r\n\r\n“Now.” Barbara slid into her place. Her hands were at her sides, her\r\nchin high. When she heard “Number seven” she slid from sight.\r\n\r\nIn her eagerness to follow, Sally nearly went down without an order. As\r\nit was, she sank breathlessly down until, with startling suddenness, she\r\nfelt a pull at her straps and knew her parachute had opened.\r\n\r\n“Good old chute!” she murmured as she glanced up to catch its white\r\ngleam against the sky.\r\n\r\nShe looked for Barbara. Yes, there she was off to the left, floating\r\ndown with the greatest of ease. This was Barbara’s big moment, perhaps\r\nthe biggest moment of all her life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Good Old Chute!” Sally Murmured]\r\n\r\nBut here was a voice coming up from below: “You’re coming down nicely,\r\nnumber seven,” it said. That would be Barbara.\r\n\r\n“Number four, bend those knees. Don’t be trying to land stiff legged.”\r\nIt was the voice again. An instructor was talking through a loudspeaker.\r\nHis voice carried up to them perfectly.\r\n\r\n“Number eight,” he called.\r\n\r\n“Oh! He’s calling me!” Sally thought in sudden panic. “Number eight, you\r\nmust turn round. Reach up, grab the strap.” Sally obeyed. She swung half\r\nabout. “That’s it. Always land with the wind, not against it.\r\n\r\n“Now, all of you, knees bent, feet together, relax, relax for a fall.”\r\n\r\nOne by one they tumbled on the ground, then jumped up laughing.\r\n\r\nSally made a quick count. Yes, all eight were up and moving. Then,\r\nhaving unfastened her parachute, she rushed over to Barbara to exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Barbara! You were wonderful!”\r\n\r\nThrowing her arms about her, Barbara burst into tears of joy.\r\n\r\nWhen the shower had passed, she exclaimed, “Now I am going to be a\r\nparachute rigger always, for I know just how much it means!”\r\n\r\n“Boy, oh, boy!” Sally exclaimed when at last she was alone with her\r\ninstructor. “I hope I get a chance to make use of that experience. That\r\ncertainly was something!”\r\n\r\n“It’s been my experience,” he replied soberly, “that in this war, sooner\r\nor later, we find a place for every bit of practice we’ve ever had. Your\r\ntime will come.”\r\n\r\nWould it? Sally wondered a long, long wonder. She was still wondering\r\nwhen she got back to school. Secret radios, ships, airplanes,\r\nparachutes, all went round and round in her head. What was in store for\r\nher? In a day or two she would be whirled away to another school for\r\nfurther training.\r\n\r\n“And after that, what?” she asked the elm that had once saved her from\r\ndisaster. The elm whispered to the breeze, but she could not understand\r\nwhat the tree and the breezes were saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n                              SILENT STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, like autumn leaves caught in a miniature whirlwind, they were\r\nsent spinning away in all directions. There was one happy evening hour\r\nwhen Sally, Nancy, Barbara, and Danny had lunch together in the Purple\r\nCow, just off the campus. Theirs was the hail-and-farewell of good\r\nfellows well met, of soldiers who might never meet again. And yet,\r\nbehind all their jokes and laughter was a feeling of friendship and\r\ndevotion to one another that in all the years could never die.\r\n\r\n“We’ll be seeing you,” they shouted next morning.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure! We’ll be together again, sooner than you think!”\r\n\r\n“Good-by!”\r\n\r\n“Good-by!”\r\n\r\nSally and Nancy were sent to the beautiful campus of a great mid-western\r\nuniversity where they would learn much more about radio and\r\ncommunications. Barbara was shipped off to a big airport to receive her\r\nfinal training in the art of rigging parachutes. Danny remained behind,\r\nbut not for long. The autumn winds would soon whisk him away to new\r\nfields of adventure and duty.\r\n\r\nBoth Sally and Nancy had dreamed of attending some truly great\r\nuniversity. And, at last, here they were. But for how long? Just long\r\nenough to make you efficient in your chosen field, was the precise\r\nanswer. “And always remember, your services are badly needed right now.\r\nGood communications and radio men are scarce. They are badly needed\r\noverseas.”\r\n\r\n“But won’t we two be sent overseas?” Nancy asked of the major who gave\r\nthem the information.\r\n\r\n“That remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain, no WAVE will be\r\nsent overseas until she has perfected herself in her particular branch,\r\nand has served long enough at one of our bases here in America to prove\r\nthat she will be a valuable addition to our Navy, either aboard ship or\r\noverseas.”\r\n\r\n“Right here is where I forget this Gothic architecture, the shady walks,\r\nthe cozy nooks that help to make this big school what it is,” Sally\r\nsaid, as a look of determination spread over her face. “I’m going to\r\nwork and study day and night, for we are in the Navy now.”\r\n\r\n“I’m right behind you,” Nancy agreed. “All the same, when this terrible\r\nscrap is over, I’m coming right back here and be a regular student as\r\nlong as I please. And believe me, I’m going to have all the\r\ntrimmings—class dances, proms, shady walks and all the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Shake on that.” Sally held out her hand. That handshake was a solemn\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n“And now to business.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time on their heads were bent, for long hours, over study\r\ndesks, radios, clattering keys.\r\n\r\nTheir day was not done when darkness fell, nor their week when Saturday\r\nrolled round. They did not, like Barbara, hide under the covers to study\r\nwith a flashlight when night came. They rented bicycles for the entire\r\nperiod of their stay at the university. On many a night farmers saw\r\nstrange lights winking and blinking from one hill to another in their\r\npastures. Sally and Nancy were practicing the light-blinking code they\r\nhad studied that day. Twice they were reported as spies, but nothing\r\ncame of it for they never returned to the same pasture twice, and it\r\nwould have been a fleet-footed farm boy who could have rounded them up\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon, armed with dozens of multicolored flags, they\r\nreturned to these same hills to practice flag signals. White and blue\r\nwith a notch in the end stood for A, blue, white, red, white and blue in\r\nstripes was C, and so on and on to white with a red spot for one, blue\r\nwith a white spot for two, and so on.\r\n\r\nWith good memories and a zeal for learning seldom witnessed by those\r\ngray stone walls, they went through the school in record time and were\r\nonce more on the move.\r\n\r\n“Now we’re really going to work,” Sally cried, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and at one of the biggest air bases on our long seacoast,” Nancy\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\n“Florida and the sea. Um—” Sally breathed, “that’s worth working for.”\r\n\r\n“It sure is!”\r\n\r\n“There’s something else I’m going to work harder than ever for—” Sally\r\nspoke with conviction.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to try to cut ‘Florida and the sea’ down to just the good,\r\nold ‘sea.’ All my life I’ve waited for that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. There are the enemy sub-packs. They’re really\r\ndangerous. The water’s awfully cold.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it.” Sally’s eyes shone. “There are the sub-packs—you\r\nhaven’t forgotten our secret radios?”\r\n\r\n“Almost,” Nancy admitted.\r\n\r\n“I tried them twice back at the U, when you were gone,” Sally confided.\r\n“Nothing doing. Guess we were too far from the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Florida will be better.”\r\n\r\n“Much better, but the sea will be better still.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” Nancy replied dreamily. “But don’t forget, your enemy\r\nsub-pack may turn out to be friendly ships or planes.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t forget. All the same, I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Wonder where Danny is.”\r\n\r\n“And Barbara.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I forgot to tell you. I had a letter from Barbara this morning.\r\nGuess where she is now?”\r\n\r\n“Where we’re going?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just where she is. Won’t it be great if you can hop off from the\r\nsky with her again?” Nancy laughed.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t mind. I’ll bet you an ice-cream soda I’ll have a chance to\r\nuse that experience before the year is over.”\r\n\r\n“Easy aces! You’re on. If I never win another bet, that’s one for me.”\r\n\r\nWas Nancy too confident? In this world at war many strange things can\r\nhappen, and many do.\r\n\r\nNot so long after that, Sally found herself seated on the top of a high\r\ntower that overlooked a vast airfield. The skies were full of floating\r\nplanes. The roar of powerful motors beat upon her eardrums. In her hand\r\nshe held a score sheet, and, at the steady, carefully spoken words of a\r\nmarine in a major’s uniform, she recorded hours, moments, numbers, and\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nOn the officer’s head was a set of earphones. About his neck a\r\nchin-speaker was attached. From time to time, speaking always in that\r\nsteady, even tone, he said:\r\n\r\n“Come on down, six, four, three. Wind velocity, fifteen miles per hour,\r\nnorth-north-east.”\r\n\r\nAnd again: “Circle once more, three-six-eight. Fast one coming in from\r\nthe east.”\r\n\r\nThere were long periods of time when he said nothing, just stood there\r\nstaring dreamily away toward the sea. But always he appeared to listen,\r\nas indeed he did, for listening to the radio voice of great four-motored\r\nbombers, inviting them to come in, advising them to wait, telling them\r\nwhen to take off, informing them regarding weather, was his duty. And on\r\nhis ears, eyes and voice hung the life of many a fine young flier.\r\n\r\nRed Storm, his fellow officers called him, some times “Silent Storm.”\r\nHis real name was Robert Storm. Silent Storm was the name Sally liked\r\nbest, although, of course, she never called him that, always Major\r\nStorm.\r\n\r\nHe seemed young for a major and certainly was handsome in a big, tall,\r\nred-headed way. He seldom spoke to her except to instruct her in her\r\nwork. He was teaching her his own work, so she could take his place.\r\nNancy too was learning the work, but at a different period.\r\n\r\nAs Major Storm stood there looking away during quiet times, she often\r\nwondered about that faraway look in his eyes. Then, too, there was the\r\nlong scar across his right cheek and the look of utter weariness that\r\ncame over his face at times when he slumped down in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Major Storm,” she said one day, speaking with a sudden impulse that\r\nsurprised her, “what does one do to make people want one as a friend?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t make people want you as a friend,” was his quick reply. “They\r\neither wish to be your friend or they don’t, and that’s all there is to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Are—are you sure?” she asked a little startled.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, they might not care to have you as a friend but you might\r\nbe able to do something that would make them wish to do something for\r\nyou—you know, like—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know what you mean. The answer to that is simple then. Take an\r\ninterest in them first. Find out about their lives, their families,\r\ntheir problems. Have a sympathetic interest in them. If they’re human,\r\nthey’ll do the same for you. That’s simple, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Very simple.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he spoke in a different tone: “Come on in, Johnny.”\r\n\r\nAfter sweeping the sky with his binoculars, he settled down in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n“That radio boy on that big bomber is Johnny, one of my own boys. I\r\ntaught him. He’s a fine boy. I suppose the war will get him sooner or\r\nlater. It seems rather useless to care for them too much. They go away\r\nand—”\r\n\r\n“You never see them again.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“But, by the way,” his voice rose, “you have one very good friend,\r\neminently worth while, I’d say.”\r\n\r\n“I have several,” she smiled. She was happy, happier than she had been\r\nfor days. She had really started Silent Storm talking. “But then,” she\r\nthought with a shy smile, “who ever heard of a really, truly silent\r\nstorm, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“This friend of yours,” he said quietly, “is also a very old friend of\r\nmine—old C. K., we used to call him.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean C. K. Kennedy!” She stared in disbelief.\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly who I do mean. He taught me most of what I know about\r\nradio. He’s one man in a million.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Then—” she exclaimed, “then we’re practically cousins!”\r\n\r\n“Something like that,” he replied dryly.\r\n\r\nThen, springing to his feet, he said: “Okay—come in, three-two-six.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all for then. Evening was coming on. Many big ships were\r\ncoming in through the blue. Every moment was taken from then to the end\r\nof the shift. Yes, that was all for then, but it was enough to keep the\r\ngirl dreaming in the golden twilight, under the palms when the day’s\r\nwork was done. And those were strange dreams. Secret radios, ships,\r\nsubmarines, giant four-motored bombers, old C. K. and Silent Storm were\r\nall there in one glorious mixup of lights and shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n                           DANGER IS MY DUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nSince there were many WAVES stationed at this great air and marine base,\r\nthey had taken over a very fine little hotel down by the sea.\r\n\r\n“Nancy! This is gorgeous!” Sally had exclaimed on their arrival. “If it\r\nweren’t for the secret radio, I would be glad to stay here until the war\r\nis won.”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ wonderful,” Nancy replied thoughtfully. “Florida, the blue,\r\nblue sea, and these lovely quarters! It’s really hard to believe, but,\r\nyou know, this isn’t the sort of thing I joined up for. I expected a\r\ntruly hard life. The boys in the jungles of those South Sea islands and\r\non the sandy deserts of Africa—they don’t have it easy, so why should\r\nwe—?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” was the quick response. “If all the people of America,\r\nespecially those who have lived soft lives—oh, I don’t mean who don’t\r\nwork—but those who have had all they want, always, always slept in a\r\nsoft bed, and always gone for a long ride in the old bus on a Sunday\r\nafternoon, could really be dragged out of it all and have it good and\r\ntough for a while, wouldn’t it be grand?\r\n\r\n“But then,” Sally added in a quieter voice, “we might as well make the\r\nbest of all this beauty and comfort, for something tells me that it\r\nwon’t last too long.”\r\n\r\nAfter her first real talk with Major Storm, Sally returned to her hotel,\r\nate her dinner, then, returning to her room, dragged out her secret\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nShe had barely started thumbing its dials, when a phone call announced a\r\ncaller.\r\n\r\nHurrying down to the hotel lobby, she barely refrained from throwing\r\nherself into the arms of this guest.\r\n\r\n“Danny!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Taking a little final training and waiting for a ship,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“What kind of ship, Danny?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Ah!” He held up a finger. “Loose talk may sink a ship.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’m sorry. Then how about our radio? May we talk about that?”\r\n\r\n“Not only may, but must. I’ve studied those records from their code\r\nmessages. They’re really revealing. That’s why I came.”\r\n\r\n“I just got out the radio, but Danny, you’re not allowed in my room.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Danny! What Are You Doing Here?”]\r\n\r\n“Of course not, but we’re both allowed in the radio experimental\r\nstation, providing one of us has a friend there, which I have, so—”\r\n\r\n“So what are we waiting for?”\r\n\r\n“Sure! What?”\r\n\r\n“I—I’ll be right back.” Sally was off for the radio.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have such an aerial as you never dreamed of, over at the\r\nstation,” he confided, once they were on their way. “We’ll bring those\r\nenemy subs up so close we can practically talk to them.”\r\n\r\n“Danny,” she whispered, “do you really think they were enemy subs we\r\nwere hearing?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he hesitated, “I’d hate to say I am sure of it, but I’ve studied\r\nthat secret code so carefully that I am positive that it goes the way we\r\nthought it did.”\r\n\r\n“But the language? Is it English or German?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied thoughtfully, “that’s the real question. I got out my\r\nold German dictionary and gave it a really good workout. All I can say\r\nis that it’s a lot easier to make sense out of those code messages in\r\nGerman than it is in English.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danny! You are wonderful!” She pressed his arm. “Just think what a\r\nglorious victory it will be if we succeed in listening to the message of\r\nthose wolf-packs!”\r\n\r\n“When no one else has done it? Boy, oh, boy!”\r\n\r\n“What a triumph for old C. K.!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“Danny, you’ve never met him. That’s too bad.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve met you—in fact, once I actually caught you,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Danny, today I talked with my boss, Major Storm, and he told me old C.\r\nK. taught him radio. He says C. K. is one man in a million. Isn’t that a\r\ngreat break?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. But why?”\r\n\r\n“Because if I want a chance to do something different, like going to sea\r\nso I can try out this radio, if I tell him it’s really for old C. K.,\r\nSilent Storm will help me.”\r\n\r\n“Silent Storm! What a name!” Danny laughed low.\r\n\r\n“It’s not the name that counts, but the man, and I—I think he’s going\r\nto be fine.”\r\n\r\n“Sure! Sure! I know he will,” Danny agreed. “And now, here’s the\r\nstation.”\r\n\r\nIn a small room they set up the radio and, having attached it to the\r\naerial connections, turned on the current. Almost at once, there came\r\nthe “put-put-put-a-put” of a code message.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Got ’em,” Danny breathed.\r\n\r\n“And it’s so much louder, so much more distinct!” Sally was delighted.\r\nDanny scarcely heard for he was busy recording dots and dashes.\r\n\r\nSoon Sally was at it, too, for by now she too could read code very well.\r\nFrom time to time, however, by turning that certain dial, she switched\r\nfrom one sender to another. She located six in all.\r\n\r\nBut, even as they continued to listen and record, there came a change.\r\nAt first the messages were sent in a slow, methodical manner. But now\r\nthey came in close together, excited, irregular and jerky. At the same\r\ntime they appeared to draw closer to one another.\r\n\r\n“Sally.” Danny dropped his pencil. “Once I watched a pack of wolves\r\nchase an old and disabled moose. Their barks and howls were just like\r\nthis radio business we’re hearing. At first there was the regular yap,\r\nyap of the chase. But when they closed in they became greatly excited.\r\nTheir barks, howling, and snarls came from excited minds and\r\nbloodthirsty throats. They were in for the kill.”\r\n\r\nAs Sally listened, she seemed to see six subs closing in on a ship\r\ncarrying supplies of food, guns, or ammunition to our soldiers in Africa\r\nand at the end caught the excited “put-put-put” of their radios as they\r\nclosed in for the kill.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps tomorrow we will hear on the radio of another ship sunk off our\r\nshore,” she whispered hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” was the sober reply. “Tonight they seem very close.”\r\n\r\n“Danny, we must hurry!” She gripped his hand. “We must learn more. I\r\nmust go to sea, somehow, I must. I am sure that will help most of all.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will go,” was his quiet reply.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, as she worked at her highly important, if slightly\r\ntiring, task of bringing in the big planes only to send them out again,\r\nSally said:\r\n\r\n“Major Storm, why is that faraway look on your face?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” He gave her a sharp look. “Is it noticeable?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks for telling me. I shall discipline my thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“Is it so terribly bad to want to be in one place, when you are serving\r\nin another?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Rather bad,” was the slow reply. “We do not always give our best, that\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to be in some other place?” he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Not—not just now!” she stammered, taken aback. “But sometime, not too\r\nfar away, I’d like to be transferred to a fighting ship.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Ships are dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Danger is my duty.” She felt that she was quoting someone, but could\r\nnot recall where she had heard those words before.\r\n\r\n“Danger is my duty,” he repeated after her. “That’s rather good, but you\r\nhaven’t answered my question. Danger can’t be an end, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I have a secret,” was the odd reply.\r\n\r\n“I’m told that most young ladies of your age have several secrets.”\r\n\r\n“Not important ones. This one may be of great importance. It has to do\r\nwith our mutual friend, C. K. Kennedy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Then it is important!” he exclaimed. “Tell me about it—that is, if\r\nyou are free to do so.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure he would tell you at least part of it if he were here. He has\r\ninvented a new radio that operates on a secret wave length. I think the\r\nenemy sub-packs operate on that same band.”\r\n\r\n“The enemy sub-packs!” he stared. “Wait, there’s a plane.\r\n\r\n“Come in, six-three-nine.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s not talk about this now,” he suggested. “It’s too vital. We might\r\nbecome absorbed in it and neglect our duty, commit a tragic blunder.\r\nSuppose you have dinner at my house tonight. It’s quite proper. My\r\nsister lives with me.”\r\n\r\n“All—all right.” Sally found herself strangely excited.\r\n\r\n“I’ll call for you at seven.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be waiting.”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the afternoon was pure routine, but Sally’s mind\r\nwandered often to thoughts of that dinner date. “Much may come of that.\r\nVery, very much,” she told herself more than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n                            SALLY STEPS OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place Sally and Silent Storm entered a few hours later was a\r\nCalifornia-type bungalow hidden among the trees. The windows were small\r\nand high. “No chance for spying here,” Sally thought to herself.\r\n\r\nThey were met at the door by a tall, handsome lady who, Sally did not\r\nneed to be told, was Silent Storm’s sister. She appeared to take Sally\r\nto her heart at once.\r\n\r\n“Robert has often spoken of you,” she said in a friendly manner.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Has he?” Sally was a little surprised. She had thought of herself\r\nas just one more of those WAVES.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to a delightful dinner. Salad made from fruit just taken\r\nfrom the trees, delicious crabmeat, fried sea bass, hot corn bread,\r\nsweet potatoes and coffee, a great urnful—enough for three cups apiece.\r\n\r\nDinner over, Miss Storm took up some knitting that lay in a chair and\r\nsettled down by herself, because she knew her brother wished it, and she\r\nhad sensed that there was some serious business in the air.\r\n\r\n“It’s not that my sister cannot be trusted,” Silent Storm half\r\napologized when he and Sally were seated in a small, secret den, quite\r\nevidently all his own. “She is to be trusted completely. However, it is\r\na rule of war that a military secret is to be shared with no outsider,\r\nand the thing you were about to tell me up there in the tower is\r\nsomething of a military secret.”\r\n\r\n“Not—not yet—but it might, be.” She hesitated. “It’s really C. K.\r\nKennedy’s secret. He confided it to me because he hoped he could trust\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“And he can.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s right. He is a wonderful man. There is nothing I would not\r\ndo for him.”\r\n\r\n“But such an invention should be of great service to our country.”\r\n\r\n“He thought it might be. He wasn’t sure.”\r\n\r\n“So he wanted it tried out? I see. Tell me only what you think he would\r\nlike to have me know.” Lighting his pipe, he settled back in his chair.\r\n“I have very little curiosity left in me,” he went on. “I’ve seen too\r\nmuch for that. I’m interested in only one thing, to see this war brought\r\nto a successful end. I have many fine friends back there.” He swept the\r\nwest with his hand. “I shall never be able to go back to them, but I can\r\nserve where I am.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have already seen service.” Sally’s eyes lighted.\r\n\r\n“Plenty of it, too much. I was at Pearl Harbor, a flier. And I was in\r\nabout all that came after in the next seven months. Then a smart Jap got\r\nme in the back.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she breathed.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t so much. I was out of the hospital in a month. But my spine\r\nwill never be the same, I was once a swimmer, something of a champion.\r\nThat’s all over, too. But it doesn’t matter. What really hurts is that I\r\ncan’t get back to help finish what my friends and I started over there.”\r\n\r\n“And you don’t fly any more?” That seemed a terrible fate to Sally.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he smiled. “I have a fast, little single-seater and sometimes\r\nI haunt the sky, chasing seagulls and wild ducks.”\r\n\r\n“A single-seater sounds a bit selfish.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not, really. You see, I don’t trust myself too much. There’s\r\nalways the chance that—”\r\n\r\n“Something might go wrong with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’m not willing to take a chance with other people’s lives. But\r\nyou were going to tell me about that radio.” He changed the subject\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s the most remarkable invention!” Launching at once into her\r\ntheme, she talked for an hour. From time to time he interrupted to ask a\r\nquestion. His pipe went out. Twice he tried to light it and failed. Then\r\nhe gave it up.\r\n\r\nAt last she spread a pile of papers covered with dots and dashes on the\r\ntable. These were the records of the “put-put” broadcast which she and\r\nDanny had kept.\r\n\r\nAfter that for a half hour their heads were bent over these records.\r\n\r\n“This,” he said at last, after re-lighting his pipe, “promises to be\r\nsomething of great importance.\r\n\r\n“I wish you could stay with me on the airfield.” He added after a\r\nmoment, “Both you and Nancy are working in very well. You could relieve\r\nme of much tiresome routine, but for your sake and for old C. K. I’ll do\r\nall I can to get you on a ship. I do know that there is talk of giving\r\nover the communications and radio work of one ship for a single trip to\r\na group of WAVES, just to see how it works out. I’ll look into that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please do,” she begged eagerly.\r\n\r\n“You should be devoting your entire time to this secret radio business\r\nright now,” he said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“But I’m a WAVE.”\r\n\r\n“You could be given a leave of absence.”\r\n\r\n“Not without a reason. It would be necessary to explain to the officials\r\nabout the radio. And that’s just what C. K. doesn’t want.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know the story about his other invention?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, his radio detector. That was a disgrace. Some unscrupulous person\r\nstole it.”\r\n\r\n“And sold it to a foreign country. He doesn’t want that to happen\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Surely not. Well, you just keep working in your spare time. And after\r\nthat we shall see.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was the way matters were left. But not for so very long.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon was regular time out for Sally. The first person she\r\nsaw as she entered the lobby of her hotel was a big girl with a round\r\nbeaming face.\r\n\r\n“Barbara, you stranger!” she exclaimed. “Where have you been hiding?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t been hiding, been working hard,” was the big girl’s reply.\r\n“I’ve been rigging the parachutes for a ship. Danny’s ship. I saw him on\r\nit.” Her voice dropped to a whisper.\r\n\r\n“But, Barbara, they don’t use parachutes on a ship.”\r\n\r\n“On this one they do. Shush!” Barbara held a finger to her lips. “Don’t\r\nask me another thing about it.”\r\n\r\nSally thought she understood.\r\n\r\nThey went out to lunch together. After that they spent three hours\r\nshopping. When Sally returned, she found a notice for a phone call in\r\nher box.\r\n\r\n“A phone call on my day off!” she exclaimed. “Maybe a date. How grand!”\r\n\r\nIt was Danny and a date as well. He was going for a spin in the air,\r\njust a little advanced trainer cabin plane, four hundred and fifty horse\r\npower. Would Sally like a look at the airfield, the palms, and the sea\r\nfrom the air?\r\n\r\nSally most certainly would. And so it was a date.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s no use hanging one of those things on you,” Danny said\r\nwith a grin as he strapped on his parachute. “You wouldn’t know what to\r\ndo about it, if something did go wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, wouldn’t I?” she challenged. “You forget that Barbara and I took\r\nthe shorter course and graduated with honors from the sky.”\r\n\r\n“Say! That’s right, you did.” At that he produced a second parachute and\r\nhelped her strap it on.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t planning to drop me in the big pond, are you?” she joked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like that. This is a land plane. Oh, we’ll take a turn or two\r\nout over the sea but the plane’s been thoroughly worked over. Not a\r\nchance of her going wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I’ll keep my fingers crossed.” She laughed as she climbed in.\r\n\r\nWhen Danny had gone through the ritual of turning on the current, gas\r\nand oil, warming up his motor and setting his wheels for the run, they\r\nwere off.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those cloudless Florida evenings when little fishing\r\nboats, looking from the sky like toys, glide over the dark blue waters,\r\nwhen a distant steamer sends off a slow, lazy drifting cloud of smoke\r\nand all seems at peace.\r\n\r\nThey took a turn out over the ocean, then swung inland where little,\r\nblue lakes dot the dark green of forests and the lighter green of farms.\r\n\r\n“Nice place, Florida,” said Danny. “We’ve been missing something, should\r\nhave taken a vacation down here every year.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! So you’re the son of a millionaire!” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Not quite. But if I worked hard all the year, guess I could make it.\r\nWhat do you say we try it after the war is over?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Swung Out Over the Sea Again]\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind if I do. But, Danny,” her voice hit a serious note, “did you\r\never think that war is not all a dead loss? Think of the boys who would\r\nhave grown up to sell socks, or run a streetcar or mend shoes—”\r\n\r\n“And never get twenty miles away from good old Chicago.”\r\n\r\n“And now they’re seeing the world, Africa, India, China, South Sea\r\nIslands. This country of ours will never be the same after the war.”\r\n\r\n“It sure won’t.”\r\n\r\nThey swung out over the sea again. Beneath them a large ship, under full\r\nsteam, was gliding out to sea.\r\n\r\n“Going out to make a secret meeting with other ships of a convoy,” Sally\r\nsaid. “Wonder how soon I’ll be sailing with that ship, or some other.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps never,” Danny replied soberly. “They haven’t said they’d take\r\nWAVES abroad yet. But I am about all set. Just a day or so more at the\r\nmost. They never tell us exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danny, no!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sally, yes!” he echoed. “What’s the matter? Want me to stay a\r\nlandlubber all my life?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. A small plane, darling through the air like a bird,\r\nhad caught her eye.\r\n\r\n“That’s your boss, Silent Storm,” Danny said. “When I learned he was\r\nyour boss, I sort of looked him up. The boys told me that was his plane.\r\nNo one else flies it.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a fine man, Danny.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what they all say. He was very badly shot up out there in the\r\nPacific. They didn’t expect him to live, but the nurses pulled him\r\nthrough—”\r\n\r\n“And now—”\r\n\r\n“Now he might be sitting in the sun, living on a pension.”\r\n\r\n“But who would want to in exciting times like these?”\r\n\r\n“Not your Silent Storm. He works harder than the rest of them.”\r\n\r\n“But, Danny! Look!” Her voice rose sharply. “Look at his plane!”\r\n\r\n“Acting crazy all right. Seems to be out of control.”\r\n\r\n“Danny! He said something strange once. He said he wouldn’t take other\r\npeople up because he wasn’t sure of himself. You don’t think—”\r\n\r\nDanny was thinking, and thinking fast. Advancing the throttle, he sent\r\nhis plane speeding toward the spot in the sky where the small plane was\r\ngoing through all the motions of a fighter shot out of the clouds.\r\n\r\n“He’s really going down,” he muttered grimly. “And ours is a land plane,\r\nworse luck.”\r\n\r\nThey remained at two thousand feet. Starting at that same level, the\r\nother plane had gone into a slow spiral and was slowly drifting down.\r\n\r\n“If he hits the water at that speed, he’s done,” Danny groaned. “Why in\r\nthe world doesn’t he bail out?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he can’t. He—he may be unconscious.” Sally gripped her hands\r\nuntil the nails cut deep into the flesh.\r\n\r\n“There!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“He’s getting control. He’s leveling off.” Danny spoke slowly. “But\r\nhe’ll crash all the same. And his plane is a land plane. Let’s hope he’s\r\na good swimmer.”\r\n\r\n“But he isn’t.” Sally’s words came quick and fast. “He used to be. The\r\nJaps wrecked his back.”\r\n\r\n“Tough luck!”\r\n\r\n“There! He’s down. His plane is still intact.”\r\n\r\n“It will sink all the same, in no time at all.”\r\n\r\n“Danny!” Sally gripped his arm tight. “Just circle over that spot,\r\nslowly.” She stood up.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going over the side. I’m a good swimmer, I can save him.”\r\n\r\n“Here—take the controls. I’ll go.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t fly a plane, never have.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, good girl! Here’s luck to you. Here, take this.” He dragged a\r\nrubber raft from beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nTucking the raft under her left arm and gripping the ripcord with her\r\nright hand, Sally opened the cabin door, stood there for a few seconds,\r\nand then she was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n                           SALLY SAVES A LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty seconds is not a lot of time but Sally had taken her chute\r\ntraining seriously. In just that many seconds she did several things.\r\nShe pulled her ripcord, waited breathless, then felt the pull of the\r\nopening chute.\r\n\r\nFinding that she was facing the wind, she turned herself about. Looking\r\ndown, she judged that she would hit the water only fifty yards or so\r\nfrom Major Storm’s rapidly vanishing plane. Catching the raft by its\r\nedges she held it before her and waited. Ten seconds later, as the\r\nlapping waves reached for her, she did a sort of swan dive and landed\r\nflat with the raft beneath her.\r\n\r\n“Four-point landing.” She laughed in spite of the seriousness of the\r\nsituation, freeing herself from her parachute harness.\r\n\r\nRearing up on her elbows, she looked for the plane.\r\n\r\n“Gone!” she cried in dismay.\r\n\r\nJust then she saw a hand go up. Silent Storm was doing his best.\r\n\r\nThrowing herself flat on the raft and using her hands for paddles, she\r\nthrew all her strength into an effort to reach him.\r\n\r\nEven so, weakened by his efforts and the pain his back gave him, he had\r\ngone down once before she reached him.\r\n\r\nA brief struggle followed, and then he lay on the raft and stared up at\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n“You—you shouldn’t have done it.” He talked with difficulty. “I’m\r\nreally not worth it. Shouldn’t have gone up. But flying somehow gets\r\ninto your blood.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” she replied quietly. “It’s all right. I wouldn’t have missed\r\nthis for anything. Somehow I thought that parachuting was a good thing\r\nto know. Now I’m sure of it. You’ll be fine when you get your breath.\r\nDanny will send out a motorboat.”\r\n\r\nThey were both wet to the skin. That didn’t matter too much. There was a\r\nwarm land breeze from the shore. Stripping off their sodden jackets,\r\nthey allowed their thin cotton shirts to bag and flutter in the breeze.\r\n\r\n“I’ve often dreamed of being on the sea in one of these rubber rafts,”\r\nhe mused. “Men have lived in them for weeks.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be bad if the weather were always like this.” She leaned\r\nback in lazy comfort.\r\n\r\n“It’s rather rough on me, this experience,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad you lost your plane.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! It’s not that. I could buy another. Thing is, I’ve really proved to\r\nmyself that I’m no good for flying. I went out cold right up in the air.\r\nI came out of it in time to save myself, but not my ship. Even so, if it\r\nhadn’t been for you I’d have drowned.”\r\n\r\n“You’re too important to be taking such needless chances.” There was a\r\nnote of kindness in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I suppose you’re right, but I have so wanted to be back there in\r\nthe islands with my friends, fighting it out with those unspeakable\r\nJaps. I kept sort of kidding myself along, but now—”\r\n\r\n“Now you know the truth and the truth shall make you free.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! So you’re a preacher?” He laughed good-naturedly. “Well, I don’t\r\nmind. What’s the rest of the sermon?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to make new friends where you are. You’ve made some\r\nalready. I am one of them, ‘one of the least of these.’”\r\n\r\n“Far from that. One of the greatest. I prize your friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“But you have asked to be sent away, on a ship.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come back, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.” His voice rose. “I meant to tell you. It’s more than half\r\narranged already. There’s a new type of fighting ship going out with a\r\nconvoy in a day or two. She’s a small airplane carrier built specially\r\nfor convoy duty.\r\n\r\n“But,” he hastened to add, “you’ll not whisper a word of this.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not.”\r\n\r\nTo herself she thought: “That must be Danny’s ship. Wouldn’t it be\r\nwonderful if I were to sail on his ship!”\r\n\r\nThis hope was lost for the time, at least, for Storm went on: “This is\r\nthe ship’s maiden voyage. She will carry a crew, all men. But if all\r\ngoes well on the following trip it is planned to use some women nurses\r\nand a number of WAVES for secretarial work, storekeepers, radio and\r\ncommunications.”\r\n\r\n“A testing trip?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I have already put in a word for you. I hated that for I\r\nwanted both Nancy and yourself on my own force. But there’s that secret\r\nradio.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there’s the radio,” she agreed with enthusiasm. “We’ll work it out\r\ntogether. I have two sets. I’ve already written C. K. asking permission\r\nto leave one with you in case I am sent across. That way, we can try it\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“It’s good of you to suggest it, but don’t hope for too much. There is a\r\nlot of radio silence when you’re on convoy duty. It’s necessary, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it,” she exclaimed. “If we get in a really tight place and\r\ndon’t dare use the regular radio we can switch to our secret radio. You\r\ncould stand by with your set at regular hours, couldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s all arranged. Don’t you see, if you and I can work out this\r\nsecret radio, if it turns out to be a really big thing, it will make up\r\nfor the other things you want to do and can’t!”\r\n\r\n“You’re wonderful!” he exclaimed. “We’ll do things together!”\r\n\r\n“Look!” she exclaimed. “Here’s a small flashlight attached to the boat,\r\nyes, and a fish line with artificial bait attached!”\r\n\r\n“We’re all set for a long sail,” he laughed. “At least the flashlight\r\nwill come in handy for signaling our rescuers. It’s getting dark.”\r\n\r\nSally tried the flashlight. It worked. The line and tackle too was tried\r\nand with rather startling results.\r\n\r\nAfter unwinding the line Sally propped herself up on her knees, then\r\ngave the bright nickel spinner a fling well out over the dusky blue\r\nwaters. She drew it in, slowly at first, then faster and faster.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he murmured. “I see you are a fisherman.”\r\n\r\n“Not an expert,” was her modest comment, “My father loves to fish. I go\r\nwith him to the lakes sometimes. We cast for pike and bass and sometimes\r\na big land-locked salmon.”\r\n\r\n“Then there’s a battle.”\r\n\r\n“A wonderful battle. I love it!”\r\n\r\nShe gave the spinner one more fling, this time far out from the boat.\r\nScarcely had she begun speeding up her pull, when suddenly she all but\r\npitched head foremost into the sea.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” he exclaimed, seizing her by the waist and pulling her back. “Not\r\nso fast!”\r\n\r\n“He—help!” she exclaimed. “I’ve got something big!”\r\n\r\nReaching around her he grasped the line and together they pulled.\r\n\r\n“Now!” he breathed. “I’ll pull and you roll in the line. Now!”\r\n\r\nHe heaved away and she rolled line. The fish came, sometimes slowly,\r\nsometimes faster. A quarter of the line was in, half, two thirds, and\r\nthen—\r\n\r\n“Oh! Give him line!” she exclaimed. “He’ll have us both in the water.”\r\n\r\nThey gave him line, then started pulling in. Three times this was\r\nrepeated. At last, apparently worn-out, the fish came all the way in.\r\n\r\n“Give us a light,” Storm said, as the fish came close to the boat.\r\n“Let’s see what we have.” She switched on the small flashlight. “Ah! A\r\nsmall tuna! A beauty!” he breathed. “We must have him.”\r\n\r\n“A small one!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps twenty pounds.”\r\n\r\n“How big is a big one?”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred pounds is a nice size. We—”\r\n\r\n“Watch out!” His words rang out sharply.\r\n\r\nShe dodged back. There had been a sudden white flash in the water. Then\r\nthe line gave a great yank.\r\n\r\n“A shark! A bad one!” he exclaimed again. “He got our fish—”\r\n\r\n“No, the fish is still there. Pull him in quick!”\r\n\r\nThe fish came flapping into the boat.\r\n\r\n“All here but the tail,” was his comment. “Baked tuna is not half bad.\r\nWe’ll have a feast.”\r\n\r\nFor a time after that they sat watching the waters.\r\n\r\nThe shark did not return. The night really settled down. The city’s\r\nlights painted a many-colored picture against the wall of darkness\r\nbeyond, and all was still.\r\n\r\nOut of that stillness came the chug-chug of a motorboat.\r\n\r\n“They’re coming for us,” she said huskily. She did not know whether to\r\nbe glad or sorry.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to have been with you,” he said when, an hour later, he let\r\nher out of a taxi at her hotel door. “Thanks for saving my life and all\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“It’s been fun,” she said. “It really has. Think I’ll resign from the\r\nWAVES and join the life guards.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” he exclaimed, with one foot on the running board. “Don’t\r\nforget we have one more dinner date. Our tuna catch must be honored.\r\nShall we say tomorrow evening?”\r\n\r\n“That will be fine.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s a date.”\r\n\r\n“If I hear from C. K. and have his permission,” she added, “I’ll bring\r\nover the secret radio.”\r\n\r\n“Good! You can give me a few lessons regarding its operation.”\r\n\r\n“And we’ll have a listen-in at the sub wolf-packs.”\r\n\r\n“If that’s what it is. And here’s hoping.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s hoping!”\r\n\r\n“Good night!”\r\n\r\n“Good night!” His taxi rolled away.\r\n\r\n“It’s a strange world,” she thought as she walked up the marble steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n                             SECRET MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks later Sally was again on those fine waters. Again it was\r\nnight. Once more the city painted its many colored pictures against the\r\nsky. But how strangely different was the craft on which she rode!\r\n\r\nGone was the small rubber raft, the tuna, and the shark. Gone too was\r\nstrange, intriguing Silent Storm.\r\n\r\n“It will be a long time before I see him again,” she told herself, “but\r\nI may talk to him, perhaps many times.”\r\n\r\nThis was true. During the weeks that had just passed she had secured\r\npermission from her aged benefactor, the radio inventor, C. K., to show\r\nthe secret radio to Silent Storm.\r\n\r\nShe had taken it to his house for the first time on the night of the\r\ntuna feast. That feast had been a great success. Nancy had gone with\r\nher. Never had she seen Silent Storm so carefree and gay as on that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhen the feast was over, the three of them, Sally, Nancy, and Silent\r\nStorm, had retired to his den. There the secret radio was set up. Since\r\nhe had a private hook-up with the station’s great aerial, things had\r\ngone very well.\r\n\r\nFor a time, it is true, no sound came over that secret wave length, but\r\nthis had happened many times before. When at last the “put-put-put”\r\nbegan, the strange broadcasters had put on a real show. As on one other\r\noccasion the six separate units broadcasting were some distance apart.\r\n\r\nThen came the sudden, loud and insistent bark of a broadcast for all the\r\nworld like the call of a wolf leader to his pack.\r\n\r\n“A call to the kill,” Sally had thought to herself. She was thrilled to\r\nthe very center of her being, but said never a word. She wanted Silent\r\nStorm to listen and form his own opinions.\r\n\r\nSlowly, surely, quite like the wolves of the Great White North, the\r\nbroadcasters drew closer and closer together.\r\n\r\n“Closing in on the prey.” Scarcely could she avoid speaking aloud.\r\n\r\nThen came the loud, irregular barks of apparent command.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when all this excitement was over and the broadcasters\r\nbegan to separate there were only five. One had gone silent.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Silent Storm, mopping his brow, “is one of the strangest\r\nthings I ever heard.”\r\n\r\n“Is it an enemy sub wolf-pack?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“It would be only one other thing,” Storm spoke slowly. “It could be a\r\nflight of our bombers concentrating on a target and then delivering\r\ntheir cargoes of death and destruction.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Sally agreed, “the broadcasts fit that picture quite as well.”\r\n\r\n“We can only wait and see,” said Storm. “We must do all we can to get\r\nNancy and you on a ship at the earliest possible moment.”\r\n\r\nNancy seemed a bit startled by this, but Sally said: “That will be\r\nswell!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “It Could Be a Flight of Our Bombers.”]\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Storm, “when you are on a ship you are constantly\r\nchanging your position. Once you are at the center of the Atlantic, if\r\nthese secret broadcasters put on a show like this for you, and if it is\r\nnorth, south, or west of you, you’ll know at once that they are subs and\r\nnot bombers.\r\n\r\n“And then!” he struck the table a blow, “then we’ll go after them. Last\r\nyear we lost twelve million tons of shipping to those wolf-packs. Think\r\nof it! A million tons a month. That might mean the losing of the war.\r\n\r\n“But with this secret radio of yours, if things are as we suppose them\r\nto be, what we won’t do to those inhuman beasts who have machine-gunned\r\nmen struggling in the water and women on rafts!”\r\n\r\nAfter that night, Sally had waited, impatiently, for the return of\r\nDanny’s ship. Then one day she met Danny on the street.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he whispered. “We are safely back. She’s a grand, old ship. I got\r\na sub.”\r\n\r\n“Danny! Good for you!” She wanted to hug him right there on the street.\r\n\r\n“We’re sailing tomorrow night with a fresh convoy,” he confided, “and\r\nI’ve been told you are to sail with us.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“And now, here I am,” Sally thought as she watched the city’s lights\r\nfade while they sailed out into the dark, mysterious night.\r\n\r\nShe was standing on a great, flat, top deck. Nancy was at her side, a\r\ndim shadow. Larger shadows, that were airplanes, loomed at their backs.\r\nNo lights were showing. The radio was silent. They were alone on the\r\nsea. And yet there was to be a convoy.\r\n\r\n“That will come later,” Lieutenant Riggs, radio officer for their\r\nflat-top, told her. “The ships of our convoy come from many places,\r\nBoston, New York, Portland, even San Francisco. Someone stuck a pin in a\r\nmap. The spot is right out there in the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Our secret meeting place.” Sally wet her lips. It was all so strange.\r\n\r\n“It’s all of that,” was the quiet response. “And it better be mighty\r\nsecret at that. Forty ships, all loaded, food, airplanes, soldiers.\r\nThere are even a hundred WACS going over in one of those ships.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred WACS,” Sally thought as she caught the last spark of light\r\nfrom the shore. There were twelve WAVES on this airplane carrier, and\r\nthey weren’t just going over, but over and back. There were six women\r\nnurses as well. This was to be a trial trip.\r\n\r\n“I hope we make good,” she had said to Lieutenant Riggs.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will. I can see it in your eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Will we make good?” she asked Nancy.\r\n\r\n“We’ll do our best,” was the solemn reply. “But what about the secret\r\nradio?”\r\n\r\n“We can always listen for the subs. They can’t detect our listening.\r\nPerhaps that’s the most important of all.”\r\n\r\n“Silent Storm has the other set?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He’ll be standing by for a half hour in the morning and again at\r\nnight. In an emergency, the secret radio might help. Other than that,\r\nsilence is the order of the day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, subs have ears,” Nancy agreed. “Loose talk may sink a ship.”\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to have Danny on the ship.”\r\n\r\n“Which do you like best, Danny or Storm?” Nancy asked.\r\n\r\n“I like them both, but in different ways. Storm is like a big brother.\r\nHe helps a lot. Danny’s just a very nice boy.”\r\n\r\n“And really nice boys are about the nicest creatures in the world.”\r\nNancy laughed low.\r\n\r\n“I’m going below for a few winks of sleep.” Sally turned away. “There’ll\r\nbe work to do later.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t sleep now. It’s all too strange,” Nancy murmured, her eyes\r\non the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed for this American girl it was strange. All her life she had\r\nbeen looked after, cared for. The things she wanted she got. She had\r\njoined the WAVES to do her bit but with the thought that she would\r\nremain in America. Now, caught up and carried on by Sally’s enthusiasm,\r\nshe had gone to sea. She had been told that theirs was to be a slow\r\nconvoy, that they would be twelve days at sea.\r\n\r\n“Twelve days,” she whispered, looking away at the dark waters of night.\r\n“Twelve nights.” Losses from sinking were greater in these days than\r\never before. She could swim, but shuddered at the thought of being\r\nthrown into those cold, black, miserable waters. How was it all to end?\r\n\r\n“Whatever happens, I’m in it to the end,” she had written her mother\r\njust before she sailed.\r\n\r\n“And that’s that,” she told herself stoutly as she turned to make her\r\nway down the ladder to the forward cabins on the deck below where the\r\nnurses and the WAVES had their quarters.\r\n\r\nFour hours later Sally found herself standing on the ship’s tower.\r\nBeside her stood Lieutenant Riggs. Riggs was a veteran ship’s radio\r\nengineer. No one seemed to know how old he was. He was tall, erect,\r\nevery inch a sailor. His steel gray hair told that he was not young. His\r\nsharp, darting eyes had told Sally that here was a man who would demand\r\nexactness of service and never-failing loyalty. And she loved him for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nShe was feeling a bit nervous, for this was to be her first testing at\r\nsea. They had arrived at the place of meeting, an unmarked spot in an\r\nendless sea, ahead of the other members of the convoy.\r\n\r\nJust a moment, before, she had caught a winking blink on the horizon.\r\n\r\n“There’s one, south southwest,” she had said to Riggs.\r\n\r\n“You have good eyes,” he commended. “Give them this message. See if they\r\nget it.”\r\n\r\nAs he read off the location the other ship was to take in relation to\r\nthe airplane carrier, she blinked it out in code with the aid of an\r\nelectric blinker, aimed like a gun at the other ship.\r\n\r\nThey waited. Then came the answering blinks.\r\n\r\n“They got it,” she said simply. “They will go at once to their\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” was his quiet reply.\r\n\r\nFor a full hour after that they stood there, he giving orders in a low\r\nmonotone and she blinking them across the waters to some newly-arrived\r\nship. As the work went forward, her heart swelled with pride. She was\r\npart of something really big. Great ships moved in on the dark horizon,\r\nships loaded with oil, airplanes, food, soldiers, everything that is\r\nvital to war. Like an usher in some great theater of the sea, she told\r\neach ship where its place was to be and it silently glided into\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“This,” she murmured, “is the life!”\r\n\r\n“You are doing very well,” was Riggs’s comment. “Not a mistake yet.”\r\n\r\nThere were no mistakes. When the last ship had taken its position, there\r\ncame low orders passed from man to man. Then they began moving on into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nStill Sally and Lieutenant Riggs held their places. One ship had\r\nforgotten or failed to receive the hour of departure. A question blinked\r\nto them was speedily answered. Then they too began to move.\r\n\r\nA half hour later a tanker lagging behind was ordered to put on more\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went until four hours were gone. Then Nancy appeared with a\r\nyoung lieutenant and Sally crept away to her quarters for more sleep.\r\n\r\n“How do you like it?” a gray-haired nurse with a kindly face asked.\r\n\r\n“Fine, so far,” was her answer. “Just swell. And so different!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s different all right. You might like to know,” the nurse’s\r\nvoice dropped to a whisper, “I’m Danny Duke’s mother.”\r\n\r\n“Danny’s mother!”\r\n\r\n“He told me about you and Nancy. He likes you.” The gray-haired woman\r\ngave her a fine smile.\r\n\r\n“And we like him. He caught me once, saved me from a broken leg or\r\nsomething,” was Sally’s reply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he told me about that.” She laughed. “Danny’s just a boy, you\r\nknow. He’s my only child. You won’t tell that I’m his mother?” she\r\nbegged. “It’s a bit irregular, my being on a ship with him. But I wanted\r\nit, so I told them if sons could sail the sea then mothers could, too.\r\nSo they took me on, just for this trip. It’s sort of a tryout for all of\r\nus, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. I won’t tell a soul. Thanks so much for telling me.” Sally\r\nmoved on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n                            THEY FLY AT DAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nSally awoke with a start. She had had a strange dream. In the dream\r\nthree of her best friends had stood by her berth looking down at her.\r\nThe older of the three said:\r\n\r\n“She won’t wake up in time.”\r\n\r\n“Not in time,” the next in line agreed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, she will!” the third exclaimed confidently.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m awake,” Sally thought. “Now I have all the bother of going\r\nback to sleep again.”\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, then opened them wide again. Through her eyelids\r\nshe had received an impression of red light.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, there it was. The cabin was dark but the faint red light was\r\nthere all the same.\r\n\r\n“My secret radio!” she thought. “I can’t have left it on!”\r\n\r\nShe propped herself on an elbow to peer into the darkness. She had left\r\nthe radio close to her berth, just in case—\r\n\r\nThere was no harm in that, for only Nancy slept in the berth above.\r\n\r\n“It’s on,” she thought. “I’m sure I turned it off.”\r\n\r\nThis was strange for Nancy had been fast asleep when she turned in.\r\nSally had tried picking up some sound of the “put-put-put-a-put” of the\r\nmysterious broadcasters and failed. Then she had—\r\n\r\nAt that her thoughts broke off short for, very faintly, because the\r\nradio was turned low, there came the familiar “put-put-put-put-a-put.”\r\n\r\n“I turned the radio on in my sleep,” she told herself. There seemed to\r\nbe no other possible conclusion, yet it seemed close to a miracle that\r\nshe had done so for, during the two preceding days, she had caught not\r\nthe faintest suggestion of a broadcast on her secret radio, and now,\r\nhere, in the middle of the night, it was coming in strong. Needless to\r\nsay, she listened with both her ears.\r\n\r\nFor two whole days she and Nancy, together with Riggs and the second\r\nradioman, had kept their convoy together, with blinker lights by night\r\nand flags by day. Not a sound had come from a radio on any ship of the\r\nconvoy. It had been one of the strangest experiences of Sally’s entire\r\nlife. To go to sleep at night after a look at dark bulks looming here\r\nand there on the horizon, and to wake up with those same ships in the\r\nidentical position in regard to one another, yet some hundreds of miles\r\non their way, had seemed unbelievable.\r\n\r\nBut now, here was the secret radio talking again. “This may be the\r\nhour,” she whispered excitedly as, having turned the dial, she listened\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\nSlipping from her berth, she drew on a heavy velvet dressing gown,\r\nturned the radio up a little, then sat there listening, turning a dial\r\nnow and then, listening some more and all the time growing more excited.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty minutes of listening her face took on a look of sheer\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n“I can’t do it,” she thought. “I may be court-martialed. But I must! I\r\nmust!”\r\n\r\nFor a full five minutes she sat there deep in perplexing thought. Having\r\nat last reached a decision, she went into action. After dressing\r\nhurriedly, she shut off the radio and disconnected its wires. Then,\r\nseizing it by the handle, she slipped out of the stateroom, glided along\r\none passageway after another to wind up at last in the radio room where\r\nLieutenant Riggs was standing watch alone.\r\n\r\n“Why! Hello, Sally!” Riggs exclaimed. “What’s up?” He glanced down at\r\nthe black box. “You’re not planning to leave the ship, I hope?” During\r\nthe days of fine sailing they had enjoyed together, since the start of\r\nthe convoy voyage, she and Riggs had become quite good friends.\r\n\r\nShe did not join in his laugh. Instead she said:\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Riggs, something terrible is happening. We are being\r\nsurrounded by an enemy wolf-pack of subs.”\r\n\r\n“Sally!” he exclaimed. “You’ve been having a bad dream. You’d better go\r\nback to bed.”\r\n\r\n“It’s no dream.” Her face was white. “It’s a terrible reality.”\r\n\r\n“But, Sally, how could you know that? The moon is down. The sky is\r\nblack. It’s three in the morning. You haven’t a radio and even I have\r\nheard nothing within a thousand miles—not that I can hear those\r\nwolves,” he added. “No, nor you either.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied in a hoarse whisper, “I do have a radio, and I can\r\nhear the sub wolf-pack, have been hearing them for half an hour.”\r\n\r\n“What!” He stared at her as if he thought her mad. Then his eyes fell on\r\nher black box. “What’s that thing?” he asked in a not unkindly voice.\r\n\r\n“It’s a secret radio.” She was ready to cry by now. “Sending and\r\nreceiving. There’s only one other like it in the world. Perhaps they’ll\r\ncourt-martial me for it. I know how strict the regulations are about\r\nradios.\r\n\r\n“But that does not matter now!” She squared her shoulders. “All that\r\nmatters now is that you connect up this radio, that you listen to it and\r\nbelieve what I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try.” He did not smile.\r\n\r\nIn no time at all the radio was hooked up and “put-putting” louder than\r\never.\r\n\r\n“That’s a sub giving orders to another sub,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he breathed.\r\n\r\n“Now watch. I turn this dial. That changes the direction of our\r\nlistening. And—” For a space of seconds there came no sound and then\r\nagain, “put-put-put....”\r\n\r\n“That’s a different sub, answering the first.” There was quiet\r\nconfidence in her voice. “It has a different sound.”\r\n\r\n“So it does,” he agreed.\r\n\r\nIn the next ten minutes, she located six different radios operating out\r\nthere, somewhere in the night.\r\n\r\n“There are two others” she said as she straightened up. “Eight in all.”\r\n\r\n“Eight,” he repeated after her.\r\n\r\n“They’re on every side of us,” she said quietly. “The direction from\r\nwhich the sound comes tells that.”\r\n\r\n“On every side of us.” Riggs seemed in a daze.\r\n\r\n“But you can’t know unless you’ve listened to them as I have.” She\r\ngripped his arm in her excitement. “They’re closing in on our convoy\r\nfrom all sides. Closing in for the kill.”\r\n\r\n“Closing in for the kill.” The Lieutenant spoke like one in a trance.\r\n“Thousands of lives, soldiers, nurses, WACs, airplanes, ammunition,\r\nfood—closing in for the kill.\r\n\r\n“Watch the radio!” he ordered. “I’ll be back with the Captain!”\r\n\r\n“The Captain! Oh! Oh! No!” she cried. But he was gone.\r\n\r\nTo say that Sally was frightened would not have expressed it at all. For\r\nsome time after Riggs left, she sat there shivering with fear.\r\n\r\nRiggs had gone for the Captain. Did that mean that he believed what she\r\nhad told him, or had he been shocked by the realization that she had\r\nlaid herself open to court-martial?\r\n\r\n“He’s gone for the Captain,” she told herself at last. “He’d never think\r\nof doing that, just to get me into deeper trouble. He’s not that kind of\r\na man.” At that she drew in three deep breaths and felt better.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone for the Captain,” she thought and shuddered. She had seen the\r\nCaptain on the bridge, that was all. He had seemed a fine figure of a\r\nman, the sort you saw on the bridge in movies, stern, unsmiling,\r\ninflexible. She shuddered again.\r\n\r\nBut here was Riggs and with him the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Miss Scott,” said Riggs, “will you kindly repeat your performance with\r\nthat, that radio, for the Captain’s benefit?”\r\n\r\nSally’s fingers trembled as she turned on the radio. Noting this, the\r\nCaptain said:\r\n\r\n“As you were.” His dark eyes twinkled as he added: “We’re not ’angin’\r\nDanny Deever in the mornin’.”\r\n\r\n“So the Captain has a sense of humor,” the girl thought and at once felt\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\nNot only did she repeat the demonstration she had put on for Riggs, but\r\nfor a full half hour she turned dials bringing in first this\r\nbroadcaster, then another, and, at the same time, demonstrating by\r\ncircles and angles that they were moving in, closer, ever closer, to the\r\nconvoy.\r\n\r\nNot this alone, but in her eagerness to be understood and trusted, she\r\ntold the whole story of the secret radio and the experiments that had\r\nbeen carried on from the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Riggs, I’m Convinced!” the Captain Declared]\r\n\r\n“Riggs, I’m convinced!” the Captain declared at last. “They will strike\r\nat dawn. In a half hour our men will be ordered to battle stations.\r\nTwenty minutes before dawn ten planes will leave the ship to scour the\r\nsea. At the same time half our destroyers will take up the search.\r\n\r\n“Miss Scott, I salute you.” He clicked his heels. Instantly Sally was on\r\nher feet with a true sailor’s salute.\r\n\r\n“They believe me,” she thought as the pair left the radio cabin. “By\r\nrights I should want to shout or burst into tears.” She wanted to do\r\nneither, just felt cold and numb, that was all.\r\n\r\nThen, as red blood flooded back to her cheeks and she thought of\r\nfighting planes and destroyers shooting away before dawn, practically at\r\nher command, she suddenly felt like Joan of Arc or Helen of Troy.\r\n\r\nThen a terrible thought assailed her. What if it were all a mistake?\r\nOnly time could answer that question, time and the dawn. “They fly at\r\ndawn,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nJust then someone entered the cabin. It was Nancy.\r\n\r\n“Sally,” she exclaimed. “Why are you here? This is not your watch. I\r\nwoke up and missed you. What have you been doing?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty,” said Sally. “Sit down and I’ll tell you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n                           AMONG THE MISSING\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently Riggs came hurrying back. Nancy and Sally remained in the\r\nradio room, dividing their time between listening for messages from the\r\noutside world, and watching with awe the ever-narrowing circle being\r\ndrawn about the convoy by the enemy sub pack.\r\n\r\nRiggs busied himself getting off messages from station to station on the\r\nship. All men were ordered to their posts. Planes not in readiness were\r\nprepared for flight. Some were hoisted from the lower deck to flight\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n“It’s like a calm before a terrible storm,” Nancy said to Sally. Soon\r\nenough they were to learn what an actual storm could mean to a convoy at\r\nsea. For the present, however, there was quite enough to occupy their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nOnce, when Sally climbed the ladder to the flight deck for a breath of\r\nair, she chanced to bump into Danny Duke.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danny!” she exclaimed. “Must you go out?” He was garbed in flying\r\ntogs. A parachute hung at his back.\r\n\r\n“Sure!” He laughed. “What do you think I trained for? A game of\r\nvolleyball?”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t think. She just didn’t want anyone she liked as well as Danny\r\nto be out there fighting subs, dodging antiaircraft fire and watching\r\nthe black sea that waited to swallow him up.\r\n\r\nAt last, as dawn approached and a young officer came to take her place,\r\nSally closed up her black box, removed the wires and marched away to\r\nstore it under her berth.\r\n\r\n“Stay there a while,” she whispered, “until we know whether you mean\r\nhonor or disaster for me.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a sober face that she returned to the flight deck. She found\r\nthe planes that were to go all in place, their motors turning over\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nShe caught a quick breath as the first plane took off; then the second\r\nand third had whirled away when a hand waved to her as a voice shouted:\r\n\r\n“Hi, Sally! See you later!”\r\n\r\nIt was Danny. In ten seconds he was not there.\r\n\r\n“Gone! Just like that.” She swallowed hard to keep back the tears.\r\n\r\n“Yes, just like that,” came in a quiet voice. Sally turned to find\r\nDanny’s mother standing beside her.\r\n\r\n“Tha—that was Danny,” Sally murmured hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was my boy, Danny.”\r\n\r\n“Did—did you want him to go?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course, my child. He’s well prepared, Danny is. It’s the work he was\r\ntrained to do. Our country is at war. We must all do our part.” The\r\nmother’s eyes were bright, but no tears gleamed there.\r\n\r\n“It’s so much easier to dream of war than it is to see it, feel it, and\r\nbe a part of it,” Sally murmured.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dreams are often more pleasing than the realities of life,”\r\nDanny’s mother agreed.\r\n\r\nSally stood where she was. There was comfort to be had from communing\r\nwith this big, motherly woman, comfort and peace. And just then she was\r\ngreatly in need of peace, for she was being weighed in the balance. The\r\nnext few moments would decide everything. And so she stood there waiting\r\nfor the answer.\r\n\r\nAnd then the answer came, a deep-toned muffled roar, that seemed to\r\nshake the sea.\r\n\r\n“They’ve found them,” Mrs. Duke said. “That’s a bomb.”\r\n\r\n“They were there. They’ve found them!” Sally wanted to shout for joy.\r\nShe said never a word, just stood there thinking: “Good old C. K. will\r\nbe famous because of his secret radio. I won’t be court-martialed and\r\nthrown out of service for bringing it on board. Perhaps it has saved the\r\nconvoy from attack, may save it again and again. Glory! Glory!”\r\n\r\nJust then there came another roar. This was followed by a series of\r\npom-pom-poms.\r\n\r\n“That’s antiaircraft fire,” said Danny’s mother.\r\n\r\n“Does it come from our destroyers?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“No. We are the ones who have airplanes, not they. Besides, our guns on\r\nthe destroyers don’t sound like that. You’ll hear them. There! There’s\r\none now!”\r\n\r\nThere had come a boom that seemed to roll away to sea. There was another\r\nand another.\r\n\r\nAll this time, for all the world as if they were anchored in some\r\nharbor, the forty ships laden with freight and human cargo kept their\r\nplaces and moved majestically forward.\r\n\r\n“It’s beautiful,” Danny’s mother murmured.\r\n\r\n“And terrible!” Sally added with a sigh.\r\n\r\nSoon from all sides there came the roar of bombs, the pom-pom-pom of\r\nantiaircraft fire, and all the time Sally was thinking: “Danny! Oh,\r\nDanny!”\r\n\r\nAnd what of Danny? Having been told the course he should take, he had\r\ngone gliding straight away toward his supposed objective. Nor did he\r\nmiss it. Feeling safe in their false security, the eight enemy\r\nsubmarines on the surface had come gliding silently toward the\r\napparently defenseless convoy.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of Danny’s roaring motor, the sub he had been sent to\r\ndestroy crashdived, but too late. Swooping low, Danny released a bomb\r\nwith unerring accuracy. It missed them by feet, but when it exploded it\r\nbrought the sub to the surface with a rush and roar of foam.\r\n\r\nBy the time Danny could swing back, three of the enemy had manned an\r\nantiaircraft gun, but, nothing daunted, Danny again swung low and this\r\ntime he did not miss. His bomb fell squarely on the ill-fated craft and\r\nit exploded with a terrific roar.\r\n\r\nBut before this could happen, the antiaircraft gun had put a shell\r\nsquarely through the body of Danny’s plane, ripping the radio away,\r\ndamaging the plane’s controls, and missing sending Danny to oblivion by\r\nonly a foot or two.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Danny, as if talking of someone other than himself, “was\r\nyour closest miss. Another time, they’d get you. But that other time\r\nwon’t be—ever. So how about getting back to the ship?” Yes, how? His\r\nmotor was missing, and his controls stuck at every turn.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime three planes came zooming back. Anxiously Sally waited\r\nas the landing crews made them fast. Danny’s plane was not among them.\r\n\r\nOne plane, a two-seated dive-bomber, had been shot up. Its pilot was\r\nwounded. Mrs. Duke went away to care for him.\r\n\r\nThe other two planes remained on board just long enough to take on more\r\nbombs. Then they were off again.\r\n\r\nCatching Sally’s eye, the Captain motioned her to join him at the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n“It’s marvelous!” he told her. “That secret radio of yours has saved\r\nships and lives. Eight subs all ready to pounce on us and now look—” He\r\nswung his arm in a broad circle taking in all the gliding ships.\r\n\r\nThis was high praise. Sally’s bosom swelled with pride. Then—\r\n\r\n“Danny?” she said without thinking.\r\n\r\n“What about Danny?” He laughed. “Hell be back with the rest. A fine boy.\r\nDanny. There are few better. We need a lot of Dannys in this war.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes, a lot of Dannys, but there’s only one,” she replied\r\nabsent-mindedly.\r\n\r\nShe left the bridge to wander back to the deck. One more badly crippled\r\nplane made a try for the deck, but missed and fell into the sea.\r\n\r\nA line was thrown to the pilot and he was pulled on board.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Danny?” she asked as the man came up dripping wet.\r\n\r\n“Dan-Danny?” he sputtered, coughing up salt water. “Why yes, once. He\r\nwas after a sub. Got him, I guess. But there were the AA guns, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nYes, Sally knew. She had heard them. Her heart ached at the thought of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOther planes came in. Had they seen Danny?\r\n\r\n“No Danny.”\r\n\r\nWere they going out again?\r\n\r\nOrders were not to go. All subs had been accounted for. Looked as if a\r\nfog would blow in any time. It had been a grand day.\r\n\r\nAt last all planes were in but one, and that was Danny’s.\r\n\r\nThen came the fog. Drifting in from the north, where fogs are born, it\r\nhid every ship of the convoy from Sally’s view.\r\n\r\nTurning, she walked bravely along the deck, climbed down the ladder,\r\nentered her room, threw herself on her berth, and sobbed her heart out\r\nto an empty world.\r\n\r\nFinally, she sat up resolutely, and her eyes fell on the secret radio.\r\nHere was an idea, perhaps a way out. Danny was out there on the sea. He\r\nmust be. His plane carried a rubber raft. She would not give up hope.\r\nThey were not yet too far from shore for heavy searching planes to reach\r\nthe spot. She would get their location. Then she would radio to Silent\r\nStorm. He’d send out a plane, a dozen big planes from the shore. They\r\ncould not fail to find Danny.\r\n\r\nYes, she would get Storm tonight on the secret radio. But dared she do\r\nit? Her splendid body went limp at the thought. This was a terrible\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n                          THE CAPTAIN’S DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening at the hour when Silent Storm had promised to be waiting at\r\nhis Florida airport to receive any urgent message Sally might send,\r\nSally sat alone in her cabin. Her fingers were on the dial, headphones\r\nover her ears, speaker under her chin.\r\n\r\n“I will,” she whispered. “I must. It’s for the best pal I ever had, for\r\nDanny.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet, she hesitated. It was very still in the cabin. There was only\r\nthe faint sound of water rushing along the ship’s side. The thin fog\r\ncontinued. The convoy moved majestically on. Everyone said they had won\r\na marvelous victory. Five, perhaps six submarines had been destroyed. No\r\none could tell for sure about the other two. That her secret radio had\r\nplayed a major role in this victory she knew quite well. With her help,\r\nthis radio with its gleaming red eyes had put out long fingers and\r\ntouched the subs here, there, and everywhere. Then those brave boys in\r\ntheir planes had gone out and destroyed them.\r\n\r\n“Danny got one. And then—” She did not finish.\r\n\r\nShe could not.\r\n\r\nShe started as there came a knock at her door. After hastily throwing a\r\nblanket over the radio, she said:\r\n\r\n“Come in.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened. “Oh! Mrs. Duke!” she exclaimed. “I’m glad you came.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you might need me,” The words were spoken in a surprisingly\r\ncalm voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I-”\r\n\r\nSally lifted the blanket from the radio.\r\n\r\n“That’s good! It’s a fine and noble gesture.” Danny’s mother took a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n“It—it’s not just a gesture!” the girl exclaimed. “It’s the realest\r\nthing I ever thought of doing in all my life!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you must not do it. You must not send the message.”\r\n\r\n“It’s for Danny, your son, my friend and pal!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Danny is my son.” The gray-haired woman spoke slowly. “My only\r\nson—he—he’s been my life. But you must not send that message. It would\r\nalmost surely mean court-martial for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—I know. I don’t care.” Sally’s hand was on the dial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Thought You Might Need Me,” She Said]\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. You would sacrifice your freedom and your honor for Danny.\r\nThat is noble. I would do the same and much more.\r\n\r\n“But there are others to consider.” The woman’s voice sounded tired. “So\r\nmany others! There are more soldiers in this convoy than we know about,\r\nthousands of them! They too are fine young men, just as fine as our\r\nDanny. They too are prepared to sacrifice their lives for their country.\r\nIt would be tragic if their lives were wasted.”\r\n\r\n“But our boys destroyed those submarines!”\r\n\r\n“Not all of them, not for sure, and there are other enemy wolf-packs.\r\nThere were never as many as now. We know that they use the same\r\nwave-length as your radio does. They will hear your message and will\r\nhunt us down.”\r\n\r\n“We will be listening, Nancy and I, night and day. Let them come! Our\r\nairplanes will destroy them!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, perhaps not. The weather may not be right for flying. And\r\nthen, try to think what it might be like.”\r\n\r\n“But Danny?” The words came in a whisper that was like a prayer.\r\n\r\n“Danny is alive. I feel sure of that. He’s on his rubber raft. The sea\r\nis calm.”\r\n\r\n“But it may storm.”\r\n\r\n“God will look after Danny. You believe in God’s care for his children,\r\ndon’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know. I’ve never been able to think that through.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll have to trust Danny’s mother.” Mrs. Duke smiled a rare\r\nsmile. “The time may come when Danny will mean more to you than he does\r\nto me. When that time comes, I shan’t mind. You are a splendid young\r\nlady. But until that time I shall have the right to say: ‘Sally, don’t\r\nsend that message.’”\r\n\r\n“All right.” Sally went limp all over. “You win.”\r\n\r\nA moment later, after giving herself a shake, she stood up. “I’ll put\r\nthe radio away. There’ll be no more subs for a time. Nancy and I have\r\nbeen invited by the Captain to have our evening meal with him at the\r\nofficers’ table.”\r\n\r\n“That’s splendid!” Mrs. Duke stood up. “You’ll enjoy it. You’re a real\r\nhero.”\r\n\r\n“Will I? Am I?” Sally asked these questions of herself after Danny’s\r\nmother had gone. She did not know the answers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDanny’s mother was right. For the moment at least, Danny was safe and\r\nquite comfortable. After battling his half-wrecked plane to a point\r\nwhere further struggle and loss of altitude might prove fatal, he gave\r\nup the fight and, circling down, went in for a crash landing.\r\n\r\nHis was as successful as any crash landing can be. Between the time he\r\nhit the water and his plane sank he was able to inflate his rubber raft,\r\nlook into its equipment, and even salvage a heavy leather coat he\r\ncarried for an emergency.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he accomplished this and paddled a short distance, when the\r\nplane put its nose into the water, stood there quivering, then\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\n“Good old plane,” he murmured, as a strange feeling of loneliness swept\r\nover him. “You did your full duty. You sank a sub and probably saved a\r\nship. Now, in Davy Jones’s Locker, you can rest in peace.\r\n\r\n“Looks as if I’d get some rest, too,” he thought as, a short time later,\r\nhe settled back against the soft, rounded side of his raft.\r\n\r\n“A good, long rest,” he added as a cool damp mist, touched his cheek and\r\nthe chill, gray fog came drifting in.\r\n\r\nWhen he first hit the water the boom, bang and rat-tat-tat of battle\r\nwere still in the air. After that had come comparative silence,\r\ndisturbed only by the low roar of planes returning to their ship.\r\n\r\n“A fine bunch of fellows,” he thought, as a lump rose in his throat.\r\n“Finest ever. Here’s hoping they all land safely.”\r\n\r\nA faint hope remained that one of those planes would get away to search\r\nfor him. When the fog came in he knew that hope was at an end.\r\n\r\nHe found the silence, broken only by the lap-lap of little waves,\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n“Going to be lonesome,” he thought as he started to examine the gadgets\r\nthat came with the rubber raft. There was a fish line and some\r\nartificial bait.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try them all out,” he chuckled. “If I catch a whopper with one of\r\nthe lures, I’ll send the manufacturer a picture of it with a story.\r\nHe’ll like it for his catalogue.\r\n\r\n“Only I won’t,” he murmured a moment later. “They forgot to pack a\r\ncandid camera.”\r\n\r\nInstead of a camera he found a device for distilling fresh water from\r\nsalt, some iron rations, and a small bottle of vitamin B1.\r\n\r\n“What? No vitamin D?” he roared. “But then, I’ve heard that there’s lots\r\nof the sunshine vitamin in the ocean air.”\r\n\r\nAt that he settled back for a rest. Even if worse came to worst he was\r\nbetter off than those wolf-pack pirates who had come after them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of misgiving that Sally allowed herself, along\r\nwith Nancy, to be led to the door of the officers’ mess hall that\r\nevening. But when the Captain met them at the door with a bow and a\r\nsmile instead of a stiff salute, things began looking better.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the mess hall they found all of the officers standing in\r\ntheir places. When the Captain had escorted them to their places at the\r\nhead of his table he stood smartly erect, every inch a commander, as he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I propose a salute to the ladies of the day, Sally Scott and\r\nNancy McBride of the WAVES.”\r\n\r\nInstantly every man stood erect and snapped to a salute. It was a simple\r\nand impressive ceremony, one long to be remembered, but to Sally’s utter\r\nconfusion, she almost forgot to return the salute.\r\n\r\nIt was all over in twenty seconds of time. Then they were all seated in\r\ntheir places ready for the meal that was to be quite a feast, in\r\ncelebration of a real victory.\r\n\r\nThere was fried chicken with cranberry sauce, and sweet potatoes, fresh,\r\ncrisp celery, and baked squash. All this was topped with ice cream and\r\nvery fine coffee.\r\n\r\nWas Sally conscious of all this wealth of good things? Well, hardly. She\r\nwas, first of all, tremendously interested in Captain Donald MacQueen\r\nwho sat at her side. All her life she had dreamed of really knowing\r\ngreat and important people. Not that she wished to brag about it, far\r\nfrom that. She did long for an opportunity to study them, to feel their\r\ngreatness, to try to absorb some of the qualities that had made them\r\ngreat. Now just such a man was giving the major portion of his time to\r\nher for one blissful half hour. A young lieutenant had taken over the\r\ntask of entertaining Nancy, and he did not seem at all unhappy about it\r\neither.\r\n\r\nImportant to Sally also were the things Captain MacQueen was saying to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“This old friend of yours—his name is Kennedy, I believe—must be a\r\ngreat genius,” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he is!” she beamed.\r\n\r\n“But it does seem strange that he should have entrusted such a priceless\r\ndevice to a, well, to any young person.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it may seem that way to you,” was her slow reply, “but, Captain\r\nMacQueen, I think that too often those who boast of gray hairs\r\nunderestimate the dependability, the devotion, yes, and the wisdom of\r\nthe young people of today—and—and,” she checked herself, “I have\r\nworked with him for six years.”\r\n\r\n“Everything you say is true.” His dark eyes twinkled. “But such a\r\npriceless invention! Look what it has accomplished today—given us a\r\nclean-cut victory, perhaps saved hundreds of lives and very precious\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\n“Miss Scott,” he leaned close, speaking low, “this is one of the most\r\nimportant convoys ever to cross the Atlantic. Our enemy is not through.\r\nHe will attack again and yet again, perhaps. But if we can always know,\r\nas we did today, the hour, the very moment of his attack—what a boon!”\r\n\r\n“C. K. Kennedy is a very old man.” She was speaking slowly again, “He is\r\nan extremely modest man. In the case of another important invention he\r\nmet with disappointment. I am sure he did not realize the real value of\r\nthis secret radio.”\r\n\r\n“But now he shall know. He shall be richly rewarded. Of course the\r\ngovernment will want to take over his invention, but even so—”\r\n\r\n“He does not ask for reward, only recognition.”\r\n\r\n“He shall have both, and in good measure,” the Captain declared. “And\r\nnow, let’s talk for a little while about the radio that is in your\r\nstateroom right now.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” Sally thought, with a sharp intake of breath, “now it is coming!”\r\n\r\n“Of course, you realize, Miss Scott,” he said, speaking low but\r\ndistinctly, “that for the present and probably for a long time to come,\r\nyour radio has value to the Navy only as a listening ear.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied quite frankly. “I’m not sure of that. It works quite\r\nwell as a sending set.”\r\n\r\n“In bringing such a radio on board you must have realized that you were\r\nlaying yourself open to serious charges.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why did you do it?” His words were spoken in a tone that betrayed\r\nonly a kindly interest.\r\n\r\n“Because I believed the radio to be a great invention, one that could be\r\nmade to serve my country, and because I wanted to bring honor to a real\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“You did not really mean to try communicating with anyone on land?” he\r\nasked in a quiet tone.\r\n\r\n“Only in case of a great emergency, and then only with an officer.” Her\r\nvoice was low.\r\n\r\n“I can think of no emergency that would warrant the sending of such a\r\nmessage. The truth is that such a message would be almost certain to\r\nbring in one more sub wolf-pack to hunt us down.\r\n\r\n“That is not all.” He was still speaking in a low, friendly voice. “The\r\nmoment our enemy realizes that we are able to listen in on his talk from\r\nsub to sub, that moment your radio loses its value. Think what it will\r\nmean if the escorting vessel in every convoy should be able in the\r\nfuture to listen as we did today while the wolf-pack moves in!”\r\n\r\n“I-I have thought.” Sally wet her dry lips. “I shall not attempt to\r\ncontact anyone with my radio, unless you sanction it—not—” she\r\nswallowed hard, “not for anything.”\r\n\r\n“That is being a good sailor.” Putting out a hand he said: “It will be a\r\npleasure to shake the hand of a lady who does honor to the Navy.” They\r\nshook hands solemnly.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Sally and Nancy found themselves on the open deck once\r\nmore, they were in prime condition for a long promenade.\r\n\r\n“My head is in a whirl!” Nancy exclaimed. “How could all this happen to\r\nus?”\r\n\r\n“We’re just what Danny would call fools for kick,” was Sally’s reply.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at the very mention of Danny, she felt an all but\r\nirrepressible desire to sink down on the deck. Danny too should have had\r\na part in all this. And where was he now?\r\n\r\n“The Captain was wonderful,” she said to Nancy. “He must know how we\r\nfeel about Danny.”\r\n\r\n“Of course he does. He knows we all worked together on the radio.”\r\n\r\n“And yet he never once mentioned Danny.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“No, and I think that is about the most wonderful of all.”\r\n\r\nFor a time after that they marched on in silence. In a shadowy corner\r\nthey passed two other WAVES seated on a pile of canvas. It was too dark\r\nto distinguish their faces.\r\n\r\nAfter passing beyond a ladder, they paused to watch the moon, a faint\r\nyellow ball, rolling through the fog that was thinning and blowing away.\r\n\r\nThen they heard one of the other WAVES talking. “Know who those girls\r\nare?” she was saying. “They are the ladies of the day. Imagine!” Her\r\nlaugh was not good to hear. “One of them worked in a radio shop. The\r\nother was a radio ham. Now they’re the ladies of the day. And I gave up\r\na five-thousand-a-year secretarial job to act as yeoman to Captain Mac\r\nQueen. Isn’t war just wonderful?”\r\n\r\n“Who is that girl?” Sally whispered, as she and Nancy hurried on.\r\n\r\n“She’s the Old Man’s yeoman all right (secretary to you),” Nancy\r\nreplied. “I recognized her voice.”\r\n\r\n“What’s she got against us?” Sally asked in a puzzled voice.\r\n\r\n“That’s for her to know and for us to find out,” said Nancy. “But she’ll\r\nbear watching!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n                            DANNY’S BUSY DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore falling asleep that night Sally found two faces appearing and\r\ndisappearing before her tired eyes. By drawing on her memory she had\r\nbeen able to recall the face of Erma Stone, the Skipper’s secretary.\r\nErma was tall and dark.\r\n\r\n“Rather foreign-looking,” she told herself. She dismissed the idea that\r\nshe might really be a foreigner and, perhaps, a spy. Foreigners could\r\nnot join the WAVES, and on such a mission as this all members would be\r\nchosen with great care.\r\n\r\n“She’s smart and has been successful,” she thought. “For some reason she\r\ndoes not like Nancy and me. It may be pure jealousy because of the\r\nfavors just shown us, or it may go much deeper than that. I’ll be on my\r\nguard.”\r\n\r\nThe second face that seemed to hang on the black wall of darkness was\r\nthe smiling countenance of Danny.\r\n\r\nIf she was troubled about Danny, as indeed she was, she might well\r\nenough have put her mind to rest for, at the moment at least, Danny was\r\ndoing very well indeed. He was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nNever given much to worrying, he had munched some iron rations, then, as\r\ndarkness fell, had spread his, heavy coat over him and, using the side\r\nof the craft as a pillow, had drifted off to peaceful slumber.\r\n\r\nHis awakening was rude and startling. Something hard and wet, like a\r\nwadded-up dishrag, had struck him squarely in the face.\r\n\r\nHe came up fighting and clawing. One hand caught the damp and slimy\r\nthing. The thing bit his fingers but he hung on.\r\n\r\nAfter dragging himself to a balanced position, he gave both hands to\r\nconquering the intruder.\r\n\r\n“Feathers,” he muttered. “A sea-bird. Food from the sea.” At that he\r\nfelt for the creature’s neck, got one more bite from the iron-like beak,\r\nthen put the wandering bird to rest with neatness and dispatch.\r\n\r\nHardly had he accomplished this, when, with all the force of a big\r\nleague baseball, a second object struck him squarely in the chest.\r\nCompletely bowled over, he barely avoided going overboard. This intruder\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nAfter searching about, he located a small flashlight. He started casting\r\nits gleams over the sea. All about him the black waters seemed alive.\r\n\r\n“Birds!” he exclaimed. “Thousands of them!”\r\n\r\nHe had not exaggerated. A great host of sea parrots, beating the water\r\nwith their tough little wings, were making their way south from their\r\nsummer home.\r\n\r\nThree more of them fell into his small boat and were added to his\r\nslender larder.\r\n\r\n“I must make the most of everything,” he told himself stoutly. “Men have\r\nlived for weeks on such a raft as this.”\r\n\r\nAt that, after watching the last ugly little traveler pass, he once more\r\ndrew his heavy coat over him and lay down to peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning Sally awoke with mingled feelings of joy, sorrow, and fear.\r\nShe was glad that the secret radio had proved to be so great a boon. Old\r\nC. K. could die happy. He had achieved a great success and this would\r\nnot go unrewarded.\r\n\r\nShe was sorry about Danny. She would miss him terribly. “It’s not a case\r\nof love,” she told herself almost fiercely, “We’re just good pals,\r\nthat’s all.” She did not believe in that word love. It could stand for\r\nso much and so little. A stuffy night on a dance floor—that, for some,\r\nwas love. Men loved their ladies so well they killed them so no one else\r\nwould get them. Bah! The word might as well be marked out of the\r\ndictionary. Perhaps the Old Man’s yeoman thought she was in love with\r\nDanny. Who could tell?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Danny Watched the Last Little Traveler Pass]\r\n\r\nIt was this same yeoman, Erma Stone, who sent a shudder running through\r\nher being.\r\n\r\n“I won’t think of it!” She sprang from her berth to turn on the secret\r\nradio. Turning the dials, first this one, then that, for some time, she\r\ncaught nothing.\r\n\r\n“Subs are far away this morning,” she reported to Riggs in the radio\r\nroom, as she passed on her way for coffee, bacon, and toast.\r\n\r\n“That’s fine, Sally!” he beamed. “Keep up the good work. As long as the\r\nweather remains fair that secret radio of yours will be your assignment,\r\nyours and Nancy’s. Don’t sit over it all the time, but tune in for a few\r\nminutes every hour. We can’t afford to take chances.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, Chief,” was her cheerful reply.\r\n\r\n“If the weather gets nasty, we may need your help,” he added.\r\n\r\n“It better stay fair.” Her brow wrinkled. “Danny’s out there somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“The storm gods don’t care for Danny,” he replied soberly. “Nor for any\r\nof the rest of us.”\r\n\r\n“Riggs,” she said, coming close and speaking low, “do you know any\r\nreason why the Captain’s yeoman should not like me?”\r\n\r\n“Erma Stone? No, why? Doesn’t she like you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid not.”\r\n\r\n“You never know about women.” Riggs looked away. “If one gets a grouch\r\non me I keep my eyes peeled, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Riggs. One thing more, do you think they will send a plane back\r\nto look for Danny?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve come too far since then. Besides, a plane rising from our ship\r\nmight catch the eye of some sub commander. That would be just too bad.\r\nThis is a mighty important convoy.”\r\n\r\nSally drank her coffee in a cloud of gray gloom. There was nothing she\r\ncould do for Danny, absolutely nothing. But when she came out on the\r\ndeck, the sun was shining brightly, gulls were sailing high and all\r\nseemed at peace. Since there was work to be done she snapped out of her\r\nblue mood and stepped into things in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThat night, since the weather was still beautiful and no dangers\r\nappeared to threaten, the Captain authorized a dance for the fliers, the\r\nsailors off duty, the nurses, and the WAVES.\r\n\r\nSome of the sailors had organized an orchestra of a sort, two fiddlers,\r\ntwo sax players, and a drummer.\r\n\r\nTo Sally this seemed to offer an hour of glorious relaxation. She loved\r\ndancing and did it very well, too. It seemed, however, that a whole\r\nflock of gremlins had joined the ship, just to disturb her peace of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was on hand to lead off the first dance, and chose her as\r\nhis partner.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to say: “Oh, Captain! Please! No!” But she dared not. So they\r\nled off the dance. It was a glorious waltz. The boys jazzed it a little.\r\nStill it was glorious.\r\n\r\nThe Old Man was a splendid dancer. She lost herself to the rhythm and\r\nswing of the music until, with a startling suddenness, her eyes met\r\nthose of Erma Stone.\r\n\r\nFrom the shock of that flashing look of hate she received such a jolt,\r\nthat, had not the Skipper held her steady, she must have fallen to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he asked. “Dizzy? I shouldn’t wonder. You’ve been\r\nworking rather hard and had a shock or two.” That was as close as he\r\nwould come to speaking of Danny.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing!” Summoning all her will power, she pulled herself back\r\ninto the swing. And so the dark siren was forgotten, but not for long.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut on the wide open sea Danny had had a busy day. Where he was the sun\r\ncame out bright and hot. After breakfast he began studying his\r\nwatermaking machine, and, in due time, had water that was a little\r\nbetter than city water and not as good as that from the old oaken bucket\r\non his uncle’s farm.\r\n\r\nAfter that he skinned and cleaned his birds. Then he sliced the meat\r\nthin and spread it out on the edge of the boat, where the sun shone hot,\r\nto dry.\r\n\r\n“That will do for dinner tonight,” he told himself. “If I only had a\r\ncookstove I’d get along fine.”\r\n\r\nHe would want something for supper. Perhaps a fish would do.\r\n\r\nAfter attaching a lure to his line he cast out into the deep. At the\r\nthird cast a gray shadow followed his lure halfway in. Then, rising to\r\nthe surface, it thrust out a fin like a plowshare.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” He hauled in his line. “Seems to me this isn’t Friday after all.”\r\nHe thought what would happen if that shark threw one flipper over the\r\nside of his raft.\r\n\r\n“It’s always something, but it ain’t never nothin’,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nSetting his coat up as a shade, he lay down to avoid the sun. And there\r\nwith the raft lifting and falling beneath him, he fell to musing on the\r\nwidth of the ocean, the number of ships passing that way, and the\r\nprobability of a storm.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this his eye caught a sudden gleam of light. A dark\r\ncloud was rolling along the horizon and from it came an ominous roar.\r\n\r\nApparently Danny need no longer wonder about the probability of a storm.\r\nThe flash of lightning which had attracted his attention, together with\r\nthe rolling thunder which accompanied it, made a squall, at any rate, a\r\ndistinct possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n                             THE DARK SIREN\r\n\r\n\r\n“Watch out for that dark-faced siren.”\r\n\r\nIt was Danny’s flying pal who spoke. The dance was still on and he, Fred\r\nAngel, was dancing with Sally.\r\n\r\n“You mean the Captain’s yeoman?” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“Sure I do. While you were dancing with him, she looked as if she’d like\r\nto murder you.”\r\n\r\n“Fred, why doesn’t she like me?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you guess?” He grinned.\r\n\r\n“I might try, but I’d probably be wrong.”\r\n\r\n“She thinks her boss is sweet on you.”\r\n\r\n“Fred! That’s ridiculous! He’s been good to me because I’ve been lucky\r\nenough to help out.”\r\n\r\n“Sure! That’s it,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“He’s interested in just one thing, the same as the rest of us, helping\r\nto bring this terrible war to an end.”\r\n\r\n“The thing that most of us are interested in,” Fred corrected her. “Some\r\npeople never get their minds off themselves for long. Miss Stone is like\r\nthat. You never worked in a large organization, did you, where there\r\nwere a lot of really big shots?”\r\n\r\n“No. I’m a small town girl.”\r\n\r\n“That’s where you were lucky. Me, I worked with a big city outfit and I\r\nsaw a lot of private secretaries like Erma Stone.”\r\n\r\n“Were they all like her?”\r\n\r\n“Most of them were, the very successful ones. They work like slaves, do\r\nthe boss’s work as well as their own. By and by they get to thinking\r\nthey own the boss. Erma is like that.”\r\n\r\n“And she thinks I’m trying to steal her property? That’s absurd!” Sally\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“That’s just part of it. Erma is a two-timer. She has got to like Danny\r\npretty well, too.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t blame her, do you?” Sally spoke with feeling.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. Danny’s one of the swellest guys I’ve ever known. He got a\r\nreal break last trip, sank a sub all by himself, and the rest of us\r\nnever even got a look-in,” Fred replied with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“So Erma set a trap to catch him, too?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“That’s what she did. And now, well, you know the answer from the books\r\nyou have read. Keep an eye on her, Sally. She’ll get to you sooner or\r\nlater. She may beat your time with the Old Man, but never with Danny,\r\nfor you’re in solid there—”\r\n\r\n“Danny,” she whispered, swallowing hard. “We may never see him again.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a chance there, but I’m betting on Danny!”\r\n\r\nThe dance was at an end.\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep my eyes open,” she whispered. “Fred,” her voice was low and\r\ntense—they were walking slowly toward her post of duty, “will we go\r\nback the way we came?”\r\n\r\n“No one knows that.”\r\n\r\n“But do you think we will?” she insisted.\r\n\r\nHe knew she was still thinking of Danny and wanted to help her, but\r\nlies, he knew, never help. “Well, yes,” he spoke slowly, “the Old Man\r\nwill return this way for he never forgets his boys. Grand old boy,\r\nCaptain MacQueen is.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Fred. That really helps a lot. And, Fred,” they were at the\r\ndoor of the radio cabin, “if you are sent out to search for Danny on the\r\nway back, will you take me along?”\r\n\r\n“Well, now that—” he pondered, “yes, I will, if I can, I’ll even let\r\nyou stow away.”\r\n\r\n“Stowaway. That’s a lovely word,” she laughed. “Shake. It’s a date.”\r\nWith a hearty handclasp, they parted.\r\n\r\nThat night Sally insisted on taking a two-hour shift with Riggs,\r\nblinking out her messages to the ships of the convoy.\r\n\r\n“I want to do something besides sitting and listening for trouble,” she\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nTruth was, a great loneliness had come sweeping over her. Perhaps the\r\ndance had done that. Certainly it had brought back memories of other\r\ntimes. Gay days at high school when she joined in the school hops which\r\nhad not been so grand but had for all that given her a feeling of\r\nbuoyant youth. There had been times too when, out with her father on a\r\nfishing trip, she had fallen in with a jolly crowd and had danced by the\r\nlight of a campfire.\r\n\r\nNow that the ship’s dance was over, and she stood looking at the endless\r\nblack waters rolling by, she felt very blue. But the instant the blinker\r\nwas in her hands and bright little messages came to her out of the\r\nnight, loneliness fled.\r\n\r\n“We’re a big family,” she said to Riggs.\r\n\r\n“A family of ships,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“And on those ships are enough people to populate a town as large as the\r\none where I was raised.”\r\n\r\n“Quite a young city,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“But it seems so sad that they should all be carried away from their\r\nhome towns.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sally Stood Looking at the Endless Black Waters]\r\n\r\n“Some of them got pretty tired of the old home town,” he mused. “But,\r\nboy! Won’t they be happy when they get a chance to go back!”\r\n\r\n“I hope it may be soon.”\r\n\r\nRiggs was a fine fellow. Sally liked him a lot.\r\n\r\n“Riggs,” she said, “if I get into trouble, really serious trouble, I’ll\r\ncome to you first thing.”\r\n\r\n“You do just that, Sally.” He put a hand on her shoulder. “You just\r\nspill it all to old Riggs. He’ll pull you out of it or die in the\r\nattempt.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Riggs. I feel so much better.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the dance that did that,” he slowly insisted. “Really there must\r\nbe some change in our lives or we break. The Old Man knows that. Great\r\nold fellow, the Captain.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSally and Nancy worked out a schedule all their own. Four hours on and\r\nfour off, day and night, turn and turn about, they stayed by the secret\r\nradio.\r\n\r\n“It seems such a simple thing to do!” Nancy exclaimed, after a full\r\ntwenty-four hours of it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” Sally agreed. “Nothing ever happens. I hear a little\r\n‘put-put-put-put-a-put’ now and then—”\r\n\r\n“Sure! So do I but it sounds far away. The subs seem close together so\r\nthey can’t be near—\r\n\r\n“So we just set the dials and sit and listen, and wait. But just think\r\nwhat has already happened and may happen again!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We stopped them. Stopped them dead. Ships and lives would have\r\nbeen lost.”\r\n\r\n“And so we must stick to our post for it may happen all over again.”\r\n\r\nIn the quiet days that followed there was an hour of dancing every\r\nnight. These were hours of real joy for Sally. The Captain, apparently\r\nconsidering that he had shown her all due courtesy, seldom asked for a\r\ndance. This left her free to enjoy Fred and his fellow fliers. Erma\r\nStone seemed to have forgotten her, but this, she told herself, was only\r\na lull before another storm.\r\n\r\nOne night while she stood by the rail, watching the black waters roll by\r\nand thinking gloomy thoughts, she suddenly found the Captain at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“I just wanted to tell you, Sally,” there was a mellow tone in his\r\nvoice, “that I haven’t forgotten Danny. I shall never forget him. He was\r\none of my finest. I am hoping our paths may cross yet.”\r\n\r\n“How—how can they?” she asked huskily.\r\n\r\n“We are taking this convoy to a certain port in England. There it will\r\nbe split up into smaller groups and convoyed by other fighting ships to\r\nother ports.”\r\n\r\n“That leaves us free?” There was a glad ring in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. We will follow the same course back. We have the spot where Danny\r\nwas lost marked on the chart and have a record of currents and winds\r\nthat may carry him off our course.”\r\n\r\n“Then you really think there is a chance?”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly, a real chance. We shall send out planes and scour the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\n“What a pity it could not have been done the hour he was lost.”\r\n\r\n“The battle was still on, then came the fog. After that we were far away\r\nand this great convoy hung on our shoulders like a crushing weight.” The\r\nSkipper sounded old and very tired. “It’s war, Sally. War! God grant\r\nthat it may soon be at an end.”\r\n\r\nAs she returned to her cabin after this talk she had with the Captain\r\nshe ran upon Danny’s mother. She had seen her several times of late, but\r\nthey had never spoken of Danny. Now she had something cheery to tell.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Mrs. Duke,” she invited. “I’ll make a cup of hot chocolate on\r\nmy electric plate, and we’ll have a talk.”\r\n\r\nWhen the cocoa had been poured steaming hot, she said: “I had a talk\r\nwith the Captain.”\r\n\r\n“Was it about Danny?” Mrs. Duke smiled knowingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, who else?” Sally smiled back.\r\n\r\n“Danny’s all right, that is, up to now.”\r\n\r\nSally did not ask how she knew. That would have been questioning a\r\nmother’s faith.\r\n\r\n“And he’s going to be all right,” Sally replied cheerfully. “The Captain\r\nsays we are to turn right back the moment we reach England, and that\r\nwe’ll have a look for Danny.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fine. Really, the Captain is a great and grand man.” Mrs. Duke\r\nwas warm in her praise.\r\n\r\nSally told all she knew. Danny’s mother beamed her gratitude. But as she\r\nrose to go, a wrinkle came to her brow. “It’s going to storm,” she said.\r\n“I feel it in my bones.”\r\n\r\nSally didn’t say: “That will be bad for Danny.” She said nothing at all,\r\njust watched the older woman as she walked out into the night.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose had been strange, hard days for Danny. He was not long in learning\r\nthat there is nothing so lonely as an empty sea. “If I get out of this\r\nalive,” he told himself, “I’ll always carry some book with thin pages\r\nand lots of reading, a Bible, a volume of Shakespeare, just anything.”\r\n\r\nHis threatened storm turned into a gentle shower. Spreading out his\r\ncoat, he caught a quart of water and poured it into a rubber bottle. The\r\nsupply of water that could be produced by his still, he knew, was\r\nlimited, and this might be a long journey.\r\n\r\nThat he was slowly going somewhere, he knew well enough. Winds and\r\ncurrents would see to that. Perhaps he would in time come to land. What\r\nland? Some wild, uninhabited island, a friendly shore, or beneath an\r\nenemy’s frowning fortifications? He shuddered at the thought.\r\n\r\nAt times he tried reciting poetry. One verse amused him:\r\n\r\n“‘This is the ship of pearl, which poets feign, sails the unshadowed\r\nmain.’ It’s a rubber ship,” he told himself, “but why quibble over small\r\ndetails?”\r\n\r\nAs he recalled the poem it ended something like this:\r\n\r\n         “‘Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\r\n           As the swift seasons roll!\r\n           Leave thy low-vaulted past!\r\n         Let each new’—(new what? Well, skip it!—)\r\n         ‘Shut thee from Heaven with a dome more vast,\r\n           Till thou at length art free,\r\n         Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea.’\r\n\r\n“That’s a fine idea,” he thought, “if I could make this rubber raft\r\ngrow. But I can’t, so I’d better catch me a fish.”\r\n\r\nThe sharks were gone. His fishing on that day met with marvelous\r\nsuccess. After a terrific struggle in which his boat was all but\r\ncapsized a dozen times, he succeeded in landing a twenty-pound king\r\nsalmon.\r\n\r\n“Boy, oh, boy!” he exclaimed. “How did you get way out here?”\r\n\r\nThat was not an important question. After cutting off the salmon’s head,\r\nhe sliced the rich, red steaks into strips and set them drying along the\r\nsides of his boat.\r\n\r\n“‘Take, eat, and be content,’” he quoted. “‘These fishes in your stead\r\nwere sent by him who sent the tangled ram, to spare the child of\r\nAbraham.’”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know what that was all about, but it did somehow seem to fit\r\nhis case, so he liked it.\r\n\r\nOne evening his sea was visited by one more flight of small birds with\r\nbig, ugly heads. By one device and another he captured six of these.\r\nFive went into his larder but the sixth being young-appearing and\r\ninnocent got a new lease on life. He tied it to the boat by a string. At\r\nfirst his pet objected strenuously, but in the end he settled down to a\r\ndiet of dried salmon meat and was content to sit by the hour perched on\r\nthe side of Danny’s boat. He looked like a parrot but, try as he might,\r\nDanny could not make him talk.\r\n\r\nAnd then this young “ancient mariner” was visited by both hope and\r\ndespair. A lone boat appeared on the horizon. It remained there for\r\nhours, at last came much closer, and then was swallowed up by a great\r\nbank of clouds rolling over the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\n                  LITTLE SHEPHERDESS OF THE BIG SHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same night, after dreaming of being in the old garden swing beneath\r\nthe apple tree at home, and of swinging higher and higher until the\r\nswing broke, letting her down on her head, Sally awoke to find herself\r\nstanding first on her feet and then on her head.\r\n\r\n“Something is terribly wrong,” she thought, still half asleep. “Where am\r\nI? What is happening?”\r\n\r\nJust then her head did bump the boards at the head of her berth and she\r\nknew. She was still aboard the aircraft carrier. A terrific storm had\r\nset the top-heavy craft to doing nose dives and near somersaults.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I should be seasick,” she told herself, “but I am not, not a\r\nbit. The Lord be praised for that.”\r\n\r\nJust then her ears caught a low moan.\r\n\r\n“Nancy!” she exclaimed, springing out of bed. “What’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“No-nothing. Every-every thing,” was the faltering answer. “Oh! Sally, I\r\ndo wish I could die on land.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” Sally exclaimed. “You won’t die. You’re seasick, that’s all.\r\nI’ve got some Lea and Perrins Sauce in my bag. It’s swell for\r\nseasickness, they say. Wait, I’ll get you some.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll wait.”\r\n\r\nAfter downing the red-hot pepper sauce, Nancy felt a little better, but\r\nhid her face in her pillow and refused to move.\r\n\r\nSally had left her three hours before listening in at the secret radio.\r\nNow she herself took a turn at listening. After a half hour of absolute\r\nradio silence she dragged the headset off her ears, rolled the radio in\r\nher blankets, drew on a raincoat, then slipped out into the storm.\r\n\r\nSlipped was exactly the right word. The instant she was outside the wind\r\ntook her off her feet. She went down with a slithering rush and slid\r\nfifteen feet to come up at last against a bulkhead.\r\n\r\n“It must be storming,” she said to a sailor who volunteered to help her\r\nto her feet.\r\n\r\n“I-I shouldn’t wonder,” he laughed, just as they went down in a heap.\r\n\r\n“Guess this is a good place to crawl,” he suggested, setting the\r\nexample. “The wind comes through here something fierce. Not-not so bad\r\nup there for-forward.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Sailor Helped Sally to Her Feet]\r\n\r\nFollowing his example, Sally crept on hands and knees to a more\r\nsheltered spot. Then, getting to their feet and gripping hands, they\r\nmade a dash for it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this wild race they were caught by one more mad rush of\r\nwind and piled up against the radio cabin door. Sally was on top.\r\n\r\n“This,” she said, “is where I get off. Thanks. Thanks a lot.”\r\n\r\nShe pushed the door open, allowed herself to be blown in, then closed\r\nthe door in the face of the gale.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it will storm?” she asked Riggs who was there alone.\r\n\r\n“It might at that,” he grumbled. He looked just terrible, Sally thought.\r\n\r\n“Good grief, Sally!” he exploded. “Aren’t you seasick?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” she laughed. “At least, not yet.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t be then. Thank God for that. How about taking over? I’m about\r\nthrough for now.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be glad to, Riggs.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve had to give up blinker signals. It’s so dark you couldn’t see a\r\nten-thousand watt searchlight. Besides, the ships go up and down so\r\nyou’d never get their messages. But we’ve got to keep in touch with\r\nevery blasted ship in the convoy. Get lost if we didn’t, bang into one\r\nanother, and sink everything.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know, Riggs.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve given up radio silence, had to. Anyway, no sub pack would attack\r\nin this howling hurricane. We use sound and radio, to keep the ships\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” she replied quietly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! You do? Then you tell me.” Even Riggs got a little peeved at times,\r\nwhen these lady sailors tried to tell him.\r\n\r\n“All right, here goes. Every two minutes you give the call number of\r\nsome ship in the convoy on the radio and then—”\r\n\r\n“Then you—” he began.\r\n\r\n“Who’s telling this?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Okay, Sally, okay!” Riggs laughed in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“You give a toot on the ship’s whistle,” Sally continued. “At the same\r\ntime you send out a radio impulse. The radio sound reaches the ship\r\ninstantly. The sound of the whistle is slower. The signal man on that\r\nother boat notes the difference between the time of arrival of radio\r\nimpulse and whistle. He does a little figuring, then he radios his\r\napproximate position in relation to your ship. After that you tell him\r\nto move so far this way and that. Then everything is hunky-dory until\r\nnext time.” Sally caught her breath.\r\n\r\n“Say, you know all the answers!” He laughed.\r\n\r\n“Not all, but some of them,” she corrected. “You don’t have to be dumb\r\nall the time, even if you are a girl.”\r\n\r\n“Guess that’s right. Well, now, go to it.” Riggs threw himself down on a\r\nlong seat that ran the length of the room, and Sally took up her work.\r\n\r\nFor a full hour the ship’s whistle spoke and the radio joined in. Sally\r\nwas there at the center of it all and enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\nThe tanker at the back of the convoy and to the right was slipping\r\nbehind. She advised them to shovel more coal. The English packet was\r\ncrowding its mate to the right. She shoved it out to sea. The big,\r\none-time ocean liner, now a transport, laden with boys in khaki, was\r\nstraying and might get itself lost. She called it in a few boat-lengths.\r\nThe three liberty ships were getting too chummy with one another. She\r\nspread them apart.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hour she glanced at the long seat. Riggs was gone. She\r\nwas alone with the ships and the storm. With a little gasp, she returned\r\nto her duties.\r\n\r\nWhen she made the rounds of the ships for the second time the other\r\nradiomen began to notice her.\r\n\r\n“Say! You’re all right!” the man on the big transport exclaimed over the\r\nradio. “You’re all right, but you sound like a lady. Are you?”\r\n\r\n“No chance,” was the snapping answer, “only a WAVE.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know about that?”\r\n\r\n“Hello, Sally!” came from a liberty ship. “How are you? I saw your\r\npicture in a movie!”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t!” she exploded.\r\n\r\n“Come on over and I’ll show it to you!” he jibed.\r\n\r\n“Can’t just now. I’m busy.” She cut him off.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours Danny’s mother appeared with sandwiches and hot\r\ncoffee. “Thought I’d find you here,” was her quiet comment. “So you’re\r\nthe little shepherdess of the big ships.” Sally joined her in the laugh\r\nthat followed. Never a word was said about Danny, nor would there be.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Nancy?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes. Don’t you worry about her. I fixed her up just fine.”\r\n\r\n“And Riggs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Riggs, too. He said to tell you he’d take over any time you sent\r\nfor him.”\r\n\r\n“I’m doing fine, I guess,” Sally smiled. “And I’m enjoying it no end.\r\n\r\n“But what about Lieutenant Tobin?” Sally asked. “The second radioman.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s sick too but he said he’d drag himself around soon.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Tobin lurched into the cabin a few moments later. Very\r\nunsteady on his feet but fighting to keep up his spirits, he said:\r\n\r\n“Nice storm, Sally. I never saw a better one. I’ll take over now.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Lieutenant. Just send for me any time. Storms don’t mean much\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“Lucky girl. Wish I was like that.”\r\n\r\nSally returned to her quarters, looked to Nancy’s comfort, then crept\r\nunder the blankets.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that she had only just fallen asleep, when a sailor\r\npounded on her door.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Tobin’s busted two ribs,” he announced. “He got slammed\r\nagainst a stanchion. Lieutenant Riggs requests that you take over.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be there in no time.” Again she hurried into her clothes.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Sally.” Riggs seemed shaken by the very violence of the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. I love it.” She managed a smile.\r\n\r\n“Got to see that Tobin has proper care. Tried to get to the rail,\r\nwell—you know why. A big wave slammed him hard. It’s terrible, this\r\nstorm is. I’ll relieve you later.” Riggs went away. Sally settled back\r\nin her place.\r\n\r\nNever before had Sally experienced such a sense of power. She held many\r\ngreat ships and thousands of lives in the hollow of her hand. “Some of\r\nthem know I’m a girl. Some even know who I am, and yet they trust me.”\r\nThe thought made her feel warm inside.\r\n\r\n“It’s worth the whole cost, just this,” she told herself. The whole\r\ncost? Yes, giving up her work with old C. K., bidding good-by to her\r\nfamily and friends. It was worth all that and more.\r\n\r\nBut Danny! If she had lost him forever? She dared not think of Danny.\r\nThe very thought would unnerve her. Her work would suffer. She might\r\nmake some terrible blunder.\r\n\r\n“One increasing purpose,” a very good man had said to her. “That’s what\r\nwe need in these terrible hours.”\r\n\r\nOne increasing purpose. That was what she must have in this hour of\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nRiggs returned. Sitting down dizzily, he watched and listened for a\r\ntime. Then, leaning back, he seemed to go into a sort of coma.\r\n\r\nAt the end of four hours, he came out of this, pushed her aside,\r\nmumbled, “Go get some rest,” then took over.\r\n\r\nAfter fighting her way down the deck, she tumbled into her stateroom,\r\nbanged the door shut, shoved the secret radio into a corner, rolled the\r\nblankets about her and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThree hours later she was once more at her post.\r\n\r\n“I-I’ll be here if you need me.” Riggs threw himself on the hard seat\r\nand was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the Skipper looked in upon her.\r\n\r\n“How are they coming?” he asked, closing the door without a bang.\r\n\r\n“All right, I guess.” Sally nodded to a sort of peg-board map that\r\nindicated the location of each ship in the convoy at any particular\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nHe studied the map for a time in silence. “That’s fine,” was his\r\ncomment. “Really first class.”\r\n\r\n“How’s your yeoman?” she asked. There was a twinkle in her eye.\r\n\r\nHis eyes returned the twinkle. “She hasn’t bothered me for quite a time.\r\nShe’s under the weather, I suspect.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Riggs with a questioning eye.\r\n\r\n“He’s all right,” she hastened to assure him. “Doing all he can.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a terrible storm, worst I’ve ever seen in these waters. I’m having\r\nropes strung along the ship. You’d better stick to them pretty closely.\r\nWe can’t afford to lose you.” Then he was gone.\r\n\r\nHis visit had made her happy. It is something when a really big man\r\nsays, “We can’t afford to lose you.” Well, they wouldn’t lose her nor\r\neven have occasion to miss her for long at a time.\r\n\r\nThe storm roared on. Boats pitched and tossed. The English packet had\r\nits rigging blown away. The tanker reported a damaged rudder and a\r\ndestroyer went to her aid.\r\n\r\nDay dawned at last and they began using flags for signals. With very\r\nlittle rest, buried in heavy sweaters and slicker, Sally stood like a\r\nship’s figure-head on the tower and signaled all day long.\r\n\r\nOnce Nancy came to take her place. She lasted for an hour.\r\n\r\n“It-it’s not that I can’t take-it.” Nancy was ready to cry when Sally\r\nrelieved her. “It’s this terrible seasickness.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. Just forget it. The storm will be over before you know\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t over when Sally went for a few hours of rest, but the clouds\r\nwere gone, the moon was out, and because of possible submarine menace,\r\nthey had gone back to blinker signals.\r\n\r\nAt ten she was at her new post blinking signals. Time and again, as the\r\nhours passed, waves sent their spray dashing over her. When at last she\r\nwas relieved, she was half frozen and soaked to the skin.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, when she reached her cabin, she found the door\r\nswinging.\r\n\r\n“What now?” she whispered. Nancy, she knew, had been removed to the sick\r\nbay where Mrs. Duke could look after her.\r\n\r\nAs she bounced into the room, slamming the door after her, she surprised\r\na tall figure bending over her secret radio.\r\n\r\nThe instant she saw the girl’s face, she gasped. It was Erma Stone, the\r\nCaptain’s yeoman. Her face was a sight to behold. She had been sick, all\r\nright.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she’s delirious,” Sally thought.\r\n\r\nThe instant she caught the look of hate and cunning in the girl’s eyes,\r\nshe knew this guess was wrong.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“I was sent here to make sure you had not been sending messages on this\r\nradio.” Miss Stone stood her ground.\r\n\r\n“How would you know whether I had or not?” Sally demanded.\r\n\r\n“I would—”\r\n\r\n“You were not sent here!” Sally was rapidly getting in beyond her\r\ndepths. “You came of your own accord. Why? I don’t know. But I’ll know\r\nwhy you left!” She took a step forward.\r\n\r\nDodging past her, the girl threw the door open and was gone.\r\n\r\n“She was going to send a message,” Sally told herself. “Then I’d get the\r\nblame. She couldn’t do that. There is no one to listen at this hour of\r\nthe night. She—”\r\n\r\nSally’s thoughts broke off short. Yes, someone might be listening. The\r\nenemy subs; and if they heard, all her secrets would be out.\r\n\r\nHad the girl succeeded in sending a message? She doubted that, for this\r\nwas a secret radio in more ways than one.\r\n\r\nA brief study of the radio assured her that no messages could have been\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nAfter making sure of this, she snapped on her headset to sit listening\r\nfor a half hour. She caught again that “put-put-put.” It seemed nearer\r\nnow. Tomorrow she and Nancy should get back to this secret radio.\r\n\r\nAt that she dragged off her sodden garments, rubbed herself dry, drew on\r\na heavy suit of pajamas, then rolled up in her blankets. Soon she was\r\nfast asleep. And the storm roared on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n                      THE SECRET RADIO WINS AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sally awoke, hours later, the sun was shining. Great billowing\r\nwaves with no foam on their crests were rolling their ship up and down.\r\nThe worst of the storm was over.\r\n\r\nLooking like a ghost, Riggs crawled out of his hole to resume his\r\nduties. Even Nancy was back to her old, normal self.\r\n\r\n“You take it nice and easy, Sally,” was Riggs’s advice. “You’ve done a\r\nswell job and deserve a rest.”\r\n\r\nAfter drinking her coffee and eating toast and oatmeal at a real mess\r\ntable, Sally felt swell. She took a turn or two along the deck, then\r\nclimbed the ladder to the flight deck. There she came across Fred.\r\n\r\n“Quite some storm,” he grinned. “We had a heck of a time keeping the\r\nplanes from taking off all by themselves. But say!” His face sobered.\r\n“What about Danny? What do you know about him out there on a rubber\r\nraft?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know a thing, and I try not to think about it,” was her solemn\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, some ship may have picked him up. And then, again, this storm\r\nmight not even have gone his way.” Fred was a cheerful soul.\r\n\r\nSally went back to the lower deck. In her own stateroom, she hooked up\r\nthe secret radio, then lay propped up in her berth listening.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once she caught a low “put-put-put.” “Still far away,” she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nFor three hours she lay there turning dials, listening, then turning\r\nmore dials. Now and then she dozed off into a cat nap. But not for long.\r\nShe was disturbed. Each passing hour found the “put-puts” coming in\r\nstronger. There was one particular broadcaster whose code messages\r\nfairly rang in her ears.\r\n\r\nBy working on her record of messages and her German dictionary, she was\r\nable to tell that this particular broadcaster was directing the course\r\nof several other subs.\r\n\r\n“They must be subs,” she told herself. “And such a lot of them! Twelve\r\nor fourteen. And they are coming this way.”\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? Had one or two of the enemy subs from that other pack\r\nescaped? Had they joined another larger wolf-pack and were they all\r\ncoming in to attack?\r\n\r\nShe took all these questions to the Captain’s cabin. She found the\r\n“siren” at her typewriter, but ignored her. When she had made her report\r\nto the Captain, he said:\r\n\r\n“Our radio was going yesterday. That was unavoidable. We may be\r\nattacked. How soon do you think it may come?”\r\n\r\n“They seem quite a distance away. It may be several hours yet,” Sally\r\nreplied thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Several hours? I hope so. By that time we shall be in waters that are\r\nwithin striking distance of powerful land-based planes in England. When\r\nwe’re sure the attack is to be made we’ll radio for aid. Those big\r\nplanes will blast the subs from the sea!”\r\n\r\n“But do you think they will come right in as they did before—the subs,\r\nI mean?” Sally asked.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he asked, seeming a little surprised.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they have been warned. They may try some new trick,” Sally\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n“It’s hard to imagine what that might be. Certainly they can’t sink our\r\nships without coming in where we are. Keep a sharp watch. Stick to that\r\nradio of yours and report to Riggs every hour.”\r\n\r\nSally returned to her cabin with grave misgiving. That the enemy would\r\nrepeat the performance of that other day seemed improbable. There was,\r\nof course, a fair chance that they did not know of the catastrophe that\r\nhad befallen that other sub pack.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that we have had enough for one trip,” Nancy said when\r\nSally told her what was happening.\r\n\r\n“In war no one ever has enough trouble,” was Sally’s sober reply. “There\r\nis no such word as enough in the war god’s dictionary. It is always more\r\nand more and more. I’ve heard that we’re losing two hundred ships a\r\nmonth. No one seems to know for sure. One thing is certain, _we_ haven’t\r\nlost any and we’re about two days from England.”\r\n\r\nIt did seem, after an hour had passed, and then another, that this sub\r\npack was going to do just as the other had done. As Sally listened,\r\nturned dials, and waited, the broadcasters on the enemy subs began to\r\nfan out. After that, with a slow movement that was ominous, they began\r\nto surround the convoy. After the circle had been completed they started\r\nmoving in.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour before sunset when she hurried to the radio room.\r\n\r\n“Rig-Riggs!” She was stammering in her excitement. “They are all around\r\nus!”\r\n\r\n“How close?” He blinked tired eyes.\r\n\r\n“There’s no way to know that,” she replied cautiously.\r\n\r\n“They’ll attack at dusk. Always do. You can’t see the wake of their\r\nperiscopes so well then.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think we should send for the big planes from the mainland?”\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n“It may be too soon. We want them to arrive at what you might call the\r\npsychological moment. Wait. I’ll ask the Skipper.”\r\n\r\nHe called the Captain on the ship’s phone, then stated his problem.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think so?” he spoke into the phone. “I thought that might be\r\nbest, sir.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, all the men are at battle stations now. I’ll wait, sir.” He\r\nhung up.\r\n\r\n“The Skipper says to wait,” he explained “He—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off short for at that moment the lookout sang out:\r\n\r\n“A sub off the port side.”\r\n\r\n“Sub—sub off the port side,” came echoing back.\r\n\r\nAt once there came the sound of running feet, of guns swung to position,\r\nand more shouts: “Subs! Subs!”\r\n\r\nSally dashed to the rail. Just what she meant to do, she did not know.\r\nAt any rate, it was never done for, at that instant, a gun roared and in\r\nthree split seconds a shell crashed into the radio cabin.\r\n\r\n“Torpedo!” a voice shouted.\r\n\r\n“Hard to port! Hard to port!” the man on the bridge roared.\r\n\r\nWith a sense of doom Sally saw the radio cabin smashed, then saw a\r\ntorpedo leave the sub. Fascinated, terrified, she watched it come. It\r\nseemed alive. It played like a porpoise. First it was in the air above\r\nthe water, then beneath the water.\r\n\r\nWith sudden terror, she realized that the torpedo would strike the ship\r\ndirectly beneath her. The order to turn the ship had come too late.\r\n\r\n“And when it does strike!” Her knees trembled. For the first time in her\r\nlife, she was paralyzed with fear.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo came on rapidly. Now it was fifty feet away, forty, thirty.\r\nIt dove beneath the water, rose sharply, sped through the air, and—\r\n\r\nShaking herself into action, Sally turned and ran. Headed for the\r\nopposite side of the ship she was all prepared for a terrific roar\r\naccompanied by the sound of rending and crashing of timbers. But none\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nRacing headlong, she banged into the gunwale on the opposite side, to\r\nstand there panting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she rubbed her eyes, then looked at the sea. “It’s gone,” she\r\nmurmured. “The torpedo is going away. It must have plunged low and gone\r\nunder the ship.”\r\n\r\nHer instant of relief was cut short by the realization that there were\r\nother torpedoes and shells, that the battle had just begun and that a\r\nshell had gone through their radio cabin.\r\n\r\n“Riggs!” she cried. “Riggs was in that cabin!”\r\n\r\nShe reached the radio door just as two sailors carried Riggs out. His\r\nface was terribly white.\r\n\r\nAsking no questions, she brushed past them and into the cabin. With\r\nTobin and Riggs gone, she must carry on.\r\n\r\nA look at the radio gave her a sense of relief. It had not been damaged.\r\nShe tested it and her heart sank.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” she murmured. Then: “It’s the power wires. They’ve been cut.”\r\n\r\nOne moment for inspection and she was gripping a hatchet, cutting away a\r\nvarnished panel that hid the wires.\r\n\r\nFinding rubber gloves, tape, pliers, and a coil of wire, she set about\r\nthe business of repairing the wires.\r\n\r\n“Every second counts,” she told herself. “Those bombers from the\r\nmainland must be called.”\r\n\r\nThe wires had been connected; she was just testing out the radio when\r\nthe Skipper bounded into the cabin.\r\n\r\n“The radio!” he exclaimed. “Can it be repaired?”\r\n\r\n“It has been repaired. It’s working!” she replied, straightening up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sally Saw Two Sailors Carry Riggs Out]\r\n\r\n“Working. Thank God! Call this—one—seven—three—seven. Repeat it in\r\ncode, three times.”\r\n\r\nShe put in the call. Then they waited. Suddenly, the radio began to\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\n“That’s their answer,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Tell them to send bombers. We’re being attacked by subs, this\r\nposition.” He laid a paper before her.\r\n\r\nShe set the accelerator talking.\r\n\r\nAgain they waited.\r\n\r\nAgain came the snap-snap of code.\r\n\r\n“Repeat,” she wired back.\r\n\r\nThe message was repeated. “Okay,” she wired. “They’re sending twenty\r\nbombers,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Good! What about Riggs?” the Captain asked.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t here. They carried him out,” said Sally.\r\n\r\n“And Tobin?”\r\n\r\n“He has two broken ribs,” was the quiet reply.\r\n\r\n“I’ll send you a young second lieutenant. He knows radio.”\r\n\r\n“We—we’ll make out.” Sally hated herself for stammering.\r\n\r\n“Good!” He was gone.\r\n\r\nHad the enemy gun crew had their way, Sally would by this time have been\r\namong the missing. But, thanks to the timely warning, all the men of the\r\naircraft carrier had been at their posts when the sub appeared on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe instant the sub poked its snout out of the water the long noses of\r\nfive-inch guns were being trained on it. The first enemy shot had\r\ncrashed into the radio cabin, but every other shot went wild. One went\r\nsinging over Sally’s head and another cut a stanchion not ten feet from\r\nwhere she stood, but she had worked on.\r\n\r\nMore and more guns were trained on the sub. A colored crew chanted:\r\n“’Mm, I got shoes, you got shoes, all God’s chillun got shoes.”\r\n\r\n“Bang! Pass up another shell, brother. That un wrecked the conning\r\ntower. ’Ummm, I got shoes, you got shoes—”\r\n\r\nBang! One split second passed and there came a terrific explosion. The\r\nsub had blown up.\r\n\r\nBy this time the enemy’s plan was plain to see. This sub had been sent\r\nin to wreck the ship’s radio at once, then to sink her at their leisure.\r\nIt would be impossible this way for the carrier to summon aid from land\r\nplanes. It was true that this task might have been taken over by a cargo\r\nship or a destroyer but before these ships could know of the need, it\r\nwould be too late.\r\n\r\nWith the threat to his ship removed, the Captain ordered his planes off\r\non a search for the remainder of the wolf-pack.\r\n\r\nWith a strange feeling at the pit of her stomach, Sally heard them take\r\noff one after the other.\r\n\r\n“Fred and all his comrades,” she whispered. “What will the score be\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\nA youthful face appeared at the door. “I’m Second Lieutenant Burns,”\r\nsaid the boy. “I was sent to pinch-hit on the radio.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fine!” Sally gave him her best smile. “You just look things\r\nover. If you want to give me a few moments off, it will be a blessing\r\nstraight from Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Things happen pretty fast.” He smiled back at her.\r\n\r\n“Too fast.” She was rocking a little on her feet.\r\n\r\n“You were lucky at that.” He grinned. “I watched those shots. If it\r\nhadn’t been for that singing gun crew, one of those shells would have\r\nblown this cabin sky high.”\r\n\r\n“But it didn’t.” Sally felt a little sick. “I’ll just get back to my\r\nsecret radio for a moment,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Okay, I’ll take over.” He settled down in his place.\r\n\r\nThe messages she picked up on her radio were a jumble of sounds. Every\r\nbroadcaster of the enemy subs was trying to talk to every other.\r\n\r\n“We got their leader!” she thought as her heart gave a triumphant leap.\r\n“Now they’re all looking for orders and getting none.”\r\n\r\nHer hope for a quick and easy victory over this new and more powerful\r\nsub pack was soon dashed to the ground. In a very short time there came\r\ninto the enemy broadcasts a firmer and more confident note.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Sally exclaimed. “Some other sub commander has taken charge of the\r\npack! Now there will be a real fight.”\r\n\r\nSoon enough the fliers who went out to the attack found this to be true.\r\nWarned, no doubt, by the experience of that other sub pack, these subs\r\ncame in with only their periscopes showing. Fred, who carried a radioman\r\nwho was also a gunner in his two-seated plane, searched the sea in vain\r\nfor a full fifteen minutes. Then suddenly he caught over his radio a\r\ncall for help from one of the tankers.\r\n\r\n“We’re about to be attacked,” was the terse message.\r\n\r\nOnly twenty seconds from that very tanker, Fred swung sharply about,\r\nbarked an order to his gunner, then moved in.\r\n\r\n“There’s the sub!” the gunner shouted. “Over to the left.”\r\n\r\nSighting his target, Fred swung wide and low. Aiming at the white wake\r\nof the sub’s periscope he let go a depth bomb. It was a near hit and\r\nbrought the sub to the surface but it seemed to the young flier that she\r\ncame up shooting; at least, by the time they had swung back, the sub’s\r\ngun was barking.\r\n\r\n“Hang onto your shirt,” Fred called to his gunner. “Get ready to mow ’em\r\ndown, we’re dropping in on them.” At that he shot straight down two\r\nthousand feet, leveled off with a wide swoop, then sent a murderous hail\r\nof machine-gun bullets sweeping across the sub’s crowded deck. As they\r\npassed on, his gunner sent one more wild burst tearing at them.\r\n\r\nOn the sub men went down in rows. The sea was dotted by their struggling\r\nforms. Those who remained crowded down the conning tower. Then the sub\r\ncrash-dived. For the time, at least, the tanker and its priceless cargo\r\nwere saved.\r\n\r\nBut now there came a call from the big transport which carried a\r\nthousand men in khaki on its crowded decks. She too was about to be\r\nattacked. Sally, standing on the tower, watching, ready to blink\r\nsignals, caught the message but could do nothing. The small English\r\npacket, the _Orissa_, also caught the message. Small as she was, and\r\narmed with but one gun, she moved swiftly in, cutting off the sub’s line\r\nof attack on the big transport.\r\n\r\nAs if angered, by this interference, the sub commander brought his sub\r\nto the surface, prepared to finish off the small ship with gunfire. But\r\ntwo can play with firearms. The packet carried a gun crew that had done\r\nservice on many seas. The foam was hardly off the sub when a shell from\r\nthe _Orissa_ blasted off one side of the sub’s conning tower. The shot\r\nwas returned but without great harm. One more shot from the _Orissa’s_\r\nplucky gunners and the sub’s gun was out of commission. Perhaps, after\r\nthis beating, the sub’s commander planned to submerge and leave the\r\nscene of action. Whatever his plans might have been, they were never\r\ncarried out, for a fighter from the aircraft carrier that had come to\r\nthe rescue swung low to place a bomb squarely on the sub’s deck. The\r\n_Orissa_ was showered with bits of broken steel as the sub blew up with\r\na great roar.\r\n\r\nThis was a good start but there were many subs, some of them very large.\r\nWithout doubt they had received orders to get that convoy at any cost,\r\nfor they kept coming in.\r\n\r\nFred and his partner, still scouring the sea, discovered a sub slipping\r\nup on one of the liberty ships. Swinging low they scored a near hit with\r\na bomb. The sub’s periscope vanished. Was it a hit? They could not tell.\r\nOne more miss and they were soaring back to their own deck for a fresh\r\ncargo of death.\r\n\r\nSeeing them coming in, Sally handed her blinker to Nancy and raced down\r\nto find out how things were going.\r\n\r\n“It’s bad enough,” was Fred’s instant response. “We’ve lost one plane to\r\nAA fire but the pilot bailed out and was picked up by a destroyer. A sub\r\nscored a hit on one of the liberty ships but it is all shored up and\r\nholding its own. If only those big bombers from England would come!” His\r\nbrow wrinkled.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be seein’ you.” He climbed into his plane and was once more\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\n“If only those big bombers would come!” Sally echoed his words as she\r\nreturned to the tower.\r\n\r\nNow, once again, a large sub, apparently assigned to the task, slipped\r\nin close to the aircraft carrier, and life on board became tense indeed.\r\nTwo additional airplanes were thrown into the battle. One of these\r\nbrought the sub to the surface with a depth charge. Sally drew in a deep\r\nbreath as she saw the sub’s size. “Big as a regular ship,” she murmured\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n“And twice as dangerous,” said the young lieutenant who stood at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this was not long in proving itself, for suddenly a shell\r\nwent screaming past them and a second tore bits of the tower away.\r\n\r\nBut the sub was not having things all her own way. A daring young flier\r\nswooped low to pour a deadly fire across her bow. For a moment her guns\r\nwere silenced, but no longer. This time she directed her fire skyward\r\nand with deadly effect. A fighter, some three thousand feet in the air,\r\nwas hit and all but cut in two.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Sally exclaimed. “They got that plane.” She knew the plane and the\r\nboys who flew her. Now her eyes were glued on the sky. Her lips parted\r\nwith a sigh of relief as a parachute blossomed in the sky. But where was\r\nthe other one? It never blossomed. The plane came hurtling down to\r\nvanish instantly.\r\n\r\n“If only those big bombers would come!” Sally’s cry was one of anguish.\r\nShe could not stand seeing those fine boys go down to death.\r\n\r\nAnother shell sped across their deck. At the same time there came again\r\nthe cry, “Torpedo off the port bow.”\r\n\r\nOnce more, with terror in her eyes, Sally watched a torpedo speed toward\r\nthe broad side of their ship. This time it seemed it could not miss. But\r\nagain came that strange hum, as the gun crew began to sing, “I got\r\nshoes, you got shoes.”\r\n\r\nThere was a splash close to the speeding torpedo, and another and yet\r\nanother. It seemed impossible that any gun could fire so fast. And then\r\nan explosion rocked the ship. What had happened? Sally had looked away\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\n“That’s some gun crew,” the lieutenant exclaimed. “They just blew that\r\ntorpedo out of the water.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful!” Sally exclaimed. “All the same, this can’t last. There are\r\ntoo many of those subs. I do wish the big bombers would come.”\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to her prayer, there came a great rumbling in the clouds\r\nthat hung high over them in the evening sky and suddenly, as if it had\r\nseen all and had been sent to deliver them from the giant sub, a\r\nfour-motored bomber came sweeping down. As Sally watched, breathless,\r\nshe saw a dozen white spots emerge from the big bomber and come shooting\r\ndown. It was strange. At first they seemed a child’s toy. Then they were\r\nlike large arrows with no shafts, just heads and feathered ends. And\r\nthen they were a line of bombs speeding toward their target. She\r\nwatched, eyes wide, lips parted, as they hit the sea. The first one fell\r\nshort, and the second, and third and then once more there was a roar.\r\n\r\n“A direct hit!” the young lieutenant shouted. “That does it.”\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke and spray had drifted away, Sally saw the giant sub\r\nstanding on one end. Then, as the last rays of the setting sun gilded it\r\nwith a sort of false glory, the sub slowly sank from sight.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Sally breathed. “How grand!” For all that there was a sinking\r\nfeeling at the pit of her stomach. The men on that sub too were human,\r\nand some were very young.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Watched Breathlessly as the Bomb Struck]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky was full of giant bombers and the air noisy with the\r\nshouts of thousands of voices welcoming the deliverers.\r\n\r\n“Here,” Sally handed the blinker to Nancy, “take this. I’ve just thought\r\nof something that needs doing.” At that she sped away.\r\n\r\nA moment later Sally was in her stateroom listening to the secret radio.\r\nThe question uppermost in her mind at that moment was: How will the\r\nenemy subs take this new turn in the battle? She had the answer very\r\nsoon; they were not taking it. At first there came a series of hurried\r\nand more or less jumbled messages from very close in. After that the\r\nenemy radio messages settled down and were spaced farther apart. Each\r\nnew burst of “put-puts” came in more faintly, which meant that the subs\r\nwere withdrawing.\r\n\r\nWhen at last she was sure that, for the time, the fight was over, she\r\nhurried to the Captain’s cabin.\r\n\r\n“The subs have withdrawn,” she announced.\r\n\r\n“Good!” the Captain exclaimed. “How far? Are they still withdrawing?”\r\n\r\n“That’s hard to tell,” Sally replied cautiously.\r\n\r\n“They’ll withdraw for now,” he prophesied, “and come back to the attack\r\nat dawn. Their theory will be that the big bombers will have to return\r\nto their land bases.”\r\n\r\n“Which they must.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. But there is no reason why they should not return at dawn\r\nif there is still work for them to do. Our enemy does not yet realize\r\nthat, thanks to your secret radio, we can keep track of their movements.\r\nPerhaps we can catch them off guard at dawn and finish them. That,” the\r\nCaptain added, “will depend on you and your secret radio.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a terrible responsibility,” was the girl’s quiet reply, “but I\r\naccept it. I shall be listening, all through the night.”\r\n\r\nThat night will live long in Sally’s memory. She slept not at all. At\r\nall hours the headset was over her ears. At first there were few\r\nmessages passing from sub to sub.\r\n\r\n“They are sleeping,” she told herself. Then the lines of a very old poem\r\nran through her mind:\r\n\r\n At midnight in his guarded tent the Turk lay dreaming of the hour\r\n When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent, should tremble at his power.\r\n\r\n“There will be no trembling,” she told herself stoutly. She knew that\r\nall had been arranged. If she reported that the subs were again moving\r\nin to the attack, the big land bombers would be notified and would\r\nreturn to surprise the wary foe. But would the subs attack? Only time\r\ncould tell.\r\n\r\nAt the eerie hour of three in the morning, she began picking up\r\nmessages, sent from sub to sub, some near, some far away.\r\n\r\n“I think reinforcements are coming in,” she phoned the Skipper, who was\r\nat the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Good! Then we will have more to destroy,” was his reply.\r\n\r\nThe hour before dawn came at last and with it the enemy subs, at least\r\nten in number, slowly closing in. With a radio message sent to the\r\nmainland, they could but wait the dawn.\r\n\r\nThis time, confident of success and eager for the kill, the subs\r\nsurfaced and came racing in. They were met by bombs from every plane the\r\naircraft carrier could muster and from thirty land bombers as well.\r\nTheir rout was complete, and the destruction, insofar as could be\r\nlearned, was to them a great disaster.\r\n\r\nLeaving the land-based bombers to finish the job, the convoy steamed on\r\ntoward its destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\n                             OH, DANNY BOY!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hours that followed every nerve was tense. They had won another\r\nbattle but not without loss. The terrors of war at sea had come to stand\r\nout before every WAVE on board in sharper reality than ever before.\r\n\r\nIt was so with Sally and Nancy. They had volunteered for sea duty and,\r\nas long as their services in this capacity were required, there would be\r\nno turning back. The spirit of youth that had flowed in their veins as\r\nthey boarded the ship only a few days before was being exchanged for\r\nsterner stuff.\r\n\r\nUppermost in the minds of all was the question of enemy subs. Twice they\r\nhad been defeated, but the convoy they had hoped to destroy was\r\npriceless. Would they strike again?\r\n\r\nThroughout one long, sleepless night both Sally and Nancy hovered over\r\ntheir secret radio. The “put-put-put” of strange enemy broadcasts was\r\ncoming in constantly. There were still plenty of subs about. At first\r\nthey appeared to be scattered far apart. But in time they seemed to be\r\nassembling for attack.\r\n\r\nEvery hour Sally reported to the Captain. In spite of the fact that it\r\nwas impossible to tell the exact position of this sub pack, at three in\r\nthe morning huge four-motored bombers, hovering overhead, were radioed a\r\nmessage and they went zooming away in the bright moonlight.\r\n\r\nAn hour later a message came in that they had surprised two large subs\r\non the surface, probably engaged in charging batteries, and had sunk\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn Sally, tired but happy, reported to the Captain:\r\n\r\n“The loss of those two subs seems to have broken the pack up.”\r\n\r\n“What’s happening now?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“They’re spreading out. Their messages are fading.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they have given it up and are heading for their home ports. If\r\nso, that’s good news. In less than twenty-four hours we shall be safe in\r\nport.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Happy day!” Sally exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd it was indeed a happy day when, with her convoy, every precious ship\r\nof it safe, the aircraft carrier dropped anchor in a broad harbor. A\r\nsmall puffing tug came alongside to take members of the crew, who had\r\nbeen granted shore leave, to the dock. Among these were Sally, Nancy,\r\nErma Stone, Riggs, and Mrs. Duke.\r\n\r\nSally, Nancy, and Danny’s mother stuck close together once they entered\r\nthe streets of the only European city they had ever known.\r\n\r\n“So this is merry England,” said Nancy. “It doesn’t seem very merry.”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it did not. A heavy fog hung over the city. The streets were\r\nnarrow and dark. The people were poorly dressed. They seemed overworked\r\nand weary.\r\n\r\n“They are merry in a way, all the same,” said Sally. “Take a look at\r\ntheir faces.”\r\n\r\nNancy did just that and was amazed. In every face was the glorious light\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\n“How can you be happy after so many months of war?” Sally asked of a\r\nvery old lady.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the Americans are coming,” the cracked old voice replied. “You are\r\nan American, aren’t you?” she asked, peering at Sally’s blue uniform.\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course. I’m a WAVE.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! A lady soldier?”\r\n\r\n“No, a lady sailor,” Sally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Then you were in the convoy that just came in.” The woman’s voice\r\ndropped to a whisper. “How many of your ships did they get?”\r\n\r\nSally hesitated. She looked the woman over. She was English from head to\r\ntoe. She was old and tired, hungry, too, yet she dared be cheerful. She\r\nwanted good news. Well, then, she should have it.\r\n\r\n“Not a ship,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, then you brought us good luck,” the old woman cackled joyously.\r\n“You must come again and again.”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall,” said Sally. “It’s been truly wonderful.\r\n\r\n“And terrible,” she whispered to herself when the old woman had moved\r\non.\r\n\r\nSally put a hand in her coat pocket, then laughed low. In that pocket\r\nwas a present for someone.\r\n\r\nA little farther on they overtook a small girl. She was thinly clad. Her\r\nthin face appeared pinched by the fog and cold.\r\n\r\n“See, I have a present for you,” said Sally, taking her hand out of the\r\npocket. In the hand were two hard-boiled eggs. She had saved them from\r\nher breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes shone, but she did not take the eggs. Instead she\r\ngrasped Sally by the hand. After leading her down a narrow alley, she\r\nopened a door in the brick wall, then stood politely aside while Sally,\r\nNancy, and Mrs. Duke walked in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “See, I Have a Present for You” Said Sally]\r\n\r\nThe room they entered was a small kitchen. It was scrupulously clean.\r\nBeside a small fire on an open hearth stood the girl’s mother.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you have brought us company, Mary!” she exclaimed. “These fine\r\nladies from the boats. Won’t you be seated?” she invited.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we won’t stay,” Sally smiled. “I offered Mary two eggs. I saved\r\nthem just for her. Why didn’t she take them?”\r\n\r\n“Two eggs in the middle of the month!” the mother exclaimed. “That is\r\nunheard of. One egg at the first of each month. That is all we are\r\nallowed.”\r\n\r\n“But if the eggs are a present from America?” Sally insisted.\r\n\r\n“Oh! That is different.” The woman’s face beamed.\r\n\r\n“Then you and Mary shall each have an extra egg.” Sally placed them on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“May God bless you.” The woman was close to tears.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Danny’s mother, once they were on the street, “is why we\r\ncame.”\r\n\r\n“All those ships,” Sally exclaimed, “and all safe! I’ve been told that\r\nour convoy brought three shiploads of food.”\r\n\r\n“Food will win the war,” said Nancy. “We’ll come again.”\r\n\r\nSally’s impatience grew with every passing hour. Why weren’t they\r\nheading back? Every hour’s delay seemed a crime, for Danny was still out\r\nthere on the tossing sea. Or was he? She dared still to hope.\r\n\r\n“We’ll be heading back just as soon as we take on fuel and get our\r\nclearance,” said the Captain. “I’m as anxious to be moving as you are.\r\n\r\n“And once we get started, we’ll really make time. When it’s not hampered\r\nby a convoy, our ship can do close to thirty knots. We’ll steer a\r\nstraight course. It won’t be long, once we are on our way.”\r\n\r\nSally did not say: “Long before what?” She knew he meant long before\r\nthey reached the spot where Danny had last been seen.\r\n\r\n“The Skipper never forgets one of his boys,” had been Riggs’s word for\r\nit. “And he never fails to do all he can for them.”\r\n\r\nOn the second day Nancy remained on board, but Sally and Danny’s mother\r\nonce again went ashore.\r\n\r\n“The time will pass quicker that way,” Mrs. Duke said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and while we are in England we should see all we can of the\r\nEnglish people. The more we learn of them the more we’ll know the things\r\nwe’re fighting for.”\r\n\r\nBy mid-afternoon they were ready for a rest. Seeing a throng entering a\r\nservice club, they followed.\r\n\r\nAn entertainment was in progress. A group of Tommies was putting on an\r\namusing skit about life on the African front.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, the band from Sally’s own ship came on the platform\r\nto give the English people a taste of real American swing tunes. They\r\nwere received with hilarious applause.\r\n\r\nThen a beautiful lady in a gorgeous costume mounted the platform and, as\r\na pianist gave her the chords, began to sing. She had a marvelous deep\r\nvoice. Being English and having known the cruel war as only the English\r\npeople do, she sang with power and feeling. The song was entitled “Danny\r\nBoy.”\r\n\r\n“Come on,” Sally whispered with something like a sob. “I can’t listen to\r\nall of that. Let’s get out.”\r\n\r\nThey did hear more, for as they moved down the aisle and out into the\r\nopen air, the words were wafted back to them.\r\n\r\nAfter walking away a little, they sat down on a bench at the edge of a\r\nnarrow square. Neither spoke. There was no need. The rare, bright sun\r\ncame out to bless them. From the harbor came the hoarse call of a ship’s\r\nwhistle. Sally wished it were her own, but knew it was not.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, another sound reached their ears, the rather\r\nhigh-pitched laugh that could only come from the throat of an American.\r\n\r\nSally looked back. It was Erma Stone who had laughed. Her arm was linked\r\nin that of an admiral. She had had a shampoo. Her suit was pressed. She\r\n“looked like a million” and was beaming on the admiral in a dazzling\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“Life is strange,” Sally whispered to her white-haired companion.\r\n\r\n“Yes, child,” was the solemn reply. “Very, very strange.”\r\n\r\nThat night Sally was awakened by the throb of the ship’s motors. They\r\nwere on their way back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER TWENTY\r\n\r\n                          A GLEAM FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she lay there in her berth, still too tired and dreamy to do more\r\nthan think, all the events of the past few months seemed to pass in\r\nreview before her mind’s eye.\r\n\r\nShe saw herself a normal young lady in a normal, slightly humdrum world,\r\ngoing her regular daily rounds, work at the shop during the day, dinner\r\nwith her father at night, and after that an easy chair and a book,\r\nvaried now and then by a party or a ride in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n“Some life!” she whispered. Had it been? She did not really know. She\r\nfound herself longing for it now in a dreamy sort of way. But would she\r\nbe happy there now? She doubted that.\r\n\r\nAnd then again she saw herself at the great airport, directing huge\r\nbombers and other planes to their places on the field. With Silent Storm\r\nas her guide, instructor, and friend, she had lived a happy life. The\r\nwork she had been doing had been important, very important. One false\r\nmove, one misdirected training bomber and a dozen fine young men from\r\nColorado, Vermont, Illinois—might have gone crashing to earth.\r\n\r\n“Silent Storm,” she whispered. “A grand friend. Barbara, a good, staunch\r\npal. I am going back to them.” The speedy aircraft carrier seemed to\r\nfairly leap along, carrying her home to America.\r\n\r\n“Shall I stay there always?” she asked herself.\r\n\r\nTo this question she found no certain answer. Probably she would not be\r\nthe one to answer that question. This trip, made by a dozen WAVES, had\r\nbeen an experiment. Had it been successful? Would it be repeated? She\r\ncould not tell.\r\n\r\nShe found herself hoping it might be, for the good of others as well as\r\nherself. The Captain had told her that on this trip his men had been\r\nhappier, steadier, more contented than ever before.\r\n\r\n“Ladies add a touch to every organization that can be had in no other\r\nway.” That was his way of putting it.\r\n\r\nOn shore in the harbor city many fine American boys were located. She\r\nhad talked to some of them. One boy had said:\r\n\r\n“You don’t know what it means to meet an honest-to-goodness American\r\ngirl over here.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” she asked herself now, almost fiercely. “If the boys can die\r\nfor their country, why not the girls as well? Thousands of good English\r\nwomen died in the terrible bombings, but the others never faltered.”\r\n\r\nYes, she was sure that she wanted to stay with the ship, to sail the\r\nsea, to do her bit, to fight and die if need be for her beloved land.\r\nBut would they let her? Only time could tell.\r\n\r\nAfter listening in vain for any sound of enemy subs, she drew on slacks,\r\nslippers, and a heavy bathrobe, and went out on the deck. As she passed\r\nalong toward the ladder leading to the flight deck above, she saw\r\ngunners standing like wax statues by their guns.\r\n\r\n“There won’t be any subs tonight,” she paused to whisper. “I have had my\r\nradio on for half an hour. Not a sound.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” was the low response. “But the Skipper isn’t taking any\r\nchances.”\r\n\r\n“Boy! We gave them subs plenty, comin’ over,” came from another statue.\r\n“I’ll bet we got twenty of them.”\r\n\r\n“Not that many, Old Kentuck,” said another statue. “But plenty. And they\r\nsay it’s on account of one of them WAVES having some queer sort of\r\nradio. Great little dame, I’d say.”\r\n\r\n“Sure brought us a lot of luck!” said the first shadow.\r\n\r\n“They haven’t recognized me!” Sally thought, feeling all sort of good\r\ninside. “And I won’t tell them. That would spoil it. I’ve always thought\r\nit would be fun to be famous, if nobody ever found it out.” Wrapping her\r\nrobe a little more tightly about her, she climbed the ladder to the\r\nflight deck where she could get a better view of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe view was worth the climb. Riding high, the moon had painted a path\r\nof gold across the sea. They were heading into the wind. They cut across\r\nlong lines of low waves. All this made the boat seem to race like mad\r\nover the sea.\r\n\r\n“It won’t be long now,” she whispered. Then her heart sank. “Three\r\ndays,” the Old Man had said. “Three days and we’ll be near the spot\r\nwhere Danny was last seen.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danny Boy!” she sang softly. “Oh, Danny Boy!”\r\n\r\nSomething stirred. She turned about. Danny’s mother stood beside her.\r\n\r\n“I—I’m sorry,” she said. “I didn’t know you were there or I wouldn’t\r\nhave sung it.”\r\n\r\n“It was lovely,” the white-haired woman’s voice was low. “Out here where\r\nyou can catch the full sweep of the sea, he seems very near tonight. I\r\nwish you would sing it all.”\r\n\r\nSo again, softly, Sally began to sing: “Oh, Danny Boy.”\r\n\r\n“He is in God’s hands tonight, and God’s hands are good hands,” said the\r\nmother. “No matter whether Danny comes back or not, I want to stay with\r\nDanny’s ship—at least until the ship goes down to be with Danny.”\r\n\r\nFor some time after that they stood there in silence, looking away at\r\nthe sea and at the path of gold that seemed to lead to Danny.\r\n\r\nFrom that night on, to Sally, every throb of the great ship’s engines\r\nseemed to be the beating of a mighty heart, a throbbing that each hour\r\nbrought them nearer to a spot where they might have a tryst with life or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOn the second night, as she stood alone on the upper deck, now watching\r\nthe dark waters swirl by, and now lifting her face to the sky where a\r\nmillion stars shone, she was joined by the Skipper.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” she said after a few moments of talk, “where’s your lady\r\nyeoman? I haven’t seen her since we left port. Is she ill?”\r\n\r\n“No-oo,” he rumbled. “Miss Stone isn’t with us anymore. I traded her to\r\nan admiral for a young man and two very fine old French etchings. I like\r\nthe etchings. They just hang on the wall and don’t say a thing.” He\r\nlaughed in a dry sort of way.\r\n\r\n“But Miss Stone must have been a good yeoman. She gave up a very fine\r\nposition to join the WAVES,” Sally suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s true, she did. But in this man’s war, in fact any war, it’s\r\nnot the wonderful things you have done in the past; it’s what you can do\r\nnow that counts.\r\n\r\n“‘Not to the strong is the battle,’” he quoted. “‘Not to the swift is\r\nthe race, but to the true and the faithful.’\r\n\r\n“The faithful, always the faithful, Sally,” he repeated. “Most of the\r\ngirls we took on trial have been very fine. You, Sally, and your pal,\r\nNancy, may stay on my ship as long as she flies the Stars and Stripes\r\nand sails the seas. I’ll even offer you the honor of going over her side\r\nwith me when the subs get her and she prepares to sink beneath the\r\nwaves.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll never get her,” Sally declared stoutly, “but, Captain, I wish\r\nto thank you from deep in my heart. Those are the finest words I’ve ever\r\nheard spoken.”\r\n\r\n“They were spoken from the heart, Sally.”\r\n\r\nFor a time after that they were silent, then Sally spoke in a deep\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Captain, do you really think we’ll find Danny?”\r\n\r\n“Only time will tell. We have taken account of wind and tide, done\r\neverything we could. When we think we have located the approximate spot,\r\nwe’ll heave to and send out a full complement of planes to search for\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“But the storm?” she whispered hoarsely. “It seems impossible.”\r\n\r\n“From reports I have received, I am led to believe that the storm may\r\nnot have passed over Danny’s part of the ocean. It was a tropical storm,\r\nviolent in intensity, but narrow in scope.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she breathed. “If that is only true. If it is—”\r\n\r\n“It won’t be long now, Sally. Tonight we’ll say a prayer for Danny.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s do,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” she spoke again, “when the planes go out on the search, may\r\nDanny’s pal, Fred, fly a two-seater and may I ride in the second seat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sally, you just tell Fred I said he must take you for luck.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later she was back in her quarters, saying her prayer for\r\nDanny.\r\n\r\nThe hour came at last when, on a wide open sea, the big ship came to a\r\nhalt, turned half about to give the planes the advantage of the wind,\r\nthen stood by while, one by one, they roared away.\r\n\r\n“This is the beginning of the end,” Sally thought as she strapped on her\r\nparachute. Would it be a sad or a happy ending? She dared not hazard a\r\nguess. She did not dare to hope.\r\n\r\nTheir plane was slower in its upward climb than any that had gone\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Our plane seems tired,” she said to Fred.\r\n\r\n“That’s because I’m carrying an extra gas tank lashed to the fuselage,”\r\nhe explained. “We may not find Danny, but we’ll be the last ones back\r\nfrom the search.”\r\n\r\nAfter sailing aloft, they began to circle, while with powerful\r\nbinoculars Sally searched the sea for some sign, a speck of white, a\r\ndark, drifting object, just anything that spoke of life.\r\n\r\nAs the moments passed, their circle grew ever wider. Slowly, the big\r\nship faded into the distance.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, with eager eyes, Sally lifted her glasses to scan the\r\nsky and count the planes slowly soaring there. She hoped against hope\r\nthat one of these might show some sign of an all important discovery,\r\nbut still they circled on.\r\n\r\nAt last she saw them, one by one, start winging their way back toward\r\nthe carrier.\r\n\r\n“Their gas is about gone,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“Will they refuel and come back?” Sally asked. There was a choke in her\r\nvoice and an ache in her heart.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” was the solemn reply. “That’s up to the big chief.”\r\n\r\n“Danny’s out here somewhere,” she insisted. “He just must be.” Still\r\nthey circled on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sally cried: “Look! Fred! Way off there to the left! There’s a\r\nbright gleam on the water!”\r\n\r\n“A sun spot,” was the quiet response. “We often see them on the water.\r\nYou don’t think Danny would set fire to his raft, do you?”\r\n\r\n“No, but Fred!” She gripped his arm in her excitement. “I read about it\r\nin a magazine.”\r\n\r\n“Read what?”\r\n\r\n“About some chemical. I can’t remember the name. When you pour it on the\r\nwater it throws back the light of the sun, makes the water shine.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Yes, Fred! It’s true! At first the chemical didn’t work so well. It\r\ndisappeared too soon, but they mixed it with other chemicals, then it\r\nlasted for a long time. They were going to put small bottles of it on\r\nthe rubber rafts. It just must be true!” She pounded him on the back.\r\n\r\n“We’ll soon know.” He headed the plane toward that gleaming spot.\r\n\r\nFor a time the light gleamed brightly, then it began to fade.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it can’t fail us!” Sally whispered. “It just can’t! It’s our last\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\nAnd it did not fail them, for, as Sally watched through her binoculars,\r\na dark spot appeared at the center of the fading light.\r\n\r\n“It’s Danny!” she cried. “It just has to be!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was. The small bottle of chemicals was not a dream but a blessed\r\nreality. Danny had discovered it and had used it at just the right time.\r\n\r\nAs they circled low, he stood up and waved excitedly.\r\n\r\nFred got off a message to the boat. They promised to send a fast power\r\nboat to the spot at once. After that there was nothing left to do but\r\ncircle over the spot and wait.\r\n\r\nAs Sally’s eye caught the gray spot that was the rescue boat, a sudden\r\nimpulse seized her.\r\n\r\n“Fred, I’m going to jump,” she said.\r\n\r\n“What? Take to the parachute? Why? We’ve got plenty of gas for getting\r\nback to the ship.”\r\n\r\n“All the same I’m going to jump. I want to be with Danny when the boat\r\narrives. Nothing will happen to me. I’ve done it before.” Sally pulled\r\noff her shoes.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he agreed. “But wait until the boat is almost here.”\r\n\r\nImpatiently Sally waited. At last she said, “Now! Here I go!”\r\n\r\nOver the side she went. She pulled the ripcord. The parachute opened,\r\nthen she went drifting down. Her aim had been good. She hit the water\r\nnot a hundred yards from Danny’s raft.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing herself from her parachute she went into the Australian\r\ncrawl and soon was there at the raft’s side.\r\n\r\nDanny would have welcomed anyone after his long days on the sea, but to\r\nhave Sally drop from the sky seemed too good to be true. Danny’s pet sea\r\nparrot, however, was not so friendly. He had become very fond of Danny,\r\nparticularly fond of his dried fish. He didn’t propose to have anyone\r\ncome between him and Danny, so, with his vice-like beak, he had taken a\r\nfirm grip on one of Sally’s pink toes.\r\n\r\nBy the time Danny had settled the quarrel between Sally and his pet, the\r\nboat was at their side.\r\n\r\n“Danny, are you all right?” his mother cried from the boat.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure! Fit as a fiddle, and I have lots more brain cells. I’ve been\r\nliving on fish.” He laughed gaily.\r\n\r\nWhen the raft, the pet sea parrot, all Danny’s dried fish and, of\r\ncourse, Danny and Sally, had been taken aboard, the boat headed for the\r\ncarrier.\r\n\r\n“Danny,” Sally asked, “how did you ever ride out that storm?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She Hit the Water Near Danny’s Raft]\r\n\r\n“That? Why that was easy,” was his smiling reply. “You see, I didn’t\r\nreally get the worst of it, just the aftermath, big rolling waves, high\r\nas a church, just rolling and rolling. I went to the top of one, slid\r\ndown its side, then started up another. Talk about your roller coaster.\r\nSay! That’s tame!”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, both Sally and Danny ate at the Captain’s table that\r\nnight. When Danny had told of his glorious fishing expedition, when\r\nSally had added the story of the rescue, and the sea parrot had screamed\r\nhis approval, the applause that followed made the bulkheads ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\r\n\r\n                                 DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment they were tied up at the dock in their home port Captain\r\nMacQueen got in touch with Silent Storm.\r\n\r\n“I understand you know this inventor C. K. Kennedy,” he said over the\r\nphone. “How well do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“Quite well, I think,” was Storm’s modest reply.\r\n\r\n“Fine,” said MacQueen. “How about having dinner with my friend, Sally,\r\nand me tonight?”\r\n\r\n“That will be a pleasure,” said Silent Storm, sensing at once that\r\nsomething big regarding Sally’s secret radio was in the offing. “But why\r\ndon’t we have the dinner at my house? It’s quiet and very secret.”\r\n\r\n“That’s okay with me,” was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n“Make it seven o’clock,” said Storm.\r\n\r\n“Sally and I will be there.” And they were.\r\n\r\nWhen Sally had enjoyed one more delightful dinner in the Storm home she\r\nwas led away once more to Silent Storm’s secret den. There, over black\r\ncoffee, the three of them talked over the future.\r\n\r\n“I have asked you to take a part in this,” Captain MacQueen said to\r\nStorm, “because you are an old friend of C. K. Kennedy and will,\r\nperhaps, know the best manner in which to approach him. This matter of\r\nthe secret radio is one of great importance. And we cannot forget that\r\nhe alone holds the secret of its extraordinary performance.”\r\n\r\n“You overestimate my influence,” was Storm’s reply. “Wouldn’t Sally do\r\nquite as well?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” the Captain admitted, “but in battles of major importance I\r\nbring up all my forces. What I want to propose is that Sally, you, and I\r\ntake a plane to Washington—our ship is to be tied up long enough for\r\nthis—that we pick up a rather important Government man there, and that\r\nwe then go on to Sally’s home town to interview Kennedy. What do you\r\nthink of that, Sally?”\r\n\r\n“Sounds all right to me,” said Sally. “I agree with you that Major Storm\r\nwill be a great help.”\r\n\r\n“How about it, Storm?” said the Captain. “Can you arrange for the time\r\noff?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, beyond a doubt it can be arranged,” said Storm.\r\n\r\n“Then we are all set.” Captain MacQueen heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nThe rest of that evening was given over to telling of the aircraft\r\ncarrier’s journey and the important part the secret radio had played in\r\nthe winning of her battles. When he had heard the story Silent Storm was\r\nmore than eager to accompany them on their journey to the home of the\r\ngreat inventor.\r\n\r\n“One thing must be understood from the start,” he said as the Skipper\r\nand Sally prepared to leave. “That is that I am a real friend of old C.\r\nK. and of Sally as well. If there are negotiations going on for old C.\r\nK.’s secret, I shall act, in a way, as his lawyer.”\r\n\r\n“And you will see that he is treated fairly,” said the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Not only that, but I shall see that he knows that he is being treated\r\nfairly,” Storm amended.\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I had hoped for,” the Captain agreed.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, with Danny as co-pilot for a big twin-motored plane,\r\nthey set off on their journey. Twenty-four hours later they were\r\nknocking at the door of the modest shop where the secret radio had first\r\nseen the light of day.\r\n\r\n“Sally!” the aged inventor exclaimed at sight of her. “I’m glad to see\r\nyou! But how is it that you are back so soon?”\r\n\r\n“These men can tell you more about that than I can.” Sally was beaming.\r\n“You know Major Storm.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes indeed!” The two men shook hands.\r\n\r\nThe other men were introduced and then, seated on rustic benches and\r\nchairs, they told the delighted old man the story of his secret radio.\r\n\r\n“Sally, you have done all that I hoped and much more,” he exclaimed.\r\nThere were tears in his eyes. “I shall never forget.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just fine,” said Sally, rising a bit unsteadily to her feet.\r\n“I—I’m glad you are happy. And now I am going to leave you men to\r\nfinish the business of the hour. I promised to show Danny our river.”\r\n\r\n“Danny?” the old man laughed happily. “So you’ve got you a Danny? Well\r\nthen, run along. I wouldn’t keep you for the world.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long, delightful tramp over the river trail, Sally and Danny\r\ncame to rest on a rustic bench overlooking the river.\r\n\r\n“It’s really slow and peaceful,” Sally murmured.\r\n\r\n“I’ll say it is, after what we’ve gone through,” Danny agreed. “My hands\r\nfairly ache for the controls of my plane.”\r\n\r\n“Hands,” said Sally, with a sly smile, “are sometimes used for other\r\npurposes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right, they are,” Danny exclaimed, seizing Sally’s hand. Sally\r\ndidn’t mind, so they sat there for a time in silence.\r\n\r\nThen came the sound of voices. “They are looking for us,” said Sally.\r\n“Time for a crash landing.” She pulled her hand away.\r\n\r\n“So here you are!” Captain MacQueen said a moment later.\r\n\r\n“Well, folks,” said Silent Storm, “everything is arranged. The\r\nGovernment gets the secret radio and your old-friend C. K. gets a\r\nliberal payment.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Sally, are to receive half of it,” said the Captain.\r\n\r\n“What!” Sally sprang to her feet. “Why! That’s unfair!”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t see it that way,” Storm replied quietly. “He felt that you\r\nhave done more than he to make the radio a success. I advise that you\r\naccept his offer and allow things to stand as they are. It is for the\r\ngood of your country as well as yourself, and there will be plenty for\r\nyou both, I assure you.” Sally settled back in her place.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she admitted, “it will be a good opportunity to help my country\r\nin another way. I’ll invest it in War Bonds right away. C. K. will\r\nreally be aiding our nation in that way, then, too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Captain, “that is true. Kennedy wants you to have the\r\nbungalow you have always dreamed of, when peace has come again.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t that be sweet?” Sally said, turning to Danny with a teasing\r\nsmile. Danny said never a word.\r\n\r\n“And C. K. wants you to come back to work with him as soon as the war is\r\nover,” Storm said with a grin.\r\n\r\nOnce more Sally turned to Danny. This time he spoke. “That,” he said,\r\n“will need a lot of thinking about.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, for Sally, life seemed fairly well begun.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                WHITMAN\r\n                             BOYS’ FICTION\r\n\r\n                       ADVENTURE—THRILLS—MYSTERY\r\n\r\nFollow your Favorite Characters through page after page of Thrilling\r\nAdventures.
