An inferior group passes through the centre of the island,\r\ndiverging towards the South, as it approaches the East coast. Between\r\nthe two ranges, and completely separated from them by the valleys of\r\nthe Alcantara and the Simeto, stands the mighty mass of Mount Etna,\r\nwhich rises in solitary grandeur from the eastern sea-board of the\r\nisland. Volcanoes, by the very mode of their formation, are frequently\r\ncompletely isolated; and, if they are of any magnitude, they thus\r\nacquire an imposing contour and a majesty, which larger mountains,\r\nforming parts of a chain, do not possess. This specially applies to\r\nEtna. \"Coelebs degit,\" says Cardinal Bembo, \"et nullius montis dignata\r\nconjugium, caste intra suos terminos continetur.\" It is not alone the\r\nconspicuous appearance of the mountain which has made it the most famous\r\nvolcano either of ancient or modern times:--the number and violence of\r\nits eruptions, the extent of its lava streams, its association with\r\nantiquity, and its history prolonged over more than 2400 years, have all\r\ntended to make it celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of Etna was first accurately determined by\r\nCaptain Smyth in 1814. He estimated the latitude of the highest point of\r\nthe bifid peak of the great crater at 37° 43' 31\" N.; and the longitude\r\nat 15° East of Greenwich. Elie de Beaumont repeated the observations in\r\n1834 with nearly the same result; and these determinations have been\r\nvery generally adopted. In the new Italian map recently constructed by\r\nthe Stato Maggiore, the latitude of the centre of the crater is stated\r\nto be 37° 44' 55\" N., and the longitude 44' 55\" E. of the meridian of\r\nNaples, which passes through the Observatory of Capo di Monte.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bochart the name of Etna is derived from the Phoenician\r\n_athana_--a furnace; others derive it from ~aithô~--to burn.\r\nProfessor Benfey of Gottingen, a great authority on the subject,\r\nconsiders that the word was created by one of the early Indo-Germanic\r\nraces. He identifies the root _ait_ with the Greek ~aith~ and the\r\nLatin _aed_--to burn, as in _aes_-tu. The Greek name ~Aitna~ was\r\nknown to Hesiod. The more modern name, _Mongibello_, by which the\r\nmountain is still commonly known to the Sicilians, is a combination of\r\nthe Arabic _Gibel_, and the Italian _Monte_. During the Saracenic\r\noccupation of Sicily, Etna was called _Gibel Uttamat_--the mountain of\r\nfire; and the last syllables of Mongibello are a relic of the Saracenic\r\nname. A mountain near Palermo is still called Gibel Rosso--the red\r\nmountain; and names may not unfrequently be found in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Etna which are partly, or sometimes even entirely,\r\ncomposed of Arabic words; such, for example, as _Alcantara_--the river\r\nof _the bridge_. Etna is also often spoken of distinctively as _Il\r\nMonte_--the mountain _par excellence_; a name which, in its capacity of\r\nthe largest mountain in the kingdom of Italy, and the loftiest volcano\r\nin Europe, it fully justifies.\r\n\r\nEtna is frequently alluded to by classical writers. By the poets it was\r\nsometimes feigned to be the prison of the giant Enceladus or Typhon,\r\nsometimes the forge of Hephaistos, and the abode of the Cyclops.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Homer, who has so minutely described certain portions\r\nof the contiguous Sicilian coast, does not allude to Etna. This has been\r\nthought by some to be a proof that the mountain was in a quiescent state\r\nduring the period which preceded and coincided with the time of Homer.\r\n\r\nPindar (B.C. 522-442) is the first writer of antiquity who has described\r\nEtna. In the first of the Pythian Odes for Hieron, of the town of Aitna,\r\nwinner in the chariot race in B.C. 474, he exclaims:\r\n\r\n... \"He (Typhon) is fast bound by a pillar of the sky, even by snowy\r\nEtna, nursing the whole year's length her dazzling snow. Whereout pure\r\nsprings of unapproachable fire are vomited from the inmost depths: in\r\nthe daytime the lava-streams pour forth a lurid rush of smoke; but in\r\nthe darkness a red rolling flame sweepeth rocks with uproar to the wide\r\ndeep sea.... That dragon-thing (Typhon) it is that maketh issue from\r\nbeneath the terrible fiery flood.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Translated by Ernest Myers, M.A., 1874.\r\n\r\nÆschylus (B.C. 525-456) speaks also of the \"mighty Typhon,\"\r\n(_Prometheus_ V.):\r\n\r\n                            . . . . . \"He lies\r\n    A helpless, powerless carcase, near the strait\r\n    Of the great sea, fast pressed beneath the roots\r\n    Of ancient Etna, where on highest peak\r\n    Hephæstos sits and smites his iron red hot,\r\n    From whence hereafter streams of fire shall burst,\r\n    Devouring with fierce jaws the golden plains\r\n    Of fruitful, fair Sikelia.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Translated by E. Myers.\r\n\r\nHerein he probably refers to the eruption which had occurred a few years\r\npreviously (B.C. 476).\r\n\r\nThucydides (B.C. 471-402) alludes in the last lines of the Third Book to\r\nseveral early eruptions of the mountain in the following terms: \"In the\r\nfirst days of this spring, the stream of fire issued from Etna, as on\r\nformer occasions, and destroyed some land of the Catanians, who live\r\nupon Mount Etna, which is the largest mountain in Sicily. Fifty years,\r\nit is said, had elapsed since the last eruption, there having been three\r\nin all since the Hellenes have inhabited Sicily.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Translated by E. Crawley.\r\n\r\nVirgil's oft-quoted description of the mountain (_Eneid_, Bk. 3) we give\r\nin the spirited translation of Conington:\r\n\r\n    \"But Etna with her voice of fear\r\n    In weltering chaos thunders near.\r\n    Now pitchy clouds she belches forth\r\n    Of cinders red, and vapour swarth;\r\n    And from her caverns lifts on high\r\n    Live balls of flame that lick the sky:\r\n    Now with more dire convulsion flings\r\n    Disploded rocks, her heart's rent strings,\r\n    And lava torrents hurls to-day\r\n    A burning gulf of fiery spray.\"\r\n\r\nMany other early writers speak of the mountain, among them Theokritos,\r\nAristotle, Ovid, Livy, Seneca, Lucretius, Pliny, Lucan, Petronius,\r\nCornelius Severus, Dion Cassius, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Lucilius\r\nJunior. Seneca makes various allusions to Etna, and mentions the fact\r\nthat lightning sometimes proceeded from its smoke.\r\n\r\nStrabo has given a very fair description of the mountain. He asserts\r\nthat in his time the upper part of it was bare, and covered with ashes,\r\nand in winter with snow, while the lower slopes were clothed with\r\nforests. The summit was a plain about twenty stadia in circumference,\r\nsurrounded by a ridge, within which there was a small hillock, the smoke\r\nfrom which ascended to a considerable height. He further mentions a\r\nsecond crater. Etna was commonly ascended in Strabo's time from the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nWhile the poets on the one hand had invested the mountain with various\r\nsupernatural attributes, and had made it the prison-house of a chained\r\ngiant, and the workshop of a swart god, Lucretius endeavoured to show\r\nthat the eruptions and other phenomena could be easily explained by the\r\nordinary operations of nature. \"And now at last,\" he writes, \"I will\r\nexplain in what ways yon flame, roused to fury in a moment, blazes forth\r\nfrom the huge furnaces of Aetna. And, first, the nature of the whole\r\nmountain is hollow underneath, underpropped throughout with caverns of\r\nbasalt rocks. Furthermore, in all caves are wind and air, for wind is\r\nproduced when the air has been stirred and put in motion. When this air\r\nhas been thoroughly heated, and, raging about, has imparted its heat to\r\nall the rocks around, wherever it comes in contact with them, and to the\r\nearth, and has struck out from them fire burning with swift flames, it\r\nrises up and then forces itself out on high, straight through the\r\ngorges; and so carries its heat far, and scatters far its ashes, and\r\nrolls on smoke of a thick pitchy blackness, and flings out at the same\r\ntime stones of prodigious weight--leaving no doubt that this is the\r\nstormy force of air. Again, the sea, to a great extent, breaks its waves\r\nand sucks back its surf at the roots of that mountain. Caverns reach\r\nfrom this sea as far as the deep gorges of the mountain below. Through\r\nthese you must admit [that air mixed up with water passes; and] the\r\nnature of the case compels [this air to enter in from that] open sea,\r\nand pass right within, and then go out in blasts, and so lift up flame,\r\nand throw out stones, and raise clouds of sand; for on the summit are\r\ncraters, as they name them in their own language, what we call gorges\r\nand mouths.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4] _De Naturâ Rerum_, Book 6, p. 580. Translated by E. Munro 1864.\r\n\r\nThese ideas were developed by Lucilius Junior in a poem consisting of\r\n644 hexameters entitled _Aetna_. The authorship of this poem has long\r\nbeen a disputed point; it has been attributed to Virgil, Claudian,\r\nQuintilius Varus, Manilius, and, by Joseph Scaliger[5] and others, to\r\nCornelius Severus. Wensdorff was the first to adduce reasons for\r\nattributing the poem to Lucilius Junior, and his views are generally\r\nadopted. Lucilius Junior was Procurator of Sicily under Nero, and, while\r\nresident in the Island, he ascended Etna; and it is said that he\r\nproposed writing a detailed history of the mountain. He adopted the\r\nscientific opinions of Epicurus, as established in Rome by Lucretius,\r\nand was more immediately a disciple of Seneca. The latter dedicated to\r\nhim his _Quæstiones Naturales_, in which he alludes more than once to\r\nEtna. M. Chenu speaks of the poem of Lucilius Junior as \"sans doute\r\ntrès-póetique, mais assez souvent dur, heurté, concis, et parcela même,\r\nd'une obscurité parfois désespérante.\"[6] At the commencement of the\r\npoem, Lucilius ridicules the ideas of the poets as regards the\r\nconnection of Etna with Vulcan and the Cyclops. He has no belief in the\r\npractice, which apparently prevailed in his time, of ascending to the\r\nedge of the crater and there offering incense to the tutelary gods of\r\nthe mountain. He adopts to a great extent the tone and style of\r\nLucretius, in his explanation of the phenomena of the mountain. Water\r\nfilters through the crevices and cracks in the rocks, until it comes\r\ninto contact with the internal fires, when it is converted into vapour\r\nand expelled with violence. The internal fires are nourished by the\r\nwinds which penetrate into the mountain. He traces some curious\r\nconnection between the plants which grow upon the mountain, and the\r\nsupply of sulphur and bitumen to the interior, which is, at best, but\r\npartly intelligible.\r\n\r\n[5] See Lucilius Junioris AETNA.

Traduction nouvelle par Jules Chenu.\r\nParis, 1843.\r\n\r\n    \"Nunc superant, quacunque regant incendia silvæ\r\n    Quæ flammis alimenta vacent, quid nutriat Aetnam.\r\n    Incendi patiens illis vernacula caulis\r\n    Materia, appositumque igni genus utile terræ est,\r\n    Uritur assidue calidus nunc sulfuris humor,\r\n    Nunc spissus crebro præbetur flumine succus,\r\n    Pingue bitumen adest, et quidquid cominus acres\r\n    Irritat flammas; illius corporis Ætna est.\r\n    Atque hanc materiam penitus discurrere fontes\r\n    Infectæ erumpunt et aquæ radice sub ipsa.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the myths developed by the earlier poets had their home in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, sometimes upon the very sides, of Etna--Demeter\r\nseeking Persephone; Acis and Galatea; Polyphemus and the Cyclops. Mr.\r\nSymonds tells us that the one-eyed giant Polyphemus was Etna itself,\r\nwith its one great crater, while the Cyclops were the many minor cones.\r\n\"Persephone was the patroness of Sicily, because amid the billowy\r\ncorn-fields of her mother Demeter, and the meadow-flowers she loved in\r\ngirlhood, are ever found sulphurous ravines, and chasms breathing vapour\r\nfrom the pit of Hades.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Sketches in Italy and Greece, p. 201.\r\n\r\nIt is said that both Plato and the Emperor Hadrian ascended Etna in\r\norder to witness the sunrise from its summit. The story of\r\n\r\n            \"He who to be deemed\r\n    A god, leaped fondly into Etna flames,\r\n    Empedokles\"\r\n\r\nis too trite to need repetition. A ruined tower near the head of the Val\r\ndel Bove, 9,570 feet above the sea, has from time immemorial been called\r\nthe _Torre del Filosofo_, and is asserted to have been the observatory\r\nof Empedokles. Others regard it as the remains of a Roman tower, which\r\nwas possibly erected on the occasion of Hadrian's ascent of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages Etna is frequently alluded to, among others by\r\nDante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Cardinal Bembo. The latter gives a\r\ndescription of the mountain in the form of a dialogue, which Ferrara\r\ncharacterises as \"_erudito, e grecizzante, ma sensa nervi_.\" He\r\ndescribes its general appearance, its well-wooded sides, and sterile\r\nsummit. When he visited the mountain it had two craters about a stone's\r\nthrow apart; the larger of the two was said to be about three miles in\r\ncircumference, and it stood somewhat above the other.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] Petri Bembi DE AETNA. Ad Angelum Chabrielem Liber Impressum Venetiis\r\nAedibus Aldi Romani. Mense Februario anno M.V.D. (1495).\r\n\r\nIn 1541 Fazzello made an ascent of the mountain, which he briefly\r\ndescribes in the fourth chapter of his bulky volume _De Rebus\r\nSiculis_.[9] This chapter is entitled \"_De Aetna monte et ejus\r\nignibus_;\" it contains a short history of the mountain, and some mention\r\nof the principal towns which he enumerates in the following order:\r\nCatana, Tauromenium, Caltabianco, Linguagrossa, Castroleone,\r\nFrancavilla, Rocella, Randatio (Randazzo), Bronte, Adrano, Paterno, and\r\nMotta. Fazzello speaks of only one crater.\r\n\r\n[9] Fazzellus T. DE REBUS SICULIS. Panormi, 1558; folio.\r\n\r\nIn 1591 Antonio Filoteo, who was born on Etna, published a work in\r\nVenice in which he describes the general features of the mountain, and\r\ngives a special account of an eruption which he witnessed in 1536.[10]\r\nThe mountain was then, as now, divided into three _Regions_. The first\r\nand uppermost of these, he asserts, is very arid, rugged, and uneven,\r\nand full of broken rocks; the second is covered with forests; and the\r\nthird is cultivated in the ordinary manner. Of the height he remarks,\r\n\"Ascensum triginta circiter millia passuum ad plus habet.\" In regard to\r\nthe name, _Mongibello_, he makes a curious error, deriving it from\r\n_Mulciber_, one of the names of Vulcan, who, as we have seen, was\r\nfeigned by the earlier poets to have had his forge within the mountain.\r\n\r\n[10] Antonii Philothei de Homodeis Siculi, AETNÆ TOPOGRAPHIA,\r\nincendiorum Aetnæorum Historia. Venetiis. 1591. Preface dated September,\r\n1590.\r\n\r\nIn 1636 Carrera gave an account of Etna, followed by that of the Jesuit\r\nKircher, in 1638. The great eruption of 1669 was described at length by\r\nvarious eye-witnesses, and furnished the subject of the first detailed\r\ndescription of the eruptive phenomena of the mountain. Public attention\r\nwas now very generally drawn to the subject in all civilised countries.\r\nIt was described by the naturalist, Borelli, and in our own\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_. Lord Winchelsea, our ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, was returning to England by way of the Straits of\r\nMessina at the time of the eruption, and he forwarded to Charles II \"A\r\ntrue and exact relation of the late prodigious earthquake and eruption\r\nof Mount Ætna, or Monte Gibello.\"\r\n\r\nThe first map of the mountain which we have been able to meet with,\r\nwas published in reference to the eruption of 1669; it is entitled,\r\n\"Plan du Mont Etna communenent dit Mount Gibel en l'Isle de Scicille\r\net de t'incedie arrive par un treblement de terre le 8me Mars dernier\r\n1669.\" This plan is in the Bibliothèque Nationale, in Paris; it was\r\nprobably drawn from a simple description, or perhaps altogether from\r\nthe imagination, as it is utterly unlike the mountain, the sides of\r\nwhich possess an impossible steepness. Another very inaccurate map was\r\npublished in Nuremberg about 1680, annexed to a map of Sicily, which\r\nis entitled, \"_Regnorum Siciliæ et Sardiniæ, Nova Tabula_.\" Again, in\r\n1714 H. Moll, \"geographer in Devereux Street, Strand,\" published a new\r\nmap of Italy, in which there is a representation of Etna during the\r\neruption of 1669. This also was probably drawn from the imagination;\r\nno one who has ever seen the mountain would recognise it, for it has\r\na small base, and sides which rival the Matterhorn in abruptness.\r\nOver against the coast of Sicily, and near the mountain, is\r\nwritten:--\"Mount Etna, or Mount Gibello. This mountain sometimes\r\nissues out pure flame, and at other times a thick smoak with ashes;\r\nstreams of fire run down with great quantities of burning stones, and\r\nhas made many eruptions.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century Etna was frequently ascended, and as\r\nfrequently described. We have the accounts of Massa (1703), Count\r\nD'Orville (1727), Riedesel (1767), Sir William Hamilton (1769), Brydone\r\n(1776), Houel (1786), Dolomieu (1788), Spallanzani (1790), and many\r\nminor writers, such as Borch, Brocchi, Swinburne, Denon, and Faujas de\r\nSaint Fond. There is great sameness in all of these narratives, and much\r\nrepetition of the same facts; some of them, however, merit a passing\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton's _Campi Phlegræi_ relates mainly to Vesuvius and\r\nthe surrounding neighbourhood; but one of the letters \"addressed to the\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society on October 17th, 1769,\" describes an\r\nascent of Etna. Hamilton ascended on June 24th with the Canon Recupero\r\nand other companions; the few observations of any value which he made\r\nhave been alluded to elsewhere under the head of the special subjects to\r\nwhich they refer. The illustrations of the _Campi Phlegræi_, specially\r\nthe original water-colours which are contained in one of the British\r\nMuseum copies, are magnificent, and convey a better idea of volcanic\r\nphenomena than any amount of simple reading. From them we can well\r\nrealise the opening of a long rift extending down the sides of a\r\nmountain during its eruption, and the formation of subsidiary craters\r\nalong the line of fire thus opened. Various volcanic products are also\r\nadmirably painted. In the picture of Etna, however, which was drawn by\r\nAntonio Fabris, the artist has scarcely been more successful than his\r\npredecessors, and the slope of the sides of the mountain has been\r\ngreatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nM. Houel, in his _Voyage pittoresque dans les Deux Siciles_, 1781-1786,\r\nhas given a fairly good account of Etna, accompanied by some really\r\nexcellent engravings.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Patrick Brydone, a clever Irishman with a good deal of native\r\nshrewdness and humour, published two volumes of a _Tour in Sicily and\r\nMalta_, in which he devoted several chapters to Mount Etna. He made the\r\nascent of the mountain, and collected from the Canon Recupero, and from\r\nothers, many facts concerning its then present, and its past history. He\r\nalso made observations as to the height, temperature of the air at\r\nvarious elevations, brightness of the stars, and so on. Sir William\r\nHamilton calls Brydone \"a very ingenious and accurate observer,\" and\r\nadds that he was well acquainted with Alpine measurements. M. Elie de\r\nBeaumont, writing in 1836, speaks of him as _le celebre Brydone_; while,\r\non the other hand, the Abbé Spallanzani, displeased at certain remarks\r\nwhich he made concerning Roman Catholicism in Sicily, never fails to\r\ndeprecate his work, and deplores \"his trivial and insipid pleasantries.\"\r\nAlbeit Brydone's chapters on Etna furnished a more complete account of\r\nthe volcano than any which had appeared in English up to that time; his\r\nremarks are frequently very sound and just, and we shall have occasion\r\nmore than once to quote him.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved, however, for the Abate Francesco Ferrara, Professor of\r\nPhysical Science in the University of Catania, to furnish the first\r\nhistory of Etna and of its eruptions, which had any just claim to\r\ncompleteness. It is entitled, _Descrizione dell' Etna, con la Storia\r\ndelle Eruzioni e il Catalogo del prodotti_. The first edition appeared\r\nin 1793, and a second was printed in Palermo in 1818. The author had an\r\nenthusiastic love for his subject:--\"Nato sopra l'Etna,\" he writes, \"che\r\nio conobbi ben presto palmo a palmo la mia passione per lo studio fissò\r\nla mia attenzione sul bello, e terribile fenomeno che avea avanti agli\r\nocchi.\" The work commences with a general description of the\r\nmountain--its height, the temperature of the different regions, the view\r\nfrom the summit, the mass, the water-springs, the vegetable and animal\r\nlife, and the internal fires. This extends over sixty-nine octavo pages.\r\nThe second part of the book--eighty pages--gives a history of the\r\neruptions from the earliest times to the year 1811; the third\r\npart--sixty-seven pages--treats of the nature of the volcanic products;\r\nand the fourth part--thirty-four pages--discusses certain geological and\r\nphysical considerations concerning the mountain. At the end there are a\r\nfew badly drawn and engraved woodcuts, and a map which, although the\r\ntrend of the coast-line is quite wrong, is otherwise fairly good. The\r\nengravings represent the mountain as seen from Catania; the Isole dei\r\nCiclopi, and the neighbouring coast; the Montagna della Motta; and a\r\nview from Catania of the eruption of 1787. This work has evidently to a\r\ngreat extent been a labour of love; it is full of personal observations,\r\nand also embodies the results of many other observers. It has furnished\r\nthe foundation of much that has since been written concerning Etna.\r\n\r\nThe Canon Recupero has been alluded to above; he accompanied Hamilton,\r\nBrydone, and others to the summit of the mountain, and he was employed\r\nby the Government to report on the flood which, in 1755, descended with\r\nextraordinary violence through the Val del Bove. Beyond this, Recupero\r\ndoes not appear to have published anything concerning Etna, although it\r\nwas well known that he had plenty of materials. He died in 1778, and it\r\nwas not till the year 1815 that his results were published under the\r\ntitle of _Storia Naturale et Generale dell' Etna, del Canonico Giuseppe\r\nRecupero.--Opera Postuma_. This work consists of two bulky quarto\r\nvolumes, the first of which is devoted to a general description of the\r\nmountain, the second to a history of the eruptions, and an account of\r\nthe products of eruptions. Some idea may be formed of the extreme\r\nprolixity of the author if we mention that two chapters, together\r\ncontaining twelve quarto pages, are devoted to the discussion of the\r\nheight of Etna, while the first volume is terminated by sixty-three\r\nclosely printed pages of annotations. A few rough woodcuts accompany the\r\nvolumes; a view of the mountain which, as usual, is out of all reason\r\nas regards abruptness of ascent, and a _carta oryctographia di\r\nMongibello_ in which the trend of the coast-line between Catania and\r\nTaormina is altogether inexact, complete the illustrations of this most\r\ndetailed of histories.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1814-1816 Captain Smyth, acting under orders from the\r\nAdmiralty, made a survey of the coast of Sicily, and of the adjacent\r\nislands. At this time the Mediterranean charts were very defective; some\r\nplaces on the coast of Sicily were mapped as much as twenty miles out of\r\ntheir true position, and even the exact positions of the observatories\r\nat Naples, Palermo, and Malta were not known. Among other results, Smyth\r\ncarefully determined the latitude and longitude of Etna, accurately\r\nmeasured its height, and examined the surroundings of the mountain. His\r\nresults were published in 1824, and are often regarded as the most\r\naccurate that we possess.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Dr. Joseph Gemellaro, who lived all his life on the mountain,\r\nand made it his constant study, published an \"Historical and\r\nTopographical Map of the Eruptions of Etna from the era of the Sicani to\r\nthe year 1824.\" In it he delineates the extent of the three Regions,\r\n_Coltivata_, _Selvosa_, and _Deserta_; he places the minor cones, to the\r\nnumber of seventy-four, in their proper places, and he traces the course\r\nof the various lava-streams which have flowed from them and from the\r\ngreat crater. This map is the result of much patient labour and study,\r\nand it is a great improvement upon those of Ferrara and Recupero, but of\r\ncourse it is impossible for one man to survey with much accuracy an area\r\nof nearly 500 square miles, and to trace the tortuous course of a large\r\nnumber of lava-streams. Hence we must be prepared for inaccuracies, and\r\nthey are not uncommon--the coast line is altogether wrong as to its\r\nbearings, some of the small towns on the sides of the mountain are\r\nmisplaced, and but little attention has been paid to scale. Still the\r\nmap is very useful, as it is the only one which shows the course of the\r\nlava-streams.\r\n\r\nMario Gemellaro, brother of the preceding, made almost daily\r\nobservations of the condition of Etna, between the years 1803 and 1832.\r\nThese results were tabulated, and they are given in the _Vulcanologia\r\ndell' Etna_ of his brother, Professor Carlo Gemellaro, under the title of\r\n_Registro di Osservazioni del Sigr. Mario Gemellaro_.\r\n\r\nCarlo Gemellaro contributed many memoirs on subjects connected with the\r\nmountain. They are chiefly to be found in the _Atti dell' Accademia\r\nGioenia_ of Catania, and they extend over a number of years. Perhaps the\r\nmost important is the treatise entitled \"_La Vulcanologia dell' Etna che\r\ncomprende la Topographia, la Geologia, la Storia, delle sue Eruzioni_.\"\r\nIt was published in Catania in 1858, and is dedicated to Sir Charles\r\nLyell, who ascended the mountain under the guidance of the author. The\r\nlatter also published a _Breve Raggualio della Eruzione dell' Etna, del\r\n21 Agosto 1852_, which contains the most authentic account of this\r\nimportant eruption, accompanied by some graphic sketches made on the\r\nspot. The last contribution of Carlo Gemellaro to the history of Etna,\r\nis fitly entitled _Un Addio al Maggior Vulcano di Europa_. It was\r\npublished in 1866, and with pardonable vanity the author reviews his\r\nwork in connection with the mountain, extending over a period of more\r\nthan forty years. He commences his somewhat florid farewell with the\r\nfollowing apostrophe:--\"O Etna! splendida e perenne manifestazione della\r\nesistenza dei Fuochi sotteranei massimo fra quanti altri monti, dalle\r\ncoste meridionali di Europa, dalle orientali dell' Asia e delle\r\nsettentrionali dell' Africa si specchiano nel Mediterraneo: tremendo pei\r\ntuoi incendii: benigno per la fertilità del vulcanico tuo terreno\r\nridotto a prospera coltivazione ... io, nato appiè del vasto tuo cono,\r\nin quella Città che hai minacciato più d'una volta di sepellire sotto le\r\ntue infocate correnti: allogato, nella mia prima età, in una stanza\r\ndella casa paterna, che signoreggiava in allora più basse abizioni\r\nvicine, ed intiera godeva la veduta della estesa parte meridionalè della\r\ntua mole, io non potera non averti di continuo sotto gli occhi, e non\r\nessere spettatore dei tuoi visibili fenomeni!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1834, M. Elie de Beaumont commenced a minute geological examination\r\nof the mountain. His results were published in 1838, under the title of\r\n_Recherches sur la structure et sur l'origine du Mont Etna_, and they\r\nextend over 225 pages.[11] He re-determined the latitude and longitude\r\nof the mountain, measured the slope of the cone, and the diameter of the\r\ngreat crater, and minutely examined the structure of the rocks at the\r\nbase of the mountain. He also gives a good sectional view, elevations\r\ntaken from each quarter of the compass, and a geological map, which\r\nalthough accurate in its general details, can scarcely be considered\r\nvery satisfactory. A relief map of Etna, a copy of which is in the Royal\r\nSchool of Mines, was afterwards constructed from the flat map, and this\r\nwas, we believe, at the same time, the first geological map, and the\r\nfirst map in relief, which had been made of the mountain. Elie de\r\nBeaumont considers granite as the basis of the mountain, because it is\r\nsometimes ejected from the crater; old basaltic rocks appear in the\r\nIsole dei Ciclopi, and near Paterno, Licodia, and Aderno; _cailloux\r\nroulés_ near Motta; ancient lavas on each side of the Val del Bove;\r\nmodern lavas in every part of the mountain, and calcareous and\r\narenaceous rocks in the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\n[11] Printed in vol. IV. of _Mémoires pour servir a une description\r\nGeologique de la France_. Par M.M. Dufrénoy et Elie de Beaumont.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Abich published some excellent sections of Etna, and an\r\naccurate view of the interior of the crater, in a work entitled _Vues\r\nillustratives de quelques Phénomènes Géologiques prises sur le Vésuve et\r\nl'Etna pendant les années 1833 and 1834_.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the thirteenth volume (1839) of the Berlin _Archiv für\r\nMineralogie, Geognosie, Berghau und Hüttenkunde_, is occupied by an\r\nelaborate memoir on the geology of Sicily[12] by Friedrich Hoffmann,\r\naccompanied by an excellent geological map. A long account of the\r\ngeology of Etna is given, and an enlarged map of the mountain was\r\nafterwards constructed and published in the _Vulkanen Atlas_ of Dr.\r\nLeonhard in 1850.[13]\r\n\r\n[12] Entitled _Geognostiche Beobachtungen Gesammelt auf einer Reise\r\ndurch Italian und Sicilien, in den jahren 1830 bis 1832, von Friedrich\r\nHoffmann_.\r\n\r\n[13] _Vulkanen Atlas zur naturgeschichte der Erde von K. G. Von\r\nLeonhard._ Stuttgardt. 1850.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Baron Sartorius Von Waltershausen commenced a minute survey of\r\nEtna, preparatory to a complete description of the mountain, both\r\ngeological and otherwise. He was assisted by Professor Cavallari of\r\nPalermo, Professor Peters of Hensbourg, and Professor Roos of Mayence.\r\nThe survey occupied six years, (1836-1842), and the results of direct\r\nobservation in the form of maps and drawings, occupied a hundred sheets\r\n160 millimetres (6-1/4 inches) long, by 133 m.m. (5-1/4 inches) broad.\r\nTwenty-nine separate points were made use of in the triangulation; and\r\nthe scale chosen was 1 in 50,000. The results were published in a large\r\nfolio atlas, which appeared in eight parts; the first in 1845 and the\r\nlast in 1861, when the death of Von Waltershausen put an end to the\r\nfurther publication. There are 26 fine coloured maps, and 31 engravings.\r\nThe cost of the atlas is £12. The maps are both geological and\r\ntopographical, and they are accompanied by outline engravings of various\r\ndetails of special interest. The _Atlas des Aetna_ furnishes the most\r\nexhaustive history of any one mountain on the face of the earth, and\r\nSartorius Von Waltershausen will always be the principal authority on\r\nthe subject of Etna.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell visited Etna in 1824, 1857, and again in 1858. He\r\nembodied his researches in a paper presented to the Royal Society in\r\n1859, and in a lengthy chapter in the _Principles of Geology_. His\r\ninvestigations have added much to our knowledge of the formation and\r\ngeological characteristics of the mountain, especially of that part of\r\nit called the Val del Bove.\r\n\r\nLater writers usually quote Von Waltershausen and Lyell, and do not add\r\nmuch original matter. The facts of all subsequent writers are taken more\r\nor less directly from these authors. The latest addition to the\r\nliterature of the mountain, is the _Wanderungen am Aetna_ of Dr.\r\nBaltzer, in the journal of the Swiss Alpine Club for 1874.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] Jahrbuch des Schweizer Alpen Club. Neunter Jahrgang, 1873-1874.\r\nBern 1874.\r\n\r\nA fine map of Sicily, on the unusually large scale of 1 in 50,000, or\r\n1·266 inch to a mile, was constructed by the Stato Maggiore of the\r\nItalian government, between 1864 and 1868. The portion relating to Etna,\r\nand its immediate surroundings occupies four sheets. All the small roads\r\nand rivulets are introduced; the minor cones and monticules are placed\r\nin their proper positions, and the elevation of the ground is given at\r\nshort intervals of space over the entire map. An examination of this map\r\nshows us that distances, areas, and heights, have been repeatedly\r\nmisstated, the minor cones misplaced, and the trend of the coast line\r\nmisrepresented. For example, if we draw a line due north and south\r\nthrough Catania, and a second line from the Capo di Taormina, (the\r\nnorth-eastern limit of the base of Etna), until it meets the first line\r\nat Catania, the lines, will be found to enclose an angle of 26°. If we\r\nadopt the same plan with Gemellaro's map, the included angle is found to\r\nbe 53°, and in the case of the maps of Ferrara and Recupero more than\r\n60°. Again, it has been stated on good authority, that the lava of 396\r\nB.C. which enters the sea at Capo di Schiso flowed for a distance of\r\nnearly 30 miles; the map shows us that its true course was less than 16\r\nmiles. Lyell in 1858 gives a section of the mountain from West 20° N.,\r\nto East 20° S., but a comparison with the new map proves that the\r\nsection is really taken from West 35° N. to East 35° S., an error which\r\nat a radius of ten miles from the crater would amount to a difference of\r\nnearly three miles.\r\n\r\nThe mantle of Carlo Gemellaro appears to have fallen upon Cav. Orazio\r\nSilvestri, Professor of Chemistry in the University of Catania. He has\r\ndevoted himself with unwearying vigour to the study of the mountain, and\r\nhis memoirs have done much to elucidate its past and present history.\r\nHis most recent work of importance on the subject is entitled _I\r\nFenomeni Vulcanici presentati dall'Etna nel 1863-64-65-66_. It was\r\npublished in Catania in 1867, and contains an account of some very\r\nelaborate chemico-geological researches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n    Height.--Radius of Vision from the summit.--Boundaries.--Area.--\r\n    Population.--General aspect of Etna.--The Val del Bove.--Minor\r\n    Cones.--Caverns.--Position and extent of the three Regions.--Regione\r\n    Coltivata.--Regione Selvosa.--Regione Deserta.--Botanical Regions.--\r\n    Divisions of Rafinesque-Schmaltz, and of Presl.--Animal life in the\r\n    upper Regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have discussed the history of Mount Etna;\r\nthe references to its phenomena afforded by writers of various periods;\r\nand the present state of the literature of the subject. We have now to\r\nconsider the general aspect and physical features of the mountain,\r\ntogether with the divisions of its surface into distinct regions.\r\n\r\nThe height of Etna has been often determined. The earlier writers had\r\nvery extravagant notions on the subject, and three miles has sometimes\r\nbeen assigned to it. Brydone, Saussure, Shuckburgh, Irvine, and others,\r\nobtained approximations to the real height; it must be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that the cone of a volcano is liable to variations in height at\r\ndifferent periods, and a diminution of as much as 300 feet occurred\r\nduring one of the eruptions of Etna, owing to the falling in of the\r\nupper portion of the crater. During the last sixty years, however, the\r\nheight of the mountain has been practically constant. In 1815 Captain\r\nSmyth determined it to be 10,874 feet. In 1824 Sir John Herschel, who\r\nwas unacquainted with Smyth's results, estimated it at 10,872-1/2 feet.\r\nThe new map of the Stato Maggiore gives 3312·61 metres = 10867·94 feet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Canon Recupero devoted two chapters of his quarto volume to a\r\ndiscussion of the height of Etna, no such exact observations had been\r\nmade, consequently he compared, and critically examined, the various\r\ndeterminations which then existed. The almost perfect concordance of the\r\nresults given by Smyth, Herschel, and the Stato Maggiore, render it\r\nunnecessary for us to further discuss a subject about which there can\r\nnow be no difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jukes says, \"If we were to put Snowdon, the highest mountain\r\nin Wales, on the top of Ben Nevis, the highest in Scotland, and\r\nCarrantuohill, the highest in Ireland, on the summit of both, we should\r\nmake a mountain but a very little higher than Etna, and we should\r\nrequire to heap up a great number of other mountains round the flanks of\r\nour new one in order to build a gentle sloping pile which should equal\r\nEtna in bulk.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent of radius of vision from the summit of Etna is very variously\r\nstated. The exaggerated notions of the earlier writers, that the coast\r\nof Africa and of Greece are sometimes visible, may be at once set aside.\r\nLord Ormonde's statement that he saw the Gulf of Taranta, and the\r\nmountains of Terra di Lecce beyond it--a distance of 245 miles--must be\r\nreceived with caution. It is, however, a fact that Malta, 130 miles\r\ndistant, is often visible; and Captain Smyth asserts that a considerable\r\nportion of the upper part of the mountain may sometimes be seen, and\r\nthat he once saw more than half of it, from Malta, although that island\r\nis usually surrounded by a sea-horizon. It is stated on good authority\r\nthat Monte S. Giuliano above Trapani, and the OEgadean Isles, 160 miles\r\ndistant, are sometimes seen. Other writers give 128 miles as the limit.\r\nThe fact is, that atmospheric refraction varies so much with different\r\nconditions of the atmosphere that it is almost impossible to give any\r\nexact statement. The more so when we remember that there may be many\r\nlayers of atmosphere of different density between the observer and the\r\nhorizon. Distant objects seem to be just under one's feet when seen from\r\nthe summit of the mountain. Smyth gives the radius of vision as 150·7\r\nmiles: and this we are inclined to adopt as the nearest approach to the\r\ntruth, because Smyth was an accurate observer, and he made careful\r\ncorrections both for error of instruments and for refraction. This\r\nradius gives an horizon of 946·4 miles of circumference, and an\r\nincluded area of 39,900 square miles--larger than the area of Ireland.\r\nIf a circle be traced with the crater of Etna as a centre, and a radius\r\nof 150·7 miles, it will be found to take in the whole of Sicily and\r\nMalta, to cut the western coast of Italy at Scalca in Calabria, leaving\r\nthe south-east coast near Cape Rizzuto. Such a circle will include the\r\nwhole of Ireland, or if we take Derby as the centre, its circumference\r\nwill touch the sea beyond Yarmouth on the East, the Isle of Wight on the\r\nSouth, the Irish Channel on the West, and it will pass beyond Carlisle\r\nand Newcastle-on-Tyne on the North.\r\n\r\nThe road which surrounds the mountain is carried along its lower slopes,\r\nand is 87 miles in length. It passes through the towns of Paterno,\r\nAderno, Bronte, Randazzo, Linguaglossa, Giarre, and Aci Reale. It is\r\nconsidered by some writers to define the base of the mountain, which is\r\nhence most erroneously said to have a circumference of 87 miles; but the\r\nroad frequently passes over high beds of lava, and winds considerably.\r\nIt is about 10 miles from the crater on the North, East, and West sides,\r\nincreasing to 15-1/2 miles at Paterno, (S.W.). The elevation on the North\r\nand West flanks of the mountain is nearly 2,500 feet, while on the South\r\nit falls to 1,500 feet, and on the East to within 50 feet of the level\r\nof the sea. It is quite clear that it cannot be asserted with any\r\ndegree of accuracy to define the base of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sections of Etna]\r\n\r\nThe \"natural boundaries\" of Etna are the rivers Alcantara and Simeto on\r\nthe North, West, and South, and the sea on the East to the extent of 23\r\nmiles of coast, along which lava streams have been traced, sometimes\r\nforming headlands several hundred feet in height. The base of the\r\nmountain, as defined by these natural boundaries, is said to have a\r\ncircumference of \"at least 120 miles,\" an examination of the new map,\r\nhowever, proves that this is over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIf we take the sea as the eastern boundary, the river Alcantara,\r\n(immediately beyond which Monte di Mojo, the most northerly minor cone\r\nof Etna is situated), as the northern boundary, and the river Simeto as\r\nthe boundary on the west and south, we obtain a circumference of 91\r\nmiles for the base of Etna. In this estimate the small sinuosities of\r\nthe river have been neglected, and the southern circuit has been\r\ncompleted by drawing a line from near Paterno to Catania, because the\r\nSimeto runs for the last few miles of its course through the plain of\r\nCatania, quite beyond the most southerly stream of lava. The Simeto\r\n(anciently _Simæthus_) is called the Giaretta along the last three miles\r\nof its course, after its junction with the Gurna Longa.\r\n\r\nThe area of the region enclosed by these boundaries is approximately 480\r\nsquare miles. Reclus gives the area of the mountain as 1,200 square\r\nkilometres--461 square miles. (_Nouvelle Geographie Universelle_, 1875.)\r\nThe last edition of a standard Gazetteer states it as \"849 square\r\nmiles;\" but this estimate is altogether absurd. This would require a\r\ncircle having a radius of between sixteen and seventeen miles. If a\r\ncircle be drawn with a radius of sixteen miles from the crater, it will\r\npass out to sea to a distance of 4-1/2 miles on the East, while on the\r\nWest and North it will pass through limestone and sandstone formations\r\nfar beyond the Alcantara and the Simeto, and beyond the limit of the\r\nlava streams.\r\n\r\nThere are two cities, Catania and Aci Reale, and sixty-two towns or\r\nvillages on Mount Etna. It is far more thickly populated than any other\r\npart of Sicily or Italy, for while the population of the former is 228\r\nper square mile, and of the latter 233, the population of the habitable\r\nzone of Etna amounts to 1,424 per square mile. More than 300,000 persons\r\nlive on the slopes of the mountain. Thus with an area rather larger than\r\nthat of Bedfordshire (462 square miles) the mountain has more than\r\ndouble the population; and with an area equal to about one-third that of\r\nWiltshire, the population of the mountain is greater by nearly 50,000\r\ninhabitants. We have stated above that the area of Etna is 480 square\r\nmiles, but it must be borne in mind that the habitable zone only\r\ncommences at a distance of about 9-1/4 miles from the crater. A circle,\r\nhaving a radius of 9-1/4 miles, encloses an area of 269 square miles;\r\nand 480 minus 269 leaves 211 square miles as the approximate area of the\r\nhabitable zone. Only a few insignificant villages on the East side are\r\nnearer to the crater than 9-1/4 miles. Taking the inhabitants as\r\n300,000, we find, by dividing this number by 211, (the area of the\r\nhabitable zone), that the population amounts to 1,424 per square mile.\r\nEven Lancashire, the most populous county in Great Britain, (of course\r\nexcepting Middlesex), and the possessor of two cities, which alone\r\nfurnish more than a million inhabitants, has a population of only 1,479\r\nto the square mile.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the closeness of the towns and villages may be found by\r\nexamining the south-east corner of the map. If we draw a line from Aci\r\nReale to Nicolosi, and from Nicolosi to Catania, we enclose a nearly\r\nequilateral triangle, having the coast line between Aci Reale and\r\nCatania as its third side.\r\n\r\nStarting from Aci Reale with 24,151 inhabitants, and moving westwards to\r\nNicolosi, we come in succession to Aci S. Lucia, Aci Catena, Aci S.\r\nAntonio, Via Grande, Tre Castagni, Pedara, Nicolosi, completing the\r\nfirst side of the triangle; then turning to the south-east and following\r\nthe Catania road, we pass Torre di Grifo, Mascalucia, Gravina, and reach\r\nCatania with 85,055 inhabitants; while on the line of coast between\r\nCatania and Aci Reale we have Ognina, Aci Castello, and Trezza. Within\r\nthe triangle we find Aci Patane, Aci S. Filippo, Valverde, Bonacorsi, S.\r\nGregorio, Tremestieri, Piano, S. Agata, Trappeto, and S. Giovanni la\r\nPunta: in all twenty-five, two of which are cities, several of the\r\nothers towns of about 3,000 inhabitants, and the rest villages. These\r\nare all included within an area of less than thirty square miles, which\r\nconstitutes the most populous portion of the habitable zone of Etna.\r\n\r\nThat the population is rapidly increasing is well shown by a comparison\r\nof the number of inhabitants of some of the more important towns in 1824\r\nand in 1876.[15]\r\n\r\n                     _1824_  _1876_\r\n\r\n    Catania          45,081  85,055\r\n    Aci Reale        14,094  24,151\r\n    Giarre           13,705  17,965\r\n    Paternò           9,808  16,512\r\n    Aderno            6,623  15,657\r\n    Bronte            9,153  15,081\r\n    Biancavilla       5,870  13,261\r\n    Linguaglossa      2,415   9,120\r\n    Randazzo          4,700   8,378\r\n    Piedimonte Etnea  1,404   4,924\r\n    Zaffarana Etnea     700   3,884\r\n    Pedara            2,068   3,181\r\n    Trecastagni       2,406   3,061\r\n\r\n[15] I am indebted for these figures to Mr. George Dennis, H.M. Consul\r\nGeneral for Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of Etna is that of a pretty regular cone, covered\r\nwith vegetation, except near the summit. The regularity is broken on the\r\nEast side by a slightly oval valley, four or five miles in diameter,\r\ncalled the _Val del Bove_, or in the language of the district Val del\r\n_Bue_. This commences about two miles from the summit, and is bounded on\r\nthree sides by nearly vertical precipices from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in\r\nheight. The bottom of the valley is covered with lavas of various date,\r\nand several minor craters have from time to time been upraised from it.\r\nMany eruptions have commenced in the immediate neighbourhood of the Val\r\ndel Bove, and Lyell believes that there formerly existed a centre of\r\npermanent eruption in the valley. The Val del Bove is altogether\r\nsterile; but the mountain at the same level is, on other sides, clothed\r\nwith trees. The vast mass of the mountain is realised by the fact that,\r\nafter twelve miles of the ascent from Catania, the summit looks as far\r\noff as it did at starting. Moreover, Mount Vesuvius might be almost\r\nhidden away in the Val del Bove.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of Etna is the large number of minor craters which\r\nare scattered over its sides. They look small in comparison with the\r\ngreat mass of the mountain, but in reality some of them are of large\r\ndimensions. Monte Minardo, near Bronte, the largest of these minor\r\ncones, is still 750 feet high, although its base has been raised by\r\nmodern lava-streams which have flowed around it. There are 80 of the\r\nmore conspicuous of these minor cones, but Von Waltershausen has mapped\r\nno less than 200 within a ten mile radius from the great crater, while\r\nneglecting many monticules of ashes. As to the statement made by Reclus\r\nto the effect that there are 700 minor cones, and by Jukes, that the\r\nnumber is 600, it is to be supposed that they include not only the most\r\ninsignificant monticules and heaps of cinders, but also the _bocche_ and\r\n_boccarelle_ from which at any time lava or fire has issued. If these be\r\nincluded, no doubt these numbers are not exaggerations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grotto delle Palombe]\r\n\r\nThe only important minor cone which has been produced during the\r\nhistorical period, is the double mountain known as Monti Rossi, from the\r\nred colour of the cinders which compose it. This was raised from the\r\nplain of Nicolosi during the eruption of 1669; it is 450 feet in height,\r\nand two miles in circumference at the base. In a line between the Monti\r\nRossi and the great crater, thirty-three minor cones may be counted.\r\nHamilton counted forty-four, looking down from the summit towards\r\nCatania, and Captain Smyth was able to discern fifty at once from an\r\nelevated position on the mountain. Many of these parasitic cones are\r\ncovered with vegetation, as the names Monte Faggi, Monte Ilice, Monte\r\nZappini, indicate. The names have not been happily chosen; thus there\r\nare several cones in different parts of the mountain called by the same\r\nname--Monte Arso, Monte Nero, Monte Rosso, Monte Frumento, are the most\r\ncommon of the duplicates. Moreover, the names have from time to time\r\nbeen altered, and it thus sometimes becomes difficult to trace a cone\r\nwhich has been alluded to under a former name, or by an author who wrote\r\nbefore the name was changed. In addition to the minor cones from which\r\nlava once proceeded, there are numerous smaller vents for the\r\nsubterranean fires called _Bocche_, or if very small, _Boccarelle_, _del\r\nFuoco_. In the eruption of 1669, thirteen mouths opened in the course of\r\na few days; and in the eruption of 1809, twenty new mouths opened one\r\nafter the other in a line about six miles long. Two new craters were\r\nformed in the Val del Bove in 1852, and seven craters in 1865. The\r\noutbursts of lava from lateral cones are no doubt due to the fact that\r\nthe pressure of lava in the great crater, which is nearly 1000 feet in\r\ndepth, becomes so great that the lava is forced out at some lower point\r\nof less resistance. The most northerly of the minor cones is Monte di\r\nMojo, from whence issued the lava of 396 B.C., it is 11-1/2 miles from\r\nthe crater; the most southerly cone is Monte Ste Sofia, 16 miles from\r\nthe crater. Nearly all the minor cones are within 10 miles of the\r\ncrater, and the majority are collected between south-east, and west,\r\nthat is, in an angular space of 135°, starting midway between east and\r\nsouth, (45° south of due east) to due west, (90° west of due south).\r\nLyell speaks of the minor cones \"as the most grand and original feature\r\nin the physiognomy of Etna.\"\r\n\r\nA number of caverns are met with in various parts of Etna; Boccacio\r\nspeaks of the Cavern of Thalia, and several early writers allude to the\r\nGrotto delle Palombe near Nicolosi. The latter is situated in front of\r\nMonte Fusara, and the entrance to it is evidently the crater of an\r\nextinct monticule. It descends for 78 feet, and at the bottom a cavern\r\nis entered by a long shaft; this leads to a second cavern, which\r\nabruptly descends, and appears to be continued into the heart of the\r\nneighbouring Monti Rossi. Brydone says that people have lost their\r\nsenses in these caverns, \"imagining that they saw devils, and the\r\nspirits of the damned; for it is still very generally believed that Etna\r\nis the mouth of Hell.\" Many of the caverns near the upper part of the\r\nmountain are used for storing snow, and sometimes as places of shelter\r\nfor shepherds. We have already seen to what extent Lucretius attributed\r\nthe eruptions to air pent up within the interior caverns of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the mountain has been divided into three zones or\r\nregions--the _Piedimontana_ or _Coltivata_; the _Selvosa_ or _Nemorosa_;\r\nand the _Deserta_ or _Discoperta_. Sometimes the name of _Regione del\r\nFuoco_ is given to the central cone and crater. As regards temperature,\r\nthe zones correspond more or less to the Torrid, Temperate, and Frigid.\r\nThe lowest of these, the _Cultivated Region_, yields in abundance all\r\nthe ordinary Sicilian products. The soil, which consists of decomposed\r\nlava, is extremely fertile, although of course large tracts of land are\r\ncovered by recent lavas, or by those which decompose slowly. In this\r\nregion the vine flourishes, and abundance of corn, olives, pistachio\r\nnuts, oranges, lemons, figs, and other fruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of this region varies; it terminates at an approximate\r\nheight of 2000 feet. A circle drawn with a radius of 10 miles from the\r\ncrater, roughly defines the limit. The elevation of this on the north is\r\n2,310 feet near Randazzo; on the south, 2,145 feet near Nicolosi; on the\r\neast, 600 feet near Mascali; and on the west, 1,145 feet near Bronte.\r\nThe breadth of this cultivated zone is about 2 miles on the north, east,\r\nand west, and 9 or 10 on the south, if we take for the base of the\r\nmountain the limits proposed above.\r\n\r\nThe _Woody Region_ commences where the cultivated region ends, and\r\nextends as a belt of varying width to an approximate height of 6,300\r\nfeet. It is terminated above by a circle having a radius of nearly 1-1/2\r\nmiles from the crater. There are fourteen separate forests in this\r\nregion: some abounding with the oak, beech, pine, and poplar, others\r\nwith the chestnut, ilex, and cork tree.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated _Castagno di Cento Cavalli_, one of the largest and\r\noldest trees in the world, is in the Forest of Carpinetto, on the East\r\nside of the mountain, five miles above Giarre. This tree has the\r\nappearance of five separate trunks united into one, but Ferrara declares\r\nthat by digging a very short distance below the surface he found one\r\nsingle stem. The public road now passes through the much-decayed trunk.\r\nCaptain Smyth measured the circumference a few feet from the ground, and\r\nfound it to be 163 feet, which would give it a diameter of more than 50\r\nfeet. The tree derives its name from the story that one of the Queens of\r\nArragon took shelter in its trunk with a suite of 100 horsemen. Near\r\nthis patriarch are several large chestnuts, which, without a shadow of\r\ndoubt, are single trees; one of these is 18 feet in diameter, and a\r\nsecond 15 feet, while the _Castagno della Galea_, higher up on the\r\nmountain, is 25 feet in diameter, and probably more than 1000 years old.\r\nThe breadth of the Regione Selvosa varies considerably, as may be seen\r\nby reference to the accompanying map; in the direction of the Val del\r\nBove it is very narrow, while elsewhere it frequently has a breadth of\r\nfrom 6 to 8 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Desert Region is embraced between the limit of 6,300 feet and the\r\nsummit. It occupies about 10 square miles, and consists of a dreary\r\nwaste of black sand, scoriæ, ashes, and masses of ejected lava. In\r\nwinter it remains permanently covered with snow, and even in the height\r\nof summer snow may be found in certain rifts.\r\n\r\nBotanists have divided the surface of Etna into seven regions. The first\r\nextends from the level of the sea to 100 feet above it, and in it\r\nflourishes the palm, banana, Indian fig or prickly pear, sugar-cane,\r\nmimosa, and acacia. It must be remembered, however, that it is only on\r\nthe east side of the mountain that the level within the base sinks to\r\n100 feet above the sea; and, moreover, that the palm, banana, and\r\nsugar-cane, are comparative rarities in this part of Sicily. Prickly\r\npears and vines are the most abundant products of the lower slopes of\r\nthe eastern side of Etna. The second, or hilly region, reaches from 100\r\nto 2000 feet above the sea, and therefore constitutes, with the\r\npreceding, the _Regione Coltivata_ of our former division. In it are\r\nfound cotton, maize, orange, lemon, shaddock, and the ordinary Sicilian\r\nproduce. The culture of the vine ceases near its upward limit. The\r\nthird, or woody region, reaches from 2000 to 4000 feet, and the\r\nprincipal trees within it are the cork, oak, maple, and chestnut. The\r\nfourth region extends from 4000 to 6000 feet, and contains the beech,\r\nScotch fir, birch, dock, plaintain, and sandworth. The fifth, or\r\nsub-Alpine region, extending from 6000 to 7000 feet, contains the\r\nbarberry, soapwort, toad-flax, and juniper. In the sixth region, 7,500\r\nto 9000 feet, are found soapwort, sorrel, and groundsel; while the last\r\nnarrow zone, 9000 to 9,200 feet, contains a few lichens, the commonest\r\nof which is the _Stereocaulon Paschale_. The flora of Etna comprises 477\r\nspecies, only 40 of which are found between 7000 feet and the summit,\r\nwhile in the last 2000 feet only five phanerogamous species are found,\r\nviz., Anthemis Etnensis, Senecio Etnensis, Robertsia taraxacoides,\r\n(which are peculiar to Etna), Tanacetum vulgare, and Astragulus Siculus.\r\nCommon ferns, such as the _pteris aquilina_, are found in abundance\r\nbeneath the trees in the Regione Selvosa.\r\n\r\nThis division has been advocated by Presl in his _Flora Sicula_.[16] He\r\nnames the different regions beginning from below: _Regio Subtropica_,\r\n_Regio Collina_, _Regio Sylvatica inferior_, _Regio fagi Sylvestris_.\r\nThese four are common to all Sicily. The three remaining regions, _Regio\r\nSubalpina_, _Regio Alpina_, and _Regio Lichenum_, together extending\r\nfrom 6000 to 9,200 feet, belong to Etna alone.\r\n\r\n[16] \"Flora sicula: exhibens Plantas vasculosas in Sicilia aut sponte\r\ncrescentes aut frequentissime cultas, secundum systema naturale\r\ndigestas.\" Auctore G. B. Presl. Pragæ, 1824.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the first volume of Recupero's _Storia Naturale et\r\nGenerale dell' Etna_ we find a somewhat different botanical division\r\nproposed by Signor Rafinesque-Schmaltz.[17] He makes his divisions in\r\nthe following manner:--\r\n\r\n    1. Florula Piedemontana.\r\n    2. Florula Nemorosa.\r\n    3. Florula excelsa o della Regione Discoperta.\r\n    4. Florula Arenosa o della Regione delle Scorie.\r\n\r\n[17] Chloris Aetnensis: o le quattro Florule dell' Etna, opusculo del\r\nSig. C. S. Rafinesque-Schmaltz, Palermo. Dicembre, 1813.\r\n\r\nIn the latter region, (to which he assigns no limit as to height), he\r\nfound Potentilla Argentea, Rumex Scutatus, Tanacetum Vulgare, Anthemis\r\nMontana, Jacobæa Chrysanthemifolia, Seriola Uniflora, and Phalaris\r\nAlpina.\r\n\r\nAs regards the animal life on Etna, of course it is the same as that of\r\nthe eastern sea-board of Sicily, except in the higher regions, where it\r\nbecomes more sparse. The only living creatures in the upper regions are\r\nants, a little lower down Spallanzani found a few partridges, jays,\r\nthrushes, ravens, and kites.\r\n\r\nBrydone says of the three regions: \"Besides the corn, the wine, the oil,\r\nthe silk, the spice, and delicious fruits of its lower region; the\r\nbeautiful forests, the flocks, the game, the tar, the cork, the honey of\r\nits second; the snow and ice of its third; it affords from its caverns a\r\nvariety of minerals and other productions--cinnabar, mercury, sulphur,\r\nalum, nitre, and vitriol; so that this wonderful mountain at the same\r\ntime produces every necessary, and every luxury of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n    The most suitable time for ascending Etna.--The ascent commenced.--\r\n    Nicolosi.--Etna mules.--Night journey through the upper Regions of\r\n    the mountain.--Brilliancy of the Stars.--Proposed Observatory on\r\n    Etna.--The Casa Inglesi.--Summit of the Great Crater.--Sunrise from\r\n    the summit.--The Crater.--Descent from the Mountain.--Effects of\r\n    Refraction.--Fatigue of the Ascent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ascent of Mount Etna has been described many times during the last\r\neighteen centuries, from Strabo in the second century to Dr. Baltzer in\r\n1875. One of the most interesting accounts is certainly that of Brydone,\r\nand in this century perhaps that of Mr. Gladstone. Of course the\r\ninterest of the expedition is greatly increased if it can be combined\r\nwith that spice of danger which is afforded by the fact of the mountain\r\nbeing in a state of eruption at the time.\r\n\r\nThe best period for making the ascent is between May and September,\r\nafter the melting of the winter snows, and before the autumnal rains. In\r\nwinter snow frequently extends from the summit downwards for nine or\r\nten miles; the paths are obliterated, and the guides refuse to accompany\r\ntravellers. Even so late in the spring as May 29th Brydone had to\r\ntraverse seven miles of snow before reaching the summit. Moreover,\r\nviolent storms often rage in the upper regions of the mountain, and the\r\nwind acquires a force which it is difficult to withstand, and is at the\r\nsame time piercingly cold. Sir William Hamilton, in relating his ascent\r\non the night of June 26th, 1769, remarks that, if they had not kindled a\r\nfire at the halting place, and put on much warm clothing, they would\r\n\"surely have perished with the cold.\" At the same time the wind was so\r\nviolent that they had several times to throw themselves on their faces\r\nto avoid being overthrown. Yet the guides said that the wind was not\r\nunusually violent. Some writers, well used to Alpine climbing, have\r\nasserted that the cold on Etna was more severe than anything they have\r\never experienced in the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this memoir made the ascent of the mountain in August\r\n1877, accompanied by a courier and a guide. We took with us two mules;\r\nsome thick rugs; provisions consisting of bread, meat, wine, coffee, and\r\nbrandy; wooden staves for making the ascent of the cone; a geological\r\nhammer; a bag for specimens; and a few other requisites. It has to be\r\nremembered that absolutely nothing is to be met with at the Casa\r\nInglesi, where the halt is made for the night; even firewood has to be\r\ntaken, a fire being most necessary in those elevated regions even during\r\na midsummer's night. For some time previous to our ascent the weather\r\nhad been uniformly bright and fine, and there had been no rain for more\r\nthan three months. The mean temperature in the shade at Catania, and\r\ngenerally along the eastern sea-base of the mountain, was 82° F.\r\n\r\nAs we desired to see the sunrise from the summit of the mountain, we\r\ndetermined to ascend during the cool of the evening, resting for an hour\r\nor two before sunrise at the Casa Inglesi at the foot of the cone.\r\nAccordingly we left Catania soon after midday, and drove to Nicolosi,\r\ntwelve miles distant, and 2,288 feet above the sea. The road for some\r\ndistance passed through a very fertile district; on either side there\r\nwere corn fields and vineyards, and gardens of orange and lemon trees,\r\nfigs and almonds, growing luxuriantly in the decomposed lava. About half\r\nway between Catania and Nicolosi stands the village of Gravina, and a\r\nmile beyond it Mascalucia, a small town containing nearly 4000\r\ninhabitants. Near this is the ruined church of St. Antonio, founded in\r\n1300. Nine miles from Catania the village of Torre di Grifo is passed,\r\nand the road then enters a nearly barren district covered with the lava\r\nand scoriæ of 1527. The only prominent form of vegetation is a peculiar\r\ntall broom--_Genista Etnensis_--which here flourishes. We are now\r\nentering the region of minor cones; the vineclad cone of Monpilieri is\r\nvisible on the left, and just above it Monti Rossi, 3,110 feet above the\r\nsea; to the right of the latter we see Monte San Nicola, Serrapizzuta,\r\nand Monte Arso. We reach Nicolosi at half-past four; for although the\r\ndistance is short, the road is very rugged and steep.\r\n\r\nNicolosi has a population of less than 3,000; it consists of a long\r\nstreet, bordered by one-storied cottages of lava. In the church the\r\npriests were preparing for a _festa_ in honour of S. Anthony of Padua.\r\nThey politely took us into the sacristy, and exhibited with much pride\r\nsome graven images of rather coarse workmanship, which were covered with\r\ngilding and bright coloured paint. Near Nicolosi stands the convent of\r\nS. Nicola dell' Arena, once inhabited by Benedictine monks, who however\r\nwere compelled to abandon it in consequence of the destruction produced\r\nby successive shocks of earthquake. Nicolosi itself has been more than\r\nonce shaken to the ground. We dined pretty comfortably, thanks to the\r\ncourier who acted as cook, in the one public room of the one primitive\r\ninn of the town; starting for the Casa Inglesi at 6 o'clock. The good\r\npeople of the inn surrounded us at our departure and with much warmth\r\nwished us a safe and successful journey.\r\n\r\nFor a short distance above Nicolosi, stunted vines are seen growing in\r\nblack cinders, but these soon give place to a large tract covered with\r\nlava and ashes, with here and there patches of broom. There was no\r\nvisible path, but the mules seemed to know the way perfectly, and they\r\ncontinued to ascend with the same easy even pace without any guidance,\r\neven after the sun had disappeared behind the western flank of the\r\nmountain. In fact, you trust yourself absolutely to your mule, which\r\npicks his way over the roughest ground, and rarely stumbles or changes\r\nhis even step. I found it quite easy to write notes while ascending, and\r\neven to use a pocket spectroscope at the time of the setting sun.\r\nSubsequently we saw a man extended at full length, and fast asleep upon\r\na mule, which was leisurely plodding along the highway. The same\r\nconfidence must not however be extended to the donkeys of Etna, as I\r\nfound to my cost a few days later at Taormina. Here the only animal to\r\nbe procured to carry me down to the sea-shore, 800 feet below, was a\r\ndonkey. It was during the hottest part of the day, and it was necessary\r\nto carry an umbrella in one hand, and comfortable to wear a kind of\r\nturban of many folds of thin muslin round one's cap. The donkey after\r\ncarefully selecting the roughest and most precipitous part of the road,\r\npromptly fell down, leaving me extended at full length on the road, with\r\nthe open umbrella a few yards off. At the same time the turban came\r\nunfolded, and stretched itself for many a foot upon the ground.\r\nAltogether it was a most comical sight, and it reminded me forcibly, and\r\nat the instant, of a picture which I once saw over the altar of a\r\nchurch in Pisa, and which represented S. Thomas Aquinas discomfiting\r\nPlato, Aristotle, and Averröes. The latter was completely overthrown,\r\nand in the most literal sense, for he was grovelling in the dust at the\r\nfeet of S. Thomas, while his disarranged turban had fallen from him.\r\n\r\nThe district of lava and ashes above Nicolosi is succeeded by forests of\r\nsmall trees, and we are now fairly within the _Regione Selvosa_. At\r\nhalf-past 8 o'clock the temperature was 66°, at Nicolosi at 4 o'clock it\r\nwas 80°. About 9 o'clock we arrived at the Casa del Bosco, (4,216 feet),\r\na small house in which several men in charge of the forest live. Here we\r\nrested till 10 o'clock, and then after I had put on a great-coat and a\r\nsecond waistcoat, we started for the higher regions. At this time the\r\nair was extraordinarily still, the flame of a candle placed near the\r\nopen door of the house did not flicker. The ascent from this point\r\ncarried us through forests of pollard oaks, in which it was quite\r\nimpossible to see either a path or any obstacles which might lie in\r\none's way. The guide carried a lantern, and the mules seemed well\r\naccustomed to the route. At about 6,300 feet we entered the _Regione\r\nDeserta_, a lifeless waste of black sand, ashes, and lava; the ascent\r\nbecame more steep, and the air was bitterly cold. There was no moon, but\r\nthe stars shone with an extraordinary brilliancy, and sparkled like\r\nparticles of white-hot steel. I had never before seen the heavens\r\nstudded with such myriads of stars. The milky-way shone like a path of\r\nfire, and meteors flashed across the sky in such numbers that I soon\r\ngave up any attempt to count them. The vault of heaven seemed to be much\r\nnearer than when seen from the earth, and more flat, as if only a short\r\ndistance above our heads, and some of the brighter stars appeared to be\r\nhanging down from the sky. Brydone, in speaking of his impressions under\r\nsimilar circumstances says:\r\n\r\n\"The sky was clear, and the immense vault of heaven appeared in awful\r\nmajesty and splendour. We found ourselves more struck with veneration\r\nthan below, and at first were at a loss to know the cause, till we\r\nobserved with astonishment that the number of the stars seemed to be\r\ninfinitely increased, and the light of each of them appeared brighter\r\nthan usual. The whiteness of the milky-way was like a pure flame that\r\nshot across the heavens, and with the naked eye we could observe\r\nclusters of stars that were invisible in the regions below. We did not\r\nat first attend to the cause, nor recollect that we had now passed\r\nthrough ten or twelve thousand feet of gross vapour, that blunts and\r\nconfuses every ray before it reaches the surface of the earth. We were\r\namazed at the distinctness of vision, and exclaimed together, 'What a\r\nglorious situation for an observatory! had Empedocles had the eyes of\r\nGalileo, what discoveries must he not have made!' We regretted that\r\nJupiter was not visible, as I am persuaded we might have discovered some\r\nof his satellites with the naked eye, or at least with a small glass\r\nwhich I had in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nBrydone wrote a hundred years ago, but his idea of erecting an\r\nobservatory on Mount Etna was only revived last year, when Prof.\r\nTacchini the Astronomer Royal at Palermo, communicated a paper to the\r\nAccademia Gioenia, entitled \"_Della Convenienza ed utilita di erigere\r\nsull' Etna una Stazione Astronomico-Meteorologico_.\" Tacchini mentions\r\nthe extraordinary blueness of the sky as seen from Etna, and the\r\nappearance of the sun, which is \"whiter and more tranquil\" than when\r\nseen from below. Moreover, the spectroscopic lines are defined with\r\nwonderful distinctness. In the evening at 10 o'clock, Sirius appeared to\r\nrival Venus, the peculiarities of the ring of Saturn were seen far\r\nbetter than at Palermo; and Venus emitted a light sufficiently powerful\r\nto cast shadows; it also scintillated. When the chromosphere of the sun\r\nwas examined the next morning by the spectroscope, the inversion of the\r\nmagnesium line, and of the line 1474 was immediately apparent, although\r\nit was impossible to obtain this effect at Palermo. Tacchini proposes\r\nthat an observatory should be established at the Casa Inglesi, in\r\nconnection with the University of Catania, and that it be provided with\r\na good six-inch refracting telescope, and with meteorological\r\ninstruments. In this observatory, constant observations should be made\r\nfrom the beginning of June to the end of September, and the telescope\r\nshould then be transported to Catania, where a duplicate mounting might\r\nbe provided for it, and observations continued for the rest of the year.\r\nThere seems to be every probability that this scheme will be carried out\r\nin the course of next year.\r\n\r\nDuring this digression we have been toiling along the slopes of the\r\n_Regione Deserta_ and looking at the sky; at length we reach the _Piano\r\ndel Lago_ or Plain of the Lake, so called because a lake produced by the\r\nmelting of the snows existed here till 1607, when it was filled up by\r\nlava. The air is now excessively cold, and a sharp wind is blowing.\r\nProgress is very slow, the soil consists of loose ashes, and the mules\r\nfrequently stop; the guide assures us that the Casa Inglesi is quite\r\nnear, but the stoppages become so frequent that it seems a long way off;\r\nat length we dismount, and drag the mules after us, and after a toilsome\r\nwalk the small lava-built house, called the Casa Inglesi, is reached\r\n(1.30 a.m., temperature 40° F.) It stands at a height of 9,652 feet\r\nabove the sea, near the base of the cone of the great crater, and it\r\ntakes its name from the fact that it was erected by the English officers\r\nstationed in Sicily in 1811. It has suffered severely from time to time\r\nfrom the pressure of snow and from earthquakes, but it was thoroughly\r\nrepaired in 1862, on the occasion of the visit of Prince Humbert, and is\r\nnow in tolerable preservation. It consists of three rooms, containing a\r\nfew deal chairs, a table, and several shelves like the berths of ships\r\nfurnished with plain straw mattresses; there is also a rough fireplace.\r\nWe had no sooner reached this house, very weary and so cold that we\r\ncould scarcely move, than it was discovered that the courier had omitted\r\nto get the key from Nicolosi, and there seemed a prospect of spending\r\nthe hours till dawn in the open air. Fortunately we had with us a chisel\r\nand a geological hammer, and by the aid of these we forced open the\r\nshutter serving as a window, and crept into the house; ten minutes later\r\na large wood fire was blazing up the chimney, our eatables were\r\nunpacked, some hot coffee was made, and we were supremely comfortable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Casa Inglesi and Cone of Etna]\r\n\r\nAt 3 a.m. we left the Casa Inglesi for the summit of the great crater,\r\n1,200 feet above us, in order to be in time to witness the sunrise. Our\r\nroad lay for a short distance over the upper portion of the Piano del\r\nLago, and the walking was difficult. The brighter stars had disappeared,\r\nand it was much darker than it had been some hours before. The guide led\r\nthe way with a lantern. The ascent of the cone was a very stiff piece of\r\nwork; it consists of loose ashes and blocks of lava, and slopes at an\r\nangle of \"45° or more\" according to one writer, and of 33° according to\r\nanother; probably the slope varies on different sides of the cone: we do\r\nnot think that the slope much exceeds 33° anywhere on the side of the\r\ncone which we ascended. Fortunately there was no strong wind, and we did\r\nnot suffer from the sickness of which travellers constantly complain in\r\nthe rarefied air of the summit. We reached the highest point at 4.30\r\na.m., and found a temperature of 47° F.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Hamilton ascended towards the end of June the\r\ntemperature at the base of the mountain was 84° F., and at the summit\r\n56° F. When Brydone left Catania on May 26th, 1770, the temperature was\r\n76° F., Bar. 29 in. 8-1/2 lines; at Nicolosi at midday on the 27th it\r\nwas 73° F., Bar. 27 in. 1-1/2 lines; at the Spelonca del Capriole (6,200\r\nfeet), 61° F., Bar. 26 in. 5-1/2 lines; at the foot of the crater, temp.\r\n33° F., Bar. 20 in. 4-1/2 lines, and at the summit of the crater just\r\nbefore sunrise, temp. 27° F., Bar. 19 in. 4 lines.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the summit we noticed that a quantity of steam and\r\nsulphurous acid gas issued from the ground under our feet, and in some\r\nplaces the cinders were so hot that it was necessary to choose a cool\r\nplace to sit down upon. A thermometer inserted just beneath the soil\r\nfrom which steam issued registered 182° F. For a short time we anxiously\r\nawaited the rising of the sun. Nearly all the stars had faded away; the\r\nvault of heaven was a pale blue, becoming a darker and darker grey\r\ntowards the west, where it appeared to be nearly black. Just before\r\nsunrise the sky had the appearance of an enormous arched spectrum,\r\nextremely extended at the blue end. Above the place where the sun would\r\npresently appear there was a brilliant red, shading off in the direction\r\nof the zenith to orange and yellow; this was succeeded by pale green,\r\nthen a long stretch of pale blue, darker blue, dark grey, ending\r\nopposite the rising sun with black. This effect was quite distinct, it\r\nlasted some minutes, and was very remarkable. This was succeeded by the\r\nusual rayed appearance of the rising sun, and at ten minutes to 5\r\no'clock the upper limb of the sun was seen above the mountains of\r\nCalabria. Examined by the spectroscope the Fraunhofer lines were\r\nextremely distinct, particularly two lines near the red end of the\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nThe top of the mountain was now illuminated, while all below was in\r\ncomparative darkness, and a light mist floated over the lower regions.\r\nWe were so fortunate as to witness a phenomenon which is not always\r\nvisible, viz., the projection of the triangular shadow of the mountain\r\nacross the island, a hundred miles away. The shadow appeared vertically\r\nsuspended in space at or beyond Palermo, and resting on a slightly misty\r\natmosphere; it gradually sank until it reached the surface of the\r\nisland, and as the sun rose it approached nearer and nearer to the base\r\nof the mountain. In a short time the flood of light destroyed the first\r\neffects of light and shadow. The mountains of Calabria and the west\r\ncoast of Italy appeared very close, and Stromboli and the Lipari Islands\r\nalmost under our feet; the east coast of Sicily could be traced until it\r\nended at Cape Passaro and turned to the west, forming the southern\r\nboundary of the island, while to the west distant mountains appeared. No\r\none would have the hardihood to attempt to describe the various\r\nimpressions which rapidly float through the mind during the\r\ncontemplation of sunrise from the summit of Etna. Brydone, who is by no\r\nmeans inclined to be rapturous or ecstatic in regard to the many\r\nwonderful sights he saw in the course of his tour, calls this \"the most\r\nwonderful and most sublime sight in nature.\" \"Here,\" he adds,\r\n\"description must ever fall short, for no imagination has dared to form\r\nan idea of so glorious and so magnificent a scene. Neither is there on\r\nthe surface of this globe any one point that unites so many awful and\r\nsublime objects. The immense elevation from the surface of the earth,\r\ndrawn as it were to a single point, without any neighbouring mountains\r\nfor the senses and imagination to rest upon, and recover from their\r\nastonishment in their way down to the world. This point or pinnacle,\r\nraised on the brink of a bottomless gulph, as old as the world, often\r\ndischarging rivers of fire and throwing out burning rocks with a noise\r\nthat shakes the whole island. Add to this, the unbounded extent of the\r\nprospect, comprehending the greatest diversity and the most beautiful\r\nscenery in nature, with the rising sun advancing in the east to\r\nilluminate the scene.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the sun had risen we had time to examine the crater, a vast abyss\r\nnearly 1000 feet in depth, and with very precipitous sides. Its\r\ndimensions vary, but it is now between two and three miles in\r\ncircumference. Sometimes it is nearly full of lava, at other times it\r\nappears to be bottomless. At the present time it is like an inverted\r\ncone; its sides are covered with incrustations of sulphur and ammonia\r\nsalts, and jets of steam perpetually issue from crevices. Near the\r\nsummit we found a deposit, several inches in thickness, of a white\r\nsubstance, apparently lava decomposed by the hot issuing gases.\r\nHydrochloric acid is said to frequently issue from the crater; the gases\r\nthat were most abundant appeared to be sulphurous acid and steam. The\r\ninterior of the crater appeared to be very similar to that of the\r\nSolfatara near Puzzuoli. During the descent from the cone we collected\r\nvarious specimens of ash and cinder, some red, others black and very\r\nvesicular, others crystalline, some pale pink. The steep slope of the\r\ncone was well shown by the fact that, although the surface is either\r\nextremely rugged owing to the accumulation of masses of lava, or soft\r\nand yielding on account of the depth of cinders, a large mass of lava\r\nset rolling at the top rushes down with increasing velocity until it\r\nbounds off to the level plain below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of the Val de Bove]\r\n\r\nThe great cone is formed by the accumulation of sand, scoriæ, and masses\r\nof rock ejected from the crater; it is oval in form, and has varied both\r\nin shape and size in the course of centuries. When we saw it, it was not\r\nfull of smoke or steam; but it was possible to see to the bottom of it,\r\nin spite of small jets of steam which issued from the sides. It\r\npresented the appearance of a profound funnel-shaped abyss; the sides of\r\nwhich were covered with an efflorescence of a red or yellow, and\r\nsometimes nearly white, colour. The crater presented the same appearance\r\nwhen it was seen by Captain Smyth in 1814, but he was so fortunate as to\r\nwitness it in a less quiescent state. \"While making these observations,\"\r\nhe writes, \"on a sudden the ground trembled under our feet, a harsh\r\nrumbling with sonorous thunder was heard, and volumes of heavy smoke\r\nrolled over the side of the crater, while a lighter one ascended\r\nvertically, with the electric fluid escaping from it in frequent flashes\r\nin every direction.... During some time the ground shook so violently\r\nthat we apprehended the whole cone would tumble into the burning gulf\r\n(as it actually had done several times before) and destroy us in the\r\nhorrible consequences; however, in less than a couple of hours all was\r\nagain clear above and quiet within.\" When Mr. Gladstone ascended in\r\n1838, the volcano was in a slight state of eruption: \"The great\r\nfeatures of this action,\" he writes, \"are the sharp and loud claps,\r\nwhich perceptibly shook from time to time the ground of the mountain\r\nunder our feet; the sheet of flame which leapt up with a sudden\r\nmomentary blast, and soon disappeared in smoke; then the shower of\r\nred-hot stones and lava. At this time, as we found on our way down, lava\r\nmasses of 150 or 200 pound weight were being thrown a distance of\r\nprobably a mile and a half; smaller ones we found even more remote.\r\nThese showers were most copious, and often came in the most rapid\r\nsuccession. Even while we were ascending the exterior of the cone, we\r\nsaw them alighting on its slope, and sometimes bounding down with\r\nimmense rapidity within, perhaps, some thirty or forty yards of our\r\nrickety footing on the mountain side. They dispersed like the sparks of\r\na rocket; they lay beneath the moon, over the mountain, thicker than\r\never the stars in heaven; the larger ones ascended as it were with\r\ndeliberation, and descended, first with speed and then with fury. Now\r\nthey passed even over our heads, and we could pick up some newly fallen,\r\nand almost intolerably hot. Lastly, there was the black grey column,\r\nwhich seemed smoke, and was really ash, and which was shot from time to\r\ntime out of the very bowels of the crater, far above its edge, in\r\nregular unbroken form.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Casa Inglesi we remounted the mules, and made a slight detour to\r\nthe east in order to look down into the Val del Bove, which is here seen\r\nas a gigantic valley, bounded on the north by the precipitous cliffs of\r\nthe Serra delle Concazze, and on the South by the Serra del Solfizio. It\r\nis believed by Lyell and others that in the Balzo di Trifoglietto, at\r\nwhich point the precipices are most profound and abrupt, there was a\r\nsecond permanent crater of eruption. The Torre del Filosofo, a ruined\r\ntower, traditionally the observatory of Empedocles, stands near the Casa\r\nInglesi. Not far from this a great deposit of ice was found in 1828. It\r\nwas preserved from melting by a layer of ashes and sand, which had\r\ncovered it, soon after its first existence, as a glacier: a stream of\r\nlava subsequently flowed over the ashes, and completely protected the\r\nice; the non-conducting power of the ashes prevented the lava from\r\nmelting the ice. The snow which falls on the mountain is stowed away in\r\ncaves, and used by the Sicilians during summer. A ship load is also sent\r\nto Malta, and the Archbishop of Catania derives a good deal of his\r\nincome from the sale of Etna snow.\r\n\r\nDuring our descent from the mountain we were much struck by the apparent\r\nnearness of the minor cones beneath us, and of the villages at the base\r\nof the mountain. They seemed to be painted on a vertical wall in front\r\nof us, and although from ten to fifteen miles distant they appeared to\r\nbe almost within a stone's throw. This curious effect, which has often\r\nbeen observed before, is due to refraction. At the summit of Etna we\r\nhave left one-third of the atmosphere beneath us, and the air is now\r\npressing upon the surface of the earth with a weight of ten pounds on\r\nthe square inch, instead of the usual fifteen pounds experienced at the\r\nlevel of the sea. In looking towards the base of the mountain we are\r\nconsequently looking from a rarer to a denser medium; and it is a law of\r\noptics, that when light passes from a denser to a rarer medium it is\r\nrefracted away from the perpendicular, and thus the object, from which\r\nit emanates, appears raised, and nearer to us than it really is. The\r\nobjects around Etna appear near to us and raised vertically from the\r\nhorizon for the same reason that a stick plunged in water appears bent.\r\n\r\nWe reached Nicolosi again about noon, having left it eighteen hours\r\nbefore. The ascent of the mountain, although it does not involve much\r\nhard walking, is somewhat trying on account of the extremes of\r\ntemperature which have to be endured. In the course of the morning of\r\nour descent we had experienced a difference equal to more than 40° F. As\r\nto the ascent, you are moving upwards nearly all night; you have six\r\nhours of riding on a mule, some of it in a bitterly cold atmosphere; you\r\nget very much heated by the final steep climb of 1100 feet, and you find\r\nat the summit a piercing wind; of course there is no shelter, and you\r\nsit down to wait for sunrise on cinders which are gently giving off\r\nsteam and sulphurous acid; the former condenses to water as soon as it\r\nmeets the cold air, and you find your great coat, or the rug on which\r\nyou have sat down, speedily saturated with moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTOWNS SITUATED ON THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n    Paterno.--Ste. Maria di Licodia.--The site of the ancient town of\r\n    Aetna.--Biancavilla.--Aderno.--Sicilian Inns.--Adranum.--Bronte.--\r\n    Randazzo.--Mascali.--Giarre.--Aci Reale.--Its position.--The Scogli\r\n    de'Ciclopi.--Catania, its early history, and present condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before alluded to the fact that Etna is far more thickly\r\npopulated than any other part of Sicily or Italy; in fact, more so than\r\nalmost any equal area in the world, of course excepting large cities and\r\ntheir neighbourhood. This is due to the wonderful fertility of the soil,\r\nthe salubrity of the climate, and, on the eastern base, to the proximity\r\nof a sea-coast indented with excellent harbours. The habitable zone of\r\nEtna is restricted to the _Regione Coltivata_, nevertheless some of the\r\ntowns on the north and west have a considerable elevation; thus Bronte\r\nis 2,782 feet above the sea, and Randazzo 2,718. All the principal towns\r\nare situated on the base road of the mountain, which was indeed\r\nconstructed in order to connect them. Out of the sixty-four towns and\r\nvillages on the mountain, the following are the most important:\r\nCatania, Aci Reale, Paterno, Aderno, Bronte, Randazzo, Aci S. Antonio,\r\nBiancavilla, Calatabiano, Giarre, Francavilla, Linguagrossa, Licodia,\r\nMascali, Misterbianco, Nicolosi, Pedara, Piedemonte, Trecastagne, and\r\nTremestieri.\r\n\r\nOn our return from the summit, we rested for awhile at Nicolosi, and in\r\nthe cool of the evening started to make a _giro_ of the mountain by way\r\nof the base road. Descending by the Nicolosi road as far as Mascalucia,\r\nwe branched off to the west, and made for Paterno, passing near the town\r\nof Belpasso, which was destroyed by the earthquake of 1669, and\r\nsubsequently erected on a new site. It still contains more than 7,000\r\ninhabitants, although the district is extremely unhealthy.\r\n\r\nPaterno, the second largest town on the flanks of Etna after Catania and\r\nAci Reale, stands in the very heart of the Regione Coltivata, and\r\npossesses more than 16,000 inhabitants. According to Cluverius, it is\r\nthe site of the city of Hybla Major (~Hybla Megalê~), a Sikelian\r\ncity which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Athenians soon after they\r\nfirst landed in Sicily. During the second Punic War, the inhabitants\r\nwent over to the Carthagenians, but the city was speedily recovered by\r\nthe Romans. Pliny, Cicero, and Pausanias allude to it, but its later\r\nhistory has not come down to us. An altar was lately found in Paterno\r\ndedicated to _Veneri Victrici Hyblensi_. Several towns in Sicily were\r\ncalled Hybla, probably--according to Pausanias--in honour of a local\r\ndeity. Paterno was founded by Roger I. in 1073: it was once a feudal\r\ncity of some importance, and possessed a cathedral and castle, and\r\nseveral large monasteries. Although much fallen to decay, it still\r\npossesses a good deal of vitality, and the population is on the\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Paterno the road turns to the North-west, and passes through\r\nthe village of Ste. Maria di Licodia. Here originally stood the Sikelian\r\nCity of Inessa (~Inêssa~), which, after the death of Hiero I.,\r\nwas peopled by colonists from Katana (then called ~Aitnê~). The\r\nnew occupants of the city changed its name from Inessa to Aetna, which\r\nit retained. The town later fell into the hands of the Syracusans, and\r\nin 462 B.C. the Athenians in vain attempted to take it. During the\r\nAthenian expedition both Aetna and Hybla were allies of Syracuse. In 403\r\nB.C. Aetna was taken by Dionysius, who placed in it a body of Campanian\r\nmercenaries. Sixty-four years later (B.C. 339) the town was taken by\r\nTimoleon. For many succeeding years we find no further mention of it.\r\nCicero speaks of it in his time as an important place, and the centre of\r\na very fertile district; it is also mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy, and\r\nStrabo says that it was usually the starting point for those who\r\nascended the mountain. Of its later history we know absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix miles to the north-west of St. Mariah di Licodia, the road passes\r\nthrough Biancavilla--a town of 13,000 inhabitants, and the centre of a\r\ncotton district.\r\n\r\nThe road continues in the same direction until the town of Aderno is\r\nreached; and here we arrived late in the evening, and gained our first\r\nexperience of a Sicilian inn in an out-of-the-way town. After many\r\nenquiries we were directed to the only inn which the place could boast,\r\nkept by a doctor. No one appeared at or near the entrance, of course\r\nthere was no bell or knocker, and we made our way up a dark stone\r\nstaircase till we arrived at a dimly-lighted passage. A horrible old\r\nSicilian woman now appeared, and showed us with great incivility the\r\nonly room in the house, which its inmates were willing to place at our\r\ndisposal. It was a fairly large room, with a stone floor which\r\napparently had not been swept for weeks, and walls that had once been\r\nwhitewashed; the furniture consisted of three beds placed on tressels, a\r\nplain deal table, and some primitive chairs. As to food they had neither\r\nbread, meat, wine, eggs, macaroni, fruit, or butter in the house;\r\nneither did they offer to procure anything. Even when some eggs had been\r\nobtained, and (after an hour's delay) cooked, there was not a single\r\nteaspoon to eat them with. The people of the town appear to subsist\r\nchiefly on beans and a kind of dried fish. If our courier had not been a\r\nvery handy fellow and a tolerable cook, we should have been obliged\r\nmore than once to go to bed supperless. As it was, the best he could do\r\non this occasion was to get some bread, eggs, and wine, and--best of\r\nall--some snow, for the heat was intolerable. In a town of the same\r\nsize--15,657 inhabitants--in England, we should have at least two really\r\ncomfortable inns ready at any moment to receive and entertain the weary\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Etna from Bronte]\r\n\r\nAderno stands on the site, and has preserved the name, of the ancient\r\nSikelian city of Adranum (~Adranon~). According to Diodorus there\r\nexisted here, from very early times, the temple of a local deity named\r\nAdranus. The city was founded by the elder Dionysius in 400 B.C.; it\r\nowed its importance to the renown of its temple, which was guarded by a\r\nthousand dogs. In 345 B.C. the city fell into the hands of Timoleon, and\r\nit was taken by the Romans at the commencement of the first Punic War.\r\nAfter this we cease to hear of it. The modern town was founded by Roger\r\nI. in the 12th century. The fine Norman tower--now used as a prison--and\r\nthe monastery, were both built by King Roger.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Aderno the base-road ascends, turns nearly due north, and\r\nleads us past a number of lava streams, notably those of 1610, 1603, and\r\n1651. A good view of Monte Minardo, and the minor cones in its more\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, is obtained on the left, while on the right we\r\nsee the Valley of the Simeto, and Centorbi high upon the hills.\r\n\r\nNearly due west of the great crater is the town of Bronte, which is\r\n2,782 feet above the sea, and has a population of more than 15,000. It\r\nis a very primitive place, and several centuries behind the age; it\r\nreminded us forcibly, in one or two particulars, of Pompeii: the streets\r\nare narrow and tortuous, and the roadway very uneven. Awnings are\r\nsometimes hung across the street from side to side to provide shade. The\r\nshops are exactly like those at Pompeii; and in the main street we\r\nnoticed an open-air kitchen, to which the would-be diner repairs,\r\npurchases a plateful of food, and eats it standing in the public way.\r\nThe inn was even worse than that of Aderno, and apparently had never\r\nbefore received guests. We were offered one miserable room, without a\r\nlock to the door, and unprovided with either table or chair. Of course\r\nthe bare idea of offering to procure, or furnish, or cook, any kind of\r\nfood was too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. With difficulty\r\nthe courier obtained some eggs, macaroni, and fruit, on which we dined\r\nin a small barn attached to a wine-shop.\r\n\r\nAt Bronte we are only nine miles from the crater, on the steepest side\r\nof the mountain, and near the Tertiary sandstone which underlies this\r\nportion of the mountain. A short distance outside the town we saw great\r\nbeds of the lava of 1832, piled up fantastically in all sorts of forms,\r\nand excessively rugged and uneven. It is quite bare of vegetation, and\r\ndoes not appear to have even commenced to be decomposed.\r\n\r\nBronte gave its name to Lord Nelson, who was created Duke of Bronte by\r\nFerdinand IV.:--an appropriate name for a great warrior ([Greek:\r\nbrontê], thunder). The Nelson estates are scattered around the town.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Bronte the road conducted us past several high hills of\r\nsandstone and quartzite near Monte Rivoglia; then we passed near\r\nMaletto, and, leaving the malarious lake Gurrita on our left, we soon\r\nafter arrived at Randazzo. Near Maletto the road reaches it highest\r\npoint--3,852 feet.\r\n\r\nThe town of Randazzo was founded by the Lombards in the 10th century;\r\nduring the Middle Ages it appears to have been a prosperous, populous,\r\nplace; at present it possesses more than 8,000 inhabitants. The Emperor\r\nFrederick II. created his son Duke of Randazzo, and added to the name of\r\nthe town, _Etnea_. It contains several very interesting architectural\r\nremains; a church of the 13th century, a mediæval palace--the Palazzo\r\nFinochiaro,--and a ducal palace now used as a prison. The houses are for\r\nthe most part built of lava, and some of the shops have massive lava\r\ncounters extending half across their open front, while the door occupies\r\nthe remainder, as at Pompeii. The view from Randazzo is very fine in\r\nevery direction; the crater of Etna appears near, and Monte\r\nSpagnuolo--many hours distant--just outside the town. The town is 2,718\r\nfeet above the sea, just above the Valley of the Alcantara--of which it\r\ncommands a fine view, and also of the limestone hills on the other side.\r\n\r\nWe were obliged to pass the night in the town, in an inn scarcely\r\nsuperior to that of Aderno, but distinctly better than the miserable\r\nAlbergo Collegio at Bronte. At least the people were civil, and did\r\ntheir best. The one room of the inn had a bed in each corner, and a deal\r\ntable in the middle. Three of the beds were occupied by engineers who\r\nwere surveying in connection with a new line of railway; the fourth was\r\nmade over to the courier. I slept in a small kind of ante-room on a bed\r\nchiefly composed of deal boards placed on tressels. Here again the\r\ncourier was invaluable, in fact it would be simply impossible to make\r\nthe circuit of Etna without a courier. He procured some eggs, macaroni,\r\nfruit, snow, tomatoes, and even meat, and cooked everything well,\r\nwithout a trace of garlic. He also took care that the linen was clean,\r\nand the general arrangements as comfortable as they could be under the\r\ncircumstances. Let us also admit that neither at Aderno, Bronte, nor\r\nRandazzo were we troubled with musquitoes or any worse species of\r\ninsect. These, we were assured, would appear in full force in the\r\nfollowing month (September). Our only inconvenience of this nature\r\narose from swarms of flies. The inns of these out-of-the-way towns\r\nprobably receive scarcely a dozen travellers in the year, and these are\r\nSicilians, who are not used to better accommodation. Evidently a\r\n_forestiare_ is quite a novelty: the people of these small towns used to\r\nlook at us with great curiosity, and crowded round the carriage when we\r\nstarted. At Bronte we had a good example of this curiosity: owing to the\r\nhardness of the lava of 1832 the head had come off the handle of our\r\nhammer, and we went into a carpenter's shop to have it put on again.\r\nPresently we noticed that eleven people, including a priest, were\r\nlooking on, apparently with intense and absorbing interest.\r\n\r\nFrom Randazzo the base-road descends, until at Giarre it is near the\r\nsea-level. This road is one of the most beautiful in Sicily; it is part\r\nof the old military route from Messina to Palermo, and it was traversed\r\nby Himilco in 396 B.C.; by Timoleon in 344 B.C.; and by Charles V. in\r\n1534. After leaving Randazzo the valley of the Alcantara becomes\r\nvisible, while beyond it rise the lofty mountains of the Nebrodes. The\r\nroad passes near Monte Dolce, and soon reaches Linguaglossa, a small\r\ntown from whence the craters of 1865 may be reached in about four hours.\r\nThe rapidly descending road passes through Piedemonte and Mascali, in\r\nthe heart of an extraordinarily fertile region. Mascali, a village of\r\n3050 inhabitants, was considered by Cluverius to be the site of the\r\nGreek town of Callipolis, founded by a colony from Naxos as early as the\r\nfifth century, B.C. A full view of the coast line is obtained from the\r\nCapo di Taormina on the north, to a point below Riposto on the south. We\r\ndescended through plantations of nuts, and groves of oranges and lemons,\r\nto gentle slopes covered with vineyards.\r\n\r\nFrom the town of Giarre, (17,965 inhabitants), we get a view of the Val\r\ndel Bove, which, however, is almost always obscured by thin white\r\nclouds, while the summit of the mountain is clear. We noticed, indeed,\r\nevery day that the summit, which had been absolutely clear all the day\r\nand night, became covered with clouds shortly before sunset, while about\r\nan hour later the clouds cleared off, and the mountain was sharply\r\ndefined against the sky during the starlit night. Some of the effects of\r\nsunset behind clouds resting on the summit, while all the rest of the\r\nsky was bright blue, were exceedingly beautiful, and were quite\r\nuntranslatable into any known language, save that of painting, and of\r\nmusic. Perhaps Turner could have done justice to them.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Giarre we passed through a good deal of highly cultivated\r\nland belonging to Baron Pennisi, the largest landholder and richest man\r\nin Sicily. He makes good use of his wealth, and seems to be very\r\npopular among all classes. He possesses three palaces in Aci Reale, and\r\nhas done a great deal to beautify the town. Archæologists will remember\r\nhim as the possessor of the finest collection of Sicilian coins in the\r\nworld. Many of these have been found on his own estates, but he never\r\nscruples to give large sums of money for any coin which he covets.\r\n\r\nAci Reale, one of the prettiest towns in Europe, is situated in the\r\nmidst of a very fertile region 550 feet above the sea. To the east it\r\nfaces the Ionian sea, while on the west towers Etna. The town is full of\r\nwealthy inhabitants, and the houses are large, lofty, and well built. It\r\ncontains 24,151 inhabitants, and possesses celebrated sulphur baths, and\r\none of the best hotels in Sicily. The wealth of this small town is well\r\nshown by the following fact: Since its foundation in the tenth century,\r\ntill within a year or two of the present time, the town had been under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Catania. It happened, however, a\r\nfew years ago, on the occasion of a religious procession in Catania,\r\nthat the people of Aci considered that their patron Saint, S. Venera,\r\nwas slighted. In fact the image of S. Agata, the patron Saint of the\r\nCatanese--whose veil has so often averted the lava-streams from the\r\ncity--was put in all the prominent parts of the procession, while the\r\nimage of S. Venera was comparatively neglected. The people of Aci at\r\nonce returned home, and sent a petition to the Pope, praying that they\r\nmight have a Bishop of their own directly subject to the Holy See, in\r\norder that they might no longer be subjected to such slights. The\r\nVatican having duly considered the question consented to raise Aci to\r\nthe dignity of a Bishopric, and to pay the Bishop a yearly stipend of\r\n10,000 lire, (about £400, but equal to £600 in Sicily), on condition\r\nthat 200,000 lire were paid at once into the coffers of the Vatican.\r\nThis was promptly done, and now Monsignore Gerlando Genuardi, Bishop of\r\nAci Reale, may snap his fingers in the face of Monsignore Giuseppe\r\nBenedetto Dusmet, a Benedictine of the Congregation of Monte Cassino,\r\nand Archbishop of Catania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Island of Columnar Basalt off Trezza]\r\n\r\nSix villages in the neighbourhood of Aci Reale bear the name of Aci: Aci\r\nCastello, Aci Sant' Antonio, and so on, but Aci Reale claims to stand\r\nupon the very site rendered memorable by the story of Acis and Galatea.\r\nThe river Acis (now called _Acque Grande_) rises from a bed of lava, and\r\nfalls into the sea a mile from its source. Aci Reale stands on seven\r\ndifferent beds of superposed lava, having layers of earth resulting from\r\ndecomposed lava between. The Canon Recupero calculated from observation,\r\nthat a lava requires at least 2000 years to form even a scanty layer of\r\nearth, consequently he inferred that the lowest of the lava streams upon\r\nwhich Aci rests must have been formed 14,000 years ago. These views he\r\nstated to Brydone a hundred years ago; the latter says, \"Recupero tells\r\nme he is exceedingly embarrassed by these discoveries in writing the\r\nhistory of the mountain. That Moses hangs like a dead weight upon him,\r\nand blunts all his zeal for enquiry; for that really he has not the\r\nconscience to make his mountain so young as that prophet makes the\r\nworld. What do you think of these sentiments from a Roman Catholic\r\nDivine? The Bishop, who is strenuously orthodox--for it is an excellent\r\nSee--has already warned him to be upon his guard, and not to pretend to\r\nbe a better natural historian than Moses; not to presume to urge\r\nanything that may, in the smallest degree, be deemed contradictory to\r\nhis sacred authority.\" The Canon Recupero lost his church preferment on\r\nthe publication of Brydone's book, and the whole body of clergy of\r\nGirgenti received a reprimand on account of a capital story which\r\nBrydone told of a dinner at which the Bishop presided, during which\r\nseveral of the reverend Canons suffered severely from the effects of\r\nEnglish punch, which Brydone had brewed for them. We quite agree with\r\nAdmiral Smyth when he says, \"It is a pity that Mr. Brydone laboured\r\nunder such a cacoethes, as to sacrifice a friend for the sake of a good\r\nstory.\" Of course we now know that Recupero's estimate of the age of\r\nEtna was far within the true limits, but we derive this information\r\nfrom other sources. No true estimate can be obtained from the\r\nobservation of the decomposition of lavas, for it has been often\r\nobserved that two lavas will decompose at very different rates.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of the village of La Scaletta, at the base of the\r\nrocks upon which Aci Reale stands, there are two small caverns in the\r\nabrupt face of the basalt, which can only be approached in a boat. They\r\nconsist of columnar basalt bent very curiously, and capped by amorphous\r\nbasalt.\r\n\r\nA drive of a few miles to the South of Aci Reale brings us to Trezza, a\r\nsmall village built of lava. A short distance from the shore are the\r\ncelebrated _Scogli di Ciclopi_, or rocks of the Cyclops, said to be\r\nthose which Polyphemus hurled at Ulysses after his escape from the cave.\r\nThe rocks, seven in number, form small islets, the largest of which, the\r\nIsola d'Aci, is about 3000 feet in circumference, and 150 feet high. It\r\nconsists of crudely columnar basalt capped by a kind of marl. Near the\r\ntop of the island there is a cave called the \"Grotto of Polyphemus,\"\r\nalso a cistern of water. To the south of this island a very picturesque\r\nrock rises from the sea. It is 2000 feet in circumference and about 200\r\nfeet in height, and consists of columnar basalt in four and eight-sided\r\nprisms, but not very regular; a hard calcareous substance is found in\r\ntheir interstices. Fine crystals of analcime are sometimes met with in\r\nthe basalts of the Cyclops Islands. Lyell considers these basalts \"the\r\nmost ancient monuments of volcanic action within the region of Etna.\"\r\n\r\nA few miles south of the Isole di Ciclopi are the bay and city of\r\nCatania. We started from the latter when we commenced our ascent of\r\nEtna, and now on returning to it, we completed the circuit of the\r\nmountain by its base-road of 87 miles.\r\n\r\nKatana (~Katanê~) is believed to have been founded about 730 B.C.\r\nby a Greek colony of Naxos, which had originally come from Chalcis. The\r\ncity maintained its independence till the time of Hieron, who expelled\r\nthe original inhabitants in 476 B.C., and peopled the city with\r\nSyracusans and inhabitants of the Peloponnesus to the number of 10,000.\r\nAt the same time the name of the city was changed to Aetna ([Greek:\r\nAitnê]). In 461 B.C., however, the old inhabitants retook their city,\r\nand drove out the newly-settled strangers, who betook themselves to\r\nInessa, occupied it, and changed its name to _Aetna_. At a later period\r\nthe Katanians sided with the Athenians against the Syracusans. But in\r\n403 B.C. Dionysius of Syracuse took and plundered the city, sold the\r\ninhabitants as slaves, and established in it a body of Campanian\r\nmercenaries. The latter quitted it and retired to Aetna in 396 B.C.,\r\nwhen the city was taken by the Carthaginians after a battle off the\r\nrocks of the Cyclops. Katana submitted to the Romans in 263 B.C.,\r\nduring the first Punic War, and it soon became a very populous city.\r\nCicero mentions it as a wealthy city and important seaport. During the\r\nMiddle Ages it underwent many changes both at the hands of nature and of\r\nman; it belonged in succession to the Goths, Saracens, and Normans; and\r\nin 1169 was destroyed by an earthquake, during which 15,000 of its\r\ninhabitants perished. Again in 1669, and 1693, it was almost destroyed\r\nby earthquakes. The present town is comparatively new, many of its more\r\nancient remains are covered with lava, among them the remains of a fine\r\nGreco-Roman theatre, in which it is probable that Alcibiades addressed\r\nthe Catanians in 415 B.C. There are also remains of a Roman\r\namphitheatre, bath, and tombs. Of more modern structures, the cathedral\r\nis the first to claim our notice. It was commenced by Roger I. in 1091,\r\nbut in less than a century was almost entirely destroyed by an\r\nearthquake. At one corner of the building you descend through a narrow\r\npassage cut in the lava, to a crypt in which some ancient Roman arches\r\nare shown, partly filled up with lava. Here also is seen a small stream\r\nof very clear water flowing through the lava. The cathedral contains\r\nseveral interesting tombs, and in the chapel of S. Agata, her body is\r\npreserved in a silver sarcophagus, which during certain fetes is carried\r\nthrough the town in procession, attended by all the authorities. S.\r\nAgata was martyred by the Prætor Quintianus in the reign of Decius, and\r\nis the patron saint of the city. Whenever Catania has been in trouble\r\nfrom the approach of lava streams, or from earthquakes, the veil of S.\r\nAgata has been used as a charm to avert the evil.\r\n\r\nThe University of Catania is the most celebrated in Sicily. It was\r\nfounded in 1445 by Alfonso of Arragon, and has produced several men of\r\neminence. The city also possesses one of the finest monasteries in the\r\nworld, now converted into schools and barracks. Formerly the monastery\r\nof S. Nicola was occupied by 40 monks, all members of noble families; it\r\nis sufficiently large to hold 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nERUPTIONS OF THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n    Their frequency within the historical period.--525 B.C.--477 B.C.--\r\n    426 B.C.--396 B.C.--140 B.C.--134 B.C.--126 B.C.--122 B.C.--49 B.C.\r\n    --43 B.C.--38 B.C.--32 B.C.--40 A.D.--72.--253.--420.--812.--1169.\r\n    --1181.--1285.--1329.--1333.--1371.--1408.--1444.--1446.--1447.--\r\n    Close of the Fifteenth Century.--1536.--1537--1566.--1579.--1603.--\r\n    1607.--1610.--1614.--1619.--1633.--1646.--1651.--1669.--1682.--1688.\r\n    --1689.--1693.--1694.--1702.--1723.--1732.--1735.--1744.--1747.--\r\n    1755.--Flood of 1755.--1759.--1763.--1766.--1780.--1781.--1787.--\r\n    1792.--1797.--1798.--1799.--1800.--1802.--1805.--1808.--1809.--1811.\r\n    --1819.--1831.--1832.--1838.--1842.--1843.--1852.--1865.--1874.--\r\n    General character of the Eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA list of all the eruptions of Etna from the earliest times has been\r\ngiven by several writers, notably by Ferrara in his _Descrizione\r\ndell' Etna_, and by Gemellaro. The latter places the first eruption in\r\n1226 B.C. in the time of the Sicani; the second in 1170 B.C.; and of the\r\nthird he says, \"In 1149 B.C. there was an eruption, and Hercules in\r\nconsequence fled from the island.\" Of course these dates are worthless,\r\nand the statements are no doubt based upon the assertion of Diodorus,\r\nthat before the Trojan war the Sicani were driven from the east side of\r\nSicily by the eruptions of the volcano.\r\n\r\n1. The first eruption appears to have occurred in the time of\r\nPythagoras; we have no details as to its nature.\r\n\r\n2. The second eruption occurred in 477 B.C. It is mentioned by\r\nThucydides, and it must be the eruption to which Pindar and Æschylus\r\nallude. The former visited the tomb of Hiero I. of Syracuse in 473 B.C.,\r\nand the latter was in Sicily in 471 B.C. On the occasion of this\r\neruption, two heroic youths named Anapias and Amphinomus,\r\nperformed a deed to which Seneca and other writers allude with\r\nenthusiasm. While the lava was rapidly overwhelming the city of Katana,\r\nthey placed their aged parents on their shoulders, and, at the risk of\r\ntheir lives, bore them through the flaming streets, and succeeded in\r\nplacing them in safety. It was said that the fiery stream of lava parted\r\nto make way for them. Statues were raised to the honour of the _Pii\r\nFratres_, and their burial place was long known as the _Campus Piorum_.\r\nEven a temple was erected to commemorate the deed.\r\n\r\nLucilius Junior devotes the concluding lines of his poem on Etna to the\r\nglory of the brothers: \"The flames blushed to touch the filial youths,\r\nand wherever they plant their footsteps, they retire. That day is a day\r\nof fortune; harmless that land. On their right hand fierce dangers\r\nprevail; on their left are burning fires. Athwart the flames they pass\r\nin triumph, his brother and he, each safe beneath his filial burden.\r\nThere the devouring fire flees backward, and checks itself round the\r\ntwin pair. At length they issue forth unharmed, and bear with them their\r\ndeities in safety. Songs of poets honour and admire them; them has Pluto\r\nplaced apart beneath a glorious name, nor can the mean Fates reach the\r\nholy youths, but have truly granted them the homes and dominion of the\r\nblessed.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Translated by L. E. Upcott, M.A.\r\n\r\n3. The third eruption occurred in the year 426 B.C. It is mentioned by\r\nThucydides as having commenced in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian\r\nWar. It destroyed a portion of the territory of the inhabitants of\r\nKatana.\r\n\r\n4. An important eruption occurred in the year 396 B.C. It broke out from\r\nMonte di Mojo, the most northerly of the minor cones of Etna, and\r\nfollowing the course of the river Acesines, (now the Alcantara) entered\r\nthe sea at the site of the ancient Greek colony of Naxos. Himilco the\r\nCarthaginian general, was at this time on his way from Messana to\r\nSyracuse, and he was compelled to march his troops round the west side\r\nof the mountain in order to avoid the stream of lava.\r\n\r\n5. We hear of no further eruption for 256 years, when in the year 140\r\nB.C., in the consulship of C. Lælius Sapiens and Q. Servilius Cæpio,\r\nthere was an outburst from the volcano which destroyed 40 people.\r\n\r\n6. Six years later an eruption occurred according to Orosius and Julius\r\nObsequens, in the consulship of Sergius Fulvius Flaccus, and Quintus\r\nCalpurnius Piso. We have no details concerning its nature or extent.\r\n\r\n7. The same authorities state that in the year 126 B.C. in the\r\nconsulship of L. OEmilius Lepidus, and L. Aurelius Orestes, Sicily\r\nsuffered from a very severe earthquake, and a deluge of fiery matter\r\npoured from Etna, overwhelming large tracts of country, and rendering\r\nthe waters of the adjacent Ionian sea positively hot. It is said that\r\nthe sea near the island of Lipari boiled, and that the inhabitants ate\r\nso large a number of the fishes which were cast, already cooked, upon\r\ntheir shores, that a distemper appeared which destroyed a large number\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n8. Four years later Katana was nearly destroyed by a new eruption. The\r\nroofs of many of the houses were broken in by the weight of hot ashes\r\nwhich fell upon them; but the lava stream turned aside near the city and\r\nflowed into the sea. The lava is believed to have issued from a small\r\ncrater near Gravina, about 2-1/2 miles from Katana. The city was so much\r\ninjured by this eruption that the Romans granted the inhabitants an\r\nimmunity from all taxes for a space of ten years.\r\n\r\n9. An eruption, of which we have no details, occurred during the civil\r\nwar between Cæsar and Pompey.\r\n\r\n10. Livy speaks of an eruption and earthquake which took place shortly\r\nbefore the death of Cæsar, which it was believed to portend.\r\n\r\n11. In 38 B.C., during the civil war between Octavianus and Sextus\r\nPompeius, a violent eruption occurred on the east side of the mountain,\r\naccompanied by fearful noises and outbursts of flame.\r\n\r\n12. Six years afterwards an eruption of a less violent character took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n13. The next eruption of which we hear is that mentioned by Suetonius in\r\nhis Life of Caligula. The Emperor happened to be at Messina at the time,\r\nand he fled from the town through fear of the eruption. This was in 40\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\n14. An eruption is said to have occurred in 72, in the second year after\r\nthe capture of Jerusalem by Titus.\r\n\r\n15. Etna was now quiescent for nearly two centuries, but in the year\r\n253, in the reign of the Emperor Decius, a violent eruption lasting nine\r\ndays occurred. The lava flowed in the direction of Catania, and the\r\ninhabitants for the first time tested the efficacy of the veil of S.\r\nAgatha, which afterwards stood them in such good stead on more than one\r\noccasion. The Saint had been martyred the year before, and when the\r\nfrightened inhabitants saw the stream of lava approaching the city,\r\nthey rushed to the tomb, and removed the veil which covered her body.\r\nThis was carried to the edge of the descending torrent of lava, and is\r\nasserted to have at once arrested its progress.\r\n\r\n16. According to Carrera and Photius an eruption occurred in the year\r\n420.\r\n\r\n17. We now find no record of any volcanic action for nearly four hundred\r\nyears. Geoffrey of Viterbo states that an eruption occurred in 812, when\r\nCharlemagne was in Messina.\r\n\r\n18. After another long interval of more than three centuries and a half,\r\nthe mountain again entered into eruption. In February, 1169, occurred\r\none of the most disastrous eruptions on record. A violent earthquake,\r\nwhich was felt as far as Reggio, occurred about dawn, and in a few\r\nminutes Catania was a heap of ruins. It is estimated that 15,000 persons\r\nwere buried beneath the ruins. It was the vigil of the feast of S.\r\nAgatha, and the Cathedral of Catania was crowded with people, who were\r\nall buried beneath the ruins, together with the Bishop and forty-four\r\nBenedictine monks. The side of the cone of the great crater towards\r\nTaormina fell into the crater. At Messina the sea retired to some\r\ndistance from the shore, and then suddenly returned, overwhelming a\r\nportion of the city, and sweeping away a number of persons who had fled\r\nto the shore for safety. The clear and pure fountain of Arethusa at\r\nSyracuse became muddy and brackish; while the fountain of Ajo, near the\r\nvillage of Saraceni, ceased to flow for two hours, and then emitted\r\nwater of the colour of blood. Ludovico Aurelio states that the vines,\r\ncorn, and trees were burnt up over large districts.\r\n\r\n19. According to Nicolo Speziale, there was a great eruption from the\r\neastern side of the mountain in 1181.\r\n\r\n20. A stream of lava is said to have burst from the eastern side of the\r\nmountain in 1285, when Charles of Anjou was on his death-bed, and to\r\nhave flowed fifteen miles.\r\n\r\n21. In the year 1329 Niccolo Speziale was in Catania, and witnessed the\r\neruption of which he has left us an account. On the evening of June\r\n28th, about the hour of vespers, Etna was strongly convulsed, terrible\r\nnoises were emitted, and flames issued from the south side of the\r\nmountain. A new crater--Monte Lepre--opened in the Val del Bove above\r\nthe rock of Musarra, and emitted large quantities of dense black smoke.\r\nSoon afterwards a torrent of lava poured from the crater, and red-hot\r\nmasses of rock were projected into the air. These effects continued till\r\nthe 15th of July, when a second crater opened ten miles to the S.E. of\r\nMontelepre, and near the Church of S. Giovanni Paparometto. Soon after\r\nfour other craters opened around it, and emitted smoke and lava. The\r\nsun was obscured from morning till evening by the smoke and ashes, and\r\nthe adjacent fields were burnt up by the hot sand and ashes. Multitudes\r\nof birds and animals perished, and many persons are said to have died\r\nfrom terror. The lava streams were divided into three portions, two of\r\nwhich flowed towards Aci, and the third towards Catania. The ashes were\r\ncarried as far as Malta, a distance of 130 miles.\r\n\r\n22. Four years afterwards an eruption is recorded by Silvaggio.\r\n\r\n23. A manuscript preserved in the archives of the Cathedral of Catania\r\nmentions an eruption which occurred on the 6th of August, 1371, which\r\ncaused the destruction of numerous olive groves near the city.\r\n\r\n24. An eruption which lasted for twelve days commenced on the 9th of\r\nNovember, 1408; it originated in the great crater, but several mouths\r\nsubsequently opened near the base of the mountain. Large quantities of\r\nred-hot ashes were emitted, some of which fell in Calabria. The villages\r\nof Pedara and Tre Castagne suffered severely from this eruption.\r\n\r\n25. A violent earthquake in 1444 caused the upper cone of the mountain\r\nto fall into the crater. A torrent of lava also issued from the\r\nmountain, and moved for a space of twenty days towards Catania, but it\r\ndid not reach the city.\r\n\r\n26. Two years later lava issued from the Val del Bove near the Rock of\r\nMusarra; the crater then formed was perhaps the present Monte Finocchio.\r\n\r\n27. A short eruption, of which we have no details, occurred in 1447:\r\nafter which Etna was quiescent for 89 years.\r\n\r\n28. Bembo and Fazzello mention an eruption which occurred towards the\r\nclose of the 15th century, during which a current of lava flowed from\r\nthe great crater, and destroyed a portion of Catania. In 1533 Filoteo,\r\nof whom we have before spoken as one of the earliest historians of Etna,\r\ndescended into the crater, which possessed its present funnel-like form.\r\nHe found at the bottom a hole, not larger than a man's head, from which\r\nissued a thin moist sulphurous vapour.\r\n\r\n29. In March, 1536, a quantity of lava issued from the great crater, and\r\nseveral new apertures opened near the summit of the mountain and emitted\r\nlava. It divided into several streams, flowing in different directions,\r\none towards Randazzo, a second towards Aderno, and a third towards\r\nBronte. The lava swept everything before it; at the same time quantities\r\nof smoke and ashes were ejected, the mountain was convulsed, and fearful\r\nnoises were heard. Three new craters were formed on the south and west\r\nsides of the mountain, and on the 26th of March twelve new craters, or\r\n_bocche_, opened between Monte Manfre and Monte Vituri. A physician of\r\nLentini, named Negro di Piazza, having approached too near to the scene\r\nof the eruption, was destroyed by a volley of red-hot stones. Several\r\nrifts were formed in the sides of the mountain from which issued flames\r\nand hot cinders.\r\n\r\n30. A year later, in May, 1537, a fresh outburst occurred; a number of\r\nnew mouths were opened on the south slope of the mountain near La\r\nFontanelle, and a quantity of lava was emitted, which flowed in the\r\ndirection of Catania, destroying a part of Nicolosi, and S. Antonio. In\r\nfour days the lava had run fifteen miles. At the same time violent\r\nshocks of earthquake occurred all over Sicily, the inhabitants thought\r\nthat the last day had come, and many prepared for their end by receiving\r\nExtreme Unction. According to Filoteo the noises were so violent that\r\nmany persons were struck deaf. The sun was obscured by smoke and dust,\r\nashes fell in sufficient quantities to destroy the olive plantations of\r\nMessina, and were even carried 300 miles out to sea. The great crater\r\nsuddenly fell in, so as to become level with the Piano del Lago. The\r\nheight of the mountain was thus diminished by 320 feet.\r\n\r\n31. Three new craters opened in November, 1566, on the north-east slope\r\nof the mountain. Quantities of lava were emitted, which flowed towards\r\nLinguaglossa and Randazzo.\r\n\r\n32. A slight eruption, of which we have no details, occurred in 1579.\r\n\r\n33. According to Carrera, an eruption occurred in June, 1603. The\r\nmountain was shaken with earthquakes, and great volumes of smoke and\r\nflame were emitted.\r\n\r\n34. A stream of lava issued from the great crater four years later, and\r\nfilled up the lake which had previously existed in the Piano del Lago.\r\n\r\n35. In February, 1610, lava was emitted from the great crater. It flowed\r\ntowards Aderno, and filled up the bed of the Simeto, a little above the\r\nPonte di Carcaci. A few months later a second stream destroyed a large\r\nportion of the forest Del Pino.\r\n\r\n36. In 1614 several new craters were opened between Randazzo and the\r\ngreat crater on the north side of the mountain. A quantity of lava\r\nissued from them, which united into one stream, and ran for ten miles,\r\ndestroying a great deal of wooded country.\r\n\r\n37. A slight eruption occurred in 1619.\r\n\r\n38. In February, 1633, Nicolosi was partially destroyed by a violent\r\nearthquake; and in the following December earthquakes became frequent on\r\nthe mountain. A new crater opened above the cone called Serrapizzuta,\r\nfive miles from the great crater, and emitted a good deal of lava. A\r\nsecond crater afterwards opened about two miles to the east of the\r\nformer. The eruption lasted off and on for four years: the ejected lava\r\nthen covered a tract eighteen miles in length by two miles in width,\r\nthe thickness sometimes attaining 42 feet. In 1643 a severe earthquake\r\noccurred, which was mainly felt on the west side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n39. In 1646 a new mouth opened on the north-north-east side of the\r\nmountain, five miles from the great crater. The lava flowed towards\r\nCastiglione.\r\n\r\n40. In February, 1651, several new mouths opened on the west side of the\r\nmountain, and poured out vast volumes of lava which threatened to\r\noverwhelm Bronte. In twenty-four hours the lava ran sixteen miles with a\r\nbreadth of four miles.\r\n\r\n41. We have a more detailed account of the eruption of 1669 than of any\r\nprevious outburst. It was observed by many men of different nations; and\r\nwe find accounts of it in our own _Philosophical Transactions_, in\r\nFrench, and of course in Italian. Perhaps the most accurate and complete\r\ndescription is that given by Alfonso Borelli, Professor of Mathematics\r\nin Catania. The eruption was, in every respect, one of the most terrible\r\non record. On the 8th of March the sun was obscured, and a whirlwind\r\nblew over the face of the mountain; at the same time earthquakes\r\ncommenced, and continued to increase in violence for three days, when\r\nNicolosi was converted into a heap of ruins. On the morning of the 11th\r\na fissure nearly twelve miles in length opened in the side of the\r\nmountain, and extended from the Piano di S. Leo to Monte Frumento, a\r\nmile from the summit. The fissure was only six feet wide, but it seemed\r\nto be of unknown depth, and a bright light proceeded from it. Six mouths\r\nopened in a line with the principal fissure; they emitted vast columns\r\nof smoke, accompanied by loud bellowings which could be heard 40 miles\r\noff. Towards the close of the day, a crater opened about a mile below\r\nthe others, and it ejected red hot stones to a considerable distance,\r\nand afterwards sand and ashes which covered the country for a distance\r\nof 60 miles. The new crater soon vomited forth a torrent of lava which\r\npresented a front of two miles, it encircled Monpilieri, and afterwards\r\nflowed towards Belpasso, a town of 8000 inhabitants, which was speedily\r\ndestroyed. Seven mouths of fire opened around the new crater, and in\r\nthree days united with it, forming one large crater 800 feet in\r\ndiameter. The torrent of lava all this time continued to descend, and it\r\ndestroyed the town of Mascalucia on the 23rd of March. On the same day\r\nthe crater cast up great quantities of sand, ashes, and scoriæ, and\r\nformed above itself the great double-coned hill now called Monti Rossi\r\nfrom the red colour of the ashes of which it is mainly composed. On the\r\n25th very violent earthquakes occurred, and the cone of the great\r\ncentral crater was shaken down into the crater for the fifth time since\r\nthe first century A.D. The original current of lava had divided into\r\nthree streams, one of which destroyed S. Pietro, the second\r\nCamporotondo, and the third the lands about Mascalucia, and afterwards\r\nthe village of Misterbianco. Fourteen villages were altogether\r\ndestroyed, and the lava was on its way to Catania. At Albanelli, two\r\nmiles from the city, it undermined a hill covered with cornfields, and\r\ncarried it forward a considerable distance; a vineyard was also seen to\r\nbe floating on its fiery surface. When the lava reached the walls of\r\nCatania it accumulated without progression until it rose to the top of\r\nthe wall, 60 feet in height, and it then fell over in a fiery cascade,\r\nand overwhelmed a part of the city. Another portion of the same stream\r\nthrew down 120 feet of the wall, and flowed into the city. On the 23rd\r\nof April the lava reached the sea, which it entered as a stream 600\r\nyards broad and 40 feet deep. The stream had moved at the rate of\r\nthirteen miles in twenty days, but as it cooled it moved less quickly,\r\nand during the last twenty-three days of its course it only moved two\r\nmiles. On reaching the sea the water of course began to boil violently,\r\nand clouds of steam arose, carrying with them particles of scoriæ.\r\nTowards the end of April the stream on the west side of Catania, which\r\nhad appeared to be consolidated, again burst forth, and flowed into the\r\ngarden of the Benedictine Monastery of S. Niccola, and then branched\r\noff into the city. Attempts were made to build walls to arrest its\r\nprogress. An attempt of another kind was made by a gentleman of Catania,\r\nnamed Pappalardo, who took fifty men with him, having previously\r\nprovided them with skins for protection from the intense heat, and with\r\ncrowbars to effect an opening in the lava. They pierced the solid outer\r\ncrust of solidified lava, and a rivulet of the molten interior\r\nimmediately gushed out, and flowed in the direction of Paterno;\r\nwhereupon 500 men of that town, alarmed for its safety, took up arms,\r\nand caused Pappalardo and his men to desist. The lava did not altogether\r\nstop for four months; and two years after it had ceased to flow it was\r\nfound to be red hot beneath the surface. Even eight years after the\r\neruption quantities of steam escaped from the lava after a shower of\r\nrain. The stones which were ejected from the crater during this eruption\r\nwere often of considerable magnitude, and Borelli calculated that the\r\ndiameter of one which he saw was 50 feet; it was thrown to a distance of\r\na mile, and as it fell it penetrated the earth to a depth of 23 feet.\r\nThe volume of lava emitted during this eruption amounted to many\r\nmillions of cubic feet: Ferrara considers that the length of the stream\r\nwas at least fifteen miles, while its average width was between two and\r\nthree miles, so that it covered at least forty square miles of surface.\r\n\r\nIn a somewhat rare tract,[19] Lord Winchelsea, who was returning to\r\nEngland from Constantinople, and who landed at Catania, gives an account\r\nof what he saw of the eruption. He appears to have been frightened at\r\nthe sight, and took good care to keep in a safe place; hence his letter,\r\nwhich is a short one, is mainly founded on hearsay. However, he says, \"I\r\ncould discern the river of fire to descend the mountain, of a terrible\r\nfiery or red colour, and stones of a paler red to swim thereon, and to\r\nbe as big as an ordinary table.... Of 20,000 persons which inhabited\r\nCatania, 3000 did only remain; all their goods are carried away, the\r\ncannon of brass are removed out of the castle, some great bells taken\r\ndown, the city gates walled up next the fire, and preparations made by\r\nall to abandon the city.\" The noble earl is less happy in his scientific\r\nideas than in his general statement of the facts of which he was an\r\neye-witness; we can only hope that he joined the recently-formed Royal\r\nSociety on his return to England, and listened to Robert Hooke's\r\ndiscourse on fire. In describing the lava, Lord Winchelsea says, \"The\r\ncomposition of this fire, stones, and cinders, are sulphur, nitre,\r\nquicksilver, sal-ammoniac, lead, iron, brass, and all other mettals!\"\r\nTwo other accounts are appended to the above letter; in one of these we\r\nare told that as the lava approached Catania, the various religious\r\nbodies carried their relics in procession, \"followed by great multitudes\r\nof people, some of them mortifying themselves with whips, and other\r\nsigns of penance, with great complaints and cries, expressing their\r\ndreadful expectation of the events of those prodigious fiery\r\ninundations.\" In the midst of all this, news was brought that a large\r\nband of robbers had taken advantage of the general distress, and were\r\nrobbing right and left, and murdering the people: whereupon a troop of\r\nSpanish horse was sent out to protect the city and country, three pair\r\nof gallows were set up, and such as were found robbing were executed\r\nwithout trial by martial law.\r\n\r\n[19] \"A true and exact relation of the late prodigious earthquake and\r\neruption of Mount Ætna or Monte Gibello; as it came in a letter written\r\nto his Majesty from Naples by the Rt. Honble. the Earl of Winchelsea\r\nlate Ambassadour at Constantinople, who in his return from thence\r\nvisiting Catania in the Island of Sicily, was an eye-witness of that\r\ndreadful spectacle.\" Published by Authority. Printed by T. Newcomb in\r\nthe Savoy. 1669.\r\n\r\nAs the lava streams approached the city, the Senate, accompanied by the\r\nBishop and all the clergy, secular and regular, went in procession out\r\nof the city to Monte di S. Sofia with all their relics, etc. There they\r\nerected an altar in view of the burning mountain, and celebrated mass,\r\n\"and used the exorcismes accustomed upon such extraordinary occasions,\r\nall which time the mountain ceased not as before with excessive roaring\r\nto throw up its smoak and flames with extraordinary violence, and\r\nabundance of great stones, which were carried through the air.\"\r\n\r\n42. For a few years after this terrible eruption Etna was quiescent, but\r\nin 1682 a new mouth opened on the east side of the mountain, a little\r\nbelow the summit, and above the Val del Bove. Lava issued from it, and\r\nrushed down the precipices of the Val del Bove as far as the rock of\r\nMusarra.\r\n\r\n43. Six years later a torrent of lava burst from an opening in the great\r\ncone, and flowed into the Val del Bove for a distance of three miles.\r\n\r\n44. In the following year lava was emitted from a mouth in the Val del\r\nBove, and it descended for about ten miles, destroying everything in its\r\ncourse, until it reached a little valley near Macchia.\r\n\r\n45. Early in January 1693, clouds of black smoke were poured from the\r\ngreat crater, and loud noises resembling the discharge of artillery were\r\nheard. A violent earthquake succeeded, and Catania was shaken to the\r\nground, burying 18,000 of its inhabitants in the ruins. It is said that\r\nin all fifty towns were destroyed in Sicily, together with from 60,000\r\nto 100,000 inhabitants. Lava was emitted from the crater, which was\r\nlowered by the eruption.\r\n\r\n46. In the following year Etna again entered into eruption, ejecting\r\nlarge quantities of ashes, some of which were carried as far as Malta.\r\n\r\n47. In March 1702, three mouths opened in the Contrada del Trifoglietto,\r\nnear the head of the Val del Bove. Lava was emitted from them, which\r\nflowed into the Valley of Calanna.\r\n\r\n48. Towards the end of 1723 loud bellowings issued from the mountain;\r\nearthquakes occurred, and a torrent of lava issued from the crater,\r\nwhich flowed towards Bronte, through the Bosco di Bronte.\r\n\r\n49. A small lava stream issued from the crater in 1732, and descended\r\nthe western slope of the mountain, but without producing any damage.\r\n\r\n50. In October 1735, the usual noises which presage an eruption were\r\nheard, earthquakes followed, and a little later the crater emitted\r\nflames and red-hot stones. Lava also issued from it, and the stream\r\ndivided into three branches, one of which flowed towards Bronte, a\r\nsecond towards Linguaglossa, and a third towards Mascali; but they did\r\nnot get beyond the upper regions of the mountain.\r\n\r\n51. In 1744 the mountain threw out great quantities of ashes, but no\r\nlava.\r\n\r\n52. In 1747 a quantity of lava flowed from the great crater into the Val\r\ndel Bove, and the height of the cone was considerably increased during\r\nthe eruption.\r\n\r\n53. Early in the year 1755, Etna began to show signs of disturbance; a\r\ngreat column of black smoke issued from the crater, from which forked\r\nlightning was frequently emitted. Loud detonations were heard, and two\r\nstreams of lava issued from the crater. A new mouth opened near the\r\nRocca di Musarra in the Val del Bove, four miles from the summit, and a\r\nquantity of lava was ejected from it. An extraordinary flood of water\r\ndescended from the Val del Bove, carrying all before it, and strewing\r\nits path, with huge blocks. Recupero estimated the volume of water as\r\n16,000,000 cubic feet, probably a greater amount than could be furnished\r\nby the melting of all the winter's snow on the mountain. It formed a\r\nchannel two miles broad, and, in some places, thirty-four feet deep, and\r\nit flowed at the rate of a mile in a minute and a half during the first\r\ntwelve miles of its course. Lyell considers the flood was probably\r\nproduced by the melting, not only of the winter's snow, but also of\r\nolder layers of ice, which were suddenly melted by the permeation of hot\r\nsteam and lava, and which had been previously preserved from melting by\r\na deposit of sand and ashes, as in the case of the ancient glacier found\r\nnear the summit of the mountain in 1828. In November 1758, a smart shock\r\nof earthquake caused the cone of the great crater to fall in, but no\r\neruption occurred at the time.\r\n\r\n54. Great quantities of ashes, and some small streams of lava, were\r\nemitted from the crater in 1759, a little later the cone, which had been\r\nagain raised by the eruption, gave way, and the greater part of it fell\r\ninto the crater. Two parts of it however were left standing.\r\n\r\n55. Severe shocks of earthquakes were felt on the east side of the\r\nmountain in 1763, and a new mouth opened in the Bosco di Bronte, ten\r\nmiles from the town, between Monte Rosso and Monte Lepre. Four other\r\nmouths were afterwards opened in a line; they threw up quantities of\r\nscoriæ and ashes, and afterwards lava. In the middle of June several\r\nmouths opened on the south side of the mountain, and a fissure 2000 feet\r\nlong opened downwards in a southerly direction. The lava divided into\r\ntwo branches, the larger of which was ten miles long and 250 feet wide,\r\nwith a depth of 25 feet.\r\n\r\n56. Several new mouths opened in the spring of 1766, and ejected large\r\nvolumes of ashes, also streams of lava, which flowed in the direction of\r\nNicolosi and Pedara. The Canon Recupero, one of the historians of Etna,\r\nwitnessed this eruption, and narrowly escaped being destroyed. He had\r\nascended a small hill 50 feet high, of ancient volcanic matter, in order\r\nto witness the approach of the lava stream which was slowly advancing\r\nwith a front of two miles and a half. Suddenly two small streams\r\ndetached themselves from the main stream, and ran rapidly towards the\r\nhill. Recupero and his guide at once hastened to descend, and had\r\nbarely escaped when they saw the hill surrounded by lava, and in a few\r\nminutes it was melted down and sank into the molten mass.\r\n\r\n57. In the early part of 1780, earthquakes were felt all over Sicily,\r\nand on the 18th of May a fissure opened on the south-west side of the\r\nmountain, and extended from the base of the great crater for seven\r\nmiles, terminating in a new mouth from which a stream of lava emanated.\r\nThis encountered the cone of Palmintelli in its course, and separated\r\ninto two branches, each of which was 400 feet wide. Other mouths opened\r\nlater in the year, and emitted large quantities of lava, which\r\ndevastated the country of Montemazzo.\r\n\r\n58. In 1781 the volcano emitted a quantity of lava which flowed into the\r\nVal del Bove. Clouds of grey ashes were also ejected. At the\r\ncommencement of the great Calabrian earthquake of 1783, Etna ejected\r\nlarge quantities of smoke, but it was otherwise quiescent.\r\n\r\n59. In the middle of 1787 lava burst from the great crater, which also\r\ndischarged quantities of sand, scoriæ, and red-hot ashes. Large heated\r\nmasses of rock were ejected to a great height, and subterranean\r\nbellowings were heard by the dwellers on the mountain.\r\n\r\n60. Five years afterwards a fresh outburst occurred, earthquakes were\r\nprevalent, and vast volumes of smoke bore to seaward, and seemed to\r\nbridge the sea between Sicily and Africa. A torrent of lava flowed\r\ntowards Aderno, and a second flowed into the Val del Bove as far as\r\nZoccolaro. A pit called _La Cisterna_, 40 feet in diameter, opened in\r\nthe Piano del Lago, near the great cone, and ejected smoke and masses of\r\nold lava saturated with water. Several mouths opened below the crater,\r\nand the country round about Zaffarana was desolated. The Abate Ferrara,\r\nthe author of the _Descrizione dell' Etna_, witnessed this eruption: \"I\r\nshall never forget,\" he writes, \"that this last mouth opened precisely\r\non the spot where, the day before, I had made my meal with a shepherd.\r\nOn my return next day he related how, after a stunning explosion, the\r\nrocks on which we had sat together were blown into the air, and a mouth\r\nopened, discharging a flood of fire, which, rushing down with the\r\nrapidity of water, hardly gave him time to make his escape.\"\r\n\r\n61. In 1797 a slight eruption occurred, and the great crater threw out\r\nashes and sand, but no lava. Earthquakes were frequent.\r\n\r\n62. In the following year lava was emitted, and severe earthquakes\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n63. The eruptions continued during 1799.\r\n\r\n64. In February 1800 loud explosions were heard by the dwellers on the\r\nmountain, and columns of fire issued from the crater, accompanied by\r\nforked lightning. This was succeeded by a discharge of hot ashes and\r\nscoriæ, which, falling on the snows accumulated near the summit of the\r\nmountain, produced devastating floods of water.\r\n\r\n65. In November 1802 a new mouth opened near the Rocca di Musarra in the\r\nVal del Bove, which emitted a copious stream of lava. In a day and a\r\nhalf the lava had run twelve miles.\r\n\r\n66. In 1805 the great crater was in a state of eruption, and a cone was\r\nthrown up within it to a height of 1,050 feet.\r\n\r\n67. In 1808 the mountain again became active, and fire and smoke were\r\nemitted from the crater.\r\n\r\n68. In March 1809, no less than twenty-one mouths of fire opened in the\r\ndirection of Castiglione. They ejected volumes of smoke, large\r\nquantities of scoriæ and ashes, and afterwards lava, which, uniting into\r\none torrent, flowed with a front of 450 feet for 8 miles. Fissures were\r\nformed in the earth, and loud explosions constantly occurred within the\r\ngreat crater; a small cone was thrown up.\r\n\r\n69. Two years afterwards more than thirty mouths opened in a line\r\nrunning eastwards for five miles. They ejected jets of fire accompanied\r\nby much smoke. The eruptions soon diminished in the higher mouths, and\r\nbecame more and more violent in the lower mouths, until the eruption\r\ncentred in the lowest one called S. Simone, near the head of the Val del\r\nBove. From this, great black clouds, having a lustre like that of black\r\nwool, issued, and afterwards quantities of lava, which formed a stream\r\na mile wide, and eight miles long. It flowed nearly as far as the\r\nvillage of Milo. Frequent earthquakes accompanied this outburst, and\r\nthey continued in various parts of the island for the following five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n70. In 1819 five new mouths of fire opened near the scene of the\r\neruption of 1811; three of these united into one large crater, and\r\npoured forth a quantity of lava into the Val del Bove. The lava flowed\r\nuntil it reached a nearly perpendicular precipice at the bend of the\r\nvalley of Calanna, over which it fell in a cascade, and, being hardened\r\nby its descent, it was forced against the sides of the tufaceous rock at\r\nthe bottom, so as to produce an extraordinary amount of abrasion,\r\naccompanied by clouds of dust, worn off by the friction. Mr. Scrope\r\nobserved that the lava flowed at the rate of about a yard an hour, nine\r\nmonths after its emission.\r\n\r\n71. A slight eruption occurred in 1831 from the great crater, which\r\nthrew out lava on its northern side.\r\n\r\n72. In October of the following year a violent eruption occurred. A new\r\ncrater was formed in the Val del Serbo, above Bronte and three miles\r\nfrom the summit. Seven mouths afterwards opened, three miles below the\r\nfirst. From one of these lava was emitted, which flowed to within a mile\r\nand a half of Bronte. The stream was a mile and a half broad, and 40\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\n73. A slight eruption occurred in 1838, when a small quantity of lava\r\nwas poured from the great crater into the Val del Bove.\r\n\r\n74. Four years later the crater discharged ashes and scoriæ, and lava\r\nburst from the cone 300 feet from the summit. It flowed into the Val del\r\nBove, in a stream 600 feet wide, and it came to a standstill ten miles\r\nfrom the summit.\r\n\r\n75. Near the end of the following year, fifteen mouths of fire opened\r\nnear the crater of 1832, at a height of 7000 feet above the sea. They\r\nbegan by discharging scoriæ and sand, and afterwards lava, which divided\r\ninto three streams, the two outer ones soon came to a standstill, while\r\nthe central stream continued to flow at the rapid rate of 180 feet a\r\nminute, the descent being an angle of 25°. The heat at a distance of 120\r\nfeet from the current was 90° F. A new crater opened just above Bronte,\r\nand discharged lava which threatened the town, but it fortunately\r\nencountered Monte Vittoria and was diverted into another course. While a\r\nnumber of the inhabitants of Bronte were watching the progress of the\r\nlava, the front of the stream was suddenly blown out as by an explosion\r\nof gunpowder; in an instant red-hot masses were hurled in every\r\ndirection; and a cloud of vapour enveloped everything. Thirty-six\r\npersons were killed on the spot, and twenty survived but a few hours.\r\nThe great crater showed signs of disturbance, by emitting dense volumes\r\nof smoke, and loud bellowings, also quantities of volcanic dust\r\nsaturated with hydrochloric acid, which destroyed the vegetation\r\nwherever it fell.\r\n\r\n76. A very violent eruption which lasted more than nine months,\r\ncommenced on the 21st of August, 1852. It was first witnessed by a party\r\nof six English tourists, who were ascending the mountain from Nicolosi\r\nin order to see the sunrise from the summit. As they approached the Casa\r\nInglesi the crater commenced to give forth ashes and flames of fire. In\r\na narrow defile they were met by a violent hurricane, which overthrew\r\nboth the mules and their riders, and urged them towards the precipices\r\nof the Val del Bove. They sheltered themselves beneath some masses of\r\nlava, when suddenly an earthquake shook the mountain, and their mules in\r\nterror fled away. They returned on foot towards daylight to Nicolosi,\r\nfortunately without having sustained injury. In the course of the night\r\nmany _bocche del fuoco_ opened in that part of the Val del Bove called\r\nthe Balzo di Trifoglietto, and a great fissure opened at the base of the\r\nGiannicola Grande, and a crater was thrown up from which for seventeen\r\ndays showers of sand and scoriæ were ejected. During the next day a\r\nquantity of lava flowed down the Val del Bove, branching off so that one\r\nstream advanced to the foot of Monte Finocchio, and the other to Monte\r\nCalanna. Afterwards it flowed towards Zaffarana, and devastated a large\r\ntract of woody region. Four days later a second crater was formed near\r\nthe first, from which lava was emitted together with sand and scoriæ,\r\nwhich caused cones to rise around the craters. The lava moved but\r\nslowly, and towards the end of August it came to a stand, only a quarter\r\nof a mile from Zaffarana: on the second of September, Gemellaro ascended\r\nMonte Finocchio in the Val del Bove in order to witness the outburst. He\r\nstates that the hill was violently agitated, like a ship at sea. The\r\nsurface of the Val del Bove appeared like a molten lake; scoriæ were\r\nthrown up from the craters to a great height, and loud explosions were\r\nheard at frequent intervals. The eruption continued to increase in\r\nviolence. On October 6th two new mouths opened in the Val del Bove,\r\nemitting lava which flowed towards the Valley of Calanna, and fell over\r\nthe Salto della Giumenta, a precipice nearly 200 feet deep. The noise\r\nwhich it produced was like that of the clash of metallic masses. The\r\neruption continued with abated violence during the early months of 1853,\r\nand it did not finally cease till May 27. The entire mass of lava\r\nejected is estimated to be equal to an area six miles long by two miles\r\nbroad, with an average depth of about twelve feet.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to M. Antonin Moris of Palermo for the following account\r\nof the eruption of 1852:\r\n\r\nThe eruption of 1852 commenced on the 21st of August. The earthquakes,\r\nthe jets of flame from the great crater, and the subterranean rumblings\r\nwhich usually precede an eruption, did not herald the approach of this\r\none. An English family, who were then making the ascent of the mountain,\r\ntogether with a poor shepherd of Riposto, were the only witnesses of the\r\nfirst outburst. The latter was asleep in the midst of his flocks, and\r\nwas awakened by violent shakings of the ground; he fled in haste, and\r\nsome seconds afterwards the earth opened with a loud noise, vomiting a\r\nterrible column of fire, at the very spot which he had just abandoned.\r\nAn enormous crevasse opened on the north side of Trifoglietto in the\r\ndirection of the great crater. On its summit near the opening called the\r\nPiccolo Teatro, several openings were produced at the very first, but\r\nthey only emitted feeble currents of lava. All the force of the eruption\r\nwas concentrated at the foot of the escarpment of the Serra di\r\nGiannicola, 4 kilometres, (2-1/2 miles) from the summit of Etna. To the\r\nwest of, and somewhat above the principal crater, a second one was\r\nformed, but its activity was of short duration. The liquid lava issued\r\nwith such violence that in 24 hours it had reached the base of Monte\r\nCalanna, a distance of 3 kilometres, (nearly 2 miles). After surrounding\r\nthis hill, it divided into two currents, one of which ran towards\r\nZaffarana, and the other towards Milo. At a distance they seemed to\r\npresent a united front of 2 kilometres, (1-1/4 mile), which threatened\r\nto destroy all the villages below. The Val del Bove was already\r\nentirely overrun; Isoletta dei Zappinelli in the midst of the lavas of\r\n1811 and 1819 was overwhelmed; the valley of Calanna was buried under\r\nthe fire with lava, when on the 28th of August the lava hurled itself\r\ninto the narrow passage of the Portella di Calanna. A frightful cascade\r\nof lava was then seen to precipitate itself from a height of 60 metres,\r\nwith a harsh metallic noise, accompanied by loud cracking. Zaffarana was\r\non the eve of total ruin; the fire had taken the direction of the ravine\r\nwhich terminates there, when suddenly, in the beginning of September,\r\nthe devastating stream stayed its march against the ill-fated district.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary that which had taken the direction of Milo, reinforced\r\nby a new current on the 10th of September, destroyed the hamlet of\r\nCaselle del Milo; and afterwards divided itself into two branches, which\r\nleft the village of Caselle in safety between them.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of La Macchia and Giarre gave themselves up for lost;\r\nfor it seemed that the lava would be obliged to follow the valley of\r\nSanta Maria della Strada; happily, however, from the 20th of September\r\nonward, it ceased to advance perceptibly. The eruption did not totally\r\nsubside till March 1853; but the lava-flows did no more than travel by\r\nthe side, or on the top of the older, without extending beyond them.\r\n\r\nThe crater of 1852 was called the Centenario, from its having been\r\nformed at the time of the centenary of the fête of S. Agatha. Santiago,\r\nin the island of Cuba, was destroyed by an earthquake on the very day of\r\nthe eruption.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of the eruption, only one explosion proceeded\r\nfrom the great crater of Etna. By it an enormous column of ashes and\r\nscoriæ was cast into the air.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September white ashes were seen on the summit, which at a\r\ndistance appeared like snow. When pressed together by the hand they took\r\nthe consistence of clay, but they hardened in the fire, and could then\r\nbe reduced to powder. They have been considered to be the _debris_ of\r\nfelspathic rocks, disintegrated by the heat of the lava, and blown out\r\nby the expansive power of disengaged gas.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of 1852 was one of the grandest of the recorded eruptions\r\nof Etna. More than 2,000,000,000 cubic feet of red hot lava was spread\r\nover three square miles. This eruption was minutely described by Carlo\r\nGemellaro, in a memoir entitled, \"_Breve ragguaglio della eruzione\r\ndell' Etna del 21 Agosto, 1852_.\"\r\n\r\n77. In October 1864, frequent shocks of earthquakes were felt by the\r\ndwellers on Etna. In January clouds of smoke were emitted by the great\r\ncrater, and roaring sounds were heard. On the night of the 30th a\r\nviolent shock was felt on the north-east side of the mountain, and a\r\nmouth opened below Monte Frumento, from which lava was ejected. It\r\nflowed at a rate of about a mile a day, and ultimately divided into two\r\nstreams. By March 10th the new mouths of fire had increased to seven in\r\nnumber, and they were all situated along a line stretching down from the\r\nsummit. The three upper craters gave forth loud detonations three or\r\nfour times a minute. Professor Orazio Silvestri has devoted a quarto of\r\n267 pages to an account of _I Fenomeni Vulcanici presentati dall'Etna\r\nnel 1863-64-65-66_.\r\n\r\n78. In August 1874 the inhabitants of the towns situated on the north,\r\nwest, and east sides of the mountain, were awakened by loud subterranean\r\nrumblings. Soon afterwards a formidable column of black smoke issued\r\nfrom the crater, accompanied by sand, scoriæ, and ignited matter\r\n(_infuocata materia_). Severe shocks of earthquake were felt, the centre\r\nof impulsion being apparently situated on the northern flank of the\r\nmountain, at a height of 2450 metres above the level of the sea. Some\r\nsmall _bocche eruttive_ opened near the great crater, and ejected lava,\r\nbut the quantity was comparatively small, and but little damage was\r\ndone. An account of this eruption was given by Silvestri in 1874, in a\r\nsmall pamphlet entitled, _Notizie sulla eruzione dell' Etna del 29\r\nAgosto, 1874_. Since 1874 the mountain has been in a quiescent state.\r\nThe centre of disturbance was at an elevation of 2450 metres (7600 feet)\r\nabove the sea, on the north side of the crater, and between the minor\r\ncones known as the _Fratelli Pii_ and _Monte Grigio_. A new crater,\r\nhaving an elliptical contour, and a diameter of about 100 metres, was\r\nformed at this point. It is composed of a prehistoric grey labradorite,\r\nand of doleritic lava. Downwards from the main crater, in the direction\r\nof Monte di Mojo, a long fissure extended for 400 metres, and along the\r\nline of this fissure no less than _thirty-five_ minor cones opened, with\r\ncraters of from thirty to three metres in diameter. The stream of lava\r\nejected from the various _boccarelle_ was 400 metres long, 80 wide, and\r\n2 metres in thickness, and the bulk of volcanic material brought to the\r\nsurface, including the principal cone and its thirty-five subordinates\r\nand their ejectamenta, was calculated to amount to 1,351,000 cubic\r\nmetres. The lava is of an augitic character, and magnetic; it possesses\r\na specific gravity of 2·3636 at 25° C.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the account of the foregoing eruptions that there\r\nis a great similarity in the character of the eruptions of Etna.\r\nEarthquakes presage the outburst; loud explosions follow, rifts and\r\n_bocche del fuoco_ open in the sides of the mountain; smoke, sand,\r\nashes, and scoriæ are discharged, the action localises itself in one or\r\nmore craters, cinders are thrown up, and accumulate around the crater\r\nand cone, ultimately lava rises, and frequently breaks down one side of\r\nthe cone, where the resistance is least. Then the eruption is at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nSmyth says, \"The symptoms which precede an eruption are generally\r\nirregular clouds of smoke, ferilli, or volcanic lightnings, hollow\r\nintonations, and local earthquakes that often alarm the surrounding\r\ncountry as far as Messina, and have given the whole province the name of\r\nVal Demone, as being the abode of infernal spirits. These agitations\r\nincrease until the vast cauldron becomes surcharged with the fused\r\nminerals, when, if the convulsion is not sufficiently powerful to force\r\nthem from the great crater (which, from its great altitude and the\r\nweight of the candent matter, requires an uncommon effort), they explode\r\nthrough that part of the side which offers the least resistance with a\r\ngrand and terrific effect, throwing red-hot stones and flakes of fire to\r\nan incredible height, and spreading ignited cinders and ashes in every\r\ndirection.\" After the eruption of ashes, lava frequently follows,\r\nsometimes rising to the top of the cone of cinders, at others breaching\r\nit on the least resisting side. When the lava has reached the base of\r\nthe cone, it begins to flow down the mountain, and being then in a very\r\nfluid state, it moves with great velocity. As it cools the sides and\r\nsurface begin to harden, its velocity decreases, and in the course of a\r\nfew days it only moves a few yards in an hour. The internal portions,\r\nhowever, part slowly with their heat, and months after the eruption,\r\nclouds of steam arise from the black and externally cold lava beds after\r\nrain, which, having penetrated through the cracks, has found its way to\r\nthe heated mass within.\r\n\r\nOf the seventy-eight eruptions described above, it will be noticed that\r\nnot more than nineteen have been of extreme violence, while the majority\r\nhave been of a slight and comparatively harmless character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geological Map of Etna]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY OF THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n    Elie de Beaumont's classification of rocks of Etna.--Hoffman's\r\n    geological map.--Lyell's researches.--The period of earliest\r\n    eruption.--The Val del Bove.--Two craters of eruption.--Antiquity of\r\n    Etna.--The lavas of Etna.--Labradorite.--Augite.--Olivine.--\r\n    Analcime.--Titaniferous iron.--Mr. Rutley's examination of Etna\r\n    lavas under the microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion of geologists is divided as to the manner in which a volcano\r\nis first formed. Some hold that the volcanic forces have upraised the\r\nrocks from beneath, and at last finding vent have scattered the lighter\r\nportions of such rocks into the air, and have poured out lava through\r\nthe rent masses, thus forming a _crater of elevation_. Others maintain\r\nthat the volcanic products are ejected from an aperture or fissure\r\nalready existing in rocks previously formed, and that the accumulation\r\nof these products around the vent forms the mass of the volcano and the\r\n_crater of eruption_. Lyell favours the latter view; Von Buch, Dufrénoy,\r\nand Elie de Beaumont the former.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Elie de Beaumont, Etna is an irregular crater of\r\nelevation. The original deposits were nearly horizontal, and lavas were\r\npoured through fissures in these, and accumulated at first in layers;\r\nafterwards the whole mass was upheaved and a crater formed.[20] The\r\nupheaving force does not appear to have acted at one point, but along a\r\nline traversing the Val del Bove. The latter he refers to a subsidence\r\nof a portion of the mountain. He divides the rocks of Etna into six\r\norders: 1. The lowest basis of the mountain would appear to consist of\r\ngranite, because masses of that rock have from time to time been\r\nejected. 2. Calcareous and arenaceous rocks, of which the mountains\r\nsurrounding Etna are composed, and which appear capped with lava near\r\nBronte and elsewhere. 3. Basaltic rocks, which are met with near Motta\r\nS. Anastasia, Paterno, Licodia, and Aderno, and in the Isole de'Ciclopi.\r\n4. Rolled pebbles, which form a range of slightly rising ground between\r\nthe first slopes of Etna on the southern side and the plain of Catania.\r\n(Lyell speaks of this rising ground as consisting of \"argillaceous and\r\nsandy beds with marine shells, nearly all of living Mediterranean\r\nspecies, and with associated and contemporaneous volcanic rocks.\") 5.\r\nAncient lavas forming the escarpments around the Val del Bove; and 6th,\r\nModern lavas. He considers that the fissures which abound on Etna are\r\nshifts or faults produced by dislocation, and that the minor cones are\r\npoints along such fissures from which ashes and lava have been ejected.\r\nHe admits the existence of two cones. The geological map of Etna\r\nprepared by M. Elie de Beaumont to accompany his memoir can scarcely be\r\nregarded as a great addition to our knowledge of the mountain. For\r\nalthough in the main points it is correct, so many details have been\r\nomitted that the map must be considered to have now been quite\r\nsuperseded by those of Von Waltershausen and Friedrich Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n[20] \"Récherches sur la structure et sur l'origine du Mont Etna.\" 1836.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient geological map of the mountain is without doubt that\r\nof Hoffmann, given in the _Vulkanen Atlas_ of Dr. Von Leonhard; and here\r\nreproduced. Von Waltershausen's geological map has been the foundation\r\nof all others which have subsequently appeared. It is a marvel of\r\naccurate work, and patient industry. The form however is inconvenient,\r\nas it nowhere appears as a whole, but in separate portions, which are\r\nscattered through the folio sheets of the very expensive _Atlas des\r\nAetna_. It is accurate, and at the same time very clear and\r\nintelligible. By reference to the map it will be seen that from Capo di\r\nSchiso westward, to near Paterno, Etna is surrounded by sandstone hills;\r\nat the south we have recent clays, and, at intervals, chalk. A large\r\ntriangular space having the two angles at its base, respectively near\r\nMaletto and Aderno, and its apex at the great crater, is covered with\r\nnew lava; while around Nicolosi there is volcanic sand. At the Isole\r\nde'Ciclopi, Motta S. Anastasia, and a few other places, basalt is seen;\r\non each side of the Val del Bove, dolerite; and near Misterbianco and\r\nPiedemonte, small deposits of clay slate. The great mass of the surface\r\nof the mountain, not specially mentioned above, is volcanic tuff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the Val del Bove, to illustrate the theory of a\r\ndouble axis of eruption. (_Lyell_).]\r\n\r\nAmong the more important and recent additions to our knowledge of the\r\ngeology of Etna may be mentioned Lyell's paper on the subject,\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society in 1858, the matter of which is\r\nincorporated in a lengthy chapter on Etna in the \"Principles of\r\nGeology.\" Lyell visited the mountain in 1828, 1857, and 1858, and he\r\nthen collected together a great number of personal observations; he also\r\nmade use of the maps and plans of Von Waltershausen, and he has analysed\r\nthe views of Elie de Beaumont and other writers. He alludes at the\r\noutset to the numerous minor cones of Etna produced by lateral eruption,\r\nand points out the fact that they are gradually obliterated by the lava\r\ndescending from the upper part of the mountain, which flows around them\r\nand heightens the ground on which they stand. In this way the crater of\r\nMonte Nocilla is now level with the plain, and the crater of Monte\r\nCapreolo was nearly filled by a lava stream in 1669. Thus without\r\ndoubt beneath the sloping sides of Etna a multitude of obliterated\r\nmonticules exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ideal section of Mount Etna]\r\n\r\nThe strata which surround Mount Etna on the south are of Newer Pliocene\r\ndate, and contain shells which are nearly all of species still living in\r\nthe Mediterranean. Out of sixty-five species collected by Lyell in 1828,\r\nsixty-one were found to belong to species still common in the\r\nMediterranean. These strata are about the age of the Norwich crag; and\r\nthe oldest eruptions of Etna must have taken place during the glacial\r\nperiod, but before the period of greatest cold in Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore visiting Etna, Lyell had been told by Dr. Buckland that in his\r\nopinion the Val del Bove was the most interesting part of Etna,\r\naccordingly he specially and minutely examined that part of the\r\nmountain. This vast valley is situated on the eastern flanks of the\r\nmountain, and it commences near the base of the cone, stretching for\r\nnearly five miles downwards. It is a large oval basin formed in the side\r\nof the mountain, and surrounded by vast precipices, some of which at the\r\nhead of the valley are between three and four thousand feet in height.\r\nThe surface is covered with lava of various dates, and several minor\r\ncones, notably those of 1852, are within its boundaries. The abrupt\r\nprecipices reveal the presence of a large number of vertical dikes,\r\nradiating from a point within the valley, some of them, according to Von\r\nWaltershausen, being of ancient greenstone. Other dikes of more modern\r\ndoleritic lava radiate from the present crater. From the slope of the\r\nbeds in the Val del Bove, Lyell and Von Waltershausen have independently\r\ninferred that there was once a second great centre of eruption in the\r\nVal del Bove between the Sierra Giannicola, and Zoccolaro (_vide_ the\r\nFigure on p. 117). The axis of eruption passing through this point Lyell\r\ncalls the _Axis of Trifoglietto_; while he distinguishes the present\r\ncentre of eruption as the _Axis of Mongibello_. These centres probably\r\nexisted simultaneously, but were unequal as regards eruptive violence;\r\nthe crater of Mongibello was the more active of the two, and eventually\r\noverwhelmed the crater of Trifoglietto with its products, by which means\r\nthe whole mountain became a fairly symmetrical cone, having the crater\r\nof Mongibello at its apex (_vide_ the Figures on pp. 119 and 121).\r\nSubsequently the Val del Bove was formed, probably by some paroxysmal\r\nexplosion, caused by pent-up gases escaping from fissures. Possibly also\r\nsubsidence may have occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile of Etna]\r\n\r\nWe must then in the first place think of Etna as a submarine volcano\r\nof the Newer Pliocene age; when it reached the surface it increased\r\nrapidly in bulk by pouring out scoriæ and lava from its two centres\r\nof eruption--the centre of Mongibello, and the centre of\r\nTrifoglietto,--general upheaval of the surrounding district followed,\r\nand ultimately the crater of Trifoglietto was obliterated by the\r\ndischarges from the crater of Mongibello. Afterwards the Val del Bove\r\nwas blown out by sudden eruptive force from beneath, and the mountain\r\nassumed its present aspect. Then the historical eruptions commenced,\r\nand of these we have given an account in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious method of obtaining some idea as to the age of Etna, is\r\nto ascertain the thickness of matter added during the historical period\r\nto the sides of the mountain, and to compare this with the thickness of\r\nthe beds of ancient lava and scoriæ exposed at the abrupt precipices of\r\nthe Val del Bove. There is reason for believing, however, that none of\r\nthe ancient lavas equalled in volume the lava streams of 1809 and 1852,\r\nand the question is much complicated by other considerations. Lyell\r\ncompares the growth of a volcano to that of an exogenous tree, which\r\nincreases both in bulk and height by the external application of\r\nligneous matter. Branches which shoot out from the trunk, first pierce\r\nthe bark and proceed outwards, but if they die or are broken off they\r\nbecome inclosed in the body of the tree, forming knots in the wood.\r\nSimilarly the volcano consists of a series of conical masses placed one\r\nabove the other, while the minor cones, corresponding to the branches of\r\nthe tree, first project, and then become buried again, as successive\r\nlayers of lava flow around them. But volcanic action is very\r\nintermittent, the layers of lava and scoriæ do not accumulate evenly and\r\nregularly like the layers of a tree. A violent paroxysmal outbreak may\r\nbe succeeded by centuries of quiescence, or by a number of ordinary\r\neruptions; or, again, several paroxysmal outbreaks may occur in\r\nsuccession. Moreover, each conical envelope of the mountain is made up\r\nof a number of distinct currents of lava, and showers of scoriæ. \"Yet we\r\ncannot fail to form the most exalted conception of the antiquity of this\r\nmountain, when we consider that its base is about 90 miles in\r\ncircumference; so that it would require ninety flows of lava, each a\r\nmile in breadth at their termination, to raise the present foot of the\r\nvolcano as much as the average height of one lava current.\" If all the\r\nminor cones now visible on Etna could be removed, with all the lava and\r\nscoriæ which have ever proceeded from them, the mountain would appear\r\nscarcely perceptibly smaller. Other cones would reveal themselves\r\nbeneath those now existing. Since the time when, in the Newer Pliocene\r\nperiod, the foundations of Etna were laid in the sea, it is quite\r\nimpossible even to hint at the number of hundreds of thousands of years\r\nwhich have elapsed.\r\n\r\nWe collected specimens of lava from various points around and upon the\r\nmountain. They presented a wonderful similarity of structure, and a\r\nmineralogist to whom they were shown remarked that they might almost\r\nall have come from the same crater, at the same time. A specimen of the\r\nlava of 1535 found near Borello, was ground by a lapidary until it was\r\nsufficiently transparent to be examined under the microscope by\r\npolarised light. It was found to contain good crystals of augite and\r\nolivine, well striated labradorite, and titaniferous iron ore.\r\n\r\nElie de Beaumont affirms that the lavas of Etna consist of labradorite,\r\npyroxene (augite), peridot (olivine), and titaniferous iron. Rose was\r\nthe first to prove that the lavas of Etna do not contain ordinary\r\nfelspar (or potash felspar), but labradorite (or lime felspar.)\r\n(_Annales des Mines_, 3 serie, t. viii., p. 3.) Elie de Beaumont\r\ndetached a quantity of white crystals from the interior of a lava found\r\nbetween Giarre and Aci Reale; these were analysed by M. Auguste Laurent\r\nwith the following results in 100 parts:--\r\n\r\n    Silica            47·9\r\n    Alumina           34·0\r\n    Oxide of Iron      2·4\r\n    Soda (Na{2}O)      5·1\r\n    Potash (K{2}O)      ·9\r\n    Lime               9·5\r\n    Magnesia            ·2\r\n                     -----\r\n                     100·0\r\n\r\nVon Waltershausen gives the following as the composition of two\r\nspecimens of Labradorite from Etna:--\r\n\r\n                            I.

The word is\r\nderived from ~analkis~ weak, in allusion to the weak electric\r\npower which the mineral acquires when heated or rubbed. Dana prefers the\r\nterm _analcite_. Specimens from the Cyclops Islands have been analysed\r\nby Von Waltershausen and Rammelsberg, with the following results:--\r\n\r\n                             I.        II.

It\r\nhas been remarked that no area of equal size on the face of the globe\r\nfurnishes so many different species of minerals as Vesuvius and its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. Out of the 380 species of simple minerals\r\nenumerated by Hauy, no less than 82 had been found on and around\r\nVesuvius, as long ago as 1828, and many have been since found.\r\n\r\nOf other common products of Etna, there are sulphur in various forms,\r\nsulphurous acid gas, ammonia salts, hydrochloric acid gas, and steam. A\r\ncurious white mass, which we found near the summit, proved to be the\r\nresult of the decomposition of lava by hot acid vapours. In the\r\ndifferent lavas, the crystals of labradorite, and of olivine, vary in\r\nsize considerably. Magnetic oxide of iron is very visible in thin\r\nslices of the lavas when placed under the microscope; and iron appears\r\nto be a constant constituent in nearly all the products of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few months Prof. Silvestri has detected a mineral oil in\r\nthe cavities of a prehistoric doleritic lava found near Paterno.[21] The\r\nlava is in close contiguity to the clay deposits of a mud volcano, and\r\nwhen examined under the microscope is seen to consist mainly of augite,\r\ntogether with olivine and transparent crystals of labradorite. It\r\ncontains numerous cavities coated with arragonite, and filled with a\r\nmineral oil which constitutes about one per cent of the whole weight of\r\nthe lava. It was taken from the lava at a temperature of 24° C., (75·2°\r\nF.), and solidified at 17° C. (62·6° F.) to a yellowish green mass,\r\nwhich on analysis gave the following percentage composition:--\r\n\r\n    Liquid hydrocarbons boiling at 79° C.            = 17·97\r\n    Hydrocarbons solidifying below 0° C., boiling }\r\n      between 280° and 400° C.                    }  = 31·95\r\n    Paraffine melting between 52° and 57° C.         = 42·79\r\n    Asphalt containing 12 per cent of ash            =  2·90\r\n    Sulphur                                          =  4·32\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                       99·93\r\n\r\n[21] \"Atti Accademia Gioenia,\" serie iii., vol. xii.\r\n\r\nProf. Silvestri has recently made some interesting determinations of the\r\nspecific gravity and chemical composition of the different products of\r\nEtna.

He considers that they are Plagioclase-basalts, and\r\noccasionally Olivine-basalts; and that they consist of Plagioclase,\r\nAugite, Olivine, Magnetite, Titaniferous iron, and a residuum of glass.\r\n\r\nNear the summit of the great crater I found a mass of perfectly white,\r\nvesicular, and very friable substance, somewhat pumiceous in appearance.\r\nIt proved to be a decomposed lava, and was found elsewhere on the sides\r\nof the crater. Mr. Rutley examined a section of it, and reports: \"Under\r\nthe microscope a tolerably thin section shows the outlines of felspar\r\ncrystals, lying in a hazy milk-white semi-opaque granular matrix. The\r\nfelspar crystals are lighter and more translucent than the matrix, but\r\nare of much the same character, having a granulated or flocculent\r\nappearance, somewhat like that of the decomposed felspars in diabase.\r\nThere are numerous roundish cavities in the section which may once have\r\ncontained olivine, or some other mineral, or they may be merely\r\nvesicles.\"\r\n\r\nA qualitative analysis of this substance, made by Mr. H. M. Elder, has\r\nproved that it contains a large quantity of Silica (about 70 per cent.),\r\nand smaller proportions of Alumina, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, and\r\nPotash; together with very small amounts of Sulphuric Acid and a trace\r\nof Ammonia. Lithium is absent, and Sodium is only present in very minute\r\nquantity. Water is present to the extent of nearly 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruption of Etna in 1869 Von Waltershausen noticed on some of\r\nthe lava blocks which were still hot and smoking, silver-coloured\r\nparticles, which rapidly underwent change. An insufficient quantity for\r\nanalysis was collected, but during the eruption of 1874, Silvestri found\r\na quantity of the substance and analysed it. (_Poggendorff's Annalen_,\r\nCLVII. 165, 1876.) It possesses a specific gravity of 3·147, and shows a\r\nmetallic lustre similar to that of steel. On analysis it was found to\r\nconsist of:--\r\n\r\n    Iron        90·86\r\n    Nitrogen     9·14\r\n               ------\r\n               100·00\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds with the formula Fe{5}N{2},--a formula assigned by\r\nFremy to Nitride of iron. It has been named _Siderazote_. This new\r\nmineral species appears to be formed by the action of hydrochloric acid,\r\nand of ammonia on red-hot lava containing a large percentage of iron. It\r\nwas formed artificially by exposing fragments of lava alternately to the\r\naction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia in a red-hot tube. At a high\r\ntemperature Siderazote undergoes decomposition, nitrogen being evolved.\r\nIn contact with steam at a red heat it forms magnetite and ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mineral Constitution and Microscopic Characters of some of the\r\nLavas of Etna._\r\n\r\nBy Frank Rutley, F.R.G.S., of H.M. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cursory examination of the series of specimens collected by Mr.\r\nRodwell, seemed to show that all the lavas of Etna, irrespective of\r\ntheir differences in age, exhibit a remarkable similarity in\r\nmineralogical constitution. Occasionally, however, there appears to have\r\nbeen a little difference in their respective viscidity at the time of\r\nthe eruption, the crystals in some of them lying in all directions,\r\nwhile in others there appears to be a more or less definite arrangement\r\nof the felspar crystals, as seen in the lava of A.D. 1689.\r\n\r\nAlthough the specimens which I have examined microscopically do not\r\nappear to differ in the nature of their constituents, yet in some of\r\nthem certain minerals fluctuate in quantity, some containing a\r\ncomparatively large amount of olivine and well-developed crystals of\r\naugite, while, in others, these minerals, although one or other is\r\nalways present, are but poorly represented by minute and\r\nsparsely-disseminated grains. It seems probable that all the Etna lavas\r\ncontain traces of a vitreous residuum, since, when sections are\r\nexamined under the microscope, a more or less general darkness pervades\r\ntheir ground mass as soon as the Nicols are crossed, and this general\r\ndarkness does not appear to be dissipated during the horizontal\r\nrevolution of the sections themselves. The translucent minerals in these\r\nsections are all doubly refracting, and as I have not been able to\r\ndetect the presence of hauyne, noseau, sodalite, analcime, or any other\r\ncubic mineral in them, the natural inference is that the obscurity\r\nbetween crossed Nicols is due to amorphous matter. I have only been able\r\nto ascertain the presence of glass distinctly in a microscopic section\r\nof the lava of Salto di Pulichello. In the other sections which I have\r\nexamined there appears to be a small quantity of interstitial glass, but\r\nit is so finely disseminated between the microliths of felspar and\r\ngranules of olivine, augite and magnetite, which constitute the\r\nground-mass of these rocks, that it is most difficult to determine the\r\nsingle refraction of such minute specks during revolution between\r\ncrossed Nicols, and I therefore merely express a belief, which, in some\r\ninstances, I cannot demonstrate with any certainty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sections of Etna Lavas seen under the Microscope]\r\n\r\nPlagioclastic felspars are unquestionably the dominant constituents of\r\nthese lavas. Lyell, in his \"Principles of Geology,\" (9th Edition, p.\r\n411), states that the felspar is Labradorite. He does not, however, give\r\nthe grounds for this conclusion, and, as microscopic examination alone\r\nmerely indicates the crystalline system and not the species of felspar,\r\nit is unsafe to speculate upon this point in the absence of chemical\r\ninvestigation. In some of these lavas Sanidine is also present, but it\r\nis always subordinate to the plagioclase, and does not, as a rule,\r\nappear to play a part sufficiently prominent to entitle the rock to the\r\nappellation Trachy-dolerite.\r\n\r\nAugite and olivine are generally present in the Etna lavas, especially\r\nthe latter mineral.\r\n\r\nMagnetite appears to occur in all of them. Titaniferous iron may also be\r\nrepresented, but I have failed to detect any well-defined crystals, or\r\nany traces of the characteristic white decomposition product which would\r\njustify me in citing the presence of this mineral, although it is stated\r\nby Lyell to occur in these rocks.\r\n\r\nThe constituent minerals of the Etna lavas now to be described, namely,\r\nthose of B.C. 396 and A.D. 1535, 1603 and 1689, are:--\r\n\r\nPlagioclase, augite, olivine, magnetite, and, in some cases,\r\nsanidine--possibly titaniferous iron--and in some, if not in all, a\r\nslight residuum of glass. These lavas must therefore be regarded as\r\nplagioclase-basalts, or occasionally as olivine-basalts. The plagioclase\r\ncrystals vary greatly in size, some being mere microliths while others\r\nare over the eighth of an inch in length. They show the characteristic\r\ntwin lamellation by polarized light, but the lamellæ are often very\r\nirregular as regards their boundaries. The sections of the crystals\r\nthemselves are also frequently bounded by irregular outlines, but they\r\noften show internally delicate zonal markings, as indicated in Fig.\r\n1,[22] which correspond with the outlines of perfectly developed\r\ncrystals. The inclosures in the larger plagioclastic felspars consist\r\nfor the most part either of brownish glass, containing fine dark\r\ngranular matter--probably magnetite, which often renders them\r\nopaque,--or of matter similar to that which constitutes the groundmass\r\nof the surrounding rock. These stone and glass cavities are very\r\nnumerous and most irregular in outline, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. They\r\nappear, however, to be elongated generally in the direction of the\r\nplanes of composition of the twin lamellæ. Zirkel has noted the\r\nplentiful occurrence of these glass inclosures in the felspar crystals\r\nand fragments of crystals which partly constitute the volcanic sands of\r\nEtna, in which he has also detected the presence of numerous isolated\r\nparticles of brownish glass.[23] The felspar microliths, which\r\nconstitute so large a proportion of the ground-mass in the Etna lavas,\r\nare in most instances probably triclinic. Monoclinic felspar does,\r\nhowever, occur in some of these rocks; but the difficulty of\r\nascertaining the precise character of microliths renders it unsafe to\r\nspeculate on the amount of sanidine which may be present. Some crystals,\r\nsuch as that shown in the centre of Fig. 2, appear at first sight to be\r\nsanidine, twinned on the Carlsbad type, but closer inspection often\r\ndemonstrates the presence of other and very delicate twin lamellæ.\r\n\r\n[22] _The figures in this plate are magnified 35 diameters._ Fig. 1.\r\nLava of B.C. 396. The upper half of the drawing is occupied by a crystal\r\nof plagioclastic felspar showing twin lamellation and faint zonal\r\nmarkings, and with numerous irregular dark-brown inclosures of glass,\r\nprobably containing magnetite dust and matter similar to that of the\r\ngroundmass of the rock which consists of felspar microliths, granules of\r\nolivine, and augite crystals, grains of magnetite, and apparently a\r\nlittle interstitial glass. A crystal of augite is shown near the bottom\r\nof the drawing.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Lava of A.D. 1689. On the right hand side part of a plagioclase\r\ncrystal with inclosures similar to that in the preceding figure. In the\r\ncentre a small crystal of plagioclase. Groundmass similar to that of\r\nFig. 1, but showing a somewhat definite arrangement of the small felspar\r\ncrystals, indicative of fluxion.\r\n\r\n[23] \"Mikroskopische Beschaffenheit der Mineralien und Gesteine.\"\r\nLeipzig, 1873; p. 480.\r\n\r\nThe augite in these lavas sometimes occurs in well-formed crystals of a\r\ngreen or brown colour, and often shows the characteristic cleavage very\r\nwell, especially in the augite crystals of the lava of the Boccarelle\r\ndel Fuoco, erupted in 1535. A small crystal of green augite is\r\nrepresented at the bottom of Fig. 1. Augite, however, appears to be more\r\nplentiful in the rocks in the form of small roundish grains.\r\n\r\nOlivine is of very common occurrence in the Etna lavas, mostly in round\r\nor irregularly shaped grains, but also in crystals which usually exhibit\r\nrounded angles.\r\n\r\nA specimen of lava from Salto di Pulichello, erupted in 1603, gave\r\nwell-developed examples of the presence of olivine, and also of\r\nplagioclase. The ground mass was found to consist of felspar microliths,\r\nand grains of olivine, augite, and magnetite, with some interstitial\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nMagnetite is present in all of the lavas here described. It occurs both\r\nin octahedral crystals and in the form of irregular grains and fine\r\ndust. To the presence of this substance much of the opacity of thin\r\nsections of the Etna lavas is due.\r\n\r\nTitaniferous iron may also be present. One small crystal in the lava of\r\n1535 appeared to show a somewhat characteristic form, but although much\r\nof the black opaque matter has undergone decomposition, I have failed to\r\ndetect any of the white or greyish alteration product which\r\ncharacterises titaniferous iron, and in the absence of this, of definite\r\ncrystalline form, and of chemical analysis, it seems better to speak of\r\nthis mineral with reserve, although titanium is very probably present,\r\nsince much magnetite is known to be titaniferous.\r\n\r\nThe vitreous matter which occurs in these lavas is principally present\r\nin the form of inclosures in the felspar, and, sometimes, the augite and\r\nolivine crystals previously described. Its occurrence in the groundmass\r\nof these rocks has also been alluded to. In this interstitial condition\r\nits amount is usually very small--a fact already pointed out by Zirkel.\r\n\r\nI have unfortunately had no opportunity of examining the volcanic sands\r\nand ashes of Etna, but Zirkel's description of them seems to indicate\r\ntheir close mineralogical relation to lavas erupted in this district,\r\nwith one exception, as pointed out by Rosenbusch,[24] namely, that he\r\nmakes no mention of the occurrence of olivine in these ejectamenta.\r\n\r\n[24] \"Mikroskopische Physiographie der Massigen Gesteine. Stuttgart,\r\n1877; p. 547.\r\n\r\nReference to the Figures 1 and 2 will suffice to show how close a\r\nrelationship in mineral constitution exists between these two lavas,\r\nseparated in the dates of their eruption by an interval of over two\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_New Maps of Etna._--After these pages had received their final revision\r\nin type, I met with two new maps of Etna in the Paris Exhibition. The\r\nliterature of our subject will obviously be incomplete without some\r\nnotice of them, although this belongs properly to the first chapter\r\nrather than to the last. The one is a map in relief constructed by\r\nCaptain Francesco Pistoja for the _Istituto Topografico Militare_ of\r\nFlorence. The vertical scale is 1/25,000 and the horizontal is 1/50,000.\r\nThe surface is coloured geologically: the lavas erupted during each\r\ncentury being differently coloured, while the course of each stream is\r\ntraced. This map, although by no means free from errors, is a vast\r\nimprovement on the relief map of M. Elie de Beaumont. One defect, which\r\nmight be easily remedied, is due to the fact that the lavas of three\r\nconsecutive centuries are coloured so much alike, that it is almost\r\nimpossible to distinguish them. The minor cones are well shown, the Val\r\ndel Bove fairly well, and the map is altogether a valuable addition to\r\nour knowledge of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe other map is a _Carta Agronomica dell' Etna_, showing the surface\r\ncultivation. Different colours denote different plants, pistachio nuts,\r\nvines, olives, chestnuts, etc. It is beautifully drawn and coloured by\r\nhand, and is the work of Signor L. Ardini, of Catania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abich, 22\r\n    Acesines, River, 81\r\n    Aci Reale, 72, 73\r\n    Acis, River, 73\r\n    Acque Grande, 73\r\n    Aderno, 65\r\n    Adranum, City of, 66\r\n    Æschylus, 4\r\n    Aetna, Town of, 64\r\n    Ajo, Fountain of, 85\r\n    Alcantara, Valley of, 69\r\n    Amphinomus, 80\r\n    Analcime, Analysis of, 128\r\n    Analcite, 127\r\n    Analysis of Augite, 126\r\n        \"    \"  Labradorite, 125, 126\r\n        \"    \"  Olivine, 127\r\n        \"    \"  Titaniferous Iron, 127\r\n        \"    \"  Analcime, 128\r\n        \"    \"  Mineral Oil, 129\r\n        \"    \"  Volcanic Ashes, 131\r\n        \"    \"  Lava, 131, 132\r\n        \"    \"  Sand, 131\r\n        \"    \"  Scoriæ, 131\r\n        \"       Microscopic, of Lavas, 135-141\r\n        \"    \"  Siderazote, 133, 134\r\n        \"    \"  Sublimations, 132\r\n        \"    \"  white friable substance, 133\r\n    Anapias, 80\r\n    Arethusa, Fountain of, 85\r\n    Ascent, Fatigue of, 60\r\n    Ashes, Volcanic, Analysis of, 131\r\n      \"        \"   Specific Gravity of, 130\r\n    Atlas des Aetna, 23\r\n    Augite, Analysis of, 126\r\n    Axis of Mongibello, 119, 122\r\n      \"   \" Trifoglietto, 119, 122\r\n\r\n    Baltzer, 24\r\n    Basalt, Columnar, 75\r\n    Base, Circumference of, 30\r\n    Belpasso, 63\r\n    Bembo, Cardinal, 10\r\n    Biancavilla, 65\r\n    Boccarelle del Fuoco, 36\r\n    Bocche eruttive, 110\r\n       \"   del Fuoco, 36\r\n    Borelli, 90\r\n    Bosco di Bronte, 99\r\n    Botanical Regions, 40-42\r\n    Boundaries of Etna, 29\r\n    Brilliancy of Stars, 48, 49\r\n    Bronte, 67, 68\r\n    Brydone, 15\r\n\r\n    Campi Phlegræi, 14\r\n    Campus Piorum, 80\r\n    Cardinal Bembo, 10\r\n    Carpinetto, Forest of, 39\r\n    Carrera, 12\r\n    Casa del Bosco, 48\r\n      \"  Inglesi, 51, 52\r\n    Castagno di Cento Cavalli, 39\r\n        \"    della Galea, 39\r\n    Catania, 76-78\r\n       \"  Destruction of, 94-96\r\n    Caverns of Etna, 37\r\n    Cavern of Thalia, 37\r\n    Centenario, 108\r\n    Chestnuts, 39\r\n    Circumference of base, 30\r\n    Cisterna, 101\r\n    Coltivata, Regione, 37, 38\r\n    Cones, Minor, 34-36\r\n    Crater of Elevation, 114\r\n       \"   of Eruption, 114\r\n       \"   The Great, 56-58\r\n    Craters, Minor, 34-36\r\n    Cultivated Region, 38\r\n    Cyclops, Rocks of, 75\r\n\r\n    Decomposed Lava, Analysis of, 133\r\n    Desert Region, 39, 40\r\n\r\n    Effects of Refraction, 59, 60\r\n    Elevation, Crater of, 114\r\n    Elie de Beaumont, 21\r\n    Elie de Beaumont's Classification, 115, 116\r\n    Empedokles, 10\r\n    Errors in Maps, 24\r\n    Eruption, Crater of, 114\r\n    Eruptions, General Character of, 112\r\n        \"      Number of, 113\r\n    Etna, the Home of Early Myths, 9\r\n      \"   a Submarine Volcano, 122\r\n    Enceladus, 4\r\n\r\n    Fatigue of Ascent, 60\r\n    Fazzello, 11\r\n    Ferrara, 15, 16\r\n    Filoteo, 11\r\n    Flood of 1755, 98\r\n    Forest of Carpinetto, 39\r\n    Fratelli Pii, Cone of, 111\r\n    Fumaroles, Sublimations of, 132\r\n    Fuoco, Regione del, 37\r\n\r\n    Gemellaro, Giuseppe, 18\r\n        \"      Mario, 19\r\n        \"      Carlo, 19, 20\r\n    General aspect of Etna, 34\r\n    _Genista Etnensis_, 45\r\n    Geological Maps of Etna, 117-18\r\n    Gibel Uttamat, 3\r\n    Gladstone's Account of Eruption, 58\r\n    Gravity, Specific, of Ejectamenta, 130\r\n    Great Crater, 57, 58\r\n    Grotto of Polyphemus, 75\r\n       \"  delle Palombe, 37\r\n    Growth of a Volcano, 123\r\n    Gurrita, Lake, 68\r\n\r\n    Hamilton, 14\r\n    Height of Etna, 26, 27\r\n    Hephaistos, Forge of, 4\r\n    Himilco, 81\r\n    Hoffmann, 22\r\n    Homer, 4\r\n    Houel, 14\r\n    Hybla Major, 63\r\n\r\n    Increase of Population, 33\r\n    Inessa, City of, 64\r\n    Inglesi, Casa, 51, 52\r\n    Inns, Sicilian, 65, 67, 69\r\n    Iron, Nitride of, 134\r\n      \"   Perchloride of, 132\r\n    Iron, Titaniferous, 127\r\n    Isola d'Aci, 75\r\n\r\n    Katana, 76, 77\r\n    Kircher, 12\r\n\r\n    Labradorite, Analysis of, 125, 126\r\n    La Cisterna, 101\r\n    Latitude of Crater, 2\r\n    La Scaletta, 75\r\n    Lava, Analysis of, 131, 132\r\n      \"   Specific Gravity of, 130\r\n      \"   Decomposed, Analysis of, 133\r\n    Lavas, Microscopic Analysis of, 135-141\r\n    Lavas of Etna, 125-141\r\n    Linguaglossa, 70\r\n    Longitude of Crater, 2\r\n    Lucilius Junior, 7-9\r\n    Lucretius, 6\r\n    Lyell, 23\r\n    Lyell's Researches, 118-122\r\n\r\n    Magnetite, 139\r\n    Maletto, 68\r\n    Maps, Geological, of Etna, 117, 118\r\n      \"   of Etna, 13, 16, 21-24\r\n    Mascali, 71\r\n    Microscopic Analysis of Lavas, 135-141\r\n    Milo, 108\r\n    Mineral Oil in Lava, 129\r\n    Minor Cones, 34-36\r\n    Mongibello, 3\r\n        \"      Axis of, 122\r\n    Monte Calanna, 107\r\n       \"  Capreolo, 118\r\n       \"  di Mojo, 36,81\r\n       \"  Minardo, 34\r\n       \"  Ste.
