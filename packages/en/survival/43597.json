A. MACALISTER              30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY OF THE FENLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fenland is a buried basin behind a breached barrier. It is the\r\n\"drowned\" lower end of a valley system in which glacial, marine,\r\nestuarine, fluviatile, and subaerial deposits have gradually\r\naccumulated, while the area has been intermittently depressed until\r\nmuch of the Fenland is now many feet below high water in the adjoining\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe history of the denudation which produced the large geographical\r\nfeatures upon which the character of the Fenland depends needs no long\r\ndiscussion, as there are numerous other districts where different\r\nstages of the same action can be observed.\r\n\r\nIn the Weald for instance where the Darent and the Medway once ran off\r\nhigher ground over the chalk to the north, cutting down their channels\r\nthrough what became the North Downs, as the more rapidly denuded beds\r\non the south of the barrier were being lowered. The character of the\r\nbasin is less clear in this case because it is cut off by the sea on\r\nthe east, but the cutting down of the gorges _pari passu_ with the\r\ndenudation of the hinterland can be well seen.\r\n\r\nThe Thames near Oxford began to run in its present course when the land\r\nwas high enough to let the river flow eastward over the outcrops of\r\nOolitic limestones which, by the denudation of the clay lands on the\r\nwest, by and by stood out as ridges through which the river still holds\r\nits course to the sea--the lowering of the clay lands on the west\r\nhaving to wait for the deepening of the gorges through the limestone\r\nridges. A submergence which would allow the sea to ebb and flow through\r\nthese widening gaps would produce conditions there similar to those of\r\nour fenlands. So also the Witham and the Till kept on lowering their\r\nbasin in the Lias and Trias, while their united waters cut down the\r\ngorge near Lincoln through a barrier now 250 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe basin of the Humber gives us an example of a more advanced stage in\r\nthe process. The river once found its way to the sea at a much higher\r\nlevel over the outcrops of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks west of Hull,\r\ncutting down and widening the opening, while the Yorkshire Ouse, with\r\nthe Aire, the Calder and other tributaries, were levelling the New Red\r\nSandstone plain and valleys west of the barrier and tapping more and\r\nmore of the water from the uplands beyond. The equivalent of the Wash\r\nis not seen behind the barrier in the estuary of the Humber, but the\r\ntidal water runs far up the river and produces the fertile estuarine\r\nsilt known as the Warp.\r\n\r\nThe Fenland is only an example of a still further stage in this\r\nprocess. The Great Ouse and its tributaries kept on levelling the Gault\r\nand Kimmeridge and Oxford Clays at the back of the chalk barrier which\r\nonce crossed the Wash between Hunstanton and Skegness.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands thus formed lie in the basin of the Great Ouse which\r\nincludes the Fenland, while the Fenland includes more than the Fens\r\nproperly defined, so that things recorded as found in the Fenland may\r\nbe much older than the Fen deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSIDENCE OF THE VALLEY OF THE CAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the slow denudation which resulted in the formation of this\r\nbasin many things happened. There were intermittent and probably\r\nirregular movements of elevation and depression. Glacial conditions\r\nsupervened and passed away.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this may be seen in the Sections, Figs. 1, 2 and 3, pp. 8,\r\n9 and 10.\r\n\r\nAt Sutton Bridge the alluvium has been proved to a depth of 73 feet\r\nresting on Boulder Clay. At Impington the Boulder Clay runs down to a\r\ndepth of 86 feet below the surface level of the alluvium. That means\r\nthat this part of the valley was scooped out before the glacial\r\ndeposits were dropped in it, and that the bottom of the ancient valley\r\nis now far below sea level.\r\n\r\nIn front of Jesus College, gravel with _Elephas primigenius_ was\r\nexcavated down to a depth of 30 feet below the street, while in the\r\nPaddocks behind Trinity College the still more recent alluvium was\r\nproved to a depth of 45 feet, i.e. 16 feet below O.D. These facts\r\nindicate a comparatively recent subsidence along the valley, as no\r\nriver could scoop out its bed below sea level.\r\n\r\nWe need not for our present purpose stop to enquire whether this\r\ndepression was confined to the line of the valley or was part of more\r\nwidespread East Anglian movements which are not so easy to detect on\r\nthe higher ground. From the above-mentioned sections it is clear that\r\nthe denudation, which resulted in the formation of the basin in the\r\nlowest hollow of which the Fen Beds lie, was a slow process begun and\r\ncarried on long before glacial conditions prevailed and before the\r\ngravel terraces were formed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sea began to ebb and flow through the opening in the\r\nbarrier, the conditions were greatly altered and we see the results of\r\nthe conflict between the mud-carrying upland waters and the\r\nbeach-forming sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBIFEROUS AND ARENIFEROUS SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fen Beds belong to the last stage and, notwithstanding their great\r\nlocal differences, seem all to belong to one continuous series. Seeing\r\nthen that their chief characteristic is that they commonly contain\r\nbeds of peat it may be convenient to form a word from the late Latin\r\n_turba_, turf or peat, and call them Turbiferous to distinguish them\r\nfrom the Areniferous series which consists almost entirely of sands\r\nand gravels.\r\n\r\nWhen the land had sunk so far that the velocity of the streams was\r\nchecked over the widening estuary and on the other hand the tide and\r\nwind waves had more free access, some outfalls got choked and others\r\nopened; turbid water sometimes spread over the flats and left mud or\r\nwas elsewhere filtered through rank plant growth so that it stood clear\r\nin meres and swamps, allowing the formation of peat unmixed with earthy\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nBanks are naturally formed along the margin of rivers by the settling\r\ndown of sand and mud when the waters overflow, as seen on a large scale\r\nalong the Mississippi, the Po, as well as along the Humber and its\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a break down of the banks is very different. A great hole\r\nis scooped out by the outrush, and the mud, sand and gravel deposited\r\nin a fanshape according to its degree of coarseness and specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nA good example of this was seen in the disastrous Mid-Level flood at\r\nLynn in 1862[1] and the more recent outburst near Denver in the winter\r\nof 1914-15[2], of which accounts were published in contemporary\r\nnewspapers. The varied accompanying phenomena can be well studied in\r\nthe process of warping in Yorkshire or the colmata in Italy.\r\n\r\n          [1] _Times_, _Cambridge Chronicle_, May 31, 1862.\r\n\r\n          [2] _Times_, Jan. 16, 1915.\r\n\r\nThis was a much commoner catastrophe in old times, before the banks\r\nwere artificially raised, and, as the streams could never get back into\r\ntheir old raised channel, this accounts for the network of ancient\r\nriver beds which intersect the Fens.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Turbiferous alluvium is always, as far as my\r\nexperience goes, sharply defined. This of course cannot be seen in a\r\nborehole or very small section.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the older deposits seems to have been often washed clean\r\neither by the encroaching sea or by the upland flood waters.\r\n\r\nIn saying that there is an absence of sand and gravel in the Fen Beds\r\nwe must be careful not to force this description too far. For when the\r\nfirst encroaching water was washing away any pre-existing superficial\r\ndeposits the first material left as the base of the Fen Beds must have\r\ndepended upon the character of the underlying strata, the velocity of\r\nthe water and other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis is well seen in the Whittlesea brickpit where an ancient gravel\r\nwith marine shells rests on the Oxford Clay and over the gravel there\r\ncreeps the base of the Turbiferous series. It here consists chiefly of\r\nwhite marl which thins out to the left of the section and above becomes\r\nfull of vegetable matter until it passes up into peat, over which there\r\nis a flood-water loam.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile west-north-west of Little Downham near Ely, and within a\r\ncouple of hundred yards of Hythe, the Fen Beds were seen in a deep cut\r\ncarried close to the gravel hill which here stretches out north into\r\nthe Fens.\r\n\r\nThey consist at the base of material washed down from the spur of\r\ngravel and sand of the Areniferous series against which the Fen Beds\r\nhere abut.\r\n\r\nThis basement bed is succeeded by beds of silt and peat of no great\r\nthickness as they are near the margin of the swamp.\r\n\r\nWhen any considerable thickness of the older Areniferous gravels has\r\nbeen preserved, the base of the Turbiferous series is smooth or only\r\ngently undulating. But where only small patches or pot-holes of gravel\r\nremain, there the top of the clay has been contorted and over-folded so\r\nas often to contain irregularly curved pipes and even isolated nests of\r\nsand and gravel[3]. The base of the Areniferous gravel must generally\r\nhave been thrown down upon clay which had been clean cut to an even\r\nsurface by denudation without any soaking of the surface or isolated\r\nheaps of gravel sinking into the clay under alternation of dry and wet\r\nconditions, such as would puddle the surface under the heaps and allow\r\nthe masses of heavy gravel to sink in pipes and troughs. These small\r\noutlying patches of gravel are sometimes so little disturbed that we\r\nleave them in the Areniferous, whereas they are sometimes so obviously\r\nrearranged that we must include them in the Turbiferous series, taking\r\ncare not to include derivative bones from the older in our list of\r\nfossils from the newer series.\r\n\r\n          [3] Cf. _Archaeol. Journ._ Vol. LXIX, No. 274 2nd Ser.; Vol.\r\n          XIX, No. 2, pp. 205-214.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF ELEPHANT AND RHINOCEROS IN TURBIFEROUS SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basement beds of the Turbiferous or Newer Alluvial Fen Beds are\r\nclearly separated by their stratification from the Areniferous or Older\r\nAlluvial Terrace Beds down the sloping margin of which they creep, but\r\nthere is not anywhere, as far as I am aware, any passage or dovetailing\r\nof the Fen Beds into the gravel of the river terraces, while the\r\ndifference in the fauna is very marked.\r\n\r\nIt is however from such sections as those just described that the\r\nerroneous view arose that the Elephant and Rhinoceros occurred in the\r\nolder Fen Beds. It is true that they have been found under peat in the\r\nFenland, but that is only where the gravel spurs of the Old Alluvial\r\nTerraces or Areniferous Series have passed under the newer Fen Beds.\r\n\r\nI saw the remains of _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_ in the gravel beds\r\nbelonging to the older or Areniferous Series at Little Downham, and\r\nfrom the base of the gravel in the Whittlesea brickpit I obtained a\r\nfine lower molar of _Elephas antiquus_. This was, however, not in\r\nthe Gravel, but squeezed into the soft surface of the underlying\r\nJurassic Clay.\r\n\r\nThere have never been any remains of Elephant or Rhinoceros found in\r\nthe Turbiferous series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF PEAT IN ARENIFEROUS SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to realise what the conditions were during the formation\r\nof the later Terrace Gravels (Barnwell type), and, if it is a fact, why\r\nthere was not then, as in later times, a marshy peat-bearing area here\r\nand there between the torrential deposits of the upper streams near the\r\nfoot of the hills and the region where the tide met the upland waters.\r\nA few plants have been found in the Barnwell gravel but they are very\r\nrare in this series. The older Terrace Gravel (Barrington type) might\r\nbe expected to furnish evidence of the existence of abundant vegetation\r\nif we are right in assigning it to about the age of the peaty deposits\r\noverlying the Weybourn Crag. But at present we have no evidence of any\r\nsuch deposit in the Cambridge gravels.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are great masses of vegetable matter formed in the\r\nswamps of tropical regions, peat is essentially a product of northern\r\nclimes. Pliny[4] evidently refers to peat as used in Friesland but not\r\nas a thing with which he was familiar.\r\n\r\n          [4] Lib. XVI, cap. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEN BEDS NOT ALL PEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be imagined that the Fen Beds consist wholly or\r\neven chiefly of peat. As we travel north from Cambridge the surface of\r\nthe alluvium is brown earth for miles and only here and there shows the\r\nblack surface of peat. The numerous ditches for draining the land\r\nconfirm this observation, and when we have the opportunity of examining\r\nexcavations carried down to great depths into the alluvium we usually\r\nfind only a little peat on the surface or in thin beds alternating with\r\nsilt and clay and marl. Sometimes, but only sometimes, we have evidence\r\nof the growth of peat for a long time, then of the incoming of turbid\r\nwater leaving beds of clay, then again of the tranquil growth of peat.\r\nAll this points to changes of local conditions and shifting channels\r\nduring a gradual sinking of the area, for some of the peat is below sea\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nI believe that the volume of clay is much greater than that of peat,\r\nalthough from the common occurrence of peat on the surface and clay in\r\nthe depth the area over which peat is seen is greater. We have not,\r\nhowever, the data for estimating the proportion of each.\r\n\r\nIn embayed corners along the river even above Cambridge we find little\r\npatches of peat, while on the other hand in deep excavations near the\r\nmiddle of the valley we find only thin streaks of peat or peaty silt.\r\nIn the trial boreholes at the Backs of the Colleges there was only this\r\nkind of record of former swamp vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTIONS IN ALLUVIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn digging the foundations for the chimney of the Electric Lighting\r\nWorks opposite Magdalene College the following section was seen (Fig.\r\n1, p. 8).\r\n\r\nUnder the new Tennis Courts in Park Parade facing Mid-summer Common the\r\nsection was somewhat different (Fig. 2, p. 9).\r\n\r\nWhile in the pit dug some years ago by Mr Bullock at the other end of\r\nthe Parade at the lower end of Portugal Place in the south-east corner\r\nof the Common there was a section very similar to the last (Fig. 3, p.\r\n10).\r\n\r\n    +------\r\n    |                Made ground\r\n    |\r\n    |        7'-8'\r\n    |\r\n    +------\r\n    |                Black silt\r\n    |\r\n    |        7'-8'\r\n    |\r\n    +------\r\n    |        4'      Peaty silt\r\n    |\r\n    +------\r\n    |        4'      Gravel\r\n    |\r\n    +------\r\n    |                Gault\r\n    |\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Section seen in foundations of chimney for\r\nElectric Lighting Works near river opposite Magdalene College, July,\r\n1892.]\r\n\r\nThese three sections, immediately north of Cambridge where the valley\r\nof the Cam opens out on to the Fens, are important as showing the\r\nvariations right across the alluvium from side to side and the absence,\r\nhere at any rate, of any indication of a constant sequence distinctly\r\npointing to important geographical changes. A section seen under\r\nPembroke College Boat House gave 16 feet of clay and peaty silt on the\r\nblack gravel which here, as in the borings at the Backs of the\r\nColleges, forms the base of the alluvium.

Section seen at Sutton Bridge.]\r\n\r\nHere again we see that the only peat is a bed between three and four\r\nfeet in thickness of mixed loam and peat more than 40 feet below mean\r\nsea level.\r\n\r\nFrom these sections it is clear that along the direct and more\r\npermanent outfall from Cambridge to the north, peat forms but a small\r\npart of the Fen Beds.\r\n\r\nPeat is a substance of so much value as fuel, of such importance to the\r\nagriculturist, of such commercial value in what we may call its\r\nby-products, and of such scientific interest in the history of its\r\nformation and the remains which its antiseptic properties have\r\npreserved, that it has, as might be expected, a large literature of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI have before me a list of more than 150 references to peat or to the\r\nFens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAT; TREES AND OTHER PLANTS; TARN PEAT AND HILL PEAT; BOG-OAK AND\r\nBOG-IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we turn aside into the areas cut off by spurs of gravel and\r\nislands of Jurassic rock, we find wide and deep masses of peat which\r\nhas grown and been preserved from denudation in these embayed and\r\nisolated areas. Burwell Fen, for instance, protected on the north and\r\nwest by the Cretaceous ridge of Wicken and the Jurassic ridge of\r\nUpware, furnishes most of the peat used in the surrounding district. If\r\nwe travel about two miles to the north-west from the pit dug near the\r\nrailway station (see Fig. 4, p. 11) over the hill on which Ely stands,\r\nwe shall come to West Fen, where there is a great mass of peat which\r\nhas grown in a basin now almost quite surrounded by Kimmeridge Clay.\r\nIn this there is a great quantity of timber at a small depth from the\r\nsurface. The tree trunks almost all lie with their root-end to the\r\nsouth-west, but some are broken off, some are uprooted, telling\r\nclearly a story of growth on the peat which had increased and swelled\r\ntill the surface was lifted above the level of floods. Then some\r\nchange--perhaps more rapid subsidence, perhaps changes in the\r\noutfalls--let in flood water, the roots rotted and a storm from the\r\nsouth-west, which was the most exposed side and the direction of the\r\nprevalent winds, laid them low. The frequent occurrence of large\r\nfunguses, _Hypoxylon_, _Polyporus_, etc., points to conditions at\r\ntimes unfavourable to the healthy growth of timber.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting when trying to read the story of the Fens as\r\nrecorded by their fallen trees that in all forests we find now and then\r\na few trees blown down together though the surrounding trees are left.\r\nThis may be the result of a fierce eddy in the cycloidal path of the\r\nstorm, but more commonly it seems to be due to the fact that every tree\r\nhas its \"play,\" like a fishing rod, and recurring gusts, not coinciding\r\nwith its rhythm, sometimes catch it at a disadvantage and break or blow\r\nit down.\r\n\r\nThe story told by the West Fen trees is quite different from that told\r\nby the water-borne and water-worn trunks in the section by Ely station.\r\n\r\nThe same variable conditions prevailed also in the more westerly tracts\r\nof the Fen Basin, but the above examples are sufficient for our present\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the large numbers of trees found in some localities and from\r\nrecords referring to parts of the Fens as _forest_ it has sometimes\r\nbeen supposed that the Fens were well wooded, but forest did not\r\ngenerally and does not now always mean a wood, as for example in the\r\ncase of the deer forests of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingulph[5] says that portions of the Fenland were disafforested by\r\nHenry I, Stephen, Henry II, and Richard, who gave permission to build\r\nupon the marshes, this probably meant that they no longer preserved\r\nthem so strictly, but allowed people to build on the gravel banks and\r\nislands in them.\r\n\r\n          [5] _History of Croyland_, Bohn's edition, p. 282.\r\n\r\nDugdale, recording a stricter enforcement of game-laws, quotes\r\nproceedings against certain persons in Whittlesea, Thorney and Ramsey\r\nfor having \"wasted all the fen of Kynges-delfe of the alders, hassacks\r\nand rushes so that the King's deer could not harbour there.\" He does\r\nnot mention forest trees.\r\n\r\nIn the growth and accidents of vegetation in a swamp there are some\r\ncircumstances which are of importance to note with a view to the\r\ninterpretation of the results observed in the Fens.\r\n\r\nFor instance in fine weather there is a constant lifting and floating\r\nof the confervoid algae which grow on the muddy bed of the stream. This\r\nis brought about by the development of gas under the sun's influence in\r\nthe thick fibrous growth of the alga. The little bubbles give it a\r\nsilvery gleam and by and by produce sufficient buoyancy in the mass to\r\ntear it out and make it rise to the surface dropping fine mud as it\r\ngoes and thus making the water turbid. Other plants, such as\r\nUtricularia, Duckweed, etc., have their period of flotation, and in the\r\n\"Breaking of the Mere\" in Shropshire we have a similar phenomenon. In\r\nthe \"Floating Island\" on Derwentwater the same sort of thing is seen\r\nwith coarser plants. All these processes are going on in the meres and\r\nin the streams which meander through the Fens and did so more freely\r\nbefore their reclamation. But besides this, when the top of the spongy\r\npeat is raised above the water level and dries by evaporation, then\r\nheath, ferns and other plants and at last trees grow on it, until\r\naccident submerges it all again.\r\n\r\nThis at once shows why we often find an upper peat with a different\r\ngroup of plant remains resting upon a lower peat with plants that grow\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous examples of these various kinds of peat we see in\r\nthe mountainous regions of the North and West, where the highest hills\r\nare often capped with peat from eight to ten feet in thickness,\r\ncreeping over the brow and hanging on the steep mountain sides.\r\nSometimes, close by, we see the gradual growth of peat from the margin\r\nof a tarn where only water-weeds can flourish.\r\n\r\nThe \"Hill Peat\" is made up of Sphagnum and other mosses and of ferns\r\nand heather.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tarn Peat\" of conferva, potamogeton, reeds, etc.\r\n\r\nAs Hill Peat now grows on the heights and steeps where no water can\r\nstand and Tarn Peat in lakes and ponds lying in the hollows of the\r\nmountains and moors, so the changes in the outfalls and the swelling\r\nand sinking of the peat have given us in the Fens, here the results of\r\na dry surface with its heather and ferns and trees, and there products\r\nof water-weeds only, and, from the nature of the case, the subaerial\r\ngrowth is apt to be above the subaqueous.\r\n\r\nOne explanation of the growth of peat under both of these two very\r\ndifferent geographical conditions is probably the absence of\r\nearthworms. The work of the earthworm is to drag down and destroy\r\ndecaying vegetable matter and to cast the mineral soil on to the\r\nsurface, but earthworms cannot live in water or in waterlogged land,\r\nand where there are no earthworms the decaying vegetation accumulates\r\nin layer after layer upon the surface, modified only by newer growths.\r\nSome years ago a great flood kept the land along the Bin Brook under\r\nwater for several days and the earthworms were all killed, covering the\r\npaddock in front of St John's New Buildings in such numbers that when\r\nthey began to decompose it was quite disagreeable to walk that way. It\r\nreminded me of the effects of storm on the cocklebeds at the mouth of\r\nthe Medway, where the shells were washed out of the mud, the animals\r\ndied on the shore and the empty shells were in time washed round the\r\ncoast of Sheppey to the sheltered corner at Shellness. Here they lie\r\nsome ten feet deep and are dug to furnish the material for London\r\npathways.\r\n\r\nIn those cases when the storm had passed the earthworms and the cockles\r\ncame again, but the Hill Peat is always full of water retained by the\r\nspongy Sphagnum and similar plants, and the Fens are or were\r\ncontinually, and in some places continuously, submerged and no\r\nearthworms could live under such conditions.\r\n\r\nThe blackness of peat and of bog-oak may be largely but certainly not\r\nwholly due to carbonaceous matter. Iron must play an important part.\r\nThere is in the Sedgwick Museum part of the trunk of a Sussex oak which\r\nhad grown over some iron railings and extended some eight inches or\r\nmore beyond the outside of the part which was originally driven in to\r\nhold the rails. Mr Kett came upon the buried iron when sawing up the\r\ntree in his works and kindly gave it to me. From the iron a deep black\r\nstain has travelled with the sap along the grain, as if the iron of the\r\nrail and the tannin of the oak had combined to produce an ink. The\r\nwell-known occurrence of bog-iron in peat strengthens this suggestion.\r\nAn opportunity of observing this enveloping growth of wood round iron\r\nrailings is offered in front of No. 1, Benet Place, Lensfield Road.\r\n\r\nThe trees in the Fens often lie at a small depth and when exposed to\r\nsurface changes perish by splitting along the medullary rays.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear how long it takes to impart a peaty stain to bone, but\r\nwe do find a difference between those which are undoubtedly very old\r\nand others which we have reason to believe may be more recent. Compare\r\nthe almost black bones of the beaver, for instance, with the light\r\nbrown bones of the otter in the two mounted skeletons in the Sedgwick\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Marl,\" as commonly used, is Clay or Carbonate of Lime of a clayey\r\ntexture or any mixture of these.\r\n\r\nBeds of shell marl tell the same tale as the peat. Shells do not\r\naccumulate to any extent in the bed of a river. They are pounded up and\r\ndecomposed or rolled along and buried where mud or gravel finds a\r\nresting place. Only sometimes, where things of small specific gravity\r\nare gathered in holes and embayed corners, a layer of freshwater shells\r\nmay be seen.\r\n\r\nBut to produce a bed of pure shell marl the quantity of dead shells\r\nmust be very large and the amount of sediment carried over the area\r\nvery small, while the margin of the pond or mere in which the formation\r\nof such a bed is possible must have an abundant growth of confervoid\r\nalgae and other water plants to furnish sustenance for the molluscs.\r\nShell marl therefore suggests ponds and meres. Of course it must be\r\nborne in mind that in a region of hard water, such as is yielded in\r\nsprings all along the outcrop of the chalk, there is often a\r\nconsiderable precipitation of carbonate of lime, especially where such\r\nplants as Chara help to collect it, as the Callothrix and Leptothrix\r\nhelp to throw down the Geyserite.\r\n\r\nThese beds of white marls, whether due to shells or to precipitation,\r\nare thus of great importance for our present enquiry as they throw\r\nlight on the history of the Fens.\r\n\r\nWe should have few opportunities of examining the marl were it not for\r\nits value to the agriculturist. As it consists of clay and lime, it is\r\nnot only a useful fertiliser but also helps to retain the dusty peat,\r\nwhich when dry and pulverised is easily blown away. Moreover, as the\r\nmarl occurs at a small depth and often over large areas, it can\r\ncommonly be obtained by trenching on the ground where it is most\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WASH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now carried our examination of the Fen Beds up to the sea, but\r\nto understand this interesting area we must cross the sea bank and see\r\nwhat is happening in the Wash. There is no peat being formed there, nor\r\nis there any quantity of drifted vegetable matter such as might form\r\npeat. There are marginal forest beds near Hunstanton and Holme, for\r\ninstance, and it is not clear whether they point to submergence or to\r\nthe former existence of sand dunes or shingle beaches sufficient to\r\nkeep out the sea and allow the growth of trees below high water level\r\nbehind the barrier, such as may be seen at Braunton Burrows, near\r\nWestward Ho, or at the mouth of the Somme. What is the most conspicuous\r\ncharacter of the Wash is that the upland waters, now controlled as to\r\ntheir outlet, keep open the troughs and deeps while tidal action throws\r\nup a number of shifting banks of mud, sand and gravel, many of which\r\nare left dry at low water. Along the quieter marginal portions fine\r\nsediment is laid down, and relaid when storms have disturbed the\r\nsurface. On these cockles and other estuarine molluscs thrive. Before\r\nthe sea banks were constructed these tidal flats extended much further\r\ninland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLEPORT DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the light of this evidence let us examine the Fen Beds east of\r\nLittleport, a district of great interest not only from its geographical\r\nposition in relation to the Fens but also from the remains recently\r\ndiscovered there.\r\n\r\nLooking north and west there is no high ground between us and the Wash.\r\nIf we could sweep out the soft superficial deposits and abolish the sea\r\nbanks the tide would still ebb and flow over the whole area.\r\n\r\nIf we look north and east we see the high ground stretching from\r\nDownham Market to Stoke Ferry and sweeping round to the south by\r\nMethwold and Feltwell and the islands of Hilgay and Southery, thus\r\nenclosing a great bay into which the Wissey on the north and the\r\nBrandon River on the south deliver the waters collected on the eastern\r\nchalk uplands.\r\n\r\nThe island known as Shippea Hill marks the trend of an ancient barrier\r\nblocking the northward course of the river Lark. (Fig. 6, p. 29.)\r\n\r\nHere, then, it seems probable that we might find evidence of a local\r\nchange from the conditions we now see in the Wash and those which have\r\nresulted in the formation of the Fens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERY CLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn deep trenching in the Fen between Littleport and Shippea Hill in\r\norder to obtain clay for laying on the peaty surface a very fine\r\nunctuous deposit was found at a depth of four or five feet. The\r\noverlying Fen Beds were chiefly peat with lenticular beds of white marl\r\nand grey clay, obviously laid down from time to time in small\r\ndepressions in the surface of the peat. This marl was often largely\r\nmade up of, or was at any rate full of, freshwater shells but sometimes\r\nshowed evidence of having been gathered on the stems of Chara which on\r\nperishing have left small cylindrical hollows penetrating the partly\r\nconsolidated marl. Under these beds of peat and marl there was the\r\nunctuous clay, which is sometimes referred to as the Buttery Clay. It\r\nis an estuarine deposit like that mentioned above as occurring in the\r\nWash off Heacham, for instance. It contains shells of _Cardium edule_,\r\n_Tellina_ (_Tacoma_) _balthica_, _Scrobicularia piperata_, and other\r\nestuarine shells, some of which had the valves adherent or rather\r\nadjoining, for the ligament had perished. Mrs Luddington has in her\r\ncollection the bones of the Urus, Wild Boar and Beaver, obtained from\r\nthe peat above this Buttery Clay.\r\n\r\nOn the other or south-western side of Shippea Hill, which is an island\r\nof Kimmeridge Clay, we get further into the embayed and isolated\r\nportions of the Fen and we find more peat in proportion to the other\r\ndeposits although it is very thin. There are still small lenticular\r\nbeds of white marl similar to that nearer Littleport and the peat rests\r\nupon Buttery Clay of unknown thickness. In this part, however, no\r\nshells have yet been noticed. Near Shippea Hill the peat has recently\r\nbeen trenched with a view to obtaining clay with which to dress the\r\nsurface of the peat and it was here, at a depth of four feet from the\r\nsurface and four inches above the Buttery Clay, that the human bones\r\ndescribed below (pp. 27-35) were found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF THE FEN BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we may enquire what are the limits within which we may speculate as\r\nto the age of the Fen Beds.\r\n\r\nThese Turbiferous deposits all belong to one stage, though it may be\r\none of long duration. They are sharply separated from the Areniferous\r\ndeposits, i.e. the sands and gravels of the terraces and spurs which\r\nalways pass under and, in fairly large sections, can always be clearly\r\ndistinguished from the resorted layers at the base of the Fen Beds.\r\n\r\nThere is no definite chronological succession which will hold\r\nthroughout the Fens. The variations observed are geographical--clay,\r\nmarl, peat, etc., alternating in different order in different\r\nlocalities and subaerial, fluviatile, estuarine, and marine, having\r\nonly a changing topographical significance.\r\n\r\nThe Fen Beds crept over an area where the underlying formation had been\r\nundergoing vicissitudes due to slow geographical changes--changes\r\nwhich, being at sea level and near the conflict of tides and upland\r\nwater, produced irregular but often important results.\r\n\r\nThere is not in the Fens any _continuous_ record of what took place\r\nbetween the age in which the Little Downham Rhinoceros was buried in\r\nthe gravel and that in which the Neolithic hunters poleaxed the Urus\r\nin the peat near Burwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAEONTOLOGY OF FENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor do we find any constant succession in the fauna and flora in the\r\nsections in the Fens any more than we find a uniform distribution of\r\nplants and animals over the surface to-day. The most numerous and\r\nlargest specimens of the Urus I have obtained from near Isleham: the\r\nbest preserved Beaver bones from Burwell. Modern changes of conditions\r\nhave limited the district in which the fen fern (_Thelypteris_) or\r\nthe swallow-tailed butterfly may now be seen; but nature in old times\r\nproduced as great changes in local conditions as those now due to human\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the fauna of the Areniferous Series with that of the\r\nTurbiferous, although there is not an entire sweeping away of the older\r\nvertebrate and invertebrate forms of life and an introduction of newer,\r\nthere is a marked change in the whole facies.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of evidence about Cambridge of the gradual\r\nextermination of species still going on. Indeed, I feel inclined to say\r\nthat there is no such thing as a Holocene age. I remember land shells\r\nbeing common of which it is difficult now to find live specimens, and\r\nmy wife[6] has shown how the mollusca are being differentiated in\r\nisolated ponds left here and there along the ancient river courses\r\nabove the town.\r\n\r\n          [6] \"On the Mollusca of the Pleistocene Gravels in the\r\n          neighbourhood of Cambridge,\" by Mrs McKenny Hughes. _Geol.\r\n          Mag._ Decade 3, Vol. V, No. 5, May 1888, p. 193.\r\n\r\nBut we have not in older beds of the Turbiferous or newer beds of the\r\nAreniferous Series any suggestion of continuity between the two. There\r\nmust have been between them an unrepresented period of considerable\r\nduration in which very important changes were brought about. Perhaps it\r\nwas then that England became an island and unsuitable for most of the\r\nlife of the Areniferous age.\r\n\r\nNot only have we in the Turbiferous as compared with the Areniferous\r\nSeries a change of facies but we have many \"representative forms,\" a\r\npoint to which that keen naturalist, Edward Forbes, always attached\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\nWe have for instance in the Fen Beds the Brown Bear (_Ursus arctos_)\r\nwith his flat pig-like skull, instead of the Grizzly (_Ursus ferox_)\r\nof the Gravels with his broad skull and _front bombé_.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the horned cattle we shall find a confirmation of the\r\nview that there was not an entire break between the Turbiferous and\r\nAreniferous fauna for the Urus (_Bos primigenius_) occurs in both.\r\nThis species became extinct in Britain in the Turbiferous period and\r\nbefore the coming of the Romans, for no trace of it seems to have been\r\nfound with Roman remains in this country; and indeed when we remember\r\nthe numerous tribes, the dense population and high civilisation of the\r\nnatives of Britain in Roman times it seems improbable that they can\r\nhave tolerated such a formidable beast as this wild bull around their\r\ncultivated land.\r\n\r\nSome confusion has arisen as to the description and the names of\r\nthe Urus and the Bison. Caesar, who was not a big game hunter and\r\nprobably never saw either, has given under the name Urus a description\r\nwhich evidently mixes up the characters of both. Both existed on the\r\ncontinent down to quite recent times and the Bison is still found\r\nin Poland, but later writers also have evidently confounded them.\r\nFor instance, the Augsburg picture of the Urus is correct, but\r\nHerberstein's, which also is said to represent the Urus, is obviously\r\nthat of a Bison. I have gone into this question more fully\r\nelsewhere[7].\r\n\r\n          [7] \"The Evolution of the British Breeds of Cattle,\" _Journ.\r\n          R. Agric. Soc._ Vol. V, Ser. 3, pp. 561-563, 1894. \"On the\r\n          more important Breeds of Cattle which have been recognised in\r\n          the British Isles in successive periods, and their relation\r\n          to other archaeological and historical discoveries,\"\r\n          _Archaeologia_, Vol. V, Ser. 3, pp. 125-158, 1896. Cf. also\r\n          Morse, E. W., \"The Ancestry of domesticated Cattle,\"\r\n          _Twenty-seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Animal\r\n          Industry_, 1910, Department of Agriculture, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe Urus (_Bos primigenius_) is common in the Fen Beds and is of\r\nspecial importance for our present enquiry, as there is in the Sedgwick\r\nMuseum a skull of this species found in Burwell Fen with a Neolithic\r\nflint implement sticking in it. The implement is thin, nearly parallel\r\nsided, rough dressed, except on the front edge which is ground, and it\r\nis made of the black south-country flint. It is very different in every\r\nrespect from the thick bulging implements with curved outlines, which\r\nbeing made of the mottled grey north-country flint or of felstone or\r\ngreenstone suggest importation from a different and probably more\r\nnortherly source.\r\n\r\nThis gives us a useful synchronism of peat, a Neolithic implement of a\r\nspecial well-marked type, and the Urus.\r\n\r\nThe Bison is the characteristic ox of the Gravels and never occurs in\r\nthe Fen Beds; while the Urus, as I have pointed out above, occurs in\r\nboth the Turbiferous and Areniferous deposits.\r\n\r\n_Bos longifrons_ is the characteristic ox of the Fen Beds and never\r\noccurs in the Gravels. It is the breed which the Romans found here,\r\nand we dig up its bones almost wherever we find Roman remains. I\r\ncannot adduce any satisfactory evidence that it was wild, that is to\r\nsay more wild than the Welsh cattle or ponies or sheep which roam\r\nfreely over wide tracts of almost uninhabited country. This species,\r\nlike the Urus, has horns pointing forward, but the cattle introduced\r\nby the Romans had upturned lyre-shaped horns, as in the modern\r\nItalian, the Chillingham or our typical uncrossed Ayrshire breed, and\r\nsoon we notice the effect of crossing the small native cattle (_Bos\r\nlongifrons_) with the larger Roman breed.\r\n\r\nThe Horse appears to have lived continuously throughout Pleistocene\r\ntimes down to the present day and to have been always used for food.\r\nUnfortunately the skull of a horse is thin and fragile and therefore it\r\nhas been difficult to obtain a series sufficiently complete to found\r\nany considerable generalisations upon it. The animal found in the peat\r\nand alluvium appears to have been a small sized, long faced pony.\r\n\r\nThe appearances and reappearances of the different kinds of deer is a\r\nvery interesting question, but it will be more easily treated when I\r\ncome to speak of the Gravels of East Anglia. I will only point out now\r\nthat neither of the deer with palmated antlers properly belongs to the\r\nTurbiferous series. The great Irish Elk (_Cervus megacerus_) has not\r\nbeen found in the Fen Beds. Indeed it is not clear that in Ireland it\r\noccurs in the peat. The most careful and trustworthy descriptions seem\r\nto show that its bones lie either in or on top of the clays on which\r\nthe peat grew.\r\n\r\nThe other and smaller deer with palmated antlers, namely, the Fallow\r\ndeer (_Cervus dama_), were reintroduced, probably by the Romans, and\r\nalthough some of them have got buried in the alluvium or newer peat in\r\nthe course of the 1500 years or so that they have been hunted in royal\r\nwarrens in East Anglia, they cannot be regarded as indigenous or\r\nindicative of climate or other local conditions.\r\n\r\nRemains of the Red deer (_Cervus elaphus_) and of the Roe deer\r\n(_Cervus capreolus_) are common in the Fen Beds; both occur in the\r\nGravels also; and both are still wild in the British Isles. Unlike the\r\nRed deer, which lives on the open moorland, the Roe deer lives in\r\nwoods and forests. And this is an interesting fact in its bearing upon\r\nour inferences as to the character of the country before the\r\nreclamation of the Fens and the destruction of the plateau forest. The\r\nopen downs and the spurs and islands of the fenlands offered the Red\r\ndeer a congenial feeding ground, while the thickets on the edge of the\r\nupland forest and the bosky patches along the margins of the lowland\r\nswamps provided covert for the Roe deer. Sheep and goat are found in\r\nthe peat and the alluvium, but it is not easy to tell the age of the\r\nbones. They do generally appear to be of that lighter brown colour\r\nwhich is characteristic of remains from newer peat as compared with\r\nthe black bones which seem to belong to the older and more decomposed\r\npeat. The sheep is probably a late introduction and is never found in\r\nthe Terrace Gravel (see _Geol. Mag._ Decade 2, Vol. X, No. 10, p.\r\n454).\r\n\r\nThe Wild Boar (_Sus scrofa_) is fairly common.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that we get very few remains of Wolf, although it is\r\nnot much more than 200 years since the last was killed. There is in the\r\nSedgwick Museum one fairly complete skeleton, found a long time ago in\r\nBurwell Fen and I have recently obtained another from the same\r\nlocality. There do not seem to be any obvious and constant characters\r\nby which we can distinguish a wolf from a dog, and Britain was\r\ncelebrated for its large and fierce dogs. The bones of the Eskimo dogs\r\nare very wolf-like, but they are frequently crossed with wolf.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting animal whose remains are found in the Fens\r\nis the Beaver. Why do we not find here and there a beaver dam? Perhaps\r\nit is because we have not been on the look-out for it, and the\r\npeat-cutters would not have seen anything remarkable in the occurrence\r\nof a quantity of timber anywhere in the Fens. We must suppose that the\r\npeat which often contains whole forests of trees and even canoes would\r\nhave preserved the timber of the beaver dam. It is an animal too which\r\nmight have contributed largely towards the formation of the Fens by\r\nholding up and diverting meandering streams. Perhaps it did not make\r\ndams down in the Fens, and the skeletons we find are those of stray\r\nindividuals or of dead animals which have floated down from dams near\r\nTrumpington or Chesterford; very suitable places for them. We want more\r\nevidence about the fen beaver.\r\n\r\nI have heard that there are beavers in the Danube which do not make\r\ndams, but among those introduced into this country in recent years the\r\ndam building instinct seems to have survived the change. The beavers on\r\nthe Marquis of Bute's property in Scotland cut down trees and built\r\ndams as did the beavers in Sir Edmund Loder's park in Sussex, and even\r\nin the Zoological Gardens they recently constructed a \"lodge.\" We have\r\nnot found the beaver in the Gravels.\r\n\r\nPart of the skull of a Walrus was brought to us a long time ago and\r\nsaid to have been found in the peat. But it is a very suspicious case.\r\nIt does not look like a bone that had been long entombed in peat, and\r\nwe are not so far from the coast as to make it improbable that it was\r\ncarried there by some sailor returning home from northern seas.\r\n\r\nBones of Cetaceans are thrown up on the shore near Hunstanton, and\r\nSeals are still not uncommon in the Wash, so that we need not attach\r\nmuch importance to the occurrence in marine silt of Whale, Grampus,\r\nPorpoise, and such like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have paid much attention to the birds of the Fens, partly because of\r\nthe occurrence of some unexpected species, and also because of the\r\nabsence, so far as our collection goes, of species of which we should\r\nexpect to find large numbers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting are the remains of Pelican (_P. crispus_\r\nor _onocrotalus_)[8]. Of this we have two bones, not associated nor\r\nin the same state of preservation. The determination we have on the\r\nauthority of Alphonse Milne Edwards and Professor Alfred Newton. One\r\nof the bones is that of a bird so young that it cannot have flown over\r\nbut shows that it must have been hatched or carried here.\r\n\r\n          [8] _Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Zool._ (5), Vol. VIII,\r\n          Pl. 14, pp. 285-293. _Ibis_, 1868, pp. 363-370, _Proc. Zool.\r\n          Soc._ 1868, p. 2. _Trans. Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists\r\n          Soc._ Vol. VII, Pt. 2, 1901. _Geol. Mag._ No. 447, N.S. Dec.\r\n          4, Vol. VIII, No. 9, p. 422.\r\n\r\nOf the Crane (_Grus cinerea_) we have a great number of bones but of\r\nthe common Heron not one. I have placed a recent skeleton of heron in\r\nthe case to help us to look out for and determine any that may turn\r\nup. Bones of the Bittern (_Botaurus_ or _Ardea stellaris_) are quite\r\ncommon, as are those of the Mute or tame Swan (_Cygnus olor_) as well\r\nas of the Hooper or wild Swan (_Cygnus musicus_ or _ferus_). Goose\r\n(_Anser_) and Duck (_Anas_) are not so numerous as one might have\r\nexpected. The Grey Goose (_Anser ferus_) and the Mallard (_Anas\r\nboscas_) are the most common, but other species are found, as for\r\ninstance _Anas grecca_. We have also the Red Breasted Merganser\r\n(_Mergus serrator_), and the Smew (_Mergus albellus_), the Razor Bill\r\n(_Alea tarda_), the Woodcock (_Scolopax rusticola_), the Water Hen\r\n(_Gallinula chloropus_) and a few bones of a Limicoline bird, most\r\nlikely a lapwing. We have found the skull, but no more, of the\r\nWhite-tailed or Sea Eagle (_Haliaetus albicilla_). The whole is a\r\nstrangely small collection considering all the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe find in the Fens of course everything of later date, down to the\r\ndrowned animals of last winter's storm, or the stranded pike left when\r\nthe flood went down. It is a curious fact and very like instinct at\r\nfault that in floods the pike wander into shallow water and linger in\r\nthe hollows till too late to get back to the river, so that large\r\nnumbers of them are found dead when the water has soaked in or\r\nevaporated. An old man told me that he well remembered when pike were\r\nmore abundant they used to dig holes along the margin when the flood\r\nwas rising and when it went down commonly found several fine pike in\r\nthem. This explains why we so often find the bones of pike in the peat,\r\nbut where did the pike get into a habit so little conducive to the\r\nsurvival of the species?\r\n\r\nAlthough we notice at the present day a constant change in the\r\nmollusca, their general continuity throughout the long ages from\r\npre-glacial times is a very remarkable fact.\r\n\r\nThe presence of _Corbicula fluminalis_ and _Unio littoralis_ in the\r\nGravels characterized by the cold-climate group of mammals such as\r\n_Rhinoceros tichorhinus_ and _Elephas primigenius_, the absence of\r\nthose shells from the deposits in which _Rh. merckii_ and _E.\r\nantiquus_ are the representative forms, and their existence now\r\nonly in more southern latitudes, as France, Sicily or the Nile, but\r\nnot in our Turbiferous Series, lay before us a series of apparent\r\ninconsistencies not easy of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery step in the line of enquiry we have been following, from whatever\r\npoint of view we have regarded the evidence, has forced upon us the\r\nconclusion that a long interval elapsed between the Areniferous and\r\nTurbiferous series as seen in the Fens; and yet, having regard to the\r\ngeographical history of the area with which we commenced, we cannot but\r\nfeel that the various deposits represent only episodes in a continuous\r\nslow development due to changes of level both here and further afield\r\nand the accidents incidental to denudation.\r\n\r\nBut the particular deposits which we are examining happen to have been\r\nlaid down near sea level where small changes produce great effects. We\r\nmay feel assured that over the adjoining higher ground the changes\r\nwould have been imperceptible when they were occurring and the results\r\nhardly noticeable.\r\n\r\nIf the Fen Beds include nearly the whole of the Neolithic stage the\r\nidea that glacial conditions then prevailed over the adjoining higher\r\nground is quite untenable.\r\n\r\nSo far everything has taught us that the Fens occupy a well-defined\r\nposition in the evolution of the geographical features of East Anglia\r\nand also that the fauna is distinctive, and, having regard to the whole\r\nfacies, quite different from that of the sands and gravels which occur\r\nat various levels all round and pass under the Turbiferous Series of\r\nthe Fens.\r\n\r\nWe will now enquire what is the place of these deposits in the\r\n\"hierarchy\" based upon the remains of man and his handiwork.\r\n\r\nNo Palaeolithic remains have ever been found in the Fen deposits. We\r\nmust not infer from this that there is everywhere evidence of a similar\r\nbreak or long interval of time between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic\r\nages. There are elsewhere remains of man and his handiwork which we\r\nmust refer to later Palaeolithic than anything found in the Areniferous\r\nSeries just near the Fen Beds, and there are, not far off, remains of\r\nman's handiwork which appear to belong to the Neolithic age, but to an\r\nearlier part of it than anything yet found in association with the Fen\r\nBeds.\r\n\r\nThe newer Palaeolithic remains referred to occur chiefly in caves and\r\nthe older Neolithic objects are for the most part transitional forms of\r\nimplement found on the surface in various places around but outside the\r\nFens and in the great manufactures of implements at Cissbury and Grimes\r\nGraves, in which we can study the embryology of Neolithic implements\r\nand observe the development of forms suggested by those of Palaeolithic\r\nage or by nature. The sequence and classification adopted in these\r\ngroups, both those of later Palaeolithic and those of earlier Neolithic\r\nage, are confirmed by an examination of the contemporary fauna; the\r\nAreniferous facies prevailing in the caves and the Turbiferous facies\r\ncharacterising the pits and refuse-heaps of Cissbury and Grimes Graves.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that these ancient flint workings, in which\r\nwe find the best examples of transitional forms, have both of them\r\nsome suggestion of remote age. The pits from which the flint was\r\nprocured at Cissbury are covered by the ramparts of an ancient British\r\ncamp and the ground near Grimes Graves has yielded Palaeolithic\r\nimplements _in situ_ in small rain-wash hollows close by--as seen near\r\n\"Botany Bay.\" Palaeolithic man came into this area sometime after the\r\nuplift of East Anglia out of the Glacial Sea and was here through the\r\nperiod of denudation and formation of river terraces which ensued and\r\nthe age of depression which followed. But Neolithic man belongs to the\r\nlater part of that period of depression when the ends of some of the\r\nriver gravels were again depressed below sea level and the valleys had\r\nscarcely sufficient fall for the rivers to flow freely to the sea. In\r\nthe stagnant swamps and meres thus caused the Fen deposits grew, and\r\nin this time the Shippea man met his death mired in the watery peat of\r\nthe then undrained fens.\r\n\r\nHuman bones have not been very often found in the Fen, and when they do\r\noccur it is not always easy to say whether they really belong to the\r\nage of the peat in which they are found or may not be the remains of\r\nsomeone mired in the bog or drowned in one of the later filled up\r\nditches. That they have long been buried in the peat is often obvious\r\nfrom the colour and condition of the bone. By the kindness of our\r\nfriends Mr and Mrs Luddington my wife and I received early information\r\nof the discovery of human bones in trenching on some of their property\r\nin the Fen close to Shippea Hill near Littleport and we were able to\r\nexamine the section and get some of the bones out of the peat ourselves\r\n(Fig. 6). A deposit of about 4' 6\" of peat with small thin lenticular\r\nbeds of shell marl here rested on lead colored alluvial clay. In the\r\nbase of the peat about four inches above the Buttery Clay a human\r\nskeleton was found bunched up and crowded into a small space, less than\r\ntwo feet square, as if the body had settled down vertically.\r\n\r\n                         _b_\r\n                       +-----+\r\n                      /       \\               [Greek: ph]\r\n       --------------/         \\--------------\r\n    _c_     ···_d_  /           \\  _d´_···    _c_\r\n                   /             \\         +\r\n       -----------/      _a_      \\-----------\r\n    _e_          /                 \\          _e´_\r\n       ---------+-------------------+---------\r\n\r\n    _a._ Kimmeridge Clay forming Shippea Hill, on which monastic\r\n    buildings in connection with Ely Cathedral formerly stood.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Patches of rusty flint gravel.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Peat with bones of beaver, boar, urus, etc.\r\n\r\n    _d._ Shell Marl, occurring in lenticular beds of limited extent in\r\n    the upper part of the peat, sometimes in one bed as at _d_ and\r\n    sometimes in several distinct beds as at _d´_.\r\n\r\n    _e._ \"Buttery Clay\"; full of cockleshells etc. at _e_, but at\r\n    _e´_ containing only freshwater shells and pieces of wood.\r\n\r\n    + Position of skeleton.\r\n\r\n    [Greek: ph] Dressed flint flake on surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Diagram Section across Shippea Hill.]\r\n\r\nSome of the bones were broken and much decayed, while others, when\r\ncarefully extracted, dried and helped out with a little thin glue,\r\nbecame very sound and showed by the surface markings that they had\r\nsuffered only from the moisture and not from any wear in transport.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point about them is the protuberant brow, which,\r\nwhen first seen on the detached frontal bone, before the skull had been\r\nrestored, suggested comparison with that of the Neanderthal man.\r\n\r\nMuch greater importance was attached to that character when the\r\nNeanderthal skull was found.\r\n\r\nWhen I announced the discovery of the Shippea man the point on which I\r\nlaid most stress was that, notwithstanding his protuberant brow, he\r\ncould not possibly be of the _age_ of the deposits to which the\r\nNeanderthal man was referred. I stated \"my own conviction that the peat\r\nin which the Shippea man was found cannot be older than Neolithic times\r\nand may be much newer\" and, believing that similar prominent brow\r\nridges are not uncommon to-day, I suggested that he might be even as\r\nlate as the time of the monks of Ely who had a Retreat on Shippea Hill.\r\n\r\nThe best authorities who have seen the skull since it has been restored\r\nby Mr C. E. Gray, our skilful First Attendant in the Sedgwick Museum,\r\nrefer it to the Bronze Age which falls well within the limits which I\r\nassigned.\r\n\r\nThis skull is unique among the few that I have obtained from the Fens.\r\nDr Duckworth has described[9] most of these, and I subjoin a\r\ndescription of the Shippea man by Professor Alexander Macalister.\r\n\r\n          [9] Duckworth and Shore, _Man_, No. 85, 1911, pp. 134, 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SHIPPEA MAN BY PROF. A. MACALISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The calvaria is large, dark coloured and much broken. The base, facial\r\nbones and part of the left brow ridge and glabella are gone. The\r\nsutures are coarsely toothed and visible superficially although\r\nankylosis has set in in the inner face. The bone is fairly thick (8·10\r\nmm.), and on the inner face the pacchionian pits are large and deep on\r\neach side of the middle line especially in the bregmatic part of the\r\nfrontal and the post-bregmatic part of the parietals. The superior\r\nlongitudinal groove is deep but narrow, and, as far as the broken\r\ncondition allows definite tracing, the cerebral convolution impressions\r\nare of the typical pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n\"The striking feature is the prominent brow ridge due to the large\r\nfrontal sinus. The glabella was probably prominent and the margins on\r\neach side are large and rough and extend outwards to the supraorbital\r\nnotches. The outer part of the supraorbital margin and the processus\r\njugalis are thick, coarse and prominent (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n\"In norma verticalis the skull is ovoid-pentagonoid euryme-topic with\r\nconspicuous rounded parietal eminences, slight flattening at the\r\nobelion and a convex planum interparietale below it (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n\"In norma lateralis the brow ridges are conspicuous; above them is the\r\nsulcus transversus from which the frontal ascends with a fairly uniform\r\ncurve to the bregma. The frontal sagittal arc above the ophryon\r\nmeasures 112 mm. and its chord 116. Behind the bregma the parietals\r\nalong the front half of the sagittal suture have a fairly flat outline\r\nto the medio-parietal region, behind which the flattened obelion is\r\ncontinued downwards with a uniform slope to the middle of the planum\r\ninterparietale whence it probably descended by a much steeper curve to\r\nthe inion, which is lost. The parietal sagittal arc, including the\r\nregion where there was probably a supra-lambdoid ossicle, was about 140\r\nmm. and its chord 121 but the curve is not uniform.\r\n\r\n\"In norma occipitalis the sagittal suture appears at the summit of a\r\nridge whose parietal sides slope outwards forming with each other an\r\nangle of 138°, as far as the parietal eminences. From these the sides\r\ndrop vertically down to the large mastoid processes. The intermastoid\r\nwidth at the tips of the processes is 115, but at the supramastoid\r\ncrest is 148 (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n\"In norma frontalis the conspicuous feature is the brow ridge. This\r\ngives a kind of superficial suggestion of a Neanderthaloid shape, but\r\nthe broad and well arched frontal dispels the illusory likeness. The\r\njugal processes jut out giving a biorbital breadth of 115 mm. while the\r\nleast frontal width is 97 and the bistephanic expands to 125. There is\r\na slight median ridge on the frontal ascending from the ophryon, at\r\nfirst narrow but expanding at the bregma to 50 mm. The surface of this\r\nelevated area is a little smoother than that of the bone on each side\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"The other long bones are mostly broken at their extremities. The\r\nfemora are strong and platymeric. The postero-lateral rounded edge,\r\nwhich bears on its hinder face the insertion of the gluteus maximus,\r\ntaken in connexion with the projection of the thin medial margin of the\r\nshaft below the tuberculum colli inferior causes the upper end of the\r\nshaft to appear flattened. The index of platymeria is ·55. The femoral\r\nlength cannot have been less than 471 mm. The man was probably of\r\nmiddle stature, not a giant as was the Gristhorpe man. The tibiæ are\r\nalso broken at their ends, they are eurycnemic (index ·80) with sharp\r\nsinuous shin and flat back, the length may have been between 335 and\r\n340 mm. The humeri are also bones with strong muscular crests, and the\r\nulnæ are smooth and long. The fibula was channelled. There is nothing\r\nin the bone-features which is inconsistent with the reference of the\r\nskull to the Brachycephalic Bronze Age race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n\"In the following Table are recorded the measurements of the different\r\nregions. The two crania which I have selected to compare with it are\r\n(1) a Round-barrow skull from near Stonehenge (No. 179 in our\r\nCollection) and (2) the Gristhorpe skull, to both of which it bears a\r\nvery strong family likeness.\r\n\r\n                              Shippea  Stonehenge\r\n                               Hill    (No. 179)    Gristhorpe\r\n    Maximal length             194       185           192\r\n    Maximal breadth            153       153           156\r\n    Auricular height           135       132           133\r\n    Biorbital width            115       112           117\r\n    Bistephanic width          128       132           133\r\n    Least frontal width         97       103           106\r\n    Biasterial                 120       127           125\r\n    Auriculo-glabellar radius  116       113           114\r\n    Auriculo-ophryal radius    113       111           105\r\n    Auriculo-metopic radius    134       127           124\r\n    Auriculo-bregmatic radius  137       132           134\r\n    Auriculo-lambdoid radius   104       102           115\r\n    Length and breadth index  78·87     82·7          81·25\r\n\r\n\"The resemblance to the two Round-barrow skulls of the Bronze Age is\r\ntoo great to be accidental, so we may regard this as a representative\r\nof that race, possibly at an earlier stage than the typical form of\r\nwhich the two selected specimens are examples (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n\"The mandible also resembles that of the Gristhorpe skull in general\r\nshape of angle and prominence of chin.\r\n\r\n\"The measurements are as appended:\r\n\r\n                              Shippea  Stonehenge\r\n                               Hill    (No. 179)    Gristhorpe\r\n    Condylo mental length      131        --           130\r\n    Gonio mental length        100        --            99\r\n    Bigoniac                   115        --           116\r\n    Bicondylar                 139        --           141\r\n    Chin height                 32        --            33\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cambridge:\r\n    PRINTED BY JOHN CLAY, M.A.\r\n    AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS",
