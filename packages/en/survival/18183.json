E. CASHMAN, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the forty-ninth annual meeting of the Minnesota State\r\nHorticultural Society. Nearly half a century has elapsed since that\r\nlittle band of pioneers met in Rochester and organized that they might\r\nwork out a problem that had proven too difficult for any of them to\r\nhandle single handed and alone. Those men were all anxious to raise at\r\nleast sufficient fruit for themselves and families. They had tried and\r\nfailed. They were not willing to give up. They knew they could\r\naccomplish more by interchanging ideas, and, furthermore, if they were\r\nable to learn anything by experience they wanted to pass it on to their\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThose men built better than they knew. The foundation was properly laid,\r\nand the structure, while not finished, is an imposing one. A great many\r\npeople believe that this structure has been completed, that we have\r\nreached our possibilities in fruit raising. This is only half true. We\r\nare still building on this splendid foundation erected by those few\r\nenthusiasts.\r\n\r\nNone of those men are left to enjoy the benefits of their labor. The\r\npresent generation and the generations to come are and will be the\r\nbeneficiaries, and I believe as a tribute to their memory and the good\r\nthat they have done that we should fittingly celebrate our fiftieth\r\nanniversary. At this time I can not suggest how this should be done; I\r\nsimply make this suggestion in hopes that it may be worked out.\r\n\r\nI was in hopes that a home for this society might have been erected this\r\nyear or at least made ready for the 1916 meeting. This would surely have\r\nbeen an occasion worthy of the anniversary which we hope to celebrate.\r\n\r\nThe building committee appointed by the last meeting went before the\r\nlegislature and tried with all the eloquence at their command to make\r\nthe members of the legislature see the necessity of appropriating\r\nsufficient money to build a permanent home for this organization. The\r\nmembers saw the force of our argument, but we could not convince a\r\nmajority of the appropriation committee that they should deviate from\r\ntheir plan of retrenchment which seemed to permeate their every act.\r\n\r\nWe were disappointed but not disheartened. We were promised better\r\nsuccess in the 1917 session. So we are living in hopes, and I firmly\r\nbelieve that if our efforts are renewed at that time that this and the\r\nauxiliary societies may have an opportunity of meeting and transacting\r\nbusiness in a home that, while it will belong to the state, will be for\r\nthe use of these organizations, and that we may be able to take up our\r\nabode in it not later than the winter meeting of 1917.\r\n\r\nSecretary Latham has prepared an excellent program for you. Many friends\r\nof this society are with us again, full of enthusiasm and vigor, and I\r\nknow that we will have one of the most successful meetings ever enjoyed\r\nby this organization.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fullness of the program, I should consider it an imposition\r\non my part if I should attempt to make an extended address at this time\r\nand will hasten to call on the gentlemen who are to contribute to the\r\nsuccess of this meeting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New varieties of strawberries originated at the Minnesota\r\nState Fruit-Breeding Farm.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Meeting, 1915, Minnesota State Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nA. W. LATHAM, SECRETARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you attend the 1915 meeting of this association, held in the West\r\nHotel, Minneapolis, four days, December 7-10 inclusive? Of course as a\r\nmember of the society you will get in cold print the substance of the\r\npapers and discussions that were presented at this meeting, but you will\r\nfail altogether in getting the wonderful inspiration that comes from\r\ncontact with hundreds of persons deeply interested in the various phases\r\nof horticultural problems that are constantly passing in review during\r\nthe succeeding sessions of the meeting. With such a varied program there\r\nis hardly any problem connected with horticulture that is not directly\r\nor indirectly touched upon at our annual gathering, and the present\r\nmeeting was no exception to this. In all there were sixty-nine persons\r\non the program, and with the exception of Prof. Whitten, whom we\r\nexpected with us from the Missouri State University, and whom sickness\r\nkept at home, and one other number, every person on the program was on\r\nhand to perform the part assigned to him. Isn't this really a wonderful\r\nthing where so many are concerned, emphasizing as it does the large\r\ninterest felt in the work of the society?\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held in the same room in the West Hotel which was used\r\nfor the banquet two years ago. It seats comfortably 250, and was\r\napproximately filled at all of the sessions of the meeting. At the first\r\nsession there were in attendance about 200 when the meeting opened at\r\nten o'clock Tuesday morning. Later in the morning the seats were\r\npractically all filled. Making allowance for the change in the personnel\r\nof those in attendance at the various meetings, it is easily within the\r\nlimit to say that between 400 and 500 were in attendance at these\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjoining the audience room on the same floor, and opening\r\nout of the spacious balcony, were the various rooms occupied by the\r\nfruit exhibit and the vegetable exhibit. The plant exhibit was in two\r\nalcoves on this balcony, and the cut flowers were displayed along either\r\nside of the balcony, making altogether a wonderful showing of nature's\r\nfloral products. The accommodations for this meeting were almost ideal,\r\nand judging from the expressions of the members we have never been more\r\nhappily situated than on this occasion. I have endeavored to draw a\r\nplan of the arrangements at this meeting and submit it to you, not for\r\ncriticism, but to assist you in understanding the situation.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly disappointed that Prof. Whitten was detained at home by\r\nillness, but others from abroad took up the time so that there was\r\nreally no interim as a result of his absence. We were fortunate in\r\nhaving with us the last day and a part of Thursday afternoon Sen. H.M.\r\nDunlap and Mrs. Dunlap, and their parts on the program were listened to\r\nwith intense interest, and I am sure much good was gained for our\r\nmembership from the service they rendered the society, which it must be\r\nunderstood is a gratuitious one--indeed that applies to all of those\r\nwhose names appear upon the program. That is one good thing about the\r\nhorticulturist, he is willing to tell what he knows for the benefit of\r\nothers. To hold any other view than this would be too narrow and selfish\r\ncertainly for the true lover of horticulture.\r\n\r\nThe exhibits were in every case in excess of what we anticipated.\r\nNotwithstanding the light crop of apples in the larger portion of the\r\nstate, there was really a fine showing, and quality was very high. Of\r\nboxes of apples there were shown eleven, and of barrels of apples six,\r\nfor each one of which exhibits some premium was paid, as besides the\r\nfirst, second and third premiums in each case there was also a sum to be\r\ndivided pro rata. There were twenty-nine pecks of apples exhibited, for\r\nwhich premiums were also paid in the same way. Four collections of\r\ntop-worked apples were on the list. Premiums were awarded to forty\r\nseedling apples, an exceedingly good showing for the season. As to the\r\nnumber of single plates shown the record is not easily available, but\r\nthe accompanying list of awards will give information as far as they are\r\nconcerned, there being of course many plates to which no awards were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable exhibit was an extraordinarily fine one and filled\r\ncomfortably the convenient room assigned for its use. It was excellently\r\nmanaged by Mr. N.H. Reeves, President of the Minneapolis Market\r\nGardeners' Association.\r\n\r\nAs to the flower exhibit under the fine management of W.H. Bofferding,\r\nit was so much better than we anticipated that it is hard to find words\r\nsuitably to express our thought in regard to it. Besides the splendid\r\ncollections of plants and the large display of cut flowers from the\r\nstate, there was shown from several eastern parties rare flowers, many\r\nof them new productions, which had a great deal to do with the\r\nbeautiful appearance of the balcony, where all of these flowers were\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch showing arrangement of hall and adjacent rooms,\r\n&c., used at 1915 Annual Meeting, in West Hotel, Minneapolis.]\r\n\r\nMention ought to be made of the monument erected in the center of the\r\nlobby on the ground floor of the West Hotel, a structure ten feet high,\r\ncontaining at its base some dozen or fifteen single layer boxes of\r\nchoice apples and on its sides something like twenty bushels of apples\r\nput on in varying shades of red and green with a handsome ornamental\r\nplant crowning the whole. The seal of the society decorated with\r\nnational colors appears upon the front. The picture taken of this\r\nmonument is shown as a frontispiece of this number. It is incomplete in\r\nthat the photographer cut off both ends of it, which is unfortunate in\r\nresults obtained. Nevertheless it helped materially to advertise the\r\nmeeting and was a distinct ornament in the lobby.\r\n\r\nAs to subjects in which there was a special interest on our program, the\r\nonly one to which I will here refer is that of \"marketing,\" which\r\nreceived particular attention from a considerable number of those on the\r\nprogram or taking impromptu parts at the meeting. The Ladies' Federation\r\nassisted us splendidly on the Woman's Auxiliary program, one number,\r\nthat by Mrs. Jennison, being beautifully illustrated by lantern slides.\r\n\r\nDelegates from abroad as usual and visitors were with us in considerable\r\nnumber. Prof. F. W. Brodrick came from Winnipeg, representing the\r\nManitoba Society; Prof. N. E. Hansen, as usual, represented the South\r\nDakota Society; Mr. Earl Ferris, of Hampton, Ia., the Northeastern Iowa\r\nSociety; and Mr. A. N. Greaves, from Sturgeon Bay, Wis., the Wisconsin\r\nSociety. We were especially favored in having with us also on this\r\noccasion Mr. N. A. Rasmusson, president of the Wisconsin Horticultural\r\nSociety, and Secretary Frederick Cranefield of the same society. If all\r\nthe members of that society are as wide awake as these three the\r\nMinnesota Society will have to look to its laurels.\r\n\r\nI must not fail to mention Mr. B. G. Street, from Hebron, Ill., who was\r\npresent throughout the meeting, an earnest brother, and gave us a\r\npractical talk on \"marketing.\" Our friend, Chas. F. Gardner, of Osage,\r\nIowa, managed to get here Friday morning after the close of the meeting\r\nof the Iowa Horticultural Society, which he had been attending, and so\r\nspent the last day of the meeting with us. Welcome, Brother Gardner! The\r\nmeeting would certainly have been incomplete without the presence of\r\nthose old veterans and long time attendants at our annual gatherings,\r\nGeo. J. Kellogg and A. J. Philips, both from the Wisconsin Society. We\r\nneed you, dear brothers, and hope you may long foregather with us.\r\n\r\nAs to that war horse of horticulture, C. S. Harrison, of York, Nebr.,\r\nwhat would our meeting be without the fireworks in language which he has\r\nprovided now for many of these annual occasions. The wonderful life and\r\nsparkle of his message survives with us from year to year, and we look\r\nforward eagerly to his annual coming.\r\n\r\nThere were three contestants who spoke from the platform in competition\r\nfor the prizes offered from the Gideon Memorial Fund as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--G. A. Nelson, University Farm School, St. Paul.\r\nSecond--A. W. Aamodt, University Farm School, St. Paul.\r\nThird--P. L. Keene, University Farm School, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nTheir addresses were all of a practical character and will appear in our\r\nmonthly.\r\n\r\nProf. Richard Wellington conducted a fruit judging contest, in\r\nconnection with which there was a large interest, and prizes were\r\nawarded as follows:\r\n\r\nD. C. Webster, La Crescent, First                    $5.00\r\nP. L. Keene, University Farm, St. Paul, Second        3.00\r\nMarshall Hurtig, St. Paul, Third                      2.00\r\n\r\nAt the annual election the old officers whose terms had expired were all\r\nre-elected without opposition, and later the secretary was re-elected by\r\nthe executive board for the coming year, so that no change whatever was\r\nmade in the management of the society. J. M. Underwood, being absent in\r\nthe south, was nevertheless re-elected by the board as its chairman for\r\nthe coming year.\r\n\r\nA pleasant event of this gathering was the presentation of a handsome\r\ngold watch and chain to the secretary, a memento in connection with the\r\ntermination of his twenty-fifth year as secretary of the society, which\r\nexpression of appreciation on the part of the members it may well be\r\nbelieved was fully appreciated by the recipient.\r\n\r\nThe hall was brilliantly decorated with the national colors, which had\r\nnever been used before at any of our annual gatherings. What can be more\r\nbeautiful than the stars and stripes entwined with the colors of foliage\r\nand flower. Never has our place of meeting shown so brightly or been\r\nmore enjoyed than in this favorable environment.\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting upon the recommendation of the executive board there\r\nwere five names by the unanimous vote of the society placed upon the\r\nhonorary life membership roll of the society, as follows: John Bisbee,\r\nMadelia; J. R. Cummins, Minneapolis; Chas. Haralson, Excelsior; F. W.\r\nKimball, Waltham, and S. H. Drum, Owatonna.\r\n\r\nThe meeting closed with seventy-five members in the hall by actual count\r\nat 4:30, and we certainly hated to say the parting word to those whom we\r\nearnestly hope to gather with again a year hence.\r\n\r\nWhat can we say about the crowning event of our meeting, the annual\r\nbanquet? Two hundred and two members sat down together and fraternized\r\nin a most congenial way. Gov. W. S. Hammond was the speaker of the\r\nevening and greatly enjoyed. All the other numbers on the program were\r\non hand to perform their parts. Here follows the program and you can\r\njudge for yourself. Why don't you come and enjoy this most entertaining\r\nevent of the meeting?\r\n\r\nPROGRAM.\r\n\r\nProf. N.E. Hansen, Toastmaster.\r\n\r\nGrace                                       Rev. J.

Don't leave a fire until you are sure it is out; if necessary smother\r\nit with earth or water.\r\n\r\n7. Don't burn brush or refuse in or near the woods if there is any\r\nchance that the fire may spread beyond your control, or that the wind\r\nmay carry sparks where they would start a new fire.\r\n\r\n8. Don't be any more careless with fire in the woods than you are with\r\nfire in your own home.\r\n\r\n9. Don't be idle when you discover a fire in the woods; if you can't put\r\nit out yourself, get help.

Don't forget that human thoughtlessness and negligence are the\r\ncauses of more than half of the forest fires in this country, and that\r\nthe smallest spark may start a conflagration that will result in loss of\r\nlife and destruction of timber and young growth valuable not only for\r\nlumber but for their influence in helping to prevent flood, erosion, and\r\ndrought.--U.S. Dept.

KATZNER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure and satisfaction that we are able to make a material\r\ncorrection of our estimate of this year's apple crop as noted in our\r\nmidsummer report. We stated that apples would be about 15 per cent of a\r\nnormal crop, and now we are happy to say it was fully 30 per cent. We\r\npicked twice as many apples as we anticipated. Considering that, as\r\nProf. Le Roy Cady informed us, the apple crop would be rather small\r\nfarther south and that they would practically get no apples at the State\r\nFarm, we may well be satisfied with our crop. In general, the apple crop\r\nwas not so bad farther north as it was farther south in the state. This\r\nmay have been due to the blossoms not being so far advanced here when\r\nthe frost touched them as farther south.\r\n\r\nThe best bearing varieties this year were the Wealthy, Charlamoff and\r\nDuchess, in the order named. These three kinds gave us the bulk of the\r\ncrop. The Wealthy trees were not overloaded, and the apples were mostly\r\nfine, clean and large. The Charlamoffs were bearing a heavy crop of\r\nbeautiful, large-sized apples and were ahead of the Duchess this year.\r\nThe Hibernals, too, were fairly good bearers. Most other varieties had\r\nsome fruit, but it was not perfect; it showed only too well the effect\r\nof frost. More than half of the blossoms were destroyed. Many flowers\r\nwere badly injured and though they were setting fruit the result of\r\nfrost showed off plainly on the apples. While some had normal size and\r\nform, many of them were below size, gnarled, cracked or undeveloped and\r\nabnormal. Most all of them had rough blotches or rings about the calix\r\nor around the body. Malformed apples were picked not larger than a crab,\r\nwith rough, cracked, leather-like skin, which looked more like a black\r\nwalnut than an apple.\r\n\r\nOf plums only some young trees gave us a good crop of nice, perfect\r\nfruit. The old trees have seen their best days and will have to give\r\nplace to the new kinds as soon as they are tested. We have quite a\r\nvariety of the new kinds on trial from the Minnesota State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm and wish to say that they are very vigorous growers.\r\nMany of them made a growth of four feet and more. We expect that some\r\nwill bear next year and we are only waiting to see what the fruit will\r\nbe before making a selection for a new plum orchard. We have already\r\nselected No. 8 for that purpose, as one tree was bearing most beautiful\r\nand excellent plums, of large size and superior quality, this year. They\r\nwere one and three-fourths inches long by five and one-half inches in\r\ncircumference and weighed two ounces each. They kept more than week\r\nbefore they got too soft for handling and are better than many a\r\nCalifornia plum. It seems to us if a man had ten acres of these plum\r\ntrees, he could make a fortune out of them. We will propagate only the\r\nvery best kinds for our own use and may have more to say about them\r\nanother year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cluster of Alpha grapes from Collegeville.]\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the imported pears bloomed again last spring, but the\r\nfrost was too severe and they set no fruit. We have lost all interest in\r\nthem and so, too, in our German seedling pears. The latter are now used\r\nas stocks and are being grafted with Chinese and hybrid pears. Of those\r\nalready grafted this way some have made a growth of four and five feet.\r\nWe have been successful in grafting the six varieties of hybrid pears\r\nobtained last spring from Prof. N.E. Hansen, of Brookings, S. Dak., and\r\nhave trees of every variety growing. These, too, are very good growers,\r\nhave fine large leaves and are promising. From the manner of growth in\r\nstem and leaf we would judge that at least two distinct Asiatic\r\nvarieties have been used in breeding. We have gathered a little grafting\r\nwood and next spring some more German seedlings will lose their tops. It\r\nis only from continued efforts that success may be obtained in growing\r\npears in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought it possible that in spite of all the frost and\r\ncold rains we would get a pretty good crop of cherries? And yet this is\r\na fact. We have four varieties, and among them is one originated by the\r\nlate Clem. Schmidt, of Springfield, Minn., which was bearing a good crop\r\nof very fine cherries while the three other sorts did not do a thing. To\r\nget ahead of the many birds we picked the cherries a few days before\r\nthey were ripe and put them up in thirty-two half-gallon jars. As the\r\ncherries become very soft when dead-ripe, it was of advantage to can\r\nthem when they were still hard. These canned cherries are meaty and most\r\ndelicious. We never tasted any better. It is only a pity that this\r\nseedling cherry is not quite hardy.\r\n\r\nAs most everywhere in the state, our grapes were a complete failure. The\r\nearly growth with its good showing of fruit having been frozen in May,\r\nit was well toward the end of June when the vines had recovered from the\r\nshock and were able to grow vigorously again. There were a few grapes on\r\nsome of the vines, but they never got ripe. The Alpha showed the most\r\nfruit, and a few bunches were just about getting ripe when the frost\r\nspoiled them. This May freeze was more severe than we thought it was.\r\nThe wood of the old vines was not injured, but the one year old wood of\r\nyoung plants was killed to the ground. The lesson we learned from this\r\nis very important. It may be stated that vines full of sap and in\r\ngrowing condition can endure very little cold, but when the wood is ripe\r\nand dormant the vines will seldom be injured by sub-zero weather. This\r\ninjury to vines from frost might have been averted at least in part by\r\nprecautionary measures. In other countries people start smoldering\r\nfires, making much smoke in the vineyard so that the whole is covered\r\nwith a cloud of smoke. This raises the temperature a few degrees and\r\nkeeps the frost out. Such preventive means might have been used here\r\nvery well to save the grapes, but it was not done.\r\n\r\nOur currants were not very good; they ripened unevenly and showed that\r\nthey, too, were touched by frost. A few bushes were also attacked by the\r\ncurrant worm.\r\n\r\nWe never cultivated any raspberries before. But last year we planted\r\nRaspberry No. 8, sent to us from the Fruit-Breeding Farm. This sort is a\r\nvery vigorous grower; some canes grew over six feet high. It fruited\r\nthis year; it is very prolific; the fruit is very large and of good\r\nquality. It would be quite satisfactory if it were a little hardier.\r\nNot being protected more than half of the plants were lost last winter.\r\n\r\nBut the everbearing strawberry No. 1017 received from the Fruit-Breeding\r\nFarm is a complete success. They were properly planted and well taken\r\ncare of. All flowers were removed up to July 10th and then left alone.\r\nIn early August the first berries were picked, and we kept right on\r\npicking till the frost killed the fruit stalks. The growing of this\r\nstrawberry will be continued. A new bed will be planted next spring with\r\nyoung plants that were not allowed to bear last season. The fruit was\r\nall that could be desired, fine, large and of very good quality. It\r\nseems to be of greater advantage to grow the everbearing than the\r\nJune-bearing sorts. The everbearing planted in spring will grow a large\r\ncrop in fall and bear again in June next year. From the first we get two\r\ncrops in fifteen months, from the second two crops in three years. And\r\nto fruit any sort oftener than two seasons is not considered very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nMost all trees of apples, pears, plums, evergreens and grafts which were\r\nplanted last spring, have done very well, and we don't know of any that\r\nfailed to grow. The hybrid plums received last spring are all alive. The\r\nsame may be said of the 50 Norway pine obtained from the Minnesota State\r\nForester, W. F. Cox, not one failing to grow. If evergreens are handled\r\nright in transplanting they are just as sure to grow as any other trees.\r\nThis year was especially favorable for transplanting on account of the\r\nmany rains and cool weather.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was the kind of weather which pleased our vegetable gardener.\r\nHe found it scarcely ever necessary throughout the season to apply water\r\nto the growing plants for their best development. All grew fine and\r\nlarge. Cabbage heads were grown that weighed thirty-five pounds;\r\ncarrots, onions, beets, lettuce and in fact all the different varieties\r\nwere first-class. Yet there was something that did not please the\r\ngardener nor ourselves, namely, the tomatoes did not get ripe. We had a\r\nfew early kinds all right, but the bulk, the large, fine varieties, were\r\nhanging on the vines still green when the first heavy frost touched\r\nthem. It was too cool for them to ripen. The same may be said of the\r\nmelons. Not once did we have melons at table this year. They were too\r\npoor to be served.\r\n\r\nOur floral plantings were a great success. The many artistic foliage\r\ndesigns developed wonderfully and were the admiration of all visitors.\r\nOur peonies were a mass of exceedingly beautiful flowers, filling the\r\nair with fragrance as of roses. We are not surprised that these flowers\r\nhave gained so much popularity of late, for their great beauty and ease\r\nof culture recommend them to all lovers of flowers. The dahlias, too,\r\nwere very excellent; in fact, we never saw them better. They are quite\r\nornamental in flower and plant. The newer varieties have exceptionally\r\nlarge flowers, but the plants do not show off so well and bend down from\r\nthe weight of the flowers. For symmetry and uniformity of growth the old\r\nvarieties are hard to be excelled. Some of the roses were not so good as\r\ndesired, the buds got too much rain at times and rotted away. The mock\r\noranges, syringas and others were all very good, but the spireas\r\nsuffered much when in flower from rains. As a whole, however, our lawns\r\nand grounds were beautiful and satisfactory and the new greenhouse has\r\ndone good work.\r\n\r\nThe growing of fruit this year has been a disappointment to many\r\nhorticulturists. Indeed, some got quite a showing of fruit in favored\r\nlocalities, but the majority got not much of a crop to be proud of.\r\nWell, we cannot regulate the weather conditions, but we are pleased with\r\nthe thought that such abnormal conditions are not of frequent occurrence\r\nin Minnesota. Yet there is one redeeming feature of the season and that\r\nis, the wonderful growth of plants and trees which gives promise that\r\nwith the usual normal conditions our expectations for a better fruit\r\ncrop will be realized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTORING CABBAGE IN THE FIELD.--In choosing a site for a storage\r\npit, select a ridge, well drained and as gravelly a soil as possible.\r\nThe pit should be 6 to 10 inches deep, the length and width depending\r\nupon the amount to be stored. It is well to have it wide enough to\r\naccommodate 3 to 5 heads on the bottom row.\r\n\r\nIn harvesting the heads, pull up by the roots. Break off only the dead\r\nor diseased leaves, and fold the remaining leaves over the head as much\r\nas possible to protect them. Overripe or cracked heads should not be\r\nstored. The heads are placed in the pit with their heads down and roots\r\nup. The second layer is also placed heads down between the roots of the\r\nfirst layer. It is well not to have more than two layers, on account of\r\nthe weight having a tendency to crush the lower layer.\r\n\r\nWhen the cabbages are put in place they are covered with a layer of\r\nearth. When cold weather comes, straw or manure can be added.\r\n\r\nCabbages can often be kept better in pits than in common cellars.--E.

PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter losses of bees in Minnesota are great every year. Bee keepers\r\ncan reduce these losses by preparing bees for their winter-quarters.\r\n\r\nThe chief known cause for winter losses are: Queenlessness, smallness of\r\nnumber of bees in colonies, insufficient food, improper food, dampness,\r\nbad air, the breaking of the clusters, and low temperature.\r\n\r\nMore colonies die from lack of food and from cold than from all other\r\ncauses. In fact, most of the other causes can be traced to lack of food\r\nand cold.\r\n\r\nQueenless colonies will certainly die in a few months.\r\n\r\nIf the number of bees in a colony is small the clusters cannot generate\r\nenough heat or keep it generated and the bees will perish. To avoid\r\nthis, small colonies should be united in the fall into one big colony.\r\n\r\nBees must have food in the winter in order to generate heat. About forty\r\npounds of honey to the colony should be provided when the bees are put\r\ninto winter-quarters. Should the colony be short of honey of its own,\r\nfinished frames may be supplied early in the fall or sugar syrup may be\r\nfed. Bee keepers should keep about one well filled extracting frame out\r\nof every seven for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\nDark (not amber) honey is poor food for bees in winter. All black honey\r\nshould be removed and combs of white honey should be substituted.\r\nExperiments made by Dr. Phillips, in Washington, D. C., have shown that\r\nbees consume least honey and winter best when the temperature inside the\r\nhive is 57 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nDampness in a cellar causes the comb and frames of the hive walls and\r\ncover to get damp and mouldy, and the bees perish from wet and cold\r\nafter exhausting their vitality in generating heat.\r\n\r\nBees need fresh air. Foul air will cause excitement, causing an\r\noverheated condition; and the bees will scatter and die. Any excitement\r\namong bees in winter is fatal. Cellars on high ground, covered with\r\nstraw over timbers, are best for wintering bees.\r\n\r\nIf the bee cluster divides or splits up during the winter, the smaller\r\nclusters will perish from cold. The present style of Hoffman frames\r\ndivides the bee cluster into eleven divisions separated from each other\r\nby a sheet of wax comb, with no direct communication between different\r\ndivisions except over, below or around the frames. If the bee cluster\r\ncontracts during the winter on account of cold the divisions of the\r\noutside frames are sometimes left behind and die. Some bee keepers\r\nperforate their frames to keep an easy passage for bees from one\r\ncompartment to another. If kept warm, even weak colonies may pass over\r\nor around the frames without much difficulty. When cold, only the\r\nstrongest will be able to accomplish this difficult task. Wintering\r\nbees in division hives or in two story hives, which give them a\r\nhorizontal bee space through the middle between the two divisions, is\r\nhighly recommended for successful wintering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis Jager, Professor of Apiculture, University Farm,\r\nSt. Paul.]\r\n\r\nIn long-continued severe cold the bee clusters will contract into a very\r\nsmall, compact mass. The tendency of this cluster is to move upward\r\nwhere the air is warmer. If enough honey is stored above them they will\r\nkeep in contact with it. If the honey is stored at the side, the bees\r\nsometimes lose their contact with it and die of starvation and cold.\r\nThis is another argument in favor of wintering in two story hives. Often\r\nthey will move towards one corner and die there, leaving the other\r\ncorners filled with honey. If you must winter in one story hives give\r\nbees plenty of honey in the fall and place the cluster at one side of\r\nthe hive so that they move necessarily toward the honey supply.\r\n\r\nBees should be kept in a cellar at a temperature of about 45 degrees.\r\nThe difference in the temperature between the outside and the inside of\r\nthe hive will be between 10 and 15 degrees. Very strong colonies, no\r\nmatter where kept, will keep themselves warm and will survive any degree\r\nof cold, but there is no doubt that their vitality and ability to stand\r\nwintering will suffer a great deal thereby, causing dwindling in the\r\nspring. Cellar wintering is at present general in Minnesota. The bee\r\ncellar should be warm, dry, dark and ventilated. The bees should not be\r\ndisturbed during their winter sleep by pounding, jarring, shaking and\r\nfeeding. Mice also may cause the bees to get excited and perish. A four\r\nto one inch wire screen in front of the entrance will prevent mice from\r\ngetting inside.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principles to guide the bee keeper in wintering his bees\r\nare: First, strong colonies, at least six frames covered with bees when\r\nclustered; second, ample store, not less than forty pounds of honey; and\r\nthird, a hive with not less than 57 degrees inside temperature. This\r\ntemperature may be maintained outside in a double walled hive or in a\r\nhive lined with flax or felt, now manufactured for that purpose, or by\r\npacking the hives in leaves, straw or shavings--or by putting them into\r\na warm cellar.\r\n\r\nBees in our climate should be put into winter quarters about November 15\r\nand should not be put on their summer stands in the spring until soft\r\nmaples are in bloom.\r\n\r\nBy following these suggestions winter losses may be reduced to an\r\ninsignificant percentage, and these mostly from accidents and causes\r\nunforseen, for bees respond wonderfully to proper treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Currant as a Market Garden Product.\r\n\r\nB. WALLNER, JR., WEST ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe currant is essentially a northern fruit, therefore does well in\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nI plant my currants on a clay loam as it retains moisture and coolness,\r\nwhich the currant prefers. Their roots run somewhat shallow, and hence\r\nsandy or friable soils are not desirable. Soils such as will prevent a\r\nstagnant condition during heavy rainfalls are essential. I plant my\r\ncurrants early in spring as soon as the frost leaves the ground and a\r\nproper preparation can be secured. I plant them five by five feet apart,\r\nas they require a thorough cultivation the first two years from\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nI plant mangels between the rows the first year; second year continued\r\ncultivation is practiced; third year I apply a mulch consisting of\r\nmushroom manure to a depth of from four to six inches, which answers a\r\ndouble purpose, to keep out weeds and to act as mulch at the same time.\r\nDuring a prolonged dry spell the soil is moist under this covering, and\r\nit makes it more pleasant for the picking, as it prevents the berries\r\ngetting soiled after a rain during the picking season. You cannot\r\nfertilize the currant too abundantly, as it is a gross feeder and\r\nrequires plenty of manure to get best results, as such fruit commands\r\nthe best price on the market.\r\n\r\nI planted my currants on ground previously well fertilized with well\r\ndecayed barnyard manure.\r\n\r\nI prefer strong well rooted two-year-old plants. The long straggling\r\nroots are shortened, and bruised portions cut off with a sharp knife.\r\nThe tops are somewhat reduced, depending on the size of plants. I set\r\nthem in a furrow, sufficiently deep to admit the roots to spread out in\r\na natural position, fill in with surface soil and pack around the roots,\r\nso that when the earth is firmly settled the roots will not protrude out\r\nany place.\r\n\r\nIn regard to pruning I find the best and largest fruit is produced on\r\ncanes not over four years old, and if judicious cutting out of the old\r\ncanes is followed nice, large, full clusters of fruit of excellent\r\ncharacter will be obtained. This is a fact that I want to emphasize: if\r\nthe market is glutted with currants, you can readily dispose of your\r\nproduct, providing they are qualified as extra large, which results can\r\nbe attained by following these rules.\r\n\r\nPertaining to insects and diseases, I spray my currants twice for the\r\ncurrant worm with arsenate of lead at the rate of two pounds to fifty\r\ngallons of water.\r\n\r\nI also use hellebore (dry powdered form), especially valuable in\r\ndestroying the worms when berries are almost ready for market, and on\r\nwhich it is dangerous to use arsenical poisons. I never was troubled\r\nwith the currant worm cane borer. I attribute the absence of this\r\ndreaded insect to my keeping all old wood cut out, which is generally\r\ninfested with it.\r\n\r\nAs to varieties I planted the following: Wilder, Victoria, Prince\r\nAlbert, Red Cross, Diploma and White Grape. The Wilder is the best\r\ncommercial berry, very productive and large, while the Diploma is one of\r\nthe largest fruited varieties in existence, its main drawback consisting\r\nof a straggling habit of growth which requires either tying up the\r\nbranches or pruning back somewhat short.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Albert is late and can be recommended for commercial use.\r\nVictoria is a prolific bearer, fair size fruit and requires little\r\npruning. Red Cross is large fruited, but shy bearer. The White Grape\r\nmeets with little demand as a market berry, fine to eat out of hand and\r\nan excellent table berry.\r\n\r\nI also planted a few Black Champion; have not grown it long enough to\r\nknow definite results.\r\n\r\nThe demand for black currants is limited, but the prices are fair. As to\r\npicking would say we pick them when not quite ripe, as the average\r\nhousewife claims they jell better than when over-ripe. They must be\r\npicked by the stem and not stripped off--all defective, over-ripe and\r\nbruised berries should be eliminated at the picking.\r\n\r\nWhen the box is being filled a few gentle raps should be given to settle\r\nthe clusters into place, as they shake down considerably. All the\r\nconveniences and same character of boxes and crates used in handling of\r\nother small fruits are equally adapted to the currant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWELCOME THE THRUSHES--THESE BIRDS DO THE FARMER LITTLE HARM AND MUCH\r\nGOOD.--That thrushes--the group of birds in which are included\r\nrobins and bluebirds--do a great deal of good and very little harm to\r\nagriculture is the conclusion reached by investigators of the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture who have carefully studied the food\r\nhabits of these birds. Altogether there are within the limits of the\r\nUnited States eleven species of thrushes, five of which are commonly\r\nknown as robins and bluebirds. The other six include the Townsend\r\nsolitaire, the wood, the veery, the gray-cheek, the olive-back, and the\r\nhermit thrushes.--U.S. Dept. of Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of Committee on Examination of Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding\r\nFarm for the Year 1915.\r\n\r\nDR. O. M. HUESTIS, MINNEAPOLIS; FRANK H. GIBBS, ST. ANTHONY PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 12, 1915, your committee visited the State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm, was met at the Zumbra Heights Station, on the M. &\r\nSt. Louis R.R., by Superintendent Haralson and were very soon in the\r\nmidst of a plat of over 3,000 everbearing strawberry plants all\r\ndifferent--some plants with scores of ripe and green berries as well as\r\nblossoms, others with few berries and many runners. The superintendent\r\nhad already made selections and marked some 250 plants for propagation.\r\nIn another plat of 1,000 varieties it was very apparent that No. 1017, a\r\ncross between Pan-American and Dunlap, was the superior, although others\r\nwere choice, both as plant makers and fruit-bearers. No doubt many\r\nexcellent kinds will come from those selected. It certainly was\r\nencouraging to be able, even after the heavy frost of a week before, to\r\npick three quarts of large, well ripened berries, a photo of which we\r\nobtained on reaching the city and will appear in the Horticulturist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Field of No. 3 June-bearing strawberries at State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm.]\r\n\r\nOf the June-bearing varieties No. 3, a cross between Senator Dunlap and\r\nPocomoke, would seem to surpass anything else we saw as to strength of\r\nplant and health of foliage. As to its fruiting ability, will refer to\r\nthe display made at the last summer meeting of the society, which was so\r\nmuch admired. We have no doubt there is a great future for No. 3, as has\r\nbeen for its illustrious parent, the Dunlap. Next we went over to the\r\nraspberry field containing, it seemed, thousands of strong, straight,\r\nhealthy plants, which would have to be seen to be appreciated and only\r\nthen when in fruiting. No. 4 took our special attention. The canes were\r\nespecially clean, well branched and healthy--a cross between Loudon and\r\nKing. Many others seem to be very promising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Everbearing strawberries, No. 1017. Minnesota State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm. Gathered October 12, 1915.]\r\n\r\nNext we were shown a variety of everbearing raspberry from which we\r\nindulged in ripe fruit of good size and flavor and which it is hoped\r\nwill be as valuable as the everbearing strawberry. Of the thousands of\r\neverbearing seedlings selections had been made of about 100 which were\r\nfine looking plants, well cultivated and free from disease.\r\n\r\nWe were then shown some hundreds of wild peach seedlings, seedlings of\r\nBurbank plums, thousands of hybrid plums of all ages, and a plat of\r\nthousands of plum seedlings which will be disposed of to nurserymen this\r\nfall and bring a nice income to the state; also wild pears from\r\nManchuria with good prospects of being hardy and free from blight.\r\n\r\nWe saw a number of nice plum trees, of which the superintendent told us\r\nthe fruit would color before ripening and would stand long shipments,\r\nwhich so far promise well. Several hundred Beta grape seedlings probably\r\neven more hardy than the parent, many crosses in roses which if judged\r\nby the foliage must be seen in bloom to be appreciated, seedlings of\r\nCompass cherry crossed with apricot; Compass cherry crossed with\r\nnectarines; seedling currants, over 2,000 from which to select the best.\r\nOver a hundred commercial varieties of apples from East and West, and\r\nover 200 varieties of peaches from China and Manchuria, walnuts,\r\nbutternuts and many dwarf apple trees on Paradise stocks, which fruit\r\nearly. A good field of corn in shock, for feed for the horses. The old\r\norchard on the place when bought, which had been top-worked to some\r\nextent, looked healthy everywhere. The farm seemed to be free from\r\nnoxious woods, free from pocket gophers or moles and well cultivated, we\r\nthought, for the small number of men employed. Machinery and tools were\r\nwell housed. We were also pleased to be shown through the new home of\r\nthe superintendent, not yet occupied, which seemed to be complete in all\r\nits appointments.\r\n\r\nWe think the state has a great asset in the farm and recommend that as\r\nfar as possible members of this society visit it during the coming\r\nsummer and that the society use its influence with the Board of Regents\r\nthat more land be procured as soon as possible in order that trial\r\nplants may remain longer to more definitely prove their worth and that a\r\ngreater work may be done for the state. We notice in a report made just\r\nsix years before, viz., October 12, 1909, by Brothers Wedge, Underwood\r\nand the then president of the society, Prof. Green, that even runnerless\r\neverbearing strawberries were represented and that they had the usual\r\npleasure of picking strawberry blossoms in October. Had they been with\r\nus they would have had a large dish of No. 1017 covered with rich cream\r\nand served at the hand of Mrs. Haralson.\r\n\r\nMr. C. S. Harrison: Mr. Chairman, I think the slogan of this society\r\nshould be \"Urbanize the country and ruralize the town.\" I see tremendous\r\nchanges going on all the while. Can you think of the possibilities of\r\nMinnesota? About 40 per cent of the land under cultivation and that half\r\nworked. By and by there is going to be a crop of boys who will raise\r\nseventy-five to 100 bushels of corn to the acre where their dads raised\r\ntwenty-five. You got to keep out of their way, you got to help them\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing Fruit by Association.\r\n\r\nA. N. GRAY, MGR. BAY LAKE FRUIT GROWERS' ASSN., DEERWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing fruit or any farm product by association is the modern\r\nfarmer's insurance of results.\r\n\r\nA great deal might be said on this subject, but I shall tell you briefly\r\nwhat the Bay Lake Fruit Growers' Association have accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe first raspberry growing for market at Bay Lake was back in 1886.\r\nNick Newgard, one of our first settlers, sold quite a few berries that\r\nyear. Bay Lake is seven miles from Deerwood, the nearest railroad point,\r\nand at that time there was only a trail between these places, and it was\r\nnecessary for Mr. Newgard to pack his berries in on his back. This same\r\nmethod was used in transporting supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strawberry field on place of A. N. Gray, at Bay Lake.]\r\n\r\nMr. Newgard told me recently that he received a very good profit on his\r\nberries the first ten years, but each year the acreage increased and\r\neach year the growers' troubles increased in disposing of the crop.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 there was an unusually large crop and, shipping individually, as\r\nwe did at that time, it was a case of all shipments going to Duluth one\r\nday, flooding the market, then the next day every one shipping to Fargo\r\nand flooding that market, and at the end of the season when the growers\r\nreceived their final returns they found that they had received very\r\nsmall pay for their berries.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year the growers around Bay Lake called a meeting to\r\nsee if some organization could not be formed to handle their berries\r\nand look after the collections. The result of this meeting was the\r\nincorporation of the Bay Lake Fruit Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nWhen the berry season opened in 1910 we had a manager, hired for the\r\nseason, on a salary, who worked under a board of five managing\r\ndirectors. It was the manager's business to receive the berries at the\r\nstation, find a market for them, make the collections and settlements\r\nwith the growers. The result of this first year was so satisfactory to\r\nthe members that the total membership increased that fall to almost 100.\r\nThis new system had eliminated all the worry, and we received a good\r\nprice for our berries after the expense of our manager had been\r\ndeducted.\r\n\r\nWe have just closed our sixth season, which by the way has been a very\r\nsuccessful one, as the prices received have been above the average. We\r\nnow have about 150 members, and we have two shipping stations, Deerwood\r\nand Aitkin. We market strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants,\r\ngooseberries, plums, Compass cherries, apples, sweet corn and celery.\r\n\r\nWe have a nice trade worked up and have little trouble in finding a\r\nready market for any of our products.\r\n\r\nIt is our aim, as growers, to give our customers all A No. 1 quality.\r\nDuring the berry season we have an inspector whose duty it is to inspect\r\nthe berries as they arrive at the station and any found to be of poor\r\nquality we dispose of locally for canning. The grower of these berries\r\nreceives a credit for the amount we realize. In this way we keep the\r\nstandard of our berries up, and we have very few complaints from our\r\ncustomers on soft berries.\r\n\r\nAs for losses on bad debts, we have thus far had very few. We usually\r\nget a credit rating from the prospective customer's bank and ship to him\r\naccordingly. Our old customers file standing orders with us to ship them\r\nso many crates each day, and each year brings us new customers who have\r\nheard of the fine Bay Lake berries.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the association built a potato warehouse at a cost of about\r\n$2,500, and we store the members' potatoes for them at a nominal cost.\r\nIn 1914 the association decided to put in a stock of flour and feed and\r\nkeep the manager the year around. Our business in this line has been\r\nincreasing all the time. It is very interesting to note that over 60 per\r\ncent of our flour and feed customers are not members of the association.\r\n\r\nWe are growing all the time and branching out. A few months ago we added\r\na small stock of hardware and some groceries, and these have taken so\r\nwell that we would not be at all surprised if eventually we find\r\nourselves in the retail store business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvergreens for Both Utility and Ornament.\r\n\r\nEARL FERRIS, NURSERYMAN, HAMPTON, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as horticulture is concerned, the only touch of color on the\r\nNorthwestern landscape during the coming winter will be furnished by the\r\ngreens and blues of evergreens.\r\n\r\nDid you ever pass a farm home in the winter that was protected by a good\r\nevergreen grove and notice how beautiful it looked? Did you ever stop to\r\nthink of the difference in temperature that an evergreen grove makes, to\r\nsay nothing of the contrast in the appearance of the place to that of a\r\nhome with no grove?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A shelter of old Scotch pine at Mr. Earl Ferris'.]\r\n\r\nWhen I was a small boy I was fortunate enough to be raised on a farm in\r\nButler County, Iowa, that was well protected by a good Norway spruce,\r\nwhite pine and Scotch pine windbreak. The Norway spruce and white pine\r\nare still there and if anything better than they were thirty years ago.\r\nAt that time my father fed from one to five carloads of stock every\r\nwinter back of this grove, and I honestly believe that he fed his steers\r\nat a cost of from $5 to $15 per steer less than a neighboring feeder who\r\nfed out on the open prairie with a few sheds to furnish the only winter\r\nprotection. I shall never forget the remark a German made who was\r\nhauling corn to us one cold winter day. As he drove onto the scales back\r\nof this grove, he straightened up and said: \"Well, the evergreen grove\r\nfeels like putting on a fur coat,\" and I never heard the difference in\r\ntemperature described any better. Our evergreen grove moved our feeding\r\npens at least 300 miles further south every winter, as far as the cold\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thrifty windbreak of Norway spruce at Mr. Earl Ferris'\r\nplace, in Hampton, Ia.]\r\n\r\nNear Hampton, Iowa, we have three or four of the best stock raisers in\r\nthe United States. Every one of them is feeding cattle back of a large\r\nevergreen grove. In recent years they have divided up some of their\r\nlarge farms into smaller places and made new feeding sheds, and the\r\nfirst improvement that they made on each and every one of these places\r\nwas an evergreen grove. They buy the best trees that can be obtained\r\nthat have been transplanted and root pruned, and most of them prefer the\r\nNorway spruce in the two to three foot size. After planting, they take\r\nas good care of them as they do of any crop on the farm, for they fully\r\nrealize that cultivation is an all important thing in getting a good\r\nevergreen grove started.\r\n\r\nSeveral days ago, I talked with one of these feeders who has time and\r\nagain topped the Chicago market. He made the remark that the buildings\r\non his farm cost thousands of dollars while his evergreen grove had only\r\ncost from $100 to $200, but that he would rather have every building on\r\nthe place destroyed than to lose that windbreak.\r\n\r\nAs the price of land and feed increases, the farmers of the Northwest\r\nare waking up to the fact that an evergreen grove is an absolute\r\nnecessity, and that they cannot afford to plant any other. The maple,\r\nwillow, box elder and other similar trees take so much land that they\r\ncannot afford them. They are a windbreak in the summer, but a joke in\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nThe time is not far distant when every up-to-date farmer in Minnesota,\r\nIowa, Nebraska and other Northwest states will have a good evergreen\r\ngrove which will be considered as much of a necessity as his barn, house\r\nor other outbuildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Evergreens adorn old home of Otto Kankel, at Fertile,\r\nMinn., in Red River Valley.]\r\n\r\nLate this fall, my wife and I left Hampton for an automobile trip\r\nthrough Minnesota, North Dakota and into Canada. It seemed to me on this\r\ntrip that the most beautiful thing we saw about the farm buildings were\r\nthe evergreen groves that many of the farmers now have all through\r\nMinnesota and Dakota. I was certainly very much surprised at some of\r\nthese windbreaks and at some of the varieties of evergreens that were\r\nbeing grown successfully as far north as Fargo. Near Fargo we found some\r\nextra good specimens of Norway spruce, which I consider the best of all\r\nwindbreak makers. We also found the Scotch pine doing well 100 miles\r\nnorthwest of Fargo, and other varieties which were naturally to be\r\nexpected being planted to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nAs far as usefulness is concerned, the farmer of the prairie states is\r\nbound to get more real value from an evergreen than any other person,\r\nbut I am very glad to say that the homes of the wealthy in the cities\r\neach season are being improved more and more by the planting of the more\r\nornamental evergreens. Cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston,\r\nSt. Paul, Minneapolis, and other large cities of the United States are\r\nusing thousands of evergreens every season to beautify the homes, of not\r\nonly the wealthy but of the laboring man also. The price of evergreens\r\nat the present time is within the reach of everyone owning a home, and\r\nthere is no other improvement that can be placed upon a piece of ground\r\nat so little expense and so little labor that will add so many dollars\r\nin real value to that property as will the evergreen, either as a\r\nwindbreak or in landscape work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Executive Board.\r\n\r\nJ. M. UNDERWOOD, CHAIRMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report of the executive board is necessarily brief from the fact\r\nthat the machinery of our society is kept in such excellent condition by\r\nour secretary, that there is little left for our board to do. His\r\nmonthly issues of the \"Horticulturist\" keep the membership posted on all\r\nimportant items of interest and are a splendid examplification to the\r\npublic of the value of our publications and of the meetings of our\r\nsociety. Your executive board meets twice a year to verify the accounts\r\nof the secretary and treasurer and at other times when there is\r\nsomething of importance to attend to.\r\n\r\nWe wish to call your attention to the fact that your board is\r\npractically self supporting. The members work for nothing and board\r\nthemselves, which is a mighty good way to do.\r\n\r\nThere is a work of very great importance for the _members_ of our\r\nsociety to do the coming year. That is to help in every legitimate way\r\nto _secure an appropriation_ by the next legislature with which to build\r\nfor our society a _home_. We should have had it provided so that we\r\ncould celebrate our semi-centennial a year from now in our own home. If\r\nwe were a private society, we would have had a home years ago.\r\n\r\nWe should be closely affiliated with the horticulture of the State\r\nUniversity. Our home should be located on the grounds of the\r\nAgricultural College, where the building could be used for other\r\npurposes when not needed by our society. Let every member of our society\r\ninterview the senator and member of the house from his or her district\r\nnext fall and secure their promise to support a bill to appropriate\r\n$50,000 for building us a home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report of Treasurer, 1915.\r\n\r\nGEO.

Iowa Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nC. E. SNYDER, PRESTON, DELEGATE\r\n\r\n\r\nYour delegate arrived at Decorah at nine-thirty, Wednesday, November\r\nseventeenth. Full accommodations offered by the Winneshiek Hotel made\r\nthe trip complete and homelike to delegates and members.\r\n\r\nThe convention was held in the old Marsh Hall, a very suitable place,\r\noffering ample room with all necessary accommodations for such a\r\ngathering.\r\n\r\nDecorations showed much time and skill, resulting in a beautiful display\r\nof shrubbery-boughs, evergreen, etc.\r\n\r\nThe area of a table about one hundred feet long and six feet wide,\r\nrunning through the center of the hall, contained a great variety of\r\napples surprising for this season. Many, including C.H. True, of Clayton\r\ncounty, proved themselves successful orchardists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. C. E. Snyder, Preston.]\r\n\r\nOn various other tables large displays of agriculture, apiary,\r\ngreenhouse and garden products completed the harmonizing of\r\nhorticulture, floriculture and agriculture, including mentioned\r\ndecorations appearing as a striking feature and an encouragement to the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called to order shortly after ten o'clock by President\r\nGeo. S. Woodruff. The mingling of many instructive papers with humorous\r\nselections and music proved the program well arranged. Same carried out\r\nvery successfully held the interest of a not large but fair attendance\r\nthroughout. A paper and address by Wesley Greene, of Des Moines, should\r\nhave reached the ears of every Iowa and Minnesota citizen. A striking\r\nselection on \"The Tree,\" by J. A. Nelson, was descriptive, instructive,\r\nhumorous and poetic.\r\n\r\nA topic of great interest was the everbearing strawberry, which\r\npersistently bobbed up every now and then in interesting discussion.\r\nBrother Gardner, with his practical experience, was right at hand, a\r\nleader and authority on this fruit. Clarence Wedge, who always contended\r\nthat the Progressive was away ahead of all others, was endorsed by every\r\nman that grew them in this convention, by a vote on merit of varieties.\r\n\r\nReports from the different districts showed a heavy rainfall throughout\r\nthe season, resulting in rust and scab. Sprayed orchards showed better\r\nresults than others. Small fruits were abundant and good.\r\n\r\nShortly after four o'clock Wednesday afternoon automobiles drew up and\r\ntook delegates and members over beautiful Decorah, stopping at Symond's\r\ngreenhouses, and on through the most beautiful park in this section,\r\nthen to the palatial residence of John Harter, where a very bountiful\r\nbanquet was enjoyed.\r\n\r\nDuring convention Secretary Black's and Treasurer True's reports showed\r\nthe society in flourishing condition.\r\n\r\nAll officers were re-elected, place of next meeting to be chosen later\r\nby the executive committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHANDLING RASPBERRIES.--In 1911 the Government investigators\r\nmade comparative tests of the keeping qualities of carefully handled\r\nraspberries and commercially handled raspberries. Several lots of each\r\nkind were held in an ice car for varying periods and then examined for\r\nthe percentage of decay. Other lots were held a day after being\r\nwithdrawn from the refrigerator car and then examined. The results are\r\nmost significant.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 days in the ice car it was found that the carefully handled\r\nberries showed only 0.4 per cent. decay, while the commercially handled\r\nfruit had 4.6 per cent. After 8 days in the car the difference was\r\nvastly greater. The carefully handled fruit showed only 2.2 per cent.\r\ndecay, but with the commercially handled this percentage had risen to\r\n26.7, or more than one-quarter of the entire shipment. When the fruit\r\nwas examined a day after it had been taken out of the ice car, the\r\nevidence was equally strong in favor of careful handling. Carefully\r\nhandled fruit that had remained 4 days in the car was found a day after\r\nits withdrawal to show only 1 per cent. of decay against 17.5 per cent.\r\nin commercially handled berries. Carefully handled fruit left in the car\r\n8 days, and then held one day, showed only 8.1 per cent. of decay as\r\nagainst 47.6 per cent. in commercially handled fruit.\r\n\r\nThe following year experiments were made with actual shipments instead\r\nof with the stationary refrigerator car, and the results confirmed\r\nprevious conclusions. It was found, for example, that there was less\r\ndecay in the carefully handled berries at the end of 8 days than in the\r\ncommercially handled berries at the end of 4. Carefully handled fruit\r\nthat was 4 days in transit, and had then been held one day after\r\nwithdrawal from the refrigerator car showed less than 1 per cent of\r\ndecay, whereas commercially handled berries subjected to the same test\r\nshowed nearly 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrcharding in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nRICHARD WELLINGTON, ASST. HORTICULTURIST, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper is purposely given a broad title so that it may cover any\r\nquestions which come under the head of orcharding. Many of you who have\r\nbeen pestered with an \"Orchard Survey Blank\" can easily guess what\r\nsubjects are to be taken up. Thanks to many of the members of this\r\nsociety and other fruit growers for their hearty co-operation, a large\r\namount of data has been collected from fifty-three counties,\r\nrepresenting most of the districts within the state. As would be\r\nexpected certain counties have contributed much more information than\r\nothers, probably owing to their greater interest in orcharding. For\r\nexample: Thirty-one replies have already been received from Hennepin\r\nCounty, seven from Goodhue, six from Renville, five each from Houston,\r\nMeeker and Rice, four each from Chippewa, Dakota, Mower, Polk and\r\nWabasha, three each from Blue Earth, Nicollet, Ottertail, Pine, Ramsey,\r\nSteele, Washington and Watonwan and one or two each from the remaining\r\ncounties. Perhaps if the right parties had been reached the low-standing\r\ncounties would have a higher ranking.\r\n\r\nThe best way to present the data is an enigma. If all the information\r\nwas given at one time we would need a whole day instead of fifteen\r\nminutes. Of course much of the material is a repetition, and a general\r\nsummary will cover the main facts in most cases. Nevertheless it is not\r\nfeasible to take up all of the subject matter in this short period, and\r\ntherefore the first two topics on the survey blank have been selected,\r\nnamely, orchard sites and protective agencies. At a later date, if you\r\nare sufficiently interested in dry facts other subjects, as soils,\r\ndynamiting, orchard management, stock of fruit trees, methods of\r\nplanting and pruning, varieties for various localities, etc., will be\r\ntaken up. Some of the subjects, like sites and soils, will be treated as\r\nstate problems, while others must be considered as sectional.\r\n\r\nMinnesota, as you all know, contains many different climatic conditions,\r\nand consequently its orchard practices and recommendations must vary\r\naccordingly. To meet this problem the writer, in consultation with Prof.\r\nCady, divided the state into six sections, namely, the southeastern,\r\neast central, northeastern, northwestern, west central and southwestern.\r\nMany counties are, of course, in an intermediate position and might be\r\nthrown into either of the adjoining sections, but an arbitrary line\r\nmust be drawn somewhere. Freeborn, Waseca, Rice, Goodhue and all the\r\ncounties east of them are placed in the southeastern section. Nicollet,\r\nLeSueur, Sibley, McLeod, Wright, Isanti and the counties to the east are\r\nincluded in the central east, and Pine, Mille Lacs, Morrison and the\r\ncounties to the north and east are placed in the northeastern section.\r\nBeltrami, Hubbard, Ottertail and the counties to the west are placed in\r\nnorthwestern section; Traverse, Douglas, Todd, Stearns, Meeker,\r\nRenville, Yellow Medicine and the enclosed counties in the west central,\r\nand the remainder to the south and west are in the southwestern section.\r\nThus, when the various sections are mentioned, you will know what part\r\nof the state is being referred to.\r\n\r\n_Site of Orchard._ By site of orchard we refer to its location, that is,\r\nwhether it is on rolling, level or hilly ground, and the direction of\r\nits slope, provided it has one. From past experience it is believed that\r\nan orchard situated on a north slope is ideally located for Minnesota\r\nconditions, as its blossoming period is retarded and consequently the\r\nliability of injury from late frosts decreased. But all people who want\r\norchards do not possess such a slope, so they set out their orchards on\r\nthe most convenient location. A few growers have orchards sloping in all\r\ndirections, and their opinion on the influence of slope on hardiness and\r\nretardation of the blooming period should be valuable. It is of interest\r\nto note that, out of 108 reporting on the levelness of the orchard\r\nground, only twelve had level ground, two level to nearly level, one\r\nlevel to decidedly rolling, twenty-nine nearly level, seven nearly level\r\nto slightly rolling, three nearly level to medium rolling, twenty-nine\r\nslightly rolling, four slightly rolling to medium rolling, eighteen\r\nrolling and three decidedly rolling. A glance at the figures shows that\r\nthe majority of orchards are on nearly level to slightly rolling land.\r\nIn addition to the numbers given thirteen reported a slight slope, one a\r\nslight slope to a medium slope, two a slight to a steep slope, sixteen a\r\nmedium slope, one a medium to a steep slope, and five a steep slope--the\r\nemphasis being laid on the moderate rising ground. No grower reported an\r\norchard location entirely at the base of a slope, but six reported\r\norchards extending from the base to the top of the slope, two from the\r\nbase to midway of the slope, twenty-five at midway of the slope, seven\r\nfrom midway to the top and twenty-two at the top of a slope--the high\r\nground evidently being preferred for orchard sites. As a general rule,\r\nas would naturally be expected, those who reported their orchards on the\r\ntop of the slope usually reported their ground as either high or medium.\r\nOf ninety-six reports on the elevation of the orchards only four\r\nreported low land, and two of these were on top of a slope, two low and\r\nmedium, one low and high, forty-six medium, fourteen medium and high,\r\nand twenty-seven high--the medium taking the lead. These figures have\r\nbeen given of the state as a whole, but when the sections are considered\r\nthe southeastern and the west central take the lead in the highest\r\npercentage of high ground in comparison with the lower ground; the\r\nsoutheastern and east central, for the greatest amount of rolling land;\r\nand the southwestern, for the most level or nearly level land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Down the long row. View in well cared for orchard of J. M.\r\nBarclay, Madison Lake.]\r\n\r\nAs for the effect of direction of slope on hardiness, there were many\r\nvaried opinions. Thirty stated without question that the direction had\r\nan effect, thirty-one stated that it had no effect, and seventy-two\r\nadmitted that they did not know. Of those answering in the affirmative\r\nonly seven had two or more distinctly different slopes, while fifteen of\r\nthe negatives had two or more slopes for comparison. Nine of those who\r\nstated they didn't know had two or more slopes upon which to base their\r\njudgment. In summing up the direction of sites preferred, seventy-seven\r\nrecommended a northerly slope, nine had no preference, one preferred\r\nsoutheast, one west, one west and east, two east, one north and east,\r\none northeast or east, and sixty-four expressed no opinion. Two growers\r\nstated that the north slope prevented early bloom and thereby lessened\r\nliability to injury from late frosts, two growers stated that northern\r\nslopes decreased the loss of moisture, and one stated that the northeast\r\nslope gives the largest fruit and the west the best colored.\r\n\r\nAs a brief summary of the reports on orchard sites, it may be stated\r\nthat high ground, rolling or sloping to the north, is preferred by the\r\nmajority of growers who filled out these orchard survey blanks.\r\n\r\n_Protective Agencies._ Under this heading comes windbreaks of all kinds,\r\nwhether hills, natural timber or planted trees, and bodies of water\r\nwhich ameliorate the climate. Out of fifty-four replies from the central\r\neast section, sixteen reported that their orchards were favorably\r\naffected by lakes, the benefit coming in most cases from the prevention\r\nof early and late frosts. One grower attributed the cooling of the air\r\nduring the summer as a benefit and two stated that the bodies of water\r\nfurnished moisture. Two growers in the southeast section received\r\nfavorable influences from the Mississippi River, and one in the\r\nsouthwestern and two in the west central sections thought they received\r\nbeneficial effects from lakes. According to this data, orchards in the\r\neast central section, owing largely to the influence of Lake Minnetonka,\r\nare greatly benefited by the presence of water.\r\n\r\nWindbreaks are a very important factor in successful orcharding in\r\nMinnesota, even though one party in the southeast section and three\r\nparties in the central east noted no beneficial effects. According to\r\nreports from the central west and southwest sections they are of great\r\nbenefit and in some cases indispensable to apple growing. As would be\r\nexpected by any one who is acquainted with Minnesota, the planted\r\nwindbreaks are a more important factor in the prairie country than in\r\nthe natural wooded and hilly regions. In the southeast section, five\r\norchards were reported as protected by bluffs and hills, three by both\r\nhills and natural woods, two by natural woods, two by both natural and\r\nplanted woods, and twenty-one by planted woods; in the central east\r\nsection, one by a hill and a planted windbreak, one by a town, fifteen\r\nby natural timber, two by natural and planted timber, and nineteen by\r\nplanted windbreaks; in the northeast section, two by natural and four by\r\nplanted windbreaks; in the northwest section, three by natural and two\r\nby planted windbreaks; in the west central section, one by a hill and\r\nnatural timber, five by natural timber, two by natural timber and\r\nplanted windbreaks, and eighteen by planted windbreaks; and in the\r\nsouthwest section, one by a hill and natural woods, one by a hill and\r\nplanted windbreak, two by natural timber, and fifteen by planted\r\nwindbreaks. If Meeker County, which has natural timber, was not included\r\nin the central west--and perhaps it should have been included in central\r\neast--this section would have only one orchard protected alone by\r\nnatural timber; and if Blue Earth County was eliminated from the\r\nsouthwest, this section would have no orchard protected alone by natural\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects from windbreaks may be summed up as follows:\r\nTwenty-five reported that they prevented fruit from being blown off\r\ntrees, nine that they prevented trees and limbs being broken by winds\r\nand storms, ten that they protected trees from injury by winds without\r\nspecifying the kind of injury, four that they reduced injury from\r\nfrosts, ten that they either prevented or reduced winter injury, four\r\nthat they helped to retain moisture, five that they helped to hold snow,\r\neight that they prevented snow drifting, five that they protected\r\norchards from hot and dry winds, three that they permitted the growing\r\nof apples, and one that they supplied all advantages.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of trees recommended for windbreaks and the methods of\r\nplanting are numerous and variable and to discuss them at length would\r\ntake too much time. However, the principal facts may be briefly\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\nIn eighty-five reports that listed set out windbreaks, it was found that\r\nfifty-seven growers had used evergreens, thirty-seven willows,\r\ntwenty-nine box elders, twenty-five maples, seventeen cottonwoods,\r\nthirteen ashes, eleven elms, eight poplars, four oaks, four plums, three\r\nnuts and one apple. The evergreens consisted of thirteen Scotch pine,\r\neleven evergreens (not named), eight Norway spruce, five spruce (not\r\nnamed), three balsam, three Austrian pine, two white pine, one yellow\r\npine, two cedar, two white spruce, two pine (variety not named), two\r\nfir, two jack pine, one Black Hills spruce, and one tamarack. In the\r\nwillows were given twenty willows (variety not named), two\r\nlaurel-leaved, seven white and eight golden; in the maples, sixteen soft\r\nmaples, two hard maples, one silver-maple and six maples (kind not\r\nnamed); in the poplars, five Norway, one Carolina, two poplar (kind not\r\nnamed); and in the nuts, one black walnut, one butternut and one walnut.\r\nThe major part of the box elders, cottonwoods, willows and ashes were\r\nnoted in the central west and southwest sections. Thirty-seven\r\nexperienced growers of windbreaks, the most of them living in the\r\nsouthwest, west central and southeast sections, recommended the\r\nfollowing trees for windbreaks in the given proportions, twenty-four\r\nevergreens, fifteen willows, seven maples, six poplars, five elms, five\r\nbox elders, three elms, two plum, two cottonwood, three hedges, one oak,\r\none hackberry and one black walnut. The evergreens are decidedly the\r\nmost popular, and among the varieties mentioned Norway spruce takes the\r\nlead for those recommended, and the Scotch pine for those planted.\r\n\r\nThere are about as many different systems of planting used as growers.\r\nThe main point in all cases was to have a planting that would stop the\r\nwind and storms. A few growers advocated the use of a hedge or plum\r\ntrees to fill in under the windbreak, while one grower desires a\r\ncirculation of air under the branches of his trees. Cultivation and\r\nintercropping of windbreaks are also recommended in a few cases. The\r\ndistance of planting varies, of course, with the trees or shrubs used.\r\nFor example: one grower recommends 8 ft. x 8 ft. for large deciduous\r\ntrees, and another grower, 6 ft. x 12 ft. apart in rows and two rows, 12\r\nft. apart. For Scotch pine one grower advocates eight feet. In some\r\ncases a mixture of many kinds of trees is recommended, and then again\r\nonly one kind. One very solid windbreak is made up of a lilac hedge,\r\nfour rows of jack pine, four rows of Norway poplar and one row of\r\nwillow. Another is one row willow, one of evergreen, one of willow and\r\none of evergreen.\r\n\r\nVarious distances between windbreak and orchard were used and\r\nrecommended. A large number of orchards were started at about twenty\r\nfeet from the windbreak and a few as close as one rod, but these\r\ndistances proved to be too close. One grower, however, recommended close\r\nplanting and later the removal of a row of trees in the windbreak when\r\nmore space was needed. The recommended distances for planting varied\r\nfrom thirty to 500 feet, although seventy-five to 100 was satisfactory\r\nin most cases.\r\n\r\nMore details have been given in regard to orchard sites and windbreaks\r\nthan many of you are probably interested in, but for one who is planning\r\nto set out an orchard they should prove of value and profit, as they are\r\nbased upon the experiences of many of Minnesota's best orchardists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Experience with a Young Orchard.\r\n\r\nROY VIALL, SPRING VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago we acquired some land three and one-half miles north\r\nof Spring Valley. This land is very rough and was originally covered\r\nwith heavy timber, in fact, about one-third of our large orchard was\r\ncleared and grubbed out the fall before planting.\r\n\r\nWhen I became interested in fruit growing one of the first things I did\r\nwas to join the Horticultural Society and to the knowledge obtained\r\nthrough this membership we owe in large measure what success has come to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen acres selected for our main orchard slopes quite abruptly\r\nto the north and northeast. In fact, the slope is so steep that the\r\nground, if kept under cultivation, would wash badly, and this was the\r\nreal reason for seeding down our orchard at the time of planting. The\r\norchard is now seven years old, and the trees have never had a particle\r\nof cultivation. Part of this ground was in grain and seeded to alsike\r\nand timothy the year before; the balance was the new land referred to,\r\nwhich we had broken and immediately seeded down to alsike and timothy,\r\nwith oats as a nurse crop.\r\n\r\nOur first problem was what varieties to plant, in what proportion and\r\nwhere to buy them. In this we adopted the recommendation of this society\r\nat that time, choosing Wealthy, Duchess, Patten Greening and\r\nNorthwestern Greening, with fifty Malinda and fifty Iowa Beauty. We now\r\nhave in addition two small orchards with nearly forty varieties\r\naltogether. The varieties, for the large orchard were divided as\r\nfollows: 250 Duchess, 250 Patten Greening, 300 Northwestern Greening,\r\n1,000 Wealthy. Were I to set another commercial orchard of the same size\r\nit would contain 500 Duchess and the balance Wealthy. While the Patten\r\nGreening is an ideal tree and an early and prolific bearer, there is\r\nwith us a much larger per cent of imperfect and diseased fruit than of\r\nany other variety. Tree for tree, I believe the Duchess will produce\r\n_more_ saleable _fruit_.\r\n\r\nWhere to buy our trees was decided for us in one of our first numbers of\r\nthe Horticulturist, viz., at the nearest reliable nursery. That this was\r\ngood advice is evidenced by the fact that out of the 1,900 trees we have\r\nfound but two that were not as ordered.\r\n\r\nOur next problem was, at what distance to plant the trees. The more\r\ninformation we sought the less sure were we of the best plan. We were\r\nadvised to plant all distances from 12 feet by 16 feet to 24 feet by 32\r\nfeet. We finally concluded to take about an average of them all and\r\ndecided on 20 feet by 20 feet, and so far have had no reason to regret\r\nit. We have put up the alsike and timothy every year for hay with the\r\nusual machinery, and there has not been over a half dozen trees\r\nseriously damaged. Our trees were nearly all three years old, 5 to 6\r\nfeet, and we find they do much better in sod than a smaller tree.\r\n\r\nHaving the orchard set out the next thing was to protect the trees from\r\nmice and rabbits. This we did by making protectors out of wire cloth,\r\nusing different widths, from 18 to 24 inches, cutting it in strips 10\r\ninches wide and holding it about the trees by three pieces of stove pipe\r\nwire at the top, middle and bottom. Not counting the time of making and\r\nputting them on these cost us from 1-1/2 cents to 2-1/2 cents each, and\r\nlasted from three to four years. We used a few made of galvanized wire\r\ncloth, which lasted much longer.\r\n\r\nThree years ago we commenced replacing these protectors with a wash of\r\nwhite lead and raw linseed oil mixed to the consistency of separator\r\ncream. The first year we painted only fifty trees, the next year 100,\r\nthe next 300, and this last year we painted every tree on the place. We\r\ncan see no bad effects, and it certainly protects against mice and\r\nrabbits and, what is equally as important, against borers also, and the\r\ncost per tree, including labor, is much less.\r\n\r\nWe have also used the lead and oil with splendid results in treating\r\ntrees affected with canker. We had quite a number of Wealthy so\r\naffected, and we cut out the affected bark and wood and then covered the\r\nwound with lead, and in almost every case it has proved a cure, that is,\r\nstopped the spread of the canker.\r\n\r\nThe second year our orchard was set out we began to mulch the trees with\r\ngrass cut in the orchard, clover straw, pea straw--anything we could\r\nget. We were unable to mulch the entire orchard that year, and before we\r\ngot the balance mulched you could tell as far as you could see the\r\norchard which trees were mulched and which were not. The former not only\r\nmade a better growth, but had a healthier look. Now I do not want you to\r\nget the idea that I am advocating the sod system except in locations\r\nsimilar to ours. Were our orchard on more level ground I not only should\r\nhave cultivated the first three years, as advocated by most authorities,\r\nbut would have continued the cultivation in some degree at least.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on account probably of the very favorable location, I\r\nthink our orchard will compare favorably with any cultivated orchard of\r\nthe same age. Having the orchard set out, protected against mice and\r\nrabbits and mulched, we found that the real work of raising an orchard\r\nhad just begun. First came the gray beetles the following June, and they\r\nate the new growth off several hundred trees before we discovered them.\r\nAt that time, not knowing what else to do, we hand picked every one we\r\ncould find and destroyed them. These beetles we found came from oak\r\ngroves on the south and west, and the next year we sprayed with arsenate\r\nof lead six or eight rows of trees on that side of the orchard, and as\r\nwe have since then sprayed the entire orchard each year we have had no\r\nfurther trouble.\r\n\r\nNext came pocket gophers, and before we learned how to stop them we had\r\nlost a number of trees by their chewing off the roots just beneath the\r\nsurface of the ground. By opening their runways and placing well down in\r\nthem a piece of carrot or potato in which has been placed a little\r\nstrychnine we succeeded in getting rid of them entirely. Next came the\r\nwoodchucks. They were very destructive with us, chewing the bark above\r\nthe protectors as well as the roots. Trapping is the most successful\r\nmethod we have found, and by keeping a half dozen traps out all the time\r\nwe held them in check. Eternal vigilance must be the motto of the\r\nsuccessful orchardist.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1913 we picked our first crop of apples, that is, in\r\nsufficient quantity to be considered in a commercial way. Our Duchess we\r\nsold in barrels at $2.00 net. Wealthy we packed in bushel boxes, making\r\ntwo sizes, the larger, three inches and over, we called No. 1, and they\r\nsold for $1.25 per box net. The balance or smaller ones were also sold\r\nin boxes and brought us $1.00 per box net. Patten Greenings brought us\r\n80 cents and Northwestern Greenings, 90 cents per box. Our neighbors,\r\nwho sold to the local and transient buyers in bulk and in barrels,\r\nreceived 75 cents to 90 cents per hundred pounds, or $2.00 per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe past year we had only about 75 bushels of all kinds. With the\r\nexception of Duchess and possibly Patten's Greening we shall certainly\r\nsell our next crop in bushel boxes.\r\n\r\nWe are top-working about 50 Patten's Greening to Jonathan, Delicious,\r\nMcIntosh Red and King David. As the work was only started a year ago\r\nlast spring I cannot tell you of its success or failure. So far the best\r\nresults seem to be with the Jonathan.\r\n\r\nWe also have about thirty varieties of plums, including many of Prof.\r\nHansen's new hybrids. Of these the Opata seems to be the most hardy and\r\nprolific, but it is subject to brown rot, which, this past year was so\r\nbad that we lost more than half the fruit. We have it top-worked on\r\nseveral varieties of native plums, and it was similarly affected there\r\nalso. This was the only variety in our orchard of 150 trees that was so\r\naffected. We have fifteen Surprise plums, set seven years, that have not\r\nyielded altogether a peck of plums. Only lack of time kept me from\r\ngrubbing them out last spring. This past season they were so heavily\r\nloaded that we had to prop the limbs and then thin out the fruit.\r\n\r\nWe endeavor to spray all our trees twice with commercial lime-sulphur\r\nand arsenate of lead--the first time immediately after the blossoms\r\nfall, the second two weeks later. Our spraying outfit consists of a\r\nMorrill & Morley hand pump, fitted in a 100-gallon tank, which we\r\nmounted on a small, one-horse truck. We operate it with three men, one\r\nto drive and pump and one for each line of hose, spraying two rows of\r\ntrees at once. With this outfit we can spray 400 to 500 trees (of the\r\nsize of ours) a day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL FORESTS--besides being the American farmer's most\r\nvaluable source of wood, which is the chief building material for rural\r\npurposes, are also his most valuable source of water, both for\r\nirrigation and domestic use. In the West, they afford him a protected\r\ngrazing range for his stock; they are the best insurance against flood\r\ndamage to his fields, his buildings, his bridges, his roads, and the\r\nfertility of his soil. The national forests cover the higher portions of\r\nthe Rocky Mountain ranges, the Cascades, the Pacific Coast ranges, and a\r\nlarge part of the forested coast and islands of Alaska; some of the\r\nhilly regions in Montana and in the Dakotas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and\r\nlimited areas in Minnesota, Michigan, Florida, and Porto Rico. In\r\naddition, land is now being purchased for national forests in the White\r\nMountains of New England and in the southern Appalachians. In regions so\r\nwidely scattered, agricultural and forest conditions necessarily differ\r\nto a great degree, bringing about corresponding differences in the\r\neffect of the national forests on the agricultural interests of the\r\nvarious localities. Wherever agriculture can be practiced, however, the\r\nfarmer is directly benefited by the existence of national forests and by\r\ntheir proper management.--U.S. Dept. of Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\nSOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF COAL ASHES--\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the time of the year when the unsightly heaps of coal ashes are\r\nlikely to appear in one's back yard--eyesores and apparently useless.\r\n\r\nYet there are several ways in which they can be used to advantage about\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nThey should first be sifted, using a quarter-inch wire mesh. The rough\r\nor coarser parts are well adapted for use on paths and driveways,\r\nforming a clean, firm surface with use. These paths are especially good\r\nin the garden, for weeds do not grow readily in them, and they dry off\r\nquickly after a rain.\r\n\r\nSuch parts of the ashes as will pass through an inch mesh will make a\r\nvery good summer mulch about fruit trees and bushes that require such\r\ncare. This mulch will conserve the moisture at the roots of the tree or\r\nplant at a time when it is very necessary to have it.\r\n\r\nAbout a pyramid of these coarse ashes one may plant anything that\r\nrequires much water. The roots of the plants will run under the ashes\r\nand keep moist and cool. Through a drought a little water poured upon\r\nthe ashes will be distributed to the roots without loss.\r\n\r\nThe fine sifted ashes will render the tougher hard soils more friable,\r\ntheir chief virtue being lightening it. In a very mild degree they are a\r\nfertilizer, though in no degree comparable in this respect to hardwood\r\nashes. Yet it has been proved that soil to which sifted coal ashes had\r\nbeen added grew plants of richer, darker foliage. They must be very well\r\nmixed with the soil by a thorough spading and forking.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment was noted in the Garden Magazine: A soil was\r\nprepared as follows: One-eighth stable manure, one-eighth leaf mold,\r\none-quarter garden soil (heavy), one-half sifted coal ashes. Plants\r\ngrown in this soil surpassed those grown in the garden soil next to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCoal ashes would not be advised for a light soil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWatch this page for announcement of Garden Flower Society meetings.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20th, Public Library, Minneapolis, Tenth and Hennepin,\r\nDirectors' Room, 2:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS:\r\n\r\nHotbeds, coldframes, management and care of the young plants, Mr. Frank\r\nH.

No one who\r\ncontemplates having a garden this year can afford to miss it. Let us be\r\ngenerous and share our good programs with as many as possible. Each\r\nmember is host or hostess for that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING WISCONSIN STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCY.--This\r\nmeeting is to be held at Madison, Wis., on January 5-7. Mr. Chas.\r\nHaralson, superintendent of our State Fruit-Breeding Farm, is to\r\nrepresent this society at that meeting. We may look for an interesting\r\nreport from him in the February issue of our monthly.\r\n\r\nIS YOUR ANNUAL FEE PAID?--If not, won't you please send it in\r\npromptly, remitting by a $1.00 bill, which is a safe medium of payment,\r\ninstead of using check unless you draw on a bank in one of the larger\r\ncities of the state. Checks on country banks, as a rule, can only be\r\ncollected here by a payment of ten cents, which the society can ill\r\nafford to pay for so many members.\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING S.D. HORT. SOCY.--The annual gathering of this\r\nsister association will be held in Huron, S.D., January 18-20. Quite a\r\ngood many of our members live so near the state line that they may find\r\nit convenient to attend this meeting, which will certainly be a\r\nprofitable one. Prof. N. E. Hansen is secretary. Mr. Wm. Pfaender, Jr.,\r\nof New Ulm, is to be the representative of this society at the South\r\nDakota meeting.\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING SOUTHERN MINNESOTA HORT. SOCY.--This very\r\nwide-awake auxiliary of the state society will hold its annual meeting\r\nin Austin, January 19th and 20th next. The program of the meeting is not\r\nyet at hand, but you may be sure that it will be an interesting and\r\npractical one. If the reader is living anywhere within convenient range\r\nof Austin by all means attend this meeting and get inspiration and help\r\nfor the work of another season.\r\n\r\nYOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN.--This refers to members of the society\r\nwho have paid their annual fee for 1916 and are wondering why they have\r\nnot yet received the membership ticket. There is always a little\r\nunavoidable delay in sending out these tickets after the annual meeting.\r\nFirst the tickets must be printed, and then the society folder that goes\r\nout with them must be prepared, and the material making up this folder\r\ncomes from quite a number of sources, and it takes more or less time to\r\nget all of these matters together and in shape. You need not be\r\nsolicitous in regard to membership fees remitted, as the chance of loss\r\nin transmission is approximately nothing; hardly half a dozen instances\r\nof the kind have come up in the twenty-five years of service of the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nPASSING OF MICHAEL BENDEL, SR.--This old member of our society\r\nand resident of Madison has just been called away, December 23rd, at the\r\nage of seventy-nine years. While not an attendant at our meetings he was\r\na most loyal member of the society, and especially conspicuous in the\r\nwestern part of the state, where he lived, as a successful experimenter\r\nin orcharding, in which work he had a large experience. His portrait and\r\na brief sketch of his life appear in the 1914 volume of our report, on\r\npage 150. Mr. Bendel was for many years president of the Lac qui Parle\r\nCounty Agricultural Society, was always greatly interested in everything\r\nto improve the interests of his community, and especially those\r\npertaining to farm life. He has left an enviable record.\r\n\r\nFARMERS AND HOME MAKERS WEEK.--University Farm, midway between\r\nMinneapolis and St. Paul, have prepared a royal program for all\r\ninterested in agricultural work and life, including the needs of the\r\nhousehold, filling all of next week, from January 3rd to 8th, inclusive.\r\nSeventy-nine professors and instructors by count are on the program for\r\nthe week, and it is so arranged that those attending pass from one\r\nlecture room to another, from hour to hour, selecting the subjects that\r\nthey have a special interest in. Horticulture, or subjects closely akin,\r\nhave a place on this program Monday afternoon, Tuesday forenoon and\r\nafternoon, Wednesday forenoon and Thursday forenoon; Thursday afternoon\r\nthe horticultural program is devoted entirely to vegetables; Friday\r\nforenoon and afternoon; and Saturday forenoon altogether spraying. When\r\nthis magazine is received it will be too late to send for a program, but\r\nnot too late to attend the meetings, which we hope many of our members\r\nmay have the opportunity to do.\r\n\r\nATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETING.--The badge book, which is issued\r\nat every annual meeting, containing the list of those who notify the\r\nsecretary of a purpose to attend the meeting, is a pretty good index of\r\nthe attendance. This year the badge book contained 442 names. Of course\r\nnot all of these were present at the meeting, but a great many who were\r\nthere had not sent notice of attendance and whose names were not in the\r\nbadge book, so that the figures given elsewhere in this magazine as to\r\nattendance, estimated at from 400 to 500, are certainly not any too\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nOf this number not to exceed fifteen members, including vice presidents\r\nand superintendents of trial stations living at a distance, receive\r\ntheir railroad fare to and from the annual meeting, which is the only\r\ncompensation they receive for their work in operating the trial stations\r\nand preparing the annual or semi-annual reports connected with their\r\npositions. This is not in fact any compensation for service but rather a\r\nrecognition of the large obligation under which the society rests\r\ntowards them for such gratuitous service.\r\n\r\nPLANT PREMIUMS FOR 1916.--On the inside front cover page of\r\nthis monthly will be found a list of the plant premiums offered to our\r\nmembership the coming spring. This list is also published in the society\r\nfolder, of which copies will be sent to each member and which can be\r\nsupplied in any number desired by application to the secretary. The list\r\nof plant premiums includes a considerable variety of plants both\r\nornamental and otherwise useful. Those of special interest this year are\r\nthe new fruits being sent out from the State Fruit-Breeding Farm,\r\nincluding No. 3 June-bearing strawberry, which gives promise of being a\r\nvery valuable fruit for Minnesota planters; No. 1017 everbearing\r\nstrawberry, the kind which has been selected from thousands of varieties\r\nfruiting at the station, a good plant maker and also a prolific fruiter\r\nof high quality berries; No. 4 raspberry, a variety of extraordinary\r\nvigor and hardiness, large fruited, and a prolific bearer; and several\r\nvarieties of large fruited plums. Every member of the society with\r\nfacilities for growing fruits should be interested in trying these new\r\nvarieties, which of course are still being sent out on trial, and we\r\ndesire to hear from our membership as to their measure of success with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.

C. Gregg, Hon. W. G. LeDuc, Mr. Chas. G. Patten and\r\nMr. A. W. Latham.\r\n\r\nThese certificates were awarded Saturday, January 8th, 1916, at the\r\nclosing exercises of the Farmers Week at the University Farm before an\r\naudience of twelve hundred people, gathered in the chapel in the\r\nAdministration Building. Appropriate exercises were conducted by the\r\nPresident, Geo. E. Vincent, and the Dean of the University Farm, A.F.\r\nWoods, in the presence of Hon. Fred B. Snyder, President of the Board of\r\nRegents of the State University, and other members of the Board and a\r\nlarge representation of the professorship of University Farm School,\r\nalso occupying the platform.\r\n\r\nDean Woods read a sketch of the life of each one of the recipients, and\r\nthe certificates were formally presented to each in turn by the\r\nPresident of the State University. All the persons who were to receive\r\nthis honor were in attendance except Gen. LeDuc, who was probably unable\r\nto be present on account of his extreme age.\r\n\r\nWhen this matter was first called to my attention I felt that it would\r\nbe entirely out of place, being its editor, that I should make reference\r\nto it in the society monthly, but as the fact has been widely published\r\nthroughout the state, and whatever honor is connected with this\r\npresentation is to be shared with the members of the Horticultural\r\nSociety, I have changed my view point in regard to this, and it seems to\r\nme now that the members of the society should be fully informed as to\r\nwhat has taken place.\r\n\r\nMr. O. C. Gregg received this distinction on account of his connection\r\nwith the farmers' institutes of the state, of which he was the pioneer,\r\nand in connection with which he remained as superintendent for some\r\ntwenty-two years.\r\n\r\nGen. LeDuc was for a number of years Commissioner of Agriculture at\r\nWashington and introduced many important reforms in the management of\r\nthat department.\r\n\r\nMr. Chas. G. Patten is well known to our members of course as the\r\noriginator of the Patten's Greening apple, although this is quite an\r\ninfinitesimal part of the work that he has done in connection with the\r\nbreeding of fruits, the results from which the public are to profit by\r\nlargely, we believe, in the early future. At his advanced age of\r\neighty-four we feel that this honor has been wisely placed.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. A. W. Latham has been secretary of the Minnesota State Horticultural\r\nSociety for twenty-five years, during which period its membership has\r\nadvanced from one or two hundred to thirty-four hundred, making it the\r\nlargest horticultural society in the country, and probably,\" as stated\r\nby the Dean in his address, \"the largest in the world.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this distinction has been conferred upon the secretary of your\r\nsociety it is not to be considered as so much a personal tribute to him\r\nas a recognition of the splendid work done by the society as a whole, in\r\nwhich every member has had some share. To express fully my thought in\r\nthis I will refer briefly to the organization of the society, just half\r\na century ago, when a handful of earnest men united their efforts under\r\nthe name of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society in an endeavor to\r\nsolve the difficult problems connected with fruit growing in this\r\nregion. None of the men who at that time organized this society are now\r\nliving, but others have taken their places, and the important service\r\nthat was so well cared for by the earlier membership is being equally as\r\nwell prosecuted by those who have succeeded them.\r\n\r\nMy personal connection with the society began the third year of its\r\nexistence, so that I had the high privilege of enjoying personal\r\nacquaintance with practically all those earlier workers in the society,\r\nand indeed most of them were still alive when I came into the\r\nsecretaryship twenty-five years ago. It will not be out of place to\r\nspeak here particularly of a few of those who are no longer with us:\r\nJohn S. Harris, that staunch friend, one of the original twelve, whose\r\nmedallion hangs on the wall of the horticultural classroom at University\r\nFarm; Peter M. Gideon, whose self-sacrifice gave us the Wealthy apple,\r\nnow of worldwide planting--he in whose memory the Gideon Memorial Fund\r\nwas created; Col. John H. Stevens, that large hearted man of\r\nunquenchable public spirit; P.A. Jewell, searcher for new fruits and\r\nfounder of the Jewell Nursery Company; Truman M. Smith, seven years\r\npresident during many dark days; Wyman Elliot, one of the original\r\ntwelve, well called by one \"King of the Horticultural Society\"--so\r\nrecently taken from us. The institution of learning conferring this\r\ndistinction upon us has contributed a full share of workers now no\r\nlonger with us; W. W. Pendergast, first principal of the University Farm\r\nSchool, and for many years president of the society until stricken with\r\na fatal illness; and Prof. Saml. B. Green of blessed memory, whose loss\r\nwe shall never cease to mourn. There are many others who did great\r\nservice to the society that I should be glad to speak of here if space\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nIn the list of those who are still with us and have served with such\r\nself devotion and courage in advancing the interests of the society, and\r\nthat for which it stands, are to be found the names of many men\r\nprominent in various walks of life in our state. It would be out of\r\nplace for me to select from this list a few and give them special\r\nprominence where hundreds have contributed to the life and growth of the\r\nassociation all these many years until the present enviable place now\r\noccupied by the association has been attained. To the executive board of\r\nthe society, most of whom have been members of the board for a long\r\nperiod of years, of course the success of the association is especially\r\ndue. Men of initiative in an ambitious and unselfish way working for\r\nthe success of the association, they have had very much indeed to do\r\nwith its progress.\r\n\r\nAs I endeavor to recall the personality of those who have been of\r\nspecial service to us I find the list almost without limit. With what\r\npleasure and satisfaction have I been permitted to serve with the\r\nmembers of this society! What willingness to perform the duties\r\nsuggested has ever characterized the assistance that has been rendered\r\nby the membership of this society! It has been an exceedingly rare thing\r\nfor any member to offer an objection to undertaking any service asked of\r\nhim, and with such support as this so readily and heartily given, and\r\noften at large expense to the member, what can be expected other than\r\nsuch success as has come to our society. I wish I had the ability to\r\nexpress at this time the thought that is in my heart as I recall all of\r\nthese helpful brothers and sisters to whom indeed belongs as much as to\r\nthe writer any distinction that comes to the society as a result of\r\nthese years of labor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the State University have seen fit to refer to this in a\r\nway to indicate that our society has reached some certain vantage\r\nground, it must not be lost sight of that the real work of the society\r\nis still before it. Whether to be carried on under the present\r\nmanagement or under a changed management we have a right to look ahead\r\nand anticipate the definite and widely expanding results that are still\r\nto come from the services of the members of the society, which we are\r\nsure in the future, as in the past, will be heartily rendered.\r\n\r\nA. W. LATHAM, Secy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune-Bearing Strawberries.\r\n\r\nGEO. J. KELLOGG, RETIRED NURSERYMAN, JANESVILLE, WIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny fool that knows enough can grow strawberries, which reminds me of\r\nthe preacher in York State who both preached and farmed it. He was\r\ntrying to bore a beetle head and could not hold it; a foolish boy came\r\nalong and said, \"Why don't you put it in the hog trough?\" \"Well! Well!\"\r\nthe preacher said. \"You can learn something from most any fool.\" The boy\r\nsaid, \"That is just what father says when he hears you preach.\" I don't\r\nexpect to tell you much that is new, but I want to emphasize the good\r\nthings that others have said:\r\n\r\n_Soils._ I once had twenty-one acres of heavy oak, hickory, crab apple\r\nand hazel brush, with one old Indian corn field. I measured hazel brush\r\ntwelve feet high, and some of the ground was a perfect network of hazel\r\nroots; the leaf mould had accumulated for ages. The first half acre I\r\nplanted to turnips, the next spring I started in to make my fortune. I\r\nset out nineteen varieties of the best strawberries away back in the\r\ntime of the Wilson, than which we have never had its equal. The plants\r\ngrew well and wintered well, but they did not bear worth a cent, while\r\njust over the fence I had a field on ground that had been worked twenty\r\nyears without manure that gave me two hundred and sixty bushels to the\r\nacre. It took three years with other crops to reduce that loose soil\r\nbefore I could make strawberries pay. My fortune all vanished.\r\n\r\nLast June while judging your strawberry show, I found a large collection\r\nof twenty-five kinds of the poorest strawberries I ever saw, grown on\r\nthe college grounds. I visited the field, found over a hundred\r\nvarieties, well tallied, well cultivated, on new oak opening soil. First\r\ncrop, the soil seemed ideal, every thing good except the plants and the\r\nfruit. The foliage was defective and the fruit very poor. Was it the new\r\nsoil?\r\n\r\nI have always found good garden soil would produce good strawberries;\r\nthe best beds were those that followed potatoes. Cut worms and white\r\ngrubs seldom follow two years of hoed crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Geo. J. Kellogg ten years ago]\r\n\r\n_Preparation._ Preparation for the best strawberries should be started\r\nthree years before planting. Using soil from sand to clay, well drained,\r\nwell manured, sowed to clover, take off the first cutting of clover,\r\nthen more manure plowed under deep with the second crop of clover, as\r\nlate as can before freezing up, to kill insects and make the soil\r\nfriable and ready for a crop of potatoes the next spring. After\r\nharvesting 300 bushels of potatoes to the acre use a heavy coat of well\r\nrotted manure without weed seed, plowed under late in fall. The\r\nfollowing spring, as soon as the ground will work, thoroughly disk and\r\nharrow, and harrow twice more. Then roll or plank it, mark both ways two\r\nby four feet, set by hand either with dibble or spade, no machine work.\r\nCrown even with the surface, with best of plants from new beds, leaving\r\non but two leaves, and if the roots are not fresh dug, trim them a\r\nlittle. Firm them good.\r\n\r\nNow start the weeder and go over the field every week till the runners\r\nstart, then use the nine-tooth cultivator with the two outside teeth two\r\ninches shorter than the others. Cultivate every week till the middle of\r\nOctober. Use the hoe to keep out all weeds and hoe very lightly about\r\nthe plants. Weeds are a blessing to the lazy man, but I don't like to\r\nhave it overdone. Don't let the soil bake after a rain. Keep the\r\ncultivator running. In garden work a steel tooth rake is a splendid\r\ngarden tool.\r\n\r\nVolume 1905, page 230 (An. Report Minn. State Hort. Society). Mr. Schwab\r\ngets an ideal strawberry bed, then kills it with twelve inches of mulch.\r\nIf the ice and snow had not come perhaps the plants would have pulled\r\nthrough. Volume 41, page 390. Mr. Wildhagen gives an ideal paper on\r\nstrawberries, it will pay you to read it again and again. Instead of one\r\nyear's preparation, I would have three.\r\n\r\n_Winter Protection._ Unless in an exposed place, marsh hay is the best\r\nand cleanest mulch, but high winds may roll it off. Clean straw away\r\nfrom the tailings of the machine is next best. For small acreage if one\r\ninch can be put on as soon as the ground is frozen a half inch, it will\r\nsave the many freezings and thawings before winter sets in. For large\r\nacreage it is not practical to cover till frost will hold up a loaded\r\nwagon. Two inches of mulch, that covers the plants and paths from sight\r\nis enough, but I see you cover deeper, from four to twelve inches in\r\nMinnesota, and often smother the plants. If we could have a snow blanket\r\ncome early and stay on late in spring, that would protect the plants,\r\nbut we want the mulch also to protect from drouth and keep the berries\r\nclean. A January thaw is liable to kill out any field that is not\r\nproperly mulched.\r\n\r\nA two inch mulch will not hinder the plants coming through in spring;\r\nfour inches will require part of the mulch raked into the paths; if\r\nplants don't get through readily loosen the mulch. I have known some\r\nsuccessful growers to take off all the mulch from the paths in spring\r\nand cultivate lightly but thoroughly, then replace the mulch to protect\r\nfrom drouth and to keep the berries clean, but I don't think it pays.\r\n\r\n_Weeds._ In the best fields and beds I ever saw there will come up an\r\noccasional weed in spring, and it pays to go over the ground with a\r\nspade or butcher knife and take out such weeds. We almost always get a\r\ndrouth at picking time, better a drought than too much rain. A good\r\nstraw mulch will usually carry us through.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._ If irrigation is attempted the fields must be prepared\r\nbefore planting to run water through between the rows. Sprinkling will\r\nnot do except at sundown. Rain always comes in cloudy weather; you\r\ncannot wet foliage in sun in hot weather without damage. A good rainfall\r\nis one inch, which is a thousand barrels to the acre, so what can you do\r\nwith a sprinkling cart? Showers followed by bright sunshine damage the\r\npatch.\r\n\r\nIf your plants are set too deep they rot, if too high they dry, if not\r\nwell firmed they fail. When I have used a tobacco planter I have had to\r\nput my heel on every plant. Of course you know that newly planted June\r\nvarieties must have the blossom buds cut out, and everbears bearing must\r\nalso till July.\r\n\r\n_Picking._ The man who has acres to pick must secure his boxes the\r\nwinter before and have at least part of them made up if they are to be\r\ntacked. I have found a boy can make up boxes as fast as thirty pickers\r\ncan fill. If you use the folding box no tacks are needed. Too many boxes\r\nmade up ahead are liable to be damaged by the mice.\r\n\r\n_Pickers._ Engage your pickers ahead; agree on the price and that a part\r\nof the pay is to be kept back till the close of the season, which is\r\nforfeited if quitting before time. If pickers are too far away,\r\ntransportation must be furnished--free boxes of berries are appreciated\r\nby the pickers.\r\n\r\n_Marketing._ Sometimes the marketing of the fruit is harder than the\r\ngrowing of it. If enough is grown form an association to sell it, get\r\nadvice from a successful association how to form and how to run it.\r\nSometimes a well made wagon, a good team and a good man can sell from\r\nhouse to house in the country and city and make good returns. In this\r\nway you get back your crates and part of the boxes. I know a successful\r\ngrower in Iowa, who sold his crop of ten acres to the farmers and city\r\npeople, they doing their own picking and furnishing their own boxes, at\r\na given price. All the proprietor had to do was sit at the gate and take\r\nin the cash. It is worth a good deal to know how to grow the best of\r\nstrawberries and often it is worth more to know how to turn them into\r\ncash.\r\n\r\n_What Varieties?_ Dunlap and Warfield have a general reputation for\r\nprofit, can be picked together and sell well; dark color, good canners\r\nand good shippers. If you want a third variety take Lovett. Some of your\r\ngrowers want nothing but Bederwood, but it is too light and too soft to\r\nship, though it is a good family berry. I expect Minnesota No. 3 will\r\nsoon be the only variety you will want of the June kinds.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ Winter drouth often injures the roots and some lay it to\r\ninsects. The winter of 1899 was the worst winter drouth I ever knew; it\r\nkilled every thing. If you are troubled with the crown borer, root lice,\r\nleaf roller or rust, grow one crop and plow under, or move your fields a\r\ngood distance from the old bed. What shall be done with the old bed? If\r\nyou have insects or rust plow under and get the best place to start a\r\nnew bed, and don't set any of your own plants if you have insects or\r\nrust--and be sure you buy of a reliable grower.\r\n\r\n_Old Beds._ If the first crop is big, plow under, if light and you have\r\na good stand of plants, no insects or rust, you can mow and teddy up the\r\nmulch and in a high wind burn it over--a quick fire will do no harm.\r\nThen you can plow two furrows between rows and drag it every way till\r\nnot a plant is seen. Soon, if the rows are left a foot wide, the plants\r\nwill come through. Then manure (better be manured before plowing), and\r\nyou may get a good second crop. Some mow and rake off and burn outside\r\nthe bed, then with a two horse cultivator dig up the paths and cultivate\r\nand get the ground in condition. Put on the manure and hoe out part of\r\nthe old plants.\r\n\r\nI like the plan of Wildhagen; mow, burn and then cover three inches deep\r\nwith one hundred big loads of manure to the acre and don't go near the\r\npatch till picking time next year. He gets a nice early crop, and if\r\nberries are a little small it pays better than any other way. Try it! I\r\nhave known some fields carried to fourth crop, and amateur beds kept up\r\nfor ten years. It takes lots of work to keep an old bed in good\r\ncondition. J.M. Smith, of Green Bay, Wis., almost always took one crop\r\nand plowed under. If the first crop was injured by frost, he took a\r\nsecond crop. He raised four hundred bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\nWm. Von Baumbach, of Wauwatosa, Wis., raised from five acres less ten\r\nsquare rods seventeen hundred bushels big measure beside quantities\r\ngiven the pickers. I have had beds and fields where I have timed my boys\r\npicking a quart a minute. I had one small boy that picked 230 quarts a\r\nday. But in all my sixty years growing strawberries I never properly\r\nprepared an acre of ground before planting. I could take a five acre\r\npatch now, as young as I am, and beat anything I have ever done.\r\n\r\n_Mulch._--For mulch for small beds, if straw or marsh hay is not handy,\r\nuse an inch of leaves, then cut your sweet corn and lay the stalks on\r\nthree inches apart and your plants will come up between in spring and\r\ngive you clean fruit. Cut cornstalks are good for field covering, also\r\nshredded cornstalks. I have used the begass from the cane mill, but it\r\nis too heavy. Evergreen boughs are very good if well put on for small\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nIn my paper, Vol. 1911, page 180 (Minn. Report), it should read five\r\nbushels to the square _rod, not acre_. Who ever heard of five bushels an\r\nacre!\r\n\r\n_Big Yields._--You all know of Friend Wedge's 74-3/4 quarts from one\r\nsquare rod of Everbearers the season of planting. I believe that can be\r\nbeaten. Let our society put a few hundred dollars in premiums for best\r\nyield of square rod of everbearers and of June varieties, and of a\r\nquarter of an acre; also the best product of one hill, and the best\r\nproduct of one plant, and its runners fourteen months from planting. I\r\nbelieve one plant of everbearers can produce a quart the season of\r\nsetting. I know of the five bushels to the square rod, and the other\r\nfellow had four and a half bushel of Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprise Plum a Success.\r\n\r\nC. A. PFEIFFER, WINONA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize at the outset that I am treading on delicate ground in\r\nundertaking to defend the Surprise plum, on account of it having been\r\ndiscarded by our fruit list committee, but after seeing our young trees\r\nproducing this year their third consecutive heavy crop I feel justified\r\nin taking exception to the action of the committee. My first experience\r\nwith the Surprise plum dates back to 1897, when Mr. O. M. Lord, of\r\nMinnesota City, probably the best authority on the plum in the state in\r\nhis time, presented me with one tree, which at that time were being sold\r\nat $1.00 each, and I was cautioned against giving it too much care or I\r\nwould kill the tree, and that is just what happened to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. A. Pfeiffer, Winona.]\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1898, I bought twenty-five trees from Mr. Lord and\r\nplanted them late in March, on very sandy land on a southerly slope,\r\npruning the trees back almost to a stump. These trees were very slow in\r\ngetting started but made a satisfactory growth before the season was\r\nover. They commenced to bear the third year after planting, and are\r\nstill producing good crops, but it is my more recent experience with\r\nthis variety that finally induced me to prepare this article. In the\r\nspring of 1909, we set out 160 plum trees, on rich, black, loamy soil on\r\nlow land, nineteen of them being Surprise, the other varieties being,\r\naccording to numbers, Terry, Ocheeda, Stoddard, Hawkeye, Bursota, Wolf,\r\nOmaha also a few Jewell, DeSoto, Forest Garden, American and Stella. The\r\nSurprise trees bore a crop in 1913, again in 1914, and 1915, making it\r\nto the present time not only the most productive but the most profitable\r\nvariety on our place. While we did not keep an accurate record of the\r\nexact yield in 1913 and 1914, some of the trees produced fully five 16\r\nquart cases in 1913. A fair average would perhaps be about four cases\r\nper tree. In 1914 the crop was somewhat lighter, yielding an average of\r\nthree cases per tree. This year we picked and sold eighty-five cases,\r\nwhich brought us a gross revenue of $79.60. We lost part of the crop on\r\naccount of continual rain in the picking season, or we would have had\r\nfully 100 cases. Nine of the trees being in a more sheltered location\r\nthan the other ten held their fruit better during the growing season,\r\nand produced a relatively heavier crop than the ten that were exposed to\r\nour fierce winds all summer.\r\n\r\nWe have never been able to supply the demand for them, at good prices,\r\nwhile other varieties went begging at any kind of a price. Among their\r\ngood qualities with us are productiveness, good size, extra fine quality\r\nand attractive color. They are delicious to eat out of hand just as they\r\nare ripe enough to drop from the tree. They are fine for canning,\r\npreserving or jelly. They are practically curculio proof, and have never\r\nbeen affected with brown rot as have some other varieties. Aphis never\r\nbothers them, while Terry and some other varieties nearly had the whole\r\ncrop ruined by this pest in 1914. The branches form good, strong\r\nshoulders at the trunk and do not split or break down in heavy storms or\r\nunder their heavy loads of fruit, as the Terry and Forest Garden do. The\r\nflower buds and fruit form as freely on the new growth as on the old\r\nspurs. The crop is therefore about evenly distributed all over the tree,\r\nand while we picked almost eight cases from one tree this year it did\r\nnot appear to be overloaded, as some varieties frequently are, the\r\nSurprise tree always being capable of maturing all the fruit that sets.\r\n\r\nWe have shipped them 300 miles by freight with perfect success, but we\r\npick them from the tree before fully ripe. If allowed to ripen on the\r\ntree they drop badly, which bruises and damages them. The trees are\r\nthrifty, vigorous growers with beautiful glossy foliage that can be\r\ndistinguished from all other varieties.\r\n\r\nYou would note on examination of the buds that we have promise of\r\nanother crop next year, but this will depend somewhat on the weather\r\nduring the blooming season. We attribute one of the reasons for our\r\nsuccess with the Surprise plum to the fact that they are planted among\r\nand alongside of varieties that have the same season of blooming, and\r\nwhich undoubtedly are good pollenizers, namely the Bursota, Wolf,\r\nOcheeda and Omaha. The bloom of Surprise being almost sterile, they\r\nwill not be a success planted alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Surprise plum tree growing on the place of Prof. A.G.\r\nRuggles. It bore in 1914 four bushels, having been well sprayed with\r\narsenate of lead and bordeaux mixture.]\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps ask if there are no faults or diseases they are subject\r\nto, and we will state, for one thing, the fruit drops too easily when\r\nripe, and you will either have to pick them before fully matured or find\r\na good many of them on the ground. They are also occasionally subject to\r\nblossom blight, which was rather a benefit, as it thinned the crop out\r\nto about the proper proportion. We also had considerable plum pocket and\r\nfungous growth one season about ten years ago. Such has been our\r\nexperience with the Surprise plum--and will again repeat that until the\r\nsociety finds a plum equally as good or better, instead of discarding it\r\non account of unproductiveness and recommending such poor quality\r\nvarieties as Wolf, DeSoto and some others, our learned horticulturists\r\nshould make a special study of this variety and ascertain the cause of\r\nits unproductiveness, and also to what localities in the state it may be\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nMr. Pfeiffer: Right here I will say to those gentlemen who are looking\r\nfor a cure for brown rot or curculio, they had better plant Surprise\r\nplums. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPres. Cashman: I am glad the Surprise plum has at least one good friend\r\nin this audience. I think it has several.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: What has been your experience with the Ocheeda? I see you\r\nmention it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pfeiffer: The Ocheeda at the present time, I am sorry to say, I am\r\ndisappointed with. I planted some fifteen years ago, and they were nice\r\nlarge plums, as you have described, and they were on sandy soil. I have\r\ntwenty Ocheeda trees now, and they are quite badly subject to brown rot.\r\nTheir quality is very nice to eat from the tree out of hand, nice and\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: I want to second everything Mr. Pfeiffer has said. I joined\r\nthis society about twelve years ago, and it was through studying the\r\nreports of this society that I got interested in the native plum. The\r\nSurprise plum does very well with us in Illinois. Professor Hansen is\r\none of those that are responsible for my starting in with the Surprise.\r\nIt was years ago at our state meeting that he mentioned that as one of\r\nthe good plums for Northern Illinois. Well, I put it alongside of the\r\nWyant and the native plums that are of the same sort. I may state the\r\nconditions under which we grow them. We always cultivate before bloom,\r\ncultivate thoroughly. Before the growth starts we give them a very\r\nthorough spraying with lime-sulphur spray; then just before the bloom,\r\njust before the blossoms open, as late as we can wait, we use about 1 to\r\n40 or 50 of the lime-sulphur solution, also put in three pounds of\r\narsenate of lead. Then after the blossoms fall we use the same spray\r\nagain, perhaps two weeks after that again, and we keep that up for about\r\nfour times. We have had abundant crops, and they have been very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nPres. Cashman: I am very glad to know that the Surprise plum has friends\r\nin Illinois, and we are also pleased to know that Mr. Street is with us\r\nand we hope to hear from him later. The president of the Wisconsin\r\nHorticultural Society, Mr. Rasmussen.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: I will say the Surprise plum has given just about the\r\nsame results with us--it is the most profitable we have.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I was over to the Anoka county fair; it was the first part\r\nof September, and all the other plums weren't ripe, all the stuff they\r\nhad in was green. But all the Surprise were ripe, so that certainly must\r\nbe an early ripener.\r\n\r\nMr. Pfeiffer: Not especially early.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall: I was certainly glad to hear Mr. Pfeiffer so ably defend the\r\nSurprise plum. The Surprise plum was the only one I got any good from.\r\nThe DeSoto, Wolf and Stoddard and all those, the brown rot got them, but\r\nthe Surprise plum had perfect fruit. I am surprised that it has a black\r\neye from the society.\r\n\r\nMr. Pfeiffer: Your location is where?\r\n\r\nMr. Hall: Sibley County.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Thirteen years ago I set out a root graft that made about\r\nfive feet of growth and just as quick as it got big enough to bear it\r\nwas loaded with Surprise plums, but since then it hasn't been worth a\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: If Mr. Pfeiffer had been in my orchard he could not have\r\ngiven us a better description of it than he did, of the Surprise plum. I\r\nset it out about fifteen years ago. I think I paid sixty cents for those\r\nseedlings, they stood about three and one-half feet. I never had brown\r\nrot in them. When I set them out I put them with other varieties and set\r\nthem so the inside ones would fertilize the outside ones. Afterwards I\r\nset these on the east side of the orchard, where they got protection\r\nfrom the west wind. They have borne almost every year, and this year\r\nthey are the only ones we had a crop on.\r\n\r\nPres. Cashman: I think we get as near to agreeing on this question as on\r\nmost others. It is suggested that we find out how many have had success\r\nand how many have had failures with the Surprise plum. All those who\r\nhave been successful in raising Surprise plums will please raise their\r\nhands. (Certain hands raised.) Now, hands down. Those who have been\r\nunsuccessful will please raise their right hands. (Other hands raised.)\r\nIt seems there were more successes than failures.\r\n\r\nA Member: It has been mentioned that the frost this year killed the plum\r\ncrop. I noticed in my orchard previous to that frost when we had a snow\r\nstorm, I noticed that the blossoms dried up and fell from the trees\r\nbefore that hard frost. I think the question of success or failure with\r\nthe Surprise, as with other plums, is sort of comparative. I don't know\r\nof any plum of the Americana type that we have a success with every year\r\nany more than any other. So it is relative. I would like to ask if\r\nanyone had the same experience with the blossoms drying and falling off\r\nthe trees before that frost.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford: Perhaps the gentleman will recall the fact we had two\r\nnights in succession of quite severe frost. The first night it was\r\nalmost a freeze, and the second we had the snow storm which is given\r\ncredit for the plum failure.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: The gentleman who read the paper, he is from Winona, where\r\nhe has a very much better location for any kind of fruit than the\r\ngeneral run of the state. The other gentleman is from Illinois. Now,\r\nthis good location near Winona and the temperature down in Illinois,\r\ndoes that favor the Surprise plum, and has it anything to do with their\r\nsuccess and our failure?\r\n\r\nPres. Cashman: We will have to leave that to the audience.\r\n\r\nMr. S.D. Richardson: Down in Winnebago I got three trees from the\r\noriginator of the Surprise plum, and while I was at the nursery I never\r\nsaw any plums, but I propagated some from there and a man in our town\r\nhas some Surprise plums from it, and since I left the nursery I think\r\nthe man has had some plums from them. I got them from Mr. Penning when\r\nthey were first originated, but they never bore plums for me. I had no\r\nother plums around there. Perhaps if they need pollen from other plums\r\nthey didn't get it, and this man that has had the first success with\r\nthem he had other plums near them. Perhaps that is the secret. The tree\r\nis hardy and good, and if you can get a crop of plums by having\r\nsomething else to fertilize them, the Surprise plum is all right.\r\n\r\nPres. Cashman: I think Mr. Richardson has struck the keynote to a\r\ncertain extent, we must put them near another variety to pollenize them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNortheast Demonstration Farm and Station.\r\n\r\nW. J. THOMPSON, SUPT., DULUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast May the Station orchard was set out, the same consisting of about\r\n516 apple trees with a fringe of cherries and plums. The apples\r\nconsisted of year old stock (purchased the year preceding and set in\r\nnursery rows) and included these six varieties: Duchess, Patten's\r\nGreening, Okabena, Wealthy, Hibernal, Anisim. Good growth was made the\r\npast season and the stock went into winter quarters in good shape.\r\nHowever, 20 per cent died, the loss being in this order: Wealthy,\r\nAnisim, Hibernal, Pattens' Greening--Okabena and Duchess were tied for\r\nsmallest loss. In addition to the above, we made a considerable planting\r\nof small fruits, principally currants and gooseberries, together with a\r\nlimited quantity of blackberries and raspberries. Twelve varieties of\r\nstrawberries were set out, each including 100 plants. All made a\r\nsplendid growth this season. An interesting test is under way in the\r\ndynamiting work. Alternate trees have been set in blasted holes, a stick\r\nabout one and one-half inches long being sufficient to make a hole three\r\nfeet in diameter and perhaps twenty inches in depth. It is yet too early\r\nto measure the results of this work, but owing to the nature of the\r\nsubsoil in this region, we are looking for splendid results. With regard\r\nto the stock secured from the Fruit Farm, we have not been uniformly\r\nsuccessful. Much of the stock seems to be weak and dies readily from\r\nsome cause unknown to us. Next season we should be able to render a more\r\ncomplete report, as our work will then be fairly started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, West Concord Trial Station.\r\n\r\nFRED COWLES, SUPT., WEST CONCORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fred Cowles at home.]\r\n\r\nOf the new varieties of plums that I received from the Fruit-Breeding\r\nFarm most all have done well. The only one that has borne is No. 21.\r\nThis one had two plums on last season, and several this. They were a\r\nmedium size red plum, very good flavor, and seem to come into bearing\r\nvery young. No. 17 is a very thrifty grower, but when it bears that will\r\ntell what it is worth. Hansen's plums are doing well, but we believe\r\nthey are more adapted to a better drained soil than we have here, as we\r\nare on a heavy prairie soil. But these varieties are very thrifty and\r\nbear so young.\r\n\r\nThe grapes have all stood the winter with no protection and have not\r\nkilled back any. We expect some fruit next season.\r\n\r\nThe raspberries that we received have all done well. No. 4 seems to take\r\nthe lead for flavor and is a good grower.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the cold season our strawberry crop was very good, and\r\nwe are much impressed with No. 3, it is so strong and healthy; it is\r\njust the plant for the farmer, as it will thrive under most any\r\ncondition. I believe it will fight its way with the weeds and come out\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nWe reported very favorably on the Heritage when it was in bloom, but it\r\ndoes not set enough fruit to pay for its space. The berries are large\r\nbut very few on my grounds. I will discard it.\r\n\r\nOur apple crop was very good, especially Duchess, Wealthy and\r\nNorthwestern Greening. We have been trying some of the tender varieties\r\ntop-worked. Northern Spy gave us five nice apples on a two year graft.\r\nWe also have Jonathan, Talman Sweet and King David doing well. Delicious\r\ngrafted three years ago has not fruited yet.\r\n\r\nThis has been a splendid summer for flowers, and they seemed to enjoy\r\nthe damp, cool season, especially the dahlia. If you have not tried the\r\nCountess of Lonsdale you should; it is a cactus dahlia and a very free\r\nbloomer. Everblooming roses did well--we had them in October.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPLANT LICE ON BLOSSOMS.--Aphids infesting the apple buds\r\nappeared in serious numbers during the present season in the Illinois\r\nUniversity orchards when the buds began to swell. They were also\r\nobserved in neighboring orchards. In 1914, apple aphids caused serious\r\ndamage in certain counties in Illinois, and some damage was reported\r\nfrom many sections of the state.\r\n\r\nThe aphids attack the opening buds, the young fruits, the growing\r\nshoots, and the leaves, sucking the plant juices from the succulent\r\nparts by means of long, very slender, tube-like beaks, which they thrust\r\nthrough the skins of the affected organs into the soft tissues beneath.\r\nThey weaken the blossom buds by removing the sap; they dwarf and deform\r\nthe apples so that varieties of ordinary size frequently fail to grow\r\nlarger than small crab apples, and the fruits have a puckered appearance\r\nabout the calyx end; they suck the juice from the growing shoots,\r\ndwarfing them; and they cause the leaves to curl, and if the insects are\r\npresent in large numbers, to dry up and fall off. They are more\r\ninjurious to the growth of young trees than of old trees. In old trees\r\ntheir chief injuries are on the fruit.\r\n\r\nThis species of aphids are easily killed in the adult stage by certain\r\ncontact sprays. Winter applications of lime sulphur cannot be depended\r\non to destroy eggs. Poison sprays such as arsenate of lead are not eaten\r\nby this type of insect, and consequently are ineffective remedies for\r\naphids. Kerosene emulsion is effective but is uncertain in its effect on\r\nthe foliage of the trees. The best available sprays are the tobacco\r\ndecoctions, of which the one most widely in use is \"Black Leaf 40,\" a\r\nproprietary tobacco extract, made by the Kentucky Tobacco Products\r\nCompany, Louisville, Kentucky. This material is used at the rate of one\r\ngallon in one thousand gallons of spray. It may be combined with lime\r\nsulphur, lime sulphur arsenate of lead, Bordeaux, or Bordeaux arsenate\r\nof lead, not with arsenate of lead alone.\r\n\r\nThe ideal time to spray for these aphids is just as soon as all or\r\nnearly all the eggs appear to have hatched. Observations made in the\r\nUniversity orchards this season indicate that all the eggs hatched\r\nbefore the blossom buds began to separate. After the leaves expand\r\nsomewhat and the blossom buds separate, the aphids are provided with\r\nmore hiding places and are more difficult to hit with the spray.\r\nUnfortunately, spraying at this time would require an extra application\r\nin addition to the cluster bud (first summer) spray (made for scab,\r\ncurculio, bud moth, spring canker worms, etc.), and would thus add\r\nseriously to the cost of the season's operations. Spraying for aphids at\r\nthe time of the cluster bud spray is, however, highly effective, and in\r\ngeneral it is advised that this method be followed. If, however,\r\nprevious experience has shown serious losses from aphids, or if they are\r\npresent in extremely large numbers, the extra application may be well\r\nworth while.--Ill. Agri. Exp.

Rowe, Duluth.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this was an off year for apples, results were probably as good\r\nhere as in other sections of the state. The spring gave promise of an\r\nunusual crop, but the constant dropping of fruit during the summer\r\nmonths left us with about two-thirds as many apples as were harvested in\r\n1914. The quality was much poorer, owing to extremely cool weather and\r\nthe presence of scab in many localities.\r\n\r\nThe plum crop failed almost completely, and many trees were injured from\r\naphis attacks. I have never known the aphis so hard to control as they\r\nwere last summer.\r\n\r\nNearly all fruit trees made an excellent growth this season, and the new\r\nwood was well ripened when the freeze-up came. The fall rains provided\r\nplenty of moisture, and our trees should come through the winter in\r\nexcellent shape.\r\n\r\nRaspberries and currants produced about one-half the usual crop this\r\nyear, probably owing to our May freeze.\r\n\r\nStrawberries were almost a failure, largely due to winter-killing. Last\r\nwinter did more damage to perennial plants than any other winter within\r\nthe recollection of the writer. The fall was rather dry, and our snow\r\ncovering did not come until January.\r\n\r\nWe received from Supt. Haralson for trial four plum trees, variety No.\r\n1; and fifty everbearing strawberry plants, variety No. 1017. Both plum\r\ntrees and strawberry plants made a good growth. Although the\r\nstrawberries were set heavily with fruit, but little of it ripened\r\nbefore the heavy frosts came. The plant is very vigorous, and the berry\r\nis large and of excellent quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Tenth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nM. H. HEGERLE, SUPT., ST. BONIFACIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 18th we had several inches of snow accompanied by a fierce\r\nnorthwest wind, and orchards without any shelter suffered seriously, and\r\nboth apples and plums in such orchards were scarce and of a rather\r\ninferior quality. A few orchards had a fair crop, while a couple of\r\nothers with a natural windbreak had a fairly good crop, but on an\r\naverage it was the lightest apple and plum crop we have had for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Beiersdorf and Mr. Swichtenberg report a good crop of Wealthy and\r\nPeter. Their orchards are close to a lake and are well protected on the\r\nnorth and west by a natural grove.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-four report blanks sent out, eleven were returned properly\r\nfilled in, and they all report conditions about as above outlined.\r\n\r\nCherries and grapes suffered even more from the cold than the apples,\r\nand that crop was very light. My Homer cherry trees look healthy and are\r\ngrowing fine, but the past two years had not enough fruit to supply the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nRaspberries and strawberries were a good crop and of exceptional fine\r\nquality, but the currants and gooseberries were a total failure in my\r\ngarden as well as elsewhere, according to all reports received.\r\n\r\nThere were not many fruit trees planted in this district the past year.\r\nFor instance, at this station the deliveries last spring consisted\r\nprincipally of bundles containing one-half dozen or a dozen trees each,\r\nand the total number delivered in that way did not exceed 200 trees and,\r\naccording to all information, the planting throughout this district was\r\nvery light.\r\n\r\nI know of only one new orchard started with 700 four and five year old\r\ntrees. About 500 are Wealthys and the balance Patten Greenings. The\r\ntrees made a good start but were somewhat neglected during the summer,\r\nthe field being planted to corn and some to barley, and all was handled\r\nrather rough.\r\n\r\nThere was very little blight in this district the past year. I noticed\r\njust a little on two or three Transcendents, and Mr. Jos. Boll, who has\r\nabout 1,500 bearing trees, reports no blight at all.\r\n\r\nI did no spraying this year, did not consider it worth while, as there\r\nwas no fruit, and most others felt the same way. Other years though a\r\nlot of spraying is done, and the more progressive ones spray two and\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of moisture in the soil, and the trees are going into\r\nwinter quarters in good shape, therefore prospects for apple and plum\r\ncrop the coming season are excellent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of M. H. Hegerle, St. Bonifacius.]\r\n\r\nProbably a hundred or more different kinds of apple and plum trees and\r\nberries of all kinds are grown here. Farmers in the past usually bought\r\nwhat the salesman recommended, just to get rid of him; lately though\r\nthey are taking more interest in the selection, and the Wealthy,\r\nPatten's or Northwestern Greenings, Okabena, Peter and perhaps a few\r\nDuchess are about the only apple trees planted now. Surprise plums,\r\nDunlap and everbearing strawberries are the leaders.\r\n\r\nOrnamental shrubs are found here of all names and descriptions and\r\ncolors, and they all seem to do well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHONEY VINEGAR.--Vinegar made from honey has an exceptionally\r\nfine flavor and is not expensive.

I was interested in every branch of the work\r\nand, being very much in earnest about it, I felt confident of success.\r\n\r\nThinking that the failures and drawbacks sometimes experienced could be\r\neasily overcome by a thorough understanding of the work at hand, I began\r\nby getting all the information possible. I found that great books such\r\nas by Downing, Thomas, etc., were more suitable for the advanced fruit\r\ngrower, but I studied all the pamphlets and books obtainable during the\r\nwinter months and put this knowledge into practice during the summer. Of\r\ncourse I could not put into practice all I had obtained from this\r\nreading, but I remembered distinctly the advice to all amateur fruit\r\ngrowers to start out slowly. This was particularly suited to my case,\r\nfor the land was covered with timber, some of which I grubbed each\r\nsummer, gradually adding acres as I cleared the land.\r\n\r\nMy first venture was in planting raspberries, planting potatoes between\r\nthe rows the first year. One delusion I had was in planting as many\r\ndifferent and untested varieties as I could afford to buy and not\r\nconfining myself to those that had been tried and had proven\r\nsatisfactory. Fortunately for me, the high cost of plants at this time\r\ndid not warrant my buying as many different varieties as I desired, and\r\nI had to be contented with fewer plants. From the most promising of\r\nthese, I saved all the plants possible.\r\n\r\nI had an idea that I could do better by sending to some of the Eastern\r\nstates for my plants, but here again I was mistaken, for the plants\r\noften did not arrive until late in May, and by the time they had reached\r\ntheir destination were practically all dried out. The warm weather then\r\ncoming on, I lost the greater part of them, although I had carefully\r\nhoed and tended them in the hope that they would finally revive. Here I\r\nmight also mention that the express charges added considerably to the\r\ncost of these already expensive plants.\r\n\r\nAs a beginner I put much unnecessary labor on these plants. While I do\r\nnot wish to leave the impression that hoeing and caring for them is not\r\nall right, still there should be a happy medium which I later learned as\r\nI became more experienced along this line. I must admit, however, that\r\nthis rich, new land thus cultivated certainly yielded some wonderful\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, I kept adding to my plantation, and owing to the large\r\nyield and the good demand for the black caps I took a fancy to raising\r\nthem. When the Palmer variety was first introduced, I planted quite a\r\nfield of them. I shall never forget the way these berries ripened, and\r\nsuch a lot of them as there were. Practically every one by this time\r\nhaving planted black caps, their great yield soon overstocked the\r\nmarket, and berries finally dropped as low as 65c or 70c a crate.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to dig up these black caps, I began paying closer\r\nattention to the red raspberry. I noticed that the raspberries growing\r\nwild on my place grew mostly in places where big trees had been cut down\r\nand young trees had grown up, thus partly shading the plants. Having\r\nthis fact in mind, I planted the raspberries as follows: I planted an\r\norchard, having the trees in parallel rows, and between the trees in\r\nthese same rows I planted the raspberries. By planting in this manner,\r\nthe cultivation would benefit the trees as well as the smaller plants.\r\nOf course after the trees began bearing heavily, the plants nearest the\r\ntrees had to be removed, and later the other plants likewise were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nAs a beginner it was a puzzle to me which varieties I should plant. All\r\nvarieties listed in the numerous catalogs were so highly recommended as\r\nbeing hardy, large yielders, good shippers, etc., that the selection of\r\nplants was not an easy matter.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which a new variety of raspberry is sent out over the\r\ncountry and discarded is surprising. The most popular sort at this time\r\nwas the \"Turner\" variety. I did not, however, fancy this variety, for it\r\nsuckered so immensely that it required continual hoeing to keep the new\r\nplants cut down. The berries were unusually soft and settled down in the\r\nboxes, which greatly detracted from their appearance in the crates.\r\nThere were also at this time a few of the \"Philadelphia\" variety being\r\nplanted. They are a dark, soft variety and somewhat similar to the\r\nTurner.\r\n\r\nJust at this time there was being sent out a new variety, known as the\r\nCuthbert, or Queen of the Market, and queen it was indeed. This was a\r\nlarge, firm berry, and after ripening it would remain on the plant a\r\nlong time without falling off. These plants grew up in remarkably long\r\ncanes, but not knowing how to head them back they would often topple\r\nover during a heavy storm. This added another valuable lesson to my\r\nincreasing experience, which resulted in my pinching of the new canes as\r\nsoon as they had attained a height of from three to four feet. This made\r\nthe plants more stocky and more able to support their load of berries\r\nwithout the aid of wire or stakes.\r\n\r\nNext came the Marlboro, plants of which sold at as much as a dollar\r\napiece in the east. I then set out a bed of Marlboro, which proved to be\r\neven better than the Cuthbert, previously mentioned. They could be\r\npicked while still quite light in color, thus reaching the market while\r\nstill firm and not over-ripe. There was only one possible drawback, and\r\nthat was the fact that I had planted them on a southern exposure, while\r\nthey were more adapted to a colder or northern exposure. This variety on\r\na new field, as it was, practically bore itself to death.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, there originated in Wisconsin a berry known as the\r\nLoudon. A committee of nurserymen having gone to see this variety\r\nreturned with the report that the half had not been told concerning this\r\ngreat berry. Wanting to keep up with the times, I decided to plant some\r\nof this variety in the spring. The yield from these plants was immense,\r\nand the berries large, but unlike the Marlboro already mentioned they\r\ncould not be picked until very dark and real ripe. This variety was more\r\nsubject to anthracnose than any I had seen, and served to give me a\r\nthorough understanding of the various raspberry diseases, which I had\r\nheretofore blamed to the drouth. The leaves would dry up and the berries\r\nbecome small and crumbly when affected by anthracnose. It might be said\r\nof this variety as regards public favor, that it went up like a rocket\r\nand came down equally fast.\r\n\r\nI next tried the Thompson Early as an experiment, but this variety\r\nproved a failure, or at least a disappointment. These berries ripened\r\nvery slowly, just a few at a time, and did not compare favorably with\r\neither the Marlboro or the Loudon.\r\n\r\nA party close by had at this time planted out a large field of a variety\r\nof raspberry which I had not seen before. These plants produced a large\r\nberry, more like a blackberry in appearance. Having by this time had\r\nexperience with so many kinds of raspberries, I examined this new\r\nvariety carefully, and all in all decided that this was the coming\r\nberry. Here, too, I also noticed the first signs of disease. The plants\r\nhad only begun to bear fruit, however, and judging from the strong,\r\ntall canes, they looked good for at least fifteen years. This disease,\r\nhowever, practically destroyed the entire field within two years. Before\r\ntoo badly diseased, I had obtained and planted out a couple of acres of\r\nthese plants and immediately began spraying them. The following spring I\r\nsprayed them again, and although the plants became perfectly healthy, I\r\nsprayed them once or twice during the summer, and it is needless to say\r\nthe result was a berry which, considering all its good points, was\r\ncertainly deserving of the name it bore, which was \"King.\" In fact, I do\r\nnot hope to see anything better in the raspberry line during the next\r\nthirty years, that is, any seedling having all its merits: a strong\r\ngrowth, hardiness of cane, an immense bearer and a good shipper. It's\r\nonly fault is that the berries will drop from the plants when real ripe,\r\nbut if you are on the job this can easily be averted.\r\n\r\nAs far as anthracnose is concerned, I have found that there is not a\r\nvariety of raspberry standing out in an open field, unsprayed or partly\r\nshaded, that will stand up under a heavy crop without being affected by\r\nthis disease.\r\n\r\nAfter increasing my plantation, as I had by this time, I found I\r\nrequired more help. Ability in managing my helpers was a necessity. My\r\nexperience with them in the field was that when I set them to hoeing a\r\nnewly set raspberry field if not watched they would destroy half the\r\nroots, loosening the little hold the struggling plants had, by cutting\r\nclose and hoeing the soil away from the roots. I have seen supposedly\r\nintelligent men plowing alongside of the plants, thinking they were\r\ndoing their work so much more thoroughly, but if they would dig up one\r\nplant before plowing and another after, they would readily see the\r\nresults of their plowing.\r\n\r\nA born farmer assumes that everybody knows how to handle a hoe or a\r\nplow, but why should they, not having had practical experience? When put\r\nto work such as hoeing, they would make the most outlandish motions with\r\nthe hoe, often destroying valuable plants, not being able to distinguish\r\nthem from the weeds. Though they may labor just as hard, they cannot\r\npossibly accomplish as much as the expert who can skillfully whirl a hoe\r\naround a plant in such a manner as to remove every weed and yet not\r\ninjure the plant in the least. In other words, the best efforts of the\r\nnovice cannot possibly bring the results so easily accomplished by the\r\nmore skillful laborer. Except in a few cases, I have found inexperienced\r\nhelp a discouragement.\r\n\r\nIn hiring pickers who had to come quite far each morning, I found that\r\nif the morning had been wet and rainy, but had later turned out to be a\r\nnice day, they would not come at all. The sun coming out after these\r\nshowers would cause the berries to become over-ripe and to drop from the\r\nbushes, or if still on the bush would be too ripe for shipping. These\r\nsame pickers, when berries were scarce, would rush through the rows,\r\nmerely picking the biggest and those most easily acquired.\r\n\r\nHaving tried pickers as mentioned, I decided that to get pickers from\r\nthe city and board them would be the better plan. While they seemed to\r\nwork more for the pleasure connected with life on the farm than with the\r\nidea of making money, yet after a little training and a few rules, most\r\nof them would make splendid pickers, and my berries being carefully\r\npicked and in first class condition, would readily sell to the best\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nLeaving the subject of berries and berry picking, I will dwell briefly\r\non my experience with the winter covering of the plants. At first I\r\nwould cover the canes in an arch-like manner, which would require more\r\nthan 18 inches of soil to cover them, and it was necessary to shovel\r\nmuch by hand. In the spring I found it quite a task to remove all this\r\nsoil and get it back in place between the rows. After I learned to cover\r\nthem properly, that is flat on the ground, I found it required but a\r\nsmall amount of soil to cover them, and in the spring it was only\r\nnecessary to use a fork to remove the covering, and with a little lift\r\nthey were ready to start growth again.\r\n\r\nAfter getting more and more fruit, I found I could not dispose of it in\r\nthe home market, and tending to the picking and packing of the fruit did\r\nnot leave enough time to warrant my peddling it. I had been advised to\r\nship my berries to two or three different commission houses in order to\r\nsee where I could obtain the best results. I frequently divided my\r\nshipments into three parts: consequently some of my fruit would meet in\r\ncompetition with another lot of my fruit, and not only would one concern\r\nask a higher or lower price than the other, but they would not know when\r\nto expect my shipments, which they would receive on alternate days. I\r\nfinally came to the conclusion that I would send all my fruit to one\r\nparty, and I found that it was not only more of an object to them, but\r\npeople would come every day to buy some, knowing they were getting the\r\nsame quality each time.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been my experience that the raspberry is never a\r\nfailure, still I have found that it is a good policy not to depend\r\nentirely on the raspberry, but to extend the plantation in such a way as\r\nto have a continuous supply of fruits and vegetables in season, from the\r\nasparagus and pie plant of the early spring to the very latest variety\r\nof the grape and apple ripening just before the heavy frost of fall,\r\nwhen it is again time to tuck them all away for the winter.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Do I understand that you have to lay down and cover up those\r\nred raspberries?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes, sir; otherwise you only get a few berries right at the\r\ntop of the cane, and if you cover them the berries will be all along\r\ndown the cane.\r\n\r\nThe President: Do you break off many canes by covering them?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: No, it is the way you bend them. When you bend them down,\r\nmake a kind of a twist and hold your hand right near them. You can bend\r\nthem down as quick as a couple of men can shovel them down.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: Do you bend them north or south or any way?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I generally bend one row one way and the other the other\r\nway. Where you want to cultivate, it is easier for cultivation; you\r\ndon't have to go against the bend of those plants. That bend will never\r\nbe straight again, and when you come to cultivate you are liable to rub\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: How far have you got yours planted apart?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: About five feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What is your best raspberry?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I haven't seen anything better than the King.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Do you cover the King?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: We don't do it on the experimental station. I never covered\r\nmine, and I think I had the best all around berry last summer.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: That might be all right when they are young, but I find it\r\npays me.\r\n\r\nA Member: Don't they form new branches on the sides when you pinch off\r\nthe ends?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes, sir; then you pinch them off.\r\n\r\nA Member: Don't they break right off from the main stalk in laying down?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: No, no.\r\n\r\nA Member: We have a great deal of trouble with that. How do you get\r\nthese bushy bushes to lie down?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I take three or four canes, and kind of twist them, give\r\nthem a little twist, and lay them flat on the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: Don't you take out any dirt on the sides?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: No, sir; sometimes I might put a shovel of ground against\r\nthem to bend the canes over.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers: Do you plant in the hedge row or in the hill system?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: In the hedge row. I think it is better because they protect\r\none another.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: How far do you put them apart in the hedge row?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Four feet. That is the trouble with the King, if you don't\r\nkeep them down, your rows will get too wide.\r\n\r\nA Member: I heard you say a while ago you covered these. Do you plow\r\nthem after you get them down or do you cover them with a shovel?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I cover mostly with a shovel. Sometimes I take a small plow\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nA Member: Don't you think in covering them with a plow you might disturb\r\nthe roots?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: That is the danger.\r\n\r\nA Member: I saw a fellow covering up twelve acres of black caps and he\r\nplowed them shut. After I heard what you said I thought maybe that he\r\nwas injuring his roots.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: You know the black cap has a different root system from the\r\nreds. The roots of the reds will run out all over the road.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard: How thick do you leave those canes set apart in the row,\r\nhow many in a foot?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I generally try to leave them in hills four feet apart, not\r\nlet them come in any between. About three or four in a hill. I generally\r\ntry to cut out the weak ones.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard: You pinch the end of the tops, I think?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nA Member: When do you cut those sucker canes?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I generally hoe them just before picking time and loosen\r\nthe ground in the row. That is very important, to give them a hoeing,\r\nnot hoe down deep, but just loosen that hard crust there and cut all the\r\nplants that you don't want, and then generally, after the berries\r\ncommence to ripen, your suckers don't come so fast, and you keep on\r\ncultivating once in a while.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: I have some King raspberries, and I never covered them up\r\nin ten years. I will change that. The first year I did cover a part of\r\nmy patch, at least one-half of them, and that left the other half\r\nstanding, and I couldn't see any difference. Around Excelsior there are\r\nvery few people that cover up the King raspberry. But the King raspberry\r\nhas run out; all of the old varieties have run out. We have at our\r\nexperiment station the No. 4--you can get double the amount of fruit\r\nfrom the No. 4 than from the King. The best way to grow the King\r\nraspberry or any other raspberry is to set them four feet apart and\r\ncultivate them. If you grow a matted row you are bound to get weeds and\r\ngrass in there, you are bound to get them ridged up, but by planting in\r\nhills and cultivating each way you can keep your ground perfectly level.\r\nAs far as clipping them back my experience has been it is very hard to\r\nhandle them--they will spread out. It is a big job to cover the plants\r\nand then to uncover them again. I know it is not necessary with the No.\r\n4; that is hardy. That is what we want. Hardiness is what we want in a\r\nberry, and you have it in the No. 4.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall: I would like to ask you what you spray with and when you\r\nspray?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: The bordeaux mixture. I spray them early in the spring and\r\njust before they start to ripen.\r\n\r\nMr. Wick: With us the Loudon raspberry seems to be the coming raspberry.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Is it doing well now?\r\n\r\nMr. Wick: Yes, it is doing well.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: How many years is the planting of the King raspberry good\r\nfor?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I think it would be good for fifteen years or more if they\r\nare handled as I do it. Keep at the plant, hoeing and spraying them\r\ntwice a year; trim out the old wood and keep them healthy.\r\n\r\nThe President: You take out all the old wood every year?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: When do you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: In the fall. I figure this way, every extra cane that you\r\ngrow on the plant is a waste. If I see a cane a little higher than the\r\nothers I just stop it, and it throws the sap back.\r\n\r\nMr. Berry: Do you fertilize and how and when?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I found I didn't need much fertilizer. I put on wood ashes\r\nand such things when I burn the trimming of the berries and such things.\r\n\r\nA Member: When do you spray?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I generally spray in the spring after they get started and\r\njust before they are starting to ripen. I spray them sometimes when they\r\nare starting to ripen, and the berries would pick up in one day.\r\n\r\nA Member: You mean to say you could grow them for fifteen years without\r\nfertilizing?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE of the temperature of the pantry and cellar is\r\nimportant, in order that one may make improvements in conditions.\r\nPutrefaction will start at 50°, so that a pantry or closet where food is\r\nkept should have a temperature at least as low as that.

In\r\nregard to raspberries, Nos. 1, 4 and 7 did very well, and stood the\r\nwinter without laying down, and bore a good crop.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the eighteen plum trees I received three years ago, Nos. 1,\r\n4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 have done very well and have made a good growth, but\r\nhave had no fruit so far.\r\n\r\nThe sand cherry that was received the same year, No. 2, has done very\r\nwell and bore some fruit this last year of a fair quality.\r\n\r\nHansen cherries are doing fairly well and bore some fruit this year.\r\n\r\nNow in regard to plums that were received in 1914 Nos. 2, 3, 8, 10, 13,\r\n20, have all made a good growth. What was received in 1915 have all\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nThe grapes that we received two years ago have made but little growth.\r\nThere were no grapes in this section this year; they all froze off about\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nI received at the county fair about sixteen first prizes on apples and\r\nplums this year. We did considerable top-working, mostly on Hibernals\r\nand native seedlings, which are doing very well. Some of our seedling\r\ncherries are commencing to bear and show to be perfectly hardy. They are\r\nof the Oregon strain of sweet cherry.\r\n\r\nIn regard to gardens, they were fairly good throughout the section. Corn\r\ncrop a failure.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the condition of the trees and shrubbery, this are going\r\ninto their winter quarters with lots of moisture and with a large amount\r\nof fruit buds, with a good prospect for fruit next year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDESTROYING PLANT LICE.--According to the results of experiments\r\na 10 per cent kerosene emulsion should prove effective against the green\r\napple aphis. The kerosene emulsion made either with 66 per cent stock,\r\n10 per cent, or with naphtha soap and cold water, seemed to kill all the\r\ngreen apple aphides. The 40 per cent nicotine solution, with a dilution\r\nup to 1 to 2,000 combined with soap, were likewise effective\r\naphidicides. The kerosene emulsions under 10 per cent were not\r\nsatisfactory, neither were the soaps at the strengths tested, except\r\nthat fish-oil soap, 5 to 50, killed 90 per cent of the aphides. Laundry\r\nsoap, 3 to 50, was effective against the young aphides only. Arsenate of\r\nlead alone, as was to be expected, had little or no effect upon the\r\naphides. The combination of arsenate of calcium with kerosene emulsions\r\nis not a desirable one, since an insoluble calcium soap is formed,\r\nthereby releasing some free kerosene.--U.S. Dpt. of Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Fruits Originated at Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm.\r\n\r\nCHAS. HARALSON, SUPT., EXCELSIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject on which I am to talk is rather difficult to present at this\r\ntime, but I will mention a few of the most promising new varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The new and valuable hardy raspberry No. 4, growing at\r\nState Fruit-Breeding Farm.]\r\n\r\nWe have developed several hundred new varieties of fruit since we\r\nstarted fruit-breeding at the State Fruit Farm. Many of them are very\r\npromising, but it probably will take several years before we really know\r\nwhat we have that will be of value to the public.\r\n\r\nWe have been growing thousands of seedlings of apples, plums, grapes,\r\nraspberries, strawberries, gooseberries and currants, from which\r\nvaluable varieties have been selected. All of them have been put under\r\npropagation in a small way for testing at the Fruit Farm, trial\r\nstations and many other places. Some very favorable reports from several\r\nplaces have been received during the last year from parties who have\r\nfruited these new creations. We also have some hybrid peach and apricot\r\nseedlings which have stood the test of the last two winters. Some of\r\nthem blossomed very freely last spring, but on account of the hard\r\nfreeze in May they did not set any fruit. I hope to be able to report on\r\nthese another year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hybrid plum No. 21--at Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding\r\nFarm.]\r\n\r\nThe results of breeding strawberries have given us one everbearing and\r\none June-bearing variety, which have been tested in many places\r\nthroughout the state. The June-bearing variety has been introduced as\r\nMinnesota No. 3. The berries are almost identical with Senator Dunlap in\r\ncolor and shape, but somewhat larger and, I think, more productive. The\r\nplants are equal to Dunlap in hardiness, or more so, a stronger plant,\r\nand a good plant-maker. The fruiting season is about a week earlier than\r\nDunlap. It is a firm berry and stands shipping a long distance. My\r\nbelief is that this variety will make one of the best commercial berries\r\nfor the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe everbearing variety is known as No. 1017. It is a large, round\r\nberry, dark red color, and is of the best quality. This variety is\r\nstrong and vigorous and a good plant-maker when blossoms are picked off\r\nearly in the season. It is also very productive. The blossoms and\r\nberries on a number of plants were counted in October, and we found all\r\nthe way from 200 to 345 berries and blossoms on single plants. This is,\r\nof course, a little more than the average, but it shows what it will do\r\nunder ordinary conditions. This variety has been growing next to\r\nProgressive, on the same soil, with the same cultivation, and I think\r\nthat persons who have seen it this summer will agree with me that it is\r\nfar ahead of Progressive in size and productiveness. I will say right\r\nhere, if you expect to have a good crop of fruit in the fall, keep the\r\nmost of the runners off. If you encourage them to make runners, or\r\nplants, you will have less fruit.\r\n\r\nThe raspberries sent out as Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, are all worthy\r\nof trial. The No. 4 has fruited several years and gave the best showing\r\nso far. The fruit resembles the Marlboro somewhat, but the color is\r\ndarker. It is not one of very high quality, but the size of the berry\r\nand its appearance will more then make up for this. The canes and\r\nfoliage are generally healthy and very hardy. This variety will be\r\nplanted very extensively just as soon as enough stock can be supplied to\r\nfruit growers.\r\n\r\nThe Burbank crossed with Wolf, hybrid plums. There have been several of\r\nthese sent out to trial stations, and as premiums to members of the\r\nHorticultural Society. I will mention them in order as to size of fruit.\r\nNo. 5, 12, 4, and 6 will measure 1-3/4 inch in diameter. Nos. 21, 10,\r\n17, 9, and No. 1 are nearly as large. The kinds which have given best\r\nall around satisfaction up to the present time, are Nos. 1, 6, 9, 10,\r\n12, 17, 21 and 25. One or two years more trial should give us an idea\r\nwhich ones will be worthy of general propagation.\r\n\r\nThere are also several varieties of Abundance and Wolf crosses which\r\nhave fruited for several years. The quality of the fruit of these\r\nhybrids is probably somewhat better than the Burbank and Wolf hybrids,\r\nbut the fruit in most cases runs smaller. No. 35 is probably one of the\r\nbest; its fruit is about 1-1/2 inch in diameter, colors up all over\r\nbefore it is ripe, and will stand shipping a long distance, as they can\r\nbe picked quite green and still are colored up all over. There are\r\nseveral numbers equally, or nearly, as promising as No. 35.\r\n\r\nSand cherry X Satsuma plum No. 145 is in the same class as Sapa. The\r\ncolor of the fruit is bluish black when ripe, the flesh purple, pit\r\nsmall and nearly freestone; fruit ripens first part of August. This tree\r\nis a strong grower and makes a large tree. We also have another plum,\r\nCompass cherry X Climax, about the only variety which fruited this year.\r\nThe color of the skin is almost blue when fully ripe; the meat is green\r\nand of a very pleasant flavor. The pit is small and clingstone; size of\r\nfruit is about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. The tree is a strong, upright\r\ngrower. This variety has been propagated this summer. I will not try to\r\ndescribe any more as there are some 2,000 hybrid plums on the place and\r\nonly a small per cent have fruited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ornamental Purple Leaf Plum, originated at State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm.]\r\n\r\nIn grapes we have several varieties worthy of propagation, but I will\r\njust mention two varieties. One is a red grape about the size of Wyoming\r\nRed. The bunches are large and very compact; the season for ripening is\r\nabout with Moore's Early; the quality is good enough to make it a table\r\ngrape. The vine is just as hardy as Beta grape, of which it is a\r\nseedling. It has good foliage and the vine is a rank grower. The other\r\nvariety is black when ripe, nearly as large as Moore's Early. The fruit\r\nis ripe first part of August; the vine is vigorous and hardy.\r\n\r\nStrawberries and raspberries were a good crop this year, but all other\r\nfruit was a total failure on account of the killing frost and snowstorm\r\non May 18th. Apples were in full bloom at the time, and a good crop of\r\nplums had set on the trees, but all fell off a few days later. There\r\nwere no currants or gooseberries and only a few grapes.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: What do you think the male parent was of the red grape?\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: I couldn't say. We don't know what the cross is.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: Did you have any red grapes growing there?\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: I presume there were quite a number of varieties growing\r\nnear by. In the Beta seedlings we find a number of grapes that ripen\r\ngreen and also some black and a number red, but not a great many, I\r\nwould say from five to seven per cent of the seedlings.\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: Have you been able to cross the European plum with the\r\nJapanese?\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: We have one or two varieties, but the fruit is very small,\r\nthe fruit isn't very much larger than the Compass cherry. The tree is a\r\nvery strong grower and makes a large tree, but the fruit is not up to\r\nwhat it should be.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: What number do you hold that red grape under?\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: The red grape is No. 1.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Which is the next best raspberry besides the No. 4?\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: I couldn't tell you at present. I thought the No. 2, but\r\nfrom reports I have had from several places some think No. 1 is better.\r\nNo. 4 is the best of them all so far.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask which of those raspberries is the best\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nMr. Haralson: They run very much the same, very little difference in the\r\nquality. The quality I should say compares very favorably with the King.\r\n\r\nThe President: Those of you who know of the wonderful work done by Mr.\r\nHaralson can not help but say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\"\r\nHe has surely accomplished wonderful results out there, and the people\r\nof this state and adjoining states will all in time enjoy the fruits of\r\nhis labor. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKILL WILD ONIONS IN NOVEMBER.--The secret of the vitality of\r\nthe wild onion lies in the two sorts of underground bulbs. Each plant\r\nproduces one large bulb, which germinates in the fall, and four or five\r\nsmall ones, which start growth in the spring.\r\n\r\nLate fall plowing, followed by early spring plowing and planting the\r\ninfested land to some clean cultivated crop destroys the wild onion pest\r\nby killing both sorts of bulbs as the growth from them appears and\r\nbefore they have a chance to multiply. The fall plowing should be deep,\r\nand care should be taken to completely bury all green tops of the onion.\r\nIf very much top growth has been made, a harrow run before the plow will\r\nfacilitate the thorough covering of the tops.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and valuable point about the wild onion is that the\r\nspring bulbs rarely produce heads; consequently, if the infested land is\r\nplowed in the fall, a spring oat crop practically free of onions can\r\nalways be secured. But for complete eradication of the onion, both fall\r\nand spring plowing is necessary, and November is the best time to do the\r\nfall work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Meeting, 1915, Wisconsin Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nCHAS. HARALSON, EXCELSIOR, MINN., DELEGATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held January 5, 6 and 7, 1915, in the Assembly Room of\r\nthe State Capitol in Madison, Wis. Your delegate was present in time for\r\nthe opening session and given a chance with other delegates to deliver\r\nthe greetings of their societies.\r\n\r\nThe opening address by Governor Phillip was very interesting. He told of\r\nthe possibilities the State of Wisconsin offered fruit growers in a\r\ncommercial way with markets all around them. He advocated honest grading\r\nand packing to obtain the top prices for the fruit. He also urged every\r\nfarmer to have a small orchard and fruit garden for home consumption.\r\n\r\nSpraying and spray mixtures, illustrated, was ably presented by\r\nProfessor Geo. F. Potter, University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nA speaking contest by ten students from University of Wisconsin competed\r\nfor prizes of $25.00, $15.00 and $10.00. This brought out almost every\r\nphase of horticulture and was one of the most interesting sessions.\r\n\r\nCommercial orcharding in the middle west was shown with moving pictures\r\nand explanations by Sen. Dunlap, Savoy, Ill. These pictures illustrated\r\nspraying, cultivating, harvesting, grading, packing, caring for the\r\nfruit and marketing the same, and several other operations in connection\r\nwith uptodate commercial orcharding. He also gave a talk on spraying and\r\nspraying materials. He said lime-sulphur is preferred in his locality.\r\n\r\nA half hour question and answer session was led by Professor J.G. Moore,\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin, on pruning. This brought out a very lively\r\ndiscussion about how to prune young orchards and what age of trees to\r\nplant for commercial orchards. This question was not settled, as some\r\npreferred one year old trees, while others would plant nothing but two\r\nyear old trees.\r\n\r\nM. S. Kellogg, Janesville, Wis., spoke of nurserymen's troubles. His\r\npaper was very interesting from a nurseryman's standpoint with all their\r\ntroubles and what they have to go up against.\r\n\r\nC. O. Ruste, Blue Mounds, Wis., spoke about the farmer's orchard, what to\r\nplant and how to care for the same.\r\n\r\nThe writer gave a paper, telling what is being done in the line of\r\nfruit-breeding at the Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm.\r\n\r\nThe program was very full and interesting. The attendance, however, was\r\nnot very large. A very good exhibit of apples was on display in the\r\nfruit room. The fruit was clean, well colored and up to size. Many\r\nvarieties, such as Jonathan, Fameuse, Baldwin, Windsor, Talman Sweet and\r\nWine Sap were on display in great quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting the following officers and members of the\r\nExecutive Committee were elected.\r\n\r\nOfficers--Mrs. E. W. Gould, President, 2644 Humboldt Ave. S.,\r\nMinneapolis; Mrs. Phelps Wyman, Vice-President, 5017 Third Ave. S.,\r\nMinneapolis; Mrs. M.L. Countryman, Secretary-Treasurer, 213 S. Avon St.,\r\nSt. Paul.\r\n\r\nDirectors--Mrs. F. H. Gibbs, St. Anthony Park; Mr. G. C. Hawkins,\r\nMinneapolis; Miss Elizabeth Starr, Minneapolis; Mrs. H. A. Boardman, St.\r\nPaul; Mr. F. W. Bell, Wayzata; Mr. F. F. Farrar, White Bear; Mrs. R. P.\r\nBoyington, Nemadji; Mrs. J. F. Fairfax, Minneapolis; Mrs. H. B. Tillotson,\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough discussion, it was unanimously agreed that more\r\nfrequent meetings would be advisable. Our program committee has,\r\ntherefore, planned for a meeting each month, alternating between St.\r\nPaul and Minneapolis. It was, of course, impossible to set the dates for\r\nthe three flower shows so early in the year, or to announce all of the\r\nspeakers. The program in full for each month will appear on this page,\r\nand we hope to save our secretary a great deal of routine work as well\r\nas considerable postage to the society. So watch this page for\r\nannouncements. We hope the following program will prove both interesting\r\nand profitable, and that our members will bring friends to each meeting,\r\nall of which will begin at 2:30 o'clock _promptly_.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM FOR 1916.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24.

GOULD,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN.\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN BEES FOR BREEDING.--Queen bees for breeding purposes will\r\nbe sent to beekeepers of the State from University Farm during the\r\ncoming summer with instructions how to introduce them and how to\r\nre-queen the apiary. Mostly all bees in the state at present are\r\nhybrids, which are hard to manage. In many localities bees have been\r\ninbred for years, making the introduction of new blood a necessity. All\r\nqueens sent out are bred from the leather colored Italian breeding\r\nqueens of choicest stock obtainable. The price of queens will be fifty\r\ncents for one, and not more than three will be furnished to each\r\nbeekeeper. Orders with cash must be sent directed to the \"Cashier,\"\r\nUniversity Farm, St. Paul, Minnesota. The queens will be sent out in\r\nrotation as soon as they are ready and conditions are right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERSHIP NUMBERS CHANGE.--A good many members when sending in\r\nannual membership fee give the number of their membership for the\r\nprevious year. Members will please note that membership numbers change\r\neach year, as all members are numbered in the order of their coming upon\r\nthe membership roll. The only number that we care about in the office,\r\nif for any reason it is necessary to give it, is the number for the\r\ncurrent year.\r\n\r\nA WORD FROM PROF. WHITTEN.--Prof. J. C. Whitten, of the\r\nUniversity of Missouri, who was on the program at our annual meeting for\r\nthree numbers, and at the last moment was taken ill and unable to be\r\nwith us, has written describing the condition of his illness and\r\nexpressing his deep regret at his enforced absence from our meeting, and\r\na hope that at some other time he may have an opportunity to be with us.\r\nWe shall look forward to having him on our program another year with\r\neager anticipation. Prof. Whitten ranks as one of the most prominent of\r\nprofessional horticulturists of the country, and we are certainly\r\nfortunate in being able to secure his attendance, as we hope to do\r\nanother year.\r\n\r\nMEMBERS IN FLORIDA.--Quite a number of members of the\r\nHorticultural Society are spending the winter in Florida. Some of these\r\nthe secretary knows about, but addresses of only two are at hand. J. M.\r\nUnderwood, chairman of the executive board of the society, and family\r\nare at Miami, Fla., for the winter. Mr. Oliver Gibbs, at one time\r\nsecretary of the society for a number of years, is at Melbourne Beach,\r\non the east coast of Florida, where he has been now for some ten\r\nwinters--and some summers also. His health makes it necessary for him to\r\nlive in so mild a climate. We have the pleasure of meeting him here\r\noften during the summer. Now in his eighties he is nearly blind but\r\notherwise in good health and always in cheerful spirits.\r\n\r\nNEW LIFE MEMBERS.--Since the report of 1915 was printed, in\r\nwhich there will be found on page 520 a list of life members of the\r\nsociety, there have been added to the life membership roll fifteen\r\nnames; five of these were made honorary members by the unanimous vote of\r\nthe association for valuable service rendered to the society, and were\r\nwell deserving of this honor, as follows: Chas. Haralson, Excelsior;\r\nS. H. Drum, Owatonna; F. W. Kimball, Waltham; J. R. Cummins, Minneapolis;\r\nJohn Bisbee, Madelia.\r\n\r\nTo the paid life membership roll there have been added ten names as\r\nfollows: E. G. Zabel, LaMoure, N.D.; Roy E. McConnell, St. Cloud; O. F.\r\nKrueger, Minneapolis; L.A. Gunderson, Duluth; Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Gibbs,\r\nSt. Anthony Park; Herman Goebel, Wildrose, N.D.; T. Torgerson, Estevan,\r\nSask.; Law Swanson, St. Paul; Rev. Saml. Johnson, Princeton.\r\n\r\nDon't you want your name added to this life roll? If you have already\r\npaid an annual membership fee for this year a further payment of $4.00\r\nmade any time during the year will be received as first payment for a\r\nlife membership fee. That is, the amount of the annual fee already paid\r\nmay be deducted from a life membership fee paid any time during the\r\ncurrent year.\r\n\r\nSEND IN A NEW MEMBER.--Have you noticed the advertisement on\r\nthe inside of the back cover page of this and also the January issues of\r\nour monthly? There never was such an opportunity to secure valuable new\r\nfruits as this presents to you and to your neighbor, many of whom we\r\nfeel sure would gladly take advantage of the opportunity if it were\r\npresented to them. Take an evening off and do yourself and your\r\nneighbors this good service--and the society as well.\r\n\r\nNUMBER THREE STRAWBERRY.--Very few of those who have so far\r\nselected plant premiums for next spring's delivery have chosen Minnesota\r\nNo. 3 June-bearing strawberry. Our members will surely make a mistake if\r\nthey do not secure for next spring's planting a quantity of this\r\nsplendid new berry, which seems likely to supplant the Senator Dunlap as\r\nthe June-bearing variety in the near future. It is a very vigorous\r\ngrower, equally attractive, of good quality, holds up well and is a\r\nhealthy, hardy plant. Do not leave this out of your list of selection\r\nfor plant premiums.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SEED OF LARGE VALUE.--A considerable quantity of apple\r\nseed has been secured of Mr. John Bisbee, of Madelia, Minn., from his\r\norchard, top-worked, as it is, with many varieties of long keeping\r\napples, so that this seed is almost certainly crossed with something\r\nthat will keep well as well as of high quality. It will be found\r\nespecially valuable to plant for growing seedlings. It would be well to\r\nsecure this seed soon, mix it with damp sand and leave out of doors\r\nwhere it will freeze, keeping the package which holds it covered from\r\nthe air so that it may not dry out. Every member should have a little\r\ncorner in his garden for growing apple seedlings. It is an enticing\r\nexperiment, and such seed as this is likely to give good results. We are\r\nstill looking for the $1,000 apple. You may grow it from some of this\r\nseed. Package of twenty-five seed at ten cents, to be secured of Secy.\r\nLatham.\r\n\r\nA FAVORABLE WINTER FOR FRUITS.--The ground was in good\r\ncondition last fall, with a reasonable amount of moisture, fruits, both\r\ntrees and plants, well ripened up, and now with a fairly good blanket of\r\nsnow and no long continued severe weather, we have to this point in the\r\nwinter a very certain assurance of a good yield of fruit the coming\r\nspring. To be sure the thermometer was down in the neighborhood of\r\nthirty degrees one night, but it was there so short a time that it\r\nscarcely seems possible that any harm could have been done by it. The\r\nhorticulturist should be a natural optimist and always anticipate\r\nsomething good ahead, which is one pretty sure way of getting it.\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA NURSERYMEN GIVE MEMBERSHIPS.--A considerable number\r\nof the nurserymen of Minnesota are again giving memberships this year as\r\npremiums to purchasers of nursery stock in quantity of $20.00 or\r\nupwards. This is a commendable enterprise, not only on account of its\r\nmaterial assistance in building up the membership roll of the society\r\nbut more especially because it brings in the kind of members who have,\r\nor should have, a large practical interest in the workings of the\r\nassociation, and we believe also that it is like \"casting bread upon the\r\nwaters;\" those receiving these memberships will have a warm feeling for\r\nthe nurserymen which present them. If you who read this are Minnesota\r\nnurserymen and are not in the list of those who are doing this service\r\nfor the society, don't you want to take advantage of an immediate\r\nopportunity to align yourself with those who are showing so large an\r\ninterest in the welfare of the association?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING THE APPLE CROP IN HAROLD SIMMONS'\r\nORCHARD--AT HOWARD LAKE.]\r\n\r\n     While it is not the intention to publish anything in this\r\n     magazine that is misleading or unreliable, yet it must be\r\n     remembered that the articles published herein recite the\r\n     experience and opinions of their writers, and this fact must\r\n     always be noted in estimating their practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST\r\n\r\nVol. 44 MARCH, 1916 No. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Orchard Crop of 1915 from Start to Finish.\r\n\r\nHAROLD SIMMONS, ORCHARDIST, HOWARD LAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of a crop of apples for 1915 we commenced the season\r\nwith the regular annual pruning in March. We begin pruning as soon after\r\nthe 25th day of February as the weather is mild enough for us to work\r\ncomfortably, as the pruning of fifteen hundred trees requires\r\nconsiderable time when one is obsessed with the idea that nothing short\r\nof a first class job will do, and that to be accomplished mainly by the\r\nefforts of one individual.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored to grow our trees so that they should all have from\r\nthree to five or six main limbs, and any tendency of a limb to assume\r\nthe leadership is suppressed. A tree grown upon this principle has the\r\nfaculty of growing a great many laterals, necessitating an annual\r\npruning. As far as possible we prune to prevent laterals from becoming\r\ntoo numerous, from growing so as to overtop or shade lower limbs, to let\r\nin light and sunshine, so as to get the maximum amount of color on the\r\nfruit and in a measure to help in thinning the fruit. Having in view the\r\nidea of an annual crop instead of a biennial one, one essential point\r\nalways in mind is that we want an open headed tree, and we also wish to\r\ninsure our trees against blight, and so we eliminate all water sprouts.\r\nApparently, no Minnesota orchard is immune against blight.\r\n\r\nSome objections are raised to this type of tree, one criticism being\r\nthat the tree is structurally weak from the fact that if one limb breaks\r\noff at the trunk the tree is about ruined. We offset the possibility of\r\nsuch a break by careful training and by wiring the trees, a plan I\r\ngathered some years ago from a Mr. Mason, at that time president of the\r\nFlood River Apple Growers Association.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young trees in full bloom in Mr. Simmons' orchard.]\r\n\r\nWe use No. 14 galvanized wire, a half inch galvanized harness ring, and\r\nscrew-eyes with stout shanks and small eyes. Locating up the main limbs\r\nwhat might be called the center of effort, or where the main pull would\r\nbe when loaded with fruit, put in a good stout screw-eye in every main\r\nlimb, eyes all pointing to the center of the tree, and then wire them\r\nall to the harness ring in the middle of the tree. When finished the\r\nring and the wires are like the hub in a wheel with the spokes all\r\naround. We tried this first on our N.W. Greening trees, and results were\r\nso satisfactory that we have applied it to a great number of other\r\nvarieties with equal satisfaction. Once put in a tree, it is good for\r\nthe life of the tree.\r\n\r\nOur objection to a tree with a central leader is that it is very\r\ndifficult to create an open head, and if the blight strikes the leader\r\nit generally means the loss of the tree. Low headed trees we have found\r\nby experience, are easiest cared for; they are the most economical for\r\nthinning, harvesting, spraying and pruning; they also shade the trunk\r\nand main limbs.\r\n\r\nAfter pruning all brush is removed from the orchard and burned.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is spraying, and our first spraying was done when\r\nmost of the petals were down, using a Cushman power sprayer, running at\r\ntwo hundred pounds pressure, with two leads of hose and extension rods\r\nwith two nozzles on each. Spraying solution, six gallons of lime and\r\nsulphur, twelve pounds of arsenate of lead paste to each tank of water\r\ncontaining two hundred gallons. We aim to cover the tree thoroughly from\r\ntop to bottom and spray twice each season. However, the past season half\r\nthe orchard only was sprayed twice, the other half only once, the second\r\nspraying being applied about two weeks after the first, when we use lime\r\nand sulphur only, and then five gallons instead of six, in each tank of\r\nwater. We use angle nozzles, the better to direct the spray into the\r\ncalyxes.\r\n\r\nThe orchard was mowed twice during the summer, early in June and the\r\nmiddle of July. A heavy growth of clover covers most of the orchard, and\r\nnone is ever removed, all is left to decay just as it is left by the\r\nmowers.\r\n\r\nThe next thing in line to take our attention is thinning the fruit. The\r\npast season we thinned the Wealthy and top-worked varieties only;\r\nanother season, we expect to carry this work to every tree in the\r\norchard. The trees were gone over twice in the season, although the bulk\r\nof the work is done at the first operation. We use thinning shears made\r\nexpressly for the purpose.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July the trees in many instances were carrying maximum\r\nloads, and unless rendered assistance by propping in some way, the\r\nlimbs, great numbers of them, must soon break. To get props to prop\r\nhundreds of trees, needing from five to six up to a dozen per tree, and\r\napply them, looked like a big job. To purchase lumber for props the\r\nprice was prohibitive; to get them from the woods was impossible. We\r\nfinally solved the problem by purchasing bamboo fish poles, sixteen and\r\ntwenty feet long, and by using No. 12 wire, making one turn around the\r\npole at the required height, turning up the end of the wire to hold it\r\nand making a hook out of the other end of the wire, using about seven or\r\neight inches of wire for each. These made excellent props at small\r\nexpense, the ringlike excresences on the pole preventing the wire from\r\nslipping. We propped as many as four and five limbs at different heights\r\non one pole. This method carried the heavily loaded trees through the\r\nseason in good shape. Anyone afflicted with too many apples on their\r\ntrees should try it.\r\n\r\nNext in line came the harvesting of the crop. We use the \"Ideal\r\nBottomless Bag\" for a picking utensil, and almost all the fruit is\r\npicked from six foot step-ladders. We pack the apples in the orchard.\r\nFortunately we have had the same people pick our apples year after year,\r\nfrom the first crop until the last one of the past season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apples by the carload at Howard Lake.]\r\n\r\nIn packing we aim to use the kind of package the market demands. The\r\ncrop this season was all barreled. The pickers have been on the job long\r\nenough so that they are as able to discriminate as to what should go\r\ninto a barrel and what should not as I am myself. However, our system is\r\nto always have about twice as many barrels open ready for the apples as\r\nthere are pickers. The barrels are all faced one layer at least, and two\r\nlayers if we have the time, and as the pickers come in with\r\napproximately half a bushel of apples in the picking sack, they swing\r\nthe sack over the barrel, lower it, release the catch and the apples are\r\ndeposited without bruising in any way.\r\n\r\nThe next picker puts his in the next barrel, and so on, so that each\r\nsucceeding picker deposits his apples in the next succeeding barrel. In\r\nthat way I personally have the opportunity to inspect every half bushel\r\nof apples, or, I might say, every apple, as a half bushel of apples in a\r\nbarrel is shallow, making inspection a very simple matter. When the\r\nbarrels are filled they are headed up, put in the packing shed until\r\nsufficient have accumulated, and when that point is reached they are\r\nloaded out, billed to Minneapolis, where practically all our apples have\r\nbeen sold for years. All fruit up to date has been sold on a commission\r\nbasis, the crop for the past season aggregating five carloads, or\r\napproximately 800 barrels.\r\n\r\nWe feel that we have worked out a fairly good method to handle both our\r\ntrees and our apples, but we have not reached the conclusion that our\r\nmethods in any way guarantee us a crop of apples, although in ten years,\r\nor since the orchard came into bearing, we have never had a season that\r\nwe did not have a fair crop of apples. In 1913 we sold seven carloads,\r\nin 1914 four carloads, in 1915 five carloads, and the trees as far as\r\nthey are concerned promise us a fair crop for 1916. We are working as\r\nthough this is assured, but in the final analysis it is up to the\r\nweather man.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask Mr. Simmons in regard to his wiring. We\r\nare raising our trees in the same manner, the open-headed trees, and I\r\nwanted to ask him where the central ring is placed, in the crotch of the\r\ntree or where?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: The ring is suspended by the wires in the center of the\r\ntree. It makes an excellent arrangement. You can stand on that wire and\r\ngather the apples from the topmost limbs of the trees. The screw-eyes\r\nshould be put in at what might be termed the center of effort or pull,\r\nwhen the limb is heavily loaded. If not put in high enough, it causes a\r\nrather too acute angle where the screw-eye is inserted and the limb is\r\nlikely to break.\r\n\r\nA Member: We had considerable difficulty with broken branches.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Are the rings put on the outside or the inside of the trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: On the inside, so that the screw eyes all point towards the\r\ncenter of the tree. After three or four years you can't see the screw\r\neye, it grows right into the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I want to ask if you recommend the bamboo poles for general\r\npropping of trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: Yes, sir; most emphatically I would. It is the best and\r\nmost economical prop you can use. Of course, it is the general opinion\r\namong expert fruit growers that the crop should never be too heavy for\r\nthe tree. The bamboo prop is the best we found. With reasonable care,\r\nbamboo poles will outlast common lumber.\r\n\r\nIt is the general opinion among expert fruit growers that the tree\r\nshould carry all fruit possible, but should not be permitted to be\r\nloaded so heavy as to need propping.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I have an orchard of 70 acres and it would take a great many\r\nbamboo poles to prop that orchard. I use pieces of board, various\r\nlengths, 4 inches wide and 1 inch thick, of various lengths. I get them\r\n14 to 16 feet long and sometimes I cut them in two. My trees are large,\r\ntwenty-five and thirty and thirty-five years old, and that has been my\r\nmost successful material to prop with.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: What is the cost?\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: Well, you know what the lumber is, I paid about $24.00 a\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: When I tried to buy the props from the lumber yard they\r\nwould have cost me twenty cents each. I bought the twenty foot bamboo\r\npoles for $7.00 a hundred and the sixteen foot poles for $4.50 a\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nA Member: I didn't get where his orchard is located, and I would like to\r\nask about the variety of apples he had the best success with.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: The orchard is located at Howard Lake, forty-three miles\r\nwest of Minneapolis. We grow Duchess, Patten's Greenings, Hibernals and\r\nWealthys.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: What is your average cost per tree for thinning?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: We have for years thinned the Wealthy trees and our\r\ntop-worked varieties, but I never kept any accurate account of the cost\r\nof thinning.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: How old are your Wealthys?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: Fourteen years old.\r\n\r\nMr. Huestis: Mr. Simmons stated that he used the wire and the ring and\r\nthe screw-eyes. If he used that, why does he need props? I used the same\r\nthing this summer on some Wealthys and thinned them besides, and I\r\ndidn't need any props because I used the wire from the center ring to\r\nthe branches.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: Well, the wire supports support the main limbs but there\r\nare a great many laterals. For instance, you have the main limb going up\r\nhere at an angle of 90 degrees and the limbs that come out of that are\r\nnot supported. The props I use are supporting the laterals.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: Are your returns satisfactory shipping to the Minneapolis\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: Always have been very satisfactory; that has been my only\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFIGHTING MOTHS WITH PARASITES.--Over 12,000,000 specimens of\r\ntwo parasites which prey on the gipsy moth and brown-tail moth were\r\nreleased in 201 towns in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode\r\nIsland during the fall of 1914 and spring of 1915, according to the\r\nannual report of the Bureau of Entomology, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the successful establishment of colonies of these and\r\nother parasites which feed on the gipsy and brown-tail moths, marked\r\nprogress is being made in reducing these pests. Effective co-operation\r\nis being afforded by the States, which carry on as much work as possible\r\nwithin the infested areas, thus allowing the Federal authorities to\r\ncarry on field work along the outer border of infestation, so as to\r\nretard the gipsy moth's spread.--U.S. Dept. of Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Meeting. 1915, S.D. State Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nWM. PFAENDER, JR., NEW ULM, MINN., DELEGATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived at Huron, S.D., Monday night, January 17, 1916. The officers as\r\nwell as the members gave me a very fine reception and, although I am a\r\nlife member, I was made an honorary member of the society, and during my\r\nstay was entertained very agreeably.\r\n\r\nI attended all meetings. The society had three meetings each day, except\r\nThursday, the 20th, when there was no meeting held in the evening. On\r\naccount of the very cold weather the attendance from outside was not as\r\nlarge as it should have been.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting papers were read. Mr. E. D. Cowles, of Vermillion,\r\nin his paper on \"What to do when your grape vines freeze back,\"\r\nadvocated to break off the shoots (do not cut them off) near the old\r\nwood, so that new shoots would start from the same bud or eye and would\r\nproduce a crop.\r\n\r\nThe papers by the president, Rev. F. A. Hassold, \"Relation of\r\nHorticulture to Home-Making\" at the meeting, and \"Community Effort in\r\nRural Life\" at the banquet, were very fine and much appreciated by the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nProfessor N. E. Hansen in his paper, \"New Fruits,\" stated, among other\r\nthings, that he had made a large number of crosses with Chinese sand\r\npears and other pears, and that he expects to get from the crosses\r\nvarieties that will be blight proof, and that he intends to continue\r\nexperiments along this line.\r\n\r\nTwo very able and much appreciated papers at the banquet were:\r\n\"Landscape Gardening,\" by Miss Hazel J. Kent, and \"Transforming a Place\r\nInto a Home,\" by Mrs. Geo. H. Whiting, both of Yankton, S.D.\r\n\r\nGovernor Byrney was present at the banquet and in his address\r\ncongratulated the horticulturists of South Dakota on what they have\r\nattained and encouraged them in their difficult undertakings.\r\n\r\nYour delegate was asked to give notes on \"Minnesota Fruit Culture,\"\r\nwhich he did to the best of his ability. The discussions after each\r\npaper were interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was a very successful one and all present appreciated the\r\nfact that these gatherings assist in developing this great Northwest in\r\nhorticulture, forestry and many other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Sauk Rapids Trial Station.\r\n\r\nMRS. JENNIE STAGER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm weather this last spring came quite early, and with bated breath we\r\nwaited for the usual frost, but still it came not. The plum orchard\r\nbecame a wilderness of bloom; the buds of the apple trees began coyly to\r\nunfold their dainty loveliness; pussy willows flaunted their sweetness\r\non the air--while the birds sang their love notes from trees and bushes.\r\nThen frost came--not once, but night after night. Thus our hopes, which\r\nhad risen with every promise of a bountiful harvest, fell with the\r\nthermometer far below zero. When fall came both plum and apple orchards\r\nmade so poor a showing, not only here but all around this part of the\r\ncountry, that we had hardly enough fruit for our own uses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Stager's grandchildren among the roses of one year's\r\ngrowth.]\r\n\r\nWe had a great deal of rain, all through the spring and into the summer.\r\nStrawberries, that generally do well in wet weather, did not bless us\r\nwith their usual abundance. Currants and gooseberries also left us in\r\nthe lurch--but the Snyder blackberries were loaded with luscious fruit,\r\nwhile raspberries--why the berries of the Golden Queen bent the stalks\r\ndown with their weight. Prof. Hansen's Sunbeams were covered with\r\nberries, as were all of the seedling raspberries sent from the Breeding\r\nFarm three years ago, Nos. six and seven, of the red ones, bore the\r\nlargest and firmest berries. I had quite a time keeping the blossoms off\r\nthe everbearing strawberries sent here in the spring from the State\r\nBreeding Farm. Although I had bought and planted three named--and very\r\nmuch extolled--other kinds of everbearers, none of them were as prolific\r\nin plants, and extra large berries, as those unnamed ones from the State\r\nBreeding Farm. We had our first berries from them in August.\r\n\r\nWhen we had our fair here, the last of September, I made quite a showing\r\nof them, from the size of a bean (green) to a crab apple (ripe),\r\nsurrounded by leaves and blossoms. They were still covered with bloom\r\nwhen the hard frosts came.\r\n\r\nThe two small hybrid plums sent did not make much growth. Most\r\nvegetables that have always grown so well in other summers did very\r\npoorly this year. Out of four hundred and seventy-five tomato plants,\r\ntaken the best of care of by Inez, my granddaughter, for the state\r\ntomato contest, we did not get one bushel of good ripe ones. Lima and\r\nother table beans were planted three times (on account of rotting in the\r\nground) and then did not ripen. No ripe corn. In fact, about all the\r\nvegetables that came to fruition were peas, cauliflower and cabbage.\r\n\r\nOf flowers, sweet peas, pansies and early lilies were fine, although\r\ngrowing things were late. Paeonies had very few flowers. However, roses\r\nwere masses of bloom. Moss roses did the best ever, also large bushes of\r\nRosa Rugosa (you see this year, we had neither the ubiquitous potato\r\nbug, rose bug, caterpillar or any other varmint to war against); quite a\r\nnumber gave us blooms all summer. Then most of them threw out strong new\r\nplants, as do the raspberries, from the roots. On the whole, with our\r\nbounteous harvest of grain and so forth in this blessed country, we can\r\nbe thankful we are alive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKEEP YOUTH ON THE FARM.--\"What can we do to keep our young\r\npeople free from the deceiving lure of the city and contented to remain\r\non the farm?\".\r\n\r\nThe following was prepared by C. W. Kneale, of Niwot, Colo., a student in\r\ncivics in the Colorado School of Agriculture, as a part of his regular\r\nclass work. Young Kneale, although a student, has some excellent ideas\r\nwhich \"Father\" and \"Mother\" might do well to ponder carefully:\r\n\r\n\"Get good books, magazines and farm papers for them to read.\r\n\r\n\"Have some kind of lodges for them to go to, such as the Grange.\r\n\r\n\"Arrange it so they can have a party or entertainment once in a while.\r\n\r\n\"Go with them to church every Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Arrange it so they can have one or more picnics every year.\r\n\r\n\"Teach them how to do all kinds of farm work, by giving them a small\r\ntract of land to farm for themselves and showing them how to raise their\r\ncrops, and have them help you with your work.\r\n\r\n\"Give them a horse which they can ride or drive when they haven't\r\nanything to do, or when they want to go anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Teach them to love and be kind to animals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRavages of the Buffalo Tree Hopper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Latham recently sent me some twigs of apple tree very badly injured\r\nwith what we call the buffalo tree hopper. These scars are made entirely\r\nby the female in the act of egg-laying. This process of egg-laying takes\r\nplace from the last part of July until the leaves drop in the fall. The\r\neggs hatch the following spring. The young forms do not feed at all upon\r\nthe apple but get their nourishment by sucking the juices from the weeds\r\nand grasses in the immediate neighborhood of the orchard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Buffalo Tree Hopper and its work]\r\n\r\n\"The injury of this particular tree hopper is bad because the insect in\r\negg-laying makes two slits, side by side, afterwards poking the eggs\r\nbeneath the bark. As the tree continues to grow, the area between the\r\nslits dies, making a very rough appearance of the bark and an area into\r\nwhich spores of disease and bacteria may enter. The twig that is badly\r\nscarred very often dies, and sometimes young trees just set out are\r\nmarked so badly that they succumb.\r\n\r\n\"The only practical remedy against such a pest is clean cultivation of\r\nthe orchard, as one can readily work out from knowing the life history.\r\nIt is possible that some of the sprays like Bordeaux mixture, or\r\nself-boiled lime-sulphur, sprayed and kept active on the trees during\r\nthe month of August would deter these hoppers from laying eggs. However,\r\nwe have had no practical experience along this line, although we do know\r\nthat trees under clean cultivation are not affected.\"--A. G.

MICHAEL, WALKER, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSow seed in hotbed about April first, in rows five inches apart and five\r\ninches apart in each row. Transplant in garden one week after danger of\r\nfrost is past. The day before transplanting soak the hotbed thoroughly\r\nwith warm water. In taking them up to transplant use a sharp butcher\r\nknife; the ground thus cut out will form a cube five inches in diameter.\r\nThis block, should be set in a hole ten to twelve inches deep. The\r\nground around the block must be made very firm. This block will be four\r\nto six inches below the surface. _Fill the hole with warm rainwater_ and\r\nthree or four hours later rake in loose dirt to fill the hole, being\r\ncareful not to pack it in the least.\r\n\r\n_How to prepare the ground._ Manure heavily; plow very deep; harrow\r\nthoroughly. Then in forming the hills place two shovelfuls of fine\r\nmanure and one-half shovelful of hen manure for each hill. Spade this in\r\nfrom twelve to eighteen inches deep and eighteen to twenty inches wide.\r\nCultivate often.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be staked at first to keep the wind storms from\r\ninjuring them. When one and one-half feet high they should be trained\r\nover poles placed on each side of the row one and one-half feet from the\r\nground. Plant hills four feet apart, and _train each plant to four or\r\nfive vines_, cutting off all side shoots and a few of the leaves. _Never\r\ncut off_ the top of a vine to hasten the ripening.\r\n\r\nMake the ground _as rich as possible, plough deep, plant deep, set deep\r\nand prune carefully_. If you do not use poles or a trellis the vines\r\nthus managed should spread over the ground as pumpkin vines grow, and\r\ninstead of \"going all to vines\" the tendency will be to go all to\r\ntomatoes.\r\n\r\n_A big story._ Over $3,000 per acre. In 1910 I had three rows each forty\r\nfeet long and four feet apart, i.e., a row 120 feet long, or 480 square\r\nfeet. More than $35.00 worth of ripe tomatoes were taken from these\r\nvines, the price never more nor less than five cents per pound. If 480\r\nsquare feet will produce $35.00, 43,560 square feet would produce\r\n$3,175.\r\n\r\nDuring the tomato season I was away from home when a neighbor gathered\r\nbushels which are not counted in the above figures, and our family used\r\nand gave away several bushels more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Fourth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nJ. K. DIXON, NORTH ST. PAUL, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth district fruit crops--with the exception of strawberries and\r\nraspberries--were conspicuous by their absence this season of 1915.\r\n\r\nA festive blizzard that came prancing our way the 17th of May\r\neffectually destroyed what promised to be a bumper crop of apples and\r\nplums. The trees were for the most part past the blossoming stage, and\r\nthe fruit had started to develop. Currants and grapes met the same\r\ndisastrous fate. Only in favored situations, adjacent to large bodies of\r\nwater, were there any apples, plums, grapes or currants to speak of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. J. K. Dixon, North St. Paul.]\r\n\r\nIn my orchard, at North St. Paul, we burned wet straw smudges every\r\nsecond row on the outside of the orchard, allowing the wind to drift the\r\nsmoke through trees. This was done by adding the wet straw at intervals\r\nto the burning piles in order to create a continuous dense smoke. When\r\ndaylight appeared we noticed the ground covered with a beautiful blanket\r\nof frost, and decided two men smoking pipes would have been as effective\r\ntreatment as the smudge.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, I have since concluded we were mistaken. As the season\r\nadvanced we noticed the first three or four rows in from the smudges\r\ngave us our only apples, whereas the further one went in the fewer were\r\nfound, until they finally disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nQuestion: If the above treatment had been given every second or third\r\nrow throughout orchard, what would the results have been?\r\n\r\nStrawberries and raspberries proved their superior ability to withstand\r\nthe assaults of King Boreas and Jack Frost. Strawberries were in blossom\r\nand were saved from total loss by a two or three inch blanket of wet\r\nsnow that fortunately preceded the frost. Consequently they are reported\r\nas fair to good crop. Raspberries, owing to the abundant and regular\r\nrainfall, are reported from all over the district as a fair crop. One\r\ngrower having one-half acre of the St. Regis everbearing red raspberry\r\nreports having ripe berries from the last week in June to the 8th day of\r\nOctober, when a big freeze-up put them out of commission. This one-half\r\nacre produced 2,000 pints, that sold for fancy prices. Also the\r\neverbearing strawberries are reported as making good and proving their\r\nclaim to recognition as an established institution in the fruit world.\r\n\r\nA few of the largest growers report spraying with lime-sulphur and\r\narsenate of lead. However, the rainfall was too abundant at the right\r\ntime (or wrong time) to get best results.\r\n\r\nVery little blight is reported as present the past summer, and what\r\nlittle there was yielded readily to the pruning knife applied five or\r\nsix inches below infected wood, being careful to sterilize tool in\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate. The most serious injury from blight is\r\ncaused by its attacking tender sprout growths on trunks or large\r\nbranches. The blight runs very rapidly down the tender wood, penetrating\r\nto the cambium layer, where it causes cankers, often girdling entire\r\ntrunk and killing tree outright. This is especially true of the Virginia\r\ncrab and Wealthy apple.\r\n\r\nTrees and plants came through last winter in A1 condition as a\r\nconsequence of a mild winter, and this fall they go into winter quarters\r\nwith abundance of moisture and well ripened wood.\r\n\r\nConsiderable nursery stock was planted last spring with excellent\r\nresults, due to plentiful supply of moisture from spring to fall.\r\n\r\nWhile fruit growing in Minnesota is not so extensively engaged in as in\r\nsome reputed fruit growers' paradises we read about, I wish to state\r\nthat the South and East (to speak in the vernacular) \"has nothing on\r\nus.\" I have reliable information that the same freeze that cleaned us\r\nout up here in the North did the same trick for growers at Mobile,\r\nAlabama. Therefore, I advise members not to yield to discouragement.\r\nPlant and care for varieties recommended in the society planting list\r\nand emulate the society motto, \"Perseverantia Vincimus.\"\r\n\r\nFrom replies to letters sent out the following list of varieties\r\nappears to be in favor as the most desirable to plant in this district:\r\n\r\n     Apples: Wealthy, Okabena, Duchess, Patten's Greening.\r\n\r\n     Crabs: Florence, Whitney, Lyman's Prolific.\r\n\r\n     Plums: DeSoto, Hawkeye, Wyant, Wolf.\r\n\r\n     Raspberries: King, Sunbeam, Minnetonka Ironclad.\r\n\r\n     Currants: Perfection, Prince Albert, Long Bunch Holland,\r\n     Wilder.\r\n\r\n     Gooseberries: Carrie, Houghton, Downing.\r\n\r\n     Grapes: Beta, Concord, Delaware.\r\n\r\n     Hardy Shrubs: Spirea Van Houtii, Hydrangea P.G., Snowball,\r\n     Syringa, Tartarian Honeysuckle, Lilac, High-bush Cranberry,\r\n     Barberry, Sumac, Elderberry, Golden Leaf Elder, Buckthorn for\r\n     hedges.\r\n\r\n     Hardy Perennials--Flowers: Delphinium, Campanula, Phlox,\r\n     Paeonies, Iris, Hermerocallis, Tiger Lilies.\r\n\r\n     Tender Plants: Dahlias, Gladiolus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Mandan, N.D., Trial Station.\r\n\r\nW. A. PETERSON, SUPT., MANDAN, N.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1914 a number of plums, grapes and raspberries were\r\nreceived from the Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm. The larger part of the\r\nplums were winter killed in 1914-15. Those that survive after a few more\r\nwinters may be considered as practically hardy. Those remaining made a\r\ngood growth in 1915, but did not bear.\r\n\r\nThe grapes lived through the winter in good shape, although they had\r\nbeen covered. These are all Beta seedlings.\r\n\r\nThe raspberries Nos. 3, 7, and 8, were partly covered and partly left\r\nexposed--all three numbers died to the ground when not protected. No. 4\r\nwas received in the spring of 1915 and made a good growth.\r\n\r\nStrawberry No. 1017 was received in spring 1915 and bore heavily this\r\nfall but made only a very few runners.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments are being carried on in plant-breeding, pomology,\r\nvegetable gardening, arboriculture and ornamental horticulture, and in\r\nthe course of time a lot of valuable information will be gathered.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the season was backward in spring and the summer was\r\nabnormally cool. There was sufficient rainfall for all crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Growing a Successful Industry in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nA. W. RICHARDSON, FRUIT GROWER, HOWARD LAKE, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now about eighteen years since I conceived the idea of fruit\r\nculture as a competency for old age, being then, as now, employed as\r\nrepresentative for some concern and required to travel over this state,\r\nearning a livelihood for myself and family. The nature of my first work\r\non the road necessitated my attendance (a large portion of the time) at\r\nMinnesota farmers' institute meetings, where I came in contact with\r\nthose gentlemen employed in that work, and among the number our friend\r\nClarence Wedge, of Albert Lea, and other personal friends, such as O. C.\r\nGregg, the founder of the institute work, Mr. Greely, Mr. Trow and\r\nothers. It was among these gentlemen I got my first desire for a piece\r\nof land, and was advised by them several times to get a piece of land,\r\nand if I could not afford to buy a large piece, to buy a small piece,\r\nwhich latter course I was compelled to adopt. I became imbued with a\r\ndesire to grow fruit and was particularly interested in the subject of\r\nhorticulture, and eagerly devoured all the literature obtainable on the\r\nsubject, and listened very attentively to all discussions on the subject\r\nat these meetings.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 I moved to Howard Lake and succeeded Mr. E. J. Cutts in the\r\nnursery and fruit growing business. Mr. Cutts was well known to a great\r\nmany. He died just prior to my residence in Howard Lake, where I got in\r\nmy first practical experience in the fruit-growing business. After\r\nconducting this business for about twelve months, I disposed of it and\r\nbought a home in another part of town and at once set out about 200\r\napple trees and other small fruit. Gradually I acquired more land and\r\nset out more trees, until today I have about 1,600 apple trees, about\r\n1,000 of which are at bearing age. I made one grand mistake however, as\r\na great many other growers have done and are still doing, I planted too\r\nmany varieties. I used the list of tried and recommended sorts issued by\r\nthe State Horticultural Society (long before I became a member) and\r\nplanted accordingly and, like many other growers, have my quota of\r\nHibernals, Minnesotas, Marthas and other sorts which experience has\r\ndemonstrated are not nearly as desirable as other varieties.\r\n\r\nI have demonstrated to my entire satisfaction that it is profitable and\r\nperfectly proper to grow also small fruits in a young orchard. In my\r\nsecond orchard, containing about 600 trees, I planted the trees 15x30\r\nfeet and later the same season set out raspberries 3x6 feet, occupying\r\nall the space in the rows and between the rows, and for two successive\r\nseasons I grew a third crop between the raspberries, which plan works\r\nadmirably. One mistake I made, however, was in planting a little too\r\nclose to the apple trees, requiring more hoeing around the apple trees\r\nto keep the raspberries in subjection, which could have been obviated to\r\na large extent by not planting so closely. I grew raspberries about\r\nseven years in this orchard. My returns after the second year brought me\r\n$500.00 to $700.00 annually, and I sold enough plants to more than pay\r\nme for all the labor expended on the orchard, to say nothing of corn,\r\nbeans, cabbage, etc., raised the first two years between the\r\nraspberries. Now the trees are about ten years old and all bearing. I\r\nhave discontinued the cultivation and have seeded to clover, which we\r\nusually mow and allow to lie and rot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of A. W. Richardson, at Howard Lake.]\r\n\r\nI figure that outside the investment I have brought my orchard into\r\nbearing with practically no expense, having had a revenue every year\r\nsince planting the trees, which are composed of Patten Greening,\r\nHibernal, Duchess, Wealthy, Peerless, Minnesota, Virginia, Okabena and\r\nWhitney. My last orchard of 625 trees consists principally of Wealthy,\r\nand trees are set 20x20, and I am following the same plan of growing a\r\ncrop between. The year 1915 makes four crops taken from this young\r\norchard, now four years old. About two more seasons will follow this\r\nyear, and then about the time for bearing I will discontinue the\r\nplanting of any crop and sow it to clover.\r\n\r\nI plant one or two year old trees trimmed to a whip, digging a much\r\nlarger and deeper hole than is really necessary to accommodate the\r\nroots, but I am sure this plan gives the roots a much better start than\r\nif they are crowded into a small hole, and particularly if the ground is\r\nhardpan or similar soil. Pinching off the buds the following year or\r\ntwo, when you commence shaping your trees to your liking, is good, thus\r\neliminating severe pruning. I have endeavored to follow up this annual\r\npruning when possible, often being compelled to hire additional help for\r\nthis purpose, as the nature of my regular business keeps me from home\r\nwhen I should be pruning. I am sure you will agree with me so far that\r\n\"fruit growing in Minnesota is successful.\"\r\n\r\nFour years ago or more I decided that in order to receive the top price\r\nfor the products off my place I must produce a first class article, and\r\nso to that end I have worked. I bought a gasoline power sprayer, costing\r\nme about $300--by the way, the first one in Howard Lake, although two of\r\nus there each bought one the same spring, and now there are three power\r\nsprayers in our village. I have demonstrated that it is possible to get\r\nthe top price of the market in more ways than one by furnishing a first\r\nclass article. You will ask me how it is possible for me to do this and\r\nbe away from home so much. I have been ably assisted by my wife, who\r\nsees that my general directions are carried out as I have outlined.\r\n\r\nThis year we have marketed something over 300 barrels and have received\r\nthe top market price, netting me about $500.00. I tried out a new plan\r\nthis year, selling through a reliable commission firm. I have heretofore\r\nsold direct to the retailer with splendid results. 1913 was a bumper\r\nyear and the market flooded everywhere with poor unsprayed stuff. I sold\r\nabout 250 barrels and received an average of $3.25 per barrel, F.O.B.\r\nHoward Lake, and in 1914 about the same amount was realized. There is\r\nalways a good demand for a good article, carefully picked and honestly\r\npacked, discarding all bruised and scabby or wormy apples, or those\r\nundersized or less than 2-1/2 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis season I sprayed my trees three times, the first time early in\r\nApril, using what is known as a dormant spray, using commercial\r\nlime-sulphur solution 32 degrees Baume, 20 gallons to a tank of 200\r\ngallons of water, or four times as strong as the two subsequent\r\nsprayings, after the blossoms fall, at which later time I use in\r\naddition arsenate of lead, 10 pounds to a 200 gallon tank of water, and\r\nwork under 200 pound pressure--and by doing thorough work can produce\r\napples almost entirely free from any disease or worms. My last shipment\r\nof apples this year was October 2nd and consisted of 196 barrels,\r\none-third each of Hibernals, Patten Greenings and Wealthys, which\r\nbrought top prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. A. W. Richardson, Howard Lake.]\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer in co-operative marketing and think it is the only\r\nlogical way to market any crop, but to conduct a successful marketing\r\norganization there should be stringent rules compelling all who join an\r\nassociation for marketing to spray thoroughly if nothing else, as I am\r\nfirmly convinced that you cannot grow apples and compete with other\r\nlocalities without doing so, and doing so every year, whether a prospect\r\nfor a good crop exists or not. I can prove this, as I only partly\r\ncovered my entire orchard in 1913 with spraying. You could easily see\r\nwhich had been sprayed and which not. Excessive rain at the vital time\r\nprevented my completion of the work. I am convinced by experience, too,\r\nthat the dormant spray, usually neglected by most growers, is very\r\nnecessary and am sure better and healthier foliage is obtained by this\r\npractice, and by it the scale can be controlled in a large degree.\r\n\r\nI had eight to ten Patten's Greening trees that had been attacked by a\r\ndisease called by some \"oyster scale.\" The trees abnormally lost their\r\nfoliage early in the season, and I had about decided they were dead\r\nwhen, after a dormant spray the following spring, they entirely revived\r\nand are now as healthy as any trees on my place.\r\n\r\nI have practiced top-working to some extent and for the past three or\r\nfour years have been able to put down in my cellar, several bushels of\r\nJonathan, Grimes Golden, Delicious and other varieties. Have now about\r\n125 Jonathan trees top-worked on Hibernals, and except for some blight\r\nthey have done splendidly.\r\n\r\nThere is no room for discussion, no room for argument in any way, why\r\nfruit-growing in Minnesota is not a very successful business to be\r\nengaged in. I have demonstrated, I am sure, that if I can bring an\r\norchard into bearing and hold down a good, fairly lucrative position at\r\nthe same time and do so with very little expense, and others can do the\r\nsome thing.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to criticise some one and let the criticism fall where it\r\nbelongs. There has been a great injustice done the commercial fruit\r\ngrower, or those trying to grow fruit commercially, by advising, urging,\r\nor anything else you choose to call it, the farmer or small homekeeper\r\nto buy more fruit trees and plants than this class of individual needs\r\nfor his own use. In order to receive some returns for this surplus, he\r\nrushes it into town and sells it to the best advantage, delivered in\r\nsacks, soap boxes, etc., carelessly handled and bumped into town in a\r\nlumber wagon. The merchant is loaded up with a lot of unsalable stuff\r\nand often finds himself overloaded and barrels up some and sends it to\r\nthe commission row and expects some returns, which vary from nothing to\r\na very small amount. Why, last season I knew a large general merchandise\r\nconcern in a town a little west of Howard Lake that thought they had\r\nstruck a gold mine. They employed a packer or two, bought barrels,\r\nrented a building and bought this class of stuff right and left, offered\r\nat any old price, $1.50 per barrel to anything they could get, and sold\r\nclear up to the Canadian line. I saw the stuff a great many times after\r\nit reached its destination, and it was hardly fit for sale at any price.\r\nThis indiscriminate selling of nursery stock by eager salesmen and\r\nnurserymen is doing more to hurt the commercial fruit growing industry\r\nthan any one thing. The only salvation for the grower making his living\r\nout of the business is to produce a better article, better picked,\r\nbetter packed and marketed through the proper channels. This matter just\r\nreferred to I have often discussed by the hour, and during the past\r\nwinter my views were thoroughly endorsed by prominent men in the\r\nextension work of our state.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion will say, comparing the fruit industry in Minnesota with\r\nthat greatest of all industry, raising grain, it is so much easier (if\r\nordinary care be exercised) to produce a finer article, more attractive\r\nin appearance, better packed and marketed properly, than the other\r\nfellow does, while in growing grain this is not the case, as all the\r\ngrain is dumped into the hopper and bin, and the individuality of the\r\ngrower is forever lost. The demand for the apple has increased\r\nwonderfully the last few years, and it is quite likely to be further\r\nincreased owing to the European demand for American apples, which for\r\nthe next fifteen or twenty years will increase by leaps and bounds,\r\nowing to the devastating of so many of the great orchard sections in\r\nparts of Austria and northern France. This authentic information came\r\nthrough Mr. H. W. Collingwood, many years editor of the Rural New Yorker,\r\nand according to Mr. Collingwood's idea there has been no time in the\r\nhistory of the United States when the outlook for commercial orchards\r\nwas so bright. He advises the widespread planting of commercial orchards\r\nto meet this new demand which has shown itself already in Europe and\r\nwill greatly increase after the war is over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A two-acre field of Dunlap strawberries on place of A. W.\r\nRichardson, at Howard Lake.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I would like to know what you advise for that commercial\r\norchard, what varieties?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Wealthys, all the time. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I would like to ask for the comparative prices you received\r\nfor the three apples you mentioned, Wealthy, Greening and Hibernal.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: The Hibernal sold for around $3.00 a barrel and the\r\nWealthy sold for three something. Mind you, I never sold apples at all\r\nuntil this year to Minneapolis markets. I can sell all the apples I can\r\ngrow myself without any trouble if I have the proper men to pick them\r\nand pack them at home. I had a son that was doing that until a few years\r\nago, and he followed my instructions and would place nothing but first\r\nclass stuff in the barrels and would sell my samples without any trouble\r\nand get the top market price. I run across down in my cellar some of\r\nlast year's crop of Northwest Greenings, just two of them left, one of\r\nthem partially decayed. Something I never had known to happen before.\r\nThey lay in the cellar just wrapped up.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: It wasn't embalmed?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: No, sir. Gentlemen, you need not be afraid of growing\r\nfruit in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: What peculiar method have you for keeping those apples?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Just wrapped in paper only.\r\n\r\nThe President: What temperature do you keep in your cellar?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: 40 degrees about this time.\r\n\r\nThe President: You have a heater in your cellar?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Yes, sir, but this is shut off from that, though the\r\npipes run through.\r\n\r\nA Member: Are your trees still as far apart as they were at first?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: No, sir. I neglected to say that I sent East and got\r\nsome roots, and I was advised to set them out between. I have part of my\r\norchard set 15x16, but that is too close together.\r\n\r\nA Member: If you were going to do it again would you put them 30x30?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: 20x20, that is, Wealthys, particularly. Of course, for\r\nthe Hibernals, you got to put them farther apart.\r\n\r\nA Member: You mentioned the Delicious. What is your opinion of the\r\nDelicious?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: My experience has been so little with them. I have about\r\n150 Jonathan trees coming on that will be all right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARBLE PILLAR TO FAMOUS MCINTOSH TREE.--Perhaps one of the most\r\ncurious monuments in existence has recently been built in Ontario by\r\nCanadians. The farmers have just erected a marble pillar to mark the\r\nsite on which grew a famous apple tree.\r\n\r\nMore than a century ago a settler in Canada named McIntosh, when\r\nclearing a space in which to make a home in the wilderness, discovered\r\namong a number of wild apple trees one which bore fruit so well that he\r\ncultivated it and named it McIntosh Red.\r\n\r\nThe apple became famous, and seeds and cuttings were distributed to all\r\nparts of Canada, so that now the McIntosh Red flourishes wherever apples\r\ngrow in the great dominion. In 1896 the original tree from which this\r\nenormous family sprang was injured by fire, but it continued to bear\r\nfruit until five years ago. Then, after 15 years, it died, and the\r\ngrateful farmers have raised a marble pillar in honor of the tree which\r\nhas done so much for the fruit growing industry of their land.\r\n\r\nThe story of this apple tree illustrates the African proverb that though\r\nyou can count the apples on one tree, you can never count the trees in\r\none apple.--January Popular Science Monthly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of Committee on Horticultural Building.\r\n\r\nS. P. CROSBY, CHAIRMAN, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you know, at the last legislature there was a bill prepared and\r\nintroduced asking for an appropriation of $40,000 to build a new home\r\nfor this society. It was provided, that that home should be located on\r\nthe grounds of University Farm or upon the grounds of the State\r\nAgricultural Society, and that was to be left to the discretion of the\r\nexecutive board of this society. The bill is a very well drawn bill, and\r\nthe committee appeared before the legislature some four or five times.\r\nWe went before the committee of the senate and before the committee of\r\nthe house and senate, and as a matter of fact the result was that the\r\nbill never came out of the committee.\r\n\r\nThe cry last year, as it is every year, was that of retrenchment and low\r\ntaxes. Now, that is all right as a general proposition, but Minnesota is\r\nnot a poor state. In the cities of course we think we have all the taxes\r\nwe ought to have, and we think they are pretty high; perhaps you\r\ngentlemen living in the country think you have as high taxes as you\r\nought to have, but that the state, for instance, has over $30,000,000 in\r\nthe school fund, probably reaching up to fifty or sixty millions some\r\nday, with other figures which can be given here, shows that Minnesota is\r\nnot a poor state. On the other hand, it shows that Minnesota is a rich\r\nstate. Certainly there is no good reason why it should not provide a\r\ngood home for this society, which has earned it and is nearly fifty\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to say one thing. Don't depend\r\nupon the committee to do all this work. While we didn't get our bill\r\nthrough last year we came away full of courage, and just as sure as\r\nnight follows the day we are going to have a new home for this society\r\none of these days. (Applause.) But I want it distinctly understood that\r\nevery member of this society, men and women--and I certainly include the\r\nwomen because oftentimes they are the best politicians, and they know\r\nhow to talk to people and get things--when the next legislature is\r\nelected must use his or her influence with the senators and\r\nrepresentatives of the various districts of the state and make an\r\nimpression upon them and get a promise out of them to vote for and\r\nsupport the bill. A bill will be introduced into the next legislature,\r\nand it will probably be this same bill, and if you don't forget this,\r\nbut simply do your duty in seeing these representatives and taking the\r\nmatter up, why there isn't very much doubt in my judgment but what we\r\nwill be successful and have our bill passed.\r\n\r\nWe have members, I think, in every county of the state, haven't we,\r\nPresident Cashman?\r\n\r\nThe President: Yes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. S. P. Crosby, St. Paul.]\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: If we only have two or three in some counties, if they would\r\nmake an effort to see every representative and senator and talk the\r\nmatter over, that is what is going to count. It is a year or something\r\nlike that before the legislature meets again, but it don't want to be\r\nforgotten, and if every live member of this society will put his\r\nshoulder to the wheel, I don't think there is any possible doubt but\r\nwhat we will succeed and have the bill pass.\r\n\r\nWe broke the ice last winter and got acquainted with some of the people.\r\nAnd another thing I want to say, and that is if that bill the next time\r\nis not reported favorably out of the committee I would be in favor for\r\none of having it reported to the house or senate without any\r\nrecommendation of the committee. I talked with probably fifteen or\r\ntwenty, I should say, of the different members of the senate and house\r\nabout that bill, and it had a great many friends both in the house and\r\nsenate. Some of them came to me and said: \"Crosby, why don't you put it\r\nin the house, and we will show you how we will vote.\" There was a whole\r\nlot of feeling that way, because if men investigate and find out what\r\nthe society is standing for and what it has done they will know it is a\r\nperfectly meritorious bill. I think with a reasonable amount of work we\r\nwill accomplish a great deal, and we shall succeed eventually in having\r\nthe bill passed.\r\n\r\nAnother matter that is proper to speak of now is to see where the\r\nmembers of this organization stand. I am going to tell you something. I\r\ndidn't hear it personally myself, but I did hear it from Mr. Yanish. He\r\nis a man of veracity and he told me. He said in the last legislature the\r\nHennepin delegation used all the strength they could against this bill.\r\nIf it is a rivalry between the two cities, St. Paul and Minneapolis when\r\nwe propose to put the building in neither Minneapolis or St. Paul, but\r\npractically midway between the two cities, if that rivalry can go to\r\nthat extent, it seems to me mighty small business.\r\n\r\nWe were very careful not to conflict in any way with the state\r\nuniversity in getting any of those appropriations they were asking for.\r\nThey wanted big sums of money. We didn't conflict with them, we didn't\r\ndo anything against them. We made a gentlemanly campaign and put our\r\ncase before the committee. There were a number of members who were\r\nfavorable, but of course there were thousands of bills in there, and it\r\ndidn't get out of the committees, as I said.\r\n\r\nWe see more and more every year what great necessities there are for a\r\nhome for this organization. We ought to have a building like as the\r\nplans given in Mr. Latham's last report, a building that would have a\r\nfine auditorium, a fine exhibit room, a place where we are at home\r\ninstead of going from place to place and meeting at different places and\r\nnot having the adequate facilities we ought to have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTORE VEGETABLES FOR THE WINTER.--The basement is often the\r\nbest place on the farm for storing vegetables, says R. S. Gardner, of the\r\nUniversity of Missouri, College of Agriculture. It must be properly\r\nbuilt, and the temperature, moisture, and ventilation conditions kept\r\nright if the best results are to be obtained. If it is too warm the\r\nvegetables will dry and shrivel, and if the ventilation is poor, drops\r\nof water will form and the vegetables will be more likely to decay. If\r\nthere is a furnace in the cellar, the storage room should be far enough\r\naway so that it can be kept cool, and during very cold weather the door\r\nmay be opened to prevent freezing.--Mo.

To\r\nraise good tomatoes does not depend so much on the variety you have as\r\nit does on the seed.\r\n\r\nIn the fall select your best tomatoes and save the seed. Then about the\r\nfirst of April sow your seed.\r\n\r\nYou can sow them in a box behind the stove, and as soon as they are up\r\ngive them all the sunlight you can. When they are about two inches high,\r\nhave some four-inch flower pots and transplant, giving them a good\r\nthorough wetting before removing them from the seed box to the flower\r\npots.\r\n\r\nBy this time it will be warm enough to have a cold frame, which may be\r\nprepared by nailing four boards together any size desired. One three by\r\nsix feet will hold about 150 plants. Shelter it well from the north and\r\nslope it a little to the south with enough dirt in the frame to hold\r\nyour pots.\r\n\r\nYou can cover them with storm windows or cloth tacked onto frames. Keep\r\nwell covered nights and give all the sunlight possible through the day.\r\nAfter danger of frost is past, set them out. Sandy loam is best, which\r\nmust be well pulverized and fertilized.\r\n\r\nAfter you have removed the plant from the pot and set it in the ground,\r\nplace the pot about two inches from the plant, also about two inches\r\ndeep in the ground. Then throw a small handful of dirt in each pot and\r\nfill with water as often as necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is the best way of watering that I know.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What kind do you think is the best for an early variety?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: Well, the Earliana is extensively raised and the Dwarf\r\nChampion.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What do you think of the Red Pear?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: I don't know anything about that, but for a late variety of\r\ntomato the Ponderosa is quite a tomato; it is a very large tomato.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: How about the Globe?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: That is a good tomato.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What do you know of the paper cartons instead of flower\r\npots?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: I have never tried the cartons; I should think they would\r\nbe all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: In saving your seed from year to year, is there any danger\r\nof the seed running out in time?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: I don't think so. If you take your best tomatoes I think\r\nyou will improve them.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: I should think the germination of that seed would run out?\r\n\r\nMr. Purdham: That may be, I can't say as to that. There are people that\r\nmake a specialty of studying that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, First Congressional District.\r\n\r\nF. I. HARRIS, LA CRESCENT, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making a report for the First Congressional District, I will say at\r\nthe beginning, that all my observations and interviews were taken in\r\nHouston and Winona counties, an especially favored locality this year,\r\nand I am well aware that the conditions and results are exceptional and\r\ndo not form a just estimate for the district and are certainly very much\r\nabove the average. The apple crop in the section named was a record\r\nbreaker, and where trees were at all cared for and properly sprayed the\r\nquality and size of the fruit was very superior and remarkably free from\r\ninsect pests and disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge on Lakeside Drive, at Albert Lea, in First\r\nCongressional District.]\r\n\r\nThe yield of several orchards in this vicinity was from 1,000 to 15,000\r\nbarrels of marketable fruit, an increase of nearly 100 per cent above\r\nthe largest previous crop. From this station twenty-one carload lots of\r\napples, averaging 200 barrels per car, were shipped, besides nearly as\r\nmany more sold in the local markets of La Crosse and Winona and shipped\r\nin small lots by freight and express. The prices obtained were in all\r\ncases good, considering that the varieties grown are mostly summer and\r\nfall and had to be sold in competition with Iowa and Illinois fruit.\r\nWhile all markets were over-supplied, the demand for the quality of\r\nfruit grown here in the commercial orchards was greatly in excess of\r\nthe supply and attracted buyers from Chicago and the Twin Cities and has\r\nbuilt a permanent market so long as the quality keeps up to this year's\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I am more than ever impressed with the necessity for\r\nsome manner of utilizing the surplus and low grade fruit with which the\r\nlocal markets are flooded. It seems a great waste to have thousands of\r\nbushels of apples fed to hogs and left to rot on the ground which would\r\nbe a large asset if converted into vinegar or canned. More than one-half\r\nthe fruit brought from farms is only fit for such use and by being\r\nforced on the market serves to lower prices and demand for good fruit. I\r\nvisited one farm orchard within twenty miles of here and saw at a low\r\nestimate 400 bushels of apples lying on the ground, all of which could\r\nhave been utilized in a factory, but not having been sprayed were not\r\nfit for barreling, and the owner had turned the hogs in to get rid of\r\nthem. This is a condition that is sure to become worse in view of the\r\nmany small orchards recently set, besides the commercial orchards that\r\nare just coming into bearing. From the reports received, in reply to\r\ncirculars sent out, I gather that the crop varied from nothing to 100\r\nper cent and the quality in corresponding ratio, depending in most cases\r\nupon whether orchards were properly sprayed or neglected.\r\n\r\nScab and other diseases caused a large proportion of the fruit set to\r\ndrop, and the remainder was unsalable in unsprayed orchards.\r\nConsiderable blight is reported in a number of orchards, especially\r\nwhere cultivated. Trees growing in sod were noticeably free from it.\r\nPractically nothing is being done to prevent its spreading. While\r\ncutting out the affected wood may in some cases check it, I am satisfied\r\na better remedy will have to be found before it is wiped out. In my own\r\norchard just a few trees located on low land and under cultivation were\r\naffected, and not a single case in sod.\r\n\r\nThere is from all reports an abundance of moisture in the ground, and\r\ntrees are in good condition to stand a hard winter, except that in some\r\ncases the buds started during the warm days of November.\r\n\r\nThe crop of strawberries was generally a very light one on account of\r\nblossoms being injured by late frosts and winter killing, but a few\r\ncorrespondents report a full crop.\r\n\r\nOther small fruits, including currants, raspberries and blackberries,\r\nwere a practical failure and light crop.\r\n\r\nThe crop of grapes was very light and in only a few favored localities\r\nripened before killing frosts. Plums, except in a few instances, were a\r\nfailure, the exceptions being in case of the Hansen hybrids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of S.H. Drum, Owatonna, in First Congressional\r\nDistrict--a veteran member of the society]\r\n\r\nWhile more varieties of apples are successfully grown in this vicinity\r\nthan elsewhere in the state, and some correspondents recommend a long\r\nlist, my experience and advice is to set only a few varieties of known\r\ncommercial value, and while far too many early apples are being grown,\r\nthis condition is better than planting winter apples of unknown\r\nhardiness and quality. The Northwestern Greening is the most profitable\r\nwinter apple here, but I understand it is not hardy in some localities\r\nin the state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALASKAN BERRY HYBRIDS.--At the Sitka Experiment Station in\r\nAlaska a strain of hardy strawberries is in the making, the result of\r\ncrosses between the native of the Alaskan coast region and cultivated\r\nvarieties. Several thousand seedlings have been grown, all very vigorous\r\nand most of them productive and of high quality. The native variety of\r\nthe interior of Alaska is now to be used in similar crosses.\r\n\r\nThe Cuthbert raspberry has been crossed with its relatives, the native\r\nSalmonberry (_Rubus spectabilis_ Pursh.) and the Thimbleberry (_R.\r\nparviflorus_ Nutt.). The only interesting fact so far developed is that\r\nthe hybrids of the two species first named are almost entirely sterile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Seventh Congressional District.\r\n\r\nP. H. PETERSON, ATWATER, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the answers received on blanks sent out I find there was a fair\r\ncrop of apples raised throughout this district, with the trees in good\r\ncondition for winter. Wood is well ripened up, leaves all shed and\r\nplenty of moisture in the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A productive strawberry field at P. H. Peterson's Atwater\r\nfruit farm.]\r\n\r\nAll report none or very little blight this year. Spraying is not done\r\ngenerally, but those few who do it are getting results. In our own\r\norchard, which was sprayed twice last spring, we have not found one\r\nwormy apple.\r\n\r\nPlums, none or a very few. Mr. Bjornberg, of Willmar, reports the\r\nSurprise plum a full crop, others a total failure. Compass cherry bore a\r\nfair crop, but with me it rotted badly, as also did Prof. Hansen's\r\nplums, Sapa and Opata.\r\n\r\nGrapes: Not many are grown except the Beta, which bore a heavy crop in\r\nspite of the late spring frosts.\r\n\r\nBlackberries: Nothing doing.\r\n\r\nRaspberries and strawberries were a light crop. Strawberries especially\r\nwere badly damaged by late spring frosts--with me they were nearly a\r\ntotal failure except the everbearing, which gave us a good crop. And I\r\nwant to add that they are here to stay for home use, and possibly as a\r\nmarket berry. Plants are fully as hardy as the June-bearing sorts. No\r\nmatter how many times the blossoms are frozen off in the spring they\r\nwill come right out again and give us berries until it freezes up in\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nCurrants and gooseberries were a fair crop.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports I gather that less nursery stock has been planted here\r\nthan usual, but with good results, as the season has been favorable for\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\nThe fruit list recommended by the State Horticultural Society can be\r\nrelied on in this locality.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of interest shown here in top-working the better\r\nquality winter apples onto hardy trees with good results, and the\r\nHibernal seems to be the best stock to use--it certainly ought not to be\r\nplanted for any other purpose. The apple is a drug on the market, and\r\nthose who planted largely of this variety find it difficult to dispose\r\nof the crop at any price.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTUDYING FRUITS IN ILLINOIS.--Many seedling apples are being\r\ngrown at the Illinois Experiment Station. Reciprocal hybridizations\r\nbetween standard orchard varieties and various species of the genus\r\nMalus have been made, fifty-seven species and varieties which are not of\r\ncommercial importance having been obtained from the Arnold Arboretum at\r\nBoston. Direct improvement through these violent crosses is not\r\nanticipated, but it is hoped to acquire valuable information regarding\r\nthe affinities of the various species used, and also to produce material\r\nfor use in back crossing. Reciprocal crosses between standard orchard\r\nvarieties are also being made in large numbers, while a difficult piece\r\nof work has been attempted in the reciprocal crossing of different\r\nstrains of the same variety, and different individuals of the same\r\nstrain. C.S. Crandall writes: \"This project has aimed at the selfing of\r\nparticular individuals, and the use on trees here of pollen from trees\r\nof the same variety in orchards 100 miles away and grown under quite\r\ndifferent conditions. Considerable effort has been expended in the\r\nprosecution of this project, but up to the present time we have recorded\r\nno successful pollinations. We have not as yet a very wide range of\r\nvarieties, but as far as we have gone we have encountered complete\r\nsterility in the selfing within the individuals and in the attempt to\r\nuse pollen of the same variety brought from a distance. The unfortunate\r\nfeature about all the hybridizing work with apples is the mongrel\r\ncharacter of the plants on which we work. We know nothing of the\r\nparentage of any of our varieties, and it seems quite useless to\r\nspeculate on what the segregation of characters may be in crosses\r\nbetween different varieties. A further discouraging feature in apple\r\nbreeding is the long period required to get results from any particular\r\ncross. Effort is being made to shorten this period by grafting scions of\r\nhybrid seedlings on dwarf stocks and growing the plants in pots. This\r\nwill help some, but at best the attainment of results is some distance\r\nin the future. We are endeavoring to maintain a reasonably complete\r\nrecord of every step that is taken so that a complete history may be\r\navailable for those who may later continue the work.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuing the projects as outlined above there are a number of minor\r\nproblems that are receiving some attention: such as the retention of the\r\nvitality of pollen, the period of receptivity, the seed production in\r\nhybrid fruits, and the time for and percentage of the germination of\r\nseeds. On all of these points we are accumulating considerable\r\ninformation that it is hoped may be of some practical value.\"--Journal\r\nof Heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpraying the Orchard.\r\n\r\nHON. H. M. DUNLAP, SAVOY, ILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I am out of place with this topic of mine or not\r\nwith a Minnesota audience, but I came through the exhibit rooms as I\r\ncame up to the hall, and whether you spray or not you certainly need to,\r\nfor I saw all sorts of fungous diseases upon your fruit. I presume that\r\nthese are not the poorest specimens you have--very few people, you know,\r\nbring the poorest specimens they have to an exhibition place, Mr.\r\nPresident, and I presume that if these are the best you have the poorest\r\nmust be pretty bad in the way of fungous diseases.\r\n\r\nOf course, people don't like to have their faults told them, but if we\r\nhave anything the matter with us it is best for us to find out what the\r\nmatter is and then get rid of it. It is better than to do as many did in\r\nthe commercial fruit-growing states a number of years ago about the San\r\nJose scale, those that were interested in having that fact suppressed,\r\nor at least thought they were interested in having the fact suppressed\r\nthat they had San Jose scale within the confines of their state. They\r\ndidn't want that information to get out, so they didn't discuss the\r\nmatter of San Jose scale in their societies.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois we took a different view of that proposition, and it was,\r\nthat we had the San Jose scale and we thought the thing to do was to\r\nstamp it out, to get after it. So we agitated that subject in our\r\nsociety and talked about it. We had the state entomologist canvass the\r\nentire state to find out where the San Jose scale was doing its work and\r\ngave him authority to go in and spray those places or cut down the trees\r\nand get them out of the way. The effect of that work is very evident.\r\n\r\nThe people of other states would point to us saying that they did not\r\nhave the scale but that we had because we reported the fact, but I know\r\nthey now have it a great deal worse than we do because of this neglect.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of spraying and spraying materials, if we go back in\r\nhistory--we have to look for truth wherever we find it, whether it comes\r\nfrom low or high sources. As a matter of fact thieves and sheep ticks\r\nand ignorance are largely responsible for our spraying and the spraying\r\nmaterials of today. It doesn't sound very well in a scientific body to\r\ntalk that way, but truth is truth wherever you find it, whether it comes\r\nfrom the university professor or from the farmer. If we recognize truth,\r\nfrom whatever source it comes, then we are open-minded and can take\r\nadvantage of things that will be greatly to our benefit.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of spraying materials: They were discovered through\r\naccident, in an effort to prevent thieving in the vineyards of Bordeaux,\r\nFrance. It seems that workmen on the way to their places of employment\r\nwere in the habit of foraging on the vineyards of the farmers along the\r\nway. To prevent that some of the fruit growers conceived the idea it\r\nwould be a good thing in order to scare them to get blue vitriol and mix\r\nit with water and spray it on the fruit along the roadside. Later in the\r\nseason, very much to their surprise, they found that the grapes that\r\nwere treated in that way were not affected with the brown rot. So they\r\ntried it again to see whether they were right about that being the\r\ncause, and it wasn't long before they used it for that purpose. They\r\nstopped the thieving, but they also discovered a scientific truth, that\r\nthe Bordeaux mixture was a fungicide and that fact has been of immense\r\nvalue to the world since then.\r\n\r\nWhen the San Jose scale came into this country from the west, some man\r\nwho had used sheep dip for sheep ticks, said: \"If it is a good thing\r\nagainst sheep ticks, why isn't it good against this little vermin they\r\ncall the San Jose scale?\" He tried it on the trees, and he found that it\r\nwas an effective remedy for the San Jose scale. So we have lime-sulphur\r\ntoday as one of the spray materials in very common use.\r\n\r\nAmong other things the scientists told us we couldn't use lime-sulphur\r\nand arsenate of lead together, that they would have to be sprayed over\r\nthe orchard in separate sprays, that is, we would have to go over the\r\norchard with lime-sulphur and then again with arsenate of lead, that\r\nwhen you combined the two the chemical combination was such that it\r\ndeteriorated the lime-sulphur. Some farmer who didn't know about that\r\nscientific proposition determined to put them both on together, and he\r\nfound that it not only worked all right but that the two were really\r\nmore effective when combined than if put on separately. So you see it\r\nwas thieves, sheep ticks and ignorance that are responsible for three of\r\nour most successful ways of spraying at the present time.\r\n\r\nNow, scientific men have come in and given us a great deal of\r\ninformation along various lines in regard to spraying, and I don't decry\r\nscience in any sense at all. These men, while they were not\r\nscientifically educated, discovered scientific truths, and it is truths\r\nwe want after all.\r\n\r\nJust what your position on this spraying proposition is here in\r\nMinnesota, whether you have commercial orchards up here or not, I have\r\nnot been able to discover. I presume that your plantings here are very\r\nlargely that of the farmer and amateur rather than the commercial\r\norchardist. In Illinois we have our large commercial orchards, and we\r\nhave gotten beyond the question of whether it pays us to spray or not.\r\nFor a man to be in the commercial apple business in Illinois and not\r\nspray means that he doesn't accomplish very much and his product doesn't\r\nbring him any profit.\r\n\r\nNow, whether you spray commercially or whether you spray for your family\r\norchard in an amateur way, it doesn't matter so far as the spraying is\r\nconcerned--you should spray in either case. If you have a community\r\nwhere you have few orchards and they are small, it behooves you to get\r\ntogether and buy a spraying outfit, combine with your neighbors and buy\r\na good spraying outfit, and then have some man take that matter up who\r\nwill do it thoroughly in that neighborhood and pay him for doing it. In\r\nthat way, if you hire it done, it doesn't interfere with your farming\r\noperations and gets your spraying done on time. I have noticed this with\r\nstockmen and with grain farmers, men who are not directly interested in\r\nfruit but combine it with their regular business, that they consider\r\nfruit growing a side line and such a small part of their business that\r\nthey usually neglect it altogether. In the matter of the spraying they\r\nkeep putting it off until tomorrow. When the time arrives for spraying\r\nyou must do it _today_ and not put it off until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTime is a very essential element in spraying. To give you an\r\nillustration: A few years ago, in spraying a Willow Twig orchard,\r\nconsisting of eighteen rows of trees, I sprayed nine rows of those\r\ntrees, or about half of the orchard, we will say, the first part of the\r\nweek, the first two days. And then there came on a two or three days'\r\nrain, and the balance of those eighteen rows was sprayed the very last\r\nof the week or the first of the following week. The two following\r\nsprayings went on just at the right time for them, but when it came to\r\nthe harvesting of that crop the trees that were sprayed first, that were\r\nsprayed immediately after the bloom fell, produced 175 bushels of very\r\nfine No. 1 fruit, free from scab, while the other nine rows, equal in\r\nevery respect so far as the trees are concerned and the amount of bloom\r\nthere was, produced seventeen bushels of No. 2 fruit, no No. 1 fruit at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe Willow Twig is one of those varieties that is very susceptible to\r\nscab, and of course this is a marked illustration of what happens if you\r\ndon't spray at the right time. Notwithstanding the fact that the nine\r\nrows, the last ones, I speak of, were sprayed with the two following\r\nsprays at the same time that the other part of the orchard was sprayed,\r\nthe results were entirely different because the first spraying, which\r\nwas really the important one so far as the scab is concerned, was not\r\nput upon the tree at the right time.\r\n\r\nThe scab fungus, which seems to appear on your apples out here, is one\r\nof the most insidious diseases we have in the whole fruit industry. I\r\nthink that scab fungous disease is probably the one that affects you the\r\nmost. Now, scab fungus will not be noticed particularly in the spring of\r\nthe year. The time that those spores are most prevalent, the period of\r\ntheir movement as spores in the atmosphere and the lodging upon the\r\nfruit, is right at the beginning, right about the time of the blossoming\r\nor immediately following. For a period of about two weeks at blooming\r\ntime and after is the time that you have that condition.\r\n\r\nAnd the trouble is--it is just like typhoid fever. You let typhoid fever\r\nget into a family, and they do not think anything of it except to take\r\ncare of the patient properly if he has it, but it doesn't scare the\r\nneighbors, it does not interest them. But let the smallpox break out in\r\na community, and everybody is interested and scared to death for fear\r\nthey are going to get the smallpox.\r\n\r\nWell now, as compared with things of a fungous nature, the scab is a\r\ngood deal like typhoid fever. The latter is insidious and it will\r\ndestroy more--I take it there are more people die in the United States\r\nof typhoid fever every year than die of smallpox, ten to one. I haven't\r\nthe statistics but I have that in mind, that it is a fact that they do,\r\nand yet there isn't half the fuss made about typhoid fever that there is\r\nabout smallpox.\r\n\r\nNow, that is so about the scab fungous disease. In Illinois, to\r\nillustrate, we have what is called the bitter rot fungus in the southern\r\npart of the state. If any one has the bitter rot they are scared to\r\ndeath, they think they are suffering untold misfortune. The bitter rot\r\nattacks the apples when nearly grown. The ground is covered with the\r\nrotted apples, and you can see them in the trees, but this little bit of\r\nscab fungus, they do not seem to notice that.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this, that scab comes from very minute spores that appear\r\nupon the apples in May or June, and as the summer advances they spread\r\nmore and more. It depends, of course, upon the amount of moisture there\r\nis present, but it begins its work when the apples are very small. If it\r\ngets upon the stem of the apple it works around the stem and the apple\r\ndrops off, and you have apples dropping from the time they are the size\r\nof peas until the very last of the fall, and while it looks in the month\r\nof June as if you are going to have a good crop of apples when it comes\r\nharvest time your crop has diminished greatly or to nothing, and you\r\nwonder where it has gone. With this scab fungus they just keep dropping,\r\ndropping, all through the season; whenever you have a little rain or\r\nwind these apples that are affected will drop off. You don't notice them\r\nvery much because they go so gradually, one at a time or so, and you\r\ndon't notice you are having any particular loss until it comes fall, and\r\nyou find that your crop is very small.\r\n\r\nThat is why I say, you should wake up to the fact that it is necessary\r\nfor you to spray if you are going to have perfect fruit and plenty of\r\nit--and I doubt not you could increase the amount of fruit you have in\r\nthe State of Minnesota by ten times in one year by simply spraying your\r\norchards thoroughly at the proper time with fungicide.\r\n\r\nTo do this, as I said, you must have a spraying outfit, individually or\r\ncollectively, in your neighborhood, and if you get one individually you\r\ncan take the contract to spray your neighbor's trees, if you wish, and\r\nget back enough to pay you for the outlay. If you have only a few trees\r\nand you have some one who understands it, you could just as well spray a\r\nfew other orchards in the neighborhood and get your spraying done for\r\nnothing in that way, charging them enough to cover the cost and enough\r\nfor some profit. That is done in some sections and is a very\r\nsatisfactory way.\r\n\r\nThe only way, however, that I would do this, if I were you, would be to\r\nenter into a joint arrangement of not less than five years, because if\r\nyou do it from year to year, if a man has good fruit one year, he may\r\nsay, \"I guess I don't want to go to that expense this year; I will drop\r\nthat.\" You know how it is. If you make a contract for five years then\r\nyou can make your plans accordingly and get your material and your\r\nspraying outfit and everything. I wouldn't trust to a one-year plan\r\nbecause they get \"cold feet,\" as the saying is, after the first year,\r\nand perhaps they have not noticed any great advantage and they back\r\nout, but if they keep it up five years they wouldn't be without it.\r\n\r\nIn a small way it isn't necessary to have a high power, high pressure\r\nengine to do this spraying with. A _good_ hand pump, as they make them\r\nnow, has a very efficient force in applying this spray. It is not the\r\nforce with which the spray material is applied that makes it effective,\r\nso much as it is the thoroughness with which it is done. You have to do\r\na thorough job. In spraying you are providing insurance for your apple\r\ncrop. That is just what it means, and not to spray is like doing without\r\nfire insurance on your buildings. You do that, not because you want\r\nfire, but you are doing it for protection, you are going to be on the\r\nsafe side. You are doing like the darkey woman when she was about to be\r\nmarried. She had been working as cook, and the day came for her to be\r\nmarried. That morning she brought a roll of bills down to the boss. She\r\nsaid: \"Mr. Johnson, I wish you would keep this money for me. I's gwine\r\nto be married.\" He said: \"Is that so? But why do you come to me with\r\nthis? I should think having a husband you would have him take care of it\r\nfor you.\" She said: \"Lord a' massy. Do you think I was gwine to have\r\nthat money around the house wid dat strange nigger there? No, sir.\"\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThat lady was taking the precaution of being on the safe side, and that\r\nis what we do when we spray our orchards, we are going to be safe.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many kinds of spraying materials. There is the\r\nbordeaux, one of our best fungicides, but we find in Illinois that it\r\nalso, while it is a good fungicide, has the effect sometimes of burning\r\nthe fruit if the weather conditions are just right. If you have pretty\r\nfair weather conditions up here and don't have too much rain, you\r\nprobably would not get your fruit affected too much, and if you are not\r\ngrowing it for market it doesn't matter so much because all it does is\r\nto russet the fruit. It doesn't do any particular harm except when the\r\nscab fungus is especially bad, for then it does injure the foliage more\r\nor less. On the whole, in Illinois, we are using the lime-sulphur in\r\npreference to the bordeaux, and our commercial orchard growers there\r\nhave completely abandoned the bordeaux except for bitter rot fungus or\r\nblotch fungus, which comes late in the season. The spray just before the\r\nbloom is a very important one for the scab fungus. After you can see the\r\npink of the bloom on the trees as they begin to look pink, before the\r\nblossoms open, put on your lime-sulphur, or you can use bordeaux mixture\r\nat that time if you prefer it, without injury to your fruit.\r\n\r\n(To be continued in April No.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEverbearing Strawberries.\r\n\r\nGEO. J. KELLOGG, JANESVILLE, WIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words about this new breed. Progressive, Superb and Americus are\r\nthe best three I have found in the last ten years--don't confound\r\nAmerican with Americus. Pan-American was the mother of the whole tribe.\r\nThis variety was found in a field of Bismark, by S. Cooper, New York,\r\nand exhibited all through the Buffalo World's Fair. There is where my\r\nfirst acquaintance with it was formed. From this one plant and its\r\nseedlings all the ten thousand everbearers have been grown. But\r\nPan-American don't make many plants. There are a great many good kinds\r\nin the ten thousand, and a great many of them worthless. So look out\r\nwhen and where you buy. I have great hopes of your No. 1017, but kinds\r\ndo not adapt themselves to all soils or climates.\r\n\r\nI have not found any success with the everbearers south of the Ohio. I\r\nhave tried them three years in Texas. I sent plants to Bro. Loring, in\r\nCalifornia, and they failed to produce satisfactorily. Missouri grows\r\nalmost all Aroma; California but two kinds commercially; Texas only\r\nExcelsior and Klondike for shipment. I hope our No. 3 Minnesota\r\nJune-bearing and our No. 1017 Everbearing, will have as great a range as\r\nDunlap.\r\n\r\nFriend Gardener, of Iowa, has a lot of \"thousand dollar kinds.\" I hope\r\nsome of them will do wonders. He sold 5,000 quarts of fruit after August\r\n15. A firm at Three Rivers, Mich., this season advertised 30,000 cases\r\nin September, but perhaps it was only 3,000; I have known printers to\r\nmake mistakes. My boy's beds of Superb, Progressive and Americus were\r\nloaded with ripe and green fruit and blossoms October 1st this year.\r\nMost, if not all, know the fruit must be kept off the everbearers the\r\nseason of planting till the plants get established, usually two or three\r\nmonths, then let them bear. If you want all fruit, keep off the runners;\r\nif all plants, keep off the fruit. Beds kept over that have exhausted\r\nthemselves will need rest till July to give big crops. Beds kept over\r\nwill fruit a week earlier than the June varieties, rest a few weeks,\r\nthen give a fall crop, but don't expect too much unless you feed them.\r\n\r\nThere are ten thousand kinds of new everbearers, so don't buy any that\r\nhave not been tried and proven worthy. There are thousands that are\r\nworthless. Friend Haralson only got No. 1017 out of 1,500 sorts. He has\r\nnow 3,000 new kinds, set out four feet apart each way, he is testing.\r\nFrom what many growers are doing this breed will pay commercially, but\r\nit will be by experts. I have not time to advocate cultivation in hills\r\nor hedge rows; if you want big berries this is the way to get them. Be\r\nsure your straw mulch and manure mulch are free from noxious weed or\r\nclover and grass seeds. Everbearers need the same winter care as June\r\nvarieties and a good deal more manure. Don't cover with asparagus tops\r\nunless free of seed. Put manure either fresh or rotted on the old bed\r\nwith a manure spreader or evenly by hand. There is a possibility of\r\nmanuring too heavily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical everbearing strawberry plant as it appears in\r\nSeptember.]\r\n\r\nMr. Durand: What is the best spray for leaf-spot and rust in\r\nstrawberries?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Cut it out and burn it, but then there are some sprays with\r\nbordeaux mixture that will help you, but you have got to put it on\r\nbefore the rust shows itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: I would like to ask Mr. Kellogg if he advises covering the\r\nstrawberries in the winter after snow has fallen and with what success?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: If the snow isn't too heavy you can do it just as well\r\nafter the snow comes as before, but if your snow comes early and is a\r\nfoot deep you have got to wait until the January thaw before you can\r\nsuccessfully mulch them. That snow will protect them until it thaws off,\r\nuntil the ground commences to freeze. If the snow comes early and stays\r\nlate it is all the mulch you need.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin: Are oak leaves as they blow off from the trees on the\r\nstrawberry beds, are they just as good to protect them as straw would\r\nbe--when there are lots of oak leaves?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: If you don't put them on too thick. You don't want more\r\nthan two inches of leaves. If you do they will mat down and smother your\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Have you had any experience with using cornstalks that have\r\nbeen fed off, just the stalk without the leaves. Is that sufficient for\r\na winter protection without the straw or leaves? I put on mine just to\r\ncover them. They are four inches apart one way and then across it the\r\nother way so as to hold it up and not get them smothered.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That is all right. I have covered with cornstalks.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Would it be policy to leave that on and let the strawberries\r\ncome up through, to keep them clean?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: If you get the stalks on one way and haven't them covered\r\ntoo thick the other way, leave them on; the strawberries will come\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nMr. Gowdy: I would like to ask Mr. Kellogg what he thinks of planting\r\ndifferent varieties together.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: It is a good plan. I spoke of Dunlap and Warfield. The\r\nWarfield is a pistillate. If you plant all Warfields you get no fruit.\r\nIf you plant all Dunlap it will bear well but it will do better\r\nalongside of a pistillate, or it will do better alongside of some other\r\nperfect. It will do better to plant two or four kinds. They used to ask\r\nme what kinds of strawberries I wanted, and what was the best one kind.\r\nI told them I wanted six or eight in order to get the best kind. I want\r\nan early, and a medium, and a late, two of a kind.\r\n\r\nMr. Gowdy: I planted one year three varieties with great success.\r\n\r\nMr. McClelland: What time do you uncover your strawberries?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I don't uncover them at all. If you got on four inches of\r\nmulch you want to take off enough so the plants can get through, but\r\nkeep on enough mulch in the spring to keep your plants clean and protect\r\nfrom the drouth.\r\n\r\nMr. McClelland: Will they come through the mulch all right?\r\n\r\nM. Kellogg: They will come through all right if it isn't more than two\r\ninches. If they shove up and raise the mulch open it up a little over\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard: I would like to ask the speaker, the way I understood him,\r\nwhy he couldn't raise as good strawberries on new ground as on old\r\nground?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: The soil seems to be too loose. Now, that twenty-one acres\r\nI had, it was full of leaf-mold. It was six inches deep and had been\r\naccumulating for ages. I couldn't account for it only that it was too\r\nloose, and I had to work it down with other crops before I could grow\r\nstrawberries.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard: So it would be better to plant on old ground or old\r\nbreaking than new?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Yes, old ground that has been well manured, or old ground\r\nthat has never been manured, will grow better strawberries than new\r\nsoil, as far as I have tried it. New clover soil is a good soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: It might add to the value of this discussion to state that\r\nMr. Kellogg's soil at Janesville is rather light soil anyhow. I am under\r\nthe impression that if his soil at Janesville which produced so poorly\r\non new soil had been a heavy clay soil that the result would have been\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That twenty-one acres was clay after you got down to it and\r\nwas in the woods; my other fields were out on the prairie. I don't think\r\nthe light soil had anything to do with it, with my failure in the woods,\r\nI think it was the new soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Can the everbearing and the common varieties be planted\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Yes, if you are growing plants you want everything.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: How far apart must they be planted?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: So their runners won't run together, and they won't mix. If\r\nthe runners mix maybe you would get some crosses that are valuable.\r\n\r\nMr. Clausen: I was just thinking it might interfere, that some one might\r\nnot plant strawberries at all on account of new soil. I would say I have\r\na neighbor, and he had entirely new soil. It was black oak and\r\nhickory--I have some of that myself. I never saw a better patch of\r\nstrawberries than he had. I don't think I ever saw a better strawberry\r\npatch than he had of the everbearing kind, so I don't think it is just\r\nexactly the old soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Willis: I have my strawberries on new ground, and they did very\r\nfine, couldn't be better. From a space of five feet square I got\r\ntwenty-eight boxes, that is, of No. 3.\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: Forest soil or prairie?\r\n\r\nMr. Willis: It was light clay. I have got about an acre and a half on\r\nnew soil now, and they look very fine.\r\n\r\nMr. Glenzke: What would be the consequence of the berries being planted\r\nafter tomatoes had been planted there the year before? What would be the\r\nconsequence as to the white grub that follows the tomatoes, and other\r\ninsects?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That white grub don't follow tomatoes, if the ground was\r\nclear of white grubs before. It is a three year old grub, and it don't\r\ncome excepting where the ground is a marsh or meadow, and doesn't\r\nfollow in garden soil, hardly ever. If the ground has been cultivated\r\ntwo years, you don't have any white grub.\r\n\r\nMr. Glenzke: Part of this ground had been in red raspberries, and I\r\nfound them there. This year I am going to put in tomatoes and prepare it\r\nfor strawberries. Will that be all right?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: You may get some white grubs after the raspberry bushes if\r\nyour raspberries have been two or three years growing. Potato ground is\r\nthe best you can follow strawberries with.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen (Wisconsin): What trouble have you experienced with\r\noverhead irrigation with the strawberries in the bright sunshine?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Everything is against it. You wet the foliage, and it is a\r\ndamage to the plants. You can't sprinkle in the hot sun without damage.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: I didn't mean in putting it on in that way, but where you\r\nuse the regular spray system. We watered that way about seven years in\r\nthe hottest sunshine without any difficulty, and I wondered if you ever\r\nput in a system and sprayed that way, as I think that is the only way to\r\nput water on.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: If you wait to spray after sundown it will be all right;\r\nthe sun mustn't shine on the plants.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Mr. Yankee once said in this society if one man said\r\nanything another man would contradict it. So pay your money and take\r\nyour choice. I sprinkle my strawberries in the hot sun, and I never had\r\nany damage done to the plants. His experience is different. Ours is a\r\nheavy clay loam.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Tell the gentlemen about the peat soil, you had some\r\nexperience with peat soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: No, I never did. It wasn't peat, it was a heavy black\r\nclay and I had the best kind of strawberries, they came right through a\r\ntremendous drouth without any water at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What did you use?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I used a common garden hoe.\r\n\r\nMr. Willis: I heard some one talking about the grub worm. I read of\r\nsomebody using fifty pounds of lime to the acre, slaked lime, and 100\r\npounds of sulphur to the acre in a strawberry bed, and he killed the\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I think that wouldn't kill the grub; he has a stomach that\r\nwill stand most anything. The only thing I know is to cut his head off.\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Willis: Would it improve the plants, fertilize the plants, this\r\nlime?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Lime and sulphur is all right, and the more lime you put on\r\nthe better--if you don't get too much. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I am growing the Minnesota No. 3, and also the No. 1017 as\r\nan everbearer. Is there any kind better than those two?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I don't believe there is anything yet that has been offered\r\nor brought out that I have examined thoroughly that is any better than\r\nJune variety No. 3, as grown by Haralson, and the No. 1017 of the\r\neverbearers. He had a number of everbearers that bore too much. There\r\nwas No. 107 and No. 108, I think, that I tried at Lake Mills, which bore\r\nthemselves to death in spite of everything I could do.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons: The question has come up two or three times in regard to\r\npeat soil for growing strawberries. Peat soil will grow strawberry\r\nplants first class, but the fruit is generally lacking. That is my\r\nexperience. I grew some on peat soil for two or three seasons, and the\r\nplants grew prolific, but I didn't get any fruit.\r\n\r\nMr. Ebler: I would like to ask Mr. Kellogg what treatment he would\r\nadvise for a strawberry bed that through neglect has matted completely\r\nover, in which the rows have disappeared.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Plow out paths and rake out the plants and throw them away\r\nand work the bed over to rows about two feet wide.\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: I see you all appreciate expert advice. We have Mr.\r\nKellogg well nigh tired.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Oh, no; I can stand it all day.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: I am sure you all agree that it is a great privilege to\r\nlisten to Mr. Kellogg on this subject. If you will follow his advice\r\nvery closely it will save you a great many dollars, even to those who\r\ndon't grow more than an ordinary family strawberry bed. He has had forty\r\nor fifty years of experience, and he has paid large sums of money for\r\nthat experience and now turns it over to you free of charge, and I hope\r\nyou will all profit by it.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I have grown probably 300 different varieties of\r\nstrawberries, and the more kinds I grow the less money I make.\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: I would like to ask Mr. Kellogg and I think we would all be\r\ninterested in knowing when he began growing strawberries?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Well, I don't hardly know. I didn't go into the business\r\nuntil 1852, but I commenced picking strawberries in 1835, and that was\r\nwhere the Indians had planted them. My father commenced growing\r\nstrawberries when I was a boy, but when I got to be a man I went at it\r\nmyself in 1852. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_IN MEMORIAM--Mrs. Melissa J. Harris_\r\n\r\nPassed January 29, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Melissa J. Harris, widow of the late John S. Harris, one of the\r\ncharter members of our society and rightly called the godfather of the\r\nsociety, passed to her reward on January 29 last, at the age of\r\neighty-five years. Since the death of her husband, which occurred in\r\nMarch, 1901, Mrs. Harris has made her home with some one of her four\r\nsurviving children, all of whom live in the southeastern part of the\r\nstate, not far from La Crescent, where Mr. and Mrs. Harris resided from\r\n1856 up to the time of Mr. Harris' death, some forty-five years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Melissa J. Harris.]\r\n\r\nMany of the older members of this society have enjoyed the hospitality\r\nof this kindly home, among them the writer, who passed a very pleasant\r\nday there, looking over the experimental orchards of Mr. Harris, some\r\ntwenty years ago. No member of our society surpassed Mr. Harris in his\r\nzeal for its welfare, and he was ready to sacrifice anything apparently\r\nto advance its interests. If the card index of the reports of this\r\nsociety was examined it would be found that no member has begun to do\r\nthe service for the society in the way of contributions to its program,\r\nreports on seedling fruits, experimental work, etc., that was done by\r\nhim. His passing left a real void in the life of the association which\r\nhas never really been filled. A splendid life size photo of Mr. Harris\r\nadorns the walls of this office; a reproduction from this in reduced\r\nsize is opposite page 161, Vol. 1901 of our annual reports.\r\n\r\nThe funeral services of Mrs. Harris were conducted in the Presbyterian\r\nchurch at La Crescent, the same building in which services were held\r\nfor her husband, at which there were present from our society as\r\nrepresentatives Mr. J.M. Underwood, the late Wyman Elliot, and the\r\nwriter. Her body was laid to rest beside that of her husband in Prospect\r\nHill Cemetery at La Crescent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harris is survived by four children, ten grandchildren, and nine\r\ngreat-grandchildren. Frank I. Harris, one of the two sons, is well known\r\nto our membership who attend the annual meetings or the state fair;\r\nanother son, Eugene E., who is also a life member (Mr. Harris saw to it\r\nthat both of his sons were made life members during his life time) has\r\noccasionally been with us. Mr. D.C. Webster, of La Crescent, at present\r\nin charge of one of the society trial stations, is a grandson of Mrs.\r\nHarris. Exhibitors at our meetings and at the state fair are all well\r\nacquainted with this valuable member of our organization.--Secy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEAT MINNESOTA APPLES.\r\n\r\nContributed monthly by R. S. MACKINTOSH, Horticulturist,\r\nExtension Division, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nFRUIT NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly spring is the best time to prune apple trees. More and more\r\nattention is being given to the pruning of young and old trees in order\r\nthat they may be able to support large loads of fruit. Yet too many\r\ntrees have been neglected and now look like brush heaps instead of fruit\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nNeglected trees should have all dead and interlocking branches removed\r\nthis year. Next year a few more needless branches should be taken out\r\nand some of the others shortened. After this a little attention each\r\nyear will keep the tree in good form.\r\n\r\nEach year the Agricultural Extension Division of the University of\r\nMinnesota arranges for pruning and spraying demonstrations in different\r\norchards of the state. Communities wishing this kind of help, should at\r\nonce send in petitions signed by fifteen or more persons interested in\r\nfruit growing. Send applications to Director, Agricultural Extension\r\nDivision, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nPruning is a good subject for farmers' clubs to take up in March and\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nLook out for rabbit injury this spring. Apple trees cost too much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cypripedia_, by Miss Clara Leavitt.\r\n\r\nThe showy lady's slipper (C. hirsutum) is found in swamps and rich\r\nmeadows. Old settlers tell of gathering the pink and white \"moccasin\r\nflower\" by the bushel, to decorate for some special occasion. Today we\r\nare trying to shield a few in their last hiding places. The draining of\r\nswamps and cutting of meadows has had much to do with their\r\ndisappearance. The picking of the leafy stem by the ruthless \"flower\r\nlover\" cripples the plant for a season or more and frequently kills it\r\noutright. Attempts to transfer it to the home garden have succeeded for\r\na year or so but rarely longer, perhaps because its native habitat is\r\nvery difficult to duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe small yellow lady's slipper (C. parviflorum), found in bogs, and the\r\nlarge yellow (C. parviflorum var. pubescens), growing on hillsides and\r\nin rich woods, as well as in swamps, are the most widely distributed and\r\nbest known of this genus. They have often been transferred from the wild\r\nto the home garden. Where they have been given their native soil and\r\nenvironment the stock has increased and seedlings have developed. They\r\nhave even been brought into conservatory or window garden and forced to\r\nflower in February.\r\n\r\nThe crimson stemless lady's slipper (C. acaule) is found in drier woods\r\nand on the stump knolls of swamps in certain locations. It has with\r\ndifficulty been established in a few gardens.\r\n\r\nThe small white lady's slipper (C. candidum) occurs locally in boggy\r\nmeadows. It is a very dainty plant. It grows in at least one wild\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe ram's head lady slipper (C. arietinum) is very rare and local. It is\r\na very delicate and pretty thing, purple and white in color.\r\n\r\nAll of these species are to be seen in season in the Wild Garden of the\r\nMinneapolis Park System.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommittee on the protection of Cypripedia: Mrs. Phelps Wyman, chairman;\r\nMiss Clara Leavitt, Miss M.

Allowing\r\nfor mistakes which were made in making up this census, there is no doubt\r\nthat the average amount of honey produced by a colony is not nearly as\r\nhigh as efficient beekeeping would make it. When some well known\r\nbeekeepers will average year after year fifty, seventy and even a\r\nhundred pounds per colony, there must be something wrong with those who\r\nfall far below this amount.\r\n\r\nThere are many causes responsible for this failure of honey crops. Bad\r\nmanagement, no management at all, antiquated or impossible equipment,\r\nlocality, etc., are all factors contributing towards a shortage in the\r\nhoney crop, but poor queens are the most universal cause of\r\ndisappointment. The queen being the mother of the whole colony of bees,\r\nthe hive will be what she is. If she is of a pure, industrious, gentle,\r\nhardy and prolific strain, the colony over which she presides will be\r\nuniform, hard working, easy to handle, easy to brave the inclemency of\r\nthe weather and the severity of our winters, and populous in bees. The\r\nbees partake of the characteristics of the queen.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, that more than 90% of our Minnesota queens\r\nare either black Germans or hybrids, neither of which lend themselves to\r\npleasant and profitable beekeeping. Having been inbred for years will\r\nmake them still less valuable, and most of them have been inbred for\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAmong many things in which the beekeepers of Minnesota should begin to\r\nimprove their beekeeping possibilities, the necessity of good queens\r\ncomes first. With a new strain of pure, gentle, industrious, leather\r\ncolored Italian bees, their love for beekeeping should receive a new\r\nimpetus, leading them to better equipment and better management.\r\n\r\nIt was with this point in view that the University of Minnesota has\r\nsecured the best breeding queens obtainable from which to raise several\r\nthousands of queens for the use of beekeepers of the state.\r\n\r\nThese queens will be sold each year during the months of June, July and\r\nAugust at a nominal price of fifty cents each, and not more than three\r\nto each beekeeper. The University is ready to book orders now. There is\r\nsuch a demand for these queens that last year only one-quarter of the\r\norders could be filled. Given three pure Italian queens to start with, a\r\nbeekeeper may easily re-queen his whole bee-yard in the course of a\r\nyear. Detailed printed instructions how to proceed will be sent out to\r\nall buyers of queens free of charge.\r\n\r\nTime has come to start bee-keeping on a more profitable basis, and the\r\nfirst step towards better success should be a new strain of queens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTOMOLOGICAL NOTES\r\n\r\nBy F.L. WASHBURN, Professor of Entomology, University of\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS; RABBIT-PROOF FENCES; FIELD MICE.\r\n\r\nProbably the thoughtful orchardist has before this date visited his\r\norchard and trampled the deep snow down around his young fruit trees for\r\na distance of two feet on all sides of each trunk, thus preventing\r\nrabbits from reaching the trunk above the protected part, or from eating\r\nthe branches in the case of low-headed trees. Even at this date, this\r\nshould be done where the snow lies deep. Frequent tramplings about the\r\nyoung trees also protects the trees from possible injury by field mice\r\nworking beneath the snow.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to speak of our experiences with so-called \"rabbit-proof\"\r\nfencing. In the summer time, when an abundance of food is everywhere\r\noffered, these small mesh fences are generally effective barriers, but,\r\nin the case of the low fences, drifting snow in winter permits an easy\r\ncrossing, and in the case of the higher fences which have the narrow\r\nmesh at the bottom, gradually widening toward the top, it is possible\r\nfor a rabbit to get his head and body through a surprisingly small space\r\nbetween the wires. The writer was astonished, late last autumn, previous\r\nto any snowfall, to see one of these pests, which had jumped from its\r\n\"nest\" in his (the writer's) covered strawberry-bed, run to the\r\ninclosing fence, which was provided with the long, narrow mesh above\r\nalluded to, raise himself on his hind feet and push his way through a\r\nspace not more than three inches wide. It would seem, therefore, that\r\none should accept with some reservation the assertion that these fences\r\nare actually \"rabbit-proof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPAREDNESS FOR (INSECT) WAR.\r\n\r\nHowever one may regard the agitation for or against preparing this\r\ncountry for (or against) war, we are doubtless of all one mind as to the\r\ndesirability of being prepared to successfully cope with the various\r\ninsect-pests which are sure to arrive during the coming spring and\r\nsummer to attack shrubs, fruit trees, berry bushes, melons, cucumbers\r\nand practically all of our vegetables. The Entomologist has every reason\r\nto be thankful that, early last spring, he laid in a supply of arsenate\r\nof lead, Black Leaf No. 40, commercial lime-sulphur, tree tanglefoot,\r\ntobacco dust, also providing himself with an abundance of air-slaked\r\nlime and a spraying outfit suitable for use in a small experiment garden\r\nand orchard at Lake Minnetonka. All gardeners, particularly those who\r\ncannot quickly purchase such things on account of distance from a\r\nsupply, should take time by the forelock and obtain materials now, that\r\nthey may be ready at hand when very much needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IN ENTOMOLOGY.\r\n\r\nAn item of importance, and quite far-reaching in its significance is the\r\nfact (as reported at the recent meeting of entomologists at Columbus)\r\nthat the odor in stable manure which attracts house flies, has been\r\n\"artificially\" produced, if that expression may be used, by a\r\ncombination of ammonia and a little butyric acid. A pan of this, covered\r\nby cotton, attracted hundreds of flies which deposited their eggs\r\nthereon. The possibilities of making use of this new-found fact are most\r\npromising, and the discovery is especially significant in that it opens\r\nan immense and practically an untried field in entomological work; that\r\nis, the making use of different odors to attract different species of\r\ninsects. A series of experiments in this direction with the Mediteranean\r\nfruit fly, also recently reported, have been most surprising but too\r\nextensive to permit of discussion here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNurserymen intending to import currants or gooseberries from Europe will\r\nbe interested in learning that there is a possibility of a federal\r\nquarantine on shrubs of this genus grown abroad.\r\n\r\nState Entomologist Circular No. 36, issued in January, 1916, and\r\nentitled the \"Red Rose Beetle,\" by S. Marcovitch (illustrated), is\r\navailable for distribution. Application should be accompanied by one\r\ncent stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS.--It is well established that in\r\ncertain localities at least in the state commercial orcharding is on a\r\nsafe basis, offering reasonable financial profits if managed by those\r\nwho take pains to inform themselves on the subject, and are then\r\nthorough going enough to practice what they know. This spring will be a\r\ngood time to plant such an orchard. Orchard trees of suitable size were\r\nnever more plentiful in the nurseries, and undoubtedly the sorts which\r\nyou wish to plant can be readily purchased. Ask some of your nearest\r\nnurseries for prices as to 500 trees, either two or three years old,\r\nwhichever you prefer.\r\n\r\nGIVE YOUR NEIGHBOR A CHANCE TOO.--This means that you should\r\nnot be satisfied simply in having secured something of value to\r\nyourself, but pass on to others the valuable opportunity which you\r\nyourself are enjoying. It is a well established principle of life that\r\nthe greatest happiness consists in giving happiness to others. As any\r\nmember can do his neighbor a favor, without any expense to himself, and\r\nindeed with profit, by putting his neighbor in touch with the valuable\r\nfacilities offered by the Horticultural Society, there is evidently a\r\ndouble reason why he should do so. For the small membership fee charged\r\nyou can put into his hands all the material referred to on the next\r\npage. Read it over and lend your neighbor a helping hand.\r\n\r\nTIMELY NOTES IN OUR MONTHLY.--There will be in our monthly\r\nmagazine during most of the rest of the months of the year five pages\r\ndevoted to timely topics. The experience of the past year or two in this\r\ndirection encourages us to believe that this will prove to be the most\r\nvaluable portion of our monthly. One page, as heretofore, will be\r\noperated in the interest of garden flowers, edited by Mrs. E. W. Gould;\r\nanother page, prepared by Prof. R.S. Mackintosh, under the head of\r\n\"fruit notes,\" which subject indicates clearly its purpose. Prof.\r\nFrancis Jager, the Apiarist at University Farm, will prepare another\r\npage, pertaining to the keeping of bees. Prof. F.L. Washburn, the State\r\nEntomologist, will have a page devoted to insect life as interesting the\r\nhorticulturist. The fifth page will be handled by Profs. A.G. Ruggles\r\nand E.C. Stakman jointly devoted entirely to the subject of \"spraying.\"\r\nEach issue of the magazine will contain these notes as applying to the\r\nmonth just following. They will be found well worth studying.\r\n\r\nARE YOU A LIFE MEMBER?--Of course if you are interested in the\r\nwork of the Horticultural Society and likely to live ten years you ought\r\nto be a life member. Experience with this roll for twenty-five years now\r\nas secretary of the society indicates that a life membership in the\r\nsociety is almost an assurance that you will prolong your days. A list\r\nof deaths in the life membership roll published year by year would\r\nindicate that our life members are going to be with us far beyond the\r\naverage span of human life. Since publishing a list of new life members\r\nin the February Horticulturist, there have been added to this life list\r\nfive names: Tosten E. Dybdal, Elbow Lake, Minn.; Gust Carlson,\r\nExcelsior; A.N. Gray, Deerwood; A.M. Christianson, Bismarck, N.D.; Chas.\r\nH. Lien, St. Cloud.\r\n\r\nIf you have already paid your annual fee for this year, send us $4.00\r\nmore and your name will be placed on the life roll with the balance of\r\n$5.00 to be paid one year from how--or send $9.00, and that makes a full\r\npayment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORTICULTURAL BUILDING (SHOWING NEW GREENHOUSES\r\nATTACHED) AT UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. ANTHONY PARK, MINN.]\r\n\r\n     While it is not the intention to publish anything in this\r\n     magazine that is misleading or unreliable, yet it must be\r\n     remembered that the articles published herein recite the\r\n     experience and opinions of their writers, and this fact must\r\n     always be noted in estimating their practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST\r\n\r\nVol. 44 APRIL, 1916 No. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDwarf Apple Trees.\r\n\r\nDR. O.M. HUESTIS, MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have here a sample of McIntosh Red grown on a standard tree--a\r\nbeautiful apple and well colored. Here I have the same variety grown on\r\none of my dwarf trees, not quite as well colored.\r\n\r\nNow, the dwarf tree that bore these apples has been planted two years;\r\nthis is the second year of its growth in my own ground at Mound, on Lake\r\nMinnetonka.\r\n\r\nI have sixty dwarf trees, five of which have been in eight years, and\r\nthey have borne six crops of apples. The last ones I got two years ago,\r\nand they were two years old when I got them. I planted five of these\r\ndwarf trees at the same time that I planted forty standards. The dwarfs\r\nhave borne more fruit than the standards up to date. Of course, they\r\nhave only been in eight years. The standards are Wealthy, Duchess,\r\nNorthwestern Greening and one or two Hibernal and some crabs; the dwarf\r\nstock is the Doucin. It is not the Paradise stock, which is grown in\r\nEngland largely and some in France and Germany. My trees are a little\r\nhigher than my head, and I keep them pruned in a certain way. One of my\r\nolder trees the second year had ninety-six apples on it. It was a Yellow\r\nTransparent, and they came to maturity very well. Several of my trees\r\nare about four feet high. I had from twenty-five to fifty apples on\r\nthem, and they all ripened nicely. The Red Astrachan and the Gravenstein\r\nand one Alexander had a few apples on them, and I notice that they are\r\nwell loaded with fruit buds for another year, which will be the third\r\nyear planted.\r\n\r\nThe care of these trees is probably a little more difficult than that of\r\nthe standard tree, or, at least, I give them special care. I have\r\nattempted to bud into some of these, but in my experience they do not\r\ntake the bud very well. I can take a bud from one of the dwarfs and put\r\nit on a standard, and it will grow all right, but I can't take a bud\r\nfrom a standard and put it on a dwarf as successfully. I judge it is\r\nbecause it isn't as rapid growing as the Hibernal, for instance, would\r\nbe. I notice the Hibernal is the best to take a bud because it is a\r\nrapid growing tree and an excellent one on which to graft.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to plant an orchard of forty or fifty acres I would plant\r\nstandard trees and would put the dwarf between the rows, probably twelve\r\nfeet apart. Mine are about ten feet apart, some of them a little more,\r\nbut I have two rows eight feet apart each way, nine in each row, which\r\nforms a double hedge. I expect them to grow four feet high. I will prune\r\nthem just as I wish to make a beautiful double hedge between two\r\ncottages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of Dr. Huestis, at Mound, Lake Minnetonka.]\r\n\r\nIn pruning those that have been in eight years I have tried to use the\r\nrenewal system as we use it on grapes sometimes. I take out some of the\r\nolder branches and fruit spurs that have borne two or three years. They\r\nmust be thinned out. I counted twenty apples on a branch a foot long. I\r\nlet them grow until they are large enough to stew and then take some off\r\nand use them, when apple sauce is appreciated. I thin them every year\r\nand get a nice lot of good fruit each year.\r\n\r\nI have noticed for two years that I have about ninety-eight per cent. of\r\nperfect apples, not a blotch nor a worm. I spray them all, first the\r\ndormant spray and then just as the blossoms are falling, and then one\r\nother spraying in two weeks and another spray three weeks later.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Do you mulch the ground?\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: Well, I dig up the ground a little in the spring. The roots\r\nare very near the surface, not very penetrating, and I cultivate around\r\nthe roots, but I am careful not to cut them. Every fall I put a good\r\nmulch of leaves and hay around them. I have been a little fearful they\r\nwould winter-kill. I wouldn't lose one of them for ten dollars, and I\r\nthink it well to mulch them, leaving a little space at the base.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Are the roots exposed in some cases?\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: Yes, I noticed on two of the older trees, those that have\r\nbeen in eight years and have borne six crops, you can see the roots on\r\none side, the top is exposed a little, and I think it would be well to\r\nput a little dirt on those another year. The stock of these dwarf trees\r\nis slow growing with a rapid growing top, and that is what dwarfs them.\r\nI have transplanted one tree three times, which would make four\r\nplantings in eight years, and that tree bore almost as much fruit last\r\nyear as any of them. In another case once transplanted I think the tree\r\nis better than the others that were left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dwarf Yellow Transparent, bearing 96 apples, third year\r\nfrom planting at Dr. Huestis'.]\r\n\r\nAs I said before, if I was planting an orchard I would put dwarf trees\r\nbetween, and by the time they had borne three or four crops, and you\r\nwere expecting a crop of fruit from the standard trees--about seven\r\nyears from the time you put them in--I would put the dwarf trees as\r\nfillers, costing about forty cents apiece, and by the time they are\r\nbearing nicely your friends would have seen those, and I believe would\r\nwant them at the time you want to take them out. I believe I could sell\r\nany of mine for three or four dollars apiece. I think that would be one\r\nway of disposing of them after you wanted to take them out of the\r\nstandard orchard on account of room. That is just a thought of mine.\r\n\r\nWhen I got my first ones eight years ago I gave one to a man who lives\r\nin North Minneapolis, at 1824 Bryant Avenue North. Any one can see it\r\nwho lives up in that section. The first year he had twenty-nine apples,\r\nand it has borne each year since. The one which I have transplanted and\r\nwhich bore last year is a Bismarck. It is a little better apple, in my\r\nmind, than the Duchess. It is a good deal like the Duchess but is a\r\nbetter keeper and has a better flavor than the Duchess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dwarf Bismarck, fourth year, at Dr. Huestis']\r\n\r\nI would like to read a quotation to show that the dwarf tree is not a\r\nlate thing. Recommending dwarf trees for gardens, \"Corbett's English\r\nGarden,\" published in 1829, says: \"I do hope if any gentleman makes a\r\ngarden he will never suffer it to be disfigured by the folly of a\r\nstandard tree, which the more vigorous its growth the more mischievous\r\nits growth to the garden.\"\r\n\r\nMarshall says, \"The fewer standard trees in the garden the better.\" Also\r\nthat the dwarfs are less trouble to keep in order and are generally more\r\nproductive, and that \"placed eight or nine feet distant, pruned and kept\r\nin easy manner, they make a fine appearance and produce good fruit.\"\r\nW.C. Drury, highly regarded as a modern English authority, writing in\r\n1900 says: \"For the private garden or for market purposes the dwarf, or\r\nbush, apple tree is one of the best and most profitable forms that can\r\nbe planted.\" He also says: \"The bush is one of the best forms of all, as\r\nit is of a pleasing shape and as a rule bears good and regular crops.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clausen: Don't you have trouble with the mice?\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: No, sir, have never seen any.\r\n\r\nMr. Clausen: I had an experience a few years ago. My neighbor made a\r\nmistake; he was hauling straw around his apple trees, and he happened to\r\ntake one row of mine. We had no fence between us--and he laid the straw\r\naround the trees. I found when I came to examine these trees in the\r\nspring they were all girdled around the bottom. I am afraid to mulch.\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: I never have taken any chances. Ever troubled with the mice\r\nat your place, Mr. Weld?\r\n\r\nMr. Weld: A little.\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: I have never had any trouble with the mice. I always put on\r\na lot of old screen that I take from the cottages that is worn out and\r\nput a wire around it so the mice can't get through it. We must protect\r\nfrom mice and rabbits.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: How soon do your dwarf trees pay for themselves?\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: I don't know. I reckon these four have paid about twelve\r\nper cent. on fifteen or twenty dollars this year, and they have right\r\nalong. They have paid me better so far during the eight years than the\r\nstandards. That might not apply in eight more years, but for a city lot,\r\na man who has fifty square feet, how many apple trees could he put in\r\nthat seventeen feet apart? Nine standard trees. In that same plot of\r\nfifty feet square he could put in sixty-four dwarfs, and it would be a\r\nnice little orchard. I think it is more adapted to the city man. The\r\nordinary farmer would neglect them, and I should hate to see a farmer\r\nget them, but I would like to do anything for the man living in the city\r\nwith only a small plat of land--my vocation being in the city, my\r\navocation being in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Are those honest representations of the different apples\r\nfrom the dwarf and the standard?\r\n\r\nDr. Heustis: I don't know. Those are a fair sample of those I found in a\r\nbox on exhibit and are Red McIntosh. They are better colored than mine,\r\nmost of them are like this (indicating). I find the Yellow Transparent\r\nthat I have budded on the standard better on the dwarf than on the\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Does it blight any?\r\n\r\nDr. Huestis: No blight; there hasn't ever been a blight. I think that is\r\none reason why I feel I could recommend them quite conscientiously.\r\nOther trees have blighted when the conditions were favorable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FIVE BY SEVENTY FOOT PLOT WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH VEGETABLES FOR\r\nA SMALL FAMILY.--Even the smallest back yard may be made to yield a\r\nsupply of fresh vegetables for the family table at but slight expense if\r\ntwo or three crops are successively grown to keep the area occupied all\r\nthe time, according to the garden specialists of the department. People\r\nwho would discharge a clerk if he did not work the year round will often\r\ncultivate a garden at no little trouble and expense and then allow the\r\nsoil to lie idle from the time the first crop matures until the end of\r\nthe season. Where a two or three crop system is used in connection with\r\nvegetables adapted to small areas, a space no larger than twenty-five by\r\nseventy feet will produce enough fresh vegetables for a small family.\r\nCorn, melons, cucumbers, and potatoes and other crops which require a\r\nlarge area should not be grown in a garden of this size. Half an acre\r\nproperly cultivated with a careful crop rotation may easily produce $100\r\nworth of various garden crops in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlums That We Already Have and Plums That Are on the Way.\r\n\r\n_The Brown Rot (Monilia) a Controlling Factor._\r\n\r\nDEWAIN COOK, FRUIT GROWER, JEFFERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term \"plums we already have\" for the purpose of this paper we\r\nshall include only those varieties that have given general satisfaction\r\nover a large territory and for long term of years, and in the writer's\r\nopinion every one of such varieties are of full blooded, pure Americana\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe DeSoto takes the lead of them all. It undoubtedly has more good\r\npoints to its credit than any other plum we have ever grown. The Wyant\r\nand the freestone Wolf are considered as being the next two most popular\r\nvarieties. These were all wild varieties, found growing in the woods of\r\nWisconsin and Iowa many years ago.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other Americana varieties that are nearly as good as are\r\nsome of those enumerated, but at present we shall not attempt to name\r\nthem. There are many otherwise fine varieties that are not included in\r\nthis list of plums we already have, but because of a certain weakness of\r\nthe blossom they require to be intermingled with other varieties, or the\r\nblossoms do not fertilize properly. They only bear well when conditions\r\nare very favorable. We class such varieties as being not productive\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nMany attempts, with more or less--generally less--success have been made\r\nto improve our native plums through the growing of seedlings. Mr. H.A.\r\nTerry, of Crescent, Iowa, has done more of such work in his day than any\r\nother one man. His method was to plant the Americana kinds, like the\r\nDeSoto, alongside of varieties of the Hortulana type, like the Miner,\r\nthen growing seedlings from the best plums thus grown. From such cross\r\nbred seedlings Mr. Terry originated and introduced a great many very\r\nfine varieties. But where are they today? The Hawkeye and the Terry are\r\nabout the only ones the general public knows very much about. I will\r\nventure this statement, that as far as I know there is no variety of\r\nnative plum in which there is an intermingling of Hortulana or Chickasaw\r\ntype that has proven productive enough to be generally profitable.\r\n\r\nThe Surprise plum belongs to this type, as also does the Terry plum. The\r\nTerry plum we want to keep a while longer, not because it is a mortgage\r\nlifter for the growers but because of the extraordinarily large size of\r\nits fruit, as well as for its fine quality.\r\n\r\nThere are many injurious insects and fungous diseases that tend to make\r\nlife a burden to the man who tries to grow plums in a commercial way.\r\nAmong the insects are the plum curculio and the plum tree borer, better\r\nknown as the peach tree borer. The curculio sometimes destroys all of\r\nthe fruit on the tree, and the borer very often will destroy the whole\r\ntree of any variety.\r\n\r\nAmong the fungous diseases are the shot hole fungus and the plum pocket\r\nfungus, but the worst of all is that terribly destructive disease of the\r\nplum known as the brown rot. This brown rot fungus sometimes destroys\r\nthe whole crop of certain varieties, besides injuring the trees\r\nsometimes as well. This one disease has done more to make plum growing\r\nunpopular than all other causes combined. Give us a cheap and efficient\r\nremedy, one that will destroy the rot fungus and not do injury to the\r\nfoliage, buds or tree, and a long stride will have been made towards\r\nmaking plum growing popular as well as profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Japanese hybrid plums._--Just now the Japanese hybrid varieties are\r\nattracting considerable attention. One prominent Minnetonka fruit grower\r\nsaid this to me about them:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cook, what is the use of making all of this fuss about these new\r\nplums? Plums are only used for the purposes of making jelly anyway, and\r\nwe can usually get a dollar a bushel for our plums, and they would not\r\npay any more than that, no matter how large and fine they are.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought me up with a jerk, and I have concluded that no matter how\r\nadvanced a place in horticulture these new hybrid plums may eventually\r\ntake, that there will always be a place for our native varieties, even\r\nif only for the purpose of making jelly.\r\n\r\nIt seems to the writer that in view of the fact that after many years'\r\nattempt to improve our native plum through the process of seed\r\nselection--and we have made no material advancement in that line--that\r\nthe varieties of plums that are on the way must almost of necessity be\r\nthe product of the Americana and some of the foreign varieties of plums.\r\n\r\nMr. Theo. Williams, of Nebraska, a few years ago originated a great many\r\nvarieties of these hybrid plums. He claimed to have upward of 5,000 of\r\nthem growing at one time. Only a few of them, however, were ever sent\r\nout. Of these the writer has been growing for quite a number of years\r\nthe Eureka, Emerald, Stella, Omaha, B.A.Q. and some others. As a class\r\nthey are all reasonably hardy for my section. They grow rapidly, bear\r\nearly, usually the season after they are planted or the top grafts set.\r\nThey set fruit more freely and with greater regularity, as the seasons\r\ncome, than do the best of our native varieties. The fruit is of larger\r\nsize and of firmer flesh, while the quality of some of them, like the\r\nB.A.Q., ranks rather low. The quality of others of them, like the\r\nEmerald, is almost beyond comparison.\r\n\r\nOne year ago in answer to a question by the writer as to why the people\r\nof Iowa did not take more interest in the planting of these hybrid plums\r\nof Mr. Williams, Mr. C.G. Patten stated that it was because the plums\r\nrotted so badly on the trees. Now, Mr. Patten stated the situation\r\nexactly--most of these fine varieties are notoriously bad rotters. The\r\nbrown rot seems to be a disease of moist climate. Nature's remedy is an\r\nabundance of sunshine and a dry atmosphere, but we cannot regulate the\r\nclimate. Prof. Hansen has sent out a few varieties of these Japanese\r\nAmericana hybrid plums, and our Supt. Haralson is doing a great work\r\nalong this line. We can only hope--but cannot expect--that Mr. Hansen's\r\nhybrids or Mr. Haralson's hybrids as a class will prove more resistant\r\nto the brown rot than do those of Mr. Williams of the same class.\r\n\r\nWe have hopes that from some of Mr. C.G. Patten's hybrids of the\r\nAmericana and Domestica plum will come some varieties worthy of general\r\nplanting, and also of Prof. Hansen's crosses of the Americana plum and\r\nthe Chinese apricots.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of hybrid plums that are something wonderful in\r\ntheir way, beginning to bear nearly as soon as they are planted, the\r\nvery earliest of all plums to ripen its fruit, immensely productive and\r\nof finest quality. I refer to Prof. Hansen's sand cherry hybrid plums.\r\nMy opinion is that Prof. Hansen has done all that man can do in the way\r\nof producing elegant varieties of this class of fruit. But there is the\r\nuncertainty, however, or perhaps I had better say the certainty, that\r\nthe brown rot will take a good portion of the crop nearly every\r\nseason--sometimes only a part of the crop, and other seasons it may take\r\nthe entire crop of these fine sand cherry hybrid plums.\r\n\r\nBordeaux mixture has been the one remedy advertised for years for the\r\ncontrol of this disease, and however well it may work in the hands of\r\nexperts of the various university farms, it has not proved uniformly\r\nsuccessful in the hands of the ordinary fruit grower.\r\n\r\nNow, if some medicine should be invented, or some magic made, whereby\r\nthe brown rot would be banished from our orchards then a great many of\r\nthe fine varieties of hybrid plums would be transferred from the \"plums\r\nthat are on the way\" to the list of \"plums that we already have.\" The\r\nbrown rot is a controlling factor.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What do you know about the Surprise?\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: Oh, I know a little more than I want to know about it. I have\r\nhad the Surprise a good many years.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: You have been surprised with it?\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: Yes, sir, I have been surprised quite a bit, but in the last\r\ntwo years since the plum crop failed there have been a few plums on the\r\nSurprise trees, but for a great many years when other plums bore heavily\r\nwe got nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Hansen: Do you know of any plum that has never had brown rot?\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: In my paper--as they only allowed me fifteen minutes I had to\r\ncut it short, and I didn't say very much about the brown rot. All the\r\nAmericana plums, and all varieties of plums I have ever grown, have in\r\nsome way been susceptible to the brown rot, but some have been more\r\nresistant than others. Now, that is one reason, I believe, why the\r\nDeSoto takes the lead. It is less subject to the brown rot. We have here\r\na moist climate, and sunshine and dry atmosphere is the remedy, but some\r\nof these varieties have such a peculiar skin it is resistant to brown\r\nrot, and it seems certain, I don't know, if it is not on account of the\r\nthick skin. The Wolf has a thick skin and is subject to brown rot, but\r\nthe DeSoto is not subject to that so much but more subject to the\r\ncurculio. The Japanese hybrid plums, Mr. Williams said at one time--I\r\nsaw in one of the reports--that he had Japanese plums enough to grow\r\nfifty bushels of plums, but he generally only got a grape basket full.\r\nHe didn't think very much of them. In these sand cherry hybrids, I think\r\nMr. Hansen has done all that man could do.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: What is the difference between the brown rot and the plum\r\npocket fungus?\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: Professor Stakman will tell you that in a later paper, but it\r\nis an entirely different disease. The brown rot will work the season\r\nthrough. It will commence on some varieties and work on the small plums\r\nand work on the plums half-grown and on the full-grown. The plum pocket\r\nfungus, it works on the plums in the spring of the year and sometimes\r\ntakes the whole crop. The Terry plum, I think, a year ago, it took the\r\nwhole crop.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What is the best spray you know of, how often do you apply\r\nit and when?\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: Which is that for, for the brown rot?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Yes, for the plum generally.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: Oh, I don't know of any. Let me tell you something, the plum\r\nas a class is very susceptible to injury from sprays. I know when\r\nProfessor Luger was entomologist there was some talk of spraying plums\r\nfor curculio, and some tried it, and while it generally got the curculio\r\nit killed the trees, and Professor Luger said that the foliage of the\r\nplum was the more susceptible to injury from arsenical poisoning than\r\nthat of any other fruit in Minnesota. The Japanese hybrid plums, I\r\nthink, will take injury a little bit quicker than the native, and when\r\nyou come to the sand cherry plums it is extremely dangerous to spray\r\nwith anything stronger than rain water.\r\n\r\nProf. Hansen: I want to talk about the lime-sulphur. We will probably\r\nhave that in the next paper, only I want to say that seems to have taken\r\nthe place of the Bordeaux mixture. Brown rot, that is something that\r\naffects the peach men too. In the state of Ohio in one year the peach\r\nmen lost a quarter of a million dollars from the brown rot, the same rot\r\nthat takes our plums. We are not the only ones that suffer from the\r\nbrown rot. Well, they kept on raising peaches because they learned to\r\ncontrol it, and if you are not going to spray I think you better give\r\nup. As to trying to get something that won't take the rot, it is\r\nsomething like getting a dog that won't take the fleas. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Older: I had considerable experience in putting out seedling plums.\r\nWhen large enough to get to bearing there wasn't a good one in the whole\r\nlot. I got some plums, the finest I could pick out, and three years ago\r\nthey first came into bearing, and one of my neighbors went over there\r\nwhen they were ripe and said they were the best plums he had seen, but\r\nsince then I have had none. I got some Emerald plums from Mr. Cook. They\r\nwere nice plums, and when he came to see them he said, \"I came to see\r\nplums, I didn't come to see apples,\" but the brown rot gets a good many\r\nof them. I had some last year, and just before they ripened the brown\r\nrot struck them, and it not only took all the fruit but got the small\r\nbranches as well. I don't know what to do about the brown rot.\r\n\r\nMr. Drum: I would say that my experience was something like Mr. Older's\r\nwith the sand cherry crosses. They grew until they were large and I\r\nsprayed them with lime-sulphur. I couldn't see any injury from that\r\nuntil they were grown, nearly ripe, and then in spite of me in a single\r\nday they would turn and would mummy on the trees. I had a Hanska and\r\nOpata and the other crosses, and they bore well. They were right close\r\nto them, and the brown rot didn't affect them particularly.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I would like to ask these experts what is the life of a plum\r\ntree. Now, an apple tree, we have them that have been bearing for forty\r\nyears, but my plum trees that were put out less than twenty years ago,\r\nthey got to be a thicket and they don't bear any large plums at all. I\r\nintroduced years ago, if you remember, the Ocheeda plum, that come from\r\nseedlings that we found in the wild plum at Ocheeda Lake. It is a very\r\nfine plum. I had about twelve bushels this year, and I have never seen a\r\nbit of brown rot in that variety of plums, although the other varieties,\r\nif they bore at all, they were brown rotted all over. The Ocheeda plum\r\nhas a very thin skin, and when the rain comes at the right time and the\r\nsun comes out they all split open. That is its fault. But my orchard is\r\ngetting old; it is twenty years old. I had a young man work for me, and\r\nhe left me and bought a new place. I told him he could take up all the\r\nsprouts he wanted of those Ocheeda plums. He did so and put out an\r\norchard of them. I think that was about ten years ago. This year while\r\nmy plums didn't average me, my Ocheedas didn't average, over an inch or\r\nan inch and an eighth in diameter from that old orchard--he had sold out\r\nand gone to California--but from that orchard a man that never thinks of\r\ncultivating sold three wagon loads of the finest plums I ever saw.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: How large were the wagons? (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Well, the ordinary wagon box. He hauled them and sold them\r\nin town. That was from an orchard that had been left without any\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I have heard George Kellogg say you could prove anything in\r\nthe world in a horticultural meeting. I was glad to have Mr. Cook say a\r\nword in favor of the DeSoto. The first plum I ever bought was a DeSoto\r\nthirty-five years ago. I planted it and never saw any brown rot on it\r\nand had five bushels on it this year. George Kellogg saw it; I can prove\r\nanything by him. (Laughter.) Talking about Prof. Hansen's sand cherry\r\ncrosses, I have a number of his trees. I have two in particular that are\r\nnice trees. My wife the last three years has selected her plums from\r\nthese trees for preserving and canning. I never saw any brown rot on\r\nthem. They are nice trees, and I propose to stick by Hansen as long as\r\nhe furnishes as good stuff as that. The locality makes a great\r\ndifference in this brown rot. Some of the smaller varieties of Prof.\r\nHansen the brown rot takes. As some one has said, it will take the plums\r\nand the twigs after the plums are gone. It may be that the locality has\r\nsomething to do with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook: A year ago I was talking with some gentlemen in the lobby of\r\nthis hotel here and among them was a gentleman from the Iowa society,\r\nand I was trying to urge and tell them about the great value of some of\r\nthose hybrid plums. Mr. Reeves said to me: \"Mr. Cook, if you were going\r\nout into the woods to live and could only take one variety of plum with\r\nyou, what variety would you take?\" If he said five or six different\r\nvarieties I would have made a different answer but he said only one\r\nvariety, and I said it would be the DeSoto, and his answer was, \"So\r\nwould any other man that has right senses about him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: It was my pleasure some time ago, I think it was in 1896,\r\nto set out a few plum trees, DeSotos, and those trees grew and grew\r\nuntil they bore plums, and I was very much pleased with them. It was\r\nalso my fortune about that time to sell plums that another man had\r\ngrown, such varieties as the Ocheeda, the Wolf and the Wyant. They were\r\nsuch beautiful plums, and I obtained such beautiful prices for them, I\r\nwas very much enthused over growing plums. I purchased a number of trees\r\nof that variety, but up to the present time I have never marketed a\r\nbushel of plums from any tree of that kind. The DeSotos bore plums until\r\nthey died a natural death, which was last year.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: I have one DeSoto in my orchard which is seven years old,\r\nnever had a plum on it, never had a blossom on it. What shall I do?\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: Cut it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpraying Plums for Brown Rot.\r\n\r\nPROF. E. C. STAKMAN, MINN. EXP. STATION, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brown rot of plum is without doubt one of the important limiting\r\nfactors in plum-growing in Minnesota. In seasons favorable to its\r\ndevelopment, losses of from twenty to fifty per cent. of the crop in\r\nindividual orchards are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nExperiments on the control of the disease have been carried on by the\r\nsections of \"Plant Pathology and Tree Insects and Spraying,\" of the\r\nMinnesota Experiment Station, since 1911. No accurate results could be\r\nobtained in 1912 and 1915 on account of crop failure in the orchards\r\nselected for experiment. Results are available for the years 1911, 1913\r\nand 1914.\r\n\r\nBrown rot is caused by a fungus (_Sclerotinia cinerea (Bon.) Wor._).\r\nEvery plum grower knows the signs of the disease on the fruit. Blossoms,\r\nleaves and twigs may also be affected. The diseased blossoms become\r\nbrown and dry, and fall from the tree; the diseased leaves become brown\r\nand may die. Young twigs may also be killed.\r\n\r\nInfection may occur at blossoming-time. The amount of blossom blight\r\ndepends very largely on weather conditions; in fairly warm, moist\r\nweather there is usually more than in drier weather. The same is true of\r\nthe rot on the fruit; during periods of muggy weather it may spread with\r\namazing rapidity. The rot does not usually attack the fruit until it is\r\nnearly or quite ripe, although green plums may rot, especially if they\r\nhave been injured. It is important to know that a large percentage of\r\nrotted plums have been injured by curculio. Counts have shown that in\r\nmany cases as much as eighty-five per cent. of the rot followed such\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nRotted plums should be destroyed for two reasons: (1) The spores\r\nproduced on them may live during the winter and cause infection in the\r\nspring; (2) if the mummies fall to the ground, late in April or early in\r\nMay of the second spring the cup fungus stage may develop on them. This\r\ncup fungus produces a crop of spores capable of causing infection.\r\n\r\nSpraying experiments, the summarized results of which are given here,\r\nshow that the disease can be fairly well controlled even in badly\r\naffected orchards.\r\n\r\nSome of the experiments were carried on in the orchards at University\r\nFarm and some in commercial orchards. There were from twelve to\r\nforty-five trees in each plot, and the trees on which counts were to be\r\nmade were selected before the rot appeared. The percentages given below\r\nrefer to fruit rot and do not include blossom or twig blight. The object\r\nwas to determine the times for spraying and the most effective spray\r\nmixtures. Details are for the most part omitted, and the results of\r\nvarious experiments are averaged.\r\n\r\nFor convenience the times of spraying are designated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. When buds are still dormant.\r\n2. When blossom buds begin to show pink.\r\n3. When fruit is size of a pea.\r\n4. Two weeks after third spraying.\r\n5. When fruit begins to color.\r\n\r\nIt did not pay to apply Spray 1. In the plots on which applications 1,\r\n2, 3 and 4 were made there was an average of 6.3 per cent. of rot, while\r\nin those from which Spray 1 was omitted there was an average of 6.7 per\r\ncent. rot, a difference so slight as to be negligible. Neither did Spray\r\n4 seem to pay, there being an average of 10.9 per cent. brown rot when\r\nit was applied and 11.4 per cent. when it was omitted.\r\n\r\nThe schedule finally adopted was therefore the application of Sprays 2,\r\n3, and 5. Spray 2 is necessary to prevent blossom blight, although it\r\nhas not always reduced the amount of rot on the fruit. Spray 5 is the\r\nmost important in reducing the amount of rot. In all of the experiments\r\nduring three years the average amount of rot in the sprayed plots which\r\ndid not receive Spray 5, was 10.7 per cent. On the plots which received\r\nSpray 5, with or without the other sprays, the average amount of rot was\r\n4.6 per cent., and the average on unsprayed plots was 34.8 per cent.\r\nExcellent results were sometimes obtained by applying only Spray 5,\r\nalthough this did not, of course, have any effect on blossom blight. In\r\n1913 the amount of brown rot in one plot which received only Spray 5 was\r\n3.3 per cent., while in the unsprayed plots it was 33.9 per cent. In\r\n1914 the amount of rot was reduced from 38.8 per cent. in unsprayed\r\nplots to 6.5 per cent. in the plots to which Spray 5 was applied.\r\nPossibly Spray 3 could be omitted without seriously interfering with\r\nresults; success in controlling the rot with Spray 5 alone seems to\r\nindicate this. It was hoped to settle the matter during the past summer,\r\nbut spring frosts spoiled the experiment.\r\n\r\nFor the present it seems advisable to recommend the application of\r\nSprays 2, 3, and 5. In the first two, two and a half pounds of arsenate\r\nof lead paste, or one and one-fourth pounds of the powder should be\r\nadded to each fifty gallons of spray mixture in order to kill the\r\ncurculio. In the plots sprayed in this way in 1911 ninety-six per cent.\r\nof the fruit was perfect, while in the unsprayed plots only 81.6 per\r\ncent. was perfect, and in 1913 and 1914 the amount of brown rot was\r\nreduced from 34.8 per cent. to 4.6 per cent. Several growers have\r\nreported excellent results from these three applications, and there is\r\nno reason why other growers should not duplicate them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brown rot of plums showing the small, grayish brown tufts\r\nof spores. Can be controlled by destroying mummies and thorough\r\nspraying.]\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of various fungicides was tried. Self-boiled\r\nlime-sulphur, 8-8-50; commercial lime-sulphur, 1 to 40; 2-4-50 and\r\n3-4-50 Bordeaux; iron sulphide made up with 1 to 40 commercial\r\nlime-sulphur, and iron sulphide made up with 10-10-50 self-boiled\r\nlime-sulphur were tried and all gave good results. Commercial\r\nlime-sulphur, 1 to 40, has been used in commercial orchards with\r\nexcellent results, and it will probably be used more than the other\r\nspray mixtures because it is so easy to use. Possibly weaker solutions\r\nof lime-sulphur would do just as well as 1 to 40. This will be\r\ndetermined, if possible, during the summer of 1916.\r\n\r\nGood results were obtained only when a high pressure was maintained in\r\nspraying. There was a clearly observable difference between plots\r\nsprayed with low pressure and those sprayed with a pressure of more than\r\n175 pounds. For large orchards a power sprayer is desirable; for small\r\norchards a barrel sprayer with an air-pressure tank attached is large\r\nenough. Such an outfit can be bought for $35 or $40 and can do good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe cost of spraying three times should not exceed fifteen cents a tree.\r\nThe results from spraying orchards which contain a great deal of brown\r\nrot and have never before been sprayed will probably not be so good the\r\nfirst year as in better kept orchards, but by spraying regularly each\r\nseason the disease can be well controlled.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: Please state what you mean by 3-4-50 there.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: 3-4-50 Bordeaux mixture means three pounds of bluestone or\r\ncopper sulphate, four pounds of lime, and fifty gallons of water. The\r\ncopper sulphate should be dissolved in twenty-five gallons of water, the\r\nbest way being to put it into a sack and hang the sack in the water. The\r\nlime should be slaked and then enough water added to make twenty-five\r\ngallons of milk of lime. Here is where the important part of making up\r\nthe spray comes in. Two people should work together and pour the milk of\r\nlime and the bluestone solution together so that the streams mix in\r\npouring. It is very important that the mixing be thorough and the\r\nmixture should be used fresh.\r\n\r\nThe President: Do you add any Paris green at any time or arsenate of\r\nlead?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Always add arsenate of lead two times, when the buds are\r\nswelling and when the plums are the size of green peas.\r\n\r\nThe President: How much?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: I would rather leave that to Professor Ruggles. We used\r\nfrom 2-1/2 to 3 pounds and Mr. Ruggles, I think, found 2-1/2 pounds was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe President: That is, 2-1/2 pounds to 50 gallons of water with the\r\nother ingredients?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I would like to ask if you have ever used arsenate of lead for\r\nspraying plums?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: In the experiments which we conducted in co-operation with\r\nMr. Ruggles, of the Division of Entomology, we always used arsenate of\r\nlead in the first two sprayings to kill the curculio.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I had quite an experience, so I want to know what your\r\nexperience was.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: We never had any trouble with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I have had an experience of thirty years, and I have never\r\nseen or had on my place any brown rot, and I never was troubled with any\r\ncurculio, and I practically always used arsenate of lead.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: Isn't it a fact if you begin spraying your plum trees when\r\nthey are young and spray them early, at the right time, you have very\r\nlittle trouble with the brown rot? And spray them every year?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Yes, that is it. You might be disappointed the first year\r\nif the orchard had never been sprayed, but by spraying year after year\r\nyou finally cut it down.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: You said a pressure of 200 pounds ought to be used?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Yes, but it isn't necessary to get an expensive power\r\nsprayer to keep up that pressure. There are sprayers on the market that\r\ncost from $30 to $40 which have a pressure tank by which the pressure\r\ncan be maintained at from 175 to 250 pounds without any great amount of\r\ntrouble, that is, for a small orchard. If you have a big enough orchard\r\nfor a power sprayer, of course get it.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: This summer my plum trees, the leaves all turned brown\r\nand came off. What is the reason?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: When did it happen?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Along in August, I think; July or August.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: What kind of soil were they on?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Clay.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Did you spray?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Yes, sir, I sprayed.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: What did you use?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Lime-sulphur, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Did the whole leaf turn brown?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Yes, sir, the whole leaf turned brown and came off.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: How strong did you use the lime-sulphur?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Not very strong.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: If you use very strong lime-sulphur you sometimes get such\r\nan effect on both plums and apples. Sometimes the leaves fall, and\r\nalmost immediately you get a new crop of leaves.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: This was in August.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: There was a perfect crop of new leaves?\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: My only suggestion would be that you used the lime-sulphur\r\ntoo strong. That might account for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I never sprayed until this year. I tried it this year and\r\nwith good results. I sprayed my apple trees at the same time, and I\r\nsprayed the plums with the same thing I sprayed the apple trees with. I\r\nhad nice plums and nice apples; last year I had hardly any.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: What did you use?\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Lime-sulphur and some black leaf mixture. I used it on the\r\nplum trees and the apple trees, and afterwards I used arsenate of lead.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: You didn't get any injury to the plum trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: No, sir, we had nice plums.\r\n\r\nA Member: I have seventeen plum trees, and I have only sprayed with\r\nkerosene emulsion and the second time put in some Paris green, and I\r\nhave never seen any of the brown rot, but there have been a good many of\r\nthe black aphids on the plum trees, on the end of the branches. I cut\r\nthem off and burned them. I didn't know whether that would be the end of\r\nit or not.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles: Why don't you use \"black leaf 40,\" 1/2 pint in 50 gallons\r\nof the spray liquid. It can be used in combination with arsenate of lead\r\nand lime-sulphur or arsenate of lead and Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\nIf you wash them with black leaf 40 it will kill all the aphids. I did\r\nthat myself this summer.\r\n\r\nA Member: Please give us a little better explanation of what black leaf\r\n40 is.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles: It is an extract of tobacco that is for sale by wholesale\r\ndrug companies and stores, or you can get it from Kentucky, from the\r\nTobacco Products Company, at Louisville, Ky., or Grasseli Chemical Co.,\r\nSt. Paul. I am not advertising, Mr. President, but they will send you a\r\nsmall package for seventy-five cents, about half a pint. Of course, that\r\nlooks kind of expensive, but it will go a long way. I think possibly it\r\nis the best thing we have to combat lice.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Plum pocket is caused by a fungus which is supposed to\r\ninfect mostly when the flower buds are just beginning to swell,\r\nespecially in cold, wet weather. Plum pocket causes the fruit to\r\novergrow and destroys the pit, and big bladder or sack-like fruits are\r\nproduced instead of the normal fruit. The fungus that causes it gets\r\ninto the twig and is supposed to live there year after year. Therefore\r\npathologists usually recommend cutting out and burning affected branches\r\nand even trees that bear pocketed plums several seasons in succession.\r\nOur experiments with plum pocket have not extended far enough to enable\r\nme to say anything definite about it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall: With us in western Minnesota this year this plum pocket got\r\nall the plums that the frost didn't get. If we were to cut off the twigs\r\nwe would have to chop off the trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: When a tree becomes so badly infected that practically all\r\nof the branches produce pocketed plums year after year you can't expect\r\nvery much normal fruit. Sometimes you might get some, but usually not\r\nvery many.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves (Wisconsin): Do you use your black leaf 40 in conjunction\r\nwith your Bordeaux or lime-sulphur?\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles: Yes, you can.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves: Doesn't it counteract the result?\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles: No, it does not.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: I used this year lime-sulphur and black leaf 40 together.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves: You say you got the same results from black leaf 40 in that\r\nmixture?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: It killed the plant lice; that is all I wanted.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves: We had some experiences that indicated that black leaf\r\ncounteracted the other results.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Yes, sir, I think that has been the impression, but I think\r\nthere have been some experiments more recently to show that the black\r\nleaf 40 can be used in conjunction with other sprays without\r\ncounteracting their results.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Did you ever know the plum pocket to come unless we had\r\ncold weather about the time of blossoming and lots of east wind?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Yes, a little; I have seen it mostly when there was cold\r\nweather, however, and as I said before it usually isn't so serious\r\nunless there is cold, wet weather.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I settled out in Martin County, Minnesota, in 1866, and\r\nin all my experience I never saw plum pocket unless we had the right\r\nkind of cold weather at the time of the blossoming. I had my plums all\r\nkilled and destroyed one year and never did anything for it, and when we\r\nhad the right kind of weather I never had any trouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: When you have cold, wet weather, as I mentioned before,\r\ninfection takes place much more rapidly than it does at other times.\r\nThere is some evidence to show that the fungus lives in the twigs and\r\nthat affected ones should be cut out.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Yes, but these didn't bear any for four or five years,\r\nand when we got the right kind of weather I got good plums.\r\n\r\nMr. Norwood: My experience is something like this man's. I have had my\r\nplums killed off as many as five years with the plum pocket and then had\r\na good crop of plums. I sprayed with lime-sulphur.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: When did you spray?\r\n\r\nMr. Norwood: I spray just before the buds open.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: The flower or leaf?\r\n\r\nMr. Norwood: Flower, and then I spray when the plums are well started,\r\njust before they begin to ripen.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Were you spraying for the pocket or brown rot?\r\n\r\nMr. Norwood: I used lime-sulphur and arsenate of lime.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: Of course, spraying after buds open wouldn't do any good\r\nfor the plum pockets at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Norwood: I spray mainly for the brown rot, and I have pretty good\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: Have you had any experience in using orchard heaters to\r\nsave plums in cold nights?\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: I will ask Mr. Cady to answer that.\r\n\r\nMr. Cady: No, I haven't tried to use them.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: We tried it this year, and we saved our plum crop. We have\r\ntried it the last four years and saved our plum crop each year. We also\r\nsprayed each year and had a very good crop of plums when neighbors who\r\nhad not sprayed had very few, and I am satisfied if we use the proper\r\ningredients and spray properly at the right time, and occasionally use\r\nan orchard heater when there is any danger of freezing, that we will\r\nraise a good crop of most any plum that is hardy enough for this\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nA Member: What kind of heaters do you use?\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: We use oil heaters. We use crude oil, the same oil we use\r\nin our tractor engine.\r\n\r\nA Member: Where do you buy your heaters?\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: We have them made at the hardware store, of sheet iron,\r\nwith a cover. We put about two gallons of oil in this heater. There is a\r\nsmall piece of waste that is used as a wick, which we light from a\r\ntorch. It will heat quite a large space sufficiently for two or three\r\nhours and prevent frost.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Do you put a canvas over the tree or leave it uncovered?\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: We do not put anything over the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Stakman: What does your oil cost?\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: About eight or nine cents a gallon.\r\n\r\nProf. Hansen: Just a thought occurred to me that out west on the Pacific\r\ncoast where men have to get down to business in order to raise fruit\r\nthey have these horticultural commissioners that have absolute police\r\npower to make orchard men clean up. They will come into your old orchard\r\nand pull it up and burn it and add it to your taxes, charge it up to\r\nyou, if you don't clean up. The same sort of police power should prevail\r\nhere. If a man has an old plum orchard that is diseased through and\r\nthrough, it won't do for him to tell his tale of woe year after year and\r\nnot do anything. A county agent will come along and clean it up for him.\r\nAfter it is cleaned up it will be an easier proposition. If you are not\r\ngoing to keep up with the times and spray, then the county agent ought\r\nto have police power to burn the orchard. Either spray or go out of the\r\nplum business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MAKE CONCENTRATED APPLE CIDER ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE.--The\r\nspecialists of the fruit and vegetable utilization laboratory of the\r\ndepartment have completed arrangements for a commercial test of the\r\nrecently discovered method of concentrating apple cider by freezing and\r\ncentrifugal methods. As a result, a cider mill in the Hood River Valley,\r\nOre., will this fall undertake to manufacture and put on the retail\r\nmarket 1,000 gallons of concentrated cider, which will represent 5,000\r\ngallons of ordinary apple cider with only the water removed.\r\n\r\nThe new method, it is believed, makes possible the concentrating of\r\ncider in such a way that it will keep better than raw cider, and also be\r\nso reduced in bulk that it can be shipped profitably long distances from\r\nthe apple growing regions. The old attempts to concentrate cider by\r\nboiling have been failures because heat destroys the delicate flavor of\r\ncider. Under the new method nothing is taken from the cider but the\r\nwater, and the resultant product is a thick liquid which contains all\r\nthe apple-juice products and which can be restored to excellent sweet\r\ncider by the simple addition of four parts of water. The shippers and\r\nconsumers, therefore, avoid paying freight on the water in ordinary\r\ncider. In addition, the product, when properly barreled, because of its\r\nhigher amount of sugar, keeps better than raw cider, which quickly turns\r\nto vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe process, as described by the department's specialists, consists of\r\nfreezing ordinary cider solid. The cider ice is then crushed and put\r\ninto centrifugal machines such as are used in making cane sugar. When\r\nthe cider ice is whirled rapidly the concentrated juice is thrown off\r\nand collected. The water remains in the machine as ice.\r\n\r\nAt ordinary household refrigerator temperatures this syrup-like cider\r\nwill keep perfectly for a month or six weeks, and if kept at low\r\ntemperatures in cold storage will keep for prolonged periods. At\r\nordinary house temperatures it, of course, will keep a shorter time.\r\n\r\nTo make the concentrated syrup, the cider mill must add to its equipment\r\nan ice-making machine and centrifugal machinery, so that the process is\r\nnot practicable on a small scale. The specialists are hopeful, however,\r\nthat the commercial test soon to be inaugurated in Oregon will show that\r\nit will be possible for apple growers to concentrate their excess cider\r\nand ship it profitably to the far South or to other non-producing\r\nregions. The specialists also believe that it will enable apple\r\nproducers to prolong the market for cider.--U.S. Dept. of Agri., Oct.,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Mansfield Grows Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMRS. JENNIE STAGER, SAUK RAPIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhere around 1870 Mr. Wm. Mansfield, of Johnsons Creek, Wis.,\r\ncommenced to apply what Gov. Hoard, of Wisconsin, told him was\r\n\"persevering intelligence,\" to the propagating and improving of the\r\ntomato, and he soon found out that the tomato was capable of almost\r\nunlimited improvement. He has made a specialty of the tree tomato, of\r\nwhich he says he has demonstrated to the world that in the Mansfield\r\ntree tomato he has produced one of the greatest wonders of the age. All\r\nwho have seen them, tasted or grown them, with even a small degree of\r\ngood sense, are loud in their praise for their good qualities: wonderful\r\ngrowth of tree, beauty of fruit, smoothness, solidity, flavor,\r\nearliness, etc.\r\n\r\nIn giving directions how to grow them he says you should remember that\r\nif your brightest child is raised among Indians he is not likely to\r\nbecome president. Neither will the tree tomato if thrown on a brush\r\npile, or just stuck in a poor, dry place and left to care for itself, be\r\nready to jump on your table, on the Fourth of July, or any other month,\r\na ripe, delicious, two-pound tomato.\r\n\r\nHe says first get your seed of some reliable person, who can warrant it\r\npure and all right. Then at the proper time, which in this climate would\r\nbe some time in March, get some rich old earth for boxes in your house,\r\nhotbeds or greenhouse. Sow the seed, cover lightly, wet down every day\r\nand keep warm, with all the sun possible. When up ten days transplant to\r\nother boxes, six inches apart, and not less than four inches deep. Keep\r\nwet and give all the light and sun you can, and by the time it is safe\r\nto set them outside they should stand from twelve to twenty-four inches\r\nin height, with bodies half an inch thick.\r\n\r\n_To prepare the ground._--First select a place as near water as\r\npossible, and also, if you can, let your rows run east and west. Throw\r\nout dirt two spades deep, then put in three or four inches of night soil\r\nif you can get it, if not use hen manure and wood ashes, equal parts, or\r\nsome other strong manure, in the bottom of trench. Then fill up the\r\ntrench with the best dirt you can get, mixed with well rotted stable\r\nmanure, as no fresh manure must come near the roots or bark to rot them.\r\n\r\nNow set out your plants without disturbing the dirt about the roots. Set\r\neighteen inches apart in the row and have the dirt in the trenches a\r\nlittle lower than at the sides. Place a strong stake at each plant or a\r\ntrellis and tie them to it as fast as set. Then if it does not rain use\r\nhard, soft, cold or warm water and give plenty each day. As your plants\r\ncommence to grow, just above each leaf will start a shoot. Let only the\r\ntop of the plant, and only one or two of the best branches grow, so as\r\nto have not over one or two of the best stems to run up. Now the buds\r\nfor blossoms show themselves on the tops of the vines, and a few inches\r\nbelow. Just above each leaf, a shoot starts; nip off every one of these\r\njust as soon as they appear. As the lower leaves get brown and old pick\r\nthem off. Train the fruit as it grows to the sun. Tie often and well.\r\nLet no useless wood grow. Give all the sun possible and water, water and\r\nthen water. Then you can take the cake on tomatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. Mansfield and his big tomatoes, Casselton, N.D.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield's record twenty-six years ago, at Johnsons Creek, Wis.,\r\nwas: Height of tomato tree, eleven feet. Weight of single tomato, two\r\npounds six ounces. He says, since he has moved to North Dakota, his\r\ntomato has in no wise deteriorated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Central Trial Station.\r\n\r\nPROFS. LE ROY CADY AND R. WELLINGTON, UNIVERSITY FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the coming of Prof. Wellington to the Station to take up the\r\npomological and vegetable divisions the work of this Station, has been\r\ndivided, Prof. Wellington taking the fruit and vegetable experimental\r\nwork, while Prof. Cady continues the work in ornamentals, and on that\r\nbasis the reports will be made this year.\r\n\r\n_Ornamentals._--The campus of University Farm has been very much\r\nenlarged this year by the building of the Gymnasium, and consequent\r\nparking about it, and the grading of an athletic field. This will call\r\nfor considerable planting work next spring.\r\n\r\nThe season has been exceptionally good for the growth of all ornamental\r\nstock. All came through last winter in good shape. A late frost killed\r\nmany of the early flowering plants, and this prevented the forming of\r\nfruit on such plants as barberry and wahoo. About 400 seedling paeonies\r\nflowered again this year. Some of these are promising. An excellent\r\nblock of aquilegia was flowered. A trial ground of some hundred or more\r\nannuals was maintained and proved very interesting. It is hoped that\r\nmany more annual novelties may be tried out this year. The perennial\r\ngarden established last year was added to and furnished something of\r\ninterest the whole season. It will be the aim of the Division to have in\r\nthis garden all the annuals and perennials of value in this section.\r\nSome new shrubs were added by purchase and through the Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry. The hedges have proved an interesting exhibit again this year,\r\nand it is planned to add a number of new ones to the group next season.\r\nAbout seventy-five varieties of chrysanthemums were flowered this autumn\r\nand were much enjoyed by our visitors.\r\n\r\n_Fruit._--This year has been a very poor fruit year owing to the freeze\r\non May 18, when the thermometer dropped to 26 degrees Fahrenheit. At\r\nthat time a very promising crop of apples was frozen on the trees.\r\nCurrants and gooseberries were also frozen on the bushes, and the young\r\nshoots were frozen on the grape vines. Later the grape vines sent out\r\nsecondary shoots which bore a small crop of late maturing fruit.\r\nRegardless of the heavy freeze an apple was found here and there\r\nthroughout the orchard, although no one variety seemed to be\r\nparticularly favored. On one-year-old Compass and Dyehouse cherry trees\r\na few fruits were borne, and a similar amount of fruit was produced on\r\none-year-old Sapa and Skuya plums. The old plum seedling orchard, which\r\nis located to the south of the college buildings and is partially\r\nprotected by a wooded hill to the north, gave about five per cent of a\r\ncrop. The one-year-old raspberries and blackberries bore a small crop,\r\nand the new strawberry bed, containing over 150 varieties, yielded a\r\ngood crop. Records were made on the blossoming dates of practically all\r\nthe varieties grown at the Station, and complete descriptions were made\r\nof all the strawberry flowers, fruits and plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Class in propagation at work at Minnesota State\r\nAgricultural College.]\r\n\r\nPlants were taken from the strawberry bed and used for setting out a new\r\nbed, which is located on level and uniform ground. By another year\r\nsufficient data should be at hand to report on the performance of the\r\nvarieties tested.\r\n\r\nThe aphids were very numerous and unfortunately caused the defoliation\r\nof all the currants with the exception of the blacks. A new sidewalk\r\nthrough the currant patch necessitated the transplanting of about\r\none-half of the varieties, and so the prospect for a good currant crop\r\nnext season is poor. The mildew attacked the Poorman gooseberry very\r\nseverely but did practically no damage to the native varieties, as the\r\nCarrie and Houghton. Blight was a negligible factor, and what little\r\nappeared was removed as soon as noted. This year's rest, especially as\r\nit has been coupled with a good growing season, should be very favorable\r\nfor an abundant crop in 1916.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the varieties at the Trial Station, it is of interest to\r\nnote that the following number are under observation: 235 apple, 1\r\napricot, 15 cherry, 3 peach, 6 pear, 70 plum, 23 blackberry, 3 dewberry,\r\n14 red currant, 3 black currant, 2 white currant, 13 gooseberry, 26\r\ngrape, 4 black raspberry, 22 red raspberry, 1 purple raspberry and 157\r\nstrawberry.\r\n\r\n_Vegetables._--The vegetable work has been concentrated on the bean,\r\ncucumber, lettuce, pea, onion, potato and tomato. The chief work with\r\nthe bean and pea has been to isolate desirable canning types from the\r\npresent varieties. Selection has also been carried on with the lettuce,\r\nwith the object of securing a head type which matures uniformly. Onion\r\nbulbs of various types have self-fertilized, and desirable fixed strains\r\nwill be separated if possible. Incidentally, the inheritance of various\r\ntypes and colors of the onion is under observation. In the tomato the\r\ninfluence of crossing on yield and earliness has been studied. Increases\r\nnearly as high as five tons have been obtained, and the prospects are\r\nvery bright for securing valuable combinations for gardeners who use\r\ngreenhouses and high-priced land. Results of this work will probably\r\nsoon be published in a station bulletin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chrysanthemums in flower in University Farm\r\ngreenhouses.]\r\n\r\nA better type of greenhouse cucumber is being sought by combining the\r\nEuropean and White Spine varieties. From past experience the author\r\nknows that a uniform type that is well adapted to market purposes can be\r\nobtained, and the only question will be its productiveness.\r\nUnfortunately hybridizing was not performed early enough in the season,\r\nand disease prevented the making of crosses. This coming season the work\r\nwill be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe main work of the year has been on the potato, and the chief problem\r\nhas been on the determination of the cause of degeneracy. Incidentally,\r\nmany varieties have been tested, and the exchange of seed with the Grand\r\nRapids, Crookston and Duluth stations has been started. If possible, the\r\neffect of varying climatic and soil conditions on the potato will be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nA few vegetable varieties have been tested and among them the Reading\r\nGiant, a rust-proof asparagus, has proved promising. Malcolm, the\r\nearliest Canadian sweet corn, ripened very early and will be tested\r\nfurther. Washington, a late sweet corn ripening between Crosby and\r\nEvergreen, made an exceptionally good showing and may prove of much\r\nvalue for market purposes. The Alacrity tomato was found to be similar\r\nto the Earliana and superior in no way. Bonny Best and John Baer\r\ntomatoes produced smooth, desirable fruit and are deserving of a wide\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nThe much advertised \"seed tape\" was given a trial, and it proved\r\nsatisfactory in most cases. For kitchen gardeners who are ignorant of\r\nplanting distances, methods of planting and varieties, and who can\r\nafford to pay a higher price for their seed, the tape may prove of\r\nvalue, that is, if a high grade of seed is maintained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA CORRECTION.--In O. W. Moore's interesting article on\r\n\"Sexuality in Plants,\" which appeared in the November (1915) number of\r\nThe Horticulturist, two errors were present. The first is merely\r\ntypographical, as Kaelreuter's name, page 411, should be spelled\r\nKolreuter. The second, however, is misleading, as it states that the\r\nprocess of fertilization is called \"Mendel's Law.\" It is true that\r\nMendel's Law is based upon fertilization, but it concerns simply the\r\nsplitting up of certain characters into definite mathematical\r\nproportions. For example, Mendel found that when he crossed a yellow and\r\ngreen pea the first generation produced only yellow peas. These peas\r\nwhen self-fertilized split up into practically three yellows to one\r\ngreen. By self-fertilizing the progeny of the second generation it was\r\nfound that one-third of the yellows bred true for yellow, and two-thirds\r\nof the yellows broke up into yellow and green, showing that they were in\r\na heterozygous condition, and that all the greens bred true for green.\r\nAt the present time this method of segregation has been proved to hold\r\nfor many easily differentiated characters in both the animal and plant\r\nkingdom, but much more experimental work will have to be done before it\r\ncan be said to hold for all inheritable characters.--Prof. Richard\r\nWellington, University Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Culture.\r\n\r\nMARTIN FRYDHOLM, ALBERT LEA, MINN.\r\n\r\n(Annual Meeting, 1916, So. Minn. Hort. Society.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRose culture is one of the most fascinating occupations in the line of\r\nhorticulture. But when you come to talking or writing about it you\r\nscarcely know where to begin or what to say, there passes before your\r\neye an exhibition of such an amazing fragrance and beauty of varying\r\ncolors. Even now as I am writing these lines I can see with my mind's\r\neye every rose in my garden, some in their full glory, filling the air\r\nwith the sweet fragrance; others just opening; others in bud; and so on\r\nin an ever pleasing variety. I have taken special interest in roses for\r\nsome ten or twelve years and have grown a good many different varieties\r\nof them with success, good, bad and indifferent. I have succeeded well\r\nwith some of the hybrid perpetual roses. At the present time I have in\r\nmy garden Paul Neyron, General Jacquiminot, Ulric Brunner, Black Prince,\r\nEtoile De France, Frau Karl Droschky and Marshall P. Wilder, also others\r\nof which I have lost the names. Of climbing roses I have Crimson\r\nRambler, Thousand Beauties, Prairie Queen and Dorothy Perkins. All the\r\nabove named are everbloomers, except the climbers, and all need careful\r\nwinter protection.\r\n\r\n_How to grow them._--Get two year old No. 1 plants and prepare your soil\r\njust like you would for your vegetable garden. If your soil is not\r\nparticularly rich, spade in a liberal quantity of well rotted manure and\r\nmix well with soil. Set your plants and keep up clean cultivation all\r\nsummer and give them plenty of water, and you will have an abundance of\r\nroses the first year. In the fall get some clean straw, bend your rose\r\nbushes over, put a fence post across on top of them to hold them down\r\nand then cover with straw to a depth of one foot. Or if you have a\r\nnumber of them planted in one row, make a long box about two feet wide\r\nand about twenty inches deep, fill about half full of straw, then place\r\nalong side of the row of plants, bend your plants down lengthwise the\r\nrow, then tip the box over them, put some straw around sides of box and\r\non the outside put some posts or boards on to hold it down, when you\r\nwill have the best protection possible. Right here I want to put in a\r\nword of warning, and that is, if you do not like to do extra work don't\r\nattempt to grow roses; in other words, if you are lazy they don't like\r\nyou well enough to stay with you, for it means work and lots of it.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, one class of roses which can be grown by every one who\r\nwants them, the hybrid Rosa Rugosa roses. Of them we have such as\r\nBlanche D. Caubet, pure white of large size, a perpetual bloomer; Sir\r\nThomas Lipton, also white, a little smaller in blossom but perfectly\r\ndouble; Conrad Meyer, clear silvery pink, of large size, very double and\r\nof choicest fragrance, a continuous bloomer (needs some winter\r\nprotection); New Century, rosy pink, shading to almost red in the\r\ncenter, good size and double. One of the hardiest is Hansa, deep violet\r\nred, very large, double and an exceedingly profuse and continuous\r\nbloomer, absolutely hardy. These five varieties can be considered as\r\neverybody's roses, because of the easiness and sureness with which they\r\ncan be grown, taking into consideration the elimination of winter\r\nprotection. Planting, preparation of ground and cultivation are the same\r\nas for all other roses. Do not imagine for a minute that they will do\r\nwell in sod or grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martin Frydholm in his rose garden, at Albert Lea.]\r\n\r\nAnother class of roses is the Baby Ramblers. For borders and bedding\r\nroses these I think surpass all others on account of the easiness by\r\nwhich they may be grown. And they are a perfect mass of blossoms from\r\nJune till freezing. They need winter protection, but that is not\r\ndifficult on account of the low growth and small size of plant.\r\n\r\nAbove all do not forget that all roses need rich soil and lots of water.\r\nWhen your rose bushes are three years old you must begin to give some\r\nattention to trimming. Cut out some of the oldest wood before you lay\r\nthem down in the fall, and if some of the shoots have grown very tall\r\ncut back about half, although these rank canes may give you the best\r\nroses the following season if you can protect them well enough so that\r\nthey do not winter-kill. In this photograph which is shown here is one\r\nUlric Brunner with one shoot extending two feet above my head and\r\ncovered all along with the most magnificent roses I have ever had in my\r\ngarden. The same thing I have done with the General Jacquiminot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsparagus by the Acre.\r\n\r\nE. W. RECORD, MARKET GARDENER, BROOKLYN CENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst I am careful about selecting seed of a good variety. My choice is\r\nPalmetto, because it is hardy and the best seller on our market. In\r\nstarting a bed I sow my seed as early as possible in the spring in rows\r\nabout eighteen inches apart, and when the plants are well up I thin out\r\nto about an inch, so the roots will not be so hard to separate when\r\nready to transplant. My experience has been that plants two years old\r\nare more easily handled than those one or three, because the one year\r\nplants are not matured enough, while the roots of the three year old\r\nhave become too matured, and when separated too many of the roots are\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the ground for asparagus I plow and then harrow it and mark\r\nit off so the rows will be five feet apart. I plow a furrow from\r\nfourteen to sixteen inches deep, throwing the dirt both ways. Then with\r\nmy cultivator I loosen up the bottom of the furrow. I place the plants\r\nin the furrow about eighteen inches apart, being careful to spread the\r\nroots evenly over the bottom of the furrow, putting a little dirt over\r\nthem to hold them in place. With my cultivator I keep filling in the\r\nfurrow, at the same time plowing out the middle to keep down the weeds.\r\n\r\nIn fertilizing a bed of asparagus my experience has been that the best\r\nway is to plow a furrow between the rows, filling it with barnyard\r\nmanure, then covering this with earth. Spreading the manure broadcast\r\nmakes too many of the stalks grow crooked.\r\n\r\nI never cut my asparagus for market until the third year, and then only\r\nfor a short time. By the fifth year the bed is strong enough to cut the\r\nwhole season. When the season is over I cultivate often enough to keep\r\ndown the weeds. I never cut the old stalks off until spring, because\r\nafter the first freeze the stalks are hollow, and this would allow the\r\nfrost to run down into the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Second Congressional District.\r\n\r\nJOHN BISBEE, MADELIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA summer remarkable in many respects has passed. Many of our people have\r\nlabored hard, and the rewards of that labor have been meager and\r\nunsatisfactory. Horticulture with all the other labors on the land has\r\nbeen rewarded like the other cultivators of the soil in our section of\r\nthe state. I sent out twenty-five of the circulars and twenty were\r\nfilled out and returned.\r\n\r\nApple raisers report, four a good crop, the balance poor or none.\r\n\r\nPlums: One fair, others poor or none.\r\n\r\nCherries: One good, all others poor.\r\n\r\nGrapes: One good, balance poor to none.\r\n\r\nBlackberries: One good, balance poor to none.\r\n\r\nOther fruits all poor.\r\n\r\nNursery stock: One place reports one car load planted, the balance a\r\nfew, all making good growth.\r\n\r\nStrawberries: Five report good crop, balance few to poor.\r\n\r\nBlight: Some reported but little efforts made to eradicate.\r\n\r\nFruit trees did not suffer much last winter (1914-5). All report plenty\r\nof moisture in ground.\r\n\r\nVarieties of apples doing best: Wealthy, Duchess, Longfield, Salome,\r\nSpitzenberg, Northwestern Greening, Anisim, Malinda, Hibernal, Jonathan.\r\n\r\nSpraying neglected very largely.\r\n\r\nI am doing all of the top-working I can get done every spring.\r\n\r\nAm setting largely the Salome. I find the tree hardy here; a moderate\r\nbearer; apples fine and handsome; a good keeper; tree does not blight\r\nand grows very thriftily. It grows on a great share of the stocks in\r\nwhich I have placed it.\r\n\r\nMy next best apple is the Spitzenberg. I am not placing many Wealthy\r\nscions, as I have about all I want of them.\r\n\r\nI tried thinning the fruit on some of my heavy bearers last summer and\r\nlike it much. I think the best way to do it is to cut out the fruit\r\nspurs, as that can be done in the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Fifth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nCHAS. H. RAMSDELL, MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horticultural interests of the Fifth Congressional District (of\r\nwhich Minneapolis is the largest part) comprise three lines of activity,\r\nthe raising of fruit, vegetables and flowers for home supply and profit,\r\nornamental horticulture for pleasure and the city marketing of the\r\nproduce of this and every other region, furnishing whatever is demanded\r\nby a large metropolitan market. Therefore, I will report along these\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chas. H. Ramsdell.]\r\n\r\nJudging from the reports of my correspondents throughout the country,\r\nthe \"freeze\" in May was responsible for a rather complete absence of\r\nlocal fruit the past season. Sheltered orchards and those on the south\r\nside of any lake bore a small crop. Of apples, the Wealthy and Malinda\r\nare mentioned as bearing fairly well. Plums were entirely a failure,\r\ncherries are not raised to any extent, grapes and small fruits were not\r\nenough to supply the market as a whole. Raspberry and strawberry growing\r\nseems to be on the decline, owing to the prevalence of insect pests\r\nwhich do _not_ receive attention to keep them in check. The importance\r\nof this is all the more apparent, because with the shorter distances of\r\nthis district being the rule, the danger from rapid spread is more\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nThe growing conditions of the season have been of the best, and all\r\nstock goes into the winter in excellent shape with a good amount of soil\r\nmoisture and a promise for better conditions next season.\r\n\r\nSeveral market reports have been received which give valuable\r\ninformation. Prices of fruit, vegetables and floral stock have been low\r\nin almost all cases. The public demand has been rather below normal,\r\nalthough it has been steady and fair in volume. There seems to be a good\r\ndeal of complaint about the care of the railroads, etc., with fruit and\r\nperishable products, but, on the other hand, a good deal of local\r\nproduce is not put up in good shape. The uniformly good packing of\r\nwestern fruit reveals the cause of its popularity on the local markets.\r\nCertain kinds of fruit almost glutted the market this season, notably\r\nFlorida grape fruit, western box apples and peaches. I quote one market\r\nstatement as very pertinent:\r\n\r\nIf Minnesota apple growers would gather their apples before they are too\r\nripe, carefully grade and pack uniformly through the barrel, thus making\r\nit possible for the wholesaler to ship out on orders, they would\r\nundoubtedly realize more for their product than to market them\r\nthemselves in the usual manner in which apples are marketed.\r\n\r\nOrnamental horticulture in my district is making rapid progress. Large\r\nlots of nursery stock are yearly put in with excellent results. The\r\ninfluence and interest of the \"Garden Flower Society\" and of these\r\nhorticultural meetings is nowhere more felt than in Hennepin County. The\r\ngardens of the Minneapolis park board, in Loring Park, at Lyndale\r\nFarmstead, and near the Parade and Armory, give the horticultural public\r\nmuch valuable information. Even the wild flower garden in Glenwood Park\r\nis yearly receiving an increasing number of visitors. The increasing use\r\nof perennials is creating a new gardening enthusiasm. The perennial\r\nexhibit at the summer meeting of the Horticultural Society was worthy of\r\nmuch study. Careful use of hardy evergreens is increasing also, adding\r\nvalue especially to our winter landscapes. This season has been very\r\nfavorable to gardening work and steady has been the progress made.\r\n\r\nGreater care with insect pests, and better methods of preparing fruit\r\nfor market seem to be the two greatest needs of the horticulturists of\r\nthe Fifth District.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPPLE PRODUCTION AND PRICES.--According to the best authority\r\navailable, the apple crop in the United States for 1915 promises to be\r\nabout 22,500,000 barrels, says The Niagara County, New York, Farm Bureau\r\nNews. This will be the lightest crop in several years, the 1910 crop\r\nbeing the next lightest, when about 24,000,000 barrels were produced. In\r\ncomparison, the 1914 crop was about 45,000,000 barrels and the 1913 crop\r\nabout 30,000,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe above refers to the commercial crop that is marketed in closed\r\npackages, and should not be confounded with the recent estimate of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, which is understood to refer to\r\nthe total production of apples, including those used for cider and\r\nshipped to the market in bulk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Sixth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nE. W. MAYMAN, SAUK RAPIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of E. W. Mayman, at Sauk Rapids, Minn.]\r\n\r\nThis district comprises quite a large area, and a large amount of fruit\r\nof various kinds is raised. Besides the reports received, I visited a\r\ngood many places where fruit is being raised and intended visiting more\r\nexcept for unfavorable weather. From all sources the reports were that\r\nall fruit trees, vines and other plants came through the previous winter\r\nin good condition, and that all fruit trees budded and blossomed earlier\r\nthan usual. April being such a warm month caused this condition--and\r\nindications were for a record-breaking crop. But this was all changed\r\nafter the severe freeze of May 17th, which destroyed nearly all blossoms\r\nof apple and plum and what promise there was of cherry and grape. The\r\nfrost again on June the 8th did great damage to raspberries and\r\nstrawberries, currants and gooseberries. From all reports received and\r\nfrom my own observation at my place I can sum up briefly as follows:\r\n\r\nApples not more than five per cent. of crop; crab apples, no crop;\r\nplums, from ten to fifteen per cent. of a crop; cherries, very few\r\nplanted except the Compass and crop very light; grapes, not very\r\nextensively raised, Collegeville having the largest collection so far as\r\nI know, and at that place while the new growth had been frozen off still\r\na second growth of new wood was formed and gave a light crop of fruit.\r\n\r\nBlackberries: No crop reported.\r\n\r\nRaspberries: There is in this immediate vicinity upwards of twenty acres\r\nor more planted of several varieties, but the crop was very light, and\r\nfrom other places the reports received were the same.\r\n\r\nStrawberries: There is also quite a large acreage planted in this\r\nvicinity, but the crop the past season was very poor, except for the\r\neverbearing variety planted for experimental purposes. This variety did\r\nwell and continued to fruit to November 1st.\r\n\r\nCurrants and gooseberries: Reports gave no crop to speak of, and at my\r\nplace and in this vicinity while there is quite a large planting there\r\nwas no fruit. This, of course, was owing to the frost as before stated.\r\n\r\nVery little nursery stock has been planted except in small quantities\r\nhere and there, yet there is great interest taken in fruit raising.\r\n\r\nIn regard to blight, none to speak of according to reports, and\r\neverything indicates a good healthy growth.\r\n\r\nAs to spraying there seems to be little done along that line, although\r\nsome orchards have been sprayed.\r\n\r\nAll trees and shrubs and perennial plants planted the past season, as\r\nwell as those previously planted, made an exceptionally good growth,\r\nowing, I think, to the cool, moist spring and continued cool summer.\r\nAnd, all wood maturing early, everything, I think, has gone into winter\r\nquarters in very good condition, and other things being favorable we may\r\nexpect a good crop of everything next season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following poisoned wash has proved highly satisfactory in the West\r\nand promises to be one of the most popular methods of protecting trees\r\nfrom rabbits:\r\n\r\n_Poisoned Tree Wash._--Dissolve one ounce of strychnine sulphate in\r\nthree quarts of boiling water and add one-half pint of laundry starch,\r\npreviously dissolved in one pint of cold water. Boil this mixture until\r\nit becomes a clear paste. Add one ounce of glycerin and stir thoroughly.\r\nWhen sufficiently cool, apply to the trunks of trees with a paint brush.\r\nRabbits that gnaw the bark will be killed before the tree is injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Ninth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nMRS. H. E. WELD, MOORHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruit crop in general throughout this district was not very good.\r\nThe spring was late and cold with a heavy frost in June. Where the fruit\r\ntrees were protected by a natural windbreak, we find the best\r\nconditions. Wilkin, Becker, Ottertail counties' reports indicate that\r\nthe apple crop was small, but the fruit was of good quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of Louie Wentzel, Crookston, life member and\r\nvice-president in 1914]\r\n\r\nThe varieties that are grown in this district in order of their\r\nimportance and hardiness are the following: Hibernal, Duchess, Okabena,\r\nPatten's Greening and Wealthy. The hardier varieties of crabs are\r\ngrowing here. The Transcendent is the most popular crab. The Hyslop,\r\nFlorence and Whitney are also grown.\r\n\r\nBut very little blight is reported in this district.\r\n\r\nIn localities where the trees have the protection of a windbreak there\r\nwas a small crop of plums. The DeSoto, Forest Garden and Hansen hybrids\r\nare giving very good results. Even the wild plums were few, as the\r\nblossoms were hurt by frost.\r\n\r\nWhere there was windbreak protection the Compass cherry tree looks\r\nhealthy and has given a fair crop.\r\n\r\nGrapes have not been very generally planted. The Beta is the hardiest\r\nvariety. The Concord does well where properly planted and cared for.\r\n\r\nRaspberry bushes made a good growth and look healthy; although damaged\r\nby frost there was a fair crop.\r\n\r\nStrawberries yielded fairly well where they were given attention. The\r\nSenator Dunlap, Warfield and everbearing plants should be more generally\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nGooseberries and currants were just fair in some localities, in others\r\nthe late frost destroyed all prospects of small fruits. The Houghton and\r\nDowning gooseberries, Red Dutch and White Grape currants are some of the\r\nvarieties planted.\r\n\r\nIn Ottertail, Wilkin and Beltrami counties a good deal of nursery stock\r\nhas been planted and with very good success.\r\n\r\nVery little has been done in the way of spraying orchards, as trees are\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nAll fruits are going into winter in good condition, with fair amount of\r\nmoisture in the ground and trees full of fruit buds.\r\n\r\nThe hardy ornamental shrubs, honeysuckle, lilac, mock-orange and spirea\r\nVan Houttii can be grown here. Hardy perennial flowers that do well are\r\npeony, phlox, golden glow and bleeding heart. This northern section of\r\nthe state is the land for the hardy perennials. Nowhere else do we get\r\nsuch beautiful colorings and bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Madison Trial Station.\r\n\r\nM. SOHOLT, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis season has been very good. We have had plenty of rain, so that all\r\nnursery stock set out this last spring has made a good growth.\r\n\r\nThe first part of May a hard frost did quite a good deal of damage to\r\nsmall stock just planted or lined out in the nursery. This frost also\r\ndamaged the blossoms on the fruit trees. The plum trees happened to be\r\nin full bloom when this frost came, so that froze them entirely, and so\r\nwe did not get any plums to speak of. We also had a light crop of\r\napples, especially of the early varieties. The Northwestern and Patten's\r\nGreening bore a good crop.\r\n\r\nThe grapes also froze. I expected to get some fruit off those grape\r\nseedlings I received from the State Fruit-Breeding Farm three years ago,\r\nbut they went with the rest of it.\r\n\r\nThe plum trees I received this and two years ago are all doing well.\r\nThey did not freeze back any when we had that hard frost; so far they\r\nseem to be hardy for this location.\r\n\r\nHad a medium crop of raspberries, also a light crop of currants and\r\ngooseberries. We had a good crop of strawberries. Seedling strawberry\r\nNo. 3 is doing very well. Everbearing strawberries are doing nicely. We\r\nhad a nice fall and plenty of rain, so that trees and shrubbery went\r\ninto winter quarters in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Beans and Sweet Corn.\r\n\r\nP. B. MARIEN, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is one thing to grow beans and sweet corn and another to make\r\nmoney on them, I think from a market gardener's point of view my heading\r\nshould have been \"growing beans and sweet corn at a profit.\"\r\n\r\nI will talk of beans first, because while the two are planted at about\r\nthe same time, beans make their appearance on the market long before\r\nsweet corn.\r\n\r\nBeans have a nitrogen gathering power and are therefore a soil-improving\r\ncrop. They are to the gardener what clover is to the farmer. For early\r\nbeans we have found that sandy soil well fertilized is by far the best.\r\nIf possible it should be sloping toward the south, although we have had\r\ngood success on level land well drained. One should have the best seed\r\npossible, and if you get hold of a good strain of seed that produces\r\nnice, velvety beans earlier than your neighbor, save as much of that\r\nseed as you can. Of course now that the price of seed is $10.00 to\r\n$14.00 a bushel one cannot be too particular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. B. Marien, St. Paul.]\r\n\r\nToo much stress cannot be laid on the fact that to make money on beans\r\none must have them on the market within a week after the first ones make\r\ntheir appearance. To do this one must plant them at the right time. The\r\npractical gardener knows that as he sits near the stove with the ground\r\nstill frozen and a cold March wind blowing he cannot say \"I will plant\r\nmy beans on April 15 or on April 20.\" It is impossible to set a date for\r\nplanting. After the ground has been plowed and well tilled he must wait\r\nuntil it is well warmed. Sometimes it pays to take a chance, but we\r\nalways wait until the buds appear on the white oak trees. However there\r\nis nothing infallible about this rule, but it is the one we generally\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAs to kinds we have two wax beans which we have planted for many years:\r\nthe Davis, which does well in wet weather, and the Wardwell Kidney,\r\nwhich does well in dry weather. Every variety of green beans we have\r\never grown has done well.\r\n\r\nRows three feet apart, with the hills about six inches apart, three or\r\nfour seed in a hill, might take up too much room on a small scale, but\r\nwhere one uses horses to cultivate, I think it is about right.\r\n\r\nBeans should be cultivated at least two or three times a week, and they\r\nshould be hoed three times during the season. Never cultivate your beans\r\nwhile the dew is on, as it has a tendency to rust them.\r\n\r\nWhile St. Paul has not offered a very good market for medium and late\r\nstring beans in the last few years, it is a good plan to have a patch\r\ncome in about every ten days. Because you happen to get from $2.50 to\r\n$3.50 a bushel for your first beans this year, do not resolve to put the\r\nwhole farm into beans next year, for they might come three or four days\r\nlater than your neighbor's, and your profits might be like ours were one\r\nday last summer. I came to market with forty-eight bushels of beans.\r\nThey cost twenty cents for picking. I sold thirty-two bushels at thirty\r\ncents and offered the remaining sixteen bushels at twenty cents, but\r\nfound no sale for them. I brought them back home and to my surprise\r\nfound two extra bushels, making eighteen instead of sixteen bushels. I\r\nconcluded that someone had despaired of selling them and perhaps had\r\npoor success in trying to give them away and so forced them on me.\r\nHowever we consider we did well on our beans, as the first two pickings\r\nbrought from $2.00 to $3.50 per bushel.\r\n\r\nNow a few words about sweet corn. Along about the 6th to the 12th of\r\nJuly the truck gardener should load his first sweet corn. Sweet corn is\r\nof American origin, having been developed from field corn, or maize. No\r\nlarge vegetable is so generally grown throughout the country, the\r\nmarkets of the cities taking large quantities, and immense areas being\r\ngrown for canning purposes.\r\n\r\nSeed that fails entirely is not often found, but when one has a good\r\nstrain that produces early corn it is best to save some.\r\n\r\nWe generally have sweet corn to sell every day from about the middle of\r\nJuly until the first frost. To do this we plant every ten days from\r\nabout the 20th of April to the 20th of June. Our early variety is the\r\nPeep-O'Day, which is planted about the same time as the early beans. We\r\nalso plant the Golden Bantam at this time. This is followed by Red Cob\r\nCory, Pocahontas and some more Bantam. Then about May 15th to 20th we\r\nplant early and late Evergreen, Bantam and Country Gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A load of vegetables at Marien's ready for market.]\r\n\r\nSoil well adapted to common field corn will produce good sweet corn,\r\nthriving best on well fertilized land. Sandy soil is best for the early\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nSweet corn is often grown in drills, but we prefer the hills three feet\r\napart, as it is easier to get an even stand, and cultivating both ways\r\nwill push the crop. It should be cultivated shallow and never deep\r\nenough to hurt the roots. It is well to hoe it once.\r\n\r\nSweet corn is one of the few vegetables which is quite free from serious\r\ninjury from either insects or diseases.\r\n\r\nSweet corn may be divided into three classes: early, medium and late. It\r\nis very important that the various kinds come in as early as possible,\r\nas a few days make a lot of difference in price.\r\n\r\nSo you see that to make a profit on beans and sweet corn, four things\r\nare needed: good seed, planting at the right time, in the right kind of\r\nsoil, and plenty of elbow grease--or hard work.\r\n\r\nA member: How far apart do you plant your beans in the row?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: The rows three feet apart and the hills six inches, putting\r\nthree or four seeds in a hill.\r\n\r\nA Member: Don't you recommend testing your seeds before you plant them?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Hardly the bean seeds. I don't remember of ever having found\r\nany poor bean seeds.\r\n\r\nA Member: I mean seeds generally, corn, etc.?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Yes, sir, we do; we always test our seed.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: What is your method of harvesting your beans?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Well, we generally employ pickers, boys and girls, and we\r\npay them about twenty-five cents a bushel when they are above a dollar\r\nand a quarter, and then we keep going down; as the price goes down we go\r\ndown too; but we have paid as much as thirty cents when the price of\r\nbeans was high and it is important to get many on the market the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harvesting the hay crop at Marien's.]\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: What are your gross receipts per acre for beans?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: That is a hard question to answer, as sometimes it is very\r\npoor for the medium and late beans, and sometimes there aren't any\r\nreceipts at all. (Laughter.) But the early beans sometimes go as high as\r\n$250.00 an acre.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: How late can you plant them and be sure of a crop?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: We have planted them as late as the 15th of June.\r\n\r\nA Member: You mentioned Davis as your first variety. What is the second\r\none?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: The Wardwell Kidney. We always plant the two varieties at\r\nthe same time because if we strike a wet season then the Davis does\r\nwell, and the Wardwell won't do as well in wet weather but will do\r\nbetter in dry weather.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Will you tell me the color of your beans? Are they golden\r\nwax?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Yes, some golden wax and some green string beans. We haven't\r\nas good a market for the green ones.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Have they a string on the back?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Some have and some have not. There is the Bountiful, or the\r\nThousand to One; that is a small green string bean that hasn't any\r\nstring. But they are very hard to pick; so we don't raise many of them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Have you ever tried Golden Pod?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: I think that is a wax bean?\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: Oh, we don't like them, at least not on the St. Paul market,\r\nbecause they are hard to pick. I don't know how it is in the Minneapolis\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nA Member: What is the best of the green kind?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: We find that the Bountiful is a very good bean; and then\r\nthere is also the Red Valentine.\r\n\r\nA Member: Did you ever grow any Crusset Wax?\r\n\r\nMr. Marien: No, sir, I have not. Of course, there are some kinds that\r\nare just the same, but they go under different names in different\r\nplaces. Different catalogs will catalog the same seeds in a different\r\nway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEWARE BLIGHT CURES.--Almost every year orchardists are\r\npersuaded to try some new, so-called \"blight cure\" or preventative, only\r\nto find later that they have wasted time and money in the experiment.\r\nGovernment regulations regarding fake remedies of this character are\r\nmore strict than formerly, but there are still some agents trying to\r\ndupe the public into buying their wares.\r\n\r\nBlight, which is often referred to as apple blight, fire blight, or pear\r\nblight, is caused by bacteria which live in the sap of the tree, and the\r\nprinciple followed by the blight-doctor is to introduce something into\r\nthe sap which will prevent the working of the bacteria. The remedies are\r\napplied in various ways. Sometimes the trunk is painted with a mixture\r\nof some kind, or holes are bored into the trunk and these filled with a\r\npowder. The orchardist is sometimes furnished with a box of nails as the\r\nfirst \"course\" and instructed to drive these into the roots of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that anything introduced into the sap that is strong\r\nenough to kill the bacteria living there will likewise damage the cell\r\ntissue of the tree, and result in more harm than benefit. One powder\r\nthat has been brought to the attention of the Experiment Station, sells\r\nfor $3.00 per pound, and is administered in teaspoonful \"doses.\" Such a\r\npreparation as this is probably harmless, but is a waste of time and\r\nmoney. It would have no effect on the tree or the blight.\r\n\r\nSome of the agents not only claim that their remedies will cure blight,\r\nbut, due to ignorance or other causes, they also claim that trees\r\ntreated will be immune from attacks of certain insects.\r\n\r\nOrchardists may rest assured that up to the present time, no real\r\npreventative or cure has been found for blight, and that the only way it\r\ncan be controlled is by cutting it out.--Colorado Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM--MRS. E. CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Erasmus Cross, of Sauk Rapids, and a member of the Minnesota State\r\nHorticultural Society since 1888 (27 years), passed away at that place\r\non Tuesday, December 28th. On December 16th Mrs. Cross sustained a\r\npainful injury by falling on the floor and breaking her hip. Owing to\r\nher advanced age, eighty-two years, the limb could not be set without\r\nthe use of chloroform, which could not be given on account of weakness\r\nof the heart. Death finally released her from her suffering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The late Mrs. E. Cross, daughter and grandaughters.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Jane Cross was always very enthusiastic about the Horticultural\r\nSociety and the good it was doing, not only for this but other states.\r\nThe ills of her age had prevented her from attending the meetings these\r\nlate years, though she often did so in earlier years, but she always\r\nsent her fee through the writer, and eagerly awaited her return from the\r\nmeeting to hear of its stimulating success. Mr. Cross died about six\r\nyears ago. Two sons, James, of St. Paul, and Robert, of Sauk Rapids, and\r\ntwo daughters, Mrs. Annie Nicholson, of Hamline, and Mrs. Emma\r\nSovereign, of Sauk Rapids, mourn her loss. Our society has lost a most\r\nloyal friend.--Mrs. Jennie Stager, Sauk Rapids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes from Prof. Alway's interesting and instructive talk on\r\n\"Maintaining the fertility of our gardens.\"\r\n\r\nRequisites for proper plant growth are warmth, ventilation, root room,\r\nthe absence of harmful alkalies or animals that destroy the beneficial\r\nbacteria in the soil, water and plant food.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important requisite for growth is water. More plants and\r\ncrops fail because of the lack of a proper amount of it than from any\r\nother cause.\r\n\r\nPlenty of fresh air is needed by the plants, as they derive a portion of\r\ntheir food from it.\r\n\r\nThey adapt themselves largely to conditions as to root-room, a plant\r\nthriving in a pot, but spreading to much greater root space when grown\r\nin the open with plenty of room. The more restricted the root space, the\r\nmore food and water it will require.\r\n\r\nThe fourth requisite for growth does not concern us as there are no\r\nalkali lands in the counties near the Twin Cities, and the harmful\r\nminute animals that destroy the beneficial bacteria in the soil are as a\r\nrule found only in greenhouses.\r\n\r\nThe best fertilizer for the garden is the thorough use of the hose.\r\n\r\nEach year stable manures become harder to obtain, but the fertility of\r\nthe garden can be maintained by the use of commercial fertilizers, which\r\nare more concentrated foods and are much easier to work with.\r\n\r\nThe perfect plant food consists of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash. We\r\ncan obtain these in separate form and use as we need them.\r\n\r\nNitrogen comes in the form of a salt, called nitrate of soda, and in\r\ndried blood. The nitrate of soda is very soluble in water and is taken\r\nup at once by the plant. It can be scattered upon the ground near but\r\nnot touching the plant, as in the latter case it would burn it. It can\r\nalso be dissolved in water--a tablespoonful to a pail--and the ground,\r\nbut not the plant, watered. Dried blood is slower in action and requires\r\nwarmth, so should not be used early in the season. Nitrogen promotes\r\nquick and luxuriant growth of leaves and stems and is good to use when a\r\ngreen growth of any kind is wished.\r\n\r\nIn bone meal we find the phosphorus necessary to aid in the development\r\nof fine and many flowers, to expand root growth and to hasten maturity.\r\nIt works slowly, so can be applied to the ground about a plant early in\r\nthe season, and will be available in the ground the following year if\r\nenough is used. Equal parts of nitrate and bone meal can be used at the\r\nrate of one to two pounds to every one hundred square feet.\r\n\r\nPotash is almost off the market, as a result of the war, the main supply\r\nbeing imported from Germany. It can be obtained from hardwood ashes, and\r\nevery bit of these should be saved for the garden and stored in a dry\r\nplace where they will not become leached out by the action of water.\r\n\r\n_April Spraying._--Snowball bushes and others that have been troubled\r\nwith aphides, or plant lice, the previous year should receive a thorough\r\nspraying of Black Leaf No. 40 (an extract of forty per cent. nicotine)\r\nbefore the leaf buds expand. For this early spraying, two tablespoonsful\r\nof the extract can be used to every gallon of water. It will stick to\r\nthe branches better if some soap is dissolved in it. This spray will\r\nkill most of the eggs of these pests, which will be found near the leaf\r\nbuds. When the leaves open another spraying should be given to kill all\r\nthose that escaped the first treatment. For spraying after the leaves\r\nopen use one tablespoonful to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeeting of the Minnesota Garden Flower Society, April 27th, St. Paul,\r\nWilder Auditorium, Fifth and Washington Streets, 2:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nNative Plants in the Garden\r\nShall We Collect or Grow Our Native Plants?\r\nRoadside Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN.\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees are kept both for profit and for pleasure. The old fashioned\r\nbeekeeper with his hybrid bees, kept in immovable hives, logs or boxes,\r\ndid not derive much profit from his bees. He kept them mostly for\r\npastime. During the last fifteen years men with new methods of\r\nmanagement and modern equipment have been rapidly superseding the\r\npicturesque old beekeepers. Modern beekeeping courses are now taught in\r\nconnection with our institutions of learning, and young men full of\r\nenergy and ambition are beginning to realize that beekeeping is offering\r\none of the few opportunities to make a comfortable living with a\r\ncomparatively small expense. Older beekeepers, both on the farm and\r\nprofessional men, also are beginning to study beekeeping. They attend\r\nshort courses, subscribe to scientific bee papers and study bee\r\nliterature. With increased study and knowledge the whole status of the\r\nbeekeeping industry is just now undergoing a rapid change. Professional\r\nbeekeepers, men who devote their whole time to beekeeping, are\r\nincreasing, and more amateurs are turning to professional beekeeping\r\nevery year. Organizations of beekeepers now exist in nearly every state.\r\nTheir object is to spread knowledge among their members and to secure\r\nbetter prices for their product by co-operative marketing. Contrary to\r\nfears of more conservative beekeepers the demand for a first class\r\narticle of honey is increasing more rapidly than the supply. A national\r\norganization of beekeepers and bee societies is taking up just now\r\nnational problems in connection with their industry and has succeeded in\r\nmaking the government interested in this \"infant industry.\" An\r\nappropriation of $200,000 has just been allowed by the agricultural\r\ncommittee of the Congress to develop beekeeping in localities where help\r\nis needed. The state of Minnesota allows an annual appropriation for\r\nbeekeeping interests of $10,000, divided among the following branches:\r\nBee inspection department, which takes charge of bee diseases, $2,000;\r\nstate fair exhibits for premiums and maintenance of a bee and honey\r\nbuilding in connection with our State Fair, $1,500. The Division of Bee\r\nCulture at the University Farm, which has charge of teaching,\r\ndemonstration, extension work, research, queen rearing, correspondence,\r\nstatistics and model apiaries, $6,500. Minnesota beekeepers should be\r\ngrateful to those men who have helped them to raise their industry from\r\na mere nothing, until we have become the acknowledged leaders in\r\nbeekeeping among all the states of the Union. They, however, are rapidly\r\nfollowing, nearly all states now have efficient bee inspection laws, and\r\ntwelve universities have followed our lead and have included beekeeping\r\nin their curriculum.\r\n\r\nBut we must not be satisfied with what we have accomplished. Out of\r\n$14,000,000 worth of honey which this state produces (by figuring) only\r\n$1,000,000 worth are gathered every year, and beekeeping in the state\r\nmust grow to fourteen times its present proportions before it will be\r\nanywhere near its possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD NOTES.\r\n\r\nConducted monthly by R. S. MACKINTOSH, Horticulturist, Extension\r\nDivision, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinnesota orchardists are preparing for a full crop of apples this year.\r\nFrom the experiences of last year with apple scab and codling moth, more\r\nthorough spraying is to be done. Senator Dunlap stated an experience he\r\nhad in spraying that should be carefully considered by all apple men.\r\nNine rows of trees were sprayed on Monday or Tuesday. Owing to bad\r\nweather the other rows could not be sprayed until Friday or Saturday.\r\nWhat was the result? He had 175 barrels of No. 1 fruit from first part\r\nand only seventeen barrels of No. 2 in rows sprayed later. Some are\r\nplanning their orchard work for the season along the following lines:\r\n\r\n_First: Pruning._ To be done during the mild weather in March and April.\r\nThin out all dead wood, interlocking branches, water-sprouts and shorten\r\nothers. Pruning is to get the tree into better form to sustain a large\r\nload of fruit, to open the center to permit sunlight to get in to color\r\nfruit, and to permit of better spraying. There are too many trees in\r\nMinnesota that have never been touched by knife or saw. Such trees need\r\nattention, but the pruning should not be too severe at any one time.\r\nBegin this year to do a little pruning; next year do more; the year\r\nafter a little more; and after that very little attention will be needed\r\nto keep the tree in good condition.\r\n\r\nWhile pruning look out for rabbit and mouse injury. If good trees have\r\nbeen injured do some bridge grafting as soon as you can. This means\r\nconnecting the healthy bark above the wound with the healthy bark below.\r\nSmall twigs cut from the same tree, that are long enough to span the\r\nwound, are cut wedge shaped on both ends, and these ends put under the\r\nhealthy bark. If possible cover the wounded area with earth. If too high\r\nup tie the scions in place and cover all cut surfaces with grafting wax\r\nand cloth. Several scions should be put in if the tree is large.\r\n\r\n_Second: Spraying._ Three sprayings are needed on every bearing apple\r\ntree in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nFirst spray: When the center of buds show pink. Don't wait too long.\r\n\r\nSecond spray: When the petals have fallen.\r\n\r\nThird spray: Ten to fifteen days after the second.\r\n\r\nUse lime-sulphur and arsenate of lead each time. It is important to do\r\nthis at the right time, in the right way, and with the right materials.\r\nRight is the word and not left-undone. Further particulars will be found\r\non the page devoted to spraying topics.\r\n\r\n_Third: Cultivation._ Follow the plan that is best suited to location.\r\nThis may mean sod, part sod and cultivation, cultivation and mulch,\r\nmulch only, or cultivation and cover crop. Doubtless the last is the\r\nbest in most instances.\r\n\r\n_Fourth: Thinning._ The thinning of apples in Minnesota has not been\r\nreceived with as much consideration as its importance demands. More\r\nattention will be given to this topic in subsequent issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME GARDEN.\r\n\r\nWhat about the farm and home garden for 1916? Is the garden to receive\r\nthe undivided attention of one or more members of each family, so that\r\nall members and guests may share its fruits? Let's make the home garden\r\nthe best spot on every Minnesota farm in 1916. A conservative estimate\r\nof the actual value of the products from a half-acre garden is fifty\r\ndollars. In Minnesota there are over 150,000 farms. This would mean a\r\ntotal value of over $7,000,000. This does not include the value of the\r\nproducts of the village and city gardens. Careful estimates made in this\r\nstate show that it costs about fifteen dollars for man and horse labor\r\nto take care of a garden of about three-fourths of an acre. Now for a\r\nBIG GARDEN MOVEMENT this year--for all the year. Not a big beginning\r\nkept up until the little weeds become big weeds. Is anyone going to\r\nallow weeds to outdo him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON PLANT PESTS.\r\n\r\nPrepared by Section of Insect Pests, A. G. RUGGLES, and by\r\nSection of Plant Diseases, E. C. STAKMAN, University Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuy spray materials as soon as possible. The orchardist will probably\r\nnotice very little difference in the price of his spraying materials,\r\nlike arsenate of lead and lime-sulphur, as compared with last year; but\r\nthose who still think that Paris green is the only good stomach\r\ninsecticide, will be astounded by this year's price. At the present\r\ntime, in one pound lots, the retailer cannot sell Paris green for less\r\nthan 50c per pound--over twice what it was last year. In large\r\nquantities, it is doubtful if it can be purchased for less than 45c per\r\npound. Fortunately arsenate of lead, a better stomach insecticide than\r\nParis green, has not advanced materially in price, the powdered form\r\nbeing obtained for about 25c per pound. One and one-half pounds of this\r\npowder is used in fifty gallons of spray mixture. In our experiments, we\r\nhave found arsenate of lead superior to Paris green as a remedy for\r\npotato bugs and all orchard insects. It is not necessary, therefore, to\r\nallow any injurious biting insect to live simply because Paris green is\r\nhigh in price. Arsenate of lead, if properly applied at the right time,\r\nwill keep any of these insects in check.\r\n\r\nA dormant wash does little good in controlling scab. Hence, on account\r\nof the high price of spraying compounds, do not spray when unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMany diseases of nursery stock are controlled by spraying. Begin\r\nspraying as soon as leaf buds unfold, with lime-sulphur 1-40 or Bordeaux\r\nmixture 4-4-50.\r\n\r\nCopper-sulphate has also advanced 15c or 16c per pound. Lime-sulphur has\r\nnot advanced materially; therefore, plan to use lime-sulphur or some of\r\nthe made-up (paste) Bordeaux instead of Bordeaux mixture, whenever\r\npossible. _Potatoes can not be sprayed with lime-sulphur._\r\n\r\nThe aphis problem is usually a very serious one, because they are such\r\npersistent little breeders. The trees or shrubs most affected are roses,\r\nsnowball, currant, apple, plum and elm. The eggs of the plant lice pass\r\nthe winter on the bark or buds of these plants and hatch as the buds\r\nbegin to swell. Spray with the lime-sulphur (1-9) at this time. As soon\r\nas the leaves appear, spray with nicotine-sulphate as per directions on\r\nthe container.\r\n\r\nIf plum pocket was bad last year, the trees should be thoroughly pruned.\r\nThen spray with copper-sulphate, one pound to nine gallons of water, or\r\nlime-sulphur, one gallon with nine gallons of water, before the buds\r\nopen. Follow with one to forty lime-sulphur or other spray as for brown\r\nrot. Control methods for plum pocket are not well worked out, so these\r\nmethods cannot be depended upon entirely.\r\n\r\nBe sure and look over the apple trees carefully; cut out and burn all\r\ncankers. Black rot has been increasing in the state, and since a great\r\ndeal of early infection may come from cankered limbs, it is important\r\nthat cutting out and burning be resorted to.\r\n\r\nLast year the spring canker worm was just as active in the state as the\r\nfall canker worm; therefore, just as soon as possible, trees affected\r\nlast year should be banded with the tree tanglefoot. The moths come out\r\nof the soil the first two weeks in April and at that time attempt to\r\ncrawl up the trunks of the trees to lay their eggs on the limbs.\r\n\r\nWhen raspberries are uncovered, be sure to cut out and burn all dead\r\ncanes missed last fall. The gray bark disease and anthracnose, also\r\nsnowy tree cricket and red-necked cane borer, are controlled in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nPlan to keep the young canes covered with a protective spray of\r\nresin-Bordeaux mixture. Try it on at least part of the patch. The\r\nbenefit will not be apparent for a year.\r\n\r\nSpray currants and gooseberries as soon as leaf buds begin to unfold,\r\nwith either Bordeaux mixture 4-4-50 or lime-sulphur 1-40, to prevent\r\npowdery mildew and leaf spots.\r\n\r\nFor further information write to the section concerned. Inquiries will\r\nreceive prompt attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING OF AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF\r\nNURSERYMEN.--Information has reached this office to the effect that\r\nthis national association will hold its annual meeting in Milwaukee June\r\n28th to 30th. This is so near by that it ought to bring a goodly number\r\nof Minnesota nurserymen in attendance. For particulars in regard to the\r\nmatter address John Hill, 204 Granite Bldg., Rochester, N.Y.\r\n\r\nPASSING OF HANS KNUDSON.--Mr. Knudson, late of Springfield,\r\nMinn., was the originator of the Compass cherry, which has been\r\ngenerally planted throughout the Northwest these recent years. He grew\r\nthis variety from a seed as a result of a handmade cross between the\r\nMiner plum and the sand cherry. Mr. Knudson had other seedlings of\r\nsimilar origin which we thought might be of value, but nothing has been\r\nsince heard from them. News of his passing early in January has just\r\ncome to this office.\r\n\r\nTHE MCINTOSH RED.--I think the McIntosh is quite hardy as a\r\ntop-worked tree; there are two in my old orchard set in 1894, and they\r\nhave shown no signs of injury. They were grafted on crab whips, but they\r\nwere planted on a knoll, that while clay was within twelve to fifteen\r\ninches of a deep bed of sand. They have been shy bearers, but I think on\r\na clay subsoil, such as I now have, they might prove good bearers. I\r\nwould not be afraid to risk them as to hardiness.--F. W. Kimball,\r\nWaltham, Minn.\r\n\r\nREPORTS FOR MINNEAPOLIS MEMBERS.--Every member of the society\r\nis entitled to a copy of the annual report if desired. As there are not\r\nas many copies printed, however, as there are members, if every one\r\nasked for a copy we should be in trouble at once. Copies are mailed as\r\npromptly as possible after receiving membership fee to all members\r\nexcept those living in Minneapolis and those who come in as members of\r\nsome auxiliary society. Minneapolis members are requested to call at the\r\nsociety office and secure the copy to which they are entitled, which\r\nwill then get into their hands in a good deal better shape than though\r\nit passed through the postoffice. Members of auxiliary societies are\r\nentitled to a copy of the report, but only upon the prepayment of\r\npostage, which would be seven cents to points within 150 miles of\r\nMinneapolis and ten cents outside that limit.\r\n\r\nSCIONS FOR TOP-WORKING.--Stark Bros. Nurseries, of Louisiana,\r\nMo., have sent to us for use in testing on top-worked trees a quantity\r\nof scions of the following varieties: King David, Jonathan, Delicious,\r\nStayman Winesap, York Imperial and Liveland Raspberry. These scions are\r\nto be used primarily to fill orders for top-working from members who\r\nhave selected them as one of the plant premiums, No. 8. There will,\r\nhowever, be a considerable surplus, we believe, and as far as they hold\r\nout we shall be glad to send them out to members of the society who have\r\ntrees for top-working, and know how to graft properly, upon receipt of\r\npostage stamps to the amount of postage and packing, which would be\r\napproximately ten cents. We are not sure that we can supply all who may\r\nask for them, but to a limited extent we can do so. I would suggest\r\npromptness in making application for these scions. Address Secy.\r\nLatham.\r\n\r\nWHO IS GROWING MCINTOSH RED APPLE?--Information from an\r\ninterested member of the society is called for as to what success, if\r\nany, has been had in growing the McIntosh Red top-worked on hardy trees\r\nhere in Minnesota. Scions of this variety have been sent out several\r\nyears by the society and probably some have already come into fruitage,\r\nor perhaps they have been secured from other sources. Replies will be\r\npublished. Address Secy. Latham.\r\n\r\nNO PLANT PREMIUMS AFTER APRIL 1ST.--All members ordering plant\r\npremiums have undoubtedly noted this important condition that \"all\r\napplications for plant premiums must be made prior to April 1st.\" This\r\ncondition will be strictly adhered to, and those sending in selections\r\nfor plant premiums after that date need not feel disappointed if they do\r\nnot receive them. It is absolutely necessary to make a definite date\r\nbeyond which no applications will be received in order to work out\r\nsuccessfully the problem of distribution which faces us at that time.\r\n\r\nTO MEMBERS OF AUXILIARY SOCIETIES.--Occasionally a member of an\r\nauxiliary society writes to this office asking for a copy of the annual\r\nvolume of the society. Members of auxiliary societies are entitled to\r\nthis volume, but the State Society does not pay postage on it, the\r\namount received from auxiliary societies for memberships not permitting\r\nthis expense. Any member of any auxiliary society who wishes to have a\r\ncopy of the annual volume mailed from this office should send with the\r\napplication postage at the rate of seven cents if within one hundred\r\nfifty miles of Minneapolis, and ten cents to points in the state more\r\nthan one hundred fifty miles from Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nBUY NURSERY STOCK AT HOME.--There are always more or less\r\nagents of foreign nurseries, that is nurseries located outside the\r\nstate, canvassing for orders of nursery stock in our state, and many\r\ncitizens are also tempted to reply to advertisements of outside\r\nnurseries who are trying to secure business in Minnesota. It is not my\r\npurpose to condemn these outside nurseries nor their methods of doing\r\nbusiness, which in most cases undoubtedly are honorable and straight\r\nforward. But there is a real advantage in buying nursery stock at home,\r\nthat is, from nurserymen located in our own state, and especially from\r\nnurserymen who are in the immediate vicinity. There is no class of goods\r\nthat one can buy in connection with which there is such opportunity for\r\nmistake and fraud as in nursery stock. It is impossible for any but an\r\nexpert to tell by the appearance of a tree or plant of any kind what the\r\nvariety is, and either through mistake or purposely it is no uncommon\r\nthing for those purchasing trees to be disappointed as to the names of\r\nvarieties when they come into fruitage or flower. If the nurseries are\r\nin our own state, or in our vicinity, it is a very easy matter to get at\r\nthem, and they will almost uniformly be found willing to make good such\r\nblunders, or if they don't and the matter is worth while they can be\r\nmade to do so. Don't place your orders outside of the state if the\r\nthings you want can be purchased at home. You will find it a real\r\nadvantage to act on this counsel. Especially in the case of strawberry\r\nplants the element of distance is a very important one as on account of\r\ntheir leafy character they heat and spoil readily. A few plants near\r\nhome are often worth more to the recipient than a large shipment from\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nNURSERYMEN OF MINNESOTA.--The secretary endeavors to keep a\r\ncorrect list of all those engaged in the nursery business in this state.\r\nAs far as his personal acquaintance goes of course the list is known to\r\nbe a correct one, but there are doubtless a number engaged in the\r\nnursery business in a small way of whom he does not know personally, and\r\nhe would be glad to hear from any engaged in the nursery business who\r\nare not personally acquainted with him so that their names may be added\r\nto this list. The address of the secretary is always to be found on the\r\nfront cover page of this magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL ELEMENT AT OUR ANNUAL MEETING.--Those of our members\r\nwho attended the last annual meeting could not have failed to note the\r\nlarge proportion of ladies in attendance at these meetings, not only at\r\nthe one managed by the Woman's Auxiliary, but also at every other\r\nmeeting during the four days session. You may be surprised to learn that\r\napproximately one-third of those who registered as purposing to attend\r\nthe meeting belonged to the gentler sex, and the proportion in\r\nattendance was somewhere in that neighborhood. This is one of the\r\ndelightful features of our annual gathering which is steadily\r\nincreasing. More and more are the ladies attending our meetings, and in\r\nlarger number are they becoming members of the association aside from\r\nany relation they may sustain as wives or daughters to those who are\r\nalready members. This movement should be in every way encouraged, and we\r\nhope another year to be able to offer still more attractive\r\naccommodations in this direction. In planning for a new building for the\r\nsociety, this feature of our work should not by any means be lost sight\r\nof. I believe that very few organizations of this kind can boast so\r\nlarge an interest on the part of the ladies in the various branches of\r\nits work.\r\n\r\nDID YOU SELECT EVERBEARING STRAWBERRIES AS YOUR PREMIUM?--An\r\naltogether unexpected demand has been made upon us for the Everbearing\r\nStrawberries the society is offering as plant premiums to its members\r\nthis spring. Probably twice as many plants have been called for as can\r\nbe furnished in the amount asked for. Under the \"right of substitution\"\r\nwhich the society reserves in the matter of its plant premiums, probably\r\nplant premium No. 16 will be substituted for Nos. 17 and 18 if matters\r\nturn out as now appears, though the number of plants sent will be more\r\nthan is offered under No. 16. As this everbearing strawberry, originated\r\nat the fruit-breeding farm, No. 1017, is a very prolific plant maker, a\r\ndozen plants, if the runners are allowed to grow, will make plants\r\nenough to set out a bed of them next year, large enough in all\r\nprobability for family use.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of June-bearing strawberry No. 3, offered as premium,\r\nthere is undoubtedly stock enough to fill all orders including those\r\nasked for for which money has been sent, and we are in hopes that orders\r\nfor raspberry No. 4 can be filled in their entirety, though it may be\r\nnecessary to return money which has been sent for additional plants.\r\n\r\nIn this distribution all members will be treated exactly alike and\r\naltogether in accordance with the conditions noted in connection with\r\nthe list of premiums as found on page six of the society folder and on\r\nthe inside front cover page of the magazine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN FRUIT-BREEDING GREENHOUSE, STATE COLLEGE,\r\nBROOKINGS, S.D.\r\n\r\nThis is Prof. N.

N. E. HANSEN, HORTICULTURIST, BROOKINGS, S.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term hardiness is understood the capacity to resist against any\r\nspecial condition of environment. So in speaking of hardiness of the\r\nplant it may mean hardiness as to either cold, heat, drouth, fungus or\r\ninsect trouble. In the present discussion hardiness against cold will be\r\nconsidered mainly, since that is the most difficult problem we have to\r\nmeet in this horticultural field. It would be of great advantage could\r\nwe determine by examination of the plant its power to resist cold. If we\r\ncould determine by the looks of a new apple tree its power of resistance\r\nto our test winters, it would save us many thousands of dollars and much\r\nvexation of spirit. Some years ago the Iowa State Horticultural Society\r\nmade a determined and praiseworthy effort to determine hardiness by some\r\ncharacteristic of the plant, especially in apple trees. A chemical test\r\nof the sap of hardy and tender varieties was made. The palisade cells of\r\nthe leaf, and the cellular structure of the wood, were examined under\r\nhigh powers of the microscope to determine some means by which a tender\r\nvariety could be distinguished from a hardy one, but no general rule or\r\nconclusion could be formulated. In a general way nurserymen and\r\norchardists say that a variety that ripens its wood well in the fall\r\nshows it by the twigs being sturdy and not easily bent, while twigs that\r\nare not well ripened indicate lack of hardiness.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1884-85 was preceded by a late, wet autumn that kept trees\r\nof all varieties growing very late, so that winter came before the wood\r\nwas ripened. In all the literature on this subject, I have been unable\r\nto find any method by which a hardy variety could be distinguished from\r\na tender one of the same species, or, in other words, there is no\r\ncorrelation between morphology and hardiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough we do not know what determines hardiness, we may still go ahead\r\nwith our experimental work. We do not really know what electricity is,\r\nbut inventors in that line have enough of a theory on this subject so\r\nthat they are able to work very successfully with this gigantic force of\r\nnature. We know there is a difference in hardiness between the red cedar\r\nof Tennessee and the red cedar of Minnesota, and that it is safest for\r\nus to plant the tree as it is found at the north. The same applies to\r\nmany other trees that are found native over a wide area. At Moscow,\r\nRussia, the box elder as first imported was from St. Louis, and it\r\nwinter-killed. Afterwards they got the box elder from Manitoba, and it\r\nproved perfectly hardy. Although botanically both are the same, yet\r\nthere is a difference in hardiness.\r\n\r\nMy way of securing hardiness is to work with plants that are already\r\nhardy. I like to work with native plums in my plant breeding experiments\r\nbecause there need be no concern about their hardiness. We know they are\r\nhardy, or they would not be here after thousands of years of natural\r\nselection in this climate.\r\n\r\nThe other way of obtaining hardiness is by crossing a tender variety\r\nwith a hardy one. When we cross the native plum with the Japanese plum,\r\nwe obtain seedlings that combine in a fair measure the hardiness of the\r\nnative plum with the size and quality of the Japanese plum.\r\n\r\nIn many states of the Union the question of varieties for commercial\r\norchards has been to a large degree settled. There is always room for a\r\nnew apple, but for commercial purposes the varieties already in\r\ncultivation are sufficiently satisfactory as to size, color and quality\r\nas well as in keeping and shipping capacity. So the main effort in their\r\nhorticultural societies is along other lines, such questions as\r\nmarketing, packing, spraying, insects, fungi and orchard management. But\r\nin this region the winter apple question is still a vital one.\r\n\r\nSome promising winter apples have appeared recently, and it remains to\r\nbe seen whether they will stand up under the next test winter. They are\r\ncertainly satisfactory in size, color, quality and keeping capacity.\r\n\r\nThe greatest question now presents itself in planting apple seed. What\r\nvariety shall I choose? Some pedigrees may be like a blind alley, they\r\nwill lead us nowhere. The commercial apples of the East and of the\r\nPacific Coast are the survivors of millions of apple seedlings raised\r\nby immigrants from Western Europe during the past three centuries. They\r\nsurvived because they were the best. From time to time very good\r\nvarieties are super-ceded by new ones that appear. From the ashes of\r\nmillions of seedlings will arise, Phoenix-like, the creations that will\r\ndominate our future prairie pomology. Here in the Northwest thousands of\r\nfarmers have already determined to a considerable extent what we may\r\nexpect from planting the seed of certain standard varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Waneta plum. A promising variety originated and\r\nintroduced by Prof. N. E. Hansen.]\r\n\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa are full of seedlings of the Duchess. Some\r\nof the best are Okabena, Peerless, Patten's Greening, Milwaukee, Dudley,\r\nPewaukee. A very large amount of Wealthy seed has been planted,\r\nespecially in Minnesota. Many of these give promise, but in none do we\r\nappear to have obtained the true winter-keeping capacity. The Wealthy\r\nhas given us the Lord's L, Evelyn, Lyman Sweet, Perfect and many more,\r\nobserved at Minnesota state fairs from time to time. The Malinda has\r\ngiven us in the Perkins' seedlings a number of promising new varieties\r\nthat evidently are true winter keepers. The fact that they appear hardy\r\nmay come from the fact that the original orchard had hardy varieties,\r\nlike the Duchess, standing near the Malinda. From the experience with\r\nthese three varieties I would like to draw the conclusion that in order\r\nto get winter apples we should save the seed of winter apples, but it\r\nwould not be safe to draw this conclusion without further experiments.\r\nThere is an immense number of Ben Davis seedlings in Missouri and\r\nadjoining states, but none appear to have come into extensive commercial\r\nnotice except the Black Ben Davis and Gano. But as near as I can learn\r\nwe cannot obtain real hardiness from this line of descent, unless the\r\nBen Davis in the mother orchard is standing near varieties like the\r\nDuchess.\r\n\r\nThe seed of standard winter apples top-grafted on hardy stocks like\r\nHibernal should be carefully saved as nature may have smiled with\r\nindulgence upon your efforts and created the desired variety. I am\r\nwatching with great interest a tree of very vigorous, smooth growth,\r\nfrom seed of Talman Sweet top-grafted on Duchess. You would not expect\r\nto get anything hardy from seed of the Talman Sweet, but the entire\r\nhardiness so far of the young trees propagated from the original\r\nseedling, makes me impatient to see the fruit. A blend of Talman Sweet\r\nand Duchess ought certainly to bring something good, but they will not\r\nall be hardy or all good. The fact that there are so many different\r\nlines of pedigree available to us in our apple work, makes it all the\r\nmore necessary for us to divide the work.\r\n\r\nLet us gather inspiration from the story of Johnny Apple-Seed--one of\r\nthe patron saints of American horticulture--who about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five years ago forced his way through the wilderness of Indiana\r\nand Ohio and planted many bushels of apple seed as he went along, so\r\nthat when settlers came they found their orchards ready for them. The\r\nstory of John Chapman and his unselfish efforts in planting the seed of\r\napples and other fruits in the American wilderness should give us\r\ncourage and patience to give a little of our time to this work. Make a\r\nrecord of what seeds you plant, and when the seedlings are one year of\r\nage plant them out in a row where they can be cultivated. Select the\r\nbest ones as they fruit and bring to the state fair or horticultural\r\nmeeting. You may not win the grand prize, but you will have the\r\nsatisfaction of having made some contribution to the common welfare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn localities where cottontails are sufficiently abundant to be a\r\ncontinual menace, the safest and most nearly permanent method of\r\nsecuring immunity from their ravages is to fence against them. It has\r\nbeen found that woven wire netting of one and one-half inch mesh and\r\nthirty inches high will exclude rabbits, provided, that the lower border\r\nof the fence is buried five or six inches below the surface of the\r\nground. In cases where a small number of trees are concerned, a cylinder\r\nof similar wire netting around each tree, if so fastened that it cannot\r\nbe pushed up close against the tree, serves the purpose more\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandardizing Minnesota Potatoes.\r\n\r\nA. W. AAMODT, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n(Gideon Memorial Contest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potato is one of the large farm crops of the country, rating next to\r\nthe cereals in importance. According to the census report of 1909,\r\nUnited States produced 389,194,965 bushels, and three-fourths of these\r\nwere consumed in the states in which they were produced. The report also\r\nshows that the most extensive production was along the northern tier of\r\nstates, from Maine to Minnesota. In 1909 the states ranked in production\r\nas follows: New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine, Minnesota,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois and Colorado. In the same year\r\nMinnesota ranked fourth in surplus production, producing sixteen per\r\ncent. of the potatoes which entered into interstate commerce. Wisconsin\r\nproduced twenty per cent., Michigan twenty-four per cent. and Maine\r\ntwenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure I. Rural New Yorker.]\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota the largest part of these potatoes are grown in certain\r\ndistricts of the state, and according to the 1909 census the counties\r\nrank in respective order, namely: Hennepin, Isanti, Chisago, Clay,\r\nAnoka, Sherburne, Washington, Ottertail, Dakota, and Mille Lacs. This\r\nshows that the largest production is in the vicinity of St. Paul and\r\nMinneapolis, and the Red River Valley, especially in Clay County.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows the per cent. of increase in acreage from\r\n1900 to 1910 and that the older districts are being rapidly outdone by\r\nthe counties towards the northern part of the state:\r\n\r\nClay, 455 per cent.; Sherburne, 254 per cent.; Polk, 136 per cent.;\r\nTodd, 109 per cent.; Hennepin, 83 per cent.; Anoka, 58 per cent.;\r\nIsanti, 26 per cent.; Chisago, 17 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom these reports it is also evident that the distribution of the\r\nsurplus is entirely towards the southern states, either as table stock\r\nor as seed potatoes, which in turn varies with the different years\r\nbecause of differences in crop yields. But as a general rule Maine, New\r\nYork and Michigan supply the states in the east, east central and\r\nsoutheastern part of the country, Wisconsin the Chicago market and\r\nMinnesota the Mississippi Valley, especially Nebraska and Kansas. In\r\naddition Minnesota ships seed potatoes to many of the Southern states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure II. Burbank.]\r\n\r\nBecause of these markets, potato shippers maintain that competition is\r\nextremely keen between the potato growing sections of this country.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the only way Minnesota can meet her increase\r\nin yield and increase in demand is to determine whether or not she will\r\nexpand her markets to the territory which is now being held by the other\r\nstates. But before Minnesota can get these markets and obtain the better\r\nprices, she must standardize her potatoes. That is, Minnesota can\r\nobtain great improvement by adopting certain standards for the grading\r\nand sorting of potatoes.\r\n\r\nAt a conference held in Chicago, last February, of representatives from\r\nthe growing, shipping and marketing interests, the following\r\nrecommendations for greater uniformity in potato shipments were made:\r\n\r\n_Size._--Market stock of round white varieties shall be graded over a\r\nscreen which measures 1-7/8 inches in the clear. For long white\r\nvarieties a screen of 1-3/4 inches, in the clear, is recommended.\r\n\r\n_Weight._--Stock running over twelve ounces is undesirable and not over\r\nfive per cent. of this maximum weight should be allowed in first class\r\nshipments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure III. Burbank Russet.]\r\n\r\n_Quality._--Stock should be practically free from serious external\r\nimperfections, including late blight rot, common scab, sunburn, frost\r\ninjury, bruises, knobbiness, second growth, etc. Stock should be mature\r\nand clean.\r\n\r\n_Varietal purity._--Commercial potato shipments should be graded to one\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nAll indications show that Minnesota must grade and sort for commercial\r\nshipments of potatoes, and that a definite brand or grade designating a\r\ndefinite standard must be adopted in order to secure the highest prices.\r\nAll inferior stock must be thrown out, and the best potatoes given a\r\nchance to make an attractive showing.\r\n\r\nThe standing which Minnesota potatoes will have in the market will be\r\ndetermined a great deal by the grading, which is usually the work of\r\nthe dealer, although some farmers do their own grading by hand. Ungraded\r\npotatoes injure the Minnesota potato trade and reduce the profits, as\r\nthe freight is the same on dirt, small and unsound potatoes as it is on\r\nthe fine stock. As much as a ton of dirt and culls is sometimes found in\r\na car on the Chicago \"team tracks\" after the wholesale merchant has\r\nsacked all he is willing to accept. This freight, sorting charges and\r\ncost of disposing of refuse must be paid by some one. Co-operating to\r\nimprove the sorting done at loading stations is a means of establishing\r\na grade to meet competition and to reach new markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure IV. Early Ohio.]\r\n\r\nStandardization also means grading to eliminate potatoes infected with\r\ndisease, such as common scab and late blight, sunken discolorations or\r\ndry hard blisters, green, spongy and coarse stock. All of these defects\r\ntend to lower prices.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the value of the Minnesota potato we must also\r\nsupply the market with the variety which it demands, and, furthermore,\r\nthis variety must be free from mixture. Minnesota has already taken a\r\nstep in this direction. The Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nMinnesota Crop Improvement Association and the Minnesota Potato Growers'\r\nAssociation have recommended the following varieties and types to be\r\nselected and grown.\r\n\r\nThe Rural New Yorker, as shown in Figure 1, is the leading round, white,\r\nlate potato for Minnesota. It is a good yielding and keeping variety,\r\nfine in quality, an excellent market sort and suitable for almost any\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Rural New Yorker are the Carman No. 3 and Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh.\r\n\r\nThe Green Mountain is a desirable white late potato, similar to the\r\nRural New Yorker, but more oblong and with squarer ends. It is better\r\nsuited to rich heavy soils than the Rural New Yorker, as they are not so\r\nlikely to grow hollow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure V. Triumph.]\r\n\r\nOther similar varieties are the Carman No. 1, Green Mountain, Jr., and\r\nState of Maine.\r\n\r\nThe Burbank (Fig. II) is a long, white, late potato of excellent quality\r\nand suitable only for rich, loose, loam soils. Thrives well upon new\r\nrich soils that are well supplied with humus.\r\n\r\nOther inferior varieties confused with the Burbank are the White Chief,\r\nWhite Star and Pingree.\r\n\r\nThe Burbank Russet (Fig. III) is a long, russet, late potato differing\r\nmainly from the Burbank in its heavily russeted skin. Very fine for\r\nbaking. Suitable for low, moist, friable and peaty soils.\r\n\r\nThe Early Ohio (Fig. IV) is the leading early potato in Minnesota. The\r\ntype is oval with a pinkish or flesh colored skin. It is particularly\r\nsuited to the black, rich, friable soils.\r\n\r\nThe Triumph (Fig. V) is a round, red, very early potato, valuable for\r\nsouthern seed trade. It suffers severely from drought, and, therefore,\r\nsoils subject to this condition should be avoided.\r\n\r\nSimilar or identical varieties are Red Bliss, Bliss, Triumph and Stray\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Cobbler is a promising white, early, roundish potato of good\r\nquality, although inferior to the Early Ohio. It has not been\r\nsufficiently tested out, but is promising for southern seed trade.\r\n\r\nSimilar variety is the Extra Early Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe King is a broad, oblong, reddish potato. Very suitable for worn-out\r\nand sandy soils.\r\n\r\nSimilar or identical variety is the Maggie Murphy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would have you to remember the main points of this paper\r\nwhich may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst. That Minnesota is one of the leading potato producing states of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nSecond. That Minnesota must establish a reputation for a continuous\r\nsupply of well graded stock practically free from diseases and\r\nblemishes.\r\n\r\nThird. That Minnesota must create a general interest in better seed,\r\ntrue to name and type.\r\n\r\nFinally. Minnesota must secure the co-operation of all agencies\r\ninterested in the production, distribution and utilization of potatoes\r\nto get better production, better grading and better marketing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINSECTS HELP RAISE CROP.--It is well known that most of our\r\ncrop plants will not form fruit and seed unless the flowers are properly\r\npollinated. The principal carriers of pollen are wind and insects. In\r\nsome plants, such as the beet, both wind and insects play an important\r\npart in the spread of pollen. In all cereals and grasses, and in the\r\npotato, the pollen is carried mainly by wind. In most of our common\r\nplants of garden, field, and orchard, insects are the chief and most\r\neffective carriers of pollen. The following is a list of\r\ninsect-pollinated plants: Onions, asparagus, buckwheat, gooseberry,\r\ncurrant, cabbage, radish, turnip, raspberry, blackberry, strawberry,\r\napple, pear, plum, cherry, peach, alfalfa, clover, melons, cucumbers and\r\nsquashes. We are very dependent upon the bees and other insects for a\r\ngood crop yield.--W. W. Robbins, Colorado Agri. College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Eighth Congressional District.\r\n\r\nFRANK H. CUTTING, DULUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis district embraces within its limits a very large area having\r\ndifferent characteristics from a horticultural standpoint. Much of the\r\nland has a high elevation and is rolling or hilly, and much is low and\r\ncomparatively level. A considerable portion is close to Lake Superior\r\nand other large bodies of water and, therefore, governed by conditions\r\nwith respect to frost different from those controlling land not so\r\nsituated. The quality or character of the soil is also varying.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations probably furnish the reason for the widely\r\ndiffering reports secured on the blanks distributed, and which were\r\nquite generally answered. This prompts the suggestion that before\r\nplanting commercially or on a large scale one should personally conduct\r\na series of experiments on land designed for use to test its\r\nadaptability for the fruits intended.\r\n\r\nWe suffered a frost and hard freeze on the 18th day of May which greatly\r\ndamaged the fruit buds; the temperature registered on that day at the\r\nUnited States Weather Office being 27°. The month of June was the\r\ncoolest in forty-five years. The low temperature of the summer months\r\nand lack of sunshine resulted in a tardy development of fall fruits and\r\na failure to mature them. Even the Beta grape and the Compass cherry did\r\nnot ripen their fruit. The Opata plum, however, bore a large crop of\r\nripe plums early in September.\r\n\r\nVery little blight has been reported.\r\n\r\nThe weather report shows a deficiency of precipitation up to December 1\r\nof 3.81 inches. However, the heavy rains in November immediately before\r\nthe ground froze supplied sufficient moisture to enable trees and shrubs\r\nto stand the winter.\r\n\r\nThe following list is suggested by the reports:\r\n\r\nApples: Duchess, Okabena, Wealthy, Patten's Greening.\r\n\r\nCrab Apples: Florence, Early Strawberry, Virginia.\r\n\r\nPlums: Cheney, Aitkin, Compass, Opata.\r\n\r\nGrape: Beta.\r\n\r\nCherries: Reports generally unfavorable.\r\n\r\nBlackberries: No kinds reported favorably.\r\n\r\nRaspberry: Minnetonka Ironclad, King, Cuthbert, Older.\r\n\r\nStrawberries: Dunlap; Everbearing--Progressive and Superb.\r\n\r\nCurrants: Red Dutch, Perfection, Wilder, White Grape.\r\n\r\nGooseberries: Carrie, Houghton, Downing.\r\n\r\nHardy Perennial Flowers: Peonies, Phlox, Sweet William, Delphinium,\r\nCanterbury Bells, Foxglove, Oriental Poppies, Iceland Poppies.\r\n\r\nHardy Shrubs: Snowball, Hydrangea, Lilac, Honeysuckle, High Bush\r\nCranberry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Paynesville Trial Station.\r\n\r\nFRANK BROWN, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1915 will long be remembered as the summer with no warm\r\nweather. There was a heavy frost the morning of June 10th. The season's\r\nrainfall was very heavy, but trees at the best made only a normal\r\ngrowth, and with many varieties, especially of forest trees, the growth\r\nwas much less than the usual growth of even a dry season.\r\n\r\nSome fruit trees blossomed quite early, and the young fruit formed\r\nduring a warm spell, and these trees were heavily loaded with fruit.\r\nThis was especially noticeable with Wealthy, Duchess, Okabena and\r\nWhitney No. 20 apples, and with some of the Hansen hybrid plums. Other\r\ntrees, fully as good bearers, blossomed a few days later and set no\r\nfruit at all, the frost killing the blossoms while not severe enough to\r\nharm the fruit already set.\r\n\r\nThe cool weather of this past season has probably helped fruit growers\r\nmore than it has hindered them, for had it been as hot as it usually is\r\nwhen we have such a tremendous rainfall, blight would most certainly\r\nhave caused much trouble, but as it was we have had practically no\r\nblight at all.\r\n\r\nThis season has again demonstrated very plainly the advantages of\r\ntop-working, such trees making a better growth, and the fruit being more\r\neven, and less troubled with spots, scab, etc.\r\n\r\nThe plums sent to this station the spring of 1913 bore no fruit at all\r\nthis season, but the trees made a fair growth and all appear healthy\r\nexcept a few that froze back the winter of 1913-14.\r\n\r\nThe plum trees sent from the central station the spring of 1914 made a\r\nvery poor growth that season, owing undoubtedly to the fact that the\r\nroots were dry when reaching here, but this last season all but one made\r\na splendid growth, and one No. 10, to my surprise, produced five plums\r\nthat for beauty and eating qualities would place this variety in the\r\nfront rank with the best in the state. We shall watch these trees with\r\ngreat interest and will report on their actions as they develop.\r\n\r\nThe four trees of No. 1 plum, sent here the spring of 1915 from the\r\ncentral station, made a splendid growth, each tree developing fruit buds\r\nin abundance.\r\n\r\nOf the seven varieties of raspberries sent here the spring of 1913,\r\nthree made good this last season. No. 2 bore a tremendous crop of very\r\nlarge fruit, in quality the best; No. 4 bore heavily, an all around\r\ngood berry and apparently a good shipper; No. 7 produced a good crop,\r\nnot quite as large as No. 2, but continued in bearing for a long period.\r\nFurther testing will be necessary for these berries, but so far they\r\nlook good.\r\n\r\nThere is little to say about grapes, except the growth has been good,\r\nand the amount of fruit buds started immense, but the frost and\r\nunsuitable weather told the tale--we won't repeat it.\r\n\r\nOf strawberries we will say this: If the central station did nothing in\r\nfive years except to produce the strawberry known as Minnesota No. 3,\r\nthey have still done well. It is hardy, a good shipper, it is delicious\r\nwith cream and sugar, a good canner, in fact a great big Senator Dunlap\r\nwith no green core, but ripens to the tip. It is also a good plant\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry known as No. 1017, planted last spring, did well. It is a\r\nwonderful plant producer, having a very heavy, dark green foliage, it\r\nseems to be a good bearer of large, dark red berries.\r\n\r\nWith the wood on the fruit trees thoroughly ripened, and fruit buds in\r\ngood condition, we may look ahead to the future with courage, believing\r\nthat all things come to him that waits in Minnesota, providing he\r\nhustles while he waits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRED ROSE BEETLE IS EASILY KILLED.--Did you ever wait patiently\r\nin the spring for your favorite Japanese rose to bloom and find when the\r\nbuds were ready to burst that it was scaly and spotted around punctures\r\nmade by the red rose beetle? Then did you vow once more to destroy the\r\nbeetles when you saw the roses begin to wither from punctures made by\r\nthe beetle in the stem?\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the red rose beetle is simple, according to a\r\ncircular recently issued by the Minnesota state entomologist, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul. The method is to cultivate the ground around the rose\r\nbush early this spring and cultivate it again in the late fall. This\r\nwill destroy many of the beetles, for they live in the soil in the\r\nwinter. Then a few of the pests can be hand-picked and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf they are still too thick, they may be removed next fall for safety to\r\nnext year's blooms. The beetle lays its eggs in the hip of the rose.\r\nThese can be seen after the rose is in full bloom as a black spot,\r\ncovered over with no noticeable depression. The growing pests leave the\r\nold blossom by the middle of September and go into the soil until next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe bush should be examined in the latter part of August for any flower\r\nhips containing insect larvae and all found should be plucked and\r\nburned. A few hours' work will insure a beautifully blooming bush next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Jeffers Trial Station.\r\n\r\nDEWAIN COOK, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1915 apple crop at this station was a complete failure, owing to the\r\nfreezes of late May and early June. This apple failure, so far as I have\r\nbeen able to ascertain, was prevalent over the entire county of\r\nCottonwood, although we could hear of plenty of apples being grown only\r\na short distance over the county line in all directions excepting to the\r\nwest of us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A windbreak at Dewain Cook's, mostly white willow.]\r\n\r\nThe season has been one of cool weather and much rainfall, so much so\r\nthat although we had no killing frosts this fall until October 5th, yet\r\nno corn or melons ripened in this vicinity. We quit spraying our fruit\r\ntrees when the freeze came last spring and destroyed the apple crop, and\r\nthe result has been that there was much scab on the foliage of many\r\nvarieties of our apple trees. The Antonovka and the Hibernal seem to be\r\nabout the healthiest in this respect. As to the fire blight there has\r\nbeen absolutely none at this station the season just passed.\r\n\r\nAs for plums we got a few bushels in the final roundup, De Sotos, Wolfs\r\nand Wyants mostly. Of the Japanese hybrids, we got a few specimens of\r\nthe B.A.Q. The Emerald bore freely, but the fruit mostly either was\r\ndestroyed by the brown rot or cracked badly just as they were getting\r\nripe. The Tokata, one of Hansen's hybrids, gave us specimens of very\r\nfine fruit.\r\n\r\nOf the apricot hybrids only the Hanska made any pretense of trying to\r\nbear anything, but the curculio got away with about all of them.\r\n\r\nWhen I made the midsummer report most of Hansen's sand cherry hybrids\r\nwere promising a good crop, but with the exception of the Enopa and\r\nKakeppa, from which we gathered a few quarts of fruits, we got nothing.\r\nThe brown rot, assisted by the curculio, took them all. It sure looks\r\nas if we ever expect to make a general success with these sand cherry\r\nhybrids and with the Japanese hybrids, we will have to be better\r\neducated along the line of controlling this disease that is so very\r\ndestructive to the fruit of some varieties of plums, especially of those\r\nvarieties that have sand cherry or Japanese blood in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A veteran white spruce at Mr. Cook's place.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Specimen Colorado blue spruce at Dewain Cook's.]\r\n\r\nWe have to report a grand success with everbearing strawberry No. 1017,\r\nsent to this station from our State Fruit-Breeding Farm last spring. The\r\nseason all through was favorable for that class of fruit. We kept all\r\nblossoms picked off till about the first of August, when we let\r\neverything grow, and there is a great number of new plants. These new\r\nplants, with a few exceptions, did not bear, but the old plants, the\r\nones set last spring, we gathered from them, from about September 15\r\ntill the first hard frost, October 5th, a liberal crop of surprisingly\r\nfine fruit. The Americus, also an everbearing variety, treated exactly\r\nas we did Minnesota 1017, bore a great number of plants and some fruit\r\nin the fall. The berries were not so large as the 1017 nor so many of\r\nthem. While it is a perfect flowering variety, most of the late blossoms\r\nblighted, which seems to be a weakness of this variety.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th our strawberry beds were all given a mulching with loose\r\noat straw for a winter protection.\r\n\r\nThe several varieties of grape vines originating at the Minnesota State\r\nFarm on trial here have all made a vigorous growth. We have them all\r\npruned and laid on the ground, and we intend to give them no other\r\nwinter protection. They are in a sheltered location. In spite of the\r\nvarious freezes early in the season we got samples of fruit from most of\r\nthe varieties. Minnesota No. 8 seems to be the earliest to ripen its\r\nfruit. The wild grape flavor is noticeable in all these varieties.\r\n\r\nThe various varieties of plum trees sent here from the State Farm made\r\nvigorous growth the past season and are looking healthy with the\r\nexception of Minnesota No. 21. Of the five trees of this variety each\r\none has a great many galls on the body of the tree. It is probably what\r\nis termed black knot, only the galls have not turned black yet. They are\r\napparently of too recent growth for that. It is probable that we will\r\nplant other trees in their places next spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPAINTING OF SMALL TREE WOUNDS USELESS.--It has long been the\r\ncustom for horticulturists to recommend, and fruit growers to use,\r\ndressings of various kinds on the wounds of trees when branches are\r\nremoved in pruning. A few years ago the New York Experiment Station\r\ndecided to conduct some experiments to determine whether such practice\r\nwas really of any value or not.\r\n\r\nFrom results of this work, which have recently been published in\r\nbulletin form, it is concluded that the use of white lead, white zinc,\r\nyellow ochre, coal tar, shellac and avenarious carbolineum as coverings\r\nfor wounds under five inches in diameter is not only useless, but\r\nusually detrimental to the tree. This is particularly true of peaches,\r\nand perhaps of some other stone fruits, which, according to\r\nrecommendations, should never be treated at all.\r\n\r\nThe substances mentioned often injure the cambium layer to such an\r\nextent that the healing of wounds is greatly retarded. Of the substances\r\nexperimented with, white lead proved to be the best and is recommended\r\nwherever anything is used. But it is not thought worth while to use even\r\nwhite lead for wounds two or three inches or less in diameter, though it\r\nmay be advisable to use it on wounds where very large branches have been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nOn the larger wounds, where much surface is exposed to decay, the white\r\nlead will help to keep out moisture and the organisms which cause decay.\r\nThe smaller wounds, however, heal so quickly that the evil effects of\r\nthe covering may more than offset the benefits derived from its\r\nuse.--R.A. McGinty, Colorado Agricultural College, Fort Collins,\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Report, 1915, Montevideo Trial Station.\r\n\r\nLYCURGUS R. MOYER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-six years ago a plantation of white spruce was made at this\r\nstation. The trees flourished for several years and bade fair to become\r\na permanent success, but some six or eight years ago they began to fail\r\nand many of them have since died. The survivors are all in poor\r\ncondition. It seems that this tree is not well adapted to prairie\r\nconditions, at least not to the prairies of Southwestern Minnesota. Its\r\nnative range is much further north. Here it evidently suffers from heat\r\nand dryness. The Black Hills spruce is commonly regarded as belonging to\r\nthe same species. It has not been tested nearly so long, but so far it\r\nseems to be entirely hardy.\r\n\r\nSomething like thirty years ago a few trees of black spruce, a few trees\r\nof European larch and a few trees of balsam fir were planted here. They\r\nhave long since disappeared. White pine planted at about the same time\r\ndisappeared with them. A single tree of Scotch pine planted at about the\r\nsame time, standing in the open, is gnarled and crooked and shows a\r\ngreat many dead branches. A forest plantation of several thousand Scotch\r\npine, made something like twenty-two years ago, is still in good\r\ncondition. Many of the trees are from twenty-five to thirty feet high.\r\nSome of the smaller trees have been over-topped and smothered out, but\r\ngenerally the trees seem healthy. A few hundred of the black, or\r\nAustrian, pine were set at the same time. They are about two-thirds of\r\nthe height of the Scotch pine, but they are as healthy and vigorous\r\ntrees as one would care to see. Some trees of rock, or bull, pine (Pinus\r\nscopulorum) were set at the same time. They have grown at about the same\r\nrate as the black pine and are healthy, vigorous trees.\r\n\r\nNorway spruce has done better here than white spruce, some old trees\r\nfruiting freely. The Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens) seems to be\r\nour best spruce, and so far as tested the Black Hills spruce is a good\r\nsecond. Douglas fir has been planted in a small way in the parks, but it\r\nis young yet.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the Scotch pines in the forestry plantation owe\r\ntheir comparatively good condition to the shelter they get from the hot\r\nwinds from being planted close together, and from the fact that they are\r\npartly protected by the black pines planted to the west of them. The\r\nsingle tree of Scotch pine above referred to has had garden cultivation\r\nfor thirty years, but it seems likely that it was injured by the same\r\nhot winds that killed the white pine and the larch. The Scotch pine is a\r\nnative of Northern Europe, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Scotland, Normandy\r\n(near the ocean) and Germany and Russia around the Baltic, and all these\r\ncountries have a moist, cool climate. The black pine is a native of\r\nSouthern Europe, growing all the way from Southern Spain to the Taurus\r\nMountains in Asia Minor. In its native habitat it has become accustomed\r\nto the hot winds that often sweep across the Mediteranean, the burning\r\nsirocco of the Great Sahara. The dwarf mountain pine, Pinus Montana,\r\ngrows in the Pyrenees, in the Alps, in the Carpathians and in the Balkan\r\nMountains, so that it, too, often encounters the hot winds that come\r\nacross from the African deserts. It is probable that the ability of the\r\nblack pine, the dwarf mountain pine, the Black Hills spruce, and the\r\nrock pine to flourish on the prairies of Southwestern Minnesota is due\r\nto the fact that all these trees have become accustomed to resisting the\r\nhot, dry winds that often reach them in their native habitats.\r\n\r\nThe Norway spruce (Picea excelsa) in its many varieties is native to\r\nalmost the whole of Europe, extending from north of the Arctic Circle to\r\nthe Pyrenees and Balkan Mountains in Southern Europe. We could then\r\nexpect that trees from the Pyrenees or from the Balkans might be so well\r\naccustomed to the hot winds from Africa as to make them resist, at least\r\nfor some time, the hot winds of the prairies. And they do seem to stand\r\nbetter than the white spruce or the balsam fir or the white pine.\r\n\r\nSome report should be made on the material sent out for trial from the\r\nState Fruit-Breeding Farm. The strawberry, No. 1017, made a fine growth,\r\nand promised a large crop of fruit in September, but a few days of quite\r\ndry weather, following a very wet spell, ruined the crop at ripening\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry, No. 4, is a great producer of sprouts and multiplies\r\nenormously, but it seems to be a rather shy fruiter, and the fruit is\r\nnot of the highest quality. It is intermediate in season. No. 5 is a\r\nmuch larger and better berry, although not quite so hardy. Both came\r\nthrough the winter, without covering, in good condition. No. 8 seems to\r\nresemble the old Columbian. It does not sucker much. It is a large, late\r\nberry of good quality. It was covered, so its hardiness is untested.\r\nProf. Hansen's Oheta is a berry of much promise. It is of fine quality\r\nand fruits abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid plums were sprayed with a commercial dust spray but not\r\neffectively enough, for the fruit all rotted. We shall try more thorough\r\nspraying next season.\r\n\r\nPatten's Greening, Oldenburg, Okabena and Simbrish No. 1 produced a good\r\ncrop of apples. With us Okabena is undersized, of poor flavor and an\r\nextremely poor keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Growing of Vegetables for Canning.\r\n\r\nM. H. HEGERLE, PRES. CANNING FACTORY, ST. BONIFACIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state authorities, through the Agricultural Farm and other sources,\r\nare doing good work promoting and encouraging the growing of vegetables,\r\nbut it seems more could be done towards the marketing and conservation\r\nof these vegetables after they are grown.\r\n\r\nThe growing season for vegetables in this state is comparatively short,\r\nand although during that short period everybody eats vegetables, every\r\ngrocer's show windows, and even the sidewalks, are used to display them,\r\nand a tremendous business is done, yet there are tons and tons of nice\r\nfresh vegetables go to waste, not only for the market or truck farmer\r\nbut in every family garden--be the same ever so small, there is a steady\r\nwaste going on, all of which could easily be conserved _by canning_.\r\n\r\nCanning is simply putting the fresh vegetables in tin cans or glass jars\r\n(the latter are much more expensive, but no better), steaming and\r\nsealing them and setting aside until wanted. By doing this every truck\r\nfarmer, and any one having ever so small a garden, could conserve enough\r\nwhich otherwise would go to waste to keep them in real fresh vegetables\r\nall winter.\r\n\r\nOf course the thousands living in the cities having no garden can not do\r\nthis and are therefore dependent on the canning factory for their fresh\r\nvegetables, and here is where my topic comes in, _the growing of\r\nvegetables for canning_.\r\n\r\nIt is no trick to grow vegetables for home canning, any variety will do.\r\nYou need not select a big lot of one kind, and you need not sort for\r\nsize or color. Just take the surplus as you find it in your garden from\r\nday to day. All it needs is, it must be fresh and it must be thoroughly\r\nclean--but growing for the canning factory is different. To line up\r\nfifty to 200 growers to sow the same seed, to plant, harvest and bring\r\nto the factory just when in right condition, requires time and hard\r\nwork. This really is the hardest problem the canning factory has to\r\nsolve, and that is the reason why all successful canners grow at least\r\npart of their product.\r\n\r\nYou must remember vegetables put in cans will come out just as you put\r\nthem in. If you put in stale, tough, stringy beans you will be sure to\r\nfind them there when you open the can, but if you put in fresh, tender\r\nbeans, peas, corn or whatever else, you will find these exactly as you\r\nput them in, and it's immaterial whether you open this can the first,\r\nsecond or tenth year. We must not forget that vegetables properly\r\nsterilized and sealed will keep indefinitely, and they require no\r\npreservative of any kind. No canning factory uses any preservative, and\r\nno home cannery should use them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Upland Farm, St. Bonifacius, Minn.]\r\n\r\nThere was a time when canning was considered an art or a secret. I\r\nremember receiving circulars offering for sale the secrets of canning,\r\nand while in the grocery business some twelve years ago I sold thousands\r\nof packages of canning compound. These canning compounds, after a\r\nthorough examination by our State Food Department, were found not only\r\nworthless but harmful if put in canned foods.\r\n\r\n_Remember_, to can vegetables successfully, it requires no canning\r\ncompound or preservative of any kind, simply fresh and thoroughly clean\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nFresh vegetables are a good, healthy food, we all know this; and besides\r\nthey are cheaper than meat; therefore should be on our tables two or\r\nthree times a day. But mind you, they must be fresh, and while for some\r\nof us during the growing season it is comparatively easy to get them\r\nfresh, yet during the rest of the year, say eight to ten months, real\r\nfresh vegetables in bulk are hard to find and high in price. A lot of\r\nso-called fresh vegetables shipped in from a distance at best require\r\nseveral days to make the rounds through the grower, the shipper, the\r\njobber, the retailer--to our tables and are really not fresh. They have\r\nbecome stale, and by coming in contact with different kinds of material\r\nhave lost their delicate flavor. Therefore to insure real fresh\r\nvegetables for our tables, at least during the winter months, we must\r\ntake the canned article.\r\n\r\nAll of us remember how most everything in the grocery line was handled\r\nin bulk, dried fruits, cereals of all kinds, coffee, tea, etc., was\r\ndisplayed on the counters, along the aisles and even outside along the\r\nsidewalk, handled and examined by any one and exposed to dust and flies.\r\nJust about the same way are vegetables in bulk handled today. Where is\r\nthe grocer who would go back to those days, and where is the public that\r\nwould patronize him?\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: What vegetables do you can?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: We can corn; beans, string and wax; apples, tomatoes, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: How do you manage to get the farmers to bring them in? In\r\nWisconsin it was a failure. As you say, they came when they got their\r\nwork done, and the whole bunch came there at one time.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: That is the hardest work, to get the growers to bring the\r\nvegetables when they are in the right condition and when they should be\r\ncanned.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: There are five canning factories in that neighborhood now,\r\nand there isn't a one of them that allows the farmers to bring their\r\nstuff. They rent the farmers' land for themselves. For miles and miles\r\nyou can't find a farmer that hasn't rented his farm.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: You have to have the vegetables at the right time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: They use the farmer's team and give him all the assistance\r\nthey can. It does away with having them all at one time. I have seen\r\ntwenty-five farmers come at one time. I don't see how you manage it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: We have had a lot of trouble, and we are growing some of\r\nour vegetables.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: You can raise four successive crops of peas on the same\r\nground, and you can make that work all right. They used to can squash,\r\ncorn, tomatoes, and they have got down to peas entirely.\r\n\r\nA Member: Doesn't most of that trouble arise from the low prices?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: No, not entirely. The price when contracted is\r\nsatisfactory, and we find in our experience in growing our own\r\nvegetables we can grow them cheaper than what we pay to the growers. But\r\nwe wouldn't grow any if we could get the growers to bring them in when\r\nthey are in the right shape. When corn is at a certain stage to make a\r\ngood canned article it has got to be brought in that day, and if the\r\nfarmer don't bring it, if he has a state fair on or a wedding or a\r\nfuneral or something and delays it a day or two, then it is all off;\r\nthat corn is lost.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I would like to know which is the best beans for canning,\r\nthe yellow or the green?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Well, we prefer the Refugee, both in wax and green. We\r\nprefer them because they are the best in flavor we have.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Which is the best, the flat or the round of the wax?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Round is preferred by the trade, by the grocers or jobbers.\r\nI have kept the flat wax beans for my own use of those that we can.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Don't the flat ones bring a little more than the round ones?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Well, probably the first or second picking, but you can't\r\npick them as often as the other variety. The Refugee you can pick four\r\nor five or six times, and the flat beans can only be picked two times.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: I would like to ask what you pay for beans for canning\r\npurposes?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: We pay from 3/4 of a cent up to 4 cents a pound. Sometimes\r\na man brings in some that are almost too good to throw away, they are\r\nbig and stringy, and rather than send them home we think we have got to\r\ntake them and pay him something for them. We would rather not have them,\r\nand we usually dump them. Starting from that we pay up to three and four\r\ncents. Four cents for well sorted and mostly small beans. They have got\r\nto be graded, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Number 1 is the smallest, and they bring\r\nthe best price. We pay in proportion to the number 1's and 2's in the\r\nload.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What tomato do you find the best for canning?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Well, the Earliana.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Do you have any trouble with those bursting the cans?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: We had that trouble in canning for our own use. They burst\r\nthe can, they expanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: That is the fault of the man, not of the tomato.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: They were picked and canned the same day.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Probably not sterilized enough. Sterilizing fruit is the\r\nmain thing. A tomato is really one of the easiest things to can.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: In other tomatoes we don't have that trouble. It seems to\r\nhurt the sale of them to the women folks.\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Sterilize them a little more.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: About how long would you cook them?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: I am not the man at the wheel on that part. I don't know.\r\nWe have a superintendent that handles that part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop-Grafting.\r\n\r\nAN EXERCISE LED BY A. J. PHILIPS, WEST SALEM, WIS., AT 1915 ANNUAL\r\nMEETING OF THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: When I first talked top-working in Minnesota, Professor\r\nGreen and some of the knowing ones felt a little leary about it, but I\r\nkept right on just the same. The most I have got out of top-working is\r\nthe pleasure I have had, doing the work and seeing the fruit grow. I\r\ninherited a love for top-working from my father. He used to top-work\r\nsome, and after I began planting trees my old friend Wilcox used to come\r\nand visit me, and he was strong on top-working on hardy roots. I used to\r\nmake a little sport of the old man, but no more I guess than people have\r\nmade of me for doing the same thing. He made me a proposition about\r\nforty years ago. He says, \"You plant ten trees of a good variety to\r\ntop-work on--I will pick them out for you--and then you top-work them\r\nwith Wealthy, and then plant ten Wealthy trees right beside them on the\r\nsame land and in the same rows, right together, and see which will do\r\nthe best.\" At the end of ten years the Wealthy on their own roots had\r\nborne good crops but they began to fail, while the top-worked ones (on\r\nVirginia crab) were just at their best bearing at that time. Professor\r\nGreen came and looked them over at the end of fifteen years. The first\r\nten on their own roots were dead, and the others grafted on Virginia\r\nbore apples until they were twenty-five years old. That convinced me\r\nthat top-working in certain cases would pay if done on a hardy stock.\r\n\r\nI have seen a Northwestern Greening tree that was crotched, split apart\r\nand lay down when it was loaded with apples, in Waupacca County, but\r\nwhen grafted onto a stock whose limbs grew out horizontal it will carry\r\na load of fruit until it ripens without injury.\r\n\r\nI won a first prize at the Omaha exposition. My apples were not much\r\nbetter, but they were top-worked and were a little larger. I have some\r\nspecimens here that show the practical difference. These grew on my own\r\nland. I found in showing apples in Milwaukee at their fairs that I could\r\nalways get the best specimens from the top-worked trees. That convinced\r\nme that you could grow better fruit that way.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: What age do you commence the grafting?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I like to commence at two years old. I like to set a\r\nVirginia crab and let it grow one year and then commence top-working,\r\nand top-work about half the first year and the balance the second.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Is that in the nursery row?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: No, where I am going to have it grow. I have found the\r\nVirginia--and the Hibernal, too, either of them, very vigorous trees.\r\nThe Virginia is very vigorous. You dig up a Virginia tree, and you find\r\na great mass of roots; it has strength, and it grows fast. I have\r\ntop-worked about forty varieties on the Virginia and some on Hibernal.\r\nMr. Cady was there and looked it over, Prof. Green was there and Mr.\r\nKellogg has been there a number of times--and I always ask them this\r\nquestion: If they found any trees where the top had outgrown the stock?\r\nI have never seen an instance where the top of the tree put onto a\r\nVirginia crab outgrew the Virginia. I have some in my garden now where\r\nthe union is so perfect it takes a man with good eyesight to see where\r\nit is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.J. Philips, West Salem, Wis. Photo taken in his\r\neighty-second year.]\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: If you had Virginia trees twelve years old would you\r\ntop-work them?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Yes, sir, out towards the end of the limbs.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Suppose the limbs were too big on the stock you are going\r\nto top-work, how would you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I practice cutting off those larger limbs and letting young\r\nshoots grow. Mr. Dartt did a good deal of top-working, and he top-worked\r\nlarge limbs. I told him he was making an old fool of himself, but he\r\nwouldn't believe it. He would cut off limbs as large as three inches and\r\nput in four scions and at the end of two years they had only grown eight\r\ninches each. I have put in one scion in a Virginia limb that was about\r\n3/4-inch in diameter, and had it that season grow eight feet and one\r\ninch. That is the best growth I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe reason that my attention was called to the Virginia as being\r\nvigorous was, when I attended the meeting of this society about thirty\r\nyears ago--I think it was at Rochester--Mr. A. W. Sias, who was an active\r\nnurseryman and one of the pioneers of this society, offered a premium of\r\n$5.00 for the best growth of a crab apple tree, and then, in order to\r\nwin the money himself (which he did), he brought in some limbs of a\r\nVirginia that were six feet long that grew in one season; and I figured\r\nthen that a tree that could make that growth in one season was a\r\nvigorous tree, which it is. Nothing can outgrow it, and that was one\r\nreason why I commenced using it.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: I have one trouble in grafting the Wealthy to the Hibernal\r\non account of its making that heavy growth. I lost some of them by\r\nblight on that account.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Which was blighted, the Hibernal?\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: No, the Wealthy made such a big growth that it blighted. I\r\ncut the top back and put grafts in, and they made a good growth, but\r\nthey blighted. Did you have any trouble like that?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: No, sir, I think my soil is different from yours. My soil\r\nis of a poor order, a heavy clay, and it don't make the growth.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: How many of those large limbs could you cut off in one\r\nyear and graft?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Cut about half of the growth of the tree if not too large,\r\ndon't cut enough to weaken the tree too much. Next year cut the balance\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: In grafting, suppose you get scions from an Eastern state,\r\nwhat time would you get those scions, say, from Maine; Maine is on a\r\nparallel with Minnesota?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I prefer cutting scions in the fall before they freeze.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: How would you keep those scions?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I have tried a great many ways, in dirt and burying them in\r\nthe ground, but the best way to keep them is to put them in boxes and\r\nput some leaves among them. Leaves will preserve them all winter if you\r\nkeep them moist enough, wet them a little once in ten days just to keep\r\nthem damp. Leaves are a more natural protection than anything else.\r\nDon't you think so, Mr. Brackett?\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: What kind of a graft do you usually make?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I have put in some few whip-grafts but use the cleft-graft\r\nwith the larger limbs.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace: Is the Patten Greening a good tree to graft onto?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: It is better for that than most anything else where I live.\r\nIt is hardy and makes a good growth. If I had Patten Greenings, many of\r\nthem, I would top-work them. The apple is not a good seller where I\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What was the condition of that tree where Dartt put in four\r\nscions?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: They grew eight inches each in two years, then died. Those\r\nscions were too weak to take possession of the big limb. It is like\r\nputting an ox yoke onto a calf. They can't adapt themselves. They hadn't\r\nstrength to take hold of that limb and grow. That was a good\r\nillustration. Put a graft on a small limb, and it will assimilate and\r\ngrow better than if you take a large one.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Where you put in more than one scion in a limb, is it\r\nfeasible to leave more than one to grow?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: No, not if they grow crotchy. I let them grow one year to\r\nget firmly established and then I take off the lower one. I have trees\r\nin my garden I have done that with, and you couldn't see the crotch. It\r\ngrows right over.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: I have seen a great many of them where both of them were\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: It makes a bad tree, as bad as a crotchy tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Isn't it better to dehorn it and get some new shoots to\r\ngraft?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Yes, sir, and if they are _very old_ the best way is to set\r\nout new trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: In getting scions are there any distinguishing marks between\r\na vigorous scion and one not vigorous?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Nothing, only the general appearance. If I see a scion that\r\nlooks deficient I pass it by.\r\n\r\nMr. Erkel: Would it be practical to use water shoots for scions?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I should rather not. I have always had scions enough to\r\navoid using water shoots. They are an unnatural growth; I wouldn't use\r\nthem. Take a good healthy scion.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Would scions from bearing trees with the blossom buds on do\r\nyou any good?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Well, not with a blossom bud on; I wouldn't use such a\r\nscion. Some people say if you cut your scions from a bearing tree they\r\nwill bear quicker, but I never saw any difference.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this question has been asked a great many times by people,\r\nwhat age to plant a tree, whether it is best to plant young trees or\r\ntrees four or five years old, I will say I am in favor of young trees,\r\nand I am in favor of grafting a tree when it is young.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Isn't that a general opinion in the West where they make a\r\nbusiness of planting large orchards?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I think so. I think that is the case.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadoo: Can you graft onto a Martha crab and have success with that?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I never had very good success with the Martha crab; it\r\nisn't vigorous enough.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadoo: We had a tree twelve years and got seven apples.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Well, I think I got eight. (Laughter.) I believe with the\r\nMartha crab if you will plant it where there are other crab trees around\r\nit you get a pretty good crop, but not if you isolate it. I have an idea\r\nit is not self-fertilizing. I think that is the trouble with the Martha.\r\nIt is a nice crab.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: You showed the difference in size there, those top-worked\r\nand those not--don't you think that is because of cutting the top back?\r\nYou throw a heavy growth in there, which makes the fruit that much\r\nlarger?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Well, it might be.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: Have you had any experience in budding in August or first of\r\nSeptember on those trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Yes, sir, I do a little budding every year. Budding is a\r\nhard thing to do, that is, it is a particular thing to get the bud\r\nmatured enough and still have sufficient sap to slip.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: Would you put it on the top or bottom side of the limb?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I would put it on the upper side of the limb every time,\r\nbut I would put it a little further from the trunk of the tree than I\r\nwould to graft for the reason, if the bud fails you have two chances,\r\nand you have that same limb to cut off and graft next year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winesap apples top-worked on Peerless, grown at\r\nNorthfield, Minn.]\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I want to ask if it has a tendency to make the apple any\r\nearlier? Virginia crab is an early bloomer, and would grafting it with\r\nWealthy make it bloom earlier?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I hardly think so. I think it is a great deal as it was\r\nwith the man that had the boots. Some told him his boots would wear\r\nlonger if he greased them, and some one else told him they would wear\r\nlonger if he did not. So he greased one and not the other, and the one\r\nthat he greased wore fifteen minutes longer than the other. (Laughter.)\r\nI don't think it makes much difference. I tell you what it does do. You\r\ngraft a McMahon onto a Virginia and instead of having the McMahon its\r\nusual color, you will get a very nice blush on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Erkel: Is the Duchess a good stock to graft onto?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I haven't found it very good. It is hardly vigorous enough\r\nfor a stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Erkel: You mentioned Patten's Greening a few minutes ago. Isn't that\r\nconsidered a rather short-lived tree?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Not with me it hasn't been. I set some thirty years ago. I\r\nnever had a Patten's Greening injured with the cold. It is very hardy.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: How about the Brier's Sweet crab? I grafted some last year\r\nand had a larger percentage of the scions live on those than on the\r\nHibernal.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: You wouldn't get as good a growth afterwards. The scions on\r\nthe Virginia would grow better and have a better top. I don't think the\r\nBrier's Sweet is as vigorous as Virginia.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: I grafted on 120 Hibernals this spring and got hardly\r\none failure.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: You did good work.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Made a growth of three to four feet, some of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: That is good.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Clelland: Have you anything as good?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: If I had Hibernals I would graft them, but if I had to set\r\nsomething on purpose for grafting I would set Virginias. I have had\r\nbetter success with that variety for stocks.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Too big a growth on the graft is liable to be injured in\r\nthe winter, is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Too vigorous a growth on the tree is liable to get injured\r\nin the winter anyway. I like to see a good growth. I like to see it grow\r\nand then pinch it back in the fall. You can pinch it back a good deal\r\neasier when it has made a good growth than to make it grow big enough.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: I would like to know whether we should force all of the\r\ngrowth into the scion the first year where we graft on trees that have\r\nbeen set two years.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: One of the pleasures of doing top-working is to watch the\r\ngrowth of the grafts. I did a good deal of that on Sunday. You might do\r\nworse than communing with nature. You watch them same as you watch the\r\ngrowth of anything else, and if you think the graft is growing too fast\r\nlet some of the shoots on the stock grow to take part of the sap, but if\r\nyou think it is growing too slow and these shoots are robbing it, cut\r\nthem off. I like a good growth on grafts; it looks more like doing\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: But the second year would you keep all of the growth in the\r\ngraft?\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Yes, sir, the second year I would, and if it makes too\r\nlarge a growth pinch off the end. I put in some for a neighbor this\r\nseason, and I go down and see to them every two weeks. If I thought they\r\nmade too much growth in August I pinched them back so as to make them\r\nripen up quicker. I don't like to have them grow too late; as Mr.\r\nKellogg said, frost will get them. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpraying the Orchard.\r\n\r\nHON. H. M. DUNLAP, SAVOY, ILLS.\r\n\r\n(Continued from March No.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen just as soon as your bloom falls, just as soon as the blossom\r\npetals fall, then you want to spray again. You should use arsenate of\r\nlead along with your lime-sulphur in both sprayings, because your\r\narsenate of lead will take care of a great many insects that injure the\r\nfruit. The first spraying, immediately before the bloom, with arsenate\r\nof lead is for the curculio, what is called the Palmer worm, for canker\r\nworm--if you have any of them--the tent caterpillar, the leaf roller and\r\nvarious other insects that injure the fruit and the foliage. The spray\r\njust immediately after the bloom in addition to fungous is a codling\r\nmoth spray. To get rid of the codling moth worm you use the arsenate of\r\nlead. The codling moth egg hatches shortly after the bloom falls, and\r\nthe little worm instinctively goes into the blossom end of the apple,\r\nbecause that is the only place it can enter the apple at that particular\r\ntime. Just why it does not enter on the side of the apple I can not say,\r\nbut there is a little fuzz on the outer side of the apple at that stage\r\nof growth that perhaps prevents their getting in, and that fuzz as the\r\napple grows larger disappears, so a little later they can enter on the\r\nside or at any other part of the apple that they choose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. H. M. Dunlap, Savoy, Ills.]\r\n\r\nWhen the blossoms fall the apples stand upright on the tree, and the\r\nlittle pointed leaves that are on the blossom end of the apples, that we\r\ncall the calyx, are all open, and at that time you can spray so as to\r\nget the arsenate of lead on the inside. Within a week or ten days after\r\nthe bloom falls these sepals, or little leaf points, gradually close\r\ntogether until they are all closed up tight, and after that you can't\r\nget your spray in there. After the worm hatches he gets between the\r\nlittle leaves of the calyx and goes on the inside of the apple and into\r\nits center. You want to have your poison ready for Mr. Worm when he\r\nenters the blossom end of the apple, and the more thoroughly and more\r\neffectively you spray the better are the results.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if you spray thoroughly at that time, that that is\r\nthe only spray you really need for the codling moth worm. I don't agree\r\nwith that, as there is always a second brood of worms. I use the\r\narsenate of lead along with the lime-sulphur for all these sprays,\r\nbefore the bloom and after the bloom, and if you don't spray more than\r\nthree times you will be doing yourself a good service, and it will well\r\npay you. In some parts of the country they spray as high as seven or\r\neight times in the commercial orchards, but I would say in a farmer's\r\norchard three times would be enough, once before the bloom and twice\r\nlater, and you will notice the good results.\r\n\r\nThere are other sprays besides these, but none perhaps of any importance\r\nto you up here except the winter spray for the San Jose scale, if you\r\nhave that, and I noticed one or two specimens out there that seemed to\r\nhave the scale upon them. That spray should be done either in the fall\r\nor early winter or late winter while the trees are dormant. That has to\r\nbe put on of winter spray strength, using lime-sulphur or some of the\r\nother San Jose scale sprays without the arsenate of lead, as you don't\r\nneed to use the lead with this spray.\r\n\r\nNow, as I stated to start with, these remarks ought to be appropriate to\r\nyour needs and to make them so it would be a good deal better for me to\r\ngive you the opportunity of asking questions or of discussing this\r\nquestion of spraying yourselves rather than for me to go into this\r\nsubject any further and not know just exactly what you would like to\r\nlisten to. If you have any questions to ask I would be glad to answer\r\nthem if I can.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: What proportion of the lime-sulphur and arsenate of lead do\r\nyou use?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: If we get the commercial brand of lime-sulphur we use it in\r\nthe proportion of three gallons of that commercial mixture to 100\r\ngallons of water and for the arsenate of lead in the same spray tank at\r\nsame time we use four pounds of arsenate of lead to the 100 gallons.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: Have you ever carried over lime-sulphur from one year to\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Yes, sir, we often do that, carry it over until the next\r\nyear. It wants to be kept where it will not freeze.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: Is there much danger of evaporation so it would be too\r\nstrong to use next year?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Your barrel should be kept bunged tight.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Mr. Dunlap fails to say anything about dormant sprays.\r\nDon't you use dormant sprays?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I was just speaking about the dormant or winter spray. When\r\nyou spray in the winter time use lime-sulphur or scalicide.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Another thing: I take a little exception to what Mr.\r\nDunlap says in advocating buying a spraying machine collectively in the\r\nneighborhood, for the simple reason that it is necessary to spray at one\r\nparticular time, at the vital time just before the blossoms fall and at\r\nthe time they have fallen. We have found it almost impossible to do any\r\nspraying for anybody except ourselves at that time. We talked that\r\nmatter over before we bought spraying machines.\r\n\r\nYou said you wondered whether there were any apples grown here\r\ncommercially. Out of our town we shipped this year eight car-loads of\r\napples. We have three power sprays in our orchard, and we talked that\r\nmatter over before we bought them, about buying collectively, and we\r\ndecided it was absolutely impossible to do it. I don't think it is\r\nfeasible for a small grower to depend on that kind of thing because he\r\nmay be disappointed. My theory is for each one to have his own sprayer,\r\nlarge or small. Another thing, we find a pressure of 200 pounds is\r\nbetter than spraying without that pressure; we get better results.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: The gentleman misunderstood me. I said where you have just\r\nsmall orchards you could do it collectively. Of course, I do not\r\nadvocate where a man has enough to have use for a spray machine for his\r\nown orchard that he get one collectively. That would be a great mistake,\r\nbut where a man has only fifty trees in a neighborhood where there are\r\nno big orchards, it would be better for a dozen or more to combine. If\r\nyou can get around with it in a week you will be all right but not\r\nlonger than that.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I beg to differ with you just the same. I think if you\r\nwant to spray you must spray at the time; it might rain the next day,\r\nand you might miss the whole season.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: There are a good many people who don't like to go to the\r\nexpense of a spray machine just for fifty trees or 100 trees. If they\r\nwould combine with a few neighbors they would do some spraying work,\r\notherwise they wouldn't do any at all. If a man will buy a machine and\r\ndo his own spraying, why, that is certainly the best thing to do, but if\r\nhe won't do that it is better to combine with his neighbors and do it\r\nthan for none of them to do it. Community spraying is the best thing to\r\ndo if you have only small orchards.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: What pressure would you recommend in spraying for codling moth\r\nwhere arsenate of lead is used?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: You can do effective spraying all the way from sixty pounds\r\nto 200 pressure. My preference is about 150 pounds. I have known\r\ninstances where considerable injury was done by using too high pressure.\r\nWe have sprayed at 225 pounds, but we have given that up. It is not as\r\ngood as from 150 to 175 pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I would like to know about what quantity of arsenate of lead\r\nand lime-sulphur combined would you recommend? How much of each?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: In 100 gallons of water we put three gallons of the\r\nconcentrated solution of lime-sulphur, as we buy it commercially, three\r\ngallons to 100 gallons of water, that is, for the summer spray, and for\r\nthe arsenate of lead we use four pounds of arsenate of lead to the 100\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: In connection with that I would like to ask if you have used\r\nor would recommend pulverized lime-sulphur?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I haven't used any.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: Do you know anything about it?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I think it is a more expensive proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer: I never used any myself. I thought perhaps that might work\r\nbetter in connection with the arsenate of lead than the liquid.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I couldn't say, I have always followed the policy of never\r\ndeparting from well-established lines of work until I am satisfied that\r\nthe new one is absolutely all right. I have seen in our state men\r\ndestroy the fruit from a forty or eighty acre orchard by taking up some\r\nnew thing that was highly advertised and looked very attractive. It is\r\nnot the same proposition, of course, but they tell us the devil comes in\r\nvery attractive form. He comes with a swallow-tail coat and a red\r\nnecktie and a buttonhole bouquet, and he looks very attractive. So it is\r\nwith a lot of these things advertised; they look attractive but for our\r\nown good we ought to stick to the things we know and let the state\r\nexperiment station try them and report upon them.\r\n\r\nMr. Huestis: Does Mr. Dunlap attribute the general dropping of apples to\r\nthe scab fungus?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Not entirely.\r\n\r\nMr. Huestis: Do you think that it weakens the stem of the apples?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Yes, sir, the droppings of the apple is largely due to the\r\nscab fungus. Of course, some of the dropping occurs as the result of too\r\nmuch rain or too much dry weather, something of that kind, that is not\r\nattributable to scab fungus.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Does spraying injure the bees?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I have never had anybody prove to me that the bees were\r\nespecially injured by spraying in the bloom. We do not practise spraying\r\nin the bloom, that is, we spray when we have about one-third of the\r\nbloom left on the trees. I have never had any injury, and we have\r\norchardists who have bees in their orchards, and they go on spraying the\r\nsame way. I do not believe bees are poisoned by the spray. Maybe I am\r\nmistaken about it, but I have never seen any conclusive proof of the\r\nbees being poisoned by the spray. It is possible they might collect it\r\nand carry it into the hives and might poison the brood in the hive. I\r\ndon't know. I thank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Value of Horticulture to the Farm.\r\n\r\nMRS. CLARENCE WEDGE, ALBERT LEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to have a good roomy subject. E. S. Martin said in\r\nHarper's Weekly as Christmas time approached, \"There are just two places\r\nin the world, and one of these is home.\" I will paraphrase it by saying,\r\n\"There are only two places in the world, and one of these is the farm.\"\r\nSo the value of horticulture to the farm is a large subject.\r\n\r\nI passed a farm last summer that I shall never forget. It was quite\r\nunattractive, I believe, so far as variety of contour was\r\nconcerned--quite level and commonplace. Right across the road from the\r\nhouse was a half-grown windbreak of golden willow. Against that as a\r\nbackground blazed out row upon row of the most brilliant flowers,\r\ngraduated down to the edge of the road, and extending as far as half a\r\ncity block or more. Think what a beautiful surprise for every one that\r\nturned that corner. I think the occupants of the house must have enjoyed\r\nsitting on their porch watching the people in the cars start with\r\npleasure and turn to look as they flew past. That farmer (or his wife)\r\nknew something of the value of horticulture to the farm. Perhaps it was\r\na device of the farmer's wife to divert the gaze of the passer-by from\r\nthe porch, for you know we do stare shamelessly when we are on a joy\r\nride. At any rate, that farm would not be forgotten by any one that\r\npassed it. The advertising that beauty spot gave his place would exceed\r\nin value a column a week in the county paper, and not cost a tenth as\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nLowell remarks, \"Nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare.\"\r\nAnd there she stands with arms extended, offering the farmer all the\r\nwealth and beauty he will put forth his hand to take.\r\n\r\nLast fall I passed another farm down in Iowa, whose owner had tried to\r\nmake his place conspicuous by putting a concrete wall and gateway in\r\nfront of his house, and making lavish use of white paint in decorating\r\nhis buildings and grounds. He succeeded, but I cannot help thinking that\r\nif he had put the money that useless concrete work cost into shrubbery\r\nand vines, it would have made his place twice as attractive. I dislike\r\npretentious adornments to the farm, especially where the rest of the\r\nplace doesn't measure up to them. Like Senator Blaine, who, at the time\r\nthe Queen Anne style of architecture became popular, on being asked why\r\nhe did not have his old fashioned house Queen Anned, replied that he\r\ndid not like to see a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back.\r\n\r\nA farm home can be something better than a city park. One of the\r\nbeautiful things that I shall always remember about Berlin was a way\r\nthey had of bordering their parks and the enclosures of public\r\nbuildings. They take tree-roses trimmed up to the height of a fence with\r\na hemispherical head. Then they plant them around the edge of their\r\ngrounds a rod or two apart, festoon chains from the top of one rose\r\nstalk to the top of the next, and where the chain touches the ground\r\nmidway between them, they plant a little ivy which climbs up and\r\nconceals the chain and gives the appearance of festoons of vines between\r\nthe rose trees. I thought them so lovely that when I married a\r\nnurseryman I thought I would persuade him to do something of that kind\r\non our grounds, but he has convinced me that while that is all right for\r\na city park, it would not be in good taste in a country place. It would\r\nlook too artificial. The charm of a country place is its natural beauty.\r\nFor the same reason we do not have any trimmed evergreens or hedges on\r\nour place. Moreover, the man who makes his living from the soil finds\r\nthe upkeep of those decorations too pottering, and if he had money to\r\nhire it done he would rather put it into his automobile or into other\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe natural beauty that can be set about the farm home will become it\r\nbetter. Wild grape vines or woodbine draping the wire fences tempt the\r\neye of the passer-by to linger, and they cost nothing. Once planted,\r\nthey are there for a life-time. A walnut tree in a fence corner will\r\ngrow to a fair size in ten years, in twenty it becomes a land-mark. A\r\ncatalpa of a hardy strain will do the same thing in about half the time\r\nin our part of the state. Take an elder from your woods and plant it in\r\nan angle of your house, and it makes a luxurious growth that rivals the\r\ncastor bean of the city park and does not need to be replaced the next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIt certainly pays to go in for some kind of horticultural adornments for\r\nthe farm. They are so easy and inexpensive to obtain and make such a\r\nhappy difference to the farmer's family and to all who pass his way.\r\nWhen you have a specially prosperous year on the farm, save a little of\r\nthe surplus for new trees or shrubs.\r\n\r\nBut I remember passing another farm, all of twenty-five years ago, where\r\nhorticulture may once have been of value to the farmer but had become a\r\nburden to him. There was a dense grove of willow down at one side,\r\nthrough which the drive leading to the barn was kept wet and muddy by\r\nthe shade. On the other side rose a high grove of trees casting a gloomy\r\nshade on the house and poultry buildings, and a few odd shrubs straggled\r\nalong the roadside and gave the place an unkempt look. Of all things,\r\nhave sunshine! City people often have to sacrifice it, but no farmer is\r\ntoo poor to have it in plenty. Don't let your trees tyrannize over you.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, unnecessary to mention the value of a windbreak to a\r\nfarm. If it has not been provided by nature it is an absolute necessity\r\nto plant one as a matter of economy. It saves fuel inside and gives\r\ncomfort outside. The cows give more milk, and all the animals put on\r\nmore fat, if they have a sheltered place to take their airing. It is\r\nalso a good thing to set some bushes or small spruces along the\r\nfoundation wall of the house on the windy side. They are ornamental in\r\nsummer, and in winter they catch the snow and tuck the house in against\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the garden, the \"Value of Horticulture to the Farm\"\r\ndepends largely upon the farmer's wife, for a garden needs mothering as\r\nwell as fathering. Few farmers have time to do more for a garden than\r\nthe actual labor of plowing, planting, and cultivating, and digging the\r\nroot vegetables in the fall. Somebody must watch the garden, go through\r\nit nearly every day, poison the cabbage worms and potato bugs, keep the\r\nasparagus and cucumbers picked, watch for the maturing of peas and\r\nbeans, and dispose of any surplus either by canning or sending to\r\nmarket. To visit the garden only when you wish to gather some particular\r\nvegetable is like milking the cow only when you happen to want some\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nA garden well tended puts the farm far ahead of the city home for\r\nluxuries of the table and cuts the cost of living in two. Fresh\r\nvegetables and cream are expensive articles in the city, inaccessible to\r\nany but the well-to-do, but it does not take a very thrifty farmer to\r\nhave them, providing he has a thrifty wife. But to be a real helpmeet\r\nshe must have an overall skirt and a pair of rubber boots. Then the dewy\r\nmornings will be as much of a pleasure to her as to her husband, and she\r\ncan do her garden work in the cool of the day.\r\n\r\nA garden is especially valuable to a farm, because the farm is usually\r\nsomewhat isolated and must depend more or less upon its own resources\r\nfor freshness and variety of food. A good garden on the farm will almost\r\nabolish the tin can, and strike off a large part of the grocer's bill,\r\nto say nothing of making the farmer live like a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry Weevil.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs strawberries are about to blossom, it would be well to keep a\r\nlook-out for a shortage in the number of blossoms, for this is the first\r\nindication of the work of the strawberry weevil. Because of the\r\ndiminutive size of the insect, few are acquainted with it, so that the\r\nshortage of blossoms or failure of the crop is often attributed to\r\nfrost, hail, climatic conditions or some other agency. Upon close\r\nexamination, the buds will be found to be severed from the stem, some\r\nlying beneath on the ground, others being still attached by a few shreds\r\nin a drooping manner. Further examination around the buds may reveal a\r\nsmall snout beetle, which is the cause of the injury, it being about\r\none-tenth inch long and marked with two dark spots on each wing cover.\r\nThe females oviposit in the buds, and then cut them off when oviposition\r\nis completed, in order to protect the larva within, which later develops\r\nto the adult beetle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing beetle of strawberry weevil and the damage it\r\ninflicts.]\r\n\r\nThe strawberry weevil has been especially injurious around the vicinity\r\nof Hopkins the past summer. It was not uncommon to find fields with from\r\nforty to ninety per cent. of the buds cut, and as the earliest and most\r\nmature buds, which would be the first to ripen, are among those cut,\r\nthe losses inflicted may be quite serious. The weevil not only injures\r\nthe cultivated strawberry, but is found to attack the buds of the red\r\nraspberry, dewberry and wild strawberry. It is a singular fact that only\r\nthe staminate varieties are injured, especially those which furnish\r\nconsiderable pollen, since this constitutes the chief food supply of\r\nboth larvae and adults.\r\n\r\n_Life History._--The weevil appears as soon as the buds begin to form\r\nand soon after deposits an egg within the bud. She then immediately\r\ncrawls down the stem and proceeds to sever the bud. The eggs hatch\r\nwithin five or six days, and in about three or four weeks the footless\r\ngrubs become full-grown, coming out as adults about five days later.\r\nThis new brood, upon emerging, will attack the leaves, making numerous\r\nsmall holes on the under surface, soon after picking time. As early as\r\nAugust 25 the beetles were found to go into hibernation last summer,\r\nwithin the strawberry fields, being found especially among the dead\r\nleaves. The older beds were found to be more seriously infested because\r\nof the fact that they wintered over in the small fields.\r\n\r\n_Control._--Since the weevils do not disperse readily, and since they\r\nhibernate within the fields, the one crop system and the plowing up of\r\nthe beds immediately after picking would probably do away with the\r\ninjury entirely. This one crop system could be followed for about two\r\nyears, when it might be advisable to return to the two crop system if\r\nthe weevils have disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1916, the weevils were located by the writer underneath the\r\nstraw, and beginning to move about. From observations last year, it\r\nwould be advisable to remove the straw from one or two rows in order to\r\nhasten the maturity of the buds, and keep the straw on the remainder of\r\nthe patch in order to force the weevils to the uncovered row. They could\r\nthen be destroyed either by plowing under or burning.\r\n\r\nSome recent experiments by Prof. Headlee, State Entomologist of New\r\nJersey, appear to have been successful against the strawberry weevil. A\r\ndust spray of a mixture of arsenate of lead one pound, and sulphur one\r\npound, was used as a repellent, giving almost perfect protection. The\r\nmaterial was applied twice, April 30th and May 6th.\r\n\r\nThe writer will be glad to co-operate with the growers, if they find the\r\npresence of the weevil in their strawberry beds.--S. Marcovitch, Section\r\nof Economic Entomology, Division of Economic Zoology, University Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary's Annual Report, 1915.\r\n\r\nA. W. LATHAM, SECRETARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years is a long time to look forward to, but it does not\r\nseem so long when you look back, and yet when I review the changes that\r\nhave taken place in the Horticultural Society since I assumed the\r\nposition of secretary twenty-five years ago the way seems long indeed.\r\nIn the year 1890 very nearly all of the old members of the society,\r\nthose who had contributed their time and money to bring it into\r\nexistence and keep it alive for its first twenty-four years were still\r\non the membership roll and doing loyal work for the association. As year\r\nby year passed these veterans of the association one by one dropped away\r\nuntil at the present time the number of those in that class who are\r\nstill with us here are so few in number that it becomes almost a\r\nvanishing point. In the year 1897 a photograph was taken of \"ten\r\nveterans of horticulture,\" a copy of which is hanging in the secretary's\r\noffice, and of these ten the only one now with us is that loyal friend\r\nand supporter of the society, Seth H. Kenney, of Waterville, now eighty\r\nyears of age and too feeble to attend this meeting. Going back to a date\r\nstill earlier, covering the first few years of the association, the only\r\nworking members of the society as far as the secretary recalls are J. M.\r\nUnderwood, C. M. Loring and himself. This is the order of nature, and we\r\nshould remember only with gratitude and affection those who have served\r\nbefore us and with us and passed on.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this, the forty-ninth year of the society, we find the\r\nmembership roll somewhat larger in number than at any previous period in\r\nits history, there being on the annual roll 3,079 members, and on the\r\nlife roll 311 members, of whom 30 are honorary. There have been added to\r\nthis roll the past year one honorary life member, Mr. Lycurgus R. Moyer,\r\nof Montevideo, and 20 paid life members. The number of deaths appearing\r\non this life roll during the past year is fortunately only two, Mr. E. A.\r\nWebb, editor and manager of \"The Farmer,\" who had been a member since\r\n1906, and V. A. Neil, of Minneapolis, whose death occurred prior to the\r\n1914 annual meeting but had not been spoken of heretofore.\r\n\r\nAs usual a considerable number of sources have contributed towards this\r\nlarge membership roll. The auxiliary societies, of which there are 10\r\nhave brought upon this roll in all 878 members. One new auxiliary\r\nsociety has been added to the number this year, organized in St. Paul\r\nunder the name of \"Horticultural, Poultry and Improvement Association of\r\nWest St. Paul.\" An auxiliary society maintained at Crookston for a\r\nnumber of years seems to be no longer in existence and should probably\r\nbe taken from the list of auxiliaries. The farmers' institutes have not\r\ncontributed as largely to the membership roll as some previous years, on\r\naccount in part of the fact that the work heretofore done by farmers'\r\ninstitutes is being done in farmers' clubs and schoolhouse meetings of\r\nfarmers, which does not offer as good an opportunity for securing\r\nmemberships, though the service to the cause of horticulture is probably\r\neven better. Through this source the society has received this year 146\r\nmemberships. Many of the nurserymen have contributed liberally to the\r\nmembership this year, memberships that were given by them to their\r\ncustomers in accordance with an arrangement made with this office. In\r\nall from this source have come upon our roll 172 memberships.\r\n\r\nThe State Fruit-Breeding Farm continues to be the object of permanent\r\ncentral interest in our association. Unfortunately the frosts of last\r\nspring interfered with the fruiting of the thousands of trees which\r\nunder other circumstances would have borne fruit, many of them for the\r\nfirst time, so that practically few advances have been made the past\r\nyear in breeding new tree fruits except in preparation for the future.\r\nIn small fruits it was different, and the list of these worthy of trial\r\nwhich are standing the climate well is a growing one. Our membership are\r\nexceedingly interested in these new fruits as manifested by the large\r\nnumber called for through the distribution of plant premiums. In all\r\nthere were sent out this year 2,594 lots of these plant premiums.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing interest in top-grafting late-keeping varieties of\r\napples as indicated by the large number of calls made on this office for\r\nscions for this purpose the past season.\r\n\r\nThe seedling contests continue and the interest in growing seedlings\r\ncontinues as well, there having been a call during the past year from\r\nthis office for a considerable number of packages of apple seeds by our\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nSo far no apple seedling has appeared to which we could award the $1,000\r\nprize offered by the society for a winter apple. Referring to the\r\nseedling contest inaugurated some years ago, the first $100 premium in\r\nconnection with which should have been awarded three years ago, it\r\nappears that the time limit for the fruitage of these seedlings was\r\nmade too short. The fourth premium comes due at this meeting, but no\r\nclaimants have as yet come forward for any of these premiums. Probably\r\nit will be thought a wise thing to do to continue these awards during\r\nlater years when these seedling trees will come into bearing.\r\n\r\nThe \"acre orchard\" contest entered into a year ago last spring in which\r\nthere 35 entries finally materialized into a smaller number than\r\nanticipated, reports having come into the office last year from 23\r\ncontestants. The reports for the current year are now being received but\r\nnot all at hand.\r\n\r\nThe executive board provided conditions under which these orchards\r\nshould be conducted and the prizes awarded, which conditions will be\r\nfound published in the 1914 report of the society on page 45.\r\n\r\nTrial stations are continuing their work and are being used principally\r\nnow as far as new material is concerned in testing of fruits from the\r\nState Fruit-Breeding Farm. To this list has been added the government\r\nstation at Mandan under the management of A. W. Peterson, reports from\r\nwhich point will also be made to our association from time to time, as\r\nwell as from the trial stations connected with University Farm, all of\r\nwhich stations have been added also to our society list.\r\n\r\nArrangements are being perfected for the purpose of extending to our\r\nmembership opportunity to use the books from the society library, which\r\nis now increased to about 3,300 volumes. This list has been published in\r\nthe 1915 report of the society, and we shall be prepared early in the\r\nyear to send out books to all who desire them according to the\r\nregulations, which will be published in an early number of our monthly.\r\n\r\nThe society is maintaining its card indexes and adding year by year to\r\nthe amount of material which they represent. One of these cards indexes\r\ncontains the names and titles of all the articles published in the\r\nsociety's annual reports and is indexed also with the names of the\r\nwriters, the index being prepared in this double manner. Another card\r\nindex contains the list of books in our library, and the third one,\r\nindexed by subjects, the bulletins on horticulture coming from the\r\nvarious state experiment stations and the U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture. These indexes are invaluable for their various purposes and\r\nmay be used by the membership at their volition.\r\n\r\nThe society maintained an office at the late state fair, at which a\r\nconsiderable number of memberships were received and a large number of\r\nmembers met by the secretary and other officers of the society. We\r\nbelieve this was an excellent move and should be continued in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAs to the horticultural exhibit at the state fair, while the secretary\r\nhas no official connection with it, it should be spoken of as a very\r\nsatisfactory exhibition indeed and well handled. The building as a\r\nwhole, covering all branches of horticultural work, was a real credit to\r\nthe various interests represented and well deserves all the time and\r\nexpense lavished upon it.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important event of the year with which the secretary\r\nwas officially connected was the effort made to secure an appropriation\r\nfrom the state legislature in session last winter for the construction\r\nof a building for the uses of the Horticultural Society. The building\r\ncommittee, with which the secretary served, held a number of meetings\r\nwith members of the Board of Regents and various committees at the state\r\nlegislature, at which a considerable number of our membership besides\r\nthose regularly on the committee were in attendance and took part in\r\nappeals in the interest of the building. The secretary's service in this\r\nconnection was largely the effort made to enlist the co-operation of the\r\nmembership in the way of getting them to write letters or talk\r\npersonally with the members of the legislature upon the subject, and an\r\nappeal was sent out through the mails to all of our membership with this\r\nobject in view. The response was a most liberal one, far beyond our\r\nexpectations. Some of the members of the legislature received over\r\nthirty letters from their constituents asking their support to this\r\nmeasure. There was not a single member of the legislature who did not\r\nreceive some communications about this matter. In all there were sent in\r\nthis manner to members of the legislature 1,594 letters. While our\r\nefforts to secure this building failed, it was, as we believe, largely\r\non account of the prevailing and unusual sentiment for economy which\r\npermeated the legislature to an extraordinary degree, and we have\r\nreasonable assurance that a similar effort with the next legislature\r\nwill bring us success. In regard to this matter the chairman of the\r\nbuilding committee speaks more fully.\r\n\r\nThe financial report follows and to this your attention is respectfully\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary's Financial Report, 1915.\r\n\r\nA.

It must\r\nbe remembered, too, that in Shakespeare's time herbs and wild flowers\r\nwere cultivated in most gardens, that many considered beautiful then are\r\nnow almost forgotten, and that some have been so far surpassed by their\r\nimproved hybrids, the originals would not now be cultivated.\r\n\r\nWe have not attempted, therefore, to include all of the flowers so\r\nlovingly mentioned by the poet, but have used only those that will prove\r\nbeautiful and hardy in Minnesota, making a planting that will prove,\r\nwith proper care, permanent. Were each plant labeled with its proper\r\nquotation the garden would prove much more interesting, e.g., \"There's\r\nrosemary, that's for remembrance--\" Hamlet, marking the plant of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\n_Annuals._--Gillyflowers (Ten weeks' stocks); Love in Idleness (Pansy,\r\nViola tricolor); Mallow (Lavatera splendens); Marigold (Calendula\r\nofficinalis); Poppy (Somniferum, Opium poppy).\r\n\r\n_Trees._--Hemlock, Hawthorne.\r\n\r\n_Vines._--Honeysuckle, Scarlet Trumpet.\r\n\r\n_Bulbs._--Scilla Nutans (Hyacinthus nonscriptus); Daffodils; Saffron\r\n(Crocus santious); Crown Imperial (Frittilaria Imperialis); Lily,\r\nCandidum, Turk's Cap (Scarlet Martagon), Orange Lily (Croseum),\r\nSpectabile, Tigrinum.\r\n\r\n_Herbs._--Balm (Lemon Balm); Camomile (Anthemis); Caraway; Dian's Bud\r\n(Wormwood, Artemisia Absinthium); Fennel (Foeniculum officinalis);\r\nHyssop (Hyssopus officinalis); Lavender (Lavendula vera); Marjoram\r\n(Origanum vulgare); Mint; Milfoil (Yarrow); Parsley; Rosemary\r\n(Rosmarinus officinalis); Rue (Ruta graveoleons); Savory; Thyme (1,\r\nThymus vulgaris, 2, Thymus Serpyllum).\r\n\r\n_Perennials._--Aconite (Napellus); Balm (Bee-balm); Brake; Carnation\r\n(Bizarre Dianthus caryophyllus); Clover (Crimson Trifolium incarnatus);\r\nColumbine (Aquilegia vulgaris); Cowslip (Primula veris); Crowflower\r\n(Ragged Robin, Lychnis floscuculi); Cuckoo Buds (Butter cups, Ranunculus\r\nacris); Daisies (Bellis perennis); Eryngium M.

WASHBURN, Professor of Entomology, University of\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO PARTIES PLANNING TO PURCHASE NURSERY STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be quite out of place to offer any suggestions along this line to\r\nreaders of this magazine, and yet some buyers may find help in the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFor evident reasons it pays to buy Minnesota stock where possible, stock\r\nwhich has been tried out and found to be hardy, rather than purchase new\r\nvarieties, glowingly described in catalogues. Always buy from an\r\ninspected nursery.\r\n\r\nFor evident reasons it pays to buy from nurseries near at hand, so that\r\nthe time elapsing from the shipping of the trees or shrubs and the\r\nplanting is small.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is always desirable, if possible, to buy from the nurseryman\r\nhimself, a responsible party, rather than from an agent. It is further\r\nvery desirable to personally pick out your own stock in a visit to the\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nWhen the goods are received, see that they bear an inspection\r\ncertificate for the current year. The plants should be in good condition\r\nand show that the roots are protected from air and wrapped in moist\r\npacking material. The condition of the received goods indicates the\r\ncarefulness of the nurseryman or the contrary. Do not allow trees or\r\nshrubs to lie neglected after being received, where the roots will dry\r\nout. If you are not ready to plant they should be at once heeled in,\r\nfirst divesting them of their wrappings.\r\n\r\nIf any injurious insects, like scales or fungus-looking growths, are\r\nfound on the trees, the same should be reported to the Experiment\r\nStation. After planting the trees and shrubs, they should receive the\r\nbest of care in regard to cultivation.\r\n\r\nFinally, refuse to accept any raspberry or blackberry plants showing\r\ncrown gall on roots or crowns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWN GALL ON RASPBERRIES BLACKBERRIES.\r\n\r\nAll the nurserymen are able to recognize crown gall, and whatever we may\r\nthink regarding its effect or lack of effect upon apple, we know by\r\npersonal observation that it may and does cause the death of\r\nraspberries. This disease of course is, unfortunately, very\r\ncommon--almost universally present in our nurseries. The public,\r\ngenerally, are so well aware of its injurious effect upon canes that\r\nthey are indignant when any such stock is received from nurseries. It\r\nbehooves all nurserymen, therefore, for the sake of their own business\r\ninterests if nothing else, to be extremely careful that no diseased\r\nstock of any kind is sent to patrons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF A CARLOAD OF DISEASED POTATOES.\r\n\r\nThe State Entomologist, by virtue of being a collaborator with and agent\r\nfor the United States Horticultural Board, supervised the destruction by\r\nburning of 403 sacks of potatoes, seven per cent. of which, according to\r\nthe testimony of our Plant Pathology Division, were infested with\r\npowdery scab. The Great Northern Railroad, which had brought the\r\npotatoes from Canada, were given the choice by Federal authorities,\r\neither to return the potatoes to Canada or destroy them by burning,\r\nunder our supervision. They chose the latter procedure and the use of\r\nthe Minneapolis crematory was secured for this purpose. Ninety sacks of\r\nthis same shipment which were illegally unloaded at Casselton, N. Dak.,\r\nwere buried by North Dakota authorities. It is to be hoped that this\r\ndisease does not find its way into the potato belt in the Red River\r\nValley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON PLANT PESTS.\r\n\r\nPrepared by Section of Insect Pests, A. G. RUGGLES, and by\r\nSection of Plant Diseases, E. C. STAKMAN, University Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first real spraying of the apple orchard should be given just as the\r\ncenter bud of the flower cluster begins to show pink. The material to\r\nuse in the spraying compound is lime-sulphur (1 to 40) plus arsenate of\r\nlead, 1-1/2 pounds of the powder, or three pounds of the arsenate of\r\npaste to fifty gallons of the made-up lime-sulphur. If done properly\r\nthis will get the scab of the apple, blossom blight or the brown rot in\r\nthe plum, and is the most important spray for plum pocket. The arsenate\r\nof lead in the mixture will control the young of leaf eating insects and\r\nprecocious plum curculios.\r\n\r\nThe second most important spraying of the year is given within a week\r\nafter the blossoms fall, the same spraying compound being used. This\r\nspraying kills many of the germinating spores of such things as apple\r\nscab and also is the important spray for codling worm as well as for the\r\nplum curculio and for leaf eating insects.\r\n\r\nWatch carefully for the hatching of plant lice eggs. The ideal time to\r\nspray for these is just after hatching, and before the young lice become\r\nhidden in the bud scales or in the curl of the leaves. The spraying\r\nmaterial to use at this time is a sulphate of nicotine.\r\n\r\nPlow the plum orchard as soon as possible in order to turn under mummied\r\nplums, which are responsible for much of the primary infection of brown\r\nrot.\r\n\r\nPlowing the apple orchard early to turn under the old leaves is also\r\nessential in preventing scab spreading to the flower stalks.\r\n\r\nCultivate the vineyard in order to turn under the mummies. Practice\r\nclean cultivation from the very beginning in order to help control black\r\nrot and downy mildew. If the rot or mildew was very bad in the previous\r\nyears, early spraying with the Bordeaux mixture 4-4-50 is very\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nKeep the radishes, cauliflowers, and cabbages covered with a poison\r\nspray from April 30 to May 20 to prevent the ravages of the cabbage\r\nmaggot. This should be applied once a week in fair weather, and twice a\r\nweek in rainy weather. The spray is made as follows:\r\n\r\nLead arsenate, three-fourths ounce; New Orleans molasses, one-half pint;\r\nwater, one gallon.\r\n\r\nLook over the seedling cabbages carefully and destroy all which show any\r\nsign of wilting or rotting.\r\n\r\nCut out apple twigs badly injured by the buffalo tree hopper and burn\r\nthem immediately.\r\n\r\nWatch for plant lice on lettuce in cold frames. To combat the insects\r\nthe plants should be sprayed with nicofume liquid, one teaspoonful to a\r\ngallon of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMB HONEY, EXTRACTED HONEY, AND INCREASE.\r\n\r\nThe practical beekeeper must decide at the beginning of the honey season\r\nwhether he wishes to produce extracted honey, comb honey or merely to\r\nincrease the number of his colonies. The manner of management of his\r\napiary will depend upon such decision. At any rate a modern outfit, pure\r\nbred colonies in modern ten or eight frame hives, is required for\r\nsuccessful beekeeping no matter in what line of bee industry he may feel\r\ninclined to engage.\r\n\r\nFor production of extracted honey the ten frame hive is to be preferred.\r\nBees are less inclined to swarm in a ten frame hive, and two ten frame\r\nsupers as a rule will be required where three eight frame supers would\r\notherwise be necessary.\r\n\r\nIn successful extracted honey production swarming may be reduced to a\r\nminimum if during the dandelion and fruit trees honey flow, and in the\r\nbeginning of white clover flow, once a week an empty drawn comb be\r\ninserted into the middle of the brood nest. As soon as the brood chamber\r\nhas eight frames of brood the queen excluder is added and an extracting\r\nsuper added filled with white extracting combs. If the beekeeper does\r\nnot care to raise his extracted honey in snow white combs only, the\r\nexcluder may be omitted, but the result will be that the queen will lay\r\neggs throughout the whole hive, thus rendering extracting difficult on\r\naccount of brood present. When raising extracted honey on a large scale\r\ntwo extracting supers may suffice for each colony. When the one next to\r\nthe brood chamber is filled it is extracted at once, the top one taking\r\nits place next to the brood. The extracted super when empty is then\r\ngiven back to the bees and placed on top. When the second super is\r\nfilled the process is repeated. This process of extracting honey\r\nrequires a period of four or five weeks. All supers are removed at the\r\nend of the honey flow. The last full super, however, should not be\r\nextracted but saved for the feeding of light colonies in the fall and\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe easier way to produce extracted honey is to have enough supers, say\r\nthree or four for each colony. The first is added during the dandelion\r\nor fruit blossom flow as soon as the colony is strong enough to readily\r\nenter into it. When this super is nearly full and the combs can be seen\r\nthrough the top bars to whiten, another super is added next to the brood\r\nchamber, and the partly filled super is raised. When this second super\r\nbegins to get well filled, a third and a fourth super is added on top.\r\nIn the latitude of Minneapolis it is not advisable to insert a super\r\nnext to brood chambers after July 4th, or two weeks before the end of\r\nthe honey flow, because such procedure would result in a large amount of\r\nuncapped honey.\r\n\r\nComb honey should not be produced where the honey flow is slow and\r\nintermittent. Weak colonies will not produce comb honey profitably. In\r\nmaking up supers only A 1 sections should be used, with full sheets of\r\nextra thin foundation and three-eighths inch bottom starters of thin\r\nfoundation. Care should be taken to fasten the foundation very solidly,\r\nelse heat and weight of bees will cause it to drop. One or more bait\r\nsections should be used in the first comb honey super to induce the bees\r\nto enter into it more readily. Bait sections are the half finished,\r\nunmarketable sections of the previous season. One to four are used near\r\nthe center of each super.\r\n\r\n(To be continued in June No.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOME OF THE LADY SLIPPER--MOCCASIN FLOWER.\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA STATE FLOWER.]\r\n\r\n     While it is not the intention to publish anything in this\r\n     magazine that is misleading or unreliable, yet it must be\r\n     remembered that the articles published herein recite the\r\n     experience and opinions of their writers, and this fact must\r\n     always be noted in estimating their practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST\r\n\r\n\r\nVol. 44 JUNE, 1916 No. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State Flower and State Flag of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nE. A. SMITH, VICE PRES. JEWELL NURS. CO., LAKE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material in this paper has been gathered from several sources, part\r\nof which has never before been published. It is presented not so much in\r\nthe spirit of criticism as it is in the spirit of making the best of a\r\nmistake which the writer believes occurred when the moccasin flower was\r\ndesignated as the state flower of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nLast spring an acquaintance of mine was rambling through the woods and\r\ncame across the Cypripedium, or the Moccasin flower, or the Lady\r\nslipper, the state flower of Minnesota. He sent me a few specimens.\r\nAlthough I had lived in the state of Minnesota for a number of years,\r\nthis was the first time that I had ever seen the state flower or known\r\nanything about it. The incident set me to thinking, and I went to work\r\nto find out what I could about this flower. I herewith present that\r\ninformation as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are forty-one states in the Union that have a state flower. Other\r\nstates have the matter under consideration. This fact alone would\r\nindicate that a state flower is of some importance as an emblem, or it\r\nwould not be so generally considered by the various states. In most\r\ninstances the flower was selected by a vote of the public school\r\nscholars of the respective states. The vote was then submitted to the\r\nstate legislature and a resolution adopted making the state flower\r\nlegal. I submit to you the question: Are school children qualified to\r\nchoose a flower as an emblem of the state? Do they understand the\r\nconditions required in the state and the purpose of the selection\r\nsufficiently well to enable them to select intelligently? Do the\r\nchildren in your school know what flower is common in the northern part\r\nof the state as well as in the southern part of the state?\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, however, the state flower was not chosen by the school\r\nchildren of the state, but upon petition of the Woman's Auxiliary Board\r\nof World's Fair Managers a resolution was introduced into the senate\r\nFebruary 4th, 1893, by the late Senator W.B. Dean, providing that the\r\nwild Lady Slipper, or the Moccasin flower, Cypripedium calceolus, be\r\naccepted and the same designated and adopted as the state flower, or the\r\nfloral emblem of the state of Minnesota. This resolution was also\r\nadopted in the house the same day. A few years later upon petition of\r\nthe Nature Club of Minneapolis the variety was changed to the Reginae or\r\nSpectabile, variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lady Slipper--Minnesota State Flower. Somewhat under\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the selection in this state is, why was a flower chosen\r\nwhich is not common to any part of the state? We therefore have a state\r\nflower, beautiful in itself, but without special appeal to the people\r\nbecause it is comparatively unknown.\r\n\r\nThere are about forty species of the Cypripedium belonging to the north\r\ntemperate zone. Several of these species occur in the northern United\r\nStates and Canada, east of the Rocky Mountains, which are found in the\r\nstate of Minnesota. It is called the Moccasin flower because it\r\nresembles the Indian shoe. This plant grows preferably in cool and moist\r\nwoods or in bogs. It flowers principally during the months of May and\r\nJune. The varieties differ in color, being deep red, pink, yellow, white\r\nand variegated. All of the species, however, are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe varieties more commonly found in Minnesota are, Acaule, rose purple;\r\nCandidum, small white; Arietinum, red and white; Parviflorum, small\r\nyellow; Pubescens, large yellow; and Spectabile, description of which is\r\nas follows: Plants stout, leaves oval, acute; sepals, roundish, white;\r\npetals, oblong, white; labellum, white or pale pink purple. Very showy.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the Minnesota State Flower does not take kindly\r\nto civilization and cultivation, as it is very difficult to transplant.\r\nAbout ten years ago at Lake City, Minnesota, we tried to propagate the\r\nmoccasin flower. We dug the roots and transplanted them in ground\r\nespecially prepared in a nearby grove where we could watch their\r\ndevelopment, but the plants were a failure.\r\n\r\nA state flower should be one of the common flowers of the state, so\r\nfamiliar to all, that its name would suggest a picture of the flower\r\nitself. Probably not 10 per cent of the people of the state have ever\r\nseen it. On this account it is to be regretted that this variety was\r\nchosen as the flower emblem of the state. A state flower, like the state\r\nflag, should be accessible and familiar to everyone, and yet, probably,\r\nthe state flag of Minnesota is a stranger to many residents of the\r\nstate, for Minnesota did not have a state flag until 1893.\r\n\r\nAn emblem should mean something to the individual. The family coat of\r\narms and the iron cross are distinctive emblems. The shamrock in\r\nsentiment is as dear to an Irishman as his native land. If an emblem\r\nmeans something to the individual, how much more it ought to mean to the\r\nstate and nation.\r\n\r\nThe flag is an emblem of loyalty and patriotism. Men fight for it. They\r\nlay down their lives for it because it stands for home and country. I\r\nfancy if men did not know what the flag looked like, the fight would\r\nnot be a very fierce one. Do you know what the state flag of Minnesota\r\nlooks like? A description of it can be found in the Legislative Manual\r\nfor 1915. This flag bears a wreath of white moccasin flowers\r\n(Spectabile) upon a blue background, in the center of which is the state\r\nseal. The design was chosen by a committee of six ladies. It is\r\nappropriate and beautiful, and was designed by Mrs. Edward H. Center, of\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\nThe state should furnish an attractive picture of the state flower and\r\nthe state flag to every high school in the state, free of charge. The\r\ninfluence would be good, creating a deeper loyalty to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWisconsin State Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT ANNUAL MEETING BY SECY. F. CRANEFIELD, MADISON, WIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: We have with us today, Prof. Cranefield, secretary of\r\nthe Wisconsin Society. I am sure everybody will be pleased to hear from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Cranefield: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I thank you, Mr.\r\nPresident, for your very kind introduction. I know you meant well when\r\nyou introduced me as professor, but I really must plead \"not guilty\" to\r\nthe charge. There was a time, long ago, when I was connected with our\r\nAgricultural College, in a minor relation, that I was not in a position\r\nto resent it, but I have reformed since, and as secretary of the\r\nWisconsin Horticultural Society I am trying to live down the past.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that I am glad to be here. I want to come as long\r\nas you will let me come. We of the Wisconsin society are watching you\r\nclosely to see if we can by any means learn the secret of your success,\r\nand to that end we are here in considerable force. Our president is\r\nhere, and the managers of two of our largest co-operative fruit shippers\r\nassociations also.\r\n\r\nFrankly, we want to beat you if we can. You have the biggest and the\r\nbest society in the country, and we have the second biggest and next\r\nbest, and we are striving for first place.\r\n\r\nHaving now disposed of the usual compliments befitting the occasion I\r\nwill aim to tell you of a few things we are trying to do in the\r\nWisconsin society.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of our society during the past ten years have been directed\r\nquite largely to the development of commercial fruit-growing in the\r\nstate. While we have not overlooked nor forgotten the home owner we have\r\nbeen working to take commercial orcharding out of the hands of the\r\nfarmer and put it in the hands of specialists, and we are succeeding. We\r\nhave today about thirty thousand acres of purely commercial orchards in\r\nWisconsin and more coming. We discourage by every means at command the\r\nplanting of fruit trees by the man who is engaged in general farming\r\nexcept sufficient for his own use.\r\n\r\nFurther, in this campaign we aim to concentrate our efforts on certain\r\ndistricts so as to build up fruit centers. For instance we have in Door\r\nCounty, that narrow little neck of land between Green Bay and Lake\r\nMichigan, over seven thousand five hundred acres of orchards, apple and\r\ncherry.\r\n\r\nAlong the Bayfield shore line we have another splendid fruit district\r\nalmost, if not quite, as well known as Hood River and worth vastly more.\r\n\r\nIn the southwestern corner of the state along the valley of the Kickapoo\r\nRiver, on the high bluffs on either side of the river, have been planted\r\na thousand acres of apples and cherries in the past five years.\r\n\r\nWhile not all of this development is directly due to the Horticultural\r\nSociety, ours has been the moving spirit. The Kickapoo development is\r\ndue wholly to the work of the society.\r\n\r\nIn this way we are establishing an industry that will be a tremendous\r\nasset to the state. There was a time when dairying was but a feeble\r\nindustry in Wisconsin, and now we lead.\r\n\r\nOur society also aids in the development of marketing associations. In\r\ndoing these things we also aid the farmer and home owner, for whatever\r\nis best in the commercial orchard is best in the home orchard. Spraying,\r\npruning and cultivation as practiced by the expert serve as models for\r\nthe farmer who has but two dozen trees.\r\n\r\nThe other activities of our society are similar to yours. We publish a\r\nmagazine, as you do; we hold two conventions, as you do; in fact our\r\nwork, and no less our interests, are the same as yours, and I most\r\nsincerely hope that the very pleasant relations that have existed\r\nbetween the societies may continue for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing Fruit Direct.\r\n\r\nH. G. STREET, HEBRON, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn studying this subject, the direct marketing of fruit, let us first\r\nsee how much it includes. Does it include simply marketing alone? Or\r\ndoes the success of it depend principally upon the varieties of fruit\r\nset out together with the after cultivation, pruning and spraying? First\r\nof all you must interest people in your work by producing something that\r\nthey really want, and half of your problem will then be solved.\r\n\r\nThere are any number of places in the northwest where the demand far\r\nexceeds the supply. I do not mean for the common run of fruit full of\r\nworms and covered with scab, but, instead, strictly No. 1 fruit of the\r\nvery best varieties.\r\n\r\nAbout 1901, through the advice of my uncle, Dr. A. H. Street, of Albert\r\nLea, I joined your society, and through the experience of your members I\r\nlearned many valuable lessons. Perhaps the one that impressed me the\r\nmost was that of grafting our choicest varieties upon hardy crab stocks\r\nso as to make them hardy enough to withstand our hardest winters, and by\r\nso doing it nearly insures us against total failures in the fruit crop\r\nand especially against losing the trees outright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. H. G. Street, of Hebron, Ills.]\r\n\r\nThis top-working of course will not do all; we still have to assist\r\nNature by proper spraying, pruning, cultivating, etc. Doing all in your\r\npower to secure a crop each year to supply the trade you have already\r\nworked up is a big item in holding it.\r\n\r\nWhile studying your conditions, together with those of Wisconsin and\r\nIllinois, I became very much interested in the native plums as well as\r\nin the apple industry. Therefore I also set out some three acres of the\r\nfollowing varieties: Surprise, Terry, Wyant, Hammer and Hawkeye, also\r\nsome of the Emerald and Lombard.\r\n\r\nAs this was then new business to me, I had fallen into no deep ruts, and\r\nof course I took it for granted that all horticulturists practiced what\r\nthey preached. Therefore I pruned, sprayed, etc., according to\r\ndirections, and in due time the fruits of my labor commenced to show up,\r\nand they certainly were attractive to the eye as well as to the taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wolf River apple tree twelve years old, bearing eighteen\r\nbushels, in H. G. Street's orchard.]\r\n\r\nAs our supply increased our demand increased also, so that for the past\r\nfive years our average plum crop has been around 2,000 baskets (the\r\n8-lb. grape basket) and all sold readily at 25 to 35 cents retail.\r\n\r\nWe are located at Hebron, Illinois, eight miles south of Lake Geneva,\r\nWis., on the Chicago & Lake Geneva Railway, which makes an ideal\r\nlocation for a fancy trade. During plum harvest it is nothing uncommon\r\nto have fifty to 100 visitors a day. These customers include all\r\nclasses, from the Chicago millionaires to the common laborers, and all\r\nreceive the same cordial reception.\r\n\r\nWe make it a point never to allow them to think that we are close with\r\nour fruit--not even the neighborhood boys, as they are our best\r\nfriends. What they buy we charge them a good fair price for and never\r\nfail to give all new customers a few choice samples of best varieties.\r\n\r\nBy the latter part of the plum season our big red Wolf River apples\r\ncommence to show up and cook well; also Wealthy and McIntosh commence to\r\nget ripe enough to eat, and the demand each year has far exceeded the\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nSo far we have had very few poor apples, but we always sort them into\r\nthree grades, the third grade being made up into cider to sell while\r\nsweet. The second grade we sell as such for immediate use. The firsts of\r\nthe McIntosh we have sold at $2.00 to $2.50 per bushel, Wealthy,\r\nJonathan and Grimes at $1.50 to $2.00, while Wolf, N. W. Greening,\r\nSalome, Winesap, Milwaukee, etc., have averaged us $1.25 per bushel. We\r\nare always very careful not to have any bruised, diseased or ill shaped\r\nspecimens in our first grade.\r\n\r\nThe President: Can you tell us something more about your experience in\r\nmarketing direct? Do you sell all the fruit you raise on the place?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: We sell about all the fruit that we raise direct to the\r\nconsumer. When we first started we started with strawberries, and about\r\nhalf of our crop went to the merchants, and he would retail it for 20\r\nper cent, but to any one that came there for it we would charge the full\r\nretail price, same as he had to charge, and we never had any trouble\r\nwith any of the stores that we dealt with. If we have any seconds or\r\nanything we don't like to put out to the stores we sell them to our\r\ncustomers and charge them whatever we think would be right for them.\r\n\r\nAs to plums, about two-thirds of those would sell right direct to\r\ncustomers coming there, the rest we supplied to the stores at 20 per\r\ncent discount so that they could retail them at the same price that we\r\nretail them for. Since the apples have begun to bear it seems that\r\ntwo-thirds of the people want the McIntosh, and almost everyone is\r\nsatisfied with its flavor. They average a little larger with us than the\r\nWealthy, and some of them you can hardly tell from the Wealthy unless\r\nyou know just about what the fruit is. Last year we kept them until\r\nabout February or possibly later, but an apple with as good a flavor as\r\nthat you cannot keep from being eaten up.\r\n\r\nThe President: I suppose that is automobile trade?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: A great deal of it is.\r\n\r\nThe President: How did you get it? By advertising?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: No, by doing something so much different from what anybody\r\nelse is doing you get people to talking. I think the Wolf River apple\r\ntogether with the Terry and Surprise plums have been the cause of\r\ngetting started. Of course, the McIntosh now is helping out, too. You\r\ngive a person a few Wolf River, not for eating but for cooking, and then\r\ngive him a Wealthy or something like that to eat--they will be looking\r\nat the big Wolf River and eating the other and seem to be well satisfied\r\nand always come back. Whenever we sell to the stores we always gauge our\r\nprices so that the majority of their customers will take our fruit\r\nbefore taking the shipped in fruit from Chicago. We find with grapes we\r\ncan charge about five cents a basket more than they retail the Michigan\r\ngrapes for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View in eleven year old orchard of H. G. Street.]\r\n\r\nFor native plums we get more than they do for the Michigan fruit. We\r\nhave had quite a good many of the Burbank plums, but we cannot sell over\r\none-third as many as we do of the natives.\r\n\r\nA Member: You don't ship them, so don't consider the packing?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: The only ones we ship are those ordered by people coming\r\nthere or by letter. If they want a bushel we pack them in a bushel box.\r\nIf they want three or six bushels then we pack them in barrels.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: Where are you located?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: Just south of the Wisconsin state line.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson: I am located 100 miles west of here, and I shipped out 400\r\nbushels of apples to the Dakotas last year direct.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: How many growers are there in your neighborhood growing\r\nfruit commercially?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: I do not know of any who spray, cultivate and prune\r\naccording to the best methods within about 100 miles. We always make it\r\na point to give our customers good fruit, so that we are not afraid to\r\nrecommend it. Then there is another advantage. If they come right there,\r\nand we have any seconds we can tell them just what they are, and if they\r\nwant them we can sell them for what they are worth, but if we are\r\nputting them into a store, I prefer not to put in seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. Kochendorfer: I think that is the advantage of disposing on a public\r\nmarket. You have a chance to sell the inferior goods without any coming\r\nback.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: The main thing is to use improved methods and try to outdo\r\nthe other fellow. Cultivate a little more thoroughly, put in your cover\r\ncrop, not over-fertilize but all you possibly can; give the dormant\r\nspray; spray before bloom very thoroughly and again after bloom; two\r\nweeks after that again, about July 15th.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: How many apple trees have you?\r\n\r\nMr. Street: We now have ten acres in apples, but most of them are young,\r\nabout three acres in bearing.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I would like to ask the gentleman if in a small place\r\nthat way he hasn't a better local market than we have here in the larger\r\ncities. Around Lake Minnetonka they raise grapes, but we get most of our\r\ngrapes from Ohio and Indiana. I have wondered why it is that these\r\ngrapes go to another market when they can just as well go to the\r\nMinneapolis market. You know as well as I do anyone buying fruit in the\r\nTwin Cities always buy fruit grown in Ohio or Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. Street: I do not know why it is, but so far we haven't realized that\r\nwe have any competition. We charge for our best eating apples fully as\r\nmuch as the stores have to charge for the Western fancy packed fruit.\r\nThere is not a worm hole or speck of disease on the No. 1, and really I\r\ncan't see how they can compete after raising the fruit in the West and\r\npacking and shipping it to Chicago and then out there. The price they\r\nwould have to charge there would make us a good fair price; in fact, a\r\ngood big price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Satisfactory Marketing System.\r\n\r\nG. A. ANDERSON, RENVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have marketed this fall some over 400 barrels of apples, mostly\r\nWealthy, Duchess and Northwestern Greening. Three hundred barrels of\r\nthese were shipped direct to local merchants in Dakota and western\r\nMinnesota towns in small shipments of a few barrels at a time or as fast\r\nas they could sell them. I started this way of marketing during the big\r\ncrop of 1913 and this year again, getting nearly all of my old customers\r\nback and many new ones. I secured satisfactory prices, and for my\r\nlocation I believe I have solved the marketing problem. One does not pay\r\nmuch attention to the marketing as long as enough only for local demand\r\nis produced, but when one has a surplus to dispose of the marketing\r\nproblem looms rather large. I have tried several times shipping to\r\ncommission firms, but have never received satisfactory returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Successful Cold Storage for Apples.\r\n\r\nH. F. HANSEN, ORCHARDIST, ALBERT LEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence Wedge: I want to preface this short paper with the\r\nstatement that Mr. Hansen is a man who has worked himself up from the\r\nvery bottom of the horticultural ladder. He came to Albert Lea a very\r\npoor man, and I think supported himself for some time by trapping and\r\nfishing and such work as he was able to do. He is a man with a great\r\ntendency to investigate and to work out problems for himself. By his\r\nthrift and persevering investigations he has brought himself into a fine\r\nproperty and great success. He is the market gardener in our part of the\r\ncountry and a credit to his kind. (Mr. Wedge reads the paper.)\r\n\r\nWhen my orchard, near the city of Albert Lea, began to bear heavy crops\r\nof fruit, I found it very desirable to hold the Wealthy and other kinds\r\nthat ripen at the same time until after the farmers had marketed their\r\nfruit. We have a very good cold storage in Albert Lea that is open to\r\nthe public, but the price they charge is sixty cents per barrel for two\r\nmonths' storage, which is more than the fruit will bear, and so I began\r\nto think of putting up a cold storage of my own.\r\n\r\nMy first one was built underground with pipes for ice and salt to cool\r\nit, something like the system that I am now using. But I found out in\r\nthe first season that it takes a great deal of ice to offset the heat\r\nthat is coming in from the ground at the sides and bottom of the cellar.\r\nAnd so I built the storage which I am now using entirely above ground,\r\nusing the basement under it for storing cabbage and vegetables. I built\r\nthis in 1913, the size 28x56 feet, using cement blocks for the basement,\r\nwhere the cabbages are stored. The cold storage above this is built as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFirst, an ordinary frame building with 2x4 inch studdings sheathed on\r\nthe outside with drop siding with No. 3 flooring. Inside of this\r\nsheathing 2x4 inch studs placed flatwise, sheathed on the inside with\r\nNo. 3 flooring, and the six-inch space back of the studs filled with\r\nsawdust. On the outside of this firing strips one-half foot are nailed,\r\nwhich are covered with linofelt. One-half foot firing strips are nailed\r\ninside of this, and these also covered with linofelt. To this again\r\none-half foot firing strips are added, to which are nailed metal lath,\r\nand the whole is plastered with cement. The floor both above and below\r\nis made of 2×12 joists, with No. 3 flooring nailed below the joints, the\r\nspace between which is then filled with ten inches of saw dust, leaving\r\nan air space of two inches at the upper edge of the joists. The joists\r\nare then covered with linofelt and then the linofelt covered with No. 3\r\nflooring.\r\n\r\nOn the north and west sides I found it necessary to add one more\r\nwaterproof coat of linofelt in order to make sure of keeping out the\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nI have so far only finished up for cold storage one-half of the room,\r\nusing the other half for a packing room, so that my present facilities\r\nare only 28×28 feet. This room is cooled by eight inch pipes of\r\ngalvanized iron, extending from the attic above to troughs near the\r\nfloor, that are sloping so as to carry off the melted ice. These pipes\r\nare on both sides about two feet apart. The ice is pulled up into the\r\nattic by horsepower and broken up small enough into pieces to feed the\r\npipes. The amount of salt used with the ice depends upon how fast we\r\nwant the ice to melt. A large quantity of salt cools the storage down\r\nquicker. In practice I find that it takes one hour for a man to elevate\r\na ton of ice, chop it up and fill the pipes. They hold something over a\r\nton and must be filled every other day in ordinary September weather. It\r\nwill not do to let the pipes remain less than one-half full. When the\r\nice gets down that far, we have to fill again.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of my storage when it is entirely furnished up and the\r\npresent capacity doubled will be about $3,000.00. At present it holds\r\n2,000 standard size apple boxes.\r\n\r\nI find that it only pays to put in good fruit that in ordinary seasons\r\nwill keep until the first of March and hold its flavor well and give\r\ngood satisfaction on the market. Icing stops about the middle of\r\nNovember. The cost per box for storage is as follows: Ice and salt, ten\r\ncents. Interest on investment, six cents. I have figured out carefully\r\nthe entire cost of growing and storing apples, and find out that leaving\r\nout the interest on the value of the land, it will approximate\r\nforty-eight cents per bushel. This includes cultivation, spraying,\r\npacking, and picking. The question which now interests me is whether we\r\ncan grow fruit good enough and stand the expense and compete with apples\r\ngrown in the other good fruit sections of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: I had the pleasure of visiting this plant with Mr. Wedge, and\r\nthis man had quite a good many boxes of as fine apples as you would wish\r\nto see. This was along the latter part of February, and they were in\r\nfine condition. He had a lot of Jonathans and Yankees and some other\r\nvarieties I don't remember, grown on top-worked trees there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plum Curculio.\r\n\r\nEDWARD A. NELSON, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n(Prize Winner at Gideon Memorial Contest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe small crescent-shaped punctures, so common on apples, plums, peaches\r\nand other fruits, are made by a small snout-beetle known as the plum\r\ncurculio. The beetles issue from their winter quarters at about the time\r\nthe trees are in full bloom and feed on the tender foliage, buds and\r\nblossoms. Later they attack the newly set fruit, cutting small circular\r\nholes through the skin in feeding, while the females, in the operation\r\nof egg-laying, make the crescentic cuts so characteristic of this\r\nspecies. The egg, deposited under the skin of the fruit, soon hatches\r\ninto a very small whitish larva or grub, which makes its way into the\r\nflesh of the fruit. Here it feeds greedily and grows rapidly, becoming,\r\nin the course of two weeks, the fat, dirty white \"worm\" so well known\r\namong fruit growers.\r\n\r\nThe curculio is a native of North America and for more than 150 years\r\nhas been known as an enemy of fruits. Our early horticultural literature\r\nabounds with reference to its depredations. In more recent times the\r\ngreat increase in planting of fruits, brought about to supply the\r\nincreased demand, has permitted it to become much more abundant than\r\nformerly, and the plum curculio constitutes at the present time one of\r\nthe most serious insect enemies of orchard fruits. Statistics gathered\r\nof its depredations show that it is distributed over much of the area of\r\nthe United States. Its western limit is, roughly, a line drawn through\r\nthe centers of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma\r\nand Texas. East of this line the entire United States is infested except\r\nthe southern third of Florida and the northern half of Maine.\r\n\r\nIs the plum curculio causing much damage to the fruit growing industry\r\nof this country? That it is is shown by the National Conservation\r\nCommittee in its report in Volume III, page 309, where it states that\r\nthe average annual loss in late years to only three fruits is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nApples           $3,257,806\r\n\r\nPeaches           4,088,814\r\n\r\nPlums             1,244,149\r\n                 ----------\r\nGrand Total      $8,590,769\r\n\r\nJust think of it! A total loss each year to only three fruits of over\r\n$8,500,000. This amount is a heavy drain upon the fruit growing\r\nindustry of this country. During the past twenty-five or thirty years\r\nthe total damage caused by this insect, to the various fruits which it\r\nattacks, would, on a conservative estimate, probably be not less than\r\n$100,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese figures show the absolute need of the adoption of effective\r\nremedial measures against this insect so as to lessen this loss. But\r\nbefore we can hope to combat this insect systematically and successfully\r\nit is necessary to know its life history and habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The curculio in its stages of growth, and its fruit\r\ninjury.]\r\n\r\nThere are four distinct stages in its life cycle: (1) The egg, (2) the\r\nlarva, or \"worm,\" (3) the pupa, and (4) the adult, or beetle.\r\n\r\nThe curculio passes the winter in the adult stage under accumulations\r\nof partly decayed leaves, among the closely-packed dried grass of\r\nsod-covered orchards, and probably wherever suitable protection from the\r\nwinter may be found. Its depredations are usually worse near woods, so\r\nit probably finds here very suitable places for wintering.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when the fruit buds are unfolding, the beetles begin to\r\nemerge from their winter quarters and feed to some extent on the\r\nblossoms and tender leaves of the fruit trees. Mating soon begins, and\r\nby the time the fruit is well set the beetles make this fruit the chief\r\nobject of their attention. The circular punctures in the skin are\r\nfeeding punctures, while the crescent-shaped ones are egg-laying\r\npunctures. A single egg is deposited in a puncture, although several may\r\nbe placed in a single fruit. From one to eight eggs may be deposited\r\ndaily by an individual female, which may be continued for several\r\nmonths. The great majority of the eggs, however, are deposited by the\r\nend of eight weeks. These eggs hatch in from three to seven days, being\r\ninfluenced greatly by the weather.\r\n\r\nThe egg hatches into a larva, or \"worm,\" which bores into the fruit. It\r\nbecomes full-grown in from twelve to twenty days and bores out of the\r\nfruit. It enters the soil, burrows to a depth of one-half to two inches,\r\nand forms an earthern cell in which to pupate. In three or four weeks it\r\nemerges as a full grown beetle and attacks the ungathered fruit and the\r\nfoliage. On the approach of cold weather the beetle seeks a protected\r\nplace in which to pass the winter.\r\n\r\nThe character of the injury is very nearly alike in all fruits. In the\r\nplum the fruit often falls to the ground before mature. In seasons of\r\nshort crops very little fruit may remain to ripen. The punctures cause\r\nthe fruit to become mis-shaped and to exude masses of gum. The ripe\r\nfruit becomes \"wormy.\" The late varieties may be seriously injured by\r\nthe new generation of adults. In the apple the injury to the fruit is\r\nabout the same as in the plum, except that the infested fruit is not so\r\nlikely to fall to the ground and that the egg rarely hatches into the\r\ngrub there. The fruit becomes knotted and pitted. The late varieties may\r\nalso be injured by the new generation of adults. In the peach, cherry\r\nand other stone fruits, the injury closely resembles that of the plum.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plum curculio has some natural enemies that tend to reduce\r\nits numbers somewhat, yet they are not important enough to be considered\r\nas effective means of control. Some of these natural enemies are\r\nparasites of various kinds, birds, chickens and the like.\r\n\r\nThere are several remedial measures practiced, varying in their degree\r\nof effectiveness. Away back in the early days of horticulture in this\r\ncountry, when the curculio became very abundant rewards were offered for\r\nan effective method of combating it. Several were proposed, but only a\r\nfew were at all effective. The best of these methods is what is called\r\n\"jarring.\"\r\n\r\nThe curculio has the habit of falling to the ground and \"playing\r\n'possum\" when disturbed. This led to the practice of holding or\r\nspreading sheets beneath the tree and then striking the tree a sudden,\r\nforcible blow with a padded pole or mallet in order to dislodge the\r\nbeetles. The trees were jarred daily from the time the calyx or \"shuck\"\r\nbegan to slip from the newly set fruit until the beetles had\r\ndisappeared, or for at least four or five weeks. This was practiced to\r\nquite an extent, but it takes too much time and is too expensive.\r\n\r\nA still better remedy is clean cultivation. Experiments have shown that\r\nas high as 76.75 per cent. of the pupae may be destroyed by means of\r\nthorough cultivation. The mere breaking of the pupal cell, leaving the\r\nearth in contact with the body of the pupa, is fatal to many. Others are\r\nkilled by the crushing action of the earth as it is stirred. Others are\r\nexposed to the elements and subject to the attacks of their enemies,\r\nsuch as ants and birds. Sunlight is quickly fatal to them, and exposure\r\nto the air on a warm day in the shade is also fatal to them.\r\nObservations show that the insect is in the pupal condition in the\r\nground in from fifty to sixty-five days after the falling of the\r\nblossoms of such fruit as apples and plums. Data have been presented to\r\nshow that the minimum time spent in the ground is about twenty days.\r\nShallow cultivation should begin, therefore, in about eight or nine\r\nweeks after blossoming. It is best to cultivate every week or oftener\r\nfor six or seven weeks. It is very necessary that this cultivation\r\nshould reach immediately beneath the spread of the limbs, as most of the\r\ncurculios are found here, having dropped from the fruit above and\r\nburrowed into the soil where they fell.\r\n\r\nThe third method of combating the curculio, the method most commonly\r\nused and most generally recommended, is spraying with arsenical poisons.\r\nThe spray most generally used is arsenate of lead. The most economical\r\nand effective way is to add arsenate of lead to Bordeaux mixture. The\r\nBordeaux is mixed in the following proportions: three pounds of copper\r\nsulphate (blue vitriol), four pounds of lime, and fifty gallons of\r\nwater. To this amount of Bordeaux mixture three pounds of arsenate of\r\nlead are added. In place of Bordeaux mixture lime-sulphur may be used.\r\nIf the insecticide is used alone, three pounds of arsenate of lead in\r\nfifty gallons of water make an effective spray. It is best to spray\r\nthree times, the first spraying coming just before the blossoms open,\r\nthe second coming ten days later, and the third another ten days later.\r\nThe cost is from ten to fifteen cents per tree for the three sprayings.\r\nThis cost is lessened when combined with other sprays.\r\n\r\nWhile spraying greatly reduces the injuries inflicted, yet it is\r\napparent that account must be taken of other factors, such as the\r\nrelative abundance of insects as compared with the amount of fruit\r\npresent on the trees. With a small fruit crop and an abundance of\r\ncurculios, the most thorough spraying in the world will not serve to\r\nbring through a satisfactory amount of sound fruit.\r\n\r\nWhile spraying is undoubtedly the most important aid and, if persisted\r\nin from year to year, may answer for its control, as its effects are\r\ncumulative, yet it is clear that other control measures should also be\r\nemployed. In all cases which have come under observation the insects\r\nhave always been found most abundant in orchards which are in sod or are\r\npoorly cared for and allowed to grow up more or less in weeds and trash.\r\nAlso, orchards near woods always suffer severely, especially along the\r\nborder. As opposed to this condition is the notably less injury in\r\norchards kept free from weeds and trash. In such cases spraying usually\r\ngiven for other insects, as the codling moth, serves to keep the\r\ncurculio well under control. In fact, it may be said as a general\r\nstatement that the curculio will never become seriously troublesome in\r\norchards given the usual routine attention in cultivation, spraying and\r\npruning now considered essential in successful fruit growing. Serious\r\nlosses from the curculio are almost conclusive evidence of neglect,\r\nwhich is best and most quickly corrected by the adoption of proper\r\norchard practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN ANTIDOTE FOR WASP STINGS.--It not infrequently happens that\r\npersons biting unguardedly into fruit in which a wasp is concealed\r\nreceive stings in the mouth or throat. Such stings may be exceedingly\r\ndangerous and even fatal since the affected tissues swell rapidly and\r\nthis is liable to cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing. An\r\neffective antidote is employed in Switzerland. The sting is rubbed\r\nvigorously with garlic, or, if it is too deep in the throat for this\r\ntreatment, a few drops of the juice from bruised garlic are swallowed.\r\nIf garlic is not to be obtained onion may take its place, but is a less\r\nactive agent. The efficacy of this simple remedy was verified by a Swiss\r\nspecialist, who found it important enough to be presented at a session\r\nof the Vaudois Society of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasing the Fertility of the Land.\r\n\r\nPROF. F. J. ALWAY, DIVISION OF SOILS, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been asked to speak on \"Increasing the Fertility of the Land.\" To\r\nspeak on such a subject is sometimes a rather delicate matter because\r\nsome people consider they have a soil so good that you can't increase\r\nits fertility. With some of the prairie soils, when they were first\r\nplowed up that wouldn't have been so very far amiss. Take those black\r\nprairie soils with the grayish yellow clay subsoil, with an abundance of\r\nlime in it, which you find in a large part of the state, including a\r\nlarge part of Hennepin County, and you have as good a soil as you may\r\nexpect to find anywhere on the earth's surface. But you can't keep a\r\nsoil up to its full limit of fertility, no matter how good it is, unless\r\nyou frequently treat it with something.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. F. J. Alway.]\r\n\r\nWhen a soil is well supplied with lime there are three things that are\r\nliable to be deficient. If it is not well supplied with lime there may\r\nbe four, but the bulk of your soils are good enough so far as lime is\r\nconcerned. Those three are potash, which is abundant and will be\r\nabundant 100 years from now, phosphoric acid, or phosphorus, with which\r\nour soils are fairly well supplied, and nitrogen, which comes from the\r\nvegetable matter. In nitrogen our prairie soils are remarkably rich when\r\nfirst plowed up. The phosphoric acid and the potash you can not lose\r\nunless they are taken away in the form of crops, but the nitrogen may be\r\nlost without even taking off crops. All you have to do is to cultivate\r\nyour soil, when part of the nitrogen becomes soluble in water and is\r\ncarried down by the rain into the water-table unless you have plants\r\ngrowing with roots to take it up; a large part escapes into the air. So\r\nwhen your black prairie soil has been under cultivation for twenty\r\nyears, as an orchard, usually from one-half to one-third of the\r\noriginal nitrogen has escaped, most of it into the air, only the smaller\r\npart being carried off in the crops. That is the one thing that\r\norchardists and horticulturists have to concern themselves about first\r\nof all, so far as soil fertility is concerned.\r\n\r\nI see that the first of the questions for me to answer deals with that.\r\n\"What crop do you consider the best green manure?\" There are two kinds\r\nof green manures. One is represented by rye. Rye takes up the nitrogen\r\nthat is in the soil, and when it dies leaves behind what it took out of\r\nthe soil; the next crop can get this. By plowing under the rye crop you\r\ndo not increase the amount of nitrogen, the most important element of\r\nfertility in the soil.\r\n\r\nWe have a better green manure than that, better than rye or oats or\r\nbarley or any of those plants that properly belong to the grass family;\r\nnamely, the members of the clover, bean or pea family--all of these\r\nplants which are called legumes, which have pods and which have flowers\r\nshaped like butterflies.\r\n\r\nAs these grow they take up nitrogen from the air; the bacteria which\r\nmake their home on the roots of those plants take the nitrogen from the\r\nair and give it to their host plants. The plants receive this nitrogen,\r\nstore it in themselves, and when the crop is plowed under you have a\r\ngreat amount of nitrogen added to the soil. Now, a clover crop of an\r\nacre growing from spring until the freeze-up in the fall may take out of\r\nthe air as much as 120 pounds of nitrogen. One hundred and twenty pounds\r\nof nitrogen, bought in the form of commercial fertilizer from Swift &\r\nCompany, or Northrup, King & Company, would cost you $24.00. The clover\r\nhas taken that much out of the air. If the crop were pastured off, the\r\ngreater part of this nitrogen would be returned to the soil; when you\r\nplow the clover under still more nitrogen is taken from the air by\r\nbacteria that live upon the decaying plant material, and you may have\r\n$48.00 worth of nitrogen per acre added to the soil by simply growing\r\nclover for one year.\r\n\r\nAny kind of green manure crop that bears pods is good. Vetches are good,\r\nand soy beans are among the best for orchards. Clover, if you give it\r\ntime to make a good growth, is as good as anything.\r\n\r\nThe next question is--\"Should apple raisers use commercial fertilizers?\"\r\nNow, the apple tree, when it is growing on good soil, makes such a\r\nvigorous root development that it is hard to get any commercial\r\nfertilizer to help it. On poor soils it, like any other kind of plant,\r\nwill respond to fertilizers. Some of the eastern experimental stations\r\nhave been carrying on investigations with commercial fertilizers for a\r\ngreat many years to see whether in apple orchards these will cause an\r\nincrease in the yield or an improvement in the quality of the fruit. On\r\ngood soils, even after ten or twelve years' fertilization they have been\r\nfound to have no effect except in the case of nitrogen, and this can be\r\nbetter supplied in the form of a green manure plowed under than in any\r\nother way. That is to say, keep your orchard clean until the last of\r\nJuly or first of August, sow your green manure crop, let it grow until\r\nfreeze-up and stay there during the winter time. It holds the snow and\r\nso affords some winter protection. In the spring plow it under, and you\r\nplow under all the nitrogen that the plants had collected the previous\r\nyear. Then keep your orchard clean during the summer time, until in July\r\nor August you again sow the green manure crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Applying ground limestone to an acid soil to determine\r\nwhether liming will be profitable. Half of the field is left unlimed.]\r\n\r\nThe fertilizers that I get more inquiries about than any others are the\r\nphosphates--bone meal, acid phosphate and rock phosphate.\r\nHorticulturists have read that striking results are being obtained with\r\nthese on certain crops in the eastern and central states, and they want\r\nto know whether the same fertilizers will pay here. Some inquire about\r\npotash fertilizers. With the latter there is no doubt but that the\r\nresults we would obtain would, even under ordinary circumstances, not\r\npay. At the present time potash costs about ten times what it does in\r\ntimes of peace. Sulphate of potash, which ordinarily brings $45.00 per\r\nton, is now quoted at $450. This puts its use out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe phosphoric acid fertilizers are no higher now than usual. They cost,\r\naccording to the kind, from $9.50 to $25.00 per ton. Some of them are\r\nproduced near here--in South St. Paul. With tree crops, apple, plum and\r\npear, we need expect no increased yield from the use of phosphates,\r\nunless it be on our very poorest soils. On certain crops, like the bush\r\nfruits--the currants and the raspberries, we might get a distinct\r\nbenefit. I cannot give a definite answer to that. I can tell you what\r\nresults they have obtained in New York state, what they have obtained in\r\nPennsylvania or Illinois or Maine, but what results we would get in\r\nMinnesota we do not know. We can't apply their results to our\r\nconditions. The only thing we can do is to carry on such experiments\r\nhere, and they have not yet been started. That brings me to a third\r\nquestion I have here.\r\n\r\n\"What experiments are being conducted by the University of Minnesota\r\nwith orchard and other horticultural crops?\" We realized the importance\r\nof this matter and plans were prepared. Then, as you know the last\r\nlegislature was economical. It decided that one of the best places to\r\nmake a cut would be in the funds for experimental work; when these funds\r\nwere reduced we not only could start no new experiments but even had to\r\ncut off some of the old ones. For that reason these fertilizer\r\nexperiments have to wait until the next legislature or the one after. I\r\nhope the next legislature will make such an appropriation that they may\r\nbe begun.\r\n\r\nNow, for the next question. A man states that he can secure at a very\r\nlow rate limestone from one of the Minneapolis companies producing\r\ncrushed limestone for road-making purposes and wants to know whether it\r\nwill pay him to haul it to his farm. Well, if you do not have any other\r\nwork for your teams it may pay you. However, if your time is valuable,\r\nyou had better take some samples of the soil and send them in to the\r\nexperiment station. Just address them to the Soils Department or Soils\r\nDivision. Then we can decide whether it is worth while trying some of\r\nthe limestone. We cannot tell you whether it will pay; we can tell you\r\nwhether it is likely to pay, or whether it is likely to be a waste of\r\nenergy, or whether it is so doubtful that you ought to give it a fair\r\ntrial. On perhaps two-thirds of the fields in Hennepin County it would\r\nbe a waste of money and energy; on about half of the others, we may say,\r\nit is almost certain to be a good investment at a dollar a ton. On the\r\nremaining portion we simply can't say. On these, chances are even\r\nwhether it would pay. No crops are injured by limestone, so you are safe\r\nin putting it on. Practically all crops are benefited by it on sour\r\nsoils and especially the vegetable crops.\r\n\r\nThe next question is--\"Are the black peat or muck soils first class? Do\r\nthey need anything besides drainage?\" Some of them, a very few, produce\r\nreally good crops when they are drained, plowed and brought under\r\nordinary cultivation without fertilization, but only a few. Nearly all\r\nof them need commercial fertilizer, and until a bog covered with peat\r\nsoil has been carefully examined to ascertain the depth of the peat, the\r\ndifficulty of drainage, and the character of the peat (because peats\r\ndiffer greatly within a few miles of each other) it is unwise to attempt\r\nto reclaim it. Within three miles of the experiment station we have\r\nthree bogs very different in character. One, about half a mile from the\r\nbuildings, is heavily charged with lime. Another has an exceedingly\r\nsmall quantity of lime so that profitable crop production of any kind\r\nwould be out of the question without a heavy application of ground\r\nlimestone or quicklime. Still another one stands between these two. One\r\nof them can be reclaimed without any great expense, but with the one it\r\nwould be a very expensive matter to fertilize and treat with lime after\r\nit had been drained.\r\n\r\nThose are the questions that have been given me. Are there any other\r\nquestions?\r\n\r\nMr. McCall: What is peat lacking in?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Practically all peats are lacking in potash. If the peat\r\nlayer be very shallow, six inches, twelve inches, sometimes even\r\ntwenty-four inches, the plants are able to get their roots down through\r\nthe peat and get their potash from the underlying clay or loam. In that\r\ncase no fertilizer is needed. Some of the peats lack lime, some of them\r\nlack lime, potash and phosphoric acid, and some these three and nitrogen\r\nalso, so that you either have to apply some commercial form of nitrogen\r\nor grow legumes as green manures.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What was the trouble where I couldn't raise strawberries on\r\nnew wood soil?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: I couldn't answer that.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: The leaf mold was six or eight inches deep.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Was it any deeper than that?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I don't know, it may have been down a foot, and the leaf\r\nmold had been accumulating there for ages.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: In some cases the peat is so thoroughly decayed that it looks\r\nlike leaf mold and it may be a foot or two feet deep.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: This was no peat, it was just wood soil. I could not raise\r\nanything--\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Did the plants grow?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Yes, the plants grew and wintered well but didn't bear\r\nworth a cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Did they make lots of runners?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Oh, fairly good, but right over the fence in the next field\r\nthat had been worked for twenty-five years I got 260 bushels of\r\nstrawberries to the acre; never had any manure on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: The more leaf mold the more nitrogen; if you have too much\r\nnitrogen it may develop the vine and fail to form fruit or seed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: On heavy black prairie soil, three feet deep, where I am\r\ngrowing eighty bushels of corn to the acre, I want to put in\r\nstrawberries, and I have a lot of wood ashes, dry wood ashes, not\r\nleached ashes, but dry wood ashes. Would it be worth while to put that\r\non or would that overdo the thing? Would it be policy to put that on?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: It is not likely to do any harm, and it is likely to do some\r\ngood. Wood ashes contain chiefly lime and potash. The potash will be a\r\ndistinct benefit. The lime isn't of any particular benefit to this crop\r\non most soils. For strawberries it is slightly harmful on our ordinary\r\nsoils that are originally well supplied with lime.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: On another piece a ways from that I put out a young orchard,\r\nand in order to start the trees well I had covered the ground half an\r\ninch deep with wood ashes around those trees. I noticed that the weeds\r\ngrew there twice as quick as they did when I got away from the wood\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: There you have the benefit of the potash and the lime. If you\r\nput lime in the orchards it will make the clover and most of the other\r\ngreen manure crops grow better, and thus you gain in nitrogen from the\r\nlime; you gain in potash as it comes from the wood ashes.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Have you ever found any ground with too much leaf mold on\r\nit to grow good strawberries?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: I remember when I broke out my place where I am living now\r\nI had a place where the leaves had collected and rotted until I would\r\nsay there was eight or ten inches of leaf mold. When you went across it\r\nyou would sink in almost to your shoe tops. On that piece of ground I\r\ngrew 11,000 quarts of strawberries to the acre in a year, the largest\r\nyield I had ever grown on that leaf mold. You can never get too much\r\nleaf mold. There must have been something else besides the leaf mold.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: In case a crop does not give a satisfactory yield it may be\r\ndue to other things than the soil, and until we eliminate the other\r\npossible causes we can't safely blame it to the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: What do those black soils in the western part of the state\r\nneed? They have a whitish deposit on top.\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Drainage. That is alkali.\r\n\r\nMr. Kochendorfer: I have a ten-year apple orchard that I disked last\r\nyear and kept it tolerably clean this spring. There were a lot of\r\ndandelions sprung up that I mowed down the middle of July, and since\r\nthen they have grown up again. Will they take nitrogen the same as\r\nclover?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: They won't take any from the air. They will act like so much\r\nrye, but when they die and decay nitrogen will be gathered from the air\r\nand added to the soil by bacteria that live upon the decaying vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Did you ever hear of them dying?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Dandelions? If they are plowed under.\r\n\r\nA Member: Is it practicable to grow soy beans in this soil? Can they be\r\ngotten at a reasonable price, and can we mature them here?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: They mature here without any serious difficulty. There are a\r\ngreat many different varieties. If you order them from a distant seed\r\nhouse you may get a variety that will mature in Louisiana but not in\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nA Member: How about cowpeas?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Cowpeas are disappointing thus far north. In Minnesota they\r\nare not nearly as satisfactory as the soy bean. In an unusually warm\r\nsummer they are satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA Member: With the soy bean do you have to plow in the whole of it?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Yes. The whole plant ought to be plowed under.\r\n\r\nA Member: Would it be practicable to feed soy beans in an orchard?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Yes. You don't get quite the same benefit from the green\r\nmanure when you pasture as when you plow under.\r\n\r\nA Member: How about the hairy vetch? Does it grow here?\r\n\r\nMr. Alway: Yes. It grows here. It is not a bad crop at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOISONING TREE SCALE.--We take the following from _Scientific\r\nAmerican_ as worth consideration by the owners of orchards and lawns:\r\n\r\nA correspondent in _Science_ relates the following rather startling\r\nexperiment in killing tree scale by poisoning the sap of the tree. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I have in my ground a plant of Spanish broom about a dozen years old\r\nand with a trunk about four inches in diameter which has for several\r\nyears been seriously infested by cottony cushion scale (_Icerya\r\npurchasi_). I have tried various sprays, have put scale-eating beetles\r\non the tree, and at one time cut all the branches off and sprayed the\r\ntrunk several times in the attempt to get permanently rid of this scale,\r\nbut up to last winter it seemed that all attempts were in vain. In\r\nFebruary of this year, when the broom was very thickly covered with the\r\nscale, I bored a three-eighths inch hole in the trunk to a depth of\r\nabout three inches, filled the hole nearly full of crystals of potassic\r\ncyanide, and plugged it up. In two days the scale began to fall from the\r\ntree and in a few days all appeared dead. Others hatched and attacked\r\nthe tree, but lasted only a short time, and the tree has since been free\r\nfrom scale and very vigorous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE OF SUMMER MEETING, 1916\r\n\r\nA JOINT SESSION OF THE MINNESOTA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND ITS\r\nAUXILIARIES, THE MINNESOTA STATE GARDEN FLOWER SOCIETY, THE MINNESOTA\r\nSTATE BEE KEEPERS SOCIETY AND THE MINNESOTA STATE FLORISTS SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nWill be held FRIDAY, JUNE 23rd, 1916, in the Gymnasium, at University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GYMNASIUM BUILDING in which this meeting is to be held has\r\nrecently been constructed and only finished suitable for the uses of\r\nthis gathering within the past year. The grounds about it are still in\r\npart in an unfinished condition. Directly south of this building are the\r\nfootball grounds, originally a marshy tract, now filled in and leveled\r\noff, with hillsides sloping upwards some thirty to forty feet on either\r\nside, well shaded. These slopes would be excellent places for the picnic\r\ndinner and the afternoon session except for the fact that they have\r\nrecently been seeded and are not yet in condition for use. The main room\r\nin the gymnasium building, which is a very large room--at least three\r\ntimes as large as the one occupied by our exhibit last year--will be\r\nused for the fruit and flower display, and exhibitors can have access to\r\nthis hall early in the forenoon, though visitors will be barred from the\r\nexhibition hall until 12:00 m. to give ample opportunity for placing and\r\njudging the display.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will remain in place undisturbed until 9:00 o'clock p.m.\r\nThe flowers will be distributed to the various hospitals in the Twin\r\nCities.\r\n\r\nTHE PREMIUM LIST accompanying this notice is practically the\r\nsame as last year, there being only a few minor changes, to which it\r\nwill not be necessary to refer here. The season, up to the time of\r\nwriting this notice at least, having been a favorable one we are\r\nanticipating a large display of flowers, probably the finest ever shown\r\nat any of our summer gatherings, and as the weather is always pleasant\r\non the occasion of our summer meeting a large gathering of members and\r\nvisitors is also assured.\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATIONS.--There will be a number of demonstrations at\r\nthe farm, one by Prof. Francis Jager, the apiculturist, at 11:30\r\no'clock, at the Apiary Building. No special subject has been announced\r\nfor this, but it is certain to be a profitable occasion for those\r\ninterested in bee culture. Professors connected with the entomological\r\nand pathological departments will conduct experiments in spraying at\r\nsome point near the Main Building. Undoubtedly there will be other\r\ndemonstrations, which may be announced before the meeting or in regard\r\nto which announcements will be found posted at the gymnasium.\r\n\r\nGUIDES TO THE GROUNDS.--Guides will be in attendance to escort\r\nvisitors about the grounds to various points of interest. These guides\r\nwill be prepared to answer questions pertaining to the various branches\r\nof educational work at the farm. Those who wish to take advantage of\r\nthis service will meet the guides at the gymnasium at 10:30 a.m. and\r\n3:30 p.m. The guides will wear suitable badges.\r\n\r\nPICNIC DINNER.--In regard to the picnic dinner, which will\r\noccupy the time between noon and 2:00 o'clock, we are not quite sure as\r\nto where it will be held, but probably near the dining hall. Should the\r\nweather be unfavorable of course there is plenty of room inside the\r\ngymnasium building. Lemonade, ice cold, will be provided in quantity at\r\nthe gymnasium building to meet the needs of the picnickers.\r\n\r\nAFTERNOON MEETING.--At 2:00 p.m. the afternoon session of the\r\nmeeting will be held at some point in or around the gymnasium building,\r\ndepending on the weather at that time and somewhat also on the weather\r\nbetween now and then as to the condition the grounds may be in.\r\n\r\nREACHING THE GROUNDS.--Take the Como-Harriet or Como-Hopkins\r\ncar in either St. Paul or Minneapolis, get off at Doswell Avenue, and a\r\nwalk of approximately one-half mile will bring you to University Farm\r\ngrounds. To reach the gymnasium go north on Cleveland Avenue, which is\r\nthe avenue running along the west side of University Farm, past the\r\nUniversity Farm buildings until you come to the last building, which you\r\nwill recognize as the gymnasium by its size. The grounds between\r\nCleveland Avenue and the gymnasium are in an unfinished condition, but\r\nvisitors will readily find their way across. If you prefer to ride all\r\nthe way to the grounds get off at Eustis Avenue, which the conductor\r\nwill point out to you. From that place cars run every fifteen minutes\r\ninto the Farm grounds, an extra fare of five cents being charged. Ask\r\nthe conductor to let you off at the gymnasium building, which you will\r\nreach from the street car after a short walk over ground still ungraded\r\nand where no special path has been provided. Getting off at that point,\r\nhowever, saves a long walk from the terminal station. If in doubt as to\r\nthe way, follow the sign of the arrow.\r\n\r\nVISIT TO STATE FRUIT-BREEDING FARM.--This farm is located at\r\nZumbra Heights, twenty-two miles west of Minneapolis on the Minneapolis\r\nand St. Louis railroad. The train leaves depot at 8:35 a.m. Return can\r\nbe made by way of Zumbra Heights landing on Lake Minnetonka and the lake\r\nsteamers via trolley line to Minneapolis, or by waiting until\r\nmid-afternoon a train can be secured returning to the city on the\r\nrailroad. One or more of the professors will go out Saturday morning,\r\nJune 24th, to accompany any who may desire to take advantage of this\r\nopportunity to visit the Fruit Breeding Farm in a body. There are many\r\nthings of interest there, the special timely feature at this season\r\nbeing the fruiting of a large field of No. 3 strawberries, which variety\r\ngives promise of being the coming commercial berry of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nENTRIES.--All entries must be received by the secretary not\r\nlater than Monday, June 19th. No entries whatever will be received at\r\nthe meeting. The exhibitors are urged to send in their entries at as\r\nearly a date as possible, under no circumstances later than the date\r\nnoted above. Entry blanks will be furnished by the secretary on\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nEXHIBITS.--All exhibits must be in place and properly labeled\r\nby 11:30 a.m. to compete for premiums. The exhibitors must be members of\r\nthe society and growers of the articles exhibited.

How often do you hear\r\nconcerning some gardener, that if he \"only touches a thing, it is bound\r\nto live?\" There is no \"king's touch\" in the garden game. People who\r\n\"love\" plants are more successful with them, merely because such persons\r\ntake greater care in handling them. The first essential in transplanting\r\nis to have good plants. They should be well hardened off (see March\r\nReminder, covering cold-frames); this applies to plants in flats and in\r\npots even more than to those growing in frames. In buying plants, select\r\nstocky, compact, dark colored ones in preference to very large ones.\r\n\r\nPREPARE THE SOIL as carefully as though you intended to sow\r\nseeds. Mark out the rows, and if fertilizer is to be used, mix it\r\nthoroughly with the soil before beginning transplanting. Then prepare\r\nthe plants carefully. Unless they are very small, cut back the largest\r\nleaves about one-half with an old pair of scissors. With a small trowel\r\nor an old knife, cut them out of the frame or flat in which they are\r\ngrowing, keeping as much soil as possible with each. (If not in flats,\r\ncut them out as you use them in the garden.) If they are in pots, knock\r\nthem out carefully and pack into flat for convenience in handling. Paper\r\npots, which produce the best plants, are not removed before planting.\r\nWater thoroughly the day before planting, so that the soil will be in\r\nthe best condition for handling; but for several days before planting,\r\nit is well to keep the plants \"on the dry side,\" as they will then\r\nre-establish themselves more quickly when set out.\r\n\r\n(To be continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTOMOLOGICAL NOTES\r\n\r\nBy F. L. WASHBURN, Professor of Entomology.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SILVER PRUNE IN BLOOM AT MINNETONKA.\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1916.--The writer has a small silver prune grafted on hardy\r\nroot, which he obtained from Mr. Arrowood, Nevis, Minn., now in bloom at\r\nhis experimental garden at Minnetonka--not many flowers, it is true, but\r\nin bloom just the same. This tree is not more than two feet high, and\r\nwas somewhat protected by a rabbit protector and high snow. Other plums\r\nin the Entomologist's orchard, (one acre) are now nearly full of bloom:\r\nHanska, Skuya, Opata and other Hansen hybrids, as well as trial plums\r\nfrom the University fruit breeding farm.\r\n\r\nWe have top worked this spring Hibernals, and Patten's Greenings with\r\nStark's Delicious, Grimes Golden, King David and Johnathan.\r\n\r\nOne-half of this land slopes sharply to the north and the other half\r\nmore gently to the south, clay, loam with clay subsoil, offering\r\nfavorable conditions for orchard work as well as work with grapes, small\r\nfruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nOf grapes we have started Concord, Worden, Moore's Early, Agawam,\r\nBrighton, Iona, Lindley, Salem, Barry, Herbert, Isabella, Green\r\nMountain, and others.\r\n\r\nWe have even had the temerity to try Loganberries from the Pacific\r\ncoast, and have some in fruit at present. A heavy covering of soil next\r\nwinter will possibly protect these plants during the cold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE PINE BLISTER RUST IN MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\nThis disease has just been found on a few White Pines in two Minnesota\r\nnurseries. The trees in one of these nurseries came from Wisconsin,\r\nshipped into that state from the east. Absolute identification has been\r\nfurnished by the Plant Pathology Division of the Agricultural College.\r\nThe state entomologist has already in the field a force of men who will\r\ninspect every nursery in the state where white pines are grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SPARROW PEST.\r\n\r\nWe have experienced some success in the use of a sparrow trap, catching\r\nfrom 11 to 25 in half a day. It must be noted, however, that this does\r\nnot occur every day, and further, that the young birds are most easily\r\ncaught. Both old and young evidently learn to avoid the trap. Another\r\nparty who has used this trap also reports success even greater than\r\nours. Other parties report an average catch of ten birds a day for\r\nnearly four months. One can also, if on a farm, resort to shooting them\r\nsingly, or, better, when gathered together feeding. In fact, they may be\r\nbaited with grain for a few days (preferably in the fall or winter) and\r\nprevious to the use of the shotgun. This accustoms them to gathering in\r\na close flock. Eggs and nests may be repeatedly destroyed, if placed\r\nwithin reach. A well-directed stream of water from a hose is helpful in\r\nmaking them desert their roosts, at least for a while.\r\n\r\nDearborn (Farmers' Bulletin No. 493, U.S. Dept. of Agr.) describes a\r\nnest-box trap. Sparrows may also be poisoned, but this calls for extreme\r\ncare. In this case it is interesting to learn that one experimenter fed\r\na large number of sparrows killed by poisoning to a pet cat with no ill\r\neffects to the latter.\r\n\r\nWe have picked them from cornices upon our house at dusk with the aid of\r\na small collecting gun or pistol, firing a very light charge of shot,\r\nbut found that the shot marred the house, and were therefore obliged to\r\ndiscontinue the practice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to trapping sparrows with approved sparrow traps the\r\nfollowing recipe has recently come to our notice:\r\n\r\n\"Feed good cracked corn a few days; then substitute poisoned cracked\r\ncorn made as follows: Soak one quart of cracked corn in water; take it\r\nout and let it get about half dry. Dissolve one ounce of strychnia in\r\nhot water. Soak corn in this until it swells and then dry completely.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN.\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMB HONEY, EXTRACTED HONEY, AND INCREASE.\r\n\r\n(Continued from May No.)\r\n\r\nColonies run for comb honey are very much inclined to swarm. Swarming\r\nwith the resulting division of forces is incompatible with profitable\r\ncomb honey production. The colony must be kept together for best\r\nresults. The following methods are used by well known beekeepers.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of the honey flow let the colony cast a natural\r\nswarm. After hiving the bees on starters or full sheets of foundation\r\nand giving them a little brood to prevent them from swarming out again,\r\nthe swarm is put in the place of the parent colony, which is removed to\r\none side two or three feet. The seventh day the old colony is moved over\r\nto the opposite side of the swarm two or three feet. Two weeks after,\r\nall the bees are shaken in front of the swarm, and the hive with wax and\r\nhoney removed. Thus the desire of bees for swarming has been satisfied,\r\nand the colony is still working together.\r\n\r\n2. Make a shaken swarm. During the dandelion honey flow add an\r\nextracting super to your comb raising colony to give bees room to store.\r\nAt the beginning of the honey flow set the whole hive a little aside and\r\nput a new bottom board on the place thus vacated. On this bottom board\r\nplace the extracting super from your colony. Find the frame with the\r\nqueen and put it in the middle of this new brood chamber, bees and all.\r\nThen shake all the bees from the old brood chamber into the new. The\r\nbrood in the old hive thus left orphans may be piled up on top of some\r\nweaker colony in your yard who will take care of it. Five such supers\r\nwith brood may be piled on top of one such colony, and they will be the\r\nstrongest in the yard for storing extracted honey during the basswood or\r\nother late honey flow. This honey will be very handy for feeding your\r\nbees in the fall and spring. Now add a comb honey super to your shaken\r\nswarm. Add more supers when necessary, below before July 4th, on top\r\nafter that date. Remove all comb honey supers at once at the end of the\r\nhoney flow to have them white and clean.\r\n\r\n3. When your colony is very strong at the beginning of the honey\r\nflow--about June 10th--remove the queen, either by killing her or by\r\nstarting a new colony with her with two frames of brood. The seventh day\r\ncut out all queen cells but one--be sure not to leave two. This will\r\nre-queen your apiary, will prevent swarming for that season, will put a\r\nlarge number of bees into the field--there being no larvae to feed, will\r\nprevent thousands of bees from being hatched after they are of no use as\r\ngatherers of honey, and the honey needed for raising those bees will go\r\ninto the supers.\r\n\r\n(Continued in July No.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE OF SUMMER MEETING will be found on pages 257-259 of this\r\nmagazine. Don't overlook it--and be sure to come. Great show of flowers\r\nand a fine day is assured--that is our record to date.\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETARY'S OFFICE during the summer month, will be open as\r\nusual except Saturday afternoon, but the secretary will be in regularly\r\nonly on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE ENTOMOLOGISTS REPORT ON NURSERY INSPECTION in 1915\r\nhas been issued as circular No. 37.

J.\r\nKunkel, of Kimball, Minn., writes under date of May 13th: \"The three\r\neverbearing strawberry plants I received of you in 1915 made about 250\r\nyoung plants, of which I replanted this spring about 200. We had a few\r\nberries, but did not expect berries as we let all runners grow.\"\r\n\r\nWho has done better than that in growing No. 1017 everbearing strawberry\r\nplants?\r\n\r\nA FARMER ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS.--We are much pleased to note\r\nthe appointment of a real farmer in the person of C. W. Glotfelter, of\r\nWaterville, as a member of the Board of Regents of the Minnesota State\r\nUniversity. Mr. Glotfelter is well known throughout the state as late\r\npresident of the Minnesota State Agricultural Society, and is at present\r\noccupying the same position with the Minnesota Crop Breeders'\r\nAssociation. He is a farmer in every sense, as he lives upon a farm\r\nwhich he has himself worked personally a great many years. We feel that\r\nthe horticultural and agricultural interests of the state are especially\r\nwell cared for by this board in having Mr. Glotfelter in its membership.\r\n\r\nWYMAN ELLIOT'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIBRARY.--A short time since\r\nMrs. Elliot, widow of the late Wyman Elliot, sent to this office as a\r\ncontribution to our library all of the horticultural and agricultural\r\nbooks which belonged to Mr. Elliot. There were in all 397 volumes,\r\nnearly all of them bound in cloth. The larger portion of these were\r\nreports of other horticultural and agricultural societies, most of which\r\nthe Horticultural Society already had in the library. There were,\r\nhowever, some forty or fifty very valuable reference books, or books on\r\nspecific subjects of a horticultural character, and a considerable\r\nnumber of reports of other societies which we did not have, in all\r\namounting to seventy-seven volumes. These have been placed mostly in two\r\ncases by themselves which will be marked with Mr. Elliot's name, and, of\r\ncourse, each one of these volumes has an inscription of similar\r\ncharacter on the fly leaf. The remainder of these books, 320 in number,\r\nare being sent to University Farm library for use there as far as they\r\nneed them, and they will be likely to know where to place to advantage\r\nany that they have no personal use for. There are plenty of libraries in\r\nthe state that would be glad indeed to receive some of these volumes,\r\nand we hope that in this way Mr. Elliot's name will appear in the\r\ncatalog of many of our public libraries.\r\n\r\nNEW LIFE MEMBERS.--There have been quite a number of names\r\nadded to the life membership roll of the society during the year 1916\r\nand since the last public record was made of this sort. The names of the\r\nfollowing persons have now been added to the permanent roll of the\r\nsociety: Ludvig Lima, Montevideo; Mrs. Florence Burlingame, Grand\r\nRapids; A.L.

These conferences deal with all of the problems of the grower, but\r\nspecial afternoons are given to the small fruits, the tree fruits, and\r\nvegetables. Next January will be the third conference of the fruit\r\ngrowers, the second for the vegetable growers, and the first for the\r\nsmall fruit growers as a separate branch of the fruit work.\r\n\r\nMr. W. G. Brierly, Chairman of the Division of Horticulture, University\r\nFarm, is working on programs for these conferences for next January. He\r\nwill be very glad to have any one interested write to him for\r\ninformation or to suggest topics for discussion. The program for the\r\nvegetable growers' conference will be drawn up by a joint committee from\r\nthe St. Paul and Minneapolis vegetable growers, working with Mr.\r\nBrierly. The committee is planning to meet at the time of the summer\r\nmeeting of the Horticultural Society and will, of course, welcome any\r\nsuggestions as to topics and speakers.\r\n\r\nThese conferences are for all growers interested and are free to all.\r\nThere has been some difficulty heretofore in that very few suggestions\r\nas to program have been offered by the growers themselves. If you have\r\nany problems or matters which you would like to have discussed at these\r\nconferences, now is the time to make your suggestions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH END OF EXHIBITION HALL AT LATE SUMMER\r\nMEETING.

W. LATHAM, SECY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something almost uncanny in the unbroken sequence of\r\npleasant days that have greeted the annual summer meeting of the\r\nHorticultural Society in the last quarter of a century. For days before\r\nthis meeting it seemed assured that we should this year at least have an\r\nunpleasant day for our gathering, and even the day before and night\r\nbefore were most unfavorable. Friday morning, June 23rd, however, opened\r\nup bright and beautiful, warm and pleasant, as nature can smile, and\r\ncontinued so throughout the day. The meeting was in accord with these\r\nfavorable circumstances, and I believe brought out more and better\r\nflowers and more, though no better, people, both as exhibitors and in\r\nattendance, than any previous similar gathering the association has\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was installed in the new gymnasium at University Farm, a\r\nroom sufficiently large so that it not only accommodated the exhibition\r\nwith wide aisle space, but also found plenty of room for the placing of\r\nchairs for the afternoon meeting. Tables were arranged around three\r\nsides of the hall, which were used for the displays of perennials and\r\nroses. The peonies were shown on several tables in the north center of\r\nthe hall and besides these there were exhibits of some of the choicest\r\nof the peonies made upon the floor, so arranged that visitors could walk\r\namongst them and look down upon them and see them at their best. One\r\ntable was occupied with the strawberry exhibit, which, however, was a\r\nsmall one on account of the lateness of the season, though the\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm showed some forty or fifty plates of No. 3, the new\r\nJune-bearing berry of such large popularity, and a few everbearers. The\r\nnumber of entries was, I believe, in excess of any previous meeting,\r\namounting altogether to 521. Most of the old exhibitors at our summer\r\nmeeting were present and some few of the newer ones. The effort which\r\nwas made this year to secure a completed exhibit at 11:30 proved to be a\r\nsuccess, and by the lunch hour the judges had gotten well along with\r\ntheir work and the hall was opened to the public to inspect the display.\r\n\r\nAt 12:00 o'clock or thereabouts the members and their friends gathered\r\nupon the lawn near the station dining hall, where there were plenty of\r\ntrees and green grass, and partook of the noon repast, for which purpose\r\nthe station provided coffee and also lemonade, the latter a new feature\r\nin our bill of fare.\r\n\r\nThe regular afternoon meeting was held at 2:00 o'clock in the same hall\r\nin which the exhibit was placed. This was largely attended, some two or\r\nthree hundred taking advantage of the opportunity to listen to those who\r\nfound place on this extempore program. Our society reporter took some\r\nnotes of what transpired at the meeting, but they were only partial\r\nnotes, and what here follows in regard to what took place is only in the\r\nnature of extracts.\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman was in the chair as usual and in a few words extended\r\ngreeting to the society saying, amongst other things:\r\n\r\n\"This occasion is always looked forward to with a great deal of\r\npleasure. We meet those engaged in similar lines of work, we discuss the\r\nproblems with which we have to contend, our joys and our sorrows. We\r\ncome here to meet our friends--and my experience has been that there are\r\nno truer or more loyal friends than those found amongst the\r\nhorticulturists. The true horticulturist is a lover of nature, a lover\r\nof the beautiful and all that goes with it. He looks for nothing except\r\nthe best that can be found in human kind. Such are the men and women\r\nthat belong to the Horticultural Society.\"\r\n\r\nAs representing the University Farm, whose hospitality in a large sense\r\nthe society was enjoying, Dean Woods gave us a hearty welcome in his\r\nhappy way, and what follows is typical of the kindly things he said: \"We\r\nalways have pleasant days and pleasant memories because those who study\r\nflowers and fruits and the beauties of nature are the ones from whom one\r\ncan get inspiration to understand and to know what nature means. Any one\r\nwho can listen to the sounds of nature, any one who can see in flowers\r\nthe spirit of life struggling upwards has the true spirit of the\r\nhorticulturist and is always welcome here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. A. Brackett, of Excelsior, being called upon, had something to say\r\nabout strawberry culture, and in the course of his remarks showed\r\nseveral plates of different varieties of strawberries. What follows is\r\nthe substance of his talk on this subject. \"We have here what we call\r\nthe No. 3 strawberry produced at the Experimental Farm. I believe from\r\nmy experience that it is going to take the place of all of our common\r\nJune-bearing strawberries. It is a deep rooter, fine large plant and a\r\nnice, solid berry, and I have never seen any blight or rust on the\r\nplants. I think that it will pay for all the expense that has ever been\r\npaid out for the farm, that one berry will pay for it, it will be of\r\nthat much value to the people of Minnesota. The everbearing strawberry\r\nhas come to stay, and for private use you do not need to plant any other\r\nvariety. The everbearing strawberry will ripen its fruit at least a week\r\nahead of almost any other berry we have, and then it will continue\r\nbearing until the frost kills it. I had at least twenty bushels of fruit\r\nfrom my plants last year, and I secured from one-quarter acre\r\nfifty-three cases and sold them at $4.80 a case. They talk about what\r\nthey can raise in California, but we can do better here, and I believe\r\nif you will stick to these three varieties, the Americus, Superb and\r\nProgressive, you will not need to plant any other variety. The Americus\r\nhas the best flavor but it isn't as large. Of the Superb nearly all of\r\nthe berries are large, very few small ones, but they haven't got the\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing about this new strawberry, it can not bear the year\r\naround, that is, during the summer, unless the ground is very rich. I\r\nthink I put on one-half acre of the everbearing strawberries twenty-five\r\nloads of fertilizer. You have got to make the ground rich to carry these\r\nplants through and produce the berries. I use a narrow row on the hill\r\nsystem. I cut my rows down in the spring, dig up the plants and leave\r\nthe row four inches wide and plants six inches apart. This brings more\r\nberries and better plants.\"\r\n\r\nProf. C. B. Waldron, of Fargo, N.D., horticulturist at the Fargo\r\nAgricultural College for a quarter century, who has rarely missed being\r\nwith us at any summer gathering, being called upon, among other things\r\nsaid: \"There are a good many things that affiliate people together in\r\ngroups of one kind or another. It used to be that if people had the same\r\nbelief about eternal punishment, etc., that they would group themselves\r\ntogether, but nowadays we find people grouping themselves according to\r\nmore natural methods. I think people grouping themselves together for a\r\ncommon love of trees, fruits and flowers makes a more natural bond of\r\naffiliation, and when I find a man that knows the names of many of our\r\nbeautiful flowers I feel drawn to him at once. I can't seem to tire of\r\nthat person's company, no matter what political party he belongs to.\r\nThese things that I speak of seem to be a more natural and harmonious\r\nrelationship to build our friendship upon than almost anything else. I\r\nknow that I always look forward days and weeks ahead to meetings like\r\nthis, where I can meet with people who love and admire and cherish the\r\nthings that I find my greatest delight in.\"\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the Fruit-Breeding Farm, Mr. Chas. Haralson, spoke\r\nbriefly of the work at the Fruit-Breeding Farm, which he is conducting\r\nwith such distinguished success. His statement was altogether too brief\r\nwhen one knows the vast amount of detail work that is being done there\r\nin development of new fruits: \"The work at the Fruit-Breeding Farm is\r\ncarried on just the same as usual. We are working on strawberries,\r\nplums, apples, grapes somewhat and several other fruits like\r\ngooseberries and currants. The best success we have had so far in the\r\nnew varieties is with strawberries, raspberries and plums. It takes only\r\na few years to run through a generation of these, and we can get them\r\nselected quicker than apples. The plum crop is very light this year,\r\nespecially on the hybrid plums, on account of winter-killing, that is,\r\nthe buds killed during the winter. They never did that before, but this\r\nyear they have done it to a great extent. The strawberry crop is very\r\ngood and so are the raspberries now coming on. Probably as many as 2,000\r\napple seedling trees are bearing this year, so we will have a little\r\nchance for selection in the line of apples. In grapes we are working\r\nwith most of the seedlings from the Beta and some hybrids, and we have a\r\nfew of the Beta seedlings that are very good. One red variety compares\r\nfavorably with any of the cultivated varieties. It is perfectly hardy so\r\nfar. And we have two or three varieties of black nearly as large as\r\nMoore's Early or Concord.\r\n\r\n\"We also have a number of seedlings of pears, but we are not very far\r\nadvanced with them yet. Pears stand the winter fairly well, although\r\nthey winter-kill to a certain extent. When they are weakened through the\r\nwinter and growth starts in the spring they blight. Blight is the worst\r\npart of our work with pears.\"\r\n\r\nProf. R. S. Mackintosh, of University Farm, was caught on the floor, and\r\nas usual took opportunity to tell people they ought to eat more apples\r\nand something about how to get them. This seems to be a subject that is\r\never in his mind and which he is persistently working to good advantage.\r\n\r\n\"You folks that are hungry and want apples or apple pie want to get busy\r\nabout the middle of August and eat up your surplus apples in Minnesota.\r\nIt is a shame that farmers, fruit growers, etc., have spent years trying\r\nto grow apples in Minnesota and then we cannot get enough people to eat\r\nthe apples. We are going to carry on the clearing house as we did last\r\nyear, and if you want apples let us know. We can grow apples the same as\r\nwe can grow peonies and strawberries, but it is a little hard to get\r\nthem distributed properly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. A. M. Brand, of Faribault, who had an extraordinary exhibit of\r\nseedling peonies at the meeting, pronounced by our peony expert, Mr.\r\nC.S. Harrison, \"second to none in the world,\" was introduced and talked\r\nbriefly along the line of seedling peony production, as follows: \"There\r\nis a great deal of encouragement in what we have been able to\r\naccomplish down there at Faribault along the line of producing something\r\nfine in peonies. Sixteen years ago we started out with the idea of\r\nimproving upon the stock that we already have. We had a little red\r\npeony, a very nice peony, originated by Mr. Terry down in Iowa, called\r\nRachel, and starting out with that as a mother plant we have produced\r\nsome of the finest roots that there are in cultivation. By using lots of\r\nthe seed of Rachel we have been able to produce this Mary Brand,\r\nconsidered by many of the peony growers as one of the finest red peonies\r\nin the world. A great many people that raise nice peonies think they\r\nhave to go to the trouble of hand fertilization. That isn't necessary.\r\nWe started out with such varieties as Rachel, and by letting the bees\r\nand the elements do the fertilizing for us we were able to produce\r\nvarieties like this. Here is the new seedling that we brought out this\r\nyear and named Ruth--a pink peony. As a rule we plant about a peck of\r\nseed every year, and out of that peck of seed it probably brings us\r\n10,000 seedlings, and out of this 10,000 we get one good seedling, and\r\nthis is the only good seedling that we have produced this year. This is\r\na seedling that comes from Rosa Fragrans. When we picked this seedling\r\nfrom the bed of seedlings we considered this the finest seedling that we\r\nhad, and it has never come good from that time to this, and it is ten\r\nyears since we have been trying this seedling, which will show you when\r\nyou are growing seedlings that the first time a seedling blossoms and\r\ncomes splendid you mustn't be too enthusiastic about it. The next year\r\nit may be worth nothing. You have got to try a seedling in every way to\r\nfind out whether it is worth sending out. As a rule it takes us ten\r\nyears from the time that a seedling first blossoms until we send it out.\r\nNinety per cent of all the peony seedlings that you grow will be\r\nsingles, one out of 10,000 seedlings will be fair and one out of 100,000\r\nseedlings will be extra good--so you see that those which we have\r\nproduced give us some encouragement. I wouldn't advise many of you to go\r\ninto the seedling business, although you might produce one good seedling\r\nout of a handful of seed.\r\n\r\n\"If you plant a peony on the lawn you have to fertilize it heavily. You\r\ncan't have your lawn right up to the stalks of the peony. If you want a\r\npeony on the lawn you must give it two feet of ground. Most of the\r\npeonies that are brought here are taken out of fields that are\r\ncultivated with a horse cultivator. If you want your flowers on the lawn\r\nand don't want to cultivate them you have to use lots of fertilizer. You\r\nmust not use too much. Fertilize heavy about once in three years. Don't\r\nfertilize every fall. Fertilize in the fall, and the next spring spade\r\nthe manure in and then don't use any manure for three or four years.\r\nPlant peonies any time from the first of September until the time it\r\nfreezes up and plant any time in the spring until the growth starts on\r\nthe plants. If you plant in the spring you are just six months ahead of\r\nplanting in the following September, though September is really the\r\nbest time to plant. If a peony clump becomes old, as large around as a\r\ntub, and you still want it to stand in the same place I would cut out\r\nhalf of the stalks as they come up, and then to get still larger\r\nblossoms after the stalks have come up I would pinch the side buds\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fringe of peonies at the summer exhibit.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford, of Indiana, a peony grower of much experience there, who\r\ncame to Minneapolis for the purpose of attending our flower meeting, we\r\nunderstand, told us something about how peonies are grown in her\r\nsection, an interesting and practical talk, part of which follows: \"In\r\nIndiana we have a sour, black clay soil. We fertilize with crushed\r\nlimestone and leaves. I fertilize with the leaves that fall in the\r\nautumn after the leaves have begun to rot. I cover them without cutting\r\nthe tops. Then in the spring when they begin to bud we go over them on\r\nour knees and work the leaves all in with a trowel. I have 3,000 plants,\r\nbut with the assistance of the men we have we get it done, and grow fine\r\npeonies. In regard to manure, I never feel that I can put any fertilizer\r\nwithin two feet. The rows are from three to four feet apart. We never\r\nuse any fertilizer that will come in contact with the stems, as when the\r\nflowers are cut off it leaves the stem hollow, and if the manure gets in\r\nthe stem it works down the stem into the roots and leaves a hollow root\r\nin time. We never use in our part of the state any fertilizer that will\r\ncome in contact with the stems except leaves. When the streets are\r\ncleaned in the fall I pile the leaves on the back lot. I have fourteen\r\nor fifteen loads hauled in. This is scattered over the peonies. I want\r\nto compliment you on having very fine peonies, some of them finer than I\r\nhave ever seen, and I hope you will all be as enthusiastic about raising\r\npeonies as I am. Is it necessary to burn the tops when they are cut off?\r\nI consider that the ashes from the tops aid in fertilizing. I pile them\r\nup in little piles and burn them and sprinkle the ashes over the\r\npeonies. Frequently when I dig around a peony and I feel that the soil\r\nhas become exhausted I throw in a handful of garden peas, and when they\r\nget about a foot high I spade them under for fertilizer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. D. W. C. Ruff, of St. Paul, had a wonderful showing of peonies of\r\nnamed varieties, most of them very expensive from a money standpoint,\r\nthey having cost him prices varying from $5.00 to $40.00 a root, and\r\njudging by the character of the flowers which he held up for the\r\naudience while he talked about them they were well worth the money. I\r\nregret that we are unable to give a verbatim report of his talk, with\r\nthe names of the varieties, but this information must be secured from\r\nhim at some later time. In part he said:\r\n\r\n     \"I have spent the last fifteen years in making a good\r\n     collection of peonies. I have gone all over the world for\r\n     peonies and have brought together some of the finest peonies\r\n     from all the noted growers and horticulturists. In my\r\n     collection I have over 400 hundred varieties, that is, what I\r\n     am growing at my home. I have brought here today of course a\r\n     great many peonies of the later varieties. I have brought these\r\n     here from an educational standpoint so that the people might\r\n     see some of the rare ones that they might have heard about or\r\n     read about and see them and know of these varieties. Last year\r\n     I made an exhibit and showed hundreds of them. This year I have\r\n     brought just a few choice things.\"\r\n\r\nRev. C. S. Harrison spoke in his usual inspiring way, but with such force\r\nand speed that our stenographer was unable to pick him up, which we\r\nsincerely regret. We all know Mr. Harrison as an enthusiast in flowers.\r\nHe has met with us year after year at both annual gatherings. While he\r\nis eighty-three years old yet what he has to say and the way he says it\r\nstill have the ring and inspiration of youth. He proposed the\r\norganization of a peony society for the Northwest, and a show of hands\r\nindicating there was material present to perfect such an organization\r\nthe plans were laid therefor. Our reporter got this far:\r\n\r\n\"I have attended the national peony shows of Boston and New York, and\r\nthey cannot hold a candle to your peonies, mark that! There is\r\nsomething in your soil and in your climate which brings them to the\r\nfront.\"\r\n\r\nProf. F. L. Washburn was to tell us something about the white pine\r\nblister rust, but he failed to inflict upon us a long technical talk,\r\nand from what he said all the reporter got was this, from which however\r\none could well judge what was in his thought. \"We have found in\r\nMinnesota a disease on the white pine called the 'white pine blister\r\nrust.' One stage of this disease is on the gooseberry or currant, that\r\nis, we find it now on the white pine and going to the gooseberry or\r\ncurrant. We went to the governor, state treasurer and state auditor and\r\nobtained $1,000 for use in fighting this besides our regular\r\nappropriation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. Underwood, of Lake City, without whom the program would be\r\nincomplete, spoke a few closing words as follows: \"We have had such a\r\nsplendid program, and I know you are anxious to look at these beautiful\r\nflowers, and all I have time to say, and a disposition to say, is that I\r\nthink we owe a great obligation to the Garden Flower Society, a splendid\r\norganization auxiliary to the State Horticultural Society. I think you\r\nought to all be members of that Garden Flower Society. It is a wonderful\r\nworking organization, and I think the ladies that are in charge of it\r\ndeserve a great deal of credit and should be complimented as being\r\nforemost on the program. There is a great deal that I could say, but I\r\nknow there isn't time for it, and I thank you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime many more visitors had come into the hall to view the\r\ndisplay, which continued on exhibition until 9:00 o'clock in the\r\nevening. Prof. Cady, who had general charge of the arrangements at the\r\nmeeting, reports that at least one thousand people saw the display, and\r\nwe think that it was well worth while to have kept it open until that\r\nhour. Representatives from a number of the hospitals were present after\r\nthe meeting and took the flowers away to be used to cheer the sick in\r\nboth Minneapolis and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of awards at this meeting were $178.75. A list of these\r\nawards with the names of the judges follows in a separate article. No\r\none person took any large amount of premiums, they were well distributed\r\namongst a dozen and a number of others who received smaller amounts.\r\nMrs. H.B. Tillotson, who has a wonderful flower garden near Eureka, Lake\r\nMinnetonka, received premiums of $17.00, which is the largest amount\r\npaid to any one person, although there were a number of others who\r\nreceived slightly smaller amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAward of Premiums, Summer Meeting, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSES.\r\n\r\nCollection, B.

KELLOGG, LAKE MILLS, WIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 6.--I have just spent four days with our friend Patten. He has\r\n7,000 surprises on seventeen acres of experiment orchard dating back to\r\n1868--every tree of the 7,000 has a history.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-eight years he has been working on the Chinese sand pear and\r\nhas brought out a race that is blight-proof, perfectly hardy and of good\r\nsize and quality. He is not yet satisfied, but has 5,000 cross-bred\r\nseedlings of many crosses that are about three feet high, ready for\r\ntransplanting in orchard rows next spring--and he has not room to set\r\nthem. The state of Iowa does not appreciate his labor or value the work\r\nhe has done and is doing; they are not giving him the money or men to\r\ncarry on this work.\r\n\r\nBeside the pear experiments he has hundreds of crosses of apples that\r\nare very promising and just coming into bearing. These are scattered all\r\nthrough that orchard of 7,000 trees, with the pears, and nearly as many\r\nplum crosses. Some plums are heavily loaded this year that are of\r\nwonderful value, and one of the great points is that they have escaped\r\nthe bad weather in blooming time, while all our standard varieties\r\nfailed--and I believe the hardiness of bloom will insure fruit on his\r\nbest kinds when others fail in bad weather.\r\n\r\nHe is breeding form of tree in all these fruits--see his paper in the\r\nlast volume of Iowa Hort. Report. His crop of apples is light, but many\r\ncrosses show some fruit. Some pears and plums are loaded.

At\r\nleast studies made a few years ago in Nebraska and Kansas indicate that\r\nwindbreaks are profitable. The state forester will soon study their\r\ninfluence in this state. It must be admitted that windbreaks occupy\r\nspace that could be profitably devoted to agricultural crops, and that\r\nthe roots of the trees and their shade render a strip of ground on\r\neither side of the windbreak relatively unproductive. Yet in spite of\r\nthese drawbacks, efficient windbreaks undoubtedly do more good than\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nThe windbreak reduces the velocity of the wind, and, consequently, the\r\nloss of soil water from evaporation from the soil surface and from the\r\nfield crops. This is equivalent to additional rainfall, just as \"a\r\ndollar saved is a dollar made.\" It seems from investigations made by the\r\nUnited States Forest Service that the greater yield of field crops and\r\napples behind the protection of a good windbreak is enough to warrant\r\nevery farmer in the prairie states in planting windbreaks.--W.J.\r\nMorrill, Colo. Agri. College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDSUMMER REPORTS, 1916.\r\n\r\nCollegeville Trial Station.\r\n\r\nREV. JOHN B. KATZNER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions of last winter were not any too favorable for\r\nplants and fruit trees. In fact the cold was at times severe and long\r\ncontinued, reaching its maximum with 38 degrees below for one day. The\r\ntotal subzero weather for the winter amounts to 489 degrees, of which\r\nJanuary figures with 285 and February with 168 degrees below. This is\r\nsome cold, no doubt, and yet our hardy fruit trees did not suffer. But\r\nother trees not quite hardy suffered more than usual. This is\r\nparticularly noticeable on my German pear seedlings. The wood of the\r\nbranches as well as of the stem had turned black down to the ground. All\r\nthe imported European varieties of pears are dead and ready for the\r\nbrush pile. Prof. N.E. Hanson's hybrid pears have suffered just a\r\nlittle. This, however, may be due to the unripe condition of the wood\r\nrather than to cold. They had been grafted on strong German pear stock,\r\nmade a vigorous growth and were still growing when the frost touched\r\nthem. Another season they may be all right. All our cherry trees, too,\r\nare almost dead and will be removed and their place used for a trial\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nIt was of great advantage to plants and trees that we had much snow,\r\ngiving them good protection in root and stem two feet up. But this deep\r\nsnow helped the rabbits also in reaching the lower branches of the apple\r\ntrees. They were very active during the winter months and did much\r\ndamage by biting off the buds and smaller twigs from those branches, but\r\ndid no injury to the bark of trees otherwise.\r\n\r\nSpring was rather cold and late. Up to the middle of May there was not\r\nmuch growth of any kind. But we started work at the station as soon as\r\nthe ground could be worked. Apple and plum grafts made last winter were\r\nset out. The orchard was gone over and trees pruned where needed. The\r\ngrape vines were uncovered and tied up on the trellis. A liberal\r\ndressing of manure was worked in around vines growing on poor soil. More\r\nthan a hundred Alpha grape vines were planted along a students' walk for\r\ntheir future benefit. The everbearing strawberries were looked after and\r\na new bed was started. Some apple trees were planted in the orchard to\r\nreplace others. Quite a number of German pear seedlings were grafted\r\nwith hardy varieties an inch below ground. We expect this will give us\r\nhealthy and hardy trees and fruit in due time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Patten's No. 108 in blossom at Collegeville Station.]\r\n\r\nA friend of mine sent me from Los Angeles, Cal., four fine large cherry\r\ntrees: the Tartarian, Napoleon Bigarreau and Early Richmond. These are\r\none year old budded trees; they have made in the congenial climate of\r\nCalifornia a growth of about eight feet and are an inch through the\r\nstem. They arrived the first week in March. It was cold yet and the\r\nground covered with a foot of snow. As we could not plant them, we\r\napplied water to the roots and kept the trees unpacked in the cool root\r\ncellar till planting time. They are growing now, but next spring we\r\nexpect to see their finish. Another variety of sweet cherries was sent\r\nto the trial station from the mountains of Pennsylvania and planted in\r\nthe nursery, but we expect that will meet the same fate. From the U.S.\r\nDept. of Agriculture we have obtained scions of a pear, No. 26485,\r\nwhich were used in budding some German pear seedlings, as also ten\r\nplants of Prunus Tomentosa No. 38856. This is a Chinese bush cherry, and\r\nthough the fruit is of little value, yet the plant is said to be quite\r\nornamental.\r\n\r\nIn forestry work 200 arbor vitae were set out, more for ornamental\r\neffect, and in open places of the woods several thousand Scotch pine\r\nwere planted. This planting was also extended partly around the opposite\r\nlake shore to improve the landscape during the winter months, when\r\neverything looks bleak and dreary.\r\n\r\nThis station has received quite a liberal supply of new stock for trial\r\nfrom the Minn. State Fruit-Breeding Farm, viz.: June bearing strawberry\r\nNo. 3, everbearing kind No. 1017, raspberry No. 4 and everbearing sorts\r\nNos. 30 and 31; of plums, Nos. 35, 9, 21, 1, and sand cherry crossed\r\nwith Climax; of apples, six Malindas, Nos. 38, 32, 29, 25, 12 and 12.\r\nThey are fine large trees and were planted in the trial orchard. Ten\r\nsmaller apple trees which we received were set out in the nursery and\r\nafter a year or two will find their place in the orchard. These trees\r\nare labeled: Gilbert, Winesap, Russet Seedling, then Nos. 90, 271, 269,\r\n16, 7045 and A1. All of this stock has been carefully planted and is now\r\ndoing well.\r\n\r\nThe only variety of fruit trees which bloomed before the 20th of May was\r\nthe Akin plum. Most all other trees were getting ready to bloom, but it\r\nwas really too cold for them to open their flowers. From that time on\r\nthe blooming became more general among the plums and later among the\r\napples. The trees which did not bear last year were full of flowers.\r\nSome of the new plums, too, had quite a number of blossoms, and we are\r\nwatching with great interest what the fruit will be, as we intend to\r\npropagate the best ones in a small way for home use.\r\n\r\nOf small fruits we have now on trial five varieties of raspberries and\r\nalso three sorts of strawberries, Nos. 3, 4 and Progressive. This will\r\ngive us a good chance to judge of their relative value as to hardiness,\r\nquality and quantity of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe truck garden is taken care of as usual, but is far behind other\r\nyears in growth and development of vegetables on account of the cold\r\nspring. If it were not for our greenhouse and hotbeds, I think we would\r\nyet be without radishes and lettuce.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said in regard to the planting of our lawns. The plants\r\nwere all ready in the greenhouse, but the planting had to be deferred as\r\nlong as there was danger of frost. The flower beds on the lawns were\r\nfinally planted, the designs are very good, but it will take some time\r\nyet till their beauty can be seen and enjoyed.\r\n\r\nJudging from present conditions, we may get a pretty good crop of\r\nfruits. The time for the late spring frosts passed by without doing any\r\nharm. The weather during blooming was favorable for setting a good crop\r\nof apples and plums. The grapes, too, show up well and promise a good\r\ncrop, and the strawberries and currants are doing splendidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeffers Trial Station.\r\n\r\nDEWAIN COOK, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 13.--_Plums_--Much rainy weather during the blooming period was\r\nundoubtedly the main reason why the plum crop of 1916 will not amount to\r\nvery much. Only a few of the Americana have set any fruit whatever.\r\nHowever, the Terry and the Wyants carry considerable fruit.\r\n\r\nOf the Japanese hybrids the B.A.Q. and Emerald have set some fruit--also\r\nthe Stella. Of the hybrid plums originating at the Minnesota State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm there are only a few scattering specimens on any of\r\nthem. Most of them have set no fruit whatever. Minn. No. 6, one tree, is\r\nin a dying condition from winter-killing.\r\n\r\nHansen's hybrids have mostly set some fruit, but not freely. The Hanska,\r\nToka, Opata and Wohanka are among those varieties making the best\r\nshowing of fruit.\r\n\r\nWhile in a general way we consider the rains during the blooming period\r\nresponsible for the almost failure of the 1916 plum crop, but, to be a\r\nlittle more specific, the blight of the plum bloom, or rather the brown\r\nrot fungus, was more generally prevalent and more generally destructive\r\nthan at any previous season. As for the fungous disease known as plum\r\npocket, we have not seen one this season. It has been entirely absent.\r\n\r\nAs for spraying to control the brown rot fungus, we have and are doing\r\nthe best we know. With the exception of about twenty-five large plum\r\ntrees that we have made into a hog pasture and could not get at very\r\nwell with our gasoline spraying outfit, we sprayed about all our plum\r\ntrees (and other fruit trees as well) twice before blooming, once just\r\nas the fruit buds began to swell and again just before they bloomed,\r\nwith lime-sulphur solution. We are now spraying the third time, adding\r\narsenate of lead to the lime-sulphur.\r\n\r\nOf grapes sent me from our State Fruit-Breeding Farm all varieties are\r\nlooking fine. The Beta we gave no winter protection, but all of the\r\nothers we covered with strawy manure. We did this as all the other\r\nvarieties winter-killed the first winter after planting, and we did not\r\nlike to take any chances with them.\r\n\r\nMinn. No. 3 strawberry is doing itself proud. We consider it the best\r\nall round variety we have ever grown and are planting almost exclusively\r\non our own farm.\r\n\r\nThe everbearing Minn. 1017 continues to hold place as first best. We set\r\nout some 400 plants of this variety this spring, and they are making\r\nrunners freely. Judging from last season, we expect a large crop of\r\nfine fruit from them next September, as well as a great quantity of new\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nApples are in a very satisfactory condition. I need to say but little\r\nabout varieties. All kinds of bearing size bloomed full, and most kinds\r\nhave set full of fruit. Of such kinds as Okabena, Duchess and Wealthy,\r\nit looks as though practically every blossom turned into an apple.\r\n\r\nWe received several seedling apple trees from Mr. Chas. Haralson, of the\r\nState Fruit-Breeding Farm. They were all set out, and all are growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Crescent Trial Station.\r\n\r\nD. C. WEBSTER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 17, 1916.--We received this spring, from the Fruit-Breeding Farm,\r\nplants for trial as follows: Malinda Nos. 12, 25, 29, 32, 38, 269,\r\nRussett Seedling, Gilbert Winesap, Nos. 7045, No. 90, No. ----, No. A 1,\r\neverbearing raspberry Nos. 30, 31, and strawberry No. 3. We also\r\nreceived from other sources Waneta and Lokota plum. Everything received\r\nfor trial this year lived and is growing well.\r\n\r\nOf the plums received in 1914, No. 6 died last winter. Those remaining\r\nabout all bloomed, but only a very little fruit set on the following:\r\nNos. 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 20. Native plums have set no fruit this year.\r\n\r\nApple trees top-worked last year did poorly. The trees worked two years\r\nago did finely and already have quite the appearance of real apple\r\ntrees. Some are setting fruit this year, and we anticipate a few fine\r\nspecimens of Jonathan and Delicious this fall from them.\r\n\r\nIn the orchard which blighted so badly two years ago, several trees died\r\nfrom that cause. A great many are in a ragged condition from the pruning\r\nnecessary, and we note with considerable anxiety the occasional\r\nappearance of that dreaded enemy a few days ago.\r\n\r\nLast year we had what might be called a full crop of apples, and\r\nconsequently did not expect them to do much this year. However, they had\r\na fairly good bloom, and about one-half of the trees have set a fair\r\ncrop. We sprayed twice with so far satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nStrawberries in this vicinity were badly injured by ice in winter where\r\nnot covered. Ours were covered and now promise a good yield. Began\r\npicking the 14th inst.\r\n\r\nWe set quite a patch of everbearers No. 1017 this spring. They bore last\r\nfall but chickens picked most of the berries. Superb were unsatisfactory\r\nand winter-killed where not covered.\r\n\r\nCarrie gooseberry has set full of berries and plants look fine.\r\n\r\nAll other trees and shrubbery in general at this station are in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandan, N.D., Trial Station.\r\n\r\n(Northern Great Plains Field Station.)\r\n\r\nW.A. PETERSON, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll plants at this station went into the winter with favorable soil\r\nmoisture conditions. Many plants, however, made a late growth and were\r\nstill in growing condition late in September.\r\n\r\nThe winter was a long and severe one, although there was more snow than\r\nusual. The early spring was severe, being both windy, cold and dry. Up\r\nto date (June 9th) there have been very few calm days. Three or four\r\nvery severe dust storms did considerable damage by blowing out seeds and\r\nblighting the tender new growth of many plants.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1915-16 in this section can be called a test winter, as\r\nmuch winter-killing both in root and top has resulted.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the apple and plum orchard (60% to 75%) killed\r\nout. There was no mulch or protection in these orchards. Practically all\r\ngrapes killed out, even though protected. A few Beta are alive at the\r\ncrown. Asparagus (unprotected) suffered severely. All raspberries had\r\nbeen covered with dirt. They came through perfectly and promise a good\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nStrawberries wintered successfully. The South Dakota variety came\r\nthrough perfectly, even when not mulched. All are in full bloom now.\r\nPractically all of Prof. Hansen's plum hybrids killed out entirely, or\r\nare dead to trunk or crown.\r\n\r\nA large number of seedlings of Chinese apricot, Chinese peach, native\r\ngrapes, Juneberries and bullberries passed through the winter with\r\nlittle or no injury. About 1,000 Beta seedlings, lined out as one year\r\nseedlings in the spring of 1915, winter-killed, with the exception of\r\nabout seven or eight plants.\r\n\r\nParadise apple stocks wintered safely.\r\n\r\nSoft maples that winter-killed to the ground in the preceding year are\r\ngood to the tips this spring, even though they had made four to six feet\r\nof new growth last summer.\r\n\r\nMany new plantings have been made this spring, especially along\r\nplant-breeding lines. Extensive experiments have also been started with\r\nfruit trees, shelter-belt trees, ornamental shrubs and perennial\r\nflowering plants to determine the factors that influence the hardiness\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\nStrawberry No. 1017, from the Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm, made an\r\nexcellent showing in 1915, and all plants bore some fruit. Only a few\r\nrunners were made, however. All plants were potted in fall, so no data\r\nhas been secured on their hardiness. Several hundred more plants of this\r\nvariety were set out this spring and they made an excellent stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMontevideo Trial Station.\r\n\r\nLYCURGUS R. MOYER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Syringa Japonica._--The Japanese tree lilac has often been recommended\r\nby this station, but last winter was unusually severe, and an old tree\r\nobtained from Prof. Budd, nearly thirty years ago, now shows several\r\ndamaged branches. Younger trees on our grounds and in the city parks\r\nshow no injury. Perhaps this tree cannot be expected to live to be much\r\nmore than thirty years of age nor attain a much greater height than\r\nthirty feet. The old tree is throwing up new stems from its roots and\r\nmay rejuvenate itself.\r\n\r\n_Caragana._--The small shrubby caragana (Caragana pygmaea) was unusually\r\nfine this spring when in full bloom. We received it from Prof. Budd many\r\nyears ago. It does finely in the clay banks of Lincoln Parkway in this\r\ncity, but it is seldom offered by nurserymen. Caragana frutex, formerly\r\ncalled Caragana frutescens, is a somewhat taller shrub and not quite so\r\nfloriferous. It makes a fine screen. Both of these shrubs are addicted\r\nto root sprouting, and might not please those who care for a stiff,\r\nformal garden. Both may be readily propagated from root cuttings.\r\n\r\n_Roses._--Hansen's Tetonkeha rose at this writing is in full bloom and\r\nis a very striking object. It grows to the height of about four feet and\r\nneeds no protection. The flowers are large and of a deep pink color. It\r\nseems to be as hardy as the old yellow rose of our gardens, that rose\r\nbeing now, too, at its best. Among other garden roses Paul Neyron is in\r\na rather weak condition, Ulrich Brunner is doing a little better, while\r\nMme. Georges Bruant is doing still better. Rosa pratincola grows on our\r\ngrounds naturally, and we have brought in from the edges of the timber\r\nRosa Engelmanni and Rosa Maximilliani. A friend in Duluth has sent us\r\nRosa Sayi, and we obtained Rosa Macounii from the Bad Lands of North\r\nDakota. These roses, as well as the more common Rosa blanda, make an\r\ninteresting addition to the hardy border.\r\n\r\n_Delphinium Formosum._--We obtained a plant or two of the old tall\r\nlarkspur almost thirty years ago. The old plants persisted several\r\nyears, and seedlings have grown up from self-sown seed, and the\r\nplantation is now as attractive as ever.\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemum Uliginosum._--The giant daisy has been here for a long\r\ntime and needs but little attention. The clumps should be taken up and\r\ndivided occasionally. It is one of our best late fall flowers.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphus._--Philadelphus pubescens came through the winter without\r\ninjury. Philadelphus zeyheri suffered a little. Philadelphus coronarius\r\ncame through in fair condition in a rather protected border, but\r\nPhiladelphus Lemoinei was frozen back nearly to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Giant daisy, or chrysanthemum uliginosum.]\r\n\r\n_Physocarpus._--Physocarpus opulifolius came through the winter with no\r\nmore than its ordinary injury.\r\n\r\n_Lonicera._--The old climbing honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens) came\r\nthrough the winter very much damaged, but our native honeysuckle is in\r\nfine condition. The bush honeysuckles are all hardy. The one known as\r\nLonicera bella alba does not differ very much from the common white form\r\nof the Tartarian honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n_Prunus Triloba._--The double flowering plum has always been hardy with\r\nus, and usually has been a splendid bloomer in the latter part of April,\r\nbut last winter was so severe that it did not bloom at all this spring.\r\n\r\n_Catalpa._--Another strange feature of the winter was that Catalpa\r\nspeciosa came through entirely uninjured.\r\n\r\n_Viburnum._--Viburnum pekinensis came through in fine condition as well\r\nas its close relative, the high bush cranberry. The common snowball did\r\nnot suffer so much from aphis this year as usual. Viburnum lentago,\r\nwhich grows in the river valleys here naturally, is doing finely.\r\n\r\n_Syringa._--Among the bushy lilacs Syringa ligustrina, Syringa\r\nChinensis, Syringa josikea and Syringa villosa all bloomed fully. The\r\nvarieties of the common lilac, known as Ludwig Spaeth, Charles X,\r\nSenator Vollard and the one that Prof. Budd brought from Russia and\r\ncalled by him Russian lilac, were all very satisfactory. This last\r\nvariety has pink flowers and is a very choice variety of Syringa\r\nvulgaria.\r\n\r\n_Amelanchier._--The large Juneberry, probably Amelanchier Canadensis,\r\nwas a very attractive object in April, when its purple-colored young\r\nleaves contrasted with its white bloom. The dwarf Juneberry, with their\r\nvillous young leaves and white flowers, are very attractive in April and\r\nshould receive more attention from our planters.\r\n\r\n_Dictamnus._--The gas plant (Dictamnus fraxinilla) becomes more\r\nattractive from year to year. It is one of the hardy plants which needs\r\nscarcely any attention to keep the weeds away. The pink form is very\r\nshowy when in flower, and the plant is very attractive after the flower\r\nis gone.\r\n\r\n_Iris._--A rather large collection of Siberian iris is very attractive\r\njust now. The city has found it a very desirable, hardy plant to set in\r\nthe park.\r\n\r\n_Apples._--A very good tree for park planting seems to be the crabapple,\r\nknown as Malus seboldii. It is very attractive when in bloom, and the\r\nfruit as it ripens takes on a rich warm color that is very interesting.\r\nOkabena is promising a light crop, which may be advantageous, as when\r\nthis variety bears freely the apples are apt to be undersized. A\r\nThompson seedling is promising a full crop as well as most of the other\r\ncommon varieties. The Wealthy on Malus baccata is bearing a full crop.\r\n\r\n_Hybrid Plums._--The common varieties of plums are promising a very good\r\ncrop, except Surprise, which is not bearing at all this year. Minnesota\r\nNo. 10 is the only one of the new seedlings bearing a full crop. No. 18\r\nhas a light crop. No. 8 is thrifty and promising and so is No. 10. No.\r\n20 suffered from the winter. Plums No. 1 and 2 are both promising. Plum\r\nNo. 11 was injured by the rabbits. Hansen's No. 3769, Sansota, is\r\nbearing a light crop.\r\n\r\n_Raspberries._--Raspberry No. 8 is promising a full crop. It is a very\r\nlate variety. Hansen's Oheta is one of our best berries.\r\n\r\n_Gooseberries._--Western Minnesota is not well adapted to the\r\ncultivation of gooseberries, nor do currants do very well. The Carrie\r\ngooseberry is promising a full crop, and some of the older varieties are\r\ndoing better than usual, perhaps on account of the unusually cool\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevis Trial Station.\r\n\r\nJAS. ARROWOOD, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 16, 1916.--Apples came through the past winter in fairly good\r\nshape, especially the stock we have grown at this place. There has been\r\nsome loss with stock that has been brought from outside nurseries from\r\ntop killing, and there have been some sun scalds where trees have been\r\nexposed to the southwest sun, mostly among the limbs and crotches. There\r\nwill be a fair crop of apples, as they seem to be setting fairly good.\r\nThere has been considerable top-working done this spring with fair\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. James Arrowood alongside a seedling of the\r\nTranscendent in early bloom.]\r\n\r\nOur native plums have all come through the winter in good shape, with\r\nonly a small setting of plums, on account of so much rain. In regard to\r\nthe plums we received from the Breeding Station in 1913: the number of\r\nplums was eighteen; all grew except two, and those killed back each\r\nyear. They were No. 2. All the rest have grown, but no fruit up to date\r\nexcept on No. 7. That fruited last year and also is loaded with fruit at\r\nthis date. The trees received in 1914 all grew except two. They all made\r\na fair growth but haven't yet set any fruit. The dozen trees that were\r\nsent me in 1915 have all made a good growth this last year.\r\n\r\nTwo dozen grapes that were sent to me three years ago have not set fruit\r\nbut have made a slow growth. Now in regard to small fruit, such as\r\nstrawberries, we wish to say that No. 3 heads everything in the\r\nstrawberry line for growth and berries. Its equal is not found in this\r\nsection of the country. In regard to the everbearing we cannot say that\r\nthey have done as well as we expected them to. The raspberries that we\r\nreceived three years ago have all done very well. No. 1 and No. 5 have\r\ndone the best. Those berries have all stood out without covering through\r\nthe winter. We have one acre of them now. They have not killed back at\r\nall and promise a big crop.\r\n\r\nWe received this spring about one dozen apple trees which we will report\r\non later. Currants and gooseberries promise a good crop.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the shade trees and the evergreens they have all done\r\nremarkably well. We have more faith in the seedling fruits, such as\r\napples and plums, for this section of the country. We believe our only\r\nhope will be through the seedlings. This was the late Prof. Green's\r\nprediction to me just before his death. Every year brings to mind his\r\nsaying, that we must plant our own apple and plum seed if we ever expect\r\nany good results in Northern Minnesota.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Hansen plums--all seem to be doing well and are set\r\nfull of fruit. We would also mention the Hansen sweet alfalfa, which is\r\na wonder. It grows and spreads equal to quack-grass. Four years ago we\r\nreceived fifty plants, which were planted according to directions of the\r\nprofessor to set two feet apart and cultivate the first year. During\r\nthese four years it does not appear that there has been a single plant\r\nkilled out. It has spread from the seed and roots over two rods wide and\r\nsix rods long and as thick as it can stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOwatonna Trial Station.\r\n\r\nTHOS. E. CASHMAN, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is but little to report from the Owatonna Station at this time.\r\nTrees and plants came through the winter in good condition. The apple\r\ntrees, Haralson's plum seedlings, No. 1017 everbearing strawberry, No. 4\r\nraspberry and Beta grape seedlings came through the winter without\r\ninjury. Trees that are old enough have blossomed well and are carrying a\r\nfair crop of fruit.\r\n\r\nA new lot of seedlings originated by Mr. Haralson at the Fruit-Breeding\r\nStation have been planted this year, and the station this year put in\r\nthe following: Malinda Nos. 12, 17, 13, 58, 32, 29, 7, 18, 25, 3, 35,\r\n38, W. 82; Malinda seedling, W. 132; Hilbut, Winesap, W. 79, No. 16, No.\r\n269, W. 81, W. 100, W. 184, No. 90, W. 20 G., No. 243; No. 31\r\neverbearing raspberries, Russet Selly, W. 36, W. 135, No. 272. They are\r\nstarting off in good shape and will all make a good showing for the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\nWe have done the usual spraying, first with lime-sulphur and a small\r\nportion of arsenate of lead while the trees were dormant, and just\r\nlately a good dose of arsenate of lead. The foliage of the trees is\r\nperfect, and bugs of all kinds are conspicuous by their absence. People\r\nwho have not sprayed find their trees badly stripped of foliage. I am\r\nafraid of severe losses unless they get busy very soon. Spraying costs\r\nbut little and must be done if we are to raise fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaynesville Trial Station.\r\n\r\nFRANK BROWN, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plums sent to this station the spring of 1914 wintered very nicely,\r\nblossomed very full and have set considerable fruit. The new growth on\r\nthese trees is very satisfactory, and they seem to be healthy in all\r\nways.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 plum trees sent here last spring froze back quite badly, but as\r\nmany other supposedly hardy trees did the same we are still in hopes\r\nthat this was only an incident in a hard winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A corner of the home orchard at the Paynesville Station.]\r\n\r\nNo. 4 raspberry is still a favorite here; it winters perfectly, is a\r\nstrong grower, and a good all around berry, both as a home berry, and as\r\na shipper.\r\n\r\nRaspberries Nos. 2 and 7 are both good, but No. 2 lacks a little in\r\nhardiness, and we wish to test No. 7 more fully before reporting. The\r\nother raspberries, Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6, are no good here.\r\n\r\nIf I knew how to say more in favor of that grand strawberry Minn. No. 3\r\nI should say it; with us it is the best of all the June-bearing berries,\r\nhardy, productive, a good canner and a good shipper.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1915 we received from the Central Station fifty plants\r\nlabeled Minn. No. 1017. We considered it our duty to test these in all\r\nways, so kept all berries picked off until July 1st, then allowed fruit\r\nand plants to form as they would, and the result was an immense crop of\r\ndark red fruit, of the finest quality, and over 600 strong, sturdy\r\nplants. These were transplanted this spring without the loss of a single\r\nplant, and at this date are certainly a fine looking bunch.\r\n\r\nThe apple trees received this spring from the Central Station are all\r\ndoing well. The trees and plants from that Station certainly speak\r\nvolumes for the work being done by Supt. Haralson.\r\n\r\nSome trees and shrubs killed back quite badly the past winter,\r\nespecially spirea Van Houtti was badly hurt.\r\n\r\nFruit prospects are good, the cold backward spring held the fruit buds\r\nback until all danger of frost was over.\r\n\r\nStrawberries are especially fine this season, and bid fair to be a\r\nrecord crop. In fact, the horticulturists in this part of our state have\r\nmuch to be thankful for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSauk Rapids Trial Station.\r\n\r\nMRS. JENNIE STAGER, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 13--Starting with a late spring, which saved all sorts of blossoms\r\nfrom the frost, now in June we have promise of an unlimited amount of\r\nfruit. But with heavy rains almost every night, we cannot effect much\r\nwith spraying. One spraying eliminated all worms so far from not only\r\nthe currants and gooseberries, but the roses also, and once going\r\nthrough the orchards has done away with the few tent caterpillars that\r\nhad started in their work.\r\n\r\nSo on the whole we have hopes of a full harvest of not only tree but\r\nsmall fruits. Most vegetables are backward, as also flowers from seeds,\r\nbut with so much to be thankful for how can any of us complain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALLEGED PEAR BLIGHT CURES ARE WORTHLESS--ORGANISM OF DISEASE LIVES\r\nUNDERNEATH BARK OUT OF REACH OF \"CURE.\"--Fruit growers should not\r\nallow themselves to be induced to purchase and use worthless pear blight\r\ncures. Every year we hear of cures for pear blight being sold to fruit\r\ngrowers, but to the present time the experiment stations of the country\r\nhave hunted in vain for any practical remedy that may be sprayed upon\r\ntrees or used in any way for the cure of this typo for disease. The\r\norganism lives underneath the bark entirely out of reach of remedies\r\nthat may be applied to the surface of the tree.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend to fruit growers that they do not spend any\r\nmoney for pear blight until they are able to learn through experiment\r\nstations, or the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D.C., that\r\nthere is a remedy that can be used for the control of this\r\ndisease.--C. P. Gillette, Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Concord Trial Station.\r\n\r\nFRED COWLES, SUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 14.--The past winter was long and severe. Besides the severe cold,\r\na heavy coat of ice remained a long time on trees of all kinds, causing\r\nmuch anxiety, but when the time came trees of all kinds were full of\r\nbloom and beauty. Most varieties of apples have set a full crop of\r\nfruit. Some trees which bore a heavy crop last year have little or none\r\nthis year, but the general crop of apples will be heavy if it matures.\r\nOur trees top-worked to Jonathan and Northern Spy are bearing good this\r\nyear; they show no signs of winter-killing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side view of Mr. Cowles' home grounds.]\r\n\r\nPlums were full of bloom as usual, but have set little fruit. Some\r\nvarieties--Sansota and Wyant--have a few scattering plums. Seedling No.\r\n17 also has a few. The new seedlings from the Station are all growing\r\ngood. The native plums in a thicket have more fruit than the named\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nStrawberries have wintered well and give promise of a full crop. Some\r\ngarden patches in the vicinity winter-killed badly. Minnesota Seedling\r\nNo. 3 promises to be a good berry; the strong fruit stems keep the\r\nberries from the ground. The Progressive and Superb, of the everbearing\r\ntype, are no longer an experiment, but are a success, and many farmers\r\nare planting them.\r\n\r\nRaspberries winter-killed some. The Herbert seems as hardy as any.\r\nSeedling No. 4 is also hardy. Gooseberries and currants are bearing as\r\nusual. Grapes have started rather late and will have a short season to\r\nmature.\r\n\r\nThe early flowering shrubs bloomed very full this spring. Lilacs did\r\nextra well. The Persian lilac was very full and lasted a long time.\r\nChas. X, Madam Chereau and Alphonse la Valle were fine. Villosa is just\r\ncoming out; this is a beautiful variety. The tree lilac received from\r\nChina a few years ago is going to bloom for the first time. The iris is\r\njust in full bloom, and the delicate colorings always please. Peonies\r\nare late this year, none being out at this time. A few Rugosas are the\r\nonly roses out at this time, but they look promising for a little later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrcharding in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION LED BY PROF. RICHARD WELLINGTON, UNIVERSITY FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I want to set out 500 trees; what kind shall I set out? I\r\nlive at Zumbra Heights.\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: I would prefer some of the more experienced growers to\r\nspeak on that question, but going over the recommendations of over 160\r\ngrowers the Wealthy is recommended in practically all cases in\r\npreference to the other varieties. We know, however, that the Wealthy\r\nneeds pollen from other varieties for fertilization of the blossom, so\r\nit would be foolish to put out 500 Wealthys. It is better to mix in some\r\nof the other varieties. If I was planting an orchard, probably\r\nseventy-five per cent. of the apples would be Wealthys.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: And what next?\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: Well, that depends altogether on your market. If you can\r\nhandle the Duchess apple, work the Duchess in; or if you wanted a few\r\nlate apples, work in some of the other varieties.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Isn't the Okabena better than the Duchess?\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: It is a little later.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Four days later.\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: That would be my recommendation. I would put in the\r\nmajority of the trees Wealthys and then work in some other varieties\r\naccording to your market.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Isn't the Malinda and the Northwest Greening all right?\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: The Northwest Greening seems to be especially valuable\r\nin certain parts of the state. In some parts they winter injure, but it\r\nis a good late variety.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: How is the Malinda?\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: Malinda is all right excepting in quality. It is lacking\r\nin quality.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Is it a good seller?\r\n\r\nMr. Wellington: I couldn't tell you about that. Some of these other\r\ngentlemen could give you information on that point. It tastes more like\r\ncork than anything else, but after the other apples are gone we are not\r\nso particular about it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: The speaker brought out one point that we tested out a great\r\nmany years ago in Illinois, and I suppose it is really an important one\r\nhere, and that is the protection against the winds with shelter-belts.\r\nNow, at the University of Illinois they planted out some forty acres to\r\ntest that with all the varieties they could get together, and they\r\nplanted spruce trees not only on the outside of the orchard but they\r\nplanted them in through the orchard, dividing the orchards up into ten\r\nacre plots. Quite a number of the early planters of apples in Illinois\r\nalso put windbreaks around their orchards with considerable detriment to\r\ntheir orchards.\r\n\r\nWe find that we need air drainage there just as much as we need\r\nprotection against the wind. If I were in Minnesota I might change my\r\nmind after studying the conditions, but if I was going to plant in\r\nMinnesota and I should plant evergreens I certainly would trim them up\r\nfrom the bottom so as to get air drainage. I have known of instances\r\nwhere orchards were protected and where there was air drainage they were\r\nall right, but where they were closely protected by the trees they were\r\ninjured by the frosts by their starting too early in the spring. If you\r\nget a warm atmosphere around the trees you start your buds pretty early,\r\nseveral days earlier than they would if they had the right kind of air\r\ndrainage, and it does seem to me that the experience we have had would\r\nbe against close planting around an orchard for protection from frost,\r\nthough you do want to protect them against winds, but air drainage, it\r\nseems, is not a detriment to orchards. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I wish to say that in my observation and my experience\r\nif I was putting in a windbreak I would put it on the south and west\r\nsides; I wouldn't have any on the north and east.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Our prevailing winds are from the south and west during\r\nthe summer, and the Wealthy is an apple that is bad for falling off when\r\nit gets to a certain stage, and I think it is very necessary for us to\r\nhave a windbreak on the south and west if we are going to protect our\r\norchards here.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: The wind comes from the northwest generally in the winter,\r\nwhen we have storms, and if snow falls and it comes from the northwest,\r\nand the orchard is protected on that side by a windbreak, the windbreak\r\nwill catch the snow and it will pile on top of the orchard, and I have\r\nknown at least a dozen trees to be broken down by the storms of winter\r\ngetting in that way.\r\n\r\nA Member: I think crab apple trees make a good windbreak, if they are\r\nset twice as close together as trees in the orchard.\r\n\r\nA Member: I think location has more to do with it than anything else. I\r\nhave two or three orchards in mind where five years ago, when we had\r\nthat hard frost, they had an abundance of apples, and it was protected\r\nfrom the northwest. I have another orchard in mind that was protected\r\nfrom the north and northwest, and this year they had over 1,400 bushels\r\nof Wealthy apples. Mine wasn't protected particularly from the north,\r\nand I had no apples, but back of the buildings, there is where I had my\r\napples. I tell you location has more to do with it than a windbreak in\r\nsuch a case.\r\n\r\nMr. Drum: You all remember some ten or more years ago when the apple\r\ntrees were in blossom, and we had a terrible snow storm and blizzard and\r\nfreeze. My orchard was protected both from the southwest and the\r\nnorthwest and the north, and following that freeze my trees had the only\r\napples that were left in that country. I think that protection from the\r\nnorth and northwest is just as essential, especially in a position where\r\nthe winds have a wide sweep. My house and my orchard slope off to the\r\nnorthwest, and I have a full sweep of the northwest wind there for\r\nmiles. The house was set as it were on a pinnacle. I think the\r\nprotection from the northwest is fully as essential in such a position\r\nas any other.\r\n\r\nMr. Whiting: This windbreak proposition is a question of locality. In\r\nthe western part of the state, as well as in South Dakota--especially in\r\nSouth Dakota--we say that the south windbreak is decidedly the most\r\nimportant of any we can put in. We have more hot winds than you do here\r\nin the eastern part of Minnesota. You don't have that trouble, but in\r\nwestern Minnesota you are very much like we are in South Dakota. Mr.\r\nLudlow knows the conditions, and I say you must take that into\r\nconsideration. If you are in that locality the south windbreak is\r\ndecidedly the most important of any. Then I would say the windbreak on\r\nthe south, west and north are all of considerable importance. Of course,\r\nyou can overdo it, you can smother your orchard. You must guard against\r\nthat, but we have too much air drainage.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the variety proposition, isn't it true that you are growing\r\ntoo many perishable apples in Minnesota? I know it is so in South\r\nDakota. We are growing too many of these early varieties; we ought to\r\ngrow more winter varieties. If you want to build up a large commercial\r\napple business you have got to raise more keepers. You are planting too\r\nmany early varieties.\r\n\r\nMr. Dowds: I have been setting out apple trees more or less in different\r\nstates for sixty years. If I was going to set out another orchard I\r\nwould put windbreaks all around it, north, south, east and west, and\r\nthe windbreak that I would use would be the yellow willow. It grows\r\nquick, it gives you a circulation of air, and it protects your trees. My\r\nexperience in the last fifteen years has been that the yellow willow was\r\nthe best windbreak that you can have around the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Mr. Whiting says, grow winter apples.

W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H. H. Whetzel, of the plant disease survey, U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, stationed at Cornell University, where the American Peony\r\nSociety has its test grounds, has made a study of the stem-rot disease\r\nof the peony and has set forth the results in an address before the\r\nMassachusetts Horticultural Society, from which the following has been\r\nculled:\r\n\r\n\"The botrytis blight is by far the most common and destructive disease\r\nof the peony so far as known at present. This disease is frequently\r\nepidemic, especially during wet springs. It occurs wherever peonies are\r\ngrown, apparently the world over.\r\n\r\n\"This disease usually makes its appearance early in the spring when the\r\nstalks are coming up. Shoots will suddenly wilt and fall. Examination\r\nwill show they have rotted at the base or just below the surface of the\r\nground. The rotted portion will soon become covered with a brown coat of\r\nspores--much like felt. Generally it is the young stalks that are\r\naffected, though sometimes stalks with buds just opening will suddenly\r\nwilt and fall. It is thought the spores are carried through the winter\r\non the old stubble, after the tops have been cut off. They are in the\r\nbest position to give rise to a new crop of spores in the spring, and\r\nthe new shoots become infected as they appear.\r\n\r\n\"To eradicate this disease the old stubble should be carefully removed\r\nin the fall or early spring by removing first the soil from the crown so\r\nas not to injure the buds, and cutting off the old stalks. These should\r\nbe burned and the soil replaced with clean soil or preferably sand.\r\nWhenever a shoot shows sign of the disease it should be cut off and\r\nburned. The buds must also be watched and any that begin to turn brown\r\nor black and die must also be cut off and burned, as spores will be\r\nfound upon them, and these will be spread by the wind and insects.\r\nSpotted leaves should also be picked off. In wet seasons the peonies\r\nshould be closely watched. For the small garden, with comparatively few\r\nclumps of peonies, this treatment will be entirely practical and\r\neffective.\"\r\n\r\nBulbs should be ordered this month if you wish the pick of the new crop.\r\nThere are two fall blooming bulbs that would add to our September and\r\nOctober gardens. One is the Sternbergia, or autumn daffodil, and the\r\nother is the autumn crocus.\r\n\r\nThe bulbs should be planted in August and will blossom the same season.\r\nThe daffodil is a clear yellow and is good for cutting. These bulbs must\r\nbe ordered as early as possible.\r\n\r\nLady bugs are our garden friends, destroying multitudes of aphides. They\r\nshould never be killed.\r\n\r\nHave you the following all ready for use?\r\n\r\nFor insects, bugs or worms that chew--or eat portions of\r\nplants--arsenate of lead, paris green or hellebore.\r\n\r\nFor sucking insects, nicotine or kerosene emulsion.\r\n\r\nFor diseases, bordeaux mixture or ammoniacal copper carbonate solution.\r\n\r\nA good sprayer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Remember_ our photographic contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nINCREASING COLONIES (CONTINUED FROM JUNE NO.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. Francis Jager's apiary at St. Bonifacius.]\r\n\r\nTo increase you must first make your colonies strong. One or more of\r\nyour best colonies must be selected to raise queens for your increase\r\nunless you wish to buy your queen. Stimulate your queen raising colonies\r\nby feeding and not giving them any supers. The crowded condition will\r\nbring on an early swarming impulse, under which they will raise from\r\ntwelve to twenty large, well developed queen cells each. The queens of\r\nyour queen raising colonies should be clipped. When in due time a queen\r\nraising colony swarms, catch the queen and remove her and let the swarm\r\nreturn. Immediately after this swarm you may proceed to divide your\r\nother colonies from which you wish to increase. Put down on a permanent\r\nlocation as many empty hives as you have available queen cells in your\r\ncolony that swarmed. Into one of these you put your removed breeding\r\nqueen with two frames of brood and bees. Into each of the rest of the\r\nempty hives put two frames of brood with all adhering bees from your\r\ncolonies you wish to increase. Be sure to leave the queens in the old\r\nhive after brood for increase with adhering bees has been removed. Thus\r\nyou have now a number of new colonies with bees and two frames of brood\r\nbut no queen. The rest of the hive may be filled with drawn comb or\r\nsheets of foundation. To prevent the bees from returning to the old\r\nhome, stuff the entrance of the hive solidly with grass. In two days the\r\ngrass will wilt and dry and the bees will come out automatically and\r\nstay in the new location--at least most of them. In the meantime being\r\nqueenless they will be busy with raising queen cells on the two frames\r\nof brood. This occupation will make them contented, then on the seventh\r\nday cut out every one of their queen cells and give them a cell from\r\nyour breeder colony. Your queen breeding colony on the seventh day after\r\nswarming will have ripe queen cells ready to hatch, with one queen\r\nprobably out. If by listening in the evening you hear her \"sing\" and\r\n\"peep\" go next morning and remove all queen cells and give one to each\r\nof your newly formed colonies. They will be readily accepted, will hatch\r\nimmediately, sometimes whilst you are removing them, but certainly the\r\nsame or next day and begin laying in due time. From such colonies you\r\nmay not expect any surplus honey, but they will build up rapidly and\r\nwill be strong colonies to put away next fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMINISTRATION BUILDING (MAIN BUILDING), UNIVERSITY\r\nFARM, ST.

F. WOODS, DEAN AND DIRECTOR, DEPT. OF AGRI., UNIVERSITY OF MINN., ST.\r\nPAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farm without its windbreaks, shade trees, fruits, flowers and\r\ngarden, if it can be called a home at all is certainly one that needs\r\ndeveloping and improving. There are many abiding places in the\r\nNorthwest, as in every other part of the United States, that lack some\r\nessential part of them. The first and most important step with a view to\r\ncorrecting these conditions is to bring together those interested in\r\nhome improvement to talk over problems and difficulties and to plan how\r\nto correct them and to interest others in the movement. This is what\r\nthis great society with its auxiliary societies has been and is now\r\ndoing most successfully. It is true that your work has been more\r\nparticularly from the horticultural view point, but, as I said in the\r\nbeginning, fruits and flowers are civilizing and home making influences.\r\n\r\nThere should be more horticulturally interested people from the farms\r\naffiliated with this society. Each farmers' club should have a\r\nhorticultural committee. There are now about nine hundred farmers' clubs\r\nin the state, and the number is increasing constantly. These clubs\r\nrepresent the communities in which the members live. They include men,\r\nwomen and children, farmers, preachers, teachers, every member of the\r\ncommunity willing to cooperate. They start things in the community\r\ninterest and follow them up. The Agricultural Extension Service of the\r\nUniversity is in close touch with these clubs. The horticulturists of\r\nthe service especially might help to arouse the interest of the clubs in\r\nthis movement. This society might offer some prizes especially designed\r\nto interest the boys and girls of the farmers' clubs. Each club\r\nhorticultural committee should have representation in this society. Some\r\nof the prizes might be memberships or trips to the annual meeting. Many\r\nmembers of this society are members of such clubs. They could take the\r\nlead in the movement. In this way the society would keep in touch with\r\nthe homes and communities of the state, and all would grow together in\r\nhorticultural grace--and the other graces that go with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Minnesota farm home with handsome grounds and modern\r\nconveniences.]\r\n\r\nThe gospel of better homes is like every other gospel. It must be taken\r\nto those who need it and who know it not or are not interested. The\r\nextension service of the University is organized to carry the message of\r\nbetter homes, better farms, better social and business relations to the\r\npeople who need it. Farmers' institutes, short courses, lectures,\r\ndemonstration, farm supervision, judging at county fairs, boys' and\r\ngirls' club work, institute trains, county agent service, indicate some\r\nof the kinds of work in progress. The press is also a powerful factor in\r\nthis work. The Minnesota Farmers' Library, which is made up of timely\r\npublications on all matters of rural interest, has a mailing list of\r\nfifty-five thousand farmers. From six to twelve of these publications\r\nare issued each year. \"University Farm Press News\" reaches regularly\r\nsix hundred papers in the state. \"Rural School Agriculture,\" containing\r\nmaterial especially adapted to the needs of the consolidated and rural\r\nschools, reaches practically every rural and consolidated school in the\r\nstate each month. \"The Visitor\" is a special publication prepared for\r\nthe use of the teachers of agriculture in the high schools of the state.\r\nThe \"Farmers' Institute Annual\" is a manual of three hundred pages\r\npublished each year in editions of fifty thousand and contains material\r\nof interest to every farmer. Many special articles are prepared for farm\r\npapers. Every department of the extension service and college and\r\nstation is in touch with the farm homes of the state through\r\ncorrespondence, and much valuable work is accomplished in this way. The\r\naim is always to work from the home as the center, and from that to the\r\ngroup of homes constituting the community, the township, the county and\r\nthe state, in an ever-enlarging circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical Minnesota consolidated school building.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest opportunity for better homes and better farms and a better\r\ncountry life is in enlisting the children of the country in the\r\nmovement. When I say the children of the country, I do not mean to\r\nexclude the children of the villages and towns whose tastes may lead\r\nthem countryward. We should never stop or attempt to stop the free\r\nmovement between the country and the city. It is good for both. The\r\nchildren of today will be the farmers and farm home makers and the\r\nbusiness men and women of tomorrow. Are the children of the farmers\r\nlooking forward with interest to farming as a business, and life in the\r\ncountry as attractive? The movement to the city in ever-increasing\r\nnumbers is the answer, but it is the answer to what has been and now is,\r\nrather than to what is to be. A new day is dawning, in which the\r\nbrightest minds and the choicest spirits will again choose to live in\r\nthe open country and make there the ideal homes from which shall\r\ncontinue to come the life and vigor of the nation. But if it is to be\r\nso, the schools of the country must furnish real intelligent leadership\r\nand the country church must come again to spiritual leadership. We must\r\nall help to bring this about.\r\n\r\nMinnesota has a plan to accomplish this, and it is working out even\r\nbetter than we dared hope. Experience has shown that by consolidation or\r\nthe cooperation of several districts, good results may be secured at no\r\ngreater cost than the same type of school costs in town. The small\r\nschool of today is expensive because it is inefficient. The consolidated\r\nschool is giving the children of the country the education that they\r\nneed and is doing it better than it can be done anywhere else. The\r\nconsolidated school is becoming the rural community center. An important\r\nfeature which has been adopted by many of the consolidated districts is\r\nthe building of a home for the teachers in connection with the school.\r\nThis home may be made typical of what the modern home should be, not\r\nexpensive but substantial, artistic, convenient and sanitary. The\r\ngrounds should be suitably planted with trees, shrubs and flowers, and\r\nthere should be a garden. The school building is also made to fit the\r\nneeds of the community. The larger rooms may be used for entertainments,\r\nfarmers' club meetings, lectures, etc. There should be facilities for\r\ntesting milk and other agricultural products, examining soils, etc.\r\nThere should be a shop for wood and iron work, or at least a work bench\r\nand an anvil. There should be a library of good reading and a place to\r\ncook and bake and sew. There should be a typewriter, a piano or an\r\norgan, and such other conveniences for teaching and social center work\r\nas the community may wish and be able to secure, and, best of all,\r\nteachers living at the school who know how to operate the plant in\r\nevery detail and to make it useful to the community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An ideal plan for consolidated school grounds.]\r\n\r\nThere were nine of these schools five years ago in Minnesota. According\r\nto the last report of the Department of Public Instruction, there are\r\n142 now, and the number is increasing constantly. The state as a state\r\nis behind the movement and is giving substantial aid, direction and\r\nsupervision to these schools. When the forward movement was planned,\r\nplans were also made to train teachers and to give the teachers already\r\nin the service special work that would fit them to adjust themselves to\r\nthe new needs.\r\n\r\nThe normal schools and the high schools teaching agriculture, manual\r\ntraining and home economics have adjusted their courses to meet this new\r\ndemand. Six years ago the work had hardly begun. Today there are 214\r\nhigh and graded schools teaching home economics, 177 teaching\r\nagriculture, 125 teaching manual training, and of these 121 are\r\npreparing teachers especially for the rural schools.\r\n\r\nThe College of Agriculture and Home Economics of the University of\r\nMinnesota is training the teachers in these subjects for the high\r\nschools and normal schools, and, in cooperation with the State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, the Department of Agriculture has\r\nbeen conducting a summer school for rural teachers, where those already\r\nteaching and those planning to teach can get the training required to\r\nmeet the new conditions and demands. Similar summer schools have been\r\nconducted in cooperation with the agricultural schools at Crookston and\r\nMorris. All together each year there are between 1,800 and 2,000\r\nteachers taking these special courses. Every effort is made to bring to\r\nthese teachers the view point of the new country life movement.\r\n\r\nThis society and the members individually in their home communities\r\nshould stand squarely behind this movement. They should become\r\nthoroughly informed regarding it. It is the cornerstone of the new\r\ncountry life.\r\n\r\nFinally I wish to call your attention again to the great educational\r\nopportunity which you are missing. If you could come into vital contact\r\neach year with more than 4,000 young men and women who are seeking for\r\neverything that will help them to be more useful citizens, would you do\r\nit? You could exert in that way an exceedingly great influence on the\r\nhomes and future welfare of this state and nation. You can do it if you\r\nwill come out and live with us the year round at University Farm. We\r\nshould have a building there suited to your needs that we could all use\r\nas a great horticultural center, open the year round. You have already\r\ntaken steps in this direction. I hope that conditions will be such that\r\nwe can join hands to get it very soon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAN JOSE SCALE REQUIRES PROMPT ACTION--ORCHARD SHOULD EITHER BE\r\nDESTROYED OR SPRAYED BEFORE BUDS OPEN.--There are a few orchards in\r\nColorado that are found to be infested with the San Jose scale.\r\n\r\nOwners of these orchards should determine upon one of two courses to\r\npursue. The orchard should either be promptly cut down and destroyed, or\r\nthe trees should be thoroughly treated with lime-sulphur solution or a\r\ngood quality of miscible oil for the destruction of the scale before the\r\nbuds open in the spring.\r\n\r\nIf lime-sulphur is determined upon, the home-made article may be used,\r\nor the commercial lime-sulphur solutions may be used, in which case they\r\nshould be diluted with water, in the proportion of one gallon of the\r\ncommercial lime-sulphur to not more than ten gallons of water. The\r\napplication should be made thoroughly, so that every bit of the bark of\r\ntrunk and limbs is covered with the spray.\r\n\r\nIf miscible oil is used, I would recommend using one gallon of the oil\r\nto each nineteen gallons of water. Hard or alkaline waters should be\r\navoided, as sometimes the oil will not make a good emulsion with them.\r\nUse soft water, if possible.--C.P. Gillette, Colorado Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horticulturist as King.\r\n\r\nC. S. HARRISON, NURSERYMAN, YORK, NEB.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the promises regarding our future stagger us with their\r\nvastness. \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my\r\nthrone.\" But how is it down here? Thou \"crownest him with riches and\r\nhonor.\" Thou hast \"put all things under his feet.\" Unto fields where\r\nfeet of angels come not we are chosen as partners of the Heavenly Father\r\nto make this a more fruitful and beautiful world.\r\n\r\nIn our life work much depends on our attitude regarding our calling. We\r\ncan plod like an ox, or like Markham's semi-brute man with the hoe, and\r\nmake that the badge of servitude to toil, or we can make it a wand in a\r\nmagician's hand to call forth radiant forms of beauty from the somber\r\nearth to smile upon us and load the air with fragrance. We can live down\r\nin the basement of horticulture or in the upper story.\r\n\r\nMan is coming to his own. The savage trembled at the lightning stroke\r\nwhich shivered the mighty oak. Little knew he that here was a giant at\r\nplay waiting to be tamed and harnessed so he could be the most obedient\r\nservant--ready at the master's beck to leap a continent, dive under the\r\nocean, draw heavy trains, and run acres of machinery. Man reaches out\r\nhis wand, and steam, gas, and oil rise up to do his will.\r\n\r\nIf, with the advance of civilization, he wants beautiful things to adorn\r\nperson or home, he finds subterranean gardens of precious gems almost\r\npriceless in value--gems that are immortals, flowers that never fade,\r\nprophets all of the \"glory to be revealed.\"\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the marvelous Persian garden of gems--four hundred\r\nfeet in length and ninety feet wide--made to imitate the most beautiful\r\nblooms of earth. It cost millions upon millions. Do you know that it is\r\nin your power, with the advance of floriculture, to create gardens far\r\nmore resplendent in beauty--great gardens of delight fit for the touch\r\nof angel's feet, while the whole is flooded with billows of sweetest\r\nperfume? Three years ago that was a patch of barren earth; now you have\r\npulled down a section of paradise upon it and condensed there the tints\r\nof the morning, the splendors of the evening, the beauty of the rainbow,\r\nand the effulgence which flames in the mantles of the suns.\r\n\r\nI love to think of Nature as a person--first born daughter of God--her\r\nhead white with the snows of the centuries, her cheeks radiant with the\r\nflush of recurrent springtime, emblems of eternal youth. She takes you\r\nby the hand, leads you into the forests, talks to you of the soul of the\r\ntree, tells you how intelligent it is. There is one standing in the\r\nopen. It has performed a feat no civil engineer can emulate. Think of\r\nthose roots so busily scurrying around in the earth, gathering food to\r\nsend up the cambium highway to nourish the trees. See the taut cords\r\nthrown out to anchor it against the storms. Look at those trees on the\r\noutskirts. Among wild animals the strongest are on guard on the outside\r\nto protect the herd. So these sentinel trees guard their wards against\r\nthe storms. Fool man cuts down the guards and the wards fall before the\r\nsweep of the storm. Mother Nature--dear, friendly soul--takes you into\r\nher holy of holies and reveals her mysteries. She makes a confident of\r\nyou. She throws open her doors and shows you the wide vistas of a new\r\nland you may enter and glorify. Follow her direction, and what a friend\r\nyou have! Cross her, thinking you know more than she does, and she\r\nlaughs at you. She takes you into the garden and the nursery and\r\ndiscloses her wonders and helps you to work miracles. You plant seeds\r\nand bulbs, and beauty rises to greet you. Did you ever think of the\r\nroyal position of the florist and horticulturist?\r\n\r\nThe sacred poet speaks of the \"labor of the olive.\" What a flood of\r\nlight that opens upon us. \"All things are yours.\" Let us go out into the\r\ngrove you have planted. I once took off my hat to myself. While living\r\nin the Republican Valley, near the 100th meridian, I planted some bull\r\npine seed. When the little trees were large enough, I transplanted them\r\nin rows six feet apart and started a miniature forest. Twenty-five years\r\nafter I went to see them. The rows were straight. The trees had fine\r\nbodies six inches through. They were miniature columns in a temple,\r\nholding up a canopy of green. The ground was covered with a thick carpet\r\nof needles. It was one of the most pleasing sights I ever saw. Then I\r\nthought, \"What if I had planted forty acres?\" I would have had a Mecca\r\nto which horticultural pilgrims would have flocked from hundreds of\r\nmiles. I planted the trees, and the faithful servants kept on working\r\nday and night, and that beautiful grove was the result. Every tree you\r\nplant is your servant, and how faithful it is--no shirking, always at it\r\nwhether you are looking or not. Look at that cherry tree. How the tiny\r\nrootlets scurry through the soil--faithful children gathering food to\r\nsend up to their mother. Look at that flood of bloom. Then the fruit\r\ngrows till a mass of red gleams from the leafy coverts. There is a great\r\ndifference between a patch of brown earth and your faithful Jonathan.\r\nWhat a marvel that little patch of soil, absolutely milked by those busy\r\nforagers, and the extracts of it glowing in red beauty on the tree. Talk\r\nof chemists! Those quiet rootlets surpass them all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Albert Victor iris, from Mr. Harrison's garden--about\r\none-third size.]\r\n\r\nIf you want to be in the realm of miracles, lay down your hoe awhile and\r\nsit among your flowers. Your brain devised the plan, your hand planted\r\nthe seeds and bulbs. \"Behold the lilies, how they grow.\" Now sit there\r\nand think it out. At your feet are artists no human skill may imitate.\r\nTwo peonies grow side by side. Golden Harvest opens with yellow petals\r\nfading to purest white. In the center is a miniature Festiva\r\nMaxima--blood drops and all. How can those roots send up the golden\r\ntints, the snowy white and the red, and never have the colors mixed?\r\nClose by is a Plutarch, deep brilliant red. The roots intermingle. How\r\nis it possible to pick out of the dull soil, Nature's eternal drab, that\r\nbrilliant color for your peony? There are your iris, the new sorts\r\nabsolutely undescribable. There are a dozen different shades in a single\r\nbloom. But those blind artists at work in their subterranean studios\r\nnever make a mistake. The standards must have just such colors, the\r\nfalls just such tints, and where did they get that dazzling radiant\r\nreflex such as you see on Perfection, Monsignor and Black Knight? But it\r\nis always there shimmering in the sunlight. There is a fairy--a pure\r\nsnowy queen. How was that sweetness and purity ever extracted from the\r\nscentless soil? Every bloom uncorks a vial of perfume which has the odor\r\nof the peach blossom.\r\n\r\nDid you ever sit down in your kingdom and see what a royal throne you\r\noccupied? What a reception your flowers give you! The ambrosia and\r\nnectar of the feasts of the deities of fable are overshadowed by the\r\nfragrance and sweetness of your worshippers. It would seem that every\r\nflower, like a royal subject, was bent on rendering the most exalted\r\nhonor to her king. No company of maidens preparing for nuptials were\r\never arrayed like these. Each one is striving to do her best. The\r\nhighest art ever displayed in the palaces of kings is no comparison to\r\nthe beauty and splendor of your reception. By divine right you are\r\nsupreme. The fertile soil puts her tributes at your feet; for you all\r\nthe viewless influences of nature are at work; for you the sun shines\r\nand the showers fall. So brothers, don't creep but mount up as on\r\neagle's wings. Invoice yourself and see how great you are! Don't live\r\nall the while in the basement--spend some time in the upper story of\r\nyour calling!\r\n\r\nYou are not making the earth weep blood. You are not spreading on the\r\nfields a carpet of mangled forms. You are not dropping ruin and death\r\nfrom the skies or polluting God's pure waters with submarines. You are\r\nnot turning all your energies into the work of destruction, despoiling\r\nthe treasures of art and the pride of the ages and turning the fairest\r\nportions of the earth into desolations. You are not changing yourselves\r\ninto demons to gloat over starvation and ruin. You are soldiers of\r\npeace. Behind you was the somber earth. You touched it with the wand of\r\nyour power, and beauty, health and pleasure sprang up to bless you.\r\n\r\nSee what you have done! You have clothed the barrenness of the dreary\r\nplain with gardens, orchards and forests. You have been at work with God\r\nand glorified a vast empire, and now he has blessed the work of your\r\nhands. Instead of the air sodden with tears and tremulous with the wail\r\nof widows and orphans, you are welcomed with the joy of children and the\r\ndelight of mothers. All along the lines of progress you receive the most\r\ncordial ovations, and when you pass on to the land where \"everlasting\r\nspring abides\", may you receive the royal welcome, \"Well done, good and\r\nfaithful servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newer Fruits in 1915 and How Secured.\r\n\r\nPROF. N. E.

These conditions, of course, are unusual, but it prevented the\r\nfruiting of a lot of new fruit seedlings which appeared promising.\r\nHowever, I decided to propagate two new plums because they had borne\r\nseveral excellent crops. One of these is a very late plum of good\r\nquality, with flesh of peculiar crisp texture, which ripens after all\r\nthe other plums, about a week before frost. It is a combination of the\r\nWolf plum with the Kansas sand plum (_Prunus Watsoni_). The tree is of\r\nlate dwarf habit but very productive, and its late season may give it a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAnother plum which I decided to place in propagation is a hybrid of the\r\nwild plum of Manitoba with the Japanese plum. The mother tree was raised\r\nfrom wild plum pits received from Manitoba a few years ago. These bear\r\nvery freely and are the earliest of the native plums. The tree is of\r\nlow, dwarf habit. The fruit is not as large as my Waneta, which is a\r\nhybrid of the largest native plum, the Terry, (_Prunus Americana_), with\r\nthe Apple, one of the best of Burbank's Japanese plums. But since the\r\nrange of the plum Manitoba is so far north, it may give greater\r\nhardiness where that is needed. At any rate, it is of interest to know\r\nthat the Manitoba native plum can be mated with the Japanese plum.\r\n\r\nPears constitute my favorite line at present. \"What can I do for hardy\r\npears?\" is a question I have been asked many times. The prairie\r\nnorthwest cannot raise pears owing to the cold or the blight. In my\r\ntravels in Asia, including four tours of exploration in Siberia, I made\r\na business of buying up basketfuls of pears in Manchuria, Mongolia,\r\nWestern China and Eastern Siberia and saving the seed, giving the flesh\r\naway to the coolies, who were glad always to get the fruit. These have\r\nraised me many seedlings. In addition I have imported a lot of pears\r\nfrom Russia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pyrus Simoni\r\n\r\nThe hardy, blight-proof sand pear used by Prof. N.E. Hansen in breeding\r\npears for the Northwest. A careful study of our eastern Arctic pears has\r\nbeen made recently by Mr. Alfred Rehder, botanist at Arnold Arboretum,\r\nand this form of sand pear is now called Pyrus Ovoidea instead of Pyrus\r\nSinensis, or Pyrus Simoni.]\r\n\r\nThe pears of northern China and eastern Siberia are usually called the\r\nChinese sand pear and have been given various names, _Pyrus Sinensis_,\r\n_Pyrus Ussuriensis_, _Pyrus Simoni_. The form I am working with mainly\r\nwas received in the spring of 1899 at the South Dakota Station under the\r\nname of _Pyrus Simoni_, from Dr. C.S. Sargent, Director of the Arnold\r\nArboretum, Boston, Massachusetts. Since the publication of Bulletin 159,\r\nof the South Dakota Experiment Station, April, 1915, in which I give a\r\nbrief outline of this work, the pears of this region have been studied\r\nby Dr. Alfred Rehder of the Arnold Arboretum, and it now appears that\r\nthe true name of _Pyrus Simonii_ should be _Pyrus Ovoidea_. These trees\r\nhave proved perfectly hardy at Brookings and have never suffered from\r\nblight. Varieties of other pears have been top-grafted on this tree, and\r\nthey have blighted, but the blight did not affect the rest of the tree.\r\nMr. Charles G. Patten, Charles City, Iowa, also has a form of the\r\nChinese sand pear which has proven immune to blight. In other places\r\nsand pears have been under trial which have suffered from\r\nwinter-killing. However, I understand that the pear Mr. Patten has\r\ntapers toward the stem, while the pear received by me as _Pyrus Simonii_\r\ntapers toward the blossom end. The actual source of seed is really of\r\ngreater importance than the botanical name, as it is possible to get the\r\nseed from too far south, whereas we should plant only the northern form\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Pyrus Ovoidea_ correspond in size to the ordinary pear\r\nmuch like the Whitney crab-apple does to the apple. It is a real pear,\r\njuicy and sweet, but not high flavored. Other varieties of pears have\r\nbeen top-grafted on this tree and have blighted, but the blight did not\r\naffect the rest of the tree. During the many seasons I have had this\r\npear the tip of one twig only showed a very slight trace the past\r\nseason, but I did not determine it was really blight. It is practically\r\nimmune.\r\n\r\nI have also worked the Birch-Leaved pear, _Pyrus betulifolia_, Bunge, a\r\nnative of northern China, and a choice ornamental tree. Trees of this\r\nspecies were received from a nursery in Germany in the fall of 1896 and\r\nhave proven perfectly hardy and quite resistant to blight. The fruit is\r\nquite small, usually less than one-half inch in diameter, covered with\r\nthick russet. _Betulifolia_ means birch-leaved, alluding to the shape of\r\nthe leaf.\r\n\r\nNow, the pear is a difficult thing to work with on account of blight.\r\nWhat is blight? It is an American bacterial disease, not found in the\r\nhome of the pear, Asia or Europe, so that during the 6,000 years of its\r\ncultivation of recorded history the pear has never had to meet the\r\nbacterial enemy known as blight. That is one of the reasons, I presume,\r\nwhy they have such strict quarantine in Europe against American trees.\r\nThe question with pears is, will they stand blight or not? They are\r\nspending hundreds of thousands of dollars in California to keep out\r\nblight. Blight is a native of the northeast United States, and they are\r\nkeeping it down on the Pacific slope, but they are always on the edge of\r\nthe precipice. The whole pear culture of America is in an unsatisfactory\r\nstate, owing to this danger.\r\n\r\nWith these two northern pears as a foundation, I have endeavored to\r\nsecure seedlings with fruit of large size and choice quality by\r\nhybridizing them with many of the best cultivated pears from Germany,\r\nFrance, England, Central Russia and Finland, as well as with some of the\r\nbest varieties from the eastern pear-growing regions of the United\r\nStates. The work has been done mostly under glass in our fruit-breeding\r\ngreenhouse. Some of these fruits weighed one and one-fourth pounds. Some\r\nof the resulting seedlings are subject to blight, while many have thus\r\nfar shown immunity. Since it is impossible to determine their relative\r\nimmunity to blight except by distributing them for trial elsewhere, I\r\nsent out scions in the spring of 1915 of thirty-nine of these new\r\nseedlings to twenty-four men in several states. These varieties are\r\nunder restrictions until fruited and deemed worthy of further\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crossing work in pears--view in Prof. N. E. Hansen's\r\nFruit-Breeding Greenhouse, State College, Brookings, S.D.]\r\n\r\nI did not know whether immunity to blight is a possibility or only an\r\niridescent dream, so I made no charge for these scions. The only test of\r\na pear seedling, the same as with the apple, is that of propagation.\r\nFurthermore, if you have but the one seedling tree you may lose it by\r\naccident; whereas, if you send it out to a number of good men, you\r\ncannot lose it.\r\n\r\nIt should be distinctly understood that none of these new seedlings have\r\nborne fruit, but by what may be termed the projective efficiency of the\r\npedigree I am satisfied that some of them will be valuable. In like\r\nmanner, a horse-breeder depends so much on the pedigree in his colts\r\nthat he is willing to enter them in a race. I believe something of value\r\nwill come from this line of work. I do know that my _Pyrus Ovoidea_ is a\r\npretty good, juicy little pear, a whole lot better than no pear at all.\r\nI hope these seedlings will keep up their immunity to blight. The\r\noriginal seedling trees certainly have had every chance to become\r\naffected by blight, as they were surrounded by blighting apple trees,\r\ncrab-apple trees and pear trees, and no blight was cut out. I thought\r\nthis was the best way, since that is the test they will have in the\r\nfarmers' orchards when they go out from the nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hardy Pear Stocks._--Now we are up against the problem of stocks for\r\nthese hardy pears. The quince is a standard dwarf stock, but it is not\r\nhardy enough for us. Last spring I planted 12,000 seedlings of the\r\nvarious commercial pear stocks, including imported French pear\r\nseedlings, American grown French pear seedlings, Kieffer pear seedlings\r\nand Japan pear seedlings. From one season's experience I like the Japan\r\npear the best. The French pear seedlings, especially, did not do well.\r\nThe Japan pear stock is coming into high favor in recent years on our\r\nPacific slope, where it is sometimes called the Chinese blight-proof\r\nstock. The French pear stock is not in favor on our Pacific slope owing\r\nto their liability to blight. We may also expect from the French pear\r\nstock a decided lack of hardiness. The Japan pear stock is probably some\r\nform of the Chinese sand pear. The seed may come from too far south,\r\nwhereas we should plant only the northern form of the species. This\r\nvarying degree of hardiness in the Japan pear seedling of commerce I\r\nfind discussed in a German horticultural paper. I have tried to\r\nestablish a regular source of supply by importing the seed, but it is\r\ndifficult indeed to do this. To avoid root-killing at the north we\r\nshould mulch these Japan pear seedlings heavily until we get enough\r\norchards of this truly hardy form, _Pyrus Ovoidea_, planted so we can\r\nraise our own stocks. I firmly believe we will extend pear culture on\r\nthe North American continent clear to the Arctic Circle if we wish.\r\n\r\nFor pear stocks I am going to try everything I can think of. Some years\r\nago I worked pears on Juneberry stock from a hint given me many years\r\nago by Professor J.L. Budd. These grew well and were in full bloom when\r\nfive feet high, but were lost in clearing off a block of trees. I hope\r\nto try this again on a larger scale. The mountain ash and hawthorn are\r\nsometimes used, but both will be expensive and perhaps short-lived. The\r\nquince is the dwarf stock of commerce but would need to be very heavily\r\nmulched to prevent root-killing. Such dwarf pears are splendid in the\r\nback yard, or for training up against the side of the house; the fruit\r\nis fine and large, and the trees fruit the second year. The pear will\r\nroot in nursery by grafting with a long scion on apple seedlings. I hope\r\nthere will be much work done along this line.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the question, I think there is a hardy pear in sight. We have\r\nthe requisite pedigree back of it, and it seems that the quality we call\r\nimmunity to blight is in some of these Chinese or Siberian pears. If we\r\ncan combine the hardiness and blight-resistance of this Siberian pear\r\nwith the large size and high quality of fruit of the European pear, with\r\nthousands of years of cultivation back of it, then we have the solution\r\nof the pear question in sight. Millions and millions of people are\r\nwatching for a good hardy pear.

It seems\r\nthat occasionally sporadic forms appear in mushroom beds, persist for a\r\nday or two, and then disappear. These are generally manure-inhabiting\r\nspecies and may be observed shortly after the beds have been cased. In\r\nthe instance cited, however, these fungi appeared in considerable\r\nnumbers at the time the edible _Agaricus campestris_ should have been\r\nready for the market, and the dealer supposed it was probably a new\r\nbrown variety and tried it in his own family. As a result, five persons\r\nwere rendered absolutely helpless and were saved after several hours\r\nonly through the assistance of a second physician who had had experience\r\nwith this type of poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the Department, this case is peculiarly significant\r\nand demonstrates that the grower must be able to distinguish _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ from any of the wild forms of mushrooms that may appear in\r\nthe beds. Under the circumstances, the Department strongly urges every\r\ngrower to make himself thoroughly familiar with the cultivated species.\r\nComplete descriptions, with pictures of poisonous and cultivated\r\nspecies, are contained in Department Bulletin 175, \"Mushrooms and Other\r\nCommon Fungi,\" which can be purchased for 30 cents from the\r\nSuperintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington,\r\nD.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManufacture of Cider Vinegar from Minnesota Apples.\r\n\r\nPROF. W. G. BRIERLY, HORT. DEPT., UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCider making is an old process, carried on in a small way on the farm or\r\nmore extensively in the commercial \"quick process.\" From apple cider\r\nmany different products are obtained, chief of these being vinegar and\r\nothers being bottled cider, boiled cider, apple butter and, more\r\nrecently, concentrated cider and cider syrup. This discussion will\r\nconsider only the manufacture of vinegar.\r\n\r\nAs a farm process, the making of cider vinegar utilizes an otherwise\r\nwaste product, the culls or unmarketable varieties. It can be done on\r\nrainy days or when other work is slack. For the best results, however,\r\nas in any form of marketing, some vinegar should be made each year so\r\nthat the market may be supplied regularly, and, further, to give the\r\nnecessary experience which will mean a better quality of vinegar.\r\n\r\nAs a commercial process we find the making of cider is a regularly\r\nconducted manufacturing enterprise in which a considerable amount of\r\ncapital is needed. Expert knowledge of vinegar making, especially of the\r\n\"quick process,\" is essential. On this basis it is not open to the apple\r\ngrower and is a doubtful venture on a co-operative plan without the help\r\nof experts. Where a vinegar factory is established, however, it gives to\r\nthe orchardist a means to dispose of his cull apples.\r\n\r\nConsidering the process as it can be carried on on the farm, there are a\r\nnumber of distinct steps, all of which are important. The first step is\r\nto prepare for the work. Get a good machine, as it will pay for itself\r\nin the added extract of juice. A good machine need not cost more than\r\n$25 and may be had for less. Casks must be obtained and sterilized with\r\nlive steam or sulphur fumes, washed thoroughly, and kept in a convenient\r\nplace where they will not dry. It is best as well to have the\r\nconvenience of running water to wash the apples if dirty and to clean up\r\nthe machine occasionally. Cleanliness should be provided for and\r\ninsisted upon, as dirty and decaying apples not only give undesirable\r\nflavors, but the bacteria and molds feed upon the sugar in the cider and\r\ngreatly reduce the strength of the vinegar. This is one reason why a\r\nrainy day is a good time for cider making, as dust and flies are less\r\nand molds are not so abundantly \"planted\" in the cider.\r\n\r\nThe next step is the grinding and pressing and is very simple. With an\r\nefficient machine the cider is quickly ready for the casks.\r\n\r\nThen follows the first fermentation, which very frequently is not\r\nproperly managed, and poor vinegar results. The casks should be filled\r\nonly two-thirds full, the bung left open but screened with cheesecloth\r\nor lightly fitted with a plug of cotton to admit air. Compressed yeast\r\ngenerally should be added, at the rate of one cake to each five gallons,\r\nfirst mixing the yeast in lukewarm water. If the cask is then placed in\r\na warm place, at least sixty degrees--seventy degrees or more being\r\nbetter--we have the three requirements of proper fermentation, namely,\r\nair, warmth and yeast. This will give rapid fermentation, which will\r\nreduce the loss of sugars to a minimum. This fermentation should be\r\nallowed to go on until completed. If vinegar starts to form it will\r\nusually leave a residue of sugar and give a weaker vinegar. It will\r\nrequire from two weeks to a year to change all the sugars into alcohol,\r\ndepending upon the management of the work. When finished the clear juice\r\nis \"racked\" or siphoned into a clean cask, through a straining cloth to\r\ninsure the removal of all pomace or sediment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. W. G. Brierly, Horticultural Dept., University Farm,\r\nSt. Paul, Minn.]\r\n\r\nThen follows the fermentation to produce the acetic acid and finish the\r\nvinegar. A \"starter\" of \"mother\" can be used, but it is best to take out\r\na gallon or more of the cider when \"racking\" and add a pint to a quart\r\nof a good grade cider vinegar. Let it stand in a warm place, well\r\ncovered with cheesecloth, and in from four to ten days a granular,\r\nbrownish cake should begin to form. This starter can then be put\r\ndirectly into the casks, a pint or more to each cask. If the starter\r\ndevelops a white, slimy coat, throw it out and start again. For all of\r\nthis second stage of fermentation follow the same plan as at first. Fill\r\nthe barrels not over two-thirds full, use a cotton plug or cheesecloth\r\nscreen at the bung and keep at a warm temperature. The essentials again\r\nare air and warmth, with a good vinegar starter. Under these conditions\r\nthe vinegar may be ready in from two to ten months. If the usual plan of\r\n\"natural\" fermentation is followed, and the cask is kept at a low\r\ntemperature, it may be three years before the vinegar is ready.\r\n\r\nWhen the vinegar seems to be completed, send a sample to the State Dairy\r\nand Food Commission at the Capitol for analysis. If they say it is\r\ncompleted, \"rack\" off and strain again into clean barrels, this time\r\nfilling full and driving in the bung. This will prevent loss from\r\nevaporation, and the vinegar can be sold at any time. The state law\r\nrequires that cider vinegars sold in the state measure up to a certain\r\nstandard--namely, four per cent. of acetic acid, 1.6 grams per 100 cc.\r\nof solids, and .25 grams per 100 cc. of ash.\r\n\r\nSo much for vinegar making in general. For Minnesota conditions little\r\nis known about the definite behavior of any apple varieties. This has\r\nled to the study of vinegar making as a problem for the Experiment\r\nStation. The Division of Horticulture is carrying on variety tests to\r\ndetermine the yields of juice at different stages of maturity, the\r\nefficiency of types of presses, labor costs per gallon, and the\r\nproduction of vinegar from each variety to determine its value. The\r\nDivision of Agricultural Chemistry makes analyses of the sweet cider to\r\ndetermine the composition and vinegar prospects, and also analyzes the\r\nvinegars at various stages. The work has been carried on for two seasons\r\nand is showing some interesting facts. These must, however, be checked\r\nwith further work before definite statements can be published.\r\n\r\nAs to machines, our results show that the press with press cloths will\r\noutyield nearly two to one the press with the barrel or drum. However, a\r\nstrong grain sack used to catch the pomace and used to confine it in the\r\ndrum will give a very satisfactory yield, but it requires a considerable\r\namount of labor to do this.\r\n\r\nAs to labor costs per gallon, we have as yet no definite figures except\r\nthat one man can grind and press a minimum of eight to nine gallons an\r\nhour. Two men can raise the output to at least thirteen gallons. At 25\r\ncents per hour the cost per gallon on this basis varies between two and\r\nfour cents. As the apples are of little value, and the labor generally\r\n\"rainy day\" labor, this seems to give an inexpensive product.\r\n\r\nOur vinegars are as yet incomplete. The run of 1914 was very limited and\r\nof necessity stored in a cold cellar. It now tests two per cent. acetic\r\nacid, so is only half finished.\r\n\r\nAs to variety yields, the results of the work of two seasons compare\r\nvery closely and show generally that there is a variation from a minimum\r\nof a scant two gallons up to more than a pint over three gallons from\r\nforty pounds of each variety. The forty-pound quantity is taken as\r\nrepresentative of the bushel by measure. The varieties leading cider\r\nproduction are--the Hibernal and Wealthy, which generally have given us\r\nabout three gallons per forty pounds, the Duchess and Patten running\r\nslightly lower in cider yield. The Longfield, Lowland Raspberry,\r\nCharlamoff and Whitney rank in a third group, according to our trials.\r\nThis does not mean, however, that those in the latter group are not\r\nusable, as the Charlamoff and Whitney are among the highest in sugar\r\ncontent. These figures are greatly modified if the apples have been in\r\nstorage or are over-ripe.\r\n\r\nThe chemical analyses of the ciders show that, in general, Minnesota\r\napples do not contain relatively high percentages of sugars. This varies\r\nwith the season and increases with maturity. The highest total sugar\r\ncontent in ripe apples has been found in the Charlamoff at 9.25 per\r\ncent., followed in order by Whitney, 9.08 per cent., Wealthy 8.81 per\r\ncent., Duchess 8.60 per cent., Patten 8.21 per cent., Hibernal 7.85 per\r\ncent., and Longfield at 7.17 per cent. The significance of these figures\r\nis seen when the statement is made that it usually takes two per cent.\r\nsugars to make one per cent. of acetic acid. With the majority of our\r\napples we must work carefully, or the vinegar will not meet the state\r\nstandard of four per cent. acetic acid. This is further substantiated by\r\nthe report of the State Dairy and Food Commission that the vinegar\r\nsamples sent to them rarely come up to the standard.\r\n\r\nFrom the data as we now have it we cannot draw definite conclusions, but\r\nin general it is safe to say that the making of vinegar from Minnesota\r\napples is done on a close margin. This will mean careful work to get the\r\nmost out of the fermentation, the use of yeast, warm cellars or store\r\nrooms and proper management of the casks as to filling and the entrance\r\nof air. The work is not expensive. There is a good demand for really\r\ngood vinegar, and a market is provided for fruit which could not readily\r\nbe sold in any other form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Summer in Our Garden.\r\n\r\nMRS. GERTRUDE ELLIS SKINNER, AUSTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer in our garden begins with the arrival of the first seed catalogue\r\nin January, and closes the day before its arrival the next January. We\r\nmay be short on flowers in our garden, but we are long on seed\r\ncatalogues in our library. We do not believe in catalogue houses\r\nexcepting seed catalogues. We find them more marvelous than the Arabian\r\nNights, more imaginative than Baron Manchausen, and more alluring than a\r\ncircus poster. We care not who steals the Mona Lisa so long as Salzer\r\nsends us pictures of his cabbages. The art gallery of the Louvre may be\r\nrobbed of its masterpiece without awakening a pang in our breasts, if\r\nDreer will only send us the pictures of those roses that bloom in the\r\npaint-shops of Philadelphia. Morgan may purchase the choicest\r\ncollections of paintings in Europe and hide them from the public in his\r\nNew York mansion, if May will send us pictures of watermelons, such as\r\nwere never imagined by Raphael, Michael Angelo or Correggio.\r\n\r\nWhile the world watches the struggle for the ownership of some great\r\nrailway system, the control of some big trust, the development of some\r\nenormous enterprise, we watch for the arrival of the seed catalogue to\r\nsee which artist can get the most cabbages in a field, the most melons\r\non a cart, or make the corn look most like the big trees of Yosemite.\r\nDon't talk to us of the pleasures of bridge whist, it is not to be\r\ncompared with the seed catalogue habit.\r\n\r\nIn the seed catalogue we mark all the things we are going to buy, we\r\nmark all the new things. There is the wonderberry, sweeter than the\r\nblueberry, with the fragrance of the pineapple and the lusciousness of\r\nthe strawberry! We mark the Himalaya-berry--which grows thirty feet,\r\nsometimes sixty feet in a single season. Why, one catalogue told of a\r\nman who picked 3,833-1/2 pounds of berries from a single vine, beside\r\nwhat his children ate. Our Himalaya vine grew four inches the first\r\nseason and died the first winter. We were glad it did. We did not want\r\nsuch a monster running over our garden. We wanted to raise other things.\r\n\r\nBut we did not lose faith in our catalogues. We believe what they say\r\njust as the small boy believes he will see a lion eat a man at the\r\ncircus, because the billboard pictures him doing it.\r\n\r\nIf we ordered all the seeds we mark in the catalogue in January, we\r\nwould require a township for a garden, a Rockefeller to finance it and\r\nan army to hoe it. We did not understand the purpose of a catalogue for\r\na long time. A catalogue is a stimulus. It's like an oyster cocktail\r\nbefore a dinner, a Scotch high-ball before the banquet and the singing\r\nbefore the sermon. Salzer knows no one ever raised such a crop of\r\ncabbages as he pictures or the world would be drowned in sauer kraut. If\r\nthe Himalaya-berry bore as the catalogues say it does we should all be\r\nburied in jam. You horticulturists never expect to raise such an apple\r\nas Lindsay describes; if you did, they would be more valuable than the\r\ngolden apples of Hesperides.\r\n\r\nBut when we get a catalogue we just naturally dream that what we shall\r\nraise will not only be as good but will excel the pictures. Alas, of\r\nsuch stuff are dreams made! We could not do our gardening without\r\ncatalogues, but they are not true to life as we find it in our garden.\r\nWe never got a catalogue that showed the striped bug on the cucumber,\r\nthe slug on the rose bush, the louse on the aster, the cut worm on the\r\nphlox, the black bug on the syringa, the thousand and one pests,\r\nincluding the great American hen, the queen of the barnyard, but the\r\nGoth and vandal of the garden.\r\n\r\nBut the best part of summer in our garden is the work we do in winter.\r\nThen it is that our garden is most beautiful, for we work in the garden\r\nof imagination, where drouth does not blight, nor storms devastate,\r\nwhere the worm never cuts nor the bugs destroy. No dog ever uproots in\r\nthe garden of imagination, nor doth the hen scratch. This is the perfect\r\ngarden. Our golden glow blossoms in all of its auriferous splendor, the\r\nOriental poppy is a barbaric blaze of glory, our roses are as fair as\r\nthe tints of Aurora, the larkspur vies with the azure of heaven, the\r\ngladioli are like a galaxy of butterflies and our lilies like those\r\nwhich put Solomon in the shade. Every flower is in its proper place to\r\nmake harmony complete. There is not a jarring note of color in our\r\ngarden in the winter time.\r\n\r\nThen comes the spring in our garden, a time of faith, vigilance and hard\r\nwork. Faith that the seed will grow, vigilance that it is planted deep\r\nenough and has the right conditions in which to grow. Vigilance against\r\nfrost, weeds and insects. Planting, sowing, hoeing, transplanting,\r\ncoaxing, hoping, expecting, working--we never do half that we planned to\r\ndo in the springtime--there are not enough days, and the days we have\r\nare too short.\r\n\r\nThen comes summer, real summer in our garden. Then flowers begin to\r\nbloom, and our friends tell us they are lovely. But we see the flaws and\r\nerrors. We feel almost guilty to have our garden praised, so many\r\nglaring faults and shortcomings has it. The color scheme is wrong, there\r\nare false notes here and there. There are tall plants where short plants\r\nshould be. There are spaces and breaks and again spots over-crowded. We\r\nwater and hoe, train vines, prop plants, and kill the bugs, but we know\r\nthe weak spots in our garden and vow that next summer we shall remedy\r\nevery mistake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Gertrude Ellis Skinner among her gladoli.]\r\n\r\nThen \"summer in our garden\" has an autumn. The garden is never so\r\nbeautiful as when the first frost strikes it. Pillow-cases, sheets,\r\nshawls, aprons, coats and newspapers may for a brief time hold at bay\r\nthe frost king, but he soon laughs at our efforts, crawls under the\r\nedges of the unsightly garments with which we protect our flowers, nips\r\ntheir petals, wilts their stems and blackens their leaves. We find them\r\nsome morning hopelessly frozen. But the earth has ceased to give forth\r\nits aroma, the birds are winging southward, the waters of the brook run\r\nclear and cold, and the voice of the last cricket sounds lonesome in the\r\nland. We say to nature, \"Work your will with our garden; the summer is\r\nover, and we are ready to plan for another season.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what have we learned from the \"summer in our garden?\" That no one\r\ncan be happy in his garden unless he works for the joy of the working.\r\nHe who loves his work loves nature. To him his garden is a great\r\ncathedral, boundless as his wonder, a place of worship. Above him the\r\ndome ever changing in color and design, beautiful in sunshine or storm\r\nand thrice beautiful when studded with the eternal lamps of night. The\r\nwalls are the trees, the vines and the shrubs, waving in the distant\r\nhorizon and flinging their branches on the sky line, or close at hand\r\nwhere we hear the voice of the wind among the leaves.\r\n\r\nA wondrous floor is the garden's cathedral of emerald green in the\r\nsummer, sprinkled with flowers, of ermine whiteness in the winter,\r\nsparkling with the diamonds of frost. Its choir is the winds, the\r\nsinging birds and the hum of insects. Its builder and maker is God. Man\r\ngoeth to his garden in the springtime, and, behold, all is mystery.\r\nThere is the mystery of life about him, in the flowing sap in the trees,\r\nthe springing of the green grass, the awakening of the insect world, the\r\nhatching of the worm from the egg, the changing of the worm into the\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nThe seed the gardener holds in his hand is a mystery. He knows what it\r\nwill produce, but why one phlox seed will produce a red blossom and\r\nanother a white is to him a miracle. He wonders at the prodigality of\r\nnature. In her economy, what is one or ten thousand seeds! She scatters\r\nthem with lavish hand from ragweed, thistle or oak. If man could make\r\nbut the single seed of the ragweed, he could make a world. The distance\r\nbetween a pansy and a planet is no greater than between man and a pansy.\r\nThe gardener sees the same infinite care bestowed upon the lowest as\r\nupon the highest form of life, and he wonders at it. He looks into the\r\nface of a flower, scans the butterfly and notes the toadstool and sees\r\nthat each is wonderful.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he enters his garden in the springtime until he leaves it\r\nin the autumn, he will find a place and a time to worship in his\r\ncathedral. He enters it with the seed in his hand in the spring, and as\r\nhe rakes away the ripened plants in the autumn he finds something still\r\nof the mystery of life. A puff-ball is before him, and he muses on its\r\nforming. The little puff-ball stands at one end of the scale of life and\r\nhe, man, at the other, \"close to the realm where angels have their\r\nbirth, just on the boundary of the spirit land.\" From the things visible\r\nin our garden we learn of the things invisible, and strong the faith of\r\nhim who kneeling in adoration of the growing plant looks from nature to\r\nnature's God and finds the peace which passeth understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing the Producer and Consumer Together.\r\n\r\nR. S. MACKINTOSH, HORTICULTURAL SPECIALIST, AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION\r\nDIVISION, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Mr. Producer to Mr. Consumer directly, and not by\r\nproxy, is the chief desire of the present time. The fact remains,\r\nhowever, that in the vast majority of cases Messrs. Proxy & Co. is\r\nbrought in and breaks up the direct personal contact. The development of\r\ncomplex marketing means specialization and in a large degree sets it\r\napart from production. When specialization becomes dominant, then\r\nstandardization becomes necessary. Each producer is unable to keep in\r\ntouch with all such movements and consequently finds it hard to keep\r\nabreast of the times. In this age of rapid transit, specialization,\r\nscientific discoveries, and the improvements resulting therefrom, seem\r\nsomewhat out of place when compared with our present marketing systems.\r\nThis does not mean that our marketing is entirely out of joint, but it\r\ndoes mean that there is something the matter or so many would not be\r\ndiscussing it. The consumer hears what the producer received, the\r\nproducer hears what the consumer paid, and then somebody gets to\r\nthinking and talking. Discussions lead to investigations, and\r\ninvestigations lead to conferences. Just lately a large conference was\r\nheld in Chicago, and certain plans were formulated to attempt to unravel\r\nsome of the evils that exist in marketing. So much has been said that\r\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture has begun certain investigations, and\r\nwe hope that the workers will find ways to solve some of the troubles in\r\na logical and, we hope, sane way.\r\n\r\nA year ago your committee on marketing reported that there were certain\r\nthings needed, and an ideal system was suggested to correct these\r\nfaults. One of the basic factors emphasized was standardization. Another\r\ncommittee reported on changes needed in the statutes regarding the\r\nweight of a bushel of apples. Congress has enacted a law which specifies\r\nthe size of a barrel for apples. New York, Massachusetts and other\r\nstates have enacted grading laws. Some states require that the fruit be\r\nfree of certain insect and disease injuries. Several states have laws\r\nregulating commission men. Most states have laws which do not allow the\r\nsale of food products that are decayed. These are all steps toward the\r\nstandardization that is so necessary. In other words, the several laws\r\nhave been passed to correct some of the troubles which have come up when\r\nso many hands handle the products. These laws were not needed in olden\r\ntimes when the consumer went directly to the producer's door and there\r\nbargained for his wares.\r\n\r\nMinnesota is a state noted for co-operative enterprises. There are over\r\ntwo thousand such organizations doing more than $60,000,000.00 worth of\r\nbusiness yearly. We know full well the value of the co-operative\r\ncreameries and how butter has been brought up to a high standard. As\r\ncitizens, we rejoice; as horticulturists, and citizens as well, we want\r\nour products to stand high in the estimation of others. I was much\r\npained this summer while discussing the marketing of apples with several\r\ncommission men to hear them say that they did not like to take local\r\nshipments. The reason was that the goods were usually below grade, and\r\nthe returns did not always please the growers. It is evident that we\r\nmust improve our methods in ways which will remove this stigma. Many of\r\nthe commission men try to induce good grading and packing. They like to\r\nhandle \"top notch\" goods, for it is cheaper to handle goods that move\r\nquickly than those that are a drag and require too much handling. The\r\nAgricultural Extension Division of the College of Agriculture is\r\norganized to give help, where help is needed, along a large number of\r\nagricultural lines.\r\n\r\nRealizing these facts, we have been trying to get the ear of the\r\nproducer and consumer in an effort to get them to do certain things. On\r\nthe one hand, we want to have good varieties, and to help this lectures\r\nand demonstrations are given in the care of the orchard, pruning,\r\nspraying, thinning, picking, grading, packing and marketing. On the\r\nother hand we want more people to eat Minnesota apples. It is a campaign\r\nof education and publicity.\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to sell anything, he finds that he must advertise. He must\r\nadvertise so much and in so many ways that people cannot help buying his\r\nwares. There are certain widely advertised articles that you must know,\r\nwhether you are interested or not. One of these runs along the highways\r\nso often that you are shaken, even against your will, into consciousness\r\nof its existence, so that you cannot get along without having one, or at\r\nleast seeing one. The latest edition seems to have put on feathers in\r\nthe form of a white dove of peace. May it succeed. Advertising Minnesota\r\napples has been attempted this past year.\r\n\r\nIt was found necessary to provide a standard by which the buyer and\r\nseller could agree on apple grades. After consulting several persons, it\r\nwas decided to adopt the following grades:\r\n\r\n\"A\" Grade.--Hand picked, normal shape, good color (at least one-third\r\ncolored), free from dirt, disease and insect injuries, and well packed.\r\nLimit of defects allowed: Not more than 10% of all kinds nor 5% of any\r\none kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. R. S. Mackintosh--Horticulturist connected with\r\nExtension Division, University Farm, St. Paul.]\r\n\r\n\"B\" Grade.--Hand picked, practically normal shape, practically free from\r\ndirt, disease and insect injuries, and properly packed. Limit of defects\r\nallowed: Not more than 15% of all nor 5% of any one kind.\r\n\r\nOnly one variety and grade should be put in a package. In the grade\r\nspecifications given, normal shape refers to the general form of\r\nwell-grown specimens of the variety in question. For instance: The\r\nWealthy is regular in outline and nearly round, while the Hibernal is\r\nsomewhat flat and often irregular. In like manner the color must be\r\ntypical of the variety, whether green, yellow or red. Red apples usually\r\nsell better than green or yellow varieties, although the quality may be\r\neven poorer. Fruit showing insect or disease injuries cannot be classed\r\nas well grown. Grading to size is very important. This is not specified\r\nbecause it depends upon the variety and season. Only apples above a\r\nselected minimum size, as 2-1/2 inches, the diameter at right angles to\r\nstem, should be placed in the same package. Defects refer to apples not\r\nup to grade in size, color or shape and having bruises, punctures,\r\ndisease or insect injuries.\r\n\r\n_Fancy._--For persons having extra choice fruit, a fancy grade can be\r\nused. Well-grown specimens, hand picked, of normal shape, at least\r\ntwo-thirds colored, free from dirt, diseases and insect injuries and\r\nproperly packed. Not more than 5% of combined defects allowed, of which\r\nonly 2% can be of the same kind.\r\n\r\nHundreds of letters were sent to persons in the state, telling them that\r\nwe would maintain an information bureau or clearing house to help them\r\nin finding markets for their apples. Several growers replied, and the\r\nnames of persons who were anxious to buy apples were given them. Nine\r\nfarmers' clubs asked for information as to where Minnesota apples could\r\nbe bought. This is a beginning, and it shows that there is need for some\r\nsort of an organization that can find out where apples are and who wants\r\nthem. The intention has not been to interfere with the regular trade\r\nroutes, but to give the growers information as to who wants apples. As\r\nyou will notice, this does not bring the producer directly to the door\r\nof the consumer. There must be some one to act as a go-between in most\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIt was just stated that Minnesota is a state having a very large number\r\nof co-operative business organizations. Among these are about two\r\nhundred live stock shipping associations having a very simple form of\r\norganization. A number of persons in a community, having considerable\r\nstock to ship, come together, adopt a simple set of by-laws which\r\nprovide for the selection of a manager, his compensation--usually a\r\ncertain percentage on the gross receipts--and a small amount for losses\r\nwhich may occur. No capital stock is required--only the actual living\r\nstock. The manager ships the stock at certain times, and when the\r\nreturns come in deducts the amounts provided for expenses and then\r\nreturns to each shipper his proportionate amount. In this way the stock\r\nis sold at the terminal yards the same day and with other stock from\r\nmany sections. It is a very simple, satisfactory way of marketing.\r\n\r\nThe more I study and think of our apple situation, the more I am of the\r\nopinion that a very large part of our fruit could be marketed in a\r\nsimilar way. Some of our La Crescent friends ship together in carlots\r\nsuccessfully. Why not others? This is the very best way to begin\r\nco-operation in a successful way. As Mr. Collingwood says:\r\n\"Co-operation, like charity, should begin at home and be well nurtured.\"\r\nIn other words, begin to co-operate at home in a small way and let the\r\nfuture large organizations take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, let the growers in a community meet and form a\r\nfruit-shipping association with by-laws patterned after the successful\r\nstock-shipping associations. Then the fruit should be well grown, picked\r\nin time, graded thoroughly and honestly packed and marked. Haul at once\r\nto car. The manager will take charge and ship as he thinks best. Each\r\npackage must have the customary identification marks, so the manager can\r\nkeep an accurate record of all transactions. If, by chance, trouble\r\ncomes up, the shippers can pool their interests, and send a\r\nrepresentative to find out the trouble. Thus they can do together what\r\neach cannot do alone. Even this does not bring the consumers directly in\r\ncontact with the producers. It is, however, a step nearer.\r\n\r\nThe public auctions started in New York this season seem to have been\r\nsuccessful, and it may mean an innovation which will improve marketing\r\nconditions in general. These auctions are held under the recently formed\r\nDepartment of Foods and Markets. The Department has contracted with a\r\nlarge auction company which advances the freight, conducts the sales,\r\nguarantees the accounts, and advances the net returns for the goods\r\ndaily. The producer is able to get returns within two days. The total\r\ncost is 5% on the gross sales; 3% for the auction company and 2% for the\r\nDepartment of Markets for the advertising and for other overhead\r\nexpenses. Posters have been issued to advertise New York State apples.\r\nAs this Department has been working only for a short time, it is too\r\nearly to tell whether it is a success in every way.\r\n\r\nWe earnestly ask your co-operation in trying to solve the question of\r\nmarketing Minnesota apples. All interested must assist in this important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWORLD'S TALLEST TREES.--The tallest trees are the Australian\r\neucalyptus, which attain a height of 480 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDY CHRYSANTHEMUMS.\r\n\r\nThe new type of hardy chrysanthemums called \"early-flowering\" has been\r\nlargely developed by a Frenchman named August Nonin, of Paris, who has\r\ndevoted much of his life to perfecting this strain from seedlings of the\r\nold-fashioned \"mums\" of our grandmothers' gardens. It is considered by\r\nfar the most satisfactory kind to grow out of doors, blossoming earlier\r\nthan the pompons. A few of the best of these early-flowering types are:\r\nWhite--Crawford White, Dorothy, Milka and Normandie; yellow--E'toile\r\nd'Or, Carrie, October Gold; pink--Beaurepaire, Eden, Le Danube; red and\r\nbronze shades--Harvest Home, Firelight, A. Barham and Billancourt. These\r\nare the earliest bloomers of this type.\r\n\r\nHardy pompons are still most largely grown for outdoor flowering, but of\r\nthese there is also a choice, as the earliest bloomers are the most\r\ndesirable to use. Lilian Doty, a large-flowered, clear, bright pink, is\r\nconsidered the very best of these. Donald and Minta are other good\r\npinks. The earliest whites are Queen of the Whites, Waco, Grace and\r\nMyer's Perfection. Jeanette, Wm. Sabey, Golden Climax and Zenobia are\r\nthe best yellows, and Julia Lagravere, Urith and Tiber the best crimson\r\nand bronze shades. There are many other beautiful pompons, but they\r\nbloom too late for practical out-of-door use.\r\n\r\nThe single mums have of late been used successfully out-of-doors when\r\nearly blooming varieties have been chosen.\r\n\r\nOf these Elsa, Gladys Duckham and Mensa are the earliest whites: Ivor\r\nGrant, Mrs. Southbridge and Mrs. Buckingham the earliest pinks;\r\nJosephine, Golden Mensa and Marion Sutherland the earliest yellows; and\r\nSilvia Slade, Ceddie Mason and Brightness the earliest crimson and\r\nbronze shades.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is warm enough in the spring the plants should be set out\r\nabout twelve inches apart in rich garden soil, and kept pinched back\r\nduring May and June to insure a stocky growth. If one has old clumps in\r\nthe garden, they should be taken up and divided and set in new earth\r\njust as any old perennial plant would be treated.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot summer weather they should be well watered once a week\r\nand sprayed in the cool of the evening. This will keep down the black\r\nand green aphis, the worst enemies of mums. In case these pests become a\r\nmenace a spray of tobacco water will end the trouble. A little bone meal\r\nor well rotted manure dug about the plants in August will help to\r\nproduce fine blooms.\r\n\r\nA gardener who has never yet lost a plant through winter-killing treats\r\nthem as follows: After they have finished blooming he cuts them down to\r\nabout eight inches above the ground and lets the leaves blow in on the\r\nbed, covering to a depth of six or eight inches. Then he lays pine\r\nbranches over the beds to prevent the leaves from blowing away. So\r\ntreated, the plants will remain frozen all winter. They should in all\r\ncases be set in a well drained position, as they will not stand \"wet\r\nfeet.\" Uncover with the other perennials in the spring.--Mrs. E. W.\r\nGould.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN.\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota honey crop of 1916 will probably be a record breaker. This\r\nbrings up the question of how to market this crop to the best advantage.\r\nLet me state at once that the greatest obstacle to free and easy selling\r\nof honey is the careless, untidy, sometimes unsanitary way some\r\nbee-keepers put up their honey for the market--spoiling the appetite of\r\nthe public for this most delicious of nature's foods not only for\r\nthemselves but also for progressive and up-to-date bee-keepers. The\r\nresult of this big honey crop will be to eliminate the No. 2 and No. 3\r\nbee-keeper and his honey from the market until No. 1 has sold out his\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nA short article like this cannot make a good bee-keeper out of a poor\r\none, it can only serve as a reminder to those who know how \"lest they\r\nforget.\" Moreover, the most careless and backward bee-keepers imagine\r\nthat they are crackerjacks at their trade, thus putting themselves\r\nbeyond the possibility of becoming anything. It takes a thousand\r\nhammer-blows to drive home a truth or a useful idea.\r\n\r\nIf comb honey is your specialty observe the national grading and packing\r\nrules. They are printed in all bee papers and magazines, and have been\r\ngiven all possible publication to reach you.\r\n\r\nTo obtain fancy comb honey your sections must have been made over strong\r\ncolonies in No. 1 white, new sections with extra thin top and bottom\r\nstarters. After the honey flow is over in your locality (which you can\r\ndetect by the tendency of bees to rob and be cross) remove your comb\r\nhoney at once. By leaving it on, travel stained and propolis spotted\r\nsections will result. The snow white finish of the comb will be\r\ndiscolored, the wood will assume that \"used and handled\" appearance\r\nwhich is not attractive to the buyer. The sections must be graded fancy,\r\nNo. 1 and No. 2. Every section must be scraped around the edges and all\r\npropolis removed. Some bee-keepers even polish the wood of the section\r\nuntil it looks as clean as if it just came from the factory.\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning and grading put up your honey into standard shipping\r\ncases. Do not ship it in the super where it was raised nor in a soap\r\nbox. If shipped to a distant market by freight or express, eight\r\nshipping cases must be packed together into one honey crate provided\r\nwith handles. The tendency of late is to put up each comb in a separate\r\npaper box with transparent front to keep the honey free from flies and\r\nfinger-marks. This practice deserves universal adoption.\r\n\r\nIf you produce extracted honey you may leave your honey with bees for a\r\nweek or two after the honey flow is over. Extracting should be done in\r\nhot weather, during August or early part of September. A modern hand or\r\npower extractor is an absolute necessity. There are still a few old\r\ntimers who \"butcher\" their bees late in the fall, and render the honey\r\nby the \"hand mash and sheet strain\" method, but they are only relics of\r\na poetical past and going fast.\r\n\r\nHoney to be extracted must be well capped over. If extracted too thin it\r\nwill ferment and get sour. If left with bees too long it will be too\r\nthick and hard to extract. Extracting ought to be done in a bee-tight\r\nroom to keep out robber bees. Extracted supers may be returned to the\r\nbees in the evening or piled up at a distance in a safe place for bees\r\nto clean out. Extracted honey must be left to stand in a settling tank\r\nfor about a week, or until all air bubbles and wax particles have risen\r\nto the top. It should be put up into five gallon cans or barrels for\r\nwholesale trade. For retail trade it should be bottled when needed, else\r\nit will candy in the glass. Bottling it hot or heating it after bottling\r\nwill delay crystallization for a considerable period. The bottles ought\r\nto be white, clean and labeled with your name. Each kind of container\r\nshould be well packed in a wooden shipping case. Do not make it a\r\npractice to sell a large amount to a customer at once, sell rather\r\nsmaller amounts at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD NOTES.\r\n\r\nConducted monthly by R. S. MACKINTOSH, Horticulturist, Extension\r\nDivision, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in a while it is well to pause for a few moments to consider some\r\nof the results of past efforts. We have been growing apples in Minnesota\r\nin large quantities. Insects and diseases are causing more damage each\r\nyear, and this has lead us to pay more attention to the prevention of\r\nthese pests. A regular spraying program has been outlined, and many\r\npersons have adopted it. What are the results? It seems to us that the\r\nresults of spraying at West Concord, Minn., should be made known to the\r\nreaders of the MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST. It indicates very\r\nclearly the value of spraying and how someone in a community can take\r\ncharge and diligently push for better methods. In this case the\r\ninstructor in agriculture, with the aid of his superintendent and board\r\nof education, secured a power sprayer and began to spray the orchards in\r\nthe vicinity. At first it was necessary to ask the owners if they might\r\nspray their trees. After three years, however, the owners appealed to\r\nProf. Updegraff to have their trees sprayed. This year he had more work\r\nthan he could manage. Demonstrations of this kind show the value of the\r\nwork so vividly that the most skeptical gradually becomes convinced of\r\nits value.\r\n\r\nSeveral schools have purchased spraying outfits. We hope that we shall\r\nhear from more of them in the future. In many cases the spraying outfit\r\nis used for whitewashing the interior of barns and other buildings.\r\n\r\nReports that come to the Agricultural Extension Division indicate that\r\nthere will be a surplus of apples in some sections this year. We want to\r\nassist in the distribution of the surplus and shall continue the Apple\r\nClearing House again this year. If you have more apples than you can\r\nsell locally please let the division know what you have to sell. Address\r\nthe Agricultural Extension Division, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nApples for market must be graded and packed properly if they are to be\r\nsold through the regular trade routes. The barrel is the standard\r\npackage in most parts of the country. The bushel basket is being used\r\nfor early fruit in some markets. All fruit for sale should be _hand\r\npicked from the tree_ (not from the ground) and allowed to cool. Grade\r\naccording to size and freedom from insect and other injuries. Pack\r\ncarefully so as to avoid bruising. When cover is put on press firmly in\r\nplace. Do not allow fruit to shake about while in transit. Pick early\r\nmaturing fruit while more or less green. Ripe fruit will not keep well\r\nduring hot weather. (See page 321 of this number.)\r\n\r\nLate August and September is the time when practically all our county\r\nfairs are held. It is hoped that the exhibits of fruits, vegetables and\r\nflowers will be large and of good quality. Follow the premium list very\r\ncarefully. Put on the plate the right number of specimens. Pick apples\r\nso as to leave stems attached. Quality means specimens of perfect shape\r\nfor the variety, free of insect or disease injuries, without bruises and\r\nwell colored. Vegetables should be well selected in every particular.\r\nSelect the specimens that you would like to use. The overgrown specimens\r\nare not always the best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VALLEY LAWN WITH SHRUBBERY ON BORDER OF WOODS.\r\nFORMERLY OCCUPIED BY HENHOUSE AND YARDS.\r\n\r\nView on same grounds with garden pergola shown on page 331.]\r\n\r\n     While it is not the intention to publish anything in this\r\n     magazine that is misleading or unreliable, yet it must be\r\n     remembered that the articles published herein recite the\r\n     experience and opinions of their writers, and this fact must\r\n     always be noted In estimating their practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST\r\n\r\nVol. 44 SEPTEMBER, 1916 No. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pergola--Its Use and Misuse, Convenience and Expense.\r\n\r\nCHAS. H. RAMSDELL, LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT, MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me take you by a brief word picture to Italy, the first home of the\r\npergola as we see it hereabouts today. On the hills and vineyards above\r\nthe sea, in that sunny land, I can see a beautiful home or villa,\r\nseemingly about to tumble off the rocky point on which it rests. Indeed,\r\nso scant is the space about the building that none is left for trees to\r\nshade the white house from the heat of the tropic sun. But shade must be\r\nhad to break the glare of the noonday. The vine and the grape thrive\r\namazingly near the sea, and this necessity evolved the pergola. It was\r\ncompact, could be made straight or curving, short or long, usually\r\nnarrow but still supporting to some height the delicate leaves and fruit\r\nof the grape. Thus, the Italian secured his shade and made an\r\ninteresting walk or approach. Because of its open work and light\r\nproportions the views of the beautiful Italian sea and sunset were not\r\nblocked but thereby improved, each view framed in by the pergola\r\npillars, with the picturesque tracery of the vine clinging to them.\r\n\r\nHere was its home, and here it was perfect in its setting. We Americans,\r\nin our zeal to secure all that's good, have brought it bodily to our\r\nhomes. But like much else that's transplanted, we do not always look\r\nwell to the new conditions as comparable to the old. The pergola is,\r\nhowever, too valuable a garden feature to do without. Our greater care\r\nshould be to study our need, use the pergola when advisable for some\r\nother feature, like one of those illustrated on this sheet, when more\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\nIn construction the pergola is usually made of materials to match the\r\nhouse, sometimes masonry or stone pillars as well as those of wood. The\r\nrafters and lighter beams should be made of the most durable wood,\r\npreferably cypress, and carefully painted. The pillars may be of classic\r\ndesign or of more modern lines, but if they are of a thickness greater\r\nthan one-seventh of their height, they are not proportionate to the\r\nlight load they carry. Preferably, the columns rest on and are anchored\r\nto concrete or stone footings in the ground. The supporting rafters from\r\npillar to pillar are the heavier construction, the cross beams, etc.,\r\nthe lighter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pergola over garden gate, with planting to screen kitchen\r\ngarden, in Minneapolis.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ground beneath the pergola should be made of weather\r\nproof brick or tile floors. They shed the surface water and make it\r\nuseable in damp weather, not possible with the turf.\r\n\r\nThe cost of these structures is largely optional with the builder. One\r\nclever with carpenter's tools can build one at the cost of his time and\r\nlumber. The other limit cannot be set. Masonry pillars, cypress lumber,\r\npavement of the floor, the size, cost of design, etc., will, upon\r\noccasion, bring up this cost to that of a small house. I have found a\r\nfirm in Chicago who will ship one complete, ready to set up, following\r\none's own design, or, after submitting standard designs and photographs\r\nof their work. They sell one 8 feet long, 7 feet 6 inches wide and 7\r\nfeet 6 inches high with 10-inch columns for $45.00, each additional\r\n8-foot section $25.00, f.o.b., Chicago. The pictures shown of such a\r\npergola are highly attractive. From this figure the cost runs up to\r\n$500.00 and even $1,000.00 for circular construction eight-four long and\r\ncorrespondingly heavy. Of course, one can secure low figures from any\r\nlocal millwork company if a good detailed design is available. In this\r\nway good distinctive work is possible.\r\n\r\nIts uses are infinite. It may serve to connect the architectural lines\r\nof the house with garage or other smaller building. It may lead from\r\nhouse to garden, or along an overlook walk along the river or lake. It\r\nmay encircle a garden pool or an important statue. It can be made an\r\napproach to a band stand, or other park building. It will make part of\r\nthe garden background, but should not be depended upon without the\r\nhigher foliage so eminently desirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A garden pergola erected last summer on clients' grounds\r\nsouth of Lake Harriet, Minneapolis--covering walk from house to garden,\r\nsixty five feet long.]\r\n\r\nDo not make the mistake of expecting a pergola to serve as a porch or\r\noutdoor place to sit or sleep. One needs the roof of a tea house to keep\r\noff the evening dews or occasional shower. It cannot be made a large\r\nfeature of the grounds like a garden. It is not important enough. It\r\nwill not, without trees and high shrubs behind it, make any background\r\nas will a garden wall or lattice. It is no barrier along a street or of\r\nany use as a fence or division line. And sometimes the lines of a house\r\nor building may be better carried by a rose arch or vine arch without\r\nthe expense of a pergola. Thus you see it has its limited place, and its\r\nuse must be decided upon with good taste and judgment.\r\n\r\nThe pergola is almost incomplete without the growing vines on it. A four\r\nyears' growth of Beta or Janesville grapes (which we don't have to lay\r\ndown for winter), will give one a beautiful showing of the hanging fall\r\nfruit. The bittersweet is also good with yellow fall fruit. The several\r\nvarieties of clematis are desirable if combined with the heavier growing\r\ngrape or woodbine. The woodbine is good for its fall color, although\r\nweedy in growth.\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota honeysuckle should be mentioned, also the Dutchman's Pipe\r\nand the Solanum, all good in a limited way. The climbing roses are all\r\nright to use, although they lack foliage background and have to be laid\r\ndown every winter. However, I like to believe the man who designed the\r\nfirst pergola had the grape vine in his mind in so doing, for the two\r\nfit conditions like hand and glove.\r\n\r\nIt is a structure of charming possibilities. Its lines curve as well as\r\nany other feature. Its proportions should be always light and graceful.\r\nIt adds much to almost any garden or home grounds when carefully used.\r\nIts open work overhead typifies the freedom of the outdoors. It also\r\nrecalls the vine and its growth to the light. And if we temper our\r\nenthusiasm with good sense, its use will be fortunate and the result a\r\nhappy one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking and Marketing Apples.\r\n\r\nH. M. DUNLAP, PRES. ILL. ORCHARD CO., SAVOY, ILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing of apples is one problem, the marketing is another. The two\r\nare intimately related but entirely different. It is essential in\r\nobtaining the best results to first grow good apples for the market.\r\nThis, like the darkey's receipt for rabbit soup, comes first. The darkey\r\nsays, \"first kotch your rabbit.\"\r\n\r\nMany a grower who understands fairly well how to produce good fruit is\r\nlost when it comes to selling it to an advantage to himself. You notice\r\nthat I said \"to himself.\" It is often done to the advantage of the\r\nbuyer. Like most inventors the apple grower usually needs assistance in\r\nselling what he has produced. The grower who connects up with the best\r\nmethods in this particular gets best results.\r\n\r\nNo one can long be successful whose methods are not careful and honest\r\nin the packing of apples.\r\n\r\n_Equipment for Harvesting the Apple Crop._--There are some who insist\r\nthat the only way to pick apples is to use a basket lined with cloth.\r\nThese insist that the use of the basket in picking is the most careful\r\nmethod and that the bruising of the apples is reduced to a minimum. I\r\nhave, however, seen apples handled very roughly in baskets. The picker\r\nhangs the basket on the tree, on the ladder rung, or sets it on the\r\nground and then proceeds to shoot the apples into the basket from\r\ndistances of one foot or six or eight feet away.\r\n\r\nThe bottomless picking sack, with broad straps across the shoulders, has\r\ncome into use within the past few years in many commercial orchards. My\r\nexperience is that either the basket or sack is good if rightly handled,\r\nand either may be objectionable if care is not exercised.\r\n\r\nMy own experience after using both is in favor of the sack. If care is\r\nused no more bruising will be done than with the basket, and it is far\r\nmore expeditious. Both hands are at liberty for use in the picking. The\r\nsack should not be shifted about, and the picker should not be allowed\r\nto lean against the rungs of the ladder with the filled sack between.\r\nThe sack should be lowered into the picking crate so that the apples\r\nhave no drop in emptying the sack. Pointed ladders are the best for tall\r\ntrees and less liable to injure the tree or turn turtle and upset the\r\npicker.\r\n\r\nA packing house is essential if best results are to be obtained, but\r\nmany growers use the canvas-covered table in the orchard, picking and\r\npacking the product from sixteen to thirty-six trees at a sitting, and\r\nthen moving the table to the next center, and in this way the entire\r\norchard. In good weather this is not so bad as might seem, but at times\r\nthe sun is very hot, or sudden showers saturate everything, and in the\r\nlate fall the weather is too cold and frosty for comfort. On the whole,\r\ntherefore, a good sized packing house or shed built at a convenient\r\nplace in or near the orchard is the more desirable method of handling\r\nthe crop. This building must be large enough to give room for a sorting\r\ntable three feet wide by sixteen or more feet in length, or, better\r\nstill, room for an apple grading machine of best pattern, which will\r\noccupy about three feet by twenty feet. There should be a space on one\r\nside or end of the building for unloading the bushel crates with which\r\nall well regulated orchards should be equipped, when they come from the\r\norchard. These crates can be stacked up four or five deep, and there\r\nshould be adequate room for these based on necessities. There should be\r\nroom for at least a day's supply of apple barrels and a place to cooper\r\nthem up by driving the hoops and nailing same. There should be enough\r\nroom to face and fill barrels and head them up and to stack up enough\r\nfor half a day's hauling ahead.\r\n\r\nThe size of this building will depend upon whether you are barreling 100\r\nbarrels per day or 1,000 barrels. For the former a building 28x20 feet\r\nwill answer very well. For the latter amount 60x100 feet would be none\r\ntoo large. This building should have skylights in the roof. I build\r\nthese of ordinary greenhouse sash about 3x6 feet, usually putting in two\r\nof these in each building on the north or east side of the roof,\r\naccording to the slope, and directly over the sorting end of the table.\r\nThis will give you light an average of thirty minutes more each day and\r\nprolong the day's work that much, or at least make it possible to do\r\nbetter work on cloudy days and in the evenings.\r\n\r\nThe building should be approachable on all four sides with the wagon,\r\nand doors either sliding or hinged should open at least ten feet wide\r\nfor taking apples in and out. For example, I have my sheds arranged to\r\ntake the fruit as it comes from the orchard on one side of the building.\r\nThe number one apples go out one door, and in case I use a grader the\r\nnumber two go out another side. The cider apples also take their route.\r\nThe fourth side is used for supplying empty barrels as needed. Thus you\r\nsee the necessity for getting to all four sides. On the side where the\r\nfilled barrels are loaded onto the wagon there should be a raised\r\nplatform so that the loading can be carefully and easily done. A bin for\r\nthe cider or vinegar apples should be built with a roof on same.\r\n\r\nLow-wheeled, platform wagons are needed to haul fruit from the orchard\r\nto the packing house.\r\n\r\n_The standard barrel of three bushels_ capacity is used generally by the\r\ncommercial orchardist in preference to the box. Good hoops are growing\r\nscarcer every year, and some, including myself, are using two or four of\r\nthe six hoops required of the twisted splice steel wire variety as being\r\nboth safer and more economical. In transit or in storage they hold\r\nbetter and do not break and scatter the contents of the barrel over the\r\ncar floor or storage warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe best floor for the apple house is concrete. The next best is to\r\ncover the ground with coal cinders and lay 2x4 flat on the cinders,\r\nfilling between them with cinders to a level and nailing the floor\r\nboards to these 2x4. This gives a good solid floor at little expense.\r\n\r\nThe walls are of 4x4 uprights, about eight feet apart, resting on 8×8×12\r\nconcrete blocks with a half inch iron rod imbedded in the concrete and\r\ncountersunk in lower end of upright 4×4 to keep the latter in place.\r\nNail ties of 2×4 are used, and to these are nailed common lumber\r\nsurfaced. The roof consists of 2×4 or 2×6 rafters, usually three feet\r\napart, with 1×6 boards spaced about three feet apart as sheeting. The\r\ncovering in this case is of galvanized corrugated iron, suitable length,\r\nof No. 26 gauge. The doors of this building should be on rollers, and\r\nwith two or more double doors on each of the four sides to give plenty\r\nof light and easy access to and from the building. The roof and dry\r\nfloor are the important parts of such a building, and you only need the\r\nwalls as a support and occasionally to break off the wind when weather\r\nbecomes chilly. What you should avoid in a packing house is narrow\r\ndoors, dark interior and access from only one or two sides.\r\n\r\n_Picking._--I have found it most satisfactory to pick by the bushel,\r\nkeeping a foreman in the orchard to see that crates are filled full,\r\nladders and apples carefully handled. Each picker is provided with\r\ntickets of a certain number which corresponds to the one opposite his\r\nname on the sheet tacked to a small board or clip carried by the\r\nforeman. Each picker is assigned a tree, and his empty boxes are\r\ndistributed to him from the wagon. When filled the number is tabulated\r\nby the foreman and loaded onto the wagon and hauled to the packing shed.\r\nHere they are stacked up and afterwards emptied onto the sorting tables\r\nor machine grader, and from thence into the barrels.\r\n\r\n_Hauling to Market._--The barrels when filled are not allowed to lie\r\naround, but are hauled immediately to the car or storage. Failure of\r\nwinter apples to keep in storage may often be traced to the packing\r\nshed, where the apples stand in the crates or lie in the barrels for a\r\nnumber of days, perhaps a week or two in warm weather, before they are\r\nforwarded to storage. Sometimes delays occur at the storage owing to\r\nrush, and apples remain sometimes for a week or ten days in cars before\r\nthey are unloaded. It behooves the grower not only to watch his own\r\npacking house for delays, but the storage company also. In one instance\r\nI lost $1,000 on five cars of apples that were without refrigeration\r\nfive weeks owing to the storage warehouse not being completed. I knew\r\nnothing about this until two years afterwards.\r\n\r\nHauling to the station is done on wagons or motor trucks equipped with a\r\nrack that permits the barrels being carried lying down, but supported at\r\neach end of the barrel so that the weight of the barrel does not come\r\nupon the bilge. They can be so racked up that one wagon will carry\r\nfifty-five barrels. A three-ton truck will carry forty barrels of apples\r\nand haul forty more on trailer. Such an outfit in one of my orchards\r\nmakes five trips in one day a distance of four miles, traversing forty\r\nmiles and carrying 400 barrels of apples. One and one-half miles of this\r\nis over a well-graded dirt road, and two and one-half over brick and\r\nconcrete pavement. In our Clay County, Illinois, orchards we have two\r\n12-25 gasoline tractors that are used for cultivating during the summer\r\nand for hauling apples in the fall. These machines easily haul 110\r\nbarrels of apples on two wagons and make two trips a distance of five\r\nmiles from orchard to town.\r\n\r\n_Loading Cars._--I am surprised at the lack of knowledge of how to\r\nproperly load barreled apples into cars. Over half the cars going to\r\nmarket are improperly loaded. The best way is to place all the barrels\r\ncrosswise of the cars with lower tier to the right side of the car, and\r\nthe second tier the left of the car with the bilge lying in the hollows\r\nof the lower tier. The third tier should be at the right side again\r\ndirectly over the lower tier. If a fourth tier is added they should be\r\nat the left and directly over the second tier. In this way your apples\r\nare loaded to carry with the least injury to the apples. Being uniformly\r\nloaded they are easily counted from the top after they are in the car,\r\nand your loader can verify his wagon load count after the apples are all\r\nin and thus prevent mistakes.\r\n\r\n_Packing Apples._--The packing season is a busy one. Often the grower\r\nfinds himself short of help, and when this is hard to get he is sure up\r\nagainst it if he wants to do a good job of packing.\r\n\r\nFirst make your estimate of the crop you have to harvest. If\r\ninexperienced, get an experienced man to help you. You need this\r\nestimate for two reasons. You must determine the number of packages you\r\nneed, which must be contracted for in advance, and you need to know how\r\nmuch labor you need to get the crop in within the time limit. You should\r\nnot begin harvesting too early, for immature fruit, poorly colored,\r\nbrings a lower price, and you do not want to be so late that the fruit\r\nmellows up or drops from the trees before it is gathered or is caught by\r\na freeze.\r\n\r\nI will relate a little experience of mine in the latter connection. In\r\nthe autumn of 1911 I had a heavy crop on a hundred and twenty acre\r\norchard. The season was rainy, and we lost six days during October,\r\nwhich put us across the line into November with our picking. The last\r\ndays of October or first of November brought a severe freeze when the\r\nmercury went to twenty, or twelve below freezing. This lasted two nights\r\nand one day. The apples were frozen absolutely solid through and through\r\non the trees. As I had over 12,000 bushels, all Willow Twigs,\r\nunharvested, it was an anxious time for me. The second day was cloudy\r\nwith the temperature at thirty-four degrees, just freezing, and the\r\nfollowing night it remained at the same point, for we were enough\r\ninterested to note the temperature. This continued up until noon of the\r\nthird day, when the frost was out of the apples and we proceeded with\r\nour picking. These apples kept perfectly and were sold the next May at\r\n$4.50 per barrel. There was no perceptible difference between the\r\napples picked before or after the freeze. Two years later my experience\r\nwas different. We were caught with 1,000 bushels on the trees by an\r\nequally severe freeze. The sun came out bright the following morning,\r\nand by noon the temperature was up to fifty degrees. The apples turned\r\nbrown and looked like they had been baked. They were good only for\r\nvinegar. The variety in both cases was Willow.\r\n\r\nIn packing apples it is a good plan to use a corrugated paper cap on\r\nboth ends of the barrel, in addition to a waxed paper next to the apples\r\non the face end, stenciled with the name of the grower and his\r\npostoffice address. Use uniform sized apples for the face as much as\r\npossible, and of good color. The face is permitted to be 20 per cent.\r\nbetter than the contents. Drop facing I consider best for the second\r\nlayer rather than double facing, as it holds the face apple in position\r\nbetter and presents a more solid face to the buyer when opened. The\r\nbarrels should be filled uniformly from bottom to top with an even grade\r\nof fruit. No reputable packer will attempt any fraud upon the purchaser\r\nin this respect. In tailing off the barrel preparatory to putting in the\r\nhead, the better way is to face the apples on their side in concentric\r\nrings with the color side of the apple up. I would not select these\r\napples as to size or color, but let them correctly represent both as\r\nthey run through the barrel. There can be no objection, however, to your\r\nputting the colored side of the apple up. We should always look as well\r\nas we can, and first impressions if good, while not always lasting, are\r\ndesirable in the apple business of inspecting packages. In filling the\r\nbarrel care must be taken to gently settle the apples into place by\r\nshaking the barrel from time to time as it is filled. After the bottom\r\nis faced off the corrugated cap is placed on the apples, with the smooth\r\nside next to the apples, and the head pressed into place. It is well to\r\nuse headliners to secure the heads and not trust to the use of nails\r\nalone. Have some regard for the man who has to open these heads in\r\nstorage or the salesroom. Try a few yourself if you never have, and you\r\nwill use headliners for him who comes after if for no other reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: How do you get rid of the waste apples that would rot in\r\nthe orchard?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: We have a large vinegar plant, and we convert the cider into\r\nvinegar and sell it as cider vinegar. We have sometimes shipped the\r\nfresh product of the cider mill to factories, where it is made into\r\nvinegar. Then there are evaporators for evaporating them. Take a certain\r\ngrade of apples not good to grind up into cider, and they evaporate this\r\ngrade of apples. Then there are canning factories that also take them.\r\nThe cider mill is a very good way to work up your culls and then sell as\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nA Member: What do these apple graders cost?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: From $75.00 to $125.00. The price usually depends upon the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you use clear cider for vinegar?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I use clear cider for making vinegar, and if it is too\r\nstrong to meet the requirements of the law we dilute it when we sell it.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask if you have any difficulty in getting your\r\ncider vinegar up to the requirements of the law?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: We do not have any trouble about that, except that made from\r\nsummer apples. Any cider that will grade 18 or 24 with the saccharimeter\r\nin the fall of the year, when it is made, will make good vinegar.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you pack all one-size of apples in a barrel?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: No.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you use very nearly the same size apples in a barrel, or do\r\nyou put large ones at the top and bottom?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I have heard of growers doing that, but the only way to pack\r\na barrel honestly is to select your facers--the law permits that they\r\nmay have 20 per cent. advantage of the rest of the barrel. The rest of\r\nthe barrel ought to be graded uniformly throughout. I don't mean by that\r\nthey should all be apples of three or four inches diameter, but that\r\nthey run above a certain figure with a minimum of 2-1/4 or 2-1/2,\r\ndepending upon the variety you are packing. In running them over\r\ngraders, which sizes them, all over that size go over the apron and into\r\nthe barrel.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you face both ends of the barrel?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Yes, sir, we do. We do not undertake to select for the\r\nbottom or tail of the barrel apples as to size or color, but we do\r\nthis--we lay those apples around in concentric rings and turn the color\r\nside or best looking side of the apple up and as nearly level as may be\r\nacross the top and just the right height, so that when they are pressed\r\ninto the barrel the barrel will be tight enough so as not to have the\r\napples loose, and yet not have them bruised in the heading. It takes\r\npractice to do that just at the right height.\r\n\r\nThe barrel should be shaken as it is being filled. If you do not shake\r\noften when being filled and settle the apples down so they reach the\r\nplace where they belong, no matter how tight you make your barrel, when\r\nit gets into the car and on the train and in motion that constant\r\nshaking and jar will loosen the apples, and you will have a slack\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\nA Member: What sort of apples go to the canneries?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: That, of course, depends upon the season. If the season is\r\nsuch that the No. 2 apples are not worth any great amount of money, they\r\nwill buy everything except cull stock below the strictly No. 1 apple and\r\nuse them in the canning factory. If the price is high they will probably\r\ntake the drops, those dropped in picking, or good sound drops. We\r\nusually make a practice of cleaning up our drops once a week off the\r\nground in picking time. Before we begin picking we clean the ground\r\nentirely and run that through the vinegar factory, into the cider mill,\r\nand after that is done any apples that drop in picking they are disposed\r\nof in various ways, sometimes to the evaporator, sometimes to the\r\ncanning factory and sometimes they are shipped in bulk if they are good\r\nsound apples and not injured in any way except perhaps for a few\r\nbruises.\r\n\r\nA Member: In debating the question of the grower and the cannery we are\r\nanxious to know just how far it is practical to use apples--what apples\r\nwe can use after grading them, say, for instance, into Nos. 1 and 2? Can\r\nwe use a deformed apple? For instance, do the canners in your country\r\nbuy deformed apples--I mean lacking in roundness?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: They can use them; they are a little more expensive to\r\nhandle when you put them on the fork to peel them. Of course, they have\r\nto use the knife on them afterwards in those places where they are not\r\nperfect, cutting out any imperfect spots on them. But as a rule they\r\nrequire pretty fair quality of apple for cannery and above a certain\r\nsize. They wouldn't want to use anything less than two inches in\r\ndiameter, and from that on, and they get as good apples as they possibly\r\ncan. They have to limit themselves as to prices according to how much\r\nthey can get for their product.\r\n\r\nA Member: What grader do you recommend?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Well, I don't think that I care to advertise any grader. I\r\nam not interested in any.\r\n\r\nA Member: You are a long way from home, and it might enlighten the rest\r\nof us.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: There are several graders on the market, and for all I know,\r\ngiving good service. I am using the Trescott, made in New York.\r\n\r\nA Member: What is the matter with the Hardy?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I never used the Hardy--I don't know about that. Some of\r\nthem will bruise the apples more than others.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: What form of packing for apples will bring the best prices?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I investigated that. I have packed as high as a couple of\r\nthousand boxes of apples, and I have taken the very best I had and\r\nbarreled. I picked out the extra selects and boxed them. Then I took a\r\nNo. 1 grade from those that that were left and the No. 2 grade, and my\r\nNo. 1 grade in barrels were disposed of before I could sell my boxes at\r\nall in the market. The boxes were the last thing I could dispose of.\r\nConsidering the extra cost of boxing I was out of pocket in selling them\r\nin boxes. Bushel baskets are all right, you can pack the basket with no\r\nmore expense than packing a barrel.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: What can a cannery afford to pay for apples?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I have never been in the cannery business, I could not tell.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: They are talking of starting a cannery where I live and I\r\nwondered what they can afford to pay.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Some five or six years ago I sold a number of hundred\r\nbushels to canneries at 60 cents per hundred pounds. Whether they can\r\nafford to pay that or not I don't know. I haven't sold any to them for\r\nseveral years now. In fact, I should judge they couldn't afford to pay\r\nthat for them because they went out of business.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: In other words, they can't pay over 35 or 30 cents a\r\nbushel?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I don't know what they can afford to pay.\r\n\r\nA Member: We had a canning factory that paid 40 cents a bushel of 50\r\npounds, that would be 80 cents a hundred.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Are they still in business?\r\n\r\nA Member: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: We had one that paid 52 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: If they were to can these apples in Illinois and ship them\r\nup here they have got to pay freight to come in competition with your\r\napples.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: I sprayed last spring first with lime-sulphur, and my\r\nsprayer worked fine. I had a hand sprayer, but when I mixed the\r\nlime-sulphur and the arsenate of lead it almost stopped up. What was the\r\nmatter, was it the mixture or the sprayer?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Most all of these mixtures when you put them together ought\r\nto be more or less diluted.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: How long must they stand dissolved?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: The lime-sulphur is in solution, and if you have that in\r\nyour water tank the best way is to put your arsenate of lead in in the\r\nform of a paste and dilute it until you get it so that there is about\r\ntwo pounds of arsenate of lead to a gallon of water, and with that you\r\ncan pour it into your tank and if you have an agitator in there you\r\nwon't have any difficulty with it. In the early days of spraying when we\r\nused blue vitriol with lime, we tried a concentrated solution of the\r\nblue vitriol and lime and found we couldn't get it through the strainer,\r\nbut by diluting it, putting our blue vitriol in one tank, and putting\r\nhalf of our water that we intended putting in the sprayer in that, and\r\ntaking another tank and putting half the water and the lime in that and\r\nthen putting the two together in this diluted solution, we didn't have\r\nany trouble, but in putting in the concentrated solutions together we\r\nhad a sticky mess and all sorts of trouble. It would not go through the\r\nstrainer.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: How does the powdered arsenate compare with the paste?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I haven't had any personal experience with the powder and I\r\nwould have to refer you to the experiment station.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: Powder mixes a great deal easier.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: Yes, sir. I had this experience with hydrated lime. The\r\nhydrated lime, as you know, comes in sacks and in the form of flour, and\r\nall you have to do is just to pour that into the water, and there is no\r\ntrouble about mixing it at all. With lime from barrels that we used for\r\nmaking bordeaux, we would slake it and run it off into barrels, and\r\nthere we diluted it so that we got two pounds to every gallon of water,\r\nour stock solution. But with the hydrated lime we can take so much out,\r\nso much by weight, and put it into the tank, and it dissolves right in\r\nthe water. But we found this difficulty as between slaked lime and the\r\nhydrated lime. While the hydrated is very nice to use it did not possess\r\nthe adhesive quality that the regular slaked lime did, and it would wash\r\noff the trees and take the vitriol solution with it, and we discontinued\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauter: You think it best for anybody with a small orchard to make\r\nhis own lime-sulphur solution?\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: That depends on how he is equipped. It costs a great deal\r\nless to make your own solution than it does to buy it. Whether you could\r\nafford to do it or not depends upon the amount you spray and your\r\nequipment. You really ought to have, in making your own lime-sulphur, a\r\nsteam boiler, although you can make it in an ordinary farm feed boiler.\r\nYou can boil it right in that and turn it out after it is made, stirring\r\nit with a wooden paddle while cooking. I find that if we are equipped\r\nfor it we will make a product that is equal to the imported product, but\r\nwe ought to have a little more equipment. We ought to have steam and run\r\nthis steam into our cooking vat to keep it boiling at the right\r\ntemperature right along, and boil it for an hour, and then have a\r\nmechanical agitator in the bottom of the tub that keeps it stirred up,\r\nand keep the cover closed down as nearly tight as possible so as to\r\nexclude the air as much as possible, letting the surplus steam escape,\r\nand in that way we get a product as good as anything we are able to buy,\r\nat less than half the price. If one is using a great quantity that is\r\nthe way to do it, but in small quantities I don't think it would pay to\r\nbother with it.

PAUL.\r\n\r\n(Gideon Memorial Contest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMankato has a population of about twelve thousand and is just about\r\nwithin the car-lot market. In seasons of low production it can easily\r\nuse all the fruit grown in the vicinity, but in seasons of good\r\nproduction some must be shipped out. This irregular supply makes it\r\ndifficult to obtain a satisfactory method of marketing the fruit.\r\n\r\nNearly all kinds of fruit are grown here. Apples, strawberries and\r\nraspberries are grown to the greatest extent. There are several orchards\r\nhaving from five hundred to a thousand trees, while many small fruit\r\ngrowers have several acres of strawberries and raspberries. Plums,\r\nblackberries, currants and gooseberries are grown on a smaller scale, so\r\nthat there is seldom enough produced to make it necessary to ship them.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties grown is very great, as it is in almost every\r\nlocality where the industry is relatively young. There are over forty\r\nvarieties of apples grown on a more or less large scale. This makes the\r\nmarketing problem still more difficult. Many of the growers are\r\nbeginning to specialize in two or three varieties, such as Wealthy,\r\nPatten, Northwestern and Malinda. Last year some of the growers produced\r\nas many as five carloads. Small fruits are brought in by the wagon load\r\nduring the heaviest part of the season, making it possible for the fruit\r\nhouses to load a car in a day.\r\n\r\nThe commercial growers use good, practical methods of culture, keeping\r\nthe land well cultivated and using cover crops and mulch; but many of\r\nthe small growers of half-way fruit men--those who do not specialize in\r\nfruit growing--neglect their orchards. Most growers properly prune and\r\nthin their trees and bushes, while many are beginning to spray.\r\n\r\nIn the picking, grading and packing of the fruit is where the great\r\nmajority fail. After they have grown the fruit carefully and\r\nsuccessfully, they fail to properly harvest and dispose of it. This\r\nfault lies in the fact that they have specialized in the production of\r\ntheir product and have given little time or attention to the marketing\r\nof it. They realize, though, that success in fruit growing depends as\r\nlargely upon proper marketing as upon proper growing.\r\n\r\nThe first step in marketing is the picking of the fruit. Fruit, as any\r\nother product, should be picked at a certain time; and the grower who\r\nallows his fruit to remain on the tree or bush too long, as is often\r\ndone with the apple, until his work is caught up, is the grower who\r\nreceives unsatisfactory prices for his product. Many farmers bring\r\nwindfalls and bruised apples mixed with the hand picked ones and expect\r\nas much as the grower who carefully picks his apples. The picking\r\nutensils are also often a cause of injury. Tin pails, wooden buckets and\r\nboxes are used to too great an extent. These naturally bruise more or\r\nless of the apples as they are put into the pails, especially if extreme\r\ncare is not used. The pouring of the fruit from one receptacle into\r\nanother is still another source of injury.\r\n\r\nThe small fruit grower usually handles his fruit with greater care than\r\nthe apple grower does, for the simple reason that improper handling of\r\nthese fruits soon shows itself, and the grower may find that he is\r\nunable to dispose of his fruit. The most common cause of injury to small\r\nfruit is over-ripeness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. L. Keene.]\r\n\r\nThe improper sorting and grading of fruit is another cause of\r\nunprofitable returns. All bruised, wormy or injured apples should be\r\ndiscarded at picking time. The presence of only a few inferior fruits in\r\na lot will bring the price down considerably. The same holds true with\r\nberries, and is even more important, for if one berry rots it soon\r\nspreads disease to the other berries. For this reason the sorting out of\r\nall inferior fruit is essential, even more so than grading.\r\n\r\nThe grading aids in getting better prices but is not necessary for\r\nprofitable results. If small fruit is well sorted, the growers claim\r\nthat it is not necessary to grade it, for the fruit will then be fairly\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nWith apples, grading is distinctly beneficial. Many marketable apples\r\nmay be blemished so that their appearance is hurt, while their keeping\r\nand shipping qualities are but slightly injured. The best grade must\r\ncontain apples uniform in size, shape and color, and free from all\r\nblemishes. Hence it is readily seen why at least two grades are\r\nessential. The growers at Mankato do not grade their apples to more than\r\none grade and this amounts only to sorting. The best of the commercial\r\napple growers carefully sort out the small and injured fruits, but a\r\nlarge portion of the growers even neglect this to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe method of packing the fruit is very variable, and in fact a large\r\npart of it is not packed at all. Most of the small fruit growers use the\r\nsixteen quart crate, while the apple, if it is packed at all, is packed\r\nin barrels. One requirement of a package is that it be clean, and if it\r\nmust be clean a secondhand package cannot be used. Many fall down here\r\nby using secondhand, odd sized and dirty crates or barrels. The shipping\r\ncrate should be kept out of the field and off of the ground. The place\r\nfor it is in the packing house.\r\n\r\nThe apple growers often take their barrels into the field to fill them\r\nand thus more or less soil them. This is not done to any great extent at\r\nMankato, for most of the barrel packing is done at the fruit houses, the\r\ngrowers bringing in the apples loose in a wagonbox. This is a good\r\nsystem as the apples are only handled three times: from the tree to the\r\npicking basket, from the picking basket to the wagonbox, and from here\r\ninto barrels. By this method the apples are sorted both at the picking\r\nand barreling time. If the apples are to be graded or packed at the\r\nfarm, a packing house should be provided at or near the orchard.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to speak of the slack and inefficient method of marketing\r\napples in sacks, salt barrels and odd boxes; but this is still done by\r\nsome half-way growers. They often have to either take the fruit back and\r\nfeed it to the pigs or give it away. Even when they are able to sell it,\r\nthey barely cover expense of picking and marketing.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of selling their fruit are available to the growers\r\naround Mankato. The different methods used are (1) selling direct to\r\nconsumer, (2) selling to stores, (3) selling to wholesale houses, (4)\r\nselling to commission men.\r\n\r\nThe amount handled in the \"direct to the consumer\" way is rather large\r\nin the case of small fruit, but there is very little so-called \"apple\r\npeddling\" done. Some growers have regular customers whom they supply\r\nyearly with a barrel or more of apples, but this is usually some friend\r\nor relative. Some growers peddle out their summer apples by driving\r\nthrough the residence sections of the city and selling to anyone who\r\nwants to buy and in such quantities as they desire, but not all growers\r\ncare to follow this plan. Sales are always made for cash, except perhaps\r\nwhere a person is a regular customer. This method is too unsatisfactory\r\nto be used for winter apples but is often advantageous in disposing of a\r\nlarge crop of summer apples. The fruit is not usually in very good\r\nshape, and is often that which the fruit dealers have rejected. The\r\nfruit is marketed in any package that happens to be handy, or loose, in\r\nthe box, and is measured out usually in small quantities to the buyer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A load of apples from P.L. Keene's orchard, near Mankato]\r\n\r\nThe handling of berries direct to consumer is much more systematized and\r\ntherefore proves more satisfactory to both parties concerned. The\r\nmajority of growers sell a considerable quantity in this way. They pack\r\nin sixteen quart crates, and usually will not divide a crate. The\r\nberries are for the most part delivered on order of the customer, for\r\ncash. Each grower has his regular customers, and some advertise to a\r\nlimited extent. This method is usually satisfactory to the grower for he\r\nsells at a fixed price, and over that which he could get at the stores.\r\nHe finds that it pays him to furnish good berries, for if he delivers a\r\npoor crate the lady receiving that crate is sure to make it known to her\r\nneighbors, while a good crate will add to his reputation. Therefore, the\r\ngrower will take particular pains to have the boxes well filled with\r\ngood berries and delivered promptly, in order to hold this trade. In\r\ncompensation he receives a good price, regular customers and a sure\r\nmarket for his product.\r\n\r\nThe amount handled through the stores is about equal to that handled\r\ndirect to the consumer, but in some seasons it is not as great. The\r\ngrower demands cash, for he can get it at the other places, while most\r\nof the stores prefer cash rather than a trade basis, on account of the\r\nbother of handling the trade checks. Some stores, by offering a higher\r\ntrade price, try to draw trade, but this does not attract the commercial\r\ngrower. It may, however, attract the half-way grower. Most stores do not\r\ntry to handle more than they can dispose of themselves. It is the small\r\ngrower who sells to the stores. The large grower cannot get the prices\r\nthat will pay him to bother with the store trade, while the fruit houses\r\ndo not want to handle the small fruit grower's product, for it is\r\nusually of inferior quality. Hence, the store trade is a necessity under\r\npresent conditions, even though it is not a very satisfactory method.\r\n\r\nThe apples are brought to the stores in the same packages as to the\r\nconsumer direct. The berries are handled in the same packages, but the\r\ncondition and quality are more apt to be inferior than with those sold\r\nto the consumer. The stores usually re-sort the fruit before they sell\r\nit. They very seldom ship fruit. In case they get more on their hands\r\nthan they can sell, they either store it for a few days, or sell to the\r\nwholesale fruit houses.\r\n\r\nThere is more fruit handled by either one of the two wholesale fruit\r\nhouses than by any other single way in Mankato. They handle the bulk of\r\nthe apple crop grown commercially but will not take inferior fruit. The\r\nsmall fruit growers market a considerable portion of their crops through\r\nthem, especially in years when they have more than they can dispose of\r\nto consumers. The wholesale houses offer no fixed price, except it be in\r\na contract with some individual grower whom they know will bring in good\r\nfruit. When a load comes in they look it over and bid on it. If the\r\ngrower is satisfied with the price, he sells, and if not he tries the\r\nother house or the stores.\r\n\r\nThe commercial growers usually bring in their apples loose in the\r\nwagon-box, and the apples are packed into barrels here. This insures a\r\nclean barrel, properly packed. It enables the buyer to look over the\r\nload as it is being unloaded. One or two growers have a reputation good\r\nenough that the houses will buy their fruit barreled. All small fruits\r\nare handled in the sixteen quart crates and are not repacked. The\r\ngrower delivers them as up to grade on his reputation, which will not\r\nlast long if he does not furnish good berries. The grower usually tells\r\nthe wholesaler when they were picked and the condition they are in. They\r\ndo a cash business only.\r\n\r\nVery little has been handled through the commission men of other cities.\r\nA few carloads have been shipped to Minneapolis, but returns were not as\r\nsatisfactory as when sold to the wholesale houses. In shipping the\r\ngrower has to take more risk and do more work, such as packing and\r\nloading the car, than when he sells to the wholesaler. Most growers\r\nprefer to sell to the houses than to do this extra work, which they are\r\nneither used to, nor capable of handling. Besides this, most growers do\r\nnot have enough fruit at any one time to load a car.\r\n\r\nThere is no co-operative association at the present time, but the\r\ngrowers were trying to organize one last winter. In a certain way there\r\nis an agreement among the small fruit growers, in that nearly all of\r\nthem agree to market their fruit in the sixteen quart crate and stick to\r\ncertain prices as far as possible, and not to cut prices under other\r\ngrowers. This applies especially to the \"direct to the consumer\" trade.\r\nThere are no street venders to whom the growers can sell nor with whom\r\nthey would have to compete, and there is no city market at Mankato.\r\n\r\nStorage conditions have not been developed. The wholesale houses have\r\nsmall storage rooms of their own, but do little storing of home grown\r\nproducts, as they ship them out as soon as they get a carload. The\r\nstores store a few days in case they get an over-supply on hand. The\r\ngrowers store apples in their own cellars, often keeping them until the\r\nfollowing spring. A few city people buy apples in the fall and store for\r\nwinter use, but it is not very satisfactory for the storage houses do\r\nnot regulate the temperature accurately enough.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRUNING OF CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES.--The main reason that\r\ncurrant and gooseberry bushes do not yield satisfactory crops from year\r\nto year is due to the lack of proper pruning.\r\n\r\nBoth currants and gooseberries produce their fruit on canes that are at\r\nleast two years old, the first season being generally utilized for the\r\ngrowing of the canes, the second for the formation of fruit buds or\r\nspurs, and the third a full crop may be expected. These canes will bear\r\nfor two and even three years, but each year after the third they begin\r\nto show a decided decline--the fruit becomes smaller and less valuable.\r\nIn order to keep the production up to the standard, the bush should be\r\nplaced on the rotation basis, that is, each year a few new, strong\r\nshoots should be permitted to grow. All the rest should be cut out, and\r\nalso each spring a like number of the oldest canes should be removed. In\r\nother words, we should grow the same number of new canes that we take\r\nout in old canes. In this way, we eliminate the old and exhausted canes\r\nand keep the bushes in strong, vigorous growth. Further, as the season\r\nprogresses, all shoots beyond those that we wish to use for fruiting\r\nlater on should be removed and not permitted to utilize the food supply\r\nthat should go to the fruiting canes.--E.P. Sandsten, Col. Agri.\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for an Overloaded Fruit Tree.\r\n\r\nMISS NELLIE B. PENDERGAST, DULUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago the writer wearied of the many objectionable features\r\nconnected with propping overloaded apple trees, and found relief in a\r\nnew application of the maxim of modern charity--\"help people to help\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe average apple tree is quite capable of supporting its load of fruit,\r\nwith a little assistance in applying its strength. This is\r\nsatisfactorily given by overhead supports. My method is as follows:\r\n\r\nTake a piece of gas pipe, the diameter depending on the size of the tree\r\nand consequent weight of the load, and long enough to extend some two or\r\nthree feet above the tree. The required height would be governed by the\r\nspread of the branches and the distance between the trunk of the tree\r\nand the proper point for support of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe pipe is placed against the trunk of the tree, pushed a few inches\r\ninto the ground, and tied in several places tightly to the tree. On the\r\ntop (which must be screw-threaded) is screwed an ordinary gas pipe end.\r\nHeavy cords are then run through holes in the top piece and tied to the\r\nbranches wherever needed--the same cord often being made to tie several\r\nbranches which are in line perpendicularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of apple tree with fruit laden branches supported by\r\npipe or wire.]\r\n\r\nThe branches should be wrapped with a bit of burlap or other suitable\r\npadding under the cord, as otherwise the friction resulting from the\r\ninevitable swaying of the heavy limbs on windy days would result in\r\nrubbing the bark off and possibly entirely girdling the branch. Pads\r\nshould also be placed between the gas pipe and the tree trunk wherever\r\nthere is contact, and under the rope where tied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Frisky is Telling the Veteran Horticulturist.\r\n\r\nCHAS. F. GARDNER, OSAGE, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am your cunning little squirrel, and as you have named me Frisky and\r\nhave adopted me as a regular member of your family, I will tell you some\r\nlittle things I know about horticulture, or more properly, forest tree\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our squirrel.]\r\n\r\nMy ancestors from way back through geological ages have all been lovers\r\nof nut trees and especially conifers. If you knew of the great districts\r\ncovered with valuable timber that have come into existence by reason of\r\nour planting of nuts and conifer seed, you would be very much surprised.\r\nWhile we gather large quantities of seed for use as food during the\r\nlong, cold winter months, each one of us secretes several thousand seed\r\nannually, widely scattered, in good places for trees to grow. The most\r\nof these scattered seeds remain in the ground and germinate where they\r\nwere planted.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather on my mother's side has told me that some of his\r\nrelatives in Scotland were once accused of doing considerable injury to\r\nplantations of firs and pines by gnawing off the top shoots, which you\r\nknow make pretty good eating for a hungry little squirrel. Wasn't that a\r\ngreat thing to make a fuss about? I believe my grandpa knew as much as\r\nyou do about the real existence and natural history of the mastodon,\r\nthe megatherium, the paleotherium and the pterodactyl.\r\n\r\nIn the planting of forest trees we were assisted by birds. I will name a\r\nfew who helped us the most in this northern latitude, or, as you call\r\nit, \"the blizzard belt.\" You showed me the other day two beautiful oak\r\ntrees, on your grounds that were planted by crows. Bluejays are great\r\nseed planters, also mourning doves; and the wild pigeons, now extinct,\r\nwere great planters of many nut trees. Almost every variety of birds has\r\nassisted us in the planting of the seeds of trees, bushes and, in fact,\r\nall plants that bear valuable fruits or nutritious seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chas. F. Gardner at his best.]\r\n\r\nWhile I think of it, I will tell you that I was born in a beautiful\r\nnest, made of moss, twigs and dry leaves curiously interwoven in the\r\nfork of a tree at a considerable height from the ground. I had four\r\nlittle brothers and sisters. We loved each other dearly and had a good\r\ntime all cuddled up in our sweet little home. I wish you would let me go\r\nand visit them sometime this summer. Now if you have no objection I will\r\ntake a little nap.--Frisky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop-Working.\r\n\r\nO. W. MOORE, VETERAN HORTICULTURIST, SPRING VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my experience in fruit growing I have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe best method to apply in starting a commercial orchard in this\r\nsection of country would be to gather apple seed from Duchess and\r\nHibernal apples and plant them, in order that we might grow hardy\r\nseedling roots to be used in making root-grafts. After growing these\r\napple seedlings one year I would graft short pieces of their roots to\r\nlong Hibernal scions, plant them out in the nursery row and grow them\r\nthe first year as a whip or single shoot. The second year before growth\r\nstarts in the spring I would cut those whips back to the height where I\r\nwanted to start the head of the tree. After growth starts rub off all\r\nthe buds except from four to six at the top, these being left to form\r\nthe head of the tree. The trunk of the tree below these buds should be\r\nkept clear of all growth at all times.\r\n\r\nBy this method we get uniform trees, as the heads, or tops, are all of\r\nan equal distance from the ground and all run very nearly the same size.\r\nNow we have those trees two years old in the nursery row, and as a\r\nfoundation for hardiness we have done our best. We have taken seed from\r\nour hardiest apples to grow our seedling roots; we have grafted Hibernal\r\nscions onto those roots, which is supposed to be the hardiest apple wood\r\nthat we have. Still there is one point that has not been touched upon,\r\nand that is, that it is not to be supposed that all of those seedling\r\nroots from the seed of our hardiest apples will be hardy. You may ask\r\nwhy? Well, because mother nature does not do business that way. We hear\r\nnow and then the remark, \"He is a good mixer.\" Well, if any man or set\r\nof men can beat mother nature at mixing they will have to do better in\r\nthe future than they have done in the past.\r\n\r\nBut remember that we have the Hibernal as a scion above those roots, and\r\nthat is the best apple wood to root from the scion that I know of. Some\r\nmay ask, why not use the Virginia crab? I answer, for the reasons above\r\nstated, as I have tried both.\r\n\r\nOur trees are two years old now and are ready to be planted in the\r\norchard where they are to remain. Grow them in orchards one year. But if\r\nfrom drouth or some other cause they do not make a satisfactory growth,\r\ngrow them two years. Then top-work their four or six limbs about six\r\ninches from their forks to any kind of apple that you wish to produce in\r\na commercial way--but leave all small growth below those unions the\r\nfirst year. The second year cut everything away but the scions.\r\n\r\nIf the planter will follow the above methods I am willing to stake my\r\nreputation as a fruit grower that he will have an orchard that will stay\r\nwith him and give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nVery many apple trees, especially seedlings, when they come to bearing\r\nage are found to be worthless or nearly so. If those trees are taken in\r\nhand at any time under ten years old they can be readily top-worked to\r\nsome good apple and completely changed in two years' time. The first\r\nyear work center limbs or leaders, leaving the lower growth to be worked\r\nthe second year. The third year by cutting everything away but the\r\ngrowth of the scions we have the tree changed over to a better variety\r\nof fruit. As to the size of limbs to graft I have always made it a point\r\nto never work limbs over one inch in diameter. But from one inch down to\r\nwhip-grafting size, limbs from three-quarters to one inch, we set two\r\nscions. The wound heals sooner with two scions than with one. If there\r\nis too much growth in a year or two, cut a part of it away just above\r\nthe union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvergreens.\r\n\r\nJENS A. JENSEN, ROSE CREEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy not grow evergreens in the place of willows? When I came to Mower\r\nCounty if there were any trees planted they were willows, a few Lombardy\r\npoplars and Balm of Gilead.\r\n\r\nSince 1890 there has been a great deal of planting of evergreens,\r\nespecially around Austin and Rose Creek.\r\n\r\nSome people think it hard to grow evergreens. One mistake they make is\r\nin planting too large trees. Another is in planting them in June grass\r\nsod, a sod that will not wet down one inch in a rain that lasts\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nEvergreens should be planted in cultivated land, and then they will grow\r\nsurprisingly fast. Plant trees from one to two feet. If wanted for a\r\nwindbreak, plant eight feet apart; if two rows are wanted, plant trees\r\nsixteen feet apart, in rows four feet apart, the trees planted\r\nalternately. Norway, White and Black Hills spruce, also White, Scotch\r\nand Jack pine are doing well here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM--EZRA F. PABODY\r\n\r\n\r\nEZRA F. PABODY was born in Vernon, Indiana, July 26th, 1838. His\r\nfather's name was Ezra F. Pabody, and his mother's maiden name was Mabel\r\nButler. Comrade Pabody was married in Oxford, Ohio, October 10th, 1866,\r\nto Emma A. Brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait of the late Ezra F. Pabody, from a photograph\r\ntaken ten years ago.]\r\n\r\nHis education was acquired by attending, first, the common schools at\r\nVernon, Indiana, until he was sixteen years of age; and in September,\r\n1854, he entered Hanover College, where he spent five years. In 1859, he\r\nentered Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and graduated from that\r\nUniversity in June, 1860. In September of that same year he entered\r\nPrinceton Theological Seminary, where he studied for one year with a\r\nview to entering the ministry, but the condition of his health\r\ninterfered with his carrying out this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, having come to Minnesota, and as volunteers were being enlisted\r\nto crush the rebellion, which threatened our country with destruction,\r\nhis spirit of patriotism impelled him to offer his services to aid in\r\nmaintaining the government. Accordingly he enlisted at Fort Snelling,\r\nSeptember 25th, 1861, and was enrolled in Company \"A,\" Third Minnesota\r\nVolunteers. In November of that year he was appointed Hospital Steward\r\nof the Regiment, but he was unable long to endure the activities of the\r\nservice, and on July 9th, 1862, was discharged on account of\r\ndisability. However, his loyal spirit would not allow him to rest if\r\nthere was a place where he might serve effectively, and accordingly, on\r\nAugust 24th, 1862, he enlisted again,--this time in the 79th Indiana\r\nVolunteer Infantry, and was assigned to duty as Hospital Steward, in\r\nwhich office he continued until discharged for disability December 18th,\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nAfter his army service, he engaged in the drug business at Vernon,\r\nIndiana. In 1875 he removed to Minneapolis and here followed the same\r\nline of business until 1888.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1890, he was prevailed upon to take up City Mission work in\r\nconnection with Westminster Church, and was ordained to the Gospel\r\nministry in 1900.\r\n\r\nRetiring from the active work of the ministry in 1903, he passed the\r\nremaining years of his life in his quiet home at Zumbra Heights, Lake\r\nMinnetonka, where the death angel found him September 21st, 1915, after\r\na long period of illness.\r\n\r\nHis memory will be lastingly perpetuated by the development of his city\r\nmission work, known as \"Riverside Mission,\" a neglected portion of\r\nMinneapolis, embracing what is known as \"The River Flats,\" where the\r\ninhabitants, mostly foreigners, and in need of religious instruction,\r\nwere taught by this faithful missionary and his estimable and\r\nconsecrated wife to speak and sing the language of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe faithful wife and co-laborer, one son, E. Fitch Pabody, and one\r\ndaughter, Eleanor (Mrs. Ward H. Benton), all of Minneapolis, survive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Pabody is, of course, best known to the members of this society on\r\naccount of his service with it in the past thirteen years. While not one\r\nof the oldest members of the society from a point of years in his\r\nconnection with the society, in point of service he ranks very high, for\r\nduring all the period of his service he was always finding something to\r\ndo for the association. Several times he was on the program, in a number\r\nof official capacities he served the society, and especially as a member\r\nof the reception committee during a number of our annual meetings was he\r\nof largest use to the association, and his courteous and kindly ways we\r\nespecially remember. Mr. Pabody was very near to the writer personally,\r\nand his taking away is largely in the nature of a personal loss. Mr.\r\nPabody had a great love for horticultural pursuits. His garden and\r\norchard occupied very much of his thoughts during the later years of his\r\nlife, when he lived on the shores of Lake Minnetonka. It is hard to part\r\nwith these old members who have so much endeared themselves to us in\r\nthese many thoughtful ways.--Secy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread Cast upon the Waters.\r\n\r\nC. S. HARRISON, YORK, NEB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instance recited below has nothing particularly to do with\r\nhorticulture but a good deal to do with a \"horticulturist,\" C. S.\r\nHarrison, of York, Neb., that picturesque veteran in horticulture, who\r\nhas been an attendant at our meetings now for so many years, adding such\r\na strong interest to our annual gatherings. Mr. Harrison recited at our\r\nlate meeting the incident referred to here--without the denouement,\r\nwhich came to him in California this winter, where he met Mr. Lindbergh,\r\none of Minnesota congressmen. As a result of this incident we had Mr.\r\nHarrison with again at our late summer meeting.--Secy.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 I was living in Sauk Center, Minn., where I preached the first\r\nsermon. I had a tract of country under my care 100 miles in extent and\r\nhad all sorts of work to do. Ten miles from Sauk Center there was a\r\nsturdy Swede who was at one time speaker in one branch of the Swedish\r\nparliament and for a while secretary to the king. He moved to Minnesota\r\nabout the year '60. It seems he had not learned the art of graft, and he\r\nwas poor. He took up a preemption and built him a little log house\r\n12×16. One day he took a load of logs to the mill and, stumbling, fell\r\non the saw. This caught him in the back and split it open, and also took\r\na stab at his right arm.\r\n\r\nIt was hot weather and no surgeon within fifty miles. I followed him to\r\nhis home; we did not think he could live. I picked out the sawdust and\r\nrags from his back and kept the wounded arm wrapped in cold water, and\r\nnow for a surgeon I got a horse from a neighbor and a man to ride him. I\r\nsaid, \"Don't hurt the horse but go as fast as it is safe.\" Twenty miles\r\nahead I knew another man with whom he could exchange horses, and then\r\nanother relay brought him to the doctor. Dr. Hunter proved to be a good\r\nsurgeon. We had kept the patient with such care that with his clean\r\nhabits and robust constitution he underwent the operation all right. I\r\nhelped the doctor, and we took off the arm near the shoulder. I had a\r\nbusy time until the surgeon came. I stayed with the man all day, then\r\ndrove home ten miles and was by his side early. It took the doctor about\r\nthree days to get there. The horses were poor, and the auto did not\r\nexist even in a dream. By the next December the old hero was out\r\nchopping rails with his left hand.\r\n\r\nHow poor the people were! Every dollar had a big task before it. The\r\ngood doctor only charged $20. I rode quite a distance--got a little here\r\nand there and paid the bill. A son of the old man, C. A. Lindbergh, is\r\nnow representative in congress from the 6th district of Minnesota. We\r\ndiscovered each other this winter. I have kept up a pleasant\r\ncorrespondence. His daughter, Eva, who helps her father, has just\r\nwritten me that she is going to be married in Minneapolis in June, and\r\nshe wants me to perform the ceremony. All the friends and relatives will\r\nbe there, and she wants the man who saved her grandpa. Thus, after\r\nfifty-five years, stirring memories of the past are awakened and happy\r\nanticipations of the future.--C. S. Harrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE EVERBEARING STRAWBERRIES.--Mr. Walter Ferguson, of\r\nMankato, has pretty near the record number of strawberry plants raised\r\nlast year. From four plants of No. 1017 everbearing strawberries he\r\nreports having raised several over six hundred. He says he reset twelve\r\nnew plants in July and they produced over three hundred.\r\n\r\nADVANCE PREMIUM LIST, ANNUAL MEETING, 1916.--Elsewhere in this\r\nnumber will be found an advance list of premiums to be offered on\r\nvegetables and apples at the coming annual meeting of the society. There\r\nwill be practically no change from this list, though there may be slight\r\nadditions to it. Possible exhibitors may feel safe to save material for\r\nexhibition in accordance with the premiums therein offered.\r\n\r\nPASSING OF J.F. BENJAMIN.--Members of the society who have\r\nattended our annual meetings for the last ten or more years will readily\r\nrecall the face and figure of this very loyal member of the society, who\r\nwas always at hand to serve in any capacity as opportunity came to him.\r\nMr. Benjamin was a successful fruit grower, not only from a financial\r\nstandpoint but from his love of the art. We hope to publish a suitable\r\nsketch of his life at some later date.\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL CAMPS IN NATIONAL FORESTS.--The City of Fresno,\r\nCalifornia, has established a fifteen-acre camp in an adjoining national\r\nforest, providing low cost outings for the school children of that city\r\nand their parents. Los Angeles is doing something similar on even a\r\nlarger scale, and other municipalities are following suit. Minnesota has\r\nsplendid national forests, and the time may come when the state or some\r\nof the municipalities of the state may be able to make similar use of\r\nthese forests for the benefit of our people who are not able to go to\r\nlarger expense to secure needed summer outing.\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE CROP.--The Department of Agriculture in its August\r\n1st report forecasts an apple crop of seventy-one million barrels\r\nagainst seventy-six million last year and a yearly average for the past\r\nfive years of sixty-six million. The favored regions in apple growing\r\nthis year are in the New England states and the Pacific states, the\r\nCentral states showing a very large falling off in the apple crop,\r\nanywhere from four-fifths to one-fourth of previous years.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL VEGETABLE GROWERS' ASSOCIATION.--It seems there is an\r\nassociation of this character, called \"Vegetable Growers' Association of\r\nAmerica,\" and it will hold its next annual meeting in LaSalle Hotel,\r\nChicago, September 26-29. Representatives of local vegetable growers'\r\nassociations' will probably do well to get in touch with this national\r\ngathering. If any go from this state the secretary will be glad to\r\nreceive from them a report of the meeting. Marketing, soil fertility,\r\nheating, packing, spraying and other subjects will be covered on the\r\nprogram. For further information address James B. Foley, Secretary, 3100\r\nSouth Spaulding Avenue, Chicago.\r\n\r\nAPPLE TREES AS A WINDBREAK.--John W. Maher, of Devils Lake,\r\nN.D., in correspondence has spoken at two different times of the use of\r\napple trees as one feature of windbreaks in his vicinity, using such\r\nvarieties as Duchess, Patten's Greening, Hibernal, etc. In this\r\nconnection he says \"probably it is only the amateur horticulturist who\r\nsets a row of young apple trees in the stubble fields as a windbreak for\r\napple grafts, but this has been done here and the windbreak is\r\nsatisfactory. I believe that the apple is more hardy in this kind of\r\nsoil than it is generally considered to be. If the apple tree is\r\nproperly limbed so as to shade its trunk and larger limbs it is a real\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL SOCIETY PERIODICALS.--February, 1894, the first\r\nnumber of the monthly issued by this society was published and sent out\r\nto its members. Publishing the report in this way as a monthly was an\r\nexperiment, which has proved to be a very successful one indeed, and\r\nthis method of publication has now for a long time been a permanent\r\nfeature of the work of this society. In 1894 the society had about six\r\nhundred members. The increase in the membership of the association since\r\nthat period has brought the roll to high water mark this year at 3,700.\r\nAt that time as far as we know no other horticultural society was\r\npublishing its report as a monthly. Quite a number of state societies\r\nare now doing something of this sort, though not exactly following the\r\nsame plan as the Minnesota society, our report appearing as a monthly\r\nmagazine and being bound up later with list of members, index, etc.,\r\nmaking altogether the annual report. The only association that has\r\nexactly followed our plan is the Manitoba Society. Wisconsin, Kansas,\r\nNebraska, Virginia and other associations not now recalled are sending\r\nout a monthly to their membership. Illinois and perhaps some others are\r\npublishing a quarterly. Some of the state boards of horticulture are\r\npublishing a monthly, notably the California board, and in some cases\r\nthe state boards of agriculture are doing this also. The plan\r\ninaugurated by this society is being slowly popularized and will\r\nundoubtedly continue to be made use of more and more as the study and\r\npractice of horticulture develops in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS FOR SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n_September Meeting of the Garden Flower Society_ will be held on the\r\ntwenty-first, at 2:30 p.m., at the Minneapolis Public Library.\r\n\r\n_Topics_, \"Fall Work in the Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Planting for Fall and Winter Effects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vines and Their Uses.\"\r\n\r\nHave you taken any photographs of your garden, its individual flowers,\r\nor wild flowers for our photographic contest? It is not too late yet to\r\nget good pictures. Every member is urged to enter this competition.\r\n\r\n_Plant peonies this month._ Old clumps of hardy perennials may be\r\ndivided and reset early this month. Flowering bulbs intended to be in\r\nbloom at Christmas should be potted now. Grass seed for new lawns or bad\r\nplaces in old ones can be sown this month.\r\n\r\nThe daffodil makes an early growth and should be planted this month.\r\nAfter the first killing frosts the tender roots, like cannas, gladioli,\r\nelephant's ears, and dahlias, can be lifted with a fork and spread out\r\nunder cover to dry, then stored in a cool cellar, free from frost.\r\n\r\nDo not cultivate the soil after September first.\r\n\r\nAll newly set plants should be mulched lightly.\r\n\r\nAll litter about the garden can be cleared away. Any plants that have\r\nbeen infested with insects or diseased should be burned. Leave no\r\nharbors for the eggs of insects, such as old weeds, grasses or litter of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\nSeeds of native plants which you wish to naturalize should be gathered\r\nand sowed immediately in a shaded, well drained location, where the soil\r\nhas some humus.\r\n\r\nLily-of-the-valley should be planted this month.\r\n\r\nTry planting a few sweet peas late in September or early October.\r\n\r\nImportant September blooming flowers are phlox, Japanese anemones;\r\nperennial asters, or Michaelmas daisy, so-called because they are\r\nsupposed to be at their best on Michaelmas Day, September 29th;\r\nhelleniums, helianthus, hardy chrysanthemum, pyrethrum uliginosum,\r\nboltonia.\r\n\r\nIf you have not these flowers, try and visit some garden where they are\r\nblooming in order to know what kinds to grow.\r\n\r\nPoppies for next June's blooming can be sown this month.\r\n\r\nBe prepared for the first early frosts, having ready to use some light\r\ncovering, such as cheesecloth. The garden can be prolonged from two to\r\nsix weeks by this slight protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD NOTES.\r\n\r\nConducted monthly by R. S. MACKINTOSH, Horticulturalist,\r\nExtension Division, University Farm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONFERENCE OF HORTICULTURAL EXTENSION WORKERS.\r\n\r\nA conference of the Horticultural Extension leaders of Wisconsin,\r\nKansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota was held early in\r\nAugust at the Iowa State College, at Ames. The subject of apple and\r\npotato clearing houses was the chief question discussed. The work of\r\nthis kind was started by Professor Greene in Kansas when they had the\r\nbig apple crop in 1913. Later Iowa and Minnesota undertook similar work.\r\nIt is expected that a co-operative plan will be formulated which will be\r\nof greater value than when each state works alone.\r\n\r\nThe visiting members were very glad to have President Pearson discuss\r\nco-operation as he saw it while visiting a dozen or more countries in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOne hour was spent in an automobile tour of the grounds and farms.\r\nConsiderable land from one to three miles from the main campus is now\r\nused for experimental work. One of the latest additions to the\r\nhorticultural equipment is a cold storage plant and range of\r\ngreenhouses, costing over sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL TOUR IN WESTERN IOWA AND EASTERN NEBRASKA.\r\n\r\nThe horticultural societies of Iowa and Nebraska joined in an automobile\r\ntour of the orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and truck farms August 2 to\r\n4. The first day was spent in and around Council Bluffs. Interest\r\ncentered around the large Co-operative Grape Growers' Association. A\r\ngrand picnic dinner was served by the ladies. This association has been\r\nin active operation for fifteen years. Professor Beach emphasized the\r\nvalue of the work that is being done, and especially the value of having\r\na contented lot of people in a community mutually interested in one kind\r\nof work. On the return trip a stop was made at the experimental apple\r\norchard that is conducted by the Horticultural Department of the Iowa\r\nState College. This orchard of 900 trees was leased in 1910 for ten\r\nyears to determine if an old orchard that has been unprofitable could be\r\nmade profitable. Careful records have been kept of expenses and of the\r\nsize and grade of all fruits produced under the several soil treatments.\r\nTo date six crops have been harvested from the 475 trees under\r\nexperiment. The lowest was 1,700 bushels in 1911 and the largest was\r\n6,000 bushels in 1915. It is estimated that there is about thirty per\r\ncent. of a crop on the trees this year. Demonstrations were given in\r\nspraying, dynamiting trees, treating trees affected with blister canker,\r\nand grading apples with a large grading machine.\r\n\r\nThe second day was spent in orchards near Omaha. Some excellent orchards\r\nthat have been very profitable were visited. It had been very dry in\r\nthat region, consequently the fruit was undersized.\r\n\r\nThe third day was spent in southwestern Iowa, from Hamburg to Glenwood.\r\nIt is impossible to tell about all the good things seen on this trip. We\r\nsaw all kinds of pruning, cultivated and \"sod cultivated\" orchards and,\r\nabove all, corn, corn and more corn. At Shenandoah the nurserymen and\r\nseedsmen took charge of the party and entertained all in a very\r\nhospitable manner. There were ninety at the noon banquet. In the\r\nafternoon they showed us the large nurseries and seed warehouse.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the trip we stopped at a 40-acre orchard, mostly\r\nGrimes Golden. A hailstorm had injured the fruit very much.\r\n\r\nOne of the great lessons gained from the 150-mile automobile tour was\r\nthe fact that _spraying_ is _one_ of the _most important orchard\r\noperations_. It was interesting to hear what some of the older\r\norchardists would say when they saw fruit injured by scab. It is an\r\nimportant matter with them, because it means dollars to have\r\ndisease-free fruit to market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VETERAN DOUGLAS FIR, STANDING MILES OUT FROM THE\r\nPROTECTING MOUNTAIN, EXPOSED TO ALL THE FIERCE WINDS OF THE\r\nPLAINS.]\r\n\r\n     While it is not the intention to publish anything in this\r\n     magazine that is misleading or unreliable, yet it must be\r\n     remembered that the articles published herein recite the\r\n     experience and opinions of their writers, and this fact must\r\n     always be noted in estimating their practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST\r\n\r\nVol. 44 OCTOBER, 1916 No. 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCamping on the Yellowstone Trail.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE WEDGE, NURSERYMAN, ALBERT LEA, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose that civilization is the correct thing for mortals to aspire\r\nto. As a boy, while I hated it with a bitter hatred, I accepted it as\r\ninevitable because my elders approved it and because it seemed\r\nindissolubly linked to the school, the church and the things of good\r\nrepute. As I grow older the yoke sits easier on my shoulders, but doubts\r\nhave increased as to its necessary connection with the good, the true\r\nand the beautiful. It surely kills the sweet virtue of hospitality. In\r\nmy home church lately there was a call for volunteers to entertain a\r\nvisiting delegation, and I was interested in observing how perfectly the\r\nnumber that might be accommodated in any home was in inverse ratio to\r\nthe size and furnishings of the house. High heeled shoes and hobble\r\nskirts, two-story starched collars and tile hats are fashion signs of\r\ncivilization, but I cannot see why a ring in the nose and a tattooed arm\r\nmight not have answered just as well. I am getting harder to convince\r\nthat a broad foot, shaped on the lines laid down by the Creator, is less\r\nbeautiful or desirable than the one-toe pointed shoe, decreed just now\r\nby our particular brand of culture, and today I would as lief defend the\r\ncult of the simple red man as the savagery that disgraces the lands\r\nacross the water.\r\n\r\nWhatever the merits of the matter, for one month of the year we and our\r\ntent and automobile abandon ourselves to barbarism, and live as we\r\nplease. This year we chose to spend our month on the Yellowstone Trail,\r\nthe road that leads from the Twin Cities to the Yellowstone National\r\nPark, and which is different from other roads leading in the same\r\ndirection mainly by its yellow mark, faithfully directing the traveler\r\non his way and preventing the loss of time in getting directions at\r\ndoubtful cross roads. Our party consisted of a young botanist, and his\r\nwife, my wife, myself and our small boy Alan. Our equipment consisted of\r\na tent, 7x7 ft., weighing, stakes, poles, partition and all, 16-1/2\r\nlbs.; a trunk on the running board made to hold bedding and grub box,\r\nand an oil cloth to use as a tent floor. Like the Indians we go light,\r\nand live the simple life while on the trail. We get off at six o'clock\r\nin the morning, eating our breakfast on the move as we get hungry; lunch\r\nat noon by the roadside, and camp early, seeking the most interesting\r\nspot, from the top of a butte to a pleasant river valley--and cooking\r\nthe one square meal of the day by such a brushwood fire as we are able\r\nto gather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Us\" and some others at a mountain cabin.]\r\n\r\nFor the first few days we try to provide some straw to temper the hard\r\nearth, but as the days go by, and we get used to roughing it, we sleep\r\nsoundly with nothing but a blanket and oil cloth between us and mother\r\nearth. We pin back the tent door, and with the night wind fanning our\r\nfaces, close our eyes to the stars and flickering campfire. Some who\r\nhave never camped are afraid of bugs, snakes and wild animals. We have\r\nspent our vacation month this way for twenty-five years, have camped in\r\nmost of the counties of Minnesota, and in Iowa, the Dakotas and Montana,\r\nand have never had but one unpleasant experience of the kind. That was\r\none night when we pitched our tent after dark on the bottoms below Fort\r\nSnelling, and did not know till we had laid ourselves down that a colony\r\nof ants had pre-empted the spot before us. We did not get much sleep,\r\nbut we had the comfort of feeling that they were nice, clean,\r\nself-respecting, self-defending ants. Would that our experience in\r\nhotels had been equally fortunate!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A young Douglas fir.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the western boundary of the forests of Minnesota near Glencoe\r\nand going across the prairie and plains to the mountain forests of\r\nMontana is an interesting experience. The only trees in Western\r\nMinnesota and the Dakotas are those found along the lakes and water\r\ncourses, and west of the Missouri the trees and shrubby growth, even in\r\nsuch places, becomes very scanty or entirely disappears, giving a weird\r\nappearance to one who has always associated water and trees together in\r\nhis mind. As we draw near the Montana line, trees begin to appear on the\r\ntops of the buttes and high bluffs on the distant horizon. Traveling on\r\nthe railroad I have wondered what they were. With our own private car we\r\nsatisfied our curiosity by zig-zagging our way up to a camping place\r\namong them, the first night they came in sight. Of course they were our\r\nold friends, the Ponderosa pine, whose name will always be associated\r\nwith our grand old man from Nebraska. They ought to be renamed the\r\nHarrison pine. How they endure the drouth and cold in a soil so poor\r\nthat grass withers and dies out, and how they stand erect where every\r\nother living thing bows to the bleak winds and blizzards of the\r\nprairies, is one of the mysteries of plant life. What a splendid bonfire\r\nwe made of their boughs that night, flaring as a beacon out over the\r\nocean of prairie about us!\r\n\r\nThe day before we had passed by hundreds of clumps of a beautiful blue\r\nlupine with finely cut foliage and profusion of color that rivaled any\r\nflower of its shade I have seen in cultivation. On the way home we\r\ngathered a handful of seed from which we shall hope to grow some plants\r\nat home. We tried to dig a few to transplant, but their roots seemed to\r\ngo down, down, till with my short handled shovel, I got discouraged. The\r\nherbage of the plains has learned to dig deep for water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A camp by the Red River of the North, Mrs. Wedge sitting\r\nby a giant cottonwood. Our 16 lb. tent at the right.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the Yellowstone at Big Timber and striking across the plains to\r\nthe Snowy Mountains, we found the Ponderosa pine, and soon the Flexilis\r\npine, wherever a rocky ridge is lifted above the level of the plains, so\r\nthat these trees were in sight a large share of the time, even far away\r\nfrom large rivers and groups of mountains. If a homestead anywhere in\r\nthat state is not cozily protected by bright colored evergreens it is\r\nnot because there is any difficulty in getting trees that will thrive in\r\nthat soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A young Ponderosa pine.]\r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountains are in the center of Montana, quite unsheltered from\r\nthe other ranges of the Rockies. It is the meeting place of the flora of\r\nthe mountains and the plains. I think it is the eastern limit of that\r\npeerless tree of the Rockies, the Douglas fir. I gave my impressions of\r\nthis tree to the society a year or two ago. I am still more in love with\r\nit from what I again saw last August in its native Snowy Mountains, and\r\nfrom the bright, sturdy little trees that have been growing at my home\r\nin Minnesota for two years past, giving assurance of their willingness\r\nto be transplanted to our moister air. It is the coming evergreen for\r\nthe prairies, and it will be a happy day for all who plant an evergreen\r\nwest of the natural timber when the Douglas fir has displaced the trees\r\nthat come from the cool, moist forests of Europe and the sheltered woods\r\nof our own lake regions.\r\n\r\nI think the Snowys are also about the eastern limit of the little\r\nbroad-leaved evergreen called the Oregon grape, that I believe every one\r\nin Minnesota can grow for Christmas greens. From my first acquaintance\r\nwith it I got the impression that it required shade, but this time I\r\nnoted that it was growing all over the bare ridges that radiate from the\r\nmountains, wherever it was possible for a little snow to lodge. We can\r\nsubstitute a light sprinkling of straw when snow is lacking. It\r\ncertainly does not require shade.\r\n\r\nThe Mariposa lily is a unique flower that springs up in open places and\r\nproduces a white blossom about the size and shape of the wild morning\r\nglory. It grows about a foot high and produces one or two flowers on\r\neach stalk. It must have a long period of bloom for ripe seed pods, and\r\nblooming plants were common at the same time in August.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian buffalo berry and a dwarfish birch are two mountain plants\r\nof no small ornamental value for the plains. They may not endure the\r\nmoister air near the Mississippi, but there we have already many useful\r\nnatives, like the black haw and thorn apple, that are as yet almost\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group of Douglas fir on the mountainside. Thirteen trees\r\nin a space of only two square rods. None less than two feet in\r\ndiameter.]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal charms about the great country traversed by the\r\nYellowstone Trail is its newness and freshness. Millions of acres just\r\nas the Indian, the buffalo and the coyote left them--broad stretches as\r\nfar as eye can reach without a sign of human habitation. But this is\r\nfast passing away. Out among the sage brush in land as poor and\r\ndesert-like as could well be imagined, homes are being mapped out by the\r\nthousand, and crops of grain were grown this year that rival the best\r\nyield in any of the older states. The time is close at hand when the\r\nmain highways will be built up and made so hard and smooth that two\r\nhundred and fifty miles will be made as easily as our average runs of\r\none hundred and fifty. The way will be safer and speedier, but it will\r\nlack some of the spice of adventure, and it will be harder to realize\r\nthe simple life about the camp fire that now seems to harmonize so well\r\nwith the wildness of the plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota Orchard.\r\n\r\nA QUESTION AND ANSWER EXERCISE LED BY J. P. ANDREWS, NURSERYMAN,\r\nFARIBAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: This is a very important subject. We have been talking\r\nabout it a long, long time, and we have advanced a little, ought to have\r\nadvanced quite a little more, and this exercise is along the road of\r\nimprovement in that line. Anything that is bothering us, anything that\r\nis in the way of our success with the apple orchard, ask what questions\r\nyou can, not that I can answer them all, but there are some good\r\norchardists around here that I know I can call on, in case I can not. In\r\nthis exercise the questions come first, and it is for you fellows to\r\nstart the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing we are lacking, that is winter apples. We have enough\r\nof fall apples, seems to me, so we can get along very well, but we are\r\nlooking for something a little better quality than Malinda and that will\r\nkeep somewhere near as long. All these new seedlings that have been\r\nintroduced in the past and big premiums offered, they seem to have\r\nstopped right there and we are not getting the benefit of but one or\r\ntwo. If they had been adapted to the north, as they should have been, we\r\nundoubtedly could have had several good varieties of apples that we\r\ncould recommend for planting a considerable ways north of here that are\r\ngood. As it is now we are really looking in this southern part of the\r\ncountry for keeping apples.\r\n\r\nI should think if we could get these new varieties of seedlings that are\r\nkeeping well introduced into the Fruit-Breeding Farm and let Supt.\r\nHaralson handle them under number and send them off to the north of us a\r\ngood ways, we could have them tested. Those that have exhibited these\r\nnew seedlings and got premiums for them, they ought to be a little more\r\nfree to get them in some shape so that they will be tested and we will\r\nlearn their worth. They have their premiums, they got those simply\r\nbecause they are good keepers. Well, now, that isn't anything in their\r\nfavor for Minnesota planting, not very much. Of course, good keepers,\r\nthat is a good thing, good quality is another thing, but the first thing\r\nis hardiness, and the people who have been drawing these premiums have\r\nbeen seemingly backward in getting them in shape to test. They are\r\nafraid to put them out for fear somebody might steal them, but if Mr.\r\nHaralson had the handling of them under number nobody could steal them.\r\nYou have got title to them and control them just as well as when you\r\nkeep them right on your place where they haven't a chance to show\r\nwhether they are hardy or not. There is the weak point in this seedling\r\nbusiness for Minnesota, I think.\r\n\r\nBut the apple orchards of Minnesota, if you are not all getting the good\r\nresults that you want from your orchards, if you are not all getting a\r\nfull crop, what is the reason? The last year and this year we have\r\nfailed of getting a good crop of apples or almost any crop, whereas\r\nbefore, ever since the old orchard was planted in 1878, why, we have\r\nregarded the apple crop as really a very much surer crop than almost any\r\nof the farm crops, but the last two years we have failed to get a crop.\r\n\r\nI attribute the poor crop a year ago to such an excessive crop as we had\r\nthe year before that. Two years ago everything was loaded, breaking\r\ndown, because we didn't thin them as we ought to, and we could hardly\r\nexpect very much the next year. This last year, you know we had frosts\r\nquite frequent up to about the 10th of June, I think that was the reason\r\nwe had such a failure this year. Our own orchard is on ground that is\r\nabout 225 feet above Faribault, so we have got air drainage, and we\r\nwould expect to escape frosts on that account and have as good a crop as\r\nanybody else would in that neighborhood. But that wasn't the case. We\r\ndidn't get any apples, and yet during county fair why there was quite a\r\nnice show of nice fruit that they had picked up a few here and a few\r\nthere, where really their location seems to me could not have been any\r\nbetter than ours. I don't know what the reason was, but it was very\r\npatchy, and I didn't dream we would have such a good show of fruit as we\r\ndid, and I couldn't tell where it came from.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: I think when the trees are loaded so heavily, if you would\r\npick off a third of them you would get more out of the balance of the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Yes, I think that. The question is, if we pick off a third\r\nof a heavy crop, if we have a heavy crop, if that wouldn't help the next\r\ncrop. It surely would.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Help that crop, too, in the price.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Yes, sir, it will pay that year besides paying the next\r\nyear, too; it will pay double.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: It is a good plan any year.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Yes, we ought to do that, we are lacking in that work of\r\nthinning the fruit. We sometimes have a late frost that will take off\r\npart of them, thin them that way, or wind, or something of that kind,\r\nand we rather depend on that feature of it. Then in that time of the\r\nyear we are very busy and liable to have some things neglected, and that\r\nseems to be the one that is almost always neglected.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Would you advocate the extensive planting of apples in\r\nthis climate?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I would not. At the same time you take it in the southern\r\npart of the state I presume they can grow them there. They can grow\r\nthere many things we can't think of growing in this part of the state\r\nunless it be along Lake Minnetonka.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: Where you have an orchard ten years old, is it best to seed\r\nit down or still continue to cultivate it? In the west they have to\r\ncultivate. What is the best in this country? I know one man says it is\r\nbest to keep on cultivating while it is growing, and another man says\r\nthat that will kill the trees. I want to know which is the best.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I think cultivation is the thing that ought to be done\r\nuntil the trees get well to bearing, anyway, and then it furnishes\r\nnitrogen to the soil to seed it down to clover. If we don't do that we\r\nare very liable to neglect that element in the soil. The better way to\r\nmy mind is to cultivate for eight or ten years, and then I do think it\r\nis all right perhaps, for farmers, I mean, who will neglect the\r\ncultivation if they depend on it. That is, if they make up their minds\r\nit is better to cultivate than it is to seed down, their trees are more\r\napt to be neglected. During the busy part of the season they won't\r\ncultivate as constantly as they ought to. If they would do that I have\r\nnot much doubt but what cultivation would be all right right along, if\r\nyou will furnish that nitrogen that ought to be in the soil for the\r\nprotection of the crop. Clover is the easiest way to get that, and the\r\ntrees will be more sure to have the benefit of that if you sow to clover\r\nand grow a crop of hay and turn it under, possibly let it be into clover\r\ntwo years, but turn that under and cultivate for two or three years and\r\nthen put into clover again. I think that would be preferable for the\r\nfarmer, for the farmer especially, than it would to undertake to either\r\ncultivate all the time or seed down all the time.\r\n\r\nI don't believe it is a good thing to seed down where there are young\r\ntrees growing and while the orchard is young. If you will plant your\r\npotatoes in that orchard between the rows and cultivate it, you will do\r\nthe cultivating. I haven't got very much faith in the average farmer--I\r\ndon't mean you horticulturists--but the average farmer. If he will plant\r\ntrees and you advise him to cultivate them while they are young, they\r\nwill be neglected after the first year or so. He may while the fever is\r\non, he may cultivate them one year and the next year about half\r\ncultivate them, and the following years they will grow up to grass and\r\nweeds. Whereas, if he plants potatoes he gets just the right cultivation\r\nfor the trees if he cultivates the ground enough to get a good crop of\r\npotatoes. Then in the fall when he digs the potatoes he loosens up the\r\nground, and it takes up the moisture, and after the fall rains they go\r\ninto winter quarters in good shape. It seems to me that is as near right\r\nas I could recommend.\r\n\r\nMr. Hansen: What distance apart ought those apple trees to be?\r\n\r\nMr. Older: Another question along that line. Suppose we concede that a\r\nyoung orchard ought to be cultivated until it gets eight or ten years\r\nold, then which is the best when you seed it to clover to cut the clover\r\nand throw the hay around the trees for a mulch or just take the hay\r\naway, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I think it would be better to put the hay around the trees\r\nfor mulching. If the hay is used and the barnyard manure is taken to the\r\norchard that would fill the bill pretty well.\r\n\r\nNow, the distance apart? Grown trees really need about thirty feet apart\r\neach way. If you run the rows north and south and put them thirty feet\r\napart, and sixteen feet or a rod apart in the row, with a view to\r\ntaking out every other tree, you might have to go under bonds to take\r\nthem out when they are needed to come out (laughter), or else you would\r\nleave them there until you hurt your other trees. If you would take out\r\nevery other tree when they get to interfering after several years, eight\r\nor ten years, you can grow a double crop of apples in your orchard, but\r\nif you do the way you probably will do, leave them right there until\r\nthey get too close, you will--\r\n\r\nMr. Hansen: Spoil all of them?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Yes. Then you better put them out a little farther apart,\r\nand, as I said, two rods apart each way I don't believe is too far. Our\r\nold orchard that we put out in 1877 is just on its last legs now. At\r\nthat time, you know, we didn't know anything about what varieties to\r\nplant, we didn't have as many as we have now. The old orchard only had\r\nthe Duchess and Wealthy for standards, and half of the orchard was into\r\ncrabs, because I thought at that time crabs was the only thing that\r\nwould be any ways sure of staying by us. Well, those trees are about\r\nthrough their usefulness now, the standards. They have borne well until\r\nthe last two years, generally loaded, and they were put out at that time\r\nfourteen feet apart each way, breaking joints so that they didn't come\r\ndirectly opposite. And when they got to be twelve or fifteen years old,\r\nit was difficult to get through there with a team or with any\r\nsatisfaction, it was rubbing the limbs too much. Then the next orchard\r\nwe put out on the farm was twenty-four feet by fifteen or sixteen feet\r\nin the row, the rows twenty-four feet apart. I wish they were a little\r\nfarther apart, although that hasn't bothered very much about getting\r\nthrough between the rows, but it shows that a tree that is any ways\r\nspreading in its habit really needs about two rods each way. Are there\r\nany other questions?\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Do you think a Wealthy orchard under thorough cultivation,\r\nmaking a rank growth, do you think it is as hardy as an orchard seeded\r\ndown, and do you think that a Wealthy orchard would blight more than\r\nother kinds?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: If the ground is rich and under thorough cultivation it\r\ndoes tend to cause fire blight. I haven't followed it on anything but\r\nyoung orchards. When they have commenced to bear then we have generally\r\nseeded down and turned in the hogs, and we have rather neglected the\r\ncultivation after that. I do think that if we had cultivated a little\r\nmore often it would have been better.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: What do you consider the best to seed down with, clover or\r\nalfalfa?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I have never tried alfalfa. I don't see why it wouldn't be\r\nall right, if you don't try to keep it too long. It would furnish the\r\nnitrogen all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: Which kind of seeding down would you prefer, what kind of\r\nclover? Would you want the Alsike clover or sweet clover for an apple\r\norchard?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I haven't tried anything but the medium clover. The sweet\r\nclover I think would be rather a rank grower.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: If you are going to mow it, why not mow the sweet clover same\r\nas the other?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: That would be all right. If you were going to use it for\r\nmulching, I think it would be the thing, because it would be better for\r\nmulching than for feeding.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I would like to give a little experience in putting in\r\nalfalfa in an orchard. We got the seed, the Grimm alfalfa, I think, is\r\nthe name of it, and I got a good stand. We got seed from it the first\r\nyear, and I sowed more, but there seemed to be something about the\r\nalfalfa that would draw the pocket-gophers from two miles around. The\r\nsecond year I think I had nineteen of my thriftiest apple tree roots all\r\neaten off. I didn't know there was one in the field because there were\r\nno mounds at all. In the spring I found where they were at work, and I\r\ncatch on an average of twenty pocket-gophers out of that mound every\r\nyear. Talk about cultivating, the pocket-gophers will cultivate it, and\r\nthe alfalfa is pretty much all eaten out and it has come into bluegrass.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison: That question as to alfalfa; the experience is always that\r\nthe roots go too deep so it hurts the apple trees. Red clover seems to\r\nbe the clover that is favored by most people.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Mr. Ludlow spoke of the pocket-gopher favoring alfalfa. We\r\nhave a patch of alfalfa right near the apple trees. I don't remember\r\nthat I have noticed any pocket-gophers work in that piece at all. On the\r\nopposite side of the road, where it is clover and timothy, why, they\r\nwork there tremendously. I know Brother Ludlow was telling us a little\r\nwhile ago at dinner about pocket-gophers working on his place, and I\r\nwouldn't wonder if he is blessed with an extra colony of them there.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: I try to catch them all out every year. I catch out on an\r\naverage about eighteen to twenty every fall, so as to catch them before\r\nthey increase early in the spring. It seems as though they came from a\r\ndistance. I know one came into my garden this year. I didn't know there\r\nwas a gopher within a mile, and in one night he made four mounds in the\r\nmiddle of my strawberry bed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenzke: Did you ever try poisoning them?\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: No, I never did. I am most successful in catching them in a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackett: Have you got any pocket-gophers that do not make mounds?\r\nDo you understand that?\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: No, sir, I don't understand that, but when they came in and\r\nkilled the nineteen trees in the fall I hadn't seen a mound there. In\r\nthe spring I found where they were at work, and then I went after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity \"Foresters\" and Municipal Forests.\r\n\r\nPROF. E. G. CHENEY, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral cities in the state have appointed \"city foresters.\" This is a\r\nstep in the right direction, if it is a precursor to the establishment\r\nof municipal forests for these men to manage; otherwise it is a misnomer\r\nand can only be misleading to the people. The city governments, in an\r\nendeavor to create a complete park organization, have so far adopted\r\nthis title from European practice without much regard to the duties of\r\nthe officer. A forester handles trees in mass formations,--sometimes for\r\ntimber production, sometimes for the protection of water-sheds,\r\nsometimes for aesthetic effect or park purposes,--but always in the\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe handling of shade trees such as we have in our city streets is the\r\nwork of an arborist. The planting of large ornamental trees, the pruning\r\nof the individual for formal effect, the filling of cavities and the\r\nbracing of weak parts, are no part of a forester's work; nor do they\r\nnecessarily fall within his knowledge. An expert should undoubtedly be\r\nin charge of the work, but an expert arborist, not a forester. The title\r\nis, therefore, when combined with the present duties, unfortunate,\r\nbecause it gives the people--still struggling with a hazy conception of\r\nforestry--a wrong idea of the true character of the real forester's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTwo very obvious ways of avoiding the difficulty present\r\nthemselves,--either to change the title or to change the duties. The\r\nformer would probably be much easier of accomplishment, but the latter\r\nis without question the course which the city ought to pursue. Since the\r\ncities have adopted the title of \"city forester,\" and so obtained a more\r\ncomplete park organization on paper, why not make the improvement real\r\nby adopting the rest of the European practice and creating city forests\r\nfor these new officers to handle? That would indeed be a real\r\nimprovement, and one without which any city park system is lamentably\r\nlame.\r\n\r\nNearly every large city has some large park within in limits kept in a\r\nmore or less natural condition as a recreation ground for its people,\r\nthus recognizing its influence for health and social betterment. How\r\nmuch it would increase this influence if there were a considerable tract\r\nof forest within easy reach of the city! How much better approach it\r\nwould make to the city than the unsightly waste places so often\r\nencountered! How much better setting it would make for the suburban\r\nresidence sections!\r\n\r\nSuch a municipal forest is not a Utopian dream, but a practical thing\r\nwell within the reach of almost any city. The law passed by the last\r\nlegislature makes it possible for a city to purchase land for such a\r\npurpose either within or without the city limits. The activities of the\r\npresent park boards show that money can be obtained to carry out such\r\nplans. The establishment of the forests would be less expensive than is\r\ngenerally imagined. The amount of money expended on the Gateway Park in\r\nMinneapolis would buy hundreds of acres of city land within fifteen\r\nmiles of the city. With the aid of a municipal nursery, such as every\r\npark system should have, this land could be planted up at a total\r\nexpense, for stock and labor, of six to eight dollars per acre. The cost\r\nof maintenance would be limited to the patrol of the tract to prevent\r\nfire and trespass. Of course, there might be no money revenue from the\r\nforest for many years, but in a comparatively short time it would begin\r\nto fulfill its purpose as a park, and once the timber is mature, there\r\nwould be a continuous net annual income of from five to ten dollars per\r\nacre. Suppose that the city had 10,000 acres of such forest paying a net\r\nannual revenue--in addition to its full services as a park--of from\r\n$50,000 to $100,000 toward the maintenance of the other city parks, and\r\nit must be remembered that for every dollar of net revenue the forest\r\nwould pay an additional dollar or more in wages to swell the coffers of\r\nthe city;--certainly that would be something very much better than\r\nanything that the city has at present.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul, with the bottom lands and cliffs on either side of the river\r\nbetween Hastings and Minneapolis, could make a beautiful and profitable\r\npark of what now threatens to develop into a monumental waste. Duluth\r\ncould make a forest which would be unsurpassed in beauty and usefulness\r\nby any in the world out of the brushy, unoccupied, rock-bound hills as\r\nfar west as Thompson. Mankato has a glorious chance for the same work\r\nalong the Minnesota valley. Virginia and Hibbing could do nothing better\r\nthan make such use of the rocky, mine-scarred hills in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nAnd so opportunity might be cited for almost any city in the state. For\r\nthe municipal forest need not be confined to the big cities. In fact, in\r\nsome respects the smaller city has an advantage over the larger place.\r\nSuitable land can usually be obtained near the city at a much more\r\nreasonable price and the revenue obtained bear a much larger ratio to\r\nthe total expenses of the town. There are some small towns in Germany\r\nwhere the entire running expenses are paid by the revenues of the town\r\nforest, and one or two where the forest not only pays all of the taxes\r\nbut also pays a cash pension to a number of the older inhabitants.\r\n\r\nCertainly our towns, looking forward to an endless and progressive\r\nexistence, cannot afford to neglect this opportunity to develop a useful\r\npark, to provide a source of cheap wood and lumber for future\r\ngenerations and a substantial revenue for the city.\r\n\r\nExpert advice need not be employed until the size and revenue of the\r\nforest warrants it, for the State Forest Service stands ready to\r\nhelp--by the selection of land, the formulation of plans, and\r\nconsultation--any city that is wise enough to take advantage of this\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe \"city forester\" can then be a forester indeed, and one of the good\r\npoints of the European city government will have been adopted in fact as\r\nwell as in name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salome Apple.\r\n\r\nH. W. HARRISON, ROCHESTER, MINN. SO. MINN. HORT. SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salome apple is named after one of the faithful Bible characters,\r\nSalome, who was associated with Martha and Mary while our Savior was on\r\nearth and was also a witness of his crucifixion. Thus the name alone\r\ncommands respect. It was originated in eastern Canada, and it was\r\nintroduced here some twenty-five years ago by the Princeton Nursery\r\nCompany of Illinois and has proven to be very hardy on different soils\r\nand locations. It is grown in the southern tier of counties of Minnesota\r\nand as far north as New Ulm.\r\n\r\nLike all good things it has had a hard fight to overcome its opponents.\r\nAt the time it was introduced here there were Ben Davis and other tender\r\nvarieties delivered in its place in certain localities. These not being\r\nhardy of course gave the Salome a black eye. Nevertheless it is an apple\r\nthat should be grown extensively because of its hardiness, its clean\r\nappearance and upright growth, spreading just enough to admit air and\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIts fruit will keep in ordinary cellars until May or June. It is medium\r\nin size and color, red streaked with green and yellow. Flesh is yellow\r\nand sub acid. Like all winter varieties it is slow to come in bearing\r\nbut yielding heavily when it does bear, whenever other varieties do. Let\r\nus not lose sight of this excellent fruit in our desire to produce\r\nsomething new and original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow May the State University and the Horticultural Society Best\r\nCo-Operate?\r\n\r\nGEO. E. VINCENT, PRESIDENT MINN. STATE UNIVERSITY, MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, so far as I can understand, the only excuse for interpolating me in\r\na program of this kind is that you are giving so much attention to\r\ntechnical subjects, you are working so hard, you need from time to time\r\nrelief in order that you may not suffer from brain fever or any of the\r\nailments of overstudy. I am confident from this point of view anything I\r\nmay have to say will meet that need completely.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between this society and the university strikes me as\r\ntypically American. There are two ways of doing things--leaving public\r\nundertakings entirely to private initiative, to individuals, to\r\nvoluntary groups; that is one plan. There is another plan which consists\r\nin putting everything into the hands of the state. Constituted authority\r\ntakes charge of the whole life of the citizen's, all the activities and\r\nenterprise are made public, state affairs.\r\n\r\nThose are the two extremes. The dangers of those two methods are very\r\nobvious. Many enterprises left to private initiative will be done in\r\nhaphazard fashion; there will be duplication and waste. When the state\r\nundertakes all these enterprises it changes the whole aspect. Public\r\nmanagement may make for a certain efficiency, but it sooner or later\r\nundermines the initiative, the feeling of responsibility of the\r\nindividual. We are a practical people, we compromise and combine the\r\nvarious methods of doing things. It is the typical American way to\r\ncombine private initiative with a certain measure of state co-operation.\r\nThe work for horticulture in the state of Minnesota has been developed\r\nunder exactly these conditions.\r\n\r\nIf I remember rightly, this society was organized in 1867. It has\r\nassumed a definite leadership in the development of horticulture in the\r\nstate of Minnesota; the university has gradually been adapting itself,\r\nso to speak, to the work of this society. The society and the university\r\nhave officially been in close relationship. I believe that in the early\r\ndays the secretary was at the same time a university officer and for the\r\nlast twenty-five years, I am told that at least one expert of the\r\nuniversity staff has always been a member of the executive board of this\r\nsociety. This has made a personal bond.\r\n\r\nThen the society has done a great many important things. You have stood\r\nby at times when people were not perfectly certain about the importance\r\nof various kinds of scientific work. You have been steadfast. Sometimes\r\nit required courage to stand for the scientific ideals which the\r\nuniversity was attempting to carry out in important work that had a\r\nbearing upon horticulture.\r\n\r\nAnd you have, of course, the chief responsibility and distinction of\r\nhaving seen to it that our fruit-breeding farm should be established. I\r\nbelieve you were also kind enough to pick out the site, although none of\r\nyou were personally interested in the particular real estate ultimately\r\npurchased.\r\n\r\nSo that we feel--we of the university feel--that the work of\r\nhorticulture in this state is distinctly a co-operative undertaking, and\r\nthat the leadership and enterprise and vision of this society have been\r\nthe chief things that developed horticulture in Minnesota to the point\r\nit has reached. But we do believe that the co-operation of your\r\nuniversity is an important and, we hope, from now on will be an\r\nincreasingly important thing. Certain work is going on constantly at the\r\nUniversity in the various departments, and that work is of distinct\r\nbenefit because you recognize it.\r\n\r\nWe had a good illustration a few minutes ago. The professor of soils was\r\nhaving his brains picked, as he had a perfect right to have, by you. You\r\nwere asking him questions, and I noticed once or twice he said he didn't\r\nknow. That must have inspired confidence in him; I have a good deal of\r\nfaith in people who don't know it all. That shows two things--they have\r\na sense of humor, and they expect to find out. There is something\r\npathetic in a person who knows it all; it is a case of arrested\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSo out of the department of soils you expect to get the result of\r\ncareful and scientific study of the nature of soils. From the department\r\nof plant pathology you expect to learn about the various forms of plant\r\ndiseases and the way in which these may be eliminated. From the\r\ndepartment of entomology you expect to learn something about the\r\ntroublesome insects, which are so universal an annoyance. I think they\r\nsimply exist to test our character, to see whether we have courage to go\r\non, bugs or no bugs. We do the best we can to become familiar with the\r\nhabits of these nefarious creatures and let you know what we know. So I\r\nmight call attention to one or two other departments--but you know how\r\nmuch is being accomplished. You get regular reports. You have a\r\ncommittee to visit and investigate our fruit-breeding farms. If I may\r\njudge from the reports which your committee makes--I don't know whether\r\nit is because it is one of your children and you are indulgent--your\r\ncommittee seems to think good things are being done and distinct\r\nprogress recorded at the fruit-breeding farm. With your support and\r\nconfidence we are enlarging the work there. It seems we should have more\r\nland in the early future, and we may ask for your co-operation in\r\nconvincing the powers that be that such increase of territory is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHow many members have you? 3,407 members, I believe. Perhaps you have\r\nmore since that number was given this morning. At any rate, there is a\r\ngood number, and when you think of all the wisdom and all the experience\r\nthat those 3,407 people have, it seems a great pity not to get it\r\norganized in better form. Come and pick some more brains while these\r\nbrains are still available and organize this great mass of knowledge.\r\n\r\nHere is the next problem. Who are the people that are going to take your\r\nplaces? Who is to have a gold watch given him fifty years from now--or\r\ngiven to her fifty years from now? This thing is to go on, and how? It\r\ngoes on by discovering in Minnesota the horticulturally-minded people in\r\nthe state; you must always be on the lookout for people who are to do\r\nthe big things. The great European governments are considering how they\r\nare going to keep their armies recruited, how the next generation is to\r\nbe brought in and organized. That is the same problem in every nation.\r\nIt is extremely necessary to put out dragnets for specialists. There are\r\nprobably thousands of men in Minnesota who are horticulturists, they are\r\ndormant horticulturists, and your business and ours is to try to\r\ndiscover them. So the problem with us is how to get out the dragnet.\r\n\r\nYou know there is a great biological principle that is illustrated in\r\nthe lower types of animals. Millions of fish eggs are produced for every\r\nhundred that actually fertilize and amount to anything. So when you are\r\nlooking for results in a great subject, when you are trying to discover\r\npeople, when you are putting out a dragnet, you have to try a very large\r\nnumber with the hope of discovering the relatively few who really show\r\nthe divine spark, who are really the men that you are looking for.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting thing when you come to think about it, all the\r\nwhile we are looking for special ability in modern activities we do it\r\nby fashion. Fashion is something that victimizes the ladies. They do not\r\ncare for fashion itself, it is thrust upon them from the outside. Most\r\nwomen conform to fashion on the principle of protective coloring; they\r\ndo not care for it themselves, but they do not want to be conspicuous by\r\nnot conforming; so they protect themselves that way.\r\n\r\nI consider fashion is a beneficial thing when you look at it the right\r\nway. By fashion all kinds of new things are started throughout the\r\ncountry, and you discover certain people who have a special aptitude. It\r\nbecomes the fashion to do various things, and in many cases people\r\nbecome interested and develop their own special tastes and faculties.\r\n\r\nI am tremendously interested just now in rural education. We want a\r\nrural school that will be attractive. We are interested in getting\r\nhouses for the teachers to be built right alongside the school house.\r\nThen there will be the garden in connection with the house, the flower\r\ngarden and the tree planting. Some of us are looking forward to the time\r\nwhen the rural school will be the most charming spot in all the\r\ncountryside, not a place from which the teacher escapes at the earliest\r\npossible moment on Friday to return reluctantly on Monday morning, but a\r\nplace where she wants to remain, where the rural school will be the\r\ncenter of the community and community life. It will be an attractive\r\nplace for the best kind of teacher. When we can get to that point we\r\nshall be able to establish in the rural regions an institution that will\r\nbe a vital part of the whole community and a thing of joy and of beauty.\r\n\r\nThat gospel might be extended to the tree planting on the farmstead. You\r\nknow what the state art society had been doing. There is another\r\ndragnet. You have seen the Minnesota Art Journal, which is dealing with\r\nthe problems in tree planting of the farm, planting around the farm\r\nhouse; That in connection with the modern farm house that has been\r\nsuggested, these things have a very important bearing upon problems in\r\nwhich both you and the university are interested.\r\n\r\nAnd then we can look forward to the time when you will have your\r\npermanent home, if not on the farm grounds themselves at least near\r\nthere, where we could co-operate and use the same building, so that\r\nwhile it would be yours you will feel that it is being utilized\r\nthroughout the year in such a way that the expenditure of the money\r\nwould be justified.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine vista ahead of us, a vista of the things to be,\r\naccomplished by means of this American combination of private initiative\r\nand enterprise and idealism and the support of the state for certain\r\ndetails of work which can be best accomplished in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shelter Belt for Orchard and Home Grounds.\r\n\r\nA DISCUSSION LED BY JOHN W. MAHER, NURSERYMAN, DEVILS LAKE, N. DAK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: The subject this morning is to be on \"Shelter-Belt for\r\nOrchard and Home Grounds.\" I am satisfied, provided the \"Home Grounds\"\r\ninclude the whole farm.\r\n\r\nThe entire farm needs shelter, particularly from the hot, drying winds\r\nand other destructive winds that uncover and cut down crops in\r\nspringtime and carry away the fertile top soil; and the summer winds,\r\nhot winds, of course, that eat up the moisture; and those destructive\r\nwinds that sometimes harvest our barley and other crops before they are\r\ncut. We need protection from all these winds, and in this latitude these\r\nwinds blow uniformly from the southwest. So every farm should be\r\nprotected from them by a substantial shelter-belt on the west and south\r\nsides, which can also be the farm wood-lot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apple tree windbreak at Devil's Lake Nursery. Hibernal in\r\nthe foreground. Patten's Greening in the distance.]\r\n\r\nThere is another phase of protection that has been emphasized this year\r\nvery much, and that is, protection against summer frosts and late spring\r\nfrosts. A gentleman living at McIntosh, near Crookston, in this state,\r\ntold me that corn matured up there wherever it was protected from the\r\nnorth wind. At the Devils Lake Nursery we had a 400-bushel per acre\r\npotato crop protected only by the blocks of nursery stock, whereas the\r\nyield in the vicinity was from nothing to fifty bushels per acre--and I\r\nbelieve if Mr. Andrews will inquire into the location of the good apple\r\ncrops about Faribault he will probably find they were saved by similar\r\nshelter protection, or the natural lay of the land.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What is your best windbreak?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: The evergreen is the best windbreak for the reason that it\r\ngives more shelter, retains its leaves in the winter and fewer rows of\r\ntrees will make a good shelter-belt. The variety--that is, west of the\r\ntimber line in Minnesota--I should say the best would be the Ponderosa\r\npine, or bull pine, after that the jack pine may be, or else the\r\nColorado blue spruce and the Black Hills spruce.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Colorado spruce is too expensive to set out as a windbreak.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: Well, the green varieties. I don't see why they should be any\r\nmore costly than the others. Of course, they are held at a higher price,\r\nbut they make a good windbreak because they are easily grown and are\r\nperfectly hardy to stand the dry atmosphere and the hot winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: American Elm windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.]\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What is the reason there are so few of them really blue?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I don't know. There is only a small percentage, probably 15\r\nper cent., that are blue. I think the dryer atmosphere produces more\r\nblue than the more humid atmosphere. We have more blues in North Dakota\r\nthan you will find even here. I believe it is the dry atmosphere and the\r\nintense sunlight that causes the blue, because the red cedar in North\r\nDakota, the native red cedar, is really a silver cedar and has a blue\r\nsheen, or rather, a silver sheen.\r\n\r\nA Member: How large do the trees have to be to be of benefit?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I have a friend out of Devils Lake who had 160 acres of flax\r\ndestroyed by a spring wind that hits the earth at such an angle. It\r\npicked up the earth and cut the flax off, by reason of the clay hitting\r\nthe little plant, except about a hundred foot strip along the west\r\nside, and that was protected by a growth of grass and weeds not to\r\nexceed a foot in height. So it depends on the kind of wind a great deal\r\nand the angle at which the wind strikes the grounds.\r\n\r\nNow, the distance that a windbreak will protect a field has been studied\r\nout and measured and demonstrated by a great number of men. Mr. McGee,\r\nat Indian Head, gave a great deal of thought and study to the windbreak\r\nproposition and measured the distances that the shelter-belt would\r\nshelter the crops, and he came to the conclusion that for every foot in\r\nheight there would be an absolute protection for a rod in distance, and\r\noutside of that actual protection there would be a long distance that\r\nwould be partially protected. The same study was made by a gentleman in\r\nIowa--I can't call his name just now--and he came to practically the\r\nsame conclusion as to the distance that the protection reached in\r\nproportion to the height of shelter-belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mountain Ash windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.]\r\n\r\nA Member: I want a shelter mostly for apple trees. Would it be five or\r\nsix years before I receive any benefit, or seven or eight years?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: Plant your protection when you plant your apple trees, and\r\nyou will have your protection sooner than you have your apples. If you\r\nare going to do that, don't put the shelter too close to the apple\r\ntrees, which is a very common fault.\r\n\r\nA Member: How much distance would you allow for the roots?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Willow windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.]\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I should say not less than 100 feet, anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: I live in southwestern Minnesota, about thirty miles from the\r\nSouth Dakota line, and I think it is a mistake to recommend the white\r\nspruce for planting out there. The white spruce naturally grows towards\r\nthe North Pole, it extends even up to the Arctic Circle. Twenty-four\r\nyears ago I purchased a dozen white spruce from Robert Douglas, who was\r\nthen alive, and planted them northwest of my house. About five years ago\r\nthey began to fail, and now only two or three are alive, and they are\r\ncovered with dead branches. I feel sure that the white spruce have been\r\ninjured by the hot winds that come across the prairies from the\r\nsouthwest. I don't think they can stand it. There is a variety of white\r\nspruce that grows in the Black Hills, which I think will be decided to\r\nbe a different species when botanists come to study it, that will stand\r\nour prairies. Another tree that we like is the Colorado blue spruce; it\r\nis hardy and grows excellently. About twenty-three years ago, when\r\nProfessor Verner was at the head of the Forestry Department at\r\nWashington he sent me 8,000 evergreens, and I set them out. They were\r\nbull pine and the Scotch pine and Austrian pine. I was over to look at\r\nthem the other day. The Scotch pine, which have been set now\r\ntwenty-three years, are over thirty feet high, the Austrian pine about\r\ntwo-thirds as high, and the bull pine, Ponderosa, is about as high as\r\nthe Austrian pine. He told me to set these trees about two feet apart\r\neach way. I thought that too thick, so I set them in rows six feet apart\r\nand about two or three feet apart in the rows. He wished me to alternate\r\nthe planting with deciduous trees. He recommended that I add a few\r\ndeciduous trees, green ash and box elder and a few elm, and I set them\r\nas far as they would go, but they didn't go very far in setting the\r\n8,000 evergreens. Then I thought it would be a good idea to use the\r\nwolfberry that grows wild on the prairies. I set them alternately with\r\nsome of the evergreens, but as they have a very liberal root system it\r\nwas hard to get them out. The finest tree in the plantation is the\r\nAustrian pine, and if it continues to do as well as it has the last\r\nthree or four years I think the Austrian pine is going to be a very\r\nvaluable pine for shelter-belt.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Have you tested the Douglas spruce?\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: Not to a great extent. It does well in some localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soft, or Silver, Maple windbreak--to be succeeded by\r\npermanent windbreak of Bur Oak--shown growing between man and boy.]\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I think the real test is to get them as near native to your\r\nplace as you can. The area over which the white spruce grows is greater\r\nthan that of any other spruce, possibly greater than any other\r\nevergreen, especially through the northern latitudes. I don't think\r\nthere is any question about the Black Hills spruce being the white\r\nspruce that was left there growing when the other timber was destroyed,\r\nif we can adopt that theory. The white spruce from seed from the\r\nNorthwest, from the British Columbia countries especially, is perfectly\r\nhardy with you. It is perfectly hardy with us at Devils Lake, which is a\r\nvery much more severe test, whereas the white spruce from its southern\r\nlimits may not be hardy even here. I think the Black Hills spruce is\r\nperfectly hardy. The distance north and south relatively is not so\r\nimportant with reference to growing trees as to get them from too far in\r\nthe humid district. The white spruce that I would be afraid of would be\r\nthe seed from New England and from the farther east limits of its\r\ngrowth, where the conditions are so much more humid.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Do you find any trouble with too much protection for\r\norchards?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: Where the protection is too close to the orchards I think it\r\nis very bad. It destroys the air drainage--\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That is why they are liable to blight.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: And they blight also. The air drainage is interfered with,\r\nand you get blight, and you also smother the orchard. I don't know but\r\nwhat the apple and the Americana plum are about as hardy trees as we\r\nhave anywhere. I don't make any attempt to protect them specially except\r\nfrom the south and west. I don't put any northern windbreak around any\r\norchards I set out. Of course, we may lose a crop with a spring frost\r\nall right when northern protection might save it, but with us up in our\r\ncountry if we have a good spring frost it is usually heavy enough to\r\ncatch them anyway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Norway Poplar windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.]\r\n\r\nI have a question here: How long should a shelter-belt be cultivated?\r\nNow, that is a point on which I think too much emphasis is placed. If\r\nyou set out your trees as Judge Moyer did his, close together, inside of\r\na few years they will take care of themselves, they will form forest\r\nconditions very quickly, and cultivation is not necessary any more. Of\r\ncourse, if you set your trees a great distance apart where there is\r\nnothing to protect them from the burning sun, and the ground bakes and\r\ndries, then you must cultivate or mulch, but I think cultivation much\r\nbetter than mulching.\r\n\r\nAnother question: How many rows of trees make a good windbreak? My idea\r\nis that it takes twenty rows to make a good one--of deciduous trees, of\r\ncourse. Two or three rows of evergreens, planted not further than eight\r\nfeet apart and with joints broken, probably makes as good a windbreak as\r\nthe twenty rows of deciduous trees and take less ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: Wouldn't you have an open space in those trees? You wouldn't\r\nput them all together?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: If I had twenty rows of trees I would put them together.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: Would you have an open space outside of those twenty trees\r\nfor the snow to lodge in?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ponderosa Pine windbreak--at Devil's Lake (N.D.)\r\nNursery.]\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I have never known the snow to do any hurt in a twenty row\r\nwindbreak. It distributes itself in there, and the more comes the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: I have seen them broken badly with the snow.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: That would be probably the poplars and trees that break\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: On my farm I put out a row of twenty trees. Outside of that\r\nI left a space on the north and west six rods wide, and I put out some\r\ngolden willows outside of that, and that made an open space for the snow\r\nto fall in.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: That is a very good plan, to have a row of willows back of\r\nyour shelter-belt, especially around the home and orchard and barn\r\nground, to hold the snow back.\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: I found that the snow drifted into my evergreens but didn't\r\nbreak them. I used lilac bushes; I planted a long row. Lilacs are very\r\ncommon, and I got enough to plant a long row. They are now ten feet\r\nhigh, and it is a magnificent sight in summer.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I know the lilac is a splendid thing, better than the golden\r\nwillow, because they last longer. They are more hardy, and they make a\r\nbetter protection, and as far as wood goes from the golden willows you\r\nget nothing except branches unless it is the white willow.\r\n\r\nI have another question here: What would you plant around the garden?\r\nFor a windbreak around the garden orchard, that should have an inside\r\nprotection, and the shelter-belt itself should be too far away from the\r\ngarden to be sufficient protection. Around the garden I would plant\r\nJuneberry or dogwood or any of those common native berry plants. They\r\nwill afford the very best kind of protection, just as good as the lilacs\r\nand just as hardy, and at the same time will produce food for the birds\r\nand bring them about your garden and keep them with you and shelter\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: The barberry--\r\n\r\nMr. Mahler: The barberry would be all right, but I prefer the Juneberry\r\nand the mulberry and the dogwood, because they come up a little higher.\r\nThe barberry is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: I had barberry, and I dug it all up.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: It spread too much?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I like the Russian mulberry.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Is the mulberry hardy with you?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: The buckthorn makes a very good protection.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Huestis: How would the golden elder do as a hedge?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: It would be a protection, but it is liable to spread too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nMr. Huestis: Do you know whether the mulberry is hardy in Minnesota or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I think from here south it is hardy, especially southeast.\r\n\r\nMr. Moyer: It occurs to me that the Tartarian honeysuckle is about as\r\ngood as any thing you can plant for birds. It is perfectly hardy on the\r\nprairies and grows up ten or fifteen feet high.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: The Tartarian honeysuckle and several varieties of the bush\r\nhoneysuckles are splendid, and they are hardy and will grow anywhere.\r\n\r\nA Member: Did I understand some one to say that the mulberry was not\r\nhardy?\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: It was stated that it wasn't hardy in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nA Member: I put mulberry trees in my garden yard that have been bearing\r\nmulberries for years and years.\r\n\r\nMr. Maher: I think the mulberry is hardy from here south and especially\r\nsoutheast. I don't think it would grow out on the prairie very far.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: It grows on the prairies southwest of here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Color Scheme.\r\n\r\nMRS. R. P. BOYINGTON, NEMADJI.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, my garden lying whitely in\r\n      The moonlight and the dew,\r\n    With its soft caressing coloring,\r\n      Breathing peace to all who view.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur garden color scheme this year was a number of red, white and blue\r\npictures, these pictures being supported, on the different sides, by\r\nbrilliant, oriental color effects.\r\n\r\nThe first picture had for its north side the south side of the cottage,\r\nwhich was covered with climbing roses (American Pillars and Crimson\r\nRambler). A bed of petunias, six feet wide and as long as the cottage,\r\ncame next, and was separated from about four hundred delphiniums\r\n(belladonna) by a walk which was bordered on both sides by a row of\r\ncandytuft and a row of forget-me-nots, blue as a baby's eye. To the\r\nsouth of the delphiniums was a great bank of bridal wreath\r\nchrysanthemums, white as the driven snow.\r\n\r\nA walk on the east had the same--candytuft and forget-me-not border. To\r\nthe south and west of this picture were irises and Oriental poppies in\r\nall the gorgeous coloring of the Orient, with a small space on the west\r\nwhere hundreds of pansies nodded their lovely faces to the stately blue\r\nlarkspurs. Are we sure, as has been said, that God forgot to put a soul\r\nin flowers?\r\n\r\nTo the east, beyond the walk, is another picture--Shasta daisies and\r\nblue cornflowers. On the north side is a brilliant hedge of red sweet\r\npeas. On the east and south of this most exquisite picture are Iceland\r\npoppies, red pyrethrums, and here and there are clumps of dark red sweet\r\nwilliam. In the early morn, just after the \"morning stars have sung\r\ntogether,\" and the forces of day are slowly coming into action, this is\r\na wonderous picture.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the cottage is a screened-in porch. Here cardinal\r\nclimber gives its myriads of cheerful bloom, while blue lobelia and\r\nwhite anemones, with the porch boxes filled with vinca atmosphere of\r\nbeauty and cheer to those who come and take the social cup that truly\r\ncheers. The broad lawn slopes north to the driveway. To the east,\r\nseparating the lawn from the walk, which is west of the canna beds, is a\r\nborder of dusty miller next the grass and one row each of blue anchusa\r\nand red snapdragon. The silver leaved poplars in the distance give a\r\nsoft sheen to the whole picture.\r\n\r\nAway to the west is a spruce hedge and inside the hedge red hollyhocks\r\nand phlox with a great row of crimson poppies. A simple garden made of\r\nsimple things, and yet as we go through it to our peony bed, that\r\ngorgeous flower, standing alone in its regal, queenly beauty, we do not\r\nwonder that when one of old walked with God it was in the cool of the\r\nevening and in a garden.\r\n\r\n    \"Where in all the dim resplendent spaces,\r\n      The mazy stars drift through\r\n    To my garden lying whitely in\r\n      The moonlight and the dew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Experience in Grape Culture.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH TUCKER, AUSTIN. SO. MINN. HORT. SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen years I have had in my garden several varieties of\r\ngrapes, namely, the Concord, Worden, Moore's Early and a green grape\r\n(not certain of its name). All have done remarkably well whenever the\r\nseason was reasonably favorable. I mean by that the absence of the late\r\nspring and the early fall frosts, which are the greatest drawbacks to\r\ngrape culture. For that reason I would not advise anyone to undertake it\r\nas a business venture on a large scale. On the other hand, where it is\r\ndesired to supply the family table with fresh fruit as long as it will\r\nkeep, also to add a variety of jellies and preserves for the winter, a\r\ndozen of vines will supply an ordinary family with grapes whose flavor I\r\nhave never seen surpassed.\r\n\r\nYou who do not always expect money to grow on everything you touch, you\r\nwho admire and love a plant or vine and feel well repaid for your labor\r\nto see it grow and bear fruit, you who have a vacant corner in your\r\ngarden well adapted to that purpose, I urge you most earnestly to plant\r\nsome grape vines, and I assure you that with some knowledge of their\r\ncare and a determination not to fail you will succeed, and you will\r\neventually be able to see a pretty sight--for, to my mind, nothing is\r\nhandsomer than a well trimmed grape row with the ripening fruit. The\r\nsoil that will grow corn will produce good grapes. My advice is to\r\nselect early ripening varieties, for then you will only have the\r\npossible spring frost to contend with, and that is easy to guard\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nDo not fail to adopt some system of pruning, for that is the most\r\nessential part of the secret to grow good grapes. Other necessary\r\ninformation will no doubt be furnished by any reliable nurseryman with\r\nwhom you are dealing. I wish to say in conclusion that so far I have had\r\nno trouble from any insects attacking the vines or fruit, and I have\r\nalways been able to produce fruit that commands the first premium\r\nwherever exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect the Garden against Winter Weather.\r\n\r\nU.S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this season many inquiries come to the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture regarding the protection of garden plants and shrubs during\r\nthe winter. Such flowers as peonies and hollyhocks will come up again\r\nthe following year if they are properly protected during the winter,\r\nwhile others, like cannas and dahlias, which are more accustomed to warm\r\nclimes, must have their roots or bulbs dug up and stored in a cellar.\r\nThe department's specialists give the following suggestions for \"putting\r\nthe garden to bed\":\r\n\r\n_Hardy Perennials._--Cover hardy perennials, such as peonies, larkspur,\r\nhollyhocks, columbines, iris, platycodons and perennial poppies, with a\r\ngood coating of manure or other litter to a depth of 3 or 4 inches. In\r\nmore southern localities this will hold the frost in the ground and keep\r\nthe plant from alternately freezing and thawing; in more northern\r\nregions the manure will protect the plant from freezing to a depth that\r\nwill cut off its water supply.\r\n\r\n_Cannas and Dahlias._--As soon as the tops of cannas, dahlias,\r\ngladiolus, caladiums and similar plants are killed by frost, dig up the\r\nroots or bulbs and store them in a cellar where the temperature will\r\nremain at 55 degrees, and should never go below 50 or above 60 degrees.\r\nDo not shake any more earth from the clumps of cannas and dahlias than\r\nis necessary in removing them from the ground. Place the plants on racks\r\nor in slat boxes so the air may circulate freely through them. No frost\r\nmust reach the roots nor must they become too warm or dry.\r\n\r\n_Shrubs._--As a rule shrubs should not be trimmed in the fall. This\r\nprocess is timely immediately after the blooming period, if this is in\r\nthe spring, as in the case of the snowball. If the shrubs bloom in the\r\nfall, as do some hydrangeas, the rose of Sharon, and some lilacs, they\r\nshould not be cut directly after blooming but in the spring of the\r\nfollowing year. Lilacs, snowballs and mock orange should be let alone\r\nduring the winter, being neither trimmed nor covered with straw and\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n_Roses._--Almost all kinds of roses are hardy in the vicinities of\r\nWashington, D.C., and St. Louis and to the south of a line drawn between\r\nthese points. From Washington northward local conditions influence the\r\nsuccessful cultivation of certain varieties. Some roses, as the brier\r\nand rugosa, need no protection, but other varieties, such as the hybrid\r\nperpetuals, teas and hybrid-teas, need special care, particularly north\r\nof the fortieth parallel. Teas and hybrid teas hardly succeed in\r\nChicago, although the hybrid-perpetuals grow as far north as Canada. All\r\nthese classes do well on Long Island and in Boston near the sea when\r\nproper care is given them. These varieties in the vicinity of Washington\r\nneed merely a little manure on the ground to prevent alternate freezing\r\nand thawing. Farther north, however, they should be treated as follows:\r\n\r\nCut the tops to within 30 inches of the ground. Cover the roots with\r\ncoarse manure or leaves or similar litter. Hold this in place by\r\nevergreen boughs which also acts as a protection. Brush from deciduous\r\ntrees or shrubs may be substituted for the evergreen boughs except in\r\nthe most northern regions.\r\n\r\nMounds of earth about six or eight inches in height should be drawn\r\nabout the base of the rose bushes to keep them from mice. As an added\r\nprotection against mice, permit the ground to freeze slightly before\r\nwinter protection is supplied. In fact, roses should not be protected\r\nuntil after the first light freeze, which may be expected in Washington,\r\nD.C., about the first of December, but earlier farther north. (Tops must\r\nbe protected in Minnesota.--Sec.)\r\n\r\n_Climbing Roses._--In the latitude of Philadelphia and farther south\r\nclimbing roses usually need no protection during the winter unless they\r\nare a particularly tender variety. Farther north these roses need\r\nprotection similar to that given to the tea and hybrid tea roses.\r\n\r\nWhere it is possible to do so, remove climbing roses from their\r\nsupports, and cover the branches with a little dirt. A little fall\r\ntrimming might be desirable to lessen the space occupied by the branches\r\non the ground. Such side branches as are not to be needed for next\r\nseason's blooming may be cut off. Such cutting off and shortening of the\r\nends as would otherwise be done in the spring may be done in the fall\r\nbefore covering, merely for convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Asparagus.\r\n\r\nA DISCUSSION LED BY E. W. RECORD, MARKET GARDENER, BROOKLYN CENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Member: I want to ask if many put salt on asparagus?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Salt is very good, but I think only for the reason that it\r\nmakes the plant tender and keeps down insects. But if I was to use\r\nanything to keep insects down I should use Paris green. Shorts or bran,\r\nthat is the best for cutworms. Everybody knows that with the least\r\nscratch or mar on the side of the asparagus it will grow crooked, and\r\nthen it is a pretty hard proposition to get it into the bunch ready for\r\nmarket in any kind of shape.\r\n\r\nA Member: Some have the idea that salt helps the growth of the plant.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Well, I never found it did.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin: I would like to know how to control rust on the stems in\r\nthe summer time.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Well, I can't answer, but I find that the Palmetto has less\r\nrust on it than any other variety. I have never been bothered with\r\nasparagus rust yet.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin: After the bed gets to be a few years old the grass and\r\nweeds commence to come up. After you get through cutting, it is pretty\r\nhard work to get in there and clean them out. Do you find it the best\r\nway to hoe them after you get through cutting?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I will tell you. I cultivate right over the tops of the rows\r\nand keep on cultivating until the asparagus comes up and begins to\r\nsprout. By the time the weeds come up the second time, it is time to\r\nquit cutting.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin: How deep do you put the plant below the surface in\r\ntransplanting?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: From twelve to fourteen inches. In the east they are growing\r\nasparagus, and they set out their plants, and they fill in and wait\r\nuntil the asparagus comes up and then they fill with rotted manure and\r\nnever fertilize any more, but here there are very few that do that. I\r\nnever did, but I find in putting on manure broadcast a year afterwards\r\nthe shoots were very crooked. I did that one year only. After I put it\r\non I thought I would have something good, and I didn't have anything. As\r\nsoon as it comes up it starts to get crooked.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin: You mean to say that putting manure on top makes the\r\nasparagus crooked?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: That was my experience.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin: I have always practiced that. I think what makes it crooked\r\nis cultivating the top and cutting the crowns off.\r\n\r\nA Member: When the weeds come in we disk it.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I never like to disk it. If your bed is very old you are\r\nliable to cut some of your crowns rather than to keep the weeds out.\r\n\r\nA Member: Your manure would be all gone then?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I know there was a man right adjoining me who had an\r\nasparagus bed, and he used a lot of rotten manure the summer before, and\r\nhe got very little asparagus that was marketable. I asked him what the\r\ntrouble was, and he said he didn't know. This year he had a good crop. I\r\ncan't say it was the manure that did that, only it looks that way.\r\n\r\nA Member: How would you start a new planting?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I would plow my ground thoroughly and get it in good shape.\r\n\r\nA Member: Wouldn't fertilize the first season?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I would. I would fertilize my asparagus ground two years.\r\n\r\nA Member: I mean in preparing your patch for the new planting?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I would first plow and harrow and then fertilize. Plow both\r\nways from fourteen to sixteen inches deep and with a fine cultivator\r\nloosen up the bottom of furrow and put in the plants and cover with a\r\nlittle earth. Then with the horse keep filling in the furrow. I saw this\r\nsummer several men with hoes working. That is all right, but it takes a\r\nlong time, especially with the proposition we are up against about hired\r\nhelp. I can do it just as well with the horse and four times as fast.\r\nThe second year you can harrow it any way you want to.\r\n\r\nA Member: Common corn land, is that fit for raising asparagus?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Yes, sir, asparagus will grow on poor ground better than\r\nmany other vegetables will.\r\n\r\nA Member: Will it improve that land by fertilizing with top dressing?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I think so.\r\n\r\nA Member: The heavy land I suppose wouldn't be good for it?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: They raise good asparagus on clay land, but I don't think it\r\nwill grow as good as on sandy soil. It is not quite so warm; it packs\r\nharder and I think more liable to grow crooked.\r\n\r\nA Member: I was called out to see a man's asparagus bed. He asked me\r\nwhat kind of ground I thought it must be, and I said a light soil. This\r\nman had a heavy clay, and it rained on it, and then the sun came out\r\nvery hot and the top cooked, and when the little shoots were to come up\r\nthey turned back. That ground wasn't good for asparagus.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: It should have been harrowed well after that rain.\r\n\r\nA Member: You see he couldn't get in there.\r\n\r\nA Member: What fertilizer is good? Is bone meal good?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Any commercial fertilizer is good, I think. Bone meal is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford: Can you raise asparagus successfully in the shade or a\r\npartial shade?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Well, I wouldn't want too much. I have shade on both sides\r\nof mine; it is a hedge. I notice it isn't near so good next to the hedge\r\nas it is out in the middle of the bed, although shade on both sides\r\nprotects it from the wind and makes it hotter. The hotter it is, the\r\nfaster it will grow.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford: I asked the question because I have a west line shade\r\nseveral years old, trees are willow and box elder. Considerable of the\r\nground is a loss to me, practically so, from that shade.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I don't think it is a very good place for asparagus.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask if a person on clay soil could use sawdust\r\nto work in?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Horse manure with sawdust, we use a great deal of that, that\r\nis, planing mill shavings. That is all right. That will loosen up the\r\nground some, but when it is turned over, of course, it will harden up\r\nagain if there comes a good hard rain on it.\r\n\r\nA Member: How many years have you maintained a bed?\r\n\r\nMr. Record: Why, it will go from twelve to fourteen years, although the\r\nplace that I am on now, I know that was good for twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six. It is practically gone now, but for twenty years it was\r\ngood. But of late years it won't run over twelve to fifteen.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard: I would like to ask something about changing an old\r\nasparagus bed to a new position.\r\n\r\nMr. Record: I wouldn't advise you to use the old roots. You get a bed\r\nquicker by using plants that are two years old, and of course there are\r\nsome plants better than others. I bought my plants in the east. Now they\r\nhave good plants here, a good many of them, too, but I have never seen\r\nanything as good as I got for my last bed. The best way if I was going\r\ninto it, being a market gardener, would be to go to some neighbor that\r\nhad a good straight bed and get my own seed. It is very easy to save,\r\nand most anyone would give a man all he wanted and charge him nothing.\r\nAll he would do would be to gather it up.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: I would like to ask--I only grow for kitchen garden and I\r\npresume most of us are in the same boat--we were told to plow a furrow\r\ndeeply and fill it with good manure and to plant the roots with the\r\ncrowns about four inches below the surface of the bed.\r\n\r\nMr Record: Well, I wouldn't fertilize it first. I would, as I say, plow\r\nmy furrow and loosen up the bottom of it, so that the plants will get a\r\nchance to get started. You know if you are plowing it out or shoveling\r\nit out it will get down to hard ground. That isn't so good. You loosen\r\nup the bottom and put your plants evenly over the ground and put in a\r\nlittle dirt, and if you have it a little barnyard manure.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: I suppose the idea of putting that in the bottom is that it\r\nis so hard to cultivate the manure on the top without doing as you\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Running Out of Varieties.\r\n\r\nPROF. C. B. WALDRON, HORTICULTURIST, AGRI. COLLEGE, N.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no fact more familiar to gardeners, orchardists and farmers\r\nthan the \"running out\" of varieties, and no question that is more\r\nobscure as to its causes. The possibility of deterioration of varieties\r\nis noted to a greater or less extent in all field and garden crops,\r\nparticularly with those that are most highly developed, or which\r\nrepresent the greatest departure from the original species.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the cause must lie either in the environment which\r\nsurrounds the variety or in the selection which it has received, or in a\r\ncombination of the two. It is held also by some that aside from the\r\ninfluence of soil and climate, and in spite of the most rigid selection,\r\nthere is an inherent tendency in varieties to depart in a more or less\r\nmarked degree from the type in which they first appeared. This is\r\nparticularly true of new varieties that have not yet become established.\r\nAlmost before the plant breeder can determine their type they have\r\nbroken up into so many distinct forms that it is impossible to get any\r\nfurther than the first generation.\r\n\r\nThis has been noted several times with new varieties of squashes and\r\nother cucurbits, and to a similar but less marked degree with tomatoes\r\nand some other garden crops. These might well be termed evanescent\r\nvarieties, and since they never become fixed or find their way into\r\ncultivation they are of interest only to the plant breeder.\r\n\r\nThe influence of environment, particularly soil and climate, upon the\r\nsize, quality and productiveness of certain garden crops is well known,\r\nthough just what effect this may have in determining the hereditary\r\ncharacter of a variety has never been very well worked out and is still\r\na matter of much doubt. We know, for instance, that there is a tendency\r\nfor corn grown in the middle or southern latitude to attain to a larger\r\nsize and require a longer period for maturity than the same corn grown\r\nin the north. This tendency is shown in the first generation, but\r\nwhether it appears as a constant hereditary character or not is still\r\nopen to discussion.\r\n\r\nThere are those who maintain that it is just as practical to develop a\r\ndwarf, early variety of corn in the middle latitudes with careful\r\nselection as it is to develop a variety of equal earliness when the\r\nplanting is done in the north. These maintain that the reason the\r\ndwarf, early varieties of corn are not normally developed in the middle\r\nlatitudes is because the selection in those places is usually made from\r\nthe large plants which yield well, instead of from the small, early\r\nplants, such as would be naturally selected at the north.\r\n\r\nBy the same reasoning it is held that the constant growing of any\r\nspecies or variety in the northern latitudes does not increase hardiness\r\nbut only enables us to determine which is hardy, thereby enabling us by\r\nselection to increase the hardiness of our varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cat-leaf weeping birch and shrubbery on campus of\r\nAgricultural College at Fargo, N.D.]\r\n\r\nWe must admit that this reasoning has a sound scientific basis, its\r\nprincipal weakness at the present time being that there has not been\r\nenough experimental work done to determine how general and constant its\r\napplication is.\r\n\r\nHowever true it may be as a scientific principle, we have on the other\r\nhand the undoubted fact that varieties of certain plants, like the\r\ncauliflower, are so strongly modified by environment that the varieties\r\ndisappear altogether as such unless the breeding plants are grown under\r\nvery definite conditions. It is well known that cauliflower seed can be\r\ngrown, for instance, only in certain parts of Europe around the North\r\nSea and to a limited extent in the vicinity of Seattle, and that\r\ncauliflower seed from any other region produces plants which not only\r\nlose all varietal characteristics but which scarcely resemble\r\ncauliflower at all.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this same principle millet affords an excellent\r\nexample. Grown at the north for a number of years, without change of\r\nseed, it becomes short with stiff straw and very large heads, yielding a\r\nlarge quantity of seed. When grown as far south as Tennessee for a\r\nperiod of five years only, it assumes a very different character, being\r\ntall and leafy with small heads and not very productive of seed. It\r\nmight be possible by very rigid selection to develop a variety of millet\r\nthat would tend to be tall and leafy even in the north, but it is\r\ndoubtful if it would remain so, and the difficulty of keeping it up to\r\ntype would be too great to make it profitable.\r\n\r\nAll this is equivalent to saying that there are certain unstable\r\nvarieties that are so influenced by climate that it is not good practice\r\nto try and keep them up to any given standard except when they are grown\r\nin regions which naturally develop the type that we are seeking to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nThe more striking examples coming under this class are cauliflower,\r\nmillet, onions, tobacco and some of the flowering plants.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was supposed that the running out of varieties of\r\ncelery was due to a similar cause, that is, to unfavorable environment.\r\nTo this was ascribed the pithy quality that characterized some of the\r\nvarieties. Upon further investigations, however, it was found that this\r\npithy condition came about through carelessness in seed selection. There\r\nis a more or less inherent tendency in all celery to become pithy, and\r\nunless these plants are carefully excluded, the varieties will run out\r\nfrom that cause.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of tomatoes, egg plant and the cucurbits do not\r\nseem to be especially affected by soil and climate, and in such\r\ninstances the varieties can be kept up only by rigid selection, no\r\nmatter how favorable that environment is under which they are grown.\r\nWith these plants there is always the inherent tendency to go back more\r\nor less to the wild state, and lapse of care in seed selection for a\r\nperiod of only a few years will result in a variety very different from\r\nthe one which we had in the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that in some instances the best plan is for\r\neach farmer or gardener to develop his own strains of crops that he\r\ngrows, while in other cases it is best to leave the selection to those\r\nthat are working in a more favored environment so far as those varieties\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be considered the plants that are propagated\r\nasexually, like potatoes and all our cultivated fruits. From the fact\r\nthat a number of our standard varieties of apples and some other fruits\r\ndate back one hundred years or more, and are still as productive as at\r\nthe beginning, it is evident that some asexually propagated varieties\r\nmay be considered almost fixed or permanent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Niobe willow (Salix vitellina, var. pendula nova), on\r\ncampus N.D. Agri. College, Fargo.]\r\n\r\nThe buds or scions from which new trees are started are taken\r\nindiscriminately from the bearing trees, and since there is no great\r\nvariation in them the varieties do not tend to change. Whether they\r\ncould be improved by taking scions from only the most productive trees\r\nis still a question. There are some who consider this possible, but we\r\ndo not yet have enough experimental evidence to establish it as a fact.\r\nSo far it would seem that about the only crop which is propagated\r\nasexually that is likely to deteriorate, or is capable of improvement,\r\nis one that is directly modified by soil and climate.\r\n\r\nThe potato is the most striking example of this class of crops. It is\r\nwell known that the potato responds very readily in the matter of size,\r\nyield and quality to certain types of soil and climatic conditions. It\r\nis also known that the qualities thus acquired seem to be more or less\r\npermanent; that is, that potatoes brought from the north, especially\r\nthose which have been grown in heavy soil, will produce a crop some ten\r\ndays earlier and thirty per cent larger than a crop grown from seed\r\nproduced in a region six hundred miles farther south. Early Ohio\r\npotatoes grown in North Dakota, when used for seed in southern Iowa,\r\ngive a much larger and somewhat earlier crop than the native grown seed.\r\nThis would indicate that the potato is bound to run out in a measure if\r\ngrown continually in southern latitudes, and in this instance a change\r\nof seed, using always the seed from the northern latitudes and the\r\nheavier soil, is necessary, in order to keep the variety up to standard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carnege library and flower beds at N.D. Agricultural\r\nCollege, Fargo.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that while there is no question as to the fact of\r\nvarieties running out, that they differ a great deal in this respect,\r\nand it is only through a knowledge of the facts covering each variety,\r\nor at least the varieties of each species, that would enable a grower to\r\nknow what to do in order to keep a variety up to the highest standard.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: What is the matter with the old Wilson strawberry?\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: I think people forgot about it and began growing better\r\nvarieties. I know there is an impression among strawberry growers that\r\nthe Wilson strawberry has run out. I don't know. I know it has been\r\nsupplanted by other varieties, and the general impression of most men is\r\nthat it is because other varieties, better varieties, came in and that\r\nvariety was neglected.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: It can be found in eastern catalogs now.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: Isn't it as good now as it was?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That is what I want to know.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: I understand that it is from the people that have grown\r\nthem. I don't know of any strawberry in my career from the first time\r\nthat I have been working in strawberries that seems to be any poorer now\r\nthan it was twenty-five or thirty years ago. The Wilson might be an\r\nexception. I know that has been referred to as an instance of\r\ndeterioration of variety. The strawberry might be so dependent on\r\nclimatic and soil conditions that it might be classed with the potatoes\r\nand not be in a class with the apples, which don't seem to deteriorate.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: Is there such a thing as a pedigreed strawberry plant that\r\nis taken from runners?\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: We have experiments going on at the agricultural college\r\nnow. We set out a number of plants from strawberry growers that\r\nadvertise a pedigreed strawberry, and beside those we have strawberry\r\nplants from growers who don't advertise them as pedigreed. This year we\r\nought to get some returns on that; last year the patch was flooded\r\nout--we had very heavy June rains. We have about ten varieties from a\r\nlarge number of different growers, some supposed to be perfect and some\r\nnot. We are going to have some report of them at the next horticultural\r\nmeeting. I don't believe there is anything much in pedigreed\r\nstrawberries.\r\n\r\nThe President: In the state of North Dakota our friend here who has just\r\nspoken occupies the same position in the hearts and minds of the people\r\nof his state as do our friends Haralson, Hansen and Patten in this\r\nsection. His work is along a little different line, his being almost\r\npurely an agricultural section, but he is a very practical man and is\r\ndoing splendid work up there.\r\n\r\nMr. Doty: I wish to say a word on this strawberry question. Some years\r\nago the postmaster at Monticello wanted to know of me what kind of\r\nstrawberries to set out; I was handling nursery goods at that time. I\r\ntold him I would recommend to him the Wilson, the Warfield and the\r\nHaverland. The Wilson I would set in the center. He had six square rods.\r\nHe set them out. The second year he invited me up to his patch and asked\r\nme to guess on how many strawberries he had raised on that patch. I\r\nsaid: \"Six bushels\"--I thought I would put it high. But he said: \"I have\r\npicked twelve bushels from that patch.\" I said: \"It can't be possible,\"\r\nand he said: \"Come right into my shop here. I have a paper here and I\r\nput down every single quart of strawberries that I have sold here.\" I\r\nfigured it up and found that he had twelve bushels out of that patch. I\r\ntold him to set the Wilson in the center, the Warfield on one side and\r\nthe Haverland on the other. He did so and that was the result, the best\r\nresult that I have ever known.\r\n\r\nThe President: How many years ago?\r\n\r\nMr. Doty: Well, it was about fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober is one of the best months in which to plant shrubs. After the\r\nleaves show them to be dormant they can be safely moved and will become\r\nestablished before very cold weather.\r\n\r\nEach year we are learning that _more_ planting can be done in the fall\r\nif done early enough, and by so doing one escapes a part of the rush\r\nthat comes in the spring. \"Anything that is hardy can be moved in the\r\nfall,\" an old nurseryman once said to me, and it has been a safe rule to\r\nfollow. But note the word \"hardy\" in his advice. All stock, either\r\nshrubbery or perennials, that are planted in the fall should be well\r\nmulched.\r\n\r\nThe bulbs for the spring garden, except those that require early\r\nplanting, will also need to be put in this month in order to make a good\r\nroot growth before frost overtakes them. Here we are able to achieve\r\nexact results as they very seldom disappoint us as to color or time of\r\nblooming as some other plants do.\r\n\r\nHave you tried planting your bulbs with any of the ground cover plants\r\nthat will take away the bare look that most bulb beds have? The arabis\r\nwith its snowy blossoms is beautiful beneath the early tulips. The\r\nviolas--with such a wide range of color--make lovely backgrounds for the\r\nlater tulips, as also do the creeping phlox and the native lavender blue\r\ndivaricata phlox. A bed of this beneath pale pink Darwin tulips is one\r\nof the lovely memories of last spring's garden.\r\n\r\nAnother snowy white flower is the perennial candytuft, Iberis. Blooming\r\nat the same time and remaining lovely for a long period it combines well\r\nwith any of the tall tulips or narcissi or daffodils. Alyssum saxatile,\r\nwith its sheet of gold, and the dear forget-me-nots, both grow well\r\nbeneath the tulips. The fine lacey tufts of meadow rue are lovely among\r\nthe pink and white and rose tulips. Surely the bulb beds need not be\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nThe very early blossoms are always the most welcome. So plant some\r\nbulbs, at least twenty-five, of scillas, snowdrops, snowflakes (Leucojum\r\nvernum). These, if left undisturbed, will increase greatly. The\r\nchionodoxas, grape hyacinths and crocuses are all well worth planting,\r\nbut do not put the latter in the grass as they will not do well there in\r\nour climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR OUR ROSE GROWERS.\r\n\r\nMembers of the American Rose Society have been raising money to employ a\r\ntrained plant pathologist to study diseases of roses. The work has been\r\nbegun under Dr. L. M. Massey, of the New York State College of\r\nAgriculture, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.\r\n\r\nBy co-operating with Dr. Massey all growers of roses will greatly\r\nincrease the efficiency of the investigations. A rose disease survey\r\nwill first be made. It is here that all rose growers can help by sending\r\nspecimens of diseased plants, with a statement regarding varieties\r\naffected, nature and extent of the injury, time of appearance of the\r\ndisease and any other things that have been noticed regarding it.\r\nInformation for the control of the disease will be given by Dr. Massey.\r\nThe following directions are given to those sending specimens:\r\n\r\n\"The material sent should be freshly collected and should show various\r\nstages of the development of the disease. Where roots are sent it will\r\nusually be undesirable to enclose any soil. Where convenient specimens\r\nshould be mailed so as to reach Ithaca the latter part of the week.\r\nPlace leaves, buds, etc., between the leaves of an old newspaper, a few\r\nbetween each two sheets.

BRAND, NURSERYMAN, FARIBAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the first thing I can remember, as I look back over the years that\r\nare past, is my father's field of peonies, and of a man standing at a\r\ntable with a large peony clump before him cutting it up into divisions.\r\nI remember wondering how such beautiful flowers could come out of such\r\nan ugly, dirty root. The bright little eyes, some red, some white and\r\nothers pink interested me, and boy fashion I put many questions to the\r\nman about them. And then my father came by and noticing my interest in\r\nthe matter, though a busy man, stopped and explained to me the process\r\nof dividing the roots.\r\n\r\nThat was forty years ago, but from that day to this I have watched with\r\never increasing interest the growth and handling of peonies. I was but a\r\nsmall boy then, but I remember my father gave me his big pruning knife,\r\nand under his guidance I divided my first peony. And I thought I had\r\ndone fairly well, for he patted me on the head and said it was well done\r\nand that some day I would make a nurseryman.\r\n\r\nThe peony industry as far as the West was concerned was in its infancy\r\nthen. We had few varieties--peony buyers had not yet become critical. I\r\ncan remember of but four sorts: the white variety, Whitleyii, now called\r\nQueen Victoria; the red Pottsii and the two pinks, Fragrans and Humeii.\r\nPeonies were then sold as red peonies, white peonies and pink peonies,\r\nand that was all there was to it, and the customer felt very lucky if he\r\ngot the color he ordered.\r\n\r\nBut a wonderful change came over the industry along in the nineties.\r\nSome of the better varieties had worked west in different ways, and\r\npeople began to waken to the fact that there were more than simply red\r\npeonies, white peonies and pink peonies. Such varieties as Festiva\r\nMaxima, Edulis Superba, Marie Lemoine, Eugene Verdier and the like came\r\nto us. Flower lovers slowly began to realize that the old, despised\r\n\"piny\" of mother's garden was a thing of the past, and that here in its\r\nstead we had a glorious and beautiful flower. And as the better\r\nvarieties have continued to come from year to year, the interest in the\r\nflower has continued to increase until now I think I am safe in saying\r\nthat in the colder portion of our country at least, and in our own state\r\nin particular, the interest manifested in the peony is greater than that\r\ntaken in any other flower.\r\n\r\nAnd it is of this modern peony that I am asked to tell you--of its\r\ncultivation and care, how it is multiplied and how the new sorts are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nRight here at the start I wish to correct an erroneous impression about\r\nthe peony that has been spread broadcast throughout the land by means of\r\nnot too carefully edited catalogues and misinformed salesmen.\r\n\r\nWe often hear an agent say or we read in some catalogue, \"When you have\r\nthe peony planted all is done.\" Now this is not true. It comes a long\r\nways from being true. I think the very results which the following out\r\nof this belief have brought about are accountable for the production of\r\nmore poor peonies than all other causes put together. The peony, it is\r\ntrue, will stand more abuse than any other flower you can name and still\r\ngive fairly good results, but if you want good peonies you must take\r\ngood care of them.\r\n\r\nThe planting season opens about the first of September in\r\nMinnesota--probably the middle of the month is safer--and it continues\r\nright up to the freeze-up in the fall and up to the middle of May in the\r\nspring. We have lifted peonies that have grown a foot in the spring,\r\npacked them carefully, shipped them to middle Wisconsin, and in the fall\r\nhad the shipment reported as having done splendidly. September planted\r\nroots will bloom the following season. After that there is little choice\r\nbetween fall and spring planting.\r\n\r\nThe peony root will stand lots of abuse after being thoroughly ripe, but\r\nstill it is best to handle it with care. Keep it fresh and plump until\r\nplanted. If accidentally it becomes shriveled, immerse for twenty-four\r\nhours in a pail of water. This will revive it. Remove from the water and\r\nplant immediately. The roots should be planted with the tops of the buds\r\nfrom two to three inches below the surface--not more than three inches\r\nat the most.\r\n\r\nMany times you will notice that you have a nice, thrifty looking plant,\r\nbut that it does not bloom. Nine times out of ten if you examine into\r\nthe matter you will find that your plant was set from six to eight\r\ninches deep--and this is why it didn't bloom. Another cause of peonies\r\nnot blooming is their being planted in lawns where the soil is\r\nimpoverished by the roots of large trees.\r\n\r\nThe common method of propagation of established varieties is by\r\ndivision. Grafting is resorted to by professionals in some instances,\r\nbut that does not interest us here.\r\n\r\nThe peony will do well in any well drained soil, though a rich sandy\r\nloam is the best. It will give splendid results in heavy clay if well\r\ncultivated and if at the blooming season in case of drouth the plants\r\nare well watered.\r\n\r\nOf all soils a sandy one is the poorest for the production of bloom,\r\nalthough, on the contrary, for the rapid production of roots the lighter\r\nsoils are ideal. Such soils not only produce roots much more rapidly\r\nthan the heavier soils, but produce a root that divides easier and to\r\nbetter advantage. But it is with the cultivation of the plant that we\r\nare most interested.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, no plant will stand more abuse than the peony and\r\nstill give fairly good results, but if given a good soil and then good\r\ncultivation we have no flower that will give us more satisfaction for\r\nthe care we give it.\r\n\r\nWhen grown in large numbers peonies should be planted, if possible, so\r\nthat the plants can be cultivated with a horse. Deep cultivation seems\r\nto bring the best flowers. Where we can give horse cultivation we start\r\nthe cultivator just as early in the spring as we can. As a rule we start\r\nby the middle of April and keep it going through the plants once a week\r\nat least, and oftener if necessary, right up to the time when the buds\r\nstart to open. Cultivation here ceases until the blooming season is over\r\nand is then resumed often enough to destroy all weeds up to the first of\r\nAugust. We use one and two-horse cultivators and run the shovels to\r\nwithin three or four inches of the plants and two to three inches deep.\r\n\r\nBut few of us can cultivate in this way. Field cultivating methods are\r\nhard to apply to the lawn and garden. But we may get the same results in\r\nother ways. Clumps of peonies on the lawn should be so planted that a\r\ncultivated space encircling the plant at least a foot wide is left.\r\nThis space should be covered in the fall with a mulch of well rotted\r\nbarnyard manure which should be forked or spaded into the soil in the\r\nspring. And the soil about the plant should be thoroughly forked over,\r\nto a depth of two to four inches, three or four times before the\r\nblooming season.\r\n\r\nWhere the plants are planted in borders and beds in the garden, mulch\r\nand cultivate in the same way, stirring the soil all about and between\r\nthe plants. Care should be taken in applying the manure mulch not to get\r\nit directly over the plant if the tops have been cut back. The stems are\r\nhollow as they die out in the fall, and thawing snow and occasional\r\nrains of winter leach the strength out of the manure, and this filters\r\ndown through these hollow stems and comes in contact with the roots and\r\nrots them.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of protection the peony needs no winter mulch. For this\r\nlatitude it is perfectly hardy.\r\n\r\nAfter the blooming season cut all the blossom stems back to the leaves\r\nfor looks. Do not cut the leaf stalk back until about the middle of\r\nSeptember. By that time the plant is dormant, and all top growth can be\r\nremoved with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nMost of us are willing to spend this time and labor if we get results\r\nand to get the best results with peonies we must have good varieties. Of\r\nnamed peonies there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000\r\nvarieties. Large collections now catalogue all the way from 250 to 500\r\nsorts. From such collections it is hard for those not thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the merits of the varieties to make an intelligent\r\nselection of moderate priced peonies for a small planting. For people so\r\nsituated I make the following suggestion of varieties:\r\n\r\n_White_: Candissima, Festiva Maxima, Duchess de Nemours, Duke of\r\nWellington, Couronne d'Or, Queen Victoria, Avalanche, Madam de\r\nVerneville, Mons Dupont, Marie Lemoine.\r\n\r\n_Pink_: Edulis Superba, Model de Perfection, Monsieur Jules Elie,\r\nLivingston, Mathilde de Roseneck, Alexander Dumas.\r\n\r\n_Light Pink_: Eugene Verdier, Delicatissima, Marguerite Gerard,\r\nDorchester Eugene Verdier.\r\n\r\n_Red_: Richard Carvel, Felix Crousse, Meissonier, Rachel, Delachii,\r\nPurpurea Superba and Rubra Superba.\r\n\r\nSo much for the old peonies. Now to the new ones. And the question\r\nnaturally comes, why any new ones? With over 2,000 varieties shouldn't\r\nwe be satisfied? No! Many of the varieties catalogued might be\r\neliminated, and we should be the gainer thereby. I believe I am safe in\r\nsaying that if the present list were cut down to 300 sorts it would\r\ncover all the varieties worth while. And there is such a great chance\r\nfor improvement! So many beautiful varieties coming to us of late years\r\nbeckon us on. Crousse, Dessert and Lemoine have set the pace, and we of\r\nAmerica will not be left behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking up the rows of a bed of our seedlings three years\r\nafter transplanting. The white variety in the centre of the picture is\r\nFrances Willard, considered by us one of the world's best whites. At the\r\ntime this picture was taken, the flowers were just opening, so one gets\r\nno idea of the size of the blooms after they open.]\r\n\r\nEither eighteen or nineteen years ago my father definitely set about the\r\nbringing forth of a line of new peonies. For years he had been\r\nexperimenting with seedling apples. His immense collection of peonies\r\ngave him the idea of producing something better along that line. A great\r\nbed was planted out from which to collect seed. Hundreds of the best\r\nvarieties obtainable were planted in this bed, two of each variety, with\r\na very liberal use of the three varieties, Edulis Superba, Fragrans and\r\nTriumph de l'Ex. de Lille. Some twelve varieties of the most vigorous\r\nsingles of all colors were also used. Bees and the elements were\r\nallowed to do the cross-fertilizing. In the fall of 1899 the first seed,\r\namounting in all to about a peck, was harvested and planted. This seed\r\nwas allowed to dry and was planted just before it froze up, directly\r\ninto the field where the plants were to remain and bloom.\r\n\r\nThe seed was planted about two inches deep, in rows two feet apart, with\r\nthe seeds six inches apart in the row. Immediately after the ground\r\nfroze a two-inch mulch of coarse slough hay was spread all over the\r\nfield. This was removed in the spring and the field kept perfectly clean\r\nthat season by hand weeding, as cultivation could not be practiced. No\r\nseed germinated that year. That fall the ground was again mulched, and\r\nthis mulch removed early the next, or second, spring.\r\n\r\nThis second season just as soon as nature began to quicken the little\r\npeonies began to pierce the soil. Standing at one end of the field and\r\nlooking down the rows one could fairly see the little fellows burst\r\nforth from their long confinement and thrust their little red heads in\r\nserried ranks through the brown earth. They reminded one of line upon\r\nline of miniature red-coated soldiers on parade.\r\n\r\nA fourteen-tooth Planet Jr. horse cultivator was immediately started\r\namongst them, and intense cultivation given the bed that season. By the\r\nend of the growing season the little plants were from two to four inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe next spring, the third from the planting of the seed, the young\r\nplants burst through the ground strong and robust. Cultivation was\r\nstarted immediately, as during the season before, and the plants made\r\nrapid growth. By the middle of May, most of them were eight inches high\r\nwith an abundance of foliage.\r\n\r\nWe noticed a few buds appear this season. The strong, vigorous\r\ndevelopment of the buds, of one plant in particular, continued to claim\r\nour attention, and we watched it with intense interest. Day by day the\r\nbuds grew larger, and then finally a day came when the first petal\r\nlifted, and the next morning the petals spread forth in all their glory.\r\nIt was a gem, we realized we had something first class. My father said\r\nafter he had studied it a while, \"It pays me for all my time, and money,\r\nand work. If I never get another as good I shall be satisfied.\" It was a\r\nbeautiful dark red, very early, as good a red as Terry's Rachel. We\r\nnamed it Richard Carvel.\r\n\r\nSix other plants bloomed that season. One was of the Japanese type. The\r\nothers singles.\r\n\r\nBy the next spring the small plants were well established, and we knew\r\nby their vigorous growth that we might expect the most of them to bloom\r\nthat season.\r\n\r\nThorough cultivation was given from the start, and by the middle of May\r\nthe bed was covered with a mass of buds. June came. The blooming season\r\nwas at hand. Slowly the buds began to show color. Here and there over\r\nthe field a petal began to lift. A short space of anxious waiting, and\r\nthen a day came when it seemed as if the bed had been touched by a hand\r\nof magic, for from one end to the other it was one solid blaze of color.\r\nBefore us were thousands upon thousands of flowers and no two alike.\r\n\r\nAs quick as the flowers began to open we started to grade and mark them.\r\nIt took two men working steadily for a week to inspect and mark this\r\nbed. Everything that looked choice was marked No. 1. Everything that\r\nlooked as though it stood a chance of coming choice, if given a better\r\nchance, was marked No. 2. All other doubles were marked double with\r\ntheir color. And all singles were marked single with their color.\r\n\r\nWhen the digging season came those marked Nos. 1 and 2 were lifted and\r\ndivided and each planted in a bed specially prepared for them. Each sort\r\nwas staked. These plants were set in rows three and one-half feet apart\r\nand three feet apart in the row.\r\n\r\nIntense cultivation was given them for three years. The performance of\r\neach sort was recorded for each year. At the end of the third year those\r\nsorts which had come good two years out of the three were again lifted\r\nand planted in another soil and watched closely for another period of\r\nthree years. This gave us a pretty definite knowledge of their behavior,\r\nmade us acquainted with them. It toned down, as I might say, the\r\nenthusiasm with which we first selected them, allowed of our making\r\ncareful comparison with the best sorts, and finally enabled us to keep\r\nwhat were really choice. We did not have any need for the others.\r\n\r\nOf the ones first selected as No. 1 from the seed bed, about thirty-five\r\nin number, we finally kept eight; of those marked No. 2, about sixty. We\r\nafterwards selected two as first class.\r\n\r\nThose plants simply marked double in the seed bed were planted in a\r\nregular field bed by themselves. Each plant was divided and staked. This\r\nbed was allowed to stand three years and the plants were carefully noted\r\neach year as they bloomed for varieties that we might have accidentally\r\noverlooked in the seed bed. Among these thousands of plants we found two\r\nsorts which we called first class. One of these, though it is sixteen\r\nyears since the seed was planted, we are just about to send out.\r\n\r\nI have given you the history of this single bed because it shows about\r\nhow the seedling peony must be handled. We have since varied our method\r\nin handling in a single respect. We no longer plant our seed direct in\r\nthe field. We find it much better to plant broadcast in seed beds. These\r\nare much more economical to keep clean the first year. After the little\r\nseedlings are one year old or, better, after they are two years old, we\r\nlift them in September and plant them in a permanent bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our seedling Harriet Farnsley, a very late all one color\r\npink. This variety is in bloom at the same time as Richardson's Rubra\r\nGrandiflora, at a time when most good peonies are gone. The flower from\r\nwhich this photo was taken measured seven inches across.]\r\n\r\nNow if any of you are tempted to grow peonies from seed let me warn you\r\nnot to get too enthusiastic in anticipating results. The chances are\r\nthat 999 out of every 1,000 will have to be discarded. Test thoroughly\r\nbefore you decide to keep. The flower my father and I both decided our\r\nbest when it first bloomed we no longer keep. Our best flower is one we\r\ntook no particular notice of the first two years it blossomed.\r\n\r\nBut do not let me discourage you. Though eight or ten choice varieties\r\nmay seem small returns, still there is a pleasure in the work that you\r\ncannot fail but feel. And when you go forth into your fields after your\r\nstocks of better sorts have increased so that you can have each kind\r\nblooming about you in long rows, and as you see first this beautiful\r\nvariety and then that come into bloom, you feel well repaid for the\r\nyears of waiting and the labor you have bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand: A great many people ask the question whether just as soon as\r\nthe peony has blossomed they cannot cut the top off. It would be a great\r\nmistake to do so. Your peony growth does not complete its development\r\nuntil about the middle of September, and if you cut the top off just as\r\nsoon as the plant has blossomed you are going to have a great many of\r\nthem rot. We had a very striking illustration of this two years ago.\r\nJust as our peony season was closing we had a severe hailstorm which cut\r\nour peony beds right off down to the ground. We couldn't save the tops\r\nif we had wanted to. That fall when we dug our roots it was almost\r\nimpossible to fill our orders, because the roots were in such terrible\r\nshape. The tops were removed before they ought to have been.\r\n\r\nTalking about disappointments with peonies, I think the peony I was most\r\nimpressed with of all the seedlings we have had came good but once. That\r\nwas eleven or twelve years ago. As I look back upon it I think this was\r\nthe most beautiful flower we ever grew, but it never came good but that\r\nonce. I was so impressed with its beauty that I took it from where it\r\nbloomed in the seedbed and planted it at my house in the garden. When it\r\ncame on to bloom, it was a disappointment and has been such ever since.\r\nI still keep it, hoping that some year it may bloom again as it did that\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison: Not a bit of it. They are the most lying vegetable on the\r\nface of the earth. May I ask if Mr. Peterson, of Chicago, is here? He is\r\nan expert peony man. I presume we will all like to hear from him.\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: I haven't anything to add; if you want to ask questions I\r\nwill be glad to answer them.\r\n\r\nThe President: Ladies and gentlemen, you probably know that Mr. Peterson\r\nis one of the expert peony men of the United States. In fact, as far as\r\nfifteen years back we were able to get some of the newer and better\r\nvarieties from this gentleman. I never had the pleasure of meeting him,\r\nbut we want to meet you, Mr. Peterson. You have all heard of Mr.\r\nPeterson, the peony man of Chicago and a life member of this society.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: I have nothing to add. I have been in the game a good many\r\nyears. We have systematically kept track of over three hundred varieties\r\nsince 1888, so that it may be if you have any questions to ask I might\r\nbe able to answer them, and I would be glad to. The proposition that\r\nMr. Brand has stated is actually within the facts. We have raised\r\nthousands of seedlings, and not one of them do we now grow. You see some\r\nof the Peterson seedlings listed in other people's catalogues, but I\r\ndon't have one myself.\r\n\r\nA Member: What kind of varieties would you suggest for the ordinary home\r\ngarden, best dozen varieties?\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: I would name for the white peonies, the Madam de\r\nVerneville, Avalanche, Couronnes d'Or; of the pale pink, Delicatissima,\r\nMarie Crousse, Grandiflora; of the red, Monsieur Martin Cohuzac,\r\nMonsieur Krelage, Felix Crousse; of the deep pink, Modeste Guerin, M.\r\nJules Elie and Claire Dubois. I do think that Mr. Brand has some of\r\nexceptional merit that will probably be put in the red class. I don't\r\nknow his others, but Felix Crousse is undoubtedly the best of its type\r\nin the red.\r\n\r\nA Member: Have you tried out the Baroness Schroeder?\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: I surely have. It is very fine, but it is a little\r\nchangeable, not only in its habits but in its shade. If you want a\r\nperfect white, it isn't that, it is a nearly flesh white. I would say\r\nthat the Madame Emile Lemoine is finer.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you advise spraying for them?\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: No, but I tell you what was asked of me today, which is\r\nthe secret of having no disease in our plants. Any two-year-old plant in\r\nour field that doesn't bloom, we dig it up and throw it away, and that\r\nwill nip any trouble in the bud, and then you will not get any strain\r\nthat is not blooming. If we see any other defect, any that won't head\r\ngood, we take it up and throw it away. That one point I think all of you\r\ncan well follow, and that is, to dig up every two-year-old plant that\r\ndoesn't bloom and throw it away, that is, during the blooming season.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison: Some varieties will bloom and some won't. You have got to\r\npunish the whole on account of the few?\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: I do that. If I have a two-year-old plant that is blooming\r\nin a section I keep it and follow it up.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison: Any special rule about multiplying or dividing?\r\n\r\nMr. Peterson: No, except to divide in September, even possibly the last\r\nweek of August, and the earlier they are divided at that time when the\r\neyes are large, the better it is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCAN FRUIT WITHOUT SUGAR.--_Canning Specialists Say Boiling\r\nWater May Be Used Instead of Sirup._ Fruit for use in pies or salads or\r\nas stewed fruit can be put up or canned without the use of any sugar at\r\nall, according to the canning specialists of the department. They,\r\ntherefore, advise those who, because of the high price of sugar, have\r\nbeen thinking of reducing the amount of fruit they put up to can as much\r\nof their surplus as possible by the use of boiling water when sugar\r\nsirup is beyond their means. Any fruit, they say, may be successfully\r\nsterilized and retained in the pack by simply adding boiling water\r\ninstead of the hot sirup. The use of sugar, of course, is desirable in\r\nthe canning of all kinds of fruits and makes a better and ready\r\nsweetened product. Moreover, most of the fruits when canned in water\r\nalone do not retain their natural flavor, texture and color as well as\r\nfruit put up in sirup. Fruit canned without sugar to be used for sauces\r\nor desserts must be sweetened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Retail Methods and Costs.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE W. MOOMAW AND M.M. STEWART, FRUIT AND PRODUCE MARKETERS,\r\nPORTLAND, OREGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn studying the various phases of city apple marketing, special\r\nattention was given to retail methods and costs. The purpose of this\r\nstudy was chiefly to learn whether the wholesale supply controls the\r\nprice. The cost of operation as a factor in determining retail prices\r\nalso was investigated as far as possible.\r\n\r\nRetail apple distributors may be classed as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Fruit-stand vendors.\r\n\r\n(b) Fancy grocers, fruiterers, etc., catering almost exclusively to\r\nhigh-class or fashionable trade and doing a very extensive credit\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n(c) Grocers catering to a cheaper class of trade, largely upon a cash\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n(d) Hucksters or street peddlers.\r\n\r\nRelatively high prices were charged for apples purchased at fruit\r\nstands. Extra fancy Northwestern and Colorado Jonathans were sold to the\r\ndealers during October and November at prices ranging from $1 to $1.25\r\nper box. Apples which grade 150 to the box retailed at two for five\r\ncents, or $3.75 per box. This meant a gross profit of about 250 per\r\ncent. In the ninety-six size, extra fancy Jonathans sold at three for\r\nten cents, or $3.20 per box, showing a gross profit of about 200 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIn the East Side tenement section of New York City it was learned that\r\nby reason of the cheap prices prevailing and the heavy supply of apples\r\narriving the peddlers were operating to the detriment of fruit stands.\r\nThe fruit-stand dealers were selling only about one-third to one-half\r\nthe quantity of fruit handled in former seasons. The pushcart and wagon\r\npeddlers as a rule buy packed or loose fruit cheap and go direct to the\r\nhomes of the residents, selling at prices considerably below the\r\nfruit-stand men. The peddlers handle a large quantity, make quick cash\r\nsales, and pay no rents. Other dealers incur heavy operating expenses\r\nand generally sell not for the purpose of moving a large quantity, but\r\nfor the highest price obtainable. Consequently, the movement is\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nThe largest profits were found usually in barreled apples. For instance,\r\nNew York B grade, two inches minimum, approximately 600 apples to the\r\nbarrel, sold for a cent each or $6 per barrel. These apples cost the\r\nretail dealer not over $2 per barrel delivered to his store, allowance\r\nbeing made for jobber's profit and drayage. The investigator saw \"A\r\ngrade\" fruit, 2-1/2 inches minimum, averaging about 400 apples per\r\nbarrel, which cost the retailer not over $3, being displayed for sale at\r\ntwo for five cents, or $11.25 per barrel. Such prices prevailed at no\r\nless than twenty-five retail stores visited in one day. Apples were\r\nbeing offered for sale at retail all over New York City at prices\r\nranging from one cent each at the cheap corner fruit stands, to fifty\r\ncents and eighty cents per dozen at the fanciest fruit stores.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that the gross profits of fruit-stand vendors\r\nrange from 100 to 250 per cent. Operating expenses other than rent in\r\nmost cities except New York are not relatively high and all sales are on\r\na strictly cash basis; hence the net profits on good fruit are large.\r\n\r\nGrocers catering to high-class trade buy only the best apples. Extra\r\nfancy Jonathans, Grimes, etc., preferably 138's and 150's size, were\r\npurchased at $1 to $1.25 per box. These apples were taken from the box\r\nand repacked in small splint trays similar to the peach basket used in a\r\nsix-basket carrier. Each box of apples filled approximately ten trays.\r\nEach tray sold for thirty cents; hence the box brought $3, representing\r\na gross profit of about $1.75. Extra fancy Delicious and Winter Banana,\r\n72's size, purchased at $2 per box, retailed at five cents each, or\r\n$3.60 per box. Other sizes and varieties brought corresponding prices.\r\nNo attempt was made by this class of grocers to stimulate consumption by\r\ntemporarily reducing prices.\r\n\r\nThe retail prices quoted above were maintained consistently throughout\r\nthe 1914 season, regardless of prevailing jobbing prices. The large\r\nmargins charged by the retailers, for the most part, were due apparently\r\nto the small amount of business handled, the perishable nature of the\r\ncommodity, and the cost of operation.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate and efficient delivery service must be maintained by the\r\ngrocers, and many small deliveries are made each day at an actual loss\r\nto the dealer. A large proportion of the grocery-store patrons buy on\r\ncredit and pay when it becomes convenient. Many of these accounts are\r\nnever paid. Hence it becomes apparent that the good customer who pays\r\nhis bill regularly each week, or who pays cash, must suffer for the\r\nshortcomings of others. However, there can be little doubt that reducing\r\nprices would materially increase consumption and in the end result in\r\nequally good profits for the dealers. Reduced prices and better business\r\npractice should prove to be very beneficial to grower, dealer and\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\nThe profits derived from the sale of cheaper grades of apples to the\r\npoorer class of consumers are not so large. It was learned that those\r\ncatering to such trade operated on a margin of 75 to 100 per cent. of\r\nthe purchase price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaspberries.\r\n\r\nF. C. ERKEL, FRUIT GROWER, ROCKFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaspberries are so easily grown it is surprising we do not find more\r\nfarmers and back lot gardeners in the city giving them attention. I\r\nbelieve more people would raise raspberries if they could be made to\r\nrealize what great returns they would receive for a little work and\r\ncare. As a commercial proposition raspberries are the poor man's friend,\r\nyielding large returns with very small investment and requiring but\r\nlittle land.\r\n\r\nI will attempt to give a few essentials in raspberry culture without\r\ngoing into detail, with the hopes that at least a few more patches of\r\nraspberries may be planted as a result of my effort. With the main\r\npoints of raspberry culture given, there is no reason why any one with\r\nordinary intelligence can not solve the details and meet with success.\r\n\r\nRaspberries have a little advantage over strawberries with the man who\r\nis not greatly enthused over small fruit culture. When once established\r\nthe plantings do not have to be renewed annually but with ordinary care\r\nwill last several years, in fact they will stand more Junegrass sod and\r\nweeds and general neglect and still produce results than anything else I\r\nknow of unless it is apple trees.\r\n\r\nAnother point in favor of raspberries over strawberries is that it is\r\nnot quite so hard on the back to pick them, and when large quantities\r\nare grown it is easier to get pickers.\r\n\r\nRed raspberries will succeed on most any kind of soil so long as it is\r\nkept reasonably well fertilized and supplied with humus. They prefer a\r\nmoist loam, and a northern slope is preferable to a southern slope\r\nbecause not so quickly affected by drought. Good drainage is necessary,\r\nand if planted on low ground where water is liable to stand at any time\r\nthe ground should be tiled or otherwise drained.\r\n\r\nRaspberries may be planted either in the fall or spring, or the plants\r\nmay be dug in the fall, heeled in outside, covered with mulch, or they\r\nmay be stored in the cellar and planted in spring.\r\n\r\nPlants bought from a nursery in the spring should be unpacked\r\nimmediately on arrival, the roots dipped in thin mud, then heeled in\r\nuntil permanently planted, even if the delay is but a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the plants should be cut, leaving but a few inches, and if\r\nany blossoms appear the first season it would be better to remove them\r\nto prevent fruiting. It would be expecting too much of a newly\r\ntransplanted plant to make much of any growth and produce fruit the same\r\nseason. If allowed to fruit the first season but little fruit could be\r\nexpected at best, and it would leave the plant dwarfed if indeed it were\r\nnot killed outright.\r\n\r\nThe suckers that come up the first season will produce the next season's\r\ncrop, after which they die down and should be removed, other suckers\r\ntaking their places annually. Not over two or three suckers should be\r\nallowed to each plant the first year; after the first year leave five to\r\neight in each hill, depending on the kind of soil, fertility, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen plants are cheap and plentiful it is customary to use two in each\r\nhill to insure a good stand the first year, but it is reasonable to\r\nexpect, however, where there are two root systems in each hill instead\r\nof one that in after years there would be more troublesome suckers to\r\nremove than if there was but one root in each hill, and this is no small\r\nmatter with some varieties.\r\n\r\nTo obtain planting stock large clusters of roots may be divided to\r\npropagate from, but these usually have but few fibrous roots and are not\r\nas good as first year's growth suckers, springing from roots near the\r\nparent plant. Red raspberries may also be propagated from root cuttings\r\nor even from seeds, the latter not coming true to variety, however.\r\n\r\nPlantings should preferably be made on ground plowed the fall previous,\r\nbut spring plowed ground will answer if thoroughly disced, harrowed and\r\nplanked and then repeated, to make the ground firm.\r\n\r\nIf the ground is poor add a liberal dressing of well decayed barnyard\r\ndressing before plowing, or if not well decayed wait until after\r\nplanting to apply the manure. Future cultivations will mix the dressing\r\nwith the surface soil where the roots will be able to reach it, since\r\nraspberry plants are close surface feeders, and for this reason all\r\ncultivations should be shallow after the root system has formed.\r\n\r\nWhen the matted row system of planting is adopted, the late Prof. Green\r\nadvised using a heavy mulch for two feet on each side of the rows to\r\npreserve moisture and discourage weed growth close to the plants,\r\ncultivating only a strip through the middle.\r\n\r\nRaspberries may be planted in rows five or six feet apart to allow\r\ncultivation both ways, or in rows seven feet apart with plants two or\r\nthree feet apart in the rows with the idea of allowing a matted row and\r\ncultivating but one way after the first season.\r\n\r\nThe matted row is hardly to be recommended unless one is willing to use\r\na hoe rather freely to keep the plants free from weeds where the\r\ncultivator can not reach them, or unless he can provide a good, deep\r\nmulch to discourage weed growth.\r\n\r\nRows should preferably run north and south, so the fruit will be shaded\r\nduring the middle of the day, but this is not absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIn setting the plants place them just a little deeper than they grew\r\noriginally, carry them to the field in pails of water or thin mud,\r\navoiding exposure of the roots to the air unprotected, but do not use\r\nwater in the holes unless the ground is extremely dry. Firm the ground\r\nwell close to the plant, and cultivate between rows all summer to\r\npreserve moisture, whether weeds are troublesome or not, up to September\r\n1st and be sure to cultivate shallow after the roots begin to occupy the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHills that grow exceedingly tall and rank may be cut back to about two\r\nand a half feet in height in the spring, or if one is willing to take\r\nthe trouble to pinch off the end of the plants at this height during the\r\ngrowing season they will get bushy plants better able to hold up a load\r\nof fruit--besides cutting back has a tendency to produce larger fruit.\r\n\r\nWe only grow two varieties of red raspberries, both of which are\r\nperfectly hardy without winter covering, so we have no suggestions to\r\nmake or experiences to relate regarding winter protection. I am afraid I\r\nwould be tempted to quit the business if I had to cover our raspberry\r\nbushes for winter protection. I think it would be as big a task as all\r\nthe rest of the work combined except picking, and I let some one else do\r\nthat part.\r\n\r\nFor a home garden it is even more desirable to select a variety that is\r\nhardy without winter covering than when grown in a commercial way, for\r\nthis is one of the tasks that is liable to be neglected unless one makes\r\na business of it.\r\n\r\nIn choosing a variety the other qualities to look for besides hardiness\r\nwithout winter covering are size, color, flavor, prolificacy and good\r\nshipping qualities.\r\n\r\nWe are located only twenty-five miles northwest of Minneapolis, and one\r\nwould naturally suppose we would market our berries there, but we get\r\nbetter prices in towns along the Soo railroad in western Minnesota and\r\nthe Dakotas.\r\n\r\nAlthough our berries are a variety that crumble unless left on the\r\nbushes until ripe they do not spoil readily, which is probably due to\r\nthe fact they are quite acid, and we ship to points in North Dakota\r\nnearly as far west as Chicago is east of us with very little loss.\r\nWherever our berries have been introduced they have made friends, and\r\nthere is hardly ever a time that we do not have standing orders for two\r\nor three times as many berries as we can furnish.\r\n\r\nWe usually ship in flat cases, two boxes deep, twenty-four pints to a\r\ncrate, which brought us $2.00, $2.25 and $2.50 per crate net, f.o.b.\r\nshipping point.\r\n\r\nThere is but one other berry grower near us, so we do not have much\r\ndifficulty in getting pickers. The first year we built a couple of small\r\ncottages to accommodate people from the city who might care to combine\r\nberry picking with a few days' outing, and it was surprising what a good\r\nclass this proposition appealed to, but we now have enough local pickers\r\nto care for our crop.\r\n\r\nThe profits in raspberry culture vary all the way from little or nothing\r\nabove cost of production up to several hundred dollars per acre,\r\ndepending on the season and how well cared for.\r\n\r\nWhether raspberry culture is a money making proposition or not in a\r\ncommercial way, there certainly is no good reason why every farm or city\r\ngarden should not have at least a few hills of raspberries for home use.\r\nEven leaving the matter of cost out of the question, there is a\r\ndifference between fruit just off the bushes and that which has stood\r\naround in hot, dusty places several hours or longer waiting for a\r\npurchaser. Try it and be convinced!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO INOCULATE SEED.--Coating the seed of legumes with inoculated\r\nsoil before planting is a simple method of insuring soil inoculation at\r\nslight cost. County agents in Illinois have found ordinary furniture\r\nglue effective in holding particles of inoculated soil to the seeds.\r\nThis method gives each individual seed some of the particles of\r\ninoculated soil, which it carries with it when it is planted. The scheme\r\nrequires but a small amount of inoculated soil and costs but a few cents\r\nan acre. The method is described in Farmers' Bulletin 704 of the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nDissolve two handfuls of furniture glue for every gallon of boiling\r\nwater and allow the solution to cool. Put the seed in a washtub and then\r\nsprinkle enough of the solution on the seed to moisten but not to wet it\r\n(one quart per bushel is sufficient) and stir the mixture thoroughly\r\nuntil all the seed are moistened.\r\n\r\nSecure the inoculated soil from a place where the same kind of plants as\r\nthe seed are growing, making sure that the roots have a vigorous\r\ndevelopment of nodules. Dry the soil in the shade, preferably in the\r\nbarn or basement, and pulverize it thoroughly into a dust. Scatter this\r\ndust over the moistened seed, using from one half to one gallon of dirt\r\nfor each bushel of seed, mixing thoroughly until the seed no longer\r\nstick together. The seed are then ready to sow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flower Garden.\r\n\r\n(AN EXERCISE LED BY G. C. HAWKINS, FLORIST, MINNEAPOLIS, AT THE 1915\r\nANNUAL MEETING.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: We have a question box and I would be glad to have any one\r\nuse it or rise and state their question. I will answer, giving my\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe first question I will read is--\"What would you advise about covering\r\nin the garden in a season like this?\" There are now two questions to be\r\nanswered. First, what kind of covering? Second, how much?\r\n\r\nThe first question can be answered this way. Every garden is benefited\r\nby a good covering of well decayed manure. Second. Any light covering of\r\nstraw or horse manure with plenty of straw in it is very good. Leaves\r\nmake a good covering if they can be kept dry, but leaves when not\r\ncovered get wet, pack down over a plant and too often do more damage\r\nthan good. The advantage of covering, or mulching, is to prevent thawing\r\nand freezing. To keep plants frozen from fall until spring would be\r\nideal. The ideal winter is one when the snow falls early and stays on\r\nduring the winter. We should cover lightly the plants that need\r\nprotection, and when the snow falls, as a warm blanket, the plants will\r\ncome through the winter in perfect shape.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: We have a question box and would be glad to have any one\r\nuse it, or rise and ask your question, and we will endeavor to answer it\r\nand give our experience along that line.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: What would you advise for plants that are infected with\r\naphis?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Spraying is one of the best things and for that we use a\r\nweak tobacco solution, so as to moisten the plants, a light mist will do\r\nthe work. I want to tell a little experience in growing peonies. Last\r\nyear I tried the experiment of using ground bone around them, which is\r\none of the best fertilizers we have. It contains nearly all the elements\r\nof a perfect fertilizer. Just as soon as the little joints come out of\r\nthe ground, dig a trench about three inches from the main bush, about\r\ntwo inches deep and fill with ground bone and watch the result. I\r\ncarried this plan out with wonderful success, getting 350 perfect\r\nblossoms on twenty-five bushes. It takes bone about thirty days to\r\ncommence to dissolve. The day of the automobile has brought need for a\r\nnew fertilizer, and we must carefully select the best that can be had.\r\nWe must turn back again to the green crops and the artificial\r\nfertilizers. This also works well with roses.\r\n\r\nMr. Reckstrom: Would bone do that was bought for the chickens?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Yes. You understand the finer the particles the quicker it\r\ncommences to dissolve.\r\n\r\nA Member: Where can ground bone be obtained?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: All first class seedsmen have it from small packages of ten\r\npounds to 100 pound sacks.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell: I tried hardwood ashes, and that seemed to be the best thing I\r\nstruck. There were some shrub lilacs that didn't blossom. One winter I\r\njust put the ashes right on, probably a bushel around the one large\r\nbush. After that I had plenty of blossoms. On peonies and roses the\r\nresult seems to be very good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of G. C. Hawkins, 2913 Fremont Avenue South,\r\nMinneapolis.]\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: No question but what ashes are very fine, for the simple\r\nreason the potash in hardwood ashes is a very good fertilizer. I would\r\nlike to ask some one to give his experience in regard to rust on the\r\ntiger lily and the phlox. The perennial phlox is one of the most\r\nbeautiful flowers we have, and there has been considerable trouble this\r\nyear with a rust which takes all the leaves off the stalk and is\r\ninjurious to the blossoms. I did not find any successful remedy for it,\r\nand I would be very glad if some member would give his experience.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: I think you will find bordeaux mixture is good as anything\r\nfor the rust on phlox. There is another mixture given for use in the\r\nEnglish gardens, but their conditions are not the same as ours. It seems\r\nthat changing the location of the phlox may do it good. Phlox is a plant\r\nthat wants free circulation of air. Sometimes they get crowded in the\r\ngarden, and a combination of heat and moisture produces the rust. By\r\nchanging them to some other ground sometimes it entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Mrs. Sawyer thinks this would be a remedy, as they require\r\na circulation of fresh air and keep down moisture. We know this, phlox\r\nshould be divided every third year. If you lift some you will find in\r\nthe middle a woody dry substance absolutely detrimental to a large,\r\nhealthy growing phlox. If you take off the little plants that come at\r\nthe outside of this and replant them you will find your flowers will be\r\nmuch larger the next year. If we leave bunches of phlox in the same\r\nplace successive years they become small. If you separate them it will\r\nadd vigor to your plant, and the flowers will do better. I would like to\r\nask what success you have had with growing tritoma, the flame flower?\r\nHave you had any difficulty in raising them?\r\n\r\nMrs. Tillotson: I have one blossom that seemed to take such a long time\r\nto get above the ground I wondered what was the matter with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Mrs. Gould, can you give us any enlightenment?\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: I never raised them, I got some bulbs this year. I know you\r\nhave to take them up in the winter and store them like gladiolus, and\r\nthey do not require very heavy soil.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: Will yucca filamentosa ever blossom in a garden in St.\r\nPaul?\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: It will, but it doesn't always. It does blossom in\r\nMinnesota, but I know that people have a great deal of difficulty\r\ngetting blossoms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: I have five plants growing four years and have never\r\nseen a blossom yet.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: I have had two growing three years, and I never have seen\r\nthe color of a blossom yet.\r\n\r\nA Member: What kind is that?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: It is the yucca filamentosa. It is an evergreen. It should\r\nthrow up a tall stalk with large branches and plenty of white flowers, I\r\nthink hundreds of flowers--that is the description. It is a beautiful\r\nthing in the garden anyway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: I have seen them in blossom in California.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I have seen them blossom many times in Winnebago.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: Give us the culture instructions.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: I grew in nursery rows some odd stuff, had the same\r\nculture that the nursery had. But when it blossomed one year I have been\r\ntold on good authority it would be five years before that stalk would\r\nblossom again, only blossoms once in five years, but by having many\r\nstalks they don't all blossom at the same time. I have had them two or\r\nthree years in succession but not on the same stalk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: Do you cover them winters?\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson: Never.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: I think the only reason why the yucca filamentosa doesn't\r\ndo well is because it is a plant of the southwest and grows in a warmer\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: I had a varied experience in growing those plants, and I\r\ntook a great deal of pains to learn all I could from different sources\r\nand different people, and I believe our trouble is our late frosts, I\r\nthink that is conceded by people who have really gone into the question\r\nthoroughly. Our late frosts injure them more than anything else. A\r\nlittle protection in the spring is what they need more than protection\r\nin winter, and we know that they don't want a wet place.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: I want to recommend a flower that should be very popular.\r\nIt is perfectly hardy, blossoms for years, the hardy pyrethrum. It is a\r\ndaisy-like flower, absolutely free from insects and a sure bloomer. We\r\nhave plants in the garden that have bloomed six years. It comes in many\r\nshades, from white to deep crimson, blooms from the 15th of May to the\r\n1st of July and makes a beautiful showing. In regard to iris, did any\r\none have any trouble with their iris coming a little ahead of time last\r\nyear and being frozen?\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: I guess they all froze off. I don't think it was because\r\nthey were ahead of time; it was because of the frost.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: What would you recommend?\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: I don't think there is anything to do in weather like last\r\nspring, you can't cover anything away from a hard black frost like that\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. C. Hawkins, of Minneapolis.]\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: We have several hundred plants on a southern slope, and I\r\nthought perhaps the sun beating against the southern slope is what\r\nstarted them earlier.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sawyer: Ours weren't on a southern slope, pretty near level, rather\r\nnorth than anything else, and they got frozen.\r\n\r\nA Member: What causes the rot in the iris?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: That depends upon the kind of iris. With the bulbous rooted\r\niris, the bulb is filled full of water during the heavy rains, and if\r\nyou add more water to it it simply decays. The Siberian and many of the\r\nfibrous rooted iris will stand a great deal of water.\r\n\r\nA Member: Does the German?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: The German is a bulbous root. As I said, it takes all the\r\nmoisture it needs. That is one reason why iris never wilts down in a dry\r\nspell. It always looks fresh and green.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to say it is well not to plant the iris deep. The\r\nnatural iris will lie almost on top of the ground, and they like to have\r\nthe sun beat down on them. The iris likes to bask in the sun.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: This would prove to you that the bulb takes enough water to\r\nsupport it and doesn't need any more because it rests on the top and\r\nbasks in the sun. Has any one tried anything new in the garden that will\r\nstand our climate?\r\n\r\nMrs. Norton: I would suggest that hardy alum-root, or heuchera. It is a\r\nperfectly hardy perennial, can stand our worst winters without any\r\ncovering, and it grows about so high from the ground (indicating two or\r\nthree feet), with its geranium-like leaves, and the flower grows about\r\nthree feet high, all covered with pink bells on the stems. It is a very\r\ndecorative plant and perfectly hardy. I think it has been much neglected\r\nin the Northwest because it is so perfectly hardy and it increases very\r\nrapidly. I have over one hundred.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: I would like Mrs. Gibbs to say a word.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gibbs: The only thing I can say is that I enjoy being around among\r\nother people's gardens. I think that is one of the best places to find\r\nout things that we want; so many times we buy something that sounds\r\nwell, but when we have it planted it doesn't look as well. I think one\r\nof the best ways is to visit gardens and especially those that use\r\nlabels.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask about the trollius.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Has any one had experience in raising trollius?\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: I have had experience in not raising them. I planted three\r\nyears, and after getting the seeds from all the seedsmen I discovered in\r\na book on plants that the seed would have to be in the ground two years\r\nin order to germinate. I didn't know that and left them in only a few\r\nmonths. I think the only way is to buy the plants. It is a very\r\nbeautiful plant, yellow and shaped like golden glow, belongs to the same\r\nfamily as the buttercup.\r\n\r\nA Member: I would like to ask about the hollyhocks. I saw such beautiful\r\nhollyhocks around Lake Minnetonka and I have never been able to make\r\nthem winter. I would like to ask about that.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: We have three plants, hollyhocks, digitalis and canterbury\r\nbells, and nearly all have the same trouble with them. If we mulch them\r\nwe are liable to have the center decay and the plants practically\r\nuseless. It is a question of mulching them too much or not mulching\r\nthem. I would like to have you speak up and tell us your experience. I\r\nhave in mind a gentleman who raises splendid hollyhocks in the\r\nneighborhood of the lakes. Takes no care of them, and yet he had one\r\nthis year seventeen feet high, which took care of itself and had any\r\namount of blossoms. I tried that experiment several years myself of\r\nmulching them, and the crown rotted. These are three of the best flowers\r\nof the garden, and we ought to have some certain way of keeping them.\r\n\r\nA Member: Have you ever tried mulching them with corn stalks?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: Yes, I have tried it but lost them.\r\n\r\nA Member: I had very good luck with them that way.\r\n\r\nA Member: It is more a question of drainage than of mulching.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: That might be.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: I wish simply to say that the trouble with winter grown\r\nhollyhocks and canterbury bells is that they will head so tall and must\r\nbe kept dry. I always cover the hollyhocks and if I had the others I\r\nthink I would cover them. I uncover mine early in the spring, and if it\r\ngets cold put on a little more straw. You are almost sure to uncover\r\nthem the wrong time. With foxgloves I think it is almost unnecessary to\r\ncover them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: In our gardens the hollyhocks form one of the best\r\nbackgrounds we can have, beautiful, tall, stately stalks, and the\r\ncanterbury bells, certainly nothing more beautiful than they. Then we\r\ncome to the other, the digitalis, which is equally as beautiful. We must\r\ngive our attention to the protection and growth of these in years to\r\ncome because they are three of the beautiful things of the garden. It\r\nhas been suggested that digitalis be potted and put inside the cold\r\nframe and leaves put over them. I think leaves are a splendid protection\r\nif you can keep them dry. If I were using them as a mulch I would keep\r\nout the water by covering with roofing paper to keep them dry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: I am told on good authority that the hollyhock is a\r\ntrue perennial and not a biennial.\r\n\r\nMrs. White: It is listed in the foreign catalogs as both a perennial and\r\na biennial.\r\n\r\nMrs. Countryman: Wouldn't the hollyhock come under the heading of being\r\nperennial but not a permanent perennial?\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: It might be classed that way. There seems to be a\r\ndifference of opinion as to just what it is. I have known them to come\r\nsix or seven years in the same spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTIE TRAP FOR RABBITS.--An inexpensive and permanent sewer tile\r\ntrap for cottontail rabbits has proved very effective in Kansas. To make\r\nthe trap, proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Set a 12 by 6-inch 'T' sewer tile with the long end downward, and bury\r\nit so that the 6-inch opening at the side is below the surface of the\r\nground. Connect two lengths of 6-inch sewer pipe horizontally with the\r\nside opening. Second grade or even broken tile will do. Cover the joints\r\nwith soil so as to exclude light. Provide a tight removable cover, such\r\nas an old harrow disk, for the top of the large tile. The projecting end\r\nof the small tile is then surrounded with rocks, brush, or wood, so as\r\nto make the hole look inviting to rabbits and encourage them to frequent\r\nthe den. Rabbits, of course, are free to go in or out of these dens,\r\nwhich should be constructed in promising spots on the farm and in the\r\norchard. A trained dog will locate inhabited dens. The outlet is closed\r\nwith a disk of wood on a stake, or the dog guards the opening. The cover\r\nis lifted and the rabbits captured by hand.\r\n\r\n\"These traps are especially suitable for open lands and prairies, where\r\nrabbits cannot find natural hiding places. They are permanent and cost\r\nnothing for repairs from year to year. If it is desired to poison\r\nrabbits, the baits may be placed inside these traps, out of the way of\r\ndomestic animals or birds. This trap also furnishes an excellent means\r\nof obtaining rabbits for the table, or even for market.\"--U.S. Dept. of\r\nAgri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlueberry Culture.\r\n\r\nU.S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlueberries thrive best on soils which are so acid that they are usually\r\nconsidered almost worthless for ordinary agricultural purposes.\r\nBlueberry culture, therefore, offers possibilities of profit to\r\nindividual land-owners in districts in which the general conditions are\r\nespecially hard and unpromising. Blueberries can not be grown in\r\nordinary fertile soils.\r\n\r\nAlthough frequently confused, especially in the South and in the Middle\r\nWest, blueberries and huckleberries are quite distinct. In New England\r\nthe name \"huckleberry\" is restricted to berries which contain 10 large\r\nseeds with bony coverings like minute peach pits which crackle between\r\nthe teeth, while the name \"blueberry\" is applied to various species of\r\nberries containing many but very small seeds. It is the latter, not the\r\nlarge-seeded huckleberry, which offers possibilities for profitable\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nAt the present stage of the blueberry industry it is best to begin by\r\ntransplanting the most promising wild bushes, selecting them for the\r\nsize, flavor, color and earliness of the berry as well as for the vigor\r\nand productiveness of the bush. These plants can be propagated in\r\nvarious ways, which are described in detail in a professional paper of\r\nthe department, Bulletin No. 334, by Frederick V. Coville. The aim of\r\nthe cultivator should be to secure bushes which will produce large\r\nberries. These cost less to pick than small ones and bring a higher\r\nprice on the market. A berry eleven-sixteenths of an inch in diameter\r\nhas already been produced under field culture.\r\n\r\nThe three fundamental requirements for successful blueberry culture are:\r\n(1) An acid soil, especially one composed of peat and sand; (2) good\r\ndrainage and thorough aeration of the surface soil; and (3) permanent\r\nbut moderate soil moisture. Next in importance to these essentials is a\r\nlocation such that the berries may reach the market without delay. The\r\nbest prices are obtained about the beginning of the wild blueberry\r\nseason. The main crop of wild blueberries comes from northern New\r\nEngland, Canada and northern Michigan. A location to the south of these\r\nareas where the berries will mature earlier is, therefore, to be desired\r\nfor the commercial cultivator. One of the most promising districts now\r\nknown is the cranberry region of New Jersey, where berries mature early\r\nand the shipping facilities to the market in Philadelphia, New York and\r\nBoston are good.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor to be considered in selecting a location for a\r\nblueberry patch is the possibility of late spring freezes. For this\r\nreason the bottoms of valleys should be avoided. Freezing seldom injures\r\nthe blueberry plant itself, but the fruit crop is often destroyed in\r\nthis way. From past observations it appears that wild blueberries\r\ngrowing in or around bodies of water frequently escape the injurious\r\neffects of late spring freezes, and it seems, therefore, that a flooding\r\nequipment for blueberry plantations similar to those used for cranberry\r\nbogs may, under certain circumstances, prove commercially advantageous.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, however, only a beginning has been made in\r\nblueberry culture. The yield and profits in field plantations from\r\nimproved bushes have not as yet been ascertained. There is, however, one\r\nsmall planting in Indiana where complete records have been maintained\r\nfor the past six years. This plantation was started in 1889 in a natural\r\nblueberry bog, which was first drained and then set with wild blueberry\r\nbushes transplanted without selection for individual productiveness or\r\nsize of berries. On this plantation the yield per acre has averaged\r\n1,741 quarts for the past six years. This average would have been\r\nsomewhat higher except for the almost total failure of the crop in 1910,\r\ndue to late spring freezes. An average of 14-1/2 cents a quart has been\r\nreceived for the berries and the net profit per acre is estimated at\r\n$116 a year. In this estimate allowance has been made for interest,\r\ntaxes and depreciation. The expense for weeding, cultivation, and\r\nirrigation is placed at $20 an acre and the cost of picking at five\r\ncents a quart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOMEMADE FIRELESS COOKER.--A wooden or tin pail, lined with two\r\nthicknesses of paper and provided with a close-fitting cover, may be\r\nused for the outside container of the cooker. Allow for three inches of\r\npacking on all sides and at the bottom of the pail. A gallon oyster can\r\nwill serve very well for the nest, which should be wrapped on the\r\noutside next to the packing with asbestos and a piece of asbestos placed\r\nunder the bottom to prevent the scorching of the packing when hot\r\nsoapstones are used. Shredded newspaper and excelsior make a good\r\npacking. Pack this very tightly around and to the top of the nest, the\r\ntop of which should be about three inches below the lid of the outside\r\ncontainer. A piece of cardboard cut to fit inside the lard can with a\r\ncircle cut out of the center around the top of the oyster can or nest\r\nwill hide the packing and make a neat finish. Place a three-inch cushion\r\nof unbleached muslin, stuffed tightly with excelsior, on top of the lid\r\nof the nest. When the top of the outside container is placed on and\r\nhooked down, it will be tight enough to cause a pressure. If a tin pail\r\nis used for the outside container, it may be enameled white, or a wooden\r\npail stained brown, making a neat-looking appliance for any kitchen.\r\nRegular aluminum fireless-cooker utensils may be used for cooking the\r\nfood in the nest, but any kind of a vessel with a close-fitting top and\r\none that fits closely in the nest is suitable.--U.S. Dept. Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHardy Perennials.\r\n\r\nMISS GRACE E. KIMBALL, WALTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been very little in my work with hardy perennials that seems\r\nworth relating. For many years, in Austin, we had iris, peonies and\r\nphlox in our garden. While my love for flowers and outdoor work led me\r\nto spend all my time, outside of office hours, in the garden, the iris\r\nand peonies, especially, never gave any trouble but grew and blossomed\r\nin the most approved fashion. With the phlox we have had more trouble,\r\nsometimes in dry seasons not getting the bloom we should, and finally,\r\nthe last year we were there, losing nearly all the roots we had. I am\r\nnow inclined to think that had we divided and transplanted them some\r\nyears before, we would not have lost them.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few years ago that I began to realize that herbaceous\r\nperennials could, with success, be planted in the fall in our climate,\r\nand it was not until two years ago that I made any attempt at fall\r\nplanting. That year I was quite successful, but last year, wishing to\r\ndivide as close as possible, especially with the iris, I evidently\r\noverdid the matter, with the result that I lost many of my plants.\r\nHowever, I learned my lesson, and this year they were not divided so\r\nclosely, and I am hoping that they will come through the winter all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nWith the hardy perennials easily raised from seed my first experience\r\nwas with the oriental poppy. I had greatly desired to have some in the\r\ngarden and, not knowing that the fall was the time to plant them,\r\nordered some one spring. They failed to grow, so the next year I\r\nattempted to raise them from seed, starting them in the house as I did\r\nmy pansy seed. But I was far from successful in that way, and having\r\nread some articles on the difficulty of raising them from seed, also\r\nlearning that they should be set out in the fall, I made up my mind they\r\nwere not worth bothering with.\r\n\r\nHowever, father suggested I might succeed by planting the seed in the\r\nshade out of doors, and even though it was quite late in the summer I\r\ngot more seed and sowed it broadcast in a hedge of lilacs, syringas and\r\nso forth, kept the ground moist, and in a short time had many plants\r\ncoming up. I also had ordered a few to be shipped me in the fall.\r\n\r\nBy fall my seedlings were large enough to be transplanted into boxes, to\r\nbe moved as we were moving from Austin to Waltham. With those I had\r\nordered for fall delivery, they were moved to our new place, the boxes\r\nsunk in the ground, and the next spring put into a hedge with other\r\nplants--for while they do not stand transportation very well in the\r\nspring, I have been successful in transplanting them from one part of\r\nour grounds to another at that season.\r\n\r\nSince coming to Waltham I have started the seeds of the poppy, larkspur,\r\ncolumbine and gaillardia in a grove near the house, where they are\r\neasily kept moist. If I get the seed in early in the spring, the plants\r\nare often large enough to transplant in the fall. However I like better\r\nto plant the seed later, about the time the first blossoms from each\r\nvariety have ripened their seed. The seedlings will then be large enough\r\nto withstand the winter with a little protection and ready for spring\r\ntransplanting.\r\n\r\nWith a comparatively small amount of work, and very ordinary care, once\r\nthe plants are set out anyone can have continuous bloom from early\r\nspring until frosts come, by setting iris, peonies, phlox, columbine,\r\npoppies, larkspur, gaillardia, giant daisy and painted daisy. Such a\r\nselection would make a big variety of color and form in the garden, and\r\nall but the first three kinds can be very easily raised from seed. Or\r\nnot wishing so many kinds, one can have flowers all summer by a careful\r\nselection of several varieties of iris, peonies and phlox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Should We Grow Seedling Apples?\r\n\r\nISAAC JOHNSON, WEST UNION, IA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no work in fruit growing that has more taken my attention and\r\ngiven me more pleasure than the growing of seedling apples. For many\r\nyears I have been of the opinion that apples for this severe climate\r\nmust be grown from seed. If we succeed in growing hardy, productive and\r\ngood keeping varieties, they must be native, or raised at home. By\r\nexperimental work along in this line of growing fruit we have come to\r\nthis conclusion that fruit trees do best grow at home.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the list of apples we grow this far north, we all know\r\nthat the hardiest and the most productive kind are seedlings, either\r\nfrom Minnesota, Iowa or Wisconsin. Minnesota has the Wealthy, the banner\r\napple; for early and late fall apple it has no equal. Wisconsin has the\r\nNorthwestern Greening and the Wolf River, which are very large, showy\r\nand good market apples. We all know what Mr. Patten has done along in\r\nthis line of growing seedlings.\r\n\r\nAt the state horticultural meeting in Des Moines, December last, was\r\nexhibited one hundred varieties of seedlings and a large number of\r\nthose, to my judgment, were good keepers and fine looking apples.\r\nHundreds and hundreds of varieties of apples have been imported from\r\nRussia, and I for one have tested fifty or sixty of those Russian\r\nvarieties, but at the state meeting, where I exhibited seventy-seven\r\nvarieties, I was able to show only three Russian varieties, Longfield,\r\nAntinovka and Volga Cross. I think I have reason to ask what would we\r\nhave for apples today if there had not been any seedlings raised? Why\r\ndoes the State of Minnesota offer one thousand dollars for a seedling\r\napple tree that is as hardy as the Duchess with fruit as good as the\r\nWealthy and that keeps as well as the Malinda? Because to get such a\r\nvariety it must come from seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting for Color Effects in the Garden.\r\n\r\nMRS. H. B. TILLOTSON, MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most attractive flower bed in my garden this year has been the one\r\nplanted for a blue and white effect. From earliest spring, soon after\r\nthe snow had gone, until now, October 4th, there has been something\r\ninteresting and beautiful blooming there.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the summer it was one tangled mass of lilies,\r\ndelphinium, phlox and gypsophila, their perfume filling the whole\r\ngarden. As the lilies faded and the delphinium grew old and went to\r\nseed, the old stalks were cut away. The phlox and delphinium bloomed\r\nagain in a little while, and in September the candidum lilies began to\r\ncome through the ground, getting ready for next year.\r\n\r\nThe bed is three feet wide by thirty long, and was covered last winter\r\nwith loose straw and leaves, with a few cornstalks to hold them in\r\nplace. Early in April this was raked off and the edges of the bed made\r\nstraight, for the grass always grows in a little each year. The warm\r\nsunshine soon brought out the scilla and crocus, almost carpeting the\r\nwhole bed. One would not think of the other things hiding under their\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe forget-me-nots began to look green along the edge, and up through\r\nthe fading crocus and scilla came a few straggling grape hyacinths, blue\r\nand white, and one lonely plant of the Virginia cowslip\r\n(Mertensia)--more could have been used with good effect, for they too\r\ndisappear after awhile.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia cowslip staid in bloom until the forget-me-nots were a\r\nmass of blossoms, and the blue Darwin tulips (pink, really, with a blue\r\nspot in the bottom of the cup, just back of them) were in all their\r\nglory. In the middle of the bed the Madonna lilies, and belladona\r\ndelphinium had covered the ground with green. In spots the wild violets\r\nwere in blossom--they had crept in some way from the dirt--I think it\r\nhad been taken from the woods near by.\r\n\r\nWatching each day, for the friends I knew would soon be coming, I found\r\nthe first shoots of the hardy phlox, which I knew to be G. Von Losburg\r\nand Miss Lingard. Double blue bachelor buttons, self sown, were there,\r\nsome transplanted to fill in the bare spots, and poppies; I didn't know\r\nwhat color they would be, for the wind and the birds had sown the seed;\r\nbut the leaves were a beautiful grey-green, and I let them grow. I had\r\nalmost given up the double baby breath (gypsophila paniculata, fl. pl.),\r\nbut finally it came all the way down the bed, about every five or six\r\nfeet, between the delphinium and the phlox. There were perhaps a dozen\r\nplants of phlox, a dozen of belladona delphinium and six baby breath\r\nthrough the middle of the bed, and on each side a row of the intense\r\nblue Chinese delphinium.\r\n\r\nJust outside these, and next to the forget-me-nots and tulips, are the\r\nbachelor buttons, and, coming through it all, a hundred candidum lilies,\r\ntheir waxy white blossoms glistening in the sunshine, and the perfume so\r\nheavy you knew they were there long before you could see them. The\r\npoppies, too, were there; they were double, like a peony, rose-pink with\r\na white edge. I was glad I let them grow, for I don't think I ever saw a\r\nmore beautiful sight.\r\n\r\nI let it all grow and bloom as long as it would, hating to touch it for\r\nfear of spoiling all. Finally I was obliged to clear away the old\r\nstalks, and it looked rather bare for a time. But I brought some white\r\nasters from the reserve garden. The Baron Hulot gladoli were soon in\r\nbloom. The phlox sent up tiny shoots for new bloom from the base of each\r\nleaf, and the second crop of bachelor buttons came along. White\r\nschizanthus along the edge, covered up the old forget-me-nots, and\r\nfunkia lilies (subcordata) threw up their buds. The delphinium all began\r\nto bloom again, the grey-green leaves of the baby breath was still\r\nthere, and soon my bed was all abloom again and staid so the rest of the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nBut never did it equal the glory of those first ten days of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fall-Bearing Strawberries.\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. GARDNER, NURSERYMAN, OSAGE, IA.\r\n\r\n(SO. MINN. HORT. SOCIETY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are now such excellent varieties of fall bearing strawberries on\r\nthe market that a person can have no good excuse for not planting some\r\nin his garden. Select the ground for the bed where you will get the\r\nwhole benefit from the rays of the sun. I want no trees, bushes, or tall\r\ngrowing plants of any kind near the bed. The farther away, the better.\r\n\r\nThe earth should be made quite rich with well rotted compost. I like the\r\nplan of preparing the bed a long time before you get ready to set your\r\nplants. You can then work the soil over, time after time, and every time\r\nkill a crop of weeds. More plants are set in the spring than any other\r\ntime, but they will grow and do well if set in midsummer or any time\r\nafter that up to the middle of October. Get through setting in September\r\nif you can. If you set later, in October, cover the plants with a slight\r\ncovering of straw as soon as planted. Then afterwards, when you make a\r\nbusiness of covering put on a little more, cover them nicely--but you\r\nare liable to kill them if you put on too much. Two inches deep I find\r\nto be about the right depth to go through our ordinary winters. I mean\r\ntwo inches after the straw has settled. I think many persons spoil their\r\nplants, or at least injure them severely, by putting on too heavy a coat\r\nof covering. I will also tell you to beware of using horse-manure as a\r\ncovering for strawberries. Clean straw or hay is the best of covering.\r\n(Fall planting of strawberries not advisable in Minnesota.--Secy.)\r\n\r\nMost people do not trim the plants enough before they are set. All fruit\r\nstems should be cut off, if there are any, and the most of the old\r\nleaves removed, two or three of the youngest leaves on the plant is all\r\nthat should be left. These will start right off into a vigorous growth,\r\nand you will soon have strong, healthy plants. I think it pays to put a\r\nsmall handful of tobacco dust on and around each hill. You can generally\r\nget it at your nearest greenhouse--or you can find out there where to\r\nsend for it. Get enough to put it on two or three times during the early\r\nand latter part of summer.\r\n\r\nDo not select ground for your new bed that has been in strawberries;\r\ntake ground that has never had strawberries on, or at least that two or\r\nthree crops of some kind have been taken from it since it was covered\r\nwith strawberry vines.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants are set, they should be well firmed; it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that they should be very solid in the earth. They should not\r\nbe too deep nor too shallow, one is as bad as the other. The crown buds\r\nshould be in plain sight, after the ground is firmed and leveled, just\r\nin sight and no more. A little temporary hilling will do no harm, but\r\nthe ground should be kept as level as possible. All cultivation should\r\nbe shallow so as to not disturb the roots of the plants. This is also a\r\nvery important item. Just remember that every plant loosened after it is\r\nset means death to the plant if it is not reset at once. Cultivate often\r\nwhen the ground is not too wet. Keep your bed entirely free of grass and\r\nweeds. This is easily done if all work is done when it should be. The\r\ntime to kill weeds is when the seed first sprouts; don't wait until the\r\nweed plants are an inch or more high; if you do you will never keep them\r\nclean, and then you will never have success in your work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chas. F. Gardner at work in his everbearing strawberry\r\nexperiment grounds.]\r\n\r\nCut all fruit stems off as fast as they appear, until your plants get\r\nwell rooted, and then let them bear as much as they want to. But if some\r\nplants set an unusually large number it is well to cut out part of the\r\nfruit. If rightly thinned you will increase the yield in quarts.\r\n\r\nIf fruit is the main object, after the plants are well located and begin\r\nto set fruit for your main crop, they can be mulched with clean straw or\r\nhay, carefully tucked up around each hill. This will keep the fruit\r\nclean and conserve the moisture in the soil, and you can stop\r\ncultivating. If plants are the main object, then you can not use the\r\nmulching, but must keep the cultivator going between the rows. Well\r\ninformed growers of the strawberry plant generally have beds on purpose\r\nfor fruit in one place, and in another place one to grow plants.\r\n\r\nNo one will make a success in growing strawberries unless he can learn\r\nto detect the rogues that appear from time to time in strawberry patches\r\nor in the fields. These rogues are generally plants that have come up\r\nfrom the seed that has been scattered in one way and another over the\r\nbed. Berries are stepped on and mashed, other berries are overlooked and\r\nrot on the ground, but the seed remain and germinate when the time comes\r\nfor it in the spring, and some of these plants are not destroyed by\r\ncultivation or by hoeing, and soon make trouble for the grower. No\r\nseedling will be like the original plants that were first set, and many\r\nof them will be strong growing plants, good runners but worthless for\r\nfruit. When you set a new lot of plants you get some of these seedlings,\r\nand that is how the mixture comes in. I have counted one hundred and\r\nfifty seedling plants around one old plant in the spring. Of course the\r\nmost of these where good tillage is practised are destroyed, but some\r\nremain in spite of all you can do unless you pay the very closest\r\nattention and learn to distinguish rogues from the true named varieties.\r\nAll rogues must be kept out if you keep the variety true to name. Of\r\ncourse once in a while a rogue will prove to be a valuable variety, as\r\nwas the case when Mr. Cooper found the Pan American eighteen years ago,\r\nfrom which our fall varieties owe their parentage. If you want to be\r\nsuccessful remember to keep in mind the value of constant selection and\r\nkeeping your parent stock true to name.\r\n\r\nWhen you first set out your plants, go over them and examine them\r\nclosely and see that everything is right. Then remember that the first\r\nsign of a good fall bearing variety is to see it throw out fruit stalks.\r\nYou can cut these off, so that the stub of the fruit stem will show that\r\nit has sent up a flower stalk. You can see the stub. In this way in a\r\nsmall patch you can easily keep track of them. If some plants do not\r\nthrow out fruit stems, mark them so you can tell them, and if they pass\r\nthe season without trying to fruit, you must refrain from setting out\r\nany of the runners that appear, or there is liability of trouble. Let\r\nsuch plants alone for another year's trial. Then if they do no better,\r\ndig them up and destroy them. Once in a while they prove to be all\r\nright, but often they are worthless.\r\n\r\nLearn to tell a variety by a careful examination of the plant at\r\ndifferent times during the season. Fix the general color of the leaf in\r\nyour mind, its shape and size. Notice whether the fruit stems are long\r\nor short, whether the blossoms are above the leaves, in plain sight, or\r\nare hidden below. Are there many fruit buds to the stalk, or but few?\r\nAre the blossoms pistillate or staminate? Are the petals large or small?\r\nAre the stamens long or short? Are the anthers well or poorly formed?\r\nThey should be plump and well filled before they are ready to open.\r\n\r\nIs the receptacle on which the pistils sit well formed and capable of\r\nbeing developed into a perfect berry, or do they look ungainly in shape?\r\nAre the petals pure white or slightly crimson? Are there many runners,\r\nor few, or none? Do the new runners bear blossoms and fruit? If so, when\r\ndo they commence to bud and bloom? When do the berries begin to ripen?\r\nNotice the size and shape of the fruit, also the color. You can tell\r\nmuch from the taste of the berry. No two varieties taste exactly alike.\r\nSome are real sweet and some kinds real sour. Then there are all grades\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nThe perfume, or fragrance, of the fruit of the common strawberry when\r\nfully ripened under proper conditions of sunlight and moisture has long\r\nbeen esteemed and highly appreciated by mankind in general, and in this\r\nrespect the fall-bearing strawberry varies greatly. The most of the\r\nvarieties excel all common kinds as to perfume and that delicate\r\nstrawberry flavor which nearly everybody loves so well. Once in a while\r\na musk-scented variety is developed, like the Milo on our grounds, which\r\nas yet has never been sent out. By paying close attention to these\r\nthings you can soon learn to distinguish many varieties at any time\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Mr. Cooper found his seedling which he called the Pan American.\r\nFrom that small beginning there are now many varieties, perhaps\r\nthousands, that excel the parent plant, and perhaps a hundred varieties\r\nof great value. Some varieties have very superior merit. I will mention\r\na few: Progressive, Peerless, Advance, Danville, Forward, Prince, Will,\r\nMilo, Nathaniel, 480, and there are others which might be mentioned.\r\nGood reports have reached me of kinds produced at your Horticultural\r\nExperiment farm by Prof. Haralson, but I have never tried them. My\r\nprivate opinion is that several kinds I have not mentioned will very\r\nsoon take a back seat, as the saying is. The best varieties are bound to\r\ncome to the front.\r\n\r\nThe best advertisement one can have is the ability to ship thousands of\r\nquarts during the whole autumn. This season we shipped 22,565 quarts,\r\nmostly sold in pint boxes. They netted us from 12-1/2 to 18 cents per\r\npint. At home we kept them on the market during the whole season at 15\r\ncents per quart. We lost as many as 5,000 quarts by violent storms\r\nduring the season. It was a fair season for growing plants, but there\r\nwas too much water to grow the best of fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity in Gladioli.\r\n\r\nG. D. BLACK, GLADIOLUS SPECIALIST, INDEPENDENCE, IA.\r\n\r\n(SO. MINN. HORT. SOCIETY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs heredity is a comparatively new word, it may be well to define it at\r\nthe beginning of this paper. Webster says \"It is the transmission of\r\nmental or physical characteristics or qualities from parent to\r\noffspring, the tendency of an organism to reproduce the characteristics\r\nof the progenitor.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the species of gladioli are native in the temperate zone of\r\nSouthern Africa, where they have grown for so long a time that they will\r\nreproduce themselves in a marked degree from seeds.\r\n\r\nSome have grown in the moist soils of the valleys for so many\r\ngenerations that they have become adapted to these conditions and will\r\nnot thrive on the elevated plateaus and mountain slopes. Those which are\r\nnative in the higher and cooler altitudes will not grow well in the\r\nlower lands.\r\n\r\nA species or variety becomes acclimated when it is grown in one locality\r\nfor several successive generations, because it is one of nature's laws\r\nthat it takes on new characteristics that improve it for existence\r\nthere. These characters are changing more or less during each generation\r\non account of environment.\r\n\r\nWe can not aid nature in strengthening and improving the desirable\r\nqualities unless we follow nature's laws. By crossing two varieties that\r\nhave certain desirable characters in common we may be able to make these\r\ncharacteristics more dominant.\r\n\r\nMuch of the crossbreeding of the gladiolus has been done in such an\r\nunscientific manner that it is surprising that so much improvement has\r\nbeen made. This improvement is mostly the result of extra care and\r\ncultivation, and the selection of the best each generation. In order to\r\nretain the benefit of any extra care and cultivation it has to pass on\r\nas a heritage to the succeeding generation and is there incorporated\r\namong its characteristics. Each generation should be an advance toward\r\nthe desired ideal.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the ruffling and doubling of the\r\npetals in flowers that have been under cultivation for several\r\ngenerations is caused by the extra feeding and care that they have\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nMost species of gladioli in their wild state are small and lacking in\r\nbeauty. Abnormal or freak varieties should not be selected as the best\r\nfor breeding, because they are usually the result of a violent cross,\r\nand are nearly always weak as propagators and sometimes entirely\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nPrinceps has a very large flower, but the spike is short and only two or\r\nthree blooms are open at one time. It was originated by Dr. Van Fleet by\r\ncrossing Mrs. Beecher and Cruentus. Burbank crossed Princeps and\r\nAmerica, and quite a number of the seedlings show the markings of Mrs.\r\nBeecher, one of their grandparents, but with shorter spikes. In this\r\ncross Princeps transmits the undesirable character of short spikes but\r\nleaves out the abnormal size of flower, and the best characters of\r\nAmerica are lacking. The parentage of America is very much in doubt, as\r\nthree prominent gladiolus breeders claim the honor of originating it.\r\n\r\nThere are many characteristics to be considered when making selections\r\nfor breeding besides the color and size of the flower. The bulbs of some\r\nvarieties will stand considerable freezing while other varieties will\r\nnot. This same characteristic is noticed in the foliage. The severe\r\nfrost that killed our corn crop on August 30th so impaired Panama,\r\nHiawatha and some others that very few blooms of these varieties opened\r\nafterwards. The foliage of some varieties remained green after a\r\ntemperature of twelve degrees below freezing.\r\n\r\nA representative of a Holland bulb growing firm who called on me a few\r\ndays ago says that Niagara is a very weak grower in Holland and Panama\r\nis a very vigorous grower. My experience with these varieties is just\r\nthe reverse. This seems to show that sometimes the difference in climate\r\nmay cause certain characters in the plant to act differently--if the\r\nHollander is not mistaken.\r\n\r\nA few varieties are sometimes subject to blight and rust. Some are only\r\nslightly affected, and many others are entirely blight proof.\r\n\r\nThere are so many characteristics to be considered by the scientific\r\nbreeder that it is almost impossible to enumerate them all in this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a great work to be done in breeding out the undesirable\r\ntraits and incorporating the improvements which we desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCivic Improvement.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALBERTSON, PRES. CIVIC IMPROVEMENT LEAGUE, AUSTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a subject so broad and so closely connected with \"The City\r\nBeautiful\" one can hardly find a starting point, but we might begin with\r\nthe one word--civic--which has drawn to itself many minds, much sober\r\nthought and from some much hard work.\r\n\r\nThe fear was widespread that woman would work havoc if she attempted to\r\nspell the task, but how needless, for the word civic can be spelled with\r\naccuracy from whichever end approached.\r\n\r\nWhat was the beginning of the civic league and the city beautiful? It\r\nbegan at home, where most women's work begins. To have a beautiful home\r\none must have the right kind of house. To have the beautiful house to\r\nmake the beautiful home the setting must be made to correspond--so after\r\nthe house, the lawn; after the lawn, the boulevard. Then the work\r\nspread. Streets needed cleaning, unsightly billboards had to be removed,\r\nperhaps an adjoining vacant lot had a careless owner whose pride needed\r\npricking. So the need of a civic league grew, and now it has become a\r\nvital spark in many cities all over the Union. Minnesota has over thirty\r\ncivic clubs doing specific work. Is it entirely the work for women? No.\r\nIs it entirely the work for men? No. It is a work for both. It is a work\r\nthat is very contagious and a contagion that needs no quarantine.\r\n\r\nCivic league work envelopes many lines of improvement. Streets and\r\nalleys sometimes need to be reported to the proper committee of the city\r\ncouncil; the disposal of rubbish and garbage has confronted many civic\r\nsocieties. There is nothing so conducive to unsanitary conditions and so\r\ndisfiguring to a beautiful street as glimpses and often broad views of\r\nalleys and back yards that have become dump piles and garbage receivers.\r\n\r\nBesides the effect on one's love for cleanliness and beauty, it breeds\r\ndisease--and so public sanitation was added to the civic league work.\r\n\r\nIn some cities the societies are taking up the work of smoke abatement.\r\nI might say that we have a few offending chimneys in our own city\r\nbeautiful. Every member of the city council should be a member of the\r\ncivic league, for much more could be done by co-operation. There is\r\ngreat need of the civic improvement league and park board working\r\ntogether, for their aim is one--to make the city beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe work that gives the most beauty to the city after the good\r\nfoundation of cleanliness, public sanitation and removal of public\r\nnuisances is that done in the parks. I am glad cities are making larger\r\nappropriations for parks, and I hope our city will have more in the\r\nfuture, for there are great possibilities of making our city not only a\r\ncity beautiful, but a most beautiful city. Parks should be well lighted,\r\nplaygrounds for children are almost a necessity, the river banks should\r\nbe kept clean--but most of all the natural beauties of a place must be\r\npreserved and trees should be planted. Shade is needed as a good\r\nbackground. There is nothing that will enhance a beautiful statue,\r\nfountain or other park ornament like a setting of good trees.\r\n\r\nIf possible to have it there is no more attractive spot in a park than a\r\nlily pool. The old idea of laying out parks according to some\r\ngeometrical pattern is giving way to the development of walk lines of\r\npractical use, recognizing both traffic requirements and the\r\ndesirability of location for numerous park benches. What will lend more\r\ncharm to a park than a beautiful drive bordered with noble trees leading\r\nup to some focal point or opening a way to some particular vista that\r\nwould otherwise be lost!\r\n\r\nThe park board should not limit its work to parks alone, but wherever\r\nthere is a spot, triangle corner or any other kind of available place,\r\nthere should be planted shrubs or flower beds. They soon become a public\r\npride and cheer many passersby. We have a number of bright spots in our\r\ncity, beginning in the spring with a beautiful bed of tulips. May\r\nanother year bring us many more! One forgets the mud and the\r\ndisagreeable days of spring in watching the bulbs thrust their little\r\npointed noses through the cold earth and the development of the buds\r\nuntil they burst open into a blaze of color, flaunting their gorgeous\r\nheads in a farewell to old winter and giving a cheery welcome to the\r\ncoming summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-KEEPER'S COLUMN.\r\n\r\nConducted by FRANCIS JAGER, Professor of Apiculture, University\r\nFarm, St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf not already done the beekeeper should at once make his final\r\npreparations towards a successful wintering of bees. There are several\r\nconditions under which the bees winter well, all of which are more or\r\nless understood. The chief of these are a strong colony of young bees,\r\nsufficient amount of good stores, and the proper place to keep the bees.\r\n\r\nBees that were queenless late in the fall or bees that had an old queen\r\nwho stopped laying very early in the season, will have only few and old\r\nbees for wintering and will not have vitality enough to survive. Such\r\ncolonies should be united with some other good colony or if too far gone\r\nthey should be destroyed. Weak colonies should be united until they are\r\nstrong enough to occupy and fill when clustered at least six frames.\r\n\r\nThe best stores to winter bees on is pure honey capped over. Honey dew\r\nwill kill the bees in winter. If you have any black honey in your hives\r\nyou had better remove it and replace with white honey. A ten frame hive\r\nready for winter ought to contain from 35 to 40 pounds of honey. A\r\ncomplete hive if put on a scale should weigh not less than from 50 to 60\r\npounds. The best way to supply food to the bees is to remove the dry\r\ncombs and insert next to the cluster full combs of honey. Feeding sugar\r\nis a dangerous undertaking, and it should not be resorted to unless\r\nnecessity compels one to do it, and then feeding should be done early in\r\nthe season to allow the bees to invert the sugar, cap it over and\r\nconsume such stores which are not capped over before winter. The hives\r\nthat winter best are those which contain no uncapped honey in the\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nFor the bulk of beekeepers cellar wintering in Minnesota is to be\r\nrecommended. The things to be looked after in cellar wintering are:\r\nfirst, that the temperature of the cellar does not go much below 45\r\ndegrees, at least not for any length of time. Second, that the entrances\r\nare kept open and clear of dead bees and are guarded with four to the\r\ninch wire screen against mice. Third, that the moisture generated by the\r\nbees does not accumulate on the walls and covers of the hives. This is\r\nmost essential. Moisture absorbing material should be used in place of a\r\nwooden cover, for instance flax board or gunnysacks, or a super filled\r\nwith shavings over a queen excluder. The bees must have free passage\r\nover the top of the frames. We wintered the bees at University Farm\r\nwithout loss by using nothing else but the one inch flax board on top of\r\nthe hive, which kept the hive positively dry all winter.\r\n\r\nYour cellar should be dark, should have some ventilation, and the bees\r\nshould never be disturbed during their winter sleep. By following these\r\nrecommendations, you will be delighted to find your bees in the spring\r\nin a most flourishing condition for next summer's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HELPS\r\n\r\nConducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society\r\n\r\nEdited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the frosts have killed the _dahlia_ foliage the tubers should be\r\ndug and stored before the cold becomes so great. They may be injured by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe stems should be cut to about three or four inches of the roots,\r\nusing a sharp knife, so as to make a clean cut. To the stems attach the\r\nlabel firmly. Loosen the earth about each clump before attempting to\r\nlift it, then run the spade or fork as far under it as possible and pry\r\nit gently out. In this way the tubes will not be broken or injured where\r\nthey join the stem, which is the only place where they can make the next\r\nseason's growth. Most of the soil will drop off as they dry. Lay the\r\nroots so that water will not have a chance to collect in the soft hollow\r\nstems, or crown rot may trouble you.\r\n\r\nA cool, dry shed is a good place in which to cure the roots. Lay them on\r\nboards and turn them occasionally so they will dry evenly.\r\n\r\nIn a week's time they should be ready to store for winter, the best\r\nplace being a frost-proof cellar. Unless this is very dry, it is best to\r\nhave boards raised a few inches above the floor on which to lay them.\r\nThis will allow a current of air to pass under them. If a damp cellar\r\nmust be used, air slaked lime sprinkled under the boards will help to\r\nkeep them dry. Cover them a little with dry sand. The best temperature\r\nis 40 degrees.\r\n\r\n_Cannas_ can be lifted and stored at once. Cut the stems off short,\r\nleaving enough to attach the labels to. They keep best if lifted with as\r\nmuch soil about them as possible. The clumps can be set close together,\r\non boards arranged in the same way as for dahlias. They will stand a\r\nslightly warmer temperature than dahlias.\r\n\r\n_Tuberous begonias_, unlike dahlias and cannas, should be lifted without\r\ncutting the stems. They should be cured in the sun for at least two\r\nweeks and during that time turned to dry evenly and kept perfectly dry.\r\nA cold frame is a good place in which to do this. When the stems part\r\nreadily from the bulbs, the latter can be packed in boxes and stored in\r\nany dry place where the temperature will not fall below 40 degrees.\r\nThese are among the tenderest bulbs and should be the first to be\r\nlifted.\r\n\r\n_Gladioli_ should be lifted with their stems intact, tied in bundles and\r\nhung in a dry shed to dry. When thoroughly dry, the stems can be cut off\r\nand the bulbs packed in boxes and stored the same as the begonias. They\r\nare especially sensitive to heat, and if the air is too dry the bulbs\r\nwill shrivel and lose much of their vitality.\r\n\r\n_Montbretias_ should be lifted out and stored in the same way as the\r\ngladioli.\r\n\r\n_Tuberoses_ should be lifted with the stems intact and spread out to dry\r\nor hung in a dry place. When thoroughly cured, cut off the stems close\r\nto the bulb and store in the same way as gladioli.\r\n\r\n_Caladium, or Elephant's Ears_, should be lifted without disturbing the\r\nstem or leaves. As the leaves dry they can be removed, but the stem\r\nshould not be cut near the bulb, as this is the point of growth the\r\nfollowing year. They can be stored with the dahlias and cannas and are\r\nnot apt to shrivel, as the bulb is so large and fleshy.\r\n\r\n_Zephyrunthes, summer blooming hyacinths, tritomas, and tigridias_\r\nshould be lifted, cured, and stored in the same manner as gladioli.\r\n\r\nAll of these are subject to rot, so it is well to examine them\r\noccasionally. If any rot is found, remove the affected bulbs, and if\r\nthose remaining appear damp, dust lightly with air-slaked lime. Flowers\r\nof sulphur can also be used to dust them with to prevent this trouble.\r\nShould the bulbs be getting too dry, cover with sand. In our climate of\r\nextremes, it is necessary to examine them at intervals, and be prompt in\r\nthe use of a remedy if any of these adverse conditions are discovered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe November meeting of the Garden Flower Society will be held in the\r\nMinneapolis Park Board greenhouses, thirty-eighth street and Bryant\r\navenue, November 16, 2:30 p.m. Take Monroe and Bryant car. St. Paul\r\nmembers will transfer from the Selby-Lake at Bryant avenue. This will be\r\na chrysanthemum show, and a talk on hardy chrysanthemums will be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY'S CORNER\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA CROP IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION.--Will hold its annual\r\nmeeting this year at Fairmont on Feb. 21-22-23. The seed growers of\r\nMinnesota would be especially interested in this meeting, at which there\r\nare to be a number of seed contests, particulars in regard to which are\r\nnot at hand. They may be secured by addressing the secretary, Prof. C. P.\r\nBull, University Farm, St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETABLE GROWERS CONVENTION.--This convention, which is I\r\nunderstand an annual gathering of the vegetable growers of America, was\r\nlargely attended in Chicago the last week in September. A report\r\nreceived of the meeting indicates an attendance of eight hundred\r\nvegetable growers, including two hundred fifty from the vicinity of\r\nChicago. The city entertained them with an inspection trip, throughout\r\nCook County and later a party of them went to Racine and visited the\r\nexperimental gardens operated by Prof. R. L. Jones, of the Wisconsin\r\nUniversity. Perhaps we may have a fuller report of this meeting from\r\nsome of our Minnesota growers who were in attendance.\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL ELEMENT AT OUR ANNUAL MEETING.--Making the West\r\nHotel the headquarters of the society at the same time that the meeting\r\nis held in the building gives an especially good opportunity for\r\nrenewing and cultivating acquaintance amongst the members in attendance.\r\nThis was particularly noticeable last year, and without doubt one of the\r\nmost enjoyable features of the gathering. Placing emphasis upon this, an\r\nadditional room has been engaged for the coming meeting on the same\r\nfloor and adjoining the rooms occupied last year, which will be fitted\r\nup especially for a reception room where members and their friends may\r\ngather and rest as they visit and talk of the many things of interest\r\nconnected with our society and its work. A suitable sign will direct\r\nmembers to this reception room, and we anticipate that it will be made\r\nuse of largely.\r\n\r\nTHE PRIZE WINNER IN THE GARDEN AND CANNING CONTEST.--The\r\nHorticultural Society is offering $10.00 to pay railroad fare and\r\ntraveling expenses to attend the annual meeting of our society by the\r\nboy or girl making the best record in the state in the \"garden and\r\ncanning contest\" carried on by the Minnesota Extension Division. The\r\nsuccessful contestant will tell in his or her way how it was that\r\nsuccess was secured in the contest. Besides this prize of $10.00 each of\r\nthe ten boys or girls scoring next highest in this contest will receive\r\nan annual membership for 1917 in the State Horticultural Society. The\r\nname of the successful contestant is not yet announced.\r\n\r\nDELEGATES FROM SISTER SOCIETIES.--Several delegates have been\r\nappointed from horticultural societies in adjoining states, notices of\r\nwhich have reached this office.\r\n\r\nMr. D. E. Bingham, of Sturgeon Bay, Wis., is to represent the Wisconsin\r\nState Horticultural Society. Mr. Bingham has made fruit growing his life\r\nwork, a man of large experience, whose services are in demand in that\r\nstate also as an institute lecturer. We shall have an opportunity to\r\nprofit by his experience at our meeting, as you will note by consulting\r\nthe program.\r\n\r\nMr. G. D. Black, of Independence, Ia., is to represent the Northeast Iowa\r\nSociety. Mr. Black has been with us before and he will find many who\r\nrecall his presence here in previous years. He is to give us on the\r\nprogram his later experience in connection with the growing of the\r\ngladioli, a work to which he has given large attention for many years.\r\n\r\nFrom South Dakota is coming the president of that society, Rev. S. A.\r\nHassold, from Kimball, S.D.\r\n\r\nOther visitors from Iowa not officially sent to us who have signified an\r\nintention to be present are: Chas. F. Gardner, Osage, Ia.; E. M. Reeves,\r\nWaverly. Prof. S. A. Beach is also to spend the last two days of the\r\nannual meeting with us and his name will be found upon our program on\r\nseveral topics. No professional horticulturist in America is better or\r\nmore favorably known than Prof. Beach, and our membership who are\r\ninterested in orcharding should not fail to hear what he has to say on\r\nthe subjects he presents.\r\n\r\nMr. N. A. Rasmussen, of Oshkosh, Wis., is also to be with us and will be\r\nfound several times on the program. Being an expert in market gardening\r\nwe are going to work him to the limit while he is with us. We anticipate\r\nthat Secretary Cranefield of the Wisconsin Society, will also spend the\r\nweek with us. Prof. C.B. Waldron will be here as representative of the\r\nNorth Dakota Society, and also Prof. F.W. Broderick of Winnipeg as\r\nrepresenting the Winnipeg Horticultural Society--and of course our Prof.\r\nN.E. Hansen, of South Dakota. All of these friends will be found on the\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThere may be others, but this will do for a start.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OVER VEGETABLE TABLE AND ACROSS FRUIT EXHIBIT AT\r\n1916 MINNESOTA STATE FAIR.

W. TAYLOR, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had so many inquiries about our garden as to how we make things\r\ngrow, and as to the best plants to use, that we take pleasure in\r\nanswering through the Horticulturist and giving the result of our\r\nexperience in making an attractive perennial garden. Our soil is sandy\r\nloam, very quick and warm, except in one place where it is low and there\r\nis a heavy black soil over clay. It has been well enriched with well\r\nrotted manure and cultivated as much as possible every spring, where it\r\ncould be done without disturbing plants and bulbs. The arrangement of\r\nflowers as regards the blending and careful selection so that one bloom\r\ndoes not kill another is the secret of a beautiful garden. Acres of\r\nflowers placed without any regard to color, no matter how expensive\r\nindividual plants may be, is not pleasing to the eye. It is like a crowd\r\nof mixed people, and we know crowds are never beautiful. There is\r\nincompatibility among flowers as there is among people, and the\r\ncompatible must be associated or there is no harmony.\r\n\r\nWhat do we raise and how do we do it? We will, in the space allowed,\r\nanswer this as best we can. It is not necessary to spend a great lot of\r\nmoney if one uses good judgment and knows where to buy. Take that grand\r\nflower, the peony. One can spend as much money as one pleases on these.\r\nThere is just now a fad regarding these flowers, and some rich people\r\nare paying as high as $30.00 a root for certain kinds, but it is not\r\nnecessary. The most really lovely gardens I have seen in the East and\r\nWest have not been filled with plants bought at fancy prices. We have\r\nsome that originally cost us a good deal of money and which are now\r\ncheap, as for instance, the Henryii lily. We bought the first we heard\r\nof at one dollar and one-half each. Now they can be bought for thirty\r\ncents. In peonies, Baroness Schroeder, an ivory white, is selling for\r\nthree dollars a root, while the most beautiful of all the whites\r\naccording to my taste, Festiva Maxima, can be bought for fifty cents.\r\nThe Kelways are all fine. The best cost about one dollar each. In our\r\ngarden, among others, the Pallas, Edulis Superba, Golden Harvest, Madame\r\nCrousse and Queen Victoria, all fine, cost us fifty cents each. We have\r\na row all around our garden of these splendid flowers, many varieties,\r\nsome very rare, and nothing could be more gorgeous in color or more\r\neffective than this border. Hundreds of people came to see this peony\r\nshow this year and were extravagant in their praise. The perfect harmony\r\nof arrangement was what pleased. We made many friends happy with armfuls\r\nof them to take home. That is the pleasure of your garden, the enjoyment\r\none gets from making others happy. We especially notice how pleased the\r\nchildren were, the girls more so than the boys, perhaps, as they\r\nwandered along the paths fondling this or that bloom with loving\r\nfingers. With such an amount of bloom it is easy to send bouquets to the\r\nchildrens' hospitals and to sick friends. We plant the peonies with the\r\ncrown just under the earth, two feet apart. In the fall we cut off the\r\nold stalks and replace them over the plants after putting a good\r\ndressing of rotted manure on the beds.\r\n\r\nAnother flower, which is very attractive, is the larkspur Belladonna,\r\nturquoise blue. It shows from a great distance as its heavenly blue\r\nmeets the eye. When arranged in a vase with white flowers it makes the\r\nmost beautiful, choice and refined bouquet we know of. The Formosum is a\r\nlovely dark blue and very striking. Give them plenty of water and some\r\nwood ashes to keep off the slugs. Cut off the stalks after blooming,\r\nabout August first, and they will bloom again in autumn. We had this\r\nyear a large clump of Madonna lilies and next to them a large bunch of\r\nlarkspur. The effect was stunning. Just before the larkspur came the\r\nwhole north end of the garden was aflame with Oriental poppies, hundreds\r\nof them. No other flower produces the effect upon one that this great\r\nproud, wonderful flower does. It is the queen of the show. We transplant\r\nthis in September in ordinary soil. Or we sow the seeds in August and\r\ntransplant the seedlings as soon as up. They need no protection, but we\r\nprotect everything with straw and branches. The branches to keep the\r\nstraw from packing too hard and keeping the air out. Protection of\r\nroses is necessary, of course. We had a great collection this season.\r\nOur plan is to cut them back to within a foot of the ground then fill a\r\nbox with leaves and turn over them. We never lose a rose thus protected.\r\nNeither sun nor mice injure them.\r\n\r\nAnother grand flower is Digitalis, or foxglove. These gladden your heart\r\nas the medicine made from them strengthens it. Get the mixed plants or\r\nseed, Gloxinia flora. When in bloom, look into their little gloves and\r\nnote the wonder of nature's coloring. With us they grow six feet tall in\r\nblack, heavy soil. They self-sow, and the plants of the present year\r\nbloom the next. A bed of these make a most gorgeous, dignified group in\r\nyour garden. They are hardy with a very slight covering. Many with us\r\nself-sow and live through the winter without any protection. We made up\r\na bed of these self-sowed in fall of 1915. They were a glory this\r\nsummer. A few years ago every one said, don't waste your time on\r\nJapanese Iris. They thrive with us and bear blooms fully as large as a\r\ntea plate and of most exquisite beauty. We divide them every third year\r\nand in the spring cover them with old fertilizer and water them well.\r\nThey grow in a heavy soil with some sand worked in. Our best varieties\r\nare Oriole, Distinction, Alice Kiernga, Beauty of Japan and Blue Flag.\r\n\r\nThe Gladiolus is another bright and interesting addition to our floral\r\nfamily. The best we have are Marie de Ruyter, a pretty blue; Badenia,\r\nlavender; Golden King, a magnificent yellow; Florence, lilac blotched;\r\nMazie, corn color; and Dawn, shell pink. Plant these bulbs in\r\nsuccession, three weeks apart, from April first, six inches deep, so\r\nthey will stand up, and eighteen inches between rows. In this way you\r\nwill have them until frost. For the house cut them when first bud comes\r\nout, and they will all blossom in water.\r\n\r\nA flower which attracts much attention with us is the Canterbury Bell,\r\ncup and saucer variety, in different colors. Very showy. This is not a\r\nperennial but a biennial. We plant our seeds in July and transplant in\r\nSeptember or October. The Persicifolia in white and blue is a hardy\r\nperennial and grows on stalks two to three feet high, a great favorite\r\namong white flowers. In some soils they do not do well, but with us grow\r\nrampant. We prefer the white. We cut over two thousand stalks this\r\nsummer from one hundred fifty plants.\r\n\r\nOf Tulips, which are so welcome in early spring, the Darwin leads all.\r\nWe love them as we do the Stars of Bethlehem, the Hyacinths, Narcissi\r\nand the darling little blue flowers, Scilla Siberica, that come with the\r\nSnowdrops and Crocuses before the snow is gone. We thus have bloom from\r\nsnow to snow. Always something bright, and that is another strong reason\r\nfor a perennial garden.\r\n\r\nWe have many calls from persons wishing to buy plants or seeds. We do\r\nnot sell either, but gladly give away our surplus. We have furnished\r\nmany gardens in this way all about us and thus added to the beauty of\r\nthe surrounding country and made ourselves and others happy. Our\r\ncollection of Lilies, Auratums, Speciosums, Tigers, Madonnas, are all\r\nplanted six to eight inches deep and, after spreading manure are covered\r\nwith straw, after frost. We cover all bulb beds with manure in the fall.\r\nAmong lilies all but the Auratums last years, but these lose their\r\nvitality in two or three seasons. Plant all lilies in fall except\r\nMadonnas, which should be put in in August. Two fine flowers we would\r\nrecommend to flower lovers: the Amaryllis Hallii, or, as we call it, the\r\nwonder flower, which grows a large bunch of leaves in spring and in June\r\nthey all die down. In August there springs up a single stalk from the\r\napparently dead plant, bearing a lily-like bunch of flowers of charming\r\ncolors. It is as hardy as an oak. The other is the Dictamnus, or gas\r\nplant. Most beautiful and very hardy. Get one white and one pink and\r\nplant near each other. They are fine. Of course we have named but a\r\nsmall part of our collection, but will be glad to give any further\r\ninformation to our Horticulturist readers and will be glad to welcome\r\nthem at our grounds any time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCANNING FRUITS WITHOUT SIRUP.--Can the product the same day it\r\nis picked. Cull, stem, or seed, and clean the fruit by placing it in a\r\nstrainer and pouring water over it until it is clean. Pack the product\r\nthoroughly in glass jars or tin cans until they are full; use the handle\r\nof a tablespoon, wooden ladle, or table knife for packing purposes. Pour\r\nover the fruit boiling water from a kettle, place rubbers and caps in\r\nposition, partially seal if using glass jars, seal completely if using\r\ntin cans. Place the containers in a sterilizing vat, such as a wash\r\nboiler with false bottom, or other receptacle improvised for the\r\npurpose. If using a hot-water bath outfit, process for 30 minutes; count\r\ntime after the water has reached the boiling point; the water must cover\r\nthe highest jar in container. After sterilizing seal glass jars, wrap in\r\npaper to prevent bleaching, and store in a dry, cool place.\r\n\r\nIf you are canning in tin cans it will improve the product to plunge the\r\ncans quickly into cold water immediately after sterilization. When using\r\na steam pressure canner instead of the hot-water bath, sterilize for 10\r\nminutes with 5 pounds of steam pressure. Never allow the pressure to go\r\nover 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding Farm.\r\n\r\nCHAS. HARALSON, SUPT., EXCELSIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding Farm was established eight years ago,\r\nprincipally for breeding new varieties of fruit adapted to our climate\r\nand conditions. The aim of this work is to assist the people in getting\r\nbetter commercial varieties of the various fruits grown in the state, so\r\nthat better returns could be secured for the people engaged in the\r\nvarious lines of fruit growing. Some of the plant-breeding work is\r\nbeginning to show results, a few varieties of fruit are being\r\ndistributed in a small way for trial in different localities.\r\n\r\nA great deal of work has been done with apples. Seedlings have been\r\ngrown by the thousands every year with the idea of selecting some\r\ndesirable varieties when the trees come into fruiting. Hardiness of\r\ntree, long keeping and good quality of fruit are the most desirable\r\npoints we are looking for in our selections. A great deal of crossing\r\nunder glass is being done with apples; a number of seedlings, the\r\nresults of this crossing work, are planted every spring.\r\n\r\nSome of the six thousand Malinda apple seedlings planted seven years ago\r\nhave fruited to some extent for the last three years. These show a great\r\nvariation in fruit, both in color, quality and long keeping. Some of the\r\nfruit ripens with the Duchess, while others will keep until spring in\r\ngood condition. There is a chance for some desirable varieties out of\r\nthis lot, but it will take several years to determine whether we have\r\nanything better than the Wealthy. The Wealthy is by far our best\r\ncommercial variety, but we are looking for something that will keep\r\nuntil spring.\r\n\r\nGooseberries and currants are easily raised and are perfectly hardy with\r\nus, but we are working to get some improvement on these varieties. Many\r\nthousand seedlings are being grown for this purpose. Our native\r\ngooseberries are used in breeding work with the cultivated varieties to\r\na great extent, as they are hardy, strong growers and resistant to\r\nmildew.\r\n\r\nAs to cherries, we have none that are satisfactory. Some work has been\r\ncarried on for several years, but we have not obtained anything of\r\nspecial value so far. The most promising combinations are Compass cherry\r\ncrossed with the cultivated varieties. None of these have fruited, but\r\nwe have some hope for a hardy cherry from these seedlings.\r\n\r\nPeaches and apricots are not hardy in Minnesota, and consequently nobody\r\nthinks of planting them. Some years ago we started crossing the sand\r\ncherry with peaches and apricots. The results were a number of\r\nseedlings, but all turned out to be worthless; the trees after several\r\nyears growth were small, or grew mostly in bush form. They blossomed\r\nevery spring but never set any fruit on account of some imperfection in\r\nthe flowers. Four years ago we started to use the Compass cherry as the\r\nmale parent, and this combination is more promising. The seedlings make\r\na good growth and a fairly good sized tree, practically as hardy as the\r\nCompass cherry. The seedlings resemble the apricots and peaches in\r\nblossom, tree and foliage. This fruit will not be exactly an apricot or\r\na peach, but may take the place of these fruits in a small way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 7 Hybrid Seedling Plum--from Minnesota State\r\nFruit-Breeding Farm, at Zumbra Heights.]\r\n\r\nThe Compass cherry crossed with Prunus Pissardi, or purple leaf plum, is\r\na very interesting combination. We have about fifty seedlings growing.\r\nMost of them have the purple foliage and bark, are very ornamental and\r\ncan be used with effect for lawns and landscape planting where large\r\nshrubs are wanted.\r\n\r\nThe grapes. The Vitis Labrusca, such as Concord, Worden, Moore's Early\r\nand many other varieties, are not hardy unless protected during winter.\r\nThere is a demand for hardy grapes that do not need any winter\r\nprotection. At the Fruit-Breeding Farm this problem has been taken up on\r\na large scale. The Beta grape is hardy but lacks in size and quality.\r\nThis variety has been used to grow many thousands of seedlings from, and\r\nalso used in cross-breeding with the better varieties. A large percent\r\nof Beta seedlings come true to seed or nearly so. This gives us several\r\nhundred varieties equal to Beta, and some of them are quite an\r\nimprovement in size and quality over the parent and practically as hardy\r\nas the wild grape. Many of these are worthy of propagation where\r\nhardiness is the main object. Very few of the hybrid grape seedlings\r\nhave fruited, but indications are that in a few years we will have\r\ngrapes equal in size and quality to any of our commercial varieties.\r\n\r\nExperiments are being carried on in a small way with pears, roses and\r\nnuts. Our native hazelnuts can be improved by selection and crossing\r\nwith the filberts. The same is true with the Rosa Rugosa and our native\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nIn breeding strawberries we probably have had better success than with\r\nany other fruit we have attempted to improve. The breeding work was done\r\nin the greenhouse during winter and early spring and seed planted as\r\nsoon as berries were ripe. The plants were transplanted to flats and\r\nlater planted out in the field, where they remained until fruiting, when\r\nthe selections were made. We have fruited approximately 60,000\r\nseedlings. These have been weeded out so there are about 400 left, and\r\nthese will be cut down to a few of the best varieties. At present we\r\nhave one everbearing and one June-bearing variety which have proven to\r\nbe very productive, of good size, good quality and good plantmakers.\r\nThese plants have been sent out as premiums to members of the State\r\nHorticultural Society for the last two years and will be distributed the\r\nsame way next spring.\r\n\r\nIn raspberries we have several varieties which are promising. King x\r\nLoudan, No. 4, is a variety that has been sent out as premium the last\r\nthree years. This variety is amongst the hardiest, the berries are dark\r\nred, very large and the most productive of all the varieties growing on\r\nthe place. This has also been sent out as premium through the\r\nHorticultural Society.\r\n\r\nIn plums we probably have had the best success. Some of the first\r\nbreeding work was with Burbank x (crossed with) Wolf and Abundance x\r\nWolf. We have twenty-eight seedlings of Burbank x Wolf and forty-five\r\nAbundance x Wolf which have fruited several years. We have varying\r\ndegrees of hardiness in these seedlings. Most of them have withstood our\r\nwinters at the fruit farm without injury, as well as in most of the\r\nsouthern half of the state.\r\n\r\nAmong the Abundance x Wolf hybrids eight of the seedlings are only\r\npartly hardy, while of the Burbank x Wolf only one or two have shown\r\nthemselves to be particularly weak in this respect.\r\n\r\nType of fruit. In general the Burbank type of fruit is dominant. The\r\nflesh of these hybrids runs quite uniformly yellow, varying in degrees,\r\nhowever, from a deep yellow to a yellowish green. Some of them have a\r\nyellow skin with a blush or a streak of red, while others are a deep red\r\neven before ripe. The fruit in size varies from both smaller and larger\r\nthan the parents. Firmness characterises most of the hybrids. We are\r\nalso getting good shipping quality, and in Burbank x Wolf No. 12 we have\r\na plum measuring one and three-quarters inches and more in diameter and\r\na perfect freestone. This plum will be used extensively in further\r\nplant-breeding.\r\n\r\nIn shape of tree the two hybrids differ materially. The Burbank x Wolf\r\nhybrids make spreading trees more or less, while the Abundance x Wolf\r\ngrows more upright and does not need quite as much room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTENT CATERPILLAR.--As soon as small nests are detected, they\r\nshould be destroyed. When in convenient reach, the nests may be torn out\r\nwith a brush, with gloved hand, or otherwise, and the larvae crushed on\r\nthe ground, care being taken to destroy any caterpillars which have\r\nremained on the tree.\r\n\r\nThe use of a torch to burn out the nests will be found convenient when\r\nthey occur in the higher parts of the trees. In using the torch great\r\ncare is necessary that no important injury be done to the tree; it\r\nshould not be used in burning out nests except in the smaller branches\r\nand twigs, the killing of which would be of no special importance. Nests\r\nin the larger limbs should be destroyed by hand, as the use of the torch\r\nmay kill the bark, resulting in permanent injury.\r\n\r\nTent caterpillars are readily destroyed by arsenicals sprayed on the\r\nfoliage of trees infested by them. Any of the arsenical insecticides may\r\nbe used, as Paris green, Scheele's green, arsenate of lead, etc. The\r\nfirst two are used at the rate of one-half pound to 50 gallons of water.\r\nThe milk of lime made from 2 to 3 pounds of stone lime should be added\r\nto neutralize any caustic effect of the arsenical on the foliage.\r\nArsenate of lead is used at the rate of 2 pounds to each 50 gallons of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOn stone fruits, such as cherry, peach, and plum, arsenicals are likely\r\nto cause injury to foliage and must be used with caution if at all. On\r\nsuch trees the arsenate of lead is preferable, as it is less injurious\r\nto foliage, and on all trees sticks much better. In spraying for the\r\ntent caterpillar only, applications should be made while the\r\ncaterpillars are yet small, as they then succumb more quickly to poisons\r\nthan when more nearly full grown, and prompt treatment stops further\r\ndefoliation of the trees.--U. S. Dept. Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColor Combinations in the Garden.\r\n\r\nMISS ELIZABETH STARR, 2224 FREMONT SO., MINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish books on gardening set forth two principal methods of making a\r\ngarden: first, to have each part perfect for a short time each year and\r\nthen let it melt into the background for the rest of the season; second,\r\nto have every part of the garden showing some flowers all through the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThese two methods suggest the impressionistic and miniature schools of\r\npainting. With the first method it is possible to get great masses of\r\ncolor and brilliant effects to be viewed at a distance, but it requires\r\na great deal of space, with a perennial garden at least, for\r\nunfortunately most of our perennials are in their greatest glory for\r\nonly a few weeks at a time. The second method fills more nearly the\r\nneeds of the small garden, where the vistas are short and the individual\r\nplant is under close inspection. The greatest difficulty is this, that\r\nthe amateur cannot resist the lure of a great variety of plants, and\r\nunless a vigorous thinning out is faithfully practiced and the habit of\r\ngrowth, the period of blooming, the height and color of each individual\r\nis carefully studied, the effect of the whole is very apt to be mussy\r\nand distracting to the eye, whereas the ideal garden is soothing in\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nI have only been studying the problem for the last five or six years, so\r\nthat I am still decidedly an amateur, but I have kept a faithful record\r\nof the time of flowering of each variety I have grown in my garden and\r\nhave discovered that the time of blooming does not vary more than five\r\ndays for each plant no matter whether the season be wet or dry. With\r\nthis record at hand I can arrange each part of my garden with a view to\r\nthe succession of bloom throughout the summer. I can place plants with\r\nclashing colors side by side with the calm assurance that they will not\r\nclash because their periods of blooming do not overlap. In this way I\r\ncan completely change the color of certain parts of my garden during the\r\nsummer if I so desire.\r\n\r\nIn studying combinations for the garden we must take into consideration\r\nthe harmony and contrast of color, texture, form, height and the\r\nsuccession of bloom. We must also see that plants requiring the same\r\nsoil and the same care are put together. In my garden I use both annuals\r\nand perennials but am limited in choice to those plants that are\r\nperfectly hardy, that will stand infinite neglect, drought, much wind, a\r\nstiff soil, that do not require especial protection in the winter, that\r\nwill be in bloom all summer long and be beautiful. This, as I have\r\nfound, is a rather difficult task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perennial border. Edging of pinks and Shasta daisies,\r\npink canterbury bells and Festiva Maxima peony. Behind, pyrethrum,\r\nuliginosum and hollyhocks. Blue flowering flax adds depth to the pink\r\nand white.]\r\n\r\nThere is a great diversity of opinion as to how to set out plants. Some\r\nsay, \"Give each plant plenty of room; let it expand as much as it will.\"\r\nOthers say, \"Each six inches of ground should have its plant; set them\r\nso closely that no dirt will show between; in this way each individual\r\nplant will be finer than when set out singly and the leaves will form a\r\nshade for the ground.\" I have used the latter method, for, since we have\r\nno means of watering, the conservation of moisture is an important item.\r\nThe chief objection is that there is a constant danger of overcrowding,\r\nand it requires a frequent resetting of plants as they increase in size\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellow iris against the blue of distant hills.]\r\n\r\nI have a border on the north side of my garden that is six feet wide and\r\nabout seventy feet long. It is my aim to keep this in bloom all through\r\nthe summer long. There is a background of purple and white lilacs and\r\ncut-leaf spirea. The first thing that comes in the spring is poet's\r\nnarcissus, then groups of Darwin tulips; both of these are naturalized\r\nand remain in the ground from year to year. Next comes the perennial\r\nblue flax, a half dozen plants set at intervals down the border, that\r\nevery morning from mid-April until August are a mass of blue. Clumps of\r\nMay-flowering iris and then June-flowering iris and four large peony\r\nplants make the border bright until the latter part of June, when\r\nalternating groups of field daisies and pink and red sweet williams are\r\nin full bloom at one end of the border, and summer-flowering cosmos\r\nholds sway at the other end, while the flax, bachelor's buttons and\r\ndaisies fill the center with blue and white. By the middle of July the\r\ncalendulas, coreopsis and annual larkspur make a vivid display where the\r\nnarcissus was before. These four make a very good combination, for if\r\nthe bed is well made and the narcissus planted deep, the coreopsis and\r\nlarkspur seed themselves, and with the exception of a deep raking in the\r\nlate fall the bed needs no attention except thinning out for three\r\nyears, and it is in bloom for at least four months of the season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pink and white pinks, field and Shasta daisies,\r\ncanterbury bells and hollyhocks.]\r\n\r\nIn this border I have at last found a place for the magenta phlox that\r\nusually fights with the whole garden. I put it in front of a single row\r\nof pink and white cosmos, flank it on one side with pink and white\r\nverbenas, on the other with mixed scabiosas and in front of all a single\r\nrow of Shasta daisies. This combination pleases the family as well as\r\nthe phlox.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the garden, against a low buckthorn hedge is a\r\nnarrower border of sky-blue belladonna, delphinium, buttercups and\r\nachillea, with an edging of Chinese pinks. I had thought the\r\ncomplementary colors of the delphinium and buttercups would set each\r\nother off, but it is a very poor combination, for the foliage is so much\r\nalike that there is no contrast there, and when the plants are not in\r\nbloom it is almost impossible to tell which is which so as to take out\r\nthe buttercups, whose yellow is too bright. Shasta daisies set off the\r\ndelphiniums to perfection with the wonderful purity of their white and\r\nyellow and pleasing contrast of form, foliage and height. With Emperor\r\nnarcissus bulbs set between the plants, there are flowers in the border\r\nthe whole season.\r\n\r\nAnother very poor combination that is in my garden, much to my sorrow,\r\nis hemerocallis and siberica iris. They started out about three feet\r\nfrom each other, but the hemerocallis spreads so quickly that now they\r\nform a mass that is almost impossible to break apart. Another mistake I\r\nmade was to put Shasta daisies and field daisies near together. It is\r\nunfair to the smaller daisies, for although they are fully two inches in\r\ndiameter, yet they appear dwarfed beside the giants.\r\n\r\nThere is one point in my garden that is vivid throughout the summer.\r\nFirst comes the orange lilium elegans, then scarlet lychnis and later,\r\ntiger lilies. Another bit is gorgeous from the first of August until\r\nfrost; it is made up of blue and white campanula pyramidalis, that grow\r\nquite five feet high, and Mrs. Francis King gladioli.\r\n\r\nAn important thing to think of is the line of vision from each point of\r\nvantage of the house--the endwise view of a multicolored bed of fairy\r\ncolumbines against a light green willow from the sewing room window,\r\nfrom the library the blue of a Juniata iris swaying four feet up in the\r\nair in front of a sweet briar, from the front porch pale yellow\r\nFlavescens iris through a mist of purple sweet rockets.\r\n\r\nThe garden is in its glory during the iris season. At a conservative\r\nestimate we have about twenty-five hundred of them in our little garden,\r\nranging through all the colors of the rainbow and blooming from April\r\nuntil late June. They may easily make such an increase that it is\r\nbaffling to cope with, but they are so beautiful and so amenable to the\r\nexperimenting of an amateur that we feel as though we couldn't get\r\nenough of them. Last summer a wonderful effect was achieved by putting\r\ndark blue and mahogany-colored pansies beside Jacquesiana and Othello\r\niris, this repeating the color and texture in different plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rocky Mountain columbine against the willow hedge, with\r\nperennial candytuft as edging.]\r\n\r\nWe leave the garden through a wooden arch. Climbing over one side of\r\nthis is a Thousandschon rose, and on the other side a Dr. Van Fleet\r\ngrows rank. A wild clematis is planted beside each rose and fills the\r\ntop of the arch. I am rather dubious about the combination, for I fear\r\nthe clematis may grow so heavy that it will choke out the roses, but\r\nthis summer at least it was beautiful, and another summer will come to\r\ntry other combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruck Crop and Garden Insects.\r\n\r\nAN EXERCISE LED BY PROF. WM. MOORE, ENTOMOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY\r\nFARM, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one insect that probably all those who are in the market garden\r\nbusiness are very much interested in, and that is the cabbage maggot. As\r\nyou all know, in the spring of the year, after cabbages are put out,\r\nfrequently you will find the cabbages slowly dying, one dying one day\r\nand two or three the next day, and so on until sometimes fifty per cent\r\nor more of the cabbages die. At first it is not exactly apparent what is\r\nkilling the cabbages, but when one is pulled up it will be noticed that\r\na little maggot is working in the root of the cabbage. This insect is\r\ncommonly known as the cabbage maggot.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years work has been carried on with the cabbage maggot,\r\nand all sorts of treatments have been tried, many without any great\r\nsuccess. The unfortunate part is that usually the market gardener don't\r\ntake much thought of this maggot until it is actually doing the injury,\r\nand at that time they are mighty difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nThere have been several different treatments advised, one of which is\r\nfresh hellebore, about two ounces steeped in a quart of boiling water\r\nand then diluted to a gallon and poured upon the base of the plant. It\r\nwill destroy the maggots, but hellebore is very expensive and, as\r\nprobably most of you know, there isn't a great amount of profit in\r\ncabbage; so any treatment will have to be a cheap treatment, or you will\r\nuse up your profit.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years I have been working along a line which is\r\nentirely different from the treatment of the maggot, and that is based\r\nupon the fact that the fly which lays the egg which produces the maggot\r\nin the cabbage comes out early in the spring and flies about the field\r\nfor probably a week or ten days or two weeks before it lays its eggs,\r\nand during that period it eats any sweet material which happens to be on\r\nhand. With this as a basis we thought we might be able to poison the\r\nflies and thus prevent injury from the maggots, and we have tried\r\nseveral different spray mixtures along that line. One mixture which we\r\nuse is a mixture which is normally used against the fruit flies which\r\nare oftentimes injurious to fruit, particularly in the east and in\r\ntropical countries. This contains three ounces of arsenate of lead, two\r\nand half pounds of brown sugar and four gallons of water. The idea is to\r\nspray this in the field, spraying it on the plants as soon as the\r\nplants are put out in the field. We have more or less definite dates for\r\nthe appearance of the flies in the field and for their disappearance\r\nagain. But, as you know, the season varies, and the result is somewhat\r\nuncertain. So probably the best method is to base it upon the time you\r\nplant out your cabbage. In the early seasons you will plant your\r\ncabbages early, and in the late seasons later. So plant out your cabbage\r\nand then spray them every week until the 10th of May.\r\n\r\nYou should spray them, not to cover the leaves with the poison, but\r\nmerely sufficient so that there are a few drops of this poisoned\r\nmaterial on the leaves so that the flies can eat it. Flies will come\r\nthere and feed upon this mixture and die.\r\n\r\nIt is rather peculiar that we started work here about the same time on\r\nthe cabbage maggot that they started work on the onion maggot along\r\nsimilar lines in Wisconsin. I don't think that either knew that the\r\nother was working towards that end. They used a different mixture,\r\none-fifth ounce of sodium arsenite, one-half pint of New Orleans\r\nmolasses and one gallon of water. This was sprayed over the onions and\r\nwas very successful in controlling the onion maggot.\r\n\r\nI tried their mixture this last year. They published some of their\r\nresults last year, so it gave me an opportunity to watch their mixture\r\nin comparison with the lead arsenate. They claimed the lead arsenate did\r\nnot act as quickly as the sodium arsenite. That is true, but when you\r\nhave a ten-day period to kill the fly it don't make much difference\r\nwhether it dies in ten hours or twenty-four. The flies are not doing any\r\ninjury. If you take the lead arsenate and sugar and water and put it in\r\na jar, the arsenate always sinks to the bottom, and if you were to test\r\nit that way, the fly would feed on the top and you might not get a quick\r\nresult. But if you spray it on, the lead arsenate will kill as quickly\r\nas the sodium arsenite.\r\n\r\nThere is an objection to the use of arsenite in that sodium arsenite is\r\na soluble poison and will burn the leaves of the cabbage. Of course,\r\nthat is not particularly serious as those are the first leaves the\r\ncabbages have and the cabbage soon gets over any slight injury, but many\r\ntruck gardeners probably would object to that. In the onion you have a\r\ndifferent shaped leaf, and the injury is not so apparent. Last summer I\r\nfound that New Orleans molasses would give you a little bit better\r\nresult than the sugar, and it is cheaper. The objection to the New\r\nOrleans molasses is the sticky nature of the material in handling.\r\n\r\nI might mention in regard to opening cans of New Orleans molasses. If\r\nyou never opened one and try this treatment, be careful about opening\r\nthe can. The lid is pushed down tight and under warm conditions, or if\r\nthe molasses has been in a warm room there is a certain amount of\r\nfermentation and gas under pressure, and if you pry it open quickly you\r\nfind the lid flies up in the air and you will probably be smeared over\r\nwith molasses.\r\n\r\nI employed my spray, that is, one ounce of lead arsenate, one-half pint\r\nof New Orleans molasses and one gallon of water last season. The check\r\nplots had cabbages attacked by the maggots, probably 10 or 15 per cent\r\nof the plants dying from the attack. Last year was a very good season,\r\nthat is, many of the plants seriously attacked put out roots again, and\r\nthose were able to grow again in the sprayed plots. The infestation of\r\nthe sprayed plots was probably about 30 to 40 per cent. of the plants,\r\nbut they only contained probably one maggot each, which is very slight\r\nand not sufficient to do any damage.\r\n\r\nThere is one market gardener whose cabbage patch we sprayed, I think,\r\nonly a part of two rows, and we thought we would leave the rest of his\r\npatch as a control. Apparently the amount of material we put on there\r\nwas sufficient to attract the flies from the whole field. Not a single\r\ncabbage died, and he was pleased with the result of the spray.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: What do you do for root aphis?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Root aphis can very easily be controlled with tobacco\r\nextract. It is put upon the root of any plant that is affected, a\r\ntablespoonful to a gallon of water. There are a number of different\r\ntobacco extracts on the market. Some of them contain 15 per cent. of\r\nnicotine, some contain 20, some 25 and some 40, and I think there is one\r\nbrand that contains 45 per cent. You will find that the brands that\r\ncontain the most nicotine are the most expensive, but in proportion you\r\nuse less material. Thus 20 per cent. tobacco extract would take two\r\ntablespoonfuls to the gallon, while 40 per cent. would take only one. It\r\nis the nicotine which is the working portion of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: Then you can use the black leaf forty?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: It is very good, it is 40 per cent. nicotine. There is\r\nanother product put out by the same company, a black leaf, only 15 or 20\r\nper cent. This is cheaper, but you have to use more of it. If anything\r\nprobably the more expensive would be the cheaper in the long run.\r\n\r\nMr. Wintersteen: The maggots that attack the radishes and turnips are\r\nthe same as the cabbage maggot?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Wintersteen: Why is it I have no trouble with the cabbages, and yet\r\nI can raise no radishes or turnips in the same ground?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: The radishes and turnips are attacked and the cabbages are\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. Wintersteen: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Which do you raise, early cabbages?\r\n\r\nMr. Wintersteen: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: What variety do you raise?\r\n\r\nMr. Wintersteen: The Wakefield, generally.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Some varieties of cabbages are not nearly so severely\r\nattacked as others. I think of the two that they would prefer radishes\r\nprobably. Growing them side by side you find they infest the radishes.\r\nThat was my experience last year. I grew the first generation of\r\ncabbages, and the second generation I took over into the radishes\r\nbecause I wanted to treat them there.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: Did you say the same fly attacks the onion and the\r\ncabbage?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: The onion has two different flies, one which is black in\r\ncolor, with light colored bands across the wings, and that one passes\r\nthe winter as a larva in the old onions left in the field. It is an\r\ninjurious practice to leave old onions there to breed these maggots. If\r\nthey were taken out and destroyed you could do away with that one. The\r\ncabbage fly is different. When you use the spray it would probably be\r\nall right to use the sodium arsenite for the onion and the lead arsenate\r\nfor the cabbage. The type of leaf is entirely different, and on the\r\ncabbage you are apt to burn them with the sodium arsenite while the lead\r\narsenate will give you practically the same result.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: The cabbage butterfly, does that come from the same maggot?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: No; this maggot is on the root, the cabbage butterfly lays\r\nits eggs on the leaf. You get the cabbage worm from the cabbage\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: What do you do for that?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Paris green is used to a great extent, but many people have a\r\nhorror of using Paris green. Last year, I think it was, I was called up\r\non the phone by some one and I advised him to use Paris green. He said\r\nthat he was afraid it might poison everybody. I explained to him there\r\nwas no danger from it, as you know the cabbage leaves grow from the\r\ninside, not from the outside, and the spray would be on the outside\r\nleaves. Besides that, we usually spray early for the cabbage worm while\r\nthe heads come on later.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: Did you ever try capsicum, sprinkling that on the heads?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy: I saved my cabbages one year by using that.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Some people claim salt is good. One of the students mentioned\r\nit to me. One applied it by putting a spoonful around over the head,\r\nanother dissolved a tablespoonful in about ten quarts of water and\r\nsprayed it on. Salt is rather injurious to vegetation as a rule. Of\r\ncourse, they only put it on the leaves, and the cabbage is a hardy\r\nplant. Air slaked lime is also good, but would have to be applied\r\nseveral times. With the arsenate you apply it once and kill all the\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nMr. Ludlow: We took them all off of mine one year by using boiling hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Yes, sir; water is very good. The objection is, on a large\r\nscale it is not feasible.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: Slug shot is very good.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Yes, sir; it doesn't contain very much poison, but it is\r\nsufficient to kill the cabbage worm.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadoo: I used just simply wood ashes.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: The cabbage worm is one that is very easy to handle.\r\n\r\nA Member: I have always used salt. I think it makes a more firm and\r\nsolid head, that is my theory, I don't know whether I am right or not. I\r\nhave been doing that for years.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: I don't know. I never heard of the treatment with salt until\r\ntwo or three days ago when several students mentioned that they used\r\nsalt. Some people won't use Paris green. There was one case a man said\r\nhis wife wouldn't let him do it even if she knew it wasn't poison; she\r\ndidn't like the idea of Paris green on cabbage.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingersoll: Is there anything you can suggest to control the yellows\r\nin asters?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: The yellows in asters has been a problem which has been very\r\namusing there at the farm. A man sends in an aster to the entomological\r\ndepartment, we examine it and can't find anything that belongs to our\r\ndepartment, and we send it to the plant pathological department, and\r\nthey send it back to us. Last year we made a point in every case of\r\nyellows in asters to send some one to investigate and find out what was\r\ngoing on to produce it. In some cases it seemed to be a fungous disease.\r\nOne case I know turned out to be a fungous disease, the very next one\r\nwas due to plant lice on the roots of the asters. In that case I don't\r\nthink you get quite the distinct yellows of the asters, but rather the\r\nplants wilt and become weak and finally die. That can very easily be\r\ncontrolled with tobacco extract, pouring it upon the buds of the plants.\r\nWe do not know definitely about the yellows. We think it is more or less\r\nof a physiological disease of the plant, not due to an insect. This last\r\nyear we have not found any what we would call the true yellows. There is\r\nan insect that produces similar trouble on other plants, a plant bug,\r\nwhich is hard to secure because it flies away. That is the reason we\r\nhave been sending out to see exactly what is going on in the field, and\r\nwe didn't see any evidence of their work this year. Another thing, it\r\nseems to be a year in which the asters did fairly well, and there was\r\nvery little yellows.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingersoll: You think that irregular watering might make any\r\ndifference or very solid rooting?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: It might do something of the sort. The most we heard of the\r\nyellows was the year before last, and we were held up at the time with\r\nother work and could not investigate properly. Any one here that has\r\nyellows in asters next year, we would be very glad to hear from him and\r\nsend some one out to find the cause. It wouldn't surprise me that it was\r\nsomething in the treatment of the aster.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadoo: Do angleworms hurt house plants?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Not as a rule. They do eat a small amount of vegetation, but\r\nordinarily in a house plant, if you have, say, a worm in a pot, I think\r\nit is rather beneficial than injurious, because it keeps the soil\r\nstirred up.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: What is the spray for the cabbage and onion maggot?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Unfortunately I am a very poor person to remember figures,\r\nand I carry this around with me. One spray is three ounces of lead\r\narsenate, two and a half pounds of brown sugar to four gallons of water,\r\nbut we found that probably a little better spray was to use the New\r\nOrleans molasses instead of the sugar and the formula is: One ounce of\r\nlead arsenate, one-half pint of New Orleans molasses and one gallon of\r\nwater. The spray that was used for the onion maggot and was devised over\r\nin Wisconsin is: One-fifth ounce of sodium arsenite, one-half pint of\r\nNew Orleans molasses and one gallon of water.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: The Wisconsin spray is what I used to spray my place\r\nseveral years, and I was wondering if it was the same.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: It was peculiar that they started to work on the onion maggot\r\nin Wisconsin at the same time we started on the cabbage maggot here.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen: We have controlled the onion maggots almost entirely, but\r\nthe cabbage maggots are very difficult.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: In our control plots it controlled it very well. Our plants\r\nwere infested only with a few maggots, but not sufficient to do any\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wealthy Apple.\r\n\r\nF. H. BALLOU.\r\n\r\n(THE OPINION OF AN OHIO APPLE GROWER--FROM A BULLETIN ISSUED BY OHIO\r\nSTATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of a variety of apple commercially usually decides its place\r\nin the estimation of growers. Naturally the later maturing, longer\r\nkeeping or winter varieties are generally accorded this preference.\r\nOrchardists in the southern part of Ohio doubtless would elect Rome\r\nBeauty queen of money makers, were the question put to a vote. Apple\r\nproducers of northern Ohio or western New York would as surely vote for\r\nBaldwin. But what variety would you--Mr. Lover-of-apples-and-apple\r\nproducts--vote for and plant if but a single variety and space for but a\r\nsingle tree were available? After twenty years observation and enjoyment\r\nof apple precocity, apple dependability and all-around apple excellence\r\nthroughout a long season, the writer continues annually to cast his\r\nballot for Wealthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Rolla Sfubbs, of Bederwood, Lake Minnetonka, under\r\nhis favorite tree, the Wealthy.]\r\n\r\nTrue the Wealthy has its faults--so have all the other varieties of\r\napples of individual choice--and so have we--the growers; but for early\r\nfruitage, prolificacy, excellence for culinary use, extended period of\r\nusefulness, richness and delicacy of flavor when ripened in a cool\r\ncellar and good keeping qualities when under proper conditions it is\r\nplaced in cold storage, there are few if any varieties other than this\r\nthat combine so many splendid and desirable characteristics. From\r\nmid-July to mid-September of the present year we have been using\r\nWealthy for culinary purposes with steadily increasing enjoyment as\r\ntheir quality has gradually become finer and finer. At this writing,\r\nSeptember 18, we have in the cellar attractively colored, well ripened,\r\npink-and-white-fleshed Wealthy delightful for dessert use; and there are\r\nyet Wealthy--firm and crisp--on the trees for later autumn use if kept\r\nin the cellar, or early winter and holiday use if placed in cold\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nIf we could have but one apple tree that tree would be a Wealthy. This\r\nstatement is made with full knowledge and appreciation of the many other\r\nexcellent varieties of various seasons, including Grimes, Jonathan,\r\nStayman and Delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw Fixes Standards for Containers for Fruits, Berries and Vegetables in\r\nInterstate Commerce.\r\n\r\n(TAKEN FROM \"WISCONSIN HORTICULTURE,\" THE ORGAN OF WIS. STATE\r\nHORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nStandards for Climax baskets for grapes, other fruits and vegetables,\r\nand other types of baskets and containers used for small fruits,\r\nberries, and vegetables in interstate commerce, are fixed by an act\r\napproved by the President August 31, 1916. The law will become effective\r\nNovember 1, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the act will be to require the use of the standards in\r\nmanufacturing, sale, or shipment for all interstate commerce, whether\r\nthe containers are filled or unfilled. A large part of the traffic in\r\nfruits and vegetables in this country enters interstate commerce. The\r\nlaw relates only to the containers and will not affect local regulations\r\nin regard to heaped measure or other method of filling. A special\r\nexemption from the operations of the law is made for all containers\r\nmanufactured, sold, or shipped, when intended for export to foreign\r\ncountries, and when such containers accord with the specifications of\r\nthe foreign purchasers, or comply with the laws of the country to which\r\nthe shipment is destined.\r\n\r\nStandards of three capacities are fixed for Climax baskets--2, 4 and 12\r\nquarts, dry measure. These containers, often known as \"grape baskets,\"\r\nhave relatively narrow, flat bottoms, rounded at each end, and thin\r\nsides flaring slightly from the perpendicular. The handle is hooped over\r\nat the middle from side to side. In addition to fixing the capacities of\r\nthese standard baskets of this type, the law also prescribes their\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nThe other standards are for \"baskets or other containers for small\r\nfruits, berries, and vegetables.\" They are to have capacities only of\r\none-half pint, 1 pint, 1 quart, or multiples of 1 quart, dry measure.\r\nSuch containers may be of any shape so long as their capacities\r\naccurately accord with the standard requirements.\r\n\r\nThe examination and test of containers to determine whether they comply\r\nwith the provisions of the act are made duties of the department, and\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture is empowered to establish and promulgate\r\nrules and regulations allowing such reasonable tolerances and variations\r\nas may be found necessary.\r\n\r\nPenalties are provided by the act for the manufacture for shipment, sale\r\nfor shipment, or shipment in interstate commerce of Climax baskets, and\r\ncontainers for small fruits, berries, and vegetables, not in accord with\r\nthe standards. It is provided, however:\r\n\r\nThat no dealer shall be prosecuted under the provisions of this act when\r\nhe can establish a guaranty signed by the manufacturer, wholesaler,\r\njobber, or other party residing within the United States from whom such\r\nClimax baskets, baskets, or other containers, as defined in this act,\r\nwere purchased, to the effect that said Climax baskets, baskets, or\r\nother containers are correct within the meaning of this act. Said\r\nguaranty, to afford protection, shall contain the name and address of\r\nthe party or parties making the sale of Climax baskets, baskets, or\r\nother containers, to such dealer, and in such case said party or parties\r\nshall be amenable to the prosecutions, fines, and other penalties which\r\nwould attach in due course to the dealer under the provisions of this\r\nact.--Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLANT-CHIMERA: TWO VARIETIES OF APPLE IN ONE.\r\n\r\nGolden Russet and Boston Stripe combined in the same fruit, as the\r\nresult of a graft. Trees producing these apples bear only a few fruits\r\nof this combination; the rest of the crop belongs entirely to one or\r\nother of the two varieties concerned. The explanation of these chimeras\r\nis that the original buds of the scion failed to grow, after the graft\r\nwas made, but an adventitious bud arose exactly at the juncture of stock\r\nand scion, and included cells derived from both. These cells grow side\r\nby side but remain quite distinct in the same stem, each kind of cell\r\nreproducing its own sort. From \"Journal of Heredity,\" May, 1914.\r\nPublished by the \"American Genetic Association,\" Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rhubarb Plant.\r\n\r\nLUDVIG MOSBAEK, ASKOV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRhubarb, or pieplant, as it is more commonly called, is one of the\r\nhardiest and at the same time a most delicious fruit. When the stalks\r\nare used at the right stage and given the proper care by the cook, they\r\nare almost equal to fresh peaches.\r\n\r\nRhubarb can be transplanted every month in the year, but the best time\r\nis early spring or August. There are especially two things rhubarb will\r\nnot stand, \"wet feet and deep planting.\" Most beneficial is good natural\r\nor artificial drainage and rich soil, made so by a good coat of manure,\r\nplowed or spaded in, and a liberal top dressing every fall, cultivated\r\nor hoed in on the top soil the next spring. Fifty plants or divisions of\r\na good tender variety planted 3 to 4 feet apart will supply an average\r\nhousehold with more delicious fresh fruit and juice for six months of\r\nthe year than five times the space of ground devoted to currants,\r\ngooseberries or any other fruit, and if you have from 50 to 100 plants\r\nyou can afford to pick the first stalk that sprouts up in April and\r\nstill figure on having an abundance to keep you well supplied all\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nDo you really know what a delicious beverage can be made from the juice\r\nof rhubarb mixed in cool water? Take it along in the hayfield a hot\r\nsummer day. And even if you can not keep it cool the acid contained in\r\nthe juice still makes it a delicious and stimulating drink where you\r\nwould loathe the taste of a stale beer. There are about a hundred other\r\nways to prepare rhubarb, not forgetting a well cooled rhubarb mush\r\nserved with cool milk in the evening or for that matter three times a\r\nday; nothing cheaper, nor healthier. The fresh acid contained in the\r\nrhubarb purifies the blood and puts new vigor in your body and soul, is\r\nbetter and cheaper than any patent medicines, and from the growth of 50\r\nto 100 plants you can eat every day for six months and preserve enough\r\nin fresh, cool water in airtight jars to last you all winter. But you\r\ncan do still better with your rhubarb. You can add three months more and\r\nmake it nine months of the year for fresh, crisp, delicious fruit. I\r\nwill tell you how.\r\n\r\nWhen your rhubarb gets 3-4 years old and very big and strong clumps of\r\nroots, divide some of the best and make a new planting and dig some of\r\nthe balance before frost in the fall. Leave them on top of the ground\r\nuntil they have had a good freeze--this is very essential to\r\nsuccess--then place the roots as you dug them in a dark corner in your\r\ncellar or in a barrel in your cellar, exclude all light, keep the soil\r\nmoderately wet and after Christmas and until spring you will have an\r\nabundance of brittle, fine flavored stalks that are fully equal to and\r\nperhaps more tender than the outdoor grown. Years ago in Chicago I grew\r\nrhubarb in a dark house 36×80 ft., built for that purpose, and the\r\nstalks generally commanded a price of 12 to 15c a pound in the right\r\nmarket in January, February and March.\r\n\r\nIt is better not to pull any stalks the summer you transplant, at least\r\nnot until September. Next year in May and June you can have stalks from\r\n1/2 to 1 pound and over. When you pull stalks don't take the outer two\r\nor three leaves but only the tender ones, and strip them off in\r\nsuccession so you do not come back to the same plants to pull for four\r\nto six weeks or more. Just as quick as the plant shows flower stems cut\r\nthem off close to the ground and keep them off, never allow them to show\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nI have grown rhubarb for market and for domestic use for about forty\r\nyears, having one time as much as five acres, and I will assure you if\r\nyou will follow directions you will appreciate rhubarb more than before\r\nand get out of it all it is worth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTREES PLANTED BY MACHINE.--A machine which plants from ten to\r\nfifteen thousand forest trees seedlings a day is now being used at the\r\nLetchworth Park Forest and Arboretum, in Wyoming County, N. Y.,\r\naccording to officials of the Forest Service who are acting as advisers\r\nin the work. Previously the planting had been done by hand at the rate\r\nof 1,200 to 1,500 trees each day per man.\r\n\r\nThe machine was designed to set out cabbage and tomato plants, but works\r\nequally well with trees. It is about the size of an ordinary mowing\r\nmachine and is operated by three men and two horses. One man drives the\r\nteam while the other two handle the seedlings. The machine makes a\r\nfurrow in which the trees are set at any desired distance, and an\r\nautomatic device indicates where they should be dropped. Two metal-tired\r\nwheels push and roll the dirt firmly down around the roots. This is a\r\nvery desirable feature, it is said, because the trees are apt to die if\r\nthis is not well done. Two attachments make it possible to place water\r\nand fertilizer at the roots of each seedling. Another attachment marks\r\nthe line on which the next row of trees is to be planted.\r\n\r\nNo cost figures are available yet, but officials say that the cost will\r\nbe much less than when the planting is done by hand. It is stated that\r\nthe machine can be used on any land which has been cleared and is not\r\ntoo rough to plow and harrow.--U. S. Dept. Agri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greenhouse versus Hotbeds.\r\n\r\nFRANK H. GIBBS, MARKET GARDENER, ST. ANTHONY PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing the subject assigned me, I will only speak of hotbeds and\r\nhothouses as used for the purpose of growing vegetables and early\r\nvegetable plants.\r\n\r\nThe hotbed is still very desirable where it is wanted on a small scale\r\nto grow early vegetables for the home or market, as the small cost for\r\nan outfit is very small as compared to hothouses. Sash 4×5 ft., which is\r\nthe favorite size with market gardeners, can be purchased for about\r\n$2.00 each glazed, and a box 5×16 ft. to hold four sash can be made for\r\n$1.50, making an outlay less than $10.00 for 80 sq. ft. of bed. With\r\ngood care sash and boxes will last eight years.\r\n\r\nWhere the beds are put down in early February two crops of lettuce and\r\none crop of cucumbers can be grown, and when the spring is late three\r\ncrops of lettuce before outdoor lettuce appears on the market, when the\r\nbeds are given over entirely to the cucumber crop. Lettuce at that time\r\ngenerally sells for 25c per dozen, and cucumbers from 50c down to 15c\r\nper dozen, according to the season. From three to five hundred cabbage,\r\ncauliflower or lettuce plants can be grown under each sash, or from 150\r\nto 300 tomatoes, peppers or egg plants can likewise be grown under each\r\nsash, or where lettuce is grown to maturity six dozen per sash.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the horse manure for the beds varies greatly, as some are\r\nsituated where it can be secured very reasonably, while with others the\r\ncost would be prohibitive. The amount required also varies according to\r\nthe season they are put down. When the beds are put down early in\r\nFebruary, three cords of manure are necessary for each box. When they\r\nare put down March 1st, one-half that amount is needed. Where there is\r\nno desire to get the early market, and the beds are put down March 15th,\r\none cord is plenty for each box. I have never tried to figure out just\r\nwhat the cost of putting down each box is, or what is the cost of\r\nventilating and watering; but if they are neglected and the plants get\r\nburned or frozen, the cost is much more than if they were given proper\r\nattention, and, besides, much time is lost in getting another start, as\r\nthey are generally left several days to see if the plants will recover,\r\nwhich they seldom do.\r\n\r\nThe cost of hothouses varies so greatly for the size of the house that\r\nit is hard to draw a comparison. A modern steel frame house containing\r\n10,000 sq. ft. of glass can be built for about $4,000.00, or a house\r\none-half that size can be built for $10,000.00 and is no better than its\r\ncheaper rival. A small house say 16×80 ft., heated with a brick furnace\r\nand flue and hot water coil can be built for from $350.00 to $400.00,\r\nwhere one does not have to hire skilled labor. A hothouse of any size is\r\nvery satisfactory, as in cold, stormy weather, when we can't even look\r\ninto a hotbed, plants can be kept growing and there is always something\r\nwe can do and be comfortable while we are doing it. It is impossible to\r\nuse a hotbed all winter, as no matter how much manure is put into it in\r\nthe fall it will cool out and be worthless long before spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing hotbeds and greenhouse at F. H. Gibbs' market\r\ngardens.]\r\n\r\nWith a good hothouse four crops of lettuce can be raised during the fall\r\nand winter, and a crop of cucumbers in the spring and early summer.\r\n\r\nEach crop of lettuce sells for from 20c to 25c per dozen; the plants are\r\nset six inches apart each way, making about four per square foot of\r\nbench room.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber crop generally pays as well as two crops of lettuce and is\r\nusually planted to come into bearing early in June and kept bearing\r\nthrough July, or until the outdoor cucumbers are on the market. In the\r\nso-called summer just passed (1915), there were no outdoor cucumbers,\r\nand they were kept bearing through August and September. Cucumbers grown\r\nin hotbeds cannot be kept in bearing more than six weeks before the\r\nvines go to pieces and will not sell for as high a price as hothouse\r\ngrown. With favorable weather I have always thought I could grow a crop\r\nof lettuce in less time in a hotbed than in a hothouse, but with cold,\r\ncloudy weather the advantage is on the side of the hothouse. Much less\r\ntime is required to do the ventilating and watering in a hothouse than\r\nwith beds, and the soil must be in the highest state of fertility for\r\neither one.\r\n\r\nWhile hotbeds will always be desirable in many localities on account of\r\nthe small first cost, the days of the large commercial hotbed yard is\r\npassed, and there are now around Minneapolis 5,000 hotbed sash that will\r\nnot be put down next spring, or if put down, used only on cold frames,\r\nall owing to the scarcity of fresh horse manure.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a great satisfaction to have a hothouse or hotbeds and grow\r\nvegetables in winter, the life of the market gardener is not one\r\ncontinuous round of pleasure, as lice, white fly, red spider and thrip,\r\nmildew and fungous rot are always ready for a fight, and the gardener\r\nmust always be on his guard and beat them to it at their first\r\nappearance, or the labor of weeks will be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ideal Flower Garden for a Country Home.\r\n\r\nM. H. WETHERBEE, FLORIST, CHARLES CITY, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn laying out grounds for country homes or remodeling them, space should\r\nbe of the first importance, and where space permits there is no better\r\narrangement than a fine border on one side of the lawn with a driveway\r\nbetween the lawn and the border, leading from the street to the house\r\nand barns. The border should be wide enough to have a nice variety of\r\nshrubs for a background, and there should be space for the hardy\r\nperennials and bulbs, which should not be planted solidly but placed in\r\nclumps and arranged according to height and blooming season and as to\r\ncolor effect.\r\n\r\nI will mention a few of the hardy shrubs and plants that we can all grow\r\nwith success. While the catalogues are filled with a large list of\r\nso-called hardy stock, we must remember that we live in a good sized\r\ncountry and what would be hardy in Southern Iowa, Missouri and Illinois,\r\nwould not stand the winters of Northern Iowa or of Minnesota or other\r\nlocalities of the same latitude. In shrubs we can be sure of a variety\r\nof lilacs, snowballs, and hydrangea paniculata. Some of the newer\r\nvarieties are fine and bloom in August, when few other shrubs are\r\nflowering. Spirea Van Houttii, best known as Bridal Wreath, we might\r\ninclude and a few of the hardy vines if a trellis or other support was\r\ngiven for them, such as clematis paniculata, coccinea and jackmani, the\r\nlarge purple and white honeysuckle, Chinese matrimony vine, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong hardy roses, which are called the queen of all flowers, are the\r\nRugosa type, which will stand the winters with no protection and\r\ncontinue to flower all summer. While the flowers of that type are single\r\nor semi-double, the bushes would be handsome without any flowers. This\r\ntype also produces hips, which adds to their attractiveness, and these\r\nmay be made into jelly in the fall if so desired. I would advise to\r\nplant some of the most hardy of the hybrid perpetual roses, such as\r\nGeneral Jacqueminot, Magna Charta, Mrs. Chas. Wood, Mrs. John Lang, Mad.\r\nPlantier, with some of the climbers, such as the Rambler in variety,\r\nPrairie Queen, Baltimore Belle and, perhaps, some others, with the\r\nunderstanding that the hybrids and climbers should have protection in\r\nsome form for the winter months.\r\n\r\nThen in hardy perennials there is such a variety to select from that one\r\nhardly knows where to begin or when to stop. Of course everyone wants a\r\nfew peonies, and some of the hardy phlox, in such a variety of color.\r\nThen the delphinium, or hardy larkspurs, are fine bloomers. The blue and\r\nwhite platycodon are sure to flower, while the German iris are good and\r\nthe Japan iris are fine flowers, but have to have good protection to\r\nstand our winters. For fine white flowers we have the showy achilleas in\r\nvariety and gypsophila paniculata, called baby breath as a common name.\r\nThen we must have plenty of space for a variety of annuals, such as\r\nsweet peas, cosmos, pansies, verbenas, etc. Also, we would grow\r\ngeraniums in variety, a few summer carnations, and the selection can be\r\nlarge or small, but almost every one will want some dahlia and gladiolus\r\nbulbs. Those that like yellow, or lemon, lilies can plant them and have\r\na mass of flowers during June. The Japan lilies, especially the rubrum\r\nvariety, are good bloomers and quite hardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Planting and Care of Hardy Perennials.\r\n\r\nMISS GRACE E. KIMBALL, WALTHAM. (SO. MINN. HORT. SOCIETY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important essential in the planting of hardy perennials is the\r\npreparation of the ground. It must be deeply spaded or plowed and\r\nthoroughly pulverized. While most kinds of plants will do well in any\r\ngood garden soil, most gardens need more or less fertilizer to make the\r\nground good garden soil. So it is well at the time of spading or plowing\r\nto see that enough fertilizer is applied to insure good growth and\r\nblossom. But care must be used that no fresh stable manure comes in\r\ncontact with the roots. If it must be used see that it is put in the\r\nbottom of the hole or trench dug for the plants, and covered several\r\ninches with earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground is well prepared and properly fertilized comes the\r\nplanting, and as many plants need somewhat different handling, it is\r\nwell for one starting a garden to understand just how each kind should\r\nbe set. The iris, for instance, likes to be very near the surface of the\r\nground. In fact it seems to delight in pushing the earth off the fleshy\r\npart of the root and basking in the sun, while the small roots lie very\r\nclose to the surface. The oriental poppy must be planted with the crown\r\nwell above the ground, or else when any moisture settles on it the crown\r\nwill rot, and the plant die. The gaillardia, larkspur and columbine\r\nshould be planted about as the oriental poppy with the crowns perhaps\r\nnot quite as much above the ground, while the peony should be set so\r\nthat the bud is covered two or three inches.\r\n\r\nSince fall planting of herbaceous perennials has come into prominence\r\none can choose either spring or fall for most of their planting, as most\r\nplants do well set at either time. But the oriental poppy does not ship\r\nnor transplant well in the spring. It dies down after blossoming--one\r\nmay think they have lost their plants then--and starts up again in\r\nAugust or September. Just as it is starting then seems to be the safest\r\ntime to plant.\r\n\r\nAugust and September are considered the best months to do fall planting,\r\nalthough some advocate setting peonies until it freezes. Still I think\r\nit safer to plant earlier than that.\r\n\r\nIf I were beginning a hardy garden, one that I could add to from time to\r\ntime, I would try to set out in the fall plants that bloom in the spring\r\nor early summer, and in the spring those that bloom in the fall. Nothing\r\nis gained by setting iris or peonies in the spring, for nine times out\r\nof ten they will not bloom the same season they are set, while if set in\r\nthe fall nearly all varieties of either the iris or peony will bloom the\r\nnext year. On the other hand, phlox set in the spring scarcely ever\r\nfails to bloom in the late summer or early fall, and keeps it up until\r\nfreezing weather. The phlox, however, should be taken up and divided\r\nevery two or three years to obtain the best results.\r\n\r\nAfter planting comes the cultivating, which should be kept up all\r\nsummer. Especially after a rain should the ground be stirred to keep it\r\nfrom baking. In exceedingly dry seasons by keeping a dust mulch around\r\nthe plants one can avoid having to do much watering--for unless you\r\nwater thoroughly at such a time it is better not to water at all.\r\nHowever, if it finally becomes necessary to apply water, the dust mulch\r\nhas kept the ground in condition to absorb all the water that is used.\r\n\r\nIn the fall after the ground has frozen a light covering of some kind\r\nshould be thrown over the plants. This is to protect them from the\r\nthawing and freezing that takes place from time to time during the\r\nwinter and early spring. After the first year, when the foliage has\r\nincreased so as to be some protection, it is not as necessary to cover,\r\nalthough no doubt a little more covering would be beneficial. Some\r\ngrowers of the peony, however, advocate cutting off the leaves in the\r\nfall, and in such a case a covering would be necessary.\r\n\r\nWe found a very satisfactory way for both covering and fertilizing was\r\nto throw a fork full of dressing around each plant in the fall and work\r\nit into the ground in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM--J. F. BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nPASSED JULY 15, 1916. AGED 59 YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"John Franklin Benjamin was born at Belvidere, Illinois, May 6, 1857.\r\nThat same year his parents moved to Hutchinson and he, at the age of\r\nfive years, was one of the two score of little children who spent hours\r\nof terror in the stockade when it was attacked by the Indians on\r\nSeptember 4, 1862. As he grew up he attended the Hutchinson school, his\r\nboyhood being spent on the farm. He was married in October, 1889, to\r\nMinnie L. Walker. The following year they moved to Pierce county, Neb.,\r\nwhere Mr. Benjamin purchased and for ten years managed a large ranch. In\r\n1890 they returned to Hutchinson and proceeded to open and improve\r\nHighland Home Fruit Farm, which was thenceforth Mr. Benjamin's abiding\r\nplace until the summons came that ended all his earthly hopes and plans.\r\n\r\n\"He was an active factor in farmers' co-operative society affairs and\r\nsupported all movements for the moral and educational uplift of the\r\ncommunity. He had been for many years a member of the M. E. church and\r\nof the Woodmen's and Royal Neighbors' camps and a valued and active\r\nmember of each of these societies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Franklin Benjamin.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Benjamin left no children, and the wife who has been his devoted\r\nhelpmate for twenty-seven years survives to face the coming years of\r\nbereavement alone.\r\n\r\n\"His had been a useful life, a life of ceaseless and honorable toil,\r\nand that beautiful and valuable property, Highland Home Fruit Farm,\r\nlargely the product of the work of his own hands, is a monument to his\r\nmemory which will long endure to be admired and enjoyed by others as one\r\nof the model rural places of Minnesota. Few men in the space of\r\ntwenty-five years have accomplished more than did J. F. Benjamin in\r\nestablishing the fine, modern home, the large orchard and small fruit\r\nand flower gardens and well stocked farm, all of which he had tended\r\nwith loving hands.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin was well known by the members of this society who have\r\nattended its annual meetings within the last ten or fifteen years.\r\nDuring this period he has been an active member of the society, often\r\nserving on the program or in some other way as opportunity came to him.\r\nHe was one of the most loyal members of the association, practicing what\r\nhe preached, and doing all within his power to extend the usefulness of\r\nthe society. I had a close personal acquaintance with Mr. Benjamin and\r\nthe highest respect for his character and attainments. As a\r\ncomparatively young man we anticipated his presence with us for a long\r\nperiod of time, but in this we are sadly disappointed. His wife in a\r\nrecent letter says, \"One of his greatest pleasures was cultivating and\r\ntaking care of the flowers which surrounded his home. After a hard day's\r\nwork in the field, he would labor with his flowers and shrubbery until\r\nfar into the night. He enjoyed taking or sending flowers to the sick,\r\nand many bouquets of his choicest blossoms he gave his friends as they\r\ndrove past or called to admire his beautiful grounds.\" In this spirit\r\nMr. Benjamin labored to reach others and widen the wholesome influence\r\nof his life.--Sec'y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM 50th ANNUAL MEETING\r\n\r\nOur Semi-Centennial Anniversary\r\n\r\nMinnesota State Horticultural Society,\r\n\r\nTo be held in the West Hotel, Minneapolis, December 5, 6, 7, 8, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Great Program.\r\n\r\nStudy this program carefully and select such features as you especially\r\ndesire to participate in--but you are more than welcome to all.\r\n\r\nDiscussion follows each topic.\r\n\r\nDiscussions are \"free for all,\" whether members or not.

Garden Flower Society will be\r\nheld Wednesday morning at 10:00 o'clock in an adjoining room.\r\n\r\nAre you a member of the Garden Flower Society? If you are growing\r\nflowers you should join it at once. Consult the secretary, Mrs. M.

E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden Flower Society will have an all-day meeting at the\r\nAgricultural College the first Friday in January next. This meeting is\r\nto be held with the session of the Farmers' Short Course in Room 20,\r\nHorticultural Building. Arrangements will be made so that lunches may be\r\nhad on the grounds, probably at the dining hall.\r\n\r\nThe program covers a wide range of subjects, and as time will be given\r\nfor discussion and answering of questions brought up, this will prove a\r\nmost helpful meeting to all of our members.\r\n\r\nOur own annual meeting will be held on Wednesday, December sixth. The\r\nbusiness meeting and election of officers being held in the morning, the\r\nprogram in the afternoon--at the West Hotel--in connection with the\r\nHorticultural Society.\r\n\r\nWill not each member make an especial effort to bring in a new member at\r\nthat time or before? The only reason we have not a thousand members is\r\nbecause we and our work are so little known. If you will tell your\r\nfriends who have gardens what we are doing, you will have no difficulty\r\nin helping us add to our membership. Since last January we have received\r\nsixty-six new members. Can't we make it an even hundred for this year?\r\nWith _your help_, we _can_. The program for our annual meeting will be\r\nfound in the official program, printed elsewhere in this number. Here is\r\nthe program for the meeting at the Agricultural College, Friday, January\r\n5th. Come and bring your garden problems with you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Program for Meeting, January 5, 1917, 10 a.m., Agricultural College.)\r\n\r\n1.

It will be\r\none of the bright spots in your life, as you recall the pleasures of\r\nthis great and fruitful gathering.\r\n\r\nANNUAL SOCIETY BANQUET.--Special pains have been taken in\r\npreparing the program for this banquet on account of the fact that this\r\nis our anniversary session in part, and you will not be disappointed if\r\nyou anticipate a rich treat, with two or three hundred of the most\r\ncongenial people on earth, who will sit down to supper together at the\r\nWest Hotel at 6:30 p. m., Thursday, December 7th,--a wholesome repast\r\nand an intellectual feast, don't miss it. You will feel that you really\r\nbelong to the brotherhood after dining with us.\r\n\r\nDELEGATES TO THE ANNUAL MEETING.--Besides the delegates at our\r\nannual meeting from abroad referred to in the November number, there is\r\nto be with us also as representative of the Iowa State Horticultural\r\nSociety, Mr. P. F. Kinne, of Storm Lake, Iowa. We have pretty good\r\nassurance also that Secy. Greene, of the Iowa Society, will visit with\r\nus at some time during the meeting, and we don't know how many more of\r\nthe good Iowa people will find their way here. A late note from Chas. G.\r\nPatten assures us of his attendance at the meeting, when he will give us\r\na full report of his experimental work in growing seedling pears at his\r\nstation at Charles City, Iowa. We are looking forward confidently to\r\nsomething of large practical value from his work.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OF ANNUAL MEETING.--The program of the coming annual\r\nmeeting of the society will be found in an abbreviated form in this\r\nnumber of our magazine. It has been sent, however, in all its\r\ncompleteness, in a separate enclosure to all the members of the society,\r\naccompanied by a blank form to be filled out by members who purpose to\r\nattend and desire to have their names in the Badge Book, and also for\r\nthose who renew their memberships. Quite a number of questions are asked\r\non this blank form, and it is important that they should all be\r\nanswered. It is especially important that the names of friends whom you\r\nwould like to see members of the society should be given to the\r\nsecretary on these blanks and at an early date so that copies of the\r\nprogram can be sent them in good season.\r\n\r\nThe program, as you will note, is an exceedingly diversified one,\r\nspecial emphasis being laid on orcharding, vegetable growing and\r\nornamental horticulture. An increasing interest in flower growing is\r\nemphasized by the programs of three auxiliary societies devoted to these\r\nbranches of horticulture.\r\n\r\n_Aren't you coming to this splendid meeting?_ Study the program and\r\nconsider the advantages of intercourse and companionship with those who\r\nhave so much in common as the members of the Horticultural Society.\r\nDon't fail to _attend promptly the first session_, which is always a\r\nfull one, right on the minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNAL OF ANNUAL MEETING, 1915\r\n\r\nMinnesota State Horticultural Society\r\n\r\nHeld on Second Floor of the West Hotel, Minneapolis, December 7, 8, 9\r\nand 10, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday Morning Session, 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMeeting was opened at 10 o'clock a.m., December 7, 1915, by President\r\nThomas E. Cashman. Invocation was made by Rev. C. S. Harrison, of York,\r\nNebraska, which was followed by a song by Mr. Trafford N. Jayne, of\r\nMinneapolis. The president then read his annual greeting. (See index.)\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: How may University Farm and the Minnesota State\r\nHorticultural Society be mutually helpful in developing the farms and\r\nhomes of the Northwest? by our good friend, the dean of agriculture of\r\nthis state, Mr. A. F. Woods. (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: Anything further before we pass to the next subject?\r\nIf not, we will now call on one of our oldest members and one of our\r\nbest friends, Mr. George J. Kellogg, of Wisconsin, who will tell us\r\nsomething about the strawberry business. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: I am sure we are all very much indebted to Mr.\r\nKellogg. Now, we have another very good friend with us from Nebraska. He\r\nis going to tell us about \"The Nurseryman as King.\" Mr. C. S. Harrison,\r\nof York, Nebraska. (See index.)\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: This morning we heard from our good friend, Dean\r\nWoods, then we heard from Wisconsin and later from Nebraska. We have\r\nenjoyed all three, all very instructive and very entertaining, and we\r\nhope to hear from them again. We hope later to hear from another\r\nWisconsin man, Mr. Philips. Those three men have always contributed a\r\ngreat deal to the success of our meetings. I understand that Wisconsin\r\nhas sent another representative, Mr. A. C. Graves, of Sturgeon Bay. It\r\nhas been announced that he is with us. If so, we will be pleased to have\r\nhim come forward and have a word of greeting from him, representing the\r\nWisconsin Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves: Mr. President and members of the Minnesota Horticultural\r\nSociety: I am very pleased to be here this morning and listen to this\r\nprogram and these deliberations. I expect to spend some enjoyable days\r\nwith you, and on behalf of the Wisconsin Horticultural Society I am\r\npleased to bring to you their greetings on this occasion. Thank you.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: We hope to hear from you later, Mr. Graves, and would\r\nbe pleased to have you take part in our deliberations. I presume that\r\nthere are other delegates here, but if so they have not been announced.\r\nIf there are others I hope they will hand their credentials to the\r\nsecretary so we may call on them later.\r\n\r\nMeeting adjourned until 1:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 7, 1915, Afternoon Session.\r\n\r\n_The Minnesota Orchard._ Discussion led by J. P. Andrews, Faribault,\r\nMinn. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Ladies and gentlemen, the time has now arrived to\r\ncontinue with the regular proceedings of the society. Mr. Rasmussen,\r\npresident of the Wisconsin State Horticultural Society, is with us and\r\nwill be on the program later, but we will have a few words from him now.\r\n(Applause.).\r\n\r\nMr. Rasmussen (Wisconsin): Mr. President and members of the Minnesota\r\nHorticultural Society: I didn't expect to be caught this way. I was\r\ngoing to be real shrewd, I was not going to let you know I was coming. I\r\ntold the secretary of our society not to let you know I was coming, but\r\nhe notified your secretary that I was coming and that is the way they\r\nhappened to get me on the program. I was going to sneak in and get all\r\nthe good out of it and was not going to give anything back; I will admit\r\nthat is not a fair game. I feel about like a fellow who had to make a\r\ntalk at a banquet. He said he was not a speaker, but they insisted. They\r\nwould not let him back out. So he got up and feeling kind of shaky, like\r\nI am now, he reached his hand down to get hold of his chair, as he\r\nthought, but touched his wife's shoulder, and she got up. She thought\r\nshe had to. He started, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this thing was forced on\r\nme. (Laughter.)\" So this was kind of forced upon me. I know that your\r\nprogram is full so I will not detain you any longer. My time is\r\ntomorrow, and I will take you through my garden tomorrow. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: We are all pleased to have Mr. Rasmussen with us, and we\r\nhope we will hear from him often during the deliberations of the\r\nmeeting. I was pleased indeed to see so many present this forenoon.\r\nSecretary Latham thought he had plenty of room for all who might attend,\r\nbut I don't think there was a vacant chair here this forenoon. I was\r\npleased indeed to note so many new faces, so many young men present. You\r\nare the people we want to see. The older men have always contributed and\r\ndone their part and have made these meetings a grand success, but it\r\nwill soon devolve upon the younger men of this society to take their\r\nplaces. We want you to help them at these meetings, and I was glad that\r\nyou did so this forenoon. We hope that the young men will feel at home\r\nand that they will continue to take part, that they will ask questions\r\nand tell us about their successes and their failures, and I hope the\r\nolder members will help make it pleasant for these young men.\r\n\r\nWe will take up the subject of fruits this afternoon, and I am now going\r\nto call on a plum specialist, a man that we look to to tell us about the\r\nplum troubles in this state, Mr. Dewain Cook, who will tell us about the\r\n\"Plums We Already Have and Plums That Are on the Way--the Brown Rot a\r\nControlling Factor,\" Mr. Dewain Cook, of Jeffers, Minnesota. (See\r\nindex.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: We have heard of some of the troubles of those that plant\r\nplum trees. The next speaker will probably tell us how to meet those\r\ntroubles, how to combat the plum pocket fungus. We are fortunate to have\r\nwith us a scientific man that makes a study of these subjects. I refer\r\nto Professor Stakman, of the University Farm, St. Paul. \"The Control and\r\nCure of Brown Rot, etc.,\" by Prof. E. C. Stakman. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: I will now call on Mr. C. A. Pfeiffer, of Winona, to talk\r\nto us on \"The Surprise Plum a Success.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: \"Thirty Years in Raspberries,\" by a gentleman that knows\r\nhow to make money by the raising of raspberries, Mr. Gust. Johnson, of\r\nMinneapolis. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: We will now call upon Mr. Simmons to tell us about \"My\r\nOrchard Crop of 1915--from Start to Finish.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: As you know, Mr. Simmons is one of the most successful\r\norchardists in Minnesota. Do you wish to ask him any questions?\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: We are very much indebted to Mr. Simmons for this splendid\r\npaper and for his advice. We must hurry on to the next subject, which is\r\n\"Fruit Growing a Successful Industry in Minnesota,\" by A. W. Richardson,\r\nHoward Lake, Minn. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I am sure you will all agree this was a very instructive\r\nand interesting paper. We have about three minutes in which to discuss\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nTwo lantern talks followed--one by Earl Ferris of Hampton, Ia., on\r\n\"Evergreens,\" and one by A. G. Tolaas on \"Diseases of the Potato.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 8, 1915, Morning Session.\r\n\r\nDiscussion on \"The Vegetable Garden,\" led by H. J. Baldwin, Northfield,\r\nMinn. (See index.)\r\n\r\nN. H. Reeves, president Minneapolis Market Gardeners' Association, in\r\nthe chair.\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: We will now have a paper on \"Growing Beans and Sweet\r\nCorn,\" by P. B. Marien, of St. Paul. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: We will now listen to a paper on \"Growing Vegetables for\r\nCanning,\" by Mr. M. H. Hegerle, president of Canning Company, St.\r\nBonifacius. Mr. Hegerle not being present, we will ask Mr. Rasmussen,\r\npresident of the Wisconsin Horticultural Society, to tell us \"How We\r\nGrow Vegetables in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\" (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: Is Mr. Hegerle in the room?\r\n\r\nMr. Hegerle: Yes.\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: Then we will listen to Mr. Hegerle's talk on \"Growing\r\nVegetables for Canning.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: \"Greenhouse vs. Hotbeds, Investment, Care and Result\r\nCompared,\" by Mr. F. H. Gibbs. (See index.)\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: \"Growing the Tomato,\" by C. W. Purdham, market\r\ngardener, Brooklyn Center. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: We will now listen to a paper by E. W. Record on\r\n\"Asparagus by the Acre.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nPresident Reeves: You will be entertained with a demonstration of the\r\ncoldpack method of canning fruits and vegetables by Professor R. S.\r\nMackintosh and Miss Mary L. Bull.\r\n\r\nAfter the demonstration the session adjourned until 1:30 o'clock p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 8, 1915, Afternoon Session.\r\n\r\nQuestion and answer exercise on \"The Flower Garden,\" led by Mr. G. C.\r\nHawkins, of Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nThe President: I regret to have to announce that one of the big guns who\r\nwas to be with us on this afternoon's program, Professor J. C. Whitten,\r\nof Missouri, is unable to be with us on account of sickness. Secretary\r\nLatham received a letter from him just a short time ago, stating that he\r\nwas sick abed and the doctor would not permit him to leave. We have\r\nanother very able gentleman whom I will call upon at this time to take\r\nMr. Whitten's place. His name is H. G. Street, of Hebron, Ill., who will\r\ntell us about \"Marketing Fruit Direct.\" (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: We appreciate very much this fine paper by Mr. Street. We\r\nhave another very important subject this afternoon. We will have a paper\r\nby Mr. W. G. Brierly, Assistant Horticulturist at the University Farm,\r\non \"The Manufacture of Cider Vinegar on the Farm.\" (Applause.) (See\r\nindex.)\r\n\r\nReading by Miss Mary Bonn.\r\n\r\nThe President: We will now turn the meeting over to the Garden Flower\r\nSociety and request the president, Mrs. Ruff, to take the chair. (In the\r\nabsence of Mrs. Ruff, Mrs. E. W. Gould presided.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Our first number will be a paper on the Minnesota State\r\nFlower, by Mr. E. A. Smith, of Lake City. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: I wish to add one word to the name of my paper and that is\r\n\"Flag,\" so that it will read \"Minnesota State Flower and State Flag.\" I\r\nhave the two subjects so closely associated that I can not separate\r\nthem. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: I now come to the point in my paper. I move you, Madam\r\nPresident, that the Minnesota State Horticultural Society and its\r\nauxiliary societies through its secretary present the following\r\nresolution to the next legislature of the state for adoption at that\r\ntime: Resolved, that, whereas the State of Minnesota has adopted a state\r\nflower which, on account of its being a native of the woods and bogs, is\r\nnot generally known or recognized and, whereas, the State of Minnesota\r\nin 1893 adopted by legislative vote a state flag, which emblem is not\r\ngenerally known to the residents of the state, and believing that\r\nfamiliarity with the state flower and the state flag will do good and\r\ncreate loyalty to the state and Union, be it resolved, that we, the\r\nMinnesota State Horticultural Society and auxiliary societies, do hereby\r\npetition and pray the state legislature of Minnesota to have printed an\r\nattractive picture of the state flower and the state flag, properly\r\nframed, and present a copy of it to each public school of the state with\r\nthe request that it be placed upon the walls of the school room, also\r\nthat it be furnished free of cost to such other public buildings as may\r\nbe deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nI trust, Madam President, that this resolution will not only be seconded\r\nbut it will meet with the unanimous approval of the society.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: I do not know that we could vote with the Horticultural\r\nSociety. This is not a meeting of that society but simply a meeting of\r\nthe Flower Society. Will some one enlighten me?\r\n\r\nMiss White: Madam President, if we could not vote as a society, could we\r\nnot vote to recommend this resolution to the Horticultural Society?\r\n\r\nA Member: Yes, or to the two societies to be taken up at their business\r\nmeeting, perhaps.\r\n\r\nMiss White: Recommend it be passed by the parent society.\r\n\r\nA Member: Madam President, why should it not be the flag itself and not\r\na picture of the flag?\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Will you make that motion?\r\n\r\nMiss White: I move that the resolution as presented by Mr. Smith be\r\nendorsed by this Garden Flower Society and referred to the parent\r\nsociety for their adoption. I will offer that as a substitute.\r\n\r\nA Member: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nMotion was carried.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Our next subject is \"The Pergola, Its Use and Misuse, Its\r\nConvenience and Expense,\" by Charles H. Ramsdell, of Minneapolis. (See\r\nindex.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Our next paper is \"Hardy Perennials,\" by Miss Grace E.\r\nKimball, of Waltham. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: This spring our president, Mrs. Ruff, offered prizes for the\r\nbest papers on planting for color effect. The judges after reading these\r\npapers carefully selected three. Miss Starr is first, Mrs. Tillotson\r\nsecond and Mrs. Boyington third. These papers will now be read, Miss\r\nStarr giving the first one. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Mrs. Tillotson will follow with her paper. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Mrs. Wyman will read Mrs. Boyington's paper. Mrs. Boyington\r\nwas unable to be with us today. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Mrs. Countryman will read a paper written by Mr. Swanson on\r\nthe judging of flowers. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Gould: Our meeting will close with Professor Washburn's talk on\r\n\"Bird Conservation,\" which will be given with slides and music.\r\n\r\nProfessor Washburn gives lantern talk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 9, 1915, Morning Session.\r\n\r\nHalf hour question and answer exercise on \"Truck Crop and Garden\r\nInsects,\" led by Professor Wm. Moore. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: The committee on fruit list has been working very hard\r\ntrying to determine why we have particular varieties on the list and the\r\nchanges, if any, that should be made. Mr. J. P. Andrews, the chairman of\r\nthe committee, is the man who has been doing most of this work, and we\r\nwill be glad to hear from him at this time. He is quite radical and in\r\nfavor of many changes as you will note when he reads his report.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: There are very few changes, and you know it has been the\r\npolicy of this society rather to be conservative and not jump at\r\nanything until we know what it is. (Reads new fruit list.)\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I move its adoption.\r\n\r\nMotion was seconded and carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I would like to call attention to the fact that a great\r\nmany criticize that we do not change the list from time to time. I have\r\nthought that for a long time. Two or three years ago there was a little\r\nmove towards making it so we could change it. We are putting up some\r\nnice, big premiums for late winter apples and early winter apples, and\r\nthere are undoubtedly some seedlings that would be all right to put upon\r\nthe list if we knew more about them. It seems to me it is foolish to pay\r\nthose premiums and then drop it right there. We do not know any more\r\nabout whether they are hardy or not than if they had been grown in\r\nMissouri. They may have grown well through some protection or favorable\r\nlocation, but when you commence grafting from a seedling it does not\r\ngive satisfaction as a grafted tree and in different localities of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe want to know whether the new seedlings are hardy enough for this\r\nclimate, not that they are simply of good quality to eat and perhaps\r\nwill keep. We find that out here, but we do not find out anything about\r\nthe hardiness.\r\n\r\nI think we ought to require a person who has produced a good seedling\r\nand gotten a good premium for it to send some of its scions to the\r\nsuperintendent of the Fruit-Breeding Farm for testing and let him send\r\nit out to points north of here, between here and the northern part of\r\nthe state, to see how much hardiness it has. Hardiness is the quality we\r\nwant more than anything else. We have gotten along so far with the\r\nHibernal, and we ought not to be so particular about quality as about\r\nhardiness. They ought to be required to give Mr. Haralson a few of the\r\nscions or buds so that he could try them there at the fruit-breeding\r\nfarm and send them out to more northern locations under number, so that\r\nthe originator will be just as well protected, and it will add so much\r\nto the value of the new seedling that he ought to be anxious to do it\r\ninstead of holding it back as is now done.\r\n\r\nI move you that we have some arrangement whereby those drawing the\r\npremiums for the first and second qualities, keeping qualities and\r\neating qualities, etc., shall be obliged to give to Mr. Haralson\r\nsomething to work on, either scions or buds of those varieties, so that\r\nthey can be tested in that way and we know what they are, otherwise it\r\nleaves it for any one to introduce a new variety just about on the same\r\nground that some other varieties have been introduced in the state, made\r\na nice, large thing for the man that introduced them to the public and\r\nsold them but afterwards proved a great disappointment to almost every\r\nman who ever planted them. I move that we make such an arrangement, and\r\nwe recommend that the state fair do the same.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nThe President: It is moved and seconded that some arrangement be made\r\nrequiring people who enter seedling apples for prizes at the\r\nhorticultural meeting and the state fair to furnish scions or buds of\r\nsuch varieties to the central station to Superintendent Charles Haralson\r\nthat he may determine whether the trees are hardy and suitable for this\r\nclimate or not.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: We need this provision so that Superintendent Haralson\r\ncould visit those trees and see what they looked like.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: I move that this matter be referred to the executive board\r\nto develop a workable plan to secure the purposes which Mr. Andrews has\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nThe President: Do you accept that as a substitute?\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I would if it wasn't for this one thing. It was left that\r\nway a year or two ago, and it hasn't amounted to a thing. I do not care\r\nif it is left to the executive committee if Mr. Latham will vouch for\r\nits being put through.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: Don't you remember as the result of that action we prepared\r\nforms to be used by those who examined the seedlings and decided what\r\nseedlings should be further tested and all that sort of thing. We have\r\nthose forms for use if the committee wants to use them.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: Those ought to be so as to hold the premium money back\r\nuntil we get some material to test.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: I will say a few words. It is not such a simple matter as it\r\nseems. Here come perhaps fifty people who have grown seedlings. We tell\r\nthem we are very desirous that all the seedlings in the state that have\r\npromise of merit be shown. In the division of the premium money they do\r\nnot get more than four or five dollars apiece, the best of them do not\r\nget more than eight or ten dollars. Then here comes a resolution which\r\nsays, \"Before you draw this money you have to furnish scions to the\r\nstate fruit-breeding farm with the privilege of sending out to other\r\nstations in the state for testing.\" The average man who owns a seedling\r\nthat is really a good thing begins to think about it, and we will not\r\nget what we want. If a man has a seedling that is better than the\r\nDuchess and Wealthy and has hardiness as well there are lots of buyers\r\naround here that have their eyes open. There has been a half a dozen I\r\nknow of picked up in the last few years really first class, fine and\r\nhardy. Those trees are being tested out. It would be a splendid thing if\r\nwe could get a really good seedling, as Mr. Andrews says, but a\r\nresolution of this kind will not result in doing what we want to do.\r\n\r\nI would like to have it referred to the executive board so they can work\r\nout a practical plan. Mr. Andrews is a member of the board. I renew my\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nMotion is seconded.\r\n\r\nThe President: The original motion as given by Mr. Andrews is that those\r\npeople offering seedlings for prizes, before they receive premiums--\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: The first or second premiums, I said, because that would\r\nshut out all of the others.\r\n\r\nThe President:--before receiving the first or second premiums, that they\r\nbe required or that they will agree to furnish scions or buds for\r\nexperimental purposes, these scions or buds to be sent to the central\r\nstation to Mr. Haralson for the purpose of testing them out as to\r\nhardiness, under number. Now, the amendment made by Mr. Latham is to the\r\neffect that this matter be referred to the executive committee. We will\r\nfirst put the amendment that it be referred to the executive committee\r\nto work out a practical plan.\r\n\r\nMr. Heustis: And report next year.\r\n\r\nThe President: That they work out a practical plan and put it in\r\noperation. Was it your idea that we report next year or that the plan be\r\nput in operation?\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: No objection to reporting next year. If they can work out a\r\nplan they can also put it in practical operation.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews: I do not think that I am after this now, gentlemen, any\r\nmore than every one of you ought to be after it. We ought to know more\r\nabout the hardiness of these trees. This list has stood almost\r\nidentically the same list for eight or nine years, pretty nearly the\r\nsame, and we are not getting ahead at all. We do not know any more about\r\nthe hardiness of these trees we have been putting out than we did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was carried.\r\n\r\nThe President: This matter will therefore be referred to the executive\r\nboard. The next in order is the annual report of the executive board,\r\nMr. J. M. Underwood, of Lake City, chairman. Mr. Underwood is sojourning\r\nin the sunny south. He has sent a report, however, to Secretary Latham,\r\nand Mr. Latham has requested me to read it. This was written at St.\r\nAugustine, Florida. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Any one wish to make any comments on this report? If not,\r\nwe will pass to the report of the secretary, Mr. Latham.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: Do you wish to have the report read or have it published\r\nlater? It will be published anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller: Let it be considered as read and approved and filed for\r\npublication. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMotion is seconded and carried.\r\n\r\nThe President: We will now have the report of George W. Strand,\r\ntreasurer. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: What will you do with the report of the treasurer? You\r\nhave heard the reading of it.\r\n\r\nUpon motion the report was adopted and filed.\r\n\r\nThe President: The next order of business would be the paper by\r\nProfessor J. C. Whitten but Mr. Whitten is not present, I am sorry to\r\nsay, and I am now going to call on Mr. O. M. Heustis as he is present to\r\ntell us about his \"Dwarf Apple Trees.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: We are very much indebted to the doctor for his\r\ninteresting talk. Is Professor Mackintosh in the room? I was going to\r\nask him to read a paper on \"Successful Cold Storage Plant for Apples,\"\r\nsent in by Mr. Hanson. I am sorry that Mr. Hanson is not able to be\r\npresent, he is ill at home.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mackintosh not being present, paper was read by Mr. Clarence\r\nWedge.\r\n\r\nThe President: Mr. Wedge will have a word for us at this time. He has a\r\nsuggestion to make.\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: Ladies and gentlemen, fellow members: Once a year our society\r\nhas been in the habit of bestowing the highest honor within its gift\r\nupon some of the members that have honored the society for so many years\r\nwith their services and have made themselves in that way so valuable to\r\nthe public that we feel that they deserve the highest recognition which\r\nwe are able to give them as a society. It becomes my great pleasure at\r\nthis time, standing in the place of my friend, Mr. Underwood, who is\r\nabsent, to propose the following names to you which have been\r\nrecommended by the executive board for this honor. There are five of\r\nthem, the names are: John Bisbee, of Madelia; Charles Haralson, our\r\nsuperintendent at Excelsior; Mr. F. W. Kimball, of Waltham; Mr. John R.\r\nCummins, of Minneapolis, and Mr. S. H. Drum, of Owatonna.\r\n\r\nMr. Bisbee has undertaken and is carrying on one of the largest\r\nexperiments in seedling apples in the Northwest. He seems to be a very\r\nquiet member among us, but he is one of the working members who are\r\ndoing the things that the society most needs.\r\n\r\nI do not need to tell you anything about the work of Charles Haralson,\r\nthe superintendent of our fruit-breeding farm at Zumbra Heights. His\r\nwork has approved itself to us all so much that I think he really\r\ndeserves the statement that was made by one of our older members that he\r\nhas outdone Burbank. He certainly has for this part of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. F. W. Kimball, a very dear personal friend of mine, has been\r\ncarrying on experiments in orcharding for the past twenty-five years\r\nabout, in the neighborhood of Austin, Minnesota, and has now removed to\r\nWaltham. His experiments there in top-working have been among the most\r\nuseful and among the largest that have been undertaken in any part of\r\nthe state. He perhaps deserve the same reputation in our state that our\r\nfriend, Mr. Philips, has in Wisconsin. I do not want to say this to\r\ndisparage anybody else, but he has certainly made a very large and very\r\nvaluable addition to our knowledge of the value of top-working.\r\n\r\nMr. John R. Cummins, of Minneapolis, whom we have with us this morning,\r\nis one who has been a very persistent experimenter in all lines. I\r\nremember particularly going to his place some ten or fifteen years ago\r\nand going over the remarkable collection of ornamental trees and plants\r\nthat he was growing, many of which I did not think it was possible to\r\ngrow at Albert Lea, and there he was succeeding with them and\r\ndeveloping them at a point 100 miles north of us. We certainly owe him\r\na deal of credit for his perseverance and his enterprise. We are glad\r\nthat he is with us today.\r\n\r\nMr. S. H. Drum, of Owatonna, is one who has also been one of our most\r\nfaithful members, whose experiments have been in fruits, and he has\r\nbrought great encouragement to us in the southern part of Minnesota. He\r\nhas now moved to Owatonna and, not being content with the best, he has\r\nstarted out with a new plantation with two kinds of fruit, and I think\r\nhe is topping the market with the very best.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I move that these names be added to the list of honorary\r\nlife members of the Minnesota Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nThere are several seconds to the motion.\r\n\r\nThe President: A very fitting tribute, I am sure. Are there any remarks?\r\nThe name of Mr. Cummins calls my attention to the fact that about twelve\r\nyears ago he presented this society with the gavel that I hold in my\r\nhand. This gavel is made of black walnut grown by Mr. Cummins on his own\r\nplace. I do not suppose that he made the gavel himself, but it is made\r\nof material raised on his own farm, and when this gavel comes down good\r\nand hard I want you to think of Mr. Cummins. Are you ready for the\r\nquestion, that those gentlemen suggested be made honorary life members?\r\n\r\nMotion is carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe President: I am now going to call on the young men from the\r\nUniversity Farm who are contestants for the Gideon Memorial Fund. (See\r\nindex.)\r\n\r\nContestants thereupon read their essays.\r\n\r\nThe President: I will now ask the judges to retire and decide which of\r\nthese young men is entitled to this prize money. For the benefit of some\r\nof the newer members who may not understand the situation I will say\r\nthat some years ago a number of the members of this society believed\r\nthat we should commemorate the good work done by Peter M. Gideon. A sum\r\nof money was raised to be known as the Gideon Memorial Fund. It was\r\ndecided that that money be placed at interest and that the interest\r\nderived therefrom be offered as prizes to young men attending our\r\nagricultural school or college. They were to deliver addresses at the\r\nmeetings of the Minnesota Horticultural Society, and the young men\r\npreparing the best papers and making the best talks would be awarded\r\nthis prize money, the accrued interest from this fund. So we have\r\nannually three young men from the agricultural college that present\r\npapers or make addresses on subjects that are of importance to this\r\nsociety. This is a memorial for Peter M. Gideon, who has done such\r\nsplendid work for the fruit raisers of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nWhile we are waiting for the report of the judges I will ask Mr. Ludlow\r\nto come forward and tell us about a letter that he received from Peter\r\nM. Gideon, November 2, 1885, and which was accompanied by Mr. Gideon's\r\nlast catalog.\r\n\r\nJudges announce their decision. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n_Premiums Awarded to Gideon Memorial Contestants_:\r\n\r\n1. The Plum Curculio--Edward A. Nelson.\r\n2. Standardizing the Potato--A. W. Aamodt.\r\n3. Marketing Fruit at Mankato--P. L. Keene.\r\n\r\nThe President: I am now going to call on some of the delegates to this\r\nmeeting. Mr. George H. Whiting, representing the South Dakota\r\nHorticultural Society, we will ask him to come forward and say a word.\r\n\r\nMr. Whiting: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I do not know why Mr.\r\nCashman should ask me to come forward. I have not very much to say and\r\ncould have said it back there just as well. Perhaps you will wish I had\r\nstayed back there.\r\n\r\nI will say it is a pleasure to me to be with the Minnesota\r\nhorticulturists again. I have met with you quite a number of years but\r\nnot in the capacity of delegate. I did not expect to be a delegate this\r\ntime, thought I would leave the place for some younger man, but there\r\nseemed to be no other present, and so I had to accept. I rather felt as\r\nthough I was not competent or did not care to take the responsibility of\r\nmaking a report. I am getting old and a little tired, and I do not like\r\nto do so much of that kind of work as I used to. However, I presume I\r\nwill have to do the best I can and let it go at that.\r\n\r\nI will say you have a wonderful society here. It is a wonder to me\r\nsometimes how you keep up the interest, how to keep up so much interest\r\nin this work. There is no other state in the Union that has such a good,\r\nlive society. I attended a great many of the state societies last year.\r\nI had the pleasure of attending the Missouri State Society. I can say\r\nthat you discount them and then some. An old state like Missouri and a\r\nfruit state, you might say, it is supposed to be in the fruit belt, and\r\nstill you fellows up north here have all the vim and the snap and\r\ndetermination to do things that those fellows do not do at all. It is\r\nmore in the man, I think sometimes, than it is in the location.\r\n\r\nIt used to be said that Minnesota was not a fruit state, you could not\r\ngrow apples in Minnesota. Well, I believe Mr. Gideon said that if he\r\ncould not grow apples in Minnesota he would not live there, something to\r\nthat effect, and he did not intend to leave the state either. Now, you\r\nall know what success he made, and you that follow have a great deal to\r\nbe thankful for the work he did, and you are hoping--and I presume you\r\nwill be successful--to obtain an apple that is even better than the\r\nWealthy.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you take so much interest in this matter of new\r\nseedlings. It will surely develop something some day, there is no\r\nquestion about it. Of course, you cannot tell when, and you cannot tell\r\nwho will be the lucky man to get the thousand dollars, but undoubtedly\r\nthere is more at stake than the thousand dollars; that is a very small\r\nitem.\r\n\r\nI think I will not take up your time. It is getting on, and I have not\r\nthought of making any talk, have nothing prepared and nothing in my\r\nhead. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I am going to call on our good friend, Professor Hansen,\r\nsecretary of the South Dakota Horticultural Society, who has done so\r\nmuch for us.\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: Mr. Hansen is not here. I just want to say a word that might\r\ninterest some of the younger members of the society in regard to our\r\nfriend who has just left the floor, Mr. Whiting, of Yankton. He is the\r\noriginal Dakota nurseryman, who went out in the days of the pioneers\r\nbefore I think there was any such thing as South Dakota, and he has\r\nstayed on the job ever since. That is not so wonderful, for others, lots\r\nof people, have stayed on the job, but he has made money out of the\r\nbusiness and got rich. I think he deserves some very special praise.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Is Professor Waldron in the room? Here he comes. He is\r\nthe leading light of North Dakota and a gentleman who has been with us\r\nbefore. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: These people will think North Dakota is a dark place if\r\nthis is a leading light. What is the occasion of this?\r\n\r\nThe President: Tell us your troubles.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: When we had a good wheat crop we did not have any troubles.\r\nWe forget our other troubles whenever we can get something like 100\r\nmillion bushels of wheat. Our horticultural troubles have been quite\r\nnumerous. We had a frost every year, including July. We started in on\r\nthe ninth day of June with a frost that killed everything in sight\r\nexcept a few cottonwood trees and things like that, but all of our\r\ntomatoes, which were in blossom by the way at that time because we had a\r\nfavorable spring, and plums and apples went the same way. I think a few\r\nof the late blooming plums managed to survive. The frost in July did not\r\nhurt very much but the frost in August certainly finished us.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: The reporter is taking all that.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: Our reputation is so good, we can own up to calamity once\r\nin a while. Of course, if our reputation was not better than others we\r\nwould have to keep it dark, but inasmuch as nature favors us so\r\ncontinuously we can own up when we get bumped. The August frost put our\r\ncorn out of business, so we are around with long fingers trying to steal\r\nseed corn.\r\n\r\nHowever, a great many of the people of the state are looking forward to\r\nthe matter of planting trees as never before, and our farmers and\r\ncitizens are taking more interest in general tree planting and\r\nbeautifying the homes than in previous years. I had this term a large\r\nclass of students in landscape gardening. They will go out to the places\r\nwhere they live and encourage the planting of trees and landscape\r\ngardening there. In this matter of general ornamentation the frosts or\r\nother calamities have not discouraged us. I think there were more trees\r\ngrown and more ornamental work done this year than in any two previous\r\nyears because the men have the money and are willing to spend it. I was\r\nout on a farm last week where a man insisted on buying a thousand\r\nevergreen trees. The nurseryman tried to sell him only five hundred, but\r\nhe would not have it that way. He wanted a thousand. He said he had the\r\nmoney and was going to pay for them; so he planted the thousand trees.\r\nWe do not recommend such rashness on the part of our farmers, but it\r\nshows when a farmer insists on having a thousand trees he is taking the\r\nbeautifying of his grounds seriously. This is perhaps an extreme case,\r\nbut we have others working along the same line.\r\n\r\nI certainly enjoy the privilege of being with you people here again as I\r\nhave for the last quarter of a century, twenty-five years ago, when I\r\nwas made an honorary member of this society, and I do not know of any\r\nprouder moment in my whole career than when you saw fit to honor me in\r\nthat manner. I certainly would never forgive myself for the balance of\r\nthe year if I failed to attend these meetings. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Waldron is too modest. He has not told the best thing he\r\never did in North Dakota, so I shall. I visited him a good many years\r\nago, and he had some interesting boys there, especially the oldest one,\r\nand I told him that if he was going to keep ahead of that boy he would\r\nhave to hustle, and now that boy at nineteen has the ability to go to\r\none of the southern states as a professor. So he didn't tell us the\r\ngreatest thing he ever did. Maybe some of the credit is due to his wife;\r\nthat is the way it is at my house. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Waldron: I am so far behind that boy I am sort of jealous. I do not\r\nmention it.\r\n\r\nThe President: The secretary of the Wisconsin Horticultural Society is\r\nwith us, Professor Cranefield. Is he in the room?\r\n\r\nMr. Cranefield: Mr. Graves, of Sturgeon Bay, is the duly accredited\r\ndelegate to the society and probably you want to hear from him.\r\n\r\nThe President: We heard from him two or three days ago, and we will hear\r\nfrom him again, but just now we want you to give us a few words. This is\r\nProfessor Cranefield, who has contributed on previous occasions to the\r\nsuccess of our meetings. (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I will now call on Professor Mackintosh, who is going to\r\nread a paper at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackintosh: Yesterday I had to start the ball rolling as a\r\nsubstitute for a man from Washington, and with the assistance of Miss\r\nBull we kept most of you here until after 12 o'clock. Today I am put\r\nahead of the program, so you won't hear me tomorrow afternoon. The\r\nsubject is, \"Bringing the Producer and Consumer Together.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mackintosh reads paper. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I regret very much that time will not permit us to\r\ndiscuss this very able paper. Secretary Latham has just called my\r\nattention to the fact that there has been but very few tickets bought\r\nfor the banquet this evening. You understand it takes time to prepare\r\nfood, and he has to announce just how many people would be present, and\r\nI sincerely hope that those of you who intend to attend the banquet (and\r\nI trust that will be every one present) will get your tickets\r\nimmediately. It is the very best part of our program. Please get your\r\ntickets so that Secretary Latham may know how to prepare for you.\r\n\r\nAt this time recess was taken until 1:30 o'clock p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 9, 1915, Afternoon Session.\r\n\r\nDiscussion on \"The Topworked Orchard,\" led by A. J. Philips, Wisconsin.\r\n(See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: The next order of business will be the election of\r\nofficers for the coming year. The secretary just handed me this slip\r\nwhich gives you an idea of the requirements in order to be eligible to\r\nvote for officers. (Reads extracts from constitution.) The first will be\r\nthe selection of a president for the coming year. Nominations are in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradley: Mr. President, it is said that republics are ungrateful,\r\nbut it is not necessary for horticultural societies to be ungrateful. It\r\nhas been, I think, in the past, and I hope it may continue to be in the\r\nfuture, the policy of this society to recognize the services of its\r\nofficers and so we, I think, are justified in recognizing the\r\ndistinguished and efficient services of our present presiding officer. I\r\ntake great pleasure in placing in nomination for president of this\r\nsociety the Honorable Thomas E. Cashman. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNomination is duly seconded and there are no other nominations.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: I move that the secretary be instructed to cast the\r\nunanimous ballot of this society for Thomas E. Cashman as president of\r\nthis society.\r\n\r\nMotion is seconded and carried.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashman: Friends, I deeply appreciate this honor that you have\r\nconferred upon me. I am always ready to contribute my mite towards the\r\nservice of the people, but I am never happy unless I am convinced that I\r\nam able to give all that the position demands. Your selection of me as\r\nyour presiding officer for the sixth time convinces me that you are at\r\nleast satisfied with what I have been able to do for you and this, I\r\nassure you, makes me extremely happy.\r\n\r\nI will endeavor to show my appreciation by doing all that is within my\r\npower to further the interests of this society made up of men and women\r\nthat cannot be excelled for intelligence, cleanliness of habits and\r\nhonorable and right living. I know a great many horticulturists, not\r\nonly of this state but of other states, and they, I assure you--and you\r\nknow it yourselves--are far above the average. I therefore deem it a\r\ngreat honor to be known as the president of one of the best\r\norganizations, I do not care whether it is horticultural or otherwise,\r\nin this country today. I thank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I find there are two members of the executive board to be\r\nelected at this time, one to succeed Professor LeRoy Cady and another\r\nMr. R. A. Wright, whose terms of office expire at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Cady and Mr. Wright are nominated to succeed themselves, nominations\r\nare seconded and upon motion the secretary cast the unanimous ballot of\r\nthe society for Mr. Cady and Mr. Wright as members of the executive\r\nboard for the coming three years.\r\n\r\nThe President: The next will be the selection of a treasurer.\r\n\r\nMr. George Strand is renominated, nomination is seconded and on motion\r\nthe secretary cast the ballot of the society for Mr. George W. Strand\r\nfor treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe President: The secretary places in nomination the following men, as\r\nvice presidents of this organization. I will ask him to name the list.\r\nVice-Presidents: C. E. Snyder, 1st Cong. Dist., Preston; S. D.\r\nRichardson, 2nd Cong. Dist., Winnebago; J. K. Andrews, 3rd Cong. Dist.,\r\nFaribault; B. Wallner, Jr., 4th Cong. Dist., St. Paul; F. H. Nutter, 5th\r\nCong. Dist., Minneapolis; Matt. Tschida, 6th Cong. Dist., St. Cloud; G.\r\nA. Anderson, 7th Cong. Dist., Renville; J. Kimball, 8th Cong. Dist.,\r\nDuluth; A. L. Hanson, 9th Cong. Dist., Ada; A. W. Richardson, 10th Cong.\r\nDist., Howard Lake.\r\n\r\nSecretary Latham reads names of nominees for vice presidents and places\r\nthem in nomination. Nomination is seconded and upon motion the secretary\r\nis instructed to cast the ballot of the society for the persons named as\r\nvice-presidents.\r\n\r\nThe President: The next number will be a speech by Mr. S. P. Crosby,\r\nchairman of the committee that was selected by this association to go\r\nbefore the legislature at the last session and try to secure an\r\nappropriation sufficient to build a home for this society. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe next gentleman on the program is our friend Clarence Wedge, who is\r\ngoing to tell us of his trip out to Yellowstone Park. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge: Not exactly to Yellowstone Park. We came within a day's drive\r\nof the Yellowstone, but our interest and enthusiasm went in another\r\ndirection this year.\r\n\r\nMr. Wedge reads paper.\r\n\r\nThe President: \"Peonies New and Old,\" by Mr. A. M. Brand, of Faribault,\r\none of the best peony specialists in the state.\r\n\r\nA Member: And of the world. (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: We have another noted horticulturist with us today from\r\nIllinois. You have all heard of the Senator Dunlap strawberry. The\r\noriginator is with us today, Senator Dunlap, of Savoy, Illinois. He will\r\nbe on the program tomorrow. I will be pleased to have the senator come\r\nforward and give us a word of greeting.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap: I hardly think it is necessary for me to come forward. I\r\nwill be on the program a couple of times, and you will hear all that you\r\ncare to from me. I am very glad to be here with you. It has been some\r\ntime since I met with your society, but I remember well the very\r\npleasant time I had at that time. I came this week from the Michigan\r\nHorticultural Society, in session at Grand Rapids, and I was very loath\r\nto leave such an interesting meeting, but I knew when I came to\r\nMinneapolis I would be in just as interesting a meeting. I wish to\r\ndisabuse your minds of the statements made by your honorable chairman\r\nthrough an error. I am not the originator of the Senator Dunlap\r\nstrawberry. The Reverend Mr. Reisenour (?) is the originator of the\r\nstrawberry, and he thought it was a thrifty, strong, healthy plant and\r\nwould stand the name of Dunlap, so he gave it to the strawberry.\r\n(Laughter and Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I stand corrected. I have been misinformed, although I\r\nthink you carry the honor. Our time is up. I have been requested to\r\nannounce that the lantern talk given by Mrs. James Jennison will take\r\nplace at the close of the Woman's Auxiliary meeting. Some very talented\r\nladies are to speak this afternoon, and I hope you will all stay and\r\nlisten to them. I will now turn the meeting over to the Women's\r\nAuxiliary and request Mrs. F. M. Powers, who will preside, to take the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Powers: Just a continuation, I hope, of our good program that was\r\nbegun this afternoon, and we will now listen to Mrs. Clarence Wedge, of\r\nAlbert Lea, on the \"Value of Horticulture to the Farm.\" Mrs. Wedge is\r\nnot a stranger to horticulture nor to this society. (See index.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Powers: Some one has said that the enemy of art is the enemy of\r\nnature, and art is nothing more than the highest sagacity and attainment\r\nof human nature. We have with us Mrs. Cyrus W. Wells, who has had\r\nconsiderable experience in this line and will give us the practical\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wells spoke on \"Art Made Practical.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Powers: \"The Day's Work,\" by Mrs. John B. Irwin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Powers: According to our program we were to have one speaker\r\ntomorrow morning because we thought she could not be here at this time,\r\nbut Mrs. Dunlap is here and will favor us now, if you please.\r\n\r\nTalk by Mrs. A. M. Dunlap on \"Better Methods in the Home.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Powers: The last number on our program will be \"The Highway\r\nBeautiful,\" by Mrs. Jennison.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jennison gave a lantern talk.\r\n\r\nPresident Cashman: We have a very important question to be considered\r\nthis afternoon, and, fortunately for us, it is going to be taken care of\r\nby one of our best men--\"Breeding for Hardiness\"--something this\r\ngentleman has been doing all his life. He has met with a great deal of\r\nsuccess, and we are profiting by it. That gentleman is Professor N. E.\r\nHansen, of Brookings, South Dakota. (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Mr. C. E. Older has some suggestions to make, and we will\r\ngive him an opportunity to talk at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Older: Mr. President, and Ladies and Gentlemen: In a meeting of some\r\nof the leading exhibitors of the state fair yesterday they expressed\r\nquite a bit of dissatisfaction with the present manner of awarding\r\npremiums on commercial apples, that is, boxes of apples and one-layer\r\nboxes. The point was that it would be a good thing if the state could be\r\ndivided so that the sections which are more favorable for the\r\ndevelopment of the apple would be in a section by themselves, and the\r\nbalance of the state compete by itself. The following resolution was\r\nformulated to bring before this society, asking for their opinion oh the\r\nsubject and discussion:\r\n\r\nResolved, That we ask the state fair board that the state be divided\r\ninto two sections for the purpose of exhibit at the State Fair, making\r\ntwo classes, one being the Wealthy apple and the other class comprising\r\nall other varieties of box and one layer apples, the state to be divided\r\nas follows: Beginning at the Mississippi river on the north line of\r\nGoodhue County and running west on the north line of Goodhue, Rice, Le\r\nSueur and Nicollet Counties, thence running south on the west line of\r\nNicollet, Blue Earth and Faribault. All those counties lying east and\r\nsouth of these lines are to constitute the first district, the balance\r\nof the state being known as the second district.\r\n\r\nWe also ask the state fair board that first, second, third, fourth and\r\nfifth premiums be offered on all apples, and on all the next ten lower\r\nexhibits a certain premium be paid to all deserving exhibits.\r\n\r\nAnd we ask that premiums be offered on Everbearing Strawberries showing\r\nboth bearing plants and fruit of the Progressive, Superb, and any other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nWe also ask the state fair board that they make some practical\r\narrangements to get the horticultural exhibits moved to the state fair\r\nfrom the depots in a more satisfactory and cheaper manner than the\r\npresent arrangements.\r\n\r\nI move you that this resolution be adopted.\r\n\r\nMotion was seconded and carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nMeeting adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 10, 1915, Morning Session.\r\n\r\nThe President: We are to have a talk on \"Spraying the Orchard,\" by\r\nSenator Dunlap, of Illinois, this morning. (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: We thank Senator Dunlap for his able talk. I think that is\r\nthe way to progress. If we do not do things right up-to-date we can\r\nlearn how to do better from a competent man.\r\n\r\nThe President: We all enjoyed the able talk of Senator Dunlap. He is\r\npresident of the Orchard Association of Illinois. He is considered one\r\nof the most practical men down there, and we are very fortunate in\r\nhaving him with us and to listen to his valuable talk and experience.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe will now listen to Professor Richard Wellington, who will tell us\r\nabout \"Orcharding in Minnesota.\" (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: I am going to suggest a little matter at this time which\r\nI am sure you will all approve of. It has been said by hundreds of men\r\nand women attending these meetings who have had an opportunity of\r\nenjoying the talks and papers and splendid program given here that we\r\nhad the greatest horticultural society in the world. It is true that we\r\nhave the largest membership of any horticultural society in the United\r\nStates and, I presume, of the world.\r\n\r\nYou will all agree with me that is due to the efforts of one man to a\r\nlarge extent. That man has been in our service and looked after our\r\ninterests for twenty-five years. He is at his best all the time,\r\ncordial, kind, using good judgment, prevents friction among us, always\r\nworking for the best interests of everybody belonging to the society and\r\nthe interests of the state.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, he has served us twenty-five years, and I think it\r\nonly fitting at this time that we should show our appreciation in a way\r\nthat will appeal better than words. It has been suggested that we\r\npurchase some little token and present it this afternoon. It is up to\r\nyou as to how much you want to give or whether you want to give anything\r\nor not, but Mr. Crosby and Mr. Brackett will be at the door as you pass\r\nout this noon, and they will probably have a hat there and you can drop\r\nin what you want to, and we will buy something for him and present it\r\nthis afternoon. (Great applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Now we will turn the meeting over to the Plant Breeders'\r\nAuxiliary. I regret very much to have to announce that our good friend,\r\nClarence Wedge, president of this auxiliary, is ill this afternoon and\r\nunable to occupy the chair. I understand there is no vice-president of\r\nthe auxiliary, and I have been requested to continue as chairman during\r\nthis meeting.\r\n\r\nWe have a very important program, one of the very best we have had. Some\r\nof our best men are on this program and I hope you will all stay and\r\nattend the balance of this meeting. I am going to call on our good\r\nfriend, Charles Haralson, superintendent of the Zumbra Heights farm, to\r\ntell us about \"New Fruits Originated at the State Fruit-Breeding Farm.\"\r\n(Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Professor C. B. Waldron, of North Dakota, finds it\r\nnecessary to leave in a very short time, and he will therefore address\r\nyou at this time instead of this afternoon. He will tell us about\r\n\"Running Out of Varieties.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nWe will now listen to the report of the committee on examination of the\r\nMinnesota State Fruit-Breeding Farm, Dr. O. M. Huestis, Chairman. (See\r\nindex.)\r\n\r\nThe President: The next speaker needs no introduction to a Minnesota\r\naudience, as the word \"Hansen\" is a household word and particularly in\r\nevery agricultural community within the state, and the Hansen hybrids\r\nare eagerly sought for by practically everybody who plants trees.\r\nProfessor Hansen has done a good work and is still accomplishing things.\r\nHe will tell us what he has done during 1915. I regret the time is so\r\nshort, but we will get Mr. Hansen to tell us more about his work.\r\n\r\n\"Newer Fruits,\" Prof. N. E. Hansen, Brookings, S. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session, at 1:30.\r\n\r\nHalf-hour exercise, questions and answers on \"Increasing the Fertility\r\nof the Land,\" led by Dr. F. J. Alway. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Mr. Crosby has a word for us, and before continuing with\r\nthe regular program I will ask him to come forward at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby: Gentlemen of the Horticultural Society: Mr. Latham, please\r\ncome this way. I have the honor, in behalf of the society, to inform\r\nyou, as you probably know, that this is your silver wedding, but we are\r\ngoing it one better and make it a golden wedding for you today. We have\r\ncome to the conclusion, you have been with this society for twenty-five\r\nyears, and we think it is best that you be watched and chained. I have\r\nthe honor of presenting to you, in behalf of the society, a gold watch\r\nand chain. That is all I have to say. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Philips: Now for a speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham: Wait a moment, I will see if it is worth it. (Laughter.) I\r\nhate to part with this old turnip. I have carried it forty-five years\r\nnow, never broke a crystal on it, even. It is a good faithful companion.\r\nI do not know what I will do with this now unless I put it away in a\r\nsafety vault somewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not think the Horticultural Society expects me to make a speech;\r\nthey know I am not a talker. I could say something if the room were\r\nsmaller, but my voice does not seem to carry very well. I am a good deal\r\nin the fix of the steamboat that carried passengers on the river up and\r\ndown to the camp meeting there. They had a whistle on that boat that\r\nmade a tremendous noise but when they blew it the boat had to stop.\r\n(Laughter.) If I talk loud enough to be heard here, my thinking works do\r\nnot operate. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nI hardly know how to express my appreciation of this gift, as showing\r\nthe sentiment of the society towards me. Of course, I have tried to do\r\nwhat I could for the society. Sometimes, perhaps, I have gone a little\r\ntoo far, something like the man who was appointed in charge of a flag\r\nstation. He had never done any such service as that, but he understood\r\nthe business of a flagman was to stop trains. The first train that came\r\nalong was a heavy express train, eight or ten or a dozen coaches, and he\r\nrushed out and flagged the train. The conductor got off, all in a hurry,\r\nand looked around. He did not see anybody but the flagman. He said:\r\n\"Where are your passengers?\" \"Well,\" he says, \"there ain't any\r\npassengers to get on, but I didn't know but somebody would like to get\r\noff.\" (Laughter.) Sometimes, perhaps, I have overreached myself here.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years is quite a while to look back, and as I look over the\r\nfaces of those present I can scarcely see one that was a member of the\r\nsociety twenty-five years ago when I became secretary. Mr. Long in his\r\naddress before you at the banquet last night spoke of the meeting that\r\nhe first attended of the horticultural society, held in what is now the\r\nMetropolitan Life, on the ground floor, and he spoke of the surroundings\r\nthere. No fruit on exhibition. If a man had two or three apples in his\r\npocket, he showed them around on the sly as though it was a crime to let\r\npeople know there was such a thing and that he had a few at home he\r\ncould eat. Quite a remarkable thing!\r\n\r\nThat was the meeting of the horticultural society in which I was first\r\nelected secretary, and I recall well all the circumstances connected\r\nwith it. So many of our members that I thought so much of in those days\r\nare gone. Of those who were present at that meeting, the only person\r\nleft that I recall is Mr. Underwood. I had forgotten Mr. Long was there;\r\nI think he reported the meeting; I guess the first of our meetings that\r\nhe reported, too.\r\n\r\nI am not going to make any more of an address. President Vincent is here\r\nand will address you. I thank you very much indeed. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent: I am very glad that I got in in time to be a witness to\r\nthis delightful and gratifying little ceremony which has just taken\r\nplace. I can not imagine anything more satisfying to a man who, in spite\r\nof all his modesty, knows he has done for twenty-five years good,\r\ngenuine, valuable work than to have other people intimate in so pleasant\r\na way that they are not entirely oblivious to what he has done.\r\n\r\nIt always does one good to see efficient work recognized, and, while I\r\ncannot own, I am sorry to say, to an intimate personal acquaintance with\r\nMr. Latham, I have come into association with him often enough to be\r\nable to share a little what you feel toward him and toward what he has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe President: I am sure you will all be delighted to hear from the very\r\npopular president of one of the greatest universities in the United\r\nStates, President George E. Vincent of Minnesota State University, who\r\nwill now address you. (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I am sure we are very much indebted to President Vincent\r\nfor this most scholarly and delightful speech. We hope he can continue\r\nwith us during the afternoon. Owing to the fullness of our program this\r\nforenoon we are unable to discuss one of our most important subjects,\r\nand that was \"The Elements of Hardiness,\" by Prof. M. J. Dorsey, member\r\nof the Fruit Breeding Section, of the University Farm. He will discuss\r\nthat question at this time. (Applause.) (See index.)\r\n\r\nThe President: Senator Dunlap, who so delightfully entertained us this\r\nmorning and instructed us on the subject of \"Spraying\" will now speak to\r\nus on the subject of \"Packing and Marketing Apples.\" (See index.)\r\n\r\nDiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe President: I am now going to call on a gentleman that hasn't said a\r\nword during our discussions and that is Mr. Weld, and request him to\r\nrecite his favorite poem.\r\n\r\nMr. Weld recites \"The Three Warnings.\"\r\n\r\nThe President: We have had a very interesting session, had a good time,\r\neverything has gone very nicely, but somehow there has been one thing\r\nlacking. The old friends from Iowa have not been with us with one\r\nexception, Mr. Ferris, who gave us the lantern talk on Tuesday, but\r\nFriend Gardner, Patten, Sherman and several others (I believe Sherman\r\nhas been in town, but we have not seen him here) have been absent. The\r\nreason for it is that the Iowa people have been holding their annual\r\nmeeting. But I am very glad that Mr. Gardner is with us this afternoon,\r\nand I am now going to call upon Mr. Charles F. Gardner, of Osage, Iowa.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I have attended your\r\nmeetings so long that when I appear here before you I feel as though I\r\nhad got home. I have attended every meeting of this society except two\r\nsince this society held its annual meeting at Lake City the last time.\r\nThat is when I joined the society, and since that time a great many\r\nthings have taken place. Think it is seventeen or eighteen years ago, in\r\nthat neighborhood. I was absent two years. I went to New Mexico, I went\r\nthere to die, but luckily I escaped and came back home. I want to say\r\nthis, that when I got back to this part of the country, if there was\r\nanything I thanked God for it was that I was spared to get back. I think\r\nthere is no necessity of emigrating either from Minnesota or Iowa, and\r\npeople that have traveled over the west and made a tour extending along\r\nthe Pacific coast and finally get back into this country, this latitude,\r\nare generally pretty well satisfied and stay here. That is, providing\r\nthey didn't spend all their money and can not get back here. Some of our\r\ncitizens are now stranded out there and will come home whenever they\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the progress of horticulture in this length of time, I know\r\nyou are very much interested in the work of Mr. Patten and a good many\r\nof you have trees that he originated. I want to say that the people of\r\nour state of Iowa have not really gotten their eyes open yet in\r\nhorticultural ways. They only appropriated for our use $4,000. We have\r\nfive societies, the state society--and then the state is divided into\r\nfour sections. In the last few years our state society has appropriated\r\nto carry on, to help Mr. Patten carry on his work, we have appropriated\r\nand used $4,600.\r\n\r\nBefore that time our society allowed $50.00 a year for station fees for\r\nquite a little while, then before that $25.00 a year. Last year we\r\nappeared before the legislature and tried to get some help to keep up\r\nthat work and informed them that our money was getting short and that\r\nunless it was done we could not carry on that work. The legislature\r\nhardly winked an eye at our request. No money was appropriated, and of\r\nall the things that I ever hated to help do last week was to discontinue\r\nthe Charles City station. For fear that some one might think we had gone\r\nback on Mr. Patten and that the work he has done will be lost to the\r\nworld, I will say there is nothing of that kind. There is not a member\r\nof our society but would do anything in the world for Mr. Patten, to\r\nhelp him. It is just simply a fact that the money of our society is so\r\nnearly exhausted we had hardly enough to pay for the expenses of our\r\nmeeting last week. We had a splendid meeting and never had such an\r\nexhibit of apples before. Perhaps we may have had as many apples on\r\nexhibit but not so many perfect ones. On the first opportunity we have\r\nwe are going to see that Mr. Patten does not suffer. I would say that\r\nthey are in pretty good shape to take care of Mr. Patten down there for\r\na year or two, and we will not lose the valuable work he has done.\r\n\r\nAs the meeting is drawing to a close I want to say in closing that if\r\nthere is anything that does me good it is to come up here and look into\r\nyour faces once a year, and I wish that I could see more of you. There\r\nis a kind of bond of brotherhood and a feeling that when I am here I am\r\namong friends and I have found that to be the case for almost twenty\r\nyears. Thank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe President: I have just discovered a question here that should be\r\nanswered, if there is anyone here that can do so. \"In my locality the\r\nbasswood and box elders are infested with a scale-like substance that\r\nlooks like cotton. Most of the trees of the varieties named are\r\ninfested. What is it and is there a remedy?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: That is no doubt the cottonwood bug that infects the soft\r\nmaple. They come and work for about three years and then some insect\r\ncomes in and cleans them out.\r\n\r\nThe President: What is the remedy, Mr. Kellogg?\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg: You can use any spray for this bug. On forest trees it is\r\nout of reach, but arsenical spray will get them if you can reach them.\r\n\r\nMr. Warner: Cotton maple scale. Professor Waldron recommends to spray\r\nwith crude oil when the trees are dormant. We find it best to cut it\r\nback. The cottony appearance does not show until the second year and\r\nthen the scale has really done its injury. The time to cut it, you will\r\nfind a lot of small scales on the young twigs, and if they are cut off\r\nand a new growth forced you get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe President: I understand Prof. Broderick of the College of Winnipeg\r\nhas been here. If he is here I wish he would come forward and give us a\r\nword. I understand he is the delegate from Winnipeg. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Broderick: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: Before going away, I\r\nwould like, as a member of the Manitoba society to express to you my\r\ngreat pleasure at being here and taking part in your excellent meeting.\r\nI had planned for a number of years to come down but circumstances have\r\nbeen such that I have been unable to be here. I might say that we in\r\nManitoba, about 400 miles north of here, are interested in horticulture\r\nas well as you people in Minnesota. We have a fraternal interest in the\r\nwork you are doing. A number of our members, I might say, are members of\r\nyour society, and we are getting your excellent publication and\r\nfollowing the work you are doing. Our problems up there are very similar\r\nto yours, and we feel that you can give us greater information than we\r\ncan obtain from any other source. We appreciate the excellent work you\r\nare doing, and it has been of great interest to me to see the wide range\r\nof subjects you are covering. I was particularly interested this morning\r\nin the session of the plant breeders, as that is a line of work that we\r\nfeel up in Manitoba has some possibilities for us. In a horticultural\r\nline we are confined very largely to the hardy varieties. We are working\r\non improving the hardiness of our varieties, and the fruit growing as it\r\nis carried on with us very largely in a small way by the farmers and\r\nothers interested through our province. We feel, however, that there are\r\npossibilities, and we are only too glad to get any information from you\r\nas to the work and progress that is being made in the matter of hardy\r\nfruits. We have been endeavoring to improve our native plums. I have had\r\nthe station there at Winnipeg, and in connection with one of our\r\nnurserymen, Mr. Buchanan, we have been selecting hardy plums for a\r\nnumber of years, and we hope from that stock in crossing with the\r\nJapanese plums, as Professor Hansen suggested this morning, to prove\r\nthat there are possibilities even as far north as Manitoba. I have heard\r\nMr. Buchanan say on several occasions that he thought the possibilities\r\nof plum growing were fairly good in Manitoba. In small fruits we have\r\npossibilities. The currants and raspberries grow very well. We have not\r\ndone so much in strawberries, but I know there are a number of growers\r\nin parts of the province that are making some very successful\r\nexperiments in strawberries, and we hope in a few years to produce\r\nstrawberries of a fairly good quality.\r\n\r\nThe President: How is your wild strawberry?\r\n\r\nMr. Broderick: I find that the wild strawberry does very well. We have\r\naround Winnipeg, where the college is located, a wild strawberry that\r\ndoes very well, and it is possible that we can do some work on improving\r\nthe wild strawberry. We are looking to our hardy native fruits and the\r\nhardy importations we are making to establish varieties which are hardy\r\nand suited to our conditions. We are interested also in the work done in\r\ntree planting, and I followed with interest the discussion this morning\r\nas to windbreak protection. That has been a problem with us. The\r\ngovernment of the Dominion has taken it over, and we find it is working\r\nout all right. Our Forestry Station at Indian Head sends out lots of\r\ntrees free each year. These are planted, and they have a system of\r\ninspection. Certain requirements are made in regard to the preparation\r\nof the soil, methods of planting and caring for the plantation\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nA Member: What are the majority of your forest trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Broderick: Forest trees are largely deciduous, the Manitoba maple,\r\nthe ash, the elm and the willows. I was pleased to hear some one this\r\nmorning mention the golden willow. That is one of the best trees we\r\nhave. The Manitoba maple, of course grows all over that northern\r\ncountry, but we find that during recent years it has been becoming\r\nseriously infected with various kinds of pests. This year the aphis were\r\nserious. We are discouraging to a certain extent the Manitoba maple and\r\nplanting other trees and are getting better results. The ash, the elm\r\nand willow are doing well. With the conifer trees, the Scotch pine, the\r\nwhite spruce, the balsam fir and the ridgepole pine are those which are\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nThe improving of home grounds is another question that is interesting\r\nus. I do not think there is anything in this western country that is\r\ngoing to do more to make homes than this. So we are interested in all\r\nthe work you are carrying on, and we appreciate the opportunity of\r\ncoming here and meeting with you and listening to the excellent\r\ndiscussions you have. I might say that our annual meeting is held in\r\nFebruary and if any of you happen to stray up there we would be only too\r\nglad to have you join with us.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for the many courtesies extended to me on behalf\r\nof the Manitoba society. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n(Time was now taken up by two minute speeches of different members,\r\nafter which the meeting was declared closed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of Executive Board for 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord of meeting held in secretary's office 8:00 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 6,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\nThere were present Thos.
