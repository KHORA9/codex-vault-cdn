For the student’s use the more difficult\r\nportions, particularly that on the embryology, may be omitted. The work\r\nhas grown in part out of the writer’s experience in class work.\r\n\r\nIn instructing small classes in the anatomy and metamorphoses of\r\ninsects, it was strongly felt that the mere dissection and drawing of a\r\nfew types, comprising some of our common insects, were by no means\r\nsufficient for broad, thorough work. Plainly enough the laboratory work\r\nis all important, being rigidly disciplinary in its methods, and\r\naffording the foundation for any farther work. But to this should be\r\nadded frequent explanations or formal lectures, and the student should\r\nbe required to do collateral reading in some general work on structural\r\nand developmental entomology. With this aim in view, the present work\r\nhas been prepared.\r\n\r\nIt might be said in explanation of the plan of this book, that the\r\nstudents having previously taken a lecture course in the zoölogy of the\r\ninvertebrates, were first instructed in the facts and conclusions\r\nbearing on the relations of insects to other Arthropoda, and more\r\nespecially the anatomy of Peripatus, of the Myriopoda, and of\r\nScolopendrella. Then the structure of Campodea, Machilis, and Lepisma\r\nwas described, after which a few types of winged insects, beginning with\r\nthe locust and ending with the bee, were drawn and dissected; the nymph\r\nof the locust, and the larva and pupa of a moth and of a wasp and bee\r\nbeing drawn and examined. Had time permitted, an outline of the\r\nembryology and of the internal changes in flies during their\r\nmetamorphoses would have been added.\r\n\r\nThis book gives, of course with much greater fulness and detail for\r\nreference and collateral reading, what we roughly outlined in our class\r\nwork. The aim has been to afford a broad foundation for future more\r\nspecial work by any one who may want to carry on the study of some group\r\nof insects, or to extend in any special direction our present knowledge\r\nof insect morphology and growth.\r\n\r\nMany of our entomologists begin their studies without any previous\r\nknowledge of the structure of animals, taking it up as an amusement.\r\nThey may be mere collectors and satisfied simply to know the name of\r\ntheir captures, but it is hoped that with this book in their hands they\r\nmay be led to desire farther information regarding what has already been\r\ndone on the structure and mode of growth of the common insects. For\r\npractical details as to how to dissect, to make microscopic slides, and\r\nto mount and preserve insects generally, they are referred to the\r\nauthor’s “Entomology for Beginners.”\r\n\r\nIt may also be acknowledged that even in our best and latest general\r\ntreatises on zoölogy, or comparative anatomy, or morphology, the portion\r\nrelated to insects is scarcely so thoroughly done as those parts devoted\r\nto other phyla, that of Lang, however, his invaluable Comparative\r\nAnatomy, being an exception. On this account, therefore, it is hoped\r\nthat this hiatus in our literature may be in a degree filled.\r\n\r\nThe author has made free use of the excellent article “Insecta” of\r\nNewport, of Lang’s comprehensive summary in his most useful Text-book of\r\nComparative Anatomy, of Graber’s excellent Die Insecten, of Miall and\r\nDenny’s The Structure and Life-History of the Cockroach, and of Sharp’s\r\nInsecta. Kolbe’s Einführung has been most helpful. But besides these\r\nhelps, liberal use has been made of the very numerous memoirs and\r\nmonographic articles which adorn our entomological literature. The\r\naccount of the embryology of insects is based on Korschelt and Heider’s\r\nelaborate work, Lehrbuch der Vergleichenden Entwicklungsgeschichte der\r\nWirbellosen Thiere, the illustrations of this portion being mainly taken\r\nfrom it, through the Messrs. Swan Sonnenschein & Co., London.\r\n\r\nProfessor H. S. Pratt has kindly read over the manuscript and also the\r\nproofs of the portion on embryology and metamorphoses, and the author is\r\nhappy to acknowledge the essential service he has rendered.\r\n\r\nThe bibliographical lists are arranged by dates, so as to give an idea\r\nof the historical development of each subject. The aim has been to make\r\nthese lists tolerably complete and to include the earliest, almost\r\nforgotten works and articles as well as the most recent.\r\n\r\nMuch care has been taken to give due credit either to the original\r\nsources from which the illustrations are copied, or to the artist; about\r\nninety of the simpler figures were drawn by the author, many of them for\r\nthis work. For the use of certain figures acknowledgments are due to the\r\nBoston Society of Natural History, to the Division of Entomology, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, through the kind offices of Mr. L. O. Howard,\r\nand to the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History, through\r\nProfessor S. A. Forbes and Mr. C. A. Hart. Professor W. M. Wheeler, of\r\nthe University of Chicago, has kindly loaned for reproduction several of\r\nhis original drawings published in the Journal of Morphology. A number\r\nare reproduced from figures in the reports of the United States\r\nEntomological Commission.\r\n\r\n  PROVIDENCE, R.

There are about\r\n250,000 species already named and contained in our museums, while the\r\nnumber of living and fossil species in all is estimated to amount to\r\nbetween one and two millions.\r\n\r\nIn their structure insects are perhaps more complicated than any other\r\nanimals. This is partly due to the serial arrangement of the segments\r\nand the consequent segmental repetition of organs, especially of the\r\nexternal appendages, and of the muscles, the tracheæ, and the nerves.\r\nThe brain is nearly or quite as complicated as that of the higher\r\nvertebrates, while the sense-organs, especially those of touch, sight,\r\nand smell are, as a rule, far more numerous and only less complex than\r\nthose of vertebrates. Moreover, in their psychical development, certain\r\ninsects are equal, or even superior, to any other animals, except birds\r\nand mammals.\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom is primarily divided into two grand divisions, the\r\none-celled (_Protozoa_) and many-celled animals (_Metazoa_). In the\r\nlatter group the cells and tissues forming the body are arranged in\r\nthree fundamental cell-layers; viz. the _ectoderm_ or outer layer, the\r\n_mesoderm_, and _endoderm_. The series of branches, or phyla, comprised\r\nunder the term Metazoa are the Porifera, Cœlenterata, Vermes,\r\nEchinodermata, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata.

It is with little doubt that to their power of flight, and thus of\r\nescaping the attacks of their creeping arthropod enemies, insects owe,\r\nso to speak, their success in life; _i.e._ their numerical superiority\r\nin individuals, species, and genera. It is also apparently their power\r\nof moving or swimming swiftly from one place to another which has led to\r\nthe numerical superiority in species of fishes to other Vertebrata.\r\nAmong terrestrial vertebrates, the birds, by virtue of their ability to\r\nfly, greatly surpass in number of species the reptiles and mammals.\r\n\r\nThe Arthropoda are in general characterized by having the body composed\r\nof segments (somites or arthromeres) bearing jointed appendages. They\r\ndiffer from the worms in having segmented appendages, _i.e._ antennæ,\r\njaws, and legs, instead of the soft unjointed outgrowths of the annelid\r\nworms. Moreover, their bodies are composed of a more or less definite\r\nnumber of segments or rings, grouped either into a head-thorax\r\n(cephalothorax) and hind-body, as in Crustacea, or into a head\r\ndifferentiated from the rest of the body (trunk), the latter not being\r\ndivided into a distinct thorax and abdomen, as in Myriopoda; or into\r\nthree usually quite distinct regions—the head, thorax, and hind-body or\r\nabdomen, as in insects. In certain aberrant, modified forms, as the\r\nTardigrada, or the Pantopoda, and the mites, the body is not\r\ndifferentiated into such definite regions.\r\n\r\nIn their internal organs arthropods agree in their general relations\r\nwith the higher worms, hence most zoölogists agree that they have\r\ndirectly originated from the annelid worms.\r\n\r\nThe position and general shape of the digestive canal, of the nervous\r\nand circulatory systems, are the same in Arthropoda as in annelid\r\n(oligochete) worms, so much so that it is generally thought that the\r\nArthropoda are the direct descendants of the worms. It is becoming\r\nevident, however, that there was no common ancestor of the Arthropoda as\r\na whole, and that the group is a polyphyletic one. Hence, though a\r\nconvenient group, it is a somewhat artificial one, and may eventually be\r\ndismembered into at least three or four phyla or branches.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram may serve to show in a tentative way the relations\r\nof the classes of Arthropoda to each other, and also may be regarded as\r\na provisional genealogical tree of the branch.\r\n\r\n                                    9. _Insecta._\r\n                                          |                  7. _Chilopoda._\r\n                          4. _Arachnida._ |                           |\r\n                                 |        | 6. _Diplopoda._           |\r\n                                 |        |        |                  |\r\n         3. _Merostomata._       |  8. _Symphyla._ |                  |\r\n                 |               |        |        |                  |\r\n 1. _Crustacea._ |               |        |        |6_a_. _Pauropoda._|\r\n        |        |2. _Trilobita._|        |        |       |          |\r\n        |        |       |       |        |        +-------+          |\r\n        |        |       |       |        |        |                  |\r\n        |        +-------+-------+        +--------+------------------+\r\n        |                |                |\r\n        |                |                +--------+\r\n        |                |                         |\r\n        |                |                  5. _Peripatus._\r\n        |                |4_a_. _Pantopoda._         |\r\n        |                |       |                   |\r\n        |                |       |4_b_. _Tardigrada._|\r\n        |                |       |        |          |\r\n        +----------------+-------+--------+----------+\r\n                         |\r\n               _Different Annelida._\r\n                   Trochosphæra.\r\n\r\nWe will now rapidly review the leading features of the classes of\r\nArthropoda.\r\n\r\n=The Crustacea.=—These Arthropoda are in many most important\r\ncharacteristics unlike the insects; they have two pairs of antennæ, five\r\npairs of buccal appendages, and they are branchiate Arthropoda. They\r\nhave evidently originated entirely independently, and by a direct line\r\nof descent from some unknown annelid ancestor which was either a\r\nmany-segmented worm, with parapodia, or the two groups together with the\r\nRotifera may have originated from a common appendigerous Trochosphæra.\r\nTheir segments in the higher forms are definite in number (23 or 24) and\r\narranged into two regions, a head-thorax (cephalothorax) and hind-body\r\n(abdomen). Nearly all the segments, both of the cephalothorax and\r\nabdomen, bear a pair of jointed limbs, and to them at their base are, in\r\nthe higher forms, appended the gills (branchiæ). The limbs are in the\r\nmore specialized forms (shrimps and crabs) differentiated into\r\neye-stalks, two pairs of antennæ, a pair of palpus-bearing jaws\r\n(mandibles), two pairs of maxillæ and three pairs of maxillipeds; these\r\nappendages being biramose, and the latter bearing gills attached to\r\ntheir basal joints. The legs are further differentiated into ambulatory\r\nthoracic legs and into swimming or abdominal legs, and in the latter the\r\nfirst pair of the male is modified into copulatory organs (gonopoda).\r\nThe male and female reproductive organs as a rule are in separate\r\nindividuals, hermaphrodites being very unusual, and the glands may be\r\npaired or single. The sexual outlets are generally paired, and, as in\r\nthe male lobster and other Macrura, open in the basal joint of the last\r\npair of legs, and in the female in the third from the last; while\r\noriginally in all Crustacea the sexual organs were most probably paired\r\n(Fig. 3, _B_).\r\n\r\nThey are, except a few land Isopoda, aquatic, mostly marine, and when\r\nthey have a metamorphosis, pass through a six-legged larval stage,\r\ncalled the Nauplius, the shrimps and crabs passing through an additional\r\nstage, the Zoëa. Crustacea also differ much from insects in the highly\r\nmodified nature of the nephridia, which are usually represented by the\r\ngreen gland of the lobster, or the shell-glands of the Phyllopoda, which\r\nopen out in one of the head-segments; also in the possession of a pair\r\nof large digestive glands, the so-called liver.\r\n\r\nIntermediate in some respects between the Crustacea and insects, but\r\nmore primitive, in respect to what are perhaps the most weighty\r\ncharacters, than the Crustacea, are the Trilobita, the Merostomata\r\n(Limulus), and, finally, the Arachnida, these being allied groups. In\r\nthe Trilobita and Merostomata (Limulus), the head-appendages are more\r\nlike feet than jaws, while they have in most respects a similar mode of\r\nembryonic development, the larval forms being also similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—Restoration of under side of a trilobite (_Triarthrus becki_),\r\n    the trunk limbs bearing small triangular respiratory lobes or\r\n    gills.—After Beecher.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The Merostomata.=—The only living form, Limulus, is undoubtedly a very\r\nprimitive type, as the genital glands and ducts are double, opening wide\r\napart on the basal pair of abdominal legs (Fig. 3). Moreover, their\r\nhead-appendages, which are single, with spines on the basal joint, are\r\nvery primitive and morphologically nearer in shape to those of the worms\r\n(Syllidæ, etc.) than even those of the Crustacea. Besides, their four\r\npairs of coxal glands, with an external opening at the base of the fifth\r\npair of head-appendages, and which probably are modified nephridia\r\n(Crustacea having but a single pair in any one form, either opening out\r\non the second antennal, green gland, or second maxillary, shell-gland,\r\nsegment), indicate a closer approximation to the polynephrous worms.\r\nLimulus has other archaic features, especially as regards the structure\r\nof the simple and compound eyes and the simple nature of the brain.\r\n\r\n=The Trilobita.=—These archaic forms are still more generalized and\r\nprimitive than the Merostomata and Crustacea, and probably were the\r\nfirst Arthropoda to be evolved from some unknown annelid worm. They had\r\njointed biramose limbs of nearly uniform shape and size on each segment\r\nof the body, which were not, as in Crustacea, differentiated into\r\nantennæ, jaws (mandibles), maxillæ, maxillipeds, and two kinds of legs\r\n(thoracic and abdominal), showing that they are a much more primitive\r\ntype, and nearer to the annelids than any other Arthropoda. Their gills,\r\nas shown by the researches of Walcott and of Beecher, were attached to\r\nnearly if not every pair of limbs behind the antennæ (Figs. 1, 2). The\r\nfact that in Trilobita the first pair of limbs is antenniform does not\r\nprove that they are Crustacea, since Eurypterus has a similar pair of\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—Restored section of Calymene: _C_, carapace; _en_, endopodite;\r\n    _en′_, exopodite; with the gills on the epipodal or respiratory part\r\n    of the appendage.—After Walcott.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe limbs in trilobites, as well as the abdominal ones of merostomes,\r\nand all those of Crustacea, except the first antennæ, are biramose,\r\nconsisting of an outer (exopodite) and an inner division (endopodite).\r\nIn this respect the terrestrial air-breathing tracheate forms,\r\nArachnida, Myriopoda, and Insecta, differ from the branchiate forms, as\r\ntheir legs are single or undivided, being adapted for supporting the\r\nbody during locomotion upon the solid earth. It is to be observed that\r\nwhen, as in Limulus, the body is supported by cephalic ambulatory limbs,\r\nthey are single, while the abdominal limbs, used as they are in\r\nswimming, are biramose, much as in Crustacea.\r\n\r\n=The Arachnida.=—The scorpions and spiders are much less closely allied\r\nto the myriopods and insects than formerly supposed. Their embryology\r\nshows that they have descended from forms related to Limulus, possibly\r\nhaving had an origin in common with that animal, or having, as some\r\nauthors claim, directly diverged from some primitive eurypteroid\r\nmerostome. But they differ in essential respects, and not only in the\r\nnature and grouping of their appendages; the first pair instead of\r\nantenniform being like mandibles, and the second pair like the maxillæ,\r\nwith the palps, of insects, the four succeeding segments (thoracic)\r\nbearing each a pair of legs. They also have a brain quite unlike that of\r\nLimulus, the nervous cord behind the brain, however, being somewhat\r\nsimilar, though that of Limulus differs in being enveloped by an\r\narterial coat. Arachnida respire by tracheæ, besides book-lungs, which,\r\nhowever, are possibly derivatives of the book-gills of Limulus, while\r\nthey perform the office of excretion by means of the malpighian tubes,\r\nand like Limulus possess two large digestive glands (“liver”). Their\r\nembryos have, on at least six abdominal segments, rudiments of limbs,\r\nthree pairs of which form the spinnerets, showing their origin from\r\nLimulus-like or eurypteroid forms; their coxal glands are retained from\r\ntheir eurypteroid ancestors. The Arachnida probably descended from\r\nmarine merostomes, and not from an independent annelid ancestry, hence\r\nwe have represented them in the diagram on p. 3 as branching off from\r\nthe merostomatous phylum, rather than from an independent one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—Paired genital openings of different classes of arthropods.\r\n    _A_, the most primitive, of _Limulus polyphemus_: _gen. p_,\r\n    generative papillæ; _d_, duct; _vd_, vas deferens; _t_, tendinous\r\n    stigmata; _stig_, stigmata; _e_, external branchial muscle; _ant_,\r\n    anterior lamellar muscle.—After Benham, with a few changes. _B_,\r\n    lobster (_Homarus vulgaris_), ♀: _oe_, genital aperture on 3d pair\r\n    of legs; _ov_, ovary; _u_, unpaired portion of the same; _od_,\r\n    oviduct. _C_, ♀, scorpion: _ov_, ovary, with a single external\r\n    opening. _D_, ♂: _t_, testis; _vd_, vasa deferentia; _sb_, seminal\r\n    vesicle; _a_, glandular appendage; _p_, penis.—After Blanchard. _E_,\r\n    a myriopod (_Glomeris marginata_, ♀): _os_, ovarian sac, laid open;\r\n    _od_, paired oviducts. _F_, ♂: _t_, testis; _gvd_, common vas\r\n    deferens; _pa_, paired ducts.—After Favre, from Lang. _G_, _Lepisma\r\n    saccharina_, young ♂: _vd_, vas deferens, _ed_, ejaculatory duct;\r\n    _ga_, external appendages.—After Nassonow. _H_, Ephemera, ♂, showing\r\n    the double outlets.—After Palmén.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe characters in which arachnids approach insects, such as tracheæ and\r\nmalpighian tubes (none occur, as a rule, in marine or branchiate\r\narthropods), may be comparatively recent structures acquired during a\r\nchange from a marine to a terrestrial life, and not primitive heirlooms.\r\n\r\nArachnida also show their later origin than merostomes by the fact that\r\ntheir sexual glands are in most cases single, and though with rare\r\nexceptions the ducts are paired, these finally unite and open externally\r\nby a common single genital aperture in the median line of the body, at\r\nthe base of the abdomen (Fig. 3, _C_, _D_). In this respect Limulus,\r\nwith its pair of genital male or female openings, situated each at the\r\nend of a papilla, placed widely apart at the base of the first abdominal\r\nlimbs, is decidedly more archaic. Unlike Crustacea and insects,\r\nArachnida do not, except in the mites (Acarina), which is a very much\r\nmodified group, undergo a metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the insects, with the Myriopoda, are somewhat\r\nisolated from the other Arthropoda. The Myriopoda have a single pair of\r\nantennæ, and as they have other characters in common with insects, Lang\r\nhas united the two groups in a single class _Antennata_; but, as we\r\nshall see, this seems somewhat premature and unnecessary. Yet the two\r\ngroups have perhaps had a common parentage, and may prove to belong to a\r\ndistinct, common phylum.\r\n\r\nNot only by their structure and embryology, as well as their\r\nmetamorphosis, do the myriopods and insects stand apart from the\r\nArachnida and other arthropods, but it seems probable that they have had\r\na different ancestry, the arthropods being apparently polyphyletic.\r\n\r\nThere are two animals which appear to connect the insects with the\r\nworms, and which indicate a separate line of descent from the worms\r\nindependent of that of the other classes. These are the singular\r\nPeripatus, which serves as a connecting link between arthropods and\r\nworms, and Scolopendrella (Symphyla). These two animals are guide-posts,\r\npointing out, though vaguely to be sure, the way probably trod by the\r\nforms, now extinct, which led up to the insects.\r\n\r\n=Relations of Peripatus to Insects.=—We will first recount the\r\ncharacteristics of this monotypic class. Peripatus (Fig. 4) stands\r\nalone, with no forms intermediate between itself and the worms on the\r\none hand, and the true Arthropoda on the other. Originally supposed to\r\nbe a worm, it is now referred to a class by itself, the Malacopoda of\r\nBlainville, or Protracheata of Haeckel. It lives in the tropics, in damp\r\nplaces under decaying wood. In general appearance it somewhat resembles\r\na caterpillar, but the head is soft and worm-like, though it bears a\r\npair of antenna-like tentacles. It may be said rather to superficially\r\nresemble a leech with clawed legs, the skin and its wrinkles being like\r\nthose of a leech. There is a pair of horny jaws in the mouth, but these\r\nare more like the pharyngeal teeth of worms than the jaws of arthropods.\r\nThe numerous legs end each in a pair of claws. The ladder-like nervous\r\nsystem is unlike that of annelid worms or arthropods, but rather recalls\r\nthat of certain molluscs (Chiton, etc.), as well as that of certain flat\r\nand nemertine worms. Its annelid features are the large number of\r\nsegmentally arranged true nephridia, and the nature of the integument.\r\nIts arthropodan features, which appear to take it out of the group of\r\nworms, are the presence of tracheæ, of true salivary and slime glands,\r\nof a pair of coxal glands (Fig. 4, _C_, _cd_) as well as the claws at\r\nthe end of the legs. The tracheæ, which are by no means the only\r\narthropodan features, are evidently modified dermal glands. The heart is\r\narthropodan, being a dorsal tube lying in a pericardial sinus, with many\r\nopenings. This assemblage of characters is not to be found in any marine\r\nor terrestrial worm.\r\n\r\nThe tracheæ (Fig. 4, _D_, _tr_) are unbranched fine tubes, without a\r\n“spiral thread,” and are arranged in tufts, in _P. edwardsii_ opening by\r\nsimple orifices or pores (“stigmata”) scattered irregularly over the\r\nsurface of the body; but in another species (_P. capensis_) some of the\r\nstigmata are arranged more definitely in longitudinal rows,—on each side\r\ntwo, one dorsally and one ventrally. “The stigmata in a longitudinal row\r\nare, however, more numerous than the pairs of legs.” (Lang.)\r\n\r\nThe salivary glands, opening by a short common duct into the under side\r\nof the mouth, in the same general position as in insects, are evidently,\r\nas the embryology of the animal proves, transformed nephridia, and being\r\nof the arthropodan type explain the origin and morphology of those of\r\ninsects. It is so with the slime glands; these, with the coxal glands,\r\nbeing transformed and very large dermal glands. Those of insects arose\r\nin the same manner, and are evidently their homologues, while those of\r\nPeripatus were probably originally derived from the setiparous glands in\r\nthe appendages (parapodia) of annelid worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—_A_, _Peripatus novæ zealandiæ_.—After Sedgwick, from Lang.\r\n    _B_, _Peripatus capensis_, side view, enlarged about twice the\r\n    natural size.—After Moseley, from Balfour. _C_, Anatomy of\r\n    _Peripatus capensis_.

In the male\r\nthe ejaculatory duct is single; in its base a spermatophore is formed.\r\nIt will be seen, then, that Peripatus is not only a composite type, and\r\na connecting link between worms and tracheate arthropods, but that it\r\nmay reasonably be regarded, if not itself the ancestor, as resembling\r\nthe probable progenitor of myriopods and insects, though of course there\r\nis a very wide gap between Peripatus and the other antennate,\r\nair-breathing Arthropoda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—_E_, _Peripatus edwardsii_, head from the under side: _a_,\r\n    base of antenna; _op_, oral papilla; the figure also shows the\r\n    papillæ around the mouth, and the four jaws.—After Balfour, from\r\n    Lang. _F_, Anterior end of _Peripatus capensis_, ventral side, laid\r\n    open: _a_, antenna; _z_, tongue; _k_, jaw; _sd_, salivary gland;\r\n    _gs_, union of the two salivary glands; _ph_, pharynx; _œ_,\r\n    œsophagus; _l_, lip papillæ around the mouth; _op_, oral or slime\r\n    papilla; _sld_, duct or reservoir of the slime gland.—After Balfour,\r\n    from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Relation of Myriopods to Insects.=—The Myriopoda are the nearest allies\r\nof the insects. They have a distinct head, with one pair of antennæ. The\r\neyes are simple, with the exception of a single genus (Cermatia), in\r\nwhich they are aggregated or compound. The trunk or body behind the head\r\nis, as a rule, long and slender, and composed of a large but variable\r\nnumber of segments, of equal size and shape, bearing jointed legs, which\r\ninvariably end in a single claw.\r\n\r\nThe mouth-parts of the myriopods are so different in shape and general\r\nfunction from those of insects, that this character, together with the\r\nequally segmented nature of the portion of the body behind the head (the\r\ntrunk), forbids our merging them, as some have been inclined to do, with\r\nthe insects. There are two sub-classes of myriopods, differing in such\r\nimportant respects that by Pocock[1] and by Kingsley they are regarded\r\nas independent classes, each equivalent to the insects.\r\n\r\nOf these the most primitive are the Diplopoda (Chilognatha), represented\r\nby the galley-worms (Julus, etc.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—Mandible of Julus: _l_, lacinia; _g_, galea; _p_, dens\r\n    mandibularis; _ma_, “mala”; _lt_, lamina tritoria; _st_, stipes;\r\n    _c_, cardo; _m_, muscle.—After Latzel.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the typical Diplopoda the head consists of three segments, a preoral\r\nor antennal, and two postoral, there being two pairs of jaw-like\r\nappendages, which, though in a broad morphological sense homologues of\r\nthe mandibles and first maxillæ of insects, are quite unlike them in\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—Under lip or deutomala of _Scoterpes copei_: _hyp_, hypostoma\r\n    or mentum; _lam. lab_, lamina labialis; _stip. e_, stipes exterior;\r\n    with the malella exterior (_mal. e_) and malella interior (_mal.\r\n    i_); the stipes interior, with the malulella; and the labiella\r\n    (hypopharynx of Vom Rath) with its stilus (_stil._).\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs we have previously stated,[2] the so-called “mandibles” of diplopods\r\nare entirely different from those of insects, since they appear to be 2–\r\nor 3–jointed, the terminal joint being 2–lobed, thus resembling the\r\nmaxillæ rather than the mandibles of insects, which consist of but a\r\nsingle piece or joint, probably the homologue of the galea or molar\r\njoint of the diplopod protomala. The mandible of the Julidæ (Fig. 5,\r\n_Julus molybdinus_), Lysiopetalidæ, and Polydesmidæ consists of three\r\njoints; viz. a basal piece or cardo, a stipes, and the _mala\r\nmandibularis_, which supports two lobes analogous to the galea and\r\nlacinia of the maxilla of an insect. There is an approach, as we shall\r\nsee, in the mandible of Copris, to that of the Julidæ, but in insects in\r\ngeneral the lacinia is wanting, and the jaw consists of but a single\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nThe deutomalæ (gnathochilarium), or second pair of diplopod jaws, are\r\nanalogous to the labium or second maxillæ of insects, forming a\r\nflattened, plate-like under-lip, constituting the floor of the mouth\r\n(Fig. 6). This pair of appendages needs farther study, especially in the\r\nlate embryo, before it can be fully understood. So far as known, judging\r\nby Metschnikoff’s work on the embryology of the diplopods, these\r\nmyriopods seem to have in the embryo but two pairs of post-antennal\r\nmouth-parts, which he designated as the “mandibles” and “labium.”\r\nMeinert, however, regards as a third pair of mouth-parts or “labium”\r\nwhat in our Fig. 7 is called the internal stipes (_stip. i._), behind\r\nwhich is a triangular plate, _lamina labialis_ (_lam. lab_), which he\r\nregards as the sternite of the same segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—Deutomala of Julus, the lettering as in Fig. 6.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—Head of _Scolopendra_, seen from beneath, showing the\r\n    “mandible” (protomala) with its cardo (_card._) and stipes (_st._),\r\n    also the labrum and epilabrum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe hypopharynx, our “labiella,” (Fig. 6), with the supporting rods or\r\n_stili linguales_ (_sti. l_), of Meinert, are of nearly the same shape\r\nas in some insects.\r\n\r\nOf the clypeus of insects there is apparently no homologue in myriopods,\r\nthough in certain diplopods there is an interantennal clypeal region.\r\nThe labium of insects is represented by a short, broad piece, which,\r\nhowever, unlike that of insects, is immovable, and is flanked by a\r\nseparate piece called the _epilabrum_ (Fig. 8). Vom Rath has observed an\r\nepipharynx, which has the same general relations as in insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Larva of Julus: _a_, the 3d abdominal segment, with the new\r\n    limbs just budding out; _b_, new segments arising between the\r\n    penultimate and the last segment.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe embryology of myriopods is in many respects like that of insects.\r\nThe larva of diplopods hatches with but few segments, and with but three\r\npairs of limbs; but these are not, as in insects, appended to\r\nconsecutive segments, but in one species the third, and in another,\r\n_Julus multistriatus?_ (Fig. 10), the second, segment from the head is\r\nfootless, while Vom Rath represents the first segment of an European\r\nBlaniulus as footless, the feet being situated consecutively on segments\r\n2 to 4. The new segments arise at “the growing point” situated between\r\nthe last and penultimate segment, growing out in groups of sixes\r\n(Newport) or in our _Julus multistriatus?_ in fives (Fig. 10). In adult\r\nlife diplopods (Julus) have a single pair of limbs on the three first\r\nsegments, or those corresponding to the thoracic segments of insects,\r\nthe succeeding segments having two pairs to each segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—Freshly hatched larva of _Julus multistriatus?_ 3 mm. long:\r\n    _a_, 5 pairs of rudimentary legs, one pair to a segment.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Sinclair (Heathcote) regards each double segment in the diplopods as\r\n  not two original segments fused together, nor a single segment\r\n  bearing two pairs of legs, but as “two complete segments perfect in\r\n  all particulars, but united by a large dorsal plate which was\r\n  originally two plates which have been fused together.” (Myriopods,\r\n  1895, p. 71.) That the segments were primitively separate is shown,\r\n  he adds, by the double nature of the circulatory system, the nerve\r\n  cord, and the first traces of segmentation in the mesoblast. Kenyon\r\n  believes that from the conditions in pauropods, Lithobius, etc.,\r\n  there are indications of alternate plates (not segments) having\r\n  disappeared, and of the remaining plates overgrowing the segments\r\n  behind them, so as to give rise to the anomalous double segments.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—Sixth pair of legs of _Polyzonium germanicum_, ♀: _cs_,\r\n    ventral sacs; _cox_, coxa; _st_, sternal plate; _sp_,\r\n    spiracle.—After Haase.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDiplopods are also provided with eversible coxal sacs, in position like\r\nthose of Symphyla and Synaptera; Meinert, Latzel, and also Haase having\r\ndetected them in several species of Chordeumidæ, Lysiopetalidæ, and\r\nPolyzonidæ (Fig. 11). In _Lysiopetalum anceps_ these blood-gills occur\r\nin both sexes between the coxæ of the third to sixteenth pair of limbs.\r\nIn the Diplopods the blood-gills appear to be more or less permanently\r\neverted, while in Scolopendrella they are usually retracted within the\r\nbody (Fig. 15, _cg_).\r\n\r\nDiplopods also differ externally from insects in the genital armature, a\r\ncomplicated apparatus of male claspers and hooks apparently arising from\r\nthe sternum of the sixth segment and being the modified seventh pair of\r\nlegs. In myriopods there are no pleural pieces or “pleurites,” so\r\ncharacteristic of winged insects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fundamental difference between diplopods and insects is\r\nthe fact that the paired genital openings of the former are situated not\r\nfar behind the head between the second and third pair of legs. Both the\r\noviducts and male ejaculatory ducts are paired, with separate openings.\r\nThe genital glands lie beneath, while in chilopods they lie above the\r\nintestine; this, as Korschelt and Heider state, being a more primitive\r\nrelation, since in Peripatus they also lie above the digestive canal.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of diplopods is not only remarkable for the lack of\r\nthe tendency towards a fusion of the ganglia observable in insects, but\r\nfor the fact that the double segments are each provided with two\r\nganglia. The brain also is very small in proportion to the ventral cord,\r\nthe nervous system being in its general appearance somewhat as in\r\ncaterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the tracheæ and stigmata is much as in insects, but\r\nin the Diplopoda the tracheary system is more primitive than in\r\nchilopods, a pair of stigmata and a pair of tracheal bundles occurring\r\nin each segment, while the bundles are not connected by anastomosing\r\nbranches, branched tracheæ only occurring in the Glomeridæ. The tracheæ\r\nthemselves are without spiral threads (tænidia). It is noteworthy that\r\nthe tracheæ arise much later than in insects, not appearing until the\r\nanimal is hatched; in this respect the myriopods approximate Peripatus.\r\n\r\nIn the Chilopoda also the parts of the head, except the epicranium, are\r\nnot homologous with those of insects, neither are the mouth-parts, of\r\nwhich there are five pairs.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the head of centipedes is shown in part in Fig. 12,\r\ncompare also Fig. 8. It will be seen that it differs much from that of\r\nthe diplopods, though the mandibles (protomalæ) are homologous; they are\r\ndivided into a cardo and stipes, thus being at least two-jointed.\r\n\r\nThe second pair of postoral appendages is in centipedes very different\r\nfrom the gnathochilarium of diplopods. As seen in Fig. 12 2, they are\r\nseparate, cylindrical, fleshy, five-jointed appendages, the maxillary\r\nappendages of Newport, which are “connected transversely at their base\r\nwith a pair of soft appendages” (_c_), the lingua of Newport. The third\r\nand fourth pair are foot-jaws, and we have called them _malipedes_, as\r\nthey have of course no homology with the maxillipedes of Crustacea. The\r\nsecond pair of these malipedes, forming the last pair of\r\nmouth-appendages, is the poison-fangs (4), which are intermediate\r\nbetween the malipedes and the feet; Meinert does not allow that these\r\nare mouth-appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—Structure of a chilopod. _A_, _Lithobius americanus_, natural\r\n    size. _B_, under side of head and first two body-segments and legs,\r\n    enlarged: _ant_, antenna; 1, jaws; 2, first accessory jaw; _c_,\r\n    lingua; 3, second accessory jaw and palpus; 4, poison-jaw. (Kingsley\r\n    del.) _C_, side view of head (after Newport): _ep_, epicranium; _l_,\r\n    frontal plate; _sc_, scute; 1, first leg; _sp_, spiracle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe embryology of Geophilus by Metschnikoff shows plainly the four pairs\r\nof post-antennal appendages. The embryo Geophilus is hatched in the form\r\nof the adult, having, unlike the diplopods, no metamorphosis, its\r\nembryological history being condensed or abbreviated. But in examining\r\nMetschnikoff’s figures certain primitive diplopod features are revealed.\r\nThe body of the embryo shortly before hatching is cylindrical; the\r\nsternal region is much narrower than in the adult, hence the insertions\r\nof the feet are nearer together, while _the first six pairs of\r\nappendages begin to grow out before the hinder ones_. Thus the first six\r\npairs of appendages of the embryo Geophilus correspond to the antennæ,\r\ntwo pairs of jaws, and three pairs of legs of the larval Julus. These\r\nfeatures appear to indicate that the chilopods may be an offshoot from\r\nthe diplopod stem. The acquisition of a second pair of legs to a segment\r\nin diplopods, as in the phyllopod Crustacea, is clearly enough a\r\nsecondary character, as shown by the figures of Newport in his memoir on\r\nthe development of the Myriopoda (Pl. IV.). Thus the tendency in the\r\nMyriopoda, both diplopods and chilopods, is towards the multiplication\r\nof segments and the elongation of the body, while in insects the\r\npolypodous embryo has the three terminal segments of the abdomen well\r\nformed, these being, however, before hatching, partly atrophied, so that\r\nthe body of insects after birth tends to become shortened or condensed.\r\nThis indicates the descent of insects from ancestors with elongated\r\npolypodous hind-bodies like Scolopendrella. Korschelt and Heider suggest\r\nthat the stem-form of myriopods was a homonomously jointed form like\r\nPeripatus, consisting of a rather large number of segments, but we\r\nmight, with Haase, consider that the great number of segments which we\r\nnow find indicates a late acquisition of this form.\r\n\r\nThe genital opening in chilopods is single, and situated in the\r\npenultimate segment of the body, as in insects. While recognizing the\r\nclose relationship of the Myriopoda with the insects, it still seems\r\nadvisable not to unite them into a single group (as Oudemans, Lang, and\r\nothers would do), but to regard them as forming an equivalent class. On\r\nthe other hand, when we take into account the form and structure of the\r\nhead, antennæ, and especially the shape of the first pair of\r\nmouth-appendages, being at least two-jointed in both groups, we think\r\nthese characters, with the homonomously segmented body behind the head,\r\noutweigh the difference in the position of the genital outlet, important\r\nas that may seem. It should also be taken into account that while\r\ninsects are derived from polypodous ancestors, no one supposes, with the\r\nexception of one or two authors, that these ancestors are the Myriopoda,\r\nthe latter having evidently descended from a six-legged ancestor, quite\r\ndifferent from that of the Campodea ancestor of insects.[4]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sexual openings of worms, though their position is in\r\ngeneral in the anterior part of the body, it is still very variable,\r\nthough, in general, paired. In the oligochete worms the genital zone,\r\nwith the external openings, is formed by the segments lying between the\r\n9th and 14th rings, though in some the genital organs are situated still\r\nnearer the head. The myriopods, which evolved from the worms earlier\r\nthan insects, appear to have in their most primitive forms (the\r\nDiplopoda) retained this vermian position of the genital outlets. In the\r\nlater forms, the chilopods, the genital openings have been carried back\r\nto near the end of the body, as in insects. From observations made by\r\nthree different observers on the freshly hatched larva of the Julidæ, it\r\nappears that the ancestral diplopods were six-footed, or oligopod, the\r\nlarva of Pauropus (Fig. 13) approaching nearest to our idea of the\r\nancestral myriopod, which might provisionally be named Protopauropus.\r\n\r\n=Relations of the Symphyla to Insects.=—Opinions respecting the position\r\nof the Symphyla, represented by Scolopendrella (Fig. 14), are very\r\ndiscordant. By most writers since Newport, Scolopendrella has been\r\nplaced among the myriopods. The first author, however, to examine its\r\ninternal anatomy was Menge (1851), who discovered among other structures\r\n(tracheæ, etc.) the silk-glands situated in the last two segments, and\r\nwhich open at the end of each cercus. He regarded the form as “the type\r\nof a genus or family intermediate between the hexapod Lepismidæ and the\r\nScolopendridæ.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—_Pauropus huxleyi_, much enlarged. _A_, enlarged view of\r\n    head, antennæ, and first pair of legs (original). _B_, young.—After\r\n    Lubbock. _C_, longitudinal section of _Pauropus huxleyi_, ♂: _a_,\r\n    brain; _b_, salivary gland; _k_, mid-intestine; _g_, rectum; _h_,\r\n    ventral nerve-cord; _c_, bud-like remnants of coxæ; _d_, penis; _e_,\r\n    vesicula seminalis; _f_, ductus glandularis; _i_^1, divisions of\r\n    testes.—After Kenyon.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1873[5] the writer referred to this form as follows: “It may be\r\nregarded as a connecting link between the Thysanura and Myriopoda, and\r\nshows the intimate relation of the myriopods and the hexapods, perhaps\r\nnot sufficiently appreciated by many zoölogists.”\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Ryder regarded it as “the last survival of the form from which\r\ninsects may be supposed to have descended,” and referred it to “the new\r\nordinal group Symphyla, in reference to the singular combination of\r\nmyriopodous, insectean, and thysanurous characters which it\r\npresents.[6]”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—_Scolopendrella immaculata_, from above,—after Lang; also\r\n    from beneath, the genital opening on the 4th trunk-segment: _sac_,\r\n    eversible or coxal sac; _an_, anus; _c_, cereopod; _v_, vestigial\r\n    leg.—After Haase, from Peytoureau. _A_ _B_ _C_, head and buccal\r\n    appendages of _Scolopendrella immaculata_: _A_, head seen from\r\n    above; _cl_, clypeus. _B_, head from beneath; _l_, first pair of\r\n    legs; _mx_, 1st maxilla; _mx_^1, 2d maxilla; _t_, “labial plates” of\r\n    Latzel, labium of Muhr. _C_, 1st maxilla; _l_, lacinia; _g_, galea;\r\n    _p_, rudiment of the palpus.—After Latzel. _D_, end of the body:\r\n    _p__{11}, eleventh, _p__{12}, twelfth undeveloped pair of legs;\r\n    _p__{13}, modified, vestigial legs, bearing tactile organs (_so_);\r\n    _sg_, cercopod, with duct of spinning gland, _dg_; _cd_, eversible\r\n    or coxal gland; _h_{8}s_, coxal spur of the 11th pair of legs.—After\r\n    Latzel from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWood-Mason considered it to be a myriopod, and “the descendant of a\r\ngroup of myriopods from which the Campodeæ, Thysanura, and Collembola\r\nmay have sprung.” We are indebted to Grassi for the first extended work\r\non the morphology of Scolopendrella (1885). In 1886 he added to our\r\nknowledge facts regarding the internal anatomy, and gives a detailed\r\ncomparison with the Thysanura, besides pointing out the resemblances of\r\nScolopendrella to Pauropus, diplopods, chilopods, as well as Peripatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—Section of _Scolopendrella immaculata_: _œ_, œsophagus; _oe.\r\n    v_, œsophageal valve entering the mid-intestine (“stomach”); _i_,\r\n    intestine; _r_, rectum; _br_, brain; _ns_, abdominal chain of\r\n    ganglia; _ovd_, oviduct; _ov_, ovary; _s. gl_, silk-gland, and _op_,\r\n    its outer opening in cercus, _ur. t_, urinary tube; _cg_, coxal\r\n    glands or blood-gills.—Author _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Grassi expressed his view as to the position of the Symphyla,\r\nstating that it should not be included in the Thysanura, since it\r\nevidently has myriopod characters; these being the supraspinal vessel,\r\nthe ventral position of the genital glands; the situation of the genital\r\nopening in the fourth segment of the trunk, its ganglionic chain being\r\nlike that of diplopods, its having limbs on all the segments, etc. On\r\nthe other hand, Grassi has with much detail indicated the points of\r\nresemblance to the Thysanura. The principal ones are the thin\r\nintegument, the want of sympathetic ganglia, the presence of a pair of\r\ncephalic stigmata, like that said to occur in certain Collembola, and in\r\nthe embryo of Apis; two endoskeletal processes situated near the ventral\r\nfascia of the head; the epicranial suture also occurring in Thysanura,\r\nCollembola, Orthoptera, and other winged insects, and being absent in\r\ndiplopods and chilopods. He also adds that the digestive canal both in\r\nSymphyla and Thysanura is divided into three portions; the malpighian\r\ntubes in Thysanura present very different conditions (there being none\r\nin Japyx), among which may be comprised those of Scolopendrella. In both\r\ngroups there is a single pair of salivary glands. The cellular\r\nepithelium of the mid-intestine of Scolopendrella is of a single form as\r\nin Campodea and Japyx. The fat-body, dorsal vessel, with its valves and\r\nostia, are alike in the two groups, as are the appendages of the end of\r\nthe abdomen, the anal cerci (cercopoda) of Scolopendrella being the\r\nhomologues of the multiarticulate appendages of Lepisma, etc., and of\r\nthe forceps of Japyx. In those of Scolopendrella, we have found the\r\nlarge duct leading from the voluminous silk-gland, a single large sac\r\nextending forwards into the third segment from the end of the body (Fig.\r\n15, _s. gl_). Other points of resemblance, all of which he enumerates,\r\nare the slight differences in the number of trunk-segments, the presence\r\nin the two groups of the abdominal “false-legs” (parapodia), the dorsal\r\nplate, and the mouth-parts. As regards the latter, Grassi affirms that\r\nthere is a perfect parallelism between those of Scolopendrella and\r\nThysanura. To this point we will return again in treating more\r\nespecially of those of the Symphyla. Finally, Grassi concludes that\r\nthere is “a great resemblance between the Thysanura and Scolopendrella.”\r\nHe, however, believed that the Symphyla are the forerunners of the\r\nmyriopods, and not of the insects, his genealogical tree representing\r\nthe symphylan and thysanuran phyla as originating from the same point,\r\nthis point also being, rather strangely, the point of origin of the\r\narachnidan phylum.\r\n\r\nHaase (1889) regarded Scolopendrella as a myriopod, and Pocock (1893)\r\nassigned the Symphyla to an independent class, regarding Scolopendrella\r\nas “the living form that comes nearest to the hypothetical ancestor of\r\nthe two great divisions of tracheates.” Schmidt’s work (1895) on the\r\nmorphology of this genus is more extended and richly illustrated than\r\nGrassi’s, his method of research being more modern. He also regards this\r\nform as one of the lower myriopods.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it appears to us that, on the whole, if we throw out the\r\nsingle characteristic of the anteriorly situated genital opening, the\r\novarian tubes being directed toward the end of the body (Fig. 15, _ovd_,\r\n_ov_), there is not sufficient reason for placing the Symphyla among the\r\nMyriopoda, either below or near the diplopods. This is the only valid\r\nreason for not regarding Scolopendrella as the representative of a group\r\nfrom which the insects have descended, and which partly fills the wide\r\nabyss between Peripatus and insects. With the view of Pocock, that both\r\ninsects and myriopods have descended from Scolopendrella, we do not\r\nagree, because this form has so many insectean features, and a single\r\nunpaired genital opening. For the same reason we should not agree with\r\nSchmidt in interpolating the Symphyla between the Pauropoda and\r\nDiplopoda. In these last two progoneate groups the genital openings are\r\npaired, hence they are much more primitive types than Scolopendrella, in\r\nwhich there is but a single opening. It seems most probable that the\r\nSymphyla, though progoneate, are more recent forms than the progoneate\r\nmyriopods, which have retained the primitive feature of double sexual\r\noutlets. It is more probable that the Symphyla were the descendants of\r\nthese polypodous forms. Certainly Scolopendrella is the only extant\r\narthropod which, with the sole exception of the anteriorly situated\r\ngenital opening, fulfils the conditions required of an ancestor of\r\nThysanura, and through them of the winged insects. No one has been so\r\nbold as to suggest the derivation of insects from either diplopods or\r\nchilopods, while their origin from a form similar to Scolopendrella\r\nseems not improbable. Yet Uzel has very recently discovered that\r\nCampodea develops in some respects like Geophilus, the primitive band\r\nsinking in its middle into the yolk, with other features as in\r\nchilopods.[7] The retention of a double sexual opening in the diplopods\r\nis paralleled by the case of Limulus with its double or paired sexual\r\noutlets, opening in a pair of papillæ, as compared with what are\r\nregarded as the generalized or more primitive Crustacea, which have an\r\nunpaired sexual opening.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of the structural features of the Symphyla, as\r\nrepresented by Scolopendrella, is based mainly on the works of Grassi,\r\nHaase, and Schmidt, with observations of my own.\r\n\r\n=Diagnostic or essential characters of Symphyla.=—_Head shaped as in\r\nThysanura (Cinura), with the Y-shaped tergal suture, which occurs\r\ncommonly in insects (Thysanura, Collembola, Dermaptera, Orthoptera,\r\nPlatyptera, Neuroptera, etc.), but is wanting in Myriopoda (Diplopoda\r\nand Chilopoda); antennæ[8] unlike those of Myriopoda in being very long,\r\nslender, and moniliform. Clypeus distinct. Labrum emarginate, with six\r\nconverging teeth. Mandibles 2–jointed, consisting of a vestigial stipes\r\nand distal or molar joint, the latter with eight teeth. First maxillæ\r\nwith an outer and inner mala situated on a well-developed stipes; with a\r\nminute, 1–jointed palpus. Second pair of maxillæ: each forming two\r\noblong flat pieces, median sutures distinct, with no palpi; these pieces\r\nare toothed in front, and appear to be homologous with the two median\r\npieces of the gnathochilarium of Diplopoda. Hypopharynx? Epipharynx?_\r\n\r\n_Trunk with from fifteen to sixteen dorsal, more or less free subequal\r\nscutes, the first the smallest. Pedigerous segments twelve; also twelve\r\npairs of 5–jointed legs, which are of nearly equal length, the first\r\npair 4–, the others 5–jointed, all ending in two claws, as in Synaptera\r\nand winged insects. A pair of 1–jointed anal cerci homologous with those\r\nof Thysanura and Orthoptera, into each of which opens a large abdominal\r\nsilk-gland. Abdominal segments with movable styles or “pseudopods”\r\n(“Parapodia” of Latzel and of Schmidt), like those of Campodea and\r\nMachilis, and situated on the base of the coxal joint in front of the\r\nventral sac. Within the body near the base of each abdominal style is an\r\neversible coxal sac or blood-gill (Fig. 15, cg). The single genital\r\nopening is on the fourth trunk-segment in both sexes (Fig. 15, indicated\r\nby the arrow). The malpighian tubes (ur. t) are two in number, opening\r\ninto the digestive canal at the anterior end of the hind intestine; they\r\nextend in front to the third or second segment from the head. They are\r\nbroad and straight at their origin, becoming towards the end very\r\nslender and convoluted._\r\n\r\n_The three divisions of the digestive tract are as in insects, the\r\nepithelium of the mid-gut being histologically as in Campodea and Japyx;\r\nrectal glands are present. A pair of very large salivary glands are\r\nsituated in the first to the fourth trunk-segments, consisting of a\r\nglandular portion with its duct, which unite into a common duct opening\r\non the under side of the head, probably in the labium._\r\n\r\n_But a single pair of stigmata is present, and these are situated in the\r\nfront of the head, beneath the insertion of the antennæ and within the\r\nstipes of the mandibles; the tracheæ are very fine, without spiral\r\nthreads (tænidia), and mostly contained within the head, two fine\r\nbranches extending on each side into the second trunk-segment._\r\n\r\n_After birth the body increases in length by the addition of new\r\nsegments at the growing point._\r\n\r\nIn respect to the nervous system, there are no diagnostic characters;\r\nthere are, however, not as many as two pairs of ganglia to a segment.\r\nThe brain is well developed, sending a pair of slender nerves to the\r\nsmall eyes. The ganglia of the segment bearing the first pair of legs is\r\nfused with the subœsophageal ganglion. Grassi was unable to detect a\r\ntrue sympathetic system, but he suspects the existence of a very small\r\nfrontal ganglion.\r\n\r\nThe slender dorsal vessel, provided with ostia and valvules, pulsates\r\nalong the entire length of the trunk; an aorta passes into the head.\r\n\r\nThe internal genital organs of both sexes are paired, and extend along\r\nthe greater part of the trunk; in either sex they may be compared to two\r\nlong, slender, straight cords extending from the fourth to the tenth\r\npair of legs. The two oviducts do not unite before reaching the sexual\r\nopening (Fig. 15, _ovd_).\r\n\r\nThe male sexual organs are more complicated than the feminine. The\r\npaired testicular tubes lie in trunk-segments 6 to 12, on each side, and\r\npartly under the intestinal canal, communicating with each other by a\r\ncross-anastomosis situated under the intestine, and which, like the\r\ntestes, is filled with sperm. Of the paired seminal ducts (vas deferens)\r\nin trunk-segment 4, each unites again into a thick tube, sending a blind\r\ntube forward into the third segment. Under the place of union of the two\r\nvasa deferentia arise the paired ductus ejaculatorii, which open beneath\r\nin the uterus masculinus. The anterior blind ends of the vasa deferentia\r\nform a sort of small paired vesiculæ seminales in which a great quantity\r\nof ripe sperm is stored. The uterus masculinus is in its structure\r\nhomologous with the evaginable penis of Pauropus, Polyxenus, and some\r\ndiplopods, and the sexual opening has without doubt become secondarily\r\nunpaired. The sexual opening is rather long and is closed by two\r\nlongitudinal folds. “In several respects the male sexual organs of\r\nScolopendrella are like those of Pauropus; in the last-named form we\r\nhave indeed an unpaired testis, but also in Scolopendrella we see the\r\nbeginning of such a singleness; namely, the presence of an anastomosis\r\nuniting the two tubes, their communication by means of a transverse\r\nconnecting canal and a glandular structure in the epithelium forming\r\nthem. The male sexual organs of Pauropus differ only through a still\r\ngreater complication.” (Schmidt.)\r\n\r\nScolopendrella in habits resembles chilopods, being found in company\r\nwith Geophilus burrowing deep in light sand under leaves, or living at\r\nthe surface of the ground under sticks or stones. It is very agile in\r\nits movements, and is probably carnivorous. It was considered by Haase\r\nto be eyeless, but the presence of two ocelli has been demonstrated both\r\nby Grassi and by Schmidt. Whether the pigment and corneous facet are\r\npresent is not certain. The embryology is entirely unknown (although\r\nHenshaw reports finding a hexapodous young one), and it need not be said\r\nthat a knowledge of it is a very great desideratum. It is most probable\r\nthat the young is hexapodous, since the first pair of limbs are\r\n4–jointed, all the rest 5–jointed; while Newport, and also Ryder,\r\nobserved specimens with nine, ten, eleven, and twelve pairs, and\r\nWood-Mason confirms their observations, “which prove that a pair of legs\r\nis added at each moult,” and he concludes that the addition of new\r\nsegments “therefore takes place in this animal by the intercalation of\r\ntwo at each moult between the antepenultimate and penultimate sterna, as\r\nin the Chilognatha, and as also in some of the Chilopoda.”\r\n\r\nThere is but one family, Scolopendrellidæ, and a single genus,\r\nScolopendrella, which seems to be, like other archaic types,\r\ncosmopolitan in its distribution.\r\n\r\n  Our commonest species is _S. immaculata_ Newport, which occurs from\r\n  Massachusetts to Cordova, Mexico, and in Europe from England to the\r\n  Mediterranean and Russia; Mr. O. F. Cook tells me he has found a\r\n  species in Liberia, West Africa. The other species are _S.\r\n  notacantha_ Gervais, Europe and Eastern United States; _S. nivea_\r\n  Scopoli (_S. gratiæ_ Ryder), Europe and United States; _S. latipes_\r\n  Scudder, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LITERATURE ON SCOLOPENDRELLA\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Newport, George.= Monograph of the class Myriopoda, order Chilopoda.\r\n    (Trans.

Head small and flattened or\r\nrounded, composed of not less than six segments, and bearing, besides\r\nthe eyes, at least four pairs of jointed appendages_; i.e. _one pair of\r\nantennæ, and three pairs of masticatory appendages, the distal or molar\r\nportion of which is primarily divided into three divisions, supported on\r\na stipes and cardo, and in certain orders modified into piercing or\r\nsucking structures. The head is composed of an epicranium, bearing a\r\ndistinct clypeus and labrum, with the epipharynx. Mandibles 1–jointed,\r\nwithout a palpus and very generally with no, or uncertain, traces of a\r\nlacinia and a stipes. Two pairs of maxillæ; the first pair separate,\r\nusually 3–lobed, comprising a lacinia, galea, and palpifer, with a\r\npalpus which is never more than 6–jointed. The second pair united to\r\nform the labium or under lip, composed of two laciniæ fused together; in\r\nthe generalized forms with a rudimentary galea; bearing a pair of palpi,\r\nnever more than 4–jointed; with paraglossæ sometimes present._\r\n\r\n(_A third pair of mouth-appendages situated between the antennæ and\r\nmandibles in the embryo of Anurida, and Apis, and adult Campodea._)\r\n\r\n_The epipharynx forming the roof of the mouth, and bearing gustatory\r\norgans. Hypopharynx usually well developed, lying on the under side of\r\nthe mouth, just above the labium, and receiving the end of the salivary\r\nduct._\r\n\r\n_Eyes of two kinds: a pair of compound, and from two to three simple\r\neyes (ocelli)._\r\n\r\n_The thorax consisting of three segments, the two latter segments in the\r\nwinged orders highly differentiated into numerous tergal and lateral\r\npieces and a single sternum; in the Synaptera the segments are\r\nundivided. (In the higher Hymenoptera the basal abdominal segment\r\ncoalesced with the thorax.) Three pairs of legs, each foot ending in a\r\npair of claws. Two pairs of wings (except in the Synaptera), a pair to\r\neach of the two hinder thoracic segments; the wings occasionally reduced\r\nor wanting in certain adaptive forms, which, however, had winged\r\nancestors._\r\n\r\n_Abdomen consisting at the most of from ten to twelve segments. No\r\nfunctional abdominal legs except in the Thysanura, and in the larvæ of\r\nLepidoptera. A pair of 1– or many-jointed cercopods on the tenth\r\nsegment; and in certain forms a pair of styles on the ninth segment. In\r\ncertain orders an ovipositor or sting formed of three pairs of styliform\r\nprocesses; in Collembola a single pair of processes forming the elater._\r\n\r\n_The genital openings opisthogoneate, usually single, but paired in\r\nThysanura (Lepisma), Dermaptera, and Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ)._\r\n\r\n_The digestive canal in the winged orders is highly differentiated, the\r\nfore-intestine being divided into an œsophagus and proventriculus, the\r\nhind-intestine into an ileum, colon, and rectum, with rectal glands._\r\n\r\n_The nervous system consists of a well-developed brain, in the more\r\nspecialized orders highly complicated; no more than thirteen pairs of\r\nganglia, which may be more or less fused in the more specialized orders.\r\nThree frontal ganglia, and a well-developed, sympathetic system\r\npresent._\r\n\r\n_Stigmata confined (except possibly in Sminthurus) to the thorax and\r\nabdomen, not more than ten pairs in all, and usually but nine pairs.\r\nTracheal system as a rule highly differentiated; invariably with\r\ntænidia._\r\n\r\n_Dorsal vessel with ostia and valvules; no arteries except the cephalic\r\naorta; no veins. After birth there is in the more specialized pterygote\r\norders a reduction in the number of terminal segments of the abdomen._\r\n\r\n_Development either direct (Synaptera), or with an incomplete (with\r\nnymph and winged or imaginal stages), or complete metamorphosis; in the\r\nlatter case with a larval, pupal, and imago stage._\r\n\r\nThe insects may be divided into two sub-classes,—the _Synaptera_, and\r\nthe winged orders, _Pterygota_, of Gegenbaur (1877), since the\r\ndifferences between the two groups appear on the whole to be of more\r\nthan ordinal rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. EXTERNAL ANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _a._ The regions of the body\r\n\r\nThe insects differ from other arthropods in that the body is divided\r\ninto three distinct regions,—the head, thorax, and abdomen, the latter\r\nregions in certain generalized forms not always very distinctly\r\ndifferentiated. The body behind the head may also conveniently be called\r\nthe trunk, and the segments composing it the trunk-segments.\r\n\r\nIn insects the head is larger in proportion to the trunk than in other\r\nclasses, notably the Crustacea; the thorax is usually slightly or\r\nsomewhat larger than the head, while the hind-body or abdomen is much\r\nthe larger region, as it consists of ten to eleven, and perhaps in the\r\nDermaptera and Orthoptera twelve, segments, and contains the mid- and\r\nhind-intestine, as well as the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the body of an insect with that of a worm, in which the\r\nrings are distinctly developed, we see that in insects ring distinctions\r\nhave given way to regional distinctions. The segments lose their\r\nindividuality. It is comparatively easy to trace the segments in the\r\nhind-body of an insect, as in this region they are least modified; so\r\nwith the thorax; but in the head of the adult insect it is impossible to\r\ndiscover the primitive segments, as they are fused together into a sort\r\nof capsule, and have almost entirely lost their individuality.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the head contains or bears the organs of\r\nsense and of prehension and mastication of the food; the thorax the\r\norgans of locomotion; and the abdomen those of reproduction.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the body of a wasp or bee with that of a worm, we see\r\nthat there is a decided transfer of parts headward; this process of\r\ncephalization so marked in the Crustacea likewise obtains in insects.\r\nAlso the two hinder regions of the body are, in a much greater degree\r\nthan in worms, governed by the brain, the principal seat of the\r\nintelligence, which, so to speak, dominates and unifies the functions of\r\nthe body, both digestive, locomotive, and reproductive, as also those of\r\nthe muscles moving the different segments and regions of the body. To a\r\nlarge extent arthropodan morphology and class distinctions are based on\r\nthe regional arrangement of the somites themselves. Thus in the process\r\nof grouping of the segments into the three regions, some increase in\r\nsize, while others undergo a greater or less degree of reduction; one\r\nsegment being developed at the expense of one or more adjoining ones.\r\nThis principle was first pointed out by Audouin, and is called Audouin’s\r\nlaw. It is owing to the greater development of certain segments and the\r\nreduction of others, both of the body-segments and of the segments of\r\nthe limbs, that we have the wonderful diversity of form in the species\r\nand genera, and higher groups of insects, as well as those of other\r\narthropods.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _b._ The integument (exoskeleton)\r\n\r\nThe skin or integument of insects consists, primarily, as in worms and\r\nall arthropods, of an epithelial layer of cells called the _hypodermis_.\r\nThis layer secretes the cuticle, which is of varying thickness and\r\nflexibility, and is usually very dense, impermeable, and light, compared\r\nwith the crust of the Crustacea, where the cuticle becomes heavy and\r\nsolid by the deposition of the carbonate and phosphate of lime. This is\r\ndue to the presence of a substance called by Odier chitin.[9] The\r\ncuticle is thin, delicate, and flexible between the joints; it is\r\nlikewise so in such diaphanous aquatic larvæ as that of Corethra, and in\r\nthe gills of aquatic insects, also in the walls of the tracheæ and of\r\nthe salivary ducts. The cuticle thus forms a more or less solid crust\r\nwhich is broken into joints and pieces (sclerites), forming supports for\r\nthe attachments of the muscles and serving to protect the soft parts\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n=Chitin.=—If we allow an insect to soak for a long time in acids, or\r\nboil it in liquid potassa or caustic potash, the integument is not\r\naffected. The muscles and the other soft parts are dissolved, leaving\r\nthe cuticle clear and transparent. This insolubility of the cuticle is\r\ndue to the presence of chitin, the insoluble residue left after such\r\ntreatment. It also resists boiling in acids, in any alkalies, alcohol or\r\nether. The chemical formula is C_{15}H_{26}N_{2}O_{10}.[10]\r\n\r\n  “Chitin forms less than one-half by weight of the integument, but it\r\n  is so coherent and uniformly distributed that when isolated by\r\n  chemical reagents, and even when cautiously calcined, it retains its\r\n  original organized form. The color which it frequently exhibits is\r\n  not due to any essential ingredient; it may be diminished or even\r\n  destroyed by various bleaching processes.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n  “The chemical stability of chitin is so remarkable that we might\r\n  expect it to accumulate like the inorganic constituents of animal\r\n  skeletons, and form permanent deposits. Schlossberger (Ann. d. chem.\r\n  u. pharm., bd. 98) has, however, shown that it changes slowly under\r\n  the action of water. Chitin kept for a year under water partially\r\n  dissolved, turned into a slimy mass, and gave off a peculiar smell.\r\n  This looks as if it were liable to putrefaction. The minute\r\n  proportion of nitrogen in its composition may explain the complete\r\n  disappearance of chitin in nature.” (Miall and Denny, The Cockroach,\r\n  p. 29.)\r\n\r\n  Chitin, or a substance closely similar to it, occurs in worms and in\r\n  their tubes, especially in the pharyngeal teeth of annelids and in\r\n  their setæ. The shell of Lingula and the pen of cuttle-fish contain\r\n  true chitin (Krukenberg). The integument of Limulus, of trilobites,\r\n  and of Arachnida, as well as Myriopoda, appears to consist of\r\n  chitin.[11]\r\n\r\nThe chitin is rapidly deposited at the end of embryonic life, also\r\nduring the larval and pupal stages. As is well known, insects after\r\nmoulting are white, but in a few hours turn dark, and those which live\r\nin total darkness are white, showing that light has a direct effect in\r\ncausing the dark color of the integument.\r\n\r\nMoseley analyzed one pound weight of Blatta, and found plenty of iron\r\nwith a remarkable quantity of manganese.\r\n\r\nSchneider regarded chitin as a hardening of the protoplasm rather than a\r\nsecretion, and the cuticle is looked upon as an exudation. It is\r\nstructureless, not consisting of cells, and consists of fine irregular\r\nlaminæ. “A cross-section of the chitinous layer or ‘cuticle’ examined\r\nwith a high power shows extremely close and fine lines perpendicular to\r\nthe laminæ.” In the cockroach the free surface of the cuticle is divided\r\ninto polygonal, raised spaces or areas which correspond each to a\r\nchitinous cell of the hypodermis. (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\nNumerous pore-canals pass through the cuticle of all the external parts\r\nof the body. The larger canals nearly always form the way for the\r\npassage of secretions from dermal cells, or connect with the cavities of\r\nhairs or setæ; when very fine and not connected with hairs or scales,\r\nthey are either empty or filled with air, and may possibly serve for\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nVosseler distinguishes in the cuticle two layers of different physical\r\nand chemical characters. Besides the external chitinous layer there is\r\nan inner layer which entirely agrees with cellulose. (Zool.\r\nCentralblatt, ii, 1895, p. 117.)\r\n\r\nThe reparative nature of chitin is seen in the fact that Verhoeff finds\r\nthat a wound on an adult Carabus, and presumably on other insects, is\r\nspeedily closed, not merely by a clot of blood, but by a new growth of\r\nchitin.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _c._ Mechanical origin and structure of the segments (somites,\r\n                    arthromeres, metameres, zonites)\r\n\r\nThe segments are merely thickenings of the skin connected by folds or\r\nduplications of the integument, and not actually separate or individual\r\nrings or segments. This is shown by longitudinal (sagittal) sections\r\nthrough the body, and also by soaking or boiling the entire insect in\r\ncaustic potash, when it is seen that the integument is continuous and\r\nnot actually subdivided into separate somites or arthromeres, since they\r\nare seen to be connected by a thin intersegmental membrane (Fig. 16).\r\nBut this segmentation or metamerism of the integument is, however, the\r\nexternal indication of the segmentation of the arthropodan body most\r\nprobably inherited from the worms, being a disposition of the soft parts\r\nwhich is characteristic of the vermian type. This segmentation of the\r\nintegument is correlated with the serial repetition of the ganglia of\r\nthe nervous system, of the ostia of the dorsal vessel, the primitive\r\ndisposition of the segmental and reproductive organs, of the soft,\r\nmuscular dissepiments which correspond to the suture between the\r\nsegments, and with the metameric arrangement of the muscles controlling\r\nthe movements of the segments on each other, and which internal\r\nsegmentation or metamerism is indicated very early in embryonic life by\r\nthe mesoblastic somites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—Diagram of the anterior part of an insect, showing the\r\n    membranous intersegmental folds, _g_.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the unjointed worms, as Graber states, the body forms a single but\r\nflexible lever. In the earthworm the muscular tube or body-wall is\r\nenclosed by a stiffer cuticle, divided into segments; hence the worm can\r\nmove in all required directions, but only by sections, as seen in Fig.\r\n16, which represents the thickened integument divided into segments, and\r\nfolded inward between each segment, this thin portion of the skin being\r\nthe intersegmental fold. Each segment corresponds to a special zone of\r\nthe subdivided muscular tube (_m_), the fascia extending longitudinally.\r\nThe figure shows the mode of attachment of the fascia of the muscle-tube\r\nto the segment. The anterior edge is inserted on the stiff, unyielding,\r\ninner surface of each segment: the hinder edge of the muscle is attached\r\nto the thin, flexible, intersegmental fold, which thus acts as a tendon\r\non which the muscle can exert its force. (Graber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—Diagram of the integument and arrangement of the segmental\r\n    muscles: _A_, relaxed; _m_, muscle; _g_, membranous articulation;\r\n    _r_, chitinous ring. _B_, the same contracted on both sides. _C_, on\r\n    one side.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Fig. 17 makes this still clearer. The muscles (_m_) extend between two\r\nsegments immediately succeeding each other. Supposing the anterior one\r\n(_A_) to be stationary, what do we then see when the muscle contracts?\r\nDoes it also become shorter? The intersegmental fold is drawn forwards,\r\nand hence the entire hinder segment moves forward and is shoved into the\r\nfront one, and so on with the others, as at _B_. Afterwards, if the\r\nstrain of the muscle is relieved by the diminishing action of the\r\ntensely stretched, intersegmental membrane, it again returns to a state\r\nof rest.” (Graber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—Diagrams to demonstrate the mechanism of the motion of the\r\n    segmented body in the Arthropoda: One larger segment (_cf_) and 4\r\n    smaller. The exoskeleton is indicated by black lines, the\r\n    interarticular membranes by dotted lines. The hinges between\r\n    consecutive segments are marked _at_, tergal (dorsal) skeleton; _s_,\r\n    sternal (ventral) skeleton; _d_, dorsal longitudinal muscles =\r\n    extensors (and flexors in an upward direction); _v_, ventral\r\n    longitudinal muscles = flexors. In _B_, the row of segments is\r\n    stretched; in _A_, by the contraction of the muscles (_d_) bent\r\n    upward; in _C_, downward; _tg_, tergal; _sg_, sternal interarticular\r\n    membranes.—After Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile we look upon the dermal tube of worms as a single but flexible\r\nlever, the body of the arthropods, as Graber states, is a linear system\r\nof stiff levers. We have here a series of stiff, solid rings, or hooks,\r\nunited by the intersegmental membrane into a whole. When the muscles,\r\nextending from one ring to the next behind contract, and so on through\r\nthe entire series, the rings approximate each other.\r\n\r\nThe ectoskeletal segments bend to one side by the contraction of the\r\nmuscles on one side, the point of the outer segmental fold opposite the\r\nfixed point becoming converted into the turning-point (_C_).\r\n\r\nThe usual result of the arrangement of the locomotive system is the\r\nsimple curving of the body (_C_), and then the alternate bending of the\r\nbody to right and left, which produces the serpentine movements\r\ncharacteristic of the earthworms, the centipede, and many insect larvæ.\r\nThe most striking example of the wonderful variety of movements which\r\ncan be made by an insect are those of the Syrphus larva. When feeding\r\namid a herd of aphides, it is seen to now raise the front part of the\r\nbody erect and stiff, then to bend it down, or rapidly turn it to either\r\nside, or move it in a complete circle. (Graber, pp. 23–26.)\r\n\r\nThe arrangement and mode of working of the muscles, says Lang, is\r\nillustrated by Fig. 18, which shows us five segments, one larger (_ct_)\r\nand four smaller, in vertical projection. The thicker portion of the\r\nintegument is marked by strong outlines, the delicate and flexible\r\ninterarticular membranes (_tg_, _sg_) in dotted lines. The hinges\r\nbetween two consecutive segments are marked _a_. A dorsal muscle (_d_)\r\nis attached to the larger segment (_ct_), and runs through the smaller\r\nsegments, being inserted in the dorsal portion of the crust (_t_) of\r\neach by means of a bundle of fibres. A ventral muscle (_v_) does the\r\nsame on the sternal side (_s_).\r\n\r\n“The skeletal segments,” adds Lang, “may be compared to a double-armed\r\nlever, whose fulcrum lies in the hinges. If the dorsal muscle contracts,\r\nit draws the dorsal arm of the lever (the tergal portion of the\r\nskeleton) in the direction of the pull towards the larger segments; the\r\ntergal interarticular membranes become folded, the ventral stretched,\r\nand the four segments bend upward (Fig. 18, _A_). If the ventral muscle\r\ncontracts, while at the same time the dorsal slackens, the row of\r\nsegments will be bent downwards (Fig. 18, _C_).”\r\n\r\nL. B. Sharp suggests, that in the Crustacea the rings formed by “the\r\nregularity and stress of muscular action” would be hardened by the\r\ndeposition of lime at the most prominent portion, _i.e._ between what we\r\nhave called the intersegmental folds. (American Naturalist, 1893, p.\r\n89.) Cope also states that “with the beginning of induration of the\r\nintegument, segmentation would immediately appear, for the movements of\r\nthe body and limbs would interrupt the deposit at such points as would\r\nexperience the greatest flexure. The muscular system would initiate the\r\nprocess, since flexure depends on its contractions, and its presence in\r\nanimals prior to the induration of the integuments in the order of\r\nphylogeny, furnishes the conditions required.” (The Primary Factors of\r\nOrganic Evolution, p. 268, 1895.)\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the jointed or metameric structure of the bodies of\r\ninsects and other arthropods is an inheritance from the segmented worms.\r\nIn the worms the body is a continuous dermo-muscular tube, while in\r\narthropods this tube is divided into regions, and the cuticle is thicker\r\nand more resistant. To go back to the incipient stages in the process of\r\nsegmentation of the body, we conceive that the worms probably arose from\r\na creeping gastrula-like form, the gastræa. The act of creeping\r\ngradually induced an elongated shape of the body. The movement of such\r\nan organism in a forward direction would gradually evolve a fore and\r\naft, dorsal and ventral, and bilateral symmetry. As soon as this was\r\nattained, as the effect of creeping over rough irregular surfaces there\r\nwould result mechanical lateral strains intermittently acting during the\r\nserpentine movements of the worm. The integument would, we can readily\r\nsuppose, tend to bend or yield, or become permanently wrinkled, at more\r\nor less regular intervals. The arrangement of the muscles would\r\ngradually conform to this habit of creeping, and finally the nervous\r\nsystem and other organs more directly connected with the creeping\r\nmovements of the organism would tend to be correlated in their\r\narrangement with that of the segments. In this way the homonomous\r\nsegments of the annelid body probably became developed, and their\r\nrelations and shapes were eventually fixed by inheritance. After this\r\nstage was reached, and limbs began to appear, the segments would tend to\r\nbecome heteronomous, and to be grouped into regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—_Dujardinia rotifera_, with jointed tentacles and caudal\r\n    appendages.—With some changes, after Quatrefages.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the joints or segments in the limbs of arthropods was\r\nprobably due to the mechanical strains to which what were at first soft\r\nfleshy outgrowths along the sides of the body became subjected. Indeed,\r\ncertain annelid worms of the family Syllidæ have segmented tentacles and\r\nparapodia, as in Dujardinia (Fig. 19). We do not know enough about the\r\nhabits of these worms to understand how this metamerism may have arisen,\r\nbut it is possibly due to the act of pushing or repeated efforts to\r\nsupport the body while creeping over the bottom among broken shells,\r\nover coarse gravel, or among seaweeds.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that the jointed structure of the limbs of\r\narthropods, if we are to attempt any explanation at all of the origin of\r\nsuch structure, was primarily due mainly to lateral strains and impacts\r\nresulting from the primitive endeavors of the ancestral arthropods to\r\nraise and to support the body while thus raised, and then to push or\r\ndrag it forward by means of the soft, partially jointed, lateral limbs\r\nwhich were armed with bristles, hooks, or finally claws.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by adaptation, or as the result of parasitism and\r\nconsequent lack of active motion, the original number of segments may by\r\ndisuse be diminished. Thus in adult wasps and bees, the last three or\r\nfour abdominal segments may be nearly lost, though the larval number is\r\nten. During metamorphosis the body is made over, and the number, shape,\r\nand structure of the segments greatly modified. In the female of the\r\nStylopidæ the thorax loses all traces of segments, and is fused with the\r\nhead, and the abdominal segments are faintly marked, losing their\r\nchitin.\r\n\r\nWhile the maxillæ have several joints, the mandibles are 1–jointed, but\r\nthere are traces of two joints in Campodea, certain beetles, etc. In the\r\nantenna there is a great elasticity in respect to the number of joints,\r\nwhich vary from one or two to a hundred or more. It is likewise so in\r\nthe thoracic legs, where the number of tarsal joints varies from one to\r\nfive; also in the cercopoda, the number of joints varying from one or\r\ntwo to twelve or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _d._ Mechanical origin of the limbs and of their jointed structure\r\n\r\nWe have already hinted at the mode of origin of the limbs of arthropods.\r\nLike the body or trunk, the limbs are chitinous dermo-muscular tubes,\r\nwith a dense solid cuticle, and internal muscles, and were it not for\r\ntheir division at more or less regular intervals into segments, forming\r\ndistinct sets of levers, set up by the strains in these tubular\r\nsupports, there would be no power of varied motion.\r\n\r\nEven certain worms, as already stated, have their tentacles and\r\nparapodia, or certain appendages of their parapodia, more or less\r\njointed, but there are no indications of claws or of any other hard\r\nchitinous armature at the extremity, and the skin is thin and soft.\r\n\r\nIn the most simple though not the most primitive arthropods, such as the\r\nTardigrades, whose body is not segmented, there are four pairs of short\r\nunjointed legs, ending each in two claws, which have probably arisen in\r\nresponse to the stimulus of pushing or dragging efforts.\r\n\r\nThe legs of Peripatus are unjointed, and have a thin cuticle, but end in\r\na pair of claws, which have evidently arisen as a supporting armature,\r\nthe result of the act of moving or pulling the body over the uneven\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—A prothoracic leg of Chironomus larva; and pupa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—_A_, larva of _Ephydra californica_: _a_, _b_, _c_, pupa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to suppose that such limbs arose from dynamical\r\ncauses, similar to those exciting the formation of secondary adaptations\r\nsuch as are to be seen in the prop or supporting legs of certain\r\ndipterous larvæ, as the single pair of Chironomus (Fig. 20) and\r\nSimulium, or the series of unjointed soft tubercles of Ephydra (Fig.\r\n21), etc., which are armed with hooks and claws, and are thus adapted\r\nfor dragging the insect through or over vegetation or along the ground.\r\n\r\nNow by frequent continuous use of such unjointed structures, the cuticle\r\nwould tend to become hard, owing to the deposit of a greater amount of\r\nchitin between the folds of the skin, until finally the body being\r\nelongated and homonomously segmented, the movements of walking or\r\nrunning would be regular and even, and we would have homonomously\r\njointed legs like those of the trilobites, or of the most generalized\r\nCrustacea and of Myriopoda.\r\n\r\nIn the most primitive arthropods,—and such we take it were on the whole\r\nthe trilobites, rather than the Crustacea,—the limbs were of nearly the\r\nsame shape, being long and slender and evenly jointed from and including\r\nthe antennæ, to the last pair of limbs of the abdominal region. In these\r\nforms there appear to be, so far as we now know, no differentiation into\r\nmandibles, maxillæ, maxillipedes, and thoracic legs, or into gonopoda.\r\nThe same lack of diversity of structure and function of the\r\nhead-appendages has survived, with little change, in Limulus. In the\r\ntrilobites (Fig. 1) none of the limbs have yet been found to end in\r\nclaws or forceps; being in this respect nearly as primitive as in the\r\nworms. Secondary adaptations have arisen in Limulus, the cephalic\r\nappendages being forcipated, adapted as supports to the body and for\r\npushing it onward through the sand or mud, while the abdominal legs are\r\nbroad and flat, adapted for swimming and bearing the broad gill-leaves.\r\n\r\nIt is thus quite evident that we have three stages in the evolution of\r\nthe arthropodan limb; _i.e._ 1, the syllid stage, of simple, jointed,\r\nsoft, yielding appendages not used as true supports (Fig. 19); 2, the\r\ntrilobite stage, where they are more solid, evenly jointed, but not\r\nending in claws; and by their comparatively great numbers (as in the\r\ntrilobite, Triarthrus) fully supporting the body on the bottom of the\r\nsea. In Limulus they are much fewer in number, thicker, and acting as\r\nfirm supports, the cephalic limbs of use in creeping, and ending in\r\nsolid claws. 3, The third stage is the long slender swimming\r\nhead-appendages of the nauplius stage of Crustacea.\r\n\r\nAs regards the evolution of limbs of terrestrial arthropods, we have the\r\nfollowing stages: 1, the soft unjointed limbs of Tardigrades, ending in\r\ntwo claws, and those of Peripatus, and the pseudo- or prop-legs of\r\ncertain dipterous larvæ; 2, finally the evolution of the long, solid,\r\njointed limbs of Pauropus and other primitive myriopods, the legs\r\nforming solid, firm supports elevating the body, and enabling the insect\r\nto drag itself over the ground or to walk or run. When the body is\r\nelongated and many-segmented, the legs are necessarily numerous; but\r\nwhen it is short, the legs become few in number, _i.e._ six, in the\r\nhexapodous young of myriopods and in insects, or eight in Arachnida.\r\nWhenever the legs are used for walking, _i.e._ to raise and support the\r\nbody, they end in a solid point or in a pair of forceps or claws. On the\r\nother hand, as in phyllopods, where the legs are used mainly for\r\nswimming, they are unarmed and are soft and membranous, or, as in the\r\nlimbs of the nauplius or zoëa stage of crustaceans, end in a simple soft\r\npoint, which often bears tactile setæ.\r\n\r\nThe tarsal joints are more numerous in order to give greater flexibility\r\nto the limb in seizing and grasping objects, both to drag the body\r\nforwards and to support it.\r\n\r\nUnlike those of the Crustacea, the limbs of insects are not primitively\r\nbiramose, but single, the three-lobed first maxillæ, and secondarily\r\nbilobed second maxillæ being the result of adaptation. Embryology on the\r\nwhole proves the truth of this assumption; the maxillæ of both pairs are\r\nat first single buds, afterwards becoming lobed. All the appendages of\r\nthe body, including the ovipositor or sting, are modified limbs, as\r\nshown by their embryological development.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in the crab, where the body is raised by the limbs\r\nabove the bottom, it is much shorter and more cephalized than in the\r\nshrimps. Also in the simply walking and running spiders, the hind-body\r\nis shorter than in scorpions, while in the running and flying insects,\r\nsuch as the Cicindelidæ, and in the swiftly flying flies and bees, there\r\nis a tendency to a shortening of the body, especially of the abdomen.\r\nThe long body of the dragon-fly is an impediment to flight, but\r\ncompensated for by the action of the large wings.\r\n\r\nThe arthropodan limb is a compound leverage system. It is, says Graber,\r\na lateral outgrowth of the trunk, which repeats in miniature that of the\r\nmain trunk, its single series of joints or segments forming a jointed\r\ndermo-muscular tube. Yet the lateral appendages of an insect differ from\r\nthe main trunk in two ways: (1) they taper to the end which bears the\r\ntwo claws, and (2) their segments are in the living animal arranged not\r\nin a straight line, but at different angles to each other. The basal\r\njoint turning on the trunk acts as the first of a whole series of\r\nlevers. The second joint, however, is connected with the musculature of\r\nthe first or basal joint, and thus each succeeding joint is moved on the\r\none preceding. Each lever, from the first to the last, is both an active\r\nand a passive instrument. (Graber.)\r\n\r\nWhile, however, as Graber states, the limbs possess their own sets of\r\nmuscles and can move by the turning of the basal joint, the labor is\r\nvery much facilitated, as is readily seen, by the trunk, though the\r\nlatter has to a great extent delegated its locomotive function to the\r\nappendages, which again divide its labor among the separate joints.\r\n\r\nGraber then calls attention to the analogy of the mechanics of\r\nlocomotion of insects to those of vertebrates. An insect’s and a\r\nvertebrate’s legs are constructed on the same general mechanical\r\nprinciples, the limbs of each forming a series of levers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—Diagram of the knee-joint of a vertebrate (_A_) and an\r\n    insect’s limb (_B_): _a_, upper; _b_, lower, shank, united at _A_ by\r\n    a capsular joint, at _B_ by a folding joint; _d_, extensor or\r\n    lifting muscle; _d_^1, flexor or lowering muscle of the lower joint.\r\n    The dotted line indicates in _A_ the contour of the leg.—After\r\n    Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 22, _A_, represents diagrammatically the knee joint of a\r\nvertebrate, and _B_ that of an insect; _a_, the femur or thigh, and _b_,\r\nthe tibia or shank. In the vertebrate the internally situated bones are\r\nbrought into close union and bend by means of a hinge-joint; so also in\r\nthe chitinous-skinned insect.\r\n\r\nThe stiff dermal tube of the insect acts as a lever by means of the thin\r\nintersegmental membrane (_c_) pushed in or telescoped in to the thigh\r\njoint, a special joint-capsule being superfluous. The muscles are in\r\ngeneral the same in both types; they form a circle. In both the shank is\r\nextended by the contraction of the upper muscles (_d_) and is bent by\r\nthe contraction of the lower (_d^1_). The intersegmental membrane of the\r\ninsect’s limb is in a degree a two-armed lever, whose pivot (_f_) lies\r\nin the middle. The internal invagination of the intersegmental fold\r\n(_B_, _g-h_) affords the necessary support to the muscles acting like\r\nthe tendon in the vertebrate. (Graber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—Primitive band or germ of a Sphinx moth, with the segments\r\n    indicated, and their rudimentary appendages: _c_, upper lip; _at_,\r\n    antennæ; _md_, mandibles; _mx_, _mx′_, first and second maxillæ;\r\n    _l_, _l′_, _l″_, legs; _al_, abdominal legs.—After Kowalevsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGraber also calls attention to the fact that this insect limb differs in\r\none important respect from that of land vertebrates. The leverage system\r\nin the last is divided at the end into five parallel divisions or\r\ndigits. In arthropods, on the contrary, all the joints succeed one\r\nanother in a linear series.\r\n\r\nIn insects, as well as in other arthropods, modifications of the limbs\r\nusually take the form of a simple reduction in the number of segments.\r\nThus while the normal number of tarsal joints is five, we have trimerous\r\nand dimerous Coleoptera, and in certain Scarabæidæ the anterior tarsi\r\nare lost.\r\n\r\nSavigny was the first, in 1816, in his great work, “Théorie des organes\r\nde la bouche des Crustacés et des Insectes,” to demonstrate that not\r\nonly were the buccal appendages of biting insects homologous with those\r\nof bugs, moths, flies, etc., but that they were homologous with the\r\nthoracic legs, and that thus a unity of structure prevails throughout\r\nthe appendages of the body of all arthropods. Oken also observed that\r\n“the maxillæ are only repeated feet.”\r\n\r\nWhat was modestly put forth as a theory by the French morphologist has\r\nbeen abundantly proved by the embryology of insects of different orders\r\nto be a fact. As shown in Fig. 23 the antennæ and buccal appendages\r\narise as paired tubercles exactly as the thoracic legs. The abdominal\r\nregion also bears similar embryonic or temporary limbs, all of which in\r\nthose insects without an ovipositor disappear, except the cercopoda,\r\nafter birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE EXTERNAL ANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                General\r\n\r\n  =Swammerdam, Johann.= Biblia naturæ.

The head contains the brain and accessory ganglia,\r\nthe mouth or buccal cavity, also the air-sacs in many winged forms, and\r\ngives support to the external organs of sense, the antennæ, and to the\r\nbuccal appendages, the larger part of the interior being filled with the\r\nmuscles moving these structures. The solid walls of the head serve as a\r\nlever or support for the attachment of these muscles, especially those\r\nof the mandibles. Thus there is a correlation between the large size of\r\nthe mandibles of the soldier white ants and ants, the head being\r\ncorrespondingly large to accommodate the great mandibular muscles. The\r\nother extreme is seen in the larva of Necrophilus (Fig. 24), with its\r\nlong slender neck and diminutive head.\r\n\r\n=The clypeus.=—This is that part of the head situated in front of the\r\nepicranium, and anterior to the eyes, forming the roof of the posterior\r\npart of the mouth, and is, as embryology shows, probably a tergal\r\nsclerite. It varies greatly in shape and size in the different orders of\r\ninsects. It is often divided into two parts, the _clypeus posterior_ and\r\n_clypeus anterior_, or which may be designated as the _post-_ and\r\n_ante-clypeus_ (Figs. 29, _B_).\r\n\r\n=The labrum.=—The “upper lip” or labrum is an unpaired flap-like piece\r\nhinged to the front edge of the clypeus, and may be seen to move up and\r\ndown when the insect moves its mandibles. It forms the roof of the\r\nanterior part of the mouth (Figs. 69, 74), and its inner side is lined\r\nwith a soft membrane, usually provided with hairs and sense-papillæ or\r\ncups, forming the epipharynx.\r\n\r\nThe labrum is more or less deeply bilobed, especially in caterpillars\r\nand in adult Staphylinidæ, and has been thought by some writers\r\n(Kowalevsky, Carrière, and also Chatin) to represent a pair of\r\nappendages, but Heymons (1895) refutes this view, stating as his reason\r\nthat the labrum arises between the two halves of the nervous system\r\n(protocerebrum), while all the true appendages arise on each side of the\r\nnervous system. (See also Fig. 34.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—Front view of the head of _C. spretus_: _E_, epicranium; _C_,\r\n    clypeus; _L_, labrum; _O_, _o_, ocelli; _e_, eye; _a_, antenna;\r\n    _md_, mandible; _mx_, portion of maxilla uncovered by the labrum;\r\n    _p_, maxillary palpus; _p′_, labial palpus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the fleas (Siphonaptera) both the clypeus and labrum are wanting.\r\n\r\nWhile it apparently forms an anterior specialized portion of the\r\nprocephalic lobes, Viallanes regarded it as belonging to the third, or\r\nhis tritocerebral, segment, since the labral nerves arise from the\r\ntritocerebral ganglia. But since in all the early as well as late stages\r\nof embryonic life it appears to be situated in front of the mouth, it\r\nwould seem to belong to the first segment.\r\n\r\nIn the embryo of Blatta it first appears as a thick crescentic fold\r\nbeing slightly divided anterior to the mouth, and in Doryphora it\r\nappears as a heart-shaped or deeply bilobed prominence situated in front\r\nof the mouth (Wheeler).\r\n\r\n=The epipharynx and labrum-epipharynx.=—The epipharynx is the under\r\nsurface or pharyngeal lining of the clypeus and labrum, forming the\r\nmembranous roof of the mouth. As it contains the organs of taste and has\r\nbeen generally overlooked by entomologists, we may dwell at some length\r\non its structure in different orders.\r\n\r\nRéaumur was, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the first author\r\nto describe and figure the epipharynx, which he observed in the honey\r\nbee and bumble bee, and called _la langue_, remarking that it closes the\r\nopening into the œsophagus, and that it is applied against the palate.\r\nAccording to Kirby and Spence, De Geer described the epipharynx of the\r\nwasp; and Latreille referred to it, calling it the _sous labre_.\r\n\r\nThe name _epipharynx_ was bestowed upon this organ by Savigny, who thus\r\nspeaks of that of the bees: “Ce pharynx est, à la vérité, non seulement\r\ncaché par la lèvre supérieure, mais encore exactement recouvert par un\r\norgane particulier que Réaumur a déjà décrit. C’est une sorte\r\nd’appendice membraneux qui est reçu entre les deux branches des\r\nmâchoires. Cette partie ayant pour base le bord supérieur du pharynx,\r\npeut prendre le nom d’_épipharynx_ ou d’_épiglosse_.”\r\n\r\nHe also describes that of Diptera. What Walter has lately proved to be\r\nthe epipharynx of Lepidoptera was regarded by Savigny and all subsequent\r\nwriters as the labrum.\r\n\r\nThe latest account of the function of this organ is that by Cheshire,\r\nwho states that the tube made by the maxillæ and labial palpi cannot act\r\nas a suction pipe, because it is open above. “This opening is closed by\r\nthe front extension of the epipharynx, which closes down to the maxillæ,\r\nfitting exactly into the space they leave uncovered, and thus the tube\r\nis completed from their termination to the œsophagus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—Epipharynx of _Phaneroptera angustifolia_: _cl_, clypeus;\r\n    _lbr. e_, labrum-epipharynx; _t_ _c_, taste cups, both on the\r\n    clypeal and on the labral regions.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—Epipharynx of _Hadenœcus subterraneus_, cave cricket.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that this organ is not mentioned in Burmeister’s Manual\r\nof entomology, in Lacordaire’s Introduction à l’entomologie, or by\r\nNewport in his admirable article _Insecta_ in Todd’s Cyclopedia of\r\nanatomy. Neither has Straus-Durckheim referred to or figured it in his\r\ngreat work on the anatomy of _Melolontha vulgaris_.\r\n\r\nIn their excellent work on the cockroach, Miall and Denny state that\r\n“The epipharynx, which is a prominent part in Coleoptera and Diptera, is\r\nnot recognizable in Orthoptera” (p. 45). We have, however, found it to\r\nbe always present in this order (Figs. 26, 27).\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that any modern writers have described or referred to\r\nthe epipharynx of the mandibulate orders of insects. Although Dr. G.\r\nJoseph speaks of finding taste-organs on the palate of almost every\r\norder of insects, especially plant-feeding forms, we are unable to find\r\nany specific references, his detailed observations being apparently\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\nThe epipharynx is so intimately associated with the elongated labium of\r\ncertain Diptera, that, with Dr. Dimmock, we may refer to the double\r\norgan as the labrum-epipharynx; and where, as in the lepidopterous\r\n_Micropteryx semipurpurella_, described and figured by Walter, and the\r\nPanorpidæ (Panorpa and Boreus), the labrum seems pieced out with a thin,\r\npale membranous fold which appears to be an extension of the epipharynx,\r\nbuilding up the dorsal end of the labrum, this term is a convenient one\r\nto use.\r\n\r\nIn the lower orders of truly mandibulate insects, from the Thysanura to\r\nthe Coleoptera, excluding those which suck in liquid food, such as the\r\nDiptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera, and the Mecoptera (Panorpidæ)\r\nwith their elongated head and feeble, small mandibles, the epipharynx\r\nforms a simple membranous palatal lining of the clypeus and labrum. In\r\nsuch insects there is no soft projecting or pendant portion, fitted to\r\nclose the throat or to complete a partially tubular arrangement of the\r\nfirst and second maxillæ.\r\n\r\nIn all the mandibulate insects, then, the epipharynx forms simply the\r\nunder surface or pharyngeal lining of the clypeus and labrum, the\r\nsurface being uniformly moderately convex, and corresponding in extent\r\nto that of the clypeus and labrum, posteriorly merging into the palatal\r\nwall of the pharynx; the armature of peculiar gathering-hairs sometimes\r\nspreading over its base, being continuous with those lining the mouth\r\nand beginning of the œsophagus. The suture separating the labrum from\r\nthe clypeus does not involve the epipharynx, though since certain\r\ngustatory fields lie under the front edge of the clypeus, as well as\r\nlabrum, one may in describing them refer to certain fields or groups of\r\ncups or pits as occupying a labral or clypeal region or position.\r\n\r\nThe lack of traces of a suture in the epipharynx corresponding to the\r\nlabral suture above, suggests that the labrum does not represent a pair\r\nof coalesced appendages, and that it, with the clypeus, simply forms the\r\nsolid cuticular roof of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe only soft structures seen between the epipharynx and labrum, besides\r\nthe nerves of special sense, are the elevator muscles of the labrum, and\r\ntwo tracheæ, one on each side.\r\n\r\nThe structure and armature of the epipharyngeal surface even besides the\r\ntaste-pits, taste-cups and rods, is very varied, the setæ assuming very\r\ndifferent shapes. There seem to be two primary forms of setæ, (1) the\r\nnormal forms which arise from a definite cell; and (2) soft, flattened,\r\noften hooked hairs which are cylindrical towards the end, but arise from\r\na broad triangular base, without any cell-wall. These are like the\r\n“gathering hairs” of Cheshire, situated on the bees’ and wasps’ tongue;\r\nthey also line the walls of the pharynx and extend toward the œsophagus.\r\nThey are also similar to the “hooked hairs” of Will. The first kind, or\r\nnormal setæ, are either simply defensive, often guarding the sense-cups\r\nor sensory fields on which the sense-cups are situated, or they have a\r\nnerve extending to them and are simply tactile in function.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the epipharynx, then, appears to be highly sensitive, and\r\nto afford the principal seat of the gustatory organs, which are\r\ndescribed under the head of organs of taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LITERATURE ON THE EPIPHARYNX\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Réaumur.= Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire des insectes, v, 1740, p.\r\n    318, Pl. 28, Figs. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 l.\r\n\r\n  =Kirby and Spence.= Intr. to entomology, iii, 1828, p. 457.\r\n\r\n  =De Geer.= ii, 1778; v, 26, Fig. 11, M.\r\n\r\n  =Kirby and Spence.= Pl. xii, Fig. 2 K.\r\n\r\n  =Latreille.= Organisation extérieure des insectes, p. 184.

(Psyche, v, pp. 193–199, 222–228, 1889.)\r\n\r\n=Attachment of the head to the trunk.=—The head is either firmly\r\nsupported by the broad prothoracic segment in Orthoptera, many beetles,\r\netc., into which it is more or less retracted, or it is free and\r\nattached by a slender neck, easily turning on the trunk, as in\r\ndragon-flies, flies, etc. In some insects there are several chitinous\r\nplates, situated on an island in the membrane on the under side of the\r\nneck; these are the “cervical sclerites” of Sharp, occurring “in\r\nHymenoptera, in many Coleoptera, and in Blattidæ.”\r\n\r\n=The basal or gular region of the head.=—At the hinder part of the head\r\nis the opening (occipital foramen) into the trunk. The cheek (gena) is\r\nthe side of the head, and to its inner wall is attached the mandibular\r\nmuscle; it thus forms the region behind the eye and over the base of the\r\nmandibles. In the Termitidæ, where the head is broad and flat, it forms\r\na distinct piece on the under side of the head bounding the gulo-mental\r\nregion (Fig. 28). In the Neuroptera (Corydalus, Fig. 29, and Mantispa,\r\nFig. 30) it is less definitely outlined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—Head of _Corydalus cornutus_, ♂: _A_, from above. _B_, from\r\n    beneath. _C_, from the side. _a. cly_, clypeus anterior; _p. cly_,\r\n    clypeus posterior; _lbr_, labrum; _md_, mandible; _mx_, base of\r\n    first maxilla; _mp_, its palpus; _m_, mentum; _sm_, submentum;\r\n    _plpr_, palpifer; _lig_, fused second maxillæ; _ant_, antenna;\r\n    _occ_, occiput.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—Head of _Termopsis angusticollis_, seen from beneath, showing\r\n    the gena and gula: _m_, mentum; _sm_, submentum; _labr_, under side\r\n    of the labrum; _x_, hypopharyngeal chitinous support.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAll the gulo-mental region of the head appears to represent the base of\r\nthe second maxillæ, and the question hence arises whether the submentum\r\nis not the homologue of the cardines of the first maxillæ fused, and the\r\nmentum that of the stipites of the latter also fused together. If this\r\nshould prove to be the case, the homologies between the two pairs of\r\nmaxillæ will be still closer than before supposed. Where the gula is\r\ndifferentiated, this represents the basal piece of the second maxillæ.\r\nIn Figs. 28, 29, 30, and 31, these three pieces are clearly shown to\r\nbelong to the second maxillary segment. It is evident that these pieces\r\nor sclerites belong to the second maxillary or labial segment of the\r\nhead, as does the occiput, which may represent the tergo-pleural portion\r\nof the segment. Miall and Denny also regarded the submentum as the basal\r\npiece of the second maxillæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—Head of _Mantispa brunnea_, under side: _e_, eye; other\r\n    lettering as in Fig. 29.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—Head of _Limnephilus pudicus_, under side: _e_, eye; _l_,\r\n    ligula; _p_, palpifer; _lp_, labial palpi.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The occiput= (Fig. 29, _B_, _C_), as stated beyond, is very rarely\r\npresent as a separate piece; in the adult insect we have only observed\r\nit in Corydalus. The occipital region may be designated as that part of\r\nthe head adjoining and containing the occipital foramen. Newport\r\nconsiders the occiput as that portion of the base of the head “which is\r\narticulated with the anterior margin of the prothorax. It is perforated\r\nby a large foramen, through which the organs of the head are connected\r\nwith those of the trunk. It is very distinct in Hydroüs and most\r\nColeoptera, and in some, the Staphylinidæ, Carabidæ, and Silphidæ is\r\nconstricted and extended backwards so as to form a complete neck.” (See\r\nalso p. 51.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—Interior and upper and under surface of the head of _Hydroüs\r\n    piceus_: _d_, clypeus; _e_, labrum; _g_, maxilla; _h_, its palpus;\r\n    _i_, labium; _k_, labial palpus; _p_, sutura epicranii; _q_,\r\n    cotyloid cavity; _r_, torulus; _s_, _v_, laminæ squamosa; _t_,\r\n    laminaæ posteriores; _u_, tentorium; _w_, laminæ orbitales; _x_, os\r\n    transversum; _y_, articulating cavity for the mandible; _z_, os\r\n    hypopharyngeum.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The tentorium.=—The walls of the head are supported or braced within by\r\ntwo beams or endosternites passing inwards, and forming a solid\r\nchitinous process or loop which extends in the cockroach downwards and\r\nforwards from the lower edge of the occipital foramen. “In front it\r\ngives off two long crura or props, which pass to the ginglymus, and are\r\nreflected thence upon the inner surface of the clypeus, ascending as\r\nhigh as the antennary socket, round which they form a kind of rim.”\r\n(Miall and Denny.) The œsophagus passes upwards between its anterior\r\ncrura, the long flexor of the mandible lies on each side of the central\r\nplate; the supraœsophageal ganglion rests on the plate above, and the\r\nsubœsophageal ganglion lies below it, the nerve cords which unite the\r\ntwo passing through the circular aperture. (Miall and Denny.) In\r\nColeoptera (Hydroüs) it protects the nervous cord which passes under it.\r\n(Newport, Fig. 32, _u_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—Posterior view of head of Anabrus; _t_, tentorium. Joutel\r\n    _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Anabrus the tentorium is V-shaped, the two arms originating on each\r\nside of the base of the clypeus next to the base of each mandible the\r\norigin being indicated by two small foramina partly concealed externally\r\nand passing inwards and backwards and uniting just before reaching the\r\nposterior edge of the large occipital foramen (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\n  Palmén regards the tentorium as representing a pair of tracheæ (with\r\n  the cephalic spiracles) which have become modified for supports or\r\n  for muscular attachment, since he finds that in Ephemera the\r\n  tentorium breaks across the middle during exuviation, each half\r\n  being drawn out of the head like the chitinous lining of a tracheal\r\n  tube. This view is supported by Wheeler, who has shown that the\r\n  tentorium of Doryphora originates from five pairs of invaginations\r\n  of the longitudinal commissures, and which are anterior to those of\r\n  the second maxillary segment. “These invaginations grow inwards as\r\n  slender tubes, which anastomose in some places. Their lumina are\r\n  ultimately filled with chitin.” (Jour. Morph., iii, p. 368.)\r\n\r\n  This view has also been held by Carrière and Cholodkowsky, but\r\n  Heymons concludes from his embryological studies on Forficula and\r\n  Blattidæ (1895) that it is unfounded. That this is probably the case\r\n  is proved by the fact that the apodemes of the thoracic region are\r\n  evidently not modified tracheæ, since the stigmata and tracheæ are\r\n  present.\r\n\r\n=Number of segments in the head.=—While it is taken for granted by many\r\nentomologists that the head of insects represents a single segment,\r\ndespite the circumstance that it bears four pairs of appendages, the\r\nmore careful, philosophical observers have recognized the fact that it\r\nis composed of more than a single segment. Burmeister recognized only\r\ntwo segments in the head; Carus and Audouin recognized three; Macleay\r\nand Newman four; Straus-Durckheim even so many as seven. Huxley supposed\r\nthat there are five segments bearing appendages, remarking, “if the eyes\r\nbe taken to represent the appendages of another somite, the insect head\r\nwill contain six somites.” (Manual of Anat. Invert. Animals, p. 398.)\r\n\r\nThese discordant views were based on the examination of the head in\r\nadult insects; but if we confine ourselves to the imago alone, it is\r\nimpossible to arrive at a solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nNewport took a step in the right direction when he wrote: “It is only by\r\ncomparing the distinctly indicated parts of the head in the perfect\r\ninsect with similar ones in the larva that we can hope to ascertain the\r\nexact number of segments of which it is composed.” He then states that\r\nin the head of _Hydroüs piceus_ are the remains of four segments, though\r\nstill in the next paragraph, when speaking of the head as a whole, he\r\nconsiders it as the first segment, “while,” he adds, “the aggregation of\r\nsegments of which it is composed we shall designate individually\r\n_subsegments_.”\r\n\r\nThat the head of insects is composed of four segments was shown on\r\nembryological grounds by the writer (1871) and afterwards by Graber\r\n(1879). The antennæ and mouth-parts are outgrowths budding out from the\r\nfour primitive segments of the head; the antennæ grow out from the under\r\nside of the procephalic lobes, and these should therefore receive the\r\nname of antennal lobes. In like manner the mandibles and first and\r\nsecond maxillæ arise respectively from the three succeeding segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—Embryo of _Anurida maritima_: _tc. ap_, minute temporary\r\n    appendage of the tritocerebral segment, the premandibular appendage;\r\n    _at_, antenna; _md_, mandible; _mx_^1, first maxilla; _mx_^2, second\r\n    maxilla; _p_^1–_p_^3, thoracic; _ap_^1, _ap_^2, abdominal\r\n    appendages; _an_, anus—After Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile the postoral segments and their appendages are readily seen to be\r\nfour in number, the question arises as to whether the eyes represent the\r\nappendages of one or more preoral segments. In this case embryology thus\r\nfar has not afforded clear, indubitable evidence. We are therefore\r\nobliged to rely on the number of neuromeres, or primitive ganglia. In\r\nthe postoral region of the head, as also in the trunk, a pair of\r\nneuromeres correspond to each segment. (See also under Nervous System,\r\nand under Embryology.) We therefore turn to the primitive number of\r\nneuromeres constituting the procephalic lobes or brain.\r\n\r\nFrom the researches of Patten, Viallanes, and of Wheeler, especially of\r\nViallanes, it appears that the brain or supraœsophageal ganglion is\r\ndivided into three primitive segments. (See Nervous System, Brain.) The\r\nantennæ are innervated from the middle division or deutocerebrum. Hence\r\nthe ocular segment, _i.e._ that bearing the compound and simple eyes, is\r\nsupposed to represent the first segment of the head. This, however, does\r\nnot involve the conclusion that the eyes are the homologues of the\r\nlimbs, however it may be in the Crustacea.\r\n\r\nThe second head-segment is the antennal, the antennæ being the first\r\npair of true jointed appendages.\r\n\r\nThe third segment of the head is very obscurely indicated, and the facts\r\nin proof of its existence are scanty and need farther elucidation.\r\n\r\nViallanes’ tritocerebral lobes or division of the brain is situated in a\r\nsegment found by Wheeler to be intercalated between the antennal and\r\nmandibular segments. He also detected in _Anurida maritima_, the\r\nrudiments of a pair of appendages, smaller than those next to it, and\r\nwhich soon disappear (Fig. 34, _tc. ap_). He calls this segment the\r\nintercalary.[12] Heymons (1895) designates it as the “Vorkiefersegment,”\r\nand it may thus be termed the premandibular segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—Head of embryo of honey bee: _B_, a little later stage than\r\n    _A_. _pr.m_, premandibular segment; _cl_, clypeus; _ant_, antenna;\r\n    _md_, mandible; _mx_, first maxilla; _mx′_, second maxilla; _sp_,\r\n    spiracle.—After Bütschli.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1870 Bütschli observed in the embryo of the honey bee the\r\nrudiments of what appeared to be a pair of appendages between the\r\nantennæ and mandibles, but, judging by his figures, nearer to and more\r\nlike the mandibles than the rudimentary antennæ (Fig. 35); they seemed\r\nto him “almost like a pair of inner antennæ.”\r\n\r\n“I find,” he says, “in no other insects any indication of this peculiar\r\nappendage, which at the time of its greatest development attains a\r\nlarger size than the antennæ, and which, afterwards becoming less\r\ndistinct, forms by fusion with that on the other side a sort of larval\r\nlower lip. That this appendage does not belong to the category of\r\nsegmental appendages is indicated by the site of its origin on the upper\r\nside of the primitive band.” (Zeitschr. wissen. Zool., xx, p. 538.)\r\n\r\nGrassi has also observed it in Apis, and regards it as the germ of a\r\nfirst, but deciduous, pair of jaws. In the embryo of Hylotoma Graber\r\n(Figs. 134, 135) found what he calls three pairs of “preantennal\r\nprojections,” one of which he thinks corresponds to the “inner antennæ”\r\nof Bütschli. This subject needs further investigation.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the procephalic lobes of the embryo of insects,\r\nwith the rudiments of the antennæ, constitute the primitive head, and\r\nperhaps correspond to the annelidan head, while gradually the antennal\r\nappendages were in the phylogenetic development of the class fused with\r\nthe two segments of the primary head. That the second maxillary segment,\r\nthe occiput, was the last to be added, and at first somewhat\r\ncorresponded in position to the poison-fangs of centipedes (Chilopods),\r\nis shown by our observations on the embryology of Æschna (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—Æschna nearly ready to hatch: 4, labium, between _T_ and _e_\r\n    the occipital tergite; 5–7, legs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—Head of embryo Nematus, showing the labial segment: _occ_,\r\n    forming the occiput; _cl_, clypeus; _lb_, labrum; _md_, mandible;\r\n    _mdm_, muscle of same; _mx_, maxilla; _mx′_, second maxilla\r\n    (labium); _oe_, œsophagus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mandibular segment appears to form a large part of the post-antennal\r\nregion of the epicranium on account of the great mandibular muscle which\r\narises from so large an area of the anterior region of the head (Fig.\r\n37).\r\n\r\nJudging from the embryo of Nematus (Fig. 37), the first maxillary\r\nsegment is tergally aborted, there being no tergo-pleural portion\r\nleft.[13]\r\n\r\nThe second maxillary segment tergally appears to be represented by the\r\noccipital region of the head.\r\n\r\nAll the gular region, including the submentum and mentum, probably\r\nrepresents the base of the labium or second maxillæ.[14] The so-called\r\n“occiput” forms the base of the head of Corydalus, a neuropterous\r\ninsect, which, however, is more distinct in the larva. In most other\r\nadult insects the occiput is either obsolete or fused with the hinder\r\npart of the epicranium. We have traced the history of this piece\r\n(sclerite) in the embryo of Æschna, a dragon-fly, and have found that it\r\nrepresents the tergal portion of the sixth or labial segment. In our\r\nmemoir on the development of this dragon-fly, Pl. 2, Fig. 9, the head of\r\nthe embryo is seen to be divided into two regions, the anterior, formed\r\nof the antennal, mandibular, and first maxillary segments, and the\r\nposterior, formed of the sixth or labial segment. This postoral segment\r\nat first appears to be one of the thoracic segments, but is afterwards\r\nadded to the head, though not until after birth, as it is still separate\r\nin the freshly hatched nymph (Fig. 4; see also Kolbe, p. 132, Fig. 59,\r\n_sq._ 5). A. Brandt’s figure of _Calopteryx virgo_ (Pl. 2, Fig. 19)\r\nrepresents an embryo of a stage similar to ours, in which the postoral\r\nor sixth (labial) segment is quite separate from the rest of the head.\r\nThe accompanying figure, copied from our memoir, also shows in a saw-fly\r\nlarva (_Nematus ventricosus_) the relations of the labial or sixth\r\nsegment to the rest of the head. The suture between the labial segment\r\nand the preoral part of the head disappears in adult life. From this\r\nsketch it would seem that the back part of the head, _i.e._ of the\r\nepicranium, may be made up in part of the tergite or pleurites of the\r\nmandibular segment, since the mandibular muscles are inserted on the\r\nroof of the head behind the eyes. It is this labial segment which in\r\nCorydalus evidently forms the occiput, and of which in most other\r\ninsects there is no trace in larval or adult life, unless we except\r\ncertain Orthoptera (Locusta), and the larva of the Dyticidæ.\r\n\r\nThe following table is designed to show the number and succession of the\r\nsegments of the head, with their respective segments.\r\n\r\n TABULAR VIEW OF THE SEGMENTS, PIECES (SCLERITES), AND APPENDAGES OF THE\r\n                                  HEAD\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════════════╤═══════════════════╤═══════════════════\r\n         NAME OF SEGMENT        │ PIECES OR REGIONS │ APPENDAGES, ETC.\r\n                                │OF THE HEAD-CAPSULE│\r\n ───────────┬───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n            │1.

Westwood and also\r\nGoureau made less complete but similar observations, though Westwood\r\nafterwards changed his opinion, and the same view was maintained by\r\nReinhard. Our own observations (as seen in Fig. 38) led us to suppose\r\nthat this was a mistaken view; that the larval head, being too small to\r\ncontain that of the semipupa, was simply pushed forward, as in\r\ncaterpillars. Bugnion, however, reaffirms it in such a detailed way that\r\nwe reproduce his account. He maintains that the views of Ratzeburg are\r\nexact and easy to verify in the chalcid genus Encyrtus, except, however,\r\nthat which concerns the ventral part and the posterior border of the\r\nprothoracic segment.\r\n\r\nAs the time of transformation approaches, the head of the larva, he\r\nsays, is depressed and soon concealed under the edge of the prothoracic\r\nsegment; the latter elongates, becomes thicker and more convex, and\r\nwithin can be seen the two oculo-cephalic imaginal buds. The head of the\r\nperfect insect is derived not only from the head of the larva, but also\r\nfrom the portion of the prothoracic segment which is occupied by the\r\nbuds, _i.e._ almost its entire dorsolateral face. But the hinder and\r\nventral part of this segment (which contains the imaginal buds of the\r\nfirst pair of legs) takes no part in the formation of the head; these\r\nparts, according to Bugnion, towards the end of the larval period\r\ndetaching themselves so as to become fused with the thorax and\r\nconstitute the pronotum and the prosternum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—Anterior half of larva of Encyrtus, ventral face, showing the\r\n    upper (wing) and lower (leg) thoracic imaginal buds: _b_, mouth;\r\n    _ch_, chitinous arch; _gl_, silk gland; _g_, brain; _n_, nervous\r\n    cord; _a_^1, bud of fore, _a_^2, bud of hind, wing; _p_^1–_p_^3,\r\n    buds of legs; _st_^1–_st_^3, stigmata.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—Anterior part of Encyrtus larva, 1.2 mm. in length; dorsal\r\n    face; the cellular masses beginning to form the buds of the wings,\r\n    eyes, and antennæ: _o_, eye bud; _e_, stomach.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—Older Encyrtus larva, lateral view, showing the buds of the\r\n    antennæ (_f_), legs, and wings; _oe_, œsophagus; _q_^1, _q_^2,\r\n    _q_^3, buds of the genital armature; _x_, rudiment of the sexual\r\n    gland (ovary or testis); _u_, urinary tube; _i_, intestine (rectum);\r\n    _a_, anus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—A still older larva, ready to transform. The imaginal buds of\r\n    the antennæ, eyes, wings, and legs have become elongated; lettering\r\n    as in Fig. 41.—This and Figs. 39–41 after Bugnion.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  This mode of formation of the head may be observed still more easily\r\n  in Rhodites, Hemiteles, and Microgaster, from the fact that their\r\n  oculo-cephalic buds are much more precocious, and that the eyes are\r\n  charged with pigment at a period when the insect still preserves its\r\n  larval form.\r\n\r\n  “... I believe that this mode of formation of the head occurs in all\r\n  Hymenoptera with apodous larvæ, in this sense; that a more or less\r\n  considerable part of the first thoracic segment is always soldered\r\n  to the head of the larva to constitute the head of the perfect\r\n  insect. The arrangement of the nervous system is naturally in accord\r\n  with this peculiarity of development, and the cephalic ganglia of\r\n  the larva to which the ocular blastems later adapt themselves, are\r\n  found not in the head, but in the succeeding segment (Figs. 39, 40,\r\n  41).\r\n\r\n  “Relying on these facts, I maintain that the encroachment of the\r\n  head on the prothorax is a consequence of the preponderance in size\r\n  of the brain, and indicates the superiority of the Hymenoptera over\r\n  other insects....”\r\n\r\n  That the pronotum is derived from the larval prothoracic segment is\r\n  proved by the fact that the first pair of stigmata becomes what\r\n  authors call the “prothoracic” stigmata of the perfect insect. But\r\n  Bugnion thinks that the projection which carries it, and which he\r\n  calls the shoulder (Figs. 41 and 42), belongs to the mesonotum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _b._ Appendages of the head\r\n\r\n=The antennæ.=—These are organs of tactile sense, but also bear\r\nolfactory, and in some cases auditory organs; they are usually inserted\r\nbetween or in front of the eyes, and moved by two small muscles at the\r\nbase, within the head. In the more generalized insects the antennæ are\r\nsimple, many-jointed appendages, the joints being equal in size and\r\nshape. The antennæ articulate with the head by a ball and socket joint,\r\nthe part on which it moves being called the _torulus_ (Fig. 32, _r_). In\r\nthe more specialized forms it is divided into the _scape_, the\r\n_pedicel_, and a _flagellum_ (or _clavola_); but usually, as in ants,\r\nwasps, and bees, there are two parts, the basal three-jointed one being\r\nthe scape, and the distal one, the usually long filiform flagellum. The\r\nantennæ, especially the flagellum, vary greatly in form in insects of\r\ndifferent families and orders, this variation being the result of\r\nadaptation to their peculiar surroundings and habits. The number of\r\nantennal joints may be one (Articerus, a clavigerid beetle), or two in\r\nPaussus and in _Adranes cœcus_ (Fig. 43^{12}), where they are short and\r\nclub-shaped; in flies (Muscidæ, etc.), they are very short and with few\r\njoints, and when at rest lying in a cavity adapted for their reception.\r\nIn the lamellicorn beetles the flagellum is divided into several leaves,\r\nand this condition may be approached in the serrate or flabellicorn\r\nantennæ of other beetles. In Lepidoptera, and in certain saw-flies and\r\nbeetles, they are either pectinate or bipectinate, being in one case at\r\nleast, that of the Australian Hepialid (_Abantiades argenteus_),\r\ntripectinate (Fig. 44), and in the dipterous (Tachinid) genus Talarocera\r\nthe third joint is bipectinate (Fig. 45). In Xenos and in Parnus they\r\nmay be deeply forked, while in Otiocerus, two long processes arise from\r\nthe base, giving it a trifid shape. In dragon-flies and cicadæ, they are\r\nminute and hair-like, though jointed, while in the larvæ of many\r\nmetabolous insects they are reduced to minute three-jointed tubercles.\r\nIn aquatic beetles, bugs, etc., the antennæ are short, and often, when\r\nat rest, bent close to the body, as long antennæ would impede their\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—Different forms of antennæ of beetles: 1, serrate; 2,\r\n    pectinate; 3, capitate (and also geniculate); 4–7, clavate; 8, 9,\r\n    lamellate; 10, serrate (Dorcatoma); 11, irregular (Gyrinus); 12,\r\n    two-jointed antenna of _Adranes cæcus_.—After LeConte. _a_, first\r\n    joint of flagellum of antenna of _Troctes silvarum_; _b_, of _T.\r\n    divinatorius_.—After Kolbe.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—Tripectinate antenna of an Australian moth.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile usually more or less sensorial in function, Graber states that the\r\nlongicorn beetles in walking along a slender twig use their antennæ as a\r\nrope-dancer does his balancing pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—Antenna of _Talarocera nigripennis_, ♂.—After Williston.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRecent examination of the sense-organs in the antennæ of an ant, wasp,\r\nor bee enables us, he says, to realize what wonderful organs the antennæ\r\nare. In such insects we have a rod-like tube which can be folded up or\r\nextended out into space, containing the antennal nerve, which arises\r\ndirectly from the brain and sends a branch to each of the thousands of\r\nolfactory pits or pegs which stud its surface. The antenna is thus a\r\nwonderfully complex organ, and the insect must be far more sensitive to\r\nmovements of the air, to odors, wave-sounds, and light-waves, than any\r\nof the vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThat ants appear to communicate with each other, apparently talking with\r\ntheir antennæ, shows the highly sensitive nature of these appendages.\r\n“The honey-bee when constructing its cells ascertains their proper\r\ndirection and size by means of the extremities of these organs.”\r\n(Newport.)\r\n\r\nHow dependent insects are upon their antennæ is seen when we cut them\r\noff. The insect is at once seriously affected, its central nervous\r\nsystem receiving a great shock, while it gives no such sign of distress\r\nand loss of mental power when we remove the palpi or legs. On depriving\r\na bee of its antennæ, it falls helpless and partially paralyzed to the\r\nearth, is unable at first to walk, but on partly recovering the use of\r\nits limbs, it still has lost the power of coördinating its movements,\r\nnor can it sting; in a few minutes, however, it becomes able to feebly\r\nwalk a few steps, but it remains over an hour nearly motionless. Other\r\ninsects after similar treatment are not so deeply affected, though bees,\r\nwasps, ants, moths, certain beetles, and dragon-flies are at first more\r\nor less stunned and confused.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ afford salient secondary sexual differences, as seen in the\r\nbroadly pectinated antennæ of male bombycine moths, certain saw-flies\r\n(Lophyrus), and many other insects.\r\n\r\nThe mouth-parts, buccal appendages, or trophi, comprise, besides the\r\nlabrum, the mandibles and maxillæ.\r\n\r\n=The mandibles.=—These are true jaws, adapted for cutting, tearing, or\r\ncrushing the food, or for defence, while in the bees they are used as\r\ntools for modelling in wax, and in Cetonia, etc., as a brush for\r\ncollecting pollen. They are usually opposed to each other at the tips,\r\nbut in many carnivorous forms their tips cross each other like shears.\r\nThey are situated below the clypeus on each side, and are hinged to the\r\nhead by a true ginglymus articulation, consisting of two condyles or\r\ntubercles to which muscles are attached, the principal ones being the\r\nflexor and great extensor (Fig. 48). They are solid, chitinous, of\r\nvaried shapes, and in the form of the teeth those of the same pair\r\ndiffer somewhat from each other (Fig. 46 _A_). In the pollen-eating\r\nbeetles (Cetoniæ) and in the dung-beetles (Aphodius, etc.) the edge is\r\nsoft and flexible. In the males of Lucanus, etc. (Fig. 47), and of\r\nCorydalus (Fig. 29), they are of colossal size, and are large and\r\nsabre-shaped in the larvæ of water-beetles, ant-lions, Chrysopa, etc.\r\nwhere they are perforated at the tips, through which the blood of their\r\nprey is sucked.\r\n\r\nWhile the mandibles are generally regarded as composed of a single\r\npiece, in Campodea and Machilis there appears to be an additional basal\r\npiece apparently corresponding to the stipes of the first maxilla, and\r\nseparated by a faint suture from the molar or distal joint. In Campodea\r\nthere is a minute movable appendage figured both by Meinert and by\r\nNassonow, which appears to represent the lacinia of the maxilla (Fig.\r\n48). Wood-Mason has observed in the mandibles of the embryo of a\r\nJavanese cockroach, _Blatta (Panesthia) javanica_, indications of “the\r\nsame number of joints as in that of chilognathous myriopods, or one less\r\nthan in that of Machilis.” Also he adds: “In both ‘larvæ’ and adults of\r\n_Panesthia javanica_ a faint groove crosses the ‘back’ of the mandible\r\nat the base. This groove appears to be the remains of the joint between\r\nthe third and apical segments of the formerly 4–segmented mandibles.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—Various forms of mandibles. _A_, right and left of Termopsis.\r\n    _A′_, showing at the shaded portion the “molar” of Smith. _B_,\r\n    _Termes flavipes_, soldier; _md_, its mandible. _C_, Panorpa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—_Chiasognathus grantii_, reduced.

B. Smith also considers it as\r\n“homologous to the lacinia of the maxilla”), and on examining it in _P.\r\ncornutus_ and a Nicaragua species (Fig. 49), we adopt his view, since we\r\nhave found that it is freely movable and attached by a tendon and muscle\r\nto the galea. In the rove beetles (Goërius, Staphylinus, etc.) and in\r\nthe subaquatic Heteroceridæ, instead of a molar process, is a membranous\r\nsetose appendage not unlike the coxal appendages of Scolopendrella,\r\nmovably articulated to the jaw, which he thinks answers to the molar\r\nbranch of the jaws in Blatta and Machilis. “It has its homologue in the\r\ndiminutive Trichopterygidæ in the firmly chitinized quadrant-shaped\r\nsecond mandibular joint, which is used in a peculiar manner in crushing\r\nthe food”; also in the movable tooth of the Passalidæ, and in the\r\nmembranous inner lobe of the mandibles of the goliath-beetles, etc.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Smith has clearly shown that the mandibles are compound in certain\r\nof the lamellicorns. In _Copris carolina_ (Fig. 50), he says, the small\r\nmembranous mandibles are divided into a basal piece (basalis), the\r\nhomologue of the stipes in the maxilla; another of the basal pieces he\r\ncalls the molar, and this is the equivalent of the subgalea, while a\r\nthird sclerite, only observed in Copris, is the _conjunctivus_, the\r\nlacinia (prostheca) being well developed. Smith therefore concludes\r\n“that the structure of the mandible is fundamentally the same as that of\r\nthe labium and maxilla, and that we have an equally complex organ in\r\npoint of origin. Its usual function, however, demands a powerful and\r\nsolid structure, and the sclerites are in most instances as thoroughly\r\nchitinized and so closely united to the others that practically there is\r\nonly a single piece, in which the homology is obscured.” (Trans. Amer.\r\nEnt. Soc., xix, pp. 84, 85. 1892.) From the studies of Smith and our\r\nobservations on Staphylinus, Passalus, Phanæus, etc. (Fig. 50, _A_, _B_)\r\nwe fully agree with the view that the mandibles are primarily 3–lobed\r\nappendages like the maxillæ. Nymphal Ephemerids have a lacinia-like\r\nprocess.

They are also completely atrophied in the adult Trichoptera,\r\nthough very large and functional in the pupa of these insects (Fig. 52),\r\nas also in the pupa of Micropteryx (Fig. 53). They are also wanting in\r\nthe imago of male Diptera and in the females of all flies except\r\nCulicidæ and Tabanidæ.\r\n\r\nThey are said by Dr. Horn to be absent in the adult _Platypsyllus\r\ncastoris_, though well developed in the larva; and functional mandibles\r\nare lacking in the Hemiptera.\r\n\r\n=The first maxillæ.=—These highly differentiated appendages are inserted\r\non the sides of the head just behind the mandibles and the mouth, and\r\nare divided into three lobes, or divisions, which are supported upon\r\ntwo, and sometimes three basal pieces, _i.e._ the basal joint or\r\n_cardo_, the second joint or _stipes_, with the _palpifer_, the latter\r\npresent in Termitidæ (Fig. 54, _plpgr_), but not always separately\r\ndeveloped (Fig. 55). The cardo varies in shape, but is more or less\r\ntriangular and is usually wedged in between the submentum and mandible.\r\nIt is succeeded by the stipes, which usually forms the support for the\r\nthree lobes of the maxilla, and is more or less square in shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—Mandible of _Eriocephala calthella_: _a_, _a′_, inner and\r\n    outer articulation; _s_, cavity of the joint (acetabulum); _A_, end\r\n    seen from one side of the cutting edge.—After Walter.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—_A_, Pupa of _Phryganea pilosa_.—After Pictet. _B_, mandibles\r\n    of pupa of _Molanna angustata_.—After Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.—Pupa of _Micropteryx purpuriella_, front view: _md_,\r\n    mandibles; _mx.p_, maxillary palpus, end drawn separately; _mx.’p_,\r\n    labial palpi; _lb_, labrum; _A_, another view from a cast skin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe three distal divisions of the maxilla are called, respectively,\r\nbeginning with the innermost, the _lacinia_, _galea_, and _palpifer_,\r\nthe latter being a lobe or segment bearing the _palpus_.

In the maxilla of the beetle Nemognatha (Fig. 57), the galea is\r\ngreatly elongated, the two together forming an imperfect tube or\r\nproboscis and reminding one of the tongue of a moth, while the lacinia\r\nis reduced. In the Mecoptera the lacinia and galea are closely similar\r\n(Fig. 58); in the Trichoptera only one of the lobes is present (Fig.\r\n59), while in the Lepidoptera the galea unites with its mate to form the\r\nso-called tongue (Fig. 60). The maxilla of the male of _Tegeticula\r\nyuccasella_ is normal, though the galeæ are separate; but in the female,\r\nwhat Smith regards as the palpifer (the “tentacle” of Riley) is\r\nremarkably developed, being nearly as long as the galea (Fig. 61) and\r\narmed with stout setæ, the pair of processes being adapted for holding a\r\nlarge mass of pollen under the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—Tongue of _Aletia xylina_, with the end magnified.—Pergande\r\n    _del._, from Riley. _A_, much reduced maxilla (_mx_) of _Paleacrita\r\n    vernata_; _mx.p_, palpus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 61.—_A_, maxilla of _Tegeticula yuccasella_, ♂: _g_, galea. _B_,\r\n    ♀: _pl_, enormously developed palpifer; _mx.p_, palpus; _c_, cardo;\r\n    _st_, stipes; _sty_, stylus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn coleopterous larvæ the maxillæ are 2–lobed (Fig. 62), the galea being\r\nundifferentiated, but in those of saw-flies the galea is present (Fig.\r\n63, _gal_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—Larva of _Rhagium lineatum_: _lat_, lateral view of head and\r\n    thoracic segments; _mx_, first maxilla; _ml_, undifferentiated\r\n    lacinia and galea; _v_, under side of head and pro- and meso-\r\n    thoracic segments; _v.m.s._, one of the middle ventral segments,\r\n    magnified six times; _mx′_, 2d maxilla.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt now seems most probable that in the first maxillæ we have the primary\r\nform of buccal appendage of insects, the appendage being composed of\r\nthree basal pieces with three variously modified distal lobes or\r\ndivisions; and that the mandibles and second maxillæ are modifications\r\nof this type.\r\n\r\nHow wonderfully the maxillæ of the Lepidoptera are modified, and the\r\npeculiar shapes assumed in the Diptera, Hymenoptera, and other groups,\r\nwill be stated in the accounts of those orders, but it is well to recall\r\nthe fact that in the most primitive and generalized moth, Eriocephala,\r\nthe lacinia is well developed (Fig. 64).\r\n\r\nAs Newport remarks, the office of the maxillæ in the mandibulate insects\r\nis of a twofold kind; since they are adapted not only for seizing and\r\nretaining the food in the mouth, but also as accessory jaws, since they\r\naid the mandibles in comminuting it before it is passed on to the\r\npharynx and swallowed. Hence, as the food varies so much in nature and\r\nsituation, it will be readily seen that the maxillæ, especially their\r\ndistal parts, vary correspondingly. Thus far no close observations on\r\nthe exact use of the first and second maxillæ have been published.\r\n\r\nThe palpi also are not only organs of touch, but in some cases act as\r\nhands and also bear minute sense-organs, the function of which is\r\nunknown, but would appear to be usually that of smell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63.—_Selandria_ larva, common on _Carya porcina_, with details of\r\n    mouth-parts: _leg_, leg; _mx_, maxilla; _gal_, galea; _lac_,\r\n    lacinia.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The second maxillæ.=—The “under-lip” or labium of insects is formed by\r\nthe fusion at the basal portion of what in the embryo are separate\r\nappendages, and which arise in the same manner as the first maxillæ.\r\nThey are invariably solidly united, no cases of partial or incomplete\r\nfusion being known. The so-called labium is situated in front of the\r\ngula or gular region, and is bounded on each side by the gena, or cheek.\r\nAs already observed, the second maxillæ appear to be the appendages of\r\nthe last or occipital segment of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—Maxilla of _Eriocephala calthella_: _l_, lacinia; _g_, galea;\r\n    _mx.p_, maxillary palpus; _st_, stipes; _c_, cardo.—After Walter.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second maxillæ are very much differentiated and vary greatly in the\r\ndifferent orders, being especially modified in the haustellate or\r\nsuctorial orders, notably the Hymenoptera and Diptera. In the\r\nmandibulate orders, particularly the Orthoptera, where they are most\r\ngeneralized and primitive in shape and structure, they consist of the\r\nfollowing parts: the _gula_ (a _postgula_ is present in Dermaptera),\r\n_submentum_ (lora of Cheshire, i, p. 91), _mentum_, _palpifer_, the\r\nlatter bearing the _palpi_; the _lingua_ (_ligula_) and _paraglossæ_,\r\nwhile the hypopharynx or lingua is situated on the upper side. The\r\nlabial palpi are of the same general shape as those of the first\r\nmaxillæ, but shorter, with very rarely more than three joints, though in\r\nPteronarcys there are four. Leon has detected vestigial labial palpi in\r\nseveral Hemiptera (Fig. 73). As to the exact nature and limits of the\r\ngula, we are not certain; it is not always present, and may be only a\r\ndifferentiation of the submentum, or the latter piece may be regarded as\r\na part of the gula.\r\n\r\nWe are disposed to consider the second maxillæ as morphologically nearly\r\nthe exact equivalents of the first pair of maxillæ, and if we adopt this\r\nview it will greatly simplify our conception of the real nature of this\r\ncomplicated organ. The object of the fusion of the basal portion appears\r\nto be to form an under-lip, in order both to prevent the food from\r\nfalling backwards out of the mouth, and, with the aid of the first pair\r\nof maxillæ, to pass it forward to be crushed between the mandibles, the\r\ntwo sets of appendages acting somewhat as the tongue of vertebrates to\r\ncarry and arrange or press the morsels of food between the teeth or\r\ncutting edges of the mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe spines often present on the free inner edges of the first and second\r\nmaxillæ (Figs. 54, 62) form rude combs which seem to clean the antennæ,\r\netc., often aiding the tibial combs in this operation.\r\n\r\nThe submentum and mentum, or the mentum when no submentum is\r\ndifferentiated (with the gula, when present), appear to be collectively\r\nhomologous with the cardines of the first pair of maxillæ, together with\r\nthe palpifers and the stipites.[15] These pieces are more or less\r\nsquare, and have a slightly marked median suture in Termitidæ, the sign\r\nof primitive fusion or coalescence.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive form of the second maxillæ occurs in the Orthoptera\r\nand in the Termitidæ. The palpifer is either single (Periplaneta,\r\nDiapheromera, Gryllidæ) or double (_Blatta orientalis_, Locustidæ). In\r\nPrisopus the single piece in front of the palpifer is in other forms\r\ndivided, each half (Blatta, Locustidæ, Acrydidæ) bearing the two\r\n“paraglossæ,” which appendages in reality are the homologues of the\r\nlacinia and galea of the first maxillæ.[16] In the Termitidæ (Fig. 65)\r\nthe lingua is not differentiated from the palpifer, and the two\r\nparaglossæ (or the lamina externa and interna of some authors) with the\r\npalpus are easily seen to be the homologues of the three lobes of the\r\nfirst maxillæ. In the Perlidæ (Pteronarcys, Fig. 66) the palpifer is\r\ndivided, while the four paraglossæ arise, as in Prisopus and\r\nAnisomorpha, from an undivided piece, the lingua not being visible from\r\nwithout. In the Neuroptera the lingua or ligula is a large, broad,\r\nsingle lobe, without “paraglossæ,” and the palpifer is either single\r\n(Myrmeleon, Fig. 67), or divided (Mantispa, Fig. 68). In Corydalus (Fig.\r\n29) the palpifer forms a single piece, and the lingua is undivided,\r\nthough lobed on the free edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—Second maxillæ of _Termopsis angusticollis_: _li_, the\r\n    homologue of the lacinia; _le_, galea.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the metabolic orders above the Neuroptera the lingua is variously\r\nmodified, or specialized, with no vestiges of the lacinia or galea,\r\nexcept in that very primitive moth, Eriocephala, in which Walter found a\r\nminute free galea, _me_, and an inner lobe (Figs. 76, 77), the lacinia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.—Second maxillæ of _Pteronarcys californica_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—Second maxillæ of _Myrmeleon diversum_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—Second maxillæ of _Mantispa brunnea_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The hypopharynx.=—While in its most generalized condition, as in\r\nSynaptera, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, and Neuroptera, this anterior median\r\nfold or outgrowth of the labium forming the floor of the mouth may\r\nretain the designation of “tongue,” lingua, or ligula; in its more\r\nspecialized form, particularly when used as a piercing or lapping organ,\r\nthe use of the name _hypopharynx_ seems most desirable. And this is\r\nespecially the case since, like the epipharynx, it is morphologically a\r\nmedian structure, and while the epipharynx forms the soft, sensitive\r\nroof of the mouth, or pharynx; its opposite, the hypopharynx, rises as a\r\nfold from the floor of the mouth, forming in its most generalized\r\ncondition a specialized fold of the buccal integument. In certain cases,\r\nas in the honey-bee, the very long slender “tongue” or hypopharynx is\r\nevidently, as in the case of the epipharynx, a highly sensitive armature\r\nof the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn all insects this organ—whether forming a soft, tongue-like, anterior\r\nportion or fold of the labium, and “continuous with the lower wall of\r\nthe pharynx,” or a hard, piercing, awl-like appendage (fleas and flies),\r\nor a long, slender, hairy or setose, trough-like structure like the\r\n“tongue” of the honey-bee—has a definite location at the end and on the\r\nupper side of the labium, and serves to receive at its base the external\r\nopening of the salivary duct.\r\n\r\nThe hypopharynx, as well shown in its lingua condition in Orthoptera, is\r\ncontinuous with and forms the anterior part or fold of the base of the\r\ncoalesced second maxillæ. It does not seem to be paired, or to represent\r\na pair of appendages.\r\n\r\nOpinion regarding the homology of this unpaired piercing organ is by no\r\nmeans settled, and while there is a general agreement as to the nature\r\nof the paired mouth-parts, recent observers differ very much as to the\r\nmorphology of the organ in question.\r\n\r\nIt is the langue or _lingua_ of Savigny (1816), the _ligula_ of Kirby\r\nand Spence (1828), the _langue ou languette_ (_lancette médiane du\r\nsuçoir_) of Dugès (1832), the _lingua_ of Westwood (Class, ins., ii, p.\r\n489, 1840), “the unpaired median piercing organ” (“the analogon of the\r\nepipharynx of Diptera”) of Karsten (1864), the “tongue” of Taschenberg\r\n(1880).\r\n\r\nThe name _hypopharynx_ was first proposed by Savigny in 1816, who, after\r\nnaming the membranous plate which has for its base the upper side of the\r\npharynx, the _epipharynx_, remarks: “Dans quelques genres, notamment\r\ndans les Eucères, le bord inférieur de ce même pharynx donne naissance à\r\nun autre appendice plus solide que le précédent, et qui s’emboîte avec\r\nlui. Je donnerai à ce dernier le nom de _langue_ ou d’_hypopharynx_.\r\nVoilà donc la bouche des Hyménoptères composée de quatre organes\r\nimpaires, sans y comprendre la ganache ou le menton; savoir, la lèvre\r\nsupérieure, l’épipharynx, l’hypopharynx, et la lèvre inférieure, et de\r\ndeux organes paires, les mandibules et les mâchoires.”\r\n\r\nAs stated by Dimmock: “The hypopharynx is usually present in Diptera\r\n(according to Menzbier absent in Sargus), and contains a tube, opening\r\nby a channel on its upper surface; this channel extends back, more or\r\nless, from the tip, and is the outlet for the salivary secretion. The\r\ntip of the hypopharynx may be naked and used as a lance (Hæmatopota,\r\naccording to Menzbier), or may be hairy (Musca). The upper side of the\r\nbase of the hypopharynx is continuous with the lower wall of the\r\npharynx; its under surface may entirely coalesce with the labium (Culex,\r\nmale), may join the labium more or less, anterior to the month (Musca),\r\nor, if either mandibles or maxillæ are present, its base may join them\r\n(Culex, female).” (p. 43.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—Section of head of _Machilis maritima_: _hyp_, hypopharynx;\r\n    _lbr_, labrum; _t_, tentorium; _ph_, room in which the mandibles\r\n    move on each other; _p_, paraglossa; _mx_, labium; _sd_, salivary\r\n    duct; _s.gl_, salivary gland. _oe_, œsophagus.—After Oudemans.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly describe the lingua, first of the mandibulate or\r\nbiting insects, and then its specialized form, the hypopharynx of the\r\nhaustellate and lapping insects.\r\n\r\nThe lingua (hypopharynx) exists in perhaps its most generalized\r\ncondition in the Thysanura (Fig. 69), where it forms a soft projection,\r\nhaving the same relations as in Anabrus and other Orthoptera.[17]\r\n\r\nIn the cockroach (Fig. 70), as stated by Miall and Denny, the lingua is\r\na chitinous fold of the oral integument situated in front of the labium,\r\nand lying in the cavity of the mouth. The common duct of the salivary\r\nglands enters the lingua, and opens on its hinder surface. The lingua is\r\nsupported by a chitinous skeleton (Figs. 70, _B_; 82, _shp_). “The thin\r\nchitinous surface of the lingua is hairy, like other parts of the mouth,\r\nand stiffened by special chitinous rods or bands.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—Hypopharynx of _Periplaneta orientalis_; the arrow points out\r\n    of the opening of the salivary duct: _A_, origin of salivary duct.\r\n    _B_, side view. _C_, front view.—After Miall and Denny.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Acrydiidæ (_Melanoplus femur-rubrum_) the tongue is a large,\r\nmembranous, partly hollow expansion of the base of the labium. It may be\r\nexposed by depressing the end of the labium, when the opening of the\r\nsalivary duct may be seen at the bottom or end of the space or gap\r\nbetween the hinder base of the tongue, and the inner anterior base of\r\nthe labium, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 70. It is somewhat pyriform,\r\nslightly keeled above, and bearing fine stiff bristles, which, as they\r\npoint more or less inwards, probably aid in retaining the food within\r\nthe mouth. The base of the tongue is narrow, and extends back to near\r\nthe pharynx, there being on the floor of the mouth, behind the tongue,\r\ntwo oblique, slight ridges, covered with stiff, golden-yellow hairs,\r\nlike those on the tongue. The opening of the salivary duct is situated\r\non the under or hinder side of the hypopharynx, between it and the base\r\nof the labium, the base of the former being cleft; the hollow thus\r\nformed is situated over the opening, and forms the salivary receptacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.—Section through the anterior part of the head of Anabrus (the\r\n    mandibles removed), showing the relations of the hypopharynx (_hyp_)\r\n    to the opening of the salivary duct (_sd_): _g_, galea; _l_,\r\n    lacinia; _mt_, mentum; _oe_, œsophagus; _lbr_, labrum; _cl_,\r\n    clypeus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Locustidæ (Anabrus, Fig. 71) the tongue (hypopharynx) is a broad,\r\nsomewhat flattened lobe arising from the upper part of the base of the\r\nmentum and behind the palpifer. This lobe is cavernous underneath, the\r\nhollow being the salivary receptacle (_sr_); the latter is situated over\r\nthe opening of the salivary duct, which is placed between the base of\r\nboth the hypopharynx and the labium. The salivary fluid apparently has\r\nto pass up and around on each side of the hypopharynx in order to mix\r\nwith the food.\r\n\r\nThese relations in the Orthoptera are also the same in the Perlidæ,\r\nwhere the hypopharynx is well developed, forming an unusually large\r\ntongue-like mass, nearly filling the buccal cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—Lingua of a May-fly, _Heptagenia longicauda_, ×16: _m_,\r\n    central; _l_, lateral pieces.—After Vayssière from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Odonata the lingua is a small, rounded lobe, as also in the\r\nEphemeridæ; in the nymph, however, of Heptagenia (Fig. 72) it is highly\r\ndeveloped, according to Vayssière, who seems inclined to regard it as\r\nrepresenting a pair of appendages. The tongue in Hemiptera is said by\r\nLéon to be present in _Benacus griseus_ (Say) and to correspond to the\r\nsubgalea of Brullé or hypodactyle of Audouin (Fig. 73), but this appears\r\nto correspond to the labium proper, rather than a true lingua, the\r\nlatter not being differentiated in this order. In the Coleoptera the\r\nlingua is rather small. In beetles, as Anopthalmus (Fig. 74), it forms a\r\nsetose lobe; and a well-developed nerve, the lingual nerve, passes to\r\nit, dividing at the end into several branches (_n-l_). In Sialis the\r\nlingua is short, much less developed than usual, being rounded, and\r\nbears on the edge what appear to be numerous taste-hairs, like those on\r\nthe ends of the maxillary and labial palpi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—_A_, labium of _Zaitha anura_. _B_, of _Z. margineguttata_.\r\n    _C_, of _Gerris najas_: _mt_, mentum; _lp_, labial palpi; _sg_,\r\n    subgalea; _l_, lacinia (= intermaxillare and præmaxillare of\r\n    Brullé); _g_, galea.—After Léon.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the adult Panorpidæ the lingua is a minute, simple lobe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.—Section through head of a carabid, _Anopthalmus telkampfii_:\r\n    _br_, brain; _f. g_, frontal ganglion; _soe_, subœsophageal\r\n    ganglion; _co_, commissure; _n. l_, nerve sending branches to the\r\n    lingua (_l_); _mn_, maxillary nerve; _mx_, 1st maxilla; _mm_,\r\n    maxillary muscle; _mx′_, 2d maxilla; _mt_, muscle of mentum; _le_,\r\n    elevator muscle of the œsophagus; _l_ of the clypeus, and a third\r\n    beyond raising the labrum (_lbr_); _eph_, epipharynx; _g_, _g_,\r\n    salivary glands above; _g_^2, lingual gland below the œsophagus\r\n    (_oe_); _m_, mouth; _pv_, proventriculus; _md_, mandible. _A_,\r\n    section passing through lingual gland (_g_^2).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the larval Trichoptera the spinneret is well developed, and in\r\nstructure substantially like that of caterpillars, and it is plainly the\r\nhomologue of the hypopharynx, receiving as it does the end of the\r\nsilk-duct.\r\n\r\nIn the adult Trichoptera the hypopharynx is a very large, tongue-like,\r\nfleshy outgrowth, and is, both in situation and structure, since it\r\ncontains the opening of the silk-duct, exactly homologous with the\r\nhypopharynx of insects of other orders, being somewhat intermediate\r\nbetween the fleshy tongue or lingua of the mandibulate insects,\r\nespecially the Neuroptera, and the hypopharynx of the bees (Fig. 86).\r\nLucas describes and figures it under the name of “haustellum,” but does\r\nnot homologize it with the hypopharynx. The caddis-flies have been\r\nobserved to drink water and take in both fluid and fine particles of\r\nsolid food, and to use the haustellum for this purpose, the end being\r\nprovided with minute sense-organs like those on the first maxillary\r\nlacinia, and possibly of a gustatory nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 75.—Head of _Anabolia furcata_: _A_, front view, showing the\r\n    labrum removed. _B_, side view; _ant_, antenna; _oc_, ocellus; _ol_,\r\n    labrum; _gh_, articulatory process; _cmx__{1}, cardo; _stmx__{1},\r\n    stipes; _lemx__{1}, outer lobe (galea); _ptmx__{1}, palpus of 1st\r\n    maxilla; _pl_, palpus of 2d maxilla; _ha_, haustellum; _so_,\r\n    gustatory pits; _spr_, opening of salivary duct; _chsp_, chitinous\r\n    hook of the clasp; _spr_, furrow or gutter of the haustellum.—After\r\n    Lucas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.—Hypopharynx of _Eriocephala calthella_: _lig_, ligula, its\r\n    membranous hinder edge; _lig′_, anterior horny edge of the\r\n    ligula-tube opening outwards; _hp_, contour of the hypopharynx;\r\n    _mi_, mala interior (lacinia); _me_, mala exterior (galea), of\r\n    second maxilla; _mx′ p_, labial palpus.—After Walter.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe spinneret of the larvæ of Lepidoptera is evidently the homologue of\r\nthe hypopharynx of insects of other orders. It will be seen that the\r\nhomology of the different parts is identical, the common duct of the\r\nsilk-glands opening at the end of the hypopharynx, which here forms a\r\ncomplete tube or proboscis extending beyond the end of the labium, in\r\nadaptation to its use as a spinning organ.\r\n\r\nWalter refers to Burgess’s discovery of a hypopharynx in _Danais\r\narchippus_, remarking that this organ in the adult Eriocephalidæ (Fig.\r\n76) exhibits a great similarity to the relations observable in the lower\r\ninsects, adding:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.— Labium of _Micropteryx anderschella_ seen from within (the\r\n    labial palpi (_mx.′ p_) removed to their basal joint).

As he states:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78.—Hypopharynx (_hph_) of Danais: _cl_, clypeus; _sd_, salivary\r\n    duct; _m_, labial palp muscles; _fm_, frontal muscle; _ph_, pharynx;\r\n    _cor_, cornea.—After Burgess.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“A portion of the inner surface of the tube-like ligula is covered by a\r\nfurrow-like band which, close to the inner side, is coalesced with it,\r\nand in position, shape, as well as its appendages or teeth on the edge,\r\nmay be regarded as nothing else than the hypopharynx.”\r\n\r\nA hypopharynx is also present in the highest Lepidoptera, Burgess having\r\ndetected it in _Danais archippus_. He states that the hypopharynx forms\r\nthe floor of the pharyngeal cavity; “it is convex on each side of a\r\nmedian furrow (Fig. 78, _hph_) and somewhat resembles in shape the human\r\nbreast. The convex areas are dotted over with little papillæ, which\r\npossibly may be taste-organs.”\r\n\r\nAs a piercing organ the hypopharynx reaches its greatest development in\r\nthe Siphonaptera and Diptera, where the chitinous parts are greatly\r\nhypertrophied, the fleshy tongue-like portion so developed in the\r\nmandibulate orders being greatly reduced. The chitinous parts are alike\r\non each side of the median organ, being bilaterally symmetrical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 79.—_A_, hypopharynx of _Pulex canis_: _x_, basal portion\r\n    situated within the head; _s. d_, common duct of the four\r\n    bladder-shaped salivary glands; _s. d′_, opening of the tubular\r\n    salivary glands into the throat. _B_, end of the hypopharynx,\r\n    showing the gutter-like structure and teeth at the end.—After\r\n    Landois.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 80.—Beak of Vermipsylla: _hyp_, hypopharynx.—After Wagner.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the fleas the hypopharynx is a large, slender, unpaired, long,\r\nchitinous trough, as long as the mandibles, and toothed at the end.\r\nFigures 79 and 80 show its relations to the other parts of the mouth; in\r\nFig. 79, _x_, is seen where the salivary duct opens into the pharynx.\r\nAlthough this organ is not unanimously referred to the hypopharynx, yet\r\nfrom the description of Landois and others, it is evident that this\r\nstructure does not correspond to the labrum or epipharynx, but belongs\r\nto or arises from the floor of the mouth, and, being in close relation\r\nto the labium, and also receiving the salivary duct, must be a true\r\nhypopharynx.\r\n\r\nIn the Diptera the hypopharynx reaches its highest development as a\r\nlarge, stout, awl-like structure.\r\n\r\nMeinert, in his detailed and elaborately illustrated work, Trophi\r\nDipterorum (1881), has made an advance on our knowledge of the\r\nhypopharynx and its homologies, both by his evidently faithful\r\ndescriptions and dissections, and by his admirably clear figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 81.—_Culex pipiens_, section of head: _oe_ œsophagus; _sm_, upper\r\n    muscle, _lm_, lower muscle of the œsophagus; _ph_, pharynx; _rm_,\r\n    retractor muscle of the receptacle (_r_) of the salivary duct\r\n    (_s.d_); _lbr_, labrum; _ep_, left style of the epipharynx; _f_,\r\n    part of front of head.—After Meinert.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 82.—Pharynx and hypopharynx of _Simulium fuscipes_: _lph_, lower\r\n    lamina of the pharynx; _p_, the salivary duct (_s.d_) perforating\r\n    the pharynx; _o_, orifice of the duct; _shp_, styles of the\r\n    hypopharynx; _mph_, membranous edge of the hypopharynx; _m_,\r\n    protractor muscle of the pharynx; _gp_, gustatory papillæ.—After\r\n    Meinert.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “The hypopharynx, a continuation of the lower edge (_lamina_) of the\r\n  pharynx, most generally free, more or less produced, acute\r\n  anteriorly, forms with the labrum the tube of the pump (_antliæ_).\r\n  (The hypopharynx when obsolete, or coalesced with the canal of the\r\n  proboscis, is the _theca_; in such a case the siphon or tube is\r\n  formed by the theca and labrum.) Meanwhile the hypopharynx, the\r\n  largest of all the trophi (_omnium trophorum maximus_), constitutes\r\n  the chief piercing organ (_telum_) of Diptera. The hypopharynx is\r\n  moved by protractor, most generally quite or very powerful, and by\r\n  retractor muscles.\r\n\r\n  “The efferent duct of the thoracic salivary glands (_ductus\r\n  salivalis_) perforates the hypopharynx, more or less near the base,\r\n  that the saliva may be ejected through the canal into the wound, or\r\n  that it may be conducted along the labella. Very rarely the salivary\r\n  duct, perforating the hypopharynx, is continued in the shape of a\r\n  free, very slender tube.\r\n\r\n  “The salivary duct behind the base of the hypopharynx forms the\r\n  receptacle or _receptaculum_, provided with retractor and levator\r\n  muscles.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 83.—Labrum-epipharynx (_lbr_ and _eph_) and hypopharynx (_hyp_)\r\n    of _Tabanus brominus_: _oe_, posterior cylindrical portion of the\r\n    œsophagus; _a_, anterior swollen portion of the same; _ph_, pharynx;\r\n    _ph.m_, pharyngeal muscle; _p.ph_, protractor muscle of the pharynx;\r\n    _r.oe_, retractor muscle of the œsophagus; _r.ph_, retractor muscle\r\n    of the pharynx; _f.oe_, flexor muscle of the pharynx; _t.oe_,\r\n    twisting muscle of the œsophagus; _s.r_, receptacle of the salivary\r\n    duct; _l_, its elevator muscle; _s_, its retractor muscle; _cl_,\r\n    clypeus.—After Meinert.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—Œsophagus (_oe_), pharynx (_ph_) with epipharynx and labrum\r\n    (_lbr_) of _Asilus atricapillus_: _m_, _ph_, pharyngeal muscle;\r\n    _sr_, salivary receptacle; _t_, twisting; _r_, _l′r_, retractor\r\n    muscles; other lettering as in Fig. 83.—After Meinert.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been carefully studied by Meinert in a species of Culex (Fig.\r\n81), Simulium (Fig. 82), Tabanus (Fig. 83), and in Asilus (Fig. 84),\r\nwhere it is seen to attain enormous proportions. In the Hymenoptera,\r\nthis organ in its most specialized condition is a trough-like rod,\r\nadapted for lapping nectar (Fig. 85, 86, _hyp_). The tongue or\r\nhypopharynx of the honey-bee has been elaborately described by Cheshire\r\nin his Bees and Bee Keeping.[18] He calls it the tongue or ligula. It is\r\nsituated in a tube formed by the maxillæ and labial palpi, and can be\r\npartially retracted into the mentum. He states that it can move up and\r\ndown in the tube thus formed, and then describes it as covered by a\r\nhairy sheath, its great elasticity being due to a rod running through\r\nits centre enabling it to be used as a lapping tongue. The sheath\r\n\r\n  “passes round the tongue to the back, where its edges do not meet,\r\n  but are continuous with a very thin plaited membrane (_G_, _pm_)\r\n  covered with minute hairs. This membrane, after passing towards the\r\n  sides of the tongue, returns to the angle of the nucleus, or rod,\r\n  over the under surface of which it is probably continued. The rod\r\n  passes through the tongue from end to end, gradually tapering\r\n  towards its extremity, and is best studied in the queen, where I\r\n  trace many nerve threads and cells. It is undoubtedly endowed with\r\n  voluntary movement, and must be partly muscular, although I have\r\n  failed completely in getting any evidence of striation. The rod on\r\n  the underside has a gutter, or trough-like hollow (_cd_, the central\r\n  duct) which is formed into a pseudotube (false tube) by\r\n  intercrossing of black hairs. It will also be seen that, by the\r\n  posterior meeting of the sheath, the space between the folded\r\n  membrane (_G_, _sd_) becomes two pseudotubes of larger size, which I\r\n  shall call the side ducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—Head of honey bee, worker: _a_, antenna; _g_, epipharynx;\r\n    _m_, mandible; _mx_, maxilla; _mxp_, maxillary palpus; _pg_,\r\n    paraglossa; _lp_, labial palpus; _l_, hypopharynx; _b_, its\r\n    spoon.—After Cheshire; from Bull. Div. Ent. U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “These central and side ducts run down to that part of the tongue\r\n  where the spoon, or bouton (_K_, Fig. 86) is placed. This is\r\n  provided with very delicate split hairs (_b_, Fig. 86) capable of\r\n  brushing up the most minute quantity of nectar, which by capillarity\r\n  is at once transferred by the gathering hairs (which are here\r\n  numerous, long, and thin) to two side groove-like forms at the back\r\n  of the bouton, and which are really the opened-out extremity of the\r\n  centre and side ducts, assuming, immediately above the bouton, the\r\n  form seen in _F_, Fig. 86. The central duct, which is only from\r\n  1⁄600 inch to 1⁄1000 inch in diameter, because of its smaller size,\r\n  and so greater capillary attraction, receives the nectar, if\r\n  insufficient in quantity to fill the side ducts. But good\r\n  honey-yielding plants would bring both centre and side ducts into\r\n  requisition. The nectar is sucked up until it reaches the paraglossæ\r\n  (_pa_, _B_, Fig. 86), which are plate-like in front, but membranous\r\n  extensions, like small aprons, behind; and by these the nectar\r\n  reaches the front of the tongue, to be swallowed as before\r\n  described.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 86.—Tongue or ligula of the honey bee: _A_, under side of the\r\n    tongue; _lp_, labial palpi; _r_, _r_, rod; _p_, pouch; _sh_, sheath;\r\n    _gh_, gathering hairs; _b_, bouton or spoon. _B_, under lip or\r\n    labium, with appendages, partly dissected; _l_, lora or submentum;\r\n    _a_, _a_, retractor linguæ longus; _sd_, salivary duct; _rb_ and\r\n    _b_, retractor linguæ biceps; _mx_, maxillæ; _lp_, labial palpi;\r\n    _pa_, paraglossa; _gr_, feeding groove; _sh_, sheath of ligula. _C_,\r\n    _D_, _E_, sections of ligula; _hp_, hyaline plate of maxilla; _h_,\r\n    hairs acting as stops; _mx_, maxilla; _lp_, labial palpi; _sd_, side\r\n    duct. _F_, cross-section of extremity of tongue near the “spoon”;\r\n    _th_, tactile hairs; _r_, rod; _n_, nucleus; _gh_, gathering hairs.\r\n    _G_, cross-section of tongue without gathering hairs, × 400 times;\r\n    _sh_, sheath; _b_, blood space; _t_, trachea: _ng_, gustatory nerve;\r\n    _cd_, central duct; _sd_, lateral duct; _pm_, plaited membrane. _H_,\r\n    same as _G_, but magnified two hundred times, and with _pm_, plaited\r\n    membrane, turned outwards; _h_, closing hairs; _lp_, labial palpi;\r\n    _b_, blood; _n_, nucleus; _r_, rod; _h_, closing hairs. _I_, small\r\n    portion of the sheath; lettering as before. _K_, extremity of the\r\n    tongue, with spoon; _b_, branching hairs for gathering.—After\r\n    Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\nCheshire then settles the question which has been in dispute since the\r\ntime of Swammerdam, whether the bee’s tongue is solid or tubular. He\r\nagrees with Wolff that the duct is a trough and not a tube, and proves\r\nit by a satisfactory experiment. He remarks:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 87.—Longitudinal section through the head of the honey bee, ♀,\r\n    just outside of right antenna: _ant_, antenna with three muscles\r\n    attached to _mes_, mesocephalic pillar; _cl_, clypeus; _lbr_,\r\n    labrum; 1, chyle-gland (system no. 1, of Siebold); _o_, opening of\r\n    the same; _oc_, ocellus; _br_, brain; _n_, neck; _th_, thorax; _oe_,\r\n    œsophagus; _s.d_^2, _s.d_^3, common salivary ducts of systems 2 and\r\n    3; _v_, salivary valve; _c_, cardo; _ph_, pharynx; _mx′_, labium;\r\n    _mx.′p_, labial palpi; _mt_, mentum; _mx_, maxilla; _hyp_,\r\n    hypopharynx; _s_, bouton.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Bees have the power, by driving blood into the tongue, of forcing\r\n  the rod out from the sheath, and distending the wrinkled membrane so\r\n  that in section it appears as at _H_, Fig. 86, the membrane assuming\r\n  the form of a pouch, given in full length at _A_. It will be seen at\r\n  once that this disposition of parts abolishes the side ducts, but\r\n  brings the central duct to the external surface. The object of this\r\n  curious capability on the part of the bee is, in my opinion, to\r\n  permit of cleaning away any pollen grains, or other impediment that\r\n  may collect in the side ducts. The membrane is greasy in nature, and\r\n  substances or fluids can be removed from it as easily as water from\r\n  polished metal. If, now, the sides of a needle, previously dipped\r\n  into clove oil in which rosanilin (magenta) has been dissolved, so\r\n  as to stain it strongly red, be touched on the centre of the rod,\r\n  the oil immediately enters, and passes rapidly upwards and\r\n  downwards, filling the trough.”\r\n\r\n  =Does the hypopharynx represent a distinct segment?=—The facts which\r\n  suggest that the hypopharynx may possibly represent a highly\r\n  modified pair of appendages, arising from a distinct intermaxillary\r\n  segment, are these: Heymons plainly shows that, in the embryo of\r\n  Lepisma, the hypopharynx originates as a transverse segment-like\r\n  fold in front of the 2d maxillary segment, and larger than it, and\r\n  though he does not mention it in his text, it appears like the\r\n  rudiment of a distinct segment; the hypopharynx of Ephemeridæ;\r\n  arises and remains separate in the nymph from the labium (see\r\n  Heymons’ Fig. 29, and there are two lateral projections; see also\r\n  Fig. 72, and Vayssiere’s view that it may represent a pair of\r\n  appendages; Kolbe also regards it as representing a third pair of\r\n  maxillæ, his endolabium, p. 213). Though what is called an unpaired\r\n  organ, it is composed of, or supported by, two bilaterally\r\n  symmetrical styles, both in Myriopods (Fig. 6, labiella, _stil_) and\r\n  in insects (Fig. 77, etc.). On the other hand, in the embryo of\r\n  pterygote insects, an intermaxillary segment has not been yet\r\n  detected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           LITERATURE OF THE MOUTH-PARTS OR BUCCAL APPENDAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _a._ General\r\n\r\n  =Savigny, Jules-César.= Mémoires sur les animaux sans vertèbres.\r\n    1^{re} Part.

In the\r\nprothorax these pieces are not subdivided, except the pleural; in such\r\ncase the tergum is called the _pronotum_. The prothorax is very large in\r\nthe Orthoptera and other generalized forms, as also in the Coleoptera,\r\nbut small and reduced in the Diptera and Hymenoptera. In the winged\r\nforms the tergum of the mesothorax is differentiated into four pieces or\r\nplates (sclerites). These pieces were named by Audouin, passing from\r\nbefore backwards, the _præscutum_, _scutum_, _scutellum_, and\r\n_postscutellum_. In the nymph stage and in the wingless adults of\r\ninsects such as the Mallophaga, the true lice, the wingless Diptera,\r\nants, etc., these parts by disuse and loss of the wings are not\r\ndifferentiated. It is therefore apparent that their development depends\r\non that of the muscles of flight, of which they form the base of\r\nattachment. The scutum is invariably present, as is the scutellum. The\r\nformer in nearly all insects constitutes the larger part of the tergum,\r\nwhile the latter is, as its name implies, the small shield-shaped piece\r\ndirectly behind the scutum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 90.—Thorax of _Telea polyphemus_, side view, pronotum not\r\n    represented: _em_, epimerum of prothorax, the narrow piece above\r\n    being the prothoracic episternum; _ms_, mesoscutum; _scm_,\r\n    mesoscutellum; _ms″_, metascutum; _scm‴_, metascutellum; _pt_, a\r\n    supplementary piece near the insertion of tegulæ; _w_, pieces\r\n    situated at the insertion of the wings, and surrounded by membrane;\r\n    _epm″_, episternum of the mesothorax; _em″_, epimerum of the same;\r\n    _epm‴_, episternum of the metathorax; _em‴_ epimerum of the same,\r\n    divided into two pieces; _c′_, _c″_, _c‴_, coxæ; _te′_, _te″_,\r\n    _te‴_, trochantines; _tr_, _tr_, _tr_, trochanters. _A_, tergal view\r\n    of the mesothorax of the same; _prm_, præscutum; _ms_, scutum;\r\n    _scm_, scutellum; _ptm_, postscutellum; _t_, tegula.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe præscutum and postscutellum are usually minute and crowded down out\r\nof sight between the opposing segments. As seen in Fig. 90, the\r\npræscutum of most moths (Telea) is a small rounded piece, bent\r\nvertically down so as not to be seen from above. In Polystœchotes and\r\nalso in Hepialus the præscutum is large, well-developed, triangular, and\r\nwedged in between the two halves of the scutum. The postscutellum is\r\nstill smaller, usually forming a transverse ridge, and is rarely used in\r\ntaxonomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 91.—Thorax of the house-fly: _prn_, pronotum; _prsc_, præscutum;\r\n    _sc′_, mesoscutum; _sct′_, mesoscutellum; _psct′_, postscutellum;\r\n    _al_, insertion of squama, extending to the insertion of the wings,\r\n    which have been removed; _msphr_, mesophragma; _h_, balancer\r\n    (halter); _pt_, tegula; _mtn_, metanotum; _epis_, _epis′_, _epis″_,\r\n    episternum of pro-, meso-, and metathorax; _epm′_, _epm″_, meso- and\r\n    meta-epimerum; _st′_, _st″_, meso- and metasternum; _cx′_, _cx″_,\r\n    _cx‴_, coxæ; _tr′_, _tr″_, _tr‴_, trochanters of the three pairs of\r\n    legs; _sp′_, _sp″_, _sp‴_, _sp‴′_, _sp‴″_, first to fifth spiracles;\r\n    _tg′_, _tg″_, tergites of first and second abdominal segments; _u′_,\r\n    _u″_, urites.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe metathorax is usually smaller and shorter than the mesothorax, being\r\nproportioned to the size of the wings. In certain Neuroptera and in\r\nHepialidæ and some tineoid moths, where the hind wings are nearly as\r\nlarge as those of the anterior pair, the metathorax is more than half or\r\nnearly two-thirds as large as the mesothorax. In Hepialidæ the præscutum\r\nis large and distinct, while the scutum is divided into two widely\r\nseparated pieces. The postscutellum is nearly or quite obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe pleurum in each of the three thoracic segments is divided into two\r\npieces; the one in front is called the _episternum_, since it rests upon\r\nthe sternum; the other is the _epimerum_. To these pieces, with the\r\nsternum in part, the legs are articulated (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\nBetween the episterna is situated the breastplate or _sternum_, which is\r\nvery large in the more primitive forms, as the Orthoptera, and is small\r\nin the Diptera and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 92.—Prothorax of _Geometra papilionaria_: _n_, notum; _p_,\r\n    pleura; _st_, sternum; _pt_, patagia; _m_, membrane; _f_, femur;\r\n    _h_, a hook bent backwards and beneath, and connecting the pro- with\r\n    the mesothorax.—After Cholodkowsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe episterna and epimera are in certain groups, Neuroptera, etc.,\r\nfurther subdivided each into two pieces (Fig. 102). The smaller pieces,\r\nhinging upon each other and forming the attachments of the muscles of\r\nflight, differ much in shape and size in insects of different orders.\r\nThe difference in shape and degree of differentiation of these parts of\r\nthe thorax is mentioned and illustrated under each order, and reference\r\nto the figures will obviate pages of tedious description. A glance,\r\nhowever, at the thorax of a moth, fly, or bee, where these numerous\r\npieces are agglutinated into a globular mass, will show that the\r\nspherical shape of the thorax in these insects is due to the enlargement\r\nof one part at the expense of another; the prothoracic and metathoracic\r\nsegments being more or less atrophied, while the mesothorax is greatly\r\nenlarged to support the powerful muscles of flight, the fore wings being\r\nmuch larger than those appended to the metathorax. In the Diptera, whose\r\nhinder pair of wings are reduced to the condition of halteres, the\r\nreduction of the metathorax as well as prothorax is especially marked\r\n(Fig. 91).\r\n\r\n=The patagia.=—On each side of the pronotum of Lepidoptera are two\r\ntransversely oval, movable, concavo-convex, erectile plates, called\r\n_patagia_ (Fig. 92). On cutting those of a dry Catocala in two, they\r\nwill be seen to be hollow. Cholodkowsky[19] states that they are filled\r\nwith blood and tracheal branches; and he went so far as to regard them\r\nas rudimentary prothoracic wings, in which view he was corrected by\r\nHaase,[20] who compares them with the tegulæ, regarding them also as\r\nsecondary or accessory structures.\r\n\r\n=The tegulæ.=—On the mesothorax are the _tegulæ_ of Kirby (_pterygodes_\r\nof Latreille, _paraptera_ of McLeay, _hypoptère_ or _squamule_), which\r\ncover the base of the fore wings, and are especially developed in the\r\nLepidoptera (Fig. 90, _A_, _t_) and in certain Hymenoptera (Fig. 95,\r\n_c_).\r\n\r\nThe external opening of the spiracles just under the fore wings, is\r\nsituated in a little plate called by Audouin the _peritreme_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.—Transformation of the bumble bee, Bombus, showing the\r\n    transfer of the 1st abdominal larval segment (_c_) to the thorax,\r\n    forming the propodeum of the pupa (_D_) and imago; _n_, spiracle of\r\n    the propodeum. _A_, larva; _a_, head; _b_, 1st thoracic; _c_, 1st\r\n    abdominal segment. _B_, semipupa; _g_, antenna; _h_, maxillæ; _i_,\r\n    1st; _j_, 2d leg; _k_, mesoscutum; _l_, mesoscutellum; _m_,\r\n    metathorax; _d_, urite (sternite of abdomen); _e_, pleurite; _f_,\r\n    tergite; _o_, ovipositor; _r_, lingua; _q_, maxilla.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the higher or aculeate Hymenoptera, besides the three segments\r\nnormally composing the thorax, the basal abdominal segment is during the\r\nchange from the larva to the pupa transferred to this region, making\r\nfour segments. This first abdominal is called “the median segment”\r\n(Figs. 93–95). In such a case the term _alitrunk_ has been applied to\r\nthis region, _i.e._ the thorax, as thus constituted. Latreille wrongly\r\nstated that in the Diptera the first abdominal segment also entered into\r\nthe composition of the thorax; but Brauer has fully disproved that view,\r\nas may be seen by an examination of his sketches which we have copied\r\n(Fig. 94).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 94.—7, 8, thorax of _Tipula gigantea_; 9, of Leptis; 10, thorax\r\n    of _Tabanus bromius_ after the removal of the abdomen, in order to\r\n    bring into view the inner mesophragma (_f_), and to show the\r\n    extension of the metathorax _g_ and _g′_; _tr_, trochanter; 11, hind\r\n    end of the mesothorax, the entire metathorax, and the 1st and 2d\r\n    abdominal segments of _Volucella zonaria_, seen from the side.

Those passing up from the sternum form the _entothorax_ of\r\nAudouin, and the process of each thoracic segment is called respectively\r\nthe _antefurca_, _medifurca_, and _postfurca_. In the Orthoptera\r\n(Caloptenus and Anabrus), the antefurca is large, thin, flattened,\r\ndirected forward, and bounds each side of the prothoracic ganglion. In\r\nthe Coleoptera two plates (Fig. 97, 2._s_) arise from the inside of the\r\nsternum and “form a collar or leave a circular hole between them for the\r\npassage of the nervous cord” (Newport). The medifurca is a pair of flat\r\nprocesses which diverge and bridge the commissure, while the postfurca\r\nis situated under the commissure. In beetles (Dyticus) Newport states\r\nthat it is expanded into two broad plates, to which the muscles of the\r\nposterior legs are attached. Graber also notices in the mole cricket\r\nbetween the apodemes of the meso- and metathorax, a flattened spine\r\n(Fig. 98, _do_) with two perforations through which pass the commissures\r\nconnecting the ganglia. Besides these processes there are large, thin,\r\nlongitudinal partitions passing down from the tergum (or dorsum), called\r\n_phragmas_; they are most developed in those insects which fly best,\r\n_i.e._ in Coleoptera (Figs. 97–101), Lepidoptera, Diptera, and\r\nHymenoptera, none being developed in the prothorax. (The term _phragma_\r\nhas also been applied to a partition formed by the inflexed hinder edge\r\nof this segment, and is present only in those insects in which the\r\nprothorax is movable.—Century Dictionary.) All these ingrowths may be in\r\ngeneral termed _apodemes_. There are similar structures in Crustacea and\r\nalso in Limulus; but Sharp restricts this term to minute projections in\r\nbeetles (Goliathus) situated at the sides of the thorax near the wings.\r\n(Insecta, p. 103, Fig. 57.) The internal processes arising from the\r\nsternal region have been called _endosternites_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 101.—Internal skeleton of _Lucanus cervus_, ♂, head: _A_,\r\n    antenna; _f_, mandible; _d_, mentum; 2, 4, tendons of mandible; _f_,\r\n    _u_, _t_, parts of the tentorium; 3 _e_, labial muscles. Thorax: 2,\r\n    prothorax; 3, 4, meso- and metathorax fused solidly together; 3 _r_,\r\n    acetabulum of prothorax, into which the coxa is inserted; 2 _s_,\r\n    sternum; 3_t_, acetabulum of mesothorax, 4_r_, of metathorax; 3 _s_,\r\n    mesothoracic sternum fused with that of the metathorax (4_g_); 4\r\n    _s_, apodeme.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The acetabula.=—These are the cavities in which the legs are inserted.\r\nThey are situated on each side of the posterior part of the sternum, in\r\neach of the thoracic segments. They are, in general, formed by an\r\napproximation of the sternum and epimerum, and sometimes, also, of the\r\nepisternum, as in Dyticus (Fig. 97, _A_). This consolidation of parts,\r\nsays Newport, gives an amazing increase of strength to the segments, and\r\nis one of the circumstances which enables the insect to exert an\r\nastonishing degree of muscular power.\r\n\r\n   TABULAR VIEW OF THE SEGMENTS, PIECES, AND APPENDAGES OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n     NAME OF SEGMENT    │  PIECES (SCLERITES)   │      APPENDAGES\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n 1.

They are articulated to the episternum, epimerum, and\r\nsternum, taken together, and consist of five segments. The basal segment\r\nor joint is the _coxa_, situated between the episternum and trochanter.\r\nThe coxa usually has a posterior subdivision or projection, the\r\n_trochantine_; sometimes, as in Mantispa (Fig. 103), the trochantine is\r\nobsolete. We had previously supposed that the trochantine was a separate\r\njoint, but now doubt whether it represents a distinct segment of the\r\nleg, and regard it as only a subdivision of the coxa. It is attached to\r\nthe epimerum, and is best developed in Panorpidæ, Trichoptera, and\r\nLepidoptera. In the Thysanura the trochantine is wanting, and in the\r\ncockroach it merely forms a subdivision of the coxa, its use being to\r\nsupport the latter. The second segment is the trochanter, a more or less\r\nshort spherical joint on which the leg proper turns; in the parasitic\r\ngroups (Ichneumonidæ, etc., Fig. 104) it is usually divided into two\r\npieces, though there are some exceptions. The trochanter is succeeded by\r\nthe _femur_, _tibia_, and _tarsus_, the latter consisting of from one to\r\nfive segments, the normal number being five. Tuffen West believed that\r\nthe pulvillus is the homologue of an additional tarsal joint, “a sixth\r\ntarsal joint.” The last tarsal segment ends in a pair of freely movable\r\nclaws (ungues), which are modified setæ; between the claws is a\r\ncushion-like pad or adhesive lobe, called the _empodium_ or _pulvillus_\r\n(Fig. 105, also variously called _arolium_, _palmula_, _plantula_,\r\n_onychium_, its appendage being called _paronychium_ and also\r\n_pseudonychium_). It is cleft or bilobate in many flies, but in Sargus\r\ntrilobate. All these parts vary greatly in shape and relative size in\r\ninsects of different groups, especially Trichoptera, Lepidoptera,\r\nDiptera, and Hymenoptera. In certain flies (_e.g._ Leptogaster) the\r\nempodium is wanting (Kolbe). By some writers the middle lobe is called\r\nthe empodium and the two others pulvilli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 103.—Side view of meso- and metathorax of _Mantispa brunnea_,\r\n    showing the upper and lower divisions of the epimerum (_s. em′_, _s.\r\n    em″_, _i. em′_, _i. em″_); _s. epis_, _i. epis″_, the same of the\r\n    episternum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 104.—Divided (ditrochous) trochanter of an ichneumon: _cx_, coxa;\r\n    _tr_, the two divisions of the trochanter; _f_, femur.—After Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fore legs are usually directed forward to drag the body along, while\r\nthe middle and hind legs are directed outward and backward to push the\r\nbody onwards. While arachnids walk on the tip ends of their feet,\r\nmyriopods, Thysanura, and all larval insects walk on the ends of the\r\nclaws, but insects generally, especially the adults, are, so to speak,\r\nplantigrade, since they walk on all the tarsal joints. In the aquatic\r\nforms the middle and hind tarsi are more or less flattened, oar-like,\r\nand edged with setæ. In leaping insects, as the locusts and\r\ngrasshoppers, and certain chrysomelids, the hind femora are greatly\r\nswollen owing to the development of the muscles within. The tibia,\r\nbesides bearing large, lateral, external spines, occasionally bears at\r\nthe end one or more spines or spurs called _calcaria_. The fore tibia\r\nalso in ants, etc., bear tactile hairs, and chordotonal organs, as well\r\nas other isolated sense-organs (Janet), and, in grasshoppers, ears.\r\n\r\nIn the Carabidæ the legs are provided with combs for cleaning the\r\nantennæ (Fig. 107), and in the bees and ants these cleansing organs are\r\nmore specialized, the pectinated spine (_calcar_) being opposed by a\r\ntarsal comb (Fig. 106, _d_; for the wax-pincers of bees, see _g_). In\r\ngeneral the insects use their more or less spiny legs for cleansing the\r\nhead, antennæ, palpi, wings, etc., and the adaptations for that end are\r\nthe bristles or spinules on the legs, especially the tibiæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105.—Foot of honey-bee, with the pulvillus in use: _A_, under\r\n    view of foot; _t_, _t_, 3d–5th tarsal joints; _a n_, unguis; _f h_,\r\n    tactile hairs; _p v_, pulvillus; _cr_, curved rod. _B_, side view of\r\n    foot. _C_, central part of sole; _pd_, pad; _cr_, curved rod; _pv_,\r\n    pulvillus unopened.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 106.—Modifications of the legs of different bees. _A_, Apis: _a_,\r\n    wax-pincer and outer view of hind leg; _b_, inner aspect of\r\n    wax-pincer and leg, with the nine pollen-brushes or rows of hairs;\r\n    _c_, compound hairs holding grains of pollen; _d_, anterior leg,\r\n    showing antenna-cleaner; _e_, spur on tibia of middle leg. _B_,\r\n    Melipona: _f_, peculiar group of spines at apex of tibia of hind\r\n    leg; _g_, inner aspect of wax-pincer and first tarsal joint. _C_,\r\n    Bombus: _h_, wax-pincer; _i_, inner view of the same and first\r\n    tarsal joint, all enlarged.—From _Insect Life_, U.

On the other hand, the pedestrian or walking Diptera\r\n(Asilidæ, etc.) “use the legs not for alighting only, but for running,\r\nand all kinds of other work, seizing their prey, carrying it, climbing,\r\ndigging, etc.; their legs are provided not only with spines and\r\nbristles, but with still other appendages, which may be useful, or only\r\nornamental, as secondary sexual characters.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 107.—End of tibia and tarsal joints of Anophthalmus; _c_, comb.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Tenent hairs.=—Projecting from the lower surface of the empodium are\r\nthe numerous “tenent hairs,” or holding hairs, which are modified\r\nglandular setæ swollen at the end and which give out a minute quantity\r\nof a clear adhesive fluid (Figs. 108, 109, 130, 134). In larval insects,\r\nand the adults of certain beetles, Coccidæ, Aphidæ, and Collembola,\r\nwhich have no empodium, there are one or more of these tenent hairs\r\npresent. They enable the insect to adhere to smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 108.—Transverse section through a tarsal joint of Telephorus, a\r\n    beetle: _ch_, cuticula of the upper side; _m_, its matrix; _ch′_,\r\n    the sole; _m′_, its matrix; _h_, adhesive hair; _h′_, tactile hair,\r\n    supplied with a nerve (_n′_), and arising from a main nerve (_n_);\r\n    _n″_, ganglion of a tactile hair; _t_, section of main trachea, from\r\n    which arises a branch (_t′_); _dr_, glands which open into the\r\n    adhesive hairs, and form the sticky secretion; _e_, chitinous\r\n    thickening; _s_, sinew; _b_, membrane dividing the hollow space of\r\n    the tarsal joint into compartments.

The last tarsal joint\r\nis enlarged into the form of an irregular hollow shield. The most\r\ncompletely suctorial feet of insects are those of the anterior pair of\r\nDyticus (Fig. 132). The under side of the three basal joints is fused\r\ntogether and enlarged into a single broad and nearly circular shield,\r\nwhich is convex above and fringed with fine branching hairs, and covered\r\nbeneath with suckers, of which two are exceptionally large; by this\r\napparatus of suckers the male is enabled to adhere to the back of its\r\nmate during copulation. The line branching hairs around the edge prevent\r\nthe water from penetrating and thus destroying the vacuum, “while if the\r\nfemale struggle out of the water, by retaining the fluid for some time\r\naround the sucker, they will in like manner under these altered\r\nconditions equally tend to preserve the effectual contact.” (Tuffen\r\nWest.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 109.—Cross-section through tarsus of a locust: _ch_, cuticula of\r\n    upper side,—_ch′_, _ch″_, _ch‴_, of sole; _ch_, tubulated layer;\r\n    _ch″_, lamellate layer; _ch‴_, inner projections of _ch″_.

See p. 113.—After Dewitz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the saw-flies (Uroceridæ and Tenthredinidæ) and other insects, there\r\nare small membranous oval cushions (_arolia_, Figs. 109 and 131) beneath\r\neach or nearly each tarsal joint.\r\n\r\n  The triunguline larvæ of the Meloidæ are so called from apparently\r\n  having three ungues, but in reality there is only a single claw,\r\n  with a claw-like bristle on each side.\r\n\r\n  =Why do insects have but six legs?=—Embryology shows that the\r\n  ancestors of insects were polypodous, and the question arises to\r\n  what cause is due the process of elimination of legs in the\r\n  ancestors of existing insects, so that at present there are no\r\n  functional legs on the abdomen, these being invariably restricted\r\n  (except in caterpillars) to the thorax, and the number never being\r\n  more than six. It is evident that the number of six legs was fixed\r\n  by heredity in the Thysanura, before the appearance of winged\r\n  insects. We had thought that this restriction of legs to the thorax\r\n  was in part due to the fact that this is the centre of gravity, and\r\n  also because abdominal legs are not necessary in locomotion, since\r\n  the fore legs are used in dragging the insect forwards, while the\r\n  two hinder pairs support and push the body on. Synchronously with\r\n  this elimination by disuse of the abdominal legs, the body became\r\n  shortened, and subdivided into three regions. On the other hand, as\r\n  in caterpillars, with their long bodies, the abdominal legs of the\r\n  embryo persist; or if it be granted that the prop-legs are secondary\r\n  structures, then they were developed in larval life to prop up and\r\n  move the abdominal region.\r\n\r\n  The constancy of the number of six legs is explained by Dahl as\r\n  being in relation to their function as climbing organs. One leg, he\r\n  says, will almost always be perpendicular to the plane when the\r\n  animal is moving up a vertical surface; and, on the other hand, we\r\n  know that three is the smallest number with which stable equilibrium\r\n  is possible; an insect must therefore have twice this number, and\r\n  the great numerical superiority of the class may be associated with\r\n  this mechanical advantage. (This numerical superiority of insects,\r\n  however, seems to us to be rather due to the acquisition of wings,\r\n  as we have already stated on pages 2 and 120.)\r\n\r\n=Loss of limbs by disuse.=—Not only are one or both claws of a single\r\npair, or those of all the feet atrophied by disuse, but this process of\r\nreduction may extend to the entire limb.\r\n\r\n  In a few insects one of the claws of each foot is atrophied, as in\r\n  the feet of the Pediculidæ, of many Mallophaga, all of the Coccidæ,\r\n  in Bittacus, Hybusa (Orthoptera), several beetles of the family\r\n  Pselaphidæ, and a weevil (Brachybamus). Hoplia, etc., bear but a\r\n  single claw on the hind feet, while the allied Gymnoloma has only a\r\n  single claw on all the feet. Cybister has in general a single\r\n  immovable claw on the hind feet, but _Cybister scutellaris_ has,\r\n  according to Sharp, on the same feet an outer small and movable\r\n  claw. In the water bugs, Belostoma, etc., the fore feet end in a\r\n  single claw, while in others (Corisa) both claws are wanting on the\r\n  fore feet. Corisa also has no claws on the hind feet; Notonecta has\r\n  two claws on the anterior four feet, but none on the hind pair. In\r\n  Diplonychus, however, there are two small claws present. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 110.—Last tarsal joint of _Melolontha vulgaris_, drawn as if\r\n    transparent to show the inner mechanism: _un_, claws; _str_,\r\n    extensor plate; _s_, tendon of the flexor muscle; _vb_, elastic\r\n    membrane between the extensor plate and the sliding surface _u_;\r\n    _krh_, process of the ungual joint; _emp_, extensor spine, and _th_,\r\n    its two tactile hairs.—After Ockler, from Kolbe.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the Scarabæidæ, the individuals of both sexes of the fossorial\r\ngenus Ateuchus (_A. sacer_) and eight other genera, among them\r\n_Deltochilum gibbosum_ of the United States, have no tarsi on the\r\nanterior feet in either sex. The American genera Phanæus (Fig. 111),\r\nGromphas, and Streblopus have no tarsal joints in the male, but they are\r\npresent in the female, though much reduced in size, and also wanting,\r\nKolbe states, in many species of Phanæus. The peculiar genus\r\nStenosternus not only lacks the anterior feet, but also those of the\r\nsecond and third pair of legs are each reduced to a vestige in the shape\r\nof a simple, spur-like, clawless joint. The ungual joint is wanting in\r\nthe weevil Anoplus, and becomes small and not easily seen in four other\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\n  Ryder states that the evidence that the absence of fore tarsi in\r\n  Ateuchus is due to the inheritance of their loss by mutilation is\r\n  uncertain. Dr. Horn suggests that cases like Ateuchus and\r\n  Deltochilum, etc., “might be used as an evidence of the persistence\r\n  of a character gradually acquired through repeated mutilation, that\r\n  is, a loss of the tarsus by the digging which these insects\r\n  perform.” On the other hand, the numerous species of Phanæus do\r\n  quite as much digging, and the anterior tarsi of the male only are\r\n  wanting. “It is true,” he adds, “that many females are seen which\r\n  have lost their anterior tarsi by digging; have, in fact, worn them\r\n  off; but in recently developed specimens the front tarsi are always\r\n  absent in the males and present in the females. If repeated\r\n  mutilation has resulted in the entire disappearance of the tarsi in\r\n  one fossorial insect, it is reasonable to infer that the same\r\n  results should follow in a related insect in both sexes, if at all,\r\n  and not in the male only. It is evident that some other cause than\r\n  inherited mutilation must be sought for to explain the loss of the\r\n  tarsi in these insects.” (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., Philadelphia,\r\n  1889, pp. 529, 542.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 111.—Fore tibia of _Phanæus carnifex_, ♂, showing no trace of the\r\n    tarsus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 112.—Fore leg of the mole-cricket: _A_, outer, _B_, inner,\r\n    aspect; _e_, ear-slit.—After Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe loss of tarsi may be due to disuse rather than to the inheritance of\r\nmutilations. Judging by the enlarged fore tibiæ, which seem admirably\r\nadapted for digging, it would appear as if tarsi, even more or less\r\nreduced, would be in the way, and thus would be useless to the beetles\r\nin digging. Careful observations on the habits of these beetles might\r\nthrow light on this point. It may be added that the fore tarsi in the\r\nmore fossorial Carabidæ, such as Clivina and Scarites, as well as those\r\nof the larva of Cicada and those of the mole crickets (Fig. 112), are\r\nmore or less reduced; there is a hypertrophy of the tibiæ and their\r\nspines. The shape of the tibia in these insects, which are flattened\r\nwith several broad triangular spines, bears a strong resemblance to the\r\nnails or claws of the fossorial limbs of those mammals which dig in hard\r\nsoil, such as the armadillo, manis, aardvark, and Echidna. The principle\r\nof modification by disuse is well illustrated in the following cases.\r\n\r\nIn many butterflies the fore legs are small and shortened, and of little\r\nuse, and held pressed against the breast. In the Lycænidæ the fore tarsi\r\nare without claws; in Erycinidæ and Libytheidæ the fore legs of the\r\nmales are shortened, but completely developed in the females, while in\r\nthe Nymphalidæ the fore legs in both sexes are shortened, consisting in\r\nthe males of one or two joints, the claws being absent in the females.\r\nAmong moths loss of the fore tarsi is less frequent. J. B. Smith[21]\r\nnotices the lack of the fore tarsi in the male of a deltoid, _Litognatha\r\nnubilifasciata_ (Fig. 113), while the hind feet of _Hepialus hectus_ are\r\nshortened. In an aphid (_Mastopoda pteridis_, Esl.) all the tarsi are\r\nreduced to a single vestigial joint (Fig. 114).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 113.—Leg of Litognatha: _cx_, coxa; _f_, femur; _t_, tibia; _ep_,\r\n    its epiphysis, and _sh_, its shield-like process. The tarsus\r\n    entirely wanting.—After Smith.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEntirely legless adult insects are rare, and the loss is clearly seen to\r\nbe an adaptation due to disuse; such are the females of the Psychidæ,\r\nthe females of several genera of Coccidæ (Mytilaspis, etc.), and the\r\nfemales of the Stylopidæ.\r\n\r\nApodous larval insects are common, and the loss of legs is plainly seen\r\nto be a secondary adaptive feature, since there are annectant forms with\r\none or two pairs of thoracic legs. All dipterous and siphonapterous\r\nlarvæ, those of all the Hymenoptera except the saw-flies, a few\r\nlepidopterous larvæ, some coleopterous, as those of the Rhyncophora,\r\nBuprestidæ, Eucnemidæ, and other families, and many Cerambycidæ are\r\nwithout any legs. In _Eupsalis minuta_, belonging to the Brenthidæ, the\r\nthoracic legs are minute.\r\n\r\nThe legs of larvæ end in a single claw, upon the tips of which the\r\ninsect stands in walking.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _c._ Locomotion (walking, climbing, and swimming)\r\n\r\n=Mechanics of walking.=—To Graber we owe the best exposition of the\r\nmechanics of walking in insects.\r\n\r\n  “The first segment of the insect leg,” he says, “upon which the\r\n  weight of the body rests first of all, is the coxa. Its method of\r\n  articulation is very different from that of the other joints. The\r\n  enarthrosis affords the most extensive play, particularly in the\r\n  Hymenoptera and Diptera.”\r\n\r\n  In the former the development of their social conditions is very\r\n  closely connected with the freest possible use of the legs, which\r\n  serve as hands. In the beetles, however, which are very compactly\r\n  built, there exists a solid articulation whereby the entire hip\r\n  rests in a tent-like excavation of the thorax, and can only be\r\n  turned round a single axis, as may be seen in Fig. 115, where _c_\r\n  represents the imaginary revolving axis and _d_ the coxa. In the\r\n  case we are supposing, therefore, only a backward and forward\r\n  movement of the coxa is possible, the extent of the play of which\r\n  depends on the size of the coxal pan, as well as certain groin or\r\n  bar-like structures which limit further rotation. In the very\r\n  dissimilar arrangement which draws in the fore, middle, and hind\r\n  legs toward the body it is self-evident that their extent of action\r\n  is also different. This arrangement seems to be most yielding on the\r\n  fore legs, where the hips, to confine ourselves to the stag-beetles,\r\n  can be turned backward and forward 60° from the middle or normal\r\n  position, and therefore describe on the whole a curve of 120°. The\r\n  angle of turning on the middle leg hardly exceeds a legitimate\r\n  limit, yet a forward as well as a backward rotation takes place. The\r\n  former is entirely wanting in the hind hips; they can only be moved\r\n  backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 114.—Leg of an Aphid, with the tarsus (_t_) much reduced: 1, 2,\r\n    3, legs of 1st, 2d, and 3d pairs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The number and strength of the muscles on which the rotation of the\r\n  hips depends, correspond with these varying movements of the\r\n  individual legs. Thus, according to Straus Durckheim, the fore coxa\r\n  of many beetles possesses five separate muscles and four forward and\r\n  one backward roll; the middle coxa a like number of muscles but only\r\n  two forward rolls, while the hind hips succeed in accomplishing each\r\n  of the motions named with a single muscle.\r\n\r\n  One can best see how these muscles undertake their work, and above\r\n  all how they are situated, if he lays bare the prothorax of the stag\r\n  beetle (Fig. 116). Here may be seen first the thick muscle which\r\n  turns to the front the rotating axis in its cylindrical pan, and\r\n  thus helps to extend the leg, while two other tendons, which take\r\n  the opposite direction, are fitted for reflex movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 115.—Mechanics of an insect’s leg: _d_, coxa,—_c_, axis of\r\n    revolution; _a_ and _b_, the coxal muscles; _e_, trochanter muscle\r\n    (elevator of the femur); _f_, extensor,—_g_, flexor, of the tibia\r\n    (_pn_); _n_, tibial spine; _h_, flexor.—_i_, extensor, of the\r\n    foot; _k_, extensor,—_l_, flexor, of the claw; _po_, place of\r\n    flexure of the tibia; _p^1q_, leg after being turned back by the\r\n    coxa.—_p^1r_, by the simultaneous flexure of the tibia.

It may be\r\n  designated as the femoral lever.\r\n\r\n  The plane of direction in which the femur, as seen by the rotation\r\n  just mentioned, is moved, exactly coincides in insects with that of\r\n  the tibia and the foot, while all can be simultaneously raised or\r\n  dropped, or, as the case may be, stretched out or retracted.\r\n  Therein, therefore, lies an essential difference from the fully\r\n  developed extremities of vertebrates among which, even on the lever\r\n  arms which are stationary at the end, an extensive turning is\r\n  possible.\r\n\r\n  The muscles which move the tibia, and indirectly the femur, also\r\n  consist of an extensor muscle which is situated in the upper side of\r\n  the femur (Fig. 116, _s_, Fig. 115, _f_), and of a flexor (Fig. 116,\r\n  _b_, Fig. 115, _g_), which lies under the former.\r\n\r\n  The stilt-like spines on the point (Figs. 115 and 118, _L_{3}n_) on\r\n  which this segment is directly supported are important parts of the\r\n  tibia. (Graber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 117.—Left fore leg of a cerambycid beetle: _h_, coxa; _r_,\r\n    trochanter; _o_, femur; _u_, tibia; _f_, tarsus; _k_, claw.—After\r\n    Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nConsidering the respective positions of the individual levers of the leg\r\nand the nature of the materials of which they are made, the legs of\r\ninsects may be likened, as Graber states, to elastic bows, which, when\r\npressed down together from above, their own indwelling elasticity is\r\nable to raise again and thus keep the body upright.\r\n\r\nThis is very plainly shown in certain stilt-legged bark-beetles, in\r\nwhich, as in a rubber doll, as soon as the body is pressed down on the\r\nground, the organs of motion extend again without the intervention of\r\nmuscles; indeed this experiment succeeds even with dead, but not yet\r\nwholly stiff, insects.\r\n\r\nGraber then turns to the analysis of the movements of insect legs when\r\nin motion, and the mode of walking of these insects in general. This\r\nsubject had been but slightly investigated until Graber made a series of\r\nobservations and experiments, of which we can give only the most\r\nimportant results.\r\n\r\nThe locomotion of insects is an extremely complicated subject.\r\n\r\n  Let us consider, Graber says, first, a running or carabid beetle,\r\n  when walking merely with the fore and hind legs. The former will be\r\n  bent forward and the latter backward.\r\n\r\n  “Let us begin with the left fore leg (Fig. 118, _L_{1}_). Let the\r\n  same be extended and fixed on the ground by means of its sharp claws\r\n  and its pointed heel. Now what happens when the tibial flexors draw\r\n  together? As the foot, and therefore the tibia also, have a firm\r\n  position, then the contraction of the muscles named must cause the\r\n  femur to approach the tibia, whereby the whole body is drawn along\r\n  with it. This individual act of motion may be well studied in\r\n  grasshoppers when they are climbing on a twig by stretching out\r\n  their long fore leg directly forward, and then drawing up the body\r\n  through the shortening of the tibial flexors until the middle leg\r\n  also reaches the branch.\r\n\r\n  “But while the fore legs advance the body by drawing the free lever\r\n  to the fixed leg-segment, the hind legs do this in exactly the\r\n  opposite way. The hind leg, namely, seeks to stretch out the tibia,\r\n  and thus to increase the angle of the knee (_R_{3})_, thereby giving\r\n  a push on the ground, by means of which the body is shoved forward a\r\n  bit.\r\n\r\n  “Though it might be supposed that the feet would remain stationary\r\n  during the extension or retraction of the limbs, this never occurs\r\n  in actual walking. Not merely the upper, but also the lower, thigh\r\n  is either drawn in or stretched out, as the case may be. The latter\r\n  then describes a straight line with its point during this scraping\r\n  or scratching motion (Fig. 115, _no_), which is obviously the chord\r\n  to that quadrant which would be drawn by the tibia or foot in a\r\n  yielding medium, as water, for instance. But even this motion\r\n  results extremely rarely, and never in actual walking. If we fix our\r\n  eye anew upon the fore leg at the very moment when it is again\r\n  retracted, after the resultant ‘fixing,’ we shall then observe that\r\n  the hip also is simultaneously turned backward in a definite angle.\r\n  The tibia would describe the arc _nq_ (Fig. 115) by means of the\r\n  latter alone.\r\n\r\n  “This plane, in conjunction with the rectilinear ‘movement’ (_no_)\r\n  obtained by the retraction of the tibia, produces a path (_nr_), and\r\n  this is what is actually described by a painted foot upon a properly\r\n  prepared surface, as a sheet of paper;[22] supposing, however, that\r\n  the body in the meantime is not moved forward by other forces. In\r\n  the last case, and this indeed always takes place in running, the\r\n  trunk is moved a bit forward, together with the leg which is just\r\n  describing its curve with a rapidity corresponding to the momentum\r\n  obtained; the result of this is that the curve of the foot from its\r\n  beginning (_n_) to its end (_a_) bends round close to itself, just\r\n  as a man who, when on board a ship in motion, walks across it\r\n  diagonally, and yet on the whole moves forward, because his line of\r\n  march, uniting with that of the ship, results in a change of\r\n  position in space.\r\n\r\n  “The case is the same in the middle and hind legs, which must make a\r\n  double course also, yet in such a way that the straight line is\r\n  drawn, not during the retraction, but during the extension; during\r\n  which, however, quite as in the fore leg, the members mentioned\r\n  (_R_{3}_) gradually approach the body.\r\n\r\n  “When the legs have reached the maximum of their retraction, or of\r\n  their extension, as the case may be, and therefore the end of their\r\n  active course for that time, then begins the opposite or backward\r\n  movement; that is, the fore legs are again extended, while their\r\n  levers draw the remaining legs together again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 118.—A Carabus beetle in the act of walking or running: three\r\n    legs (_L_{1}_, _R_{2}_, _L_{3}_) are directed forward, while the\r\n    others (_R_{1}_, _L_{2}_, _R_{3}_), which are directed backward\r\n    toward the tail, have ended their activity; _ab_, _cd_, and _ef_\r\n    are curves described by the end of the tibiæ, and passing back to\r\n    the end of the body; _bh_, _di_, and _fg_ are curves described by\r\n    the same legs during their passive change of position.—After\r\n    Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “At the same time, as we may see by the uniting leg, the limb is\r\n  either a little raised, that there may be no unnecessary friction,\r\n  or it remains during the passive step also, with its means of\r\n  locomotion in slight contact with the ground.\r\n\r\n  “The curve of two steps, as inscribed by the end of the tibia of the\r\n  left fore leg of a stag-beetle, affords an instructive summary of\r\n  the conditions of which we have been speaking (Fig. 121, _B_). We\r\n  see two curves. The thick one (_ab_), directed toward the axis of\r\n  the body, corresponds to the effective act of a single walking\r\n  function, which brings the body a bit forward; the thinner, on the\r\n  other hand, or we might say the hair line (_bc_), which, however, is\r\n  but rarely made quite clearly, is produced by the ineffectual\r\n  backward movement, by which the insect again approaches its working\r\n  posture (_c_). It is at first placed at some distance from the body,\r\n  in order that (like _c_ also) it may draw near to the body again;\r\n  but in such a way, naturally, that it coincides with the\r\n  starting-point of the following active curve (_cd_). It is evident\r\n  that even the passive curve is not the imprint of the movement\r\n  accomplished exclusively by the leg, for this latter, while\r\n  struggling to reach its resting-place, is really involuntarily\r\n  carried forward with the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n  “The scroll-like lines drawn by the swimming beetle (Dyticus), with\r\n  the large, sharp points of its hind tibia, are also very instructive\r\n  (Fig. 119, _A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 119.—_A_, trail curves described by the tibial spines of the\r\n    right and left hind limb of Dyticus. _B_, the same made by the\r\n    right hind leg (_r_{3}_) alone.

In the May-beetles, and even more in the running\r\n  garden-beetle, the curves of the hind legs present themselves as\r\n  screw-like lines (Fig. 122, _l_{3}_), while the scrawling of the\r\n  remaining members (_l_{1}_, _l_{2}_) is much simpler.\r\n\r\n  “Inasmuch as we now have a cursory knowledge of the movements made\r\n  by each individual leg for itself,—movements, however, which plainly\r\n  occur very differently according to the structure of these\r\n  appendages,—the question now is of the combined play, the total\r\n  effect of all the legs taken together, and therefore of the walk and\r\n  measure of the united work of the foot.\r\n\r\n  “In opposition to the caterpillars and many other crawling animals\r\n  which extend their legs in pairs and really swing them by the\r\n  worm-like mode of contraction of the dermo-muscular tube, the legs\r\n  of fully grown insects are moved in the contrary direction and in no\r\n  sense in pairs, but alternately—or, more strictly speaking, in a\r\n  diagonal direction.\r\n\r\n  “For an examination of the gait of insects, we choose, for obvious\r\n  reasons, those which have very long legs and which at the same time\r\n  are slow walkers.\r\n\r\n  “Insects may be called ‘double-three-footed,’ from the manner in\r\n  which they alternately place their legs. There are always three legs\r\n  set in motion at the same time, or nearly so, while in the meantime\r\n  the remaining legs support the body, after which they change places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 122.—The same by the left fore (_l_{1}_), middle (_l_{2}_), and\r\n    hind, leg (_l_{3}_) of a Carabus.

Natural size.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “To be more exact, it is usually thus: At first (Fig. 118) the left\r\n  fore leg (_L_{1}_) steps out, then follows the right middle leg\r\n  (_R_{2}_), and the left hind leg (_L_{3}_). Then while the left fore\r\n  leg begins to retract and thus make the backward movement, the right\r\n  fore leg is extended, whereupon the left middle leg and the right\r\n  hind leg are raised in the same order as the first three feet.”\r\n\r\n  Graber[23] painted the feet of beetles and let them run over paper,\r\n  and goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  “Let us first pursue the tracks of the Blaps, for example (Fig.\r\n  123). Let the insect begin its motion. The left fore leg stands at\r\n  _a_, the right middle leg at β, and the left hind leg at _c_. The\r\n  corresponding number of the other set of three feet at α, _b_, γ. At\r\n  the first step the three feet first mentioned advance to _a′_β′_c′_,\r\n  the second set on the other hand to α′_b′_γ′. Thereby the tracks\r\n  made by the successive steps fall quite, or almost quite, on each\r\n  other, as appear also in the tracks of a burying beetle (Fig. 124).\r\n\r\n  “As the fore legs are directed forward and the hind legs backward,\r\n  while the middle legs are placed obliquely, the reason of the more\r\n  marked impressions of the latter is evident.\r\n\r\n  “The highest testimony to the precise exactitude and accuracy of the\r\n  walking mechanism of insects is furnished by the fact that in most\r\n  insects, and particularly in those most fleet of foot, which,\r\n  whether they are running away or chasing their prey, must be able to\r\n  rely entirely upon their means of locomotion;—the fact, we say, that\r\n  whether they desire to move slowly or more quickly, the distances of\r\n  the steps, measured by the length as well as by the cross-direction,\r\n  hardly differ a hair’s breadth from one another, and this is also\r\n  the case when the tarsi are cut off and the insects are obliged to\r\n  run on the points of their heels (tibiæ).\r\n\r\n  “Thence, inasmuch as the trunk of insects is carried by two legs and\r\n  by one on each side alternately, it may surely be concluded _a\r\n  priori_ that when walking it is inclined now to the right and now to\r\n  the left, and that the track, too, which is left behind by a precise\r\n  point of the leg, can in no wise be a straight line; and in reality\r\n  this is not the case.\r\n\r\n  “A plainly marked regular curve, which approaches a sinuous line, as\r\n  seen in Fig. 125, is often obtained by painting many insects, for\r\n  example Trichodes, Meloë, etc., which, when running, either bring\r\n  the end of their hind body near to the ground or into contact with\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 125.—Tracks of Trichodes; the middle sinuous line is made by\r\n    the tip of the abdomen.

In the latter case,\r\n  that is, if one cuts off a pair of legs from an insect, the trunk\r\n  can balance itself only with extreme difficulty, and there is\r\n  therefore little prospect that insects will ever become four-footed.\r\n\r\n  “But if one compels insects to run on three legs, he will thus make\r\n  the interesting discovery that to make up the deficiency they place\r\n  the remaining feet and bring them to the ground somewhat differently\r\n  than when the second set of feet is active. Figs. 124 and 126 may be\r\n  compared for this purpose. The former shows the footprints of a\r\n  burying beetle running with all six legs, the latter the track of\r\n  the same insect, which, however, has at its disposal only the right\r\n  fore leg, the left middle leg, and the right hind leg. One may\r\n  plainly see here that the track of the hind leg on the right side\r\n  (_r_{3}_) approaches the track of the middle leg on the left side,\r\n  and then further, that the _right fore leg_ (_r_{1}_) _steps out\r\n  more to the right to make up for the deficiency of the middle leg_.\r\n\r\n  “A similar adaptation of the position of the legs, which is entirely\r\n  dependent on the choice of the insect, may also be observed there,\r\n  if one compels insects which are not provided with corresponding\r\n  adhesive lobes to run away over crooked surfaces. Fig. 123 shows the\r\n  footprints of a Blaps when running upon a horizontal plane. Fig.\r\n  127, on the contrary, shows the tracks of the legs when going\r\n  diagonally over a gradually inclined surface. Here, also, the insect\r\n  holds on with his fore and middle legs (_r_{1}_, _r_{2}_) stretched\r\n  upward, whereby also the impressions on both sides come to lie\r\n  farther apart than in the normal mode of walking.\r\n\r\n  “It will not surprise the reader who is familiar with the gait of\r\n  crabs, to hear that many insects also understand the laudable art of\r\n  going backward, wherein the hind legs simply change places with the\r\n  fore legs.\r\n\r\n  “The jumping motion of insects may be best studied in grasshoppers.\r\n  When these insects are preparing for a jump, they stretch out the\r\n  upper thigh horizontally, clap the tibiæ together, and also retract\r\n  the foot-segment. After a slight pause for rest, during which they\r\n  are getting ready for the jump, they then jerk the tibiæ suddenly\r\n  backward and against the ground with all their strength by means of\r\n  the extensor muscles.”\r\n\r\nThe correctness of Graber’s views has been confirmed by Marey by\r\ninstantaneous photographs (Figs. 128, 129).\r\n\r\n=Locomotion on smooth surfaces.=—How flies and other insects are able to\r\nwalk up, or run with the body inverted, on hard surfaces has been lately\r\ndiscovered by Dewitz, Dahl, and others. All authors are agreed that this\r\npower is due to the presence of the specialized empodium of each tarsus.\r\n\r\nDewitz confirmed the opinion of Blackwell, that a glutinous liquid is\r\nexuded from the apices of the tenent hairs which fringe the empodium. By\r\nfastening insects feet uppermost on the under side of a covering glass\r\nwhich projects from a glass slide, the hairs which clothe the empodia of\r\nthe foot of a fly (_Musca erythrocephala_) may be seen to be tipped with\r\ndrops of transparent liquid. On the leg being drawn back from the glass,\r\na transparent thread is drawn out, and drops are found to be left on the\r\nglass. In cases where these hairs are wanting, as in the Hemiptera, the\r\nadhesive fluid exudes directly from pores in the foot. In the beetles\r\n(_Telephorus dispar_) and other insects the tenent hairs on the foot end\r\nin sharp points, below which are placed the openings of the canals. The\r\nglands, Dewitz states, are chiefly flask-shaped and unicellular,\r\nsituated in the hypodermis of the chitinous coat; each gland opening\r\ninto one of the hairs (Fig. 108); they are each invested by a\r\nstructureless tunica propria, and contain granular protoplasm, a nucleus\r\nplaced at the inner side, and a vesicle, prolonged into a tube which,\r\ntraversing the neck of the gland, is attached to the root of the hair;\r\nthe vesicle receiving the secretion. Each gland is connected with a fine\r\nnerve-twig, and secretion is probably voluntary. Among the tenent hairs\r\nof the empodium are others which must be supplied with a nerve, forming\r\ntactile hairs, as they each proceed from a unicellular ganglion (Fig.\r\n108, _n″_). The secretion is forced out of the gland by the contraction\r\nof the protoplasm, Dewitz having seen the secretion driven out from the\r\ninternal vesicle into its neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 128.—The walk of an orthopterous insect: series to be followed\r\n    from right to left.—After Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 129.—Beetle walking: series to be followed from left to\r\n    right.—After Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 130.—_A_, end of an adhesive hair of a weevil (Eupolus): _i′_,\r\n    canal: _i‴_, its external opening at the end of the hair. _B_, end\r\n    of a similar hair of Telephorus with drops of the secretion.—After\r\n    Dewitz.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the spherical last tarsal joint of Orthoptera (Fig. 109), which\r\n  is without these tenent hairs, nearly all the cells of the\r\n  hypodermis are converted into unicellular glands, each of which\r\n  sends out a long, fine, chitinous tubule, which is connected with\r\n  its fellows by very fine hairs and is continuous with the chitinous\r\n  coat of the foot and opens through it. The sole of the foot is\r\n  elastic and adapts itself to minute inequalities of surfaces, while\r\n  the anterior of each tarsal joint is almost entirely occupied by an\r\n  enlargement of the trachea, which acts on the elastic sole like an\r\n  air chamber, rendering it tense and at the same time pliant. Dewitz\r\n  adds that the apparatus situated on the front legs of the male of\r\n  _Stenobothrus sibiricus_ (Fig. 131) must have the function of\r\n  causing the legs to adhere closely to the female by the excretion of\r\n  an adhesive material. The hairs of the anterior tarsi of male Carabi\r\n  also appear to possess the power of adhesion. In the house-fly the\r\n  empodia seem to be only called into action when the insect has to\r\n  walk on vertical smooth surfaces, as at other times they hang\r\n  loosely down.\r\n\r\n  Burmeister observed the use of a glutinous secretion for walking in\r\n  dipterous larvæ, and Dewitz found that the larva of a Musca used for\r\n  this purpose a liquid ejected from the mouth. The larvæ of another\r\n  fly (_Leucopis puncticornis_) perform their loop-like walk by\r\n  emitting a fluid from both mouth and anus. A Cecidomyia larva is\r\n  able to leap by fixing its anterior end by means of an adhesive\r\n  fluid. The larva of the leaf-beetle, Galeruca, moves by drawing up\r\n  its hinder end, fixing it thus, and carrying the anterior part of\r\n  the body forward with its feet until fully extended, when it breaks\r\n  the glutinous adhesion. The abdominal legs of some saw-fly larvæ\r\n  have the same power.\r\n\r\nDahl could not detect in the foot of the hornet (_Vespa crabro_) any\r\nspace which could be considered as a vacuum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 131.—_Stenobothrus sibiricus_ pairing: _A_. the ♂, fore tarsus\r\n    (_t_) greatly enlarged; _ar_, arolia; _p_, pulvillus.—After\r\n    Pagenstecher.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSimmermacher states that in most cases of climbing beetles the tubular\r\ntenent hairs pour out a secretion (Figs. 133, 134), “and it is probable\r\nthat we have here to do with the phenomena not of actual attachment by,\r\nas it were, gluing, but of adhesion; the orifice of the tubes is divided\r\nobliquely, and the tubes are, at this point, extremely delicate and\r\nflexible, so as to adhere by their lower surface; in this adhesion they\r\nare aided by the secreted fluid.” In the case of the Diptera he does not\r\naccept the theory by which the movement of the fly along smooth surfaces\r\nis ascribed to an alternate fixation and separation, but believes in a\r\nprocess of adhesion, aided by a secretion, as in many Coleoptera. (In\r\nthe Cerambycidæ there is no secretion, and the tubules are merely\r\nsucking organs, like those observed in the male Silphidæ.) “The\r\nattaching lobes, closely beset with chitinous hairs, are enabled, in\r\nconsequence of the pressure of the foot, to completely lie along any\r\nsmooth surface; this expels the air beneath the lobes, which are then\r\nacted on by the pressure of the outer air.” (Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc.,\r\n1884, p. 736.) Another writer (Rombouts) thinks this power is due to\r\ncapillary adhesion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 132.—Fore leg of ♂ Dyticus, under side, with sucker, formed of 3\r\n    enlarged tarsal joints: with a small cupule highly magnified. ×\r\n    120.—After Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe action of the pulvillus and claws when at rest or in use by the\r\nhoney-bee is well shown by Cheshire (Fig. 135, _B_). In ascending a\r\nrough surface, “the points of the claws catch (as at _B_) and the\r\npulvillus is saved from any contact, but if the surface be smooth, so\r\nthat the claws get no grip, they slide back and are drawn beneath the\r\nfoot (as at _A_), which change of position applies the pulvillus, so\r\nthat it immediately clings. It is the character of the surface, then,\r\nand not the will of the bee, that determines whether claw or pulvillus\r\nshall be used in sustaining it. But another contrivance, equally\r\nbeautiful, remains to be noticed. The pulvillus is carried folded in the\r\nmiddle (as at _C_, Fig. 105), but opens out when applied to a surface;\r\nfor it has at its upper part an elastic and curved rod (_cr_, Figs. 105\r\nand 135), which straightens as the pulvillus is pressed down; _C_ and\r\n_D_, Fig. 135, making this clear. The flattened-out pulvillus thus holds\r\nstrongly while pulled, by the weight of the bee, along the surface, to\r\nwhich it adheres, but comes up at once if lifted and rolled off from its\r\nopposite sides, just as we should pull a wet postage stamp from an\r\nenvelope. The bee, then, is held securely till it attempts to lift the\r\nleg, when it is freed at once; and, by this exquisite yet simple plan,\r\nit can fix and release each foot at least twenty times per second.”\r\n(Bees and Bee-keeping, p. 127.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 133.—Cross-section through a tarsal joint of fore leg of Dyticus,\r\n    ♂, showing the stalked chitinous suckers (_s_), with a marginal\r\n    bristle on each side: _t_, trachea; _a_, an isolated tubule or\r\n    sucker of Loricera,—_b_, of Chlænius,—_c_, of Cicindela; _d_, two\r\n    views of one of _Necrophorus germanicus_, ♂.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 134.—Section through the tarsus of a Staphylinid beetle; the\r\n    glandular or tenent hairs arising from chitinous processes. _A_,\r\n    section through the tarsal joint of the pine weevil, _Hylobius\r\n    abietis_, showing the crowded, bulbous, glandular, or tenent hairs\r\n    arising from unicellular glands.—This and Fig. 133 after\r\n    Simmermacher.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOckler divides the normal two-clawed foot into three subtypes: (1) with\r\nan unpaired median empodium; (2) with two outer lateral adhesive lobes;\r\n(3) with two adhesive lobes below the claws; the latter is the chief\r\ntype and forms either a climbing or a clasping foot. The amount of\r\nmovement possessed by the claws is limited, and what there is, is\r\neffected by means of an elastic membrane and the extensor plate (Fig.\r\n110). The “extensor sole” which is always present in insects with an\r\nunpaired median fixing or adhesive organ (empodium) is to be regarded as\r\na modification of the extensor seta. The extensor plate is peculiar to\r\nan insect’s foot. Ockler states that the so-called “pressure plate” of\r\nDahl is only a movably articulated, skeletal, supporting plate for the\r\nmedian fixing lobule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 135.—Honey-bee’s foot in the act of climbing, showing the\r\n    automatic action of the pulvillus, × 30: _A_, position of foot in\r\n    climbing on a slippery surface, or glass; _pv_, pulvillus; _fh_,\r\n    tactile hairs; _un_, unguis; _t_, last tarsal joint. _B_, position\r\n    of foot in climbing rough surface. _C_, section of pulvillus just\r\n    touching flat surface; _cr_, curved rod. _D_, the same applied to\r\n    the surface.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Climbing.=—In certain respects the power of climbing supplies the want\r\nof wings, and even exists often in house-flies among which there is\r\nshown a many-sided motion that is quite unheard of in other groups of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe best climbers are obviously those insects which live on trees and\r\nbushes, as, for example, longicorn beetles and grasshoppers. These may\r\nbe accurately called the monkeys of the insect kind, even if their\r\nmovements take place less gracefully, and indeed rather stiffly and\r\nwoodenly. We already know what are the proper climbing organs; that is,\r\nthe sharp easily movable claws on the foot. With the help of these claws\r\ncertain insects, May-beetles for example, can hang upon one another like\r\na chain; indeed, bees and ants in this manner bind themselves together\r\ninto living garlands and bridges. There are still added to the chitinous\r\nhooks flaps and balls of a sticky nature, by help of which likewise the\r\ninsects glue themselves together. To facilitate the spanning of still\r\nthicker twigs, the climbing foot of insects has a greater movability\r\neven than when it only serves as a sole. (Graber.)\r\n\r\n=The mode of swimming of insects.=—To study the swimming movements of\r\ninsects, let us examine a Dyticus. It will appear, as Graber states, to\r\nbe wonderfully adapted to its element.\r\n\r\n  “The body resembles a boat. There is nowhere a projecting point or a\r\n  sharp corner which would offer unnecessary resistance to motion;\r\n  bulging out in the middle and pointed at the end, it cuts through\r\n  the resistance of the water like a wedge. The movable parts, the\r\n  oars, seem to be as well fitted for their purpose as the burden to\r\n  be moved by them. That the hind legs must bear the brunt of this\r\n  follows from their position exactly in the middle of the body, where\r\n  it is widest. In other insects also these legs are used for the same\r\n  purpose as soon as the insects are put in the water. But the\r\n  swimming legs of water-beetles are oars of quite peculiar\r\n  construction. _They are not turned about in the coxæ, as are other\r\n  legs, but at the foot-joint._ The coxa, namely, has grown entirely\r\n  together with the thoracic partition. The muscles we have mentioned,\r\n  exceeding in strength all the soft parts taken together, take hold\r\n  directly of the large wing-shaped tendons of the upper thigh, and\r\n  extend and retract the leg in one of the planes lying close to the\r\n  abdominal partition. The foot forms the oar, however. It is very\r\n  much lengthened and still more widened, and can be turned and bent\r\n  in by separate muscles in such a way that in the passive movement,\r\n  that is, the retraction, the narrow edge is turned to the fore, and\r\n  therefore to the medium to be dislodged; however, as soon as the\r\n  active push is to be performed and the leg is extended with greater\r\n  force, it cuts down through the water with its whole width. These\r\n  effective oar-blades are still considerably enlarged by the hairs\r\n  arising on the side of the foot, which spread out at the decisive\r\n  moment.\r\n\r\n  “Every one knows that the oar-blades of swimming beetles always go\r\n  up and down simultaneously and in regular time. On the other hand,\r\n  as soon as one puts a Dyticus on the dry land, _i.e._ on an\r\n  unyielding medium, it uses its hind legs entirely after the manner\r\n  of other land insects; that is, they are drawn in and extended again\r\n  _alternately_, as takes place clearly enough from the footsteps in\r\n  Fig. 119, _A_. We learn from this that water insects have not yet,\r\n  from want of practice, forgotten the mode of walking of land\r\n  insects.\r\n\r\n  “The forcing up of the water as a propelling power is added to the\r\n  repulsion produced by the strong strokes of the oars. If the beetle\r\n  stood up horizontally in the water, he would be lifted up.\r\n\r\n  “As the trunk, however, assumes an oblique position when the insect\r\n  wishes to swim, one can then imagine the driving up of the water as\r\n  being divided into two forces, one of which drives the body forward\r\n  in a horizontal direction, while the other, that is, the vertical\r\n  component, is supplied by the moving of the oars. The swimming\r\n  insect is thus, as it were, a snake flying in the water.\r\n\r\n  “The long streamer-like hind legs of many water-bugs, for example\r\n  Notonecta, approach more nearly our artificial oars. These legs are\r\n  turned out from the bottom.\r\n\r\n  “There is no doubt but that the legs of insects, as regards the\r\n  many-sidedness and exactitude of their locomotive actions, place the\r\n  similar contrivances of other animals far in the shade. We shall be\r\n  forced to admire these ingenious levers still more, however, when we\r\n  take into consideration their energy and strength. That the force\r\n  with which the locomotive muscles of insects is drawn together is\r\n  enormous compared with that of vertebrates, we may learn if we try\r\n  to subdue the rhythmical movements of the thorax of a large\r\n  butterfly by the pressure of our finger or to open against the\r\n  insect’s will the closed jumping leg of a grasshopper, or the\r\n  fossorial shovel of a mole-cricket.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LITERATURE ON LEGS AND FEET\r\n\r\n\r\n  =MacLeay, W.

The wings are thin, broad leaf-like\r\nfolds of the integument, attached to the thorax and moved by powerful\r\nmuscles which occupy the greater part of the thoracic cavity. The two\r\npairs of wings are outgrowths of the middle and hinder part of the\r\nthorax, the anterior pair being attached to the mesothoracic and the\r\nhinder pair to the metathoracic segment. The larger pair is developed\r\nfrom the middle segment of the thorax. The differentiation of the\r\ntergites into scutum, scutellum, etc., is the result of the appearance\r\nof wings, because these sclerites are more or less reduced or effaced in\r\nwingless insects, such as apterous Orthoptera and moths, ants, etc.\r\n\r\nThe size of the hinder thoracic segments is closely related to that of\r\nthe wings they bear. In those Orthoptera which have hind wings larger\r\nthan those of the fore pair, the metathorax is larger than the\r\nmesothorax. In such Neuroptera as have the hind wings nearly or quite as\r\nlarge as the anterior pair, or in the Trichoptera and in the Hepialidæ,\r\nthe metathorax is nearly as large as the mesothorax, while in Coleoptera\r\nthe metathorax is as large and often much larger. In the Ephemeridæ,\r\nDiptera, and Hymenoptera, which have either only rudimentary (halteres)\r\nor small hind wings, the metathorax is correspondingly reduced in size.\r\n\r\nThe wings morphologically, as their development shows, are simple\r\nsac-like outgrowths of the integument, _i.e._ of the free hinder edge of\r\nthe tergal plates, their place of origin being apparently above the\r\nupper edge of the epimera or pleural sclerites. Calvert[24] however,\r\nregards the upper lamina of the wing as tergal, and the lower, pleural.\r\n\r\nThe wings in most insects are attached to the thorax by a membrane\r\ncontaining several little plates of chitin called by Audouin\r\narticulatory epidemes.\r\n\r\nThe wings, then, are simple, very thin chitinous lamellate expansions of\r\nthe integument, which are supported and strengthened by an internal\r\nframework of hollow chitinous tubes.\r\n\r\n=The veins.=—The so-called “veins” or “nervures,” which are situated\r\nbetween the upper and under layers of the wing are so disposed as to\r\ngive the greatest lightness and strength to the wings. Hagen has shown\r\nthat in the freshly formed wings these two layers can be separated, when\r\nit can be seen that the veins pass through each layer.\r\n\r\nThese veins are in reality quite complex, consisting of a minute central\r\ntrachea enclosed within a larger tube which at the instant the insect\r\nemerges from the nymph, or pupa, as the case may be, is filled with\r\nblood (Fig. 136). Since these tubes at first contain blood, which has\r\nbeen observed to circulate through them, and since the heart can be most\r\neasily injected through them, they may more properly be called veins\r\nthan nervures. The shape and venation of the wings afford excellent\r\nordinal as well as family and generic characters, while they also enable\r\nthe systematist to exactly locate the spots and other markings of the\r\nwings. The spaces enclosed by the veins and their cross-branches are\r\ncalled cells, and their shape often affords valuable generic and\r\nspecific characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 136.—Cross-section of wing of Pronuba.—After Spuler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137.—Cross-section of wing of Pieris: _s_, insertions of\r\n    scales.-After Spuler.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe structure of a complete vein is described by Spuler. In a\r\ncross-section of a noctuid moth (_Triphæna pronuba_, Fig. 136) the\r\nchitinous walls are seen to consist of two layers, an outer (U) and\r\ninner (_c_), the latter of which takes a stain and lies next to the\r\nhypodermis (_hy_). In the cavity of the vein is the trachea (_tr_),\r\nwhich shows more or less distinctly the so-called spiral thread; within\r\nthe cavity are also Semper’s “rib” (_r_) and blood-corpuscles (_bc_),\r\nwhich proves that the blood circulates in the veins of the completely\r\nformed wing, though this does not apply to all Lepidoptera with hard\r\nmature wings. We have been able to observe the same structure in\r\nsections of the wing of Zygæna.\r\n\r\nA cross-section of a vein of _Pieris brassicæ_ shows that the large\r\ntrachea is first formed, and that it extends along the track between the\r\nprotoplasmic threads connecting the two hypodermal layers.\r\n\r\nThe main tracheæ throw off on both sides a number of secondary branches\r\nshowing at their end a cell with an intracellular tracheal structure;\r\nthese accessory tracheæ afterwards branch out. The accessory or\r\ntransverse tracheæ often disappear, though in some moths they remain\r\npermanently. Fig. 137 _tr_{2}_ represents these secondary veins in the\r\nedge of the fore wing of _Laverna vanella_, arising from a main trachea\r\n(_tr_) passing through vein I (_v_), two of the twigs extending to the\r\ncentre, showing that the latter has no homology with a true vein. Only\r\nrarely and in strongly developed thick folds are the transverse tracheæ\r\nprovided with a chitinous thickening, as for example in _Cossus\r\nligniperda_. Since from such accessory tracheæ the transverse veins in\r\nlepidopterous wings are developed, we can recognize in them the\r\nhomologies of the net-veins in reticulated venations. There is no\r\nsharply defined difference between reticulated and non-reticulated\r\nvenations; no genetic difference exists between the two kinds of\r\nvenation, since there occur true Blattidæ both with and without a\r\nreticulated venation (Spuler).\r\n\r\nIn the fore wings of Odonata, Psocina, Mantispidæ, and most Hymenoptera\r\nis an usually opaque colored area between the costal edge and the median\r\nvein, called the _pterostigma_.\r\n\r\nIn shape the wings are either triangular or linear oval, and at the\r\nfront edge the main veins are closer together than elsewhere, thus\r\nstrengthening the wings and affording the greatest resistance to the air\r\nin making the downward stroke during flight. It is noticeable that when\r\nthe veins are in part aborted from partial disuse of the wings, they\r\ndisappear first from the hinder and middle edge, those on the costal\r\nregion persisting. This is seen in the wings of Embiidæ (Oligotoma),\r\nCynipidæ, Proctotrupidæ, Chalcids, ants, etc.\r\n\r\nThe front edge of the wing is called the costal, its termination in the\r\nouter angle of the wing is called the apex; the outer edge (termen) is\r\nsituated between the apex and the inner or anal angle, between which and\r\nthe base of the wing is the inner or internal edge.\r\n\r\nWhile in Orthoptera, dragon-flies, Termitidæ, and Neuroptera the wings\r\nare not attached to each other, in many Lepidoptera they are loosely\r\nconnected by the loop and frenulum, or in Hymenoptera by a series of\r\nstrong hooks. These hooks are arranged, says Newport, “in a slightly\r\ntwisted or spiral direction along the margin of the wing, so as to\r\nresemble a screw, and when the wings are expanded attach themselves to a\r\nlittle fold on the posterior margin of the anterior wing, along which\r\nthey play very freely when the wings are in motion, slipping to and fro\r\nlike the rings on the rod of a window curtain.”\r\n\r\nAt the base of the hind wings of Trichoptera and in the lepidopterous\r\nMicropteryx there is an angular fold (_jugum_) at the base of each wing\r\n(Fig. 138); that of the anterior wings is retained in Eriocephala and\r\nHepialidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 138.—Venation of fore and hind wings of _Micropteryx purpurella_:\r\n    _j_, jugum, on each wing; _d_, discal vein; the Roman numerals\r\n    indicate veins I.-VIII. and their branches.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the wings of Orthoptera as well as other insects, the fore wings,\r\nespecially, are divided into three well-marked areas, the costal,\r\nmedian, and internal; of these the median area is the largest, and in\r\ngrasshoppers and crickets is more or less modified to form the musical\r\napparatus, consisting of the drum-like resonant area, with the file or\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n=The squamæ.=—In the calyptrate Muscidæ, a large scale-like membranous\r\nbroad orbicular whitish process is situated beneath the base of the\r\nwing, above the halter; (Fig. 94, 10 _sq._) it is either small or\r\nwanting in the acalyptrate muscids. Kirby and Spence state that when the\r\ninsect is at rest the two divisions of this double lobe are folded over\r\neach other, but are extended during flight. Their exact use is unknown.\r\nKolbe, following other German authors, considers the term _squama_ as\r\napplicable to the whole structure, restricting the term _alula_ to the\r\nother lobe-like division.\r\n\r\n  More recently (1890 and 1897) Osten-Sacken recommends “_squamæ_; in\r\n  the plural, as a designation for both of these organs taken\r\n  together; _squama_, in the singular, would mean the posterior squama\r\n  alone, and _antisquama_ the anterior squama alone;” the strip of\r\n  membrane running in some cases between them, or connecting the\r\n  squama with the scutellum, should be called the _post-alar\r\n  membrane_. By a mistake Loew, and others following him, used the\r\n  word _tegula_ for _squama_, but this term should be restricted to\r\n  the sclerite of the mesothorax previously so designated (Fig. 90,\r\n  _A_, _t_). The squama or its two subdivisions has also by various\r\n  authors been termed alula, calypta, squamula, lobulus, axillary\r\n  lobe, aileron, cuilleron, schuppen, and scale. (Berlin Ent.\r\n  Zeitschrift, xli, 1896, pp. 285–288, 328, 338.)\r\n\r\n=The halteres.=—In the Diptera the hind wings are modified to form the\r\n_halteres_ or balancers, which are present in all the species, even in\r\nNycteribia, but are absent in Braula.\r\n\r\n  Meinert finds structures in the Lepidoptera which he considers as\r\n  the homologues of the halteres of Diptera. “In the Noctuidæ,” he\r\n  remarks, “I find arising from the fourth thoracic segment (segment\r\n  médiaire), but covered by hair, an organ like the halter of\r\n  Diptera.” (Ent. Tidskrift., i, 1880, p. 168.) He gives no details.\r\n\r\nIn the Stylopidæ, on the contrary, the fore wings are reduced to little\r\nnarrow pads, while the hind wings are of great size.\r\n\r\nThe _thyridium_ is a whitish spot marking a break in the cubital vein of\r\nthe fore wing of Trichoptera; these minute thyridia occur in the fore\r\nwings of the saw-flies; there is also an intercostal thyridium on the\r\ncostal part of the wings of Dermaptera.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of Orthoptera are thicker than the hinder ones, and serve\r\nto protect the hind-body when the wings are folded; they are sometimes\r\ncalled _tegmina_. It is noteworthy, that, according to Scudder, in all\r\nthe paleozoic cockroaches the fore wings (tegmina) were as distinctly\r\nveined as the hinder pair, “and could not in any sense be called\r\ncoriaceous.” (Pretertiary Insects of N. A., p. 39.) Scudder also\r\nobserves that in the paleozoic insects as a rule the fore and hind wings\r\nwere similar in shape and venation, “heterogeneity making its appearance\r\nin mesozoic times.” In the heteropterous Hemiptera, also, the basal half\r\nof the fore wings is thick and coriaceous or parchment-like, and also\r\nprotects the body when they are folded; these wings are called\r\n_hemelytra_. In the Dermaptera the small short fore wings are thickened\r\nand elytriform.\r\n\r\n=The elytra.=—This thickening of the fore wings is carried out to its\r\nfullest extent in the fore wings of beetles, where they form the\r\nsheaths, shards, or _elytra_, under which the hind wings are folded. The\r\nindexed costal edge is called the _epipleurum_, being wide in the\r\nTenebrionidæ. During flight “the elytra are opened so as to form an\r\nangle with the body and admit of the free play of the wings” (Kirby and\r\nSpence). In the running beetles (Carabidæ), also in the weevils and in\r\nmany Ptinidae, the hind wings are wanting, through disuse, and often the\r\nelytra are firmly united, forming a single hard shell or case. The\r\nfirmness of the elytra is due both to the thickness of the chitinous\r\ndeposit and to the presence of minute chitinous rods or pillars\r\nconnecting the upper and lower chitinous surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 139.—Longitudinal section through the edge of the elytrum of\r\n    _Lina ænea_: _gl_, glands; _r_, reservoir; _fb_, fat-body; _m_,\r\n    matrix; _u_, upper,—_l_, lower, lamella.—After Hoffbauer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHoffbauer finds that in the elytra of beetles of different families the\r\nvenation characteristic of the hind wings is wanting, the main tracheæ\r\nbeing irregular or arranged in closely parallel longitudinal lines, and\r\nnerve-fibres pass along near them, sense-organs being also present. The\r\nfat-bodies in the cavity of the elytra, which is lined with a matrix\r\nlayer, besides nerves, tracheæ, and blood, contain secretory vesicles\r\nfilled with uric-acid concretions such as occur in the fat-body of\r\nLampyris. There are also a great many glands varying much in structure\r\nand position, such occurring also in the pronotum (Fig. 139).\r\n\r\n  Meinert considers the elytra of Coleoptera to be the homologues of\r\n  the tegulæ of Lepidoptera and of Hymenoptera. He also calls\r\n  attention to the alula observed in Dyticus, situated at the base of\r\n  the elytra, but which is totally covered by the latter. The alulæ of\r\n  these beetles he regards as the homologues of the anterior wings of\r\n  Hymenoptera and Diptera. No details are given in support of these\r\n  views. (Ent. Tidskrift, i, 1880, p. 168.)\r\n\r\n  Hoffbauer (1892) also has suggested that the elytra are not the\r\n  homologues of the fore wings of other insects, but of the tegulæ.\r\n\r\n  Kolbe describes the alula of Dyticus as a delicate, membranous lobe\r\n  at the base of the elytra, but not visible when they are closed: its\r\n  fringed edge in Dyticus is bordered by a thickening forming a tube\r\n  which contains a fluid. The alula is united with the inner basal\r\n  portion and articulation of the wing-cover, forming a continuation\r\n  of them. Dufour considered that the humming noise made by these\r\n  beetles is produced by the alulets.\r\n\r\n  Hoffbauer finds no structural resemblances in the alulæ of Dyticus\r\n  to the elytra. He does not find “the least trace of veins.” They are\r\n  more like appendages of the elytra. Lacordaire considered that their\r\n  function is to prevent the disarticulation of the elytra, but\r\n  Hoffbauer thinks that they serve as contrivances to retain the air\r\n  which the beetle carries down with it under the surface, since he\r\n  almost always found a bubble of air concealed under it; besides,\r\n  their folded and fringed edge seems especially fitted for taking in\r\n  and retaining air. Hoffbauer then describes the tegulæ of the hornet\r\n  and finds them to be, not as Cholodkowsky states, hard, solid,\r\n  chitinous plates, but hollow. They are inserted immediately over the\r\n  base or insertion of the fore wings, being articulated by a\r\n  hinge-joint, the upper lamella extending into a cavity of the side\r\n  of the mesothorax, and connected by a hinge-like, articulating\r\n  membrane with the lower projection of the bag or cavity. The lower\r\n  lamella becomes thinner towards the place of insertion, is slightly\r\n  folded, and merges without any articulation into the thin, thoracic\r\n  wall at a point situated over the insertion of the fore wing. The\r\n  tegulæ also differ from the wings in having no muscles to move them,\r\n  the actual movements being of a passive nature, and due to the\r\n  upward and downward strokes of the wings.\r\n\r\n  Comstock adopts Meinert’s view that the elytra are not true fore\r\n  wings, but gives no reasons. (Manual, p. 495.)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Sharp,[25] however, after examining Dyticus and Cybister,\r\n  affirms that this structure is only a part of the elytron, to which\r\n  it is extensively attached, and that it corresponds with the angle\r\n  at the base of the wing seen in so many insects that fold their\r\n  front wings against the body. He does not think that the alula\r\n  affords any support to the view that the elytra of beetles\r\n  correspond with the tegulæ of Hymenoptera rather than with the fore\r\n  wings.\r\n\r\n  That the elytra are modified paraptera (tegulæ) is negatived by the\r\n  fact that the latter have no muscles, and that the elytra contain\r\n  tracheæ whose irregular arrangement may be part of the modified\r\n  degenerate structure of the elytra. Kolbe finds evidences of veins.\r\n  The question may also be settled by an examination of the structure\r\n  of the pupal wings. A study of a series of sections of both pairs of\r\n  wings of the pupa of Doryphora and of a Clytus convinces us that the\r\n  elytra are the homologues of the fore wings of other insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _e._ Development and mode of origin of the wings\r\n\r\n=Embryonic development of the wings.=—The wings of insects are\r\nessentially simple dorsal outgrowths of the integument, being\r\nevaginations of the hypodermis. They begin to form in the embryo before\r\nhatching, first appearing as folds, buds, or evaginations, of the\r\nhypodermis, which lie in pouches, called peripodal cavities. They are\r\nnot visible externally until rather late in larval life, after the\r\ninsect, such as a grasshopper, has moulted twice or more times; while in\r\nholometabolous insects they are not seen externally until the pupa state\r\nis attained.\r\n\r\nThe subject of their origin is in a less satisfactory state than\r\ndesirable from the fact that at the outset the development of the wings\r\nof the most generalized insects, such as Orthoptera, Termes, etc., was\r\nnot first examined, that of the most highly modified of any insects,\r\n_i.e._ the Muscidæ, having actually been first studied.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his embryological studies on the Muscidæ (_Musca\r\ncomitoria_ and _Sarcophaga carnaria_) Weismann (1864) in examining the\r\nlarvæ of these flies just before pupation, found that the wings, as well\r\nas the legs and mouth-appendages, developed from microscopic masses of\r\nindifferent cells, which he called “imaginal discs.” From the six\r\nimaginal discs or buds in the lower part of the thorax arise the legs,\r\nwhile from four dorsal discs, two in the meso- and two in the\r\nmetathoracic segment, arise the fore and hind wings (Fig. 141.) These\r\nimaginal buds, as we prefer to call these germs, usually appear at the\r\nclose of embryonic life, being found in freshly hatched larvæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 140.—Imaginal buds in Musca,—_A_, in Corethra,—_B_, in\r\n    Melophagus,—_C_, in embryo of Melophagus; dorsal view of the head;\r\n    _b_, bud; _p_, peripodal membrane; _c_, cord; _hy_, hypodermis;\r\n    _cl_, cuticula; _st_, stomodæum; _v_, ventral cephalic, behind are\r\n    the two dorsal cephalic buds.—After Pratt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs first observed by Weismann, the buds are, like those of the\r\nappendages, simply attached to tracheæ and sometimes to nerves, in the\r\nformer case appearing as minute folds or swellings of the peritoneal\r\nmembrane of certain of the tracheæ. In Volucella the imaginal buds were,\r\nhowever, found by Künckel d’Herculais to be in union with the\r\nhypodermis. Dewitz detected a delicate thread-like stalk connecting the\r\nperipodal membrane with the hypodermis, and Van Rees has since proved in\r\nMusca, and Pratt in Melophagus, the connection of the imaginal buds with\r\nthe hypodermis (Fig. 140). These tracheal enlargements increase in size,\r\nand become differentiated into a solid mass which corresponds to the\r\nupper part of the mesothorax, while a tongue-shaped continuation becomes\r\nthe rudiment of the wing. During larval life the rudiments of the wings\r\ncrumple, thus forming a cavity. While the larva is transforming into the\r\npupa, the sheath or peripodal membranes of the rudimentary wings are\r\ndrawn back, the blood presses in, and thus the wings are everted out of\r\nthe peripodal cavities.\r\n\r\n  Due credit, however, should be given to Herold, as the pioneer in\r\n  these studies, who first described in his excellent work on the\r\n  development of _Pieris brassicæ_ (1815) the wing-germs in the\r\n  caterpillar after the third moult. This discovery has been\r\n  overlooked by recent writers, with the exception of Gonin, whose\r\n  statement of Herold’s views we have verified. Herold states that the\r\n  germs of the wings appear on the inside of the second and third\r\n  thoracic segments, and are recognized by their attachment to the\r\n  “protoplasmic network” (_schleimnetz_), which we take to be the\r\n  hypodermis, the net-like appearance of this structure being due to\r\n  the cell-walls of the elements of the hypodermal membrane. These\r\n  germs are, says Herold, also distinguished from the flakes of the\r\n  fat-body by their regular symmetrical form. Fine tracheæ are\r\n  attached to the wing-germs, in the same way as to the flakes of the\r\n  fat-body. It thus appears that Herold in a vague way attributes the\r\n  origin of these wing-germs, and also the germs of the leg, to the\r\n  hypodermis, since his schleimnetz is the membrane which builds up\r\n  the new skin. Herold also studied the later development of the\r\n  wings, and discovered the mode of origin of the veins, and in a\r\n  vague way traced the origin of the scales and hairs of the body, as\r\n  well as that of the colors of the butterfly.\r\n\r\n  Herold also says that as the caterpillar grows larger, and also the\r\n  wing-germs, “the larval skin in the region under which they lie\r\n  hidden is spotted and swollen,” and he adds in a footnote: “This is\r\n  the case with all smooth caterpillars marked with bright colors. In\r\n  dark and hairy caterpillars the swelling of the skin through the\r\n  growth of the underlying wing-germs is less distinct or not visible\r\n  at all” (pp. 29, 30).\r\n\r\n  It should be added that Malpighi, Swammerdam, and also Réaumur had\r\n  detected the rudiments of the wings in the caterpillar just before\r\n  pupation under the old larval skin. Lyonet (1760) also describes and\r\n  figures the four wing-germs situated in the second and third\r\n  thoracic segments, but was uncertain as to their nature. Each of\r\n  these masses, he says, is “situated in the fatty body without being\r\n  united to it, and is attached to the skin in a deep fold which it\r\n  makes there.” He could throw no certain light on their nature, but\r\n  says: “their number and situation leads to the supposition that they\r\n  may be the rudiments of the wings of the moth” (pp. 449, 450).\r\n\r\nDuring the transformation into the pupa the imaginal buds unite and grow\r\nout or extend along their edges, while the enveloping membrane\r\ndisappears. The rudimentary wings are now like little sacs, and soon\r\nshow a fusion of the two wing-membranes or laminæ with the veins, while\r\nthe tracheæ disappear, the places occupied by the tracheæ becoming the\r\nveins. “Very early, as soon as the scales are indicated, begin in a very\r\npeculiar way the fusion of the wing-laminæ. There occur openings in the\r\nhypodermis into which the cells extend longitudinally and then laterally\r\ngive way to each other. Hence no complete opening is found, but the\r\nepithelium appears by sections through a straight line sharply bordered\r\nalong the wingcavity. It is a continuous membrane formed of plasma which\r\nI will call the ground membrane of the epithelium. Through this ground\r\nmembrane pass blood-corpuscles as well as blood-lymph.” (Schaeffer.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 141.—Anterior part of young larva of _Simulium sericea_, showing\r\n    the thoracic imaginal buds: _p_, prothoracic bud (only one not\r\n    embryonic); _w_, _w′_, fore and hind wing-buds; _l_, _l′_, _l″_,\r\n    leg-buds; _n_, nervous system; _br_, brain; _e_, eye; _sd_, salivary\r\n    duct; _p_, prothoracic foot.—After Weismann.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfterwards (1866) Weismann studied the development of the wings in\r\n_Corethra plumicornis_, which is a much more primitive and generalized\r\nform than Musca, and in which the process of development of the wings is\r\nmuch simpler, and, as since discovered, more as in other holometabolous\r\ninsects. He also examined those of Simulium (Fig. 141).\r\n\r\n  In Corethra, after the fourth and last larval moulting, there arises\r\n  at first by evagination and afterwards by invagination a cup-shaped\r\n  depression on each side in the upper part of the mesothoracic\r\n  segment within which the rudiment of the wings lies like a plug. The\r\n  wings without other change simply increase in size until, in the\r\n  transformation into the pupa by the withdrawal of the hypodermis,\r\n  the wings project out and become filled with blood, the tracheæ now\r\n  being wholly wanting, and other tissues being sparingly present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 142.—Section through thorax of a Tineid larva on sycamore,\r\n    passing through the 1st pair of wings (_w_): _ht_, heart; _i_,\r\n    œsophagus; _s_, salivary gland: _ut_, urinary tube; _nc_, nervous\r\n    cord; _m_, recti muscles; a part of the fat body overlies the heart.\r\n    _A_, right wing-germ enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  These observations on two widely separate groups of Diptera were\r\n  confirmed by Landois, and afterwards by Pancritius, for the\r\n  Lepidoptera, by Ganin for the Hymenoptera, by Dewitz for Hymenoptera\r\n  (ants) and Trichoptera; also for the Neuroptera by Pancritius. In\r\n  the ant-lion (_Myrmeleon formicarius_) Pancritius found no rudiments\r\n  of the wings in larvæ a year old, but they were detected in the\r\n  second year of larval life, and do not differ much histologically or\r\n  in shape from those of Lepidoptera. In the Coleoptera and\r\n  Hymenoptera the imaginal buds appear rather late in larval life, yet\r\n  their structure is like that of Lepidoptera. In Cimbex the rudiments\r\n  of the wings are not found in the young larva, but are seen in the\r\n  semipupa, which stage lasts over six weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 143.—Section of the same specimen as in Fig. 142, but cut through\r\n    the second pair of wings (_w_): _i_, mid-intestine; _h_, heart;\r\n    _fb_, fat-body; _l_, leg; _n_, nervous cord.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general relation of the rudiments (imaginal buds) of the wings of a\r\ntineid moth to the rest of the body near the end of larval life may be\r\nseen in Figs. 142, 143 (Tinea?), the sections not, however, showing\r\ntheir connection with the hypodermis, which has been torn away during\r\nthe process of cutting. That the wing is but a fold of the hypodermis is\r\nwell seen in Fig. 144, of Datana, which represents a much later stage of\r\ndevelopment than in Figs. 142 and 143, the larva just entering on the\r\nsemipupa stage.\r\n\r\nIn caterpillars of stage I, 3 to 4 mm. in length, Gonin found the\r\nwing-germs as in Fig. 145, _A_ being a thickening of the hypodermis,\r\nwith the embryonic cells, _i.e._ of Verson, on the convex border. The\r\ntwo leaves, or sides of the wing, begin to differentiate in stage II\r\n(_C_, _D_), and in stage III the envelope is formed (_E_), while the\r\ntracheæ begin to proliferate, and the capillary tracheæ or tracheoles at\r\nthis time arise (Fig. 145, _tc_). The wall of the principal trachea\r\nappears to be resolved into filaments, and all the secondary branches\r\nassume the appearance of bundles of twine. Landois regarded them as the\r\nproduct of a transformation of the nuclei, but Gonin thinks they arise\r\nfrom the entire cells, stating that from each cell arises a ball\r\n(peloton) of small twisted tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 144.—Section through mesothoracic segment of _Datana ministra_,\r\n    passing through the wings (_w_): _c_, cuticula; _hyp_, hypodermis:\r\n    _ap_, apodeme; _dm_, dorsal longitudinal.—_vm_, ventral\r\n    longitudinal. muscles; _dmt_, depressor muscle of tergum; _t_,\r\n    trachea; _n_, nerve cords; _i_, intestine; _u_, urinary tubes; _l_,\r\n    insertion of legs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs the large branches penetrate into the wing, the balls (pelotons) of\r\nfine tracheal threads tend to unroll, and each of the new ramifications\r\nof the secondary tracheal system is accompanied in its course by a\r\nbundle of capillary tubes. This secondary system of wing-tracheæ, then,\r\narises from the mother trachea at the end of the third stage, when we\r\nfind already formed the chitinous tunic, which will persist through the\r\nfourth stage up to pupation. It differs from the tracheoles in not\r\ncommunicating with the air-passage; it possesses no spiral membrane at\r\nthe origin, and takes no part in respiration.\r\n\r\nGonin thus sums up the nature of the two tracheal systems in the\r\nrudimentary wing, which he calls the provisional and permanent systems.\r\n“The first, appearing in the second stage of the larva, comprises all\r\nthe capillary tubes, and arising from numerous branches passes off from\r\nthe lateral trunk of the thorax before reaching the wing; the second is\r\nformed a little later by the direct ramification of the principal\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n“These two systems are absolutely independent of each other within the\r\nwing. Their existence is simultaneous but not conjoint. One is\r\nfunctionally active after the third moult; the other waits the final\r\ntransformation before becoming active.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 145.—_A_, section of wing-bud of larva of _Pieris brassicæ_ of\r\n    stage I, in front of the invagination pit. _B_, section passing\r\n    through the invagination pit. _C_, section of same in stage II,\r\n    through the invagination pit;—_D_, behind it, making the bud appear\r\n    independent of the thoracic wall. _E_, wing-bud at the beginning of\r\n    the 3d larval stage, section passing almost through the pedicel or\r\n    hypodermic insertion, the traces of which appear at _hi_; _h_,\r\n    hypodermis; _t_ or _tr_, trachea; _i_, opening of invagination;\r\n    _ec_, embryonic cells; _l_, external layer or envelope; _in_,\r\n    internal wall of the wing; _ex_, external wall; _s_, cell of a\r\n    tactile hair; _tc_, capillary tubes; _c_, cavity of\r\n    invagination.—After Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Evagination of the wing outside of the body.=—We have seen that the\r\nalary germs arise as invaginations of the hypodermis; we will now, with\r\nthe aid of Gonin’s account, briefly describe, so far as is known, the\r\nmode of evagination of the wings. During the fourth and last stage of\r\nthe caterpillar of Pieris, the wings grow very rapidly, and undergo\r\nimportant changes.\r\n\r\nSix or seven days after the last larval moult the chitinous wall is\r\nformed, the wing remaining transparent. It grows rapidly and its lower\r\nedge extends near the legs. It is now much crumpled on the edge, owing\r\nto its rapid growth within the limits of its own segment. Partly from\r\nbeing somewhat retracted, and partly owing to the irregularity of its\r\nsurface, the wing gradually separates from its envelope, and the cavity\r\nof invagination (Fig. 145, _c_) becomes more like a distinct or real\r\nspace. The outer opening of the alary sac enlarges quite plainly, though\r\nwithout reaching the level of the edge of the wing.\r\n\r\nThis condition of things does not still exactly explain how the wing\r\npasses to the outside of the body. Gonin compares these conditions to\r\nthose exhibited by a series of sections of the larva, made forty-eight\r\nhours later, on a caterpillar which had just spun its girdle of silk. At\r\nthis time the wings have become entirely external, but, says Gonin, we\r\ndo not see the why or the how. The partition of the sac has disappeared,\r\nand with it the cavity and the leaf of the envelope.\r\n\r\n  It appears probable that the partition has been destroyed, because\r\n  the space between the two teguments is strewn with numerous bits,\r\n  many of which adhere to the chitinous integument, while others are\r\n  scattered along the edges of the wings, in their folds, or between\r\n  the wings and the wall of the thorax.\r\n\r\n  Another series of sections showed that the exit of the fore wings\r\n  had been accomplished, while the hinder pair was undergoing the\r\n  process of eversion. In this case the partition showed signs of\r\n  degeneration: deformation of the nuclei, indistinct cellular limits,\r\n  pigmentation, granular leucocytes, and fatty globules.\r\n\r\n  After the destruction of the partition, what remains of the layer of\r\n  the envelope is destined to make a part of the thoracic wall and\r\n  undergoes for this purpose a superficial desquamation. The layer of\r\n  flattened cells is removed and replaced by a firmer epithelium like\r\n  that covering the other regions. It is this renewed hypodermis which\r\n  conceals the wing within, serves to separate it from the cavity of\r\n  the body, and gives the illusion of a complete change in its\r\n  situation. Other changes occur, all forming a complete regeneration,\r\n  but which does not accord with the description of Van Rees for the\r\n  Muscidæ. Finally, Gonin concludes that the débris scattered about\r\n  the wing comes from the two layers of the partition of the sac, from\r\n  the flattened hypodermis of the renewed envelope, from the chitinous\r\n  cuticle of the wing, and from the inner surface of the chitinous\r\n  integument.\r\n\r\n  He thinks that the metamorphosis of Pieris is intermediate between\r\n  the two types of Corethra and of Musca, established by Weismann, as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  =Corethra.=—The wing is formed in a simple depression of the\r\n  hypodermic wall. No destruction.\r\n\r\n  =Pieris.=—The rudiment is concealed in a sac attached to the\r\n  hypodermis by a short pedicel. Destruction of the partition and its\r\n  replacement by a part of the thoracic wall by means of the imaginal\r\n  epithelium.\r\n\r\n  =Musca.=—The pedicel is represented by a cord of variable length,\r\n  whose cavity may be obliterated (Van Rees). The imaginal hypodermis\r\n  is substituted for the larval hypodermis, which has completely\r\n  disappeared, either by desquamation (Viallanes), or by histolytic\r\n  resorption (Van Rees).\r\n\r\n=Extension of the wing; drawing out of the tracheoles.=—When it is\r\ndisengaged from the cavity, the wing greatly elongates and the creases\r\non its surface are smoothed out; the blood penetrates between the two\r\nwalls, and the cellular fibres, before relaxed and sinuous, are now\r\nfirmly extended.\r\n\r\nOf the two tracheal systems, the large branches are sinuous, and they\r\nare rendered more distinct by the presence of a spiral membrane; but the\r\ntwo tunics are not separated as in the other tracheæ of the thorax;\r\nmoreover, the mouth choked up with débris does not yet communicate with\r\nthat of the principal trunk. The bundles of tracheoles on their part\r\nform straight lines, as if the folds of the organ had had no influence\r\non them. As they have remained bound together, apart from the chitinous\r\nmembrane of the tracheal trunk, they become drawn out with this\r\nmembrane, at the time of exuviation, _i.e._ of pupation, and are drawn\r\nout of the neighboring spiracle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 146.—Full-grown larva of _Pieris brassicæ_, opened along the\r\n    dorsal line: _d_, digestive canal; _s_, silk-gland; _g_, brain; _st\r\n    I_, prothoracic stigma; _st IV_, 1st abdominal stigma; _a_, _a′_,\r\n    germs (buds) of fore and hind wings; _p_, bud of prothoracic\r\n    segment;—those of the third pair are concealed under the\r\n    silk-glands; _I–III_, thoracic rings.—After Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “This is a very curious phenomenon, which can be verified\r\n  experimentally: if we cut off the wing, while sparing the larval\r\n  integument around the thoracic spiracles, we preserve the two\r\n  tracheal systems; the same operation performed after complete\r\n  removal of the larval skin does not give the secondary tracheal\r\n  system.” (Gonin.) Deceived by the appearance of the tracheoles while\r\n  still undeveloped, Landois and Pancritius, who have not mentioned\r\n  the drawing out of the capillaries of the larva, affirm that they\r\n  are destroyed by resorption in the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n  “The study of the tracheæ is closely connected with that of the\r\n  veins (nervures). It is well to guard against the error of Verson,\r\n  who mistakes for these last the large tracheal branches of the wing.\r\n  This confusion is easily explained; it proves that Verson had, with\r\n  us, recognized that the secondary system is, in the larva, exempt\r\n  from all respiratory function. Landois thought that the pupal period\r\n  was the time of formation of the veins. It seems to me probable that\r\n  they are derived from the sheath of the peritracheal spaces.”\r\n  (Gonin, pp. 30–33.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147.—Left anterior wing of a larva 3 days before pupation.

G. Mayer has examined the late development of the wings in _Pieris\r\nrapæ_. Fig. 149 represents a frontal section through the left wing of a\r\nmature larva and shows the rudiment of the wing, lying in its hypodermal\r\npocket or peripodal cavity. How the trachea passes into the rudimentary\r\nwing, and eventually becomes divided into the branches, around which the\r\nmain veins afterwards form, is seen in Figs. 144, 147, 159.\r\n\r\nThe histological condition of the wing at this time is represented by\r\nFig. 151, the spindle-like hypodermal cells forming the two walls being\r\nseparated by the ground-membrane of Semper.\r\n\r\n“While in the pupa state,” says Mayer, “the wing-membrane is thrown into\r\na very regular series of closely compressed folds, a single scale being\r\ninserted upon the crest of each fold. When the butterfly issues from the\r\nchrysalis, these folds in the pupal wings flatten out, and it is this\r\nflattening which causes the expansion of the wings.... It is evident\r\nthat the wings after emergence undergo a great stretching and\r\nflattening. The mechanics of the operation appears to be as follows. The\r\nhæmolymph, or blood, within the wings is under considerable pressure,\r\nand this pressure would naturally tend to enlarge the freshly emerged\r\nwing into a balloon-shaped bag; but the hypodermal fibres (_h_) hold the\r\nupper and lower walls of the wing-membrane closely together, and so,\r\ninstead of becoming a swollen bag, the wing becomes a thin flat one. And\r\nthus it is that the little thick corrugated sac-like wings of the\r\nfreshly emerged insect become the large, thin, flat wings of the\r\nimago.... The area of the wing of the imago of _Danais plexippus_ is 8.6\r\ntimes that of the pupa. Now, as the wing of the young pupa has about 60\r\ntimes the area of the wing in the mature larva, it is evident that in\r\npassing from the larval state to maturity the area of the wings\r\nincreases more than 500 times.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 150.—Diagrammatic reproduction of Fig. 149 showing the wing-germ\r\n    in its peripodal cavity (_p_): _h’drm_, hypodermis; _tr_, trachea;\r\n    _cta_, cuticula; _a_, anterior end.—After Mayer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 151.—Section of the wing-germ, the upper and lower sides\r\n    connected by spindle-like hypodermic cells (_h_), forming the rods\r\n    of the adult wing; _mbr_, ground-membrane of Semper.—After Mayer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _f._ The primitive origin of the wings\r\n\r\nFarther observations are needed to connect the mode of formation of the\r\nwings in the holometabolous insects with the more primitive mode of\r\norigin seen in the hemimetabolous orders, but the former mode is\r\nevidently inherited from the latter. Pancritius remarks that the\r\ndevelopment of the rudiments of the wing in a hypodermal cavity is in\r\nthe holometabolic insects to be regarded as a later inherited character,\r\nthe external conditions causing it being unknown.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller was the first to investigate the mode of development of the\r\nwings of the hemimetabolic insects, examining the young nymphs of\r\nTermites. He regards the wings as evaginations of the hypodermis, which\r\nexternally appear as thoracic scale-like projections, into which enter\r\nrather late in nymphal life tracheæ which correspond to the veins which\r\nafterward arise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 152.—Rudimentary wing of young nymph of Blatta, with the five\r\n    principal veins developed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe primitive mode of origin of the wings may, therefore, be best\r\nunderstood by observing the early stages of those insects, such as the\r\nOrthoptera and Hemiptera, which have an incomplete metamorphosis. If the\r\nstudent will examine the nymphs of any locust in their successive\r\nstages, he will see that the wings arise as simple expansions downward\r\nand backward of the lateral edges of the meso- and metanotum. In the\r\nsecond nymphal stage this change begins to take place, but it does not\r\nbecome marked until the succeeding stage, when the indications of veins\r\nbegin to appear, and the lobe-like expansion of the notum is plainly\r\nenough a rudimentary wing.\r\n\r\nGraber[26] thus describes the mode of development of the wings in the\r\nnymph of the cockroach:\r\n\r\n  “If one is looking only at the exterior of the process, he will\r\n  perceive sooner or later on the sides of the meso- and metathorax\r\n  pouch-like sacs, which increase in extent with the dorsal integument\r\n  and at the same time are more and more separated from the body.\r\n  These wing-covers either keep the same position as in the\r\n  flat-bodied Blattidæ, or in insects with bodies more compressed the\r\n  first rudiments hang down over the sides of the thorax. As soon as\r\n  they have exceeded a certain length, these wing-covers are laid over\r\n  on the back. However, if we study the process of development of the\r\n  wings with a microscope, by means of sections made obliquely through\r\n  the thorax, the process appears still more simple. The chief force\r\n  of all evolution is and remains the power of growth in a definite\r\n  direction. In regard to the skin this growth is possible in insects\r\n  only in this way; namely, that the outer layer of cells is increased\r\n  by the folds which are forced into the superficial chitinous skin.\r\n  These folds naturally grow from one moult to another in proportion\r\n  to the multiplication of the cells, and are not smoothed out until\r\n  after the moulting, when the outer resistance is overcome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 153.—Partial metamorphosis of _Melanoplus femur-rubrum_,\r\n    showing the five nymph stages, and the gradual growth of the\r\n    wings, which are first visible externally in 3, 3_b_,\r\n    3_c_.—Emerton _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “As, however, the first wing-layers depend upon the wrinkling of the\r\n  general integument of the body through the increase in the upper\r\n  layer, the further growth of the wings depends in the later stages\r\n  upon the wrinkling of the epidermis of the wing-membrane even, which\r\n  fact we also observe under the microscope when the new wings drawn\r\n  forth from the old covers appear at first to be quite creased\r\n  together. These wing-like wrinkles in the skin are not empty\r\n  pouches, but contain tissues and organs within, which are connected\r\n  with the skin, as the fat of the body, the network of tracheæ,\r\n  muscles, etc. Alongside the tracheæ, running through the former\r\n  wing-pouches and accompanied by the nerves, there are canals through\r\n  which the blood flows in and out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 154.—Stages in the growth of the wings of the nymph of _Termes\r\n    flavipes_: _A_, young; _a_, a wing enlarged. _B_, older nymph;\r\n    _b_, fore wing; _n_, a vein. _C_, wings more advanced;—_D_,\r\n    mature.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 155.—Wings of nymph of Psocus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “After the last moult, however, when the supply of moisture is very\r\n  much reduced in the wing-pouches, which are contracted at the\r\n  bottom, their two layers become closely united, and afterward grow\r\n  into one single, solid wing-membrane.\r\n\r\n  “These thick-walled blood-tubes arising above and beneath the upper\r\n  and lower membrane of the wing are the veins of the wings; the\r\n  development of the creased wings in the pupa of butterflies is\r\n  exactly like that of cockroaches and bugs. The difference is only\r\n  that the folds of integument furnishing the wings with an ample\r\n  store of material for their construction reach in a relatively\r\n  shorter time, that is the space of time between two moults, the same\r\n  extent that they would otherwise attain only in the course of\r\n  several periods of growth in the ametabolous insects.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 156.—Nymph of _Aphrophora permutata_, with enlarged view of the\r\n    wings and the veins: _pro_, pronotum; _sc_, mesoscutum; 1_ab_, 1st\r\n    abdominal segment.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIgnorant of Graber’s paper, we had arrived at the same result, after an\r\nexamination of the early nymph-stages of the cockroach, as well as the\r\nlocusts, Termites, and various Hemiptera. In all these forms it is\r\nplainly to be seen that the wings are simply expansions, either\r\nhorizontal or partly vertical (where, as in locusts, etc., the body is\r\ncompressed, and the meso- and metanota are rounded downwards), of the\r\nhinder and outer edge of the meso- and metanotum. As will be seen by\r\nreference to the accompanying figures, the wings are notal (tergal)\r\noutgrowths from the dorsal arch of the two hinder segments of the\r\nthorax. At first, as seen in the young pupal cockroach (Fig. 152) and\r\nlocust (Fig. 153, also Figs. 154 and 156) the rudiments of the wings are\r\ncontinuous with the notum. Late in nymphal life a suture and a\r\nhinge-joint appear at the base of the wing, and thus there is some\r\nmovement of the wing upon the notum; finally, the tracheæ are well\r\ndeveloped in the wings, and numerous small sclerites are differentiated\r\nat the base of the wing, to which the special muscles of flight are\r\nattached, and thus the wings, after the last nymphal moult, have the\r\npower of flapping, and of sustaining the insect in the air; they thus\r\nbecome true organs of flight.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, then, that the wings in all hemimetabolous insects\r\nare outgrowths from the notum, and not from the flanks or pleurum of the\r\nthorax. There is, then, no structure in any other part of the body with\r\nwhich they are homologous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 157.—Development of wings of Trichoptera: _A_, portion of\r\n    body-wall of young larva of Trichostegia; _ch_, cuticula, forming at\r\n    _r_ a projection into the hypodermis, _m_; _r_, and _d_, forming\r\n    thus the first rudiment of the wing. _B_, the parts in a larva of\r\n    nearly full size; _a_, _c_, _d_, _b_, the well-developed hypodermis\r\n    of the wing-germ separated into two parts by _r_, the penetrating\r\n    extension of the cuticula; _v_, mesoderm, _C_, wing-pad of another\r\n    Phryganeid freed from its case at its change to the pupa: _b_, _d_,\r\n    outer layer of the hypodermis (_m_) of the body-wall; _v_, inner\r\n    layer within nuclei.—After Dewitz, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the true Neuroptera, Trichoptera (Fig. 157), the\r\nColeoptera, and the Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. As we have\r\nobserved in the house fly,[27] the wings are evidently outgrowths of the\r\nmeso- and metanotum; we have also observed this to be most probably the\r\ncase in the Lepidoptera, from observations on a Tortrix in different\r\nstages of metamorphosis. It is also the case with the Hymenoptera, as we\r\nhave observed in bees and wasps;[28] and in these forms, and probably\r\nall Hymenoptera, the wings are outgrowths of the scutal region of the\r\nnotum.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before us we may speculate as to the probable origin of\r\nthe wings of insects. The views held by some are those of Gegenbaur,\r\nalso adopted by Lubbock, and originally by myself.[29] According to\r\nGegenbaur:\r\n\r\n  “The wings must be regarded as homologous with the lamellar tracheal\r\n  gills, for they do not only agree with them in origin, but also in\r\n  their connection with the body, and in structure. In being limited\r\n  to the second and third thoracic segments they point to a reduction\r\n  in the number of the tracheal gills. It is quite clear that we must\r\n  suppose that the wings did not arise as such, but were developed\r\n  from organs which had another function, such as the tracheal gills;\r\n  I mean to say that such a supposition is necessary, for we cannot\r\n  imagine that the wings functioned as such in the lower stages of\r\n  their development, and that they could have been developed by having\r\n  such a function.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 158.—Changes in external form of the young larva of _Calotermes\r\n    rugosus_, showing, in _A_ and _B_, the mode of origin of the\r\n    wing-pads: _A_, newly hatched, with 9 antennal joints, × 8. _B_,\r\n    older larva, with 10 joints, × 8. _C_, next stage, with 11 joints, ×\r\n    8. _D_, larva, with twelve joints; the position of the parts of the\r\n    alimentary canal are shown: _v_, crop; _m_, stomach; _b_, “paunch”;\r\n    _e_, intestine; _r_, heart, × 16⁄3.—After Fritz Müller, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf we examine the tracheal gills of the smaller dragon-fly (Agrion), or\r\nthe May-flies, or Sialidæ, or Perlidæ, or Phryganeidæ, we see that they\r\nare developed in a very arbitrary way, either at the end of the abdomen,\r\nor on the sternum, or from the pleurum; moreover, in structure they\r\ninvariably have but a single trachea, from which minute twigs branch\r\nout;[30] in the wings there are five or six main tracheæ, which give\r\nrise to the veins. Thus, in themselves, irrespective of their position,\r\nthey are not the homologues of the gills. The latter are only developed\r\nin the aquatic representatives of the Neuroptera and Pseudoneuroptera,\r\nand are evidently adaptive, secondary, temporary organs, and are in no\r\nsense ancestral, primitive structures from which the wings were\r\ndeveloped. There is no good reason to suppose that the aquatic Odonata\r\nor Ephemerids or Neuroptera were not descendants of terrestrial forms.\r\n\r\nTo these results we had arrived by a review of the above-mentioned\r\nfacts, before meeting with Fritz Müller’s opinions, derived from a study\r\nof the development of the wings of Calotermes (Fig. 158). Müller[31]\r\nstates that “(1) The wings of insects have not originated from ‘tracheal\r\ngills.’ The wing-shaped continuations of the youngest larvæ are in fact\r\nthe only parts in which air tubes are completely wanting, while tracheæ\r\nare richly developed in all other parts of the body.[32] (2) The wings\r\nof insects have arisen from lateral continuations of the dorsal plates\r\nof the body-segments with which they are connected.”\r\n\r\n  Now, speculating on the primary origin of wings, we need not suppose\r\n  that they originated in any aquatic form, but in some ancestral land\r\n  insect related to existing cockroaches and Termes. We may imagine\r\n  that the tergites (or notum) of the two hinder segments of the\r\n  thorax grew out laterally in some leaping and running insect; that\r\n  the expansion became of use in aiding to support the body in its\r\n  longer leaps, somewhat as the lateral expansions of the body aid the\r\n  flying squirrel or certain lizards in supporting the body during\r\n  their leaps. By natural selection these structures would be\r\n  transmitted in an improved condition until they became flexible,\r\n  _i.e._ attached by a rude hinge-joint to the tergal plates of the\r\n  meso- and metathorax. Then by continued use and attempts at flight\r\n  they would grow larger, until they would become permanent organs,\r\n  though still rudimentary, as in many existing Orthoptera, such as\r\n  certain Blattariæ and Pezotettix. By this time a fold or hinge\r\n  having been established, small chitinous pieces enclosed in membrane\r\n  would appear, until we should have a hinge flexible enough to allow\r\n  the wing to be folded on the back, and also to have a flapping\r\n  motion. A stray tracheal twig would naturally press or grow into the\r\n  base of the new structure. After the trachea running towards the\r\n  base of the wing had begun to send off branches into the rudimentary\r\n  structure, the number and direction of the future veins would become\r\n  determined on simple mechanical principles. The rudimentary\r\n  structures beating the air would need to be strengthened on the\r\n  front or costal edge. Here, then, would be developed the larger\r\n  number of main veins, two or three close together, and parallel.\r\n  These would be the costal, subcostal, and median veins. They would\r\n  throw out branches to strengthen the costal edge, while the branches\r\n  sent out to the outer and hinder edges of the wings might be less\r\n  numerous and farther apart. The net-veined wings of Orthoptera and\r\n  Pseudoneuroptera, as compared with the wings of Hymenoptera, show\r\n  that the wings of net-veined insects were largely used for\r\n  respiration as well as for flight, while in beetles and bees the\r\n  leading function is flight, that of respiration being quite\r\n  subordinate. The blood would then supply the parts, and thus\r\n  respiration or aëration of the blood would be demanded. As soon as\r\n  such expansions would be of even slight use to the insect as\r\n  breathing organs, the question as to their permanency would be\r\n  settled. Organs so useful both for flight and aëration of the blood\r\n  would be still further developed, until they would become permanent\r\n  structures, genuine wings. They would thus be readily transmitted,\r\n  and being of more use in adult life during the season of\r\n  reproduction, they would be still further developed, and thus those\r\n  insects which could fly the best, _i.e._ which had the strongest\r\n  wings, would be most successful in the struggle for existence. Thus\r\n  also, not being so much needed in larval life before the\r\n  reproductive organs are developed, they would not be transmitted\r\n  except in a very rudimentary way, as perhaps masses of internal\r\n  indifferent cells (imaginal discs), to the larva, being the rather\r\n  destined to develop late in larval and in pupal life. Thus the\r\n  development of the wings and of the generative organs would go hand\r\n  in hand, and become organs of adult life.[33]\r\n\r\n=The development and structure of the tracheæ and veins of the\r\nwing.=—The so-called veins (“nervures”) originate from fine tracheal\r\ntwigs which pass into the imaginal discs. A single longitudinal trachea\r\ngrows down into the wing-germ (Fig. 147), this branch arising through\r\nsimple budding of the large body-trachea passing under the rudiment of\r\nthe wing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 159.—Germ of a hind wing detached from its insertion, and\r\n    examined in glycerine: _i_, pedicel of insertion to the hypodermis;\r\n    _tr_, trachea; _b_, semicircular pad; _e_, enveloping membrane; _c_,\r\n    bundle of capillary tracheoles; the large tracheæ of the wing not\r\n    visible; they follow the course of the bundles of tracheoles.—After\r\n    Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGonin states that before the tracheæ reach the wing they divide into a\r\ngreat number of capillary tubes united into bundles and often tangled.\r\nThis mass of tracheæ does not penetrate into the wing-germ by one of its\r\nfree ends, but spreading over about a third of the surface of the wing,\r\nseparates into a dozen bundles which spread out fan-like in the interior\r\nof the wing. (Fig. 159). These ramifications, as seen under the\r\nmicroscope, are very irregular; they form here and there knots and\r\nanastomoses. They end abruptly in tufts at a little distance from the\r\nedge of the wing. A raised semicircular ridge (_b_) surrounds the base\r\nof the wing, and within this the capillaries are formed, while on the\r\nother side they are covered by a cellular layer.\r\n\r\n  Landois, he says, noticed neither the pedicel of the insertion of\r\n  the wing (_i_) nor the ridge (_b_). Herold only states that the\r\n  tracheæ pass like roots into the wing. Landois believed that they\r\n  formed an integral part of it. Dewitz and Pancritius used sections\r\n  to determine their situation.\r\n\r\nFig. 160 will illustrate Landois’ views as to the origin of the tracheæ\r\nand veins. _A_ represents the germ of a hind wing attached to a trachea;\r\n_c_ the elongated cells, in which, as seen at _B_, _c_, a fine tangled\r\ntracheal thread (_t_) appears, seen to be magnified at _C_. The cell\r\nwalls break down, and the threads become those which pass through the\r\ncentre of the veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 160.—Origin of the wings and their veins.—After Landois.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 161.-Section of the “rib” of a vein: _c_, cord; _b_, twig.—After\r\n    Schaeffer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The wing-rods.=—Semper discovered in transverse sections of the wings,\r\nwhat he called _Flügelrippen_; one such rib accompanying the trachea in\r\neach vein. He did not discover its origin, and his description of it is\r\nsaid to be somewhat erroneous. Schaeffer has recently examined the\r\nstructure, remarking: “I have surely observed the connection of this\r\ncellular tube with the tracheæ. It is found in the base of the wing\r\nwhere the lumen of the tracheæ is much widened. I only describe the\r\nfully formed rib (_rippe_). In a cross-section it forms a usually\r\ncylindrical tube which is covered by a very thin chitinous intima which\r\nbears delicate twigs (Fig. 161). These twigs are analogous to the\r\nthickened ridge of the tracheal intima. I can see no connection between\r\nthe branches of the different twigs. Through the ribs (_rippen_) extend\r\na central cord (_c_) which shows in longitudinal section a clear\r\nlongitudinal streaking. Semper regarded it as a nerve. But the\r\nconnection of the tube with the trachea contradicts this view. I can\r\nonly regard the cord as a separation-product of the cells of the walls.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 162.—Parts of a vein of the cockroach, showing the nerve (_n_) by\r\n    the side of the trachea (_tr_); _c_, blood-corpuscles.—After\r\n    Moseley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Other histological elements.=—These are the blood-lymph, corpuscles,\r\nblood-building masses, and nerves. Schaeffer states that in the immature\r\npupal wings we find besides the large tracheæ, which are more or less\r\nbranched, and in the wing-veins at a later period, blood-corpuscles\r\nwhich are more or less gorged with nutritive material, and also the\r\n“balls of granules” of Weismann, which are perhaps the “single fat-body\r\ncells” detected by Semper. Schaeffer also states that into the\r\nhypodermal fold of the rudiments of the wings pass peculiar formations\r\nof the fat-body and tracheal system, and connected with the fat-body are\r\nmasses of small cells which by Schaeffer are regarded as blood-building\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nFine nerves have also been detected within the veins, Moseley stating\r\nthat a nerve-fibre accompanies the trachea in all the larger veins in\r\nthe insects he has examined (Fig. 162), while it is present in\r\nMelolontha, where the trachea is absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LITERATURE ON THE WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Jurine, L.= Nouvelle méthode de classer les Hyménoptères et les\r\n    Dipterès.

He also refers to the experiments of Giraud which prove that\r\nthe insect needs for flight a rigid main-rib and a flexible membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 163.—The two upper lines are produced by the contacts of a\r\n    drone’s wing on a smoked cylinder. In the middle are recorded the\r\n    vibrations of a tuning-fork (250 vibrations per second) for\r\n    comparison with the frequency of the wing movements. Below are seen\r\n    the movements of the wing of a bee.—After Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf we take off the wing of an insect, and holding it by the small joint\r\nwhich connects it with the thorax, expose it to a current of air, we see\r\nthat the plane of the wing is inclined more and more as it is subjected\r\nto a more powerful impulse of the wind. The anterior nervure resists,\r\nbut the membranous portion which is prolonged behind bends on account of\r\nits greater pliancy.\r\n\r\nThe wings of insects may be regarded simply as vibrating wires, and\r\nhence the frequency of their movements can be calculated by the note\r\nproduced. Their movements can be recorded directly on a revolving\r\ncylinder, previously blackened with smoke, the slightest touch of the\r\ntip of the wing removing the black and exposing the white paper beneath;\r\nFig. 163 was obtained in this way. By this method it was calculated that\r\nin the common fly the wings made 330 strokes per second, the bee 190,\r\nthe Macroglossus 72, the dragon-fly 28, and the butterfly (_Pieris\r\nrapæ_) 9. Thus the smaller the species, the more rapid are the movements\r\nof the wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 164.—Appearance of a wasp flying in the sun: the extremity of the\r\n    wing is gilded.—After Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe path or trajectory made by the tip of the wing is like a figure 8.\r\nMarey obtained this by fastening a spangle of gold-leaf to the extremity\r\nof a wasp’s wing. The insect was then seized with a pair of forceps and\r\nheld in the sun in front of a dark background, the luminous trajectory\r\nshaping itself in the form of a lemniscate (Fig. 164).\r\n\r\n  To determine with accuracy the direction taken by the wing at\r\n  different stages of the trajectory, a small piece of capillary glass\r\n  tubing was blackened in the smoke of a candle, so that the slightest\r\n  touch on the glass was sufficient to remove the black coating and\r\n  show the direction of movement in each limb of the lemniscate. This\r\n  experiment was arranged as shown in Fig. 165. Different points on\r\n  the path of movement were tested by the smoked rod, and from the\r\n  track along which the black had been removed the direction of\r\n  movement was deduced. This direction is represented in the figure by\r\n  means of arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 165.—Experiment to test the direction of movement of an insect’s\r\n    wing: _a_, _a′_, _b_, _b′_, different positions of the smoked rod.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Theory of insect flight.=—“The theory of insect flight,” says Marey,\r\n“may be completely explained from the preceding experiments. The wing,\r\nin its to-and-fro movement, is bent in various directions by the\r\nresistance of the air. Its action is always that of an inclined plane\r\nstriking against a fluid and utilizing that part of the resistance which\r\nis favorable to its onward progression.\r\n\r\n“This mechanism is the same as that of a waterman’s scull, which as it\r\nmoves backwards and forwards is obliquely inclined in opposite\r\ndirections, each time communicating an impulse to the boat.”\r\n\r\nThe mechanism in the case of the insect’s wing is far simpler, however,\r\nthan in the process of sculling, since “the flexible membrane which\r\nconstitutes the anterior part of the wing presents a rigid border, which\r\nenables the wing to incline itself at the most favorable angle.”\r\n\r\n“The muscles only maintain the to-and-fro movement, the resistance of\r\nthe air does the rest, namely, effects those changes in surface\r\nobliquity which determine the formation of an 8–shaped trajectory by the\r\nextremity of the wing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 166.—Bee flying about in the chamber of the apparatus.—After\r\n    Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Lendenfeld has applied photography to determine the position of the\r\n  wings of a dragon-fly, and Marey has carried chronophotography\r\n  farther to indicate the normal trajectory of the wing, and to show\r\n  the position in flight. Fig. 166 shows a bee in various phases of\r\n  flight. “The insect sometimes assumes almost a horizontal position,\r\n  in which case the lower part of its body is much nearer the\r\n  object-glass than is its head, and yet both extremities are equally\r\n  well defined in the photograph. The successive images are separated\r\n  by an interval of 1⁄20 of a second (a long time when compared to the\r\n  total time occupied by a complete wing movement, _i.e._ 1⁄190 of a\r\n  second). And hence it is useless to attempt to gain a knowledge of\r\n  the successive phases of movement by examining the successive\r\n  photographs of a consecutive series representing an insect in\r\n  flight. Nevertheless an examination of isolated images affords\r\n  information of extreme interest with regard to the mechanism of\r\n  flight.\r\n\r\n  “We have seen that owing to the resistance of the air the expanse of\r\n  wing is distorted in various directions by atmospheric resistance.\r\n  Now, as the oscillations during flight are executed in a horizontal\r\n  plane, the obliquity of the wing-surface ought to diminish the\r\n  apparent breadth of the wing. This appearance can be seen in Fig.\r\n  167. There is here a comparison between two Tipulæ: the one in the\r\n  act of flight, the other perfectly motionless and resting against\r\n  the glass window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 167.—Illustration to show two Tipulæ, one of them remaining\r\n    motionless on the glass, and the other moving its limbs in\r\n    different directions, and setting its body at various\r\n    inclinations: the illustration only represents a small part of a\r\n    long series.—After Marey.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “The motionless insect maintains its wings in a position of vertical\r\n  extension; the plane is therefore at right angles to the axis of the\r\n  object-glass. The breadth of the wing can be seen in its entirety;\r\n  the nervures can be counted, and the rounding off of the extremities\r\n  of the wings is perfectly obvious. On the other hand, the flying\r\n  insect moves its wings in a horizontal direction, and owing to the\r\n  resistance of the air the expanse of the wings is obliquely\r\n  disposed, and only the projection of its surface can be seen in the\r\n  photograph. This is why the extremity of the wings appears as if it\r\n  were pointed, while the other parts look much narrower than normal.\r\n  The extent of the obliquity can be measured from the apparent\r\n  alteration in width, for the projection of this plane with the\r\n  vertical is the sine of the angle. From this it may be gathered that\r\n  the right wing (Fig. 168, third image) was inclined at an angle of\r\n  about 50° with the vertical, say 40° with the horizontal. This\r\n  inclination necessarily varies at different points of the trajectory\r\n  and must augment with the rapidity of movement; the obliquity\r\n  reaching its maximum in those portions of the wings which move with\r\n  the greatest velocity, namely, towards the extremities. The result\r\n  is that the wing becomes twisted at certain periods of the\r\n  movement.” (See the fourth image in Fig. 168.) The position of the\r\n  balancers seems to vary according to that of the wings. (Marey’s\r\n  Movement, pp. 253–257.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 168.—Tipula in the act of flying, showing the various attitudes\r\n    of the wings and the position of the balancers.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Graber’s views as to the mechanism of the wings, flight, etc.=—Although\r\nin reality insects possess but four wings, nature, says Graber,\r\nevidently endeavors to make them dipteral. This end is attained in a\r\ntwofold manner. In the butterflies, bees, and cicadas, the four wings\r\nnever act independently of each other, as two individual pairs, but they\r\nare always joined to a single flying plate by means of peculiar hooks,\r\nrows of claws, grooved clamps, and similar contrivances proceeding from\r\nthe modified edges of the wings; indeed, this connection is usually\r\ncarried so far that the hind wings are entirely taken in tow by the\r\nfront, and consequently possess a relatively weak mechanism of motion.\r\nThe other mode of wing reduction consists in the fact that one pair is\r\nthrown entirely out of employment. We observe this for instance in bugs,\r\nbeetles, grasshoppers, etc.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime, then, we may not trust to appearances. As their\r\n  development indeed teaches us, the wings as well as the additional\r\n  members must be regarded as actual evaginations of the common\r\n  sockets of the body, and in order especially to refute the prevalent\r\n  opinion that these wing-membranes are void of sensation, it should\r\n  be remembered that Leydig has proved the existence, as well as one\r\n  can be convinced by experiment, of a nerve-end apparatus in certain\r\n  basal or radical veins of the wing-membrane, which is very extensive\r\n  and complicated, and therefore indicates the performance of an\r\n  important function, perhaps of a kind of balancing sense, and also\r\n  that these same insect wings, with their delicate membrane, are very\r\n  easily affected by different outside agents, as, for instance,\r\n  warmth, currents of air, etc.\r\n\r\nUsually in their inactive or passive state the wings are held off\r\nhorizontally from the body during flight, and are laid upon the back\r\nagain when the insect alights; but an exception occurs in most\r\nbutterflies and Neuroptera, among which the wing-joint allows only one\r\nmovement round the oblique and long axis of the wings. From this cause,\r\ntoo, the insects just mentioned can unfold their wings suddenly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 169.—Anterior part of a Cicada for demonstrating the mechanism of\r\n    the articulation of the fore wing: _a_, articular head; _b_,\r\n    articular pan, frog, or cotyla; _g_, elastic band; _c_, _d_, _e_,\r\n    system of elastic rods; _r__{1}, _r__{2}, 1st and 2d abdominal\r\n    segments. _HF_, hind wings.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe transition of the wings from the active to the resting condition\r\nseems to be by way of a purely passive process, which, therefore,\r\nusually gives no trouble to the insect. The wing being extended by the\r\ntractive power of the muscles, flies back, when this ceases, to its\r\nformer or resting posture by means of its natural elasticity, like a\r\nspiral spring disturbed from its balance. The structure of this spring\r\njoint is very different, however.\r\n\r\n  It usually consists (Fig. 169) of two parts. The wing can move\r\n  itself up and down in a vertical plane by means of the forward\r\n  joint, and at the same time can rotate somewhat round its long axis,\r\n  because the chitinous part mentioned above is ground off after the\r\n  fashion of a mandrel.\r\n\r\n  The hinder joint, at a greater distance from the body, virtually\r\n  consists of a rounded piece (_a_) capitate towards the outside, and\r\n  of a prettily hollowed socket (_b_) formed by the union of the thick\r\n  ribs of the hind wings, which slides round the head joint when the\r\n  wings snap back upon the back. The mechanism which causes this\r\n  turning is, however, of a somewhat complicated nature. The most\r\n  instrumental part of it is the powerful elastic band (_g_) which is\r\n  stretched over from the hinder edge of the mesothorax (_R_{2}_)\r\n  towards that of the wings. This membrane is extended by the\r\n  expansion of the wings, and draws them towards the body as soon as\r\n  the contraction of the muscles relaxes. This closing band of the\r\n  wings is assisted by a leverage system consisting of three little\r\n  chitinous rods (_c_, _d_, _e_), which at its joining presses inwards\r\n  on the body on one side, and on the hinder edge and head-joint of\r\n  the wing on the other.\r\n\r\n  We must, however, lay great stress on a few more kinds of wing\r\n  support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 170.—Mesothoracic skeleton of a stag beetle: _schi_, scutellum,\r\n    on each side of which is the articulation of the fore wing (_V_),\r\n    consisting of two small styliform processes (_v_, _h_) of the base\r\n    of the wing; _za_, tooth which fits into the cavity of the\r\n    wing-lock (_gr_); _l_, edge of the right wing, passing into the\r\n    corresponding groove (_fa_) of the left; _Di_, diaphragm for the\r\n    attachment of the tergal muscle of the metasternum; _Di_{1}_ (not\r\n    explained by author); _Ka_, acetabulum of the coxa (_Hü_); _Se_,\r\n    chitinous process for the attachment of the coxal muscle; _Fe_,\r\n    femur; _Sch_, tibia; _B_{2}_, sternum.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The wing-cases of beetles at their return from flight are joined\r\n  together like the shells of a mussel on the inside as well as to the\r\n  wedge-shaped plate (Fig. 170, _schi_) between their bases. There is\r\n  even a kind of clasp at hand for this purpose. The base of the wing,\r\n  that is, bears a pair of tooth-like projections (_za_), which fit\r\n  into the corresponding hollows of the little plate.\r\n\r\n  The commissure arising from the joining of the inner edges is\r\n  characteristic. Usually the wings on both sides interlock by means\r\n  of a groove, as in stag-beetles, but sometimes even, as in Chlamys,\r\n  after the manner of two cog-wheels, so that we have here also an\r\n  imitation of the two most prevalent methods which the cabinet-maker\r\n  uses in joining boards together.\r\n\r\n  The act of folding the broad hind wings among beetles is not less\r\n  significant than the arrangement of the fore wing. If we forcibly\r\n  spread out the former in a beetle which has just been killed and\r\n  then leave it to its own resources again, we observe the following\r\n  result: According to its peculiar mode of joining, the costal vein\r\n  on the fore edge approaches the mid or discoidal vein of the basal\r\n  half as well as the distal half of the wing, whence arises a\r\n  longitudinal fold which curves in underneath. Then the distal half\r\n  snaps under like the blade of a pocket knife and lies on the plane\r\n  of the costal edge of the wing, while it also draws after it the\r\n  neighboring wing-area. The soft hinder-edge portion turns in\r\n  simultaneously when this wing-area remains fixed to the body while\r\n  the costal portion is moving towards the middle line of the body.\r\n\r\n  The wing-membranes of almost all insects have, moreover, the\r\n  capability of folding themselves somewhat, and this power of\r\n  extending or contracting the wing-membrane at will is of great\r\n  importance in flight.\r\n\r\n  Yes, but how is the folded wing spread out again? The fact may be\r\n  shown more simply and easily than one might suppose, and may be most\r\n  plainly demonstrated even to a larger public by making an artificial\r\n  wing exactly after the pattern of the natural one, in which bits of\r\n  whalebone may take the place of veins and a piece of india rubber\r\n  the membrane spread out between them. The reader will be patient\r\n  while we just explain to him the act of unfolding of the membranous\r\n  wing of the beetle. The actual impulse for this unfolding is due to\r\n  the flexor muscles which pull on, and at the same time somewhat\r\n  raise the vein on the costal edge. By this means the membranous fold\r\n  lying directly behind the costal vein is first spread out. But since\r\n  this fold is connected with the longitudinal fold of the distal end\r\n  of the wing which closes like a blade, the wing-area last mentioned\r\n  which is attached to the middle fold of the wing by the elastic\r\n  spring-like diagonal vein becomes stretched out. The hinder rayed\r\n  portion adjacent to the body is, on the other hand, simply drawn\r\n  along when the wing stands off from the body.\r\n\r\n  In order to properly grasp the mechanism of the insect wing we must\r\n  again examine its mode of articulation to the body somewhat more\r\n  accurately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 171.—Longitudinal section through a Tipula: _a_, mouth; _an_,\r\n    antenna; _k_{3}_, maxillary palpus; _ol_, labrum; _oG_, brain;\r\n    _uG_, subœsophageal ganglion; _BG_, thoracic ganglion; _schl_,\r\n    œsophagus; _mD_, digestive canal; _Ov_, ovary; _vF_, fore wing;\r\n    _sch_, halter; _lm_, longitudinal—_b-r_, lateral muscles.—After\r\n    Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  If we select the halteres of a garden gnat (Tipula) at the moment of\r\n  extension, we shall find them to be formed almost exactly after the\r\n  pattern of our oars, since the oblong oar-blade passes into a\r\n  longitudinal handle. The pedicel of the balancer is formed by the\r\n  thick longitudinal primary veins of the wing-membrane. This pedicel\r\n  (Fig. 171) is implanted in the side of the thorax in such a manner\r\n  that the wing may be compared to the top of a ninepin. One may\r\n  think, and on the whole it is actually the fact, that the stiff\r\n  pedicel of the wing is inserted in the thoracic wall, and that a\r\n  short portion of it (Fig. 172), projects into the cavity of the\r\n  thorax. It is true there is no actual hole to be found in the\r\n  thoracic wall, as the intermediate space between the base or pedicel\r\n  of the wing and the aperture in the thorax is lined with a thin\r\n  yielding membrane, on which the wing is suspended as on an\r\n  axle-tree. According to this, therefore, the insect wing, as well as\r\n  any other appendage of arthropods, acts as a lever with two arms.\r\n  The reader can then conjecture what may be the further mechanism of\r\n  the wing machine. We only need now two muscles diametrically opposed\r\n  to each other and seizing on the power arm of the wing, one of which\r\n  pulls down the short wing arm, thereby raising the oar, while the\r\n  other pulls up the power arm. And indeed the raising of the wing\r\n  follows in the manner indicated, since a muscle (_hi_) is attached\r\n  to the end of the wing-handle (_a_) which projects freely into the\r\n  breast cavity by the contraction of which the power arm is drawn\r\n  down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 172.—Scheme of the flying apparatus of an insect: _mnl_,\r\n    thoracic walls; _ab_, wings; _c_, pivot; _d_, point of insertion\r\n    of the depressor muscle of the wing (_kd_);—_a_, that of the\r\n    elevator of the wing (_ai_); _rs_, muscle for expanding,—_ml_, for\r\n    contracting, the walls of the thorax.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 173.—Muscles of the fore wing of a dragon-fly (_an_, _ax_),\r\n    exposed by removing the thoracic walls: _h_{1}_, _h_{2}_,\r\n    elevators,—_s_{1}_-_s_{5}_, depressors, of the wings (_s_{1}_,\r\n    _s_{2}_, rotators).—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, we have been entirely mistaken in reference to\r\n  the mechanism which lowers the wings. The muscle concerned, that is\r\n  _kd_, is not at all the antagonist of the elevator muscle of the\r\n  wing, since it is placed close by this latter, but nearer to the\r\n  thoracic wall. But then, how does it come to be the counterpart of\r\n  its neighbor? In fact, the lever of the wing is situated in the\r\n  projecting piece alone. The extensor muscle of the wing does not\r\n  pull on the power arm, but on the resistant arm on the other side of\r\n  the fulcrum (_c_). The illustration shows, however, how such a case\r\n  is possible. The membrane of the joint fastening the wing-stalk to\r\n  the thorax is turned up outwards below the stalk like a pouch. The\r\n  tendon of the flexor of the wing passes through this pouch to its\r\n  point of attachment (_c_) lying on the other side of the fulcrum\r\n  (_d_). Thus it is very simply explained how two muscles which act in\r\n  the same direction can nevertheless have an entirely contrary\r\n  working power.\r\n\r\n  This is in a way the bare physical scheme of the flying machine by\r\n  the help of which we shall more easily become acquainted with its\r\n  further details.\r\n\r\n  Dragon-flies are unquestionably the most suitable objects for the\r\n  study of the muscles pulling directly on the wing itself. If the\r\n  lateral thoracic wall (Fig. 173) be removed or the thorax opened\r\n  lengthwise there appears a whole storehouse of muscular cords which\r\n  are spread out in an oblique direction between the base of the wing\r\n  and the side of the thoracic plate. There is first to be\r\n  ascertained, by the experiment of pulling the individual muscles in\r\n  the line with a pincers, which ones serve for the lifting and which\r\n  for the lowering of the wings. In dragon-flies the muscles are\r\n  arranged in two rows and in such a way that the flexors or\r\n  depressors (_s_, 1 bis) cling directly to the thoracic wall (compare\r\n  also the muscle _dk_ in Fig. 172 and _se_ in Fig. 174), while the\r\n  raiser or extensor (_h_ 1, to _h_ 2, Fig. 172, _hi_ and Fig. 174\r\n  _he_) lie farther in. The form of the wing-muscles is sometimes\r\n  cylindrical, sometimes like a prism, or even ribbon-like. However,\r\n  the contracted bundles of fibres do not come directly upon the\r\n  joint-process we have described, but pass over often indeed at a\r\n  very considerable distance from them, into peculiar chitinous\r\n  tendons. These have the form of a cap-like plate, often serrate on\r\n  the edge, which is prolonged into a thread, which should be\r\n  considered as the direct continuation of the base of the wings. The\r\n  wings, therefore, sink down into the thoracic cavity as if they were\r\n  a row of cords ending in handles where the strain of the muscles is\r\n  applied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 174.—Transverse section through the thorax of a locust\r\n    (Stenobothrus): _b_{1}_, leg; _h_, heart; _ga_, ventral cord;\r\n    _se_, depressor,—_he_, elevator, of the wing (_fl_); _b-r_,\r\n    lateral muscles which expand the thoracic walls;—_lm_,\r\n    longitudinal muscles which contract them; _shm_, _uhm_, muscles to\r\n    the legs; _bg_, apodemes.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 175.—Inner view of a portion of the left side of body of\r\n    _Libellula depressa_, showing a part of the mechanism of flight,\r\n    viz., some of the chitinous ridges at base of the upper wing, and\r\n    some of the insertions of the tendons of muscles: _A_, line of\r\n    section through the base of the upper wing, the wing being\r\n    supposed to be directed backwards. _C_, upper portion of mechanism\r\n    of the lower wing; _b_, lever extending between the pieces\r\n    connected with the two wings.—After von Lendenfeld, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  As may be seen in Fig. 173, the contractile section of several of\r\n  the muscles of the wing (_s_{5}_) is extraordinarily reduced, while\r\n  its thread-like tendon is proportionately longer. This gradation\r\n  being almost like that of the pipes of an organ in the length of the\r\n  wing-muscles, as may so easily be observed in the large\r\n  dragon-flies, plainly indicates that the strain of the individual\r\n  muscles is quite different in strength, since, as the phenomenon of\r\n  flight demands it, the different parts of the base of the wing\r\n  become respectively relaxed in very dissimilar measure.\r\n\r\n  We have thus far discussed only the elevator and depressor muscles.\r\n  Other groups (_s^1s^3_) are yet to be added, however, crossing under\r\n  the first at acute angles, which when pulling the wing sidewise,\r\n  bring about in union with the other muscles a screw-like turning of\r\n  the wings.\r\n\r\n  While in dragon-flies all the muscles which are principally\r\n  influential in moving the wing are directly attached to it, and thus\r\n  evidently assert their strength most advantageously, the case is\r\n  essentially different with all other insects. Here, as has already\r\n  been superficially mentioned above, the entire set of muscles\r\n  affecting the wing is analyzed into two parts of which the smaller\r\n  only is usually directly joined to the wings, while the movement is\r\n  indirectly influenced by the remainder (Graber).\r\n\r\n  In the dragon-fly the two wings are “brought into correlative action\r\n  by means of a lever of unusual length existing amongst the chitinous\r\n  pieces in the body wall at the base of the wings (Fig. 175, _b_).\r\n  The wing-muscles are large; according to von Lendenfeld there are\r\n  three elevator, five depressor, and one abductor muscles to each\r\n  wing. He describes the wing-movements as the results of the\r\n  correlative action of numerous muscles and ligaments, and of a great\r\n  number of chitinous pieces connected in a jointed manner” (Sharp).\r\n\r\n  If again we take the longitudinal section of the thoracic cavity of\r\n  gnats in Fig. 171, we shall perceive a compactly closed system of\r\n  muscular bars intersecting each other almost at right angles and\r\n  interlaced with a tangled mass of tracheæ, some of which muscles\r\n  extend (_lm_) longitudinally, that is from the front to the back,\r\n  while others (_b-r_) stretch out in a vertical direction, that is\r\n  between the plates of the abdomen and back.\r\n\r\n  In order that we may more easily comprehend this important muscular\r\n  apparatus we will illustrate the thoracic cavity of insects by an\r\n  elastic steel ring (Fig. 172), to which we may affix artificial\r\n  wings. If this ring be pressed together from above downward, along\r\n  the line _rs_, thus imitating the pulling of the vertical or lateral\r\n  thoracic muscles, then the wings on both sides spring up. This is to\r\n  be explained by the fact that through this manipulation a pressure\r\n  is exerted on the lifting power arm of the wings. If, on the other\r\n  hand, the ring be compressed on the sides (_ml_), which is the same\r\n  thing as if the longitudinal muscles contracted the thorax from\r\n  before backward, and thus arched it more, then the wings are\r\n  lowered.\r\n\r\n  Agrioninæ, according to Kolbe, can fly with the fore pair of wings\r\n  or with the hind pair almost as well as with both pairs together.\r\n  Also the wings of these insects can be cut off before the middle of\r\n  their length without injuring their power of flight. Butterflies,\r\n  Catocalæ, and Bombycidæ fly after the removal of the hind wings.\r\n  Also the balancers of the Diptera must be useful in flying, since\r\n  their removal lessens the power of flight.\r\n\r\n  Chabrier regarded the under sides of the shell-like extended\r\n  wing-covers of the beetles as wind-catchers, which, seized by wind\r\n  currents, carry the insect through the air. We may also consider the\r\n  wing-covers as regulators of the centre of gravity of flight.\r\n\r\n  The observations of insects made by Poujade (Ann. Soc. Ent., France,\r\n  1887, p. 197) during flight teaches us, says Kolbe, that in respect\r\n  to the movement during flight of both pairs of wings, they may be\r\n  divided into two categories:—\r\n\r\n  1. Into those where both pairs of wings (together), either united,\r\n  and also when separated from each other, perform flight. Such are\r\n  the Libellulidæ, Perlidæ, Sialidæ, Hemerobiidæ, Mymeleonidæ,\r\n  Acridiidæ, Locustidæ, Blattidæ, Termitidæ, etc.\r\n\r\n  2. Into those whose fore and hind wings act together like one wing,\r\n  since they are connected by hooks (hamuli), as in certain\r\n  Hymenoptera, or are attached in other ways. Here belong Hymenoptera,\r\n  Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Cicadidæ, Psocidæ, etc.\r\n\r\n  The musculature of the mesothorax and metathorax is similar in those\r\n  insects both of whose pairs of wings are like each other, and act\r\n  independently during flight, viz. in the Libellulidæ. On the other\r\n  hand, in the second category, where the fore and hind wings act as a\r\n  single pair and the fore wings are mostly larger than the hinder\r\n  (except in most of the Trichoptera), the musculature of the\r\n  mesothorax is more developed than that of the metathorax.\r\n\r\n  To neither category belong the beetles, whose wing-covers are\r\n  peculiar organs of flight, and not for direct use, and the Diptera,\r\n  which possess but a single pair of wings. In the beetles the hind\r\n  wings, in the Diptera the fore wings, serve especially as organs of\r\n  flight. It may be observed that the Diptera are the best fliers, and\r\n  that those insects which use both pairs of wings as a single pair\r\n  fly better than those insects whose two pairs of wings work\r\n  independently of each other. An exception are the swift-flying\r\n  Libellulidæ, whose specially formed muscles of flight explain their\r\n  unusual capabilities for flying (Kolbe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LITERATURE ON FLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Marey, E.

In the terminal segments beyond the genital\r\noutlet, however, there is a reduction in and loss of segments,\r\nespecially in the adults of the metabolous orders, notably the Panorpidæ\r\n(Fig. 177), Diptera, and aculeate Hymenoptera; in the Chrysididæ only\r\nthree or four being usually visible, the distal segments being reduced\r\nand telescoped inward.\r\n\r\nThe typical number of abdominal segments (uromeres), _i.e._ that\r\noccurring in each order of insects, is ten; and in certain families of\r\nOrthoptera, eleven. In the embryos, however, of the most generalized\r\nwinged orders, Orthoptera (Fig. 199), Dermaptera, and Odonata, eleven\r\ncan be seen, while Heymons has recently detected twelve in blattid and\r\nForficula embryos, and he claims that in the nymphs of certain Odonata\r\nthere are twelve segments, the twelfth being represented by the anal or\r\nlateral plates. It thus appears that even in the embryo condition of the\r\nmore generalized winged insects, the number of uromeres is slightly\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\n  We have designated the abdomen as the _urosome_; the abdominal\r\n  segments of insects and other Arthropods as _uromeres_, and the\r\n  sternal sclerites as _urosternites_, farther condensed into\r\n  _urites_.

Ent. U. S. Dep. Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe reduction takes place at the end of the abdomen, and is usually\r\ncorrelated with the presence or absence of the ovipositor. In the more\r\ngeneralized insects, as the cockroaches, the tenth segment is, in the\r\nfemale, completely aborted, the ventral plate being atrophied, while the\r\ndorsal plate is fused during embryonic life, as Cholodkowsky has shown,\r\nwith the ninth tergite, thus forming the suranal plate.\r\n\r\n  In the advanced nymph of Psylla the hinder segments of the abdomen\r\n  appear to be fused together, the traces of segmentation being\r\n  obliterated, though the segments are free in the first stage and in\r\n  the imago (Fig. 178). It thus recalls the abdomen of spiders, of\r\n  Limulus, and the pygidium of trilobites.\r\n\r\n=The median segment.=—There has been in the past much discussion as to\r\nthe nature of the first abdominal segment, which, in those Hymenoptera\r\nexclusive of the phytophagous families, forms a part of the thorax, so\r\nthat the latter in reality consists of four segments, what appearing to\r\nbe the first abdominal segment being in reality the second.\r\n\r\n  Latreille and also Audouin considered it as the basal segment of the\r\n  abdomen, the former calling it the “segment médiaire,” while Newman\r\n  termed it the “propodeum.” This view was afterward held by Newport,\r\n  Schiödte, Reinhard, and by the writer, as well as Osten-Sacken,\r\n  Brauer, and others. The first author to attempt to prove this by a\r\n  study of the transformations was Newport in 1839 (article\r\n  “Insecta”). He states that while the body of the larva is in general\r\n  composed of thirteen distinct segments, counting the head as the\r\n  first, “the second, third, fourth, and, as we shall hereafter see,\r\n  in part also the fifth, together form the thorax of the future\r\n  imago” (p. 870). Although at first inclined to Audouin’s opinion, he\r\n  does not appear to fully accept it, yet farther on (p. 921) he\r\n  concludes that in the Hymenoptera the “fifth” segment (first\r\n  abdominal) is not in reality a part of the true thorax, “but is\r\n  sometimes connected more or less with that region, or with the\r\n  abdomen, being intermediate between the two. Hence we have ventured\r\n  to designate it the _thoracico-abdominal_ segment.” Had he\r\n  considered the higher Hymenoptera alone, he would undoubtedly have\r\n  adopted Latreille’s view, but he saw that in the saw-flies and\r\n  Lepidoptera the first abdominal segment is not entirely united with\r\n  the thorax, being still connected with the abdomen as well as the\r\n  thorax. Reinhard in 1865 reaffirmed Latreille’s view. In 1866 we\r\n  stated from observations on the larvæ made three years earlier, that\r\n  during the semipupa stage of Bombus the entire first abdominal\r\n  segment is “transferred from the abdomen to the thorax with which it\r\n  is intimately united in the Hymenoptera,” and we added that we\r\n  deemed this to be “the most essential zoölogical character\r\n  separating the Hymenoptera from all other insects.” (See Fig. 93,\r\n  showing the gradual transfer and fusion of this segment with the\r\n  thorax.) In the saw-flies the fusion is incomplete, as also in the\r\n  Lepidoptera, while in the Diptera and all other orders the thorax\r\n  consists of but three segments. (See also pp. 90–92.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 179.—Abdomen of _Machilis maritima_, ♀, seen from beneath: the\r\n    left half of the 8th ventral plate removed; I-IX, abdominal\r\n    segments; _c_, cercopoda; _cb_, coxal glands; _hs_, coxal stylets;\r\n    _lr_, ovipositor.—After Oudemans, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The cercopoda.=—We have applied this name to the pair of anal cerci\r\nappended to the tenth abdominal segment, and which are generally\r\nregarded as true abdominal legs. As is now well known, the embryos of\r\ninsects of different orders have numerous temporary pairs of abdominal\r\nappendages which arise in the same manner, have the same embryonic\r\nstructure, and are placed in a position homologous with those of the\r\nthorax. In the embryo of Œcanthus rudimentary legs appear, as shown by\r\nAyers, on the first to tenth abdominal segment, the last or tenth pair\r\nbecoming the cercopoda; and similar rudimentary appendages have been\r\ndetected in the embryos of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera\r\n(Apidæ). Cholodkowsky has observed eleven pairs of abdominal appendages\r\nin Phyllodromia.\r\n\r\nThey are very long and multiarticulate in the Thysanura (Fig. 179). In\r\nthe Dermaptera they are not jointed and are forcep-like. It should also\r\nbe observed that in the larva or Sisyra (Fig. 181) there are seven pairs\r\nof 5–jointed abdominal appendages, though these may be secondary\r\nstructures or tracheal gills. In the Perlidæ and the Plectoptera\r\n(Ephemeridæ), they are very long, sometimes over twice as long as the\r\nbody, and composed of upward of 55 joints; they also occur in the\r\nPanorpidæ (Fig. 177). In the dragon-flies the cerci are large, but not\r\narticulated, and serve as claspers or are leaf-like[35] (Fig. 180). In a\r\nfew Coleoptera, as the palm-weevil (_Rhynchophorus phœnicis_), Cerambyx,\r\nDrilus, etc., the so-called ovipositor ends in a hairy, 1–jointed,\r\npalpiform cercus. Short 25–jointed cercopoda are present in Termitidæ,\r\nand 2–jointed ones in Embiidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 180.—End of abdomen of _Æschna heros_, ♀: _ur_, urosternite;\r\n    _or_, outer, _ir_, inner styles of the ovipositor; 11, 11th\r\n    abdominal segment; _c_, cercopod.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 181.—Larva of Sisyra, from beneath. _B_, an abdominal\r\n    appendage.—After Westwood, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 182.—Cercopoda (P) of Mantis.—After Lacaze-Duthiers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe anal cerci are present in the Orthoptera and, when multiarticulate,\r\nfunction as abdominal antennæ. They are longest in the Mantidæ (Fig.\r\n182); they also occur in the larva of the saw-fly, Lyda (Fig. 183). Dr.\r\nA. Dohrn has stated that the cerci of Gryllotalpa are true sensory\r\norgans, and we have called those of the cockroach abdominal antennæ,\r\nhaving detected about ninety sacs on the upper side of each joint of the\r\nstylets, which are supposed to be olfactory in nature, and which are\r\nlarger and more numerous than similar sacs or pits in the antennæ of the\r\nsame insect.[36] From his experiments upon decapitated cockroaches,\r\nGraber concluded that these cerci were organs of smell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 183.—Lyda larva: _a_, head; _b_, end of body seen from above;\r\n    _c_, from side, with cercopod.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Haase regarded these appendages, from their late development and\r\n  frequent reduction, as old inherited appendages which are\r\n  approaching atrophy through disuse.\r\n\r\n  Cholodkowsky states that Tridactylus, a form allied to Gryllotalpa,\r\n  bears on the tenth abdominal segment two pairs of cerci (ventral and\r\n  dorsal), and that the ventral pair may correspond to the atrophied\r\n  appendages of the tenth embryonic segment of Phyllodromia, with\r\n  which afterward the eleventh segment becomes fused.\r\n\r\n  The cercopods are not necessarily confined to the eleventh or to the\r\n  tenth segment, for when there are only nine segments, with the\r\n  vestige of a tenth, as in Xiphidium, they arise from the ninth\r\n  uromere, and in the more modern cockroaches, as Panesthia, in which\r\n  there are but seven entire segments, they are appended to the last\r\n  or eighth uromere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 184.—Anabrus, ♀, side-view, dissected; showing the relative size\r\n    of the ovipositor: _c_, the minute cercopod.—Kingsley _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs to the homology and continuity of these cercopods with the ventral\r\noutgrowths of the embryo, several embryologists, notably Wheeler, are\r\nemphatic in regarding them as such. It thus appears that either the\r\nembryonic appendages of the seventh or eighth, ninth or tenth uromere\r\nmay persist, and form the cercopoda of the adult.\r\n\r\n=The ovipositor.=—The end of the oviduct is guarded by three pairs of\r\nchitinous, unjointed styles closely fitted together, forming a strong,\r\npowerful apparatus for boring into the ground or into leaves, stems of\r\nplants, the bodies of insects, or even into solid wood, so that the eggs\r\nmay be deposited in a place of safety. In the ants, wasps, and bees the\r\novipositor also functions as a sting, which is further provided with a\r\npoison-sac.\r\n\r\nMorphologically, the ovipositor is composed of three pairs of unjointed\r\nstyles (_rhabdites_ of Lacaze-Duthiers, _gonapophyses_ of Huxley), which\r\nare closely appressed to or sheathed within each other, the eggs passing\r\nout from the end of the oviduct, which lies, as Dewitz states, between\r\nthe two styles of the lowest or innermost pair, and under the cross-bars\r\nor at the base of the stylets mentioned; the styles or blades spreading\r\napart to allow of the passage of the egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 185.—Saw of Hylotoma: _a_, lateral scale; _i_, saw; _f_, gorget;\r\n    7_t_, 7th tergite; 6_s_, 6th sternite; _ov_, oviduct; _in_,\r\n    intestine.—After Lacaze-Duthiers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor is best developed in the Thysanura (Fig. 179, Campodea\r\nexcepted), in Orthoptera (Fig. 184), in the Odonata, Hemiptera, certain\r\nPhysapoda, Rhaphiidæ, and in the phytophagous Hymenoptera, where it is\r\ncuriously modified to form a rather complicated saw for cutting slits in\r\nwood or leaves (Fig. 185). It is wanting or quite imperfect in\r\nColeoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\nMorphologically, the ovipositor appears to be formed out of the\r\nabdominal appendages of the seventh, eighth, and ninth segments of the\r\nfemale, which, instead of disappearing in the orders first mentioned,\r\npersist as permanent styles.\r\n\r\nWheeler asserts from his study of the embryonic development of Xiphidium\r\n“there can be no doubt concerning the direct continuity of the embryonic\r\nappendages with the gonapophyses.” He goes on to say:—\r\n\r\n  “One embryo, which had just completed katatrepis, still showed\r\n  traces of all the abdominal appendages. The pairs on the eighth,\r\n  ninth, and tenth segments were somewhat enlarged. In immediately\r\n  succeeding stages the appendages of the second to sixth segments\r\n  disappear; the pair on the seventh disappear somewhat later. Up to\r\n  the time of hatching the gonapophyses could be continuously traced,\r\n  since in Xiphidium there is no flexure of the abdomen, as in other\r\n  forms, to obscure the ventral view of the terminal segments. From\r\n  the time of hatching Dewitz has traced the development of the\r\n  ovipositor in another locustid (_Locusta viridissima_), so that now\r\n  we have the complete history of the organ.”\r\n\r\nHeymons, however, is inclined to believe that they are simply hypodermal\r\noutgrowths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 186.—Ideal plan of the structure of the ovipositor to illustrate\r\n    Lacaze-Duthiers’ view: _b_, 8th tergite; _c_, epimerum; _a′_, _a_,\r\n    two pieces forming the outer pair of rhabdites; _i_, the 2d pair, or\r\n    stylets; and _f_, the inner pair, or sting; _d_, support of sting;\r\n    _e_, piece supporting the stylet; _R_, anus; _o_, outlet of oviduct.\r\n    The 7th, 8th, and 9th sternites are aborted.—After Lacaze-Duthiers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first to study the morphology of the ovipositor was Lacaze-Duthiers,\r\nwho referred their origin to the partially atrophied dorsal or ventral\r\nsclerites of one of the last abdominal segments; a view accepted by\r\nGerstaecker[37] (Figs. 186, 187). The present writer (1866), however,\r\nshowed that the sting of Bombus was not formed of the reduced pieces of\r\nthe segments themselves, but arose from special outgrowths on the\r\nventral side of the eighth and ninth abdominal segments. These\r\nappendages he did not at first regard as the homologues of the limbs,\r\nuntil in 1871, after studying the origin of the spring of the Podurans\r\n(Isotoma), he found that it was a true jointed appendage and therefore a\r\nhomologue of a pair of the styles forming the ovipositor of the winged\r\ninsects, and that the three pairs of styles of the latter were\r\nhomologues of the thoracic legs and cephalic appendages. The view was\r\nstated in the Guide to the Study of Insects. (See also Amer. Nat.,\r\nMarch, 1871, p. 6.) Kraepelin also affirms that the styles of the\r\novipositor are segmental appendages and homologues of the antennæ, wings\r\n(_sic_), and legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187.—1, abdomen of Cynips, showing the great dorsal segment, the\r\n    peduncle, and the position of the ovipositor within; 2, the entire\r\n    ovipositor; _a_, lateral scale; _a′_, its valve; _b_, anal scale;\r\n    _b′_, stylet; _c_, support of the stylet; _e_, base or support of\r\n    sting (_fi_); 3, profile showing the relation of the genital\r\n    armature to the rest of the abdomen, the 6th sternite having been\r\n    drawn to show its full size; 4, anal scale (_b_) and stylet; _e_,\r\n    _i_, supports and body of the stylet; _c_, piece uniting the two\r\n    scales; 5, lateral scale (_a_), and _a_′ sheath; _d_, support of the\r\n    sting (_f_); 6, transverse section of the body through the sting\r\n    (diagrammatic); _R_, internal armature; _o_, oviduct; _a_, lateral\r\n    scale; _a′_ its valve; _e_, support of the stylets (_i_); _b_, anal\r\n    scale; _c_, piece uniting two scales; _f_, sting; _d_, its support;\r\n    7, a second section simpler and more theoretical than the first; 8,\r\n    diagrammatic, all the elements of the sting have been reduced to\r\n    pieces of the same form.—After Lacaze-Duthiers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn objection to this view is the fact that the posterior pairs of styles\r\nappear to arise both from one and the same segment,—the ninth. Dewitz\r\nquestions whether the four appendages of the ninth segment represent two\r\npairs of limbs, or one pair split into two branches, and prefers the\r\nlatter view, but leaves it as a point to be settled by future\r\ninvestigations. As will be seen below, both Kraepelin and Bugnion\r\nobserved a pair of rudiments to each of the three penultimate segments,\r\nthose of the middle pair splitting in two. Wheeler maintains,\r\nerroneously we think, that the inner of the two pairs on the ninth\r\nsegment represents the tenth pair of abdominal appendages; but in\r\nreality this latter pair become the cercopods. That there are probably\r\noriginally in insects of all the orders provided with an ovipositor\r\nthree distinct pairs of appendages, one to each segment, is proved, or\r\nat least strongly suggested, by Ganin’s researches on the three pairs of\r\nabdominal imaginal discs of the third larva of Platygaster and Polynema\r\n(Fig. 188), which are transformed into the ovipositor. He remarks that\r\nthese imaginal discs have the same origin and pass through the same\r\nchanges as those in front, _i.e._ those destined to form the thoracic\r\nlegs. Dewitz has shown that the germs of the ovipositor of the honey-bee\r\narise as buds on the two segments before the last (Fig. 189).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 188.—Third larva of Polynema: _at_, antenna; _fl_, imaginal buds\r\n    of the wing; _l_, of the legs; _tg_, buds of the middle pair of\r\n    stylets of the ovipositor; _fk_, fat-body; _eg_, ear-like\r\n    process.—After Ganin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 189.—Imaginal buds and papillæ of the ovipositor of the honey-bee\r\n    attached to tracheæ; at different stages: _b′_, 1st; _b″_, 2d or\r\n    middle; and _c′_, 3d pair of papillæ.—After Dewitz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nKraepelin also detected in the larva of the honey-bee a pair of what he\r\nregarded as genuine imaginal buds on abdominal segments eight, nine, and\r\nten; the buds on the tenth segment are divided each in two; of these\r\nfour appendages the two median ones form the barbed sting (_gorgeret_ or\r\n_stachelrinne_), and the two lateral stylets, the valves\r\n(_stachelscheiden_). The two buds of the ninth segment give rise to the\r\nvagina and to the oviducts, and these unite secondarily with the\r\nposterior end of the ovaries. The genital appendages of the male\r\ncorrespond to those of the female, and arise from four imaginal buds\r\nsituated on the under side of the tenth abdominal segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 190.—1, sting and poison sac of the honey-bee: _GD_, poison\r\n    gland; _Gb_, poison reservoir; _D_, accessory gland; _sh_, sheathing\r\n    style or sting-“feeler”; _Str_ sting; _Ba_, sheath; _Q_, quadrate\r\n    plate; _O_, oblong piece; _W_, angular piece; _B_, base of the sting\r\n    and stylets; _Stb′_, _Stb″_, the two barbed stylets or darts. 2,\r\n    sting seen from the ventral face: lettering as in the other\r\n    figure.—After Kraepelin, from Perrier.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the ants, according to Dewitz, the genital armature is derived from\r\nimaginal buds situated on the under side of the seventh, eighth, and\r\nninth abdominal segments. Bugnion has observed the formation of six\r\nimaginal buds of the genital armature in the larva of a chalcid\r\n(Encyrtus, Figs. 41, 42, 191, _q^1_, _q^2_, _q^3_), the transformation\r\nof the central part of these structures into small digitiform pads, then\r\nthe division of the two intermediate buds into four (?) (Fig. 191, _B_,\r\n_q^2_), but was unable to trace their farther development.\r\n\r\n  The subject still needs farther investigation, since certain\r\n  observers, as Haase, and, more recently, Heymons, do not believe\r\n  that they are homologues of the legs, but integumental structures,\r\n  though of somewhat higher value than the style of the base of the\r\n  legs of Scolopendrella and Thysanura; but it is to be observed that\r\n  as yet we know but little of the embryological history of these\r\n  styles.\r\n\r\n  Those authors who have examined the elements of the ovipositor, and\r\n  regard them as homologues (_homodynamous_) of the limbs, are\r\n  Weismann (1866), Ganin (1869), Packard (1871), Ouljanin (1872),\r\n  Kraepelin, Kowalevsky (1873), Dewitz (1875), Huxley (1877),\r\n  Cholodkowsky, Bugnion (1891), and Wheeler (1892).\r\n\r\nAs shown, then, by our observations and those of Dewitz (Figs. 189 and\r\n192), the rudiments of the ovipositor consist of three pairs of\r\ntubercles, arising, as Kraepelin and also Bugnion (Fig. 191) have shown,\r\nfrom three pairs of imaginal discs, situated respectively on the\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth uromeres, or at least on the three\r\npenultimate segments of the abdomen. With the growth of the semipupa,\r\nthe end of the abdomen decreases in size, and is gradually incurved\r\ntoward the base (Fig. 193), and the three pairs of appendages approach\r\neach other so closely that the two outer ones completely ensheath the\r\ninner pair, until a complete extensible tube is formed, which, by the\r\nchanges in form of the muscles within, is gradually withdrawn entirely\r\nwithin the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 191.—_A_, end of larva of Encyrtus of 2d stage, showing the three\r\n    pairs of imaginal buds of the ovipositor _q^1_, _q^2_, _q^3_. _B_,\r\n    the same in an older larva ready to transform; _i_, intestine; _x_,\r\n    genital gland; _a_, anus.—After Bugnion.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  An excellent account of the honey-bee’s sting is given by Cheshire\r\n  (Figs. 194, 195). The outermost of the three pairs of stylets\r\n  forming the apparatus is the two thick, hairy “palpi” or feelers\r\n  (_P_), these being freer from the sting proper than in the\r\n  ovipositor of Orthoptera. The sting itself is composed of the two\r\n  inner pairs of stylets; one of these pairs is united to form the\r\n  sheath (_sh_), while the other pair form the two barbed darts. The\r\n  sheath has three uses: first, to open the wound; second, to act as\r\n  an intermediate conduit for the poison; and third, to hold in\r\n  accurate position the long barbed darts. The sheath does not enclose\r\n  the darts as a scabbard, but is cleft down the side presented in\r\n  Fig. 194, which is below when the sting points backward. But, says\r\n  Cheshire, as the darts move up and down, they would immediately slip\r\n  from their position, unless prevented by a mechanical device,\r\n  exhibited by _B_ and _C_, giving in cross-section sheath and darts\r\n  near the end, and at the middle of the former. “The darts (_d_) are\r\n  each grooved through their entire length, while upon the sheath\r\n  (_sh_) are fixed two guide rails, each like a prolonged dovetail,\r\n  which, fitted into the groove, permits of no other movement than\r\n  that directly up and down.” The darts are terminated by ten barbs of\r\n  ugly form (_D_, Fig. 194), and much larger than those of the sheath,\r\n  and as soon as the latter has established a hold, first one dart and\r\n  then the other is driven forward by successive blows. These in turn\r\n  are followed by the sheath, when the darts again more deeply plunge,\r\n  until the murderous little tool is buried to the hilt. But these\r\n  movements are the result of a muscular apparatus yet to be examined,\r\n  and which has been dissected away to bring the rigid pieces into\r\n  view. The dovetail guides of the sheath are continued far above its\r\n  bulbous portion, as we see by _E_, Fig. 195; and along with these\r\n  the darts are also prolonged upward, still held to the guides by the\r\n  grooved arrangement before explained; but both guides and darts, in\r\n  the upper part of their length, curve from each other somewhat like\r\n  the arms of a Y, to the points _c_, _c′_ (_A_, Fig. 194), where the\r\n  darts make attachment to two levers (_i_, _i′_). The levers (_k_,\r\n  _l_ and _k′_, _l′_) are provided with broad muscles, which terminate\r\n  by attachment to the lower segments of the abdomen. These, by\r\n  contraction, revolve the levers aforesaid round the points _f_,\r\n  _f′_, so that, without relative movement of rod and groove, the\r\n  points _c_, _c′_ approach each other. The arms of the Y straighten\r\n  and shorten, so that the sheath and darts are driven from their\r\n  hiding-place together and the thrust is made by which the sheath\r\n  produces its incision and fixture. The sides being symmetrical, we\r\n  may, for simplicity’s sake, concentrate our attention on one, say\r\n  the left in the figure. A muscular contraction of a broad strap\r\n  joining _k_ and _d_ (the dart protractor) now revolves _k_ on _l_,\r\n  so that _a_ is raised, by which clearly _c_ is made to approach _d_;\r\n  _i.e._ the dart is sent forward, so that the barbs extend beyond the\r\n  sheath and deepen the puncture. The other dart, and then the sheath,\r\n  follow, in a sequence already explained, and which _G_, Fig. 195, is\r\n  intended to make intelligible, _a_ representing the entrance of the\r\n  sheath, _b_ the advance of the barbs, and _c_ the sheath in its\r\n  second position. The barb retractor muscle is attached to the outer\r\n  side of _i_, and by it _a_ is depressed and the barbs lifted. These\r\n  movements, following one another with remarkable rapidity, are\r\n  entirely reflex, and may be continued long after the sting has been\r\n  torn, as is usual, from the insect. By taking a piece of\r\n  wash-leather, placing it over the end of the finger, and applying it\r\n  to a bee held by the wings, we may get the fullest opportunity of\r\n  observing the sting movements, which the microscope will show to be\r\n  kept up by continued impulses from the fifth abdominal ganglion and\r\n  its multitudinous nerves (_n_, Fig. 194, _A_), which penetrate every\r\n  part of the sting mechanism, and may be traced even into the darts.\r\n  These facts, together with the explanation at page 49, will show why\r\n  an abdomen separated many hours may be able to sting severely, as I\r\n  have more than once experienced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 192.—Base of the ovipositor of _Locusta viridissima_ seen from\r\n    beneath: _c′_, sheath, or outer and lower pair of stylets turned to\r\n    one side to show the others; _b′_, upper and inner pair; _b″_, third\r\n    or innermost, smallest pair of stylets. _A_, the same on one side,\r\n    in section.

Thus in Æschna (Fig. 196), Agrion (Fig.\r\n196, _C_), and also in Cicada it consists of a pair of closely appressed\r\nensiform processes which grow out from under the posterior edge of the\r\neighth uromere and are embraced between two pairs of thin lamelliform\r\npieces of similar form and structure.\r\n\r\n=The styles and genital claspers= (_Rhabdopoda_).—Other appendages of\r\nthe end of the abdomen of pterygote insects, and generally, if not\r\nalways, arising from the ninth segment, are the clasping organs, or\r\n_rhabdopoda_ as we may call them, of Ephemeridæ (Fig. 197), Neuroptera\r\n(Corydalus [Fig. 198], Myrmeleon, Rhaphidia), Trichoptera, Lepidoptera,\r\nDiptera, and certain phytophagous Hymenoptera. They do not appear to\r\noccur in insects which are provided with an ovipositor. In Thysanura the\r\nstyles are present on segments 1–9 (Fig. 179). Those of the male\r\nEphemeridæ, of which there are two pairs arising from the ninth segment,\r\nare remarkable, since they are jointed, and they serve to represent or\r\nmay be the homologues of two of the pairs of stylets composing the\r\novipositor of insects of other orders. The lower pair (Fig. 197, _rh_)\r\nare either 2–, 3–, or 4–jointed (in Oniscigaster 5–jointed), while those\r\nof the upper pair are 2–jointed (_rh′_). These rhabdopods in the\r\nephemerids are evidently very primitive structures, since they approach\r\nnearest in shape and in being jointed to the abdominal legs of\r\nScolopendrella and the Myriopoda. The styles of the Orthoptera are\r\nsurvivals of the embryonic appendages of the ninth segment (Wheeler,\r\netc.). In Mantis they are seen to have the same relations as the cerci,\r\nas shown by Heymons (Fig. 200).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 197.—Abdomen of _Ephemera_ (Leptophlebia) _cupida_, ♂: _c_, base\r\n    of cercopoda; _rh_, outer 3–jointed claspers or rhabdopods; _rh′_,\r\n    inner pair. _A_, side view.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 198.—End of abdomen of _Corydalus cornutus_, ♂: _vh_, rhabdopod;\r\n    _c_, cercopod.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Phasmidæ, in Anabrus, and in the Odonata the cercopods, which are\r\nnot jointed, are converted into claspers, and in the Odonata the\r\nclaspers are spiny within, so as to give a firmer hold. The suranal\r\nplate is apparently so modified as to aid in grasping the female. In\r\nnearly all the Trichoptera there are, besides the suranal plate, which\r\nis sometimes forked (Nosopus), a pair of superior and of inferior\r\nclaspers, and in certain genera (Ascalaphomerus, Macronema, Rhyacophila,\r\nHydropsyche, Amphipsyche, Smicridea, and Ganonema) the lower pair are\r\n2–jointed like those of Ephemeridæ. The number of abdominal segments in\r\nthe adult Trichoptera is nine, and McLachlan states that the genital\r\narmature consists of three pairs of appendages, _i.e._ a superior,\r\ninferior, and intermediate pair, besides the suranal plate (vestige of a\r\ntenth segment) and the penis. Judging by his figures, these three pairs\r\nof appendages arise from the last or ninth uromere, and the upper pair\r\nseem to be the homologue of the cercopoda of ephemerids. It needs still\r\nto be ascertained whether the intermediate pair is a separate set, or\r\nmerely subdivisions of the upper or lower, and whether one of the latter\r\nmay not arise from the penultimate segment, because we should not expect\r\nthat the last segment should bear more than one pair of appendages, as\r\nwe find to be the case in arthropods in general, and in the Neuroptera,\r\nfrom which the Trichoptera may have originated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 199.—End of abdomen of embryo of Mantis: _r_, rhabdopod; _c_,\r\n    cercopod; _sp_, suranal plate; _st_, stigma on 8th segment.—After\r\n    Heymons.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 200.—End of abdomen of _Periplaneta americana_, ♂, side view:\r\n    _c_, cercopod; _st_, stilus; _p_, penis; _t_, titillator; _d_,\r\n    “bird’s head” (clasper?); _i_, “oblong plate”; IX-XI, terminal\r\n    segments; X, suranal plate; XI′, 11th sternite.—After Peytoureau.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn most larvæ of the Trichoptera, especially the Rhyacophilidæ and\r\nHydropsychidæ, the last abdominal segment bears a pair of 2–jointed legs\r\n(cercopoda), ending in either one or two claws, which under various\r\nforms, sometimes forming long processes, persist in the pupa; and there\r\nappears to be a suranal plate, the vestige of the tenth uromere. In the\r\npupa, judging by Klapálek’s figure of Leptocerus (24_{8,9}, 25), a pair\r\nof lateral spines arise which may in the imago form one of the pairs of\r\nappendages or styles. In the pupa of _Œcetis furva_ his figure 28_{9}\r\nshows two pairs of 1–jointed appendages arising from the last segment;\r\nwhether the long dorsal or upper styles arise from the vestige of a more\r\ndistal segment is not distinctly shown in Klapálek’s sketch. The origin\r\nof these elements of the genital armature evidently needs further study.\r\n\r\nWhether the abdominal legs or so-called false or prop-legs of\r\nlepidopterous larvæ are genuine legs, homologous with those of the\r\nthorax and with the cephalic appendages, or whether they are secondary\r\nadaptive structures, is a matter still under discussion. That, however,\r\nthey are true legs is shown by the embryology of the Lepidoptera, where\r\nthere is a pair to each abdominal segment. It may also be asked whether\r\nthe anal legs of lepidopterous larvæ are not the homologues of the\r\n2–jointed anal appendages of caddis-worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 201.—_Eriocephala calthella_, ♂, side view: _t_, palpiform\r\n    suranal plate; _cl_, claspers; _s_, inferior claspers; _mxp_,\r\n    maxillary palpi; _cx_. coxa; _tr_, trochanter; _sc_, scutum; _sc′_,\r\n    scutellum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Lepidoptera, notably the male of the very generalized _Eriocephala\r\ncalthella_ (Fig. 201), besides the broad unjointed claspers, which are\r\ncurved upward and provided with a brush of stiff hooked setæ (this upper\r\npair being perhaps modified cercopods), there is an accessory lower\r\nslenderer pair, while the suranal plate (_t_) is palpiform or clavate\r\nand also adapted to aid in the action of the claspers. The examination\r\nof the cercopods and rhabdopods in the Trichoptera and in a generalized\r\nlepidopterous form like this enables one to understand the morphology of\r\nthe genital armature, since it consists, besides the suranal plate,\r\nwhich is often deeply forked (in Sphingidæ, Smith), of a pair of\r\nmodified hook-like cercopoda, and in some cases (Eriocephala) of an\r\nadditional pair of claspers which may be the homologues of the ephemerid\r\nrhabdopods. A pair of hooks, often strong and claw-like (_harpes_), are\r\nsituated, one near the base on the inside of each clasper; they are\r\nespecially developed in the Noctuidæ (Smith), and appear to be present\r\nin certain Trichoptera, but this remains to be proved. This complicated\r\napparatus of claspers and hooks is utilized by those insects which pair\r\nwhile on the wing, and is wanting in such forms as Coleoptera and\r\nHemiptera. Besides the forceps of Panorpa, there are two pairs of\r\nslender filiform appendages which need farther examination. In the\r\nDiptera, especially Tipulidæ, there is a pair of 2–jointed appendages or\r\nforceps, as in Limnophila (Osten Sacken). The male genital armature of\r\nDiptera appears to be on the same general plan as in Lepidoptera, but\r\nmore complicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 202.—Male organs of generation of Athalia.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNotice should also be taken of the paired uncinate hooks which are\r\nmodifications of the penis-sheath of the male of cockroaches\r\n(Phyllodromia), which Haase states appear to originate on the tenth\r\nventral plate, and which probably “serve to open and dilate the vagina\r\nof the female, especially as a perforated penis, which is highly\r\ndeveloped in Machilis, seems to be wanting in the Blattidæ.” (Haase.)\r\n\r\n=The penis.=—This is a single or double median style-like structure\r\neither hollow and perforated, or solid, very variable in shape,\r\nreceiving the end of the ejaculatory duct. It is usually enclosed\r\nbetween two lateral plates, the homologues perhaps of the inner pair of\r\nsheaths of the ovipositor. In the Coleoptera, as in Carabidæ and\r\nMelolonthidæ, the penis is a long chitinous tube, “retractile within the\r\nabdomen on the under surface as far as the anterior segments.”\r\n(Newport.) In the Hymenoptera, of which that of the saw-flies is a type,\r\nNewport states that it “consists of a short valvular projectile organ,\r\ncovered externally by two pointed horny plates (_i_) clothed with soft\r\nhairs.” Above these are two other irregular double-jointed plates (Fig.\r\n202, _l_) surrounded at their base by a chitinous ring (_k_); they are\r\nedged with prehensile hooked spines (_i_). Between these in the middle\r\nline are two elongated muscular parts (_m_) which enclose the penis\r\n(_h_), and which, like those in beetles, perhaps aid in dilating the\r\nvulva of the female.\r\n\r\nAn examination of Figs. 203–207 will aid in understanding the various\r\nmodifications in beetles, etc., of this organ.\r\n\r\nA general study of the anatomy and homologies of the male genital\r\narmature, from a developmental point of view, together with a comparison\r\nof them with the corresponding female organs, is still needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 203.—End of abdomen situated under the anal lobes of _Hydrophilus\r\n    piceus_, drawn out, seen from the ventral side: 6, sternal region of\r\n    6th segment; 7, 8, 9, segments telescoped, when retracted, in 6th\r\n    segment; _zw_, membrane connecting 6th and 7th segments; _G_,\r\n    intromittent apparatus; _vl_, external lobes; _vlu_, inner lobes;\r\n    _pn_, penis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 204.—The same as in Fig. 203, seen from the side: 6, the free 6th\r\n    segment; 7–10, the four last, when at rest, retracted and telescoped\r\n    within the 6th segment, with the copulatory apparatus (_g_); _vl_,\r\n    outer, _vlu_, inner lobe; 10_s_, tergite of 10th segment; 10_i_,\r\n    sternite of the same; _an_, anal opening.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 205.—Terminal parts of the male copulatory apparatus of\r\n    _Hydrophilus piceus_, torn apart: _vlu_, the two inner lodes; _pn_,\r\n    penis; _x_, membrane torn from under side of penis; _ej_,\r\n    ejaculatory duct; _os_, its opening on the under side of the penis,\r\n    directly under its tip. The muscles, tracheæ, and nerves are not\r\n    drawn.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Velum penis.=—In the locusts (Acrydiidæ) the penis is concealed by a\r\nconvex plate, flap, or hood, free anteriorly and attached posteriorly\r\nand on the sides to the ridge forming the upper edge of the tenth\r\nsternite. When about to unite sexually, the tip of the abdomen is\r\ndepressed, the hood is drawn backward, uncovering the chitinous penis.\r\n\r\n=The suranal plate.=—This is a triangular, often thick, solid plate or\r\narea, the remnant of the tergum of the last, usually tenth, segment of\r\nthe abdomen, the supra-anal or suranal plate, or anal operculum (_lamina\r\nsupra-analis_) of Haase. In most lepidopterous larvæ this plate is well\r\nmarked; in those of the Platypteridæ it is remarkably elongated, forming\r\nan approach to a flagellum-like terrifying appendage, and in that of\r\n_Aglia tau_ it forms a long, prominent, sharp spine. In the cockroach,\r\nboth Cholodkowsky and Haase maintain that the tenth abdominal segment is\r\nsuppressed in the female, the tergal portion being fused with the\r\nsuranal plate (the latter in this case, as we understand it, being the\r\nremnant of the eleventh segment of the embryo). As to the nature of the\r\nmiddle jointed caudal appendage in Thysanura and May-flies Heymons has\r\nsatisfactorily shown that it is a hypertrophied portion of the suranal\r\nplate, being in Lepisma but a filamental elongation of the small\r\neleventh abdominal tergite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 206.—Copulatory organ of a weevil, _Rhychophorus phœnicis_, seen\r\n    from above. _A_, _vl_, the lobes united into a capsule; _pp_, torn\r\n    membrane which connects the capsule with the 9th abdominal segment;\r\n    _ej_, ejaculatory duct. _B_, the same seen from the side; _mu_, end\r\n    of the muscle of the penis. _C_, the same as _B_, without the\r\n    capsule; _os_, opening of the ejaculatory duct (_ej_).

They are the _valvulæ_ of Burmeister, and podical\r\nplates of Huxley, who also regarded them as the tergites of an eleventh\r\nabdominal segment;[38] and the subanal laminæ of Heymons. They are\r\nwanting in Ephemeridæ.\r\n\r\n=The infra-anal lobe.=—Our attention was first called to this lobe or\r\nflap, while examining some geometrid larvæ. It is a thick, conical,\r\nfleshy lobe, often ending in a hard, chitinous point, and situated\r\ndirectly beneath the vent. Its use is evidently to aid in tossing the\r\npellets of excrement away so as to prevent their contact with the body.\r\nThe end may be sharp and hard or bear a bristle. Whether this lobe is\r\nthe modified ventral plate of the ninth urite, we will not undertake at\r\npresent to say.\r\n\r\n=The egg-guide.=—In the Acrydiidæ the external opening of the oviduct is\r\nbounded on the ventral side by a movable, triangular, acute flap, the\r\negg-guide (Fig. 88, _B_, _eg_). Whether this occurs in other orders\r\nneeds to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              LITERATURE ON THE ABDOMEN AND ITS APPENDAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n            _a._ General (including the cerci, stili, etc.)\r\n\r\n  =Cornelius, C.= Beiträge zur naheren Kenntnis von _Palingenia\r\n    longicauda_.

In\r\ncertain orders the skin is clothed with flattened setæ or scales, while\r\nmany forms, as some caterpillars (Figs. 208, 209), beetles (Fig. 210),\r\netc., are protected by spines, horns, etc., these in adult insects often\r\nforming secondary sexual characters, usually being more developed in the\r\nmales than in the females.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 209.—Larva of _Hyperchiria io_, on hatching.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The cuticula is not always smooth, but is often finely granulated or\r\n  even minutely spinulated. On the abdominal segments of Anabrus, as\r\n  observed by Minot, the cuticula is armed with microscopic conical\r\n  nodules scattered irregularly over it. They do not correspond, he\r\n  says, in any way to hairs; for they do not rest over pores, nor did\r\n  he see any specially modified cells underlying them. “As far as I\r\n  have observed, they are mere local irregularities, each nodule being\r\n  apparently supported by some four or six unmodified epidermal\r\n  cells.” Minot adds that the whole of the cuticula, except the cones\r\n  just described and the hairs, is divided into numerous minute\r\n  fields, each of which corresponds to a single cell of the underlying\r\n  hypodermis. Each field is bounded by a distinct polygonal outline,\r\n  and its surface is either covered by a large number of extremely\r\n  minute projecting points, as on the dorsal arch of the segment, or\r\n  is smooth, as upon the articular membrane and ventral arch. Upon the\r\n  sides of the dorsal arch and upon the spiracular membrane each field\r\n  has a projecting spine or sometimes two or even three. (See also pp.\r\n  28, 30.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 210.—_Phanæus pegasus_, ♂, from Mexico.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 211.—Section of integument of _Datana ministra_: _c_, cuticula;\r\n    _hyp_, hypodermis; _p_, outer pigmented nodulated layer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The cuticle of lepidopterous larvæ has also been described and\r\n  figured by Minot. In the caterpillars of different groups\r\n  investigated by him, the cuticle was found to be rough with\r\n  microscopic teeth or spinules, erect or flattened and scale-like,\r\n  and either densely crowded or scattered, and affording excellent\r\n  generic and specific characters. In the slug-worms (Limacodids) we\r\n  have observed that the cuticula is unusually rough, especially on\r\n  the spiniferous tubercle of Empretia, Parasa, etc. (Fig. 213, _c_).\r\n  The skin of the body between the tubercles is seen to be finely\r\n  shagreened, due to the presence of fine teeth, which are more or\r\n  less curved and bent, these teeth arising from a very finely\r\n  granulated surface (_d_). The cuticle of neuropterous,\r\n  trichopterous, and tenthredinid larvæ will probably afford similar\r\n  cases. The integument of the larva of Datana is, on the black bands,\r\n  rough and nodulated, the irregular nodules being filled with a black\r\n  pigment, and forming a layer (_p_) external to the true cuticula\r\n  (Fig. 211).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 212.—Hairs of Datana: _f_, formative hair-cell; _c_, cuticula;\r\n    _p_, pigmented layer; _hy_, hypodermis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe integument of many insects contains fine canals passing through the\r\nchitinous layers and opening externally in minute pores. Certain of the\r\npore-canals communicate with hollow setæ which sit directly over the\r\npores; other pores form the external openings of dermal glands, but in\r\nmany cases they are empty or only filled with air, and do not have any\r\nhairs connected with them. Each of these pores communicates with a\r\nhair-forming hypodermal cell, called by Graber a _trichogen_.\r\n\r\n=Setæ= (“hairs” and bristles).—The setæ of insects are, as in worms,\r\nprocesses of the cuticle originating from certain of the hypodermal\r\ncells. They arise either from a ring-like pit, or from a minute\r\ntubercle, and are usually situated at the outlet of a pore-canal, which\r\nconnects with an underlying cell of the hypodermis (Fig. 212). They are,\r\nthen, bristle or hair-like processes arising from the hypodermis. Where\r\nthe hairs or setæ are rubbed off, their site is indicated by a minute\r\nring like a follicle in the chitinous integument. The cuticular hair,\r\nsays Leydig, is in its first condition the secretion of the cellular\r\nelement of the skin, and a thread-like continuation of the cell-body may\r\nrise up through the pore-canal into the centre of the hair, remaining\r\nthere permanently.\r\n\r\nWhile the setæ are usually simple, they are often branched, plumose, or\r\nspinulose, as in larval Hemerobiidæ, Anthrenus, and Dermestes, the larvæ\r\nof certain coccinellid beetles, notably Epilachna, and of Cassida, the\r\nlarvæ of arctians, etc., and in bees (Anthophila, Megachile, Osmia,\r\nColletes, Apis, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe use of these spinulose, plumose, and twisted hairs in the bees is\r\nclearly shown by J. B. Smith, who states that as these insects walk over\r\nflowers, the pollen grains adhere to the vestiture, “and this also\r\naccounts for the fact, probably noticed by every observant fruit-grower,\r\nthat bees frequently bury themselves completely in the blossoms, or roll\r\nover every part of them. Such insects are after pollen, not honey, and\r\nby so rolling about, the pollen grains are brought into contact with and\r\nadhere to the surface of the insect.” The syrphid flies also pollenize\r\nflowers, the pollenizing of chrysanthemums being effected, as Smith\r\nstates, by _Eristalis tenax_, and he adds that the body vestiture of the\r\nsyrphids “is often composed of spurred and branched hairs.” (For\r\nreference to gathering hairs, see p. 45.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 213.—Cuticular spinules of larva of Adoneta: _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_,\r\n    different forms; _e_, _e′_, caltrops.\r\n]\r\n\r\nCertain remarkable spines occur in limacodid larvæ, notably Empretia and\r\nAdoneta. These we have called caltrops spines, from their resemblance to\r\nthe caltrops formerly used in repelling the attacks of cavalry. They are\r\nlargely concerned in producing the poisonous and irritating effects\r\nresulting from contact with the caterpillars of these moths, and are\r\nsituated in scattered groups near the end of the tubercles. A group of\r\nthree is represented at Fig. 213, _e_. They are not firmly embedded in\r\nthe cuticle, but on the contrary appear to become very easily loosened\r\nand detached, and they probably, when brought into contact with the skin\r\nof any aggressor, burrow underneath, and are probably in part the cause\r\nof the continual itching and annoyance occasioned by these creatures. It\r\nwill be seen by reference to Fig. 213, _e′_, that the body of the spine\r\nis spherical, with one large, elongated, conical spine arising from it,\r\nthe spherical base being beset with a number of minute, somewhat obtuse\r\nspinules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 214.—Glandular hairs of caterpillars. _A_, _Dasylophia anguina_:\r\n    _a_, of body; _b_, of head; _c_, of prothoracic shield. _B_,\r\n    _Ceratosia tricolor_: _a_, on body; _b_, on abdominal legs. _C_,\r\n    _Schizura ipomeæ_: _a_, from third thoracic segment; _b_, from larva\r\n    stage II; _c_, simple setæ from minute warts.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Glandular hairs and spines.=—In some insects occur fine, minute, hollow\r\nsetæ from which exude, perhaps through pore-canals of extreme fineness,\r\ndroplets of a clear watery or plasma-like sticky fluid. The club-shaped\r\ntenent hairs of the feet of Collembola, and the hairs fringing the feet\r\nof Diptera, are modified glandular hairs. Here they serve to give out a\r\nsticky fluid enabling the insect to walk on smooth surfaces; they end in\r\na vesicle-like bulbous expansion, which may contain numerous\r\npore-canals. Those of caterpillars were first noticed by Zeller, and\r\nDimmock has particularly described those of the larvæ of Pterophoridæ.\r\nThey are either club-shaped, or variously forked at the end (Fig. 214,\r\n_B_, _a_). They are usually replaced after the first larval moult by\r\nordinary, simple, solid, pointed setæ, and their use in caterpillars is\r\nas yet unknown. Whether these hairs, as seems most probable, arise from\r\na specialized glandular hypodermal cell, or not, has not yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 215.—_A_, group of setæ arising from a subdorsal tubercle: _cut_,\r\n    the cuticle; _hy_, the hypodermis; _sc_, the enlarged and\r\n    specialized cells of the hypodermis which secrete the spines\r\n    themselves; _pglc_, the nuclei which secrete the venomous fluid\r\n    which fills the cavity of the seta (_s_), seen at _p_ in a broken\r\n    spine. _B_, a short entire, and a long broken seta (_s-p_); _pgle_,\r\n    four poison cells; _p_, the poison in the hollow of the spine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese temporary fine glandular hairs are probably the homologues of the\r\nlarger true glandular bristles and spines of the later stages of certain\r\nlepidopterous larvæ, which are brightly colored and lead an exposed\r\nlife, living through a large part of the summer. In these structures the\r\nbristles or spines are hollow, filled with a poisonous secretion formed\r\nin a single large, or several smaller specialized hypodermal cells\r\nsituated under the base of the spine. In the venomous spines of _Lagoa\r\ncrispata_ the poisonous fluid in the larger spines (Figs. 215, _C_, 216,\r\n_b_) is secreted in several large cells situated at the base of the\r\nspine, and this is the usual form. In the finer spines of a large\r\ntubercle (Figs. 215, _A_, 216) there appears to be a differentiation of\r\nthe hypodermal cells into two kinds, the large, basal deep-seated,\r\nsetigenous cells (216, _sc_) and the poison-secreting nuclei (216,\r\n_pglc_) situated nearer the base of the setæ. The spines being filled\r\nwith poison and breaking into bits in the skin of the hands or neck,\r\ncause great irritation and smarting. These nettling or poisonous hairs\r\nor spines are especially venomous in the larva of Orgyia, _Empretia\r\nstimulea_, _Hyperchiria io_, the larvæ of the saturnians (Fig. 217) and\r\nlasiocampids, etc. They rarely occur in insects of other orders, though\r\nthe skin of Telephorus is said by Leydig to bear glandular hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 216.—Section of a subdorsal tubercle from a larva in stage 1:\r\n    _sc_, the setigenous cells, one for each seta; _pglc_, nuclei by\r\n    which the poison is secreted; _s_, seta; _p_, poison in middle of a\r\n    broken spine; _cut_, cuticle; _sd_, _tub_, spinulated surface of the\r\n    subdorsal tubercle.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Leydig states that in the stout bristles of Saturnia there is, as in\r\n  the integument of the body, a homogeneous cuticula, under which is\r\n  the cellular matrix (hypodermis), and the clear contents\r\n  (hyaloplasma) are secreted from the blood. The cell-structure of the\r\n  hairs consist, as in the cells of the body, of spongioplasma and\r\n  hyaloplasma. Leydig has observed the droplets of the secretion of\r\n  the caterpillar of _Saturnia carpini_ oozing through distinctly\r\n  observable pores, and states that there are similar openings in the\r\n  hairs and scales. Dewitz found easily observable openings at the end\r\n  of the hair of a large exotic weevil (Fig. 130).\r\n\r\n  The advanced nymph of Psylla is also armed with clavate glandular\r\n  hairs (Fig. 178).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 217.—Armature of last four segments of _Callosamia promethea_:\r\n    _a_, a dorsal seta; _b_, one showing the poison (_p_) within.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The tubercles are outgrowths of the body-walls; they are either\r\n  smooth, warty, or spiny, as in many caterpillars. While the armature\r\n  of insects is of little morphological importance, it is evidently of\r\n  great biological importance, the welfare or even the life of the\r\n  insect depending upon it; and it varies in each species of insect,\r\n  especially in Diptera, where the position of even a single seta\r\n  characterizes the species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 218.—Section through an antennal pectination of _Saturnia\r\n    carpini_: _a_, hypodermis, formative cells of the hairs (_c_); _d_,\r\n    cuticula; _e_, trachea.—After Semper.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 219.—Flattened hairs from the lateral tufts of larva of\r\n    _Gastropacha americana_: _A_, three from the lateral tuft of\r\n    _Heteropacha rileyana_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mode of development of the hairs was first described by Semper. In\r\nthe pectination of the antenna of _Saturnia carpini_ he observed that\r\nthe hairs arise, like the scales of the wings, from large round\r\nformative-cells lying in the cavity, which send out through the\r\nhypodermis and cuticle a long slender process which finally becomes the\r\nhair (Fig. 218).\r\n\r\nTactile hairs are those setæ arising over nerve cells or nerve\r\nterminations and will be discussed under the organs of sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 220.—The same in _G. quercifolia_: _a_, a small hair ending in\r\n    two minute processes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Scales.=—In very rare cases the hairs of caterpillars (Fig. 219) are\r\nflattened and scale-like, and this passage in the same insect of\r\ncylindrical hairs into flattened scale-like ones, shows that the scales\r\nare only modified hairs. Also, as we shall see farther on, Semper has\r\nproved that their mode of origin is identical. While true scales are\r\ncharacteristic of Synaptera (Thysanura and Colembola), as well as\r\nLepidoptera and Trichoptera, they also occur in the Psocidæ\r\n(Amphientomum), in many Coleoptera (Curculionidæ, Cleridæ, Ptinidæ,\r\nDermestidæ, Byrrhidæ, Scarabæidæ, Elateridæ, and Cerambycidæ), and in\r\nthe Culicidæ, and a few other Diptera, though they are especially\r\ncharacteristic of the Lepidoptera, not a species of this great order\r\nbeing known to be entirely destitute of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 221.—Flattened and spinulated hairs of tufts of larva of\r\n    _Acronycta hastulifera_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 222.—Scales from dorsal tuft, on second thoracic segment of larva\r\n    of _Gastropacha quercifolia_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe scales vary much in shape, but are more or less tile-like, attached\r\nto the surface of the body or wing by a short slender pedicel, and are\r\nmore loosely connected with the integument than the hairs, which are\r\nthicker at the base or insertion than beyond.\r\n\r\nThe markings of the scales, both of Synaptera and Lepidoptera, are very\r\nelaborate, consisting of raised lines, ridges, or striæ with transverse\r\nridges between. “The striæ of the transparent scales of Micropteryx are\r\nfrom about 500 to 300 to the millimetre, varying in different species.\r\nThe opaque scales of Morpho, which show metallic reflections, have about\r\n1400 striæ to the millimetre.” (Kellogg.)\r\n\r\nThe primary use of scales, as observed by Kellogg, is to protect the\r\nbody, as seen in Synaptera and Lepidoptera. A nearly as important use is\r\nthe production of colors and patterns of colors and markings, while in\r\ncertain butterflies certain scales function as the external openings of\r\ndermal scent-glands, and they afford in some cases (as first claimed by\r\nKettelhoit in 1860) generic and specific characters. Spuler has shown\r\nthat the scales are strengthened by internal chitinous pillars. Burgess\r\nhas observed in the scales of _Danais plexippus_ that the under surface\r\nof the scales is usually smooth, or provided with few and poorly\r\ndeveloped ridges, and this has been confirmed by Spuler and by Mayer\r\n(Fig. 226).\r\n\r\nIn the irised and metallic scales the ridges, says Spuler, are not\r\ndivided into teeth, and they converge at the base to the pedicel and\r\nalso toward the end of the scale (Micropteryx), or end in a single\r\nprocess beyond the middle (the brass-colored scales of _Plusia\r\nchrysitis_).\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the scales on the wings is, in the generalized moths,\r\nirregular; in the more specialized forms they are arranged in bands\r\nforming groups, and in the most specialized Lepidoptera they are more\r\nthickly crowded, overlapping each other and inserted in regular rows\r\ncrossing the wings, these rows either uniting with each other or running\r\nparallel. (Spuler.) The scattered irregular arrangement seen in\r\nMicropteryx is also characteristic of the Trichoptera and of\r\nAmphientomum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 223.—Portion of a longitudinal section through one of the young\r\n    pupal wings of a summer pupa of _Vanessa antiopa_: _s_, young scale;\r\n    _leu. cy._, leucocyte; _mbr. pr._, ground membrane; _prc_,\r\n    hypodermis-cells.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 224.—Portion of a longitudinal section through one wall only of\r\n    the pupal wing of a specimen slightly older than that of Fig. 223;\r\n    _s_, older scale.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Development of the scales.=—The mode of origin of the scales was first\r\nworked out by Semper in 1886, who stated that in the wing of the pupal\r\nSphinx and Saturnia they are seen, in sections, to arise from large\r\nroundish cells just under the hypodermis and which have a projection\r\nwhich passes out between the hypodermis (his “epidermis”) cells,\r\nexpanding into a more or less spherical vesicle, the latter being the\r\nfirst indication of the future scale. He observed that the scales are\r\nnot all formed at once, but arise one after another, so that on one and\r\nthe same wing the scales are in different stages of development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 225.—Portion of a longitudinal section through a pupal wing about\r\n    eight days before emergence: _s_, formative scale-cell; upper _s_, a\r\n    scale.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMore recently Schaeffer has stated that the scales and also the hairs\r\nare evaginations of greatly enlarged hypodermis cells, and still more\r\ncomplete evidence has been afforded by A. G. Mayer (1896). In the wings\r\nof Lepidoptera, about three weeks before the imago emerges, certain of\r\nthe hypodermis cells, which occur at regular intervals, begin to\r\nincrease in size and to project slightly above the level of the\r\nhypodermis; these are Semper’s “formative cells,” and are destined to\r\nsecrete the scales. They increase in length, and appear as in Fig. 223.\r\nIn the next stage observed, the projections are much longer (Fig. 224).\r\nThe hypodermis is now thrown up into a regular series of ridges, which\r\nrun across the wing. Each ridge, says Mayer, corresponds in position\r\nwith a row of formative cells, and each furrow with the interval between\r\ntwo adjacent rows. The scales always project from the tops of these\r\nridges. The ground or basal membrane has not participated in this\r\nfolding, and the deep processes of the hypodermis (_prc_) that once\r\nextended to this membrane have largely disappeared. Figure 225\r\nrepresents a more advanced stage almost eight days before the emergence\r\nof the imago.\r\n\r\nThe scales are originally filled with protoplasm, which gradually\r\nwithdraws, leaving behind it little chitinous bars or pillars which\r\nserve to bind together the upper and lower surfaces of the scales, and\r\nfinally the scales become “merely little flattened hollow sacs\r\ncontaining only air.” As Mayer shows (Figs. 226, 227), from the study of\r\nscales examined four days before emergence of the butterfly (Danais),\r\n“the striations upon the upper surface of the scale are due to a series\r\nof parallel longitudinal ridges,” while the under side is usually\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThe mode of insertion is seen in Fig. 227. The narrow cylindrical\r\npedicel of the scale is merely, according to Semper, inserted into a\r\nminute close-fitting socket, which perforates the wing-membrane, and not\r\ninto a tube, as Landois supposed. Spuler describes a sort of double sac\r\nstructure or follicle (_Schuppenbalg)_ which receives the hollow pedicel\r\nof the scale. This was originally (1860) observed by F. J. Carl Mayer,\r\nbut more fully examined by Spuler (Fig. 228) though not detected by A.\r\nG. Mayer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 226.—Portion of a cross-section through the pupal wing of _Danais\r\n    plexippus_, about six days before emergence: _sg_, scale; _cta.al_,\r\n    wing-membrane; _cl.frm_, formative cell of the scale; _mbr.pr_,\r\n    ground-membrane; _fbr.h′drm_, hypodermal fibres of pupal wings. _A_,\r\n    portion of a longitudinal section through the pupal wing, eight or\r\n    nine days before emergence; _prc_, processes of young hypodermis\r\n    scales.—This and Figs. 223–225 after Mayer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Spinules, hair-scales, hair-fields, and androconia.=—Besides the\r\nscales, fine spinules occur on the thickened veins of the wings of the\r\nBlattidæ, where they resemble fir-cones; also in the Perlidæ, in the\r\nTrichoptera, and in the more generalized Lepidoptera (Micropterygidæ and\r\nHepialidæ), occur, as indicated by Spuler, delicate chitinous hollow\r\nspinules scarcely one-tenth as long as, and more numerous than, the\r\nscales, which sometimes form what he calls “Haftfelds,” or holding\r\nareas. These spinules have also been noticed by Kellogg, and by myself\r\nin Micropteryx; Kellogg, and also Spuler, have observed them in certain\r\nTrichoptera (Hydropsyche). These also occur on the veins, and detached\r\nones near large one-jointed hairs, or hair-scales, said by Kellogg to be\r\nstriated. Kellogg has detected these scale-hairs, as he calls them, in\r\nPanorpa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 227.—View looking down upon the upper (_i.e._ exposed) surface of\r\n    one of the large scales situated on the veins of _Danais plexippus_,\r\n    about four days before emergence: _clm_, chitinous pillars found in\r\n    scales. _A_, _a_ smaller scale, _a_, _a′_, sections of the scales.\r\n    _B_, leucocyte found in the larger scale.—After Mayer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 228.—Scale-follicles: _A_, of a scale of _Galleria mellonella_:\r\n    _r_, neck-ring. _B_, the same of _Polyommatus phlæas_. _C_, the same\r\n    of a hair on inner edge of hind wing of _Lycæna alexis_ ♀.—After\r\n    Spuler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 229.—_A_, portion of wing of a caddis-fly (Mystacides). _B_,\r\n    enlarged, showing the androconia and hair-scales. _C_, a separate\r\n    androconium.—After Kellogg.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe “hair-scales” of the phylogenetically older Trichoptera correspond\r\nto certain scales of Lepidoptera, especially the Psychidæ (Spuler),\r\nvariously called “plumules” (Deschamps), “battledore scales,” also\r\ncertain minute cylindrical hairs. To these scent-scales is applied the\r\nterm _androconia_. They are found, almost without exception, on the\r\nupper side of the fore wings, occurring in limited areas, such as the\r\ndiscal spots, or on folds of the wings. Fritz Müller has shown that they\r\nfunction as scent-scales, and are confined to the males. Kellogg has\r\ndetected androconia-like scales on the wings of a caddis-fly,\r\n_Mystacides punctata_ (Fig. 229).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280.—Cross-section of androconia surface on wing of _Thecla\r\n    calanus_; _a_, androconia; _gl_, gland of base; _s_, ordinary\r\n    scales; _w_, wing in section.—After Thomas.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThomas has proved by sections of the wing of Danais, etc., that the\r\nandroconia arise from glands situated in a fold of the wing (Fig. 230),\r\nand he states that the material elaborated by the local glands, and\r\ndistributed upon the surface of the wing by the androconia, is that\r\nwhich gives to many of the Lepidoptera their characteristic odor. On\r\ncomparing these “glands,” it is evident that they are groups of\r\nspecialized formative cells of Semper (trichogens), which secrete an\r\nodorous fluid, issuing perhaps from extremely fine pore-canals at the\r\nends of the androconia. They thus correspond to the glandular hairs,\r\npoison-hairs, and spines of caterpillars, the formative cells of which\r\ncontain either a clear lymph or poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n      _a._ Hairs, bristles, cleaning spines, calcaria, combs, etc.\r\n\r\n  =Leydig, Franz.= Zum feineren Bau der Arthropoden.

The subject has been but recently taken up and\r\nis in a somewhat crude condition, but the leading features have been\r\nroughly sketched out by the work of a few observers from a physical,\r\nchemical, and biological point of view.\r\n\r\nThe colors of insects, as of all other animals, are primarily due to the\r\naction of light and air; other factors are, as Hagen observes, heat and\r\ncold, moisture and dryness, as recently shown by the experiments on\r\nbutterflies by Dorfmeister, Weismann, W. H. Edwards, and later\r\nobservers. They have their seat in the integument. Hagen divides colors\r\ninto optical and natural.\r\n\r\n=Optical colors.=—“These,” says Hagen, “are produced by the interference\r\nof light, and are by no means rare among insects, but they are solely\r\noptical phenomena. Colors by the interference of light are produced in\r\ntwo different ways: either by thin superposed lamellæ, or by many very\r\nfine lines or small impressions in very close juxtaposition.\r\n\r\n“1. There must be present at least two superposed lamellæ to produce\r\ncolors by interference. The naked wings of Diptera, of dragon-flies, and\r\nof certain Neuroptera often show beautiful interference colors. The\r\nwings of Chrysopa and Agrion show interference colors only for a certain\r\ntime, viz., as long as the membranes of the wings are soft and not\r\nfirmly glued together. Afterwards such wings become simply hyaline.\r\n\r\n  “The scales of Entimus and other Curculionidæ are well known for\r\n  their brilliancy, and it is interesting to remark that when dry\r\n  scales are examined with the microscope, many are found partly\r\n  injured, which give in different places different colors, according\r\n  to the number of layers which remain. The elytra of some\r\n  Chrysomelina and other beetles with iridescent colors probably\r\n  belong to the same category.\r\n\r\n“2. When there are scales with many fine lines or small impressions\r\nclose to each other, we have the second mode of producing colors.\r\n\r\n“The fine longitudinal and transversal lines of lepidopterous scales\r\nseem to serve admirably well to produce the brilliant effect of\r\ncolor-changing butterflies. But there must be something more present, as\r\nmost of the scales of Lepidoptera are provided with similarly fine\r\nlines, and only comparatively few species change colors. I remark\r\npurposely that the lines in the color-changing scales are not in nearer\r\njuxtaposition.” (Hagen.)\r\n\r\n  “The colors of butterflies change mostly from purple to blue,\r\n  sometimes to yellow. The splendid violet color at the end of the\r\n  wings of _Callosune ione_ is brought out by a combination of the\r\n  natural with interference colors. Originally the scales are colored\r\n  lake-red; but a blue interference color is mixed with it; hence the\r\n  violet hue results. The blue tones, _i.e._ the splendid varying blue\r\n  of the Morpho butterflies, Schatz claims, owe their hue less to the\r\n  interference of light than to a clouded layer of scales situated\r\n  over the dark ground, through which the light becomes reflected on\r\n  the same. The scales of the Morphids are in reality brown, as we see\r\n  by transmitted light; moreover, only the upper side of the scales\r\n  sends off blue reflections—the under side is simply brown. But the\r\n  blue scales of Urvilliana are also shining blue beneath; by\r\n  transmitted light they appear as if clear yellow. The smaragd-green\r\n  scales of Priamus show by transmitted light a bright red-orange, and\r\n  the orange-yellow of Crœsus a deep grass-green.” (Schatz in Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  “Krukenberg presumes the golden-green color of _Carabus auratus_ to\r\n  be an interference color. It is not changed by the interference of\r\n  light, nor was he able to extract from the elytra any green pigment\r\n  with ether, benzol, carbon of sulphur, chloroform, or alcohol, even\r\n  after having previously submitted the elytra to the influence of\r\n  muriatic acid or ammonia. Chlorophyll is not present, whether free\r\n  or combined with an acid.” (Hagen.)\r\n\r\n  Leydig has shown that the interference colors of the hairs of\r\n  certain worms (Aphrodite and Eunice) may be produced by very small\r\n  impressions in juxtaposition, which bring about the same effect as\r\n  striæ. Such an arrangement occurs on the feathers of birds, _i.e._\r\n  on the necks of pigeons and elsewhere, and Hagen suggests that this\r\n  kind of interference colors occurs more frequently among insects\r\n  than is commonly known. At least the limbs of certain forms appear\r\n  yellow, but when held in a certain position change to brown or\r\n  blackish. “I know of no other explanation of this not uncommon fact\r\n  on the legs of Diptera, of Hymenoptera, and of Phryganidæ.”\r\n  Interference colors, he adds, may occur in the same place together\r\n  with natural colors. “The mirror spots of _Saturnia pernyi_ show\r\n  besides the interference colors a white substance in the cells of\r\n  the matrix, which Leydig believes to be guanin. But this fact is\r\n  denied by Krukenberg for the same species and also for _Attacus\r\n  mylitta_ and _Plusia chrysitis_.”\r\n\r\n=Natural colors.=—These are divided by Hagen into _dermal_ (cuticular)\r\nand _hypodermal_. The dermal colors are due to pigment deposited in the\r\nform of very small nuclei in the cuticula. Hagen considers them as\r\n“produced mostly by oxidation or carbonization, in consequence of a\r\nchemical process originating and accompanying the development and the\r\ntransformations of insects.”\r\n\r\n  “To a certain extent the dermal colors may have been derived from\r\n  hypodermal colors, as the cuticula is secreted by the hypodermis,\r\n  and the colors may have been changed by oxidation and air-tight\r\n  seclusion. The cuticula is in certain cases entirely colorless,—so\r\n  in the green caterpillar of _Sphinx ocellata_; but the intensely red\r\n  and black spots of the caterpillar of _Papilio machaon_ belong to\r\n  the cuticula, and only the main yellow color of the body to the\r\n  hypodermis.” (Leydig, Histiol., p. 114.)\r\n\r\n“The dermal colors are red, brown, black, and all intermediate shades,\r\nand all metallic colors, blue, green, bronze, copper, silver, and gold.\r\nThe dermal colors are easily to be recognized as such, because they are\r\npersistent, never becoming obliterated or changed after death.” (Hagen.)\r\n\r\n  Minot and Burgess refer to the cuticular colors of the cotton-worm\r\n  (Aletia), the dark brown color belonging to the cuticula or crust.\r\n  “Upon the outside of the crust is a very thin but distinct layer,\r\n  which in certain parts rises up into a great number of minute,\r\n  pointed spines that look like so many dots in a surface view. Each\r\n  spine is pigmented diffusely, and together they produce the brown\r\n  markings. The spines are clustered in little groups, one group over\r\n  each underlying hypodermal cell.” (U. S. Ent. Comm., 4th Report, p.\r\n  46.) Minot also shows that in caterpillars generally a part of the\r\n  coloration is caused by pigmentation of the cuticula.\r\n\r\n  In a dull-colored insect, such as the Mormon cricket (Anabrus), the\r\n  coloration, as Minot states, depends principally upon the pigment of\r\n  the hypodermis shining through the cuticula. “Most of the cells\r\n  contain dull, reddish-brown granules, but scattered in among them\r\n  are patches of cells bright green in color. I have observed no cells\r\n  intermediate in color; on the contrary, the passage is abrupt, a\r\n  brown or red cell lying next a green one. Indeed, I have never seen\r\n  any microscopic object more bizarre than a piece of the epidermis of\r\n  Anabrus spread out and viewed from the surface.” (2d Report U. S.\r\n  Ent. Comm., p. 189.)\r\n\r\nThe pigment may extend through the entire cuticula, but it is usually\r\nconfined to the outermost layers, and occurs there in union with a\r\npeculiar modelling of the upper surface into microscopic figures which\r\nare of interest not only from their delicacy, but because they vary with\r\neach species. (See p. 184.)\r\n\r\nThe hypodermal colors, situated in the hypodermis, are, according to\r\nHagen, the result of a chemical process, generating color out of\r\nsubstances contained in the body. They are easily recognized, since they\r\nfade, change, and disappear after death. But where these colors are\r\npreserved after death and enclosed in air-tight sacs, as in the elytra\r\nand scales and hairs of the body, they persist, though, as we well know,\r\nthey may fade after exposure to light.\r\n\r\nThe hypodermal colors are mostly brighter and lighter than the dermal\r\nones, being light blue or green in different shades, yellow to orange,\r\nand the numerous shades of these colors combined with white;\r\nexceptionally they are metallic, as in Cassida, and are then obliterated\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\n  “The fact that such metallic colors can be retained in dead\r\n  specimens by putting a drop of glycerine under the elytra, leads us\r\n  to conclude that those colors are based upon fat substances. The\r\n  hypodermal colors are never glossy, as far as I know; the dermal\r\n  colors frequently.\r\n\r\n  “As the wings, elytra, and hairs all possess a cuticula, dermal\r\n  colors are frequently to be found, together with hypodermal ones,\r\n  chiefly in metallic colors. In the same place both colors may be\r\n  present, or one of them alone. So we find hypodermal colors in the\r\n  elytra of Lampyridæ. In the elytra of the Cicindelidæ the main\r\n  metallic color is dermal, the white lines or spots are hypodermal,\r\n  by which arrangement the variability in size and shape of those\r\n  spots is explained.\r\n\r\n  “There occur in a number of insects external colors, that is, colors\r\n  upon the cuticula, which I consider to be in fact displaced\r\n  hypodermal colors: the mealy pale blue or white upon the abdomen of\r\n  some Odonata, the white on many Hemiptera, the pale gray on the\r\n  elytra and on the thorax of the Goliath beetle, and the yellowish\r\n  powder on Lixus. Some of these colors dissolve easily by ether or\r\n  melt in heat, and some of them are a kind of wax. I believe that\r\n  those colors are produced in the hypodermis, and are exuded through\r\n  the pore-canals.” (Hagen.)\r\n\r\nThe white colors are simply for the most part due to the inclusion of\r\nair in scales. The white mother-of-pearl spots of Argynnis are produced\r\nby a system of fine transverse pore-canals filled with air; in\r\nHydrometra the white ventral marks have the same origin. (Leydig.)\r\n\r\nThe further statements and criticisms of Hagen regarding the relation of\r\ncolor to mimicry, sexual selection, and the origin of patterns are of\r\nmuch weight and will be referred to under those heads. Indeed, these\r\nsubjects cannot well be discussed without reference to the fundamental\r\nfacts stated in the masterly papers of Leydig and of Hagen, and much of\r\nthe theorizing of these latter days is ill-founded, because the colors\r\nof insects and animals are attributed to natural selection, when they\r\nseem really the result of the action of the primary factors of organic\r\nevolution, such as changes of light, heat, cold, and chemical processes\r\ndependent on the former.\r\n\r\nAs to the chemical nature of color, Hagen, after quoting the results of\r\nKrukenberg and others, thinks that the colors of insects are chemically\r\nproduced by a combination of fats or fat-acids with other acids or\r\nalkalis under the influence of air, light, and heat. He concludes:—\r\n\r\n1. That some colors of insects can be changed or obliterated by acids.\r\n\r\n2. That two natural colors, madder-lake and indigo, can be produced\r\nartificially by the influence of acid on fat-bodies.\r\n\r\n3. As protein bodies in insects are changed into fat-bodies, and may be\r\nchanged by acids contained in insects into fat-acids, the formation of\r\ncolors in the same manner seems probable.\r\n\r\n4. That colors can be changed by different temperatures.\r\n\r\n5. That the pattern is originated probably by a combination of oxygen\r\nwith the integument.\r\n\r\n6. That mimicry of the hypodermal colors may be effected by a kind of\r\nphotographic process.\r\n\r\n7. Finally, color and pattern are produced by physiological processes in\r\nthe interior of the bodies of insects.\r\n\r\n  Krukenberg concludes that change of color (in perfectly developed\r\n  insects) is a consequence of the change of food, and can be\r\n  explained by the alteration of the pigment through heat and light.\r\n  His experiments were made in order to ascertain the cause of the\r\n  turning of green grasshoppers in autumn into yellow and pink. He\r\n  tried to answer two questions: First, does the pigment of\r\n  grasshoppers originate directly out of the food, and does it consist\r\n  of pure chlorophyll or of a substance containing chlorophyll, or is\r\n  it to be accepted as a peculiar product of the organism? Second, is\r\n  the color the consequence of only one pigment, or of several?\r\n  Special analysis proves that the green color has no connection with\r\n  chlorophyll. He concludes: “It is evident that the green color of\r\n  the grasshopper is the consequence of several different pigments\r\n  which can be separated by a chemical process.” Krukenberg believes\r\n  that light has a marked influence on the color of insects and that\r\n  light turns to red or pink the insects which were green during the\r\n  summer. It would seem, however, more probable that cold was the\r\n  agent, the change being due to the colder autumn weather.\r\n\r\n  Here we might refer to the results of the studies of Buckton and\r\n  Sorby, on the changes in color of Aphides:—\r\n\r\n  “1. The purple coloring matter appears to be a quasi-living\r\n  principle, and not a product of a subsequent chemical oxidizing\r\n  process. Mounted in balsam or other preserving fluids, the darker\r\n  species stain the fluid a fine violet.\r\n\r\n  “2. As autumn approaches and cold weather reduces the activity of\r\n  the Aphides, the lively greens and yellows commonly become converted\r\n  into ferruginous red, and even dark brown, which last hue in reality\r\n  partakes more or less of intense violet or purple. These changes\r\n  have some analogy with the brilliant hues assumed by maple and other\r\n  leaves during the process of slow decay.\r\n\r\n  “3. Aqueous solutions of crushed dark brown and yellow-green\r\n  varieties of Aphides originate different colors with acids and\r\n  alkalies.\r\n\r\n  “4. In the generality of cases coloring-matters, such as indigo,\r\n  Indian yellow, madder-lake, and the like, do not separately exist in\r\n  the substance of vegetables, but the pigments are disengaged through\r\n  fermentation or oxygenation. Again, alizarin itself is reddish\r\n  yellow, but alkaline solutions strike it a rich violet just as we\r\n  find them to act towards the substance which Mr. Sorby calls\r\n  aphidilutein.\r\n\r\n  “5. Mr. Sorby’s four stages of the changes effected by the oxidation\r\n  of aphideine produce four different substances.”\r\n\r\n=Chemical and physical nature of the pigment.=—Researches in this\r\ndifficult field of inquiry have been made by Landois (1864), Sorby\r\n(1871), Meldola (1871), by Krukenberg (1884), and more recently by\r\nCoste, Urech, Hopkins, and Mayer, and the subject is of fundamental\r\nimportance in dealing with mimicry and protective coloration, the\r\nprimary causes of which appear to be due to the action of physical and\r\nchemical agents.\r\n\r\nOver twenty years ago Meldola observed that the yellow pigment of the\r\nsulphur-yellow butterfly (_Gonopteryx rhamni_) was soluble in water, and\r\nshowed that its aqueous solution had an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n  Besides the yellow uranidin found by Krukenberg in different beetles\r\n  and lepidopterous pupæ, still other coloring-matters, which are very\r\n  constant in different species are readily recognized by the\r\n  spectroscope. “Thus there appear in the brownish yellow lymph of\r\n  _Attacus pernyi_, _Callosamia promethea_ and _Telea polyphemus_,\r\n  after saponification of the precipitated soap readily effected by\r\n  ether, or incompletely or not removed by benzine, a chlorophane-like\r\n  lipochrome; and in the yellowish green lymph of _Saturnia pyri_ and\r\n  of _Platysamia cecropia_ besides this pigment still another whose\r\n  spectrum shows a broad band on D, but which disappears with the\r\n  addition of acetic acid or ammonia, as also after a long heating of\r\n  the lymph up to 66° C.”\r\n\r\nCoste, and more especially Urech, have shown that many of the pigments\r\nmay be dissolved out of the scales by means of chemical reagents, giving\r\ncolored solutions, and leaving the scales white or colorless. They have\r\nalso shown that some of these pigments may be changed in color by the\r\naction of reagents, and then restored to their original color by other\r\nreagents. They have proved that reds, yellows, browns, and blacks are\r\nalways due to pigments, and in a few cases greens, blues, violets,\r\npurples, and whites, and not, as is usually the case, to structural\r\nconditions, such as striæ on the scales (Mayer). They confined\r\nthemselves solely to the chemical side of the problem, not considering\r\nthe structure of the scales themselves.\r\n\r\nUrech has also discovered a beautiful smaragd-green coloring-matter in\r\nthe wings (not in the scales) of the pupa of _Pieris brassicæ_. It is\r\nnot chlorophyll, and Urech suggests that it may be either the germinal\r\nsubstance of the pigments of the scales or its bearer. It is not the\r\npigment of the blood.\r\n\r\nUrech has also demonstrated that in many Lepidoptera the color of the\r\nurine which is voided upon emergence from the chrysalis is similar to\r\nthe principal color of the scales.\r\n\r\n  Hopkins has worked on the pigments within the scales of butterflies.\r\n  The yellow pigment in _Gonopteryx rhamni_ is a derivation of uric\r\n  acid, and he calls it lepidotic acid. Its aqueous solution is\r\n  strongly acid to litmus, and must be bad-tasting to birds.\r\n\r\n  Hopkins has dissolved the red pigment from the border of the hind\r\n  wing of _Delias eucharis_, an Indian butterfly, in pure water,\r\n  finding as the result a yellow solution; but if the solution be\r\n  evaporated to dryness, the solid residue of pigment is red once\r\n  more. He has obtained from this pigment of _eucharis_ a silver\r\n  compound which contains a percentage of metals exactly equal to that\r\n  from the pigment of _G. rhamni_. (Nature, April 2, 1892.)\r\n\r\n  “The scales of the wings of the white butterflies (Pieridæ) are also\r\n  shown by Hopkins to contain uric acid, this substance practically\r\n  acting as a white pigment in these insects. A yellow pigment, widely\r\n  distributed in the same family, is shown to be a derivative of uric\r\n  acid, and its artificial production as a by-product of the\r\n  hydrolysis of uric acid is demonstrated. That this yellow pigment is\r\n  an ordinary excretory product of the butterfly is indicated by the\r\n  fact that an identical substance is voided from the rectum on\r\n  emergence from the pupa. These excretory pigments, which have\r\n  well-marked reactions, are apparently confined to the Pieridæ, and\r\n  are not found in other Rhopalocera. This fact shows that when a\r\n  Pierid mimics an insect belonging to another group, the pigments of\r\n  the mimicked and mimicking insects, respectively, are chemically\r\n  quite distinct. Other pigments existing, not in the scales, but\r\n  between the wing-membranes, are shown to be of use for ornament.”\r\n  (Proc. Royal Soc., London, 1894.)\r\n\r\n  Griffiths (1892) claims that the green pigment found in several\r\n  species of Papilio, Hesperia, and Limenitis, also in Noctuidæ,\r\n  Geometridæ, and Sphingidæ likewise consists of a derivative of uric\r\n  acid, which he calls lepidopteric acid. By prolonged boiling in HCl\r\n  it is converted into uric acid.\r\n\r\n  Spuler, however, finds that green does not depend on pigmentation,\r\n  but is an optical color. As remarked by Spuler, either the chitin of\r\n  the scales itself is colored reddish (yellow grayish), or the\r\n  pigment is secreted in the nuclei.\r\n\r\nA. G. Mayer believes that the pigments of the scales are derived from\r\nthe hæmolymph or blood of the pupa, for the following reasons: (1) He is\r\nunable to find anything but blood within the scales during the time when\r\nthe pigment is formed. (2) In Lepidoptera generally the first color to\r\nappear upon the pupal wings is a dull ochre-yellow, or drab, and this is\r\nalso the color assumed by the blood when it is removed from the pupa and\r\nexposed to the air. (3) He has succeeded by artificial means in\r\nmanufacturing several pigments from the blood which are similar in color\r\nto various markings upon the wing of the imago; chemical reagents have\r\nthe same effect upon these manufactured pigments that they do upon the\r\nsimilarly colored pigments of the wings. “It should be here noted,” he\r\nsays, “that in 1866 Landois pointed out the fact that the color of the\r\ndried blood of many caterpillars is similar to the ground color of the\r\nwings of the mature insect.”\r\n\r\n=Ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of colors.=—The colors of the\r\nwings of Lepidoptera, as is well known, are acquired at the end of the\r\npupal state. The order of development of the colors in the pupal wings\r\nhas been observed by Schaeffer, Van Bemmelen, Urech, Haase, Dixey,\r\nSpuler, and A. G. Mayer. The immature wings are at first transparent and\r\nfull of protoplasm. The transparent condition of the wings corresponds\r\nto the period before the scales are formed, and when they are full of\r\nprotoplasm; they then become whitish as the scales develop; the latter\r\nare at first filled with protoplasm, and afterwards turn whitish, being\r\nlittle hollow sacks filled with air. After the protoplasm has completely\r\nwithdrawn from the scales, the blood of the pupa enters them, and then\r\nthe coloring-matter forms. (Mayer.) He adds that “about twenty-four\r\nhours after the appearance of the dull yellow suffusion the mature\r\ncolors begin to show themselves. They arise, faint at first, in places\r\nnear the centre of the wings, and are distinguished by the fact that\r\nthey first appear upon areas between the nervures, never upon the\r\nnervures themselves. Indeed, the last place to acquire the mature\r\ncoloration are the outer and costal edges of the wings, and the\r\nnervures.”\r\n\r\nThe faint color of the scales gradually increases in intensity. “For\r\nexample, if a scale be destined to become black, it first becomes pale\r\ngrayish brown, and this color gradually deepens into black.”\r\n\r\nUrech states that in _Vanessa io_ first a white, and in _V. urticæ_ a\r\npale reddish hue, are spread over the entire wings, and then\r\nsuccessively arise other colors in the following order: yellow, yellow\r\nto brown, red, brown and black.\r\n\r\nSpuler, however, claims that the differentiation of colors and markings\r\ndo not follow one another, but arise simultaneously, and that his view\r\nis confirmed by Fischer. This may be the case with the highly\r\nspecialized and diversely marked butterflies, but certainly taking the\r\nLepidoptera as a whole the yellows and drabs must have been the\r\nprimitive hues, the other colors being gradually added in the later more\r\nspecialized forms.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that the most generalized moths, such as the species of\r\nMicropteryx, Tinea, Psychidæ, Hepialidæ (in general), etc., are dull\r\nbrown or yellow-drab without bars, stripes, or spots of bright hues.\r\nThese shades prevail in others of the more primitive Lepidoptera, such\r\nas many bombycine moths, and they even appear to a slight extent in\r\ncertain caddis-flies. The authors mentioned, especially Mayer, whom we\r\nquote, claim that “dull ochre-yellows and drabs are, phylogenetically\r\nspeaking, the oldest pigmental colors in the Lepidoptera; for these are\r\nthe colors that are assumed by the hæmolymph upon mere exposure to the\r\nair. The more brilliant pigmental colors, such as bright yellow, reds,\r\ngreens, etc., are derived by more complex chemical processes. We find\r\nthat dull ochre-yellow and drabs are at the present day the prevalent\r\ncolors among the less differentiated nocturnal moths. The diurnal forms\r\nof Lepidoptera have almost a monopoly of the brilliant colorations, but\r\neven in these diurnal forms one finds that dull yellow or drab colors\r\nare still quite common upon those parts of their wings that are hidden\r\nfrom view.”\r\n\r\nThe more primitive moths being more or less uniformly yellowish or drab,\r\nthe next step was the formation of bars, stripes, finally spots, and\r\neyed spots, these markings in the later forms appearing simultaneously\r\nin one and the same species of certain highly specialized moths and\r\nbutterflies. All that has been said will prepare the reader for the\r\nconsideration of the subject of insect coloration. The origin of such\r\nmarkings has been discussed by Weismann, Eimer, Haase, Dixey, Fischer,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Heer, O.= Einfluss des Alpenklimas auf die Farbe der Insecten.\r\n    (Froebel u.

INTERNAL ANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its general arrangement the muscular system of insects corresponds to\r\nthe segmented structure of the body. Of the muscles belonging to a\r\nsingle segment, some extend from the front edge of one segment to that\r\nof the next behind it, and others to the hinder edge; there are also\r\nsets of dorsal and ventral muscles passing in an oblique or vertical\r\ncourse (Figs. 16–18). As Lang observes, “the greater part of the muscles\r\nof the body can be traced back to a paired system of dorsal and ventral\r\nintersegmental longitudinal muscles.” The muscular system is simplest in\r\nlarval insects, such as caterpillars, where the musculature is serially\r\nrepeated in each segment.\r\n\r\nIn the larva of Cossus Lyonet found on one side of the body 217 dorsal,\r\n154 lateral, 369 ventral, and in the thoracic legs 63, or 803 muscles in\r\nall. “Adding to this number the 12 small muscles of the second segment,\r\nand 8 others of the third, which he did not describe, there would be for\r\nall the muscles on one side of the caterpillar 823. This would make for\r\nthe entire body 1646, without counting a small single muscle which\r\noccurs in the subdivision of the last segment,” and also those of the\r\ninternal organs as well as those of the head, so that the total number\r\nprobably amounts to about 2000, not 3000, as usually stated in the\r\nbooks. Lubbock admits that Lyonet was right in his mode of estimating\r\nthe number. In the larva of _Pygærci bucephala_ he found that “the large\r\nmuscles scarcely vary at all,” though certain smaller ones are very\r\nvariable. Lubbock observed that certain of the longitudinal muscles in\r\nthe caterpillar of Diloba split up into numerous, not less than ten,\r\nseparate fascicles. “This separation of the fibres composing a muscle\r\ninto separate fascicles is carried on to a much greater extent in the\r\nlarvæ of Coleoptera. Of course in the imago the number of thoracic\r\nmuscles is greatly increased, or at least in Dyticus and the\r\nwood-feeding Lamellicorns, which alone I have examined. In these two\r\ngroups each of the larger muscles is represented by at least twenty\r\nseparate fascicles, which makes it far more difficult to distinguish the\r\narrangement of the muscles.”\r\n\r\nThe muscles are whitish or colorless and transparent, those in the\r\nthorax being yellowish or pale brown; and of a soft, almost gelatinous\r\nconsistence. In form they are simply flat and thin, straight, band-like,\r\nor in rare cases pyramidal, barrel or feather shaped. They act variously\r\nas rotators, elevators, depressors, retractors, protractors, flexors,\r\nand extensors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 231.—Diagram of the muscles and nerves of the ventral surface of\r\n    the segments in the larva of _Sphinx ligustri_: _A_, _A_, recti\r\n    muscles; 1, 2, ventral recti muscles (1, recti majores; 2, recti\r\n    minores); 3, ridge giving origin to recti muscles of one segment,\r\n    and insertion to the same of the adjoining segment; 4, ridge for\r\n    attachment of muscle; 5, retractor ventriculi, connecting the\r\n    mid-intestine with the outer integument of the body. _B_, 6, first\r\n    oblique,—7, second oblique,—9, 10, third oblique, muscles; 11,\r\n    fourth oblique,—12. third rectus,—13, fifth oblique,—14,\r\n    triangularis, muscle; 15, transversus medius; 16, transverse ridge;\r\n    17, transversi abdominales; 18, abdominales anteriores; 19, 20,\r\n    abdominales laterales, some (20) longer than others; 21, obliquus\r\n    posterior; 22, postero-laterales obliqui; 23, transversus lateralis;\r\n    24, second transversus lateralis; 25, retractor spiraculi, or\r\n    constrictor of the spiracles, attached by a long tendon (26); 27,\r\n    retractor valvulæ.\r\n\r\n  Nerves: _a_, ganglion,—_c_, transverse nerves, of which _p_ is the\r\n    first, _q_ the second, _r_ the third,\r\n  and _s_ the fourth branch; _t_, the main trunk, which crosses the\r\n    great longitudinal trachea, receives a\r\n  filament from the transverse nerve (_n_), and divides into two\r\n    branches (_t_);—some of these branches\r\n  form a small plexus (_u_); the nerve _t_ divides in two divisions (_p_\r\n    and _v_).

To work it out thoroughly one should begin first with\r\n  that of Scolopendrella, then some generalized synapterous form, as\r\n  Japyx or Lepisma, then passing to that of a caterpillar, and ending\r\n  with some of the more highly specialized forms, such as a beetle,\r\n  etc. Thus far our knowledge is confined to that of the caterpillars\r\n  (Lyonet, Newport, and Lubbock) and the beetle (Straus-Durckheim) and\r\n  ants (Forel, Lubbock, and Janet).\r\n\r\n  =Musculature of a caterpillar.=—Newport’s account of that of the\r\n  larva of _Sphinx ligustri_ is the most useful (Fig. 231). The\r\n  muscles here present, he says, great uniformity of size and\r\n  distribution in every segment, the motions of each of these\r\n  divisions of the body being almost precisely similar, especially in\r\n  the 4th to 9th trunk segments. In these segments the first layer\r\n  seen on removing the fat and viscera are the flat straight recti\r\n  muscles. They are the most powerful of all the trunk muscles, and\r\n  are those which are most concerned in shortening the body, in\r\n  effecting the duplicature of the external teguments during the\r\n  changes of the insect, and which during the larval state mainly\r\n  assist in locomotion. There are four sets, two dorsal and two\r\n  ventral (Fig. 231, _A_, _A_). Without entering into farther details,\r\n  the reader is referred to the works of Newport and to Fig. 231.\r\n\r\n  =Musculature of a beetle.=—The best general account of the\r\n  musculature of a perfect insect is that of Straus-Durckheim in his\r\n  famous work on the Melolontha. We will copy the summary of Newport,\r\n  who adopted the nomenclature applied to these parts by Burmeister:—\r\n\r\n  “The muscles that connect the head with the thorax are contained\r\n  within the prothorax (Fig. 232, 2), and are of three kinds,\r\n  extensors, flexors, and retractors. The extensors, _levatores\r\n  capitis_ (_a_, _a_), consist of two pairs, one of which arises from\r\n  the middle line of the pronotum, and diverging laterally from its\r\n  fellow of the opposite side, passes directly forwards, and is\r\n  inserted by a narrow tendon into the anterior superior margin of the\r\n  occipital foramen. The other arises further back from the\r\n  prophragma. It is a long, narrow muscle that passes directly\r\n  forwards through the prothorax, and is inserted by a tendon near the\r\n  superior median line of the foramen; so that, while this muscle and\r\n  its fellow of the opposite side elevate the head almost in a\r\n  straight line, the one first described, when acting alone or singly,\r\n  draws the head a little on one side; but when the whole of these\r\n  muscles act in unison, they simply elevate the head upon the\r\n  prothorax. The depressors or flexors, _depressores capitis_ (_b_),\r\n  are exceedingly short muscles, which arise from the jugular plate,\r\n  or, when that part does not exist, from the border of the\r\n  prosternum, and are attached to the inferior margin of the occipital\r\n  foramen. They simply flex the head on the prothorax. The lateral\r\n  flexors, _depressores externi_ (_d_), are two little muscles that\r\n  arise from the same point as the preceding, and are attached to the\r\n  lateral inferior margin of the occipital foramen. The rotatory\r\n  muscles, _rotatores capitis_ (_c_), are two flat muscles like the\r\n  elevators, which arise, one at the side of the antefurca and the\r\n  other from the posterior jugular plate, and passing upwards and\r\n  outwards are attached to the lateral margin of the occipital\r\n  foramen. The _retractor_ or flexor of the jugular plate is a small\r\n  muscle (_e_) that arises from the margin of the antefurca, and\r\n  passing directly forwards is inserted by a small tendon into the\r\n  middle of the jugular piece. The _oblique extensor_ of the jugular\r\n  plate is a long, slender muscle (_f_) that arises from the external\r\n  margin of the pronotum, and passing obliquely downwards and forwards\r\n  traverses the prothorax and is inserted by a narrow tendon to the\r\n  jugular plate immediately before the retractor. The other retractor\r\n  (_g_) arises from the anterior superior boundary of the pronotum,\r\n  and passing downwards is inserted into the jugular plate between the\r\n  larger levator and _flexor capitis_.\r\n\r\n  “The muscles proper to the prothorax consist of four pairs, by which\r\n  it is united to the succeeding segments. The first of these, the\r\n  superior retractor, _retractor prothoracis superior_ (_h_), arises\r\n  by a broad, fleshy head from the anterior external margin of the\r\n  pronotum, and passing directly backwards is inserted by a tendon\r\n  into the prophragma, a little on one side of the median line. The\r\n  next muscle of importance, the inferior retractor (_i_), arises from\r\n  the anterior border of the medifurca, and is united to the posterior\r\n  of the antefurca, thus forming with that muscle part of the great\r\n  recti of the larva. This muscle must be considered as the proper\r\n  depressor of the prothorax. The _elevator prothoracis_ (_k_) is\r\n  narrow, pyramidal, and arises fleshy from the lateral surface of the\r\n  prophragma. It passes downwards and is attached by a narrow tendon\r\n  to the superior portion of the antefurca. The _rotatores\r\n  prothoracis_ are the largest of all the muscles of this segment.\r\n  They arise, one on each side (_l_), by a narrow head from the\r\n  posterior part of the pronotum, and passing beneath the prophragma\r\n  are considerably enlarged and attached to the tegument between the\r\n  two segments, and also to the anterior portion of the mesothorax.\r\n  The remaining muscle proper to the prothorax is the closer of the\r\n  spiracle, an exceedingly small muscle not shown in the drawing.\r\n\r\n  “The other muscles of this segment are those of the legs, which are\r\n  of considerable size. There are three distinct flexors of the coxa\r\n  (_m_, _n_, _o_). The first of these arises from the superior lateral\r\n  border of the pronotum, the second from the superior posterior\r\n  border, the third from the sides of the prothorax, and the fourth a\r\n  little nearer posteriorly, and the whole of them are attached by\r\n  narrow tendons to the sides of the coxa. But there is only one\r\n  extensor muscle to this part. In like manner, the extensor of the\r\n  trochanter is formed of three portions (Fig. 233, _a_, _b_, _c_);\r\n  but there is only one flexor (_d_), and one abductor (_e_). In the\r\n  femur, there is one extensor (_f_),—a long penniform muscle that\r\n  occupies the superior part of the thigh, and is attached by a tendon\r\n  to the anterior-posterior margin of the joint formed by the end of\r\n  the tibia. There is also but one flexor (_g_) in the femur, which,\r\n  like the preceding muscle, is penniform, and occupies the inferior\r\n  portion of the femur, and its tendon is attached to the inferior\r\n  border of the tibia. In the tibia itself there is also one flexor\r\n  and one extensor. The _flexor_ (_i_) occupies the superior portion\r\n  of the limb, and ends in a long tendon (_l_) that passes directly\r\n  through the joints of the tarsus, on their inferior surface, and is\r\n  attached to the inferior margin of the claw (_g_). The _extensor_\r\n  (_h_) occupies the inferior portion of the tibia, and is shorter\r\n  than the preceding muscle, like which it ends in a long tendon that\r\n  is attached to the upper margin of the claw. Besides these muscles,\r\n  which are common to the joints of the tarsus, there are two others\r\n  belonging to the claw, situated in the last joint. The first of\r\n  these, the _extensor_ (_m_), is short, and occupies the superior\r\n  portion of the last phalanx of the tarsus, and the other, the\r\n  _flexor_ (_n_), is a much longer penniform muscle, which occupies\r\n  nearly the whole of the upper and under surface of the posterior\r\n  part of the phalanx, and is attached, like the long flexor of the\r\n  tarsus, to the inferior part of the claw.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 233.—Muscles of the fore leg of _Melolontha vulgaris_: _a_,\r\n    _b_, _c_, three divisions of the extensor of the trochanter; _d_,\r\n    flexor,—_e_, abductor, of the trochanter; _f_, extensor of the\r\n    femur; _g_, flexor of the femur; _h_, extensor of the tibia; _i_,\r\n    flexor of the tibia; _l_, tendon attached to the lower edge of the\r\n    claw (_g_); _m_, extensor,—_n_, flexor, of the claw.—After\r\n    Straus-Durckheim, from Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  These are the muscles of the prothorax, and its organs of\r\n  locomotion. The reader is referred for a further account of the\r\n  muscles of the hinder thoracic and of the abdominal segments to\r\n  Straus-Durckheim’s original work.\r\n\r\n=Minute structure of the muscles.=—The muscular fibres of insects are\r\nstriated (Figs. 235–238), even those of the alimentary canal; the only\r\nnotable exception being the alary muscles of the pericardial septum,\r\nwhile Lowne states that certain of the thoracic muscles of the blow-fly\r\nare not striated (Miall and Denny).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 234.-Section through the prothorax of _Diapheromera femoratum_:\r\n    _prov_, proventriculus; _tr_, trachea; _n. c_, nervous cord; _s.\r\n    gl_, salivary gland; _hyp_, hypodermis; _ur. t_, urinary tube; _ht_,\r\n    heart; _m_, _m″_, _m‴_, muscles for lowering and raising the tergum;\r\n    _m′_, another muscle, its use unknown.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 235.—Striated muscular fibre of Hydrophilus: _A_ and _B_, two\r\n    fibrillæ in a state of extension; _a_, thick disk; _b_, thin disk;\r\n    _c_, intermediate space. _C_, _D_, portion of the same fibrillæ seen\r\n    by moving the objective farther away and using a small diaphragm;\r\n    _n_, thick; _c_, thin disk. × 2000 diam.—After Ranvier, from\r\n    Perrier. _E_ after Gehuchten, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn describing the minute structure of the muscles of ants, wasps, and\r\nbees, C. Janet states that each consists of a group of fibres diverging\r\nfrom a tendon, which is an integumentary invagination (Fig. 236). Each\r\nfibre may be regarded as a multinucleate cell; the sarcolemma represents\r\nthe cell-membrane. It forms a resistant and extremely elastic tube. The\r\nlongitudinal (Fig. 236, _E_) and radiating filaments or reticulum\r\n(spongioplasm of Gehuchten) lie in a nutritive filling substance (the\r\nhyaloplasm of Gehuchten). The radiating filaments are formed of an\r\nexceedingly elastic substance, and serve to sustain the longitudinal\r\nfilaments, to transmit the nervous stimulus to them, and to bring them\r\nback into position after contraction. Janet’s account agrees on the\r\nwhole with that of Gehuchten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 236.—Preparations from the adductor muscle of the mandible of\r\n    _Vespa crabro_, worker, fixed by heat and alcohol several hours\r\n    after leaving its cell. _A_ to _E_ × 425; _F_ × 212: _A_, terminal\r\n    cupule of the tendon of a fibre. _B_, _C_, union of the fibres with\r\n    their tendon. _D_, branch of the tendon of a muscle sending out\r\n    tendons of some of the fibres; this branch is accompanied with\r\n    numerous nervous ramifications (_N_). _E_, fragment of a nerve which\r\n    furnishes the ramifications of Fig. _D_. _F_, fragment of the tendon\r\n    of the adductor muscle of the mandible; at the left are seen the\r\n    terminal cupules of the fibres (_td, c_); on the right, on the body\r\n    of the tendons, some sessile cupules, each of which forms the\r\n    attachment of a fibre; _td, b_, tendons of the fibres.—After Janet.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe muscles of flight are said to be penetrated by fine tracheal\r\nbranches, probably to supply a greater amount of oxygen, as the most\r\nenergetic movements of the insect are made in moving the wings during\r\nflight; while the other muscles of the body are only surrounded by the\r\nair-tubes. (Sharp.)\r\n\r\nWithout entering into tedious details, the reader is referred to figures\r\nor references to the more important systems of muscles, such as those of\r\nthe legs and other appendages, of the wings, of respiration, etc., to\r\nthe sections treating of those organs or functions; also to Figs. 16,\r\n17, 18, 22, 48, 74, 81, 83, 84, 115, 116, 172, 173, 174, etc.\r\n\r\n=Muscular power of insects.=—The most detailed and careful experiments\r\nare those of Plateau. His experiments prove that even the weakest\r\ninsects pull at least five times their own weight; many of them,\r\nhowever, get the better of a burden twelve to twenty fold as heavy as\r\nthemselves, while a strong man or a draught horse, for example, is not\r\neven able to pull a burden which is equal to the weight of his body.\r\nPlateau came to the following results as to the relation of the weight\r\nof the body to the load drawn (1 and 2 are to be compared with each\r\nother, 1 being the larger, and 2 the smaller insect; it will be seen\r\nthat the smaller insect is the stronger).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 237.—_Vespa crabro_, worker, fixed by heat and alcohol some hours\r\n    after leaving its cell. _A_ × 425;

The first of these is\r\nthe brain or supraœsophageal ganglion; it is situated in the upper part\r\nof the head, above the gullet or œsophagus, while the rest of the\r\nsystem, called the ventral cord, lies on the floor of the body, under\r\nthe digestive canal.\r\n\r\nA ganglion or nerve-centre consists of a mass of ganglion-cells, from\r\neach of which a process or fibre passes off, uniting with others to form\r\na nerve; by means of these nerves the ganglia are connected with other\r\nganglia, and with the sensory cells and muscle-fibres. The ganglia may\r\nbe simple, and arranged in pairs, corresponding to each segment of the\r\nbody, or they may be compound, the result of the fusion of several pairs\r\nof ganglia, which in the early stages of the embryo are separate. Thus\r\nthe brain of insects is a compound ganglion, or ganglionic mass.\r\n\r\nThe nerves are of two kinds: 1. _Sensory_, which transmit sensations\r\nfrom the peripheral sense-cells to the ganglion, or brain; 2. _Motor_,\r\nwhich send stimuli from the brain or any other ganglion to the muscles.\r\n\r\nOf ganglion cells, some are tactile, and others give rise to nerves of\r\nspecial sense, being distributed to the eyes, or to the organs of\r\nhearing, smell, taste, or touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 240.—Nervous system of _Melanoplus spretus_: _sp_,\r\n    supraœsophageal ganglion, sending off the large optic nerve (_op_)\r\n    to the eyes, and an ocellar nerve to each ocellus (the dotted line\r\n    _oc_ stops short of the left ocellus); _if_, infraœsophageal\r\n    ganglion; 1, 2, 3, thoracic ganglia; 1–5, five abdominal ganglia\r\n    (the fifth the largest, and sending branches to the ovipositor,\r\n    etc.) The sympathetic nerve and ganglia are represented by the two\r\n    main nerves which arise from the medio-cephalic (_as_) resting on\r\n    and above the œsophagus, and two ganglia (_ps_) on the under side of\r\n    the crop. From each of these ganglia, two nerves are sent under the\r\n    crop, and a larger nerve on each side to as far as the stomachal\r\n    cæca, ending the figure at the dotted line 2, near the second\r\n    thoracic ganglion. _u_, a round, shining body, connected by a nerve\r\n    with the medio-cephalic ganglion, its nature unknown.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 241.—Section through the head of Machilis, showing the brain\r\n    (_br_), and subœsophageal ganglion (_soe. g_); _cl_, clypeus; _lbr_,\r\n    labrum; _oc_, ocellus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile the supraœsophageal ganglion, or “brain,” of the insect is much\r\nmore complex than any other ganglion, consisting more exclusively both\r\nof sensory as well as motor ganglia and their nerves, it should be borne\r\nin mind that the subœsophageal ganglion also receives nerves of special\r\nsense, situated on the palpi and on the tongue, as in the bee and other\r\ninsects; hence this ganglion is probably complex, consisting of sensory\r\nand motor cells. The third thoracic ganglion is also, without doubt, a\r\ncomplex one, as in the locusts the auditory nerves pass into it from the\r\nears, which are situated at the base of the abdomen, while in the green\r\ngrasshoppers, such as the katydids and their allies, whose ears are\r\nsituated in their fore legs, the first thoracic ganglion is a complex\r\none. In the cockroach and in Leptis (Chrysopila), a common fly, the\r\ncaudal appendages bear what are probably olfactory organs, and as these\r\nparts are undoubtedly supplied from the last abdominal ganglion, this is\r\nprobably composed of sensory and motor ganglia; so that we have in the\r\nganglionated cord of insects a series of brains, as it were, running\r\nfrom head to tail, and thus in a still stronger sense than in\r\nvertebrates the entire nervous system, and not the brain alone, is the\r\norgan of the mind of insects.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, most primitive form of the nervous system of insects is\r\nseen in that of the Thysanura. That of Campodea has not yet been fully\r\nexamined, but in that of the more complicated genus, Machilis (Fig.\r\n239), we see that there is a pair of ganglia to nearly each segment,\r\nwhile the brain (Fig. 241) is composed of three lobes, viz. the optic,\r\nthe cerebral (Fig. 239, _g_), behind which is the antennal lobe, from\r\nwhich the antennal nerve takes its origin. Behind the opening for the\r\nthroat (_oe_) is situated the first ganglion of the ventral cord, the\r\nsubœsophageal ganglion, which gives rise to the nerves supplying the\r\njaws and other mouth-parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 242, _A-D._—The nervous systems of 4 genera of Diptera, to\r\n    demonstrate their various degrees of fusion of ganglia: _A_,\r\n    non-concentrated more primitive nervous system of _Chironomus\r\n    plumosus_, with 3 thoracic and 6 abdominal ganglionic masses. _B_,\r\n    nervous system of _Empis stercorea_, with 2 thoracic and 5 abdominal\r\n    ganglionic masses. _C_, nervous system of _Tabanus bovinus_, with 1\r\n    thoracic ganglionic mass, and the abdominal ganglia closely\r\n    approximated. _D_, highly modified nervous system of _Sarcophaga\r\n    carnaria_, in which all the ganglia of the ventral cord behind the\r\n    subœsophageal ganglion are fused into a single ganglionic\r\n    mass.—After Brandt, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Collembola, which are retrograde Thysanura, there are from one\r\n(Smynthurus), to three or four ventral ganglia.\r\n\r\nIn the winged insects, where the ganglia are more or less fused, the\r\nfusion taking place in the head and at the end of the abdomen; there are\r\nin the more simple and generalized forms, such as Ephemera, the\r\ngrasshopper, locusts (Fig. 240), etc., thirteen ganglia besides the two\r\npairs of compound ganglia in the head, three pairs of thoracic ganglia,\r\nand usually from five to eight pairs of ganglia in the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 243.—Nervous system of the May beetle, _Lachnosterna fusca_:\r\n    _w^1_, nerve to 1st,—_w^2_, nerve to 2d, pair of wings; _ig_,\r\n    infraœsophageal ganglion.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 244.—The same of the stag-beetle, _Lucanus dama_, where there are\r\n    3 thoracic, and 3 separate abdominal ganglia.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn certain winged insects the process of fusion or degeneration is\r\ncarried to such an extreme that there are either no abdominal ganglia\r\n(Fig. 242, _D_), or their vestiges are situated in the thorax and\r\npartially fused with the thoracic ones, as in the May beetle, in which\r\nthe prothoracic pair of ganglia is separate, while the two other\r\nthoracic ganglia are fused with the abdominal, the latter being situated\r\nin the thorax; this fusion is carried to a further extent than in any\r\nother Coleoptera yet examined. In many Diptera and Hemiptera the\r\nabdominal ganglia are either absent or the vestiges are fused with the\r\nthoracic ganglia.\r\n\r\nRhizotrogus, which is allied to our May beetle, as also Hydrometra and\r\nthe Stylopidæ are said to lack the subœsophageal ganglion (Brandt).\r\n\r\nIn numerous Coleoptera (Acilius, Gyrinus, Necrophorus, Melolontha,\r\nBostrichus, Rhynchænus); in many Diptera (Culex, Tipula, Asilus,\r\nXylophaga, and Phora); and in the higher Hymenoptera (Crabronidæ,\r\nVespidæ, and Apidæ), as well as in many Lepidoptera (Vanessa, Argynnis,\r\nand Pontia), two of the thoracic ganglia are fused together, while all\r\nthree are partially fused into a single mass in many brachycerous\r\nDiptera (Conops, Syrphus, Pangonia, and the Muscidæ); in certain\r\nHemiptera (Pentatoma, Nepa, and Acanthia); also in a beetle (_Serica\r\nbrunnea_). Sometimes the subœsophageal ganglion is fused with the first\r\nthoracic, as in Acanthia, Nepa, and Notonecta. The greatest amount of\r\nvariation is seen in the number of abdominal ganglia, all being fused\r\ninto a single one or from one to eight. The fusion is usually greatest\r\nwhere the abdomen is shortened, due to the partial atrophy and\r\nmodification of the terminal segments which bear the ovipositor, where\r\npresent, and the genital armature.\r\n\r\nThere is only one pair of abdominal ganglia in Gyrinus and in certain\r\nflies (Conops, Trypeta, Ortalis, and Phora); two in Rhynchænus, a\r\nweevil, and in the flies, Syrphus and Volucella; three in Crabro and\r\nEucera; four in Sargus, Stratiomys and in butterflies, five in the\r\nbeetle, Silpha, and in the fly, Sciara, and the moth, Hepialus.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system in the larvæ of the metabolous orders is not\r\nconcentrated, though in that of the neuropterous Myrmeleo it has\r\nundergone fusion from adaptation to the short compressed form of this\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _b._ The brain\r\n\r\nThe brain of insects appears to be nearly, if not quite, as complex as\r\nthat of the lower vertebrates. As in the latter, the pair of\r\nsupraœsophageal ganglia, or brain, is the principal seat of the senses,\r\nthe chief organ of the insect’s mind.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of a larger number of pairs of primitive ganglia than any\r\nof the succeeding nerve-centres, and is, structurally, entirely\r\ndifferent from and far more complicated than the other ganglia of the\r\nnervous system. It possesses a central body in each hemisphere, a\r\n“mushroom body,” optic lobes and optic ganglia and olfactory lobe, with\r\ntheir connecting and commissural nerve-fibres, and a number of other\r\nparts not found in the other ganglia.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding ganglia the lobes are in general motor; the fibres\r\ncomposing the œsophageal commissures, and which arise from the\r\nœsophageal commissural lobes, extend not only to the subœsophageal\r\nganglion, but pass along through the succeeding ganglia to the last pair\r\nof abdominal nerve-centres.[40] Since, then, there is a direct\r\ncontinuity in the fibres forming the two main longitudinal commissures\r\nof the nervous cord, and which originate in the brain, it seems to\r\nfollow that the movements of the body are in large part directed or\r\ncoördinated by the brain.[41] Still, however, a second brain, so to\r\nspeak, is found in the third thoracic ganglion of the locust, which\r\nreceives the auditory nerves from the ears situated in the base of the\r\nabdomen; or in the first thoracic ganglion of the green grasshoppers\r\n(katydids, etc.), whose ears are situated in their fore legs; while even\r\nthe last pair of abdominal ganglia in the cockroach and mole cricket,\r\nis, so to speak, a secondary brain, since it distributes sensory nerves\r\nto the caudal stylets, which are provided with organs probably olfactory\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand the morphology of the brain unless we\r\nexamine the mode of origin of the nervous system in the early life of\r\nthe embryo. The head of an embryo insect consists of six segments,\r\n_i.e._ the ocular, antennal, premandibular, mandibular, and the 1st and\r\n2d maxillary segments, so named from the appendages they bear. Of these\r\nthe first three in the larva and adult are preoral, and the last three\r\nare postoral. The antennal segment was probably either postoral in the\r\nprogenitors of insects, or the antennæ were inserted on the side of the\r\nmouth, the latter finally moving back.[42]\r\n\r\nThe nervous system in the early embryonic condition, as shown by Wheeler\r\n(Fig. 245), at first consists of nineteen pairs of primitive ganglia,\r\ncalled _neuromeres_. Those of the head, which later in embryonic life\r\nfuse together to form the brain, are the first three, corresponding to\r\nthe _protocerebrum_, _deutocerebrum_, and _tritocerebrum_ of Viallanes.\r\nThe first pair of primitive ganglia, and which is situated in front of\r\nthe mouth, is divided into three lobes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 245, _A-D_.—Diagrams of four consecutive stages in the\r\n    development of the brain and nerve-chain of the embryo of Xiphidium:\r\n    I, cephalic,—II, thoracic,—III, abdominal, region; _st_, stomodæum\r\n    or primitive mouth; _an_, anus; _e_, optic plate; _pc(og)_, 1st\r\n    protocerebral lobe, or optic ganglion; _pc^2_, _pc^3_, 2d and 3d\r\n    protocerebral lobes; _dc_, deutocerebrum; _tc_, tritocerebrum; 1–16,\r\n    the 16 postoral ganglia; _po. c_, postoral commissure; _fp_, furcal\r\n    pit; _ac_, anterior,—_pc_, posterior, ganglionic commissure; _ag_,\r\n    anterior,—_pg_, posterior,—_cg_, central,—_lg_, lateral\r\n    gangliomeres.—After Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first or outermost lobe, according to Wheeler, forms the optic\r\nganglion of the larva and imago, while the second and third lobes.\r\n(_pc^2_, _pc^3_) ultimately form the bulk of the brain proper, or the\r\nprotocerebral lobes. The second (primitively postoral) brain-segment or\r\npair of ganglia gives origin to the antennæ, while the third brain, or\r\npremandibular (intercalary) segment, gives origin to a temporary\r\nembryonic pair of appendages found in Anurida and Campodea (the\r\npremandibular ganglia), and also to the nerves supplying the labrum.\r\nThese three pairs of ganglia later on in embryonic life become preoral,\r\nthe mouth moving backwards. The three pairs of primitive ganglia,\r\nbehind, _i.e._ the mandibular and 1st and 2d maxillary ganglia, become\r\nfused together to form the subœsophageal ganglion, and which in larval\r\nand adult life is postoral.\r\n\r\nIf the tongue (ligula, or hypopharynx) represents a distinct pair of\r\nappendages, then there are seven segments in the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 246.—Section through head of a carabid, _Anopthalmus telkampfii_:\r\n    _br_, brain; _fg_, frontal ganglion; _soe_, subœsophageal ganglion;\r\n    _co_, commissure; _n_. _l_, nerve sending branches to the lingua\r\n    (_l_); _mn_, maxillary nerve; _mx_, 1st maxilla; _mm_, maxillary\r\n    muscle; _mx′_ 2d maxilla; _mt_, muscle of mentum; _le_, elevator\r\n    muscle of the œsophagus; _l′_ of the clypeus, and a third beyond\r\n    raising the labrum (_lbr_); _eph_, epipharynx; _g. g′_, salivary\r\n    glands above; _g^2_, lingual gland below the œsophagus (_œ_); _m_,\r\n    mouth; _pv_, proventriculus; _md_, mandible.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe brain, then, supplies nerves to the compound and simple eyes, and to\r\nthe antennæ, and gives origin to the sympathetic nerves; it is thus the\r\nseat of the senses, also of the insect’s mind, and coördinates the\r\ngeneral movements of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 247.—Median longitudinal section through the head of _Blatta\r\n    orientalis_.

Procerebral lobes.\r\n     2. Optic ganglia.\r\n     3. Layer of postretinal fibres.\r\n     4. Ganglionic plate. (_Periopticon_ of Hickson.)\r\n     5. External chiasma.\r\n     6.

The last is attached to\r\nthe internal medullary mass (_mi_) by fibres (_chi_), some of which are\r\nchiasmatic, and others direct. Finally, the internal medullary mass\r\nconnects with the median part of the protocerebrum by direct fibres\r\nforming the optic nerve or tract (_to_).\r\n\r\n=Procerebral lobes.=—The median procerebral lobes are fused together on\r\nthe median line, forming a single central mass. From each side or lobe\r\narises the mushroom or stalked body. In the middle of the mass is the\r\ncentral body, and directly in front is the procerebral bridge (_plp_).\r\nThe latter is a band uniting the two halves of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe procerebral lobes also give origin to the nerves to the ocelli\r\n(_no_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 250.—Transverse section through the brain of the locust (Œdipoda\r\n    and Caloptenus): _c′_, lower part of the wall of _c_, calyx;—_st_,\r\n    stalk of the same; _bpcl_, bridge of the protocerebral lobes; _mo_,\r\n    nerve of median ocellus; _ch_, transverse fascia of the\r\n    optico-olfactory chiasma; _fcb_, fibrous region of the central body;\r\n    _lcb_, tubercle of the central body; _fch_, descending fascia of the\r\n    optico-olfactory chiasma; _choo_, superior fascia of the\r\n    optico-olfactory chiasma; _pt_, protocerebral lobes; _ld_, dorsal\r\n    lobe of the deutocerebrum; _lt_, tritocerebral lobe; _gcld_, _gc_,\r\n    ganglion cells.—After Viallanes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The mushroom or stalked bodies.=—These remarkable organs were first\r\ndiscovered by Dujardin, who compared them to mushrooms, and observed\r\nthat they were more highly developed in ants, wasps, and bees than in\r\nthe lower insects, and thus inferred that the higher intelligence of\r\nthese insects was in direct relation to the development of these bodies.\r\nWe will call them the _mushroom bodies_.\r\n\r\nThese two bodies consist of a rounded lobular mass (the trabecula) of\r\nthe procerebral lobe, from which arises a double stalk (Fig. 253), the\r\nlarger called the _cauliculus_, the smaller the _peduncle_ (or pedicel);\r\nthese support the cap or _calyx_. The calices of the bee were compared\r\nby Dujardin to a pair of disks on each side of the brain as seen from\r\nabove, “each disk being folded together and bent downwards before and\r\nbehind, its border being thickened, and the inner portion radiated.” In\r\nthe locust there are but two divisions of the calyx; in the cockroach,\r\nants, wasps, and bees, four.\r\n\r\nThe shape and relation of the mushroom bodies are represented in Figs.\r\n252 and 253. The bodies are connected by commissural fibres, and are\r\nconnected with the optic ganglion of the same side, and with the central\r\nbody; while they are connected with the antennal lobes by the\r\noptico-olfactory chiasma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 251.—Sagittal section through the brain of the locust: _l. oc.\r\n    n_, lateral ocellus nerve; _a. t_, anterior tubercle of the mushroom\r\n    body; _i. t_, internal tubercle of the mushroom body; _c. l_,\r\n    cerebral lobes; _l. l_, lateral lobe of the middle protocerebrum;\r\n    _com_, commissural cord; _c. mol_, central mass of the olfactory\r\n    lobe; _ac. an. l_, fibres uniting the median lobe of the middle\r\n    protocerebrum with dorsal lobes of the deutocerebrum; _gc. trit. l_,\r\n    ganglionated cortex of the tritocerebral lobe; _c. an. l_, cortex of\r\n    antennal (olfactory) lobe; _lab. fr_, labrofrontal nerve; _oe. com_,\r\n    œsophageal commissure; _tr. com_, transverse commissure of\r\n    œsophageal ring; other letters as in Fig. 250.—After Viallanes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe stalked bodies are enveloped by the cortical layers of\r\nganglion-cells, those filling the hollow of the calyx having little or\r\nno protoplasm around the nucleus.\r\n\r\n  =Structure of the mushroom bodies.=—By staining the brain of the\r\n  honey bee with bichromate of silver, Kenyon has worked out the\r\n  structure of the mushroom bodies, with their cells. The cup-shaped\r\n  bodies or calyces are composed of fibrillar substance\r\n  (_punktsubstanz_). Each of these cups, he says, is “filled to\r\n  overflowing with cells having large nuclei and very little\r\n  cytoplasm.” From the under surface of each of these cups there\r\n  descends into the general fibrillar substance of the brain “a column\r\n  of fibrillar substance, which unites with its fellow of the same\r\n  side to send a large branch obliquely downward to the median line of\r\n  the brain, and an equally large or larger branch straight forwards\r\n  to the anterior cerebral surface.”\r\n\r\n  The cells of the mushroom bodies, observes Kenyon, “stand out in\r\n  sharp contrast to all other nerve cells known, though they recall to\r\n  some extent the cells of Purkinje in the higher mammals. Each of the\r\n  cells contained within the fibrillar cup sends a nerve-process into\r\n  the latter, where it breaks up into a profusely arborescent system\r\n  of branchlets, which often appear with fine, short, lateral\r\n  processes, such as are characteristic of the dendrites of some\r\n  mammalian nerve-cells.” Just before entering the fibrillar\r\n  substance, a fine branch is given off that travels along the inner\r\n  surface of the cup along with others of the same nature, forming a\r\n  small bundle to the stalk of the mushroom body, down which it\r\n  continues until it reaches the origin of the anterior and the inner\r\n  roots above mentioned. “Here it branches, one branch continuing\r\n  straight on to the end of the anterior root, while the other passes\r\n  to the end of the inner root. Throughout its whole course the fibre\r\n  and its two branches are very fine. Nearly the whole stalk and\r\n  nearly the whole of each root is made up of these straight, parallel\r\n  fibres coming from the cells within the cup of the mushroom bodies.\r\n  What other fibres there are enter these bodies from the side, and\r\n  branch between the straight fibres very much as the dendrites of the\r\n  cells of Purkinje branch among the parallel fine fibres from the\r\n  cells of the granular layer in the mammalian cerebellum. These\r\n  fibres are of the nature of association fibres.”\r\n\r\n  Viallanes showed that from the olfactory or antennal lobes, as well\r\n  as from the optic ganglia, there are tracts of fibres which finally\r\n  enter the cups of the mushroom bodies, and Kenyon has confirmed this\r\n  observation. Kenyon has also, by the Golgi method, detected another\r\n  tract, before unknown, “passing down the hinder side of the brain,\r\n  from the cups to the region above the œsophagus, where it bends\r\n  forward and comes in contact with fibres from the ventral cord,\r\n  which exists, although Binet was unable to discover any growth of\r\n  fibres connecting the cord with the brain.\r\n\r\n  “The fibres entering the cups from the antennal lobe, the optic\r\n  ganglia, and the ventral region, spread out and branch among the\r\n  arborescent endings of the mushroom-body cells. The fibres branching\r\n  among the parallel fibres of the roots and the stalk lead off to\r\n  lower parts of the brain, connecting with efferent or motor-fibres,\r\n  or with secondary association fibres, that in their turn make such\r\n  connections. This portion of the circuit has not been perfectly made\r\n  out, though there seems to be sufficient data to warrant the\r\n  assumption just made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 252.—Section 17, showing the central body (_centr. b_) and\r\n    mushroom body, optic and antennal lobes (_a. l_), and procerebral\r\n    lobes (_pc. l_); _o. cal_, outer division of the calyx; _op. n_,\r\n    optic nerve; _trab_, trabeculum; _tc. n_, transverse nerve.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Such fibres existing as described, there is then a complete circuit\r\n  for sensory stimuli from the various parts of the body to the cells\r\n  of the mushroom bodies. The dendritic or arborescent branches of\r\n  these cells take them up and pass them on out along the parallel\r\n  fibres or neurites in the roots of the mushroom bodies as motor or\r\n  other efferent impulses.\r\n\r\n  “This, however, is not all. For there are numerous fibres evident in\r\n  my preparations, the full courses of which I have not been thus far\r\n  able to determine, but which are so situated as to warrant the\r\n  inference that they may act as association fibres between the\r\n  afferent fibres from the antennæ, optic ganglia, and ventral system,\r\n  and the efferent fibres. There is then a possibility of a stimulus\r\n  entering the brain and passing out as a motor impulse without going\r\n  into the circuit of the fibres of the mushroom bodies; or, in other\r\n  words, a possibility of what may be compared to reflex action in\r\n  higher animals.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 253.—Enlarged view of the trabeculum (the dotted lines _tcn_ and\r\n    _obt. n_ pass through it) and its nerves, of the mushroom body,—its\r\n    calices and stalk, and the origin of the optic nerve × 225\r\n    diameters: _atn_, ascending trabecular nerve; _obt. n_, oblique\r\n    trabecular nerve; _tcn_, transverse nerve; _lat. n_, lateral nerve;\r\n    _cent. n_, central nerve.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mushroom bodies have not yet been found to be present in the\r\nSynaptera, but occur in the larvæ, at least of those of most metamorphic\r\ninsects (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), though not yet found in the larvæ\r\nof Diptera. The writer has found these bodies in the nymphs of the\r\nlocust (_Melanoplus spretus_), but not in the embryo just before\r\nhatching. They occur in the third larval or nymph stage of this insect.\r\nIt is evident that by the end of the first larval stage the brain\r\nattains the development seen in the third larval state of the two-banded\r\nspecies (_C. bivittatus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 254.—Section through the brain of _Caloptenus bivittatus_ in the\r\n    third larval stage, showing the two hemispheres or sides of the\r\n    brain, and the ocelli and ocellar nerves, which are seen to arise\r\n    from the top of the hemispheres directly over the calices (compare\r\n    Fig. 251): _o. cal_, outer division of calyx of left mushroom body.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe result of our studies on the brain of the embryo locust was that\r\nfrom the embryonic cerebral lobes are eventually developed the central\r\nbody and the two mushroom bodies. Fig. 254 shows the early condition of\r\nthe mushroom bodies and their undoubted origin from the cerebral\r\nganglia. Hence these bodies appear to be differentiations of the\r\ncerebral ganglia or lobes, having no connection with the optic or\r\nantennal lobes.\r\n\r\n=The central body= (Fig. 252, _centr. b_).—This is the only single or\r\nunpaired organ in the brain. Dietl characterizes it as a median\r\ncommissural system. Viallanes describes it as formed entirely of a very\r\nfine and close fibrillar web, like a thick hemispherical skull-cap,\r\nsituated on the median line and united with the cerebral lobes. “It is\r\nlike a central post towards which converge fibres passing from all\r\npoints of the brain; being bound to the cerebral lobes, to the stalked\r\nbodies, to the optic ganglia, and to the olfactory lobes by distinct\r\nfibrous bundles.”\r\n\r\n=The antennal or olfactory lobes (Deutocerebrum).=—This portion of the\r\nbrain consists of two hemispherical lobes, highly differentiated for\r\nspecial sensorial perceptions, and connected by a slightly\r\ndifferentiated medullary mass, the dorsal lobe (Figs. 248, 249 _lo_),\r\nfrom which arise the motor fibres and those of general sensibility. The\r\nantennal lobes are in part attached to the optic ganglia, and partly to\r\nthe stalked body on the same side, by the optic olfactory chiasma (Fig.\r\n250 _fch_, _choo_), a system of fibres partially intercrossed on the\r\nmedian line.\r\n\r\n=The œsophageal lobes (Tritocerebrum)= (Figs. 249, 250).—From this\r\nregion the labrum and viscera are innervated, the nerves to the latter\r\nbeing called the visceral, sympathetic, or stomatogastric system. As\r\nViallanes remarks, though plainly situated in front of the mouth, they\r\nare in fact post-œsophageal centres. The two lobes are situated far\r\napart, and are connected by a bundle of fibres passing behind the\r\nœsophagus, called the transverse commissure of the œsophageal ring\r\n(Lienard). The œsophageal ganglia, besides giving rise to the labral\r\nnerves, also give origin to the root of the frontal ganglion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _c._ Histological elements of the brain\r\n\r\nThe brain and other ganglia are composed of two kinds of tissue.\r\n\r\n1. The outer slightly darker, usually pale grayish white portion\r\nconsists of cortical or ganglion-cells differing in size. This portion\r\nis stained red by carmine, the cells composing it readily taking the\r\nstain.\r\n\r\nThe large ganglion cells (represented in Figs. 252 and 253) are oval,\r\nand send off usually a single nerve-fibre; they have a thin fibrous\r\ncell-wall, and the contents are finely granular. The nucleus is very\r\nlarge, often one-half the diameter of the entire cell, and is composed\r\nof large round refractive granules, usually concealing the nucleolus.\r\n\r\n2. The medullary or inner part of the brain consists of matter which\r\nremains white or unstained after the preparation has remained thoroughly\r\nexposed to the action of the carmine. It consists of minute granules and\r\ninterlacing fibres. The latter often forms a fine irregular network\r\ninclosing masses of finely granulated nerve matter.\r\n\r\n  This is called by Dietl “marksubstanz.” Leydig, in his Vom Bau des\r\n  thierischen Körpers, p. 89, thus refers to it:—\r\n\r\n  “In the brain and ventral ganglia of the leech, of insects, and\r\n  in the brain of the gastropods (Schnecken) I observe that the\r\n  stalks (stiele) of the ganglion-cells in nowise immediately\r\n  arise as nerve-fibres, but are planted in a molecular mass or\r\n  _punktsubstanz_, situated in the centre of the ganglion, and\r\n  merged with this substance. It follows, from what I have seen,\r\n  that there is no doubt that _the origin of the nerve-fibres\r\n  first takes place from this central punktsubstanz_.”\r\n\r\n  “This relation is the rule. But there also occur in the\r\n  nerve-centres of the invertebrates single, definitely situated\r\n  ganglion-cells, whose continuations become nerve-fibres without the\r\n  intervention of a superadded _punktsubstanz_.” We may, with Kenyon,\r\n  call it the fibrillar substance.\r\n\r\n  Leydig subsequently (p. 91) further describes this fibrillar\r\n  substance, stating that the granules composing it form a reticulated\r\n  mass of fibrillæ, or, in other words, a tangled web of very fine\r\n  fibres:—\r\n\r\n  “We at present consider that by the passage of the continuation of\r\n  the ganglion-cells into the _punktsubstanz_ this continuation\r\n  becomes lost in the fine threads, and on the other side of the\r\n  _punktsubstanz_ the similar fibrillar substance forms the origin of\r\n  the axis-cylinders arranged parallel to one another; so it is quite\r\n  certain _that the single axis-cylinder derives its fibrillar\r\n  substance as a mixture from the most diverse ganglion-cells_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        _d._ The visceral (sympathetic or stomatogastric) system\r\n\r\nThis system in insects is composed (1) of a series of three unpaired\r\nganglia (Fig. 249, _gv^1_, _gv^2_, _gv^3_), situated over the\r\ndorso-median line of the œsophagus, and connected by a median nervous\r\ncord or recurrent nerve (_nr_, _vagus_ of Newport). The first of these\r\nganglia is the frontal ganglion, which is connected with the œsophageal\r\nganglia by a pair of roots (_rvt_), which have an origin primitively\r\ncommon with that of the labral nerves (Fig. 248, _fg_ and _lbr_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 255.—Anterior portion of the paired and unpaired visceral nervous\r\n    system of _Blatta orientalis_ seen from above. The outlines of the\r\n    brain (_g_) and the roots of the antennal nerve (_na_), which cover\r\n    a portion of the sympathetic nervous system, are given by dotted\r\n    lines. Lettering as in Fig. 247. _nsd_, nerve to salivary gland. The\r\n    nervus recurrens (_nr_) enters an unpaired stomach ganglion farther\r\n    back.—After Hofer, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. Of two pairs of lateral ganglia (Fig. 255, _ga_, _gp_) situated two\r\non each side of the œsophagus. They are connected both with the antennal\r\nlobes by a nerve (_rvd_), and to the chain of unpaired ganglia by a\r\nspecial connective. The first pair of these ganglia sends nerves to the\r\nheart and aorta; the second pair to the tracheæ of the head.\r\n\r\nThe unpaired median or recurrent nerve (_nr_) extends back from under\r\nthe brain along the upper side of the œsophagus, and (in Blatta), behind\r\nthe origin of the nerves to the salivary glands, enters an unpaired\r\nganglion, called the stomachic ganglion (_ganglion ventriculare_),\r\nsituated in front of the proventriculus. The number of these stomachic\r\nganglia varies in different orders of insects.\r\n\r\n  In Blatta, Küpffer and also Hofer have shown (Fig. 255) (Müller,\r\n  Brandt, _ex_ Kolbe) that the nerve to each salivary gland arises\r\n  from three different centres: the anterior end situated under the\r\n  œsophagus is innervated by the paired visceral nerves from the\r\n  hinder paired ganglia; the remaining part by nerves arising from\r\n  each side of the recurrent nerve; and thirdly by a pair of nerves\r\n  arising from the subœsophageal ganglion which accompanies the common\r\n  salivary duct, and ends in branches which partly innervate the\r\n  salivary glands and in part their muscles.\r\n\r\nHofer considers that the function of this complex system of paired and\r\nunpaired ganglia, with their nerves, is a double one, viz. serving both\r\nas a centre for the peristaltic action of the œsophagus, and as\r\ninnervating the salivary glands.\r\n\r\nBesides these a second portion of the visceral system arises from the\r\nthoracic and abdominal ventral cord. It may be seen in the simplest\r\ncondition yet known in the nervous system of Machilis (Fig. 239 _s_). It\r\nconsists of a fine, slender nerve, which extends along the surface of\r\nthe ventral chain of ganglia, and sending off a pair of branches\r\n(accessory transverse nerves) in front of each ganglion. These accessory\r\nnerves receive nerve-twigs from the upper cord of the ventral chain,\r\ndilating near their origins into a minute elongated ganglion, and then\r\npassing partly outwards to the branches of the tracheæ and the muscles\r\nof the spiracles, uniting in the middle line of each segment of the body\r\nbehind the head, _i.e._ of those segments containing a pair of ganglia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _e._ The supraspinal cord\r\n\r\nIn the adult Lepidoptera has been detected, continuous with and on the\r\nupper side of the abdominal portions of the ventral cord, a longitudinal\r\ncord of connective tissue forming a white or yellowish band, and which\r\nseems to be an outgrowth of the dorsal portion of the neurilemma of the\r\nventral cord. Muscles pass from it to the neighboring ventral portions\r\nof the integument. Its use is unknown, and attention was first called to\r\nit by Treviranus, who called it “an unknown ventral vessel”\r\n(_Bauchgefäss_). Afterwards it was re-discovered by Newport, who\r\ndescribed it as “a distinct vascular canal.” But Burger has proved by\r\ncross-sections that it is not tubular, but a comparatively solid cord\r\ncomposed, however, of loose connective tissue. Newport found it in the\r\nlarva of _Sphinx ligustri_, but Cattie states that it is not present in\r\nthat of _Acherontia atropos_. It has not yet been observed in insects of\r\nother orders, but its homologue exists in the scorpion and in the\r\ncentipede, and it may prove to correspond with the far more complete\r\narterial coat which, with the exception of the brain, envelops the\r\nnervous system of Limulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _f._ Modifications of the brain in different orders of insects\r\n\r\nThere are different grades of cerebral development in insects, and\r\nViallanes claimed that it was no exaggeration to say that the brain of\r\nthe locust (Melanoplus) differs as much from that of the wasp as that of\r\nthe frog differs from that of man. He insists that the physiological\r\nconditions which determine the anatomical modifications of the brain are\r\ncorrelated with 1, the food; 2, the perfection of the senses; and 3,\r\nwith the perfection of the psychic faculties. For example, in those\r\nwhich feed on solid food and whose œsophagus is large (Orthoptera and\r\nColeoptera), the connectives are elongated, the subœsophageal commissure\r\nfree in all its extent, and the tritocerebrum is situated quite far from\r\nthe preceding segment of the brain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in insects which feed on fluid food (Hymenoptera,\r\nLepidoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera), the œsophagus is slender and the\r\nnervous centres which surround them are very much condensed; the\r\nconnectives are short, and the tritocerebrum is closely fused, partly to\r\na portion of the antennal lobes (deutocerebrum) and partly to the\r\nmandibular ganglion.\r\n\r\nAs regards the perfection of the senses, where, as in dragon-flies, the\r\neyes are very large, the optic ganglia are correspondingly so, and in\r\nthe same insects the antennæ being very small, the antennal lobes are\r\nalmost rudimentary. The ants exhibit inverse conditions; in their brain\r\nthe antennal lobes are well developed, while the optic ganglia are\r\nreduced, and where, as in Typhlopone, the eyes are wanting, they are\r\ncompletely atrophied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 256.—Head of _Anophthalmus tellkampfii_, showing the brain,—the\r\n    optic ganglia, nerves, and eyes totally atrophied.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 257.—Head of another Carabid, with the brain and eyes normal:\r\n    _op_, optic ganglion; _pcl_, brain.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn certain cave insects where the eyes are wanting, the optic ganglia\r\nare also absent. In the eyeless cave species of Anophthalmus the optic\r\nganglia and nerves are entirely atrophied, as they are in Adelops,\r\nwhich, however, has vestiges of the facets (ommatidia). Fig. 257\r\nrepresents the brain of _Chlænius pennsylvanicus_, a Carabid beetle,\r\nwith its eyes and optic ganglia (_op_) which may be compared with\r\nAnopthalmus, in which these parts are totally atrophied.\r\n\r\nDujardin claimed that the degree of complication of the stalked body of\r\nthe Hymenoptera was in direct relation with their mental powers. This\r\nhas been proved by Forel, who has shown that in the honey bee and ants\r\nthe mushroom bodies are much more developed in the workers than in the\r\nmales or females and Viallanes adds that these bodies are almost\r\nrudimentary in the dragon-flies, whose eyes are so large; while on the\r\ncontrary in the blind ants (Typhlopone), these bodies are as perfect and\r\nvoluminous as in the ants with eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 258.—Diagrammatic outlines of sections of the upper part of the\r\n    brain of a cockroach.

Thus in the Orthoptera, says Viallanes,\r\nthe Blattæ, Forficulæ, and the crickets, the mushroom bodies are more\r\nperfect than in the locusts, which have simpler herbivorous habits. This\r\nperfection of the mushroom bodies is seen not only in the increase in\r\nsize, but also in the complication of its structures. Thus in the groups\r\nwith lower instincts (Tabanus, Æschna) the stalk does not end in a calyx\r\nprojecting from the surface of the brain, but its end, simply truncated,\r\nis indicated externally only by an accumulation of the ganglionic nuclei\r\nwhich cover it.[43]\r\n\r\nIn types which Viallanes regards as more advanced, _i.e._ Œdipoda and\r\nMelanoplus, the end of the stalk projects and is folded into a calyx.\r\n\r\nThe brain of the cockroach (Periplaneta, Fig. 258) is a step higher than\r\nthat of the locusts, each calyx being divided into two adjacent calices,\r\nalthough the cockroaches are an older and more generalized type than\r\nlocusts.\r\n\r\nThe stalked bodies of cockroaches are thus complex, like those of the\r\nhigher Hymenoptera, the calices in Xylocopa, Bombus, and Apis being\r\ndouble and so large as to cover almost the entire surface of the brain.\r\n\r\nFinally, in what Viallanes regards as the most perfect type (Vespa), the\r\nsides of the calices are folded and become sinuous, so as to increase\r\nthe surface, thus assuming an appearance which, he claims, strongly\r\nrecalls that of the convolutions of the brain of the mammals.\r\n\r\n  Cheshire also calls attention to a progression in the size of these\r\n  appendages, as well as in mental powers as we rise from the\r\n  cockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_) to the cricket, up to the\r\n  ichneumon, then to the carpenter bee, and finally to the social hive\r\n  bee, “where the pedunculated bodies form the ⅕ part of the volume of\r\n  the cerebral mass, and the 1⁄870 of the volume of the entire\r\n  creature, while in the cockchafer they are less than 1⁄2300 the\r\n  part. The size of the brain is also a gauge of intelligence. In the\r\n  worker bee the brain is 1⁄174 of the body; in the red ant, 1⁄296; in\r\n  the Melolontha, 1⁄3500; in the Dyticus beetle, 1⁄4400.” (Bees and\r\n  bee-keeping, p. 54.)\r\n\r\n\r\n             _g._ Functions of the nerve-centres and nerves\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the central seat of the functions of the nervous system\r\nis not the brain alone (supraœsophageal ganglion), but each ganglion is\r\nmore or less the seat of vital movements, those of the abdomen being\r\neach a distinct motor and respiratory centre. The two halves of a\r\nganglion are independent of each other.\r\n\r\nAccording to Faivre, the brain is the seat of the will and of the power\r\nof coördinating the movements of the body, while the infraœsophageal\r\nganglion is the seat of the motive power and also of the will.\r\n\r\nThe physiological experiments of Binet, which are in the line of those\r\nof Faivre, but more thorough, demonstrate that an insect may live for\r\nmonths without a brain, if the subœsophageal ganglion is left intact,\r\njust as a vertebrate may exist without its cerebrum. As Kenyon says:\r\n“Faivre long ago showed that the subœsophageal ganglion is the seat of\r\nthe power of coördination of the muscular movements of the body. Binet\r\nhas shown that the brain is the seat of the power directing these\r\nmovements. ‘A debrained hexapod will eat when food is placed beneath its\r\npalpi, but it cannot go to its food even though the latter be but a very\r\nsmall space removed from its course or position. Whether the insect\r\nwould be able to do so if the mushroom bodies only were destroyed, and\r\nthe antennal lobes, optic lobes, and the rest of the brain were left\r\nintact, is a question that yet remains to be answered’” (Kenyon).\r\n\r\nIn insects which are beheaded, however readily they respond to\r\nstimulation of the nerves, they are almost completely wanting in will\r\npower. Yet insects which have been decapitated can still walk and fly.\r\nHymenoptera will live one or two days after decapitation, beetles from\r\none to three days, and moths (Agrotis) will show signs of life five days\r\nafter the loss of their head.\r\n\r\nThat the loss of will power is gradual was proved by decapitating\r\n_Polistes pallipes_. A day after the operation she was standing on her\r\nlegs and opening and closing her wings; 41 hours after the operation she\r\nwas still alive, moving her legs, and thrusting out her sting when\r\nirritated. _Ichneumon otiosus_, after the removal of its head, remained\r\nvery lively, and cleaned its wings and legs, the power of coördination\r\nin its wings and legs remaining. A horse-fly, a day after decapitation,\r\nwas lively and flew about in a natural manner.[44]\r\n\r\nWhen the abdomen is cut off, respiration in that region is not at first\r\ninterrupted. The seat of respiratory movements was referred by Faivre to\r\nthe hinder thoracic ganglion, but Plateau says that this view must be\r\nentirely abandoned, remarking: “All carefully performed experiments on\r\nthe nervous system of Arthropoda have shown that each ganglion of the\r\nventral chain is a motor centre, and in insects a respiratory centre,\r\nfor the somite to which it belongs” (Miall and Denny’s The Cockroach, p.\r\n164).\r\n\r\nThe last pair of abdominal ganglia serve as the nervous centre of the\r\nnerves sent to the genital organs.\r\n\r\nThe recurrent or stomatogastric nerve, which, through the medium of the\r\nfrontal ganglion, regulates digestion, has only a slight degree of\r\nsensibility; the insect remains quiet even when a powerful allurement is\r\npresented to the digestive tract (Kolbe).\r\n\r\nFaivre states that the destruction of the frontal ganglion, or a section\r\nof the commissures connecting it with the brain, puts an end to\r\nswallowing movements; on the other hand, stimulation results in\r\nenergetic movements of this nature.\r\n\r\nYersin, by cutting through the commissure in different places, and thus\r\nisolating the ganglia of the nervous cord of _Gryllus campestris_,\r\narrived at the following results:—\r\n\r\n1. The section of a nerve near its origin rendered the organ supplied by\r\nthis nerve incapable of performing its functions.\r\n\r\n2. If the connectives between two ganglia, _i.e._ the second and third\r\nthoracic ganglia, are cut through, the fore as well as hinder parts of\r\nthe body retain their power of motion and sensation; but a stimulus\r\napplied to the anterior part of the body does not pass to the hinder\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n3. Insects with an incomplete metamorphosis after section of the\r\nconnectives are not in every case unable to moult and to farther\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n4. If only one of the two connectives be cut through, the appendages of\r\nthe side cut through which take their origin between the place injured\r\nand the hinder end of the body, often lose sensation and freedom of\r\nmotion, or the power of coördination of movements becomes irregular.\r\nSometimes this is shown by an unsteadiness in the gait, so that the\r\ninsect walks around in a circle; after a while these irregularities\r\ncease, and the movements of the limbs on the injured side are only\r\nslightly restrained. By a section of both connectives in any one place\r\nthe power of coördination of movements is not injured.\r\n\r\n5. The section of the connectives appear to have no influence on\r\nnutrition, but affects reproduction, the attempt at fertilization on the\r\npart of the male producing no result, and the impregnated female laying\r\nno eggs.\r\n\r\n6. Injury to the brain, or to the subœsophageal, or one of the thoracic\r\nganglia, is followed by a momentary enfeeblement of the ganglion\r\naffected. Afterwards there results a convulsive trembling, which either\r\npervades the whole body or only the appendages innervated by the injured\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\n7. As a result of an injury to the brain there is such a lack of\r\nsteadiness in the movements that the insect walks or flies in a circle;\r\nfor instance, a fly or dragon-fly thus injured in flying describes a\r\ncircle or spiral. Steiner, in making this experiment, observed that the\r\ninsect circled on its uninjured side. The brain is thus a motor centre.\r\n\r\n8. By injuring a thoracic ganglion, one or all the organs which receive\r\nnerves from the ganglion are momentarily weakened. Afterwards the\r\nfunctions become restored. Sometimes, however, the insect walks in a\r\ncircle. Faivre observed that after the destruction of the metathoracic\r\nganglion of _Dyticus marginalis_ the hind wings and hind legs were\r\npartially paralyzed (Kolbe, _ex_ Yersin).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LITERATURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _a._ General\r\n\r\n  =Newport, George.= On the nervous system of the _Sphinx ligustri_ L.,\r\n    and on the changes which it undergoes during a part of the\r\n    metamorphoses of the insect.

The compound\r\nor facetted eyes, which are usually round and prominent, differ much in\r\nsize and in the number of facets.\r\n\r\n  The number of facets varies from 12 in Lepisma,—though in a\r\n  Brazilian beetle (Lathridius) there are only seven unequal\r\n  facets,—to 50 in the ant, and up to 4000 in the house-fly, 12,000 in\r\n  _Acherontia atropos_, 17,000 in Papilio, 20,000 in the dragon-fly\r\n  (Æschna), 25,000 in a beetle (Mordella), while in _Sphinx\r\n  convolvuli_, the number reaches 27,000. The size of the facets seems\r\n  to bear some relation to that of the insect, but even in the\r\n  smallest species none have been observed less than 1⁄2000 of an inch\r\n  in diameter. Day-flying Lepidoptera have smaller facets than moths\r\n  (Lubbock).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 260.—Section through the ocellus of a young Dyticus larva: _ct_,\r\n    cuticula; _l_, corneal lens; _gh_, cells of the vitreous body, being\r\n    modified hypodermal cells (_hy_); _st_, rods; _re_, retinal cells;\r\n    _no_, optic nerve.—After Grenacher, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The simple, or single-lensed eye (ocellus).=—Morphologically the simple\r\neye is a modified portion of the ectoderm, the pigment enclosing the\r\nretinal cells arising from specialized hypodermal cells, and covered by\r\na specialized transparent portion of the cuticula, forming the corneal\r\nlens. The apparatus is supplied with a nerve, the fibres of which end in\r\na rod or solid nerve-ending, as in other sensory organs.\r\n\r\nAs seen in the ocellus of Dyticus (Fig. 260), under the corneal lens the\r\nhypodermis forms a sort of pit, and the cells are modified to form the\r\nvitreous body (vitrella) and retina. Each retinal cell (_re_) is\r\nconnected with a fibre from the optic nerve, contains pigment, and ends\r\nin a rod directed outwards towards the lens. The cells at the end of the\r\npit or depression are, next to the lens, without pigment, and, growing\r\nin between the retina and the lens, fill it up, and thus form a sort of\r\nvitreous body.\r\n\r\n  The ocellus appears to be a direct heirloom from the eyes of worms,\r\n  while the many-facetted compound eye of the crustaceans and of\r\n  insects is peculiar to these classes. The compound eye of the\r\n  myriopod Scutigera differs structurally in many respects from the\r\n  compound eye of insects, and that of Limulus still more so.\r\n\r\n  It should be observed that in the young nymph of Ephemera, as well\r\n  as in the semipupa of Bombus, each of the three ocelli are situated\r\n  on separate sclerites. In Bombus the anterior ocellus has a double\r\n  shape, being broad, transversely ovate, and not round like the two\r\n  others, as if resulting from the fusion of what were originally two\r\n  distinct ocelli.\r\n\r\n  The ocelli are not infrequently wanting, as in adult Dermaptera, in\r\n  the Locustidæ, and in certain Hemiptera (Hydrocora). In Lepidoptera\r\n  there are but two ocelli; in geometrid moths they are often\r\n  atrophied, and they are absent in butterflies (except Pamphila).\r\n\r\n=The compound or facetted eye (ommateum).=—The facetted arthropod eye is\r\nwonderfully complex and most delicately organized, being far more so\r\nthan that of vertebrates or molluscs. The simplest or most primitive\r\nfacetted eye appears to be that of Lepisma. As stated by Watase, the\r\ncompound eye of arthropods is morphologically “a collection of\r\nectodermic pits whose outer open ends face towards the sources of light,\r\nand whose inner ends are connected with the central nervous system by\r\nthe optic nerve fibres.”\r\n\r\nThe facetted eye is composed of numerous simple eyes called _ommatidia_,\r\neach of which is complicated in structure. The elements which make up an\r\n_ommatidium_ are the following: (1) The facet or cornea, which is a\r\nspecialized portion of the cuticula; and (2), the crystalline lens or\r\ncone; (3), the nerve-ending or _retinula_, which is formed out of the\r\nretinula cells and the _rhabdom_ or rod lying in its axis; and (4) of\r\nthe pigment enclosing the lens and rod; the last three elements are\r\nderived from the hypodermis. The single eyes are separated from each\r\nother by pigment cells.\r\n\r\n=The facet or cornea.=—This is biconvex, clear, transparent, usually\r\nhexagonal in outline, and refracts the light. The corneal lenses are\r\ncast in moulting.\r\n\r\n  The corneal lenses are circular in most cases where they are very\r\n  convex, as in Lathridius and Batocera. The hexagonal ones are very\r\n  irregular. When they are very convex the eye has a granular\r\n  appearance, but when not greater than the convexity of the eye\r\n  itself, the eye appears perfectly smooth (Bolbocerus, etc.). The\r\n  facets in the lower part of the eye of Dineutes are a trifle larger\r\n  than in the upper part (about nine to ten). In many insects the\r\n  reverse is the case, the upper facets being larger than the lower, a\r\n  notable instance being Anax. The intervening lines between the\r\n  facets are often beset with hairs, sometimes very long and dense, as\r\n  in the drone bee and Trichophthalmus; and the modifications of the\r\n  hairs into scales which takes place on the body occurs on the eyes\r\n  also, the scales on the eyes of some beetles of the family Colydiidæ\r\n  being very large, arranged in lines over the eyes like tombstones\r\n  (Trachypholis).[45]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 261.—Section through the eye of a fly (_Musca vomitoria_): _c_,\r\n    cornea, or facet; _pc_, pseudocone; _r_, retinula; _Rh_, rhabdom;\r\n    _pg^1_, _pg^2_, _pg^3_, pigment cells; _b.m_, basilar membrane; _T_,\r\n    _Tt_{1}_, _Tt_{2}_, trachea; _tv_, tracheal vesicle; _t.a_, terminal\r\n    anastomosis; _op_, opticon; _c.op_, epiopticon; _p.op_, periopticon;\r\n    _n.c_, nuclei; _n.c.s_, nerve-cell sheath; _N.f_, decussating\r\n    nerve-fibres.—After Hickson, from Lubbock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The crystalline lens or cone.=—Behind or within the facets is a layer\r\ncomposed of the cones, behind which are the layers of retinulæ and\r\nrhabdoms, and which correspond to the layer of rods and cones, but not\r\nthe retina as a whole, of vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline lens is, when present, usually more or less conical, and\r\nconsists of four or more hypodermis-cells.\r\n\r\nThe cones are of various shapes and sizes in insects of different\r\ngroups, or are entirely wanting, and Grenacher has divided the eyes of\r\ninsects into _eucone_, _pseudocone_, and _acone_. As the pseudocone\r\nseems, however, to be rather a modification of the eucone eye, the\r\nfollowing division may be made:—\r\n\r\n1. _Eucone eyes_, comprising those with a well-developed cone. They\r\noccur in Lepisma, Blatta (Fig. 262), and other Orthoptera, in\r\nNeuroptera, in Cicadidæ, in those Coleoptera with five tarsal joints, in\r\nthe dipterous genus Corethra, and in the Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera\r\n(Fig. 263).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 262.—Ommatidium of cockroach (Periplaneta): _lf_, cornea; _kk_,\r\n    crystalline cone; _pg′_ pigment cell; _rl_, retinula; _rm_,\r\n    rhabdom.—After Grenacher, from Lubbock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 263.—Two separate elements of the eucone eye of a bee; _Lf_,\r\n    cornea; _n_, nucleus of Semper; _Kk_, crystalline cone; _Pg_,\r\n    pigment cells; _Rl_, retinula; _Rm_, rhabdom.—After Grenacher, from\r\n    Lubbock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 264.—Three ommatidia of a pseudocone eye, diagrammatic: _A_, a\r\n    separate ommatidium of _Musca vomitoria_, semi-diagrammatic: _c_,\r\n    cornea; _p.c_, pseudocone; _pg′_, pigmented cells surrounding the\r\n    pseudocone; _p.g_{2}_, additional pigment cells; _p.g_{3}_, basal\r\n    pigment cells; _n.p.c_, nuclei of pseudocone; _r_, retinulæ; _n.r_,\r\n    _n.r′_, nucleus of retinulæ; _R_, rhabdom; _b.m_, basal membrane;\r\n    _t.a_, terminal anastomosis sending nerve-fibrils to the retinulæ.\r\n    _B_, section through a retinula and rhabdom near the basal membrane,\r\n    the six retinulæ (_r_) fused into a tube ensheathing the rhabdom\r\n    (_R_).—After Hickson.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_a._ Pseudocone eyes; in which, instead of the crystalline lens or cone,\r\nthere are four cells filled with a transparent fluid medium, and a\r\nsmaller protoplasmic portion containing a nucleus (Muscidæ, Fig. 264,\r\n_pc_). Hickson states that the difference between the eucone and\r\npseudocone eyes lies in the fact that in the pseudocone eye “the\r\nrefracting body formed by the cone-cell lies behind the nuclei,” and in\r\nthe eucone eye in front of it.\r\n\r\n2. _Acone eyes_, where the cone or refracting body is wanting, but is\r\nrepresented by the four primitive cone-cells. Acone eyes occur in\r\nForficulidæ, Hemiptera (except Cicadidæ), the nematocerous Diptera\r\n(Tipula, etc.), and those Coleoptera which have less than five tarsal\r\njoints.\r\n\r\n=The retinula and rod.=—The retinula is morphologically a nerve-end\r\ncell, situated at the end of a nerve-fibril arising from the optic\r\nnerve. The elements of the retinula of Musca are six in number and\r\nsurround the _rhabdom_ (Fig. 264), which consists of a bundle of six\r\nlong, delicate chitinous rods, more or less firmly united together (Fig.\r\n264, _R_).\r\n\r\nThe six elements of the retinula of Musca are in their outer or distal\r\nportion free from one another, but towards their base are fused into a\r\nsheath (Fig. 264, _r_). They are true nerve-end cells, as shown by\r\nMüller and by Max Schultze, their views having been confirmed by\r\nGrenacher and by Hickson. The relations of the nerves to the rods after\r\npassing through the basal membrane is seen in Fig. 266.\r\n\r\n=The pigment.=—The cones or pseudocones are mostly buried in pigment, as\r\nwell as the rods; and the pigment forms two layers. The outer of the two\r\nlayers is called the iris pigment (Fig. 265, _e_, _iris tapetum_), and\r\nthe inner (_f_) the retinal pigment.\r\n\r\nBetween the ommatidia internally there occur, according to Hickson,\r\npigment cells (Fig. 264, _p.g_{3}_), each of which stands on the basilar\r\nmembrane and sends a fine process outwards towards the internal process\r\nof the external pigment-cell (_p.g_{2}_). A long, slender tracheal\r\nvesicle also passes in between the retinulæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 265.—Two ommatidia from the eye of _Colymbetes fuscus_, × 160:\r\n    _a_, cornea; _b_, cone; _c_, rhabdom; _d_, basal membrane, with\r\n    nerve filaments below it: _e_, iris pigment; _f_, retina\r\n    pigment.—After Exner, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The basilar membrane.=—This is a thin fenestrate membrane (Fig. 261)\r\nseparating the cones and rods from the optic tract (Fig. 264, _b.m_). It\r\nis perforated for the passage of tracheal diverticula and of the optic\r\nnerve fibrils. It separates the dioptric or instrumental portion of the\r\neye from the percipient portion, _i.e._ the optic tract.\r\n\r\n=The optic tract.=—This is the optic ganglion of earlier writers, and\r\nappears to be the percipient portion of the eye, as opposed to the\r\ndioptric portion. If the reader will examine Figs. 249 and 261, he will\r\nsee that it consists of three distinct ganglionic swellings, _i.e._ the\r\n_opticon_, _epiopticon_, and _periopticon_, whose structure is very\r\ncomplicated. In Musca (Fig. 261) the first ganglionic swelling (opticon)\r\nis separated from the brain by a slight constriction, which Berger\r\nregards as the homologue of the optic nerve of the other arthropods. It\r\nconsists of a very fine granular matrix traversed throughout by a fine\r\nmeshwork of minute fibrillæ, the neurospongium of Hickson. In the young\r\ncockroach (Periplaneta) the optic nerve separating the cerebral ganglion\r\nfrom the opticon is much longer in proportion than it is in the adult\r\nblow-fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 266.—Periopticon and terminal anastomosis of Agrion, showing the\r\n    character of the elements of the periopticon (_p.op_) and the\r\n    structure of the terminal anastomosis (_t.a_). 1. The first layer of\r\n    the terminal anastomosis, consisting of a plexus of fibrils and\r\n    nerve-cells (_n.c_). 2. The second layer, in which the fibrils are\r\n    collected together in bundles. 3. The final optic plexus and\r\n    nerve-cells. 4. The layer in which the optic fibrils are collected\r\n    in bundles to be distributed to the retinulæ (_r_); _b.m_, basal\r\n    membrane.—After Hickson.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second ganglionic swelling (epiopticon, Fig. 261, _c.op_) is\r\nseparated from the opticon by a tract of fine nerve-fibrils, which\r\npartially decussate; at the decussation two or three larger nerve-cells\r\nmay be seen. It also contains a few scattered nerve-cells (_n.c_). The\r\nthird ganglionic swelling (periopticon, _p.op_) is separated from the\r\nothers by a bundle of long optic nerve-fibrils, which cross one another.\r\nIt is composed of a number of cylindrical masses of neurospongium\r\narranged side by side (Fig. 261, _p.op_). Between these elements of the\r\nperiopticon, which do not seem to bear any relation to the number of\r\nommatidia, a single nerve-cell is very frequently seen. The periopticon\r\ndoes not occur in Periplaneta and Nepa (Hickson). The three optic\r\nganglia thus described, together with the cerebral ganglia, are\r\nsurrounded by a sheath of densely packed nerve-cells.\r\n\r\n  Bearing in mind the fact that the retinulæ are the nerve-end cells\r\n  of the fibres passing through the periopticon, it will be well to\r\n  read the following account, by Hickson, of the terminal anastomosis\r\n  of the optic fibrils in the periopticon of _Agrion bifurcatum_, and\r\n  to examine his sketch (Fig. 266):\r\n\r\n  “The terminal anastomosis of Agrion may be conveniently divided into\r\n  four regions. First the region (1) lying nearest to the periopticon\r\n  in which the nerve-cells are numerous, and the fibrils leaving the\r\n  periopticon form a complicated plexus; the region (2) next to this,\r\n  in which the fibrils have collected into bundles separated by spaces\r\n  occupied by very thin-walled tracheæ in which there are no spiral\r\n  markings, and lymph-spaces; next, the region (3) in which the\r\n  fibrils form a final plexus, and in which there are again a\r\n  considerable number of nerve-cells; and, lastly, the region (4) in\r\n  which the fibrils are again collected into bundles, separated by\r\n  spaces containing tracheæ, which perforate the basement membrane to\r\n  supply the retinulæ.”\r\n\r\n  It would seem as if the decussation of the optic nerve-fibrils were\r\n  a matter of primary importance, as it so generally occurs, but in\r\n  the young of that most generalized of all pterygote insects, the\r\n  cockroach (Periplaneta), Hickson states that the optic nerve-fibrils\r\n  which leave the periopticon pass without decussating to the\r\n  ommateum, and in the adult there is only a partial decussation. In\r\n  Nepa there is no decussation, but the anastomosis is complicated by\r\n  the presence of looped and transverse anastomoses.\r\n\r\nLooking at the eye as a whole, Hickson regards all the nerve structure\r\nof the eye lying between the crystalline cone-layer and the true optic\r\nnerve to be analogous with the retina of other animals. With Ciaccio,\r\nBerger, and others, he does not regard the layer composed of the\r\nretinulæ and rhabdoms as the equivalent of the retina of vertebrates,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Origin of the facetted eye.=—The two kinds of eye, the simple and the\r\ncompound, are supposed to have been derived from a primitive type,\r\nresembling the single eye (ommatidium) of the acone eye of Tipula. As\r\nstated by Lang, “an increase of the elements of this primitive eye led\r\nto the formation of the ocellus; an increase in number of the primitive\r\neyes, and their approximation, led to the formation of the compound\r\nfacet eye.” This view is suggested, he says, by the groups of closely\r\ncontiguous single eyes of the myriopods, considered in connection with\r\nthe compound eye of Scutigera. Grenacher looks upon simple (ocelli) and\r\ncompound eyes as “sisters,” not derived from one another, but from a\r\ncommon parentage.\r\n\r\n  Immature insects rarely possess compound eyes; they are only known\r\n  to occur in the nymphs of Odonata and Ephemeridæ, and in the larvæ\r\n  and pupa of Corethra.\r\n\r\n=Mode of vision by single eyes or ocelli.=—In their simplest condition,\r\nthe eyes of worms and other of the lower invertebrates, probably only\r\nenable those animals to distinguish light from darkness. The ocelli of\r\nspiders and of many insects, however, probably enable them, as Lubbock\r\nremarks, to see as our eyes do. The simple lens throws on the retina an\r\nimage, which is perceived by the fine terminations of the optic nerve.\r\nThe ocelli of different arthropods differ, however, very much in degree\r\nof complexity.\r\n\r\nMüller considered that the power of vision of ocelli “is probably\r\nconfined to the perception of very near objects.”\r\n\r\n  “This may be inferred,” Müller states, “partly from their existing\r\n  principally in larvæ and apterous insects, and partly from several\r\n  observations which I have made relative to the position of these\r\n  simple eyes. In the genus Empusa the head is so prolonged over the\r\n  middle inferior eye that, in the locomotion of the animal, the\r\n  nearest objects can only come within the range. In _Locusta\r\n  cornuta_, also, the same eye lies beneath the prolongation of the\r\n  head.... In the Orthoptera generally, also, the simple eyes are, in\r\n  consequence of the depressed position of the head, directed\r\n  downwards towards the surface upon which the insects are\r\n  moving.”[46] Lowne considers that in the ocellus of Eristalis, the\r\n  great convexity of the lens must give it a very short focus, and the\r\n  comparatively small number of rods render the picture of even very\r\n  near objects quite imperfect and practically useless for purposes of\r\n  vision, and that the function of the ocelli is “the perception of\r\n  the intensity and the direction of light, rather than of vision, in\r\n  the ordinary acceptation of the term.”\r\n\r\n  Réaumur, Marcel de Serres, Dugès, and Forel have shown by\r\n  experiment, that in insects which possess both ocelli and compound\r\n  eyes, the former may be covered over without materially affecting\r\n  the movements of the animals, while if the facetted eyes are\r\n  covered, they act as if in the dark (Lubbock).\r\n\r\n  While Plateau regards the ocelli as of scarcely any use to the\r\n  insect, and Forel claims that wasps, humble bees, ants, etc., walk\r\n  or fly almost equally well without as with the aid of their ocelli,\r\n  Lubbock demurs to this view, and says the same experiments of\r\n  Forel’s might almost be quoted to prove the same with reference to\r\n  the compound eyes. Indeed, the writer has observed that in caves,\r\n  eyeless beetles apparently run about as freely and with as much\r\n  purpose, as their eyed relatives in the open air.\r\n\r\n  Plateau has recently shown that caterpillars which have ocelli alone\r\n  are very short-sighted, not seeing objects at a distance beyond one\r\n  or two centimetres, and it has been fully proved by Plateau and\r\n  others, that spiders, with their well-formed ocelli, are myopic, and\r\n  have little power of making out distinctly the shape of the objects\r\n  they see.\r\n\r\n  On the whole, we are rather inclined to agree with Lubbock and\r\n  Forel, that the ocelli are useful in dark places and for near\r\n  vision. They are, as Lubbock states, especially developed in\r\n  insects, such as ants, bees, and wasps, which live partly in the\r\n  open light and partly in the dark recesses of nests. Moreover, the\r\n  night-flying moths nearly all possess ocelli, while with one known\r\n  exception (Pamphila) they are wanting in butterflies.\r\n\r\n  Finally, remarks Lubbock, “Whatever the special function of ocelli\r\n  may be, it seems clear that they must see in the same manner as our\r\n  eyes do—that is to say, the image must be reversed. On the other\r\n  hand, in the case of compound eyes, it seems probable that the\r\n  vision is direct, and the difficulty of accounting for the existence\r\n  in the same animal of two such different kinds of eyes is certainly\r\n  enhanced by the fact that, as it would seem, the image given by the\r\n  medial eyes is reversed, while that of the lateral ones is direct”\r\n  (p. 181).\r\n\r\n=Mode of vision by facetted eyes.=—The complexity of the facetted eyes\r\nof insects is amazing, and difficult to account for unless we accept the\r\nmosaic theory of Müller, who maintained that the distinctness of the\r\nimage formed by such an eye will be greater in proportion to the number\r\nof separate cones. His famous theory is thus stated: “An image formed by\r\nseveral thousand separate points, of which each corresponds to a\r\ndistinct field of vision in the external world, will resemble a piece of\r\nmosaic work, and a better idea cannot be conceived of the image of\r\nexternal objects which will be depicted on the retina of beings endowed\r\nwith such organs of vision, than by comparing it with perfect work of\r\nthat kind.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 267.—From Lubbock.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHow vision is effected by a many-facetted eye is thus explained by\r\nLubbock: “Let a number of transparent tubes, or cones with opaque walls,\r\nbe ranged side by side in front of the retina, and separated from one\r\nanother by black pigment. In this case the only light which can reach\r\nthe optic nerve will be that which falls on any given tube in the\r\ndirection of its axis.” For instance, in Fig. 267, the light from _a_\r\nwill pass to _a′_, that from _b_ to _b′_, that from _c_ to _c′_, and so\r\non. The light from _c_, which falls on the other tubes, will not reach\r\nthe nerve, but will impinge on the sides and be absorbed by the pigment.\r\nThus, though the light from _c_ will illuminate the whole surface of the\r\neye, it will only affect the nerve at _c′_.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view those rays of light only which pass directly\r\nthrough the crystalline cones, or are reflected from their sides, can\r\nreach the corresponding nerve-fibres. The others fall on, and are\r\nabsorbed by, the pigment which separates the different facets. Hence\r\neach cone receives light only from a very small portion of the field of\r\nvision, and the rays so received are collected into one spot of light.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this theory that the larger and more convex the eye, the\r\nwider will be its field of vision, while the smaller and more numerous\r\nare the facets, the more distinct will be the vision (Lubbock).\r\n\r\nThe theory is certainly supported by the shape and size and the immense\r\nnumber of facets of the eye of the dragon-fly, which all concede to see\r\nbetter, and at a longer range, than probably any other insect.\r\n\r\n  Müller’s mosaic theory was generally received, until doubted and\r\n  criticised by Gottsche (1852), Dor (1861), Plateau, and others. As\r\n  Lubbock in his excellent summary states, Gottsche’s observation\r\n  (previously made by Leeuwenhoek) that each separate cornea gives a\r\n  separate and distinct image, was made on the eye of the blow-fly,\r\n  which does not possess a true crystalline cone. Plateau’s objection\r\n  loses its force, since he seems to have had in his mind, as Lubbock\r\n  states, Gottsche’s, rather than Müller’s, theory.\r\n\r\n  Müller’s theory is supported by Boll, Grenacher, Lubbock, Watase,\r\n  and especially by Exner, who has given much attention to the subject\r\n  of the vision of insects, and is the weightiest authority on the\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\n  Gottsche’s view that each of the facetted eyes makes a distinct\r\n  image which partially overlaps and is combined with all the images\r\n  made by the other facets, was shown by Grenacher to be untenable,\r\n  after repeating Gottsche’s experiments with the eyes of moths, in\r\n  which the crystalline cones are firm and attached to the cornea. He\r\n  was thus able to remove the soft parts, and to look through the\r\n  cones and the cornea. When the microscope was focussed at the inner\r\n  end of the cone, a spot of light was visible, but no image. As the\r\n  object-glass was moved forward, the image gradually came into view,\r\n  and then disappeared again. Here, then, the image is formed in the\r\n  interior of the cone itself.\r\n\r\n  Exner attempted to make this experiment with the eye of Hydrophilus,\r\n  but in that insect the crystalline cones always came away from the\r\n  cornea. “He, however, calculated the focal length, refraction, etc.,\r\n  of the cornea, and concluded that, even if, in spite of the\r\n  crystalline cone, an image could be formed, it would fall much\r\n  behind the retinula.”\r\n\r\n  “In these cases, then,” adds Lubbock, “an image is out of the\r\n  question. Moreover, as the cone tapers to a point, there would, in\r\n  fact, be no room for an image, which must be received on an\r\n  appropriate surface. In many insect eyes, indeed, as in those of the\r\n  cockchafer, the crystalline cone is drawn out into a thread, which\r\n  expands again before reaching the retinula. Such an arrangement\r\n  seems fatal to any idea of an image.”\r\n\r\n  Lubbock thus sums up the reasons which seem to favor Müller’s theory\r\n  of mosaic vision, and to oppose Gottsche’s view: “(1) In certain\r\n  cases, as in Hyperia, there are no lenses, and consequently there\r\n  can be no image; (2) the image would generally be destroyed by the\r\n  crystalline cone; (3) in some cases it would seem that the image\r\n  would be formed completely behind the eye, while in others, again,\r\n  it would be too near the cornea; (4) a pointed retina seems\r\n  incompatible with a clear image; (5) any true projection of an image\r\n  would in certain species be precluded by the presence of\r\n  impenetrable pigment, which only leaves a minute central passage for\r\n  the light-rays; (6) even the clearest image would be useless, from\r\n  the absence of a suitable receptive surface, since both the small\r\n  number and mode of combination of the elements composing that\r\n  surface seem to preclude it from receiving more than a single\r\n  impression; (7) no system of accommodation has yet been discovered;\r\n  finally (8), a combination of many thousand relatively complete eyes\r\n  seems quite useless and incomprehensible.”\r\n\r\n  In his most recent work (1890) on the eyes of crustacea and insects,\r\n  Exner states that the numerous simple eyes which make up the\r\n  compound eye have each a cornea, but it is more or less flat, and\r\n  the crystalline part of the eye has not the shape of a lens, but of\r\n  a “lens cylinder,” that is, of a cylinder which is composed of\r\n  sheets of transparent tissue, the refracting powers of which\r\n  decrease toward the periphery of the cylinder. If an eye of this\r\n  kind is removed and freed of the pigment which surrounds it, objects\r\n  may be looked at through it from behind; but its field of vision is\r\n  very small, and the direct images received from each separate eye\r\n  are either produced close to one another on the retina (or rather\r\n  the retinulæ of all the eyes) or superposed. In this last case no\r\n  less than thirty separate images may be superposed, which is\r\n  supposed to be of great use to night-flying insects. Exner claims\r\n  that many other advantages result from the compound nature of an\r\n  insect’s eye. Thus the mobile pigment, which corresponds to our\r\n  iris, can take different positions, either between the separate eyes\r\n  or behind the lens cylinders, in which case it acts as so many\r\n  screens to intercept the over-abundance of light. Exner finds that\r\n  with its compound eyes the common glow-worm (Lampyris) is capable of\r\n  distinguishing large signboard letters at a distance of ten or more\r\n  feet, as well as extremely fine lines engraved one-hundredth of an\r\n  inch apart, if they are at a distance of less than half an inch from\r\n  the eye. Exner substantiates the truth of the results of Plateau’s\r\n  experiments, and claims that while the compound eye is inferior to\r\n  the vertebrate eye for making out the forms of objects, it is\r\n  superior to the latter in distinguishing the smallest movements of\r\n  objects in the total field of vision.\r\n\r\n  More recently Mallock has given some optical reasons to show that\r\n  Müller’s view is the true one. He concludes, and thus agrees with\r\n  Plateau, that insects do not see well, at any rate as regards their\r\n  power of defining distant objects, and their behavior certainly\r\n  favors this view. It might be asked, What advantage, then, have\r\n  insects with compound eyes over those with simple eyes? Mallock\r\n  answers, that the advantage over simple-eyed animals lies in the\r\n  fact that there is hardly any practical limit to the nearness of the\r\n  objects they can examine. “With the composite eye, indeed, the\r\n  closer the object the better the sight, for the greater will be the\r\n  number of lenses employed to produce the impression; whereas, in the\r\n  simple eye the focal length of the lens limits the distance at which\r\n  a distinct view can be obtained.” He gives a table containing\r\n  measures of the diameters and angles between the axes of the lenses\r\n  of various insect eyes, and states that the best of the eyes would\r\n  give a picture about as good as if executed in rather coarse\r\n  woodwork and viewed at a distance of a foot, “and although a distant\r\n  landscape could only be indifferently represented on such a\r\n  coarse-grained structure, it would do very well for things near\r\n  enough to occupy a considerable part of the field of view.”\r\n\r\n=The principal use of the facetted eye to perceive the movements of\r\nanimals.=—Plateau adopts Exner’s views as to the use of the facetted eye\r\nin perceiving the movements of other animals. He therefore concludes\r\nthat insects and other arthropods with compound eyes do not distinguish\r\nthe form of objects; but with Exner he believes that their vision\r\nconsists mainly in the perception of moving bodies.\r\n\r\n  Most animals seem but little impressed by the form of their enemies\r\n  or of their victims, though their attention is immediately excited\r\n  by the slightest displacement. Hunters, fishermen, and entomologists\r\n  have made in confirmation of this view numerous and demonstrative\r\n  observations.\r\n\r\n  Though the production of an image in the facetted eye of the insect\r\n  seems impossible, we can easily conceive, says Plateau, how it can\r\n  ascertain the existence of a movement. Indeed, if a luminous object\r\n  is placed before a compound eye, it will illuminate a whole group of\r\n  simple eyes or facets; moreover, the centre of this group will be\r\n  clearer than the rest. Every movement of the luminous body will\r\n  displace the centre of clearness; some of the facets not illuminated\r\n  will first receive the light, and others will reënter into the\r\n  shade; some nervous terminations will be excited anew, while those\r\n  which were so formerly will cease to be. Hence the facetted eyes are\r\n  not complete visual organs, but mainly organs of orientation.\r\n\r\n  Plateau experimented in the following way: In a darkened room, with\r\n  two differently shaped but nearly equal light-openings, one square\r\n  and open, the other subdivided into a number of small holes, and\r\n  therefore of more difficult egress, he observed the choices of\r\n  opening made by insects flying from the other end of the room.\r\n  Careful practical provisions were made to eliminate error; the\r\n  light-intensity of the two openings was as far as possible equalized\r\n  or else noted, and no trees or other external objects were in view.\r\n  The room was not darkened beyond the limit at which ordinary type\r\n  ceases to be readable, otherwise the insects refused to fly (it is\r\n  well known that during the passage of a thick cloud insects usually\r\n  cease to fly). These observations were made on insects both with or\r\n  without ocelli, in addition to the compound eyes, and with the same\r\n  results.\r\n\r\n  From repeated experiments on flies, bees, etc., butterflies and\r\n  moths, dragon-flies and beetles, Plateau concludes that insects with\r\n  compound eyes do not notice differences in form of openings in a\r\n  half-darkened room, but fly with equal readiness to the apparently\r\n  easy and apparently difficult way of escape; that they are attracted\r\n  to the more intensely lighted opening, or to one with apparently\r\n  greater surface; hence he concludes that they cannot distinguish the\r\n  form of objects, at least only to a very slight extent, though they\r\n  readily perceive objects in motion.\r\n\r\n  One result of his experiments is that insects only utilize their\r\n  eyes to choose between a _white_ luminous orifice in a dark chamber,\r\n  or another orifice, or group of orifices, _equally white_. They are\r\n  guided neither by odorous emanations nor by differences of color. He\r\n  thinks that bees have as bad sight and act almost exactly as flies.\r\n\r\n  From numerous experiments on Odonata, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera,\r\n  Diptera, and Hymenoptera Plateau arrives provisionally at the\r\n  following conclusions:\r\n\r\n  1. Diurnal insects have need of a quick strong light, and cannot\r\n  direct their movements in partial obscurity.\r\n\r\n  2. Insects with compound eyes do not notice differences of form\r\n  existing between two light orifices, and are deceived by an excess\r\n  of luminous intensity as well as by the apparent excess of surface.\r\n  In short, they do not distinguish the form of objects, or if they\r\n  do, distinguish them very badly.\r\n\r\n  Lubbock, however, does not fully accept Plateau’s experiments with\r\n  the windows, and thinks they discern the form of bodies better than\r\n  Plateau supposes.\r\n\r\n  =How far can insects see?=—It is now supposed that no insects can\r\n  perceive objects at a greater distance than about six feet. On an\r\n  average Lepidoptera can see the movements of rather large bodies\r\n  1.50 meters, but Hymenoptera only 58 cm., and Diptera 68 cm.; while\r\n  the firefly (Lampyris) can see tolerably well the form of large\r\n  objects at a distance of over two meters.\r\n\r\n  Until further experiments are made, it seems probable, then, that\r\n  few if any insects have acute sight, that they see objects best when\r\n  moving, and on the whole—except dragon-flies and other predaceous,\r\n  swiftly flying insects, such as certain flies, wasps, and bees,\r\n  which have very large rounded eyes—insects are guided mainly rather\r\n  by the sense of smell than of sight.\r\n\r\n  =Relation of sight to the color of eyes.=—It appears from the\r\n  observations of Girschner that those Diptera with eyes of a uniform\r\n  color see better than those with brightly banded or spotted eyes.\r\n  Thus those flies (Asilidæ, Empidæ, Leptidæ, Dolichopidæ) whose\r\n  predaceous habits requires good or quick sight have uniformly dark\r\n  eyes, as have also such flies as live constantly on the wing,\r\n  _i.e._, the holoptic Bombyliidæ, Syrphidæ, Pipunculidæ, etc., whose\r\n  eyes are also very large.\r\n\r\n  Those flies whose larvæ are parasitic on other animals have eyes of\r\n  a uniform color that they may readily detect the most suitable host\r\n  for their young; such are the Bombyliidæ, Conopidæ, Pipunculidæ, and\r\n  Tachinidæ.\r\n\r\n  Certain flies which live in the clear sunlight, as many Dolichopidæ,\r\n  some Bombyliidæ, and certain Tabanidæ (Tabanus, Chrysops,\r\n  Hæmatopota), and which are often easily caught with the hand, have\r\n  eyes spotted or banded with bright or metallic colors. This is also\r\n  a sexual trait, as the males of some horse-flies visiting flowers\r\n  have eyes of a single color, the spots and bands surviving only on\r\n  the lower and hinder parts of the eye, while their voracious\r\n  blood-sucking females have the entire eye spotted or banded (Kolbe).\r\n\r\n  =The color-sense of insects.=—Insects, as Spengel first suggested,\r\n  appear to be able to distinguish the color of objects. Lubbock has\r\n  experimentally proved that bees, wasps, and ants have this power,\r\n  blue being the favorite color of the honey-bee, and violet of ants,\r\n  which are sensitive to ultra-violet rays.\r\n\r\n  It is well known that butterflies will descend from a position high\r\n  in the air, mistaking white bits of paper for white flowers; while,\r\n  as we have observed, white butterflies (Pieris) prefer white\r\n  flowers, and yellow butterflies (Colias) appear to alight on yellow\r\n  flowers in preference to white ones.\r\n\r\n  The late Mr. S. L. Elliott once informed us that on a red barn with\r\n  white trimmings he observed that white moths (Spilosoma, Hyphantria,\r\n  and _Acronycta oblinita_) rested on the white parts, while on the\r\n  darker, reddish portions sat Catocalæ and other dark or reddish\r\n  moths. Gross observed that house-flies would frequent a bluish green\r\n  ring on the ceiling of his chamber; but if it were covered by white\r\n  paper, the flies would leave the spot, though they would return as\r\n  soon as the paper ring was removed (Kolbe). We have observed that\r\n  house-flies prefer green paper to the yellowish wall of a kitchen,\r\n  but were not attracted to sheets of a Prussian blue paper, attached\r\n  to the same wall and ceiling.\r\n\r\n  It is generally supposed that the shape and high colors of flowers\r\n  attract insects; but Plateau has made a number of ingenious\r\n  experiments which tend to disprove this view. He used in his\r\n  investigations the dahlia, with its central head of flowerets, which\r\n  contrast so strongly with the corolla. He finds (1) that insects\r\n  frequent flowers which have not undergone any mutilation, but whose\r\n  form and colors are hidden by green leaves. (2) Neither the shape\r\n  nor lively colors of the central head (capitulum) seem to attract\r\n  them. (3) The gayly colored peripheral flowerets of simple dahlias\r\n  and, consequently, of the heads of other composite flowers, do not\r\n  play the rôle of signals, such as has been attributed to them. (4)\r\n  The insects are evidently guided by another sense than that of\r\n  sight, and this sense is probably that of smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE EYES AND VISION\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _a_.

The organs of smell\r\n\r\nThe seat of the organs of smell is mainly in the antennæ, and they may\r\nbe regarded as the principal olfactory organs. For our present knowledge\r\nof the anatomy and physiology of the olfactory organs of insects we are\r\nmainly indebted to the recent investigations of Hauser and of Kraepelin.\r\nThe following historical and critical remarks are translated from\r\nKraepelin’s able treatise:\r\n\r\n  =Historical sketch of our knowledge of the organs of smell.=—In the\r\n  first half of the last century began the inquiries as to the seat of\r\n  the sense of smell in the arthropods. Thus Réaumur, in his Mémoires\r\n  (i, p. 283; ii, 224), expressed the view that in the antennæ was\r\n  situated a special organ which might be an organ of smell.\r\n\r\n  Lesser, Roesel, Lyonet, Bonnet, and others expressed the same\r\n  opinion. Before this Sulzer suggested that an “unknown sense” might\r\n  exist in the antennæ; others regarded the stigmata as organs of\r\n  smell, as these were considered the natural passages for the\r\n  olfactory currents. Duméril, in two special treatises as well as in\r\n  his Considérations générales, sought to prove the theory as to the\r\n  seat of the organs of smell in the stigmata.\r\n\r\n  Against both of these leading views as to the seat of the sense of\r\n  smell were expressed, in the last century, different opinions. Thus\r\n  Comparetti thought that the sense of smell might be localized in\r\n  very different points of the head, in the antennal club of\r\n  lamellicorns, in the sucking-tube of Lepidoptera, in special frontal\r\n  holes of flies and Orthoptera, etc., while Bonsdorf considered the\r\n  palpi as organs of smell.\r\n\r\n  Thus four different views, confused, were held at the opening of\r\n  this century; the Hamburg zoölogist, M. C. S. Lehrman, in three\r\n  different treatises, brought together all the hitherto known\r\n  observations and arguments, treated them critically, and completed\r\n  them by his own extended studies. Lehrman adopted the opinions of\r\n  Reimarus, Baster, Duméril, and Schelver, that the stigmata presented\r\n  the most convenient place for the site of the organs of smell.\r\n  Cuvier followed throughout the lead of Lehrman, but Latreille\r\n  returned to the view of the perception of smell by the antennæ,\r\n  while Treviranus considered the mouth of arthropods as the probable\r\n  site of the sense of smell, an opinion which, before his time,\r\n  Huber, in his experiments on bees, had thought to be correct. Marcel\r\n  de Serres (1811) returned again to the palpi, and asserted—at least\r\n  in the Orthoptera—their functions to be olfactory, while Blainville,\r\n  ten years later, again expressed anew the old opinion that the\r\n  antennæ, or at least their terminations, were organs of smell. Up to\r\n  that date there was an uncertainty as to the seat of the organs both\r\n  of smell and hearing. Fabricius, indeed, had already, in 1783,\r\n  thought he had found an organ of hearing at the base of the outer\r\n  antenna. In 1826 J. Müller mentioned an already well-known organ in\r\n  the abdomen of crickets as an organ of hearing. Müller, however, was\r\n  doubtful, from the fact that the nerve passing to this organ arose,\r\n  not from the brain, but from the third thoracic ganglion; but,\r\n  notwithstanding, he remarks: “Perhaps we have not found the organ of\r\n  hearing in insects because we sought for it in the head.” This\r\n  discovery was afterwards considerably broadened and extended by\r\n  Siebold’s work, for the views of these naturalists on the seat of\r\n  both organs had a definite influence, especially in Germany. For\r\n  awhile, indeed, Müller’s hypothesis stood in complete contradiction,\r\n  so that during the following decennial was presented anew the\r\n  picture of opposing observations and opinions as to the nature of\r\n  the organs of smell. While Robineau-Desvoidy, at the end of the\r\n  twentieth year, and also later, in different writings, strove\r\n  energetically for the olfactory nature of the antennæ,\r\n  Straus-Dürckheim held fast to the view that the tracheæ possessed\r\n  the function under discussion. At the same period Kirby and Spence,\r\n  in their valuable Introduction to Entomology, maintained that “two\r\n  white cushions on the under side of the upper lip” in the mouth of\r\n  biting insects formed a nose or “rhinarium” peculiar to insects.\r\n  This opinion was afterwards adopted by Lacordaire (Introduction à\r\n  Entomologie), and also by Oken in his Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie,\r\n  while Burmeister, rejecting all the views previously held, believed\r\n  that insects might perhaps smell “with the inner upper surface of\r\n  the skin.” Müller’s locust’s ear he regarded as a vocal organ.\r\n\r\n  Besides these occasional expressions of opinion, the French\r\n  literature of the thirtieth and fortieth years of this century\r\n  recorded a long series of special works, with weighty experimental\r\n  and physiological contents, on this subject. Thus Lefebre, in 1838,\r\n  described the experiments which he made on bees, and which seemed to\r\n  assign the seat of the sense of smell to the antennæ. Dugès reported\r\n  similar researches on the Scolopendræ, and Pierret thought that the\r\n  great development of the antennæ in the male Bombycidæ might be\r\n  similarly interpreted. Driesch sought to give currency to the views\r\n  of Bonsdorf, Lamarck, and Marcel de Serres, that the sense of smell\r\n  was localized in the palpi, though Duponchel went back to the old\r\n  assertion of æroscepsis of Lehrman, _i.e._ of the air-test through\r\n  the antennæ, and Goureau again referred the seat of the sense of\r\n  smell to the mouth. In England, Newport at this period put forth a\r\n  work in which he considered the antennæ as organs of touch and\r\n  hearing, and the palpi as organs of smell—a view which, as regards\r\n  the antennæ, was opposed by Newman.\r\n\r\n  Thus the contention as to the use of the antennæ and the seat of the\r\n  organs of smell and hearing fluctuated from one side to the other,\r\n  and when in 1844 Küster, by reason of his experiments on numerous\r\n  insects, again claimed that “the antennæ are the smelling organs of\r\n  insects,” he argued on a scientific basis; yet v. Siebold and\r\n  Stannius (1848), in their valuable Lehrbuch der vergleichenden\r\n  Anatomie (p. 581), remarked that “organs of smell have not yet with\r\n  certainty been discovered in these animals.”\r\n\r\n  The following decennial was of marked importance in the judgment of\r\n  many disputed questions. Almost contemporaneously with Siebold and\r\n  Stannius’ Lehrbuch appeared an opportune treatise by Erichson, in\r\n  which this naturalist first brought forward certain anatomical data\r\n  as to the structure of the antennæ of insects. In a great number of\r\n  insects Erichson described on the upper surface of the antennæ\r\n  peculiar minute pits, “pori,” which, according to him, were covered\r\n  by a thin membrane, and to which he ascribed the perception of\r\n  smell. A still more thorough work on this subject was published in\r\n  the following year by Burmeister, who recognized in the pits of\r\n  lamellicorns many small tubercles and hairs; and about the same time\r\n  Slater, as also Pierret and Erichson before him had done, out of the\r\n  differences of the antennal development in the males and females in\r\n  flesh and plant-eating insects, brought together the proof of the\r\n  olfactory function of the antennæ. But the most valuable work of\r\n  this period is that of Perris, who, after a review of previous\r\n  opinions, by exact observations and experiments, a model of their\r\n  kind, sought to discover the seat of the sense of smell. He comes to\r\n  the conclusion that the antennæ, and perhaps also the palpi, may\r\n  claim this sense, and finds full confirmation of Dufour’s views, and\r\n  adopts as new the physiological possibility expressed by Hill and\r\n  Bonnet, that the antennæ might be the seat of both senses—those of\r\n  smell and hearing.\r\n\r\n  The beautiful works of Erichson, Burmeister, and Perris could not\r\n  remain long unnoticed. In 1857 Hicks published complete researches\r\n  on the peculiar nerve-endings which he had found in the antennæ,\r\n  also in the halteres of flies and the wings of all the other groups\r\n  of insects, and which he judged to be for the perception of smell.\r\n  But Erichson’s and Burmeister’s “pori” were by Lespès, in 1858,\r\n  explained to be so many auditory vesicles with otoliths. This view\r\n  was refuted by Claparède and Claus without their deciding on any\r\n  definite sense. Leydig first made a decided step in advance. In\r\n  different writings this naturalist had busied himself with the\r\n  integumental structures of arthropods, and declared Erichson’s view\r\n  as to the olfactory nature of the antennal pits as the truest,\r\n  before he, in his careful work on the olfactory and auditory organs\r\n  of crabs and insects, had given excellent representations of the\r\n  numerous anatomical details which he had selected from his extensive\r\n  researches in all groups of arthropods. Besides the pits which were\r\n  found to exist in Crustacea, Scolopendræ, beetles, Hymenoptera,\r\n  Diptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera, and Hemiptera, and which had only\r\n  thus far been regarded as sense-organs, Leydig first calls attention\r\n  to the widely distributed pegs and teeth, also considering them as\r\n  sense-organs. “Olfactory teeth,” occurring as pale rods, perforated\r\n  at the end, on the surface of the antennæ of Crustacea, Myriopoda,\r\n  Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, are easily distinguished, and\r\n  besides the “olfactory pegs” of the palpi, may be claimed as organs\r\n  of smell. The nerve-end apparatus first discovered by Hicks in the\r\n  halteres and wings, Leydig thinks should be ranked as organs of\r\n  hearing.\r\n\r\n  There was still some opposition to Leydig’s opinion that in the\r\n  insects the sense of smell is localized in the antennæ (teeth and\r\n  pits), and here the work of Hensen might be mentioned, which in 1860\r\n  had a decided influence upon the conclusion of some inquiries.\r\n\r\n  Thus Landois denied that the antennæ had the sense of smell, and\r\n  declared that the pits in the antennæ of the stag beetle were\r\n  auditory organs. So, also, Paasch rejected Leydig’s conclusion,\r\n  while he sought to again reinstate the old opinion of Rosenthal as\r\n  to the olfactory nature of the frontal cavity of the Diptera. In\r\n  spite of the exact observations and interesting anatomical\r\n  discoveries of Forel in ants, made in 1874, there appeared the great\r\n  work of Wolff on the olfactory organs of bees, in which this\r\n  observer, with much skill and acuteness, sought to give a basis for\r\n  the hypothesis of Kirby and Spence that the seat of the sense of\r\n  smell lay in the soft palatine skin of the labrum within the mouth\r\n  (_i.e._ the epipharynx). Joseph, two years later, drew attention to\r\n  the stigmata as olfactory organs, referring to the olfactory girdle,\r\n  and Forel sought by an occasional criticism of Wolff’s conclusions\r\n  to prove experimentally the olfactory function of the antenna; but\r\n  Graber, in his widely read book on insects, defended the Wolffian\r\n  “nose” in the most determined way, and denied to the antennæ their\r\n  so often indicated faculty of smell. In 1879 Berté thought he had\r\n  observed in the antenna of the flea a distinct auditory organ, and\r\n  Lubbock considered the organs of Forel in the antennæ of ants as a\r\n  “microscopic stethoscope.” In 1879 Graber described a new\r\n  otocyst-like sense-organ in the antennæ of flies, which was\r\n  accompanied by a complete list of all the conceivable forms of\r\n  auditory organs in arthropods. In this work Graber described in\r\n  Musca and other Diptera closed otocysts with otoliths and auditory\r\n  hairs, as Lespès had previously done. But Paul Mayer, in two essays,\r\n  refuted this view in a criticism of the opinion of Berté, referring\r\n  the “otocysts with otoliths” to the well-known antennal pits into\r\n  which tracheæ might pass. Mayer did not decide on the function of\r\n  the hairs which extend to the bottom of the pits; while in the most\r\n  recent research, that of Hauser, the author again energetically\r\n  contended for the olfactory function of the antennæ. Both through\r\n  physiological experiments and detailed anatomical investigations\r\n  Hauser sought to prove his hypothesis, as Pierrot, Erichson, Slater,\r\n  and others had done before him, besides working from an evolutional\r\n  point of view. In a purely anatomical aspect, especially prominent\r\n  are his discovery of the singularly formed nerve-rods in the pits\r\n  and peg-like teeth of the Hymenoptera and their development, as well\r\n  as the assertion that numerous hairs in the pits described by\r\n  Leydig, Meyer, etc., should be considered as direct terminations of\r\n  nervous fibres passing into the pits. In the pits he farther, with\r\n  Erichson, notices a serous fluid, which may serve as a medium for\r\n  the perception of smells. Among the latest articles on this subject\r\n  are those of Künckel and Gazagnaire, which are entirely anatomical,\r\n  while the latest treatise of Graber on the organs of hearing in\r\n  insects opposes Hicks’s theory of the olfactory function of the\r\n  nerve-end apparatus in the halteres, wings, etc., and argues for the\r\n  auditory nature of these structures. Finally, according to Voges,\r\n  the sense of smell is not localized, but spread over the whole body.\r\n\r\n  My own observations on different groups of insects agree, in\r\n  general, with those of Perris, Forel, and Hauser, without being in a\r\n  position to confirm or deny the varying relations of the Hemiptera.\r\n  That irritating odorous substances (chloroform, acetic acid) cause\r\n  the limbs to move in sympathy with the stimulus, I have seen several\r\n  times in Acanthosoma; still it may be a gustatory rather than\r\n  olfactory stimulus.\r\n\r\n  Turning now from speculation and simple observation to exact\r\n  anatomical and histological data, the nerve-end apparatus seems to\r\n  have a distinct reference to the perception of odors. It comprises a\r\n  structure composed of nervous substances which are enclosed in a\r\n  chitinous tube, and either only stand in relation to the surrounding\r\n  bodies by the perforated point, or pass to the surface as free\r\n  nerve-fibrillæ.\r\n\r\n  In insects there is a remarkable and fundamental difference in the\r\n  structures of the parts supposed to be the organs of smell. Erichson\r\n  was acquainted only with the “pori” covered by a thin membrane; but\r\n  Burmeister, in his careful work on the antennæ of the lamellicorns,\r\n  distinguished pits at the bottom of which hairs rise from a cup-like\r\n  tubercle, from those which were free from hairs. Leydig afterwards\r\n  was the first to regard as olfactory organs the so-called pegs\r\n  (_kegel_), a short, thick, hair-like structure distinctly perforated\r\n  at the tip, which had already, by Lespès in Cercopis, etc., been\r\n  described as a kind of tactile papilla. Other very peculiar\r\n  olfactory organs of different form, Forel (Fourmis de la Suisse)\r\n  discovered in the antennæ of ants, which Lubbock incorrectly\r\n  associated with the nerve-end apparatus found by Hicks in other\r\n  insects.\r\n\r\nAs the final result of his researches Kraepelin states that the great\r\nvariety of antennal structures previously described may be referred to a\r\nsingle common fundamental type of a more or less developed free or\r\nsunken hair-like body which stands in connection by means of a wide\r\npore-canal with a many-nucleated ganglion-cell. The latter sends only a\r\nrelatively slender nerve-fibre (axial cord) through the pore-canal into\r\nthe hair; but the same is enclosed by epithelial cells which surround\r\nthe pore-canal.\r\n\r\nHauser’s researches on the organs of smell in insects were so carefully\r\nmade and conclusive that our readers will, we feel sure, be glad to have\r\nlaid before them in detail the facts which prove so satisfactorily that\r\nthe antennæ of most insects are olfactory rather than auditory in their\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n=Physiological experiments.=—First of all one should observe as exactly\r\nas possible the normal animal in its relation to certain odorous\r\nsubstances, whose fumes possess no corrosive power or peculiarities\r\ninterfering with respiration; then remove the antennæ and try after\r\nseveral days to ascertain what changes have taken place in the relation\r\nof the animal to the substance. In order to come to no false results it\r\nis often necessary to let the insects operated upon rest one or two\r\ndays, for immediately after the operation they are generally so restless\r\nthat a careful experiment is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of the antennæ is borne by different insects in\r\ndifferent ways; many bear it very easily, and can live for months after\r\nthe operation, while others die in the course of a few days after the\r\nloss of these appendages. The animals seem to be least injured if the\r\noperation is performed at a time when they are hibernating. _Pyrrhocoris\r\napterus_, and many other insects, afforded a very striking proof of this\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nExperiments made by placing the antennæ in liquid paraffine so as to\r\ncover them with a layer of paraffine, thus excluding the air, gave the\r\nsame result as if the antennæ had been removed.\r\n\r\nThe experiments may be divided, according to their object, into three\r\ngroups. Experiments of the first kind were made on insects in their\r\nrelation to strong-smelling substances, as turpentine, carbolic acid,\r\netc., before and after extirpation of the antennæ. The second group\r\nembraces experiments on the relation of animals as regards their search\r\nfor food; and finally the third group embraces experiments on the\r\nrelation of the sexes relative to reproduction before and after the\r\nextirpation of the antennæ.\r\n\r\n=Relation of insects to smelling substances before and after the loss of\r\ntheir antennæ.=—Taking a glass rod dipped in carbolic acid and holding\r\nit within 10 cm. of _Philonthus œneus_, found under stones at the end of\r\nFebruary, it was seen to raise its head, turn it in different\r\ndirections, and to make lively movements with its antennæ. But scarcely\r\nhad Hauser placed the rod close to it when it started back as if\r\nfrightened, made a sudden turn, and rushed, extremely disturbed, in the\r\nopposite direction. When he removed the glass rod, the creature busied\r\nitself for some time with its antennæ, while it drew them, with the aid\r\nof its fore limbs, through its mouth, although they had not come into\r\ndirect contact with the carbolic acid. There was the same reaction\r\nagainst oil of turpentine, and it was still more violent against acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nAfter having many times carefully tested the relations of the normal\r\nanimal to the substances mentioned, the antennæ were removed from the\r\nsocket-cavity.\r\n\r\nOn the second day after Hauser experimented with the insects, they\r\nexhibited no reaction either against the carbolic acid, the oil of\r\nturpentine, or even against the acetic acid, although he held the glass\r\nrod which had been dipped into it for one or two minutes before and over\r\nthe head. The creatures remained completely quiet and immovable, at the\r\nmost slightly moving the palpi. They showed otherwise no change in their\r\nmode of life and their demeanor; they ate with great eagerness flesh\r\nwhich had been placed before them, or dead insects, and some were as\r\nactive as usual as late as May. These beetles had, as proved by the\r\nexperiments, lost the sense of smell alone; how far the sense of touch\r\nwas lost Hauser could not experimentally decide.\r\n\r\nThe same results followed experiments with species of the genus Ptinus,\r\nTenebrio, Ichneumon, Formica, Vespa, Tenthredo, Saturnia, Vanessa, and\r\nSmerinthus; also many species of Diptera and Orthoptera, besides Julus\r\nand Lithobius, while many larvæ reacted in the same manner.\r\n\r\n  Less satisfactory were the experiments with Carabus, Melolontha, and\r\n  Silpha; there is no doubt that the species of these genera, through\r\n  the extirpation of their antennæ, become more or less injured as to\r\n  the acuteness of their powers of smelling; but they never show\r\n  themselves wholly unable to perceive strong-smelling substances.\r\n\r\n  The allurement of the substance acts for a longer time on those\r\n  deprived of their antennæ, then they become restless, then they\r\n  wander away from the glass tube held before them; still all their\r\n  movements are but slightly energetic, and the entire reaction is\r\n  indeterminate and enfeebled.\r\n\r\n  Experiments with the Hemiptera gave still more unfavorable results;\r\n  after the loss of their antennæ they reacted to smells as eagerly as\r\n  those did which were uninjured.\r\n\r\n=Experiments on the use of the antennæ in seeking for food.=—Under this\r\nhead experiments were made with Silpha, Sarcophaga, Calliphora, and\r\nCynomyia.\r\n\r\nSilpha and its larva were treated in the following manner: they were\r\nplaced in large boxes whose bottoms were covered with moss, etc.; in a\r\ncorner of the box was placed a bottle with a small opening, in which was\r\nplaced strong-smelling meat. So long as the beetles were in possession\r\nof their antennæ they invariably after a while discovered the meat\r\nexposed in the bottle, while after the loss of their antennæ they did\r\nnot come in contact with it.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way acted the species of Sarcophaga, Calliphora, and\r\nCynomyia. Hauser, in experimenting with these, placed a dish with a\r\nlarge piece of decayed flesh on his writing-table. In a short time\r\nspecimens of the flies referred to entered through the open window of\r\nthe room. The oftener he drove them away from the meat would they swarm\r\nthickly upon it. Then closing the window and catching all the flies, he\r\ndeprived them of their antennæ and again set them free. They flew about\r\nthe room, but none settled upon the flesh nor tried to approach it.\r\nWhere a fly had alighted on a curtain or other object, the decayed flesh\r\nwas placed under it so that the full force of the effluvium should pass\r\nover it, but even then no fly would settle upon it.\r\n\r\n=Experiments testing the influence of the antennæ of the males in\r\nseeking the females.=—For this purpose Hauser chose those kinds in which\r\nthe male antennæ differ in secondary sexual characters from those of the\r\nfemale, and in which it is known that they readily couple in\r\nconfinement, as _Saturnia pavonia_, _Ocneria dispar_, and _Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_. The two first-named insects did not couple after the\r\nextirpation of their antennæ. Of _Melolontha vulgaris_ twenty pairs were\r\nplaced in a moderately sized box. On the next morning twelve pairs of\r\nthem were found coupling. Hauser then, after removing the first lot,\r\nplaced a new set of thirty pairs in the same box, cut off all the\r\nantennæ of the males and those of a number of females. On the following\r\nmorning only four pairs were found coupling, and at the end of three\r\ndays five others were observed sexually united.\r\n\r\n  From these experiments Hauser inferred that those insects deprived\r\n  of their antennæ were placed in the most favorable situation, such\r\n  as they would not find in freedom; for the space in which the\r\n  insects moved about was so limited that the males and females must\r\n  of necessity meet. But at the same time the results of the\r\n  experiments cannot absolutely be regarded as proving that the males,\r\n  after the loss of their antennæ, were then not in condition to find\r\n  the females, because in the case of the above-mentioned moths, under\r\n  similar conditions, after the extirpation of the antennæ no sexual\r\n  union took place. If, however, the experiments made do not all lead\r\n  to the results desired, Hauser thinks that the results agree with\r\n  those of his histological researches, that in the greater number of\r\n  insects the sense of smell has its seat in the antennæ. His results\r\n  also agree with those of Perris.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the organs of smell in insects.=—The olfactory organs\r\nconsist, in insects,—_i.e._, all Orthoptera, Termitidæ, Psocidæ,\r\nDiptera, and Hymenoptera, also in most Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, and\r\nColeoptera,—\r\n\r\n1. Of a thick nerve arising from the brain, which passes into the\r\nantennæ.\r\n\r\n2. Of a sensitive apparatus at the end, which consists of staff-like\r\ncells, which are modified hypodermis cells, with which the fibres of the\r\nnerves connect.\r\n\r\n3. Of a supporting and accessory apparatus, consisting of pits, or peg-\r\nor tooth-like projections filled with a serous fluid, and which may be\r\nregarded as invaginations and outgrowths of the epidermis.\r\n\r\nHauser adds a remark on the distribution of the pits and teeth in the\r\nlarvæ of insects, saying that his observations are incomplete, but that\r\nit appears that in the larvæ the teeth are most generally distributed,\r\nand that they occur not on the antennæ alone, but on the palpi; but in\r\nvery many larvæ neither pits nor teeth[47] occurred. In the Myriopoda\r\nteeth-like projections occur on the ends of the antennæ. In Lithobius\r\nthey form very small, almost cylindrical, pale organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 268.—Olfactory organ of Caloptenus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 269.—Olfactory pits of the antenna of Stenobothrus.

On one antennal joint of Caloptenus (Fig.\r\n268) was often counted 50 pits; on the anterior joints the number\r\ndiminishes to about 30. Hauser thinks that in all Orthoptera whose\r\nantennæ are like those of Caloptenus occur similar pits, as he found\r\nthem in Stenobothrus (Fig. 269) as well as in Œdipoda. Gryllotalpa\r\npossesses similar pits,—four to six on each antennal joint, making\r\nbetween 300 and 400 pits on each antenna.[48] In _Mantis religiosa_ the\r\npits were not detected, but on each joint, except the eighth basal,\r\nthere are about 200 small, hollow, curved teeth with a fine opening in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nIn the Neuroptera (Chrysopa) there occur on the antennæ, besides\r\nnumerous very long tactile bristles, small pale, transparent teeth. No\r\npits could be detected.\r\n\r\nIn the Hemiptera (two species of Pyrrhocoris only were examined) only\r\ntwo kinds of tactile bristles occurred, but Hauser detected no pits,\r\nthough Lespès states that they are present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 272.—Longitudinal section of apex of palpus of _Pieris brassicæ_:\r\n    _sch_, scales; _ch_, cuticula; _hyp_, hypodermis; _n_, nerve; _sz_,\r\n    sense-cells; _sh_, sense-hairs.—After Vom Rath, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the Diptera, Hauser examined more than 60 species. The pits in the\r\n_Diptera brachycera_ (Muscidæ, etc.) are unexceptionally confined to the\r\nthird antennal joint. Their number varies extraordinarily in the\r\ndifferent species. _Helophilus florens_ has on each antennal disk only a\r\nsingle pit, while _Echinomyia grossa_ possesses 200 of them. In flies of\r\ncertain families the pits are compound, and contain 10, 20, and often\r\n100 olfactory hairs, partly arising from the coalescence of several\r\npits. Such pits are usually divided by lateral walls into several\r\nchambers, whose connection is only indicated by their common outlet.\r\nSimple olfactory pits with a single olfactory style were observed only\r\nin the Tabanidæ, Asilidæ, Bombylidæ, Leptidæ, Dolichopidæ, Stratiomyidæ,\r\nand Tipulidæ. In the last the compound forms do not occur at all, but in\r\nthe other families mentioned also occur compound pits, receiving from\r\ntwo to ten nerve-terminations.\r\n\r\nThe antennal pits of flies are always sac-like invaginations of the\r\nexternal chitinous integument, of manifold shapes, opening externally\r\nand never closed by a membrane. The pits differ but slightly in the\r\ndifferent species, and that of _Cyrtoneura stabulans_ (Fig. 273) is\r\ndescribed at length as typical of those of brachycerous flies in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory pits of the Tipulidæ seem to have a somewhat different\r\nstructure, since the external passage is closed. It is circular,\r\nsurrounded with a slight chitinous wall, and not covered with bristles.\r\nSuch pits in their external appearance are like those of the locust\r\n(Caloptenus) and many Hymenoptera. They are situated usually on the\r\nthird antennal joint. _Pachyrhina pratensis_ L. has about 60 of them, as\r\nhave _Tipula oleracea_ L. and Ctenophora.\r\n\r\nIn the Lepidoptera, olfactory pits are much like those of flies. Hauser\r\ndescribes in detail those of _Vanessa io_. Those of the moths were not\r\nexamined, but they can be readily and satisfactorily proved to be the\r\nsite of the olfactory sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 273.—Longitudinal section through the third antennal joint of a\r\n    fly (_Cyrtoneura stabulans_), showing the compound pits from above\r\n    and in section.—After Hauser.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 274.—Antenna of Adelops, showing the olfactory organs (_p_) in\r\n    the five last joints.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHistorical researches in respect to the Coleoptera generally gave a very\r\nunfavorable result, contrary to Lespès’s views. That author states that\r\nin the Carabidæ the pits are found on the four first joints, but Hauser\r\ncould discover them in none which he examined. Usually only tactile\r\nbristles occur, so also in the Cerambycidæ, Curculionidæ, Chrysomelidæ,\r\nand Cantharidæ. In a blind silphid beetle (_Adelops hirtus_) of Mammoth\r\nCave we have found well-marked olfactory organs (Fig. 274). Similar\r\norgans occur in the antennæ of the Panorpidæ.\r\n\r\nOlfactory pits, however, without doubt occur in Silpha, Necrophorus,\r\nStaphylinus, Philonthus, and Tenebrio. The openings of the pits are\r\nsmall and surrounded with a small chitinous ring; in Silpha,\r\nNecrophorus, and Tenebrio they cannot easily be distinguished from the\r\ninsertion-cavities of the bristles, but in Philonthus and Staphylinus\r\nthey are less like them, being distinguished by their somewhat larger\r\nsize and their often more oval form. In _Philonthus æneus_ about 100\r\nsuch small pits occur irregularly on the terminal joints; besides, in\r\nthis species on each side of the terminal joint is an apparatus which is\r\nlike the compound pit generally occurring in the Diptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 275.—Olfactory pits of the antenna of _Melolontha\r\n    vulgaris_.—After Kraepelin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 276.—Antennal pit of _Melolontha vulgaris_, seen in vertical\r\n    section.—After Hauser.\r\n]\r\n\r\nVery remarkable pits occur in the antennal lamellæ of _Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_ (Fig. 275) and other lamellicorns. On the outer surface of the\r\nfirst and seventh (in the female the sixth) antennal leaf, as also on\r\nthe edges of the other leaves, only arise scattered bristles; on the\r\ninner surface of the first and seventh leaves, as also on both surfaces\r\nof the second to sixth leaves, are close rows of rather shallow\r\ndepressions of irregular form, some circular, others regularly\r\nhexagonal. Their number is enormous: in the males 39,000, in the females\r\nabout 35,000, occur on each antenna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 277.—Organ of smell of Anophthalmus.—After Hauser. _A_, _a_, _b_,\r\n    the same in _A. tenuis_, _B_ in _A. tellkampfii_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 278.—Section through antennal joint of _Vespa crabro_, showing\r\n    the great number of olfactory pits, olfactory and tactile bristles.\r\n    _A_, section through an olfactory pit of _Vespa crabro_.—After\r\n    Hauser.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe antennal pits and teeth of _Dyticus marginalis_ are morphologically\r\nand physiologically identical with those of bees and wasps. In\r\n_Anophthalmus bilimekii_, Hauser found on the last antennal joints about\r\n60 teeth, which essentially differ in form from those previously\r\ndescribed; they are very pale, transparent, cylindrical, elongated, and\r\nbent elbow-shaped on the first third, so that the last two-thirds run\r\nparallel with the antenna. The length of these remarkable teeth is 0.035\r\nmm., their breadth 0.005 mm. He only found them in Anophthalmus, and in\r\nno other species of Carabidæ; they must resemble the teeth described in\r\nChrysopa. Our species possesses similar processes (Fig. 277). Similar\r\nteeth occur on the maxillary and labial palpi of beetles. _Dyticus\r\nmarginalis_ possesses at the end of each terminal palpal joint a group\r\nof very small teeth, which were also detected in _Anophthalmus\r\nbilimekii_, _Melolontha vulgaris_, etc. In _Carabus violascens_ were\r\ndetected on the maxillary palpi large, plainly microscopical, white\r\ndisks, which are surrounded with a great number of extremely small\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nWhether the above-described organs on the palpi of beetles should be\r\nconsidered as olfactory or gustatory in their nature can only be\r\ndetermined by means of physiological experiments; they probably receive\r\ntaste-nerve terminations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 279.—Olfactory pits of the antenna of _Vespa vulgaris_.—After\r\n    Kraepelin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Hymenoptera furnished very good material for histological purposes,\r\nso that Hauser could not only study the terminal apparatus of the\r\nolfactory nerves in the perfect insect, but also in three different\r\nstages of the pupa. These are described at length, as regards the\r\ndistribution of the pits and teeth, in _Vespa crabro_; each joint of the\r\nantenna (flagellum) possesses between 1300 and 1400 pits, nearly 60\r\nteeth, and about 70 tactile hairs; on the terminal joint there are more\r\nthan 200 teeth, so that each antenna has between 13,000 and 14,000\r\nolfactory pits and about 700 teeth (Kegeln). Fig. 278 represents a\r\ncross-section through the penultimate antennal joint of _Vespa crabro_;\r\nwe can see how thick are the series of openings on the surface of the\r\nantennæ, and how regular is the distribution of the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the olfactory pits and olfactory teeth is thus seen\r\nto be very general; the deviations are so insignificant that there is no\r\nreason for the establishment of more than one type.\r\n\r\nAntennal pits with a small crevice-like opening occur in genera nearly\r\nallied to Vespa and also in most Ichneumonidæ, Braconidæ, and Cynipidæ.\r\nBut the crevice-like openings in these families are considerably longer\r\nand often are of a somewhat twisted shape. In all the species with\r\ntranslucent antennæ we can recognize the inner mouth of the pit as a\r\nround or nearly round disk situated usually under the middle of the\r\nopening. The antennal pits of _Apis mellifica_, as well as those of\r\nBombus (Fig. 280) and allied genera, differ from those of the\r\nIchneumonidæ in being not like crevices, but circular openings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280.—Olfactory pits of the antenna of Bombus.—After Kraepelin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 281.—Olfactory pits of the antenna of Formica: _Fv_, Hicks’\r\n    “bottle,” Forel’s flask-shaped organ, _Fvo_, its opening.—After\r\n    Kraepelin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 282.—Supposed olfactory organs at end of antenna of Campodea:\r\n    _A_, _C. staphylinus_. _B_, _C. cookei_, from Mammoth Cave.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 283.—Vertical section through a single olfactory pit in the\r\n    antenna of the horse-fly (_Tabanus bovinus_). For lettering see p.\r\n    272.—After Hauser.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the olfactory peg or tooth-like projections seems to\r\nbe much more limited than that of the pits in the Ichneumonidæ. Hauser\r\ncould not find any. _Apis mellifica_ possesses on each antennal joint\r\nonly about twenty slender pale teeth, scarcely a third as many as in\r\n_Vespa crabro_; on the other hand, Formica, of which genus several\r\nspecies were examined, seems to have far more teeth than pits; they are\r\nrelatively long, pale, transparent, and somewhat clavate; they are not\r\nunlike those of Chrysopa; on the terminal joint only occur the round\r\nopenings (_Fvo_), which lead into a bottle-shaped invagination of the\r\nintegument (_Fv_) and contain an olfactory style (Fig. 281). In the\r\nTenthredinidæ only teeth and no pits were to be detected. Sirex has on\r\nthe under side of the nine last joints of each antenna a group of from\r\n200 to 300 small teeth, which resemble those of _Vespa crabro_; Lyda has\r\non the terminal joints about 100 teeth. We may add that supposed organs\r\nof smell occur on the antennæ of Campodea (Fig. 282).\r\n\r\nKraepelin also thus briefly summarizes Hauser’s statements as to the\r\nforms of the different organs of smell.\r\n\r\n  The manifold nature of the antennal organs has, by Hauser, from\r\n  thorough studies of the nerve-elements belonging to them, been not\r\n  simplified but rendered more complicated. According to this\r\n  naturalist we may distinguish the following forms which the\r\n  olfactory organs may assume: 1. “Pale, tooth-like chitinous hairs on\r\n  the outer surface of the antennæ, which are perforated at the end;\r\n  nothing is known as to the relation of the nerve passing into it\r\n  (Chrysopa, Anophthalmus). 2. In pit-like depressions of the antennæ\r\n  arise _nerve-rods_ (without a chitinous case) which stand in direct\r\n  relation with a ganglion-cell lying under it. These pits are either\r\n  _simple_, viz. with only an ‘olfactory rod’ (Tabanus, Fig. 283, and\r\n  other Diptera, Vanessa), or _compound_ (Muscidæ, and most other\r\n  Diptera, and Philonthus). It is important that these pits are partly\r\n  _open_ (in the above-named groups of insects), and partly _closed_\r\n  and covered with a thin membrane, under whose concavity the\r\n  olfactory rods end (Orthoptera, Melolontha, and other lamellicorns).\r\n  3. Short, thick pits sunken slightly into the surface of the\r\n  antennæ, and over this a chitinous peg perforated at the end, in\r\n  whose base, from the interior, projects a very singular nerve-peg,\r\n  which is situated over an olfactory ganglion-cell, and provided with\r\n  a slender crown of little rods, and flanked on each side by a\r\n  flagellum-cell (Hymenoptera). 4. Round or crevice-like pits covered\r\n  over by a perforated chitinous membrane with nerve-rods like those\r\n  in 3, but in place of the flagellum-cell with ‘membrane-forming’\r\n  cells spread before it. Hauser finally mentions further differences\r\n  in the ganglion-cells sent out into the nerve-end apparatus. These\r\n  exhibit in Diptera and Melolontha only one nucleus, in Hymenoptera a\r\n  single very large one (with many nucleoli) and three small ones, in\r\n  Vanessa six, in Orthoptera a very large number of nuclei, etc.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE OF THE ORGANS OF SMELL\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Réaumur, Réné Ant. de.= Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire des\r\n    insectes.

The organs of taste\r\n\r\nThe gustatory organs of insects are microscopic pits or setae, either\r\nhair-like or resembling short pegs, which form the ends of ganglionated\r\nnerves. They are difficult to distinguish morphologically from certain\r\nolfactory structures, and it is owing to their position at or very near\r\nthe mouth that they are supposed to be gustatory in nature.\r\n\r\nMeinert was the first (1860) to suggest that organs of taste occurred in\r\nants. He observed in the maxillæ, and tongue of these insects a series\r\nof canals in the cuticula of these organs connected with ganglion-cells,\r\nand through them with the nerves, and queried whether they were not\r\norgans of taste. Forel afterwards (1874) confirmed these observations.\r\nWolff in an elaborate work (1875) described a group of minute pits (Fig.\r\n284) at the base of the tongue of the honey bee, which he supposed to\r\npossess the sense of smell, but Forel and also Lubbock attributed to\r\nthese sensory pits the function of taste. Ten years afterward Will\r\nshowed conclusively, both by anatomical studies and by experiments, that\r\nDiptera and Hymenoptera possess gustatory organs. He, however, denied\r\nthat the organs of Wolff were gustatory, and maintained that organs of\r\nsmell were confined to the maxillæ, paraglossæ, and tongue. As we shall\r\nsee, however, what appear to be with little doubt taste-pits, with hairs\r\nor pegs arising from them, are most numerous on the epipharynx of nearly\r\nall insects, and situated at a point where they necessarily must come in\r\ncontact with the food as it enters the mouth and passes down the throat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 284.—Taste-pits on the epipharynx (_C_) of the honey-bee: _B_,\r\n    horny ridge; _R_, _R_, taste-pits; _L_, _A_, _A_, muscular fibres;\r\n    _S_, _S′_, _a b c d e f_, section of skin of œsophagus.—After Wolff.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 285.—Tip of the proboscis of the honey bee, × 140: _L_, terminal\r\n    button or ladle: _Gs_ taste-hairs; _Sh_, guard-hairs; _Hb_, hooked\r\n    hairs.—After Will.\r\n]\r\n\r\nKraepelin (1883) discovered taste-organs on the proboscis of the fly,\r\nand taste-hairs at the end of the tongue of the humble-bee (Fig. 285),\r\nand afterwards Lubbock critically discussed the subject, and concluded\r\nthat the organs of taste in insects are situated “either in the mouth\r\nitself, or on the organs immediately surrounding it.”\r\n\r\n=Structure of the taste-organs.=—The organs have been best studied by\r\nWill, who, besides describing and figuring the chitinous structures,\r\nsuch as the pits or cups, hairs and the pegs, showed that they were the\r\nterminations of ganglionated nerves.\r\n\r\nFigure 286 represents the taste-cups on the maxilla of a wasp, and Fig.\r\n287 the taste-cone or peg projecting from the cup or pit. The cell out\r\nof which the pit and projecting hair or peg are formed is a modified\r\nhypodermis cell; and the seta is apparently a modification of a tactile\r\nhair, situated at the end of a nerve, which just beneath the chitinous\r\nstructures passes into a ganglion-cell, which sends off a nerve-fibre to\r\nthe main nerve.\r\n\r\nWill detected on the tongue of the yellow ant (_Lasius flavus_) from 20\r\nto 24, and in Atta from 40 to 52, of these structures. The number of\r\npits on the maxillæ vary much, not always being the same on the two\r\nsides of the same insect. We have observed these taste-cups in the honey\r\nand humble bee, not only at the base of the second maxillæ (Fig. 288,\r\n_g_), but also on the paraglossæ (_pg_).\r\n\r\n  =Distribution in other orders of insects.=—The writer has detected\r\n  these taste-cups in other orders than Diptera and Hymenoptera. They\r\n  very generally occur in mandibulate insects on the more exposed\r\n  surface of the epipharynx (compare pp. 43–46). We have not observed\r\n  them in the Synaptera (Lepisma and Machilis).\r\n\r\n  In the Dermaptera the taste-cups appear to be undeveloped in the\r\n  nymph, while in the adult they are fewer in number than in any other\r\n  pterygote order yet investigated.\r\n\r\n  In a species of Forficula from Cordova, Mexico, the taste-pits are\r\n  few in number, there being only about a dozen on each side in all;\r\n  most of them being situated on the anterior half, and a few near the\r\n  base. The taste-pits are provided each with a short fine seta, as\r\n  usual arising from the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 286.—Under side of left maxilla of Vespa: _Gm_, taste-cups;\r\n    _Shm_, protecting hairs; _Tb_, tactile hairs; _Mt_, base of\r\n    maxillary palpus.—After Will.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the order Platyptera (including Perla, Pteronarcys, Psocus,\r\n  Termes, Eutermes, and Termopsis) we have been unable to detect any\r\n  organs of taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 287.—Section through a taste-cup: _SK_, supporting cone; _N_,\r\n    nerve; _SZ_, sense-cell.—After Will.

On\r\n  each side of the middle of the epipharynx is a curved row of stiff,\r\n  defensive spines, and at the distal end of each row is a sensory\r\n  field, containing 20 taste-cups on one side and 23 on the other.\r\n  Near the front edge of the clypeal region are two more sensory\r\n  fields, situated on each side of the median line, there being 35\r\n  taste-cups in each field. The taste-cups in this form are rather\r\n  smaller than usual in the order.\r\n\r\n  In the Acrydiidæ they are more numerous than in the Blattidæ. For\r\n  example, in _Camnula pellucida_, near what corresponds to the front\r\n  edge of the clypeus are two gustatory fields, each bearing about 35\r\n  taste-pits. Just in front, under the clypeo-labral suture, are two\r\n  similar fields, each containing from 40 to 42 taste-pits. There are\r\n  none in front of these. There are thus about 140–150 sense-cups in\r\n  all.\r\n\r\n  The members of the Locustidæ (Fig. 26) appear to be better provided\r\n  with the organs of taste than any other Orthoptera, those of the\r\n  katydid numbering from 170 to 180. There are from 50 to 60\r\n  taste-cups in the front region; behind the middle a group of 25 on\r\n  each side, and over an area corresponding to the base of the labrum\r\n  and front edge of the clypeus is a sensory field with about 70\r\n  taste-cups on each side. They are true cups or beaker-like papillæ,\r\n  some with a fine, others with a short, stout, conical seta.\r\n\r\n  The gustatory organs in the cave cricket (_Hadenœcus subterraneus_,\r\n  Fig. 27), from Mammoth Cave, are highly developed, being rounded\r\n  papillæ with the nucleus at the top or end. They are grouped on each\r\n  side of the middle near the front edge, there being 25 on each side.\r\n  An irregular row of these beaker-like organs extends along each\r\n  side; some occur under the base of the labrum, but they are most\r\n  numerous in a field corresponding to the front edge of the clypeus,\r\n  there being 50 on each side, or 100 in all, where in Ceuthophilus\r\n  there are only 9 or 10. It would thus appear as if the sense of\r\n  taste were much more acute in the cave-dweller than in the\r\n  out-of-doors form.\r\n\r\n  In the Coleoptera taste-cups and setæ are very generally\r\n  distributed, though we were unable to detect them in Dendroctonus or\r\n  in _Lucanus dama_. As seen in Fig. 57, we have observed numerous\r\n  taste-pegs along the maxilla of _Nemognatha lurida_, but otherwise\r\n  taste-organs have only been detected in the epipharynx. They not\r\n  only occur in the adult beetles, but we have found them in the larvæ\r\n  of cerambycid, scarabæid, and other beetles. In the adults\r\n  taste-cups appear to be about as well developed in the carnivorous\r\n  forms (Carabidæ) as in the phytophagous or lignivorous groups.\r\n\r\n  In _Chlænius tomentosus_ there are about half as many of these\r\n  organs as in Harpalus, while in Calosoma there are 90 taste-cups, 45\r\n  on each side, under the base of the labrum. The cups are\r\n  papilliform, being rather high, with a seta arising from each.\r\n\r\n  In the Cicindelidæ, the epipharynx bears a sensory field quite\r\n  different from that of the Carabidæ. There are no normal taste-cups,\r\n  except a few situated on two large, round, raised areas which are\r\n  guarded in front by a few very long setæ. On the surface of each\r\n  area are numerous very long setæ which may, if not tactile, have\r\n  some other sense, as they arise from cup-like bases or cells. Those\r\n  on the outside are like true taste-cups, with a bristle but little\r\n  larger than normal in taste-cups generally. We are disposed to\r\n  regard this sensory field as a highly specialized gustatory\r\n  apparatus.\r\n\r\n  In the Dyticidæ the taste-cups are nearly as described in the\r\n  Carabidæ.\r\n\r\n  The Staphylinidæ are not well provided with taste-organs. Under the\r\n  clypeus of _Staphylinus violaceus_, on each side near the middle, is\r\n  a bare rounded area, in which are situated 4 or 5 papilliform\r\n  taste-cups, and at the base behind them is another linear group of\r\n  about 7 slenderer, somewhat curved, taste-cups. In the Elateridæ\r\n  these organs are scantily developed.\r\n\r\n  In the Buprestidæ (_Buprestis maculiventris_ alone examined) no true\r\n  taste-cups were detected. On the other hand, the Lampyridæ are well\r\n  supplied with them. Under the clypeus is situated a sensory field\r\n  bearing 26 taste-cups, which are rather smaller than usual. Over the\r\n  epipharyngeal surface are scattered a few taste-cups, but they are\r\n  small and perhaps not gustatory. Under the clypeus of _Lucidota\r\n  punctata_ Lec. is a group of 12 taste-cups, and in the middle region\r\n  of the epipharynx, situated in a field extending from near the base\r\n  to near the front edge, are about 40 taste-cups, which, however, are\r\n  not, as is usual, arranged on each side of the median line, but are\r\n  scattered among the hairs of the pilose surface of the epipharynx.\r\n  In the Cleridæ the taste-cups are few in number.\r\n\r\n  In the great family of Scarabæidæ, the presence of gustatory organs\r\n  is variable. None occur in _Lucanus dama_, though in the June beetle\r\n  (_Lachnosterna fusca_ Fröhl.) they are abundantly developed. The\r\n  epipharynx bears on each side outside of a spiny area a group of\r\n  about 50 taste-cups, each bearing a long seta, those on the outside\r\n  of the area passing into a few high, rather slender, papillæ,\r\n  without a seta. On the under side of the clypeus is a median group\r\n  of 10 taste-cups of singular form, the cups being large, with broad\r\n  bases, which posteriorly bear three spines, of which the median one\r\n  is the largest.\r\n\r\n  Taste-cups occur without any known exception in the longicorn\r\n  beetles. In _Leptura canadensis_ they are numerous; in _Euryptera\r\n  lateralis_ they are abundant along and near the middle of the\r\n  anterior half of the labral region, and in _Cyllene robiniæ_ Forst.\r\n  (or _pictus_ Drury) they are more numerous than usual, extending in\r\n  an unbroken sensory field from near the front margin of the clypeal\r\n  region to near the front edge of the epipharynx. The cups vary much\r\n  in size, some being one-half as large as others; and those on the\r\n  sides of the sensory field bear short, and a few others rather long,\r\n  bristles, showing that the taste-cups are modified tactile bristles.\r\n\r\n  The Tenebrionidæ are fairly well endowed with taste-cups, their\r\n  number in _Eleodes obsoleta_ Say amounting to 30 or 40.\r\n\r\n  Those of the Meloidæ especially are unusual in size and number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 289.—Epipharynx (_ep_) of Nemognatha: _cl_, clypeus; _gh_,\r\n    gathering hairs; _tc_, triangular sensory field dotted with taste\r\n    cups; _A_, the field enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In _Nemognatha lurida_ Lec. (Fig. 289) the front edge of the\r\n  epipharynx contains about 80 remarkably small taste-cups, arranged\r\n  irregularly in a triangular sensory space, and not more than ¼ to ⅙,\r\n  as large as those on the maxillæ of the same beetle. Unless the\r\n  former structures are gustatory it is difficult to account for their\r\n  presence here, and it will be observed that the taste-cups in\r\n  Epicauta are unusually abundant. Thus in the middle and near the\r\n  front of the epipharynx of the blister-beetle over 100 gustatory\r\n  cups were counted. They are conical, papilliform, and truncated at\r\n  the end as if open, the edge of the opening being ragged, though\r\n  bearing no bristle, except in a few cases. Around the edge of the\r\n  sinus, on the under side of the labrum, is a regular marginal row of\r\n  large, longer, more distinctly chitinized taste-cups, whose walls\r\n  are streaked up and down by chitinous thickenings. In _E. callosa_\r\n  Lec. there are about 55 taste-cups under the labrum, besides about\r\n  10 cells, which may be gustatory structures, situated on either side\r\n  of a median setose ridge which passes back under the clypeal region.\r\n\r\n  The taste-cups of the leaf-beetles are fairly numerous, judging from\r\n  an examination of _Diabrotica vittata_. The surface of the\r\n  epipharynx is pilose, but the median region is naked, and on the\r\n  anterior half bears from 11 to 12 taste-cups, arranged each side of\r\n  the median line in a rude Y. On each side, at the base of the labial\r\n  region, are two sensitive fields, each bearing about 25 to 26\r\n  taste-cups. More were seen under the clypeus.\r\n\r\n  In the Neuroptera unmistakable taste-cups are not always present. In\r\n  _Sialis infumata_ along the median line of the epipharynx and near\r\n  the front are about 20 scattered gustatory pegs, which are minute,\r\n  but longer and more acute than usual. In _Chauliodes maculatus_\r\n  there are one or two taste-cups under the front edge of the clypeus;\r\n  others are scattered along the middle from the base of the labrum to\r\n  the front, but are not arranged in definite order. In _Corydalis\r\n  cornutus_ no sense-cups, pits, or rods are present. In Chrysopa\r\n  there are scattered cups armed with a short acute bristle, which are\r\n  possibly gustatory in function. In _Myrmeleon diversum_ also the\r\n  presence of sense-pits or of taste-cups is doubtful, though a group\r\n  of about 12 pits on each side of the clypeal region of the\r\n  epipharynx, and a few situated at the base of the labral region, may\r\n  be endowed with the sense of taste. In _Mantispa brunnea_, however,\r\n  along the middle of the epipharynx are scattered about 30\r\n  unmistakable taste-cups, each bearing a short, fine hair.\r\n\r\n  In the Mecoptera (_Panorpa debilis?_) taste-cups, giving rise to a\r\n  minute hair, occur on the labium in two regions, and also on the\r\n  maxillæ situated on the stipes near the base of the palpi, and on\r\n  the lacinia and galea. They are also to be found on the maxillæ of\r\n  _Boreus californicus_, but were not detected on the labium.\r\n\r\n  They were first detected by Reuter in various microlepidoptera, and\r\n  occur on the “basal spot” of the palpi of many butterflies. In a\r\n  Tineid moth (_Coleophora coruscipennella_) we have detected what we\r\n  suppose to be a group of four taste-pits on the inner side of the\r\n  basal joint of the labial palpi.\r\n\r\n=Experimental proof.=—No one, says Lubbock, who has ever watched a bee\r\nor wasp can entertain the slightest doubt as to their possession of the\r\nsense of taste. “Forel mixed morphine and strychnine with some honey,\r\nwhich he offered to his ants. Their antennæ gave them no warning. The\r\nsmell of the honey attracted them, and they began to feed; but the\r\nmoment the honey touched their lips they perceived the fraud.”\r\n\r\nWill at first fed wasps with sugar, so that they frequently visited it;\r\nafterwards he substituted alum for the sugar. Eagerly flying to it, they\r\nhad scarcely touched it when they drew back from the distasteful\r\nsubstance with the most comical gestures, and cleaned their tongues by\r\nfrequently running them in and out, repeatedly stroking them with their\r\nfore feet. He noticed a great repugnance to quinine in nearly all the\r\ninsects experimented on. Bees and wasps were observed to have a more\r\ndelicate gustatory sense than flies, etc., which are more omnivorous in\r\ntheir tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE ORGANS OF TASTE\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Meinert, F.= Bidrag til de danske myrers naturhistorie.

On general grounds if, as we know, many insects\r\nproduce sounds, it must follow that they have ears to hear, for there is\r\nevery reason to suppose that the sounds thus made are, as in other\r\nanimals, either for attracting the sexes, for a means of communication,\r\nor to express the emotions. We will begin by briefly describing the\r\nstructures now generally supposed to be auditory in function, and about\r\nwhich there can be no reasonable doubt, and then consider the more\r\nproblematical organs, closing with an account of the extremely various\r\nmeans of producing sounds and cries.\r\n\r\n=The ears or tympanal and chordotonal sense-organs of Orthoptera and\r\nother insects.=—The ears or tympana of locusts (Acrydiidæ) are situated\r\none on each side, on the basal joint of the abdomen, just behind the\r\nfirst abdominal spiracle. That this is a true ear was first suggested by\r\nJ. Müller, and his opinion was confirmed by Siebold, Leydig, Hensen,\r\nGraber, Schmidt, Lubbock, etc.[49]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 290.—Ear of a locust (_Caloptenus italicus_), seen from the inner\r\n    side: _T_, tympanum; _TR_, its border; _o_, _u_, two horn-like\r\n    processes; _bi_, pear-shaped vesicle; _n_, auditory nerve; _ga_,\r\n    terminal ganglion; _st_, stigma; _m_, opening, and _m′_, closing,\r\n    muscle of the same; _M_, tensor muscle of the tympanum\r\n    membrane.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a tense membrane, the _tympanum_, surrounded\r\nby a horny ring (Fig. 290). “On the internal surface of this membrane\r\nare two horn-like processes (_o_, _u_), to which is attached an\r\nextremely delicate vesicle (_bi_) filled with a transparent fluid, and\r\nrepresenting a membranous labyrinth. This vesicle is in connection with\r\nan auditory nerve (_n_) which arises from the third thoracic ganglion,\r\nforms a ganglion (_ga_) upon the tympanum, and terminates in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the labyrinth by a collection of cuneiform,\r\nstaff-like bodies, with very finely pointed extremities (primitive\r\nnerve-fibres?), which are surrounded by loosely aggregated ganglionic\r\nglobules” (Siebold’s Anatomy of the Invertebrates).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 291.—Fore tibia of _Locusta viridissima_. _td_, cover of the\r\n    drum; _tr_, fissure between the drum and its cover.—After Graber,\r\n    from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the green grasshoppers, katydids, and their allies, the ears are\r\nsituated on the fore tibiæ, where these organs can be found after a\r\ncareful search (Figs. 291, 292).\r\n\r\nThe presence of the structure is indicated by the oval disc, the drum,\r\nwhich is a thin tense membrane covering the auditory apparatus of\r\nnerves, ganglion cells, and auditory rods beneath.\r\n\r\n  The tympana, or drums, are not present in all Locustidæ and\r\n  Gryllidæ, and, as Lubbock states, it is an additional reason for\r\n  regarding them as auditory organs, that in those species which\r\n  possess no stridulating organs the tympana are also wanting. In many\r\n  of the Locustidæ the tympana are covered or protected by a fold of\r\n  the skin projecting over them. These covered ones are, Graber\r\n  thinks, derived from the open ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 292.—_A_, fore tibia of a European grasshopper (Meconema),\r\n    containing the ear: _Ty_, tympanum or outer membrane; _Tr_ 1, _Tr_\r\n    2, tracheæ. _B_, diagrammatic cross-section through the tibia and\r\n    ear of the same; _Ty_, tympanum; _Ct_, cuticula; _CM_, hypodermis:\r\n    _A_, the auditory organ connecting with the tympanum; _B_,\r\n    supra-tympanal auditory organ; _GZ_, the ganglion-cell belonging\r\n    to them; _Hst_, the auditory rod connecting with the\r\n    ganglion-cells.—After Graber, from Judeich and Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn examining the apparatus within the leg under the drum, it is seen to\r\nconsist of the trachea, the auditory vesicles and rods, ganglion cells,\r\nand acoustic nerve. The trachea is greatly modified (Fig. 292, _Tr_ 1).\r\nOn passing into the tibia the trachea enlarges and divides into two\r\nbranches, which reunite lower down. The spiracles supplying the air to\r\nthis enlarged trachea are considerably enlarged, while in the dumb\r\nspecies it is of the normal size. The enlarged trachea passes close to\r\nthe tympanum, which thus has air on both sides of it: the open air on\r\nthe outer, the air of the trachea on its inner surface. In fact, as\r\nLubbock states, “the trachea acts like the Eustachian tube in our own\r\near; it maintains an equilibrium of pressure on each side of the\r\ntympanum, and enables it freely to transmit the atmospheric vibrations.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 293.—The auditory apparatus in the tibia of a grasshopper,\r\n    showing the tympanal nerve-endings in situ: _EBI_, terminal vesicles\r\n    of Siebold’s organ; _SN_, nerve of the organ of Siebold; _Gr_, group\r\n    of vesicles of same; _SO_, nerve-endings of the same; _vT_, front\r\n    tympanum; _vTr_, front branch of the trachea; _hT_, hinder tympanum;\r\n    _hTr_, hinder branch of the trachea; _Sp_, space between the\r\n    tracheæ; _go_, supra tympanal ganglion; _rN_, connecting\r\n    nerve-fibrils between the ganglion cells and the terminal vesicles;\r\n    _R_, upper, _n-S_, lower, root of the transparent covering membrane.\r\n    (Other lettering not explained by author.)—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 294.—Auditory rod of _Gryllus viridissimus_: _fd_, auditory rod;\r\n    _ko_, terminal piece.—After Graber, from Lubbock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  These tracheæ, says Graber, though formed on a similar plan, present\r\n  many variations, corresponding to those of the tympana, and showing\r\n  that the tympana and the tracheæ stand in intimate connection with\r\n  one another. For instance, in those species where the tympana are\r\n  equal, the tracheæ are so likewise; in Gryllotalpa, where the front\r\n  tympanum only is developed, though both tracheal branches are\r\n  present, the front one is much larger than the other; and where\r\n  there is no tympanum, the trachea remains comparatively small, and\r\n  even in some cases undivided (Lubbock, _ex_ Graber).\r\n\r\nThe acoustic nerve, which next to the optic is the thickest in the body,\r\ndivides soon after entering the tibia into two branches, one almost\r\nimmediately forming a ganglion, the supra-tympanal ganglion, the other\r\npassing down to the tympanum, where it expands into an elongated flat\r\nganglion, the organ of Siebold (Fig. 293), and closely applied to the\r\nanterior tracheæ.\r\n\r\nAt the upper part of the ganglion is a group terminating below in a\r\nsingle row of vesicles, the first few of which are approximately equal,\r\nbut which subsequently diminish regularly in size. Each of these\r\nvesicles is connected with the nerve by a fibril (Fig. 293, _vN_), and\r\ncontains an auditory rod (Fig. 294). They are said by Graber to be\r\nbrightly refractive, hollow (thus differing from the retinal rods, which\r\nare solid), and terminate in a separate end-piece (_ko_). The rods were\r\nfirst discovered by Siebold, and, as Lubbock remarks, may be regarded as\r\nspecially characteristic of the acoustic organs of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 295.—Chordotonal organ in nymph of a white ant.—After Müller,\r\n    from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 296.—Right half of 8th body-segment of _Corethra plumicornis_:\r\n    _g_, ganglion of ventral cord; _lm_, longitudinal muscle; _cn_,\r\n    chordotonal nerve; _cl_, chordotonal ligament; _cg_, chordotonal\r\n    ganglion; _cs_, rod of chordotonal organ; _cst_, terminal cord;\r\n    _tb_, tactile setæ; _hn_, out-going fibres of the integumental\r\n    nerves.—After Graber, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  As will be seen in Fig. 293, at the upper part of the tibial organ\r\n  of Ephippigera there is a group of cells, and below them a single\r\n  row of cells gradually diminishing in size from above downwards.\r\n  “One cannot but ask oneself,” says Lubbock, “whether the gradually\r\n  diminishing size of the cells in the organ of Siebold may not have\r\n  reference to the perception of different notes, as is the case with\r\n  the series of diminishing arches in the organ of Corti of our own\r\n  ears.”\r\n\r\n  These organs were supposed to be restricted to the Orthoptera, but\r\n  in 1877 Lubbock discovered what seems to resemble the supra-tympanal\r\n  auditory organ of Orthoptera in the tibia of the yellow ant (_Lasius\r\n  flavus_). Graber confirmed Lubbock’s account, and also discovered\r\n  these organs in the tibia of a Perlid (_Isopteryx apicalis_), and\r\n  Fritz Müller has detected them in the fore tibiæ of the nymph of\r\n  _Calotermes rugosus_ (Fig. 295). To these structures Graber gave the\r\n  name of chordotonal organs.\r\n\r\n  He has also detected these organs in all the legs of other insects\r\n  (Trichoptera, Pediculidæ), and auditory rods have been discovered in\r\n  the antennæ of Dyticus and of Telephorus by Hicks, Leydig, and\r\n  Graber. Graber classifies the chordotonal organs into truncal and\r\n  membral. In Coleoptera and Trichoptera they may occur on several\r\n  joints of the leg; others are more localized,—thus he distinguishes\r\n  femoral (Pediculidæ), tibial (Orthoptera, Perlidæ, Formicidæ), and\r\n  tarsal organs (Coleoptera).\r\n\r\n  A type of chordotonal organ, observed in the body-segments of the\r\n  larvæ of several insects by Leydig, Weismann, Graber, Grobben, and\r\n  Bolles Lee, is to be seen in the transparent larva of Corethra (Fig.\r\n  296), where the auditory organ extends to the skin. It contains at\r\n  the point _cs_ two or three auditory rods. In the opposite direction\r\n  a fine ligament (_cl_) passes from _cg_ to the skin; in this way the\r\n  auditory organ is suspended in a certain state of tension, and is\r\n  favorably situated to receive even very fine vibrations. A similar\r\n  apparatus has been detected in the larva of Ptychoptera.\r\n\r\n=Antennal auditory hairs.=—It is not at all improbable that the antennæ\r\nof different insects contain auditory as well as olfactory structures.\r\nLubbock has suggested that the singular organs which have only been\r\nfound in the antennæ of ants and certain bees, and to which he gives the\r\nname of “Hicks’ bottles” (Fig. 281), may act as microscopic\r\nstethoscopes, while Leydig also regards them as chordotonal organs.\r\n\r\nThat, however, some of the antennal hairs of the mosquito, as first\r\nsuggested by Johnson and afterwards proved experimentally by Mayer, are\r\nauditory, seems well established. Fastening a male mosquito down on a\r\nglass slide, Mayer then sounded a series of tuning-forks. With an Ut_{4}\r\nfork of 512 vibrations per second, some of the hairs were seen to\r\nvibrate vigorously, while others remained comparatively at rest. The\r\nlower (Ut_{3}) and higher (Ut_{5}) harmonics of Ut_{4} also caused more\r\nvibration than any intermediate notes. These hairs, then, are specially\r\ntuned so as to respond to vibrations numbering 512 per second. Other\r\nhairs vibrated to other notes, extending through the middle and next\r\nhigher octave of the piano.\r\n\r\nMayer then made large wooden models of these hairs, the one\r\ncorresponding to the Ut_{3} hair being about a metre in length, and on\r\ncounting the number of vibrations they made when they were clamped at\r\none end and then drawn on one side, he found that it “coincided with the\r\nratio existing between the numbers of vibrations of the forks to which\r\ncovibrated the fibrils,” or hairs. It should be observed that the song\r\nof the female mosquito corresponds nearly to this note, and would\r\nconsequently set the hairs in vibration. Mayer observed that the song of\r\nthe female vibrates the hairs of one of the antennæ more forcibly than\r\nthose of the other. Those auditory hairs are most affected which are at\r\nright angles to the direction from which the sound comes. Hence from the\r\nposition of the antennæ and the hairs a sound will be loudest or most\r\nintense if it is directly in front of the head. If, then, the song of\r\nthe female affects one antenna more than another, the male turns his\r\nhead until the two antennæ are equally affected, and is thus able to fly\r\nstraight towards the female. From his experiments Mayer found that the\r\nmale can thus guide himself to within 5° of the direction of the female.\r\nHence he concludes that “these insects must have the faculty of the\r\nperception of the direction of sound more highly developed than in any\r\nother class of animals.” (Also see Child’s work.)\r\n\r\n  =Special sense-organs in the wings and halteres.=—Organs of a\r\n  special sense, which Hicks supposed to be those of smell, were found\r\n  by him near or at the base of the wings of Diptera, Coleoptera, and\r\n  less perfect ones in Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, and Orthoptera, with a\r\n  trace of them in Hemiptera; but these were considered by Leydig to\r\n  be auditory organs, since he found the nerves to end in club-shaped\r\n  rods, like those of Orthoptera.\r\n\r\n  Hicks found, as to the halteres and their sense-organs, that the\r\n  nerve in the halter is the largest in the insect, except the optic\r\n  nerve; and that at the base of the halteres is a number of vesicles\r\n  arranged in four groups, to each of which the nerve sends a branch.\r\n  Afterwards Bolles Lee discovered that the vesicles, undoubtedly\r\n  perforated, contain a minute hair, those of the upper groups being\r\n  protected by hoods of chitin. He regarded them as olfactory organs,\r\n  while Lubbock seems inclined to consider them as auditory\r\n  structures. Graber also regards the vesicles of Hicks as chordotonal\r\n  organs.\r\n\r\n  In his elaborate account of the balancers, Weinland concludes that\r\n  the organs of sense of varying structure occurring at the base of\r\n  these appendages allow the perception of movements which the\r\n  halteres perform and which enable the fly to steer or direct its\r\n  course. The halteres can thus cause differences in the direction of\r\n  the flight of a fly in the vertical plane. If the balancers act\r\n  unequally, there is a change in direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _e._ The sounds of insects\r\n\r\nInsects have no true voice; but sounds of different intensity, shrill\r\ncries, and other noises are produced mechanically by insects, either\r\nbeing love-songs to attract the sexes, to give signals, to communicate\r\nintelligence, or perhaps to express the emotions. The loud, shrill cry\r\nof the Cicada, or chirp of the cricket, is evidently a love-call, and\r\nresults in the mating of individuals of separate broods more or less\r\nwidely scattered, thus preventing too close interbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe simplest means of making a noise is that of the death-watch\r\n(Anobium), which strikes or taps on the wall with its head or abdomen.\r\nLongicorn beetles make a sharp sound by the friction of the\r\nmesoscutellum against the edge of the prothoracic cavity, the head being\r\nalternately raised and lowered, Burying-beetles (Necrophorus) rub the\r\nabdomen against the hinder edges of the elytra. Weevils make a loud\r\nnoise by rapidly rubbing the tips of the abdomen on the ends of the\r\nelytra.\r\n\r\n  Landois offers the following summary of the kinds of noises produced\r\n  by beetles:\r\n\r\n    1. Tapping sounds (Bostrycinæ, Anobium).\r\n\r\n    2. Grating sounds (Elateridæ).\r\n\r\n    3. Friction without special rasping organs (_Euchirus\r\n         longimanus_).\r\n\r\n    4. Rasping sounds produced by friction:\r\n\r\n        _a._ Rubbing of the pronotum on the mesonotum (Cerambycidæ\r\n         except Spondyli and Prionus).\r\n\r\n       _b._ Friction of the prosternum on the mesosternum (_Omaloplia\r\n         brunnea_).\r\n\r\n       _c._ Elytra with a rasp at the end (Curculionidæ, Dyticidæ,\r\n         Pelobius).\r\n\r\n        _d._ With a coxal rasp (Geotrupes, Ceratophyus). The male of\r\n         Ateuchus stridulates to encourage the female in her work, and\r\n         from distress when she is removed. (Darwin.)\r\n\r\n       _e._ Friction of the edge of the elytra against the femur\r\n         (_Chiasognathus grantii_).\r\n\r\n       _f._ Pygidium with two rasps in the middle (Crioceris, Lema,\r\n         Copris, Oryctes, Necrophorus, Tenebrionidæ).\r\n\r\n        _g._ Abdomen with a grating ridge and four grating plates\r\n         (Trox).\r\n\r\n       _h._ Abdomen with two toothed ridges rubbing on a rasp on edge\r\n         of wing-cover (Elaphus, Blethisa, Cychrus).\r\n\r\n       _i._ Rubbing the elytra on a rasp on the hind wings (_Pelobius\r\n         hermanni_).\r\n\r\n        _j._ Friction of the wing against the abdominal segments\r\n         (_Melolontha fullo_).\r\n\r\n  Mutilla makes a rather sharp noise by rubbing one abdominal segment\r\n  against another. Ants (Ponera) have a stridulating apparatus, and\r\n  other genera numerous (20) ridges between the segments.\r\n\r\n  Even certain moths and butterflies emit a rasping or crackling\r\n  noise. The death’s-head moth and other sphinges cause it by rubbing\r\n  the palpi against the base of the proboscis. These and certain\r\n  butterflies are provided with parallel ridges forming a rasp on the\r\n  “basal spot” of the inner side of the basal joint of each palpus\r\n  (Reuter). A South American butterfly (_Ageronia feronia_) can be\r\n  heard for several yards as it flies with a crackling sound. Hampson\r\n  finds that the cause of the clicking sound is due to a pair of\r\n  strong chitinous hooks attached to the thorax, against which play\r\n  the spatulate ends of a pair of hooks attached to the fore wings. An\r\n  Australian moth (Hecatesia) flies with a whizzing sound; Vanessa is\r\n  said to be sonorous.\r\n\r\n  The males of Orthoptera produce their shrill cries or chirping\r\n  noises, 1, by rubbing the thighs against the sides of the body\r\n  (Acrydiidæ); 2, by the friction of the base of the fore wings on\r\n  each other (Locustidæ); 3, by rubbing the base of the upper on the\r\n  base of the hinder or under pair (Gryllidæ), in the two last there\r\n  being a shrilling apparatus consisting of a file on the hind wings,\r\n  which rubs on a resonant surface on the fore wings. The females are\r\n  not invariably dumb, both sexes of the European Ephippigera being\r\n  able to faintly stridulate. Corixa also produces shrill chirping\r\n  notes. (Carpenter.)\r\n\r\nCertain insects also hum, and have what may perhaps be called a voice.\r\nThe cockchafer, besides humming with the wings, produces a sound almost\r\nlike a voice. In the large trachea, just behind each spiracle, is a\r\nchitinous process, which is thrown into vibrations by the air during\r\nrespiration, and thus produces a humming noise. (Lubbock.) Such is also\r\nthe case with flies, the mosquito, dragon-flies, and bees. In flies and\r\ndragon-flies the “voice” is caused by the air issuing from the thoracic\r\nspiracles; while in the humble-bee the abdominal spiracles are also\r\nmusical. The sound made by the spiracles bears no relation to that\r\ncaused by the wings. Landois tells us that the wing-tone of the\r\nhoney-bee is A′; its voice, however, is an octave higher, and often goes\r\nto B″ and C″.\r\n\r\nThe sounds produced by the wings are constant in each species, except\r\nwhere, as in Bombus, there are individuals of different sizes; in these\r\nthe larger ones generally give a higher note. Thus the comparatively\r\nsmall male of _Bombus terrestris_ hums on A′, while the large female\r\nhums an entire octave higher.\r\n\r\nFrom the note produced the rapidity of the vibrations can be calculated.\r\nFor example, the house-fly, which produces the sound of F, vibrates its\r\nwings 21,120 times in a minute, or 335 times in a second; and the bee,\r\nwhich makes a sound of A′, as many as 26,400 times, or 440 times in a\r\nsecond. On the contrary, a tired bee hums on E′, and therefore,\r\naccording to theory, vibrates its wings only 330 times in a second.\r\nMarey has confirmed these numbers graphically, and found by experiment\r\nthat the fly actually makes 330 strokes in a second. (Lubbock.)\r\n\r\nA different kind of musical apparatus is that of the cicada, which has\r\nbeen elaborately described by Graber. The shrill, piercing notes issue\r\nfrom a pair of organs on the under side of the base of the abdomen of\r\nthe male, these acting somewhat as two kettle-drums, the membrane\r\ncovering the depressions being rapidly vibrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LITERATURE ON THE ORGANS OF HEARING\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _a._ The auditory organs\r\n\r\n  =Siebold, C.

In a\r\nHemipter (_Pyrrhocoris apterus_) appendages arise from the intestine in\r\nfront of the origin of the urinary tubes. In certain insects a single\r\ncœcal appendage (Nepa, Dyticus, Silpha, Necrophorus, and the\r\nLepidoptera) arises from the proctodæum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 301—Larva of honey-bee: _g_, brain; _bm_, ventral nervous cord;\r\n    _œ_, œsophagus; _sd_, spinning-gland; _cd_, mid-intestine or\r\n    chyle-stomach; _ed_, hind-intestine, not yet connected with the\r\n    mid-intestine; _vm_, urinary tube; _an_, anus; _st_, stigmata.—After\r\n    Leuckart, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn certain larval insects, as those of the Proctotrypidæ (first larval\r\nstage), the higher Hymenoptera (ichneumons, ants, wasps, and bees, Fig.\r\n301), in the Campodea-like larvæ of the Meloidæ and Stylopidæ, the larva\r\nof the ant-lion (Myrmecoleo), and those of _Diptera pupipara_\r\n(Melophagus), the embryonic condition of the separation of the\r\nproctodæum and mid-gut (mesenteron) persists, the stomach ending in a\r\nblind sac; in such cases the intestine, together with the urinary tubes,\r\nis entirely secretory.\r\n\r\nThe anus is wanting in the larva of the ant-lion, as also in the wasps\r\n(in which there is a rudimentary colon) and in freshly hatched bees,\r\nthough it becomes perfectly formed in the fully grown larvæ (Newport,\r\nart. Insecta, p. 967, and H. Müller).\r\n\r\nIn the larvæ of lamellicorn Coleoptera (_Melolontha vulgaris_) the\r\ndigestive tube is nearly as simple as in bees, though there is a large\r\ncolon, which at its beginning forms an immense cœcum, and has also one\r\nanal aperture (Newport).\r\n\r\nThe length and shape of the digestive canal is dependent on the nature\r\nof the food and also on the mode of life, especially the ease or\r\ndifficulty with which the food is digested.\r\n\r\n  Newport, while stating that the length of the alimentary canal in\r\n  larvæ is not in general indicatory of the habits of the species,\r\n  makes this qualification after describing the digestive canal of\r\n  Calandra as compared with that of Calosoma: “The length and\r\n  complication of the intestines, therefore, appear to have some\r\n  reference to the quality of the food to be digested, since it is\r\n  well known that the food of these latter insects (weevils) is of\r\n  difficult assimilation, being as it is chiefly the hard ligneous\r\n  fibres of vegetable matter; but they cannot be received as always\r\n  indicatory of a carnivorous [or] vegetable feeder, since, as above\r\n  remarked, the length of the canal is considerable in one entirely\r\n  carnivorous larva, while it is much shorter in some herbivorous, and\r\n  particularly in pollenivorous larvæ, as in the Melolontha and the\r\n  apodal Hymenoptera.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302.—Digestive canal of a carabid beetle: _b_, œsophagus; _c_,\r\n    crop; _d_, proventriculus; _f_, mid-intestine, or “chyle-stomach,”\r\n    with its cœeca; _g_, posterior division of the stomach; _i_, the\r\n    two pairs of urinary tubes; _h_, intestine; _k_, rectum; _l_, anal\r\n    glands.—After Dufour, from Judeich and Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Newport also contends that the length of the alimentary canal is not\r\n  more indicative in the perfect insect of the carnivorous or\r\n  phytophagous habits of the species than in the larva. It is nearly\r\n  as long (being from two to three times the length of the whole\r\n  body), and is more complicated, in the rapacious Carabidæ (Fig. 302)\r\n  than in the honey-sipping Lepidoptera, whose food is entirely\r\n  liquid. Referring to the digestive canal of Cicindelidæ, which is\r\n  scarcely longer than the body, he claims that “we cannot admit that\r\n  the length of the digestive organs, and the existence of a gizzard\r\n  and gastric vessels, are indicatory of predacity of habits in the\r\n  insect, because a similar conformation of parts exists often in\r\n  strictly vegetable feeders. The existence and length of these parts\r\n  seem rather to refer to the comparative digestibility of the food\r\n  than to its animal or vegetable nature.” Newport then refers to the\r\n  digestive canal of Forficulidæ (in which the gizzard is present, the\r\n  canal, however, passing in an almost direct line through the body,\r\n  making but one slight convolution), “a farther proof that the\r\n  _length_ of the canal must not be taken as a criterion whereby to\r\n  judge of the habits of a species.” He adds this will apply equally\r\n  well to the omnivorous Gryllidæ, in which there exists a short\r\n  alimentary canal, but a gizzard of more complicated structure than\r\n  that of the Dytiscidæ.\r\n\r\nIn larval insects and others (Synaptera, Orthoptera, etc.), in which the\r\ndigestive canal is simplest, it is scarcely longer than the body, and\r\npasses through it as a straight tube.\r\n\r\nIn the caterpillar, which is a voracious and constant feeder, the\r\ndigestive canal is a large straight tube, not clearly differentiated\r\ninto fore-stomach, stomach, and intestine; but in the imago, which only\r\ntakes a little liquid food, it is slender, delicate, and highly\r\ndifferentiated. In the larva the mid-gut forms the largest part of the\r\ncanal; in the imago, the intestine becomes very long and coiled into\r\nnumerous turns; at the same time the food-reservoir (the “sucking\r\nstomach”) develops, and the excretory tubes are longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _a._ The digestive canal\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 303.—Interior view of the bottom of the head of _Danais\r\n    archippus_, the top having been cut away, showing, in the middle,\r\n    the pharyngeal sac with its five muscles: the frontal (_f.m_),\r\n    dorsal pair (_d.m_), and the lateral pair (_l.m_); _cl_, clypeus;\r\n    _cor_, cornea; _œ_, œsophagus; _p.m_, one of the large muscles which\r\n    move the labial palp.—After Burgess.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will greatly simplify our conception of the anatomy of the digestive\r\ncanal if we take into account its mode of origin in the embryo, bearing\r\nin mind the fact that during the gastrula condition the ectoderm is\r\ninvaginated at each pole to form the primitive mouth and fore-gut\r\n(stomodæum) and hind-gut (proctodæum). The cells of the ectoderm secrete\r\na chitinous lining (intima), which forms the continuation of the outer\r\nchitinous crust, and thus the lining of each end of the digestive canal\r\nis cast whenever the insect molts; while the mid-intestine (mesenteron),\r\narising independently of the rest of the canal much later in embryonic\r\nlife from the mesoderm, is not the result of any invagination, being\r\ndirectly derived from the mesoderm, and is not lined with chitin.\r\n\r\n=The mouth, or oral cavity, and pharynx.=—This is the beginning of the\r\nalimentary bounded above by the clypeus, and labrum, with the\r\nepipharynx, and below by the hypopharynx, or tongue, as well as the\r\nlabium. Into it pour the secretion of the salivary glands, which passes\r\nout through an opening at the base of the tongue or hypopharynx. On each\r\nside of the mouth are the mandibles and first maxillæ.\r\n\r\n=The sucking or pharyngeal pump.=—This organ has been observed by Graber\r\nin flies and Hemiptera, but the fullest account is that by Burgess, who\r\nwas the first to discover it in Lepidoptera. In the milk-weed butterfly\r\n(_Danais archippus_) the canal traversing the proboscis opens into a\r\npharynx enclosed in a muscular sac (Figs. 303, 304, and 310).\r\n\r\nThe pharyngeal sac, says Burgess, serves as a pumping organ to suck the\r\nliquid food through the proboscis and to force it backwards into the\r\ndigestive canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 304.—Longitudinal section through the head of Danais, showing the\r\n    interior of the left half: _mx_, left maxilla, whose canal leads\r\n    into the pharynx; _hph_, floor of the latter, showing some of the\r\n    taste-papillæ; _oe_, œsophagus; _ep_, epipharyngeal valve; _sd_,\r\n    salivary duct; _d.m_, _f.m_, and _cl_, as in Fig. 302.—After\r\n    Burgess.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMeinert (“Trophi Dipterorum”) has made elaborate dissections of the\r\nmouth and its armature, including the pharynx of several types of\r\nDiptera, with its musculature. He describes the pharynx as the\r\nprincipal, and in most Diptera, as the only part of the pump (antlia),\r\nand says: “By the muscles of the pump (_musculis antliæ_) the superior\r\nlamina of the pharynx is varied that the space between the two laminæ\r\nmay be increased, and the liquid is thus led through the siphon formed\r\nby the mouth-parts into the mouth” (Fig. 81).\r\n\r\n=The œsophagus.=—This is a simple tube, largest in those insects feeding\r\non solid, usually vegetable, food, and smallest in those living on\r\nliquid food. It usually curves upwards and backwards, passing directly\r\nunder the brain, and merges into the crop or proventriculus either at\r\nthe back part of the head or in the thorax, its length being very\r\nvariable. Its inner walls longitudinally are folded and lined with\r\nchitin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Newport, in the œsophagus of the Gryllidæ, of the two\r\nlayers of the mucous lining the second is distinctly glandular and\r\nsecretory, and in it there are many thousands of very minute granular\r\nglandular bodies, which probably secrete the “molasses” or repellent\r\nfluid often ejected by these and other insects when captured.\r\n\r\n=The crop or ingluvies.=—This, when present, is an enlargement of the\r\nend of the œsophagus, and lined internally with a muscular coat. It is\r\nvery large in locusts (Fig. 298), Anabrus (Fig. 299), and other\r\nOrthoptera (the Phasmidæ excepted), in the Dermaptera, and most adult\r\nColeoptera. A crop-like dilatation in front of a spherical gizzard is\r\nalso present in the Synaptera (Poduridæ and Lepismidæ), as well as in\r\nthe Mallophaga (Nirmidæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 305.—Digestive canal of Calandra: _H_, pear-shaped œsophagus;\r\n    _I_, crop; _K_, gastric cœca _L_, ilium; _MN_, colon; _P_, urinary\r\n    tubes.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 306.—Section of the crop (_H_), gizzard (_I_), and stomach (_K_)\r\n    of Athalia.-After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 307._—Upper side of head and digestive canal of Myrmeleon larva:\r\n    _a_, crop; _b_, “stomach”; _c_, free ends of two urinary tubes;\r\n    _c′_, common origin of other six tubes; _d_, cœcum; _e_, spinneret;\r\n    _ff_, muscles for protruding its sheath; _gg_, maxillary\r\n    glands.—After Meinert, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the larvæ of weevils (_Calandra sommeri_) there is a crop (Fig. 305),\r\nbut not in the larva of Calosoma; also, according to Beauregard, in the\r\npollen-eating beetles Zonitis, Sitaris, and Malabris it is wanting,\r\nwhile in Meloe it is highly developed (Kolbe).\r\n\r\nThe crop forms a lateral dilatation of the end of the œsophagus in the\r\nlarvæ of weevils and of saw-flies (_Athalia centifoliæ_, Fig. 306).\r\n\r\n=The “sucking stomach” or food-reservoir.=—This is a thin muscular pouch\r\nconnected by a slender neck with the end of the œsophagus or the crop,\r\nwhen the latter is present. There is no such organ in Orthoptera, except\r\nin Gryllotalpa. It is wanting in the Odonata and in the Plectoptera\r\n(Ephemeridæ); in Platyptera (Perlidæ and Termitidæ), in Trichoptera, and\r\nin Mecoptera (Panorpidæ). In most adult Neuroptera (Myrmeleonidæ,\r\nHemerobiidæ, and Sialidæ), but not in Rhaphidiidæ, the long œsophagus is\r\ndilated posteriorly into a kind of pouch or crop, and besides there is\r\noften a long “food-reservoir” arising on one of its sides, that of\r\nMyrmeleon (Fig. 307) and Hemerobius being on the right side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 308.—Digestive canal of _Sarcophaga carnaria_: _a_, salivary\r\n    gland; _b_, œsophagus; _c_, food reservoir; _f-g_, stomach; _h_,\r\n    intestine; _i_, urinary tubes; _k_, rectum.—From Judeich and\r\n    Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA true food-reservoir is present in most Diptera (Fig. 308) as well as\r\nin the larvæ of the Muscidæ, but according to Dufour it is wanting in\r\nsome Asilidæ and in _Diptera pupipara_, and according to Brauer in the\r\nŒstridæ. The food-reservoir in Diptera is always situated on the left\r\nside of the digestive canal; there is usually a long neck or canal,\r\nwhile the reservoir is either oval or more usually bilobed, and often\r\neach lobe is itself curiously lobed.\r\n\r\nIn Lepidoptera (Figs. 309, 310) the so-called “sucking stomach” is, as\r\nGraber has proved, simply a reservoir for the temporary reception of\r\nfood; though generally found to contain nothing but air, Newport has\r\nobserved that in flies it is filled with food after feeding. He has\r\nfound this to be the case in the flesh fly, and in Eristalis he has\r\nfound it “partially filled with yellow pollen from the flowers of the\r\nragwort upon which the insect was captured,” the pollen grains also\r\noccurring in the canal leading to the bag, in the gullet, and in the\r\nstomach itself. Graber has further proved by feeding flies with a\r\ncolored sweet fluid that this sac is only a food-receptacle. As he says:\r\n“It can be seen filling itself fuller and fuller with the colored fluid,\r\nthe sac gradually distending until it occupies half the hind-body.”\r\n\r\nThe food-reservoir of the Hymenoptera is a lateral pouch at the end of\r\nthe long, slender œsophagus, and has been seen in the bee to be filled\r\nwith honey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 309.—Digestive canal of _Sphinx ligustri_: _h_, œsophagus; _i_,\r\n    rudiment of the gizzard; _k_, “stomach”; _q_, its pyloric end; _t_,\r\n    food reservoir; _p_, urinary tubes; _l_, ilium; _m_, cœcum of colon;\r\n    _n_, rectum; _v_, vent.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the mole-cricket the hinder part of the crop is armed within with\r\nhook-like bristles directed backwards so as not to prevent the energetic\r\npressure of the food backwards into the proventriculus, and to obviate\r\nthe possibility of a regurgitation. (Eberli.)\r\n\r\n=The fore-stomach or proventriculus.=—This is especially well developed\r\nin the Dermaptera, in the Orthopterous families Locustidæ, Gryllidæ, and\r\nMantidæ, while in the Thysanura (Lepisma) there is a spherical gizzard\r\nprovided with six teeth. It also occurs in many wood-boring insects, and\r\nin most carnivorous insects, notably the Carabidæ, Dyticidæ, Scolytidæ,\r\nin the Mecoptera (scorpion-flies), in the fleas, and in many kinds of\r\nants, as well as Cynips, Leucospis, and Xyphidria. It is very muscular,\r\nlined within with chitin, which is usually provided with numerous teeth\r\narising from the folds. These folds begin in the œsophagus or crop, and\r\nsuddenly end where the mesenteron (“chylific stomach”) begins. It has\r\nbeen compared with the gizzard of birds, and is usually called by German\r\nauthors the chewing or masticating stomach. (Kaumagen.)\r\n\r\n  The proventriculus is best developed in the Gryllidæ (_Acrida\r\n  viridissima_), where the six folds at the end of the crop close\r\n  together to form a valve between the crop and proventriculus. “They\r\n  are each armed with five very minute hooked teeth; and, continued\r\n  into the gizzard, develop many more in their course through that\r\n  organ. These first teeth are arranged around the entrance to the\r\n  gizzard, and seem designed to retain the insufficiently comminuted\r\n  food and to pass it on to that organ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 310.—Anatomy of _Danais archippus_ after removal of right half\r\n    of the body. _Lettering of the head_: _a_, antenna; _ph_, pharynx;\r\n    _pl_, labial palpi; _r_, proboscis; _g_, brain; _usg_,\r\n    subœsophageal ganglion. _Lettering of the thorax_: I.

These extend about\r\n  half-way through the gizzard. They appear to be alternately elevated\r\n  and depressed during the action of the gizzard, and to serve to\r\n  carry on the food to the twelve cutting teeth, with which each ridge\r\n  is also armed, and which occupy the posterior part of the organ.\r\n  These teeth are triangular, sharp-pointed, and directed posteriorly,\r\n  and gradually decrease in size in succession from before backward.\r\n  Each tooth is very strong, sharp-pointed, and of the color and\r\n  consistence of tortoise shell, and is armed on each side by a\r\n  smaller pointed tooth. These form the six longitudinal ridges of the\r\n  gizzard, between each two of which there are two other rows of very\r\n  minute teeth of a triangular form, somewhat resembling the larger\r\n  one in structure, occupying the channels between the ridges. The\r\n  muscular portion of the gizzard is equally interesting. It is not\r\n  merely formed of transverse and longitudinal fibres, but sends from\r\n  its inner surface into the cavity of each of the large teeth other\r\n  minute but powerful muscles, a pair of which are inserted into each\r\n  tooth. The number of teeth in the gizzard amounts to 270, which is\r\n  the same number in these Gryllidæ as found formerly by Dr. Kidd in\r\n  the mole-cricket. Of the different kinds of teeth there are as\r\n  follows: 72 large treble teeth, 24 flat quadrate teeth, 30 small\r\n  single-hooked teeth, and 12 rows of small triangular teeth, each row\r\n  being formed of 12 teeth. This is the complicated gizzard of the\r\n  higher Orthoptera.” (Newport.)\r\n\r\n  In the more generalized cockroach, there are six principal folds,\r\n  the so-called teeth, which project so far inwards as to nearly meet\r\n  (Fig. 312). The entire apparatus of muscles and teeth is, as Miall\r\n  and Denny state, “an elaborate machine for squeezing and straining\r\n  the food, and recalls the gastric mill and pyloric strainer of the\r\n  crayfish. The powerful annular muscles approximate the teeth and\r\n  folds, closing the passage, while small longitudinal muscles, which\r\n  can be traced from the chitinous teeth to the cushions, appear to\r\n  retract these last, and open a passage for the food.”\r\n\r\nAs in the fore-stomach or proventriculus of the lobster, the solid,\r\nrounded teeth do not appear to triturate the solid fragments found in\r\nthe organ, but act rather as a pyloric strainer to keep such bodies out\r\nof the chylific stomach. We accept the view of Plateau that this section\r\nof the digestive canal in insects, which he compares to the psalterium\r\nof a ruminant, is a strainer rather than a masticatory stomach, and both\r\nForel and Emery, as well as Cheshire, take this view.\r\n\r\nThe proventriculus of the honey-bee (Fig. 313, _hs_) is called by\r\napiarians the “honey-sac” or “honey-stomach.” Cheshire states that if it\r\nbe carefully removed from a freshly killed bee, its calyx-like\r\n“stomach-mouth” may be seen to gape open and shut with a rapid snapping\r\nmovement. The entrance to the stomach is guarded by four valves, each of\r\nwhich is strongly chitinous within, and fringed along its edge with\r\ndownward-pointing fine stiff bristles. By the contraction of the\r\nlongitudinal muscles (_lm_), the valves open to allow the passage of\r\nfood from the honey-sac to the “chyle-stomach.” It is closed at will by\r\ncircular muscles (_tm_). Then the bee can carry food for a week’s\r\nnecessities, either using it rapidly in the production of wax, or eking\r\nit out if the weather is unfavorable for the gathering of a new store.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 314.—“Honey-sac stopper,” “stomach-mouth,” or calyx-bell of\r\n    honey-bee, × 50. _A_, front view of one of the lobes of the\r\n    calyx-bell; _l_, lip-like point, covered by down-turned bristles\r\n    (_b_); _sm_, side membrane. _B_, longitudinal section of the\r\n    stomach-mouth, with continuations into entrance of chyle-stomach;\r\n    _l_, _l_, lip-like ends of leaflets; _s_, setæ; _lm_, longitudinal\r\n    muscles; _tm_, transverse muscles in cross-section; _cl_, cell-layer\r\n    of honey-sac; _LM_, _TM_, longitudinal and transverse muscles of\r\n    same; _nc_, nucleated cells of tubular extension of stomach-mouth\r\n    into chyle-stomach; _lm′_, _tm′_, longitudinal and transverse\r\n    muscles of chyle stomach; _c_, _c_, cells covered within by an\r\n    intima. _C_, cross-section of stomach-mouth; _m_, cross-section of\r\n    muscles seen at _lm_ in _B_; _tm_, transverse muscles surrounding\r\n    stomach-mouth. _D_, cross-section through small intestine; _a_ and\r\n    _m_, longitudinal and surrounding muscles.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Cheshire also shows that when bees suck up from composite and other\r\n  flowers nectar together with much pollen, the outside wrinkled\r\n  membrane (_sm_, _A_, Fig. 314) “is seen to continually run up in\r\n  folds, and gather itself over the top of the stomach-mouth, bringing\r\n  with it, by the aid of its setæ, the large pollen-grains the nectar\r\n  contains.” The lips (_l_, _l_, _B_, Fig. 314), now opening, take in\r\n  this pollen, which is driven forwards into the cavity made between\r\n  the separating lips by an inflow of the fluid surrounding the\r\n  granules. The lips in turn close, but the down-pointing bristles are\r\n  thrown outwards from the face of the leaflet, in this way revealing\r\n  their special function, as the pollen is prevented from receding\r\n  while the nectar passes back into the honey-sac, strained through\r\n  between the bristles aforesaid, the last parts escaping by the\r\n  loop-like openings seen in the corners of _C_, Fig. 314. The whole\r\n  process is immediately and very rapidly repeated, so that the pollen\r\n  collects and the honey is cleared. “Three purposes, in addition to\r\n  those previously enumerated, are thus subserved by this wondrous\r\n  mechanism. First, the bee can either _eat or drink_ from the mixed\r\n  diet she carries, gulping down the pollen in pellets, or swallowing\r\n  the nectar as her necessities demand. Second, when the collected\r\n  pollen is driven forwards into the chyle-stomach, the tube\r\n  extension, whose necessity now becomes apparent, prevents the\r\n  pellets forming into plug-like masses just below _p_, Fig. 313, for,\r\n  by the action of the tube, these pellets are delivered into the\r\n  midst of the fluids of the stomach, to be at once broken up and\r\n  subjected to the digestive process. And third, while the little\r\n  gatherer is flying from flower to flower, her stomach-mouth is busy\r\n  in separating pollen from nectar, so that the latter may be less\r\n  liable to fermentation and better suited to winter consumption. She,\r\n  in fact, carries with her, and at once puts into operation, the most\r\n  ancient, and yet the most perfect and beautiful, of all\r\n  ‘honey-strainers.’”\r\n\r\n  Forel’s experiments on the proventriculus of ants prove that through\r\n  its valvular contrivance it closes the passage from the crop to the\r\n  mid-intestine (“chylific stomach”), and allows the contents of the\r\n  former to pass slowly and very gradually into the latter. Emery\r\n  confirms this view, and concludes that the organ in the Camponotidæ\r\n  and in the Dolichoderidæ provided with a calyx-bell, usually\r\n  regarded as a triturating stomach (Kaumagen), but more correctly as\r\n  a pumping stomach, consists of parts which perform two different\r\n  functions. Under the operation of the muscles of the crop the\r\n  entrance to the pumping stomach becomes closed, in order by such\r\n  spasmodic contraction to prevent the flow of the contents of the\r\n  crop into the proventriculus. By the pressure of the transverse\r\n  muscles of the proventriculus its contents are emptied into the\r\n  mid-intestine, while simultaneously a regurgitation into the crop is\r\n  prevented. In the Dolichoderidæ and Plagiolepidinæ the closure in\r\n  both cases is effected by the valves. In the true Camponotidæ there\r\n  are two separate contrivances for closing; the calyx belonging to\r\n  the crop-musculature, while the valves essentially belong to the\r\n  proventricular pumping apparatus.\r\n\r\n  Opinions vary as to the use of this portion of the digestive canal.\r\n  Graber compares it to the gizzard of birds, and likens the action of\r\n  the rosette of teeth to the finer radiating teeth of the sea-urchin,\r\n  and styles it a chopping machine, which works automatically, and\r\n  allows no solid bits of food to pass in to injure the delicate walls\r\n  of the stomach (mid-gut).\r\n\r\n  He also states that the food when taken from the proventriculus is\r\n  very finely divided, while that found in the œsophagus contains\r\n  large bits.\r\n\r\n  Kolbe says that this view has recently been completely abandoned,\r\n  and that the teeth are used to pass the food backwards into the\r\n  chylific stomach. “But Goldfuss had denied the triturating action of\r\n  the proventriculus of the Orthoptera (Symbolæ ad Orthopterorum\r\n  quorundam Œconomiam, 1843), stating that the contents of the same\r\n  are already fluid in the gullet, so that the fore-stomach (Kaumagen)\r\n  does not need to comminute the food” (Kolbe). In the Gryllidæ and\r\n  Locustidæ, just before the posterior opening of the proventriculus\r\n  into the stomach the chitinous lining swells into a ring and\r\n  projects straight back as the inner wall of the cylindrical chylific\r\n  stomach. The muscular layer forms two sac-like outgrowths or folds,\r\n  which separate on the circular fold from the chitinous membrane.\r\n  This apparatus only allows very finely comminuted food to pass into\r\n  the stomach.\r\n\r\n  In the Acrydiidæ (_Eremobia muricata_) at the end of the\r\n  proventriculus, where it passes into the stomach, is a small\r\n  circular fold which hangs down like a curtain in the stomach.\r\n\r\n=The œsophageal valve.=—Weismann[50] states that the origin of the\r\nproventriculus in the embryo of flies (Muscidæ) shows that it should be\r\nregarded as an intussusception of the œsophagus. While in the embryo the\r\ninvaginated portion of the œsophagus is short, after the hatching of the\r\nlarva it projects backwards into the mid-intestine. Kowalevsky also\r\nobserved in a young muscid larva, 2.2 mm. in length, that the œsophagus,\r\nshaped like a tube, extends back into the expanded portion\r\n(proventriculus) and opens into the stomach (Fig. 315, _A_). In a larva\r\n10 mm. long the funnel is shorter, the end being situated in the\r\nproventriculus (Fig. 315, _B_, _pr_). In the cavity between the outer\r\n(_o_) and inner wall (_i_) no food enters, and the use of this whole\r\napparatus seems to be to prevent the larger bits of food from passing\r\ninto the chylific stomach (Kowalevsky).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 315.—Œsophageal valve of young muscid larva: _m_, its opening:\r\n    _t_, thickening of the cells; _mes_, mesoderm.—After Kowalevsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Beauregard has found a similar structure in the Meloidæ, and calls\r\n  it the “cardiac valvule” (Fig. 318, _Kl_). It was observed by\r\n  Mingazzini in the larvæ of phytophagic lamellicorn beetles, and\r\n  Balbiani described it in a myriopod (Cryptops) under the name of the\r\n  “œsophageal valvule.”\r\n\r\n  Gehuchten describes a homologous but more complicated structure in a\r\n  tipulid larva (_Ptychoptera contaminata_), but differing in\r\n  containing blood-cavities, as a tubular prolongation of the\r\n  posterior end of the œsophagus which passes through the\r\n  proventriculus and opens at various positions in the anterior part\r\n  of the chylific stomach (Fig. 316).\r\n\r\n  The three layers composing this funnel are distant from each other\r\n  and separated by blood-cavities, the whole forming “an immense\r\n  blood-cavity extended between the epithelial proventricular lining\r\n  and the muscular coat.”\r\n\r\n  According to Schneider the longitudinal muscular fibres of the fore\r\n  and hind gut in insects pass into the stomach (mid-gut). The\r\n  anterior part of the fore-gut has generally only circular fibres.\r\n  When, however, the longitudinal fibres arise behind the middle, then\r\n  they separate from the digestive canal and are inserted a little\r\n  behind the beginning of the chylific stomach. Hence there is formed\r\n  an invagination of the proventriculus, which projects into the\r\n  cavity of the stomach.\r\n\r\n  Schneider describes this process, which he calls the “beak,” as an\r\n  invagination of the fore-stomach which projects into the cavity of\r\n  the stomach. The two layers of the invagination in growing together\r\n  form a beak varying in shape, being either simple or lobed and armed\r\n  with bristles or teeth. This beak is tolerably large in Lepisma,\r\n  Dermaptera (Forficula), Orthoptera, and in the larvæ and adults of\r\n  Diptera, but smaller in the Neuroptera and Coleoptera, while in\r\n  other insects it is wanting.\r\n\r\n  =Proventricular valvule.=—Gehuchten also describes in Ptychoptera\r\n  what he calls “the proventricular valvule,” stating that it is “a\r\n  circular fold of the intestinal wall” (Fig. 310, _vpr_). He claims\r\n  that it has not before been found, the “proventricular beak” of\r\n  Schneider being regarded by him as the œsophageal valvule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 316.—Digestive canal of _Ptychoptera contaminata_: _gs_, salivary\r\n    glands; _ra_, œsophagus; _pr_, proventriculus; _gt_, crown of eight\r\n    small tubular glands; _im_, mid-intestine; _ga_, two accessory white\r\n    glands; _vm_, urinary vessels; _ig_, small intestine; _gi_, large\r\n    intestine; _r_, rectum; _A_, the proventriculus in which the hinder\r\n    end of the œsophagus extends as far as the chyle-stomach. _B_,\r\n    longitudinal section of the proventricular region; _sph_, muscular\r\n    ring or œsophageal sphincter; _ppr_, wall of the proventriculus;\r\n    _e_, circular constriction dividing the cavity of the proventriculus\r\n    in two; _vpr_, circular fold of the wall of the mid-intestine\r\n    forming the proventricular valve; _vœ_, œsophageal valve.—After\r\n    Gehuchten.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The peritrophic membrane.=—This membrane appears first to have been\r\nnoticed by Ramdohr in 1811 in _Hemerobius perla_. It has been found by\r\nSchneider, who calls it the “funnel.” On the hinder end of the\r\nfore-stomach, he says, the cuticula forms a fold enclosing the outlet of\r\nthe fore-stomach, and extending back like a tube to the anus. This\r\n“funnel,” he adds, occurs in a great number of insects. It has been\r\nfound in Thysanura, but is wanting in Hemiptera. In the Coleoptera it is\r\nabsent in Carabidæ and Dyticidæ. It is generally present in Diptera and\r\nin the larvæ of Lepidoptera, but not in the adults. In Hymenoptera it\r\nhas been found in ants and wasps, but is absent in Cynipidæ,\r\nIchneumonidæ, and Tenthredinidæ. All those insects (including their\r\nlarvæ) possessing this funnel eat solid, indigestible food, while those\r\nwhich do not possess it take fluid nourishment. It is elastic, and\r\nfirmly encloses the contents of the digestive tract. Until Schneider’s\r\ndiscovery of its general occurrence, it had only been known to exist in\r\nthe viviparous Cecidomyia larvæ (Miastor). Wagner, its discoverer,\r\nnoticed in the stomach of this insect a second tube which contained\r\nfood. Pagenstecher was inclined to regard the tube as a secretion of the\r\nsalivary glands. Metschnikoff, however, more correctly stated that the\r\ntube consisted of chitin, but he regarded it as adapted for the removal\r\nof the secretions. (Schneider.) Plateau, however, as well as Balbiani,\r\nthe latter calling it the “peritropic membrane,” considers this membrane\r\nas a secretion of the chylific stomach, and that it is formed at the\r\nsurface of the epithelial cells. It surrounds the food along the entire\r\ndigestive tract, forming an envelope around the fæcal masses. On the\r\nother hand, Gehuchten states that in the larva of Ptychoptera its mode\r\nof origin differs from that described by Plateau and by Schneider, and\r\nthat it is a product of secretion of special cells in the\r\nproventriculus.\r\n\r\n=The mid-intestine.=—This section of the digestive canal, often, though\r\nerroneously, called the “chylific stomach” or ventriculus, differs not\r\nonly in its embryonic history, but also in its structure and physiology\r\nfrom the fore and hind intestine of arthropods, and also presents no\r\nanalogy to the stomach of the vertebrate animals. In insects it is a\r\nsimple tube, not usually lined with chitin, since it is not formed by\r\nthe invagination of the ectoderm, as are the fore and hind intestine,\r\nthe absence of the chitinous intima promoting the absorption of soluble\r\nfood. Into the anterior end either open two or more large cœcal tubes\r\n(Fig. 299), or its whole outer surface is beset with very numerous fine\r\nglandular filaments like villi (Fig. 317 and Fig. 329).\r\n\r\nThe mid-intestine varies much in size and shape; it is very long in the\r\nlamellicorn beetles (Melolontha and Geotrupes), and while in Meloë it is\r\nvery large, occupying the greatest part of the body-cavity, in the\r\nlongicorn beetles and in Lepidoptera it is very small. The pyloric end\r\nconsists of an internal circular fold projecting into the cavity. In the\r\nPsocidæ (Cæcilius) the pyloric end is prolonged into a slender tube\r\nnearly as long as the larger anterior portion.\r\n\r\nThe limits between the mid and hind intestine are in some insects\r\ndifficult to define, the urinary tubes sometimes appearing to open into\r\nthe end of the mid-intestine (“stomach”). The latter also is sometimes\r\nlined with an intima. The limits are also determined by a circular\r\nprojection, directly behind which is an enlargement of the intestine in\r\nthe shape of a trench (_rigole_), or circular _cul-de-sac_ (the “pyloric\r\nvalvule” of some authors, including Beauregard), while the walls of the\r\nsmall intestine contract so as to produce a considerable constriction of\r\nthe cavity of the canal. This constriction exactly coincides with the\r\nbeginning of the double layer of circular muscles in the wall of the\r\nsmall intestine. An internal layer, which is the continuation of the\r\ncircular muscles of the chylific stomach, and an external layer much\r\nmore developed probably belong to this part of the alimentary canal.\r\nSince the homologue of the circular fold occurs in the locust as well as\r\nin Diptera, it is probably common to insects in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 317.—Digestive canal of _Carabus monilis_: _h_, œsophagus; _i_,\r\n    gizzard or proventriculus; _k_, “stomach,” with its cœca (_r_); _p_,\r\n    urinary tubes; _q_, their point of insertion; _m_, _n_, colon, with\r\n    cœcal glands; _s_, anal glands; _a_, _b_, _c_, a gastric cœcum; _a_,\r\n    _b_, portion of lining of gizzard.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 318.—Digestive canal of Meloe: _sch_, œsophagus; _Kl_, œsophageal\r\n    valve; _mD_, mid-intestine; _eD_, hind-intestine; _Ei_, eggs; _g_,\r\n    sexual opening.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Gehuchten adds that the limit set by the circular projection does\r\n  not exactly coincide with the opening into the intestine of the\r\n  urinary tubes and the two annexed glands. He shows by a section (his\r\n  Fig. 133) that the tubular glands open into the alimentary canal in\r\n  front of the circular fold. It is the same with the Malpighian\r\n  tubes. They are not, therefore, he claims, dependences of the\r\n  terminal intestine, but of the mid-intestine. Beauregard has\r\n  observed the same thing in the vesicating insects (Meloidæ). The\r\n  Malpighian tubes, he says, open into the “chylific stomach” before\r\n  the valvular crown. This arrangement does not seem to be general,\r\n  because, according to Balbiani, the Malpighian vessels open into the\r\n  beginning of the intestine in Cryptops. Compare also Minot’s account\r\n  of the valve in locusts separating the stomach from the intestine,\r\n  and in front of which the urinary or Malpighian tubes open.\r\n\r\n=Histology of the mid-intestine.=—The walls of the stomach are composed\r\nof an internal epithelium, a layer of connective tissue, with two\r\nmuscular layers, the inner of which is formed of unstriated circular\r\nmuscular fibres, and the outer of striated longitudinal muscular fibres.\r\n\r\nIn the cockroach short processes are given off from the free ends of the\r\nepithelial cells, as in the intestine of many mammals and other animals.\r\n“Between the cells a reticulum is often to be seen, especially where the\r\ncells have burst; it extends between and among all the elements of the\r\nmucous lining, and probably serves, like the very similar structure met\r\nwith in mammalian intestines, to absorb and conduct some of the products\r\nof digestion.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\nGehuchten shows that the epithelial lining of the mesenteron (chylific\r\nstomach) of the dipterous larva Ptychoptera is composed of two kinds of\r\ncells, _i.e._ secreting or glandular cells and absorbent cells, the\r\nformer situated at each end of the stomach, and the absorbent cells\r\noccupying the middle region. The part played by these cells in digestion\r\nwill be treated of beyond in the section on digestion. (See p. 327.)\r\n\r\n=The hind-intestine.=—In many insects this is divided into the ileum, or\r\nshort intestine, and the long intestine. The limit between the intestine\r\nand stomach is externally determined by the origin of the urinary tubes,\r\nwhich are outgrowths of the anterior end of the proctodæum. Like the\r\nfore-intestine the hind-intestine is lined with a thick muscular layer,\r\nand, as Gehuchten states, the passage from the epithelial lining of the\r\nstomach (mid-intestine) to the muscular lining of the intestine is\r\nabrupt.\r\n\r\n=Large intestine.=—In Ptychoptera, as described by Gehuchten, there are\r\nno precise limits between the small and large intestine; the epithelium\r\nof the large intestine has a special character, and its constituents\r\npresent a close resemblance to the absorbed cells of the chylific\r\nstomach, being like them large and polygonal. The muscular layer is not\r\ncontinuous, and is formed of longitudinal and circular fibres, the\r\nlatter being the larger.\r\n\r\n=The ileum=—Though in most insects slender, and therefore called the\r\nsmall intestine, the ileum is in locusts (Fig. 298) and grasshoppers\r\n(Anabrus, Fig. 299) as thick as the stomach. In many carnivorous beetles\r\n(Dyticus, Fig. 320, _il_, and Necrophorus) it is very long, but rather\r\nslender and short in the Carabidæ and Cicindelidæ, as well as those\r\ninsects whose food is liquid, such as Diptera. In the Lepidoptera it\r\nvaries in length, being in Sphinx quite long and bent into seven folds\r\n(Fig. 309), while it is very short in the Psocidæ, Chrysomelidæ, and\r\nTenthredinidæ.\r\n\r\nIn the locust the ileum is traversed by six longitudinal folds with\r\nintervening furrows; outside of each furrow is a longitudinal muscular\r\nband. Seen from the inner surface the epithelium has an unusual\r\ncharacter, the cells in the middle of each of the flat folds being quite\r\nlarge, polygonal in outline, while towards the furrows the cells become\r\nvery much smaller. The walls are double when seen in transverse section,\r\nthe inner layer consisting of epithelial cells resting on connective\r\ntissue, the outer layer formed of circular muscles. The cuticula is\r\nthin, but probably chitinous; it resembles that on the gastro-ileal\r\nfolds, except that there are no spinules, but unlike the cuticula of the\r\nstomach it extends equally over the folds and the furrows. (Minot.) In\r\nthe cockroach the junction of the small intestine with the colon is\r\nabrupt, a well-developed annular fold assuming the nature of a circular\r\nvalve. (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n=The gastro-ileal folds.=—In the locust the intestine is separated from\r\nthe chylific stomach by what Minot calls “the gastro-ileal folds,” which\r\nform a peculiar valve. The urinary vessels open just underneath and in\r\nfront of this valve. In Melanoplus, and probably in the entire family of\r\nAcrydiidæ, they are indicated as “dark spots, round in front and lying\r\nat the anterior end of the ileum so as to form a ring around the\r\ninterior of the intestine.” They are 12 in number, and all alike. They\r\nare pigmented and round in front where they are broadest and stand up\r\nhighest; they narrow down backwards, the pigment disappears, and they\r\ngradually fade out into the ileal folds. Directly beneath them, and just\r\nat the posterior end of the stomach, there is a strong band of circular\r\nstriated muscular fibres. The epithelium of these folds is covered with\r\nminute conical spines, which are generally, but not always, wanting\r\nbetween the folds. (Minot.)\r\n\r\n=The colon.=—This section of the intestine (Fig. 319) is sometimes\r\nregarded as a part of the rectum. In the locust the six longitudinal\r\nfolds of the ileum are continued into the colon, but their surface,\r\ninstead of being smooth as in the ileum, is thrown up into numerous\r\nirregular curved and zigzag secondary folds. The cells of the epithelium\r\nare of uniform size, and the layer is covered by a highly refringent\r\ncuticula without spines; and, like that in the ileum, it rests on a\r\nlayer of connective tissue, beyond which follows (1) an internal coat of\r\nlongitudinal, and (2) an external coat of circular striated muscular\r\nfibres. (Minot.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319.—Digestive canal of _Lucanus cervus_: _G_, anterior muscles\r\n    of the pharynx; _H_, œsophagus; _I_, gizzard; _K_, chyle-stomach;\r\n    _L_, ilium; _M_, colon (cœcal part of); _N_, colon; _O_, rectum;\r\n    _a_, frontal ganglion of the vagus; _b_, vagus nerve; _c_, anterior\r\n    lateral ganglion connected with the vagus.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn butterflies (_Pontia brassicæ_), in _Sphinx ligustri_, and probably\r\nin most Lepidoptera the colon is distinct from the rectum, and is\r\nanteriorly developed into a very large more or less pyriform or\r\nbladder-like cæcum (Figs. 309, 310), which in certain Coleoptera\r\n(Dyticus, Fig. 320, _d_; Silpha, Necrophorus, etc.) is of remarkable\r\nlength and shape; it also occurs in Nepidæ (Fig. 327). In the cockroach\r\na lateral cæcum “is occasionally, but not constantly, present towards\r\nits rectal end,” and a constriction divides the colon from the rectum.\r\n(Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n=The rectum.=—The terminal section of the hind-gut varies in length and\r\nsize, but is usually larger than the colon, and with thick, muscular\r\nwalls. In Lepidoptera it is narrow and short.\r\n\r\nThe rectum is remarkable for containing structures called rectal glands\r\n(Fig. 298). Chun describes those of _Locusta viridissima_ as six flat\r\nfolds, formed by a high columnar epithelium and a distinct cuticula;\r\nthere is a coat of circular bands corresponding to the furrows between\r\nthe glands. Minot states that this description is applicable to the\r\nlocusts (Acrydiidæ) he has investigated, the only difference being in\r\nthe structural details of the single layers. He claims that the rectal\r\nfolds “do not offer the least appearance of glandular structure,”\r\nneither is their function an absorbent one, as Chun supposed. From their\r\nstructure and position Fernald regards the rectal glands of Passalus as\r\nacting like a valve, serving to retain the food in the absorptive\r\nportions of the digestive tract till all nutriment is extracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 320.—_Dyticus marginalis_, ♂ opened from the back: _a_, crop;\r\n    _b_, proventriculus; _c_, mid-intestine beset with fine cœcal\r\n    glands; _d_, long cœcal appendage of the colon; apodemes;\r\n    _B_{1}_-_B_{3}_, apodemes; _vhm_, coxal extensor muscle, moving the\r\n    hind leg; _ho_, testis; _dr_, accessory gland; _r_, penis; _e_,\r\n    reservoir of the secretion of the anal gland.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe epithelial folds of the larvæ of dragon-flies serve as organs of\r\nrespiration, the water being admitted into this cavity, and when\r\nforcibly expelled serving to propel the creature forward. Paired and\r\nsingle anal glands (repugnatorial) enter the rectum of certain\r\nColeoptera (Figs. 302, _l_; 317, _s_; 320, _e_).\r\n\r\n=The vent (anus).=—The external opening of the rectum is situated in the\r\nend of the body, in the vestigial 10th or 11th abdominal segment, and is\r\nmore or less eversible. It is protected above in caterpillars, and other\r\ninsects with 10 free abdominal segments, by the suranal plate. It is\r\nbounded on the sides by the paranal lobes, while beneath is the\r\ninfra-anal lobe.\r\n\r\nThe anus is wanting in certain insects, and where this is the case the\r\nhind-gut, owing to a retention of the embryonic condition, is usually\r\nseparated from the mid-intestine. (See p. 300.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 321.—Enteric canal of _Psyllopsis fraxinicola_: _œ_, œsophagus;\r\n    _md_, mid-intestine; _ed_, hind-intestine; _vm_, urinary vessels;\r\n    _s_, the coil formed by the hind-intestine and the most anterior\r\n    part of the mid-intestine.—After Witlaczil, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Some remarkable features of the digestive canal in hemipterous\r\n  insects are noteworthy. In the Coccidæ, according to Mark, the\r\n  anterior end of the long mid-intestine forms, with the hinder end of\r\n  the œsophagus, a small loop, whose posterior end is firmly grown to\r\n  the wall of the rectum, and forms a cup-like invagination of the\r\n  latter. Then the rest of the tube-like stomach turns sidewise and\r\n  forms a large loop, which turns back on itself and occupies a large\r\n  part of the body-cavity. This loop receives on the anterior end,\r\n  near the œsophagus, the two urinary vessels, and forms just below\r\n  the opening into the rectum a short cæcum.\r\n\r\n  In other homopterous genera (Psyllidæ and some Cicadidæ) Witlaczil\r\n  describes nearly the same peculiarity, the mid-gut and part of the\r\n  intestine forming a loop growing together for a certain distance and\r\n  winding round each other (Fig. 321).\r\n\r\n=Histology of the digestive canal.=—In all the divisions of the\r\ndigestive canal of insects the succession of the cellular layers\r\ncomposing it is the same: 1st, a cuticula; 2d, an epithelium; 3d,\r\nconnective tissue; 4th, muscular tissue. In the locust, the first\r\ndivision of the canal (fore-gut), there are two muscular coats, an\r\ninternal longitudinal and an external circular coat; the fibres are all\r\nstriated. The lining epithelium is not much developed, but forms a\r\nthick, hard, and refringent cuticula, which is thrown up into spiny\r\nridges. In the second division (mid-gut, “stomach”) the epithelium is\r\ncomposed of very high columnar cells, which make up the greater part of\r\nthe thickness of the walls, while the cuticula is very delicate,\r\nslightly refringent, with no ridges, and is probably not chitinous; the\r\nfibres of the muscular coats are not striated, while this division is\r\nalso distinguished by the presence of glandular follicles and folds. The\r\nstomach and the cæcal appendages have all these peculiarities in common,\r\nwhile no other part of the canal is thus characterized.\r\n\r\nThe third division (intestine and rectum) is composed of an epithelium,\r\nthe cells of which are intermediate in size between those of the fore\r\nand mid gut. The cells are often pigmented, and they are covered by a\r\nmuch thicker cuticula than that of the stomach, but which is not so\r\nthick and hard as that of the œsophagus and proventriculus. The very\r\nrefringent cuticula is not thrown up into ridges, though in some parts\r\nit is covered with delicate conical spines, which are very short. “The\r\nepithelium and underlying connective tissue (_tunica propria_) are\r\nthrown up into six folds, which run longitudinally, being regular in the\r\nileum and rectum (as the rectal glands), but very irregular in the\r\ncolon. Outside the depression between each two neighboring folds there\r\nis a longitudinal muscular band, these making six bands. This peculiar\r\ndisposition of the longitudinal muscles does not occur in any other part\r\nof the canal; it is, therefore, especially characteristic of the third\r\ndivision.” (Minot.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LITERATURE ON THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Treviranus, G.

Digestion in insects\r\n\r\nFor the most complete and reliable investigation of the process of\r\ndigestion, we are indebted to Plateau, whose results we give, besides\r\nthe conclusions of later authors:\r\n\r\nIn mandibulate or biting insects, the food is conducted through the\r\nœsophagus by means of the muscular coating of this part of the digestive\r\ncanal. Suctorial insects draw in their liquid food by the contractions\r\nfollowed by the dilatations of the mid-intestine (chylific stomach).\r\nDragon-flies, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera swallow some air with their\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nWhere the salivary glands are present, the neutral alkaline fluid\r\nsecreted by them has the same property as the salivary fluid of\r\nvertebrates of rapidly transforming starchy foods into soluble and\r\nassimilable glucose. In such forms as have no salivary glands, their\r\nplace is almost always supplied by an epithelial lining of the\r\nœsophagus, or, as in the Hydrophilidæ, a fluid is secreted which has the\r\nsame function as the true salivary fluid.\r\n\r\nNagel states that the saliva of the larva of Dyticus is powerfully\r\ndigestive, and has a marked poisonous action, killing other insects, and\r\neven tadpoles of twice the size of the attacking larva, very rapidly.\r\nThe larvæ not only suck the blood of their victims, but absorb the\r\nproteid substances. Drops of salivary juice seem to paralyze the victim,\r\nand to ferment the proteids. The secretion is neutral, the digestion\r\ntryptic. Similar extra-oral digestion seems to occur in larvæ of\r\nant-lions, etc. (Biol. Centralbl., xvi, 1896, pp. 51–57, 103–112; Journ.\r\nRoy. Micr. Soc., 1896, p. 184.)\r\n\r\nIn carnivorous insects and in Orthoptera, the œsophagus dilates into a\r\ncrop (ingluvies) ended by a narrow, valvular apparatus (or gizzard of\r\nauthors). The food, more or less divided by the jaws, accumulates in the\r\ncrop, which is very distensible; and, when the food is penetrated by the\r\nneutral or alkaline liquid, there undergoes an evident digestive action\r\nresulting, in carnivorous insects, in the transformation of albuminoid\r\nsubstances into soluble and assimilable matter analogous to peptones,\r\nand, in herbivorous insects, an abundant production of sugar from\r\nstarch. This digestion in the crop, a food-reservoir, is very slow, and,\r\nuntil it is ended, the rest of the digestive canal remains empty.\r\n\r\n“Any decided acidity found in the crop is due to the injection of acid\r\nfood; but a very faint acidity may occur, which results from the\r\npresence in the crop of a fluid secreted by the cæcal diverticula of the\r\nmesenteron.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\nWhen digestion in the crop is accomplished, the matters are subjected to\r\nan energetic pressure of the walls through peristaltic contractions, and\r\nthen, guided by the furrows and chitinous teeth, pass along or gradually\r\nfilter through the valvular apparatus or proventriculus, whose function\r\nis that of a strainer.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the “chyle-stomach” (mesenteron) of Orthoptera are\r\nglandular cæca which secrete a feebly acid fluid. This fluid emulsifies\r\nfats, and converts albuminoids into peptones. It passes forwards into\r\nthe crop, and there acts upon the food.\r\n\r\nIn the mesenteron (mid-intestine) the food is acted upon by an alkaline\r\nor neutral fluid, never acid, either secreted, as in Orthoptera, by\r\nlocal special glands, or by a multitude of minute glandular cæca, as in\r\nmany Coleoptera, or by a simple epithelial layer. It has no analogy with\r\nthe gastric juices of vertebrates; its function differs in insects of\r\ndifferent groups; in carnivorous Coleoptera it actively emulsionizes\r\ngreasy matters; in the Hydrophilidæ it continues the process of\r\ntransformation of starch into glucose, begun in the œsophagus. In the\r\nScarabæidæ, it also produces glucose, but this action is local, not\r\noccurring elsewhere; in caterpillars, it causes a production of glucose,\r\nand transforms the albuminoids into soluble and assimilable bodies\r\nanalogous to peptones, and also emulsionizes greasy matters. Finally, in\r\nthe herbivorous Orthoptera there does not seem to be any formation of\r\nsugar in the stomach itself, the production of glucose being confined to\r\nthe crop (jabot).\r\n\r\nWhen digestion in the crop is finished, the proventriculus relaxes, and\r\nthe contents of the crop, now in a semi-fluid condition, guided by the\r\nfurrows and teeth, passes into the mesenteron, which is without a\r\nchitinous lining, and is thus fitted for absorption.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the mid-intestine (chylific stomach) then slowly and\r\ngradually pass into the intestine, the first anterior portion of which,\r\nusually long and slender, is the seat of an active absorption. The\r\nepithelial lining observed in certain insects seems, however, to\r\nindicate that secondary digestion takes place in this section. The\r\nreaction of the contents is neutral or alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe second and larger division of the intestine only acts as a stercoral\r\nreservoir. (The voluminous cæcum occurring in Dyticidæ, Nepa, and\r\nRanatra, whether full or empty, never contains gas, and it is not, as\r\nsome have supposed, a swimming-bladder.) The liquid product secreted by\r\nthe Malpighian tubes accumulates in this division, and, under certain\r\ncircumstances, very large calculi are often formed. In his subsequent\r\npaper on the digestion of the cockroach, Plateau states that in the\r\nintestine are united the residue of the work of digestion and the\r\nsecretion of the urinary or Malpighian tubes, this secretion being\r\npurely urinary.\r\n\r\nThese organs are exclusively depuratory and urinary, freeing the body\r\nfrom waste products of the organic elements. The liquid they secrete\r\ncontains urea (?), uric acid and abundant urates, hippuric acid (?),\r\nchloride of sodium, phosphates, carbonate of lime, oxalate of lime in\r\nquantity, leucine, and coloring-matters.\r\n\r\nThe products of the rectal or anal glands vary much in different groups,\r\nbut they take no part in digestion, nor are they depuratory in their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nInsects have nothing resembling chylific substances.[51] The products of\r\ndigestion, dissolved salts, peptones, sugar in solution, emulsionized\r\ngreasy matters, pass through the relatively delicate walls of the\r\ndigestive canal by osmose, and mingle outside of the canal with the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nWhatever substances remain undigested are expelled with the excrements;\r\nsuch are the chitin of the integuments of insects, vegetable cellulose,\r\nand chlorophyll, which is detected by the microspectroscope all along\r\nthe digestive canal of phytophagous insects.\r\n\r\nIn his experiments in feeding the larvæ of Musca with lacmus, Kowalevsky\r\nfound that the œsophagus, food-reservoir, and proventriculus, with its\r\ncæcal appendages, always remained blue, and had an alkaline reaction;\r\nthe mid-intestine, also, in its anterior portion, remained blue, but a\r\nportion of its posterior half became deep red, and also exhibited a\r\nstrong reaction. The hind-intestine, however, always remained blue, and\r\nalso had an alkaline reaction. (Biol. Centralbl., ix, 1889, p. 46.)\r\n\r\n=The mechanism of secretion.=—Gehuchten describes the process of\r\nsecretion in insects, the following extract being taken from his\r\nresearches on the digestive apparatus of the larva of Ptychoptera. The\r\nproducts of secretion poured into the alimentary canal are more or less\r\nfluid; for this reason, it is impossible to say when an epithelial cell\r\nat rest contains these products. For the secreting nature of these cells\r\nis only apparent at the moment when they are ready for excretion; then\r\nthe cellular membrane swells out, and a part of the protoplasmic body\r\nprojects into the intestinal cavity.\r\n\r\nBefore going farther, the terms _secretion_ and _excretion_ should, he\r\nsays, be defined. With Ranvier, he believes that the elaboration in the\r\nprotoplasm of a definite fluid substance is, _par excellence_, the\r\nsecretory act, while the removal of this substance is the act of\r\nexcretion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 322.—Different phases of the mechanism of secretion and of\r\n    excretion.—After Gehuchten.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA glandular cell of the chylific stomach, when at rest, is always\r\nfurnished with a striated “platform,” or flat surface, or face, on the\r\nside facing the cavity of the stomach, and the free edge of the\r\nplatform, or plateau, is provided with filaments projecting into the\r\ndigestive cavity (Fig. 322, _f_). These glandular cells, when active,\r\ndiffer much in appearance. In a great number, the platform (plateau) has\r\ndisappeared, and is replaced by a simple, regular membrane. During the\r\nprocess of secretion, a finely granular mass, in direct continuity with\r\nthe protoplasm, swells, and raises the membrane over the entire breadth\r\nof the cell, causing it to project into the intestinal cavity (Fig. 322,\r\n_A_, _B_). These vesicles, or drops of the secretion, whether free or\r\nstill attached by a web to the cells, are clear and transparent in the\r\nliving insect, but granular in the portions of the digestive canal fixed\r\nfor cutting into sections. Gehuchten then asks: “How does a cell gorged\r\nwith the products of secretion empty itself?” Both Ranvier and also\r\nHeidenhain believe that one and the same glandular cell may secrete and\r\nexcrete several times without undergoing destruction, but their\r\nresearches made on salivary glands have not answered the question.\r\nGehuchten explains the process thus: when the epithelial cell begins to\r\nsecrete, the clear fluid elaborated in the protoplasm of the cell\r\nincreases the intracellular tension, until, finally, the fluid breaks\r\nthrough certain weak places in the swollen basal membrane of the\r\nplatform, and then easily passes through the closely crowded filaments,\r\nand projects out into the intestinal cavity as a pear-shaped vesicle of\r\na liquid rich in albumens at first attached to the free face of the\r\ncell, but finally becoming free, as at Fig. 322, _A_, _B_.\r\n\r\nWhen the elaboration of the substance to be secreted is more active, the\r\nmechanism of the secretion is modified. The basal membrane of the\r\nplatform may then be raised at several places at once; instead of a\r\nsingle vesicle projecting into the intestinal cavity, each cell may\r\npresent a great number more or less voluminous. If all remain small and\r\nrapidly detach themselves from the glandular cell, the filaments of the\r\nplatform are simply separated from each other at different points of the\r\nfree face, as in Fig. 322, _C_. On the other hand, when the different\r\nvesicles of a single cell become larger, the filaments of the platform\r\nare compressed and crowded against each other in the spaces between the\r\nvesicles remaining free, and the undisturbed portions of the platform\r\nappear homogeneous (Fig. 322, _D_). After the excretion of the secretory\r\nproducts by this process of strangulation, the cell then assumes the\r\naspect of a glandular cell at rest, and may begin again to form a new\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: The process of excretion may occur in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Where the membrane ruptures and the substances secreted are sent\r\ndirectly out into the digestive cavity. 2. Where the vesicles become\r\nfree by strangulation, floating in the glandular or intestinal cavity,\r\nand ending by rupturing and coming into contact with the neighboring\r\nvesicles or with the food.\r\n\r\n=Absorbent cells.=—Besides the glandular or secreting cells in\r\nPtychoptera, there is between the two regions of the chyle-stomach lined\r\nwith these cells a region about a centimetre long composed of absorbent\r\ncells. The absorbent cells are very large, polygonal, and contain a\r\nlarge nucleus, in which is a striated convoluted chromatic cord.\r\n\r\nThe food on entering the chyle-stomach is brought into contact with the\r\nproducts secreted in the proventriculus, in the first part of the\r\nchyle-stomach, and in the tubular glands. These products of secretion\r\nact on the food, extracting from them useful substances which they\r\nrender soluble. These substances, after having been absorbed by the\r\nabsorbent cells in the middle region of the stomach, undergo special\r\nmodifications, and are transformed into solid products, which are\r\nsituated at the bottom of these cells. Afterwards the alimentary\r\nsubstances freed from a portion of their useful substances are again\r\nplaced in contact with the products of secretion in the distal part of\r\nthe chylific ventricle, and reach the terminal part of the intestine.\r\n\r\n“The products of secretion,” adds Gehuchten, “diverted into the\r\nintestinal canal do not come into immediate contact with the alimentary\r\nsubstances; they are separated from it by a continuous, structureless,\r\nquite thick membrane (the peritrophic membrane), which directly envelops\r\nthe cylinder of food matters, extending from the orifice of the\r\nœsophageal valvule to the end of the intestine. Between this membrane\r\nand the free face of the epithelial lining there exists a circular\r\nspace, into which are thrown and accumulate the excreted substances. The\r\nlatter then cannot directly mingle with the aliments; but when they are\r\nliquid they undoubtedly pass through this membrane by osmose, and thus\r\ncome into contact with the nutritive substances. It is the same with the\r\nproducts of absorption. The absorption of soluble products of the\r\nintestinal cavity is not then so simple a phenomenon as it was at first\r\nthought to be, since these products are nowhere brought into immediate\r\ncontact with the absorbent cells” (pp. 90, 91).\r\n\r\nThe most recent authority, Cuénot, states that absorption of the\r\nproducts of digestion takes place entirely in the mid-intestine, and in\r\nits cæca when these are present. The mid-intestine exercises a selective\r\naction on the constituents of the food comparable to the action of the\r\nvertebrate liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               LITERATURE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Davy, J.= Note on the excrements of certain insects, and on the\r\n    urinary excrement of insects.

In the cockroach a large salivary gland\r\nand accompanying reservoir lie on each side of the œsophagus and crop.\r\nThe gland is a thin, leaf-like, lobulated mass, divided into two\r\nprincipal lobes. These open into a common trunk, which after receiving a\r\nbranch from a small accessory lobe, and from the salivary reservoir,\r\nunites with its fellow to form the unpaired salivary duct which opens\r\ninto the under side of the lingua. Each salivary reservoir is a large\r\noval sac with transparent walls. (Miall and Denny, also Figs. 299, _sr_,\r\nand 327.) The ducts and reservoirs have a chitinous lining, and the\r\nducts are, like the tracheæ, surrounded by a so-called spiral thread, or\r\nby separate, incomplete, hooplike bands, which serve to keep the duct\r\npermanently distended. In the locust (Fig. 298) the lobules are more\r\nscattered, forming small separate groups of acinose glands. In the\r\nembryo of Forficula Heymons has observed a pair of salivary glands\r\nopening on the inner angle of the mandibles, a second pair opening in\r\nthe second maxillæ, while a third pair of glands, whose function is\r\ndoubtful, is situated in the hinder part of the head, opening to the\r\nright and left on the chitinous plate (postgula) behind the submentum.\r\nIn Perla, there are two pairs segmentally arranged (Fig. 343).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 323.—Left side of the head of the silkworm: _a_, adductor muscle\r\n    of the mandible, from which the muscular fibres have been removed;\r\n    _b_, upper fibres of the same; _c_, lower fibres cut away to show\r\n    the adductor muscle (_e_); _d_, fibres inserted on the accessory\r\n    adductor lamella; _f_, œsophagus, much swollen; _g_, salivary gland;\r\n    _h_, dorsal vessel; _i_, _l_, tracheæ of the mandibular muscles;\r\n    _k_, trachea; _n_, optic nerve.—After Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 324.—Lower side of the head of the silkworm exposed, the spinning\r\n    apparatus, the œsophageal ganglion, and the adductor of the left\r\n    mandible removed: _M_, mandible; _P_, abductor of the mandible; _R_,\r\n    adductor; _N_, salivary gland attached at _O_ to the edge of the\r\n    adductor muscle; _o_, _o_, transverse portion of the “hyoid”; 3,\r\n    masticator nerve and its recurrent branch (7); _L_, tongue cut\r\n    horizontally.—After Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere we might refer to a pair of glands regarded by Blanc as the true\r\nsalivary glands. They do not appear to be the homologues of the salivary\r\nglands of other insects, though probably functioning as such. The\r\nfunctional salivary glands of lepidopterous larvæ have been overlooked\r\nby most entomotomists, and the spinning glands have been, it seems to\r\nus, correctly supposed to be modified salivary glands. Lucas also\r\nregards those of case-worms (Trichoptera) as morphologically salivary\r\nglands. Those of the silkworm were figured by Réaumur (Tom. i, Pl. v,\r\nFig. 1), but not described; while those of Cossus, which are voluminous,\r\nwere regarded by Lyonet as “_vaisseaux dissolvans_.” Dr. Auzoux (1849),\r\nin his celebrated model of the silkworm, represented them accurately,\r\nwhile Cornalia briefly described them as opening into the mouth. The\r\nfirst satisfactory description is that of Blanc (1891), who states that\r\nin the silkworm “the two salivary glands” are small, flexuous, yellow\r\ntubes, which occupy a variable position on the sides of the œsophagus\r\n(Fig. 323). The glandular portion passes into the head, ending at the\r\nlevel of the adductor plate of the mandibles (Fig. 324, _o_), and\r\nentering the buccal cavity at the base of the mandible, as seen in Fig.\r\n323. It is plain, when we recognize the direct homology of the\r\nsilk-glands of the caterpillars with the salivary glands of other\r\ninsects, and of the spinneret with the hypopharynx, that these so-called\r\n“salivary glands” in lepidopterous larvæ are different structures. They\r\nare probably modified coxal glands, belonging to the mandibular segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 325.—One of the two salivary glands of _Cæcilius burmeisteri_:\r\n    _d_, excretory duct; _cn_, the lumen or canal; _cg_, gland-cells;\r\n    _ct_, salivary fluid.—After Kolbe.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The polygonal epithelial cells of these glands contain branched\r\n  nuclei, recalling those of the spinning-glands. In those\r\n  caterpillars which feed on leaves, the salivary glands are slightly\r\n  developed, but in such as bore into and eat wood, as the Cossidæ,\r\n  the glands are, as figured by Lyonet, very large, forming two\r\n  sausage-shaped bodies passing back to the beginning of the\r\n  mid-intestine, each ending in a long convoluted filament. The\r\n  salivary glands of the imago are very long and convoluted (Fig. 310,\r\n  _sd_).\r\n\r\n  In the Panorpidæ these glands differ in the sexes, the males having\r\n  three pairs of very long tortuous tubes, while, in the females, they\r\n  are reduced to two indistinct vesicles. (Siebold.)\r\n\r\nIn the Diptera in general there are two pairs, one situated in the beak,\r\nthe other in the thorax. In the larvæ there is a single pair (Fig. 341).\r\nKraepelin describes a third pair in the Muscidæ at the point of\r\ntransition from the fulcrum to the œsophagus, but Knüppel has apparently\r\nfound only what may be fat cells at this point, so that the supposed\r\npresence of a third pair in Diptera needs confirmation. In the Psocidæ\r\nthere are two salivary glands, of simple tubular shape (Fig. 325).\r\n\r\nIn the Nepidæ the salivary glands are four in number, and of\r\nconglomerate structure, two being long and extending back into the\r\nbeginning of the abdomen, while the other two are about one-fourth as\r\nlong. (Figs. 327, 328.) In Cicada, besides a pair of simple tortuous\r\ntubes, there is in the head another pair of glands, each composed of two\r\ntufts of short lobes, situated one behind the other. (Dufour.) In many\r\nHemiptera (Pyrrhocoris, Capsus, etc.) there is but a single pair, each\r\ngland consisting of four lobes; in the Coccidæ each gland is divided\r\ninto two lobes (Fig. 326); in the Aphidæ, according to Witlaczil, they\r\nconsist of two lobes grown together. In the Psyllidæ they are said to be\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nIn _Phylloxera vastatrix_ the saliva is forced through a salivary\r\npassage out of the duct and into the mouth by a pumping apparatus\r\nfurnished with special muscles. (Krassilstschik.)\r\n\r\nIn the Odonata acinose glands are present in the imago, but not in the\r\nnymph until in its last stage, Poletaiew accounting for their absence in\r\nthe earlier stages by the fact that the larva swallows more or less\r\nwater while taking its food.\r\n\r\nIn the Coleoptera, as we have observed in Anopthalmus, there are three\r\npairs of salivary glands (Fig. 74). In the Blapsidæ these glands consist\r\nof many ramifying tubes united on each side of the œsophagus into a\r\nsingle duct; in others they are but slightly developed, while in still\r\nothers they are wanting.\r\n\r\nThe salivary glands are most highly differentiated in the Hymenoptera,\r\nand especially in the bees (Bombus and Apis), where Schiemenz found not\r\nless than five systems of glands (Fig. 329; also 87), of which four\r\nsystems are paired. One pair of these glands lies in the tongue, three\r\nin the head, and one in the thorax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 326.—Acinous salivary glands of _Orthezia cataphracta_. In some\r\n    acini the nuclei and boundaries of the cells are shown.—After List,\r\n    from Field’s Hertwig.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  System I is situated in the head, and consists of unicellular\r\n  glands; the duct from each cell leads into a common, strongly\r\n  chitinized duct, opening into the gullet.\r\n\r\n  System II, composed of acinose glands, lies also in the head; its\r\n  duct is united with that of System III, situated in the thorax.\r\n  (Fig. 329, 2, 3.)\r\n\r\n  System IV is situated at the base of the upper surface of the\r\n  mandibles, and forms a delicate sac lined within with glandular\r\n  cells; its duct opens at the insertion of the mandibles.\r\n\r\n  System V lies in the beak, and is a single gland consisting of\r\n  unicellular glands; it opens into the common opening of Systems II\r\n  and III. This system is wanting in the honey-bee, but occurs in\r\n  Bombus and other genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 327.—Appendages of digestive canal of Belostoma.—After Locy.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 328.—Salivary and other glands of Ranatra.—After Locy.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In all the five systems there constantly occur three cellular\r\n  layers: the intima, epithelial, and propria. As regards their origin\r\n  Schiemenz states that Systems I and IV are new structures, that\r\n  System III arises in part, and Systems II and V wholly, from the\r\n  silk-glands of the larva. As the glands differ much in the sexes,\r\n  and in different species and genera, Schiemenz believes that their\r\n  function is very manifold.\r\n\r\n  In addition to those previously discovered by Schiementz, Bordas has\r\n  detected two additional pairs of salivary glands in the worker and\r\n  male honey-bee, _i.e._ the internal mandibular and sublingual\r\n  glands, so that in Apis there are in all six pairs, and apparently\r\n  one unpaired.\r\n\r\nThe delicate chitinous external layer of the gland is perforated by many\r\nvery fine pores through which the salivary fluid secreted by the\r\nepithelial cells passes into the salivary duct. The glands are\r\nexternally bathed by the blood.\r\n\r\nIn many insects, including lepidopterous larvæ, the single median\r\nopening of the salivary duct is converted into a spraying apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the adult Lepidoptera, according to Kirbach:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 329.—Salivary glands of the honey-bee: systems No. 1–3, × 15:\r\n    _sv_, salivary valve (of systems 2 and 3) at base of tongue; _lp_,\r\n    labial palpus; _mx_, maxilla; _so_, salivary opening of system 1 in\r\n    hypopharyngeal plate; _no_, openings in plate for termination of\r\n    taste-nerve; _œ_, œsophagus; _sd_, salivary duct; _b_, junction of\r\n    ducts of system No. 2; _c_, junction of ducts of system No. 3; _sc_,\r\n    _sc_, salivary sacs; _fl_, front lobe; _bl_, back lobe; _a_,\r\n    chitinous duct, with spiral thread. _B_, single acinus of system No.\r\n    1, × 70: _n_, nucleus; _st_, salivary tract; _d_, large duct. _C_,\r\n    single pouch, or acinus, from system No. 2: _a_, propria or outer\r\n    membrane; _sc_, secreting cells. _D_, termination of system No.\r\n    3:_{1},_{2},_{3},_{4}, lines marking end of section; _d_, duct in\r\n    section; _sc_, secreting cells in section; _n_, nucleus.—After\r\n    Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Its lower half forms a thick chitinous gutter, with a concave cover\r\n  above, in which the similarly shaped upper half lies encased, so\r\n  that between the two only a small semicircular opening remains.\r\n  Powerful muscles extend from the cover to the lower side and to the\r\n  two ridges of the bottom plate; through their contraction the upper\r\n  channel is elevated, and presses out of the hinder part of the ducts\r\n  into the space thus formed a great quantity of the saliva, which by\r\n  allowing the contraction of the cover-muscle through the\r\n  crevice-like opening, which is situated in the lower edge of the\r\n  mouth-opening, becomes squeezed out in order either to mix with the\r\n  fluid where the 2d maxillæ fuse, passing up into the canal in the\r\n  proboscis, or to penetrate into and thus dilute the semi-fluid or\r\n  solid substances taken, into the proboscis.”\r\n\r\n  The morphology and general relations of the salivary glands have\r\n  been sketched out by Hatschek, Patten, and by Lucas, from\r\n  observations on those of the case-worms or larval Trichoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 330.—Eight pairs of glands of Andrena: I, thoracic; II,\r\n    postcerebral; III, supracerebral; IV, lateropharyngeal; V,\r\n    mandibular; VI, internomandibular; VII, sublingual; VIII, lingual;\r\n    _Md_, mandible; _L_, tongue; _o_, eye; _œ_, œsophagus; _J_,\r\n    honey-sac.—After Bordas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Patten states that the spinning-glands in Neophylax are formed by a\r\n  pair of ectodermal invaginations on the ventral side of the embryo,\r\n  between the base of the 2d maxillæ and the nervous cord. They\r\n  increase rapidly in length, and “they also unite to form a common\r\n  duct, which opens at the end of the upper lip.”\r\n\r\n  The salivary glands in the same insect are “formed by invagination\r\n  of the ectoderm on the inner sides of the mandibles, in the same\r\n  manner as are the spinning glands.”\r\n\r\n  Lucas has shown that in trichopterous larvæ (Anabolia) there are\r\n  three pairs of salivary glands in the head, which are serially\r\n  arranged. The first pair belong to the mandibular, the second pair\r\n  to the 1st maxillary, and the third pair, or spinning glands, to the\r\n  2d maxillary segment. The first or mandibular glands open into the\r\n  mouth at the base of the mandibles directly behind the dorsal\r\n  condyle. The second pair open between the 1st and 2d maxillæ; at the\r\n  base of the latter, near the ventral condyle of the mandibles. The\r\n  third pair open into the hypopharynx, which is modified to form the\r\n  spinneret. Lucas agrees with Korschelt in regarding them as modified\r\n  coxal glands, Schiemenz having previously regarded the headglands of\r\n  the imago of the bee as belonging to the segments bearing the three\r\n  pairs of buccal appendages, so that each segment originally\r\n  contained a pair of glands. It is thus proven that the silk-glands\r\n  are modified salivary glands adapted to the needs of spinning larvæ,\r\n  and indeed in the imago the sericteries revert to their primitive\r\n  shape and use as salivary glands.\r\n\r\n  The serial arrangement of the salivary glands in the Hymenoptera,\r\n  where the number varies from five to ten pairs, is clearly proved by\r\n  Bordas. He has detected five more pairs than were previously known,\r\n  and names the whole series as follows:—1, the thoracic salivary\r\n  glands, which are larger than the others, and nine other pairs,\r\n  which are all contained in the head as follows: 2, postcerebral; 3,\r\n  supracerebral; 4, lateropharyngeal; 5, mandibular; 6,\r\n  internomandibular, situated on the inner side of the base of\r\n  mandible; 7, sublingual; 8, lingual (these and 1 to 7 common to all\r\n  Hymenoptera); 9, paraglossal (in Vespidæ); 10, maxillary (very\r\n  distinct in most wasps). These glands do not all occur in the same\r\n  species, being more or less atrophied.\r\n\r\n  Bordas further shows the segmental arrangement of the cephalic\r\n  glands by stating that the supracerebral glands correspond to the\r\n  antennal segment, the sublingual glands to the labial, the\r\n  mandibular glands (external and internal) to the mandibular segment,\r\n  the maxillary glands to the 1st maxillary segment, the lingual\r\n  glands to the 2d maxillary segment, while the thoracic and\r\n  postcerebral salivary glands, he thinks, correspond to the ocular\r\n  segment, a view with which we are indisposed to agree, although\r\n  conceding that each of the six segments of the head has in it at\r\n  least one pair of salivary glands.\r\n\r\n  =Functions of the different salivary glands in Hymenoptera.=—The\r\n  secretion of the thoracic glands is feebly alkaline. The\r\n  postcerebral salivary glands, considered by Ramdohr to be organs of\r\n  smell, secrete, like the preceding, a distinctively alkaline fluid,\r\n  which mingles with the products of the thoracic glands. The\r\n  supracerebral glands, also equally well developed in all\r\n  Hymenoptera, though much atrophied in the females and especially the\r\n  males of _Apis mellifica_, also in the Vespinæ and Polistinæ,\r\n  secrete an abundant, feebly acid liquid, which is actively concerned\r\n  in digestion.\r\n\r\n  As to the mandibular glands, which Wolf supposed to be olfactory\r\n  organs, their acid secretion, though smelling strongly, acts\r\n  energetically on the food as soon as introduced into the mouth.\r\n\r\n  The sublingual glands, atrophied in most Apidæ, but relatively\r\n  voluminous in Sphegidæ, Vespinæ, Polistinæ, Crabronidæ, etc., empty\r\n  their secretion into a small prebuccal excavation, where accumulate\r\n  vegetable and earthy matters collected by the tongue, and the saliva\r\n  secreted by these glands, acts upon them before they pass into the\r\n  pharynx. The lingual glands secrete a thick, sticky liquid, which\r\n  causes foreign bodies to adhere to the tongue, and also agglutinates\r\n  alimentary substances. The uses of the other glands, maxillary and\r\n  paraglossal, are from their minuteness undetermined.

(See pp. 71, 75.) All caterpillars\r\npossess them, and they are best developed in the silkworms, which spin\r\nthe most complete cocoon. Silk-glands also occur in the larvæ of the\r\nTenthredinidæ, in the case-worms or larval Trichoptera, also in certain\r\nchrysomelid beetles (Donacia, Hæmonia), and in a weevil (Hypera). In a\r\ncommon caddis-worm (Limnophilus) the glands are of a beautiful pale\r\nviolet-blue tint, and two and a half times as long as the larva itself;\r\nviz. the body is 20 mm. and the glands 55 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nIn caterpillars the glands are of tubular shape, shining white, and much\r\nlike the ordinary simple tubular salivary glands of the imago. When only\r\nslightly longer than the body they are twice folded, the folds parallel\r\nand situated partly beneath and partly on the side of the digestive\r\ncanal; not usually, when folded in their natural position, extending\r\nmuch behind the end of the stomach; but in the silkworms they are so\r\nlong and folded as to envelop the hinder part of the canal. In geometrid\r\ncaterpillars the glands when stretched out only reach slightly beyond\r\nthe end of the body; in Datana they are half again as long as the body.\r\nHelm thus gives their relative length in certain Eurasian caterpillars,\r\nand we add that of _Telea polyphemus_:—\r\n\r\n _Vanessa io_        length of body  32 mm.; of the silk glands  26 mm.\r\n _Smerinthus tiliæ_  length of body  63 mm.; of the silk glands 205 mm.\r\n _Bombyx mori_       length of body  56 mm.; of the silk glands 262 mm.\r\n _Antheræa yamamaya_ length of body 100 mm.; of the silk glands 625 mm.\r\n _Telea polyphemus_  length of body  60 mm.; of the silk glands 450 mm.\r\n\r\nThus in Telea the silk-glands are about 18.50 inches in length, being\r\nabout seven times as long as the body.\r\n\r\nFor the most complete accounts of the spinning glands of Lepidoptera and\r\ntheir mechanism we are indebted to Helm and to Blanc, and for that of\r\nthe Trichoptera to Gilson.\r\n\r\nThe unpaired portion, or spinning apparatus (_filière_ of Lyonet), is\r\ndivided into two portions; the hinder half being the “thread-press,” the\r\nanterior division the “directing tubes.” The silk material, stored up in\r\nthe thickest portion of the glands, passes into the thread-press (Fig.\r\n334, _A_), which is provided with muscles which force the two double\r\nribbon-like threads through the directing tube, as wire is made by\r\nmolten iron being driven through an iron plate perforated with fine\r\nholes. The entire spinning apparatus, or _filator_, as we may call it,\r\nis situated in the tubular spinneret. The opening of the spinneret is\r\ndirected anteriorly, and the anterior end of the directing tube passes\r\ndirectly into this opening so that the directing tube may be regarded as\r\nan invagination of the lingua.\r\n\r\nThe silk thread which issues from the mouth of the spinneret is, as\r\nLeeuwenhoek discovered, a double ribbon-like band, as may be seen in\r\nexamining the silk of any cocoon.\r\n\r\n=The process of spinning.=—Since the appearance of Helm’s account,\r\nGilson, and also Blanc, have added to our knowledge of the way in which\r\nthe silk is spun and of the mechanism of the process. Gilson has\r\narrived, in regard to the function of the press or filator, at the\r\nfollowing conclusions: 1, the press regulates the thread, it compresses\r\nit, gives it its flattened shape; 2, it regulates the layer of gum[52]\r\n(grès) which surrounds the thread; 3, it may render the thread immovable\r\nby compressing it as if held by pincers.\r\n\r\nThe process of spinning in the silkworm, says Blanc, comprises all the\r\nphenomena by which the mass of silk contained in the reservoir is\r\ntransformed into the silk fluid of which the cocoon is spun. The\r\nexcretory canals each contain a cylindrical thread of silk having a mean\r\ndiameter of 0.2 mm. and surrounded by a layer of gum (_grès_) which in\r\nthe fresh living organ exactly fills the annular space situated between\r\nthe fibroin cylinder and the wall. Arrived within the common duct, the\r\ntwo threads receive the secretion of Filippi’s gland, where the silken\r\nfluid is formed, but has not yet assumed its definite external\r\ncharacters. The two threads press through the common canal and arrive at\r\nthe infundibulum (Fig. 334, _c_) of the press, at the bottom of which is\r\nsituated the orifice of the spinning canal, almost completely divided\r\ninto two by the sharp edge of the rachis (Figs. 334, _a_, 335, _l_). The\r\nthreads each pass into one of the two grooves, and the layer of gum\r\n(_grès_) fills the rest of the canal of the press or filator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 331.—Longitudinal section of the spinneret: _a_, horizontal\r\n    portion of the tongue; _b_, vertical portion; _c_, _f_, circle of\r\n    the tongue; _d_, tongue-pad; _e_, orifice of the spinneret; _g_,\r\n    body of the lyre; _h_, prebasilar membrane forming a fold; _i_,\r\n    internal canal of the spinneret; _k_, filator.—After Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 332.—The lower lip (labium) of _Bombyx mori_, isolated, seen from\r\n    the left side: _A_, lyre; _B_, spinneret; _C_, labial palpus; _D_,\r\n    vertical part of the labium; _E_, horizontal part of the same; _H_,\r\n    _L_, silk-canal; _K_, right gland of Filippi; _L_, canal of the left\r\n    gland; _N_, labial nerve; _a_, oblique fibre of the elevator of the\r\n    labium; _b_, right fibre of the same; _c_, depressor of the labium;\r\n    _d_, superior spinning muscles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 333.—The labium in a horizontal position, seen from the side:\r\n    _f_, the filator or press situated under the external part of the\r\n    spinneret (_d_), between the branches (_b_), of the lyre (_a_); _e_,\r\n    labial palp; _c_, tongue.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 334.—Longitudinal section of the spinneret and press (_filator_):\r\n    _A_, filator or press; _B_, spinneret; _C_–_D_, body of the lyre;\r\n    _F_, lower part of the labium; _E_, common canal; _eh_, its\r\n    epithelium; _G_, superior muscle of the press; _a_, rachis; _b_, its\r\n    posterior enlargement; _c_, infundibulum; _d_, cuticle; _o_, orifice\r\n    of the spinning canal; _op_, central canal of the lyre and of the\r\n    spinneret; _fi_, hypodermis of the lyre; _f_, _f_, hypodermic pad of\r\n    the lyre.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe silken substance is then pressed by the more or less powerful\r\ncontractions of the muscles of the filator, so that the passage of the\r\nthreads is facilitated. If the muscles totally contract, the spinning\r\ncanal is opened wide, the threads pass easily upwards and assume the\r\nform of a triangular prism (Fig. 336).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 335.—Spinning apparatus, seen from above: _A_, opening of the\r\n    spinneret; _B_, central canal of the spinneret (_C_); _D_, common\r\n    canal; _E_, canal of Filippi; _F_, excretory canal of a silk-gland;\r\n    _i_, orifice of the canal of Filippi’s gland; _l_, rachis; _k_, ring\r\n    of the infundibulum; _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, cavity of the\r\n    different canals; _h_, spur which separates the two excretory\r\n    canals.—This and Figs. 331–334 after Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf this contraction diminishes, the chitinous wall of the spinneret\r\ncomes together, owing to its elasticity; the ceiling of the canal\r\napproaches the floor; the cavity tends to take the form of a\r\nsemicircular slit, and the threads are compressed, flattened. As each\r\nmass or thread of silk is much more voluminous than the canal, except\r\nwhen the latter is extremely dilated, it follows that the two threads\r\nare always compressed, or squeezed together, and that each of them is\r\ncompelled to mould itself in the groove it occupies and to take its\r\nshape. Hence the variations in the appearance of the two masses or\r\ndivided portions of silk, which as stated present all grades between the\r\nform of an isosceles-triangular prism and that of a nearly flat ribbon;\r\nbut this last case is quite rare. The use of the spinneret, then, is to\r\ncompress the thread and to change its form more or less considerably, at\r\nthe same time as it diminishes its diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 336.—Diagram of the press and its muscles: _a_, lower; _b_,\r\n    lateral; _c_, upper muscles of the press.—After Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMoreover, this constant compression of the thread as it passes through\r\nthe press keeps it in a certain state of tension so as to allow the\r\ncaterpillar while spinning to firmly hold its thread.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the worm suspends the contraction of its spinning muscles,\r\nthe press flattens, vigorously compresses the thread, and arrests its\r\nmotion, in such a way that if there was a strain on the silken fluid\r\n(_bave_), it would break rather than oblige the caterpillar to let go\r\nany more of it.\r\n\r\nThe press does not act directly on the silken thread, but through the\r\ngummy layer (_grès_) which transmits over the whole surface of the\r\nsilken fluid (_brin_) the pressure exerted on it. After having overcome\r\nthis difficult passage, the silk thread has acquired its definite form;\r\nit rapidly passes out of the spinneret.\r\n\r\n=How the thread is drawn out.=—Having seen, says Blanc, how the two\r\nmasses of silk (_brins_), in passing through the spinning apparatus (or\r\npress), join each other, constituting the frothy silken fluid, thus\r\nbecoming modified in form, it remains to examine the way in which the\r\nthread is drawn out of the spinneret. If we examine a caterpillar while\r\nspinning, it will be seen that in moving its head it draws on the frothy\r\nmass of silk fixed to the web of the cocoon. This traction certainly\r\naids very much the exit of the thread, but it is not the only cause.\r\n\r\nThe silk, Blanc affirms, is pushed out by a force _a tergo_, developed\r\nby different agents, such as the pressure of the distended cuticle or\r\nthe silky mass contained in the reservoir, as seen in the section of a\r\nworm which has spun its cocoon. But if we consider a caterpillar before\r\nit has begun to spin, it is difficult to explain the mechanism of\r\nspinning. As Blanc has often observed, in making sections of the heads\r\nof silkworms, two cases arise. Sometimes the worm has already spun a\r\nlittle, and a certain length of the frothy silk (_bave_) issues from the\r\norifice of the spinneret, where it forms a small twisted bundle. At\r\nother times the worm has not spun since its last moult or the frothy\r\nmass of silk has broken within the head, and we find the end in the\r\ncommon tube. In the first of these two cases, the worm, dilating its\r\npress, is able by a general contraction to discharge a little of the\r\ngritty material (_grès_) which lines the ball of silk hanging at the end\r\nof the spinneret. It can also reject a certain quantity of the secretion\r\nof Filippi’s glands and thus soften the gritty substance. The little\r\nplug of silk can then adhere to the body with which it comes in contact.\r\n\r\nIn the same case it is necessary that the two bits or portions of silk\r\ntraverse the press, and this normally has a calibre less than their\r\ndiameter. The worm should then distend the spinning tube as much as is\r\npracticable, so as to make the openings as large as possible. It has\r\nbeen stated that the press is, in this condition, at least as large as\r\nthe mass of frothy silk. This Blanc believes (although Gilson thinks\r\notherwise) is pushed by a force _a tergo_, and reaches the funnel of the\r\nspinning canal; its two bits of silk (_brins_) unite there, penetrate\r\ninto the canal itself, and, owing to successive impulses produced by the\r\ngeneral contractions of the worm, press through and pass out of the\r\nspinneret.\r\n\r\nWhile the silkworm is engaged in spinning its cocoon, the spinneret and\r\npress execute very varied movements, determined by the elevator,\r\ndepressor, retractor, and protractor muscles of the labium, as well as\r\nthose of the press. These movements, originally very numerous, may\r\ncombine among themselves, so that the spinneret is susceptible of\r\nassuming during the process of spinning still more diverse positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 337.—Portion of the silk-gland of _Bombyx mori_: _p_, tunica\r\n    propria; _i_, tunica intima; _s_, secretion-cell with branched\r\n    nuclei; _a_, separate secretion-cell from the anterior part of the\r\n    silk-gland of _Amphidasis betularia_; _b_, the same of _Vanessa\r\n    urticæ_; _c_, the same in _Smerinthus tiliæ_.—After Helm.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 338.—_A_, section of gland of lepidopter: _B_, section of\r\n    silk-gland of a saw-fly larva; _n_, nucleus; _i.d_, canals; _d.s_,\r\n    cavity.—After Gilson.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHistologically the silk-glands are composed of three layers,—the outer,\r\nor _tunica propria_ (Fig 337); the inner, the _tunica intima_; the\r\nmiddle layer being composed of extraordinarily large epithelial cells\r\nwhich can be seen with the naked eye, and are also remarkable for the\r\nbranched shape of the nuclei (_a_, _b_, _c_, 337), the branches being\r\nmore or less lobed, and the larger the cells the more numerous are the\r\nbranches of the nucleus. Gilson[53] finds that those of Trichoptera,\r\nLepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera ordinarily consist of a small\r\nnumber of cells; and it is quite common, he says, to find only two cells\r\nin a transverse section (Fig. 338, _A_). In the Tenthredinidæ, however,\r\n“the organ still consists of a tube, the wall of which is composed of\r\nflat cells, but in addition to that, two series of spheroidal cells are\r\nattached to the sides. Each of these cells contains a system of tiny\r\ncanals running through their cytoplasm (_B_, _i. d_). These cells are\r\nthe secreting elements; they continually cast the silk substance into\r\nthe tube.” A peculiarity of the _tunica intima_ is its distinct\r\ntransverse striation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 339.—Branching nucleus of spinning gland of Pieris larva.—After\r\n    Korschelt, from Wilson.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 340.—Filippi’s glands (_G_) isolated and seen from above: _e_,\r\n    _e_, its lobules; _d_, its excretory canal; _E_, silk-duct; _C_,\r\n    common canal; _c_, upper spinning muscle; _b_, lower muscle; _a_,\r\n    lateral muscle; _T_, spinneret.—After Blanc.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe lining of the glands and of their common duct is moulted when the\r\ncaterpillar casts its skin, and this, as well as the mode of\r\ndevelopment, shows that the glands are invaginations of the ectoderm.\r\nGilson finds that the silk-glands and silk-apparatus of Trichoptera are\r\nvery similar to those of caterpillars, and that the silk is formed in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\n=Appendages of the silk-gland (Filippi’s glands).=—In most larvæ there\r\nis either a single or a pair of secondary glands which open into the\r\nspinning glands near their anterior end. They are outgrowths of the\r\ngland provided with peculiarly modified excretory cells or evaginations\r\nof the entire glandular epithelium. Those of _Bombyx mori_ (Fig. 340)\r\nare very well developed, and, according to Blanc, form two whitish,\r\nlobulated masses in the labium on each side of the common duct of the\r\nspinning gland. Externally they appear to be acinose; but their\r\nstructure, as described by Blanc and by Gilson, is very peculiar. Helm\r\nthinks, with Cornalia, that the function of these glands is to secrete\r\nthe adhesive fluid which unites the silk threads, and also to make the\r\nsilk more adhesive in the process of spinning, but Blanc states that\r\nthis is done before the thread passes into the common excretory tubes,\r\nand he is inclined to think that the secretion serves to lubricate the\r\nspinneret, and thus to facilitate the passage of the thread. On the\r\nother hand, in certain caterpillars these glands are situated quite far\r\nfrom the spinning apparatus.\r\n\r\n  The silk-glands in the pupa state undergo a process of degeneration,\r\n  and finally completely disappear. They are specific larval organs\r\n  evolved in adaptation to the necessity of the insect’s being\r\n  protected during its pupal life by a cocoon. (Helm.)\r\n\r\n  Morphologically the silk-glands are by Lang regarded as modified\r\n  coxal glands, and homologues of the setiparous parapodial glands of\r\n  chætopod worms, the coxal glands of Peripatus, and the spinning\r\n  glands of spiders.\r\n\r\n  In Scolopendrella, spinning glands are situated in the two last\r\n  segments of the body, opening out at the end of the cercopods (Fig.\r\n  15, _s.gl_), and the larvæ of the true Neuroptera (Chrysopa,\r\n  Myrmeleon, etc.) which spin cocoons, have spinning glands opening\r\n  into the rectum. The silk forming the cocoon of the ant-lion, as\r\n  Siebold and the older observers have stated, is secreted by the\r\n  walls of the rectal or anal sac. Siebold (Anatomy of the\r\n  Invertebrates, p. 445) states that in the larva of Myrmeleon, the\r\n  silk-apparatus is very remarkable, “for the rectum itself is changed\r\n  into a large sac and secretes this substance which escapes through\r\n  an articulated spinneret projecting from the opening of the\r\n  anus”[54] (Fig. 307, _e_). The larvæ of the Mycetophilidæ have\r\n  spinning glands at the hinder end of the body, as also the imago of\r\n  the female of the tineid moth Euplocamus. (Kennel.) The larvæ of\r\n  ichneumons, wasps, bees, of Cecidomyia, and other Diptera, spin\r\n  silken cocoons, but their glands have not yet been examined.\r\n\r\n  It should also be observed that during the process of pupation the\r\n  larvæ of butterflies, of certain flies (Syrphus), and beetles\r\n  (Coccinellidæ and some Chrysomelidæ) attach themselves by silk spun\r\n  from the anus, so that the pupa is suspended by its tail; such\r\n  glands are probably homogenetic with the coxal glands.\r\n\r\n  The silk in its fluid or soft state is mucilaginous, and according\r\n  to Mulder, in the silkworm consists of the following substances,\r\n  varying somewhat in their relative proportions by weight:\r\n\r\n                       Silk-fibre material 53.67\r\n                       Glue (Leim)         20.66\r\n                       Protoplasm          24.43\r\n                       Wax                  1.39\r\n                       Coloring matter      0.05\r\n                       Fat and resin        0.10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE SPINNING GLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Helm, E.= Anatomische und histiologische Darstellung der\r\n  Spinndrüsen der Schmetterlingsraupen.

In the Locustidæ (Anabrus, Fig.\r\n299) and Gryllidæ (Fig. 344, _e_) there are two large, short cæca, and\r\nin the locusts (Caloptenus) there are six cæca, while cockroaches have\r\neight. In the Coleoptera (Carabidæ and Dyticidæ) these large cæca appear\r\nto be replaced by very numerous slender, minute villi or tubules, which\r\narise from the anterior part of the stomach (Figs. 317, _r_, also 342).\r\n\r\nThese cæca differ in structure from the stomach, as shown by Graber, as\r\nwell as by Plateau and by Minot. The latter states that a single\r\ntransverse section of one of the diverticula of the locust demonstrates\r\nat once that its structure is entirely different from that of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 341.—Larva of Sciara: _s.gl_, salivary gland; _ur.t_, urinary\r\n    tubes; _i_ intestine; _st_, stomach; _cae_ cæcal appendages; _t_,\r\n    testis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Its inner surface is thrown up into longitudinal folds, generally\r\n  twelve in number. These folds shine through the outer walls, and are\r\n  accordingly indicated in the drawings of Dufour, Graber, and others.\r\n  The entire cæcum has an external muscular envelope, outside of which\r\n  are a few isolated longitudinal muscular bands. The folds within are\r\n  formed mainly by the high cylindrical epithelium which lines the\r\n  whole interior of the cavity. Tracheæ ramify throughout all the\r\n  layers outside the epithelium. There are appearances of glandular\r\n  follicles in the bottom of the spaces between the folds. (Minot.)\r\n\r\nBurmeister supposed that these cæca were analogous to the pancreas, and\r\nthis view has been confirmed by Hoppe Seyler, Krukenberg, Plateau, and\r\nothers, who claim that the digestive properties of the fluid secreted in\r\nthem agrees with the pancreatic fluid of vertebrates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 342—Cross-section of mid-intestine of _Acilius sulcatus_, showing\r\n    the arrangement of the cæca, two tracheæ passing into each\r\n    cæcum.—After Plateau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n        _d._ The excretory system (urinary or Malpighian tubes)\r\n\r\nThe excretory matters or waste products of the blood tissue of worms are\r\ncarried out of the body by segmentally arranged tubes called\r\n_nephridia_. As a rule they arise in the blood sinuses of the body and\r\nopen externally through minute openings in the skin. As there is a pair\r\nto each segment (in certain oligochete worms two or three pairs to a\r\nsegment), they are often called segmental organs. In the annulate worms\r\neach segment of the body, even the cephalic or oral segment, originally\r\ncontains a pair of these excretory organs. These vessels may have\r\nsurvived in myriopods and perhaps do exist in insects as urinary tubes,\r\nand also occur in many of the Arachnida, and thus are characteristic of\r\neach important class of land arthropods, but are either wanting or are\r\nvery rudimentary or much modified in the marine classes, notably the\r\nCrustacea and Merostomata (Limulus), where they are represented by the\r\nshell-glands of Copepoda, green glands of the lobster, and the brick-red\r\nglands of Limulus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 343.—Digestive canal of _Perla maxima_: _l_, upper lip; _mh_,\r\n    buccal cavity; _ap_, common end of salivary ducts (_ag_); _o_,\r\n    œsophagus; _s_, _s_, salivary glands, arranged segmentally; _b_,\r\n    cæca of chyle-stomach; _lg_, their ligaments of attachment; _mp_,\r\n    urinary tubes; _r_, rectum; _af_, anal orifice.—After Imhof, from\r\n    Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest tracheate arthropod, Peripatus, these tubes are well\r\ndeveloped and are highly characteristic, each segment behind the head\r\nbearing a pair (Fig. 4, _so_{4}_-_so_{9}_). It has been suggested by\r\nsome, but not yet proved, that the urinary tubes of insects are\r\nmorphologically the same as the segmental organs of worms and of\r\nPeripatus; but there are no facts directly supporting this view, and, as\r\nSograff states, it is a pure hypothesis and can only be confirmed or\r\ndisproved by very detailed researches on the development of the urinary\r\ntubes of myriopods and of insects. Others regard them as probably\r\nhomologous with the tracheæ, since they have a similar origin. As,\r\nhowever, they arise in the embryo as outgrowths of the proctodæum they\r\nmay have arisen in myriopods and insects independently, and not be\r\nvermian heirlooms.\r\n\r\nWhile in worms and in Peripatus a pair of these segmental organs occur\r\nin each segment, in insects this serial arrangement is not apparent;\r\nthose with a purely excretory function are not segmentally arranged,\r\nwith outlets opening externally, but arise as outgrowths of the\r\nhind-intestine or proctodæum of the embryo, not being segmentally\r\narranged. The place of their origin is usually the dividing line between\r\nthe mid and hind intestine (Fig. 343, _mp_); this applies to\r\nScolopendrella (Fig. 15, _urt_) as well as to insects.\r\n\r\nThe urinary tubes are usually long, slender, blind, tubular glands\r\nvarying in number from two to over a hundred, which generally arise at\r\nthe constriction between the mid and hind intestine, and which lie\r\nloosely in the cavity of the body, often extending towards the head, and\r\nthen ending near the rectum (Figs. 301, 310, _vm_). They were first\r\ndiscovered by the Italian anatomist Malpighi, after whom they were\r\ncalled the Malpighian tubes. While at first generally regarded as\r\n“biliary” tubes, they are now universally considered to be exclusively\r\nexcretory organs, corresponding to the kidneys of the higher animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 344.—Digestive canal and appendages of the mole-cricket; _a_,\r\n    head: _b_, salivary glands and receptacle; _c_, lateral pouch; _d_,\r\n    stomatogastric nerves; _e_, anterior lobes of stomach; _f_, peculiar\r\n    organ; _g_, neck of stomach; _h_, plicate part of same; _i_, rectum;\r\n    _k_, anal gland; _m_, urinary tubes.—After Dufour, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUsually arising from the anterior end of the hind-intestine where it\r\npasses into the mid-intestine, in certain forms they shift their\r\nposition, in some Hemiptera (Lygæus, Cimex) opening into the rectum,\r\nwhile in the Psyllidæ they arise from the slender hinder part of the\r\nmid-intestine, being widely separated at their origin. (Fig. 321.)\r\n\r\nThe length varies in different groups; where they are few in number (two\r\nto four, six to eight), they are very long, but where very numerous they\r\nare often short, forming dense tufts, each tuft connecting with the\r\nintestine by a common duct (ureter), or, as in the mole-cricket, the\r\nnumerous tubes empty into a single duct (Fig. 344); in the locusts\r\n(Acrydiidæ), however, they are arranged in 10 groups, each group\r\nconsisting of about 15 tubes, making about 150 in all; and are much\r\nconvoluted and wound irregularly around the digestive canal, and when\r\nstretched out being about as long as the entire body.\r\n\r\nThe urinary tubes occur in twos, or in multiples of two, though a\r\nremarkable exception is presented in the dipterous genera Culex and\r\nPsychodes, in which there are five tubes; the young and fully grown\r\nlarvæ, as well as the pupa and imago of Culex, having this number (Fig.\r\n433, _mg_.)\r\n\r\n  In many insects (Pentatoma, Cimex, Velia, Gerris, Haltica, Donacia,\r\n  and often in caterpillars), the vessels open into a sort of urinary\r\n  bladder connecting with the intestine on one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 345.—_A_, section of urinary tube of Periplaneta; _B_, part of\r\n    tube of Perla; _p_, peritoneal membrane; _c_, cavity or lumen;\r\n    _n_, nucleus of a secreting cell.—After Schindler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the larvæ of some insects the blind ends of the tubes are often\r\n  externally bound to the rectum, in the silkworms being attached by\r\n  fine threads to the intestine, while in some flies (Tipula and\r\n  Ctenophora), two vessels may unite to form a loop. In all larval\r\n  Cecidomyiæ, the two tubes are united to form a loop which curves\r\n  backward, opening near the vent, the proctodæum being very short.\r\n  (Giard.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 346.—Portion of a urinary tube of _Calliphora vomitoria_: _tr_,\r\n    trachea; _l_, lumen; _k_, nucleus.—After Gegenbaur.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  While usually the urinary vessels form simple tubes, in many species\r\n  of Lepidoptera and Diptera they are branched, thus resembling those\r\n  of spiders and scorpions. Moreover, in many Lepidoptera and Diptera\r\n  (Fig. 308), the tubes are not simple, but are lobulated, and in some\r\n  Hemiptera (Pentatoma, Notonecta, and Tettigonia) are twisted or\r\n  lace-like. In rare cases there are two kinds of urinary tubes; in\r\n  _Melolontha vulgaris_, two of them are partly lobulated and yellow,\r\n  while the other two are simple and white. Their color in beetles\r\n  varies, some being whitish or yellowish; in Geotrupes, Dyticidæ,\r\n  Hydrophilidæ, etc., reddish brown; in Gryllotalpa as well as\r\n  _Locusta viridissima_, there are two different kinds of vessels,\r\n  differing in contents and in color (white or yellow), as well as\r\n  histologically. (Schindler.)\r\n\r\n  The exterior of the tubes is richly provided with tracheæ, which\r\n  often form a web around them, and the fine branches often seem to\r\n  attach them to the intestine. In Acheta they are enveloped by a very\r\n  delicate, loose network of muscular fibres. (Schindler.)\r\n\r\n  The urinary tubes consist, according to Schindler, of at least three\r\n  cellular layers (Fig. 345):—\r\n\r\n  1. An external, connective, nucleated membrane, the peritoneal\r\n  membrane.\r\n\r\n  2. A very delicate homogeneous basal membrane, the _tunica propria_.\r\n\r\n  3. A single layer of large polygonal excretory cells.\r\n\r\n  4. Lining the internal canal a chitinous layer penetrated by\r\n  pore-canals, the _intima_ often wanting.\r\n\r\n  The secretory cells are usually of the same size, but in many cases\r\n  are relatively small; sometimes four to six or more form the\r\n  periphery of the canal, sometimes three or only two. In some insects\r\n  the cells are so very large that a single cell forms the entire\r\n  periphery. The nuclei in the Lepidoptera (Papilio, Pontia, Cossus)\r\n  are large and irregularly branched.\r\n\r\n  The excretions of the Malpighian vessels, derived from the blood and\r\n  from the fat-body, are more or less fluid and granular, sometimes\r\n  pulpy. From the cells they pass into the canal, thence into the\r\n  intestine, and thence out of the body. How, says Kolbe, the\r\n  secretion passes into the intestine, whether by the contraction of\r\n  the fine fibrillæ of the peritoneal membrane, or by the external\r\n  pressure of the other organs, or by the pressure of the secretory\r\n  matter behind, is not yet known. Grandis observed in living\r\n  Hydrophilus that the urinary tubes moved, without the muscles\r\n  seeming to show what caused the motion. Moreover, the cells\r\n  incessantly changed their form. At a lower temperature such motions\r\n  ceased. The tracheæ, ending freely in the cells, did not anastomose.\r\n  (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  The different colors of the tubes (white, yellow, red, brown, or\r\n  green) is due to the hue of the excretions, and is independent of\r\n  the color of the blood and of the urinary substances held in the\r\n  secreted matter.\r\n\r\n  Schindler found that insects of different stages, collected in\r\n  winter, differed very much in their urinary secretions, the tubes in\r\n  the adults being entirely empty, while in the larvæ they were filled\r\n  full, so that he concluded that in the former the process of\r\n  excretion during the winter hibernation is very slow, but in the\r\n  latter very rapid.\r\n\r\n  As to the activity of the urinary vessels the following experiments\r\n  will throw some light. Tursini fed a Pimelia with fuchsin; its\r\n  urinary tubes were consequently colored red. Schindler fed insects\r\n  with indigo-carmine, which was excreted by the urinary tubes;\r\n  Kowalevsky arrived at the same results, which seems to prove that\r\n  these vessels are analogous to the kidneys of vertebrates. Moreover,\r\n  Schindler injected through the side of the first abdominal segment\r\n  into the cavity of the body of a Gryllotalpa a concentrated solution\r\n  of sodium salt of indigotin-disulphonic acid. After one or two hours\r\n  the external portion of the epithelium of the urinary vessels was\r\n  stained deep blue, while the inner portion remained of the normal\r\n  transparency; the nuclei being for the most part deeply stained.\r\n  Between one and two days after, the staining matter had not yet\r\n  wholly passed through the central canal, the surface recently\r\n  stained still appearing light blue.\r\n\r\nThe solid contents of the urinary tubes consist partly of crystals,\r\nwhich occur singly in the epithelial cells, or form scattered masses\r\nwhen situated in the central canal. Besides tabular rhombic crystals,\r\nthere occur concretions which contain uric acid, and probably consist of\r\nurate of soda, also octahedral crystals of chloride of soda, and\r\nquadro-pyramidal crystals of oxalate of lime. Also acicular prisms\r\noccur; besides chloride of soda, phosphates, carbonate of lime, oxalate\r\nof lime in quantity, leucine, coloring matters, etc.; while the fluid\r\nsecretion also contains urea (?), uric acid, and abundant urates; uric\r\nacid crystals were precipitated by the addition of acetic acid, and by\r\nadding hydrochloric acid crystals belonging to the dimetric system were\r\nformed. The often numerous spheroidal small granules are biurate of soda\r\nand biurate of ammonia. Pale, concentrically banded concretions are\r\nleucine pellets.\r\n\r\n  According to Kölliker the contents of the urinary vessels[55] in\r\n  general are: (1) round granules of urate of soda and urate of\r\n  ammonia; (2) oxalate of lime; and (3) pale transparent concretions\r\n  of leucine. Crystals of taurin are also said to occur. (Claus’\r\n  Zoölogy, p. 531.)\r\n\r\n  Although uric acid is characteristic of the urinary tubes, yet\r\n  sometimes it is wanting in them, while uric acid substances in\r\n  quantity occur in the fat-body or in the mid-intestine.\r\n\r\n  In the living insect the urinary tubes remove urates from the blood;\r\n  “the salts are condensed and crystallized in the epithelial cells,\r\n  by whose dehiscence they pass into the central canals of the tubules\r\n  and thence into the intestine.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n  The process of excretion is carried on not only by the urinary\r\n  tubes, but also, as Cuénot has recently shown (1896) in Orthoptera,\r\n  by the pericardial cells and certain cells of the fat-bodies. In the\r\n  last-named cells urates are stored throughout life; the pericardial\r\n  cells apparently secrete but do not store waste products, which are\r\n  finally eliminated by the urinary tubes, the latter constantly\r\n  eliminating waste.\r\n\r\n  =Primitive number of tubes.=—Wheeler considers the primitive number\r\n  of urinary tubules to be six, other authors regarding two pairs as\r\n  the primary or typical number; and while Wheeler agrees that the\r\n  more ancestral tracheate arthropods had but a single pair,\r\n  Cholodkowsky supposes the primitive number in insects themselves to\r\n  be a single pair. This view is strengthened by the fact that\r\n  Scolopendrella has but a single pair (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\n  While Peripatus has no urinary tubes, in Myriopods a single pair\r\n  arises, as in insects, from the hind-intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 347.—Section of proctodæum of embryo locust, showing origin of\r\n    urinary tubes (_ur.t_); _ep_, epithelial or glandular layer; _m_,\r\n    cells of outer or muscular layer; _a_, section of a tube.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  When in insects the number of these tubes is few, they are, with\r\n  rare exceptions, arranged in pairs, so that Gegenbaur and others\r\n  have considered this paired arrangement as the primitive one. When\r\n  the tubules are very numerous in the adult, as in Orthoptera, the\r\n  embryos and larvæ have a much smaller number, Wheeler stating that\r\n  “in no insect embryo have more than three pairs of these vessels\r\n  been found.” We have observed 10 primary tubes in the embryo of\r\n  Melanopus (Fig. 347), from each of which afterwards arise 15\r\n  secondary tubules. In the Termites, only, do the young forms have\r\n  more urinary tubes than the adults.\r\n\r\n  In Campodea there are about 16 urinary tubes and in Machilis either\r\n  12 (Grassi) or 20 (Oudemans); but in other Thysanura the number is\r\n  much less, Lepisma having either four, six, or eight, according to\r\n  different authors, and both Nicoletia and Lepismina having six,\r\n  opening separately into the hind-intestine. On the other hand, these\r\n  organs have not yet been detected in Japyx. Whether they exist at\r\n  all in the Collembola, which are degenerate forms, is doubtful. The\r\n  weight of opinion denies their existence, though they may yet be\r\n  found existing in a vestigial condition. They are said by Tullberg\r\n  and by Sommer to exist in Podura, but are of peculiar shape.\r\n\r\n  Coming now to the winged insects, in what on the whole is perhaps\r\n  the lowest or most generalized order, the Dermaptera, the number is\r\n  over 30, and their insertions regularly encircle the intestine.\r\n  (Schindler.) In the most ancient and generalized family of\r\n  Orthoptera, the Blattidæ, Schindler detected from 60 to 70 tubes,\r\n  but in a nymph of Periplaneta not quite 10 mm. in length he found\r\n  from 16 to 18, and in nymphs 4 to 5 mm. long there were only eight\r\n  vessels; while Wheeler has found in the embryo of _Phyllodromia\r\n  germanica_ but four tubes. In the adult Acrydiidæ there are as many\r\n  as 150, in the Locustidæ between 40 and 50, and in the Gryllidæ\r\n  about 100.\r\n\r\n  The Ephemeridæ with about 40, the Odonata with 50 to 60 tubules, the\r\n  Perlidæ with from 50 to 60, are polynephrious; while the Termitidæ\r\n  and Psocidæ are oligonephrious, the former having from six to eight\r\n  and the Psocidæ only four tubes. So also all the other orders not\r\n  mentioned, except the Hymenoptera, have few of these tubes. The\r\n  Hemiptera, with none in Aphidæ, a single pair in the Coccidæ, and\r\n  two in all the rest of the order, have the fewest number.\r\n\r\n  In the Neuroptera there are from six to eight, while in a larva,\r\n  possibly that of Chauliodes, Wheeler finds the exceptional number of\r\n  seven.\r\n\r\n  The closely allied order Mecoptera (Panorpidæ), and also the\r\n  Trichoptera, agree with the Neuroptera (Sialis) in having six.\r\n  According to Cholodkowsky all Lepidoptera have six of these vessels,\r\n  except Galleria, which has but four. He finds that in _Tinea\r\n  biselliella_ (also _T. pellionella_ and _Blabophanes rusticella_)\r\n  the larva has six vessels, which, however, undergo histolysis during\r\n  pupation, a single pair arising in their stead. On this account he\r\n  regards the primitive number of urinary tubes as two, or a single\r\n  pair, this return from six vessels in the larva to two in the imago\r\n  being considered a case of atavism.\r\n\r\n  In the Coleoptera, the number of urinary tubes is from four to six;\r\n  in what few embryo beetles have been examined (Doryphora,\r\n  Melolontha), there are six vessels, but in the embryo of _Dyticus\r\n  fasciventris_, Wheeler has detected only four, this number being\r\n  retained in the adult. He thinks that in beetles in general, a pair\r\n  of vessels must be “suppressed during post-embryonic development,\r\n  presumably in early larval life.”\r\n\r\n  In Diptera and Siphonaptera, the number four is very constant, there\r\n  being, however, a fifth one in Culex and Psychoda (Fig. 400.)\r\n\r\n  The number of these vessels is very inconstant in the Hymenoptera,\r\n  varying from six (Tomognathus, an ant, worker) to 12 (Myrmica), and\r\n  in Apis reaching the number of 150.\r\n\r\n  In the embryo of the honey-bee and wall-bee (Chalicodoma), there are\r\n  only four; we still lack any knowledge of the number in embryo\r\n  saw-flies.\r\n\r\nThe following is a tabular view of insects with few urinary tubes\r\n(Oligonephria) and many (Polynephria). It will be seen that the number\r\nhas little relation to the classification or phylogeny, insects so\r\ndistantly related as the Orthoptera and Hymenoptera being\r\npolynephrious:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Oligonephria_\r\n\r\n Collembola, 2 (Podura), Tullberg and also Sommer.\r\n Thysanura, 4 (Lepisma); in Campodea, 16; in Machilis, 12 or 20; wanting\r\n    in Japyx.\r\n Psocidæ, 4.\r\n Termitidæ, 6 (many in the young, Rathke).\r\n Mallophaga, 4.\r\n Physapoda, 4.\r\n Hemiptera, 2 (Coccidæ, none in Aphidæ).\r\n Neuroptera, 6–8.

Ratzeburg had stated that the\r\n  last segment of the body was in the form of a vesicle. Koulaguine\r\n  now shows that this vesicle is in reality the end of the intestine\r\n  opening upwards; as the result of this dorsal opening of the\r\n  intestine the Malpighian vessels open on the sides of the oval vent,\r\n  and have no connection with the intestinal canal. Whether this is of\r\n  morphological import, or is only a secondary adaptation, Koulaguine\r\n  does not state, his paper being a preliminary abstract.\r\n\r\nWheeler thus sums up our present knowledge regarding the number and\r\nhomologies of the Malpighian or urinary tubes:\r\n\r\n  1. It is very probable that the so-called Malpighian vessels of\r\n  Crustacea and Arachnida are not the homologues of the _vasa\r\n  Malpighi_ of the Eutracheata (insects and myriopods).\r\n\r\n  2. The Malpighian vessels of the Eutracheata arise as paired\r\n  diverticula of the hind-gut and are, therefore, ectodermal.\r\n\r\n  3. In no insect embryo are more than six vessels known to occur;\r\n  although frequently only four are developed.\r\n\r\n  4. The number six occurs either during embryonic or post-embryonic\r\n  life in members of the following groups: Apterygota, Orthoptera,\r\n  Corrodentia; Neuroptera, Panorpata, Trichoptera, Coleoptera,\r\n  Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  5. The number four seems to be typical for the Corrodentia,\r\n  Thysanoptera, Aphaniptera, Rhynchota, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  6. The embryonic number in Dermaptera, Ephemeridea, Plecoptera, and\r\n  Odonata has not been ascertained, but will probably be found to be\r\n  either four or six.\r\n\r\n  7. There is evidence that in at least one case (Melolontha), the\r\n  tetranephric is ontogenetically derived from the hexanephric\r\n  condition by the suppression of one pair of tubules.\r\n\r\n  8. It is probable that the insects which never develop more than\r\n  four Malpighian vessels have lost a pair during their phylogeny.\r\n\r\n  9. The post-embryonic increase in the number of Malpighian vessels\r\n  in some orders (Orthoptera, Odonata, Hymenoptera) is secondary and\r\n  has apparently arisen to supply a demand for greater excreting\r\n  surface.[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              LITERATURE ON THE EXCRETORY (URINARY) ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Malpighi, M.= Dissertatio epistolica de Bombyce, Societati regiæ\r\n    Londini ad scientiam naturalem promovendam institutæ dicata.\r\n    (Londini, 1669, 12 Pls.)\r\n\r\n  =Herold, M.

Paris, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _e._ Poison-glands\r\n\r\nPoison-glands are mainly confined to the stinging Hymenoptera, _i.e._\r\ncertain ants, and the wasps and bees, but also occur in the mosquito,\r\nwhile many, if not most bugs, seem to instil a drop of poison into the\r\npunctured wounds they make.\r\n\r\nIn the honey and other bees the poison apparatus consists of two\r\npoison-glands whose secretion passes by a single more or less convoluted\r\nefferential duct into the large poison-sac, and thence by the excretory\r\nduct, which is enlarged at the base of the sting (Figs. 194, 195), out\r\nthrough the sting by the same passage as the eggs. According to Carlet,\r\nthe poison apparatus of bees consists of two kinds of glandular organs,\r\nof which one kind secretes a feebly alkaline fluid, the other an acid\r\nproduct. The poison is only effective when both fluids are mixed. The\r\nresultant venom is always acid. The action of this venom upon some\r\nanimals, as rabbits, frogs, and certain beetles, is slight; but the\r\ndomestic fly and the flesh-fly are immediately killed by it. The\r\ninoculation of a fly with the secretion of one of the glands does not\r\nproduce death until after a considerable time, but death follows very\r\nquickly if the same fly is subjected to a second inoculation, this time\r\nwith the secretion of the other gland. The alkaline glands are in bees\r\nand all poisonous Hymenoptera strongly developed, but become vestigial\r\nin those forms which sting their prey to serve as food for their larvæ.\r\nThe poison which the solitary sand and wood wasps and Pompilidæ inject\r\ninto their victims only paralyzes them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 348.—The poison apparatus of Ichneumon: _T_, sting; _GA_ acid\r\n    gland; _TG_, _R′_, its tubes opening into the common poison-sac or\r\n    reservoir; _ce_, its efferent canal; _Ga_, the tubular alkaline\r\n    gland; _R_, the glandular end; _a_, the reservoir; _ce_, its duct;\r\n    _Gac_, the accessory gland—After Bordas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 349.—Cephalic gland of Belostoma.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Bordas has found both the alkaline gland (gland of Dufour) and the\r\n  acid gland to occur in a hundred species of Hymenoptera, including\r\n  not only Aculeata, but also Ichneumonidæ (Fig. 348), Tenthredinidæ,\r\n  and they may be safely said to be of general occurrence. The acid\r\n  gland consists of three parts, the glandular portion, the reservoir\r\n  for the poison, and the secretory canal. The alkaline gland is an\r\n  irregular tube, with a striated surface and without a reservoir. In\r\n  most Hymenoptera there is still a third gland, which is unpaired,\r\n  granular, rectangular or lanceolate, with a short filamentous duct\r\n  which opens beside the orifice of the alkaline glands.\r\n\r\nThe poison in ants, wasps, and bees consists of two substances, _i.e._\r\nformic acid and a whitish, fatty, bitter residue in the secretion of the\r\nglands; the corroding active formic acid is the essential part of the\r\npoison. (Will.)\r\n\r\nIn Melipona the sting and poison-glands are aborted; in certain ants\r\n(Formica, Lasius, etc.) the sting is wanting, but the poison-sac is\r\nextraordinarily large.\r\n\r\n  Bordas finds in various species of Ichneumon three kinds of glands\r\n  opening into the base of the sting. The first two correspond to the\r\n  acid (Fig. 348, _G.A_) and alkaline (_G.A_) glands of bees and wasps\r\n  (Vespidæ, etc.), and the third (_G.ac_) is situated between the two\r\n  lateral muscular bundles which attach the base of the sting to the\r\n  last abdominal segment. The poison-reservoir (Fig. 348, _V_) is\r\n  recognized by its yellow color and diaphanous and striated\r\n  appearance. It is situated on the left of the hind-intestine, a\r\n  little in front of the rectum. The tubular gland (_Ga_) or alkaline\r\n  gland of aculeate Hymenoptera is remarkably large; it is situated on\r\n  the left side of the body. The accessory gland (_G.A_) is elongated,\r\n  triangular, flat, its duct opening at the base of the alkaline\r\n  gland; it is formed of small spherical cells. Bordas has met with\r\n  well-developed poison-glands in forty species belonging to the\r\n  Terebrantia, including that of Tenthredo, Emphytus, as well as\r\n  various genera of Ichneumonidæ, but in all these species the\r\n  accessory gland was wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 350.—View from above of the cephalic gland of Belostoma, ×\r\n    20.—This and Fig. 349 after Locy.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnder the name of cephalic glands (Fig. 349), Locy describes a pair of\r\nglands in the head of Nepidæ. The epithelial or secreting cells are\r\n8–sided (Fig. 350). “When these insects are irritated,” he says, “a\r\nsecretion is freely thrown out around the base of the beak, which\r\nproduces death very quickly when introduced on a needle point into the\r\nbody of an insect.” He infers that the cephalic glands may be the source\r\nof this poisonous secretion. The poisonous salivary fluid of the larva\r\nof Dyticus is referred to on p. 324.\r\n\r\nThat the mosquito injects poison into the wound it makes has been proved\r\nby Macloskie, who discovering fine droplets of a yellow oily-looking\r\nfluid escaping from the end of the hypopharynx, afterwards detected the\r\npoison-glands. It appears that the two salivary glands are subdivided,\r\neach into three lobes, the middle of which (Fig. 351, _pg_) differs from\r\nthe others in having evenly granulated contents and staining more deeply\r\nthan the others. Having examined the preparations, we agree with the\r\ndiscoverer that these lobes secrete the poison. The poison is diluted by\r\nthe secretion of the salivary lobes, and the two efferent ducts, one\r\nfrom each set of glands, “carry forward and commingle the\r\nvenomo-salivary products in the main duct; and the stream is then\r\ncarried by the main duct to the reservoir at the base of the\r\nhypopharynx.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351.—_A_, median section of head, showing (_du_) the\r\n    venomo-salivary duct, with its insertion in (_hy_) the hypopharynx;\r\n    _cb_, brain; below is the pharyngeal pump, leading from (_œ_) the\r\n    œsophagus; _lre_, base of labrum-epipharynx; _m_, muscle; _n_,\r\n    commissure (other parts removed). _B_, the venomo-salivary duct,\r\n    showing its bifurcation, and the three glands on one of its\r\n    branches; _pg_, poison gland; _sg_, the upper of the two salivary\r\n    glands. _C_, the bifurcation of the duct, with its nucleated\r\n    hypodermis.—After Macloskie.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _f._ Adhesive or cement-glands\r\n\r\nDewitz has discovered in ants and bees, in close connection with the\r\npoison-glands, and like them discharging their secretion through the\r\nsting, cement-glands. They arise by budding at the base of the\r\npoison-glands.\r\n\r\nThe two glands in these Hymenoptera correspond to the tubular glands of\r\nthe Orthoptera, which open at the base of the inner sheath of the\r\novipositor (Fig. 299, _sb_), so that the secretion flows out through it\r\nas the poison of bees, etc., out of the sting. The use of the secretion\r\nof these glands is either to glue the eggs together, or to afford\r\nmaterial for the egg-case of cockroaches and Mantidæ and the gummy\r\negg-case of the locusts, etc. The contents of the cement-glands serves\r\nfor the fixture of the eggs after deposition. In the stinging\r\nHymenoptera one of the cement-glands is an accessory gland; the other\r\nbecomes the poison-sac. The cement-glands are in the Hemiptera only\r\nshort blind sacs, in the Lepidoptera and Diptera long convoluted tubes,\r\ntubular and branched in the Coleoptera, or richly branched in the\r\nIchneumonidæ and Tenthredinidæ. In the cockroach there are two\r\ncement-glands, but the right one is probably of no functional\r\nimportance. The left one is filled with a milky substance, containing\r\nmany crystals and a coagulable fluid, out of which the egg-capsule\r\n(oötheca) is formed. (Miall and Denny.) In the locusts the sebific or\r\ncement-gland (Fig. 298, _sb_) secretes a copious supply of a sticky\r\nfluid, which is poured out as the eggs pass out of the oviduct and\r\nagglutinates the eggs into a mass, forming a thin coating around each\r\negg, which from the mutual pressure of the eggs causes the tough coating\r\nto be pitted hexagonally. In other insects also (Trichoptera,\r\nChrysopidæ, Lepidoptera, etc.) there are similar secretions for the\r\nprotection or fastening of the eggs when laid.[57] The Trichoptera lay\r\ntheir eggs either in or on the surface of the water in bunches or in\r\nstrings or in annular gelatinous masses on stones or on plants. This\r\njelly-like substance is secreted by two highly developed paired anal\r\nglands. (Weltner, in Kolbe, p. 621.) Also in certain dragon-flies\r\n(Libellula, Diplax, and Epitheca) the eggs are laid in jelly-like\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nWith a similar secretion, spun from the end of the abdomen, the Psocidæ\r\ncover their little bunches of eggs laid on the under side of leaves; and\r\nthe silk thread forming the egg-sac of the great water-beetle\r\n(Hydrophilus) is secreted from such anal glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _g._ The wax-glands\r\n\r\nBesides the honey-bee, which secretes wax in little scales on the under\r\nside of the abdomen, the bodies of many other insects, such as the plant\r\nand bark lice, as well as the Psyllidæ, Cicadidæ (especially Flata and\r\nLystra), are covered with a waxy powder, or as in Chermes, Schizoneura,\r\nFlata, etc., with wool-like filaments of wax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 352.—Under side of worker honey-bee, carrying wax scales, ×\r\n    3.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 353.—Nymph of Lachnus, showing position of wax-glands.—Gissler\r\n    _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wax is secreted by minute unicellular dermal glands, which in the\r\nlower insects (Hemiptera) are distributed nearly all over the body, but\r\nin the bees are restricted either to the under (Apis, Fig. 352) or upper\r\nside (Trigona) of the end of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe wax-glands of Pemphigus, Chermes, etc., lie under the little warts,\r\nseen in _Lachnus strobi_, the white-pine aphis, to be distributed in\r\ntransverse lines across the back and sides of the abdominal segments\r\n(Fig. 353). These warts are surrounded by a chitinous ring, and divided\r\ninto delicately marked areas. Through the delicate numerous pits in the\r\nchitinous membrane of these areas the little waxen threads project,\r\nsince under each area ends a duct leading from a large glandular cell,\r\nwhich is a specially modified hypodermis cell (Claus). The wax threads\r\nare hollow, and all those arising from a single glued cell form a\r\nbundle, whose threads separate from each other and form a white woolly\r\ndown or bloom covering the body. Witlaczil also shows that gall-forming\r\nAphids secrete a wax-like substance, which, during the movements of the\r\ninsects in the gall, is rubbed off, becoming a watery layer mixed with\r\nthe fluid excrement, which forms a spherical impervious layer lining the\r\ngall, and thus rendering possible the mode of life of the gall-lice.\r\n\r\nIn the Psyllidæ Witlaczil has discovered wax-glands which also secrete\r\nslender waxen threads. They are situated in groups of two or three at\r\nthe end of the abdomen near the anus, and arise from hypodermis cells.\r\nThe wax threads surround the liquid excrement as it passes out of the\r\nvent, covering it with a continuous layer of wax. The excrement\r\naccordingly is discharged very slowly and gradually, in sausage-shaped\r\nmasses slightly strung together and rolled into close spirals. The body\r\nbecomes unavoidably smeared with the sticky excrement, since it is not\r\nentirely covered by the waxy layer. Moreover, in the larvæ of many\r\nPsyllidæ waxen threads are formed on the upper side of the abdomen; they\r\nare for the most part tightly curled or frizzly, like wool, and form,\r\nthough partly torn, a waxen coat, chiefly on the side and back of the\r\nthorax and abdomen. The insects appear therefore as if covered with\r\ndust. The mature animals of many species are also covered with a waxen\r\ndown. The wax threads rapidly dissolve and disappear in alcohol. From a\r\nwax-like substance more or less easily dissolved in alcohol arise\r\npeculiar hair-like structures which, in the larvæ of Psyllidæ, are\r\nsituated on the side and end of the body and also on the rudiments of\r\nthe wings. They are readily distinguished from ordinary hairs, as they\r\narise from glandular cells, and are of very different lengths, more or\r\nless like bristles, but hollow, and very brittle. They are leaf-like in\r\nthe first nymphal stages of _Trioza rhamni_, but in following stages\r\nbecome narrow and form a row around the entire periphery of the body.\r\n\r\nThe waxen dorsal shield which protects the body of bark-lice (Coccidæ)\r\nis a similar product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 354.—Young nymph and developing scale of _Aspidiotus\r\n    perniciosus_: _a_, ventral view of nymph, showing sucking beak with\r\n    setæ separated, with enlarged tarsal claw at right; _b_, dorsal view\r\n    of same, somewhat contracted, with the first waxy filaments\r\n    appearing; _c_, dorsal and lateral views of same, still more\r\n    contracted, illustrating further development of wax secretion; _d_,\r\n    later stage of same, dorsal and lateral views, showing matting of\r\n    wax secretions and first form of young scale; all greatly\r\n    enlarged.—After Howard and Marlatt, Bull. 3, N. S., Div. Ent., U. S.\r\n    Dept. of Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Witlaczil has described the way it is formed in Aspidiotus and\r\n  Leucaspis. The freshly hatched nymph shows no signs of a waxy\r\n  secretion. But eventually waxen threads arise first on the hinder\r\n  and anterior end of the body, and then over the whole surface. These\r\n  threads interlace into a sort of felting and thus form the shield,\r\n  which is usually much larger than the body and lies closely upon it.\r\n  The shield is formed after the first moult. It is noteworthy that\r\n  these threads are matted together to form as thick a tissue as that\r\n  of the shield itself. The shield is whitish or gray and rather thin.\r\n  On the thinnest part of the edge the single threads may be drawn\r\n  out. The growth of the shield advances with the increase in size of\r\n  the nymph around the entire edge, but is greatest behind. The first\r\n  two larval skins are retained on the back under the shield. Also a\r\n  very thin waxen pellicle remains on the resting place of the insect\r\n  when it is raised. The wax-glands open in the pitted fields, and\r\n  appear as clear brownish cells which are distinguished from the\r\n  ordinary hypodermis cells by their greater size. (Witlaczil. Compare\r\n  also Fig. 354.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 355.—Wax disks of social bees: _a_, _Apis mellifica_, worker;\r\n    _b_, do., queen; _c_, Melipona, worker; _d_, Bombus, worker.—From\r\n    Insect Life, U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wax-glands in the honey-bee are scale-shaped organs situated on the\r\nunder side of the four last abdominal segments (Fig. 355). These secrete\r\nthe wax, which appears as whitish scales, and secretion is only possible\r\nwhen the bees have sufficient honey and pollen. The wax is secreted by\r\nthe hypodermal cells rather than by glands within the abdominal cavity;\r\nthe wax traverses the cuticular layer, and accumulates on its outer\r\nsurface (Carlet). According to Fritz Müller, in the stingless bees\r\n(Trigona) which he observed, the wax-glands are situated on the back of\r\nthe abdomen, but Ihering states that in many species of Trigona and\r\nMelipona there are also slightly developed wax-organs on the ventral\r\nside.\r\n\r\n  It has been found that certain caterpillars secrete wax. Thus the\r\n  cells of the Tortrix of the fir (_Retinia resinella_) formed of\r\n  resin are lined with wax, as on dissolving away the resin with\r\n  alcohol, Dr. Knaggs found a slight film of wax; also a secretion of\r\n  wax has been detected in the larva of a butterfly (_Parnassius\r\n  apollo_). The bodies of certain saw-fly larvæ are covered with a\r\n  white powdery secretion, while the remarkable larva of a Selandria\r\n  is clothed with snow-white, long, flocculent, waxy masses, nearly\r\n  concealing the body (Fig. 356).\r\n\r\n\r\n                _h._ “Honey-dew” or wax-glands of Aphids\r\n\r\nThe so-called “honey-dew” of Aphids which oozes from two wart-like\r\ntubercles or tubes situated near the end of the body, is secreted by\r\nhypodermal unicellular glands which open into a modification of a\r\npore-canal, the tube itself being an outgrowth of the cuticula.\r\n\r\n  Witlaczil states that both in the “honey” tubes and in the body\r\n  beneath, the sugary matter exists in cells of the connective tissue\r\n  in the form of granules. “These large ‘sugar-cells’ in contact with\r\n  the air undergo destruction, while the sugar crystallizes into\r\n  needles, and thus each cell is transformed into a radiated\r\n  crystalline mass.”\r\n\r\n  “A muscle extends from a horseshoe-shaped place (a valve?) in the\r\n  middle of the flat terminal plate of the honey tube, through this\r\n  and down through the abdomen to the ventral surface. By this muscle\r\n  the honey tube is at times erected, and we then find, as also when\r\n  we lightly press the body of the insect, lumps of crystallized sugar\r\n  which have been expressed through the tips of the honey tubes.”\r\n  (Zool. Anzeiger, 1882, p. 241.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 356.—Wax-secreting larva of a saw-fly.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 357.—_Lachnus strobi_, and its two “honey” warts.—Gissler\r\n    _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Busgen, after careful research, denies that this is a sugar, but\r\n  claims as the result of chemical analysis, that it is more like wax.\r\n  He observed that on reaching the air the drops issuing from the\r\n  “nectary” or “honey” tube stiffened almost instantly into a wax-like\r\n  mass, which was easily crushed between the teeth, and had no taste\r\n  at all. No sugar-like substance or urea could be detected. He\r\n  therefore concludes that the secretion in question should be\r\n  regarded as a wax-like mass, which agrees well with Witlaczil’s\r\n  anatomical observations, and confirms the statements of previous\r\n  observers. Thus, as early as 1815, Kyber stated that the Aphides\r\n  expelled an excrementitious substance through the “sap tubes.”\r\n  Burmeister states that the tubes give out a fluid which “dries\r\n  gumlike, but, so far as I have observed, has no peculiar taste.”\r\n  Réaumur, and also Kaltenbach, state that the “honey” does not issue\r\n  from the tubes, but from the anus. Lastly, Forel emphatically states\r\n  that “the two dorsal tubes of Aphides do not secrete a sweet fluid,\r\n  but a gluey wax, which is not sought by the ants. Moreover the\r\n  shield-lice and many leaf-lice have no such tubes, but yet are often\r\n  sought by ants. The drops of sugar which the ants lick up are rather\r\n  the excrement of the insects in question.” Hence the opinion first\r\n  stated by Linné, that a sweet fluid is secreted by Aphides, must be\r\n  abandoned.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, Busgen, after careful observations, finds that\r\n  the use of the sticky, waxen secretion is in reality a protective\r\n  one, as he observed that when a larval Chrysopa rudely attacks the\r\n  Aphides, they smear its face with the sticky wax, causing at least a\r\n  momentary interruption in its attacks. He also observed that Aphides\r\n  when invaded by coccinellid larvæ set their tubes in motion and\r\n  besmear their heads and front part of the body. He thus seems to\r\n  establish the fact that these tubes secrete a protective, sticky\r\n  fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _i._ Dermal glands in general\r\n\r\nWe have seen that certain of the hypodermal cells may be modified or\r\nspecialized to form secretory unicellular glands. Such are those\r\n(trichogens) which secrete chitinous setæ, hairs, and spines, certain\r\nsetæ in some insects being hollow and containing a poison (p. 187);\r\nothers secrete wax, certain ones in Aphids “honey-dew”; in some cases\r\ndermal glands may excrete protective, sticky, or otherwise offensive\r\nmatters, or may be depuratory, or facilitate the process of moulting.\r\n\r\nThere are other minute, unicellular, or compound dermal glands whose\r\nfunction is unknown.\r\n\r\nDermal glands may be segmentally or serially arranged. Thus Verson has\r\ndetected a series of one or two pairs of unicellular glands near the\r\nstigmata in each thoracic, and the first eight abdominal segments of the\r\nsilkworm (_B. mori_). In the earliest stages of growth of the\r\ncaterpillar they give out oxalate of lime, and in later stages uric\r\nacid. They thus appear to act interchangeably with the urinary tubes, as\r\nexcretory organs. They do not, however, carry their products directly\r\noutwards, but leave them between the hypodermis and cuticula, in order\r\nto facilitate the sloughing off of the latter in the process of\r\nmoulting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LITERATURE ON THE SECRETORY GLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _a._ General\r\n\r\n  =Sirodot, S.= Recherches sur les sécrétions chez les Insectes.

In the winged\r\ninsects they are of frequent occurrence, existing under great variety of\r\nform, varying greatly in position, and appearing usually to be in\r\nimmediate relation with their active volant habits. Their presence is in\r\ndirect adaptation to the needs and habits of their possessors, and being\r\nrepellent, warning, or defensive structures, the odors they secrete\r\nbeing often exceedingly nauseous, they appear to have been called into\r\nexistence in direct response to their biological environment. The fact\r\nthat these singular organs do not exist in marine or aquatic Crustacea\r\nsuggests that the air-breathing, aërial, or volant insects by these\r\neversible glands, usually in the form of simple evaginable hypodermic\r\npouches, are enabled to protect themselves by emitting an infinitesimal\r\namount of an offensively odorous fluid or ether-like spray which charges\r\nthe air throughout an extent of territory which may be practically\r\nillimitable to the senses of their enemies. The principle is the same as\r\nin the mephitic sulphuretted oil ejected by the skunks, the slight\r\nquantity these creatures give out readily mixing with and charging the\r\natmosphere within a radius of many miles of what we may call the centre\r\nof distribution.\r\n\r\nAs is now well known, the very delicate, attenuated highly volatile\r\nodors exhaled are perceived by insects with extreme ease and rapidity,\r\nthe degree of sensitiveness to such scents being enormously greater than\r\nin vertebrates, their organs of sense being developed in a corresponding\r\ndegree. Professors Fischer and Penzoldt, of Erlangen, have recently\r\nestablished the fact that the sense of smell is by far the most delicate\r\nof the senses. They find that the olfactory nerve is able to detect the\r\npresence of 1⁄2,760,000,000 of a grain of mercaptan.[58] The smallest\r\nparticle of matter that can be detected by the eye is sodium, when\r\nobserved by the spectroscope, and this particle is 250 times coarser\r\nthan the particle of mercaptan which can be detected by the human nose.\r\n\r\n  In those Arachnida which are provided with poison-glands, these\r\n  scent-glands are absent, but in certain Acarina and Linguatulidæ,\r\n  which have no poison-glands, there are various oil-glands, stigmatic\r\n  glands, as well as scent-glands, and in seizing a Thelyphonus with\r\n  the forceps we have observed it to send out from each side of the\r\n  body a jet of offensive spray.\r\n\r\n  We not infrequently find in myriopods (Polydesmidæ, Julidæ, and\r\n  Glomeris) repugnatorial or the so-called cyanogenic glands, which\r\n  are either paired, opening on the sides of the body, or form a\r\n  single row along the median line of the under side of the body.\r\n  Leidy describes and figures the spherical glands of _Julus\r\n  marginatus_, of which there are 50 pairs. These glands have been\r\n  regarded as modified nephridia, but are more probably coxal glands,\r\n  and the homologues of the parapodial glands of annelid worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 358.—Sternite of _Machilis maritima_, with the pair of coxal sacs\r\n    (_cb_) on the right side everted; _hs_, coxal appendages; _m_,\r\n    retractor muscles.—After Oudemans, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Eversible coxal glands.=—True coxal glands occur in _Scolopendrella\r\nimmaculata_ on the 2d to 11th segment, on the inner side of the base of\r\nthe legs (Fig. 15, _c.g._). Homologous glands also occur in the same\r\nposition in _Campodea staphylinus_ (also in _C. cookei_ and _C.\r\nmexicana_) on the 1st to 8th abdominal segments, and Oudemans has\r\ndescribed a pair of eversible sacs on each side of segments one to seven\r\nof Machilis. These eversible sacs in the synapterous insects are\r\nevidently modified coxal glands, and are probably repugnatorial as well\r\nas respiratory in function.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of an eversible gland, composed of hypodermic\r\ncells, usually retracted by a slender muscle and with an efferent\r\npassage, but the glands vary greatly in shape and structure in different\r\ninsects. In some cases these fœtid glands appear not to be the\r\nhomologues of the coxal glands, but simply dermal glands.\r\n\r\nThese repugnatorial glands are of not infrequent occurrence in the lower\r\nor more generalized winged insects, and in situation and appearance are\r\nevidently the homologues of the coxal glands of the Symphyla and\r\nSynaptera.\r\n\r\n_Fœtid glands of Orthoptera._—In the ear-wigs (Forficula and Chelidura)\r\nMeinert has detected a pair of what he calls fœtid glands at the\r\nposterior margin of the dorsal plates of the 2d and 3d abdominal\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\nVosseler also describes the same glands as consisting of a retort-shaped\r\nsac, in whose walls are numerous small hypodermal cells and large single\r\nglandular cells provided with an efferent passage, the fluid being\r\nforced out by the pressure of the dermal muscles, one acting specially\r\nto retract the gland. The creature can squirt to a distance of 5 and\r\neven 10 cm. (4 inches) a yellowish-brown liquid or emulsion with the\r\nodor of a mixture of carbolic acid and creosote.\r\n\r\nThe large eversible dorsal glands of the Blattidæ, since they contain\r\nnumerous hairs, which, when everted, are fan-like or like tufts, serve,\r\nas in the spraying or scent apparatus, to disseminate the odor, and\r\nmight be classified with the alluring unicellular scent-glands or\r\n_duftapparat_ of other insects, as they are by some authors; but as the\r\nglands are large and compound they may prove to be the homologues of the\r\ncoxal glands rather than of the dermal glands.\r\n\r\nEvaginable organs in the Blattids were first observed by Gerstæcker in\r\nboth sexes of Corydia; they are yellowish white, covered with hairs, and\r\nare thrust out from between the dorsal and ventral plates of the 1st and\r\n2d abdominal segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 359._—Under side of end of Aphlebia, showing the two eversible\r\n    sacs; _V-X_, five last abdominal segments; _A_, portion showing the\r\n    hairs; _B_, showing origin of a hair in its follicle.—After Krauss.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the cockroach (_P. orientalis_) Minchin detected two pouch-like\r\ninvaginations of the cuticle, lying close on each side of the middle\r\nline of the body between the 5th and 6th tergites of the abdomen. They\r\nare lined by a continuation of the cuticle, which forms, within the\r\npouches, numerous stiff, branched, finely pointed bristles, beneath\r\nwhich are a number of glandular epithelial cells. In the male nymph of\r\n_P. decorata_ he also found beside these glandular pouches “an\r\nadditional gland, opening by a tubular duct under the intersegmental\r\nmembrane between the 5th and 6th terga above the glandular pouch of each\r\nside, and extending forward into the body cavity. The gland and its duct\r\nare proliferations of the hypodermis, and there is no invagination of\r\nthe cuticle.” These eversible glands are most complicated in\r\n_Phyllodromia germanica_. While it is absent in the female, in the male\r\nit is relatively of enormous size, extending over the 6th and 7th\r\nsomites, as well as projecting far into the body cavity (Minchin). Haase\r\nstates that these glands become everted by blood-pressure and give out\r\nthe well-known disagreeable smell of these insects. He states that in\r\nthe male of _P. germanica_ the dorsal glands in the 6th and 7th\r\nabdominal segments are without hairs and produce an oily secretion; they\r\nfunction as odoriferous organs in sexual union.\r\n\r\nIn the male of another Blattid (_Aphlebia bivittata_) of the Canary\r\nIslands, Krauss has detected two yellowish dorsal sacs 1.5 mm. in\r\nlength, opening out on the 7th abdominal segment, and filled full of\r\nlong yellowish hairs, the ends directed towards the opening, where they\r\nform a thick tuft. These eversible glands lined with hairs appear to be\r\nclosely similar to the long slender eversible hairy appendages or scent\r\norgans of certain Arctian and Syntomid moths. (Fig. 359.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 360.—External flaps (_gl_) of glands of Platyzosteria.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have found the external median wart with lateral lids or flaps in\r\nbetween the 5th and 6th tergites of _Platyzosteria ingens_ Scudder, a\r\nlarge wingless Blattid living under the leaf scars of the cocoanut tree\r\nin Southern Florida (Fig. 360), but were unable to detect them in\r\nPolyzosteria or in the common Blabera of Cuba, or in another genus from\r\nCordova, Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn another group of Orthoptera, the Phasmidæ, occur a pair of dorsal\r\nprothoracic glands, each opening by a pore and present in both sexes. In\r\nthe walking-stick, _Anisomorpha buprestoides_, ♂ and ♀, these openings\r\nare situated on each side of the prothorax at its upper anterior\r\nextremity, situated at the bottom of a large deep pit. When seized it\r\ndischarged a “milky white fluid from the pores of the thorax, diffusing\r\na strong odor, in a great measure like that of the common Gnaphalium or\r\nlife everlasting” (Peale in Say’s American Entomology, i, p. 84). Boll\r\nstates that the females when captured “spurt from the prothorax,\r\nsomewhat after the manner of bombardier beetles, a strong vapor, which\r\nslightly burnt the skin; when the females were seized by the males a\r\nthick fluid oozed from the same spot.” Scudder describes these glands in\r\nanother Phasmid (_Autolyca pallidicornis_) as two straight, flattened,\r\nribbon-like bodies, with thick walls, broadly rounded at the end, lying\r\nside by side and extending to the hinder end of the mesothorax. In\r\n_Anisomorpha buprestoides_ the glands are of the same size and shape\r\n(Scudder). In _Diapheromera femorata_ the repugnatorial foramina are\r\nvery minute, and the apparatus within consists of a pair of small\r\nobovate or subfusiform sacs, one on each side of the prothorax, about 1\r\nmm. in length, with a short and very slender duct opening externally at\r\nthe bottom of the pit (Scudder).\r\n\r\nIn the Mantidæ these seem to be genuine coxal glands, as there is a pair\r\nsituated between the coxæ of the first pair of legs. An evaginable organ\r\nlike a wart, with a glandular appearance, occurs on the hind femora of\r\nthe Acrydiidæ in a furrow on the under side, into which the tibia fits,\r\nabout one-fourth from the base (Psyche, iii, p. 32).\r\n\r\nIn the male cricket, the anal odoriferous glands are small lobes opening\r\ninto a reservoir on each side of the rectum (Dufour). Homologous glands\r\nalso occur in the Coleoptera (Fig. 302, _l_ and 317, _s_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 361.—Glands (_g_) of Lachnus; _h_, “honey” wart.—Gissler _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost Hemiptera or bugs send out a fœtid or nauseous odor due to a fluid\r\nsecreted by a single or double yellow or red pear-shaped gland, situated\r\nin the middle of the mesothoracic segment, and opening between the\r\nhinder or third pair of coxæ. In Belostoma Leidy describes these glands\r\nas consisting of two rather long cœcal tubes situated in the metathorax,\r\nbeneath the other viscera, extending backwards into the abdomen, and\r\nopening between the coxæ of the third pair of legs. Locy states that the\r\nsmell arising from these glands is pleasant, resembling that of well\r\nripened pears or bananas. Other bugs, moreover, emit an agreeable odor,\r\nthat of Syromastes resembling that of a fine bergamot pear. (Siebold.)\r\nThe fluid given out by the European fire-bug (_Pyrrhocoris apterus_) has\r\na sweetish smell, like ether. In the nymph there are three pairs of\r\ndorsal glands, on abdominal segments 2–5, which are atrophied in the\r\nmature insect. In the bed-bug, the nymph has three odoriferous glands\r\neach with paired openings in the three basal abdominal segments\r\nrespectively, and situated on the median dorsal line, being arranged\r\ntransversely at the edge of the tergites; but after the last moult these\r\nare aborted, and replaced by the sternal metathoracic glands (Künckel).\r\nGissler has detected a pair of glands in _Lachnus strobi_ (Fig. 361).\r\n\r\n=Anal glands of beetles.=—Certain beetles are endowed with eversible\r\nrepugnatorial glands. _Eleodes gigantea_ and _E. dentipes_ of both sexes\r\nare said by Gissler to possess these glands. When teased “they stand on\r\ntheir anterior and middle legs, holding the abdomen high up and spurting\r\nthe contents of the glands right and left.” The glands (Fig. 366, 1) are\r\ntwo reddish brown, somewhat bilobed sacs, and extend from the base of\r\nthe last up to the middle of the 2d abdominal segment, with an average\r\nlength of 6.5 mm. The liquid stains the human skin, has an acid\r\nreaction, with a peculiar, “intensely penetrant odor, causing the eye to\r\nlachrymate. It is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. Boiled with\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid and alcohol an ethereal aromatic vapor is\r\nproduced, indicating the presence of one or more organic acids, though\r\nneither formic or acetic acid could be detected.” Williston has observed\r\nthe same habits in seven other species of Eleodes, all ejecting a\r\npungent vile-smelling liquid, one species (_E. longicollis_) ejecting a\r\nstream of fluid from the anal gland, backwards sometimes to the distance\r\nof 10 cm. or more, and he regards these beetles as “the veritable skunks\r\nof their order.” Leidy briefly describes the odoriferous glands of _Upis\r\npennsylvanica_.\r\n\r\nThe anal glands consist, according to Meckel and also Dufour, of two\r\nlong, simple, flexuous cœca with reservoirs having two short excretory\r\nducts situated near the anus (Siebold).\r\n\r\nGlands like those of Eleodes found in _Blaps mortisaga_ are described in\r\ndetail by Gilson (Fig. 366, 2). They form two pouches or cuticular\r\ninvaginations situated in the end of the abdomen on the sides of the end\r\nof the intestine and unite on the median line underneath the genital\r\norgans, forming a very short tube with a chitinous wall, continuous with\r\nthe cuticle of the last abdominal segment. Into each pouch open a large\r\nnumber of fine slender lobules varying in shape, giving a villous aspect\r\nto the surface. These lobules are composed of as many as fifty\r\nunicellular glands, each of which is composed of four parts: (1) A\r\nradiated vesicle, (2) a central sac, giving rise (3) to a fine excretory\r\ntube, and (4) a sheath near the origin of the excretory tube. These are\r\nall modifications of the cytoplasm of the cell with its reticulum; the\r\nnucleus with its chromosomes is also present, but situated on one side\r\nof the central sac. The fine excretory tubules form a bundle passing\r\ndown into the mouth of each lobule.\r\n\r\n  Similar glands, though usually smaller, which have not been\r\n  carefully examined, occur in Carabus (Fig. 300, 3) and Cychrus,\r\n  which eject from the vent a disagreeable fluid containing butyric\r\n  acid (Pelouse). The bombardier beetle Brachinus, with its anal\r\n  glands, ejects a jet of bluish vapor accompanied with a considerable\r\n  explosion, which colors the human skin rust red; it is caustic,\r\n  smells like nitrous acid, and turns blue paper red. Westwood states\r\n  that individuals of a large South American Brachinus on being seized\r\n  “immediately began to play off their artillery, burning and staining\r\n  the flesh to such a degree that only a few specimens could be\r\n  captured with the naked hand, leaving a mark which remained for a\r\n  considerable time.” The fluid ejected by another species, in\r\n  Tripoli, blackened the fingers of the collector. “It is neither\r\n  alkaline nor acid, and it is soluble in water and in alcohol.”\r\n  (Kirby and Spence, iv, p. 149.)\r\n\r\n  Species of other genera (Agonum, Pheropsophus, Galerita, Helluo,\r\n  Paussus, Ozæna) are also bombardiers, though less decidedly so than\r\n  Brachinus. A Paussid beetle (Cerapterus) ejects explosively a fluid\r\n  containing free iodine (Loman), while Staphylinus, Stenus, Ocypus\r\n  olens, Lacon, etc., have similar anal fœtid glands, the liquid being\r\n  more or less corrosive. The secretion of _Mormolyce phyllodes_ is so\r\n  corrosive that it is said to paralyze the fingers for 24 hours\r\n  after. (Cuénot.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 362.—Median section through the femoro-tibial joint of leg of\r\n    Coccinella, showing at _o_ the opening through which the blood oozes\r\n    out; _f_, femur; _t_, tibia; _e_, extensor muscle of the tibia: _s_,\r\n    sinew of the same; at _ch_, chitinized; _h_, articular membrane;\r\n    _v_, tibial process.—After Lutz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe two pairs of remarkably large, soft, eversible, forked,\r\norange-yellow glands of the European genus Malachius, are thrust out\r\nfrom the side of the 1st and the 3d thoracic segments. They are everted\r\nby blood-pressure, and retracted by muscles. The larva of _Hydrophilus\r\npiceus_ ejects by the anus a black, fœtid fluid.\r\n\r\nClaus has shown that the larva of _Lina populi_ and other Chrysomelidæ\r\npossess numerous minute, eversible glands in each of the warts on the\r\nupper surface of the body, each gland containing a whitish, repellent\r\nfluid smelling like the oil of bitter almonds and containing salicylic\r\nacid derived from its food-plant, which issues as pearl-like drops.\r\nCandèze thinks the fluid may contain prussic acid. The fluid is secreted\r\nby a variable number of glandular cells, each provided with an efferent\r\nduct. The larvæ of saw-flies, notably _Cimbex americana_, also eject\r\ndroplets of a clear fluid from non-evaginable glands situated near each\r\nstigma (Chlolodkovsky).\r\n\r\n=The blood as a repellent fluid.=—In this connection it may be mentioned\r\nthat though there are no special glands present, many beetles emit drops\r\nof blood from the femoro-tibial joints of their legs as a means of\r\ndefence. Such are the oil-beetles (Meloë), Cantharis, Lytta. The\r\ncantharadine secreted by these beetles, according to Beauregard, is an\r\nefficient means of defence, as birds, reptiles, and carnivorous insects\r\nwill not usually attack them. This substance is formed in the blood and\r\nalso in the genital organs, and is so extremely caustic that scavenger\r\ninsects which feed upon their dead bodies will leave untouched the parts\r\ncontaining cantharadine, and if May-beetles or mole-crickets are washed\r\nwith the blood of Meloë or with cantharidate of potassa, it will for\r\nseveral days render them safe from the attacks of the carabids which\r\nusually prey upon them. The eggs even after deposition are strongly\r\nvesicant, and are thus free from the attacks of egg-eating insects\r\n(Cuénot). The Coccinellidæ are also protected by a yellow, mucilaginous,\r\ndisagreeable fluid oozing out of the ends of the femora; in our common,\r\ntwo-spotted lady-bird (_C. bipunctata_) the yellow fluid is\r\ndisagreeable, smelling like opium. Lutz has found that the blood in\r\nCoccinellidæ passes out through a minute opening situated at the end of\r\neach femur (Fig. 362). The blood is very repellent to insectivorous\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe Dyticidæ eject from the anus a colorless, disagreeable fluid, while\r\nthese beetles, and especially the Gyrinidæ, when captured send out a\r\nmilky fluid which appears to issue from the joints of the body. The\r\nSilphidæ throw out both from the mouth and vent a fœtid liquid with an\r\nammoniacal odor. They possess but a single anal gland, the reservoir\r\nopening on one side of the rectum (Dufour).\r\n\r\nOther malodorous insects have not yet been investigated; such are the\r\nvery persistent odors of lace-winged flies (Chrysopa).\r\n\r\nMore agreeable secretions, but probably formed by similar glands, is the\r\nodor of rose or hyacinth given out by Cicindelæ, or the rose fragrance\r\nexhaled by the European _Aromia moschata_.\r\n\r\n=Eversible glands of caddis-worms and caterpillars.=—Gilson, while\r\ninvestigating the segmentally disposed thoracic glands of larval\r\nTrichoptera, has found in the larva of _Limnophilus flavicornis_ that\r\nthe sternal prothoracic tubercle gives exit to an underlying tubular\r\ngland. In _Phryganea grandis_ each thoracic sternum affords an exit to\r\nan eversible gland. Many caterpillars, as our subjoined list will show,\r\nare very well protected by eversible repugnatorial glands situated\r\neither in the under or upper side of the body. Since the time of De Geer\r\n(1750) the fork-tailed larva of Cerura has been known to throw out a\r\nsecretion, which was described by Bonnet in 1755 as a true acid, sharp,\r\nsour, and biting. This spraying apparatus in _Cerura (Harpyia) vinula_\r\nhas been well described by Klemensiewicz (Fig. 366, 4), though Rengger\r\nin 1817 noticed the general form of the secretory sac, and that it opens\r\nout in two muscular eversible tubes, out of which the secretion is\r\nejected.\r\n\r\nThe fork-tailed larva of _Macrurocampa marthesia_, which is much like\r\nthat of Cerura, when teased sends out a jet of spray to the distance of\r\nnearly an inch from each side of the neck. While examining the very\r\ngayly-colored and heavily-spined caterpillars of _Schizura concinna_ we\r\nobserved that when a fully-grown one was roughly seized with the forceps\r\nor fingers it sent out a shower of spray from each side of the\r\nprothoracic segment, exactly like that of Cerura and Macrurocampa.\r\n\r\nIn the European _Cerura vinula_ the apparatus consists of a single sac,\r\nwhich opens by a narrow transverse slit on the under side of the neck,\r\nout of which is rapidly everted four lateral tubes, two on each side\r\n(Fig. 366, 4, _t_), which are withdrawn within the opening by the\r\ncontraction of several fine muscles. The apparatus in the American _C.\r\nmultiscripta_ is as in the European _C. vinula_. In a living specimen\r\nthe large secretory sac was seen to be of the same size and shape as in\r\nMacrurocampa, and of the color of raw silk. The sac when distended\r\nextends back to a little behind the middle pair of legs, and is nearly\r\ntwo-thirds as wide as the body. The caterpillar sent out the fluid when\r\nhandled, but we could not make it spray.\r\n\r\nIn the larva of _Macrurocampa marthesia_ the cervical or secretory gland\r\n(Fig. 366, 5) is situated in the 1st and 2d thoracic segments, extending\r\nto the hinder edge of the latter and lying between the nervous cord and\r\nthe œsophagus and proventriculus, and when empty the bulk of it lies a\r\nlittle to one side of the median line of the body. It is partly held in\r\nplace by small tracheæ, one quite large branch being sent to it from\r\nnear the prothoracic spiracle. The short, large duct, leading from it to\r\nthe transverse opening in the membrane between the head and prothoracic\r\nsegment, is a little narrower than this opening, and is kept distended\r\nby tænidia, or a series of short, spiral threads which are pale, not\r\nhoney-yellowish, in color. This duct lies on one side of the prothoracic\r\nganglion, resting just under the commissures passing up to the brain; it\r\nis also situated between the two silk ducts.\r\n\r\nThe very distensible sac (Fig. 366, 5) is rendered elastic by a curious\r\narrangement of the cuticle, the tænidia of the duct itself being\r\nrepresented by very thickly-scattered, irregular, separate, sinuous,\r\nchitinous ridges, which stand up from the cuticular lining of the wall\r\nof the sac (Fig. 366, 6). The secretory cells of the walls of this sac\r\nin _Cerura vinula_ are said by Klemensiewicz to be large hexagonal\r\ncells, resembling those of silk-glands, having like them large branched\r\nnuclei.\r\n\r\nThe fluid thrown out is said by Poulton to be formic acid; it causes\r\nviolent effervescence when allowed to fall upon sodium-bicarbonate, and\r\ncolors blue litmus paper red. It also appears from the researches of\r\nLatter that these creatures in the imago state secrete free potassium\r\nhydroxid, a substance for the first time known to exist in the animal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the caterpillar of _Astyanax archippus_ (_Limenitis disippus_) a\r\ndark, bladder-like sac is everted, but the lateral tubes appear to be\r\nwanting, and no spray is sent out; it occurs in the larvæ of many\r\nNymphalidæ and other butterflies and moths.\r\n\r\nThese glands are functionally active in Perophora, but obsolete (at\r\nleast the external openings) in Lacosoma.\r\n\r\n=The osmeterium in Papilio larvæ.=—The caterpillars of the swallowtailed\r\nbutterflies (Papilio, Doritis, and Thais), as is well known, when\r\nirritated thrust out from a transverse slit on the upper part of the\r\nprothoracic segment a large orange-yellow V-shaped fleshy tubular\r\nprocess (the osmeterium), from which is diffused a more or less\r\nmelonlike but disagreeable, in some cases insufferable, odor; the\r\nsecretion is acid and reddens litmus paper. The mechanism has been\r\ndescribed and figured by Klemensiewicz.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, or retracted, the osmeterium lies in the upper part of the\r\nbody in the three thoracic segments, and is crossed obliquely by several\r\nmuscular bundles attached to the walls of the body, and by the action of\r\nthese muscles the evagination of the osmeterium is strongly promoted.\r\nAfter eversion the tubes are slowly retracted by two slender muscles\r\ninserted at the end of each fork or tube, and arising from the sides of\r\nthe 3d segment behind the head, crossing each other in the median line\r\n(Fig. 366, 7 _r.m._). The secretion is formed by an oval mass of\r\nglandular cells at the base of the forks; in the glandular mass is a\r\nfurrow-like depression about which the secretory cells are grouped. The\r\nsecretion collects in very fine drops on the side of each furrow\r\nopposite the glandular cells.\r\n\r\nAccording to C. D. Ash the larva of an Australian Notodontid (_Danima\r\nbanksii_ Lewin) protrudes from the under side of the prothoracic segment\r\na Y-shaped red organ like that of Papilio; no fluid or odor is given\r\nout.\r\n\r\n=Dorsal and lateral eversible metameric sacs in other larvæ.=—The showy\r\ncaterpillars of Orgyia and its allies have a conspicuous coral-red\r\ntubercle on the back of the 6th and also the 7th abdominal segment,\r\nwhich on irritation are elongated, the end of the tubercles being\r\neversible. When at rest the summit is crateriform, but on eversion the\r\nend becomes rounded and conical. These osmeteria are everted by blood\r\npressure, and retracted by a muscle. Fig. 366, 9, represents a section\r\nof an osmeterium of _Orgyia leucostigma_ when retracted by the muscle\r\n(_m_); at the bottom of the crater are the secreting or glandular cells\r\n(_gc_), being modified hypodermal cells. These doubtless serve as\r\nterrifying organs to ichneumons and other insect enemies, and though we\r\nhave been unable to detect any odor emanating from the tubercles, yet\r\npossibly they give out a scent perceived by and disagreeable to their\r\ninsect assailants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 363.—Freshly hatched larva of _Hyperchiria io_, with its two\r\n    pairs of eversible glands (_g_).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 364.—Young larva of _Megalopyge crispata_, enlarged, showing the\r\n    seven pairs of lateral processes (_lp_): _sp_, spiracle; _abl′_,\r\n    _abl^6_, six pairs of abdominal legs besides the anal pair.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Hemileucidæ there is a pair of lateral osmeteria, on the 1st and\r\non the 7th abdominal segments, which however, are not highly colored\r\n(Figs. 363, 366, 10). In Megalopyge (Lagoa, Fig. 364) there is a lateral\r\nrow of singular pale permanently everted processes which appear to be\r\nthe homologues of the osmeteria of larvæ of other lepidopterous\r\nfamilies. As these are repeated on seven segments, their metameric\r\narrangement is obvious. The relation of these curious glands to the\r\nviscera is seen in Fig. 297, _lgp_, and their minute structure in Fig.\r\n365.\r\n\r\n  At _A_, the lumen (_l_) is a deep narrow cavity, with the secretion\r\n  (_secr._), collected at the mouth of the cavity, composed of a thin,\r\n  mucus-like, coagulated fluid, containing granules of varying degrees\r\n  of fineness, which take the stain readily. Outside of these are\r\n  collected fine nuclei (_bc_), stained dark, and enveloped in a\r\n  slight, transparent, pale, protoplasmic envelope, which may be blood\r\n  corpuscles. The glandular cells themselves are simply modified\r\n  hypodermal cells, as seen at _C_. In some of the nuclei, indistinct\r\n  nucleoli are seen, and deeply stained granules, especially around\r\n  the periphery of the nuclei. At _B_ is represented a section on one\r\n  side of the middle, but still showing the spacious lumen. In the\r\n  section represented by _C_, the knife passed through the process\r\n  still nearer the outer edge, and near the base; at _C^1_, three of\r\n  the glandular cells, with their large, deeply stained nuclei, are\r\n  drawn. A transverse section at _D_ shows the large lumen or cavity\r\n  (_l_).\r\n\r\n  As to the function and homologies of these structures, it is\r\n  difficult to decide. We have never noticed that they give off any\r\n  odor, though they may prove to be repugnatorial; they are not\r\n  visible in the fully grown, living insect, being concealed by the\r\n  long, dense hairs clothing the body; they are not spraying organs,\r\n  as they are imperforate at the end, not ending as the lateral,\r\n  eversible glands of _Hyperchiria io_, etc., in a crateriform\r\n  orifice.\r\n\r\n  They may be permanently everted glands, or osmeteria, which have, by\r\n  disuse, lost their power of retraction and their crateriform\r\n  opening, as well as the power of secreting a malodorous fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 365.—Section of lateral processes of larva of Megalopyge.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn certain of the butterflies, the Heliconidæ (Colænis, Heliconius,\r\nEuides, and Dione), there is thrust from the end of the abdomen a pair\r\nof large, irregular, rounded, eversible glands, which give out a\r\ndisagreeable odor, and are consequently repellent, and which seem to be\r\nthe homologues of the odoriferous glands of other butterflies.\r\n\r\n  The large, soft, rounded, eversible glands, looking like puff-balls\r\n  or a rounded pudding (Fig. 366, 12), are everted, when the\r\n  butterflies are roughly seized, from the dorsal side of the\r\n  penultimate segment of the abdomen. The males possess two smaller\r\n  tubercles on the inside of the anal claspers or lobes. Müller also\r\n  detected, in the females of various species of the Heliconidæ\r\n  enumerated above, a pair of club-shaped processes like the balancers\r\n  of flies, which are thrust out on each side of and under the\r\n  odoriferous puff-balls of the hinder edge of the penultimate segment\r\n  (Fig. 366, 13). The club or head is armed with hairs or bristles,\r\n  which, in Heliconius, are like the scales of a butterfly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 366.—Scent-glands of insects: 1.

Odoriferous glands (_ogl_) in the pupa\r\n    of _Vanessa io_: _r_, rectum; _h_, the folds of hypodermis which\r\n    forms the terminal papilla of the abdomen; _ov_, oviduct.—After\r\n    Jackson.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the caterpillars of certain blue butterflies (Lycænidæ) is an\r\ninternal osmeterium, being a very minute sac which is everted from a\r\ntransverse slit on the top of the 7th abdominal segment. Its function is\r\nquite the opposite of those of the caterpillars of other families, since\r\nthe sac exudes a sweet fluid very attractive to ants, which may be\r\ndiffused more widely by the delicate spinulose bristles crowning the\r\nsummit. W. H. Edwards states that in several species of Lycæna, besides\r\nthat on the 7th abdominal segment, there is on the 8th segment a pair of\r\nminute dorsal evaginable tubercles.\r\n\r\nA pair of small ramose odoriferous glands are said by Siebold, who\r\nregarded them as alluring glands, to occur in Argynnis, Melitæa, and\r\nZygæna, to be situated near the orifice of the oviduct, and Scudder has\r\ndetected them near the anus of the female pupa of _Danais archippus_.\r\nThe appearance of the odoriferous glands in the pupa of _Vanessa io_ is\r\nwell shown by Jackson (Fig. 366, 14). They develop as two tubular\r\ningrowths of the hypodermis, perfectly distinct one from the other, each\r\nhaving its own separate aperture to the exterior. In Fig. 366, 14 the\r\ncondition of parts is nearly as in the imago, the glands being situated\r\nbelow the rectum and opening of the oviduct. In both sexes of another\r\nBrazilian butterfly (_Didonis biblis_) on the median line of the abdomen\r\nbetween the 4th and 5th segments are two roundish vesicles covered with\r\nshort gray hairs, which emit a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that the dark-green fluid in Parnassius, secreted by\r\n  an evaginable gland, and which is moulded into shape by the\r\n  scimetar-shaped peraplast (Scudder), is formed by the homologues of\r\n  the anal glands of other butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Distribution of repugnatorial or alluring scent-glands in insects[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _A._ LARVAL INSECTS\r\n\r\n_a._ _Each thoracic segment; sternal.

He pointed out that the seat of the\r\nodor is the androconia (see p. 199), while either repellent or pleasant\r\nodors are exhaled from abdominal glands.\r\n\r\n  Those of _Pieris napi_ yield a scent like that of citrons, _Didonis\r\n  biblis_ gives off three different odors from different parts of the\r\n  body, besides having a distinctly odorous spot on the hind wings.\r\n  Both sexes have a sac between the fourth and fifth abdominal\r\n  segments which exhales a very unpleasant (protective) odor, while\r\n  the males have on the succeeding segment a pair of glands from which\r\n  proceeds an agreeable odor like that of the heliotrope. _Callidryas\r\n  argante_ throws off a musky odor. In _Prepona laertes_ the odor is\r\n  like that of a bat, in _Dircenna xantho_ it is vanilla-like, the\r\n  androconia being situated on the front edge of the hind wings. In\r\n  _Papilio grayi_ the odor is said to be as agreeable and intense as\r\n  in flowers. Certain sphingids are known to exhale a distinct odor,\r\n  which Müller has traced to a tuft of hair-like scales at the base of\r\n  the abdomen, and which fits into a groove in the first segment, so\r\n  as to be ordinarily invisible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 367._—Scent-tufts: 1, of _Leucarctia acræa_; 2, of _Pyrrarctia\r\n    isabella_.—After Smith.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the noctuid genus, Patula, the costal half of the hind wing is\r\n  modified to form a large scent-gland, and in consequence the\r\n  venation has been modified. The still greater distortion of the\r\n  veins in the allied genus, Argida, was attributed by the author to\r\n  its once having possessed a similar scent-gland, now become\r\n  rudimentary by disuse. (Hampson.)\r\n\r\n  Peculiar white or orange-colored, hairy, thread-like processes have\r\n  been found protruding from narrow openings near the tip of the\r\n  abdomen of Arctian moths (Fig. 367), which throw off, according to\r\n  J. B. Smith, “an intense odor, somewhat like the smell of laudanum.”\r\n  We have perceived the same unpleasant odor emanating from the males\r\n  of _Spilosoma virginica_ and _Arctia virgo_, as well as _Leucarctia\r\n  acræa_.\r\n\r\n  We are informed by C. Dury that similar but longer hairy appendages\r\n  are thrust out by the male of _Haploa clymene_. Many glaucopid moths\r\n  protrude similar glandular processes. Thus Müller tells us that on\r\n  seizing a glaucopid female by the wings, nearly the whole body\r\n  became enveloped in a large cloud of snow-white wool which came out\r\n  of a sort of pouch on the ventral side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n  The male of a glaucopid was seen to dart out a pair of long hollow\r\n  hairy retractile filaments which in some species exceed the whole\r\n  body in length. The apparatus secretes a peculiar odor, probably\r\n  serving to allure the female (Nature), and certain Zygænidæ have on\r\n  the inner side of the paranal lobes (Afterklappen) glands filled\r\n  with a sweetly scented fluid. Smith has detected a peculiar brush of\r\n  hair-like scales in a groove between the dorsal and ventral parts of\r\n  the basal two segments of the abdomen of _Schinia marginata_ (family\r\n  Noctuidæ), and when removed it exhaled a laudanum-like smell.\r\n\r\n  The pupa of _Citheronia regalis_ gives out from the end of the\r\n  abdomen a scent reminding us of laudanum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 368.—Scent-tufts on middle legs of _Catocala concumbens_.—After\r\n    Bailey.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother mode of disseminating pleasant, alluring odors is that of the\r\nmales of certain moths, which bear pencils and tufts on their fore or\r\nhind legs, and in the case of an Indian butterfly on the greatly\r\nelongated palpi. Those on the legs are ordinarily concealed in cavities\r\nor furrows in the leg, and may be thrust out and expanded so as to\r\nwidely diffuse their odor. Such are those of the males of Catocala (Fig.\r\n368), which resemble an artist’s fitch brush. In _Hepialus hecta_, where\r\nthe arrangements for protecting the tufts are quite abnormal, Bertkau\r\nhas detected the cells which secrete the odorous fluid. In the male of\r\nanother Hepialus (_H. humuli_) a peculiar scent proceeds from the\r\ncuriously aborted and altered hind tibiæ. (Barrett.) In one case, that\r\nof a geometrid moth (_Bapata dichroa_ of New Guinea), these pencils\r\noccur on all the legs. (Haase). In many species a distinct odor is\r\nperceptible when the leg bearing the pencil or tuft is crushed.\r\n\r\nThese eversible scent-glands have been supposed to be mostly restricted\r\nto the Lepidoptera, and to a single known case in the Trichoptera, but\r\nsimilar alluring male glands also occur in the Orthoptera (Locustidæ).\r\nH. Garman has described and figured in the cave cricket (_Hadenœcus\r\nsubterraneus_) “a pair of white fleshy appendages protruding from slits\r\nbetween the terga of the 9th and 10th abdominal somites, the nature of\r\nwhich is not clear,” adding, “the slits through which the organs appear\r\nare situated one on each side anterior to and a little within the cerci.\r\nWhen fully protruded, the glands are white, cylindrical, a little\r\ntapering, and are about one-eighth of an inch long.” He believes that\r\nthey are protruded during the period of sexual excitement, and suggests\r\nthat “the sense of smell is certainly the one best calculated to bring\r\nthe sexes together in the darkness of caves.” We had previously noticed\r\nthese organs in alcoholic specimens, but supposed that they were fungous\r\ngrowths. On dissecting and making microscopic sections of them, the\r\ngland is, when extended (Fig. 369), seen to be a long, ensiform, sharp,\r\nband-like process, with numerous retractor muscular fibres.

This\r\ndiscovery was extended by Straus-Dürckheim, who discovered the\r\ncontractile and valvular structures of the heart. It is noteworthy that\r\nboth Cuvier and Dufour denied that any circulation, except of air,\r\nexisted in insects; and so great an anatomist as Lyonet doubted whether\r\nthe dorsal vessel was a genuine heart, though he pointed out the fact\r\nthat there are no arteries and veins connected with this vessel. Another\r\nFrench anatomist, Marcel de Serres, thought that the dorsal vessel was\r\nmerely the secreting organ of the fat-body.\r\n\r\n  The so-called peritracheal circulation claimed by Blanchard and by\r\n  Agassiz has been shown by McLeod to be an anatomical impossibility,\r\n  the view having first been refuted by Joly in 1849.\r\n\r\n  Except the aorta-like continuation in the thorax and head which\r\n  divides into two short branches, there are, with slight exceptions\r\n  (p. 405), no distinct arteries, such as are to be found in the\r\n  lobster and other Crustacea, and no great collective veins, such as\r\n  exist in Crustacea and in Limulus. This is probably the result of a\r\n  reduction by disuse in the circulatory system, since in myriopods\r\n  (Julidæ and Scolopendridæ) lateral arteries are said to diverge near\r\n  the ostia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _a._ The heart\r\n\r\nThe heart or “dorsal vessel” is a delicate, pulsating tube, situated\r\njust under the integument of the back, in the median line of the body,\r\nand above the digestive canal. It can be partially seen without\r\ndissection in caterpillars. It is covered externally and lined within by\r\nmembranes which are probably elastic; and between these two membranes\r\nextends a system of delicate muscular fibres, which generally have a\r\ncircular course, but sometimes cross each other. The heart is divided by\r\nconstrictions into chambers, separated by valvular folds. The internal\r\nlining membrane referred to forms the valvular folds separating the\r\nchambers. Each of these chambers has, at the anterior end, on each side,\r\na valvular orifice (Fig. 370, ostium, _i_) which can be inwardly closed.\r\n\r\n  Miall and Denny thus describe the different layers of the wall of\r\n  the heart of the cockroach:\r\n\r\n  “There are: (1) a transparent, structureless intima, only visible\r\n  when thrown into folds; (2) a partial endocardium, of scattered,\r\n  nucleated cells, which passes into the interventricular valves; (3)\r\n  a muscular layer, consisting of close-set, annular, and distant,\r\n  longitudinal fibres. The annular muscles are slightly interrupted at\r\n  regular and frequent intervals, and are imperfectly joined along the\r\n  middle line above and below, so as to indicate (what has been\r\n  independently proved) that the heart arises as two half-tubes, which\r\n  afterwards join along the middle. Elongate nuclei are to be seen\r\n  here and there among the muscles. The adventitia (4), or connective\r\n  tissue layer, is but slightly developed in the adult cockroach.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 370.—Part of the heart of _Lucanus cervus_: _a_, the posterior\r\n    chambers (the anterior ones are covered by a part of the ligaments\r\n    which hold the heart in place); _i_, auriculo-ventricular openings;\r\n    _g_, _g_, the lateral muscles fixed by the prolongations _h_, _h_,\r\n    to the upper side of the abdomen.—After Straus-Dürckheim.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGraber says that the heart of insects may be regarded not as an organ\r\n_de novo_, but only as the somewhat modified contractile dorsal vessel\r\nof the annelids, in which, however, the transverse arteries arising on\r\neach side became, with the gradual development of the tracheæ,\r\nsuperfluous and finally abortive. He describes it as a muscular tube\r\ncomposed of very delicate annular fibres, which within and without is\r\ncovered by a relatively homogeneous, strong, elastic membrane.\r\n\r\n  The division into separate chambers is effected by means of a\r\n  folding inwards and forwards of the entire muscular wall. “A portion\r\n  of each side of the heart is first extended inwards so as very\r\n  nearly to meet a corresponding portion from the opposite side, and\r\n  then, being reflected backwards, forms, according to Straus\r\n  (Consid., etc., p. 356), the interventricular valve which separates\r\n  each chamber from that which follows it. Posteriorly to this valve,\r\n  at the anterior part of each chamber, is a transverse opening or\r\n  slit (Fig. 371, _b_), the _auriculo-ventricular orifice_, through\r\n  which the blood passes into each chamber, and immediately behind it\r\n  is a second, but much smaller, _semilunar valve_ (_c_), which, like\r\n  the first, is directed forwards into the chamber. It is between\r\n  these two valves on each side that the blood passes into the heart,\r\n  and is prevented from returning by the closing of the semilunar\r\n  valve. When the blood is passing into the chamber, the\r\n  interventricular valve is thrown back against the side of the\r\n  cavity, but is closed when, by the contraction of the transverse\r\n  fibres, the diameter of each chamber is narrowed, and the blood is\r\n  forced along into the next chamber.” (Newport.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 371.—A, heart of _Lucanus cervus_: _a_, valves or chambers;\r\n    _bb_, alary muscles; _c_, supposed auricular space around the\r\n    heart. _B_, division into arteries of the end of the aorta in\r\n    larva of _Vanessa urticæ_. _C_, interior of the chamber, showing\r\n    the transverse fibres; _b_, auriculo-ventricular opening and valve\r\n    into the chambers; _c_, semilunar valve; _d_, interventricular\r\n    valve.—After Straus-Dürckheim, from Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 372.—Heart of Belostoma.—After Locy.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  According to Müller, there is but a single pair of ostia in Phasma,\r\n  and, in the larva of Corethra, the heart is a simple, unjointed\r\n  tube, not divided into chambers, and Viallanes states that, in the\r\n  very young larva of Musca, there are no ostia (Kolbe). In the larva\r\n  of Ptychoptera, Grobben found a short oval heart, with one pair of\r\n  ostia situated in the 6th abdominal segment; a long aorta proceeds\r\n  from it, the thoracic portion of which pulsates; from behind the\r\n  heart arises a pulsating pouch, which connects with the hinder\r\n  aorta, which does not pulsate, and ends at the base of two tracheal\r\n  gills. Burmeister was able to find only four pairs of openings in\r\n  the larva of Calosoma. Newport states that, while Straus figures\r\n  nine chambers in Melolontha, and, consequently, eight pairs of\r\n  openings, he has not been able to observe more than seven pairs of\r\n  openings in _Lucanus cervus_. He has invariably found eight pairs of\r\n  openings both in the larva and imago of _Sphinx ligustri_, as well\r\n  as in other Lepidoptera. According to Béla-Dezso, the number of\r\n  pairs of ostia corresponds to that of the pairs of stigmata.\r\n\r\n  There also occur, on each side of each chamber, two so-called\r\n  pear-shaped bodies which are separated from the tubular portion of\r\n  the heart itself, but, by means of muscular fibres, are united with\r\n  the chamber and with their valves. These pyriform bodies appear as\r\n  vesicles or cells with granular contents, besides some nuclei with\r\n  nucleoli. They are of very small size. According to the measurements\r\n  of Dogiel, in the larva of _Corethra plumicornis_, they are 0.02 to\r\n  0.1 mm. long, and 0.06 to 0.08 mm. broad. He regards these peculiar\r\n  bodies as apolar nerve-cells of the heart. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 373.—A, part of the heart of _Dyticus marginalis_, showing the\r\n    spiral arrangement of the muscular fibres; _c_, closed, _e_, open,\r\n    valve; _a_, dorsal diaphragm with interwoven muscular fibres; _b_,\r\n    arrangement of fibres, recalling the screw-like features of the\r\n    fibres of the human heart; _d_, narrow end. _B_, diagrammatic\r\n    figure of the valvular openings, with the terminal flap (_e_), and\r\n    the cellular valve, of a May beetle; _a_, valvular opening of a\r\n    dipterous larva, with the interventricular valve (_b_). _C_,\r\n    abdomen of a mole-cricket, ventral view; _c_, the segmented heart;\r\n    _a_, aorta; _b_, segmented diaphragm under it.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Besides the venous openings of the heart which open into the\r\n  pericardial region, Kowalevsky has discovered, in the heart of some\r\n  Orthoptera (Caloptenus, Locusta, etc.), five pairs of openings by\r\n  which the cardiac chambers receive the blood of the peri-intestinal\r\n  region. Graber had divided the cœlom of insects into three regions\r\n  (pericardial, peri-intestinal, and perineural regions), and hitherto\r\n  only a union of the heart with the pericardial region by slit-like\r\n  openings was known. These openings are symmetrically distributed on\r\n  five abdominal segments; each section of the heart in this region\r\n  has, therefore, four openings, which are all of a truly venous\r\n  nature. These openings, called cardio-cœlomic apertures, are visible\r\n  to the naked eye, being situated on conical papillæ of the walls of\r\n  the heart. These papillæ pass through the outer diaphragm, and open\r\n  into the peri-intestinal part of the cœlom, in the Acrydiidæ\r\n  directly, in the Locustidæ through special canals. The cells of the\r\n  papillæ are spongy, possessing large nuclei, and similar, as a\r\n  whole, to glandular cells. (Comptes rendus, cxix, 1894.)\r\n\r\n  The mechanism by which the ostia are closed consists, according to\r\n  Graber, of an ∞-shaped muscle passing around the two openings, and\r\n  which, being interlaced, is sufficient to close the openings. But\r\n  this is not all. The fore and hinder edge of the ostia project,\r\n  leaf-like, into the cavity of the heart, and thus form, with the\r\n  outer walls, two valves which, during the systole, filled with the\r\n  blood rushing in, not only hermetically close the lateral openings,\r\n  but also, by the simultaneous closure of the entire chamber by the\r\n  circular muscles in the middle of the same, the two valves,\r\n  simultaneously approaching each other, so nearly touch that they\r\n  form a transverse partition wall in the chamber. But, for the last\r\n  purpose, _i.e._ for the separation of the chambers from one another,\r\n  there is a very special contrivance. In the May beetle, we find,\r\n  besides a valve (Fig. 373, _B_, _e_), opening into the middle of the\r\n  chambers, a large, stalked cell (_d_), which, in the diastole,\r\n  _i.e._ in the expansion of the heart, hangs down free on the walls\r\n  of the heart; but, in the systole or contraction, like a cork,\r\n  closes the middle of the valve, but does not wholly close the\r\n  cavity. He has observed, in the larva of Corethra, formal,\r\n  interventricular valves, which also are not in the middle, but are\r\n  separated from one another in the interlaced ends. They consist of\r\n  two longitudinally membranous flaps which move against each other\r\n  like two valves (Fig. 373, _B_, _b_).\r\n\r\n  “But what is the necessity for such a complicated mechanism? All the\r\n  blood from behind passes into the heart, and, for its propulsion a\r\n  simple muscular tube, whose circular fibres would draw together and\r\n  contract it, would be thought to be sufficient. But the heart,\r\n  except in some larvæ, ends posteriorly in a blind sac, and the blood\r\n  can only pass into it by a series of pairs of lateral openings. Now,\r\n  as regards the reception and the propulsion of the blood forwards,\r\n  two modes are conceivable. The simplest way would be that the\r\n  tubular heart should, along its whole length, contract or expand;\r\n  that, moreover, the blood should be simultaneously sucked in through\r\n  all the openings, and that then, also, the contraction, or systole,\r\n  should take place in every part of the heart at the same moment. But\r\n  this would, plainly, in so long and thin-walled a vessel, be highly\r\n  impracticable, since, through such a manipulation, the mass of blood\r\n  enclosed in the heart would be crowded together rather than really\r\n  impelled forwards. Only the second case could be admissible, and\r\n  that is this, that each chamber pulsates, one after another, from\r\n  behind forwards. But, then, each segmental heart must be separated\r\n  from the others by a valve. To make the matter wholly clear, we may\r\n  observe an insect heart pulsating, and this is best seen in one of\r\n  its middle chambers. This chamber expands (simply by the relaxation\r\n  of its circular muscles), the ostia, also, consequently open, and a\r\n  given quantity of blood is drawn in from the pericardial cavity.\r\n  What now would happen after the succeeding contraction if there were\r\n  no valves between? The blood would not flow forwards, but seek a way\r\n  out backwards.\r\n\r\n  “But, in fact, the valve of the hinder chamber, at this time, closes\r\n  itself, while, by the simultaneous expansion of the anterior ones,\r\n  their door opens, and this section of the heart, at the same time,\r\n  causes a sucking in of the contents of the posterior chamber. This\r\n  phenomenon is repeated, in the same way, from chamber to chamber,\r\n  which also acts alternately as ventricle and auricle, or by a\r\n  sucking and pumping action. One is involuntarily reminded of the\r\n  ingenious manipulation by which, by the alternate opening and\r\n  shutting of the flood-gates, a vessel is carried along a canal.\r\n\r\n  “This wave-like motion of an insect’s heart also has the advantage\r\n  that, just before a pulse-wave has reached the chambers farthest in\r\n  front, the hinder ones are already prepared for the production of a\r\n  second, for, as a matter of fact, often 60, and even 100, and, in\r\n  very agile insects, 150, waves pass, in a single minute, through the\r\n  series of chambers, which make it very difficult to follow the\r\n  flowing of their waves.” (Graber.)\r\n\r\n  =The propulsatory apparatus.=—But the heart itself is only a part of\r\n  the entire propulsatorial apparatus to which belongs the following\r\n  contrivance, the nature of which has been worked out by Graber.\r\n\r\n  Under the dorsal vessel is stretched a sort of roof-like diaphragm,\r\n  _i.e._ a membrane, arched like the dorsal wall of the hind-body\r\n  which is attached, in a peculiar way, to the sides of the body. The\r\n  best idea can be gained by a cross-section through the entire body\r\n  (Fig. 374): _H_ is the true dorsal vessel; _S_, the diaphragm. A\r\n  surface view is seen at 373, _C_, _b_, where it appears as a plate\r\n  with the edge regularly curved outwards on each side. Its precise\r\n  mode of working is thus: from each dorsal band of the sides of the\r\n  abdomen arises a pair of muscles spreading out fan-like, and\r\n  extending to the heart, so that the fibres of one side pass directly\r\n  over to those of the other, often splitting apart, or, between the\r\n  two, extends outwards a perforated, thin web, like an elastic,\r\n  fibrous sheet (Fig. 373, _A_, _a_), with numerous perforations,\r\n  forming a diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 374.—Diagram of transverse section of pericardial sinus of\r\n    _Ædipoda cœrulescens_: _H_, heart; _s_, septum; _m_, muscles,—the\r\n    upper suspensory, the lower alary.—After Graber, from Sharp. (See\r\n    also Fig. 377.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Graber has thus explained the action of the pericardial diaphragm\r\n  and chamber, as freely translated by Miall and Denny: “When the\r\n  alary muscles contract, they depress the diaphragm, which is arched\r\n  upwards when at rest. A rush of blood towards the heart is thereby\r\n  set up, and the blood streams through the perforated diaphragm into\r\n  the pericardial chamber. Here it bathes a spongy or cavernous tissue\r\n  (the fat-cells), which is largely supplied with air-tubes, and\r\n  having been thus aerated, passes immediately forwards to the heart,\r\n  entering it at the moment of diastole, which is simultaneous with\r\n  the sinking of the diaphragm.”\r\n\r\n  In the cockroach, however, Miall and Denny think that the facts of\r\n  structure do not altogether justify this explanation: “The fenestræ\r\n  of the diaphragm are mere openings without valves. The descent of a\r\n  perforated non-valvular plate can bring no pressure to bear upon the\r\n  blood, for it is not contended that the alary muscles are powerful\r\n  enough to change the figure of the abdominal rings.... The diaphragm\r\n  appears to give mechanical support to the heart, resisting pressure\r\n  from a distended alimentary canal, while the sheets of fat-cells, in\r\n  addition to their proper physiological office, may equalize small\r\n  local pressures, and prevent displacement. The movement of the blood\r\n  towards the heart must (we think) depend, not upon the alary\r\n  muscles, but upon the far more powerful muscles of the abdominal\r\n  wall, and upon the pumping action of the heart itself.”\r\n\r\n  “The peculiar office,” says Graber, “performed by the heart has\r\n  already been stated. It is nothing more than a regulator; than an\r\n  organ for directing the blood in a determinate course in order that\r\n  this may not wholly stagnate, or only be the plaything of a force\r\n  acting in another way, as, for example, through that afforded by the\r\n  body-cavity and the inner digestive canal. At regular intervals a\r\n  portion of the blood is sucked through the same, and then by means\r\n  of the anterior supply tube it is pushed onward into the head,\r\n  whence it passes into the cavities of the tissues. The different\r\n  conditions of tension under which the mass of blood stands in the\r\n  different regions of the body then causes a farther circulation.\r\n  Besides this, the blood passes through separate smaller pumping\r\n  apparatuses, and through vessel-like modifications of cavities, also\r\n  through hollow spaces between the muscles, as, for example, in the\r\n  appendages where a regular backward and forward flow of the blood,\r\n  especially in the limbs, wings, antennæ, and certain abdominal\r\n  appendages takes place. Here and there may occasionally occur a\r\n  narrow place where the flow of blood is obstructed by the\r\n  accumulation of the blood corpuscles, causing a considerable\r\n  stagnation.” (Graber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 375.—_Libellula depressa_, opened from the back, showing the\r\n    nervous cord (_b_{1}_-_b_{3}_, thoracic, _h_{1}_-_h_{7}_, abdominal,\r\n    ganglia), also the furrow-like ventral sinus closed by a muscular\r\n    diaphragm.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 376.—_A_, part of the ventral furrow of _Libellula depressa_ more\r\n    highly magnified: _a_, a sternal plate (urite); _c_, the septum\r\n    stretched over it, at _s_ in a relaxed or collapsed state; _b_ and\r\n    _d_, the wing-like, sternal processes from which the muscular\r\n    bundles of the diaphragm arise. _B_, same in Acridium.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 377.—Diagrammatic section of the abdomen of _Acridium\r\n    tartaricum_, showing the ventral septum (_i_, _p_, _l_) contracted,\r\n    and (_i_, _k_, _l_) stretched out; _oh_, rib-like lateral processes\r\n    of the urite; _f_, ganglia; _b_, heart, with its suspensorium (_a_);\r\n    _c_, fat tissue in the pericardial tissue sinus; _d_, dorsal septum\r\n    or diaphragm contracted. _q_, extended; _g_, fat-body; _e_, muscular\r\n    part of diaphragm; _no_, expiration, _hm_, inspiration, muscle.—This\r\n    and Figs. 375, 376, after Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The supraspinal vessel.=—In many insects there is a ventral heart\r\nacting on the heart’s blood as an aspirator, or more correctly a ventral\r\nsinus lying on the nervous cord, and closed by a pulsating diaphragm.\r\nThis was discovered by Réaumur in the larva of a fly, and by Graber in\r\nthe dragon-fly and locusts (Acrydiidæ). A glance at Figs. 375 and 376\r\nwill save a long description. The ventral wall forms a furrow, and\r\nbetween its borders (Fig. 377, _e_) extends the diaphragm. During the\r\ncontraction of the muscles—and this, here, acts from before\r\nbackwards—the membrane rises up and makes a cavity for the blood, which\r\npasses backwards over the nervous cord. The dorsal and ventral sinuses\r\ntogether thus bring about a closed circulation.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the insects are well provided with the means of\r\ndistribution of their nutritive fluid, and that the blood is kept\r\ncontinually fresh and rich in oxygen. (Graber.)\r\n\r\n=The aorta.=—While the heart is mostly situated within the abdomen, it\r\nis continued into the thorax and the head as a simple, non-pulsating\r\ntube, called the aorta. In Sphinx the aorta, as described by Newport,\r\nbegins at the anterior part of the 1st abdominal segment, where it bends\r\ndownwards to pass under the metaphragma and enter the thorax; it then\r\nascends again between the great longitudinal dorsal muscles of the\r\nwings, and passes onwards until it arrives at the posterior margin of\r\nthe pronotum; it then again descends and continues its course along the\r\nupper surface of the œsophagus, with which it passes beneath the brain,\r\nin front of which and immediately above the pharynx, it divides into two\r\nbranches, each of which subdivides. Newport, however, overlooked a\r\nthoracic enlargement of the aorta called by Burgess the “aortal chamber”\r\n(Fig. 310, _a_, _c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 378.—_A_, last three abdominal segments and bases of the three\r\n    caudal processes of _Cloëon dipterum_: _r_, dorsal vessel; _kl_,\r\n    ostia; _k_, special terminal chamber of the dorsal vessel with its\r\n    entrance _a_; _b_, blood-vessel of the left caudal process. _B_,\r\n    26th joint of the left caudal appendage from below: _b_, a portion\r\n    of the blood-vessel; _o_, orifice in the latter.—After Zimmermann,\r\n    from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “In Sphinx and _Vanessa urticæ_, immediately after the aorta has\r\n  passed beneath the cerebrum, it gives off laterally two large\r\n  trunks, which are each equal in capacity to about one-third of the\r\n  main vessel. These pass one on each side of the head, and are\r\n  divided into three branches which are directed backwards, but have\r\n  not been traced farther in consequence of their extreme delicacy.\r\n  Anterior to these trunks are two smaller ones which appear to be\r\n  given to the parts of the mouth and antennæ, and nearer the median\r\n  line are two others which are the continuations of the aorta. These\r\n  pass upwards, and are lost in the integument. The whole of these\r\n  parts are so exceedingly delicate that we have not, as yet, been\r\n  able to follow them beyond their origin at the termination of the\r\n  aorta, but believe them to be continuous, with very delicate,\r\n  circulatory passages along the course of the tracheal vessels. It is\r\n  in the head alone that the aorta is divided into branches, since,\r\n  throughout its whole course from the abdomen, it is one continuous\r\n  vessel, neither giving off branches, nor possessing lateral muscles,\r\n  auricular orifices, or separate chambers.” (Newport, art. Insecta,\r\n  p. 978.)\r\n\r\nDogiel observed in the transparent larva of _Corethra plumicornis_ that\r\nthe aorta extends only to the hinder border of the brain. Here it\r\ndivides into two lamellæ, each of which independently extends farther\r\non. One lamella is seen under the brain and under the eye, the other\r\nreaches near the eye. The lamellæ are tied to the integument by threads.\r\nAt the point of division of the aorta is an opening. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  True blood-vessels appear to exist in the caudal appendages of the\r\n  May-flies, as the heart appears to divide and pass directly into\r\n  them (Fig. 378). The last chamber of the heart diminishes in size at\r\n  the end of the body, and then divides into three delicate tubular\r\n  vessels which pass into the three caudal appendages, and extend to\r\n  the end of each one, along the upper side. While the valves of the\r\n  heart, in all insects, are directed anteriorly because the blood\r\n  flows from behind, in the larva of the Ephemeridæ the valves of the\r\n  last chamber of the heart are directed backwards, because from this\r\n  chamber the blood flows in the opposite direction, _i.e._ into the\r\n  caudal appendages. During the contraction of the heart, the\r\n  elongated section of the same in the last abdominal segment receives\r\n  a part of the mass of blood contained in the last chamber, which is\r\n  driven by independent contractions into the caudal appendages. These\r\n  vessels have openings before the end through which the blood enters\r\n  into the cavity of the appendages, and can also pass back, in order\r\n  to be taken up by the body cavity. It is possible that these\r\n  blood-vessels stand in direct relation to respiration. (Zimmermann,\r\n  Creutzburg, in Kolbe, p. 544.)\r\n\r\n  =The pericardial cells.=—Along the heart, on both sides, occur the\r\n  so-called pericardial cells, which differ from the fat-cells, and\r\n  also the peritracheal cells of Frenzel, and are mostly arranged in\r\n  linear series, which have a close relation to the circulation of the\r\n  blood. In the larva of Chironomus, they lie in groups; in that of\r\n  Culex, they are arranged segmentally. In caterpillars, these\r\n  pericardial cells are not situated in the region of the heart, but\r\n  are arranged linearly on the side, and form a network of granulated\r\n  cells situated between the fat-bodies. Other rows of these cells are\r\n  situated near the stigmata and the main lateral tracheæ. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  According to Kowalevsky, the pericardial cells, and the\r\n  garland-shaped, cellular cord consist of cells, whose function it is\r\n  to purify the blood, and to remove the foreign or injurious matters\r\n  mingled with the blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 379.—Diagram of the circulatory organs in the head of the\r\n    cockroach, seen from above: _A_, ampulla; _V_, antennal vessel;\r\n    _M_, chief muscular cord; _m_, muscular band; _Bs_, wall of the\r\n    blood sinus; _am_, opening of the aorta (a); _rg_, anterior\r\n    sympathetic or visceral ganglion; _hg_, hinder visceral ganglion;\r\n    _F_, _F_, facetted eyes; _o_, vestigial ocellus; _G_, _G_, brain;\r\n    _S_, œsophagus.—After Pawlowa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  =Ampulla-like blood circulation in the head.=—In the head of the\r\n  cockroach occurs, according to Pawlowa, a contractile vascular sac\r\n  at the base of each antenna. The cavity has a valvular communication\r\n  with the blood space below and in front of the brain, and\r\n  muscle-fibres effect systole and diastole. Each sac is beyond doubt\r\n  an independently active part of the circulatory system. These organs\r\n  also occur in Locusta and other Acrydiidæ, and Selvatico has\r\n  described similar structures in _Bombyx mori_ and certain other\r\n  Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  =Pulsatile organs of the legs.=—Accessory to the circulation is a\r\n  special system of pulsatile organs in the three pairs of legs of\r\n  Nepidæ, generally situated in the tibia just below its articulation\r\n  with the femur, but in the fore legs of Ranatra, in the clasp-joint\r\n  or tarsus, just below its articulation with the tibia. First\r\n  observed by Behn (1835), Locy has studied the organ (Fig. 380) in\r\n  Corixa, Notonecta, Gerris, besides the Nepidæ. It is a whip-like\r\n  structure attached at both ends, with fibres extending upward and\r\n  backward to the integument of the leg, separate from the muscular\r\n  fibres and does not involve them in its motions, and is not affected\r\n  by the muscles themselves. “As the blood-corpuscles flow near the\r\n  pulsating body they move faster, and around the organ itself there\r\n  is a whirlpool of motion.” The beating of these organs aids the\r\n  circulation in both directions, and when the motion ceases, the\r\n  blood-currents in the legs stop; the rate of the pulsating organ is\r\n  always faster than that of the heart, and the action is automatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 380.—Pulsating organs in Hemiptera: _A_, Belostoma nymph, _B_,\r\n    legs of Corixa. _C_, Ranatra, adult, to show the exceptional\r\n    position of the pulsating organ in the fore legs. _D_, pulsatile\r\n    organ in tibia of Ranatra.—After Locy.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _b._ The blood\r\n\r\nThe blood of insects, as in other invertebrates, differs from that of\r\nthe higher animals in having no red corpuscles. It is a thin fluid, a\r\nmixture of blood (serum) and chyle, usually colorless, but sometimes\r\nyellowish or reddish, which contains pale amœboid corpuscles\r\ncorresponding to the white corpuscles (leucocytes) of the vertebrates,\r\nthough they are relatively less numerous in the blood of insects. The\r\nyellow fluid expelled from the joints of certain beetles (Coccinella,\r\nTimarcha, and the Meloidæ) is, according to Leydig, only the serum of\r\nthe blood. In phytophagous insects the blood is colored greenish by the\r\nchlorophyll set free during digestion. The blood of _Deilephila\r\neuphorbia_ is colored an intense olive-green, and that of _Cossus\r\nligniperda_ is pale yellow. (Urech.) The blood of case-worms\r\n(Trichoptera) is greenish. In some insects it is brownish or violet. The\r\nserum is the principal bearer of the coloring material, yet Graber has\r\nshown that in certain insects the corpuscles are more or less beset with\r\nbright yellow or red fat-globules, so as to give the same hue to the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n=The leucocytes.=—The corpuscles are usually elongated, oval, or\r\nflattened oat-shaped, with a rounded nucleus, or are often amœbiform;\r\nand they are occasionally seen undergoing self-division. When about to\r\ndie the corpuscles become amœbiform or star-shaped. (Cattaneo.) Their\r\nnumber varies with the developmental stage of the insect, and in larvæ\r\nincreases as they grow, becoming most abundant shortly before pupation.\r\nThe blood diminishes in quantity in the pupal stage, and becomes still\r\nless abundant in the imago. (Landois.) The quantity also varies with the\r\nnutrition of the insect, and after a few days’ starvation nearly all the\r\nblood is absorbed. Crystals may be obtained by evaporating a drop of the\r\nblood without pressure; they form radiating clusters of pointed needles.\r\nThe freshly drawn blood is slightly alkaline. (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n  The size of the corpuscles has been ascertained by Graber, who found\r\n  that the diameter of the circular blood-disks of the leaf-beetle,\r\n  _Lina populi_, is 0.006 mm.; of _Cetonia aurata_ and _Zabrus\r\n  gibbus_, 0.008 to 0.01 mm.; and those of certain Orthoptera\r\n  _(Decticus verrucivorus_, _Ephippiger vitium_ and _Œdipoda\r\n  cœrulescens_), 0.011 to 0.014 mm. The longest diameter of the\r\n  elongated corpuscles of _Carabus cancellatus_ is 0.008 mm.; of\r\n  _Gryllus campestris_, _Locusta viridissima_, _Cossus ligniperda_,\r\n  _Sphinx ligustri_ (pupa), and others, 0.008 to 0.01 mm.; of\r\n  _Caloptenus italicus_, _Saturnia pyri_, _Anax formosus_, and others,\r\n  0.011 to 0.014 mm.; of _Ephippiger vitium_, _Œdipoda cœrulescens_,\r\n  _Pezotettix mendax_, _Zabrus gibbus_, _Phryganea_, and others, 0.012\r\n  to 0.022 mm.; in _Stenobothrus donatus_ and _variabilis_, 0.012 to\r\n  0.035 mm. The largest known are those of _Melolontha vulgaris_,\r\n  which measure from 0.027 to 0.03 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 381.—Blood corpuscles, or leucocytes, of insects: _A_, _a-g_, of\r\n    _Stenobothrus dorsatus_ (the same forms occur in most Orthoptera and\r\n    in other insects). _B_, _a_, leucocyte of the same insect with the\r\n    nucleus brought out by ether; _b_, another of serpentine shape. _C_,\r\n    leucocytes of the same insect after a longer stay in ether. _D_,\r\n    leucocytes of the same after being in glycerine 14 days.—After\r\n    Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature of the corpuscles, Graber concludes that they are\r\nmore like the cells of the fat-bodies than genuine cells. That they are\r\nnot true cells is shown by the fact that after remaining in their normal\r\ncondition a long time they finally coalesce and form cords. After\r\nshrivelling, or after the blood has been subjected to different kinds of\r\ntreatment, the nucleus is clearly brought out (Fig. 381).\r\n\r\nBesides the blood corpuscles there have been detected in the blood round\r\nbodies which are regarded as fat-cells. They are circular, and for the\r\nmost part larger than the blood corpuscles, have a sharp, even, dark\r\noutline, and an invariably circular nucleus. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  The blood of Meloe, besides the amœboid corpuscles, according to\r\n  Cuénot, contains abundant fibrinogen, which forms a clot; a pigment\r\n  (uranidine), which is oxidized and precipitated when exposed to the\r\n  air; a dissolved albuminoid (hæmoxanthine), which has both a\r\n  respiratory and nutritive function; and, finally, dissolved\r\n  cantharidine.\r\n\r\n  The corpuscles arise from tissues which are very similar to the\r\n  fat-bodies, and which, at given times, separate into cells. The\r\n  position of these tissues is not always the same in different\r\n  insects. In caterpillars, they occur in the thorax, near the germs\r\n  of the wings; in the saw-flies (Lyda), in all parts of the thorax\r\n  and abdomen; in larval flies (Musca), in the end of the abdomen,\r\n  just in front of the large terminal stigmata. The place where the\r\n  blood corpuscles are formed is usually near, or in relation with,\r\n  the fat-bodies. But while the fat-bodies mostly serve as the\r\n  material for the formation of the blood-building tissues, in\r\n  caterpillars the tracheal matrix also, and, in dipterous larvæ, the\r\n  hypodermis serve this purpose. (Cæsar Schaeffer in Kolbe. See also\r\n  Wielowiejski, Ueber das Blutgewebe.)\r\n\r\n  Other substances occur in the blood of insects. Landois (1864)\r\n  demonstrated the existence of egg albumen, globulin, fibrin, and\r\n  iron in the blood of caterpillars. Poulton found that the blood of\r\n  caterpillars often contained chlorophyll and xanthophyll derived\r\n  from their food plants. A. G. Mayer has recently found that the\r\n  blood (hæmolymph) of the pupæ of Saturniidæ (_Callosamia promethea_)\r\n  contains egg albumin, globulin, fibrin, xanthophyll, and\r\n  orthophosphoric acid, and Oenslager has determined that iron,\r\n  potassium, and sodium are also present. (Mayer.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _c._ The circulation of the blood\r\n\r\nEvery part of the body and its appendages is bathed by the blood, which\r\ncirculates in the wings of insects freshly emerged from the nymph or\r\npupal state, and even courses through the scales of Lepidoptera, as\r\ndiscovered by Jaeger (Isis, 1837).\r\n\r\nIn describing the mechanism of the heart we have already considered in a\r\ngeneral way the mode of circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe heart pumping the blood into the aorta, the nutritive fluid passes\r\nout and returns along each side of the body; distinct, smaller streams\r\npassing into the antennæ, the legs, wings (of certain insects), and into\r\nthe abdominal appendages when they are present. All this may readily be\r\nobserved in transparent aquatic insects, such as larval Ephemeræ,\r\ndragon-flies, etc., kept alive for the purpose under the microscope in\r\nthe animalcule box.\r\n\r\nCarus, in 1827, first discovered the fact of a complete circulation of\r\nthe blood, in the larva of Ephemera. He saw the blood issuing in several\r\nstreams from the end of the aorta in the head and returning in currents\r\nwhich entered the base of the antennæ and limbs in which it formed\r\nloops, and then flowing into the abdomen, entered the posterior end of\r\nthe heart. Wagner (Isis, 1832) confirmed these observations, adding one\r\nof his own, that the blood flows backward in two venous currents, one at\r\nthe sides of the body and intestine, and the other alongside of the\r\nheart itself, and that the blood not only entered at the end of the\r\nheart, but also at the sides of each segment, at the position of the\r\nvalves discovered by Straus-Dürckheim.\r\n\r\nNewport maintains that the course of the blood is in any part of the\r\nbody, as well as in the wings, almost invariably in immediate connection\r\nwith the course of the tracheæ, for the reason that “the currents of\r\nblood in the body of an insect are often in the vicinity of the great\r\ntracheal vessels, both in their longitudinal and transverse direction\r\nacross the segments.”\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the blood in the wings directly after the exuviation\r\nof the nymph or pupa skin, and before they become dry, has been proved\r\nby several observers. As stated by Newport, the so-called “veins” or\r\n“nervures” of the wings consist of tracheæ lying in a hollow cavity, the\r\nperitracheal space being situated chiefly under and on each side of the\r\ntrachea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 382.—Circulation of the blood in hind wing of _Periplaneta\r\n    orientalis_: the arrows indicate the usual direction of the blood\r\n    currents.—After Moseley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Newport gives the following summary of the observations of the early\r\n  observers, to which we add the observations of Moseley. “A motion of\r\n  the fluids has been seen by Carus in wings of recently developed\r\n  Libellulidæ, _Ephemera lutea_ and _E. marginata_, and _Chrysopa\r\n  perla_; among the Coleoptera, in the elytra and wings of _Lampyris\r\n  italica_ and _L. splendidula_, _Melolontha solstitialis_ and\r\n  Dytiscus.” Ehrenberg saw it in Mantis, and Wagner in the young of\r\n  _Nepa cinerea_ and _Cimex lectularius_. Carus detected a circulation\r\n  in the pupal wings of some Lepidoptera, and Bowerbank witnessed it\r\n  in a Noctuid (_Phlogophora meticulosa_); Burmeister observed it in\r\n  _Eristalis tenax_ and _E. nemorum_, and Mr. Tyrrel in _Musca\r\n  domestica_, but it has not been observed in the wings of\r\n  Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  Bowerbank observed that in the lower wing of _Chrysopa perla_ the\r\n  blood passes from the base of the wing along the costal,\r\n  post-costal, and externo-medial veins, outwards to the apex of the\r\n  wing, giving off smaller currents in its course, and that it returns\r\n  along the anal vein to the thorax. He found that the larger veins,\r\n  1⁄408 in. in diameter, contained tracheæ which only measured 1⁄2222\r\n  of an inch in diameter; but in others the tracheæ measured 1⁄1340,\r\n  while the cavity measured only 1⁄500 of an inch. He states, also,\r\n  that the tracheæ very rarely give off branches while passing along\r\n  the main veins, and that they lie along the canals in a tortuous\r\n  course. (Newport, art. Insecta, p. 980.)\r\n\r\n  Bowerbank, also, in his observations on the circulation in the wings\r\n  of Chrysopa, “used every endeavor to discover, if possible, whether\r\n  the blood has proper vessels, or only occupied the internal cavities\r\n  of the canals; and that he is convinced that the latter is the case,\r\n  as he could frequently perceive the particles not only surrounding\r\n  all parts of the tracheæ, and occupying the whole of the internal\r\n  diameter of the canals, but that it frequently happens that globules\r\n  experienced a momentary stoppage in their progress, occasioned by\r\n  their friction against the curved surface of the tracheæ, which\r\n  sometimes gave them a rotatory motion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 383.—Parts of a vein of the cockroach, showing the nerve (_n_)\r\n    by the side of the trachea (_tr_); _c_, blood corpuscles.—After\r\n    Moseley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Moseley found, owing to the large size and number of the corpuscles,\r\n  that the circulation of the blood in the wings of insects is most\r\n  easily observed in the cockroach, especially the hind wings. As seen\r\n  in Moseley’s figure, the blood flows outward from the body through\r\n  the larger veins (I and II) of the front edge of the wings, which he\r\n  calls the main arteries of the wings, and more generally returns to\r\n  the body through the veins in the middle of the wing; the blood also\r\n  flows out from the body through the inner longitudinal veins (those\r\n  behind vein IV), and the blood is also seen to flow through some of\r\n  the small cross-veins. Fig. 383 shows one of the main trunks during\r\n  active circulation. The corpuscles change their form readily, “the\r\n  spindle-shaped ones doubling up in order to pass crossways through a\r\n  narrow aperture.... In the irregularly formed corpuscles, which seem\r\n  to represent leucocytes amœboid movements were observed....\r\n  Corpuscles pass freely above and under the tracheæ, showing that\r\n  these latter lie free in the vessels.” The hypodermis lining the\r\n  vessels is best seen in the small transverse veins.\r\n\r\nThe pulse or heart-beat of insects varies in rapidity in different\r\ninsects, rising at times of excitement, as Newport noticed in\r\n_Anthophora retusa_, to 142 beats in a minute.\r\n\r\nWhen an insect, as, for example, a tineid caterpillar, has been enclosed\r\nin a tight box for a day or more, the pulsations of the heart are very\r\nlanguid and slow, but soon, on giving it air, the pulsations will, as we\r\nhave observed, rise in frequency to about 60 a minute, Herold observed\r\n30 to 40 in a minute in a fully-grown silkworm, and from 46 to 48 in a\r\nmuch younger one. Suckow observed but 30 a minute in a full-grown\r\ncaterpillar of _Gastropacha pini_, and 18 only in its pupa.\r\n\r\n  In a series of observations made by Newport on _Sphinx ligustri_\r\n  from the fourth day after hatching from the egg until the perfect\r\n  insect was developed, he found that before the larva cast its first\r\n  skin the mean number of pulsations, in a state of moderate activity\r\n  and quietude, was about 82 or 83 a minute; before the second moult\r\n  89, while before the third casting it had sunk down to 63; and\r\n  before its fourth to 45, while, before leaving its fourth stage, and\r\n  before it had ceased to feed, preparatory to pupating, the pulse was\r\n  not more than 39. “Thus the number gradually decreases during the\r\n  growing larva state, but the force of the circulation is very much\r\n  augmented. Now when the insect is in a state of perfect rest,\r\n  previously to changing its skin, the number is pretty nearly equal\r\n  at each period, being about 30. When the insect has passed into the\r\n  pupa state it sinks down to 22, and subsequently to 10 or 12, and\r\n  after that, during the period of hibernation, it almost entirely\r\n  ceases. But when the same insect which we had watched from its\r\n  earliest condition was developed into the perfect state in May of\r\n  the following spring, the number of pulsations, after the insect had\r\n  been for some time excited in flight around the room, amounted to\r\n  from 110 to 139; and when the same insect was in a state of repose,\r\n  to from 41 to 50. When, however, the great business of life, the\r\n  continuation of the species, has been accomplished, or when the\r\n  insect is exhausted, and perishing through want of food or other\r\n  causes, the number of pulsations gradually diminishes, until the\r\n  motions of the heart are almost imperceptible.” Insects, then, he\r\n  remarks, do not deviate from other animals in regard to their vital\r\n  phenomena, though it has been wrongly imagined that the nutrient and\r\n  circulatory functions are less active in the perfect than in the\r\n  larval condition.\r\n\r\n  The heart of a larval _Gastrus equi_ taken the day previous from a\r\n  horse’s stomach beat from 40 to 44 times a minute (Scheiber); while\r\n  Schröder van der Kolk observed only 30 beats in the same kind of\r\n  maggot.\r\n\r\n  In the larva of Corethra, while at rest, the heart contracts from 12\r\n  to 16 or 18 times a minute, but when active the number rises to 22.\r\n  The systole and diastole last from 5 to 6 minutes. (Dogiel.)\r\n\r\n  Temperature also affects the pulsations, as they increase in\r\n  frequency with a rise and decrease with a fall in temperature.\r\n\r\n  =Influence of electricity.=—The influence of electricity on the\r\n  action of the insect’s heart, from Dogiel’s experiments, is such as\r\n  to cause an acceleration in the frequency of the beats, while an\r\n  increase in the strength of the electric currents either diminishes\r\n  the frequency of the beats or entirely stops the heart’s action. A\r\n  violent excitation with the induction current causes a systole when\r\n  the heart’s action has stopped for a long time; and if the\r\n  excitation lasts uninterruptedly, then the contractions after a\r\n  while become noticeable, according to the strength of the current.\r\n  In such a case there are, however, interruptions in the regularity,\r\n  strength, and order of the contractions. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n  =Effects of poisons on the pulsations.=—Dogiel has also experimented\r\n  on the influence of poisons in the form of vapor or as liquid\r\n  solutions on the pulsations of insects, which is much as in\r\n  vertebrates. The application of carbonic oxide to the larva of\r\n  Corethra, whose heart one minute previous to the poisoning beat 15\r\n  times a minute, accelerated the heart-beats in about 55 minutes to\r\n  25 pulsations in a minute. Afterwards there was a retardation in the\r\n  pulse to the normal beat. Carbonic acid had a similar effect.\r\n\r\nThe following results obtained by Dogiel are somewhat as tabulated by\r\nKolbe:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Substances which cause the pulsations of the heart to accelerate.\r\n\r\n       _a._  An induction current of electricity, acting feebly.\r\n       _b._  Ammonia, acting feebly.\r\n       _c._  Ethyl ether, acting feebly.\r\n       _d._  Oxalic acid, acting feebly.\r\n       _e._  Carbolic acid, acting feebly.\r\n       _f._  Potassium nitrate, acting feebly.\r\n       _g._  Aconite, acting feebly.\r\n\r\n\r\n              II. Substances retarding the heart’s action.\r\n\r\n    _a._  An induction current of electricity, acting energetically.\r\n    _b._  Ammonia, acting energetically.\r\n    _c._  Ethyl ether, acting energetically.\r\n    _d._  Oxalic acid, acting energetically.\r\n    _e._  Carbolic acid, acting energetically.\r\n    _f._  Veratrine, acting energetically.\r\n    _g._  Atropine, acting energetically.\r\n    _h._  Aconitine, acting energetically.\r\n    _i._  Potassium nitrate, acting energetically.\r\n    _g._  Ethyl alcohol.\r\n    _h._  Chloroform.\r\n    _i._  Carbonic oxide.\r\n    _j._  Carbonic acid.\r\n    _k._  Sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n              III. Substances whose action is indifferent.\r\n\r\n                     _1._  Muscarine.\r\n                     _2._  Curare.\r\n                     _3._  Atropine, acting slowly.\r\n                     _4._  Strychnine.\r\n\r\n  The above-named substances comprise those which in the vertebrates\r\n  effect a change in the activity of the motor nerve-ganglia of the\r\n  heart and the muscular fibres. Hence it follows that the heart of\r\n  the larval Corethra consists of muscular fibres provided with\r\n  ganglia, and that the contractions of the muscular fibres are\r\n  provoked through the agency of the ganglia. But since muscarine,\r\n  atropine, and curare, whose influence in stopping the heart’s action\r\n  of vertebrates is known, in insects either have no action or only\r\n  make the pulsations slower; it seems to follow that the heart of the\r\n  larval Corethra possesses no similar apparatus for lessening the\r\n  heart’s action, and this is also confirmed by anatomical studies. On\r\n  the contrary, aconite acts, as we must from observations conclude,\r\n  exclusively on the motor centres and the muscles, but not on the\r\n  apparatus for lessening the heart’s action, which, as has been\r\n  remarked, is not present in the larval Corethra. (Kolbe _ex_\r\n  Dogiel.)\r\n\r\n  Dewitz has discovered an onward movement of the blood corpuscles,\r\n  somewhat independent of the general circulation. This independent\r\n  motion of the blood corpuscles is not only a creeping one like the\r\n  amœboid motion of the white corpuscles of vertebrates, but they have\r\n  besides a peculiar swimming movement. Dewitz noticed this in the\r\n  hind wings of a recently emerged meal-worm beetle (_Tenebrio\r\n  molitor_), still white and soft, after they had been cut off. The\r\n  tissues forming the matrix within the wings constitute a network\r\n  filled with blood. The current of blood within the wing thus cut off\r\n  may be stopped flowing by a tap on the firmly clamped object-bearer\r\n  on which the wing is placed, or by drawing it by an apparatus\r\n  described by the same author, to incite in one way or another the\r\n  blood corpuscles to swim forwards. When a corpuscle is disposed to\r\n  move, we see it first stirring restlessly, or wabbling about, in\r\n  this way changing its form; then it moves forwards, and does not\r\n  come to a standstill. If it remains still there, after a while, by\r\n  tapping, it begins again its movements.\r\n\r\n  “Should one yet doubt the fact of this spontaneous movement of the\r\n  blood corpuscles, he will surely be convinced of its correctness by\r\n  observing the so-to-speak reluctantly springing motion of a blood\r\n  corpuscle in the wing of _Tenebrio molitor_ with the simultaneous\r\n  change of appearance and shape of the corpuscle.”\r\n\r\n  This spontaneous or independent motion of the blood corpuscles is\r\n  also produced by the heating apparatus. As soon as the corpuscles\r\n  lie still in the severed wing and they are warmed, the corpuscles\r\n  begin to pass through the meshes of the tissue. When cooled, the\r\n  motion ceases, but as soon as the temperature rises to a certain\r\n  grade, the corpuscles again move onwards.\r\n\r\n  To explain this independent motion Dewitz thinks that they take up\r\n  and then expel the blood-fluid, and in this way cause their motion.\r\n  This independent motion is necessitated, in order that the stream of\r\n  blood may become so regulated, that the blood corpuscles shall not\r\n  be arrested in their course, but even turn back again out of the\r\n  farther end of the antennæ and limbs. The chief mechanical power for\r\n  the blood circulation must go on independently of the propulsatorial\r\n  apparatus and of the heart.

The blood corpuscles. (See p. 407, leucocytes and phagocytes.)\r\n 2. The fat-body proper (_Corpus adiposum_).\r\n 3. The pericardial fat-body (pericardial cells).\r\n 4. The œnocytes.\r\n 5. The garland-shaped cord of muscid larvæ.\r\n 6. The subœsophageal body, a peculiar organ found by Wheeler in the\r\n    embryos and young larvæ of Blatta and Xiphidium.\r\n 7. The phosphorescent organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _a._ The fat-body\r\n\r\nIn the body cavity of winged insects and of their larvæ occur yellowish\r\nmasses of large cells filled with small drops of fat, and forming the\r\n“fat-body.” It is of various shapes, more or less lobulated or net-like,\r\nand covers or envelops parts of the viscera, also forming a layer under\r\nthe integument (Fig. 143). The tracheal endings are usually enveloped by\r\nthe fat-body. It is larger in the larvæ than in the adults, especially\r\nin Lepidoptera, in them forming a reserve of nutrition, used during\r\nmetamorphosis and during the formation and ripening of the eggs and male\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n  Wielowiejski has shown that there is a regular arrangement of the\r\n  fat-body in the general cavity of the body. For example, in the\r\n  larva of Chironomus occur the following forms of this tissue. Around\r\n  the periphery, on each side of the body cavity, is a loose network\r\n  of lobes with large meshes constituting the peripheral layer or\r\n  external lobular fat-body; these lobular masses are segmentally\r\n  arranged.\r\n\r\n  Within these segmental lobes, on each side of and along the\r\n  digestive tract, extending along through almost the entire body, is\r\n  an unbroken strand of this tissue, forming the internal fat-body\r\n  cords. From the first larval stage, and even before hatching, its\r\n  cells are so unusually large, being filled with large, clear, mostly\r\n  colorless fat-drops, that their limits cannot be defined, and their\r\n  nuclei can only with great difficulty be detected. Only in some\r\n  large larvæ of Chironomus has Wielowiejski found clearly defined\r\n  cells; the protoplasm of these cells contain almost no fat-drops.\r\n\r\n  The fat-body is of mesodermal origin, and as Wheeler insists, is not\r\n  derived from the œnocytes, as supposed by Graber. Formed from the\r\n  mesoderm, it is a differentiation of portions of the cœlomic walls,\r\n  and therefore metameric in origin. That the fat-body gives origin to\r\n  the blood corpuscles Wheeler is doubtful.\r\n\r\n  The fat-cells are distinct, spherical, and as a rule possess only\r\n  one nucleus, though in those of Apis and Melophagus there are two\r\n  nuclei, and in Musca several. Sometimes the cells contain a\r\n  substance like the white of an egg, and concretions of uric acid, or\r\n  these take the place of the fat-drops. The presence of uric acid\r\n  shows that a very active metabolism goes on in the fat-body. “In\r\n  some cases it has been proved that the fat-body in the larva is rich\r\n  in fat and poor in concretions of uric acid, while in the imago it\r\n  is poor in fat and rich in concretions of uric acid” (Lang).\r\n\r\n  Leydig, in 1857 (Lehrbuch der Histiologie), spoke of the presence of\r\n  dark concretions in the fat-body, and afterwards (1864) showed that\r\n  there was a wide distribution of uric acid salts and concretions.\r\n  Witlaczil, also, has detected concretions in the fat-body of the\r\n  Psyllidæ, in larval Cecidomyiidæ, in the larvæ and pupæ of ants, and\r\n  in the pupa of Musca.\r\n\r\n  The physiological processes which take place in the fat-bodies are\r\n  obscure. Graber regarded the whole system of the fat-bodies as “a\r\n  single, many-lobed lung,” while before him Landois, taking into\r\n  account the intimate relation existing between the finer tracheal\r\n  branches and the fat-body, considered that the latter was concerned\r\n  in respiration. Marchal thinks that the fat-body is a urinary organ,\r\n  as the urates are formed within the cells of this body.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, Schäffer maintains that a special kind of fat-body cell\r\n  has the important function of taking up and giving out nutritious\r\n  matters during the internal processes of metamorphosis, while he\r\n  also believes that there is a genetic connection between the\r\n  fat-body and the blood corpuscles—a view combated by Wheeler.\r\n\r\n  Kowalevsky finds that the fat-body remains absolutely insensible to\r\n  the action of the substances which stained the Malpighian tubes (p.\r\n  352). So long as the cells are healthy and living they are not\r\n  stained and do not absorb the colors in question; and this\r\n  insensibility persists, even when the cells are of a different\r\n  nature, as those of the fly (adipose and “intercalary” cells).\r\n\r\n\r\n           _b._ The pericardial fat-body or pericardial cells\r\n\r\nWe have already, on p. 405, called attention to these organs, but they\r\nalso have an intimate relation to the fat-body.\r\n\r\nKowalevsky (1892) remarks that the disposition of these cells varies\r\nmuch in different insects and even in the same animal. Thus, in the\r\nDiptera and the ordinary flies there are found around the lower part of\r\nthe dorsal vessel 13 pairs of large pericardial cells which lie next to\r\na crowded bed of small cells forming a compact mass around the anterior\r\npart of the dorsal vessel. In caterpillars, notably silkworms, from the\r\ncompact layer of pericardial cells which surround the heart, pass off\r\ntrunks which are directed towards the lateral walls of the body, also\r\nforming close networks around the tracheæ and then passing down into the\r\nabdominal cavity of the body of the larva.\r\n\r\nIn the larvæ of certain Hymenoptera, the trunks which pass off from the\r\npericardial region form a loose cord, a sort of fatty tissue covering\r\nthe entire body cavity.\r\n\r\n  This tissue, adds Kowalevsky, entirely differs from œnocytes, or\r\n  from the so-called glandular body whose formation in Gryllotalpa has\r\n  been described by Korotaiev, and in _Bombyx mori_ by Tichomiroff. In\r\n  a recent work wherein has been collected everything known regarding\r\n  these last-named cells, Pékarsky proves that they are unique in\r\n  nature and cannot be regarded either as fat-cells, or as pericardial\r\n  cells, or even as formative leucocytes.\r\n\r\nAs to the structure of the pericardial cells, Kowalevsky adds that they\r\nare always attached to muscular fibres passing off from the heart, and\r\nthat they lie, so to speak, upon them. In the locusts the muscular\r\nfibres supporting the pericardial cells appear distinctly like little\r\nstaves or sticks. The attachment of the pericardial cells to the\r\nmuscular fibres has been observed by Cuénot and reproduced by him in his\r\nwork, but his description somewhat differs from that observed by\r\nKowalevsky in the locust (_Acrydium migratorium_).\r\n\r\n  As to the nature of the acid excretions which are formed in the\r\n  pericardial cells, in spite of his attempts to solve the problem,\r\n  Kowalevsky has been unsuccessful. The only observations in this\r\n  direction are those of Letellier on the pericardial glands of\r\n  lamellibranch molluscs, which he found to contain hypouric acid, and\r\n  it is probable, says Kowalevsky, that the acidity of the pericardial\r\n  cells in insects is due to the presence of the same acid.\r\n\r\n=Leucocytes or phagocytes in connection with the pericardial cells.=—It\r\nis thought by Schäffer that the leucocytes or phagocytes may be free or\r\nwandering fat-body cells. They play an important part in metamorphosis,\r\nwhile they absorb or feed upon the remains of the larval organs, and\r\nthus prove of use in the building up of the organs of the adult insects.\r\n\r\nWhile the faculty of _phagocytosis_ is wanting in the urinary tubes,\r\nBalbiani and more recently Cuénot have expressed the opinion that the\r\npericardial cells of insects may have the power of absorbing hard\r\nbodies, “acting as a phagocytic gland.” This, however, is called in\r\nquestion by Kowalevsky, from studies made on different insects. On\r\nintroducing powdered carmine into the body of an insect it has not been\r\nabsorbed by the pericardial cells, as they have not been colored red. It\r\nis the leucocytes which absorb the grains of carmine, and which, after\r\nhaving dissolved them, transmit them to the pericardial cells. Hence,\r\nthen, the pericardial cells have not the phagocytic power of which\r\nCuénot speaks.\r\n\r\nReturning to his own observations on hard bodies introduced into\r\ninsects, or large globules introduced under the form of a milk emulsion,\r\nKowalevsky has found that these bodies were absorbed in the first place\r\nby the free-swimming leucocytes, and in the second place by whole groups\r\nor nests of leucocytes situated in different parts of the body,\r\nprincipally on the threads of the adipose body. In the Orthoptera the\r\nabsorption is immediately effected by means of the cells of the membrane\r\nwhich separates the pericardium from the cavity of the body underneath\r\nthe heart. The regions where the hard bodies are absorbed in great\r\nnumber coincide with the regions of formation of the blood corpuscles.\r\nIn his researches on the larvæ of Hyponomeuta and other Lepidoptera,\r\nSchäffer describes these regions as forming a sort of island. The nests\r\nwhere the blood globules are formed are the most active centres of\r\nphagocytosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 384.-Section of the heart (_c_) and pericardial cells (_pc_,\r\n    _pc_) from the posterior part of the heart of a fly: _l_, _l_, nests\r\n    of leucocytes situated between the heart and pericardial cells.—From\r\n    a microphotograph, after Kowalevsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 385.—Cross-section of the heart of _Truxalis nasata_ and of the\r\n    structures around it: _c_, heart: _ep_, epithelium under the\r\n    cuticula (hvpodermis); _or_, ovarian tubes; _pc_, pericardial cells,\r\n    with one or two nuclei containing a deposit of carmine; _l_ and\r\n    _l′_, group of leucocytes, which have absorbed granules of India\r\n    ink.—After Kowalevsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Balbiani, and also Cuénot, have supposed that the formation of the\r\n  blood corpuscles takes place in the pericardial cells, but\r\n  Kowalevsky insists that these cells cannot form the leucocytes,\r\n  which “are probably formed in different parts of the body, notably\r\n  in the special nests [_Herde_ of Jäger] situated near the heart, but\r\n  outside of the pericardial cells.”\r\n\r\n  In Fig. 384, where the nests of leucocytes (_l_) are shown, it is\r\n  evident that they are formed where observed, and “could not have\r\n  come from the pericardial cells, which have their own structure and\r\n  their special function,” these cells being very large and\r\n  characteristic.\r\n\r\n  In Kowalevsky’s preparations of Truxalis, the pericardial cells with\r\n  deposits of carmine and the groups of leucocytes (Fig. 385, _l_ and\r\n  _l′_) stained with India ink, we have to deal with elements\r\n  absolutely different. If the formation of leucocytes was caused by\r\n  the pericardial cells, these last would be obliged to free\r\n  themselves from their contents and to modify their essential nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _c._ The œnocytes\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 386.—Cluster of œnocytes from a nearly mature Phryganeid larva:\r\n    _o_, œnocytes; _t_, large tracheal branch; _tt_, smaller tracheal\r\n    ramifications; _h_, tracheal hypodermis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 387.—A nearly mature embryo of Xiphidium ensiferum: _o_, _o_,\r\n    œnocyte clusters seen from the surface through the integument; _a_,\r\n    pleuropodium of the right side (appendage of the first abdominal\r\n    segment); _s_, styli; _c_, cercopods.—This and Fig. 386 after\r\n    Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese cells (Fig. 386), with the exception of the eggs, are the largest\r\nin the body, and occur in most if not all winged insects. They were\r\ncalled _œnocytes_ (_oinos_, wine; _kustis_, cyst), by Wielowiejski in\r\nallusion to their wine-yellow color. These cells are arranged\r\nsegmentally (Fig. 387) in clusters, held in place by tracheæ, and are\r\nsituated mostly on each side of the abdomen, rarely being found in the\r\nadjoining parts of the thorax. They are more or less intimately\r\nassociated with the blood and fat-body. Unlike the fat-body, however,\r\nthey arise in embryonic life from the ectoderm, either by delamination\r\nor by immigration, just behind the tracheal involutions.\r\n\r\n  The separate cells of each cluster are usually separate, but in rare\r\n  cases may fuse in pairs or form smaller clusters. In shape they are\r\n  round or oval, often sending out pseudopodia-like processes, by\r\n  which they are attached to the tracheal twigs or to each other. “The\r\n  cytoplasm, which is very abundant, is full of yellowish granules and\r\n  is sometimes radially situated towards its periphery. The large\r\n  spherical or oval nucleus contains a densely wound and delicate\r\n  chromatic filament.” (Wheeler.)\r\n\r\n  Graber first pointed out the identity of these clusters of cells\r\n  with certain metameric cell-masses in insect embryos, observed by\r\n  Tichomiroff in those of the silkworm, and by Korotneff in the embryo\r\n  mole-cricket.\r\n\r\n  Although they resemble the blood corpuscles in some insects, they\r\n  are always much larger, and do not seem to be amœboid, while they\r\n  are never seen to undergo self-division, or to exhibit any\r\n  appearance of giving rise to the blood-cells (Wheeler).

The luminous or photogenic organ\r\nis regarded by Wielowiejski and also by Emery as morphologically a\r\nspecialized portion of the fat-body, being a plate consisting of\r\npolygonal cells, situated directly under the integument, and supplied\r\nwith nerves and fine tracheal branches.\r\n\r\nIn Luciola as well as in other fireflies, including Pyrophorus, the\r\nphosphorescent organ or plate consists, as first stated by Kölliker, of\r\ntwo layers lying one over the other, a dorsal one (Fig. 388, _d_) which\r\nis opaque, chalky white, and non-photogenic, and a lower one (_v_), the\r\nactive photogenic layer, which is transparent. Through the upper or\r\nopaque layer and on its dorsal surface extend large tracheæ and their\r\nhorizontal branches, from which arise numerous very fine branches which\r\npass down perpendicularly into the transparent or photogenic layer of\r\nthe organ. Each tracheal stem, together with its short branches, is\r\nenveloped by a cylindrical mass of transparent tissue, so that only the\r\nshort terminal branches or very fine tracheal capillaries project on the\r\nupper part of the cylinder. These finest tracheal capillaries are not in\r\nLuciola filled with air, but with a colorless fluid, as was also found\r\nby Wielowiejski and others in Lampyris.\r\n\r\nThese transparent cylinders, with the tracheæ within, forming\r\nlongitudinal axes, resemble lobules. These lobules are so distributed\r\nthat they appear on a surface section of this plate as numerous round\r\nareas in which circular periphery the tracheal capillaries are arranged\r\nwith the axially disposed tracheal end-cells. These “tracheal end-cells”\r\nare only membranous enlargements at the base of the tracheal capillaries\r\n(Wielowiejski). The cylindrical lobules are separated from each other by\r\na substance consisting of abundant large granular cells (parenchym\r\ncells) among which project the tracheal capillaries. The cylindrical\r\nlobules extend to the hypodermis and come in contact only by their\r\nlateral faces with the parenchym.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the upper opaque chalky white layer of the\r\nphosphorescent organ is, compared with that of the photogenic lower\r\nportion, very simple. In its loose, pappose, mass are no cellular\r\nelements, but when treated with different reagents it is seen to be\r\nfilled with countless urate granules (guanine) swimming in the fluid it\r\ncontains, the cell plasma appearing to be dissolved, the cells having\r\nlost their cohesion.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the phosphorescent plate or organ of Luciola with that of\r\nLampyris, the general structure, including the clear cell elements of\r\nthe cylindrical lobules, which envelop the perpendicular tracheal twigs\r\nand their branches, and also the granular parenchymatous cells are alike\r\nin both, though the arrangement and distribution of the elements in\r\nLuciola is more regular, in Lampyris the tracheal stems being\r\nirregularly scattered through the parenchym.\r\n\r\nWielowiejski found in the larval and female Lampyris a higher degree of\r\ndifferentiation than in the male, and Luciola has a more differentiated\r\nphotogenic organ than Lampyris, as seen in the more regular structure of\r\nthe lobules.\r\n\r\nAs regards the light-apparatus of Pyrophorus, or the cucujo, Heinemann\r\nshows that, as in the Lampyridæ, it consists of distinct cells, and may\r\nbe regarded as a glandular structure. It is rich in tracheæ and the\r\nother parts already described. In still later researches on a Brazilian\r\nPyrophorus Wielowiejski shows that the phosphorescent plate consists of\r\ntwo layers, the upper usually being filled with crystalline urate\r\nconcretions, and entirely like those of the Lampyridæ, consisting of\r\ndistinct polygonal cells, among which are numerous tracheal stems, with\r\ntænidia, coursing in different directions, when freshly filled with air,\r\nand sending capillaries into the underlying photogenic layer. The latter\r\nshows in its structure a striking difference in the cellular arrangement\r\nfrom that of Lampyrids. In the upper or non-photogenic layer are\r\ntracheal capillaries which pass down into the underlying cellular plate\r\nand which are in the closest possible relations with the single cells—a\r\npoint overlooked by Heinemann.\r\n\r\n=Physiology of the phosphorescence.=—As is well known, the\r\nphosphorescence of animals is a scintillating or glowing light emitted\r\nby various forms, the greenish light or luminous appearance thus\r\nproduced being photogenic, _i.e._ without sensible heat.\r\n\r\nLangley rates the light of the firefly at an efficiency of 100 per cent,\r\nall its radiations lying within the limits of the visible spectrum.\r\n“Langley has shown that while only 2.4 per cent of luminous waves are\r\ncontained in the radiation of a gas-flame, only 10 per cent in that of\r\nthe electric arc, and only 35 per cent in that of the sun, the radiation\r\nof the firefly (_Pyrophorus noctilucus_) consists wholly of visible\r\nwave-frequencies.” (Barker’s Physics, p. 385.)\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the light of the cucujo was found by Pasteur to be\r\ncontinuous. (C. R. French Acad. Sc. 1864, ii, p. 509.) A later\r\nexamination by Aubert and Dubois showed that the spectrum of the light\r\nexamined by the spectroscope is very beautiful, but destitute of dark\r\nbands. When, however, the intensity diminishes, the red and orange\r\ndisappear, and the green and yellow only remain.\r\n\r\nHeinemann studied the cucujo at Vera Cruz, Mexico. At night in a dark\r\nroom it radiates a pale green light which shows a blue tone to the\r\nexclusion of any other light. The more gas or lamp light there is\r\npresent, the more apparent becomes the yellowish green hue, which in\r\nclear daylight changes to an almost pure very light yellow with a very\r\nslight mixture of green. “In the morning and evening twilight, more\r\nconstantly and clearly in the former, the cucujo light, at least to my\r\neyes, is an intensely brilliant yellow with a slight mixture of red. In\r\na dark room lighted with a sodium light the yellow tone entirely\r\ndisappears; on the other hand, the blue strikingly increases.” As\r\nregards the spectrum he found that almost exactly half of the blue end\r\nis wanting and that the red part is also a little narrower than in the\r\nspectrum of the petroleum flame.\r\n\r\nProfessor C. A. Young states that the spectrum given by our common\r\nfirefly (_Photinus?_) is perfectly continuous, without trace of lines\r\neither bright or dark. “It extends from a little above Fraunhofer’s line\r\nC, in the scarlet, to about F in the blue, gradually fading out at the\r\nextremities. It is noticeable that precisely this portion of the\r\nspectrum is composed of rays which, while they more powerfully than any\r\nothers affect the organs of vision, produce hardly any thermal or\r\nactinic effect. In other words, very little of the energy expended in\r\nthe flash of the fire is wasted. It is quite different with our\r\nartificial methods of illumination. In the case of an ordinary gaslight\r\nthe best experiments show that not more than one or two per cent of the\r\nradiant energy consists of _visible rays_; the rest is either invisible\r\nheat or actinism; that is to say, over 98 per cent of the gas is wasted\r\nin producing rays that do not help in making objects visible.”\r\n\r\nPanceri also remarks that while in the spectroscope the light of some\r\nChætopteri, Beroë, and Pyrosoma exhibit one broad band like that given\r\nby monochromatic light, that of Lampyris and Luciola is polychromatic.\r\n(Amer. Nat., vii, 1873, p. 314.)\r\n\r\nThe filtered rays of Lampyris pass (like Röntgen and uranium rays)\r\nthrough aluminium (Muraoka).\r\n\r\nThe physiology of insect phosphorescence is thus briefly stated by Lang:\r\n“The cells of this luminous organ secrete, under the control of the\r\nnervous system, a substance which is burnt during the appearance of the\r\nlight; this combustion takes place by means of the oxygen conveyed to\r\nthe cells of the luminous body by the tracheæ, which branch profusely in\r\nit and break up into capillaries.”\r\n\r\nEmery states that the males of Luciola display their light in two ways.\r\nWhen at night time they are active or flying, the light is given out at\r\nshort and regular intervals, causing the well-known sparkling or\r\nscintillating light. If we catch a flying Luciola or pull apart one\r\nresting in the day time, or cut off its hind body, it gives out a\r\ntolerably strong light, though not nearly reaching the intensity of the\r\nlight waves of the sparkling light. In this case the light is constant,\r\nyet we notice, especially in the wounded insect, that the phosphorescent\r\nplate in its whole extent is not luminous, but glows at different places\r\nas if phosphorescent clouds passed over it.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that a microscopic observation of the light of the\r\nglow-worm or firefly is not possible, but an animal while giving out its\r\nlight, or a separated abdomen, may readily be placed under the\r\nmicroscope and observed under tolerably high powers. By making the\r\nexperiment in a rather dark room Emery saw clear shining rings on a dark\r\nbackground. “All the rings are not equally lighted. Comparing this with\r\nthe results of anatomical investigation, it is seen that the rings of\r\nlight correspond with the previously described circular tracheal\r\ncapillaries, _i.e._ the limits between the tracheal-cell cylinder and\r\nthe parenchym-cells. The parenchym-cells are never stained of a deep\r\nbrown; this proves that its plasma may be the seat of the\r\nlight-producing oxidation. Hence this process of oxidation takes place\r\nin the upper surface of the parenchym-cells, but outside of their own\r\nsubstance. The parenchym-cells in reality secrete the luminous matter;\r\nthis is taken up by the tracheal end-cells and burnt or oxidized by\r\nmeans of the oxygen present in the tracheal capillaries. Such a\r\ncombustion can only take place when the chitinous membrane of the\r\ntracheæ is extraordinarily fine and easily penetrable, as is the case in\r\nthe capillaries of the photogenic plate; therefore the plasma of the\r\ntracheal cells only oxidizes at the forking of the terminal tracheal\r\ntwigs and in the capillaries.” (Emery.)\r\n\r\nThe color of the light of Luciola is identical in the two sexes, and the\r\nintensity is much the same, though that of the female is more\r\nrestricted. The rhythm of the flashes of light given out by the male is\r\nmore rapid, and the flashes briefer, while those of the female are\r\nlonger, more tremulous, and appear at longer intervals.\r\n\r\nEmery then asks: What is the use of this luminosity? Is it only to\r\nallure the females of Luciola, which are so much rarer than the males?\r\nContrary to the general view that it is an alluring act, he thinks that\r\nphosphorescence is a means of defence, or a warning or danger-signal\r\nagainst insectivorous nocturnal animals. If we dissect or crush a\r\nLuciola, it gives out a disagreeable cabbage-like smell, and perhaps\r\nthis is sufficient to render it inedible to bats or other nocturnal\r\nanimals. An acrid taste they certainly do not possess.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the eggs of fireflies, both Lampyridæ and\r\nPyrophorus, are luminous. Both Newport and more recently Wielowiejski\r\nattributes the luminosity not to the contents of the egg, but to the\r\nportions of the fat-body cells or fluid covering on the outside of the\r\neggs, due to ruptures of the parts within the body of the female during\r\noviposition. The larvæ at different ages are also luminous.\r\n\r\nThe position of the luminous organs changes with age. In the larvæ of\r\nPyrophorus before moulting, according to Dubois, the luminous organs are\r\nsituated only on the ventral side of the head and prothoracic segment.\r\nIn larvæ of the second stage there are added three shining spots on each\r\nof the first eight abdominal segments, and a single luminous spot on the\r\nlast segment. These spots are arranged in a linear series and thus form\r\nthree luminous cords. In the adult beetles there is a luminous spot in\r\nthe middle of the first abdominal sternite, but the greatest amount of\r\nlight is produced by the two vesicles on the hinder part of the\r\nprothorax, the position of which varies according to the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LITERATURE ON PHOSPHORESCENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Peters, W.= Ueber das Leuchten der _Lampyris italica_.

The air\r\nenters these tubes through a few openings, called spiracles or\r\n_stigmata_, arranged segmentally in the sides of the body. These tracheæ\r\nare everywhere bathed by the blood, and thus the latter is constantly\r\naërated or kept fresh; the blood not, as in vertebrates or as in\r\nmolluscs, seeking the lungs or gills, or any specialized respiratory\r\nportion of the body where the oxygen combines with the hæmoglobin, but\r\nthe respiratory tubes, so to speak, themselves seek out the blood and\r\nthe blood-tissue in every part of the insect body, penetrating to the\r\ntips of the antennæ and of the legs, entering the most delicate tissues,\r\neven perhaps passing through the walls of epithelial cells. As Lang\r\nremarks, the want of an arterial vascular system is compensated for as\r\nwell as conditioned by the extremely profuse branching of the tracheæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 389.—Rat-tailed larva of Eristalis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe aquatic larvæ of certain dragon-flies (Agrionidæ), may-flies,\r\ncase-worms, etc., respire by means of tracheal gills or branchiæ, which\r\nare either filamental or leaf-like appendages containing tracheæ.\r\nSomewhat similar structures appended to the thorax of pupal aquatic\r\nDiptera, as in the mosquito and its allies, enable them to breathe while\r\nstationed a little beneath the surface of the water. Other larvæ, as the\r\nrat-tail larva of Eristalis, etc., lying at the bottom of shallow pools\r\nor in ditches, etc., can breathe by raising slightly above the surface a\r\nlong appendage with two spiracles at the end, through which the air\r\nenters the tracheal system. (See p. 461.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Aristotle, as well as the natural philosophers of the Middle\r\nAges, supposed that insects did not breathe, one can easily see that\r\nthey do by holding a grasshopper or dragon-fly in one’s hand and\r\nobserving the rhythmical rise and fall of the upper and lower walls of\r\nthe abdomen, during which the air enters and passes out of the\r\nair-openings or spiracles on each side of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that insects consume very little air, since caterpillars may\r\nbe confined in very small, almost air-tight tin boxes, and continue to\r\neat and undergo their transformations without suffering from the\r\nconfinement. According to H. Müller an insect placed in a small,\r\nconfined space absorbs all the oxygen. Insects can survive for many\r\nhours when placed in an exhausted receiver, or in certain irrespirable\r\ngases. “Cockroaches in carbonic acid speedily become insensible, but\r\nafter twelve hours’ exposure to the pure gas they survive and appear\r\nnone the worse.” (Miall and Denny, p. 165.) Insects of the swiftest\r\nflight breathe most rapidly, their great muscular activity requiring the\r\nabsorption of an abundance of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 390.—Section of Sphinx embryo, showing at _s_ the ectoderm\r\n    invaginated, and forming the germ of a stigma and trachea\r\n    (_t_).—After Kowalevsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWarmth, plenty of food, besides muscular activity, increases the demand\r\nfor oxygen and the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _a._ The tracheæ\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 391.—Portion of a trachea of a caterpillar, with its branches\r\n    _B_, _C_, _D_: _a_, peritracheal membrane; _b_, nucleus.—After\r\n    Leydig, from Gegenbaur.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 392.—Structure of a trachea, diagrammatic: portions of the\r\n    peritracheal membrane (_hy_) and chitinous intima (_cc_) removed to\r\n    show the structure; in the chitinous intima or endotrachea (cc) can\r\n    be seen the spiral thickenings or tænidia.—After Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will much simplify our conception of the nature of the air-tubes when\r\nwe learn that they originate in the embryo as tubular ingrowths of the\r\nintegument (ectoderm), these branching and finally reaching every part\r\nof the interior of the body. They are elastic tubes, and being filled\r\nwith air are silvery in color, though at their origin near the spiracles\r\nthey are reddish or violet bluish; or, in the larva of Æschna, reddish\r\nbrown, this tint being due to a finely granular pigment situated in the\r\nperitoneal membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 393.—Longitudinal section of the trachea of _Hydrophilus piceus_:\r\n    _ep_, epithelium; _cu_, cuticula; _f_, spiral threads.—After Minot.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn their essential structure the tracheæ consist of the chitinous\r\nintima, which is a continuation of the cuticle of the integument, and of\r\na cellular membrane or outer layer of cells (a continuation of the\r\nhypodermis) called the peritoneal membrane, or ectotrachea (Figs. 392,\r\n393).\r\n\r\nLeydig discovered that the spiral filaments are not distinct and\r\nseparate, but intimately connected with the inner membrane (intima), and\r\nhe detected the outer or peritoneal membrane, which Chun afterwards\r\nfound to be epithelial in its nature, Minot stating that it is a true\r\npavement epithelium.\r\n\r\nFigure 393 represents a longitudinal section of a large trachea of\r\nHydrophilus, showing the peritoneal membrane (_ectotrachea_, _ep_) and\r\nthe intima or _endotrachea_, divided into the cuticula (_cu_), with the\r\ndarker colored inner layer, in which are embedded the dark-colored\r\ntænidia (_f_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 394.—Testis of Anabrus, showing the ramifications of the\r\n    tracheæ.—After Minot.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Distribution of the tracheæ.=—The distribution of the air-tubes, as\r\nLubbock and also Minot state, depends first upon the shape of the\r\norgans, and upon the size of those whose size is variable. Around the\r\nlarge, hollow organs (digestive canal, sexual organs) the tracheæ ramify\r\nin all directions, forking so that the branches diverge at a wide angle.\r\nIn the organs which have muscular walls, like the oviduct, the tracheæ\r\nrun straight when the walls are distended, but have a sinuous course\r\nwhen the walls are contracted. (Minot.)\r\n\r\n  “Around the organs of more elongated form the branches of the\r\n  tracheæ run more longitudinally, as is shown by the air-tubes of the\r\n  muscles, which also present some peculiarities worthy of especial\r\n  notice.\r\n\r\n  “A short, thick trunk arrives at the muscular bundle, and dividing\r\n  very rapidly, breaks up into a large number of delicate tubes, which\r\n  penetrate between the muscular fibres, then terminating in tubes of\r\n  exceeding fineness, which at first sight seem to form a network that\r\n  might well be called a _rete mirabile_. A closer examination,\r\n  however, reveals that it is not a real network, but rather an\r\n  interlacing confusing to the eye. The longitudinal direction of the\r\n  tracheæ of the muscles presents a striking contrast to the system of\r\n  divarication represented in Figs. 13 and 14. The course of the\r\n  tracheæ of the Malpighian tubes is also very curious. There is one\r\n  large trachea which winds around the tube in a long spiral, giving\r\n  off numerous small branches which run to the surface of the tube,\r\n  upon which they form delicate ramifications. Each tube has but a\r\n  single main trachea, and I think the trachea continues the whole\r\n  length of the tube, but of this last point I am not quite sure.”\r\n  (Minot.)\r\n\r\nWhile in the nymphs of Orthoptera the tracheæ very closely resemble\r\nthose of the adult, in larvæ of insects with a complete metamorphosis\r\nthe tracheæ differ very much in distribution from those of the adult.\r\nThe larval tracheæ are also more generalized and more like those of the\r\noriginal type than the tracheæ of perfect insects. (Lubbock.)\r\n\r\nIn general there are two main tracheæ, one passing along each side of\r\nthe body, near the digestive canal, connected with its mate by a few\r\ntransverse anastomosing branches, and sending off a branch to each\r\nspiracle, this arrangement being most simple and apparent in the maggots\r\nof Diptera. From these two main branches smaller twigs branch off into\r\nevery part of the body with its appendages, passing among the different\r\norgans, often serving as cables to hold them loosely in place; they also\r\npenetrate into the component parts of the organ themselves, passing into\r\nthe fat-bodies, and among the fibres of muscles, where they become\r\nfinely attenuated and refined like the capillaries of the vascular\r\nsystem of vertebrates.

Weismann states that in the larvæ of Corethra and\r\n  Chironomus the tracheal system is only incompletely developed; the\r\n  tracheæ are not united with each other, and in the youngest larvæ\r\n  they do not contain air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 397.—Tracheal system of the right side of _Machilis maritima_:\r\n    _k_, head; I, II, III, thoracic segments; 1–10, abdominal\r\n    segments; _s_, stigma.—After Oudemans, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Each of the two main tracheæ, as Kolbe states, sends off into each\r\n  segment of the body three branches.\r\n\r\n  1. An upper or dorsal branch, which supplies the muscles of the\r\n  dorsal region.\r\n\r\n  2. A middle (visceral) branch, whose twigs pass to the digestive\r\n  canal and back to the organs of reproduction.\r\n\r\n  3. A lower (ventral) branch, whose twigs are distributed to the\r\n  ganglia and to the muscles of the ventral region.\r\n\r\n  In certain Thysanura, as a species of Machilis (Fig. 397), we\r\n  probably have the primitive condition of the tracheal system, the\r\n  longitudinal and transverse anastomoses being absent, but in other\r\n  Thysanura (Japyx, Nicoletia, Lepisma, and a few species of Machilis)\r\n  they are present.\r\n\r\n  As Kolbe remarks, whether the fine ends of the tracheæ are closed or\r\n  open, whether after the analogy of the blood capillaries of\r\n  vertebrates they anastomose with each other, whether the ends of the\r\n  air-tubes pass between the cells or penetrate into them, these\r\n  questions are not fully settled. According to Leydig’s[61] latest\r\n  views the tracheæ penetrate into the cells and unite with the\r\n  hyaloplasma. Hence the process of respiration in the last instance\r\n  takes place in the hyaloplasma. This assumption accords with the\r\n  fact that in the tracheate Arthropods the terminations of the\r\n  tracheæ carry the atmospheric air into the space bounded by the\r\n  cellular network, also to the hyaloplasma filling the spaces.\r\n  Leydig[62] also thinks that the finest tracheal endings penetrate\r\n  into the muscular tissue and unite with the primitive muscular\r\n  fibres.\r\n\r\nKupffer is likewise of the opinion that the fine tracheæ penetrate into\r\nthe cells, and Lidth de Jeude asserts that they enter the epithelial\r\ncells, “each cell containing several branches.” Kölliker, Emery, etc.,\r\nmaintain, however, that the tracheal endings lie between the cells.\r\nWielowiejski,[63] in describing the line tracheæ of the phosphorescent\r\norgans, thinks that the tracheal endings (tracheal capillaries) rarely\r\nend blindly, but anastomose with one another, forming an irregular\r\nnetwork. The latest observer, Gilson (1893), asserts that tracheal twigs\r\npenetrate deeply into the epithelial cells of the silk glands of larval\r\nTrichoptera as well as of caterpillars, passing through their\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 398.—Tracheal network of the male glands of _Lampyris\r\n    splendidula_: _tec_, tracheal end-cells; _cap_, tracheal\r\n    capillaries; at _a_, an expanded matrix.—After Wielowiejski.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 399.—Tracheal capillary end-network (_tr. c. n._) of silk glands\r\n    of _Ocneria dispar_: _p_, peritoneal (peritracheal) membrane.—After\r\n    Wistinghausen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  A late investigator, C. von Wistinghausen, finds in the tracheæ of\r\n  the spinning-glands of caterpillars a completely formed network\r\n  between the terminal branches of two or several tracheal groups. The\r\n  tracheal tubes of this series of terminal branches pass into this\r\n  network, which he calls the tracheal capillary end-network (Figs.\r\n  398, 400). This last varies in thickness and spreads out under the\r\n  membrana propria of the glandular mass over the entire surface of\r\n  the large gland-cells and on a level with the tracheal capillaries.\r\n  The tracheal endings do not penetrate into the cells, but are\r\n  separated from the plasma of the cells by a thin membrane. The\r\n  tracheal capillary end-network appears as a system of fine tubes\r\n  like the tracheal capillaries, consisting of a peritoneal layer and\r\n  a chitinous intima (Fig. 400). The walls of these tubes are\r\n  homogeneous, not porous, though readily permeable by the\r\n  parenchymatous fluid. The interchange of gases consequently may go\r\n  on easier and more vigorously in a system of richly anastomosing\r\n  tubules of the net-like mass of tracheal capillaries, than in tubes\r\n  ending blindly.\r\n\r\n  While the diameter of the tracheal capillaries is 0.0016 mm. or 1 µ,\r\n  that of the tubules composing the tracheal capillary end-network is\r\n  scarcely measurable, but is less than 1 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 400.—Tracheal end-cells of _Lampyris splendidula_: _tr_,\r\n    trachea with tænidia; _tre_, tracheal capillaries.—After\r\n    Wielowiejski.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  These tracheal capillaries also occur on the seminal and other\r\n  sexual tubes, on the intestine, on the urinary tubes, on the\r\n  fat-bodies, but are most easily detected on the silk-glands.\r\n\r\n  The latest researches are those of E. Holmgren, who has studied the\r\n  branching of the tracheæ in the spinning-glands of caterpillars. He\r\n  prefers to call the end-cells “transition cells,” as they lead from\r\n  the tracheal tubes proper to the capillary network. This latter is\r\n  formed by slender nucleated cells, often with an intracellular\r\n  lumen, and, according to the author, probably constituting a\r\n  respiratory epithelium. He finds that both large and small tracheæ\r\n  may penetrate the gland-cells. (Anat. Anzeiger, xi, 1895, pp. 340–6,\r\n  3 figs.; Jour. Roy. Micr. Soc., 1896, p. 182.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _b._ The spiracles or stigmata\r\n\r\nThe spiracles are segmentally arranged openings in the sides of the\r\nthorax and abdomen, through which the air passes into the air-tubes. In\r\nits essential structure a spiracle, or _stigma_, is a slit-like opening\r\nsurrounded by a chitinous ring, the lips or edges of the opening being\r\nmembranous and closed by a movable valve of the spiracle attached by its\r\nlower edge, which is closed by an occlusor muscle (Fig. 401). The\r\naperture when open forms a narrow oval slit; and in most insects the\r\nslit is within guarded by a row of projecting spines or setæ, which form\r\na lattice work or grate to keep out dust, dirt, fluids, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 401.—Horizontal section of left third stigma and trachea of\r\n    _Melolontha vulgaris_, showing the chamber or drum leading into the\r\n    trachea: _a_, _a_, external frame or valve protecting the outer\r\n    opening of the stigma; _b_, _c_, _c_, inner frame closing the\r\n    entrance into the trachea (_l_, _k_); _m_, occlusor muscle closing\r\n    the inner orifice.—After Straus-Dürckheim.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Krancher[64] has described five leading types of stigmata, not,\r\n  however, taking into account those of the Synaptera.\r\n\r\n  I. _Stigmata without lips_ (Primitive or generalized stigmata).\r\n\r\n  _a._ The simplest stigma is an aperture which is kept open by a\r\n  chitinous ring (Acanthia). The opening may be round or elliptical.\r\n  There are no lips nor any movement of the edges to be observed. Such\r\n  air-holes occur in the abdomen of bugs (Hemiptera) and beetles\r\n  (Coleoptera); within the opening of the stigmata in the same insects\r\n  is a funnel-like contraction. Also in the Diptera the abdominal\r\n  stigmata are of the same type.[65] The stigmata of the Pulicidae\r\n  (Siphonaptera) are more complicated, as the edges of the openings\r\n  are provided with setæ (Fig. 402).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 402.—First abdominal spiracle with a part of the trachea of the\r\n    cat-flea: _sp_, spiracle; _t_, trachea.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 403.—Stigma of Melolontha larva, seen from without: _b_, bulla;\r\n    _s_, sieve-like plate; _o_, curved slit-like opening.—After Boas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  _b._ The stigma consists of a series of minute single stigmata,\r\n  which are usually surmounted by a common chitinous ring, and whose\r\n  tubular continuations unite within in a common trachea, so that the\r\n  single tubes pass off from the stigma like the fingers on the hand.\r\n  This form is found in the larvæ and puparia of Diptera.\r\n\r\n  II. _Stigmata with lips_ (Secondary more specialized stigmata).\r\n\r\n  _c._ The lips are represented by a single chitinous ring, with\r\n  sparse spines. One side of the stigma is a little higher, and partly\r\n  overlaps the other posteriorly; this form is peculiar to the\r\n  Orthoptera and Libellulidae.\r\n\r\n  _d._ The lips are roof-like, bent inwards and densely hairy, forming\r\n  a peculiar kind of felting. The setæ of the lips are in most beetles\r\n  and many Lepidoptera separate, and more or less branched. In\r\n  caterpillars, the setæ are so finely branched as to form a loose\r\n  felt, or sieve-like arrangement.\r\n\r\n  _e._ The stigmata are round, with a very broad border and a\r\n  concentric middle portion, the structure being complicated. The\r\n  concentric middle portion is pouch-like and bears the occlusor\r\n  muscle. This form occurs in the larvæ of lamellicorn beetles, and\r\n  can be seen with the naked eye, or with a lens, in Oryctes, Cetonia,\r\n  and Melolontha (Fig. 403).\r\n\r\n  _f._ Over the outer opening of the spiracle is an incurved chitinous\r\n  projection, on one side of which the trachea takes its origin. It is\r\n  thus in the Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  The remarkable grate-like stigma of the lamellicorn larvæ has the\r\n  appearance as if the outer closing plate or valve were impenetrable.\r\n  The earlier observers considered these stigmata to be open, but\r\n  Meinert regards them as closed; Schiödte, however, has observed by\r\n  pressing a preserved specimen of a Melolontha larva the alcohol\r\n  within passing out in drops, through the grate-like plate, and hence\r\n  he considers this a proof that the stigma is permeable (Kolbe).\r\n\r\n  More recently (1893) Boas has examined the same structure in the\r\n  same species of larva as examined by Schiödte, and he finds it to be\r\n  open only during the process of moulting. He finds that on each side\r\n  of the larva there are nine short and wide stigmatic branches, each\r\n  of which is shut off from the exterior by a brown plate; this\r\n  consists of a reniform sieve-plate, and of a curved bulla which fits\r\n  into the cavity of the plate. The stigmatic branch, however, is\r\n  provided with a large external opening, which is homologous with the\r\n  stigma, but which is usually closed by the plate and bulla, and is\r\n  only open during the moulting; at first it is circular, but later\r\n  becomes a cleft. A transverse section shows that the bulla is a\r\n  simple tegumentary fold, the outer chitinous layer of which has\r\n  become especially firm. The plate forms a horizontal half-roof,\r\n  which springs from one side of the tracheal orifice, and is\r\n  supported by obliquely set bases, which spring from the adjoining\r\n  part of the inner side of the tracheæ. The plate and bars are purely\r\n  cuticular structures. (Zool. Anz., 1893; also Journ. Roy. Micr.\r\n  Soc., p. 54.)\r\n\r\n  The tracheal system of libellulid nymphs is not closed; on the other\r\n  hand, in the fully-grown nymphs the anterior stigmata occurring on\r\n  the dorsal side are large, and the tracheæ arising from them are\r\n  thick. These stigmata are permeable by the air. In half-grown and\r\n  still younger stages of Æschna the two anterior thoracic stigmata\r\n  are undeveloped. In order to breathe, the fully-grown nymph either\r\n  rises up on the upper side and elevates the end of the body to the\r\n  surface in order to take the air into the rectum, or it rests with\r\n  the back of the thorax at the surface in order to breathe through\r\n  the large stigmata. The young nymphs take in air only through the\r\n  rectum. The young nymphs of Libellula and its allies, on the other\r\n  hand, possess large thoracic stigmata, but they prefer to breathe\r\n  through the rectum. The fully-grown nymphs of Agrion breathe through\r\n  the thoracic stigmata. (Dewitz, in Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n=The position and number of pairs of stigmata.=—The spiracles are\r\nusually situated in the soft membrane between the tergites and\r\npleurites, but their exact position varies in different groups. In the\r\nColeoptera they occupy on the thorax a more ventral position, and on the\r\nabdomen are placed near the edge of the dorsal side, under the elytra.\r\nIn the dragon-flies, the first pair is situated much more dorsally than\r\nthe second and third pairs; the following seven pairs are almost wholly\r\nventral and lie concealed in the membranous fold near the external\r\nplate. In the Hemiptera, also, the abdominal stigmata, though entirely\r\nfree and visible, are situated ventrally.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, in the embryo a pair of stigmata appear on each segment of\r\nthe thorax and abdomen, except the 10th and 11th, and even possibly in\r\nthe head, for a pair of stigmata are said to occur in the head of\r\nPodurids (Smynthurus) (Lubbock), though this statement needs\r\nconfirmation. Scolopendrella, however, is known to possess a pair of\r\ncephalic spiracles.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statement it will be seen that while in existing\r\nwinged insects no more than 10 (in Japyx 11) pairs of stigmata are to be\r\nfound in any one species, yet that 12 segments of the body, in different\r\ngroups taken collectively, bear them. The primitive number of pairs of\r\nspiracles, therefore, in winged insects, was 12, _i.e._ a pair in each\r\nthoracic segment, and a pair in each of the first nine abdominal\r\nsegments. Insects were originally all holopneustic, and gradually as the\r\ntype became differentiated into the different orders they became\r\nperipneustic or amphipneustic, and, in certain aquatic forms, apneustic.\r\n(See pp. 459, 461.)\r\n\r\nIn the still more primitive, probably wingless, ancestors of insects\r\nthere was a larger number of stigmata. Hatschek, in 1877, discovered a\r\npair of tracheal invaginations in each of the three posterior\r\nhead-segments of the embryo of a moth, with stigmatal openings in the\r\n1st and 2d maxillary segments.\r\n\r\nThus early in embryonic life every segment of the body, except those\r\nbearing the eyes and the last abdominal, bore a pair of stigmata, so\r\nthat the primitive insect had at least 15, and perhaps more, pairs of\r\nstigmata.\r\n\r\nThe position of the stigmata is subject to much variation, the result of\r\nadaptation to this or that mode of life. Examples are those insects\r\nwhich live in dusty situations or usually more or less concealed in the\r\nearth, as in most beetles, and in the Hymenoptera. In such beetles, the\r\nstigmata are situated in the thin membrane between the segments; in the\r\nHymenoptera, on the upper edge of the segments. In the Siphonaptera,\r\nPediculina, bed-bug, and similar forms, which breathe an air freer from\r\ndust, the spiracles lie free on the outside of the body.\r\n\r\n  “When the stigmata are free and without any protection on the\r\n  abdomen, there are other ways by which the entrance of foreign\r\n  bodies into the tracheæ is prevented. In such cases the body is\r\n  covered with dense hairs, as in most Diptera and Neuroptera, as well\r\n  as many Lepidoptera; or there is situated in front of the stigma\r\n  either a small fissure which is covered over by a number of hairs\r\n  arising from the edge, as in many Orthoptera; or, as in most\r\n  insects, a luxurious growth of hairs on the inside of the stigma\r\n  forms a thick filter for the air. Thus we see that also in this\r\n  respect each species of insect is completely adapted to its\r\n  surroundings.” (Krancher.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 404.—_A_, thoracic stigma of the house-fly: _Sb_, valve which\r\n    closes the opening.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 405.—Diagrammatic figures of the internal apparatus which closes\r\n    the trachea, in the stag-beetle: _A_, trachea open; in _B_, closed;\r\n    _St_, the stigma, with its grated lips; _Ct_, cuticula of the\r\n    body-walls; _Vk_, closing pouch; _Vbü_, closing bow; _Vba_, closing\r\n    band; _M_, occlusor muscle.—From Judeich and Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The closing apparatus of the stigma.=—Whether the external opening of\r\nthe stigma is permanently open or closed, communication with the tracheæ\r\nmay be cut off at pleasure during respiration by an internal apparatus\r\nof elastic chitinous bands and rods and the occlusor muscle.\r\n\r\nThe parts concerned in this operation are: 1. The closing bow; 2. The\r\nclosing lever or peg; 3. The closing band; 4. The occlusor muscle (Figs.\r\n405, 406).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 406.—Stigma, with the closing apparatus, of _Smerinthus populi_\r\n    (imago), seen from within: _b_, closing bow; _c_, closing band: _o_,\r\n    stigmatic opening; _r_, external chitinous ring; _l_, closing lever;\r\n    _m_, occlusor muscle; _s_, scales which lie like roofing tiles over\r\n    the stigma.—After Krancher.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The first three parts are chitinized; they form a ring around the\r\nstigmatic opening, and are united to each other by joints. The bow is\r\nusually crescentic and as a rule surrounds one-half of the trachea. On\r\nthe other side is the closing band which, by different contrivances,\r\nrepresenting the closing lever or peg, becomes closely pressed against\r\nthe closing bow. This lever is usually of the shape of a slender\r\nchitinous rod, which causes the closure; but it can also bend\r\nrectangularly, become converted into a typical lever as in the\r\nLepidoptera, or it may assume the form of two peg-like processes, which\r\npress with their base against the closing bow.” (Krancher.)\r\n\r\n“The closure of the spiracular opening is effected by the contraction of\r\nthe muscles, while the opening is due to the elasticity of the chitinous\r\nparts. When at rest the spiracle is naturally open, so that the air in\r\nthe trachea can directly communicate with the external air. Usually one\r\nend of the muscle is attached to the closing peg, and the other end to\r\nthe closing bow. Where, as in Melolontha, the closing apparatus is\r\nprovided with two levers, then naturally the muscle binds these two\r\ntogether and brings about by powerful contractions a firm closure of the\r\ntrachea”; but, remarks Krancher, “this is not the only kind; there are\r\nnumerous modifications. Besides the form just described, the levers\r\nassume the form of valves (Sirex), or of a brush (Pulex); or of a ring\r\n(larvæ of Diptera) with a circular muscle attached to it; or of a ring\r\nwhich simply becomes compressed (thoracic stigmata of Diptera).”\r\n\r\n\r\n         _c._ Morphology and homologies of the tracheal system\r\n\r\nAs first shown by Bütschli, the tracheal system is a series of\r\nsegmentally arranged tubular invaginations of the ectoderm; a pair of\r\nstigmata primitively occurring on every segment of the body except\r\nperhaps the most anterior, and the last two or last one, a reduction in\r\ntheir number having since taken place, until in the Podurans none have\r\nsurvived. In the supposed ancestor of myriopods and insects, Peripatus,\r\nthere are tracheæ; but they are very fine, simple, not-branched\r\nchitinous tubes which are united into tufts at the base of a\r\nflask-shaped depression of the integument, the outer aperture of which\r\ndepression is regarded as a stigma. In one species (_P. edwardsii_)\r\nthese tufts and their openings are scattered irregularly over the body;\r\nbut in another kind (_P. capensis_) some of the stigmata at least show\r\ntraces of a serial arrangement, being disposed in longitudinal rows—two\r\non each side, one dorsally and one ventrally, those of each row,\r\nhowever, being more numerous than the pairs of legs. (See p. 9 and Fig.\r\n4, _D_.)\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that in Peripatus, which does not possess urinary\r\ntubes, the segmental organs or nephridia are well developed, hence the\r\ntracheal tubes coexisting with them cannot be their homologues. We are\r\ntherefore compelled to regard the tracheal system as of independent\r\norigin, arising in the earliest terrestrial air-breathing arthropod, and\r\nnot indebted for its origin to any structure found in worms, unless\r\nperhaps, as both Kennell and Lang suggest, to dermal glands, since,\r\naccording to Kennell, certain Hirudinea and many Turbellarian worms\r\npossess long, mostly unicellular, glands which spread far through the\r\nparenchyma of the body. (Kennell.)\r\n\r\n  Thus Kennell supposes that the ancestors of the Tracheates had\r\n  spiracles on every segment of the body where the internal\r\n  organization allowed them to exist. “The reduction of the breathing\r\n  holes to a smaller number, and their restriction of a pair only to a\r\n  single segment, was brought about partly by adaptation to a peculiar\r\n  mode of life,—as insect larvæ especially teach us,—partly also—I may\r\n  say mechanically—as a result of the obstruction to their development\r\n  made by the growth or excessive development of other organs.” Among\r\n  these he reckons the thick, dense cuticula of the integument, the\r\n  internal fusion of several segments to form body-regions, and the\r\n  arrangement and great development of the muscles in the head and\r\n  thorax, etc. (p. 29.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 407.—Section through a tracheal pit and diverging bundles of\r\n    tracheal tubes taken transversely to the long axis of the body:\r\n    _tr_, tracheæ, showing rudimentary spiral fibre; _tr. c_, cells\r\n    resembling those lining the tracheal pits, which occur at\r\n    intervals along the course of the tracheæ; _tr. o_, tracheal\r\n    stigma; _tr. p_, tracheal pit.—After Balfour, from Sedgwick.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Kennell has suggested the origin of the tracheæ of Peripatus from\r\n  the unicellular dermal glands of annelidan ancestors, since he has\r\n  found glands in certain land-leaches of tropical America, which are\r\n  provided with enormously long tubular passages united into bundles\r\n  and opening externally, these tubes appearing to be slightly\r\n  chitinized. Fig. 407 will show the appearance of a bundle of fine\r\n  tracheal tubes of Peripatus ending at the bottom of a follicle\r\n  formed by a deep invagination of the integument, which may be\r\n  regarded as a primitive spiracle. (See Kennell, Ueber einige\r\n  Landblutegel des tropical America, Zool. Jahrb. ii, 1886; also Die\r\n  Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Arthropoden, 1891, p. 25.) We may\r\n  add that Carrière supposes from his study of the embryology of the\r\n  wall-bee (_Chalicodoma muraria_), published in 1890, that not only\r\n  the salivary glands, but also the tentorium, are homologues of the\r\n  tracheæ, while other structures than tracheæ may have evolved from\r\n  unicellular dermal glands, which are widely distributed. It may in\r\n  this connection be observed that some authors derive the book-lungs\r\n  or book-leaf tracheæ of Arachnida from the gills of Limulus; hence\r\n  if those of Arachnida arose from quite different and more\r\n  specialized organs than dermal glands, it is not impossible that the\r\n  tracheæ of Peripatus, Myriopods, and insects arose _de novo_, and\r\n  then we need not look for any primitive structures in worms from\r\n  which they arose.\r\n\r\n  Although Bütschli in 1870 in his embryology of the honey-bee called\r\n  attention to the “great similarity which the eleven pairs of\r\n  invaginations in the eleven first trunk-segments in their first\r\n  indication (_anlage_) have with the spinning-glands, and also with\r\n  the segmental organs of Annelids,” he did not go further than this,\r\n  and it is now known that in the 2d maxillary segment open not only\r\n  spinning-glands, but in the embryo a pair of stigmata.\r\n\r\n  Paul Mayer, however, regarded the tracheæ and urinary tubes as\r\n  homodynamous structures, and this view was advocated by Grassi\r\n  (1885) for the reason that while in the embryo honey-bee there are\r\n  ten pairs of stigmata, the first thoracic and two last abdominal\r\n  segments wanting them, the germs of the urinary tubes arise in a\r\n  corresponding situation on the two last abdominal segments. To this\r\n  view Emery (Biol. Centralb., 1886, p. 692) objects that in Peripatus\r\n  the nephridia and tracheæ “have nothing to do with the segmental\r\n  organs,” as Peripatus besides nephridia possesses both coxal glands\r\n  and tracheæ.\r\n\r\n  Both Kennell and Lang derive the coxal glands of Arthropoda from the\r\n  setiparous or parapodial glands of annelid worms, and the recent\r\n  endeavor of Bernard to show that the tracheæ arose from setiparous\r\n  glands seems to be disproved by the fact that in insects as well as\r\n  in other Arthropoda coxal glands with their outlets exist in the\r\n  same segments as those bearing stigmata. Reasoning by exclusion, we\r\n  are led to regard Kennell’s original view as the soundest.\r\n\r\n  Patten, however, regards the tracheæ as modified ends of nephridia,\r\n  remarking: “Since in Acilius some of the abdominal tracheæ at first\r\n  communicate with the cavities of the mesoblastic somites, it is\r\n  probable that all the tracheæ represent the ectodermic portions of\r\n  the nephridia.” (Origin of Vertebrates from Arachnids, p. 355.)\r\n\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that the tracheæ first arose as modifications\r\nof dermal glands, as in mites and Peripatus, and that at first they were\r\nnot provided with tænidia (as in Chilopoda), while in later forms\r\ntænidia were developed. In the earliest tracheate forms the stigmata\r\nwere not segmentally arranged, probably appearing irregularly anywhere\r\nin the body, but afterwards in the myriopods and insects became serially\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _d._ The spiral threads or tænidia\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the so-called “spiral thread” forms a\r\ncontinuous thread from one end of a tracheal branch to the other. This\r\nwas first shown not to be the case by Platner in 1844. Minot has proved\r\nthat “there is not a single spiral thread, but several, which run\r\nparallel to one another and end after making a few turns around the\r\ntrachea.”\r\n\r\nThe tænidia we have found to be in some cases separate, independent,\r\nsolid rings, though when there is more than one turn the thread\r\nnecessarily becomes spiral. The tænidia of a main branch stop at the\r\norigin of the smaller branches, and a new set begins at the origin of\r\neach branch. The tænidia at the origin of the branch do not pass\r\nentirely around the inside of the peritoneal membrane; in the axils they\r\nare short, separate, spindle-shaped bands (Fig. 409).\r\n\r\n  At one point in the main trachea of the larva of Datana the tænidia\r\n  were seen to end singly on one side (at a considerable distance from\r\n  any branch or axil) at intervals, with a tænidium situated between\r\n  them, making four or five turns; then there is only one band\r\n  situated between two ends; this band or thread is succeeded by a set\r\n  with five turns between the two ends, this set being succeeded by\r\n  one complete ring situated between two ends; in all cases the ends\r\n  vary in length, some threads being short and others long, so that\r\n  they apparently end anywhere along the circumference of the trachea,\r\n  and this arrangement is seen to apparently extend along the whole\r\n  length of the trachea. Hence it is seen that as a rule the tænidia\r\n  vary much in length, and never, as generally supposed, pass\r\n  continuously from one end to another of a tracheal branch, for there\r\n  are many spirals in a branch, each making only from one to five\r\n  turns, most usually four turns. Fig. 408, part of a trachea of\r\n  _Dyticus marginatus_, shows that at a slight bend in a trachea the\r\n  tænidia is interrupted, and short, incomplete, wedge-shaped tænidia\r\n  (_e_) are interpolated; at _A_, _d_ is seen a split in one of the\r\n  tænidia (compare also MacLeod, Pl. 1, Fig. 9). The threads are quite\r\n  irregular in width. In the axils of the branches there is, as seen\r\n  in Fig. 409, a basketwork of independent, short, often\r\n  spindle-shaped tænidia; these are succeeded by longer ones, until we\r\n  have threads passing entirely around near the base of each new\r\n  branch; these being succeeded by others which make from two to five\r\n  spiral turns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 408.—Tænidia of Dyticus: _d_, a split tænidium; _e_, _e_, ends of\r\n    tænidia.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the tænidia appears to vary to a great extent. In\r\nlepidopterous insects we have observed them to be in their general shape\r\nrather flat and slightly concavo-convex, the hollow looking towards the\r\ncentre of the trachea. Minot’s section (Fig. 393) shows that in\r\nHydrophilus they are cylindrical and solid, and Chun states that those\r\nof Stratiomys are round, while in Eristalis they are round, with a ridge\r\nprojecting into the cavity of the trachea; in Æschna the thread is\r\nquadrangular. MacLeod states that sometimes it is cylindrical, in other\r\ncases flat, likewise prismatic; Macloskie believes that the spiral\r\nthreads of the centipede are “fine tubules, externally opening by a\r\nfissure along their course.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 409.—Tænidia of Dyticus in an axil of two branches: _e_, _e_,\r\n    ends of tænidia.\r\n]\r\n\r\nStokes confirms Macloskie’s statements, stating that in the hemipterous\r\n_Zaitha fluminea_ “the tænidia are fissured tubules formed within and\r\nfrom chitinized folds of the intima, the convexity of the folds looking\r\ntowards the lumen of the tracheæ.” In Fig. 414, 1, are represented\r\nportions of several tænidia showing the fissure, which is sometimes\r\ninterrupted; at 2 are seen “the formation of what may be called\r\napertures in a chitinous bridge.” Stokes regards the tænidia as\r\n“inwardly directed folds of the membrane.” Near the spiracles the\r\ntracheal membrane is externally studded with minute papillæ, as shown at\r\n3, where are represented three broad and incomplete tænidia, with the\r\ntapering end, or the beginning, of another. Stokes adds, “Here they are\r\nonly broad grooves, with no appearance of the narrow fissure of the\r\ncompleted tænidium. At 4 is figured a portion of the internal surface of\r\na large trachea near the external orifice, the tænidia being in an\r\nincipient stage, evidently forming more or less of a network, as is\r\nusually the case next to the stigma” (compare p. 451, and Fig. 414).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 410.—End of salivary duct in base of proboscis of _Stomoxys\r\n    calcitrans_: _a_, incomplete and irregular tænidia; _b_, two tænidia\r\n    making incomplete rings near the distal end of the duct.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The tracheæ of chilopod myriopods appear to be like those of\r\n  insects. A number of authors have failed to detect the spiral\r\n  threads in the Julidæ. As to the Arachnida, several observers,\r\n  including Menge and Bertkau, have denied the existence of the spiral\r\n  thread in the spiders with the exception of the Attidæ; and MacLeod\r\n  finds them “scarcely visible” in Argyroneta.\r\n\r\nBesides the tracheæ, the salivary duct is kept permanently distended by\r\ntænidia, which, however, are not spiral. They usually form incomplete\r\nrings, as in Stomoxys, arranged as shown in Fig. 410.\r\n\r\nThe labella (proboscis) of flies are supported by incomplete chitinous\r\ntubes or “pseudo-tracheæ,” the ends of which form the scraping teeth,\r\nthis being, according to Dimmock, their primary function. Dimmock\r\ndescribes them as cylindrical channels opening on the surface in zigzag\r\nslits. These channels are held open by incomplete rings, one end of\r\nwhich is forked. “These rings are apparently arranged so that one has\r\nits fork on one side of the opening of the channel, the next ring the\r\nfork on the opposite side of the channel, and so on, in alternation.\r\nTheir true structure is revealed when flattened out.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 411.—Abdominal spiracle (left side) of cockroach (_P.\r\n    americana_), side view, showing the bow: _p_, lateral pouch of\r\n    spiracle (in centre) seen from within. The tessellated structure of\r\n    spiracle and trachea shown at _A_, and the margin of the external\r\n    aperture at _B_.—After Miall and Denny.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe use of the elastic tænidia is to render the tracheæ elastic, and to\r\nkeep them permanently open, as is the case with the parallel rings of\r\nthe trachea of the higher vertebrates. The tracheæ are thus rendered\r\nfirm and solid, at the least expense of chitinous material. The spiral\r\nthread, as MacLeod remarks, “is the realization in nature of what\r\nengineers call a form of the greatest resistance.”\r\n\r\n  The tænidia are wanting in the fine endings of the tracheæ (tracheal\r\n  capillaries); also in the cockroach, according to Miall and Denny,\r\n  they are not developed in the large tracheæ close to the spiracles,\r\n  and the intima or wall of the tube has a tessellated instead of a\r\n  spiral marking (Fig. 411). The same structure is seen in the Perlidæ\r\n  (Nemoura, Gerstaecker, Zeit. f. wissen. Zool. xxiv, Taf. xxiii,\r\n  Figs. 5 and 7); also in Æschna (Hagen, Zool. Anz. 1880, p. 159). In\r\n  certain fine tracheæ of the eyes of the fly no spiral threads are\r\n  developed. (Hickson.) The air-sacs or dilated tracheæ are also\r\n  without tænidia.\r\n\r\nWhile in the living insect the main and smaller tracheæ are filled, with\r\nair, it is stated by Von Wistinghausen that the fine capillary ends\r\ncontain a fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _e._ Origin of the tracheæ and of the “spiral thread”\r\n\r\nWhile we owe to Bütschli the discovery of the mode of origin and\r\nmorphology of the tracheæ, which as he has shown[66] arise by\r\ninvaginations of the ectoblast; there being originally a single layer of\r\nepiblastic cells concerned in the formation of the tracheæ; we are\r\nindebted to Weismann[67] for the discovery of the mode of origin of the\r\n“intima,” from the epiblastic layer of cells forming the primitive\r\nfoundation of the tracheal structure.\r\n\r\n  Weismann did not observe the earliest steps in the process of\r\n  formation of the stigma and main trunk of the tracheæ, which\r\n  Bütschli afterwards clearly described and figured.\r\n\r\n  Weismann, however, thus describes the mode of development of the\r\n  intima; after describing the cells destined to form the peritoneal\r\n  membrane, he says: “The lumen is filled with a clear fluid and\r\n  already shows a definite border in a slight thickening of the\r\n  cell-wall next to it.\r\n\r\n  “Very soon this thickening forms a thin, structureless intima, which\r\n  passes as a delicate double line along the cells, and shows its\r\n  dependence on the cells by a sort of adherence to the rounded sides\r\n  of the cells (Taf. vii, 97 _A_, _a b c_). Throughout the mass, as\r\n  the intima thickens, the cells lose their independence, their walls\r\n  pressing together and coalescing, and soon the considerably enlarged\r\n  hollow cylinder of the intima is surrounded by a homogeneous layer\r\n  of a tissue, whose origin from cells is recognized only by the\r\n  regular position of the rounded nuclei (Taf. vii, Fig. 97, _B_).\r\n\r\n  “Then as soon as the wavy bands of the intima entirely disappear,\r\n  and it forms a straight, cylindrical tube, a fine pale\r\n  cross-striation becomes noticeable (vii, 97, _B_, _int_), which\r\n  forms the well-known ‘spiral thread,’ a structure which, as Leydig\r\n  has shown, possesses no independence, but arises merely from a\r\n  partial thickening of the originally homogeneous intima.\r\n\r\n  “Meyer’s idea that the spiral threads are fissures in the intima\r\n  produced by the entrance of air is disproved by the fact that the\r\n  spiral threads are present long before the air enters. Hence the\r\n  correctness of Leydig’s view, based on the histological structure of\r\n  the tracheæ, is confirmed by the embryological development, and the\r\n  old idea of three membranes, which both Meyer and Milne-Edwards\r\n  maintain, must be given up.”\r\n\r\n  Weismann also contends that the elastic membrane bearing the “spiral\r\n  thread” is in no sense a primary membrane, not corresponding\r\n  histologically to a cellular membrane. On the contrary, the\r\n  “peritoneal membrane comprises the primary element of the trachea;\r\n  it is nowhere absent, but envelops the smallest branches, as well as\r\n  the largest trunks, only varying in thickness, which in the embryo\r\n  and the young larva of Musca stands in relation to the thickness of\r\n  the lumen.”\r\n\r\nThe trachea, then, consists primarily of an epithelial layer, the\r\n“peritoneal membrane,” or the invaginated epiblast; from this layer an\r\nintima is secreted, just as the skin or cuticle is secreted by the\r\nhypodermis. We may call the peritoneal membrane the _ectotrachea_, the\r\nintima or inner layer derived from the ectotrachea the _endotrachea_.\r\nThe so-called “spiral threads” are a thickening of the endotracheal\r\nmembrane, sometimes arranged in a spiral manner. For these chitinous\r\nbands we have proposed the name _tænidia_ (Greek, little bands).\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the spiral thread our observations[68] have been\r\nmade on the caterpillar of a species of Datana, which was placed in\r\nalcohol, just before pupation, when the larva was in a semipupal\r\ncondition, and the larval skin could be readily stripped off. At this\r\ntime the ectotrachea of the larva had undergone histolysis, nothing\r\nremaining but the moulted endotrachea, represented by the tænidia, which\r\nlay loosely within the cavity of the trachea. The ectotrachea or\r\nperitoneal membrane of the pupa is meanwhile in process of formation;\r\nthe nuclear origin of the tænidia is now very apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 412.—Longitudinal section of a trachea, showing the origin of the\r\n    tænidia.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 413.—Origin of the tænidia from nuclei.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 412 represents a longitudinal section through a secondary tracheal\r\nbranch, showing the origin of the chitinous bands, or tænidia. At _t′_\r\nare pieces of six tænidia which have been moulted; _ectr_ indicates the\r\nnuclei forming the outer cellular layer, the ectotrachea or peritoneal\r\nmembrane. These nuclei send long slender prolongations around the inside\r\nof the peritoneal membrane; these prolongations, as may be seen by the\r\nfigure, become the tænidia. The tænidia, being closely approximate, grow\r\ntogether more or less, and a thin endotracheal membrane is thus\r\nproduced, of which the tænidia are the thickened band-like portions. The\r\nendotracheal membrane is thus derived from the ectotrachea, or primitive\r\ntracheal membrane, and the so-called “spiral thread” is formed by\r\nthickenings of the nuclei composing the secondary layer of nuclei, and\r\nwhich become filled with the chitin secreted by these elongated nuclei.\r\nThe middle portion of the tænidia, immediately after the moult, is clear\r\nand transparent, with obscure minute granules, while the nuclear base of\r\nthe cell is filled as usual with abundant granules, and contains a\r\ndistinct nucleolus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 414.—Tænidia and internal hairs of _Zaitha_.—After Stokes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the tænidia is also well shown by Fig. 413, which is\r\nlikewise a longitudinal section of a trachea at the point of origin of a\r\nbranch. The peritracheal membrane or ectotrachea (_ectr_) is composed of\r\nlarge granulated nuclei; and within are the more transparent\r\nendotracheal cells; at _t′_ are fragments of the moulted tænidia. The\r\nnew tænidia are in process of development at _t_; at base they are seen\r\nto be granulated nuclei, with often a distinct nucleolus, each sending a\r\nlong, slender, transparent, pointed process along the inside of the\r\ntrachea. These unite to form the chitinous bands or spiral threads.\r\n\r\n=Internal hair-like bodies.=—In the large tracheæ of Lampyris very fine\r\nchitinous bristles project free into the cavity of the tube\r\n(Gerstaecher), while according to Leydig there are similar chitinous\r\npoints in the tracheæ of the Carabid beetle Procrustes. Dugardin had\r\npreviously (1849) called attention to such hairs, giving a list of the\r\ninsects in which he observed them. Emery figures a section of the\r\ntracheæ of Luciola, “in wendig behaart.”[69] Stokes has described those\r\nof _Zaitha fluminea_ (Fig. 414) as “internal chitinous, hair-like bodies\r\narising from the fold of the tænidia and projecting into the lumen of\r\nthe tubes.” They are hollow, their minute cavity distinctly\r\ncommunicating with that of the tænidium, from which they arise by an\r\nenlarged base. They end in an exceedingly fine point which is\r\noccasionally bifid or trifid. In Fig. 414, 4, several are shown attached\r\nto the wrinkles of the tracheæ near a spiracle, and at 5 is represented\r\na transverse section of a trachea with three hairs projecting into its\r\ncavity.[70]\r\n\r\n  Stokes has also described “certain minute, elliptical bodies in the\r\n  tænidia, each with an internal, presumably glandular, appendage, to\r\n  all appearance forming part of the tænidium from which it springs.”\r\n  These are shown in Fig. 414, at 1, 3, and, more in detail, at 6;\r\n  those at 7, whose thickness is about 1⁄8000 of an inch, appear as\r\n  collections of exceedingly minute, rounded apertures in a\r\n  cushion-like mass. Although not commonly occurring on the tracheal\r\n  membrane between the tænidia, they may be found there, as at 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _f._ The mechanism of respiration and the respiratory movements of\r\n                                insects\r\n\r\nBy holding a locust in the hand one may observe the ordinary mode of\r\nbreathing in insects. During this act the portion of the side of the\r\nbody between the stigmata and the pleurum contracts and expands; the\r\ncontraction of this region causes the spiracles to open. The general\r\nmovement is caused by the sternal moving much more decidedly than the\r\ntergal portion of the abdomen. When the pleural portion of the abdomen\r\nis forced out, the soft pleural membranous region under the fore and\r\nhind wings contracts, as does the tympanum, or ear, and the membranous\r\nportions at the base of the hind legs. When the tergum or dorsal portion\r\nof the abdomen falls, and the pleurum contracts, the spiracles open;\r\ntheir opening is nearly but not always exactly coördinated with the\r\ncontractions of the pleurum, but as a rule they are. There were 65\r\ncontractions in a minute in a locust which had been held between the\r\nfingers about ten minutes. It was noticed that when the abdomen\r\nexpanded, the air-sacs in the first abdominal ring contracted.\r\n\r\nFor expanding the abdomen no special muscles are required, since it\r\nexpands by the elasticity of the parts. For contracting its walls there\r\nare two sets of muscles, viz., special vertical expiratory muscles\r\nserving to compress or flatten the abdomen (Figs. 415–418), and other\r\nmuscles which draw together or telescope the segments.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that when the abdomen contracted the air was\r\nexpelled from the body and the tracheæ emptied; that, when the abdomen\r\nagain expanded by its own elasticity, the air-tubes were refilled, and\r\nthat no other mechanism was needed. But Landois insisted that this was\r\nnot enough; as Miall and Denny state: “Air must be forced into the\r\nfurthest recesses of the tracheal system, where the exchange of oxygen\r\nand carbonic acid is effected more readily than in tubes lined by a\r\ndense intima. But in these fine and intricate passages the resistance to\r\nthe passage of air is considerable, and the renewal of the air could, to\r\nall appearance, hardly be effected at all if the inlets remained open.\r\nLandois accordingly searched for some means of closing the outlets, and\r\nfound an elastic ring or spiral, which surrounds the tracheal tube\r\nwithin the spiracle.” By means of the occlusor muscle this ring\r\ncompresses the tube, “like a spring clip upon a flexible gas-pipe.”\r\n“When the muscle contracts, the passage is closed, and the abdominal\r\nmuscles can then, it is supposed, bring any needful pressure to bear\r\nupon the tracheal tubes, much in the same way as with ourselves, when we\r\nclose the mouth and nostrils, and then, by forcible contraction of the\r\ndiaphragm and abdominal walls, distend the cheeks or pharynx.”\r\n\r\nThus an important point in the respiration of tracheate animals, whether\r\ninsects, myriopods, or arachnids, is, as Landois claimed, the closure of\r\nthe spiracles, in order that pressure may be brought upon the air in the\r\ntubes, so that it may pass onward into the finest terminations.\r\n\r\nThe injection of air by muscular pressure into a system of very fine\r\ntubes may, as Miall and Denny remark, appear extremely difficult or even\r\nimpossible. Graham (Researches, p. 44) applies the law of diffusion of\r\ngases to explain the respiration of insects, but until physical\r\nexperiments have been made, we may, with Miall and Denny, “be satisfied\r\nthat an appreciable quantity of air may be made by muscular pressure to\r\nflow along even the finer air-passages of an insect.”\r\n\r\nAs to the respiratory movements of insects, Plateau is the principal\r\nauthority, and the following account of the process is taken from his\r\nelaborate memoir, and from the statements afterwards contributed by him\r\nto Miall and Denny’s “The Cockroach.”\r\n\r\nAlthough many observers have superficially described the respiratory\r\nmovements of various insects, Rathke was the first one to state precise\r\nviews as to the mechanism of respiration. His posthumous work, treating\r\nof the respiratory movements of the movable chitinous plates of the\r\nabdomen, and of the respiratory muscles characteristic of all the\r\nprincipal groups, filled an important blank in our knowledge. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the skill displayed in this research, many questions\r\nstill remain unanswered which require more exact methods than mere\r\nobservations with the naked eye or the simple lens.\r\n\r\nPlateau, who was followed a year later by Langendorff, conceived the\r\nidea of studying, by such graphic methods as are now familiar, the\r\nrespiratory movements of perfect insects.\r\n\r\n  “He has made use of two modes of investigation. The first, or\r\n  graphic method, in the strict sense of the term, consisted in\r\n  recording, upon a revolving cylinder of smoked paper, the\r\n  respiratory movements, transmitted by means of very light levers of\r\n  Bristol board attached to any part of the insect’s exoskeleton.\r\n  Unfortunately, this plan is only applicable to insects of more than\r\n  average size. A second method, that of projection, consisted in\r\n  introducing the insect, carried upon a small support, into a large\r\n  magic lantern fitted with a good petroleum lamp. When the\r\n  amplification does not exceed 12 diameters, a sharp profile may be\r\n  obtained, upon which the actual displacements may be measured, true\r\n  to the fraction of a millimetre. Placing a sheet of white paper upon\r\n  the lantern screen, the outlines of the profile are carefully traced\r\n  in pencil so as to give two superposed figures, representing the\r\n  phases of inspiration and expiration respectively. By altering the\r\n  position of the insect so as to obtain profiles of transverse\r\n  sections, or of the different parts of the body, and, further, by\r\n  gluing very small paper slips to parts whose movements are hard to\r\n  observe, the successive positions of the slips being then drawn,\r\n  complete information is at last obtained of every detail of the\r\n  respiratory movements; nothing is lost.”\r\n\r\n  “This method, similar to that employed by the English physiologist,\r\n  Hutchinson,[71] is valuable, because it enables us, with a little\r\n  practice, to investigate readily the respiratory movements of very\r\n  small arthropods, such as flies or lady-birds. It has this advantage\r\n  over all others, that it leaves no room for errors of\r\n  interpretation.”\r\n\r\n  “Not satisfied with mere observation by such means as these, of the\r\n  respiratory movements of insects, the writer has also studied the\r\n  muscles concerned, and, in common with other physiologists (Faivre,\r\n  Barlow, Luchsinger, Dönhoff, and Langendorff), has examined the\r\n  action of the various nervous centres upon the respiratory organs.\r\n  The result at which he has arrived may be summarized as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 415.—Muscles of right half of the abdomen of _Forficula\r\n    auricularia_: _A_, _a_, longitudinal tergal and sternal muscles;\r\n    _D_, _E_, oblique muscles; _a_ (in upper figure) vertical\r\n    expirator muscles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “1. There is no close relation between the character of the\r\n  respiratory movements of an insect and its systematic position.\r\n  Respiratory movements are similar only when the arrangement of the\r\n  abdominal segments, and especially when the disposition of the\r\n  attached muscles, are almost identical. Thus, for example, the\r\n  respiratory movements of the cockroach are different from those of\r\n  other Orthoptera, resembling those of the heteropterous Hemiptera.\r\n  Those of the Trichoptera are like those of the aculeate Hymenoptera,\r\n  while the Locustidæ ally themselves in respect to these movements\r\n  with the Neuroptera and Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  “2. The respiratory movements of insects, when at rest, are\r\n  localized in the abdomen. As graphically stated by Graber, in\r\n  insects the chest is placed at the hinder end of the body. If\r\n  thoracic respiratory movements exist, they do not depend on the\r\n  action of special muscles.\r\n\r\n  “3. In most cases the thoracic segments do not share in the\r\n  respiratory movements of an insect at rest. The respiratory\r\n  displacements of the posterior segments of the thorax are, however,\r\n  less rare than Rathke believed. Plateau has observed them in certain\r\n  Coleoptera (Staphylinus, Chlorophanus, Corymbites), and they are\r\n  more feebly manifested in Hydrophilus, Carabus, and Tenebrio. Among\r\n  the singular exceptions to this rule is the cockroach (_Periplaneta\r\n  orientalis_), in which the terga of the meso- and metathoracic\r\n  segments perform movements exactly opposite in direction to those of\r\n  the abdomen (Fig. 419).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 416.—Muscles of the left half of abdomen of _Staphylinus\r\n    olens_; _A_, _B_, longitudinal dorsal muscles; _D_, _E_, oblique\r\n    fascia; _a_, longitudinal sternal muscles; _d_, respiratory\r\n    muscles (vertical expirators).\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “4. Leaving out of account all details and all exceptions, the\r\n  respiratory movements of insects may be said to consist of the\r\n  alternate contraction and recovery of the figure of the abdomen in\r\n  two dimensions, viz. vertical and transverse. During expiration both\r\n  diameters are reduced, while during inspiration they revert to their\r\n  previous amounts. The transverse expiratory contraction is often\r\n  slight, and may be imperceptible. On the other hand, the vertical\r\n  expiratory contraction is never absent, and usually marked. In the\r\n  cockroach (_P. orientalis_) it amounts to one-eighth of the depth of\r\n  the abdomen (between segments 2 and 3); in _Eristalis tenax_ to\r\n  one-ninth (at the 2d segment).\r\n\r\n  “5. Three principal types of respiratory mechanism occur in insects,\r\n  and these admit of further subdivision:\r\n\r\n  “_a._ Sterna usually short and very convex, yielding but little.\r\n  Terga mobile, rising and sinking appreciably. To this class belong\r\n  all Coleoptera, heteropterous Hemiptera, and Blattina (Fig. 420).\r\n\r\n  “In the cockroach (Periplaneta), the sterna are slightly raised\r\n  during expiration (Fig. 421).\r\n\r\n  “_b._ Terga well developed, overlapping the sterna on the sides of\r\n  the body, and usually concealing the pleural membrane, which forms a\r\n  sunken fold. The terga and sterna approach and recede alternately,\r\n  the sterna being almost always the more mobile. To this type belong\r\n  Odonata, Diptera, aculeate Hymenoptera, and acrydian Orthoptera\r\n  (Fig. 422).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 417.-Muscles of right half of abdomen of _Phryganea striata_,\r\n    ♀: _A_, _B_, longitudinal dorsal muscles; _a_, _b_, longitudinal\r\n    sternal muscles; _D_, _e_, oblique muscles; 1, 2, inspirator\r\n    muscles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “_c._ The pleural membrane, connecting the terga with the sterna, is\r\n  well developed and exposed on the sides of the body. The terga and\r\n  sterna approach and recede alternately, while the pleural zone\r\n  simultaneously becomes depressed, or returns to its original figure.\r\n  To this type, Plateau assigns the Locustidæ, Lepidoptera, and the\r\n  true Neuroptera (excluding Trichoptera) (Fig. 423).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 418.—Muscles of left half of abdomen of Melolontha, ♀: _A_,\r\n    _B_, longitudinal muscles (prétracteurs of Straus); _a_, _a_, true\r\n    respiratory muscles (expirators).—This and Figs. 415–417, after\r\n    Plateau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “6. Contrary to the opinion once general, changes in length of the\r\n  abdomen, involving protrusion of the segments and subsequent\r\n  retraction, are rare in the normal respiration of insects. Such\r\n  longitudinal movements extend throughout one entire group only, viz.\r\n  the aculeate Hymenoptera. Isolated examples occur, however, in other\r\n  zoölogical groups.\r\n\r\n  “7. Among insects, such as large beetles, Locustidæ, dragon-flies,\r\n  etc., sufficiently powerful to give good graphic tracings, it can be\r\n  shown that the inspiratory movement is slower than the expiratory,\r\n  and that the latter is often sudden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 419.—Profile of trunk of cockroach (_P. orientalis_). The black\r\n    surface represents the expiratory contour, while the inspiratory\r\n    is indicated by a thin line. The arrows show the direction of the\r\n    expiratory movement: _Ms. th_, mesothorax; _Mt. th_, metathorax.\r\n    Reduced from a magic-lantern projection.—After Plateau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “8. In most insects, contrary to what obtains in mammals, only the\r\n  expiratory movement is active; inspiration is passive, and effected\r\n  by the elasticity of the body-wall.\r\n\r\n  “9. Most insects possess expiratory muscles only. Certain Diptera\r\n  (_Calliphora vomitoria_ and _Eristalis tenax_) afford the simplest\r\n  arrangement of the expiratory muscles. In these types, they form a\r\n  muscular sheet of vertical fibres, connecting the terga with the\r\n  sterna, and underlying the soft, elastic membrane which unites the\r\n  hard parts of the somites. One of the most frequent complications\r\n  arises by the differentiations of this sheet of vertical fibres into\r\n  distinct muscles, repeated in every segment, and becoming more and\r\n  more separated as the sterna increase in length. Special inspiratory\r\n  muscles occur in Hymenoptera, Acridiidæ, and Trichoptera.\r\n\r\n  “10. The abdominal, respiratory movements of insects are wholly\r\n  reflex. Like other physiologists who have examined this side of the\r\n  question, Plateau finds that the respiratory movements persist in a\r\n  decapitated insect, as also after destruction of the cerebral\r\n  ganglia or œsophageal connectives; further, that in insects whose\r\n  nervous system is not highly concentrated (_e.g._ Acridiidæ and\r\n  dragon-flies), the respiratory movements persist in the completely\r\n  detached abdomen; while all external influences which promote an\r\n  increased respiratory activity in the uninjured animal, have\r\n  precisely the same action upon insects in which the anterior,\r\n  nervous centres have been removed, upon the detached abdomen, and\r\n  even upon isolated sections of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n  “The view formerly advocated by Faivre, that the metathoracic\r\n  ganglia play the part of special, respiratory centres, must be\r\n  entirely abandoned. All carefully performed experiments on the\r\n  nervous system of Arthropoda have shown that each ganglion of the\r\n  ventral chain is a motor centre, and, in insects, a respiratory\r\n  centre, for the somite to which it belongs. This is what Barlow\r\n  calls the ‘self-sufficiency’ of the ganglia.” (Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 420.—Transverse section of abdomen of a lamellicorn beetle. The\r\n    position of the terga and sterna after an inspiration is indicated\r\n    by the thick line; the dotted line shows their position after an\r\n    expiration; and the arrow marks the direction of the expiratory\r\n    movement.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 421.—Cross-section of abdomen of cockroach.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 422.—Cross-section of abdomen of bee (Bombus).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 423.—Cross-section of abdomen of Sphinx.—This and Figs. 420–422\r\n    after Plateau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Plateau has made similar observations upon the respiration of\r\n  spiders and scorpions; but, to his great surprise, he was unable,\r\n  either by direct observation, or by the graphic method, or by\r\n  projection, to discover the slightest respiratory movement of the\r\n  exterior of the body. This can only be explained by supposing that\r\n  inspiration and expiration in pulmonate Arachnida are\r\n  “intrapulmonary,” and affect only the proper, respiratory organs.\r\n  The fact is less surprising because of the wide zoölogical\r\n  separation between Arachnida and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _g._ The air-sacs\r\n\r\nIn flying insects the tracheæ are in certain parts of the body enlarged\r\ninto sacs of various sizes. These air-sacs were first observed by\r\nSwammerdam in a beetle (Geotrupes) and afterwards by Sir John Hunter in\r\nthe bee, Sprengel subsequently discovering them in other insects. Those\r\nof the cockroach were described and illustrated in a very elaborate and\r\ndetailed way by Straus-Dürckheim (Figs. 424 and 425). These vesicles are\r\nwithout tænidia. In the locust (_M. femur-rubrum_) there is a pair of\r\nvery large vesicles in the prothorax (Fig. 396). The five pairs of large\r\nabdominal air-sacs arise, independently of the main tracheæ, directly\r\nfrom branches originating from the spiracles. All these large sacs are\r\nsuperficial, lying directly beneath the hypodermis, while the smaller\r\nones are buried among the muscles. We have detected 53 of these vesicles\r\nin the head.\r\n\r\nIn the honey-bee (Fig. 426) and humble bee (Fig. 427) as well as the\r\nflies there are two enormous air-sacs at the base of the abdomen. In\r\nlarval and wingless insects these sacs are entirely absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 424.—Thorax and abdomen of the cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\n    vulgaris_), showing the tracheæ and air-sacs.—This and Fig. 425\r\n    after Straus-Dürckheim.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The use of the air-sacs.=—It was supposed by Hunter as well as by\r\nNewport, and the view has been generally held, that the use of these\r\nsacs is to lighten the weight, _i.e._ lessen the specific gravity of the\r\nbody during flight. It has, however, been suggested to us by A. A.\r\nPackard that this view from the standpoint of physics is incorrect. It\r\nis evident that the wings have to support just as much weight when the\r\ninsect is flying, whether the tracheæ and vesicles are filled with air\r\nor not, the body of the insect during flight not being lightened by the\r\nair in the sacs. The use of these numerous sacs, some of them very\r\nspacious, is to afford a greater supply of air or oxygen than that\r\ncontained in the air-tubes alone, and thus to afford a greater breathing\r\ncapacity. The sacs are largest in dragon-flies, moths, flies, and bees,\r\nwhich are swift of flight. When we compare the active movements of these\r\ninsects on the wing with those of a caterpillar or maggot, it will be\r\nseen that the far greater muscular exertions of the volant insect create\r\na demand for a sudden and abundant supply of air to correspond to the\r\nincreased rapidity of respiration; and the enlargements of the\r\nair-tubes, rapidly filled with air at each inspiration, render it\r\npossible to supply the demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 425.—Head of _Melolontha vulgaris_, showing the numerous\r\n    air-sacs, represented only on the left side, front view.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 426.—Tracheal, nervous, and digestive systems of the honey-bee\r\n    (the tracheal system on the right side only partially drawn): _tb_,\r\n    the large vesicles in the abdomen; _st_, stigmata; _hm_, honey\r\n    stomach; _cm_, chyle stomach; _vm_, urinary tubes; _rd_, rectal\r\n    glands; _ed_, rectum; _a_, antenna; _an_, eye; _b_{1}_-_b_{3}_,\r\n    legs.—After Leuckart, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The case is thus seen to be very different from that of those fishes\r\n  which, having a swimming-bladder, can in the water change the\r\n  specific gravity of their bodies. The case of insects is almost\r\n  exactly paralleled by that of birds, where, as stated by\r\n  Wiedersheim, the air-sacs appear to form integral parts of the\r\n  respiratory apparatus: “a greater amount of air can by their means\r\n  pass in and out during inspiration and expiration, especially\r\n  through the larger bronchi, and consequently there is less necessity\r\n  for the expansion of the lung parenchyma.” In other words, the\r\n  supply of air in these sacs, as in insects, increases the breathing\r\n  capacity of the bird during flight. Wiedersheim’s retention of the\r\n  old idea that the specific gravity of the body is lessened (p. 262)\r\n  seems, however, to be incorrect, as the weight of the bird’s body is\r\n  not diminished by the air contained in the sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _h._ The closed or partly closed tracheal system\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 427.—The lateral and lower series of sacs of _Bombus terrestris_,\r\n    ♂: _a_, _c_, longitudinal tracheæ;, connected by _b_, and dilated at\r\n    _f_, and again in the succeeding segments; _i_, _k_, funnel-shaped\r\n    dilatations passing over the dorsal surface of the abdomen and\r\n    anastomosing (_g_) with their fellows opposite; at _l_,\r\n    communicating directly by a large branch.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are two chief morphological tracheal systems: 1. The open or\r\nnormal and primitive (_holopneustic_) type, and 2. The closed, or\r\nsecondary and adaptive, _i.e._ _apneustic_, type. The open system is\r\ncharacterized by the presence of the stigmata. Through them the air\r\ndirectly enters into the tracheal tubes, whose delicate walls allow the\r\nexchange of gases in the blood. This type occurs in all sexually mature\r\nindividuals, and also in the greater number of larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe closed or apneustic tracheal system is distinguished either by the\r\nwant of stigmata, or, if present, they are not open, and do not\r\nfunction, so that the tracheæ cannot communicate with the air. In such\r\ncases the direct oxygenation of the blood is effected through the\r\ndelicate integument, especially over the surface of the body in general,\r\nor in certain specialized places where the gill-like expansions of the\r\nskin are rich in tracheæ; such outgrowths, generally tubular or\r\nleaf-like, are called by Palmén _tracheal gills_.\r\n\r\nThis closed form of the tracheal system only occurs in the larval stage\r\nof aquatic or parasitic insects, as in the Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ),\r\nPerlidæ, Odonata, and Trichoptera, besides single genera of other\r\norders, _i.e._ among Coleoptera, Gyrinus, Pelobius, Cnemidotus, and the\r\nyoung larva of Elmis; in the aquatic caterpillar of Paraponyx; in\r\ncertain Diptera (Corethra, Chironomus, etc.), and some of the parasitic\r\nHymenoptera (Microgaster).\r\n\r\nPalmén has discovered that in the nymphs of Ephemeridæ, Perlidæ,\r\nOdonata, and the larvæ of most Trichoptera the tracheal branch\r\n(stigmatal branch) sent from the longitudinal trachea to where the\r\nthoracic stigmata would be situated if present, or where their vestiges\r\nonly exist, are aborted, becoming simple solid cords not filled with air\r\n(Fig. 436, _vf_, and 447, _f_, funiculus or stigmatic cord). In the\r\nimago, however, they resume their function, connecting with the open\r\nfunctional stigmata. In Corethra, in its earliest stages, the entire\r\ntracheal system is, like the stigmatic branch, a system of solid cords\r\nand empty of air. (Palmén.)\r\n\r\n  Embryology shows that these stigmatal branches are well developed,\r\n  and are formed at the same time as the stigmata. It was also shown\r\n  by Dewitz, in a posthumous paper (1890), that in the young larval\r\n  stage of the Odonata and Ephemeridæ the tracheal system is at first\r\n  an open one, and in some of the families (Libellulidæ, Agrionidæ,\r\n  and Ephemeridæ) thoracic stigmata are seen at a very early stage.\r\n  From numerous experiments Dewitz concludes that in the young stages\r\n  of Odonata and Ephemeridæ there is an open tracheal system;\r\n  certainly in very young nymphs the thoracic spiracles allow the air\r\n  to pass out. Fully grown nymphs of Æschnidæ, Libellulidæ, and\r\n  Agrionidæ are capable not only of forcing the air out, but also,\r\n  like the perfect insect, of inhaling it. Moreover, he proved that\r\n  the gills of Ephemeridæ and Agrionidæ are not indispensable for the\r\n  maintenance of life, as the insects can live without them, breathing\r\n  either through the skin or by the rectum, or in both ways. It would\r\n  seem that while in freshly hatched or very young larvæ of aquatic\r\n  insects of different orders the skin is so delicate as to allow of\r\n  dermal respiration, in after life, when the skin becomes thicker and\r\n  denser, these expansions (gills), provided with a very thin and\r\n  delicate skin, of a necessity grow out from the walls of the body.\r\n\r\n  It thus appears that the closure and total or partial abolition of\r\n  the stigmata are in adaptation to aquatic life, and that such\r\n  insects have descended from terrestrial air-breathing winged forms.\r\n  This is an important argument against the view that the wings are\r\n  modified tracheal gills.\r\n\r\n  In this connection may be noticed the closure of the 2d and 3d\r\n  thoracic stigmata in holopneustic insects. We have found on laying\r\n  open the body of a Sphinx larva that a large number of tracheal\r\n  branches are seen to arise from the prothoracic and from the first\r\n  pair of abdominal stigmata. Now between these points there are no\r\n  spiracles or any external signs of them, there being in Lepidoptera\r\n  no mesothoracic or metathoracic spiracles. Yet the main lateral\r\n  trachea between the prothoracic and first abdominal segments\r\n  deviates from its course and bends down to send off a small\r\n  shrivelled stigmatal branch or cord to a place where, did a spiracle\r\n  exist, we should look for it. In the larva of _Platysamia cecropia_,\r\n  a similar vestigial stigmata branch is present.\r\n\r\n  In the larva of Corydalus, also, a trachea as large as the main\r\n  longitudinal one takes its origin and passes directly under the main\r\n  trachea. Now both tracheæ send a stigmatal branch opposite to where\r\n  the mesothoracic stigma should be, if present, _i.e._ on the hind\r\n  edge of the segment.\r\n\r\n  Verson, moreover, has found in the freshly hatched silkworm vestiges\r\n  of meso- and metathoracic stigmata, each consisting of a circle of\r\n  high hypodermal cells radially arranged around a common centre. The\r\n  stigmatal branch is long, but shrivelled; its peritoneum is widened\r\n  out into several berry-like saccules filled with cell-elements. In\r\n  profile these rudimentary stigmata appear as a series of high\r\n  hypodermal cells, which form the basis of a short blind tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Lydia M. Hart _del._\r\n\r\n  PLATE I.—Examples of metapneustic insects: 1, _Bittacomorpha\r\n    clavipes_, larva; 1 _a_, false foot; 1 _b_, its pupa; 2,\r\n    _Limnophila luteipennis_; 2 _a_, end of larva; 2 _b_, its pupa; 3,\r\n    end of larva of _Tipula eluta_.—After C. A. Hart.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  After the second moult there begins a peculiar transformation of the\r\n  rudimentary stigmata. The stigmatal branch connected with them sends\r\n  off at various points thick tufts of capillary tracheæ which press\r\n  against the base of the blind tube. Gradually lengthening, they form\r\n  a fold which continues to increase in length. The numerous tufts of\r\n  tracheal capillaries extend beyond the inner surface of the two\r\n  layers of which the developing wing consists, the berry-like\r\n  saccules are drawn into the wing and converted into more or less\r\n  thick tubes, which finally form the “veins.” It is clear, therefore,\r\n  says Verson, as Landois claimed, that the wings of Lepidoptera must\r\n  be regarded as in the fullest sense organs of respiration. (Zool.\r\n  Anz., 1890, p. 116.)\r\n\r\nThe number of pairs of stigmata varies, especially in maggots or larval\r\nDiptera, in adaptation to their varied modes of life. The larvæ of most\r\nflies (Muscidæ) have a pair of peculiarly shaped processes on the\r\nprothoracic segment bearing spiracular openings, and two anal spiracles,\r\nwhile in _Ctenophora atrata_ L. only the anal pair are present. In the\r\nrat-tailed maggots (Eristalis) the long caudal process ends in two\r\nstigmata forming a respiratory tube, which can be thrust out of the\r\nwater for the reception of air. In the larval mosquito (Fig. 433) and\r\nits ally, Mochlonyx, a short thick dorsal tube arises from the\r\npenultimate segment of the body, in which the two main tracheæ end,\r\nopening outward by a single spiracular aperture. Other dipterous larvæ\r\n(Simulium, Tanypus, and Ceratopogon) possess no spiracles, the tracheal\r\nsystem being a closed one.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of most water beetles (Dyticidæ, Hydrophilidæ) possess but two\r\nspiracles, which, as in maggots, are situated at the end of the body.\r\nThe aquatic larva of Amphizoa, according to Hubbard, breathes much as in\r\nthe Dyticidæ, by means of two large valvular spiracles placed close\r\ntogether at the end of the body; “closed or rudimentary stigmata also\r\noccur on the mesothorax and on abdominal segments one to seven\r\ninclusive.”\r\n\r\n  Hubbard adds: “The larva of Pelobius is wholly aquatic and breathes\r\n  by branchiæ, but the obsolete stigmata are indicated precisely as in\r\n  Amphizoa, with the exception of the last pair, which in Amphizoa are\r\n  open spiracles, but in Pelobius are suppressed; the terminal eight\r\n  segments being prolonged in a swimming stylet.”\r\n\r\nFrom a review of the distribution of spiracles, and their atrophy,\r\npartial or total, it will be seen that there are intermediate stages\r\nbetween the open (holopneustic) and closed (apneustic) systems. These,\r\nfollowing Schiner, Brauer, and Palmén, may be defined thus:\r\n\r\n  1. _Metapneustic type._—The larvæ possess only a single pair of open\r\n  stigmata situated at the end of the body. (The dipterous Eristalis,\r\n  Tipula, Culex, Ptychoptera, Bittacomorpha (Plate I.) with certain\r\n  Tachinidæ, and in Coleoptera, the larvæ of Dyticus, and allies of\r\n  Hydrophilus and Cyphon.)\r\n\r\n  2. _Propneustic type._—The pupæ of Corethra, Culex, etc., in which\r\n  only the most anterior pair of spiracles are open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 428.—Visceral tracheal system of the nymph of _Æschna\r\n    maculatissima_: _o_, œsophagus; _E_, stomach; _M_, urinary tubes;\r\n    _R_, rectum; _A_, anus; _tv_, visceral tracheal trunks; _td_,\r\n    dorsal trunks.—After Oustalet.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  3. _Amphipneustic type._—Larvæ with a pair of open spiracles\r\n  situated at each end of the body, the intermediate spiracles being\r\n  closed.

The most complete and best\r\nillustrated modern account is that of Oustalet. In these insects the\r\nlarge rectum is lined with six double longitudinal ridges, in Æschna\r\nbearing numerous delicate tubes or papillæ, each of which contains very\r\nnumerous (by estimate 24,000) tracheal branches (Fig. 431); while in\r\nLibellula the gills are lamellate (Fig. 432). The tracheæ arise both\r\nfrom the main dorsal and visceral longitudinal trunks, which give rise\r\nto secondary branches passing into the walls of the rectum and sending\r\ninto the branchial papillæ fine twigs, which, extending to the distal\r\nend of the papilla or lamella, recurve and anastomose with the efferent\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 431.—A small part of one leaflet, highly magnified, showing many\r\n    fine tracheal branches.

When open, the water\r\npasses into the rectum and bathes the rectal gills, where it may be\r\nforcibly expelled as if shot out from a syringe, thus propelling the\r\ninsect forward. In Libellula the anus affords direct access to the\r\nintestinal cavity, but in Æschna Oustalet describes “a sort of vestibule\r\nseparated from the rectum by a circular valvule.” He also states that\r\nthe inspiration and the repulsion of water is produced at irregular\r\nintervals, and rather by the movements of the dorsal and sternal arches\r\nof the abdomen than by the contractions of the rectum, since the walls\r\nof this organ are less muscular than is supposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 433.—Larva of a mosquito (_Culex nemorosus_) of middle age, seen\r\n    from above, the tracheal system omitted: _at_, antennæ; _ab_, their\r\n    middle joint; _eg_, elastic articular membrane; _atm_, antennal\r\n    muscle; _atn_, antennal nerve; _zau_, compound; _eau_, simple eye;\r\n    _os_, brain; _oex_, extensor; _ofl_, flexor of labrum; _ha_, neck;\r\n    _œ_, œsophagus; _spd_, salivary gland; _mau_, cœca; _ch_, chyle\r\n    stomach; _di_, contents of intestine; _mg_, urinary tubes; _dd_,\r\n    ileum; _ed_, rectum; _a_, anus; _s_, sipho; _z″_, its bristles;\r\n    _kb_, tracheal gills: _k_{1}_, _k_{2}_, _k_{3}_, closing lobes of\r\n    the sipho; _kn_, basal tubercle of tactile hair; _g_, its ganglion\r\n    cell; _th_, tactile hair of the siphon valve.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The nymph of Calopteryx (and probably of all the group\r\n  Calopteryginæ) possesses rectal gills besides external caudal\r\n  tracheal gills. There are three double rectal longitudinal folds or\r\n  ridges, interpenetrated by tracheal twigs. (Dufour, denied by\r\n  Poletaiew, but confirmed by Hagen.)\r\n\r\n  Dewitz claims that the caudal gills of the Agrionidæ are not their\r\n  sole means of respiration, since he cut off the caudal tracheal\r\n  gills of an Agrionid nymph, which continued to live for a week.\r\n  Hence he thinks that there may be a rectal respiration, since under\r\n  the microscope he saw a stream of water pass in and out of the end\r\n  of the intestine.\r\n\r\n  Dewitz’ experiments prove that in young Ephemerids there may be\r\n  besides branchial, both rectal and skin respiration. He saw under\r\n  the microscope the anus for a while opened and then closed, causing\r\n  the rectum to move; powdered carmine mixed with water was drawn into\r\n  and then expelled from the rectum. There was, however, no\r\n  enlargement and contraction of the abdomen as in the rectal\r\n  respiration of Æschna. (Zool. Anz. 1890, p. 500.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 434.—End of the body of the same larva as in Fig. 431, seen from\r\n    the side, the branches of the main tracheæ (_htr_) omitted: _kbl_,\r\n    excrementitial pellet in rectum; _kb_, tracheal gills; _b_, funnel\r\n    of the closing apparatus; _hz_, hollow tooth of the closing\r\n    apparatus; _k_{1}_, _k_{2}_, _k_{3}_, siphonal lobes; _th_, tactile\r\n    hair; _as_, chitinous plate; _str_, rudder; _l_, its thickened edge;\r\n    _sch_, its shank; _z′_, _z″_, bristles.—This and Fig. 433, after\r\n    Raschke.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEaton states that there is a rectal respiration in the nymphs of\r\nmay-flies, and Palmén observed in young larvæ of Bætis and Cloëon that\r\nthe rectum took in “by gulps” water colored by carmine and expelled the\r\nwhole of it at once, in order to fill it again in the same way. “This\r\nrectal respiration therefore corresponds to that of Libellulid larvæ.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 435.—Thorax and anterior abdominal segments of the nymph of a\r\n    may-fly (_Cloëon dimidiatum_) with tracheal gills (_tk_{1}_,\r\n    _tk_{2}_, _tk_{3}_) and the rudiments of the fore wings (_VF_) and\r\n    hind wing (_HF_): _tl_, tracheal longitudinal trunks.—After Graber,\r\n    from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 436.—Gills on the middle abdominal segments of larva of _Bætis\r\n    binoculatus_: _trl_, longitudinal tracheal trunks; _vf_, stigmatic\r\n    cord; _ktr_, gill-tracheæ; _trk_, tracheal gills.—After Palmén, from\r\n    Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides breathing by spiracles, by tracheal gills, as well as through\r\nthe integument, the larva of Culex has been observed by Raschke to have\r\na rectal respiration. At the anterior end of the rectum arises a\r\ncountless number of fine tracheæ, which pass through the walls and,\r\nsubdividing, end in numberless very fine twigs in the papilla-like folds\r\nsituated within the rectum. The supply of tracheal twigs is greatest\r\nwhere the papillæ are largest. (Figs. 433, 434.)\r\n\r\n\r\n              _j._ Tracheal gills of the larvæ of insects\r\n\r\nIn many aquatic insects respiration is carried on by tracheal gills.\r\nThese are delicate, hollow, leaf-like or tubular outgrowths of the\r\nintegument usually attached to the sides or end of the hind-body, and\r\ncontaining a trachea which usually sends off numerous minute branches,\r\nso that the exchange of gases readily takes place in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 437.—A, nymph of _Ephemerella ignita_, with gills of left side\r\n    removed; _g_, gills. _B_, nymph of Tricorythrus (_sp_), with\r\n    gill-cover of right side removed; _gc_, gill-cover; _g_, _g′_,\r\n    gills.—After Vayssière.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 438.—Left maxilla of _Jolia weselii_, with the cephalic tracheal\r\n    gill (_h_) inserted at the base on the under side.—After Vayssière.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPalmén has shown that these tracheal gills, as he calls them, are not\r\ndeveloped on the same segments as the stigmata, and that the two\r\nstructures have no genetic connection with each other. It is evident\r\nthat these gills are secondary, adaptive organs.\r\n\r\nIn some cases (see p. 475) the tracheæ are wanting, but as such gills\r\nare filled with blood, the air contained in the water must pass in\r\nthrough their delicate walls.\r\n\r\nIn the Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ) the tracheal gills are either foliaceous\r\nor filamentous; when foliaceous they form simple or double leaves, with\r\nor without branches, or with a fringe of tubules, or under the leaf-like\r\ncover-bearing tufts of filaments. They are situated on the (usually)\r\nbasal seven abdominal segments, at their hinder edge (Figs. 435, 436).\r\nIn Oligoneuria and Jolia a pair occurs on the under side of the head,\r\nattached to the maxillæ, while in Jolia there is a pair on the under\r\nside of the first thoracic segment at the insertion of each of the legs.\r\nIn certain genera (Heptagenia, Oligoneuria, and Jolia), they are in the\r\nform of a flat cover, under which lies a tuft of respiratory tubes, or\r\n(Ephemerella) a small bifid cluster of very delicate leaves (Fig. 437,\r\n_A_). In Cœnis and Tricorythus the tracheal gills of the second pair are\r\nmodified to form plates covering all the succeeding pairs, those of the\r\nfirst pair being nearly atrophied and well-nigh functionless. (Fig. 437,\r\n_B_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 439.—Inner side of a gill-cover of the first pair, of\r\n    Ephemerella, with the tracheal gills.—After Vayssière.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 440.—Nymph of Bætisca: III, section of abdomen; _a_, gills; _b_,\r\n    flap; 1–9, abdominal segments.—After Walsh.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 441.—Nymph of _Prosopistoma punctifrons_: _o_, upper orifice of\r\n    the respiratory chamber.—After Vayssière.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 442.—Filamentous tracheal gill and part of a trachea of\r\n    Pteronarcys.—After Newport from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the highly modified forms Bætisca and Prosopistoma the\r\ntracheal gills are entirely concealed and protected by mesothoracic\r\nprojections so as to form a true respiratory chamber, to which the water\r\nhas access either by an opening behind, as in Bætisca, or by three\r\nopenings, two ventral and one dorsal (Fig. 441), as in Prosopistoma.\r\n\r\nThe slender cylindrical tracheal gills of Heptagenia in the third or\r\nfourth nymphal stage are 2–jointed, and the first abdominal pair in\r\nCænis are said by Palmén to be finger-shaped and 2–jointed. In\r\n_Polymitarcys virgo_ the gills do not appear until the eighth or tenth\r\nday after hatching.\r\n\r\n  Dewitz found that young nymphs of Ephemerids will well endure the\r\n  amputation of their gills, while fully grown ones die. Amputation of\r\n  the lateral gills hastens ecdysis. After the change of skin, the\r\n  gills are smaller than before, and at first contain no tracheæ, but\r\n  in a few weeks they develop as completely as in normal individuals.\r\n  The caudal gills were also renewed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 443.—_A_, larva of Sisyra, enlarged. _B_, one of the hinder\r\n    gills, with its tracheæ.—After Westwood, from Sharp. _C_, a gill,\r\n    showing the branched tracheæ.—After Grube.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the nymphs of Perlidæ the tracheal gills are usually present, and are\r\neither foliaceous (Nemoura) or more commonly filamentous in shape (Fig.\r\n442). They are situated either on the prosternum (Nemoura and\r\nPteronarcys), or on each side of the thorax, or on the sides of the\r\nabdomen, or are restricted to a tuft on each side of the anus at the\r\nbase of the caudal stylets (Pteronarcys and Perla). Unlike the\r\nEphemeridæ the gills persist in certain genera throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the aquatic Neuroptera, Sisyra, Sialis, and Corydalus\r\npossess lateral pointed bristle-like tracheal gills, which in Sisyra are\r\n2–jointed; those of Sialis are, in the living larva, curved upwards and\r\nbackwards (Fig. 444). Corydalus is also provided with a ventral tuft of\r\ndelicate filamentous gills, which, however, according to Riley, do not\r\nappear until after the first moult.\r\n\r\nWhile the nymphs of Agrionidæ (which have rectal gills) respire chiefly\r\nby the large caudal foliaceous gills (Fig. 445), there are, according to\r\nHagen, two genera of the Calopteryginæ (Euphæa, Fig. 445, and\r\nAnisopleura) whose nymphs possess seven pairs of external lateral\r\ntracheal gills, in shape like those of Sialis, besides three caudal and\r\nthree rectal tracheal gills.[74]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 444.—Larva of _Sialis lutarius_.—After Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 445.—Caudal tracheal gill of nymph of Agrion.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Hagen has also detected in the under side of the 5th abdominal\r\n  segment of Epitheca and Libellula a pair of sacs of the shape of a\r\n  Phrygian bonnet, each of which contains a smaller sac lined with\r\n  epithelium,—as in Æschna they occur in the 5th and 6th, and in\r\n  Gomphus in the 4th, 5th, and 6th segments. This serial arrangement\r\n  appears to confirm Hagen’s suggestion that they are survivals of\r\n  abdominal gills, which in Euphæa are completely evaginated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 446.—Nymph of Euphæa, showing the lateral gills: _a_, one\r\n    enlarged.—Folsom _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Trichoptera, all of which, except Enoicyla, are apneustic, and\r\nmost of which have tracheal gills, the latter are filamentous, and arise\r\neither from the dorsal and ventral sides of the abdominal segment, or\r\nthey grow out from the sides; while in certain genera (Neuronia,\r\nPhryganea, etc.) the gills are represented by conical hooks on the sides\r\nof the 1st abdominal segment, which are evidently respiratory, as they\r\ncontain numerous tracheæ. The tracheal gills are either single or more\r\nrarely form tufts (Figs. 447, 448).\r\n\r\nIn Hydropsyche (Fig. 448) the tracheal gills persist throughout life,\r\nwhile in other genera they only last through the pupal stage. When first\r\nhatched, the larva of Phryganea lacks gills. The larvæ of most of the\r\nHydropsychidæ, Rhyacophilidæ, and Hydroptilidæ have no gills, though\r\nthey appear well developed in the pupal stage.

Its thread-like gills, arranged in\r\ntufts of three or four, arise from a common tubercle situated on the\r\nsides of nearly all the segments. Wood-Mason describes the East Indian\r\n_P. oryzalis_ as “covered with a perfect forest of soft and delicate\r\nwhite filaments,” arranged in tufts disposed in four longitudinal rows.\r\n“The stigmata of the 2d, 3d, and 4th abdominal somites only are clearly\r\ndiscernible.” The caterpillar crawls “free and uncovered” over the\r\nsubmerged leaves of the rice plant “in the very midst of the water.” In\r\na Brazilian species of Paraponyx described as _Cataclysta pyropalis_, by\r\nW. Müller, the tufts are reduced to simple unbranched filaments, and the\r\ncase is more complex than in the European species (Fig. 449).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 450.—Anterior end of larva of _P. stratiolata_, showing the head\r\n    and first two thoracic segments, with their gills: _A_, a tuft of\r\n    gills, much enlarged.—After De Geer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 451.—Larva (1) and pupa (2_a_) of _Paraponyx pyropalis_ enlarged:\r\n    _st_, stigmata.—After W. Müller.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf coleopterous larvæ breathing by tracheal gills there are but few. The\r\nlarva of Gyrinus (Fig. 454) respires by 10 pairs of slender, hairy\r\nabdominal gills similar to those of Corydalus, and the stigmata are\r\nentirely wanting. Somewhat similar are the tracheal gills of\r\n_Hydrocharis caraboides_. Hydrobius has shorter setose gills, our\r\nAmerican species having seven pairs of short setose gills. It has two\r\nspiracles at the end of the body, through which the air is taken by\r\nthrusting the body out of the water. The larvæ of two other aquatic\r\ncoleopterous genera, Pelobius and Cnemidotus, also have gills; those of\r\nthe former situated at the base of the coxæ, and brush-like, but\r\ncontaining no tracheæ, though filled with blood, while those of\r\nCnemidotus are very long, bristle-like, jointed, and arising from the\r\ndorsal side of the thoracic and abdominal segments. The stigmata are\r\nwanting. (Schiödte.)\r\n\r\nThe larva of the dipterous genus Tanypus respires by two caudal\r\npapilliform processes, in each of which a trachea ramifies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 452.—Freshly hatched larva of Hydrobius: _t_, enlarged tracheæ,\r\n    the heart between them; _g^1_-_g^7_, the seven pairs of gills. _A_,\r\n    end of body, enlarged, showing the two terminal stigmata.—Emerton\r\n    _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nCertain larvæ with both stigmata and tracheal gills are enabled either\r\nto live in or out of water or on the surface, as in the case of certain\r\nbeetles (Cyphonidæ, Elmidæ, Hydrophilidæ, Fig. 452), or the larval\r\nmosquito and Psychodes (Fig. 455); also the nymphs of dragon-flies.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the Cyphonidæ (Helodes, Cyphon, Hydrocyphon) possess but a\r\nsingle pair of stigmata, situated in the penultimate abdominal segment,\r\nwhile at the end of the abdomen are delicate tracheal gills. The two\r\nmain tracheal trunks are much swollen. When on the surface of the water\r\nthe larva breathes through the stigmata situated near the end of the\r\nabdomen; when floating in the water, the larva, like that of Gyrinus,\r\ncarries along at the end of its body a bubble of air. The gills are only\r\nof use, as Rolph thinks, when the insect is compelled to remain a long\r\ntime under water.\r\n\r\nThe larva of our native _Prionocyphon discoideus_ (Say) is described by\r\nWalsh as “vibrating vigorously up and down a pencil of hairs proceeding\r\nfrom a horizontal slit in the tail”; this pencil is composed “of three\r\npairs of filaments, each beautifully bipectinate. I presume it is used\r\nto extract air from the water.” When the larva is at the surface the\r\npencil of hairs touches the surface of the water, and occasionally a\r\nbubble of air is discharged from the tail. “The general habit is to\r\ncrawl on decayed wood beneath the surface, occasionally swimming to the\r\nsurface, probably for a fresh supply of air.” (Proc. Ent. Soc. Phil., i,\r\np. 117.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 453.—Larva of Psephenus, enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 454.—Larva of Gyrinus.—After Westwood.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the small water beetles of the family Elmidæ (Elmis,\r\nPotamophilus, Macronychus, and Psephenus) have similar habits. That of\r\nElmis has ten dorsally situated pairs of spiracles, and on the end of\r\nthe body bushy gills which are protruded at pleasure. The young larva is\r\nwithout spiracles, its tracheal system being closed. Macronychus and\r\nPotamophilus have similar habits. In the larva of the latter genus,\r\nwhich has nine pairs of spiracles, there are at the end of the body on\r\neach side three tufts of thread-like gills which are connected with the\r\ntwo main horizontal tracheæ, while the branches of the abdominal tracheæ\r\nare dilated into numerous (64) bladder-like sacs. The larva usually\r\nbreathes through the caudal gills. When the water is low or dried up,\r\nthe air is inhaled directly through the spiracles. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Psephenus lecontei_, by its broad hemispherical body, is\r\nadapted to adhere to the smooth surface of rounded stones, in which\r\nsituation we have found it. Although it is said by Rolph to have two\r\npairs of spiracles, one pair on the mesothoracic and the other on the\r\n1st abdominal segment, it probably rarely rises to the surface to\r\nbreathe the air direct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 455.—End of body of a Psychodes larva: _A_, end of body of a\r\n    young, freshly moulted larva, side view: _a_, the three anal gills;\r\n    _b_, the left air-cavity. _B_, older larva of the same species, with\r\n    the open air-cavity seen from above. _C_, end of larva of another\r\n    species as it goes down into the water with a bubble of air, _b_,\r\n    between the crown of hairs of the air-cavity or tube: _a_, the two\r\n    pairs of anal gills; _b_, the two main tracheæ.—After F. Müller.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt possesses five pairs of gills on the under side of the 2d to the 6th\r\nabdominal segments. Each gill has finger-shaped processes on its hinder\r\nedge, which are “from their constant motion evidently connected with\r\nrespiration.” Tracheæ may be seen, according to H. J. Clark, entering\r\nthe gills, and “the circulation of water among the branchiæ is kept up\r\nby the flapping of the tail-pieces.” The larva of _Helichus fastigiatus_\r\nis said by Leconte to be “very nearly allied, while the remotely allied\r\n_Stenelmis crenatus_ has no external branchiæ.”[75]\r\n\r\n  The larva of the mosquito also has two modes of respiration,\r\n  breathing either at the surface of the water through the two\r\n  spiracles situated on the projection (siphon) at the hinder end of\r\n  the body which is thrust out into the air; or when at the bottom\r\n  respiring by tracheal gills. The pupa also has a double mode of\r\n  respiration, either taking in air at the surface by the two thoracic\r\n  horns with stigmatic openings, or when submerged using its tracheal\r\n  gills.\r\n\r\n  Besides its long caudal tracheal air-tubes, the larval Eristalis is\r\n  said by Chun to thrust out from the anus a number (20) of short\r\n  tracheal filaments which float about in the water and serve to\r\n  absorb the air.\r\n\r\nAn aquatic Brazilian larva of the family Psychodidæ has been found by\r\nFritz Müller to take down under the water a large bubble of air (Fig.\r\n455, _C_), the main tracheal trunk ending each in an opening at the end\r\nof the body (_A_, _B_); besides this, while at the bottom it breathes by\r\nthree digitiform tracheal gills; another species having two pairs (_C_,\r\n_a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 456.—Under side of body of larva of Blepharocera. showing the\r\n    position of the tracheal gills: _A_, section of the body through a\r\n    sucker, showing position of the gills. _B_, section of a sucker:\r\n    _br_, gill with numerous tracheæ; _gl_, outlet of excretory gland;\r\n    _M_, _m_, muscles.—After F. Müller.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable larvæ of the Blepharoceridæ (represented in the United\r\nStates by _Blepharocera capitata_), which live permanently in swift\r\nstreams, attached by median suckers to stones, are apneustic, and\r\nbreathe solely by leaf-like tracheal gills (Fig. 456, _br_) attached to\r\nthe under side of the second to sixth abdominal segments. Those of the\r\nEuropean Liponeura are said by Wierzejski to be branched, tree-like.\r\nAlso immediately in front of the anus and behind the last sucker are\r\nfour membranous sacs provided with tracheæ, but which are not capable of\r\nbeing withdrawn. These are said by Müller to be the same as what Dewitz\r\nstates to serve as gills, and by Wierzejski they are homologized with\r\nthe four anal gills of Chironomus.\r\n\r\n  The double mode of respiration in the larva of the horse bot-fly has\r\n  been described by Scheiber. On the hinder end of the body are the\r\n  stigmatic plates, which contain two lateral gill-plates and the\r\n  middle stigmatal leaf. Besides this there is a pair of slightly\r\n  developed prothoracic spiracles. The embryo and also freshly hatched\r\n  larva of _Gastrophilus equi_ do not possess these gill-plates, but\r\n  on the end of the body are, according to Joli, two long thread-like\r\n  gills. The freshly hatched larva of the allied _Cephenomyia\r\n  rufibarbis_ bears two caudal projections. (Kolbe.) As in shrimps and\r\n  other Crustacea the gills are kept in constant motion, the water\r\n  being driven over them by the rapid movements of the telson, so in\r\n  the larval may-flies, and in the case-worm (Macronema), the gills\r\n  move more or less rapidly. In case-worms as well as larval Perlidæ,\r\n  Sialidæ, Paraponyx, and Hydrophilidæ the abdominal region is\r\n  constantly moved to promote respiration. (Kolbe.)\r\n\r\n=Blood-gills.=—Fritz Müller describes in trichopterous larvæ certain\r\ndelicate anal tubular processes into which the blood flows, and which do\r\nnot as a rule contain tracheæ, though occasionally very fine tracheal\r\nbranches. Müller compares them with the gills of crabs and of shrimps.\r\nThey are eversible finger-like tubules. They are used when the tracheal\r\ngills are temporarily not available. Their number varies even in the\r\nsame genus. There are six in certain Rhyacophilidæ; five in different\r\nHydropsychidæ; in Macronema there are four, and they are green when\r\nfilled with the green blood of that insect, the tracheal gills being\r\nwhitish. In the freshly hatched larva, while the tracheal gills are\r\npresent, no anal blood-gills are visible. Similar blood-gills also occur\r\nin the pupæ of certain caddis-flies. (Pictet.)\r\n\r\nSimilar anal gills filled with blood occur in the larvæ of the fireflies\r\n(Lampyris, etc.), and perhaps, Kolbe thinks, serve for respiration,\r\nthough other authors believe them to be adhesive organs.\r\n\r\nThe larva of Pelobius has true blood-gills. (Schiödte. See p. 461.)\r\n\r\n  The eversible ventral segmental sacs of Scolopendrella, Campodea,\r\n  and Machilis, as well as the ventral tube (collophore) of Podura,\r\n  Smynthurus, etc., may, as Oudemans and Haase have suggested, serve a\r\n  respiratory purpose, though they lack tracheæ, and differ from\r\n  blood-gills in containing no gases; yet the blood is forced into\r\n  them, causing their eversion. Oudemans observed that Machilis\r\n  everted its sacs when the vessel in which it was put was filled with\r\n  warm, damp air. The sacs are only thrust out when the creature is\r\n  completely at rest.\r\n\r\nStructures referable to blood-gills also occur temporarily in the embryo\r\nof Orthoptera; Rathke observed them in the mole-cricket; Ayres observed\r\nthem in _Œcanthus niveus_, where they form two stalked broad oval\r\nappendages on the first abdominal appendages, which he regarded as\r\ngills. Patten observed them in _Phyllodromia germanica_, as pear-shaped\r\nstructures occurring in the same situation, but regarded them as\r\nsense-organs, as did Cholodkowsky. Graber found these structures in the\r\nembryo of the May-beetle, which looked like the other embryonic limbs,\r\nbut survived after the disappearance of the latter, being longer and\r\nbroader and unjointed. These disappeared shortly before birth. In\r\nHydrophilus they remain, Graber states, after birth. Nussbaum has seen\r\nthem in Meloë.\r\n\r\nFinally, Wheeler has discussed at length these embryonic organs, which\r\nhe regards as glandular structures, and calls _pleuropodia_, their\r\nprimitive function having been that of limbs. He has detected them in\r\nthe embryo of _Periplaneta orientalis_, _Mantis carolina_, _Xiphidium\r\nensiferum_ (Fig. 387); also in the Hemiptera (_Cicada septemdecim_,\r\n_Zaitha fluminea_), and in _Sialis infumata_. He discards the view that\r\nthey were once gills or sense-organs, and concludes that they were\r\nglands. But, as we have suggested, their function once that of gills,\r\nand still respiratory in Synaptera, has perhaps become in the winged\r\ninsects glandular and repugnatorial. Instead, then, of being modified\r\nabdominal limbs afterwards serving as glands, as Wheeler claims, we are\r\ninclined to believe that they functioned as blood-gills.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _k._ Tracheal gills of adult insects\r\n\r\nTracheal gills are known to be retained by a few insects in the imago\r\nstage, the nymphs in all stages breathing by them. The most notable\r\nexample is the perlid genus Pteronarcys, in which, as Newport states,\r\nthere are eight sets, comprising 13 pairs of branchial tufts distributed\r\nover the under surface of the thoracic and first two abdominal segments.\r\n\r\n  The first set, consisting of three pairs of tufts, partly encircling\r\n  the neck like a ruff, arises from the soft membrane connecting the\r\n  head and prosternum. The thoracic tufts originate between and behind\r\n  the coxæ, as well as on the front margin of the meso- and\r\n  metathoracic segments. The number of filaments in each tuft varies\r\n  from about 20 to 50 or more, the densest tufts being those of the\r\n  two hinder thoracic segments. Each filament is usually simple,\r\n  though in a few cases they are branched (Fig. 457, _A_).\r\n\r\n  The adult Pteronarcys is nocturnal, flying only at dewfall or in the\r\n  night, and Mr. Barnston observed it when on the wing, “constantly\r\n  dipping on the surface of the water”; by day it hides “in crevices\r\n  of rocks which are constantly wetted by the spray of falling water,\r\n  under stones and in other damp places.” It may thus be compared with\r\n  the Amphibians, Necturus and Proteus, whose gills are retained in\r\n  adult life. A similar large Chilian Perlid (_Diamphipnoa lichenalis_\r\n  Gerst.) differs in completely lacking the thoracic gills, though\r\n  there are four pairs on the abdomen, _i.e._ a pair on each of the\r\n  first four segments. In this form the number of individual filaments\r\n  in the largest tufts may amount to about 200.\r\n\r\n  Another Perlid (_Dictyopteryx signata_) is said by Hagen to have two\r\n  pairs of gill-tufts on the under side of the head; the first pair\r\n  situated on the base of the submentum, the second on the membrane\r\n  connecting the head and prosternum.\r\n\r\n  Kolbe states that in the imagines of _Perla marginata_ and _P.\r\n  cephalotes_ on the hinder edge of the thoracic stigmata arise three\r\n  very small chitinous plates, which, on their under side and on the\r\n  edges are beset with numerous short white filaments. These\r\n  completely correspond to the filaments of the tuft-like larval\r\n  gills. Persistent anal gills also occur in the imagines of Perla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 457.—Under side of _Pteronarcys regalis_, showing the situation\r\n    of the gills _(g_, _b_, _f_) and the sternal orifices: _A_, a\r\n    branchial filament showing the direction of the current of blood;\r\n    _c_, _d_, tracheæ. _B_, end of the abdomen enlarged.—After\r\n    Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In _Nemoura lateralis_ and _cinerea_ the tracheal gills are\r\n  differently disposed. On each side of the anterior edge of the\r\n  prosternum arise delicate tightly twisted filaments, like those of\r\n  the larva. (Einführung, p. 536.)\r\n\r\n  Hagen also states that in the dragon-fly, Euphæa, the gills of the\r\n  nymphs are retained in the imago, and Palmén remarks that in Æschna\r\n  the rectal gills of the nymph persist in the imago, though not used\r\n  for respiration.\r\n\r\n  Palmén gives an instance of a caddis-fly (Hydropsyche, Fig. 448)\r\n  retaining its gills through the imago stage, but they are unfit for\r\n  respiration, as they are minute and shrunken.\r\n\r\n  A walking-stick (_Prisopus flabelliformis_) found in the mountains\r\n  of Brazil has the remarkable habit, according to Murray, of spending\r\n  “the whole of the day under water, in a stream or rivulet, fixed\r\n  firmly to a stone in the rapid part of the stream,” with its head\r\n  turned up stream; but leaving the water at dark. The under side of\r\n  the body, including the head, is hollowed so that the creature may\r\n  adhere, sucker-like, to smooth stones; the claws, claspers, and\r\n  flaps on the legs aid in retaining its hold, while the outer margin\r\n  of the legs is dentate and thickly fringed with hair to repel the\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  Another form, closely related to Prisopus, from Borneo (_Cotylosoma\r\n  dipneusticum_) is said by Wood-Mason to be even more profoundly\r\n  modified for an aquatic life, since it has not only spiracles, but\r\n  also, as he claims, tracheal gills. From each side of the body, in\r\n  fact along the lower margins of the sides of the metathorax, there\r\n  stand straight out five equal, small, but conspicuous ciliated oval\r\n  plates, “which, when the insect is submerged and its stigmata are\r\n  closed, doubtless serve for respiration.” The author did not note\r\n  the actual presence of tracheæ in these plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         LITERATURE ON THE ORGANS AND PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _a._ On the tracheal system in general\r\n\r\n  =Lyonet, P.= Traité anatomique de la chenille qui ronge le bois du\r\n    saule.

The reproductive organs are situated in the hind-body or\r\nabdomen, especially near the end, the genital glands opening externally\r\neither in the space between the 7th and 8th, or 8th and 9th, or 9th and\r\n10th abdominal segments, but as a rule between the 8th and 9th segments\r\n(Fig. 299).\r\n\r\nThe primary or essential male organs are the testes, those of the female\r\nbeing the ovaries. As we shall see, the primitive number of seminal\r\nducts and oviducts was two, this number being still retained in Lepisma\r\nand the Ephemeridæ. The reproductive organs of both sexes are at first,\r\nin their embryonic condition, of the same shape and structure, becoming\r\ndifferentiated in form and function before sexual maturity. These glands\r\nand ducts have a paired mesodermal genital rudiment, the ends of the\r\nducts being often connected with corresponding ectodermal invaginations\r\nof the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe secondary sexual organs mainly comprise the external genital\r\narmature of the male, and the egg-laying organs, or ovipositor of the\r\nfemale. Besides these structures there are other more superficial\r\nsecondary sexual characters, such as differences in the size and\r\nornamentation as well as coloring of the body, or of parts of it.\r\n\r\nThe primary sexual organs of insects have been conveniently tabulated by\r\nKolbe, thus:—\r\n\r\nI. _Male reproductive organs._\r\n\r\n             1. Two testes, with testicular follicles.\r\n             2. Seminal ducts (_vasa deferentia_).\r\n             3. Seminal vesicle.\r\n             4. Accessory glands.\r\n             5. The common seminal outlet, with the penis.\r\n             6. The copulatory apparatus.\r\n\r\nII. _Female reproductive organs._\r\n\r\n               1. Two ovaries, with the egg-tubes.\r\n               2. Two oviducts.\r\n               3. Receptaculum seminis; bursa copulatrix.\r\n               4. Accessory sac.\r\n               5. The common oviduct, vagina, uterus.\r\n               6. The ovipositor.\r\n\r\n  The ducts of the sexual glands in Peripatus being transformed\r\n  nephridia or segmental organs, it has been inferred that this is\r\n  also the case with those of insects, though, as Lang states, there\r\n  is a considerable difference in the two cases, as the greater part\r\n  of the ducts in Peripatus arises out of the ectoderm, while in the\r\n  Myriopoda and insects they come from the mesoderm; but he adds that\r\n  in the Annelids the greater part of the nephridial duct is of\r\n  mesodermal origin.\r\n\r\nWhile in insects there is but a single pair of genital outlets, the\r\nserial arrangement of the testicular (Fig. 458) and egg-tubes (Fig. 459)\r\nin some Thysanura (Campodea, Japyx, and Lepisma), where the tubes (5 to\r\n7 on each side) open singly one behind the other in segmental\r\nsuccession, indicates that in their ancestors these egg-tubes opened out\r\non different segments situated one behind the other. Each egg-tube\r\nindependently opens into one of the two oviducts, which extend through\r\nthe abdomen as straight canals. The two oviducts open externally by a\r\nshort unpaired terminal portion, which in Machilis is said to be\r\nwanting, only the outer aperture of the two oviducts being in this case\r\ncommon to both. In Campodea and in the Collembola the ovaries and testes\r\non each side are simply tubes. It is to be observed that in the young\r\nLepisma Nassonow found that the external openings of the two ejaculatory\r\nducts are paired (Fig. 458 _B_, _ed._).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 458.—Male genital organs of Thysanura: _A_, Lepisma in which the\r\n    testes are segmentally arranged.—After Grassi. _B_, _Lepisma\r\n    saccharina_, young ♂: _vd_, vas deferens; _ed_, ejaculatory duct;\r\n    _ga_, external appendages,—After Nassonow. _C_, Machilis, the testis\r\n    lateral and separate, but not corresponding to the segments. _D_,\r\n    Japyx, with an undivided testicular tube on each side; _tt_, testes;\r\n    _cd_, vas deferens; _vs_, seminal vesicle; _ce_, ejaculatory\r\n    duct.—After Grassi, from Perrier.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the Stylopidæ, also, though this may be the result of adaptation\r\n  to the singular parasitic habits of the females whose bodies are\r\n  mostly situated in the abdomen of their host, the ends of the\r\n  oviducts are formed by the invagination of the integument of the 2d,\r\n  3d, and 4th abdominal segments. In the 2d to 5th segments are\r\n  situated tubes which open in the cavity of the body with funnel-like\r\n  ends, so that the ducts have a close resemblance to the segmental\r\n  organs of worms. (Nassonow.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 459.—Ovaries of Thysanura: _A_, of Campodea. _B_, of Japyx.—After\r\n    Grassi. _C_, of Machilis.—After Oudemans, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 460.—Female genital organs of _Lepisma saccharina_, adult: _ov_,\r\n    ovaries; _a_, part of the oviduct, corresponding to the calyx of\r\n    winged insects; _od_, oviduct; _vg_, vagina; _rs_, copulatory pouch;\r\n    _gg_, accessory glands; _m_, muscles; _n_, nervous cord.—After\r\n    Nassonow, from Perrier.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the winged insects the reproductive organs of the cricket (Fig.\r\n466) are perhaps as simple as any. The testes are separate, and the vasa\r\ndeferentia very long. The seminal vesicles bear numerous large and short\r\nutricles (_utriculi majores_ and _breviores_), the penis being simple\r\nand dilated at the end; while in _Phyllodromia germanica_ the testes are\r\nfunctional throughout life, and consist of four lobes each. In the\r\ncommon cockroach (_P. orientalis_) (Fig. 461) the testes are functional\r\nonly in the young male; they afterwards shrivel and are functionally\r\nreplaced by the vesiculæ seminales and their appendages, when the later\r\ntransformations of the sperm-cells are effected. The accessory glands\r\nare numerous and differ both in function and insertion. Two sets of\r\nthese glands (utriculi majores and breviores) are attached to the\r\nvesiculæ seminales and the fore end of the ejaculatory duct, while\r\nanother appendage, called by Miall and Denny the _conglobate gland_,\r\nopens separately on the exterior upon a double hook, which forms a part\r\nof the external genital armature. The so-called penis is long, slender,\r\nand dilated at the end, but is not perforated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 461.—_A_, male organs of the cockroach, ventral view: _Ts_,\r\n    testis; _VD_, vas deferens; _DE_, ductus ejaculatorius; _U_,\r\n    utriculi majores; _u_, utriculi breviores; 2, dorsal view; 3, _CG_,\r\n    conglobate gland and its duct. _B_, male organs, side view: _A_,\r\n    titillator; _B_, penis; other letters as in _A_.—After Miall and\r\n    Denny.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the locusts (Acrydiidæ) the testes are, unlike those of most other\r\nOrthoptera, closely united to each other so as to form a single mass of\r\ntubular glands into which penetrate both simple and dilated tracheæ; the\r\nentire mass is situated in the 3d, 4th, and 5th abdominal segments, and\r\nabove the intestine. The anterior end of the testicular mass is rounded\r\nand held in place by a broad, thin band, one on each side; two similar\r\nbands are situated a little behind the middle of the mass. From the\r\nunder side, and a little in advance of the middle of the mass, two\r\nstraight small ducts, as long as the testicular mass, pass obliquely to\r\nthe sides of the body, at the posterior end of the 7th segment of the\r\nabdomen; these are the vasa deferentia. Each vas deferens, with its\r\nmate, forms a convoluted mass of tubes, comprising twenty folded bundles\r\n(_epididymis_ of Dufour), and two single, long, convoluted tubes, the\r\n_vesiculæ seminales_, which are lobed in the 6th and 7th segments of the\r\nabdomen. The two vesiculæ unite over the 5th abdominal ganglion, forming\r\na thick, very short canal (_ductus ejaculatorius_), which passes into a\r\nlarge spherical muscular mass (præputium), behind which is the large\r\nintromittent organ (_penis_), which forms a short chitinous cylinder,\r\nquite complicated in structure, being armed with hooks and projections\r\nand affording excellent specific characters. It can be seen in place\r\nwithout dissection by drawing back the orbicular convex piece called the\r\n_velum penis_.\r\n\r\nIn the Hymenoptera the reproductive system is quite simple, as seen in\r\nFig. 462.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 462.—Male organs of saw-fly (Athalia centifoliæ): _a_, _a_,\r\n    testes; _b_, _b_, epididymis; _c_, _d_, vas deferentia; _e_,\r\n    vesiculæ seminales; _f_, ductus ejaculatorius; _h_, penis (see also\r\n    p. 180).—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general shape and relations of the female reproductive organs are\r\nseen in Fig. 298, of the locust (Acrydiidæ). The ovaries consist of two\r\nlarge bundles of tubes, each bundle tied to the other by slight bands,\r\nwith air-sacs and tracheæ ramifying among them. These tubes extend along\r\nthe intestine, passing into the prothorax. The ovarian tubes opening\r\ninto the oviducts unite to form the vagina, which lies on the floor of\r\nthe abdomen. (In the cockroach the vagina has a muscular wall and\r\nchitinous lining.) Above the opening of the duct, and directly\r\ncommunicating with it, is the copulatory pouch (_bursa copulatrix_), a\r\ncapacious pocket lined within with several narrow, longitudinal,\r\nchitinous bands. Behind the bursa copulatrix lies, partly resting under\r\nthe fifth abdominal ganglion, the sebific, cement, or colleterial gland\r\n(_colleterium_; compare Fig. 299, _sb_), which is flattened,\r\npear-shaped, a little over half as long as a ripe egg of the same\r\ninsect. From the under side, a little in advance of the middle, arises\r\nthe sebific duct, which, after making three tight coils next to the\r\nganglion, passes back and empties into the upper side of the bursa\r\ncopulatrix, dilating slightly before its junction with the latter.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive type of reproductive organs observed in insects is\r\nthat of the young Lepisma and the Ephemeridæ, in which the outlets of\r\nthe oviducts and of the vasa deferentia respectively are double or\r\npaired, showing that insects have probably inherited these structures\r\nfrom the segmental organs of their vermian ancestors.\r\n\r\nRéaumur had already observed the process of oviposition and seen that\r\nthe female Ephemera had two openings near the end of the “6th” abdominal\r\nsegment, from which he saw two masses of eggs pass out at a time (Fig.\r\n463). Eaton afterwards (1871) referred to the oviducts as terminating\r\nbetween the 7th and 8th segments of the abdomen, and after him Joly; but\r\nfor a detailed monograph on the subject we are indebted to Palmén. He\r\nfound that the outlets of the sexual glands are paired, not only in the\r\nlarvæ of all stages, but also in the imagines, and in both sexes. In the\r\nmales the vasa deferentia pass on the ventral side of the 9th segment\r\nthrough two external appendages, both reproductive organs, at whose tips\r\nor sides the openings are situated. In the larvæ the female openings are\r\nnot formed until after the last moult. In the females the two oviducts\r\nopen on the ventral side of the hind-body between the 7th and 8th\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 463.—Upturned end of body of Ephemera, with two egg-masses (_o_)\r\n    issuing at the same time from the double oviducts; _q_, anus.—After\r\n    Réaumur.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPalmén suggests that the Ephemerids represent, in respect to the\r\nreproductive system among insects, a very primitive type of\r\norganization, and he concludes that the inner sexual organs of insects\r\nare built up of two different morphological elements; _i.e._ (_a_)\r\ninternal primitive paired structures (testes with vasa deferentia,\r\novaria with oviducts), and (_b_) integumental structures, such as the\r\nductus ejaculatorius and vagina.\r\n\r\nIn the younger larvæ the vasa deferentia form slender cords along which\r\nare situated the seminal glands; these cords are inserted in the\r\nintegument on the hinder edge of the 9th sternite, where afterwards,\r\nduring the last moult, the copulatory organs grow out. In the older\r\nlarvæ the sperm collects in the cavities of these cords. Their walls\r\nbecome expanded, and this section then functions as vesiculæ seminales.\r\nThe ends of the cords remain contracted and act as ductus ejaculatorii.\r\nCommon unpaired glandular structures are not present. At the last moult\r\nthe copulatory organs reach their complete development, and the ducts\r\nbecome open externally.\r\n\r\nThe oviducts in the larva are at first slender, string-like, and bear\r\nthe egg-follicles. As soon as the eggs pass out of the follicles and\r\ncollect in the oviducts, the walls of the latter become stretched, and\r\nthis portion forms two uterus-like structures. The terminal division of\r\nthe two passages forms their vaginal portions. But since there is no\r\ncommon vagina, there are no unpaired glands and no receptaculum seminis.\r\nThe two ducts become open after the last shedding of the skin.\r\n\r\nPalmén adds that this paired or double nature of the sexual glands and\r\ntheir external ducts in this group of insects occurs in some Myriopoda\r\n(Fig. 3, _E_, _F_) and a few Arachnida (Fig. 3, _C_, _D_, the outlets\r\nbeing in this class unpaired), numerous Crustacea, and most worms; and\r\nas already stated it is very marked in Limulus, where the paired outlets\r\nare in both sexes very simple and wide apart (Fig. 3, _A_). In the worms\r\nthe paired genital ducts are modified segmental organs. As we have seen,\r\nin the young male Lepisma there are two male genital openings. Hence\r\nthis double nature of the genital passages in the may-flies seems to be\r\nvery primitive.\r\n\r\nIn the Dermaptera, also, the genus Labidura was found by Meinert to have\r\ntwo independent ductus ejaculatorii, opening externally in double\r\nexternal slit-like processes (_penes_). The two ducts arise from a\r\nsingle seminal vesicle, which is either paired (_L. advena_), or forms a\r\ncommon passage (_L. gigantea_). In Forficula (Fig. 464, _B_) only one\r\nejaculatory duct persists, the other is obliterated, and one of the\r\npenes is atrophied, the other assuming a position in the middle line of\r\nthe body. Thus the single ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicle arise\r\nfrom the primitive vasa deferentia, and not from the integument of the\r\nbody, as is the case in the following examples.\r\n\r\n  According to the researches of Dufour, Loew, etc., most species of\r\n  Orthoptera (Œdipoda), Libellula, Perla, Panorpa, Rhaphidia,\r\n  Myrmeleon, Sialis, and Trichoptera (Hydropsyche) have double vasa\r\n  deferentia and seminal vesicles, and two ejaculatory ducts. The male\r\n  genital passages of Rhaphidia have a double opening, Loew describing\r\n  “the two seminal vesicles as lying near each other and at last\r\n  uniting in a common passage, with an external opening, which,\r\n  however, must be very short, since I could only once clearly observe\r\n  it.” This opening is a deep invagination of the external integument,\r\n  at the bottom of which the two ducts open independently of each\r\n  other. In such insects, Palmén states that the single ejaculatory\r\n  duct morphologically arises by an invagination of the integument.\r\n\r\n  In another group, forming, as regards the genital apparatus, a step\r\n  next above the Ephemeridæ, viz. the Perlidæ, the oviducts open near\r\n  each other at the bottom of a median single “vagina,” situated\r\n  between the 7th and 8th abdominal segment; it is covered beneath by\r\n  a valve-like, enlarged sternite of the preceding segment, and Palmén\r\n  homologizes it with the ovi-valvula of some Ephemeridæ. He regards\r\n  this bell-shaped vagina as a cup-like, deep, intersegmental fold,\r\n  which projects into the body-cavity and there receives the two\r\n  ducts.\r\n\r\n  This differentiation in the Perlidæ may be regarded as the type for\r\n  several groups of insects. But in others occur a complication which\r\n  in some degree modifies the type. Thus the invagination arises out\r\n  from one segment alone, but several segments during metamorphosis\r\n  may become so reduced that the ventral portions of all may be\r\n  invaginated to form the vagina. Thus in the larva of Corethra,\r\n  according to Leydig, and also Weismann, the two testes are attached\r\n  by two cords to the integument; the hinder ones are inserted\r\n  independently, and share in the development of the outlets.\r\n\r\n  Graber has observed the same relations in the pupa of Chironomus,\r\n  the efferent genital tubes in both sexes being separate, so that\r\n  there are two vaginal passages and two penes present. Palmén\r\n  comments on these relations in the dipterous insects, remarking that\r\n  during metamorphosis certain parts of the terminal abdominal\r\n  segments are reduced, while others are hypertrophied; hence the\r\n  points of insertion of the cords referred to becoming the openings\r\n  of the vasa are carried within the abdomen; and this part of the\r\n  integument becomes an unpaired section. In these insects, also,\r\n  there is an unpaired vesicula seminalis, but its morphological\r\n  nature (whether formed from the integumental duct or the fused vasa\r\n  deferentia) can only be settled after special investigation.\r\n\r\n  In the Lepidoptera, also, it has been shown by Herold, Suckow,\r\n  Bessels, and recently with full details by Jackson, that the paired\r\n  larval oviducts are at first solid, but become tubular early in\r\n  pupal life. A little later, their cavities open into that of the\r\n  azygos or unpaired oviduct. The paired oviducts open in the female\r\n  caterpillars on the hind edge of the 7th abdominal segment,\r\n  afterwards uniting with the unpaired vagina of the 8th segment,\r\n  which is developed from the hypodermis.\r\n\r\n  Jackson adds that there are three stages traceable in the evolution\r\n  of the genital ducts of Lepidoptera: “an ephemeridal stage, which\r\n  ends towards the close of larval life; an orthopteran stage,\r\n  indicated during the quiescent period preceding pupation; and a\r\n  lepidopteran stage, which begins with the commencement of pupal\r\n  life.”\r\n\r\nAs a summary of these results it appears that the genital organs of\r\ninsects consist of two morphologically different elements: 1. the\r\nprimitive internal paired structures (testes with the vasa deferentia;\r\novaries with the ovarian tubes), and 2. integumental structures (Fig.\r\n464). In the most primitive winged insects (Ephemeridæ) the latter\r\nstructures are only represented by the two external sexual openings, the\r\nentire reproductive system being paired. The paired parts become in the\r\nmore highly differentiated forms united into single parts, while, _a_, a\r\ncommon integumental division, grows in, forming the ductus\r\nejaculatorius, or the vagina; or, _b_, the inner passages anastomose\r\ntogether, _i.e._ the openings fuse together; or, _c_, both of these\r\ncases occur at once; or, finally, we have _d_, where the superfluous\r\npaired parts by reduction become single.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 464.—Evolution of the unpaired from the paired sexual organs of\r\n    insects: _A-E_, male organs. The parts arising by invagination of\r\n    the integument indicated by thick black lines. _A_, an Ephemerid.\r\n    _B_, _Forficula auricularia_. _C_, nymph of Orthoptera in general.\r\n    _D_, Œdipoda. _E_, _Cetonia aurata_. _F_, female organs of\r\n    Æschna.—After Palmén, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe male ducts open behind the 9th, the female passages of Ephemerids\r\nbehind the 7th abdominal segment, those of other insects behind the 8th,\r\nexcept in the Stylopidæ (Strepsiptera), in which they open much in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nFigure 464 graphically shows their relation. In the Odonata (_F_) the\r\nchitinous lining or integumental invagination extends inwards where the\r\ntwo oviducts begin, in the Coleoptera (_E_) the vagina, bursa\r\ncopulatrix, and receptaculum seminis being lined by a thick chitinous\r\nlayer. While in Perla the two seminal ducts pass directly into the\r\ncopulatory organ, in the Coleoptera they open into the unpaired ductus\r\nejaculatorius at a distance from the copulatory organ.\r\n\r\nThe morphological results obtained by Palmén, and for the Lepidoptera by\r\nJackson, were apparently confirmed from an embryological point of view\r\nby Nusbaum, from observations on the development of the sexual passages\r\nin two genera of Pediculidæ, and are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. The prevalent impression that the larval ducts unite with each\r\n  other and give origin to the whole system of sexual ducts is\r\n  incorrect; they form only the vasa deferentia or the oviducts.\r\n\r\n  2. All other parts of the efferent apparatus (uterus, vagina,\r\n  receptaculum seminis, ductus ejaculatorius, penis, and appended\r\n  glands) develop from the hypodermis.\r\n\r\n  3. The connective tissue and the musculature of the efferent\r\n  apparatus are derived from mesoblast cells present in the\r\n  body-cavity.\r\n\r\n  4. The efferent ducts originate as paired rudiments. All unpaired\r\n  (azygos) parts (uterus, penis, receptaculum seminis, unpaired\r\n  glands, etc.) are at first paired. The unpaired efferent apparatus\r\n  of insects must therefore be regarded as morphologically a secondary\r\n  and more complicated form.[76]\r\n\r\n  5. The male and female efferent ducts are strictly homologous.\r\n\r\n  6. The cavities of the oviducts, uterus, vagina in the female, of\r\n  the vasa deferentia, appended organs, and ductus ejaculatorius of\r\n  the male arise independently, and come into connection secondarily.\r\n\r\n  The presence of two genital openings, viz. a bursa copulatrix or\r\n  copulatory pouch, and of the primitive oviducal orifice behind the\r\n  9th segment, is peculiar to Lepidoptera, and the inquiry naturally\r\n  arises whether they represent the outlets of two pairs of segmental\r\n  organs. The question has been fully set at rest, however, by\r\n  Jackson, who shows that the copulatory pouch is a secondary\r\n  invagination of the ectoderm, being derived from the hypodermis,\r\n  while the second aperture is a special adaptation. It is, however,\r\n  the partial homologue of the vaginal orifice in other orders of\r\n  insects. It opens behind the sternite of the 8th abdominal segment,\r\n  the typical position of the vaginal aperture as shown by\r\n  Lacaze-Duthiers. The lateral position of the bursa and its\r\n  separation from the azygos oviduct are probably late features in the\r\n  phylogenetic history of the Lepidoptera, subsequent even to the\r\n  closure of the furrow.\r\n\r\n  “The existence of a second or posterior aperture is probably to be\r\n  attributed to the advantage gained by a terminal position for the\r\n  aperture through which the ova are laid. The remarkable way in which\r\n  this aperture shifts backwards seems to point very distinctly to\r\n  this explanation, especially as the Lepidoptera are entirely devoid\r\n  of the outgrowths which form the ovipositor in some orders; _e.g._\r\n  most Orthoptera.”\r\n\r\n  The original condition of things appears to have been retained in a\r\n  moth, _Nematois metallicus_, which, according to Cholodkowsky,\r\n  possesses but a single external aperture, the bursa opening into the\r\n  dorsal wall of the unpaired oviduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _a._ The male organs of reproduction\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that the testes with their efferent ducts are, like the\r\novaries and egg-tubes, primitive structures, there are various secondary\r\nor adaptive structures which are either due (1) to modifications of the\r\nmale efferent ducts, or of the ovarian tubes, or (2) to various\r\naccessory organs, mostly glandular, resulting from the invagination of\r\nthe ectoderm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 465.—_A_, diagram of male sexual organs of Carabus. _B_, of\r\n    Blaps. _C_, of Hydrophilus. The heavy black lines represent the\r\n    ectodermal organs; _t_, testis; _a. g._, accessory glands.—After\r\n    Escherich.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe male organs are, then, the following:—\r\n\r\n1. Two testes (Figs. 465–469, _t_, _H_, _ho_).\r\n\r\n2. The two seminal ducts (_vasa deferentia_, _v_, _sl_, _SL_), whose\r\nlower or outer (distal) division becomes enlarged and acts as a seminal\r\nvesicle (_vesicula seminalis_; Figs. 467–469, _bl_, _SB_).\r\n\r\n3. The common ejaculatory duct (_ductus ejaculatorius_), with the penis\r\n(Figs. 467–469, _ag_, _uSG_).\r\n\r\n4. Accessory glands at the base of the vasa deferentia (_glandulæ\r\nmucosæ_, Figs. 465–469, _a. g._, _dr_, _D_), whose secretion mixes with\r\nthe semen or serves for the formation of the seminal packets\r\n(sematophores).\r\n\r\n  In his paper on the internal male organs of beetles, Escherich\r\n  states that those of the Carabidæ illustrate the simplest, most\r\n  primitive condition (Fig. 465). A simple blind tube on each side\r\n  produces spermatozoa, stores the elements, and secretes mucus. Each\r\n  of these tubes opens into a somewhat larger duct, and the two unite\r\n  in a common ejaculatory canal. The terminal portion in these beetles\r\n  is lined with chitin, and is therefore ectodermal, and not the\r\n  result of the union of the mesodermic vasa deferentia. The region\r\n  corresponding to the testes, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles\r\n  are mesodermic. Blaps (Fig. 465, _B_) is intermediate between the\r\n  Carabidæ and Hydrophilus (Fig. 465, _C_). The accessory glands (_a.\r\n  g._) are developed, and the seminal vesicles are situated in the\r\n  middle, and not at the lower end of the vasa deferentia, as in\r\n  Hydrophilus.\r\n\r\n=The testes.=—Each testis is composed of follicles or corresponding\r\nparts, which according to the group of insects in which they occur are\r\nunited in different ways; or each testis consists of a single hank or\r\nskein-like blind tube which is enveloped by a membrane, as in the\r\nCarabidæ, Dyticidæ, or Lucanidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 466.—_t_, testis; _v_, vas deferens; _g_, seminal vesicle of\r\n    _Acheta campestris_.—After Carus, from Gegenbaur.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 467.—Male sexual apparatus of a bark-beetle: _sl_, vas deferens;\r\n    _ho_, testis; _bl_, seminal vesicle; _dr_, accessory gland; _ag_,\r\n    ductus ejaculatorius.—After Graber.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe number of testicular tubes is small in most Hemiptera, but very\r\ngreat in the Cicadidæ, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and many Hymenoptera.\r\nAlthough the testes are usually separated from each other, they are\r\nclosely united in certain Orthoptera (Gryllotalpa, Ephippigera),\r\nColeoptera (Galerucella), in many Lepidoptera, and in a number of\r\nHymenoptera (Scolia, Pompilus, Crabro, and others).\r\n\r\nThe two testes of most Lepidoptera are so closely grown together or\r\ncoalesced into a single body that one might regard them as a single\r\ntestis. But in the different families there occur all grades, from the\r\nunpaired testes of most Lepidoptera to Hepialus with separate testes.\r\nCholodkowsky therefore distinguishes four types:—\r\n\r\n  1. The embryonal or primitive type, with two testes, whose seminal\r\n  follicles are entirely separate. (Brandt.) These testes are\r\n  contained, as in all other Lepidoptera, in a well-developed thick\r\n  chitinous membrane or scrotum, analogous to that of the higher\r\n  vertebrates, which envelops each separate seminal follicle\r\n  (_Hepialus humuli_).\r\n\r\n  2. The larval type, with two testes, whose four follicles are\r\n  enclosed by a common scrotal membrane (_Bombyx mori_, _Gastropacha\r\n  quercifolia_, _Ichthyura anachoreta_ and _anastomosis_, _Saturnia\r\n  pyri_, _Aglia tau_).\r\n\r\n  3. The pupal type (since it first occurs in the pupa state), with a\r\n  single testis, which possesses an external median lace-like\r\n  covering. (Adela, Lycæna.)\r\n\r\n  4. The imaginal type, with a single testis enveloped by a lace-like\r\n  scrotum, within which the follicles are wound around the\r\n  longitudinal axis of the testis. (Most Lepidoptera.)\r\n\r\n  In Nematois there are twenty seminal follicles, the number of\r\n  ovarian tubes being the same. (Cholodkowsky.)\r\n\r\n  In many insects the testes are not composed of tubes (follicles),\r\n  but of button-like bodies, each of which has its own duct.\r\n\r\n  The color of the testes is usually white, but they may be orange\r\n  (Decticus), yellowish green (_Locusta viridissima_), or deep yellow\r\n  (Chrysopa).\r\n\r\n  The testes of Asilid flies are enveloped by a common dark-red\r\n  membrane rich in tracheæ, like that in Lepidoptera which clothes the\r\n  separate testicular follicles. The two testes of Calliphora are\r\n  enveloped by an orange-yellow capsule, outside of which is a special\r\n  membrane formed by the fat-body. (Cholodkowsky.)\r\n\r\n  In the honey-bee the testis has two envelopes, the outer of which is\r\n  formed by the fat-body, the inner coat of connective tissue. The\r\n  entire testis corresponds to a portion only of that of _Bombyx\r\n  mori_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 468.—Male organs of a weevil, _Hylobius abietis_: _H_, testis;\r\n    _SL_, vas deferens; _D_, slime gland; _SB_, seminal vesicle; _uSG_,\r\n    ejaculatory duct.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 469.—Male organs of Tomicus. Lettering same as in Fig. 468.—This\r\n    and Fig. 468 from Judeich and Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The seminal ducts.=—The vasa deferentia are fine tubes, which vary much\r\nin length; being short in many beetles and locusts, very short in many\r\nDiptera (Syrphidæ, etc.), very long in Cicada and many beetles;\r\naccording to Burmeister, being in Dyticus about five times, in\r\nNecrophorus and Blaps eight to ten times, in Cicada 14 times, in\r\n_Cetonia aurata_ 30 times, as long as the body. They either resemble a\r\nskein of silk, or form a tangled mass.\r\n\r\nThe distal or lower end of the vasa is in many insects dilated into a\r\nsac or seminal vesicle, which serves for the reception and storage of\r\nthe seminal fluid after it passes through the vasa deferentia. In the\r\nhoney-bee the vas deferens is given off from the reservoir, forms loops\r\nin and outside of the testis, and passes to the seminal vesicle. The\r\ncanal into which the vesicle narrows does not open into the ductus\r\nejaculatorius, but into the glandulæ mucosæ; its epithelial cells are\r\nmuch vacuolated, and have, therefore, a spongy appearance.\r\n(Koschewnikoff.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 470.—_A_, spermatozoön of a beetle (Copris), partly macerated to\r\n    show structure of flagellum, which consists of a supporting fibre\r\n    (_s.f_) and a fin-like envelope (_f_); _n_, nucleus; _a_, _a_,\r\n    apical body divided into two parts. _B_, anterior part of that of\r\n    Calathus, with barbed head and finmembrane.—After Ballowitz, from\r\n    Wilson.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The ejaculatory duct= during coition conducts the sperm into the\r\ncopulatory pouch of the female. In consequence of the stretching of the\r\nintegumental membrane the end of the duct can be erected and again\r\nwithdrawn. For this purpose the end of the duct is thickened and is said\r\nto be provided with powerful muscles. The evaginable terminal portion is\r\ncovered by a strong chitinous membrane forming the penis or intromittent\r\norgan (Fig: 462, _h_), which is externally enveloped by a pair of\r\nchitinous lobes, which in many beetles are converted into a capsule. The\r\nductus ejaculatorius of the honey-bee is inserted by two chitinous\r\nbranches into the point of union of the two glandulæ mucosæ; it and the\r\nentire copulatory apparatus are devoid of muscles, though it is,\r\nhowever, well developed beneath the mucous glands. (Koschewnikoff.)\r\n\r\n=The accessory glands= of the vasa deferentia are tubes whose secretions\r\neither directly mix with the semen, or in many cases form seminal\r\npackets (_spermatophores_). In Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera\r\nthere is usually one pair. In many insects there are several pairs, as\r\nin Hydrophilidæ and Elateridæ; they are branched in Hemiptera, and in\r\nOrthoptera bushy. The single glandular tubules are very long, and form a\r\nskein-like mass. In Orthoptera, in the larger number of accessory\r\nglands, two forms may be distinguished, which differ from each other in\r\ntheir contents (Siebold). In the cockroach (Fig. 461) these glands form\r\nthe “mushroom” shaped gland of Huxley, which was at first regarded as\r\nthe testis.\r\n\r\n=The spermatozoa.=—These very minute bodies, the sexual homologues of\r\nthe eggs, abound in the seminal fluid, and are formed in the follicles\r\nof the testes from a germinal layer or epithelium, as are the eggs. They\r\nare hair- or thread-like, usually consisting of a head, a body or\r\nmiddle-piece, and a long, thread-like tail (flagellum), which vibrates\r\nrapidly, causing the spermatozoön to move actively forwards (Fig. 470).\r\n\r\n  In beetles, according to Ballowitz, there are two main types of\r\n  spermatozoa, connected, however, by intermediate forms. There is a\r\n  double-tailed type, already described by Bütschli and v. la Valette\r\n  St. George, and there are others which are single-tailed. Bütschli\r\n  showed that in the double spermatozoön one tail-filament is straight\r\n  and stiff, the other being undulating and contractile. Ballowitz\r\n  describes this type in Calathus (Fig. 470, _B_), Chrysomela, and\r\n  Hylobius, etc., and shows that the straight or supporting portion of\r\n  the tail is elastic, but somewhat stiff, resistant to reagents, and\r\n  without any fibrillar structure, while the contractile fringe\r\n  consists of an extremely complicated system of fibrils (Fig. 470).\r\n  The single-tailed type of spermatozoön, as seen, _e.g._, in\r\n  Melolontha and Hydrophilus, has no supporting fibres. The tail is\r\n  twisted in a spiral, corresponds to the contractile fringe of the\r\n  double type, and exhibits a complicated fibrillar structure. The\r\n  fringed type works its way ahead like the screw of a steamer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 471.—_C_, anterior end of spermatid of a moth (Pygæra). _D_,\r\n    young spermatozoön of the same; _af_, axial filament; _c_,\r\n    centrosome; _m_, middle-piece or _mitosoma_; _n_, nucleus; _p_,\r\n    paranucleus; _e_, envelope of the tail.—After Platner, from Wilson.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEach spermatozoön is a modified but complete cell, and the nucleus\r\ncontains the chromatin, a deeply staining substance of the nuclear\r\nnetwork and of the chromosomes and the supposed bearer of heredity.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the spermatozoön.=—It arises from a primordial germcell\r\ncalled _spermatogonium_. This cell contains a large, pale nucleus and a\r\ndark body, the accessory nucleus of Bütschli. The _spermatogonia_\r\nsubdivide, but at a certain period pause in their subdivisions, and\r\nundergo considerable growth. “Each spermatogonium is thus converted into\r\na _spermatocyte_, which, by two rapidly succeeding divisions gives rise\r\nto four spermatozoa, as follows: The primary spermatocyte first divides\r\nto form two daughter-cells, known as spermatocytes of the second order,\r\nor sperm mother-cells. Each of these divides again—as a rule without\r\npausing, and without the reconstruction of the daughter-nuclei—to form\r\ntwo _spermatids_ or sperm-cells. Each of the four spermatids is then\r\ndirectly transformed into a single spermatozoön; its nucleus becoming\r\nvery small and compact, its cytoplasm giving rise to the tail and to\r\ncertain other structures.... As the spermatid develops into the\r\nspermatozoön, it assumes an elongated form, the nucleus lying at one\r\nend, while the cytoplasm is drawn out to form the flagellum at the\r\nopposite end.” (Wilson’s The Cell, from La Valette St. George.)\r\n\r\nHenking finds that the primordial sperm-cells correspond to the\r\nprimordial ova, both forms of cells in the insect he studied containing\r\nthe characteristic number of twenty-four chromosomes.\r\n\r\n  The spermatogenesis of Laphria, according to Cholodkowsky, is very\r\n  peculiar, and strongly resembles that described by Verson in _Bombyx\r\n  mori_. In the blind end of the testicular tubes lies a colossal cell\r\n  visible to the naked eye, the spermatogone, from which the entire\r\n  contents of the testes originate. In Bombyx this spermatogone\r\n  appears in the larva state. Such colossal spermatogones also occur\r\n  in Lepidoptera of different families (Hyponomeuta, Vanessa, and in\r\n  the pupa of _Chareas graminis_), in Trichoptera, and in Hemiptera\r\n  (Syromastes); and Cholodkowsky inquires whether they may not be\r\n  typical of insects. Toyama has observed these colossal cells not\r\n  only in the testes but also in the ovaries of the silkworm. He\r\n  regards them as supporting cells.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa are inclined to remain in bundles, and in this state are\r\nexpelled during copulation. These bundles are either root-like, bushy,\r\nstring-like, sinuous, or worm-like.\r\n\r\n  Auerbach has observed the spermatozoa of _Dyticus marginalis_ in\r\n  their passage through the convoluted seminal vesicles. All those\r\n  arising from one testicular tube are united in a bundle. Each has a\r\n  very complex structure, bilateral but unsymmetrical. The right side\r\n  of the head is concave, the left convex; the whole head is\r\n  longitudinally curved to right or left; and on the posterior half of\r\n  the right side there is a projecting ridge bearing a hook-shaped\r\n  cyanophilous “anchor,” at the free end of which an erythrophilous\r\n  spherule appears. The most remarkable fact is that the spermatozoa\r\n  unite in pairs in a perfectly definite way, opposed and crossed in a\r\n  manner somewhat suggestive of a pair of scissors, with the right\r\n  sides of the heads in contact. During this conjugation, or\r\n  “dejugation” as Auerbach calls it, the anchors change their shape,\r\n  and the little spherules are lost. Hundreds of these double\r\n  spermatozoa are found together in little balls. The conjugation is a\r\n  temporary one, but it may permit a molecular exchange of substance,\r\n  perhaps with the result of mixing the hereditary qualities and\r\n  limiting variability. (Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc., 1893, p. 622.)\r\n\r\nIn many insects which lack a true penis, the bundle of spermatozoa are\r\nunited in the ejaculatory duct, forming packets which are enveloped by\r\nthe secretion of the accessory glands which stiffens into a hard case.\r\nThese packets are called _spermatophores_. They are either introduced\r\ninto the vagina of the female or simply remain outside. Graber has\r\nrepeatedly observed that the male crickets, in the absence of the\r\nfemale, let their spermatophores fall to the earth; whether it is\r\nafterwards made available is not known, because hitherto no case is\r\nreported that females seeking impregnation search, as in the case of the\r\nIsopod crustacean, Porcellio, for the spermatophores.\r\n\r\n  In the Gryllidæ and Locustidæ the spermatophore lies in a cup-like\r\n  cavity under the penis. This is called the “spermatophore cup”\r\n  (Chadima, 1871), into which the ejaculatory duct of the testis\r\n  opens.\r\n\r\n  According to the views of Schneider, the spermatophores, with their\r\n  capsule, usually consist solely of seminal filaments, which stick\r\n  closely to each other, and only exceptionally have a capsule formed\r\n  by a glandular secretion. In Locusta, however, and perhaps also in\r\n  Gryllus, the sperm is enveloped by the secretion of the accessory\r\n  glands of the seminal ducts; the spermatophores pass, still fluid,\r\n  out of the sexual opening of the male into that of the female, but\r\n  become chilled on the outer surface, so that the sperm, without\r\n  coming in contact with the air, passes into the receptaculum\r\n  seminis.\r\n\r\n  The mode of grouping of the spermatozoa of the Locustidæ as they\r\n  occur in the spermatheca of the female is remarkable. Their heads\r\n  lie so close to each other that they form a long shaft, while the\r\n  numerous threads are arranged so as to look like the two vanes of a\r\n  feather, the entire mass being like a very long heron’s feather.\r\n  (Siebold.)\r\n\r\n  In the honey-bee the spermatophore is likewise enveloped by the\r\n  secretion of the accessory glands, and thereby becomes a sort of\r\n  seminal cartridge. This is a peculiar oval body which is carried\r\n  during the marriage-flight into the air within the upper part of the\r\n  penis, the so-called penis-bulb. (Leuckart.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _b._ The female organs of reproduction\r\n\r\nThe different parts of the female reproductive organs are the following:\r\n\r\n1. The two ovaries.\r\n\r\n2. The two oviducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 472.—Female organs of generation of a saw-fly (_Athalia\r\n    centifoliæ_): _a_, _b_, _c_, the 18 ovarial tubes originating from\r\n    each of the two oviducts (_d_), and containing the immature eggs;\r\n    _e_, common oviduct; _f_, spermatheca; _g_, poison-sac; _h_,\r\n    poison-glands; 10, last ganglion.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The common egg-passage in nearly all insects (its distal or\r\nhindermost part forming the uterus or vagina).\r\n\r\n4. The receptaculum seminis, or spermatheca.\r\n\r\n5. The bursa copulatrix, or copulatory pouch.\r\n\r\n6. The accessory glands (cement, sebific, or colleterial glands, or “oil\r\nreservoirs,” glandulæ sebaceæ, coleterium).\r\n\r\n=The ovaries and the ovarian tubes.=—As in the testes, so each ovary\r\nconsists of a variable number of ovarian tubes, by some called\r\n_ovarioles_, united by a thread at the distal end, and at the lower or\r\nhinder end opening into the oviduct. Each ovarian or egg tube is divided\r\ninto three sections: (1) the terminal thread; (2) the terminal chamber,\r\nand (3) the actual ovarian tube, or chambered main division, this\r\nforming the longest part of the egg-tube.\r\n\r\nThe slender terminal thread serves to attach or suspend each egg-tube\r\nnear the dorsal vessel (not directly to the heart, as formerly\r\nsupposed), becoming lost in the fat-body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 473.—Ovarian tube of _P. orientalis_: _A_, section near the end;\r\n    _tf_, base of terminal filament. _B_, section lower down; _ec_,\r\n    egg-cells in egg-chamber.—After Brandt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe terminal chamber contains undifferentiated cell elements, supposed\r\nto be the remains of the ovarian rudiments. From these arise (either in\r\nthe embryo or larva) first, the follicle epithelium of the ovarian\r\ntubes; and, second, the material for the formation of the new eggs, and\r\nnutritive cells. “In the terminal chamber these cell-elements remain\r\nundifferentiated, excepting when required for the removal of the\r\nfollicle epithelium, eggs, and nutritive cells in the adult insect.”\r\n(Lang.) This portion of the ovariole is called the _germarium_. In\r\nBlatta it is filled with protoplasm in which numerous small nuclei are\r\nimbedded. (Wheeler.) The chambered main division of the egg-tube\r\ncontains the ripening eggs, one in each compartment, the tube appearing\r\nlike a string of beads.\r\n\r\nThe egg-tubes are of two types: (1) those without, and (2) those with\r\nnutritive cells, the first kind being the simplest, and occurring in the\r\nSynaptera (except Campodea) and in Orthoptera. As an example may be\r\ncited that of the cockroach (Fig. 473), where in each tube there is a\r\nsimple continuous row of eggs from the terminal chamber to the oviduct.\r\nThe tube being constricted between these consecutive eggs, gives it a\r\nbeaded appearance.\r\n\r\n  In the cockroach (_Periplaneta orientalis_) each egg-tube has a\r\n  beaded appearance. Its wall consists of a transparent elastic\r\n  membrane, lined by epithelium, with an external peritoneal layer of\r\n  connective tissue. The terminal filament (_tf_) is filled with a\r\n  clear protoplasm, with a few nuclei. In the terminal chamber (_tc_)\r\n  are large nucleated cells, with separate nuclei, both entangled in a\r\n  network of protoplasm. In the third, or egg-chamber (_ec_), are\r\n  about twenty ripening eggs, arranged in a single row. “Between and\r\n  around the eggs the nuclei gradually arrange themselves into\r\n  one-layered follicles, which are attached, not to the wall of the\r\n  tubes, but to the eggs, and travel downwards with them. As the eggs\r\n  descend, the yolk which they contain increases rapidly, and the\r\n  germinal vesicle and spot (nucleus and nucleolus), which were at\r\n  first plain, disappear. A vitelline membrane is secreted by the\r\n  inner surface and a chitinous chorion by the outer surface of the\r\n  egg-follicle.\r\n\r\n  “The lowest egg in an ovarian tube is nearly or altogether of the\r\n  full size; it is of elongate-oval figure, and slightly curved, the\r\n  convexity being turned towards the uterus. It is filled with a clear\r\n  albuminous fluid, which mainly consists of yolk. The chorion now\r\n  forms a transparent yellowish capsule, which, under the microscope,\r\n  appears to be divided up into very many polygonal areas, defined by\r\n  rows of fine dots. These areas probably correspond to as many\r\n  follicular cells.” (Brandt, from Miall and Denny.)\r\n\r\n  In the second type, _i.e._ those egg-tubes with nutritive cells,\r\n  there are two kinds. In the first the egg-chambers and yolk- or\r\n  nutritive chambers alternate, each of the latter containing one or\r\n  more nutritive cells, which serve for the nourishment of the\r\n  ripening egg contained in the neighboring chamber. “The egg- and\r\n  yolk-chambers may be distinctly separated externally by\r\n  constrictions (Hymenoptera and many Coleoptera), or one nutritive\r\n  and one egg-chamber may lie in each section of the ovarian tube,\r\n  which is externally visible as a swelling (Lepidoptera, Diptera).”\r\n\r\n  In the second kind with nutritive cells, the actual tube consists\r\n  (Fig. 474, _C_) of ovarian chambers only; the nutritive cells here\r\n  remain massed together in the large terminal chamber. The single egg\r\n  in the tube is united with the terminal chamber by connective\r\n  strands (_d. s._), which convey the nutritive material to the eggs.\r\n  (Lang.)\r\n\r\n  Egg-cells, nutritive cells, and the cells of the follicle-epithelium\r\n  (epithelium of the chambers of the ovarian tubes) are, says Lang,\r\n  according to their origin, similar elements, like the egg and\r\n  yolk-cells of the flat worms (Platodes); division of labor leads to\r\n  their later differentiation. Only a few of the numerous egg-germs\r\n  develop into eggs, the rest serving as envelopes and as food for\r\n  these few.\r\n\r\n  Korschelt considers that all the chief elements of the egg-tubes,\r\n  viz. egg, nutritive, and epithelial cells, arise by a direct\r\n  transformation of the elements of the terminal chamber, and that the\r\n  last may be traced to the indifferent elements of the terminal\r\n  thread, the elements in question originating from the nuclear\r\n  elements by a breaking down of the syncytium (or masses of\r\n  protoplasm with nuclei scattered through it) composing it (Fig.\r\n  475).\r\n\r\n  The latest work is that of Wielowiejski (Zoologische Anzeiger, ix,\r\n  1886, p. 132), whose observations are based on a study of the\r\n  ovarian tubes and the growing eggs of the Hemiptera (Pyrrhocoris),\r\n  the Coleoptera (Telephorus, Saperda, Cetonia and Melolontha,\r\n  Carabidæ, and Hydradephaga), etc.\r\n\r\n  Wielowiejski divides the ovaries of insects into three groups:—\r\n\r\n  1. Comprising such ovaries in the ends of whose egg-tubes (terminal\r\n  filament) the embryonal cells in the early stages are accumulated,\r\n  and are transformed into egg-, yolk-, and epithelial cells\r\n  respectively. (Ovaries of Orthoptera, geodephagous and\r\n  hydradephagous Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera).\r\n\r\n  2. Comprising ovaries whose ends above the egg-cells and egg-germs\r\n  (_Eianlagen_) possess throughout life a more or less voluminous\r\n  solid accumulation of cells (terminal chamber), but which stand in\r\n  no close relation with the first. (Ovaries of Coleoptera, with the\r\n  exception of the Geodephaga and Hydradephaga, and Aphidæ in part.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 474.—Various types of ovarian tubes, diagrammatic: _A_, ovarian\r\n    tube without nutritive cells. _B_, egg-tube with alternating\r\n    nutritive and egg-compartments. _C_, ovarian tubes in which the\r\n    terminal chamber (_ek_) is developed into a nutritive chamber,\r\n    with which the developing eggs remain connected by means of\r\n    threads (_ds_); _ef_, terminal filaments; _efa_, egg compartments\r\n    or chambers; _fe_, follicle epithelium; _df_, yolk-chambers.—After\r\n    Lang (_C_ from Claus).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 475.—Upper portion of the ovary in Forficula, showing eggs and\r\n    nurse-cells; below, a portion of the nearly ripe egg (_e_) showing\r\n    deutoplasm-spheres and germinal vesicle (_gv_).

Comprising ovaries whose ends above the egg-germs contain a\r\n  well-developed mass of cells functioning as a yolk-forming organ,\r\n  between whose special elements grow root-like offshoots of nearly\r\n  ripe egg-cells. (Hemiptera.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 478.—Ovary of a beetle, drawn somewhat diagrammatically: _o_,\r\n    egg-tube; _s_, stalk of the same; _c_, egg-calyx; _ov_,\r\n    oviduct.—After Korschelt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the egg is ripe the food-chamber disappears because its contents\r\nhave served for the formation of the egg below it. In Lepidoptera\r\nespecially, the egg-tubes resemble strings of pearls because most of the\r\nnumerous eggs ripen simultaneously and are likewise deposited at the\r\nsame period, which is naturally not the case in those insects whose eggs\r\ngradually ripen (Fig. 477). In other cases the egg- or food-compartments\r\nare transformed into each other, but only one egg- and one\r\nfood-compartment can be situated in the same dilatation of the ovarian\r\ntube. Finally, there are insects in whose egg-tubes the egg-compartments\r\nare arranged in a single row, while the capacious terminal chamber\r\ncontains a large mass of food-cells.\r\n\r\nEgg-cells, nutritive cells, as well as the cells of the follicle\r\nepithelium (epithelium of the chambers of the ovarian tubes), originate\r\nas similar or homologous elements, division of labor leading to their\r\nlater differentiation. Only a few of the numerous egg-germs develop into\r\neggs, the rest serving as envelopes and also as food for these few.\r\n(Lang.)\r\n\r\nIn many insects the egg-tubes open into an egg-calyx (Fig. 478, _c_), in\r\nwhich the ripe eggs collect before passing into the oviduct (_ov_).\r\n\r\n  As the result of his investigations on the origin of the cellular\r\n  elements of the ovaries of insects Korschelt concludes:—\r\n\r\n  1. The different cell-elements of the egg-tubes, eggs, nutritive\r\n  cells, and epithelium arise from identical undifferentiated elements\r\n  situated in the contents of the earliest germ of the egg-tubes.\r\n\r\n  2. The first formation of the cellular elements present, and the\r\n  differentiation of the individual compartments of the egg-tube,\r\n  occur during embryonic and larval life.\r\n\r\n  3. The undifferentiated elements of the terminal chamber correspond\r\n  to the embryonic condition, while in post-embryonic time, and even\r\n  during imaginal life, a new formation of the different kinds of\r\n  cells takes place.\r\n\r\n  4. The mode of origin of the different kinds of cells from the\r\n  undifferentiated elements varies greatly in different insects.\r\n\r\n  5. From their histological nature, and from the mode of origin of\r\n  their elements, the most complex egg-tubes and those provided with\r\n  nutritive compartments are phylogenetically derived from those\r\n  without such nutritive compartments.\r\n\r\n  6. The nutritive cells in certain cases originate in the same way\r\n  and at the same time as the germ-cells, and are therefore to be\r\n  regarded as germ-cells which have abandoned the function of\r\n  egg-making, and exchanged it for the production of nutritive\r\n  material.\r\n\r\n  7. In the egg-tubes with numerous nutritive compartments the\r\n  nutritive cells can originate at the same place as the egg-cells,\r\n  and they afterwards still lie intermingled with these in the\r\n  beginning or upper part of the egg-tubes.\r\n\r\n  8. While the capability of egg-making of the germ-cells originally\r\n  situated in the extremity of the terminal chamber gradually becomes\r\n  transferred to those at the base of the terminal chamber, and the\r\n  first transform into nutritive cells, egg-tubes with nutritive\r\n  compartments at the base may be found.\r\n\r\n  9. The nutritive cells of certain forms arise independently of the\r\n  germ-cells and therefore could not have previously originated from\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  10. The epithelium has in all forms nearly the same mode of\r\n  formation; it everywhere shows a close similarity to the\r\n  undifferentiated elements of the terminal chamber, out of which it\r\n  directly develops. As to the fact of formation of epithelium through\r\n  the germ-vesicles (_Keimblaschen_), nutritive-cell nuclei, or the\r\n  so-called “oöblasts,” I could not feel certain.\r\n\r\n  11. Neither the eggs of Hemiptera or of other insects arise through\r\n  the agency of “oöblasts,” but like the epithelial and nutritive\r\n  cells arise by a gradual differentiation from the indifferent\r\n  elements of the ovarian tubes.\r\n\r\n  12. The different elements of the egg-tubes, also the eggs, have the\r\n  morphological value of cells.\r\n\r\n  =Origin of incipient eggs in the germ of the testes.=—Heymons has\r\n  detected in the germ of the testes of the male larvæ of\r\n  _Phyllodromia germanica_ 7 mm. in length, young or incipient eggs,\r\n  similar to those seen in the ovarian tubes of the female larva of\r\n  the same size. In another male larva of the same size also occurred\r\n  short cylindrical tubes each with a terminal thread, which had the\r\n  appearance of rudimentary egg-tubes. Hence he thinks that every part\r\n  of the genital germs (_Anlagen_) in the male, which are not\r\n  concerned in the formation of testicular follicles, represents the\r\n  germ of a female genital gland. As is well known, no insects are\r\n  hermaphroditic, but this case of the practical origin of eggs and\r\n  egg-tubes in the lowest division of the male efferent passage, which\r\n  is homologous with the egg-producing division of the female ovarian\r\n  tubes, points back to hermaphroditic ancestors. And Heymons suggests\r\n  that the frequent occurrence of hermaphroditism in insects probably\r\n  confirms this view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 479.—Abdomen of queen bee, under side, × 8: _P_, petiole; _o_,\r\n    _o_, ovaries; _hs_, position filled by honey-sac; _ds_, place\r\n    through which the digestive canal passes; _od_, oviduct; _co.d_,\r\n    common oviduct; _E_, egg passing oviduct; _s_, spermatheca; _i_,\r\n    intestine: _pb_, poison-bag; _p.g_, poison-gland; _st_, sting; _p_,\r\n    palpi. _B_, vestigial ovaries of ordinary worker; _sp_, vestigial\r\n    spermatheca. _C_, partially developed ovaries of fertile worker;\r\n    _sp_, vestigial spermatheca.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The bursa copulatrix.=—The copulatory pouch in most insects is a\r\nspecial cup-shaped appendage of the vagina adapted for the reception of\r\nthe male organ during sexual union. Its mode of formation in the\r\ncockroach is thus described by Haase:—\r\n\r\n“By the retreat of the female sexual aperture, situated in the 8th\r\nventral plate, a considerable space, the genital pouch, is produced;\r\nthis is formed chiefly by the extended connective membrane between the\r\nelongated 7th and 8th ventral plates. This serves for the development of\r\nthe egg-cocoon, which is retained by the internal appendages of the\r\nposterior gonapophyses.”\r\n\r\nThe fertilization of the female takes place once for all a long time\r\nprevious to oviposition; the semen in the receptaculum seminis passes\r\nout as the eggs slip down the egg-passage, and a spermatozoön gains\r\nentrance into the interior of the egg through the micropyle. In\r\nŒcanthus, according to Ayers, fecundation probably takes place while the\r\negg is passing into the vagina, “since it is hardly possible that the\r\nmale element could gain access to the follicles before the chorion is\r\nsecreted.”\r\n\r\nIn the Lepidoptera, as has been stated, the copulatory pouch opens\r\nseparately from the opening of the oviduct (vagina), but a slender canal\r\nconnects the pouch with the vagina (Fig. 310, _bc_). The outlet\r\n(“vagina” of Burgess) of the copulatory pouch opens between the 7th and\r\n8th segments, that of the oviduct (vagina) on the 9th segment being\r\n“situated immediately below the anus and hardly separated from it,\r\nbetween the lappets of the 9th segment.” (Burgess.) The opening of the\r\ncopulatory pouch is, as we have seen, the genuine or primitive sexual\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 480.—Spermatheca of the honey-bee, queen, × 40: _a_, space filled\r\n    by a clear fluid; _b_, mass of spermatozoa; _c_, duct; _d_, _d_,\r\n    active spermatozoa.— After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 481.—Female sexual organs of Scolytus: _ER_, egg-tubes; _pEL_,\r\n    paired oviducts; _ST_, spermatheca; _BT_, copulatory pouch; _KD_,\r\n    cement-glands; _Sch_, vagina.—After Lindeman, from Judeich and\r\n    Nitsche.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The spermatheca.=—This is a sac or pouch for the reception and storage\r\nor preservation of the semen. While in most of the higher insects it\r\nopens into the dorsal wall of the vagina (Fig. 472, _f_), in the\r\ncockroach, locusts, and grasshoppers it opens into the bursa; but in\r\nother European Orthoptera, as in most insects, it lies upon the dorsal\r\nwall of the vagina. (Berlese.) In the cockroach, it is a short tube\r\ndilated at the end and wound into a spiral of about one turn. “From the\r\ntube a cœcal process is given off, which may correspond with the\r\naccessory gland attached to the duct of the spermatheca in many insects\r\n(_e.g._ Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and some Lepidoptera). The spermatheca\r\nis filled during copulation, and is always found to contain spermatozoa\r\nin the fertile female. The spermatozoa are no doubt passed into the\r\ngenital pouch from time to time, and there fertilize the eggs descending\r\nfrom the ovarian tubes.” In Meloë the spermatheca is exceedingly large.\r\n(Miall and Denny, pp. 170, 171.)\r\n\r\n=The colleterial glands.=—We have already briefly referred to these\r\nglands. Those of the cockroaches form a number of long blind tubes\r\nopening into the vagina. They furnish the material for the egg-capsule\r\nor oötheca, viz. chitin and large crystals of oxalate of lime.\r\n\r\n  In _Phyllodromia germanica_ “these glands are glistening white till\r\n  the time of oviposition approaches, when they assume a yellow tint,\r\n  and the octahedral crystals are seen imbedded in a viscid substance\r\n  which fills their lumina. This viscid substance is soluble in\r\n  potassium hydrate, and is consequently not chitin. When excreted to\r\n  form the oötheca, it slowly hardens, deepens in color, and becomes\r\n  insoluble in potassium hydrate. Light has nothing to do with this\r\n  change, which is possibly produced by the oxygen in the air. It is\r\n  the same change which is undergone by the cuticula of the insect\r\n  itself immediately after ecdysis.” (Wheeler.)\r\n\r\n=The vagina or uterus.=—This is simply the end of the common oviduct,\r\nwhich, when dilated, is called the vagina, and, in the pupiparous forms,\r\nthe uterus.\r\n\r\nIn the cockroach the vagina opens by a median vertical slit situated in\r\nthe 8th sternite, into the genital pouch or bursa, upon the dorsal wall\r\nof which the orifice of the spermatheca is situated. In the sheep-tick\r\nthe oviduct is enlarged to form the so-called uterus, which furnishes a\r\nmilk-like secretion for the nourishment of the larva during its\r\nintra-uterine life.\r\n\r\nIn insects in general, the external opening of the vagina is simple, the\r\nchitinous structures (valves) at the opening being adapted to receive\r\nthe male intromittent organ.\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are to be deposited deep below the surface of the earth,\r\nor in wood, or in wood-boring larvæ, or in the body of caterpillars,\r\netc., they are inserted by the ovipositor (see p. 167).\r\n\r\n  _Signs of copulation in insects._—Leydig has collected, partly from\r\n  his own observations and partly from those of others, a number of\r\n  cases in which female insects bear traces of having had sexual\r\n  union, in the form of tags or plates attached to the body, and\r\n  apparently formed from material secreted by the male. Such probably\r\n  is the “pouch” on the abdomen of _Parnassius apollo_, and a somewhat\r\n  similar structure in _Fulgora laternaria_, and such is the plate\r\n  which is found on the hinder part of the abdomen of _Dyticus\r\n  latissimus_ and _D. marginalis_. Leydig compares these structures\r\n  with the white plate in _Astacus fluviatilis_, and with the little\r\n  white lid on the spider Argenna, and finds analogues among\r\n  vertebrates. (Arbeit.

EMBRYOLOGY OF INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _a._ The egg\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 482.—Female Dyticus, laying eggs: _A_, ovipositor extended. _B_,\r\n    egg of Notonecta, attached to stem of rush. _C_, egg of Dyticus,\r\n    laid in excavation in rush.—After Régimbart, from Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nInsects as a rule arise from eggs which are laid in a great variety of\r\nsituations, those species which are viviparous being exceedingly few in\r\nnumber compared with the class as a whole. It is noteworthy that Leydig\r\nhas found in the same Aphis, and even in the same ovary, an egg-tube\r\nproducing eggs, while a neighboring tube was producing viviparous\r\nindividuals.[77] The viviparous species are confined to certain\r\nMay-flies, the Aphidæ, Diptera (Sarcophaga, Tachinidæ, Œstridæ, and\r\nPupipara), and to certain Coleoptera (Stylopidæ and some Staphylinidæ).\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs laid varies from a very few, as in the Collembola and\r\nin the Psocidæ, or 15 or even less in certain fossorial wasps, and from\r\n20 to 35 in some locusts to many thousands in the social insects, the\r\nhoney-bee laying by estimate over 1,000,000 eggs in the course of her\r\nlife. Dr. Sharp thinks that from 50 to 100 may perhaps be taken as an\r\naverage number for one female to produce. The eggs of insects with a\r\ncomplete metamorphosis are said by Brauer to be smaller in proportion to\r\nthe parent than those laid by ametabolous or heterometabolous insects.\r\nIn this respect the insects are paralleled by the birds, the highest\r\nforms laying smaller eggs than the water birds, ostrich, Apteryx, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 483.—Eggs (_e_) of Hydrobius (?) and their capsules, from which\r\n    the larva, Fig. 452, hatched.—Emerton _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe egg, or ovum, when laid is not always ripe or perfect, but, as in\r\nthose of ants, continues to grow after oviposition. Others are laid some\r\ntime after the embryo has begun to form; and in the flesh-flies the\r\nlarva hatches before the egg is deposited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 484.—Egg-masses of Chironomus: _A_, string of eggs of _C.\r\n    dorsalis_, divided into sections to show both sides. _B_, twisted\r\n    fibres which traverse the string of eggs. _C_, egg-mass of\r\n    Chironomus (_sp_). _D_, egg-mass of a third species. _E_, part of\r\n    _D_, more highly magnified. _F_, developing eggs, two stages.—After\r\n    Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nInsects as a rule instinctively lay their eggs near or upon objects\r\ndestined to be the food of the larva; those of caterpillars on leaves,\r\nthose of many flies on meat or carrion, those of Copris and other\r\ndung-beetles in dung, those of aquatic insects in water, while many\r\noviposit in the earth or in plants (Fig. 482), or in the bodies of\r\nanimals destined to be the hosts of the parasitic larvæ. As the eggs are\r\npreyed upon by mites and other animals, the contrivances and\r\nmodifications of the mode of egg-laying, and the situations in which\r\nthey are placed, are almost endless. Many insects lay their eggs in a\r\nmass, covered with a gummy substance; or those laid in the water, as the\r\neggs of dragon-flies, caddis-flies, Chironomus (Fig. 484), etc., are\r\nenveloped by a jelly-like mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 485.—Egg-capsule of _Periplaneta americana_: _a_, side; _b_, end\r\n    view; _c_, natural size.—After Howard and Marlatt, Bull. 4, Div.\r\n    Ent. U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _oötheca_ of the cockroach (Fig. 485) is a solid, dense case, which,\r\nafter being carried about by the mother, can be left without harm in the\r\ncrevices of the floors of houses. The oötheca of Mantis (Fig. 486) is\r\nformed by a large mass of frothy matter, which hardens and is attached\r\nto stems of plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 486.—Egg-capsules of _Mantis carolina_.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the female “walking-stick” (_Diapheromera\r\n  femoratum_) drops her eggs, says Riley, loosely upon the ground,\r\n  from whatever height she may happen to be, and “one hears a constant\r\n  pattering, not unlike drops of rain, that results from the abundant\r\n  dropping of these eggs, which, in places, lay so thick among and\r\n  under the dead leaves that they may be scraped up in great\r\n  quantities.” (Report for 1879.)\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the lace-winged flies are supported on pedicels, above the\r\nreach of ovivorous mites.\r\n\r\n  The female Chrysopa usually lays between 40 and 50 eggs. In one\r\n  case, we observed that 18 egg-stalks were deposited, but there were\r\n  only nine well-formed eggs in the batch, and nine eggless stalks,\r\n  some only half the usual height, others with the knob of cement at\r\n  the end to which the egg is ordinarily fastened. The eggs are\r\n  evidently stuck on to the end of the pedicel after the latter has\r\n  been formed, as, in one instance, an egg was glued to the stalk very\r\n  much out of centre, the insect’s abdomen not having been aimed\r\n  straight, so to speak, at the mass of cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 487.—Eggs of Chrysopa, with larva and fly.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The eggs of Rhodites are fixed to a long stalk thickened at the end;\r\n  those of Inquilines and certain Chalcids (_Leucospis gigas_, Fig.\r\n  489, _A_) are also stalked; and the use of this stalk in the eggs of\r\n  Cynips (_E_) is thought by Adler to be respiratory, while, also, he\r\n  states that the egg-cavity communicates with the egg-stalk, so that\r\n  a part of the egg-contents can pass into the latter, and this\r\n  happens at the laying of each egg. The egg of certain ichneumons\r\n  (Paniscus, Fig. 488) ends in a short stalk, which is inserted in the\r\n  skin of the caterpillar destined to serve as the host of the\r\n  parasite, the eggs, as stated by De Geer, being retained more firmly\r\n  in the integument by the stalk so swelling as to form two knobs\r\n  (Fig. 498, _c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 488.—Young larva of Paniscus in position of feeding on the skin\r\n    of a caterpillar: _a_, the egg-shell.—After Newport, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Certain Homoptera also have stalked eggs, as those of _Psylla\r\n  pyricola_ (Fig. 489, _B_), those of _Aleyrodes citri_ (_C_, _a_,\r\n  _b_), and of an allied form, _Aleurodicus cocois_ (_D_), and those\r\n  of Corixa (Fig. 493).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 489.—Stalked eggs: _A_, of a Chalcid (after Fabre); _B_, of\r\n    Psylla (after Slingerland); _C_, of Aleyrodes; _D_, of Aleurodicus\r\n    (after Riley and Howard); _E_, of _Dryophanta scutellaris_ (after\r\n    Adler).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 490.—Eggs of ox bot-fly, enlarged.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Reference should also be made to the eggs of lice, which are oval\r\n  and attached to the hairs of their host. Those of the ox bot-fly\r\n  (_Hypoderma lineata_) are usually placed four to six together, and\r\n  fastened to a hair. The lower portion of the egg is admirably\r\n  adapted for clasping a hair. “It consists of two lobes, forming a\r\n  bulbous enlargement, which is attached to the egg by a broad, but\r\n  rather thin, neck, so that, when the latter is viewed sidewise, it\r\n  appears as a slender pedicel” (Fig. 490, _a-d_). (Riley in Insect\r\n  Life, iv, p. 307.) The egg of another fly (_Drosophila ampelophila_,\r\n  Fig. 491) bears a pair of long, slender appendages near the anterior\r\n  end. “The egg is inserted into the soft pulp of the decaying fruit;\r\n  these appendages leave the ovipositor last, and are spread out upon\r\n  the surface of the mass. They, in this way, serve to keep the egg in\r\n  place, and thus insure the emergence of the larva into the open air\r\n  instead of into the more or less fluid mass in which the egg is\r\n  situated. The larva issues from the egg just above the base of these\r\n  appendages.” (Comstock.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 491.—Egg of Drosophila.—After Comstock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Mode of deposition.=—The exact process of oviposition has been rarely\r\nobserved, or at least not observed in detail, and further observations\r\nare much needed. In the cockroach (Phyllodromia), Wheeler has seen the\r\neggs pass out of the oviduct and become arranged in the oötheca, in a\r\nway similar to that in the account published by Kadyi on Periplaneta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 492.—Rocky Mountain locust (_aa_) depositing its eggs (_c_); _d_,\r\n    the earth partially removed, showing (_e_) an egg-mass already in\r\n    place, and (_d_) one being placed; _f_ shows where such a mass has\r\n    been covered over. _A_, oviposition; _j_, position of oviduct; _g_,\r\n    egg-guide; _e_, egg. _B_, egg-mass of the same; _a_, from side, _b_,\r\n    from beneath, _c_, from above.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “When about to form the capsule, the female Blatta closes the\r\n  genital armature, and the two folds of the white membrane which\r\n  lines the oöthecal cavity close vertically in the middle line. Then\r\n  some of the contents of the colleterial glands are poured into the\r\n  chamber, and bathe the inner surface of the posterior wall. The\r\n  first egg glides down the vagina from the left ovary, describes an\r\n  arc, still keeping its germarium-pole uppermost, after having\r\n  pressed the micropylar area against the mouth of the spermatheca,\r\n  passes to the right side of the back of the chamber, and is placed\r\n  perpendicularly two-thirds to the right of the longitudinal axis of\r\n  the insect’s body. The next egg comes from the right ovary,\r\n  describes an arc to the opposite side of the body, decussating with\r\n  the path of the first egg, and is placed completely on the left side\r\n  of the median line. The third egg comes from the left ovary, and is\r\n  made to lie completely on the right side of the median line; and so\r\n  the process continues, the ovaries discharging the eggs alternately,\r\n  and each egg describing an arc to the opposite side of the capsule.\r\n  The oöthecal chamber soon becomes too small to contain all the\r\n  constantly accumulating eggs, so the anal armature opens and allows\r\n  the end of the capsule to project. A raised line, the impression of\r\n  the edges of the white membrane, runs down the end of the capsule.\r\n  The last egg deposited comes from the right ovary, and lies\r\n  two-thirds on the left, and one-third to the right, of the median\r\n  line. As soon as the egg is laid, a further discharge from the\r\n  colleterial glands spreads over the vaginal or anterior wall of the\r\n  cavity, and becomes evenly continuous with the secretion which has\r\n  before been spread over the back and the sides of the capsule by the\r\n  white membrane.\r\n\r\n  “The crista, a cord-like ridge running the full length of the dorsal\r\n  surface of the capsule, is a thick-walled tube, either half of which\r\n  is formed by the edge of the side walls of the capsule split into\r\n  two laminæ. The rhythmical clasping of the three pairs of palpi\r\n  which guard the vaginal opening is registered in an exquisite\r\n  pattern on the inner face of either half of the crista.”[78]\r\n\r\nThe mode of oviposition in the locust has been fully described by Riley,\r\nwho states that the eggs pass down and out of the oviduct, and “guided\r\nby a little finger-like style” (Fig. 298), they pass in between the\r\nhorny valves of the ovipositor, and issue at their tips amid the mucous\r\nfluid which forms the egg-capsule (Fig. 492).\r\n\r\n=Vitality of eggs.=—It is well known that the eggs of phyllopod and\r\nother fresh-water Crustacea have wonderful vitality, withstanding\r\nextreme dryness for several years, at least from two to ten. Such cases\r\nare unknown among insects. It has been observed, however, by T. W.\r\nBrigham, and also by L. Trouvelot, that the eggs of the walking-stick\r\n(_Diapheromera femorata_) for the most part hatch only after the\r\ninterval of two years.[79]\r\n\r\nThe eggs of Bittacus are said by Brauer to lie over unhatched for two\r\nyears; indeed, the first condition of their hatching is a complete\r\ndrying of the earth in which the eggs lie, the second is a succeeding\r\nthorough wetting of the ground in spring.\r\n\r\n_Appearance and structure of the ripe egg._—The eggs of insects are on\r\nthe whole rather large in proportion to the size of the parent,\r\nespecially so in many minute forms, as the fleas, lice, etc.\r\n\r\nTheir general shape is spherical or oval, often cylindrical; where the\r\neggs are long and cylindrical a dorsal and ventral side can be\r\ndistinguished (Fig. 502). They are in the Tortricidæ and Limacodid moths\r\nflattened, thin, and scale-like. In the eggs of locusts and\r\ngrasshoppers, as well as certain Diptera, the ventral side of the embryo\r\ncorresponds to the convex side, and the concave side of the egg to the\r\ndorsal region of the embryo (Figs. 502 and 493).\r\n\r\nThere is an anterior and posterior end or pole, the anterior end being\r\nthat which in the body of the parent lies towards her head, or towards\r\nthe upper or distal end of the ovarian tube. Towards this end lies in\r\nthe later stages of embryonic life the head-end of the embryo, while the\r\nposterior end of the embryo is turned towards the hinder pole of the egg\r\n(Figs. 493 and 520).\r\n\r\n=The egg-shell and yolk-membrane.=—The ripe egg is protected by two\r\nmembranes: 1, an inner or _vitelline membrane_ or _oölemma_ (_dh_) (Fig.\r\n500, _d_), produced in the egg by a hardening of the outer layer, and 2,\r\nthe outer or _chorion_ (_c_), which is secreted by the cells of the\r\novarian follicle. The latter is divided into two layers: an inner, the\r\n_endochorion_, and an outer, the _exochorion_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 503.—Fertilization of the egg of a round-worm (_Ascaris\r\n    megalocephala_): _A_, the ends (centrosomes) of the spindle formed.\r\n    _B_, the spindle completed; _sp_, sperm-nucleus, with its\r\n    chromosomes; _ei_, egg-nucleus; _p_, polar bodies.—After Boveri,\r\n    from Field’s Hertwig.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 493.—Eggs of Corixa: _A_, early stage before formation of the\r\n    embryo, from one side. _B_, the same viewed in the plane of\r\n    symmetry. _C_, the embryo in its final position; _a_, anterior, _p_,\r\n    posterior, end; _l_, left, _r_, right, _v_, ventral, _d_, dorsal,\r\n    aspect.

These external markings are due\r\nto the impress of the cellular structure of the epithelium of the\r\novarian follicle.\r\n\r\nIn the chorion of the cockroach the surface appears to be finely\r\ngranular, the finest granules being arranged in large, more or less\r\nregularly hexagonal areas, which are bounded by narrow, dark spaces,\r\ncontaining somewhat larger though less dense granules. The surface of\r\nthe eggs of certain Phasmids are variously sculptured (Fig. 494).\r\n\r\n  The true structure of the chorion can only be, as Wheeler observes,\r\n  seen in cross-sections, as shown by Blochmann, and also by Wheeler.\r\n  The chorion consists of two chitinous laminæ kept in close\r\n  apposition by means of numerous minute trabeculæ or pillars. It is\r\n  the ends of these pillars that look like granules. In the spaces\r\n  between the hexagonal areas, the trabeculæ are more scattered and\r\n  individually thicker than those of the hexagons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 495.—Egg of cotton-worm moth, Aletia: _a_, top view, showing the\r\n    micropyle.—After Comstock.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 496.—Egg of _Danais archippus_.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese markings are of singular beauty and complexity in the eggs of many\r\nLepidoptera, whose ova are variously ribbed, forming a beautiful\r\nfretwork of raised lines (Figs. 495 and 496), while in the Diptera and\r\nHymenoptera the chorion is less solid, and usually smooth under low\r\npowers. The exochorion of the egg of the house and meat fly (_C.\r\nvomitoria_) is pitted with elongated hexagonal depressions, which cross\r\nthe egg transversely. That of the honey-bee is also divided into long\r\nhexagonal areas (Fig. 497).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 497.—Egg with embryo of honey-bee, × 40: _ch_, chorion; _ga_,\r\n    ganglia; _s. ga_, brain; _jm_, jaw-muscles forming; _c_, œsophageal\r\n    collar; _fb_, fore intestine; _mb_, mid-intestine; _ab_,\r\n    hind-intestine.—After Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 498.—Micropyle (_Mk_) of eggs; _a_, of a fly, Antomyia; _b_,\r\n    _Drosophila cellaris_; _c_, stalked egg of _Paniscus\r\n    testaceus_.—After Leuckart, from Perrier.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are deposited in exposed places, and remain in such\r\nsituations for several days, or weeks, or even through the winter, the\r\nshell is either solid and strengthened by the ribs and ridges; or the\r\nshell, if of winter eggs, is unornamented, and is dense and solid, to\r\nresist extremes in temperature or the attacks of egg-eating birds,\r\nmites, etc.\r\n\r\n=The micropyle.=—This is an opening or canal, or, as in most insects, a\r\ngroup of canals situated at the anterior end of the egg for the entrance\r\nof the spermatozoa during the process of fertilization of the ovum (Fig.\r\n498). In Acrydians, however, the micropyle is situated at the posterior\r\nend of the egg. The micropyle (Fig. 499) is a complicated apparatus\r\nwithin whose circumference the vitelline membrane appears to be firmly\r\nattached to the chorion, so that the perforation passes through the\r\nchorion as well as the yolk-membrane.\r\n\r\nThe micropyles of the cockroach are probably as simple and generalized\r\nas in any insect. Wheeler states that they are in Phyllodromia scattered\r\nover the end of the egg, “over a quadrant of the upper hemisphere, where\r\nthe beautiful hexagonal pattern of the chorion gives away to an even\r\ntrabeculation.” The micropyles are wide-mouthed, very oblique,\r\nfunnel-shaped canals, perforating the chorion, the apertures of the\r\nfunnels appearing under a low power as clear, oval spots, the long axis\r\nof which is parallel to the long axis of the egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 499.—_a_, fragment of a micropylar papilla, showing its lumen;\r\n    _b_, optical section of another papilla, in this one the lumen\r\n    extends to the vitelline membrane, but does not pass beyond it; _c_,\r\n    _d_, _e_, and _f_, papillæ of different forms. _A_, anterior end of\r\n    an ovarian egg, showing mode of growth of the micropylar papillæ:\r\n    _a_, _b_, two successive stages; _c_, surface view of modified\r\n    papillæ from the lower edges of the cap; _d_, tunica propria of the\r\n    ovariole; _e_, remnant of the cell-mass that secreted (?) the\r\n    micropylar cap.—After Ayers.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 500.—Egg of _Perla maxima_: _c_, chorion; _d_, oölemma; _gs_,\r\n    glass-like covering of micropyle; _l_, cavity under same; _g_,\r\n    canals penetrating chorion.—After Imhof, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “With a higher power the tube of each funnel is clearly visible as a\r\n  thin canal which dilates rapidly into the large oval aperture on the\r\n  outer face of the chorion. The narrow tube is sometimes fully as\r\n  long as the large orifice. The micropylar perforations are all\r\n  directed from the germarium to the vaginal pole of the egg. Hence a\r\n  line, the hypothetical path of the spermatozoön, drawn through one\r\n  of these oblique micropyles, and continued into the egg, would\r\n  strike the equatorial plane. The female pronucleus, as we shall see\r\n  further on, moves in this plane.” (Wheeler, p. 289.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 501.—Micropyles: _a_, of _Nepa cinerea_; _b_, of _Locusta\r\n    viridissima_; _c_, of a bug (_Pyrrhocoris apterus_).—From\r\n    Gerstäcker.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe micropylar region is generally, at least in Orthoptera and Odonata,\r\ncovered by a gelatinous cap (Figs. 499 and 500, _gs_), which may form a\r\ncovering membrane which extends over a large part of the egg, or may\r\nenvelop the entire outer surface. In some cases micropyles are scattered\r\nover the entire surface of the egg, but usually the perforation is\r\nsituated at the end, and is often guarded by raised processes, either\r\none or several, like bristles, or toadstools, etc., these being\r\nespecially characteristic of the eggs of certain Hemiptera (Nepa, Fig.\r\n501, _a_, and Ranatra), or the region is variously sculptured, as in the\r\neggs of butterflies. In the micropylar apparatus of Œcanthus the papillæ\r\nhave a distinct lumen (Fig. 499), or a channel for the ingress of the\r\nmale filament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 502.—Diagrammatic median section through egg of Musca in stage of\r\n    fertilization (incorporating the figures of Henking and Blochmann):\r\n    _ch_, chorion; _d_, dorsal; _v_, ventral side of the egg; _dh_,\r\n    yolk-membrane; _do_, nutritive yolk; _g_, gelatinous cap over the\r\n    micropyle (_m_); _K_, outer layer of plasma (Keimhautblastem); _p_,\r\n    male and female pronucleus before copulation; _r_, directive body\r\n    (Richtungskörper).—After Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother use of the micropylar apparatus noticed by Ayers in the egg of\r\nthe tree-cricket is that it “serves as a thick, roughened plate, against\r\nwhich the insect may push when ovipositing, without injury to the egg,\r\nand without danger that the ovipositor slips from its place.” In\r\nChrysopa eggs the micropyle forms a conspicuous button-like knob,\r\nresembling the finely milled head of a certain kind of screw.\r\n\r\n=Internal structure of the egg.=—The egg-contents are surrounded by an\r\nouter layer of protoplasm or formative yolk, which is separate from the\r\ninner parts of the egg (Fig. 502, _do_), the latter being mostly\r\ncomposed of the nutritive yolk-element. The superficial protoplasmic\r\nlayer, called by Weismann _Keimhautblastem_ (_K_) is, in a few cases,\r\nafterwards entirely lost, but in most instances forms a very thin layer\r\nof clear protoplasm, slight in extent compared with the yolk-mass\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of insects are rich in yolk, only certain eggs, such as those\r\nof the Aphides and the egg parasites (Proctotrypidæ) being poor in yolk.\r\nThe eggs of heterometabolous insects have been said by Brauer to contain\r\nrelatively more yolk than those of the Metabola, particularly the\r\nDiptera; though, as Wheeler observes, this rule has some exceptions, the\r\neggs of the 17–year Cicada being very numerous and small.\r\n\r\n  This he thinks is a greater advantage to the insect than the\r\n  production of a few large eggs, “when we consider the extremely long\r\n  period of larval life and the vicissitudes to which the larvæ may be\r\n  subjected during all this time.” “Similarly, _Meloë angusticollis_\r\n  produces a large number of very small eggs, while the eggs of the\r\n  smaller beetles (Doryphora, _e.g._) are much larger. But Meloë is a\r\n  parasitic form, and probably only a few of its many offspring ever\r\n  succeed in gaining access to the egg of the bee.”\r\n\r\nIn the eggs of Chrysopa the yolk-granules are remarkably small, so that\r\nthe primitive band is in strong contrast to the yolk in color and\r\ndensity. When crushed, the yolk does not flow out as a liquid, but in a\r\npasty mass, and we have questioned whether, as in the eggs of Limulus,\r\nwhose yolk is solid with fine granules, the denseness of the yolk is not\r\nconnected in the way of cause and effect with their exposed situation.\r\n\r\nThe central or yolk-mass (Fig. 502, _do_) consists chiefly of rounded\r\nmasses of yolk, with fat-globules, between which extends a fine network\r\nof protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the yolk are spherical and strongly refractive, by\r\npressure becoming polygonal structureless homogeneous bodies.\r\n\r\nThe germinal vesicle of the ripe insect-egg lies in the centre of the\r\nyolk, where it appears as a large vesicle-like cell-nucleus containing a\r\nfew chromatin elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _b._ Maturation or ripening of the egg\r\n\r\nBefore the eggs of animals can be fertilized, they require in some\r\nobserved cases, and probably in animals in general, to undergo a series\r\nof changes, which, as observed in the starfish, etc., consists in the\r\nreplacement of the germinal vesicle by a very much smaller egg-nucleus,\r\nand also at the same time the construction at one pole of the egg of the\r\ndirective or polar bodies (Fig. 502, _r_). Towards the end of the\r\nripening process of the insect egg this vesicle, according to Blochmann,\r\npasses to the dorsal surface of the egg, and is transformed into the\r\ndirective spindles (_Richtungspindel_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _c._ Fertilization of the egg\r\n\r\nThe egg next requires the penetration and admission into the\r\nyolk-interior of a spermatozoön.\r\n\r\nThis process is essentially in insects, as in other animals, the fusion\r\nof the sperm-nucleus with the nucleus of the egg. Under normal\r\nconditions but a single spermatozoön is required for fertilization. As\r\nshown by Hertwig, in the sea-urchin, after the spermatozoön has\r\npenetrated into the egg, the head, and the small rounded body, called a\r\n_centrosome_, can still be recognized, but the tail becomes fused with\r\nthe yolk of the egg. In the protoplasm of the egg (called _cytoplasm_)\r\nthe achromatic end of the sperm-nucleus gives rise to conspicuous rays,\r\nlike those observed in ordinary cell-division. Preceded by these rays,\r\nthe sperm-nucleus or male pronucleus (Fig. 502, _p_) moves towards the\r\nnucleus of the egg, and finally fuses with it, thus forming a new single\r\nnucleus. This latter, which is called “the cleavage nucleus,” rapidly\r\nforms a nuclear or “cleavage spindle” (Fig. 503). This act gives an\r\nimpulse to the cleavage of the egg, which is the first step in the\r\nformation of the embryo. All these changes have yet to be worked out in\r\ndetail in insects by microscopic sections of the egg, whose generally\r\nhard and opaque egg-shells present great obstacles to such work.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _d._ Division and formation of the blastoderm[80]\r\n\r\nIn insects as in most other Arthropoda the segmentation of the yolk is\r\nsuperficial and not total. The ovum is _centrolicithal_, _i.e._ the yolk\r\nis concentrated at the centre of the egg, and surrounded by a peripheral\r\nlayer of transparent protoplasm (the _Keimhautblastem_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 504.—Formation of the blastoderm of _Pieris cratægi_: _A_,\r\n    longitudinal section through the egg, with two masses of protoplasm\r\n    in the yolk. _B_, a blastoderm-cell at the upper end. _C_, a later\r\n    stage, with more blastoderm-cells.—After Bobretsky.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first step in segmentation is the movement of the first\r\ndivision-nucleus (_i.e._ that in the fertilized egg arising from the\r\nunion of the sperm-nucleus with the female pronucleus) towards the\r\ninterior of the egg in order to multiply itself by the mode of indirect\r\nnuclear division (Figs. 504, _A_, and 507).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 505.—Embryology of the mole-cricket: 1, egg in which the amœboid\r\n    nuclei (_abc_) are moving toward the surface; 2, egg in which the\r\n    nuclei (_abc_) have reached the surface, and show an active\r\n    nucleus-formation; 3, the blastoderm-cells have no nucleus, and are\r\n    placed at equal distances apart; 4, the blastoderm-cells now forming\r\n    a continuous layer; 5, cross-section of the egg with blastodermic\r\n    disk, also showing the disposition of the endodermal cells; 6,\r\n    cross-section of the blastodermic disk, with the myoblast cells\r\n    (_mb_) already formed; 7, cross-section through the thorax of the\r\n    embryo, the body-cavity extended into the limbs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                               LETTERING.\r\n\r\n _abc_,     amœboid blastodermic cells.\r\n\r\n _bc_,      blastoderm-cells.\r\n\r\n _bl_,      blastoderm.\r\n\r\n _en_,      endodermal cells.\r\n\r\n _M″_,      cavity of the myoblast.\r\n\r\n _mb_,      myoblast cells.\r\n\r\n _N_,       nerve-furrow.\r\n\r\n _P_,       primitive groove.\r\n\r\n _pd_,      primitive disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 505 _concluded_.—Later stages in the embryology of the\r\n    mole-cricket: 8, longitudinal section of the embryo; the\r\n    yolk-pyramids (_yp_) form a common inner yolk-mass (_y_). 9, section\r\n    through the heart; _H_, cavity of the heart; the two halves of the\r\n    heart-sinuses having united dorsally, ventrally they are still open\r\n    and are bounded by the walls of the mesenteron. 10, cross-section of\r\n    an embryo, showing the blood-lacunæ separated on the back by the\r\n    dorsal organ (_do_); the intestinal fasciated layer\r\n    (_Darmfaserblatt_) has not completely enclosed the yolk. 11, embryo\r\n    completely segmented, with the rudiments of the appendages, labrum\r\n    (_lab_), and nervous ganglia (_pc-ng_). 12, a more advanced embryo,\r\n    showing the stomodæum (_st_) indicated as a frontal protuberance.\r\n    13, section through the recently hatched larva, showing the cells of\r\n    the mesenteron or chyle-stomach, and the cellular layer on the front\r\n    surface, also the proventriculus or crop.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                               LETTERING.\r\n\r\n _ant_,     antenna.\r\n\r\n _ar_,      arterial sinus.\r\n\r\n _bl_,      blastoderm.\r\n\r\n _bla_,     abdominal vesicles.\r\n\r\n _cr_,      proventriculus, or crop.\r\n\r\n _dm_,      ventral diaphragm.\r\n\r\n _do_,      dorsal organ.\r\n\r\n _d pm_,    dorsal diaphragm.\r\n\r\n _ent_,     enteric layer.\r\n\r\n _f_,       fat-body.\r\n\r\n _g_,       ventral ganglion.\r\n\r\n _H_, _ht_, heart.\r\n\r\n _l_,       lacuna.\r\n\r\n _m_,       mouth.\r\n\r\n _md_,      mandible.\r\n\r\n _m.en_,    mesenteron.\r\n\r\n _mx′_,     1st maxilla.\r\n\r\n _mx″_,     labium, or 2d maxilla.\r\n\r\n _ml_,      leaf-like portion of mesenteron.\r\n\r\n _oe_,      œsophagus.\r\n\r\n _pc_,      procerebrum.\r\n\r\n _pm_,      proctodæum.\r\n\r\n _sg_,      subœsophageal ganglion.\r\n\r\n _sm_,      stomodæum.\r\n\r\n _tg_,      thoracic ganglion.\r\n\r\n _vm_,      ventral muscle.\r\n\r\n _y_,       yolk.\r\n\r\n _yp_,      yolk-pyramids.\r\n\r\n _I_,       1st pair of feet.\r\n\r\n _II_,      2d pair of feet.\r\n\r\n _III_,     3d pair of feet.\r\n\r\n                           —After Korotneff.\r\n\r\nThe origin of numerous division-nuclei as the offspring of the first has\r\nbeen observed to take place in the eggs of those insects (Aphides,\r\nCecidomyia, and Cynips) which have a slight amount of yolk. Yet in the\r\nlarge, ordinary eggs of insects with an abundance of yolk there is no\r\ndoubt, say Korschelt and Heider, that these numerous division-nuclei,\r\nwhich soon after the process of oviposition are scattered within the egg\r\nbetween the yolk-spheres, and are enveloped by a star-shaped\r\nprotoplasmic layer, and which constitute the formative elements of the\r\nblastoderm,—there is no doubt but that they have practically arisen\r\nthrough indirect nuclear division from the first division-nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe process of formation of the blastoderm in ordinary eggs with\r\nabundant yolk was first observed by Bobretsky in the eggs of a moth\r\n(Porthesia) and Pieris, also by Graber, and more recently by Blochmann\r\nin Musca, and by Heider in Hydrophilus.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stage observed by Bobretsky there first appear after\r\nfertilization a few (the smallest number four) cell-like, minute amœboid\r\nmasses of protoplasm, each with a distinct nucleus. A few (one at least)\r\nof these bodies gradually pass out of the centre of the yolk to the\r\nsurface of the egg (Fig. 504, _A_, _n_), these becoming larger and\r\nrounder, and from one or two of these nuclei (_B_, _bc_) the blastoderm\r\noriginates (_C_, _bl_). Those nuclei remaining in the yolk increase in\r\nnumber and afterwards become the nuclei of rounded masses of\r\nyolk-granules, forming the so-called yolk-spheres which Bobretsky\r\nregards as true cells.\r\n\r\nTo the few blastoderm cells situated on the upper end of the egg are\r\nadded others which continue to pass from the yolk to the periphery, and\r\nthen the blastoderm spreads out farther and farther from the upper end\r\nof the egg until finally it covers or envelops the whole yolk. This\r\nlayer of cells is called the _blastoderm_.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the primitive amœboid cells, Bobretsky is in doubt,\r\nbut is disposed to think that they are the result of the subdivision of\r\nthe germinative vesicle or nucleus of the ovarian egg-cell. In this\r\nconnection may be quoted the observations of Graber, who states that an\r\nexamination of the ovarian cell at an early period has revealed the\r\npresence, in the centre of the yolk, of a number of amœboid cells, which\r\nappear to have been formed by the division of the germinal vesicle.\r\nThese “primary embryonic cells” have a relatively large nucleus and a\r\nnumber of nucleoli. Several may be seen to unite with one another by\r\nmeans of their pseudopodia, and they may also be observed to undergo\r\ndivision. With this account may be compared the results obtained by\r\nKorotneff in his work on the embryology of the mole-cricket (Fig. 505).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 506.—Four successive stages in the formation of the blastoderm of\r\n    _Calliphora vomitoria_ (the figures represent segments of\r\n    cross-sections through the fly’s egg): _A_, the nuclei of the\r\n    division-cells have arranged themselves parallel with the outer\r\n    surface of the egg. _B_, the division-cells fused with the\r\n    “keimhautblastem.” _C_, the outer surface becomes furrowed by\r\n    indentations; all the nuclei of the blastoderm-cells in process of\r\n    division. _D_, the blastoderm-cells form a high cylinder-epithelium:\r\n    _b_, “keimhautblastem”; _bz_, blastoderm-cells; _d_, nutritive yolk;\r\n    _dz_, yolk-cell; _fz_, so-called division-cell; _i_, inner\r\n    “keimhautblastem.”—After Blochmann, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe result of these and of later observations, especially those of\r\nBlochmann on Musca, and those of Heider on Hydrophilus, show that the\r\ndivision-nuclei lie near the centre of the egg, along the longitudinal\r\naxis (Fig. 507, _A_). Each of these nuclei is enveloped by a star-shaped\r\nmass of protoplasm, and on the whole resembles a wandering amœboid cell.\r\nThese isolated masses of protoplasm are all connected by a fine network\r\nof rays, which unite to form within the yolk a syncytium. Afterwards, in\r\nthe later stages, these division-cells, as they may be, though somewhat\r\nincorrectly, regarded, move nearer the periphery and arrange themselves\r\ninto a plane parallel with the surface (Figs. 506, _A_, 507, _B_).\r\nContinuing to divide, they reach the surface and fuse with the\r\nperipheral protoplasmic layer (Figs. 506, _B_, 507, _C_). Then follows\r\nthe division into single cell-territories (Figs. 506, _B_, 507, _C_),\r\ncorresponding to the division-nuclei, through the appearance of furrows\r\nwhich pass in from the outer surfaces of the egg into the interior and\r\ngradually penetrate the entire “keimhautblastem.” In this way the\r\nsurface of the egg is covered with an epithelium (blastoderm). In many\r\ninsects the so-called inner “keimhautblastem” (Fig. 506, _D_, _i_) is\r\nformed by the separation of a layer of protoplasm which contains larger\r\ngranules and are accumulated between the blastoderm and the upper\r\nsurface of the central nutritive yolk-mass. By the addition of this\r\nplasmic layer the cells of the blastoderm increase in height, and now\r\nform a cubical or cylinder epithelium, which continuously envelops the\r\nsurface of the egg.

While the amnion-folds are extending from all sides over\r\nthe primitive band, there becomes formed under it, by the invagination\r\nof the outer surface of the egg, a cavity, the amnion-cavity (_ah_),\r\nwhich, when the amnion-fold has completely overgrown the primitive band\r\nand united together (Fig. 509, _C_), appears completely closed from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 508.—Two schematic median sections through an insect-embryo to\r\n    represent the development of the embryonal membranes.

The primitive band is seen after its completion\r\nto be overgrown by a double cellular epithelial membrane. The outer of\r\nthese two membranes, that which arises from the outer leaf or layer of\r\nthe amnion-fold, is the _serosa_ (Figs. 508, _B_; 509, _C_, _s_; 510).\r\nThis passes continuously into the unchanged part of the blastoderm,\r\nwhich has no part in the formation of the primitive band and\r\ngerm-layers, and which covers the outer surface of the yolk. Thus the\r\n_serosa_, which is usually held to include this portion also of the\r\nblastoderm, forms a closed sac which covers the whole surface of the\r\negg, with one part extending over the surface of the yolk, and the other\r\nover the primitive band (Fig. 510).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 509.—Diagrammatic cross-section through three successive stages\r\n    of the primitive streak, and growing embryonal membranes of\r\n    insect-embryos. _A_, formation of the ventral plate and of the\r\n    gastrula invagination (_g_). _B_, upward growth of the amnion-folds\r\n    (_af_). _C_, complete overgrowth of the primitive band through the\r\n    amnion-folds: _v_, ventral side; _d_, dorsal side; _af_,\r\n    amnion-folds; _ah_, amnion-cavity; _am_, amnion; _bl_, blastoderm;\r\n    _bp_, ventral plate; _do_, yolk; _ec_, ectoderm; _s_, serosa; _u_,\r\n    under or inner layer.—After Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inner of the two layers, called the _amnion_ (Fig. 509, _am_), is\r\nmore closely connected with the embryo. The amnion and ectoderm of the\r\nprimitive band together form a completely closed sac, whose lumen forms\r\nthe amniotic cavity. Originally connected with the serous membrane, it\r\nsplits off from the primitive band about the time the appendages begin\r\nto bud out, and continues to closely envelop the body and appendages, as\r\nseen in Fig. 509. Both of these membranes are, before the time of\r\nhatching, either absorbed, or, as in Lepidoptera, retained. The amnion\r\nis retained until after hatching in the locust, etc. In certain\r\nColeoptera the serosa is retained, and the amnion is absorbed (Fig.\r\n532), while in Chironomus and the Trichoptera the serosa is absorbed,\r\nand the amnion retained, with the egg-shell or chorion. Hence we have\r\neight layers in the winged insects[81] during embryonic life:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 510.—Surface view of fresh serosa from an Œcanthus, treated with\r\n    acetic carmine; the blastoderm completely formed, × 500: _p_, polar\r\n    body; _rf_, radiating fibres; _nls_, nuclear substance; _nlm_,\r\n    nuclear membrane.—After Ayers.\r\n]\r\n\r\n     1.

The chorion. 2. The blastoderm-skin-like cuticle secreted by\r\n        the serosa. 3. The serosa. 4. The outer indusium. 5. A layer\r\n        of dark granular secretion (probably some urate). 6. The\r\n        cuticle secreted by the inner indusium. 7. The inner indusium.\r\n        8. The amnion. While envelopes 1–7 invest the whole egg; layer\r\n        8, the amnion, covers only the embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 511.—Diagrams illustrating the movements and envelopes of the\r\n    embryo of Xiphidium: _A_, after the closure of the amnioserosal\r\n    folds. _B_, during the embryo’s passage to the dorsal surface.\r\n    _C_, just after the straightening of the embryo on the dorsal\r\n    surface; _ind_, indusium afterwards forming _ind^1_, the inner,\r\n    and _ind^2_, the outer indusium; _ch_, chorion; _sr_, serosa;\r\n    _am_, amnion; _gb_, germ-band; _v_, yolk; _bl. c_, blastoderm\r\n    membrane.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Wheeler further suggests that the so-called micropyle of the\r\n  Collembola (Anurida), which has been homologized with the “dorsal\r\n  organ” of Crustacea, is a possible homologue of the indusium, as\r\n  also the “primitive cumulus” of spiders, and the “facette” or\r\n  “cervical cross” of Pentastomids described by Leuckart and also by\r\n  Stiles.\r\n\r\n=The gastrula stage.=—The primitive band invaginates so as to give the\r\nopportunity for the formation of the inner layer. This invagination,\r\nwhich at a certain stage is established along the whole length of the\r\nprimitive band, forms a median furrow and may be regarded as the\r\ngastrula-invagination of insects. The lower (inner) layer thus arising\r\nafterwards spreads out under the entire primitive band (Fig. 509, _B_\r\nand _C_), the edges of which become bordered by the growing amnion-fold.\r\n(Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  In certain forms the primitive band arises from several separate\r\n  rudiments which afterwards unite. Thus in Musca and Hydrophilus the\r\n  anterior and posterior ends develop first, and in Hydrophilus the\r\n  procephalic lobes originate independently of the rest of the band.\r\n  In the Aphides, also, according to Will, these lobes arise\r\n  independently, afterwards uniting with the primitive band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 512.—Diagrams illustrating the movements and envelopes of the\r\n    embryo of Xiphidium: _D_, the stage of the shortened embryo on the\r\n    the dorsal yolk. _E_, embryo returning to the ventral surface. _F_,\r\n    embryo nearly ready to hatch; _ch_, chorion; _b. lc_, blastoderm\r\n    membrane; _sr_, serosa; _ind^1_, outer indusium; _ind^2_, inner\r\n    indusium; _ind^2 + am_, inner indusium and amnion fused; _am_,\r\n    amnion; _ind^1 c_, cuticle of the inner indusium; _ind^2 s_,\r\n    granular secretion of the inner indusium; _am. s_, amniotic\r\n    secretion; _v_, yolk; _cl_, columella; _gb_, primitive band.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Division of the embryo or primitive band into body-segments.=—Meanwhile\r\nthe primitive band grows at the expense of the yolk, spreading out more\r\nand more over its surface, until in certain cases (Coleoptera, Diptera,\r\nSiphonaptera, and Trichoptera) it lies like a broad ribbon over the\r\nyolk, so that the two ends nearly meet on the dorsal side. By this time\r\nit becomes divided by transversely impressed lines into segments, which\r\ncorrespond to those of the larva and adult. The first of these segments\r\nis divided into two broad and flaring flaps, which are called the\r\nprocephalic lobes. It becomes the antennal segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 513.—Two stages in the spreading of the indusium. _A_, lateral\r\n    view of egg just after the arrival of the embryo on the dorsal yolk.\r\n    _B_, lateral view of the egg with the indusium nearly reaching the\r\n    poles. _C_, same egg seen from the dorsal surface.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mouth (_stomodæum_) now develops, and is situated at the\r\nanterior,[82] and the rectum (_proctodæum_,) at the posterior pole, or\r\nend of the primitive band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 514.—Median section of the egg of _Anurida maritima_: _do_,\r\n    “micropyle”; _bld_, blastoderm.—This and Figs. 511–513, after\r\n    Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Blatta, Hydrophilus, the Trichoptera, and the Lepidoptera the\r\nhindermost part of the primitive band is turned in ventrally (Figs. 534,\r\n_C_).\r\n\r\n  The preceding account of the relations of the primitive band to the\r\n  yolk does not apply to all insects, since there are variations which\r\n  appear to depend on the form of the egg, and on the amount and\r\n  distribution of the yolk-masses. In certain Coleoptera, the\r\n  primitive band sinks down and thus becomes immersed into the yolk.\r\n  In Donacia (Kölliker and Melnikow) and Hydrophilus (Heider), and in\r\n  the Chrysomelidæ and Attelabus, a weevil, as we have observed, the\r\n  primitive band rests on the outside of the yolk, but in _Telephorus\r\n  fraxini_ it is immersed. In the Hemiptera it is immersed (Fig. 516),\r\n  but there is much variation in this respect, the degree of immersion\r\n  being most marked in the Coccidæ (Aspidiotus), and least so in\r\n  Corixa. Besides the position of the primitive band, there are in\r\n  Odonata and Hemiptera differences in the origin of the primitive\r\n  band itself and of the embryonic membranes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 515.—Ventral view of five developmental stages of Hydrophilus:\r\n    _a_ and _b_, places at which the blastopore contracts; _af_, edge\r\n    of the amnion-fold; _af′_, caudal fold; _af″_, paired head-fold of\r\n    the amnion; _an_, antenna; _es_, last segment; _g_, pit-like\r\n    invagination (first indication of the amniotic cavity); _k_,\r\n    head-lobes; _r_, furrow-like invagination; _s_, portion of the\r\n    primitive streak covered by the amnion.—After Heider, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 516.—Embryo of the louse: _am_, serosa; _db_, amnion; _as_,\r\n    antenna; _vk_, clypeus.—After Melnikow.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Korschelt and Heider divide the early embryo of insects into two\r\n  types:\r\n\r\n  1. Into those with a superficial primitive band; viz., where there\r\n  is no passage of yolk-elements into the space between the amnion and\r\n  serosa. The primitive band has in such cases a relatively\r\n  superficial position (Figs. 508, 509, 521, 535). Examples are\r\n  certain Orthoptera (Blatta, Œcanthus, Mantis, Gryllotalpa), also\r\n  certain Hemiptera (Corixa), certain Coleoptera, and the Trichoptera,\r\n  Diptera, and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  2. Into those with an immersed primitive band, with the space\r\n  between the serosa and amnion filled with yolk (Figs. 517, 518,\r\n  534). Examples are the orthopterous Stenobothrus, Odonata, many\r\n  Hemiptera (the Pediculina and Pyrrhocoris), the Coleoptera already\r\n  mentioned, and Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  It should be observed, however, that these differences are of little\r\n  phylogenetic or taxonomic value, since genera of the same order,\r\n  notably the Coleoptera, differ as to the position of the primitive\r\n  band, so also two orders so nearly allied as the Trichoptera and\r\n  Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  =Differences between the invaginated and overgrown primitive\r\n  band.=—In respect to the mode of origin of the primitive band and\r\n  its relative position, there are two opposite types, though\r\n  connected by transitional forms. In the one case the primitive band,\r\n  _i.e._ its ventral portion, the “ventral plate” (Fig. 518, _b_, _p_)\r\n  is pushed in or invaginated in the interior of the egg; in the other\r\n  case it becomes overgrown by the folds of the amnion arising from\r\n  its edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 517.—Primitive streak of a lepidopter in cross-section: _ah_,\r\n    amniotic cavity; _am_, amnion; _c_, cœlomic cavity; _do_,\r\n    nutritive yolk, divided into single nucleated masses; _ec_,\r\n    ectoderm; _m_, mesoderm; _pr_, primitive thickenings of the\r\n    ventral nervous cord; _s_, serosa.—Combined figure after those of\r\n    Brobretsky and Hatschek, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 518.—Five diagrammatic median sections representing the growth\r\n    of a dragon-fly (Calopteryx). _A-C_, development of the primitive\r\n    streak (_k_, _k′_) by invagination. _D_, the amnion-fold (_af_),\r\n    growing over the head-end of the primitive streak. _E_, closing of\r\n    the opening of the amnion-cavity (_ah_): _v_, ventral, _d_, dorsal\r\n    side; _a_, fore, _b_, hind end of egg; _bl_, blastoderm; _bp_,\r\n    ventral plate; _do_, yolk; _k_, head-end, _k′_, caudal end, of the\r\n    primitive streak; _kh_, germinal thickening or initial point of\r\n    invagination; _s_, serosa.—After Brandt, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In insects with an overgrown primitive band, the band at the\r\n  beginning is generally short and always situated on the ventral side\r\n  of the egg, with the head-end looking forward, and remains in this\r\n  position throughout embryonic life. There is no revolution of the\r\n  embryo. The embryonal membranes arise through the formation of\r\n  folds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 519.—Three embryonic stages of Calopteryx: _am_, amnion; _g_,\r\n    edge of the ventral plate; _ps_, germ of primitive band; _se_,\r\n    serosa.—After Brandt, from Balfour.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 520.—Three farther stages of growth of Calopteryx. _B_ and _C_\r\n    show the inversion of the embryo: _a_, opening of the\r\n    amniotic-cavity, out of which the embryo emerges; _ab_, abdomen;\r\n    _am_, amnion; _at_, antenna; _md_, mandible; _mx^1_, _mx^2_, 1st\r\n    and 2d maxillæ; _œ_, œsophagus; _p^1_, _p^2_, _p^3_, legs; _se_,\r\n    serosa; _v_, anterior end of the primitive streak.—After Brandt,\r\n    from Balfour.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In insects with an invaginated primitive band, of which the Odonata\r\n  afford examples, the first rudiment of the primitive band is in the\r\n  form of a ventral plate of slight extent passing ventrally in the\r\n  hinder half of the egg, in whose posterior section a process of\r\n  invagination (Fig. 518, _A_, _kh_), soon occurs. The cavity of this\r\n  invagination is the first indication of the amnion-cavity (Fig. 518,\r\n  _B_, _ah_), while its wall in its thickened ventral part (_K′_) is\r\n  concerned in the formation of the primitive band, and, in its dorsal\r\n  thin part, in the formation of the amnion (_B_, _C_, _am_).\r\n\r\n  =Revolution of the embryo where the primitive band is\r\n  invaginated.=—At first the head-end of the embryo is directed\r\n  towards the posterior end of the egg, as in dragon-flies (Fig. 518).\r\n  Also that surface of the primitive band which afterwards faces the\r\n  ventral, is at first turned towards the dorsal side of the egg. In\r\n  order to bring the primitive band into the later relations, there\r\n  must occur the process of revolution, or turning, of the embryo. The\r\n  somewhat advanced embryo of the Odonata, after the appearance of the\r\n  head and thoracic appendages, undergoes a rotating motion around its\r\n  transverse axis, and at the same time turns out of the amniotic\r\n  cavity (Fig. 520, _B_). This process is so managed that near the\r\n  head-region, the amnion and serosa, there closely situated to each\r\n  other, are fused together, and at this place tear or burst open.\r\n  Through this rent (_a_), in the same place in which the original\r\n  invagination-opening was situated, the amniotic cavity again opens,\r\n  and through the opening thus formed first the head and then the\r\n  succeeding segments of the primitive band (Fig. 520, _B_) pass out,\r\n  and remain there while the head passes on to the anterior pole of\r\n  the egg on the ventral side, the embryo thus assuming a position\r\n  like that of other insects. (Kowalevsky.)\r\n\r\n  In the parasitic Hemiptera (Pediculina), according to Melnikow, the\r\n  opening in the membranes near the head remains permanent, and the\r\n  embryo becomes everted through it, while the yolk, enclosed in the\r\n  continuous membrane formed by the amnion and serous membrane, forms\r\n  a yolk-sac on the dorsal surface. The same process occurs in\r\n  Mallophaga, and also in Œcanthus, as described by Ayers (Fig. 521).\r\n  Generally as soon as the embryo passes out of the amniotic cavity\r\n  the latter soon becomes smaller and finally completely disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 521.—Revolution of the embryo of Œcanthus (diagrammatic): _a_,\r\n    fore, _b_, hind end of egg; _am_, amnion; _d_, dorsal, _v_,\r\n    ventral side of egg; _k_, primitive streak; _r_, dorsal plate\r\n    (originating by the contraction of the serosa (_s_)).—After Ayers,\r\n    from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  As the embryo grows, and the sides grow up and the back closes over,\r\n  the contents of the yolk-sac are soon taken up and absorbed in the\r\n  intestinal cavity, which communicates with it.\r\n\r\n  In Phyllodromia, according to Wheeler, the process of revolution is\r\n  “hurried through by the embryo from the beginning of the 16th to the\r\n  end of the 17th day.” Several successive stages are represented in\r\n  Fig. 522. In the 15th day the embryo still occupies the middle of\r\n  the ventral surface of the egg. Soon the envelopes (amnion and\r\n  serosa, _as_) rupture, an irregular slit being formed, and soon the\r\n  egg and embryo are as seen in Fig. 522, _B_, the embryo standing out\r\n  free from its envelopes on the yolk, and the edges of its dorsal\r\n  growing walls (_b_) are distinctly marked. The tail now lies at the\r\n  caudal end of the egg (Fig. 522, _C_). By the 17th day the walls\r\n  have closed in the median dorsal line, and the embryo has grown in\r\n  length to such an extent as to bring its head to the cephalic pole\r\n  (Fig. 522, _E_).\r\n\r\n  Korschelt and Heider consider, since the primitive band of the\r\n  chilopod myriopods (Geophilus) is curved in at the middle and sinks\r\n  into the interior of the yolk, that in insects the invaginated\r\n  primitive band is the ancestral or primitive one, the overgrown\r\n  primitive band being derived from it. The overgrown primitive band\r\n  by its position may also be better insured against certain\r\n  mechanical attacks, perhaps also against the danger of drying up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 522.—Embryo of Phyllodromia, 15 days old; revolution about to\r\n    begin. The stages in revolution are represented, after the rupture\r\n    of the amnion and serosa, in _A_ to _E_, which are from embryos 16,\r\n    16½, 16¾, and 17 days old respectively: _as_, amnion and serosa;\r\n    _s_, edge of serosa; _b_, dorsal growing body-wall; _d.o_, dorsal\r\n    organ; _x_, clear zone covered with scattered amniotic nuclei.—After\r\n    Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n            _f._ Formation of the external form of the body\r\n\r\n=Origin of the body-segments.=—As we have seen, the first traces of\r\nsegments appear very early, the primitive band being divided by\r\nsuperficial transverse furrows into segments. This segmentation into\r\narthromeres (somites or metameres) can be observed in Hydrophilus and\r\nChalicodoma at a time when gastrulation begins (Figs. 515, 536). The\r\nsegmentation extends not only across the median portion of the primitive\r\nband, through whose invagination the inner layer (endomesoderm) results,\r\nbut also to the lateral portions which become a part of the ectoderm of\r\nthe primitive band. These transverse furrows correspond to thinner\r\nplaces in the epithelium, which in this stage forms the embryonal\r\nrudiment. It thus happens that, in the forms named, after the end of\r\ngastrulation not only the ectoderm, but also the endomesoderm, is\r\nalready segmented.\r\n\r\n  So early an appearance of segmentation as that observed in\r\n  Hydrophilus and Chalicodoma we must regard as a falsification of the\r\n  process of development due to heterochrony. We must consider the\r\n  conditions observed in other forms as the primitive ones, in which\r\n  (as, for example, in Lina and in Stenobothrus, according to Graber)\r\n  the gastrulation and separation of the ectoderm occurs in the still\r\n  unsegmented primitive band, the division into segments occurring in\r\n  later stages (Fig. 524). In these forms, then, the segmentation\r\n  affects the invaginated endomesoderm, as well as the ectoderm.\r\n  (Korschelt and Heider, p. 789.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 523.—Diagrammatic cross-section through three successive\r\n    stages of Gryllotalpa, showing the formation of the heart.\r\n    (Compare Fig. 505.)

The anterior, the primary head-section,\r\ncontains the mouth-opening, and is characterized by its lateral\r\nexpansions, or procephalic lobes. The other section, or posterior\r\nsection, the so-called anal segment or telson, contains the anus.\r\nBetween the two sections lies the segmented primary trunk-segment, which\r\nin insects consists of 17 segments. Of these the three most anterior are\r\nthose destined to bear the mandibles and two pairs of maxillæ; the three\r\nfollowing are the thoracic, which are succeeded by 10 abdominal\r\nsegments, besides the 11th or telson (pygidium, or suranal plate).\r\n\r\n  It is now generally believed that there are primarily eleven\r\n  abdominal segments, while Heymons has detected twelve in the embryos\r\n  of Blattids and Forficula (see p. 162). In the later stages of\r\n  embryonic development the number of abdominal segments is\r\n  diminished, the 10th and 11th abdominal segments becoming fused. In\r\n  Hydrophilus and Lina this is the case, but according to Graber, in\r\n  the Lepidoptera there is a fusion of the 9th and 10th abdominal\r\n  segments, the llth remaining free.\r\n\r\n  According to Wheeler, in Doryphora, and also in Chalicodoma\r\n  (Carrière), between the primary head-region and the mandibular\r\n  segment is interpolated a rudimentary and transitory body-segment,\r\n  the premandibular segment. According to Carrière this segment\r\n  corresponds to a rudimentary pair of limbs, and also to a ganglion,\r\n  which participates in the formation of the œsophageal commissure\r\n  (see p. 51).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 524.—Three embryonic stages of a leaf-beetle (Lina): _A_,\r\n    unsegmented primitive streak; in _B_ and _C_ the segmentation\r\n    becomes distinct on the lower layer (_u_). _B_, with the germs of\r\n    the gnathal segments (_k′-k‴_), and in _C_ the three thoracic\r\n    segments (_t’-t‴_), with the first two abdominal segments (_a_′,\r\n    _a″_): _bl_, blastopore; _kl_, head-lobes; _th_, extension of the\r\n    primitive streak into the thoracic region.—After Graber, from\r\n    Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The procephalic lobes.=—The head-lobes, or procephalic lobes, appear at\r\na very early period (Fig. 524, _kl_), before any traces of the segments\r\nof the trunk region. Ayers has shown that in Œcanthus the primitive\r\nband, in its earliest condition and before the appearance of the\r\nhead-lobes, is a simple oval plate or almond-shaped thickening near the\r\nposterior end of the egg (Fig. 525, 1, 2). This plate is “soon divided\r\ninto two tolerably well-marked regions by the enlargement of the\r\nhead-end,” the first indication of the head-lobes (3). A depression next\r\nforms in what is to be the middle of the forehead. “It indicates the\r\nposition of the future labrum, and forms the inner boundaries of the two\r\ncephalic ganglia, which are developed on either side of this depression\r\nat a much later stage.” Almost simultaneously with the appearance of\r\nthis depression, two lateral folds are formed in the trunk portion of\r\nthe band, which are the first indications of the maxillary and thoracic\r\nregions, the abdominal portion not yet showing traces of a division into\r\nsegments (Fig. 525, 5). The thickened outer edges of the head-fold next\r\ngradually grow in towards the median line (Fig. 525, 5), and bend\r\nforward towards the region of the future mouth. The rounded angle made\r\nby the posterior end of the head-fold is the first indication of the\r\nantennæ. The embryo is now composed of four well-marked regions:\r\ncephalic, maxillary, thoracic, and abdominal. The primitive band then\r\ngrows much longer, the primitive mouth and anus appear, and the\r\nappendages bud out, and eventually the embryo revolves and appears on\r\nthe ventral side of the egg (Fig. 525, 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 525.—Early stages in the embryology of _Œcanthus niveus_.

The macrosomites are peculiar to\r\n  insects, and may be an inheritance from a hypothetical ancestral\r\n  form. With Korschelt and Heider, we should hardly share this view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 526.—Older embryo of Œcanthus with the appendages budded out,\r\n    those of the abdomen distinct: _abp_, first pair; _a.s_, anal\r\n    stylet; _pr_, proctodæum; _am_, amnion.—After Ayers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOur observations on locusts show clearly (1) that the procephalic lobes\r\nare the pleural portion of the first cephalic or antennal segment; (2)\r\nthat the antenna is an appendage or outgrowth of the procephalic lobes;\r\n(3) that the eyes are a specialized group of epidermal cells of the\r\nupper part of the procephalic lobes, and are not homologues of the\r\nantennæ or of the appendages in general; and (4) it seems to follow from\r\na study of the relations and mode of development of the clypeus and\r\nlabrum, that they arise between the procephalic lobes, and probably\r\nrepresent the tergal part of the antennal segment, forming the roof of\r\nthe mouth, _i.e._ closing in from above the pharynx.\r\n\r\nIn general the formation of the body-segments into the primitive band is\r\nin succession from before to the hinder end. This successive appearance\r\nhas been observed by Graber in genera of different orders (Stenobothrus,\r\nLina, and Hylotoma). For example, in the beetle Lina, after the\r\nappearance of the mandibular and two maxillary segments, appear the\r\nthree thoracic segments, together with the two anterior abdominal\r\nsegments, the other abdominal segments arising afterwards. In other\r\ncases, the formation of segments seems to be simultaneous along the\r\nentire length of the primitive band. An exception to the rule has been\r\nnoticed by Heider in Hydrophilus, as in this beetle the development of\r\nthe segments of the middle region appears somewhat delayed, while the\r\nfore and hind parts of the primitive band are more rapid in development.\r\nIn Pieris, according to Graber, the thoracic segments are more rapidly\r\ndeveloped than the others; soon after, the gnathic segments (mandibles\r\nand two pairs of maxillæ) appear, and finally the abdominal segments are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n=Fore-intestine (stomodæum) and hind-intestine (proctodæum),\r\nLabrum.=—The digestive canal of insects consists, as in other animals,\r\nof three portions, the fore, mid, and hind gut or intestine. The next\r\nchange after the completion of the segments of the primitive band is the\r\ndevelopment of the fore and hind intestine and the appendages. The\r\nfore-intestine (stomodæum) arises as an invagination in the area of the\r\nprimary head-section, and the hind-intestine (proctodæum) in the\r\nterminal section (Figs. 300 and 546).\r\n\r\n  In insects generally the formation of the fore-intestine occurs\r\n  earlier than that of the hind-intestine. An exception was discovered\r\n  by Graber and also by Voeltzkow in Muscidæ, where the proctodæum\r\n  appears earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 527.—Rudiments of the appendages of the embryo of Hydrophilus:\r\n    _an_, antenna; _md_, mandibles; _mx_{1}_, 1st, _mx_{2}_, 2d maxilla;\r\n    _vk_, clypeal region; _m_, mouth; _p^1-p^3_, legs; _p^4-p^9_,\r\n    rudiments of abdominal appendages, 1–9; _st_, stigma; _a_,\r\n    anus.—After Heider, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUsually at the time of origin of the stomodæum a projection arises at\r\nthe anterior edge of the primary head-region, the so-called forehead\r\n(Fig. 527, _vk_), which is the common rudiment of the clypeus and\r\nlabrum. In many cases (certain Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) these\r\nrudiments first assume the form of paired hooks (see Figs. 83, 102, 104,\r\n105, of Graber’s Keimstreif der Insekten, also Figs. 529 and 546), which\r\nafterwards, by fusion in the median line, become single, though notched\r\nin the middle; but in the more generalized Blatta and Mantis, as well as\r\nin bees, the rudiment is single at the outset.\r\n\r\n  The view advanced by Patten, and also by Carrière, that the labrum\r\n  is a first pair of antennæ, is scarcely tenable, and we quite agree\r\n  with Korschelt and Heider in regarding the clypeo-labral region as\r\n  homologous with the upper lip of Crustacea, and, we may add, of\r\n  Merostomes and of Trilobites.\r\n\r\n  It should be observed that in many insects, in their earlier\r\n  embryonic state, directly behind the mouth arises, from paired\r\n  rudiments, what seem provisional lower lip structures (not to be\r\n  confounded with the 2d maxillæ of insects). This under lip structure\r\n  was first discovered by Bütschli in the bee (his inner or 2d\r\n  antennæ), and afterwards by Tichomiroff in Lepidoptera. Heider, in\r\n  his work on Hydrophilus, describes it as the “lateral mouth-lips,”\r\n  while, more recently, Nusbaum has observed it in Meloë. This under\r\n  lip structure may be regarded as analogous to the paragnaths of\r\n  Crustacea, although to attempt to homologize it with these seems\r\n  useless. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n=Completion of the head.=—Sufficient attention has not been paid to this\r\nsubject by embryologists. The head is at first, dorsally, mostly\r\ncomposed of the head-lobes, or antennal segment only, and the dorsal or\r\ntergal portion of the oral appendages develop at a later period. We have\r\nobserved in the embryo of dragon-flies (Æschna) that the tergites of the\r\nmandibles and first maxillæ are simultaneously fused with the\r\nhead-lobes, while the much larger tergal region of the 2d maxillæ\r\nremains for some time separate from the anterior part of the head, and\r\nis continuous with the thoracic segments, and it is only just before\r\nhatching that this segment becomes fused with the rest of the head (Fig.\r\n36). In a sense, the 2d maxillary segment when it is free from the head\r\nreminds us of the foot-jaw, or 5th segment of chilopod myriopods (see\r\nalso p. 53).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _g._ The appendages\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, nearly or quite simultaneously all the limbs as a rule\r\nbud out from each side of the median line of the primitive band. They\r\narise as saccular evaginations or outgrowths of the ectoderm, directed a\r\nlittle backwards. They are at first filled with mesoderm cells, and in\r\nthe Orthoptera diverticula of the cœlom-sac are taken up into the\r\nrudimental limbs, as in Peripatus and Myriopoda. (Graber, Cholodkowsky.)\r\nAs the antennæ, mouth-parts, legs, and abdominal appendages are all\r\nalike at first, their strict homology with one another is thus\r\ndemonstrated. In insects never more than a single pair of limbs is known\r\nto arise from one segment.\r\n\r\n=The cephalic appendages.=—The antennæ evidently arise from the hinder\r\nedge of the procephalic lobes (Fig. 527, _an_). As in Limulus, the first\r\npair of appendages are at first postoral (Fig. 528, _at_), afterwards\r\nmoving forward owing to changes in the relative proportions of the parts\r\nof the head, and they are in all respects, in their development and\r\nposition in relation to the segment from which they arise, homologous\r\nwith the appendages succeeding them.\r\n\r\n  The occurrence of rudiments of a pair of preantennal appendages in\r\n  Chalicodoma which is claimed by Carrière, needs confirmation, as\r\n  other embryologists have not observed them.\r\n\r\nThe postoral appendages of the head are the mandibles and the 1st and 2d\r\nmaxillæ, besides the supposed premandibular segment already referred to\r\non pp. 50–54, which only temporarily exists.\r\n\r\nThe trophi or oral appendages are all alike at first, but soon differ in\r\nshape, acquiring their characteristic form shortly before the embryo\r\nleaves the egg. The mandibles of Œcanthus are said by Ayers at the time\r\nof revolution of the embryo to be slightly bilobed, and in his Fig. 5,\r\nPl. 19, they are represented as deeply trilobed, but in general they are\r\nundivided. The 1st maxillæ are at this time distinctly trilobed. The 2d\r\nmaxillæ are separate, and distinctly though unequally bilobed, becoming\r\nunited shortly before birth. In the embryos of dragon-flies they are at\r\nan early date very large and long, and directed backwards, and are not\r\nfused together until just before hatching, when the extraordinary\r\nmask-shaped labium is fully developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 528.—Two embryonic stages of the primitive streak of Melolontha.\r\n    _A_, younger stage, with rudiments of eight pairs of abdominal\r\n    appendages (_a^1–a^8_). _B_, older stage, the primitive band now\r\n    very broad: _a_, 1st abdominal appendage, in _B_ sac-like; _x_,\r\n    place of adhesive disc; _g_, brain; _l_, clypeo-labrum; _s_, lateral\r\n    cord of the ventral nervous cord; other lettering as in previous\r\n    figures.—After Graber, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe distal parts of the labium, such as the ligula, palpifer, and palpus\r\nare elaborated before the mentum and submentum. Many details as to the\r\nfinal changes in the mouth-parts before hatching remain to be worked\r\nout.\r\n\r\n=The thoracic appendages.=—The three pairs of legs arise at the same\r\nperiod and in the same manner in all insects; it is not until the end of\r\nembryonic life that they become jointed, and that the claws and onychia\r\nare developed. Especial attention has not yet been given to the details\r\nof the development of the parts of the last joint of the tarsus.\r\n\r\n  In many forms the antennæ are the first to appear, the mandibles,\r\n  maxillæ, and legs appearing at a latter date, though simultaneously.\r\n  It is thus in Stenobothrus, Hydrophilus, and Melolontha. In Lina,\r\n  according to Graber, the mandibles precede the antennæ in\r\n  appearance. In the Libellulidæ, according to Brandt, the legs first\r\n  appear, then the jaws, and lastly the antennæ. This did not seem to\r\n  be the case in the embryos of Æschna observed by us, although our\r\n  observations were more superficial.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, in those insects whose larvæ are footless, the\r\n  rudiments of the legs are retarded and aborted just before hatching\r\n  (fossorial Hymenoptera and Apidæ), or the rudiments of the legs are\r\n  not developed at all.\r\n\r\n=The abdominal appendages.=—These appear soon after the thoracic limbs,\r\ncorresponding in most cases to the latter in shape and position, and\r\ntheir position in the embryo is a matter of the greatest interest. Von\r\nRathke was the first embryologist to detect those of the first abdominal\r\nsegment, in his examination of the development of Gryllotalpa. Long\r\nafterwards Bütschli detected them in the embryo of the honey-bee,\r\nobserving a pair on each segment. Patten observed them in Trichoptera;\r\nKowalevsky first perceived them in Lepidoptera, Tichomiroff confirming\r\nhis observations. Graber, Ayers, and Wheeler have observed them in\r\nOrthoptera and Coleoptera, and the latter has detected them also in\r\nHemiptera and Neuroptera; and while they do not arise in the embryos of\r\nDiptera and of Siphonaptera, they are to be looked for in any or all the\r\nlower or more generalized orders.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these discoveries of polypodous embryos occurring in\r\nall but the most specialized order (Diptera), it appears to be a\r\nrational deduction that the winged insects have descended from insects\r\nin which there were functional legs on each abdominal segment. Such an\r\nancestor was the forerunner of the Thysanura, in which abdominal\r\nlocomotive appendages still survive, though in a modified, more or less\r\naborted condition. This polypodous ancestral form was apparently allied\r\nto Scolopendrella, which has a pair of functional legs on each abdominal\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\n  The subject, then, of polypodous embryo insects is one of special\r\n  interest, and has attracted much attention from Graber, Wheeler,\r\n  Haase, and others. That these are genuine, though transitory\r\n  appendages, is shown by the fact that certain pairs persist\r\n  throughout adult life. The embryology of the Thysanura when worked\r\n  out will throw much light on this subject, but we know that the\r\n  spring (elater) of Collembola (and possibly the collophore) and the\r\n  cerci of the winged insects are survivals of these limbs. That the\r\n  three pairs of appendages forming the ovipositor, or sting, are most\r\n  probably derived from these appendages is claimed by Wheeler (p.\r\n  167), and seems proved by the fact that Ganin and also Bugnion has\r\n  detected three pairs of imaginal disks in the embryo of parasitic\r\n  Hymenoptera. Hence the abdominal appendages may ultimately be found\r\n  to arise in nearly all cases from imaginal disks like those giving\r\n  origin to the cephalic and thoracic appendages.\r\n\r\n  As regards the Diptera, Pratt has observed that each of the three\r\n  thoracic and eight abdominal segments of the embryo brachycerous\r\n  Diptera (seen especially well in Melophagus) has two pairs of\r\n  imaginal disks, a dorsal and a ventral pair. He thinks there is no\r\n  doubt but that the ventral abdominal disks are homologous with the\r\n  rudimentary appendages which appear in the embryos of all other\r\n  insects, though not in the brachycerous dipters.\r\n\r\n=Appendages of the first abdominal segment (pleuropodia).=—As early as\r\n1844 Rathke observed in the embryo of the mole-cricket a pair of\r\nappendages on the 1st abdominal segment, which he described as\r\nmushroom-shaped bodies, and supposed to be embryonic gills. They are\r\ncalled _pleuropodia_ by Wheeler, who, with Patten, Graber, and Nusbaum,\r\nascribes a glandular function to them, while Wheeler suggests that they\r\nwere odoriferous repugnatorial organs. In Blatta (Phyllodromia) they are\r\nof large size, in Melolontha enormous (Fig. 528, _B_) and filled with\r\nblood. Wheeler distinguishes as varieties, beside the mushroom-shaped\r\nappendages of Gryllotalpa and Hydrophilus, the reniform (Œcanthus), the\r\nbroadly pyriform (Blatta), and the elongate pyriform (_Mantis\r\ncarolina_). In the European Mantis they are most limb-like, with a\r\ndigitiform continuation divided by a constriction into two sections.\r\n(Graber.) In Meloë they assume the shape of a stalked cup. (Nusbaum.) In\r\nthe bee and in Lepidoptera the pleuropodia are not present, though the\r\ntemporary appendages on the succeeding segments appear; Carrière,\r\nhowever, found them on the two first abdominal segments of very young\r\nlarvæ of the wall-bee (Chalicodoma).\r\n\r\nTheir cellular structure is peculiar, and they are either formed by\r\nevagination or invagination, those of the latter type being subspherical\r\nand solid. Those of the former type have a cavity communicating by means\r\nof a narrow duct through the peduncle with the body-cavity (Blatta). No\r\ntracheæ, nerves, or muscles enter them, though blood-corpuscles have\r\nbeen seen in the cavities. “In some species the pleuropodia produce a\r\nsecretion from the ends of their enlarged cells. This secretion may be a\r\nglairy albuminoid substance (Cicada, Meloë), a granular mass\r\n(Stenobothrus), a bundle of threads (Zaitha), or a thick, striated,\r\ncuticula-like mass (Acilius).” They attain their greatest size during\r\nthe revolution of the embryo, and they are “mere rudiments of what were\r\nprobably in remote ages much larger and more complex organs.” (Wheeler.)\r\n\r\n  Lameere has observed that in Phyllodromia the first pair of\r\n  abdominal appendages, after becoming of considerable size, undergo\r\n  an enlargement at their free end, become detached, and fall into the\r\n  amnion.\r\n\r\n  Wheeler also calls attention to the homology of these pleuropodia\r\n  with the 1st abdominal appendages of Campodea, shown by Haase to be\r\n  originally glandular, but with at present a respiratory function. In\r\n  the embryos of later, higher orders of insects, these appendages are\r\n  in size and shape similar to those of the succeeding segments. (See\r\n  also p. 164.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 529.—Primitive band of _Bombyx mori_, showing the temporary legs\r\n    on abdominal segments 2–11: _A_, early stage, in which the abdominal\r\n    legs _al^2–al^10_ appear. _B_, later stage, when they are very faint\r\n    and all except _al^3–al^6_ and _al^10_ are about to disappear. _C_,\r\n    the persistent abdominal legs _al^3–al^6_ and _al^10_; _st^2_,\r\n    _st^9_, the 2d and 3d pair of stigmata; _sgl_, silk duct.—After\r\n    Tichomiroff.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Are the abdominal legs of larval Lepidoptera and phytophagous\r\nHymenoptera true limbs?=—The presence of these abdominal legs in the\r\nembryos of Sphinx (Kowalevsky), of _Bombyx mori_ (Tichomiroff), and both\r\n_Bombyx mori_ and _Gastropacha quercifolia_ (except those of the first\r\nsegment), as well as in Hylotoma, which has 11 pairs of such appendages,\r\nhas suggested that the prop or prolegs of caterpillars and saw-fly larvæ\r\nare survivals of these outgrowths, and not secondary, adaptive\r\nstructures. Opinions on this point vary. Balfour, and also, more\r\nrecently, Cholodkowsky, hold that the prolegs are survivals of the\r\nembryonic appendages. Graber cautiously, after a lengthy and interesting\r\ndiscussion, says that the question cannot be, in the present state of\r\nour knowledge, solved. He, however, seems inclined to believe that the\r\nprolegs are not merely secondary structures, and that the rudiments of\r\nlimbs may remain for a long time in a latent state before their final\r\ndevelopment. Korschelt and Heider are disposed to regard the abdominal\r\nappendages of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera as true limbs, referring to\r\nBalfour’s statement that in the Crustacea there are different examples\r\nof the loss and later appearance of limbs, such as the loss of the\r\nmandibular palpi of the zoëa of decapods, and the loss in the zoëa of\r\nappendages in the Erichthus form of the Squilla larva corresponding to\r\nthe third pair of maxillipedes and first two pairs of legs of Decapoda,\r\nand which are afterwards reproduced; similar cases occurring in the\r\nAcarina. In the wasps and bees also, as is well known, the imaginal\r\ndisks of the thoracic appendages appear, the legs themselves being\r\nsuppressed in the larva (the imaginal disk probably existing in an\r\nindifferent state), to reappear in the pupa and imago. It does not,\r\nhowever, necessarily follow that the numerous pairs of hooked ventral\r\ntubercles of certain dipterous larvæ (Ephydra) are true appendages.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that it is a strong argument for the view that these\r\nprolegs are survivals of primitive limbs, that from similar embryonic\r\npaired outgrowths on different segments arise the spring of Podurans,\r\nthe anal cerci, and three pairs of appendages forming the ovipositor,\r\nand the anal legs of the Corydalus larva, as well as those of\r\ncaddis-worms; at least five abdominal segments throughout the class of\r\ninsects as a whole bearing appendages in the adult.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the view of Haase, that the prolegs of caterpillars\r\nare secondary, adaptive characters, is supported by the fact of the\r\nrapidity with which two pairs on the 3d and 4th segments nearly\r\ndisappear in the larvæ of certain Noctuidæ (Catocala, etc.), a reduction\r\nevidently due to disuse.\r\n\r\n=The tracheæ.=—The tracheal system arises as ectodermal invaginations on\r\none side of the appendages, appearing soon after the latter. The\r\nearliest condition of the tracheal invagination is seen in section at\r\nFig. 539, _E_, _tr_; as it deepens, it sends off diverticula or tracheal\r\nbranches, while the narrow mouth of the invagination forms the stigma.\r\nThe cup-like cavities situated serially one behind the other, and\r\narising from the single tracheal invaginations, become at the end or\r\nbottom of the cup elongated along the length of the body and fused\r\ntogether at their ends; then the two longitudinal stems of the system\r\narise, by a breaking through at the place where the original\r\ninvagination had become fused, thus forming a continuous tube, the\r\nlumina opening into each other. (Bütschli.)\r\n\r\nThe cuticular tracheal intima is differentiated late in embryonic life.\r\nThe entrance of the air is accomplished in part before the embryo\r\nhatches, the air being derived from the tissues and fluids of the body.\r\n\r\n  The farther development of the tracheal branches is due to the\r\n  progressive formation of diverticula. The branches thus arising are\r\n  intercellular formations. On the other hand, the finest twigs are\r\n  intercellular structures. However, as Schaeffer states, the\r\n  differences between the two modes of formation are not important.\r\n\r\n  Wheeler mentions the existence of “two pairs of very indistinct\r\n  tracheal openings in the 10th and 11th somites” of the abdomen of\r\n  Doryphora (Fig. 546, _t_{19}_, _t_{20}_), and Heider believes that\r\n  they exist in Hydrophilus.\r\n\r\nThe tracheal invaginations as a rule begin to appear after the\r\nappendages commence to bud out. An exception is met with in the bee\r\n(Apis), where the tracheal ingrowths are seen before the rudiments of\r\nthe legs. Most of the tracheal invaginations appear simultaneously. Only\r\nrarely do we see an indication of their successive development from\r\nbefore backwards. Thus in Hydrophilus, Graber observed that the\r\nmesothoracic stigmata appeared somewhat earlier than those of the other\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _h._ Nervous system\r\n\r\nThe rudiments of the nervous and tracheal systems essentially contribute\r\nto the building up of the relief of the primitive band of insects. The\r\nnervous system is the earliest to appear, being indicated very early, in\r\nfact before the appendages begin to grow out. The first traces of the\r\nnervous system are two ridges extending along the primitive band, the\r\ndepression between them being called the primitive furrow. At an early\r\nperiod the segmentation is observed in the primitive ridges, while\r\nwidened spaces (the rudiments of the ventral ganglia) alternate\r\nsegmentally with the narrow places which are the incipient longitudinal\r\ncommissures (Fig. 527, _A_, _g_).\r\n\r\nThe primitive ridges extend anteriorly into the head-lobes; this part\r\nmust be regarded as the rudiment of the œsophageal commissure. The\r\nrudiments of the brain are from their first appearance directly\r\nconnected with the ventral chain of ganglia.[83]\r\n\r\n=Completion of the definite form of the body.=—This is accomplished by\r\nthe growth of the primitive band around the yolk, the band widening, so\r\nthat its edges behind the head extend up, and finally meet on the back,\r\nforming the back or tergum of the embryo, thus enclosing the yolk (Fig.\r\n530, _F_). The tergal wall of the head is due to the dorsal growth of\r\nthe head-lobes, and of the clypeo-labral region. In the course of this\r\nprocess the anterior end of the primitive band becomes turned up\r\ndorsally, forming a dorsal curve or bend. By this bending up of the\r\nprimitive band the forehead nearest the mouth forms a transverse ridge,\r\nthe labrum, while the basal or earlier part of the forehead now is\r\ndifferentiated into the clypeus. This clypeo-labral region likewise\r\nforms the roof or palatal region of the mouth. The head-lobes cause by\r\nthis dorsal growth a rotating motion which carries the rudimental\r\nantennæ back over the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 530.—Diagram of the formation of the dorsal organ in Hydrophilus.\r\n    _A_, cross-section through an egg, whose primitive streak is still\r\n    covered over by amnion (_a_) and serosa (_s_). _B_, amnion and\r\n    serosa are grown together in the middle line, then separated and\r\n    drawn back to form a fold on each side. _C_, by the contraction of\r\n    the serosa (_s_),which becomes converted into the dorsal plate, the\r\n    folds become drawn up dorsally. _D_, the contracted serosa becomes\r\n    partly overgrown by the folds. _E_, the folds grow together to form\r\n    the dorsal tube. _F_, the mid-gut has closed over dorsally and\r\n    enclosed the dorsal tube (_s_): _a_, amnion; _d_, yolk; _ec_,\r\n    ectoderm; _h_, heart; _l_, body-cavity; _m_, rudiment of the\r\n    mid-gut; _n_, nervous system; _s_, serosa (in _C_ and _D_ = dorsal\r\n    plate, in _E_ and _F_, dorsal tube); _tr_, the chief tracheal\r\n    stem.—After Graber and Kowalevsky, from Lang, and Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe gnathal or post-antennal segments at first bear but a small part in\r\ncompleting the tergal region of the head, but shortly before hatching\r\nthe mandibles and their muscles enlarge, giving fulness to the upper and\r\nback part of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _i._ Dorsal closure and involution of the embryonic membranes\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 531.—Schematic figure of the formation of the dorsal tube by\r\n    invagination of the dorsal plate (transformed serosa); following\r\n    after stage Fig. 520, _C_, and Fig. 521, _D_; _am_, amnion (now\r\n    forming the provisional dorsal closure); _r_, dorsal tube, whose\r\n    cells are already breaking away.—After Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn most other Arthropoda (Crustacea, Arachnida, Myriopoda, etc.)\r\ndevelopment goes on by the formation of a so-called primitive band, but\r\nwithout the appearance of peculiar embryonic membranes. The outer\r\nsurface of the entire egg becomes, then, in part covered by the\r\nband-like embryonic germ, and partly by a portion of the blastoderm\r\nwhich remains unchanged. The dorsal region is formed by the widening and\r\nspreading of the primitive band over the greater part of the surface of\r\nthe egg, while the area of the unchanged section of the blastoderm\r\ncontinually becomes more restricted. It is generally accepted that the\r\nlatter is concerned in the dorsal closure, because, together with a\r\nhistological transformation, it becomes involved in the formation of the\r\nectoderm of the primitive band.\r\n\r\n  A similar form of retrograde structure possibly occurs in the\r\n  embryos of Poduridæ, in which a dorsal organ has been observed to\r\n  develop in an early embryonic stage, which bears some relation to\r\n  the cuticula enveloping the embryo, but whose significance is in\r\n  general rather obscure.\r\n\r\n  In most insects the relations are more complicated, since in such\r\n  cases, the amnion-folds rise on the edges of the primitive band and\r\n  of the unchanged section of the blastoderm, whose retrograde\r\n  development is intimately connected with the closure of the back.\r\n\r\n  A very simple case of dorsal closure, but which certainly is not a\r\n  primitive one, occurs in Muscidæ and certain other Diptera whose\r\n  amnion-folds are developed in a rudimentary way. In this case\r\n  (according to Kowalevsky and Graber), the amnion-folds become\r\n  smoothed out again. Amnion and serosa become then a simple\r\n  epithelium, which throughout corresponds to the unmodified type of\r\n  blastoderm of Crustacea, Arachnida, and Myriopoda, and here seems to\r\n  share in the formation of the back. More complicated and very\r\n  manifold relations of dorsal closure and involution of the embryonal\r\n  membranes occur in other insects, of which Korschelt and Heider\r\n  distinguish four different types:\r\n\r\n  1. Involution under the formation of a continuous dorsal\r\n  amnion-serosa-sac (Odonata).\r\n\r\n  2. Involution with exclusively dorsal absorption of the amnion\r\n  (Doryphora).\r\n\r\n  3. Involution with exclusively dorsal absorption of serosa and\r\n  separation of the amnion (Chironomus and Trichoptera).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 532.—Diagram of the formation of the dorsal walls in Doryphora\r\n    in cross-sections: _am_, amnion; in _B_, serving as a provisional\r\n    dorsal closure, in _C_, about to break up; _k_, primitive band;\r\n    _s_, serosa.—After Wheeler, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  4. Involution with separation of both embryonic membranes\r\n  (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, Hylotoma).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 533.—Involution of the embryonic membranes of Chironomus: _am_,\r\n    amnion; _r_, dorsal umbilicus; _s_, serosa, which has withdrawn\r\n    into the region of the dorsal umbilicus, and in _C_ has passed\r\n    into the interior of the embryo.—After Graber, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The first type occurs in the most primitive order of winged insects.\r\n  The second type (Coleoptera) appears to be an independently\r\n  inherited form of dorsal closure. In the first type, the formation\r\n  of the amnion-serosa-sac is initiated by a rupture of the two fused\r\n  embryonic membranes. This rupture in the ventral middle line occurs\r\n  in Odonata only in the region of the head-section. In the second\r\n  type only the amnion, in the third only the serosa are concerned in\r\n  this rupture, while in the fourth type both membranes remain intact\r\n  until the slipping out of the larva.

Bütschli first found that in the\r\nbee, by a kind of folding process, an inner layer of the primitive band\r\narose. Soon afterwards Kowalevsky, by the employment of section-cutting\r\nand thorough researches, laid the foundation of a more exact knowledge\r\nof these layers. He found that in Hydrophilus a furrow extended along\r\nthe whole length of the primitive band (Fig. 515, _A_, _B_, _r_), which,\r\nwhile invaginating or sinking in, gave rise to the inner layer of the\r\nprimitive band, i.e. the common rudiment of endoderm and mesoderm (Fig.\r\n539, _A-C_).\r\n\r\nKowalevsky also found similar conditions in the honey-bee (Apis),\r\nLepidoptera, and other forms. The furrow above mentioned must be\r\nregarded as a very long gastrula invagination, extending along the\r\nentire ventral side of the embryo, and the edges of the furrow as a\r\nlong-drawnout blastopore. The tube arising in Hydrophilus through the\r\nclosing of the furrow we may regard as a primitive intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe first rudiment of the gastrula furrow appears in insects as two\r\nfolds extending along both sides of the median line in the thickened\r\nventral plate (Fig. 536, _f_), through whose formation a more median\r\nsection of the ventral plate, the so-called middle plate (_m_), becomes\r\nseparated from the side plates (_s_). As the middle plate curves in and\r\nbecomes overgrown by the folds forming the edges of the blastopore, the\r\ngastrula-tube (Fig. 539, _A_, _r_) is formed, and furnishes the\r\nrudiments of the lower (inner) layer. The ectoderm, then, according to\r\nHeider, arises from the lateral plates of the primitive band. The growth\r\nof the edges of the blastopore, by which the closure of the\r\ngastrula-tube is effected, takes place latest in the region of the most\r\nanterior part of the furrow (Fig. 515, _B_ and _C_), corresponding to\r\nthat place in the primitive band in which the stomodæum afterwards\r\ndevelops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 535.—Two embryonic stages of a saw-fly (_Hylotoma berberidis_) in\r\n    schematic median section: _a^1–a^{10}_, 1st to 10th abdominal\r\n    segments; _bg_, ventral nervous cord; _og_, brain; _ol_, germ of\r\n    labrum; _sp_, salivary gland; _ed_, hind-gut; _x_, _x′_, inner folds\r\n    of amnion: other letters as before.—After Graber, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 536.—Gastrula stage of the wall-bee (Chalicodoma), so-called\r\n    flask-shaped stage: _f_, folds which on each side border the middle\r\n    plate (edge of the blastopore); _m_, the partly segmented middle\r\n    plate (here = rudiment of the mesoderm); _s_, the segmented lateral\r\n    plate (becoming afterwards the ectoderm of the primitive band);\r\n    _ve_, fore, _he_, hinder entodermal rudiment.—After Carrière, from\r\n    Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 537.—Two successive stages in the gastrulation of Apis.\r\n    Cross-section through the primitive band: _b_, lower (inner) layer;\r\n    _ec_, ectoderm.—After Grassi, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the invagination of the middle plate and its transformation into\r\nthe gastrula-tube a change takes place in its histological character\r\n(Fig. 539, _A_ and _B_). While it originally consists of a high cylinder\r\nepithelium, which after farther changes becomes divided into several\r\nlayers, since the wedge-shaped single cells push themselves over each\r\nother, the cells in later stages become more and more cubical or\r\nirregularly polygonal (Fig. 539, _B_), and are irregularly arranged. At\r\nthe same time the gastrula-tube is compressed in a dorso-ventral\r\ndirection. While it in this way spreads out laterally under the side\r\nplates (ectoderm), its originally circular primitive lumen passes into\r\nthe form of a horizontal fissure, which in Hydrophilus long remains as\r\nthe boundary between the two layers of the inner (or lower) membrane.\r\n(Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  There are numerous variations of the process of gastrulation, which\r\n  are by Korschelt and Heider divided into three types, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. Through invagination and formation of a tube (Fig. 539, _A_,\r\n  Hydrophilus, Musca, Pyrrhocoris, etc.).\r\n\r\n  2. By a lateral overgrowth (Fig. 537, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera).\r\n\r\n  3. By an inward growth of cells from a median furrow (Aphides and\r\n  Trichoptera).\r\n\r\n  In Doryphora and Lina (Fig. 524) the hinder end of the gastrula\r\n  furrow is forked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 538.—Diagrammatic sketch of the formation of the germinal layers\r\n    in Doryphora: _A_, view of upper surface. _B_, cross-section through\r\n    the fore end of the primitive streak at the line _a-a_. _C_, section\r\n    through the middle of the primitive streak corresponding to the line\r\n    _b-b_. _D_, section through the hinder end of the primitive band\r\n    corresponding to the line _c-c_: _bl_, blastopore; _ec_, ectoderm;\r\n    _en′_, anterior U-shaped; _en″_, hinder U-shaped germ of the\r\n    endoderm; _ms_, mesoderm.—After Wheeler, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cellular layer arising from the gastrula invagination (lower layer)\r\nforms the common germ of the endoderm and mesoderm. It has only recently\r\nbecome known how these two germ-layers of insects have become\r\ndifferentiated. Kowalevsky first discovered in Musca that the greatest\r\npart of the lower (inner) layer yielded mesoderm exclusively, and that a\r\ncell-mass only corresponding to the most anterior and posterior end of\r\nthe primitive band was used in the formation of the endoderm. We must\r\ntherefore, in insects, speak of a fore and a hinder endodermal rudiment.\r\nIn proportion, now, as the ectodermal invaginations, which are destined\r\nto form the stomodæum and the proctodæum sink beneath the surface of the\r\nembryo, the cell-masses of which the two endodermal rudiments are\r\ncomposed are pushed farther in, and a separation between them and the\r\nmesoderm is thus effected. The two endodermal rudiments now form\r\naccumulations of cells which lie closely adjacent to the blind ends of\r\nthe stomodeal and the proctodeal invaginations. They soon widen out into\r\ntwo hour-glass-shaped rudiments, which are directed with their\r\nconcavities towards each other, but with their convex side towards the\r\nnearest pole of the egg. They soon change their form; two lateral\r\nstripes grow out from them, and each now assumes the form of a U (Fig.\r\n538, _en′_). The limbs of the fore and hind U-shaped rudiment are\r\ndirected toward each other, and grow towards each other until they meet,\r\nand are fused together. Thus the endodermal rudiments arising out of the\r\nfusion of the two U-shaped rudiments form two stripes extending along\r\nthe primitive band and situated mostly under the primitive segments. At\r\nthe two ends the endodermal rudiment fuses with the stomodeal and\r\nproctodeal invaginations. These lateral endodermal streaks now spread\r\nout, and gradually begin to grow over the yolk, on whose outer surface\r\nthey lie. This overgrowth makes the greater advance on the ventral side,\r\nso that the two endodermal streaks first unite in the ventral median\r\nline and afterward in the dorsal. The yolk in this way passes completely\r\ninto the interior of the rudiment of the mid-intestine.\r\n\r\n  Kowalevsky has already proved that it is the median parts only of\r\n  the inner layer which at the two ends of the primitive band become\r\n  separated as endodermal rudiments through the advance of the\r\n  stomodeal and proctodeal invaginations: the lateral portions become\r\n  mesoderm.\r\n\r\n  Kowalevsky has compared the germ-layers of insects with those of\r\n  Sagitta. This comparison is supported by the later researches of\r\n  Heider and of Wheeler on Coleoptera. (See Korschelt and Heider, p.\r\n  809.)\r\n\r\n  Relations somewhat different from the common type of formation of\r\n  germ-layers occur in Hymenoptera. Kowalevsky and also Grassi agree\r\n  that here also the endoderm originally forms a part of the lower\r\n  (inner) layer. But the separation of the endoderm from the mesoderm\r\n  goes on in Apis in such a way that the two ends of the inner layer\r\n  pass up to the dorsal side of the egg, where the fore and hind\r\n  rudiments of the endoderm extending along the back of the embryo\r\n  grow together. When the two horseshoe-shaped rudiments have met each\r\n  other and become fused, the enclosing of the yolk begins, which\r\n  accordingly here proceeds from the dorsal towards the ventral side,\r\n  instead of _vice versa_. As a result the endodermal cell-layer in\r\n  Apis (and also Chalicodoma) at first does not lie under the\r\n  primitive band, but on the dorsal side of the egg under that flat\r\n  epithelium, which, arising from the amnion-fold, completes the\r\n  provisional closure of the back.\r\n\r\n  The yolk-cells and secondary yolk-segmentation are discussed by\r\n  Korschelt and Heider at this point. The yolk-cells are elements\r\n  scattered throughout the yolk and which partly remain in the yolk\r\n  during the formation of the blastoderm (Fig. 507, _C_ and _D_), but\r\n  which in part through a later immigration pass out of the blastoderm\r\n  into the yolk. Graber has proved the fact of the migration of cells\r\n  from the lower layer into the yolk, and his observations have been\r\n  confirmed by other authors. Indeed, in certain cases (Melolontha),\r\n  these later immigrant cells are clearly distinguishable by their\r\n  histological characters from those originally found in the yolk.\r\n\r\n  The yolk-cells are regularly scattered throughout the yolk. Their\r\n  use to the embryo lies in the fact that they absorb the particles of\r\n  yolk, which they digest and thus reduce to a fluid condition. It\r\n  usually happens that after the complete formation of the primitive\r\n  band there results a delimitation of the areas enclosing each\r\n  yolk-cell, and this occurrence is called _secondary yolk-division_.\r\n  In special cases (Apis, Musca) this occurrence seems not to take\r\n  place. The yolk-cells are still, after the complete formation of the\r\n  mid-intestine, to be recognized in the yolk-remnants filling the\r\n  interior of the same, and gradually become absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n _k._ Farther development of the mesoderm. Formation of the body-cavity\r\n\r\nWe have seen that by means of an invagination extending throughout the\r\nentire length of the primitive band a layer of cells is produced which\r\nsoon spreads out on the inner side of the band and thus forms a second\r\nlower (inner) layer (Fig. 539, _C_). From this inner layer is separated\r\nat the anterior and posterior ends of the primitive band, the endoderm,\r\nwhich lies in direct contact with the invaginations of the proctodæum\r\nand stomodæum. The remainder, by far the most extensive part of the\r\ninner layer, is the mesoderm.\r\n\r\nThe mesoderm now becomes divided into two lateral streaks (mesodermal\r\nstreaks), by the withdrawal of its cells from the median line (Fig. 539,\r\n_D_). This withdrawal is not, however, always a complete one. In the\r\nfree median space thus formed, the yolk often forms the so-called\r\n_median yolk-ridge_. Segmentally arranged cavities soon appear in the\r\nlateral region of the mesoderm (the primitive segmental cavities), and\r\nthe bordering mesoderm-cells arrange themselves in the form of an\r\nepithelium, and constitute the wall of the primitive segments or\r\ncœlom-sac. (Korschelt and Heider).\r\n\r\n  The primitive segmental cavities in general arise through a split in\r\n  the mesoderm. In Phyllodromia, according to Heymons, the primitive\r\n  segments are very extensive. The mesoderm, at the time of the\r\n  formation of the rudiments of the appendages, is raised with the\r\n  ectoderm from the surface of the yolk, and in this way there arise\r\n  in each segment cavities, which, since they are surrounded by\r\n  mesodermal elements, become the closed cœlom-sacs (Fig. 540, _c_,\r\n  _c′_, _c″_).\r\n\r\n  The cœlom-sacs differ in different groups. They are largest in\r\n  Orthoptera (Phyllodromia), where they take up almost all the cell\r\n  material of the mesoderm in their formation, and exhibit certain\r\n  conditions recalling those of Peripatus. The very large primitive\r\n  segmental cavities, which in Orthoptera also extend into the\r\n  rudiments of the appendages (Fig. 540, _B_, _ex_), in their later\r\n  stages are, through the formation of a constriction, divided into a\r\n  dorsal and a ventral half (Fig. 540, _B_, _c′_, _c″_). The ventral\r\n  portions of these cavities extending into the extremities soon\r\n  disappear, while the cells of their walls lose their epithelial\r\n  nature, and group themselves irregularly into a sort of mesenchym.\r\n  In this tissue, then, arises, partly through a separation among its\r\n  cells, partly through the elevation of the same from the upper\r\n  surface of the yolk, _the definite body-cavity_. The dorsal portions\r\n  of the primitive segmental cavities remain unchanged a longer time\r\n  in order to play a rôle in the formation of the intestinal muscular\r\n  layer, of the heart, pericardial septum, and sexual organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 539.—Cross-section through the primitive streak of Hydrophilus in\r\n    six successive stages: _A_, gastrula-stage (compare Fig. 515, _A_,\r\n    corresponding to the point _a_). _B_, cross-section through stage,\r\n    Fig. 515, _D_, in the most anterior section of the primitive band,\r\n    where the same is not completely overgrown by the amnion-folds. _C_,\r\n    cross-section through the trunk-segment of stage, Fig. 515, _E_.\r\n    _D_, _E_, _F_, cross-sections through later stages: _am_, amnion;\r\n    _b_, lower (inner) layer; _d_, yolk; _dz_, yolk-cells; _ec_,\r\n    ectoderm; _en_, entoderm; _l_, definite body-cavity; _pr_, primitive\r\n    groove (= neural groove); _pw_, primitive roll, or strip, of the\r\n    ventral nerve-cord; _r_, blastopore; _sp_, fissure in the mesoderm\r\n    (remains of the cavity of the primitive intestine); _se_, serosa;\r\n    _s_, lateral cord of the rudiment of the nervous cord; _spm_,\r\n    splanchnic layer of the mesoderm; _tr_, rudiment of a trachea (in\r\n    _E_ appearing as an invagination of the ectoderm) in _F_ in\r\n    cross-section; _us_, primitive segment (= cœlomic sac).—After\r\n    Heider, from Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 540.—Cross-sections through the abdominal part of three\r\n    successive stages of evolution of _Phyllodromia germanica_: _am_,\r\n    amnion; _bg_, rudiment of the ventral nervous chord; _c_, cœlomic\r\n    cavity; _c′_, dorsal, and _c″_, ventral, section of the cœlomic sac;\r\n    _cz_, cells of the walls of the primitive segment, which are joined\r\n    to the genital rudiments; _gz_, genital cells; _dw_, dorsal wall of\r\n    the cœlomic sac; _d_, yolk; _ec_, ectoderm; _ep_, epithelium-cells;\r\n    _ex_, rudiment of the abdominal appendages; _f_, germ of the\r\n    fat-body; _lw_, lateral wall of the cœlomic sac; _m_, mesoderm\r\n    cells, which take no part in the formation of the cœlomic sac; _mw_,\r\n    median wall of the cœlomic sac; _so_, somatic mesoderm layer; _vm_,\r\n    ventral longitudinal muscle.—After Heymons, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the highest groups of insects (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and\r\n  Hymenoptera) the primitive segments are not so extensively developed\r\n  (Fig. 539, _D-F_, _us_). They here form only relatively small sacs\r\n  situated in the lateral parts of the primitive band which correspond\r\n  to the dorsal section of the cœlom-sacs of Orthoptera. The ventral\r\n  part is here from the very outset replaced by a mesenchym. As a\r\n  result in these forms also no cœlomic diverticula occur in the\r\n  rudiments of the extremities.\r\n\r\n  The definite body-cavity of insects arises entirely independent of\r\n  the cœlom cavities, and in fact, as Bütschli showed, through the\r\n  separation of the primitive band from the yolk (Fig. 539, _F_, _l_).\r\n  It appears bounded on the one hand by the surface of the yolk, on\r\n  the other side by the irregularly arranged mesenchym cells.\r\n  Originally we can in cross-sections distinguish three separate\r\n  cavities of the definite body-cavity (in Hydrophilus according to\r\n  Heider), a median and two larger paired lateral ones which later\r\n  fuse with each other and with wide lacunæ (_e.g._ in the appendages)\r\n  arising by the separation of the mesenchym cells. We refer the\r\n  compartments of the definite body-cavity, as in Peripatus, to the\r\n  primary body-cavity or segmentation-cavity. They are only lacunæ in\r\n  the area of the mesenchym, and throughout bear the character of a\r\n  pseudocœl.\r\n\r\n  In later stages of embryonic development the cœlom-sacs and the\r\n  definite body-cavity enter into communication with one another (Fig.\r\n  523, _A_, _us_, _lh_). (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  Then the hinder cœlom-sacs unite through the degeneration of the\r\n  transverse dissepiments which separate them. After this a fissure\r\n  opens in the median wall of the cœlomic sac, through which its\r\n  cavity unites with the definite body-cavity. In the subsequent\r\n  changes which the wall of the cœlom-sacs undergoes, these can be\r\n  recognised no longer as separate divisions of the whole body-cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _l._ Formation of organs\r\n\r\n=The nervous system.=—As we have already seen (p. 554), the rudiments of\r\nthe ventral nervous cord arise, after the gastrula invagination is\r\ncompleted, as two ectodermal thickenings situated on each side of the\r\nmedian line, the so-called primitive rolls or strips (Fig. 528, _s_),\r\nwhich extend from the centre of the procephalic lobes of the head to the\r\nlast segment, enclosing between them the single median “primitive\r\ngroove” (Fig. 539, _C_, _pr_, and _pw_).\r\n\r\nSoon after the appearance of the primitive strips, the first traces of\r\nsegmentation may be detected. The ventral cord is from the first in\r\ndirect connection and continuous with the brain. From the segmental\r\nexpansions of the primitive strip arise the ventral nervous ganglia, and\r\nfrom the intersegmental constrictions are developed the paired\r\nlongitudinal commissures.\r\n\r\nTransverse sections of the ectoderm in the region of the primitive\r\nstrips (Figs. 539, _C_, and 517) show several layers of cells. Of these\r\ncellular layers the deeper ones afterwards, by a kind of delamination,\r\nseparate from the superficial ones and form the “lateral cords,” _i.e._\r\nthe germs of the longitudinal cords of the ventral ganglionic cord.\r\nMeanwhile the primitive groove (_pr_) deepens and forms an invagination\r\nextending between the lateral cords. The cells at the bottom of this\r\ninvagination form the so-called “median cord,” and give rise to the\r\ntransverse commissures connecting the ganglia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 541.—Transverse section through the rudiment of the ventral\r\n    nervous cord of Xiphidium: _f_, fibrous mass; _m_, neuroblast cells\r\n    of the median cord; _n_{1}-n_{4}_, neuroblasts of the lateral cord;\r\n    _z_, pillar of ganglion-cells arising from the neuroblasts.—After\r\n    Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Wheeler has detected in the rudiment of the ventral cord of several\r\n  Orthoptera, on the upper surface of the lateral cords, four large\r\n  cells which he calls _neuroblasts_ (Figure 541, _n_{1}-n_{4}_), from\r\n  which cells arise by budding and become arranged in vertically\r\n  arranged layers or pillars (_z_). Graber has observed them in\r\n  Stenobothrus and Viallanes in Mantis. These neuroblasts are only\r\n  present in the inter-ganglionic region, and soon move back to the\r\n  hinder side of the transverse commissures.\r\n\r\nAt first there is a pair of ganglia to each of the 16 trunk-segments of\r\nthe embryo, but afterwards these become more or less fused together;\r\nthus those of the three gnathal segments unite to form the subœsophageal\r\nganglion of the adult, and the last abdominal ganglia are fused together\r\nand move a little anteriorly (see also pp. 227, 228).\r\n\r\n=Development of the brain.=—The supraœsophageal ganglion is due to the\r\nspreading out of the procephalic lobes. The rudiment of the brain is due\r\nto a thickening of the ectoderm on the sides of the mouth and of the\r\nforehead, this expansion of germinal brain-cells being the direct\r\ncontinuation of the primitive rolls or strips, and which finally becomes\r\ndifferentiated into the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum,\r\nas stated on p. 228.\r\n\r\nThe ganglion opticum, now regarded as a part of the compound eye, arises\r\nas an ectodermal thickening on each side of the rudimentary brain. The\r\noptic ganglion belongs exclusively to the foremost division of the brain\r\n(see also p. 227).\r\n\r\n=Development of the eyes.=—Compound eyes do not appear until the\r\nbeginning of pupal life, the single eye (ocellus) being the primitive\r\norgan of vision. The ocellus of Acilius, according to Patten, arises as\r\na pit or depression of the ectoderm (Fig. 542). The long hypodermal\r\ncells which form the walls of this pit or hollow are arranged in a\r\nsingle layer, and bear at their free ends a striated cuticular edge\r\n(_c_), while from their inner or basal end arise the fibres destined to\r\nform the common optic nerve.\r\n\r\nAt a later stage (Fig. 542, _B_), the eye-pit is closed over, the edges\r\ngrowing over and covering the deeper part of the eye. In this way there\r\narises out of the pit-like rudiment a two-layered optic cup. The outer\r\nor superficial layer (_l_) becomes in its central part the crystalline\r\nlens, while the peripheral parts form the iris. From the cuticular\r\nstriated border of these cells arise the chitinous or corneal lens. On\r\nits outer edge the superficial layer of the eye passes gradually into\r\nthe unmodified hypodermis (_h_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 542.—Two stages of development of the 5th of the six ocelli of\r\n    larva of Acilius: _c_, cuticular striated band; _cl_, germ destined\r\n    to form the corneal lens; _h_, hypodermis; _l_, crystalline-lens\r\n    layer; _n_, optic nerve; _r_, retinal germ; _sp_, vertical fissure\r\n    of the retina; _x_, the retina-cells bordering this fissure.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 543.—Two later stages of development of the same eye as in Fig.\r\n    542: _i_, iris; _m_, middle inverted layer of the eye; _r_, retina;\r\n    _sp_, vertical fissure of the retina; _st_, rods; other letters as\r\n    in Fig. 542.—This and Fig. 542 after Patten, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inner, deeper layer of the eye, which forms the contracted\r\ncup-shaped portion, appears to be the rudimentary retina (_r_). From its\r\ncuticular rod-like or fibrous edge arise the visual rods. There soon\r\narise certain peculiarities characteristic of the eye of Acilius, _i.e._\r\nthe fissure (_sp_) bordered by the horizontally situated rods of the\r\nlarge retina-cells (_x_).\r\n\r\nIn the farther developed eye (Fig. 543) there is a flattening of the\r\ncup-shaped inner edge, by which the bottom of the eye is levelled and\r\nthe little rods belonging to it stand up vertically (Fig. 543, _B_,\r\n_st_). Then the cells belonging to the edge of the retinal cup (_m_) are\r\nturned in, forming an inverted layer constituting the germs of a third\r\nlayer interpolated between the two chief layers of the eye. (Korschelt\r\nand Heider, from Patten.) Patten concludes that the structure of the\r\nretina in the larval ocelli of insects is much like that of myriopods,\r\nand that the whole eye is constructed on the same plan as that of\r\nPeripatus and most molluscs.\r\n\r\n=Intestinal canal and glands.=—The intestinal or digestive canal is\r\nprimitively divided, as already stated on p. 299, into three sections,\r\nof which the anterior and posterior are called respectively the\r\nstomodæum and proctodæum, and are invaginations of the ectoderm, forming\r\nsacs whose blind ends face the future site of the mid-intestine. The\r\nfore-intestine (stomodæum) in most cases arises earlier than the\r\nproctodæum. Its muscles are derived from the mesoderm. From the\r\nstomodæum arises at an early date an unpaired dorsal invagination out of\r\nwhich develops the ganglion frontale and the pharyngeal nerve.\r\n\r\n  The absorption of the ends of the blind sacs of the fore and hind\r\n  intestine, and opening up of the passage into the mid-intestine,\r\n  occur rather early in embryonic life. In the wasps and bees, as well\r\n  as the larva of the ant-lion, the mid-intestine remains closed at\r\n  the end, not communicating with the proctodæum, which has an\r\n  exclusively excretory function (Fig. 497).\r\n\r\nThe mid-intestine arises from two originally separate rudiments, _i.e._\r\nthe fore and hind endodermal rudiments, which at the outset stand in the\r\nmost intimate relation with the invagination of the fore and hind\r\nintestine. Originating as a simple collection of cells, so closely\r\nadjoining these invaginations that Voeltzkow, Patten, and Graber derived\r\nthem directly through outgrowths of them, they become extended by\r\nadvancing cell-multiplication until they assume a U-shaped form. The\r\nlegs of the U-shaped rudiment are in the anterior endodermal mass,\r\ndirected backwards; those in the posterior mass, on the other hand, are\r\ndirected anteriorly. These legs grow towards each other until they\r\nbecome fused together, forming two paired endodermal streaks, which pass\r\nunder the primitive band along its whole length, and are fused with it\r\nat the fore and hind ends. In these places they stand in intimate union\r\nwith the proctodeal and stomodeal invaginations.\r\n\r\nThe paired endodermal streaks belong to the lateral portions of the\r\nprimitive band. As a rule, they lie directly under the row of cœlom-sacs\r\n(Fig. 539, _F_). The dorsal wall of the primitive segments stands\r\nconsequently in intimate contact with the endodermal streaks. On this\r\nwall of the primitive segments an active cell-growth takes place, and\r\nthe cell-material produced in this way, which separates from the dorsal\r\nwall of the primitive segments, forms the outer or splanchnic layer of\r\nthe rudiment of the mid-intestine (_spm_, Figs. 539, _F_, 544, _sp_).\r\nWhat remains of the dorsal wall of the cœlom-sacs after this separation\r\njoins the genital rudiments and gives rise to the so-called terminal\r\nthread-plate (Fig. 544, _ef_). The endodermal streaks, with the\r\nsplanchnic layer lying next to them, may now be considered as the\r\nrudiments of the mid-intestine (Fig. 530, _m_, etc.). These are\r\nnoticeable in the following stages by their considerable lateral growth;\r\nthey spread out over the upper surface of the yolk, around which they\r\nfinally entirely grow (Figs. 539, _C-F_, 544, 545). This growth around\r\nthe yolk goes on in most cases in such a way as to unite the two\r\nmid-intestinal streaks in the region of the ventral median line with\r\neach other. Then afterwards their union on the dorsal side takes place\r\n(Figs. 539, _F_, 545). The yolk thus passes completely into the interior\r\nof the mid-intestine, and with it the remains of the dorsal tube or\r\ndorsal organ, when such an one is present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 544.—Cross-section through the abdominal region of a somewhat\r\n    older primitive band of _Phyllodromia germanica_: _bg_, rudiment of\r\n    the nerve-cord; _c_, remains of the cœlomic cavity; _cz_, rudiment\r\n    of the genital efferent passage; _ec_, ectoderm; _en_, endoderm;\r\n    _ef_, terminal cord-plate; _fk_, fat-body tissue; _gz_, genital\r\n    cells; _h_, rudiment of the heart; _p_, rudiment of the pericardial\r\n    cavity; _ps_, rudiment of the pericardial septum; _so_, somatic\r\n    mesoderm layer; _sp_, splanchnic mesoderm layer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The salivary glands.=—These segmentally arranged glands, which open by\r\npairs into the three gnathal segments of the head, arise as ectodermal\r\ninvaginations originally opening not into the stomodæum, but outwards on\r\nthe surface of the body; hence Korschelt and Heider suggest that they\r\nwere originally dermal glands, whose mouths became drawn into the buccal\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 545.—Cross-section through the abdominal region of an embryo of\r\n    cockroach (_P. germanica_) after the yolk has been completely\r\n    enclosed by the primitive band and the closure of the back; _s_,\r\n    tracheal stigma; other letters as in Figs. 540, 544.—This and Fig.\r\n    544 after Heymons, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 546.—Embryo of Doryphora shortly after the appearance of the\r\n    appendages, unrolled and isolated: _o_, stomodæum; _lb_, labrum;\r\n    _b^1–b^3_, three brain segments; _og^1–og^3_, three segments of the\r\n    optic ganglion; _op^1–op^3_, three segments of the optic plate;\r\n    _f^1–f^5_, five pairs of invaginations which form the tentorium,\r\n    etc.; _t^7–t^{20}_, tracheal invaginations; the two last pairs\r\n    (_t^{19}-t^{20}_) either disappear or form the openings of the\r\n    sexual ducts; _at_, antennæ; _md_, mandibles; _mx^1–mx^2_, maxillæ:\r\n    _p^1–p^3_, legs; _c_, commissure connecting the two ganglionic\r\n    thickenings (_g^4_) of the premandibular segment; _gl_, ganglia;\r\n    _mst_, middlecord thickenings; _mpg^1–mpg^3_, rudiments of three\r\n    pairs of urinary tubes; _a_, proctodæum.—After Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  For their serial arrangement, see p. 337. Korschelt and Heider state\r\n  that they would be inclined to homologize the salivary glands of\r\n  insects with those glands of myriopods opening into the\r\n  mouth-cavity, were it not that these glands in myriopods opening\r\n  into the mouth are in reality transformed nephridia originating from\r\n  the mesoderm, while the salivary glands of insects are clearly\r\n  ectodermal structures. We must, therefore, they add, leave to later\r\n  researches the question of the homology of these organs, also of\r\n  their relations to the similar glands of Peripatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 547.—Section of proctodæum of embryo locust, showing origin of\r\n    urinary tubes (_ur.t_): _ep_, epithelial or glandular layer; _m_,\r\n    cells of outer or muscular layer; _a_, section of a tube.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The urinary tubes.=—These excretory vessels arise as paired\r\nevaginations of the hind intestine or proctodæum. They are ectodermal\r\nstructures arising as lateral diverticula of the intestinal cavity (Fig.\r\n546). Figure 547 represents their mode of origin at the anterior end of\r\nthe proctodæum of a locust. It will be seen that there are 10 primary\r\ntubes. There are 150 such tubes in locusts, or 10 groups of 15 each. The\r\n15 secondary tubes probably arise from the primary ones in the manner\r\ndescribed by Hatschek for Lepidoptera (see his Taf. III, Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n  While the Malpighian tubes usually first arise as diverticula of the\r\n  proctodæum, in the Hymenoptera (Apis and Chalicodoma) they appear,\r\n  even before the completion of the proctodæum, as invaginations of\r\n  the ectoderm which at first open out on the outer surface of the\r\n  primitive band. They seem, then, in some degree, to be similar to\r\n  the tracheal rudiments, which perhaps is the reason why they have\r\n  been homologized with them, a view which we do not share, and in\r\n  which Carrière does not concur. They afterwards pass, with the\r\n  growing proctodæum, into the interior of the embryo. (Korschelt and\r\n  Heider.)\r\n\r\n=The heart.=—The dorsal vessel is first indicated, according to\r\nKorotneff, by a long string or row of cells (_cardioblasts_), which on\r\neach side border the mesodermal layer of the primitive band (Figs. 544,\r\n_h_, 548, _h_). In the advancing growth of the primitive band around the\r\nyolk, this rudiment steadily passes up more towards the dorsal side. It\r\nis in connection with the wall of the primitive segment (Figs. 544 and\r\n548), and represents the point at which the dorsal wall of the cœlom-sac\r\npasses into the lateral wall. According to Korotneff, the cardioblasts\r\narise directly through a migration out from the wall of the primitive\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\nIn Gryllotalpa the formation of the dorsal organ, which, as Korotneff\r\nstates, is in this insect nothing else than a stopper which fills up the\r\ndorsal gap of the body-wall of the embryo, is effected by the rupture of\r\nthe embryonal membranes. The serosa is drawn together to form a thick\r\nplate (Fig. 523, _A_, _rp_), and the much degenerated amnion-folds\r\n(_am_) which are laterally attached to it have moved from the edges of\r\nthe primitive streak (_*x-*y_) far towards the dorsal side (see Fig.\r\n539, _C_, which represents a similar stage). The distance between the\r\nrudiment of the amnion-fold and the lateral edge of the primitive band\r\n(_*x_, _*y_) is occupied by an epithelial lamella (_l_), in which we\r\nrecognize the earlier amnion. This lamella does not lie directly on the\r\nyolk, but is separated from it by a spacious blood-lacuna (_A_, _bs_),\r\nin which can be seen numerous blood-corpuscles which have migrated in\r\nfrom the mesoderm of the primitive band. The cardioblasts which have\r\narisen from the wall of the primitive segment (_us_) are on each side\r\narranged into the form of a furrow (_gr_), which bounds the blood sinus\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 548.—Cross-section through the abdominal part of an older\r\n    primitive band of _P. germanica_ when beginning to grow around the\r\n    yolk: _vm_, ventral longitudinal muscle; other lettering as in Fig.\r\n    545.—After Heymons, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy the continuous growth of the primitive band around the yolk, after\r\nthe resulting invagination and degeneration of the dorsal plate, the two\r\nblood-lacunæ unite together on the dorsal side into a single one (_B_,\r\n_bs_). These constitute the first cavity of the heart. The vascular\r\nfurrows (_gr_) come in contact with each other and grow together, and\r\nthe wall of the heart is thus formed. Ayers states that in Œcanthus the\r\nheart is formed in the head region only after the yolk-sac has passed\r\nentirely within the body. The venous ostia arise by two paired\r\ninvaginations of the lateral walls, forming a split at their bottom.\r\n\r\nThe rudiment of the heart stands, as we have seen, in intimate union\r\nwith the primitive segments. Out of the lateral walls of these segments,\r\nafter giving off the elements of the somatic mesoderm, arises an\r\nepithelial plate which becomes the rudiment of the pericardial septum or\r\ndorsal diaphragm (Figs. 523, _A-C_, _dd_, 544–545, _ps_). As soon as the\r\ntwo halves of the rudiments of the heart have united with each other in\r\nthe dorsal middle line, the two halves of the pericardial septum unite\r\nwith each other and form the wall to the pericardial cavity and shut it\r\noff from the rest of the body-cavity. For a long time the pericardial\r\nseptum remains in union with the wall of the heart. Afterwards, however,\r\nit separates from it (Fig. 523, _C_, _dd_). (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  The statements of other authors (Ayers, Grassi, Patten, Tichomeroff,\r\n  Carrière, Heider, Heymons, etc.) as to the mode of origin of the\r\n  heart in insects of other orders are all similar to the type\r\n  described in Gryllotalpa. The difference consists mostly in the fact\r\n  that the two large blood-lacunæ are wanting or only exist to a\r\n  slight extent. It results that the rudiment of the cavity of the\r\n  heart in the earlier stages is of slight extent and often scarcely\r\n  recognizable.\r\n\r\n  In Œcanthus (Ayers) and in Gryllotalpa, the hinder section of the\r\n  heart is the first to develop, the development advancing from behind\r\n  forward.\r\n\r\n=The blood-corpuscles.=—Blood-cells are said by Korotneff to be, in\r\nGryllotalpa, at an early period present almost everywhere between the\r\nyolk and mesoderm; they are derived, as he states, from the cells of the\r\nsomatic mesoderm layer, which has lost its connection with the other\r\nparts of the mesoderm, and fall into the body-cavity. Ayers states that\r\nthe blood-corpuscles arise from serosa nuclei which have passed into the\r\nbody-cavity, where they become more vesicular, and ultimately all of the\r\nnuclear substance goes to form from one to three spherical bodies, which\r\nare surrounded by the common membrane.\r\n\r\n“These bodies are blood-corpuscles and are free nucleoli immediately on\r\nthe rupturing of the vesicle which surrounds them.” (Ayers, Pl. 22,\r\nFigs. 1, 3, p. 250.) More recently, Schaeffer has observed in\r\ncaterpillars certain cell-complexes associated with the fat-body which\r\nhe has called blood-forming masses.\r\n\r\n=Musculature, connective tissue, fat-body.=—The muscles of various parts\r\nof the body, as well as the connective tissue, arise by histological\r\ndifferentiation from the somatic layer of the mesoderm (Fig. 523, _so_).\r\nThe fat-body originates from the same source, as shown by the researches\r\nof Kowalevsky, Grassi, and of Carrière. In Hydrophilus a dorsal band of\r\nthe fat-body passes over the digestive canal arising by direct\r\ntransformation of the wall of the cœlom-sacs. But also the other\r\nportions of the fat-body, as the fat-body lobes accompanying the\r\ntracheal system, are of undoubted mesodermal origin. Heymons’\r\nobservations on the cockroach (Phyllodromia) agree with the foregoing\r\nview. In this insect at a very early period certain cells in the wall of\r\nthe cœlom-sacs undergo a change, and may be recognized as the rudiments\r\nof what are afterwards fat-body tissues (Fig. 540, _B_ and _C_, _f_).\r\n\r\n=The reproductive organs.=—Our knowledge of the mode of development of\r\nthe genital organs is in a less satisfactory state than that of the\r\nother organs. It is now known that the rudiments of the sexual glands\r\nbelong to the mesoderm, and are developed from the wall of the\r\ncœlom-sacs. In the cockroach (Phyllodromia), the most generalized of the\r\nwinged insects, as Heymons has shown, in the earlier stages of the\r\nembryo separate genital cells are already distinguished by their\r\nhistologically different characters from the other mesodermal cells. The\r\ngenital cells are larger and show a feebly stained nucleus with a clear\r\nnucleolus. These genital cells, which are transformed normal mesodermal\r\ncells, lie originally within the mesoderm layer or on the surface of\r\nthis layer turned towards the yolk, on the edge of the segments. After\r\nthe complete formation of the cœlom-sacs we find them (Fig. 549, _gz_)\r\nin the dissepiments which separate the successive cœlom-sacs from one\r\nanother. Here new genital cells are constantly formed through the\r\ntransformation of mesoderm cells. The development of the genital cells\r\ntakes place in the 2d to the 7th abdominal segments.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the genital cells pass into the interior of the cœlom-sacs,\r\nand soon pass to the dorsal wall of the same (Fig. 540, _A_, _gz_) and\r\nenter between the cells of this wall. The cœlom-sacs (_c_) show in\r\ncross-section in this stage a triangular outline, so that we can\r\ndistinguish a dorsal, lateral, and median wall. The dorsal wall lies\r\nnext to the surface of the yolk, and afterwards gives rise by separation\r\nor splitting to the splanchnic mesoderm (Fig. 544, _sp_), while from its\r\nremains the terminal thread-plate (_ef_) originates. The lateral wall,\r\nwhich is turned towards the ectoderm of the primitive band, is\r\nintimately concerned in the formation of the somatic layer (Fig. 540,\r\n_C_, _so_) of the mesoderm. Out of what remains arises the pericardial\r\nseptum (Fig. 544, _ps_).\r\n\r\nWhen the genital cells have entered into the dorsal wall of the\r\nprimitive segments, they are already so numerous that they form a\r\ncontinuous series extending from before backward. The genital rudiment\r\nconsists, then, of a string of cells lying on each side in the dorsal\r\nwall of the primitive segments, which extend from the 2d to the 7th\r\nabdominal segments. In the formation of these strings or rows of cells\r\nnot only are the genital cells concerned, but also still\r\nundifferentiated mesoderm cells (Fig. 540, _B_, _C_), which originate\r\nfrom the dorsal wall of the cœlom-sacs and lie next to the genital\r\ncells. Some of these last tend to envelop the genital cells. We\r\ndesignate them the epithelial cells of the genital rudiments (_ep_),\r\nwhile others form a cellular cord which takes a position medial and\r\nventral to the genital cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 549.—Sagittal (longitudinal) section through the abdominal part\r\n    of a primitive band of cockroach (_Phyllodromia germanica_) after\r\n    the end of the formation of the primitive segments: 1–7, 1st to 7th\r\n    abdominal segments; from the 8th abdominal segment (8) to the last\r\n    segment (_es_) extends the inturned ventral part of the primitive\r\n    band; _am_, amnion; _c_, cœlom-sac; _d_, yolk; _gz_, genital cells,\r\n    lying partly in the dissepiments, partly in the wall or in the\r\n    cavity of the primitive segments.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the genital cells in the female arise only the egg-cells (and the\r\nnutritive cells in those forms which have such). The follicular\r\nepithelium of the egg-tube, on the other hand, also the corresponding\r\ncells of the terminal chamber, originate from the epithelial cells.\r\nPhyllodromia and Orthoptera in general, to which this description\r\napplies, show in this respect tolerably simple relations, since the\r\ngerminal or terminal compartment of the ovary in them is composed of\r\nrelatively few cells. In most other insects, and especially those which\r\nhave a great number of food-cells in the ovary, the germinal chamber\r\n(Keimfach) is extraordinarily large.\r\n\r\nThe ventral cellular cord (_cz_) develops into the proximal part of the\r\noviduct, which widens out and receives the single egg-tubes.\r\n\r\nThe cœlom-sacs in the farther course of their development, through the\r\nretrograde development of the parts extending into the appendages,\r\nthrough the development of the fat-bodies and through the delamination\r\nof the somatic and the splanchnic mesoderm layer, become greatly\r\ndiminished in size. Finally, there remains left of them only a rather\r\nsmall cavity (_c_), which is bordered on the side by the rudiment of the\r\npericardial septum (_ps_) and within by the terminal thread-plate\r\n(_ef_). The dorsally situated point where these two lamellæ pass into\r\neach other seems to stand in intimate connection with the cells of the\r\nrudiment of the heart (_h_). The cord-like genital rudiment hangs from\r\nthe terminal thread-plate as from a mesentery (Fig. 549, _gz_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 550.—Longitudinal section through the female genital rudiments of\r\n    _P. germanica_. _A_, with beginning, _B_, with farther advanced\r\n    growth of the ovarian tubes: _cz_, rudiment of the genital efferent\r\n    passage; _ef_, terminal threads; _ep_, nucleus of the epithelial\r\n    cells; _gz_, genital cells.—After Heymons, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTogether with the growth of the primitive band around the yolk, and the\r\nformation of the back, the paired rudiments of the heart gradually\r\nextend to the neighborhood of the dorsal median line, followed by the\r\ngenital rudiments which are connected with them by the terminal\r\nthread-plates. The genital rudiments advance thus to the dorsal side of\r\nthe developing mid-intestine (Fig. 545, _gz_).\r\n\r\nThe terminal thread-plate (_ef_) is at first a simple epithelial plate.\r\nSoon, however, follows an arrangement of its cells whereby they appear\r\nto be arranged in vertical rows, each one of which corresponds to a\r\ndeveloping ovarian tube. In this way the terminal thread-plate separates\r\ninto the separate terminal threads of the ovarian tubes (Fig. 550,\r\n_ef_). In this process of division the uppermost dorsal edge of the\r\nterminal thread-plate takes no part. From it afterwards grows a thread\r\nwhich extends anteriorly, which becomes the common terminal thread of\r\nall the ovarian tubes, the so-called Müller’s thread. This is originally\r\nunited with the pericardial septum, but seems in later stages to have no\r\nlonger an intimate connection with it.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the single ovarian tubes, which in Phyllodromia number\r\nabout 20, is accomplished by the extension of indentations from the\r\ndorsal side towards the ventral side of the ovarian rudiment (Fig. 550).\r\nAt the same time the epithelial cells (_ep_), which were originally\r\nsituated in part between the genital cells, become arranged in the form\r\nof an epithelium on the surface of the ovarian tubes, which soon forms\r\non its outer surface a structureless cuticular _tunica propria_. The\r\nouter peritoneal membrane of the ovary becomes formed of the cells of\r\nthe surrounding tissue of the fat-body.\r\n\r\nThe genital rudiment originally extends, as already stated, from the 2d\r\nto the 7th abdominal segment. In the last, however, the genital cells at\r\nfirst occur only sparingly, and afterwards completely disappear, so that\r\nhere the genital cord appears composed of epithelial cells only. This\r\npart is the rudiment of the oviduct proper, and forms a direct\r\ncontinuation of the above-mentioned cell-cord which is situated\r\nventralward from the genital cells, from which, as we have seen, the\r\nproximal cup-shaped section of the oviduct is formed. The hinder section\r\nof the oviduct turns down ventrally in order to unite at the boundary\r\nbetween the 7th and 8th abdominal segments with the hypodermis. The\r\nrudiment of the oviduct originally forms a solid strand of cells.\r\nAfterwards a cavity is formed by the separation of the cells.\r\n\r\n  In later stages there is a considerable shortening of the genital\r\n  rudiment, so that it occupies a smaller number of abdominal segments\r\n  than at first. At the same time the single ovarian tubes pass out of\r\n  their originally vertical position into one more horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe paired connections of the rudiments of the oviducts with the\r\nhypodermis of the intersegmental furrow between the 7th and 8th\r\nabdominal segments reminds us of the conditions in the Ephemeridæ. This\r\nis the primitive condition in insects. In the female of Phyllodromia\r\nthere is developed during larval life, from an ectodermal invagination,\r\nan unpaired terminal section of the genital passage, which becomes the\r\ngenital pouch in which the egg-case (oötheca) is held. This genital\r\npouch is formed, as Haase has already proved, by the withdrawal of the\r\nchitinous ventral plate of the 8th and 9th abdominal segment by\r\ninvagination into the interior of the body.\r\n\r\nThe development of the efferent passages has been investigated by\r\nNusbaum in the cockroach (Periplaneta) and in the Pediculina. He found\r\nthat only the vasa deferentia and the oviducts arise from the hinder\r\ncord of the germs of the sexual glands, that is, out of the mesodermal\r\nrudiments, while the other parts of the sexual efferent apparatus\r\n(uterus, vagina, receptaculum seminis, ejaculatory duct, penis, and all\r\nthe accessory glands) develop from the integumental epithelium and are\r\nof ectodermal origin. In fact, the unpaired parts (uterus, penis,\r\nreceptaculum seminis, unpaired glands) have developed from paired\r\nrudiments, being outgrowths of the hypodermis. The hinder portions of\r\nthe rudiments of the sexual glands approach these hypodermal growths and\r\nfuse with them. Through a median fusion of the paired hypodermal growths\r\narise the germs of the unpaired organs. These observations are in\r\ncomplete agreement with the results at which Palmén arrived by\r\nanatomical investigation (see p. 492).\r\n\r\nFrom the agreement of the position of the sexual openings in\r\nPhyllodromia with the conditions observed in the Ephemeridæ, with which\r\nthe Perlidæ also agree, we conclude that in the entire group of insects\r\nan opening between the 7th and 8th abdominal segments is the primitive\r\ncondition, and that only by a secondary shifting has a more posterior\r\nposition of the opening (in many forms) been brought about. In this\r\ncategory we must certainly include the Thysanura, in which the sexual\r\nopening is single and situated between the 8th and 9th abdominal\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n=Development of the male germinal glands.=—These rudiments arise in\r\nexactly the same manner as those of the female. Sexual differentiation\r\ntakes place in the later embryonic stages. We then notice that in the\r\nmale four masses of genital cells become surrounded by epithelial cells.\r\nThese masses, which form the germs of the four testicular follicles of\r\nPhyllodromia, stand in intimate union with the rudiment of the vas\r\ndeferens, and in the later stages move in connection with the latter,\r\naway from and behind the original genital rudiment. There remains, then,\r\nwith the terminal thread-plate a remnant of the genital rudiment, which,\r\naccording to Heymons, forms the female part of the original\r\nhermaphroditic genital rudiment, and in special cases may develop even\r\ninto rudimentary egg-tubes and eggs. The rudimentary organ arising out\r\nof this genital rudiment may also be demonstrated in the adult male of\r\nPhyllodromia.\r\n\r\nIn the female the oviduct arises directly out of the originally\r\nestablished efferent passage. In the male, on the contrary, it is not,\r\nalong its whole length, transformed into the vas deferens, but its\r\ndistal terminal portion degenerates and is replaced by a newly formed\r\nterminal portion of the vas deferens, which then unites with the\r\nectodermal ductus ejaculatorius. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  On reviewing the facts as to the origin of the sexual organs, as in\r\n  Phyllodromia,[84] as just described, it will be seen that they\r\n  afford proof that in the derivation of the genital cells from the\r\n  epithelial cells of the cœlom-sacs, there is a direct agreement with\r\n  the annelids. In the later development of the paired genital glands,\r\n  and of an efferent passage standing in direct union with the glands\r\n  themselves, there is a certain agreement with the conditions in\r\n  Peripatus. In the first place, the dorsal position of the genital\r\n  glands is the same in the two groups. On the other hand, the genital\r\n  glands of Peripatus, according to Sedgwick, are formed by direct\r\n  fusion of the successive cœlom-sacs (and a similar point of view has\r\n  been taken by Heathcote for the myriopods), hence it results that in\r\n  Peripatus the genital cavities arise out of the cœlom-cavities. In\r\n  the insects, on the other hand, the genital rudiment lies, to be\r\n  sure, in the wall of the cœlom-sac, but the genital cavity (lumen of\r\n  the oviducts) in them arises separately from the cœlom-sacs, while\r\n  the cœlom-cavities finally become a small part of the definite\r\n  body-cavity. We must consider the conditions in Peripatus and the\r\n  myriopods as the more primitive, directly pointing to the annelids;\r\n  on the other hand, those of the insects as derived and secondary.\r\n\r\n  If we attempt to homologize the sexual efferent passages of insects\r\n  with those of Peripatus, we are compelled to refer them to a\r\n  modified pair of nephridia, and the origin of the latter (Peripatus)\r\n  from the mesoderm agrees with that of insects. In general, however,\r\n  in the development of the sexual outlets of insects, there are no\r\n  characters which can be regarded as favorable to such a view. We\r\n  must here accept the fact that the mode of development is secondary.\r\n\r\n  Mention should be specially made of the fact we owe to Heymons, that\r\n  in the genital rudiment of Phyllodromia the genital cells and\r\n  epithelial cells can be distinguished from each other from the very\r\n  beginning. This fact does not favor the generally accepted view that\r\n  the follicle-cells and egg-cells arise through a later\r\n  differentiation from one and the same kind of cell. From their first\r\n  origin, indeed, in Phyllodromia, both kinds of cells may be referred\r\n  to the same source.\r\n\r\n  The mode of origin of the genital rudiments in Diptera and Aphides\r\n  deserve special mention. In these groups the sexual germs are\r\n  present in very early stages of life. This certainly in part is the\r\n  result of the parthenogenetic and pædogenetic mode of reproduction\r\n  in the two groups, which leads to an early differentiation of the\r\n  sexual germs.\r\n\r\n  In the Diptera the first germs of the genital glands are represented\r\n  by the polar cells (Fig. 551, _pz_). In the asexual developing eggs\r\n  of the oviparous Cecidomyia larva, before the formation of the\r\n  blastoderm, there separates from the hinder pole (_D_) a rather\r\n  large cell rich in granules, which soon divides into two and\r\n  afterwards four polar cells. After the completion of the blastoderm\r\n  these polar cells then pass in among the blastoderm cells (_G_) and\r\n  into the interior of the embryo, where they are in later stages\r\n  symmetrically arranged in two groups, and, enveloped by the cells of\r\n  surrounding tissues, transformed into the genital rudiments.\r\n  (Metschnikoff.)\r\n\r\n  In Chironomus (Fig. 552, _p_), according to Balbiani, two polar\r\n  cells almost simultaneously separate from the hinder pole of the\r\n  egg, which, by division, form a group of four and eight cells.\r\n  Exactly as in the case in Cecidomyia, these cells are taken within\r\n  the embryo, where they lie divided into two groups on each side of\r\n  the proctodæum. In all the young, freshly hatched larvæ; these two\r\n  spindle-shaped groups, whose cells soon increase in number, may be\r\n  seen situated dorsally on the side of the heart, enveloped by a\r\n  clear cellular membrane which ends before and behind in a\r\n  ligament-like terminal thread. The anterior terminal thread is the\r\n  rudiment of the so-called Müller’s thread. The thread at the\r\n  posterior end is the rudiment of the paired efferent passage of the\r\n  genital glands. Through a division of the cells lying in the\r\n  interior of the rudiments of the ovaries, there results the\r\n  formation of a rosette-shaped group of cells which corresponds to\r\n  the contents of an ovarian tube. With this view of Balbiani the\r\n  later observations of Ritter agree.\r\n\r\n  As in the Diptera, so in the Aphides, the first germs of the genital\r\n  organs are differentiated very early in life. In the early stage in\r\n  which through an invagination from the hinder pole of the egg the\r\n  first rudiment of the amnion-cavity is formed, a group of cells\r\n  becomes separated from the wall of this invagination before the\r\n  formation of the lower layer, which at this time lies as an unpaired\r\n  roundish mass within the embryo. This group of cells, according to\r\n  Balbiani and Witlaczil, has arisen by division of a single cell.\r\n  Afterwards it becomes horseshoe-shaped and divides into a number of\r\n  roundish masses of cells, which are arranged in similar numbers on\r\n  each side of the median plane of the body, and form the rudiments of\r\n  the terminal fan (Endfächer). They are covered by an epithelial\r\n  envelope which passes anteriorly into the terminal threads,\r\n  posteriorly into the efferent passage. The origin of this epithelial\r\n  case is unknown. The efferent passages of the separate ovarian tubes\r\n  are united into a common oviduct, and this fuses with an unpaired\r\n  ectodermal invagination lying under the hind intestine from which\r\n  the accessory sexual organs are formed. (Korschelt and Heider from\r\n  Metschnikoff, Witlaczil, Will.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 551.—First developmental stages of the parthenogenetic eggs of\r\n    the larva of Cecidomyia: _b_, peripheral protoplasmic layer\r\n    (Keimhautblastem); _bl_, blastoderm; _d_, central yolk; _f_,\r\n    division-nuclei; _n_, nutritive cell (“corpus luteum”) about to\r\n    break up; _pz_, polar cells.—After Metschnikoff, from Korschelt\r\n    and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In the Hymenoptera Ganin has observed in the embryo of Platygaster\r\n  the rudiments of the sexual glands in the form of two rounded masses\r\n  situated near the posterior intestine and apparently derived from\r\n  the same blastems or buds as the latter.\r\n\r\n  Uljanin studied these organs in the larva of the honey-bee. They are\r\n  two reniform bodies in the middle of which will soon appear the\r\n  ovarian tubes. They also give birth to the internal parts of the\r\n  excretory ducts, while the external part of the genital tube, as\r\n  also the accessory glands which are connected with it, are derived\r\n  by an invagination of the hypodermis at the surface of the\r\n  penultimate segment.\r\n\r\n  Dohrn observed in the larva of ants the rudiments of the ovaries in\r\n  the form of two pyriform masses, each with eight prolongations which\r\n  he regarded as young ovarian tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 552.—Three longitudinal sections through the embryo of\r\n    Chironomus. In _A_, the blastoderm (_bl_) is beginning to form,\r\n    the polar cells (_p_) outside of it; in _B_, the polar cells have\r\n    pressed in between the blastoderm cells; in _C_, they lie in the\r\n    interior of the embryo: _b_, protoplasmic layer (Keimhautblast);\r\n    _d_, yolk; _k_, nucleus of the forming blastoderm.—After Ritter,\r\n    from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In Encyrtus Bugnion observed the rudiments of the sexual glands in\r\n  the middle of the larval period; they were rounded and with no\r\n  apparent connection with the neighboring organs. Afterwards these\r\n  rudiments elongated, approached nearer to the ventral surface, and\r\n  placed themselves in relation with some small cell-groups which\r\n  appeared under the rectum, and seemed destined to form the efferent\r\n  canal (vas deferens) and accessory glands of the genital organs. He\r\n  thought the sex could be recognized in the second half of larval\r\n  life, the male gland being distinguished by its rounded shape and\r\n  smaller size; the ovary by its oval form and larger size. In larvæ\r\n  ready to be transformed the testis formed a cellular mass enveloped\r\n  by a cuticle, and at its hinder end prolonged into an epithelial\r\n  cord, which is undoubtedly the vas deferens. The ovary had a similar\r\n  envelope, and from its cellular mass arose epithelial cords which\r\n  were destined to become the ovarian tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _m._ Length of embryonic life\r\n\r\nThe duration of embryonic life varies greatly in different insects. The\r\nembryo of the blow-fly is fully developed in less than 24 hours, that of\r\nthe house-fly in 24 hours. In the locusts and tree-cricket the embryos\r\nbegin to develop at the end of the summer, continuing to grow until the\r\ncool weather of autumn, when growth is arrested, the later stages being\r\nfinished in the latter part of the spring. It is so, likewise, with the\r\nembryos of many moths and other insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _n._ The process of hatching\r\n\r\nThis has been observed only in a few cases, and careful observations as\r\nto the exact manner in which the embryo breaks the egg-shell and frees\r\nitself from the amnion are much needed. Also the rapid changes of form\r\nfrom that of the embryo within the egg-shell, and that which it\r\nimmediately assumes after breaking forth from the shell and membranes,\r\nhave yet to be observed; for these will undoubtedly be found to have\r\nspecial phylogenetic significance. Indeed, the phylogenetic importance\r\nof the latest embryonic changes in insects just entering on the nymph or\r\nthe larval stages is very great, though little attention has as yet been\r\nbestowed upon the matter.\r\n\r\nAs regards the changes at the time of hatching, Wheeler tells us that\r\nthe cockroach (Phyllodromia), shortly after leaving its narrow place in\r\nthe egg-capsule, undergoes a peculiar change in shape. Before hatching,\r\nand when confined in the egg-shell, the body is about one-third as wide\r\nas thick; but soon after breaking out of the chorion its body is much\r\nflattened, its dorso-ventral diameter being only about a third as great\r\nas its greatest breadth. This shows that the flattened shape of the body\r\nof cockroaches, which adapts them for their life under bark and stones,\r\nis a very late inheritance, and that these insects have descended from\r\nthose with more cylindrical bodies. The end of the body, also, which in\r\nthe egg is bent underneath the abdomen, is, after hatching, bent\r\ndorsally, as indicated by the anal stylets, which now point directly\r\nupwards and outwards. The spines and claws are developed shortly before\r\nhatching. In the Locustidæ (Xiphidium, etc.) Wheeler has observed that\r\nthe pleuropodia, or 1st pair of abdominal temporary embryonic\r\nappendages, are shed during hatching. All the other embryonic appendages\r\nhave also disappeared, except those which persist and have rapidly\r\nbecome modified to form the cercopods, or the ovipositor.\r\n\r\nIn locusts, as we have observed[85] in the case of _Melanoplus spretus_,\r\nthe egg-shell bursts open at the head end, when the nymph, immediately\r\nafter extricating itself from the egg, casts off a thin pellicle (the\r\namnion), as we have also noticed in the case of the larvæ of the flea,\r\ncurrant saw-fly, and other insects. Before the amnion is cast off, the\r\nyoung nymph is almost motionless, but by slight movements of the body\r\ndraws itself, in about five minutes, out of the amnion. The exact\r\nprocess of extraction is as follows: While it lies motionless, it puffs\r\nout the thin, loose skin connecting the back of the head with the front\r\nedge of the prothorax. The distention of this part probably ruptures the\r\nskin, which slips over the head, the body meanwhile curved over until\r\nthe skin is drawn back from the head; when the latter is thrown back, it\r\nwithdraws its antennæ and legs, and the skin is in a second of time\r\npushed back to near the end of the abdomen; finally, it draws its hind\r\ntarsi out of the skin, and in a moment or two more the young locust\r\nfrees itself, kicks away the cast skin, which resembles a little white\r\ncrumpled pellet, and which has also been compared to a diminutive\r\nmushroom, and walks actively off,—sometimes, however, with the cast skin\r\nadhering to the end of the abdomen. Before the shedding of the amnion\r\nthe body and legs are soft and flabby; immediately after, it walks\r\nfirmly on its legs. All the eggs hatched—at least one or more\r\nhundreds—at about the same time, _i.e._ before 11 A.M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 553.—Locust just before the amnion is cast, enlarged.—Emerton\r\n    _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe nymph of _Stagmomantis carolina_ also sheds an amnion-skin, like\r\nthat of the locust; but the embryo before casting it off is much\r\nelongated, and probably, like the European _Mantis religiosa_, the\r\ncurious elongated embryos have the same singular habit of suspending\r\nthemselves by threads, as shown in Fig. 554.\r\n\r\n  The account by Pagenstecher of the first ecdysis of the European\r\n  Mantis was so extraordinary that we asked Professor Cockerell to\r\n  collect the eggs of our Stagmomantis in New Mexico and send them to\r\n  us. This he has kindly done, writing that he can “hardly recognize a\r\n  true moult, since all that is cast off is the egg-membrane. In\r\n  short, Pagenstecher’s account must be not a little fanciful, unless\r\n  our insect differs very much in its development from _Mantis\r\n  religiosa_. The main change is that after leaving the egg the thorax\r\n  enormously elongates, producing a bulging out, and thrusting the\r\n  head forward.” Our observations on the alcoholic specimens fully\r\n  corroborate Cockerell’s conclusions. Pagenstecher’s figure of the\r\n  embryo appears to be inaccurate. Sharp states that the hatching\r\n  nymphs remain suspended for some days until the “first change of\r\n  skin is effected.” This so-called “skin” is evidently the amnion.\r\n\r\nThe 17–year Cicada, after hatching, is enveloped by the amnion, from\r\nwhich it soon extricates itself, and then drops deliberately to the\r\nground, “its specific gravity being so insignificant that it falls\r\nthrough the air as gently and as softly as does a feather.” (Riley.)\r\n\r\nOther insects, as caterpillars, have room enough to turn around within\r\ntheir shell and to eat their way through the walls of the chorion.\r\n\r\nThe meat-fly, as we have observed, hatches in the following manner. The\r\nembryo moves to and fro, the body twisting until the exochorion is\r\nruptured; the egg-shell splits longitudinally, and in one or two seconds\r\nthe larva pushes its way out through the anterior end, and in a second\r\nor two more extricates itself from the shell. The latter scarcely\r\nchanges its form, and the larva slips out, leaving the amnion within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 554.—Egg-case of Mantis with young escaping: _A_, the case with\r\n    young in their position of suspension. _B_, cerci magnified, showing\r\n    the suspensory threads.—After Brongniart, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a fossorial wasp, _Specius speciosus_, which carries\r\nCicadæ into its burrow, laying an elongated egg on the body under the\r\nmedian thigh of its victim, the larva on hatching, Riley states, “does\r\nnot emerge from the skin of the egg, but merely protrudes its head and\r\nbegins at once to draw nourishment from between the sternal sutures of\r\nthe Cicada.”\r\n\r\n=The hatching spines.=—Animals belonging to quite distinct classes are\r\nprovided late in embryonic life with hard knobs or spines, which are\r\ntemporary structures for the purpose of breaking or cutting open the\r\negg-shell, when it is too thick and solid to be ruptured by the\r\nmovements of the embryo. The embryos of certain lizards, turtles, the\r\nblind worm and some snakes, of the crocodile, and even birds, as well as\r\nthe duckbill and Echidna, are provided with them, always occurring, so\r\nfar as we are aware, on the end of the upper jaw. In the Arthropoda\r\nsimilar structures have thus far only been met with in myriopods and\r\ninsects, though an analogous structure on the cephalothorax of the\r\nembryo of phalangids has been observed by Balbiani. Metschnikoff\r\ndescribes and figures a low conical spine serving this purpose situated\r\non the embryonal cuticle over the head of the advanced embryo of\r\nStrongylosoma, and one on the 3d pair of mouth-parts of Geophilus.\r\n\r\nIn the winged insects, the embryo of Forficula is said by Heymons to\r\nbear a single spine between the eyes, which serves as an egg-tooth. The\r\nembryo of the Hemerobiidæ, according to Hagen, “opens the egg with an\r\negg-burster like a saw.” (Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., xv, p. 247.)\r\nRiley states that the egg-burster, or _ruptor ovi_, as he calls it, of\r\n_Corydalus cornutus_, has “the form of the common immature mushroom,”\r\nand he adds that it is a part of the amnion, being “easily perceived on\r\nthe end of the vacated shell.” Wheeler has observed three pairs of\r\nbroad-based chitinous “hatching spines” used by Doryphora in rupturing\r\nits embryonic envelopes, and which are secreted by pyramidal thickenings\r\nof the hypodermis (Figs. 555, 556).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 555.—The three pairs of hatching spines (_hsp_) on the late\r\n    embryo of Doryphora.—After Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 556.—Rudiment of the hatching spine: _eb_, being a thickening of\r\n    the ectoderm (_ec_) in embryo Doryphora after formation of the\r\n    heart; _s_, serosa.—After Wheeler.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 557.—Head of freshly hatched larva of _Pulex canis_: _eb_,\r\n    hatching spine; _ant_, antennæ; _md_, mandible; _mx_, maxilla;\r\n    _mx′_, 2d maxilla; _lbr_, labrum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe hatching spine of _Pulex canis_ (Fig. 557) is a thin vertical plate,\r\nlike the edge of a knife, situated in the median line of the head very\r\nnear the posterior end, and is somewhat cultriform, the upper edge\r\nslightly hollow, and turned up a little at the anterior end. Though we\r\ndid not see it working, it is situated at just the point on the head\r\nwhere it would come in contact with the egg-shell, and it was evident\r\nthat the larva, by moving its head back and forth, would produce a\r\nslight split in the chorion and cause it to burst asunder. Later on in\r\nlarval life it disappears, probably at the first moult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LITERATURE ON EMBRYOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Koelliker, Albert.= Observationes de prima insectorum genesi, etc.\r\n    Turici, 1842, pp. 29, 3 Pls.\r\n\r\n  =Rathke, H.= Zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der Maulwurfsgrille\r\n    (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_).

The transformations of the more\r\nspecialized orders of insects involve wonderful changes of form, which\r\nare only paralleled in other types of animals by the metamorphoses of\r\nthe echinoderms, of certain worms, and of the Crustacea, as well as by\r\nthose of the frog. An insect, such as a butterfly or bee, during its\r\npost-embryonic life lives, so to speak, three different lives, having\r\ndistinct bodily structures and existing under quite dissimilar\r\nsurroundings and habits; so that a caterpillar is practically a\r\ndifferent animal from the pupa, and the latter from the imago, with\r\ndifferent organs, the appendages and other structures being so modified\r\nas to be, so far as regards their functions, radically different. These\r\nchanges of functions or of habits have also been plainly enough the\r\nexciting cause of the divergency in structure of what fundamentally is\r\none and the same organ, the change having been brought about by\r\nadaptation of the same organs to quite different uses.\r\n\r\nThe changes are not only observable in the body and its appendages, but\r\nalso in the internal organs, and consequently are both structural and\r\nphysiological. The term _larva_, as applied to the first stage of\r\nanimals, is a very variable and indefinite one, that of insects in\r\ngeneral being a much more highly organized animal than the larva of a\r\nworm, starfish, or crustacean.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _a._ The nymph as distinguished from the larval stage\r\n\r\nAs there is no marked difference between the different stages of the\r\nyoung in the insects with an incomplete metamorphosis (Heterometabola),\r\nthe chief difference being the possession of the rudiments of wings and\r\nthe absence of a resting stage, the terms _larva_ and _pupa_ are in\r\nreality scarcely applicable to them, and we much prefer the term\r\n_nymph_, first proposed by Lamarck for the active “pupa” of Orthoptera,\r\nHemiptera, the Odonata and Ephemeridæ, and adopted in part by many.\r\nIndeed, in the more generalized and older orders, the larval and pupal\r\nstages are not differentiated, though the term _larval_, in its general\r\nsense, will probably always be used; just as we speak of the larval\r\nstages of worms, echinoderms, or Crustacea.\r\n\r\n  Eaton in his elaborate work on the Ephemeridæ employs the term\r\n  _nymph_ to designate all the aquatic or early stages in the\r\n  development of the young after hatching, and he urges that the\r\n  old-fashioned usage of _larva_ and _pupa_ seem scarcely worth\r\n  retention. “Nymphs are young which live an active life, quitting the\r\n  egg at a tolerably advanced stage of morphological development and\r\n  having the mouth-parts formed after the same main type of\r\n  construction as those of the adult insect.” The word _nymph_ is used\r\n  in the same sense by McLachlan, and by Cabot. Calvert also applies\r\n  the term _nymph_ “to the stage of odonate existence between the egg\r\n  and the transformation into the imago.” On the other hand, Brauer\r\n  applies the term _nymph_ to the pupa of holometabolous insects. For\r\n  larval Hyatt proposes the term _nepionic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _b._ Stages or stadia of metamorphosis\r\n\r\nThe intervals or periods between the moults or ecdyses of caterpillars\r\nand other eruciform larvæ are called stages or _stadia_; thus, as most\r\ncaterpillars moult four times, we have five stages or stadia, or stage\r\n(stadium) I to V. As observed by Sharp, there is, unfortunately, no term\r\nin general use to express the form of the insect at the various stadia;\r\n“entomologists say, ‘the form assumed at the first moult,’ and so on.”\r\nHence he adopts a term suggested by Fischer,[86] and calls the insect as\r\nit appears after leaving the egg the first _instar_, and what it is\r\nafter the first moult the second instar, and so on; hence the pupa, or\r\nchrysalis, which assumed that condition after moulting five times would\r\nbe the sixth instar, and the butterfly itself would be the seventh\r\ninstar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _c._ Ametabolous and metabolous stages\r\n\r\nIn the Synaptera development is direct, the young differing neither in\r\nform, structure, or habits from the adult. Hence they are said to be\r\n_ametabolous_. Since there is an absence of even a tendency to a partial\r\nmetamorphosis, it is evident that the insects have not inherited a\r\ntendency to undergo a transformation, but that it is an adaptation\r\ninduced in the hexapod type after the first winged insects appeared, and\r\nwhich became more marked in the more specialized insects and at a period\r\ncomparatively late in geological history, _i.e._ perhaps at or soon\r\nafter the beginning of the Carboniferous period.[87]\r\n\r\nThe transformations of the pterygote insects vary greatly in degree, and\r\nit is difficult to draw the line between the grades. Those in which the\r\nadults differ from the freshly hatched young only or mainly in having\r\nwings are generally said to have an incomplete or gradual metamorphosis.\r\nThere is no inactive, resting, or pupal stage, and the wings are\r\nacquired only after successive moults. Insects with an incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis are the Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Platyptera (Mallophaga,\r\nPlecoptera, Corrodentia, Embidæ), Ephemeridæ, Odonata, Thysanoptera, and\r\nHemiptera, with the exception of the male Coccidæ, in which there is a\r\nresting or sub-nymph stage. As regards the number of moults in the\r\nSynaptera, Grassi states that in Campodea there is a single fragmentary\r\necdysis, while Sommers tells us that _Macrotoma plumbea_ sheds its skin\r\nthroughout life, even after attaining its full size.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the partial metamorphosis of the hemimetabolous insects\r\nwe may select that of the locust, in which there are five moults and six\r\nstages (instars), as seen in Fig. 558, five of which are nymphal. In the\r\nfirst two stages there are no rudiments of wings, these appearing after\r\nthe second moult. Besides the acquisition of wings there are slight\r\ndifferences after each moult, both in structure and color, besides size,\r\nso that we may always recognize the comparative age and the particular\r\nstage of growth of any individual.[88]\r\n\r\n  We have watched the development of _Melanoplus spretus_ from the egg\r\n  to the imago, and examined thousands of specimens which show the six\r\n  stages. On the other hand, European authors differ as to whether\r\n  there are three, four, or five moults in the migratory locust.[89]\r\n  It is not improbable that, as is the case with many other insects,\r\n  the number of moults may vary according to the temperature and food,\r\n  variation in these agencies causing either retardation or rapidity\r\n  in development.\r\n\r\nThose with a complete metamorphosis are said to be _metabolous_ or\r\n_holometabolous_. (Lang.)\r\n\r\nLeach[90] in 1815 gave the name of Ametabola to insects without, and\r\nMetabola to insects with a metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 558.—Partial metamorphosis of _Melanoplus femur-rubrum_, showing\r\n    the five nymph stages, and the gradual growth of the wings, which\r\n    are first visible externally in 3, 3_b_, 3_c_.—Emerton _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Latreille (1831) called insects with an incomplete metamorphosis\r\n  _homotenous_ (which means similar to the end of life), and those\r\n  with a complete metamorphosis, _polymorphous_. For the different\r\n  degrees of metamorphosis of insects he employed two terms: for the\r\n  incomplete degree, _metamorphosis dimidia_, and for the total or\r\n  pupal, _metamorphosis perfecta_.\r\n\r\n  Westwood in his Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects\r\n  (1839), taking into account the relation of the larva with the\r\n  imago, divided insects into two divisions: the _Heteromorpha_, or\r\n  those in which there is no resemblance between the parent and its\r\n  offspring, and _Homomorpha_, in which the larva resembles the imago,\r\n  except in the absence of wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 559.—Manometabolous metamorphosis of the cockroach (_Phyllodromia\r\n    germanica_) with its four nymphal stadia _a-d_; _e_, _h_, adult;\r\n    _f_, female with egg-case; _g_, egg-case.—From Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the degree of metamorphosis, insects have been\r\ndivided into _Heterometabola_ and _Metabola_.\r\n\r\nI. _Heterometabola._—This group may be divided as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Manometabola_,[91] embracing those forms with a slight or gradual\r\nmetamorphosis, but which are active in all the stages, without any\r\nresting stage. The orders passing through this degree of metamorphosis\r\nare the following: Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Platyptera, Thysanoptera, and\r\nHemiptera (Coccidæ excepted).\r\n\r\nIn all these groups, the only external differences of importance between\r\nthe freshly hatched nymph and the adult is the presence of wings. The\r\nchief difference internally is the complete development of the sexual\r\nglands.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, however, that in the last nymph stage of the\r\nThysanoptera the articulations of the limbs are enveloped by a membrane\r\nand the wings enclosed in short fixed sheaths; the antennæ are turned\r\nback on the head, and the insect, though it moves about, is much more\r\nsluggish than in the other state. (Haliday.) Hence here we have a close\r\napproach to the following degree.\r\n\r\n2. _Heremetabola_,[92] including those forms with a gradual though\r\nslight or incomplete metamorphosis, but with a quiescent or resting\r\nstage at the close of the nymph life. Lang has emphasized this stage,\r\ncalling attention to the fact that the fore legs of the nymph of the\r\n17–year Cicada, which lives underground on the roots of trees, are thick\r\nand adapted for digging. The transition from the nymph to the winged\r\nadult is signalized by the decided change in form of the fore legs, as\r\nwell as by the acquisition of the wings. “The last larval stage is,\r\nthen, what is called _quiescent_, _i.e._ the organization of the imago\r\ndevelops within the chrysalis at the expense of the accumulated reserve\r\nmaterial.” (Lang.) There seems to be a resting stage, when the insect\r\ndoes not perhaps suck the sap from the roots, and awaits in its chamber\r\nits approaching change to the imago; but we should scarcely apply the\r\nterm _pupa_ to this stage, though the antennæ of the freshly hatched\r\nlarva are larger and longer than in the fully grown nymph and are\r\ndistinctly 8–jointed.\r\n\r\n3. _Hemimetabola._—In this division, so named by Brauer, the changes are\r\nmore marked, though there is no truly inactive pupa-like stage. The\r\norders are Perlaria (Plecoptera), Odonata, and Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ).\r\nThe freshly hatched nymphs of these three groups are much alike in\r\nshape, that of Perlidæ, and indeed most of the Platyptera, being more\r\ngeneralized, unless we except that of Chloëon; all closely recall\r\nCampodea, and are therefore in the Campodea-stage. These nymphs are\r\nindeed more generalized than the freshly hatched nymph of Blattidæ, or\r\nany other of the orders mentioned except the Platyptera, to which\r\nperlids belong. They all have feet, and the body is more or less\r\nflattened. (Fig. 560.)\r\n\r\nII. _Holometabola._—In this division we have for the first time a true\r\nlarva, and a pupa stage as distinguished from the imago. Moreover, the\r\ninsect at each stage is distinguished by radical differences in form,\r\nsurroundings, and in the nature of the food, while the pupa is inactive,\r\nusually immovable, and incapable of taking any food, and is often\r\nprotected by a cocoon spun by the larva. The holometabolous orders are\r\nthe Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Mecoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera,\r\nSiphonaptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n  As we have among worms, echinoderms, and Crustacea certain\r\n  exceptional species in a metamorphic group whose metamorphosis is\r\n  suppressed, their development being direct, so there is in pterygote\r\n  insects, though in a very much less degree, cases of direct\r\n  development. In the wingless cockroaches such as Pseudoglomeris,\r\n  etc., of the tribe of Periphæriides, in some of which, however, the\r\n  males are winged, and in the Hemiptera, occur wingless forms such as\r\n  the lice and bed-bug. The Mallophaga are all wingless, while certain\r\n  Dermaptera (Chelidura, Anisolabis) are also apterous. The absence of\r\n  wings in such cases is due to disuse from parasitism, or to a life\r\n  under stones or in cracks and fissures, where the insects are driven\r\n  to avoid their enemies, and hence do not need wings. The growth of\r\n  wings and consequently the development of a metamorphosis is\r\n  suppressed, so that, as Lang says, “in contrast to the original\r\n  ametabola of the Apterygota, we have here an _acquired ametabola_.”\r\n\r\n  It is rare that, after the rudiments of wings have once appeared in\r\n  the very young, they should disappear in the late nymph stage; this\r\n  is, however, said by Walsh to be the case with the Ephemerid Bætisca\r\n  (Fig. 440). This is a case of retardation in an acquired\r\n  ametabolesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LARVA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _larva_ is peculiarly applicable to the young of the\r\nholometabolous orders. The name (Latin, _larva_, a mask) was first given\r\nto the caterpillar because it was thought by the ancients to mask the\r\nform of the perfect insect. Swammerdam supposed that the larva contained\r\nwithin itself “the germ of the future butterfly, enclosed in what will\r\nbe the case of the pupa, which is itself included in three or more\r\nskins, one over the other, that will successively cover the larva.” What\r\nled to his conception of the nature of these changes was probably his\r\nobservations on the semitransparent larva of the gnat, in which the body\r\nand limbs of the pupa can be partially seen; for Weismann has shown that\r\nthe great Dutch observer’s belief that the pupal and imaginal skins were\r\nin reality already concealed under that of the larva is partially\r\nfounded in fact. Swammerdam states: “I can point out in the larva all\r\nthe limbs of the future nymph, or Culex, concealed beneath the skin,”\r\nand he also observed beneath the skin of the larvæ of bees, just before\r\npupating, the antennæ, mouth-parts, wings, and limbs of the adult. But,\r\nas we shall see farther on, the discovery by Weismann in the larva of\r\nthe germs of the imago has completely changed our notions as to the\r\nnature of metamorphosis, and revolutionized our knowledge of the\r\nfundamental processes concerned in the change from larva to pupa, and\r\nfrom pupa to imago.\r\n\r\nNot only are the larvæ of each order of insects characteristic in form,\r\nso that the grub or larva of beetles is readily distinguished from those\r\nof other orders, or the maggot of flies from the apodous larva of wasps\r\nand bees, but within the limits of the larger orders there is great\r\ndiversity of larval forms, showing that they are the result of\r\nadaptation to their surroundings. This is especially the case with the\r\nlarvæ of the Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\nIn general, the larvæ of insects may be divided into two types,—the\r\n_Campodea-form_, or campodeoid, sometimes called thysanuriform, and the\r\n_eruciform_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _a._ The Campodea-form type of larva\r\n\r\nThis is the most primitive and generalized type of larva (Fig. 560). A\r\nCampodeoid larva is one nearest in general shape to Campodea, the form\r\nwhich we have seen to be the nearest allied to the probable ancestor of\r\nthe insects, and it also resembles the nymphs of the heterometabolous\r\ninsects, before the appearance of their rudimentary wings.\r\n\r\nBrauer, in 1869,[93] first suggested that the larvæ of a great number of\r\ninsects may be traced back to Campodea and Iapyx. The Campodea-form\r\nlarva is active, with a more or less flattened body, well developed\r\nmandibulate mouth-parts, and usually long legs. The nearest approach to\r\nthe form of Campodea is the freshly hatched nymph of cockroaches\r\n(Blattidæ), Forficula, Perlidæ, Termitidæ, Psocidæ, Embidæ, Ephemeridæ,\r\nOdonata, especially the more generalized Agrionidæ, the nymphs of\r\nHemiptera, the larvæ of certain Neuroptera, the active pedate larvæ of\r\nthe more generalized Coleoptera, such as those of Carabidæ, Cicindelidæ,\r\nDyticidæ, etc., and the first larva (instar) of Stylopidæ and Meloidæ\r\n(Fig. 560, _d_).\r\n\r\nWhile the Campodea-shape is retained throughout nymphal life, of the\r\norders above mentioned the Neuroptera and Coleoptera alone have a true\r\nresting pupal stage.\r\n\r\nIt should also be observed that great changes in the form of the nymph\r\noccur within the limits of the Orthoptera; the nymph of all the families\r\nexcept that of the Blattidæ, evidently the most generalized and\r\nprimitive, being more or less specialized, while the nymphs of the other\r\norders all vary in degree of specialization and modification. The\r\nprocess of adaptation once begun went on very rapidly, as it has in many\r\nother orders of insects, as well as in animals of other phyla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 560.—Examples of campodeoid nymphs and larvæ: _a_, Campodea; _b_,\r\n    Podura (Degeeria); _c_, Lepisma; _d_, triungulin larva of Meloë;\r\n    _e_, Perla; _f_, Forficula; _g_, Chloëon; _h_, May-fly (Palingenia);\r\n    _i_, Æschna; _j_, Atropos; _k_, Myrmeleon; _l_, Sialis; _m_,\r\n    Corydalus; _n_, Cicada.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _b._ The eruciform type of larva\r\n\r\nBrauer also sagaciously pointed out that “a larger part of the most\r\nhighly developed insects assume another larva form, which appears not\r\nonly as a later acquisition, through adaptation to certain definite\r\nconditions, but also arises as such before our eyes. The larvæ of\r\nLepidoptera, of saw-flies, and Panorpidæ show the form most distinctly,\r\nand I call this the caterpillar form (_Raupenform_). That this is not\r\nthe primitive form, but one later acquired, we see illustrated in\r\ncertain beetles. The larvæ of Meloë and of Sitaris, in their fully grown\r\nconditions, possess the caterpillar form, but the new-born larvæ of\r\nthese genera show the Campodea-form. The last form is lost as soon as\r\nthe larva begins its parasitic mode of life.... The larger part of the\r\nbeetles, the Neuroptera (in part), the bees and flies (the last with the\r\nmost degraded maggot form), possess larvæ of this second form.” In 1871\r\nwe adopted these views, giving the name _eruciform_ to this type of\r\nlarvæ, and afterwards Lubbock adopted Brauer’s views. Brauer considered\r\nthat the eruciform larva was the result of living a stationary\r\nsemi-parasitic life on plants, in carrion, or burrowing in the trunks\r\nand branches or leaves and buds of trees, where they do not have to move\r\nabout in search of their food. The change from the Campodea-form to the\r\neruciform larva is a process of degeneration and often of atrophy of the\r\nlimbs, and, in the footless forms of dipterous and hymenopterous\r\ninsects, of the gnathites, accompanied by a tendency of the body to\r\nbecome more or less cylindrical.\r\n\r\nThe first steps in the origination of the eruciform larva were\r\napparently taken in the order Neuroptera, as restricted by Brauer and by\r\nmyself, where, though the larvæ are campodeoid, there is a true resting\r\npupal stage. The most generalized larval form is perhaps that of the\r\nSialidæ (Fig. 560, _l_), in which the body tends to be slightly\r\ncylindrical, though the legs are long, and the gnathites well developed\r\nfor seizing and biting their living prey. The terrestrial larvæ of the\r\nHemerobiidæ, though modifications of the sialid larval form, are\r\nconsiderably specialized in adaptation to their active carnivorous\r\nhabits. But the life-history of Mantispa, where there are two larval\r\nstages, gives us plainly enough the key to the mode in which the\r\ncomplete metamorphosis was brought about. The larva, born a true\r\nCampodea-like form, with large, long, 4–jointed legs, has a structure\r\nwhich would enable it to move about freely after its prey, beginning at\r\nonce to live a sedentary life in the egg-sac of a spider; before the\r\nfirst moult it loses the use of its legs, while the antennæ are partly\r\naborted. The result is that, owing to this change of habits and\r\nsurroundings from those of its active ancestors, it changes its form,\r\nand the fully grown larva becomes cylindrical, with small slender legs,\r\nand, owing to the partial disuse of its jaws, acquires a small, round\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLES OF COLEOPTEROUS LARVÆ, SHOWING THE PASSAGE FROM THE\r\n    CAMPODEOID TO THE ERUCIFORM TYPE OF LARVÆ.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 561.—Coleopterous larvæ showing passage from campodeoid to\r\n    eruciform larvæ: _a_, _b_,\r\n  Harpalus; _c_, Dyticus; _d_, Staphylinus; _e_, Silpha; _f_,\r\n    Melanactes; _g_, Ludius; _h_, Elater; _i_, Donacia;\r\n  _j_, Chrysobothris; _k_, Orthosoma; _l_, Coccinella; _m_, Byrrhus;\r\n    _n_, Trox; _o_, _p_, Lachnosterna; _q_,\r\n  Labidomera; _r_, Ptinus; _s_, Anobium; _t_, Balaninus (entirely\r\n    apodous).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIts antennæ, mouth-parts, and legs not only retarded in growth, but\r\nretrograding and becoming vestigial, the body meanwhile becoming fat and\r\ncylindrical, an apparent acceleration of growth goes on within, with\r\nprobably an enlargement of the intestine and fat-body, and thus the\r\npupal form is perfected while the larva is full-fed and quiescent. It is\r\nnot improbable that in the primitive neuropteron, as the result of a\r\nmode of life like that of Mantispa, the quiescent life of the later\r\nstages graduated into a quiescent, inactive pupal life, allowing the\r\nchanges going on in the internal organs to result in a complete\r\nmetamorphosis, which was transmitted to the later Neuroptera, thus\r\nmaking the complete metamorphosis a fixed, normal condition. It thus\r\nappears that a change of habits and of food, and more especially the\r\nfact that the nymph became so surrounded with an abundance of food close\r\nat hand that it did not have to run actively about and seize it in a\r\nhaphazard manner, were the factors bringing about a change from the\r\nCampodea-form nymph to the eruciform larva, thus inducing a\r\nhypermetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the Mecoptera (Panorpidæ, Fig. 562, _b_) are still more\r\ncaterpillar-like, and besides their cylindrical body, rounded head,\r\nsmall short gnathites, small thoracic legs, they have what appear to be\r\n2–jointed legs to each of the nine abdominal segments, and the close\r\nresemblance to caterpillars is farther carried out by the presence of a\r\npair of prothoracic spiracles, none existing on the other two thoracic\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 562.—Examples of eruciform larvæ: _a_, Phryganea; _b_, Panorpa;\r\n    _c_, Sesia; _d_, _d_, caterpillars; _e_, Selandria; _f_, Tipula;\r\n    _g_, Simulium; _h_, Chionea; _i_, Musca; _j_, Tachina; _k_, Braula;\r\n    _l_, flea; _m_, Tremex; _n_, coarctate larva of Meloë; _o_, bee\r\n    (Andrena).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Meloidæ (Fig. 560, _d_) and Stylopidæ the first larval stage is\r\nCampodea-form; the changes will be described in the subsequent section\r\non Hypermetamorphosis, and while these cases of change from a campodeoid\r\nto an inactive eruciform larva are very salient, if we compare the\r\ngraduated series of larval forms throughout the order of Coleoptera, as\r\nrepresented by the illustrations in Fig. 561, we shall see that in\r\nnearly, if not each, case the form of the boring or mining, or bark or\r\nbud or seed-inhabiting grub is the result of a change of habit and\r\ncommissariat from active predaceous larvæ, like those of the Carabidæ\r\nand other adephagous families, together with those of the Staphylinidæ,\r\nwith their flat body, big mandibles, and well-developed maxillæ, to the\r\ncylindrical bodies of such larvæ as those of Dermestes and Anthrenus,\r\nwhich live a more sedentary life, to the root-feeding wire-worm or\r\nelaterid larvæ, and scarabæid grubs, onward to the phytophagous\r\nChrysomelidæ, with the mining and boring buprestids and cerambycids,—in\r\nall these forms we see a gradual atrophy of the legs, which is fully\r\ncarried out in the vermiform or maggot-like larva of the weevils. These\r\nchanges throughout the members of the entire order are epitomized in the\r\nlife-history of the Meloidæ, in which there are three typical forms of\r\nlarva: the Campodea-form (triungulin stage), eruciform (second or\r\ncarabidoid stage), and vermiform (coarctate) larva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 563.—_Prodoxus cinereus_: _a_, apodous larva; _b_, head and\r\n    prothoracic segment; _c_, anal hooks; _d_, pupa; _e_, cast pupal\r\n    shell protruding from stalk of Yucca; _f_, female; _g_, side view of\r\n    ♂ clasper.—After Riley, from Insect Life.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 564.—Larva of _Limacodes scapha_, nat. size.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Lepidoptera the eruciform, pedate type is adhered to throughout\r\nthe order, with the rare exception of the nearly apodous mining larva of\r\nProdoxus (Fig. 563, _a_), Phyllocnistis, and Nepticula, which have no\r\nthoracic legs, and the limacodid larvæ, whose abdominal legs are totally\r\naborted, while the thoracic ones are much reduced (Fig. 564).\r\n\r\nIn the Hymenoptera the phytophagous forms are eruciform, while by the\r\nagency of the same factors as already mentioned, _i.e._ a sedentary or\r\nparasitic life and abundance of food within constant reach, the larvæ\r\nlose their legs and become vermiform.\r\n\r\nIn the Diptera, which are the most highly specialized of insects, the\r\nmaggot or vermiform shape, and absence of any legs, prevails throughout\r\nthe order, though the eucephalous larvæ show their origin from a\r\nprimitive eruciform type of larva. The highly specialized larvæ of the\r\nCulicidæ and Simuliidae are undoubtedly related to the earliest and most\r\ngeneralized types, while the maggots of the parasitic flies (Tachinidæ)\r\nand other muscids are later degradational forms, and the result of\r\nadaptation induced, as in the previous cases, by a sedentary or\r\nparasitic mode of life, living as they do immersed in an abundance of\r\nrich nitrogenous food, with the result that the mouth-parts have become\r\natrophied by disuse, while the limbs have become entirely aborted,\r\nthough the thoracic imaginal discs develop normally in the embryonic or\r\npre-larval stages.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, highly probable that the metamorphoses of insects\r\nare the result of the action of change of conditions, just as the\r\npolymorphism of Termites is with little doubt the result of differences\r\nof food and other conditions. These matters will be farther discussed\r\nunder the head of Causes of Metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                LITERATURE ON ANCESTRY OF INSECTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Müller, Fritz.= Für Darwin, 1869, pp. 144, 67 Figs.\r\n\r\n  =Brauer, Friedrich.= Betrachtung ueber die Verwandlung der Insekten im\r\n    Sinne der Descendenz-Theorie.

When\r\nthis silkworm hatches, it weighs 1⁄20 of a grain.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n\r\n  10 days old it weighs ½ a grain, or   10 times the original weight.\r\n  20 days old it weighs      3 grains   60 times the original weight.\r\n  30 days old it weighs     31 grains  620 times the original weight.\r\n  40 days old it weighs     90 grains 1800 times the original weight.\r\n  56 days old it weighs    207 grains 4140 times the original weight.\r\n\r\n“When,” he says “a worm is 30 days old, it will have consumed about 90\r\ngrains of food; but when 56 days old, it is fully grown and has consumed\r\nnot less than 120 oak leaves, weighing ¾ of a pound; besides this it has\r\ndrank not less than ½ an ounce of water. So the food taken by a single\r\nsilkworm in 56 days equals in weight 86,000 times the primitive weight\r\nof the worm. Of this about ¼ of a pound becomes excrementitious matter,\r\n207 grains are assimilated, and over 5 ounces have evaporated.”[94]\r\n\r\n  Dandolo stated that the Asiatic silkworm (_Bombyx mori_) weighs on\r\n  hatching not over 1⁄100 of a grain, but when fully grown about 95\r\n  grains. During this period, therefore, it has increased 9500 times\r\n  its original weight, and has eaten 60,000 times its weight of food.\r\n  Newport thought this estimate of the amount of food was a little too\r\n  great. But comparing it with Trouvelot’s estimate for the American\r\n  silkworm, which weighs when hatched five times as much, it would not\r\n  appear to be so. Newport found that the larva of _Sphinx ligustri_\r\n  at the moment of leaving the egg weighs about 1⁄80 of a grain, and\r\n  when fully fed 125 grains, so that in the course of 32 days it\r\n  increases about 9976 times its original weight. This proportion of\r\n  increase is exceeded by the larva of _Cossus ligniperda_, which,\r\n  boring in the trunks of trees, remains about three years in the\r\n  larva state, and increases, according to Lyonet, to the amount of\r\n  72,000 times its first weight.\r\n\r\n  Newport adds that those larvæ in which the proportion of increase is\r\n  the greatest, are usually those which remain longest in the pupa\r\n  state, as in the silkworm. “Thus Redi observed in the maggots of the\r\n  common flesh-flies a rate of increase amounting to about 200 times\r\n  the original weight in 24 hours, but the proportion of increase in\r\n  these larvæ does not at all approach that of the Sphinx and Cossus.”\r\n  From his observations on the larva of one of the wild bees\r\n  (_Anthophora retusa_) Newport believes that this is also the case\r\n  with the Hymenoptera. The weight of the egg of this insect is about\r\n  1⁄150 of a grain, and the average of a full-grown larva 68⁄10\r\n  grains, so that its increase is about 1020 times its original\r\n  weight; “which compared with that of the Sphinx of medium size, is\r\n  but as 1 to 9¾, and to a Sphinx of maximum size only as 1 to a\r\n  little more than 11.”\r\n\r\n  The growth is most rapid after the last moult. “Thus a larva of\r\n  _Sphinx ligustri_, which at its last change weighed only about 19 to\r\n  20 grains, at the expiration of eight days, when it was fully grown,\r\n  weighed nearly 120 grains.” (Newport.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _d._ The process of moulting (ecdysis)\r\n\r\nInsects periodically shed the exoskeleton, together with the chitinous\r\nlining of their internal organs of ectodermal origin, which thus\r\nsloughed off are called the _exuvia_. The process in the locust has been\r\ndescribed by Riley.[95] It occupies from half to three-quarters of an\r\nhour (Fig. 565). This process has naturally, from the ease with which it\r\ncan be observed, been most frequently examined in the Lepidoptera,\r\nthough careful and detailed observations of the inner and outer changes\r\nare still greatly needed, especially in other orders. In the caterpillar\r\nof most moths, especially one of the more generalized bombycine moths,\r\non slipping out of its egg-shell the head is of enormous size as\r\ncompared with the body, but the latter soon fills out after the creature\r\nhas eaten a few hours; the head, of course, does not during this time\r\nincrease in size, and the larvæ of different instars may be exactly\r\ndistinguished, as Dyar has shown, by the measurements of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 565.—Process of moulting from nymph to imago in the locust (_M.\r\n    spretus_): _a_, nymph with skin just split on the back; _b_, the\r\n    imago drawing itself out, at _c_, nearly free; _d_, the imago, with\r\n    wings expanded; _e_, the same with all parts perfect.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore the caterpillar moults, it stops feeding, and the head is now\r\nsmall compared with the body; the head of the second instar is now\r\nlarge, situated partly under the much-swollen prothoracic segment, and\r\npushes the head of the first instar forward.\r\n\r\nNewport has well described the mode of shedding the skin in _Sphinx\r\nligustri_, and his detailed description will apply to most lepidopterous\r\nlarvæ.\r\n\r\n  The whole body is wrinkled and contracted in length, and there are\r\n  occasionally powerful contractions and twitchings of its entire\r\n  body; the skin becomes dry and shrivelled, and is gradually\r\n  separated from the new and very delicate one of the next instar\r\n  beneath. After several powerful efforts of the larva the old skin\r\n  cracks along the middle of the dorsal surface of the mesothoracic\r\n  segment, and by repeated efforts the fissure is extended into the\r\n  1st and 3d segment, while the covering of the head divides along the\r\n  vertex and on each side of the clypeus. “The larva then gradually\r\n  presses itself through the opening, withdrawing first its head and\r\n  thoracic legs, and subsequently the remainder of its body, slipping\r\n  off the skin from behind like the finger of a glove. This process,\r\n  after the skin has once been ruptured, seldom lasts more than a few\r\n  minutes. When first changed the larva is exceedingly delicate, and\r\n  its head, which does not increase in size until it again changes its\r\n  skin, is very large in proportion to the rest of the body.” (Art.\r\n  Insecta, etc.)\r\n\r\n  Trouvelot’s account is more detailed and an advance on that of\r\n  Newport’s view. He explicitly states, and we know that he was a very\r\n  close observer, that the old skin is detached by “a fluid which\r\n  circulates between it and the worm.” His account is as follows: The\r\n  polyphemus worm, like all other silkworms, changes its skin five\r\n  times during its larval life. The moulting takes place at regular\r\n  periods, which comes around about every 10 days for the first four\r\n  moultings, while about 20 days elapse between the fourth and fifth\r\n  moulting. The worm ceases to eat for a day before moulting, and\r\n  spins some silk on the vein of the under surface of a leaf; it then\r\n  secures the hooks of its hind legs in the texture it has thus spun,\r\n  and there remains motionless; soon after, through the transparency\r\n  of the skin of the neck, can be seen a second head larger than the\r\n  first, belonging to the larva within. The moulting generally takes\r\n  place after four o’clock in the afternoon; a little before this time\r\n  the worm holds its body erect, grasping the leaf with the two pairs\r\n  of hind legs only; the skin is wrinkled and detached from the body\r\n  by a fluid which circulates between it and the worm; two\r\n  longitudinal bands are seen on each side, produced by a portion of\r\n  the lining of the spiracles, which at this moment have been partly\r\n  detached; meanwhile the contractions of the worm are very energetic,\r\n  and by them the skin is pulled off and pushed towards the posterior\r\n  part; the skin thus becomes so extended that it soon tears just\r\n  under the neck, and then from the head. When this is accomplished\r\n  the most difficult operation is over, and now the process of\r\n  moulting goes on very rapidly. By repeated contractions the skin is\r\n  folded towards the tail, like a glove when taken off, and the lining\r\n  of the spiracles comes out in long white filaments. When about\r\n  one-half of the body appears, the shell still remains like a cap,\r\n  enclosing the jaws; then the worm, as if reminded of this loose\r\n  skull-cap, removes it by rubbing it on a leaf; this done, the worm\r\n  finally crawls out of its skin, which is attached to the fastening\r\n  made for the purpose. Once out of its old skin, the worm makes a\r\n  careful review of the operation, with its head feeling the aperture\r\n  of every spiracle, as well as the tail, probably for the purpose of\r\n  removing any broken fragment of skin which might have remained in\r\n  these delicate organs. Not only is the outer skin cast off, but also\r\n  the lining of the air-tubes and intestines, together with all the\r\n  chewing organs and other appendages of the head. After the moulting,\r\n  the size of the larva is considerably increased, the head is large\r\n  compared with the body, but 8 or 10 days later it will look small,\r\n  as the body will have increased very much in size. This is a certain\r\n  indication that the worm is about to moult. Every 10 days the same\r\n  operation is repeated. From the fourth moulting to the time of\r\n  beginning the cocoon the period is about 16 days. (Amer. Naturalist,\r\n  i, pp. 37, 38.)\r\n\r\n  Little has been recorded as to the exact mode of casting the larval\r\n  skin in Coleoptera. Slingerland states that _Euphoria inda_ when\r\n  pupating sheds the larval skin off the anal end in the same way as\r\n  in caterpillars, while in _Pelidnota punctata_ the larval skin\r\n  splits down the whole length of the back, retains the larval shape,\r\n  and forms a covering for the pupa which remains inside. (Can.\r\n  Entomologist, xxix, p. 52.) The old larval skin in the Coccinellidæ\r\n  and certain Chrysomelidæ is retained crumpled up at the end of the\r\n  body, while in Dermestes, Anthrenus, etc., it cloaks the pupa.\r\n\r\n  Not only is the integument, with its hairs, setæ, and other\r\n  armatures, as well as the cornea or facets of the eyes, shed, but\r\n  also all the lining or intima of those internal organs which have\r\n  been originally derived by an ingrowth or invagination of the\r\n  ectoderm are likewise cast off, with the probable exception, of\r\n  course, of the mid-intestine, which is endodermal in its origin.\r\n  Even so early an observer as Swammerdam noticed that the internal\r\n  lining of the alimentary canal comes away with the skin. He states\r\n  that the larva of _Oryctes nasicornis_ sheds both the lining of the\r\n  colon, and of the smaller as well as the larger branches of the\r\n  tracheæ.\r\n\r\n  Careful observations are still needed on the internal changes at\r\n  ecdysis of most insects. Newport seems to have observed more closely\r\n  than any one else, notwithstanding the great number who have reared\r\n  caterpillars but have not carefully observed these points, the\r\n  extent of the process internally. He informs us: “The lining of the\r\n  mouth and pharynx, with that of the mandibles, is detached with the\r\n  covering of the head, and that of the large intestines with the skin\r\n  of the posterior part of the body, and besides these also the lining\r\n  of the tracheal tubes. The lining of the stomach itself, or the\r\n  portion of the alimentary canal which extends from the termination\r\n  of the œsophagus to the insertion of the so-called biliary vessels,\r\n  is also detached, and becomes completely disintegrated, and appears\r\n  to constitute part of the _meconium_ voided by the insect on\r\n  assuming its imago state.” (Art. Insecta, p. 876.) Newport states on\r\n  another occasion that he had “noticed the remarkable circumstance\r\n  [now explained by the fact that the mid-intestine is of endodermal\r\n  origin] that the mucous lining of the true ventriculus was not cast\r\n  off with the rest, but was discharged with the fecula.”[96]\r\n  Burmeister also observed that the smaller tracheæ as well as the\r\n  internal tunic of the colon of Libellulæ are shed.\r\n\r\n  In the apodous larvæ of Hymenoptera which live in cells, as we have\r\n  observed in those of Bombus, during the process of moulting, the\r\n  delicate skin breaks away in shreds, probably owing to the tension\r\n  due to the unequal growth of the different parts of the body. “Thus\r\n  after the skin beneath has fully formed, shreds of the former skin\r\n  remain about the mouth-parts, the spiracles, and anus. Upon pulling\r\n  upon these, the lining of the alimentary tube and tracheæ can be\r\n  drawn out, sometimes, in the former case, to the length of several\r\n  lines.”[97] We then added, “As all these internal systems of vessels\r\n  are destined to change their form in the pupa, it may be laid down\r\n  as a rule in the moulting of insects and Crustacea, that the lining\r\n  of the internal organs, which is simply a continuation of the outer\r\n  tegument, or arthroderm, is, in the process of moulting, sloughed\r\n  off with that outer integument.” We have satisfied ourself that in\r\n  the larvæ of the Lepidoptera (_e.g._ Datana) the tracheæ at the time\r\n  of ecdysis undergo a complete histolysis, and arise _de novo_ from\r\n  hypodermal cells, the so-called spiral threads originating from\r\n  elongated peritracheal nuclei. (See p. 449, Fig. 412.) This is\r\n  undoubtedly also the case with the salivary ducts, which are\r\n  strengthened and rendered elastic by tænidia like those of tracheæ.\r\n  As the urinary tubes are diverticula of the proctodæum, itself an\r\n  ectodermal invagination, they may also, though not lined with a\r\n  chitinous intima, be renewed. With little doubt the intima of the\r\n  ducts of poison, spinning, and most, if not all the other glands,\r\n  though certainly the dermal glands, is exuviated. We have found that\r\n  the lobster in moulting sheds, besides the skin with the most\r\n  delicate setæ, the lining of the proventriculus, and the apodemes of\r\n  the head and thorax, hence it is most probable that the tentorium of\r\n  the head of insects as well as the apodemes and phragmas of the\r\n  thorax are exuviated.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the inner skin, or that of any succeeding stage\r\n(instar), is due to the secretion of the structureless chitinous layer\r\nby the cells of the hypodermis, during the process of histogenesis.\r\nThese cells at this time are very active, and the formation of the new\r\nlayer of chitin arrests the supply of nourishment to the old skin, so\r\nthat it dries, hardens, and with the aid of the fluid thrown out at this\r\ntime separates from the new chitinous layer secreted by the hypodermis.\r\n\r\n  Mention of this fluid, which Newport was the first to observe, and\r\n  which he says causes the separation of the old from the underlying\r\n  fresh integument of the caterpillar, recalls a passage in\r\n  Hatchett-Jackson’s Studies in the morphology of the Lepidoptera,\r\n  which we quote on a succeeding page, where he calls attention to the\r\n  formation of such a liquid, which in the reptiles facilitates the\r\n  process of moulting, adding, “Whether such is the case with the\r\n  moult of the caterpillar, I do not know.” Is it not also possible\r\n  that the growth of the setæ or tubercles on the cuticle of the\r\n  caterpillar may likewise serve to loosen and detach the overlying\r\n  skin about to be cast off? After writing the foregoing, we find that\r\n  Miall and Denny have suggested that the setæ of the cockroach\r\n  probably serve the same purpose as the casting-hairs of the crayfish\r\n  and reptiles.\r\n\r\n  It is well known that in the crayfish and in lizards the skin is\r\n  first loosened by the growth of temporary hairs or setæ, which\r\n  locally grow inward from the old cuticle and push the skin away when\r\n  it is shuffled off by the movements of the body, jaws, and limbs, as\r\n  well as the body in general.[98]\r\n\r\nSuch spines arise in the pupa of many insects, for Verhoeff finds that\r\nthe spines and teeth of pupal fossorial and other Hymenoptera, as well\r\nas Coleoptera, function as moulting-processes for loosening and pushing\r\noff the last larval skin, rather than for locomotion. He also claims\r\nthat the spines of the pupa of the dipterous Anthrax are both for\r\nlocomotion and for boring, especially the spines on the head and tail.\r\nHe therefore divides these pupal spines into helcodermatous (boring or\r\ntearing) and locomotor spines.\r\n\r\nGonin has fully confirmed Newport’s discovery of the exuvial fluid. He\r\nstates that during pupation the outside of the pupa, especially the\r\nparts of the head and thorax “is coated with a viscous liquid secreted\r\nby special glands.” The parts only harden subsequent to pupation after\r\nexposure to the air (p. 41). His observations were made under the\r\ndirection of Professor Bugnion, who kindly writes us:—\r\n\r\n  “M. Gonin has proved the formation of a liquid which passes under\r\n  the cuticle at the time of the last moult and facilitates\r\n  exuviation. We think that this liquid is secreted by large cells\r\n  (unicellular glands) which we see especially on the surface of\r\n  segments 1–3. These cells form part of the hypodermis, and their\r\n  pores open under the cuticle.”\r\n\r\n  In a subsequent letter enclosing a sketch kindly made for me by M.\r\n  Gonin (Fig. 566), Professor Bugnion writes me Aug. 24, 1897,\r\n  regarding the functions of the large hypodermal cells (_l. hy_), as\r\n  follows: “It seems to me, in fact, after having again examined the\r\n  sections, that the function of these cells is not sufficiently\r\n  elucidated. Indeed these cells occur only in the section passing\r\n  through the 1st segment, between the head and 1st thoracic segment.\r\n  It would seem, if these cells supply the liquid which lubricates the\r\n  surface at the time of ecdysis, that they should be spread over the\r\n  entire surface of the body. Moreover, these cells have no distinct\r\n  orifice, and although there is seen at times to issue streams of a\r\n  substance (coagulated by the reagents), they cannot be compared with\r\n  true unicellular glands like those of the epidermis of fishes,\r\n  amphibians, etc.\r\n\r\n  “On the other hand, if it is the blood which oozes out on the\r\n  surface (according to your hypothesis), it would seem that the loss\r\n  of blood would cause the death of the larva. I believe then it is\r\n  due to the secretion of the hypodermis which spreads over the whole\r\n  surface when the cells are still soft (not yet hardened from contact\r\n  with the air). At all events, there is a liquid spread over the\r\n  surface; it is this liquid which glues the wings and the legs to the\r\n  body at the moment the caterpillar issues from the rent in its skin.\r\n  If at this instant we plunge the pupa in the water the liquid is\r\n  dissolved, and the feet, wings, etc., are not glued to the body.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. T. A. Chapman also writes us: “There is no question about the\r\n  existence of a fluid between the two skins at moulting. In hairy\r\n  larvae the hairs are always wet at first, or if the skin be renewed\r\n  rather more quickly than the larva does it naturally, the wetness of\r\n  both surfaces is obvious. I do not know the nature of the fluid, but\r\n  it is related to that which hardens into the dense pupal case, and\r\n  also hardens in a less degree the skin of the larva. I suppose it\r\n  must contain some chitin in a soluble form. If a newly cast larva\r\n  skin be taken, there is no difficulty in extending the shrivelled\r\n  mass to its full length and dimensions, but if a short time elapses,\r\n  this chitin hardens, and the skin cannot be extended after soaking\r\n  in water, alcohol, ammonia, or any other solvent I have tried.”\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that there is a subimaginal pellicle in Lepidoptera,\r\nbut as Dr. Chapman writes me, “what has been observed has been some of\r\nthe inner pupal dissepiments, such as the pupal cases of the under\r\nwings,” etc. They may be observed in the head of the tineid pupæ, and\r\nother small moths. We have thought that the delicate, purplish, powdery\r\nlayer left in the cast shells of the pupæ of saturnians, Catocalæ, and\r\nother moths, might possibly be such a pellicle, but this view has been\r\ndispelled by the following statement of Professor Bugnion in a letter\r\nanswering an inquiry whether he had noticed such a pellicle.\r\n\r\n  “A liquid which is secreted in a few minutes at the time of the last\r\n  moult, forms in drying a yellowish layer spotted with black (in\r\n  _Pieris brassicæ_). This layer extends around the entire pupa, and\r\n  serves both to protect it and to glue together the wings, legs,\r\n  etc., in their new position. The dried liquid on the surface of the\r\n  pupa, and by means of which the appendages are glued to the surface,\r\n  very likely corresponds to the pellicle of which you speak.” The\r\n  newly exposed integument is at first pale and colorless, but soon\r\n  assumes the hues peculiar to the species, and the insect, at first\r\n  exhausted, after a short rest becomes active.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 566.—Transverse section through the prothoracic segment\r\n    (ventral face) of larva of _Pieris brassicæ_, about 12 hours\r\n    before pupation: _c_, cuticula; _l. hy_, large glandular (?)\r\n    hypodermal cells; gradually passing into normal hypodermal cells\r\n    (_hy_).—Gonin _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\n  E. Howgate has noticed under the microscope peculiar internal\r\n  movements in a small immature transparent geometrid while moulting.\r\n  “Each separate segment,” he says, “commencing at the head, elongated\r\n  within the outer skin, whilst the next ones remained in their former\r\n  state. Each segment in its turn behaved in this curious manner until\r\n  the last was reached, when the motion was reversed and proceeded\r\n  toward the head, when it was again reversed.... The whole proceeding\r\n  appeared as if the larva was gliding within itself, segment after\r\n  segment, the outer skin remaining as if held by the other segments,\r\n  whilst the particular one in motion freed itself within. After\r\n  remaining motionless for a short interval, the skin near the head\r\n  swelled and burst, open at the back.... Presently out comes the head\r\n  of the new caterpillar, pushing forward the old one.... After a\r\n  short struggle the new true legs appear, pushing off and treading\r\n  under foot the old ones. Then by violent wriggling movements the\r\n  abdominal legs were extricated. Then all is clear, and the larva,\r\n  which is quite exhausted, coils itself up and literally pants for\r\n  breath.” (The Naturalist, November, 1885, No. 124, p. 366, quoted in\r\n  Psyche, iv, p. 327, 1887.)\r\n\r\n  Since the worms and most other ametabolous invertebrates are not\r\n  known to moult their integument, the body steadily increasing in\r\n  size without frequent changes of skin, it seems that growth may go\r\n  on and still be accompanied by considerable changes in shape of the\r\n  body without change of skin. Frequent ecdyses appear, then, to be\r\n  the result of the great and sudden changes of the body, necessitated\r\n  by the adaptation of the animal to new or unusual conditions of\r\n  life. In young Daphnia, a cladocerous crustacean, as many as eight\r\n  moults were observed in a period of 17 days, and spiders frequently\r\n  moult even after reaching their full size. The swollen bodies of the\r\n  gravid female of Gastrophysa, Meloë, or of Termites, and of the\r\n  honey ant show that the skin can stretch to a great extent, but in\r\n  the metamorphoses of Crustacea and of insects, whose young are more\r\n  or less worm-like or generalized in form, with fewer segments and\r\n  appendages, or with appendages adapted for quite different uses from\r\n  those of mature life, the necessity for a change of skin is seen to\r\n  be necessary for mechanical reasons. Hence Crustacea and insects\r\n  moult most frequently early in life, when the changes of form are\r\n  most thoroughgoing and radical, while simple growth and increase in\r\n  size are most rapid at the end of larval life, as seen both in\r\n  shrimps and crabs, and in insects.\r\n\r\n  The hibernating caterpillars of certain butterflies are known to\r\n  moult once oftener than those of the summer brood. Mr. W. H. Edwards\r\n  has discussed the subject with much detail. “There seems,” he says,\r\n  “to be a necessity with the hibernators of getting rid of the rigid\r\n  skin in which the larva has passed the winter; that is, if the\r\n  hibernation has taken place during the middle stages, as it does in\r\n  Apatura and Limenitis. In these cases very little food is taken\r\n  between the moult which precedes hibernation and the one which\r\n  follows it, and the larva while in lethargy is actually smaller than\r\n  before the next previous moult. The skin shrinks, and has to be cast\r\n  off before the awakened larva can grow. Those species (observed)\r\n  whose larva moults five times in the winter brood require but four\r\n  moults during the summer.” He adds that while the larva is in\r\n  lethargy, it is actually smaller than before the next previous\r\n  moult. Dr. Dyar writes: “I think there is no doubt about the number\r\n  of stages of arctian larvæ. They seem to have a great capacity of\r\n  spinning out their life-history by interpolated stages (as regards\r\n  width of head). I think it is because so many of them hibernate, and\r\n  only a single brood extends throughout the season.” (Psyche iii, p.\r\n  161.)\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why the\r\n  caterpillars of arctians moult so frequently, nearly twice as often\r\n  as in most other caterpillars, though the changes of form and\r\n  armature are so slight.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Chapman also writes me: “Arctians resemble bears (Arctos), polar\r\n  and others, in having long hairs to protect them during winter, and\r\n  are, in fact, typically hibernators. Many of them have to\r\n  half-hibernate, having warmth enough to keep them awake, but not\r\n  enough food for growth, but their tissues, at least the chitinous\r\n  ones of the cutis, and also probably, and perhaps especially, of the\r\n  alimentary canal, become old and effete, and require the\r\n  rejuvenescence acquired by a moult. Other smooth-skinned hibernators\r\n  have similar capabilities.”\r\n\r\n  Chapman has shown in his paper on Acronycta that these caterpillars\r\n  of this genus illustrate how larvæ may lose a moult, and they do so\r\n  to acquire a sudden change of plumage.\r\n\r\n=The number of moults in insects of different orders.=—It will be seen\r\nfrom the data here presented that the number of moults is as a rule\r\ngreatest in holometabolic insects with the longest lives, and that an\r\nexcessive number of ecdyses may at times be due to some physical cause,\r\nsuch as lack of food combined with low temperature.\r\n\r\nIn Campodea there is a single fragmentary moult (Grassi), while the\r\nCollembola (_Macrotoma plumbea_) shed their skin throughout life.\r\n(Sommer.)\r\n\r\nIn the winged insects, especially Lepidoptera, the number of moults is\r\ndependent on climate. Insects of wide distribution growing faster in\r\nwarmer climates consequently shed their skins oftener; for example, the\r\nsame species may moult once oftener in the southern than in the northern\r\nStates, as in the case of _Callosamia promethea_, which in West Virginia\r\nis double-brooded. Hibernating larvæ moult once oftener than those of\r\nthe summer brood. (W. H. Edwards.) Weniger by rearing the larvæ of\r\n_Antheræa mylitta_ and _Eacles imperialis_, and which, when reared under\r\nnormal conditions, actually have six stages, found that when reared in a\r\nwarm moist atmosphere of about 25° C. they have but five stages, _i.e._\r\nmoult but four times. In the hot and moist climate of Ceylon, _A.\r\nmylitta_ has but five stages. (Psyche, v, p. 28.)\r\n\r\nAmong Orthoptera Acrydians moult five times; _Diapheromera femorata_ but\r\ntwice (Riley); a katydid (_Microcentrum retinervis_) moults four times\r\n(Comstock). _Mantis religiosa_, according to Pagenstecher, moults seven\r\ntimes, having eight stages, including that before the amnion is cast,\r\nbut the first “moult” being an exuviation of the amnion, the number of\r\nstages is seven. Cockroaches (_Periplaneta americana_) are said by\r\nMarlatt to “pass through a variable number of moults, there being\r\nsometimes as many as seven.”\r\n\r\nIn the Homoptera there are, in general, from two to four moults; thus in\r\nTyphlocyba there are five stages, and in Aphis at least three, and in\r\nPsylla four during the nymphal state. Psocus has four. Riley states that\r\nthe nymph of the female coccid, _Icerya purchasi_, sheds its skin three\r\ntimes, and that of the male twice. Notwithstanding its slow growth,\r\nRiley says, the 17–year Cicada moults oftener than once a year, and the\r\nnumber of larval stages probably amounts to 25 or 30 in all. The bed-bug\r\nsheds its skin five times; and with the last moult appear the minute\r\nwing-pads characteristic of the adult. In _Conorhinus sanguisuga_ there\r\nare “at least two larval stages and pupal stages.” (Marlatt.)\r\n\r\nIn the dragon-flies moulting occurs, Calvert thinks, many times, since\r\nthe rudiments of wings are said by Poletaiew to only appear in odonate\r\nnymphs after the third or fourth moult.\r\n\r\nIn the May-fly, Chloëon, the number of ecdyses is 20. The neuropterous\r\n_Ascalaphus_ (Helecomitus) _insimulans_ of Ceylon moults three times\r\nbefore pupating. Among the Mecoptera Felt has shown that _Panorpa\r\nrufescens_ moults seven times.\r\n\r\nIn Coleoptera the normal or usual number is not definitely known; Meloë\r\nmoults five times, but this is a hypermetamorphic insect; _Tribolium\r\nconfusum_ has been carried by Mr. Chittenden through seven moults.\r\n_Phytonomus punctatus_, the clover-leaf weevil, moults three times,\r\naccording to Riley, who has observed that _Dermestes vulpinus_ passes\r\nthrough seven larval stages.\r\n\r\n  In the breeding jars, with plenty of food and a constant temperature\r\n  of from 68° to 78° F., the larvæ cast their 1st skin in from four to\r\n  nine days, the great majority moulting at seven days. Under the same\r\n  conditions the 2d skin was cast at from four to seven days, the\r\n  majority moulting at six days; the 3d skin at from three to six\r\n  days, the majority moulting at five days; and the 4th skin at from\r\n  three to six days, the majority moulting at five days; the 5th skin\r\n  at from five to seven days, and the 6th skin at six days. There are\r\n  thus seven larval stages. (Report for 1885, p. 260.)\r\n\r\n  Riley has ascertained that by rearing isolated larvæ of _Tenebrio\r\n  molitor_, one after being kept nearly a year had moulted 11 times,\r\n  when it died. A second larva, hatched June 5, had moulted 12 times\r\n  by June 10 of the following year, (1877), when it also died. Of _T.\r\n  obscurus_ three larvæ were reared to the imago state. One moulted 11\r\n  times by Aug. 30 of the same year, pupated Jan. 20, 1877, and\r\n  finally became a beetle Feb. 7, 1877. The other two both moulted 12\r\n  times, and reached the imago stage Feb. 18 and March 9,\r\n  respectively. “All were, as nearly as possible, under like\r\n  conditions of food and surroundings, and in all cases the moult that\r\n  gave the pupa is not considered among the larval moults.”\r\n\r\n  Two larvæ of the museum pest (_Trogoderma tarsale_) were kept by\r\n  Riley in a tight tin box with an old silkworm cocoon. “They were\r\n  half-grown when placed in the box. On Nov. 8, 1880, there were in\r\n  the box 28 larva skins, all very much of a size, the larva having\r\n  apparently grown but little. The skins were removed and the box\r\n  closed again as tightly as possible. Recently, or after a lapse of\r\n  two years, the box was again opened and we found one of the larvæ\r\n  dead and shrivelled up; but the other was living and apparently not\r\n  changed in appearance. There were 15 larva skins in the box. He\r\n  could not tell when the one larva died, but it is certain that\r\n  within a little more than three and a half years, two larvæ shed not\r\n  less than 43 skins, and that one larva did not, during that time,\r\n  appreciably increase in size. We know of no observations which\r\n  indicate the normal or average length of life, or number of moults\r\n  in either Tenebrio or Trogoderma, but it is safe to assume from what\r\n  is known, in these respects, of allied species, that in both the\r\n  instances here referred to, but particularly in the case of\r\n  Trogoderma, development was retarded by insufficient nutrition, and\r\n  that the frequent moulting and slow growth resulted therefrom, and\r\n  were correlated.”[99] Further observations such as these are greatly\r\n  needed.\r\n\r\nOf the Siphonaptera the common cat and dog flea (_Pulex serraticeps_)\r\nmoults three times before pupating. (Howard.)\r\n\r\nIn Lepidoptera the usual or average number of moults is four, but the\r\nnumber varies considerably, the greatest number yet known occurring in\r\n_Phyrrarctia isabella_, which, Dr. Dyar informs me, moults 10 times.\r\n\r\nFrom Dyar’s observations it appears that there are usually five larval\r\nstages, but six and seven stages are not infrequent, while there are\r\nseven in _Seirarctia echo_, eight in _Ecpantheria scribonia_, Scepis,\r\nand Apatelodes, and nine and ten in arctians, while the European _Nola\r\ncentonalis_ moults nine times, other species of this genus shedding\r\ntheir skins six times. (Buckler.) (Psyche, v, pp. 420–422.) _Callosamia\r\npromethea_ appears, as a rule, to moult but three times. _Orgyia\r\nantiqua_ was found by Hellins to moult from three to five times. Riley\r\nfound that in _O. leucostigma_ the males moult four times, the female\r\nfour, but sometimes five times, while Dyar states that in _O. gulosa_\r\nthe male larvæ moult three or four times, the female always four times;\r\nin _O. antiqua_, however, there are six stages, and in the female seven.\r\nLithocolletis, Chambers thinks, as a rule, moults eight times, and\r\nComstock thinks that _L. hamadryadella_ casts its skin seven or eight\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn the blow-fly (Calliphora) Leuckart and Weismann have inferred at\r\nleast two moults, while Weismann suspected that there are as many as\r\nfour. In _Musca domestica_ we have observed that the larva moults three\r\ntimes; in Œstridæ there are three larval stadia. (Brauer.) In Corethra\r\nthere are four larval moults, and Miall thinks there are probably as\r\nmany in Chironomus. Passing to the phytophagous Hymenoptera, there are\r\nthree moults or four larval stages in _Nematus erichsonii_, but Dyar\r\ninforms us that less than four stages in saw-fly larvæ is very rare,\r\nthat he has only one record of less than five, and that that is\r\ndoubtful; “five for nematid, six and seven for others, is certainly the\r\nrule. The highest I have is the indication of 11 stages for _Harpiphorus\r\nvarianus_, but this again is an inference only, and attended with\r\ndoubt.” (Can. Ent., xxvii, p. 208.) In Bombus we have observed five\r\ndifferent sizes of larvæ, and hence suppose the least number of ecdyses\r\nis five, while we are disposed to believe that this insect, as well as\r\nwasps and bees, in general shed their skins as many as eight times\r\nduring their entire existence.\r\n\r\nThe honey-bee, Cheshire thinks, since he has found the old and ruptured\r\npellicles, probably moults six times before it spins its cocoon, or\r\npasses into the semipupa condition. (Bees and Bee-keeping, p. 20.)\r\n\r\nAs to the cause of the great number of moults in the arctians and in the\r\nbeetles experimented with by Riley, it would seem that cold and the lack\r\nof food during hibernation were the agents in arctians, and starvation\r\nor the lack of food in the case of the beetles, such cause preventing\r\ngrowth, though the hypodermis-cells retained their activity.\r\n\r\n=Reproduction of lost limbs.=—Here might be discussed the subject of the\r\nrenovation or renewal of maimed or lost limbs, or the reparation of\r\nother injuries. As is well known, the cœlenterates, echinoderms, and\r\nworms under certain circumstances multiply by self-division, or if\r\nartificially mutilated, the parts are gradually restored by\r\ncell-proliferation or histogenesis. It is so with the antennæ and legs\r\nof crustaceans as well as the digits and tail of salamanders. The\r\nexperiments first made by Le Pelletier[100] on spiders, and later by\r\nHeineken,[101] and others after him, on different spiders, as well as on\r\nOrthoptera and Hemiptera (Blatta, Reduvius, etc.), have proved that\r\nantennæ and legs and other external parts which have been injured or\r\nshortened, or entirely cut off in young individuals, are replaced at the\r\nnext, or after successive moults, though generally in diminished size.\r\nThis does not usually occur in adult life, and the process of reparation\r\nof lost parts is apparently due to the active growth of the cells of the\r\nparts affected during the process of moulting, when the histolysis of\r\nthe maimed or diseased parts is succeeded by the rapid development of\r\nnew cells, not only of the hypodermis, but also of the more specialized\r\ntissues within. And this tends to prove that such histolysis and making\r\nover of the muscles and other structures within occur especially in all\r\nmetamorphic insects, and also in ametabolous forms, though the process\r\nhas been most thoroughly examined in the Diptera, where these changes\r\nare more marked.\r\n\r\nGonin has found that the thoracic legs of the caterpillar correspond\r\nonly to the tarsi of the imago (Fig. 608). It results, he says, from\r\nthis fact that in accordance with the observations of Réaumur (which\r\nwere wrongly interpreted by Newport and Künckel D’Herculais) that the\r\namputation of the legs of the larva does not involve the entire leg, but\r\nonly the extremity of the leg of the imago.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the cocoon.=—While the larvæ of many insects, as those of\r\nthe butterflies, suspend themselves before transforming, and spin no\r\ncocoon, or dig into the earth for protection and to secure an immunity\r\nfrom too great changes of temperature, a large proportion of the larvæ\r\nof metabolous insects which lead an inactive pupal life, line their\r\nearthen cells with silk, or spin a more or less elaborate case of silk,\r\ncalled the _cocoon_. We have seen that the inactive pupa of the male\r\nscale-insects is covered by the scale itself, or even in one case the\r\ninsect forms a true cocoon of fibres of wax. The aquatic larvæ of the\r\nNeuroptera and Coleoptera creep out of the water, and by the movements\r\nof their bodies make a rude earthen cell in the bank, while that of\r\nDonacia spins a dense, leathery cocoon (Fig. 567) in the earth. The\r\nlarvæ of the Embiidæ are protected by a cocoon, which they renew at each\r\nmoult. Coniopteryx spins an orbicular cocoon, the Hemerobiidæ a\r\nspherical, dense, whitish one. The Trichoptera transform within their\r\nlarval cases, which thus serve as cocoons, as do certain case-bearing\r\nLepidoptera, notably the Psychidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 567.—Cocoon (natural size) of _Donacia proxima_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 568.—Cocoon and larva of _Lucanus dama_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pupa of certain leaf-eating beetles (Chrysomelidæ), as well as the\r\nCoccinellidæ, Dermestidæ, Hister, etc., are usually protected by the\r\ncast larval skin, which is retained, forming a rude shelter. While many\r\nbeetles spin an oval cocoon (Gyrinus, Silphidæ), the wood-boring species\r\nmake one of chips glued together, and that of Lucanus, which feeds on\r\ndecayed wood, is lined with silk (Fig. 568). Anobium constructs a silken\r\ncocoon, interweaving the fine particles of its thin castings; the larvæ\r\nof weevils also usually spin silken cocoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 569.—Larva (_a_), puparium (_b_), and imago (_c_) of Sarcophaga,\r\n    enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 570.—_a_, _Erax bastardi_; _b_, pupa.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe larval skin of the coarctate Diptera is retained as a protection for\r\nthe soft-bodied pupa within, the old larval skin separating from the\r\nintegument of the semipupa. To this cocoon-like covering of the\r\ncoarctate pupa we have restricted the term _puparium_, originally used\r\nby Kirby and Spence to designate the pupa. The puparium is usually\r\ncylindrical or barrel-shaped, rounded at each end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 571.—Puparium of _Hypoderma bovis_: _a_, side; _b_, ventral view,\r\n    showing exit hole of adult; _c_, cap which splits off for exit of\r\n    fly.—After Clark, from Osborn, Bull. 5, Div. Ent. U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the _Diptera cyclorhapha_, or common house and flesh flies, etc., the\r\npuparium remains in vital connection, by means of four tracheæ, with the\r\nenclosed pupa, which escapes from the case through a curved seam or lid\r\nat the anterior end and not by a slit in the back, as do the\r\northoraphous families, represented by the horse-fly (Tabanidæ, Asilidæ,\r\nFig. 570), etc., where in some cases the obtected pupa remains within\r\nthe loose envelope formed by the old larval skin, which Brauer calls a\r\nfalse puparium. The dry, hard puparium is burst open at the cephalic end\r\nwhen the fly emerges, by means of the frontal vesicle, which is\r\ndistended with fluid (Fig. 571).\r\n\r\nThe exact mode of spinning the cocoon by caterpillars has been carefully\r\nobserved by L. Trouvelot in the case of the polyphemus silkworm.\r\n\r\n  “When fully grown, the worm, which has been devouring the leaves so\r\n  voraciously, becomes restless and crawls about the branches in\r\n  search of a suitable place to build up its cocoon; before this it is\r\n  motionless for some time, holding on to the twig with its front\r\n  legs, while the two hind pair are detached; in this position it\r\n  remains for some time, evacuating the contents of the alimentary\r\n  canal until finally a gelatinous, transparent, very caustic fluid,\r\n  looking like albumen, or the white of an egg, is ejected; this is a\r\n  preparation for the long catalepsy that the worm is about to fall\r\n  into. It now feels with its head in all directions, to discover any\r\n  leaves to which to attach the fibres that are to give form to the\r\n  cocoon. If it finds the place suitable, it begins to wind a layer of\r\n  silk around a twig, then a fibre is attached to a leaf near by, and\r\n  by many times doubling this fibre and making it shorter every time,\r\n  the leaf is made to approach the twig at the distance necessary to\r\n  build the cocoon; two or three leaves are disposed like this one,\r\n  and then fibres are spread between them in all directions, and soon\r\n  the ovoid form of the cocoon distinctly appears. This seems to be\r\n  the most difficult feat for the worm to accomplish, as after this\r\n  the work is simply mechanical, the cocoon being made of regular\r\n  layers of silk united by a gummy substance. The silk is distributed\r\n  in zigzag lines of about one-eighth of an inch long. When the cocoon\r\n  is made, the worm will have moved his head to and fro, in order to\r\n  distribute the silk, about 254,000 times.\r\n\r\n  “After about half a day’s work, the cocoon is so far completed that\r\n  the worm can hardly be distinguished through the fine texture of the\r\n  wall; then a gummy resinous substance, sometimes of a light-brown\r\n  color, is spread all over the inside of the cocoon. The larva\r\n  continues to work for four or five days, hardly taking a few minutes\r\n  of rest, and finally another coating is spun in the interior, when\r\n  the cocoon is all finished and completely air tight. The fibre\r\n  diminishes in thickness as the completion of the cocoon advances, so\r\n  that the last internal coating is not half so thick and so strong as\r\n  the outside ones.” (Amer. Naturalist, i, p. 86.)\r\n\r\nThe mode of spinning the cocoon of an ichneumon (Microgaster) parasitic\r\non Philampelus has been well described by John P. Marshall, as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 572.—Microgaster larvæ; spinning their cocoons: _a_, enlarged\r\n    view of 5.—After Marshall.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The first appearance of the parasite is represented in Fig. 572, 1.\r\n  A warty excrescence appears on the back of the caterpillar, which\r\n  slowly emerges until it is seen to be a larva enclosed in a delicate\r\n  transparent membrane, as represented in 2. This it soon succeeds in\r\n  bursting, and, rising to its full length, balances itself a moment\r\n  as in 3, then, bending double, it ejects from its mouth a glairy\r\n  liquid, which instantly changes to silk, and fastens the posterior\r\n  end to the skin of the caterpillar, as shown in 4, side view. It now\r\n  begins to spin its cocoon by attaching a silken thread to the silky\r\n  mass by which it had previously fastened itself to the caterpillar,\r\n  and forming a series of loops of uniform size, first from right to\r\n  left, and then back again from left to right, as represented in the\r\n  front view, 5, and better in the enlarged view, _5^a_, the arrow\r\n  heads showing the direction in which the head of the larva moved\r\n  while forming the loops. The ends of the series, numbered 1, 2, 3,\r\n  4, are fastened to the edges of the ventral side of the body, which\r\n  thus serves as a measure of the width of the cocoon, and also acts\r\n  as a support for the frail fabric in the first stages of spinning.\r\n  After the larva has fastened the fabric as far up on its ventral\r\n  surface as it can, conveniently, it then begins to spin free, as\r\n  shown in the side view, 6, where it is represented as just\r\n  completing the first half of its cocoon, which resembles in form a\r\n  slipper. This accomplished, the larva ceases to spin for the time\r\n  being, bends its head, as in 7, towards its ventral surface, and\r\n  pushes the half cocoon free from its body. The form of the silken\r\n  fabric enables it to stand unsupported, while the larva, sliding its\r\n  head down to the base, holds on firmly until it swings its posterior\r\n  end into the toe of the slipper.\r\n\r\n  Figure 572, 8, shows it in the act of changing end for end, and in 9\r\n  the larva is seen erect, beginning at the base to complete the other\r\n  half of its cocoon; 10 shows the larva contracting its body as it\r\n  spins upward for about half the length of the cocoon, when it again\r\n  changes end for end, as shown in 11, where it is beginning at the\r\n  upper part to unite the two sides, finally enclosing itself as\r\n  represented in 12.\r\n\r\n  It may now be seen, under the microscope, through the meshes of its\r\n  cocoon actively engaged in lining the interior with layers of very\r\n  fine silk ejected from its mouth in great abundance. One half of the\r\n  cocoon is first lined by a forward and back movement of its head,\r\n  and then reversing its position, it lines the other half in a\r\n  similar manner.\r\n\r\n  In one case the larva was disengaged from the skin of the\r\n  caterpillar, after beginning its cocoon. It, however, began again,\r\n  and spun a portion while lying on the table. This was removed, when\r\n  it began a third time, and completed its cocoon.\r\n\r\n  In about 10 days the insect made its appearance through a hole in\r\n  the upper end, as represented in 13. The top was eaten off in a\r\n  perfect circle and hung by a few threads, so as to resemble a lid as\r\n  it was thrown back.\r\n\r\n  One caterpillar observed had between 300 and 400 cocoons on its back\r\n  and sides, and another was dissected after more than 30 larvæ had\r\n  escaped, and 130 were discovered in the soft integuments of the\r\n  back.\r\n\r\n  The figures from 1 to 13 are magnified five diameters, but in order\r\n  to observe the spinning of the cocoon a power of 50 is required.\r\n  (Amer. Naturalist, xii, pp. 559, 560.)\r\n\r\n  Certain differences observed by W. A. Buckhout in a Microgaster\r\n  parasitic on the different species of Macrosila, are referred to in\r\n  the same volume, p. 752.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 573.—Body of larva of Lithocolletis. swollen and filled with\r\n    cocoons of Copidosoma, enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  While those chalcidid larvæ which feed internally on their host, as\r\n  a rule, transform into naked, more or less coarctate pupæ, Howard\r\n  states that the larvæ of Copidosoma, Bothriothorax, Homalotylus, and\r\n  perhaps others, which are much crowded within their host, cause a\r\n  marked inflation of the body of the latter (Figs. 573, 574). The\r\n  nature of this cocoon-like cell, and how it is produced, is unknown.\r\n  “Its structure shows it not to be silk, nor yet the last larval skin\r\n  of the parasite, and whether it is an adventitious tissue of the\r\n  host-larva or a secretion of the parasite, or is explicable upon\r\n  other grounds, I cannot say.”\r\n\r\n  The silken cocoon of an aphidiid ichneumon has been found by Miss\r\n  Murtfeldt, and also by Dr. Riley, under a rose aphid in which it had\r\n  lived, and referred by Howard to the genus Praon (Fig. 575).\r\n\r\n=Sanitary conditions observed by the honey-bee larva, and admission of\r\nair within the cocoon.=—Cheshire has observed that after the larva of\r\nthe honey-bee has spun its cocoon or silken lining of its cell, it\r\nobserves the following means of preserving cleanliness. The food given\r\nto the larva, especially during the latter part of the growing period,\r\ncontains much pollen, the cases of the grains of which consist of\r\ncellulose, which is indigestible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 574.—Coccinellid larva infested by _Homalotylus obscurus_,\r\n    enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 575.—Cocoon of Praon under the body of a dead Aphis,\r\n    enlarged.—This and Figs. 573 and 574 after Howard, from Insect Life.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 576.—Pupation of Proctotrupes in the body of a larva of a beetle,\r\n    representing a case mentioned by Dr. Sharp, where the parasites have\r\n    pupated on the outside of the host, a pair of each attached to\r\n    nearly each segment of the body of their host.—After Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “These cases, with other refuse matters, collect in quantity within\r\n  the bowel, which becomes distended, since it has no opening. The\r\n  imprisoned larva, having little more than enough room for turning,\r\n  must be freed of these objectionable residua.... In a word, the\r\n  larva turns its head upon its stomach, and pushes the former towards\r\n  the base of the cell until its position is reversed, the tail being\r\n  outwards; and, thus placed, it laps up all residue of food,\r\n  especially from its old clothes previously referred to, until they\r\n  are dried, and practically occupy no space. It now throws up its\r\n  stomach and bowel, with all their contents, and without detaching\r\n  them from its outer skin, which is moulted as before, but in this\r\n  instance to be pressed against the cell, so as to form for it an\r\n  interior lining. The dejectamenta of the bowel in this way lie\r\n  between the cast skin and cell-wall (as seen at _e_, Fig. 577), and\r\n  so the larva remains absolutely unsoiled. It now turns its head and\r\n  resumes its old position, joining its cocoon to the edges of its\r\n  last cast skin, so that its habitation is relined, it is cleansed,\r\n  and air can still pass to it through the imperceptible openings left\r\n  by the bees in the sealing. This point is of radical importance,\r\n  since breathing is carried on pretty rapidly during the latter part\r\n  of its subsequent transformations, the absorbed oxygen permitting\r\n  then of a production of heat, and causing also considerable\r\n  diminution in weight.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 577.—Larva and pupa of honey-bee in their cell: _SL_,\r\n    spinning-larva; _N_, pupa; _FL_, young feeding larva; _co_, cocoon;\r\n    _sp_, spiracles; _t_, tongue; _m_, mandible; _an_, antenna; _w_,\r\n    wing; _ce_, compound eye; _e_, excrement; _ex_, exuvium.—After\r\n    Cheshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs to the passage of air into the bee’s cocoon, Cheshire states that\r\nbefore the cocoon can be built, a cover, technically called sealing, is\r\nput over the larva by its nurses. These covers are made of pollen and\r\nwax, and are pervious to the air. They are more convex and regular in\r\nform than those sealing in the honey.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PUPA STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word _pupa_ is from the Latin meaning baby. Linnæus gave it this\r\nname from its resemblance to a baby which has been swathed or bound up,\r\nas is still the custom in Southern Europe. The term _pupa_ should be\r\nrestricted to the resting inactive stage of the holometabolous insects.\r\n\r\n  Lamarck’s term _chrysalis_ was applied to the complete or obtected\r\n  pupa of Lepidoptera and of certain Diptera, and _mumia_, a mummy, to\r\n  the pupæ of Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and most Hymenoptera. Latreille\r\n  (1830) also restricted the term pupa to the “oviform nymph,” or\r\n  puparium, of Diptera. Brauer applies the term _nymph_ to the pupa of\r\n  metabolous insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 578.—Pupa obtecta: _a_, of Sesia, with its cocoon-cutter on the\r\n    head; _b_, of _Tortrix vacciniivorana_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe typical pupa is that of a moth or butterfly, popularly called a\r\nchrysalis. A lepidopterous pupa in which the appendages are more or less\r\nfolded close to the body and soldered to the integument, was called by\r\nLinnæus a _pupa obtecta_; and when the limbs are free, as in Neuroptera,\r\nMecoptera, Trichoptera, and the lepidopterous genus Micropteryx it is\r\ncalled a _pupa libera_ (Fig. 579). When the pupa is enclosed in the old\r\nlarval skin, which forms a pupal covering (puparium), the pupa was said\r\nby Linnæus to be _coarctate_. The pupa of certain Diptera, as that of\r\nthe orthoraphous families, is nearly as much obtected as that of the\r\ntineoid families of moths, especially as regards the appendages of the\r\nhead; the legs being more as in _pupæ liberæ_ (Fig. 580).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 579.—Pupa libera of neuropterous insects _a_, _Corydalus\r\n    cornutus_; _b_, Sialis; _c_, Hemerobius.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe male Coccid anticipates the metabolous insects in passing through a\r\nquiescent state, when, as Westwood states, it is “covered by the skin of\r\nthe larva, or by an additional pellicle.” The body appears to be broad\r\nand flat, the antennæ and fore legs resting under the head, while the\r\ntwo hinder pairs of legs are appressed to the under side of the body.\r\nThere is but a slight approach to the pupa libera of a metabolous\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n  Riley states that the male larva of _Icerya purchasi_ forms a cocoon\r\n  waxy in character, but lighter, more flossy, and less adhesive than\r\n  that of the female egg-cocoon. It melts and disappears when heated,\r\n  proving its entirely waxy nature. When the mass has reached the\r\n  proper length, the larva casts its skin, which remains in the hind\r\n  end of the cocoon, and pushes itself forward into the middle of the\r\n  cocoon. The pupa (Fig. 581) is of the same general form and size as\r\n  the larva. All the limbs are free and slightly movable, so that they\r\n  vary in position, though ordinarily the antennæ are pressed close to\r\n  the side, as are the wing-pads; the front pair of legs are extended\r\n  forward. “If disturbed, they twist and bend their bodies quite\r\n  vigorously.” The pupa state lasts two or three weeks. A similar pupa\r\n  is that of _Icerya rosæ_. (Riley and Howard.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 580.—Pupa obtecta of Diptera: _a_, Ptychoptera; _b_, _Tabanus\r\n    atratus_; _c_, _Proctacanthus philadelphicus_; _d_, _Midas\r\n    clavatus_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 581.—Pupa libera of _Icerya purchasi_, ventral view.—After\r\n    Riley, Insect Life.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The metamorphosis of _Aspidiotus perniciosus_ is of interest. The\r\n  male nymph differs much after the first moult from the female,\r\n  having large purple eyes, while the female nymph loses its eyes\r\n  entirely. It passes into what Riley terms the _pro-pupa_ (Fig. 582,\r\n  _b_), in which the wing-pads are present, while the limbs are short\r\n  and thick. The next stage is the “true pupa” (Fig. 582, _c_, _d_),\r\n  in which the antennæ and legs are much longer than before. There is\r\n  no waxy cocoon, but only a case or scale composed of the shed larval\r\n  skin, i.e. “with the first moult the shed larval skin is retained\r\n  beneath the scale, as in the case of the female; with the later\r\n  moultings the shed skins are pushed out from beneath the scale,” and\r\n  when they transform into the imago they “back out from the rear end\r\n  of their scale.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 582.—_Aspidiotus perniciosus_, development of male insect: _a_,\r\n    ventral view of larva after first moult; _b_, the same, after\r\n    second moult (pro-pupa stage); _c_ and _d_, true pupa, ventral and\r\n    dorsal views. All greatly enlarged.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pupæ of Coleoptera and of Hymenoptera, though there is, apparently,\r\nno near relationship between these two orders, are much alike in shape,\r\nand, as Chapman pertinently suggests, those of both orders are helpless\r\nfrom their quiescence, and hence have resorted for protection to some\r\ncocoon or cell.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite otherwise with the pupæ of Lepidoptera and Diptera,\r\nwhich vary so much in adaptation to their surroundings, and hence afford\r\nimportant taxonomical and phylogenetic characters. This, as regards the\r\nLepidoptera, was almost wholly overlooked until Chapman called attention\r\nto the subject, and showed that the pupæ had characters of their own, of\r\nthe greatest service in working out the classification, and hence the\r\nphylogeny, of the different lepidopterous groups. We have, following the\r\nlead of Chapman, found the most striking confirmation of his views, and\r\napplied our present knowledge of pupal structures to dividing the\r\nhaustellate Lepidoptera into two groups,—Paleolepidoptera and\r\nNeolepidoptera.\r\n\r\nThe pupæ of the Neuroptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera differ\r\nstructurally from the imago, in the parts of the head and thorax being\r\nless differentiated. Thus in the head the limits or sutures between the\r\nepicranium and clypeus, and the occiput and gula, are obscurely marked,\r\nwhile the tergal and pleural sclerites of the imago are not well\r\ndifferentiated until the changes occurring just before the final\r\necdysis.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, however, to homologize the appendages of the pupæ with those\r\nof the imago of all the holometabolous orders except in the case of the\r\nobtected pupa of the Lepidoptera (and probably of the obtected dipterous\r\npupæ), where the cephalic appendages are soldered together.\r\n\r\nThat the appendages of the lepidopterous pupa are, as generally\r\nsupposed, merely cases for those of the imago has been shown by Poulton\r\nto be quite erroneous. He says: “If we examine a section of a pupal\r\nantenna or leg (in Lepidoptera), we shall find that there is no trace of\r\nthe corresponding imaginal organ until shortly before the emergence of\r\nthe imago. In the numerous species with a long pupal period, the\r\nformation of imaginal appendages within those of the pupa is deferred\r\nuntil very late, and then takes place rapidly in the lapse of a few\r\nweeks. This also strengthens the conclusion that such pupal appendages\r\nare not mere cases for the parts of the imago, inasmuch as these latter\r\nare only contained within them for a very small proportion of the whole\r\npupal period.” On the other hand, Miall and Hammond claim that there is\r\na strong superficial contrast as to the formation of the imaginal\r\norgans, between Lepidoptera and tipularian Diptera, the appendages,\r\nwings, and compound eyes being substantially those of the imago. “With\r\nthe exception of the prothoracic respiratory appendages and the\r\ntail-fin, there is little in the pupa of Chironomus which does not\r\nrelate to the next stage.”\r\n\r\nThe exact homology of the “glazed eye” of the lepidopterous pupæ and of\r\nthe parts under the head, situated over the maxillæ, is difficult to\r\ndecide upon, and these points need farther examination. In the dipterous\r\npupa it is interesting to observe that the halteres are large and broad,\r\nwhich plainly indicates that they are modified hind wings. The number\r\nand arrangement of the spiracles is different in pupæ from those of the\r\nlarva and imago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 583.—_Simulium piscicidium_: _a_, larva; _b_, _c_, _d_, pupa;\r\n    _e_, thoracic leg; _f_, row of bristles at end of body. _A_, _S.\r\n    pecuarum_, pupa; _a_, _b_, _c_, adminicula.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are also secondary adaptive structures peculiar to the pupa, which\r\nare present and only of use in this stage. These are the thoracic,\r\nspiracular, or breathing appendages of the aquatic Diptera (Fig. 583),\r\nthe various spines situated on the head or thorax, or on the sides, or\r\nmore often at the end of the abdomen, besides also the little spines\r\narranged in more or less circular rows around the abdominal segments,\r\nthe cocoon-breaker, and the cremaster of many pupæ.\r\n\r\nIn the pupa of certain Diptera, there is a terminal cremaster-like\r\nspine, as in that of _Tipula eluta_ (Fig. 584), _Tabanus lineola_ (Fig.\r\n585), besides adminicula or locomotive spines like those of\r\nlepidopterous pupæ (Fig. 580, _a_, _b_, _c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 584.—Pupa of _Tipula eluta_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 585.—Pupa of _Tabanus lineola_.—This and Fig. 584 after Hart.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 586.—Pupa of _Galerita lecontei_, and of _Adelops hirtus_ (_a_,\r\n    _b_, _c_).—After Hubbard.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pupæ of Coleoptera are variously spined or hairy (Fig. 586). Those\r\nof Hydrophilus and of Hydrobius are provided with stout spines on the\r\nprothorax and abdomen which support the body in its cells, so that, as\r\nLyonet first showed, though surrounded on all sides by moist earth, it\r\nis kept from contact with it by the pupal spines; other pupæ of beetles,\r\nsuch as that of the plum weevil, which is also subterranean, possess\r\nsimilar spines. The abdomen of many coleopterous pupæ, such as those of\r\nCarabidæ, end in two spines, to aid them in escaping from their cells in\r\nwood or in the earth; others have stiff bristles, and others spines\r\nalong each side of the abdomen (Fig. 586). All these structures are the\r\nresult of a certain amount of activity in what we call quiescent pupæ,\r\nbut most of these are for use at the end of pupal life, at the critical\r\nmoment when by their aid the insect escapes from its cocoon or\r\nsubterranean cell, or if parasitic, bores out of its host.\r\n\r\nIf we are to account for the causes of their origin, we are obliged to\r\ninfer that they are temporary deciduous structures due to the need of\r\nsupport while the body is subjected to unusual strains and stresses in\r\nworking its way out of its prison in the earth, or its cell within the\r\nstems and trunks of plants and similar situations. They are pupal\r\ninheritances or heirlooms, and well illustrate the inheritance of\r\ncharacters acquired during a certain definite, usually brief, period of\r\nlife, and transmitted by the action of synchronous heredity.\r\n\r\nThe pupæ of certain insects are quite active, thus that of Raphidia,\r\nunlike that of Sialis, before its final ecdysis regains its activity and\r\nis able to run about. (Sharp, p. 448.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     _a._ The pupa considered in reference to its adaptation to its\r\n               surroundings and its relation to phylogeny\r\n\r\nThe form of the pupa is a very variable one, as even in Lepidoptera it\r\nis not entirely easy to draw the line between a pupa libera and a pupa\r\nobtecta (Fig. 578); and though the period is one of inactivity, yet when\r\nthey are not in cocoons or in the earth in subterranean cells, their\r\nform is more or less variable and adapted to changes in their\r\nsurroundings. Even in the obtected pupa of butterflies, there is, as\r\nevery one knows, considerable variability of shape and of armature,\r\nwhich seems to be in direct adaptability to the nature of their\r\nenvironment. Scudder has well shown that in certain chrysalids, such as\r\nthose of the Nymphalidæ, which are variously tuberculated, and hang\r\nsuspended by the tail, and often hibernate, these projections serve to\r\nprotect the body. All chrysalids with projections or ridges on different\r\nparts of the body, being otherwise unprotected, move freely when struck\r\nby gusts of wind, hence “the greater the danger to the chrysalis from\r\nsurrounding objects, the greater its protection by horny tubercles and\r\nroughened callous ridges.” The greater the protection possessed in other\r\nways, as by firm swathing or a safe retreat, the smoother the surface of\r\nthe body and the more regular and rounded its contours. The tendency to\r\nprotection by tubercles is especially noticeable in certain South\r\nAmerican chrysalids of nymphalid butterflies. This response to the\r\nstimuli of blows or shocks is also accompanied by a sensitiveness to the\r\nstimulus of too strong light.\r\n\r\nPreviously Scudder[103] had made the important suggestion that the\r\nsmooth crescent-shaped belt of the “glazed eye” or “eyepiece” of\r\nchrysalids is, as an external covering of the eye, midway between that\r\nof the caterpillar and the perfect insect, and he asks: “May it not be a\r\nrelic of the past, the external organ of what once was? And are we to\r\nlook upon this as our hint that the archaic butterfly in its\r\ntransformations passed through an _active_ pupal stage, like the lowest\r\ninsect of to-day, when its limbs were unsheathed, its appetite\r\nunabated?” etc. Scudder also shows that “the expanded base of the sheath\r\ncovering the tongue affords protection also to the palpi which lie\r\nbeneath and beside the tongue.”\r\n\r\nAll this tends to show the importance of studying the structure of the\r\npupa, in order to ascertain how the pupal structures have been brought\r\nabout, with the final object of discovering whether the pupæ of the\r\nholometabolic insects are not descended from active nymphs, and if so,\r\nthe probable course of the line of descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _b._ Mode of escape of the pupa from its cocoon\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 587.—Pupa of _Micropteryx purpuriella_, front view: _md_,\r\n    mandibles; _mx. p_, maxillary palpus, end drawn separately; _mx.′\r\n    p_, labial palpi; _lb_, labrum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In all protected pupæ,” as Chapman says, “the problem has to be faced,\r\nhow is the imago to free itself from the cocoon or other envelope\r\nprotecting the pupa.” In the Coleoptera and Hymenoptera the imago\r\nbecomes perfected within the cocoon or cell, as the case may be, and as\r\nChapman states, “not only throws off the pupal skin within the cocoon,\r\nbut remains there till its appendages have become fully expanded and\r\ncompletely hardened, and then the mandibles are used to force an outlet\r\nof escape,” and he calls attention to the fact that “in many cases, even\r\nin some entire families, they are of no use whatever to the imago except\r\nin this one particular,” and he cites the Cynipidæ as perhaps the most\r\nstriking instance of this circumstance.\r\n\r\nIn those Neuroptera which spin a silken cocoon, _e.g._ the Hemerobiidæ,\r\nthe Trichoptera, and in Micropteryx (Fig. 588), the jaws used by the\r\npupa for cutting its way out of the cocoon are even larger in proportion\r\nthan in the pupa of caddis-flies (Fig. 588), being of extraordinary\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 588.—Mandibles (_md_) of _Micropteryx purpuriella_,\r\n    enlarged.—Author _del._ _A_, pupal head of a hydropsychid\r\n    caddis-fly, showing the large mandibles.—After Reaumur, from Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Myrmeleon the pupa pushes its way half out of the cocoon, and then\r\nremains, while the imago ruptures the skin and escapes (Fig. 589, _a_).\r\n\r\nThus in the Neuroptera and Trichoptera we have already established the\r\nmore fundamental methods of escape from the cocoon, which we see carried\r\nout in various ways in the more generalized or primitive Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive method in the Lepidoptera of escaping from the cocoon\r\nseems to be that of Micropteryx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 589.—Larva of Myrmeleon with (_a_) its cocoon and cast pupa-skin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “In this genus,” says Chapman, “though it is nominally the pupa that\r\n  escapes from the cocoon, it is in reality still the imago, the imago\r\n  clothed in the effete pupal skin. To rupture the cocoon it uses not\r\n  its own jaws, but those of the pupal skin, energizing them, however,\r\n  in some totally different way from ordinary direct muscular action,\r\n  their movements being the result of the vermicular movements of the\r\n  pupa, acting probably by fluid pressure on the articular structure\r\n  of the jaws, by some arrangement not altogether different perhaps\r\n  from the frontal sac of the higher Diptera. In the Micropteryges the\r\n  jaws of the pupa not only rupture the cocoon, but appear to be the\r\n  most active agents in dragging the pupa through the opening in the\r\n  cocoon and through any superincumbent earth, being merely assisted\r\n  by the vermicular action of the abdominal segments, and we find in\r\n  accordance with this circumstance that the pupal envelope is still\r\n  very thin and delicate, and has little or no hardening or roughness\r\n  by which to obtain a leverage against the walls of the channel of\r\n  escape.” (Trans. Ent. Soc. London, 1896, pp. 570, 571.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 590.—Pupa of Talæporia: _a_, cocoon-cutter; with vestiges of four\r\n    pairs of abdominal legs, and the cremaster.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSome sort of a beak or hard process, more or less developed, according\r\nto Chapman, adapted for breaking open the cocoon exists in nearly all\r\nthe Lepidoptera with incomplete pupæ (_pupæ incompletæ_), except the\r\nlimacodid and nepticulid section. “In all these instances the pupa\r\nemerges from the cocoon precisely as in the Micropteryges, that is, the\r\nmoth it really is that emerges, but does so encased in the pupal skin.\r\nTo achieve this object, it seems to have been found most efficient to\r\nhave three, four, or five abdominal segments capable of movement, but to\r\nhave the terminal sections (segments) soldered together.”\r\n\r\nThis cocoon-breaker, as we may call it, is especially developed in\r\n_Lithocolletis hamadryadella_. As described by Comstock, it forms a\r\ntoothed crest on the forehead which enables it to pierce or saw through\r\nthe cocoon.\r\n\r\n  “Each pupa first sawed through the cocoon near its juncture with the\r\n  leaf and worked its way through the gap, by means of the minute\r\n  backward-directed spines upon its back, until it reached the upper\r\n  cuticle of the leaf. Through this cuticle it sawed in the same way\r\n  that it did through the cocoon. The hole was in each case just large\r\n  enough to permit the chrysalis to work its way out, holding it\r\n  firmly when partly emerged. When half-way out it stopped, and\r\n  presently the skin split across the back of the neck and down in\r\n  front along the antennal sheaths, and allowed the moth to\r\n  emerge.”[104]\r\n\r\nWe have observed and figured the cocoon-breaker in Bucculatrix,\r\nTalæporia (Fig. 590, _a_), Thyridopteryx, and Œceticus, and rough knobs\r\nor slight projection answering the purpose in Hepialidæ, Megalopyge,\r\nZeuzera, and in Datana.[105] See also the spine on the head of _Sesia\r\ntipuliformis_ (Fig. 578).\r\n\r\nThe imago of the attacine moths cuts or saws through its cocoon by means\r\nof a pair of large, stout, black spines (_sectores coconis_), one on\r\neach side of the thorax at the base of the fore wings (Fig. 591), and\r\nprovided with five or six teeth on the cutting edge (_C_, _D_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 591.—Cocoon-cutter of the Luna moth: front view of the moth with\r\n    the shoulders elevated and the rudimentary wings hanging down: _s_,\r\n    cocoon-cutter; _p_, patagium. _B_, represents another specimen with\r\n    fully developed wings: _ms_, scutum; _st_, scutellum of the\r\n    mesothoracic segment; _s_, cocoon-cutter, which is evidently a\r\n    modification of one of the pieces at the base of the fore wings; it\r\n    is surrounded by membrane, allowing free movement. _C_ and _D_,\r\n    different views of the spine, magnified, showing the five or six\r\n    irregular teeth on the cutting edge.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 592.—Larva and pupa of a wood-wasp (Rhopalum), enlarged: _h_,\r\n    temporary locomotive tubercles on head of pupa.—Trouvelot _del._\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Our attention[106] was drawn to this subject by a rustling, cutting,\r\n  and tearing noise issuing from a cocoon of _Actias luna_. On\r\n  examination a sharp black point was seen moving to and fro, and then\r\n  another, until both points had cut a rough irregular slit, through\r\n  which the shoulder of the moth could be seen vigorously moving from\r\n  side to side. The hole or slit was made in one or two minutes, and\r\n  the moth worked its way at once out of the slit. The cocoon was\r\n  perfectly dry. The cocoon-cutter occurs in all the American genera,\r\n  in _Samia cynthia_, and is large and well marked in the European\r\n  _Saturnia pavonia-minor_ and _Endromis versicolora_. In _Bombyx\r\n  mori_ the spines are not well marked, and they are quite different\r\n  from those in the Attaci. There are three sharp points, being acute\r\n  angles of the pieces at the base of the wing, and it must be these\r\n  spines which at times perform the cutting through of the threads of\r\n  the cocoon described by Réaumur, and which he thought was done by\r\n  the facets of the eyes. It is well known that in order to guard\r\n  against the moths cutting the threads, silkraisers expose the cocoon\r\n  to heat sufficient to destroy the enclosed pupa. In Platysamia the\r\n  cocoon-cutters, though well developed, do not appear to be used at\r\n  all, and the pupa, like that of the silkworm and other moths\r\n  protected by a cocoon, moistens the silk threads by a fluid issuing\r\n  from the mouth, which also moistens the hairs of the head and\r\n  thorax, together with the antennæ. It remains to be seen whether\r\n  these structures are only occasionally used, and whether the\r\n  emission of the fluid is not the usual and normal means of egress of\r\n  the moth from its cocoon. Dr. Chapman remarks that throughout the\r\n  obtected moths “there are many devices for breaking through the\r\n  cocoon: specially constructed weak places in the cocoon, softening\r\n  fluid, applied by the moth, assisted by special appliances of\r\n  diverse sorts, such as in Hybocampa[107] and Attacus,” etc.\r\n\r\n  As to the fluid mentioned above, Trouvelot states that it is\r\n  secreted during the last few days of the pupa state, and is a\r\n  dissolvent for the gum so firmly uniting the fibres of the cocoon.\r\n  “This liquid is composed in great part of bombycic acid.” (Amer.\r\n  Naturalist, i, p. 33.)\r\n\r\n  The pupa of the dipterous genus Sciara (_S. ocellaris_ O. S.)\r\n  resembles a tineid pupa, and before transforming emerges for about\r\n  two-thirds of its length from the cocoon; the pupa-skin remaining\r\n  firmly attached in this position.[108]\r\n\r\n  Certain hymenopterous pupæ are provided with temporary deciduous\r\n  conical processes. Thus we have observed in the pupa of _Rhopalum\r\n  pedicellatum_ two very prominent acute tubercles between the eyes\r\n  (_h_, Fig. 592). As the cocoon is very slight, these may be of use\r\n  either in extracting itself from the silken threads or in pushing\r\n  its way along before emerging from the tunnel in the stem of plants.\r\n  (See also p. 611.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _c._ The cremaster\r\n\r\nAlthough this structure is in general confined to lepidopterous pupæ,\r\nand is not always present even in them, since it is purely adaptive in\r\nits nature, yet on account of its singular mode of development from the\r\nlarval organs, and the accompanying changes in the pupal abdomen, it\r\nshould be mentioned in this connection. The cremaster is the stout,\r\ntriangular, flattened, terminal spine of the abdomen, which aids the\r\npupa in working its way out of the earth when the pupa is subterranean,\r\nor in the pupa of silk-spinning caterpillars its armature of secondary\r\nhooks and curved setæ enables it to retain its hold on the threads of\r\nthe interior of its cocoon after the pupa has partially emerged from the\r\ncocoon, restraining it, as Chapman well says, “at precisely that degree\r\nof emergence from the cocoon that is most desirable.” He also informs us\r\nthat while in the “_pupæ incompletæ_ the cremaster is attached to an\r\nextensible cable, which always allows some emergence of the pupa, in the\r\npupæ obtectæ there is no doubt but that in such cases as the Ichthyuræ,\r\nAcronyctæ, and many others, it retains the pupal case in the same\r\nposition within the cocoon that the living pupa occupied; this is also\r\nvery usually the case in the Geometræ and in the higher tineids (my\r\npyraloids).”\r\n\r\n  In many of the more generalized moths there is no cremaster\r\n  (Micropteryx, Gracilaria, Prodoxus, Tantura, Talæporia, Psychidæ,\r\n  Hepialidæ, Zeuzera, Nola, Harrisina), though in Tischeria and\r\n  Talæporia (Fig. 590, but not in Solenobia) and Psychidæ, two stout\r\n  terminal spines perform the office of a cremaster, or there are\r\n  simply curved setæ on the rounded, unarmed end of the abdomen, as in\r\n  Solenobia.\r\n\r\n  In the obtected Lepidoptera, for example in such a group as the\r\n  Notodontidæ, where the cremaster is present, though variable in\r\n  shape, it may from disuse, owing to the dense cocoon, be without the\r\n  spines and hooks in Cerura, or the cremaster itself is entirely\r\n  wanting in Gluphisia, and only partially developed in Notodonta. In\r\n  the butterflies whose pupæ are suspended (Suspensi), the cremaster\r\n  is especially well developed. Reference might here be made to the\r\n  temporary pupal structures in certain generalized moths, which take\r\n  the place of a cremaster, such as the transverse terminal row of\r\n  spines in Tinea, the two stout spines in Tischeria, and the dense\r\n  rough integument and thickened callosities of the pupal head and end\r\n  of abdomen of Phassus, which bores in trees with very hard wood;\r\n  also the numerous stout spines at the end and sides of the abdomen\r\n  in Ægerians. These various projections and spines, besides acting as\r\n  anchors and grappling hooks, in some cases serve to resist strains\r\n  and blows, and have undoubtedly, like the armature in the larvæ and\r\n  imagines of other insects, arisen in response to intermittent or\r\n  occasional pressure, stresses, and impacts.\r\n\r\n=Mode of formation of the cremaster and suspension of the chrysalis in\r\nbutterflies.=—We are indebted to Riley[109] for an explanation of the\r\nway the cremaster has originated, his observations having been made on\r\nspecies of over a dozen genera of butterflies (Suspensi).\r\n\r\nHe shows that the cremaster is the homologue of the suranal plate of the\r\nlarva.[110] The preliminary acts of the larva have been observed by\r\nvarious authors since the days of Vallisneri, _i.e._ the larva hanging\r\nby the end of the abdomen, turning up the anterior part of the body in a\r\nmore or less complete curve, and the skin finally splitting from the\r\nhead to the front edge of the metathoracic segment, and being worked\r\nback in a shrivelled mass toward the point of attachment. The critical\r\nfeat, adds Riley, which has most puzzled naturalists, is the independent\r\nattachment of the chrysalis and the withdrawal from and riddance of the\r\nlarval skin which such attachment implies. Réaumur explained this in\r\n1734 by the clutching of the larval skin between sutures of the terminal\r\nsegments of the chrysalis, and this is the case, though the sutures act\r\nin a somewhat different way.\r\n\r\n  Before pupation the larva spins a mass or heap of silk, the shape of\r\n  which is like an inverted settee or a ship’s knee, and “one of the\r\n  most interesting acts of the larva, preliminary to suspension, is\r\n  the bending and working of the anal parts in order to fasten the\r\n  back of the (suranal) plate to the inside of the back of the settee,\r\n  while the crotchets of the legs are entangled in the more flattened\r\n  position or seat.”\r\n\r\n  In shedding the larval skin, the following parts are also shed, and\r\n  have some part to play in the act of suspension: _i.e._ 1st, the\r\n  tracheal ligaments (Fig. 593, _tl_), or the shed tracheæ from the\r\n  last or 9th pair of spiracles; 2d, the rectal ligament (Fig. 593,\r\n  _rl_), or shed intestinal canal; 3d, the Osborne or retaining\r\n  membrane (_membrana retinens_, Fig. 593, _mr_), which is the\r\n  stretched part of the membrane around the rectum and in the anal\r\n  legs, and which is intimately associated with the rectal ligament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 593.—Shrunken larval skin of _Vanessa antiopa_, cut open from\r\n    the back and showing (_mr_) the retaining membrane, (_rl_) the\r\n    rectal ligament, and (_tl_) the tracheal ligaments.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The structures in the chrysalis are, first, the cremaster, with its\r\n  dorsal (Fig. 594, _dcr_) and ventral (_vcr_) ridges, and the\r\n  cremastral hook-pad (_chp_), said by Riley to be “thickly studded\r\n  with minute but stout hooks, which are sometimes compound or\r\n  furnished with barbs, very much as are some of our fishing-hooks,\r\n  and which are most admirably adapted to the purpose for which they\r\n  are intended.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 594.—Ideal representation of the anal subjoint of _Vanessa\r\n    antiopa_, from behind, with the spines removed, and all parts\r\n    forced apart by pressure so as to show the homologies of the parts\r\n    in the chrysalis which are concerned in pupation: homologies\r\n    indicated by corresponding letters in Fig. 595, except that _r_\r\n    (the rectum) corresponds with _pr_ in Fig. 595.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 595.—Anal parts of chrysalis of _Vanessa antiopa_, just prior\r\n    to final extraction from shrunken larval skin: _c_, cremaster;\r\n    _chp_, cremastral hook-pad; _h_, one of the hooks, more enlarged;\r\n    _vcr_, ventral cremastral ridge; _dcr_, dorsal cremastral ridge;\r\n    _lr_, larval rectum; _pr_, pupal rectum; _rp_, rectal plate; _sr_,\r\n    sustentor ridges; _mr_, _membrana retinens_; _rl_, rectal\r\n    ligament; _tl_, tracheal ligament; the 11th or last\r\n    spiracle-bearing joint and the 12th joint being numbered.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Secondly, there are the other structures, viz., the sustainers\r\n  (_sustentors_), two projections which Riley states “homologize with\r\n  the soles (_plantæ_) of the anal prolegs, which take on various\r\n  forms (3), but are always directed forward so as easily to catch\r\n  hold of the retaining membrane.” These sustentors are, however, as\r\n  Jackson[111] has shown, and as we are satisfied, the vestiges of the\r\n  anal legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 596.—_A_, chrysalis of Terias. _B_, posterior end of chrysalis\r\n    of Paphia. _C_, posterior end of chrysalis of Danais. _E_, one of\r\n    the sustainers of Terias, greatly enlarged to show its hooked\r\n    nature.

In all the figures the joints of the body are\r\n    numbered; the forming chrysalis is shaded in transverse lines; the\r\n    intervening space between it and larval skin is dotted: _h_, is\r\n    the hillock of silk; _hl_, hooks of hind legs; _ap_, anal plate;\r\n    _lr_, larval rectum; _pr_, pupal rectum; _mr_, retaining membrane;\r\n    _c_, cremaster; _s_, sustainers.—This and Figs. 593–596 after\r\n    Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “It is principally,” adds Riley, “by the leverage obtained by the\r\n  hooking of the sustainers in the retaining membrane, which acts as a\r\n  swimming fulcrum, that the chrysalis is prevented from falling after\r\n  the cremaster is withdrawn from the larval skin. It is also\r\n  principally by this same means that it is enabled to reach the silk\r\n  with the cremastral hook-pads.”\r\n\r\n  “Dissected immediately after suspension, the last abdominal segment\r\n  of the larva is found to be bathed, especially between the legs and\r\n  around the rectum, in an abundance of translucent, membranous\r\n  material.”\r\n\r\n  “An hour or more after suspension the end of the forming chrysalis\r\n  begins to separate from the larval skin, except at the tip of the\r\n  cremaster (Fig. 597, _b_). Gradually the skin of the legs and of the\r\n  whole subjoint (10th segment) stretches, and with the stretching,\r\n  the cremaster elongates, the rectal piece recedes more and more from\r\n  the larval rectum, and the sustentor ridges diverge more and more\r\n  from the cremaster, carrying with them, on the sustainers, a part of\r\n  the soft membrane.” The rectal ligament will sustain at least 10 or\r\n  12 times the weight of the chrysalis. That of Apatura seems to rely\r\n  almost entirely on the rectal ligament, assisted by the partial\r\n  holding of the delicate larval skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   FORMATION OF THE PUPA AND IMAGO IN THE HOLOMETABOLOUS INSECTS (THE\r\n                           DIPTERA EXCEPTED)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the incomplete metamorphosis, although there may be\r\nas many as five, and possibly seven moults, and in Chloëon as many as\r\n20, and in _Cicada septemdecim_ perhaps 25 or 30, there is but a slight\r\nchange of form from one stage to another, and no period of inactivity.\r\nAnd this gradual outer transformation is so far as yet known paralleled\r\nby that of the internal organs, the slight successive changes of which\r\ndo not differ from those observed in the growth of ametabolous insects.\r\nWith the growth of the internal organs there probably goes on a series\r\nof gradual regenerative processes, and Korschelt and Heider state that\r\nwe may venture to assume that each changed cell or group of cells which\r\nhave become exhausted by the exercise of the functions of life are\r\nreabsorbed and become restored through the vital powers of the tissues,\r\nso that as the result there goes on a constant, gradual regeneration of\r\nthe organs.\r\n\r\nWhile the Hemiptera have only an incomplete metamorphosis, the males of\r\nthe Coccidæ are, as shown by O. Schmidt, remarkable for passing through\r\na complete or holometabolous development, with four stages, three of\r\nwhich are pupal and inactive. Hence, as Schmidt observes, there is here\r\na hypermetamorphosis, like that of the Meloidæ, Stylopidæ, etc.\r\n\r\nShortly before the end of the larval stage of the male appear the\r\nimaginal buds of the eyes, legs, and wings. In the 2d or 1st pupal stage\r\nthere is an atrophy of the antennæ and legs. On the other hand, at this\r\nstage the female completes its metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe rudiments of the wings arise on the edge of the dorsal and ventral\r\nside of the 2d thoracic segment, and this, we would remark, is\r\nsignificant as showing a mode of origin of the wings intermediate\r\nbetween that of the manometamorphic and holometamorphic insects. (See\r\npp. 137–142.) While Schmidt could not ascertain the exact structure of\r\nthe imaginal buds, he says “in general the process of formation of the\r\nextremities is exactly as Weismann has described in Corethra.” The two\r\nlater pupal stages are “as in other metabolic insects.” (See p. 690,\r\nFig. 637.)\r\n\r\nThus far the internal changes in the metamorphosis of the Coleoptera\r\nhave not been thoroughly studied. They are less complete than in the\r\nother holometabolous insects, the differences between the larva and\r\nimago being much less marked than in the more specialized orders, and so\r\nfar as known all the larval organs pass, though not without some great\r\nchanges, directly into the imaginal ones, the only apparent exception\r\nbeing the mid-intestine, which, as stated by Kowalevsky, undergoes a\r\ncomplete transformation during metamorphosis. The following account,\r\nthen, refers almost wholly to the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _a._ The Lepidoptera\r\n\r\nThe first observations on the complete metamorphosis of insects which\r\nwere in any way exact were those of Malpighi, in 1667, and of\r\nSwammerdam, in 1733. While the observations of Swammerdam, as far as\r\nthey extended, were correct, his conclusions were extraordinary. They\r\nwere, however, accepted by Réaumur and by Bonnet, and generally held\r\nuntil the time of Herold in 1815, and lingered on for some years after.\r\nThe rather famous theory of incasement (“_emboîtement_”) propounded by\r\nSwammerdam was that the form of the larva, pupa, and imago preëxisted in\r\nthe egg, and even in the ovary; and that the insects in these stages\r\nwere distinct animals, contained one inside the other, like a nest of\r\nboxes, or a series of envelopes one within the other, or, to use his own\r\nwords: “_Animal in animali, seu papilio intra erucam reconditus._”\r\n\r\nThis theory Swammerdam extended to the whole animal kingdom. It was\r\nbased on the fact that by throwing the caterpillar, when about to\r\npupate, in boiling water, and then stripping off the skin, the immature\r\nform of the butterfly with its appendages was disclosed. Malpighi had\r\npreviously observed the same fact in the silkworm, perceiving that\r\nbefore pupation the antennæ are concealed in the head of the larva,\r\nwhere they occupy the place previously taken by the mandibular muscles;\r\nalso that the legs of the moth grew in those of the larva, and that the\r\nwings developed from the sides of the worm.\r\n\r\nEven Réaumur (1734) remarked: “Les parties du papillon cachées sous le\r\nfourreau de chenille sont d’autant plus faciles à trouver que la\r\ntransformation est plus proche. Elles y sont neanmoins de tout temps.”\r\nHe also believed in the simultaneous existence of two distinct beings in\r\nthe insect. “Il serait très curieux de connaître toutes les\r\ncommunications intimes qui sont entre la chenille et le papillon.... La\r\nchenille hache, broye, digere les aliments qu’elle distribué au\r\npapillon; comme les mères préparent ceux qui sont portés aux fœtus.\r\nNotre chenille en un mot est destineé à nourrir et à defendre le\r\npapillon qu’elle renferme.” (T. i, 8^e Mémoire, p. 363.)\r\n\r\nLyonet (1760), even, did not expose the error of this view that the\r\nlarva enveloped the pupa and imago, and, as Gonin says, it was\r\nundoubtedly because he did not use for his dissections of the\r\ncaterpillar of Cossus any specimens about to pupate. Yet he detected the\r\nwing-germs and those of the legs, stating that he presumed the bodies he\r\nsaw to be the rudiments of the legs of the moth (p. 450).\r\n\r\nHerold, in his work on the development of the butterfly (1815), was the\r\nfirst to object to this erroneous theory, showing that the wings did not\r\nbecome visible until the very end of larval life; that as the larval\r\norgans disappear, they are transformed or are replaced by entirely new\r\norgans, which is not reconcilable with a simple putting off of the outer\r\nenvelope. The whole secret of metamorphosis, in Herold’s opinion,\r\nconsisted in this fact, that the butterfly in the larva state increases\r\nand accumulates a supply of fat until it has reached the volume of the\r\nperfect state; then it begins the chrysalis period, during which the\r\norgans are developed and take their definite form.[112] (Abstract mostly\r\nfrom Gonin.) Still the old ideas prevailed, and even Lacordaire, in his\r\nIntroduction à l’Entomologie published in 1834, held on to Swammerdam’s\r\ntheory, declaring that “a caterpillar is not a simple animal, but\r\ncompound,” and he actually goes so far as to say that “a caterpillar, at\r\nfirst scarcely as large as a bit of thread, contains its own teguments\r\nthreefold and even eightfold in number, besides the case of a chrysalis,\r\nand a complete butterfly, all lying one inside the other.” This view,\r\nhowever, we find is not original with Lacordaire, but was borrowed from\r\nKirby and Spence without acknowledgment. These authors, in their\r\nIntroduction to Entomology (1828), combated Herold’s views and stoutly\r\nmaintained the old opinions of Swammerdam. They based their opinions on\r\nthe fact, then known, that certain parts of the imago occur in the\r\ncaterpillar. On the other hand, Herold denied that the successive skins\r\nof the pupa and imago existed as germs, holding that they are formed\r\nsuccessively from the “_rete mucosum_,” which we suppose to be the\r\nhypodermis of later authors. In a slight degree the Swammerdam-Kirby and\r\nSpence doctrine was correct, as the imago does arise from germs, _i.e._\r\nthe imaginal disks of Weismann, while this was not discovered by Herold,\r\nthough they do at the outset arise from the hypodermis, his _rete\r\nmucosum_. Thus there was a grain of truth in the Swammerdam-Kirby and\r\nSpence doctrine, and also a mixture of truth and error in the opinions\r\nof Herold.\r\n\r\nThe real nature of the internal changes wrought during the process of\r\nmetamorphosis was first revealed by Weismann in 1864. His discovery of\r\nthe germs of the imago (imaginal buds) of the Diptera, and his theory of\r\n_histolysis_, or of the complete destruction of the larval organs by a\r\ngradual process, was the result of the application of modern methods of\r\nembryology and histology, although his observations were first made on\r\nthe extremely modified type of the Muscidæ or flies, and, at first, he\r\ndid not extend his view to include all the holometabolous insects. Now,\r\nthanks to his successors in this field, Ganin, Dewitz, Kowalevsky, Van\r\nRees, Bugnion, Gonin, and others, we see that metamorphosis is, after\r\nall, only an extension of embryonic life, the moults and great changes\r\nbeing similar to those undergone by the embryo, and that metamorphosis\r\nand alternation of generations are but terms in a single series.\r\nMoreover, the metamorphoses of insects are of the same general nature as\r\nthose of certain worms, of the echinoderms, and the frog, the different\r\nstages of larva, pupa, and imago being adaptational and secondary.\r\n\r\nWhile the changes in form from the larva to the pupa are apparently\r\nsudden, the internal histogenetic steps which lead to them are gradual.\r\nIn the Lepidoptera a few days (usually from one to three) before\r\nassuming the pupa stage, the caterpillar becomes restless and ceases to\r\ntake food. Its excrements are now hard, dry, and, according to Gonin,\r\nare “stained carmine red by the secretions of the urinary tubes.” Under\r\nthe microscope we find that they are almost exclusively composed of\r\nfragments of the intestinal epithelium. These red dejections were\r\nnoticed by Réaumur, and afterwards by Herold, and they are sure\r\nindications of the approach of the transformations. It now wanders\r\nabout, and, if it is a spinner, spins its cocoon, and then lies quietly\r\nat rest while the changes are going on within its body. Meanwhile, it\r\nlives on the stores of fat in the fat-body, and this supply enables it\r\nto survive the pupal period.\r\n\r\n  The amount of fat is sometimes very great. Newport removed from the\r\n  larva of _Cossus ligniperda_ 42 grains of fat, being more than\r\n  one-fourth of the whole weight of the insect, he adds that the\r\n  supply is soon nearly exhausted during the rapid development of the\r\n  reproductive organs, “since, when these have become perfected, the\r\n  quantity that remains is very inconsiderable.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the larval skin of a lepidopterous insect is suddenly cast off,\r\nthe pupa quickly emerging front it, yet there are several intermediate\r\nstages, all graduating into each other. If a caterpillar of a\r\nClisiocampa, which, as we have observed, is much shortened and thickened\r\na day or two before changing to a pupa, is hardened in alcohol and the\r\nlarval skin is stripped off, the semipupa (pro-nymph, pro-pupa of\r\ndifferent authors) is found to be in different stages of development,\r\nand the changes of the mouth-parts are interesting, though not yet\r\nsufficiently studied.\r\n\r\nNewport attributes the great enlargement and changes in the shape of the\r\nthoracic segments of the larva of _Vanessa urticæ_ at this time, to the\r\ncontraction or shortening of the muscles of the interior of those\r\nsegments, “which are repeatedly slowly extended and shortened, as if the\r\ninsect were in the act of laborious respiration.” This, he adds,\r\ngenerally takes place at short intervals during the two hours\r\nimmediately preceding the change to the pupa, and increases in frequency\r\nas that period approaches. He thus describes the mode of moulting the\r\nlarval skin: “When the period has arrived, the skin bursts along the\r\ndorsal part of the 3d segment, or mesothorax, and is extended along the\r\n2d and 4th, while the coverings of the head separate into three pieces.\r\nThe insect then exerts itself to the utmost to extend the fissure along\r\nthe segment of the abdomen, and, in the meantime, pressing its body\r\nthrough the opening, gradually withdraws its antennæ and legs, while the\r\nskin, by successive contortions of the abdomen, is slipped backwards,\r\nand forced towards the extremity of the body, just as a person would\r\nslip off his glove or his stocking. The efforts of the insect to get\r\nentirely rid of it are then very great; it twirls itself in every\r\ndirection in order to burst the skin, and, when it has exerted itself in\r\nthis manner for some time, twirls itself swiftly, first in one\r\ndirection, then in the opposite, until at last the skin is broken\r\nthrough and falls to the ground, or is forced to some distance from it.\r\nThe new pupa then hangs for a few seconds at rest, but its change is not\r\nyet complete. The legs and antennæ, which when withdrawn from the old\r\nskin were disposed along the under surface of the body, are yet\r\nseparate, and do not adhere together as they do a short time afterwards.\r\nThe wings are also separate and very small. In a few seconds the pupa\r\nmakes several slow, but powerful, respiratory efforts; during which the\r\nabdominal segments become more contracted along their under surface, and\r\nthe wings are much enlarged and extended along the lateral inferior\r\nsurface of the body, while a very transparent fluid, which facilitated\r\nthe slipping off of the skin, is now diffused among the limbs, and when\r\nthe pupa becomes quiet dries, and unites the whole into one compact\r\ncovering.”\r\n\r\n=The changes in the head and mouth-parts.=—The changes of form from the\r\nactive mandibulate caterpillar to the quiescent pupa, and then to the\r\nadult butterfly, are, as we have seen, in direct adaptation to their\r\nchanged habits and surroundings, and they differ greatly in details in\r\ninsects of different orders. In many Lepidoptera and certain Diptera the\r\npupa and imago are without the mandibles of the larva, and, instead, the\r\n1st maxillæ in the former order, and the 2d maxillæ in the latter, are\r\nhighly developed and specialized. The changes in the shape of the head,\r\nwith the antennæ, the latter rudimentary in the larvæ of the two orders\r\nnamed, are noteworthy, and will be referred to under those orders. The\r\nsame may be said of the thorax with the legs and wings, and the abdomen\r\nwith the ovipositor. Every part of the body undergoes a profound change,\r\nthough in the Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and the more generalized and\r\nprimitive Diptera, each segment and appendage of the larva are directly\r\ntransformed into the corresponding parts of the pupa, and subsequently\r\nof the imago. We shall see, however, beyond, that this general statement\r\ndoes not apply to the Hymenoptera, in which there is a process of\r\ncephalization or transfer of parts headward, peculiar to that order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 598.—Internal organs of _Sphinx ligustri_: 1, head; 2–4,\r\n    thoracic, 5–13, abdominal segments; _V_, fore-, _M_, mid-, _E_,\r\n    hind-intestine; _gs_, brain; _gi_, infraœsophageal ganglion; _n_,\r\n    ventral ganglion; _vm_, urinary tubes; _c_, heart; _G_, testis; _o_,\r\n    œsophagus; _a_, anus; _m_, alary muscles of the heart.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 599.—Pupa of the same.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 600.—Imago of the same.—This and Figs. 598 and 599 after Newport,\r\n    from Gegenbaur.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 601.—Nervous system of the larva of _Sphinx ligustri_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 602.—Nervous system of the pupa of _Sphinx ligustri_, soon after\r\n    pupation.—This and Fig. 601, after Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The change in the internal organs.=—These were especially, as regards\r\nthe nervous system, first carefully examined and illustrated by that\r\ngreat English entomotomist, Newport, and those of the reproductive\r\norgans by Herold as early as 1815. A glance at the figures (598–604),\r\nreproduced from Newport’s article Insecta, will show the changes wrought\r\nespecially in the digestive and nervous systems of Sphinx and Vanessa,\r\nhis account of the alterations in the muscles having already been\r\nquoted. As the pupal form is much nearer to that of the imago than of\r\nthe larva, so the digestive canal is seen to be nearly as much\r\ndifferentiated in the pupa as in the imago, though the reservoir\r\n(“sucking-stomach”) of the imago is not indicated in the pupa. These\r\nchanges are such as occur in an insect which is enormously voracious as\r\na larva, and which often, passing through a period of complete\r\ninactivity, taking no food at all, finally becomes an insect which needs\r\nto suck in only a minimum quantity of water or nectar, and which\r\npractically abstains from all food. The head and genital glands also, as\r\nwell as the urinary vessels, are nearly the same. On the other hand, the\r\nsalivary glands have undergone, in the imago, a thoroughgoing reduction.\r\n\r\nThe changes undergone by the nervous system of _Sphinx ligustri_ and\r\n_Vanessa urticæ_ have been described by Newport with fulness of detail.\r\nAn abstract of his observations on _Vanessa urticæ_, which undergoes its\r\nchanges in June in 14 days, and in August in eight days, we will now\r\ngive, in part verbatim, the subject being rendered much clearer by his\r\nfigures, which are reproduced.\r\n\r\n  During the last larval stage, certain changes have already taken\r\n  place in different parts of the cord, which shows that they had been\r\n  a long time in progress. Besides the lateral approximation of the\r\n  cords, the first change consists in a union of the 11th and 12th\r\n  ganglia, the latter one being carried forwards; these two ganglia\r\n  being entirely separate before the 3d moult.\r\n\r\n  Two hours after the larva of _Vanessa urticæ_ has suspended itself\r\n  in order to pupate, the brain is not yet enlarged, but the\r\n  subœsophageal ganglion is nearly twice its original size and the\r\n  ganglia behind are nearer together. “A little while before the old\r\n  larval skin is thrown off there is great excitement throughout the\r\n  body of the insect.” About half an hour (Fig. 603, 2) before this\r\n  occurs the alary nerves and the cerebral, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th\r\n  ganglia are slightly enlarged, and the 1st subœsophageal ganglion\r\n  very considerably. Immediately after the insect has entered the pupa\r\n  state (Fig. 603, 3), all the ganglia are brought closer together.\r\n  One hour after (Fig. 603, 4) pupation the cerebral ganglia are found\r\n  to be more closely united, the 4th and 5th ganglia are nearer, and\r\n  the distance between the remaining ganglia is also reduced.\r\n\r\n  Seven hours after pupation there is a greater enlargement of the\r\n  cerebral ganglia, optic nerves, and ganglia and cords of the future\r\n  thoracic segments.\r\n\r\n  At 12 hours (Fig. 603, 5) the 5th pair of ganglia has almost\r\n  completely coalesced with the cord and the 4th; at 18 hours (Fig.\r\n  603, 6) the whole of the ganglia, cords, and nerves have become more\r\n  enlarged, especially those of the wings, while the 4th and 5th\r\n  ganglia of the cords have now so completely united as to appear like\r\n  an irregular elongated mass. At 24 hours (Fig. 604, 7) the 4th and\r\n  5th ganglia are completely united, the 5th being larger than the\r\n  4th. At 36 hours (Fig. 604, 8) the optic nerves have attained a size\r\n  almost equal to that of the brain. The 1st subœsophageal ganglion\r\n  now forms, with the cerebral ones, a complete ring around the\r\n  œsophagus, the crura having almost disappeared. The 6th ganglion has\r\n  now disappeared, but the nerves arising from it remain. At 48 hours\r\n  (Fig. 604, 9) the cord is straight instead of being sinuous, and the\r\n  7th ganglion has disappeared, while the thoracic ganglia are greatly\r\n  enlarged. At the end of 58 hours the 2d and 3d thoracic ganglia have\r\n  united, and the double ganglion thus formed is only separated from\r\n  the large thoracic mass composed of the 4th, 5th, and part of the\r\n  6th ganglia, by the short but greatly enlarged cords which pass on\r\n  each side of the central attachment of the muscles. “The optic and\r\n  antennal nerves have nearly attained their full development, and\r\n  those numerous and most intricate plexus of nerves in the three\r\n  thoracic segments of the larva form only a few trunks, which can\r\n  hardly be recognized as the same structures. The arrangement of the\r\n  whole nervous system is now nearly as it exists in the perfect\r\n  insect. The whole of these important changes are thus seen to take\r\n  place within the first three days after the insect has undergone its\r\n  metamorphosis; and they precede those of the alimentary canal,\r\n  generative system, and other organs, which are still very far from\r\n  being completed, and indeed, as compared with the nervous system,\r\n  have made but little progress.” (Art. Insecta, pp. 962–965.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 603.—Changes in the nervous system of _Vanessa urticæ_, during\r\n    and after pupation.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 604.—Changes in the nervous system of _Vanessa urticæ_, from 24\r\n    to 58 hours after pupation.—After Newport.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe initial steps and many of the subsequent internal changes escaped\r\nthe notice of Newport and others of his time, and it was not until the\r\nepoch-making work of Weismann on the ultimate processes of\r\ntransformation of Corethra and of Musca, that we had an adequate\r\nknowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nWeismann (1864) was the first to show for the Muscidæ and Corethra that\r\nthe appendages, wings, and other parts of the imago originate in\r\nseparate, minute, cellular masses called imaginal disks, buds, or folds\r\n(histoblasts of Künckel). These imaginal buds, which arise from the\r\nhypodermis, being masses of indifferent cells, are usually present in\r\nthe very young larva, and even in the later embryonic stages. It has\r\nbeen shown that such imaginal buds exist for each part of the body, not\r\nonly for the appendages and wings (p. 126), but for the different\r\nsections of the digestive canal. During the semipupal stage these buds\r\nenlarge, grow, and at the same time there is a corresponding destruction\r\nof the larval organs. The process of destruction is due to the activity\r\nof the blood corpuscles or leucocytes (phagocytes), the larval organs\r\nthus broken up forming a creamy mass, the buds from which the new organs\r\nare to arise resisting the attacks of the virulent leucocytes, which\r\nattach themselves to the weakened tissue and engulf the pigments (see p.\r\n422). The two processes of destruction of the larval organs (histolysis)\r\nand the building up of the imaginal organs (histogenesis) go hand in\r\nhand, so that the connection of the organs in question in most cases\r\nremains entirely continuous; while the last steps in the destruction of\r\nthe larval organs only take place after the organs of the imago have\r\nassumed their definite shape and size. Other observers have corroborated\r\nand confirmed his statements and observations, Gonin extending them to\r\nthe Lepidoptera and Bugnion to the Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that the observations, such as were set on foot by\r\nWeismann, were not first made on the Trichoptera and Lepidoptera, which\r\nare much more primitive and unmodified forms than the Diptera, but\r\nmistakes of this nature have frequently happened in the history of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 605.—Full grown larva of _Pieris brassicæ_ opened along the\r\n    dorsal line: _d_, digestive canal; _s_, silk-gland; _g_, brain; _st\r\n    I_, prothoracic stigma; _st IV_, 1st abdominal stigma; _a_, _a′_,\r\n    germs (buds) of fore and hind wings; _p_, bud of thoracic\r\n    segment;—those of the 3d pair are concealed under the silk-glands;\r\n    _I_-_III_, thoracic rings.—After Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe latest and most detailed researches are those of J. Gonin on the\r\nmetamorphoses of _Pieris brassicæ_, made under the direction of\r\nProfessor E. Bugnion. They fill an important gap in our knowledge, and\r\nshow that the Lepidoptera transform in nearly the same manner as\r\ndescribed by Weismann in Corethra. We give the following condensed\r\naccount of Gonin’s observations.\r\n\r\nOn opening a caterpillar entering on the semipupa state (Fig. 605), the\r\nrelative position of the germs (imaginal buds or folds) of the wings and\r\nof the legs are seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 606.—Section through thorax of a tineid larva on sycamore,\r\n    passing through the 1st pair of wings (_w_): _ht_, heart; _i_,\r\n    œsophagus; _s_, salivary gland; _ut_, urinary tube; _nc_, nervous\r\n    cord; _m_, recti muscles; a part of the fat-body overlies the heart.\r\n    _A_, right wing-germ enlarged.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 607.—Section of the same specimen as in Fig. 606, but cut through\r\n    the 2d pair of wings (_w_): _i_, mid-intestine; h, heart; _fb_,\r\n    fat-body; _l_, leg; _n_, nervous cord.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese imaginal buds in a more advanced stage are seen in our sections of\r\na tineid larva (Figs. 606, 607).\r\n\r\nThe number of 12 imaginal buds found by Weismann in the thorax of\r\nMuscidæ does not occur in Lepidoptera, since, as in the Hymenoptera\r\n(Bugnion), the dorsal buds of the prothoracic segment are wanting. Gonin\r\nfinds in Pieris that the ventral buds of the three thoracic segments are\r\neach represented by several distinct folds attached to the femoro-tibial\r\nbud and to the tarsal joints.\r\n\r\nThe imaginal buds serve in some cases for the formation of new organs\r\n(wings, legs of insects with apodous larvæ); in others for the growth\r\nand the transformation of organs already existing (legs, antennæ, 1st\r\nand 2d maxillæ of Lepidoptera).\r\n\r\n  As to the peripodal sac or hypodermic envelope which contains the\r\n  imaginal bud, a portion persists and is regenerated, while the other\r\n  part becomes useless and is detached under the form of débris, as\r\n  shown by Weismann, Viallanes, and Van Rees in the Muscidæ. On this\r\n  point Gonin disagrees with Dewitz, who stated that the walls of the\r\n  wing-sacs are not destroyed, but are only gradually withdrawn at the\r\n  time of pupation, in order to allow the orifice to distend and let\r\n  the wing pass out to the exterior.\r\n\r\n  The portion of the sac which persists (basal portion, peripheral pad\r\n  of Bugnion, or annular zone of Künckel) serves at first to attach\r\n  the appendage, while forming, to the hypodermis of the larva, then\r\n  afterwards to more or less completely regenerate the adjoining\r\n  portion of the integument. In this way the hypodermis of the thorax\r\n  is partially, that of the head is almost entirely, replaced by the\r\n  imaginal epithelium which proliferates at the base of the\r\n  appendages,[113] while that of the abdominal segments persists, at\r\n  least in a modified way, and only undergoes (at the end of the pupal\r\n  period) transformations as regards the appearance of the scales and\r\n  pigment.\r\n\r\n=The wings.=—The imaginal buds of the wings do not participate in the\r\nlarval moults. Gonin has observed, contrary to Dewitz, that their\r\nsurface only forms a cuticle towards the end of the last larval stage.\r\n\r\nThe network of fine tracheæ of the wing-bud is drawn out at the time of\r\npupation with the internal cuticle of the large tracheæ. The permanent\r\ntracheæ of the wing have already appeared at the time of the 3d moult\r\nunder the form of large rectilinear trunks, the position of which\r\ncorresponds afterwards to that of the veins, but they are not filled\r\nwith air until the time of pupation. There are from eight to ten of\r\nthese tracheæ in each wing (Fig. 159), and they give rise in the pupa to\r\na new system of fine tracheæ (tracheoles) which replaces that of the\r\nlarva. (For further details the reader is referred to pp. 126–137.)\r\n\r\n=Development of the feet and the cephalic appendages.=[114]—In the\r\napodous larvæ of Diptera and Hymenoptera the rudiments of the legs are,\r\nlike those of the wings, developed within hypodermal sacs; at times they\r\nremain there up to the end of larval life, but sometimes they appear\r\nearly at the surface. This origin of the legs, thanks to Weismann,\r\nKünckel, and Van Rees, is well known in the Diptera; in the Hymenoptera\r\nit has been proved to be the case with ants by Dewitz, and in Encyrtus\r\nby Bugnion. As for the Lepidoptera our knowledge that the legs of the\r\nimago arise from the six thoracic legs of the caterpillar, up to the\r\ndate of Gonin’s paper has not been in advance of that of Malpighi and\r\nSwammerdam.\r\n\r\n  Réaumur, moreover, was supposed to have furnished the proof, having\r\n  from his experiments concluded that “if the legs of the pupa appear\r\n  longer and larger than those of the caterpillar wherein they were\r\n  contained, it is because they were folded and squeezed.” (8^e Mém.,\r\n  p. 365.)\r\n\r\n  This explanation of Réaumur’s has been generally accepted. Graber\r\n  (Die Insekten, p. 506) accepted it, after examining microscopic\r\n  sections of the legs, and Künckel averred that “Réaumur, having, in\r\n  certain caterpillars, completely cut off one of the thoracic legs,\r\n  had concluded that the butterfly which came from it lacked the\r\n  corresponding member.” (Rech. sur l’org. et dév. des volucelles, p.\r\n  160.)\r\n\r\n  Newport, it is true, denied this disappearance of the legs, but did\r\n  not wish to put himself in opposition to received ideas, and\r\n  supposed that the member cut off was partly reformed in the imago.\r\n\r\n  Künckel believes that he has found a better solution in his theory\r\n  of histoblasts or imaginal buds; in his opinion, “Réaumur and\r\n  Newport are both right,” but “when Réaumur cut off a caterpillar’s\r\n  leg, he at the same time removed the histoblast, the rudiment of the\r\n  leg of the butterfly. When Newport repeated this experiment, he\r\n  simply mutilated the histoblast without completely destroying it: in\r\n  the first case, the adult insect was born with one leg less; in the\r\n  second case, it appeared with an atrophied foot.”\r\n\r\n  “So ingenious an explanation,” says Gonin, “is not necessary.” To\r\n  prove that the experiments of the two savants are not contradictory,\r\n  it would have been sufficient to cite, as Künckel did not do, the\r\n  exact words of Réaumur, for he having cut from a caterpillar “more\r\n  than half of three of the thoracic legs on the same side,” says he\r\n  found that the chrysalis had “the three limbs on one side _shorter_\r\n  than the corresponding ones on the other side.” The same operation\r\n  repeated on a somewhat younger caterpillar again showed in the\r\n  chrysalis three maimed limbs, “so that they could not be said to be\r\n  entirely absent. These results are like those of Newport; the\r\n  interpretation only was faulty, as we shall attempt to prove.”\r\n\r\nThe real relations of the adult legs to the larval legs are thus shown\r\nby Gonin.\r\n\r\n“If we carefully strip off the skin of a caterpillar near the time of\r\npupation (Fig. 608), we see that the extremity only of the legs of the\r\nimago is drawn out of the larval legs; the other parts are pressed\r\nagainst each side of the thorax: near the ventral line a small pad\r\nrepresents the coxa and the trochanter; the femur and the tibia are\r\ndistinctly recognizable, but soldered to each other and only separated\r\nby a slight furrow; they form by their union a very acute knee or bend.\r\nThe femur is movable on the pad-like coxa, the tibia continues without\r\nprecise limits with the extremity concealed in the larval legs. The\r\nthree divisions of the latter do not appear to have any relation with\r\nthe live joints of the perfect state. Under the microscope the rudiment\r\nappears very strongly plaited at the level of the tarsus, much less so\r\nin the other regions. A large trachea penetrates into the femur with\r\nsome capillaries; reaching the knee it bends into the tibia at a sharp\r\ncurve, but does not become truly sinuous in approaching the extremity.\r\nIt is then the tarsus especially which is susceptible of elongation; it\r\nmay, on being withdrawn, give rise to the illusion that the whole organ\r\nis disengaged from the larval leg.\r\n\r\n“This disposition is, we believe, not known. It gives the key to the\r\nexperiments of Réaumur and of Newport.\r\n\r\n“Even when we cut off the limb of the caterpillar at its base, we only\r\nremove the tarsus of the imago; the femur and the tibia remain intact.\r\nFrom an evident homology Réaumur has erroneously concluded that there is\r\nan identity. His opinion, classical up to this day, that the limb of the\r\nbutterfly is entirely contained in the leg of the caterpillar, has been\r\nfound to be inexact and should be abandoned.”\r\n\r\n=Embryonic cells and the phagocytes.=—Up to the last larval stage the\r\nlegs do not offer, says Gonin, any vestige of an imaginal germ, but they\r\ncontain a great number of embryonic cells (Fig. 145, _ec_). They are\r\nalmost always collected around a nerve or trachea; sometimes they are\r\nindependent, and sometimes retained in the peritoneal sheath, seeming to\r\narise by proliferation from this sheath. Some thus contribute to the\r\nlengthening of the tracheal branches or nerves, and the others, becoming\r\ndetached, form leucocytes or phagocytes. They are very numerous in the\r\nlegs, at the beginning of the 4th stage, but are disseminated some days\r\nlater throughout the whole cavity of the body. At the time of histolysis\r\nthey attack the larval tissues and increase in volume at their expense;\r\nin return they serve for the nutrition of the imaginal parts and\r\nexercise no destructive action on them. Van Rees agrees with Kowalevsky\r\nin comparing these attacks of the embryonic cells, sometimes victorious\r\nand sometimes impotent, to the war which the leucocytes wage against\r\nboth the attenuated and the virulent bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the femur and of the tibia, transformation of the\r\ntarsus.=—Capillary tracheæ appear in the leg at the same time as in the\r\nwing. They arise from the end of a tracheal trunk near the base of the\r\nlimb on the dorsal and convex side. After the 3d moult the hypodermis\r\nthickens near this place; in a few days a pad is formed there and then a\r\nlarge imaginal bud with a circular invagination. These buds were noticed\r\nby Lyonet, who supposed them to be “les principes des jambes de la\r\nphalène.” Nerves and a tracheal branch penetrate into the femoro-tibial\r\nbud and form a small bay or constriction which marks the point of\r\njunction of the femur with the tibia, and the body-cavity remains in\r\ndirect communication with the end of the limb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 608.—Feet of the Pieris butterfly withdrawing from those of the\r\n    larva.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 609.—Imaginal feet of Pieris uncovered with great care to\r\n    preserve the position which they had in the larva: _ta_, tarsus;\r\n    _t_, tibia; _g_, knee; _f_, femur; _h_, coxa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tarsus undergoes a series of changes; the surface is folded in a\r\nvery complicated way; at the level of each articulation, but only in the\r\ninternal and concave region of the leg, is developed a deep fold; on one\r\nside there is a hypodermic thickening, on the other a simple leaf of the\r\nenvelope, which afterwards joins at its base with the parietal\r\nhypodermis, and then two leaves are destroyed with the large cells of\r\nthe setæ. The internal part and end of the tarsus are then reconstituted\r\nwith the elimination of the débris, while the external and convex region\r\nundergoes direct regeneration.\r\n\r\nThe coxa and trochanter are derived from the base of the larval leg, and\r\nonly the 1st pair are well separated from the base of the thorax. One or\r\ntwo days before pupation the femoro-tibial bud, after having, until now,\r\npreserved its antero-posterior direction, is placed transversely as\r\nregards the larva, then becoming directed obliquely forward. This\r\nrotatory movement of the coxa may be attributed to the great extension\r\nof the fore wings, which push before them the two first pairs of legs.\r\nThe last pair in their turn are simply covered by the hind wings and are\r\nbut slightly displaced. This new position of the legs is that of the\r\nimago: the knee of the 1st pair is situated in front of the tarsus; that\r\nof the 2d a little outward; that of the 3d pair is directed backward.\r\n(Gonin.)\r\n\r\n=The antennæ.=—These appendages also have the same relation with those\r\nof the caterpillar as in the case of the legs, the larval appendages\r\nbeing only the point of departure of the imaginal growth. Weismann has\r\nobserved in Corethra how at the approach of each moult an invagination\r\nlike the finger of a glove allows the antenna to elongate from its base.\r\nThe process, says Gonin, is identical in the caterpillar of Pieris. At\r\nthe last moult the invagination is so pronounced that it is not effaced\r\nwith the renewal of the chitinous integument. Several days later it\r\nagain begins to grow larger. As the imaginal bud gradually sinks into\r\nthe cavity of the head, it presses back the hypodermic wall and thus\r\nforms an envelope around it. Its base, widely opened, gives admission to\r\nthe nerves, besides capillaries and sometimes a large trachea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 610.—Larva in same stage as Fig. 613; side view of head and\r\n    thorax: _a_, _a′_, wings, with the folds on the surface, and the\r\n    sinuous track of the tracheal bundles; _st I_, prothoracic stigma;\r\n    _p_, _p′_, ends of the legs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs soon as it reaches the posterior region of the head, the antenna in\r\nlengthening becomes folded and describes the great curves which led\r\nRéaumur to compare it to a ram’s horn (Fig. 613). The leaf of the\r\nenvelope thickens in the interior and all around the base of the organ.\r\nIts ultimate rôle is closely like that of the two other hypodermic\r\nformations. It is at the outset this layer of cells which in the larva\r\nsupports the ocelli. This layer, hidden on each side under the parietal\r\nregion, thickens and regenerates, forming a circular pad which becomes\r\nmore prominent and finally assumes the form of the compound eye of the\r\nimago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 611.—Head of the larva just before pupation: between the two\r\n    mandibles (_m_) is seen the relief of the tongue or maxillæ (_m′_);\r\n    _f_, spinneret; _l_, labrum; _a_, antenna.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 612.—Same stage as in Fig. 611, but after the removal of the\r\n    larval skin, and including the lateral scale: _A_, side, _B_, front,\r\n    view; _c_, “cimier” (the dotted line shows the position it takes in\r\n    the pupa); _a_, antenna; _o_, eye; _t_, tongue.—This and Figs.\r\n    608–611, after Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFinally, this layer gives rise to a conical prolongation (Fig. 612,\r\n_c_), which after exuviation appears as a tuft of long hairs, and is\r\ncalled by Gonin the crest (cimier, Fig. 612), which is characteristic of\r\nthe pupæ of Pieridæ. It is only differentiated towards the end of the\r\n4th larval stage in a median depression of the vertex. It is an imaginal\r\nbud in the most general sense of the word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 613.—Larva of _Pieris brassicæ_ stripped of its skin some minutes\r\n    before pupation: the antennæ (_a_) have been displaced, and the\r\n    tongue cut off, to show the palpi (_p_); _c_, cimier: _o_, eye; _m_,\r\n    vestige of a mandible; _t_, insertion of the tongue (see Fig. 612);\r\n    _aa_, fore, _ap_, hind, wings; _g_, knee of a foot of the 3d pair.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn each side the base of the antenna comes in contact with the germ of\r\nthe crest. The envelopes approach each other, and their thickened part\r\nconstitutes with the ocular disks a new cephalic wall. The head of the\r\nbutterfly thus marked off is triangular; all the larval parts remaining\r\nout of this area then disappear. The muscles and the nerves are resorbed\r\nby histolysis, then the external part of the imaginal envelopes and the\r\nold parietal hypodermis, reduced very thin and degenerated, is detached\r\nin shreds. The antenna becomes external throughout its whole extent. The\r\ntransformation is in this case, then, almost as complete as in the\r\nthorax of Diptera or Hymenoptera. It is necessitated by the change of\r\nform and of volume of the head. The region of the ocelli persists\r\nunchanged almost alone from the larva to the imago also. The limit is\r\nnot well marked between the portion which is the replacement or direct\r\nrenovation of the epithelium.\r\n\r\n=Maxilla and labial palpi.=—The development of the tongue (1st maxillæ)\r\nis so like that of the antennæ that it scarcely needs description.\r\nBeginning at the last moult, the hypodermic contents of the maxillæ is\r\nwithdrawn in the cephalic cavity under the form of a hollow bud whose\r\nbase is turned inward. The invagination remains less distinct than in\r\nthe antennæ; it does not even reach to the anterior part of the\r\nœsophagus. The two symmetrical halves of the tongue approach each other\r\nand are thrice folded. When the caterpillar stops feeding, they each\r\ncurve in in the form of an S, remaining lodged under the floor of the\r\nmouth (Fig. 613, _t_).\r\n\r\nUnderneath are to be seen two other buds, which by an identical process\r\nbecome the labial palpi (Figs. 614, 615, _p_).\r\n\r\nAt the anterior part of the head, where the organs are very close\r\ntogether, the envelopes form several folds without any further use (Fig.\r\n615, _r_). The two leaves then fuse together and decay as at the surface\r\nof the tarsus.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the mandibles and the labrum, there is only a cellular\r\nthickening without any invagination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 614.—Section through the anterior region of the head of Pieris\r\n    larva, four days after the 3d moult: _o_, œsophagus; _m_, _m_, 1st\r\n    maxillæ containing the two imaginal buds of the tongue; _p_, _p_,\r\n    labial palpi; _Tr_, trachea.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 615.—Section through the same place as in Fig. 614, 10 days after\r\n    the 3d moult, the imaginal appendages having grown in size: _r_,\r\n    _r_, caducous folds of the old hypodermis and of the envelopes.\r\n    Other letters as in Fig. 614.—This and Figs. 613–614, after Gonin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Process of pupation.=—Notwithstanding the great number of persons who\r\nhave reared Lepidoptera, close and patient observations as to the exact\r\ndetails are still needed. Gonin, who has made the closest observations\r\non Pieris, pertinently asks why the antennæ, which are appendages of the\r\nhead, are visible in the abdominal region, and why the tongue (maxillæ)\r\nis extended between the legs as far as the 3d abdominal segment. To\r\nanswer these questions he made a series of experiments. Selecting some\r\ncaterpillars which were about to pupate, he produced an artificial\r\nmetamorphosis by removing the cuticula in small bits. Exposing the\r\nappendages in this way, they preserved the position which they are seen\r\nto take during growth. Each wing appeared within the limits of the\r\nsegment from which it grew out (Fig. 610), not extending beyond, as it\r\ndoes in the normal pupa, so that Réaumur was wrong in saying that “the\r\nwings are here gathered on each side into a kind of band, which is large\r\nenough to lie in the cavity which is between the 1st and 2d segment.”\r\n(8^e Mém., p. 359.)\r\n\r\nAll these parts are coated with a viscous fluid secreted by special\r\nglands, which hardens after pupation upon exposure to the air. So long\r\nas the parts are soft, they can easily be displaced. Gonin drew one of\r\nthe antennæ like a collar around the head, and one half of the tongue\r\nupon the outer side of the wing.\r\n\r\n“When pupation is normal, the integument splits open on the back of the\r\nthorax, and the pupa draws itself from before backwards. Owing to the\r\nfeeble adherence which the chitinous secretion gives it, it draws along\r\nwith it the underlying organs. The legs, antennæ, the two halves of the\r\ntongue (maxillæ) retained by their end, each in a small chitinous case,\r\ncan only disengage themselves from it when in elongating they have\r\nacquired a sufficient tension. The curves straighten out and the folds\r\nunbend. The chitinous mask of the head in withdrawing from the larval\r\nskin follows the ventral line; the tongue and labial palpi free\r\nthemselves from its median part; the antennæ disengage themselves from\r\nthe two lateral scales. Between these different appendages a space is\r\nleft on the surface of the head for the eyes, and on the thorax for the\r\nlegs. These are not completely extended on account of the lack of\r\nfreedom of the femoro-tibial articulation; the femur preserves its\r\ndirection from behind forwards, and the knee in the two first pairs\r\nremains at the same height. The wings overlie them and cover the under\r\nside of the two basal abdominal segments; their surfaces in becoming\r\nunited increase much in size.”\r\n\r\nAs the chitinous frame of each spiracle gradually detaches itself, we\r\nsee a tuft of tracheæ passing out of the orifice. It is at this moment\r\nthat the provisional tracheal system is cast off, and it is easy to see\r\nthat the process is facilitated by the simultaneous elongation of all\r\nthe appendages. The permanent tracheæ can follow this elongation because\r\nthey are sinuous, and need only to straighten their curves. It is,\r\nhowever, not the same with the tracheoles, as we have seen in the case\r\nof the wings (p. 133), and their extension or stretching is thus\r\nexplained by a very simple mechanism.\r\n\r\n  “The position which the organs assume in the chrysalis is not due to\r\n  chance, everything is determined in advance, and the microscope\r\n  shows us that the structure of the hypodermis is specially modified\r\n  in all the parts which remain external. It is a fact well known to\r\n  those who rear Lepidoptera that if this normal arrangement is\r\n  disturbed there are few chances that the perfect insect will\r\n  survive. A leg lifted up, or an antenna displaced, leaves a surface\r\n  illy protected against external influences. Almost always this\r\n  accident causes a drying of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n  “Several interesting experiments may be cited as bearing on this\r\n  subject. If during transformation the chitinous mask of the head is\r\n  separated from the integument beneath, it is arrested half-way in\r\n  its development, and the antennæ and tongue are not fully extended.\r\n  When the case or skin of the caterpillar is drawn, not from before\r\n  backward, but in the opposite direction, all the appendages of the\r\n  thorax are placed perpendicularly to the body. Dewitz and Künckel\r\n  d’Herculais, in stating that the skin of the caterpillar splits open\r\n  along its whole length, show that they were ignorant of the\r\n  mechanism; for it is precisely because the chitinous larval skin\r\n  splits open only in front that it preserves sufficient adherence to\r\n  the organs beneath to draw them after it in the direction of the\r\n  abdomen.\r\n\r\n  “To only read modern authors, one would suppose that the mechanism\r\n  of pupation had remained hitherto unknown. In reality, it did not\r\n  escape the notice of Swammerdam or of Réaumur, both of whom have\r\n  described it with care. The first attached too much importance to\r\n  the flow of blood, the action of which would be rather to push the\r\n  organs out than to extend them over the surface of the thorax; the\r\n  second insists on the movements of the insect. This factor, very\r\n  admissible in caterpillars, ‘whose under side is situated on a\r\n  horizontal plane’ (iii, 9^e Mémoire, p. 395), cannot be invoked for\r\n  those which suspend themselves by the tail, as in the genus\r\n  Vanessa.” (Gonin.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _b._ The Hymenoptera\r\n\r\nIn the Hymenoptera, Ratzeburg was the first to figure and describe the\r\nnumerous intermediate stages between the larva and pupa, his subjects\r\nbeing the ants, Cynips, and Cryptus, which pass through five stadia\r\nbefore assuming the final pupal shape.\r\n\r\nIn the bees, as we have observed in the larvæ of Bombus (Proc. Bost.\r\nSoc. Nat. Hist., 1866), after hardening a series in alcohol of young in\r\ndifferent stages of development, it will be found difficult to draw the\r\nline between the different stages since they shade insensibly into each\r\nother, those represented in Fig. 616 being selected stages. The head of\r\nthe incipient semipupa distends the prothoracic segment of the larva\r\nwhose head is pushed forward and the thoracic segments are much\r\nelongated, while the appendages and wings are well developed, and have\r\nassumed the shape of those of the pupa. Development both in the head and\r\nthorax begins in the most important central parts, and proceeds outwards\r\nto the periphery. During this period the “median segment,” or 1st\r\nabdominal, has begun to pass forward and to form a part of the thorax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 616.—Transformation of the bumblebee, Bombus, showing the\r\n    transfer of the 1st abdominal larval segment (_c_) to the thorax,\r\n    forming the propodeum of the pupa (_D_) and imago: _n_, spiracle of\r\n    the propodeum. _A_, larva; _a_, head; _b_, 1st thoracic, _c_, 1st\r\n    abdominal, segment. _B_, semipupa; _g_, antenna; _h_, maxillæ; _i_,\r\n    1st, _j_, 2d leg; _k_, mesoscutum. _l_, mesoscutellum; _m_,\r\n    metathorax; _d_, urite (sternite of abdomen); _e_, pleurite; _f_,\r\n    tergite; _o_, ovipositor; _r_, lingua; _q_, maxilla.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn what may be termed the 3d stage (Fig. 616, _C_), though the\r\ndistinction is a very arbitrary one, the change is accompanied by a\r\nmoulting of the skin, and a great advance has been made towards assuming\r\nthe pupal form. The abdomen is very distinctly separated from the\r\nthorax, the propodeum being closely united with the thorax, and the head\r\nand thorax taken together are nearly as large as the abdomen, the latter\r\nnow being shorter and perceptibly changed in form, more like that of the\r\ncompleted pupa, while there are other most important changes in the\r\nelaboration of the parts of the thorax, particularly the tergites, and\r\nof the head and its appendages. Meanwhile the ovipositor has been\r\ncompleted and nearly withdrawn within the end of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe next to study the transformations of the Hymenoptera was Ganin, who\r\ndiscovered the early remarkable pre-eruciform larvæ, as we may call\r\nthem, of certain egg-parasites (Proctotrypidæ). He discovered the\r\nimaginal buds of the wings in the third larva of Polynema (Fig. 185),\r\nbut his observations, and those of Ayers, need not detain us here, as\r\nthey have little to do with the subject of the normal metamorphosis of\r\nthe Hymenoptera, and will be discussed under the subject of\r\nHypermetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nTo Bugnion we owe the first detailed account of the internal changes in\r\nthe Hymenoptera, his observations being made on a chalcid parasite,\r\n_Encyrtus fuscicollis_, a parasite of Hyponomeuta. The apodous larva\r\n(Fig. 618) moults but once, the next ecdysis being at the time of\r\npupation. It passes through a semipupal stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 617.—Encyrtus larva: 1, 2, 3, ganglia in front of the brain; _m_,\r\n    mouth; _s. gl_, silk-gland; _br_, brain; _n_, nervous cord; _w_, bud\r\n    of fore, _w′_, bud of hind, wing.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBugnion observed in the larva of Encyrtus three pairs of lower thoracic\r\nor pedal imaginal buds, two pairs of upper or alary buds, a pair of\r\nocular or oculo-cephalic buds destined to build up all the posterior\r\npart of the head, a pair of antennal buds, and three pairs of buds of\r\nthe genital armature (ovipositor). He also detected the rudiments of the\r\nbuccal appendages under the form of six small buds (Fig. 619), which do\r\nnot invaginate, and are not surrounded by a semicircular pad. Also in\r\nthe abdomen, behind each pair of stigmata, there is a group of\r\nhypodermic cells (Fig. 617), which, without doubt, correspond to the\r\nwing-buds, but are not differentiated into a central bud and its pad,\r\nand does not merit the name of imaginal bud. In fact, except the\r\neye-buds, which are unlike the others, he only observed the imaginal\r\nbuds of the legs, wings, and ovipositor. The antennal buds are, like\r\nthose of the buccal appendages, without an annular zone.\r\n\r\nThe pedal buds were detected in the middle of larval life. They each\r\nform a central bud surrounded by a circular thickening. They gradually\r\nelongate and become tongue-like and somewhat bent; soon a linear opening\r\nor slit appears, forming the mouth of a cavity which communicates with\r\nthat of the body, allowing the passage into them of the tracheæ,\r\nmuscles, and nerves, and afterwards of the blood. Finally, the buds grow\r\nlonger and slenderer, are bent several times, and show traces of the\r\narticulations; and soon under the old larval skin, now beginning to rise\r\nin anticipation of the moulting, we see the coxa, femur, tibia, and\r\ntarsus of the perfect insect, the tarsal joints not yet being indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 618.—Older Encyrtus larva, lateral view, showing the buds of the\r\n    antennæ (_ant_), legs, and wings (_w_, _w′_): _oe_, œsophagus;\r\n    _q^1_, _q^2_, _q^3_, buds of the genital armature; _o_, rudiment of\r\n    the sexual gland (ovary or testis); _ur.t_, urinary tube; _st_,\r\n    stomach; _i_, intestine (rectum); _n_, ventral nervous cord; _r_,\r\n    rectum; _sp^1_-_sp^9_, spiracles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 619.—A still older larva, ready to transform. The imaginal buds\r\n    of the antennæ (_f_), eyes, wings (_a^1_, _a^2_), and legs have\r\n    become elongated: _ch_, chitinous arch; _b_, mouth; _o_, eye-bud;\r\n    _g_, brain; _e_, stomach; _x_, rudiment of the sexual glands (either\r\n    the ovary or testis).—This and Figs. 617 and 618, after Bugnion.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wing-buds (_a^1_, _a^2_) appear at the same time as those of the\r\nlegs, as racket-shaped masses of small cells situated directly behind\r\nthe 1st and 2d pair of stigmata, in contact with the tissue ensheathed\r\nby the corresponding tracheal vesicle (Fig. 618). Afterwards they have\r\nexactly the form of those of the Lepidoptera (Fig. 619).\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of the hypodermis is not limited to the thorax, but\r\ntakes place at corresponding points in the first seven abdominal\r\nsegments. These abdominal agglomerations of cells do not give rise to\r\ntrue buds, but serve simply to reconstitute the hypodermis of the\r\nabdominal segments at the time of metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n=Ocular or oculo-cephalic buds.=—The eye of insects, as is well known,\r\nis a modification of a portion of the integument, the visual cells being\r\ndirectly derived from the hypodermis, the cornea being a cuticular\r\nproduct of this last, like chitinous formations in general.\r\n\r\nThe ocular buds appear towards the end of larval life as a simple mass\r\nof hypodermic cells, and form a compact layer on the dorsolateral face\r\nof the prothoracic segment, and clothe the cephalic ganglion or brain\r\nlike a skull-cap. The central portion only is destined to form the eye,\r\nwhile the peripheral pad, continuing to thicken, gives rise to a\r\nvoluminous and rounded mass, which meets on the median line that of the\r\nopposite side, and forms the integument of all the posterior part of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBugnion also observed on the median line a group of small hypodermic\r\ncells which he regarded as the rudiment of the anterior ocellus, but he\r\ndid not detect those of the posterior ocelli.\r\n\r\n=The antennal buds.=—These appear at an early date under the cuticle of\r\nthe head, as two distinct rounded cellular masses, with a central\r\ncavity, but no annular zone (Fig. 619, _f_). Each one grows longer in a\r\ntransverse sense, and its summit, extended from the outer side, curves\r\ndownward. It now forms a hollow tube folded at the end, and terminated\r\nby a disk whose centre is perforated (Fig. 619, _f_). Afterwards, when\r\nthe larva is ready to transform, it grows longer, becomes folded on\r\nitself in its cavity, and, passing beyond on each side the limits of the\r\nlarval head, encroaches on the prothoracic segment.\r\n\r\n=The buds of the buccal appendages.=—Towards the end of the larval\r\nperiod, the buds of the mouth-parts appear as small digitiform\r\nprojections, situated on each side and below the mouth. Formed of small\r\nepithelial cells pressed against each other, they are all directed\r\nanteriorly, and possess no furrow or pad.\r\n\r\nThe 2d maxillæ (labium) is formed of two separate parts. The imaginal\r\nbuds of the lower lip appear on each side of the median line, with a\r\nfissure indicating the differentiation of the palpus. On each side are\r\nto be seen the 1st maxillary buds, bearing each a rudimentary palpus,\r\nand, farther in front, the buds of the mandibles.\r\n\r\n=The buds of the ovipositor.=—The six stylets of the ovipositor arise\r\nfrom six small imaginal buds which become visible in the second half of\r\nthe larval period, on each side of the median line, on the lower face of\r\nthe three last segments (Fig. 620, _q^1_, _q^2_, _q^3_). The bud is\r\ndifferentiated into a central discoidal bud, a furrow, and a marginal,\r\nrather thick swelling or pad. Afterwards, these buds elongate and form\r\nsmall papilliform projections directed backwards (Fig. 621); but only\r\nduring the pupal period do they, as already observed in Bombus, approach\r\neach other and assume their definite shape as an ovipositor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 620.—End of larva of Encyrtus of 2d stage, showing the three\r\n    pairs of imaginal buds of the ovipositor _q^1_, _q^2_, _q^3_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 621.—The same in an older larva ready to transform: _i_,\r\n    intestine; _x_, genital gland; _a_, anus.—After Bugnion.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFinally, Bugnion states that while metamorphosis in the Hymenoptera is\r\nless highly modified than in the Muscidæ, it is more marked than in the\r\nColeoptera and Lepidoptera. In these orders the pupa moves the abdomen,\r\nbut in Hymenoptera it is absolutely immovable throughout pupal life, as\r\nlong as the integument is soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGO IN THE DIPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flies, particularly the Muscidæ and their allies (Brachycera), are\r\nthe most highly modified of insects, their larvæ having undergone the\r\ngreatest amount of reduction and loss of limbs, this atrophy involving\r\neven most of the head. The following account has been prepared in part\r\nfrom the works of Weismann, Ganin, Miall, and Pratt, but mostly from the\r\nexcellent general summarized account given by Korschelt and Heider.\r\n\r\nIn the holometabolic orders of insects, with their resting pupal stage,\r\nduring which no food is taken, the entire activity of life seems to be\r\nturned to deep-seated and complicated internal developmental processes.\r\nThese inner changes involve an almost complete destruction of many\r\norgans of the larva, and their renewal from certain germs (the imaginal\r\nbuds) already present in the larva, as will be seen in the highly\r\nmodified Muscidæ. Only a few larval organs become directly transferred\r\ninto the body of the pupa and imago. Such are the rudiments of the\r\ngenital system. The heart also, and the central portion of the nervous\r\nsystem, suffer only slight and unimportant, almost trivial, internal\r\nchanges. On the other hand, most of the other organs of the larva become\r\ncompletely destroyed: the hypodermis, most of the muscles, the entire\r\ndigestive canal with the salivary glands; while their cells, under the\r\ninfluence of the blood corpuscles (leucocytes), which here act as\r\nphagocytes, fall into pieces, which are taken up by them and become\r\ndigested. Simultaneously with this destructive, histolytic process, the\r\nnew formation of the organs by the imaginal buds, already indicated in\r\nthe embryo, is accomplished in such a way that the continuity of the\r\norgans in most cases remains unimpaired. This process of transformation\r\ncan only be understood by considering that of the embryonal germs of the\r\norgans, (1) only a part is destined for the use of the larva in growth,\r\nand for the performance of certain functions which exhaust themselves\r\nduring larval life, so that it is no more capable of farther\r\ntransformation, and finally becomes destroyed; while (2) a second part\r\nof the embryonal germs or rudiments persists first in an undeveloped\r\ncondition, as imaginal buds, in order to undertake during the pupa stage\r\nthe regeneration of the organs.\r\n\r\n  Though Swammerdam knew that the rudiments of the wings were already\r\n  present under the skin of the larvæ, we are indebted, for our\r\n  present knowledge, to the thorough and profound investigations of\r\n  Weismann on the metamorphosis of the Diptera, and also to the\r\n  researches of Ganin and others who have worked on the pupæ of\r\n  Muscidæ, in which the development is most complicated and modified.\r\n  In the more generalized and primitive Diptera, such as Corethra, the\r\n  processes of formation of the pupa and imago are much simpler than\r\n  in the muscids and Pupipara. These processes are still simpler in\r\n  the Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, and for this reason we have given a\r\n  summary of what has been done on these organs by Newport, Dewitz,\r\n  and especially by Bugnion.\r\n\r\n  Our knowledge of this subject is still very imperfect, only the more\r\n  salient points having been worked out, and, as Korschelt and Heider\r\n  state, there is still lacking certain proof as to how far the\r\n  relations of the internal changes known to exist in the Muscidæ also\r\n  apply to other orders of insects, though it must be considered that\r\n  in the pupa of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, perhaps also the\r\n  Coleoptera, and we would add in the Neuroptera as well as the male\r\n  Coccidæ, very similar metamorphic processes take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _a._ Development of the outer body-form\r\n\r\nThe form of the imago is completely marked out in the pupa, so that the\r\ntransition from the pupa to the imago is comparatively slight and only\r\ndepends on the modification and development of the parts already\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 622.—Anterior part of young larva of _Simulium sericea_, showing\r\n    the thoracic imaginal buds: _p_, prothoracic bud (only one not\r\n    embryonic); _w_, _w′_, fore and hind wing-buds; _l_, _l′_, _l″_,\r\n    leg-buds; _n_, nervous system; _br_, brain; _e_, eye; _sd_, salivary\r\n    duct; _p_, prothoracic foot.—After Weismann.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn most cases the modification in question consists of the changes\r\noccurring during the passage from the larval form to the imago, the\r\nreformation of parts already present being most marked, while the new\r\nrudiments only participate in a limited way in the process. Thus, for\r\nexample, the head of the caterpillar together with the antennæ and\r\nmouth-parts, also the thoracic limbs, pass directly and unchanged from\r\nthe larva into the pupa. The compound eyes and the wings are, however,\r\nnew formations, the latter arising from imaginal buds. The same is the\r\ncase with many other Heterometabola, where the passage of the larva into\r\nthe pupa in general is due to a transformation of parts already present.\r\nThe changes in the brain, the fusion of certain ganglia of the ventral\r\nnervous cord, the changes in the abdomen, involving the reduction in the\r\nnumber of segments and the remodelling of the end of the body, and the\r\nformation of the ovipositor or sting, and in the higher Hymenoptera the\r\ntransfer of the 1st abdominal segment to the thorax, and the origin of\r\nthe genital armature,—all these should here be taken into account.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that in every case where the larvæ are footless,\r\nas in Diptera, all the Hymenoptera except the phytophagous ones and\r\ncertain coleopterous larvæ, the limbs of the imago stage are, in the\r\nearliest stages, indicated as new structures in the form of imaginal\r\nbuds.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the imago in Corethra.=—Corethra may serve as an example\r\nof such a relatively simple metamorphosis. Its larva belongs to the\r\ngroup of eucephalous dipterous larvæ. The head of the perfect insect is\r\nalready indicated in the larva, and its parts, with certain\r\nmodifications, pass directly into the pupa. The compound eyes, and this\r\nis a rare exception among the Holometabola, are present in the larva. On\r\nthe other hand, the thoracic legs, the wings, and halteres are developed\r\nout of new rudiments which are present in the last larval stage, before\r\npupation. Each thoracic segment has four of them, two ventral and two\r\ndorsal (Fig. 622); the ventral buds becoming the legs. Of the dorsal\r\npairs, that of the mesothorax develops into wings, that of the\r\nmetathorax into halteres, while from the corresponding rudiments of the\r\nprothorax in Corethra arise the stigma-bearing dorsal or respiratory\r\nprocesses of the pupa, and in Simulium a tuft of tracheal gills (Fig.\r\n623, _ra_; see also Fig. 582).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 623.—Late larva of Simulium, showing the rudiments of the pupal\r\n    structures within the larval skin: _l^1_, _l^2_, _l^3_, fore,\r\n    middle, and hind legs of the fly; _ra_, respiratory appendages of\r\n    pupa; _w_, wing of fly; _h_, halter of fly.—After Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 624.—Imaginal buds in larva of Corethra (diagrammatic\r\n    cross-section of thorax): invaginations (_fe_ and _be_) of the\r\n    larval hypodermis (_lhy_) in whose bases the rudiments of wings\r\n    (_fa_) and legs (ba) arise; _lh_, chitinous integument of the\r\n    larva.—After Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese imaginal buds may be regarded as evaginations of the outer surface\r\nof the body. The only difference is that the buds of the appendages as a\r\nwhole seem sunken below the level of the surface of the body, being\r\nsituated at the bottom of an evagination, as in the buds of the head and\r\ntrunk in the Pilidium larva of nemertean worms, and in the rudiments of\r\nthe lower surface of the body of Echinus present in the pluteus larva.\r\n\r\nThe lumen of the invagination in which the appendages of Corethra (and\r\nother Holometabola) are situated is called by Van Rees the _peripodal\r\ncavity_, and the external sheath bordering it, which is naturally\r\ncontinuous with the hypodermis of the body, the _peripodal membrane_\r\n(Fig. 636, _p_).\r\n\r\n  We must adopt the view that the rudiments of the appendages\r\n  (imaginal buds) are from the first divided into ectodermal and\r\n  mesodermal portions, which are derived from the corresponding\r\n  germ-layers of the larva. The ectoderm of the rudiments of the\r\n  appendages is continuous with the peripodal membrane, and through it\r\n  with the hypodermis. Weismann was inclined to derive the organs\r\n  (tracheæ, muscles, etc.) developing within the germs of the\r\n  appendages from a hypertrophy of the neurilemma of a nerve passing\r\n  down from within into the imaginal bud, and held that nerves and\r\n  tracheal branches soon after passed into the inner surface of the\r\n  imaginal bud. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\nWhen the imaginal buds of the appendages enlarge, then the peripodal\r\nmembranes become correspondingly distended, and the limbs within assume\r\na more or less crumpled position, and in Corethra are spirally twisted,\r\nwhile the rudiments of the wings are folded. The completion of the\r\nrudimentary limbs is accomplished simply by their passing out of the\r\ninvagination in which they originated. The limbs thus gradually become\r\nfree, the peripodal membrane is seen to reach the level of the rest of\r\nthe hypodermis and become a part of it, and the base of the extremity is\r\nno longer situated in a cavity.\r\n\r\nThe internal organs of Corethra undergo but to a slight degree the\r\ndestruction (histolysis) which is so thoroughgoing in the Muscidæ.\r\nKowalevsky states that in the mid-intestine of Corethra a histolysis of\r\nthe larval and reconstruction of the imaginal epithelium goes on in the\r\nsame way as has been described in Musca. Most of the larval organs pass\r\nwithout histolytic changes directly over into those of the pupal and\r\nimaginal stages; the muscles in general are also unchanged, but those of\r\nthe appendages and wings are made over anew. The last arise, according\r\nto Weismann, in the last larval stage from strings of cells which are\r\nalready present in the embryo.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how insignificant the internal transformations are\r\nduring the metamorphosis of the Tipulidæ, of which Corethra serves as an\r\nexample, we can scarcely doubt that we here have before us conditions\r\nwhich illustrate the passage between an incomplete and a complete\r\nmetamorphosis. Thus, among other things, should be mentioned the short\r\nduration of the pupa stage and the activity of the pupa, as also the\r\nearly appearance of the germs of the compound eyes, a character which\r\nCorethra has in common with the Hemimetabola. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n=Formation of the imago in Culex.=—In respect to the formation of the\r\nimaginal head, Culex is still more primitive than Corethra. Miall and\r\nHammond find from Hurst’s partly unpublished descriptions and\r\npreparations that there are no deep invaginations for the compound eyes\r\nor antennæ of the imago.\r\n\r\n  “The compound eye forms beneath the larval eye-spots, and is at\r\n  first relatively simple and composed of few facets. The number\r\n  increases by the gradual formation of partial and marginal\r\n  invaginations, each of which forms a new element. The imaginal\r\n  antenna grows to a much greater length than that of the larval\r\n  antenna, and its base is accordingly telescoped into the head, while\r\n  the shaft becomes irregularly folded.[115] Culex, though more\r\n  modified than Chironomus in many respects, _e.g._ in the\r\n  mouth-parts, is relatively primitive with respect to the formation\r\n  of the imaginal head, and shows a mode of development of the eye and\r\n  antenna which we may suppose to have characterized a remote and\r\n  comparatively unspecialized progenitor of Chironomus.”\r\n\r\n=Formation of the imago in Chironomus.=—The development of the head of\r\nthe imago of _Chironomus dorsalis_ has been discussed by Miall and\r\nHammond. The invaginations which give rise to the head of the fly could\r\nnot be discovered even in a rudimentary state until after the last\r\nlarval moult.\r\n\r\n  “Weismann has given reasons for supposing that invaginated imaginal\r\n  rudiments could not come into existence before the last larval moult\r\n  in an insect whose life-history resembles that of Corethra or\r\n  Chironomus. If the epidermis were invaginated in any stage before\r\n  the ante-pupal one, the new cuticle, moulded closely upon the\r\n  epidermis, would become invaginated also, and would appear at the\r\n  next moult with projecting appendages like those of a pupa or imago.\r\n  This is actually the way in which the wings are developed in some\r\n  larval insects with incomplete metamorphosis. In Muscidæ the\r\n  invaginations for the head of the imago have been traced back to the\r\n  embryo within the egg,[116] but the almost total subsequent\r\n  separation of the disks from the epidermis renders their development\r\n  independent of the growth of the larval cuticle and of the moults\r\n  that probably take place therein.”\r\n\r\nThe pupal and imaginal cuticles do not follow at all closely the larval\r\nskin, but, says Miall, become at particular places folded far into the\r\ninterior. “The folds which give rise to the head of the fly are two in\r\nnumber and paired. They begin at the larval antenna on each side of the\r\nhead, and gradually extend further and further backwards. The object of\r\nthe folds is to provide an extended surface which can be moulded,\r\nwithout pressure from surrounding objects, into the form of the future\r\nhead. On one part of each fold the facets of the large compound eyes are\r\ndeveloped; another part gives rise to the future antenna, a large and\r\nelaborate organ, which springs from the bottom of the fold, and whose\r\ntip just enters the very short antenna of the larva. The folds for the\r\nhead ultimately become so large that the larval head cannot contain\r\nthem, and they extend far into the prothorax. Here a difficulty occurs.\r\nIf the generating cuticle of the prothorax were also to be folded\r\ninwards, the future prothorax would take a corresponding shape. But the\r\nprothorax of the fly has a form dictated to it by the limbs which it\r\nbears and by the muscles to which it gives attachment. These call for a\r\ngreat reduction in its length, and a peculiar shape, which it is not\r\nhere necessary to describe. It will be enough to realize that the\r\nepidermis of the future prothorax cannot be sacrificed to the folds\r\nwhich are to give rise to the head of the fly. All interference between\r\nthe two developing structures is obviated by the provision of a\r\ntransverse fold, which pushes into the prothorax from the neck, and\r\nforms a sort of internal pocket. The floor of the pocket forms two\r\nlongitudinal folds, which prolong the folds originating in the larval\r\nhead. The roof of the pocket shrinks up and forms the connection between\r\nthe head and thorax of the fly. Ultimately the head-part is drawn out,\r\nleaving the prothoracic structures unaffected.”[117]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 625.—Process of formation of the parts of the head of the fly in\r\n    the larva of Chironomus (male): _A_, the new epidermis thrown into\r\n    complicated folds which have been cut away in places to show the\r\n    parts within. _B_, the same parts in horizontal section; _lc_,\r\n    larval cuticle; _tf_, transverse fold; _tf′_, upper wall of the\r\n    same; _m_, cut edge of new epidermis; _ant_, larval antenna; _an_,\r\n    nerve to the same; _ant′_, antenna of fly; _lf_, longitudinal fold;\r\n    _o_, eye of fly; _on_, optic nerve; _an′_, root of antennary nerve;\r\n    _br_, brain; _œs_, œsophagus; _b_, bulb of antenna of fly; _s_, _s_,\r\n    _s′_, blood-spaces.—After Miall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe development of the head of the fly of Chironomus appears, as Miall\r\nand Hammond state, to be intermediate between the groups Adiscota and\r\nDiscota of Weismann; _i.e._ “between the types in which the parts of the\r\nhead of the fly are developed in close relation to those of the larva,\r\nand the types in which deep invaginations lead apparently to the\r\nformation of similar new parts far within the body, the seeming\r\nindependence of the new parts being intensified by thoroughgoing\r\nhistolysis,” and they suggest that possibly types may be discovered\r\nintermediate between Chironomus and Muscidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 626.—_A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, diagrams of transverse sections showing\r\n    the development of the wings, legs, and the imaginal hypodermis of\r\n    muscid flies from the imaginal buds of the larva during\r\n    metamorphosis: _lh_, chitinous integument of larva from which the\r\n    underlying hypodermis (_lhy_) has withdrawn; _iid_, imaginal buds of\r\n    wings, _iiv_, of legs; _is_, the cords connecting them with the\r\n    hypodermis; _fl_, wing-germs; _b_, leg-germs; _ihy_, imaginal\r\n    hypodermis spreading out in _D_ from the imaginal buds.

But in the Muscidæ, the buds\r\nare situated far within the interior of the body, the peripodal cavities\r\nappear closed, and the peripodal membrane stands in connection with the\r\nhypodermis merely by means of a delicate thread-like stalk. This\r\nconnecting cord, which was first detected by Dewitz, and whose\r\ninterpretation was entirely right, shows in its interior, as Van Rees\r\nproved, a narrow cavity.\r\n\r\nThough the earliest stages in the development of imaginal buds in the\r\nembryo of the Muscidæ are still unknown, yet we shall not go far astray\r\nif we refer them, like the imaginal buds of Corethra, to hypodermal\r\ninvaginations. We must, then, regard the stalk-like connection just\r\nmentioned as the long drawn-out neck of this invagination.\r\n\r\nIn general, the development of the appendages (Figs. 626, 627) goes on\r\nas described in Corethra. The rudiments of the legs enlarge and show at\r\nan early date the first traces of the later joints. They are so packed\r\nin the peripodal cavities that the single joints of the extremities\r\nappear as if pushed in “like the joints of a travelling cup.” (Van\r\nRees.) The evagination of the completely formed buds of the limbs, which\r\noccurs on the first day after the beginning of pupation, goes on in such\r\na way that the stalk of the imaginal bud (Figs. 626, _B_; 627, _B_)\r\nshortens, while its cavity widens so that the limbs finally, as in\r\nCorethra, pass out through the widely opened mouth of the peripodal\r\ninvagination, which at the same time gradually completely disappears.\r\nThe peripodal membrane is converted into a thickened part of the\r\nhypodermis in the region adjoining the base of the leg, and from this\r\nthickened hypodermal portion, the formation of the hypodermis of the\r\nentire imaginal thorax goes on, as the larval hypodermis is gradually\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 627.—Imaginal buds of muscid flies in process of development:\r\n    _A_, brain (_c_) and ventral ganglion (_v_) of a larva, 7 mm. long,\r\n    of _C. vomitoria_; _h_, head-rudiment; _rc_, portion of ventral\r\n    cord; _pd_, prothoracic rudiment; _vc_{3}_, third nerve; _md_,\r\n    mesothoracic rudiment. _B_, mesothoracic rudiment more advanced, in\r\n    a pupa, just formed, of _Sarcophaga carnaria_, showing the base of\r\n    the sternum and folds of the forming leg, the central part (_f_)\r\n    representing the foot. _C_, the rudimentary leg of the same more\r\n    advanced; _f_, femur; _t_, tibia; _f_{1}_, _f_{5}_, tarsal joints.\r\n    _D_, two buds from a larva, 20 mm. long, of Sarcophaga, attached to\r\n    tracheæ; _msw_, mesonotal and wing-germ; _mt_, metathoracic\r\n    rudiment. _E_, _r_, mesothoracic germ of a 7 mm. long larva attached\r\n    to a tracheal twig.—After Weismann and Graber, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  We must here settle the question as to the first origin of the\r\n  mesodermal portions of the rudiments of the appendages. We can\r\n  already distinguish in the imaginal buds of the fully grown muscid\r\n  larva a clear separation between an ectodermal and an inner\r\n  mesodermal part. Ganin derived the mesodermal part through a sort of\r\n  differentiation and separation of the innermost layer of the\r\n  ectodermal part, and Van Rees has, in general, confirmed this view.\r\n  Kowalevsky, on the other hand, is inclined to the view that the\r\n  mesodermal part of the imaginal bud is derived from the embryonal\r\n  cells of the mesoderm. He finds scattered throughout the mesoderm,\r\n  under the hypodermis of the larva, so-called wandering cells (Fig.\r\n  632, _A_, _w_), which are different in appearance from the\r\n  leucocytes and from the elements from which the formation of the\r\n  mesodermal parts of the imaginal rudiments proceed. Kowalevsky is\r\n  inclined to believe that there are in each segment rudiments of the\r\n  imaginal mesoderm, but which are so delicate and indifferent that we\r\n  cannot find them in the first stages of their origin. From these\r\n  mesodermal imaginal rudiments the above-mentioned wandering cells of\r\n  the mesoderm are derived, which afterwards come into connection with\r\n  the ectodermal portion of the imaginal buds.\r\n\r\nStill more complicated and difficult to understand is the development of\r\nthe head-section of muscids. We must remember that in muscid larvæ the\r\nhead-section exists in its most rudimentary form, being the result of\r\nextreme modification and degeneration. The small size of the head is\r\nalso due to the fact that it is more or less retracted within the\r\nthoracic region. Then, as shown by the researches of Weismann, in the\r\nlast embryonal stages, the forehead, mandibles, and the whole region of\r\nthe head around the mouth invaginate and form a sunken cavity (Fig. 628,\r\n_p_), in which the chitinous supports of the hooks characteristic of\r\nmuscid larvæ are soon developed. This sunken part of the head, at whose\r\ninner end is the œsophagus, is called by the not entirely appropriate\r\nname of “pharynx,” and it must at present be remembered that the hollow\r\nspace thus named is not a part of the digestive canal. It is an\r\ninvaginated section of the head, _and the formation of the head of the\r\nimago mainly depends on the evagination of this region_.\r\n\r\nThe first rudiments of the most important parts of the head (eyes,\r\nantennæ, and forehead), occur in the youngest larvæ as paired masses of\r\ncells which lie in the thorax next to the two halves of the brain (for\r\nthis reason called by Weismann “brain-appendages”), which are from their\r\nfirst origin connected with the pharynx, and may be regarded as the\r\nimaginal buds of the head. These appear very soon in later stages in the\r\nshape of elongated sacs widening at the hinder end (Fig. 628, _A_ and\r\n_B_, _h_), which from their origin are to be regarded as evaginations of\r\nthe pharynx. Very soon epithelial thickenings appear in the wall of this\r\nsac-shaped brain-appendage, in which the rudiments of the parts of the\r\nfuture head may be recognized.\r\n\r\nDisk-shaped thickenings in the hinder widened part of the\r\nbrain-appendage form the rudiments of the compound eyes, which therefore\r\nmay be called the eye-buds. On the basal surface of the eye-buds is\r\nsituated a nervous expansion which is connected by a nerve with the\r\nsupraœsophageal ganglion. This nerve becomes the optic nerve of the\r\nperfect animal, while the optic ganglion is clearly separated from the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nIn the anterior, more cylindrical or tube-like part of the\r\nbrain-appendage we find the “frontal buds” (_ss_), on which the antennal\r\nrudiments (_at_) soon bud out, in exactly the same way as the rudiments\r\nof the limbs arise from the imaginal buds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 628.—Diagrammatic representation of the position of the imaginal\r\n    buds in the larva (_A_) and pupa (_B_) of Musca (the wing rudiments\r\n    omitted): _as_, eye-buds; _at_, antennal germs; _b^1_-_b^3_, germs\r\n    of the legs; _bg_, central ganglionic cord: _g_, brain; _h_,\r\n    so-called frontal appendage (_Hirnanhang_): _m_, peripodal membrane;\r\n    _o_, opening of the frontal appendage into the pharynx; _oe_,\r\n    œsophagus; _p_, so-called “pharynx”; _r_, rudiment of the proboscis;\r\n    _ss_, frontal bud; _st_, stalk-like connection of the peripodal\r\n    membrane with the hypodermis; _I_-_III_, 1st, 2d, and 3d thoracic\r\n    segments.—Adapted from Van Rees, by Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOriginally (Fig. 628, _A_) the brain-appendages lie tolerably far behind\r\nin the thorax of the larva, so that they connect the hindermost part of\r\nthe wall of the pharynx with the foremost section of the brain, which\r\nthey surround in the form of a mushroom. Afterwards, however, subsequent\r\nto pupation, they move, together with the central nervous system,\r\nfarther forward (_B_), whereby they (if we have correctly understood the\r\ndescriptions of Weismann and Van Rees) laterally surround the pharynx\r\nwith their anterior end, which is somewhat ventrally bent. At the same\r\ntime, there becomes established a gradually widening communication (_B_,\r\n_o_) between the brain-appendage and the pharynx, which soon extends in\r\nthe form of a lateral pharyngeal fissure along the entire length of the\r\nbrain-appendage. As a result, the cavity of the brain-appendage and the\r\npharynx so completely unite that the two soon form a single sac, the\r\nhead-sac or vesicle (Fig. 6–9, _k_). The walls of this head-vesicle are\r\nthe later head-wall, the most important parts of which can now be\r\nrecognized (the antennæ, eyes, rudiments of the beak). It is now\r\nnecessary that the head-vesicle (Fig. 629, +, +) be, by the eversion of\r\nthe pharynx, turned outward in order that the head of the pupa may be\r\ncompleted. By this eversion of invaginated parts, the former\r\nmouth-opening of the pharynx becomes a neck-section (Fig. 629, +, +) by\r\nwhich head and thorax are now united. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 629.—Diagram of the changes to pupa of Musca before imago\r\n    appears; the wing-germs not drawn: _as_, eye-buds; _at_, antennal\r\n    germs; _b^1_-_b^3_, leg-germs; _bg_, ventral nerve-cord; _g_, brain;\r\n    _k_, head-vesicle (originating from the union of the pharynx with\r\n    the hypophysis, _Hirnanhängen_); _oe_, œsophagus; _r_, germ of the\r\n    proboscis; _ss_, germ of the forehead; _I_, _II_, _III_, 1st, 2d,\r\n    and 3d thoracic segments.—Based on Kowalevsky and Van Rees, with\r\n    changes, after Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The cause of the eversion of the head-vesicle, which Weismann\r\n  directly observed, appears to be due to an increase of the inner\r\n  pressure through a contraction of the hinder parts of the body. The\r\n  anterior end of the œsophagus now becomes turned down ventrally\r\n  corresponding to the conformation of the head of the imago.\r\n\r\n  It has been shown that the so-called pharynx is only an invaginated\r\n  part of the outer surface of the larval head. The brain-appendage\r\n  Korschelt and Heider consider to be the diverticulum of this\r\n  invagination, in which the single parts of the body lie in an\r\n  invaginated state. They may throughout be compared to the rudiments\r\n  of the thoracic limbs. All these imaginal buds have been traced back\r\n  to the invaginated parts of the outer surface of the body, _i.e._\r\n  the ectoderm.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the process of development of the head\r\nof the highly-modified Muscidæ is much more complex than in the more\r\nprimitive Diptera.\r\n\r\nIn their essay on the development of the head of the imago of\r\nChironomus, Miall and Hammond arrange the dipterous types thus far\r\nexamined, in the order of complexity of the invaginations which give\r\nrise to the head of the imago, in the following order:—\r\n\r\n     1. Culex. Relatively simple. Invaginations of the imaginal buds,\r\n       shallow. 2. Corethra, Simulium. } Intermediate. 3. Chironomus,\r\n       Ceratopogon. } 4. Muscidæ. Relatively complex. Invaginations\r\n       deep, and apparently, but not really, unconnected with the\r\n       epidermis.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _b._ Development of the internal organs of the imago\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 630.—Median longitudinal section through larva of blow-fly during\r\n    the process of histolysis: _an_, antenna; between _an_ and _w_,\r\n    rudiments of eye; _w_ wings; _h_, halteres; _b_{1}_-_b_{3}_, legs;\r\n    _f_, fat-body; _d_, middle of intestine; _n_, ganglia; _st_, stigma;\r\n    6, 7, 6th and 7th body-segments.—After Graber, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that most of the organs of muscid larvæ\r\n(and this applies to most Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and\r\nHymenoptera) are destroyed through the action of leucocytes, and that\r\ntheir reformation is accomplished by definite groups of embryonal cells,\r\nthe imaginal buds or folds. Destruction and rebuilding occur during the\r\npupa stage in such a way that in many cases while this process is going\r\non the continuity of the organs does not seem to be disturbed. These\r\ntransformations especially concern the hypodermis, the digestive canal,\r\nthe muscles, the fat-body, and the salivary glands.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the tracheal system is only partial, being in part\r\na simple process of regeneration through cell-division. Slighter changes\r\naffect the heart, the central nervous system, and the reproductive\r\nsystem (Fig. 630).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 631.—Diagram of the formation of the imaginal hypodermis on the\r\n    abdomen of Muscidæ: _hi_, imaginal buds of the hypodermis; _lh_,\r\n    larval hypodermis.—After Lang.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 632.—Section through the abdominal bud of the hypodermis of\r\n    Musca: _A_, of the larva; _B_ and _C_, of the pupa; _h_, larval\r\n    hypodermis; _h′_ separated portion of the same attacked by\r\n    phagocytes; _i_, imaginal bud; _k_, phagocytes with what are called\r\n    cell-wrecks or fragments (so-called granulated cells); _k′_,\r\n    phagocytes enclosing hypodermal nuclei; _m_, mesoderm-germ of the\r\n    imaginal bud; _w_, wandering cells.—After Kowalevsky, from Korschelt\r\n    and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The hypodermis.=—The hypodermis of the imago arises through an\r\nextension of the ectodermal part of the imaginal buds. We have already\r\nmentioned this for the thorax. As the appendages of the thorax in the\r\npupa gradually attain perfection, the hypodermis layer spreads from the\r\nplace of their insertion, the layer consisting of numerous small cells\r\nwhose origin we must refer to the peripodal membrane. This layer\r\ncontinues to spread over the surface of the pupal thorax, while at the\r\nsame time the area of the larval hypodermis, consisting of large cells,\r\nis seen to diminish. Hence the thin edge of the newly-formed hypodermis\r\n(Fig. 631, _hi_) slowly grows into the space between the superficial\r\ncuticula and the larval hypodermis (Fig. 632, _h_), so that at this\r\nplace the old hypodermis undergoing destruction eventually lies on the\r\ninner side of the newly-formed epithelial layer (_B_). We therefore see\r\nfrom this that, during the replacement of the old hypodermis by the new,\r\nthe continuity of the superficial epithelium is never interrupted. Since\r\nthe edges of the two kinds of hypodermis overlap, the surface of the\r\nbody is nowhere bare of epithelium. The dissolution of the larval\r\nhypodermis is accomplished under the influence of the leucocytes (Fig.\r\n632, _k_), which attack the larval hypodermis-cells and absorb their\r\ncontents piece by piece, and so fill themselves with bits of the\r\nhypodermis-cells and their nuclei; since these fragments have the shape\r\nof roundish granules, they were called by Weismann granule-balls. These\r\ngranule-balls, which fill the body-cavity of the later pupal stage, are\r\nnothing else than the leucocytes (blood corpuscles) which have absorbed\r\nthe fragments of tissue of the larval body.\r\n\r\nIt should here be said that the destruction of the larval tissues is not\r\nto be attributed to the previous death of the cells, but is the result\r\nof the action of the leucocytes on tissues which, though weakened in\r\ntheir vital power, are still living. While the completely healthy,\r\nactive tissues, _i.e._ those of the imaginal buds, withstand the attacks\r\nof the leucocytes, the less healthy larval tissues are by the attacks of\r\nthe leucocytes divided into fragments and eaten and digested by them.\r\nThis process is most marked in the histolysis of the larval muscles. The\r\ndestruction of most of the larval organs depends, therefore, on the\r\ncapacity of the amœboid blood-corpuscles for taking food and on\r\nintracellular digestion, as was first shown by Metschnikoff, who has\r\ngiven to these leucocytes the name of “phagocytes.”\r\n\r\nThis process of histolysis goes on in the same way in the head and\r\nabdomen as in the thorax. In the abdomen, as Ganin first proved, there\r\nare in each of the eight segments of which it consists in the larva four\r\nsmall cellular islets or imaginal buds (Figs. 631, _hi_, 632, _i_), from\r\nwhich originate the new hypodermis.\r\n\r\nVan Rees has lately found in the abdominal segments another pair of\r\nsmaller imaginal buds. The four imaginal buds occurring in the last\r\nsegment are situated close to each other, encircling the anal opening\r\n(Fig. 633, _ims_), and take part in the formation of the hind-intestine,\r\nthe rectal pouches and rectal papillæ. To this segment also belong the\r\ntwo pairs of imaginal genital buds (rudiments of the external sexual\r\norgans) which were first found by Künckel d’Herculais in Volucella.\r\n\r\nThe newly formed hypodermis spreads rapidly over the outer surface of\r\nthe body, so that hypodermal areas corresponding to the separate\r\nimaginal buds soon unite. Simultaneously with this completion of the\r\ndefinite epithelial layer the larval hypodermis becomes completely\r\ndestroyed by the phagocytes.\r\n\r\n=The muscles.=—A similar process of destruction by phagocytes affects\r\nthe greater number of the larval muscles, except the three pairs of\r\nthoracic muscles employed in respiration, and which pass intact from the\r\nlarva to the imago. Indeed, the dissolution of the muscles is the first\r\nprocess which occurs in the metamorphosis. The destruction of the larval\r\nmuscles is accomplished in such a way that, a great number of leucocytes\r\nwhich have collected on the surface of the muscular fibres, press\r\nthrough the sarcolemma and enter within the muscular tissue, filling the\r\nspaces formed between them, By this means the muscles break up into a\r\nnumber of rounded particles which are taken into the interior of the\r\nleucocytes. Thus a collection of granule-balls arise from the muscles,\r\nwhich finally separate from each other and become scattered throughout\r\nthe body-cavity of the pupa. In the same way as the muscular substance,\r\nthe muscle-nuclei are taken up and digested by the phagocytes.\r\n\r\nThe imaginal muscles develop from the definitive mesoderm which has\r\noriginated from the mesoderm of the imaginal buds (Fig. 632, _C_, _m_).\r\n\r\n=The digestive canal.=—As in the hypodermis and muscles, the histolysis\r\nof the larval digestive tract and its new formation from separate\r\nimaginal buds go on simultaneously, so that the continuity of the\r\nprocess is not interrupted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 633.—Digestive tract of a Musca larva with the imaginal germs:\r\n    _bd_, cœca; _s_, food-reservoir; _is_, imaginal ring of the salivary\r\n    gland (_sp_); _f_, fat-cells at the end of the salivary gland; _pr_,\r\n    proventriculus; _r_, its ring; _ie_, imaginal cells of the\r\n    mid-intestinal epithelium; _ch_, chyle-stomach; _ma_, urinary tubes;\r\n    _im_, imaginal cells of the mid-intestinal, muscular layer; _ims_,\r\n    binder, abdominal, imaginal buds; _h_, hind intestinal, imaginal\r\n    bud; _ht_, hind-intestine.—After Kowalevsky, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe imaginal buds of the much-shortened pupal digestive canal occur in\r\nthe mid-intestine (stomach) in the form of numerous scattered groups of\r\ncells (Fig. 633, _ie_), and in the fore- and hind-intestine in the form\r\nof rings (_v_ and _h_) of imaginal tissue. The imaginal ring of the\r\nfore-intestine (_v_) lies in the region of the proventriculus (_pr_,\r\ncompare Fig. 635, _im_), while that of the hind-intestine is situated\r\ndirectly behind the base of the urinary tubes. The regeneration of these\r\ntwo parts of the digestive canal is not entirely accomplished by these\r\ntwo rings, but the imaginal rudiments of the neighboring parts of the\r\nouter surface of the body also have a share in it. Thus it appears that\r\nthe foremost part of the œsophagus is built up from the imaginal buds in\r\nthe region of the mouth, while the imaginal buds surrounding the anus in\r\nthe 8th abdominal segment (Fig. 633. _ims_) produce by invagination the\r\nrectal pouches, together with the rectal papillæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 634.—Cross-section through the mid-intestine of pupa of Musca:\r\n    _e_, rejected and degenerate epithelium of the larval stomach; _f_,\r\n    cellular layer newly formed around the same; _m_, muscular layer;\r\n    _m′_, imaginal cell of _m_; _o_, imaginal bud of the mid-intestinal\r\n    epithelium; _t_, tracheal stem.—After Kowalevsky, from Korschelt and\r\n    Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 635.—Longitudinal section through the proventriculus of a muscid\r\n    larva: _im_, fore-intestinal, imaginal ring; _oe_, œsophagus; _pr_,\r\n    proventriculus.—After Kowalevsky, from Korschelt and Heider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe formation of the mid-intestine (stomach) takes place in such a way\r\nthat the island-like imaginal buds spread out by cell-multiplication\r\nover the outer or basal surface of the larval mid-intestinal epithelium\r\n(Fig. 634, _o_), until they finally unite, so as to form the wall of the\r\nimaginal mid-intestine (stomach). At the same time the entire larval\r\nepithelium (_e_) is cast in the interior and forms the so-called yellow\r\nbody, which becomes surrounded by a layer of small cells and a\r\njelly-like mass, and remains until its destruction in the pupal stomach.\r\nThe larval muscular layer (_m_) remains intact as long as the imaginal\r\nmid-intestine is not fully developed, when it is attacked and destroyed\r\nby phagocytes. The final muscular layer arises from single cells lying\r\non the outer surface of the imaginal buds (Figs. 633, _im_, 634, _m′_),\r\nwhich should be regarded as special imaginal cells of the mid-intestinal\r\nmuscular layer.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the fore-intestine is introduced by a degeneration\r\nof the proventriculus and sucking stomach. The proventriculus (Fig. 635,\r\n_pr_), which had been formed from a circular fold of the fore-intestine,\r\ndisappears by the smoothing out of this folded structure. The sucking\r\nstomach also similarly degenerates by withdrawing gradually into the\r\nœsophagus, so that instead of the original diverticulum there remains\r\nonly an enlargement of the œsophageal cavity. At the same time this part\r\nof the canal is attacked and destroyed by phagocytes, while the\r\ndestroyed portions become replaced by the gradually extending imaginal\r\nparts of the wall. The imaginal ring of the fore-intestine (Fig. 635,\r\n_im_), which, according to Kowalevsky, is concerned in the formation of\r\na great part of the definitive œsophagus, becomes closed at its hinder\r\nend so that the communication with the mid-intestine appears to be\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nThe hind-intestine of the imago is rebuilt in exactly the same manner.\r\nHere also the imaginal ring widens and forms a tube, which while it\r\ngrows around the openings into the urinary tubes, closes itself against\r\nthe mid-intestine, while behind it remains in connection with the larval\r\nhind-intestine. In a similar way the larval hind-intestine is attacked\r\nby the growth from behind of an imaginal ring, which proceeds from\r\nimaginal buds near the anus, until finally, when the entire larval\r\nhind-intestine is reduced to granule-balls, the two imaginal sections of\r\nthe tube are brought into contact with each other. (Kowalevsky in\r\nKorschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  The larval salivary glands (Fig. 633, _sp_) are completely destroyed\r\n  by phagocytes. Then succeeds the new formation of these glands from\r\n  imaginal buds, which, according to Kowalevsky, form rings situated\r\n  at their anterior ends.\r\n\r\n  The nature of the transformation undergone by the urinary tubes is\r\n  not yet well ascertained. According to Van Rees, there is in this\r\n  case perhaps a regeneration of the larval cells by division, but on\r\n  the other side there may be a histolysis of these elements.\r\n\r\nThe above-described method of transformation of the digestive canal\r\nseems, according to Korschelt and Heider, to be very common among the\r\nholometabolic insects. It has not only been observed in the Diptera, but\r\nalso in the Lepidoptera (Kowalevsky, Frenzel), Coleoptera (Ganin), and\r\nHymenoptera (Ganin). The stripping off of the epithelium of the\r\nmid-intestine was found by Kowalevsky to occur also in Corethra, Culex,\r\nand Chironomus.\r\n\r\n=The tracheal system.=—As we have seen (p. 448), the tracheal system of\r\ncaterpillars just before pupation undergoes disintegration, accompanied\r\nby a reformation of the peritoneal membrane and tænidia. The larval\r\nectotrachea undergoes histolysis, that of the imago being meanwhile\r\nformed; the larval tænidia also break up, dissolve, and are replaced by\r\nnew tænidia which arise from the nuclei of the peritoneal membrane. That\r\nthe tracheal system in the Muscidæ during metamorphosis undergoes a\r\ntransformation is shown, as Korschelt and Heider claim, by the entirely\r\ndifferent shape of the system in the maggot, the pupa, and the fly. The\r\nair is admitted to the tracheal system of the maggot, not by lateral\r\nopenings, but through the two stigmata at the end of the body. On the\r\nother hand, the pupa breathes by prothoracic spiracles, while the fly\r\nhas six pairs of lateral stigmata of the normal structure. There may be\r\nin the larva and pupa vestigial closed stigmata, as there are in the\r\nthorax of caterpillars, with tracheal branches leading to where were\r\nonce functional stigmata. These stigmatal branches, as well as some\r\nother portions of the tracheal system already observed by Weismann,\r\nseem, according to Van Rees, to function as imaginal buds for the\r\nregeneration of the tracheal matrix, while frequently also a\r\nregeneration of this epithelium, by a simple repeated division of cells,\r\nmay be recognized. The disintegration of the tracheal system is\r\naccomplished by means of phagocytes in the manner already described.\r\n\r\n=The nervous system.=—The central nervous system passes directly from\r\nthe larval into the imaginal stage, since it must continue to exercise\r\nmost of its functions throughout metamorphosis, though it undergoes\r\nimportant changes of form and position. At the same time, certain\r\nhistological transformations occur which may be regarded as a\r\nhistolysis. Such is the destruction and rebuilding in the interior of\r\nthe organs, which, however, preserve their continuity. Every case of\r\ndestruction of tissues in the pupa has come to be regarded as a\r\nhistolysis.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the transformation of the peripheral nervous system is\r\nnot yet well understood. Although during the destruction of the larval\r\nmuscles the motor nerves also in part degenerate, in the case of the\r\nnerves distributed to the appendages the conditions are different, as\r\nthese may be recognized in the larva in the form of the nerve-threads\r\nwhich place the imaginal buds in connection with the central nervous\r\nsystem. These threads, according to Van Rees, pass from the larva into\r\nthe pupa and imago, so that with the farther development of the\r\nrudiments of the extremities, only the distal part of the nerves\r\nbelonging to them are to be regarded as new formations. (Korschelt and\r\nHeider.)\r\n\r\n=The fat-body.=—The larval fat-body is also destroyed through the\r\nactivity of the leucocytes in the same way as the other tissues. The\r\nreformation of the fat-body seems to begin in the mesoderm of the\r\nimaginal buds. Possibly, also, the masses or collections of embryonic\r\ncells which are regarded by Schaeffer as “blood-forming cells,” may\r\nserve to regenerate the fat-body. At all events, they have been derived\r\nfrom the mesodermal tissues. Though Wielowiejsky saw the fat-body of\r\nCorethra arising from a cell-layer situated under the hypodermis, yet it\r\nis not necessary to regard this observation as favorable to the view of\r\nSchaeffer that in Musca the larval fat-body is derived in part from the\r\nhypodermis, and in part from the tracheal matrix, thus from the\r\nectodermal tissues. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n=Definitive fate of the leucocytes.=—We have seen that the formation of\r\nthe organs of the imago originates in the imaginal buds, in all cases\r\nwhere these do not pass directly from the larva into the pupa. The\r\nleucocytes, whose numbers in the pupa are greatly increased, take no\r\ndirect part in the formation of the tissues. Their importance seems to\r\nlie in this, that they destroy those larval organs doomed to\r\ndestruction, the parts of which they take in and digest, and possibly,\r\nby their powers of locomotion, convey particles of food to the\r\ndeveloping organs.\r\n\r\nWhat, on the other hand, is the fate of the leucocytes after the\r\ndevelopmental processes in the pupa have ceased? There can be no doubt\r\nthat a part of the so-called granule-cells are again transformed into\r\nnormal blood-corpuscles. Another, and, as it seems, more considerable,\r\nshare suffer degeneration. Finally, the leucocytes themselves serve as\r\nnourishment for the newly formed tissues. Of interest in this direction\r\nis the observation of Van Rees, that numerous leucocytes finally pass\r\ninto the newly-formed hypodermis and then degenerate in crevices between\r\nthe hypodermis-cells. (Korschelt and Heider.)\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested by Van Rees that the phagocytes attack all the\r\n  larval organs indiscriminately, but that the active metabolism of\r\n  the imaginal buds preserves them from these attacks. He also thinks\r\n  that Kowalevsky is probably right in supposing that the buds render\r\n  themselves immune by some poisonous secretion.\r\n\r\n  Pratt, however, thinks that the supposition of a protecting or\r\n  poisonous secretion is scarcely necessary to account for the\r\n  phenomenon, and suggests that the larval tissues are a prey to the\r\n  phagocytes, because at the end of larval life they become\r\n  functionless and inactive, so as to become an easy prey to\r\n  phagocytes or disintegrating influences of any sort. On the other\r\n  hand, the imaginal buds “in which there is an exceedingly active\r\n  metabolism, and _all the larval organs which remain functional\r\n  during the metamorphosis_ are immune from the attacks of the\r\n  phagocytes. The heart in the muscids continues to beat, as Künckel\r\n  d’Herculais has observed, during the entire period of the\r\n  metamorphosis, with the exception of a day or two in the latter half\r\n  of it. The nervous system must continue functional during the entire\r\n  time. The three pairs of thoracic muscles which pass intact from the\r\n  larva to the imago are probably employed in respiration during the\r\n  metamorphosis. The reproductive glands are, like the imaginal disks,\r\n  rapidly growing organs.” He adds that among the other holometabolic\r\n  insects many or most of the larval organs remain functional during\r\n  metamorphosis, hence there is but little histolysis. “But the larval\r\n  intestine would always necessarily become unfunctional, and, as we\r\n  have seen, Kowalevsky is of the opinion that the larval mid-gut in\r\n  all holometabolic insects contains imaginal disks, and undergoes\r\n  degeneration during the metamorphosis.”\r\n\r\n=The post-embryonic changes and imaginal buds in the Pupipara\r\n(Melophagus).=—The sheep-tick (Melophagus) is still more modified than\r\nthe Muscidæ; the larva is apodous and acephalous, but, as Pratt\r\nobserves, much less highly specialized than those of muscids, and in\r\nrespect to the position of the thoracic buds it closely resembles\r\nCorethra. They lie just beneath the hypodermis in two very regular rows,\r\nand not in the centre of the body, as in Musca (Figs. 628, 636, _C_).\r\nWhile, however, in Corethra all the thoracic buds are of larval origin,\r\narising after the last larval moult, in Melophagus, on the other hand,\r\neach of these buds, except the dorsal prothoracic, arises in the embryo,\r\nas is also the case in Musca.\r\n\r\nIn the cephalic buds the conditions are similar to those in Musca, but\r\nstill more complicated. Instead of a single pair of head-buds, there are\r\ntwo pairs, one dorsal and one ventral. “The dorsal pair corresponds to\r\nthe muscidian head-disks in every respect; they are destined to form the\r\ndorsal and lateral portions of the imaginal head, together with the\r\ncompound eyes. The ventral head-disks have no counterpart in Musca. The\r\nfate of these disks or buds is to form the ventral portion of the head,\r\nthe paired projections forming the rudiments of the proboscis.\r\n\r\n“The formation of the head-vesicle proceeds in a way similar to that in\r\nMusca. The ventral disk fuses early at its lateral edges with the dorsal\r\npair. The communications between both ventral and dorsal disks and the\r\npharynx rapidly widen (in the old larva they have already become very\r\nlarge), and soon the disks and pharynx form together a single vesicle,\r\nwhich is the head-vesicle.” The imaginal buds of the abdomen Pratt finds\r\nto be exactly as in the corresponding ones of Musca.\r\n\r\nIn the embryo of Melophagus the cephalic and thoracic imaginal buds\r\nfirst appear as local thickenings, followed by the invagination of the\r\nectoderm; the cephalic buds first appear very early in the ontogeny of\r\nthe insect (Fig. 636, _C_), just as the germs of the digestive canal,\r\nnervous system, and tracheæ are appearing. The single median thickening\r\n(_v_) is destined to form the ventral cephalic bud, while the pair of\r\nthickenings behind (_d_) become the dorsal buds, those homologous with\r\nthe cephalic buds of Musca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 636.—Imaginal buds in Musca,—_A_, in Corethra,—_B_, in\r\n    Melophagus,—_C_, in embryo of Melophagus: dorsal view of head; _b_,\r\n    bud; _p_, peripodal membrane; _c_, cord; _hy_, hypodermis; _cl_,\r\n    cuticula; _st_, stomodæum; _v_, ventral cephalic bud, behind are the\r\n    two dorsal cephalic buds (_d_).—After Pratt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe thoracic buds, which arise as hypodermic thickenings, do not appear\r\nuntil late in embryonic life, until the time of the involution of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nPratt did not observe in the embryo the buds of the internal organs and\r\nof the abdominal hypodermis, and thinks it probable that they appear\r\nfirst in the larva.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _c._ General summary\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera,\r\nand with little doubt in all the holometabolous insects, the parts of\r\nthe imago originate in single formative cellular masses (imaginal buds)\r\nalready present in the larva, and often even in the later embryonic\r\nstages. There are such imaginal buds for each part of the body,—for the\r\nappendages of the head, for the legs and wings, for the ovipositor, and\r\nprobably for the cercopods, for the hypodermis of the abdomen, and for\r\nthe different sections of the digestive canal. We have seen, as\r\nKorschelt and Heider state, that the formation of the mesodermal organs\r\nof the imago (muscles, connective tissue, fat-body) begins in the\r\nmesodermal part of the imaginal buds, whose first origin is still\r\nobscure. Simultaneously with the formation of the imaginal organs, there\r\ngoes on under the influence of the leucocytes the destruction of the\r\nlarval organs. Both processes (destruction and regeneration) therefore\r\ngo on hand in hand, so that the continuity of the organs in question in\r\nmost cases remains perfect, inasmuch as the complete destruction only\r\nensues after the formation of the final organs. The only exceptions are\r\nmost of the muscles of the larva, which are destroyed at a very early\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is evident that the sharp division into larval, pupal, and\r\nimaginal stages only applies to the external surface of the body, since\r\nthey follow one another after successive moults. The processes of the\r\ninternal development, on the other hand, form an entirely continuous\r\nseries of transformations between which is no sharp line of demarcation.\r\nYet as a whole the form of the larva, pupa, and imago are kept distinct\r\nin adaptation to their separate environments and habits.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Pratt very truly remarks, the epigenetic period in insects,\r\nwhen new organs are forming, does not end with the birth of the larva\r\nfrom the egg, but extends through the larval, and even through the pupal\r\nperiod. “The principal significance of the pupal period and the\r\nmetamorphosis is that it is the time when the larval characters which\r\nwere adapted for use during a period of free life in the midst of the\r\ndevelopment, and which would be valueless to the imago, are corrected or\r\nabandoned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HYPERMETAMORPHISM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an insect passes through more than the three normal stages of\r\nmetamorphosis, _i.e._ the larval, pupal, and imaginal, it is said to\r\nundergo a _hypermetamorphosis_. The best-known examples are the\r\nsupernumerary stages of Meloë, Stylops, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 637.—Hypermetamorphosis of male of _Aspidiotus nerii_: 1, freshly\r\n    hatched larva; 2, larva shortly before pupating; _b_, rudiments of\r\n    the legs; _fl_, of the wings; 3, pupa before moulting; 4, the same\r\n    after moulting; 6, larva farther advanced than in 2; _a_, antennal\r\n    rudiments; _b_, rudiments of legs; _v_, stomach; _OG_, brain; _M.\r\n    Fl_, rudiments of the elevator and depressor muscles of the wing;\r\n    _M.

In\r\n_Aspidiotus nerii_ there are five stages, there being two larval (1, 2)\r\nand two pupal stages (3, 4, 7). Stage 3 (Fig. 637, 2) may be compared\r\nwith the pro-pupa stage of Riley (Fig. 581).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 638.—_Mantispa interrupta_, and side view of the same without\r\n    wings: natural size.—Emerton _del._ _a_, freshly-hatched campodeoid\r\n    larva of _Mantispa styriaca_, enlarged; _b_, the same, but older,\r\n    before the first moult; enlarged.—Brauer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have already, on page 602, described the hypermetamorphosis of the\r\nneuropterous insect Mantispa (Fig. 638).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 639.—Triungulin (_a_) of a Californian Meloë: _b_, the three\r\n    triungulin claws; _c_, antenna; _d_, maxillary palpus; _e_, labial\r\n    palpus; _f_, mandible; _g_, an abdominal joint; _h_, imago, ♀; _i_,\r\n    antenna of ♂.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Meloë the freshly hatched larva, or “triungulin” (Fig. 639, _a_), is\r\nan active Campodea-like larva, which runs about and climbs up flowers,\r\nfrom which it creeps upon the bodies of bees, such as Anthophora and\r\nAndrena, who carry it to their cells, wherein their eggs are situated.\r\nThe triungulin feeds upon and destroys the eggs of its hostess.\r\nMeanwhile its inactive life in the bee’s cell reacts upon the organism;\r\nafter moulting, the-second larval form (Fig. 640, _b_) is attained, and\r\nnow the body is thick, cylindrical, soft, and fleshy, and it resembles a\r\nlamellicorn larva, with three pairs of rather long thoracic legs. This\r\nis Riley’s carabidoid stage. This second larva feeds upon the honey\r\nstored up for the young or larval bees. After another moult, there is\r\nanother entire change in the body; it is motionless, the head is\r\nmask-like without movable appendages, and the feet are represented by\r\nsix tubercles. This is called the semipupa or pseudo-pupal stage. This\r\nform moults, and changes to a third larval form (_c_), when apparently,\r\nas the result of its rich, concentrated food, it is overgrown,\r\nthick-bodied, without legs, and resembles a larval bee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 640.—Oil-beetle: _a_, first larva; _b_, second larva; _c_, third\r\n    larva; _d_, pupa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 641.—History of Sitaris: _a_, triungulin or 1st larva; _g_, anal\r\n    spinnerets and claspers of same; _b_, 2d larva; _e_, pseudo-pupa;\r\n    _f_, 3d larva; _c_, true pupa; _d_, imago, ♀.—After V. Mayet, from\r\n    Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter thus passing through three larval stages, each remarkably\r\ndifferent in structure and in the manner of taking food, it transforms\r\ninto a pupa of the ordinary coleopterous shape (_d_).\r\n\r\nThe history of Sitaris, as worked out by Fabre and more recently by\r\nValery-Mayet, is a similar story of two strikingly different\r\nadaptational larval forms succeeding the triungulin or primitive larval\r\nstage. The first larva (Fig. 641, _a_) is in general like that of Meloë,\r\nthe second (_b_) is thick, oval, fleshy, soft-bodied, and with minute\r\nlegs, evidently of no use, the larva feeding on the honey stored by its\r\nhost. The pseudo-pupal stage is still more maggot-like than in the\r\ncorresponding stage of Meloë, and the third larva (_f_) is thick-bodied,\r\nwith short thoracic legs.\r\n\r\nIn the complicated life-history of another cantharid, _Epicauta\r\nvittata_, as worked out by Riley (Fig. 642), we have the same\r\nacquisition of new habits and forms after the first larval stage, which\r\nevidently were at the outset the result of an adaptation to a change of\r\nfood and surroundings. The female Epicauta lays its eggs in the same\r\nwarm, sunny situation as that chosen by locusts (Caloptenus) for\r\ndepositing their eggs. On hatching, the active minute carnivorous\r\ntriungulin, ever on the search for eggs, on happening upon a locust egg\r\ngnaws into it, and then sucks the contents. A second egg is attacked and\r\nits contents exhausted, when, owing to its comparatively inactive habits\r\nand rich nourishing food after a period of inactivity and rest, the skin\r\nsplits along its back, and at about the eighth day from beginning to\r\ntake food the second larva appears, with much smaller and shorter legs,\r\na much smaller head, and with reduced mouth-parts. This is the\r\ncarabidoid stage of Riley. After feeding for about a week in the egg a\r\nsecond moult occurs, and the change of form is slight, though the\r\nmouth-parts and legs are still more rudimentary, and the body assumes\r\n“the clumsy aspect of the typical lamellicorn larva.” This Riley\r\ndenominates the scarabæidoid stage of the second larva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 642.—_Epicauta cinerea_: _a_, end of 2d larval stage; _b_,\r\n    portion of dorsal skin; _c_, _d_, coarctate larva; _e_, _f_,\r\n    pupa.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter six or seven days there is another transformation, the skin being\r\ncast, and the insect passes into another stage, “the ultimate stage of\r\nthe second larva.” The larva, immersed in its rich nutritious food,\r\ngrows rapidly, and after about a week leaves the now addled and decaying\r\nlocust eggs, and burrows into the clear sand, where it lies on its side\r\nin a smooth cell or cavity, and where it undergoes an incomplete\r\necdysis, the skin not being completely shed, and assumes the semipupa\r\nstage, or coarctate larval stage of Riley.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the partly loose skin is rent on the top of the head and\r\nthorax, and then crawls out of it the “third larva,” which only differs\r\nfrom the ultimate stage of the second larva “in the somewhat reduced\r\nsize and greater whiteness.” The insect in this stage is said to be\r\nrather active, and burrows about in the ground, but food is not\r\nessential, and in a few days it transforms into the true pupa state.\r\n\r\nThese habits and the corresponding hypermetamorphosis are probably\r\ncommon to all the Meloidæ, though the life-history of the other species\r\nhas yet to be traced.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Hornia described by Riley, the wings of the imago are more\r\nreduced than in any other of the family, both sexes having the elytra as\r\nrudimentary as in the European female glow-worm (_Lampyris noctiluca_).\r\nThese, with the simple tarsal claws and the enlarged heavy abdomen, as\r\nRiley remarks, “show it to be a degradational form.”\r\n\r\nIts host is Anthophora, and the beetle itself lives permanently in the\r\nsealed cells of the bee, and Riley thinks it is subterranean, seldom if\r\never leaving the bee gallery. The triungulin is unknown, but the\r\nultimate stage of the second larva, as well as the coarctate larva, is\r\nlike those of the family in general, the final transformations taking\r\nplace within the two unrent skins, in this respect the insect (Fig. 643)\r\napproaching Sitaris.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that as the result of its semi-parasitic mode of life\r\nthe Campodea-form or triungulin larva of these insects, which has\r\nfree-biting mouth-parts like the larvæ of Carabidæ and other carnivorous\r\nbeetles, instead of continuing to lead an active life and feeding on\r\nother insects; living or dead, and then like other beetles directly\r\ntransforming into the normal pupa, moults as many as five times, there\r\nbeing six distinct stages before the true pupa stage is entered upon. So\r\nthat there are in all eight stages including the imaginal or last stage.\r\n\r\nOne cannot avoid drawing the very obvious conclusion that the five extra\r\nstages constituting this hypermetamorphosis, as it is so well styled,\r\nare structural episodes, so to speak, due to the peculiar parasitic mode\r\nof life, and were evidently in adaptation to the remarkable changes of\r\nenvironment, so unlike those to which the members of other families of\r\nColeoptera, the Stylopidæ excepted, have been subjected. The fat\r\novergrown body and the atrophied limbs and mouth-parts are with little\r\ndoubt due to the abundant supply of rich food, the protoplasm of the egg\r\nof its host, in which the insect during the feeding time of its life is\r\nimmersed. Since it is well known that parthenogenesis is due to over, or\r\nat least to abundant nutrition, or to a generous diet and favoring\r\ntemperature, there is little reason to doubt that the greatly altered\r\nand abnormally fat or bloated body of the insect in these supernumerary\r\nstages is the result of a continuous supply of rich pabulum, which the\r\ninsect can imbibe with little or no effort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 643.—1, Egg-pod of _Caloptenus differentialis_ with the mouth\r\n    torn open, exposing the newly hatched larva of _Epicauta vittata_ (1\r\n    _a_) eating into an egg and the passage which it made through the\r\n    mucous covering; natural size. 2, dorsal view of the 1st larva, or\r\n    triungulin, of _E. vittata_; 2 _a_, one side of the head of same\r\n    from beneath, greatly enlarged so as to show the mouth-parts; 2 _b_,\r\n    terminal joint of maxillary palpus, showing imbrications and\r\n    flattened inner surface armed with stout points; 2 _c_, leg, showing\r\n    more plainly the tarsal spines; 2 _e_, labrum; 2 _d_, one of the\r\n    abdominal joints from above, showing stout points, stigmata, and\r\n    arrangement of spinous hairs. 3, eggs of _E. vittata_, the natural\r\n    size indicated at side. 4, dorsal view of the carabidoid stage of\r\n    the 2d larva of _E. vittata_: 4 _a_, its antenna; 4 _b_, its right\r\n    maxilla; 4 _c_, its leg; 4 _d_, side view of same, showing its\r\n    natural position within the locust-egg mass. 5, lateral view of the\r\n    ultimate or full-grown stage of the 2d larva of _E. vittata_; 5 _a_,\r\n    portion of the dorsal skin, showing short setaceous hairs. 6, third\r\n    head, or that from the scarabæidoid stage of the 2d larva of _E.\r\n    vittata_ from beneath, showing the reduction of mouth-parts as\r\n    compared with the first head (2 _a_); 6 _a_, antenna of same; 6 _b_,\r\n    maxilla of same; 6 _c_, mandible of same. 7, fourth head, or that of\r\n    the full-grown larva of _E. vittata_, from above; 7 _a_, leg of\r\n    same; 7 _b_, the breastplate or prosternal corneous piece. 8,\r\n    lateral view of the pseudo-pupa or coarctate larva of _E. vittata_,\r\n    with the partially shed skin adhering behind: 8 _a_, dorsal view of\r\n    same; 8 _b_, its head, from the front; 8 _c_, same from side; 8 _d_,\r\n    tuberculous leg; 8 _e_, raised spiracle; 8 _f_, anal part of same,\r\n    9. lateral view of the true pupa of _Epicauta cinerea_ Forst: 9 _a_,\r\n    ventral view of same. 10, _Epicauta vittata_ (lemniscata or\r\n    trivittate var.). 11, _Epicauta cinerea_ Forst.

The\r\nfemales are viviparous, the young hatching within the body of the\r\nparent, as we once found as many as 300 of the very minute triungulin\r\nlarvæ issuing in every direction from the body of what we have regarded\r\nas the female of _Stylops childreni_ in a stylopized Andrena caught in\r\nthe last of April. The larvæ differ notably from those of the Meloidæ in\r\nthe feet being bulbous and without claws, yet it is in general\r\nCampodea-like and in essential features a triungulin (Fig. 644). The\r\nintestine ends in a blind sac, as in the larvæ of bees, and this would\r\nindicate that its food is honey. The complete life-history of no\r\nStylopid is completely known. It is probable that, hatched in June from\r\neggs fertilized in April, the larvæ crawl upon the bodies of bees and\r\nwasps; finally, after a series of larval stages as yet unknown,[119]\r\npenetrating within the abdomen of its host before the latter hibernates,\r\nand living there through the winter. The females, owing to their\r\nparasitic life, retain the larval form, while the free males are winged,\r\nnot leading in the adult stage a parasitic life, though passing their\r\nlarval and pupal stages in the body of their host, and are so unlike\r\nordinary beetles as to be referred by good authorities to a distinct\r\norder (Strepsiptera).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 645.—_Stylops childreni_, ♂: _a_, abdomen of Andrena with ♀\r\n    Stylops (_b_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe triungulin stage of these insects corresponds in general to the form\r\nof the larval Staphylinidæ and allied families, such as the\r\nTenebrionidæ, which are active in their habits, running about and\r\nobtaining their food in a haphazard way, often necessarily suffering\r\nlong fasts. In the external-feeding, less active coleopterous larvæ,\r\nlike the phytophagous species, which have an uninterrupted supply of\r\nnutritious food, we see that the body is thick and fleshy. So also in\r\nthe larvæ of the Scarabæidæ, Ptinidæ, and the wood-boring groups. In\r\ninternal feeders, like the larval weevils and Scolytidæ, which live\r\nnearly motionless in seeds, fruits, and the sap-wood of plants and\r\ntrees, with a constant supply of nourishing, often rich food, the\r\neruciform body is soft, thick, and more or less oval-cylindrical. So it\r\nis with the larvæ of Hymenoptera, especially in the parasitic forms, and\r\nin the ants, wasps, and bees, which are nearly if not quite motionless,\r\nat least not walking about after their food.\r\n\r\nNow the change from the active triungulin stage to the series of\r\nsecondary, nearly legless, sedentary, inactive stages is plainly enough\r\ndue to the change of station and to the change of food. From being an\r\nindependent, active, roving triungulin, the young insect becomes a\r\nlodger or boarder, fed at the expense of its host, and the lack of\r\nbodily exertion, coupled with the presence of more liquid food than is\r\nactually needed for its bare existence, at once induces rotundity of\r\nbody and a loss of power in the limbs, followed by their partial or\r\ntotal atrophy.\r\n\r\nThat this process of degeneration may even occur in one and the same\r\nstage of larval existence is very well illustrated by what we know of\r\nthe life-history of the wasp-parasite of Europe, _Rhipiphorus\r\nparadoxus_. Thanks to the very careful and patient observations of Dr.\r\nT. A. Chapman, we have a nearly complete life-history of this beetle,\r\nthe representative of a family in many respects connecting the Meloidæ\r\nand Stylopidæ.[120] Where Rhipiphorus lays her eggs is unknown. Dr.\r\nChapman, however, found a solitary specimen of the young larva in the\r\ntriungulin stage. He describes it as “a little black hexapod, about 1⁄50\r\ninch (.5 mm.) in length, and 1⁄120 inch in breadth, broadest about the\r\nfourth segment, and tapering to a point at the tail; a triangular head\r\nwith a pair of three-jointed antennæ nearly as long as the width of the\r\nhead, with legs very like those of Meloë larvæ; the tibiæ ending in two\r\nor three claws, which are supported and even obscured by a large\r\ntransparent pulvillus or sucker of about twice their length; this was\r\nmarked by faint striæ radiating from the extremity of the tibiæ, giving\r\nit much the aspect of a lobe of a fly’s proboscis. Each abdominal\r\nsegment had a very short lateral spine pointing backwards; the last\r\nsegment terminated by a large double sucker similar to those of the\r\nlegs; and the little animal frequently stood up on this, and pawed the\r\nair with its feet, as if in search of some fresh object to lay hold of.”\r\n\r\nThis almost microscopic larva finds a wasp grub and bores into its body,\r\nprobably entering at a point near the back of the first or second\r\nsegment behind the head. Dr. Chapman succeeded in finding the larva of\r\nthe beetle within that of the wasp, before the latter had spun up.\r\n“Assuming that the wasp larva lives six days in its last skin before\r\nspinning up, I should guess that the youngest of these had still two or\r\nthree days’ feeding to do. The Rhipiphorus larvæ were but a little way\r\nbeneath the skin of the back, about the fourth and fifth segments\r\n[counting the head as the first], and indifferently on either side. The\r\nsmallest of these was 1⁄16 inch in length, and, except its smaller size,\r\nwas precisely like the larger ones I am about to refer to, having the\r\nsame head, legs, plates, etc. These were of the same size as those of\r\nthe larger larvæ, the difference in size of the latter being due to the\r\nexpansion of the intermediate colorless integument.”\r\n\r\nAfter the wasp grub has spun the silken covering of its cell the larva\r\nof Rhipiphorus may still be detected in some of them, being rendered\r\nvisible by its black legs and dark dorsal and ventral plates. “On\r\nextracting this larva, it bears a general resemblance in size and\r\noutline to the youngest larva of Rhipiphorus that I had found feeding\r\nexternally on the wasp grub, but with the very notable exception of the\r\nalready mentioned black marks. These are, in fact, a corneous head,\r\nsix-jointed legs, and a dorsal and ventral series of plates. I\r\nimmediately recognized the head and legs as identical with those of the\r\nlittle black mite already described, but presenting a ludicrous\r\nappearance in being widely separated from each other by the white skin\r\nof the larva. I have no doubt that the dorsal and ventral series of\r\nblack marks are the corresponding plates of the mite-like larva floated\r\naway from each other by the expansion of the intervening membrane. By\r\nmeasurement also they agree exactly in size, although the larva\r\nextracted from the wasp grub is ten times the length and six times the\r\nwidth of the little Meloë-like larva. In length it is ⅙ inch (4.5 mm.),\r\nand 1⁄28 inch in breadth.”\r\n\r\nThe remarkable changes thus described in the larva of this beetle after\r\nit has begun its parasitic life within the body of its host are\r\nespecially noteworthy because the great increase in size and difference\r\nin shape, as well as in habits, all take place before the insect has\r\nmoulted. The rapid development in size, and consequent distension of the\r\nbody and the separation of the sclerites of the segments behind the\r\nhead, are paralleled, as Chapman says, by the greatly swollen abdominal\r\nregion of the body in _Sarcopsylla penetrans_ and in the female of the\r\nTermitidæ. In those insects this distension is due to the enlargement of\r\nthe ovaries and of the eggs contained within them, but in the\r\nRhipiphorus it is due to the comparative inactivity of the larva, and to\r\nits being gorged with an unending supply of rich food, the blood and fat\r\nof its host. It follows, then, that if a sedentary life and over, or at\r\nleast abundant, nutrition will have this effect within the short period\r\ncovered by the single first larval stage of the Rhipiphorus, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that the hypermetamorphosis is also due to the same\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nChapman then goes on to say that finally, within six hours of the time\r\nof spinning up of the wasp grub, the Rhipiphorus larva at the end of\r\nStage 1., which is “usually in motion, and for its situation might be\r\ncalled tolerably active, is seen to lay hold of the interior of the skin\r\nwith its anterior legs, and keeps biting and scratching with its strong\r\nand sharp jaws until it is able to thrust through its head, when, in\r\nless than a quarter of an hour, it completely emerges by a vermiform\r\nmovement; and at the same time it casts a skin, together with the black\r\nhead, legs, plates, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe larva, now in its second stage, passes forward and seizes hold of\r\nthe upper or lateral aspect of the prothoracic segment of the wasp grub.\r\nOn emerging it becomes shorter and thicker, “and very soon loses length\r\nby that curving forward of its head which is so marked in the full-grown\r\nlarva, and which does not exist before its emergence.” The larva is now\r\nfound “lying like a collar immediately under the head of the wasp grub,\r\nand is attached to it by the head, though not very firmly.” At this\r\nstage the feeding of the young Rhipiphorus is rather sucking than\r\neating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 646.—First larva (_a_) of _Bruchus fabæ_, greatly enlarged; _b_,\r\n    thoracic processes; _c_, head, from front; _d_, from side; _e_,\r\n    antenna; _f_, thoracic leg; _g_, rear view of tarsus; _h_, same,\r\n    front view.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen about 6 mm. in length it moults a second time, and the full-grown\r\nlarva closely though superficially resembles a Crabro or Pemphredon\r\nlarva, the small head being bent over forwards. By the time it is ready\r\nto pupate it has wholly eaten the wasp larva, and the temperature of the\r\ncell being high, a larva 5 mm. long grows large enough in two days to\r\nfill the top of the cell of its host, and the larva is ready to pupate\r\nabout a week after hatching, so that its development is very rapid. The\r\nbeetles themselves do not live in the cells. Chapman thinks they\r\nhibernate, and that the eggs are laid in the spring or summer.\r\n\r\nWe thus have in this insect three larval stages, the triungulin, and two\r\nlater stages, the great differences between the first and the last two\r\nbeing apparently due to their parasitic mode of life, the larva spending\r\nits second stage within its host, involving an existence in a cell with\r\na high temperature, an uninterrupted supply of rich, stimulating food,\r\nand a comparatively sedentary mode of life compared with that of the\r\ntriungulin at the beginning of its existence. It is quite obvious that\r\nthe hypermetamorphosis is primarily due to a great change in its\r\nsurroundings, _i.e._ the parasitic mode of life of the beetle, habits of\r\nvery rare occurrence in the Coleoptera, numerous in species as they are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 647.—First larval stage of _Bruchus pisi_: _a_, egg in pea-pod;\r\n    _b_, cross-section of opening of mine; _c_, young larva and opening\r\n    on inside of pod by which it has entered, enlarged; _d_, _d_, _d_,\r\n    eggs, natural size; _e_, 1st larval stage; _f_, a leg of same; _g_,\r\n    prothoracic spinous processes.—After Riley.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn this connection attention may be drawn to a supernumerary larval\r\nstage observed by Riley in the pea- and bean-weevils (Figs. 646 and\r\n647). The larva on hatching has long slender legs, though differing from\r\nthose of an ordinary coleopterous larva in having but three joints (_j_,\r\n_g_, _h_). This stage is very short, and the legs temporary, as, after\r\nentering the bean or pea, it casts its skin, losing its legs, and\r\nassuming the vermiform shape of the second larval stage. In this case\r\nthe change from a pedate to an apodous larva is plainly enough due to\r\nthe change from an external feeder, like a chrysomelid larva, to a larva\r\nleading a boring, internal, almost quiescent life.\r\n\r\nCertain ichneumons also appear to have two distinct larval stages, as\r\nRatzeburg inferred that in Anomalon there are four larval stages (Fig.\r\n648).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 648.—History of _Anomalon circumflexum_: _A_, 1st instar or\r\n    stage. _B_, 2d instar. _C_, larva in the 3d or encysted stage\r\n    removed from its cyst. _D_, mature larva. _E_, pupa.—After\r\n    Ratzeburg, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn another ichneumon, Klapálek detected what he calls the “sub-nymph.”\r\nThe insect pupates within the case of a caddis-fly, Silo (Fig. 649).\r\n\r\nIn the Proctotrypidæ there is also a hypermetamorphosis, though the\r\nremarkable precocious stages they pass through are rather embryonic than\r\nlarval.\r\n\r\nIn a species of Platygaster which is parasitic in the larva of\r\nCecidomia, the first larva (Cyclops stage) is of a remarkable shape, not\r\nlike an insect, but rudely resembling a parasitic Copepod crustacean. In\r\nthis condition it clings to the inside of its host by means of its\r\nhook-like jaws, moving about, as Ganin says, like a Cestodes embryo with\r\nits well-known six hooks. In this stage it has no nervous, vascular, or\r\nrespiratory system, and the digestive canal is a blind one (Fig. 651).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 649.—Metamorphosis of Agriotypus: _A_, larva. _B_, “sub-nymph.”\r\n    _C_, case of the Silo, with the string of attachment formed by\r\n    Agriotypus. _D_, section of the case: _v^1_, operculum of case;\r\n    _v^2_, cocoon; _ag_, pupa of Agriotypus; _e_, exuvia of same; _w^2_,\r\n    wall of cocoon; _s_, remains of Silo; _w^1_, closure of case.—After\r\n    Klapálek, from Sharp.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter moulting, the insect entirely changes its form; it is thick\r\noval-cylindrical, nearly motionless, with no appendages, but with a\r\ndigestive canal and a nervous and vascular system (Fig. 652).\r\n\r\nAfter a second moult the third and last larval stage is attained, and\r\nthe insect is of the ordinary appearance of ichneumon larvæ.\r\n\r\nNot less striking is the life-history of Polynema, which lays its eggs\r\nin those of a small dragon-fly (_Agrion virgo_). The first larval stage\r\nis most remarkable. It hatches as a microscopic immovable being,\r\nentirely unlike any insect, with scarcely a trace of organization, being\r\nmerely a flask-shaped sac of cells. After remaining in this state five\r\nor six days it moults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 650.—Development of Platygaster: _A_, stalked egg: _a_ central\r\n    cell giving origin to the embryo. _B_, _g_, germ; _b_, blastoderm\r\n    cells. _C_, the same, farther advanced. _D_, cyclops-like embryo:\r\n    _md_, rudiments of mandibles; _d_, rudimentary pad-like organs, seen\r\n    more developed in _E_; _st_, bilobed tail.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second stage, or Histriobdella-like form, as Ganin names it, is more\r\nlike that leech-like worm than an insect.\r\n\r\nThe third larval form is very bizarre, though more as in insects, having\r\nrudimentary antennæ, mouth-parts, legs, and ovipositor. In this\r\ncondition it lives from six to seven days before pupating (Fig. 653).\r\n\r\nThe strange history of another egg-parasite (Ophioneurus) agrees in some\r\nrespects with that of the foregoing forms. It is when hatched of an oval\r\nshape, with scarcely any organs, and differs from the genera already\r\nmentioned in remaining within its egg-membrane, and not assuming their\r\nstrange shapes. From the cylindrical sac-like non-segmented larva\r\nresembling the second larva of Platygaster it passes directly into the\r\npupa state.\r\n\r\nA fourth form, Teleas (Fig. 654, _A-D_), is an egg-parasite of Gerris,\r\nand in America one species oviposits in the eggs of Œcanthus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 651.—First larva of Platygaster: _m_, mouth; _at_, rudimentary\r\n    antenna; _md_, mandibles; _d_, tongue-like appendages.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 652.—Second larva of Platygaster: _œ_, œsophagus; _ng_, brain;\r\n    _n_, nervous cord; _ga_ and _g_, genital organs; _ms_, muscular\r\n    band.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe spindle-shaped larva in its first stage roughly resembles a\r\ntrochosphere of a worm rather than the larva of an insect so high in the\r\nscale as a Hymenopter. It is active, but after moulting the second larva\r\nis oval, still without segments. Dr. Ayers gives a profusion of details\r\nand figures of the first and second stages of our Teleas, the second\r\nstrongly resembling the Cyclops stage of Ganin. He describes three\r\nstages, and though he did not complete the life-history of the insect,\r\nhe thinks it changes to an ovoid flattened form which succeeds the\r\nCyclops stage in other Pteromalidæ, and that there are at least four\r\necdyses.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for these strange larval forms, unless we\r\nsuppose that the embryos, by their rich, abundant food, have undergone a\r\npremature development, the growth of the body-walls being greatly\r\naccelerated, the insects so to speak having been, under the stimulus of\r\nover-nutrition and their unusual environment, and perhaps also the high\r\ntemperature of the egg, hurried into vermian existence on a plane\r\nscarcely higher than that of an active ciliated gastrula.\r\n\r\nFurther observations, difficult though they will be, are needed to\r\nenable us to account for the singular prematurity of the embryo of these\r\nparasites. That these stages are reversional and a direct inheritance\r\nfrom the vermian ancestors of these insects is not probable, but the\r\nforms are evidently the result of adaptation in response to a series of\r\nstimuli whose nature is in part appreciable but mostly unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 653.—Third larva of Polynema: _at_, antenna; _fl_, imaginal bud\r\n    of wing; _l_, rudimentary legs; _tg_, buds of one of the three pairs\r\n    of styles of the ovipositor; _fk_, fat-body; _eg_, ear-like process.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 654.—_A-D_, development of Teleas; _A_, stalked egg; _B_, _C_,\r\n    _D_, the 1st larval stage: _at_, antenna; _md_, hook-like mandibles;\r\n    _mo_, mouth; _b_, bristles; _m_, intestine; _sw_, the tail; _ul_,\r\n    under lip or labium. _E_, larva of another parasite,\r\n    Ophioneurus.—This and Figs. 650–653 after Ganin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may be noted, however, that the appearance of a primitive band in the\r\nsecond larval stage suggests the origin of these forms, as well as that\r\nof insects in general, from a Peripatus-like, and again from an earlier\r\nleech-like Annelid ancestor. Hence the first larval or Cyclops stage is\r\ndue to a precocious development caused by the unusual environment, and\r\nis simply adaptational, and not of phylogenetic significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SUMMARY OF THE FACTS AND SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE CAUSES OF METAMORPHISM\r\n\r\n\r\nAn explanation of the causes of metamorphosis is one of the most\r\ndifficult undertakings in biology, and the phenomenon has been\r\nconsidered as one of the chief difficulties in the way of the acceptance\r\nof the theory of descent.\r\n\r\nA review, however, of the facts of hypermetamorphism, particularly the\r\nlife-history of Mantispa, throws much light on the subject, since it is\r\nvery probable that the supernumerary stages and marked changes of form\r\ncharacterizing them are due to changes of environment, of habits, and of\r\nfood, causes which have exerted such a profound influence on organic\r\nbeings throughout all time. Besides these, as the result of changes in\r\nthe environment and nature of the food, we have the results brought\r\nabout by the use or disuse of structures brought into existence by the\r\naction of stimuli from without, the class of insects abounding in\r\nexamples of temporary structures which perform a certain function, and\r\nthen disappear.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the origin of a hypermetamorphosis can thus be explained, it\r\nfollows that normal metamorphosis is most probably due to changes of\r\nhabitat, of seasons, of food, and to accelerated growth resulting from\r\nthe approach of sexual maturity.\r\n\r\nThe following facts and conclusions appear to be well established:—\r\n\r\n1. The apterous insects (Synaptera) are ametabolous, only the winged\r\ninsects undergoing a metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n2. The complete metamorphosis was not inherited from the primitive\r\nancestor of all insects, but acquired at a later period (F. Müller). The\r\neruciform type is a secondary, adaptive form, derived from the earlier,\r\ncampodeoid type of larva.\r\n\r\n3. The earliest, most primitive pterygote insects passed through only a\r\nslight metamorphosis. In other words, as soon as the wings were evolved\r\nand insects became adapted to live or take refuge in a new medium, the\r\nair, at the approach of the period of adult life, with the ripening or\r\nperfection of the reproductive organs, a metamorphosis began to take\r\nplace, and the number of species greatly multiplied. On the other hand,\r\nthe Arachnida and Myriopoda, in which as a rule there is no\r\nmetamorphosis, being confined to a creeping life, with no change of\r\nmedium, remained poor in number of species.\r\n\r\n4. At first the nymphs mainly differed from the adults in lacking wings,\r\nthough having the same habits; in holometabolous insects, the larva\r\nbecame adapted to entirely different habits and environments, so that in\r\nHymenoptera, and especially Diptera, the larva became remarkably unlike\r\nthe imago.\r\n\r\n5. Until the Mesozoic age, or late in the Carboniferous period, there\r\nwere, so far as we now know, only ametabolous and heterometabolous\r\ninsects, and these orders (Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Hemiptera,\r\nPlectoptera, Odonata, and Neuroptera) were not numerically rich in\r\ngenera and species, while since early Mesozoic times geological\r\nextinction has reduced their numbers.\r\n\r\n6. During the Mesozoic age, and since then, the number of species,\r\ngenera, families, and orders has greatly increased, and insects have\r\nbecome more and more holometabolous. The orders of Coleoptera,\r\nLepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera are many fold greater in number of\r\nspecies and variety of form than the heterometabolous orders.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in the number and variety of types of insects\r\nevidently is correlated with the profound geological changes which took\r\nplace at the end of the Paleozoic age, involving the appearance of\r\nlarger continental masses, or a greater land area, thus opening new\r\nregions for settlement. Also the origin of flowering plants at about\r\nthis time undoubtedly had much to do with the genesis of new adaptive\r\nstructures, such as the changes in the mouth-parts and wings.\r\n\r\n7. The process of metamorphosis, at least in the subtropical, temperate,\r\nand polar regions, is largely dependent on the change from summer to\r\nwinter, and, in the tropics, from the rainy to the dry season.\r\n\r\nAs regards the organization of larval (nepionic) as compared with\r\nimaginal forms, the nymphs and larvæ of insects are, with the exception\r\nof many Diptera, nearly as perfectly developed as the adult. In this\r\nrespect the immature insect differs fundamentally from the larvæ of\r\ncertain worms (for example, the pilidium of Nemerteans) and from the\r\npluteus and brachiolaria stages of echinoderms, which possess only\r\ndigestive and water-vascular organs.\r\n\r\nInsect nymphs and larvæ also differ from the nauplius and zoëa of\r\nCrustacea in having at birth all the most important systems of organs\r\n(digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, muscular, with sometimes\r\na nearly perfected reproductive system) of the imago, also the same\r\nnumber of cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal segments and appendages.\r\nMetamorphism in insects involves (except in the Diptera) rather\r\nmodifications in the form and functions of organs and appendages already\r\npresent than the formation of new ones. In larval Crustacea, the\r\nthoracic and abdominal appendages do not arise until some time after\r\nhatching from the egg.\r\n\r\n8. While cases of the suppression or abbreviation of larval characters\r\nand direct development are not uncommon in echinoderms and crustaceans,\r\nin insects this phenomenon occurs only so far as yet known in the\r\nDiptera. In these insects the polypody in the embryo is outgrown, or\r\nlost, the embryos and larvæ not having even the temporary rudiments of\r\nabdominal appendages. The campodeoid characters also are entirely\r\nsuppressed, dropped, or lost in the more specialized holometabolous\r\norders, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera, though retained in the\r\nmore primitive and generalized Coleoptera. (This proves that the\r\nColeoptera are lower or more primitive and generalized than the other\r\norders mentioned.) This abbreviation or loss of organs is, as Hyatt and\r\nArms claim, due to the prepotency of acquired characters in phylogeny,\r\nand are also the result of homochronous heredity.\r\n\r\n  “The Insecta of the more specialized orders, x.-xvi., afford, next\r\n  to some parasites, the most notable examples of this mode of\r\n  evolution. Their larval or nepionic, and pupal or neanic, stages are\r\n  prolonged at the expense of the ephebic, winged stage, and the\r\n  reasons for this prolongation are found in the great number of new\r\n  features introduced into these stages of development in these orders\r\n  as contrasted with those of the more primitive, and, in large part,\r\n  more ancient orders, i.-ix. The law of tachygenesis has been at work\r\n  here, as in the former cases alluded to above, and it is shown in\r\n  the encroachments of the adaptive characteristics of the\r\n  caterpillar, grub, and maggot upon the inherited characteristics of\r\n  the Thysanuran stage, which loses its ancestral characteristics,\r\n  until in most cases they are either obsolete or recognizable with\r\n  difficulty.” (Hyatt and Arms, Natural Science, 1896, p. 400.)\r\n\r\n9. In the holometabolous insects there is a resting, quiescent stage\r\nduring the pupal period, when the insect takes no food. In this respect\r\nthe more specialized insects differ from other metamorphic animals. The\r\nlarva has an abundant supply of fat lasting through pupal life, while in\r\nthe quiescent pupa, respiration and circulation is much lessened, the\r\nanimal being as a rule motionless. This resting stage is also necessary\r\nfor the histolysis and formation of the adult body from the imaginal\r\nbuds present in the larva.\r\n\r\n10. The hypermetamorphosis of Mantispa, Meloë, Stylops, etc., indicate\r\nvery plainly that the eruciform type of larva is derived from the\r\ncampodeoid, since one and the same insect passes through these stages\r\nbefore reaching sexual maturity.\r\n\r\n11. As observed by Miall, the larva of insects differs from that of\r\nother invertebrate animals in being larger than the adult.\r\n\r\n12. The metamorphoses of insects are in some important respects\r\nparalleled by those of the Amphibia. The case of pædogenesis of\r\nChironomus affords a parallel with that of the Siredon, or larva of\r\nAmblystoma. Also the organs and appendages of the insects, such as\r\ncaterpillars, are present, just as the skeleton and other organs of the\r\ntadpole are the homologues of those of the adult, although these parts\r\nundergo a profound modification, and new structures are added. (See the\r\ndiscussion of this point by Miall, and by Hyatt and Arms.)\r\n\r\n=Theoretical conclusions; Causes of metamorphosis.=—It results from a\r\nreview of the known facts, together with reasonable inductions from such\r\nfacts, that so far from opposing the theory of descent, the facts of\r\nmetamorphosis, and particularly of hypermetamorphosis, seem to afford\r\nsolid foundation for the theory. While natural selection was not the\r\ninitiative cause, it plays a part as one of several factors; but the\r\nfundamental causes are the same as those which have controlled the\r\norigin of species and of the larger groups of animals in general. Owing\r\nto the struggle for existence, due to overcrowding, the early insects\r\nwere forced to take to the air, acquiring wings to enable them to avoid\r\nthe attacks of creeping and running insects. In the end the insects\r\nbecame, owing to this acquisition of wings, and afterwards to the\r\nestablishment of a complicated metamorphosis, numerically the most\r\nsuccessful type of life in existence, the number of species, extinct and\r\nliving, mounting into the millions.\r\n\r\nAll aquatic insects are evidently the descendants of terrestrial forms,\r\nand the numberless contrivances and temporary larval organs,\r\nparticularly of dipterous larvæ, are evidently adaptations to the needs\r\nof the insect during its aquatic life, and which are cast aside when the\r\ncreature passes to a different medium. The sudden or tachygenic\r\nappearance of temporary structures, such as hatching spines, various\r\nsetæ, spines, respiratory organs, so characteristic of dipterous larvæ,\r\nand of the protective colors and markings of caterpillars, and which are\r\ndiscarded at pupation, or imagination, are evidently due to the action\r\nof stimuli from without, to the primary neolamarckian factors, the\r\ncharacters proper to each larval stadium, and to the pupal and imaginal\r\nstadia,—characters probably acquired during the lifetime of the\r\nindividual,—becoming finally fixed by homochronous heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       LITERATURE ON POSTEMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT AND METAMORPHOSES\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Herold, Moritz Johann David.= Entwicklungsgeschichte der\r\n    Schmetterlinge anatomisch und physiologisch bearbeitet.

He also states\r\n  that Campodea resembles the myriopods, especially Geophilus, in the\r\n  primitive band at first lying on the surface of the yolk, and in the\r\n  absence of an amniotic cavity; also before hatching the abdomen is\r\n  pressed against the thorax, as in myriopods.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  “Scolopendrella has very remarkable antennæ; they may be compared each\r\n  to a series of glass cups strung upon a delicate hyaline and\r\n  extensible rod of uniform thickness throughout; so that, like the body\r\n  of the creature, they shrink enormously when the animal is irritated\r\n  or thrown into alcohol, and they then possess scarcely two-thirds the\r\n  length they have in the fully extended condition, their cup-like\r\n  joints being drawn close together, one within the other. Peripatus,\r\n  Japyx, many (if not all) Homoptera, and the S. Asiatic relatives of\r\n  our common Glomeris have all more or less extensible antennæ.”\r\n  (Wood-Mason, Trans. Ent. Soc., London, 1879, p. 155.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Lassaigne gave it the name of entomoline.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Miall and Denny ex Krukenberg; Kolbe gives the formula as\r\n  C_{9}H_{15}NO_{6} or C_{18}H_{15}NO_{12}. As the result of his recent\r\n  researches, Krawkow (Zeits. Biol., xxix, 1892, p. 177) states that the\r\n  chemical composition of chitin may prove to be somewhat variable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  On allowing portions of a locust, a piece of the integument of\r\n  Limulus, a scorpion, and a myriopod to soak for a month in white\r\n  potash, neither were dissolved or affected by the reagent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  We may add, while correcting the proofs of this book, that the\r\n  important summary, by Uzel, of his work on the embryology of Campodea\r\n  appears in the Zoologischer Anzeiger for July 5, 1897. He observes\r\n  that the premandibular segment in the embryo is very distinct, and\r\n  that the two projections arising from it persist in the adult.\r\n  “Campodea is now the first example where these appendages are present\r\n  in the sexually mature insect and function as constituents of the\r\n  completed mouth parts. I propose for these hitherto overlooked\r\n  structures the name of intercalary lobes.” They each form a slightly\r\n  developed chitinous lobe covering a gap between the base of the labium\r\n  and the fused external lobe and palpus of the first maxillæ (which are\r\n  inclined near the labium) in place of the mandibles which have sunken\r\n  inward. Uzel also homologizes these appendages with two similar\r\n  projections (Höcker) observed in the embryo of Geophilus by Zograf to\r\n  be situated in front of the mandibles. Heymons has also detected this\r\n  segment in the embryo of Lepisma.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  While these pages are still in type, we may add, in confirmation of\r\n  this view, that Uzel states, from his researches on the embryology of\r\n  Campodea, that the maxillary tergites of the embryo only slightly\r\n  share in building up the tergal region (occiput) of the head, but that\r\n  they form the genæ of the maxillary segments. (Zool. Anzeiger, July 5,\r\n  1897, p. 235.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Miall and Denny in their work on the cockroach, in describing the\r\n  labium, remark: “The upper edge is applied to the occipital frame, but\r\n  is neither continuous with that structure nor articulated thereto. By\r\n  stripping off the labium upwards it may be seen that it is really\r\n  continuous with the chitinous integument of the neck” (p. 95). This\r\n  is, we think, a mistaken view, as proved by the embryology of the\r\n  Odonata and of Nematus. Our statements on this subject were first\r\n  published in part in 1871, and more fully in the third Report, U. S.\r\n  Ent. Commission, 1883, pp. 284, 285. We also stated that all the gular\r\n  region of the head probably represents the base of the primitive\r\n  second maxillæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  After we had arrived at this conclusion, and written the above lines,\r\n  we received the Zoologischer Anzeiger for March 29, 1897, in which Dr.\r\n  N. Léon publishes the same view, stating that each side of the\r\n  submentum is the homologue of the cardo, and each side of the mentum\r\n  corresponds to the stipes of a single maxilla (p. 74).\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Miall and Denny were the first to homologize the paraglossæ with the\r\n  galea and lacinia, showing the complete resemblance of the second\r\n  maxillæ to the first pair, remarking that “the homology of the labium\r\n  with the first pair of maxillæ is in no other insects so distinct as\r\n  in the Orthoptera.” We have also independently arrived at a similar\r\n  conclusion, but believe that the mentum corresponds to the first\r\n  maxillary cardo, and the palpifer to the first maxillary stipes, the\r\n  sclerite of each maxilla being fused to form the base of the labium,\r\n  _i.e._ the unpaired mentum and submentum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Uzel states that what is regarded as the ligula of Campodea is formed\r\n  from the sternite of the first maxillary segment; while the two parts\r\n  regarded as paraglossæ grow out from the sternite of the mandibular\r\n  segment, and these three structures together he regards as the\r\n  hypopharynx.

(Archives de Biologie,\r\n  Liège, 1890.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Carlet and also De Moor (1890) confirm Graber’s statement that in\r\n  beetles the first and last appendages on the same side are in contact\r\n  with the ground, while the middle one is raised. On the other side of\r\n  the body the middle appendage is on the ground and the first and last\r\n  one raised.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Trans. Amer. Ent.

See p. 8,\r\n  footnote.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Pancritius, who also adopted Müller’s views, lays much stress on the\r\n  fact that in larvæ of some orders the tracheæ do not enter the\r\n  rudimentary wings until the end of larval life, and hence the wings\r\n  have not originated from tracheal gills, but were originally “perhaps\r\n  only protective covers for the body.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from the author’s remarks in Third Report U. S. Ent.\r\n  Commission, pp. 268–271, 1883.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Von Lendenfeld, however, points out the fact that Straus-Durckheim\r\n  proved that the wings of beetles are moved by a complicated system of\r\n  numerous muscles. “In the Lepidoptera I have never found less than six\r\n  muscles to each wing, as also in the Hymenoptera and Diptera.” “The\r\n  motions of the wings of Libellulidæ are the combined working of\r\n  numerous muscles and cords, and of a great number of chitinous pieces\r\n  connected by joints.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Heymons, however, denies that the so-called cerci in Odonata are such,\r\n  and claims that they are the homologues of the “caudal processes”\r\n  (superior terminal appendages of Calvert), because they arise from the\r\n  tenth abdominal segment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Amer. Nat., iv, December, 1870.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Handbuch der Zoologie, p. 17, 1863, Fig. 162.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  In my account of the anatomy of _Melanoplus spretus_, 1st Report U. S.\r\n  Entomological Commission, p. 259, I have called these the infra-anal\r\n  flaps or _uro-patagia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested to us by A. A. Packard that the power possessed\r\n  by insects of transporting loads much heavier than themselves is\r\n  easily accounted for, when we consider that the muscles of the legs of\r\n  an insect the size of a house-fly (¼ inch long), and supporting a load\r\n  399 times its own weight, would be subjected to the same stress (per\r\n  square inch of cross-section) as they would be in a fly 100 inches\r\n  long of precisely similar shape, that carried only its own weight;\r\n  from the mechanical law that, while the weight of similar bodies\r\n  varies as the cube of the corresponding dimensions, the area of\r\n  cross-section of any part (such as a section of the muscles of the\r\n  leg) varies only as the square of the corresponding dimensions. In\r\n  short, the muscles of a fly carrying this great proportional weight\r\n  undergo no greater tension than would be exerted by a colossal insect\r\n  in walking.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  This has been shown to be the case by Michels, who states that each\r\n  commissure is formed of three parallel bundles of elementary\r\n  nerve-fibres, which pass continuously from one end of the ventral or\r\n  nervous cord to the other. “The commissures take their origin neither\r\n  out of a central punctsubstanz (or marksubstanz), nor from the\r\n  peripheral ganglion-cells of the several ganglia, but are mere\r\n  continuations of the longitudinal fibres which decrease posteriorly in\r\n  thickness, and extend anteriorly through the commissures, forming the\r\n  œsophageal ring, to the brain.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  The following extract from Newton’s paper shows, however, that the\r\n  infra or subœsophageal ganglion, according to Faivre, has the power of\r\n  coördinating the movements of the body; still, it seems to us that the\r\n  brain is primarily concerned in the exercise of this power, as the\r\n  nerves from the subœsophageal ganglion supply only the mouth-parts.\r\n  “The physiological experiments of Faivre in 1857 (Ann. des Sci. Nat.\r\n  tom. viii, p. 245), upon the brain of Dyticus in relation to\r\n  locomotion, are of very considerable interest, showing, as they appear\r\n  to do, that the power of coördinating the movements of the body is\r\n  lodged in the infraœsophageal ganglion. And such being the case, both\r\n  the upper and lower pairs of ganglia ought to be regarded as forming\r\n  parts of the insect’s brain.”—Quart. Jour. Micr. Sc., 1879, p. 342.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  The arthropod protocerebrum probably represents the annelid brain\r\n  (supraœsophageal ganglion). The antennal segment (deutocerebrum), with\r\n  the premandibular (intercalary) segment (tritocerebrum) originally\r\n  postoral, have, as Lankester suggests, in the Arthropoda moved forward\r\n  to join the primitive brain. See Wheeler, Journ. Morphology, Boston,\r\n  viii, p. 112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Viallanes’ assertion that the instincts of the horse-flies and\r\n  dragon-flies are “lower” than those of the locusts, may, it seems to\r\n  us, well be questioned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  A.

I counted about\r\n  90 pits on each cercus. They are much larger and much more numerous\r\n  than similar pits in the antennæ of the same insect. I compared them\r\n  to similar pits in the antennæ of the carrion-beetles, and argued that\r\n  they were organs rather of the smelling than hearing. (Amer. Nat.,\r\n  iv., Dec. 1870.) Organs of smell in the flies (Chrysopila) and in the\r\n  palpi, both labial and maxillary, of Perla were described in the same\r\n  journal (Fig. 270). Compare Vom Rath’s account of the organs in the\r\n  cercopods of Acheta (Fig. 271); also the singular organ discovered by\r\n  him on the end of the palpus of butterflies, in which a number of\r\n  hair-like rods (_sh_) are seated on branches of a common nerve (_n_,\r\n  Fig. 272).\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Forel, however (_Recueil Zoologique Suisse_, 1887), denies that these\r\n  tympanic organs are necessarily ears, and thinks that all insects are\r\n  deaf, with no special organs of hearing, but that sounds are heard by\r\n  their tactile organs, just as deaf-mutes perceive at a distance the\r\n  rumbling of a carriage. But he appears to overlook the fact that many\r\n  Crustacea, and all shrimps and crabs, as well as many molluscs, have\r\n  organs of hearing. The German anatomist Will believes that insects\r\n  hear only the stridulation of their own species. Lubbock thinks that\r\n  bees and ants are not deaf, but hear sounds so shrill as to be beyond\r\n  our hearing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Weismann, Die nachembryonale Entwicklung der Musciden.

The acidity quite often observed is only very\r\n  accessory in character, and not the sign of a physiological property.\r\n  “Farther, I have found it in insects; Hoppe-Seyler has demonstrated in\r\n  the Crustacea, and I have proved in the spiders, that the ferment\r\n  causing the digestion of albuminoids is evidently quite different from\r\n  the gastric pepsine of vertebrates; the addition of very feeble\r\n  quantities of chlorhydric acid, far from promoting its action, retards\r\n  or completely arrests it.” (Bull. Acad. roy. Belgique, 1877, p. 27.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  The word _grès_ we translate as the layer of gum. Not sure of the\r\n  English equivalent for _grès_, I applied to Dr. L. O. Howard, U. S.\r\n  Entomologist, who kindly answers as follows: “I have consulted Mr.\r\n  Philip Walker, a silk expert, who writes me the following paragraph:\r\n  ‘_Grès_, as I understand it, is the gum of the silk fibre, hence the\r\n  French name for raw silk, _grèye_, which is in distinction to the silk\r\n  that has been boiled out in soap after twisting, or throwing, as it is\r\n  called. As I understand it, the silk fibre is composed of the _grès_\r\n  and fibroin. The former is soluble in alkali, like soap water, and the\r\n  latter is not.’” While Blanc considers the _grès_ as the product of a\r\n  special secretion of the wall of the reservoir, Gilson regards its\r\n  production as simultaneous with that of the silk or of the fibroin\r\n  (_l.c._ 1893, p. 74).\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  On cytological differences in homologous organs.

In the first case a cover-slip is placed on the fluid,\r\n  and the crystals, which consist of oblique rhombohedrons or derived\r\n  forms, are usually at once apparent. If sulphuric acid is used, the\r\n  fluid must be allowed to evaporate. In this case they are much more\r\n  elongated, and usually clustered. The murexide reaction does not give\r\n  satisfactory indications with the tubules of the cockroach.” (Miall\r\n  and Denny, The cockroach, p. 129, footnote.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  “There is a curious analogy between the excretory organs of these\r\n  insects and the mesonephros of some vertebrates, where a second,\r\n  third, etc., generation of tubules is added to the primitive metameric\r\n  series.

In the\r\n  embryo of _Isotoma walkerii_ we, however, observed a membrane which we\r\n  compared to the larval skin of many Crustacea, and both Sommer and\r\n  Lemoine have detected in eggs of the same group a cuticular larval\r\n  skin which is provided with spines for rupturing the chorion. The\r\n  amnion is also wanting in Proctotrupids (Ayers), and is rudimental in\r\n  Muscidæ (Kowalevsky, Graber), in viviparous Cecidomyidæ, according to\r\n  Metschnikoff, who also states that in certain ants of Madeira the\r\n  envelopes are represented only by a small mass of cells in the dorsal\r\n  region.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  In Diptera the stomodæum may be dorsal, Dr. Pratt tells us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Will (Aphis) and also Cholodkowsky’s statement (Blatta), as well as\r\n  Balfour and Schimkewitch’s statements that the brain is at first\r\n  disconnected from the ventral cord, are apparently erroneous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  The description perhaps applies not only to the cockroaches, but, as\r\n  seen from the similar but fragmentary notices of Heider and of Wheeler\r\n  on the Coleoptera, may be common to insects in general.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Report on the Rocky Mountain locust, etc. Ninth Annual Report U.

Hatchett-Jackson states his belief that Riley’s homology\r\n  of the sustentors with the soles or plantæ of the anal prolegs, and\r\n  the sustentor ridges with their limbs, is wrong, and that the\r\n  eminences on either side the anal furrow, or the “anal prominences,”\r\n  as they are termed by Riley, represent the prolegs, and that the\r\n  sustentor ridges and sustentors are probably peculiar developments of\r\n  the body of the 10th somite, found only in some Lepidoptera. From our\r\n  examination of pupa of different families of moths, we are satisfied\r\n  that Jackson’s view is the correct one. We have not found the\r\n  sustentors and their ridges in the pupæ of the more generalized moths,\r\n  but the vestiges of the anal legs are almost invariably present, their\r\n  absence in the pupa of Nola and Harrisina being noteworthy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  We copy from Kirby and Spence their abstract of Herold’s conclusions:\r\n  “The successive skins of the caterpillar, the pupa-case, the future\r\n  butterfly, and its parts or organs, except those of sex, which he\r\n  discovered in the newly excluded larva, do not preëxist as germs, but\r\n  are formed successively from the _rete mucosum_, which itself is\r\n  formed anew upon every change of skin, from what he denominates the\r\n  _blood_, or the chyle after it has passed through the pores of the\r\n  intestinal canal into the general cavity of the body, where, being\r\n  oxygenated by the air-vessels, it performs the nutritive functions of\r\n  blood. He attributes these formations to a _vis formatrix_ (bildende\r\n  Kraft).\r\n\r\n  “The caul or epiploon (_fett-masse_), the _corps graisseux_ of\r\n  Réaumur, etc., which he supposes to be formed from the superfluous\r\n  blood, he allows, with most physiologists, to be stored up in the\r\n  larva, that in the pupa state it may serve for the development of the\r\n  imago. But he differs from them in asserting that in this state it is\r\n  destined to two distinct purposes: first, for the production of the\r\n  muscles of the butterfly, which he affirms are generated from it in\r\n  the shape of slender bundles of fibres; and, secondly, for the\r\n  development and nutrition of the organs formed in the larva, to effect\r\n  which, he says, it is dissolved again into the mass of blood, and\r\n  being oxygenated by the air-vessels, becomes fit for nutrition, whence\r\n  the epiploon appears to be a kind of concrete chyle.”\r\n  (Entwickelungsgeschichte der Schmetterlinge, pp. 12–27.) It seems that\r\n  Herold was right in deriving the pupa and imago from the hypodermis\r\n  (his _rete mucosum_), but wrong in denying that the germs did not\r\n  preëxist in the young caterpillar, and wrong in supposing that the\r\n  latter originated from the blood, also in supposing that the muscles\r\n  owe their origin to the fat-body. Swammerdam, and also Kirby and\r\n  Spence, were correct in supposing that the imago arose from “germs” in\r\n  the larva, though wrong in adopting the “emboîtement” theory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  In the regions where the imaginal buds are not present (dorsal aspect\r\n  of the prothorax, and abdomen), the epithelium (hypodermis) may\r\n  proliferate independently of these buds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  We shall translate portions and, when the text allows, make an\r\n  abstract of parts of Gonin’s clear and excellent account, often using\r\n  his own words.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  C.
