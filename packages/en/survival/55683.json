If it is true that 'Fortune favors the\r\nbrave', it seems to me she is a long time in finding out that there is\r\nsuch a fellow as Bob Jennings in the world, for the harder I work, the\r\nworse I get along.\"\r\n\r\nAs the fisher-boy spoke, he pulled up his anchor, hoisted a small\r\ntattered sail in the bow of his boat, and filled away for home, as poor\r\nas when he set out in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Bob felt somewhat disheartened, for he was but\r\ntwelve cents better off at that moment than he had been the day before.\r\nHe had ferried six ship-carpenters across the harbor that morning, and\r\nthen pulled five miles up the bay, to his fishing-grounds, only to\r\nreturn empty-handed. And that was not the worst of it, for a \"streak of\r\nbad luck,\" as he called it, had attended him during the entire week. It\r\nwas then Friday; and since Monday morning he had earned just a dollar\r\nand a quarter. Fishing had been unprofitable, and the ship-carpenters\r\nseemed to have taken a sudden dislike to his boat, for, of late, he\r\nhad never been able to secure more than half a load, and his ferrying\r\ndid not yield him twenty cents a day. He had worked hard, but luck\r\nwas against him, and, in spite of all his exertions, he had not been\r\nable to earn enough to pay the week's expenses; and that morning his\r\nmother had told him that she would soon be obliged to use a portion of\r\nthe fifteen dollars which Bob had managed to save as part of the sum\r\nnecessary to support the family while he was gone on his first voyage\r\nat sea. Bob had been expecting this; and it was the worst part of his\r\nweek's \"streak of bad luck,\" for that fifteen dollars had been saved\r\nfor a special purpose, and he did not want to see it used for any thing\r\nelse. He had staked all his hopes upon the result of this day's work,\r\nand thus far he had earned but twelve cents. Some boys, perhaps, would\r\nhave thought fifteen dollars a very insignificant sum to be troubled\r\nabout, but Bob looked upon it as quite a respectable fortune. There\r\nwere not many fisher-boys about Newport who could boast that, during\r\nthe last six months, they had fed and clothed a family of four persons,\r\nand saved money besides. Bob was the only one among them who ever laid\r\nby a penny for a rainy day; but, unless his luck soon changed, he would\r\nbe as poor as the rest of them--his fortune would melt away, and his\r\nfirst voyage be indefinitely postponed. The fisher-boy was not in the\r\nhabit of grumbling because every thing did not work as smoothly as he\r\ndesired, but, under such circumstances, he found it almost impossible\r\nto keep up a cheerful heart. He was willing to work, but he wanted\r\nto see that he was making some headway in the world. When fortune\r\nfavored him, and he could give his mother fifty, or even twenty-five,\r\ncents every evening, there was not a happier boy in Newport than Bob\r\nJennings. He felt rich; and it is probable that he would even have\r\nhesitated about changing places with his friend Tom Newcombe, whom\r\nhe sometimes envied. But when luck went against him--as had been the\r\ncase during the week that had just passed--Bob could not help getting\r\ndownhearted, for it seemed to him that every failure he made placed\r\nthe object of his ambition farther beyond his reach. He wanted to\r\nbecome the master of a fine vessel, but he could not go to sea leaving\r\nhis mother unprovided for; and thirty dollars would be sufficient to\r\ninsure her against want during his absence. After nearly six months'\r\nhard work, he had saved half the amount required, and he had begun to\r\nhope that, by the time the spring arrived, he could give up fishing\r\nand ferrying, turn his scow over to his brother, and enter upon his\r\ncareer as a sailor. But Bob's hopes had been ruined more than once by\r\na \"streak of bad luck,\" and now it seemed as if misfortune was again\r\nabout to overtake him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to see that fifteen dollars broken in upon,\" said the\r\nfisher-boy, taking a firmer grasp of the oar with which he was steering\r\nhis clumsy craft, as if to indicate that he had determined to hold on\r\nto his fortune as long as possible; \"I've worked hard for it, through\r\nstorm and sunshine, have gone about my work ragged and barefooted,\r\nand now, if I lose it, I shall almost believe that I was born to be a\r\nfisherman, and that it's no use for me to try to be any thing else. If\r\nthis money goes, it will be the third time I have been bankrupt. After\r\nmother agreed to let me go to sea if I would save thirty dollars, I\r\nwent to work, and, at the end of three months, I had seven dollars in\r\nthe bank. I was making money fast, and I thought that, at the end of\r\nthe year, I should have more than thirty dollars laid by. But I had a\r\nstreak of bad luck; the fish wouldn't bite, I couldn't make a dime a\r\nday ferrying, and four dollars out of the seven had to go to feed the\r\nfamily. After awhile, my luck changed again, and, in four months, I had\r\nsaved twelve dollars and a half. Then I began to fall behind a second\r\ntime, and every red cent of my twelve dollars was gone before I knew\r\nit. Then came a streak of good luck, which lasted almost six months,\r\nand, during that time, I saved just fifteen dollars. If that goes like\r\nthe rest, I shall begin to believe that I am very unlucky. Now, there's\r\nSam Barton! He doesn't work half as hard as I do, but he makes more\r\nmoney. I wish I had been in his place night before last.\"\r\n\r\nBob was not the only one who envied Sam Barton, for he was the most\r\nfortunate ferry-boy about the village. His companions all looked upon\r\nhim with a great deal of respect; and the reason was because Sam owned\r\nthe best boat, and could boast of more \"regular customers\" than any\r\nother boys about the harbor. On Wednesday evening, after the workmen\r\nhad all been taken across, and the ferry-boys were seated in their\r\nboats, counting their money, and getting ready to start for home, a\r\ngentleman, who was standing on the wharf talking to an acquaintance,\r\naccidentally slipped off into the water. A dozen boats at once started\r\nto his assistance; but Sam was foremost, and, reaching the gentleman\r\njust as he was sinking for the last time, he seized him and lifted\r\nhim into his boat. The man soon recovered from the effects of his\r\ninvoluntary bath, and, on being assisted on to the wharf, he thrust his\r\nhand into his pocket, and, pulling out a large roll of bills, tossed it\r\nto Sam; after which, he stepped into a carriage and was driven off. The\r\nferry-boys, who had been interested spectators of all that had taken\r\nplace, crowded up around Sam's boat; and when the latter had counted\r\nthe money, he found himself the proud possessor of a hundred dollars--a\r\nmuch larger sum than he had ever owned before. The idea of a reward\r\nmust have entered Sam's head the moment he saw the gentleman struggling\r\nin the water, for, after he had put the money carefully away in his\r\npocket, he turned to Bob, who had been close beside him all the while,\r\nand coolly remarked:\r\n\r\n\"You're a purty good hand with an oar, Bobby Jennings, an' I'll allow\r\nthat you can make that ar ole scow of your'n fly through the water\r\namazin' fast, but it wasn't no use fur you to think of beatin' me in\r\nthis race, 'cause I was pullin' fur money--I was. I knowed the ole chap\r\nwould give a feller a dime or two fur haulin' him out of the water, fur\r\nI seed he couldn't swim the minute he fell in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" said Bob, \"but I never thought of a reward; I only wanted\r\nto save the man's life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose, then,\" said Sam, \"that if you had been first, an' had pulled\r\nthat feller into your boat, an' he had said 'Thank you, Bobby,' you\r\nwould have been satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I would!\" replied the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Sam, thrusting his hand into his pocket to satisfy\r\nhimself that his money was safe, \"mebbe that's a good principle to go\r\non, but it won't bring you much bread an' butter--not more'n you can\r\neat, any how. I believe a feller has a right to make all he can. In\r\ncourse, he oughter work, 'cause he'll soon starve if he don't; but when\r\nhe sees a chance to make a few dollars easy, he oughtn't to let it\r\nslip. The world owes us ferry-boys a livin', an' the easier we make it,\r\nthe smarter we be. But, 'pears to me, if I was a rich man, an' should\r\nfall into the harbor, an' couldn't swim a stroke, I'd give the feller\r\nthat pulled me out more'n a hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, when Sam came among his companions, the appearance of\r\nhimself and boat excited the wonder and admiration of every ferry-boy\r\nin the harbor. His yawl had received a fresh coat of paint outside; and\r\nthe thwarts were supplied with cushions, so that his passengers might\r\nhave the benefit of easy seats. Sam was rigged out in a brand-new suit\r\nof clothes, and he sculled about among the ferry-boys as if he felt\r\nhimself to be very important.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of me an' my yawl, now, Bobby Jennings?\" asked\r\nSam, as he dashed up along-side the fisher-boy, who was seated in his\r\nscow watching the wharves on both sides of the harbor, in the hope of\r\ndiscovering a passenger. \"Ain't we gay? That hundred dollars came in\r\nhandy, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your boat looks very nice,\" replied Bob, glancing first at the clean,\r\ndry yawl, and then at his own unpainted, leaky craft. \"She's a great\r\ndeal better than mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's to be expected,\" said Sam; \"you see, I've got capital to go\r\non, and I know how to use it. I was onct as poor as you be; the boat\r\nI had was a'most as leaky an' dirty as that ar craft of your'n, and I\r\nnever could make enough to pay expenses, 'cause the ship-carpenters\r\nan' the fine gentlemen who have business across the harbor wouldn't\r\nhave nothing to do with me. One day, my old man said to me: 'Sammy, a\r\ncoward an' a poor man are the two meanest things in the world. They are\r\na disgrace to society. If you ever want to be respected, go to work an'\r\nmake some money.' I thought that was good advice, and I follered it.\r\nNow look at me! I've got two good boats--the other a nice little skiff\r\nthat I want to sell to some feller who has twenty dollars to pay for\r\nit--I wear good clothes, I've got more regular customers than any two\r\nother boys in the harbor, an' every night I take home at least a dollar\r\nand a half. I'm makin' money; an' the reason is, I know how to do it.\r\nDuring two years' ferryin' on this harbor, I have learned that the only\r\nway to get custom is to have a nice, clean boat----Yes, sir; comin',\r\nsir!\"\r\n\r\nSam Barton was a boy who could do two things at once--that is, he\r\ncould talk and keep a bright lookout for passengers at the same\r\ntime--and he had just discovered a man standing on the wharf, waving\r\nhis handkerchief--a sign that he wanted to cross the harbor. Bob saw\r\nhim at the same moment, and, by the time Sam had got his oar out,\r\nthe fisher-boy was well under way, and Sam began to fear that the\r\ntwo cents he had hoped to earn would find their way into the pockets\r\nof his rival. \"First come, first served,\" was the law in force among\r\nthe ferry-boys, and the one who could handle his oar the best got the\r\nmost passengers. There was not a boy in the harbor who could beat\r\nBob sculling, and although he had a heavy, unwieldy boat to manage,\r\nhe generally came off first best in his races. He certainly did in\r\nthis instance, for, when he reached the wharf where the passenger was\r\nstanding, Sam was a long way behind.\r\n\r\n\"Jump in, sir,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\nThe man looked down at the scow, which, on account of its numerous\r\nleaks, could not be kept very clean, then at his well-blacked boots,\r\nand shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"O, she'll take you over safely, sir,\" said Bob; \"I've carried fifteen\r\nmen in her many a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheer off there, Bobby Jennings!\" shouted Sam Barton, bringing his\r\nhandsome yawl along-side the wharf at this moment; \"here's the boat\r\nthe gentleman's been a-waitin' fur. He wants a neat, tidy craft, wi'\r\ncushions to sit down on. Jump in, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea Sam had advanced but a few moments before--that a nice, clean\r\nboat was necessary to secure patronage--received confirmation now, for\r\nthe man climbed down into the yawl, and Bob saw his rival pocket the\r\npassage-money.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy thought over these incidents, as he sat in the\r\nstern-sheets of his scow sailing slowly homeward from his\r\nfishing-grounds; and, although Sam Barton had, at first, fallen very\r\nlow in his estimation, by accepting a reward for saving a man's life,\r\nhe was now ready to wish that he had been in Sam's place.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only think of some honest way to earn a hundred dollars,\r\nhow proud I should feel!\" said the fisher-boy. \"It would support the\r\nfamily in fine style for a year to come, and would buy a good many\r\narticles of furniture that we need in the house. It would send me to\r\nsea, too, and I would then be in a situation to make a man of myself.\r\nI might, some day, become the captain of one of Mr. Newcombe's fine\r\nships.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point in his meditations, when the fisher-boy was imagining how\r\ngrand he would feel when he should walk the quarter-deck of his own\r\nvessel, he was suddenly startled with the shout:\r\n\r\n\"Look out there, you ragamuffin! Out of the way, or we'll run you\r\ndown!\" And the next moment, a beautiful little schooner, filled with\r\nboys about his own age, dashed by, under a full press of canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!\" shouted the boy who held the helm of the schooner; \"What\r\nship is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's the 'Go Ahead,'\" said one of his companions, reading the\r\nname which was painted in rude letters on the stern of Bob's scow.\r\n\r\n\"So it is!\" said another. \"But I don't think the name is appropriate,\r\nfor she don't seem to go ahead at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys in the schooner laughed loudly at this exhibition of wit,\r\nand the little vessel dashed on, leaving Bob sitting in the stern of\r\nhis scow, silent and thoughtful. This incident had brought him back\r\nto earth again. The gallant ship, of which he had imagined himself\r\nthe proud commander, faded before his eyes, and he found himself\r\nseated at the helm of his leaky boat, with its tattered sail and empty\r\nfish-basket staring him in the face. The trim, swift-sailing little\r\nschooner, which had so nearly run him down, and which was now bounding\r\ngayly over the waves of the bay, with its load of merry, thoughtless\r\nboys, presented a strange contrast to his own clumsy craft, and, but\r\nfor one simple thing, Bob would have been more disheartened than ever.\r\nBut one of the boys had called him a \"ragamuffin;\" while the others had\r\nmade sport of his boat and the odd name she bore, and this aroused the\r\nfisher-boy's spirit.\r\n\r\n\"They don't know what they were talking about,\" said Bob to himself. \"I\r\ndidn't give my scow that name on account of her sailing qualities, for\r\nno one who knows any thing about a boat would expect a tub like this to\r\nsail fast. I call her the 'Go Ahead' because that's part of my motto,\r\nand I want it where I can see it when I get down-hearted.\"\r\n\r\nBob hesitated, and even looked as if he felt ashamed of himself as he\r\nsaid this, for he remembered that but a few moments before he had been\r\nsadly discouraged, and had never once thought of his motto. It was\r\nstrange that he had forgotten it, for the words \"Go Ahead,\" painted\r\nin huge capitals, stared at him from every part of the boat to which\r\nhe could direct his gaze. On the thwarts, the gunwales, the oar with\r\nwhich he was steering, and even on the bottom, where the water stood\r\nthree inches deep, appeared the mysterious words, which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, never failed to prove a sure source of cheerfulness and\r\ncontentment to the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"They called me a ragamuffin,\" continued Bob, looking down at his\r\npatched garments, \"and perhaps I am; but I know one thing, and that\r\nis, a ragged coat has covered the back of many an honest man. I believe\r\nI am honest, for I never, knowingly, cheated a man out of a cent. My\r\ncustomers are not afraid to trust me, for they believe just what I\r\nsay, and never look at the scales when I am weighing out the fish. Sam\r\nBarton says, that poor men and cowards ought not to be allowed to live\r\nin the world; but mother says, poverty is no disgrace if a person works\r\nhard and tries to better his condition. I won't always be a ragamuffin,\r\nnow I tell you! I'll own a sail-boat one of these days that will make\r\nthat schooner ashamed of herself. How will I get it?\" added Bob aloud,\r\nas if some invisible person had just asked him the question. \"How will\r\nI get it? I'll work for it; that's the way I'll get it. I'll stick to\r\nmy ferrying and fishing until something better turns up, and then I'll\r\nmake a man of myself.\"\r\n\r\nAs the fisher-boy said this, he gave one parting glance at the\r\nschooner, and then turned his attention to the management of his scow.\r\nHis feelings now were very different from what they had been when he\r\nbegan his voyage homeward, for the sneering remarks of the schooner's\r\ncrew had aroused his pride and indignation. He was willing to admit\r\nthat he was a ragamuffin, but he was determined that he would not\r\nalways remain one. He was ambitious to be something better; and, like a\r\nsensible boy, he knew there was but one way for him to accomplish his\r\nobject, and that was to work hard for it.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage homeward, Bob thought over his situation, and\r\nrevolved in his mind numerous plans for future operations; but the\r\nonly conclusion he could come to was, to \"stick to his business\" and\r\ndo the best he could. He might have accepted a situation in some\r\nstore; in fact, one or two had been offered him--for Bob, like every\r\nother honest, industrious boy, had plenty of friends--but that would\r\nnot better his condition as far as money was concerned. His wages\r\nwould amount to but a dollar and a half or two dollars a week, and at\r\nthat rate he could not save a cent. Even fishing and ferrying were\r\ngenerally more profitable; for, although some weeks he would make\r\nscarcely enough to pay expenses, he would, at other times, clear three\r\nand four dollars, so that his mother could lay by something to increase\r\ntheir little fortune. His present \"streak of bad luck\" could not last\r\nalways; it would soon change in his favor, and, until then, he would\r\nwork on and hope for the best. There were numerous obstacles and\r\ndiscouragements in his way, and the greatest of them was the want of a\r\ngood boat. The Go Ahead had done him considerable service, but she was\r\nso old and shaky that, with the exception of Bob, there was scarcely\r\na boy in Newport who was brave enough to trust himself very far from\r\nshore in her. It was no wonder, then, that the ship-carpenters gave the\r\nfisher-boy a wide berth, and preferred Sam Barton's staunch yawl to his\r\nleaky scow. The question, How should he get a new boat? had troubled\r\nhim for three months, and he was not yet able to answer it. At first he\r\nhad thought of building one; but he had no money to buy the necessary\r\nmaterial, and the planks and boards that got loose in the harbor were\r\nalways picked up before Bob knew they were there. He could not buy a\r\nboat, for such a one as he wanted would cost twenty or thirty dollars;\r\nand where could he obtain so much money? This question perplexed Bob\r\ngreatly, and now it seemed to trouble him more than ever. He did not\r\nrecover his usual spirits again that afternoon, and, when he ran his\r\nscow upon the beach in front of his humble home, he wore an exceedingly\r\nlong face, which told the family, as plainly as words, that his day's\r\nwork had not been a profitable one.\r\n\r\n\"How many, Bobby?\" asked his mother, appearing at the door.\r\n\r\n\"So many!\" replied the fisher boy, inverting his basket, to show that\r\nit was empty. \"I hope I shall have better luck to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nBob threw his basket on the beach, pulled down his sail, and, after\r\nrolling it up, carried it around behind the house, and put it in its\r\naccustomed place. He then walked round to the other side of the cabin,\r\nand eagerly read some rude characters which he had cut in the boards,\r\nclose up under the eaves. This was, no doubt, an unusual way to raise\r\none's spirits, but it seemed to have that effect upon Bob, for he shook\r\nhis head and whispered to himself:\r\n\r\n\"I'm not discouraged yet. If a boy lives up to that motto, he'll make a\r\nman of himself, I don't care how poor he is.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time the fisher-boy had drawn encouragement and\r\nconsolation from this same mysterious source, for, every day, after\r\nhe returned from his fishing grounds, he would steal around behind\r\nthe house to read his motto. If he had been unlucky, he did it to\r\nraise his spirits; and if he had been successful, he read it with a\r\nrenewed determination to \"stick to it.\" What it was that served to\r\nencourage him, no one about the house knew except himself. His mother\r\nhad often seen the characters cut in the boards, but she could not\r\nread them, for they were so rudely executed that they bore but very\r\nlittle resemblance to the letters of the alphabet. Bob could use a pen\r\nor pencil very well, but he had never learned the art of engraving,\r\nand that was the reason no one could read the words he had cut in the\r\nboards.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" repeated Bob, \"that motto will make a man of me yet, if I\r\nlive up to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of a person who became rich by it?\" asked one of his\r\nbrothers, who had followed him behind the house.\r\n\r\n\"No, but still I believe it will work wonders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it will; but it don't seem to be working wonders just now.\r\nYou have not caught a single fish to-day, and mother says that, if you\r\ndon't earn thirty cents to-night, she will have to use part of your\r\nfifteen dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThirty cents! That was a small amount to stand between Bob and his\r\nfortune, but it might as well have been as many dollars, for he had no\r\nidea that he should be able to secure a load of fifteen ship-carpenters\r\nthat evening. He thought of his leaky scow, then of Sam Barton's fine\r\nboat, and wished that he was able to own one exactly like it. But\r\nwishing did no good. It would not bring him another boat, or change\r\nthe Go Ahead into a handsome yawl, with cushioned seats; so Bob, after\r\nanother glance at the letters under the eaves, dismissed all thoughts\r\nof Sam Barton and his boat, and turned his attention to bailing out his\r\nscow. In half an hour the boat had been emptied of the water, and wiped\r\ndry, after which the fisher-boy pushed off from the beach, and sculled\r\ntoward the harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA LIBERAL PASSENGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy's home, as we have said, was built upon the beach, and\r\nwas but one of a dozen similar abodes, where dwelt as many boys, who,\r\nlike Bob, earned their living by fishing and ferrying. They all made\r\nit a point to be in the harbor at half-past six in the morning, and at\r\nfive in the evening; and, when Bob pushed off from the beach, he soon\r\nfound himself in the midst of a small fleet of boats, of all sizes\r\nand descriptions, whose ragged crews were bent on the same mission as\r\nhimself. These boys were mostly the sons of sailors and fishermen;\r\nsome of them, like Bob, looking forward to the day when they should be\r\nthe masters of fine vessels; while the majority, with no care for the\r\nmorrow, were content to follow the occupations of their fathers, and\r\nwere willing to remain fishermen all their lives. Bob was, perhaps, the\r\npoorest one among them, as fortunes were reckoned in Fishertown--which\r\nwas the name given to that part of the village where the fishermen\r\nlived. Their boats constituted their only wealth, and a boy's fortune\r\nwas measured by the size and condition of his craft. The boys were all\r\ngood judges of boats, and there was not one among them who did not\r\nlaugh whenever Bob made his appearance in the harbor. On the evening\r\nin question, when he came up with the little fleet, he was greeted with\r\na chorus of shouts and yells that would have made most boys angry.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes Bobby Jennings in his washing-tub!\" shouted one of the\r\nferry-boys, as Bob sculled slowly past him. \"Clear the track!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the term \"washing-tub\" does not give one a very good idea of\r\nthe appearance of the fisher-boy's scow, it was, perhaps, the most\r\nappropriate name that could have been applied to her, for she bore\r\nbut very little resemblance to any thing in the shape of a boat that\r\nhad ever been seen about the village. She was built of heavy planks,\r\nwhich Bob had picked up at the upper end of the harbor; and, having\r\nno plane with which to dress them down to an equal thickness, he had\r\nbeen obliged to use the boards as he found them; consequently, one\r\nside of the scow was heavier than the other; and this made her \"tip\"\r\nconsiderably, as if she was always on the point of capsizing. The\r\nfisher-boy had made an attempt to shape the stem and stern exactly\r\nalike, but, having nothing but a dull ax to work with, he had only\r\nsucceeded in giving the Go Ahead a very homely model, for the bow was\r\nlong and slanting, and the stern stood almost straight up and down in\r\nthe water. Of the planks that formed the bottom, some were thick and\r\nothers thin, and the joints were caulked with rags and bits of rope\r\nwhich Bob had picked up about the wharves. This unwieldy craft was\r\npropelled by an oar worked over the stern; and, although she made but\r\npoor headway under sail, she could be pushed through the water at an\r\nastonishing rate of speed, especially when the sight of a passenger on\r\nthe wharf induced the fisher-boy to put forth all his power of muscle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" shouted another of the ferry-boys, \"here comes Jennings and\r\nhis lumber-yard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the fisher-boy, good-naturedly, \"if you think you can beat\r\nthis lumber-yard, this is a first-rate chance to try it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy very wisely declined to accept the challenge. He had seen\r\nthe Go Ahead make remarkably fast time, and he did not like to risk the\r\ndisgrace of being beaten.\r\n\r\nAs the boats were all moving along leisurely, Bob soon took the lead,\r\nand presently he rounded the pier, and entered the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Every body I meet has something to say about my boat!\" said he to\r\nhimself. \"I don't wonder that the workmen refuse to patronize me, for\r\nshe is a rough-looking craft, that's a fact. If I couldn't swim like a\r\nduck, I should almost be afraid to get into her myself; for she looks\r\nas if she was just about to turn over. The water that runs in through\r\nthe bottom doesn't trouble me any, because I go barefooted; but, if\r\nI was rich, and could afford to wear fine boots, I believe I should\r\nhesitate about taking passage in a craft like this. I really begin to\r\nbelieve that it was more by good luck than good management, that I ever\r\nmade a cent with her. I must think up a plan to get a new boat; now,\r\nthat's settled.\"\r\n\r\nBob sculled slowly to the middle of the harbor, where he stopped and\r\nsat down in his scow to wait for a passenger. A short distance from him\r\nwas a steamer, which was just getting ready to start on her regular\r\ntrip to Boston. The first bell had been rung, and the gang-plank was\r\ncrowded with passengers who were hurrying on board, and with visitors,\r\nwho were making haste to get ashore. As the fisher-boy sat watching the\r\nsteamer, his oar idly dangling in the water, and his thoughts busy with\r\nthe question which, for the last three months, had been uppermost in\r\nhis mind, he happened to glance toward the opposite side of the harbor,\r\nand saw a gentleman walking uneasily up and down the wharf, stopping\r\nnow and then to wave his hat, to attract the attention of some of the\r\nferry-boys.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; comin', sir! Be there directly, sir!\" shouted a voice behind\r\nthe fisher-boy, which the latter knew belonged to Sam Barton. \"I'm\r\ncomin' like a steamboat, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of Sam's mouth, however, before he became\r\naware that his old rival was ready to contest the ownership of the\r\ntwo cents' passage money, which the gentleman was waiting to pay to\r\nthe boy who should carry him across the harbor; for Bob had jumped to\r\nhis feet, and was sending his clumsy scow through the water at a rate\r\nof speed that soon left Sam behind. The latter, however, never once\r\nthought of giving up the race, for he was one who tried to profit by\r\nhis experience. He had told the fisher-boy that he had learned that a\r\nnice, clean boat would go a long way toward securing custom, and he\r\nwas in hopes that when the passenger on the wharf saw his fine yawl,\r\ndrawn up along-side Bob's scow, he would do as others had done--take\r\npassage with him, and leave the fisher-boy to look elsewhere. This was\r\na favorite trick of Sam's, and by it he gained a great deal of custom.\r\n\r\n\"Jump in, sir!\" said Bob, as he ran the Go Ahead along-side the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Out o' the way, there, Bobby Jennings!\" shouted Sam. \"Here comes the\r\nboat the gentleman's been a waitin' for. He wants cushions to set down\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nBut the man's actions indicated that he had not been waiting for Sam\r\nBarton, for, without a moment's hesitation, he sprang down into Bob's\r\nscow, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a silver half-dollar if you will put me on board that\r\nsteamer before she leaves the wharf. Do your best, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not need any orders to \"do his best,\" after his\r\npassenger had promised him a half dollar for putting him on board the\r\nsteamer. He opened his eyes in astonishment at the mention of so large\r\na reward, and so did Sam Barton, who wondered that the gentleman should\r\nchoose a leaky, dirty craft, when he might just as well have had a\r\nclean, dry boat, with \"cushions to set down on.\"\r\n\r\nBob lost no time in pushing off from the wharf, and when he got fairly\r\nstarted, he sent the Go Ahead through the water in a way that made the\r\nferry-boys wonder. But the harbor was wide, and when the fisher-boy was\r\nhalf way across, the steamer's bell rang for the second time.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, boy!\" said the passenger, nervously. \"I must go out on that\r\nboat. Catch her, and I'll give you a dollar.\"\r\n\r\nBob drew in a long breath, shook off his hat, and redoubled his\r\nexertions at the oar, and, to his delight, he succeeded in running\r\nunder the stern of the steamer, and drawing up along-side the wharf,\r\njust as the last bell was ringing, and the order had been given to\r\nhaul in the gang-plank.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, boy,\" exclaimed the passenger. \"You are a capital\r\noarsman, and the next time I come to Newport and want a ferry-boy, I\r\nshall remember you.\" As he spoke, he thrust his hand into his pocket\r\nand pulled out some money, which he handed to Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for me!\" said the fisher-boy, \"my fortune is safe.\"\r\n\r\nBeing deeply interested in the success of his passenger, he did\r\nnot examine his fare, but stood with one hand holding the Go Ahead\r\nalong-side the wharf, and the other clutching the two pieces of money.\r\nHe saw the gentleman spring upon the gang-plank just as the sailors had\r\nbegun to haul it in. Reaching the steamer in safety, he turned and gave\r\nBob an approving nod, and then disappeared up the stairs that led to\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n\"He's all right,\" said the fisher-boy, wiping his forehead with his\r\nshirt sleeve, \"and so am I. If I could get a passenger like that every\r\nday, it wouldn't be long before I would go to sea.\"\r\n\r\nBob seated himself in the stern of his scow, panting hard after his\r\nlong race, and jingled the money in his closed hand. He had not yet\r\nlooked at it, but he knew that the gentleman had kept his promise, for\r\nhe could feel the two half-dollars with his fingers. He had not owned a\r\ngreat deal of money of that description, and he did not think he could\r\nbe deceived.\r\n\r\n\"How much did he give you, Bobby?\" inquired Sam Barton, pulling up\r\nalong-side the scow. \"A feller can't scare up a passenger like that\r\nevery day, an' I'm sorry I didn't beat you in the race.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not,\" said Bob, \"you don't know how much good this dollar will do\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"A dollar!\" exclaimed Sam. \"Did he give you a whole dollar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, two silver half-dollars. See there!\" said Bob, opening his\r\nhand. \"Don't they look--\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy suddenly paused, and gazed first at the money, and then\r\nat his companion, who stood with eyes and mouth open, the very picture\r\nof astonishment. Instead of two silver half-dollars, Bob held in his\r\nhand two twenty-dollar gold pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Bobby Jennings!\" exclaimed Sam, who was the first to recover from\r\nhis surprise, \"ain't me an' you the luckiest boys in Newport? I got a\r\nhundred dollars fur haulin' a feller out of the water, an' now you get\r\nforty dollars in gold, fur bringin' a passenger across the harbor. You\r\ncan throw away that ar ole scow now, Bobby, an' buy my skiff. I'll sell\r\nher to you fur twenty dollars, an' any body who has seed her, will tell\r\nyou that she's cheap at that. Is it a bargain?\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not answer; indeed, he did not seem to be aware that\r\nSam was speaking to him. He sat looking at the two bright pieces of\r\ngold, as if he had suddenly lost all power to turn his eyes from them.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Bobby, is it a bargain?\" repeated Sam.\r\n\r\nThis question seemed to bring the fisher-boy to his senses. He hastily\r\nput the money into his pocket, shoved the Go Ahead from the wharf,\r\nand catching up his oar, he started in hot pursuit of the steamer,\r\nwhich was now moving slowly down the harbor. He very soon discovered,\r\nhowever, that it was useless to think of overtaking her, and seeing\r\nhis passenger walking up and down the deck, he dropped his oar, and\r\nbegan to shout and swing his hat around his head to attract the man's\r\nattention. In this he was successful; for the passenger waved his hand\r\nin reply, as if he thought that Bob was congratulating him on reaching\r\nthe steamer in time.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" screamed the fisher-boy. \"Come back here, sir! You have paid\r\nme too much!\" and he pulled the money out of his pocket and held it\r\nup, as if he hoped that, even at that distance, the man could see and\r\nrecognize it. But the latter evidently could not be made to understand,\r\nfor he again waved his hand, and then resumed his walk; while Bob stood\r\nin his scow and watched the steamer as she rounded the pier, and shaped\r\nher course down the bay.\r\n\r\nSam Barton had watched all these movements in surprise. When he saw\r\nthat Bob was endeavoring to overtake the steamer, in order to return\r\nthe money which his passenger had paid to him by mistake, he caught up\r\nhis oar and followed after him, urging him to keep silent. If Bob heard\r\nhim, he did not heed his advice, for not until he became convinced that\r\nit was impossible to catch the steamer, or to make the man understand\r\nhim, did he cease to pull and shout with all his might.\r\n\r\n\"Bobby Jennings, have you gone clean crazy?\" demanded Sam, as he\r\nsculled up along-side the fisher-boy, who stood gazing after the\r\nsteamer, as if he hoped she might yet come back, and give him an\r\nopportunity to return the gold pieces. \"What do you want to give that\r\nar money back fur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it isn't mine,\" answered Bob.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't your'n!\" repeated Sam. \"I'd like to know what's the reason.\r\nDidn't that feller give it to you with his own hands? In course he\r\ndid; an' that's why it belongs to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he made a mistake,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"That's his own lookout, an' not your'n,\" returned Sam. \"Keep it, say\r\nnothin' to nobody, throw away that ar ole scow, an' buy my skiff. Then\r\nyou'll be well fixed, an' can begin to make money. That feller will\r\nnever miss it, 'cause when you see a man who carries twenty dollar\r\ngold-pieces loose in his pockets, these hard times, it's a sure sign\r\nthat he knows where to get more when they are gone. Where be you\r\ngoin'?\" he added, as the fisher-boy got out his oar, and sculled away\r\nfrom the spot.\r\n\r\n\"I am going home,\" was the answer. \"I am going to give this money to\r\nmother, before I lose it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, Bobby Jennings,\" exclaimed Sam, \"if ever I see a feller who\r\nwas clean crazy, I see one now. You'll always be a fisherman, you'll\r\nalways live in a little shantee on the beach, an' you don't deserve\r\nnothin' better. The world owes you a livin', an' the easier you make it\r\nthe smarter you be. You'll never have another chance like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that!\" replied Bob. \"I've always been honest, and I\r\nalways intend to be.\"\r\n\r\nSam could not stop longer to remonstrate, for he saw one of his\r\n\"regular customers\" standing on the wharf. He sculled off to attend to\r\nhim, muttering to himself: \"Never mind, Bobby Jennings! I want one of\r\nthem gold pieces, an' I'm bound to get it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFISHERTOWN IN COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the fisher-boy did not overhear Sam's threat;\r\nif he did he was not frightened from his purpose, for, true to his\r\ndetermination, he carried the money home, and gave it to his mother for\r\nsafe keeping.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman told me that he would come back to Newport,\" said Bob,\r\nwhen he had related his story, \"and that he would hunt me up when he\r\nwanted a ferry-boy; so I know that I shall have a chance to return the\r\nmoney to him. But I wish he hadn't made that mistake, mother. It will\r\nbe six o'clock before I can get back to the wharf, and I am almost\r\ncertain that I can't earn money enough to save my fifteen dollars. It\r\nis very hard to be poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is hard, sometimes,\" replied his mother; \"but dishonesty is\r\nworse than poverty.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the fisher-boy had seen the money put carefully away, he hurried\r\nback to his scow, and, pulled toward the harbor. When he arrived there,\r\nhe found that most of the workmen had already been ferried across, and\r\nhe secured only one solitary passenger, who, upon being placed safely\r\nupon the wharf, drew in a long breath and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I bless my lucky stars that I am on solid ground once more. A man had\r\nbetter take a few lessons in swimming, before he risks his life in a\r\ntub like that.\"\r\n\r\nBob received his two cents' passage money without making any reply,\r\nand then sculled slowly toward the place where the ferry-boys had\r\ncongregated, to count their cash, and compare notes. He was the most\r\nunfortunate one among them. Sam Barton was feeling very jubilant over\r\na dollar and a half he had earned since morning; and the smallest\r\nboy in the harbor was proudly exhibiting forty cents to his admiring\r\ncompanions--the proceeds of his day's work.\r\n\r\n\"How much have you got, Bobby?\" called one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"I had only one passenger to-night,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Serves you jest right!\" exclaimed Sam Barton. \"I sha'n't feel the\r\nleast bit sorry fur you, if you never get another customer. A chap who\r\nwill throw away such a chance as you had to-day, hadn't ought to make\r\nany money. He took a feller across the harbor,\" added Sam, turning to\r\nhis companions, \"an' got forty dollars in gold fur it. He might jest as\r\nwell have kept the money as not; but he had to take it home and give it\r\nto his mother! Never mind, Bobby Jennings! I'll be even with you one of\r\nthese days.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be even with me!\" repeated the fisher-boy. \"What have I done to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had oughter give me one of them pieces of gold for my skiff,\"\r\nreturned Sam; \"but you didn't do it. I'll pay you off for that. I'll\r\ntake every passenger away from you that I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that. The harbor is as free to you as it is to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll buy my skiff,\" continued Sam, \"I'll let you alone. If I see\r\nyou goin' fur a customer, I won't trouble you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't buy your boat, because I havn't got the money. Those gold\r\npieces do not belong to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do, too!\" exclaimed Sam. \"That's only an excuse of your'n for\r\nkeepin' 'em. If you don't pay me twenty dollars fur my skiff, you\r\nsha'n't run any craft on this yere harbor.\"\r\n\r\nBob was a good deal astonished at this declaration, but he made no\r\nreply, for Sam was a bully, and he did not wish to irritate him. As\r\nto running any boat besides Sam's skiff on the harbor, the fisher-boy\r\nthought he should do as he pleased about that, although he knew that,\r\nif his rival chose to do so, he could make him a great deal of trouble.\r\nIf the forty dollars in gold had belonged to him, he would gladly have\r\ngiven half of it for the skiff; but the money had been paid to him by\r\nmistake, and he had no right to use it.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Bobby Jennings?\" demanded Sam, as he picked up his\r\noar and sculled slowly away from the spot. \"I'll give you one more\r\nchance, an' if you don't make a bargain with me, you'll always be sorry\r\nfor it. I am listenin' with all the ears I've got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you are,\" exclaimed the fisher-boy, springing up in his scow,\r\nand extending his hand toward Sam, as if to give more emphasis to\r\nhis words, \"you can hear me repeat what I have already said to you a\r\nhalf-a-dozen times, that I have no right to touch that money, and I'm\r\nnot going to do it. I've always been honest, and I always intend to be;\r\nso, you'll have to look somewhere else for a customer. I hope I have\r\nspoken plainly enough this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Sam. \"If you ever git rich by actin' the dunce\r\nthat ar way, jest let me know it. Let's go home, fellers.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not feel called upon to make any reply to these\r\nremarks. He got out his oar and followed slowly after his companions,\r\nwondering how a boy could be so unreasonable as Sam had shown himself\r\nto be, and trying his best to determine what the bully would decide to\r\ndo in the matter. Being well acquainted with him, Bob knew that he was\r\nnot above doing a mean action, and he was afraid that, assisted by some\r\nof his particular friends, he might attempt to take revenge on him.\r\n\r\nSam had every thing pretty much his own way in the harbor. Besides\r\nbeing a great fighting character, ready, at a moment's warning, to\r\nthrash any of the ferry-boys who acted contrary to his desires, he was\r\nan excellent oarsman, and any boy against whom he cherished a grudge\r\nfound it up-hill work to make ferrying a paying business. On the other\r\nhand, his particular friends always secured plenty of customers. If Sam\r\nsaw a passenger standing upon the wharf, instead of attending to his\r\nwants himself, he would say to one of his companions: \"There's a chance\r\nfur you to make some money. Be lively, now, an' I'll see that nobody\r\ntroubles, you;\" and in this way, when the bully felt particularly\r\ngood-natured and generous, he could put coppers into the pockets of any\r\nof the ferry-boys. Bob Jennings very seldom received any such favors at\r\nSam's hands. Indeed, from some cause or another, he was not a favorite\r\nin Fishertown. The ferry-boys, as a general thing, were a \"hard set,\"\r\nand Bob's feelings and aspirations were so different from theirs, that\r\nhe did not care to associate with them any more than was necessary.\r\nThis led the ferry-boys to believe that he thought himself better\r\nthan they were--that he was very much \"stuck-up,\" and that he needed\r\n\"bringing down a peg or two.\" More than that, the fisher-boy did not\r\nbelieve in the principles which Sam pumped into him at every possible\r\nopportunity. He had had several stormy debates with the bully, on these\r\npoints, and he had always been beaten. Sam could talk faster than Bob,\r\nand, besides, he always had ready an unanswerable argument. \"Bobby\r\nJennings,\" the bully would say, \"look at you, an' then look at me. You\r\nbelieve that a feller hadn't oughter take any thing that he don't make\r\nby hard work, while I say that he had oughter use his wits, an' make\r\nhis livin' the easiest way he can; an' the easier he makes it, the\r\nsmarter he is. Now, who's the best off in the world? You've got only\r\nthat leaky ole scow, that I wouldn't give fifteen cents fur, an' I own\r\nthis yawl, which is painted up nice, and furnished with cushions fur my\r\npassengers to set down on. It's worth every cent of sixty dollars. Then\r\nI've got a skiff worth twenty dollars more. Now, who's the richest man?\r\nI am, in course; an' that's what comes of bein' sharp.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not know how to answer this argument, but still his\r\nfaith in the old saying, which he had so often heard repeated by his\r\nmother--that \"Honesty is the best policy\"--was not shaken. He knew\r\nthat, with Sam, being \"sharp\" meant being dishonest. It meant slipping\r\naround in a boat, of a dark night, and picking up any little thing that\r\nhappened to be lying on the wharf, such as lumber, pieces of cordage,\r\nbits of iron, and even articles of freight, if any were exposed. That\r\nwas what Sam meant by \"being sharp;\" but Bob, who had been taught to\r\ncall things by their right names, pronounced it stealing. This, of\r\ncourse, made the bully very angry, and it was one reason why he so\r\ncordially disliked the fisher-boy. The latter, however, could get along\r\nvery well without any assistance from Sam Barton. He had established\r\na reputation, and he determined to render himself worthy of it. If he\r\ntold one of his customers that a fish weighed five pounds exactly, and\r\nthat it was fresh, the man never stopped to inquire: \"Are you sure that\r\nyou are not trying to cheat me, now?\" but paid his money, took his\r\nfish, and went away satisfied. If there was any thing Bob was proud of,\r\nbesides his skill as an oarsman, it was this reputation for honesty.\r\nHis companions might make sport of his boat, or call him a ragamuffin,\r\nand he would bear it all good-naturedly, but let one of them hint that\r\nhe was a poor boatman, or that he was not as honest as he ought to be,\r\nand the fisher-boy was aroused in an instant. This was the reason he\r\nhad spoken so sharply to Sam, when the latter proposed that Bob should\r\nbuy his skiff. He was angry; and he was troubled, too--not by the\r\nthreats the bully had made, but by the thought that Sam Barton, or any\r\none else, should, for an instant, have believed him mean enough to make\r\nuse of the money which had come into his possession by accident.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Bob to himself, \"I won't do it. My motto hits this case\r\nexactly; and I'll stick to it, if I never get a better boat than this\r\nold scow.\"\r\n\r\nSam Barton was troubled also; but his feelings were very different\r\nfrom Bob's. He was angry with the fisher-boy because he had refused\r\nto give him one of the twenty-dollar gold pieces for his skiff, and,\r\nhaving promised to \"get even\" with him, he was thinking how he should\r\ngo to work to put his threat into execution. By the time he reached\r\nhome, he had decided upon a course of action, and when he had run the\r\nbow of his yawl upon the beach, and the fisher-boy had passed on out\r\nof hearing, he intimated to his companions that he had something very\r\nimportant to say to them. As soon as their boats had been secured, the\r\nferry-boys gathered about their leader and waited for him to speak.\r\nThey were a rough-looking set of fellows--ragged and dirty, barefooted\r\nand sunburned--and if Bob could have seen them at that moment, it\r\nmight have induced the belief that Sam was really in earnest when he\r\nthreatened to be revenged upon him.\r\n\r\n\"That ar Bobby Jennings has played me a mean trick,\" said the bully,\r\n\"an' I jest aint a-goin' to stand it: he's goin' to give back them gold\r\npieces as soon as he sees that man ag'in, when he knows all the while\r\nthat I want to sell him my skiff. Now, aint that a mean trick, boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"In course!\" answered all the boys at once; but it is difficult to\r\nsee how they reached this conclusion, unless it was because they were\r\nafraid of Sam.\r\n\r\n\"So do I call it a mean trick,\" continued the latter, shaking his fists\r\nin the air, and growing angrier every moment. \"I say that ar Bobby\r\nJennings is the meanest feller on this ere beach. He's so stuck up that\r\nhe won't go round with us of nights, an' we aint a-goin' to let no\r\nfeller stay here who thinks himself better than we be. We're goin' to\r\nrun him away from here, now; we'll make Fishertown too hot to hold him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will we do it?\" asked one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Easy enough. In the first place, I want all you fellers to watch him,\r\nan' take every passenger, away from him that you can. Don't let him\r\ntake a man across the harbor from this time on. In the next place, that\r\nole scow of his'n is the only thing he's got to make a livin' with, an'\r\nsome dark night we'll slip up to his shantee, run her out into the bay,\r\nan' sink her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he'll get another, somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's jest what I want him to do. Can't you see through a ladder? He\r\ncan't live without a boat, no more'n he could live without his head,\r\nand when he finds that his ole scow is gone, mebbe he'll buy my skiff.\r\nIf he does, we'll let him alone. Remember, now: watch him close, an'\r\ntake all his passengers.\"\r\n\r\nSam, having nothing further to say just then, dismissed his companions,\r\nwho walked off threatening vengeance against the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTOM NEWCOMBE'S PLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bob arrived within sight of his home, he saw a boy standing on the\r\nbeach waiting for him. It was none other than our old acquaintance Tom\r\nNewcombe, who, as it afterward proved, had found \"another idea,\" and\r\nhad come down to reveal it to the fisher-boy, and to ask his assistance\r\nin carrying it out.\r\n\r\nTom had remained at the military academy until the close of the term;\r\nnot because he wished to do so, but for the reason that he could not\r\nhelp himself, and was not given another opportunity to take \"French\r\nleave.\" During these five months he had not improved in any particular.\r\nOn the contrary, he seemed to have gone down hill very rapidly in the\r\nestimation of his companions, for, when he came out of the academy,\r\nhe found, to his astonishment and indignation, that every one of his\r\nfriends had deserted him; that the organization of which he had so\r\nlong been the honored chief had ceased to exist, and that another\r\nsociety had been formed, with new signs and passwords. The office of\r\ngrand commander of the council had been abolished, and when Tom made\r\napplication to join the new society, he was rejected without ceremony.\r\nThe reason for this was, that when questioned during the court-martial\r\nthat had been held at the academy, the grand commander, forgetting all\r\nthe solemn promises he had made not to reveal any of the society's\r\nsecrets, had exposed every thing, and thus broken up the organization\r\nof Night-hawks. This fact had come to the ears of the village boys, and\r\nthey were very angry about it.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you answer them, Tom?\" asked Johnny Harding, indignantly. \"You\r\nhave broken up the best society that ever existed in this village!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I couldn't help it,\" drawled Tom. (He still held to his old,\r\nlazy way of talking.) \"If I hadn't answered them, the colonel would\r\nhave shut me up in the guard-house, and fed me on bread and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference,\" said Johnny. \"I would have stayed in the\r\nguard-house until I was gray-headed, before I would have broken my\r\npromises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then some one else would have told him,\" whined Tom. \"There were\r\nthirteen other fellows up before the court-martial.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference either. Your business was to hold your\r\ntongue, but you didn't do it. You can't be trusted, Newcombe, that's\r\neasy enough to be seen, and for that reason, it would not be safe for\r\nus to admit you into our new society. We don't want traitors among us.\"\r\n\r\nTom urged and plead in vain. The boys were firm in their determination\r\nthat the rules should not be suspended, even in the case of the son of\r\nthe richest man in Newport, and the grand commander finally left them\r\nin disgust, mentally resolving that he would never speak to them again\r\nas long as he lived.\r\n\r\n\"I'll study up a plan to fix them for that,\" said he, to himself. \"The\r\nfirst thing those fellows know, I'll start a society of my own; and\r\nevery time I catch one of them in my end of the village, I'll see that\r\nhe don't get off without a good beating.\"\r\n\r\nTom had so long been allowed to hold prominent positions among his\r\ncompanions, that the idea that they could get along without him had\r\nnever once entered his head. He believed that in a few days the boys\r\nwould see how necessary he was to them, and that then they would think\r\nbetter of their decision, receive him into their new society, and\r\nbestow upon him an office equal in rank to the one he had held among\r\nthe Night-hawks.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they should want to make 'Squire Thompson another present,\"\r\nsoliloquized Tom, \"who would pull the wagon out of the barn-yard, and\r\ngo into the pasture to catch the horse? Or, what if some of them should\r\ntake it into their heads to go to sea on their own hook! Is there one\r\namong them who could manage affairs as nicely as I did, when we academy\r\nfellows run away in the Swallow? I was the strongest and bravest boy in\r\nthat society, and we'll see how they will get along without me. They\r\nwill be after me in a few days.\"\r\n\r\nBut, contrary to his expectations, two weeks had passed away without\r\nbringing any overtures from the boys, and during this time Tom had\r\nbeen as miserable as can well be imagined. When he left the academy,\r\nhis father had taken him into the office, so that he might have him\r\nalways under his eye; and, at first, this arrangement had pleased Tom\r\nexceedingly. He was free from the strict discipline of the military\r\nschool; there was no orderly sergeant to keep an eye on all his\r\nmovements; no boy officers to trouble him; no teacher to scold him\r\nfor inattention to his duties; and during his first day's experience\r\nin the office, Tom thought it was just the place for him. He suddenly\r\ntook it into his head that he would like to be a commission merchant.\r\nHe resolved that he would pay strict attention to his work, so that\r\nin a few weeks he would be promoted to book-keeper. Then his troubles\r\nwould all be over. He would have nothing to do but stand at his desk\r\nall day, and that was the easiest work in the world. At the end of the\r\nsecond day, however, Tom began to take less interest in his duties,\r\nand before a week had passed away, he had become thoroughly disgusted\r\nwith his situation. He heartily wished himself at the military academy,\r\nat sea, on a farm with Mr. Hayes and his big boys--in fact, anywhere\r\nin the world, rather than in his father's office. He was obliged to\r\nbuild fires and run errands--two things that he did not like to do.\r\nTom thought he could not live long if he was required to do such\r\nwork, and he straightway came to the determination to get out of the\r\noffice as soon as possible. In order to accomplish his object, it\r\nwas necessary that he should decide upon some other business; and he\r\nfinally resolved to try his hand at trading again. The question then\r\narose, How should he get a suitable vessel? He intended to go into\r\nbusiness on a grand scale this time, and he wanted a boat exactly like\r\nthe Swallow, which would cost him two or three hundred dollars. Then he\r\nwould want at least a hundred dollars more to invest in produce. Tom\r\nknew that it would take him a long time to save so much money, for his\r\nwages amounted to only five dollars a week, and the forty-eight dollars\r\nhe had earned by his voyage in the Savannah had slipped through his\r\nfingers, one by one, until he had not a cent remaining. But he had\r\nthought the matter over thoroughly, and he had come to the conclusion\r\nthat if he only \"kept his eyes open,\" he could make money besides his\r\nwages. Tom was busy for several days turning this matter over in his\r\nmind, and so completely wrapped up was he in his financial schemes\r\nthat he had no time to waste in studying up a plan to revenge himself\r\non the Night-hawks, and but very little to devote to his duties in\r\nthe office. To the no small astonishment of his father, he spent the\r\ngreater portion of each day in poring over the columns of newspapers;\r\nand so interested did he appear to be in them, that the merchant began\r\nto be encouraged. But Tom was not looking for news; he was reading\r\nthe advertisements; and one day he was seen to cut out a piece of a\r\nnewspaper and put it carefully away in his pocket. What it was no one\r\nknew or cared to ask; but all the clerks in the office noticed that,\r\nfrom that day, Tom was one of the happiest fellows they had ever seen.\r\nThe secret was, he imagined that he had at last discovered the very\r\nthing he had been looking for so long--the road to fortune. It was\r\nsomething that has deceived more than one grown person, but still a\r\nsensible boy of fifteen ought not to have paid any attention to it. But\r\nthen, Tom was different from almost any body else, and those who were\r\nacquainted with him were not surprised at any thing he did. It gave him\r\nsomething to think about, and when he had got his plans all matured he\r\npaid a visit to Fishertown, for the purpose of laying the matter before\r\nBob Jennings.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" he exclaimed, as the fisher-boy ran the bow of his scow\r\nupon the beach, \"come ashore, quick. I've got something to tell you\r\nthat will make you open your eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you come with me, and I'll tell you. It's too good for every\r\nbody to hear.\"\r\n\r\nBob made the Go Ahead fast to the wharf and followed Tom, who walked\r\ndown the beach until he was certain that there was no possible chance\r\nof his being overheard, when he stopped, and said in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Bob Jennings, our fortune's made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our fortune!\" echoed the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so loud! Yes, sir, _our_ fortune--yours and mine. I came\r\ndown here to-night to see if I could engage you to ship as first mate\r\nof the Storm King.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Storm King!\" repeated Bob. \"What boat is that? I have never heard\r\nof her before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you haven't,\" said Tom, mysteriously, \"but you'll hear a great\r\ndeal about her before you are many weeks older: you'll hear that she is\r\nthe prettiest little vessel that ever sailed out of Newport harbor, and\r\nthat she can beat any thing in the shape of a sloop that was ever put\r\ntogether. It is the name of a vessel I am going to build in less than a\r\nmonth. She is to be exactly the size and model of the Swallow, only I\r\nshall have her cabin fitted up more expensively. Can I engage you, Bob?\r\nI'll give you a dollar a day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy hardly knew what reply to make to this proposition, for\r\nhe was, at first, inclined to believe that Tom had got another wild\r\nscheme into his head, which would end in smoke, like all the rest of\r\nhis bright ideas. But the latter seemed to understand his subject so\r\nwell, and spoke with such confidence, that, after reflecting a little,\r\nBob began to think that perhaps Mr. Newcombe had promised to assist his\r\nson in carrying out his new plan.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure that you are going to get this boat?\" inquired the\r\nfisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"I am just as certain of it as I am that I am now standing on this\r\nbeach,\" replied Tom, emphatically. \"I know as well as you do, Bob, that\r\na good many of my calculations have been knocked in the head, but this\r\none can't fail. I know I have hit the right thing at last; all I ask is\r\na little assistance from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your father going to give you the vessel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's the best part of the whole business! No, sir! he's not\r\ngoing to give me the boat. I'm not going to him for a red cent. I know\r\nright where I can get more money than I would dare ask him for. Just\r\nlook here!\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom said this, he pulled out his pocket-book, and after glancing\r\nup and down the beach, to make sure that no one was observing\r\nhis movements, he produced a piece of paper and handed it to the\r\nfisher-boy. It proved to be a newspaper advertisement, and read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n \"For a Fortune, write to\r\n\r\n  \"E. H. HARRIS & CO.,\r\n\r\n  \"_Baltimore, Md._\"\r\n\r\nBob read these mysterious words over several times, but failed to\r\nunderstand them. \"I don't exactly see through it,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\" exclaimed Tom. \"Well, I do. It's simple enough: it means\r\nthat if you want to make a rich man of yourself, all you have to\r\ndo is to write to those gentlemen in Baltimore. I answered their\r\nadvertisement, and see here what they sent me in reply.\"\r\n\r\nTom again looked up and down the beach--for he was very much afraid\r\nthat some one might approach them unobserved, and thus gain a knowledge\r\nof his secret--and then produced a letter from his pocket-book. It\r\nmust have contained some very valuable information, for, as he slowly\r\nunfolded it, he became so excited that he could scarcely stand still.\r\n\r\n\"Just think of it, Bob!\" he exclaimed, in a suppressed whisper: \"here\r\nwe are, two boys, only fifteen years' old, and rich already. We have\r\nmade it all ourselves, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"_We!_\" repeated the fisher-boy, in surprise. \"Am I rich?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are! You'll bear half the expenses, and I'll divide the\r\nprofits with you.\"\r\n\r\nBob shook his head. \"If there are any expenses about it,\" said he,\r\n\"you might as well count me out. Fifteen dollars are all I have in the\r\nworld. I've worked hard for that, and I can't spend it foolishly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, just look here, Bob!\" said Tom, placing his hands behind him, and\r\nturning his head on one side, as he had often seen his father do when\r\narguing with a person, \"who asked you to spend your money foolishly?\r\nYou'll never make a business man in the world, if you act this way.\r\nYou have never worked in a commission office, but I have, and I ought\r\nto know something. If you were certain that, by investing five of your\r\nfifteen dollars, you could make--make--let me see! A half of five\r\nthousand is how much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five hundred,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you knew that, by risking five dollars, you could make two\r\nthousand five hundred in less than two weeks, would you hesitate to do\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't, if it was honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, it's perfectly honest! In this letter I am promised five thousand\r\ndollars, if I will assist these men in Baltimore in extending their\r\nbusiness. Listen to this:\" and Tom straightened himself up and read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"'Our doubts are traitors,\r\n    And make us lose the good we oft would win,\r\n    By fearing to attempt.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That means,\" he added, seeing that the fisher-boy did not quite\r\nunderstand it, \"that we ought not to pay any attention to our doubts;\r\nthat if we don't risk any thing, we certainly will never gain any\r\nthing. I have often heard my father say so, and it's my opinion\r\nexactly. Now here's what they say in the letter. Listen with all your\r\nears, Bob, for it will astonish you:\"\r\n\r\n [CONFIDENTIAL.]\r\n\r\n  BALTIMORE, MD., May 31, 18--.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR: Being desirous of increasing our business in your part of\r\n the country, we have decided that you are a proper person to act as\r\n our agent. We are the managers of the Maryland Lottery--an institution\r\n known all over the United States and Europe as being the most reliable\r\n one in existence. It is authorized by the State, and incorporated by\r\n special act of Congress, and its patrons are to be found in every\r\n civilized country on the globe. Of course, with such an immense\r\n business, we require a multitude of agents, and, in order to secure\r\n your services, we make you the following proposition:\r\n\r\n On receipt of ten dollars, we will send you a package of tickets,\r\n which we will guarantee to draw one of the capital prizes in our\r\n splendid scheme. When you remit the money, please state whether or\r\n not you are willing to act as our agent, and we will send you the\r\n tickets by return mail. When you receive the prize, all we ask of you\r\n is to show it to your friends and acquaintances, and tell them that\r\n you drew it at our office. We will select the lucky package for you,\r\n and we faithfully promise you that, if it does not draw a prize of\r\n FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, over and above all expenses, we will give you\r\n a package of tickets in one of our magnificent special lotteries for\r\n nothing.\r\n\r\n We can afford to make you this generous offer, because we shall all\r\n gain by it: you will be benefited by receiving a nice little fortune,\r\n while our business will be greatly increased by the extra amount\r\n of orders for tickets which we shall expect to receive from your\r\n neighborhood.\r\n\r\n We venture the assertion that this is the best offer you ever\r\n received, and that you will never have another like it as long as you\r\n live. Remember that\r\n\r\n  \"There is a tide in the affairs of men\r\n   Which, if taken at the flood,\r\n   Leads on to fortune.\"\r\n\r\n We have made it a rule never to take notice of any communications,\r\n unless the necessary amount is inclosed; so send on the ten dollars,\r\n and we will forward you the tickets at once.\r\n\r\n Bear in mind that this offer is made to you confidentially.\r\n\r\n  Your friends and well-wishers,\r\n\r\n  E. H. HARRIS & CO.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed Tom, when he had finished reading this precious\r\ndocument, \"isn't that a splendid offer?\"\r\n\r\nNow, Bob had never heard of a lottery before, and he did not know that\r\nthere are men in the world who, being too lazy to work for a living,\r\nfind employment in sending letters of this description all over the\r\ncountry, without the least intention of answering any they receive in\r\nreply. He did not know that this \"honest business\" was a swindle, and\r\nthat his friend Tom was not the first, and probably will not be the\r\nlast, who has been deceived by just such \"generous offers!\" He had not\r\nyet learned that Tom carried bad luck with him wherever he went, and\r\nthat any one who listened to his propositions was certain to get into\r\ntrouble sooner or later. If he had known all these things, and had\r\nbeen able to look far enough into the future to see what would be the\r\nresult of Tom's new idea, he would not have been long in deciding what\r\nanswer to give him. To tell the truth, he was greatly interested in\r\nthis splendid scheme; but he was quick-witted, and, after thinking the\r\nmatter over for a moment, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what to do! Suppose you write to those men, telling them\r\nto select the lucky package for you, and that if it draws a prize,\r\nthey can keep their ten dollars out of it, and send you the remainder.\r\nIn that way you will stand just as good a chance of drawing the five\r\nthousand dollars as you do now; and besides, you will not risk any of\r\nyour own money.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, that's no way to do business!\" drawled Tom. \"Don't you see\r\nthat they have made it a rule never to take notice of any letters\r\nunless they contain money?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not run any risk,\" replied Bob, \"for the cash is in their\r\nown hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's against their rules,\" said Tom, emphatically; \"and even if it\r\nwasn't I would not ask them to do that, for it would look as though I\r\nwas afraid to trust them. Don't you see what they say about 'our doubts\r\nbeing traitors?' Now, Bob, I want to know if you will go into this\r\nbusiness with me? I've got just five dollars of my own, and if you will\r\nadvance the rest I'll divide the profits with you. Besides, I'll give\r\nyou a dollar a day to ship as mate of the Storm King.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want that job if I had twenty-five hundred dollars,\" said\r\nthe fisher-boy; \"I would go to sea in less than a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's another reason why you ought to give me five dollars to\r\nsend on with mine. It will make a rich man of you, and you can begin\r\nthe life of a sailor at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I use any of my money I want to buy a skiff with it. I need one\r\nbadly.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, go in debt for it,\" said Tom. \"Go to Mr. Graves, the boat-builder,\r\ntell him that you want a nice little skiff, the finest one he has on\r\nhand, and that you will pay him for it in one month. You may safely do\r\nthat, for in less than a week you will be rich enough to buy out his\r\nwhole ship-yard.\"\r\n\r\nThis was something entirely new to the fisher-boy. He had never thought\r\nof such a thing before, and, perhaps, the reason was because he had\r\nnever dreamed that there was a single person in the village who would\r\nbe willing to trust him. He saw in an instant--or rather, _imagined_\r\nhe saw--that if he could induce Mr. Graves to give him one of his\r\nfine skiffs on his promise to pay for it in one month, it would be an\r\nimmense advantage to him.\r\n\r\n\"There's no harm in it,\" said Tom, seeing that the fisher-boy\r\nhesitated. \"It is done every day, right here in Newport, by our best\r\nbusiness men. My father does it, so it can't be wrong.\"\r\n\r\nBob thought so too. Mr. Newcombe was a great man in his estimation,\r\nand he might safely follow in his lead.\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued for half an hour longer, Tom laboring\r\nfaithfully to convince the fisher-boy that, if he assisted him in his\r\ngrand scheme, he would be rich in a very short space of time, and he\r\nfinally carried his point; for Bob was deeply impressed, more by Tom's\r\neloquence than by any thing else, and he promised to think the matter\r\nover, and to be ready with his answer on the following evening. Tom,\r\nas usual, was impatient to begin operations at once; but he was afraid\r\nto urge the matter, and he finally took leave of the fisher-boy, after\r\nobliging him to promise, over and over again, that he would keep all\r\nthat had passed between them a profound secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSAM BARTON'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy slept very little that night. He was thinking of\r\nTom's new plan, and the more he turned the matter over in his mind,\r\nthe nearer he came to a determination to give a favorable answer on\r\nthe following evening. He was deeply interested in the lottery, and\r\nremembering how confidently Tom had spoken of his success, he could not\r\nhelp giving full sway to his fancy, and picturing to himself a host of\r\npleasant things that would happen when he should come into possession\r\nof his share of the prize. In the first place, their humble cabin\r\non the beach could be exchanged for a nice little cottage in a more\r\nrespectable part of the village; he could turn the Go Ahead adrift in\r\nthe harbor, and buy a nice little schooner, like the one he had met on\r\nhis voyage home from his fishing-grounds; he and his brothers could\r\nthrow away their ragged clothes, and dress as well as any boys in the\r\nvillage; and, after all these things had been done, there would still\r\nbe enough left to support the family in fine style while he was at sea.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, Bob's imagination ran wild with him,\r\nand he became so excited that he could not lie still. There was only\r\none obstacle in his way that he could discover, but that was one\r\nthat could not be easily got over. He had always been in the habit\r\nof giving every cent he earned to his mother for safe keeping, and\r\nhe did not know how to go to work to get the five dollars to invest\r\nin the lottery. If he asked his mother for the money, she would, no\r\ndoubt, want to know what use he intended to make of it; and that was a\r\nquestion that Bob would not have cared to answer. This ought to have\r\nbeen sufficient to convince him that Tom's scheme was not altogether\r\nright, and that he ought to have nothing whatever to do with it. But\r\nthe fisher-boy did not think of that. He had been carried away by Tom's\r\narguments, and it was very easy for him to believe that, even if he\r\nwas obliged to make use of a little deception in order to secure his\r\ntwenty-five hundred dollars, there would be no harm in it.\r\n\r\nBob arose the next morning at six o'clock, unrefreshed, and as sleepy\r\nas when he went to bed the night before. After a hasty breakfast he\r\nstarted for the harbor, and taking up a position opposite to his pier,\r\nhe sat down in his boat to wait for a passenger. The Go Ahead was\r\ncomparatively dry; for, during the previous evening, the fisher-boy\r\nhad hauled her out upon the beach and carefully caulked all the seams\r\nand cracks, and he hoped that her improved appearance would enable\r\nhim to secure one or two extra passengers. Of course Tom's scheme was\r\nstill uppermost in his mind, and, as he sat in his scow thinking it\r\nover, he happened to cast his eye toward the upper end of the harbor,\r\nand saw Sam Barton and several of his particular friends in their\r\nboats, holding a consultation. Presently they separated and took up\r\ntheir positions near the middle of the harbor, Sam and two other good\r\noarsmen stationing themselves near the fisher-boy. Bob understood the\r\nmeaning of all these movements, for he had often seen the same thing\r\ndone before, when Sam happened to get into a quarrel with any of the\r\nferry-boys. He knew that if he wished to earn any money that morning he\r\nmust work hard for it; for it was the bully's intention to prevent him\r\nfrom taking any passengers across the harbor. The fisher-boy, however,\r\nwas not at all alarmed. Pulling off his hat, he put it carefully away\r\nunder one of the thwarts, rolled up his sleeves, and standing up in his\r\nboat, kept a firm hold of his oar.\r\n\r\n\"You're goin' to fight for it, are you, Bobby Jennings?\" asked Sam, who\r\nhad observed all these movements. \"Better look out!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am looking out,\" replied the fisher-boy. \"I am keeping my eyes open\r\nfor passengers, and I'm going to get as many as I can. You may depend\r\nupon that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll bet you a dollar that all the customers you'll get this\r\nmornin' won't make you rich,\" returned Sam. \"An' now look a-here, Bobby\r\nJennings! we've seed you in this harbor often enough; we don't want you\r\nhere; and, if you would get out of Fishertown by sunset, you would make\r\nus mighty glad----Yes, sir; comin', sir!\"\r\n\r\nBut Sam, as usual, was just a minute too late. As was generally the\r\ncase, Bob's scow made good her name, for she went ahead of the bully's\r\nfine yawl very easily; and then began a most exciting race, which\r\nwas witnessed by three men who were waiting to be carried across the\r\nharbor. In obedience to the instructions they had received the evening\r\nbefore, every ferry-boy who believed he stood the least chance of\r\nreaching the wharf first started for the passengers, each of them\r\nintent on \"cutting out that ar Bobby Jennings.\" A single glance showed\r\nthe fisher-boy the state of affairs, and, although his chances for\r\nwinning were very poor indeed, as some of the boats were nearer to the\r\nwharf than his own, he bent to his oar with the determination to beat\r\nthem all, and to show the bully and his friends that, if they intended\r\nto drive him off the harbor by taking his passengers away from him,\r\nthey had something of a task before them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the boats were very soon overtaken and left behind, and\r\nthen the contest was between Bob and his old rival. Both had resolved\r\nto win, and the men who were standing upon the wharf began to get\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n\"Half a dollar to the boy who reaches the wharf first!\" shouted one of\r\nthem, putting his hand into his pocket. \"Give way strong, you little\r\nfellow in that clumsy scow.\"\r\n\r\nBob heard the words of encouragement, and from that moment he believed\r\nthe race was his. The men on the wharf sympathized with him, and wanted\r\nhim to win, and he was bound to do it. It was of no use for Sam to\r\nredouble his efforts, for the Go Ahead left him behind so rapidly that\r\nit seemed as if the fisher-boy had only been playing with him thus far,\r\nand was now going to show him how badly he could beat him. He did not\r\nreach the wharf until Bob was about to shove off with his passengers,\r\nand then he came up with his usual cry:\r\n\r\n\"Here's the boat you've been a-waitin fur; you want cushions to set\r\ndown on.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't,\" replied one of the men; \"we're goin' to take passage\r\nwith the best oarsman in the harbor. Clear the track with that old tub\r\nof yours! Here's your half a dollar, boy,\" he added, handing the money\r\nto Bob, and patting him on the back.\r\n\r\nBefore the fisher-boy put his fare into his pocket, he could not help\r\nholding it up to the view of Sam and the rest of his rivals, who stood\r\nup in their boats wiping their faces and foaming with rage. Sam made\r\nno remark, but he shook his head threateningly, and Bob knew that the\r\nmatter was far from being settled. This did not trouble him, however,\r\nfor he was an independent sort of a fellow, and the bully was a boy\r\nwhose friendship he cared nothing about. Besides, he thought that,\r\nif Sam was foolish enough to get angry because he had been beaten in\r\na fair race, he might take his own time to get pleased again. The\r\nfisher-boy landed his passengers safely upon the opposite wharf, and,\r\nas he pulled toward the middle of the harbor again, he saw that Sam and\r\nhis friends were holding another consultation. The bully was shaking\r\nhis fists in the air and talking loudly, and Bob was almost certain\r\nthat they would change their tactics, and attempt to gratify their\r\nrevenge by giving him a good beating, and treating him to a bath in the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\n\"I shall call it a mean trick, if they try to thrash me,\" said Bob,\r\npulling his oar out of the water and balancing it in his hand. \"This\r\npiece of hickory is pretty tough, and, if they pitch into me, I think\r\nthey will find that I am about as hard to whip as any boy they have got\r\nhold of lately.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy, knowing that he had as much right in the harbor as\r\nany one, had determined to stand his ground as long as possible; but,\r\nwith all his courage and confidence in his ability to beat his rivals\r\nat their own game, he could not help feeling a little anxiety when he\r\nthought what might be the result of this second council of war. He was\r\nvery much relieved to see that, when the meeting broke up, they did\r\nnot advance toward him in a body, as he had expected they would, but\r\nquietly took up their stations as before.\r\n\r\nAt length, half a dozen ship-carpenters appeared upon the wharf,\r\nand, in an instant, the ferry-boats were in motion. In spite of all\r\nthey could do to prevent it, Bob again took the lead, and a short\r\ndistance behind him came Sam Barton, shaking his head and muttering to\r\nhimself, and moving his oar viciously about in the water, as if he had\r\ndetermined to vent all his spite upon it. Bob reached the wharf first,\r\nand, flushed with excitement, and proud of his second triumph over\r\nthe bully, turned to look at Sam. He saw the latter give one glance\r\nover his shoulder, and then come on like the wind--the sharp bow of\r\nhis heavy yawl cutting the water like a knife. In an instant, Bob's\r\nexultant smile gave way to a look of astonishment and alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, there!\" he shouted, with all the strength of his lungs;\r\n\"you'll run me down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the way, there, Bobby Jennings,\" yelled Sam, never once\r\nslackening his speed or turning from his course; \"here comes the boat\r\nthe gentlemen's seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheer off, there, Sam Barton!\" shouted the fisher-boy again, seizing\r\nhis oar and attempting to scull his boat out of the way. But it was too\r\nlate; the yawl came on with all the speed the bully's practiced arms\r\ncould give it, and, striking the scow fair in the side, it smashed in\r\nthe planks as if they had been pipe-stems, and, before Bob could tell\r\nwhat was going on, he found himself floating about in the cold waters\r\nof the harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WRECK OF THE GO AHEAD. (Page 55.)]\r\n\r\nWith an appearance of amazement that was well assumed, Sam, with one\r\nsweep of his oar, brought his yawl broadside to the wharf, and gazed at\r\nthe wreck he had made; then, discovering the fisher-boy floating about\r\nin the water, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bobby Jennings, is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is any need of your asking that question,\"\r\nreturned the fisher-boy, angrily; \"I hope you are satisfied, now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bobby, I had no idea that I was so clost to you,\" said Sam, who\r\ncould scarcely conceal his exultation from the men on the wharf. \"Here!\r\nketch hold of this oar, an' I'll haul you in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can take care of myself,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bobby, may I be sunk in the harbor this very minute, if I\"----.\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Sam,\" exclaimed the fisher-boy, striking out for a\r\nvessel that lay along-side the wharf, a little distance off. \"You need\r\nnot talk to me; I know all about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe bully, anxious to conceal the real facts of the case from the\r\nship-carpenters, loudly protested that it was all an accident--that he\r\nwas innocent of any intention to disable the scow--and he even followed\r\nBob as he swam toward the vessel; but the latter would not listen to\r\nhim; he knew that Sam had sunk his boat on purpose, and he did not wish\r\nto speak to him again, if he could avoid it.\r\n\r\nThere was a staging moored along-side the vessel which had been placed\r\nthere by some caulkers, who were then about to begin their day's\r\nwork, and Bob crawled upon it, climbed up the ropes to the deck, and\r\nso reached the wharf. He walked to the spot where the collision had\r\noccurred, but nothing was to be seen of the Go Ahead. She had brought\r\nin her last load of fish, finished her work of carrying passengers\r\nacross the harbor, and her wreck was at that moment lying beneath the\r\nwaters which had so often been the scenes of her triumphs. Clumsy and\r\nleaky as she was, she had been of great service to the fisher-boy,\r\nand he felt her loss severely. He had built her himself, had sailed\r\nmany a long mile in her up and down the bay, and it was no wonder that\r\nthe tears started to his eyes when he gazed at the spot where she\r\nhad disappeared. Sam Barton stood in his yawl, which lay at a little\r\ndistance from the wharf, watching the movements of his discomfited\r\nrival, and, now that there was no one near to observe him, or to\r\noverhear what he had to say, he did not seem to be so very sorry for\r\nwhat he had done; on the contrary, he smiled grimly, and said, in an\r\ninsulting tone:\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you, Bobby Jennings? Didn't I say that you shouldn't\r\nrun no craft, except my skiff, in this ere harbor? I guess you won't go\r\nround beatin' fellers an' winnin' half-dollars now. If you want to make\r\nfriends with me, you know where I live.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the bully started off to hunt up a passenger, leaving the\r\nfisher-boy gazing thoughtfully down into the water. He had scarcely\r\nheard what Sam was saying, for he was trying to think up some plan for\r\nraising the Go Ahead. Wouldn't it be a glorious triumph for him if he\r\ncould coax her to the surface of the water again, repair her, and take\r\nher back into the harbor to trouble Sam Barton and the rest of his\r\nrivals? If he only had a rope made fast to her, he could, with a little\r\nassistance, haul her upon the wharf; and he was confident that, in one\r\nday's time, he could fix her up as good as new. But, after thinking the\r\nmatter over, Bob was forced to come to the conclusion that he might as\r\nwell try to hit upon the best plan for pulling the earth up to the sun,\r\nfor the one was, to him, almost as hard a feat to accomplish as the\r\nother. The water was much too deep for him to dive down with a rope;\r\nand, even if he had a line made fast to her, where could he raise force\r\nenough to hoist her upon the wharf? Certainly not among the ferry-boys,\r\nfor they had all sided with Sam against him. Beyond a doubt, he had\r\nseen the last of the Go Ahead; and, as he came to this conclusion, the\r\ntears started to his eyes again, and he walked hastily away from the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGOING IN DEBT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy would have been very different from most youngsters of\r\nhis age, if he had not felt angry at Sam Barton for what he had done.\r\nHe thought it was a cowardly way of taking revenge upon a rival, and\r\nif the bully had been upon the wharf at that moment, he might have\r\ndiscovered, to his cost, that Bob's muscles were very strong, and his\r\nfists very hard. But a boy who can be guilty of so mean a trick is\r\nnever possessed of a great deal of courage, and Sam was wise enough to\r\nkeep out of the fisher-boy's way.\r\n\r\nIf Tom Newcombe could have been a witness of what had just taken\r\nplace in the harbor, he would have been immensely delighted. It was a\r\nstrong argument in his favor, and it went further toward gaining the\r\nfisher-boy's assistance in carrying out his plans, then any thing he\r\ncould have said or done. It is true, that the loss of his boat did\r\nnot compel Bob to invest in the lottery--indeed, he had once or twice\r\nalmost decided that he would have nothing to do with it; that if any\r\npart of his fifteen dollars was used, it should go toward paying for\r\na new skiff. He had several times been on the point of coming to the\r\nsensible conclusion that Tom's scheme was a humbug, and that if he ever\r\nhoped to become a rich man he must labor faithfully and save every\r\ncent of his money. But Bob had a hard lesson to learn. Before he was\r\nan hour older all these good resolutions were forgotten, and Tom had\r\ncarried his point. It was all the result of the loss of the Go Ahead.\r\n\r\nAs Sam Barton had told his companions the evening before, Bob could not\r\nlive without a boat, and now the question that had been troubling him\r\nso long must be answered, and that very speedily. He might have built\r\nanother scow--for there happened to be plenty of lumber floating about\r\nat the upper end of the harbor--but he was a very poor ship-carpenter,\r\nand by the time his craft could be completed, his fifteen dollars would\r\nall be gone. Besides, the boat would, no doubt, be quite as clumsy\r\nand leaky as the Go Ahead had been; and he knew, by experience, that\r\nwith such a craft, he could not make ferrying a paying business. He\r\nmust have a boat as good as any in the harbor, or he could not hope to\r\nsecure custom. Such a one he could not build; he had no money to buy\r\nit, and his only alternative was to follow Tom's suggestion, and \"go in\r\ndebt for it.\" This was the conclusion Bob came to as he walked toward\r\nhis home thinking the matter over; and, after a moment's hesitation, he\r\nturned and bent his steps toward Mr. Graves's ship-yard.\r\n\r\nHe was now about to add a new chapter to his experience, and he hardly\r\nknew how to begin operations. He had never asked a man to credit him,\r\nand his first hard work must be to decide upon the words he ought to\r\nuse to introduce his business with Mr. Graves. But his wits seemed\r\nto have wandered to the ends of the earth; for, when he reached the\r\nship-yard, he was as badly puzzled as ever to know what he ought to say\r\nto the boat-builder. He glanced in at the gate and saw the proprietor\r\nof the yard walking about among his men, and in the bay beyond he saw a\r\nlittle fleet of skiffs, with any one of which he was certain he could\r\nvery soon double his fortune. Bob stepped inside the gate, but there\r\nhis courage failed him, and he turned and walked out again. For ten\r\nminutes he stood leaning against the fence, sometimes almost resolved\r\nto walk boldly into the yard and settle his business at once, but\r\noftener on the point of starting for Fishertown as fast as his legs\r\ncould carry him; and every one who passed him, turned and looked at his\r\ndripping garments, no doubt wondering why he did not go home and change\r\nthem. But the truth of the matter was, Bob had no dry ones to put on.\r\nThe clothes he had at that moment on his back were all he possessed\r\nin the world, and, just then, the probabilities were that, if he did\r\nnot soon take some decided step he would never be any better off. The\r\nfisher-boy thought of this, and once more glancing in at the gate,\r\nhe saw that Mr. Graves had left his workmen, and was walking toward\r\nhis office. Now was his time, if ever. Drawing in a long breath, and\r\ncalling all his courage to his aid, he entered the yard and approached\r\nthe boat-builder, who stopped and looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bob,\" said he, \"have you been in swimming with your clothes on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the reply, \"but I couldn't help it. Sam Barton sunk my\r\nboat for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did! The young rascal! That boy is going to State's prison by the\r\nlightning express train. I wouldn't have any thing to do with him, Bob.\r\nYou have no boat now, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the fisher-boy, sorrowfully; and when he thought of\r\nthe Go Ahead, he could not keep back his tears.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Mr. Graves, kindly, \"you have not lost much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have lost a great deal, sir,\" replied Bob. \"I can't live without a\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can't,\" said Mr. Graves, briskly. \"You must get another.\r\nNow, perhaps I can sell you one of my nice little skiffs. They are\r\nvery cheap, and warranted fast. Better take one of 'em, Bob, and then\r\nyou can pay off Sam Barton by taking all his passengers away from him.\r\nWouldn't that be glorious?\"\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder evidently became excited as he said this, for he\r\npunched Bob in the ribs with his fingers, and laughed so loudly that he\r\nwas heard all over the ship-yard.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to have one of them,\" said the fisher-boy, \"but I've got no\r\nmoney to pay for it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Graves, drawing back and stroking his whiskers--\"that's\r\nbad--a person can't buy any thing without money; that's been my\r\nexperience.\" As he said this, he looked out over the bay and began\r\nto whistle, as if he had nothing further to say on the subject. This\r\ngreatly discouraged Bob, for he saw that Mr. Graves had suddenly lost\r\nall interest in his affairs. \"He knows that I am going to ask him to\r\ntrust me!\" thought the fisher-boy, and he had hit the mark exactly.\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder was like a great many other men; he could afford to\r\noffer his sympathy to any one in distress, because it did not cost him\r\nany thing. He had spoken so kindly to Bob, because he thought he had\r\ncome there to buy one of his boats, and was ready to pay the money as\r\nsoon as the bargain could be concluded; but when he learned that the\r\nfisher-boy's pockets were empty, his feelings changed instantly. If Bob\r\ncould have paid the cash for his boat, he would have left the ship-yard\r\nfirm in his belief that Mr. Graves was one of the kindest men in the\r\nworld; as it was, he began to believe him to be the most hard-hearted.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the fisher-boy stood looking down at the ground in great\r\nperplexity. He scarcely knew what to say next, but he finally decided\r\nthat the best course he could pursue would be to state his business at\r\nonce. He wanted it settled one way or the other, for he did not like to\r\nbe kept in suspense.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Graves,\" said he, with a desperate effort, \"I came here to ask\r\nyou if you would sell me one of your skiffs on time. I'll pay you for\r\nit in three months.\" (He was at first going to say one month, as Tom\r\nhad suggested; but what if the lottery scheme should fail? He did not\r\nbelieve that any such disappointment was in store for him, but still,\r\nit was best to be on the safe side).\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy was astonished at himself. He had not believed that he\r\npossessed the courage to ask the question he had just propounded, and\r\nthe words had scarcely passed his lips before he was sorry that he had\r\never uttered them. He was certain that he had lowered himself in Mr.\r\nGraves's estimation, and that gentleman's conduct gave him reason for\r\nthis belief. He opened his eyes in amazement, and looked the fisher-boy\r\nvery hard in the face, as if he could hardly believe that he was in\r\nearnest. For the first time in his life, Bob had met a man he could\r\nnot look fairly and squarely in the eye. He hung his head as if he\r\nhad been guilty of a very mean action, and almost expected to hear the\r\nship-builder order him out of the yard. He waited impatiently for his\r\nanswer, but it was not given immediately, for Mr. Graves picked up a\r\nstick and began to whittle it with his knife, at the same time running\r\nhis eye over his little fleet of skiffs with a sort of affectionate\r\nlook, as if they stood very high in his estimation, and he was not\r\nwilling to sell any of them \"on time.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, to the fisher-boy's immense relief, he threw away the stick,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\"How do I know that you will pay me at the end of three months?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you that I will work day and night to raise the money,\"\r\nanswered Bob. \"Besides, I will give you my note.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves laughed loudly. \"I am afraid your note would not be worth\r\nmuch,\" said he. \"But I have always heard you spoken of as an honest,\r\nhard-working boy, and I am willing to give you a little assistance.\r\nCome with me!\"\r\n\r\nBob could scarcely credit his ears. He followed the boat-builder like\r\none in a dream; and not until Mr. Graves stepped into a yawl and pushed\r\noff toward the spot where the skiffs were anchored, did he believe that\r\nit was all a reality, and that he was soon to be the owner of one of\r\nthe finest boats in the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Mr. Graves, pulling up along-side one of the\r\nskiffs--\"how will the Sea Gull suit you?\"\r\n\r\nThe boat in question was one of the most beautiful little things Bob\r\nhad ever seen. She was painted white inside and out, her bow and stern\r\nwere shaped alike, and both were as sharp as a knife. She was intended\r\nfor a fast boat, and the name which was painted on her bows suited her\r\nexactly, for she sat on the water as lightly as a feather.\r\n\r\n\"What is she worth?\" asked the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five dollars,\" was the reply; \"and that pays for a sail and a\r\npair of strong oars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" said Bob, who was so overjoyed and excited that he could\r\nscarcely stand still, \"there is no need of looking any farther. I'll\r\ntake her if you will paint out that name and give her another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it,\" replied the boat-builder; \"but I shall have to charge you\r\nan extra dollar for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy had seen the time that this would have made him\r\nhesitate. Heretofore he had always looked upon a dollar as quite a\r\nrespectable sum of money, and one well worth saving; but now, from\r\nsome cause or other, it did not look so large in his eyes, and he was\r\nwilling to pay it for having a new name painted on his boat.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said he. \"I want to call her the 'Go Ahead No. 2.' I'd\r\nlike to have you get her ready as soon as possible, for I am in a hurry\r\nto get to work with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have her to-night at five o'clock,\" said Mr. Graves, pushing\r\nthe yawl toward the shore, \"and I want you to go straight to the harbor\r\nand settle up with Sam Barton. Don't let him take a single passenger\r\nacross if you can help it. But remember, Bob, I must have my money at\r\nthe end of three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you that it shall be ready for you,\" said the fisher-boy\r\npromptly, as if twenty-six dollars was a very insignificant sum of\r\nmoney in his estimation, and he could raise it at any moment. \"I\r\nthink, in fact I know, that I shall be able to pay you in four weeks\r\nfrom to-day.\" As Bob said this, he thought of the lottery.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the yawl reached the shore the fisher-boy took leave of Mr.\r\nGraves, and left the ship-yard with a much lighter heart than he had\r\nbrought into it. The question that had been troubling him so long was\r\nsettled at last, and he was the owner of a boat that he believed to\r\nbe far superior to any craft of the kind about the village. Although\r\nhe did not feel any better natured toward Sam Barton, he could not\r\nhelp laughing when he thought how astonished the bully would be when\r\nhe saw the rival whom he imagined he had so effectually disabled sail\r\ninto the harbor in a boat as good, if not better, than his own. Bob\r\ndid not believe that, reckless as he knew him to be, he would dare\r\nattempt the destruction of his skiff, for by such a proceeding he\r\nwould render himself liable to prosecution before a court of law. The\r\nfisher-boy, however, was not yet acquainted with Sam Barton. The bully,\r\nwhen he had determined upon his course, always exhibited a great deal\r\nof resolution in carrying it out; and, having decided that Bob had\r\nlived in Fishertown long enough, it was not his intention to allow\r\nhim a moment's peace until he had been driven out of the harbor, and\r\ncompelled to take up his abode somewhere else. The result of this\r\ncontest was doubtful. The fisher-boy was not wanting in courage, and\r\nwhen he became fairly aroused he was rather an unpleasant fellow to\r\nhave about. He was very independent, he did not believe in privileged\r\nclasses, and knowing that he had as much right in the harbor as any\r\nbody, it was very likely that he would stand his ground as long as\r\npossible. Just at that moment he would not have been afraid of a dozen\r\nSam Bartons. He had a nice boat, and he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing, however, that marred his happiness, and that\r\nwas the thought that perhaps his mother would not approve of what he\r\nhad done. He had often heard her say that when a person was in debt\r\nhe was in danger; but now, Bob thought differently. He did not see\r\nhow he could get himself into trouble, simply because he had gone in\r\ndebt for a boat worth twenty-six dollars. Even if the lottery scheme\r\nfailed--an event which he now imagined to be impossible--he would have\r\nno difficulty in settling the note when it fell due, for, if fishing\r\ndid not pay him, ferrying would; and, if business in the harbor should\r\nbecome dull, he would devote all his time to fishing. It is true he\r\ncould remember that sometimes fishing and ferrying had both proved very\r\nunprofitable; but the reason was, because he had nothing but a clumsy\r\nold scow to work with; now the case would be different, because he was\r\nthe owner of a splendid little skiff. In short, Bob really believed\r\nthat the fish, which had refused to bite at his bait when it dangled\r\nover the side of his leaky scow, would be utterly unable to resist the\r\ntemptation when his line was thrown from the stern of the Go Ahead No.\r\n2. How he reached this conclusion was best known to himself. Perhaps it\r\nwas because his conscience troubled him, and he was obliged to make use\r\nof all the arguments he could think of to quiet it.\r\n\r\nThere was another matter, besides the payment of his debt, that weighed\r\nheavily on his mind, in spite of all he could do to prevent it. It\r\nintruded itself upon him with every step he made toward his home,\r\nand, although he tried to dismiss it with an impatient, \"I know it\r\nwill come out all right, and mother will never know the difference,\"\r\nhe could not rid his mind of the thought, that, to say the least, he\r\nwas about to be guilty of a very mean action. The nearer he got to\r\nFishertown the slower he walked; but he reached his home at last, and\r\nhis appearance without his boat caused a great commotion in the house.\r\nWithout waiting to be questioned, the fisher-boy began his story. His\r\nbrothers listened with looks of amazement and indignation, but Bob saw\r\nthat his mother was troubled. She was, no doubt, wondering how the\r\nfamily was to be supported, now that the Go Ahead was gone.\r\n\r\n\"O, it's all right,\" said Bob, cheerfully. \"I've got another boat that\r\ncan't be beaten by any thing about Newport. I'd like to see Sam Barton\r\nsmash her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get your new boat?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\"From Mr. Graves. She cost me twenty-six dollars, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you earn so much money?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't paid for her yet,\" replied the fisher-boy. \"I am to\r\nsettle with Mr. Graves in ninety days. He said that I was an honest,\r\nhard-working boy, and he would give me a lift.\"\r\n\r\nBob did not like to see that troubled look on his mother's face, and he\r\nwas in hopes that this announcement would drive it away; but, contrary\r\nto his expectations, it seemed to increase it.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that Mr. Graves has so good an opinion of you,\" said his\r\nmother; \"and I don't want you to lose it. For that reason, I am very\r\nsorry that you went in debt to him. Suppose you are not able to pay\r\nfor your boat at the end of three months?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, mother,\" said Bob, \"there's no need of supposing any thing of the\r\nkind. I'll work night and day, and I know that, with that nice boat I\r\ncan earn twenty-six dollars in less than ninety days. If I can't, I\r\nhad better shut up shop. I tell you, mother, it isn't every ferry-boy\r\nthat can go to Mr. Graves and get trusted for a skiff. I've got a good\r\nreputation, and I mean to keep it. And I'll tell you another thing,\"\r\nhe added, mysteriously, \"we are not going to live in this tumble-down\r\nshantee much longer. In a very short time we'll be living in a nice\r\nlittle house in the upper end of the village, among respectable people,\r\nthese two youngsters will be going to school, and I shall be at sea,\r\nleaving behind me more than money enough to support you while I am\r\ngone. What do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n(Tom Newcombe's ideas were gaining ground rapidly.)\r\n\r\nBob's mother did not know what to think of it. She had never listened\r\nto such a speech before, and she could not imagine what had got into\r\nBob to raise his spirits so wonderfully. However, she did not give that\r\nmuch thought, for she could not forget the debt of twenty-six dollars,\r\nwhich must be paid before they could leave Fishertown and take up their\r\nabode in a \"nice little house in the upper end of the village.\" But\r\nshe said nothing more in regard to it, thinking, no doubt, that as the\r\nmischief had been done, the less said about it the better. Besides, she\r\nhad almost unlimited confidence in Bob, and, knowing that he possessed\r\na great deal of energy, and was not easily discouraged, she hoped that\r\nhe might, after all, succeed in raising the money by the time agreed\r\nupon. If she had any fears on the subject, she kept them to herself.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy brightened up when he saw that his mother was not\r\ndisposed to find fault with him for what he had done, but his\r\nface instantly clouded up again when he thought of something very\r\ndisagreeable he had yet to perform. His mother noticed it, and asked\r\nhim what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much!\" replied Bob, \"only you don't seem to be very glad that\r\nI have got a new boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be delighted if it was paid for,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the fisher-boy, putting his hand into his pocket and\r\npulling out the money he had earned that morning, \"if I pay some on it\r\nnow, I won't have so much to pay by and by. You can spare five dollars,\r\ncan't you?\"\r\n\r\nHis mother replied that he could have the money if he wanted it, and\r\ntaking her purse out of her pocket she began to count out the bills.\r\nShe noticed that her son was very uneasy, that he could not stand\r\nstill, but kept walking backward and forward over the floor; and if\r\nshe had looked at him, she would have been astonished to see that his\r\nface was very red, and that he looked as if he had been caught in\r\ndoing something which he knew to be wrong. Bob did indeed feel like a\r\ncriminal; but he took the bills his mother handed him, and thrusting\r\nthem into his pocket, he hastily left the house, leaving his mother to\r\nsuppose that he was going to give them to Mr. Graves. Whether or not he\r\ndid so, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTOM ORDERS A NEW BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, Bob had deceived his mother, and,\r\nas may be imagined, he did not feel very happy over it. His first\r\nthought was to get as far away from her as possible; and with this\r\ndetermination he bent his steps toward the wharf, where he sat down to\r\nthink the matter over. He had never been taught to measure every act\r\nof his life by a moral standard, but, heretofore, when any thing had\r\nbeen proposed to him, he had always asked himself the question: Is it\r\nhonorable and manly, or is it mean and cowardly? This test was applied\r\nto the matter in hand, and Bob was, of course, compelled to decide\r\nthat he had been guilty of an act with which he would not like to have\r\nevery one in the world acquainted. He knew that he ought to pay the\r\nfive dollars to Mr. Graves, or, what would have been still better, take\r\nit back to his mother, make a clean breast of the whole matter, and be\r\ngoverned by her advice. Once he even got up from the coil of rope on\r\nwhich he was sitting, and started off as if he had resolved to follow\r\nthis course of conduct; but he had made scarcely half a dozen steps\r\nbefore some of Tom's arguments flashed through his mind. He stopped,\r\nhesitated, and finally returned to his seat.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all boys are more or less inclined to build\r\nair-castles. They love to go off alone where there will be no one\r\nto disturb them, and spend hour after hour picturing to themselves\r\ninnumerable pleasant things that will be sure to happen if some of\r\ntheir pet schemes can only be carried out. Some boys keep these\r\ndreamings to themselves, while others, like Tom Newcombe, can not rest\r\neasy until they have communicated them to some of their particular\r\nfriends; and when there is one such boy in a neighborhood he sometimes\r\ndoes a great deal of mischief. Tom, for instance, had completely\r\nupset the fisher-boy. We know what good resolutions Bob made while he\r\nwas sailing home from his fishing-grounds, on the previous day, and,\r\nno doubt, he would have held to them, if he could have avoided that\r\nunfortunate interview with Tom Newcombe. But he had listened to his\r\narguments, been carried away by his eloquence, doubted at first, then\r\nbelieved, and finally ended by becoming as certain of success as was\r\nTom himself. This led him to take two steps in the wrong direction. He\r\nhad gone in debt for a boat, when he knew all the time that his mother\r\nwould not approve of it, and then, by leading her to believe that he\r\nwanted to pay part of the money down, he had got the five dollars to\r\ninvest in the lottery. It was no wonder his conscience troubled him. It\r\nkept him in a very unpleasant frame of mind, and the arguments he made\r\nuse of to pacify it ought to have made him ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't tell mother that I was honestly and truly going to pay this\r\nmoney to Mr. Graves,\" said the fisher-boy to himself. \"I only said\r\nthat _if_ I paid some on the boat now, I wouldn't have so much to pay\r\nby and by. Wasn't that the truth? Of course it was. I never told a\r\nlie in my life, and I never will. I'm in a bad fix,\" he added, rising\r\nto his feet, and walking up and down the wharf, \"and this is the only\r\nway I can see to get out of it. I must save fifty-six dollars before\r\nI can go to sea--twenty-six to pay for my boat, and thirty to support\r\nthe family while I am gone; and, at the rate I have been making money\r\nfor the last year, I never will be able to lay by half that sum. I'll\r\nhave to be a fisherman as long as I live, if I can't find other ways to\r\nmake something. Now, here's a chance for me to get rich; and wouldn't\r\nI be foolish to throw it away? If it fails--but Tom says it can't, and\r\nI believe it--I shall be only five dollars out of pocket, and not much\r\nworse off than I am now. If it succeeds, and I get half of the five\r\nthousand dollars, what can I not do with it? I'll pay for my boat at\r\nonce; then I'll buy mother a nice house; I'll get some good clothes for\r\nmyself; I'll send my brothers to school--perhaps the military academy\r\nwould be the best place for them--then I'll be off to sea. I'll do it;\r\nthat's settled. I'll find Tom and give him this money before I am five\r\nminutes older.\"\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to reconsider the matter, the fisher-boy started on a\r\nkeen run down the wharf, and presently found himself at the door of Mr.\r\nNewcombe's office. Tom was seated in his father's arm-chair, his feet\r\nupon the desk, a newspaper in his hand, and a pen behind his ear. He\r\nhappened to be looking out the door as Bob came up, and throwing down\r\nhis paper, he hurried out to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hear what you've got to say!\" said he, in a whisper. \"Yes or\r\nno!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the fisher-boy. \"Here's the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for you,\" exclaimed Tom, as he took the bills. \"Our fortune's\r\nmade, sure enough;\" and catching Bob by the arm, he danced him about\r\nthe wharf as if he had suddenly lost his wits.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't let this splendid chance slip through your\r\nfingers!\" he continued, leading the fisher-boy off on one side, so that\r\nthey might converse without fear of being overheard. \"When the money\r\ncomes I'll divide with you honestly. You are not afraid to trust me?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no!\" was the reply. \"But are you _sure_ those men will send you that\r\nprize?\" (The fisher-boy knew what Tom's answer would be. All he wanted\r\nwas encouragement.)\r\n\r\n\"Certainty I am!\" said Tom, emphatically. \"If I didn't know it, do\r\nyou suppose I would risk my money in it? Didn't they make the offer\r\nthemselves, and don't they say that they have agents in every civilized\r\ncountry on the globe? Do you suppose that men known all over the world\r\nas they are would dare cheat any body? You need not be afraid. They\r\nare business men. I know that, because this letter-paper is printed,\r\njust like father's; and they will not injure their reputation by making\r\nfalse promises. They have too much at stake. I knew you would give me a\r\nfavorable answer, and so I wrote to them.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom spoke he pulled a letter out of his pocket and handed it to the\r\nfisher-boy.\r\n\r\nIt conveyed to E. H. Harris and Company the information that Tom was\r\nperfectly willing to act as their agent, and that if they would keep\r\ntheir promise, and send him the five thousand dollars, he would show\r\nit to every man, woman, and child in Newport. He told them that they\r\nwould find him to be the most faithful and obliging man in their\r\nemploy. (Tom said _man_, because he was afraid the gentlemen might\r\nwithdraw their offer, if they should learn that he was only a boy\r\nfifteen years of age.) He further informed them, that he was clerk\r\nin the largest commission house in the village, and that he was well\r\nenough acquainted with business to know that an agent could not hope\r\nto secure customers, unless he was very polite and accommodating;\r\nconsequently, they might rest assured that he would always treat their\r\npatrons with the greatest kindness. All this, and a great deal more,\r\ndid Tom say to the proprietors of the lottery; but his letter, besides\r\nbeing pretty well mixed up, was so badly written and spelled that it is\r\ndoubtful if the men to whom it was addressed ever got at the sense of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen the fisher-boy had finished reading the letter he handed it back\r\nto Tom, who placed it in an envelope along with the ten dollars--five\r\nof his own money, and the five Bob had brought him--and carefully\r\nsealed it, saying as he did so, \"You see that I put the money in the\r\nletter, don't you? Now, come with me to the post-office.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy would have been willing to entrust the business entirely\r\nin Tom's hands; but, to satisfy him, he saw the letter dropped into\r\nthe box, and then took leave of his companion, who hurried back to the\r\noffice. He found very little to be done there, and after loitering\r\nabout for half an hour, put on his cap and went out again.\r\n\r\nHe was highly elated at the success of his plans thus far, and he found\r\nit exceedingly difficult to control himself. Sometimes he was tempted\r\nto hunt up some of his acquaintances and reveal to them his secret;\r\nbut he could not forget that they had turned him out of the society of\r\nNight-hawks, without giving him an opportunity to say a word in his\r\ndefense, and refused him admittance into their new organization. In\r\nhis estimation, these were offenses that ought not to be forgiven. \"I\r\ntold them I would make them sorry for that,\" said he to himself, \"and\r\nI wasn't joking. The Storm King will be just the thing for fishing\r\nparties and moonlight excursions, but not one of those fellows shall\r\never put a foot on her deck, until they are willing to apologize for\r\nwhat they have done. I heard one of them say that they would like to\r\nvisit Block Island and rob some of the melon patches over there, if\r\nthey only had a boat. Now, perhaps, when they see the Storm King, they\r\nwill want her! They sha'n't have her; they may look somewhere else for\r\na boat! Won't they be surprised when they learn that I am the captain\r\nand owner of the finest little craft in the village? How they will all\r\nenvy me! That's the way I shall get even with them.\"\r\n\r\nTom laughed outright as these thoughts passed through his mind, and\r\nthrusting his hands into his pockets, he started off with a \"hop,\r\nskip, and a jump,\" and finally turned down the street that led to\r\nMr. Graves's boat-yard. He found the proprietor in his office, and,\r\nhardly waiting to return his polite greeting, Tom seated himself in the\r\nnearest chair, and began business at once.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Graves,\" said he, \"you built the Swallow, I believe! What did she\r\ncost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and fifty dollars!\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose the boat I want will cost at least a hundred dollars\r\nmore?\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That, of course, depends upon circumstances,\" replied Mr. Graves,\r\nwho was not at all surprised at these questions, for this was not the\r\nfirst time Tom had talked with him on this same subject. \"If you want\r\na vessel finished off in first-class style, with a nice little cabin,\r\ntwo state-rooms finely furnished, a galley forward, with stove and\r\nevery thing complete, and bunks for three or four hands--in short, a\r\nmagnificent little yacht--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it!\" exclaimed Tom, excited by his description. \"That's\r\nwhat I want!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Mr. Graves, \"for you and I have talked this matter\r\nover before. I suppose your father has at last given you permission to\r\nbuild a boat of this kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, never mind my father,\" said Tom, impatiently. \"Isn't it enough\r\nfor you to know that your money will be ready the moment the boat is\r\nfinished? What will a craft like that cost?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves looked intently at the floor for a moment, stroked his\r\nwhiskers, and replied: \"Four hundred dollars!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That's rather steep, I should say. However,\r\nI must have a vessel, and I don't care what she costs. Now listen to\r\nme! In the first place, I want this boat called the Storm King. She\r\nmust be sloop-rigged, carrying as much canvas as can safely be put on\r\nher. Her hull must be painted black on the outside, and the cabin must\r\nbe finished off with black walnut, and supplied with the finest kind\r\nof furniture; and, last of all, she must be warranted to beat every\r\nvessel of her size about the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" exclaimed Mr. Graves, who, believing that he had got a\r\npaying customer this time, listened attentively to all Tom had to say.\r\n\r\n\"And remember, also,\" continued Tom, \"that I want her finished as soon\r\nas possible--the sooner the better. As I told you before, your money\r\nwill be ready the moment I accept the vessel. If she doesn't suit me, I\r\nshall not take her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" said the boat-builder. \"But what are you going to do\r\nwith her, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to be a trader. I expect soon to make my fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly you will! What's to prevent it, I'd like to know? A boat of\r\nthat description would make any man independently rich. I have a strong\r\nforce,\" added Mr. Graves, as Tom arose to go, \"and I'll promise to have\r\nher finished alow and aloft in fine style, by three weeks from to-day.\r\nWill that suit you?\"\r\n\r\nTom replied that it would. He then took leave of the boat-builder,\r\nwho, true to his promise, called in one of his workmen, and gave him\r\nsome instructions in regard to building the sloop, which he intended\r\nshould be the finest little vessel that had ever been launched at his\r\nyard. He had not the slightest suspicion that every thing was not just\r\nas it should be, for Tom had more than once assured him that some day\r\nhe would gain his father's consent to a certain little plan, and that\r\nthen he wanted a boat that would throw all the other yachts about the\r\nvillage completely into the shade. The boat-builder never imagined that\r\nTom would dare enter into such an agreement without the permission of\r\nMr. Newcombe, for what could a boy of his age do to earn four hundred\r\ndollars in three weeks? But then Mr. Graves knew nothing about the\r\nlottery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fisher-boy was loitering about the wharf, scarcely\r\nknowing what to do with himself. If the loss of the Go Ahead had\r\noccurred two days before, Bob would not have been long in deciding how\r\nhe ought to pass the time away, for he would have employed himself\r\nin doing odd jobs about the village, and thus earned a few dimes to\r\nincrease his little fortune. But now, he had no idea of doing any thing\r\nof the sort; for when Mr. Henry asked him if he did not want to earn\r\na quarter of a dollar, by carrying in a cord of wood, that was piled\r\non the wharf at the back of the store, Bob replied that he did not,\r\nthat he was not looking for work. It is true he regretted his decision\r\na moment afterward, but then it was too late, for Mr. Henry had hired\r\nsome one else.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said the fisher-boy to himself. \"I haven't lost much.\r\nTwenty-five cents for two hours' hard work is small pay. I've seen the\r\nday that I would have been glad to take all such jobs, but I'm better\r\noff in the world now; at least I soon will be.\"\r\n\r\nAll that forenoon, Bob walked up and down the wharf, watching the men\r\nat work about him, wishing that five o'clock would come, so that he\r\nmight take possession of his new boat, and all the while wondering why\r\nit was that he was so miserable, while every one around him seemed\r\nto be so supremely happy. Again and again did he try to silence his\r\nconscience by saying to himself that his mother would never know any\r\nthing about the deception of which he had been guilty. Tom's plan would\r\ncertainly succeed, and when he had his twenty-five hundred dollars\r\nin his pocket, he would pay for his boat, and then he would never go\r\nin debt or deceive his mother again. But these promises of better\r\nbehavior in future did not quiet his feelings, for, in spite of all he\r\ncould do to prevent it, the knowledge of the fact that he had abused\r\nthe confidence his mother had reposed in him, would force itself upon\r\nhis mind, and when twelve o'clock came the fisher-boy had become so\r\nthoroughly disgusted with himself that he did not want to go home to\r\nhis dinner. He felt like an outlaw; and he could almost bring himself\r\nto believe that, if he should make his appearance at the door of his\r\nhome, he would be refused admittance. But, knowing that if he remained\r\naway all day it would occasion surprise, and might arouse suspicion,\r\nthe fisher-boy endeavored to dismiss all his unpleasant thoughts,\r\ntried hard to assume a cheerful look, and rather reluctantly started\r\nfor home. To his surprise, he found that the cloud had vanished from\r\nhis mother's face, and that she appeared to be as happy and contented\r\nas ever. She made no allusions to any thing that had transpired that\r\nmorning, and Bob began to gain courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GO AHEAD NO. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour passed off as usual, and one to have seen Bob as he\r\narose from the table and bade his mother good-by before returning to\r\nthe wharf, would have thought him the very last boy who could have been\r\nguilty of a mean or dishonorable action. But he had changed wonderfully\r\nduring the last twelve hours; and having deceived his mother once, it\r\nwas easier to do it a second time.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no necessity for it, he left a false impression on\r\nher mind by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I shall see a chance to earn half a dollar or so, during the\r\nafternoon.\" This led her to believe that her son intended to hold\r\nhimself in readiness to accept any offer of work that might be made\r\nhim; while Bob himself knew that he had no such idea. He said what he\r\ndid simply because he wanted an excuse to get away from home.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Bob was totally unfit for labor of any kind. He had made\r\nso many calculations concerning the twenty-five hundred dollars, which\r\nhe was certain he should receive in a week or ten days at the very\r\nfarthest, and he was so impatient to hear from the money he had just\r\nsent off, that any thing which would have turned his thoughts into\r\nother and more profitable channels was distasteful to him. He wanted to\r\ndo nothing but think over his plans for the future; so he returned to\r\nthe wharf, where for four hours and a half he walked listlessly about\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, his eyes bent upon the ground, and his\r\nthoughts busy with his new boat, and his prospective fortune.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of the day the ferry-boys had very little business\r\nto attend to, and, from where Bob stood, he could see them lounging in\r\ntheir boats in the shade of the piers, on both sides of the harbor.\r\nAmong them he saw Sam Barton, who, seated in his fine yawl in the midst\r\nof his friends, was delivering some very amusing discourse, judging by\r\nthe peals of laughter that came from that direction.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy soon became aware of the fact that he was the subject of\r\nSam's remarks, for every now and then he could see the bully rise up in\r\nhis boat and shake his fist at him. Bob, however, very wisely made no\r\nreply to these demonstrations. He had the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nthe triumph which the bully was then enjoying was destined to be of\r\nshort duration, and that his turn would come next.\r\n\r\nThere was another boy who was very restless all that afternoon, and\r\nwho, being unable to decide upon any better way of passing the time,\r\nkept trotting up and down the wharf. It was Tom Newcombe. To save his\r\nlife he could not remain in the office more than ten minutes at a\r\ntime, and it was only by an unusual exercise of will that he kept from\r\ntelling his secret, confidentially of course, to every one he met. In\r\none of his rounds he came across the fisher-boy; and knowing that he\r\ncould sympathize with him, he kept him company during the rest of the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\"O how I do wish this week was gone,\" Tom would say, almost every five\r\nminutes, \"and that we had an answer to that letter! I am in a great\r\nhurry to begin trading. I tell you, Bob, all the boys in the village\r\nwill wish themselves in my boots when they see my new yacht.\"\r\n\r\nTo the fisher-boy's immense relief, half-past four came at last,\r\nand, bidding Tom good-by, he started for Mr. Graves's boat-yard. The\r\nproprietor was standing in the door of his office, and when he saw Bob\r\nhe called out--\r\n\r\n\"Go and get her! She is all ready for you, and I think when you have\r\ntried her you will say that she is the finest boat you ever saw. Now,\r\nif you don't ruin Sam Barton by taking every one of his passengers away\r\nfrom him, I shall be sorry that I let you have her.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he wants customers he must work for them,\" replied Bob. \"And now,\r\nMr. Graves, if you will furnish me pen and paper, I'll give you my\r\nnote.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder laughed, and more to satisfy the fisher-boy than\r\nany thing else, he gave him a chair at his desk, and looked over\r\nhis shoulder, as he dashed off the note in regular business style;\r\npromising, in ninety days from date, to pay James H. Graves twenty-six\r\ndollars, for value received.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Bob, throwing the ink off his pen, and rising from the\r\ndesk; \"I think you will find that all right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves put the note into his pocket, and conducted his customer\r\nto the place where the skiffs were anchored; and the first object upon\r\nwhich Bob's eyes rested was the Go Ahead No. 2, gracefully riding the\r\nlittle swells, and pulling at her moorings as if impatient to be off. A\r\npair of strong oars, and a sail neatly rolled up, lay upon the thwarts,\r\nand her painter, which was long enough to serve as an anchor rope, was\r\nlaid down in Flemish coil in the bow.\r\n\r\n\"Now, remember,\" said Mr. Graves, as Bob stepped into his skiff and\r\nbegan to hoist the sail, \"your note will fall due in three months from\r\nto-day, and then I shall want the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need have no fears,\" replied the fisher-boy, promptly. \"I promise\r\nyou that every cent shall be paid up long before that time.\"\r\n\r\nAs the fisher-boy spoke, he cast off the line with which the Go\r\nAhead was made fast to the beach, got out one of his oars to serve\r\nas a rudder, and, thanking the boat-builder for his repeated wishes\r\nfor unbounded success, filled away for his pier. A strong breeze\r\nwas blowing directly down the harbor, and this gave Bob a splendid\r\nopportunity to judge of the sailing qualities of his new craft. All\r\nof Mr. Graves's boats were warranted fast, but Bob soon came to the\r\nconclusion that never had a skiff been launched at his yard that could\r\nbe compared to the Go Ahead No. 2. Her sail was as large as she could\r\nconveniently carry; and, when she had got fairly started, she took a\r\n\"bone in her teeth,\" and moved down the harbor at a rate of speed that\r\ndelighted her young skipper.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy was in his element; and the only thing that kept him\r\nfrom shouting at the top of his lungs, was the fear of attracting the\r\nattention of the people on the wharves. So overjoyed was he that he\r\ncould scarcely sit still. He kept looking over every part of his boat,\r\nfirst up at the sail, then at the clean thwarts and dry bottom, so\r\ndifferent from his old scow, and then he would say to himself: \"Is she\r\nreally mine? I never thought I should be able to own a boat like this!\r\nBut she does belong to me, and no mistake; for I remember writing out a\r\nnote for Mr. Graves. Now, Sam Barton, bring on your clumsy old yawl.\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark, although uttered for the benefit of the bully, did\r\nnot reach his ears, for he was too far off to hear it, and besides, he\r\nwas busy. A party of half a dozen persons were standing upon the wharf,\r\nand Sam was sculling leisurely across to attend to their wants. Now,\r\nthat Bob Jennings, as he imagined, had been disposed of, he had nothing\r\nto fear from rivals, and he was taking his own time in getting across\r\nthe harbor. This did not seem to suit the gentlemen on the wharf, for\r\nthey several times requested him to \"hurry up,\" an invitation which\r\nSam, being too lazy to heed, pretended that he did not hear. He moved\r\nhis oar slowly about in the water, expending just strength enough upon\r\nit to keep his yawl in motion, and his eyes, probably from the force of\r\nlong habit, were wandering up and down the harbor, as if in search of\r\nmore customers.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boy, make haste, there!\" shouted one of the men. \"We don't\r\nintend to stand here in this hot sun much longer.\"\r\n\r\nSam, however, did not arouse himself in the least. On the contrary, he\r\nstopped sculling entirely, and stood looking up the harbor at a trim\r\nlittle craft that was coming directly toward him. He did not remember\r\nof having seen her before, but he could have recognized her skipper as\r\nfar as he could see him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, if this yere don't beat all the world!\" said Sam to\r\nhimself, stooping down and shading his eyes with his hand to obtain a\r\nbetter view of the approaching boat. \"If I hadn't seed Bobby Jennings\r\nsunk this mornin', I should say that that was him. But where could he\r\nget a tidy little vessel like that? I declare; if she aint the purtiest\r\nlittle--\"\r\n\r\nSam's admiration for the approaching craft ceased very suddenly, as\r\nhe noticed her somewhat singular movements, and began to understand\r\ntheir meaning. When he first discovered her, her bow was pointed toward\r\nthe wharf, as if her skipper intended to make an attempt to take his\r\npassengers away from him; but now she was headed directly down the\r\nharbor, and was coming toward him like an arrow from a bow. She was\r\nlaying almost on her side, the spray was dashing wildly about her sharp\r\nbows, and her skipper's face wore an expression that Sam did not like\r\nto see. He remembered what he had done that morning, and, believing\r\nthat the fisher-boy was about to take ample revenge upon him, he turned\r\nand sculled down the harbor with all the speed he could command. But in\r\nspite of all his exertions, the skiff gained rapidly, and the bully,\r\nseeing that escape was impossible, became so terrified that his face\r\ngrew pale, and his heart thumped against his ribs like a trip-hammer.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Bobby!\" he called out in a trembling voice, as soon as his\r\nrival came within hearing; \"what a nice boat you've got, Bobby!\"\r\n\r\nAn angry shake of the head was the only reply he received, and the\r\nskiff came on as fast as ever.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see you out again, Bobby,\" continued Sam, who was so\r\nfrightened that he was almost ready to cry. \"An' I hope--hold on,\r\nthere, Bobby, please don't run into me--\"\r\n\r\nThe skiff was now close upon him, and the bully held his breath in\r\nsuspense; but, just as he was expecting to feel the shock of the\r\ncollision, and to see the sides of his fine yawl smashed in by the\r\nsharp bow of his rival's boat, Bob, with one sweep of his oar, turned\r\naside, passing so close to the yawl that he could have jumped into her\r\nhad he felt so disposed, and ran alongside the wharf to attend to the\r\npassengers, whom Sam, in his surprise and alarm, had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you sink him?\" asked one of the men, climbing down into the\r\nskiff. \"He has kept us here for fully a quarter of an hour, and we told\r\nhim that we were in a great hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't like to sink him,\" replied the fisher-boy, as he pulled\r\ndown the sail and got out the oars. \"I had my boat sunk under me this\r\nmorning, and I know how it feels.\"\r\n\r\nBob was now given an opportunity to test the speed of his new boat when\r\npropelled by the \"white ash breeze,\" and the result was all he could\r\nhave desired. The Go Ahead skimmed over the water as lightly as a duck,\r\nin spite of the additional weight of her half dozen passengers, and by\r\nthe time the fisher-boy reached the opposite side of the harbor, he\r\nhad ceased to regret the loss of his scow, and was almost willing to\r\nbelieve that the serious injury which Sam had tried to inflict upon him\r\nwould prove to be a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bully, who stood in his boat watching Bob as he rowed\r\nacross the harbor and landed his passengers, had been allowed ample\r\ntime to recover from the fright his rival had given him. The other\r\nferry-boys were no less surprised than Sam had been, and now they began\r\nto gather around him, to hear what he had to say about it.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that new craft Jennings has got?\" asked one.\r\n\r\n\"Do I see it?\" repeated the bully, sharply. \"Haven't I got a pair of\r\neyes, and didn't he sail by within two foot of me? He's a thief, as\r\nwell as a mean feller, 'cause he's used one of them gold pieces to buy\r\nthat boat. Never mind! It won't do him no good!\"\r\n\r\nSam, assisted by some of his particular friends, at once set about\r\narranging matters to render Bob's new boat perfectly useless to him.\r\nAs before, they scattered their forces all over the harbor, some on\r\none side, and some on the other, Sam pointing out the position he\r\nwished each boy to occupy. When he had got every thing fixed to his\r\nsatisfaction, he sculled slowly toward the fisher-boy, who was standing\r\nup in his boat, watching all these movements, as if they did not\r\ninterest him in the least.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel now, Bobby?\" asked the bully, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"O, I am in excellent spirits,\" returned Bob, pleasantly. \"I feel much\r\nbetter than I did when you sunk my boat this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an amazin' fine little skiff of your'n, Bobby,\" continued Sam;\r\n\"but I don't see what you're goin' to do with it here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you? Well, you wait until I see a passenger, and I'll show you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that we knows of, you won't,\" said the bully, savagely. \"Didn't I\r\ntell you this mornin' that you had been here just long enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, but it doesn't trouble me any. Now, Sam, let me tell you\r\nsomething! If you, or any of your friends, beat me in a fair race, I\r\nshall not grumble; but if you try to take any mean advantage of me, I\r\nwon't stand it. I'll clear the harbor!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do what?\" exclaimed Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take charge of this harbor,\" repeated Bob. \"I'll drive every one\r\nof you under the piers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" said Sam. \"That's big talk for a small boy!\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of a passenger on the wharf put a stop to the conversation,\r\nand the rivals once more found themselves engaged in an exciting race.\r\nBob had a decided advantage, having a much lighter boat, and two oars\r\nto Sam's one, and he would have beaten him very easily, had not one of\r\nthe bully's friends sculled up and intercepted him. This occasioned a\r\ndelay--for Bob was obliged to stop in order to avoid a collision--and\r\nby the time he got started again, another of Sam's right-hand men had\r\nrun alongside the wharf and secured the passenger.\r\n\r\nThis convinced the fisher-boy that his enemies were not disposed to\r\nallow him \"fair play,\" and being determined not to yield to them an\r\ninch, he pulled in his oars and began to hoist his sail.\r\n\r\n\"Look out there now, Sam Barton!\" said he, \"I'm coming after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh!\" ejaculated the bully. \"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wait until I get this sail hoisted you'll find out!\" was the\r\nreply. \"Clear the track, now, if you don't want to get hurt! Jack\r\nBennett, if you want your scow sent to the bottom of the harbor, just\r\nrun athwart my hawse again!\"\r\n\r\nSam needed no second warning. He comprehended Bob's plan in an instant,\r\nand seeing that the sail began to draw, and that the skiff's bow was\r\nslowly veering round toward him, he caught up his oar and pulled for\r\nthe shelter of the pier as if his life depended upon the issue.\r\n\r\n\"Run, run, fellers!\" he exclaimed. \"That ar Bobby Jennings'll sink the\r\nlast one of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe ferry-boys, believing that they had at last succeeded in arousing\r\nan ugly customer, scattered in all directions; and Bob, thinking it a\r\ncapital opportunity to show them that he was in earnest, and that it\r\nwas not his intention to allow himself to be imposed upon any longer,\r\nstarted in hot pursuit of Sam, who was doing his best to keep out of\r\nharm's way. Had the fisher-boy succeeded in overtaking him, it is\r\nhard to tell what he might have done in his excitement. He might have\r\nallowed Sam to escape after frightening him thoroughly, as he had done\r\nbefore, but fortunately his forbearance was not put to the test. Fear\r\ninfused new strength into the bully's arms, and he succeeded in running\r\nunder the wharf, where the skiff could not follow him.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon Bob had that part of the harbor\r\nall to himself. Keeping his sail hoisted, he moved swiftly about in all\r\ndirections, picking up a passenger here and there, and all the while\r\nwatching the movements of Sam Barton, who hardly dared to stir from his\r\nplace of refuge. He was not idle, however, for, calling together some\r\nof his friends, he tried to induce them to join him in an attack upon\r\nthe fisher-boy. They were all highly enraged, and there was not one\r\namong them who would have been sorry to see Bob and his new boat sunk\r\nout of sight in the waters of the harbor; but none of them could muster\r\nup courage enough to make an assault upon him.\r\n\r\nThe little skiff moved with a rapidity that threatened instant\r\ndestruction to any thing that came in her path, and not wishing to have\r\ntheir boats sent to the bottom, the ferry-boys all concluded that the\r\nsafest plan was to allow Bob a clear field. The latter did not fail to\r\nmake the most of his time. The neat appearance of his boat brought him\r\na goodly number of passengers, and when he counted his money that night\r\nbefore going home, he found that he had earned just sixty cents.\r\n\r\nHe was well satisfied with the Go Ahead No. 2.\r\n\r\n\"You're all a pack of cowards!\" said Sam to his companions, when he\r\nsaw the fisher-boy fill away for home, after taking the last passenger\r\nacross the harbor. \"All cowards, every one of you! If you had obeyed\r\nmy orders, Bobby Jennings wouldn't now be settin' in that new boat of\r\nhis'n like he was lord an' master of all of us. A good duckin' in the\r\nharbor would help him powerful, an' he must have it.\"\r\n\r\nBob having taken his departure, Sam was no longer obliged to remain\r\nunder the pier. He came out, looking very crest-fallen, and joined his\r\ncompanions, who, as they sculled slowly toward home, talked over the\r\nincidents of the afternoon, and debated upon the best plan to punish\r\nthe fisher-boy for what he had done.\r\n\r\nSam, almost too angry to speak, took no part in the conversation. His\r\ndesire to \"get even\" with the fisher-boy was now stronger than ever;\r\nfor not only had the latter, as he believed, made use of one of the\r\ntwenty dollar gold pieces to purchase his new boat, but he had actually\r\nbeaten the bully at his own game, and fully demonstrated his ability\r\nto hold the harbor against the combined attacks of Sam and all his\r\nfriends. This did not look much like driving him out of Fishertown; on\r\nthe contrary, it appeared that if Bob chose to push matters, he could\r\nhold every one of his enemies at bay.\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't give me one of them gold pieces fur my skiff,\" said Sam\r\nto himself. \"He said he was too honest for that, but he has paid 'em\r\nto somebody else fur that new boat of his'n, an' I won't stand no such\r\nnonsense. I bet he'll be astonished when he gets up to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nIf Sam had decided upon any thing new, he said nothing about it just\r\nthen. He kept behind his companions all the way, and when he arrived\r\nat the beach he secured his yawl and went directly to his own home.\r\nAs soon as it grew dark, however, he began to bestir himself. He\r\nwalked about among the cabins, and presently collected four of his\r\nfriends--the only ones among the dozen boys in Fishertown who could\r\nbe trusted in every emergency--and after a few moments' whispered\r\nconsultation, they again separated. For a quarter of an hour Sam\r\nstrolled about, stopping now and then to say a few words to some of the\r\nferry-boys he chanced to meet, until, believing that his four followers\r\nhad been allowed ample time to obey his orders, he bent his steps\r\ntoward the spot where he had left his yawl. He was very cautions in his\r\nmovements--for he did not want every one about Fishertown to know what\r\nwas going on--and when he reached his boat he stepped into it, quickly\r\ncast off the painter, and shoved away from the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all there, fellers?\" he asked, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied a voice from under the thwarts. \"All here!\"\r\n\r\nSam gave way on the oar, and in a few moments the boat entered the\r\nharbor, and shaped its course toward Mr. Newcombe's warehouse. Several\r\nvessels were lying alongside the pier, but Sam ran by them without\r\nattracting the attention of any of the watch, and finally the yawl\r\ndisappeared among the spiles that supported the wharf. Here it was as\r\ndark as midnight; but Sam, who seemed to understand what he was about,\r\npulled in his oar, and by pushing against the spiles, worked his way\r\nalong until the boat reached the extreme end of the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Friday!\" he whispered, \"strike a light!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy addressed crawled out from under the thwarts, and presently\r\nthe light of a small lantern flashed among the spiles. They were now\r\ndirectly under the warehouse, which was built, not upon the ground, but\r\nupon a pier that projected out into the harbor. It was supported by\r\ntimbers which had been driven into the mud, and so close together, that\r\nthere was hardly room for the yawl to go between them. The boat had\r\nbeen run alongside of what appeared to be an abrupt bank, about four\r\nfeet high, and as soon as the lantern had been lighted, one of the boys\r\nsprang ashore and made the painter fast to the timbers; while another\r\nremoved a board which had been placed close up under the pier, and\r\nrevealed a narrow opening which seemed to run back under the street.\r\n\r\n\"How is it. Jack?\" asked Sam, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nJack took the lantern, thrust his head into the opening, and, after\r\na hurried survey of the interior, replied: \"All right! Nobody's been\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jump ashore, then,\" continued Sam. \"Be lively, fur we don't want to\r\nkeep this light out here much longer. Somebody might be on the watch.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the yawl sprang out, and one by one squeezed themselves\r\nthrough the opening; and Sam, who was the last one to enter, pulled the\r\nboard back to its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCRUSOE AND HIS MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every boy who is able to read at all has read Robinson Crusoe,\r\nand probably nine out of ten have been foolish enough to wish they had\r\nbeen in his place. Perhaps they would not be willing to undergo the\r\ndangers of a shipwreck that they might be cast upon a desert island,\r\nfor it is by no means certain they would be so fortunate as to escape,\r\nor that the winds would be accommodating enough to blow the wreck\r\nclose in to the shore so that they might visit her, and bring away\r\nsuch articles as they needed to enable them to go to housekeeping.\r\nWhat we mean to say is, that there are restless, discontented boys in\r\nthe world who are never satisfied, and who believe that if they could\r\nonly hit upon a plan to transport themselves to some out-of-the-way\r\npart of the world, and could surround themselves with all the comforts\r\nCrusoe is said to have possessed, they would be supremely happy. Some\r\nboys content themselves with _playing_ Robinson Crusoe. A shed built\r\nin the back yard answers the purpose of cave and tent, and there they\r\nspend hour after hour, living over Crusoe-life as it is related in\r\nthe story. Imaginary foot-prints are discovered, a make-believe man\r\nFriday is rescued from blood-thirsty cannibals, and numerous attacks\r\nof savages are repulsed with terrible slaughter. Then come the finding\r\nof the Spaniard and Friday's father, the release of the English\r\ncaptain, and the recovery of the vessel that is to take Robinson\r\nfrom the island, and there the game ends; for, by the time all these\r\nthings are done, the day is generally far spent, and some of the young\r\nactors are obliged to return to their homes. We do not suppose that\r\nany of these make-believe hermits ever thought seriously of hunting\r\nup an uninhabited island in the ocean and living Crusoe-life in sober\r\nearnest? There was one boy, however, who was bold enough to conceive of\r\nsuch an idea, and that was Sam Barton. He had read the story, believed\r\nevery word of it, and was so well pleased with it that he decided to\r\nbecome a Crusoe himself.\r\n\r\nIf Sam possessed a single good trait, it was a love of reading. He\r\nnever thought of investing any of his money in books, but every piece\r\nof printed paper that he picked up in the streets was read and re-read\r\nuntil it was completely worn out. One morning, while passing by a\r\nstore, he saw a book swept out upon the sidewalk. He never allowed a\r\nprize like that to slip through his fingers, and pouncing upon it, he\r\ncarried it off in triumph. It proved to be a copy of Robinson Crusoe.\r\nIt had evidently received very rough usage, for it was soiled and badly\r\ntorn; but there was enough of it left to make Sam thoroughly disgusted\r\nwith the life of a ferry-boy, and to put some very foolish notions\r\ninto his head. Considering the story as altogether too good to be kept\r\nto himself, he took his four friends into his confidence, and, during\r\nthe three weeks following, Robinson Crusoe received the best part of\r\ntheir attention. When the book was finished its hero was declared to\r\nbe a \"jolly old feller,\" and Sam startled his companions by wondering\r\nif they couldn't have a splendid time if they should camp out on Block\r\nIsland, and live as he had done! This gave them something to think and\r\ntalk about, and the matter was discussed every time they could get\r\ntogether. They very speedily came to an understanding on one point, and\r\nthat was, that during the coming summer, they would bid farewell to\r\nNewport and turn Crusoes. This being settled, the question then arose,\r\nwhere should they go? Block Island would not answer their purpose,\r\nbecause it was in a civilized country. True, they had often seen goats\r\nthere, but they belonged to the farmers, who would not consent to\r\nhave them shot at or chased by dogs. There were grapes in abundance\r\non the island, but they grew in gardens and vineyards, and were\r\nclaimed by persons who would not permit the young Crusoes to gather\r\nthem at pleasure, even though they did want to cure them for raisins.\r\nThere were no savages in that region to visit the island with their\r\nprisoners, and there would be but a poor prospect for fights, unless\r\nit was with the farmers, or with their parents, who would, no doubt,\r\nattempt to bring them home again. This question troubled them for three\r\nor four days; and then Sam, who was the acknowledged leader of the\r\nenterprise, proposed that they should put to sea in his yawl, and \"keep\r\ngoing,\" until they found a place that suited them, a suggestion to\r\nwhich all the boys at once agreed.\r\n\r\nThe next thing they talked about was their supplies. They _might_ be\r\nfortunate enough to find the wreck of a vessel somewhere, but, after\r\nall, the prospect was not very flattering; so it was decided that\r\nevery thing of which they imagined they would stand in need should be\r\nprocured before leaving the village. They would require pieces of cable\r\nwith which to build the wall in front of their cave, canvas for their\r\ntent, an adze to cut out boards, a crowbar with which to make their\r\ncave larger after the tent was put up, a dog to chase the goats, lead\r\nfor bullets, and guns to shoot the bullets after they were made; in\r\nshort, every thing that Crusoe possessed they were determined to have;\r\nand, in order to be sure on this point, Sam, with infinite trouble,\r\nmade out a list of articles from the book.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was it settled to their satisfaction that their plans could\r\nbe carried out, than each boy began to exert himself to procure his\r\nshare of the provisions and equipment. A certain portion of the money\r\nthey earned was paid into the hands of Jack Bennett, the treasurer\r\n(who, by the way, was once soundly whipped by Sam, because he spent\r\ntwo cents of the public funds for pea-nuts), and articles of every\r\ndescription that were found about the streets and wharves, especially\r\nold horseshoes, and scraps of copper, were speedily taken in charge by\r\nthe enthusiastic members of the Crusoe band. In a very short space of\r\ntime they had a large stock of useless material on hand, and then they\r\nbegan to feel the want of a suitable hiding-place for it. This proved\r\nto be another source of trouble to them, until, one day, Jack Bennett,\r\nwhile cruising about under Mr. Newcombe's wharf, in the hope of finding\r\nsomething that would be of value to him, conceived the idea of a cave.\r\nThis plan being hailed with delight by the others, work was begun\r\nupon it that very night; and at the end of two weeks, the cave was\r\ncompleted, and all the articles they had gathered were conveyed to it\r\nfor safe keeping. A better hiding-place could not have been devised. It\r\nwas located under the street which ran in front of the warehouse, and,\r\nwhen assembled there to hold their secret meetings, the boys could hear\r\nthe wagons rattling over their heads. The entrance to their place of\r\nretreat was, as we have said, under the wharf, where no one, not even\r\nthe ferry-boys, ever thought of going. Even in the day-time it was very\r\ndark under there, but to make \"assurance doubly sure\" the door had been\r\nconcealed so that there was little probability that it would ever be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe interior of their hiding-place was finished off according to the\r\ndescription they had read of Crusoe's cave, with props in the center to\r\nkeep it from falling in upon them, and shelves on the left hand side\r\nof the entrance, upon which were stowed a variety of useful things.\r\nAgainst the walls were arranged the heavier articles, such as bits of\r\ncable, scraps of iron, lead, and copper, pieces of canvas, a small\r\ngrind-stone, a hatchet or two, several pairs of oars, some carpenter's\r\ntools, and two or three boxes containing wheat and rice, which were to\r\nbe planted as soon as they reached their island. Opposite the entrance,\r\nreposing upon a comfortable bed of straw, was a ferocious looking\r\nbull-dog, which had come to Sam in much the same way that Crusoe's dog\r\ncame to him; not from a wreck, of course, but from a schooner which\r\nwas discharging her cargo at Mr. Newcombe's wharf. Sam had often seen\r\nand admired the animal, and believing that he was just the dog they\r\nwanted to hunt goats with, he had scraped an acquaintance with him by\r\nthrowing him pieces of bread and meat, when none of the crew of the\r\nvessel happened to be looking at him. In a short time he and the dog\r\nbecame excellent friends, and one day, by exhibiting a tempting piece\r\nof beef, he induced the animal to jump overboard and follow him under\r\nthe wharf, where he was captured and put into the cave, to remain until\r\nhis master was ready to start on his voyage.\r\n\r\nUpon the walls, at the right hand of the entrance, hung five\r\nsingle-barrel shot-guns, each of which had cost the would-be Crusoes\r\ntwo dollars and a half. Below them hung their powder-horns, shot-bags\r\nand hunting knives. A flour barrel, turned bottom up, answered the\r\npurpose of a table, and upon it, protected from the damp and dirt by a\r\npiece of canvas, was the dilapidated copy of Robinson Crusoe, which was\r\nto Sam and his friends what the chart and compass are to the mariner.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Crusoe band had chosen the names of their favorite\r\nheroes; and when holding their meetings in the cave, they dropped their\r\ntrue names, and answered only to their assumed ones. Sam, of course,\r\nwas Robinson Crusoe. He was the leader of the band while they remained\r\non shore, and he was to be the captain of the vessel during the voyage,\r\nand the governor of the island when they found it. The names of the\r\nothers were Jack Spaniard, Friday, Will Atkins, and Xury. (Sam did not\r\nknow how to pronounce this last name correctly. He always called it\r\nExury.)\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said the chief, pulling off his cap and seating himself\r\non a dry goods box beside the flour barrel, \"we're ready to begin\r\nbusiness. Friday, put that lantern on the table. Have any of you any\r\nthing to offer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Will Atkins, \"I've got something we had oughter take\r\nalong. It's a watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"A watch!\" repeated the chief. \"It sha'n't go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on till you see it, governor!\" said Atkins, fumbling in his\r\npockets, and finally producing a huge brass time-piece, which ticked so\r\nloudly that it could be heard by every one in the cave. \"It's a thing a\r\nfeller can't get every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care, I don't want to see it,\" replied Sam. \"Here's the thing\r\nwe go by,\" he added, picking up the list he had made out. \"Read that,\r\nan' then read the book, an' see if you can find any thing about a watch\r\nin either of them. Crusoe didn't have no time-piece, an' we ain't a\r\ngoin' to have none, neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say he did have a watch!\" insisted Atkins. \"Don't the book say that\r\nafter he eat his dinner, he lay down an' slept till two o'clock? How\r\ndid he know when to get up if he didn't have a watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know nothin' about that! If he'd had a watch the book would\r\nhave said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall I do with this? I give a sail an' a pair of good oars\r\nfur it, an' the feller said he wouldn't never trade back!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can pitch it in the harbor, if you have a mind to,\" said Sam. \"It\r\nsha'n't go on this expedition so long as I'm governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think this is a purty how-de-do,\" said Atkins. \"If I can't have\r\nthings my way sometimes I won't go. I don't believe there ever was such\r\na cove as Robinson Crusoe, nohow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh!\" exclaimed Sam, in astonishment. \"Do you mean to say that Crusoe\r\nnever lived on that island all by himself fur so many years? Who writ\r\nthis yere book, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some feller made it up all out of his own head!\" said Atkins, boldly.\r\n\r\nThis declaration, according to the laws of the Crusoe band, was\r\ntreason, and it created an uproar in an instant. The boys all sprung\r\nto their feet, and Atkins, seeing that he got himself into trouble,\r\nseized an oar and backed into the farthest corner of the cave; while\r\nthe dog, thinking that something unusual was going on, barked and\r\nwhined furiously. It is very probable that the traitor would have been\r\nseverely handled, had not the governor interfered in his behalf.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there, men!\" he exclaimed. \"Jack Spaniard, you and Friday come\r\nback here an' set down. Exury, kick that dog and make him hush up.\r\nWill Atkins, put down that ar oar an' behave yourself, like a man had\r\noughter do!\"\r\n\r\nThe traitor hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Atkins, I say, you'd better drop that ar oar an' come here an' set\r\ndown,\" repeated the governor. \"If I take a hand in this muss, I'll make\r\nyou open your eyes!\"\r\n\r\nThe culprit evidently feared the chief more than all the rest of the\r\nband, for, without further parley, he put the oar back in its place and\r\nresumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Will Atkins,\" continued the governor, \"don't you never say\r\nagin what you said a minute ago--that there never was no such feller\r\nas Robinson Crusoe--'cause I know there was. He writ this yere book\r\nhimself; a blind man could see that, an' I aint agoin' to have no\r\nfeller say he didn't. You've got the best name of any of us! Will\r\nAtkins made them fellers in Robinson's island a heap of trouble, an'\r\nyou're tryin' to do the same thing by us. Now, I'm different from what\r\nthey were, an' I won't stand much nonsense. You can just bear that in\r\nmind. As fur that ar ole watch of your'n, if Crusoe had had one, I\r\nwouldn't say a word. But the book don't say nothin' about it, an' so I\r\nknow he didn't have none. We aint agoin' to take nothin' with us that\r\nhe didn't have, so I say again, that the watch sha'n't go. Shall it,\r\nfellers?\"\r\n\r\nJack Spaniard, Friday, and Xury, being highly enraged at the traitor,\r\nsustained the chief in his decision, and Atkins was compelled to\r\nswallow his disappointment as best he could. Strange as it may appear,\r\nhowever, this incident did not disturb the harmony of the meeting.\r\nAtkins was at first held in check by fear of the governor; but when a\r\npocketful of fish-hooks and lines which he had offered to increase the\r\ngeneral stock was accepted, it had the effect of restoring him to his\r\nusual spirits.\r\n\r\nAfter this business had been transacted, the governor entered upon a\r\ndiscussion of the subject which was just then occupying the most of\r\nhis thoughts. He began by repeating what he had told his companions\r\na hundred times before--that Bobby Jennings was the meanest fellow\r\nhe had seen for many a day, too mean to be permitted to live longer\r\nin Fishertown; that he had repeatedly refused to give him one of the\r\ntwenty-dollar gold pieces for his skiff, and had then gone off and paid\r\none, and perhaps both, of them for the Go Ahead No. 2; and, finally,\r\nthat he had shown a determination to do as he pleased in the harbor,\r\nand that was something they could not stand.\r\n\r\n\"He must have gone to bed by this time,\" continued the governor; \"so\r\nwe'll jest slip up to his shantee an' capture that fine craft of his'n.\r\nHe can't live without a boat, an' we'll see where he'll get another.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will we do with her?\" asked Friday. \"Burn her?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no!\" replied the chief; \"that would be throwing away money: we'll\r\nbring her down here and hide her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's dangerous,\" said Atkins. \"Bob'll make a powerful fuss when he\r\nfinds out that his boat is gone; an' if we should be diskivered\"----.\r\nAtkins finished the sentence by shrugging his shoulders, and shaking\r\nhis head significantly.\r\n\r\n\"We'd best burn her, or sink her in the bay,\" said Jack Spaniard, \"an'\r\nthen nobody can't prove nothin' agin us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll only be throwin' away money fur nothin',\" repeated the\r\ngovernor. \"No one in the village knows any thing about this yere cave,\r\nan' so they won't think of lookin' here fur her. When the fuss has\r\nkinder died out, we'll paint the boat over, give her a new name, an'\r\nsell her to somebody an' divide the profits. In that way, we can raise\r\na few dollars to help along the expedition, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark decided the argument in Sam's favor. The members of\r\nthe band all had the good of the expedition at heart, and any thing\r\nthat promised to advance its interests, no matter how much danger it\r\nmight bring to themselves, was heartily supported. They spent a few\r\nmoments in talking over the details of their plan, especially the\r\ncourse they ought to adopt to secure the skiff without arousing any\r\nof the inmates of the fisher-boy's cabin, and then, blowing out the\r\nlight, they crawled out of the cave, stepped into the yawl, and pulled\r\nfor the beach. The governor, being the best oarsman, again assumed\r\nthe management of the boat, while the others, as before, stretched\r\nthemselves out under the thwarts. This precaution was always adopted\r\nin going to and from the cave, for they wisely reasoned that if five\r\nboys should be seen making nightly visits to Mr. Newcombe's wharf, it\r\nmight attract attention, which would lead to an investigation, and the\r\ndiscovery of their hiding-place.\r\n\r\nUnder the chief's skillful guidance, the yawl passed through the\r\nshipping and cleared the harbor in safety; and, in accordance with\r\nthe plans they had decided upon before leaving the cave, Sam kept the\r\nboat headed out to sea until the cabins on the beach were lost to view\r\nin the darkness; then he turned, and pursued a course parallel with\r\nthe shore for about a quarter of a mile, when he again headed the\r\nyawl toward the village. By these maneuvers, he hoped to reach the\r\nfisher-boy's wharf without attracting the notice of any persons who\r\nmight happen to be walking on the beach.\r\n\r\nLong experience had made Sam a capital hand to manage expeditions of\r\nthis kind, and, knowing that it was not best to be in too great a\r\nhurry, he became more cautious than ever in his movements. He kept the\r\nyawl moving very slowly, and so silently that even the four boys who\r\nwere crouching in the bow could not detect the slightest splashing in\r\nthe water. In half an hour they came within sight of Bob's home, which\r\nwas shrouded in total darkness. In front of the cabin they saw the Go\r\nAhead No. 2 made fast to what the fisher-boy called his wharf, which\r\nwas nothing more nor less than a heavy stake driven into the sand. A\r\nfew more silent sweeps of the oar brought them to the beach, and Sam\r\nturned the yawl around until the stems of both boats were so close\r\ntogether that the boys could step from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jack Bennett,\" he whispered, \"make fast to the skiff. Bill\r\nStevens, jump ashore and cast off. Don't make too much noise.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys addressed began to bestir themselves, and, while Jack got\r\nout a rope with which to make fast to their prize, Bill climbed over\r\nthe stern of the yawl into the skiff, and thence to the shore, where\r\nhe discovered a difficulty at once: one end of a heavy chain was made\r\nfast to the skiff's bow by a staple, and the other was wound around the\r\nstake and confined by a padlock.\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" he whispered, \"she's chained up tighter'n a brick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull up the stake, then,\" replied Sam.\r\n\r\nBill did his best to obey this order, but the fisher-boy had put the\r\nstake there to stay, and he could not move it an inch.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, there,\" whispered the chief, impatiently, \"an' be careful\r\nhow you rattle that chain. If that ar Bobby Jennings should hear\r\nus\"----.\r\n\r\n\"Send more men ashore,\" interrupted Bill; \"it's a little bigger job\r\nthan I can do, all by myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe three boys who remained in the yawl were ordered out to Bill's\r\nassistance; but, for a long time, the post resisted their efforts, and\r\nremained firmly fixed in its bed. Finally, however, by pulling it first\r\none way, and then another, and scraping away the sand, they succeeded\r\nin loosening it, so that, by one united effort, they lifted it out and\r\nplaced it carefully in the skiff.\r\n\r\n\"All clear!\" whispered Bill; and, in a moment more, Crusoe and his men,\r\nwith their prize, had disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nANOTHER FAILURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the late hours they had kept the night before, Sam and his\r\nfour friends made their appearance in the harbor bright and early.\r\nThey were all in the best of spirits, for they believed that at last\r\nthey had succeeded in disposing of \"that ar Bobby Jennings;\" but still\r\nthey could not help casting frequent and anxious glances toward the\r\nbay, as if they every moment expected to see the fisher-boy sail into\r\nthe harbor in a boat as far superior to the Go Ahead No. 2 as she was\r\nbetter than the scow Sam had sunk the day before. The bully knew that\r\nhis rival had a great many friends, and he was afraid that, after\r\nall, he might be able to hold his own, in spite of all his efforts to\r\ndisable him. The fear of being punished for what they had done did not\r\ntrouble the members of the Crusoe band in the least; they knew that\r\ntheir chief had managed the affair so carefully that nothing could be\r\nproved against them.\r\n\r\nThe hours wore slowly away, and finally those of the ferry-boys\r\nwho knew nothing of what had taken place during the night began to\r\nmake inquiries concerning the fisher-boy, who was generally one of\r\nthe first to make his appearance in the harbor. No one had seen him\r\nthat morning, and it seemed to be the general impression that he was\r\nafraid to trust his fine boat among his rivals again--an idea that was\r\nconfirmed by Sam and all the members of his band.\r\n\r\n\"I've been a-lookin' an' waitin' fur him,\" said the bully, \"an' I'm\r\nmighty sorry he don't come, fur I've got a trick fixed fur him. I told\r\nhim we had seed him here jest often enough, an' may be he's goin' to\r\nquit ferryin'.\"\r\n\r\nSam would willingly have given every cent he expected to earn that day\r\nto know what Bob thought about it, and what he was going to do; and\r\nonce he even thought seriously of making some excuse for calling upon\r\nhim. But, upon reflection, he came to the conclusion that his safest\r\nplan was to keep away from his rival, and await the issue of events\r\nwith as much patience as he could command. He was not kept long in\r\nsuspense, however, for about ten o'clock he was given an opportunity\r\nto learn all he wanted to know. He was on the point of starting across\r\nthe harbor with a load of passengers, when the village constable,\r\naccompanied by the fisher-boy, suddenly appeared upon the wharf and\r\nordered him to stop.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the officer, addressing the passengers, \"you'll have\r\nto go across in some other boat. I want this ferry-boy.\"\r\n\r\nSam comprehended the situation in an instant; and he was smart\r\nenough to know that every thing depended upon the manner in which he\r\nbehaved himself during the next few minutes. He had all the while\r\nbeen satisfied that the fisher-boy would make a \"powerful fuss,\" as\r\nsoon as he discovered his loss, and Sam had so often gone over the\r\npart he intended to perform, that he could act it quite naturally.\r\nUpon hearing the words uttered by the constable, he looked up with an\r\nexpression of astonishment and alarm that would have staggered almost\r\nany one; and which went a long way toward convincing the officer that\r\nhe had got hold of the wrong man, and that he would be obliged to look\r\nfurther for the culprit.\r\n\r\n\"Come ashore with that boat, Sam,\" said the constable. \"I am in a great\r\nhurry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me, Mr. Grimes?\" asked the bully, with well-feigned\r\namazement. \"What have I been a doin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"No nonsense, now, but come ashore with that boat,\" repeated the\r\nofficer, sternly.\r\n\r\nSam did not carry matters too far, as a great many guilty boys would\r\nhave done, but without further parley, he brought his yawl alongside\r\nthe wharf, and assisted his passengers to climb out. Then turning\r\nto one of the ferry-boys, and requesting to keep an eye on his boat\r\nduring his absence, he clambered upon the wharf and stood before the\r\nconstable. The latter looked him squarely in the eye for a moment, as\r\nif trying to read his very thoughts, and then said, slowly:\r\n\r\n\"You're a nice boy, aint you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, why don't you tell me what I've been a doin'?\" asked Sam, never\r\nonce flinching before the officer's steady gaze. \"I haint been a doin'\r\nnothin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know better,\" said the constable, savagely. \"Where's that boat you\r\nstole from Bob Jennings last night? What have you done with it?\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this question, Sam stepped back as suddenly as if the\r\nconstable had aimed a blow at him, and, opening his eyes and puffing\r\nout his cheeks, he stood looking at the officer as if he could scarcely\r\nbelieve that he had heard aright. Then he turned and looked at Bob;\r\nand one short glance was sufficient to convince him that his last\r\nnight's work had ruined the fisher-boy as completely as he could have\r\ndesired. Bob's face was very pale, and wore such a hopeless, despairing\r\nexpression, that Sam could scarcely refrain from manifesting his\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, you needn't look so mightily astonished,\" said Mr. Grimes. \"I\r\nknow all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done with it?\" repeated Sam, as if he just began to\r\ncomprehend the officer's previous question. \"Why, Bobby, has somebody\r\nstole your skiff--that nice little craft of your'n, that new one?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's played out!\" said the constable. \"You're acting pretty well,\r\nSam, but you can't pull the wool over my eyes. I'm too old a hand at\r\nthis business, you know. If you won't tell me what you have done with\r\nthat boat, I'll take you before the 'squire, and have you put in jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"In jail!\" echoed Sam, now beginning to be really alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, in jail, in the lock-up, and from there to State's prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't help it,\" whined Sam, drawing down the corners of his\r\nmouth, and rubbing his knuckles in his eyes. \"I don't know nothing\r\nabout that ar boat! You don't 'spose I'd be mean enough to steal that\r\nnice little craft of your'n, do you, Bobby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" said the officer, without giving the fisher-boy\r\ntime to reply. \"I'll see if the 'squire can't find means to make you\r\ntell what we want to know. You might as well own up at once, and save\r\ntrouble! You didn't see me watching you last night, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No I didn't,\" replied Sam; \"an' I know you wasn't a watchin' me,\r\n'cause if you had been, you wouldn't arrest me now. You would know that\r\nI was in bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable was trying to frighten Sam into making a confession,\r\nbut he failed completely. On the way to the 'squire's office, the\r\nbully repeatedly protested his innocence; assured the officer that Bob\r\ncould not point to a firmer friend in the village than he had always\r\nshown himself to be, and he even had the impudence to appeal to the\r\nfisher-boy to substantiate all he said. But Bob declined to have any\r\nthing to say to him. He was as firmly convinced of Sam's guilt as if\r\nhe had seen him take the skiff; and he did not believe that a boy who\r\ncould deliberately perform so mean an act ought to be noticed by any\r\nrespectable person.\r\n\r\nSam had been arrested by the advice of Mr. Graves, to whom Bob had told\r\nhis story as soon as he discovered his loss. The boat-builder, being\r\nalarmed for the safety of his money, knowing, as he did, that Bob could\r\nnever raise the funds to pay off the note, unless he had a boat to earn\r\nit with, had interested himself in the case, and hired a lawyer to\r\nmanage it for him.\r\n\r\nThe affair having become noised abroad by this time, the court-room\r\nwas crowded, and when Sam was brought in by the constable, he had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing that he had very few friends among the\r\nspectators. Nearly every one had a kind word for the fisher-boy, while\r\nif they took any notice at all of Sam, it was only to scowl at him\r\nvery savagely. Tom Newcombe was there, and he was one of the first to\r\noffer consolation and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look so down-hearted, Bob,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" replied the fisher-boy, sorrowfully. \"I am utterly\r\nruined!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruined!\" repeated Tom, \"I can't see it. Have you forgotten the ten\r\ndollars we sent off yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but I am almost afraid it won't amount to any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Do you suppose that if there was any chance\r\nfor failure I would have invested my money in it? Let the skiff go. In\r\na week you will be able to buy a better one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Order in the court-room!\" commanded the 'squire, and this put a stop\r\nto the conversation.\r\n\r\nSam Barton seated himself on a table that stood in one corner of the\r\nroom, and settling into a comfortable position, patiently waited to\r\nhear what the judge had to say to him. A stranger would have thought\r\nhim a spectator rather than a prisoner. The air of solemnity with\r\nwhich every thing was conducted, and the look of sternness assumed by\r\nthe 'squire, did not trouble him in the least. Upon being questioned,\r\nhe declared himself innocent of the charge, and defied the constable,\r\nBob Jennings, or any body else, to prove that he had ever laid a hand\r\nupon the boat. Unfortunately for the fisher-boy, and the cause of\r\njustice, this was the difficulty; for what little evidence offered was\r\nall in Sam's favor. True, Bob repeated all the threats the bully had\r\nmade about driving him out of the harbor, and away from Fishertown,\r\nbut that did not prove that he had stolen the boat, for Sam's father\r\ntestified that his son was in bed and fast asleep at eight o'clock.\r\nThis convinced some of the spectators that Sam was innocent; for the\r\nfisher-boy said that he had seen the Go Ahead No. 2 lying safe at her\r\nwharf at nine o'clock. The truth of the matter was, that as late as\r\neleven, Sam Barton was wide awake and full of mischief, having never\r\nbeen near his bed that night. But Mr. Barton did not know this, and he\r\nhad told only what he believed to be the truth. Sam slept in a shed\r\nadjoining the house, and when he had any thing unusual on hand for the\r\nnight, he always made a great show of going to bed; and then, when\r\nevery thing was quiet, he would slip out and join his companions.\r\n\r\nThe culprit was cross-questioned by the lawyers for half an hour, but\r\nall to no purpose. He stoutly denied all knowledge of the boat, and,\r\nbesides, he could not be made to contradict himself. Finally, after\r\na long consultation with the constable and Mr. Graves, the 'squire\r\ndismissed him, telling him that he was satisfied, and that he was sorry\r\nto have caused him so much trouble.\r\n\r\n\"That's all mighty nice,\" said the bully, to himself, when he reached\r\nthe street. \"Mr. Grimes said I couldn't pull the wool over his eyes,\r\nan' I guess he'll find that he can't pull none over mine, neither. I'm\r\nsharper'n they think fur. I'll jest keep watch of that constable an'\r\nBobby Jennings, fur I know what they're up to as well as they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that we can't do any thing for you, Bob,\" said Mr. Graves,\r\nas soon as Sam had taken his departure.\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" replied the fisher-boy; \"but, after all, it might have been\r\nworse. I never allow a little thing like this to discourage me, and\r\nI'll soon show Sam Barton that it is not in his power to trouble me\r\nlong!\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was made in the presence of several persons, who had\r\nlingered about the court-room to talk the matter over, and there was\r\nnot one among them who did not believe that Bob was the spunkiest\r\nfellow he had ever seen. The fisher-boy's vanity was flattered by\r\nseveral remarks he happened to overhear; such as, \"You can't discourage\r\nhim. He will make his mark in the world one of these days!\" \"Yes,\" said\r\nanother, \"he is all grit. He will succeed in any thing he undertakes.\"\r\nNow, these men supposed that Bob was relying upon himself; but,\r\nhad they known any thing about the lottery, and been aware of the\r\nfact that it was his intention to wait for his twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars, before he made a single effort to extricate himself from his\r\ndifficulties, they might not have been so lavish in their praise.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two weeks there were three boys in the village who\r\nlived in a state of constant fear and excitement. Bob Jennings was\r\ntotally unfit for work; indeed, he grew more and more indolent every\r\nday he lived. He spent the most of his time in wandering about the\r\nwharves, watching Sam Barton, and living over, in imagination, the life\r\nhe intended to lead as soon as his fortune arrived. He was not half\r\nso much troubled by the loss of his fine skiff as by the fear that\r\nsomething would happen to destroy all his bright hopes. The letter,\r\nin which he had sent his money to those gentlemen in Baltimore, might\r\nmiscarry, or the whole thing might turn out to be a humbug, and then\r\nwhat would become of him? With a debt of twenty-six dollars hanging\r\nover him, with not a cent in his purse with which to supply his present\r\nnecessities, and without a boat to carry on his business, what could\r\nhe do? The fisher-boy would become frightened when he took this view\r\nof the situation, and then he would hunt up his friend Tom Newcombe,\r\nto make inquiries concerning the expected letter, and to listen to his\r\nwords of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it time that money was here?\" he would ask.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and I'm looking for a letter every day. But don't be in a hurry.\r\nThose gentlemen are, no doubt, full of business, and they will write to\r\nus just as soon as they can find the time.\"\r\n\r\nBob always departed satisfied, and with renewed hopes that in a day or\r\ntwo, at the very farthest, his bright dreams would all be realized.\r\n\r\nSam Barton was also in a fever of excitement. He was not ignorant of\r\nthe fact that every move he made, both night and day, was closely\r\nwatched by his rival, and it kept him in constant fear. Of course he\r\nwas obliged to give the cave a wide berth; but every night one of the\r\nmembers of the band visited their hiding-place, with provisions for the\r\ndog, and to stow away any new articles that were collected during the\r\nday. Their outfit was now complete, and some of the boys thought it\r\nhigh time they were beginning their cruise; but how should they elude\r\nthe vigilance of Bob Jennings? This question was discussed by the band\r\nevery day for two weeks, without reaching any satisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\nTom Newcombe was another very uneasy boy. He spent a small portion of\r\nhis time in attending to his business, and wasted many an hour in\r\nrunning to the post-office to make inquiries concerning the letter\r\nthat was to bring him a check for five thousand dollars. But the\r\npostmaster's invariable answer was--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for you yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, there ought to be,\" Tom would say. \"Please look again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father's box is empty,\" the postmaster would reply. \"If you are\r\nreally in want of a letter, and can not possibly do without it, I'll\r\nwrite you one myself.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever the postmaster said this, Tom would leave the office in a\r\nterrible rage. In fact, he was very cross at all times; and, if every\r\nthing did not work to his entire satisfaction, he would storm and scold\r\nat a great rate.\r\n\r\nFrom the post-office he would go to the ship-yard and look at his\r\nyacht. A strong force of men were at work upon her, and under their\r\nskillful hands Tom saw the little vessel grow into shape, until, at\r\nlast, he found before him what he considered to be the very perfection\r\nof marine architecture. He soon found that he was not the only one\r\nwho admired her, for the report having been circulated through the\r\nvillage that Mr. Graves was building the most magnificent little\r\nvessel that had ever been seen about Newport, crowds of boys visited\r\nthe ship-yard to satisfy themselves of the truth of the story. Johnny\r\nHarding, especially, spent an hour or two there every day, watching\r\nthe progress of the work, and trying in vain to ascertain who was to\r\nbe the happy owner of the yacht; but Mr. Graves never said any thing\r\non this point, for Tom thought it best to keep the affair very quiet;\r\nand Johnny, to his great disappointment, could learn nothing positive.\r\nHe had his suspicions, however, and, under the circumstances, that\r\nwas not to be wondered at. Every time he visited the yard, he saw Tom\r\nstrutting about, examining every thing with a critical eye, and the\r\nvery dignified manner in which he treated all his attempts to enter\r\ninto conversation with him convinced Johnny that there was \"something\r\nup.\" More than that, Tom could not help hinting, very mysteriously\r\nthat those of his acquaintances who had deserted him so shamefully\r\nwould soon have occasion to repent of what they had done; and Johnny\r\nwould have been dull indeed, if he had not been able to understand that\r\nsomething unusual was going on.\r\n\r\nThe nearer the yacht approached completion, the more impatient Tom\r\nbecame to receive some tidings from the gentlemen in Baltimore. Every\r\nmail that arrived found him at the post-office, from which he always\r\ncame away disappointed. He was becoming desperate. In a few more days\r\nthe Storm King would be ready for her trial trip, and then Mr. Graves\r\nwould want his money. If he did not have it ready for him--But Tom\r\nwould not allow himself to look upon the dark side of the picture,\r\nor to think of what would be the consequences if his prize did not\r\narrive in time to enable him to keep the promise he had made to the\r\nboat-builder. With his usual obstinacy, he clung to the belief that he\r\nhad found the road to fortune, and that the \"something,\" which he had\r\nwaited for so long had at last \"turned up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid we are in a bad scrape!\" said the fisher-boy to him,\r\none day. \"I don't believe those men are honest. Your father doesn't\r\ngenerally allow business letters to go unanswered for two or three\r\nweeks, does he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no!\" replied Tom. \"But, then, you see his business is not so\r\nextensive as that of the men in Baltimore. Just think what an army of\r\nagents they must have; and how many letters they must receive every\r\nday! I'll drop them a line, requesting them to hurry up.\"\r\n\r\nTom went to work at once, and that same evening a long letter\r\nwas dispatched to the proprietors of the lottery, containing the\r\ninformation that Tom had sent them ten dollars for the lucky package\r\nof tickets that was to draw a prize of five thousand dollars over and\r\nabove all expenses, and that he would be greatly obliged to them if\r\nthey would send on the money at once. He further informed them that\r\nthey were losing a great deal of business by their delay; but that was\r\nsomething he could not help, for he could not begin to act as their\r\nagent until he should be able to show the prize.\r\n\r\nThis letter was sent off on Saturday. On the Monday following, Mr.\r\nGraves came to the office, when Tom, for a wonder, happened to be at\r\nwork, and beckoned him out.\r\n\r\n\"The Storm King will be ready for sea one week from to-day,\" said he,\r\n\"and I would like to know if you intend to invite any of your friends\r\nto accompany you on the trial trip; if you do, I'll see that the\r\nprovisions are supplied for the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no,\" replied Tom, quickly. \"I have my reasons for wishing to keep\r\nthe whole thing a secret for a few days longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know but your father might want to see the boat before he\r\nbuys her,\" began Mr. Graves.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, never mind my father,\" drawled Tom. \"He's got nothing to do\r\nwith it! I am bossing this job myself! When the yacht is ready for\r\nsea, you can man her with a crew of your own, and I'll go with you to\r\nsee how she behaves. If she suits me, I'll pay you for her and take\r\ncharge of her at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I know you will be pleased with her,\" said the boat-builder. \"She\r\nis the finest little craft about the village, if I do say it myself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves went back to his ship-yard, and Tom slowly and thoughtfully\r\nreturned to the office. He was a good deal annoyed to learn that\r\nhis father had watched him very closely while he was talking to the\r\nboat-builder. He looked at Tom curiously as he came in, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You and Mr. Graves are getting to be great friends lately. What is\r\ngoing on?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, nothing particular!\" drawled Tom, in reply. \"I was talking to him\r\nabout a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you have had enough to do with boats,\" said the merchant. \"It\r\nis time you were turning a little of your attention to something more\r\nprofitable, if you ever intend to be any body in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, that's always the way!\" muttered Tom, as he seated himself at\r\nhis desk. \"I always was the most unlucky boy in the whole world. Every\r\nthing I do is foolish and unprofitable. But just wait until the Storm\r\nKing is paid for, and I'll show father that some folks can make money\r\nas well as others.\"\r\n\r\nFour days more passed, and Tom's nervousness increased to such a degree\r\nthat it began to attract the attention of Mr. Newcombe, who wondered if\r\nthe confinement of the office was not injuring his son's health. Bob\r\nJennings was in much the same predicament; and on Friday evening he\r\ncame to Tom with a very long face, and told him that the last cent of\r\nhis ten dollars had been used to feed the family, and that if the prize\r\ndid not arrive that night he would be utterly ruined; no provisions on\r\nhand, and no boat with which to earn money to buy any.\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't talk about being ruined,\" said Tom, impatiently. \"You're\r\nalways croaking, and I can't see the use of it. We'll get a letter this\r\nvery night. It _must_ come; because when those gentlemen in Baltimore\r\nfind out that they are losing business every day by neglecting us, they\r\nwill begin to bestir themselves.\"\r\n\r\nFour o'clock, the hour at which the evening mail arrived, found them\r\nat the post-office; and to their intense delight the postmaster handed\r\nout the long expected letter. Tom knew it was the one he wanted, for\r\nhe could see that it had been mailed at Baltimore. He could not speak,\r\nfor his heart was too full for utterance; but he gave Bob a knowing\r\nwink, and started for the wharf on a keen run. As he was passing by the\r\nship-yard, he ran against Mr. Graves.\r\n\r\n\"How's the yacht?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Finished from main truck to kelson,\" was the reply. \"I am two days\r\nahead of time. You can go to sea in her to-morrow if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" answered Tom. \"You may expect me at nine o'clock. I've\r\ngot your money in my pocket.\" Tom being in a great hurry to read his\r\nletter, left Mr. Graves very unceremoniously, and kept on to the wharf,\r\nfollowed by the fisher-boy, who now looked more like the Bob Jennings\r\nof old than he had done for many a day.\r\n\r\nTom never once slackened his pace until he reached an unfrequented\r\npart of the wharf, where he sat down and pulled the letter out of his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you, Bob?\" he asked, in a husky whisper, for he was so\r\nexcited that he could scarcely speak plainly. \"Here's our fortune at\r\nlast. You are not sorry now that you risked your five dollars, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" replied Bob, in the same excited whisper. \"I'm glad of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It takes me to get up schemes, don't it?\" continued Tom. \"Now, there\r\nisn't another boy in Newport who would have thought of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the letter,\" interrupted Bob; \"I am in a great hurry to see that\r\nmoney!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you open it,\" replied Tom, handing the letter to the fisher-boy,\r\nand throwing himself at full length on the wharf. \"I can enjoy it so\r\nmuch better if you read it.\" Bob tore open the envelope, and took out\r\nthe letter, expecting, of course, that the first thing that met his eye\r\nwould be the check for five thousand dollars. But to his astonishment,\r\nno such document appeared. A few words were scrawled upon half a sheet\r\nof soiled note paper, and Bob read them aloud, as follows:\r\n\r\n We have made every effort to ascertain the whereabouts of your letter\r\n containing the ten dollars, but without success. We are sorry to say\r\n that it has, no doubt, miscarried.\r\n\r\n Send on ten dollars more for the lucky package.\r\n\r\nTom started up and looked at Bob without speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTOM'S NEW YACHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad a thunderbolt fallen upon the wharf and burst at their very feet,\r\nTom could not have been more astonished than he was when these words\r\nfell upon his ear. A great lump seemed to be rising up in his throat,\r\nhis eyes were blinded with tears he could not choke back, and it was\r\nonly after a desperate effort that he recovered the use of his tongue.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, Bob, you haven't read that letter right,\" he almost gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have!\" replied the fisher-boy, whose amazement and\r\nconsternation were fully equal to Tom's. \"I read every word of it just\r\nas it is written. Here's the letter; read it yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I won't do it!\" drawled Tom, who, suddenly losing all his\r\nself-control, and forgetting, in his excitement, that people were\r\nconstantly passing up and down the wharf in plain view, threw himself\r\nspitefully down upon the boards and cried aloud.\r\n\r\n\"I always was the most unlucky boy in the whole world!\" he sobbed, \"and\r\nsomething is always happening to bother me. I never can do any thing\r\nlike other fellows. I knew all the time just how it would turn out!\"\r\n\r\n\"You did!\" exclaimed Bob. \"Then why did you urge me to spend my money\r\nso foolishly?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I don't know!\" Tom almost yelled. \"I'll jump in the harbor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so loud,\" said the fisher-boy, who, although quite as much\r\naffected as Tom, succeeded in controlling himself. \"There are some men\r\nlooking at us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care!\" replied Tom, recklessly. \"It will be all over the\r\nvillage by this time to-morrow. I've been the biggest kind of a dunce!\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I, in more ways than one. I'm ruined now, and I have a good\r\nmind to jump into the harbor myself. Here's your letter!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I don't want to see it! Take it away! Throw it overboard! Tear\r\nit up!\" cried Tom, his tears bursting out afresh. \"I wish I had ten\r\ndollars more, to send on for that lucky package.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would only be money wasted,\" said Bob. \"The whole thing is a\r\nhumbug!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know better,\" shouted Tom. \"You'll never be a rich man so long as\r\nyou allow your doubts to stand in your way. What will all the fellows\r\nsay when they find out that I ordered that splendid little yacht, and\r\nthen couldn't pay for her?\"\r\n\r\nTom cried harder than ever as he asked this question, which excited a\r\nserious train of reflections in the mind of the fisher-boy. What would\r\nhis mother say to him when she learned that he had squandered five\r\ndollars of his money, and told her a falsehood besides?\r\n\r\n\"O, get away from me, now, Bob Jennings!\" roared Tom, whose\r\ndisappointment seemed to have turned his brain. \"I don't want you or\r\nany body else near me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good by!\" said the fisher-boy. \"If you are going to keep up that\r\nhowling you had better get away from here yourself. You'll raise the\r\ntown in five minutes more!\"\r\n\r\nAs Bob spoke he gave one more glance at the letter which, from the very\r\npinnacle of hope and joy, had plunged them into the lowest depths of\r\ndespair, and then walked slowly away.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two boys was in an enviable position just then; but\r\nbad as was Tom's condition, the fisher-boy's was infinitely worse.\r\nDeeply in debt, his boat and money gone, the family entirely destitute\r\nof provisions, it was no wonder that Bob thought his lot in life a\r\nhard one, and that he should feel utterly discouraged. It seemed to\r\nhim that the last three weeks of his life had been a dream. It had\r\ncertainly been a pleasant one, for he had lived in a little world of\r\nhis own creation, and had been free from all cares and troubles. The\r\nloss of his fine skiff--a misfortune which, had he been in his sober\r\nsenses, would have alarmed him--he had regarded as something scarcely\r\nworth thinking about. He had been so fully occupied in contemplating\r\nthe bright future which his imagination had pictured for him, that\r\nmatters to which he should have given his immediate attention were\r\ndeemed unworthy of notice. But just when he imagined himself on the\r\neve of seeing all his glorious anticipations realized, he had been\r\nsuddenly and rudely awakened, only to find himself still a fisher-boy,\r\nand, what was worse, the poorest one in the village. He had good reason\r\nfor feeling down-hearted. The failure of Tom's splendid scheme was a\r\nserious matter for him, and it was a long time before he could recover\r\nfrom the shock which the reading of the letter had given him. For two\r\nor three hours he walked listlessly about, scarcely knowing where he\r\nwas, or what he was doing, and it was not until it began to grow dark,\r\nand the wharves were deserted, that he was able to muster up courage\r\nenough to think the matter over calmly.\r\n\r\nHis disappointment, although he thought it a very severe blow, was\r\njust what he needed. It did away with his delusion and his ideas about\r\nacquiring riches without labor, destroyed every one of the foolish\r\nnotions Tom had put into his head, and, from that hour, Bob Jennings\r\nwas himself again. He knew that, before he made any attempt to get out\r\nof his difficulties, he ought to try to make some amends for what he\r\nhad done. He knew, also, right where he ought to begin; and, better\r\nthan all, he had the moral courage to do what he believed to be right\r\nin the matter. He went home at a more rapid pace than he had exhibited\r\nfor many a day, and found his mother engaged in sewing by the light of\r\na solitary candle.\r\n\r\nWhile Bob had been idling away his time, and waiting for fortune to\r\ncome to him, she had worked early and late to earn the money to buy the\r\nfood he ate. She had used very sparingly of his little fortune, never\r\nspending a cent of it unless it was absolutely necessary, while he had,\r\nat one time, deliberately thrown away five dollars of it; or, what was\r\nthe same thing, given it to support a couple of professional swindlers\r\nin their idleness.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not waste time in thinking how he ought to begin the\r\nconversation, for a single glance at his mother's pale, patient face\r\nmade the load on his conscience heavier than ever, and he was anxious\r\nto get rid of it as soon as possible. With tears of genuine repentance,\r\nand repeated promises of amendment, Bob told the story of his mistake,\r\nand of the deception of which he had been guilty. He did not try to\r\ndefend himself by making excuses, but was manly enough to make a clean\r\nbreast of the whole matter; he freely confessed his fault, and begged\r\nher forgiveness. Then he felt a great deal better; and, for the first\r\ntime in three weeks, he was able to look his mother in the face. During\r\nthose weeks of inactivity she had had no word of fault to find with\r\nBob, and she had none now; but she had some good advice to give him,\r\nand the fisher-boy, having been thoroughly convinced by his recent\r\nexperience that his mother's knowledge of the world was superior to his\r\nown, listened attentively to every word of it, and mentally resolved\r\nthat he would never take a step in any direction without first asking\r\nher permission and advice.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight before the conversation ceased, and Bob, who did not\r\nfeel at all sleepy just then, took a sharp-pointed case-knife from the\r\ncupboard and went out. He walked around behind the house, and by the\r\nlight of the moon, which was shining brightly, read over his motto.\r\n\"I'll never forget it again,\" said he. \"If I had only been wise enough\r\nto keep it in mind, I never would have been in this miserable scrape.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given utterance to this opinion, Bob went to work with his\r\nknife, and at the end of an hour, another motto had been cut in the\r\nboards under the first. He then went to bed, well satisfied with what\r\nhe had done, and believing that he had taken the first step toward\r\nextricating himself from his difficulties. The next morning he was up\r\nwith the sun, and, shouldering a saw-horse, he set out for Mr. Henry's\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n\"Have you hired a man to saw that wood?\" he asked of the grocer.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply, and it sent a thrill of gladness through the heart\r\nof the fisher-boy. \"If you want the job, I'll give you seventy-five\r\ncents a cord for sawing and splitting it.\"\r\n\r\nBob accepted the offer, and in five minutes more, he had begun the work\r\nof retrieving his fortune.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tom Newcombe was stepping gayly about the office, performing\r\nhis duties with more than usual alacrity; and one, to have seen him,\r\nwould have little imagined that he had passed the most miserable night\r\nof his existence. He had never once closed his eyes in sleep; for,\r\nwhile he tossed uneasily about on his bed, he kept his brain busy\r\ntrying to study up some plan to get himself out of his troubles. He\r\ncould not bear the thought of giving up that splendid little vessel,\r\nafter she had been built according to his orders, and he had so\r\nfaithfully promised to be on hand with the money as soon as she was\r\ncompleted. He had so confidently expected to own and sail her himself,\r\nthat he was sure that it would be a death-blow to him if he should see\r\nher pass into the possession of any one else. He knew that the matter\r\ncould not be kept a secret much longer, for when Mr. Graves found out\r\nthat he had no money to pay for the yacht, he would very likely take\r\nthe trouble to call upon Mr. Newcombe. That would be a calamity indeed;\r\nfor Tom knew that if the facts of the case came to his father's ears,\r\nhe might bid good-by to all hopes of ever owning the vessel. He had\r\nbelieved that his twenty-five hundred dollars would come to hand so\r\nthat he could settle with the boat-builder before his father should\r\nhear of what was going on; and, possession being nine points of law,\r\nhe hoped that the merchant would raise no objection to his keeping the\r\nStorm King. But he had been disappointed in receiving the prize, and\r\nnow he was trying to decide upon some plan to raise the four hundred\r\ndollars, or, at least, to secure possession of the vessel. This was,\r\nby far, the most difficult task he had yet undertaken; and for a long\r\ntime it proved to be more than he could manage. But Tom was fruitful\r\nin expedients, and about midnight he suddenly sprung up in his bed and\r\nclapped his hands for joy. He had at last discovered a way out of his\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" said Tom to himself, after he had thought the matter over.\r\n\"I'll have that yacht yet! It takes just me to get up schemes. I'm all\r\nright, and now I'll go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nBut that was easier said than done. He was intensely excited over his\r\nnew project, and it kept him as wide-awake as his trouble had done\r\nbefore. Contrary to his usual custom he answered the breakfast bell\r\npromptly, and, in spite of the sleepless night he had passed, appeared\r\nat the table as bright as a lark. After eating a very light breakfast,\r\nhe went down to the office, where he performed his duties in a very\r\nshort space of time. Then he caught up his cap and ran out upon the\r\nwharf, where he found the fisher-boy at work at his wood-pile.\r\n\r\n\"You're just the very man I am looking for!\" said Tom. \"Quit that job\r\nand come with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up now?\" asked Bob. \"You seem to be in good spirits this\r\nmorning!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say I was!\" replied Tom, snapping his fingers, and stepping\r\ngayly about the wharf; \"and why shouldn't I be? We are all right now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we?\" exclaimed Bob, eagerly. \"Has our money come, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet! I'm going to send for it again in a week or two. But I\r\nown the Storm King, Bob! That's one settled fact!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do! Have you raised the four hundred dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my business! I've got her; she belongs to me, individually; and\r\nnow I want to hire a crew. Will you ship as first mate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not!\" said the fisher-boy, shaking his head, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"What's the reason? I'll give you a dollar a day, and I know that's\r\nmore than you can make by sawing wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has your father bought--\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, never mind talking about my father!\" drawled Tom, impatiently.\r\n\"It is enough for you to know that the yacht is mine, and that I am\r\nable to hire you. Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I think I had better stay ashore!\" said the fisher-boy. \"You're\r\na regular Jonah, Tom, and, to tell the truth, I am afraid of you. I\r\nwonder that they didn't have to throw you overboard from the Savannah\r\nwhen you made your voyage to Callao.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, look here, Bob Jennings!\" whined Tom, \"I want you to quit\r\ncalling me a Jonah! If you are afraid to ship with me, I can find some\r\none else. I have tried to help you along in the world, but I'll never\r\nmake you another offer as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned angrily on his heel and left the fisher-boy, who\r\nagain turned his attention to his wood-pile. Tom bent his steps toward\r\nMr. Graves's ship-yard, and the first thing he saw, as he entered the\r\ngate, was the Storm King, riding proudly at her moorings in the harbor,\r\nwith her sails hoisted, all ready for the start. Three or four men, who\r\ncomprised the crew that was to manage her during the trial trip, were\r\nlounging about the decks, and Mr. Graves stood on the beach talking\r\nto a crowd of eager, excited boys, who were examining the yacht with\r\ncritical eyes, and begging the boat-builder to reveal to them the name\r\nof the owner. Although Tom could not hear what was said, he had no\r\ndifficulty in guessing the subject of the conversation, and his heart\r\nswelled high within him when he thought what a commotion would be\r\noccasioned in that crowd of boys, when it became known that he was the\r\ncaptain and owner. Drawing himself up to his full height, throwing back\r\nhis shoulders, and assuming what he considered to be a very commanding\r\nair, he walked leisurely down to the beach. The boys, seeing him\r\napproach, made way for him, and Mr. Graves called out:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, captain! We are all ready, as you see.\"\r\n\r\nSince the vessel was completed and ready for sea, the boat-builder\r\nthought there was no further necessity for keeping the affair a secret.\r\nIf Tom wanted to create a sensation what better chance could he have?\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" chorused all the boys, crowding up around Tom. \"Do you own\r\nthat beautiful yacht, Newcombe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do!\" was the very dignified reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're a lucky fellow,\" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n\"You've got the best father in the world!\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready, captain?\" asked Mr. Graves, stepping into a skiff and\r\npicking up the oars. \"If you are, we'll go aboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to sea, Newcombe?\" eagerly inquired a dozen boys. \"Let\r\nus go with you!\"\r\n\r\nTom's time for revenge had come at last. There were, perhaps, thirty\r\nor forty boys present, a good portion of whom had belonged to the\r\nNight-hawks, and the remainder were \"Spooneys,\" with whom he never\r\nassociated. He had several times run his eye over the group, but he\r\ncould not discover a single friend in it. Every one of the boys, at\r\nsome time or other, had failed to treat him with the respect due\r\nthe son of the wealthiest man in the village, and now Tom had an\r\nopportunity to show them that he had not forgotten it. Without taking\r\nthe trouble to reply to their request, he jumped into the skiff, turned\r\nhis back to the boys, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Shove off, Mr. Graves!\"\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder pushed off from the beach, and Tom, whose whole soul\r\nwas wrapped up in his beautiful craft, did not even condescend to cast\r\na parting glance toward the crowd of boys behind him.\r\n\r\nA few strokes of the oars brought the skiff alongside the Storm King,\r\nand the men who were lounging about the decks, arose to their feet and\r\nsaluted Tom as he clambered over the side.\r\n\r\n\"Here she is!\" exclaimed Mr. Graves, who had followed close behind Tom.\r\n\"Now, will you take command?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I believe not,\" replied the boy, stroking his chin and gazing\r\nabout him with the air of one who considered himself a judge of a good\r\nboat. \"She doesn't belong to me yet, so you may just consider me a\r\nvisitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied the boat-builder. \"I thought, perhaps you would be\r\nimpatient to get control of her. When I was a boy of your age, I never\r\nallowed a chance to play captain pass unimproved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you were not as reckless as I am,\" said Tom, who could think\r\nof no other excuse to make for not wishing to take charge of the little\r\nvessel. \"I am a great hand to carry sails, and I might lose this mast\r\noverboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be captain then,\" said Mr. Graves. \"All hands stand by to\r\nget ship under-way.\"\r\n\r\nAs the sails were all spread, the work of getting under-way was very\r\nspeedily accomplished. One of the crew took his place at the wheel,\r\nanother cast off the line with which she was made fast, and in half a\r\nminute's time the Storm King was moving down the harbor.\r\n\r\nOne thing that not a little astonished Tom was, the perfect cloud of\r\ncanvas he saw above him. He had told Mr. Graves that he wanted his\r\nyacht to have all the sail she could carry; and, according to Tom's\r\nidea, she was supplied with a great deal more than could be spread with\r\nsafety even in the lightest breeze. But Mr. Graves thought differently.\r\nHe had hoisted every inch of the canvas, and Tom's amazement increased\r\nwhen he witnessed the exhibition of speed the little vessel made. He\r\nwas not the only one who was astonished, for the yacht very soon began\r\nto attract the attention of the people on both sides of the harbor, who\r\nshouted and waved their hats as she dashed by. Tom kept watch for the\r\nfisher-boy, and presently discovered him standing upon the top of his\r\nwood-pile, where he had climbed to obtain a better view of the boat.\r\nTom knew he was astonished, and he wished that he could have been near\r\nenough to hear what he had to say about it; but when Bob waved his hat\r\nto him, he turned and walked over to the other side of the vessel. He\r\ncould not forget that the fisher-boy had called him a Jonah.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes the yacht cleared the harbor and entered the bay.\r\nThere she felt the full force of the wind, which was blowing briskly,\r\nand, like an unruly horse which takes the bits in his teeth and runs\r\naway, the Storm King seemed determined to escape from the control of\r\nher crew, or, failing in that, to sweep them from her deck by running\r\nentirely under the water. In fact, she went at such a rate that Tom\r\nbegan to be alarmed, and nervously asked Mr. Graves if he hadn't better\r\nshorten sail.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" was the reply. \"This is delightful. Besides, she is a new\r\ncraft, and I want to find out what she can do. I should think an old\r\nsailor like you would enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I do!\" answered Tom, clinging to the rail for support; \"but she\r\nmight carry away her mast, or something, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll risk that! Every thing about her was made at my ship-yard, and I\r\nknow it is first-class.\"\r\n\r\nTom tried hard to bring himself to believe that there was no danger,\r\nbut the sloop careened so wildly, and threw the spray about so\r\nrecklessly, that it terrified him, and, to save his life, he could not\r\nconceal the fact.\r\n\r\nIn order to thoroughly test the qualities of the yacht, Mr. Graves put\r\nher through a variety of evolutions, he sailed before the wind, beat up\r\nagainst, and finally declared that he could make her run square into\r\nthe wind's eye. She behaved splendidly in every instance; and Tom was\r\nseaman enough to know that she was a prize, and that the happy owner of\r\nher would be envied by every boy in the village. Her sailing qualities,\r\nhowever, were not her only attractions, as Tom discovered when Mr.\r\nGraves conducted him down the companion-ladder into the cabin. He was\r\nmore amazed then ever at the scene presented to his view; and, indeed,\r\nthat was not to be wondered at, for the little cabin was fitted up like\r\na palace. The bulkheads were finished off with black walnut, the floor\r\nwas carpeted, and the furniture was as fine as any in Mr. Newcombe's\r\nparlors. There were two small windows in the stern, and under them was\r\na sofa where the captain might lie down and take his after-dinner nap.\r\nAt the head of the sofa was a desk, which Tom found to be supplied with\r\nwriting materials of every description, and on a small table, that\r\nstood in the middle of the cabin, were one or two charts (which would\r\nhave been of no possible use to Tom), a spy-glass, and several books\r\nand papers. On each side of the cabin a door opened into the cosiest\r\nlittle state-rooms that Tom had ever seen. They were both of the same\r\nsize, nicely furnished, and supplied with beds, wash-stands, and\r\nlooking-glasses.\r\n\r\nAfter Tom had examined every thing in them to his satisfaction, Mr.\r\nGraves conducted him through a door that led from the cabin into\r\nthe hold. It was dry and airy, and large enough to contain all the\r\nmerchandise that Tom was likely to put into it. From the hold they\r\nwent into the galley, which was furnished with a small stove, and with\r\nall the pots, pans, and kettles, that any cook could possibly find\r\nuse for. Tom was delighted with every thing he saw, but, after all,\r\nhe did not look much like a boy who expected soon to be the owner of\r\nthe finest little yacht about the village. Indeed, he was by no means\r\ncertain that she would ever belong to him; for, while Mr. Graves was\r\nconducting him about the vessel, and explaining every thing to him, he\r\nkept saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I wonder if I shall ever be captain of this boat! What shall I\r\ndo if my new plan fails?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTOM LOSES A DINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, of course, did not believe that his plan for obtaining possession\r\nof the yacht would prove unsuccessful, but still he felt rather anxious\r\nabout it, for the failure of his lottery scheme had made him timid. Mr.\r\nGraves noticed that there was something wrong with him, and as they\r\nascended to the deck he inquired:\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you? If I was in your place, and knew that I\r\nwas soon to be the owner of this fine little vessel, I'd be livelier\r\nthan you are! Are you sea-sick?\"\r\n\r\nTom thought this as good an opportunity as he should have to try his\r\nnew plan; so he summoned all his courage to his aid, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"O, no! It is something worse than that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than sea-sickness!\" repeated Mr. Graves. \"Then it must be\r\nsomething bad. You have nothing to trouble you!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, yes I have!\" drawled Tom. \"I've seen more trouble than any\r\nother boy in the whole world!\"\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder looked at Tom a moment, to see if he was really in\r\nearnest, and then burst into a loud laugh. \"Why, what have you to worry\r\nabout?\" he asked. \"You have no hard work to do, like many boys of your\r\nage in the village; you have a rich father who gives you every thing\r\nyou want; you live in a fine house; you own the prettiest little pony\r\nin the country, and, besides, you are master of a vessel that can't be\r\nbeaten by any thing of her size in America. I think your lot in life a\r\nvery pleasant one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my disappointments as well as other people,\" said Tom, leading\r\nMr. Graves out of ear-shot of the man at the wheel. \"You know I told\r\nyou last night that I had your money in my pocket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I recollect!\" said the boat-builder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was mistaken!\" said Tom, in a low voice, turning away his head\r\nto hide the tears that started to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You were mistaken!\" repeated Mr. Graves, who little imagined what Tom\r\nwas trying to get at.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I haven't got a red cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, is that the cause of your trouble?\" asked the boat-builder, with\r\nanother laugh. \"That is very easily got over. Go to your father and ask\r\nhim for seventy-five cents, or a dollar, and, if he thinks you need it,\r\nI know you'll get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I want more than that!\" drawled Tom. \"A dollar would be of no\r\nuse to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has all this got to do with the Storm King?\" asked Mr. Graves.\r\n\r\n\"It's got a great deal to do with it. I can't own the sloop till I pay\r\nfor her, can I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how can I pay for her without money? I am dead broke!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves threw back his head, looked up at the cross-trees, and\r\nlaughed louder than ever. \"That's a good one!\" said he. \"Your father, a\r\nman who owns three-fourths of all the vessels that sail from this port,\r\nis out of money! Who ever heard of such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, who said any thing about my father?\" drawled Tom. \"I was\r\ntalking about myself! I didn't mention his name!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see the point!\" said the boat-builder, who had all the while\r\nbeen under the impression that Tom had ordered the Storm King with his\r\nfather's permission, and that when she was completed the merchant would\r\nbe the one to settle the bill. \"I don't know what you mean!\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean just what I say!\" replied Tom, beginning to believe that Mr.\r\nGraves was very dull of comprehension. \"I mean that I have no money to\r\npay for the yacht now; but, if you will let me have her, I'll settle\r\nwith you in two or three weeks. I'll give you my note to that effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, that's the trouble, is it?\" said Mr. Graves, who appeared to be\r\nhighly amused. \"Don't let it bother you any longer. I can wait!\"\r\n\r\nTom could scarcely believe his ears. He sprang down from the rail where\r\nhe had been sitting, and seizing Mr. Graves by both hands he danced\r\nabout over the deck like one demented.\r\n\r\n\"You are the best man I ever saw,\" said he, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\"I'll never forget your kindness, and I hope that I shall some day be\r\nable to repay it! Just think of it! I am master of this magnificent\r\nvessel! If you have no objections, I'll take command of her now!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" exclaimed Mr. Graves, who appeared to be quite as much\r\nexcited as Tom himself. \"You be captain, and I'll be first-mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" said Tom, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and\r\ntaking a few turns across the deck. \"Mr. Graves, we will extend our\r\ncruise around Block Island. Shake out that gaff-topsail, and hoist the\r\nflying-jib, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\" replied the first-mate. \"And then, with your permission,\r\nI will order dinner. I am hungry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves, having tested the sloop to his satisfaction, had shaped\r\nher course toward the village; and, as the breeze was freshening,\r\nhad ordered some of the sails taken in. But, upon receiving Tom's\r\ninstructions, he put the vessel about, the flying-jib and gaff-topsail\r\nwere given to the wind, and the Storm King began her cruise around the\r\nisland. Then he returned to Tom, who was pacing up and down the deck,\r\nto report that his orders had been obeyed, and that dinner would be\r\nready in half an hour. The new captain was in ecstasies, and he found\r\nit all he could do to refrain from shouting. When the boat-builder came\r\nup, he again seized him by the hand, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"I knew all the time that this yacht would belong to me! Won't the boys\r\nin the village be astonished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly they will,\" said Mr. Graves, \"and every one of them will\r\nwish themselves in your boots!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are really willing to take my note!\" said Tom, who found\r\nit difficult to believe that one of his glorious plans had proved a\r\nsuccess. \"You are not afraid to trust me for a short time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not! Why should I be when I know that the money is as safe\r\nin your hands as it is in my own? Have your note indorsed by your\r\nfather, and I'll wait until----Why, what's the matter now?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Tom's bright hopes were dashed to the ground. Rudely jerking his\r\nhand from the boat-builder's grasp, he staggered back against the rail,\r\nand drawled out:\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I didn't say any thing about my father, I tell you! He's got\r\nnothing whatever to do with this business!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that you say?\" exclaimed Mr. Graves, who now thought that he\r\nbegan to understand the matter.\r\n\r\n\"I say that my father has nothing to do with this boat,\" repeated Tom,\r\npulling his handkerchief out of his pocket, and wiping the tears from\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Then who is to pay for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, myself, individually, and nobody else!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" whistled Mr. Graves, growing more and more astonished. \"Where\r\ndo you expect to get four hundred dollars, if your father doesn't give\r\nit to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my own business! I'll have it in a very short time, and I'll\r\nget it honestly, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your father doesn't know any thing about this business?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, he doesn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you had the assurance to order me to build you a boat worth four\r\nhundred dollars without first consulting him?\" continued Mr. Graves.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did!\" answered Tom; \"and if you will let me have her, I will\r\ncertainly pay for her in two or three weeks! I sent for the money\r\nseveral days ago, but it hasn't come yet.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves had never been more astonished in his life. He looked at his\r\ncustomer as if he could hardly believe that he had told him the truth,\r\nand finally inquired--\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a boy are you, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm the most unlucky boy in the whole world! That's the kind of a\r\nboy I am!\" drawled Tom. \"I never can do any thing like other fellows,\r\nfor something is always happening to bother me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you can do a good many things that other fellows can't do!\"\r\nreturned Mr. Graves. \"There is not another boy in the village who would\r\nhave the impudence to do as you have done.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boat-builder said this, he turned on his heel and left Tom to\r\nthink the matter over at his leisure. He gave a few orders in a low\r\ntone to the man at the wheel, and then walked forward and descended\r\ninto the galley. Presently he came out again, gave some instructions\r\nto his crew, and Tom saw the sloop slowly come about until her bow\r\npointed toward the village. The sails which Captain Newcombe had\r\nordered spread, were taken in again, and then Mr. Graves began to pace\r\nthoughtfully up and down the deck.\r\n\r\nTom watched all these movements as well as he could through eyes\r\nfilled with tears of vexation and disappointment, and they told him,\r\nin language too plain to be misunderstood, that his new plan, which,\r\nat first, had promised to succeed even beyond his expectations, had\r\nfailed like all the rest of his glorious ideas. He felt like yelling;\r\nand, perhaps he would thus have given vent to his troubled feelings\r\nif the presence of Mr. Graves and his crew had not restrained him. He\r\nwanted to hide his emotion from them, so he leaned over the rail and\r\nlooked down into the water. He would have gone into the cabin, but the\r\nboat-builder evidently intended to keep him out of there, for he had\r\nlocked the door and put the key into his pocket.\r\n\r\nPoor Tom was in a terrible predicament. Aside from the troubles\r\noccasioned by the non-receipt of his twenty-five hundred dollars, and\r\nthe failure of his new plan to obtain possession of the yacht--both of\r\nwhich were very severe blows to him--he had the satisfaction of knowing\r\nthat the very dignified manner in which he had conducted himself in\r\nthe morning, when he believed himself to be the owner of the Storm\r\nKing, had made him a great many enemies among the village boys, who,\r\nwhen they learned all the particulars of his business transaction with\r\nMr. Graves, would never allow him to hear the last of it. He knew just\r\nwhat was in store for him, for he had already had some very bitter\r\nexperience in that line. When the secrets of the \"Gentlemen's Club\"\r\nwere revealed to the world, Tom had been tormented almost beyond the\r\nbounds of endurance; for every \"Spooney\" who met him on the street\r\nwould raise his hat and politely make inquiries concerning the health\r\nof the President, and the prosperity of his society. Now, if such a\r\nthing was possible, matters would be tenfold worse. He would be known\r\nthroughout the village as Captain Newcombe, and every one of his\r\nacquaintances, especially Johnny Harding, the boy with whom Tom was\r\nparticularly desirous to \"get even,\" would want to know something about\r\nhis fine yacht. They would be very anxious to learn how she sailed,\r\nand would write notes to him requesting the privilege of accompanying\r\nhim on some of his excursions. The affair would soon be known by every\r\nman, woman, and child in the village--he could see no way to prevent\r\nit--and every body would laugh at him, and wonder why he did not ask\r\nhis father's permission before he ordered the yacht, and where he\r\nintended to get the money to pay for her. In short, Tom was afraid that\r\nduring the next six or eight months, Newport would be a very unpleasant\r\nplace to live, and he forthwith set his wits at work to conjure up some\r\nplan to get out of it.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking the matter over, the sloop was rapidly\r\napproaching the village, and presently Tom looked up and found that she\r\nwas entering the harbor. Almost the first man he saw was his father,\r\nwho stood on the wharf, behind his office, regarding the little vessel\r\nas if he was greatly interested in her. Something told Tom that the\r\nmerchant had already learned that his son was the supposed owner of the\r\nsloop, and he felt like crying again when he thought of what was yet\r\nto come. Mr. Newcombe, of course, would want to know all about it; and\r\nTom, as usual, would have been very glad indeed to have been able to\r\navoid the interview.\r\n\r\nThe men on the wharves waved their hats as the sloop passed along, but\r\nneither Tom nor Mr. Graves returned the salutation. They were both\r\ntoo busy with their own thoughts to notice what was going on around\r\nthem. In a quarter of an hour the Storm King reached the ship-yard,\r\nand the boat-builder, after giving his crew orders to see that every\r\nthing was snug on board before they left, stepped into a yawl, which\r\none of his men brought out to take him ashore, and motioned to Tom\r\nto follow him. Since learning that his customer was unable to pay for\r\nthe sloop, he had not spoken a word to him. While he believed that Tom\r\nhad four hundred dollars in his pocket, he had been very polite to\r\nhim, and showed him every attention in his power. He had allowed him\r\nto take command of the yacht, had appointed himself first-mate, and\r\ncondescended to obey his orders, and had even instructed the cook to\r\nprepare a dinner which he had provided at his own expense. But when\r\nthe facts of the case were revealed to him, Tom suddenly fell very low\r\nin his estimation. He speedily relieved him of the captaincy without\r\none word of excuse or apology, countermanded his orders concerning the\r\ndinner, and then left Tom to take care of himself; believing, no doubt,\r\nthat a boy whose pockets were empty was not worth noticing. Tom was not\r\nso blind as to allow these slights to escape his attention, and they\r\ncut him to the quick. He determined, from that day forward, to treat\r\nMr. Graves with the contempt he deserved; and to show him that his\r\nfailure to pay for the yacht had not lessened his claims to respect.\r\nDrawing himself up very stiffly, he leisurely climbed down into the\r\nyawl, and taking his stand upon one of the thwarts, he looked straight\r\ntoward the shore, utterly ignoring the presence of the boat-builder,\r\nwho, in the hope of learning something of the plans Tom had in view for\r\nraising the four hundred dollars, made several attempts to enter into\r\nconversation with him. The moment the yawl touched the beach Tom sprang\r\nout and walked rapidly toward the gate, where, to his astonishment and\r\nvexation, he suddenly found himself surrounded by the same boys who\r\nhad seen him start on his voyage in the morning. They appeared to be\r\nintensely delighted about something, and Tom was afraid that his secret\r\nwas already known.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, captain!\" cried Johnny Harding. \"That's a splendid little\r\ncraft of yours!\"\r\n\r\n\"She is, indeed!\" replied Tom, who resolved to \"stick it out\" as long\r\nas possible. \"She's the finest boat about Newport. She sails like\r\nlightning, and is fitted up like a parlor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she belongs to you!\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"Now, didn't I tell you this morning that she was mine?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"There's a screw loose somewhere, captain,\" said Johnny. \"I asked your\r\nfather what that yacht cost you, and he said he wasn't aware that you\r\nowned her.\"\r\n\r\nTom was right in his suspicions. The boys knew all about it, and so\r\ndid his father. Drawing in a long breath, and shutting his teeth hard\r\nto choke back his feelings, he pushed his way through the crowd, and\r\nstarted homeward at a rapid pace, not, however, without a few parting\r\nremarks from the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Hard-a-starboard, there, captain!\" shouted one.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I always was an unlucky boy,\" said another, exactly imitating\r\nTom's lazy, drawling way of talking.\r\n\r\n\"The next time you go to sea in that beautiful yacht of yours, captain,\r\nwe will go with you, if you will be good enough to send us word!\"\r\n\r\nTom heard all these and a good many more exclamations; but he kept\r\nsteady on his way, looking neither to the right nor left, and finally\r\nreached his home without having been so unfortunate as to meet any\r\nmore of his acquaintances. He ran hastily up the stairs to his room,\r\nand, after he had closed and locked the door, he threw himself upon his\r\nbed, and found relief for his pent-up feelings in a copious flood of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMR. NEWCOMBE'S PRESENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about two o'clock when Tom reached his home, and, during the\r\nnext three hours, he lived in a state of mind that can scarcely be\r\ndescribed. He remained in his room, pacing angrily up and down the\r\nfloor, thinking over his numerous troubles, and conjuring up new\r\nschemes for the future--all the while watching the hands of the little\r\ntime-piece that stood on the mantle as they moved slowly around toward\r\nfive o'clock, the hour at which he expected to be summoned into the\r\npresence of his father. He was not sorry for any thing he had done--he\r\nstill had too much confidence in his grand schemes for that--neither\r\ndid he believe that there could be any thing wrong with the gentlemen\r\nin Baltimore; on the contrary, he still imagined them to be the\r\nmost honorable of men--otherwise, they never could have built up so\r\nextensive a business. They were not to blame for his disappointment,\r\nfor had they not told him that his letter had miscarried; that they\r\nhad made every inquiry for it, but could not find it? Some dishonest\r\npost-office clerk was at the bottom of all his troubles! How Tom wished\r\nhe had him there, locked up in his room with him! Wouldn't he pay him\r\nfor all the misery he had caused him! He would beat him next time, for\r\nhe would send his ten dollars by express.\r\n\r\nMr. Newcombe was on time that evening, for, just as the clock struck\r\nfive, Tom heard his step in the hall. The unpleasant interview was\r\nnot far distant, and Tom began to prepare himself for it by plunging\r\nhis face into the wash-bowl, and trying to hide all traces of his\r\ntears. Scarcely had he performed this operation, when he heard his\r\nfather calling him. Hastily drying his face upon the towel, he slowly\r\ndescended to the library, where he found the merchant walking up and\r\ndown the floor, with his hands behind his back.\r\n\r\n\"Close the door, Tom,\" said he, \"and sit down; I want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nTom reluctantly obeyed, and Mr. Newcombe continued: \"I have been down\r\nto the ship-yard to look at your new yacht.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, she doesn't belong to me yet!\" drawled Tom, whirling his cap\r\nin his hand, and looking down at the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I understand that she was built by your order,\" said the\r\nmerchant. \"I think she is a splendid little vessel. I admire your\r\ntaste, but I should have been much better pleased if you had consulted\r\nme in the matter.\"\r\n\r\nTom looked down at the carpet, and had nothing to say. He thought that,\r\nif he had asked his father's advice, the yacht would not have been\r\nbuilt at all.\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred dollars is a good price to pay for a pleasure-boat,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Newcombe. \"I think the Mystery is quite large enough, and\r\nfast enough, to answer your purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, she isn't, father,\" drawled Tom; \"I am going to be a trader!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are? How do you expect to carry on your business? With that sloop,\r\nyour expenses will be considerable, and you have no money that I know\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am going to get some,\" said Tom. \"I'll be rich in two weeks\r\nmore. I'll be worth five thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Newcombe opened his eyes when he heard this. He had learned the\r\nparticulars of the matter from Mr. Graves, as far as the latter knew\r\nthem, but he was satisfied that he had not heard all the story, and\r\nthat Tom had some secret the boat-builder knew nothing about. Knowing\r\nTom as well as he did, he had made up his mind to listen to something\r\nridiculous, but he was not prepared to hear that he expected soon to be\r\na rich man.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to get so much money?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I know!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tell me; I would like to know something about it also.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, isn't it enough for you to know that I am going to get it honestly,\r\nand that I don't intend to cheat any body?\" whined Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No; that will not satisfy me. I want to know all about it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Newcombe spoke these words rather sternly, and Tom knew that it was\r\ndangerous to hesitate longer. \"I am going to get the money of some men\r\nin Baltimore,\" said he, the tears starting to his eyes again: \"they\r\nhave promised me five thousand dollars, if I will act as their agent.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very liberal. What is their business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lottery business!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\nThe merchant was really amazed now. He arose to his feet and walked up\r\nand down the floor, repeating the words over and over again, as if he\r\ncould scarcely understand them. At length he stopped in front of Tom,\r\nand inquired:\r\n\r\n\"How did you find out that these men wanted an agent? Now, I want you\r\nto tell me all about it, from beginning to end.\"\r\n\r\nTom, as was always the case with him when called upon to explain any of\r\nhis schemes to his father, had tried to avoid coming to the point. He\r\ndid not want Mr. Newcombe to become acquainted with all his secrets,\r\nbut, knowing by the latter's looks that it was time for him to speak\r\nif he wished to keep out of trouble, he began at the beginning and\r\ntold the whole story. He said he had become tired of the office, but,\r\nbeing well aware of the fact that he could not get out of it until he\r\nshould be able to satisfy his father that he had some better business\r\nin view, he had finally decided that the easiest occupation in which he\r\ncould engage was trading. He determined to go into it on a grand scale\r\nthis time, but, having no capital with which to carry out his plans,\r\nhe had commenced reading the advertisements in the newspapers, in the\r\nhope of \"getting an idea,\" and he had thus obtained the address of the\r\nproprietors of the lottery. (Here Tom produced their advertisement.\r\nHe had carried it next to his heart for the last month.) He then went\r\non to repeat what he had written in his letter to them, as near as he\r\ncould remember it, and handed his father the one he had received in\r\nreply. He related the particulars of the interview with Bob Jennings,\r\nrehearsed the arguments he had used to induce him to advance the five\r\ndollars to send for the \"lucky package,\" and told his father that he\r\nhad then ordered the Storm King, because he believed that his fortune\r\nwas made, and that, in a very few days, he would be the wealthiest boy\r\nof his age in the village. \"And I would certainly have got the money,\"\r\nsaid he, in conclusion, \"if some rascally post-office clerk hadn't\r\nstolen my letter.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Newcombe grew more and more astonished as Tom proceeded with his\r\nstory, but he listened patiently to every word of it, and heard him\r\nthrough without interruption. It did not seem possible to him that\r\na boy, fifteen years old, could seriously entertain such ridiculous\r\nideas. For a long time he sat gazing at the letter, which he still held\r\nin his hand, then he read the advertisement, and finally he looked at\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Graves told me that you wanted him to credit you for two or three\r\nweeks,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, yes, I did!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"But your lottery scheme has failed; so where would you get the four\r\nhundred dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, it hasn't failed yet, father!\" replied Tom. \"I am going to give\r\nit a fair trial. Haven't you often told me to 'try again, and keep\r\ntrying, and I'll be certain to succeed?'\"\r\n\r\n\"But just suppose that, with all your trying, the money does not come!\"\r\nsaid Mr. Newcombe, who did not think it best to attempt to answer this\r\nquestion. \"What will you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go to work and make it by trading.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will have to do better than you did before. Have you\r\nforgotten your game chickens?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, I haven't!\" drawled Tom. \"I ought to have known better than to\r\nexpect to make any money then, because I wasn't fixed for it; but, if I\r\nowned that splendid little sloop, I would be all right. She was built\r\non purpose for a trading-boat, and if I couldn't make four hundred\r\ndollars in two or three weeks with her, I would like to know what is\r\nthe reason!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Newcombe, \"suppose Mr. Graves was willing to\r\ncredit you for two or three weeks, and I was willing he should do so,\r\nwhere is your capital to begin with? Where's the money to hire your\r\ncrew and to buy your first cargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'll get that from those gentlemen in Baltimore,\" replied Tom. \"But\r\nyou can't understand this business, father. Just let me alone for a\r\nmonth or so, and I'll show you that I can make plenty of money.\"\r\n\r\nTom was quite right when he said that his father could not understand\r\nthe business; indeed, Mr. Newcombe was more than half inclined to\r\nbelieve that Tom did not understand it himself. If his prize failed\r\nto come to hand, he would earn the four hundred dollars to pay for\r\nthe yacht by trading; but he was still depending upon the lottery\r\nto furnish the money to hire his crew and buy his first cargo. The\r\nmerchant had never listened to such reasoning before, and it was no\r\nwonder he could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" said he, at length, \"are you really foolish enough to put faith\r\nin any such nonsense as this? Do you honestly believe that these men\r\nare what they represent themselves to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, I do!\" drawled Tom. \"Their letter has a printed heading, just\r\nlike yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe they are honorable business men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do!\" repeated Tom. \"I am not afraid to trust them. Do you\r\nsuppose that men who have agents in every civilized country on the\r\nglobe dare cheat any body? I am going to send them the very next\r\nten-dollar bill I get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall take care that you do not get one very soon,\" said the\r\nmerchant. \"That will do; I have nothing further to say to you at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, father,\" began Tom----\r\n\r\n\"We will not say any thing more about this just now,\" interrupted Mr.\r\nNewcombe.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am aground again,\" said Tom to himself, as he put on his cap and\r\nleft the room. \"If I don't get any more ten-dollar bills I must give\r\nup all hopes of ever getting one of those prizes. Something is always\r\nhappening to bother me!\"\r\n\r\nHe did not see his father again until supper-time, and then not a word\r\nwas said about the lottery. The merchant appeared to be as cheerful\r\nas usual, but that did not quiet Tom's feelings, for he knew that the\r\nmatter was not yet settled. He would have been glad indeed to know\r\nwhat would be done about it, but he could not muster up courage enough\r\nto ask his father any questions. He passed that night in much the\r\nsame manner that he had passed the preceding one, tossing restlessly\r\nabout on his bed; and when he slept, he was troubled with dreams, in\r\nwhich the Storm King, the proprietors of the lottery, and Bob Jennings\r\nbore prominent parts. The next morning he went down to the office as\r\nusual--being careful on the way to avoid the principal streets, so that\r\nhe might not meet any boys of his acquaintance--and there he found his\r\nfather and Mr. Graves engaged in conversation. The latter seemed to\r\nhave recovered his usual spirits, for he was laughing at some remark\r\nmade by the merchant, and he even shook hands with Tom and wished him a\r\nhearty good morning. Perhaps the large roll of bank-bills he was just\r\nputting into his pocket had something to do with his good, nature! Tom\r\nnoticed them at once; and he could hardly refrain from shouting with\r\ndelight, when the thought flashed through his mind that his father had\r\nbought the yacht, and was intending to set him up in business as a\r\ntrader. He soon became convinced that such was the fact; for, as Mr.\r\nGraves turned to go, the merchant inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Is she complete in every particular?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" was the reply. \"She is finished alow and aloft, and\r\nsupplied with every thing she needs, from an anchor down to a marlin\r\nspike.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves then took leave of the merchant, and walked off, whistling\r\nsoftly to himself, while Tom sank into a chair and awaited the issue\r\nof events with an impatience he did not try to conceal. Mr. Newcombe\r\nwalked a few times across the office with his eyes fastened on the\r\nfloor, as if in deep meditation, and then seating himself at his desk,\r\nhe took out a sheet of note-paper and wrote a long letter. When it was\r\nfinished he put it into an envelope and handed it to Tom, with the\r\nrequest that he would take it to the military academy.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I'm not going to be a trader after all!\" thought Tom, as he\r\nbegan to search about the office for his cap. \"I just know that I have\r\ngot to go back to that school! I won't stay there long! I am not going\r\nto be shut up for five or six months without a single leave of absence,\r\nnow I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the street he glanced at the letter, and saw that it\r\nwas addressed to the principal of the academy. This was enough to\r\nconfirm him in his suspicions, and, while on the way to the school, he\r\nthought over several plans for escape, that suggested themselves to his\r\nmind. If he should be unfortunate enough to be shut up in the academy\r\nagain, he knew that it would be something of a task to get out of it;\r\nfor the students having turned against him, on account of the troubles\r\nthey had brought upon themselves by taking part in his runaway scheme,\r\nhe would have no one to assist him. But Tom had great confidence in\r\nhimself, and he was certain that he could arrange matters to his entire\r\nsatisfaction. He would fight against it as long as he could; but, if\r\nhis father was determined that he should go back to the academy, he\r\nwould, alone and unaided, occasion a greater uproar in the village than\r\nhad ever been heard there before.\r\n\r\nArriving at the gate, he rang the bell, handed the letter to the guard,\r\nwho answered the summons, and then slowly retraced his steps toward the\r\noffice. He had not gone far when he met his friend Johnny Harding.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, captain!\" said Johnny, taking off his cap, and making a\r\nvery low bow; \"I hope you are well!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, look here!\" drawled Tom. \"I want you to quit calling me\r\ncaptain!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact!\" said Johnny. \"I ought to stop it, for you are not the\r\nmaster of the Storm King now. I expect Bill Steele will be her next\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Bill Steele!\" repeated Tom. \"Not the colonel of the academy battalion?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the very fellow. She couldn't be in better hands, for I\r\nunderstand that he is a capital sailor. He is a New Bedford boy, and,\r\nof course, knows all about a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, how is he going to get her?\" asked Tom, who was very much\r\nastonished at this information.\r\n\r\n\"Why, haven't you heard that your father has presented her to the\r\nprincipal of the academy? Well, it's a fact. Mr. Graves told me all\r\nabout it, not five minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I can't be a trader!\" whined Tom, hiding his face in his\r\nhandkerchief. \"I won't stand it; that's just all about it! If I don't\r\nsail that sloop, nobody shall. I'll sink her so deep in the bay that\r\nshe can never be raised again!\" As Tom said this, he abruptly left\r\nJohnny and walked rapidly down the street.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the severest blow he had yet experienced. To be obliged\r\nto see that fine little yacht, which had been built in accordance\r\nwith his orders, which every one in the village so much admired, and\r\nwhich he had so long regarded as his own property, to see her pass\r\ninto the hands of some one else, and the very one of all others he\r\nmost despised, was more than he could endure. Bill Steele seemed to be\r\nhis evil genius. He had obtained possession of the silver eagles, and\r\nreceived the colonel's commission, for which Tom had worked so hard;\r\nand now, he was to be the captain of the Storm King! If the principal\r\nhad purchased the yacht, Tom thought he would not have felt so badly\r\nabout it; but his own father had bought her, and, instead of giving\r\nher to him, as he ought to have done, and setting him up in business\r\nas a trader, he had presented her to the faculty of the military\r\nschool, when he knew, all the while, that his son disliked every one of\r\nthem. Another thing that made Tom very angry, was the thought that he\r\nhimself had been the bearer of the letter in which his father offered\r\nthe yacht for the principal's acceptance. If he had met Johnny five\r\nminutes sooner, he never would have carried that letter to its address.\r\nHe would have torn it up, or thrown it into the harbor. Tom was sorely\r\ndistressed. It was no easy matter to keep back his tears, but having\r\nbeen given many opportunities to practice self-control, during the\r\ncourse of his varied and eventful life, and being at that very moment\r\non one of the principal streets, where people were constantly passing\r\nhim, he struggled manfully with his emotion, and even succeeded in\r\nforcing a smile upon his face. By the time he reached the office he\r\nhad so far choked down his feelings, that a stranger would never have\r\nimagined him to be a disappointed boy, or that he regarded himself as\r\nthe most abused person in existence.\r\n\r\nDuring all that forenoon he performed his duties as usual, and when he\r\nwent home, to dinner with his father, the latter told him what he had\r\ndone with the Storm King. \"Mr. Graves built her expecting that I would\r\npay for her,\" said he, \"and, of course, I could not disappoint him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why didn't you give her to me?\" inquired Tom. \"They have no use\r\nfor her at the academy.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, they have!\" returned Mr. Newcombe. \"I have often heard the\r\nprincipal say that a vessel of some description, that could be handled\r\nby the students, would be of great service to him. You know that some\r\nof the scholars are studying navigation, and I thought they could make\r\nbetter use of her than you could.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, did you mean what you said, when you told me that you\r\nwould take care that I didn't get any ten-dollar bills very soon?\"\r\nasked Tom, in a gloomy voice.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I did. You have convinced me that you do not know how to use\r\nmoney, so I have decided that the best thing I can do is to put your\r\nwages in the bank. They will be safe there!\"\r\n\r\nThis was all that was said on the subject at that time. Tom did not\r\nremonstrate with his father, because he knew that it would be entirely\r\nuseless. For the same reason Mr. Newcombe did not take Tom to task for\r\nwhat he had done or offer him any advice. All the talking he could have\r\ndone, would not have convinced Tom that he had acted foolishly or that,\r\nas often as he built his hopes upon such schemes, he was doomed to be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBOB MAKES A DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, we repeat, did not try to induce his father to reconsider the\r\ndecision he had made in regard to the Storm King, and the manner in\r\nwhich his son's wages ought to be disposed of, for he knew that all the\r\npromises he could make, and all the arguments he could bring to bear\r\nupon him, would have no effect. The yacht was lost to him, and that was\r\na settled fact. He regretted it exceedingly, but still he was not so\r\nmuch troubled about that, as by the thought that he could no longer use\r\nhis money as he pleased. This was like the law against going outside\r\nthe gate after dark--unreasonable and unjust; and was made simply\r\nbecause his father \"didn't want him to enjoy himself if he could help\r\nit.\" He had fully made up his mind to save his next two weeks' wages to\r\nsend for the \"lucky package,\" and he was certain that his second trial\r\nof the lottery scheme would prove successful. The reason it had failed\r\nbefore was, because some dishonest post-office clerk had stolen the\r\nletter that contained his ten dollars; but now he would be on the safe\r\nside, for he would send his money by express. When his prize arrived\r\n(he would send all his own money this time, so that, when the five\r\nthousand dollars came, he would not be obliged to divide it with any\r\none), it had been his intention to order Mr. Graves to build another\r\nyacht for him, that would be as far superior to the Storm King, in\r\npoint of speed and finish, as she was better than Bob Jennings's old\r\nscow. But he could no longer indulge in these glorious anticipations.\r\nHis splendid scheme had at last received its death-wound, and, worse\r\nthan all, there was not a single boy in the village who sympathized\r\nwith him. Even the fisher-boy had called him a Jonah, and refused to\r\nhave any thing more to do with him. However, Tom was not willing to\r\nlet the matter drop there. If Colonel Steele, and the rest of the\r\nacademy fellows, supposed that he would permit them to enjoy their new\r\nvessel, they were destined to be sadly disappointed. If he did not own\r\nand sail that yacht, no one about that village should. He had said it\r\nmore than once, and he was in earnest; and his father, and every body\r\nelse in Newport, would very soon find out that his desires and claims\r\nwere not to be set aside with impunity. Tom did not then make up his\r\nmind what he would do; but when he stood in the door of his father's\r\noffice, about four o'clock that afternoon, and saw the Storm King sail\r\nmajestically out of the harbor, manned by a crew from the academy--and\r\nher new captain sprung upon the rail and proposed three cheers for Mr.\r\nNewcombe--the scene acted like a spur upon his flagging ideas, and in\r\nan instant his resolve was taken. He waited until the yacht had rounded\r\nthe pier and shaped her course down the bay, and then he sauntered out\r\non the wharf, where the fisher-boy was at work at his wood-pile.\r\n\r\n\"Bob Jennings,\" said he, \"do you still believe me to be a Jonah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am a little afraid of you,\" was the reply. \"You didn't get the\r\nyacht after all. Those academy fellows seem to be delighted with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"They had better use her while they can,\" answered Tom, shaking his\r\nhead threateningly. \"They will not have her very long. I suppose you\r\ndon't want any thing more to do with my plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I believe not. Money is what I need now, and I can make more by\r\nsawing wood than I can by helping you in your grand schemes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stick to it, then,\" said Tom, angrily. \"I hope you will be a poor man\r\nas long as you live. Look out for me, now. You are going back on me\r\nlike all the rest of the Spooneys, and I'll be sure to get even with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not quite understand this last remark; but, before\r\nhe had time to ask any questions, Tom had walked to the edge of the\r\nwharf, and was beckoning to Sam Barton. When the yawl came up, he\r\nclimbed down into it, and was ferried across the harbor. He did not get\r\nout, however, when he reached the opposite side, but sat in the boat\r\nand held a long and earnest conversation with Sam. Bob, who had watched\r\nall these movements, thought he must have been telling him some secret;\r\nfor, when two or three of the ferry-boys came up to hear what Tom was\r\nsaying, Sam ordered them to go away and attend to their own business.\r\nFinally, the bully pulled the yawl under the wharf out of sight; and\r\nBob, who kept one eye directed across the harbor, did not see them come\r\nout again until the six o'clock bell rang.\r\n\r\nSince he had begun the work of retrieving his lost fortune, the\r\nfisher-boy had worked early and late. The first peep of day found\r\nhim at his wood-pile, and, as the moon shone brightly every night,\r\nit was sometimes nine or ten o'clock before he left the wharf. He\r\nate his breakfast before he started from home, and, in order that\r\nhe might not lose a moment from his work, he brought his dinner and\r\nsupper with him. He looked upon every instant of time as too valuable\r\nto be wasted, but the singular movements of Tom Newcombe had excited\r\nhis curiosity, and for the next two hours his work progressed rather\r\nslowly. He wondered what his aristocratic friend had to say to that\r\nfellow! He was satisfied that Tom had some new idea in his head, but he\r\ncould not imagine what it could be that he should need the assistance\r\nof Sam Barton in carrying it out. The only conclusion he could come to\r\nwas, that Tom was trying to borrow ten dollars from the bully to send\r\nfor the \"lucky package.\" Sam was rich, as fortunes were measured in\r\nFishertown, and it was not likely that he would refuse to accommodate\r\nTom with a few dollars, believing, as he did, that he was able to pay\r\nhim a big interest, and that there was no danger of losing it. If that\r\nwas the object of Tom's interview with the bully he must have been\r\nsuccessful; for, when the six o'clock bell rang, and Sam brought his\r\npassenger back to his own side of the harbor, Bob saw that he was in\r\nexcellent spirits. He walked toward the office snapping his fingers and\r\nwhistling a gay tune, and as he passed by the fisher-boy he shook his\r\nhead at him, as if to say, \"I am all right now!\"\r\n\r\nBob worked late that night. Even after Mr. Henry had closed his store,\r\nand the wharf had been deserted by every body except Mr. Newcombe's\r\nnight watchman, he kept busy in spite of his weary muscles and heavy\r\neyelids. Besides being anxious to earn the twenty-six dollars, with\r\nwhich to settle his indebtedness to Mr. Graves, the fisher-boy had\r\nanother object in working so late. He was punishing himself. Every time\r\nhe stopped to wipe the perspiration from his face he would say:\r\n\r\n\"It serves you just right, Bob Jennings! I don't pity you in the least.\r\nYou were well off in the world at one time. You had money in the bank,\r\nand were not ashamed to look any man in Newport in the face. Now look\r\nat you! Go to work, and don't be fooling away your time here!\" Then Bob\r\nwould put another stick of wood on his saw-horse, and his tired arms\r\nwould drive the saw as if his life depended upon getting his pile of\r\nwood done in the shortest possible space of time.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past nine o'clock the fisher-boy thought it time to go home.\r\nHe ceased his work and stood looking at his pile of wood he had cut\r\nthat day, when, upon raising his eyes, he saw a boy spring behind the\r\ncorner of Mr. Newcombe's warehouse. Had this happened a month before,\r\nhe would have paid no attention to it; but, as he had not yet given\r\nup all hopes of recovering the Go Ahead No. 2, nor forgotten that Sam\r\nBarton was his bitter enemy, and only awaiting a favorable opportunity\r\nto be revenged upon him, the simple fact of a boy dodging behind the\r\nwarehouse was enough to arouse his suspicions. He had recognized the\r\nspy, and knew him to be one of the bully's particular friends; but what\r\nwas he doing about the wharf at that hour, and why was he watching\r\nBob? The fisher-boy was sure that he was watching him, or he would\r\nnot have taken so much pains to keep out of his sight. He did not\r\nfeel altogether safe for he was afraid that Sam and his band were\r\nlurking behind some of the neighboring buildings, intending to waylay\r\nhim on his way home; in which case he would probably be very severely\r\nhandled. They were five or six to his one, and if they were resolved\r\nto have a fight with him, he could not hope to come off unharmed. But\r\nBob, knowing that he had never given Sam Barton, or any other boy\r\nabout Fishertown, any cause for enmity, had no idea of standing still\r\nand allowing himself to be whipped. Without removing his eyes from\r\nthe corner of the building where the spy had disappeared, he picked a\r\nsmall, round stick of wood from the pile, sawed it in two, and, after\r\ntesting the strength of both pieces by pounding them upon the wharf,\r\nhe shouldered the one he thought he could use to the best advantage in\r\ncase of an attack, and set out for home. He walked along at a brisk\r\npace, casting anxious glances around every corner he passed, and\r\nkeeping a sharp lookout for enemies in the rear; but the only person\r\nhe saw was the boy who had been watching him on the wharf, and who\r\nwas now following him at a respectful distance. The spy's movements\r\nindicated that he did not wish to be seen. Every time Bob stopped and\r\nlooked around, he would step into a door-way, or drop down behind a box\r\nor barrel on the sidewalk; and when the fisher-boy walked on, he would\r\nfollow him as before. He performed his work in a very clumsy manner,\r\nfor Bob saw every move he made; and, before he reached Fishertown, he\r\nhad changed his mind in regard to the spy's object in following him.\r\nHe was not awaiting an opportunity to signal to Sam Barton that the\r\ntime had come for him to \"get even\" with his rival, but he was simply\r\nwatching Bob to see that he went home. Now, why did he want him to go\r\nhome? Undoubtedly, because his chief had some project in view, which\r\nhe was afraid to attempt until he knew that the fisher-boy was in bed\r\nand asleep. This was the way Bob looked at the matter, and subsequent\r\nevents proved that he was right.\r\n\r\nBeing no longer afraid of an attack, the fisher-boy threw away his\r\nclub, and walked on faster than ever. He did not turn again to look at\r\nthe spy, until just as he reached home, when a single glance told him\r\nthat he was still in sight. Instead of going into the house, Bob kept\r\non around it, and took his stand at one corner, where he could observe\r\nthe movements of his pursuer when he came up. About twenty yards from\r\nwhere he stood was another cabin, whose inmates had retired to rest;\r\nand presently the spy appeared, and stopped in the shadow of this\r\ncabin. He glanced hastily around, to make sure that there was no one\r\nin sight, listened attentively for a moment, to satisfy himself that\r\nall was quiet in the cabins, and then seated himself on the ground, and\r\nrested his elbows on his knees, as if he had decided to remain there\r\nduring the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nFor the next half hour neither Bob nor the spy scarcely moved a\r\nmuscle. The latter sat gazing intently at the house, as if he was\r\ntrying to look through the boards to obtain a view of what was going\r\non inside; and the fisher-boy stood in his concealment, wondering how\r\nlong his strange visitor intended to remain there, and trying in vain\r\nto determine what Sam's object could be in sending a boy to watch him\r\nat that time of night; for, that the bully was at the bottom of the\r\nwhole affair, Bob did not for a moment doubt. Finally, the spy began\r\nto grow restless; and, after stretching his arms and yawning, as if\r\nhe had become very sleepy, he arose to his feet, and with cautious\r\nsteps approached the place where Bob was standing. The fisher-boy's\r\nfears that he had been discovered were speedily put at rest, for the\r\nspy passed within ten feet of him, and kept on around the house. Having\r\nthus satisfied himself that none of the family were stirring, he broke\r\ninto a run and started back toward the village, followed by Bob, who\r\nhad resolved to find out the cause of these mysterious movements, if he\r\ndid not sleep a wink that night. The spy kept on at a rapid pace, until\r\nhe reached the wharf, where he again became cautious in his movements.\r\nMr. Newcombe's watchman was walking up and down behind the warehouse,\r\nand the spy did not want to attract his attention. He moved across\r\nthe wharf on his hands and knees, and then, after casting suspicious\r\nglances around him, he suddenly disappeared from the view of the\r\nfisher-boy, who ran swiftly to the edge of the pier, and looked over\r\ninto the harbor, just in time to see Sam Barton's yawl moving slowly\r\nout of sight among the spiles. This was enough to satisfy him that\r\nsomething unusual was going on, and he became more determined than ever\r\nto see the end of all these strange proceedings. He made up his mind to\r\nfollow that boat wherever it went; and, there was but one way that he\r\ncould do it, and that was by swimming. He waited fully five minutes,\r\nin order to give the yawl time to get so far under the wharf that he\r\nwould not be discovered, and then he let himself down into the water\r\nand swam in among the spiles. There he found himself in almost Egyptian\r\ndarkness, but he could hear the occupants of the yawl whispering to\r\neach other, and that guided him in the pursuit. Presently the light of\r\na lantern flashed through the darkness, and, as its rays fell upon the\r\nfaces of the boys in the yawl, Bob was astonished to recognize, in one\r\nof them, his friend Tom Newcombe; and he was still more amazed when he\r\nsaw one of the crew remove the board that concealed the entrance to the\r\ncave. He watched the band, as, one after the other, they disappeared\r\nthrough the opening, until Sam Barton, who came last, pulled the board\r\nback to its place, and Bob was left alone in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe moment Sam disappeared the fisher-boy struck out for the cave,\r\nintent upon getting close enough to it to see what was going on inside,\r\nand to overhear the conversation carried on between its occupants.\r\n\r\nThe entrance had been so carefully concealed that not a ray of light\r\ncould be seen; but he had noted the exact position of the cave; and,\r\nbesides, he was guided by the loud barking of a dog, which refused to\r\nkeep silent, in spite of a severe beating somebody was giving him. The\r\nnoise led Bob directly to the cave, and when he crawled out on the bank\r\nand listened a moment at the door, he found, to his joy, that he could\r\ndistinctly hear every word that was said.\r\n\r\n\"Kill him, Friday!\" he heard the bully exclaim, probably addressing\r\nhimself to the person who was beating the dog. \"Make him hush that\r\nnoise, or the first thing we know we'll have visitors. Stand back a\r\nlittle out of his sight, Tommy. You're a stranger to him and he don't\r\nlike your looks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid that some one will hear him?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That's not likely, unless that ar Bobby Jennings, or Mr. Grimes, is\r\non the watch. Will Atkins, are you sartin an' sure that you see Bob go\r\nhome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I sartin an' sure that I've got a pair of eyes?\" asked Atkins. \"I\r\nknow that he is abed and fast asleep afore this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen will please come to order, now!\" said Sam, when Friday had\r\nsucceeded in quieting the dog. \"Take off your hats an' set down like\r\nmen had oughter do. The first thing we have got to 'tend to, is to\r\nsettle this business with Tommy. He says he has seed enough of them\r\nswells in the village; he is down on Bobby Jennings; he wants to go\r\nwith us, an' is willin' to furnish his share of the outfit. He has\r\npromised to keep a still tongue in his head, an' to obey all orders;\r\nan' now we must give him a name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be the first mate,\" said Tom, who, having held high offices in\r\nseveral societies, thought himself worthy of being second in authority\r\nin the Crusoe band. \"I am a first-class sailor, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"We aint goin' to have no mates,\" interrupted Sam. \"I am captain,\r\ngovernor, chief, an' all the rest of the officers in one. I can manage\r\nthese fellers without any help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call him Friday's Father!\" said Jack Spaniard. \"That's a good name.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I don't like it,\" drawled Tom. \"Was Friday's father a brave\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the book don't say much about him,\" replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\"He was a nigger,\" said Will Atkins.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I don't want to be named after a darkey,\" whined Tom. \"Wasn't\r\nthere some brave, strong white fellow in Crusoe's band?\"\r\n\r\n\"Call yourself Muley, then!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was he?\" asked Tom, who, it was evident, had never read Robinson\r\nCrusoe.\r\n\r\n\"He was the chap the governor throwed overboard when he ran away with\r\nXury and the boat,\" replied Sam. \"He was a brave feller, an' a reg'lar\r\nwater-dog. He swam four miles to reach the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the name a bit,\" said Tom. \"I would rather be called\r\ncaptain, or mate, or general, or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the only officer in the band,\" repeated Sam. \"If you don't like\r\nany of them names, pick out one for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThat was something Tom could not do. He was not acquainted with the\r\nnames of any of the characters in the book, and consequently he was\r\nobliged to consent to be called after the Moor Robinson had thrown\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\n\"That's settled,\" said Sam, opening the dilapidated copy of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, and taking from it a sheet of soiled foolscap; \"and the next\r\nthing is for you to sign the shipping articles. Listen to 'em.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"shipping articles\" were like a good many similar documents Tom\r\nhad written--rather badly mixed up--but, by listening attentively,\r\nthe eavesdropper outside of the cave got an insight into matters; for\r\nthus far every thing had been Greek to him. He learned, to his intense\r\nastonishment, that Sam and his friends had organized the society with\r\nthe express purpose of hunting up an island somewhere in the ocean\r\nand living Crusoe life. He also discovered that Sam was the supreme\r\nruler of the band; that his orders must be obeyed without the least\r\nhesitation; and that any boy who exposed the secrets of the society,\r\nor was detected in trying to get up a mutiny, would be punished as\r\nthe chief thought proper. As Sam read this part of the \"shipping\r\narticles,\" he put on a terrible frown, and spoke in a very gruff\r\nvoice, which was, no doubt, intended to convince the new member that\r\nif he dared to be guilty of treason, his punishment would be something\r\nawful. Tom, having never before held the rank of private in any secret\r\norganization, hesitated a little about signing away his liberty. Sam\r\nhad the reputation of being a terrible tyrant, and he did not want to\r\nput himself too much in his power. However, he had no alternative that\r\nhe could discover. The members of the Crusoe band were the only friends\r\nhe had; he had cast his lot with them, and he had already gone too far\r\nto desert them.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Tommy?\" asked the chief, when he had finished reading\r\nthe \"shipping articles.\" \"Them's our rules, an' you can say yes or no\r\nto 'em, jest as you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say yes!\" answered Tom. \"I'll obey all orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe new member then stepped up to the flour barrel, and affixed his\r\nsignature to the paper with a blunt lead-pencil, about an inch in\r\nlength, which was the only thing in the shape of writing material\r\npossessed by the band. He was then hailed as a member by the chief, who\r\nshook him cordially by the hand and patted him on the back, while the\r\nothers complimented him in language that grated harshly on his ears.\r\n\r\n\"No time for foolin', fellers!\" said the chief, at length. \"Set down\r\nagin, an' let's have a talk about the Storm King.\"\r\n\r\n\"There aint no need of talkin' much about her,\" said Friday. \"It\r\nwouldn't be healthy for us to get into a fight now. We might get\r\nwhipped, an' that would be the last of the Crusoe band.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have her,\" said Sam, \"for she'd jest suit us. What do you\r\nsay, Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, take her by all means,\" replied the new member. \"I joined you\r\nbecause I thought you would go to sea in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But mebbe we can't get her. We don't like the looks of the muskets\r\nthem 'cademy fellers carry. They might punch us with their bayonets.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must run that risk,\" said Tom, who would have been the last one to\r\nface the muskets of the students. \"I am not captain of this band; if I\r\nwas, I would capture her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you could do it, I guess I can,\" said Sam. \"But, before we\r\nlay any plans fur capturin' that boat, we ought to find out exactly how\r\nthe land lays. Friday, you an' Jack Spaniard will go up to the 'cademy\r\nto-morrow, an' see how many fellers there are to guard her. If there's\r\nnot more'n six or eight of 'em, we'll have her; but if they are too\r\nheavy for us, we'll have to stick to our old plan of goin' to sea in my\r\nyawl. The meetin' is out, now.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing these words the fisher-boy, who had stood just outside\r\nthe door of the cave while all this conversation was going on, stepped\r\nback into the water, and concealed himself behind the timbers that\r\nsupported the wharf, believing that, as the meeting had been dismissed,\r\nthe band would at once leave their hiding-place. No doubt they would\r\nhave done so if it had not been for Tom Newcombe. As this was his first\r\nvisit to the cave, he was greatly interested in every thing he saw, and\r\nhe stopped to examine the different articles, and to ask the chief's\r\nadvice about the share of the outfit he was expected to furnish.\r\nThe fisher-boy heard the talking, and thinking they might be saying\r\nsomething that would be useful for him to know, he crawled out of the\r\nwater, and again took his stand close to the door of the cave, just in\r\ntime to hear Tom remark--\r\n\r\n\"I thought you knew something about Bob Jennings's skiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"In course I did,\" replied Sam, with a laugh. \"An' as you are one of\r\nus now, I'll tell you all about it.\" Then the chief began and gave the\r\nnew member a complete history of the rivalry that had so long existed\r\nbetween himself and Bob, and wound up by describing the manner in which\r\nhe and his band had obtained possession of the Go Ahead No. 2, to all\r\nof which the fisher-boy listened eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"You'll paint her over, give her a new name, and sell her to somebody,\r\nto raise a few dollars to help along your expedition, will you?\" said\r\nhe to himself, when Sam had finished his story. \"Not much, Mr. Barton!\r\nI'll see that this little game of yours--\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy's soliloquy was interrupted by an event that was as\r\nsudden as it was unexpected. One of the band threw open the door of the\r\ncave, whose interior was presented to Bob's astonished view. He saw\r\nthe shot-guns and powder-flasks that were hung up against the walls,\r\nthe heavier articles that were piled in the corners, the bull-dog\r\nwhich was chained opposite the entrance; but, plainer than all, he saw\r\nthe Go Ahead No. 2, occupying the middle of the cave. Bob took these\r\nthings all in at a single glance, and his first impulse was to spring\r\ninto the cave and square accounts with the governor, by giving him a\r\ngood drubbing. The next thought that occurred to him, however, was,\r\nthat he was in a very dangerous situation. He had discovered something\r\nthat might send Sam Barton to the House of Refuge for a few years, and\r\nthere was no knowing what the bully might do if he got his hands upon\r\nhim. More than that, the boy who had thrown open the door, and who had\r\nstarted back in dismay as the rays of the lantern fell upon Bob's face,\r\nvery speedily recovered himself, and alarmed the band by exclaiming\r\n\r\n\"Well, if here aint that ar Jennings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bobby Jennings!\" repeated Sam Barton in alarm, \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just outside the door, listenin' to every word we said!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out there every one of you!\" commanded the chief, who readily\r\ncomprehended the situation, and saw the necessity of prompt action.\r\n\"Don't let him get away, unless--\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need of Sam's finishing the sentence The boys knew very\r\nwell what would happen if Bob Jennings made his escape, and they\r\nall sprang out of the cave, determined to effect the capture of the\r\neavesdropper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBOB A PRISONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genuine Robinson Crusoe, when he discovered the foot-print on his\r\nisland, was not more astonished than Sam Barton was at that moment;\r\nnor were the fears he experienced more terrible than those which\r\nflashed through the mind of the chief, when he received the astounding\r\nintelligence that Bob Jennings, instead of being at home and in bed,\r\nas his spy had reported, had been standing almost within reach of him,\r\nlistening to every word he uttered. The fisher-boy had learned a secret\r\nwhich rendered him quite as dangerous to the governor as the cannibals\r\nwere to Crusoe, and the safety of his band depended upon his ability to\r\nprevent him from returning to the upper world with the information he\r\nhad gained.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up there, lads!\" whispered Sam, excitedly, as he sprang into the\r\nyawl and pushed it from the shore, \"we can't catch him any too quick.\r\nBut whatever you do, be careful about makin' a noise!\"\r\n\r\n\"There he is!\" exclaimed Jack Spaniard, as a slight splashing in the\r\nwater attracted his attention. \"Hold that light up higher, Friday.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy elevated the lantern above his head, and its rays fell full\r\nupon the face of the fisher-boy, who was in the act of turning to\r\nlook at his pursuers. Believing that his chances for finding a safe\r\nhiding-place under the pier were very slim indeed, he had struck out\r\nfor the harbor, and was working his way through the water at a rate of\r\nspeed that made Sam extremely nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Push ahead, fellows!\" said he, taking his stand in the bow of the\r\nyawl, with the lantern in one hand and the boat-hook in the other.\r\n\"Send her along lively. Hold on, there, Bobby Jennings, or I'll rap you\r\nover the head.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fisher-boy swam faster than ever. The bully was not yet near\r\nenough to strike him with the boat-hook, and he did not intend to\r\nallow him to come within reach if he could help it. But, although he\r\nproved himself to be a remarkable swimmer, he could not go faster than\r\nthe yawl, and finally Sam Barton, who was leaning so far over the bow\r\nof his boat that he seemed to be in danger of losing his balance and\r\nfalling into the water, was near enough to the fisher-boy to fasten\r\ninto the collar of his shirt with the boat-hook.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, you're ketched,\" said he, savagely, as he began to pull\r\nhis prisoner toward the boat. Bob evidently thought so too; but he\r\ndetermined to keep up the fight as long as there was a chance for\r\nescape, and, suddenly raising up in the water, he seized Sam by the\r\nhair with one hand, while with the other he attempted to release his\r\ncollar from the boat-hook.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by here, somebody!\" exclaimed Sam, who felt his prisoner\r\nslipping through his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Help! help!\" shouted the fisher-boy with all the strength of his\r\nlungs. \"Thieves! Robbers! Mur--\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerusalem!\" ejaculated Will Atkins, alarmed by the noise; and,\r\nseizing Bob by the shoulders, he plunged his head under the water to\r\nsilence his shouting.\r\n\r\n\"Choke him loose, lads!\" said the chief, trying to unclasp the\r\nfisher-boy's fingers from his hair. \"That's it! Now, Tommy, hand me\r\nthat ar rope, an' you, Jack, ketch him by the shoulders an' stand by to\r\nh'ist him into the boat when I give the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to drown me?\" gasped Bob, struggling to keep his head\r\nabove the water. \"Let go your hold, Bill Stevens!\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy there, with that tongue of yours!\" replied Sam, \"or down you\r\ngo again! Have you got a good hold on him, fellers? Now, then,\" he\r\ncontinued flourishing the boat-hook above his head, \"one word out of\r\nyou, Bobby Jennings, an' I'll give you a taste of this. I aint one of\r\nthem kind as stands much nonsense. Haul him into the boat, lads.\"\r\n\r\nJack Spaniard and Friday exerted all their strength, and in a moment\r\nmore the fisher-boy had been pulled into the boat, where he was at once\r\nthrown upon the bottom and held by three or four of the band, while\r\nFriday and Sam tied his hands behind his back with the rope. All this\r\nwhile Bob had fought desperately for his freedom. He did not hope to\r\nescape from his enemies, who so far out-numbered him, and held him at\r\nsuch great disadvantage, but he had resisted simply because it did not\r\ncome natural to him to surrender upon the demand of any such fellows as\r\nSam and his band. But all his struggles were useless now. They could do\r\nhim no good, and might be the cause of bringing him bodily harm; and,\r\nknowing that it would be very poor policy to raise the bully's anger,\r\nhe submitted to his captors with as good a grace as he could command,\r\nand permitted them to tie him hand and foot.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said the chief after he had satisfied himself that Bob was\r\nsecurely bound, \"put out that light, an' we'll go back to the cave. If\r\nyou have raised any of them fellers in the harbor by your hollerin' an'\r\nyellin', you'll be sorry for it, Bobby Jennings. I guess you won't go\r\nround in your fine skiff, drivin' honest boys away from their work any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nSam had traveled the road so often that he could find their\r\nhiding-place in the dark quite as readily as by the aid of a lantern.\r\nPresently he ran the bow of the yawl upon the shore, and, after\r\nlistening a moment to make sure that no one in the harbor had been\r\nalarmed by the fisher-boy's shouting, he ordered his followers to carry\r\nthe prisoner into the cave. Bob bore their rough handling without a\r\nword of complaint, and in a few moments he found himself lying on his\r\nback in the middle of the cave, where he speedily aroused a new enemy,\r\nin the shape of the bull-dog, which made desperate attempts to get at\r\nhim, and whose chain was almost long enough to allow him to reach the\r\nprisoner. Bob several times heard his teeth snap like a steel-trap,\r\nwithin an inch of his ears, but when he tried to move farther away\r\nfrom the brute, he was instantly pounced upon by two of the band, who\r\nseemed to be afraid that, bound hand and foot as he was, he might still\r\nsucceed in effecting his escape.\r\n\r\n\"Now, shut the door and light that lantern, somebody,\" commanded the\r\nchief. \"Friday, knock that dog down agin.\"\r\n\r\nJack Spaniard fumbled around in the dark for a moment, and then struck\r\na light, which revealed a scene that filled every boy in the cave with\r\nexcitement. Friday, in attempting to obey the governor's order, had got\r\nhimself into trouble. He had attacked the dog with the boat-hook, which\r\nhe had kept in his hand, to resist any attempt that the fisher-boy\r\nmight make at escape, but the brute, being determined to bite somebody,\r\nand probably cherishing a grudge against Friday for the beating he\r\nhad given him but a short time before, turned fiercely upon him, and,\r\nfastening his teeth in his arm, threw him to the floor; and when the\r\nlight from the lantern illumined the cave, he was shaking him as if he\r\nhad been a large rat.\r\n\r\n\"Jerusalem!\" exclaimed Will Atkins, and, catching up an ax, he was\r\nstarting to Friday's assistance, when he was checked by the stern voice\r\nof the chief.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, there,\" exclaimed Sam. \"If you hit that dog with that ax\r\nthere'll be a big fuss here. We mustn't hurt him, fur we need him to\r\nhunt goats with.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, pull him off!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you stand back an' let him alone,\" said Friday, who did not seem\r\nto be at all concerned. \"If I can't beat this dog in a fair tussel, I\r\ndon't want a cent.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the struggle, Friday kept a firm hold of his boat-hook; and\r\nnow that the lantern was lighted, so that he could see to use it,\r\nhe regained his feet, and showered his blows so fiercely upon his\r\nassailant, that, in less than half a minute, he was declared to be a\r\nbadly whipped dog, and Sam was obliged to interfere in order to save\r\nhis favorite from serious injury.\r\n\r\n\"You fellers needn't make up your minds to see much goat meat on the\r\ntable when we get to our island,\" said Friday, rolling up his sleeve\r\nto examine his arm, which, Tom was very much relieved to see was\r\nscarcely scratched \"We'll starve to death if we don't get no grub till\r\nthat ar dog ketches it fur us.\"\r\n\r\nQuiet being restored, the fisher-boy was placed in a sitting posture\r\nin the middle of the cave, with his back against the skiff; Sam seated\r\nhimself on the dry-goods box, while the others of the band disposed\r\nof themselves in various attitudes, and waited for their leader to\r\nspeak. Bob glanced hastily from one to the other of them, and he was\r\nsatisfied, from their looks, that the new member was the only one who\r\nwas prepared to say a word in his favor.\r\n\r\nTom was already sincerely repenting that he had ever joined the Crusoe\r\nband. He had been greatly terrified by the violence he had witnessed,\r\nhis face wore a timid, frightened expression, and his mouth was twisted\r\non one side as if he had half a mind to cry. It had been demonstrated\r\nto his satisfaction that his new friends were but very little, if any,\r\nbetter than so many young savages, and he trembled when he thought of\r\nwhat they would do to him if he should accidentally break any of the\r\nlaws of the band. Boys who could stand by and see one of their number\r\nengaged in a fight with a fierce bull-dog, without raising a hand to\r\nassist him, were not likely to be possessed of very kindly feelings;\r\nand if any misfortune should befall him while in their company, he\r\ncould not hope for sympathy from any of them. Another reason why Tom\r\nwished himself well out of the scrape was, because he believed that the\r\nevents of the last five minutes had endangered the existence of the\r\nsociety. We know that he was a famous manager, and that he could\r\nsee a long way ahead of him while every thing worked smoothly and to\r\nhis satisfaction, and no real obstacles were encountered; but now he\r\nwas sadly troubled. Had he been the chief of the band at that moment,\r\nhe would not have known how to act. He had readily fallen in with the\r\nbelief of the others that Bob ought to be captured, in order to prevent\r\nhim from revealing the secret of their hiding-place, and thus breaking\r\nup the band and putting a stop to their cruise; but now that they had\r\ngot him, he was like the man who drew the elephant in the lottery--he\r\ndidn't know what ought to be done with him. Sam Barton, however, was\r\nnot troubled with any gloomy foreboding. Although he had, at first,\r\nlooked very serious, and imagined all sorts of terrible things that\r\nwould happen to him now that his rival had discovered his secret, a\r\nhasty review of the situation had convinced him that his case was not\r\nso very desperate after all. Indeed, according to his way of thinking,\r\nsome such scrape as they had just got into was needed to establish\r\nhis society upon a firm basis. Although the members, without a single\r\nexception, appeared to enter heartily into all his plans, he was afraid\r\nthat, when the time for action arrived, one or two of the timid ones\r\nwould have some excuse for backing out. That was one reason, though not\r\nthe principal one, why he had stolen Bob's skiff. As all the members of\r\nhis band had assisted him in it, he had thus got a firm hold upon them;\r\nand, if any of them became restive, he could enforce obedience to his\r\ncommands by threatening to expose them to Mr. Grimes, the constable.\r\nThe capture of the fisher-boy would serve to convince the band that he\r\nwas in earnest, and that he was determined to carry out his plans in\r\nspite of all the obstacles that could be thrown in his way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOB A PRISONER IN THE CAVE. (Page 180.)]\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen will come to order agin,\" said Sam, assuming a very solemn\r\nair, and looking savagely at the fisher-boy. \"Of all the things that\r\nhave happened since I got to be governor, this yere is the beat! It\r\ndon't need a smart man to tell what would happen to us if this yere\r\nfeller should get a chance to tell Mr. Grimes of what he has seed here;\r\nso the best thing we can do is to take care that he don't get back to\r\nthe village in a hurry. Bobby Jennings, we shall keep you prisoner\r\nhere until we get ready to start for our island. Friday, you an' Jack\r\nSpaniard tie that ar dog right here in front of the door; an' then,\r\neven if he does get his hands an' feet loose, he can't get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I object to this way of doing business!\" drawled Tom, as\r\nFriday and Jack untied the dog and began to drag him toward the door.\r\n\"We don't want to keep Bob a prisoner here! How long do you suppose it\r\nwill be before his absence will be discovered, and search made for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let 'em search!\" returned Sam. \"They won't find him, an' mebbe\r\nthey'll think he is drownded, or that he has run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we don't keep him here, what will we do with him?\" demanded Will\r\nAtkins. \"Haint you got no sense at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I want you to quit asking me if I haven't got any sense!\"\r\ndrawled Tom. \"I know as much about managing affairs of this kind as you\r\nor any one else in the band.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see it!\" said the chief. \"A purty captain you would make now!\r\nIf we should let him go, he'd have us all in jail in less than an hour:\r\nwouldn't you, Bobby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I would,\" replied the fisher-boy, promptly. \"That would be the\r\nbest place in the world for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, you wouldn't put me in jail, Bob Jennings,\" drawled Tom. \"I\r\nhaven't done any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't?\" exclaimed Sam. \"That's a purty story, aint it, fellers?\r\nYou're jest as deep in the mud as we are. Aint you a member of our\r\nband, an' didn't the band steal the skiff? The meetin's out, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I didn't have any thing to do with the skiff,\" whined Tom, who was\r\nutterly amazed at the bully's impudence. \"I didn't join the band until\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said the meetin's out!\" interrupted the governor. \"If you have any\r\nthing to growl about you must keep it until we come here agin. Now,\r\nBobby,\" he added, turning to the prisoner, \"you've been ketched actin'\r\nthe part of a spy; an' 'cordin' to law, you had oughter be chucked into\r\nthe harbor. Howsomever, if you will behave yourself like a man had\r\noughter do, we won't do you no harm. You have seed enough of this dog\r\nto know that he's mighty rough on strangers, an' if you know any thing\r\nyou'll not try to get away from us. If you do--well, you'll find out\r\nwhat'll happen.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spreading an old sail upon the floor of the cave for the\r\nfisher-boy to lie down upon, and tightening up the ropes with which\r\nhis hands and feet were confined, Sam again informed the band that the\r\n\"meeting was out,\" and ordered them to get ready to start for home.\r\nThe chief, as usual brought up the rear, remaining after the others\r\nhad gone, to see that every thing was right about the cave. He paused\r\na moment at the door, to assure the fisher-boy that the best thing he\r\ncould do was to remain quietly a prisoner, and then he pushed the board\r\nback to its place, and Bob was left to his meditations, and to the\r\ncompanionship of the bull-dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBOB FIGHTS FOR HIS LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo say that the fisher-boy was astonished at what had taken place,\r\nwould not half express his feelings. He had never imagined Sam to be\r\nso desperate a character, and never, until then, had he felt in the\r\nleast afraid of him. He had always believed himself to be able to beat\r\nthe bully at any of his games; but he now had learned that he had to\r\ndeal with one who was quite as smart as himself. Being taken prisoner,\r\nand confined like a felon, were new chapters in his experience. There\r\nwas no playing about it; it was a reality; and Sam and his band were\r\nin earnest. What would they do with him? was a question that the\r\nfisher-boy more than once asked himself, but without arriving at any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion. In fact, he did not intend that the governor\r\nshould have a chance to do any thing to him; for it was his intention\r\nto make some desperate attempts to effect his escape.\r\n\r\nThere was another thing that surprised Bob quite as much as his\r\ncaptors, and that was, that Tom Newcombe should condescend to become\r\na member of the organization, especially as he was obliged to take\r\na position in the ranks. But, after thinking the matter over, the\r\nfisher-boy saw through it all; and he imagined that he was quite as\r\nwell posted in regard to the object Tom had in view as was the new\r\nmember himself. The latter had repeatedly said that if he did not own\r\nand sail that yacht, no one about Newport should long enjoy it, and,\r\nfinding that his father had no intention of giving it to him, he had\r\nresolved to do something desperate. He at first decided to sink the\r\nStorm King in the harbor; and afterward he determined to go to sea in\r\nher. She was the most beautiful little vessel that had ever been seen\r\nabout the village, and he could not bear the thought of destroying her;\r\nand besides, by capturing her, and running her out to sea, he would\r\n\"get even\" with both his father and the principal at the same time.\r\nHe would take revenge upon the professor by depriving him of his fine\r\nyacht; and upon his father, by never again showing his face in Newport\r\nas long as he lived. But Tom could not do this by himself; he must\r\nhave help; for he knew that a guard-post would be established upon the\r\nvessel, which was to be kept in the bay, back of the academy, and that\r\nany attempt to capture her would be met with stubborn resistance. He\r\nknew, also, that there were a good many \"old sailors\" at the academy,\r\nwho would very soon fall in love with their new boat, if they hadn't\r\ndone so already, and that they would not hesitate to thrash any boy who\r\nmight be caught prowling around her at night, especially if they had\r\nthe slightest reason for supposing that he intended to do the yacht an\r\ninjury. If the society of Night-hawks had still been in existence, Tom\r\nwould have applied to its members for the help he needed, and, very\r\nlikely, he would have got it; but the village boys having all deserted\r\nhim, he was obliged to look elsewhere for friends. The first boy he\r\nthought of was Sam Barton. He knew him to be a very reckless fellow,\r\nand he believed that an expedition organized for the purpose of seizing\r\nthe Storm King would suit him exactly. More than that, Sam had a great\r\ndeal of influence with the ferry-boys, every one of whom would rush to\r\nhis standard, and Tom would again find himself the honored leader of\r\na secret organization. Tom and the governor talked this matter over\r\nwhile they were under the pier, and, although the bully was at first\r\ninclined to be suspicious of his visitor, who, he thought, was too\r\nmuch of a \"swell\" to associate with poor ferry-boys, he finally became\r\nconvinced that he was in earnest, and entered heartily into all his\r\nplans, with one exception. He promised to raise a crew large enough to\r\nseize the yacht, and to take her to sea after they had captured her;\r\nbut, as for getting up a new society, and making Tom captain of it,\r\nthat was another thing. He was the leader of a band of fellows, who,\r\nfor bravery and discipline, had never been equaled in the village, and\r\nif Tom would promise to keep every thing secret, and to obey all the\r\nlaws, he would take him in as a member. This proposition, of course,\r\ndid not exactly suit one who imagined that he was born to command,\r\nbut it was his only chance to obtain the assistance he needed, and he\r\nfinally consented; believing that, after he had become fairly settled\r\nas a member, he could induce the boys to break the chief, and appoint\r\nhim in his stead. So Tom became one of the Crusoe band; and while Will\r\nAtkins was following up the fisher-boy to see that he went home, Sam\r\nand the rest of his friends were seated in the yawl, under the pier,\r\ninitiating the new member into the mysteries of the society. As we have\r\nseen, he soon became heartily sick of the band. He had never before\r\nassociated with such a rough, quarrelsome set of boys, and if he could\r\nhave thought of any other plan to secure possession of the yacht,\r\nhe never would have put his foot inside the cave again. Moreover,\r\nthe bully, with an impudence and a disregard for truth that utterly\r\nconfounded the new member, had accused him of theft. The fisher-boy,\r\nangry as he was, could not help laughing when he recalled to mind the\r\nexpression of astonishment that passed over Tom's face, when the chief\r\ninformed him that if Bob escaped he would be in danger of being sent to\r\njail. Although he was not in very comfortable circumstances just then,\r\nhe could not help thinking that Tom's situation was worse than his.\r\n\r\nBob, however, did not waste a great deal of time in thinking about Tom\r\nNewcombe. He was too much interested in his own affairs just then;\r\nand scarcely had Sam disappeared, when he straightened up, and began\r\nto test the strength of the rope with which his hands were bound. It\r\nproved to be much too strong for him to break, but the knot, having\r\nbeen loosely tied, slipped a little, and that gave him encouragement.\r\nThe dog seemed to understand that he was placed at the door for the\r\npurpose of keeping an eye on the prisoner, for every time Bob moved,\r\nhe would give him notice that he was still wide-awake, by growling\r\nsavagely. The fisher-boy, however, was not very much afraid of him.\r\nBefore the light was put out, he had taken pains to examine the chain,\r\nwhich he noticed was sufficiently large and heavy to hold a good sized\r\nvessel; and, until the dog became strong enough to break that chain, he\r\nwas safe. He paid no heed to the warning growls, but devoted all his\r\nattention to the work of freeing his arms, which, for a long time, he\r\nhad hopes of being able to accomplish. But the governor had tied the\r\nrope himself, and, although the knot slipped a little at every exertion\r\nof strength, he could not loosen it sufficiently to enable him to free\r\nhis hands. Had he been fresh he might have succeeded; but, besides\r\nhaving done a hard day's work at his wood-pile, he was nearly exhausted\r\nby the efforts he had made to escape from the bully, and he began to\r\nfeel the need of rest. Stretching himself out on the sail, he settled\r\ninto as comfortable a position as it was possible for him to assume\r\nwith his hands and feet securely bound, wondered whether his mother was\r\nwaiting for him at home, and how long the governor intended to keep him\r\na prisoner, and in a moment more was fast asleep. How long he slept he\r\nwas unable to tell. He was aroused by the growling of the dog, and,\r\nafter listening a moment, he heard a slight noise outside the cave.\r\nThen the board was removed, and he recognized the voice of Sam Barton,\r\nordering the dog to keep silent.\r\n\r\n\"Bobby Jennings!\" said he, as soon as he had succeeded in quieting the\r\nbrute, \"be you there, all safe an' sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am!\" replied the fisher-boy. \"How do you suppose I could\r\nbe anywhere else after you have tied me hand and foot, and put a dog at\r\nthe door to guard me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said the chief, who seemed to be greatly relieved\r\nto learn that his prisoner had not found means to effect his escape.\r\n\"Come in, Friday, an' strike a light.\"\r\n\r\nBob heard the two boys stumbling about in the darkness; for, although\r\nit was broad daylight, the cave was as dark as it had been at midnight,\r\nand when the lantern was lighted, he saw that Sam carried a huge slice\r\nof meat in one hand, and a tin dinner pail in the other.\r\n\r\n\"Here's your share,\" said he, throwing the meat to the dog; \"an' now,\r\nBobby, if you'll promise, honor bright an' no jokin', not to try any\r\ntricks on us, we'll untie your arms an' give you a chance to eat the\r\ngrub we've brought you.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy readily promised to behave himself, for he was tired\r\nof sitting with his hands bound behind him. \"How do you suppose that\r\nI could get away?\" he asked, as Sam began to remove the rope from his\r\narms. \"You are both as large as I am, and besides, you've got a dog to\r\nhelp you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nothin',\" said Friday. \"We aint a goin' to trust you too fur,\r\nan' that's jest all about it. No tricks, now.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Bob had stretched his cramped arms he felt so much better that\r\nhe asked Sam to untie his feet, a request which the latter positively\r\nrefused to grant. \"You don't need your legs to eat breakfast with,\"\r\nsaid he; \"so pitch into that bread an' taters, an' don't keep us\r\nwaitin'.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever else Bob had to say about the governor of the Crusoe band, he\r\ncould not accuse him of wishing to starve him, for Sam had filled the\r\nbucket with all kinds of eatables that he had been able to procure.\r\nNever had a better breakfast been served up to him, and never had he\r\neaten a meal in so romantic a spot as the cave appeared to be at that\r\nmoment. Bob could not help feeling amused, and he thought that the\r\nscene there presented, was well worth the pencil of an artist. The\r\nfisher-boy sat on the piece of sail which had served him for a bed, his\r\nback against his skiff, his legs, which were stretched out straight\r\nbefore him, almost wrapped up in ropes, the dinner bucket at his side,\r\nand a slice of bread in one hand and a piece of cold meat in the other.\r\nOn one side of him stood the chief of the Crusoe band, his sleeves\r\nrolled up to his elbows, his hat pushed back on his head, one hand\r\nresting on the flour barrel, and the other holding the boat-hook which\r\nhad done him such good service the night before. In front of him stood\r\nthe governor's man, Friday, leaning carelessly against the wall, with\r\nhis arms folded; but within easy reach of him was a heavy oar, which\r\ncould be seized, in case the prisoner made any attempts at escape.\r\nThe space on the other side of him was occupied by the dog, which,\r\nhaving finished his breakfast, sat with his head turned on one side,\r\nwatching the bread and meat as it disappeared down Bob's hungry throat,\r\nno doubt envying him his enjoyment. The lantern, which stood on the\r\nflour barrel, beside the copy of Robinson Crusoe, threw a dim, ghostly\r\nlight over the scene, and the fisher-boy could almost bring himself to\r\nimagine that the old feudal times--stories of which he had read and\r\nwondered at--had returned, and that he was taking part in them; that\r\nthe cave represented the dungeon of some ancient castle, and that the\r\ngovernor and his man were the retainers of some cruel nobleman, into\r\nwhose hands he had fallen.\r\n\r\nWhile Bob was eating his breakfast, neither he nor his jailers spoke\r\na word. The latter evidently had nothing to talk about, and the\r\nfisher-boy, knowing that he could not say much that was complimentary\r\nto Sam and his band, thought it best to keep silent. The governor\r\nseemed to be in excellent spirits since he captured his rival, and\r\nBob knew that it was policy to keep him so if he could. He had not\r\nforgotten that Sam was the boy who had caused him a great deal of\r\ntrouble by sinking his scow, and stealing his fine skiff, but he could\r\nnot afford to show that he cherished revengeful feelings about it.\r\n\r\n\"Have you had enough?\" asked the chief, when the fisher-boy had\r\nfinished the last mouthful of his breakfast. \"If you haint, say the\r\nword, an' we'll fetch you more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had a great plenty,\" replied Bob; \"and now, Sam, I would like\r\nto know how long you intend to keep me a prisoner here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that depends!\" answered the governor; \"you see, Bobby, it\r\nwouldn't be a very smart trick fur us to let you out till we get ready\r\nto leave Newport. You know too much, an' you might be mean enough to\r\nmake us a great deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely I should,\" replied the fisher-boy, bluntly. \"But I would\r\nrather be kept here six months than to be in your boots when Mr. Grimes\r\ngets his hands on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't lose no sleep worryin' about us,\" returned Sam. \"If we\r\ndon't know enough to take care of ourselves we ought to get into\r\ntrouble. Now, we must bid you good-by, Bobby,\" he continued, as he\r\ncoolly proceeded to fasten his prisoner's arms behind him, \"an' we hope\r\nyou'll have a jolly time till we get back. Two is company, you know, so\r\nyou an' the dog can talk over your secrets without bein' afraid that\r\nsomebody will hear you. It aint no ways likely that we shall call on\r\nyou agin afore night, 'cause it aint exactly safe fur us to come here\r\noften durin' the day-time. If we hear any body askin' fur you, we'll\r\ntell 'em that the last time we seed you, you were in good health and\r\nspirits.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy listened in silence to this insulting speech, and\r\nscarcely had the door closed behind the governor, when, in spite of\r\nthe angry growls of the dog, he renewed his efforts to free himself\r\nfrom his bonds. He met with no better success than before; for Sam had\r\ntaken a great deal of pains in fastening the rope, and he was finally\r\nobliged to give it up as a bad job. For want of some better way to\r\npass the time, he stretched himself out on his hard bed, and tried in\r\nvain to go to sleep. The rope had been drawn so tightly that his arms\r\nbegan to swell, and this caused him so much pain that sometimes he\r\nfound it exceedingly difficult to keep back his tears. How he lived\r\nthrough the day, he scarcely knew. Time moved on laggard wings, and\r\nall he had to divert his attention, during the fourteen hours that\r\nelapsed between the visits of his jailers, were the rattling of the\r\nwagons on the pavement over his head, and the angry growls of the dog,\r\nwhich were kept up at short intervals, during the day. How Bob wished\r\nthat his hands were free! That brute, large and savage as he was, would\r\nnot long stand between him and his freedom. Then, for a long time, the\r\nfisher-boy lay with his face downward--that being the most comfortable\r\nposition he could assume--and pondered upon the chances of vanquishing\r\nthe dog, in case he should get into a fight with him.\r\n\r\nEight o'clock came at last, and with it arrived Sam Barton and his\r\nband, including Tom Newcombe, who brought a splendid double-barrel\r\nshot-gun, two jointed fish-poles, a quantity of hooks and lines, and\r\nalso his game chickens, all of which he offered to increase the\r\ngeneral stock. Every thing was accepted, in spite of the objections\r\nraised by Will Atkins, who argued that not only did the book fail to\r\nmention whether or not Crusoe's gun was a double-barrel, but it was\r\nalso silent on the subject of game chickens. It said nothing about\r\nfish-poles either, especially jointed ones; and to show that his\r\nobjection was well founded, Atkins picked up the book, and turned to a\r\npicture which represented Robinson catching a dolphin with a hand-line.\r\nThe governor listened patiently to all he had to say, but he failed to\r\ndiscover any reason why he should not adhere to his decision.\r\n\r\n\"Any body with half sense could see that a double-barrel gun is a handy\r\nthing to have about,\" said the chief. \"'Spose Tommy should happen to\r\nget into a fight with two Injuns, while he was out alone on the island,\r\nhunting for goats! couldn't he easy kill 'em both? Fish-poles, too, are\r\nsometimes worth more'n they cost. Mebbe our island, when we find it,\r\nwill be different from Crusoe's. Mebbe there'll be creeks on it, with\r\nsunfish an' perch in 'em; an' whoever heared of ketchin' them kind of\r\nfish with hand-lines? An' as fur them game chickens, they will be jest\r\nthe things we need. We may get tired of livin' on turtle's eggs, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no odds,\" replied the dissatisfied member. \"You wouldn't\r\ntake that ar watch of mine, an' I aint a goin' to let them things of\r\nTommy's go, neither.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, Will Atkins stubbornly stuck out for what he believed to\r\nbe his rights, and the result was, that he very soon succeeded in\r\nexhausting all the patience of the chief, who backed him into a corner,\r\nand was about to reduce him to subjection, when Tom, who did not like\r\nto see any fighting, began to beg for him. The governor hesitated a\r\nmoment, undecided whether to listen to the appeals of humanity or to\r\nfollow the stern mandate of duty, and then released the culprit; not,\r\nhowever, without solemnly promising him that the very next time he\r\ndared oppose his chief, he would certainly suffer.\r\n\r\nWhile the band remained in the cave, the fisher-boy's arms were left\r\nunbound, so that he could eat his supper; but as soon as the general\r\nbusiness of the society had been transacted, the governor ordered Bob\r\nto get ready to be tied up again, and the band to adjourn to the yawl\r\nfor the purpose of talking over some of their plans.\r\n\r\nThey did not want their prisoner to overhear them, and, as they were\r\nafraid to trust him outside of the cave, they were obliged to go out\r\nthemselves. The chief appeared to be very much concerned about the\r\ncomfort of the fisher-boy, for, when he saw how badly his arms were\r\nswollen, he tried a new way of confining them. He cut off about two\r\nfeet of the rope, each end of which he made fast to the prisoner's\r\narms, above the elbows, with a \"round turn and two half hitches.\" This\r\nleft Bob's hands and the lower part of his arms free--an advantage\r\nthat he was quick to perceive, and which he determined to use, if an\r\nopportunity was offered. As soon as this operation was performed, Sam\r\nand his band left the cave, and for the next half hour an animated\r\ndiscussion was carried on outside the door. The fisher-boy, believing\r\nthat some important plan was being talked over, listened with all his\r\nears; but, to his disappointment, he could not catch a word of what was\r\nsaid, for the boys talked in whispers. Finally, the chief re-entered\r\nthe cave, and, after examining the prisoner's bonds, he extinguished\r\nthe lantern, and went out again. Bob heard a slight splashing in the\r\nwater as the yawl moved away, and when he was sure that the band had\r\nleft the vicinity of the cave, he straightened up and prepared to put\r\ninto execution a plan for escape which he had thought over while the\r\ndebate was going on at the door. Putting his hand into his pocket he\r\npulled out a large jack-knife which he opened with his teeth, and in\r\nless time than it takes to write it, his arms were free. The work of\r\nreleasing his legs was quite as quickly accomplished. A few rapid blows\r\nwith the knife severed the rope with which they were confined, and then\r\nBob slowly, and with great difficulty, raised himself to his feet.\r\n\"Hold on there,\" said he to himself, as a loud growl from the dog gave\r\nhim notice that every move he made was being closely watched, \"I'll be\r\nready for you in a very few minutes!\"\r\n\r\nBut in this the fisher-boy was mistaken. His \"few minutes\" proved to be\r\nnearly half an hour; and even at the end of that time he had scarcely\r\nrecovered the use of his legs. But delays were dangerous--perhaps he\r\nhad already wasted too much time--and as soon as he could walk without\r\nleaning against the wall, he was ready to attend to the dog, which\r\nmust be put out of the way before he could leave his prison. Bob did\r\nnot intend to fight him in the dark, however, for that would give the\r\nanimal too much advantage. He knew there was a box of matches on one of\r\nthe shelves at the left hand of the door, for he had heard his jailers\r\nfeeling around for it every time they came in, and his first hard work\r\nmust be to find it. There was no danger of stumbling upon the dog in\r\nthe darkness, for the animal kept up an incessant barking and growling,\r\nand thus Bob was able to keep out of his reach. He had no difficulty\r\nin finding the shelves, and after a few moments search, during which\r\nhe several times stopped and listened, almost imagining that he heard\r\nhis enemies returning, he placed his hand upon the box of matches. The\r\nnext thing was the lantern. Securing that was a more difficult and\r\ndangerous task, for the chief had left it on the flour barrel, where he\r\ncould not get at it without placing himself within reach of the dog.\r\nBob lit one of the matches, and took a hurried survey of the cave.\r\nDirectly in front of him was the dog, which was standing upon his hind\r\nlegs, and jumping the full length of his chain in his efforts to reach\r\nthe prisoner. Behind the dog was the flour barrel, on which stood the\r\nlantern. In one corner of the cave, opposite the door, was a pair of\r\noars, either one of which was long enough to reach from where he stood\r\nto the flour barrel. By the time Bob made these observations the match\r\nwas consumed. He lit another, and picked up one of the oars, which\r\nhe extended toward the lantern, when the dog seized the blade in his\r\nteeth and literally smashed it in pieces. In return for the damage he\r\nhad done, he received a blow over the head from the handle of the oar,\r\nwhich knocked him down. The fisher-boy hoped he had finished him; but\r\nbefore he had time to make any observations his match went out. A third\r\nwas struck, and the dog was discovered upon his feet again, apparently\r\nas full of fight as ever; but when Bob stretched the oar out toward the\r\nlantern, he backed over against the door.\r\n\r\nHis first attempt to catch the handle of the lantern upon the end of\r\nthe oar was a failure; so were the second and third, on account of the\r\ninterference of the dog. The fourth, however, was successful; and after\r\nhe had picked up the wick so that the lamp would give a strong light,\r\nhe began to look about the cave for some more suitable weapon than the\r\nstump of the oar. A small hatchet, which was stowed away on one of the\r\nshelves caught his eye. That was just the thing he needed; and, after\r\nplacing the lantern upon the shelf where it could not get knocked over\r\nduring the struggle, Bob took the hatchet in his hand, rolled up his\r\nsleeves, and began the fight without ceremony. There was a little more\r\nbarking and growling, a few desperate springs, a savage blow with the\r\nhatchet, then one or two convulsive kicks, and that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of Sam Barton's favorite, too. It had all been done\r\nin a moment, and the fisher-boy was glad indeed that it was so. Had\r\nthe struggle been a protracted one, as he had expected it would be,\r\nthe result might have been different. Not only was he totally unfit\r\nto sustain a lengthened contest, but he knew the necessity there was\r\nof getting out of the cave as soon as possible. He was unable to tell\r\nwhere the governor and his band had gone, or how soon they would\r\nreturn, and the quicker he left his prison the better would be his\r\nchances for escape; for, although the dog was out of the way, his\r\nfreedom was by no means assured. Hastily extinguishing the lantern, the\r\nfisher-boy crept up close to the door and listened. All was still, and\r\nbelieving that the coast was clear, he removed the board and crawled\r\ncautiously out of the cave; but, just as his feet touched the ground,\r\na pair of strong arms were thrown around his neck, and before he could\r\nthink twice, he found himself flat on his back, with the governor, his\r\nman Friday, and Jack Spaniard on top of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sam and the band went out of the cave, it was to listen to the\r\nreport of Jack Spaniard and Friday, who, it will be remembered, were\r\nthe ones selected by the chief to ascertain whether or not a post had\r\nbeen established on board the Storm King, and, if so, how many students\r\ncomposed the guard. They had performed their duty faithfully, and the\r\nconclusion at which they arrived was, that the yacht could be easily\r\ncaptured. The majority of the band agreed with them, and was in favor\r\nof making an immediate attack. They had heard enough during the day to\r\nsatisfy them that the fisher-boy's mysterious disappearance was causing\r\na great deal of talk about the village, and the sooner they got ready\r\nto start upon their cruise, the more likely they would be to escape\r\nquestioning. Some of the timid ones, however--among whom, of course,\r\nwas Tom Newcombe--remembering the bayonets with which the students were\r\narmed, felt their courage rapidly giving way, and strongly objected to\r\nan attack being made upon the vessel. It was a very easy matter for\r\nthem to sit in their cave and talk about it, and boast of the bravery\r\nthey would exhibit when the time for action arrived--as some of the\r\nband had done--but now, that there was a probability that they would\r\nsoon be called upon to make a display of their valor, they were ready\r\nto back out.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we give up the idea of capturing the yacht,\" said Tom. \"It's\r\ndangerous; and, besides, your yawl will answer our purpose just as\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Muley! what has got into you all of a sudden?\" demanded the\r\nchief. \"You seem to be monstrous glum about something. You want us to\r\ntake the vessel away from them fellers, don't you? Well, how are we\r\ngoin' to get it? They won't give it up without a fuss.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the new member would have found it exceedingly difficult to\r\ntell exactly what he wanted. He was as anxious as ever to punish his\r\nfather and the principal, by taking the Storm King, but he was not\r\nbrave enough to face the weapons of the guard; for he knew that all\r\nthe students were very expert in the bayonet exercise, and, as they\r\nwere not wanting in courage, they would very likely give Crusoe and his\r\nmen a warm reception. Perhaps if he had been the captain of the band,\r\nwith the same authority Sam was permitted to assume, and the members\r\nhad all treated him with the respect due the son of the richest man in\r\nthe village, and the fisher-boy had been out of the way, and he had\r\npositive evidence that his band exceeded the guard of the Storm King\r\nin numbers, so that her capture could be effected without danger to\r\nhimself--in short, if he could have arranged every thing to his liking,\r\nhe might have taken more interest in the affairs of the society. Or,\r\neven if he had been second in command, and it had been understood that\r\nhe was to be the captain of the vessel during the voyage, he might\r\nhave kept up some show of allegiance. But the members all treated him\r\nas an equal rather than superior; he had placed himself in the power\r\nof a tyrant, who ruled him with a rod of iron, who never deferred to\r\nhim, or asked his advice in regard to the manner in which the affairs\r\nof the band ought to be conducted, and, who being utterly ignorant of\r\nseamanship and navigation, would certainly get himself and crew into\r\nserious trouble during the voyage.\r\n\r\nTom had thought of all these things during the day, and he had got\r\nanother idea into his head. If the governor had known it, and had been\r\nas well acquainted with him as were some other boys about the village,\r\nthe new member would have been a prisoner as well as the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\nThe chief, for a wonder, listened patiently to what the members of the\r\nband had to say, but, being unable to decide the matter, he ordered\r\nthem into the yawl, and put off to make personal observations. Being\r\nfavored by the darkness, he ran so close to the vessel that he could\r\nhear the footsteps of the sentinel as he paced the deck. According to\r\nthe report of the spies, the guard consisted of four students, only one\r\nof whom was on duty at a time. The chief was very soon satisfied of the\r\ncorrectness of one part of this statement, for, had there been more\r\nthan one boy on guard, he would have heard more footsteps, and very\r\nlikely, some conversation.\r\n\r\nThe night was so dark that Sam could not possibly make any accurate\r\nobservations, and the most of the conclusions at which he arrived were\r\nthe result of guess-work. But he was satisfied with them, and after he\r\nhad rowed entirely around the vessel, he had decided upon his plans,\r\nand was ready to issue his orders.\r\n\r\n\"You an' Jack were right, Friday,\" said he, addressing himself to\r\nthe spies. \"That little craft is our'n, an' by sunrise, day after\r\nto-morrow, we'll be miles on our way toward our island. We'll go back\r\nto the cave now, an'--\"\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\" came the hail from the deck of the Storm King.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, let's get away from here!\" drawled Tom. \"We're discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\" shouted the sentinel again. \"Better keep off, if you don't\r\nwant to get into trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be any ways oneasy,\" replied the chief, who, seeing that\r\nthey were detected, thought it best to put a bold face on the matter.\r\n\"We're honest people, an' we're goin' home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you don't live around here,\" replied the student, \"and I tell\r\nyou that you had better keep away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know if this yere harbor has got to be private property\r\nsince you 'cademy fellers brought that boat here,\" said the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Corporal of the guard!\" shouted the sentinel.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, we'd better leave, I tell you,\" drawled Tom. \"He's calling the\r\ncorporal, and the first thing we know we'll get into trouble. We might\r\nbe captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not easy. They can't crowd swells enough into that craft to take us,\"\r\nsaid the chief; but, although he talked very boldly, he evidently\r\nthought it best to get a little farther away from the Storm King, for\r\nhe dropped his oar into the water and sculled from the spot. The crew\r\nof the yawl heard a hurrying of feet on the deck of the vessel, as\r\nif the students were taking their stations, in readiness to repel an\r\nattack; but that soon died away in the distance, and then the governor\r\npulled in his oar and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"Friday,\" said he, \"you an' that ar Jack Spaniard had oughter be\r\nchucked into the harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fur?\" asked both the spies at once. \"What have we been a doin'\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do to-day, when you came up here to find out how many\r\nfellers there was on board that vessel?\" demanded the chief.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we jest pulled round,\" answered Friday. \"We didn't raise no fuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't them soldiers speak to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; an' we told 'em that we was jest lookin' round.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sartin of it!\" said the governor. \"You've knocked our expedition\r\nhigher'n the top of Mr. Newcombe's warehouse. Them 'cademy swells are\r\non the watch now, an' I reckon we'll see some hot times before we can\r\ncall ourselves the masters of that craft. But that sha'n't stop me. I\r\nsaid I'd sail to our island in her, an' I'm goin' to keep my promise.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the Crusoe band were astonished, and not a little\r\nalarmed, at what had just transpired. To the chief it was as plain as\r\ndaylight, that something had happened to arouse the suspicions of the\r\nstudents, and he imagined it was the careless manner in which the two\r\nspies had executed his orders. In this he was mistaken; for the blame\r\nrested entirely with Tom Newcombe. During the day he had accidentally\r\nrun against some of the students on the street, and they, having been\r\nmade acquainted with the history of the yacht, could not resist the\r\ntemptation to talk to Tom about it.\r\n\r\n\"Newcombe,\" exclaimed Harry Green, who acted as spokesman for the\r\nparty, \"you don't know what you are missing by being shut up in that\r\noffice all day. Why don't you ask your father to let you come back to\r\nthe institute? We are having high old times there.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I don't care if you are!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"And just see here!\" continued Harry, pulling an official envelope, out\r\nof his pocket. \"Here's my appointment as first lieutenant in our navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" exclaimed Tom. \"I don't want to see it. I can't stop to\r\ntalk to you, either, for I am in a great hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we'll not detain you,\" said Harry. \"We'll walk with you. Did you\r\never hear of a man being an officer in both the army and navy at the\r\nsame time? Well, I am. I am captain of company A, and executive officer\r\nof the yacht. I wanted to be commander of her; but Bill Steele passed a\r\nbetter examination than I did. The students who are studying navigation\r\nare to act as her crew, and, in a few days, the colonel is going to\r\nput her into commission. He is going to send to Boston for a couple\r\nof small cannon for her, and as soon as they arrive, we're going on a\r\ncruise.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I don't know whether you are or not,\" roared Tom, who had\r\nmade several unsuccessful attempts to interrupt Harry. \"I'll show you\r\nsomething before you are many days older. I've got an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" whistled the first lieutenant of the Storm King, opening his\r\neyes in amazement. \"Have you organized another society, Newcombe, and\r\ndo you intend to go to sea in the yacht as we did in the Swallow?\"\r\n\r\nHarry, as we know, had formerly been a member of the Night-hawks, and\r\nhad taken an active part in Tom's runaway scheme; but the one month\r\nextra duty adjudged by the court-martial had opened his eyes, and as\r\nsoon as he had worked out the sentence, he turned over a new leaf. The\r\nresult was now apparent. He was the ranking captain at the academy, and\r\nthe second in command of the Storm King. He was well acquainted with\r\nTom, and it was a favorite saying of his that, when he got an idea into\r\nhis head, he was dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't tell you what I intend to do, did I?\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the lieutenant, \"but you have said enough to put me on\r\nmy guard. Now, Newcombe, if you want to see some fun, bring on your\r\nsociety and make an attempt to capture the Storm King. We'll take every\r\none of you to the academy as prisoners of war.\"\r\n\r\nIf any other boy in the village had hinted that it was his intention\r\nto capture the yacht, Harry would have thought it a capital joke; but\r\ncoming from the source it did, and knowing that Tom had accomplished\r\nwonders in this line, he deemed it best to be prepared for any\r\nemergency. He returned to the academy immediately, and reported the\r\nmatter to the lieutenant-colonel, who, just before dark, sent a guard\r\nof twelve students on board the yacht. It was fortunate for the members\r\nof the Crusoe band that they did not attempt to capture her.\r\n\r\nThe chief did not relinquish his hopes of being able to take the\r\nvessel, as soon as he was ready to start on his cruise, but he did not\r\nthen arrange any plan of attack, nor did he have much to say about\r\nthe business in hand, until he once more found himself safe under Mr.\r\nNewcombe's wharf. He guided the yawl to the landing, in front of their\r\nhiding-place, and was about to issue some orders to the band, when\r\nFriday intimated to him in a whisper that there was something unusual\r\ngoing on in the cave. The chief held his breath and listened intently;\r\nbut the noise, whatever it was, had ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Do you reckon that ar Bobby Jennings has got loose?\" he asked,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"If he has, we'd best look out,\" said Jack Spaniard. \"He won't be\r\nketched as easy as he was before. But I didn't hear nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did,\" said Friday. \"I heered the rattlin' of a chain, an' the\r\ndog a growlin' like he was fightin' something.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief waited to hear no more, but, stepping cautiously out of the\r\nyawl, he took his stand in front of the door and listened.\r\n\r\nThere was not a boy in the band who did not believe that their prisoner\r\nhad succeeded in freeing himself, and that he was at that very moment\r\non the point of leaving the cave. We ought, perhaps, to except Tom\r\nNewcombe, who now took no interest whatever in what was going on. He\r\ndid not care a straw whether the fisher-boy escaped or remained a\r\nprisoner, as he had come to the conclusion that he could not belong to\r\na society unless he was allowed to have a hand in the management of\r\nits affairs. The other members, however, preferred that Bob should not\r\nregain his liberty just then; but, although they well knew what would\r\nbe the result if he succeeded in getting away from them, there was not\r\none in the band, no, nor two, who would have dared to go into the cave\r\nto attempt his recapture. Sam Barton did not feel exactly safe, even on\r\nthe outside of the door; for, after he had listened a moment, he said,\r\nin a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Come up around me, fellers, and stick together. If he comes out, don't\r\ngive an inch.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of the governor's mouth when the board that\r\nconcealed the door was removed, and the fisher-boy crawled slowly out\r\nof the cave, only to fall into the arms of his rival.\r\n\r\n\"Hold him down, lads,\" said the chief, as Bob struggled furiously with\r\nhis captors. \"What's this yere he's got in his hand? A hatchet? Friday,\r\ntake it away from him! An' you, Xury, go into the cave an' fetch out\r\nthat rope. You were tryin' to get away, were you, Bobby Jennings? We'll\r\nfix you this time. It beats all the world how he got by that ar dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he's killed him,\" exclaimed Xury, who, on going into the cave\r\nafter the rope, stumbled over the body of Sam's favorite. \"If he aint\r\nas teetolly dead as a smoked herring, I hope I may never take another\r\npassenger across this harbor.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement created great consternation among the band, and some\r\nof the members were undecided whether to retain their hold upon the\r\nprisoner, or to jump up and take to their heels. From some cause or\r\nother, they seemed to believe that a boy who was brave enough to use a\r\nhatchet, even on a bull-dog, was a dangerous fellow to have about.\r\n\r\n\"Killed!\" repeated the governor, in astonishment. \"Be you sartin an'\r\nsure he's dead?\"\r\n\r\nXury struck a match in order to satisfy himself on that point; and as\r\nsoon as the lantern was lighted, Tom, who was the only one, besides\r\nthe boy in the cave, not employed in holding the prisoner, drawled out--\r\n\r\n\"O yes, he's as dead as a door-nail. If there's going to be so much\r\nquarreling and fighting goin' on, I don't want any thing more to do\r\nwith your society.\"\r\n\r\n\"There haint been no quarrelin' an' fightin' yet, that I know of,\" said\r\nthe chief, as he held Bob's arms behind him, while Friday tied them\r\nwith the rope Xury threw out to them. \"I don't allow no such work among\r\nmy men. Pick him up an' carry him in, lads,\" he added, as soon as he\r\nhad satisfied himself that his prisoner was once more secure. \"Now,\r\nBobby Jennings, I reckon you'll stay here fur awhile.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thought that passed through the fisher-boy's mind, when he\r\nagain found himself a prisoner, was, that the governor would revenge\r\nthe death of the dog by giving him a thrashing; but, to his surprise,\r\nhe had very little to say about it. After seeing his prisoner disposed\r\nof, he examined the oar which had been broken during the fight, looked\r\nat the hatchet Bob had used, and finally, he glanced at the dog. \"He\r\nwasn't much account, no how,\" said he. \"Any animal that'll let such a\r\nlookin' feller as Friday whip him in a fair fight, with nothin' but a\r\nboat-hook, wouldn't do much good huntin' goats. Ketch hold of the chain\r\nan' haul him out, lads.\"\r\n\r\nEvery member of the band lent prompt and cheerful assistance in\r\ncarrying out this order. The dog had not been a favorite with them, and\r\nthey were not sorry to get rid of him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" continued the governor, \"it's understood that to-morrow\r\nnight we'll capture that yacht an' be off fur our island. I don't mind\r\nsayin' this before you, Bobby Jennings, 'cause it aint no ways likely\r\nthat I'll be dunce enough to give you another chance to get away from\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are we goin' to do with him, governor?\" asked Will Atkins.\r\n\"If we leave him tied up here in the cave, he'll starve to death; an'\r\nif we let him go when we get ready to start, he'll be sartin to tell\r\nMr. Grimes of every thing that has been goin' on here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you jest let me alone fur takin' care of all such things as\r\nthat,\" replied the chief. \"If I haint got sense enough to know what had\r\noughter be done with him, I aint fit to be the leader of this band.\r\nWe'll take him with us, of course, an' land him on some island; an' by\r\nthe time he gets back here, we'll be miles an' miles at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, perhaps he can't find his way back,\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That's his lookout, an' not mine. He hadn't no business to go spyin'\r\nround here. If he had minded his own affairs, he wouldn't have been in\r\nthis trouble. Atkins, how much money have you got?\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifle over twenty dollars,\" answered the treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure you didn't spent none of it fur candy or pea-nuts!\" said\r\nthe chief, looking at him very sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Honor bright, I haint,\" replied Atkins, who had not forgotten the\r\nwhipping he once received for being unfaithful to his trust.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty dollars aint much to brag on,\" said the governor, thoughtfully.\r\n\"We'd had more if it hadn't been for you, Bobby Jennings.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you have got it?\" inquired the fisher-boy, who was greatly\r\ninterested in all the proceedings of the Crusoe band, even though he\r\nwas held as a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we wouldn't have started on our voyage until next week. That\r\nwould have give us time to paint this boat over, an' sell her to\r\nsomebody. You've jest cheated us out of fifteen or twenty dollars, by\r\nyour spyin' round, 'cause I know I could have sold the skiff fur that.\r\nNow, we'll have to be off at once; 'cause your mother is makin' a\r\nmonstrous fuss about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll certainly be found out,\" drawled Tom. \"If I was governor I\r\nwould set him at liberty immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Muley, who asked you fur any advice?\" demanded the chief,\r\nangrily. \"I am the head man of this band, an' I don't need no mates an'\r\nlieutenants, like they have up to the 'cademy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had oughter have some more grub,\" said Jack Spaniard, who was\r\ncommissary of the band. \"We haint got nothing but a few crackers, an'\r\nmebbe they won't last till we find our island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it aint best to buy none here,\" said the chief. \"We'll stop at\r\nsome city an' lay in a supply. I wonder if we'll go by Boston! Will we,\r\nMuley?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, how do I know!\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You had oughter know. You've been to sea, an that's one reason why I\r\nwanted you in the band. What do you say about it, Bobby? Will we see\r\nBoston?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" answered the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where Crusoe's island is, anyhow,\" said Xury. \"Mebbe we'll\r\nfind it, if we look around. Do you know where it is, Bobby?\"\r\n\r\n\"The book says it was somewhere near South America,\" replied the\r\nfisher-boy, who was astonished at the ignorance of the members of the\r\nband, and desirous of learning all their ideas on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Is that fur from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a very nice little journey. You'll be tired of life on\r\nship-board before you get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what makes you think that we won't see Boston, Bobby?\" inquired\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\n\"Because you don't know how to sail to get there; and, besides, if you\r\nsucceed in capturing the Storm King, you'll be wrecked before you get\r\nout of Buzzard's Bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know what's the reason! Didn't them 'cademy swells run\r\naway in the Swallow, an' didn't they go miles an' miles out of sight of\r\nland, an' never got wrecked?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did,\" replied Bob; \"but then, you must remember that there were\r\nsome excellent sailors among the students.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said Tom. \"I was first-mate of the Swallow during that\r\ncruise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any thing about navigation, Sam?\" asked the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is something every sea captain has to understand. It is the science\r\nthat teaches you what course to sail to reach the port you want to go\r\nto, and how to take advantage of the winds and currents.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor backed toward his seat beside the flour barrel, and made\r\nno reply. He did not quite understand what his prisoner had said to\r\nhim, but he could not help seeing that an obstacle had suddenly arisen\r\nin his path.\r\n\r\n\"The book don't say that Crusoe knew any thing about that,\" said Will\r\nAtkins, coming to the assistance of the chief.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it don't,\" said the governor, immensely relieved. \"But don't\r\nit say something about currents? When Crusoe tried to sail around his\r\nisland in his boat, he came near bein' carried out to sea an' lost. If\r\nwe don't look out, we might get in as much danger as he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely you'll get in more danger, if you ever go to sea in the\r\nStorm King,\" said the fisher-boy. \"Crusoe never was in any danger, for\r\nno such man ever lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bobby Jennings!\" exclaimed the governor, springing to his feet and\r\ncatching up the boat-hook, \"if you say that again I'll rap you over\r\nthe head. I know better! I know there was such a man, 'cause don't\r\nthis book tell all about him? He had a jolly time there on his island,\r\nhuntin' goats an' watchin' fur injuns, an' that's the way we're goin'\r\nto live. But we've talked long enough! Get to work, all of you, an'\r\npack up them things. While you're doin' that, I'll make some spears.\r\nYou know,\" he went on to explain, \"that every one of them 'cademy\r\nfellers has a gun with a bayonet on it! Them guns aint loaded, be they,\r\nMuley?\"\r\n\r\nTom replied that they were not.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right!\" continued the chief. \"I've just thought up a way to\r\nwhip 'em easy. I'll have to spile these oars, though.\"\r\n\r\nBob leaned back against his skiff and watched the preparations for\r\ndeparture with a good deal of interest. Several small dry goods boxes\r\nhad been provided for this very event, and while the band was busy\r\npacking away the outfit in them, the chief employed himself in making\r\nthe spears, which he did by cutting down the blades of the oars with\r\na hatchet. When the first one was completed, he handed it to Tom, and\r\nasked his opinion of it.\r\n\r\n\"You know all about them bayonets, Muley,\" said he. \"Can they reach as\r\nfur with them as we can with these spears?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, how can I tell?\" drawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sartin you know all about it, Muley, 'cause you've had a heap\r\nbetter chance to learn them things than I have. An' you know all about\r\nthem winds an' currents Bobby was talkin' about, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I've been to sea for nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No I don't; an' that's why I am goin' to make you captain of the\r\nyacht, when we get her. Will you take it, Muley?\"\r\n\r\nIf the governor could have read the thoughts that were passing through\r\nthe mind of the new member at that moment, he never would have offered\r\nhim the position of captain of the vessel. Tom had concluded that he\r\nhad seen enough of the Crusoe band; that he would have nothing more to\r\ndo with boys who could not appreciate the honor he conferred upon them\r\nby becoming a member of their society; and the last idea that had taken\r\npossession of him was, that he ought to contrive some way to punish\r\nSam Barton. The latter almost invariably addressed him in an imperious\r\ntone, as if he regarded it as his right to command, and Tom's duty to\r\nobey, and that was something the new member could not endure. He first\r\nthought he would turn traitor to the society, and expose every thing\r\nto Mr. Grimes, the constable. That would undoubtedly be a good way to\r\npunish the chief, but the latter would, very likely, be revenged by\r\ndisclosing the fact that Tom was a member of his band, and that he had\r\ntried to induce him to run away in the Storm King. That was something\r\nthe new member wanted to keep secret. If his father heard of it, there\r\nwas no knowing what might happen; and if it got to the ears of the\r\nvillage boys, they never would cease to torment him about it. Besides,\r\nif he took this way of punishing the governor, it would defeat the very\r\nobject for which Tom joined the Crusoe band. Sam would no doubt be put\r\nin jail, to be tried for stealing the skiff, and that would leave the\r\nyacht in the hands of the principal of the academy.\r\n\r\nHe very soon saw that this plan would not work, and the next resolve he\r\nmade was, that he would visit the fisher-boy after the band had gone\r\nhome, and offer to release him if he would promise that he would not\r\nsay a word about Tom's being a member of the society, and that he would\r\nput no obstacles in the way of the governor to prevent him from seizing\r\nthe yacht and leaving the village. By this arrangement, he could be\r\nrevenged upon the teachers of the academy, and upon the new officers\r\nof the Storm King, and no one would suspect that he had had any thing\r\nto do with the matter. It was by no means certain that this plan would\r\nhave worked, had it been put to the test, but still the new member had\r\ndecided to try it, when the chief's offer drove all these ideas out of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Muley?\" asked Sam. \"Will you take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied Tom, eagerly. \"I am glad to see that you have come\r\nto your senses. I didn't think you would be foolish enough to try to\r\ntake the vessel to sea yourself. You would very soon have got us into\r\ntrouble, for it needs somebody who understands the winds and currents\r\nto fill so responsible a position. I'll take it, if you will call me\r\ncaptain hereafter. I never did like that other name.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bargain,\" said the governor. \"Now, listen, men,\" he added,\r\nturning to the band. \"Muley's name is changed to cap'n. He is to be\r\nmaster of the vessel when we get her, an' he is the second officer in\r\nthe band till we reach our island.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys raised no objections to this arrangement; in fact, they were\r\ndelighted with it; for they had been convinced, by what their prisoner\r\nhad said, that they could not proceed very far on the journey toward\r\ntheir island without some competent person to take command of the\r\nvessel; and as they knew that Tom had been on a six months' voyage, and\r\nthat he had been second in command of the sloop, during the cruise of\r\nthe Night-hawks, they thought he was just the very man they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said the chief, after all the articles that comprised\r\ntheir outfit, except the guns, had been packed away in the dry goods\r\nboxes, \"that's all we can do to-night. We'll keep the guns out, to\r\nscare them 'cademy fellers. When we board the yacht we'll have a gun,\r\ncocked an' capped, in one hand, an' a spear in the other, an' we'll\r\nmake 'em believe that if they raise any fuss, or show fight, we'll\r\nshoot 'em down. But the spears are what we'll have to depend on. The\r\nmeetin's out, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor then carefully examined the ropes with which the prisoner\r\nwas confined; after which he ordered the band into the boat, and Bob\r\nwas once more left to his meditations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK ON THE YACHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Newcombe's feelings had undergone a very great change during the\r\nlast ten minutes. He was an officer now, and he no longer thought of\r\nturning traitor to the band, or of releasing the fisher-boy; but he was\r\nwilling to use his best endeavors to render the expedition successful.\r\nIt was not his intention to long answer to the name of captain; he\r\npreferred to be called governor; and he would use the office Sam had\r\ngiven him as a stepping-stone to something higher.\r\n\r\nTom had but one object in life. It occupied all his waking thoughts;\r\nhe dreamed about it when he was asleep; and from it sprang all these\r\nridiculous ideas he sometimes got into his head. He wanted to live\r\nat his ease. He desired to engage in some occupation that would run\r\nalong smoothly, without any care or exertion on his part, and in which\r\nhe would be free from the troubles and perplexities that fell to the\r\nlot of ordinary mortals. He had become greatly interested in Sam\r\nBarton's plan, and he believed that all that was needed to insure him\r\nunbounded happiness for the remainder of his days, was a habitation\r\non some desert island, in the middle of the ocean, where, in company\r\nwith half a dozen congenial spirits, he could while away the hours of\r\na dreamy existence, with no stern father to demolish his air-castles,\r\nand no merciless village boys to make sport of his grand ideas. Then\r\nthere would be nothing to trouble him, and he could pass the time\r\nserenely in hunting goats, squirrels, and quails--he did not intend\r\nto stop until he found an island that abounded in small game of every\r\ndescription--and when he became weary of the sport, he could lounge\r\nin the shade of his tent, and eat raisins and talk to his parrot.\r\nAlthough he was not just then on very good terms with Johnny Harding,\r\nGus Miller, and Harry Green, he would have preferred their society to\r\nthe companionship of the ignorant ferry-boys, who were continually\r\nshowing the muscles on their arms, and who talked about nothing but the\r\nnumerous fights in which they had been engaged.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was out of the question; and, rather than remain in the\r\nvillage, to be tormented by his acquaintances, he would go with the\r\nCrusoe band. But, in order to enjoy himself to the fullest extent,\r\nhe must be chief of the organization. He had managed societies which\r\nnumbered thirty and forty members, and managed them well, too, and he\r\ncould not be satisfied with any divided authority. Sam Barton must give\r\nplace to his betters--that was a settled fact. There was one point Tom\r\ncould not decide just then, and that was how to go to work to induce\r\nthe band to break the chief and appoint him in his stead. But in this\r\nhe concluded that he would be governed by circumstances, hoping that\r\nwhen the proper time arrived, something would \"turn up\" in his favor.\r\nAs soon as he became fairly established as chief of the band, Sam must\r\nbe disposed of, for he was a dangerous fellow, and might make him a\r\ngreat deal of trouble. Perhaps the best thing that could be done with\r\nhim would be to put him ashore on some island, as he intended to do\r\nwith the fisher-boy.\r\n\r\nTom thought these matters over before he went to sleep that night, and\r\nthey were the first that came into his mind when he awoke the next\r\nmorning. As soon as he had eaten his breakfast, he went down to the\r\noffice, and at the door he met two boys, who, he afterward learned,\r\nwere the midshipmen belonging to the Storm King. Of course they were\r\nacquainted with the particulars of Tom's business transactions with Mr.\r\nGraves, and, like all the rest of the village boys, they had something\r\nto say about it.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Newcombe?\" exclaimed one. \"We came here to inquire how\r\nmuch that vessel cost you. She is a beauty, and I am going to build one\r\nexactly like her when I get home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father is a capital fellow,\" said the other. \"He knows just what\r\nboys want, don't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, he don't!\" drawled Tom. \"He don't know what I want; if he did,\r\nhe would have given me that yacht. Never mind! You fellows had better\r\nlook out.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've understood that you have another idea. Why didn't you try to\r\ncarry it out last night? You were around there in a yawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, who said I was around there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we heard your voice. We were in hopes you would board us, for we\r\nwanted to see who belonged to your new society. Who are they, Newcombe?\r\nJohnny Harding says he is not a member.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your rank now, Tom? Grand commander, or general, or captain, or\r\nwhat!\"\r\n\r\nTom, too angry to reply, abruptly left the midshipmen, and walked into\r\nthe office. They would have followed him, but he slammed the door in\r\ntheir faces and locked it. As it was early in the morning, none of\r\nthe clerks had yet made their appearance, and Tom had the office to\r\nhimself. His first duty was to sweep out--a task he never executed\r\nwithout crying; for his idea was, that every time he performed any\r\nwork with his hands, he was disgracing himself. After he left the\r\nmidshipmen, he shed a few tears, and grumbled a good deal. \"Thank\r\ngoodness, this is the last time I shall ever sweep out this office,\"\r\nsaid he to himself. \"To-morrow morning, at this time, I shall be within\r\nsight of the ocean, and far away from Johnny Harding, and Harry Green,\r\nand all the rest of the fellows who are continually bothering me about\r\nthat yacht. I'll be my own master then, and if I ever touch a broom or\r\nduster again, I'll know the reason why. Of course, the vessel must be\r\nkept clean while we are on our cruise, but I am the captain, and I can\r\nmake the others do the work. When we reach our island, somebody will\r\nhave to sweep out the cave and tent; but I won't do it, for I'll be\r\ngovernor of the band by that time. I'll help plant the rice and wheat,\r\nand shoot goats, and keep a lookout for Indians, and have an eye on all\r\nthat is going on, for, of course, that is the duty of the governor; but\r\nI'll work when I please, and play when I feel like it; and there'll be\r\nnobody to say to me--? 'Thomas, you'll wear a poor man's clothes the\r\nlongest day you live!'\"\r\n\r\nAs was always the case with Tom, when about to engage in any of his\r\ngrand schemes, he lived in a state of intense excitement all that\r\nday. He was constantly harassed by the fear, which sometimes almost\r\namounted to a conviction, that something would happen to defeat the\r\nenterprise. The fisher-boy might succeed in making his escape; or Mr.\r\nGrimes, who, he knew, was closely watching Sam Barton, might discover\r\nsomething; or the guard of the yacht might be too strong for them, and\r\nhe and the rest of the band might be captured, and taken to the academy\r\nas prisoners of war; or the principal, or some of the students, might\r\ncall upon Mr. Newcombe and inform him that his son had another idea;\r\nin short, there were a thousand ways in which the affair might get\r\nnoised abroad. Tom was especially uneasy whenever any body spoke of Bob\r\nJennings. No one suspected that he knew any thing about him, but, as\r\nhe and the fisher-boy had been seen together a good deal of late, two\r\nor three of the clerks inquired what he had done with his \"friend and\r\npartner,\" and Tom drawled out in reply--\r\n\r\n\"O, now, is any body paying me for keeping an eye on that fellow?\"\r\n\r\nThe prevailing opinion seemed to be, that Bob, having become\r\ndiscouraged by the loss of his two boats, and despairing of ever being\r\nable to pay the debt he owed to Mr. Graves, had escaped from his\r\ntroubles by running away. Indeed, his mother was the only one in the\r\nvillage who thought differently. Of course, she could not account for\r\nhis disappearance, but she had faith in the good resolutions Bob made\r\nthe night he cut his new motto in the boards under the eaves, and she\r\nbelieved that time would make all things right.\r\n\r\nTo Tom's relief, the twelve o'clock bell rang at last. He went\r\nhome with his father, and, as soon as he had eaten his dinner, he\r\nwent up stairs to his room and packed his valise. When this was\r\naccomplished, he went down to the office again, where he lived in a\r\nmost uncomfortable frame of mind until six o'clock in the evening.\r\nThen there were two hours more to be passed away in some manner, for\r\nthe chief, the night before, had ordered the members of the band to\r\npresent themselves on an unfrequented part of the beach, in Fishertown,\r\nat eight o'clock. As the hour approached, Tom felt more and more like\r\nbacking out. He was troubled with the most gloomy thoughts, in which\r\nthe elements seemed to sympathize with him. About half-past seven,\r\na furious storm arose. The lightning flashed incessantly, the wind\r\nblew a perfect gale, the rain fell in torrents, the surf roared on the\r\nbeach, and the would-be captain of the Storm King, as he stood at his\r\nwindow and looked out into the darkness, shuddered at the thought of\r\ntaking a vessel to sea in the face of such a tempest. It was a wonder\r\nthat his courage did not give away altogether; but he recalled to mind\r\nthe treatment he had already experienced at the hands of the village\r\nboys, pictured to himself the life of glorious ease he could lead, when\r\nhe once became fairly settled on his island, and drawing in a long\r\nbreath, he caught up his valise, walked cautiously down stairs and out\r\ninto the storm, and, without a single feeling of remorse, turned his\r\nback upon the home he hoped never to see again. Without stopping to\r\nlook behind him, he hurried along the streets in the direction of the\r\nbeach, being obliged to stop and turn his back to the storm now and\r\nthen, to recover his breath. He passed through Fishertown, which seemed\r\nto be entirely deserted, and bent his steps toward a dilapidated cabin\r\nthat stood on the beach, so close to the water's edge that the surf\r\nwashed over his feet as he approached the door. All was dark within,\r\nbut as Tom entered, a voice, which was almost drowned by the whistling\r\nof the wind through the rafters, and the roaring of the waves on the\r\nbeach, called out--\r\n\r\n\"Who comes there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Newcombe,\" was the response.\r\n\r\nThe light of a lantern flashed through the darkness, and Tom discovered\r\nthe members of the Crusoe band crouching in one corner of the cabin,\r\ndrenched to the skin by the rain, which beat in upon them through the\r\nbroken roof.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you, cap'n,\" said the governor, joyfully. \"We were\r\nafraid that you were goin' to back out, but I am satisfied now that you\r\ncan be depended on. If the clerk of the weather was a member of our\r\nsociety, he couldn't have given us a better night. But, cap'n, are you\r\nsure that you can handle the vessel after we get her? It's purty rough\r\noutside, an' many an old sailor would shake his head at the idea of\r\ngoin' to sea in such a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid,\" said Tom. \"Just give me one good mate, and I'll take\r\ncare of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how will Xury do? He's a good hand with a sail-boat, an' he's\r\ntraveled up an' down the bay often enough to know it like a book.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's just the man I want,\" said Tom, who felt that a great\r\nresponsibility had been removed from his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Xury,\" said the chief, \"you're first-mate of the yacht, now. Do jest\r\nas the capt'n tells you, an' you won't get us into no trouble. Pick up\r\nyour plunder, an' let's make a break; for the quicker we get to work,\r\nthe sooner we'll be on our way toward our island.\"\r\n\r\nAs the chief spoke, he hid his lantern under his coat, shouldered his\r\nbundle of clothing, and led the way out of the cabin to the yawl, which\r\nwas drawn up on the beach, out of reach of the surf. It required the\r\nexercise of considerable perseverance, and the outlay of the united\r\nstrength of the band, to launch the boat through the waves, and while\r\nthis was being done, Tom began to realize the fact that they had a\r\nmost uncomfortable night for their cruise. The wind swept the beach in\r\nfitful gusts, beating the rain and spray furiously into his face; and\r\nwhen the lightning illuminated the scene, he could see that the sky\r\nwas covered with black, angry-looking clouds, and that the waters of\r\nthe bay were being tossed about in great commotion, but Tom never once\r\nthought of turning back. Since he received the appointment of captain\r\nof the yacht, a new spirit seemed to have taken possession of him. He\r\nwas no longer afraid of facing the bayonets of the guard, and if the\r\nattack on the yacht had proved a failure, he would have been the first\r\nto propose that they should begin their cruise in Sam's yawl.\r\n\r\nRegardless of soiling his boots and clothing, he worked as hard as any\r\nof the band to launch the boat, wading in water up to his knees, and\r\nsometimes being almost smothered by the great waves that came rolling\r\ntoward the beach. The chief had been thoughtful enough to supply the\r\nyawl with oars, and it was well he did so. Even then, it was a long\r\ntime before they succeeded in getting fairly started. Slowly, inch by\r\ninch, they worked their way against the wind and waves, and at last\r\nthey reached the harbor, where the water was comparatively quiet. In\r\nten minutes more they were in their cave, and the governor breathed a\r\ngood deal easier when he found that his prisoner had not found means to\r\neffect his escape. Without any unnecessary delay, the band began the\r\nwork of carrying the dry goods boxes out of the cave, and stowing them\r\naway in the yawl. This was accomplished in a few minutes, and then the\r\ngovernor, after putting the volume of Robinson Crusoe carefully away in\r\nthe pocket of his pea-jacket, called his followers around him, to give\r\nthem their final instructions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said he, \"you fellers must take charge of your we'pons,\r\nan' when we get into the yawl, put them where you can get your hands on\r\n'em at a moment's warnin'. You can depend on these things,\" he added,\r\nas he distributed the spears he had made the evening before, \"'cause\r\nthey are as sharp as needles; an' if one of them 'cademy swells gets\r\npunched with 'em, I reckon he'll walk turkey. I don't 'spose we'll\r\nhave much chance to use 'em, 'cause it aint no ways likely that them\r\nsoldiers are loafin' about the deck in this storm; but, after all,\r\nit's best to be on the safe side. Friday, when we start, you will take\r\nthe bow oar. We will come up alongside of the yacht, an' the minute we\r\nstop, you will jump out an' make the yawl's painter fast to something.\r\nWhile you are doin' that, the rest of us will board her, an' the first\r\nthing them 'cademy fellers know, we'll have 'em fastened up in the\r\ncabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, what will we do?\" asked Tom; \"if we shut the students up in the\r\ncabin, I can't go down there to get to my state-room; and I am not\r\ngoing to sleep on deck while I am captain. It wouldn't look well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we'll rush 'em down through the cabin an' into the hold,\"\r\nsaid the chief. \"But, whatever we do, we must be lively about it,\r\n'cause it aint best to give 'em a fair show. Now, if we are all ready,\r\nwe'll be off. We'll leave your skiff in the cave here, Bobby, an' when\r\nyou get back, you'll know where to find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't you let me loose, Sam?\" asked the fisher-boy. \"I don't like\r\nto go out in this storm with my hands and feet tied. Suppose the yawl\r\nshould be capsized, what would become of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't you be uneasy,\" replied the governor. \"We'll take care of\r\nyou, an' so long as you behave yourself, like a man had oughter do,\r\nwe'll see that nothin' don't harm you. Pick him up and take him out,\r\nlads.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his remonstrances, Friday and Jack Spaniard took Bob up in\r\ntheir arms, carried him out of the cave, and laid him away in the yawl,\r\nunder the thwarts, as if he had been a log of wood. He was far from\r\nbeing satisfied with the chief's assurance that he would take care of\r\nhim. He knew that Sam was a skillful boatman, but the storm was still\r\nraging violently, and in the confusion occasioned by boarding the yawl,\r\nsome accident might happen. However, there was no help for it. He was\r\nsecurely bound, and all he could do was to commend himself to his usual\r\ngood luck, and abide the issue.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had been disposed of, the band took their places in the\r\nyawl, and the governor once more went into the cave, to make sure that\r\nnothing was left behind. Then, after carefully closing the door, he\r\nsprang into the yawl, and shoved off into the darkness. They went the\r\nentire length of the harbor, and through all the shipping that lay\r\nat the wharves, without accident, and finally, a flash of lightning\r\nrevealed to them the Storm King, riding at her anchorage, in the rear\r\nof the academy grounds, which here extended down to the water's edge.\r\n\r\n\"Give way strong,\" commanded the chief, in an excited voice. \"Friday,\r\nyou be ready to jump out with that painter the minute we stop. Bobby\r\nJennings, one word out of you, an' you go overboard. Remember, lads,\r\none quick rush, an' she's our'n. Stick together, an' don't be afraid to\r\npunch the first one that shows fight.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew bent to their oars with a will, and the yawl skimmed over the\r\nwaves like a duck. The governor, who was at the helm, kept the boat\r\nheaded up the harbor until he passed the yacht, when he rounded to\r\nunder her stern, and ran up alongside of her, without being hailed.\r\n\r\n\"Way enough,\" whispered the chief. The oars were taken in and laid upon\r\nthe thwarts. Friday sprang up with the painter in one hand, and the\r\nboat-hook in the other. The governor stood in the stern-sheets, holding\r\nhis lantern under his coat, and directing the yawl's course through the\r\ndarkness, while the rest of the crew caught up their spears and awaited\r\nthe further commands of their leader. The yawl continued to approach\r\nthe vessel, and presently she was lifted on the crest of a wave, at\r\nthe same instant that a flash of lightning showed the Crusoe band\r\nthat the sloop's deck was deserted, with the exception of a solitary\r\nsentinel, who, wrapped up in his overcoat, stood sheltering himself\r\nbehind the mast.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, in spite of all the governor's efforts to prevent it,\r\nthe yawl was dashed against the side of the vessel with a shock that\r\nwould have aroused all the students on board of her, if they had not\r\nbeen the very soundest of sleepers.\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\" shouted the sentinel, running to the side, and looking\r\ndown into the darkness. \"By gracious? corporal of the guard!\" he added,\r\nin a louder tone, as another flash of lightning revealed the yawl and\r\nher crew. \"Better keep off, if you don't want to get into trouble.\r\nCorporal of the guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tumble up lively, lads,\" exclaimed the governor, and, suiting the\r\naction to the word, he sprang upon the deck of the Storm King, only to\r\nbe met by a savage thrust from the bayonet of the guard, who manfully\r\nstood his ground, and shouted for the corporal. Fortunately for the\r\nchief, his man Friday was close at hand. He had made the yawl's painter\r\nfast, and charged upon the sentinel with his boat-hook, just in time to\r\nprevent him from doing the governor a serious injury.\r\n\r\n\"Forward,\" shouted the chief, pulling his lantern out from under his\r\ncoat. \"Drive this yere swell below!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the band, having reached the deck almost as soon as their\r\nleader, rushed upon the guard, who, after trying in vain to defend\r\nhimself, threw down his gun and retreated into the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Foller him up, lads! Foller him up!\" shouted the chief, flourishing\r\nhis spear in the air. \"Cap'n, you an' Friday an' Jack Spaniard look out\r\nfor that galley!\"\r\n\r\nBy thus dividing his force, Sam had got the students completely\r\nsurrounded. The chief and his squad followed the sentinel down the\r\ncompanion ladder, while the captain and his men rushed into the galley,\r\nand thence into the forecastle, where they surprised four students,\r\nasleep in the bunks, and a corporal, nodding in his chair. The noise\r\nmade by the attacking party, and the bright light that flashed in their\r\nfaces, when Tom turned up the lamp that hung suspended from the beams\r\noverhead, aroused the guard, who, upon beholding the intruders, reached\r\nrather hurriedly for their muskets. But they were in the possession\r\nof Friday and Jack Spaniard, who pointed the bayonets at them, and in\r\nsavage tones demanded their surrender.\r\n\r\n\"Tom Newcombe, is that you?\" exclaimed the corporal, rubbing his eyes,\r\nand taking a second look at the captain.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, it's I,\" replied Tom, who, excited as he was, could not forget\r\nhis usual drawl. \"You asked me why I didn't carry out my idea last\r\nnight. I am carrying it out now. Get up, and go into the hold. You are\r\nall prisoners!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I call this a pretty good joke!\" exclaimed another, raising\r\nup in his bunk, and looking first at Tom, and then at his ragged\r\nfollowers. \"How did you get by the sentinel on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we captured him, that's the way we got by him! And I think you'll\r\nfind it's no joke, either, before we are done with you. Get up, and do\r\nas I tell you!\" he added, sharply, as he heard the students pouring\r\ninto the hold from the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe guard had no alternative but to obey. They crawled slowly out of\r\ntheir bunks, and one of them asked, as he gathered up his clothing, and\r\nnodded his head toward Friday and Jack Spaniard--\r\n\r\n\"Are these gentlemen members of your new society, Newcombe? You must be\r\nrunning with a delightful crowd, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go in there, and don't stop to talk!\" repeated Tom, stamping his foot\r\nand pointing to the door that led from the galley. The students obeyed\r\nwithout any further remarks, and as soon as they had disappeared in the\r\nhold, the door was closed and fastened.\r\n\r\nTom was captain of the Storm King at last!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCRUSOE AFLOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo thought Tom Newcombe, as he held the door that opened from the\r\ngalley into the hold, while Friday locked and further secured it, by\r\nbracing two of the captured muskets against it. Hardly had this been\r\ndone, when the noise of a furious struggle came from the cabin, mingled\r\nwith shouts and yells; and, at the same time, some one in the hold\r\nthrew himself against the door, and tried to burst it open.\r\n\r\n\"Stand firm, men!\" exclaimed a voice, which Tom knew belonged to Harry\r\nGreen. \"Remember the motto, on our flag, and 'Don't give up the ship!'\"\r\n\r\nThen came the governor's battle-cry: \"Down with the 'cademy swells!\r\nDrive 'em in the hold, an' shut 'em up!\"\r\n\r\nTom waited to hear no more. The chief was in trouble, and perhaps\r\nneeded assistance. He sprang up the ladder that led to the deck, and\r\nrushed to the companion-way, just in time to see the governor and his\r\nband falling back before a crowd of students, who poured out of the\r\nhold like bees from a hive. The first-lieutenant of the yacht led the\r\nway, flourishing a piece of a chair, with which he defended himself\r\nfrom the savage thrusts Sam aimed at him with his spear. Close behind\r\nhim came a tall, active student, armed with a pillow, which he used\r\nwith considerable effect; for, just as Tom reached the top of the\r\ncompanion-ladder, where he could look down into the cabin, he saw Xury\r\nknocked head overheels by a blow from this novel weapon. Immediately\r\nafterward another of the students disabled Will Atkins by throwing a\r\nquilt over his head, which he had snatched from a bunk in one of the\r\nstate-rooms. The muskets of the guard were stacked in the after end of\r\nthe cabin, and Tom saw that the students were fighting their way toward\r\nthem. If they succeeded in reaching them, the battle would be speedily\r\nended, and Harry would be able to fulfill his threat of taking Tom and\r\nhis band to the academy, as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Harry Green, as he saw two of the attacking party\r\nstretched on the floor of the cabin. \"Surrender, Sam Barton! Drop that\r\noar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Surrender yourself!\" shouted Friday and Jack Spaniard, springing down\r\nthe ladder and placing themselves beside the chief.\r\n\r\nBy a dexterous movement with his boat-hook, Friday succeeded in\r\ndisarming the first-lieutenant; and Atkins and Xury, having recovered\r\ntheir feet, each seized a musket and renewed the battle. Tom, thinking\r\nthat he could assist the governor without fighting for him, stood at\r\nthe foot of the companion-ladder, and called lustily for help from some\r\nimaginary followers.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the rest of the men in out of the boat!\" he shouted, looking up\r\ninto the darkness, as if he was addressing some one on deck; \"and go\r\nand tell those fellows in the galley to come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with the 'cademy swells!\" shouted the chief again, encouraged by\r\nthe arrival of his reënforcements. \"Drive 'em back! Punch 'em in the\r\nribs!\"\r\n\r\nIf the students had been on equal terms with their assailants, all\r\nthe shouting Sam could have done would not have decided the battle\r\nin his favor. The boys composing the guard belonged to the Storm\r\nKing, and among them were several officers--lieutenants, masters, and\r\nmidshipmen--who would willingly have borne almost any amount of bodily\r\nsuffering rather than surrender the yacht. Like all \"old sailors,\"\r\nthey had become strongly attached to their vessel, and they defended\r\nher with as much resolution as they would have exhibited had she been\r\na human being, capable of appreciating their affection. Besides, their\r\nreputation as officers and seamen were at stake. The result of this\r\nnight's work would be brought up at the next examination, either for\r\nor against them; and, if they lost the vessel, it would be regarded\r\nas evidence that they were not worthy of being trusted, and rival\r\nstudents would have occasion for rejoicing. More than that, although\r\nthey were at a loss to imagine what object Tom had in view in seizing\r\nthe yacht--for they were certain that he was the prime mover in the\r\naffair--they knew that it was his intention to take her to sea; a\r\nproceeding that would not only endanger their vessel, but the life\r\nof every boy on board of her. The officers of the Storm King had been\r\nappointed after a rigid examination, and, consequently, they were the\r\nbest sailors at the academy. They were all worthy of the positions\r\nthey held, but it is doubtful if even the promise of promotion would\r\nhave induced the bravest of them to take the yacht to sea in the face\r\nof the tempest that was then raging. But, with all these motives to\r\nanimate them, the students could not fight unarmed against the weapons\r\nof the Crusoe band. They experienced the same feelings that soldiers\r\nexperience in actual warfare; and, indeed, that was not surprising, for\r\nthe affair in the cabin was a real battle. Crusoe and his men fought\r\nwith the utmost fury--even including Tom Newcombe, who, after calling\r\nupon his imaginary companion on deck, to send down more help, sprang to\r\nthe side of the chief, and assisted in driving the students back from\r\ntheir muskets, which were almost within reach. He also imagined that\r\nhe was fighting for his reputation. If the attack failed, he would be\r\nforever disgraced. He would be taken to the academy as a prisoner, it\r\nwould become known throughout the village that he was the companion and\r\nassociate of young robbers, and then, what would become of him? What\r\nwould his father say about it? With Sam, the case was different. He\r\nfeared no disgrace, but he did fear Mr. Grimes, the police magistrate,\r\nand the jail. His case was desperate; and it was no wonder that he\r\nfought like a young tiger.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, lads?\" exclaimed the chief, as the students fell back,\r\nwhen they saw the reënforcements coming down the ladder, and heard Tom\r\ncalling for more men. \"Down with the 'cademy swells!\"\r\n\r\nThe attack was too furious to be successfully resisted. The students\r\nretreated in confusion, and when the last one had been driven into the\r\nhold, the door was closed and fastened.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, lads!\" exclaimed the governor, leaning on his spear, and\r\nsurveying the battle-field, and the valiant warriors who surrounded\r\nhim. \"We said we'd do it, an' we've kept our promise. Cap'n, I turn the\r\nvessel over to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Newcombe!\" shouted the first-lieutenant of the Storm King, from\r\nhis prison, \"I want to ask you a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ask away,\" drawled the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I want to know if you are commander of the yacht now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" answered Tom, with becoming dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to take her to sea to-night?\"\r\n\r\nTom replied that he was.\r\n\r\n\"It is all up with us, boys,\" said Harry, turning to his fellow\r\nprisoners. \"If Newcombe ever gets the yacht outside the harbor, we're\r\nbooked for Davy's Locker, sure. How does he suppose he can manage a\r\nvessel like this in a storm, when he can scarcely handle a little\r\nsail-boat in calm weather?\"\r\n\r\n\"All hands on deck!\" commanded Tom, who did not hear what Harry said.\r\n\"Bear a hand, and get the outfit aboard! Jump down into the yawl, a\r\ncouple of you, and pass up those boxes! Xury, see that they are stowed\r\naway in the cabin and galley!\"\r\n\r\nThe chief and one of his men sprang into the boat, and the first thing\r\nthey handed up to their companions on deck was the fisher-boy, who had\r\nlain under the thwarts during the fight, heartily wishing that Sam and\r\nhis band might be defeated, so that he would be released. His situation\r\nwas a trying one indeed. To be obliged to remain bound hand and foot,\r\nwhile an ignorant, unskillful young captain was taking him out to sea,\r\nwould have tried stronger nerves than his. While the governor and his\r\nmen were lifting him to the deck--an operation of some difficulty,\r\nowing to the constant rocking of the vessel--he renewed his entreaties\r\nthat they would release his hands and feet, and he even went so far as\r\nto promise that, if allowed the freedom of the deck, he would not make\r\nthe least attempt at escape. But the chief would not listen. He was\r\nafraid of his prisoner, and he believed that the only way to prevent\r\nhim from doing mischief was to keep him securely bound. Friday and Jack\r\nSpaniard carried him into the cabin, and laid him on the sofa, after\r\nwhich they returned to the deck to assist in stowing away the outfit.\r\nWhen the last box had been safely housed in the galley, the chief\r\nsprang over the rail, cast off the painter, and gave his fine yawl up\r\nto the mercy of the waves. \"Now cap'n,\" said he; \"we're all ready.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time since receiving his appointment as master of the\r\nvessel, Tom realized that he had something of a task before him. To\r\nbegin with, he had at least a mile of harbor to traverse before he\r\nreached the bay. The harbor was very crooked, and, in some places,\r\ntoo narrow to admit of much maneuvering; and, even in the day-time,\r\nwith a fair wind, it would have required the exercise of all his skill\r\nand judgment to take his vessel through the shipping that lay at the\r\nwharves without some accident. One reason why he had declined to assume\r\ncharge of the yacht during the trial trip, was because he was afraid he\r\ncould not take her safely into the bay, and he would not have thought\r\nof attempting it now had he been in his sober senses. The night was so\r\ndark that he could not see the shore, except when an occasional flash\r\nof lightning revealed it to him; and the wind was blowing directly up\r\nthe harbor, raising a sea that, even in that sheltered position, made\r\nit difficult for the captain to keep his feet without holding fast to\r\nsomething. Tom shuddered when he thought of what they would experience\r\nif they succeeded in reaching the bay, where the wind could have a fair\r\nsweep at them.\r\n\r\n\"Come, skipper!\" said the governor, seeing that Tom did not issue any\r\norders; \"are you afraid to try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no!\" replied the captain, arousing himself, and pulling the collar\r\nof his pea-jacket up around his ears, \"I was just thinking what was\r\nbest to be done. Xury, look around and find a tow-line. Governor, take\r\ntwo men and get into your yawl; pull around under the bow, and stand by\r\nto take the tow-line.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that fur?\" demanded the chief.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we've got to tow the ship out of the harbor, haven't we?\" drawled\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you'll find the yawl fur me, I'll do it. I let her go as soon\r\nas we got the things out, an' there's no tellin' where she is by this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, what made you do that?\" exclaimed the captain. \"Who ordered\r\nyou to turn her adrift?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to use her? A nice skipper\r\nyou'll make, if you don't look out fur things better than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's a tow-line, cap'n,\" said Xury.\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir!\" replied Tom. \"All hands lay aft to lower the cutter.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this order, the crew moved aft, where a very small\r\nboat, that Tom had dignified with the name of cutter, hung at the stern\r\ndavits. She was scarcely large enough to accommodate three men, and the\r\ngovernor, after he had examined her by the aid of the lantern, which he\r\ncarried under his coat, through fear of attracting the attention of the\r\nwatch on some of the neighboring vessels, shook his head and stepped\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Man the falls,\" commanded Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Now, jest look a here, cap'n,\" said Sam, \"if you want a crew to man\r\nthat ar egg-shell, you'd best call for volunteers. You don't ketch\r\nGovernor Barton in no such craft in a night like this. Why, she'd be\r\nswamped the minute she touched the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, how am I to get the ship out to sea, I'd like to know?\"\r\ndrawled Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That's your look out, an' not mine,\" replied Sam, as he turned on his\r\nheel and walked forward, followed by the rest of the crew. \"I aint\r\nmaster of this vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It don't look as if I was master of her, either,\" answered Tom, almost\r\nready to cry with vexation. \"What's the use of having any captain, if\r\nno one will obey his commands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you give sensible orders, then, like a man had oughter do?\r\nWe aint a goin' to get into that ar little boat, an' that's jest all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nTom did not know what to do. It looked as though the expedition was\r\nto end then and there. What was the use of being captain, if his crew\r\nwere to be the judges as to whether or not an order ought to be obeyed?\r\nHow he wished that he possessed the physical power of the second mate\r\nof the Savannah! Wouldn't he enforce obedience? Perhaps all that was\r\nneeded was a show of authority and resolution.\r\n\r\n\"Now look here, men,\" exclaimed the captain, in a voice which he\r\nintended should strike terror to the hearts of every one of the band,\r\n\"I am not going to stand any such nonsense. I am the lawful master of\r\nthis vessel, and I'll make you sup sorrow with a big spoon if you don't\r\nobey orders. Lay aft, now, to lower away the cutter. Mr. Mate, use a\r\nrope's end on the first man who dares hesitate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'd like to see Mr. Mate try that on,\" exclaimed the governor,\r\nfiercely. \"Tommy, if you know when you are well off, you won't give no\r\nmore such orders as that ar. You aint lord an' master of the whole of\r\nus, if you do command the Storm King. But you aint cap'n no longer. You\r\ncan jest take your old name agin; fur I won't serve under no feller who\r\ntalks of usin' a rope's end on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, do you suppose I am going to stand that?\" whined Tom. \"I won't\r\nserve as a sailor. I am the best navigator and seaman in the band, the\r\nonly one who knows any thing about the winds and currents, and if I\r\nstay on board this vessel I am going to command her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Muley,\" said the governor, \"you haven't yet larnt that I am the\r\nhead man in this society, an' if you don't look out, I'll have to give\r\nyou a few lessons like I did Will Atkins. You're a foremast hand now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't be one long,\" said Tom, who now, being convinced that\r\nhe could not rule the expedition, had suddenly determined to ruin it.\r\n\"I've got an idea.\"\r\n\r\nIf the governor had understood the meaning of this declaration, he\r\nwould have paid some attention to it. As he was not yet well acquainted\r\nwith Tom, he did not think it necessary to reply to him, for he turned\r\nto his crew, and ordered them to assist him in hoisting the sails.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, you are not going to try to sail out in the teeth of this\r\nstorm,\" exclaimed Tom, who, ignorant as he was, knew that their chances\r\nfor reaching the bay were very slim indeed. \"You'll sink the yacht\r\nbefore you've gone twenty yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough out of you, Muley,\" returned the new captain, as he and\r\nthe crew busied themselves in clearing away the mainsail. \"I am master\r\nof this vessel now, an' if you don't move when you're spoken to, I'll\r\nmake _you_ sup sorrow with a wooden ladle, an' that's bigger'n a spoon.\r\nLend a hand here!\"\r\n\r\nTom obeyed this order very reluctantly. All his bright hopes had\r\ndisappeared, like snow before an April shower. The edict of the chief,\r\nreducing him to the ranks, destroyed all the interest he had ever felt\r\nin the Crusoe band. He no longer desired the success of the expedition;\r\non the contrary, he resolved to defeat it if possible. He would watch\r\nhis opportunity, and, when he could do so without being discovered, he\r\nwould slip down into the cabin and liberate all the prisoners. They\r\ncould arm themselves with their muskets, which the governor had very\r\ncarelessly left scattered about the cabin, and while Crusoe and his\r\nmen were occupied in navigating the vessel, they could surprise and\r\noverpower them. This was his new idea. By the time he had thought it\r\nover, the mainsail had been close reefed, and was ready for hoisting.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" shouted the governor, \"stand by--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" exclaimed Xury. \"Mebbe she won't handle well without a head\r\nsail. You had oughter hist one of them jibs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the chief. \"It aint best to put up too much canvas\r\nin this breeze. We've got a long voyage to make, an' we must be careful\r\nof our vessel. Muley, you ketch hold of the peak halyard, an' the rest\r\nof us man the throat-halyard. All ready, now! Hist away.\"\r\n\r\nAs this order was obeyed, the yacht began to plunge and careen worse\r\nthan ever; and presently, a flash of lightning showed Tom that they\r\nwere drifting up the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Sam!\" he almost gasped, \"she's dragging the anchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hist away, lively,\" exclaimed the chief, in desperation. \"If you've\r\ngot any muscle at all, show it now;\" and catching up his lantern,\r\nhe ran forward, intending to slip the chain. But he was saved that\r\ntrouble. The cable, which had not been intended to hold the yacht in a\r\ngale of wind, with her mainsail set, parted with a loud snap, and for\r\na moment the little vessel was at the mercy of the storm. The greatest\r\nexcitement prevailed among the crew. The lightning flashed again, and\r\nSam held his breath in dismay when he saw that the Storm King was being\r\ndriven rapidly toward the shore. It was a capital opportunity for him\r\nto make an exhibition of his seamanship, but he had not the slightest\r\nidea of what ought to be done; neither had Tom Newcombe, who stood\r\nholding fast to the peak-halyard, his mouth open, and his tongue\r\nparalyzed with terror. Fortunately for the Crusoe band, for the vessel,\r\nand for the comfort of the prisoners below, there was one boy on board\r\nwho kept his wits about him, and that was Xury.\r\n\r\n\"Belay all!\" he shouted, springing to the wheel. \"Stand by the\r\nmain-sheet! Haul in, fur your lives.\"\r\n\r\nXury put the helm hard-a-starboard, the boom flew over with a jerk,\r\nprostrating two of the crew who were careless enough to put themselves\r\nin its way, and the next moment the yacht was thrown almost on her beam\r\nends. But Xury was equal to the emergency. He handled the wheel with a\r\ngreat deal of skill, and proved himself to be worthy of the position\r\nhe held. He \"eased her up\" without a moment's delay; the Storm King\r\nrighted, and the next flash of lightning showed the crew that she was\r\nscudding across the harbor at a terrific rate of speed.\r\n\r\n\"Bully for you, Xury!\" shouted the governor, who never once thought of\r\nthe danger they might be in. \"We're all right now. From this time on,\r\nyou are my first-lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put a look-out on the forecastle, governor,\" exclaimed Xury, yelling\r\nwith all the strength of his lungs, in order to make himself heard\r\nabove the howling of the wind, \"I can't see a foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerusalem!\" shouted Will Atkins, suddenly. \"Look out, Xury!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!\" came the hail, in startled tones, through the darkness.\r\n\"Keep away! Don't run into me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind your own business!\" shouted Friday, in reply. \"This ship has got\r\nher own officers on board.\"\r\n\r\nXury had been warned just in time to avoid running into a vessel lying\r\nat the wharf. He put the helm to port, but the yacht, being without a\r\nhead-sail, obeyed very slowly. By the light of a lantern, which the\r\ngovernor held over the side, the Crusoe band discovered that they were\r\nrushing by the side of a large ship, and so close to her that they\r\ncould almost touch her. But Xury understood his business, and in a\r\nmoment more that danger was passed, and the Storm King was scudding\r\ntoward the other side of the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I can't stand this,\" drawled Tom Newcombe, who was utterly\r\nconfounded by the recklessness displayed by the Crusoe band. He stood\r\nholding fast to the rail, and, had it been daylight, the governor would\r\nhave seen that his face was deadly pale, and that he was trembling in\r\nevery limb, as if he had been seized with a fit of the ague. The wind\r\nhad carried his cap overboard, but he was so completely engrossed in\r\nthinking over the dangers of his situation that he did not notice that\r\nhe was bare-headed, and that the rain was running down his back in\r\nlittle streams. \"O, I know that I shall go to the bottom in less than\r\nfive minutes!\" cried Tom, involuntarily catching his breath, as the\r\nStorm King careened wildly under a fierce gust of wind. \"Then what will\r\nbecome of those fellows below deck? I am going to start for the cabin,\r\nand, if I live to get there, I'll let them all out. I know Harry Green\r\ncan manage the vessel.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom spoke, he let go of the rail and staggered toward the\r\ncompanion-way. Just as he placed his foot upon the first step of the\r\nladder, he lost his balance, and pitched headlong into the cabin. He\r\nwas much more frightened than hurt by the fall, for he firmly believed\r\nthat the yacht had capsized, and that, in an instant more, he would\r\nfind the cabin flooded with water. But nothing of the sort happened.\r\nThe reckless Xury still kept the Storm King well under control,\r\nand, thus far, by some unaccountable fortune, he had succeeded in\r\nkeeping her clear of the vessels at the wharves. Tom clung to the\r\ncompanion-ladder a moment or two, to make sure that the yacht was\r\nstill right side up, and that his absence from the deck had not been\r\ndiscovered, and then prepared to carry out his new idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE TABLES TURNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the fisher-boy lay upon the sofa in the cabin, where Friday\r\nand Jack Spaniard had left him, listening to the noise of the storm,\r\nand wondering how many chances there were in a thousand that he would\r\never return to Newport. Again and again had he made the most desperate\r\nbut unsuccessful efforts to free himself from his bonds, and finally,\r\nbecoming wearied with his exertions, and discouraged by his failures,\r\nhe settled back on the sofa, and awaited the destruction of the vessel\r\nwith all the fortitude he could command.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he heard the students moving about in their prison, and\r\nnow and then the door would shake and bend, as if the boys were trying\r\nto force it from its hinges. Bob watched and listened, hoping that\r\nthey would discover some way of effecting their escape; but the door,\r\nlike every thing else about the yacht, had been made at Mr. Graves'\r\nship-yard, and it was \"first-class.\" It resisted all their efforts, and\r\nat last, the students, like Bob, became discouraged, and sat down to\r\ntalk the matter over.\r\n\r\nHarry Green was in great trouble. At his own request he had been\r\nplaced in command of the guard of the yacht, and now, scarcely more\r\nthan three hours after he assumed charge of the vessel, she had been\r\ntaken from him. Since he had worked out the punishment that had been\r\ninflicted upon him for taking part in Tom's runaway scheme, he had been\r\none of the most diligent students at the academy. He was working with\r\nan object in view, and that was, to distance the lieutenant-colonel\r\nat the next examination. As far as his lessons were concerned, he was\r\nalready ahead of him in every thing except navigation; and he had\r\nresolved, that, by the end of the next quarter, he would lead his class\r\nin that study also. But his knowledge of books was not the only thing\r\nthat would be inquired into. His conduct as an officer--as captain of\r\ncompany A, and first lieutenant of the Storm King, would be severely\r\ncriticised, and especially the manner in which he executed the orders\r\nof his superiors. In his military record, Harry was confident that\r\nhe could show a clean score; but there was every prospect that his\r\ncareer as a naval lieutenant would be brought to a speedy termination.\r\nColonel Steele, in his capacity as a ranking naval officer, had given\r\nhim written instructions to hold the yacht at all hazards in case\r\nan assault should be made upon her, and to bring every one of the\r\nattacking party prisoners to the academy. Harry had failed to obey\r\nthese orders, and he was a candidate for a court-martial. The other\r\nofficers of the guard were in the same predicament, and so were the\r\nseamen. They all had rivals at the academy, who were working hard to\r\nremove them from their positions on board the yacht, and it was no\r\nwonder that they looked upon the result of the battle as the greatest\r\ncalamity that could have befallen them. They had lost their vessel,\r\nand, although there was not one among them who believed that they could\r\nbe blamed for that, they felt rather serious, when they reflected that\r\nthey would be called upon to prove this to the colonel's satisfaction.\r\nCould they not wipe out the disgrace, and insure their acquittal before\r\nthe court-martial, by turning the tables on their enemies? The first\r\nlieutenant thought they could, but he did not know how to do it. He\r\ngroped his way to the door--for the hold was so dark that he could\r\nnot see his hand before him--threw himself against it with all his\r\nstrength, and then called some of his crew to his assistance; but it\r\nwas all in vain. They were prisoners, and such they would probably\r\nremain until their captors saw fit to release them.\r\n\r\n\"What in the name of sense do you suppose Tom Newcombe intends to do\r\nwith us, and with the yacht?\" was a question that the first lieutenant\r\nhad asked perhaps twenty times, and which none of the crew could\r\nanswer. They knew that Tom was very angry because his father had\r\npresented the Storm King to the principal of the academy, instead of\r\ngiving it to him, and they were also well aware that that was one\r\nreason why he had seized the vessel. But they had never heard a word\r\nabout the Crusoe band, and, consequently, they could not imagine where\r\nTom was going, or why he kept company with Sam Barton and his band of\r\noutlaws. This matter had been talked over until every boy in the crew\r\nhad expressed an opinion; and the only conclusion at which they arrived\r\nwas, that Tom had got another of his wild ideas into his head, and that\r\nhe would be certain, sooner or later, to get them and every body else\r\non board the yacht into serious trouble.\r\n\r\n\"I have been with Newcombe on one runaway expedition,\" said Harry, \"and\r\nI shall regret it as long as I live. I don't want to go with him on\r\nanother, especially if he is to command the vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said one of the midshipmen--another old Night-hawk.\r\n\"But how shall we get away from him? that's the question! If we could\r\nonly take him and all the members of his society to the academy as\r\nprisoners, wouldn't it be----I'll tell you what it is, fellows,\" he\r\nadded, as the sloop gave a tremendous lurch, which threw all the\r\nstudents into a heap in one corner of the hold, \"if we don't get on\r\ndeck very soon, and take charge of this craft, she's bound to go to the\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild plunging of the vessel, the noise of the waves washing against\r\nher sides, and the sound of hurrying feet on the deck overhead, sent a\r\nthrill of terror to the heart of every boy in the hold. They knew that\r\ntheir captors had succeeded in getting the yacht under way, but they\r\ndid not fully realize their danger until one of the students, who was\r\nsteadying himself by holding on to the mast, which ran up through the\r\nhold, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Fellows, Newcombe has hoisted some of the canvas, and is trying to\r\nsail out of the harbor in the face of this gale. Just put your hands on\r\nthe mast, and see how it quivers!\"\r\n\r\nAs if they were acting under orders, the crew made a rush for the after\r\nend of the hold, and commenced another furious attack upon the door,\r\nbut with no other effect than to increase their alarm. There was no\r\npossible chance for escape. Both doors were securely fastened, the\r\nhatch overhead was battened down, and when the yacht was capsized or\r\nsunk--an event which they all believed to be not far distant--nothing\r\non earth could save them.\r\n\r\n\"Fellows--\" began the first lieutenant.\r\n\r\nWhat he was about to say the boys never knew, for he was interrupted in\r\nhis speech by a shout from one of the crew, who had been crawling about\r\nthe hold on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for me!\" shouted the student. \"Where's the lieutenant? I have\r\nbeen lucky enough to find a handspike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass it over here!\" said Harry, in an excited voice. \"Stand by, now,\r\nand the moment I burst the door open, make a rush, and don't stop until\r\nthe vessel is ours. We must take charge of the yacht before Newcombe\r\ngets her into the bay, and we've no time to lose. Keep still, fellows!\r\nSomebody is outside the door!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys held their breath in suspense, and crouched, like so many\r\ntigers, ready for a spring. Some one was certainly busy with the lock.\r\nAfter a delay that seemed an age to the students, the key turned, the\r\ndoor opened, and the next moment Tom Newcombe was knocked clear across\r\nthe cabin, by a blow from the pillow, in the hands of the tall student,\r\nwho was the first to spring into the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"That was a lucky haul, fellows!\" exclaimed the first lieutenant.\r\n\"We've got the old boy himself. Secure him at once.\"\r\n\r\nHarry, of course, did not know that Tom had released him and his crew\r\nintentionally, and perhaps it would have made no difference to him\r\nif he had. Like all the rest of the students, he looked upon Tom as\r\na very dangerous fellow, and he was resolved to capture him, even if\r\nby so doing the other members of the band were allowed an opportunity\r\nto escape. In obedience to the order, half a dozen students threw\r\nthemselves upon him, and Tom, stunned by the blow from the pillow, and\r\nastonished at the roughness with which he was handled, did not fairly\r\nrecover the use of his tongue until he found himself securely bound\r\nand confined in one of the state-rooms--the apartment that had been\r\nintended for the captain of the vessel, and which he had expected to\r\noccupy under very different circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy lay upon the sofa a delighted witness of all that took\r\nplace; but, although the lamp was burning brightly, and he was in\r\nplain sight, the students were so excited, and so fully occupied in\r\nsecuring possession of their weapons, and disposing of their prisoner,\r\nthat they were not aware of his presence until he aroused them by\r\nsaying--\"Now, perhaps you will be kind enough to release me!\"\r\n\r\nOf course the students were kind enough to do it, and they did do it as\r\nsoon as they had satisfied themselves that he was not a member of Tom's\r\nband. He was not required to enter into any lengthy explanation, for\r\nthe first lieutenant was in a great hurry to finish the work so well\r\nbegun; and, besides, the fact that the fisher-boy was bound hand and\r\nfoot, was sufficient evidence that he had not assisted in the capture\r\nof the vessel, and that he had been brought there against his will.\r\n\r\n\"No time to talk, fellows,\" said the first lieutenant. \"How many of\r\nthem are there, Jennings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only five, now that Tom is a prisoner,\" replied Bob, picking up the\r\nspear that the governor had used during the fight, and making some\r\nfeeble attempts to stand on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Only five!\" repeated Harry, in astonishment. \"Eighteen fellows whipped\r\nin a fair fight by one-third of their number! Boys, I think this will\r\nbe our first and last cruise in the Storm King. That is bad evidence to\r\nbe brought up against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it wasn't a fair fight,\" said one of the crew. \"They were armed\r\nand we were not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they whipped us, anyhow,\" said the lieutenant, \"and now we must\r\nwhip them. Stand by to board with a loud cheer! Board!\"\r\n\r\nThe students, yelling at the top of their lungs, sprang up the ladder,\r\nand gained the deck without meeting any of the enemy. The members of\r\nthe Crusoe band were so fully occupied in navigating the vessel, that\r\nthey had not noticed Tom's absence from the deck, and the noise of the\r\nstorm had drowned all sounds of what had been going on in the cabin.\r\n\r\nWhen the first lieutenant reached the top of the ladder, he stopped,\r\nappalled by the scene presented to his gaze. The storm was increasing\r\nin fury every moment, the lightning flashed almost incessantly,\r\nrendering objects about the harbor as plainly visible as if it had\r\nbeen daylight, and the wind howled as fiercely as ever. By some streak\r\nof luck which the lieutenant could not understand, and which would\r\nnot have attended him again had he attempted the same feat, Xury had\r\nsucceeded in piloting the vessel safely through the harbor; and when\r\nthe students reached the deck, she was on the point of entering the bay.\r\n\r\nHarry had witnessed many a tempest, both at sea and on shore, and as\r\nhe began to regard himself as quite an accomplished sailor, he was\r\ndisposed to make light of storms that were really terrific. But he had\r\nnothing to say about this one. He had never seen such waves in Newport\r\nBay, neither had he ever seen a vessel so badly handled as was the\r\nStorm King. The mainsail, close reefed, was the only canvas hoisted,\r\nbut that was altogether too much for her; besides, Xury was becoming\r\nfrightened, and managed the wheel with very unsteady hands. Sometimes\r\nthe sail would feel the full force of the gale, and the yacht would\r\nroll down almost to her beam ends; then Xury would \"luff\" until the\r\nsail was shaking in the wind, when he would fill away again. Harry took\r\nthis all in at a glance. He dared not hesitate long, for he saw the\r\nnecessity of prompt action.\r\n\r\n\"Richardson!\" he shouted, turning to one of the midshipmen, \"take two\r\nmen to the wheel, and put her about at once. Forward! and clear the\r\ndeck of these pirates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, here!\" exclaimed the governor, who just then happened to glance\r\ntoward the companion-way. \"Here they are, fellers! Down with the\r\n'cademy swells!\"\r\n\r\nBut the chief's battle-cry failed to produce any effect upon his\r\ncrew. The lightning showed them that the students had recovered their\r\nweapons, and that was enough to convince them that their voyage was\r\nat an end. Besides, they were not allowed time to make up their minds\r\nwhether to fight or surrender, for the students, led by Harry, rushed\r\nforward in a body, and in a moment every member of the Crusoe band,\r\nexcept the governor, was a prisoner. The latter caught up a hand-spike,\r\nand stood his ground long enough to see his men overpowered, one after\r\nthe other, when he dropped his weapon and sprang upon the bowsprit,\r\nwhere he was followed by half a dozen of the students.\r\n\r\n\"Surrender, Sam Barton!\" exclaimed the foremost. \"Your cruise is up,\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much, I won't surrender,\" replied the chief, desperate to the\r\nlast. \"Better not come too near me!\"\r\n\r\nThe students, not in the least intimidated by this last remark, which\r\nimplied that he intended to resist all their efforts to capture him,\r\ncontinued to follow the chief, who, having retreated as far as he could\r\ntoward the end of the bowsprit, suddenly arose to his feet. \"Down with\r\nthe 'cademy swells!\" he shouted, shaking his fist at his pursuers.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he stood with his arms spread out, balancing himself\r\non the bowsprit, and then, with another wild cry, he sprang into the\r\nair and disappeared under the bow of the yacht, which, by this time,\r\nhad been put about, and was booming along up the harbor at a terrific\r\nrate. A cry of horror arose from all who had witnessed this last act\r\nof the chief, and while one hurried off to report the matter to the\r\nlieutenant, the others ran aft to watch for him as he arose under the\r\nstern. But not one of those students ever saw Sam Barton again. By\r\nthe time they reached the stern, the yacht had left the spot where he\r\ndisappeared a long way behind, and they were as powerless to assist\r\nhim as if he had been in mid-ocean. The chief, in his desperation,\r\npreferred to trust himself to the waves, rather than in the hands of\r\nthe students; and, whatever other dangers he might have run into, he\r\nwas safe from the clutches of Mr. Grimes. But this incident, exciting\r\nas it was, was soon forgotten. The students had other things to think\r\nof, and the governor's reckless courage ceased to be the topic of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe first lieutenant had his hands full. He was filled with\r\napprehension and trembling with anxiety for the safety of his vessel\r\nand crew, but he did not forget his prisoners, who, being taken in\r\ncharge by a guard detailed for that purpose, were marched down into the\r\nhold and locked up.\r\n\r\nThe sail up the harbor was attended with quite as much, if not more,\r\ndanger than the coming down had been. The first lieutenant had too\r\nmuch at stake to run any risks, and as soon as the crew could be got\r\ntogether--for, in the excitement attending the battle, and the escape\r\nfrom the hold, all discipline had been forgotten--he ordered the sail\r\ntaken in. This was speedily accomplished, and then the yacht drifted\r\nhelplessly about on the waves. But her speed, of course, was greatly\r\ndiminished, and the danger attending a collision, if one occurred, was\r\ndiminished in the same proportion. Harry's next care was, to send one\r\nof the midshipmen to get the spare anchor up from the hold. This was\r\nan operation of some difficulty. The anchor was weighty, and the first\r\nlieutenant was the only one on board who understood the management of\r\nheavy bodies, and he could not leave the deck. Only a part of the crew\r\nengaged in executing this order. The others were kept on deck, holding\r\nthemselves in readiness to \"fend off,\" if there should be danger of\r\nrunning into any of the vessels at the wharves. The yacht drifted\r\nalong, sometimes stern foremost, sometimes sideways, but generally\r\nkeeping near the middle of the harbor, and, by the time the midshipman\r\ncame aft, to report the anchor ready, they were within a short distance\r\nof the place from which they started on their involuntary cruise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHARRY'S REPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed the first lieutenant, drawing a long breath of\r\nrelief, as the yacht swung round with her head to the storm, after the\r\nanchor had been let go, \"we're back here, and in just as good condition\r\nas when we started, if we except very wet skins and badly damaged\r\nreputations. But the vessel is all right, and that's one thing I can\r\nfeel easy about.\"\r\n\r\nHarry left the officer who was second in command of the guard, to make\r\nevery thing snug on board, and went below to talk to Tom Newcombe; for,\r\nthus far, he had not heard a word uttered that gave him an insight\r\ninto his object in capturing the vessel. As he descended into the\r\ncabin he met the fisher-boy, who, since his release, had made several\r\nunsuccessful attempts to reach the deck to assist the students in\r\nretaking the yacht. But he had not yet fully recovered the use of his\r\nhands and feet, and, he had been obliged to remain inactive in the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\"Is she all right, now?\" asked Bob, as the lieutenant came down the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and as sound as a dollar,\" was the reply. \"I shall turn her over\r\nto her next executive officer, in just as good condition as she was\r\nreceived; and that's some consolation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had driven them down here,\" said the fisher-boy, as he\r\nstood his spear up in one corner of the cabin. \"I'd like to have had a\r\nchance at the governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The governor!\" repeated Harry, curiously. \"Do you mean Sam Barton?\r\nHe is overboard. He jumped into the harbor on purpose. I hoped to\r\ncommand this vessel one of these days,\" continued the lieutenant, more\r\ninterested in his own affairs, just then, than in the fate of the\r\nchief, \"but Tom Newcombe has sadly interfered with my arrangements by\r\nthis night's work. Wouldn't it be a good plan to pitch him overboard\r\nalso?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it would,\" answered Bob. \"It might save somebody some\r\ntrouble; for he'll be into another scrape as soon as he gets fairly out\r\nof this one, and he will ruin any body who has any thing to do with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came you here a prisoner?\" inquired the lieutenant. \"You were\r\nnot in the fight, were you?\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy's story was a long one; for, in order to enable Harry\r\nto understand how he came to incur the displeasure of Sam Barton, he\r\nwas obliged to begin with the story of the passenger who had paid him\r\nforty dollars in gold for catching the steamer. He told all about Tom's\r\nlottery scheme, which made the lieutenant laugh until his jaws ached,\r\nand finally, he came to the Crusoe band. He related the circumstances\r\nconnected with his capture; revealed the objects of the organization,\r\nand also the motives that had led Tom Newcombe to become a member, as\r\nfar as he was acquainted with them. What he did not know Harry was able\r\nto supply, and thus they got at a complete history of every thing Tom\r\nhad done since his expulsion from the society of Night-hawks. Harry was\r\nreally amazed to learn that a boy of Tom's years could put any faith in\r\na lottery, and believe that Sam Barton's idea of hunting up an island\r\nsomewhere in the ocean, and leading Crusoe life, could be successfully\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that my chances for promotion are the best in the world\r\njust now,\" said the lieutenant, as he arose and unlocked the door that\r\nled into the hold, \"but such as they are, I would almost give them up\r\nto know what notion that boy will get into his head next. I wonder if\r\nhe won't come to the conclusion that the North Pole is 'just the place\r\nhe always wanted to go to,' and try to fit out an expedition among the\r\nvillage boys!\"\r\n\r\n\"If he does he will get plenty of recruits,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Come out here, Friday, Jack Spaniard, Will Atkins, and Exury,\"\r\nexclaimed Harry, addressing himself to the prisoners. \"Let us have a\r\nlook at you. I want to see the boy who was lucky enough to take this\r\nvessel down the harbor in this storm, without smashing her to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy, while relating the history and exploits of the Crusoe\r\nband, had given the lieutenant the names of the members, just as the\r\ngovernor had pronounced them.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Richardson,\" continued Harry, turning to the midshipman\r\nwho had managed the vessel, while his superior officer was leading the\r\nattack on the pirates, \"I have read Robinson Crusoe a good many times,\r\nbut I never saw any thing in it about a fellow called Exury. Whom are\r\nyou named after?\" he added, addressing the reckless pilot.\r\n\r\n\"After the feller that was with the governor when he ran away in the\r\nboat that had a shoulder of mutton for a sail,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe first lieutenant, who was highly amused at every thing he heard\r\nregarding the band, laughed louder than ever. Xury had got things\r\npretty well mixed up, if he supposed that Crusoe's boat had a shoulder\r\nof mutton for a sail; but, after all, he was not to blame for that, for\r\nhe had never read the book, and all his ideas concerning the hero of\r\nthe band, and his surroundings, were gained from what he had heard Sam\r\nsay on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I know who you are now,\" said Harry, slowly surveying his prisoner\r\nfrom head to foot, \"and I would advise you to discard your real name\r\nand stick to your assumed one. If it will always bring you such luck\r\nas has attended you to-night, you'll be an admiral one of these days.\r\nRichardson, see that these fellows are made comfortable for the night.\r\nThey came very near sending us all to the bottom, but that's no reason\r\nwhy we should not treat them as kindly as we can.\"\r\n\r\nThe midshipman took charge of the prisoners, and Harry unlocked the\r\ndoor of the state-room in which Tom was confined, and went in to talk\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I'd like to know what you are going to do with me!\" drawled\r\nthe prisoner, as the lieutenant untied the ropes with which his hands\r\nand feet were bound. \"I always was the most unlucky boy in the whole\r\nworld, but this is the worst scrape I ever got into.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came in, captain, to tell you that there is a good fire in the\r\ngalley, and that you may go in there and dry your clothing, if you feel\r\nso disposed,\" replied Harry.\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I won't do it,\" whined Tom. \"I'd rather stay here as I am,\r\nthan to go in there and have all those fellows tormenting me. I want\r\nyou to quit calling me captain, for I wasn't master of the vessel, nor\r\ngovernor of the band, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, didn't you tell me that you were commander of the yacht?\"\r\ndemanded Harry.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, I did, but I didn't hold the office long, for the governor got\r\nmad at me, and broke me; and then I got mad at him, and let you out.\r\nBut I wouldn't have done it, if I had known that you would knock me\r\ndown, and then keep me here a prisoner. What are you going to do with\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a question that Harry did not like to answer. Although Tom\r\nhad caused him a great deal of uneasiness, and had placed the yacht\r\nand her crew in jeopardy he was not revengeful, and, if he could have\r\nhad his own way, he would have released his prisoner at once. Bad as\r\nhe was, he was the son of the man who had presented the principal of\r\nthe academy with the fine vessel of which he had the honor to be the\r\nexecutive officer, and for that, if for no other reason, Harry did not\r\nwant to see him disgraced. But his orders were, to bring the attacking\r\nparty to the academy as prisoners of war, and now, that he had captured\r\nthem, he could not disobey.\r\n\r\n\"You are going to put me ashore now, are you not, Harry?\" whined the\r\nprisoner, trying hard to choke back his tears. \"I'll never do it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't!\" replied the lieutenant. \"I am acting under orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must remember that I let you out,\" said Tom. \"I was trying to\r\nmake amends for what I had done. What do you suppose my father will\r\nsay, when he hears that you marched me to the academy with those low,\r\nignorant ferry-boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But if those boys were good enough for you while you\r\nwere at liberty to do as you pleased, they are certainly good enough\r\nfor you now that you are a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I won't stand it, I tell you,\" roared Tom, now beginning to cry in\r\nearnest. \"I am not going to the academy under arrest, to be shut up in\r\nthe guard-house. Now mind what I say, Harry Green! If you don't let me\r\ngo at once, I'll square yards with you some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to stay here to listen to any threats,\" replied the\r\nlieutenant, placing his hand on the door-knob. \"You have been a student\r\nat the academy, and you know what is done with a fellow who does not\r\nobey orders. You had better go into the galley and dry your clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, now, I won't do it,\" shouted Tom, who seemed to be almost beside\r\nhimself with rage.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, if I will allow you the freedom of the vessel, will you\r\npromise that you will not try to escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't do that either. Get out of here! I'll fix you for this!\"\r\n\r\nHarry, seeing that his prisoner was in very bad humor, left the\r\nstate-room, locking the door after him. While he was talking to Tom,\r\nthe crew had been employed in setting things to rights, and now the\r\ncabin presented the same scene of neatness and order that it had before\r\nthe fight--only one of the chairs was missing, and the center-table had\r\nbeen pushed against the bulkhead to enable it to retain its upright\r\nposition, one of its legs having been broken off during the struggle.\r\nThe officer on duty sat at the desk writing, as if nothing had\r\nhappened, and a sentinel had been posted at the door of the hold, who\r\nsaluted the lieutenant as he passed.\r\n\r\nHarry went into the galley, where the crew had congregated to dry their\r\nclothing by the fire, and to listen to the fisher-boy's story. Xury,\r\nJack Spaniard, Friday, and Will Atkins were there, under charge of\r\na guard, and they seemed to take matters very coolly answering all\r\nthe questions asked them, and even putting in a word now and then, to\r\nassist Bob in his description of the incidents that happened while\r\nhe was a prisoner in the cave. Xury, especially, was very talkative.\r\nThe crew all looked at him with a good deal of curiosity, and he\r\nheld himself very stiffly, believing that he had accomplished a most\r\nremarkable feat, when he piloted the vessel safely through the harbor,\r\nand that it was his superior skill as a sailor, and not luck, that had\r\ncarried him through.\r\n\r\nThe students were as much astonished at Bob's story as their officer\r\nhad been; and, after the latter had listened a few moments to their\r\nremarks, he came to the conclusion that, for once in his life, Tom\r\nNewcombe had shown some judgment when he declined to mingle with the\r\ncrew. While some of them regarded the whole affair as a stupendous\r\njoke, others were very angry at him, and all believed that no other boy\r\nof his age in the world had so little common sense. Very likely the\r\nprisoner was much more comfortable in his wet clothes than he would\r\nhave been by the fire, in the galley.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant took off his coat, wrung the water out of it, and\r\nstood by the stove until his clothes were dry, when he returned to\r\nthe cabin, where he found the tall student with his hand wrapped up\r\nin his handkerchief, walking up and down the floor. This was Jackson,\r\nthe second lieutenant of the ship, and the one who had done such good\r\nservice with his pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt much?\" inquired Harry.\r\n\r\n\"It is not very comfortable, I assure you,\" replied the student, his\r\nface all wrinkled up with pain, \"but I don't mind the hurt so much as I\r\ndo the investigation that is coming.\"\r\n\r\nThe first lieutenant seated himself at his desk, to write out his\r\nreport of the incidents of the night. He went about it with as much\r\nearnestness as if he had been the commander of a government vessel, in\r\ntime of war, and had just come out of a terrible fight. He had nothing\r\nto do but to tell the truth in the fewest possible words, and in a few\r\nminutes the report was finished. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"ACADEMY SHIP STORM KING,\r\n  July 16th, 18--.\r\n\r\n  \"_Sir_\r\n\r\n \"It becomes my unpleasant duty to inform you that an attack was made\r\n upon this vessel, at half-past ten o'clock, by an organized band of\r\n outlaws, calling themselves 'Crusoe men,' and that it was partially\r\n successful.\r\n\r\n \"In accordance with the instructions contained in your letters of this\r\n date, I reported to the commanding officer of the yacht for duty and\r\n command of the vessel. I at once proceeded to carry out the verbal\r\n orders given me before I left the academy, and detailed six privates,\r\n two corporals, and as many officers, for guard duty. One sentry was\r\n posted on deck, while the officer remained in the cabin, and the\r\n corporal in the forecastle, the latter going on deck twice each hour,\r\n to strike the bells and see that every thing was snug. At the time\r\n the attack was made, private Simmonds was the sentinel on deck, and\r\n lieutenant Jackson the officer of the guard. The attacking party,\r\n consisting of six men, were led by Samuel Barton, who went by the name\r\n of governor. They boarded the vessel from a yawl--the darkness and the\r\n howling of the storm effectually concealing their movements from the\r\n sentinel, and drowning all sounds of their approach. Private Simmonds\r\n called for the corporal, and attempted to prevent the boarding of\r\n the pirates, but was obliged to retreat into the cabin, where he\r\n was pursued by the governor and a portion of his band; the others,\r\n commanded by Thomas Newcombe, going down into the galley, and thence\r\n into the forecastle, where they aroused the guard from a sound sleep,\r\n and drove them into the hold. The governor's squad numbered only three\r\n men, but they were armed with spears, which we found to be quite as\r\n dangerous as bayonets.\r\n\r\n \"The most of the crew were asleep in the hold, and before they could\r\n be awakened, the officers in the cabin had been overpowered and\r\n crowded into the hold at the point of the spears. The pirates placed\r\n themselves between us and our weapons, but we would have succeeded in\r\n beating them back but for the arrival of their reënforcements. Some\r\n of them turned our own weapons against us, and, being unarmed, we were\r\n forced to retreat. The pirates then locked us up in the hold, after\r\n which, Thomas Newcombe took command of the vessel.\r\n\r\n \"Owing to some disagreement with the chief, he was broken, and the\r\n management of the yacht devolved upon a member of the band, who\r\n answers to the name of Xury. He started down the harbor under a close\r\n reefed mainsail, while we in the hold made repeated but unsuccessful\r\n efforts to escape, until Thomas Newcombe, wishing to be revenged upon\r\n his chief for relieving him of the command, unlocked the door and\r\n released us. We at once attacked the pirates, who made but a feeble\r\n resistance, and in a few moments they were all secured, except the\r\n chief, who jumped overboard rather than to fall into our hands. The\r\n vessel was put about by midshipman Richardson, who handled her during\r\n the fight, and brought her back to her anchorage.\r\n\r\n \"I regret to report that lieutenant Jackson, corporal Smith, and\r\n private Simmonds, were wounded during the struggle--the former being\r\n disabled by a thrust from a bayonet.\r\n\r\n \"I am sure that the Storm King sustained no injury during the run\r\n down and up the harbor, but, in order to establish this fact, I\r\n respectfully request that a Board of Survey be ordered to examine\r\n into her condition, and also that a Court of Inquiry be convened, to\r\n ascertain whether or not the honor of our flag has suffered in my\r\n hands\r\n\r\n  \"Very Respectfully,\r\n  Your Obd't Serv't\r\n  HENRY GREEN,\r\n  First Lieutenant, A. N.\r\n\r\n  \"Captain WILLIAM STEELE,\r\n  Commanding Academy Ship Storm King.\"\r\n\r\n (The letters A. N., which Harry placed after his rank, stood for\r\n Academy Navy.)\r\n\r\n\"How will that do, Jackson?\" inquired the first lieutenant, after he\r\nhad read the report to his wounded shipmate. \"I know that the Board of\r\nSurvey, and the Court of Inquiry will come, whether I ask for them or\r\nnot; but I have made the request, simply to show the principal that I\r\nam willing he should sift the matter as soon as he pleases. I can't\r\nthink of any order that I have disobeyed, but they are so hard on a\r\nfellow here, that I expect to have my appointment revoked.\"\r\n\r\nThe first lieutenant placed his report in an official envelope, and,\r\nafter addressing it to the captain, he went into his state-room and\r\ntumbled into bed. He did not sleep much; and neither did Tom Newcombe,\r\nwho, during the rest of the night, paced up and down his narrow prison\r\nlike a caged lion. Morning came much too soon for him, and, at the\r\nfirst peep of day, all hands were called, and Harry put off for shore\r\nin the jolly-boat. In half an hour he returned with a yawl, and took\r\nhis prisoners and Bob Jennings on board. The latter was landed outside\r\nthe academy grounds, and then the first lieutenant pushed off again to\r\ntake the Crusoe men before the principal. The fisher-boy would have\r\nbeen glad to accompany them, for he wanted to hear what the principal\r\nwould say to Tom. But other things demanded his attention. The first\r\nwas, to go home and relieve the anxiety which he knew his mother felt\r\nat his prolonged absence, and the other, to secure possession of the Go\r\nAhead No. 2, which had been left in the cave. He started off on a keen\r\nrun, and in a few minutes reached Fishertown, and burst into the house,\r\nwhere his mother was engaged in getting breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis sudden appearance took the family completely by surprise. It took\r\nsomebody else, who was not a member of the family, also by surprise,\r\nand that was Mr. Graves, the boat-builder, who had \"just dropped in\"\r\nat that early hour, to inquire if Mrs. Jennings had heard any news of\r\nBob. He felt a great interest in him, he said, and was anxious to know\r\nwhat had become of him. The fisher-boy's mother, however, very soon\r\ndiscovered that he did not care so much about the welfare of her son as\r\nabout the money Bob had promised to pay him for the Go Ahead No. 2.\r\n\r\nEver since the fisher-boy's disappearance, Mr. Graves had been a very\r\nmiserable man. He had come to the conclusion that he had been sadly\r\ndeceived in his customer, and he believed that Bob had run away to\r\navoid paying the debt. This was enough to put him on nettles.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was well off in the world, he was very \"close\" in all his\r\ndealings, and, in his eyes, twenty-six dollars was a small fortune. He\r\nhad credited Bob for the skiff, not because he wished to assist him,\r\nbut for the reason that he believed his customer's promise to pay was\r\nalmost as good as the money. If the fisher-boy had been able to pay\r\ncash for his boat, he could have bought her for twenty dollars; but\r\nwhen the boat-builder found that he was expected to wait three months\r\nfor his money, he had added five dollars to the price of the skiff for\r\ninterest. It made no difference to him that he was rich and Bob poor.\r\nThat was no fault of his. He had a right to make as much money as he\r\ncould, and this was a lawful business transaction.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that it has turned out this way, Mrs. Jennings,\" said the\r\nboat-builder, \"but I can't help it. Of course you can't expect me to\r\nbuild fine skiffs, like the Go Ahead No. 2, for nothing! I couldn't\r\nmake a living by doing business that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry that you let Bob have that boat on credit,\" said Mrs.\r\nJennings.\r\n\r\n\"So am I, when it is too late. If the boat was here, and in good\r\norder, I would take it back; but as it is gone, you, of course, will\r\nacknowledge that I ought to be paid for it. I didn't suppose that a\r\nboy who bore the reputation of your Robert would become such a rascal!\r\nIt is plain enough to me that he has run away. I'll warrant that he is\r\nin South America by this time, and that you'll never see him----Bobby\r\nJennings!\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy's appearance at this moment proved to Mr. Graves's\r\nentire satisfaction that he was not in South America. He stood in the\r\ndoor-way, flushed with excitement, breathing hard after his rapid run,\r\nand looking first at his mother and then at the boat-builder, who did\r\nnot act as if he thought him a very great rascal. As soon as Bob had\r\ngreeted his mother, he arose and shook hands with him, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have concluded to come back, Bobby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Concluded!\" repeated the fisher-boy. That one word opened his eyes,\r\nand he imagined he knew the object of the boat-builder's visit. \"You\r\ndidn't suppose I had run away, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to tell the honest truth, we did, Bobby,\" replied Mr. Graves,\r\nsettling back in his chair, as if he was willing to listen to any\r\nexplanation the fisher-boy had to make. \"You see, every thing pointed\r\nthat way. You go in debt for a splendid little skiff, somebody steals\r\nher from you, you don't pay a cent on your note, and you suddenly\r\ndisappear, and nobody knows were you have gone. What else could we\r\nsuppose? There are no such things as kidnappers nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was such a thing as a Crusoe band, though!\" replied Bob, who\r\nwas astonished and indignant that any one should suppose him mean\r\nand dishonest enough to absent himself on account of a paltry debt\r\nof twenty-six dollars. He knew that all his acquaintances would be\r\nsurprised at his absence, but he had never imagined that they would\r\naccuse him of running away.\r\n\r\n\"There was a--what did you call that band, Bobby?\" inquired Mr. Graves,\r\nbending forward in his chair, and placing his hand behind his ear.\r\n\r\n\"What would I run away for?\" demanded the fisher-boy, who did not\r\nfeel disposed to favor his creditor with an explanation, after he had\r\naccused him so wrongfully. \"My three months are not up yet, Mr. Graves.\r\nWhen the time comes you shall have your money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so. I certainly hope so,\" said the boat-builder, picking up\r\nhis hat, for he plainly saw that Bob did not want him there. \"You will\r\nunderstand, of course, that the fact of your losing the boat does\r\nnot affect the debt. Have I your promise that you will remain in the\r\nvillage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir. I live here,\" replied the fisher-boy, rather coldly.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves bowed himself out, and returned to his ship-yard breathing a\r\ngood deal easier. He was certain that his twenty-six dollars were safe.\r\nHis mind was easy on that score, but his curiosity had been excited,\r\nand he would have been almost willing to give the price of the boat to\r\nknow where his customer had been, and what he had been doing during his\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bobby, tell me all about it,\" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as the\r\ndoor had closed behind their visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Before I begin, mother, answer me one question,\" said the fisher-boy.\r\n\"Did you believe that I had run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nBob drew a long breath of relief. There was at least one person in the\r\nworld who still had faith in him. Seating himself in a chair by his\r\nmother's side, he related his story just as he had told it to the\r\nexecutive officer of the Storm King, and wound up by saying--\"I am not\r\nsorry for what has happened. I know that I have been kept from my work,\r\nbut I have found my skiff, and now I am going after it.\"\r\n\r\nBob did go. He put a piece of candle in his pocket--for the lantern\r\nthat had been used in the cave was on board the yacht--and started off\r\nwithout waiting for his breakfast, although he had not eaten a mouthful\r\nsince the previous morning. He went straight to the wharf, and his\r\nappearance there occasioned a great commotion among the ferry-boys, who\r\nclimbed out of their boats, and gathered about him, even neglecting the\r\npassengers who were waiting to be carried across the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been, Bobby, an' where's Sam Barton, an' Bill Stevens,\r\nan' Jack Bennett, an' the rest of them fellers?\" inquired half a dozen\r\nof the boys at once.\r\n\r\n\"If one of you will lend me a boat for ten minutes, and go with me,\r\nI'll tell you all about it,\" was Bob's reply.\r\n\r\nOf course, the boys would go with him, and they could spare their\r\nboats for ten minutes, or for all day, for that matter. Of the boats\r\noffered him, the fisher-boy climbed down into the one that suited him\r\nbest, and, to the no small amazement of the boys, sculled under the\r\nwharf. A half a dozen boats kept close behind him, their crews making\r\nunsuccessful attempts to induce Bob to tell them the meaning of his\r\nstrange movements. The latter said nothing, until he had gathered all\r\nthe boys about him in the cave, and then he told his story. If he had\r\nnever had an appreciative audience before, he had one now, and he was\r\nobliged to relate over and over again the particulars of his capture\r\nand the fight with the dog, as well as all the other incidents that had\r\ntranspired while he was a prisoner. Every one wondered what had become\r\nof the governor, and all were anxious to know what Bob intended to do\r\nwith the members of the band. But, in this matter, the fisher-boy kept\r\nhis own counsel.\r\n\r\nAfter the ferry-boys had examined the cave to their satisfaction, and\r\nlistened to all Bob had to say about Crusoe and his men, they assisted\r\nhim in getting the Go Ahead No. 2 into the water. When Sam found that\r\nhe would not be allowed an opportunity to dispose of the skiff, he had\r\ntaken care to preserve every thing that belonged to her. The sail and\r\nthe oars lay upon the thwarts, where they had been placed when the\r\nskiff was first brought into the cave, and so did the stake to which\r\nshe had been chained. She was as good as new in every respect, and the\r\nfisher-boy could not refrain from shouting with delight, when he saw\r\nher floating in the water, under the pier.\r\n\r\nBob's story spread with great rapidity, and he soon found that he\r\nwas quite a hero in the village. If he had felt so disposed, he\r\ncould have spent half the day in relating his adventures to admiring\r\nlisteners. But his time was too valuable to be wasted. He took four\r\nor five passengers across the harbor, who made a great many inquiries\r\nconcerning the Crusoe band; but he answered them in as few words as\r\npossible, and, as soon as he could get away from them, he started for\r\nhome. There he disposed of a hasty breakfast, and, an hour afterward,\r\nthe Go Ahead No. 2 was anchored on his fishing grounds, and Bob\r\nwas sitting with his line dangling in the water, thinking over his\r\nadventures, and waiting patiently for a bite. But, contrary to his\r\nexpectations, he soon found that the fish were quite as able to resist\r\nthe temptation of a bait suspended over the side of his fine skiff,\r\nas they had been when it was thrown to them from his old scow. His\r\nsplendid boat made no difference with their biting; and at night, when\r\nhe filled away for home, his fish-basket was as empty as when he made\r\nhis last trip down the bay, in the old Go Ahead. Ferrying was a little\r\nmore profitable. He carried eight passengers across the harbor that\r\nnight, by which he made sixteen cents.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy had been indulging in the hope that the loss of his two\r\nboats, and his long absence from his work, would operate as a sort of\r\ncharm to break the \"streak of bad luck,\" that had so long attended him\r\nin his fishing and ferrying. But in this he was disappointed. The fish\r\nwere as shy of his hook as they had been two months before, and one day\r\non the harbor opened his eyes to the fact that his skiff was altogether\r\ntoo small. Morning and evening were the busy times with the ferry-boys,\r\nfor then the ship-carpenters went to and from their work. There were\r\nso many boys in the harbor, that none of them could make more than one\r\ntrip before the passengers were all carried across, and, consequently,\r\nthe boy who had the largest and cleanest boat made the most money. For\r\nexample, the yawl that Sam Barton had used would easily accommodate\r\ntwenty-five persons, and Bob's skiff would not hold more than nine; so,\r\nwhile Sam made fifty cents with every \"full trip,\" the fisher-boy made\r\nonly eighteen.\r\n\r\nBob worked early and late, but luck was still against him, and, at the\r\nend of the week, he had saved only a dollar, which he paid into the\r\nhands of Mr. Graves, who indorsed it on the back of his note. During\r\nthe second week, he laid by a quarter less, and he began to believe\r\nthat his mother knew what she was talking about when she told him that\r\nit was a great deal easier to go in debt than to get out of it. How\r\nmany times he wished for the five-dollar bill he had given Tom Newcombe\r\nto invest in the lottery!\r\n\r\nDuring the month following, Bob led a most uncomfortable life. He\r\ngave up fishing, and finished Mr. Henry's pile of wood, for which he\r\nreceived six dollars, which was also paid to Mr. Graves. The day on\r\nwhich the note fell due came at last, and so did the boat-builder, who,\r\nin a business-like way, informed Bob that he still owed him seventeen\r\ndollars, and that he would \"give him the benefit of the usual three\r\ndays' grace.\" The fisher-boy did not know exactly what that meant, but\r\nhe did know that it was simply impossible for him to raise so large\r\nan amount, of money in so short a time. How often did he wish that\r\nthe forty dollars in gold, which his mother still preserved--although\r\nshe had more than once been at a loss to know where the next meal was\r\ncoming from--belonged to him! But he would as soon have thought of\r\nbreaking into Mr. Newcombe's office, and stealing seventeen dollars, as\r\nto use a portion of that to pay for his boat.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the visit of the boat-builder, as Bob was\r\nsculling slowly about the harbor, looking for passengers, he was hailed\r\nby a man on the wharf, who, as he came up, pulled a memorandum-book\r\nfrom his pocket, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I am collecting for Mr. Graves, and I have a little bill of seventeen\r\ndollars against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't pay it,\" replied the fisher-boy, hanging down his head, and\r\nlooking as mean as if he had been detected in robbing somebody's\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my orders are to give you back your nine dollars, and\r\nto take the boat,\" said the man. \"Mr. Graves says he has been sadly\r\ndeceived in you. You told him a falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss of the boat was a severe blow to Bob, but the knowledge that\r\nhis reputation had suffered by his failure to keep his promise, was\r\nstill worse. But that was not all. Mr. Henry and Mr. Newcombe were\r\nstanding upon the wharf, and there were several ferry-boys close\r\nby. The two gentlemen opened their eyes and looked at Bob in great\r\nsurprise, while one of the ferry-boys, delighted to witness the\r\ndiscomfiture of a rival, whispered,\r\n\r\n\"Bobby's been tryin' to play the swell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for us! There's one more out of the way!\" said another.\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy laid the oars carefully upon the thwarts, passed the\r\nskiff's painter up to the collector, and climbed upon the wharf without\r\nsaying a word. He took the note and the money the man handed to him,\r\nand stood watching him as he sprang down into the skiff, and pulled\r\nup the harbor toward the ship-yard. As soon as he disappeared among\r\nthe shipping, Bob tore up the note, put his money into his pocket, and\r\nwalked slowly homeward. He wanted to get out of sight of those two\r\ngentlemen, and away from the ferry-boys, who kept their eyes fastened\r\non him as if he had been some curious wild animal. He felt like an\r\noutlaw, and it seemed to him that every man who passed him on the\r\nwharf, looked upon him with contempt.\r\n\r\n\"I'll always believe what mother says, after this,\" said the fisher-boy\r\nto himself. \"I am out of debt now, and, if I don't keep out, I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, here you are!\" exclaimed a voice, breaking in upon his reverie.\r\n\"The best oarsman on Newport harbor! We've been looking for you! We\r\nwant to go across!\"\r\n\r\nBob looked up, and found his liberal passenger before him, the man who\r\nhad paid him the forty dollars in gold by mistake. He had looked and\r\nwatched for him every time he came into the harbor, and here he was,\r\nwhen he the least expected him. He was accompanied by two gentlemen,\r\nwhom Bob knew to be sailors, from their style of dress.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, boy!\" exclaimed the man, talking very rapidly, \"the\r\ncaptain and I are in a great hurry, and I know that you can set us over\r\nin a little less than no time. Where's your boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got any, sir!\" replied the fisher-boy, with tears in his\r\neyes. \"But do you know how much you paid me when you were here before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I promised you a dollar, and I gave it to you, didn't I?\" said\r\nthe man, pulling out his pocket-book. \"Did I make a mistake? How much\r\ndo I owe you? Speak quick, for I don't like to have even a small debt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't owe me any thing, sir,\" said Bob, as soon as he saw a chance\r\nto crowd a word in edgeways; \"but I owe you forty dollars in gold, and\r\nif you will come home with me, I will pay it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You owe me forty dollars!\" repeated the man. \"How does that come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you made a great mistake, sir. You gave me two twenty-dollar gold\r\npieces instead of the two silver half dollars you promised me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a big dunce I was, and what a bigger dunce you are, for telling\r\nme of it,\" said the man, looking at Bob with an expression he could not\r\nunderstand. \"Come on, captain, we've wasted time enough.\"\r\n\r\nTo the fisher-boy's astonishment, the man turned on his heel and walked\r\noff without saying a word more about the money. He shook hands with\r\nMr. Henry, who was still standing on the wharf, and Bob heard him\r\ninquire, \"Who is that boy?\" He did not hear the reply, for the grocer\r\nturned his back to him. Bob thought if he had lost forty dollars, and\r\nsome one should offer to return it, he would pay more attention to the\r\nmatter; but perhaps the gentleman had so many twenty-dollar gold pieces\r\nthat the loss of two of them did not trouble him. He talked with Mr.\r\nHenry until a yawl, which he had hailed, came up, and then he climbed\r\ndown into it, saying to the grocer: \"I will call at your store this\r\nafternoon.\" Upon hearing this the fisher-boy started for home again,\r\nintending to take the money to Mr. Henry, with a request that he would\r\ngive it to the owner.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jennings was not at all surprised when Bob told her that Mr.\r\nGraves had taken his boat away from him. She only said it was \"just\r\nwhat she had been expecting,\" and then listened patiently as the\r\nfisher-boy unfolded his plans for the future. They were not very\r\nnumerous or complicated, for now that his skiff was gone, there was but\r\none way in which he could earn a livelihood, and that was by doing odd\r\njobs about the village. \"As for going to sea,\" said Bob, \"I have almost\r\ngiven it up. I never can save thirty dollars, and I'll have to be a\r\nfisherman as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he felt the tears coming to his eyes, and, to hide\r\nhis emotion, he went out of the house, sat down upon the ground,\r\nand looked up at his mottoes, under the eaves. \"I don't believe Mr.\r\nNewcombe told the truth,\" said he, unconsciously giving utterance to\r\nthe thoughts that were passing through his mind.\r\n\r\n\"About what?\" inquired a voice behind him. Bob looked up, and there\r\nwas his liberal passenger again. Without stopping to reply to his\r\nquestion, the fisher-boy sprang to his feet and ran into the cabin. In\r\na few moments he returned with the gold pieces, and found the gentleman\r\ntrying to read the mottoes. He took the money when Bob offered it to\r\nhim, without even thanking him, and, placing his finger upon one of the\r\nboards, inquired: \"What's all this written here?\".\r\n\r\n\"It's my motto,\" replied Bob, with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"It is written in Greek, isn't it? Read it. I would like to know what\r\nit is?\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy hesitated again. He was afraid the gentleman might laugh\r\nat him. When he first cut that motto there, he thought it was something\r\nworth remembering; but now he had almost lost faith in it. The man\r\nrepeated his request, and looked at Bob so kindly that he complied and\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"_Be sure you are right, and then go ahead!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you always live up to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not always,\" replied the fisher-boy, looking down at the ground; \"I\r\nwent ahead once when I knew I was wrong, and got into trouble by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you come to select this for a motto?\r\n\r\n\"I heard Mr. Newcombe talking to Tom just before he sailed in the\r\nSavannah. He said: 'Be sure you are right, and then go ahead, and I'll\r\nanswer for your success in life.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And if Tom had been sensible enough to pay some attention to it, he\r\nwould have been of some use in the world now,\" said the gentleman. \"He\r\ngoes ahead when he knows he is wrong, and that's the reason he gets\r\ninto so much trouble. What's the other motto?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Owe no man a penny_,\" replied Bob.\r\n\r\n\"That's another good one. All the advice I can give you is, to keep\r\nthem constantly in mind.\"\r\n\r\nAs the man said this, he abruptly left Bob, and walked rapidly toward\r\nthe wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the fisher-boy to himself, \"he is the queerest man I ever\r\nsaw.\"\r\n\r\nBob was astonished at his singular behavior, and about an hour\r\nafterward, while he was eating his dinner, he was still more amazed by\r\nthe appearance of one of the sailors he had seen with Mr. Evans--for\r\nthat was the name of his liberal passenger--who entered without\r\nknocking, and began his business without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"I am Captain Coons, master of the ship Spartan, which is to sail from\r\nthis port for China, day after to-morrow,\" said he. \"Be gone three\r\nyears, probably. Want a boy, and have been instructed by Mr. Evans,\r\nmy owner, to pay you a hundred dollars advance. What do you say, Bob?\r\nHere's your chance. You needn't mind pumping for salt water about it,\r\nfor I am in dead earnest. Here's the money if you'll say you will put\r\ndown your name.\"\r\n\r\nBob could not say any thing immediately, for he found it impossible to\r\nspeak. He looked at the roll of bills the captain held in his hand,\r\nthen at his mother, and being unable to restrain himself any longer,\r\nhe jumped up and ran out of the house. He did not shout, but he made a\r\nstanding jump of eight feet and a-half, and then began to haul in an\r\nimaginary rope, hand over hand.\r\n\r\n\"What do I say, Bob?\" said he to himself, in an excited whisper. \"I say\r\nI'll go, and won't I do my best? Captain Coons's boots will shine so\r\nthat he can see his face in them a mile off; and he'll never have to\r\ntell somebody to make the bunks over after me.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisher-boy did not say, \"I'll soon be second mate, and then first\r\nmate, and then captain,\" as Tom Newcombe had done. His ideas extended\r\nno further, just then, than the faithful performance of his duties as\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nBob took a good many steps about the beach, and made several more\r\nlong standing jumps before he worked off his excitement, and then\r\nhe returned to the house, where he found the captain engaged in\r\nconversation with his mother. He saw, at a glance, that the matter had\r\nbeen settled during his absence, for his mother's purse lay upon the\r\ntable, and it was larger than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n\"Those mottoes did it, my lad,\" said the captain, after he had told\r\nMrs. Jennings that Mr. Evans had heard all of Bob's history from the\r\ngrocer. \"They pleased my owner wonderfully; and he asked me to tell\r\nyou to bear one thing in mind, and that is, that a steady, honest,\r\nindustrious boy never wants for friends, be he rich or poor. I shall\r\nexpect to see you on board the Spartan at six o'clock this evening.\"\r\n\r\nBob reported to the captain promptly at the hour. A small portion of\r\nhis advance had been expended for an outfit; but when he stood on the\r\ndeck of his vessel, and waved his farewell to his mother, he knew that\r\nhe had left her provided for.\r\n\r\n\"That's what comes of giving back them gold pieces,\" said Xury,\r\nstanding up in his boat and waving his hat to the fisher-boy. \"If he\r\nhad kept 'em, like the governor wanted him to do, he wouldn't be on\r\nboard that fine ship now.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one of the members of the band saw Bob start on his voyage, and\r\nit must be confessed that they breathed easier than they had done for\r\nmany a day, when they beheld his vessel shaping her course down the\r\nbay. The principal had dismissed them with a sharp reprimand, and,\r\nwhen they resumed their work in the harbor, they lived in a state of\r\nconstant fear and excitement, expecting every moment to find Mr. Grimes\r\nafter them with a warrant. The fact that Bob spoke to them very civilly\r\nwhenever he met them did not make them feel secure, and not until they\r\nsaw his vessel fairly out of the harbor, were they satisfied that he\r\ndid not intend to have them punished for what they had done. Then\r\nevery one of them was sorry that they had treated him so unkindly, and,\r\nif the fisher-boy had come back to the village, he never would have had\r\nany more trouble with the old members of the Crusoe band.\r\n\r\nTom Newcombe was there also. In spite of all his remonstrances and\r\nthreats, the lieutenant had taken him before the principal of the\r\nacademy, who sternly ordered him to go home. This made Tom more angry\r\nthan ever, for he imagined the colonel had insulted him by treating him\r\nso coldly in the presence of the students, and he determined that he\r\nwould yet be revenged upon him. What passed between him and his father\r\nno one ever knew; but all the clerks remarked that Tom worked harder,\r\nand that he spent less of his time in running around. His brain was\r\nas busy as usual, and in twenty-four hours after his release he had\r\nmatured a plan for the organization of another secret society.\r\n\r\nThe future of a boy of Tom's habits is easily predicted. The only\r\nchannel in which he ever exhibited any perseverance, was in holding\r\nto the belief that \"nobody could teach him.\" To this opinion he clung\r\nas long as he lived, and, of course, he often got into trouble. His\r\nfurther adventures shall be related in \"NO MOSS; OR, THE CAREER OF A\r\nROLLING STONE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamous Castlemon Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo author of the present day has become a greater favorite with boys\r\nthan \"Harry Castlemon,\" every book by him is sure to meet with hearty\r\nreception by young readers generally.
