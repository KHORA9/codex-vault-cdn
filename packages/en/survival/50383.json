All are convinced\r\nthat rivers have come to be what they are by slow processes of natural\r\ndevelopment, in which every peculiarity of river-course and valley-form\r\nhas its appropriate cause. Being fully persuaded of the gradual and\r\nsystematic evolution of topographic forms, it is now desired, in\r\nstudying the rivers and valleys of Pennsylvania, to seek the causes of\r\nthe location of the streams in their present courses; to go back if\r\npossible to the early date when central Pennsylvania was first raised\r\nabove the sea and trace the development of the several river systems\r\nthen implanted upon it from their ancient beginning to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe existing topography and drainage system of the State will first be\r\nbriefly described. We must next inquire into the geological structure\r\nof the region, follow at least in a general way the deformations and\r\nchanges of attitude and altitude that it has suffered, and consider the\r\namount of denudation that has been accomplished on its surface. We must\r\nat the same time bear in mind the natural history of rivers, their\r\nmorphology and development; we must recognize the varying activities of\r\na river in its youth and old age, the adjustments of its adolescence\r\nand maturity, and the revival of its decrepit powers when the land that\r\nit drains is elevated and it enters a new cycle of life. Finally we\r\nshall attempt to follow out the development of the rivers of\r\nPennsylvania by applying the general principles of river history to the\r\nspecial case of Pennsylvania structure.\r\n\r\n2. _General description of the topography of Pennsylvania_.--The\r\nstrongly marked topographic districts of Pennsylvania can hardly be\r\nbetter described than by quoting the account given over a century ago\r\nby Lewis Evans, of Philadelphia, in his \"Analysis of a map of the\r\nmiddle British colonies in America\" (1755), which is as valuable from\r\nits appreciative perception as it is interesting from its early date.\r\nThe following paragraphs are selected from his early pages:\r\n\r\n\"The land southwestward of Hudson's River is more regularly divided and\r\ninto a greater number of stages than the other. The first object worthy\r\nof regard in this part is a rief or vein of rocks of the talky or\r\nisinglassy kind, some two or three or half a dozen miles broad; rising\r\ngenerally some small matter higher than the adjoining land; and\r\nextending from New York city southwesterly by the lower falls of\r\nDelaware, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Gun-Powder, Patapsco, Potomack,\r\nRapahannock, James river and Ronoak. This was the antient maritime\r\nboundary of America and forms a very regular curve. The land between\r\nthis rief and the sea and from the Navesink hills southwest ... may be\r\ndenominated the Lower Plains, and consists of soil washt down from\r\nabove and sand accumulated from the ocean. Where these plains are not\r\npenetrated by rivers, they are a white sea-sand, about twenty feet deep\r\nand perfectly barren, as no mixture of soil helps to enrich them. But\r\nthe borders of the rivers, which descend from the uplands, are rendered\r\nfertile by the soil washt down with the floods and mixt with the sands\r\ngathered from the sea. The substratum of sea-mud, shells and other\r\nforeign subjects is a perfect confirmation of this supposition. And\r\nhence it is that for 40 or 50 miles inland and all the way from the\r\nNavesinks to Cape Florida, all is a perfect barren where the wash from\r\nthe uplands has not enriched the borders of the rivers; or some ponds\r\nand defiles have not furnished proper support for the growth of white\r\ncedars....\r\n\r\n\"From this rief of rocks, over which all the rivers fall, to that chain\r\nof broken hills, called the South mountain, there is the distance of\r\n50, 60 or 70 miles of very uneven ground, rising sensibly as you\r\nadvance further inland, and may be denominated the Upland. This\r\nconsists of veins of different kinds of soil and substrata some scores\r\nof miles in length; and in some places overlaid with little ridges and\r\nchains of hills. The declivity of the whole gives great rapidity to the\r\nstreams; and our violent gusts of rain have washt it all into gullies,\r\nand carried down the soil to enrich the borders of the rivers in the\r\nLower Plains. These inequalities render half the country not easily\r\ncapable of culture, and impoverishes it, where torn up by the plow, by\r\ndaily washing away the richer mould that covers the surface.\r\n\r\n\"The South mountain is not in ridges like the Endless mountains, but in\r\nsmall, broken, steep, stoney hills; nor does it run with so much\r\nregularity. In some places it gradually degenerates to nothing, not to\r\nappear again for some miles, and in others it spreads several miles in\r\nbreadth. Between South mountain and the hither chain of the Endless\r\nmountains (often for distinction called the North mountain, and in some\r\nplaces the Kittatinni and Pequélin), there is a valley of pretty even\r\ngood land, some 8, 10 or 20 miles wide, and is the most considerable\r\nquantity of valuable land that the English are possest of; and runs\r\nthrough New Jersey, Pensilvania, Mariland and Virginia. It has yet\r\nobtained no general name, but may properly enough be called Piemont,\r\nfrom its situation. Besides conveniences always attending good land,\r\nthis valley is everywhere enriched with Limestone.\r\n\r\n\"The Endless mountains, so called from a translation of the Indian name\r\nbearing that signification, come next in order. They are not confusedly\r\nscattered and in lofty peaks overtopping one another, but stretch in\r\nlong uniform ridges scarce half a mile perpendicular in any place above\r\nthe intermediate vallies. Their name is expressive of their extent,\r\nthough no doubt not in a literal sense.... The mountains are almost all\r\nso many ridges with even tops and nearly of a height. To look from\r\nthese hills into the lower lands is but, as it were, into an ocean of\r\nwoods, swelled and deprest here and there by little inequalities, not\r\nto be distinguished one part from another any more than the waves of\r\nthe real ocean. The uniformity of these mountains, though debarring us\r\nof an advantage in this respect, makes some amends in another. They are\r\nvery regular in their courses, and confine the creeks and rivers that\r\nrun between; and if we know where the gaps are that let through these\r\nstreams, we are not at a loss to lay down their most considerable\r\ninflections....\r\n\r\n\"To the northwestward of the Endless mountains is a country of vast\r\nextent, and in a manner as high as the mountains themselves. To look at\r\nthe abrupt termination of it, near the sea level, as is the case on the\r\nwest side of Hudson's river below Albany, it looks as a vast high\r\nmountain; for the Kaats Kills, though of more lofty stature than any\r\nother mountains in these parts of America, are but the continuation of\r\nthe Plains on the top, and the cliffs of them in the front they present\r\ntowards Kinderhook. These Upper Plains are of extraordinary rich level\r\nland, and extend from the Mohocks river through the country of the\r\nConfederates.[2] Their termination northward is at a little distance\r\nfrom Lake Ontario; but what it is westward is not known, for those most\r\nextensive plains of Ohio are part of them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Referring to the league of Indian tribes, so-called.]\r\n\r\nThese several districts recognized by Evans may be summarized as the\r\ncoastal plain, of nearly horizontal Cretaceous and later beds, just\r\nentering the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania; the marginal upland\r\nof contorted schists of disputed age; the South Mountain belt of\r\nancient and much disturbed crystalline rocks, commonly called Archean;\r\na space between these two traversed by the sandstone lowland of the\r\nNewark formation;[3] the great Appalachian valley of crowded Cambrian\r\nlimestones and slates; the region of the even-crested, linear Paleozoic\r\nridges, bounded by Kittatinny or Blue mountain on the southeast and by\r\nAlleghany mountain on the northwest, this being the area with which we\r\nare here most concerned; and finally the Alleghany plateau, consisting\r\nof nearly horizontal Devonian and Carboniferous beds and embracing all\r\nthe western part of the state. The whole region presents the most\r\nemphatic expression not only of its structure but also of the more\r\nrecent cycles of development through which it has passed. Fig. 1\r\nrepresents the stronger ridges and larger streams of the greater part\r\nof the central district: it is reproduced from the expressive\r\nTopographic Map of Pennsylvania (1871) by Lesley. The Susquehanna flows\r\ndown the middle, receiving the West Branch from Lock Haven and\r\nWilliamsport, the East Branch from Wilkes-Barre in the Wyoming basin,\r\nand the Juniata from the Broad Top region, south of Huntingdon. The\r\nAnthracite basins lie on the right, enclosed by zigzag ridges of Pocono\r\nand Pottsville sandstone; the Plateau, trenched by the West Branch of\r\nthe Susquehanna is in the northwest. Medina sandstone forms most of the\r\ncentral ridges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Russell has lately recommended the revival of this term,\r\nproposed many years ago by Redfield, as a non-committal name for the\r\n\"New red sandstones\" of our Atlantic slope, commonly called Triassic.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Part of Topographic Map of Pennsylvania, by J.\r\nP. Lesley (1871).]\r\n\r\n3. _The drainage of Pennsylvania_.--The greater part of the Alleghany\r\nplateau is drained westward into the Ohio, and with this we shall have\r\nlittle to do. The remainder of the plateau drainage reaches the\r\nAtlantic by two rivers, the Delaware and the Susquehanna, of which the\r\nlatter is the more special object of our study. The North and West\r\nBranches of the Susquehanna rise in the plateau, which they traverse in\r\ndeep valleys; thence they enter the district of the central ranges,\r\nwhere they unite and flow in broad lowlands among the even-crested\r\nridges. The Juniata brings the drainage of the Broad Top region to the\r\nmain stream just before their confluent current cuts across the\r\nmarginal Blue Mountain. The rock-rimmed basins of the anthracite region\r\nare drained by small branches of the Susquehanna northward and\r\nwestward, and by the Schuylkill and Lehigh to the south and east. The\r\nDelaware, which traverses the plateau between the Anthracite region and\r\nthe Catskill Mountain front, together with the Lehigh, the Schuylkill,\r\nthe little Swatara and the Susquehanna, cut the Blue Mountain by fine\r\nwater-gaps, and cross the great limestone valley. The Lehigh then turns\r\neastward and joins the Delaware, and the Swatara turns westward to the\r\nSusquehanna; but the Delaware, Schuylkill and Susquehanna all continue\r\nacross South Mountain and the Newark belt, and into the low plateau of\r\nschists beyond. The Schuylkill unites with the Delaware near\r\nPhiladelphia, just below the inner margin of the coastal plain; the\r\nDelaware and the Susquehanna continue in their deflected estuaries to\r\nthe sea. All of these rivers and many of their side streams are at\r\npresent sunk in small valleys of moderate depth and width, below the\r\ngeneral surface of the lowlands, and are more or less complicated with\r\nterrace gravels.\r\n\r\n4. _Previous studies of Appalachian drainage_.--There have been no\r\nspecial studies of the history of the rivers of Pennsylvania in the\r\nlight of what is now known of river development. A few recent essays of\r\nrather general character as far as our rivers are concerned, may be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nPeschel examined our rivers chiefly by means of general maps with\r\nlittle regard to the structure and complicated history of the region.\r\nHe concluded that the several transverse rivers which break through the\r\nmountains, namely, the Delaware, Susquehanna and Potomac, are guided by\r\nfractures, anterior to the origin of the rivers.[4] There does not seem\r\nto be sufficient evidence to support this obsolescent view, for most of\r\nthe water-gaps are located independently of fractures; nor can\r\nPeschel's method of river study be trusted as leading to safe\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Physische Erdkunde, 1880, ii, 442.]\r\n\r\nTietze regards our transverse valleys as antecedent;[5] but this was\r\nmade only as a general suggestion, for his examination of the structure\r\nand development of the region is too brief to establish this and\r\nexclude other views.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Jahrbuch Geol. Reichsanstalt, xxviii, 1878, 600.]\r\n\r\nLöwl questions the conclusion reached by Tietze and ascribes the\r\ntransverse gaps to the backward or headwater erosion of external\r\nstreams, a process which he has done much to bring into its present\r\nimportant position, and which for him replaces the persistence of\r\nantecedent streams of other authors.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Pet. Mitth., 1882, 405; Ueber Thalbildung, Prag, 1884.]\r\n\r\nA brief article[7] that I wrote in comment on Löwl's first essay\r\nseveral years ago now seems to me insufficient in its method. It\r\nexaggerated the importance of antecedent streams; it took no sufficient\r\naccount of the several cycles of erosion through which the region has\r\ncertainly passed; and it neglected due consideration of the\r\nreadjustment of initial immature stream courses during more advanced\r\nriver-life. Since then, a few words in Löwl's essay have come to have\r\nmore and more significance to me; he says that in mountain systems of\r\nvery great age, the original arrangement of the longitudinal valleys\r\noften becomes entirely confused by means of their conquest by\r\ntransverse erosion gaps. This suggestion has been so profitable to me\r\nthat I have placed the original sentence at the beginning of this\r\npaper. Its thesis is the essential element of my present study.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Origin of Cross-valleys. Science, i, 1883, 325.]\r\n\r\nPhillipson refers to the above-mentioned authors and gives a brief\r\naccount of the arrangement of drainage areas within our Appalachians,\r\nbut briefly dismisses the subject.[8] His essay contains a serviceable\r\nbibliography.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Studien über Wasserscheiden. Leipsig, 1886, 149.]\r\n\r\nIf these several earlier essays have not reached any precise\r\nconclusion, it may perhaps be because the details of the geological\r\nstructure and development of Pennsylvania have not been sufficiently\r\nexamined. Indeed, unless the reader has already become familiar with\r\nthe geological maps and reports of the Pennsylvania surveys and is\r\nsomewhat acquainted with its geography, I shall hardly hope to make my\r\ncase clear to him. The volumes that should be most carefully studied\r\nare, first, the always inspiring classic, \"Coal and its Topography\"\r\n(1856), by Lesley, in which the immediate relation of our topography to\r\nthe underlying structure is so finely described; the Geological Map of\r\nPennsylvania (1856), the result of the labors of the first survey of\r\nthe state; and the Geological Atlas of Counties, Volume X of the second\r\nsurvey (1885). Besides these, the ponderous volumes of the final report\r\nof the first survey and numerous reports on separate counties by the\r\nsecond survey should be examined, as they contain many accounts of the\r\ntopography although saying very little about its development. If, in\r\naddition to all this, the reader has seen the central district of the\r\nstate and marvelled at its even-crested, straight and zigzag ridges,\r\nand walked through its narrow water-gaps into the enclosed coves that\r\nthey drain, he may then still better follow the considerations here\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND. _Outline of the geological history of the region_.\r\n\r\n5. _Conditions of formation_.--The region in which the Susquehanna and\r\nthe neighboring rivers are now located is built in chief part of marine\r\nsediments derived in paleozoic time from a large land area to the\r\nsoutheast, whose northwest coast-line probably crossed Pennsylvania\r\nsomewhere in the southeastern part of the state; doubtless varying its\r\nposition, however, by many miles as the sea advanced and receded in\r\naccordance with the changes in the relative altitudes of the land and\r\nwater surfaces, such as have been discussed by Newberry and Claypole.\r\nThe sediments thus accumulated are of enormous thickness, measuring\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand feet from their crystalline foundation to the\r\nuppermost layer now remaining. The whole mass is essentially\r\nconformable in the central part of the state. Some of the formations\r\nare resistent, and these have determined the position of our ridges;\r\nothers are weaker and are chosen as the sites of valleys and lowlands.\r\nThe first are the Oneida and Medina sandstones, which will be here\r\ngenerally referred to under the latter name alone, the Pocono sandstone\r\nand the Pottsville conglomerate; to these may be added the fundamental\r\ncrystalline mass on which the whole series of bedded formations was\r\ndeposited, and the basal sandstone that is generally associated with\r\nit. Wherever we now see these harder rocks, they rise above the\r\nsurrounding lowland surface. On the other hand, the weaker beds are the\r\nCambrian limestones (Trenton) and slates (Hudson River), all the\r\nSilurian except the Medina above named, the whole of the Devonian--in\r\nwhich however there are two hard beds of subordinate value, the\r\nOriskany sandstone and a Chemung sandstone and conglomerate, that form\r\nlow and broken ridges over the softer ground on either side of\r\nthem--and the Carboniferous (Mauch Chunk) red shales and some of the\r\nweaker sandstones (Coal measures).\r\n\r\n6. _Former extension of strata to the southeast_.--We are not much\r\nconcerned with the conditions under which this great series of beds was\r\nformed; but, as will appear later, it is important for us to recognize\r\nthat the present southeastern margin of the beds is not by any means\r\ntheir original margin in that direction. It is probable that the whole\r\nmass of deposits, with greater or less variations of thickness,\r\nextended at least twenty miles southeast of Blue Mountain, and that\r\nmany of the beds extended much farther. The reason for this conclusion\r\nis a simple one. The several resistant beds above-mentioned consist of\r\nquartz sand and pebbles that cannot be derived from the underlying beds\r\nof limestones and shales; their only known source lay in the\r\ncrystalline rocks of the paleozoic land to the southeast. South\r\nMountain may possibly have made part of this paleozoic land; but it\r\nseems more probable that it was land only during the earlier Archean\r\nage, and that it was submerged and buried in Cambrian time and not\r\nagain brought to the light of day until it had been crushed into many\r\nlocal anticlines[9] whose crests were uncovered by Permian and later\r\nerosion. The occurrence of Cambrian limestone on either side of South\r\nMountain, taken with its compound anticlinal structure, makes it likely\r\nthat Medina time found this crystalline area entirely covered by the\r\nCambrian beds; Medina sands must therefore have come from farther still\r\nto the southeast. A similar argument applies to the source of the\r\nPocono and Pottsville beds. The measure of twenty miles as the former\r\nsoutheastern extension of the paleozoic formations therefore seems to\r\nbe a moderate one for the average of the whole series; perhaps forty\r\nwould be nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Lesley, as below.]\r\n\r\n7. _Cambro-Silurian and Permian deformations_.--This great series of\r\nonce horizontal beds is now wonderfully distorted; but the distortions\r\nfollow a general rule of trending northeast and southwest, and of\r\ndiminishing in intensity from southeast to northwest. In the Hudson\r\nValley, it is well known that a considerable disturbance occurred\r\nbetween Cambrian and Silurian time, for there the Medina lies\r\nunconformably on the Hudson River shales. It seems likely, for reasons\r\nthat will be briefly given later on, that the same disturbance extended\r\ninto Pennsylvania and farther southwest, but that it affected only the\r\nsoutheastern corner of the State; and that the unconformities in\r\nevidence of it, which are preserved in the Hudson Valley, are here lost\r\nby subsequent erosion. Waste of the ancient land and its\r\nCambro-Silurian annex still continued and furnished vast beds of\r\nsandstone and sandy shales to the remaining marine area, until at last\r\nthe subsiding Paleozoic basin was filled up and the coal marshes\r\nextended broadly across it. At this time we may picture the drainage of\r\nthe southeastern land area wandering rather slowly across the great\r\nCarboniferous plains to the still submerged basin far to the west; a\r\ncondition of things that is not imperfectly represented, although in a\r\nsomewhat more advanced stage, by the existing drainage of the mountains\r\nof the Carolinas across the more modern coastal plain to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis condition was interrupted by the great Permian deformation that\r\ngave rise to the main ranges of the Appalachians in Pennsylvania,\r\nVirginia and Tennessee. The Permian name seems appropriate here, for\r\nwhile the deformation may have begun at an earlier date, and may have\r\ncontinued into Triassic time, its culmination seems to have been within\r\nPermian limits. It was characterized by a resistless force of\r\ncompression, exerted in a southeast-northwest line, in obedience to\r\nwhich the whole series of Paleozoic beds, even twenty or more thousand\r\nfeet in thickness, was crowded gradually into great and small folds,\r\ntrending northeast and southwest. The subjacent Archean terrane\r\ndoubtless shared more or less in the disturbance: for example, South\r\nMountain is described by Lesley as \"not one mountain, but a system of\r\nmountains separated by valleys. It is, geologically considered, a\r\nsystem of anticlinals with troughs between.... It appears that the\r\nSouth Mountain range ends eastward [in Cumberland and York Counties] in\r\na hand with five [anticlinal] fingers.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., xiii, 1873, 6.]\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded with fair probability that the folds began to rise\r\nin the southeast, where they are crowded closest together, some of them\r\nhaving begun here while coal marshes were still forming farther west;\r\nand that the last folds to be begun were the fainter ones on the\r\nplateau, now seen in Negro mountain and Chestnut and Laurel ridges. In\r\nconsequence of the inequalities in the force of compression or in the\r\nresistance of the yielding mass, the folds do not continue indefinitely\r\nwith horizontal axes, but vary in height, rising or falling away in\r\ngreat variety. Several adjacent folds often follow some general control\r\nin this respect, their axes rising and falling together. It is to an\r\nunequal yielding of this kind that we owe the location of the\r\nAnthracite synclinal basins in eastern Pennsylvania, the Coal Measures\r\nbeing now worn away from the prolongation of the synclines, which rise\r\nin either direction.\r\n\r\n8. _Perm-Triassic denudation_.--During and for a long time after this\r\nperiod of mountain growth, the destructive processes of erosion wasted\r\nthe land and lowered its surface. An enormous amount of material was\r\nthus swept away and laid down in some unknown ocean bed. We shall speak\r\nof this as the Perm-Triassic period of erosion. A measure of its vast\r\naccomplishment is seen when we find that the Newark formation, which is\r\ngenerally correlated with Triassic or Jurassic time, lies unconformably\r\non the eroded surface of Cambrian and Archean rocks in the southeastern\r\npart of the State, where we have concluded that the Paleozoic series\r\nonce existed; where the strata must have risen in a great mountain mass\r\nas a result of the Appalachian deformations; and whence they must\r\ntherefore have been denuded before the deposition of the Newark beds.\r\nNot only so; the moderate sinuosity of the southeastern or under\r\nboundary of the Newark formation indicates clearly enough that the\r\nsurface on which that portion of the formation lies is one of no great\r\nrelief or inequality; and such a surface can be carved out of an\r\nelevated land only after long continued denudation, by which\r\ntopographic development is carried beyond the time of its greatest\r\nstrength or maturity into the fainter expression of old age. This is a\r\nmatter of some importance in our study of the development of the rivers\r\nof Pennsylvania; and it also constitutes a good part of the evidence\r\nalready referred to as indicating that there must have been some\r\nearlier deformations of importance in the southeastern part of the\r\nState; for it is hardly conceivable that the great Paleozoic mass could\r\nhave been so deeply worn off of the Newark belt between the making of\r\nthe last of the coal beds and the first of the Newark. It seems more in\r\naccordance with the facts here recounted and with the teachings of\r\ngeological history in general to suppose, as we have here, that\r\nsomething of the present deformation of the ancient rocks underlying\r\nthe Newark beds was given at an early date, such as that of the Green\r\nMountain growth; and that a certain amount of the erosion of the folded\r\nbeds was thus made possible in middle Paleozoic time; then again at\r\nsome later date, as Permian, a second period of mountain growth\r\narrived, and further folding was effected, and after this came deeper\r\nerosion; thus dividing the destructive work that was done into several\r\nparts, instead of crowding it all into the post-Carboniferous time\r\nordinarily assigned to it. It is indeed not impossible that an\r\nimportant share of what we have called the Permian deformation was, as\r\nabove suggested, accomplished in the southeastern part of the State\r\nwhile the coal beds were yet forming in the west; many grains of sand\r\nin the sandstones of the Coal Measures may have had several temporary\r\nhalts in other sandstone beds between the time of their first erosion\r\nfrom the Archean rocks and the much later time when they found the\r\nresting place that they now occupy.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: These considerations may have value in showing that the\r\ntime in which the lateral crushing of the Appalachians was accomplished\r\nwas not so brief as is stated by Reade in a recent article in the\r\nAmerican Geologist, iii, 1889, 106.]\r\n\r\n9. _Newark deposition_.--After the great Paleozoic and Perm-Triassic\r\nerosions thus indicated, when the southeastern area of ancient\r\nmountains had been well worn down and the Permian folds of the central\r\ndistrict had acquired a well developed drainage, there appeared an\r\nopportunity for local deposition in the slow depression of a\r\nnortheast-southwest belt of the deeply wasted land, across the\r\nsoutheastern part of the State; and into this trough-like depression,\r\nthe waste from the adjacent areas on either side was carried, building\r\nthe Newark formation. This may be referred to as the Newark or\r\nTrias-Jurassic period of deposition. The volume of this formation is\r\nunknown, as its thickness and original area are still undetermined; but\r\nit is pretty surely of many thousand feet in vertical measure, and its\r\noriginal area may have been easily a fifth or a quarter in excess of\r\nits present area, if not larger yet. So great a local accumulation\r\nseems to indicate that while the belt of deposition was sinking, the\r\nadjacent areas were rising, in order to furnish a continual supply of\r\nmaterial; the occurrence of heavy conglomerates along the margins of\r\nthe Newark formation confirms this supposition, and the heavy breccias\r\nnear Reading indicate the occurrence of a strong topography and a\r\nstrong transporting agent to the northwest of this part of the Newark\r\nbelt. It will be necessary, when the development of the ancestors of\r\nour present rivers is taken up, to consider the effects of the\r\ndepression that determined the locus of Newark deposition and of the\r\nadjacent elevation that maintained a supply of material.\r\n\r\n10. _Jurassic tilting_.--Newark deposition was stopped by a gradual\r\nreversal of the conditions that introduced it. The depression of the\r\nNewark belt was after a time reversed into elevation, accompanied by a\r\npeculiar tilting, and again the waste of the region was carried away to\r\nsome unknown resting place. This disturbance, which may be regarded as\r\na revival of the Permian activity, culminated in Jurassic, or at least\r\nin post-Newark time, and resulted in the production of the singular\r\nmonoclinal attitude of the formation; and as far as I can correlate it\r\nwith the accompanying change in the underlying structures, it involved\r\nthere an over-pushing of the closed folds of the Archean and Paleozoic\r\nrocks. This is illustrated in figs. 2 and 3, in which the original and\r\ndisturbed attitudes of the Newark and the underlying formations are\r\nroughly shown, the over-pushing of the fundamental folds causing the\r\nmonoclinal and probably faulted structure in the overlying beds.[12] If\r\nthis be true, we might suspect that the unsymmetrical attitude of the\r\nAppalachian folds, noted by Rogers as a characteristic of the range, is\r\na feature that was intensified if not originated in Jurassic and not in\r\nPermian time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Amer. Journ. Science, xxxii, 1886, 342; and Seventh Ann.\r\nRept. U. S. Geol. Survey, 1888, 486.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the Jurassic deformation was limited to\r\nthe area of the Newark beds; it may have extended some way on either\r\nside; but it presumably faded out at no great distance, for it has not\r\nbeen detected in the history of the Atlantic and Mississippi regions\r\nremote from the Newark belt. In the district of the central folds of\r\nPennsylvania, with which we are particularly concerned, this\r\ndeformation was probably expressed in a further folding and\r\nover-pushing of the already partly folded beds, with rapidly decreasing\r\neffect to the northwest; and perhaps also by slip-faults, which at the\r\nsurface of the ground nearly followed the bedding planes: but this is\r\nevidently hypothetical to a high degree. The essential point for our\r\nsubsequent consideration is that the Jurassic deformation was probably\r\naccompanied by a moderate elevation, for it allowed the erosion of the\r\nNewark beds and of laterally adjacent areas as well.\r\n\r\n11. _Jura-Cretaceous denudation_.--In consequence of this elevation, a\r\nnew cycle of erosion was entered upon, which I shall call the\r\nJura-Cretaceous cycle. It allowed the accomplishment of a vast work,\r\nwhich ended in the production of a general lowland of denudation, a\r\nwide area of faint relief, whose elevated remnants are now to be seen\r\nin the even ridge-crests that so strongly characterize the central\r\ndistrict, as well as in certain other even uplands, now etched by the\r\nerosion of a later cycle of destructive work. I shall not here take\r\nspace for the deliberate statement of the argument leading to this end,\r\nbut its elements are as follows: the extraordinarily persistent\r\naccordance among the crest-line altitudes of many Medina and\r\nCarboniferous ridges in the central district; the generally\r\ncorresponding elevation of the western plateau surface, itself a\r\nsurface of erosion, but now trenched by relatively deep and narrow\r\nvalleys; the generally uniform and consistent altitude of the uplands\r\nin the crystalline highlands of northern New Jersey and in the South\r\nMountains of Pennsylvania; and the extension of the same general\r\nsurface, descending slowly eastward, over the even crest-lines of the\r\nNewark trap ridges. Besides the evidence of less continental elevation\r\nthus deduced from the topography, it may be noted that a lower stand of\r\nthe land in Cretaceous time than now is indicated by the erosion that\r\nthe Cretaceous beds have suffered in consequence of the elevation that\r\nfollowed their deposition. The Cretaceous transgression in the western\r\nstates doubtless bears on the problem also. Finally it may be fairly\r\nurged that it is more accordant with what is known about old mountains\r\nin general to suppose that their mass has stood at different attitudes\r\nwith respect to base level during their long period of denudation than\r\nto suppose that they have held one attitude through all the time since\r\ntheir deformation.\r\n\r\nIt is natural enough that the former maintenance of some lower altitude\r\nthan the present should have expression in the form of the country, if\r\nnot now extinguished by subsequent erosion. It is simply the reverse of\r\nthis statement that leads us to the above-stated conclusion. We may be\r\nsure that the long maintained period of relative quiet was of great\r\nimportance in allowing time for the mature adjustment of the rivers of\r\nthe region, and hence due account must be taken of it in a later\r\nsection. I say relative quiet, for there were certainly subordinate\r\noscillations of greater or less value; McGee has detected records of\r\none of these about the beginning of Cretaceous time, but its effects\r\nare not now known to be of geographic value; that is, they do not now\r\nmanifest themselves in the form of the present surface of the land, but\r\nonly in the manner of deposition and ancient erosion of certain\r\ndeposits.[13] Another subordinate oscillation in the sense of a\r\nmoderate depression seems to have extended through middle and later\r\nCretaceous time, resulting in an inland transgression of the sea and\r\nthe deposit of the Cretaceous formation unconformably on the previous\r\nland surface for a considerable distance beyond the present margin of\r\nthe formation.[14] This is important as affecting our rivers. Although\r\nthese oscillations were of considerable geological value, I do not\r\nthink that for the present purposes they call for any primary division\r\nof the Jura-Cretaceous cycle; for as the result of this long period of\r\ndenudation we find but a single record in the great lowland of erosion\r\nabove described, a record of prime importance in the geographic\r\ndevelopment of our region, that will often be referred to. The surface\r\nof faint relief then completed may be called the Cretaceous baselevel\r\nlowland. It may be pictured as a low, undulating plain of wide extent,\r\nwith a portion of its Atlantic margin submerged and covered over with a\r\nrelatively thin marine deposit of sands, marls and clays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Amer. Jour. Science, xxxv, 1888, 367, 448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This statement is based on a study of the geographic\r\nevolution of northern New Jersey, in preparation for publication.]\r\n\r\n12. _Tertiary elevation and denudation_.--This broad lowland is a\r\nlowland no longer. It has been raised over the greater part of its area\r\ninto a highland, with an elevation of from one to three thousand feet,\r\nsloping gently eastward and descending under the Atlantic level near\r\nthe present margin of the Cretaceous formation. The elevation seems to\r\nhave taken place early in Tertiary time, and will be referred to as of\r\nthat date. Opportunity was then given for the revival of the previously\r\nexhausted forces of denudation, and as a consequence we now see the\r\nformerly even surface of the plain greatly roughened by the incision of\r\ndeep valleys and the opening of broad lowlands on its softer rocks.\r\nOnly the harder rocks retain indications of the even surface which once\r\nstretched continuously across the whole area. The best indication of\r\nthe average altitude at which the mass stood through the greater part\r\nof post-Cretaceous time is to be found on the weak shales of the Newark\r\nformation in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and on the weak Cambrian\r\nlimestones of the great Kittatinny valley; for both of these areas have\r\nbeen actually almost baselevelled again in the Tertiary cycle. They\r\nwill be referred to as the Tertiary baselevel lowlands; and the valleys\r\ncorresponding to them, cut in the harder rocks, as well as the rolling\r\nlowlands between the ridges of the central district of Pennsylvania\r\nwill be regarded as of the same date. Whatever variations of level\r\noccurred in this cycle of development do not seem to have left marks of\r\nimportance on the inland surface, though they may have had greater\r\nsignificance near the coast.\r\n\r\n13. _Later changes of level_.--Again at the close of Tertiary time,\r\nthere was an elevation of moderate amount, and to this may be referred\r\nthe trenches that are so distinctly cut across the Tertiary baselevel\r\nlowland by the larger rivers, as well as the lateral shallower channels\r\nof the smaller streams. This will be called the Quaternary cycle; and\r\nfor the present no further mention of the oscillations known to have\r\noccurred in this division of time need be considered; the reader may\r\nfind careful discussion of them in the paper by McGee, above referred\r\nto. It is proper that I should add that the suggestion of baselevelling\r\nboth of the crest-lines and of the lowlands, that I have found so\r\nprofitable in this and other work, is due largely to personal\r\nconference with Messrs. Gilbert and McGee of the Geological Survey; but\r\nit is not desired to make them in any way responsible for the\r\nstatements here given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n14. _Illustrations of Pennsylvanian topography_.--A few sketches made\r\nduring a recent recess-trip with several students through Pennsylvania\r\nmay be introduced in this connection. The first, fig. 4, is a view from\r\nJenny Jump mountain, on the northwestern side of the New Jersey\r\nhighlands, looking northwest across the Kittatinny valley-lowland to\r\nBlue or Kittatinny mountain, where it is cut at the Delaware Water-gap.\r\nThe extraordinarily level crest of the mountain preserves record of the\r\nCretaceous baselevel lowland; since the elevation of this ancient\r\nlowland, its softer rocks have, as it were, been etched out, leaving\r\nthe harder ones in relief; thus the present valley-lowland is to be\r\nexplained. In consequence of the still later elevation of less amount,\r\nthe Delaware has cut a trench in the present lowland, which is partly\r\nseen to the left in the sketch. Fig. 5 is a general view of the Lehigh\r\nplateau and cañon, looking south from Bald Mountain just above Penn\r\nHaven Junction. Blue mountain is the most distant crest, seen for a\r\nlittle space. The ridges near and above Mauch Chunk form the other\r\noutlines; all rising to an astonishingly even altitude, in spite of\r\ntheir great diversity of structure. Before the existing valleys were\r\nexcavated, the upland surface must have been an even plain--the\r\nCretaceous baselevel lowland elevated into a plateau. The valleys cut\r\ninto the plateau during the Tertiary cycle are narrow here, because the\r\nrocks are mostly hard. The steep slopes of the cañon-like valley of the\r\nLehigh and the even crests of the ridges manifestly belong to different\r\ncycles of development. Figs. 6 and 7 are gaps cut in Black Log and\r\nShade mountain, by a small upper branch stream of the Juniata in\r\nsoutheastern Huntingdon county. The stream traverses a breached\r\nanticlinal of Medina sandstone, of which these mountains are the\r\nlateral members. A long narrow valley is opened on the axial Trenton\r\nlimestone between the two. The gaps are not opposite to each other, and\r\ntherefore in looking through either gap from the outer country the even\r\ncrest of the further ridge is seen beyond the axial valley. The gap in\r\nBlack Log mountain, fig. 6, is located on a small fracture, but in this\r\nrespect it is unlike most of its fellows.[15] The striking similarity\r\nof the two views illustrates the uniformity that so strongly\r\ncharacterizes the Medina ridges of the central district. Fig. 8 is in\r\ngood part an ideal view, based on sketches on the upper Susquehanna,\r\nand designed to present a typical illustration of the more significant\r\nfeatures of the region. It shows the even crest-lines of a high Medina\r\nor Pocono ridge in the background, retaining the form given to it in\r\nthe Cretaceous cycle; the even lowlands in the foreground, opened on\r\nthe weaker Siluro-Devonian rocks in the Tertiary cycle; and the uneven\r\nridges in the middle distance marking the Oriskany and Chemung beds of\r\nintermediate hardness that have lost the Cretaceous level and yet have\r\nnot been reduced to the Tertiary lowland. The Susquehanna flows\r\ndistinctly below the lowland plain, and the small side streams run in\r\nnarrow trenches of late Tertiary and Quaternary date.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Second Geol. Surv. Pa., Report T_{3}, 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nIf this interpretation is accepted, and the Permian mountains are seen\r\nto have been once greatly reduced and at a later time worn out, while\r\nthe ridges of to-day are merely the relief left by the etching of\r\nTertiary valleys in a Cretaceous baselevelled lowland, then we may well\r\nconclude with Powell that \"mountains cannot remain long as mountains;\r\nthey are ephemeral topographic forms.\"[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Geol. Uinta Mountains, 1876, 196.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD. _General conception of the history of a river_.\r\n\r\n15. _The complete cycle of river life: youth, adolescence, maturity and\r\nold age_.--The general outline of an ideal river's history may be now\r\nconsidered, preparatory to examining the special history of the rivers\r\nof Pennsylvania, as controlled by the geological events just narrated.\r\n\r\nRivers are so long lived and survive with more or less modification so\r\nmany changes in the attitude and even in the structure of the land,\r\nthat the best way of entering on their discussion seems to be to\r\nexamine the development of an ideal river of simple history, and from\r\nthe general features thus discovered, it may then be possible to\r\nunravel the complex sequence of events that leads to the present\r\ncondition of actual rivers of complicated history.\r\n\r\nA river that is established on a new land may be called an original\r\nriver. It must at first be of the kind known as a consequent river, for\r\nit has no ancestor from which to be derived. Examples of simple\r\noriginal rivers may be seen in young plains, of which southern New\r\nJersey furnishes a fair illustration. Examples of essentially original\r\nrivers may be seen also in regions of recent and rapid displacement,\r\nsuch as the Jura or the broken country of southern Idaho, where the\r\ndirectly consequent character of the drainage leads us to conclude\r\nthat, if any rivers occupied these regions before their recent\r\ndeformation, they were so completely extinguished by the newly made\r\nslopes that we see nothing of them now.\r\n\r\nOnce established, an original river advances through its long life,\r\nmanifesting certain peculiarities of youth, maturity and old age, by\r\nwhich its successive stages of growth may be recognized without much\r\ndifficulty. For the sake of simplicity, let us suppose the land mass,\r\non which an original river has begun its work, stands perfectly still\r\nafter its first elevation or deformation, and so remains until the\r\nriver has completed its task of carrying away all the mass of rocks\r\nthat rise above its baselevel. This lapse of time will be called a\r\ncycle in the life of a river. A complete cycle is a long measure of\r\ntime in regions of great elevation or of hard rocks; but whether or not\r\nany river ever passed through a single cycle of life without\r\ninterruption we need not now inquire. Our purpose is only to learn what\r\nchanges it would experience if it did thus develop steadily from\r\ninfancy to old age without disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn its infancy, the river drains its basin imperfectly; for it is then\r\nembarrassed by the original inequalities of the surface, and lakes\r\ncollect in all the depressions. At such time, the ratio of evaporation\r\nto rainfall is relatively large, and the ratio of transported land\r\nwaste to rainfall is small. The channels followed by the streams that\r\ncompose the river as a whole are narrow and shallow, and their number\r\nis small compared to that which will be developed at a later stage. The\r\ndivides by which the side-streams are separated are poorly marked, and\r\nin level countries are surfaces of considerable area and not lines at\r\nall. It is only in the later maturity of a system that the divides are\r\nreduced to lines by the consumption of the softer rocks on either side.\r\nThe difference between constructional forms and those forms that are\r\ndue to the action of denuding forces is in a general way so easily\r\nrecognized, that immaturity and maturity of a drainage area can be\r\nreadily discriminated. In the truly infantile drainage system of the\r\nRed River of the North, the inter-stream areas are so absolutely flat\r\nthat water collects on them in wet weather, not having either original\r\nstructural slope or subsequently developed denuded slope to lead it to\r\nthe streams. On the almost equally young lava blocks of southern\r\nOregon, the well-marked slopes are as yet hardly channeled by the flow\r\nof rain down them, and the depressions among the tilted blocks are\r\nstill undrained, unfilled basins.\r\n\r\nAs the river becomes adolescent, its channels are deepened and all the\r\nlarger ones descend close to baselevel. If local contrasts of hardness\r\nallow a quick deepening of the down-stream part of the channel, while\r\nthe part next up-stream resists erosion, a cascade or waterfall\r\nresults; but like the lakes of earlier youth, it is evanescent, and\r\nendures but a small part of the whole cycle of growth; but the falls on\r\nthe small headwater streams of a large river may last into its\r\nmaturity, just as there are young twigs on the branches of a large\r\ntree. With the deepening of the channels, there comes an increase in\r\nthe number of gulleys on the slopes of the channel; the gulleys grow\r\ninto ravines and these into side valleys, joining their master streams\r\nat right angles (La Noë and Margerie). With their continued\r\ndevelopment, the maturity of the system is reached; it is marked by an\r\nalmost complete acquisition of every part of the original\r\nconstructional surface by erosion under the guidance of the streams, so\r\nthat every drop of rain that falls finds a way prepared to lead it to a\r\nstream and then to the ocean, its goal. The lakes of initial\r\nimperfection have long since disappeared; the waterfalls of adolescence\r\nhave been worn back, unless on the still young headwaters. With the\r\nincrease of the number of side-streams, ramifying into all parts of the\r\ndrainage basin, there is a proportionate increase in the surface of the\r\nvalley slopes, and with this comes an increase in the rate of waste\r\nunder atmospheric forces; hence it is at maturity that the river\r\nreceives and carries the greatest load; indeed, the increase may be\r\ncarried so far that the lower trunk-stream, of gentle slope in its\r\nearly maturity, is unable to carry the load brought to it by the upper\r\nbranches, and therefore resorts to the temporary expedient of laying it\r\naside in a flood-plain. The level of the flood-plain is sometimes built\r\nup faster than the small side-streams of the lower course can fill\r\ntheir valleys, and hence they are converted for a little distance above\r\ntheir mouths into shallow lakes. The growth of the flood-plain also\r\nresults in carrying the point of junction of tributaries farther and\r\nfarther down stream, and at last in turning lateral streams aside from\r\nthe main stream, sometimes forcing them to follow independent courses\r\nto the sea (Lombardini). But although thus separated from the main\r\ntrunk, it would be no more rational to regard such streams as\r\nindependent rivers than it would be to regard the branch of an old\r\ntree, now fallen to the ground in the decay of advancing age, as an\r\nindependent plant; both are detached portions of a single individual,\r\nfrom which they have been separated in the normal processes of growth\r\nand decay.\r\n\r\nIn the later and quieter old age of a river system, the waste of the\r\nland is yielded slower by reason of the diminishing slopes of the\r\nvalley sides; then the headwater streams deliver less detritus to the\r\nmain channel, which, thus relieved, turns to its postponed task of\r\ncarrying its former excess of load to the sea, and cuts terraces in its\r\nflood-plain, preparatory to sweeping it away. It does not always find\r\nthe buried channel again, and perhaps settling down on a low spur a\r\nlittle to one side of its old line, produces a rapid or a low fall on\r\nthe lower slope of such an obstruction (Penck). Such courses may be\r\ncalled locally superimposed.\r\n\r\nIt is only during maturity and for a time before and afterwards that\r\nthe three divisions of a river, commonly recognized, appear most\r\ndistinctly; the torrent portion being the still young headwater\r\nbranches, growing by gnawing backwards at their sources; the valley\r\nportion proper, where longer time of work has enabled the valley to\r\nobtain a greater depth and width; and the lower flood-plain portion,\r\nwhere the temporary deposition of the excess of load is made until the\r\nactivity of middle life is past.\r\n\r\nMaturity seems to be a proper term to apply to this long enduring\r\nstage; for as in organic forms, where the term first came into use, it\r\nhere also signifies the highest development of all functions between a\r\nyouth of endeavor towards better work and an old age of relinquishment\r\nof fullest powers. It is the mature river in which the rainfall is best\r\nlead away to the sea, and which carries with it the greatest load of\r\nland waste; it is at maturity that the regular descent and steady flow\r\nof the river is best developed, being the least delayed in lakes and\r\nleast overhurried in impetuous falls.\r\n\r\nMaturity past, and the power of the river is on the decay. The relief\r\nof the land diminishes, for the streams no longer deepen their valleys\r\nalthough the hill tops are degraded; and with the general loss of\r\nelevation, there is a failure of rainfall to a certain extent; for it\r\nis well known that up to certain considerable altitudes rainfall\r\nincreases with height. A hyetographic and a hypsometric map of a\r\ncountry for this reason show a marked correspondence. The slopes of the\r\nheadwaters decrease and the valley sides widen so far that the land\r\nwaste descends from them slower than before. Later, what with failure\r\nof rainfall and decrease of slope, there is perhaps a return to the\r\nearly imperfection of drainage, and the number of side streams\r\ndiminishes as branches fall from a dying tree. The flood-plains of\r\nmaturity are carried down to the sea, and at last the river settles\r\ndown to an old age of well-earned rest with gentle flow and light load,\r\nlittle work remaining to be done. The great task that the river entered\r\nupon is completed.\r\n\r\n16. _Mutual adjustment of river courses_.--In certain structures,\r\nchiefly those of mountainous disorder on which the streams are at first\r\nhigh above baselevel, there is a process of adjustment extremely\r\ncharacteristic of quiet river development, by which the down-hill\r\ncourses that were chosen in early life, and as we may say unadvisedly\r\nand with the heedlessness and little foresight of youth, are given up\r\nfor others better fitted for the work of the mature river system. A\r\nchange of this kind happens when the young stream taking the lowest\r\nline for its guide happens to flow on a hard bed at a considerable\r\nheight above baselevel, while its branches on one side or the other\r\nhave opened channels on softer beds: a part of the main channel may\r\nthen be deserted by the withdrawal of its upper waters to a lower\r\ncourse by way of a side stream. The change to better adjustment also\r\nhappens when the initial course of the main stream is much longer than\r\na course that may be offered to its upper portion by the backward\r\ngnawing of an adjacent stream (Löwl, Penck). Sometimes the lateral\r\ncutting or planation that characterizes the main trunk of a mature\r\nriver gives it possession of an adjacent smaller stream whose bed is at\r\na higher level (Gilbert). A general account of these processes may be\r\nfound in Phillippson's serviceable \"Studien über Wasserscheiden\"\r\n(Leipzig, 1886). This whole matter is of much importance and deserves\r\ndeliberate examination. It should be remembered that changes in river\r\ncourses of the kind now referred to are unconnected with any external\r\ndisturbance of the river basin, and are purely normal spontaneous acts\r\nduring advancing development. Two examples, pertinent to our special\r\nstudy, will be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nLet AB, fig. 9, be a stream whose initial consequent course led it down\r\nthe gently sloping axial trough of a syncline. The constructional\r\nsurface of the syncline is shown by contours. Let the succession of\r\nbeds to be discovered by erosion be indicated in a section, laid in\r\nproper position on the several diagrams, but revolved into the\r\nhorizontal plane, the harder beds being dotted and the baselevel\r\nstanding at OO. Small side streams will soon be developed on the slopes\r\nof the syncline, in positions determined by cross-fractures or more\r\noften by what we call accident; the action of streams in similar\r\nsynclines on the outside of the enclosing anticlines will be omitted\r\nfor the sake of simplicity. In time, the side streams will cut through\r\nthe harder upper bed M and enter the softer bed N, on which\r\nlongitudinal channels, indicated by hachures, will be extended along\r\nthe strike, fig. 10 (La Noë and Margerie). Let these be called\r\n\"subsequent\" streams. Consider two side streams of this kind, C and D,\r\nheading against each other at E, one joining the main stream lower down\r\nthe axis of the syncline than the other. The headwaters of C will rob\r\nthe headwaters of D, because the deepening of the channel of D is\r\nretarded by its having to join the main stream at a point where the\r\nhard bed in the axis of the fold holds the main channel well above\r\nbaselevel. The notch cut by D will then be changed from a water-gap to\r\na wind-gap and the upper portion of D will find exit through the notch\r\ncut by C, as in fig. 11. As other subsequent headwaters make capture of\r\nC, the greater depth to which the lateral valley is cut on the soft\r\nrock causes a slow migration of the divides in the abandoned gaps\r\ntowards the main stream, and before long the upper part of the main\r\nstream itself will be led out of the synclinal axis to follow the\r\nmonoclinal valley at one side for a distance, fig. 12, until the axis\r\ncan be rejoined through the gap where the axial portion of the\r\ncontrolling hard bed is near or at baselevel. The upper part of the\r\nsynclinal trough will then be attacked by undercutting on the slope of\r\nthe quickly deepened channels of the lateral streams, and the hard bed\r\nwill be worn away in the higher part of the axis before it is consumed\r\nin the lower part. The location of the successful lateral stream on one\r\nor the other side of the syncline may be determined by the dip of the\r\nbeds, gaps being cut quicker on steep than on gentle dips. If another\r\nhard bed is encountered below the soft one, the process will be\r\nrepeated; and the mature arrangement of the streams will be as in fig.\r\n13 (on a smaller scale than the preceding), running obliquely off the\r\naxis of the fold where a hard bed of the syncline rises above\r\nbaselevel, and returning to the axis where the hard bed is below or at\r\nbaselevel; a monoclinal stream wandering gradually from the axis along\r\nthe strike of the soft bed, AE, by which the side-valley is located and\r\nreturning abruptly to the axis by a cataclinal[17] stream in a\r\ntransverse gap, EB, in the next higher hard bed, and there rejoining\r\nthe diminished representative or survivor of the original axial or\r\nsynclinal stream, GB.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See the terminology suggested by Powell. Expl. Col. R. of\r\nthe West, 1875, 160. This terminology is applicable only to the most\r\ndetailed study of our rivers, by reason of their crossing so many\r\nfolds, and changing so often from longitudinal to transverse courses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n17. _Terminology of rivers changed by adjustment_.--A special\r\nterminology is needed for easy reference to the several parts of the\r\nstreams concerned in such an adjustment. Let AB and CD, fig. 14, be\r\nstreams of unequal size cutting gaps, H and G, in a ridge that lies\r\ntransverse to their course. CD being larger than AB will deepen its gap\r\nfaster. Of two subsequent streams, JE and JF, growing on the up-stream\r\nside of the ridge, JE will have the steeper slope, because it joins the\r\ndeeper master-stream. The divide, J, will therefore be driven towards\r\nAB, and if all the conditions concerned conspire favorably, JE will at\r\nlast tap AB at F, and lead the upper part, AF, out by the line FEGD,\r\nfig. 15, through the deeper gap, G. We may then say that JE becomes the\r\n_divertor_ of AF, which is _diverted_; and when the process is\r\ncompleted, by the transfer of the divide from J, on the soft rocks, to\r\na stable location, H, on the hard rocks, there will be a short\r\n_inverted_ stream, HF; while HB is the remaining _beheaded_ portion of\r\nthe original stream, AB, and the water-gap of AB becomes a wind-gap, H.\r\nIt is very desirable that geographic exploration should discover\r\nexamples of the process of adjustment in its several stages. The\r\npreparatory stage is easily recognized by the difference in the size of\r\nthe two main streams, the difference in the depth of their gaps, and\r\nthe unsymmetrical position of the divide, J. The very brief stage of\r\ntransition gives us the rare examples of bifurcating streams. For a\r\nshort time after capture of the diverted stream by the divertor, the\r\nnew divide will lie between F and H, in an unstable position, the\r\nduration of this time depending on the energy of the process of\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe consequences resulting from readjustments of this kind by which\r\ntheir recent occurrence can be detected are: a relatively sudden\r\nincrease of volume of the divertor and hence a rapid deepening of the\r\ncourse of the diverting stream, FE, and of the diverted, AF, near the\r\npoint of capture; small side-streams of these two being unable to keep\r\npace with this change will join their masters in local rapids, which\r\nwork up stream gradually and fade away (Löwl, Penck, McGee). The\r\nexpanded portion, ED, of the larger stream, CD, already of faint slope,\r\nmay be locally overcome for a time with the increase of detritus that\r\nwill be thus delivered to it at the entrance, E, of the divertor; while\r\nthe beheaded stream, HB, will find itself embarrassed to live up to the\r\nhabits of its large valley [Heim]. Geographic exploration with these\r\nmatters in mind offers opportunity for the most attractive discoveries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n18. _Examples of adjustment_.--Another case is roughly figured in the\r\nnext three diagrams, figs. 16, 17, 18. Two adjacent synclinal streams,\r\nEA and HB, join a transverse master stream, C, but the synclines are of\r\ndifferent forms; the surface axis of one, EA, stands at some altitude\r\nabove baselevel until it nearly reaches the place of the transverse\r\nstream; while the axis of the other, HB, descends near baselevel at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the transverse stream. As lateral valleys, E\r\nand D, are opened on the anticline between the synclines by a process\r\nsimilar to that already described, the divide separating them will\r\nshift towards the stream of fainter slope, that is, towards the\r\nsyncline, EA, whose axis holds its hard beds above baselevel; and in\r\ntime the upper part of the main stream will be withdrawn from this\r\nsyncline to follow an easier course by crossing to the other, as in\r\nfig. 17. If the elevation of the synclinal axis, AES, take the shape of\r\na long flat arch, descending at the further end into a synclinal lake\r\nbasin, S, whose outlet is along the arching axis, SA, then the mature\r\narrangement of stream courses will lead the lake outlet away from the\r\naxis by some gap in the nearer ascending part of the arch where the\r\ncontrolling hard bed falls near to baselevel, as at F, fig. 18,[18] and\r\nwill take it by some subsequent course, FD, across the lowland that is\r\nopened on the soft beds between the synclines, and carry it into the\r\nlower syncline, HB, at D where the hard beds descend below baselevel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: This figure would be improved if a greater amount of\r\nwasting around the margin of the hard bed were indicated in comparison\r\nwith the preceding figure.]\r\n\r\nThe variety of adjustments following the general principle here\r\nindicated is infinite. Changes of greater or less value are thus\r\nintroduced in the initial drainage areas, until, after attaining an\r\nattitude of equilibrium, further change is arrested, or if occurring,\r\nis relatively insignificant. It should be noticed that the new stream\r\ncourses thus chosen are not named by any of the terms now current to\r\nexpress the relation of stream and land history; they are neither\r\nconsequent, antecedent nor superimposed. The stream is truly still an\r\noriginal stream, although no longer young; but its channel is not in\r\nall parts strictly consequent on the initial constructional form of the\r\nland that it drains. Streams thus re-arranged may therefore be named\r\noriginal streams of mature adjustment.\r\n\r\nIt should be clearly recognized that the process of adjustment is a\r\nvery slow one, unless measured in the extremely long units of a river's\r\nlife. It progresses no faster than the weathering away of the slopes of\r\na divide, and here as a rule weathering is deliberate to say the least,\r\nunless accelerated by a fortunate combination of favoring conditions.\r\nAmong these conditions, great altitude of the mass exposed to erosion\r\nstands first, and deep channeling of streams below the surface--that\r\nis, the adolescent stage of drainage development--stands second. The\r\nopportunity for the lateral migration of a divide will depend on the\r\ninequality of the slopes on its two sides, and here the most important\r\nfactors are length of the two opposite stream courses from the water\r\nparting to the common baselevel of the two, and inequality of structure\r\nby which one stream may have an easy course and the other a hard one.\r\nIt is manifest that all these conditions for active shifting of divides\r\nare best united in young and high mountain ranges, and hence it is that\r\nriver adjustments have been found and studied more in the Alps than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n19. _Revival of rivers by elevation and drowning by depression_.--I\r\nmake no contention that any river in the world ever passed through a\r\nsimple uninterrupted cycle of the orderly kind here described. But by\r\nexamining many rivers, some young and some old, I do not doubt that\r\nthis portrayal of the ideal would be found to be fairly correct if\r\nopportunity were offered for its development. The intention of the\r\nsketch is simply to prepare the way for the better understanding of our\r\nactual rivers of more complicated history.\r\n\r\nAt the close or at any time during the passage of an initial cycle such\r\nas the one just considered, the drainage area of a river system may be\r\nbodily elevated. The river is then turned back to a new youth and\r\nenters a new cycle of development. This is an extremely common\r\noccurrence with rivers, whose life is so long that they commonly\r\noutlive the duration of a quiescent stage in the history of the land.\r\nSuch rivers may be called revived. Examples may be given in which\r\nstreams are now in their second or third period of revival, the\r\nelevations that separate their cycles following so soon that but little\r\nwork was accomplished in the quiescent intervals.\r\n\r\nThe antithesis of this is the effect of depression, by which the lower\r\ncourse may be drowned, flooded or fjorded. This change is, if slow,\r\nfavorable to the development of flood-plains in the lower course; but\r\nit is not essential to their production. If the change is more rapid,\r\nopen estuaries are formed, to be transformed to delta-lowlands later\r\non.\r\n\r\n20. _Opportunity for new adjustments with revival_.--One of the most\r\ncommon effects of the revival of a river by general elevation is a new\r\nadjustment of its course to a greater or less extent, as a result of\r\nthe new relation of baselevel to the hard and soft beds on which the\r\nstreams had adjusted themselves in the previous cycle. Synclinal\r\nmountains are most easily explained as results of drainage changes of\r\nthis kind [Science, Dec. 21st, 1888]. Streams thus rearranged may be\r\nsaid to be adjusted through elevation or revival. It is to be hoped\r\nthat, as our study advances, single names of brief and appropriate form\r\nmay replace these paraphrases; but at present it seems advisable to\r\nkeep the desired idea before the mind by a descriptive phrase, even at\r\nthe sacrifice of brevity. A significant example may be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nLet it be supposed that an originally consequent river system has lived\r\ninto advanced maturity on a surface whose structure is, like that of\r\nPennsylvania, composed of closely adjacent anticlinal and synclinal\r\nfolds with rising and falling axes, and that a series of particularly\r\nresistant beds composes the upper members of the folded mass. The\r\nmaster stream, A, fig. 19, at maturity still resides where the original\r\nfolds were lowest, but the side streams have departed more less from\r\nthe axes of the synclinals that they first followed, in accordance with\r\nthe principles of adjustment presented above. The relief of the surface\r\nis moderate, except around the synclinal troughs, where the rising\r\nmargins of the hard beds still appear as ridges of more or less\r\nprominence. The minute hachures in figure 19 are drawn on the outcrop\r\nside of these ridges. Now suppose a general elevation of the region,\r\nlifting the synclinal troughs of the hard beds up to baselevel or even\r\nsomewhat above it. The deepening of the revived master-stream will be\r\ngreatly retarded by reason of its having to cross so many outcrops of\r\nthe hard beds, and thus excellent opportunity will be given for\r\nreadjustment by the growth of some diverting stream, B, whose beginning\r\non adjacent softer rocks was already made in the previous cycle. This\r\nwill capture the main river at some up-stream point, and draw it nearly\r\nall away from its hard path across the synclinal troughs to an easier\r\npath across the lowlands that had been opened on the underlying softer\r\nbeds, leaving only a small beheaded remnant in the lower course. The\r\nfinal re-arrangement may be indicated in fig. 20. It should be noted\r\nthat every capture of branches of the initial main stream made by the\r\ndiverting stream adds to its ability for further encroachments, for\r\nwith increase of volume the channel is deepened and a flatter slope is\r\nassumed, and the whole process of pushing away the divides is thereby\r\naccelerated. In general it may be said that the larger the stream and\r\nthe less its elevation above baselevel, the less likely is it to be\r\ndiverted, for with large volume and small elevation it will early cut\r\ndown its channel so close to baselevel that no other stream can offer\r\nit a better course to the sea; it may also be said that, as a rule, of\r\ntwo equal streams, the headwaters of the one having a longer or a\r\nharder course will be diverted by a branch of the stream on the shorter\r\nor easier course. Every case must therefore be examined for itself\r\nbefore the kind of re-arrangement that may be expected or that may have\r\nalready taken place can be discovered.\r\n\r\n21. _Antecedent and superimposed rivers_.--It not infrequently\r\nhappens that the surface, on which a drainage system is more or\r\nless fully developed, suffers deformation by tilting, folding or\r\nfaulting. Then, in accordance with the rate of disturbance, and\r\ndependent on the size and slope of the streams and the resistance of\r\nthe rocks, the streams will be more or less re-arranged, some of the\r\nlarger ones persisting in their courses and cutting their channels down\r\nalmost as fast as the mass below them is raised and offered to their\r\naction. It is manifest that streams of large volume and considerable\r\nslope are the ones most likely to persevere in this way, while small\r\nstreams and large ones of moderate slope may be turned from their\r\nformer courses to new courses consequent on the new constructional form\r\nof the land. Hence, after a disturbance, we may expect to find the\r\nsmaller streams of the former cycle pretty completely destroyed, while\r\nsome of the larger ones may still persist; these would then be called\r\nantecedent streams in accordance with the nomenclature introduced by\r\nPowell.[19] A fuller acquaintance with the development of our rivers\r\nwill probably give us examples of river systems of all degrees of\r\nextinction or persistence at times of disturbance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Exploration of the Colorada River of the West, 1875, 153,\r\n163-166.]\r\n\r\nSince Powell introduced the idea of antecedent valleys and Tietze,\r\nMedlicott and others showed the validity of the explanation in other\r\nregions than the one for which it was first proposed, it has found much\r\nacceptance. Löwl's objection to it does not seem to me to be nearly so\r\nwell founded as his suggestion of an additional method of river\r\ndevelopment by means of backward headwater erosion and subsequent\r\ncapture of other streams, as already described. And yet I cannot help\r\nthinking that the explanation of transverse valleys as antecedent\r\ncourses savors of the Gordian method of explaining a difficult matter.\r\nThe case of the Green river, to which Powell first gave this\r\nexplanation, seems well supported; the examples given by Medlicott in\r\nthe Himalayas are as good: but still it does not seem advisable to\r\nexplain all transverse streams in this way, merely because they are\r\ntransverse. Perhaps one reason why the explanation has become so\r\npopular is that it furnishes an escape from the old catastrophic idea\r\nthat fractures control the location of valleys, and is at the same time\r\nfully accordant with the ideas of the uniformitarian school that have\r\nbecome current in this half of our century. But when it is remembered\r\nthat most of the streams of a region are extinguished at the time of\r\nmountain growth, that only a few of the larger ones can survive, and\r\nthat there are other ways in which transverse streams may\r\noriginate,[20] it is evident that the possibility of any given\r\ntransverse stream being antecedent must be regarded only as a\r\nsuggestion, until some independent evidence is introduced in its favor.\r\nThis may be difficult to find, but it certainly must be searched for;\r\nif not then forthcoming, the best conclusion may be to leave the case\r\nopen until the evidence appears. Certainly, if we find a river course\r\nthat is accordant in its location with the complicated results of other\r\nmethods of origin, then the burden of proof may be said to lie with\r\nthose who would maintain that an antecedent origin would locate the\r\nriver in so specialized a manner. Even if a river persist for a time in\r\nan antecedent course, this may not prevent its being afterwards\r\naffected by the various adjustments and revivals that have been\r\nexplained above: rivers so distinctly antecedent as the Green and the\r\nSutlej may hereafter be more or less affected by processes of\r\nadjustment, which they are not yet old enough to experience. Hence in\r\nmountains as old as the Appalachians the courses of the present rivers\r\nneed not coincide with the location of the pre-Permian rivers, even if\r\nthe latter persisted in their courses through the growth of the Permian\r\nfolding; subsequent elevations and adjustments to hard beds, at first\r\nburied and unseen, may have greatly displaced them, in accordance with\r\nLöwl's principle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Hilber, Pet. Mitth., xxxv, 1889, 13.]\r\n\r\nWhen the deeper channelling of a stream discovers an unconformable\r\nsubjacent terrane, the streams persist at least for a time in the\r\ncourses that were determined in the overlying mass; they are then\r\ncalled superimposed (Powell), inherited (Shaler), or epigenetic\r\n(Richthofen). Such streams are particularly liable to readjustment by\r\ntransfer of channels from courses that lead them over hard beds to\r\nothers on which the hard beds are avoided; for the first choice of\r\nchannels, when the unconformable cover was still present, was made\r\nwithout any knowledge of the buried rock structure or of the\r\ndifficulties in which the streams would be involved when they\r\nencountered it. The examples of falls produced when streams terrace\r\ntheir flood-plains and run on buried spurs has already been referred to\r\nas superimposed; and the rivers of Minnesota now disclosing half-buried\r\nledges here and there may be instanced as illustrating the transition\r\nstage between simple consequent courses, determined by the form of the\r\ndrift sheet on which their flow began, and the fully inconsequent\r\ncourses that will be developed there in the future.\r\n\r\n22. _Simple, compound, composite and complex rivers_.--We have thus far\r\nconsidered an ideal river. It now seems advisable to introduce a few\r\nterms with which to indicate concisely certain well marked\r\npeculiarities in the history of actual rivers.\r\n\r\nAn original river has already been defined as one which first takes\r\npossession of a land area, or which replaces a completely extinguished\r\nriver on a surface of rapid deformation.\r\n\r\nA river may be simple, if its drainage area is of practically one kind\r\nof structure and of one age; like the rivers of southern New Jersey.\r\nSuch rivers are generally small. It may be composite, when drainage\r\nareas of different structure are included in the basin of a single\r\nstream. This is the usual case.\r\n\r\nA compound river is one which is of different ages in its different\r\nparts; as certain rivers of North Carolina, which have old headwaters\r\nrising in the mountains, and young lower courses traversing the coastal\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nA river is complex when it has entered a second or later cycle of\r\ndevelopment; the headwaters of a compound river are therefore complex,\r\nwhile the lower course may be simple, in its first cycle. The degree of\r\ncomplexity measures the number of cycles that the river has entered.\r\n\r\nWhen the study of rivers is thus attempted, its necessary complications\r\nmay at first seem so great as to render it of no value; but in answer\r\nto this I believe that it may be fairly urged that, although\r\ncomplicated, the results are true to nature, and if so, we can have no\r\nground of complaint against them. Moreover, while it is desirable to\r\nreduce the study of the development of rivers to its simplest form, in\r\norder to make it available for instruction and investigation, it must\r\nbe remembered that this cannot be done by neglecting to investigate the\r\nwhole truth in the hope of avoiding too great complexity, but that\r\nsimplicity can be reached safely only through fullness of knowledge, if\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIt is with these points in mind that I have attempted to decipher the\r\nhistory of the rivers of Pennsylvania. We find in the Susquehanna,\r\nwhich drains a great area in the central part of the state, an example\r\nof a river which is at once composite, compound and highly complex. It\r\ndrains districts of divers structure; it traverses districts of\r\ndifferent ages; and it is at present in its fourth or fifth degree of\r\ncomplexity, its fourth or fifth cycle of development at least. In\r\nunravelling its history and searching out the earlier courses of\r\nstreams which may have long since been abandoned in the processes of\r\nmature adjustment, it will be seen that the size of the present streams\r\nis not always a measure of their previous importance, and to this we\r\nmay ascribe the difficulty that attends the attempt to decipher a\r\nriver's history from general maps of its stream lines. Nothing but a\r\ndetailed examination of geological structure and history suffices to\r\ndetect facts and conditions that are essential to the understanding of\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nIf the postulates that I shall use seem unsound and the arguments seem\r\noverdrawn, error may at least be avoided by not holding fast to the\r\nconclusions that are presented, for they are presented only\r\ntentatively. I do not feel by any means absolutely persuaded of the\r\ncorrectness of the results, but at the same time deem them worth giving\r\nout for discussion. The whole investigation was undertaken as an\r\nexperiment to see where it might lead, and with the hope that it might\r\nlead at least to a serious study of our river problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOURTH. _The development of the rivers of Pennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n23. _Means of distinguishing between antecedent and adjusted consequent\r\nrivers_.--The outline of the geological history of Pennsylvania given\r\nabove affords means of dividing the long progress of the development of\r\nour rivers into the several cycles which make up their complete life.\r\nWe must go far back into the past and imagine ancient streams flowing\r\ndown from the Archean land towards the paleozoic sea; gaining length by\r\naddition to their lower portions as the land grew with the building on\r\nof successive mountain ranges; for example, if there were a\r\nCambro-Silurian deformation, a continuation of the Green Mountains into\r\nPennsylvania, we suppose that the pre-existent streams must in some\r\nmanner have found their way westward to the new coastline; and from the\r\ndate of this mountain growth, it is apparent that any streams then born\r\nmust have advanced far in their history before the greater Appalachian\r\ndisturbance began. At the beginning of the latter, as of the former,\r\nthere must have been streams running from the land into the sea, and at\r\ntimes of temporary elevation of the broad sand-flats of the coal\r\nmeasures, such streams must have had considerable additions to their\r\nlower length; rising in long-growing Archean highlands or mountains,\r\nsnow-capped and drained by glaciers for all we can say to the contrary,\r\ndescending across the Green Mountain belt, by that time worn to\r\nmoderate relief in the far advanced stage of its topographic\r\ndevelopment, and finally flowing across the coal-measure lowlands of\r\nrecent appearance. It was across the lower courses of such rivers that\r\nthe Appalachian folds were formed, and the first step in our problem\r\nconsists in deciding if possible whether the streams held their courses\r\nafter the antecedent fashion, or whether they were thrown into new\r\ncourses by the growing folds, so that a new drainage system would be\r\nformed. Possibly both conditions prevailed; the larger streams holding\r\ntheir courses little disturbed, and the smaller ones disappearing, to\r\nbe replaced by others as the slopes of the growing surface should\r\ndemand. It is not easy to make choice in this matter. To decide that\r\nthe larger streams persisted and are still to be seen in the greater\r\nrivers of to-day, only reversed in direction of flow, is certainly a\r\nsimple method of treating the problem, but unless some independent\r\nreasons are found for this choice, it savors of assumption. Moreover,\r\nit is difficult to believe that any streams, even if antecedent and\r\nmore or less persistent for a time during the mountain growth, could\r\npreserve till now their pre-Appalachian courses through all the varying\r\nconditions presented by the alternations of hard and soft rocks through\r\nwhich they have had to cut, and at all the different altitudes above\r\nbaselevel in which they have stood. A better means of deciding the\r\nquestion will be to admit provisionally the occurrence of a completely\r\noriginal system of consequent drainage, located in perfect accord with\r\nthe slopes of the growing mountains; to study out the changes of\r\nstream-courses that would result from later disturbances and from the\r\nmutual adjustments of the several members of such a system in the\r\ndifferent cycles of its history; and finally to compare the courses\r\nthus deduced with those now seen. If there be no accord, either the\r\nmethod is wrong or the streams are not consequent but of some other\r\norigin, such as antecedent; if the accord between deduction and fact be\r\nwell marked, varying only where no definite location can be given to\r\nthe deduced streams, but agreeing where they can be located more\r\nprecisely, then it seems to me that the best conclusion is distinctly\r\nin favor of the correctness of the deductions. For it is not likely,\r\neven if it be possible, that antecedent streams should have\r\naccidentally taken, before the mountains were formed, just such\r\nlocations as would have resulted from the subsequent growth of the\r\nmountains and from the complex changes in the initial river courses due\r\nto later adjustments. I shall therefore follow the deductive method\r\nthus indicated and attempt to trace out the history of a completely\r\noriginal, consequent system of drainage accordant with the growth of\r\nthe central mountain district.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, it is first necessary to restore the constructional\r\ntopography of the region; that is, the form that the surface would have\r\nhad if no erosion had accompanied its deformation. This involves\r\ncertain postulates which must be clearly conceived if any measure of\r\nconfidence is to be gained in the results based upon them.\r\n\r\n24. _Postulates of the argument_.--In the first place, I assume an\r\nessential constancy in the thickness of the paleozoic sediments over\r\nthe entire area in question. This is warranted here because the known\r\nvariations of thickness are relatively of a second order, and will not\r\naffect the distribution of high and low ground as produced by the\r\nintense Permian folding. The reasons for maintaining that the whole\r\nseries had a considerable extension southeast of the present margin of\r\nthe Medina sandstone have already been presented.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I shall assume that the dips and folds of the beds\r\nnow exposed at the surface of the ground may be projected upwards into\r\nthe air in order to restore the form of the eroded beds. This is\r\ncertainly inadmissible in detail, for it cannot be assumed that the\r\nfolded slates and limestones of the Nittany valley, for instance, give\r\nany close indication of the form that the coal measures would have\r\ntaken, had they extended over this district, unworn. But in a general\r\nway, the Nittany massif was a complex arch in the coal measures as well\r\nas in the Cambrian beds; for our purpose and in view of the moderate\r\nrelief of the existing topography, it suffices to say that wherever the\r\nlower rocks are now revealed in anticlinal structure, there was a great\r\nupfolding and elevation of the original surface; and wherever the\r\nhigher rocks are still preserved, there was a relatively small\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, I assume that by reconstructing from the completed\r\nfolds the form which the country would have had if unworn, we gain a\r\nsufficiently definite picture of the form through which it actually\r\npassed at the time of initial and progressive folding. The difference\r\nbetween the form of the folds completely restored and the form that the\r\nsurface actually reached is rather one of degree than of kind; the two\r\nmust correspond in the general distribution of high and low ground and\r\nthis is the chief consideration in our problem. When we remember how\r\naccurately water finds its level, it will be clearer that what is\r\nneeded in the discussion is the location of the regions that were\r\nrelatively raised and lowered, as we shall then have marked out the\r\ngeneral course of the consequent water ways and the trend of the\r\nintervening constructional ridges.\r\n\r\nAccepting these postulates, it may be said in brief that the outlines\r\nof the formations as at present exposed are in effect so many contour\r\nlines of the old constructional surface, on which the Permian rivers\r\ntook their consequent courses. Where the Trenton limestone is now seen,\r\nthe greatest amount of overlying strata must have been removed; hence\r\nthe outline of the Trenton formation is our highest contour line. Where\r\nthe Helderberg limestone appears, there has been a less amount of\r\nmaterial removed; hence the Helderberg outcrop is a contour of less\r\nelevation. Where the coal beds still are preserved, there has been\r\nleast wasting, and these beds therefore mark the lowest contour of the\r\nearly surface. It is manifest that this method assumes that the present\r\noutcrops are on a level surface; this is not true, for the ridges\r\nthrough the State rise a thousand feet more or less over the\r\nintervening valley lowlands, and yet the existing relief does not count\r\nfor much in discussing the enormous relief of the Permian surface that\r\nmust have been measured in tens of thousands of feet at the time of its\r\ngreatest strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Constructional Permian topography of\r\nPennsylvania.]\r\n\r\n25. _Constructional Permian topography and consequent drainage_.--A\r\nrough restoration of the early constructional topography is given in\r\nfig. 21 for the central part of the State, the closest shading being\r\nthe area of the Trenton limestone, indicating the highest ground, or\r\nbetter, the places of greatest elevation, while the Carboniferous area\r\nis unshaded, indicating the early lowlands. The prevalence of northeast\r\nand southwest trends was then even more pronounced than now. Several of\r\nthe stronger elements of form deserve names, for convenient reference.\r\nThus we have the great Kittatinny or Cumberland highland, C, C, on the\r\nsoutheast, backed by the older mountains of Cambrian and Archean rocks,\r\nfalling by the Kittatinny slope to the synclinal lowland troughs of the\r\ncentral district. In this lower ground lay the synclinal troughs of the\r\neastern coal regions, and the more local Broad Top basin, BT, on the\r\nsouthwest, then better than now deserving the name of basins. Beyond\r\nthe corrugated area that connected the coal basins rose the great\r\nNittany highland, N, and its southwest extension in the Bedford range,\r\nwith the less conspicuous Kishicoquilas highland, K, in the foreground.\r\nBeyond all stretched the great Alleghany lowland plains. The names thus\r\nsuggested are compounded of the local names of to-day and the\r\nmorphological names of Permian time.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the drainage of such a country? Deductively we are led to\r\nbelieve that it consisted of numerous streams as marked in full lines\r\non the figure, following synclinal axes until some master streams led\r\nthem across the intervening anticlinal ridges at the lowest points of\r\ntheir crests and away into the open country to the northwest. All the\r\nenclosed basins would hold lakes, overflowing at the lowest part of the\r\nrim. The general discharge of the whole system would be to the\r\nnorthwest. Here again we must resort to special names for the easy\r\nindication of these well-marked features of the ancient and now\r\napparently lost drainage system. The master stream of the region is the\r\ngreat Anthracite river, carrying the overflow of the Anthracite lakes\r\noff to the northwest and there perhaps turning along one of the faintly\r\nmarked synclines of the plateau and joining the original Ohio, which\r\nwas thus confirmed in its previous location across the Carboniferous\r\nmarshes. The synclinal streams that entered the Anthracite lakes from\r\nthe southwest may be named, beginning on the south, the Swatara, S,\r\nfig. 21, the Wiconisco, Wo, the Tuscarora-Mahanoy, M, the\r\nJuniata-Catawissa, C, and the Wyoming, Wy. One of these, probably the\r\nfourth, led the overflow from the Broad Top lake into the Catawissa\r\nlake on the middle Anthracite river. The Nittany highland formed a\r\nstrong divide between the central and northwestern rivers, and on its\r\nouter slope there must have been streams descending to the Alleghany\r\nlowlands; and some of these may be regarded as the lower courses of\r\nCarboniferous rivers, that once rose in the Archean mountains, now\r\nbeheaded by the growth of mountain ranges across their middle.\r\n\r\n26. _The Jura mountains homologous with the Permian\r\nAlleghanies_.--However willing one may be to grant the former existence\r\nof such a drainage system as the above, an example of a similar one\r\nstill in existence would be acceptable as a witness to the\r\npossibilities of the past. Therefore we turn for a moment to the Jura\r\nmountains, always compared to the Appalachians on account of the\r\nregular series of folds by which the two are characterized. But while\r\nthe initial topography is long lost in our old mountains, it is still\r\nclearly perceptible in the young Jura, where the anticlines are still\r\nridges and the longitudinal streams still follow the synclinal troughs;\r\nwhile the transverse streams cross from one synclinal valley to another\r\nat points where the intervening anticlinal arches are lowest.[21] We\r\ncould hardly ask for better illustration of the deductive drainage\r\nsystem of our early Appalachians than is here presented.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: This is beautifully illustrated in the recent monograph\r\nby La Noë and Margerie on \"Les Formes du Terrain.\"]\r\n\r\n27. _Development and adjustment of the Permian drainage_.--The problem\r\nis now before us. Can the normal sequence of changes in the regular\r\ncourse of river development, aided by the post-Permian deformations and\r\nelevations, evolve the existing rivers out of the ancient ones?\r\n\r\nIn order to note the degree of comparison that exists between the two,\r\nseveral of the larger rivers of to-day are dotted on the figure. The\r\npoints of agreement are indeed few and small. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant ones are that the Broad Top region is drained by a stream,\r\nthe Juniata, which for a short distance follows near the course\r\npredicted for it; and that the Nittany district, then a highland, is\r\nstill a well-marked divide although now a lowland. But there is no\r\nAnthracite river, and the region of the ancient coal-basin lakes is now\r\navoided by large streams; conversely, a great river--the\r\nSusquehanna--appears where no consequent river ran in Permian time, and\r\nthe early synclinal streams frequently turn from the structural troughs\r\nto valleys located on the structural arches.\r\n\r\n28. _Lateral water-gaps near the apex of synclinal ridges_.--One of the\r\nmost frequent discrepancies between the hypothetical and actual streams\r\nis that the latter never follow the axis of a descending syncline along\r\nits whole length, as the original streams must have done, but depart\r\nfor a time from the axis and then return to it, notching the ridge\r\nformed on any hard bed at the side instead of at the apex of its curve\r\nacross the axis of the syncline. There is not a single case in the\r\nstate of a stream cutting a gap at the apex of such a synclinal curve,\r\nbut there are perhaps hundreds of cases where the streams notch the\r\ncurve to one side of the apex. This, however, is precisely the\r\narrangement attained by spontaneous adjustment from an initial axial\r\ncourse, as indicated in figure 13. The gaps may be located on small\r\ntransverse faults, but as a rule they seem to have no such guidance. It\r\nis true that most of our streams now run out of and not into the\r\nsynclinal basins, but a reason for this will be found later; for the\r\npresent we look only at the location of the streams, not at their\r\ndirection of flow. As far as this illustration goes, it gives evidence\r\nthat the smaller streams at least possess certain peculiarities that\r\ncould not be derived from persistence in a previous accidental\r\nlocation, but which would be necessarily derived from a process of\r\nadjustment following the original establishment of strictly consequent\r\nstreams. Hence the hypothesis that these smaller streams were long ago\r\nconsequent on the Permian folding receives confirmation; but this says\r\nnothing as to the origin of the larger rivers, which might at the same\r\ntime be antecedent.\r\n\r\n29. _Departure of the Juniata from the Juniata-Catawissa syncline_.--It\r\nmay be next noted that the drainage of the Broad Top region does not\r\nfollow a single syncline to the Anthracite region, as it should have in\r\nthe initial stage of the consequent Permian drainage, but soon turns\r\naside from the syncline in which it starts and runs across country to\r\nthe Susquehanna. It is true that in its upper course the Juniata\r\ndeparts from the Broad Top region by one of the two synclines that were\r\nindicated as the probable line of discharge of the ancient Broad Top\r\nlake in our restoration of the constructional topography of the State;\r\nthere does not appear to be any significant difference between the\r\nsummit altitudes of the Tuscarora-Mahanoy and the Juniata-Catawissa\r\nsynclinal axes and hence the choice must have been made for reasons\r\nthat cannot be detected; or it may be that the syncline lying more to\r\nthe northwest was raised last, and for this reason was taken as the\r\nline of overflow. The beginning of the river is therefore not\r\ndiscordant with the hypothesis of consequent drainage, but the\r\nsouthward departure from the Catawissa syncline at Lewistown remains to\r\nbe explained. It seems to me that some reason for the departure may be\r\nfound by likening it to the case already given in figs. 16-18. The\r\nseveral synclines with which the Juniata is concerned have precisely\r\nthe relative attitudes that are there discussed. The Juniata-Catawissa\r\nsyncline has parallel sides for many miles about its middle, and hence\r\nmust have long maintained the initial Juniata well above baselevel over\r\nall this distance; the progress of cutting down a channel through all\r\nthe hard Carboniferous sandstones for so great a distance along the\r\naxis must have been exceedingly slow. But the synclines next south, the\r\nTuscarora-Mahanoy and the Wiconisco, plunge to the northeast more\r\nrapidly, as the rapid divergence of their margins demonstrates, and\r\nmust for this reason have carried the hard sandstones below baselevel\r\nin a shorter distance and on a steeper slope than in the Catawissa\r\nsyncline. The further southwestward extension of the Pocono sandstone\r\nridges in the southern than in the northern syncline gives further\r\nillustration of this peculiarity of form. Lateral capture of the\r\nJuniata by a branch of the initial Tuscarora, and of the latter by a\r\nbranch of the Wiconisco therefore seems possible, and the accordance of\r\nthe facts with so highly specialized an arrangement is certainly again\r\nindicative of the correctness of the hypothesis of consequent drainage,\r\nand this time in a larger stream than before. At first sight, it\r\nappears that an easier lateral capture might have been made by some of\r\nthe streams flowing from the outer slope of the Nittany highland; but\r\nthis becomes improbable when it is perceived that the heavy Medina\r\nsandstone would here have to be worn through as well as the repeated\r\narches of the Carboniferous beds in the many high folds of the Seven\r\nMountains. Again, as far as present appearances go, we can give no\r\nsufficient reason to explain why possession of the headwaters of the\r\nJuniata was not gained by some subsequent stream of its own, such as G,\r\nfig. 18, instead of by a side-stream of the river in the neighboring\r\nsyncline; but it may be admitted, on the other hand, that as far as we\r\ncan estimate the chances for conquest, there was nothing distinctly in\r\nfavor of one or the other of the side-streams concerned; and as long as\r\nthe problem is solved indifferently in favor of one or the other, we\r\nmay accept the lead of the facts and say that some control not now\r\napparent determined that the diversion should be, as drawn, through D\r\nand not through G. The detailed location of the Juniata in its middle\r\ncourse below Lewistown will be considered in a later section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n30. _Avoidance of the Broad Top basin by the Juniata\r\nheadwaters_.--Another highly characteristic change that the Juniata has\r\nsuffered is revealed by examining the adjustments that would have taken\r\nplace in the general topography of the Broad Top district during the\r\nPerm-Triassic cycle of erosion. When the basin, BT, fig. 22, was first\r\noutlined, centripetal streams descended its slopes from all sides and\r\ntheir waters accumulated as a lake in the center, overflowing to the\r\neast into the subordinate basin, A, in the Juniata syncline along side\r\nof the larger basin, and thence escaping northeast. In due time, the\r\nbreaching of the slopes opened the softer Devonian rocks beneath and\r\nperipheral lowlands were opened on them. The process by which the\r\nJuniata departed from its original axial location, J, fig. 22, to a\r\nparallel course on the southeastern side of the syncline, J, fig. 23,\r\nhas been described (fig. 18). The subsequent changes are manifest. Some\r\nlateral branch of the Juniata, like N, fig. 23, would work its way\r\naround the northern end of the Broad Top canoe on the soft underlying\r\nrocks and capture the axial stream, C, that came from the depression\r\nbetween Nittany and Kishicoquillas highlands; thus reënforced, capture\r\nwould be made of a radial stream from the west, Tn, the existing Tyrone\r\nbranch of the Juniata; in a later stage the other streams of the\r\nwestern side of the basin would be acquired, their divertor\r\nconstituting the Little Juniata of to-day; and the end would be when\r\nthe original Juniata, A, fig. 22, that once issued from the subordinate\r\nsynclinal as a large stream, had lost all its western tributaries, and\r\nwas but a shrunken beheaded remnant of a river, now seen in Aughwick\r\ncreek, A, fig. 24. In the meantime, the former lake basin was fast\r\nbecoming a synclinal mountain of diminishing perimeter. The only really\r\nmysterious courses of the present streams are where the Little Juniata\r\nruns in and out of the western border of the Broad Top synclinal, and\r\nwhere the Frankstown (FT) branch of the Juniata maintains its\r\nindependent gap across Tussey's mountain (Medina), although diverted to\r\nthe Tyrone or main Juniata (Tn) by Warrior's ridge (Oriskany) just\r\nbelow. At the time of the early predatory growth of the initial\r\ndivertor, N, its course lay by the very conditions of its growth on\r\nonly the weakest rocks; but after this little stream had grown to a\r\ngood-sized river, further rising of the land, probably in the time of\r\nthe Jurassic elevation, allowed the river to sink its channel to a\r\ngreater depth, and in doing so, it encountered the hard Medina\r\nanticline of Jack's mountain; here it has since persisted, because, as\r\nwe may suppose, there has been no stream able to divert the course of\r\nso large a river from its crossing of a single hard anticlinal.\r\n\r\nThe doubt that one must feel as to the possibility of the processes\r\njust outlined arises, if I may gauge it by my own feeling, rather from\r\nincredulity than from direct objections. It seems incredible that the\r\nwaste of the valley slopes should allow the backward growth of N at\r\nsuch a rate as to enable it to capture the heads of C, Tn, F, and so\r\non, before they had cut their beds down close enough to the baselevel\r\nof the time to be safe from capture. But it is difficult to urge\r\nexplicit objections against the process or to show its quantitative\r\ninsufficiency. It must be remembered that when these adjustments were\r\ngoing on, the region was one of great altitude, its rocks then had the\r\nsame strong contrasts of strength and weakness that are so apparent in\r\nthe present relief of the surface and the streams concerned were of\r\nmoderate size; less than now, for at the time, the Tyrone, Frankstown\r\nand Bedford head branches of the Juniata had not acquired drainage west\r\nof the great Nittany-Bedford anticlinal axis, but were supplied only by\r\nthe rainfall on its eastern slope (see section 39)--and all these\r\nconditions conspired to favor the adjustment. Finally, while apparently\r\nextraordinary and difficult of demonstration, the explanation if\r\napplicable at all certainly gives rational correlation to a number of\r\npeculiar and special stream courses in the upper Juniata district that\r\nare meaningless under any other theory that has come to my notice. It\r\nis chiefly for this reason that I am inclined to accept the\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n31. _Reversal of larger rivers to southeast courses_.--Our large rivers\r\nat present flow to the southeast, not to the northwest. It is difficult\r\nto find any precise date for this reversal of flow from the initial\r\nhypothetical direction, but it may be suggested that it occurred about\r\nthe time of the Triassic depression of the Newark belt. We have been\r\npersuaded that much time elapsed between the Permian folding and the\r\nNewark deposition, even under the most liberal allowance for\r\npre-Permian erosion in the Newark belt; hence when the depression\r\nbegan, the rivers must have had but moderate northwestward declivity.\r\nThe depression and submergence of the broad Newark belt may at this\r\ntime have broken the continuity of the streams that once flowed across\r\nit. The headwater streams from the ancient Archean country maintained\r\ntheir courses to the depression; the lower portions of the rivers may\r\nalso have gone on as before; but the middle courses were perhaps turned\r\nfrom the central part of the state back of the Newark belt. No change\r\nof attitude gives so fitting a cause of the southeastward flow of our\r\nrivers as this. The only test that I have been able to devise for the\r\nsuggestion is one that is derived from the relation that exists between\r\nthe location of the Newark belt along the Atlantic slope and the course\r\nof the neighboring transverse rivers. In Pennsylvania, where the belt\r\nreaches somewhat beyond the northwestern margin of the crystalline\r\nrocks in South mountain, the streams are reversed, as above stated; but\r\nin the Carolinas where the Newark belt lies far to the east of the\r\nboundary between the Cambrian and crystalline rocks, the Tennessee\r\nstreams persevere in what we suppose to have been their original\r\ndirection of flow. This may be interpreted as meaning that in the\r\nlatter region, the Newark depression was not felt distinctly enough, if\r\nat all, within the Alleghany belt to reverse the flow of the streams;\r\nwhile in the former region, it was nearer to these streams and\r\ndetermined a change in their courses. The original Anthracite river ran\r\nto the northwest, but its middle course was afterwards turned to the\r\nsoutheast.\r\n\r\nI am free to allow that this has the appearance of heaping hypothesis\r\non hypothesis; but in no other way does the analysis of the history of\r\nour streams seem possible, and the success of the experiment can be\r\njudged only after making it. At the same time, I am constrained to\r\nadmit that this is to my own view the least satisfactory of the\r\nsuggestions here presented. It may be correct, but there seems to be no\r\nsufficient exclusion of other possibilities. For example, it must not\r\nbe overlooked that, if the Anthracite river ran southeast during Newark\r\ndeposition, the formation of the Newark northwestward monocline by the\r\nJurassic tilting would have had a tendency to turn the river back again\r\nto its northwest flow. But as the drainage of the region is still\r\nsoutheastward, I am tempted to think that the Jurassic tilting was not\r\nhere strong enough to reverse the flow of so strong and mature a river\r\nas the Anthracite had by that time come to be; and that the elevation\r\nthat accompanied the tilting was not so powerful in reversing the river\r\nto a northwest course as the previous depression of the Newark basin\r\nhad been in turning it to the southeast. If the Anthracite did continue\r\nto flow to the southeast, it may be added that the down-cutting of its\r\nupper branches was greatly retarded by the decrease of slope in its\r\nlower course when the monocline was formed.\r\n\r\nThe only other method of reversing the original northwestward flow of\r\nthe streams that I have imagined is by capture of their headwaters by\r\nAtlantic rivers. This seems to me less effective than the method just\r\nconsidered; but they are not mutually exclusive and the actual result\r\nmay be the sum of the two processes. The outline of the idea is as\r\nfollows. The long continued supply of sedimentary material from the\r\nArchean land on the southeast implies that it was as continually\r\nelevated. But there came a time when there is no record of further\r\nsupply of material, and when we may therefore suppose the elevation was\r\nno longer maintained. From that time onward, the Archean range must\r\nhave dwindled away, what with the encroachment of the Atlantic on its\r\neastern shore and the general action of denuding forces on its surface.\r\nThe Newark depression was an effective aid to the same end, as has been\r\nstated above, and for a moderate distance westward of the depressed\r\nbelt, the former direction of the streams must certainly have been\r\nreversed; but the question remains whether this reversal extended as\r\nfar as the Wyoming basin, and whether the subsequent formation of the\r\nNewark monocline did not undo the effect of the Newark depression. It\r\nis manifest that as far as our limited knowledge goes, it is impossible\r\nto estimate these matters quantitatively, and hence the importance of\r\nlooking for additional processes that may supplement the effect of the\r\nNewark depression and counteract the effect of the Newark uplift in\r\nchanging the course of the rivers. Let it be supposed for the moment\r\nthat at the end of the Jurassic uplift by which the Newark monocline\r\nwas formed, the divide between the Ohio and the Atlantic drainage lay\r\nabout the middle of the Newark belt. There was a long gentle descent\r\nwestward from this watershed and a shorter and hence steeper descent\r\neastward. Under such conditions, the divide must have been pushed\r\nwestward, and as long as the rocks were so exposed as to open areas of\r\nweak sediments on which capture by the Atlantic streams could go on\r\nwith relative rapidity, the westward migration of the divide would be\r\nimportant. For this reason, it might be carried from the Newark belt as\r\nfar as the present Alleghany front, beyond which further pushing would\r\nbe slow, on account of the broad stretch of country there covered by\r\nhard horizontal beds.\r\n\r\nThe end of this is that, under any of the circumstances here detailed,\r\nthere would be early in the Jurassic-Cretaceous cycle a distinct\r\ntendency to a westward migration of the Atlantic-Ohio divide; it is the\r\nconsequences of this that have now to be examined.\r\n\r\n32. _Capture of the Anthracite headwaters by the growing\r\nSusquehanna_.--Throughout the Perm-Triassic period of denudation, a\r\ngreat work was done in wearing down the original Alleghanies.\r\nAnticlines of hard sandstone were breached, and broad lowlands were\r\nopened on the softer rocks beneath. Little semblance of the early\r\nconstructional topography remained when the period of Newark depression\r\nwas brought to a close; and all the while the headwater streams of the\r\nregion were gnawing at the divides, seeking to develop the most perfect\r\narrangement of waterways. Several adjustments have taken place, and the\r\nlarger streams have been reversed in the direction of their flow; but a\r\nmore serious problem is found in the disappearance of the original\r\nmaster stream, the great Anthracite river, which must have at first led\r\naway the water from all the lateral synclinal streams. Being a large\r\nriver, it could not have been easily diverted from its course, unless\r\nit was greatly retarded in cutting down its channel by the presence of\r\nmany beds of hard rocks on its way. The following considerations may\r\nperhaps throw some light on this obscure point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. General distribution of high and low land and\r\ndrainage in early Jurassic time.]\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that the whole group of mountains formed by the\r\nPermian deformation had been reduced to a moderate relief when the\r\nNewark deposition was stopped by the Jurassic elevation. The harder\r\nribs of rock doubtless remained as ridges projecting above the\r\nintervening lowlands, but the strength of relief that had been given by\r\nthe constructional forces had been lost. The general distribution of\r\nresidual elevations then remaining unsubdued is indicated in fig. 25,\r\nin which the Crystalline, the Medina, and the two Carboniferous\r\nsandstone ridges are denoted by appropriate symbols. In restoring this\r\nphase of the surface form, when the country stood lower than now, I\r\nhave reduced the anticlines from their present outlines and increased\r\nthe synclines, the change of area being made greatest where the dips\r\nare least, and hence most apparent at the ends of the plunging\r\nanticlines and synclines. Some of the Medina anticlines of Perry and\r\nJuniata counties are not indicated because they were not then\r\nuncovered. The country between the residual ridges of Jurassic time was\r\nchiefly Cambrian limestone and Siluro-Devonian shales and soft\r\nsandstones. The moderate ridges developed on the Oriskany and Chemung\r\nsandstones are not represented. The drainage of this stage retained the\r\noriginal courses of the streams, except for the adjustments that have\r\nbeen described, but the great Anthracite river is drawn as if it had\r\nbeen controlled by the Newark depression and reversed in the direction\r\nof its flow, so that its former upper course on the Cambrian rocks was\r\nreplaced by a superimposed Newark lower course. Fig. 25 therefore\r\nrepresents the streams for the most part still following near their\r\nsynclinal axes, although departing from them where they have to enter a\r\nsynclinal cove-mountain ridge; the headwaters of the Juniata avoid the\r\nmass of hard sandstones discovered in the bottom of old Broad Top lake,\r\nand flow around them to the north, and then by a cross-country course\r\nto the Wiconisco synclinal, as already described in detail. Several\r\nstreams come from the northeast, entering the Anthracite district after\r\nthe fashion generalized in fig. 13. Three of the many streams that were\r\ndeveloped on the great Kittatinny slope are located, with their\r\ndirection of flow reversed; these are marked Sq, L and D, and are\r\nintended to represent the ancestors of the existing Susquehanna, Lehigh\r\nand Delaware. We have now to examine the opportunities offered to these\r\nsmall streams to increase their drainage areas.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic elevation, by which the Newark deposition was stopped,\r\nrestored to activity all the streams that had in the previous cycle\r\nsought and found a course close to baselevel. They now all set to work\r\nagain deepening their channels. But in this restoration of lost\r\nactivity with reference to a new baselevel, there came the best\r\npossible chance for numerous re-arrangements of drainage areas by\r\nmutual adjustment into which we must inquire.\r\n\r\nI have already illustrated what seems to me to be the type of the\r\nconditions involved at this time in figs. 19 and 20. The master stream,\r\nA, traversing the synclines, corresponds to the reversed Anthracite\r\nriver; the lowlands at the top are those that have been opened out on\r\nthe Siluro-Devonian beds of the present Susquehanna middle course\r\nbetween the Pocono and the Medina ridges. The small stream, B, that is\r\ngaining drainage area in these lowlands, corresponds to the embryo of\r\nthe present Susquehanna, Sq, fig. 25, this having been itself once a\r\nbranch on the south side of the Swatara synclinal stream, fig. 21, from\r\nwhich it was first turned by the change of slope accompanying the\r\nNewark depression; but it is located a little farther west than the\r\nactual Susquehanna, so as to avoid the two synclinal cove mountains of\r\nPocono sandstone that the Susquehanna now traverses, for reasons to be\r\nstated below (section 35). This stream had to cross only one bed of\r\nhard rock, the outer wall of Medina sandstone, between the broad inner\r\nlowlands of the relatively weak Siluro-Devonian rocks and the great\r\nvalley lowlands on the still weaker Cambrian limestones. Step by step\r\nit must have pushed its headwater divide northward, and from time to\r\ntime it would have thus captured a subsequent stream, that crossed the\r\nlowlands eastward, and entered a Carboniferous syncline by one of the\r\nlateral gaps already described. With every such capture, the power of\r\nthe growing stream to capture others was increased. Fig. 19 represents\r\na stage after the streams in the Swatara and Wiconisco synclines (the\r\nlatter then having gained the Juniata) had been turned aside on their\r\nway to the Carboniferous basins. On the other hand, the Anthracite\r\nriver, rising somewhere on the plains north of the Wyoming syncline and\r\npursuing an irregular course from one coal basin to another, found an\r\nextremely difficult task in cutting down its channel across the\r\nnumerous hard beds of the Carboniferous sandstones, so often repeated\r\nin the rolling folds of the coal fields. It is also important to\r\nremember that an aid to other conditions concerned in the diversion of\r\nthe upper Anthracite is found in the decrease of slope that its lower\r\ncourse suffered in crossing the coal fields, if that area took any part\r\nin the deformation that produced the Newark monocline--whichever theory\r\nprove true in regard to the origin of the southeastward flow of the\r\nrivers--for loss of slope in the middle course, where the river had to\r\ncross many reefs of hard sandstone, would have been very effective in\r\nlengthening the time allowed for the diversion of the headwaters.\r\n\r\nThe question is, therefore, whether the retardation of down-cutting\r\nhere experienced by the Anthracite was sufficient to allow the capture\r\nof its headwaters by the Susquehanna. There can be little doubt as to\r\nthe correct quality of the process, but whether it was quantitatively\r\nsufficient is another matter. In the absence of any means of testing\r\nits sufficiency, may the result not be taken as the test? Is not the\r\ncorrespondence between deduction and fact close enough to prove the\r\ncorrectness of the deduction?\r\n\r\n33. _Present outward drainage of the Anthracite basins_.--The Lehigh,\r\nlike the Susquehanna, made an attempt to capture the headwaters of\r\nadjacent streams, but failed to acquire much territory from the\r\nAnthracite because the Carboniferous sandstones spread out between the\r\ntwo in a broad plateau of hard rocks, across which the divide made\r\nlittle movement. The plateau area that its upper branches drain is, I\r\nthink, the conquest of a later cycle of growth. The Delaware had little\r\nsuccess, except as against certain eastern synclinal branches of the\r\nAnthracite, for the same reason. The ancestor of the Swatara of to-day\r\nmade little progress in extending its headwaters because its point of\r\nattack was against the repeated Carboniferous sandstones in the Swatara\r\nsynclinal. One early stream alone found a favorable opportunity for\r\nconquest, and thus grew to be the master river--the Susquehanna of\r\nto-day. The head of the Anthracite was carried away by this captor, and\r\nits beheaded lower portion remains in our Schuylkill. The Anthracite\r\ncoal basins, formerly drained by the single master stream, have since\r\nbeen apportioned to the surrounding rivers. As the Siluro-Devonian\r\nlowlands were opened around the coal-basins, especially on the north\r\nand west, the streams that formerly flowed into the basins were\r\ngradually inverted and flowed out of them, as they still do. The extent\r\nof the inversion seems to be in a general way proportionate to its\r\nopportunity. The most considerable conquests were made in the upper\r\nbasins, where the Catawissa and Nescopec streams of to-day drain many\r\nsquare miles of wide valleys opened on the Mauch Chunk red shale\r\nbetween the Pocono and Pottsville sandstone ridges; the ancient middle\r\nwaters of the Anthracite here being inverted to the Susquehanna\r\ntributaries, because the northern coal basins were degraded very slowly\r\nafter the upper Anthracite had been diverted. The Schuylkill as the\r\nmodern representative of the Anthracite retains only certain streams\r\nsouth of a medial divide between Nescopec and Blue mountains. The only\r\nconsiderable part of the old Anthracite river that still retains a\r\ncourse along the axis of a synclinal trough seems to be that part which\r\nfollows the Wyoming basin; none of the many other coal basins are now\r\noccupied by the large stream that originally followed them. The reason\r\nfor this is manifestly to be found in the great depth of the Wyoming\r\nbasin, whereby the axial portion of its hard sandstones are even now\r\nbelow baselevel, and hence have never yet acted to throw the river from\r\nits axial course. Indeed, during the early cycles of denudation, this\r\nbasin must have been changed from a deep lake to a lacustrine plain by\r\nthe accumulation in it of waste from the surrounding highlands, and for\r\na time the streams that entered it may have flowed in meandering\r\ncourses across the ancient alluvial surface; the lacustrine and\r\nalluvial condition may have been temporarily revived at the time of the\r\nJurassic elevation. It is perhaps as an inheritance from a course thus\r\nlocally superimposed that we may come to regard the deflection of the\r\nriver at Nanticoke from the axis of the syncline to a narrow shale\r\nvalley on its northern side, before turning south again and leaving the\r\nbasin altogether. But like certain other suggestions, this can only be\r\nregarded as an open hypothesis, to be tested by some better method of\r\nriver analysis than we now possess; like several of the other\r\nexplanations here offered, it is presented more as a possibility to be\r\ndiscussed than as a conclusion to be accepted.\r\n\r\nI believe that it was during the earlier part of the great\r\nJura-Cretaceous cycle of denudation that the Susquehanna thus became\r\nthe master stream of the central district of the state. For the rest of\r\nthe cycle, it was occupied in carrying off the waste and reducing the\r\nsurface to a well finished baselevel lowland that characterized the end\r\nof Cretaceous time. From an active youth of conquest, the Susquehanna\r\nadvanced into an old age of established boundaries; and in later times,\r\nits area of drainage does not seem to have been greatly altered from\r\nthat so long ago defined; except perhaps in the districts drained by\r\nthe West and North Branch headwaters.\r\n\r\n34. _Homologies of the Susquehanna and Juniata_.--Looking at the change\r\nfrom the Anthracite to the Susquehanna in a broad way, one may perceive\r\nthat it is an effect of the same order as the peripheral diversion of\r\nthe Broad Top drainage, illustrated in figures 22, 23 and 24; another\r\nexample of a similar change is seen in the lateral diversion of the\r\nJuniata above Lewistown and its rectilinear continuation in Aughwick\r\ncreek, from their original axial location when they formed the initial\r\nBroad Top outlet. They have departed from the axis of their syncline to\r\nthe softer beds on its southern side; FE of fig. 17 has been diverted\r\nto FD of fig. 18.\r\n\r\nAll of these examples are truly only special cases of the one already\r\ndescribed in which the Juniata left its original syncline for others to\r\nthe south. The general case may be stated in a few words. A stream\r\nflowing along a syncline of hard beds (Carboniferous sandstones)\r\ndevelops side streams which breach the adjacent anticlines and open\r\nlowlands in the underlying softer beds (Devonian and Silurian). On\r\nthese lowlands, the headwaters of side streams from other synclines are\r\nencountered and a contest ensues as to possession of the drainage\r\nterritory. The divides are pushed away from those headwaters whose\r\nlower course leads them over the fewest hard barriers; this conquest\r\ngoes on until the upper course of the initial main stream is diverted\r\nto a new and easier path than the one it chose in its youth in\r\nobedience to the first deformation of the region. Thus the Juniata now\r\navoids the center and once deepest part of the old Broad Top lake,\r\nbecause in the general progress of erosion, lowlands on soft Devonian\r\nbeds were opened all around the edge of the great mass of sandstones\r\nthat held the lake; the original drainage across the lake, from its\r\nwestern slopes to its outlet just south of the Jack's mountain\r\nanticline, has now taken an easier path along the Devonian beds to the\r\nwest of the old lake basin, and is seen in the Little Juniata, flowing\r\nalong the outer side of Terrace mountain and rounding the northern\r\nsynclinal point where Terrace mountain joins Sideling hill. It then\r\ncrosses Jack's mountain at a point where the hard Medina sandstones of\r\nthe mountain were still buried at the time of the choice of this\r\nchannel. In the same way, the drainage of the subordinate basin,\r\nthrough which the main lake discharged eastward, is now not along the\r\naxis of the Juniata-Catawissa syncline, but on the softer beds along\r\none side of it; and along the southern side because the easier escape\r\nthat was provided for it lay on that side, namely, via the Tuscarora\r\nand Wiconisco synclines, as already described. The much broader change\r\nfrom the Anthracite to the Susquehanna was only another form of the\r\nsame process. Taking a transverse view of the whole system of central\r\nfolds, it is perceived that their axes descend into the Anthracite\r\ndistrict from the east and rise westward therefrom; it is as if the\r\nwhole region had received a slight transverse folding, and the\r\ntransverse axis of depression thus formed defined the initial course of\r\nthe first master stream. But this master stream deserted its original\r\ncourse on the transverse axis of depression because a lateral course\r\nacross lowlands on softer beds was opened by its side streams; and in\r\nthe contest on these lowlands with an external stream, the Susquehanna,\r\nthe upper portion of the Anthracite was diverted from the hard rocks\r\nthat had appeared on the transverse axis. The distance of diversion\r\nfrom the axial to the lateral course in this case was great because of\r\nthe gentle quality of the transverse folding; or, better said, because\r\nof the gentle dips of the axes of the longitudinal folds. This\r\nappearance of systematic re-arrangement in the several river courses\r\nwhere none was expected is to my mind a strong argument in favor of the\r\noriginally consequent location of the rivers and their later mutual\r\nadjustment. It may perhaps be conceived that antecedent streams might\r\nimitate one another roughly in the attitude that they prophetically\r\nchose with regard to folds subsequently formed, but no reason has been\r\nsuggested for the imitation being carried to so remarkable and definite\r\na degree as that here outlined.\r\n\r\n35. _Superimposition of the Susquehanna on two synclinal\r\nridges_.--There is however one apparently venturesome postulate that\r\nmay have been already noted as such by the reader; unless it can be\r\nreasonably accounted for and shown to be a natural result of the long\r\nsequence of changes here considered, it will seriously militate against\r\nthe validity of the whole argument. The present course of the middle\r\nSusquehanna leads it through the apical curves of two Pocono synclinal\r\nridges, which were disregarded in the statement given above. It was\r\nthen assumed that the embryonic Susquehanna gained possession of the\r\nSiluro-Devonian lowland drainage by gnawing out a course to the west of\r\nthese synclinal points; for it is not to be thought of that any\r\nconquest of the headwaters of the Anthracite river could have been made\r\nby the Susquehanna if it had had to gnaw out the existing four\r\ntraverses of the Pocono sandstones before securing the drainage of the\r\nlowlands above them. The backward progress of the Susquehanna could not\r\nin that case have been nearly fast enough to reach the Anthracite\r\nbefore the latter had sunk its channel to a safe depth. It is therefore\r\nimportant to justify the assumption as to the more westerly location of\r\nthe embryonic Susquehanna; and afterwards, to explain how it should\r\nhave since then been transferred to its present course. A short cut\r\nthrough all this round-about method is open to those who adopt in the\r\nbeginning the theory that the Susquehanna was an antecedent river; but\r\nas I have said at the outset of this inquiry, it seems to me that such\r\na method is not freer from assumption, even though shorter than the one\r\nhere adopted; and it has the demerit of not considering all the curious\r\ndetails that follow the examination of consequent and adjusted courses.\r\n\r\nThe sufficient reason for the assumption that the embryonic Susquehanna\r\nlay farther west than the present one in the neighborhood of the Pocono\r\nsynclinals is simply that--in the absence of any antecedent stream--it\r\nmust have lain there. The whole explanation of the development of the\r\nSiluro-Devonian lowlands between the Pocono and Medina ridges depends\r\nsimply on their being weathered out where the rocks are weak enough to\r\nwaste faster than the enclosing harder ridges through which the streams\r\nescape. In this process, the streams exercise no control whatever over\r\nthe direction in which their headwaters shall grow; they leave this\r\nentirely to the structure of the district that they drain. It thus\r\nappears that, under the postulate as to the initial location of the\r\nSusquehanna as one of the many streams descending the great slope of\r\nthe Kittatinny (Cumberland) highland into the Swatara syncline, its\r\ncourse being reversed from northward to southward by the Newark\r\ndepression, we are required to suppose that its headwater (northward)\r\ngrowth at the time of the Jurassic elevation must have been on the\r\nSiluro-Devonian beds, so as to avoid the harder rocks on either side.\r\nMany streams competed for the distinction of becoming the master, and\r\nthat one gained its ambition whose initial location gave it the best\r\nsubsequent opportunity. It remains then to consider the means by which\r\nthe course of the conquering Susquehanna may have been subsequently\r\nchanged from the lowlands on to the two Pocono synclines that it now\r\ntraverses. Some departure from its early location may have been due to\r\neastward planation in its advanced age, when it had large volume and\r\ngentle slope and was therefore swinging and cutting laterally in its\r\nlower course. This may have had a share in the result, but there is\r\nanother process that seems to me more effective.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the Jura-Cretaceous cycle, the whole country\r\nhereabout suffered a moderate depression, by which the Atlantic\r\ntransgressed many miles inland from its former shoreline, across the\r\nlowlands of erosion that had been developed on the litoral belt. Such a\r\ndepression must have had a distinct effect on the lower courses of the\r\nlarger rivers, which having already cut their channels down close to\r\nbaselevel and opened their valleys wide on the softer rocks, were then\r\n\"estuaried,\" or at least so far checked as to build wide flood-plains\r\nover their lower stretches. Indeed, the flood-plains may have been\r\nbegun at an earlier date, and have been confirmed and extended in the\r\nlater time of depression. Is it possible that in the latest stage of\r\nthis process, the almost baselevelled remnants of Blue mountain and the\r\nPocono ridges could have been buried under the flood-plain in the\r\nneighborhood of the river?\r\n\r\nIf this be admitted, it is then natural for the river to depart from\r\nthe line of its buried channel and cross the buried ridges on which it\r\nmight settle down as a superimposed river in the next cycle of\r\nelevation. It is difficult to decide such general questions as these;\r\nand it may be difficult for the reader to gain much confidence in the\r\nefficacy of the processes suggested; but there are certain features in\r\nthe side streams of the Susquehanna that lend some color of probability\r\nto the explanation as offered.\r\n\r\nAdmit, for the moment, that the aged Susquehanna, in the later part of\r\nthe Jura-Cretaceous cycle, did change its channel somewhat by cutting\r\nto one side, or by planation, as it is called. Admit, also, that in the\r\nnatural progress of its growth it had built a broad flood plain over\r\nthe Siluro-Devonian lowlands, and that the depth of this deposit was\r\nincreased by the formation of an estuarine delta upon it when the\r\ncountry sank at the time of the mid-Cretaceous transgression of the\r\nsea. It is manifest that one of the consequences of all this might be\r\nthe peculiar course of the river that is to be explained, namely, its\r\nsuperimposition on the two Pocono synclinal ridges in the next cycle of\r\nits history, after the Tertiary elevation had given it opportunity to\r\nre-discover them. It remains to inquire what other consequences should\r\nfollow from the same conditions, and from these to devise tests of the\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n36. _Evidence of superimposition in the Susquehanna tributaries_.--One\r\nof the peculiarities of flood-plained rivers is that the lateral\r\nstreams shift their points of union with the main stream farther and\r\nfarther down the valley, as Lombardini has shown in the case of the Po.\r\nIf the Susquehanna were heavily flood-plained at the close of the\r\nJura-Cretaceous cycle, some of its tributaries should manifest signs of\r\nthis kind of deflection from their structural courses along the strike\r\nof the rocks. Side streams that once joined the main stream on the line\r\nof some of the softer northeast-southwest beds, leaving the stronger\r\nbeds as faint hills on either side, must have forgotten such control\r\nafter it was baselevelled and buried; as the flood plain grew, they\r\nproperly took more and more distinctly downward deflected courses, and\r\nthese deflections should be maintained in subsequent cycles as\r\nsuperimposed courses independent of structural guidance. Such I believe\r\nto be the fact. The downstream deflection is so distinctly a\r\npeculiarity of a number of tributaries that join the Susquehanna on the\r\nwest side (see figure 1) that it cannot be ascribed to accident, but\r\nmust be referred to some systematic cause. Examples of deflection are\r\nfound in Penn's creek, Middle creek and North Mahantango creek in\r\nSnyder county; West Mahantango between the latter and Juniata county;\r\nand in the Juniata and Little Juniata rivers of Perry county. On the\r\nother side of the Susquehanna, the examples are not so distinct, but\r\nthe following may be mentioned: Delaware and Warrior runs,\r\nChillisquaque creek and Little Shamokin creek, all in Northumberland\r\ncounty. It may be remarked that it does not seem impossible that the\r\nreason for the more distinct deflection of the western streams may be\r\nthat the Susquehanna is at present east of its old course, and hence\r\ntowards the eastern margin of its flood plain, as, indeed its position\r\non the Pocono synclinals implies. A reason for the final location of\r\nthe superimposed river on the eastern side of the old flood plain may\r\nperhaps be found in the eastward tilting that is known to have\r\naccompanied the elevation of the Cretaceous lowland.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the foregoing that the present lower course of the\r\nSusquehanna must also be of superimposed origin; for the flood plain of\r\nthe middle course must have extended down stream to its delta, and\r\nthere have become confluent with the sheet of Cretaceous sediments that\r\ncovered all the southeastern lowland, over which the sea had\r\ntransgressed. McGee has already pointed out indications of superimposed\r\nstream courses in the southeastern part of the State;[22] but I am not\r\nsure that he would regard them as of the date here referred to.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Amer. Journ. Science, xxxv, 1888, 121, 134.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of the location of the Susquehanna on the Pocono synclinal\r\nridges therefore stands as follows. The general position of the river\r\nindicates that it has been located by some process of slow\r\nself-adjusting development and that it is not a persistent antecedent\r\nriver; and yet there is no reason to think that it could have been\r\nbrought into its present special position by any process of shifting\r\ndivides. The processes that have been suggested to account for its\r\nspecial location, as departing slightly from a location due to slow\r\nadjustments following an ancient consequent origin, call for the\r\noccurrence of certain additional peculiarities in the courses of its\r\ntributary streams, entirely unforeseen and unnoticed until this point\r\nin the inquiry is reached; and on looking at the map to see if they\r\noccur, they are found with perfect distinctness. The hypothesis of\r\nsuperimposition may therefore be regarded as having advanced beyond the\r\nstage of mere suggestion and as having gained some degree of\r\nconfirmation from the correlations that it detects and explains. It\r\nonly remains to ask if these correlations might have originated in any\r\nother way, and if the answer to this is in the negative, the case may\r\nbe looked upon as having a fair measure of evidence in its favor. The\r\nremaining consideration may be taken up at once as the first point to\r\nbe examined in the Tertiary cycle of development.\r\n\r\n37. _Events of the Tertiary cycle_.--The elevation given to the region\r\nby which Cretaceous baselevelling was terminated, and which I have\r\ncalled the early Tertiary elevation, offered opportunity for the\r\nstreams to deepen their channels once more. In doing so, certain\r\nadjustments of moderate amount occurred, which will be soon examined.\r\nAs time went on, much denudation was effected, but no wide-spread\r\nbaselevelling was reached, for the Cretaceous crest lines of the hard\r\nsandstone ridges still exist. The Tertiary cycle was an incomplete one.\r\nAt its close, lowlands had been opened only on the weaker rocks between\r\nthe hard beds. Is it not possible that the flood-plaining of the\r\nSusquehanna and the down-stream deflection of its branches took place\r\nin the closing stages of this cycle, instead of at the end of the\r\nprevious cycle? If so, the deflection might appear on the branches, but\r\nthe main river would not be transferred to the Pocono ridges. This\r\nquestion may be safely answered in the negative; for the Tertiary\r\nlowland is by no means well enough baselevelled to permit such an\r\nevent. The beds of intermediate resistance, the Oriskany and certain\r\nChemung sandstones, had not been worn down to baselevel at the close of\r\nthe Tertiary cycle; they had indeed lost much of the height that they\r\npossessed at the close of the previous cycle, but they had not been\r\nreduced as low as the softer beds on either side. They were only\r\nreduced to ridges of moderate and unequal height over the general plain\r\nof the Siluro-Devonian low country, without great strength of relief\r\nbut quite strong enough to call for obedience from the streams along\r\nside of them. And yet near Selin's Grove, for example, in Snyder\r\ncounty, Penn's and Middle creeks depart most distinctly from the strike\r\nof the local rocks as they near the Susquehanna, and traverse certain\r\nwell-marked ridges on their way to the main river. Such aberrant\r\nstreams cannot be regarded as superimposed at the close of the\r\nincomplete Tertiary cycle; they cannot be explained by any process of\r\nspontaneous adjustment yet described, nor can they be regarded as\r\nvastly ancient streams of antecedent courses; I am therefore much\r\ntempted to consider them as of superimposed origin, inheriting their\r\npresent courses from the flood-plain cover of the Susquehanna in the\r\nlatest stage of the Jura-Cretaceous cycle. With this tentative\r\nconclusion in mind as to the final events of Jura-Cretaceous time, we\r\nmay take up the more deliberate consideration of the work of the\r\nTertiary cycle.\r\n\r\nThe chief work of the Tertiary cycle was merely the opening of the\r\nvalley lowlands; little opportunity for river adjustment occurred\r\nexcept on a small scale. The most evident cases of adjustment have\r\nresulted in the change of water-gaps into wind-gaps, of which several\r\nexamples can be given, the one best known being the Delaware wind-gap\r\nbetween the Lehigh and Delaware water-gaps in Blue mountain. The\r\nwind-gap marks the unfinished notch of some stream that once crossed\r\nthe ridge here and whose headwaters have since then been diverted,\r\nprobably to the Lehigh. The difficulty in the case is not at all how\r\nthe stream that once flowed here was diverted, but how a stream that\r\ncould be diverted in the Tertiary cycle could have escaped diversion at\r\nsome earlier date. The relative rarity of wind-gaps indicates that\r\nnearly all of the initial lateral streams, which may have crossed the\r\nridges at an early epoch in the history of the rivers, have been\r\nbeheaded in some cycle earlier than the Tertiary and their gaps\r\nthereafter obliterated. Why the Delaware wind-gap stream should have\r\nendured into a later cycle does not at present appear. Other wind-gaps\r\nof apparently similar origin may be found in Blue mountain west of the\r\nSchuylkill and east of the Susquehanna. It is noteworthy that if any\r\nsmall streams still persevere in their gaps across a hard ridge, they\r\nare not very close to any large river-gap; hence it is only at the very\r\nheadwaters of Conedogwinet creek, in the northern part of Franklin\r\ncounty, that any water is still drawn from the back of Blue mountain.\r\nAgain, these small stream gaps do not lie between large river-gaps and\r\nwind-gaps, but wind-gaps lie between the gaps of large rivers and those\r\nof small streams that are not yet diverted. Excellent illustration of\r\nthis is found on the \"Piedmont sheet\" of the contoured maps issued by\r\nthe United States Geological Survey. The sheet covers part of Maryland\r\nand West Virginia, near where the North Branch of the Potomac comes out\r\nof the plateau and crosses New Creek mountain. Eleven miles south of\r\nthe Potomac gap there is a deep wind-gap; but further on, at twenty,\r\ntwenty-five and twenty-nine miles from the river-gap are three fine\r\nwater-gaps occupied by small streams. This example merely shows how\r\nmany important points in the history of our rivers will be made clear\r\nwhen the country is properly portrayed on contoured maps.\r\n\r\nA few lines may be given to the general absence of gaps in Blue\r\nMountain in Pennsylvania. When the initial consequent drainage was\r\nestablished, many streams must have been located on the northward slope\r\nof the great Cumberland highland, C, C, fig. 21; they must have gullied\r\nthe slope to great depths and carried away great volumes of the weak\r\nCambrian beds that lay deep within the hard outer casings of the mass.\r\nMinor adjustments served to diminish the number of these streams, but\r\nthe more effective cause of their present rarity lay in the natural\r\nselection of certain of them to become large streams; the smaller ones\r\nwere generally beheaded by these. The only examples of streams that\r\nstill cross this ridge with their initial Permian direction of flow to\r\nthe northwest are found in two southern branches of Tuscarora creek at\r\nthe southern point of Juniata county; and these survive because of\r\ntheir obscure location among the many Medina ridges of that district,\r\nwhere they were not easily accessible to capture by other streams.\r\n\r\n38. _Tertiary adjustment of the Juniata on the Medina anticlines_.--The\r\nlower course of the Juniata presents several examples of adjustment\r\nreferable to the last part of the Jura-Cretaceous cycle and to the\r\nTertiary cycle. The explanation offered for the escape of this river\r\nfrom its initial syncline did not show any reason for its peculiar\r\nposition with respect to the several Medina anticlines that it now\r\nborders, because at the time when it was led across country to the\r\nWiconisco syncline, the hard Medina beds of these anticlines were not\r\ndiscovered. It is therefore hardly to be thought that the location of\r\nthe Juniata in the Narrows below Lewistown between Blue Ridge and Shade\r\nmountain and its avoidance of Tuscarora mountain could have been\r\ndefined at that early date. But all these Medina anticlines rise more\r\nor less above the Cretaceous baselevel, and must have had some effect\r\non the position taken by the river about the middle of that cycle when\r\nits channel sank upon them. Blue Ridge and Black Log anticlines rise\r\nhighest. The first location of the cross-country stream that led the\r\nearly Juniata away from its initial syncline probably traversed the\r\nBlue Ridge and Black Log anticlines while they were yet buried; but its\r\nchannel-cutting was much retarded on encountering them, and some branch\r\nstream working around from the lower side of the obstructions may have\r\ndiverted the river to an easier path. The only path of the kind is the\r\nnarrow one between the overlapping anticlines of Blue Ridge and Shade\r\nmountains, and there the Juniata now flows. If another elevation should\r\noccur in the future, it might happen that the slow deepening of the\r\nchannel in the hard Medina beds which now floor the Narrows would allow\r\nMiddle creek of Snyder county to tap the Juniata at Lewistown and lead\r\nit by direct course past Middleburgh to the Susquehanna; thus it would\r\nreturn to the path of its youth.\r\n\r\nThe location of the Juniata at the end of Tuscarora mountain is again\r\nso definite that it can hardly be referred to a time when the mountain\r\nhad not been revealed. The most likely position of the original\r\ncross-country stream which brought the Juniata into the Wiconisco\r\nsyncline was somewhere on the line of the existing mountain, and\r\nassuming it to have been there, we must question how it has been\r\ndisplaced. The process seems to have been of the same kind as that just\r\ngiven; the retardation of channel-cutting in the late Cretaceous cycle,\r\nwhen the Medina beds of Tuscarora anticline were discovered, allowed a\r\nbranch from the lower part of the river to work around the end of the\r\nmountain and lead the river out that way. The occurrence of a shallow\r\ndepression across the summit of the otherwise remarkably even crest of\r\nTuscarora mountain suggests that this diversion was not finally\r\naccomplished until shortly after the Tertiary elevation of the country;\r\nbut at whatever date the adjustment occurred, it is natural that it\r\nshould pass around the eastern end of the mountain and not around the\r\nwestern end, where the course would have been much longer, and\r\ntherefore not successfully to be taken by a diverting stream.\r\n\r\nWhile the quality of these processes appears satisfactory, I am not\r\nsatisfied as to the sufficiency of their quantity. If diversion was\r\nsuccessfully practiced at the crossing of the Tuscarora anticline, why\r\nnot also at the crossing of Jack's mountain anticline, on which the\r\nriver still perseveres. It is difficult here to decide how much\r\nconfidence may be placed in the explanation, because of its giving\r\nreason for the location of certain streams, and how much doubt must be\r\ncast upon it, because it seems impossible and is not of universal\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n39. _Migration of the Atlantic-Ohio divide_.--There are certain shifted\r\ncourses which cannot be definitely referred to any particular cycle,\r\nand which may therefore be mentioned now. Among the greatest are those\r\nby which the divide between the Atlantic and the Ohio streams has been\r\nchanged from its initial position on the great constructional Nittany\r\nhighland and Bedford range. There was probably no significant change\r\nuntil after Newark depression, for the branches of the Anthracite river\r\ncould not have begun to push the divide westward till after the\r\neastward flow of the river was determined; until then, there does not\r\nseem to have been any marked advantage possessed by the eastward\r\nstreams over the westward. But with the eastward escape of the\r\nAnthracite, it probably found a shorter course to the sea and one that\r\nled it over alternately soft and hard rocks, instead of the longer\r\ncourse followed by the Ohio streams over continuous sandstones. The\r\nadvantage given by the greater extent of soft beds is indicated by the\r\ngreat breadth of the existing valleys in the central district compared\r\nwith the less breadth of those in the plateau to the west. Consider the\r\neffect of this advantage at the time of the Jurassic elevation. As the\r\nstreams on the eastern slope of the Nittany divide had the shortest and\r\nsteepest courses to the sea, they deepened their valleys faster than\r\nthose on the west and acquired drainage area from them; hence we find\r\nreason for the drainage of the entire Nittany and Bedford district by\r\nthe Atlantic streams at present. Various branches of what are now the\r\nAlleghany and Monongahela originally rose on the western slope of the\r\ndividing range. These probably reached much farther east in pre-Permian\r\ntime, but had their headwaters turned another way by the growth of the\r\ngreat anticlinal divide; but the smaller anticlines of Laurel ridge and\r\nNegro mountain farther west do not seem to have been strong enough to\r\nform a divide, for the rivers still traverse them. Now as the\r\nheadwaters of the Juniata breached the eastern slope of the\r\nNittany-Bedford range and pushed the divide westward, they at last\r\ngained possession of the Siluro-Devonian monocline on its western\r\nslope; but beyond this it has not been possible for them yet to go. As\r\nthe streams cut down deeper and encountered the Medina anticline near\r\nthe core of the ridge, they sawed a passage through it; the Cambrian\r\nbeds were discovered below and a valley was opened on them as the\r\nMedina cover wore away. The most important point about this is that we\r\nfind in it an adequate explanation of the opposite location of\r\nwater-gaps in pairs, such as characterize the branches of the Juniata\r\nbelow Tyrone and again below Bedford. This opposite location has been\r\nheld to indicate an antecedent origin of the river that passes through\r\nthe gaps, while gaps formed by self-developed streams are not thought\r\nto present such correspondence (Hilber). Yet this special case of\r\npaired gaps in the opposite walls of a breached anticline is manifestly\r\na direct sequence of the development of the Juniata headwaters. The\r\nsettling down of the main Juniata on Jack's mountain anticline below\r\nHuntingdon is another case of the same kind, in which the relatively\r\nlow anticlinal crest is as yet not widely breached; the gaps below\r\nBedford stand apart, as the crest is there higher, and hence wider\r\nopened; and the gaps below Tyrone are separated by some ten or twelve\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWhen the headwater streams captured the drainage of the Siluro-Devonian\r\nmonocline on the western side of the ancient dividing anticline, they\r\ndeveloped subsequent rectangular branches growing like a well-trained\r\ngrape vine. Most of this valley has been acquired by the west branch of\r\nthe Susquehanna, probably because it traversed the Medina beds less\r\noften than the Juniata. For the same reason, it may be, the West Branch\r\nhas captured a considerable area of plateau drainage that must have\r\nonce belonged to the Ohio, while the Juniata has none of it; but if so,\r\nthe capture must have been before the Tertiary cycle, for since that\r\ntime the ability of the West Branch and of the Juniata as regards such\r\ncapture appears about alike. On the other hand, Castleman's river, a\r\nbranch of the Monongahela, still retains the drainage of a small bit of\r\nthe Siluro-Devonian monocline, at the southern border of the State,\r\nwhere the Juniata headwaters had the least opportunity to capture it;\r\nbut the change here is probably only retarded, not prevented entirely;\r\nthe Juniata will some day push the divide even here back to the\r\nAlleghany Front, the frontal bluff of the plateau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n40. _Other examples of adjustments_.--Other examples of small\r\nadjustments are found around the Wyoming basin, fig. 26. Originally all\r\nthese streams ran centripetally down the enclosing slopes, and in such\r\nlocations they must have cut gullies and breaches in the hard\r\nCarboniferous beds and opened low back country on the weaker Devonians.\r\nSome of the existing streams still do so, and these are precisely the\r\nones that are not easily reached by divertors. The Susquehanna in its\r\ncourse outside of the basin has sent out branches that have beheaded\r\nall the centripetal streams within reach; where the same river enters\r\nthe basin, the centripetal streams have been shortened if not\r\ncompletely beheaded. A branch of the Delaware has captured the heads of\r\nsome of the streams near the eastern end of the basin. Elsewhere, the\r\ncentripetal streams still exist of good length. The contrast between\r\nthe persistence of some of the centripetal streams here and their\r\nperipheral diversion around Broad Top is a consequence of the\r\ndifference of altitude of the old lake bottoms in the two cases. It is\r\nnot to be doubted that we shall become acquainted with many examples of\r\nthis kind as our intimacy with rivers increases.\r\n\r\n41. _Events of the Quaternary cycle_.--The brief quaternary cycle does\r\nnot offer many examples of the kind that we have considered, and all\r\nthat are found are of small dimensions. The only capturing stream that\r\nneed be mentioned has lately been described as a \"river pirate;\"[23]\r\nbut its conquest is only a Schleswig-Holstein affair compared to the\r\nGoth- and Hun-like depredations of the greater streams in earlier\r\ncycles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Science, xiii, 1889, 108.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the streams and their valleys as they now exist is\r\nstrikingly dependent in many ways on the relation of the incipient\r\nquaternary cycle to the longer cycles of the past. No lakes occur,\r\nexception being made only of the relatively small ponds due to drift\r\nobstruction within the glaciated area. Waterfalls are found only at the\r\nheadwaters of small streams in the plateau district, exception again\r\nbeing made only for certain cases of larger streams that have been\r\nthrown from their pre-glacial courses by drift barriers, and which are\r\nnow in a very immature state on their new lines of flow. The small\r\nvalleys of this cycle are shallow and narrow, always of a size strictly\r\nproportional to the volume of the stream and the hardness of the\r\nenclosing rocks, exception being made only in the case of post-glacial\r\ngorges whose streams have been displaced from their pre-glacial\r\nchannels. The terraces that are seen, especially on the streams that\r\nflow in or from the glaciated district, are merely a temporary and\r\nsubordinate complication of the general development of the valleys. In\r\nthe region that has been here considered, the streams have been seldom\r\nmuch displaced from their pre-glacial channels; but in the northwestern\r\npart of the State, where the drift in the valleys seems to be heavier,\r\nmore serious disturbance of pre-glacial courses is reported. The facts\r\nhere referred to in regard to lakes, falls, gorges, terraces and\r\ndisplaced streams are to be found in the various volumes of the Second\r\nGeological Survey of the State;[24] in regard to the terraces and the\r\nestuarine deflections of the Delaware and Susquehanna, reference should\r\nbe made also to McGee's studies.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Especially Carll, Reports I_{3}, I_{4}; White, Reports\r\nG_{5}, G_{6}; Lewis, Report Z.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Amer. Journ. Science, xxxv, 1888, 367, 448; Seventh\r\nAnnual Rep. U. S. G. S., 1888, 545.]\r\n\r\n42. _Doubtful cases_.--It is hardly necessary to state that there are\r\nmany facts for which no satisfactory explanation is found under the\r\ntheory of adjustments that we have been considering. Some will\r\ncertainly include the location of the Susquehanna on the points of the\r\nPocono synclines under this category; all must feel that such a\r\nlocation savors of an antecedent origin. The same is true of the\r\nexamples of the alignment of water-gaps found on certain streams; for\r\nexample, the four gaps cut in the two pairs of Pocono and Pottsville\r\noutcrops at the west end of the Wyoming syncline, and the three gaps\r\nwhere the Little Schuylkill crosses the coal basin at Tamaqua; the\r\nopposite gaps in pairs at Tyrone and Bedford have already been\r\nsufficiently explained. The location of the upper North Branch of the\r\nSusquehanna is also unrelated to processes of adjustment as far as I\r\ncan see them, and the great area of plateau drainage that is now\r\npossessed by the West Branch is certainly difficult to understand as\r\nthe result of conquest. The two independent gaps in Tussey's mountain,\r\nmaintained by the Juniata and its Frankstown branch below Tyrone are\r\ncurious, especially in view of the apparent diversion of the branch to\r\nthe main stream on the upper side of Warrior's ridge (Oriskany), just\r\neast of Tussey's mountain.\r\n\r\n43. _Complicated history of our actual rivers_.--If this theory of the\r\nhistory of our rivers is correct, it follows that any one river as it\r\nnow exists is of so complicated an origin that its development cannot\r\nbecome a matter of general study and must unhappily remain only a\r\nsubject for special investigation for some time to come. It was my hope\r\non beginning this essay to find some teachable sequence of facts that\r\nwould serve to relieve the usual routine of statistical and descriptive\r\ngeography, but this is not the result that has been attained. The\r\nhistory of the Susquehanna, the Juniata, or the Schuylkill, is too\r\ninvolved with complex changes, if not enshrouded in mystery, to become\r\nintelligible to any but advanced students; only the simplest cases of\r\nriver development can be introduced into the narrow limits of ordinary\r\ninstruction. The single course of an ancient stream is now broken into\r\nseveral independent parts; witness the disjointing and diversion of the\r\noriginal Juniata, which, as I have supposed, once extended from Broad\r\nTop lake to the Catawissa basin. Now the upper part of the stream,\r\nrepresenting the early Broad Top outlet, is reduced to small volume in\r\nAughwick creek; the continuation of the stream to Lewistown is first\r\nset to one side of its original axial location and is then diverted to\r\nanother syncline; the beheaded portion now represented by Middle creek\r\nis diverted from its course to the Catawissa basin by the Susquehanna;\r\nperhaps the Catawissa of the present day represents the reversed course\r\nof the lower Juniata where it joined the Anthracite. This unserviceably\r\ncomplicated statement is not much simplified if instead of beginning\r\nwith an original stream and searching out its present disjointed parts,\r\nwe trace the composition of a single existing stream from its once\r\nindependent parts. The Juniata of to-day consists of headwaters\r\nacquired from Ohio streams; the lake in which the river once gathered\r\nits upper branches is now drained and the lake bottom has become a\r\nmountain top; the streams flow around the margin of the lake, not\r\nacross its basin; a short course towards Lewistown nearly coincides\r\nwith the original location of the stream, but to confound this with a\r\nprecise agreement is to lose the true significance of river history;\r\nthe lower course is the product of diversion at least at two epochs and\r\ncertainly in several places; and where the river now joins the\r\nSusquehanna, it is suspected of having a superimposed course unlike any\r\nof the rest of the stream. This is too complicated, even if it should\r\never be demonstrated to be wholly true, to serve as material for\r\nordinary study; but as long as it has a savor of truth, and as long as\r\nwe are ignorant of the whole history of our rivers, through which alone\r\ntheir present features can be rightfully understood, we must continue\r\nto search after the natural processes of their development as carefully\r\nand thoroughly as the biologist searches for the links missing from his\r\nscheme of classification.\r\n\r\n44. _Provisional Conclusions_.--It is in view of these doubts and\r\ncomplications that I feel that the history of our rivers is not yet\r\nsettled; but yet the numerous accordances of actual and deductive\r\nlocations appear so definite and in some cases so remarkable that they\r\ncannot be neglected, as they must be if we should adhere to the\r\nantecedent origin of the river courses.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted on an early page therefore seems to be justified.\r\nThe provisional system of ancient consequent drainage, illustrated on\r\nfig. 21, does appear to be sufficiently related to the streams of\r\nto-day to warrant the belief that most of our rivers took their first\r\ncourses between the primitive folds of our mountains, and that from\r\nthat distant time to the present the changes they have suffered are due\r\nto their own interaction--to their own mutual adjustment more than to\r\nany other cause. The Susquehanna, Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware are\r\ncompound, composite and highly complex rivers, of repeated mature\r\nadjustment. The middle Susquehanna and its branches and the upper\r\nportions of the Schuylkill and Lehigh are descendants of original\r\nPermian rivers consequent on the constructional topography of that\r\ntime; Newark depression reversed the flow of some of the transverse\r\nstreams, and the spontaneous changes or adjustments from immature to\r\nmature courses in the several cycles of development are so numerous and\r\nextensive that, as Löwl truly says, the initial drainage has almost\r\ndisappeared. The larger westward-flowing streams of the plateau are of\r\nearlier, Carboniferous birth, and have suffered little subsequent\r\nchange beyond a loss of headwaters. The lower courses of the Atlantic\r\nrivers are younger, having been much shifted from their Permian or\r\npre-Permian courses by Newark and Cretaceous superimposition, as well\r\nas by recent downward deformation of the surface in their existing\r\nestuaries. No recognizable remnant of rivers antecedent to the Permian\r\ndeformation are found in the central part of the State; and with the\r\nexception of parts of the upper Schuylkill and of the Susquehanna near\r\nWilkes-Barre, there are no large survivors of Permian consequent\r\nstreams in the ordinary meaning of the term \"consequent.\" The shifting\r\nof courses in the progress of mature adjustment has had more to do with\r\ndetermining the actual location of our rivers and streams than any\r\nother process.\r\n\r\n  Harvard College, June, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHIC MODELS.\r\n\r\nBY COSMOS MINDELEFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many methods by which it has been sought to represent the relief\r\nof a country or district, only two have been at all widely used. These\r\nmethods are, in the order of their development, by hachured and by\r\ncontoured maps. Both have advantages and both have serious\r\ndisadvantages. Without entering into the controversy that is even yet\r\nraging over the relative merits of the two systems, some slight notice\r\nof what each claims to accomplish is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe representation of relief by hachures is a graphic system, and in\r\nthe best examples we have is an attempt to show, upon a plane surface,\r\nthe actual appearance of a given area under given conditions of\r\nlighting,--as in the Dufour map of the Alps. Of course certain details\r\nthat would really disappear if the assumed conditions were actual ones,\r\nmust be shown upon the map,--so that it is, after all, but a\r\nconventional representation. The very best examples are, for this and\r\nother reasons, unsatisfactory, and far more so is this the case in the\r\nvastly larger class of medium grade and poor work.\r\n\r\nThe contour system represents relief by a series of lines, each of\r\nwhich is, at every point throughout its length, at a certain stated\r\nelevation above sea-level, or some other datum-plane; in other words,\r\neach contour line represents what would be the water's edge, if the sea\r\nwere to rise to that elevation. It possesses the advantage of great\r\nclearness, but fails to a large degree in the representation of surface\r\ndetail; moreover, one must have considerable knowledge of topography,\r\nin order to read the map correctly.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For specimens of representation of the same subject on\r\ndifferent scales, in both the hachure and contour systems, see plate\r\nfrom \"Enthoffer's Topographical Atlas.\"]\r\n\r\nTo those who must give first place to the quantity of relief rather\r\nthan the quality, as, for example, the geologist or the engineer, a\r\ncontoured map is now considered essential. On the other hand, where\r\nquality of relief is the prime consideration and the quantity a\r\nsecondary one, as, for example, for the use of the army, a hachured map\r\nis considered the best. The method of hachures may be roughly\r\ncharacterized as a graphic system with a conventional element, and the\r\ncontour method as a conventional system with a graphic element,--for if\r\nthe contour interval is small enough a sort of shading is produced\r\nwhich helps considerably the idea of relief.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two great systems, with which everyone is more or\r\nless familiar, there is another method of representing a country or\r\ndistrict,--a method that succeeds where others fail, and which although\r\nby no means new, has not received the attention it deserves: this is\r\nthe representation of a country by a model in relief. Certain striking\r\nadvantages of models over maps of all kinds are, indeed, so apparent\r\nthat one almost loses sight of such slight disadvantages as can, of\r\ncourse, be urged against them. In the graphic representation of the\r\nsurface they are far superior to the hachured map, and they have the\r\nfurther advantage of expressing the relative relief, which the hachured\r\nmap fails to do, except in a very general way. They have also the\r\nadvantage of showing actual shadows, exactly as they would be seen in a\r\nbird's-eye view of the district, instead of more or less conventional\r\nones, and are, consequently, more easily comprehended by the layman,\r\nwithout becoming any less valuable to the skilled topographer. In\r\nshort, they combine all the graphic features of a hachured map with all\r\nthe advantages of the best class of contoured maps, and in addition\r\nthey show more of the surface detail, upon which so much of the\r\ncharacter of the country depends and which is very inadequately\r\nexpressed by hachures and almost completely ignored in a contoured map\r\nof large interval. The contours themselves can be made to appear upon\r\nthe model very easily and without interfering with other features.\r\n\r\nThe uses of models are many and various. Within the past few years\r\ntheir usefulness has been much extended, and, now that they are\r\nbecoming better known, will probably receive a still further extension.\r\nTo the geologist they are often of great value in working out the\r\nstructure of complicated districts, for the reason that so many\r\nimportant structural relations can be presented to the eye at a single\r\nglance. Similarly, for the graphic presentation of results there is no\r\nbetter method, as the topography, the surface geology, and any number\r\nof sections can be shown together and seen in their proper\r\nrelationship. To the engineer an accurate model is often of the\r\ngreatest assistance in working out his problems, and it is simply\r\ninvaluable to explain the details of a plan to anyone who has little or\r\nno technical training; for, as has been stated, a model is easily\r\ncomprehended by anyone, while more or less technical knowledge is\r\nrequired for the proper understanding of even the best maps.\r\n\r\nI might go on cataloguing in detail the many uses to which models may\r\nbe put, but shall now mention only one more--perhaps the most important\r\nof all--their use in the education of the young. No method has yet been\r\ndevised that is capable of giving so clear and accurate a conception of\r\nthe principles of physical geography as a series of well selected\r\nmodels; models have, indeed, already been used for this purpose, but\r\nunfortunately their great cost has prevented their general use in\r\nschools. Since, however, the study of geography has been placed upon a\r\nnew basis and a new life has been infused into it, many men have given\r\ntheir attention to the subject of models, and have experimented with a\r\nview to cheapen the cost of reproduction, which has hitherto prevented\r\ntheir wide distribution; and probably this objection will soon be\r\nremedied. The ability to read a map correctly,--to obtain from a study\r\nof the map a clear conception of the country represented,--is more\r\nuncommon than is usually supposed. Some of the recent methods of\r\nteaching geography are intended to cultivate this very faculty, but it\r\nis doubtful whether there is any better method than that which consists\r\nin the study of a series of good models in conjunction with a series of\r\nmaps, all on the same scale and of the same areas. The value of a\r\nseries of good models in teaching geology is so apparent that it need\r\nonly be mentioned. It is often, for reasons stated above, far more\r\nvaluable even, than field instruction.\r\n\r\nFor the construction of a good relief map the first requisite is a good\r\ncontoured map. To this should be added, when possible, a good hachured\r\nmap, upon which the elevations of the principal points are stated,--if\r\nthe interval in the contoured map is a large one,--and as much material\r\nin the way of photographs and sketches as it is possible to procure.\r\nThe modeler should, moreover, have some personal acquaintance with the\r\nregion to be represented, or, failing that, a general knowledge of\r\ntopographic forms, and at least a clear conception of the general\r\ncharacter of the country which he seeks to represent. This is very\r\nimportant, for it is here that many modelers fail: the mechanical\r\nportion of the work any ordinarily intelligent person can do. A model\r\nmay be as accurate as the map from which it is made, every contour may\r\nbe placed exactly where it belongs, and yet the resulting model may\r\nbe,--indeed, often is--\"flat,\" expressionless, and unsatisfactory.\r\nEvery topographer in drawing his map is compelled to generalize more or\r\nless, and it is fortunate for the map if this be done in the field\r\ninstead of in the draughtsman's office. But topographers differ among\r\nthemselves: there may be, and often is, considerable difference in two\r\nmaps of the same region made by different men; in other words, the\r\n\"personal equation\" is a larger element in a map than is usually\r\nsupposed. This being the case, there is something more required in a\r\nmodeler than the mere transferring of the matter in the map,--giving it\r\nthree dimensions instead of two: he must supply through his special\r\nknowledge of the region (or, failing that through his general\r\nknowledge) certain characteristics that do not appear upon the map, and\r\nundo, so far as it is necessary, certain generalizations of the\r\ntopographer and draughtsman. This artistic or technical skill required\r\ncorrectly to represent the _individuality_ of a given district is\r\nespecially important in the modeler; it is more important, perhaps, in\r\nsmall-scale maps of large districts than in large-scale maps of small\r\nones,--for in the latter the generalizing process has not been carried\r\nso far, and the smaller interval of the contour lines preserves much of\r\nthe detail.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which relief maps are made have always received more\r\nattention than would, at first sight, appear to be their proper\r\nproportion. It may be due, however, to the difficulty of applying any\r\ntest to determine the accuracy of the finished model, and perhaps also\r\nto the general impression that any one can make a relief map,--and so\r\nhe can, though of course there will be a wide difference in the value\r\nof the results. Some, indeed, have devoted their attention to methods\r\nexclusively, letting the result take care of itself,--and the models\r\nshow it. There is no more reason why a modeler should tie himself down\r\nto one method of work, than that a water-colorist, or a chemist, or\r\nanyone engaged in technical work, should do so; though in some cases he\r\nmight be required, as the chemist is, to show his methods as well as\r\nhis results.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest methods, with any pretension to what we may term\r\nmechanical control, is that described by the Messrs. Harden in a paper\r\non \"The construction of maps in relief,\" read before the American\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers in 1887. The method was published in\r\n1838. Upon a contoured map as a basis cross-section lines are drawn at\r\nsmall and regular intervals, and, if the topography be intricate,\r\ncorresponding lines at right angles. The sections thus secured are\r\ntransferred to thin strips of some suitable material, such as\r\ncard-board or metal, and cut down to the surface line,--the strips\r\nthemselves thus forming the cross-sections. These cross-sections are\r\nmounted upon a suitable base-board, and the cavities or boxes are then\r\nfilled up with some easily carved material, such as plaster or wax. The\r\ntop is then carved down to the form of the country or district,--the\r\nnecessary guidance being obtained by the upper edges of the strips that\r\nform the cross-sections. It will be readily seen that this method is a\r\nvery crude and laborious one. It necessitates in the first place a good\r\ncontoured map upon which to draw the sections, but sacrifices much of\r\nthe advantage thus gained because only a number of points on each\r\ncontour line are used, instead of the entire line. It is no better,\r\nalthough actually more laborious, than the later method of driving\r\ncontour pins (whose height above a base-board may be accurately\r\nmeasured,) along the contour lines, and then filling in. A slight\r\nmodification of the latter method can be used to advantage when no\r\ncontoured map is available, and when the points whose elevation is\r\nknown are not numerous enough to permit the construction of one. In\r\nthis case the only control that can be secured is by means of a number\r\nof pins driven into the base-board at those points whose elevation is\r\nknown. The remainder of the map is then sketched in. This method is\r\nperhaps as satisfactory as any, when the material upon the map is\r\nscanty. Another method, however, growing out of the same scantiness of\r\nmaterial, is in some cases to be preferred, especially for large\r\nmodels. The map is enlarged to the required size, and a tracing of it\r\nis mounted upon a frame. Another deep frame, just large enough to\r\ncontain the mounted tracing, is made, and laid upon a suitable\r\nbase-board upon which a copy of the map has been mounted. Upon this\r\nbase-board the model is then commenced, in clay or wax. The low areas\r\nare modeled first,--horizontal control being obtained by pricking\r\nthrough the mounted tracing of the map with a needle point, and\r\nvertical control by measuring down from a straight edge sliding on the\r\ntop of the deep frame. This system is rather crude, and only useful\r\nwhere the material upon the map is very scanty, but it gives excellent\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nA method used by Mr. F. H. King in the preparation of his large map of\r\nthe United States is described by him in a letter to Messrs. Harden,\r\nand published by them in the place mentioned. A solid block of plaster\r\nis used,--the contoured map being transferred to it--and the plaster is\r\ncarved down to produce a series of steps like those made by building up\r\nthe contours. The shoulders are then carved down to produce a\r\ncontinuous surface. This method is one of the best of those that\r\nrequire carving instead of modeling.\r\n\r\nMany other methods of producing relief maps might be mentioned, but, as\r\nmost of them have been used only to make special models, they need not\r\nbe described. The method that has been more used than any other still\r\nremains to be described. It is that which the writer has used almost\r\nexclusively, and consists in building up the model and modeling the\r\ndetail, instead of carving it. It is a maxim of the modeler that the\r\nsubject should be built up as far as possible, should be produced by\r\nadding bits of clay or wax, or other material, and not by carving away\r\nwhat is already on,--by addition and not by subtraction. This may be\r\nillustrated by a reference to the methods of the sculptor. The bust, or\r\nfigure, or whatever the subject may be, is first modeled in clay or\r\nwax; from this model a plaster mould is made, and from this mould a\r\nplaster cast is taken. This cast is called the original, and the\r\nfinished production, whether in marble, bronze, or any other hard\r\nsubstance, is simply a copy of this original. No one ever attempts to\r\nproduce the finished bust or figure directly from the object itself.\r\nEven where the artist has for a guide a death mask, the procedure does\r\nnot change. The bust is first made in clay, and this clay model, as a\r\nrule, contains all the detail which subsequently appears in the\r\nfinished bust. It seems strange, therefore, that the relief map maker\r\nshould use a method which the sculptor, with infinitely more skill and\r\njudgment, is afraid to use; and this on subjects that do not differ as\r\nmuch as might be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe contour interval to be used depends on the use to which the model\r\nis to be put. It is not always necessary to carry into the model all\r\nthe contour lines upon the map: I may go further and say that it is not\r\nalways desirable to do so. The number to be used depends to some extent\r\non the skill of the modeler. As already stated, the contours are only a\r\nmeans of control, and one modeler requires more than another. To build\r\ninto a model every contour in a contoured map of ten foot interval is a\r\nvery laborious proceeding, and not worth the time it takes, as in nine\r\nout of ten maps of such interval only the fifty-foot or the one\r\nhundred-foot curves are definitely fixed, the intermediate lines being\r\nmerely filled in. This filling in can be done as well, or better, by\r\nthe modeler.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the proper amount of exaggeration to be given the\r\nvertical scale, as compared with the horizontal, is the question about\r\nwhich has raged most of the controversy connected with relief map\r\nmaking. This controversy has been rather bitter; some of the opponents\r\nof vertical exaggeration going to the length of saying that no\r\nexaggeration is necessary, and that \"he that will distort or exaggerate\r\nthe scale of anything will lie.\" On the other hand the great majority\r\nof those who have made relief maps insist upon the necessity of more or\r\nless exaggeration of the vertical scale--generally more than seems to\r\nme necessary, however.\r\n\r\nAn increase of angle of slope accompanies all vertical exaggeration,\r\nand this is apparent even in models in which the vertical element is\r\nonly very slightly exaggerated. It produces a false effect by\r\ndiminishing the proportionate width of the valleys, and by making the\r\ncountry seem much more rugged and mountainous than it really is. A\r\nsecondary effect is to make the region represented look very small--all\r\nidea of the extent of the country being lost. This can be illustrated\r\nbetter than described. The King model of the United States is an\r\nexample of one extreme; it is worthy of note that no examples of the\r\nother extreme--too little exaggeration--are known.\r\n\r\nIn small-scale models of large districts some exaggeration of the\r\nvertical scale is necessary in order to make the relief apparent, but\r\nthe amount of this exaggeration is often increased much beyond what is\r\nessential. The proportion of scales must depend to a large extent on\r\nthe character of the country represented, and on the purposes for which\r\nthe model is made. It has been suggested by a writer, quoted by the\r\nMessrs. Harden, that the following exaggeration would afford a pleasing\r\nrelief: \"For a map, scale 6 inches to 1 mile: if mountainous, 1:3; if\r\nonly hilly, 1:2; if gently undulating, 2:3. For smaller scales, except\r\nfor very rugged tracts, the exaggeration should be correspondingly\r\nincreased. For a tract consisting wholly of mountains no exaggeration\r\nis necessary.\" I know of no country of such a character that its\r\nrelief, in all its detail, cannot be shown upon a scale of 6 inches to\r\n1 mile without any exaggeration at all.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the absolute and not the relative amount of relief\r\nis the desideratum, and I have always used this as my guiding\r\nprinciple. For small scale models I have found half an inch of relief\r\nample. It may be worth while to state that in a model of the United\r\nStates made for the Messrs. Butler, of Philadelphia, the horizontal\r\nscale was 77 miles to 1 inch, the vertical scale 40,000 feet to 1 inch,\r\nand the proportion of scales as 1 to 10. This proportion could have\r\nbeen brought down as low as 1:6 with advantage. One-fortieth of an inch\r\nto a thousand feet seems a very small vertical scale, but it sufficed\r\nto show all the important features of the relief. It should be stated,\r\nmoreover, that the model in question was very hurriedly made--in fact,\r\nwas hardly more than a sketch-model--and that more care and more minute\r\nwork would have brought out many details that do not now appear. This\r\namount of care was not considered necessary in this instance, as the\r\nmodel was made to be photographed and published as a photo-engraving,\r\nand was to suffer an enormous reduction--coming down to five by seven\r\ninches.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See plate from \"Butler's Complete Geography.\"]\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently urged by the advocates of large exaggeration\r\nthat the details of a country cannot be shown unless the vertical scale\r\nis exaggerated; that hills 200, 300, or even 500 feet high--depending\r\nof course upon the scale--flatten out or disappear entirely. This seems\r\nplausible, but the advantages of great exaggeration are more apparent\r\nthan real. Its effect upon the model has already been mentioned; it\r\nshould be added that, with the proper amount of care in finishing the\r\nmodel, exceedingly small relief can be so brought out as to be readily\r\nseen. With ordinary care, one-fortieth of an inch can be easily shown,\r\nand with great care and skill certainly one-eightieth and probably\r\none-hundredth of an inch. Another plausible argument that has been\r\nadvanced in favor of vertical exaggeration as a principle, is well\r\nstated by Mr. A. E. Lehman, of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, in a\r\npaper on \"Topographical Models,\" read before the American Institute of\r\nMining Engineers in 1885. \"A perfectly natural expression is of course\r\ndesired; and to cause this the features of the topography should be\r\ndistorted and exaggerated in vertical scale just enough to produce the\r\nsame effect on the beholder or student of the district of country\r\nexhibited as his idea of it would be if he were on the real ground\r\nitself. Care should be taken, however, not to make the scales so\r\ndisproportionate as to do violence to mental impressions. Often,\r\nindeed, prominent or important features, when they will bear it, may be\r\nstill more effectively shown by additional exaggeration in the vertical\r\nscale.\" The fallacy of this argument is obvious. It assumes that the\r\nobject of a model is to show the country as it appears to one passing\r\nthrough it, and not as it really is--and there is often a very wide\r\ndifference between the two. The impression derived from passing through\r\na country is, if I may use the term, a very large-scale impression, as\r\nany one who has tried it can certify; it is certainly a mistake to\r\nattempt to reproduce this impression in a small-scale model, with the\r\nhelp of vertical exaggeration. Even if the principle were a good one,\r\nits application would be very limited. It could only be used in\r\nlarge-scale models; to apply it to a model of a large area--the United\r\nStates, for example--is obviously absurd.\r\n\r\nThe method referred to as being now generally in use may be briefly\r\ndescribed as follows: requisites, a good contoured map; a hachured map\r\nin addition, if possible; a clear conception on the part of the modeler\r\nof the country to be represented; and a fair amount of skill.\r\nMaterials: a base-board of wood or other suitable material; card-board\r\nor wood of the thickness required by the contour interval and the\r\nscale; and modeling wax or clay. Procedure: reproduce the contours in\r\nthe wood or other material; mount these upon the base-board in their\r\nproper relationship; then fill in the intervening spaces, and the space\r\nabove the topmost contour, with the modeling material.\r\n\r\nIn a series of models of the Grand Divisions of the earth, made about a\r\nyear and a half ago, the contours of card-board were made as follows:\r\nthe map was photographed up to the required scale, and as many prints\r\nwere made as there were contour intervals to be represented--in a model\r\nof the United States of 1,000 feet contour interval there were fourteen\r\nprints. Thirteen of these were mounted upon card-board of the exact\r\nthickness required by the vertical scale, and one upon the base-board.\r\nAll large paper companies use a micrometer gauge, and card-board can\r\neasily be obtained of the exact thickness required--even to less than\r\nthe thousandth part of an inch. The lowest contour was then sawed out\r\nupon a scroll saw, and placed upon the corresponding line of the map\r\nmounted upon the base-board. This process was repeated with each of the\r\nsucceeding contours until all were placed and glued into their proper\r\npositions. At this stage the model presents the relief in a series of\r\nsteps, each step representing a rise corresponding to the contour\r\ninterval. The disadvantages of the method lie in the fact that unless\r\nthe greatest care is exercised in making the photographic prints there\r\nwill be considerable distortion, owing to the stretching of the paper\r\nin different directions, and consequently much trouble in fitting the\r\ncontours. If care be exercised in having the grain of the paper run in\r\nthe same direction in all the prints, trouble in fitting the contours\r\nwill be much reduced, but the distortion in one direction will remain.\r\nIn our experience this distortion amounts to about two per cent.; in\r\nother words, a model that should be fifty inches long will in reality\r\nbe fifty-one inches; but, as this error is distributed over the whole\r\nfifty inches, it is not too great for an ordinary model. If greater\r\naccuracy be required, it can be secured by transferring the contours to\r\nthe card-board by means of tracing or transfer paper. The great\r\nadvantage of the photographic method lies in the fact that when the\r\nmodel has been built up, with all the contours in position, it presents\r\na copy of the map itself, with all the details, drainage, etc., in\r\nposition, instead of blank intervals between the contours. Such details\r\nand drainage are a great help in the subsequent modeling.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process is to fill in with clay or wax the\r\nintervals between the contours. I have always found wax more convenient\r\nthan clay for this purpose as, unless the surface coating is a thick\r\none, the clay is difficult to keep moist. To obviate this difficulty,\r\nsome modelers have used clay mixed with glycerine instead of water;\r\nthis, of course, does not become dry, but the material is, at its best,\r\nunsatisfactory. The filling-in process is the most important one in\r\nrelief map making, for it is here that the modeler must show his\r\nknowledge of, and feeling for, topographic forms. Some models seem to\r\nhave been constructed with the idea that when the contours have been\r\naccurately placed the work of the modeler is practically done. This is\r\na great mistake. The card-board contours are only a means of control,\r\noccupying somewhat the same relation to the relief map that a core or\r\nbase of bricks, or a frame of wood, does to other constructions as, for\r\nexample, an architectural ornament or a bust. It is sometimes necessary\r\nto cut away the contour card; for, as has been already explained, a map\r\nis more or less generalized, and a contour is frequently carried across\r\na ravine, instead of following it up, as it would do if the map were on\r\na larger scale. Such generalizing is of course perfectly proper in a\r\nmap, but, with the same scale, we expect more detail in a model. The\r\nmodeler must have judgment enough and skill enough to read between the\r\nlines, and to undo the generalizing of the topographer and draughtsman,\r\nthus supplying the material omitted from the map. This can be done\r\nwithout materially affecting the accuracy of the model, considered even\r\nas a copy of the contoured map.\r\n\r\nThe contours of card-board or other material are, let me repeat, only a\r\nmeans of control. The perfect modeler--a variety, by the way, yet to be\r\nevolved--would be able to make an accurate relief map without them, in\r\nthe same way that other subjects are made; as, for example, a flower\r\npanel, an architectural ornament, or any other subject in low relief,\r\nwhere the object sought is artistic effect and great accuracy is not a\r\ndesideratum. It is the converse of this idea that has produced the\r\nnumerous models that one sees; accurate enough, perhaps, but wholly\r\nexpressionless and absolutely without feeling. This is the great fault\r\nof nearly all models made by building up the contours in wood and then\r\ncarving down the shoulders. It is then necessary to sand-paper them,\r\nand what little character they might otherwise have had is completely\r\nobliterated by the sand-paper. Such models almost invariably _look_\r\nwooden. Let the modeler, then, have a clear conception of his subject\r\nand not depend wholly on the contours, and let him work out that\r\nconception in his model, \"controlled\" and helped by the contours, but\r\nnot bound by them; the resulting model will thus be far more\r\nsatisfactory and a far better representation of his subject, in other\r\nwords, it will be more life-like--more nearly true to nature.\r\n\r\nThe model, provided it be not of clay, is sometimes used in the state\r\nin which it is left when finished. It is much more common, however, to\r\nmake a plaster mould, and from this a plaster cast. For this purpose a\r\nmoulder is usually called in; but moulders as a rule are ignorant men,\r\naccustomed to one line of work only, and the result is not always\r\nsatisfactory. It is much better for the modeler himself to do this\r\nwork, though to obtain good results from plaster it is necessary to\r\nknow the material thoroughly, and this knowledge comes only from\r\nexperience. The mould is generally made quite heavy, in order to stand\r\nthe subsequent hard treatment that it may receive, and should be\r\nretouched and thoroughly dried before being prepared for the cast. The\r\nmethod used by some modelers of placing a frame about the model and\r\npouring in the plaster, filling the frame to the top, is a crude and\r\nvery wasteful one and not at all to be recommended. In a model of large\r\nsize--say seven or eight feet square--it would require a derrick to\r\nmove the mould. It is wholly unnecessary, as, with a small amount of\r\ncare, a good mould can be made not more than an inch thick, or, at\r\nmost, an inch and a half. The drying of the mould before use can\r\nsometimes be dispensed with, but is always desirable.\r\n\r\nNearly all American moulders (as distinguished from French and Italian\r\nones) varnish the mould, and thus lose some of the finest detail and\r\nsharpness. This is unnecessary. The mould can be easily prepared with a\r\nsolution of soap so as to leave nothing on the surface but a very thin\r\ncoating of oil, which is taken up and replaced by the plaster of the\r\ncast. Of course, if the model has been sand-papered, no fine work in\r\nmoulding or casting is necessary, as there is nothing to save. If the\r\nsubject is a very intricate one, with \"undercuts\" (as they are called),\r\nit is customary to make a waste mould; as this is very seldom necessary\r\nin relief map work, however, the process need not be described.\r\n\r\nTo make the cast it is only necessary to repeat the processes used in\r\nmaking the mould. With great care and some skill a cast can be produced\r\nbut little inferior in point of sharpness and detail to the original\r\nmodel. It is customary to make the cast very thick, and, consequently,\r\nvery heavy; this is unnecessary. In our work we seldom make a cast\r\nthicker than one inch, and yet are never troubled with changes in the\r\nmodel after it is finished. Even in a very large cast (now in the\r\nNational Museum), weighing nearly 1,500 pounds and presenting a surface\r\nof over 160 square feet, the average thickness is less than one inch,\r\nalthough it required over five barrels of plaster to make it. The cast,\r\nafter being thoroughly dried, should be finished--all its imperfections\r\nbeing carefully repaired. The surface, however, should be touched as\r\nlittle as possible, as the slight roughness of surface that comes from\r\nthe original model, through the mould, is removed by any tooling. This\r\nroughness adds much to the effect of the model; in fact, where the\r\nscale is large enough, it is sometimes desirable to emphasize it.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to paint a model is a matter that must rest principally\r\nupon the judgment of the modeler, depending to some extent, also, on\r\nthe use to which the model is to be put. The plain cast is sometimes\r\nused, drainage, lettering, etc., being put directly upon it. This has\r\nthe advantage of preserving all the detail that comes from the mould,\r\nbut it has also the disadvantage of a surface easily soiled and\r\nimpossible to clean. If the model is to be photographed, the surface\r\nshould be nearly white--in our practice we use a small amount of yellow\r\nwith the white. This yellow is hardly appreciable by the eye, but its\r\neffect upon the photographic negative is quite marked. Yellow becomes\r\ngrey in a photograph, and, in a photograph of a model colored as\r\ndescribed, a grey tint is given to the whole surface. The high lights\r\nare not pure white, and there is no harsh contrast between light and\r\nshade. There is another point of great importance in photographing\r\nmodels: the surface should have a dead finish--that is, should have no\r\ngloss, or, at most, should have only what is known among painters as an\r\negg-shell gloss. It is almost impossible satisfactorily to photograph a\r\nmodel that has a shiny surface. Any portion of a model that it is\r\ndesired to separate from the rest should be painted a different\r\ncolor--the water, for example, should be painted a light blue; not a\r\nblue composed of indigo, however, or any of the grey blues, as these\r\nproduce in the photograph a dead grey, and are not pleasant to the eye.\r\nThe most satisfactory color that we have used is a mixture of\r\ncobalt--the purest of the blues--with Antwerp blue--which is quite\r\ngreen--and white. This gives a color that is pleasant to the eye, has\r\nthe retreating quality to perfection, and photographs well.\r\n\r\nModels intended for exhibition as such should be painted realistically.\r\nThere is room here for an immense improvement in the usual practice,\r\nwhich is to paint the model either in some conventional scheme of light\r\nand shade, or else to put a single flat tint upon it. If the model is\r\nto be colored conventionally it is, in my opinion, much better to use a\r\nflat tint, light in tone, and with a dead surface. The use of a variety\r\nof colors upon the face of a model interferes materially with the\r\nrelief, especially if the relief is finely modeled. For this reason\r\nmodels colored to indicate geologic formations should always be\r\naccompanied by duplicates representing topography only, colored\r\nrealistically, if possible, and without lettering. Well-defined lines\r\nother than those pertaining to the model itself, such, for example, as\r\nthose used to define the boundaries of geologic formations, should not\r\nbe allowed upon a model when it is desired to bring out all the relief.\r\nThe lettering on such models should be kept down as small as possible,\r\nor wholly dispensed with. The latter is much the better method.\r\n\r\nThe cheap reproduction of models is the most important problem\r\nconnected with the art, and the one that is attracting most attention\r\namong those engaged in it; as, until models can be reproduced cheaply,\r\nthey will never have any wide distribution and there will be far less\r\nincentive to the modeler. Various materials have been suggested and\r\nexperimented on, but nine-tenths of the models that are made to-day are\r\nmade of plaster of Paris. Although this material was the first to be\r\nused for this purpose, it has not yet been superseded. A plaster cast\r\nis heavy, expensive and easily injured; but plaster gives an accurate\r\ncopy of the original, retains permanently the form given it, and is\r\neasily finished and repaired. The weight is an obstacle that can be\r\neasily overcome. By the incorporation in the plaster of fine tow, or of\r\nbagging or netting of various kinds, the cast can be made very light\r\nand at the same time strong, but the expense is increased rather than\r\ndiminished by this method. Models made in this way, however, have the\r\nadvantage that when broken the pieces do not fall out, they are,\r\nhowever, fully as liable to surface injury as the other kind. The large\r\ncast in the National Museum, before referred to, was made in this way.\r\nIt weighed nearly 2,000 pounds when boxed--not an easy thing to\r\nhandle--but it stood shipment to New Orleans and back without suffering\r\nany material injury. This would hardly have been possible had the cast\r\nbeen made from plaster alone.\r\n\r\nPaper seems, at first sight, to be the material best adapted for the\r\nreproduction of models; but no one has succeeded well enough with it to\r\nbring it into use. Like nearly all those who have given this subject\r\nattention, I have experimented with paper, but the only positive result\r\nhas been a loss of a large part of the confidence that I once had in\r\nthe suitability of the material. Paper has been used extensively for\r\nlarge scale models of pueblos, ruins, etc., but I have never obtained a\r\nsatisfactory result with subjects in low relief and fine detail. A\r\npaper cast may look well when first made, but it absorbs moisture from\r\nthe atmosphere, and contracts and expands with the weather. The\r\ncontraction is apt to flatten out the model and the expansion to make\r\nit buckle up.\r\n\r\nCasts of models have been made in iron; but this, while suitable\r\nperhaps for models of mounds and subjects of like character, would\r\nhardly be applicable to small scale models with fine detail; such casts\r\nrequire too much surface finishing. The material known as\r\nLincrusta-Walton seems to me to be the ideal material for this purpose.\r\nIt is tougher than rubber, will take the finest detail, and its surface\r\ncan be treated in any way desired. Unfortunately the manufacture of\r\nmodels in this material would require expensive machinery, and is\r\noutside the scope of a modeling room. Should it ever become\r\ncommercially advantageous, however, casts of a model of ordinary size,\r\nin every way equal to the original, can be turned out in this material\r\nat a very small cost.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of the reproduction of models by\r\nprocess-engravings--a method that will probably receive much more\r\nattention in the future than it has in the past. It is perhaps along\r\nthis line that the cheap reproduction of models will develop; but the\r\nsubject is too large a one to be adequately treated here, and must be\r\npostponed until some future occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HACHURED AND CONTOURED MAPS.\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION OF A HILL ACCORDING TO THE TWO SYSTEMS AND ON DIFFERENT\r\nSCALES.\r\n\r\nFrom Supplement to Enthoffer's Topographical Atlas by permission of Mr.\r\nEnthoffer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM BUTLER'S COMPLETE GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1888, BY E.

Lerch.)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL LITERARY CONTEST\r\n\r\nTo be held at Madrid, Spain, under the auspices of the Commission in\r\ncharge of the celebration of the Fourth Centennial Anniversary of the\r\nDiscovery of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM.\r\n\r\nThe work for which a prize is offered is to be a prose essay, a true\r\nhistoric picture giving a just estimate of the grandeur of the occasion\r\nto be celebrated.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written on this subject since the opening of the XVIth\r\ncentury that it would seem difficult to say anything new and good.\r\nPerhaps the details, perhaps the circumstances in the life and acts of\r\nColumbus are worthy of no little research; but already the Royal\r\nAcademy of History is engaged in the erudite and diligent task of\r\nbringing together and publishing the un-edited or little known papers\r\nbearing on this question.\r\n\r\nThe book required by this contest must be of a different nature: it\r\nmust be comprehensive and synoptic, and must be sufficiently concise\r\nwithout being either obscure or dry.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is an abundance of histories of America, of voyages and\r\ndiscoveries, of geographic science, and of the establishment of\r\nEuropeans in remote regions of the earth, there is no book that sets\r\nforth as it can be done the combined efforts of the nations of the\r\nIberian peninsula, who, since the commencement of the XVth century,\r\nhave, with a fixity of purpose and marvelous tenacity, in almost a\r\nsingle century of silent efforts brought about the exploration of vast\r\ncontinents and islands, traversed seas never before cut by Christian\r\nprows, and in emulous strife obtained almost a complete knowledge of\r\nthe planet on which we live.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing interest and manifest unity in all those more\r\nimportant events; not to mention the circumstantial evidence borne by\r\nthe charts of 1375 and the semi-fabulous voyages, such as that of Doria\r\ny Vivaldi and others less apocryphal though isolated and barren of\r\nresults, like that of Ferrer, begun in 1434, when Gil Eannes doubled\r\nCape Bojador, discovered Guinea, and dispelled the terror inspired by\r\nthe unknown ocean, and ended in 1522 with Elcano's arrival at Sanlucar\r\nafter circumnavigating the globe.\r\n\r\nIn all this activity very little occurs by chance. The progressive\r\nseries of geographic discoveries, due to persistent premeditation and\r\nnot to accident, was inaugurated at Sagres by the Infante D. Enrique\r\nand his illustrious pilot Jaime de Mallorca.\r\n\r\nWell might Pedro Nuñes exclaim that from that time forth until the form\r\nand size of the terraqueous globe were thoroughly known, the most to be\r\nobtained would not be firmly established, \"unless our mariners sailed\r\naway better instructed and provided with better instruments and rules\r\nof Astronomy and Geography than the things with which cosmographers\r\nsupplied them.\"\r\n\r\nThe culmination in the progress of that beautiful history falls on the\r\n12th of October, 1492, when Columbus was the first European to set foot\r\nupon the intertropical shores of the New World. But this act,\r\nconsidered apart from its intrinsic value, as purely the individual\r\ninspiration of a mariner and the generous enthusiasm of a patron Queen,\r\nderives a higher value when regarded as part of a summation of efforts,\r\na grand development of an idea, a purpose to explore and know the whole\r\nglobe, to spread the name and the law of Christ together with the\r\ncivilization of Europe, and to reap a harvest of gold, spices, and all\r\nthe riches of which costly samples and exaggerated reports were\r\nfurnished by the traffic of the Venetians, Genoese and Catalonians, who\r\nin turn got them from Mussulmans.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the moving cause, whose gorgeous banner so many men of our\r\npeninsula followed, was clothed in great sentiments, good or bad; their\r\nhearts were filled with religious fervor, thirst for glory, ambition,\r\nChristian love, cupidity, curiosity, and violent dissatisfaction (even\r\nduring the Renaissance), to seek and undergo real adventures that\r\nshould surpass the vain, fruitless, and fanciful adventures of\r\nchivalry; and to make voyages and conquests eclipsing those of the\r\nGreeks and Romans, many of which, recorded in classic histories and\r\nfables, were now disinterred by the learned.\r\n\r\nWhat must be described is the complete picture in all its sumptuousness\r\nso that its magnificent meaning may stand out distinctly, without which\r\nthe conviction would be lacking that the studies, voyages, and happy\r\naudacity of Bartolomé Diaz, Gama, Alburquerque, Cabral, Balboa,\r\nMagallanes, Cortes, Pizarro, Orellana, and a host of others, do not dim\r\nthe glory of the hero whose centennary is to be celebrated, even though\r\nit heighten and add greater luster to the work of civilization begun by\r\nPortugal....\r\n\r\nThe book here vaguely outlined must also contain a compendious\r\nintroduction, notices of voyages, ideas, and geographic progress up to\r\nthe date of D. Enrique's establishment at Sagres, and an epilogue or\r\nconclusion of greater extent, in which are examined and weighed the\r\nchanges and progress that our subject has made, collectively, in the\r\ncivilization of the world--in the commerce, economics and politics of\r\nthe peoples, in regard to the broad field opened to the intelligent\r\nactivity of Europe, over which it could spread and dominate; the\r\nabundance of data, sunken hopes, and more secure basis lent to the\r\nstudious and wise for the extension of our knowledge of Nature, the\r\nunraveling of her laws, and penetration of her mysteries.\r\n\r\nThe vast, elevated argument of the book requires it be a finished work\r\nof art, not in fullness and richness of diction, but in plan and order,\r\nin sobriety and unity of style, whose nobility and beauty must lie in\r\nsimplicity of phrase, correctness of judgment and richness of thought.\r\n\r\nThere may enter into this contest any unpublished work written to this\r\nend in Spanish, Portuguese, English, German, French or Italian.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal that is to award the prize will be composed of two members\r\nof the R. Acad. of History, and one member from each of the Spanish R.\r\nAcademies of Moral Sciences and Politics, and Exact and Natural\r\nSciences--all to be chosen by the Academies themselves.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there will be included in the tribunal the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of every power whose subject or subjects wish to enter\r\nthe contest, which is to be done through said representative or some\r\nperson duly appointed to act in his place.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal will elect its presiding officer and will decide on the\r\nbest works by an absolute majority of all the jurors who take part in\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\nEach work submitted in this contest must be neatly copied, in legible\r\nwriting, on good paper, without the author's name but with a quotation\r\nto identify him afterwards.\r\n\r\nEach author will inclose a separate folded sheet on whose exterior is\r\nwritten the quotation he has chosen and the opening sentence of his\r\nwork; within, he will write his name and residence.\r\n\r\nThe folded sheets corresponding to the works that did not get a prize\r\nwill be burnt publicly without being opened.\r\n\r\nThough it is difficult to set a limit as to size, the works should not\r\nhave more reading matter than is contained in two volumes of the shape\r\nand size of the complete works of Cervantes issued by Rivadeneyra in\r\n1863-4.\r\n\r\nIf the plan or purpose of any of the works require it, there may be\r\nadded another volume of documents, maps, or other illustrations.\r\n\r\nAs it will take time to examine and judge the works, they should be\r\nsent to the Secretary of the R. Acad. of Hist. prior to January 1,\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThere will be first prize of 30,000 pesetas ($5,790) and a second of\r\n15,000 pesetas ($2,895).\r\n\r\nBesides this, each of the two successful authors will receive 500\r\ncopies of the printed edition of his work.\r\n\r\nIt rests with the Centennial Commission to determine the number of\r\ncopies in the edition of each of the two prize works, and what\r\ndisposition is to be made of the copies that are not given to the\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nThese (the authors) keep the right to re-print and to sell their works,\r\nand to translate them into other tongues.\r\n\r\nThe Commission, however, will have the right, if either or both prize\r\nworks are in a foreign tongue, to have them translated and published in\r\nCastilian.\r\n\r\nThe Commission affix their seal to the preceding directions for the\r\ninformation of the public and government of those persons who desire to\r\nparticipate in the contest.\r\n\r\nMadrid, June 19, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President, DUKE OF VERAGUA.\r\n\r\nSecretaries, JUAN VALERA, JUAN F.
