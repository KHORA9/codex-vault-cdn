These comprised nearly\r\nthree thousand bird-skins of about one thousand species, at least twenty\r\nthousand beetles and butterflies of about seven thousand species, and\r\nsome quadrupeds and land shells besides. A large proportion of these\r\nI had not seen for years, and in my then weakened state of health, the\r\nunpacking, sorting, and arranging of such a mass of specimens occupied a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nI very soon decided that until I had done something towards naming and\r\ndescribing the most important groups in my collection, and had worked\r\nout some of the more interesting problems of variation and geographical\r\ndistribution (of which I had had glimpses while collecting them), I\r\nwould not attempt to publish my travels. Indeed, I could have printed\r\nmy notes and journals at once, leaving all reference to questions of\r\nnatural history for a future work; but, I felt that this would be as\r\nunsatisfactory to myself as it would be disappointing to my friends, and\r\nuninstructive to the public.\r\n\r\nSince my return, up to this date, I have published eighteen papers\r\nin the \"Transactions\" or \"Proceedings of the Linnean Zoological and\r\nEntomological Societies\", describing or cataloguing portions of my\r\ncollections, along with twelve others in various scientific periodicals\r\non more general subjects connected with them.\r\n\r\nNearly two thousand of my Coleoptera, and many hundreds of my\r\nbutterflies, have been already described by various eminent naturalists,\r\nBritish and foreign; but a much larger number remains undescribed. Among\r\nthose to whom science is most indebted for this laborious work, I must\r\nname Mr. F. P. Pascoe, late President of the Entomological Society of\r\nLondon, who had almost completed the classification and description\r\nof my large collection of Longicorn beetles (now in his possession),\r\ncomprising more than a thousand species, of which at least nine hundred\r\nwere previously undescribed and new to European cabinets.\r\n\r\nThe remaining orders of insects, comprising probably more than two\r\nthousand species, are in the collection of Mr. William Wilson Saunders,\r\nwho has caused the larger portion of them to be described by good\r\nentomologists. The Hymenoptera alone amounted to more than nine hundred\r\nspecies, among which were two hundred and eighty different kinds of\r\nants, of which two hundred were new.\r\n\r\nThe six years' delay in publishing my travels thus enables me to give\r\nwhat I hope may be an interesting and instructive sketch of the main\r\nresults yet arrived at by the study of my collections; and as the\r\ncountries I have to describe are not much visited or written about, and\r\ntheir social and physical conditions are not liable to rapid change, I\r\nbelieve and hope that my readers will gain much more than they will\r\nlose by not having read my book six years ago, and by this time perhaps\r\nforgotten all about it.\r\n\r\nI must now say a few words on the plan of my work.\r\n\r\nMy journeys to the various islands were regulated by the seasons and\r\nthe means of conveyance. I visited some islands two or three times at\r\ndistant intervals, and in some cases had to make the same voyage four\r\ntimes over. A chronological arrangement would have puzzled my readers.\r\nThey would never have known where they were, and my frequent references\r\nto the groups of islands, classed in accordance with the peculiarities\r\nof their animal productions and of their human inhabitants, would have\r\nbeen hardly intelligible. I have adopted, therefore, a geographical,\r\nzoological, and ethnological arrangement, passing from island to island\r\nin what seems the most natural succession, while I transgress the order\r\nin which I myself visited them, as little as possible.\r\n\r\nI divide the Archipelago into five groups of islands, as follows:\r\n\r\nI. THE INDO-MALAY ISLANDS: comprising the Malay Peninsula and Singapore,\r\nBorneo, Java, and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nII. THE TIMOR GROUP: comprising the islands of Timor, Flores, Sumbawa,\r\nand Lombock, with several smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIII. CELEBES: comprising also the Sula Islands and Bouton.\r\n\r\nIV. THE MOLUCCAN GROUP: comprising Bouru, Ceram, Batchian, Gilolo,\r\nand Morty; with the smaller islands of Ternate, Tidore, Makian, Kaióa,\r\nAmboyna, Banda, Goram, and Matabello.\r\n\r\nV. THE PAPUAN GROUP: comprising the great island of New Guinea, with\r\nthe Aru Islands, Mysol, Salwatty, Waigiou, and several others. The Ke\r\nIslands are described with this group on account of their ethnology,\r\nthough zoologically and geographically they belong to the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe chapters relating to the separate islands of each of these groups\r\nare followed by one on the Natural History of that group; and the work\r\nmay thus be divided into five parts, each treating one of the natural\r\ndivisions of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter is an introductory one, on the Physical Geography of\r\nthe whole region; and the last is a general sketch of the races of man\r\nin the Archipelago and the surrounding countries. With this explanation,\r\nand a reference to the maps which illustrate the work, I trust that my\r\nreaders will always know where they are, and in what direction they are\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that my book is far too small for the extent of the\r\nsubjects it touches upon. It is a mere sketch; but so far as it goes,\r\nI have endeavoured to make it an accurate one. Almost the whole of the\r\nnarrative and descriptive portions were written on the spot, and\r\nhave had little more than verbal alterations. The chapters on Natural\r\nHistory, as well as many passages in other parts of the work, have been\r\nwritten in the hope of exciting an interest in the various questions\r\nconnected with the origin of species and their geographical\r\ndistribution. In some cases I have been able to explain my views in\r\ndetail; while in others, owing to the greater complexity of the subject,\r\nI have thought it better to confine myself to a statement of the more\r\ninteresting facts of the problem, whose solution is to be found in the\r\nprinciples developed by Mr. Darwin in his various works. The numerous\r\nillustrations will, it is believed, add much to the interest and value\r\nof the book. They have been made from my own sketches, from photographs,\r\nor from specimens--and such, only subjects that would really illustrate\r\nthe narrative or the descriptions, have been chosen.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Messrs. Walter and Henry Woodbury, whose acquaintance\r\nI had the pleasure of making in Java, for a number of photographs of\r\nscenery and of natives, which have been of the greatest assistance to\r\nme. Mr. William Wilson Saunders has kindly allowed me to figure the\r\ncurious horned flies; and to Mr. Pascoe I am indebted for a loan of\r\ntwo of the very rare Longicorns which appear in the plate of Bornean\r\nbeetles. All the other specimens figured are in my own collection.\r\n\r\nAs the main object of all my journeys was to obtain specimens of natural\r\nhistory, both for my private collection and to supply duplicates to\r\nmuseums and amateurs, I will give a general statement of the number of\r\nspecimens I collected, and which reached home in good condition. I must\r\npremise that I generally employed one or two, and sometimes three Malay\r\nservants to assist me; and for nearly half the time had the services of\r\nan English lad, Charles Allen. I was just eight years away from England,\r\nbut as I travelled about fourteen thousand miles within the Archipelago,\r\nand made sixty or seventy separate journeys, each involving some\r\npreparation and loss of time, I do not think that more than six years\r\nwere really occupied in collecting.\r\n\r\nI find that my Eastern collections amounted to:\r\n\r\n\r\n     310 specimens of Mammalia.\r\n     100 specimens of Reptiles.\r\n     8,050 specimens of Birds.\r\n     7,500 specimens of Shells.\r\n     13,100 specimens of Lepidoptera.\r\n     83,200 specimens of Coleoptera.\r\n     13,400 specimens of other Insects.\r\n\r\n     125,660 specimens of natural history in all.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for me to thank all those friends to whom I am\r\nindebted for assistance or information. My thanks are more especially\r\ndue to the Council of the Royal Geographical Society, through whose\r\nvaluable recommendations I obtained important aid from our own\r\nGovernment and from that of Holland; and to Mr. William Wilson Saunders,\r\nwhose kind and liberal encouragement in the early portion of my journey\r\nwas of great service to me. I am also greatly indebted to Mr. Samuel\r\nStevens (who acted as my agent), both for the care he took of my\r\ncollections, and for the untiring assiduity with which he kept me\r\nsupplied, both with useful information and with whatever necessaries I\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nI trust that these, and all other friends who have been in any way\r\ninterested in my travels and collections, may derive from the perusal of\r\nmy book, some faint reflexion of the pleasures I myself enjoyed amid the\r\nscenes and objects it describes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nFrom a look at a globe or a map of the Eastern hemisphere, we shall\r\nperceive between Asia and Australia a number of large and small islands\r\nforming a connected group distinct from those great masses of land, and\r\nhaving little connection with either of them. Situated upon the Equator,\r\nand bathed by the tepid water of the great tropical oceans, this region\r\nenjoys a climate more uniformly hot and moist than almost any other part\r\nof the globe, and teems with natural productions which are elsewhere\r\nunknown. The richest of fruits and the most precious of spices are\r\nIndigenous here. It produces the giant flowers of the Rafflesia, the\r\ngreat green-winged Ornithoptera (princes among the butterfly tribes),\r\nthe man-like Orangutan, and the gorgeous Birds of Paradise. It is\r\ninhabited by a peculiar and interesting race of mankind--the Malay,\r\nfound nowhere beyond the limits of this insular tract, which has hence\r\nbeen named the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary Englishman this is perhaps the least known part of the\r\nglobe. Our possessions in it are few and scanty; scarcely any of our\r\ntravellers go to explore it; and in many collections of maps it is\r\nalmost ignored, being divided between Asia and the Pacific Islands. It\r\nthus happens that few persons realize that, as a whole, it is comparable\r\nwith the primary divisions of the globe, and that some of its separate\r\nislands are larger than France or the Austrian Empire. The traveller,\r\nhowever, soon acquires different ideas. He sails for days or even weeks\r\nalong the shores of one of these great islands, often so great that its\r\ninhabitants believe it to be a vast continent. He finds that voyages\r\namong these islands are commonly reckoned by weeks and months, and that\r\ntheir several inhabitants are often as little known to each other as are\r\nthe native races of the northern to those of the southern continent of\r\nAmerica. He soon comes to look upon this region as one apart from the\r\nrest of the world, with its own races of men and its own aspects of\r\nnature; with its own ideas, feelings, customs, and modes of speech, and\r\nwith a climate, vegetation, and animated life altogether peculiar to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFrom many points of view these islands form one compact geographical\r\nwhole, and as such they have always been treated by travellers and men\r\nof science; but, a more careful and detailed study of them under various\r\naspects reveals the unexpected fact that they are divisible into two\r\nportions nearly equal in extent which differ widely in their natural\r\nproducts, and really form two parts of the primary divisions of the\r\nearth. I have been able to prove this in considerable detail by\r\nmy observations on the natural history of the various parts of the\r\nArchipelago; and, as in the description of my travels and residence in\r\nthe several islands I shall have to refer continually to this view, and\r\nadduce facts in support of it, I have thought it advisable to commence\r\nwith a general sketch of the main features of the Malayan region as will\r\nrender the facts hereafter brought forward more interesting, and their\r\nbearing upon the general question more easily understood. I proceed,\r\ntherefore, to sketch the limits and extent of the Archipelago, and to\r\npoint out the more striking features of its geology, physical geography,\r\nvegetation, and animal life.\r\n\r\nDefinition and Boundaries.--For reasons which depend mainly on the\r\ndistribution of animal life, I consider the Malay Archipelago to include\r\nthe Malay Peninsula as far as Tenasserim and the Nicobar Islands on the\r\nwest, the Philippines on the north, and the Solomon Islands, beyond New\r\nGuinea, on the east. All the great islands included within these limits\r\nare connected together by innumerable smaller ones, so that no one\r\nof them seems to be distinctly separated from the rest. With but few\r\nexceptions all enjoy an uniform and very similar climate, and are\r\ncovered with a luxuriant forest vegetation. Whether we study their form\r\nand distribution on maps, or actually travel from island to island, our\r\nfirst impression will be that they form a connected whole, all the parts\r\nof which are intimately related to each other.\r\n\r\nExtent of the Archipelago and Islands.--The Malay Archipelago extends\r\nfor more than 4,000 miles in length from east to west, and is about\r\n1,300 in breadth from north to south. It would stretch over an expanse\r\nequal to that of all Europe from the extreme west far into Central Asia,\r\nor would cover the widest parts of South America, and extend far beyond\r\nthe land into the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It includes three islands\r\nlarger than Great Britain; and in one of them, Borneo, the whole of the\r\nBritish Isles might be set down, and would be surrounded by a sea of\r\nforests. New Guinea, though less compact in shape, is probably larger\r\nthan Borneo. Sumatra is about equal in extent to Great Britain; Java,\r\nLuzon, and Celebes are each about the size of Ireland. Eighteen more\r\nislands are, on the average, as large as Jamaica; more than a hundred\r\nare as large as the Isle of Wight; while the isles and islets of smaller\r\nsize are innumerable.\r\n\r\nThe absolute extent of land in the Archipelago is not greater than that\r\ncontained by Western Europe from Hungary to Spain; but, owing to the\r\nmanner in which the land is broken up and divided, the variety of its\r\nproductions is rather in proportion to the immense surface over which\r\nthe islands are spread, than to the quantity of land which they contain.\r\n\r\nGeological Contrasts.--One of the chief volcanic belts upon the globe\r\npasses through the Archipelago, and produces a striking contrast in the\r\nscenery of the volcanic and non-volcanic islands. A curving line, marked\r\nout by scores of active, and hundreds of extinct, volcanoes may be\r\ntraced through the whole length of Sumatra and Java, and thence by the\r\nislands of Bali, Lombock, Sumbawa, Flores, the Serwatty Islands, Banda,\r\nAmboyna, Batchian, Makian, Tidore, Ternate, and Gilolo, to Morty Island.\r\nHere there is a slight but well-marked break, or shift, of about 200\r\nmiles to the westward, where the volcanic belt begins again in North\r\nCelebes, and passes by Siau and Sanguir to the Philippine Islands along\r\nthe eastern side of which it continues, in a curving line, to their\r\nnorthern extremity. From the extreme eastern bend of this belt at Banda,\r\nwe pass onwards for 1,000 miles over a non-volcanic district to the\r\nvolcanoes observed by Dampier, in 1699, on the north-eastern coast\r\nof New Guinea, and can there trace another volcanic belt through New\r\nBritain, New Ireland, and the Solomon Islands, to the eastern limits of\r\nthe Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn the whole region occupied by this vast line of volcanoes, and for a\r\nconsiderable breadth on each side of it, earthquakes are of continual\r\nrecurrence, slight shocks being felt at intervals of every few weeks or\r\nmonths, while more severe ones, shaking down whole villages, and doing\r\nmore or less injury to life and property, are sure to happen, in one\r\npart or another of this district, almost every year. On many of the\r\nislands the years of the great earthquakes form the chronological\r\nepochs of the native inhabitants, by the aid of which the ages of their\r\nchildren are remembered, and the dates of many important events are\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nI can only briefly allude to the many fearful eruptions that have taken\r\nplace in this region. In the amount of injury to life and property, and\r\nin the magnitude of their effects, they have not been surpassed by\r\nany upon record. Forty villages were destroyed by the eruption of\r\nPapandayang in Java, in 1772, when the whole mountain was blown up by\r\nrepeated explosions, and a large lake left in its place. By the great\r\neruption of Tomboro in Sumbawa, in 1815, 12,000 people were destroyed,\r\nand the ashes darkened the air and fell thickly upon the earth and sea\r\nfor 300 miles around. Even quite recently, since I left the country, a\r\nmountain which had been quiescent for more than 200 years suddenly burst\r\ninto activity. The island of Makian, one of the Moluccas, was rent\r\nopen in 1646 by a violent eruption which left a huge chasm on one side,\r\nextending into the heart of the mountain. It was, when I last visited\r\nit in 1860, clothed with vegetation to the summit, and contained twelve\r\npopulous Malay villages. On the 29th of December, 1862, after 215 years\r\nof perfect inaction, it again suddenly burst forth, blowing up and\r\ncompletely altering the appearance of the mountain, destroying the\r\ngreater part of the inhabitants, and sending forth such volumes of ashes\r\nas to darken the air at Ternate, forty miles off, and to almost entirely\r\ndestroy the growing crops on that and the surrounding islands.\r\n\r\nThe island of Java contains more volcanoes, active and extinct, than\r\nany other known district of equal extent. They are about forty-five in\r\nnumber, and many of them exhibit most beautiful examples of the volcanic\r\ncone on a large scale, single or double, with entire or truncated\r\nsummits, and averaging 10,000 feet high.\r\n\r\nIt is now well ascertained that almost all volcanoes have been slowly\r\nbuilt up by the accumulation of matter--mud, ashes, and lava--ejected\r\nby themselves. The openings or craters, however, frequently shift their\r\nposition, so that a country may be covered with a more or less irregular\r\nseries of hills in chains and masses, only here and there rising into\r\nlofty cones, and yet the whole may be produced by true volcanic action.\r\nIn this manner the greater part of Java has been formed. There has been\r\nsome elevation, especially on the south coast, where extensive cliffs\r\nof coral limestone are found; and there may be a substratum of older\r\nstratified rocks; but still essentially Java is volcanic, and that noble\r\nand fertile island--the very garden of the East, and perhaps upon the\r\nwhole the richest, the best cultivated, and the best governed tropical\r\nisland in the world--owes its very existence to the same intense\r\nvolcanic activity which still occasionally devastates its surface.\r\n\r\nThe great island of Sumatra exhibits, in proportion to its extent, a\r\nmuch smaller number of volcanoes, and a considerable portion of it has\r\nprobably a non-volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward, the long string of islands from Java, passing by the\r\nnorth of Timor and away to Banda, are probably all due to volcanic\r\naction. Timor itself consists of ancient stratified rocks, but is said\r\nto have one volcano near its centre.\r\n\r\nGoing northward, Amboyna, a part of Bouru, and the west end of Ceram,\r\nthe north part of Gilolo, and all the small islands around it, the\r\nnorthern extremity of Celebes, and the islands of Siau and Sanguir, are\r\nwholly volcanic. The Philippine Archipelago contains many active\r\nand extinct volcanoes, and has probably been reduced to its present\r\nfragmentary condition by subsidences attending on volcanic action.\r\n\r\nAll along this great line of volcanoes are to be found more or less\r\npalpable signs of upheaval and depression of land. The range of islands\r\nsouth of Sumatra, a part of the south coast of Java and of the islands\r\neast of it, the west and east end of Timor, portions of all the\r\nMoluccas, the Ke and Aru Islands, Waigiou, and the whole south and east\r\nof Gilolo, consist in a great measure of upraised coral-rock, exactly\r\ncorresponding to that now forming in the adjacent seas. In many places\r\nI have observed the unaltered surfaces of the elevated reefs, with great\r\nmasses of coral standing up in their natural position, and hundreds of\r\nshells so fresh-looking that it was hard to believe that they had\r\nbeen more than a few years out of the water; and, in fact, it is very\r\nprobable that such changes have occurred within a few centuries.\r\n\r\nThe united lengths of these volcanic belts is about ninety degrees,\r\nor one-fourth of the entire circumference of the globe. Their width is\r\nabout fifty miles; but, for a space of two hundred miles on each side\r\nof them, evidences of subterranean action are to be found in recently\r\nelevated coral-rock, or in barrier coral-reefs, indicating recent\r\nsubmergence. In the very centre or focus of the great curve of volcanoes\r\nis placed the large island of Borneo, in which no sign of recent\r\nvolcanic action has yet been observed, and where earthquakes, so\r\ncharacteristic of the surrounding regions, are entirely unknown. The\r\nequally large island of New Guinea occupies another quiescent area,\r\non which no sign of volcanic action has yet been discovered. With the\r\nexception of the eastern end of its northern peninsula, the large and\r\ncuriously-shaped island of Celebes is also entirely free from volcanoes;\r\nand there is some reason to believe that the volcanic portion has once\r\nformed a separate island. The Malay Peninsula is also non-volcanic.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious division of the Archipelago would therefore\r\nbe into quiescent and volcanic regions, and it might, perhaps, be\r\nexpected that such a division would correspond to some differences in\r\nthe character of the vegetation and the forms of life. This is the case,\r\nhowever, to a very limited extent; and we shall presently see that,\r\nalthough this development of subterranean fires is on so vast a\r\nscale--has piled up chains of mountains ten or twelve thousand feet\r\nhigh--has broken up continents and raised up islands from the ocean--yet\r\nit has all the character of a recent action which has not yet succeeded\r\nin obliterating the traces of a more ancient distribution of land and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nContrasts of Vegetation.--Placed immediately upon the Equator and\r\nsurrounded by extensive oceans, it is not surprising that the various\r\nislands of the Archipelago should be almost always clothed with a forest\r\nvegetation from the level of the sea to the summits of the loftiest\r\nmountains. This is the general rule. Sumatra, New Guinea, Borneo, the\r\nPhilippines and the Moluccas, and the uncultivated parts of Java and\r\nCelebes, are all forest countries, except a few small and unimportant\r\ntracts, due perhaps, in some cases, to ancient cultivation or accidental\r\nfires. To this, however, there is one important exception in the island\r\nof Timor and all the smaller islands around it, in which there is\r\nabsolutely no forest such as exists in the other islands, and this\r\ncharacter extends in a lesser degree to Flores, Sumbawa, Lombock, and\r\nBali.\r\n\r\nIn Timor the most common trees are Eucalypti of several species, also\r\ncharacteristic of Australia, with sandalwood, acacia, and other sorts\r\nin less abundance. These are scattered over the country more or less\r\nthickly, but, never so as to deserve the name of a forest. Coarse\r\nand scanty grasses grow beneath them on the more barren hills, and a\r\nluxuriant herbage in the moister localities. In the islands between\r\nTimor and Java there is often a more thickly wooded country abounding\r\nin thorny and prickly trees. These seldom reach any great height, and\r\nduring the force of the dry season they almost completely lose\r\ntheir leaves, allowing the ground beneath them to be parched up, and\r\ncontrasting strongly with the damp, gloomy, ever-verdant forests of the\r\nother islands. This peculiar character, which extends in a less degree\r\nto the southern peninsula of Celebes and the east end of Java, is most\r\nprobably owing to the proximity of Australia. The south-east monsoon,\r\nwhich lasts for about two-thirds of the year (from March to November),\r\nblowing over the northern parts of that country, produces a degree of\r\nheat and dryness which assimilates the vegetation and physical aspect of\r\nthe adjacent islands to its own. A little further eastward in Timor and\r\nthe Ke Islands, a moister climate prevails; the southeast winds blowing\r\nfrom the Pacific through Torres Straits and over the damp forests of New\r\nGuinea, and as a consequence, every rocky islet is clothed with verdure\r\nto its very summit. Further west again, as the same dry winds blow\r\nover a wider and wider extent of ocean, they have time to absorb fresh\r\nmoisture, and we accordingly find the island of Java possessing a less\r\nand less arid climate, until in the extreme west near Batavia, rain\r\noccurs more or less all the year round, and the mountains are everywhere\r\nclothed with forests of unexampled luxuriance.\r\n\r\nContrasts in Depth of Sea.--It was first pointed out by Mr. George\r\nWindsor Earl, in a paper read before the Royal Geographical Society\r\nin 1845, and subsequently in a pamphlet \"On the Physical Geography\r\nof South-Eastern Asia and Australia\", dated 1855, that a shallow sea\r\nconnected the great islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo with the\r\nAsiatic continent, with which their natural productions generally\r\nagreed; while a similar shallow sea connected New Guinea and some of the\r\nadjacent islands to Australia, all being characterised by the presence\r\nof marsupials.\r\n\r\nWe have here a clue to the most radical contrast in the Archipelago, and\r\nby following it out in detail I have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nwe can draw a line among the islands, which shall so divide them that\r\none-half shall truly belong to Asia, while the other shall no less\r\ncertainly be allied to Australia. I term these respectively the\r\nIndo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan divisions of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nOn referring to pages 12, 13, and 36 of Mr. Earl's pamphlet, it will be\r\nseen that he maintains the former connection of Asia and Australia as\r\nan important part of his view; whereas, I dwell mainly on their\r\nlong continued separation. Notwithstanding this and other important\r\ndifferences between us, to him undoubtedly belongs the merit of first\r\nindicating the division of the Archipelago into an Australian and an\r\nAsiatic region, which it has been my good fortune to establish by more\r\ndetailed observations.\r\n\r\nContrasts in Natural Productions.--To understand the importance of this\r\nclass of facts, and its bearing upon the former distribution of land and\r\nsea, it is necessary to consider the results arrived at by geologists\r\nand naturalists in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that the present distribution of living\r\nthings on the surface of the earth is mainly the result of the last\r\nseries of changes that it has undergone. Geology teaches us that\r\nthe surface of the land, and the distribution of land and water, is\r\neverywhere slowly changing. It further teaches us that the forms of life\r\nwhich inhabit that surface have, during every period of which we possess\r\nany record, been also slowly changing.\r\n\r\nIt is not now necessary to say anything about how either of those\r\nchanges took place; as to that, opinions may differ; but as to the fact\r\nthat the changes themselves have occurred, from the earliest geological\r\nages down to the present day, and are still going on, there is no\r\ndifference of opinion. Every successive stratum of sedimentary rock,\r\nsand, or gravel, is a proof that changes of level have taken place; and\r\nthe different species of animals and plants, whose remains are found\r\nin these deposits, prove that corresponding changes did occur in the\r\norganic world.\r\n\r\nTaking, therefore, these two series of changes for granted, most of the\r\npresent peculiarities and anomalies in the distribution of species may\r\nbe directly traced to them. In our own islands, with a very few trifling\r\nexceptions, every quadruped, bird, reptile, insect, and plant, is found\r\nalso on the adjacent continent. In the small islands of Sardinia and\r\nCorsica, there are some quadrupeds and insects, and many plants, quite\r\npeculiar. In Ceylon, more closely connected to India than Britain is to\r\nEurope, many animals and plants are different from those found in India,\r\nand peculiar to the island. In the Galapagos Islands, almost every\r\nindigenous living thing is peculiar to them, though closely resembling\r\nother kinds found in the nearest parts of the American continent.\r\n\r\nMost naturalists now admit that these facts can only be explained by\r\nthe greater or less lapse of time since the islands were upraised from\r\nbeneath the ocean, or were separated from the nearest land; and this\r\nwill be generally (though not always) indicated by the depth of the\r\nintervening sea. The enormous thickness of many marine deposits through\r\nwide areas shows that subsidence has often continued (with intermitting\r\nperiods of repose) during epochs of immense duration. The depth of sea\r\nproduced by such subsidence will therefore generally be a measure of\r\ntime; and in like manner, the change which organic forms have undergone\r\nis a measure of time. When we make proper allowance for the continued\r\nintroduction of new animals and plants from surrounding countries by\r\nthose natural means of dispersal which have been so well explained by\r\nSir Charles Lyell and Mr. Darwin, it is remarkable how closely these two\r\nmeasures correspond. Britain is separated from the continent by a very\r\nshallow sea, and only in a very few cases have our animals or plants\r\nbegun to show a difference from the corresponding continental species.\r\nCorsica and Sardinia, divided from Italy by a much deeper sea, present\r\na much greater difference in their organic forms. Cuba, separated from\r\nYucatan by a wider and deeper strait, differs more markedly, so that\r\nmost of its productions are of distinct and peculiar species; while\r\nMadagascar, divided from Africa by a deep channel three hundred miles\r\nwide, possesses so many peculiar features as to indicate separation at\r\na very remote antiquity, or even to render it doubtful whether the two\r\ncountries have ever been absolutely united.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the Malay Archipelago, we find that all the wide\r\nexpanse of sea which divides Java, Sumatra, and Borneo from each other,\r\nand from Malacca and Siam, is so shallow that ships can anchor in any\r\npart of it, since it rarely exceeds forty fathoms in depth; and if we go\r\nas far as the line of a hundred fathoms, we shall include the Philippine\r\nIslands and Bali, east of Java. If, therefore, these islands have\r\nbeen separated from each other and the continent by subsidence of the\r\nintervening tracts of land, we should conclude that the separation\r\nhas been comparatively recent, since the depth to which the land has\r\nsubsided is so small. It is also to be remarked that the great chain\r\nof active volcanoes in Sumatra and Java furnishes us with a sufficient\r\ncause for such subsidence, since the enormous masses of matter they have\r\nthrown out would take away the foundations of the surrounding district;\r\nand this may be the true explanation of the often-noticed fact that\r\nvolcanoes and volcanic chains are always near the sea. The subsidence\r\nthey produce around them will, in time, make a sea, if one does not\r\nalready exist.\r\n\r\nBut, it is when we examine the zoology of these countries that we find\r\nwhat we most require--evidence of a very striking character that these\r\ngreat islands must have once formed a part of the continent, and could\r\nonly have been separated at a very recent geological epoch. The elephant\r\nand tapir of Sumatra and Borneo, the rhinoceros of Sumatra and the\r\nallied species of Java, the wild cattle of Borneo and the kind long\r\nsupposed to be peculiar to Java, are now all known to inhabit some part\r\nor other of Southern Asia. None of these large animals could possibly\r\nhave passed over the arms of the sea which now separate these countries,\r\nand their presence plainly indicates that a land communication must have\r\nexisted since the origin of the species. Among the smaller mammals, a\r\nconsiderable portion are common to each island and the continent; but\r\nthe vast physical changes that must have occurred during the breaking up\r\nand subsidence of such extensive regions have led to the extinction of\r\nsome in one or more of the islands, and in some cases there seems also\r\nto have been time for a change of species to have taken place. Birds\r\nand insects illustrate the same view, for every family and almost every\r\ngenus of these groups found in any of the islands occurs also on the\r\nAsiatic continent, and in a great number of cases the species are\r\nexactly identical. Birds offer us one of the best means of determining\r\nthe law of distribution; for though at first sight it would appear that\r\nthe watery boundaries which keep out the land quadrupeds could be easily\r\npassed over by birds, yet practically it is not so; for if we leave out\r\nthe aquatic tribes which are pre-eminently wanderers, it is found that\r\nthe others (and especially the Passeres, or true perching-birds, which\r\nform the vast majority) are generally as strictly limited by straits and\r\narms of the sea as are quadrupeds themselves. As an instance, among the\r\nislands of which I am now speaking, it is a remarkable fact that Java\r\npossesses numerous birds which never pass over to Sumatra, though they\r\nare separated by a strait only fifteen miles wide, and with islands in\r\nmid-channel. Java, in fact, possesses more birds and insects peculiar\r\nto itself than either Sumatra or Borneo, and this would indicate that it\r\nwas earliest separated from the continent; next in organic individuality\r\nis Borneo, while Sumatra is so nearly identical in all its animal forms\r\nwith the peninsula of Malacca, that we may safely conclude it to have\r\nbeen the most recently dismembered island.\r\n\r\nThe general result therefore, at which we arrive, is that the great\r\nislands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo resemble in their natural\r\nproductions the adjacent parts of the continent, almost as much as such\r\nwidely-separated districts could be expected to do even if they still\r\nformed a part of Asia; and this close resemblance, joined with the fact\r\nof the wide extent of sea which separates them being so uniformly and\r\nremarkably shallow, and lastly, the existence of the extensive range of\r\nvolcanoes in Sumatra and Java, which have poured out vast quantities\r\nof subterranean matter and have built up extensive plateaux and lofty\r\nmountain ranges, thus furnishing a vera causa for a parallel line of\r\nsubsidence--all lead irresistibly to the conclusion that at a very\r\nrecent geological epoch, the continent of Asia extended far beyond its\r\npresent limits in a south-easterly direction, including the islands of\r\nJava, Sumatra, and Borneo, and probably reaching as far as the present\r\n100-fathom line of soundings.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands agree in many respects with Asia and the other\r\nislands, but present some anomalies, which seem to indicate that they\r\nwere separated at an earlier period, and have since been subject to many\r\nrevolutions in their physical geography.\r\n\r\nTurning our attention now to the remaining portion of the Archipelago,\r\nwe shall find that all the islands from Celebes and Lombock eastward\r\nexhibit almost as close a resemblance to Australia and New Guinea as\r\nthe Western Islands do to Asia. It is well known that the natural\r\nproductions of Australia differ from those of Asia more than those of\r\nany of the four ancient quarters of the world differ from each other.\r\nAustralia, in fact, stands alone: it possesses no apes or monkeys, no\r\ncats or tigers, wolves, bears, or hyenas; no deer or antelopes, sheep or\r\noxen; no elephant, horse, squirrel, or rabbit; none, in short, of those\r\nfamiliar types of quadruped which are met with in every other part\r\nof the world. Instead of these, it has Marsupials only: kangaroos and\r\nopossums; wombats and the duckbilled Platypus. In birds it is almost as\r\npeculiar. It has no woodpeckers and no pheasants--families which\r\nexist in every other part of the world; but instead of them it has the\r\nmound-making brush-turkeys, the honeysuckers, the cockatoos, and the\r\nbrush-tongued lories, which are found nowhere else upon the globe. All\r\nthese striking peculiarities are found also in those islands which form\r\nthe Austro-Malayan division of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe great contrast between the two divisions of the Archipelago is\r\nnowhere so abruptly exhibited as on passing from the island of Bali to\r\nthat of Lombock, where the two regions are in closest proximity. In Bali\r\nwe have barbets, fruit-thrushes, and woodpeckers; on passing over to\r\nLombock these are seen no more, but we have abundance of cockatoos,\r\nhoneysuckers, and brush-turkeys, which are equally unknown in Bali, or\r\nany island further west. [I was informed, however, that there were a\r\nfew cockatoos at one spot on the west of Bali, showing that the\r\nintermingling of the productions of these islands is now going on.] The\r\nstrait is here fifteen miles wide, so that we may pass in two hours from\r\none great division of the earth to another, differing as essentially in\r\ntheir animal life as Europe does from America. If we travel from Java\r\nor Borneo to Celebes or the Moluccas, the difference is still more\r\nstriking. In the first, the forests abound in monkeys of many kinds,\r\nwild cats, deer, civets, and otters, and numerous varieties of squirrels\r\nare constantly met with. In the latter none of these occur; but the\r\nprehensile-tailed Cuscus is almost the only terrestrial mammal seen,\r\nexcept wild pigs, which are found in all the islands, and deer (which\r\nhave probably been recently introduced) in Celebes and the Moluccas. The\r\nbirds which are most abundant in the Western Islands are woodpeckers,\r\nbarbets, trogons, fruit-thrushes, and leaf-thrushes; they are seen\r\ndaily, and form the great ornithological features of the country. In\r\nthe Eastern Islands these are absolutely unknown, honeysuckers and small\r\nlories being the most common birds, so that the naturalist feels himself\r\nin a new world, and can hardly realize that he has passed from the one\r\nregion to the other in a few days, without ever being out of sight of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe inference that we must draw from these facts is, undoubtedly, that\r\nthe whole of the islands eastwards beyond Java and Borneo do essentially\r\nform a part of a former Australian or Pacific continent, although some\r\nof them may never have been actually joined to it. This continent must\r\nhave been broken up not only before the Western Islands were separated\r\nfrom Asia, but probably before the extreme southeastern portion of Asia\r\nwas raised above the waters of the ocean; for a great part of the\r\nland of Borneo and Java is known to be geologically of quite recent\r\nformation, while the very great difference of species, and in many cases\r\nof genera also, between the productions of the Eastern Malay Islands and\r\nAustralia, as well as the great depth of the sea now separating them,\r\nall point to a comparatively long period of isolation.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe among the islands themselves how a shallow\r\nsea always intimates a recent land connexion. The Aru Islands, Mysol,\r\nand Waigiou, as well as Jobie, agree with New Guinea in their species of\r\nmammalia and birds much more closely than they do with the Moluccas,\r\nand we find that they are all united to New Guinea by a shallow sea.\r\nIn fact, the 100-fathom line round New Guinea marks out accurately the\r\nrange of the true Paradise birds.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noted--and this is a very interesting point in\r\nconnection with theories of the dependence of special forms of life\r\non external conditions--that this division of the Archipelago into\r\ntwo regions characterised by a striking diversity in their natural\r\nproductions does not in any way correspond to the main physical or\r\nclimatal divisions of the surface. The great volcanic chain runs through\r\nboth parts, and appears to produce no effect in assimilating their\r\nproductions. Borneo closely resembles New Guinea not only in its vast\r\nsize and its freedom from volcanoes, but in its variety of geological\r\nstructure, its uniformity of climate, and the general aspect of the\r\nforest vegetation that clothes its surface. The Moluccas are the\r\ncounterpart of the Philippines in their volcanic structure, their\r\nextreme fertility, their luxuriant forests, and their frequent\r\nearthquakes; and Bali with the east end of Java has a climate almost\r\nas dry and a soil almost as arid as that of Timor. Yet between these\r\ncorresponding groups of islands, constructed as it were after the same\r\npattern, subjected to the same climate, and bathed by the same oceans,\r\nthere exists the greatest possible contrast when we compare their animal\r\nproductions. Nowhere does the ancient doctrine--that differences\r\nor similarities in the various forms of life that inhabit different\r\ncountries are due to corresponding physical differences or similarities\r\nin the countries themselves--meet with so direct and palpable a\r\ncontradiction. Borneo and New Guinea, as alike physically as two\r\ndistinct countries can be, are zoologically wide as the poles asunder;\r\nwhile Australia, with its dry winds, its open plains, its stony deserts,\r\nand its temperate climate, yet produces birds and quadrupeds which are\r\nclosely related to those inhabiting the hot damp luxuriant forests,\r\nwhich everywhere clothe the plains and mountains of New Guinea.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate more clearly the means by which I suppose this\r\ngreat contrast has been brought about, let us consider what would occur\r\nif two strongly contrasted divisions of the earth were, by natural\r\nmeans, brought into proximity. No two parts of the world differ so\r\nradically in their productions as Asia and Australia, but the difference\r\nbetween Africa and South America is also very great, and these two\r\nregions will well serve to illustrate the question we are considering.\r\nOn the one side we have baboons, lions, elephants, buffaloes, and\r\ngiraffes; on the other spider-monkeys, pumas, tapirs, anteaters,\r\nand sloths; while among birds, the hornbills, turacos, orioles, and\r\nhoneysuckers of Africa contrast strongly with the toucans, macaws,\r\nchatterers, and hummingbirds of America.\r\n\r\nNow let us endeavour to imagine (what it is very probable may occur in\r\nfuture ages) that a slow upheaval of the bed of the Atlantic should take\r\nplace, while at the same time earthquake-shocks and volcanic action on\r\nthe land should cause increased volumes of sediment to be poured down\r\nby the rivers, so that the two continents should gradually spread out by\r\nthe addition of newly-formed lands, and thus reduce the Atlantic which\r\nnow separates them, to an arm of the sea a few hundred miles wide. At\r\nthe same time we may suppose islands to be upheaved in mid-channel; and,\r\nas the subterranean forces varied in intensity, and shifted their points\r\nof greatest action, these islands would sometimes become connected with\r\nthe land on one side or other of the strait, and at other times again be\r\nseparated from it. Several islands would at one time be joined together,\r\nat another would be broken up again, until at last, after many long ages\r\nof such intermittent action, we might have an irregular archipelago\r\nof islands filling up the ocean channel of the Atlantic, in whose\r\nappearance and arrangement we could discover nothing to tell us which\r\nhad been connected with Africa and which with America. The animals and\r\nplants inhabiting these islands would, however, certainly reveal this\r\nportion of their former history. On those islands which had ever formed\r\na part of the South American continent, we should be sure to find such\r\ncommon birds as chatterers and toucans and hummingbirds, and some of the\r\npeculiar American quadrupeds; while on those which had been separated\r\nfrom Africa, hornbills, orioles, and honeysuckers would as certainly be\r\nfound. Some portion of the upraised land might at different times have\r\nhad a temporary connection with both continents, and would then contain\r\na certain amount of mixture in its living inhabitants. Such seems to\r\nhave been the case with the islands of Celebes and the Philippines.\r\nOther islands, again, though in such close proximity as Bali and\r\nLombock, might each exhibit an almost unmixed sample of the productions\r\nof the continents of which they had directly or indirectly once formed a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Archipelago we have, I believe, a case exactly parallel\r\nto that which I have here supposed. We have indications of a vast\r\ncontinent, with a peculiar fauna and flora having been gradually and\r\nirregularly broken up; the island of Celebes probably marking its\r\nfurthest westward extension, beyond which was a wide ocean. At the\r\nsame time Asia appears to have been extending its limits in a southeast\r\ndirection, first in an unbroken mass, then separated into islands as\r\nwe now see it, and almost coming into actual contact with the scattered\r\nfragments of the great southern land.\r\n\r\nFrom this outline of the subject, it will be evident how important an\r\nadjunct Natural History is to Geology; not only in interpreting\r\nthe fragments of extinct animals found in the earth's crust, but in\r\ndetermining past changes in the surface which have left no geological\r\nrecord. It is certainly a wonderful and unexpected fact that an accurate\r\nknowledge of the distribution of birds and insects should enable us to\r\nmap out lands and continents which disappeared beneath the ocean long\r\nbefore the earliest traditions of the human race. Wherever the geologist\r\ncan explore the earth's surface, he can read much of its past history,\r\nand can determine approximately its latest movements above and below the\r\nsea-level; but wherever oceans and seas now extend, he can do nothing\r\nbut speculate on the very limited data afforded by the depth of the\r\nwaters. Here the naturalist steps in, and enables him to fill up this\r\ngreat gap in the past history of the earth.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief objects of my travels was to obtain evidence of this\r\nnature; and my search after such evidence has been rewarded by great\r\nsuccess, so that I have been able to trace out with some probability the\r\npast changes which one of the most interesting parts of the earth has\r\nundergone. It may be thought that the facts and generalizations here\r\ngiven would have been more appropriately placed at the end rather than\r\nat the beginning of a narrative of the travels which supplied the facts.\r\nIn some cases this might be so, but I have found it impossible to give\r\nsuch an account as I desire of the natural history of the numerous\r\nislands and groups of islands in the Archipelago, without constant\r\nreference to these generalizations which add so much to their interest.\r\nHaving given this general sketch of the subject, I shall be able to show\r\nhow the same principles can be applied to the individual islands of a\r\ngroup, as to the whole Archipelago; and thereby make my account of the\r\nmany new and curious animals which inhabit them both, more interesting\r\nand more instructive than if treated as mere isolated facts.\r\n\r\nContrasts of Races.--Before I had arrived at the conviction that the\r\neastern and western halves of the Archipelago belonged to distinct\r\nprimary regions of the earth, I had been led to group the natives of the\r\nArchipelago under two radically distinct races. In this I differed from\r\nmost ethnologists who had before written on the subject; for it had\r\nbeen the almost universal custom to follow William von Humboldt and\r\nPritchard, in classing all the Oceanic races as modifications of one\r\ntype. Observation soon showed me, however, that Malays and Papuans\r\ndiffered radically in every physical, mental, and moral character; and\r\nmore detailed research, continued for eight years, satisfied me that\r\nunder these two forms, as types, the whole of the peoples of the Malay\r\nArchipelago and Polynesia could be classified. On drawing the line which\r\nseparates these races, it is found to come near to that which divides\r\nthe zoological regions, but somewhat eastward of it; a circumstance\r\nwhich appears to me very significant of the same causes having\r\ninfluenced the distribution of mankind that have determined the range of\r\nother animal forms.\r\n\r\nThe reason why exactly the same line does not limit both is sufficiently\r\nintelligible. Man has means of traversing the sea which animals do not\r\npossess; and a superior race has power to press out or assimilate an\r\ninferior one. The maritime enterprise and higher civilization of the\r\nMalay races have enabled them to overrun a portion of the adjacent\r\nregion, in which they have entirely supplanted the indigenous\r\ninhabitants if it ever possessed any; and to spread much of their\r\nlanguage, their domestic animals, and their customs far over the\r\nPacific, into islands where they have but slightly, or not at all,\r\nmodified the physical or moral characteristics of the people.\r\n\r\nI believe, therefore, that all the peoples of the various islands can be\r\ngrouped either with the Malays or the Papuans; and that these two have\r\nno traceable affinity to each other. I believe, further, that all the\r\nraces east of the line I have drawn have more affinity for each other\r\nthan they have for any of the races west of that line; that, in fact,\r\nthe Asiatic races include the Malays, and all have a continental origin,\r\nwhile the Pacific races, including all to the east of the former\r\n(except perhaps some in the Northern Pacific), are derived, not from\r\nany existing continent, but from lands which now exist or have recently\r\nexisted in the Pacific Ocean. These preliminary observations will enable\r\nthe reader better to apprehend the importance I attach to the details of\r\nphysical form or moral character, which I shall give in describing the\r\ninhabitants of many of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. SINGAPORE.\r\n\r\n (A SKETCH OF THE TOWN AND ISLAND AS SEEN DURING SEVERAL VISITS FROM 1854 TO 1862.)\r\n\r\nFEW places are more interesting to a traveller from Europe than the town\r\nand island of Singapore, furnishing, as it does, examples of a variety\r\nof Eastern races, and of many different religions and modes of life. The\r\ngovernment, the garrison, and the chief merchants are English; but\r\nthe great mass of the population is Chinese, including some of the\r\nwealthiest merchants, the agriculturists of the interior, and most of\r\nthe mechanics and labourers. The native Malays are usually fishermen and\r\nboatmen, and they form the main body of the police. The Portuguese of\r\nMalacca supply a large number of the clerks and smaller merchants. The\r\nKlings of Western India are a numerous body of Mahometans, and,\r\nwith many Arabs, are petty merchants and shopkeepers. The grooms and\r\nwashermen are all Bengalees, and there is a small but highly respectable\r\nclass of Parsee merchants. Besides these, there are numbers of Javanese\r\nsailors and domestic servants, as well as traders from Celebes, Bali,\r\nand many other islands of the Archipelago. The harbour is crowded with\r\nmen-of-war and trading vessels of many European nations, and hundreds\r\nof Malay praus and Chinese junks, from vessels of several hundred tons\r\nburthen down to little fishing boats and passenger sampans; and the town\r\ncomprises handsome public buildings and churches, Mahometan mosques,\r\nHindu temples, Chinese joss-houses, good European houses, massive\r\nwarehouses, queer old Kling and China bazaars, and long suburbs of\r\nChinese and Malay cottages.\r\n\r\nBy far the most conspicuous of the various kinds of people in Singapore,\r\nand those which most attract the stranger's attention, are the Chinese,\r\nwhose numbers and incessant activity give the place very much the\r\nappearance of a town in China. The Chinese merchant is generally a fat\r\nround-faced man with an important and business-like look. He wears the\r\nsame style of clothing (loose white smock, and blue or black trousers)\r\nas the meanest coolie, but of finer materials, and is always clean and\r\nneat; and his long tail tipped with red silk hangs down to his heels.\r\nHe has a handsome warehouse or shop in town and a good house in the\r\ncountry. He keeps a fine horse and gig, and every evening may be seen\r\ntaking a drive bareheaded to enjoy the cool breeze. He is rich--he\r\nowns several retail shops and trading schooners, he lends money at high\r\ninterest and on good security, he makes hard bargains, and gets fatter\r\nand richer every year.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese bazaar are hundreds of small shops in which a\r\nmiscellaneous collection of hardware and dry goods are to be found, and\r\nwhere many things are sold wonderfully cheap. You may buy gimlets at\r\na penny each, white cotton thread at four balls for a halfpenny, and\r\npenknives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and many other\r\narticles as cheap or cheaper than you can purchase them in England. The\r\nshopkeeper is very good-natured; he will show you everything he has, and\r\ndoes not seem to mind if you buy nothing. He bates a little, but not so\r\nmuch as the Klings, who almost always ask twice what they are willing to\r\ntake. If you buy a few things from him, he will speak to you afterwards\r\nevery time you pass his shop, asking you to walk in and sit down, or\r\ntake a cup of tea; and you wonder how he can get a living where so many\r\nsell the same trifling articles.\r\n\r\nThe tailors sit at a table, not on one; and both they and the shoemakers\r\nwork well and cheaply. The barbers have plenty to do, shaving heads and\r\ncleaning ears; for which latter operation they have a great array of\r\nlittle tweezers, picks, and brushes. In the outskirts of the town are\r\nscores of carpenters and blacksmiths. The former seem chiefly to make\r\ncoffins and highly painted and decorated clothes-boxes. The latter are\r\nmostly gun-makers, and bore the barrels of guns by hand out of solid\r\nbars of iron. At this tedious operation they may be seen every day, and\r\nthey manage to finish off a gun with a flintlock very handsomely. All\r\nabout the streets are sellers of water, vegetables, fruit, soup,\r\nand agar-agar (a jelly made of seaweed), who have many cries\r\nas unintelligible as those of London. Others carry a portable\r\ncooking-apparatus on a pole balanced by a table at the other end, and\r\nserve up a meal of shellfish, rice, and vegetables for two or three\r\nhalfpence--while coolies and boatmen waiting to be hired are everywhere\r\nto be met with.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the island the Chinese cut down forest trees in the\r\njungle, and saw them up into planks; they cultivate vegetables, which\r\nthey bring to market; and they grow pepper and gambir, which form\r\nimportant articles of export. The French Jesuits have established\r\nmissions among these inland Chinese, which seem very successful. I lived\r\nfor several weeks at a time with the missionary at Bukit-tima, about the\r\ncentre of the island, where a pretty church has been built and there are\r\nabout 300 converts. While there, I met a missionary who had just arrived\r\nfrom Tonquin, where he had been living for many years. The Jesuits still\r\ndo their work thoroughly as of old. In Cochin China, Tonquin, and China,\r\nwhere all Christian teachers are obliged to live in secret, and\r\nare liable to persecution, expulsion, and sometimes death, every\r\nprovince--even those farthest in the interior--has a permanent Jesuit\r\nmission establishment constantly kept up by fresh aspirants, who are\r\ntaught the languages of the countries they are going to at Penang or\r\nSingapore. In China there are said to be near a million converts; in\r\nTonquin and Cochin China, more than half a million. One secret of\r\nthe success of these missions is the rigid economy practised in the\r\nexpenditure of the funds. A missionary is allowed about £30. a year, on\r\nwhich he lives in whatever country he may be. This renders it possible\r\nto support a large number of missionaries with very limited means; and\r\nthe natives, seeing their teachers living in poverty and with none of\r\nthe luxuries of life, are convinced that they are sincere in what they\r\nteach, and have really given up home and friends and ease and safety,\r\nfor the good of others. No wonder they make converts, for it must be a\r\ngreat blessing to the poor people among whom they labour to have a man\r\namong them to whom they can go in any trouble or distress, who will\r\ncomfort and advise them, who visits them in sickness, who relieves\r\nthem in want, and who they see living from day-to-day in danger of\r\npersecution and death--entirely for their sakes.\r\n\r\nMy friend at Bukit-tima was truly a father to his flock. He preached\r\nto them in Chinese every Sunday, and had evenings for discussion and\r\nconversation on religion during the week. He had a school to teach their\r\nchildren. His house was open to them day and night. If a man came to him\r\nand said, \"I have no rice for my family to eat today,\" he would give\r\nhim half of what he had in the house, however little that might be. If\r\nanother said, \"I have no money to pay my debt,\" he would give him half\r\nthe contents of his purse, were it his last dollar. So, when he was\r\nhimself in want, he would send to some of the wealthiest among his\r\nflock, and say, \"I have no rice in the house,\" or \"I have given away my\r\nmoney, and am in want of such and such articles.\" The result was that\r\nhis flock trusted and loved him, for they felt sure that he was their\r\ntrue friend, and had no ulterior designs in living among them.\r\n\r\nThe island of Singapore consists of a multitude of small hills, three or\r\nfour hundred feet high, the summits of many of which are still covered\r\nwith virgin forest. The mission-house at Bukit-tima was surrounded\r\nby several of these wood-topped hills, which were much frequented by\r\nwoodcutters and sawyers, and offered me an excellent collecting ground\r\nfor insects. Here and there, too, were tiger pits, carefully covered\r\nover with sticks and leaves, and so well concealed, that in several\r\ncases I had a narrow escape from falling into them. They are shaped\r\nlike an iron furnace, wider at the bottom than the top, and are perhaps\r\nfifteen or twenty feet deep so that it would be almost impossible for\r\na person unassisted to get out of one. Formerly a sharp stake was stuck\r\nerect in the bottom; but after an unfortunate traveller had been killed\r\nby falling on one, its use was forbidden. There are always a few tigers\r\nroaming about Singapore, and they kill on an average a Chinaman every\r\nday, principally those who work in the gambir plantations, which are\r\nalways made in newly-cleared jungle. We heard a tiger roar once or twice\r\nin the evening, and it was rather nervous work hunting for insects among\r\nthe fallen trunks and old sawpits when one of these savage animals might\r\nbe lurking close by, awaiting an opportunity to spring upon us.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours in the middle of every fine day were spent in these\r\npatches of forest, which were delightfully cool and shady by contrast\r\nwith the bare open country we had to walk over to reach them. The\r\nvegetation was most luxuriant, comprising enormous forest trees, as well\r\nas a variety of ferns, caladiums, and other undergrowth, and abundance\r\nof climbing rattan palms. Insects were exceedingly abundant and very\r\ninteresting, and every day furnished scores of new and curious forms.\r\n\r\nIn about two months I obtained no less than 700 species of beetles,\r\na large proportion of which were quite new, and among them were 130\r\ndistinct kinds of the elegant Longicorns (Cerambycidae), so much\r\nesteemed by collectors. Almost all these were collected in one patch of\r\njungle, not more than a square mile in extent, and in all my subsequent\r\ntravels in the East I rarely if ever met with so productive a spot. This\r\nexceeding productiveness was due in part no doubt to some favourable\r\nconditions in the soil, climate, and vegetation, and to the season being\r\nvery bright and sunny, with sufficient showers to keep everything\r\nfresh. But it was also in a great measure dependent, I feel sure, on\r\nthe labours of the Chinese wood-cutters. They had been at work here for\r\nseveral years, and during all that time had furnished a continual supply\r\nof dry and dead and decaying leaves and bark, together with abundance of\r\nwood and sawdust, for the nourishment of insects and their larvae. This\r\nhad led to the assemblage of a great variety of species in a limited\r\nspace, and I was the first naturalist who had come to reap the harvest\r\nthey had prepared. In the same place, and during my walks in other\r\ndirections, I obtained a fair collection of butterflies and of other\r\norders of insects, so that on the whole I was quite satisfied with\r\nthese--my first attempts to gain a knowledge of the Natural History of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. MALACCA AND MOUNT OPHIR.\r\n\r\n (JULY TO SEPTEMBER, 1854.)\r\n\r\nBIRDS and most other kinds of animals being scarce at Singapore, I\r\nleft it in July for Malacca, where I spent more than two months in the\r\ninterior, and made an excursion to Mount Ophir. The old and picturesque\r\ntown of Malacca is crowded along the banks of the small river, and\r\nconsists of narrow streets of shops and dwelling houses, occupied by the\r\ndescendants of the Portuguese, and by Chinamen. In the suburbs are\r\nthe houses of the English officials and of a few Portuguese merchants,\r\nembedded in groves of palms and fruit-trees, whose varied and beautiful\r\nfoliage furnishes a pleasing relief to the eye, as well as most grateful\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nThe old fort, the large Government House, and the ruins of a cathedral\r\nattest the former wealth and importance of this place, which was once\r\nas much the centre of Eastern trade as Singapore is now. The following\r\ndescription of it by Linschott, who wrote two hundred and seventy years\r\nago, strikingly exhibits the change it has undergone:\r\n\r\n\"Malacca is inhabited by the Portuguese and by natives of the country,\r\ncalled Malays. The Portuguese have here a fortress, as at Mozambique,\r\nand there is no fortress in all the Indies, after those of Mozambique\r\nand Ormuz, where the captains perform their duty better than in this\r\none. This place is the market of all India, of China, of the Moluccas,\r\nand of other islands around about--from all which places, as well\r\nas from Banda, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Pegu, Bengal, Coromandel, and\r\nIndia--arrive ships which come and go incessantly, charged with an\r\ninfinity of merchandises. There would be in this place a much greater\r\nnumber of Portuguese if it were not for the inconvenience, and\r\nunhealthiness of the air, which is hurtful not only to strangers, but\r\nalso to natives of the country. Thence it is that all who live in the\r\ncountry pay tribute of their health, suffering from a certain disease,\r\nwhich makes them lose either their skin or their hair. And those who\r\nescape consider it a miracle, which occasions many to leave the country,\r\nwhile the ardent desire of gain induces others to risk their health, and\r\nendeavour to endure such an atmosphere. The origin of this town, as the\r\nnatives say, was very small, only having at the beginning, by reason of\r\nthe unhealthiness of the air, but six or seven fishermen who inhabited\r\nit. But the number was increased by the meeting of fishermen from Siam,\r\nPegu, and Bengal, who came and built a city, and established a peculiar\r\nlanguage, drawn from the most elegant modes of speaking of other\r\nnations, so that in fact the language of the Malays is at present the\r\nmost refined, exact, and celebrated of all the East. The name of Malacca\r\nwas given to this town, which, by the convenience of its situation, in\r\na short time grew to such wealth, that it does not yield to the most\r\npowerful towns and regions around about. The natives, both men and\r\nwomen, are very courteous and are reckoned the most skillful in the\r\nworld in compliments, and study much to compose and repeat verses and\r\nlove-songs. Their language is in vogue through the Indies, as the French\r\nis here.\"\r\n\r\nAt present, a vessel over a hundred tons hardly ever enters its port,\r\nand the trade is entirely confined to a few petty products of the\r\nforests, and to the fruit, which the trees, planted by the old\r\nPortuguese, now produce for the enjoyment of the inhabitants of\r\nSingapore. Although rather subject to fevers, it is not at present\r\nconsidered very unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThe population of Malacca consists of several races. The ubiquitous\r\nChinese are perhaps the most numerous, keeping up their manners,\r\ncustoms, and language; the indigenous Malays are next in point of\r\nnumbers, and their language is the Lingua-franca of the place. Next come\r\nthe descendants of the Portuguese--a mixed, degraded, and degenerate\r\nrace, but who still keep up the use of their mother tongue, though\r\nruefully mutilated in grammar; and then there are the English rulers,\r\nand the descendants of the Dutch, who all speak English. The Portuguese\r\nspoken at Malacca is a useful philological phenomenon. The verbs have\r\nmostly lost their inflections, and one form does for all moods, tenses,\r\nnumbers, and persons. Eu vai, serves for \"I go,\" \"I went,\" or, \"I will\r\ngo.\" Adjectives, too, have been deprived of their feminine and\r\nplural terminations, so that the language is reduced to a marvellous\r\nsimplicity, and, with the admixture of a few Malay words, becomes rather\r\npuzzling to one who has heard only the pure Lusitanian.\r\n\r\nIn costume these several peoples are as varied as in their speech. The\r\nEnglish preserve the tight-fitting coat, waistcoat, and trousers, and\r\nthe abominable hat and cravat; the Portuguese patronise a light jacket,\r\nor, more frequently, shirt and trousers only; the Malays wear their\r\nnational jacket and sarong (a kind of kilt), with loose drawers; while\r\nthe Chinese never depart in the least from their national dress, which,\r\nindeed, it is impossible to improve for a tropical climate, whether as\r\nregards comfort or appearance. The loosely-hanging trousers, and neat\r\nwhite half-shirt half-jacket, are exactly what a dress should be in this\r\nlow latitude.\r\n\r\nI engaged two Portuguese to accompany me into the interior; one as\r\na cook, the other to shoot and skin birds, which is quite a trade in\r\nMalacca. I first stayed a fortnight at a village called Gading, where\r\nI was accommodated in the house of some Chinese converts, to whom I was\r\nrecommended by the Jesuit missionaries. The house was a mere shed, but\r\nit was kept clean, and I made myself sufficiently comfortable. My\r\nhosts were forming a pepper and gambir plantation, and in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood were extensive tin-washings, employing over a thousand\r\nChinese. The tin is obtained in the form of black grains from beds of\r\nquartzose sand, and is melted into ingots in rude clay furnaces. The\r\nsoil seemed poor, and the forest was very dense with undergrowth, and\r\nnot at all productive of insects; but, on the other hand, birds were\r\nabundant, and I was at once introduced to the rich ornithological\r\ntreasures of the Malayan region.\r\n\r\nThe very first time I fired my gun I brought down one of the most\r\ncurious and beautiful of the Malacca birds, the blue-billed gaper\r\n(Cymbirhynchus macrorhynchus), called by the Malays the \"Rainbird.\" It\r\nis about the size of a starling, black and rich claret colour with\r\nwhite shoulder stripes, and a very large and broad bill of the most pure\r\ncobalt blue above and orange below, while the iris is emerald green.\r\nAs the skins dry the bill turns dull black, but even then the bird is\r\nhandsome. When fresh killed, the contrast of the vivid blue with the\r\nrich colours of the plumage is remarkably striking and beautiful.\r\nThe lovely Eastern trogons, with their rich-brown backs, beautifully\r\npencilled wings, and crimson breasts, were also soon obtained, as well\r\nas the large green barbets (Megalaema versicolor)--fruit-eating birds,\r\nsomething like small toucans, with a short, straight bristly bill, and\r\nwhose head and neck are variegated with patches of the most vivid blue\r\nand crimson. A day or two after, my hunter brought me a specimen of\r\nthe green gaper (Calyptomena viridis), which is like a small\r\ncock-of-the-rock, but entirely of the most vivid green, delicately\r\nmarked on the wings with black bars. Handsome woodpeckers and gay\r\nkingfishers, green and brown cuckoos with velvety red faces and green\r\nbeaks, red-breasted doves and metallic honeysuckers, were brought in day\r\nafter day, and kept me in a continual state of pleasurable excitement.\r\nAfter a fortnight one of my servants was seized with fever, and on\r\nreturning to Malacca, the same disease, attacked the other as well as\r\nmyself. By a liberal use of quinine, I soon recovered, and obtaining\r\nother men, went to stay at the Government bungalow of Ayer-panas,\r\naccompanied by a young gentleman, a native of the place, who had a taste\r\nfor natural history.\r\n\r\nAt Ayer-panas we had a comfortable house to stay in, and plenty of\r\nroom to dry and preserve our specimens; but, owing to there being no\r\nindustrious Chinese to cut down timber, insects were comparatively\r\nscarce, with the exception of butterflies, of which I formed a very fine\r\ncollection. The manner in which I obtained one fine insect was curious,\r\nand indicates how fragmentary and imperfect a traveller's collection\r\nmust necessarily be. I was one afternoon walking along a favourite road\r\nthrough the forest, with my gun, when I saw a butterfly on the ground.\r\nIt was large, handsome, and quite new to me, and I got close to it\r\nbefore it flew away. I then observed that it had been settling on the\r\ndung of some carnivorous animal. Thinking it might return to the same\r\nspot, I next day after breakfast took my net, and as I approached the\r\nplace was delighted to see the same butterfly sitting on the same piece\r\nof dung, and succeeded in capturing it. It was an entirely new species\r\nof great beauty, and has been named by Mr. Hewitson--Nymphalis calydona.\r\nI never saw another specimen of it, and it was only after twelve years\r\nhad elapsed that a second individual reached this country from the\r\nnorthwestern part of Borneo.\r\n\r\nHaving determined to visit Mount Ophir, which is situated in the middle\r\nof the peninsula about fifty miles east of Malacca, we engaged six\r\nMalays to accompany us and carry our baggage. As we meant to stay at\r\nleast a week at the mountain, we took with us a good supply of rice, a\r\nlittle biscuit, butter and coffee, some dried fish and a little brandy,\r\nwith blankets, a change of clothes, insect and bird boxes, nets, guns\r\nand ammunition. The distance from Ayer-panas was supposed to be about\r\nthirty miles.\r\n\r\nOur first day's march lay through patches of forest, clearings, and\r\nMalay villages, and was pleasant enough. At night we slept at the house\r\nof a Malay chief, who lent us a verandah, and gave us a fowl and some\r\neggs. The next day the country got wilder and more hilly. We passed\r\nthrough extensive forests, along paths often up to our knees in mud,\r\nand were much annoyed by the leeches for which this district is famous.\r\nThese little creatures infest the leaves and herbage by the side of the\r\npaths, and when a passenger comes along they stretch themselves out at\r\nfull length, and if they touch any part of his dress or body, quit their\r\nleaf and adhere to it. They then creep on to his feet, legs, or other\r\npart of his body and suck their fill, the first puncture being rarely\r\nfelt during the excitement of walking. On bathing in the evening we\r\ngenerally found half a dozen or a dozen on each of us, most frequently\r\non our legs, but sometimes on our bodies, and I had one who sucked his\r\nfill from the side of my neck, but who luckily missed the jugular vein.\r\nThere are many species of these forest leeches. All are small, but some\r\nare beautifully marked with stripes of bright yellow. They probably\r\nattach themselves to deer or other animals which frequent the forest\r\npaths, and have thus acquired the singular habit of stretching\r\nthemselves out at the sound of a footstep or of rustling foliage. Early\r\nin the afternoon we reached the foot of the mountain, and encamped by\r\nthe side of a fine stream, whose rocky banks were overgrown with\r\nferns. Our oldest Malay had been accustomed to shoot birds in this\r\nneighbourhood for the Malacca dealers, and had been to the top of the\r\nmountain, and while we amused ourselves shooting and insect hunting, he\r\nwent with two others to clear the path for our ascent the next day.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we started after breakfast, carrying blankets and\r\nprovisions, as we intended to sleep upon the mountain. After passing\r\na little tangled jungle and swampy thickets through which our men had\r\ncleared a path, we emerged into a fine lofty forest pretty clear of\r\nundergrowth, and in which we could walk freely. We ascended steadily up\r\na moderate slope for several miles, having a deep ravine on our left.\r\nWe then had a level plateau or shoulder to cross, after which the\r\nascent was steeper and the forest denser until we came out upon the\r\n\"Padang-batu,\" or stone field, a place of which we had heard much, but\r\ncould never get anyone to describe intelligibly. We found it to be a\r\nsteep slope of even rock, extending along the mountain side farther than\r\nwe could see. Parts of it were quite bare, but where it was cracked and\r\nfissured there grew a most luxuriant vegetation, among which the pitcher\r\nplants were the most remarkable. These wonderful plants never seem to\r\nsucceed well in our hot-houses, and are there seen to little advantage.\r\nHere they grew up into half climbing shrubs, their curious pitchers\r\nof various sizes and forms hanging abundantly from their leaves, and\r\ncontinually exciting our admiration by their size and beauty. A few\r\nconiferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared, and in the\r\nthickets just above the rocky surface we walked through groves of those\r\nsplendid ferns Dipteris Horsfieldii and Matonia pectinata, which bear\r\nlarge spreading palmate fronds on slender stems six or eight feet high.\r\nThe Matonia is the tallest and most elegant, and is known only from this\r\nmountain, and neither of them is yet introduced into our hot-houses.\r\n\r\nIt was very striking to come out from the dark, cool, and shady forest\r\nin which we had been ascending since we started, on to this hot, open\r\nrocky slope where we seemed to have entered at one step from a lowland\r\nto an alpine vegetation. The height, as measured by a sympiesometer, was\r\nabout 2,800 feet. We had been told we should find water at Padang-batu\r\nas we were exceedingly thirsty; but we looked about for it in vain. At\r\nlast we turned to the pitcher-plants, but the water contained in the\r\npitchers (about half a pint in each) was full of insects, and otherwise\r\nuninviting. On tasting it, however, we found it very palatable though\r\nrather warm, and we all quenched our thirst from these natural jugs.\r\nFarther on we came to forest again, but of a more dwarf and stunted\r\ncharacter than below; and alternately passing along ridges and\r\ndescending into valleys, we reached a peak separated from the true\r\nsummit of the mountain by a considerable chasm. Here our porters gave\r\nin, and declared they could carry their loads no further; and certainly\r\nthe ascent to the highest peak was very precipitous. But on the spot\r\nwhere we were there was no water, whereas it was well known that there\r\nwas a spring close to the summit, so we determined to go on without\r\nthem, and carry with us only what was absolutely necessary. We\r\naccordingly took a blanket each, and divided our food and other articles\r\namong us, and went on with only the old Malay and his son.\r\n\r\nAfter descending into the saddle between the two peaks we found the\r\nascent very laborious, the slope being so steep, as often to necessitate\r\nhand-climbing. Besides a bushy vegetation the ground was covered\r\nknee-deep with mosses on a foundation of decaying leaves and rugged\r\nrock, and it was a hard hour's climb to the small ledge just below the\r\nsummit, where an overhanging rock forms a convenient shelter, and a\r\nlittle basin collects the trickling water. Here we put down our loads,\r\nand in a few minutes more stood on the summit of Mount Ophir, 4,000\r\nfeet above the sea. The top is a small rocky platform covered with\r\nrhododendrons and other shrubs. The afternoon was clear, and the view\r\nfine in its way--ranges of hill and valley everywhere covered with\r\ninterminable forest, with glistening rivers winding among them.\r\n\r\nIn a distant view a forest country is very monotonous, and no mountain I\r\nhave ever ascended in the tropics presents a panorama equal to that from\r\nSnowdon, while the views in Switzerland are immeasurably superior.\r\nWhen boiling our coffee I took observations with a good boiling-point\r\nthermometer, as well as with the sympiesometer, and we then enjoyed our\r\nevening meal and the noble prospect that lay before us. The night was\r\ncalm and very mild, and having made a bed of twigs and branches over\r\nwhich we laid our blankets, we passed a very comfortable night. Our\r\nporters had followed us after a rest, bringing only their rice to cook,\r\nand luckily we did not require the baggage they left behind them. In the\r\nmorning I caught a few butterflies and beetles, and my friend got a few\r\nland-shells; and we then descended, bringing with us some specimens of\r\nthe ferns and pitcher-plants of Padang-batu.\r\n\r\nThe place where we had first encamped at the foot of the mountain being\r\nvery gloomy, we chose another in a kind of swamp near a stream overgrown\r\nwith Zingiberaceous plants, in which a clearing was easily made. Here\r\nour men built two little huts without sides that would just shelter us\r\nfrom the rain; we lived in them for a week, shooting and insect-hunting,\r\nand roaming about the forests at the foot of the mountain. This was the\r\ncountry of the great Argus pheasant, and we continually heard its cry.\r\nOn asking the old Malay to try and shoot one for me, he told me that\r\nalthough he had been for twenty years shooting birds in these forests he\r\nhad never yet shot one, and had never even seen one except after it had\r\nbeen caught. The bird is so exceedingly shy and wary, and runs along\r\nthe ground in the densest parts of the forest so quickly, that it is\r\nimpossible to get near it; and its sober colours and rich eye-like\r\nspots, which are so ornamental when seen in a museum, must harmonize\r\nwell with the dead leaves among which it dwells, and render it very\r\ninconspicuous. All the specimens sold in Malacca are caught in snares,\r\nand my informant, though he had shot none, had snared plenty.\r\n\r\nThe tiger and rhinoceros are still found here, and a few years ago\r\nelephants abounded, but they have lately all disappeared. We found some\r\nheaps of dung, which seemed to be that of elephants, and some tracks of\r\nthe rhinoceros, but saw none of the animals. However, we kept a fire up\r\nall night in case any of these creatures should visit us, and two of our\r\nmen declared that they did one day see a rhinoceros. When our rice was\r\nfinished, and our boxes full of specimens, we returned to Ayer-Panas,\r\nand a few days afterwards went on to Malacca, and thence to Singapore.\r\nMount Ophir has quite a reputation for fever, and all our friends were\r\nastonished at our recklessness in staying so long at its foot; but none\r\nof us suffered in the least, and I shall ever look back with pleasure\r\nto my trip as being my first introduction to mountain scenery in the\r\nEastern tropics.\r\n\r\nThe meagreness and brevity of the sketch I have here given of my visit\r\nto Singapore and the Malay Peninsula is due to my having trusted chiefly\r\nto some private letters and a notebook, which were lost; and to a paper\r\non Malacca and Mount Ophir which was sent to the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, but which was neither read nor printed owing to press of matter\r\nat the end of a session, and the MSS. of which cannot now be found. I\r\nthe less regret this, however, as so many works have been written on\r\nthese parts; and I always intended to pass lightly over my travels in\r\nthe western and better known portions of the Archipelago, in order to\r\ndevote more space to the remoter districts, about which hardly anything\r\nhas been written in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. BORNEO--THE ORANGUTAN.\r\n\r\nI ARRIVED at Sarawak on November 1st, 1854, and left it on January 25th,\r\n1856. In the interval I resided at many different localities, and saw\r\na good deal of the Dyak tribes as well as of the Bornean Malays. I\r\nwas hospitably entertained by Sir James Brooke, and lived in his house\r\nwhenever I was at the town of Sarawak in the intervals of my journeys.\r\nBut so many books have been written about this part of Borneo since I\r\nwas there, that I shall avoid going into details of what I saw and heard\r\nand thought of Sarawak and its ruler, confining myself chiefly to my\r\nexperiences as a naturalist in search of shells, insects, birds and the\r\nOrangutan, and to an account of a journey through a part of the interior\r\nseldom visited by Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe first four months of my visit were spent in various parts of\r\nthe Sarawak River, from Santubong at its mouth up to the picturesque\r\nlimestone mountains and Chinese gold-fields of Bow and Bede. This part\r\nof the country has been so frequently described that I shall pass it\r\nover, especially as, owing to its being the height of the wet season, my\r\ncollections were comparatively poor and insignificant.\r\n\r\nIn March 1865 I determined to go to the coalworks which were being\r\nopened near the Simunjon River, a small branch of the Sadong, a river\r\neast of Sarawak and between it and the Batang-Lupar. The Simunjon enters\r\nthe Sadong River about twenty miles up. It is very narrow and very\r\nwinding, and much overshadowed by the lofty forest, which sometimes\r\nalmost meets over it. The whole country between it and the sea is a\r\nperfectly level forest-covered swamp, out of which rise a few isolated\r\nhills, at the foot of one of which the works are situated. From the\r\nlanding-place to the hill a Dyak road had been formed, which consisted\r\nsolely of tree-trunks laid end to end. Along these the barefooted\r\nnatives walk and carry heavy burdens with the greatest ease, but to a\r\nbooted European it is very slippery work, and when one's attention is\r\nconstantly attracted by the various objects of interest around, a few\r\ntumbles into the bog are almost inevitable. During my first walk along\r\nthis road I saw few insects or birds, but noticed some very handsome\r\norchids in flower, of the genus Coelogyne, a group which I afterwards\r\nfound to be very abundant, and characteristic of the district. On the\r\nslope of the hill near its foot a patch of forest had been cleared away,\r\nand several rude houses erected, in which were residing Mr. Coulson\r\nthe engineer, and a number of Chinese workmen. I was at first kindly\r\naccommodated in Mr. Coulson's house, but finding the spot very suitable\r\nfor me and offering great facilities for collecting, I had a small house\r\nof two rooms and a verandah built for myself. Here I remained nearly\r\nnine months, and made an immense collection of insects, to which class\r\nof animals I devoted my chief attention, owing to the circumstances\r\nbeing especially favourable.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics a large proportion of the insects of all orders, and\r\nespecially of the large and favourite group of beetles, are more or less\r\ndependent on vegetation, and particularly on timber, bark, and leaves\r\nin various stages of decay. In the untouched virgin forest, the insects\r\nwhich frequent such situations are scattered over an immense extent of\r\ncountry, at spots where trees have fallen through decay and old age, or\r\nhave succumbed to the fury of the tempest; and twenty square miles of\r\ncountry may not contain so many fallen and decayed trees as are to be\r\nfound in any small clearing. The quantity and the variety of beetles\r\nand of many other insects that can be collected at a given time in any\r\ntropical locality, will depend, first upon the immediate vicinity of a\r\ngreat extent of virgin forest, and secondly upon the quantity of trees\r\nthat for some months past have been, and which are still being cut down,\r\nand left to dry and decay upon the ground.\r\n\r\nNow, during my whole twelve years' collecting in the western and eastern\r\ntropics, I never enjoyed such advantages in this respect as at the\r\nSimunjon coalworks. For several months from twenty to fifty Chinamen and\r\nDyaks were employed almost exclusively in clearing a large space in the\r\nforest, and in making a wide opening for a railroad to the Sadong River,\r\ntwo miles distant. Besides this, sawpits were established at various\r\npoints in the jungle, and large trees were felled to be cut up into\r\nbeams and planks. For hundreds of miles in every direction a magnificent\r\nforest extended over plain and mountain, rock and morass, and I arrived\r\nat the spot just as the rains began to diminish and the daily sunshine\r\nto increase; a time which I have always found the most favourable season\r\nfor collecting. The number of openings, sunny places, and pathways were\r\nalso an attraction to wasps and butterflies; and by paying a cent each\r\nfor all insects that were brought me, I obtained from the Dyaks and the\r\nChinamen many fine locusts and Phasmidae, as well as numbers of handsome\r\nbeetles.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the mines, on the 14th of March, I had collected in\r\nthe four preceding months, 320 different kinds of beetles. In less\r\nthan a fortnight I had doubled this number, an average of about 24 new\r\nspecies every day. On one day I collected 76 different kinds, of which\r\n34 were new to me. By the end of April I had more than a thousand\r\nspecies, and they then went on increasing at a slower rate, so that\r\nI obtained altogether in Borneo about two thousand distinct kinds,\r\nof which all but about a hundred were collected at this place, and on\r\nscarcely more than a square mile of ground. The most numerous and most\r\ninteresting groups of beetles were the Longicorns and Rhynchophora, both\r\npre-eminently wood-feeders. The former, characterised by their graceful\r\nforms and long antenna, were especially numerous, amounting to nearly\r\nthree hundred species, nine-tenths of which were entirely new, and many\r\nof them remarkable for their large size, strange forms, and beautiful\r\ncolouring. The latter correspond to our weevils and allied groups, and\r\nin the tropics are exceedingly numerous and varied, often swarming upon\r\ndead timber, so that I sometimes obtained fifty or sixty different kinds\r\nin a day. My Bornean collections of this group exceeded five hundred\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nMy collection of butterflies was not large; but I obtained some rare\r\nand very handsome insects, the most remarkable being the Ornithoptera\r\nBrookeana, one of the most elegant species known. This beautiful\r\ncreature has very long and pointed wings, almost resembling a sphinx\r\nmoth in shape. It is deep velvety black, with a curved band of spots of\r\na brilliant metallic-green colour extending across the wings from tip to\r\ntip, each spot being shaped exactly like a small triangular feather, and\r\nhaving very much the effect of a row of the wing coverts of the Mexican\r\ntrogon, laid upon black velvet. The only other marks are a broad\r\nneck-collar of vivid crimson, and a few delicate white touches on the\r\nouter margins of the hind wings. This species, which was then quite new\r\nand which I named after Sir James Brooke, was very rare. It was seen\r\noccasionally flying swiftly in the clearings, and now and then settling\r\nfor an instant at puddles and muddy places, so that I only succeeded in\r\ncapturing two or three specimens. In some other parts of the country I\r\nwas assured it was abundant, and a good many specimens have been sent\r\nto England; but as yet all have been males, and we are quite unable to\r\nconjecture what the female may be like, owing to the extreme isolation\r\nof the species, and its want of close affinity to any other known\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and interesting reptiles which I met with in\r\nBorneo was a large tree-frog, which was brought me by one of the Chinese\r\nworkmen. He assured me that he had seen it come down in a slanting\r\ndirection from a high tree, as if it flew. On examining it, I found the\r\ntoes very long and fully webbed to their very extremity, so that when\r\nexpanded they offered a surface much larger than the body. The\r\nforelegs were also bordered by a membrane, and the body was capable of\r\nconsiderable inflation. The back and limbs were of a very deep shining\r\ngreen colour, the undersurface and the inner toes yellow, while the\r\nwebs were black, rayed with yellow. The body was about four inches long,\r\nwhile the webs of each hind foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface\r\nof four square inches, and the webs of all the feet together about\r\ntwelve square inches. As the extremities of the toes have dilated\r\ndiscs for adhesion, showing the creature to be a true tree frog, it is\r\ndifficult to imagine that this immense membrane of the toes can be for\r\nthe purpose of swimming only, and the account of the Chinaman, that it\r\nflew down from the tree, becomes more credible. This is, I believe, the\r\nfirst instance known of a \"flying frog,\" and it is very interesting to\r\nDarwinians as showing that the variability of the toes which have been\r\nalready modified for purposes of swimming and adhesive climbing, have\r\nbeen taken advantage of to enable an allied species to pass through the\r\nair like the flying lizard. It would appear to be a new species of the\r\ngenus Rhacophorus, which consists of several frogs of a much smaller\r\nsize than this, and having the webs of the toes less developed.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Borneo I had no hunter to shoot for me regularly, and,\r\nbeing myself fully occupied with insects, I did not succeed in obtaining\r\na very good collection of the birds or Mammalia, many of which, however,\r\nare well known, being identical with species found in Malacca. Among the\r\nMammalia were five squirrels,and two tigercats--the Gymnurus Rafflesii,\r\nwhich looks like a cross between a pig and a polecat, and the Cynogale\r\nBennetti--a rare, otter-like animal, with very broad muzzle clothed with\r\nlong bristles.\r\n\r\nOne of my chief objects in coming to stay at Simunjon was to see the\r\nOrangutan (or great man-like ape of Borneo) in his native haunts, to\r\nstudy his habits, and obtain good specimens of the different varieties\r\nand species of both sexes, and of the adult and young animals. In all\r\nthese objects I succeeded beyond my expectations, and will now give some\r\naccount of my experience in hunting the Orangutan, or \"Mias,\" as it is\r\ncalled by the natives; and as this name is short, and easily pronounced,\r\nI shall generally use it in preference to Simia satyrus, or Orangutan.\r\n\r\nJust a week after my arrival at the mines, I first saw a Mias. I was out\r\ncollecting insects, not more than a quarter of a mile from the house,\r\nwhen I heard a rustling in a tree near, and, looking up, saw a large\r\nred-haired animal moving slowly along, hanging from the branches by its\r\narms. It passed on from tree to tree until it was lost in the jungle,\r\nwhich was so swampy that I could not follow it. This mode of progression\r\nwas, however, very unusual, and is more characteristic of the Hylobates\r\nthan of the Orang. I suppose there was some individual peculiarity in\r\nthis animal, or the nature of the trees just in this place rendered it\r\nthe most easy mode of progression.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight afterwards I heard that one was feeding in a tree in\r\nthe swamp just below the house, and, taking my gun, was fortunate enough\r\nto find it in the same place. As soon as I approached, it tried to\r\nconceal itself among the foliage; but, I got a shot at it, and the\r\nsecond barrel caused it to fall down almost dead, the two balls having\r\nentered the body. This was a male, about half-grown, being scarcely\r\nthree feet high. On April 26th, I was out shooting with two Dyaks, when\r\nwe found another about the same size. It fell at the first shot, but did\r\nnot seem much hurt, and immediately climbed up the nearest tree, when I\r\nfired, and it again fell, with a broken arm and a wound in the body. The\r\ntwo Dyaks now ran up to it, and each seized hold of a hand, telling me\r\nto cut a pole, and they would secure it. But although one arm was broken\r\nand it was only a half-grown animal, it was too strong for these young\r\nsavages, drawing them up towards its mouth notwithstanding all their\r\nefforts, so that they were again obliged to leave go, or they would have\r\nbeen seriously bitten. It now began climbing up the tree again; and, to\r\navoid trouble, I shot it through the heart.\r\n\r\nOn May 2nd, I again found one on a very high tree, when I had only a\r\nsmall 80-bore gun with me. However, I fired at it, and on seeing me it\r\nbegan howling in a strange voice like a cough, and seemed in a great\r\nrage, breaking off branches with its hands and throwing them down, and\r\nthen soon made off over the tree-tops. I did not care to follow it,\r\nas it was swampy, and in parts dangerous, and I might easily have lost\r\nmyself in the eagerness of pursuit.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May I found another, which behaved in a very similar\r\nmanner, howling and hooting with rage, and throwing down branches. I\r\nshot at it five times, and it remained dead on the top of the tree,\r\nsupported in a fork in such a manner that it would evidently not fall.\r\nI therefore returned home, and luckily found some Dyaks, who came back\r\nwith me, and climbed up the tree for the animal. This was the first\r\nfull-grown specimen I had obtained; but it was a female, and not nearly\r\nso large or remarkable as the full-grown males. It was, however, 3 ft.\r\n6 in. high, and its arms stretched out to a width of 6 ft. 6 in. I\r\npreserved the skin of this specimen in a cask of arrack, and prepared a\r\nperfect skeleton, which was afterwards purchased for the Derby Museum.\r\n\r\nOnly four days afterwards some Dyaks saw another Mias near the same\r\nplace, and came to tell me. We found it to be a rather large one, very\r\nhigh up on a tall tree. At the second shot it fell rolling over, but\r\nalmost immediately got up again and began to climb. At a third shot it\r\nfell dead. This was also a full-grown female, and while preparing to\r\ncarry it home, we found a young one face downwards in the bog. This\r\nlittle creature was only about a foot long, and had evidently been\r\nhanging to its mother when she first fell. Luckily it did not appear to\r\nhave been wounded, and after we had cleaned the mud out of its mouth it\r\nbegan to cry out, and seemed quite strong and active. While carrying\r\nit home it got its hands in my beard, and grasped so tightly that I had\r\ngreat difficulty in getting free, for the fingers are habitually bent\r\ninwards at the last joint so as to form complete hooks. At this time it\r\nhad not a single tooth, but a few days afterwards it cut its two lower\r\nfront teeth. Unfortunately, I had no milk to give it, as neither Malays,\r\nChinese nor Dyaks ever use the article, and I in vain inquired for\r\nany female animal that could suckle my little infant. I was therefore\r\nobliged to give it rice-water from a bottle with a quill in the cork,\r\nwhich after a few trials it learned to suck very well. This was very\r\nmeagre diet, and the little creature did not thrive well on it,\r\nalthough I added sugar and cocoa-nut milk occasionally, to make it\r\nmore nourishing. When I put my finger in its mouth it sucked with great\r\nvigour, drawing in its cheeks with all its might in the vain effort to\r\nextract some milk, and only after persevering a long time would it give\r\nup in disgust, and set up a scream very like that of a baby in similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen handled or nursed, it was very quiet and contented, but when laid\r\ndown by itself would invariably cry; and for the first few nights was\r\nvery restless and noisy. I fitted up a little box for a cradle, with a\r\nsoft mat for it to lie upon, which was changed and washed every day; and\r\nI soon found it necessary to wash the little Mias as well. After I had\r\ndone so a few times, it came to like the operation, and as soon as it\r\nwas dirty would begin crying and not leave off until I took it out and\r\ncarried it to the spout, when it immediately became quiet, although\r\nit would wince a little at the first rush of the cold water and make\r\nridiculously wry faces while the stream was running over its head. It\r\nenjoyed the wiping and rubbing dry amazingly, and when I brushed its\r\nhair seemed to be perfectly happy, lying quite still with its arms and\r\nlegs stretched out while I thoroughly brushed the long hair of its back\r\nand arms. For the first few days it clung desperately with all four\r\nhands to whatever it could lay hold of, and I had to be careful to\r\nkeep my beard out of its way, as its fingers clutched hold of hair more\r\ntenaciously than anything else, and it was impossible to free myself\r\nwithout assistance. When restless, it would struggle about with its\r\nhands up in the air trying to find something to take hold of, and, when\r\nit had got a bit of stick or rag in two or three of its hands, seemed\r\nquite happy. For want of something else, it would often seize its own\r\nfeet, and after a time it would constantly cross its arms and grasp with\r\neach hand the long hair that grew just below the opposite shoulder. The\r\ngreat tenacity of its grasp soon diminished, and I was obliged to\r\ninvent some means to give it exercise and strengthen its limbs. For this\r\npurpose I made a short ladder of three or four rounds, on which I put\r\nit to hang for a quarter of an hour at a time. At first it seemed much\r\npleased, but it could not get all four hands in a comfortable position,\r\nand, after changing about several times, would leave hold of one hand\r\nafter the other, and drop onto the floor. Sometimes when hanging only\r\nby two hands, it would loose one, and cross it to the opposite shoulder,\r\ngrasping its own hair; and, as this seemed much more agreeable than\r\nthe stick, it would then loose the other and tumble down, when it would\r\ncross both and lie on its back quite contentedly, never seeming to be\r\nhurt by its numerous tumbles. Finding it so fond of hair, I endeavoured\r\nto make an artificial mother, by wrapping up a piece of buffalo-skin\r\ninto a bundle, and suspending it about a foot from the floor. At first\r\nthis seemed to suit it admirably, as it could sprawl its legs about and\r\nalways find some hair, which it grasped with the greatest tenacity. I\r\nwas now in hopes that I had made the little orphan quite happy; and so\r\nit seemed for some time, until it began to remember its lost parent, and\r\ntry to suck. It would pull itself up close to the skin, and try about\r\neverywhere for a likely place; but, as it only succeeded in getting\r\nmouthfuls of hair and wool, it would be greatly disgusted, and scream\r\nviolently, and, after two or three attempts, let go altogether. One day\r\nit got some wool into its throat, and I thought it would have choked,\r\nbut after much gasping it recovered, and I was obliged to take the\r\nimitation mother to pieces again, and give up this last attempt to\r\nexercise the little creature.\r\n\r\nAfter the first week I found I could feed it better with a spoon, and\r\ngive it a little more varied and more solid food. Well-soaked biscuit\r\nmixed with a little egg and sugar, and sometimes sweet potatoes, were\r\nreadily eaten; and it was a never-failing amusement to observe the\r\ncurious changes of countenance by which it would express its approval\r\nor dislike of what was given to it. The poor little thing would lick its\r\nlips, draw in its cheeks, and turn up its eyes with an expression of\r\nthe most supreme satisfaction when it had a mouthful particularly to its\r\ntaste. On the other hand, when its food was not sufficiently sweet or\r\npalatable, it would turn the mouthful about with its tongue for a moment\r\nas if trying to extract what flavour there was, and then push it all\r\nout between its lips. If the same food was continued, it would set up a\r\nscream and kick about violently, exactly like a baby in a passion.\r\n\r\nAfter I had had the little Mias about three weeks, I fortunately\r\nobtained a young hare-lip monkey (Macacus cynomolgus), which, though\r\nsmall, was very active, and could feed itself. I placed it in the\r\nsame box with the Mias, and they immediately became excellent friends,\r\nneither exhibiting the least fear of the other. The little monkey would\r\nsit upon the other's stomach, or even on its face, without the least\r\nregard to its feelings. While I was feeding the Mias, the monkey would\r\nsit by, picking up all that was spilt, and occasionally putting out its\r\nhands to intercept the spoon; and as soon as I had finished would pick\r\noff what was left sticking to the Mias' lips, and then pull open its\r\nmouth and see if any still remained inside; afterwards lying down on the\r\npoor creature's stomach as on a comfortable cushion. The little helpless\r\nMias would submit to all these insults with the most exemplary patience,\r\nonly too glad to have something warm near it, which it could clasp\r\naffectionately in its arms. It sometimes, however, had its revenge; for\r\nwhen the monkey wanted to go away, the Mias would hold on as long as it\r\ncould by the loose skin of its back or head, or by its tail, and it was\r\nonly after many vigorous jumps that the monkey could make his escape.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe the different actions of these two animals,\r\nwhich could not have differed much in age. The Mias, like a very young\r\nbaby, lying on its back quite helpless, rolling lazily from side to\r\nside, stretching out all four hands into the air, wishing to grasp\r\nsomething, but hardly able to guide its fingers to any definite object;\r\nand when dissatisfied, opening wide its almost toothless mouth, and\r\nexpressing its wants by a most infantine scream. The little monkey, on\r\nthe other hand, in constant motion, running and jumping about wherever\r\nit pleased, examining everything around it, seizing hold of the smallest\r\nobject with the greatest precision, balancing itself on the edge of the\r\nbox or running up a post, and helping itself to anything eatable that\r\ncame in its way. There could hardly be a greater contrast, and the baby\r\nMias looked more baby-like by the comparison.\r\n\r\nWhen I had had it about a month, it began to exhibit some signs of\r\nlearning to run alone. When laid upon the floor it would push itself\r\nalong by its legs, or roll itself over, and thus make an unwieldy\r\nprogression. When lying in the box it would lift itself up to the edge\r\ninto almost an erect position, and once or twice succeeded in tumbling\r\nout. When left dirty, or hungry, or otherwise neglected, it would scream\r\nviolently until attended to, varied by a kind of coughing or pumping\r\nnoise very similar to that which is made by the adult animal. If no one\r\nwas in the house, or its cries were not attended to, it would be quiet\r\nafter a little while, but the moment it heard a footstep would begin\r\nagain harder than ever.\r\n\r\nAfter five weeks it cut its two upper front teeth, but in all this time\r\nit had not grown the least bit, remaining both in size and weight the\r\nsame as when I first procured it. This was no doubt owing to the want\r\nof milk or other equally nourishing food. Rice-water, rice, and biscuits\r\nwere but a poor substitute, and the expressed milk of the cocoa-nut\r\nwhich I sometimes gave it did not quite agree with its stomach. To this\r\nI imputed an attack of diarrhoea from which the poor little creature\r\nsuffered greatly, but a small dose of castor-oil operated well, and\r\ncured it. A week or two afterwards it was again taken ill, and this time\r\nmore seriously. The symptoms were exactly those of intermittent fever,\r\naccompanied by watery swellings on the feet and head. It lost all\r\nappetite for its food, and, after lingering for a week a most pitiable\r\nobject, died, after being in my possession nearly three months. I much\r\nregretted the loss of my little pet, which I had at one time looked\r\nforward to bringing up to years of maturity, and taking home to England.\r\nFor several months it had afforded me daily amusement by its curious\r\nways and the inimitably ludicrous expression of its little countenance.\r\nIts weight was three pounds nine ounces, its height fourteen inches,\r\nand the spread of its arms twenty-three inches. I preserved its skin and\r\nskeleton, and in doing so found that when it fell from the tree it must\r\nhave broken an arm and a leg, which had, however, united so rapidly that\r\nI had only noticed the hard swellings on the limbs where the irregular\r\njunction of the bones had taken place.\r\n\r\nExactly a week after I had caught this interesting little animal, I\r\nsucceeded in shooting a full-grown male Orangutan. I had just come home\r\nfrom an entomologising excursion when Charles [Charles Allen, an English\r\nlad of sixteen, accompanied me as an assistant] rushed in out of breath\r\nwith running and excitement, and exclaimed, interrupted by gasps, \"Get\r\nthe gun, sir,--be quick,--such a large Mias!\" \"Where is it?\" I asked,\r\ntaking hold of my gun as I spoke, which happened luckily to have one\r\nbarrel loaded with ball. \"Close by, sir--on the path to the mines--he\r\ncan't get away.\" Two Dyaks chanced to be in the house at the time, so I\r\ncalled them to accompany me, and started off, telling Charley to bring\r\nall the ammunition after me as soon as possible. The path from our\r\nclearing to the mines led along the side of the hill a little way up its\r\nslope, and parallel with it at the foot a wide opening had been made for\r\na road, in which several Chinamen were working, so that the animal could\r\nnot escape into the swampy forest below without descending to cross\r\nthe road or ascending to get round the clearings. We walked cautiously\r\nalong, not making the least noise, and listening attentively for any\r\nsound which might betray the presence of the Mias, stopping at intervals\r\nto gaze upwards. Charley soon joined us at the place where he had seen\r\nthe creature, and having taken the ammunition and put a bullet in\r\nthe other barrel, we dispersed a little, feeling sure that it must be\r\nsomewhere near, as it had probably descended the hill, and would not be\r\nlikely to return again.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time I heard a very slight rustling sound overhead, but on\r\ngazing up could see nothing. I moved about in every direction to get a\r\nfull view into every part of the tree under which I had been standing,\r\nwhen I again heard the same noise but louder, and saw the leaves shaking\r\nas if caused by the motion of some heavy animal which moved off to an\r\nadjoining tree. I immediately shouted for all of them to come up and try\r\nand get a view, so as to allow me to have a shot. This was not an easy\r\nmatter, as the Mias had a knack of selecting places with dense foliage\r\nbeneath. Very soon, however, one of the Dyaks called me and pointed\r\nupwards, and on looking I saw a great red hairy body and a huge black\r\nface gazing down from a great height, as if wanting to know what was\r\nmaking such a disturbance below. I instantly fired, and he made off at\r\nonce, so that I could not then tell whether I had hit him.\r\n\r\nHe now moved very rapidly and very noiselessly for so large an animal,\r\nso I told the Dyaks to follow and keep him in sight while I loaded.\r\nThe jungle was here full of large angular fragments of rock from the\r\nmountain above, and thick with hanging and twisted creepers. Running,\r\nclimbing, and creeping among these, we came up with the creature on the\r\ntop of a high tree near the road, where the Chinamen had discovered him,\r\nand were shouting their astonishment with open mouths: \"Ya Ya, Tuan;\r\nOrangutan, Tuan.\" Seeing that he could not pass here without descending,\r\nhe turned up again towards the hill, and I got two shots, and following\r\nquickly, had two more by the time he had again reached the path, but he\r\nwas always more or less concealed by foliage, and protected by the large\r\nbranch on which he was walking. Once while loading I had a splendid view\r\nof him, moving along a large limb of a tree in a semi-erect posture, and\r\nshowing it to be an animal of the largest size. At the path he got on\r\nto one of the loftiest trees in the forest, and we could see one leg\r\nhanging down useless, having been broken by a ball. He now fixed himself\r\nin a fork, where he was hidden by thick foliage, and seemed disinclined\r\nto move. I was afraid he would remain and die in this position, and as\r\nit was nearly evening. I could not have got the tree cut down that day.\r\nI therefore fired again, and he then moved off, and going up the hill\r\nwas obliged to get on to some lower trees, on the branches of one of\r\nwhich he fixed himself in such a position that he could not fall, and\r\nlay all in a heap as if dead, or dying.\r\n\r\nI now wanted the Dyaks to go up and cut off the branch he was resting\r\non, but they were afraid, saying he was not dead, and would come and\r\nattack them. We then shook the adjoining tree, pulled the hanging\r\ncreepers, and did all we could to disturb him, but without effect, so I\r\nthought it best to send for two Chinamen with axes to cut down the tree.\r\nWhile the messenger was gone, however, one of the Dyaks took courage\r\nand climbed towards him, but the Mias did not wait for him to get near,\r\nmoving off to another tree, where he got on to a dense mass of branches\r\nand creepers which almost completely hid him from our view. The tree was\r\nluckily a small one, so when the axes came we soon had it cut through;\r\nbut it was so held up by jungle ropes and climbers to adjoining trees\r\nthat it only fell into a sloping position. The Mias did not move, and\r\nI began to fear that after all we should not get him, as it was near\r\nevening, and half a dozen more trees would have to be cut down before\r\nthe one he was on would fall. As a last resource we all began pulling at\r\nthe creepers, which shook the tree very much, and, after a few minutes,\r\nwhen we had almost given up all hope, down he came with a crash and a\r\nthud like the fall of a giant. And he was a giant, his head and body\r\nbeing fully as large as a man's. He was of the kind called by the\r\nDyaks \"Mias Chappan,\" or \"Mias Pappan,\" which has the skin of the face\r\nbroadened out to a ridge or fold at each side. His outstretched arms\r\nmeasured seven feet three inches across, and his height, measuring\r\nfairly from the top of the head to the heel was four feet two inches.\r\nThe body just below the arms was three feet two inches round, and\r\nwas quite as long as a man's, the legs being exceedingly short in\r\nproportion. On examination we found he had been dreadfully wounded. Both\r\nlegs were broken, one hip-joint and the root of the spine completely\r\nshattered, and two bullets were found flattened in his neck and jaws.\r\nYet he was still alive when he fell. The two Chinamen carried him home\r\ntied to a pole, and I was occupied with Charley the whole of the next\r\nday preparing the skin and boiling the bones to make a perfect skeleton,\r\nwhich are now preserved in the Museum at Derby.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days after this, on June 4th, some Dyaks came to tell us that\r\nthe day before a Mias had nearly killed one of their companions. A few\r\nmiles down the river there is a Dyak house, and the inhabitants saw a\r\nlarge Orang feeding on the young shoots of a palm by the riverside. On\r\nbeing alarmed he retreated towards the jungle which was close by, and a\r\nnumber of the men, armed with spears and choppers, ran out to intercept\r\nhim. The man who was in front tried to run his spear through the\r\nanimal's body, but the Mias seized it in his hands, and in an instant\r\ngot hold of the man's arm, which he seized in his mouth, making his\r\nteeth meet in the flesh above the elbow, which he tore and lacerated in\r\na dreadful manner. Had not the others been close behind, the man\r\nwould have been more seriously injured, if not killed, as he was quite\r\npowerless; but they soon destroyed the creature with their spears\r\nand choppers. The man remained ill for a long time, and never fully\r\nrecovered the use of his arm.\r\n\r\nThey told me the dead Mias was still lying where it had been killed, so\r\nI offered them a reward to bring it up to our landing-place immediately,\r\nwhich they promised to do. They did not come, however, until the next\r\nday, and then decomposition had commenced, and great patches of the hair\r\ncame off, so that it was useless to skin it. This I regretted much, as\r\nit was a very fine full-grown male. I cut off the head and took it home\r\nto clean, while I got my men to make a closed fence about five feet high\r\naround the rest of the body, which would soon be devoured by maggots,\r\nsmall lizards, and ants, leaving me the skeleton. There was a great gash\r\nin his face, which had cut deep into the bone, but the skull was a very\r\nfine one, and the teeth were remarkably large and perfect.\r\n\r\nOn June 18th I had another great success, and obtained a fine adult\r\nmale. A Chinaman told me he had seen him feeding by the side of the path\r\nto the river, and I found him at the same place as the first individual\r\nI had shot. He was feeding on an oval green fruit having a fine red\r\narillus, like the mace which surrounds the nutmeg, and which alone he\r\nseemed to eat, biting off the thick outer rind and dropping it in a\r\ncontinual shower. I had found the same fruit in the stomach of some\r\nothers which I had killed. Two shots caused this animal to loose his\r\nhold, but he hung for a considerable time by one hand, and then fell\r\nflat on his face and was half buried in the swamp. For several minutes\r\nhe lay groaning and panting, while we stood close around, expecting\r\nevery breath to be his last. Suddenly, however, by a violent effort\r\nhe raised himself up, causing us all to step back a yard or two, when,\r\nstanding nearly erect, he caught hold of a small tree, and began to\r\nascend it. Another shot through the back caused him to fall down dead. A\r\nflattened bullet was found in his tongue, having entered the lower part\r\nof the abdomen and completely traversed the body, fracturing the first\r\ncervical vertebra. Yet it was after this fearful wound that he had\r\nrisen, and begun climbing with considerable facility. This also was a\r\nfull-grown male of almost exactly the same dimensions as the other two I\r\nhad measured.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st I shot another adult female, which was eating fruit in a\r\nlow tree, and was the only one which I ever killed by a single ball.\r\n\r\nOn June 24th I was called by a Chinaman to shoot a Mias, which, he said,\r\nwas on a tree close by his house, at the coal-mines. Arriving at the\r\nplace, we had some difficulty in finding the animal, as he had gone off\r\ninto the jungle, which was very rocky and difficult to traverse. At last\r\nwe found him up a very high tree, and could see that he was a male of\r\nthe largest size. As soon as I had fired, he moved higher up the tree,\r\nand while he was doing so I fired again; and we then saw that one arm\r\nwas broken. He had now reached the very highest part of an immense tree,\r\nand immediately began breaking off boughs all around, and laying them\r\nacross and across to make a nest. It was very interesting to see how\r\nwell he had chosen his place, and how rapidly he stretched out his\r\nunwounded arm in every direction, breaking off good-sized boughs with\r\nthe greatest ease, and laying them back across each other, so that in\r\na few minutes he had formed a compact mass of foliage, which entirely\r\nconcealed him from our sight. He was evidently going to pass the night\r\nhere, and would probably get away early the next morning, if not wounded\r\ntoo severely. I therefore fired again several times, in hopes of making\r\nhim leave his nest; but, though I felt sure I had hit him, as at each\r\nshot he moved a little, he would not go away. At length he raised\r\nhimself up, so that half his body was visible, and then gradually sank\r\ndown, his head alone remaining on the edge of the nest. I now felt sure\r\nhe was dead, and tried to persuade the Chinaman and his companion to cut\r\ndown the tree; but it was a very large one, and they had been at work\r\nall day, and nothing would induce them to attempt it. The next morning,\r\nat daybreak, I came to the place, and found that the Mias was evidently\r\ndead, as his head was visible in exactly the same position as before.\r\nI now offered four Chinamen a day's wages each to cut the tree down\r\nat once, as a few hours of sunshine would cause decomposition on the\r\nsurface of the skin; but, after looking at it and trying it, they\r\ndetermined that it was very big and very hard, and would not attempt\r\nit. Had I doubled my offer, they would probably have accepted it, as it\r\nwould not have been more than two or three hours' work; and had I been\r\non a short visit only, I would have done so; but as I was a resident,\r\nand intended remaining several months longer, it would not have answered\r\nto begin paying too exorbitantly, or I should have got nothing done in\r\nthe future at a lower rate.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks after, a cloud of flies could be seen all day, hovering\r\nover the body of the dead Mias; but in about a month all was quiet, and\r\nthe body was evidently drying up under the influence of a vertical sun\r\nalternating with tropical rains. Two or three months later two Malays,\r\non the offer of a dollar, climbed the tree and let down the dried\r\nremains. The skin was almost entirely enclosing the skeleton, and\r\ninside were millions of the pupa-cases of flies and other insects, with\r\nthousands of two or three species of small necrophagous beetles. The\r\nskull had been much shattered by balls, but the skeleton was perfect,\r\nexcept one small wristbone, which had probably dropped out and been\r\ncarried away by a lizard.\r\n\r\nThree days after I had shot this one and lost it, Charles found three\r\nsmall Orangs feeding together. We had a long chase after them, and had a\r\ngood opportunity of seeing how they make their way from tree to tree by\r\nalways choosing those limbs whose branches are intermingled with\r\nthose of some other tree, and then grasping several of the small twigs\r\ntogether before they venture to swing themselves across. Yet they do\r\nthis so quickly and certainly, that they make way among the trees at the\r\nrate of full five or six miles an hour, as we had continually to run to\r\nkeep up with them. One of these we shot and killed, but it remained high\r\nup in the fork of a tree; and, as young animals are of comparatively\r\nlittle interest, I did not have the tree cut down to get it.\r\n\r\nAt this time I had the misfortune to slip among some fallen trees,\r\nand hurt my ankle; and, not being careful enough at first, it became a\r\nsevere inflamed ulcer, which would not heal, and kept me a prisoner in\r\nthe house the whole of July and part of August. When I could get out\r\nagain, I determined to take a trip up a branch of the Simunjon River to\r\nSemabang, where there was said to be a large Dyak house, a mountain with\r\nabundance of fruit, and plenty of Orangs and fine birds. As the river\r\nwas very narrow, and I was obliged to go in a very small boat with\r\nlittle luggage, I only took with me a Chinese boy as a servant. I\r\ncarried a cask of medicated arrack to put Mias skins in, and stores and\r\nammunition for a fortnight. After a few miles, the stream became very\r\nnarrow and winding, and the whole country on each side was flooded. On\r\nthe banks were an abundance of monkeys--the common Macacus cynomolgus,\r\na black Semnopithecus, and the extraordinary long-nosed monkey (Nasalis\r\nlarvatus), which is as large as a three-year old child, has a very long\r\ntail, and a fleshy nose longer than that of the biggest-nosed man. The\r\nfurther we went on the narrower and more winding the stream became;\r\nfallen trees sometimes blocked up our passage, and sometimes tangled\r\nbranches and creepers met completely across it, and had to be cut away\r\nbefore we could get on. It took us two days to reach Semabang, and we\r\nhardly saw a bit of dry land all the way. In the latter part of the\r\njourney I could touch the bushes on each side for miles; and we were\r\noften delayed by the screw-pines (Pandanus), which grow abundantly in\r\nthe water, falling across the stream. In other places dense rafts of\r\nfloating grass completely filled up the channel, making our journey a\r\nconstant succession of difficulties.\r\n\r\nNear the landing-place we found a fine house, 250 feet long, raised high\r\nabove the ground on posts, with a wide verandah and still wider platform\r\nof bamboo in front of it. Almost all the people, however, were away on\r\nsome excursion after edible birds'-nests or bees'-wax, and there only\r\nremained in the house two or three old men and women with a lot of\r\nchildren. The mountain or hill was close by, covered with a complete\r\nforest of fruit-trees, among which the Durian and Mangosteen were very\r\nabundant; but the fruit was not yet quite ripe, except a little here\r\nand there. I spent a week at this place, going out everyday in various\r\ndirections about the mountain, accompanied by a Malay, who had stayed\r\nwith me while the other boatmen returned. For three days we found no\r\nOrangs, but shot a deer and several monkeys. On the fourth day, however,\r\nwe found a Mias feeding on a very lofty Durian tree, and succeeded in\r\nkilling it, after eight shots. Unfortunately it remained in the tree,\r\nhanging by its hands, and we were obliged to leave it and return home,\r\nas it was several miles off. As I felt pretty sure it would fall during\r\nthe night, I returned to the place early the next morning, and found\r\nit on the ground beneath the tree. To my astonishment and pleasure, it\r\nappeared to be a different kind from any I had yet seen; for although a\r\nfull-grown male, by its fully developed teeth and very large canines,\r\nit had no sign of the lateral protuberance on the face, and was about\r\none-tenth smaller in all its dimensions than the other adult males.\r\nThe upper incisors, however, appeared to be broader than in the larger\r\nspecies, a character distinguishing the Simia morio of Professor Owen,\r\nwhich he had described from the cranium of a female specimen. As it was\r\ntoo far to carry the animal home, I set to work and skinned the body on\r\nthe spot, leaving the head, hands, and feet attached, to be finished at\r\nhome. This specimen is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week, finding no more Orangs, I returned home; and,\r\ntaking in a few fresh stores, and this time accompanied by Charles, went\r\nup another branch of the river, very similar in character, to a place\r\ncalled Menyille, where there were several small Dyak houses and one\r\nlarge one. Here the landing place was a bridge of rickety poles, over a\r\nconsiderable distance of water; and I thought it safer to leave my cask\r\nof arrack securely placed in the fork of a tree. To prevent the natives\r\nfrom drinking it, I let several of them see me put in a number of snakes\r\nand lizards; but I rather think this did not prevent them from tasting\r\nit. We were accommodated here in the verandah of the large house, in\r\nwhich were several great baskets of dried human heads, the trophies of\r\npast generations of head-hunters. Here also there was a little mountain\r\ncovered with fruit-trees, and there were some magnificent Durian trees\r\nclose by the house, the fruit of which was ripe; and as the Dyaks looked\r\nupon me as a benefactor in killing the Mias, which destroys a great deal\r\nof their fruit, they let us eat as much as we liked; we revelled in this\r\nemperor of fruits in its greatest perfection.\r\n\r\nThe very day after my arrival in this place, I was so fortunate as to\r\nshoot another adult male of the small Orang, the Mias-kassir of the\r\nDyaks. It fell when dead, but caught in a fork of the tree and remained\r\nfixed. As I was very anxious to get it, I tried to persuade two young\r\nDyaks who were with me to cut down the tree, which was tall, perfectly\r\nstraight and smooth-barked, and without a branch for fifty or sixty\r\nfeet. To my surprise, they said they would prefer climbing up it, but it\r\nwould be a good deal of trouble, and, after a little talking together,\r\nthey said they would try. They first went to a clump of bamboo that\r\nstood near, and cut down one of the largest stems. From this they\r\nchopped off a short piece, and splitting it, made a couple of stout\r\npegs, about a foot long and sharp at one end. Then cutting a thick piece\r\nof wood for a mallet, they drove one of the pegs into the tree and hung\r\ntheir weight upon it. It held, and this seemed to satisfy them, for they\r\nimmediately began making a quantity of pegs of the same kind, while I\r\nlooked on with great interest, wondering how they could possibly ascend\r\nsuch a lofty tree by merely driving pegs in it, the failure of any one\r\nof which at a good height would certainly cause their death. When about\r\ntwo dozen pegs were made, one of them began cutting some very long and\r\nslender bamboo from another clump, and also prepared some cord from the\r\nbark of a small tree. They now drove in a peg very firmly at about three\r\nfeet from the ground, and bringing one of the long bamboos, stood it\r\nupright close to the tree, and bound it firmly to the two first pegs, by\r\nmeans of the bark cord and small notches near the head of each peg.\r\nOne of the Dyaks now stood on the first peg and drove in a third, about\r\nlevel with his face, to which he tied the bamboo in the same way, and\r\nthen mounted another step, standing on one foot, and holding by the\r\nbamboo at the peg immediately above him, while he drove in the next one.\r\nIn this manner he ascended about twenty feet; when the upright bamboo\r\nwas becoming thin, another was handed up by his companion, and this was\r\njoined by tying both bamboos to three or four of the pegs. When this\r\nwas also nearly ended, a third was added, and shortly after, the lowest\r\nbranches of the tree were reached, along which the young Dyak scrambled,\r\nand soon sent the Mias tumbling down headlong. I was exceedingly struck\r\nby the ingenuity of this mode of climbing, and the admirable manner in\r\nwhich the peculiar properties of the bamboo were made available. The\r\nladder itself was perfectly safe, since if any one peg were loose or\r\nfaulty, and gave way, the strain would be thrown on several others\r\nabove and below it. I now understood the use of the line of bamboo pegs\r\nsticking in trees, which I had often seen, and wondered for what purpose\r\nthey could have been put there. This animal was almost identical in size\r\nand appearance with the one I had obtained at Semabang, and was the only\r\nother male specimen of the Simia morio which I obtained. It is now in\r\nthe Derby Museum.\r\n\r\nI afterwards shot two adult females and two young ones of different\r\nages, all of which I preserved. One of the females, with several young\r\nones, was feeding on a Durian tree with unripe fruit; and as soon as she\r\nsaw us she began breaking off branches and the great spiny fruits\r\nwith every appearance of rage, causing such a shower of missiles as\r\neffectually kept us from approaching too near the tree. This habit of\r\nthrowing down branches when irritated has been doubted, but I have, as\r\nhere narrated, observed it myself on at least three separate occasions.\r\nIt was however always the female Mias who behaved in this way, and\r\nit may be that the male, trusting more to his great strength and his\r\npowerful canine teeth, is not afraid of any other animal, and does not\r\nwant to drive them away, while the parental instinct of the female leads\r\nher to adopt this mode of defending herself and her young ones.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the skins and skeletons of these animals, I was much\r\ntroubled by the Dyak dogs, which, being always kept in a state of\r\nsemi-starvation, are ravenous for animal food. I had a great iron pan,\r\nin which I boiled the bones to make skeletons, and at night I covered\r\nthis over with boards, and put heavy stones upon it; but the dogs\r\nmanaged to remove these and carried away the greater part of one of my\r\nspecimens. On another occasion they gnawed away a good deal of the upper\r\nleather of my strong boots, and even ate a piece of my mosquito-curtain,\r\nwhere some lamp-oil had been spilt over it some weeks before.\r\n\r\nOn our return down the stream, we had the fortune to fall in with a\r\nvery old male Mias, feeding on some low trees growing in the water. The\r\ncountry was flooded for a long distance, but so full of trees and stumps\r\nthat the laden boat could not be got in among them, and if it could have\r\nbeen we should only have frightened the Mias away. I therefore got into\r\nthe water, which was nearly up to my waist, and waded on until I was\r\nnear enough for a shot. The difficulty then was to load my gun again,\r\nfor I was so deep in the water that I could not hold the gun sloping\r\nenough to pour the powder in. I therefore had to search for a shallow\r\nplace, and after several shots under these trying circumstances, I was\r\ndelighted to see the monstrous animal roll over into the water. I now\r\ntowed him after me to the stream, but the Malays objected to having the\r\nanimal put into the boat, and he was so heavy that I could not do it\r\nwithout their help. I looked about for a place to skin him, but not a\r\nbit of dry ground was to be seen, until at last I found a clump of two\r\nor three old trees and stumps, between which a few feet of soil had\r\ncollected just above the water, which was just large enough for us to\r\ndrag the animal upon it. I first measured him, and found him to be by\r\nfar the largest I had yet seen, for, though the standing height was the\r\nsame as the others (4 feet 2 inches), the outstretched arms were 7\r\nfeet 9 inches, which was six inches more than the previous one, and\r\nthe immense broad face was 13 1/2 inches wide, whereas the widest I had\r\nhitherto seen was only 11 1/2 inches. The girth of the body was 3 feet\r\n7 1/2 inches. I am inclined to believe, therefore, that the length and\r\nstrength of the arms, and the width of the face continues increasing to\r\na very great age, while the standing height, from the sole of the foot\r\nto the crown of the head, rarely if ever exceeds 4 feet 2 inches.\r\n\r\nAs this was the last Mias I shot, and the last time I saw an adult\r\nliving animal, I will give a sketch of its general habits, and any other\r\nfacts connected with it. The Orangutan is known to inhabit Sumatra and\r\nBorneo, and there is every reason to believe that it is confined to\r\nthese two great islands, in the former of which, however, it seems to be\r\nmuch more rare. In Borneo it has a wide range, inhabiting many districts\r\non the southwest, southeast, northeast, and northwest coasts, but\r\nappears to be chiefly confined to the low and swampy forests. It seems,\r\nat first sight, very inexplicable that the Mias should be quite unknown\r\nin the Sarawak valley, while it is abundant in Sambas, on the west, and\r\nSadong, on the east. But when we know the habits and mode of life of\r\nthe animal, we see a sufficient reason for this apparent anomaly in\r\nthe physical features of the Sarawak district. In the Sadong, where I\r\nobserved it, the Mias is only found when the country is low level and\r\nswampy, and at the same time covered with a lofty virgin forest. From\r\nthese swamps rise many isolated mountains, on some of which the Dyaks\r\nhave settled and covered with plantations of fruit trees. These are a\r\ngreat attraction to the Mias, which comes to feed on the unripe fruits,\r\nbut always retires to the swamp at night. Where the country becomes\r\nslightly elevated, and the soil dry, the Mias is no longer to be found.\r\nFor example, in all the lower part of the Sadong valley it abounds, but\r\nas soon as we ascend above the limits of the tides, where the country,\r\nthough still flat, is high enough to be dry, it disappears. Now the\r\nSarawak valley has this peculiarity--the lower portion though swampy, is\r\nnot covered with a continuous lofty forest, but is principally occupied\r\nby the Nipa palm; and near the town of Sarawak where the country becomes\r\ndry, it is greatly undulated in many parts, and covered with small\r\npatches of virgin forest, and much second-growth jungle on the ground,\r\nwhich has once been cultivated by the Malays or Dyaks.\r\n\r\nNow it seems probable to me that a wide extent of unbroken and equally\r\nlofty virgin forest is necessary to the comfortable existence of these\r\nanimals. Such forests form their open country, where they can roam in\r\nevery direction with as much facility as the Indian on the prairie, or\r\nthe Arab on the desert, passing from tree-top to tree-top without ever\r\nbeing obliged to descend upon the earth. The elevated and the drier\r\ndistricts are more frequented by man, more cut up by clearings and low\r\nsecond-growth jungle--not adapted to its peculiar mode of progression,\r\nand where it would therefore be more exposed to danger, and more\r\nfrequently obliged to descend upon the earth. There is probably also a\r\ngreater variety of fruit in the Mias district, the small mountains which\r\nrise like islands out of it serving as gardens or plantations of a sort,\r\nwhere the trees of the uplands are to be found in the very midst of the\r\nswampy plains.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular and very interesting sight to watch a Mias making his\r\nway leisurely through the forest. He walks deliberately along some of\r\nthe larger branches in the semi-erect attitude which the great length\r\nof his arms and the shortness of his legs cause him naturally to assume;\r\nand the disproportion between these limbs is increased by his walking\r\non his knuckles, not on the palm of the hand, as we should do. He seems\r\nalways to choose those branches which intermingle with an adjoining\r\ntree, on approaching which he stretches out his long arms, and seizing\r\nthe opposing boughs, grasps them together with both hands, seems to try\r\ntheir strength, and then deliberately swings himself across to the next\r\nbranch, on which he walks along as before. He never jumps or springs,\r\nor even appears to hurry himself, and yet manages to get along almost\r\nas quickly as a person can run through the forest beneath. The long\r\nand powerful arms are of the greatest use to the animal, enabling it\r\nto climb easily up the loftiest trees, to seize fruits and young leaves\r\nfrom slender boughs which will not bear its weight, and to gather leaves\r\nand branches with which to form its nest. I have already described how\r\nit forms a nest when wounded, but it uses a similar one to sleep on\r\nalmost every night. This is placed low down, however, on a small tree\r\nnot more than from twenty to fifty feet from the ground, probably\r\nbecause it is warmer and less exposed to wind than higher up. Each Mias\r\nis said to make a fresh one for himself every night; but I should think\r\nthat is hardly probable, or their remains would be much more abundant;\r\nfor though I saw several about the coal-mines, there must have been many\r\nOrangs about every day, and in a year their deserted nests would become\r\nvery numerous. The Dyaks say that, when it is very wet, the Mias covers\r\nhimself over with leaves of pandanus, or large ferns, which has perhaps\r\nled to the story of his making a hut in the trees.\r\n\r\nThe Orang does not leave his bed until the sun has well risen and has\r\ndried up the dew upon the leaves. He feeds all through the middle of the\r\nday, but seldom returns to the same tree two days running. They do not\r\nseem much alarmed at man, as they often stared down upon me for several\r\nminutes, and then only moved away slowly to an adjacent tree. After\r\nseeing one, I have often had to go half a mile or more to fetch my gun,\r\nand in nearly every case have found it on the same tree, or within\r\na hundred yards, when I returned. I never saw two full-grown animals\r\ntogether, but both males and females are sometimes accompanied by\r\nhalf-grown young ones, while, at other times, three or four young ones\r\nwere seen in company. Their food consists almost exclusively of fruit,\r\nwith occasionally leaves, buds, and young shoots. They seem to prefer\r\nunripe fruits, some of which were very sour, others intensely bitter,\r\nparticularly the large red, fleshy arillus of one which seemed an\r\nespecial favourite. In other cases they eat only the small seed of a\r\nlarge fruit, and they almost always waste and destroy more than they\r\neat, so that there is a continual rain of rejected portions below the\r\ntree they are feeding on. The Durian is an especial favourite, and\r\nquantities of this delicious fruit are destroyed wherever it grows\r\nsurrounded by forest, but they will not cross clearings to get at them.\r\nIt seems wonderful how the animal can tear open this fruit, the outer\r\ncovering of which is so thick and tough, and closely covered with strong\r\nconical spines. It probably bites off a few of these first, and then,\r\nmaking a small hole, tears open the fruit with its powerful fingers.\r\n\r\nThe Mias rarely descends to the ground, except when pressed by hunger,\r\nit seeks succulent shoots by the riverside; or, in very dry weather,\r\nhas to search after water, of which it generally finds sufficient in the\r\nhollows of leaves. Only once I saw two half-grown Orangs on the ground\r\nin a dry hollow at the foot of the Simunjon hill. They were playing\r\ntogether, standing erect, and grasping each other by the arms. It may\r\nbe safely stated, however, that the Orang never walks erect, unless when\r\nusing its hands to support itself by branches overhead or when attacked.\r\nRepresentations of its walking with a stick are entirely imaginary.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks all declare that the Mias is never attacked by any animal in\r\nthe forest, with two rare exceptions; and the accounts I received\r\nof these are so curious that I give them nearly in the words of my\r\ninformants, old Dyak chiefs, who had lived all their lives in the places\r\nwhere the animal is most abundant. The first of whom I inquired said:\r\n\"No animal is strong enough to hurt the Mias, and the only creature he\r\never fights with is the crocodile. When there is no fruit in the jungle,\r\nhe goes to seek food on the banks of the river where there are plenty\r\nof young shoots that he likes, and fruits that grow close to the water.\r\nThen the crocodile sometimes tries to seize him, but the Mias gets upon\r\nhim, and beats him with his hands and feet, and tears him and kills\r\nhim.\" He added that he had once seen such a fight, and that he believes\r\nthat the Mias is always the victor.\r\n\r\nMy next informant was the Orang Kaya, or chief of the Balow Dyaks, on\r\nthe Simunjon River. He said: \"The Mias has no enemies; no animals\r\ndare attack it but the crocodile and the python. He always kills the\r\ncrocodile by main strength, standing upon it, pulling open its jaws, and\r\nripping up its throat. If a python attacks a Mias, he seizes it with his\r\nhands, and then bites it, and soon kills it. The Mias is very strong;\r\nthere is no animal in the jungle so strong as he.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that an animal so large, so peculiar, and of such\r\na high type of form as the Orangutan, should be confined to so limited\r\na district--to two islands, and those almost the last inhabited by\r\nthe higher Mammalia; for, east of Borneo and Java, the Quadrumania,\r\nRuminants, Carnivora, and many other groups of Mammalia diminish\r\nrapidly, and soon entirely disappear. When we consider, further, that\r\nalmost all other animals have in earlier ages been represented by allied\r\nyet distinct forms--that, in the latter part of the tertiary period,\r\nEurope was inhabited by bears, deer, wolves, and cats; Australia by\r\nkangaroos and other marsupials; South America by gigantic sloths and\r\nant-eaters; all different from any now existing, though intimately\r\nallied to them--we have every reason to believe that the Orangutan, the\r\nChimpanzee, and the Gorilla have also had their forerunners. With what\r\ninterest must every naturalist look forward to the time when the caves\r\nand tertiary deposits of the tropics may be thoroughly examined, and the\r\npast history and earliest appearance of the great man-like apes be made\r\nknown at length.\r\n\r\nI will now say a few words as to the supposed existence of a Bornean\r\nOrang as large as the Gorilla. I have myself examined the bodies of\r\nseventeen freshly-killed Orangs, all of which were carefully measured;\r\nand of seven of them, I preserved the skeleton. I also obtained two\r\nskeletons killed by other persons. Of this extensive series, sixteen\r\nwere fully adult, nine being males, and seven females. The adult males\r\nof the large Orangs only varied from 4 feet 1 inch to 4 feet 2 inches\r\nin height, measured fairly to the heel, so as to give the height of the\r\nanimal if it stood perfectly erect; the extent of the outstretched arms,\r\nfrom 7 feet 2 inches to 7 feet 8 inches; and the width of the face, from\r\n10 inches to 13 1/2 inches. The dimensions given by other naturalists\r\nclosely agree with mine. The largest Orang measured by Temminck was 4\r\nfeet high. Of twenty-five specimens collected by Schlegel and Muller,\r\nthe largest old male was 4 feet 1 inch; and the largest skeleton in\r\nthe Calcutta Museum was, according to Mr. Blyth, 4 feet 1 1/2 inch.\r\nMy specimens were all from the northwest coast of Borneo; those of the\r\nDutch from the west and south coasts; and no specimen has yet reached\r\nEurope exceeding these dimensions, although the total number of skins\r\nand skeletons must amount to over a hundred.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, however, several persons declare that they have measured\r\nOrangs of a much larger size. Temminck, in his Monograph of the Orang,\r\nsays that he has just received news of the capture of a specimen 5 feet\r\n3 inches high. Unfortunately, it never seems to have a reached Holland,\r\nfor nothing has since been heard of any such animal. Mr. St. John, in\r\nhis \"Life in the Forests of the Far East,\" vol. ii. p. 237, tells us\r\nof an Orang shot by a friend of his, which was 5 feet 2 inches from the\r\nheel to the top of the head, the arm 17 inches in girth, and the wrist\r\n12 inches! The head alone was brought to Sarawak, and Mr. St. John tells\r\nus that he assisted to measure this, and that it was 15 inches broad\r\nby 14 long. Unfortunately, even this skull appears not to have been\r\npreserved, for no specimen corresponding to these dimensions has yet\r\nreached England.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Sir James Brooke, dated October 1857 in which he\r\nacknowledges the receipt of my Papers on the Orang, published in the\r\n\"Annals and Magazine of Natural History,\" he sends me the measurements\r\nof a specimen killed by his nephew, which I will give exactly as I\r\nreceived it: \"September 3rd, 1867, killed female Orangutan. Height, from\r\nhead to heel, 4 feet 6 inches. Stretch from fingers to fingers across\r\nbody, 6 feet 1 inch. Breadth of face, including callosities, 11 inches.\"\r\nNow, in these dimensions, there is palpably one error; for in every\r\nOrang yet measured by any naturalist, an expanse of arms of 6 feet 1\r\ninch corresponds to a height of about 3 feet 6 inches, while the largest\r\nspecimens of 4 feet to 4 feet 2 inches high, always have the extended\r\narms as much as 7 feet 3 inches to 7 feet 8 inches. It is, in fact, one\r\nof the characters of the genus to have the arms so long that an animal\r\nstanding nearly erect can rest its fingers on the ground. A height of\r\n4 feet 6 inches would therefore require a stretch of arms of at least 8\r\nfeet! If it were only 6 feet to that height, as given in the dimensions\r\nquoted, the animal would not be an Orang at all, but a new genus of\r\napes, differing materially in habits and mode of progression. But Mr.\r\nJohnson, who shot this animal, and who knows Orangs well, evidently\r\nconsidered it to be one; and we have therefore to judge whether it is\r\nmore probable that he made a mistake of two feet in the stretch of the\r\narms, or of one foot in the height. The latter error is certainly the\r\neasiest to make, and it will bring his animal into agreement, as to\r\nproportions and size, with all those which exist in Europe. How easy it\r\nis to be deceived as to the height of these animals is well shown in\r\nthe case of the Sumatran Orang, the skin of which was described by Dr.\r\nClarke Abel. The captain and crew who killed this animal declared that\r\nwhen alive he exceeded the tallest man, and looked so gigantic that they\r\nthought he was 7 feet high; but that, when he was killed and lay upon\r\nthe ground, they found he was only about 6 feet. Now it will hardly be\r\ncredited that the skin of this identical animal exists in the Calcutta\r\nMuseum, and Mr. Blyth, the late curator, states \"that it is by no means\r\none of the largest size\"; which means that it is about 4 feet high!\r\n\r\nHaving these undoubted examples of error in the dimensions of Orangs,\r\nit is not too much to conclude that Mr. St. John's friend made a similar\r\nerror of measurement, or rather, perhaps, of memory; for we are not told\r\nthat the dimensions were noted down at the time they were made. The only\r\nfigures given by Mr. St. John on his own authority are that \"the head\r\nwas 15 inches broad by 14 inches long.\" As my largest male was 13 1/2\r\nbroad across the face, measured as soon as the animal was killed, I\r\ncan quite understand that when the head arrived at Sarawak from the\r\nBatang-Lupar, after two or three days' voyage, it was so swollen by\r\ndecomposition as to measure an inch more than when it was fresh. On the\r\nwhole, therefore, I think it will be allowed, that up to this time\r\nwe have not the least reliable evidence of the existence of Orangs in\r\nBorneo more than 4 feet 2 inches high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. BORNEO--JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n (NOVEMBER 1855 TO JANUARY 1856.)\r\n\r\nAs the wet season was approaching, I determined to return to Sarawak,\r\nsending all my collections with Charles Allen around by sea, while I\r\nmyself proposed to go up to the sources of the Sadong River and descend\r\nby the Sarawak valley. As the route was somewhat difficult, I took the\r\nsmallest quantity of baggage, and only one servant, a Malay lad named\r\nBujon, who knew the language of the Sadong Dyaks, with whom he had\r\ntraded. We left the mines on the 27th of November, and the next day\r\nreached the Malay village of Gúdong, where I stayed a short time to buy\r\nfruit and eggs, and called upon the Datu Bandar, or Malay governor of\r\nthe place. He lived in a large, and well-built house, very dirty outside\r\nand in, and was very inquisitive about my business, and particularly\r\nabout the coal-mines. These puzzle the natives exceedingly, as they\r\ncannot understand the extensive and costly preparations for working\r\ncoal, and cannot believe it is to be used only as fuel when wood is so\r\nabundant and so easily obtained. It was evident that Europeans seldom\r\ncame here, for numbers of women skeltered away as I walked through the\r\nvillage and one girl about ten or twelve years old, who had just brought\r\na bamboo full of water from the river, threw it down with a cry of\r\nhorror and alarm the moment she caught sight of me, turned around and\r\njumped into the stream. She swam beautifully, and kept looking back as\r\nif expecting I would follow her, screaming violently all the time; while\r\na number of men and boys were laughing at her ignorant terror.\r\n\r\nAt Jahi, the next village, the stream became so swift in consequence of\r\na flood, that my heavy boat could make no way, and I was obliged to send\r\nit back and go on in a very small open one. So far the river had been\r\nvery monotonous, the banks being cultivated as rice-fields, and little\r\nthatched huts alone breaking the unpicturesque line of muddy bank\r\ncrowned with tall grasses, and backed by the top of the forest behind\r\nthe cultivated ground. A few hours beyond Jahi we passed the limits\r\nof cultivation, and had the beautiful virgin forest coming down to the\r\nwater's edge, with its palms and creepers, its noble trees, its ferns,\r\nand epiphytes. The banks of the river were, however, still generally\r\nflooded, and we had some difficulty in finding a dry spot to sleep\r\non. Early in the morning we reached Empugnan, a small Malay village,\r\nsituated at the foot of an isolated mountain which had been visible from\r\nthe mouth of the Simunjon River. Beyond here the tides are not felt,\r\nand we now entered upon a district of elevated forest, with a finer\r\nvegetation. Large trees stretch out their arms across the stream,\r\nand the steep, earthy banks are clothed with ferns and zingiberaceous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon we arrived at Tabókan, the first village of the\r\nHill Dyaks. On an open space near the river, about twenty boys were\r\nplaying at a game something like what we call \"prisoner's base;\" their\r\nornaments of beads and brass wire and their gay-coloured kerchiefs and\r\nwaist-cloths showing to much advantage, and forming a very pleasing\r\nsight. On being called by Bujon, they immediately left their game to\r\ncarry my things up to the \"headhouse,\"--a circular building attached to\r\nmost Dyak villages, and serving as a lodging for strangers, the place\r\nfor trade, the sleeping-room of the unmarried youths, and the general\r\ncouncil-chamber. It is elevated on lofty posts, has a large fireplace in\r\nthe middle and windows in the roof all round, and forms a very pleasant\r\nand comfortable abode. In the evening it was crowded with young men and\r\nboys, who came to look at me. They were mostly fine young fellows, and\r\nI could not help admiring the simplicity and elegance of their costume.\r\nTheir only dress is the long \"chawat,\" or waist-cloth, which hangs down\r\nbefore and behind. It is generally of blue cotton, ending in three\r\nbroad bands of red, blue, and white. Those who can afford it wear a\r\nhandkerchief on the head, which is either red, with a narrow border\r\nof gold lace, or of three colours, like the \"chawat.\" The large flat\r\nmoon-shaped brass earrings, the heavy necklace of white or black beads,\r\nrows of brass rings on the arms and legs, and armlets of white shell,\r\nall serve to relieve and set off the pure reddish brown skin and\r\njet-black hair. Add to this the little pouch containing materials for\r\nbetel-chewing, and a long slender knife, both invariably worn at the\r\nside, and you have the everyday dress of the young Dyak gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe \"Orang Kaya,\" or rich man, as the chief of the tribe is called,\r\nnow came in with several of the older men; and the \"bitchara\" or talk\r\ncommenced, about getting a boat and men to take me on the next morning.\r\nAs I could not understand a word of their language, which is very\r\ndifferent from Malay, I took no part in the proceedings, but was\r\nrepresented by my boy Bujon, who translated to me most of what was said.\r\nA Chinese trader was in the house, and he, too, wanted men the next day;\r\nbut on his hinting this to the Orang Kaya, he was sternly told that a\r\nwhite man's business was now being discussed, and he must wait another\r\nday before his could be thought about.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"bitchara\" was over and the old chiefs gone, I asked the young\r\nmen to play or dance, or amuse themselves in their accustomed way; and\r\nafter some little hesitation they agreed to do so. They first had a\r\ntrial of strength, two boys sitting opposite each other, foot being\r\nplaced against foot, and a stout stick grasped by both their hands. Each\r\nthen tried to throw himself back, so as to raise his adversary up from\r\nthe ground, either by main strength or by a sudden effort. Then one of\r\nthe men would try his strength against two or three of the boys; and\r\nafterwards they each grasped their own ankle with a hand, and while one\r\nstood as firm as he could, the other swung himself around on one leg, so\r\nas to strike the other's free leg, and try to overthrow him. When these\r\ngames had been played all around with varying success, we had a novel\r\nkind of concert. Some placed a leg across the knee, and struck the\r\nfingers sharply on the ankle, others beat their arms against their sides\r\nlike a cock when he is going to crow, this making a great variety of\r\nclapping sounds, while another with his hand under his armpit produced a\r\ndeep trumpet note; and, as they all kept time very well, the effect was\r\nby no means unpleasing. This seemed quite a favourite amusement with\r\nthem, and they kept it up with much spirit.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we started in a boat about thirty feet long, and\r\nonly twenty-eight inches wide. The stream here suddenly changes its\r\ncharacter. Hitherto, though swift, it had been deep and smooth, and\r\nconfined by steep banks. Now it rushed and rippled over a pebbly, sandy,\r\nor rocky bed, occasionally forming miniature cascades and rapids, and\r\nthrowing up on one side or the other broad banks of finely coloured\r\npebbles. No paddling could make way here, but the Dyaks with bamboo\r\npoles propelled us along with great dexterity and swiftness, never\r\nlosing their balance in such a narrow and unsteady vessel, though\r\nstanding up and exerting all their force. It was a brilliant day, and\r\nthe cheerful exertions of the men, the rushing of the sparkling waters,\r\nwith the bright and varied foliage, which from either bank stretched\r\nover our heads, produced an exhilarating sensation which recalled my\r\ncanoe voyages on the grander waters of South America.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon we reached the village of Borotói, and, though it\r\nwould have been easy to reach the next one before night, I was obliged\r\nto stay, as my men wanted to return and others could not possibly go on\r\nwith me without the preliminary talking. Besides, a white man was too\r\ngreat a rarity to be allowed to escape them, and their wives would never\r\nhave forgiven them if, when they returned from the fields, they found\r\nthat such a curiosity had not been kept for them to see. On entering the\r\nhouse to which I was invited, a crowd of sixty or seventy men, women,\r\nand children gathered around me, and I sat for half an hour like some\r\nstrange animal submitted for the first time to the gaze of an inquiring\r\npublic. Brass rings were here in the greatest profusion, many of the\r\nwomen having their arms completely covered with them, as well as their\r\nlegs from the ankle to the knee. Round the waist they wear a dozen\r\nor more coils of fine rattan stained red, to which the petticoat is\r\nattached. Below this are generally a number of coils of brass wire, a\r\ngirdle of small silver coins, and sometimes a broad belt of brass ring\r\narmour. On their heads they wear a conical hat without a crown, formed\r\nof variously coloured beads, kept in shape by rings of rattan, and\r\nforming a fantastic but not unpicturesque headdress.\r\n\r\nWalking out to a small hill near the village, cultivated as a\r\nrice-field, I had a fine view of the country, which was becoming quite\r\nhilly, and towards the south, mountainous. I took bearings and sketches\r\nof all that was visible, an operation which caused much astonishment\r\nto the Dyaks who accompanied me, and produced a request to exhibit the\r\ncompass when I returned. I was then surrounded by a larger crowd than\r\nbefore, and when I took my evening meal in the midst of a circle of\r\nabout a hundred spectators anxiously observing every movement and\r\ncriticising every mouthful, my thoughts involuntarily recurred to the\r\nlion at feeding time. Like those noble animals, I too was used to it,\r\nand it did not affect my appetite. The children here were more shy than\r\nat Tabókan, and I could not persuade them to play. I therefore turned\r\nshowman myself, and exhibited the shadow of a dog's head eating, which\r\npleased them so much that all the village in succession came out to\r\nsee it. The \"rabbit on the wall\" does not do in Borneo, as there is\r\nno animal it resembles. The boys had tops shaped something like\r\nwhipping-tops, but spun with a string.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we proceeded as before, but the river had become so\r\nrapid and shallow and the boats were all so small, that though I had\r\nnothing with me but a change of clothes, a gun, and a few cooking\r\nutensils, two were required to take me on. The rock which appeared\r\nhere and there on the riverbank was an indurated clay-slate, sometimes\r\ncrystalline, and thrown up almost vertically. Right and left of us rose\r\nisolated limestone mountains, their white precipices glistening in\r\nthe sun and contrasting beautifully with the luxuriant vegetation that\r\nelsewhere clothed them. The river bed was a mass of pebbles, mostly\r\npure white quartz, but with abundance of jasper and agate, presenting a\r\nbeautifully variegated appearance. It was only ten in the morning when\r\nwe arrived at Budw, and, though there were plenty of people about, I\r\ncould not induce them to allow me to go on to the next village. The\r\nOrang Kaya said that if I insisted on having men, of course he would get\r\nthem, but when I took him at his word and said I must have them, there\r\ncame a fresh remonstrance; and the idea of my going on that day seemed\r\nso painful that I was obliged to submit. I therefore walked out over\r\nthe rice-fields, which are here very extensive, covering a number of the\r\nlittle hills and valleys into which the whole country seems broken up,\r\nand obtained a fine view of hills and mountains in every direction.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Orang Kaya came in full dress (a spangled velvet\r\njacket, but no trousers), and invited me over to his house, where he\r\ngave me a seat of honour under a canopy of white calico and coloured\r\nhandkerchiefs. The great verandah was crowded with people, and large\r\nplates of rice with cooked and fresh eggs were placed on the ground as\r\npresents for me. A very old man then dressed himself in bright-coloured\r\ncloths and many ornaments, and sitting at the door, murmured a long\r\nprayer or invocation, sprinkling rice from a basin he held in his hand,\r\nwhile several large gongs were loudly beaten and a salute of muskets\r\nfired off. A large jar of rice wine, very sour but with an agreeable\r\nflavour, was then handed around, and I asked to see some of their\r\ndances. These were, like most savage performances, very dull and\r\nungraceful affairs; the men dressing themselves absurdly like women, and\r\nthe girls making themselves as stiff and ridiculous as possible. All the\r\ntime six or eight large Chinese gongs were being beaten by the vigorous\r\narms of as many young men, producing such a deafening discord that I was\r\nglad to escape to the round house, where I slept very comfortably with\r\nhalf a dozen smoke-dried human skulls suspended over my head.\r\n\r\nThe river was now so shallow that boats could hardly get along. I\r\ntherefore preferred walking to the next village, expecting to see\r\nsomething of the country, but was much disappointed, as the path lay\r\nalmost entirely through dense bamboo thickets. The Dyaks get two crops\r\noff the ground in succession; one of rice, and the other of sugar-cane,\r\nmaize, and vegetables. The ground then lies fallow eight or ten years,\r\nand becomes covered with bamboos and shrubs, which often completely\r\narch over the path and shut out everything from the view. Three hours'\r\nwalking brought us to the village of Senankan, where I was again obliged\r\nto remain the whole day, which I agreed to do on the promise of the\r\nOrang Kaya that his men should next day take me through two other\r\nvillages across to Senna, at the head of the Sarawak River. I amused\r\nmyself as I best could till evening, by walking about the high ground\r\nnear, to get views of the country and bearings of the chief mountains.\r\nThere was then another public audience, with gifts of rice and eggs, and\r\ndrinking of rice wine. These Dyaks cultivate a great extent of ground,\r\nand supply a good deal of rice to Sarawak. They are rich in gongs, brass\r\ntrays, wire, silver coins, and other articles in which a Dyak's wealth\r\nconsists; and their women and children are all highly ornamented with\r\nbead necklaces, shells, and brass wire.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I waited some time, but the men that were to accompany me\r\ndid not make their appearance. On sending to the Orang Kaya I found that\r\nboth he and another head-man had gone out for the day, and on inquiring\r\nthe reason was told that they could not persuade any of their men to\r\ngo with me because the journey was a long and fatiguing one. As I was\r\ndetermined to get on, I told the few men that remained that the chiefs\r\nhad behaved very badly, and that I should acquaint the Rajah with their\r\nconduct, and I wanted to start immediately. Every man present made some\r\nexcuse, but others were sent for, and by dint of threats and promises,\r\nand the exertion of all Bujon's eloquence, we succeeded in getting off\r\nafter two hours' delay.\r\n\r\nFor the first few miles our path lay over a country cleared for\r\nrice-fields, consisting entirely of small but deep and sharply-cut\r\nridges and valleys without a yard of level ground. After crossing the\r\nKayan river, a main branch of the Sadong, we got on to the lower slopes\r\nof the Seboran Mountain, and the path lay along a sharp and moderately\r\nsteep ridge, affording an excellent view of the country. Its features\r\nwere exactly those of the Himalayas in miniature, as they are described\r\nby Dr. Hooker and other travellers, and looked like a natural model\r\nof some parts of those vast mountains on a scale of about a\r\ntenth--thousands of feet being here represented by hundreds. I now\r\ndiscovered the source of the beautiful pebbles which had so pleased me\r\nin the riverbed. The slatey rocks had ceased, and these mountains seemed\r\nto consist of a sandstone conglomerate, which was in some places a mere\r\nmass of pebbles cemented together. I might have known that such small\r\nstreams could not produce such vast quantities of well-rounded pebbles\r\nof the very hardest materials. They had evidently been formed in past\r\nages, by the action of some continental stream or seabeach, before the\r\ngreat island of Borneo had risen from the ocean. The existence of such a\r\nsystem of hills and valleys reproducing in miniature all the features of\r\na great mountain region, has an important bearing on the modern theory\r\nthat the form of the ground is mainly due to atmospheric rather than\r\nto subterranean action. When we have a number of branching valleys and\r\nravines running in many different directions within a square mile,\r\nit seems hardly possible to impute their formation, or even their\r\norigination, to rents and fissures produced by earthquakes. On the other\r\nhand, the nature of the rock, so easily decomposed and removed by water,\r\nand the known action of the abundant tropical rains, are in this case,\r\nat least, quite sufficient causes for the production of such valleys.\r\nBut the resemblance between their forms and outlines, their mode of\r\ndivergence, and the slopes and ridges that divide them, and those of the\r\ngrand mountain scenery of the Himalayas, is so remarkable, that we are\r\nforcibly led to the conclusion that the forces at work in the two cases\r\nhave been the same, differing only in the time they have been in action,\r\nand the nature of the material they have had to work upon.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we reached the village of Menyerry, beautifully situated on\r\na spur of the mountain about 600 feet above the valley, and affording\r\na delightful view of the mountains of this part of Borneo. I here got a\r\nsight of Penrissen Mountain, at the head of the Sarawak River, and one\r\nof the highest in the district, rising to about 6,000 feet above the\r\nsea. To the south the Rowan, and further off the Untowan Mountains in\r\nthe Dutch territory appeared equally lofty. Descending from Menyerry we\r\nagain crossed the Kayan, which bends round the spur, and ascended to the\r\npass which divides the Sadong and Sarawak valleys, and which is about\r\n2,000 feet high. The descent from this point was very fine. A stream,\r\ndeep in a rocky gorge, rushed on each side of us, to one of which we\r\ngradually descended, passing over many lateral gullys and along the\r\nfaces of some precipices by means of native bamboo bridges. Some of\r\nthese were several hundred feet long and fifty or sixty high, a single\r\nsmooth bamboo four inches diameter forming the only pathway, while a\r\nslender handrail of the same material was often so shaky that it could\r\nonly be used as a guide rather than a support.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we reached Sodos, situated on a spur between two\r\nstreams, but so surrounded by fruit trees that little could be seen\r\nof the country. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the\r\npeople very obliging. Many of the women and children had never seen a\r\nwhite man before, and were very sceptical as to my being the same colour\r\nall over, as my face. They begged me to show them my arms and body, and\r\nthey were so kind and good-tempered that I felt bound to give them some\r\nsatisfaction, so I turned up my trousers and let them see the colour of\r\nmy leg, which they examined with great interest.\r\n\r\nIn the morning early we continued our descent along a fine valley, with\r\nmountains rising 2,000 or 3,000 feet in every direction. The little\r\nriver rapidly increased in size until we reached Senna, when it had\r\nbecome a fine pebbly stream navigable for small canoes. Here again the\r\nupheaved slatey rock appeared, with the same dip and direction as in the\r\nSadong River. On inquiring for a boat to take me down the stream, I was\r\ntold that the Senna Dyaks, although living on the river-banks, never\r\nmade or used boats. They were mountaineers who had only come down into\r\nthe valley about twenty years before, and had not yet got into new\r\nhabits. They are of the same tribe as the people of Menyerry and Sodos.\r\nThey make good paths and bridges, and cultivate much mountain land, and\r\nthus give a more pleasing and civilized aspect to the country than where\r\nthe people move about only in boats, and confine their cultivation to\r\nthe banks of the streams.\r\n\r\nAfter some trouble I hired a boat from a Malay trader, and found three\r\nDyaks who had been several times with Malays to Sarawak, and thought\r\nthey could manage it very well. They turned out very awkward, constantly\r\nrunning aground, striking against rocks, and losing their balance so as\r\nalmost to upset themselves and the boat--offering a striking contrast\r\nto the skill of the Sea Dyaks. At length we came to a really dangerous\r\nrapid where boats were often swamped, and my men were afraid to pass it.\r\nSome Malays with a boatload of rice here overtook us, and after safely\r\npassing down kindly sent back one of their men to assist me. As it was,\r\nmy Dyaks lost their balance in the critical part of the passage, and\r\nhad they been alone would certainly have upset the boat. The river now\r\nbecame exceedingly picturesque, the ground on each side being partially\r\ncleared for ricefields, affording a good view of the country. Numerous\r\nlittle granaries were built high up in trees overhanging the river, and\r\nhaving a bamboo bridge sloping up to them from the bank; and here and\r\nthere bamboo suspension bridge crossed the stream, where overhanging\r\ntrees favoured their construction.\r\n\r\nI slept that night in the village of the Sebungow Dyaks, and the next\r\nday reached Sarawak, passing through a most beautiful country where\r\nlimestone mountains with their fantastic forms and white precipices shot\r\nup on every side, draped and festooned with a luxuriant vegetation.\r\nThe banks of the Sarawak River are everywhere covered with fruit trees,\r\nwhich supply the Dyaks with a great deal of their food. The Mangosteen,\r\nLansat, Rambutan, Jack, Jambou, and Blimbing, are all abundant; but\r\nmost abundant and most esteemed is the Durian, a fruit about which very\r\nlittle is known in England, but which both by natives and Europeans\r\nin the Malay Archipelago is reckoned superior to all others. The old\r\ntraveller Linschott, writing in 1599, says: \"It is of such an excellent\r\ntaste that it surpasses in flavour all the other fruits of the world,\r\naccording to those who have tasted it.\" And Doctor Paludanus adds: \"This\r\nfruit is of a hot and humid nature. To those not used to it, it seems at\r\nfirst to smell like rotten onions, but immediately when they have tasted\r\nit, they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable\r\ntitles, exalt it, and make verses on it.\" When brought into a house the\r\nsmell is often so offensive that some persons can never bear to taste\r\nit. This was my own case when I first tried it in Malacca, but in Borneo\r\nI found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at\r\nonce became a confirmed Durian eater.\r\n\r\nThe Durian grows on a large and lofty forest tree, somewhat resembling\r\nan elm in its general character, but with a more smooth and scaly bark.\r\nThe fruit is round or slightly oval, about the size of a large cocoanut,\r\nof a green colour, and covered all over with short stout spines\r\nthe bases of which touch each other, and are consequently somewhat\r\nhexagonal, while the points are very strong and sharp. It is so\r\ncompletely armed, that if the stalk is broken off it is a difficult\r\nmatter to lift one from the ground. The outer rind is so thick and\r\ntough, that from whatever height it may fall it is never broken. From\r\nthe base to the apex five very faint lines may be traced, over which\r\nthe spines arch a little; these are the sutures of the carpels, and show\r\nwhere the fruit may be divided with a heavy knife and a strong hand.\r\nThe five cells are satiny white within, and are each filled with an oval\r\nmass of cream-coloured pulp, imbedded in which are two or three seeds\r\nabout the size of chestnuts. This pulp is the eatable part, and its\r\nconsistency and flavour are indescribable. A rich butter-like custard\r\nhighly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it,\r\nbut intermingled with it come wafts of flavour that call to mind\r\ncream-cheese, onion-sauce, brown sherry, and other incongruities. Then\r\nthere is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else\r\npossesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid, nor\r\nsweet, nor juicy; yet one feels the want of none of these qualities, for\r\nit is perfect as it is. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and\r\nthe more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact\r\nto eat Durians is a new sensation, worth a voyage to the East to\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruit is ripe it falls of itself, and the only way to eat\r\nDurians in perfection is to get them as they fall; and the smell is\r\nthen less overpowering. When unripe, it makes a very good vegetable if\r\ncooked, and it is also eaten by the Dyaks raw. In a good fruit season\r\nlarge quantities are preserved salted, in jars and bamboos, and kept the\r\nyear round, when it acquires a most disgusting odour to Europeans, but\r\nthe Dyaks appreciate it highly as a relish with their rice. There are in\r\nthe forest two varieties of wild Durians with much smaller fruits, one\r\nof them orange-coloured inside; and these are probably the origin of\r\nthe large and fine Durians, which are never found wild. It would not,\r\nperhaps, be correct to say that the Durian is the best of all fruits,\r\nbecause it cannot supply the place of the subacid juicy kinds, such as\r\nthe orange, grape, mango, and mangosteen, whose refreshing and cooling\r\nqualities are so wholesome and grateful; but as producing a food of the\r\nmost exquisite flavour, it is unsurpassed. If I had to fix on two only,\r\nas representing the perfection of the two classes, I should certainly\r\nchoose the Durian and the Orange as the king and queen of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe Durian is, however, sometimes dangerous. When the fruit begins to\r\nripen it falls daily and almost hourly, and accidents not unfrequently\r\nhappen to persons walking or working under the trees. When a Durian\r\nstrikes a man in its fall, it produces a dreadful wound, the strong\r\nspines tearing open the flesh, while the blow itself is very heavy; but\r\nfrom this very circumstance death rarely ensues, the copious effusion\r\nof blood preventing the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A\r\nDyak chief informed me that he had been struck down by a Durian falling\r\non his head, which he thought would certainly have caused his death, yet\r\nhe recovered in a very short time.\r\n\r\nPoets and moralists, judging from our English trees and fruits, have\r\nthought that small fruits always grew on lofty trees, so that their fall\r\nshould be harmless to man, while the large ones trailed on the ground.\r\nTwo of the largest and heaviest fruits known, however, the Brazil-nut\r\nfruit (Bertholletia) and Durian, grow on lofty forest trees, from which\r\nthey fall as soon as they are ripe, and often wound or kill the native\r\ninhabitants. From this we may learn two things: first, not to draw\r\ngeneral conclusions from a very partial view of nature; and secondly,\r\nthat trees and fruits, no less than the varied productions of the animal\r\nkingdom, do not appear to be organized with exclusive reference to the\r\nuse and convenience of man.\r\n\r\nDuring my many journeys in Borneo, and especially during my various\r\nresidences among the Dyaks, I first came to appreciate the admirable\r\nqualities of the Bamboo. In those parts of South America which I had\r\npreviously visited, these gigantic grasses were comparatively scarce;\r\nand where found but little used, their place being taken as to one class\r\nof uses by the great variety of Palms, and as to another by calabashes\r\nand gourds. Almost all tropical countries produce Bamboos, and wherever\r\nthey are found in abundance the natives apply them to a variety of\r\nuses. Their strength, lightness, smoothness, straightness, roundness and\r\nhollowness, the facility and regularity with which they can be split,\r\ntheir many different sizes, the varying length of their joints, the\r\nease with which they can be cut and with which holes can be made through\r\nthem, their hardness outside, their freedom from any pronounced taste\r\nor smell, their great abundance, and the rapidity of their growth and\r\nincrease, are all qualities which render them useful for a hundred\r\ndifferent purposes, to serve which other materials would require much\r\nmore labour and preparation. The Bamboo is one of the most wonderful\r\nand most beautiful productions of the tropics, and one of nature's most\r\nvaluable gifts to uncivilized man.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak houses are all raised on posts, and are often two or three\r\nhundred feet long and forty or fifty wide. The floor is always formed\r\nof strips split from large Bamboos, so that each may be nearly flat and\r\nabout three inches wide, and these are firmly tied down with rattan to\r\nthe joists beneath. When well made, this is a delightful floor to walk\r\nupon barefooted, the rounded surfaces of the bamboo being very smooth\r\nand agreeable to the feet, while at the same time affording a firm hold.\r\nBut, what is more important, they form with a mat over them an excellent\r\nbed, the elasticity of the Bamboo and its rounded surface being far\r\nsuperior to a more rigid and a flatter floor. Here we at once find a use\r\nfor Bamboo which cannot be supplied so well by another material without\r\na vast amount of labour--palms and other substitutes requiring much\r\ncutting and smoothing, and not being equally good when finished. When,\r\nhowever, a flat, close floor is required, excellent boards are made by\r\nsplitting open large Bamboos on one side only, and flattening them out\r\nso as to form slabs eighteen inches wide and six feet long, with which\r\nsome Dyaks floor their houses. These with constant rubbing of the feet\r\nand the smoke of years become dark and polished, like walnut or old oak,\r\nso that their real material can hardly be recognised. What labour is\r\nhere saved to a savage whose only tools are an axe and a knife, and who,\r\nif he wants boards, must hew them out of the solid trunk of a tree, and\r\nmust give days and weeks of labour to obtain a surface as smooth and\r\nbeautiful as the Bamboo thus treated affords him. Again, if a temporary\r\nhouse is wanted, either by the native in his plantation or by the\r\ntraveller in the forest, nothing is so convenient as the Bamboo, with\r\nwhich a house can be constructed with a quarter of the labour and time\r\nthan if other materials are used.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, the Hill Dyaks in the interior of Sarawak\r\nmake paths for long distances from village to village and to their\r\ncultivated grounds, in the course of which they have to cross many\r\ngullies and ravines, and even rivers; or sometimes, to avoid a long\r\ncircuit, to carry the path along the face of a precipice. In all these\r\ncases the bridges they construct are of Bamboo, and so admirably adapted\r\nis the material for this purpose, that it seems doubtful whether they\r\never would have attempted such works if they had not possessed it. The\r\nDyak bridge is simple but well designed. It consists merely of stout\r\nBamboos crossing each other at the road-way like the letter X, and\r\nrising a few feet above it. At the crossing they are firmly bound\r\ntogether, and to a large Bamboo which lays upon them and forms the only\r\npathway, with a slender and often very shaky one to serve as a handrail.\r\nWhen a river is to be crossed, an overhanging tree is chosen from which\r\nthe bridge is partly suspended and partly supported by diagonal struts\r\nfrom the banks, so as to avoid placing posts in the stream itself, which\r\nwould be liable to be carried away by floods. In carrying a path along\r\nthe face of a precipice, trees and roots are made use of for suspension;\r\nstruts arise from suitable notches or crevices in the rocks, and if\r\nthese are not sufficient, immense Bamboos fifty or sixty feet long are\r\nfixed on the banks or on the branch of a tree below. These bridges\r\nare traversed daily by men and women carrying heavy loads, so that any\r\ninsecurity is soon discovered, and, as the materials are close at hand,\r\nimmediately repaired. When a path goes over very steep ground, and\r\nbecomes slippery in very wet or very dry weather, the Bamboo is used\r\nin another way. Pieces are cut about a yard long, and opposite notches\r\nbeing made at each end, holes are formed through which pegs are driven,\r\nand firm and convenient steps are thus formed with the greatest ease and\r\ncelerity. It is true that much of this will decay in one or two seasons,\r\nbut it can be so quickly replaced as to make it more economical than\r\nusing a harder and more durable wood.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking uses to which Bamboo is applied by the Dyaks,\r\nis to assist them in climbing lofty trees by driving in pegs in the way\r\nI have already described at page 85. This method is constantly used in\r\norder to obtain wax, which is one of the most valuable products of the\r\ncountry. The honey-bee of Borneo very generally hangs its combs under\r\nthe branches of the Tappan, a tree which towers above all others in the\r\nforest, and whose smooth cylindrical trunk often rises a hundred feet\r\nwithout a branch. The Dyaks climb these lofty trees at night,\r\nbuilding up their Bamboo ladder as they go, and bringing down gigantic\r\nhoneycombs. These furnish them with a delicious feast of honey and young\r\nbees, besides the wax, which they sell to traders, and with the proceeds\r\nbuy the much-coveted brass wire, earrings, and bold-edged handkerchiefs\r\nwith which they love to decorate themselves. In ascending Durian and\r\nother fruit trees which branch at from thirty to fifty feet from the\r\nground, I have seen them use the Bamboo pegs only, without the upright\r\nBamboo which renders them so much more secure.\r\n\r\nThe outer rind of the Bamboo, split and shaved thin, is the strongest\r\nmaterial for baskets; hen-coops, bird-cages, and conical fish-traps\r\nare very quickly made from a single joint, by splitting off the skin in\r\nnarrow strips left attached to one end, while rings of the same material\r\nor of rattan are twisted in at regular distances. Water is brought to\r\nthe houses by little aqueducts formed of large Bamboos split in half\r\nand supported on crossed sticks of various heights so as to give it\r\na regular fall. Thin long-jointed Bamboos form the Dyaks' only\r\nwater-vessels, and a dozen of them stand in the corner of every house.\r\nThey are clean, light, and easily carried, and are in many ways superior\r\nto earthen vessels for the same purpose. They also make excellent\r\ncooking utensils; vegetables and rice can be boiled in them to\r\nperfection, and they are often used when travelling. Salted fruit or\r\nfish, sugar, vinegar, and honey are preserved in them instead of in jars\r\nor bottles. In a small Bamboo case, prettily carved and ornamented,\r\nthe Dyak carries his sirih and lime for betel chewing, and his little\r\nlong-bladed knife has a Bamboo sheath. His favourite pipe is a huge\r\nhubble-bubble, which he will construct in a few minutes by inserting a\r\nsmall piece of Bamboo for a bowl obliquely into a large cylinder about\r\nsix inches from the bottom containing water, through which the smoke\r\npasses to a long slender Bamboo tube. There are many other small matters\r\nfor which Bamboo is daily used, but enough has now been mentioned to\r\nshow its value. In other parts of the Archipelago I have myself seen it\r\napplied to many new uses, and it is probable that my limited means of\r\nobservation did not make me acquainted with one-half the ways in which\r\nit is serviceable to the Dyaks of Sarawak.\r\n\r\nWhile upon the subject of plants I may here mention a few of the more\r\nstriking vegetable productions of Borneo. The wonderful Pitcher-plants,\r\nforming the genus Nepenthes of botanists, here reach their greatest\r\ndevelopment. Every mountain-top abounds with them, running along\r\nthe ground, or climbing over shrubs and stunted trees; their elegant\r\npitchers hanging in every direction. Some of these are long and slender,\r\nresembling in form the beautiful Philippine lace-sponge (Euplectella),\r\nwhich has now become so common; others are broad and short. Their\r\ncolours are green, variously tinted and mottled with red or purple.\r\nThe finest yet known were obtained on the summit of Kini-balou, in\r\nNorth-west Borneo. One of the broad sort, Nepenthes rajah, will hold two\r\nquarts of water in its pitcher. Another, Nepenthes Edwardsiania, has\r\na narrow pitcher twenty inches long; while the plant itself grows to a\r\nlength of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nFerns are abundant, but are not so varied as on the volcanic mountains\r\nof Java; and Tree-ferns are neither so plentiful nor so large as on that\r\nisland. They grow, however, quite down to the level of the sea, and are\r\ngenerally slender and graceful plants from eight to fifteen feet high.\r\nWithout devoting much time to the search I collected fifty species of\r\nFerns in Borneo, and I have no doubt a good botanist would have obtained\r\ntwice the number. The interesting group of Orchids is very abundant,\r\nbut, as is generally the case, nine-tenths of the species have small\r\nand inconspicuous flowers. Among the exceptions are the fine Coelogynes,\r\nwhose large clusters of yellow flowers ornament the gloomiest\r\nforests, and that most extraordinary plant, Vanda Lowii, which last\r\nis particularly abundant near some hot springs at the foot of the\r\nPenin-jauh Mountain. It grows on the lower branches of trees, and its\r\nstrange pendant flower-spires often hang down so as almost to reach the\r\nground. These are generally six or eight feet long, bearing large and\r\nhandsome flowers three inches across, and varying in colour from orange\r\nto red, with deep purple-red spots. I measured one spike, which reached\r\nthe extraordinary length of nine feet eight inches, and bore thirty-six\r\nflowers, spirally arranged upon a slender thread-like stalk. Specimens\r\ngrown in our English hot-houses have produced flower-spires of equal\r\nlength, and with a much larger number of blossoms.\r\n\r\nFlowers were scarce, as is usual in equatorial forests, and it was only\r\nat rare intervals that I met with anything striking. A few fine\r\nclimbers were sometimes seen, especially a handsome crimson and yellow\r\nAeschynanthus, and a fine leguminous plant with clusters of large\r\nCassia-like flowers of a rich purple colour. Once I found a number\r\nof small Anonaceous trees of the genus Polyalthea, producing a most\r\nstriking effect in the gloomy forest shades. They were about thirty feet\r\nhigh, and their slender trunks were covered with large star-like crimson\r\nflowers, which clustered over them like garlands, and resembled some\r\nartificial decoration more than a natural product.\r\n\r\nThe forests abound with gigantic trees with cylindrical, buttressed, or\r\nfurrowed stems, while occasionally the traveller comes upon a wonderful\r\nfig-tree, whose trunk is itself a forest of stems and aerial roots.\r\nStill more rarely are found trees which appear to have begun growing in\r\nmid-air, and from the same point send out wide-spreading branches above\r\nand a complicated pyramid of roots descending for seventy or eighty feet\r\nto the ground below, and so spreading on every side, that one can stand\r\nin the very centre with the trunk of the tree immediately overhead.\r\nTrees of this character are found all over the Archipelago, and the\r\naccompanying illustration (taken from one which I often visited in the\r\nAru Islands) will convey some idea of their general character. I believe\r\nthat they originate as parasites, from seeds carried by birds and\r\ndropped in the fork of some lofty tree. Hence descend aerial roots,\r\nclasping and ultimately destroying the supporting tree, which is in time\r\nentirely replaced by the humble plant which was at first dependent upon\r\nit. Thus we have an actual struggle for life in the vegetable kingdom,\r\nnot less fatal to the vanquished than the struggles among animals which\r\nwe can so much more easily observe and understand. The advantage of\r\nquicker access to light and warmth and air, which is gained in one way\r\nby climbing plants, is here obtained by a forest tree, which has the\r\nmeans of starting in life at an elevation which others can only attain\r\nafter many years of growth, and then only when the fall of some other\r\ntree has made room for then. Thus it is that in the warm and moist and\r\nequable climate of the tropics, each available station is seized upon\r\nand becomes the means of developing new forms of life especially adapted\r\nto occupy it.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Sarawak early in December, I found there would not be an\r\nopportunity of returning to Singapore until the latter end of January.\r\nI therefore accepted Sir James Brooke's invitation to spend a week with\r\nhim and Mr. St. John at his cottage on Peninjauh. This is a very steep\r\npyramidal mountain of crystalline basaltic rock, about a thousand feet\r\nhigh, and covered with luxuriant forest. There are three Dyak villages\r\nupon it, and on a little platform near the summit is the rude wooden\r\nlodge where the English Rajah was accustomed to go for relaxation and\r\ncool fresh air. It is only twenty miles up the river, but the road\r\nup the mountain is a succession of ladders on the face of precipices,\r\nbamboo bridges over gullies and chasms, and slippery paths over rocks\r\nand tree-trunks and huge boulders as big as houses. A cool spring under\r\nan overhanging rock just below the cottage furnished us with refreshing\r\nbaths and delicious drinking water, and the Dyaks brought us daily\r\nheaped-up baskets of Mangosteens and Lansats, two of the most delicious\r\nof the subacid tropical fruits. We returned to Sarawak for Christmas\r\n(the second I had spent with Sir James Brooke), when all the Europeans\r\nboth in the town and from the out-stations enjoyed the hospitality of\r\nthe Rajah, who possessed in a pre-eminent degree the art of making every\r\none around him comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I returned to the mountain with Charles and a\r\nMalay boy named Ali and stayed there three weeks for the purpose of\r\nmaking a collection of land-shells, butterflies and moths, ferns and\r\norchids. On the hill itself ferns were tolerably plentiful, and I made\r\na collection of about forty species. But what occupied me most was\r\nthe great abundance of moths which on certain occasions I was able to\r\ncapture. As during the whole of my eight years' wanderings in the East\r\nI never found another spot where these insects were at all plentiful,\r\nit will be interesting to state the exact conditions under which I here\r\nobtained them.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the cottage there was a verandah, looking down the whole\r\nside of the mountain and to its summit on the right, all densely clothed\r\nwith forest. The boarded sides of the cottage were whitewashed, and the\r\nroof of the verandah was low, and also boarded and whitewashed. As soon\r\nas it got dark I placed my lamp on a table against the wall, and with\r\npins, insect-forceps, net, and collecting-boxes by my side, sat down\r\nwith a book. Sometimes during the whole evening only one solitary moth\r\nwould visit me, while on other nights they would pour in, in a continual\r\nstream, keeping me hard at work catching and pinning till past midnight.\r\nThey came literally by the thousands. These good nights were very few.\r\nDuring the four weeks that I spent altogether on the hill I only had\r\nfour really good nights, and these were always rainy, and the best\r\nof them soaking wet. But wet nights were not always good, for a rainy\r\nmoonlight night produced next to nothing. All the chief tribes of moths\r\nwere represented, and the beauty and variety of the species was very\r\ngreat. On good nights I was able to capture from a hundred to two\r\nhundred and fifty moths, and these comprised on each occasion from half\r\nto two-thirds that number of distinct species. Some of them would settle\r\non the wall, some on the table, while many would fly up to the roof and\r\ngive me a chase all over the verandah before I could secure them. In\r\norder to show the curious connection between the state of weather and\r\nthe degree in which moths were attracted to light, I add a list of my\r\ncaptures each night of my stay on the hill:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Date (1855)    No. of Moths     Remarks\r\n\r\n     Dec. 13th             1     Fine; starlight.\r\n          14th            75     Drizzly and fog.\r\n          15th            41     Showery; cloudy.\r\n          16th           158     (120 species.)

My success here led me to hope that, by similar arrangements, I\r\nmight on every island be able to obtain an abundance of these insects;\r\nbut, strange to say, during the six succeeding years, I was never once\r\nable to make any collections at all approaching those at Sarawak. The\r\nreason for this I can pretty well understand to be owing to the absence\r\nof some one or other essential condition that were here all combined.\r\nSometimes the dry season was the hindrance; more frequently residence\r\nin a town or village not close to virgin forest, and surrounded by other\r\nhouses whose lights were a counter-attraction; still more frequently\r\nresidence in a dark palm-thatched house, with a lofty roof, in whose\r\nrecesses every moth was lost the instant it entered. This last was the\r\ngreatest drawback, and the real reason why I never again was able to\r\nmake a collection of moths; for I never afterwards lived in a solitary\r\njungle-house with a low boarded and whitewashed verandah, so constructed\r\nas to prevent insects at once escaping into the upper part of the house,\r\nquite out of reach.\r\n\r\nAfter my long experience, my numerous failures, and my one success, I\r\nfeel sure that if any party of naturalists ever make a yacht-voyage to\r\nexplore the Malayan Archipelago, or any other tropical region, making\r\nentomology one of their chief pursuits, it would well repay them to\r\ncarry a small framed verandah, or a verandah-shaped tent of white\r\ncanvas, to set up in every favourable situation, as a means of making\r\na collection of nocturnal Lepidoptera, and also of obtaining rare\r\nspecimens of Coleoptera and other insects. I make the suggestion here,\r\nbecause no one would suspect the enormous difference in results that\r\nsuch an apparatus would produce; and because I consider it one of the\r\ncuriosities of a collector's experience, to have found out that some\r\nsuch apparatus is required.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Singapore I took with me the Malay lad named Ali,\r\nwho subsequently accompanied me all over the Archipelago. Charles\r\nAllen preferred staying at the Mission-house, and afterwards obtained\r\nemployment in Sarawak and in Singapore, until he again joined me four\r\nyears later at Amboyna in the Moluccas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. BORNEO--THE DYAKS.\r\n\r\nTHE manners and customs of the aborigines of Borneo have been described\r\nin great detail, and with much fuller information than I possess, in the\r\nwritings of Sir James Brooke, Messrs. Low, St. John, Johnson Brooke,\r\nand many others. I do not propose to go over the ground again, but shall\r\nconfine myself to a sketch, from personal observation, of the general\r\ncharacter of the Dyaks, and of such physical, moral, and social\r\ncharacteristics as have been less frequently noticed.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is closely allied to the Malay, and more remotely to the\r\nSiamese, Chinese, and other Mongol races. All these are characterised by\r\na reddish-brown or yellowish-brown skin of various shades, by jet-black\r\nstraight hair, by the scanty or deficient beard, by the rather small and\r\nbroad nose, and high cheekbones; but none of the Malayan races have the\r\noblique eyes which are characteristic of the more typical Mongols. The\r\naverage stature of the Dyaks is rather more than that of the Malays,\r\nwhile it is considerably under that of most Europeans. Their forms are\r\nwell proportioned, their feet and hands small, and they rarely or never\r\nattain the bulk of body so often seen in Malays and Chinese.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to rank the Dyaks above the Malays in mental capacity,\r\nwhile in moral character they are undoubtedly superior to them. They\r\nare simple and honest, and become the prey of the Malay and Chinese\r\ntraiders, who cheat and plunder them continually. They are more lively,\r\nmore talkative, less secretive, and less suspicious than the Malay,\r\nand are therefore pleasanter companions. The Malay boys have little\r\ninclination for active sports and games, which form quite a feature in\r\nthe life of the Dyak youths, who, besides outdoor games of skill and\r\nstrength, possess a variety of indoor amusements. One wet day, in a Dyak\r\nhouse, when a number of boys and young men were about me, I thought\r\nto amuse them with something new, and showed them how to make \"cat's\r\ncradle\" with a piece of string. Greatly to my surprise, they knew all\r\nabout it, and more than I did; for, after Charles and I had gone through\r\nall the changes we could make, one of the boys took it off my hand, and\r\nmade several new figures which quite puzzled me. They then showed me a\r\nnumber of other tricks with pieces of string, which seemed a favourite\r\namusement with them.\r\n\r\nEven these apparently trifling matters may assist us to form a truer\r\nestimate of the Dyaks' character and social condition. We learn thereby,\r\nthat these people have passed beyond that first stage of savage life in\r\nwhich the struggle for existence absorbs all of the faculties, and in\r\nwhich every thought and idea is connected with war or hunting, or the\r\nprovision for their immediate necessities. These amusements indicate a\r\ncapability of civilization, an aptitude to enjoy other than mere sensual\r\npleasures, which might be taken advantage of to elevate their whole\r\nintellectual and social life.\r\n\r\nThe moral character of the Dyaks is undoubtedly high--a statement which\r\nwill seem strange to those who have heard of them only as head-hunters\r\nand pirates. The Hill Dyaks of whom I am speaking, however, have never\r\nbeen pirates, since they never go near the sea; and head-hunting is a\r\ncustom originating in the petty wars of village with village, and tribe\r\nwith tribe, which no more implies a bad moral character than did the\r\ncustom of the slave-trade a hundred years ago imply want of general\r\nmorality in all who participated in it. Against this one stain on their\r\ncharacter (which in the case of the Sarawak Dyaks no longer exists)\r\nwe have to set many good points. They are truthful and honest to a\r\nremarkable degree. From this cause it is very often impossible to get\r\nfrom them any definite information, or even an opinion. They say, \"If\r\nI were to tell you what I don't know, I might tell a lie;\" and whenever\r\nthey voluntarily relate any matter of fact, you may be sure they are\r\nspeaking the truth. In a Dyak village the fruit trees have each their\r\nowner, and it has often happened to me, on asking an inhabitant to\r\ngather me some fruit, to be answered, \"I can't do that, for the owner of\r\nthe tree is not here;\" never seeming to contemplate the possibility of\r\nacting otherwise. Neither will they take the smallest thing belonging to\r\nan European. When living at Simunjon, they continually came to my house,\r\nand would pick up scraps of torn newspaper or crooked pins that I had\r\nthrown away, and ask as a great favour whether they might have them.\r\nCrimes of violence (other than head-hunting) are almost unknown; for\r\nin twelve years, under Sir James Brooke's rule, there had been only one\r\ncase of murder in a Dyak tribe, and that one was committed by a stranger\r\nwho had been adopted into the tribe. In several other matters of\r\nmorality they rank above most uncivilized, and even above many civilized\r\nnations. They are temperate in food and drink, and the gross sensuality\r\nof the Chinese and Malays is unknown among them. They have the usual\r\nfault of all people in a half-savage state--apathy and dilatoriness,\r\nbut, however annoying this may be to Europeans who come in contact\r\nwith them, it cannot be considered a very grave offence, or be held to\r\noutweigh their many excellent qualities.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence among the Hill Dyaks, I was much struck by the\r\napparent absence of those causes which are generally supposed to check\r\nthe increase of population, although there were plain indications\r\nof stationary or but slowly increasing numbers. The conditions most\r\nfavourable to a rapid increase of population are: an abundance of food,\r\na healthy climate, and early marriages. Here these conditions all exist.\r\nThe people produce far more food than they consume, and exchange the\r\nsurplus for gongs and brass cannon, ancient jars, and gold and silver\r\nornaments, which constitute their wealth. On the whole, they appear very\r\nfree from disease, marriages take place early (but not too early),\r\nand old bachelors and old maids are alike unknown. Why, then, we must\r\ninquire, has not a greater population been produced? Why are the Dyak\r\nvillages so small and so widely scattered, while nine-tenths of the\r\ncountry is still covered with forest?\r\n\r\nOf all the checks to population among savage nations mentioned by\r\nMalthus--starvation, disease, war, infanticide, immorality, and\r\ninfertility of the women--the last is that which he seems to think least\r\nimportant, and of doubtful efficacy; and yet it is the only one that\r\nseems to me capable of accounting for the state of the population among\r\nthe Sarawak Dyaks. The population of Great Britain increases so as to\r\ndouble itself in about fifty years. To do this it is evident that each\r\nmarried couple must average three children who live to be married at the\r\nage of about twenty-five. Add to these those who die in infancy, those\r\nwho never marry, or those who marry late in life and have no offspring,\r\nthe number of children born to each marriage must average four or five,\r\nand we know that families of seven or eight are very common, and of ten\r\nand twelve by no means rare. But from inquiries at almost every Dyak\r\ntribe I visited, I ascertained that the women rarely had more than three\r\nor four children, and an old chief assured me that he had never known a\r\nwoman to have more than seven.\r\n\r\nIn a village consisting of a hundred and fifty families, only one\r\nconsisted of six children living, and only six of five children, the\r\nmajority of families appearing to be two, three, or four. Comparing this\r\nwith the known proportions in European countries, it is evident that the\r\nnumber of children to each marriage can hardly average more than three\r\nor four; and as even in civilized countries half the population die\r\nbefore the age of twenty-five, we should have only two left to replace\r\ntheir parents; and so long as this state of things continued,\r\nthe population must remain stationary. Of course this is a mere\r\nillustration; but the facts I have stated seem to indicate that\r\nsomething of the kind really takes place; and if so, there is no\r\ndifficulty in understanding the smallness and almost stationary\r\npopulation of the Dyak tribes.\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire what is the cause of the small number of births\r\nand of living children in a family. Climate and race may have something\r\nto do with this, but a more real and efficient cause seems to me to\r\nbe the hard labour of the women, and the heavy weights they constantly\r\ncarry. A Dyak woman generally spends the whole day in the field, and\r\ncarries home every night a heavy load of vegetables and firewood, often\r\nfor several miles, over rough and hilly paths; and not unfrequently\r\nhas to climb up a rocky mountain by ladders, and over slippery\r\nstepping-stones, to an elevation of a thousand feet. Besides this, she\r\nhas an hour's work every evening to pound the rice with a heavy wooden\r\nstamper, which violently strains every part of the body. She begins this\r\nkind of labour when nine or ten years old, and it never ceases but with\r\nthe extreme decrepitude of age. Surely we need not wonder at the limited\r\nnumber of her progeny, but rather be surprised at the successful efforts\r\nof nature to prevent the extermination of the race.\r\n\r\nOne of the surest and most beneficial effects of advancing civilization,\r\nwill be the amelioration of the condition of these women. The\r\nprecept and example of higher races will make the Dyak ashamed of his\r\ncomparatively idle life, while his weaker partner labours like a beast\r\nof burthen. As his wants become increased and his tastes refined, the\r\nwomen will have more household duties to attend to, and will then cease\r\nto labour in the field--a change which has already to a great extent\r\ntaken place in the allied Malay, Javanese, and Bugis tribes. Population\r\nwill then certainly increase more rapidly, improved systems of\r\nagriculture and some division of labour will become necessary in order\r\nto provide the means of existence, and a more complicated social state\r\nwill take the place of the simple conditions of society which now occur\r\namong them. But, with the sharper struggle for existence that will\r\nthen arise, will the happiness of the people as a whole be increased\r\nor diminished? Will not evil passions be aroused by the spirit of\r\ncompetition, and crimes and vices, now unknown or dormant, be called\r\ninto active existence? These are problems that time alone can solve; but\r\nit is to be hoped that education and a high-class European example may\r\nobviate much of the evil that too often arises in analogous cases, and\r\nthat we may at length be able to point to one instance of an uncivilized\r\npeople who have not become demoralized, and finally exterminated, by\r\ncontact with European civilization.\r\n\r\nA few words in conclusion, about the government of Sarawak. Sir James\r\nBrooke found the Dyaks oppressed and ground down by the most cruel\r\ntyranny. They were cheated by the Malay traders and robbed by the Malay\r\nchiefs. Their wives and children were often captured and sold into\r\nslavery, and hostile tribes purchased permission from their cruel rulers\r\nto plunder, enslave, and murder them. Anything like justice or redress\r\nfor these injuries was utterly unattainable. From the time Sir James\r\nobtained possession of the country, all this was stopped. Equal justice\r\nwas awarded to Malay, Chinaman, and Dyak. The remorseless pirates from\r\nthe rivers farther east were punished, and finally shut up within their\r\nown territories, and the Dyak, for the first time, could sleep in peace.\r\nHis wife and children were now safe from slavery; his house was no\r\nlonger burned over his head; his crops and his fruits were now his own\r\nto sell or consume as he pleased. And the unknown stranger who had done\r\nall this for them, and asked for nothing in return, what could he be?\r\nHow was it possible for them to realize his motives? Was it not natural\r\nthat they should refuse to believe he was a man? For of pure benevolence\r\ncombined with great power, they had had no experience among men. They\r\nnaturally concluded that he was a superior being, come down upon earth\r\nto confer blessings on the afflicted. In many villages where he had not\r\nbeen seen, I was asked strange questions about him. Was he not as old\r\nas the mountains? Could he not bring the dead to life? And they firmly\r\nbelieve that he can give them good harvests, and make their fruit-trees\r\nbear an abundant crop.\r\n\r\nIn forming a proper estimate of Sir James Brooke's government it must\r\never be remembered that he held Sarawak solely by the goodwill of the\r\nnative inhabitant. He had to deal with two races, one of whom, the\r\nMahometan Malays, looked upon the other race, the Dyaks, as savages\r\nand slaves, only fit to be robbed and plundered. He has effectually\r\nprotected the Dyaks, and has invariably treated them as, in his sight,\r\nequal to the Malays; and yet he has secured the affection and goodwill\r\nof both. Notwithstanding the religious prejudice, of Mahometans, he\r\nhas induced them to modify many of their worst laws and customs, and to\r\nassimilate their criminal code to that of the civilized world. That his\r\ngovernment still continues, after twenty-seven years--notwithstanding\r\nhis frequent absences from ill-health, notwithstanding conspiracies of\r\nMalay chiefs, and insurrections of Chinese gold-diggers, all of\r\nwhich have been overcome by the support of the native population, and\r\nnotwithstanding financial, political, and domestic troubles is due, I\r\nbelieve, solely to the many admirable qualities which Sir James Brooke\r\npossessed, and especially to his having convinced the native population,\r\nby every action of his life, that he ruled them, not for his own\r\nadvantage, but for their good.\r\n\r\nSince these lines were written, his noble spirit has passed away.\r\nBut though, by those who knew him not, he may be sneered at as an\r\nenthusiastic adventurer, abused as a hard-hearted despot, the universal\r\ntestimony of everyone who came in contact with him in his adopted\r\ncountry, whether European, Malay, or Dyak, will be, that Rajah Brooke\r\nwas a great, a wise, and a good ruler; a true and faithful friend--a man\r\nto be admired for his talents, respected for his honesty and courage,\r\nand loved for his genuine hospitality, his kindness of disposition, and\r\nhis tenderness of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. JAVA.\r\n\r\nI SPENT three months and a half in Java, from July 18th to October 31st,\r\n1861, and shall briefly describe my own movements, and my observations\r\nof the people and the natural history of the country. To all those who\r\nwish to understand how the Dutch now govern Java, and how it is that\r\nthey are enabled to derive a large annual revenue from it, while the\r\npopulation increases, and the inhabitants are contented, I recommend the\r\nstudy of Mr. Money's excellent and interesting work, \"How to Manage a\r\nColony.\" The main facts and conclusions of that work I most heartily\r\nconcur in, and I believe that the Dutch system is the very best that\r\ncan be adopted, when a European nation conquers or otherwise acquires\r\npossession of a country inhabited by an industrious but semi-barbarous\r\npeople. In my account of Northern Celebes, I shall show how successfully\r\nthe same system has been applied to a people in a very different state\r\nof civilization from the Javanese; and in the meanwhile will state in\r\nthe fewest words possible what that system is.\r\n\r\nThe mode of government now adopted in Java is to retain the whole series\r\nof native rulers, from the village chief up to princes, who, under the\r\nname of Regents, are the heads of districts about the size of a\r\nsmall English county. With each Regent is placed a Dutch Resident, or\r\nAssistant Resident, who is considered to be his \"elder brother,\" and\r\nwhose \"orders\" take the form of \"recommendations,\" which are, however,\r\nimplicitly obeyed. Along with each Assistant Resident is a Controller,\r\na kind of inspector of all the lower native rulers, who periodically\r\nvisits every village in the district, examines the proceedings of the\r\nnative courts, hears complaints against the head-men or other native\r\nchiefs, and superintends the Government plantations. This brings us to\r\nthe \"culture system,\" which is the source of all the wealth the Dutch\r\nderive from Java, and is the subject of much abuse in this country\r\nbecause it is the reverse of \"free trade.\" To understand its uses and\r\nbeneficial effects, it is necessary first to sketch the common results\r\nof free European trade with uncivilized peoples.\r\n\r\nNatives of tropical climates have few wants, and, when these are\r\nsupplied, are disinclined to work for superfluities without some strong\r\nincitement. With such a people the introduction of any new or systematic\r\ncultivation is almost impossible, except by the despotic orders of\r\nchiefs whom they have been accustomed to obey, as children obey their\r\nparents. The free competition of European traders, however introduces\r\ntwo powerful inducements to exertion. Spirits or opium is a temptation\r\ntoo strong for most savages to resist, and to obtain these he will sell\r\nwhatever he has, and will work to get more. Another temptation he cannot\r\nresist, is goods on credit. The trader offers him gay cloths, knives,\r\ngongs, guns, and gunpowder, to be paid for by some crop perhaps not\r\nyet planted, or some product yet in the forest. He has not sufficient\r\nforethought to take only a moderate quantity, and not enough energy to\r\nwork early and late in order to get out of debt; and the consequence is\r\nthat he accumulates debt upon debt, and often remains for years, or\r\nfor life, a debtor and almost a slave. This is a state of things\r\nwhich occurs very largely in every part of the world in which men of a\r\nsuperior race freely trade with men of a lower race. It extends trade\r\nno doubt for a time, but it demoralizes the native, checks true\r\ncivilization--and does not lead to any permanent increase in the wealth\r\nof the country; so that the European government of such a country must\r\nbe carried on at a loss.\r\n\r\nThe system introduced by the Dutch was to induce the people, through\r\ntheir chiefs, to give a portion of their time, to the cultivation of\r\ncoffee, sugar, and other valuable products. A fixed rate of wages--low\r\nindeed, but, about equal to that of all places where European\r\ncompetition has not artificially raised it--was paid to the labourers\r\nengaged in clearing the ground and forming the plantations under\r\nGovernment superintendence. The produce is sold to the Government at a\r\nlow, fixed price. Out of the net profit a percentage goes to the chiefs,\r\nand the remainder is divided among the workmen. This surplus in good\r\nyears is something considerable. On the whole, the people are well fed\r\nand decently clothed, and have acquired habits of steady industry and\r\nthe art of scientific cultivation, which must be of service to them in\r\nthe future. It must be remembered, that the Government expended capital\r\nfor years before any return was obtained; and if they now derive a large\r\nrevenue, it is in a way which is far less burthensome, and far more\r\nbeneficial to the people, than any tax that could be levied.\r\n\r\nBut although the system may be a good one, and as well adapted to the\r\ndevelopment of arts and industry in a half civilized people as it is\r\nto the material advantage of the governing country, it is not pretended\r\nthat in practice it is perfectly carried out. The oppressive and servile\r\nrelations between chiefs and people, which have continued for perhaps a\r\nthousand years, cannot be at once abolished; and some evil must result\r\nfrom those relations, until the spread of education and the gradual\r\ninfusion of European blood causes it naturally and insensibly to\r\ndisappear. It is said that the Residents, desirous of showing a large\r\nincrease in the products of their districts, have sometimes pressed the\r\npeople to such continued labour on the plantations that their rice crops\r\nhave been materially diminished, and famine has been the result. If this\r\nhas happened, it is certainly not a common thing, and is to be set down\r\nto the abuse of the system, by the want of judgment, or want of humanity\r\nin the Resident.\r\n\r\nA tale has lately been written in Holland, and translated into English,\r\nentitled \"Max Havelaar;\" or, the \"Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading\r\nCompany,\" and with our usual one-sidedness in all relating to the Dutch\r\nColonial System, this work has been excessively praised, both for its\r\nown merits, and for its supposed crushing exposure of the iniquities of\r\nthe Dutch government of Java. Greatly to my surprise, I found it a very\r\ntedious and long-winded story, full of rambling digressions; and whose\r\nonly point is to show that the Dutch Residents and Assistant Residents\r\nwink at the extortions of the native princes; and that in some districts\r\nthe natives have to do work without payment, and have their goods taken\r\naway from them without compensation. Every statement of this kind is\r\nthickly interspersed with italics and capital letters; but as the names\r\nare all fictitious, and neither dates, figures, nor details are\r\never given, it is impossible to verify or answer them. Even if not\r\nexaggerated, the facts stated are not nearly so bad as those of the\r\noppression by free-trade indigo-planters, and torturing by native\r\ntax-gatherers under British rule in India, with which the readers of\r\nEnglish newspapers were familiar a few years ago. Such oppression,\r\nhowever, is not fairly to be imputed in either case to the particular\r\nform of government, but is rather due to the infirmity of human nature,\r\nand to the impossibility of at once destroying all trace of ages of\r\ndespotism on the one side, and of slavish obedience to their chiefs on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, that the complete establishment of the Dutch\r\npower in Java is much more recent than that of our rule in India, and\r\nthat there have been several changes of government, and in the mode of\r\nraising revenue. The inhabitants have been so recently under the rule\r\nof their native princes, that it is not easy at once to destroy the\r\nexcessive reverence they feel for their old masters, or to diminish the\r\noppressive exactions which the latter have always been accustomed to\r\nmake. There is, however, one grand test of the prosperity, and even\r\nof the happiness, of a community, which we can apply here--the rate of\r\nincrease of the population.\r\n\r\nIt is universally admitted that when a country increases rapidly in\r\npopulation, the people cannot be very greatly oppressed or very badly\r\ngoverned. The present system of raising a revenue by the cultivation of\r\ncoffee and sugar, sold to Government at a fixed price, began in 1832.\r\nJust before this, in 1826, the population by census was 5,500,000, while\r\nat the beginning of the century it was estimated at 3,500,000. In 1850,\r\nwhen the cultivation system had been in operation eighteen years, the\r\npopulation by census was over 9,500,000, or an increase of 73 per\r\ncent in twenty-four years. At the last census, in 1865, it amounted to\r\n14,168,416, an increase of very nearly 50 per cent in fifteen years--a\r\nrate which would double the population in about twenty-six years. As\r\nJava (with Madura) contains about 38,500 geographical square miles, this\r\nwill give an average of 368 persons to the square mile, just double that\r\nof the populous and fertile Bengal Presidency as given in Thornton's\r\nGazetteer of India, and fully one-third more than that of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland at the last Census. If, as I believe, this vast population\r\nis on the whole contented and happy, the Dutch Government should\r\nconsider well before abruptly changing a system which has led to such\r\ngreat results.\r\n\r\nTaking it as a whole, and surveying it from every point of view, Java\r\nis probably the very finest and most interesting tropical island in the\r\nworld. It is not first in size, but it is more than 600 miles long, and\r\nfrom 60 to 120 miles wide, and in area is nearly equal to England; and\r\nit is undoubtedly the most fertile, the most productive, and the most\r\npopulous island within the tropics. Its whole surface is magnificently\r\nvaried with mountain and forest scenery. It possesses thirty-eight\r\nvolcanic mountains, several of which rise to ten or twelve thousand feet\r\nhigh. Some of these are in constant activity, and one or other of them\r\ndisplays almost every phenomenon produced by the action of subterranean\r\nfires, except regular lava streams, which never occur in Java. The\r\nabundant moisture and tropical heat of the climate causes these\r\nmountains to be clothed with luxuriant vegetation, often to their very\r\nsummits, while forests and plantations cover their lower slopes. The\r\nanimal productions, especially the birds and insects, are beautiful\r\nand varied, and present many peculiar forms found nowhere else upon the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe soil throughout the island is exceedingly fertile, and all the\r\nproductions of the tropics, together with many of the temperate zones,\r\ncan be easily cultivated. Java too possesses a civilization, a history\r\nand antiquities of its own, of great interest. The Brahminical religion\r\nflourished in it from an epoch of unknown antiquity until about the\r\nyear 1478, when that of Mahomet superseded it. The former religion\r\nwas accompanied by a civilization which has not been equalled by the\r\nconquerors; for, scattered through the country, especially in the\r\neastern part of it, are found buried in lofty forests, temples, tombs,\r\nand statues of great beauty and grandeur; and the remains of extensive\r\ncities, where the tiger, the rhinoceros, and the wild bull now roam\r\nundisturbed. A modern civilization of another type is now spreading over\r\nthe land. Good roads run through the country from end to end; European\r\nand native rulers work harmoniously together; and life and property are\r\nas well secured as in the best governed states of Europe. I believe,\r\ntherefore, that Java may fairly claim to be the finest tropical island\r\nin the world, and equally interesting to the tourist seeking after\r\nnew and beautiful scenes; to the naturalist who desires to examine\r\nthe variety and beauty of tropical nature; or to the moralist and the\r\npolitician who want to solve the problem of how man may be best governed\r\nunder new and varied conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch mail steamer brought me from Ternate to Sourabaya, the chief\r\ntown and port in the eastern part of Java, and after a fortnight spent\r\nin packing up and sending off my last collections, I started on a short\r\njourney into the interior. Travelling in Java is very luxurious but very\r\nexpensive, the only way being to hire or borrow a carriage, and then pay\r\nhalf a crown a mile for post-horses, which are changed at regular posts\r\nevery six miles, and will carry you at the rate of ten miles an hour\r\nfrom one end of the island to the other. Bullock carts or coolies are\r\nrequired to carry all extra baggage. As this kind of travelling would\r\nnot suit my means, I determined on making only a short journey to\r\nthe district at the foot of Mount Arjuna, where I was told there were\r\nextensive forests, and where I hoped to be able to make some good\r\ncollections. The country for many miles behind Sourabaya is perfectly\r\nflat and everywhere cultivated; being a delta or alluvial plain, watered\r\nby many branching streams. Immediately around the town the evident signs\r\nof wealth and of an industrious population were very pleasing; but as\r\nwe went on, the constant succession of open fields skirted by rows of\r\nbamboos, with here and there the white buildings and a tall chimney of\r\na sugar-mill, became monotonous. The roads run in straight lines\r\nfor several miles at a stretch, and are bordered by rows of dusty\r\ntamarind-trees. At each mile there are little guardhouses, where a\r\npoliceman is stationed; and there is a wooden gong, which by means of\r\nconcerted signals may be made to convey information over the country\r\nwith great rapidity. About every six or seven miles is the post-house,\r\nwhere the horses are changed as quickly as were those of the mail in the\r\nold coaching days in England.\r\n\r\nI stopped at Modjo-kerto, a small town about forty miles south of\r\nSourabaya, and the nearest point on the high road to the district\r\nI wished to visit. I had a letter of introduction to Mr. Ball, an\r\nEnglishman, long resident in Java and married to a Dutch lady; and he\r\nkindly invited me to stay with him until I could fix on a place to suit\r\nme. A Dutch Assistant Resident as well as a Regent or native Javanese\r\nprince lived here. The town was neat, and had a nice open grassy space\r\nlike a village green, on which stood a magnificent fig-tree (allied to\r\nthe Banyan of India, but more lofty), under whose shade a kind of market\r\nis continually held, and where the inhabitants meet together to lounge\r\nand chat. The day after my arrival, Mr. Ball drove me over to the\r\nvillage of Modjo-agong, where he was building a house and premises\r\nfor the tobacco trade, which is carried on here by a system of native\r\ncultivation and advance purchase, somewhat similar to the indigo trade\r\nin British India. On our way we stayed to look at a fragment of the\r\nruins of the ancient city of Modjo-pahit, consisting of two lofty brick\r\nmasses, apparently the sides of a gateway. The extreme perfection and\r\nbeauty of the brickwork astonished me. The bricks are exceedingly fine\r\nand hard, with sharp angles and true surfaces. They are laid with\r\ngreat exactness, without visible mortar or cement, yet somehow fastened\r\ntogether so that the joints are hardly perceptible, and sometimes the\r\ntwo surfaces coalesce in a most incomprehensible manner.\r\n\r\nSuch admirable brickwork I have never seen before or since. There was no\r\nsculpture here, but an abundance of bold projections and finely-worked\r\nmouldings. Traces of buildings exist for many miles in every direction,\r\nand almost every road and pathway shows a foundation of brickwork\r\nbeneath it--the paved roads of the old city. In the house of the Waidono\r\nor district chief at Modjo-agong, I saw a beautiful figure carved in\r\nhigh relief out of a block of lava, and which had been found buried in\r\nthe ground near the village. On my expressing a wish to obtain some\r\nsuch specimen, Mr. B. asked the chief for it, and much to my surprise he\r\nimmediately gave it me. It represented the Hindu goddess Durga, called\r\nin Java, Lora Jong-grang (the exalted virgin). She has eight arms, and\r\nstands on the back of a kneeling bull. Her lower right hand holds the\r\ntail of the bull, while the corresponding left hand grasps the hair of a\r\ncaptive, Dewth Mahikusor, the personification of vice, who has attempted\r\nto slay her bull. He has a cord round his waist, and crouches at her\r\nfeet in an attitude of supplication. The other hands of the goddess\r\nhold, on her right side, a double hook or small anchor, a broad straight\r\nsword, and a noose of thick cord; on her left, a girdle or armlet of\r\nlarge beads or shells, an unstrung bow, and a standard or war flag. This\r\ndeity was a special favourite among the old Javanese, and her image is\r\noften found in the ruined temples which abound in the eastern part of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe specimen I had obtained was a small one, about two feet high,\r\nweighing perhaps a hundredweight; and the next day we had it conveyed to\r\nModjo-Kerto to await my return to Sourabaya. Having decided to stay some\r\ntime at Wonosalem, on the lower slopes of the Arjuna Mountain, where\r\nI was informed I should find forest and plenty of game, I had first to\r\nobtain a recommendation from the Assistant Resident to the Regent, and\r\nthen an order from the Regent to the Waidono; and when after a week's\r\ndelay I arrived with my baggage and men at Modjo-agong, I found them all\r\nin the midst of a five days' feast, to celebrate the circumcision of\r\nthe Waidono's younger brother and cousin, and had a small room in an\r\non outhouse given me to stay in. The courtyard and the great open\r\nreception-shed were full of natives coming and going and making\r\npreparations for a feast which was to take place at midnight, to which I\r\nwas invited, but preferred going to bed. A native band, or Gamelang, was\r\nplaying almost all the evening, and I had a good opportunity of seeing\r\nthe instruments and musicians. The former are chiefly gongs of various\r\nsizes, arranged in sets of from eight to twelve, on low wooden frames.\r\nEach set is played by one performer with one or two drumsticks. There\r\nare also some very large gongs, played singly or in pairs, and taking\r\nthe place of our drums and kettledrums. Other instruments are formed by\r\nbroad metallic bars, supported on strings stretched across frames; and\r\nothers again of strips of bamboo similarly placed and producing\r\nthe highest notes. Besides these there were a flute and a curious\r\ntwo-stringed violin, requiring in all twenty-four performers. There was\r\na conductor, who led off and regulated the time, and each performer\r\ntook his part, coming in occasionally with a few bars so as to form a\r\nharmonious combination. The pieces played were long and complicated,\r\nand some of the players were mere boys, who took their parts with great\r\nprecision. The general effect was very pleasing, but, owing to the\r\nsimilarity of most of the instruments, more like a gigantic musical\r\nbox than one of our bands; and in order to enjoy it thoroughly it is\r\nnecessary to watch the large number of performers who are engaged in it.\r\nThe next morning, while I was waiting for the men and horses who were to\r\ntake me and my baggage to my destination, the two lads, who were about\r\nfourteen years old, were brought out, clothed in a sarong from the waist\r\ndownwards, and having the whole body covered with yellow powder, and\r\nprofusely decked with white blossom in wreaths, necklaces, and armlets,\r\nlooking at first sight very like savage brides. They were conducted by\r\ntwo priests to a bench placed in front of the house in the open air,\r\nand the ceremony of circumcision was then performed before the assembled\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nThe road to Wonosalem led through a magnificent forest in the depths of\r\nwhich we passed a fine ruin of what appeared to have been a royal tomb\r\nor mausoleum. It is formed entirely of stone, and elaborately carved.\r\nNear the base is a course of boldly projecting blocks, sculptured in\r\nhigh relief, with a series of scenes which are probably incidents in\r\nthe life of the defunct. These are all beautifully executed, some of\r\nthe figures of animals in particular, being easily recognisable and very\r\naccurate. The general design, as far as the ruined state of the upper\r\npart will permit of its being seen, is very good, effect being given\r\nby an immense number and variety of projecting or retreating courses\r\nof squared stones in place of mouldings. The size of this structure\r\nis about thirty feet square by twenty high, and as the traveller comes\r\nsuddenly upon it on a small elevation by the roadside, overshadowed by\r\ngigantic trees, overrun with plants and creepers, and closely backed by\r\nthe gloomy forest, he is struck by the solemnity and picturesque beauty\r\nof the scene, and is led to ponder on the strange law of progress, which\r\nlooks so like retrogression, and which in so many distant parts of the\r\nworld has exterminated or driven out a highly artistic and constructive\r\nrace, to make room for one which, as far as we can judge, is very far\r\nits inferior.\r\n\r\nFew Englishmen are aware of the number and beauty of the architectural\r\nremains in Java. They have never been popularly illustrated or\r\ndescribed, and it will therefore take most persons by surprise to learn\r\nthat they far surpass those of Central America, perhaps even those of\r\nIndia. To give some idea of these ruins, and perchance to excite\r\nwealthy amateurs to explore them thoroughly and obtain by photography an\r\naccurate record of their beautiful sculptures before it is too late, I\r\nwill enumerate the most important, as briefly described in Sir Stamford\r\nRaffles' \"History of Java.\"\r\n\r\nBRAMBANAM.--Near the centre of Java, between the native capitals of\r\nDjoko-kerta and Surakerta, is the village of Brambanam, near which are\r\nabundance of ruins, the most important being the temples of Loro-Jongran\r\nand Chandi Sewa. At Loro-Jongran there were twenty separate buildings,\r\nsix large and fourteen small temples. They are now a mass of ruins, but\r\nthe largest temples are supposed to have been ninety feet high. They\r\nwere all constructed of solid stone, everywhere decorated with carvings\r\nand bas-reliefs, and adorned with numbers of statues, many of which\r\nstill remain entire. At Chandi Sewa, or the \"Thousand Temples,\" are many\r\nfine colossal figures. Captain Baker, who surveyed these ruins, said he\r\nhad never in his life seen \"such stupendous and finished specimens of\r\nhuman labour, and of the science and taste of ages long since forgot,\r\ncrowded together in so small a compass as in this spot.\" They cover a\r\nspace of nearly six hundred feet square, and consist of an outer row\r\nof eighty-four small temples, a second row of seventy-six, a third\r\nof sixty-four, a fourth of forty-four, and the fifth forming an inner\r\nparallelogram of twenty-eight, in all two hundred and ninety-six small\r\ntemples; disposed in five regular parallelograms. In the centre is\r\na large cruciform temple surrounded by lofty flights of steps richly\r\nornamented with sculpture, and containing many apartments. The tropical\r\nvegetation has ruined most of the smaller temples, but some remain\r\ntolerably perfect, from which the effect of the whole may be imagined.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile off is another temple, called Chandi Kali Bening,\r\nseventy-two feet square and sixty feet high, in very fine preservation,\r\nand covered with sculptures of Hindu mythology surpassing any that exist\r\nin India, other ruins of palaces, halls, and temples, with abundance of\r\nsculptured deities, are found in the same neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBOROBODO.--About eighty miles westward, in the province of Kedu, is the\r\ngreat temple of Borobodo. It is built upon a small hill, and consists of\r\na central dome and seven ranges of terraced walls covering the slope\r\nof the hill and forming open galleries each below the other, and\r\ncommunicating by steps and gateways. The central dome is fifty feet in\r\ndiameter; around it is a triple circle of seventy-two towers, and the\r\nwhole building is six hundred and twenty feet square, and about\r\none hundred feet high. In the terrace walls are niches containing\r\ncross-legged figures larger than life to the number of about four\r\nhundred, and both sides of all the terrace walls are covered with\r\nbas-reliefs crowded with figures, and carved in hard stone and which\r\nmust therefore occupy an extent of nearly three miles in length! The\r\namount of human labour and skill expended on the Great Pyramid of Egypt\r\nsinks into insignificance when compared with that required to complete\r\nthis sculptured hill-temple in the interior of Java.\r\n\r\nGUNONG PRAU.--About forty miles southwest of Samarang, on a mountain\r\ncalled Gunong Prau, an extensive plateau is covered with ruins. To reach\r\nthese temples, four flights of stone steps were made up the mountain\r\nfrom opposite directions, each flight consisting of more than a thousand\r\nsteps. Traces of nearly four hundred temples have been found here, and\r\nmany (perhaps all) were decorated with rich and delicate sculptures.\r\nThe whole country between this and Brambanam, a distance of sixty miles,\r\nabounds with ruins, so that fine sculptured images may be seen lying in\r\nthe ditches, or built into the walls of enclosures.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of Java, at Kediri and in Malang, there are equally\r\nabundant traces of antiquity, but the buildings themselves have been\r\nmostly destroyed. Sculptured figures, however, abound; and the ruins of\r\nforts, palaces, baths, aqueducts, and temples, can be everywhere traced.\r\nIt is altogether contrary to the plan of this book to describe what I\r\nhave not myself seen; but, having been led to mention them, I felt bound\r\nto do something to call attention to these marvellous works of art. One\r\nis overwhelmed by the contemplation of these innumerable sculptures,\r\nworked with delicacy and artistic feeling in a hard, intractable,\r\ntrachytic rock, and all found in one tropical island. What could have\r\nbeen the state of society, what the amount of population, what the\r\nmeans of subsistence which rendered such gigantic works possible, will,\r\nperhaps, ever remain a mystery; and it is a wonderful example of the\r\npower of religious ideas in social life, that in the very country where,\r\nfive hundred years ago, these grand works were being yearly executed,\r\nthe inhabitants now only build rude houses of bamboo and thatch, and\r\nlook upon these relics of their forefathers with ignorant amazement,\r\nas the undoubted productions of giants or of demons. It is much to be\r\nregretted that the Dutch Government does not take vigorous steps for\r\nthe preservation of these ruins from the destroying agency of tropical\r\nvegetation; and for the collection of the fine sculptures which are\r\neverywhere scattered over the land.\r\n\r\nWonosalem is situated about a thousand feet above the sea, but\r\nunfortunately it is at a distance from the forest, and is surrounded by\r\ncoffee plantations, thickets of bamboo, and coarse grasses. It was too\r\nfar to walk back daily to the forest, and in other directions I could\r\nfind no collecting ground for insects. The place was, however, famous\r\nfor peacocks, and my boy soon shot several of these magnificent birds,\r\nwhose flesh we found to be tender, white, and delicate, and similar to\r\nthat of a turkey. The Java peacock is a different species from that of\r\nIndia, the neck being covered with scale-like green feathers, and the\r\ncrest of a different form; but the eyed train is equally large and\r\nequally beautiful. It is a singular fact in geographical distribution\r\nthat the peacock should not be found in Sumatra or Borneo, while the\r\nsuperb Argus, Fire-backed and Ocellated pheasants of those islands are\r\nequally unknown in Java. Exactly parallel is the fact that in Ceylon\r\nand Southern India, where the peacock abounds, there are none of the\r\nsplendid Lophophori and other gorgeous pheasants which inhabit Northern\r\nIndia. It would seem as if the peacock can admit of no rivals in its\r\ndomain. Were these birds rare in their native country, and unknown alive\r\nin Europe, they would assuredly be considered as the true princes of the\r\nfeathered tribes, and altogether unrivalled for stateliness and beauty.\r\nAs it is, I suppose scarcely anyone if asked to fix upon the most\r\nbeautiful bird in the world would name the peacock, any more than the\r\nPapuan savage or the Bugis trader would fix upon the bird of paradise\r\nfor the same honour.\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival at Wonosalem, my friend Mr. Ball came to pay\r\nme a visit. He told me that two evenings before, a boy had been killed\r\nand eaten by a tiger close to Modjo-agong. He was riding on a cart drawn\r\nby bullocks, and was coming home about dusk on the main road; and when\r\nnot half a mile from the village a tiger sprang upon him, carried him\r\noff into the jungle close by, and devoured him. Next morning his remains\r\nwere discovered, consisting only of a few mangled bones. The Waidono had\r\ngot together about seven hundred men, and were in chase of the animal,\r\nwhich, I afterwards heard, they found and killed. They only use spears\r\nwhen in pursuit of a tiger in this way. They surround a large tract of\r\ncountry, and draw gradually together until the animal is enclosed in a\r\ncompact ring of armed men. When he sees there is no escape he generally\r\nmakes a spring, and is received on a dozen spears, and almost instantly\r\nstabbed to death. The skin of an animal thus killed is, of course,\r\nworthless, and in this case the skull, which I had begged Mr. Ball to\r\nsecure for me, was hacked to pieces to divide the teeth, which are worn\r\nas charms.\r\n\r\nAfter a week at Wonosalem, I returned to the foot of the mountain, to\r\na village named Djapannan, which was surrounded by several patches of\r\nforest, and seemed altogether pretty well suited to my pursuits. The\r\nchief of the village had prepared two small bamboo rooms on one side of\r\nhis own courtyard to accommodate me, and seemed inclined to assist me\r\nas much as he could. The weather was exceedingly hot and dry, no rain\r\nhaving fallen for several months, and there was, in consequence, a great\r\nscarcity of insects, and especially of beetles. I therefore devoted\r\nmyself chiefly to obtaining a good set of the birds, and succeeded in\r\nmaking a tolerable collection. All the peacocks we had hitherto shot\r\nhad had short or imperfect tails, but I now obtained two magnificent\r\nspecimens more than seven feet long, one of which I preserved entire,\r\nwhile I kept the train only attached to the tail of two or three others.\r\nWhen this bird is seen feeding on the ground, it appears wonderful\r\nhow it can rise into the air with such a long and cumbersome train of\r\nfeathers. It does so however with great ease, by running quickly for a\r\nshort distance, and then rising obliquely; and will fly over trees of a\r\nconsiderable height. I also obtained here a specimen of the rare green\r\njungle-fowl (Gallus furcatus), whose back and neck are beautifully\r\nscaled with bronzy feathers, and whose smooth-edged oval comb is of\r\na violet purple colour, changing to green at the base. It is also\r\nremarkable in possessing a single large wattle beneath its throat,\r\nbrightly coloured in three patches of red, yellow, and blue. The common\r\njungle-cock (Gallus bankiva) was also obtained here. It is almost\r\nexactly like a common game-cock, but the voice is different, being much\r\nshorter and more abrupt; hence its native name is Bekeko. Six different\r\nkinds of woodpeckers and four kingfishers were found here, the fine\r\nhornbill, Buceros lunatus, more than four feet long, and the pretty\r\nlittle lorikeet, Loriculus pusillus, scarcely more than as many inches.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as I was preparing and arranging specimens, I was told\r\nthere was to be a trial; and presently four or five men came in and\r\nsquatted down on a mat under the audience-shed in the court. The chief\r\nthen came in with his clerk, and sat down opposite them. Each spoke\r\nin turn, telling his own tale, and then I found that those who first\r\nentered were the prisoner, accuser, policemen, and witness, and that\r\nthe prisoner was indicated solely by having a loose piece of cord twined\r\naround his wrists, but not tied. It was a case of robbery, and after the\r\nevidence was given, and a few questions had been asked by the chief, the\r\naccused said a few words, and then sentence was pronounced, which was\r\na fine. The parties then got up and walked away together, seeming quite\r\nfriendly; and throughout there was nothing in the manner of any one\r\npresent indicating passion or ill-feeling--a very good illustration of\r\nthe Malayan type of character.\r\n\r\nIn a month's collecting at Wonosalem and Djapannan I accumulated\r\nninety-eight species of birds, but a most miserable lot of insects. I\r\nthen determined to leave East Java and try the more moist and luxuriant\r\ndistricts at the western extremity of the island. I returned to\r\nSourabaya by water, in a roomy boat which brought myself, servants, and\r\nbaggage at one-fifth the expense it had cost me to come to Modjo-kerto.\r\nThe river has been rendered navigable by being carefully banked up,\r\nbut with the usual effect of rendering the adjacent country liable\r\noccasionally to severe floods. An immense traffic passes down this\r\nriver; and at a lock we passed through, a mile of laden boats were\r\nwaiting two or three deep, which pass through in their turn six at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I went by steamer to Batavia, where I stayed about\r\na week at the chief hotel, while I made arrangements for a trip into\r\nthe interior. The business part of the city is near the harbour, but the\r\nhotels and all the residences of the officials and European merchants\r\nare in a suburb two miles off, laid out in wide streets and squares\r\nso as to cover a great extent of ground. This is very inconvenient\r\nfor visitors, as the only public conveyances are handsome two-horse\r\ncarriages, whose lowest charge is five guilders (8s. 4d.) for half\r\na day, so that an hour's business in the morning and a visit in the\r\nevening costs 16s. 8d. a day for carriage hire alone.\r\n\r\nBatavia agrees very well with Mr. Money's graphic account of it, except\r\nthat his \"clear canals\" were all muddy, and his \"smooth gravel drives\"\r\nup to the houses were one and all formed of coarse pebbles, very painful\r\nto walk upon, and hardly explained by the fact that in Batavia everybody\r\ndrives, as it can hardly be supposed that people never walk in their\r\ngardens. The Hôtel des Indes was very comfortable, each visitor having\r\na sitting-room and bedroom opening on a verandah, where he can take his\r\nmorning coffee and afternoon tea. In the centre of the quadrangle is a\r\nbuilding containing a number of marble baths always ready for use; and\r\nthere is an excellent table d'hôte breakfast at ten, and dinner at six,\r\nfor all which there is a moderate charge per day.\r\n\r\nI went by coach to Buitenzorg, forty miles inland and about a thousand\r\nfeet above the sea, celebrated for its delicious climate and its\r\nBotanical Gardens. With the latter I was somewhat disappointed. The\r\nwalks were all of loose pebbles, making any lengthened wanderings about\r\nthem very tiring and painful under a tropical sun. The gardens are no\r\ndoubt wonderfully rich in tropical and especially in Malayan plants, but\r\nthere is a great absence of skillful laying-out; there are not enough\r\nmen to keep the place thoroughly in order, and the plants themselves\r\nare seldom to be compared for luxuriance and beauty to the same species\r\ngrown in our hothouses. This can easily be explained. The plants can\r\nrarely be placed in natural or very favourable conditions. The climate\r\nis either too hot or too cool, too moist or too dry, for a large\r\nproportion of them, and they seldom get the exact quantity of shade\r\nor the right quality of soil to suit them. In our stoves these varied\r\nconditions can be supplied to each individual plant far better than in a\r\nlarge garden, where the fact that the plants are most of them growing in\r\nor near their native country is supposed to preclude, the necessity of\r\ngiving them much individual attention. Still, however, there is much to\r\nadmire here. There are avenues of stately palms, and clumps of bamboos\r\nof perhaps fifty different kinds; and an endless variety of tropical\r\nshrubs and trees with strange and beautiful foliage. As a change from\r\nthe excessive heat of Batavia, Buitenzorg is a delightful abode. It is\r\njust elevated enough to have deliciously cool evenings and nights, but\r\nnot so much as to require any change of clothing; and to a person long\r\nresident in the hotter climate of the plains, the air is always fresh\r\nand pleasant, and admits of walking at almost any hour of the day. The\r\nvicinity is most picturesque and luxuriant, and the great volcano\r\nof Gunung Salak, with its truncated and jagged summit, forms a\r\ncharacteristic background to many of the landscapes. A great mud\r\neruption took place in 1699, since which date the mountain has been\r\nentirely inactive.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Buitenzorg, I had coolies to carry my baggage and a horse\r\nfor myself, both to be changed every six or seven miles. The road rose\r\ngradually, and after the first stage the hills closed in a little on\r\neach side, forming a broad valley; and the temperature was so cool and\r\nagreeable, and the country so interesting, that I preferred walking.\r\nNative villages imbedded in fruit trees, and pretty villas inhabited by\r\nplanters or retired Dutch officials, gave this district a very pleasing\r\nand civilized aspect; but what most attracted my attention was the\r\nsystem of terrace-cultivation, which is here universally adopted, and\r\nwhich is, I should think, hardly equalled in the world. The slopes of\r\nthe main valley, and of its branches, were everywhere cut in terraces up\r\nto a considerable height, and when they wound round the recesses of the\r\nhills produced all the effect of magnificent amphitheatres. Hundreds of\r\nsquare miles of country are thus terraced, and convey a striking idea\r\nof the industry of the people and the antiquity of their civilization.\r\nThese terraces are extended year by year as the population increases, by\r\nthe inhabitants of each village working in concert under the direction\r\nof their chiefs; and it is perhaps by this system of village culture\r\nalone, that such extensive terracing and irrigation has been rendered\r\npossible. It was probably introduced by the Brahmins from India,\r\nsince in those Malay countries where there is no trace of a previous\r\noccupation by a civilized people, the terrace system is unknown. I first\r\nsaw this mode of cultivation in Bali and Lombock, and, as I shall have\r\nto describe it in some detail there (see CHAPTER X.), I need say no more\r\nabout it in this place, except that, owing to the finer outlines and\r\ngreater luxuriance of the country in West Java, it produces there the\r\nmost striking and picturesque effect. The lower slopes of the mountains\r\nin Java possess such a delightful climate and luxuriant soil; living is\r\nso cheap and life and property are so secure, that a considerable\r\nnumber of Europeans who have been engaged in Government service, settle\r\npermanently in the country instead of returning to Europe. They are\r\nscattered everywhere throughout the more accessible parts of the island,\r\nand tend greatly to the gradual improvement of the native population,\r\nand to the continued peace and prosperity of the whole country.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles beyond Buitenzorg the post road passes over the Megamendong\r\nMountain, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet. The country is finely\r\nmountainous, and there is much virgin forest still left upon the hills,\r\ntogether with some of the oldest coffee-plantations in Java, where the\r\nplants have attained almost the dimensions of forest trees. About 500\r\nfeet below the summit level of the pass there is a road-keeper's hut,\r\nhalf of which I hired for a fortnight, as the country looked promising\r\nfor making collections. I almost immediately found that the productions\r\nof West Java were remarkably different from those of the eastern part of\r\nthe island; and that all the more remarkable and characteristic Javanese\r\nbirds and insects were to be found here. On the very first day, my\r\nhunters obtained for me the elegant yellow and green trogon (Harpactes\r\nReinwardti), the gorgeous little minivet flycatcher (Pericrocotus\r\nminiatus), which looks like a flame of fire as it flutters among the\r\nbushes, and the rare and curious black and crimson oriole (Analcipus\r\nsanguinolentus), all of these species which are found only in Java, and\r\neven seem to be confined to its western portion.\r\n\r\nIn a week I obtained no less than twenty-four species of birds, which I\r\nhad not found in the east of the island, and in a fortnight this number\r\nincreased to forty species, almost all of which are peculiar to the\r\nJavanese fauna. Large and handsome butterflies were also tolerably\r\nabundant. In dark ravines, and occasionally on the roadside, I captured\r\nthe superb Papilio arjuna, whose wings seem powdered with grains of\r\ngolden green, condensed into bands and moon-shaped spots; while the\r\nelegantly-formed Papilio coön was sometimes to be found fluttering\r\nslowly along the shady pathways (see figure at page 201). One day a boy\r\nbrought me a butterfly between his fingers, perfectly unhurt. He had\r\ncaught it as it was sitting with wings erect, sucking up the liquid from\r\na muddy spot by the roadside. Many of the finest tropical butterflies\r\nhave this habit, and they are generally so intent upon their meal that\r\nthey can be easily be reached and captured. It proved to be the rare and\r\ncurious Charaxes kadenii, remarkable for having on each hind wing two\r\ncurved tails like a pair of callipers. It was the only specimen I\r\never saw, and is still the only representative of its kind in English\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nIn the east of Java I had suffered from the intense heat and drought of\r\nthe dry season, which had been very inimical to insect life. Here I had\r\ngot into the other extreme of damp, wet, and cloudy weather, which was\r\nequally unfavourable. During the month which I spent in the interior\r\nof West Java, I never had a really hot fine day throughout. It rained\r\nalmost every afternoon, or dense mists came down from the mountains,\r\nwhich equally stopped collecting, and rendered it most difficult to dry\r\nmy specimens, so that I really had no chance of getting a fair sample of\r\nJavanese entomology.\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting incident in my visit to Java was a trip to\r\nthe summit of the Pangerango and Gedeh mountains; the former an extinct\r\nvolcanic cone about 10,000 feet high, the latter an active crater on a\r\nlower portion of the same mountain range. Tchipanas, about four miles\r\nover the Megamendong Pass, is at the foot of the mountain. A small\r\ncountry house for the Governor-General and a branch of the Botanic\r\nGardens are situated here, the keeper of which accommodated me with a\r\nbed for a night. There are many beautiful trees and shrubs planted\r\nhere, and large quantities of European vegetables are grown for the\r\nGovernor-General's table. By the side of a little torrent that bordered\r\nthe garden, quantities of orchids were cultivated, attached to the\r\ntrunks of trees, or suspended from the branches, forming an interesting\r\nopen air orchid-house. As I intended to stay two or three nights on the\r\nmountain, I engaged two coolies to carry my baggage, and with my two\r\nhunters we started early the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe first mile was over open country, which brought us to the forest\r\nthat covers the whole mountain from a height of about 5,000 feet. The\r\nnext mile or two was a tolerably steep ascent through a grand virgin\r\nforest, the trees being of great size, and the undergrowth consisting of\r\nfine herbaceous plants, tree-ferns, and shrubby vegetation. I was struck\r\nby the immense number of ferns that grew by the side of the road. Their\r\nvariety seemed endless, and I was continually stopping to admire some\r\nnew and interesting forms. I could now well understand what I had\r\nbeen told by the gardener, that 300 species had been found on this\r\none mountain. A little before noon we reached the small plateau of\r\nTjiburong, at the foot of the steeper part of the mountain, where there\r\nis a plank-house for the accommodation of travellers. Close by is a\r\npicturesque waterfall and a curious cavern, which I had not time to\r\nexplore. Continuing our ascent the road became narrow, rugged and steep,\r\nwinding zigzag up the cone, which is covered with irregular masses of\r\nrock, and overgrown with a dense luxuriant but less lofty vegetation.\r\nWe passed a torrent of water which is not much lower than the boiling\r\npoint, and has a most singular appearance as it foams over its rugged\r\nbed, sending up clouds of steam, and often concealed by the overhanging\r\nherbage of ferns and lycopodia, which here thrive with more luxuriance\r\nthan elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt about 7,500 feet we came to another hut of open bamboos, at a place\r\ncalled Kandang Badak, or \"Rhinoceros-field,\" which we were going to\r\nmake our temporary abode. Here was a small clearing, with abundance of\r\ntree-ferns and some young plantations of Cinchona. As there was now a\r\nthick mist and drizzling rain, I did not attempt to go on to the summit\r\nthat evening, but made two visits to it during my stay, as well as\r\none to the active crater of Gedeh. This is a vast semicircular chasm,\r\nbounded by black perpendicular walls of rock, and surrounded by miles\r\nof rugged scoria-covered slopes. The crater itself is not very deep. It\r\nexhibits patches of sulphur and variously-coloured volcanic products,\r\nand emits from several vents continual streams of smoke and vapour. The\r\nextinct cone of Pangerango was to me more interesting. The summit is\r\nan irregular undulating plain with a low bordering ridge, and one deep\r\nlateral chasm. Unfortunately, there was perpetual mist and rain either\r\nabove or below us all the time I was on the mountain; so that I never\r\nonce saw the plain below, or had a glimpse of the magnificent view which\r\nin fine weather is to be obtained from its summit. Notwithstanding this\r\ndrawback I enjoyed the excursion exceedingly, for it was the first\r\ntime I had been high enough on a mountain near the Equator to watch the\r\nchange from a tropical to a temperate flora. I will now briefly sketch\r\nthese changes as I observed them in Java.\r\n\r\nOn ascending the mountain, we first meet with temperate forms of\r\nherbaceous plants, so low as 3,000 feet, where strawberries and violets\r\nbegin to grow, but the former are tasteless, and the latter have very\r\nsmall and pale flowers. Weedy composites also begin to give a European\r\naspect to the wayside herbage. It is between 2,000 and 5,000 feet that\r\nthe forests and ravines exhibit the utmost development of tropical\r\nluxuriance and beauty. The abundance of noble Tree-ferns, sometimes\r\nfifty feet high, contributes greatly to the general effect, since of all\r\nthe forms of tropical vegetation they are certainly the most striking\r\nand beautiful. Some of the deep ravines which have been cleared of large\r\ntimber are full of them from top to bottom; and where the road crosses\r\none of these valleys, the view of their feathery crowns, in varied\r\npositions above and below the eye, offers a spectacle of picturesque\r\nbeauty never to be forgotten. The splendid foliage of the broad-leaved\r\nMusaceae and Zingiberaceae, with their curious and brilliant flowers;\r\nand the elegant and varied forms of plants allied to Begonia and\r\nMelastoma, continually attract the attention in this region. Filling in\r\nthe spaces between the trees and larger plants, on every trunk and stump\r\nand branch, are hosts of Orchids, Ferns and Lycopods, which wave and\r\nhang and intertwine in ever-varying complexity. At about 5,000 feet I\r\nfirst saw horsetails (Equisetum), very like our own species. At 6,000\r\nfeet, raspberries abound, and thence to the summit of the mountain there\r\nare three species of eatable Rubus. At 7,000 feet Cypresses appear, and\r\nthe forest trees become reduced in size, and more covered with mosses\r\nand lichens. From this point upward these rapidly increase, so that the\r\nblocks of rock and scoria that form the mountain slope are completely\r\nhidden in a mossy vegetation. At about 5,000 feet European forms of\r\nplants become abundant. Several species of Honeysuckle, St. John's-wort,\r\nand Guelder-rose abound, and at about 9,000 feet we first meet with the\r\nrare and beautiful Royal Cowslip (Primula imperialis), which is said to\r\nbe found nowhere else in the world but on this solitary mountain summit.\r\nIt has a tall, stout stem, sometimes more than three feet high, the\r\nroot leaves are eighteen inches long, and it bears several whorls of\r\ncowslip-like flowers, instead of a terminal cluster only. The forest\r\ntrees, gnarled and dwarfed to the dimensions of bushes, reach up to the\r\nvery rim of the old crater, but do not extend over the hollow on its\r\nsummit. Here we find a good deal of open ground, with thickets of\r\nshrubby Artemisias and Gnaphaliums, like our southernwood and cudweed,\r\nbut six or eight feet high; while Buttercups, Violets, Whortleberries,\r\nSow-thistles, Chickweed, white and yellow Cruciferae, Plantain, and\r\nannual grasses everywhere abound. Where there are bushes and shrubs,\r\nthe St. John's-wort and Honeysuckle grow abundantly, while the Imperial\r\nCowslip only exhibits its elegant blossoms under the damp shade of the\r\nthickets.\r\n\r\nMr. Motley, who visited the mountain in the dry season, and paid much\r\nattention to botany, gives the following list of genera of European\r\nplants found on or near the summit:-- Two species of Violet, three of\r\nRanunculus, three of Impatiens, eight or ten of Rubus, and species of\r\nPrimula, Hypericum, Swertia, Convallaria (Lily of the Valley), Vaccinium\r\n(Cranberry), Rhododendron, Gnaphalium, Polygonum, Digitalis (Foxglove),\r\nLonicera (Honeysuckle), Plantago (Rib-grass), Artemisia (Wormwood),\r\nLobelia, Oxalis (Wood-sorrel), Quercus (Oak), and Taxus (Yew). A few of\r\nthe smaller plants (Plantago major and lanceolata, Sonchus oleraceus,\r\nand Artemisia vulgaris) are identical with European species.\r\n\r\nThe fact of a vegetation so closely allied to that of Europe occurring\r\non isolated mountain peaks, in an island south of the Equator, while all\r\nthe lowlands for thousands of miles around are occupied by a flora of\r\na totally different character, is very extraordinary; and has only\r\nrecently received an intelligible explanation. The Peak of Teneriffe,\r\nwhich rises to a greater height and is much nearer to Europe, contains\r\nno such Alpine flora; neither do the mountains of Bourbon and\r\nMauritius. The case of the volcanic peaks of Java is therefore somewhat\r\nexceptional, but there are several analogous, if not exactly parallel\r\ncases, that will enable us better to understand in what way the\r\nphenomena may possibly have been brought about.\r\n\r\nThe higher peaks of the Alps, and even of the Pyrenees, contain a number\r\nof plants absolutely identical with those of Lapland, but nowhere found\r\nin the intervening plains. On the summit of the White Mountains, in\r\nthe United States, every plant is identical with species growing in\r\nLabrador. In these cases all ordinary means of transport fail. Most of\r\nthe plants have heavy seeds, which could not possibly be carried such\r\nimmense distances by the wind; and the agency of birds in so effectually\r\nstocking these Alpine heights is equally out of the question. The\r\ndifficulty was so great, that some naturalists were driven to believe\r\nthat these species were all separately created twice over on these\r\ndistant peaks. The determination of a recent glacial epoch, however,\r\nsoon offered a much more satisfactory solution, and one that is now\r\nuniversally accepted by men of science. At this period, when the\r\nmountains of Wales were full of glaciers, and the mountainous parts\r\nof Central Europe, and much of America north of the great lakes, were\r\ncovered with snow and ice, and had a climate resembling that of Labrador\r\nand Greenland at the present day, an Arctic flora covered all these\r\nregions. As this epoch of cold passed away, and the snowy mantle of the\r\ncountry, with the glaciers that descended from every mountain summit,\r\nreceded up their slopes and towards the north pole, the plants receded\r\nalso, always clinging as now to the margins of the perpetual snow line.\r\nThus it is that the same species are now found on the summits of the\r\nmountains of temperate Europe and America, and in the barren north-polar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nBut there is another set of facts, which help us on another step towards\r\nthe case of the Javanese mountain flora. On the higher slopes of\r\nthe Himalayas, on the tops of the mountains of Central India and of\r\nAbyssinia, a number of plants occur which, though not identical with\r\nthose of European mountains, belong to the same genera, and are said by\r\nbotanists to represent them; and most of these could not exist in the\r\nwarm intervening plains. Mr. Darwin believes that this class of facts\r\ncan be explained in the same way; for, during the greatest severity of\r\nthe glacial epoch, temperate forms of plants will have extended to the\r\nconfines of the tropics, and on its departure, will have retreated up\r\nthese southern mountains, as well as northward to the plains and hills\r\nof Europe. But in this case, the time elapsed, and the great change of\r\nconditions, have allowed many of these plants to become so modified that\r\nwe now consider them to be distinct species. A variety of other facts\r\nof a similar nature have led him to believe that the depression of\r\ntemperature was at one time sufficient to allow a few north-temperate\r\nplants to cross the Equator (by the most elevated routes) and to reach\r\nthe Antarctic regions, where they are now found. The evidence on which\r\nthis belief rests will be found in the latter part of CHAPTER II. of the\r\n\"Origin of Species\"; and, accepting it for the present as an hypothesis,\r\nit enables us to account for the presence of a flora of European type on\r\nthe volcanoes of Java.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, naturally be objected that there is a wide expanse\r\nof sea between Java and the continent, which would have effectually\r\nprevented the immigration of temperate forms of plants during the\r\nglacial epoch. This would undoubtedly be a fatal objection, were there\r\nnot abundant evidence to show that Java has been formerly connected with\r\nAsia, and that the union must have occurred at about the epoch required.\r\nThe most striking proof of such a junction is, that the great Mammalia\r\nof Java, the rhinoceros, the tiger, and the Banteng or wild ox, occur\r\nalso in Siam and Burmah, and these would certainly not have been\r\nintroduced by man. The Javanese peacock and several other birds are\r\nalso common to these two countries; but, in the majority of cases,\r\nthe species are distinct, though closely allied, indicating that a\r\nconsiderable time (required for such modification) has elapsed since the\r\nseparation, while it has not been so long as to cause an entire change.\r\nNow this exactly corresponds with the time we should require since the\r\ntemperate forms of plants entered Java. These are now almost distinct\r\nspecies, but the changed conditions under which they are now forced to\r\nexist, and the probability of some of them having since died out on the\r\ncontinent of India, sufficiently accounts for the Javanese species being\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nIn my more special pursuits, I had very little success upon the\r\nmountain--owing, perhaps, to the excessively unpropitious weather and\r\nthe shortness of my stay. At from 7,000 to 8,000 feet elevation, I\r\nobtained one of the most lovely of the small Fruit pigeons (Ptilonopus\r\nroseicollis), whose entire head and neck are of an exquisite rosy pink\r\ncolour, contrasting finely with its otherwise green plumage; and on the\r\nvery summit, feeding on the ground among the strawberries that have\r\nbeen planted there, I obtained a dull-coloured thrush, with the form\r\nand habits of a starling (Turdus fumidus). Insects were almost entirely\r\nabsent, owing no doubt to the extreme dampness, and I did not get a\r\nsingle butterfly the whole trip; yet I feel sure that, during the\r\ndry season, a week's residence on this mountain would well repay the\r\ncollector in every department of natural history.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Toego, I endeavoured to find another locality to\r\ncollect in, and removed to a coffee-plantation some miles to the north,\r\nand tried in succession higher and lower stations on the mountain; but,\r\nI never succeeded in obtaining insects in any abundance and birds were\r\nfar less plentiful than on the Megamendong Mountain. The weather now\r\nbecame more rainy than ever, and as the wet season seemed to have set\r\nin in earnest, I returned to Batavia, packed up and sent off my\r\ncollections, and left by steamer on November 1st for Banca and Sumatra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. SUMATRA.\r\n\r\n (NOVEMBER 1861 to JANUARY 1862.)\r\n\r\nThe mail steamer from Batavia to Singapore took me to Muntok (or as on\r\nEnglish maps, \"Minto\"), the chief town and port of Banca. Here I stayed\r\na day or two, until I could obtain a boat to take me across the straits,\r\nand up the river to Palembang. A few walks into the country showed me\r\nthat it was very hilly, and full of granitic and laterite rocks, with a\r\ndry and stunted forest vegetation; and I could find very few insects.\r\nA good-sized open sailing-boat took me across to the mouth of the\r\nPalembang river where, at a fishing village, a rowing-boat was hired to\r\ntake me up to Palembang--a distance of nearly a hundred miles by water.\r\nExcept when the wind was strong and favourable we could only proceed\r\nwith the tide, and the banks of the river were generally flooded\r\nNipa-swamps, so that the hours we were obliged to lay at anchor passed\r\nvery heavily. Reaching Palembang on the 8th of November, I was lodged\r\nby the Doctor, to whom I had brought a letter of introduction, and\r\nendeavoured to ascertain where I could find a good locality for\r\ncollecting. Everyone assured me that I should have to go a very long way\r\nfurther to find any dry forest, for at this season the whole country\r\nfor many miles inland was flooded. I therefore had to stay a week at\r\nPalembang before I could determine my future movements.\r\n\r\nThe city is a large one, extending for three or four miles along a fine\r\ncurve of the river, which is as wide as the Thames at Greenwich. The\r\nstream is, however, much narrowed by the houses which project into it\r\nupon piles, and within these, again, there is a row of houses built upon\r\ngreat bamboo rafts, which are moored by rattan cables to the shore or to\r\npiles, and rise and fall with the tide.\r\n\r\nThe whole riverfront on both sides is chiefly formed of such houses, and\r\nthey are mostly shops open to the water, and only raised a foot above\r\nit, so that by taking a small boat it is easy to go to market and\r\npurchase anything that is to be had in Palembang. The natives are true\r\nMalays, never building a house on dry land if they can find water to set\r\nit in, and never going anywhere on foot if they can reach the place in\r\na boat. A considerable portion of the population are Chinese and Arabs,\r\nwho carry on all the trade; while the only Europeans are the civil and\r\nmilitary officials of the Dutch Government. The town is situated at the\r\nhead of the delta of the river, and between it and the sea there is\r\nvery little ground elevated above highwater mark; while for many\r\nmiles further inland, the banks of the main stream and its numerous\r\ntributaries are swampy, and in the wet season flooded for a considerable\r\ndistance. Palembang is built on a patch of elevated ground, a few miles\r\nin extent, on the north bank of the river. At a spot about three miles\r\nfrom the town this turns into a little hill, the top of which is held\r\nsacred by the natives, shaded by some fine trees, and inhabited by a\r\ncolony of squirrels which have become half-tame. On holding out a few\r\ncrumbs of bread or any fruit, they come running down the trunk, take\r\nthe morsel out of your fingers, and dart away instantly. Their tails\r\nare carried erect, and the hair, which is ringed with grey, yellow, and\r\nbrown, radiates uniformly around them, and looks exceedingly pretty.\r\nThey have somewhat of the motions of mice, coming on with little starts,\r\nand gazing intently with their large black eyes before venturing to\r\nadvance further. The manner in which Malays often obtain the confidence\r\nof wild animals is a very pleasing trait in their character, and is due\r\nin some degree to the quiet deliberation of their manners, and their\r\nlove of repose rather than of action. The young are obedient to the\r\nwishes of their elders, and seem to feel none of that propensity to\r\nmischief which European boys exhibit. How long would tame squirrels\r\ncontinue to inhabit trees in the vicinity of an English village, even\r\nif close to the church? They would soon be pelted and driven away, or\r\nsnared and confined in a whirling cage. I have never heard of these\r\npretty animals being tamed in this way in England, but I should think it\r\nmight be easily done in any gentleman's park, and they would certainly\r\nbe as pleasing and attractive as they would be uncommon.\r\n\r\nAfter many inquiries, I found that a day's journey by water above\r\nPalembang there commenced a military road which extended up to the\r\nmountains and even across to Bencoolen, and I determined to take this\r\nroute and travel on until I found some tolerable collecting ground.\r\nBy this means I should secure dry land and a good road, and avoid the\r\nrivers, which at this season are very tedious to ascend owing to the\r\npowerful currents, and very unproductive to the collector owing to most\r\nof the lands in their vicinity being underwater. Leaving early in the\r\nmorning we did not reach Lorok, the village where the road begins, until\r\nlate at night. I stayed there a few days, but found that almost all the\r\nground in the vicinity not underwater was cultivated, and that the only\r\nforest was in swamps which were now inaccessible. The only bird new\r\nto me which I obtained at Lorok was the fine long-tailed parroquet\r\n(Palaeornis longicauda). The people here assured me that the country was\r\njust the same as this for a very long way--more than a week's journey,\r\nand they seemed hardly to have any conception of an elevated forest-clad\r\ncountry, so that I began to think it would be useless going on, as the\r\ntime at my disposal was too short to make it worth my while to spend\r\nmuch more of it in moving about. At length, however, I found a man who\r\nknew the country, and was more intelligent; and he at once told me that\r\nif I wanted forest I must go to the district of Rembang, which I found\r\non inquiry was about twenty-five or thirty miles off.\r\n\r\nThe road is divided into regular stages of ten or twelve miles each,\r\nand, without sending on in advance to have coolies ready, only this\r\ndistance can be travelled in a day. At each station there are houses for\r\nthe accommodation of passengers, with cooking-house and stables, and six\r\nor eight men always on guard. There is an established system for coolies\r\nat fixed rates, the inhabitants of the surrounding villages all taking\r\ntheir turn to be subject to coolie service, as well as that of guards at\r\nthe station for five days at a time. This arrangement makes travelling\r\nvery easy, and was a great convenience for me. I had a pleasant walk of\r\nten or twelve miles in the morning, and the rest of the day could stroll\r\nabout and explore the village and neighbourhood, having a house ready\r\nto occupy without any formalities whatever. In three days I reached\r\nMoera-dua, the first village in Rembang, and finding the country dry and\r\nundulating, with a good sprinkling of forest, I determined to remain a\r\nshort time and try the neighbourhood. Just opposite the station was a\r\nsmall but deep river, and a good bathing-place; and beyond the village\r\nwas a fine patch of forest, through which the road passed, overshadowed\r\nby magnificent trees, which partly tempted me to stay; but after a\r\nfortnight I could find no good place for insects, and very few birds\r\ndifferent from the common species of Malacca. I therefore moved on\r\nanother stage to Lobo Raman, where the guard-house is situated quite by\r\nitself in the forest, nearly a mile from each of three villages. This\r\nwas very agreeable to me, as I could move about without having every\r\nmotion watched by crowds of men, women and children, and I had also\r\na much greater variety of walks to each of the villages and the\r\nplantations around them.\r\n\r\nThe villages of the Sumatran Malays are somewhat peculiar and very\r\npicturesque. A space of some acres is surrounded with a high fence, and\r\nover this area the houses are thickly strewn without the least attempt\r\nat regularity. Tall cocoa-nut trees grow abundantly between them, and\r\nthe ground is bare and smooth with the trampling of many feet. The\r\nhouses are raised about six feet on posts, the best being entirely\r\nbuilt of planks, others of bamboo. The former are always more or less\r\nornamented with carving and have high-pitched roofs and overhanging\r\neaves. The gable ends and all the chief posts and beams are sometimes\r\ncovered with exceedingly tasteful carved work, and this is still more\r\nthe case in the district of Menangkabo, further west. The floor is made\r\nof split bamboo, and is rather shaky, and there is no sign of anything\r\nwe should call furniture. There are no benches or chairs or stools, but\r\nmerely the level floor covered with mats, on which the inmates sit or\r\nlie. The aspect of the village itself is very neat, the ground being\r\noften swept before the chief houses; but very bad odours abound, owing\r\nto there being under every house a stinking mud-hole, formed by all\r\nwaste liquids and refuse matter, poured down through the floor above. In\r\nmost other things Malays are tolerably clean--in some scrupulously so;\r\nand this peculiar and nasty custom, which is almost universal, arises,\r\nI have little doubt, from their having been originally a maritime and\r\nwater-loving people, who built their houses on posts in the water, and\r\nonly migrated gradually inland, first up the rivers and streams, and\r\nthen into the dry interior. Habits which were at once so convenient and\r\nso cleanly, and which had been so long practised as to become a portion\r\nof the domestic life of the nation, were of course continued when the\r\nfirst settlers built their houses inland; and without a regular system\r\nof drainage, the arrangement of the villages is such that any other\r\nsystem would be very inconvenient.\r\n\r\nIn all these Sumatran villages I found considerable difficulty in\r\ngetting anything to eat. It was not the season for vegetables, and when,\r\nafter much trouble, I managed to procure some yams of a curious variety,\r\nI found them hard and scarcely eatable. Fowls were very scarce; and\r\nfruit was reduced to one of the poorest kinds of banana. The natives\r\n(during the wet season at least) live exclusively on rice, as the poorer\r\nIrish do on potatoes. A pot of rice cooked very dry and eaten with salt\r\nand red peppers, twice a day, forms their entire food during a large\r\npart of the year. This is no sign of poverty, but is simply custom; for\r\ntheir wives and children are loaded with silver armlets from wrist to\r\nelbow, and carry dozens of silver coins strung round their necks or\r\nsuspended from their ears.\r\n\r\nAs I had moved away from Palembang, I had found the Malay spoken by\r\nthe common people less and less pure, until at length it became quite\r\nunintelligible, although the continual recurrence of many well-known\r\nwords assured me it was a form of Malay, and enabled me to guess at the\r\nmain subject of conversation. This district had a very bad reputation\r\na few years ago, and travellers were frequently robbed and murdered.\r\nFights between village and village were also of frequent occurrence, and\r\nmany lives were lost, owing to disputes about boundaries or intrigues\r\nwith women. Now, however, since the country has been divided into\r\ndistricts under \"Controlleurs,\" who visit every village in turn to hear\r\ncomplaints and settle disputes, such things are heard of no more. This\r\nis one of the numerous examples I have met with of the good effects of\r\nthe Dutch Government. It exercises a strict surveillance over its most\r\ndistant possessions, establishes a form of government well adapted to\r\nthe character of the people, reforms abuses, punishes crimes, and makes\r\nitself everywhere respected by the native population.\r\n\r\nLobo Raman is a central point of the east end of Sumatra, being about a\r\nhundred and twenty miles from the sea to the east, north, and west. The\r\nsurface is undulating, with no mountains or even hills, and there is\r\nno rock, the soil being generally a red friable clay. Numbers of small\r\nstreams and rivers intersect the country, and it is pretty equally\r\ndivided between open clearings and patches of forest, both virgin and\r\nsecond growth, with abundance of fruit trees; and there is no lack of\r\npaths to get about in any direction. Altogether it is the very country\r\nthat would promise most for a naturalist, and I feel sure that at a more\r\nfavourable time of year it would prove exceedingly rich; but it was\r\nnow the rainy season, when, in the very best of localities, insects are\r\nalways scarce, and there being no fruit on the trees, there was also a\r\nscarcity of birds. During a month's collecting, I added only three or\r\nfour new species to my list of birds, although I obtained very fine\r\nspecimens of many which were rare and interesting. In butterflies I was\r\nrather more successful, obtaining several fine species quite new to me,\r\nand a considerable number of very rare and beautiful insects. I will\r\ngive here some account of two species of butterflies, which, though\r\nvery common in collections, present us with peculiarities of the highest\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe first is the handsome Papilio memnon, a splendid butterfly of a deep\r\nblack colour, dotted over with lines and groups of scales of a clear\r\nashy blue. Its wings are five inches in expanse, and the hind wings\r\nare rounded, with scalloped edges. This applies to the males; but\r\nthe females are very different, and vary so much that they were once\r\nsupposed to form several distinct species. They may be divided into two\r\ngroups--those which resemble the male in shape, and, those which differ\r\nentirely from him in the outline of the wings. The first vary much in\r\ncolour, being often nearly white with dusky yellow and red markings, but\r\nsuch differences often occur in butterflies. The second group are much\r\nmore extraordinary, and would never be supposed to be the same insect,\r\nsince the hind wings are lengthened out into large spoon-shaped tails,\r\nno rudiment of which is ever to be perceived in the males or in the\r\nordinary form of females. These tailed females are never of the dark\r\nand blue-glossed tints which prevail in the male and often occur in the\r\nfemales of the same form, but are invariably ornamented with stripes and\r\npatches of white or buff, occupying the larger part of the surface of\r\nthe hind wings. This peculiarity of colouring led me to discover that\r\nthis extraordinary female closely resembles (when flying) another\r\nbutterfly of the same genus but of a different group (Papilio coön), and\r\nthat we have here a case of mimicry similar to those so well illustrated\r\nand explained by Mr. Bates.[ Trans. Linn. Soc. vol. xviii. p. 495;\r\n\"Naturalist on the Amazons,\" vol. i. p. 290.]\r\n\r\nThat the resemblance is not accidental is sufficiently proved by the\r\nfact, that in the North of India, where Papilio coön is replaced by an\r\nallied form, (Papilio Doubledayi) having red spots in place of yellow,\r\na closely-allied species or variety of Papilio memnon (P. androgeus)\r\nhas the tailed female also red spotted. The use and reason of this\r\nresemblance appears to be that the butterflies imitated belong to a\r\nsection of the genus Papilio which from some cause or other are not\r\nattacked by birds, and by so closely resembling these in form and colour\r\nthe female of Memnon and its ally, also escape persecution. Two other\r\nspecies of this same section (Papilio antiphus and Papilio polyphontes)\r\nare so closely imitated by two female forms of Papilio theseus (which\r\ncomes in the same section with Memnon), that they completely deceived\r\nthe Dutch entomologist De Haan, and he accordingly classed them as the\r\nsame species!\r\n\r\nBut the most curious fact connected with these distinct forms is that\r\nthey are both the offspring of either form. A single brood of larva\r\nwere bred in Java by a Dutch entomologist, and produced males as well as\r\ntailed and tailless females, and there is every reason to believe that\r\nthis is always the case, and that forms intermediate in character\r\nnever occur. To illustrate these phenomena, let us suppose a roaming\r\nEnglishman in some remote island to have two wives--one a black-haired,\r\nred-skinned Indian, the other a woolly-headed, sooty-skinned negress;\r\nand that instead of the children being mulattoes of brown or dusky\r\ntints, mingling the characteristics of each parent in varying degrees,\r\nall the boys should be as fair-skinned and blue-eyed as their father,\r\nwhile the girls should altogether resemble their mothers. This would be\r\nthought strange enough, but the case of these butterflies is yet more\r\nextraordinary, for each mother is capable not only of producing male\r\noffspring like the father, and female like herself, but also other\r\nfemales like her fellow wife, and altogether differing from herself!\r\n\r\nThe other species to which I have to direct attention is the Kallima\r\nparalekta, a butterfly of the same family group as our Purple Emperor,\r\nand of about the same size or larger. Its upper surface is of a rich\r\npurple, variously tinged with ash colour, and across the forewings\r\nthere is a broad bar of deep orange, so that when on the wing it is very\r\nconspicuous. This species was not uncommon in dry woods and thickets,\r\nand I often endeavoured to capture it without success, for after flying\r\na short distance it would enter a bush among dry or dead leaves, and\r\nhowever carefully I crept up to the spot I could never discover it until\r\nit would suddenly start out again and then disappear in a similar place.\r\nIf at length I was fortunate enough to see the exact spot where the\r\nbutterfly settled, and though I lost sight of it for some time, I would\r\ndiscover that it was close before my eyes, but that in its position of\r\nrepose it so closely resembled a dead leaf attached to a twig as almost\r\ncertainly to deceive the eye even when gazing full upon it. I captured\r\nseveral specimens on the wing, and was able fully to understand the way\r\nin which this wonderful resemblance is produced.\r\n\r\nThe end of the upper wings terminates in a fine point, just as the\r\nleaves of many tropical shrubs and trees are pointed, while the lower\r\nwings are somewhat more obtuse, and are lengthened out into a short\r\nthick tail. Between these two points there runs a dark curved line\r\nexactly representing the midrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on each\r\nside a few oblique marks which well imitate the lateral veins. These\r\nmarks are more clearly seen on the outer portion of the base of the\r\nwings, and on the innerside towards the middle and apex, and they are\r\nproduced by striae and markings which are very common in allied species,\r\nbut which are here modified and strengthened so as to imitate more\r\nexactly the venation of a leaf. The tint of the undersurface varies\r\nmuch, but it is always some ashy brown or reddish colour, which matches\r\nwith those of dead leaves. The habit of the species is always to rest on\r\na twig and among dead or dry leaves, and in this position with the\r\nwings closely pressed together, their outline is exactly that of a\r\nmoderately-sized leaf, slightly curved or shrivelled. The tail of the\r\nhind wings forms a perfect stalk, and touches the stick while the insect\r\nis supported by the middle pair of legs, which are not noticed among the\r\ntwigs and fibres that surround it. The head and antennae are drawn back\r\nbetween the wings so as to be quite concealed, and there is a little\r\nnotch hollowed out at the very base of the wings, which allows the\r\nhead to be retracted sufficiently. All these varied details combine to\r\nproduce a disguise that is so complete and marvellous as to astonish\r\neveryone who observes it; and the habits of the insects are such as to\r\nutilize all these peculiarities, and render them available in such a\r\nmanner as to remove all doubt of the purpose of this singular case of\r\nmimicry, which is undoubtedly a protection to the insect.\r\n\r\nIts strong and swift flight is sufficient to save it from its enemies\r\nwhen on the wing, but if it were equally conspicuous when at rest\r\nit could not long escape extinction, owing to the attacks of the\r\ninsectivorous birds and reptiles that abound in the tropical forests. A\r\nvery closely allied species, Kallima inachis, inhabits India, where\r\nit is very common, and specimens are sent in every collection from the\r\nHimalayas. On examining a number of these, it will be seen that no two\r\nare alike, but all the variations correspond to those of dead leaves.\r\nEvery tint of yellow, ash, brown, and red is found here, and in many\r\nspecimens there occur patches and spots formed of small black dots, so\r\nclosely resembling the way in which minute fungi grow on leaves that it\r\nis almost impossible at first not to believe that fungi have grown on\r\nthe butterflies themselves!\r\n\r\nIf such an extraordinary adaptation as this stood alone, it would\r\nbe very difficult to offer any explanation of it; but although it is\r\nperhaps the most perfect case of protective imitation known, there\r\nare hundreds of similar resemblances in nature, and from these it is\r\npossible to deduce a general theory of the manner in which they have\r\nbeen slowly brought about. The principle of variation and that of\r\n\"natural selection,\" or survival of the fittest, as elaborated by Mr.\r\nDarwin in his celebrated \"Origin of Species,\" offers the foundation\r\nfor such a theory; and I have myself endeavoured to apply it to all the\r\nchief cases of imitation in an article published in the \"Westminster\r\nReview\" for 1867, entitled, \"Mimicry, and other Protective Resemblances\r\nAmong Animals,\" to which any reader is referred who wishes to know more\r\nabout this subject.\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra, monkeys are very abundant, and at Lobo Kaman they used to\r\nfrequent the trees which overhang the guard-house, and give me a fine\r\nopportunity of observing their gambols. Two species of Semnopithecus\r\nwere most plentiful--monkeys of a slender form, with very long\r\ntails. Not being much shot at they are rather bold, and remain quite\r\nunconcerned when natives alone are present; but when I came out to look\r\nat them, they would stare for a minute or two and then make off. They\r\ntake tremendous leaps from the branches of one tree to those of another\r\na little lower, and it is very amusing when one strong leader takes a\r\nbold jump, to see the others following with more or less trepidation;\r\nand it often happens that one or two of the last seem quite unable to\r\nmake up their minds to leap until the rest are disappearing, when, as\r\nif in desperation at being left alone, they throw themselves frantically\r\ninto the air, and often go crashing through the slender branches and\r\nfall to the ground.\r\n\r\nA very curious ape, the Siamang, was also rather abundant, but it is\r\nmuch less bold than the monkeys, keeping to the virgin forests and\r\navoiding villages. This species is allied to the little long-armed apes\r\nof the genus Hylobates, but is considerably larger, and differs from\r\nthem by having the two first fingers of the feet united together, nearly\r\nto the end as does its Latin name, Siamanga syndactyla. It moves much\r\nmore slowly than the active Hylobates, keeping lower down in trees, and\r\nnot indulging in such tremendous leaps; but it is still very active,\r\nand by means of its immense long arms, five feet six inches across in an\r\nadult about three feet high, can swing itself along among the trees at\r\na great rate. I purchased a small one, which had been caught by the\r\nnatives and tied up so tightly as to hurt it. It was rather savage at\r\nfirst, and tried to bite; but when we had released it and given it two\r\npoles under the verandah to hang upon, securing it by a short cord,\r\nrunning along the pole with a ring so that it could move easily, it\r\nbecame more contented, and would swing itself about with great rapidity.\r\nIt ate almost any kind of fruit and rice, and I was in hopes to have\r\nbrought it to England, but it died just before I started. It took\r\na dislike to me at first, which I tried to get over by feeding it\r\nconstantly myself. One day, however, it bit me so sharply while giving\r\nit food, that I lost patience and gave it rather a severe beating, which\r\nI regretted afterwards, as from that time it disliked me more than ever.\r\nIt would allow my Malay boys to play with it, and for hours together\r\nwould swing by its arms from pole to pole and on to the rafters of the\r\nverandah, with so much ease and rapidity, that it was a constant source\r\nof amusement to us. When I returned to Singapore it attracted great\r\nattention, as no one had seen a Siamang alive before, although it is not\r\nuncommon in some parts of the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nAs the Orangutan is known to inhabit Sumatra, and was in fact first\r\ndiscovered there, I made many inquiries about it; but none of the\r\nnatives had ever heard of such an animal, nor could I find any of the\r\nDutch officials who knew anything about it. We may conclude, therefore,\r\nthat it does not inhabit the great forest plains in the east of Sumatra\r\nwhere one would naturally expect to find it, but is probably confined\r\nto a limited region in the northwest part of the island entirely in\r\nthe hands of native rulers. The other great Mammalia of Sumatra, the\r\nelephant and the rhinoceros, are more widely distributed; but the former\r\nis much more scarce than it was a few years ago, and seems to retire\r\nrapidly before the spread of cultivation. Lobo Kaman tusks and bones\r\nare occasionally found about in the forest, but the living animal is now\r\nnever seen. The rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sumatranus) still abounds, and I\r\ncontinually saw its tracks and its dung, and once disturbed one feeding,\r\nwhich went crashing away through the jungle, only permitting me a\r\nmomentary glimpse of it through the dense underwood. I obtained a\r\ntolerably perfect cranium, and a number of teeth, which were picked up\r\nby the natives.\r\n\r\nAnother curious animal, which I had met with in Singapore and in Borneo,\r\nbut which was more abundant here, is the Galeopithecus, or flying lemur.\r\nThis creature has a broad membrane extending all around its body to the\r\nextremities of the toes, and to the point of the rather long tail. This\r\nenables it to pass obliquely through the air from one tree to another.\r\nIt is sluggish in its motions, at least by day, going up a tree by short\r\nruns of a few feet, and then stopping a moment as if the action was\r\ndifficult. It rests during the day clinging to the trunks of trees,\r\nwhere its olive or brown fur, mottled with irregular whitish spots and\r\nblotches, resembles closely the colour of mottled bark, and no doubt\r\nhelps to protect it. Once, in a bright twilight, I saw one of these\r\nanimals run up a trunk in a rather open place, and then glide obliquely\r\nthrough the air to another tree, on which it alighted near its base, and\r\nimmediately began to ascend. I paced the distance from the one tree to\r\nthe other, and found it to be seventy yards; and the amount of descent\r\nI estimated at not more than thirty-five or forty feet, or less than\r\none in five. This I think proves that the animal must have some power of\r\nguiding itself through the air, otherwise in so long a distance it would\r\nhave little chance of alighting exactly upon the trunk. Like the\r\nCuscus of the Moluccas, the Galeopithecus feeds chiefly on leaves, and\r\npossesses a very voluminous stomach and long convoluted intestines. The\r\nbrain is very small, and the animal possesses such remarkable tenacity\r\nof life, that it is exceedingly difficult to kill it by any ordinary\r\nmeans. The tail is prehensile; and is probably made use of as an\r\nadditional support while feeding. It is said to have only a single young\r\none at a time, and my own observation confirms this statement, for I\r\nonce shot a female with a very small blind and naked little creature\r\nclinging closely to its breast, which was quite bare and much wrinkled,\r\nreminding me of the young of Marsupials, to which it seemed to form a\r\ntransition. On the back, and extending over the limbs and membrane, the\r\nfur of these animals is short, but exquisitely soft, resembling in its\r\ntexture that of the Chinchilla.\r\n\r\nI returned to Palembang by water, and while staying a day at a village\r\nwhile a boat was being made watertight, I had the good fortune to obtain\r\na male, female, and young bird of one of the large hornbills. I had\r\nsent my hunters to shoot, and while I was at breakfast they returned,\r\nbringing me a fine large male of the Buceros bicornis, which one of them\r\nassured me he had shot while feeding the female, which was shut up in a\r\nhole in a tree. I had often read of this curious habit, and immediately\r\nreturned to the place, accompanied by several of the natives. After\r\ncrossing a stream and a bog, we found a large tree leaning over some\r\nwater, and on its lower side, at a height of about twenty feet, appeared\r\na small hole, and what looked like a quantity of mud, which I was\r\nassured had been used in stopping up the large hole. After a while we\r\nheard the harsh cry of a bird inside, and could see the white extremity\r\nof its beak put out. I offered a rupee to anyone who would go up and get\r\nthe bird out, with the egg or young one; but they all declared it was\r\ntoo difficult, and they were afraid to try. I therefore very reluctantly\r\ncame away. About an hour afterwards, much to my surprise, a tremendous\r\nloud, hoarse screaming was heard, and the bird was brought me, together\r\nwith a young one which had been found in the hole. This was a most\r\ncurious object, as large as a pigeon, but without a particle of plumage\r\non any part of it. It was exceedingly plump and soft, and with a\r\nsemi-transparent skin, so that it looked more like a bag of jelly, with\r\nhead and feet stuck on, than like a real bird.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary habit of the male, in plastering up the female with\r\nher egg, and feeding her during the whole time of incubation, and until\r\nthe young one is fledged, is common to several of the large hornbills,\r\nand is one of those strange facts in natural history which are \"stranger\r\nthan fiction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. NATURAL HISTORY OF THE INDO-MALAY ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIN the first CHAPTER of this work I have stated generally the reasons\r\nwhich lead us to conclude that the large islands in the western portion\r\nof the Archipelago--Java, Sumatra, and Borneo--as well as the Malay\r\npeninsula and the Philippine islands, have been recently separated from\r\nthe continent of Asia. I now propose to give a sketch of the Natural\r\nHistory of these, which I term the Indo-Malay islands, and to show how\r\nfar it supports this view, and how much information it is able to give\r\nus of the antiquity and origin of the separate islands.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Archipelago is at present so imperfectly known, and I\r\nhave myself paid so little attention to it, that I cannot draw from it\r\nmany facts of importance. The Malayan type of vegetation is however a\r\nvery important one; and Dr. Hooker informs us, in his \"Flora Indica,\"\r\nthat it spreads over all the moister and more equable parts of India,\r\nand that many plants found in Ceylon, the Himalayas, the Nilghiri,\r\nand Khasia mountains are identical with those of Java and the Malay\r\npeninsula. Among the more characteristic forms of this flora are the\r\nrattans--climbing palms of the genus Calamus, and a great variety of\r\ntall, as well as stemless palms. Orchids, Araceae, Zingiberaceae\r\nand ferns, are especially abundant, and the genus Grammatophyllum--a\r\ngigantic epiphytal orchid, whose clusters of leaves and flower-stems are\r\nten or twelve feet long--is peculiar to it. Here, too, is the domain of\r\nthe wonderful pitcher plants (Nepenthaceae), which are only represented\r\nelsewhere by solitary species in Ceylon, Madagascar, the Seychelles,\r\nCelebes, and the Moluccas. Those celebrated fruits, the Mangosteen and\r\nthe Durian, are natives of this region, and will hardly grow out of the\r\nArchipelago. The mountain plants of Java have already been alluded to as\r\nshowing a former connexion with the continent of Asia; and a still\r\nmore extraordinary and more ancient connection with Australia has been\r\nindicated by Mr. Low's collections from the summit of Kini-balou, the\r\nloftiest mountain in Borneo.\r\n\r\nPlants have much greater facilities for passing across arms of the sea\r\nthan animals. The lighter seeds are easily carried by the winds, and\r\nmany of them are specially adapted to be so carried. Others can float a\r\nlong time unhurt in the water, and are drifted by winds and currents\r\nto distant shores. Pigeons, and other fruit-eating birds, are also the\r\nmeans of distributing plants, since the seeds readily germinate after\r\npassing through their bodies. It thus happens that plants which grow\r\non shores and lowlands have a wide distribution, and it requires an\r\nextensive knowledge of the species of each island to determine the\r\nrelations of their floras with any approach to accuracy. At present we\r\nhave no such complete knowledge of the botany of the several islands\r\nof the Archipelago; and it is only by such striking phenomena as the\r\noccurrence of northern and even European genera on the summits of the\r\nJavanese mountains that we can prove the former connection of that\r\nisland with the Asiatic continent. With land animals, however, the case\r\nis very different. Their means of passing a wide expanse of sea are far\r\nmore restricted. Their distribution has been more accurately studied,\r\nand we possess a much more complete knowledge of such groups as mammals\r\nand birds in most of the islands, than we do of the plants. It is\r\nthese two classes which will supply us with most of our facts as to the\r\ngeographical distribution of organized beings in this region.\r\n\r\nThe number of Mammalia known to inhabit the Indo-Malay region is very\r\nconsiderable, exceeding 170 species. With the exception of the bats,\r\nnone of these have any regular means of passing arms of the sea\r\nmany miles in extent, and a consideration of their distribution must\r\ntherefore greatly assist us in determining whether these islands have\r\never been connected with each other or with the continent since the\r\nepoch of existing species.\r\n\r\nThe Quadrumana or monkey tribe form one of the most characteristic\r\nfeatures of this region. Twenty-four distinct species are known to\r\ninhabit it, and these are distributed with tolerable uniformity over the\r\nislands, nine being found in Java, ten in the Malay peninsula, eleven in\r\nSumatra, and thirteen in Borneo. The great man-like Orangutans are found\r\nonly in Sumatra and Borneo; the curious Siamang (next to them in size)\r\nin Sumatra and Malacca; the long-nosed monkey only in Borneo; while\r\nevery island has representatives of the Gibbons or long-armed apes,\r\nand of monkeys. The lemur-like animals, Nycticebus, Tarsius, and\r\nGaleopithecus, are found on all the islands.\r\n\r\nSeven species found on the Malay peninsula extend also into Sumatra,\r\nfour into Borneo, and three into Java; while two range into Siam and\r\nBurma, and one into North India. With the exception of the Orangutan,\r\nthe Siamang, the Tarsius spectrum, and the Galeopithecus, all the\r\nMalayan genera of Quadrumana are represented in India by closely allied\r\nspecies, although, owing to the limited range of most of these animals,\r\nso few are absolutely identical.\r\n\r\nOf Carnivora, thirty-three species are known from the Indo-Malay region,\r\nof which about eight are found also in Burma and India. Among these\r\nare the tiger, leopard, a tiger-cat, civet, and otter; while out of the\r\ntwenty genera of Malayan Carnivora, thirteen are represented in India by\r\nmore or less closely allied species. As an example, the Malayan bear\r\nis represented in North India by the Tibetan bear, both of which may be\r\nseen alive at the Zoological Society's Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe hoofed animals are twenty-two in number, of which about seven extend\r\ninto Burmah and India. All the deer are of peculiar species, except two,\r\nwhich range from Malacca into India. Of the cattle, one Indian species\r\nreaches Malacca, while the Bos sondiacus of Java and Borneo is also\r\nfound in Siam and Burma. A goat-like animal is found in Sumatra which\r\nhas its representative in India; while the two-horned rhinoceros of\r\nSumatra and the single-horned species of Java, long supposed to be\r\npeculiar to these islands, are now both ascertained to exist in Burma,\r\nPegu, and Moulmein. The elephant of Sumatra, Borneo, and Malacca is now\r\nconsidered to be identical with that of Ceylon and India.\r\n\r\nIn all other groups of Mammalia the same general phenomena recur. A\r\nfew species are identical with those of India. A much larger number are\r\nclosely allied or representative forms, while there are always a small\r\nnumber of peculiar genera, consisting of animals unlike those found in\r\nany other part of the world. There are about fifty bats, of which less\r\nthan one-fourth are Indian species; thirty-four Rodents (squirrels,\r\nrats, &c.), of which six or eight only are Indian; and ten Insectivora,\r\nwith one exception peculiar to the Malay region. The squirrels are\r\nvery abundant and characteristic, only two species out of twenty-five\r\nextending into Siam and Burma. The Tupaias are curious insect-eaters,\r\nwhich closely resemble squirrels, and are almost confined to the Malay\r\nislands, as are the small feather-tailed Ptilocerus lowii of Borneo, and\r\nthe curious long-snouted and naked-tailed Gymnurus rafllesii.\r\n\r\nAs the Malay peninsula is a part of the continent of Asia, the question\r\nof the former union of the islands to the mainland will be best\r\nelucidated by studying the species which are found in the former\r\ndistrict, and also in some of the islands. Now, if we entirely leave\r\nout of consideration the bats, which have the power of flight, there are\r\nstill forty-eight species of mammals common to the Malay peninsula\r\nand the three large islands. Among these are seven Quadrumana (apes,\r\nmonkeys, and lemurs), animals who pass their whole existence in forests,\r\nwho never swim, and who would be quite unable to traverse a single\r\nmile of sea; nineteen Carnivora, some of which no doubt might cross by\r\nswimming, but we cannot suppose so large a number to have passed in this\r\nway across a strait which, except at one point, is from thirty to fifty\r\nmiles wide; and five hoofed animals, including the Tapir, two species\r\nof rhinoceros, and an elephant. Besides these there are thirteen Rodents\r\nand four Insectivora, including a shrew-mouse and six squirrels, whose\r\nunaided passage over twenty miles of sea is even more inconceivable than\r\nthat of the larger animals.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the cases of the same species inhabiting two of the\r\nmore widely separated islands, the difficulty is much increased. Borneo\r\nis distant nearly 150 miles from Biliton, which is about fifty miles\r\nfrom Banca, and this fifteen from Sumatra, yet there are no less than\r\nthirty-six species of mammals common to Borneo and Sumatra. Java\r\nagain is more than 250 miles from Borneo, yet these two islands have\r\ntwenty-two species in common, including monkeys, lemurs, wild oxen,\r\nsquirrels and shrews. These facts seem to render it absolutely certain\r\nthat there has been at some former period a connection between all these\r\nislands and the mainland, and the fact that most of the animals common\r\nto two or more of then, show little or no variation, but are often\r\nabsolutely identical, indicates that the separation must have been\r\nrecent in a geological sense; that is, not earlier than the Newer\r\nPliocene epoch, at which time land animals began to assimilate closely\r\nwith those now existing.\r\n\r\nEven the bats furnish an additional argument, if one were needed, to\r\nshow that the islands could not have been peopled from each other and\r\nfrom the continent without some former connection. For if such had\r\nbeen the mode of stocking them with animals, it is quite certain that\r\ncreatures which can fly long distances would be the first to spread\r\nfrom island to island, and thus produce an almost perfect uniformity of\r\nspecies over the whole region. But no such uniformity exists, and the\r\nbats of each island are almost, if not quite, as distinct as the other\r\nmammals. For example, sixteen species are known in Borneo, and of these\r\nten are found in Java and five in Sumatra, a proportion about the same\r\nas that of the Rodents, which have no direct means of migration. We\r\nlearn from this fact, that the seas which separate the islands from each\r\nother are wide enough to prevent the passage even of flying animals,\r\nand that we must look to the same causes as having led to the present\r\ndistribution of both groups. The only sufficient cause we can imagine is\r\nthe former connection of all the islands with the continent, and such\r\na change is in perfect harmony with what we know of the earth's past\r\nhistory, and is rendered probable by the remarkable fact that a rise of\r\nonly three hundred feet would convert the wide seas that separate them\r\ninto an immense winding valley or plain about three hundred miles wide\r\nand twelve hundred long. It may, perhaps, be thought that birds which\r\npossess the power of flight in so pre-eminent a degree, would not be\r\nlimited in their range by arms of the sea, and would thus afford few\r\nindications of the former union or separation of the islands they\r\ninhabit. This, however, is not the case. A very large number of birds\r\nappear to be as strictly limited by watery barriers as are quadrupeds;\r\nand as they have been so much more attentively collected, we have more\r\ncomplete materials to work upon, and are able to deduce from them still\r\nmore definite and satisfactory results. Some groups, however, such\r\nas the aquatic birds, the waders, and the birds of prey, are great\r\nwanderers; other groups are little known except to ornithologists.\r\nI shall therefore refer chiefly to a few of the best known and most\r\nremarkable families of birds as a sample of the conclusions furnished by\r\nthe entire class.\r\n\r\nThe birds of the Indo-Malay region have a close resemblance to those\r\nof India; for though a very large proportion of the species are quite\r\ndistinct, there are only about fifteen peculiar genera, and not a single\r\nfamily group confined to the former district. If, however, we compare\r\nthe islands with the Burmese, Siamese, and Malayan countries, we shall\r\nfind still less difference, and shall be convinced that all are closely\r\nunited by the bond of a former union. In such well-known families as\r\nthe woodpeckers, parrots, trogons, barbets, kingfishers, pigeons, and\r\npheasants, we find some identical species spreading over all India, and\r\nas far as Java and Borneo, while a very large proportion are common to\r\nSumatra and the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe force of these facts can only be appreciated when we come to treat\r\nthe islands of the Austro-Malay region, and show how similar barriers\r\nhave entirely prevented the passage of birds from one island to another,\r\nso that out of at least three hundred and fifty land birds inhabiting\r\nJava and Borneo, not more than ten have passed eastward into Celebes.\r\nYet the Straits of Macassar are not nearly so wide as the Java sea, and\r\nat least a hundred species are common to Borneo and Java.\r\n\r\nI will now give two examples to show how a knowledge of the distribution\r\nof animals may reveal unsuspected facts in the past history of the\r\nearth. At the eastern extremity of Sumatra, and separated from it by\r\na strait about fifteen miles wide, is the small rocky island of Banca,\r\ncelebrated for its tin mines. One of the Dutch residents there sent some\r\ncollections of birds and animals to Leyden, and among them were found\r\nseveral species distinct from those of the adjacent coast of Sumatra.\r\nOne of these was a squirrel (Sciurus bangkanus), closely allied to three\r\nother species inhabiting respectively the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, and\r\nBorneo, but quite as distinct from them all as they are from each other.\r\nThere were also two new ground thrushes of the genus Pitta, closely\r\nallied to, but quite distinct from, two other species inhabiting both\r\nSumatra and Borneo, and which did not perceptibly differ in these\r\nlarge and widely separated islands. This is just as if the Isle of Man\r\npossessed a peculiar species of thrush and blackbird, distinct from the\r\nbirds which are common to England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese curious facts would indicate that Banca may have existed as a\r\ndistinct island even longer than Sumatra and Borneo, and there are some\r\ngeological and geographical facts which render this not so improbable as\r\nit would at first seem to be. Although on the map Banca appears so close\r\nto Sumatra, this does not arise from its having been recently separated\r\nfrom it; for the adjacent district of Palembang is new land, being a\r\ngreat alluvial swamp formed by torrents from the mountains a hundred\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\nBanca, on the other hand, agrees with Malacca, Singapore, and the\r\nintervening island of Lingen, in being formed of granite and laterite;\r\nand these have all most likely once formed an extension of the Malay\r\npeninsula. As the rivers of Borneo and Sumatra have been for ages\r\nfilling up the intervening sea, we may be sure that its depth has\r\nrecently been greater, and it is very probable that those large islands\r\nwere never directly connected with each other except through the Malay\r\npeninsula. At that period the same species of squirrel and Pitta\r\nmay have inhabited all these countries; but when the subterranean\r\ndisturbances occurred which led to the elevation of the volcanoes of\r\nSumatra, the small island of Banca may have been separated first, and\r\nits productions being thus isolated might be gradually modified before\r\nthe separation of the larger islands had been completed.\r\n\r\nAs the southern part of Sumatra extended eastward and formed the narrow\r\nstraits of Banca, many birds and insects and some Mammalia would\r\ncross from one to the other, and thus produce a general similarity of\r\nproductions, while a few of the older inhabitants remained, to reveal\r\nby their distinct forms, their different origin. Unless we suppose some\r\nsuch changes in physical geography to have occurred, the presence of\r\npeculiar species of birds and mammals in such an island as Banca is a\r\nhopeless puzzle; and I think I have shown that the changes required are\r\nby no means so improbable as a mere glance at the map would lead us to\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nFor our next example let us take the great islands of Sumatra and Java.\r\nThese approach so closely together, and the chain of volcanoes that runs\r\nthrough them gives such an air of unity to the two, that the idea of\r\ntheir having been recently dissevered is immediately suggested. The\r\nnatives of Java, however, go further than this; for they actually have a\r\ntradition of the catastrophe which broke them asunder, and fix its date\r\nat not much more than a thousand years ago. It becomes interesting,\r\ntherefore, to see what support is given to this view by the comparison\r\nof their animal productions.\r\n\r\nThe Mammalia have not been collected with sufficient completeness in\r\nboth islands to make a general comparison of much value, and so many\r\nspecies have been obtained only as live specimens in captivity, that\r\ntheir locality has often been erroneously given, the island in which\r\nthey were obtained being substituted for that from which they originally\r\ncame. Taking into consideration only those whose distribution is more\r\naccurately known, we learn that Sumatra is, in a zoological sense, more\r\nnearly related to Borneo than it is to Java. The great man-like apes,\r\nthe elephant, the tapir, and the Malay bear, are all common to the two\r\nformer countries, while they are absent from the latter. Of the three\r\nlong-tailed monkeys (Semnopithecus) inhabiting Sumatra, one extends into\r\nBorneo, but the two species of Java are both peculiar to it. So also\r\nthe great Malay deer (Rusa equina), and the small Tragulus kanchil, are\r\ncommon to Sumatra and Borneo, but do not extend into Java, where they\r\nare replaced by Tragulas javanicus. The tiger, it is true, is found in\r\nSumatra and Java, but not in Borneo. But as this animal is known to swim\r\nwell, it may have found its way across the Straits of Sunda, or it may\r\nhave inhabited Java before it was separated from the mainland, and from\r\nsome unknown cause have ceased to exist in Borneo.\r\n\r\nIn Ornithology there is a little uncertainty owing to the birds of\r\nJava and Sumatra being much better known than those of Borneo; but the\r\nancient separation of Java as an island is well exhibited by the large\r\nnumber of its species which are not found in any of the other islands.\r\nIt possesses no less than seven pigeons peculiar to itself, while\r\nSumatra has only one. Of its two parrots one extends into Borneo, but\r\nneither into Sumatra. Of the fifteen species of woodpeckers inhabiting\r\nSumatra only four reach Java, while eight of them are found in Borneo\r\nand twelve in the Malay peninsula. The two Trogons found in Java are\r\npeculiar to it, while of those inhabiting Sumatra at least two extend to\r\nMalacca and one to Borneo. There are a very large number of birds, such\r\nas the great Argus pheasant, the fire-backed and ocellated pheasants,\r\nthe crested partridge (Rollulus coronatus), the small Malacca parrot\r\n(Psittinus incertus), the great helmeted hornbill (Buceroturus\r\ngaleatus), the pheasant ground-cuckoo (Carpococcyx radiatus), the\r\nrose-crested bee-eater (Nyctiornis amicta), the great gaper (Corydon\r\nsumatranus), and the green-crested gaper (Calyptomena viridis), and\r\nmany others, which are common to Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are\r\nentirely absent from Java. On the other hand we have the peacock,\r\nthe green jungle cock, two blue ground thrushes (Arrenga cyanea\r\nand Myophonus flavirostris), the fine pink-headed dove (Ptilonopus\r\nporphyreus), three broad-tailed ground pigeons (Macropygia), and many\r\nother interesting birds, which are found nowhere in the Archipelago out\r\nof Java.\r\n\r\nInsects furnish us with similar facts wherever sufficient data are to be\r\nhad, but owing to the abundant collections that have been made in Java,\r\nan unfair preponderance may be given to that island. This does\r\nnot, however, seem to be the case with the true Papilionidae or\r\nswallow-tailed butterflies, whose large size and gorgeous colouring\r\nhas led to their being collected more frequently than other insects.\r\nTwenty-seven species are known from Java, twenty-nine from Borneo, and\r\nonly twenty-one from Sumatra. Four are entirely confined to Java, while\r\nonly two are peculiar to Borneo and one to Sumatra. The isolation of\r\nJava will, however, be best shown by grouping the islands in pairs, and\r\nindicating the number of species common to each pair. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Borneo .. . .. 29 species\r\n     Sumatra.. . .. 21  do.    20 species common to both islands.\r\n\r\n     Borneo .. . .. 29  do.\r\n     Java. .. . .. 27  do.    20    do.    do.\r\n\r\n     Sumatra.. . .. 21  do.\r\n     Java. .. . .. 27  do.    11    do.    do.\r\n\r\nMaking some allowance for our imperfect knowledge of the Sumatran\r\nspecies, we see that Java is more isolated from the two larger islands\r\nthan they are from each other, thus entirely confirming the results\r\ngiven by the distribution of birds and Mammalia, and rendering it\r\nalmost certain that the last-named island was the first to be completely\r\nseparated from the Asiatic continent, and that the native tradition\r\nof its having been recently separated from Sumatra is entirely without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nWe are now able to trace out with some probability the course of events.\r\nBeginning at the time when the whole of the Java sea, the Gulf of Siam,\r\nand the Straits of Malacca were dry land, forming with Borneo, Sumatra,\r\nand Java, a vast southern prolongation of the Asiatic continent, the\r\nfirst movement would be the sinking down of the Java sea, and the\r\nStraits of Sunda, consequent on the activity of the Javanese volcanoes\r\nalong the southern extremity of the land, and leading to the complete\r\nseparation of that island. As the volcanic belt of Java and Sumatra\r\nincreased in activity, more and more of the land was submerged, until\r\nfirst Borneo, and afterwards Sumatra, became entirely severed. Since\r\nthe epoch of the first disturbance, several distinct elevations and\r\ndepressions may have taken place, and the islands may have been more\r\nthan once joined with each other or with the main land, and again\r\nseparated. Successive waves of immigration may thus have modified their\r\nanimal productions, and led to those anomalies in distribution which\r\nare so difficult to account for by any single operation of elevation or\r\nsubmergence. The form of Borneo, consisting of radiating mountain chains\r\nwith intervening broad alluvial valleys, suggests the idea that it has\r\nonce been much more submerged than it is at present (when it would have\r\nsomewhat resembled Celebes or Gilolo in outline), and has been\r\nincreased to its present dimensions by the filling up of its gulfs with\r\nsedimentary matter, assisted by gradual elevation of the land. Sumatra\r\nhas also been evidently much increased in size by the formation of\r\nalluvial plains along its northeastern coasts.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity in the productions of Java that is very\r\npuzzling--the occurrence of several species or groups characteristic of\r\nthe Siamese countries or of India, but which do not occur in Borneo or\r\nSumatra. Among Mammals the Rhinoceros javanicus is the most striking\r\nexample, for a distinct species is found in Borneo and Sumatra, while\r\nthe Javanese species occurs in Burma and even in Bengal. Among birds,\r\nthe small ground-dove, Geopelia striata, and the curious bronze-coloured\r\nmagpie, Crypsirhina varians, are common to Java and Siam; while there\r\nare in Java species of Pteruthius, Arrenga, Myiophonus, Zoothera,\r\nSturnopastor, and Estrelda, the near allies of which are found in\r\nvarious parts of India, while nothing like them is known to inhabit\r\nBorneo or Sumatra.\r\n\r\nSuch a curious phenomenon as this can only be understood by supposing\r\nthat, subsequent to the separation of Java, Borneo became almost\r\nentirely submerged, and on its re-elevation was for a time connected\r\nwith the Malay peninsula and Sumatra, but not with Java or Siam. Any\r\ngeologist who knows how strata have been contorted and tilted up, and\r\nhow elevations and depressions must often have occurred alternately, not\r\nonce or twice only, but scores and even hundreds of times, will have no\r\ndifficulty in admitting that such changes as have been here indicated,\r\nare not in themselves improbable. The existence of extensive coal-beds\r\nin Borneo and Sumatra, of such recent origin that the leaves which\r\nabound in their shales are scarcely distinguishable from those of the\r\nforests which now cover the country, proves that such changes of level\r\nactually did take place; and it is a matter of much interest, both to\r\nthe geologist and to the philosophic naturalist, to be able to form some\r\nconception of the order of those changes, and to understand how they\r\nmay have resulted in the actual distribution of animal life in these\r\ncountries; a distribution which often presents phenomena so strange and\r\ncontradictory, that without taking such changes into consideration we\r\nare unable even to imagine how they could have been brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. BALI AND LOMBOCK.\r\n\r\n (JUNE, JULY, 1856.)\r\n\r\nTHE islands of Bali and Lombock, situated at the eastern end of Java,\r\nare particularly interesting. They are the only islands of the whole\r\nArchipelago in which the Hindu religion still maintains itself--and they\r\nform the extreme points of the two great zoological divisions of the\r\nEastern hemisphere; for although so similar in external appearance\r\nand in all physical features, they differ greatly in their natural\r\nproductions. It was after having spent two years in Borneo, Malacca and\r\nSingapore, that I made a somewhat involuntary visit to these islands on\r\nmy way to Macassar. Had I been able to obtain a passage direct to that\r\nplace from Singapore, I should probably never have gone near them, and\r\nshould have missed some of the most important discoveries of my whole\r\nexpedition the East.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 13th of June, 1856, after a twenty days' passage from\r\nSingapore in the \"Kembang Djepoon\" (Rose of Japan), a schooner belonging\r\nto a Chinese merchant, manned by a Javanese crew, and commanded by\r\nan English captain, that we cast anchor in the dangerous roadstead of\r\nBileling on the north side of the island of Bali. Going on shore with\r\nthe captain and the Chinese supercargo, I was at once introduced to a\r\nnovel and interesting scene. We went first to the house of the Chinese\r\nBandar, or chief merchant, where we found a number of natives, well\r\ndressed, and all conspicuously armed with krisses, displaying their\r\nlarge handles of ivory or gold, or beautifully grained and polished\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe Chinamen had given up their national costume and adopted the Malay\r\ndress, and could then hardly be distinguished from the natives of the\r\nisland--an indication of the close affinity of the Malayan and Mongolian\r\nraces. Under the thick shade of some mango-trees close by the house,\r\nseveral women-merchants were selling cotton goods; for here the women\r\ntrade and work for the benefit of their husbands, a custom which\r\nMahometan Malays never adopt. Fruit, tea, cakes, and sweetmeats were\r\nbrought to us; many questions were asked about our business and the\r\nstate of trade in Singapore, and we then took a walk to look at the\r\nvillage. It was a very dull and dreary place; a collection of narrow\r\nlanes bounded by high mud walls, enclosing bamboo houses, into some of\r\nwhich we entered and were very kindly received.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days that we remained here, I walked out into the\r\nsurrounding country to catch insects, shoot birds, and spy out the\r\nnakedness or fertility of the land. I was both astonished and delighted;\r\nfor as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so\r\nbeautiful and well cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly\r\nundulating plain extends from the seacoast about ten or twelve miles\r\ninland, where it is bounded by a wide range of wooded and cultivated\r\nhills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of cocoa-nut\r\npalms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every\r\ndirection; while between them extend luxuriant rice-grounds, watered by\r\nan elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best\r\ncultivated parts of Europe. The whole surface of the country is divided\r\ninto irregular patches, following the undulations of the ground, from\r\nmany acres to a few perches in extent, each of which is itself perfectly\r\nlevel, but stands a few inches or several feet above or below those\r\nadjacent to it. Every one of these patches can be flooded or drained at\r\nwill by means of a system of ditches and small channels, into which are\r\ndiverted the whole of the streams that descend from the mountains. Every\r\npatch now bore crops in various stages of growth, some almost ready\r\nfor cutting, and all in the most flourishing condition and of the most\r\nexquisite green tints.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the lanes and bridle roads were often edged with prickly\r\nCacti and a leafless Euphorbia, but the country being so highly\r\ncultivated there was not much room for indigenous vegetation, except\r\nupon the sea-beach. We saw plenty of the fine race of domestic cattle\r\ndescended from the Bos banteng of Java, driven by half naked boys, or\r\ntethered in pasture-grounds. They are large and handsome animals, of a\r\nlight brown colour, with white legs, and a conspicuous oval patch behind\r\nof the same colour. Wild cattle of the same race are said to be still\r\nfound in the mountains. In so well-cultivated a country it was not to\r\nbe expected that I could do much in natural history, and my ignorance\r\nof how important a locality this was for the elucidation of the\r\ngeographical distribution of animals, caused me to neglect obtaining\r\nsome specimens which I never met with again. One of these was a weaver\r\nbird with a bright yellow head, which built its bottle-shaped nests by\r\ndozens on some trees near the beach. It was the Ploceus hypoxantha, a\r\nnative of Java; and here, at the extreme limits of its range westerly,\r\nI shot and preserved specimens of a wagtail-thrush, an oriole, and some\r\nstarlings, all species found in Java, and some of them peculiar to that\r\nisland. I also obtained some beautiful butterflies, richly marked with\r\nblack and orange on a white ground, and which were the most abundant\r\ninsects in the country lanes. Among these was a new species, which I\r\nhave named Pieris tamar.\r\n\r\nLeaving Bileling, a pleasant sail of two days brought us to Ampanam in\r\nthe island of Lombock, where I proposed to remain till I could obtain\r\na passage to Macassar. We enjoyed superb views of the twin volcanoes\r\nof Bali and Lombock, each about eight thousand feet high, which form\r\nmagnificent objects at sunrise and sunset, when they rise out of the\r\nmists and clouds that surround their bases, glowing with the rich and\r\nchanging tints of these the most charming moments in a tropical day.\r\n\r\nThe bay or roadstead of Ampanam is extensive, and being at this season\r\nsheltered from the prevalent southeasterly winds, was as smooth as a\r\nlake. The beach of black volcanic sand is very steep, and there is at\r\nall times, a heavy surf upon it, which during spring-tides increases to\r\nsuch an extent that it is often impossible for boats to land, and many\r\nserious accidents have occurred. Where we lay anchored, about a quarter\r\nof a mile from the shore, not the slightest swell was perceptible, but\r\non approaching nearer undulations began, which rapidly increased, so as\r\nto form rollers which toppled over onto the beach at regular intervals\r\nwith a noise like thunder. Sometimes this surf increases suddenly during\r\nperfect calms to as great a force and fury as when a gale of wind is\r\nblowing, beating to pieces all boats that may not have been hauled\r\nsufficiently high upon the beach, and carrying away uncautious natives.\r\nThis violent surf is probably in some way dependent upon the swell of\r\nthe great southern ocean and the violent currents that flow through the\r\nStraits of Lombock. These are so uncertain that vessels preparing to\r\nanchor in the bay are sometimes suddenly swept away into the straits,\r\nand are not able to get back again for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nWhat seamen call the \"ripples\" are also very violent in the straits,\r\nthe sea appearing to boil and foam and dance like the rapids below\r\na cataract; vessels are swept about helplessly, and small ones are\r\noccasionally swamped in the finest weather and under the brightest\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nI felt considerably relieved when all my boxes and myself had passed in\r\nsafety through the devouring surf, which the natives look upon with some\r\npride, saying, that \"their sea is always hungry, and eats up everything\r\nit can catch.\" I was kindly received by Mr. Carter, an Englishman, who\r\nis one of the Bandars or licensed traders of the port, who offered me\r\nhospitality and every assistance during my stay. His house, storehouses,\r\nand offices were in a yard surrounded by a tall bamboo fence, and\r\nwere entirely constructed of bamboo with a thatch of grass, the only\r\navailable building materials. Even these were now very scarce, owing to\r\nthe great consumption in rebuilding the place since the great fire some\r\nmonths before, which in an hour or two had destroyed every building in\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nThe next day I went to see Mr. S., another merchant to whom I had\r\nbrought letters of introduction, and who lived about seven miles off.\r\nMr. Carter kindly lent me a horse, and I was accompanied by a young\r\nDutch gentleman residing at Ampanam, who offered to be my guide. We\r\nfirst passed through the town and suburbs along a straight road bordered\r\nby mud walls and a fine avenue of lofty trees; then through rice-fields,\r\nirrigated in the same manner as I had seen them at Bileling; and\r\nafterwards over sandy pastures near the sea, and occasionally along the\r\nbeach itself. Mr. S. received us kindly, and offered me a residence at\r\nhis house should I think the neighbourhood favourable for my pursuits.\r\nAfter an early breakfast we went out to explore, taking guns and\r\ninsect nets. We reached some low hills which seemed to offer the most\r\nfavourable ground, passing over swamps, sandy flats overgrown with\r\ncoarse sedges, and through pastures and cultivated grounds, finding\r\nhowever very little in the way of either birds or insects. On our way we\r\npassed one or two human skeletons, enclosed within a small bamboo\r\nfence, with the clothes, pillow, mat, and betel-box of the unfortunate\r\nindividual, who had been either murdered or executed. Returning to the\r\nhouse, we found a Balinese chief and his followers on a visit. Those of\r\nhigher rank sat on chairs, the others squatted on the floor. The chief\r\nvery coolly asked for beer and brandy, and helped himself and his\r\nfollowers, apparently more out of curiosity than anything else as\r\nregards the beer, for it seemed very distasteful to them, while they\r\ndrank the brandy in tumblers with much relish.\r\n\r\nReturning to Ampanam, I devoted myself for some days to shooting the\r\nbirds of the neighbourhood. The fine fig-trees of the avenues, where a\r\nmarket was held, were tenanted by superb orioles (Oriolus broderpii) of\r\na rich orange colour, and peculiar to this island and the adjacent ones\r\nof Sumbawa and Flores. All round the town were abundance of the curious\r\nTropidorhynchus timoriensis, allied to the Friar bird of Australia. They\r\nare here called \"Quaich-quaich,\" from their strange loud voice, which\r\nseems to repeat these words in various and not unmelodious intonations.\r\n\r\nEvery day boys were to be seen walking along the roads and by the hedges\r\nand ditches, catching dragonflies with birdlime. They carry a slender\r\nstick, with a few twigs at the end well annointed, so that the least\r\ntouch captures the insect, whose wings are pulled off before it is\r\nconsigned to a small basket. The dragon-flies are so abundant at the\r\ntime of the rice flowering that thousands are soon caught in this\r\nway. The bodies are fried in oil with onions and preserved shrimps,\r\nor sometimes alone, and are considered a great delicacy. In Borneo,\r\nCelebes, and many other islands, the larvae of bees and wasps are eaten,\r\neither alive as pulled out of the cells, or fried like the dragonflies.\r\nIn the Moluccas the grubs of the palm-beetles (Calandra) are regularly\r\nbrought to market in bamboos and sold for food; and many of the great\r\nhorned Lamellicorn beetles are slightly roasted on the embers and eaten\r\nwhenever met with. The superabundance of insect life is therefore turned\r\nto some account by these islanders.\r\n\r\nFinding that birds were not very numerous, and hearing much of Labuan\r\nTring at the southern extremity of the bay, where there was said to be\r\nmuch uncultivated country and plenty of birds as well as deer and wild\r\npigs, I determined to go there with my two servants, Ali, the Malay\r\nlad from Borneo, and Manuel, a Portuguese of Malacca accustomed to\r\nbird-skinning. I hired a native boat with outriggers to take us with\r\nour small quantity of luggage, and a day's rowing and tracking along the\r\nshore brought us to the place.\r\n\r\nI had a note of introduction to an Amboynese Malay, and obtained the use\r\nof part of his house to live and work in. His name was \"Inchi Daud\" (Mr.\r\nDavid), and he was very civil; but his accommodations were limited, and\r\nhe could only hire me part of his reception-room. This was the front\r\npart of a bamboo house (reached by a ladder of about six rounds very\r\nwide apart), and having a beautiful view over the bay. However, I soon\r\nmade what arrangements were possible, and then set to work. The country\r\naround was pretty and novel to me, consisting of abrupt volcanic hills\r\nenclosing flat valleys or open plains. The hills were covered with a\r\ndense scrubby bush of bamboos and prickly trees and shrubs, the plains\r\nwere adorned with hundreds of noble palm-trees, and in many places\r\nwith a luxuriant shrubby vegetation. Birds were plentiful and very\r\ninteresting, and I now saw for the first time many Australian forms that\r\nare quite absent from the islands westward. Small white cockatoos were\r\nabundant, and their loud screams, conspicuous white colour, and pretty\r\nyellow crests, rendered them a very important feature in the landscape.\r\nThis is the most westerly point on the globe where any of the family\r\nare to be found. Some small honeysuckers of the genus Ptilotis, and the\r\nstrange moundmaker (Megapodius gouldii), are also here first met with\r\non the traveller's journey eastward. The last mentioned bird requires a\r\nfuller notice.\r\n\r\nThe Megapodidae are a small family of birds found only in Australia and\r\nthe surrounding islands, but extending as far as the Philippines and\r\nNorthwest Borneo. They are allied to the gallinaceous birds, but differ\r\nfrom these and from all others in never sitting upon their eggs, which\r\nthey bury in sand, earth, or rubbish, and leave to be hatched by the\r\nheat of the sun or by fermentation. They are all characterised by very\r\nlarge feet and long curved claws, and most of the species of Megapodius\r\nrake and scratch together all kinds of rubbish, dead leaves, sticks,\r\nstones, earth, rotten wood, etc., until they form a large mound, often\r\nsix feet high and twelve feet across, in the middle of which they\r\nbury their eggs. The natives can tell by the condition of these mounds\r\nwhether they contain eggs or not; and they rob them whenever they can,\r\nas the brick-red eggs (as large as those of a swan) are considered\r\na great delicacy. A number of birds are said to join in making these\r\nmounds and lay their eggs together, so that sometimes forty or fifty\r\nmay be found. The mounds are to be met with here and there in dense\r\nthickets, and are great puzzles to strangers, who cannot understand\r\nwho can possibly have heaped together cartloads of rubbish in such\r\nout-of-the-way places; and when they inquire of the natives they are but\r\nlittle wiser, for it almost always appears to them the wildest romance\r\nto be told that it is all done by birds. The species found in Lombock\r\nis about the size of a small hen, and entirely of dark olive and\r\nbrown tints. It is a miscellaneous feeder, devouring fallen fruits,\r\nearthworms, snails, and centipedes, but the flesh is white and\r\nwell-flavoured when properly cooked.\r\n\r\nThe large green pigeons were still better eating, and were much more\r\nplentiful. These fine birds, exceeding our largest tame pigeons in size,\r\nabounded on the palm-trees, which now bore huge bunches of fruits--mere\r\nhard globular nuts, about an inch in diameter, and covered with a dry\r\ngreen skin and a very small portion of pulp. Looking at the pigeon's\r\nbill and head, it would seem impossible that it could swallow such large\r\nmasses, or that it could obtain any nourishment from them; yet I often\r\nshot these birds with several palm-fruits in the crop, which generally\r\nburst when they fell to the ground. I obtained here eight species of\r\nKingfishers; among which was a very beautiful new one, named by Mr.\r\nGould, Halcyon fulgidus. It was found always in thickets, away from\r\nwater, and seemed to feed on snails and insects picked up from the\r\nground after the manner of the great Laughing Jackass of Australia. The\r\nbeautiful little violet and orange species (Ceyx rufidorsa) is found in\r\nsimilar situations, and darts rapidly along like a flame of fire. Here\r\nalso I first met with the pretty Australian Bee-eater (Merops ornatus).\r\nThis elegant little bird sits on twigs in open places, gazing eagerly\r\naround, and darting off at intervals to seize some insect which it sees\r\nflying near; returning afterwards to the same twig to swallow it. Its\r\nlong, sharp, curved bill, the two long narrow feathers in its tail, its\r\nbeautiful green plumage varied with rich brown and black and vivid\r\nblue on the throat, render it one of the most graceful and interesting\r\nobjects a naturalist can see for the first time.\r\n\r\nOf all the birds of Lombock, however, I sought most after the beautiful\r\nground thrushes (Pitta concinna), and always thought myself lucky if\r\nI obtained one. They were found only in the dry plains densely covered\r\nwith thickets, and carpeted at this season with dead leaves. They were\r\nso shy that it was very difficult to get a shot at them, and it was only\r\nafter a good deal of practice that I discovered how to do it. The habit\r\nof these birds is to hop about on the ground, picking up insects, and on\r\nthe least alarm to run into the densest thicket or take a flight close\r\nto the ground. At intervals they utter a peculiar cry of two notes which\r\nwhen once heard is easily recognised, and they can also be heard hopping\r\nalong among the dry leaves.\r\n\r\nMy practice was, therefore, to walk cautiously along the narrow pathways\r\nwith which the country abounded, and on detecting any sign of a Pitta's\r\nvicinity to stand motionless and give a gentle whistle occasionally,\r\nimitating the notes as near as possible. After half an hour's waiting\r\nI was often rewarded by seeing the pretty bird hopping along in the\r\nthicket. Then I would perhaps lose sight of it again, until having my\r\ngun raised and ready for a shot, a second glimpse would enable me to\r\nsecure my prize, and admire its soft puffy plumage and lovely colours.\r\nThe upper part is rich soft green, the head jet black with a stripe\r\nof blue and brown over each eye; at the base of the tail and on the\r\nshoulders are bands of bright silvery blue; the under side is delicate\r\nbuff with a stripe of rich crimson, bordered with black on the belly.\r\nBeautiful grass-green doves, little crimson and black flower-peckers,\r\nlarge black cuckoos, metallic king-crows, golden orioles, and the fine\r\njungle-cocks--the origin of all our domestic breeds of poultry--were\r\namong the birds that chiefly attracted my attention during our stay at\r\nLabuan Tring.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic feature of the jungle was its thorniness. The\r\nshrubs were thorny; the creepers were thorny; the bamboos even were\r\nthorny. Everything grew zigzag and jagged, and in an inextricable\r\ntangle, so that to get through the bush with gun or net or even\r\nspectacles, was generally not to be done, and insect-catching in such\r\nlocalities was out of the question. It was in such places that the\r\nPittas often lurked, and when shot it became a matter of some difficulty\r\nto secure the bird, and seldom without a heavy payment of pricks and\r\nscratches and torn clothes could the prize be won. The dry volcanic soil\r\nand arid climate seem favourable to the production of such stunted and\r\nthorny vegetation, for the natives assured me that this was nothing\r\nto the thorns and prickles of Sumbawa whose surface still bears the\r\ncovering of volcanic ashes thrown out forty years ago by the terrible\r\neruption of Tomboro.\r\n\r\nAmong the shrubs and trees that are not prickly the Apocynaceae were\r\nmost abundant, their bilobed fruits of varied form and colour and often\r\nof most tempting appearance, hanging everywhere by the waysides as if\r\nto invite to destruction the weary traveller who may be unaware of their\r\npoisonous properties. One in particular with a smooth shining skin of\r\na golden orange colour rivals in appearance the golden apples of the\r\nHesperides, and has great attractions for many birds, from the white\r\ncockatoos to the little yellow Zosterops, who feast on the crimson seeds\r\nwhich are displayed when the fruit bursts open. The great palm called\r\n\"Gubbong\" by the natives, a species of Corypha, is the most striking\r\nfeature of the plains, where it grows by thousands and appears in three\r\ndifferent states--in leaf, in flower and fruit, or dead. It has a lofty\r\ncylindrical stem about a hundred feet high and two to three feet in\r\ndiameter; the leaves are large and fan-shaped, and fall off when the\r\ntree flowers, which it does only once in its life in a huge terminal\r\nspike, upon which are produced masses of a smooth round fruit of a green\r\ncolour and about an inch in diameter. When these ripen and fall the tree\r\ndies, and remains standing a year or two before it falls. Trees in leaf\r\nonly are by far the most numerous, then those in flower and fruit, while\r\ndead trees are scattered here and there among them. The trees in fruit\r\nare the resort of the great green fruit pigeons, which have been already\r\nmentioned. Troops of monkeys (Macacus cynomolgus) may often be\r\nseen occupying a tree, showering down the fruit in great profusion,\r\nchattering when disturbed and making an enormous rustling as they\r\nscamper off among the dead palm leaves; while the pigeons have a loud\r\nbooming voice more like the roar of a wild beast than the note of a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nMy collecting operations here were carried on under more than usual\r\ndifficulties. One small room had to serve for eating, sleeping and\r\nworking, and one for storehouse and dissecting-room; in it were no\r\nshelves, cupboards, chairs or tables; ants swarmed in every part of it,\r\nand dogs, cats and fowls entered it at pleasure. Besides this it was the\r\nparlour and reception-room of my host, and I was obliged to consult his\r\nconvenience and that of the numerous guests who visited us. My principal\r\npiece of furniture was a box, which served me as a dining table, a seat\r\nwhile skinning birds, and as the receptacle of the birds when\r\nskinned and dried. To keep them free from ants we borrowed, with\r\nsome difficulty, an old bench, the four legs of which being placed in\r\ncocoa-nut shells filled with water kept us tolerably free from these\r\npests. The box and the bench were, however, literally the only places\r\nwhere anything could be put away, and they were generally well occupied\r\nby two insect boxes and about a hundred birds' skins in process of\r\ndrying. It may therefore be easily conceived that when anything bulky\r\nor out of the common way was collected, the question \"Where is it to\r\nbe put?\" was rather a difficult one to answer. All animal substances\r\nmoreover require some time to dry thoroughly, emit a very disagreeable\r\nodour while doing so, and are particularly attractive to ants, flies,\r\ndogs, rats, cats, and other vermin, calling for special cautions and\r\nconstant supervision, which under the circumstances above described were\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nMy readers may now partially understand why a travelling naturalist of\r\nlimited means, like myself, does so much less than is expected or\r\nthan he would himself wish to do. It would be interesting to preserve\r\nskeletons of many birds and animals, reptiles and fishes in spirits,\r\nskins of the larger animals, remarkable fruits and woods and the most\r\ncurious articles of manufacture and commerce; but it will be seen\r\nthat under the circumstances I have just described, it would have\r\nbeen impossible to add these to the collections which were my own more\r\nespecial favourites. When travelling by boat the difficulties are as\r\ngreat or greater, and they are not diminished when the journey is by\r\nland. It was absolutely necessary therefore to limit my collections to\r\ncertain groups to which I could devote constant personal attention, and\r\nthus secure from destruction or decay what had been often obtained by\r\nmuch labour and pains.\r\n\r\nWhile Manuel sat skinning his birds of an afternoon, generally\r\nsurrounded by a little crowd of Malays and Sassaks (as the indigenes\r\nof Lombock are termed), he often held forth to them with the air of a\r\nteacher, and was listened to with profound attention. He was very fond\r\nof discoursing on the \"special providences\" of which he believed he was\r\ndaily the subject. \"Allah has been merciful today,\" he would say--for\r\nalthough a Christian he adopted the Mahometan mode of speech--\"and has\r\ngiven us some very fine birds; we can do nothing without him.\" Then one\r\nof the Malays would reply, \"To be sure, birds are like mankind; they\r\nhave their appointed time to die; when that time comes nothing can save\r\nthem, and if it has not come you cannot kill them.\" A murmur of assent\r\nfollow, until sentiments and cries of \"Butul! Butul!\" (Right, right.)\r\nThen Manuel would tell a long story of one of his unsuccessful\r\nhunts--how he saw some fine bird and followed it a long way, and then\r\nmissed it, and again found it, and shot two or three times at it, but\r\ncould never hit it, \"Ah!\" says an old Malay, \"its time was not come, and\r\nso it was impossible for you to kill it.\" A doctrine is this which is\r\nvery consoling to the bad marksman, and which quite accounts for the\r\nfacts, but which is yet somehow not altogether satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt is universally believed in Lombock that some men have the power to\r\nturn themselves into crocodiles, which they do for the sake of devouring\r\ntheir enemies, and many strange tales are told of such transformations.\r\nI was therefore rather surprised one evening to hear the following\r\ncurious fact stated, and as it was not contradicted by any of the\r\npersons present, I am inclined to accept it provisionally as a\r\ncontribution to the Natural History of the island. A Bornean Malay who\r\nhad been for many years resident here said to Manuel, \"One thing is\r\nstrange in this country--the scarcity of ghosts.\" \"How so?\" asked\r\nManuel. \"Why, you know,\" said the Malay, \"that in our countries to the\r\nwestward, if a man dies or is killed, we dare not pass near the place\r\nat night, for all sorts of noises are heard which show that ghosts are\r\nabout. But here there are numbers of men killed, and their bodies lie\r\nunburied in the fields and by the roadside, and yet you can walk by them\r\nat night and never hear or see anything at all, which is not the case in\r\nour country, as you know very well.\" \"Certainly I do,\" said Manuel;\r\nand so it was settled that ghosts were very scarce, if not altogether\r\nunknown in Lombock. I would observe, however, that as the evidence\r\nis purely negative we should be wanting in scientific caution if we\r\naccepted this fact as sufficiently well established.\r\n\r\nOne evening I heard Manuel, Ali, and a Malay man whispering earnestly\r\ntogether outside the door, and could distinguish various allusions to\r\n\"krisses,\" throat-cutting, heads, etc. etc. At length Manuel came\r\nin, looking very solemn and frightened, and said to me in English,\r\n\"Sir--must take care,--no safe here;--want cut throat.\" On further\r\ninquiry, I found that the Malay had been telling them that the Rajah had\r\njust sent down an order to the village, that they were to get a certain\r\nnumber of heads for an offering in the temples to secure a good crop of\r\nrice. Two or three other Malays and Bugis, as well as the Amboyna man in\r\nwhose house we lived, confirmed this account, and declared that it was a\r\nregular thing every year, and that it was necessary to keep a good\r\nwatch and never go out alone. I laughed at the whole thing, and tried to\r\npersuade them that it was a mere tale, but to no effect. They were all\r\nfirmly persuaded that their lives were in danger. Manuel would not go\r\nout shooting alone, and I was obliged to accompany him every morning,\r\nbut I soon gave him the slip in the jungle. Ali was afraid to go and\r\nlook for firewood without a companion, and would not even fetch water\r\nfrom the well a few yards behind the house unless armed with an enormous\r\nspear. I was quite sure all the time that no such order had been sent\r\nor received, and that we were in perfect safety. This was well shown\r\nshortly afterwards, when an American sailor ran away from his ship on\r\nthe east side of the island, and made his way on foot and unarmed across\r\nto Ampanam, having met with the greatest hospitality on the whole route.\r\nNowhere would the smallest payment be taken for the food and lodging\r\nwhich were willingly furbished him. On pointing out this fact to Manuel,\r\nhe replied, \"He one bad man,--run away from his ship--no one can believe\r\nword he say;\" and so I was obliged to leave him in the uncomfortable\r\npersuasion that he might any day have his throat cut.\r\n\r\nA circumstance occurred here which appeared to throw some light on the\r\ncause of the tremendous surf at Ampanam. One evening I heard a strange\r\nrumbling noise, and at the same time the house shook slightly. Thinking\r\nit might be thunder, I asked, \"What is that?\" \"It is an earthquake,\"\r\nanswered Inchi Daud, my host; and he then told me that slight shocks\r\nwere occasionally felt there, but he had never known them to be\r\nsevere. This happened on the day of the last quarter of the moon, and\r\nconsequently when tides were low and the surf usually at its weakest.\r\nOn inquiry afterwards at Ampanam, I found that no earthquake had been\r\nnoticed, but that on one night there had been a very heavy surf, which\r\nshook the house, and the next day there was a very high tide, the water\r\nhaving flooded Mr. Carter's premises, higher than he had ever known\r\nit before. These unusual tides occur every now and then, and are not\r\nthought much of; but by careful inquiry I ascertained that the surf had\r\noccurred on the very night I had felt the earthquake at Labuan Tring,\r\nnearly twenty miles off. This would seem to indicate, that although the\r\nordinary heavy surf may be due to the swell of the great Southern Ocean\r\nconfined in a narrow channel, combined with a peculiar form of bottom\r\nnear the shore, yet the sudden heavy surfs and high tides that occur\r\noccasionally in perfectly calm weather, may be due to slight upheavals\r\nof the ocean-bed in this eminently volcanic region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. LOMBOCK: MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nHAVING made a very fine and interesting collection of the birds of\r\nLabuan Tring, I took leave of my kind host, Inchi Daud, and returned\r\nto Ampanam to await an opportunity to reach Macassar. As no vessel had\r\narrived bound for that port, I determined to make an excursion into the\r\ninterior of the island, accompanied by Mr. Ross, an Englishman born in\r\nthe Keeling Islands, and now employed by the Dutch Government to settle\r\nthe affairs of a missionary who had unfortunately become bankrupt here.\r\nMr. Carter kindly lent me a horse, and Mr. Ross took his native groom.\r\n\r\nOur route for some distance lay along a perfectly level country bearing\r\nample crops of rice. The road was straight and generally bordered with\r\nlofty trees forming a fine avenue. It was at first sandy, afterwards\r\ngrassy, with occasional streams and mudholes. At a distance about four\r\nmiles we reached Mataram, the capital of the island and the residence\r\nof the Rajah. It is a large village with wide streets bordered by a\r\nmagnificent avenue of trees, and low houses concealed behind mud walls.\r\nWithin this royal city no native of the lower orders is allowed to ride,\r\nand our attendant, a Javanese, was obliged to dismount and lead his\r\nhorse while we rode slowly through. The abodes of the Rajah and of the\r\nHigh Priest are distinguished by pillars of red brick constructed with\r\nmuch taste; but the palace itself seemed to differ but little from\r\nthe ordinary houses of the country. Beyond Mataram and close to it is\r\nKarangassam, the ancient residence of the native or Sassak Rajahs before\r\nthe conquest of the island by the Balinese.\r\n\r\nSoon after passing Mataram the country began gradually to rise in\r\ngentle undulations, swelling occasionally into low hills towards the two\r\nmountainous tracts in the northern and southern parts of the island.\r\nIt was now that I first obtained an adequate idea of one of the most\r\nwonderful systems of cultivation in the world, equalling all that is\r\nrelated of Chinese industry, and as far as I know surpassing in the\r\nlabour that has been bestowed upon it any tract of equal extent in the\r\nmost civilized countries of Europe. I rode through this strange garden\r\nutterly amazed and hardly able to realize the fact that in this remote\r\nand little known island, from which all Europeans except a few traders\r\nat the port are jealously excluded, many hundreds of square miles of\r\nirregularly undulating country have been so skillfully terraced and\r\nlevelled, and so permeated by artificial channels, that every portion of\r\nit can be irrigated and dried at pleasure. According as the slope of the\r\nground is more or less rapid, each terraced plot consists in some places\r\nof many acres, in others of a few square yards. We saw them in every\r\nstate of cultivation; some in stubble, some being ploughed, some with\r\nrice-crops in various stages of growth. Here were luxuriant patches of\r\ntobacco; there, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, yams, beans or Indian-corn\r\nvaried the scene. In some places the ditches were dry, in others little\r\nstreams crossed our road and were distributed over lands about to be\r\nsown or planted. The banks which bordered every terrace rose regularly\r\nin horizontal lines above each other; sometimes rounding an abrupt knoll\r\nand looking like a fortification, or sweeping around some deep hollow\r\nand forming on a gigantic scale the seats of an amphitheatre. Every\r\nbrook and rivulet had been diverted from its bed, and instead of flowing\r\nalong the lowest ground, were to be found crossing our road half-way up\r\nan ascent, yet bordered by ancient trees and moss-grown stones so as to\r\nhave all the appearance of a natural channel, and bearing testimony\r\nto the remote period at which the work had been done. As we advanced\r\nfurther into the country, the scene was diversified by abrupt rocky\r\nhills, by steep ravines, and by clumps of bamboos and palm-trees near\r\nhouses or villages; while in the distance the fine range of mountains of\r\nwhich Lombock Peak, eight thousand feet high, is the culminating point,\r\nformed a fit background to a view scarcely to be surpassed either in\r\nhuman interest or picturesque beauty.\r\n\r\nAlong the first part of our road we passed hundreds of women carrying\r\nrice, fruit, and vegetables to market; and further on, an almost\r\nuninterrupted line of horses laden with rice in bags or in the ear, on\r\ntheir way to the port of Ampanam. At every few miles along the road,\r\nseated under shady trees or slight sheds, were sellers of sugar-cane,\r\npalm-wine, cooked rice, salted eggs, and fried plantains, with a few\r\nother native delicacies. At these stalls a hearty meal may be made for a\r\npenny, but we contented ourselves with drinking some sweet palm-wine, a\r\nmost delicious beverage in the heat of the day. After having travelled\r\nabout twenty miles we reached a higher and drier region, where, water\r\nbeing scarce, cultivation was confined to the little flats bordering the\r\nstreams. Here the country was as beautiful as before, but of a different\r\ncharacter; consisting of undulating downs of short turf interspersed\r\nwith fine clumps of trees and bushes, sometimes the woodland, sometimes\r\nthe open ground predominating. We only passed through one small patch\r\nof true forest, where we were shaded by lofty trees, and saw around us a\r\ndark and dense vegetation, highly agreeable after the heat and glare of\r\nthe open country.\r\n\r\nAt length, about an hour after noon, we reached our destination--the\r\nvillage of Coupang, situated nearly in the centre of the island--and\r\nentered the outer court of a house belonging to one of the chiefs\r\nwith whom my friend Mr. Ross had a slight acquaintance. Here we were\r\nrequested to seat ourselves under an open shed with a raised floor of\r\nbamboo, a place used to receive visitors and hold audiences. Turning our\r\nhorses to graze on the luxuriant grass of the courtyard, we waited until\r\nthe great man's Malay interpreter appeared, who inquired our business\r\nand informed us that the Pumbuckle (chief) was at the Rajah's house, but\r\nwould soon be back. As we had not yet breakfasted, we begged he would\r\nget us something to eat, which he promised to do as soon as possible. It\r\nwas however about two hours before anything appeared, when a small tray\r\nwas brought containing two saucers of rice, four small fried fish, and a\r\nfew vegetables. Having made as good a breakfast as we could, we strolled\r\nabout the village, and returning, amused ourselves by conversation\r\nwith a number of men and boys who gathered around us; and by exchanging\r\nglances and smiles with a number of women and girls who peeped at us\r\nthrough half-opened doors and other crevices. Two little boys named\r\nMousa and Isa (Moses and Jesus) were great friends with us, and an\r\nimpudent little rascal called Kachang (a bean) made us all laugh by his\r\nmimicry and antics.\r\n\r\nAt length, about four o'clock, the Pumbuckle made his appearance, and we\r\ninformed him of our desire to stay with him a few days, to shoot birds\r\nand see the country. At this he seemed somewhat disturbed, and asked if\r\nwe had brought a letter from the Anak Agong (Son of Heaven) which is the\r\ntitle of the Rajah of Lombock. This we had not done, thinking it quite\r\nunnecessary; and he then abruptly told us that he must go and speak to\r\nhis Rajah, to see if we could stay. Hours passed away, night came,\r\nand he did not return. I began to think we were suspected of some evil\r\ndesigns, for the Pumbuckle was evidently afraid of getting himself into\r\ntrouble. He is a Sassak prince, and, though a supporter of the present\r\nRajah, is related to some of the heads of a conspiracy which was quelled\r\na few years since.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock a pack-horse bearing my guns and clothes arrived,\r\nwith my men Ali and Manuel, who had come on foot. The sun set, and it\r\nsoon became dark, and we got rather hungry as we sat wearily under the\r\nshed and no one came. Still hour after hour we waited, until about nine\r\no'clock, the Pumbuckle, the Rajah, some priests, and a number of their\r\nfollowers arrived and took their seats around us. We shook hands, and\r\nfor some minutes there was a dead silence. Then the Rajah asked what\r\nwe wanted; to which Mr. Ross replied by endeavouring to make them\r\nunderstand who we were, and why we had come, and that we had no sinister\r\nintentions whatever; and that we had not brought a letter from the\r\n\"Anak Agong,\" merely because we had thought it quite unnecessary. A long\r\nconversation in the Bali language then took place, and questions were\r\nasked about my guns, and what powder I had, and whether I used shot or\r\nbullets; also what the birds were for, and how I preserved them, and\r\nwhat was done with them in England. Each of my answers and explanations\r\nwas followed by a low and serious conversation which we could not\r\nunderstand, but the purport of which we could guess. They were evidently\r\nquite puzzled, and did not believe a word we had told them. They then\r\ninquired if we were really English, and not Dutch; and although we\r\nstrongly asserted our nationality, they did not seem to believe us.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour, however, they brought us some supper (which was\r\nthe same as the breakfast, but without the fish), and after it some very\r\nweak coffee and pumpkins boiled with sugar. Having discussed this,\r\na second conference took place; questions were again asked, and\r\nthe answers again commented on. Between whiles lighter topics were\r\ndiscussed. My spectacles (concave glasses) were tried in succession by\r\nthree or four old men, who could not make out why they could not see\r\nthrough them, and the fact no doubt was another item of suspicion\r\nagainst me. My beard, too, was the subject of some admiration, and many\r\nquestions were asked about personal peculiarities which it is not the\r\ncustom to allude to in European society. At length, about one in the\r\nmorning, the whole party rose to depart, and, after conversing some time\r\nat the gate, all went away. We now begged the interpreter, who with a\r\nfew boys and men remained about us, to show us a place to sleep in, at\r\nwhich he seemed very much surprised, saying he thought we were very well\r\naccommodated where we were. It was quite chilly, and we were very thinly\r\nclad and had brought no blankets, but all we could get after another\r\nhour's talk was a native mat and pillow, and a few old curtains to hang\r\nround three sides of the open shed and protect us a little from the\r\ncold breeze. We passed the rest of the night very uncomfortably, and\r\ndetermined to return in the morning and not submit any longer to such\r\nshabby treatment.\r\n\r\nWe rose at daybreak, but it was near an hour before the interpreter\r\nmade his appearance. We then asked to have some coffee and to see the\r\nPumbuckle, as we wanted a horse for Ali, who was lame, and wished to\r\nbid him adieu. The man looked puzzled at such unheard-of demands and\r\nvanished into the inner court, locking the door behind him and leaving\r\nus again to our meditations. An hour passed and no one came, so I\r\nordered the horses to be saddled and the pack-horse to be loaded, and\r\nprepared to start. Just then the interpreter came up on horse back, and\r\nlooked aghast at our preparations. \"Where is the Pumbuckle?\" we asked.\r\n\"Gone to the Rajah's,\" said he. \"We are going,\" said I. \"Oh! pray\r\ndon't,\" said he; \"wait a little; they are having a consultation, and\r\nsome priests are coming to see you, and a chief is going off to Mataram\r\nto ask the permission of the Anak Agong for you to stay.\" This settled\r\nthe matter. More talk, more delay, and another eight or ten hours'\r\nconsultation were not to be endured; so we started at once, the poor\r\ninterpreter almost weeping at our obstinacy and hurry, and assuring us\r\n\"the Pumbuckle would be very sorry, and the Rajah would be very sorry,\r\nand if we would but wait all would be right.\" I gave Ali my horse, and\r\nstarted on foot, but he afterwards mounted behind Mr. Ross's groom, and\r\nwe got home very well, though rather hot and tired.\r\n\r\nAt Mataram we called at the house of Gusti Gadioca, one of the princes\r\nof Lombock, who was a friend of Mr. Carter's, and who had promised to\r\nshow me the guns made by native workmen. Two guns were exhibited, one\r\nsix, the other seven feet long, and of a proportionably large bore. The\r\nbarrels were twisted and well finished, though not so finely worked as\r\nours. The stock was well made, and extended to the end of the barrel.\r\nSilver and gold ornament was inlaid over most of the surface, but the\r\nlocks were taken from English muskets. The Gusti assured me, however,\r\nthat the Rajah had a man who made locks and also rifled barrels. The\r\nworkshop where these guns are made and the tools used were next shown\r\nus, and were very remarkable. An open shed with a couple of small mud\r\nforges were the chief objects visible. The bellows consisted of two\r\nbamboo cylinders, with pistons worked by hand. They move very easily,\r\nhaving a loose stuffing of feathers thickly set round the piston so\r\nas to act as a valve, and produce a regular blast. Both cylinders\r\ncommunicate with the same nozzle, one piston rising while the other\r\nfalls. An oblong piece of iron on the ground was the anvil, and a small\r\nvice was fixed on the projecting root of a tree outside. These, with a\r\nfew files and hammers, were literally the only tools with which an old\r\nman makes these fine guns, finishing then himself from the rough iron\r\nand wood.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to know how they bored these long barrels, which seemed\r\nperfectly true and are said to shoot admirably; and, on asking the\r\nGusti, received the enigmatical answer: \"We use a basket full of\r\nstones.\" Being utterly unable to imagine what he could mean, I asked if\r\nI could see how they did it, and one of the dozen little boys around\r\nus was sent to fetch the basket. He soon returned with this most\r\nextraordinary boring-machine, the mode of using which the Gusti then\r\nexplained to me. It was simply a strong bamboo basket, through the\r\nbottom of which was stuck upright a pole about three feet long, kept in\r\nits place by a few sticks tied across the top with rattans.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the pole has an iron ring, and a hole in which\r\nfour-cornered borers of hardened iron can be fitted. The barrel to be\r\nbored is buried upright in the ground, the borer is inserted into it,\r\nthe top of the stick or vertical shaft is held by a cross-piece of\r\nbamboo with a hole in it, and the basket is filled with stones to get\r\nthe required weight. Two boys turn the bamboo round. The barrels are\r\nmade in pieces of about eighteen inches long, which are first bored\r\nsmall, and then welded together upon a straight iron rod. The whole\r\nbarrel is then worked with borers of gradually increasing size, and in\r\nthree days the boring is finished. The whole matter was explained in\r\nsuch a straightforward manner that I have no doubt the process described\r\nto me was that actually used; although, when examining one of the\r\nhandsome, well-finished, and serviceable guns, it was very hard to\r\nrealize the fact that they had been made from first to last with tools\r\nhardly sufficient for an English blacksmith to make a horseshoe.\r\n\r\nThe day after we returned from our excursion, the Rajah came to Ampanam\r\nto a feast given by Gusti Gadioca, who resides there; and soon after his\r\narrival we went to have an audience. We found him in a large courtyard\r\nsitting on a mat under a shady tree; and all his followers, to the\r\nnumber of three or four hundred, squatting on the ground in a large\r\ncircle round him. He wore a sarong or Malay petticoat and a green\r\njacket. He was a man about thirty-five years of age, and of a pleasing\r\ncountenance, with some appearance of intellect combined with indecision.\r\nWe bowed, and took our seats on the ground near some chiefs we were\r\nacquainted with, for while the Rajah sits no one can stand or sit\r\nhigher. He first inquired who I was, and what I was doing in Lombock,\r\nand then requested to see some of my birds. I accordingly sent for\r\none of my boxes of bird-skins and one of insects, which he examined\r\ncarefully, and seemed much surprised that they could be so well\r\npreserved. We then had a little conversation about Europe and the\r\nRussian war, in which all natives take an interest. Having heard much of\r\na country-seat of the Rajah's called Gunong Sari, I took the opportunity\r\nto ask permission to visit it and shoot a few birds there which he\r\nimmediately granted. I then thanked him, and we took our leave.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, his son came to visit Mr. Carter accompanied by about a\r\nhundred followers, who all sat on the ground while he came into the open\r\nshed where Manuel was skinning birds. After some time he went into the\r\nhouse, had a bed arranged to sleep a little, then drank some wine, and\r\nafter an hour or two had dinner brought him from the Gusti's house,\r\nwhich he ate with eight of the principal priests and princes, he\r\npronounced a blessing over the rice and commenced eating first, after\r\nwhich the rest fell to. They rolled up balls of rice in their hands,\r\ndipped them in the gravy and swallowed them rapidly, with little pieces\r\nof meat and fowl cooked in a variety of ways. A boy fanned the young\r\nRajah while eating. He was a youth of about fifteen, and had already\r\nthree wives. All wore the kris, or Malay crooked dagger, on the beauty\r\nand value of which they greatly pride themselves. A companion of the\r\nRajah's had one with a golden handle, in which were set twenty-eight\r\ndiamonds and several other jewels. He said it had cost him £700. The\r\nsheaths are of ornamental wood and ivory, often covered on one side with\r\ngold. The blades are beautifully veined with white metal worked into\r\nthe iron, and they are kept very carefully. Every man without exception\r\ncarries a kris, stuck behind into the large waist-cloth which all wear,\r\nand it is generally the most valuable piece of property he possesses.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards our long-talked-of excursion to Gunong Sari\r\ntook place. Our party was increased by the captain and supercargo of\r\na Hamburg ship loading with rice for China. We were mounted on a very\r\nmiscellaneous lot of Lombock ponies, which we had some difficulty in\r\nsupplying with the necessary saddles, etc.; and most of us had to patch\r\nup our girths, bridles, or stirrup-leathers as best we could. We passed\r\nthrough Mataram, where we were joined by our friend Gusti Gadioca,\r\nmounted on a handsome black horse, and riding as all the natives do,\r\nwithout saddle or stirrups, using only a handsome saddlecloth and very\r\nornamental bridle.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles further, along pleasant byways, brought us to the\r\nplace. We entered through a rather handsome brick gateway supported by\r\nhideous Hindu deities in stone. Within was an enclosure with two square\r\nfish-ponds and some fine trees; then another gateway through which we\r\nentered into a park. On the right was a brick house, built somewhat in\r\nthe Hindu style, and placed on a high terrace or platform; on the left\r\na large fish-pond, supplied by a little rivulet which entered it out of\r\nthe mouth of a gigantic crocodile well executed in brick and stone. The\r\nedges of the pond were bricked, and in the centre rose a fantastic and\r\npicturesque pavilion ornamented with grotesque statues. The pond was\r\nwell stocked with fine fish, which come every morning to be fed at the\r\nsound of a wooden gong which is hung near for the purpose. On striking\r\nit a number of fish immediately came out of the masses of weed with\r\nwhich the pond abounds, and followed us along the margin expecting food.\r\nAt the same time some deer came out of as adjacent wood, which, from\r\nbeing seldom shot at and regularly fed, are almost tame. The jungle and\r\nwoods which surrounded the park appearing to abound in birds, I went to\r\nshoot a few, and was rewarded by getting several specimens of the fine\r\nnew kingfisher, Halcyon fulgidus, and the curious and handsome\r\nground thrush, Zoothera andromeda. The former belies its name by not\r\nfrequenting water or feeding on fish. It lives constantly in low damp\r\nthickets picking up ground insects, centipedes, and small mollusca.\r\nAltogether I was much pleased with my visit to this place, and it gave\r\nme a higher opinion than I had before entertained of the taste of these\r\npeople, although the style of the buildings and of the sculpture is very\r\nmuch inferior to those of the magnificent ruins in Java.\r\n\r\nI must now say a few words about the character, manners, and customs of\r\nthese interesting people.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of Lombock are termed Sassaks. They are a Malay race\r\nhardly differing in appearance from the people of Malacca or Borneo.\r\nThey are Mahometans and form the bulk of the population. The ruling\r\nclasses, on the other hand, are natives of the adjacent island of Bali,\r\nand are of the Brahminical religion. The government is an absolute\r\nmonarchy, but it seems to be conducted with more wisdom and moderation\r\nthan is usual in Malay countries. The father of the present Rajah\r\nconquered the island, and the people seem now quite reconciled to their\r\nnew rulers, who do not interfere with their religion, and probably\r\ndo not tax them any heavier than did the native chiefs they have\r\nsupplanted. The laws now in force in Lombock are very severe. Theft is\r\npunished by death. Mr. Carter informed me that a man once stole a metal\r\ncoffee-pot from his house. He was caught, the pot restored, and the\r\nman brought to Mr. Carter to punish as he thought fit. All the natives\r\nrecommended Mr. Carter to have him \"krissed\" on the spot; \"for if you\r\ndon't,\" said they, \"he will rob you again.\" Mr. Carter, however, let him\r\noff with a warning, that if he ever came inside his premises again he\r\nwould certainly be shot. A few months afterwards the same man stole a\r\nhorse from Mr. Carter. The horse was recovered, but the thief was not\r\ncaught. It is an established rule, that anyone found in a house after\r\ndark, unless with the owner's knowledge, may be stabbed, his body thrown\r\nout into the street or upon the beach, and no questions will be asked.\r\n\r\nThe men are exceedingly jealous and very strict with their wives. A\r\nmarried woman may not accept a cigar or a sirih leaf from a stranger\r\nunder pain of death. I was informed that some years ago one of the\r\nEnglish traders had a Balinese woman of good family living with him--the\r\nconnection being considered quite honourable by the natives. During some\r\nfestival this girl offended against the law by accepting a flower or\r\nsome such trifle from another man. This was reported to the Rajah (to\r\nsome of whose wives the girl was related), and he immediately sent to\r\nthe Englishman's house ordering him to give the woman up as she must be\r\n\"krissed.\" In vain he begged and prayed, and offered to pay any fine\r\nthe Rajah might impose, and finally refused to give her up unless he\r\nwas forced to do so. This the Rajah did not wish to resort to, as he no\r\ndoubt thought he was acting as much for the Englishman's honour as for\r\nhis own; so he appeared to let the matter drop. But some time afterwards\r\nhe sent one of his followers to the house, who beckoned the girl to the\r\ndoor, and then saying, \"The Rajah sends you this,\" stabbed her to the\r\nheart. More serious infidelity is punished still more cruelly, the woman\r\nand her paramour being tied back to back and thrown into the sea, where\r\nsome large crocodiles are always on the watch to devour the bodies. One\r\nsuch execution took place while I was at Ampanam, but I took a long\r\nwalk into the country to be out of the way until it was all over, thus\r\nmissing the opportunity of having a horrible narrative to enliven my\r\nsomewhat tedious story.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we were sitting at breakfast, Mr. Carter's servant\r\ninformed us that there was an \"Amok\" in the village--in other words,\r\nthat a man was \"running a muck.\" Orders were immediately given to shut\r\nand fasten the gates of our enclosure; but hearing nothing for some\r\ntime, we went out, and found there had been a false alarm, owing to a\r\nslave having run away, declaring he would \"amok,\" because his master\r\nwanted to sell him. A short time before, a man had been killed at a\r\ngaming-table because, having lost half-a-dollar more than he possessed,\r\nhe was going to \"amok.\" Another had killed or wounded seventeen people\r\nbefore he could be destroyed. In their wars a whole regiment of these\r\npeople will sometimes agree to \"amok,\" and then rush on with such\r\nenergetic desperation as to be very formidable to men not so excited\r\nas themselves. Among the ancients these would have been looked upon as\r\nheroes or demigods who sacrificed themselves for their country. Here it\r\nis simply said--they made \"amok.\"\r\n\r\nMacassar is the most celebrated place in the East for \"running a muck.\"\r\nThere are said to be one or two a month on the average, and five, ten,\r\nor twenty persons are sometimes killed or wounded at one of them. It is\r\nthe national, and therefore the honourable, mode of committing suicide\r\namong the natives of Celebes, and is the fashionable way of escaping\r\nfrom their difficulties. A Roman fell upon his sword, a Japanese rips up\r\nhis stomach, and an Englishman blows out his brains with a pistol.\r\nThe Bugis mode has many advantages to one suicidically inclined. A man\r\nthinks himself wronged by society--he is in debt and cannot pay--he is\r\ntaken for a slave or has gambled away his wife or child into slavery--he\r\nsees no way of recovering what he has lost, and becomes desperate. He\r\nwill not put up with such cruel wrongs, but will be revenged on mankind\r\nand die like a hero. He grasps his kris-handle, and the next moment\r\ndraws out the weapon and stabs a man to the heart. He runs on, with\r\nbloody kris in his hand, stabbing at everyone he meets. \"Amok! Amok!\"\r\nthen resounds through the streets. Spears, krisses, knives and guns are\r\nbrought out against him. He rushes madly forward, kills all he can--men,\r\nwomen, and children--and dies overwhelmed by numbers amid all the\r\nexcitement of a battle. And what that excitement is those who have been\r\nin one best know, but all who have ever given way to violent passions,\r\nor even indulged in violent and exciting exercises, may form a very good\r\nidea. It is a delirious intoxication, a temporary madness that absorbs\r\nevery thought and every energy. And can we wonder at the kris-bearing,\r\nuntaught, brooding Malay preferring such a death, looked upon as almost\r\nhonourable to the cold-blooded details of suicide, if he wishes to\r\nescape from overwhelming troubles, or the merciless clutches of the\r\nhangman and the disgrace of a public execution, when he has taken the\r\nlaw into his own hands and too hastily revenged himself upon his enemy?\r\nIn either case he chooses rather to \"amok.\"\r\n\r\nThe great staples of the trade of Lombock as well as of Bali are rice\r\nand coffee; the former grown on the plains, the latter on the hills. The\r\nrice is exported very largely to other islands of the Archipelago,\r\nto Singapore, and even to China, and there are generally one or more\r\nvessels loading in the port. It is brought into Ampanam on pack-horses,\r\nand almost every day a string of these would come into Mr. Carter's\r\nyard. The only money the natives will take for their rice is Chinese\r\ncopper cash, twelve hundred of which go to a dollar. Every morning two\r\nlarge sacks of this money had to be counted out into convenient sums for\r\npayment. From Bali quantities of dried beef and ox-tongues are exported,\r\nand from Lombock a good many ducks and ponies. The ducks are a peculiar\r\nbreed, which have very long flat bodies, and walk erect almost like\r\npenguins. They are generally of a pale reddish ash colour, and are kept\r\nin large flocks. They are very cheap and are largely consumed by the\r\ncrews of the rice ships, by whom they are called Baly-soldiers, but are\r\nmore generally known elsewhere as penguin-ducks.\r\n\r\nMy Portuguese bird-stuffer Fernandez now insisted on breaking his\r\nagreement and returning to Singapore; partly from homesickness, but\r\nmore I believe from the idea that his life was not worth many months'\r\npurchase among such bloodthirsty and uncivilized peoples. It was a\r\nconsiderable loss to me, as I had paid him full three times the usual\r\nwages for three months in advance, half of which was occupied in the\r\nvoyage and the rest in a place where I could have done without him,\r\nowing to there being so few insects that I could devote my own time\r\nto shooting and skinning. A few days after Fernandez had left, a small\r\nschooner came in bound for Macassar, to which place I took a passage. As\r\na fitting conclusion to my sketch of these interesting islands, I will\r\nnarrate an anecdote which I heard of the present Rajah; and which,\r\nwhether altogether true or not, well illustrates native character, and\r\nwill serve as a means of introducing some details of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the country to which I have not yet alluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. LOMBOCK: HOW THE RAJAH TOOK THE CENSUS.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Lombock was a very wise man and he showed his wisdom\r\ngreatly in the way he took the census. For my readers must know that\r\nthe chief revenues of the Rajah were derived from a head-tax of rice, a\r\nsmall measure being paid annually by every man, woman, and child in the\r\nisland, There was no doubt that every one paid this tax, for it was a\r\nvery light one, and the land was fertile and the people well off; but\r\nit had to pass through many hands before it reached the Government\r\nstorehouses. When the harvest was over the villagers brought their rice\r\nto the Kapala kampong, or head of the village; and no doubt he sometimes\r\nhad compassion for the poor or sick and passed over their short measure,\r\nand sometimes was obliged to grant a favour to those who had complaints\r\nagainst him; and then he must keep up his own dignity by having his\r\ngranaries better filled than his neighbours, and so the rice that he\r\ntook to the \"Waidono\" that was over his district was generally good deal\r\nless than it should have been. And all the \"Waidonos\" had of course to\r\ntake care of themselves, for they were all in debt and it was so easy\r\nto take a little of the Government rice, and there would still be plenty\r\nfor the Rajah. And the \"Gustis\" or princes who received the rice from\r\nthe Waidonos helped themselves likewise, and so when the harvest was all\r\nover and the rice tribute was all brought in, the quantity was found\r\nto be less each year than the one before. Sickness in one district, and\r\nfevers in another, and failure of the crops in a third, were of course\r\nalleged as the cause of this falling off; but when the Rajah went to\r\nhunt at the foot of the great mountain, or went to visit a \"Gusti\" on\r\nthe other side of the island, he always saw the villages full of people,\r\nall looking well-fed and happy. And he noticed that the krisses of\r\nhis chiefs and officers were getting handsomer and handsomer; and the\r\nhandles that were of yellow wood were changed for ivory, and those of\r\nivory were changed for gold, and diamonds and emeralds sparkled on many\r\nof them; and he knew very well which way the tribute-rice went. But as\r\nhe could not prove it he kept silence, and resolved in his own heart\r\nsomeday to have a census taken, so that he might know the number of\r\nhis people, and not be cheated out of more rice than was just and\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty was how to get this census. He could not go himself\r\ninto every village and every house, and count all the people; and if\r\nhe ordered it to be done by the regular officers they would quickly\r\nunderstand what it was for, and the census would be sure to agree\r\nexactly with the quantity of rice he got last year. It was evident\r\ntherefore that to answer his purpose no one must suspect why the census\r\nwas taken; and to make sure of this, no one must know that there was any\r\ncensus taken at all. This was a very hard problem; and the Rajah thought\r\nand thought, as hard as a Malay Rajah can be expected to think, but\r\ncould not solve it; and so he was very unhappy, and did nothing but\r\nsmoke and chew betel with his favourite wife, and eat scarcely anything;\r\nand even when he went to the cock-fight did not seem to care whether his\r\nbest birds won or lost. For several days he remained in this sad state,\r\nand all the court were afraid some evil eye had bewitched the Rajah; and\r\nan unfortunate Irish captain who had come in for a cargo of rice and\r\nwho squinted dreadfully, was very nearly being krissed, but being first\r\nbrought to the royal presence was graciously ordered to go on board and\r\nremain there while his ship stayed in the port.\r\n\r\nOne morning however, after about a week's continuance of this\r\nunaccountable melancholy, a welcome change took place, for the Rajah\r\nsent to call together all the chiefs, priests, and princes who were\r\nthen in Mataram, his capital city; and when they were all assembled in\r\nanxious expectation, he thus addressed them:\r\n\r\n\"For many days my heart has been very sick and I knew not why, but now\r\nthe trouble is cleared away, for I have had a dream. Last night the\r\nspirit of the 'Gunong Agong'--the great fire mountain--appeared to me,\r\nand told me that I must go up to the top of the mountain. All of you may\r\ncome with me to near the top, but then I must go up alone, and the\r\ngreat spirit will again appear to me and will tell me what is of great\r\nimportance to me and to you and to all the people of the island. Now go\r\nall of you and make this known through the island, and let every village\r\nfurnish men to make clear a road for us to go through the forest and up\r\nthe great mountain.\"\r\n\r\nSo the news was spread over the whole island that the Rajah must go to\r\nmeet the great spirit on the top of the mountain; and every village sent\r\nforth its men, and they cleared away the jungle and made bridges over\r\nthe mountain streams and smoothed the rough places for the Rajah's\r\npassage. And when they came to the steep and craggy rocks of the\r\nmountain, they sought out the best paths, sometimes along the bed of a\r\ntorrent, sometimes along narrow ledges of the black rocks; in one place\r\ncutting down a tall tree so as to bridge across a chasm, in another\r\nconstructing ladders to mount the smooth face of a precipice. The chiefs\r\nwho superintended the work fixed upon the length of each day's journey\r\nbeforehand according to the nature of the road, and chose pleasant\r\nplaces by the banks of clear streams and in the neighbourhood of shady\r\ntrees, where they built sheds and huts of bamboo well thatched with the\r\nleaves of palm-trees, in which the Rajah and his attendants might eat\r\nand sleep at the close of each day.\r\n\r\nAnd when all was ready, the princes and priests and chief men came again\r\nto the Rajah, to tell him what had been done and to ask him when he\r\nwould go up the mountain. And he fixed a day, and ordered every man of\r\nrank and authority to accompany him, to do honour to the great spirit\r\nwho had bid him undertake the journey, and to show how willingly they\r\nobeyed his commands. And then there was much preparation throughout\r\nthe whole island. The best cattle were killed and the meat salted\r\nand sun-dried; and abundance of red peppers and sweet potatoes were\r\ngathered; and the tall pinang-trees were climbed for the spicy betel\r\nnut, the sirih-leaf was tied up in bundles, and every man filled his\r\ntobacco pouch and lime box to the brim, so that he might not want any of\r\nthe materials for chewing the refreshing betel during the journey.\r\nThe stores of provisions were sent on a day in advance. And on the day\r\nbefore that appointed for starting, all the chiefs both great and small\r\ncame to Mataram, the abode of the king, with their horses and their\r\nservants, and the bearers of their sirih boxes, and their sleeping-mats,\r\nand their provisions. And they encamped under the tall Waringin-trees\r\nthat border all the roads about Mataram, and with blazing fires frighted\r\naway the ghouls and evil spirits that nightly haunt the gloomy avenues.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a great procession was formed to conduct the Rajah to the\r\nmountain. And the royal princes and relations of the Rajah mounted\r\ntheir black horses whose tails swept the ground; they used no saddle or\r\nstirrups, but sat upon a cloth of gay colours; the bits were of silver\r\nand the bridles of many-coloured cords. The less important people were\r\non small strong horses of various colours, well suited to a mountain\r\njourney; and all (even the Rajah) were bare-legged to above the knee,\r\nwearing only the gay coloured cotton waist-cloth, a silk or cotton\r\njacket, and a large handkerchief tastefully folded around the head.\r\nEveryone was attended by one or two servants bearing his sirih and betel\r\nboxes, who were also mounted on ponies; and great numbers more had gone\r\non in advance or waited to bring up the rear. The men in authority\r\nwere numbered by hundreds and their followers by thousands, and all the\r\nisland wondered what great thing would come of it.\r\n\r\nFor the first two days they went along good roads and through many\r\nvillages which were swept clean, and where bright cloths were hung out\r\nat the windows; and all the people, when the Rajah came, squatted down\r\nupon the ground in respect, and every man riding got off his horse and\r\nsquatted down also, and many joined the procession at every village. At\r\nthe place where they stopped for the night, the people had placed stakes\r\nalong each side of the roads in front of the houses. These were split\r\ncrosswise at the top, and in the cleft were fastened little clay lamps,\r\nand between them were stuck the green leaves of palm-trees, which,\r\ndripping with the evening dew, gleamed prettily with the many twinkling\r\nlights. And few went to sleep that night until the morning hours,\r\nfor every house held a knot of eager talkers, and much betel-nut was\r\nconsumed, and endless were the conjectures what would come of it.\r\n\r\nOn the second day they left the last village behind them and entered the\r\nwild country that surrounds the great mountain, and rested in the huts\r\nthat had been prepared for them on the banks of a stream of cold and\r\nsparkling water. And the Rajah's hunters, armed with long and heavy\r\nguns, went in search of deer and wild bulls in the surrounding woods,\r\nand brought home the meat of both in the early morning, and sent it on\r\nin advance to prepare the mid-day meal. On the third day they advanced\r\nas far as horses could go, and encamped at the foot of high rocks, among\r\nwhich narrow pathways only could be found to reach the mountain-top. And\r\non the fourth morning when the Rajah set out, he was accompanied only\r\nby a small party of priests and princes with their immediate attendants;\r\nand they toiled wearily up the rugged way, and sometimes were carried\r\nby their servants, until they passed up above the great trees, and then\r\namong the thorny bushes, and above them again on to the black and burned\r\nrock of the highest part of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAnd when they were near the summit, the Rajah ordered them all to halt,\r\nwhile he alone went to meet the great spirit on the very peak of the\r\nmountain. So he went on with two boys only who carried his sirih and\r\nbetel, and soon reached the top of the mountain among great rocks, on\r\nthe edge of the great gulf whence issue forth continually smoke and\r\nvapour. And the Rajah asked for sirih, and told the boys to sit down\r\nunder a rock and look down the mountain, and not to move until he\r\nreturned to them. And as they were tired, and the sun was warm and\r\npleasant, and the rock sheltered them from the cold wind, the boys fell\r\nasleep. And the Rajah went a little way on under another rock; and as he\r\nwas tired, and the sun was warm and pleasant, and he too fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd those who were waiting for the Rajah thought him a long time on the\r\ntop of the mountain, and thought the great spirit must have much to say,\r\nor might perhaps want to keep him on the mountain always, or perhaps he\r\nhad missed his way in coming down again. And they were debating whether\r\nthey should go and search for him, when they saw him coming down with\r\nthe two boys. And when he met them he looked very grave, but said\r\nnothing; and then all descended together, and the procession returned\r\nas it had come; and the Rajah went to his palace and the chiefs to\r\ntheir villages, and the people to their houses, to tell their wives and\r\nchildren all that had happened, and to wonder yet again what would come\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAnd three days afterwards the Rajah summoned the priests and the princes\r\nand the chief men of Mataram, to hear what the great spirit had told him\r\non the top of the mountain. And when they were all assembled, and the\r\nbetel and sirih had been handed round, he told them what had happened.\r\nOn the top of the mountain he had fallen into a trance, and the great\r\nspirit had appeared to him with a face like burnished gold, and had\r\nsaid--\"Oh Rajah! much plague and sickness and fevers are coming upon all\r\nthe earth, upon men and upon horses and upon cattle; but as you and\r\nyour people have obeyed me and have come up to my great mountain, I will\r\nteach you how you and all the people of Lombock may escape this plague.\"\r\nAnd all waited anxiously, to hear how they were to be saved from so\r\nfearful a calamity. And after a short silence the Rajah spoke again\r\nand told them, that the great spirit had commanded that twelve sacred\r\nkrisses should be made, and that to make them every village and every\r\ndistrict must send a bundle of needles--a needle for every head in the\r\nvillage. And when any grievous disease appeared in any village, one\r\nof the sacred krisses should be sent there; and if every house in\r\nthat village had sent the right number of needles, the disease would\r\nimmediately cease; but if the number of needles sent had not been exact,\r\nthe kris would have no virtue.\r\n\r\nSo the princes and chiefs sent to all their villages and communicated\r\nthe wonderful news; and all made haste to collect the needles with the\r\ngreatest accuracy, for they feared that if but one were wanting, the\r\nwhole village would suffer. So one by one the head men of the villages\r\nbrought in their bundles of needles; those who were near Mataram came\r\nfirst, and those who were far off came last; and the Rajah received them\r\nwith his own hands and put them away carefully in an inner chamber, in a\r\ncamphor-wood chest whose hinges and clasps were of silver; and on every\r\nbundle was marked the name of the village and the district from whence\r\nit came, so that it might be known that all had heard and obeyed the\r\ncommands of the great spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was quite certain that every village had sent in its bundle,\r\nthe Rajah divided the needles into twelve equal parts, and ordered the\r\nbest steelworker in Mataram to bring his forge and his bellows and his\r\nhammers to the palace, and to make the twelve krisses under the Rajah's\r\neye, and in the sight of all men who chose to see it. And when they were\r\nfinished, they were wrapped up in new silk and put away carefully until\r\nthey might be wanted.\r\n\r\nNow the journey to the mountain was in the time of the east wind when no\r\nrain falls in Lombock. And soon after the krisses were made it was the\r\ntime of the rice harvest, and the chiefs of districts and of villages\r\nbrought their tax to the Rajah according to the number of heads in their\r\nvillages. And to those that wanted but little of the full amount, the\r\nRajah said nothing; but when those came who brought only half or a\r\nfourth part of what was strictly due, he said to them mildly, \"The\r\nneedles which you sent from your village were many more than came from\r\nsuch-a-one's village, yet your tribute is less than his; go back and see\r\nwho it is that has not paid the tax.\" And the next year the produce of\r\nthe tax increased greatly, for they feared that the Rajah might justly\r\nkill those who a second time kept back the right tribute. And so the\r\nRajah became very rich, and increased the number of his soldiers, and\r\ngave golden jewels to his wives, and bought fine black horses from the\r\nwhite-skinned Hollanders, and made great feasts when his children were\r\nborn or were married; and none of the Rajahs or Sultans among the Malays\r\nwere so great or powerful as the Rajah of Lombock.\r\n\r\nAnd the twelve sacred krisses had great virtue. And, when any sickness\r\nappeared in a village one of them was sent for; and sometimes the\r\nsickness went away, and then the sacred kris was taken back again with\r\ngreat Honour, and the head men of the village came to tell the Rajah of\r\nits miraculous power, and to thank him. And sometimes the sickness would\r\nnot go away; and then everybody was convinced that there had been a\r\nmistake in the number of needles sent from that village, and therefore\r\nthe sacred kris had no effect, and had to be taken back again by the\r\nhead men with heavy hearts, but still, with all honour--for was not the\r\nfault their own?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. TIMOR.\r\n\r\n (COUPANG, 1857-1869. DELLI, 1861.)\r\n\r\nTHE island of Timor is about three hundred miles long and sixty wide,\r\nand seems to form the termination of the great range of volcanic islands\r\nwhich begins with Sumatra more than two thousand miles to the west. It\r\ndiffers however very remarkably from all the other islands of the chain\r\nin not possessing any active volcanoes, with the one exception of Timor\r\nPeak near the centre of the island, which was formerly active, but was\r\nblown up during an eruption in 1638 and has since been quiescent. In no\r\nother part of Timor do there appear to be any recent igneous rocks, so\r\nthat it can hardly be classed as a volcanic island. Indeed its position\r\nis just outside of the great volcanic belt, which extends from Flores\r\nthrough Ombay and Wetter to Banda.\r\n\r\nI first visited Timor in 1857, staying a day at Coupang, the chief Dutch\r\ntown at the west end of the island; and again in May 1859, when I stayed\r\na fortnight in the same neighbourhood. In the spring of 1861 I spent\r\nfour months at Delli, the capital of the Portuguese possessions in the\r\neastern part of the island.\r\n\r\nThe whole neighbourhood of Coupang appears to have been elevated at a\r\nrecent epoch, consisting of a rugged surface of coral rock, which rises\r\nin a vertical wall between the beach and the town, whose low, white,\r\nred-tiled houses give it an appearance very similar to other Dutch\r\nsettlements in the East. The vegetation is everywhere scanty and\r\nscrubby. Plants of the families Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae, abound;\r\nbut there is nothing that can be called a forest, and the whole country\r\nhas a parched and desolate appearance, contrasting strongly with\r\nthe lofty forest trees and perennial verdure of the Moluccas or of\r\nSingapore. The most conspicuous feature of the vegetation was the\r\nabundance of fine fan-leaved palms (Borassus flabelliformis), from the\r\nleaves of which are constructed the strong and durable water-buckets in\r\ngeneral use, and which are much superior to those formed from any other\r\nspecies of palm. From the same tree, palm-wine and sugar are made, and\r\nthe common thatch for houses formed of the leaves lasts six or seven\r\nyears without removal. Close to the town I noticed the foundation of\r\na ruined house below high-water mark, indicating recent subsidence.\r\nEarthquakes are not severe here, and are so infrequent and harmless that\r\nthe chief houses are built of stone.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Coupang consist of Malays, Chinese, and Dutch,\r\nbesides the natives, so that there are many strange and complicated\r\nmixtures among the population. There is one resident English merchant,\r\nand whalers as well as Australian ships often come here for stores and\r\nwater. The native Timorese preponderate, and a very little examination\r\nserves to show that they have nothing in common with Malays, but are\r\nmuch more closely allied to the true Papuans of the Aru Islands and New\r\nGuinea. They are tall, have pronounced features, large somewhat aquiline\r\nnoses, and frizzly hair, and are generally of a dusky brown colour. The\r\nway in which the women talk to each other and to the men, their loud\r\nvoices and laughter, and general character of self-assertion, would\r\nenable an experienced observer to decide, even without seeing them, that\r\nthey were not Malays.\r\n\r\nMr. Arndt, a German and the Government doctor, invited me to stay at\r\nhis house while in Coupang, and I gladly accepted his offer, as I only\r\nintended making a short visit. We at first began speaking French, but\r\nhe got on so badly that we soon passed insensibly into Malay; and\r\nwe afterwards held long discussions on literary, scientific, and\r\nphilosophical questions in that semi-barbarous language, whose\r\ndeficiencies we made up by the free use of French or Latin words.\r\n\r\nAfter a few walks in the neighbourhood of the town, I found such a\r\npoverty of insects and birds that I determined to go for a few days to\r\nthe island of Semao at the western extremity of Timor, where I heard\r\nthat there was forest country with birds not found at Coupang. With some\r\ndifficulty I obtained a large dugout boat with outriggers, to take me\r\nover a distance of about twenty miles. I found the country pretty well\r\nwooded, but covered with shrubs and thorny bushes rather than\r\nforest trees, and everywhere excessively parched and dried up by the\r\nlong-continued dry season. I stayed at the village of Oeassa, remarkable\r\nfor its soap springs. One of these is in the middle of the village,\r\nbubbling out from a little cone of mud to which the ground rises all\r\nround like a volcano in miniature. The water has a soapy feel and\r\nproduces a strong lather when any greasy substance is washed in it.\r\nIt contains alkali and iodine, in such quantities as to destroy all\r\nvegetation for some distance around. Close by the village is one of\r\nthe finest springs I have ever seen, contained in several rocky basins\r\ncommunicating by narrow channels. These have been neatly walled where\r\nrequired and partly levelled, and form fine natural baths. The water\r\nis well tasted and clear as crystal, and the basins are surrounded by\r\na grove of lofty many-stemmed banyan-trees, which keep them always cool\r\nand shady, and add greatly to the picturesque beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe village consists of curious little houses very different from any I\r\nhave seen elsewhere. They are of an oval figure, and the walls are made\r\nof sticks about four feet high placed close together. From this rises a\r\nhigh conical roof thatched with grass. The only opening is a door about\r\nthree feet high. The people are like the Timorese with frizzly or wavy\r\nhair and of a coppery brown colour. The better class appear to have a\r\nmixture of some superior race which has much improved their features.\r\nI saw in Coupang some chiefs from the island of Savu further west,\r\nwho presented characters very distinct from either the Malay or Papuan\r\nraces. They most resembled Hindus, having fine well-formed features and\r\nstraight thin noses with clear brown complexions. As the Brahminical\r\nreligion once spread over all Java, and even now exists in Bali and\r\nLombock, it is not at all improbable that some natives of India should\r\nhave reached this island, either by accident or to escape persecution,\r\nand formed a permanent settlement there.\r\n\r\nI stayed at Oeassa four days, when, not finding any insects and very few\r\nnew birds, I returned to Coupang to await the next mail steamer. On the\r\nway I had a narrow escape of being swamped. The deep coffin-like boat\r\nwas filled up with my baggage, and with vegetables, cocoa-nut and other\r\nfruit for Coupang market, and when we had got some way across into a\r\nrather rough sea, we found that a quantity of water was coming in which\r\nwe had no means of baling out. This caused us to sink deeper in the\r\nwater, and then we shipped seas over our sides, and the rowers, who had\r\nbefore declared it was nothing, now became alarmed and turned the boat\r\nround to get back to the coast of Semao, which was not far off. By\r\nclearing away some of the baggage a little of the water could be baled\r\nout, but hardly so fast as it came in, and when we neared the coast\r\nwe found nothing but vertical walls of rock against which the sea was\r\nviolently beating. We coasted along some distance until we found\r\na little cove, into which we ran the boat, hauled it on shore, and\r\nemptying it found a large hole in the bottom, which had been temporarily\r\nstopped up with a plug of cocoa-nut which had come out. Had we been a\r\nquarter of a mile further off before we discovered the leak, we should\r\ncertainly have been obliged to throw most of our baggage overboard,\r\nand might easily have lost our lives. After we had put all straight and\r\nsecure we again started, and when we were halfway across got into such a\r\nstrong current and high cross sea that we were very nearly being swamped\r\na second time, which made me vow never to trust myself again in such\r\nsmall and miserable vessels.\r\n\r\nThe mail steamer did not arrive for a week, and I occupied myself in\r\ngetting as many of the birds as I could, and found some which were very\r\ninteresting. Among them were five species of pigeons of as many distinct\r\ngenera, and most of them peculiar to the island; two parrots--the fine\r\nred-winged broad-tail (Platycercus vulneratus), allied to an\r\nAustralian species, and a green species of the genus Geoffroyus. The\r\nTropidorhynchus timorensis was as ubiquitous and as noisy as I had found\r\nit at Lombock; and the Sphaecothera viridis, a curious green oriole\r\nwith bare red orbits, was a great acquisition. There were several\r\npretty finches, warblers, and flycatchers, and among them I obtained the\r\nelegant blue and red Cyornis hyacinthina; but I cannot recognise among\r\nmy collections the species mentioned by Dampier, who seems to have been\r\nmuch struck by the number of small songbirds in Timor. He says: \"One\r\nsort of these pretty little birds my men called the ringing bird,\r\nbecause it had six notes, and always repeated all his notes twice, one\r\nafter the other, beginning high and shrill and ending low. The bird was\r\nabout the bigness of a lark, having a small, sharp, black bill and blue\r\nwings; the head and breast were of a pale red, and there was a blue\r\nstreak about its neck.\" In Semao, monkeys are abundant. They are the\r\ncommon hare-lipped monkey (Macacus cynomolgus), which is found all over\r\nthe western islands of the Archipelago, and may have been introduced by\r\nnatives, who often carry it about captive. There are also some deer,\r\nbut it is not quite certain whether they are of the same species as are\r\nfound in Java.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Delli, the capital of the Portuguese possessions in\r\nTimor, on January 12, 1861, and was kindly received by Captain Hart, an\r\nEnglishman and an old resident, who trades in the produce of the country\r\nand cultivates coffee on an estate at the foot of the hills. With him\r\nI was introduced to Mr. Geach, a mining-engineer who had been for two\r\nyears endeavouring to discover copper in sufficient quantity to be worth\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nDelli is a most miserable place compared with even the poorest of the\r\nDutch towns. The houses are all of mud and thatch; the fort is only a\r\nmud enclosure; and the custom-house and church are built of the same\r\nmean materials, with no attempt at decoration or even neatness. The\r\nwhole aspect of the place is that of a poor native town, and there is no\r\nsign of cultivation or civilization round about it. His Excellency\r\nthe Governor's house is the only one that makes any pretensions to\r\nappearance, and that is merely a low whitewashed cottage or bungalow.\r\nYet there is one thing in which civilization exhibits itself--officials\r\nin black and white European costume, and officers in gorgeous uniforms\r\nabound in a degree quite disproportionate to the size or appearance of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe town being surrounded for some distance by swamps and mudflats is\r\nvery unhealthy, and a single night often gives a fever to newcomers\r\nwhich not unfrequently proves fatal. To avoid this malaria, Captain Hart\r\nalways slept at his plantation, on a slight elevation about two miles\r\nfrom the town, where Mr. Geach also had a small house, which he kindly\r\ninvited me to share. We rode there in the evening; and in the course of\r\ntwo days my baggage was brought up, and I was able to look about me and\r\nsee if I could do any collecting.\r\n\r\nFor the first few weeks I was very unwell and could not go far from the\r\nhouse. The country was covered with low spiny shrubs and acacias, except\r\nin a little valley where a stream came down from the hills, where some\r\nfine trees and bushes shaded the water and formed a very pleasant place\r\nto ramble up. There were plenty of birds about, and of a tolerable\r\nvariety of species; but very few of them were gaily coloured. Indeed,\r\nwith one or two exceptions, the birds of this tropical island were\r\nhardly so ornamental as those of Great Britain. Beetles were so scarce\r\nthat a collector might fairly say there were none, as the few obscure\r\nor uninteresting species would not repay him for the search. The only\r\ninsects at all remarkable or interesting were the butterflies, which,\r\nthough comparatively few in species, were sufficiently abundant, and\r\ncomprised a large proportion of new or rare sorts. The banks of the\r\nstream formed my best collecting-ground, and I daily wandered up and\r\ndown its shady bed, which about a mile up became rocky and precipitous.\r\nHere I obtained the rare and beautiful swallow-tail butterflies, Papilio\r\naenomaus and P. liris; the males of which are quite unlike each other,\r\nand belong in fact to distinct sections of the genus, while the females\r\nare so much alike that they are undistinguishable on the wing, and to\r\nan uneducated eye equally so in the cabinet. Several other beautiful\r\nbutterflies rewarded my search in this place, among which I may\r\nespecially mention the Cethosia leschenaultii, whose wings of the\r\ndeepest purple are bordered with buff in such a manner as to resemble\r\nat first sight our own Camberwell beauty, although it belongs to a\r\ndifferent genus. The most abundant butterflies were the whites and\r\nyellows (Pieridae), several of which I had already found at Lombock and\r\nat Coupang, while others were new to me.\r\n\r\nEarly in February we made arrangements to stay for a week at a village\r\ncalled Baliba, situated about four miles off on the mountains, at\r\nan elevation of 2,000 feet. We took our baggage and a supply of all\r\nnecessaries on packhorses; and though the distance by the route we took\r\nwas not more than six or seven miles, we were half a day getting there.\r\nThe roads were mere tracks, sometimes up steep rocky stairs, sometimes\r\nin narrow gullies worn by the horses' feet, and where it was necessary\r\nto tuck up our legs on our horses' necks to avoid having them crushed.\r\nAt some of these places the baggage had to be unloaded, at others it was\r\nknocked off. Sometimes the ascent or descent was so steep that it was\r\neasier to walk than to cling to our ponies' backs; and thus we went up\r\nand down over bare hills whose surface was covered with small pebbles\r\nand scattered over with Eucalypti, reminding me of what I had read of\r\nparts of the interior of Australia rather than of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe village consisted of three houses only, with low walls raised a few\r\nfeet on posts, and very high roofs thatched with grass hanging down to\r\nwithin two or three feet of the ground. A house which was unfinished and\r\npartly open at the back was given for our use, and in it we rigged up\r\na table, some benches, and a screen, while an inner enclosed portion\r\nserved us for a sleeping apartment. We had a splendid view down upon\r\nDelli and the sea beyond. The country around was undulating and open,\r\nexcept in the hollows, where there were some patches of forest, which\r\nMr. Geach, who had been all over the eastern part of Timor, assured me\r\nwas the most luxuriant he had yet seen in the island. I was in hopes of\r\nfinding some insects here, but was much disappointed, owing perhaps to\r\nthe dampness of the climate; for it was not until the sun was pretty\r\nhigh that the mists cleared away, and by noon we were generally clouded\r\nup again, so that there was seldom more than an hour or two of fitful\r\nsunshine. We searched in every direction for birds and other game,\r\nbut they were very scarce. On our way I had shot the fine white-headed\r\npigeon, Ptilonopus cinctus, and the pretty little lorikeet,\r\nTrichoglossus euteles. I got a few more of these at the blossoms of the\r\nEucalypti, and also the allied species Trichoglossus iris, and a few\r\nother small but interesting birds. The common jungle-cock of India\r\n(Gallus bankiva) was found here, and furnished us with some excellent\r\nmeals; but we could get no deer. Potatoes are grown higher up the\r\nmountains in abundance, and are very good. We had a sheep killed every\r\nother day, and ate our mutton with much appetite in the cool climate,\r\nwhich rendered a fire always agreeable.\r\n\r\nAlthough one-half the European residents in Delli are continually\r\nill from fever, and the Portuguese have occupied the place for three\r\ncenturies, no one has yet built a house on these fine hills, which, if\r\na tolerable road were made, would be only an hour's ride from the town;\r\nand almost equally good situations might be found on a lower level at\r\nhalf an hour's distance. The fact that potatoes and wheat of excellent\r\nquality are grown in abundance at from 3,000 to 3,500 feet elevation,\r\nshows what the climate and soil are capable of if properly cultivated.\r\nFrom one to two thousand feet high, coffee would thrive; and there are\r\nhundreds of square miles of country over which all the varied products\r\nwhich require climates between those of coffee and wheat would flourish;\r\nbut no attempt has yet been made to form a single mile of road, or a\r\nsingle acre of plantation!\r\n\r\nThere must be something very unusual in the climate of Timor to permit\r\nwheat being grown at so moderate an elevation. The grain is of excellent\r\nquality, the bread made from it being equal to any I have ever tasted,\r\nand it is universally acknowledged to be unsurpassed by any made from\r\nimported European or American flour. The fact that the natives have\r\n(quite of their own accord) taken to cultivating such foreign articles\r\nas wheat and potatoes, which they bring in small quantities on the backs\r\nof ponies by the most horrible mountain tracks, and sell very cheaply\r\nat the seaside, sufficiently indicates what might be done if good roads\r\nwere made, and if the people were taught, encouraged, and protected.\r\nSheep also do well on the mountains; and a breed of hardy ponies in much\r\nrepute all over the Archipelago, runs half-wild, so that it appears as\r\nif this island, so barren-looking and devoid of the usual features of\r\ntropical vegetation, were yet especially adapted to supply a variety\r\nof products essential to Europeans, which the other islands will not\r\nproduce, and which they accordingly import from the other side of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February my friend Mr. Geach left Timor, having finally\r\nreported that no minerals worth working were to be found. The Portuguese\r\nwere very much annoyed, having made up their minds that copper is\r\nabundant, and still believing it to be so. It appears that from time\r\nimmemorial pure native copper has been found at a place on the coast\r\nabout thirty miles east of Delli.\r\n\r\nThe natives say they find it in the bed of a ravine, and many years ago\r\na captain of a vessel is said to have got some hundreds-weight of it.\r\nNow, however, it is evidently very scarce, as during the two years Mr.\r\nGeach resided in the country, none was found. I was shown one piece\r\nseveral pounds' weight, having much the appearance of one of the larger\r\nAustralian nuggets, but of pure copper instead of gold. The natives and\r\nthe Portuguese have very naturally imagined that where these fragments\r\ncome from there must be more; and they have a report or tradition,\r\nthat a mountain at the head of the ravine is almost pure copper, and of\r\ncourse of immense value.\r\n\r\nAfter much difficulty a company was at length formed to work the copper\r\nmountain, a Portuguese merchant of Singapore supplying most of the\r\ncapital. So confident were they of the existence of the copper, that\r\nthey thought it would be waste of time and money to have any exploration\r\nmade first; and accordingly, sent to England for a mining engineer, who\r\nwas to bring out all necessary tools, machinery, laboratory, utensils, a\r\nnumber of mechanics, and stores of all kinds for two years, in order to\r\ncommence work on a copper-mine which he was told was already discovered.\r\nOn reaching Singapore a ship was freighted to take the men and stores to\r\nTimor, where they at length arrived after much delay, a long voyage, and\r\nvery great expense.\r\n\r\nA day was then fixed to \"open the mines.\" Captain Hart accompanied Mr.\r\nGeach as interpreter. The Governor, the Commandante, the Judge, and all\r\nthe chief people of the place went in state to the mountain, with Mr.\r\nGeach's assistant and some of the workmen. As they went up the valley\r\nMr. Geach examined the rocks, but saw no signs of copper. They went on\r\nand on, but still nothing except a few mere traces of very poor ore. At\r\nlength they stood on the copper mountain itself. The Governor stopped,\r\nthe officials formed a circle, and he then addressed them, saying, that\r\nat length the day had arrived they had all been so long expecting, when\r\nthe treasures of the soil of Timor would be brought to light, and much\r\nmore in very grandiloquent Portuguese; and concluded by turning to Mr.\r\nGeach, and requesting him to point out the best spot for them to begin\r\nwork at once, and uncover the mass of virgin copper. As the ravines and\r\nprecipices among which they had passed, and which had been carefully\r\nexamined, revealed very clearly the nature and mineral constitution of\r\nthe country, Mr. Geach simply told them that there was not a trace\r\nof copper there, and that it was perfectly useless to begin work. The\r\naudience were thunderstruck! The Governor could not believe his ears. At\r\nlength, when Mr. Geach had repeated his statement, the Governor told him\r\nseverely that he was mistaken; that they all knew there was copper\r\nthere in abundance, and all they wanted him to tell them, as a\r\nmining-engineer, was how best to get at it; and that at all events he\r\nwas to begin work somewhere. This Mr. Geach refused to do, trying to\r\nexplain that the ravines had cut far deeper into the hill than he could\r\ndo in years, and that he would not throw away money or time on any such\r\nuseless attempt. After this speech had been interpreted to him, the\r\nGovernor saw it was no use, and without saying a word turned his horse\r\nand rode away, leaving my friends alone on the mountain. They all\r\nbelieved there was some conspiracy that the Englishman would not find\r\nthe copper, and that they had been cruelly betrayed.\r\n\r\nMr. Geach then wrote to the Singapore merchant who was his employer,\r\nand it was arranged that he should send the mechanics home again, and\r\nhimself explore the country for minerals. At first the Government threw\r\nobstacles in his way and entirely prevented his moving; but at length\r\nhe was allowed to travel about, and for more than a year he and his\r\nassistant explored the eastern part of Timor, crossing it in several\r\nplaces from sea to sea, and ascending every important valley, without\r\nfinding any minerals that would pay the expense of working. Copper ore\r\nexists in several places, but always too poor in quality. The best\r\nwould pay well if situated in England; but in the interior of an utterly\r\nbarren country, with roads to make, and all skilled labour and materials\r\nto import, it would have been a losing concern. Gold also occurs, but\r\nvery sparingly and of poor quality. A fine spring of pure petroleum was\r\ndiscovered far in the interior, where it can never be available until\r\nthe country is civilized. The whole affair was a dreadful disappointment\r\nto the Portuguese Government, who had considered it such a certain thing\r\nthat they had contracted for the Dutch mail steamers to stop at\r\nDelli and several vessels from Australia were induced to come with\r\nmiscellaneous cargoes, for which they expected to find a ready sale\r\namong the population at the newly-opened mines. The lumps of native\r\ncopper are still, however, a mystery. Mr. Geach has examined the country\r\nin every direction without being able to trace their origin; so that it\r\nseems probable that they result from the debris of old copper-bearing\r\nstrata, and are not really more abundant than gold nuggets are in\r\nAustralia or California. A high reward was offered to any native who\r\nshould find a piece and show the exact spot where he obtained it, but\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineers of Timor are a people of Papuan type, having rather\r\nslender forms, bushy frizzled hair, and the skin of a dusky brown\r\ncolour. They have the long nose with overhanging apex which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the Papuan, and so absolutely unknown among races of\r\nMalayan origin. On the coast there has been much admixture of some of\r\nthe Malay races, and perhaps of Hindu, as well as of Portuguese. The\r\ngeneral stature there is lower, the hair wavy instead of frizzled, and\r\nthe features less prominent. The houses are built on the ground, while\r\nthe mountaineers raise theirs on posts three or four feet high. The\r\ncommon dress is a long cloth, twisted around the waist and hanging\r\nto the knee, as shown in the illustration (page 305), copied from a\r\nphotograph. Both men carry the national umbrella, made of an entire\r\nfan-shaped palm leaf, carefully stitched at the fold of each leaflet to\r\nprevent splitting. This is opened out, and held sloping over the head\r\nand back during a shower. The small water-bucket is made from an entire\r\nunopened leaf of the same palm, and the covered bamboo probably contains\r\nhoney for sale. A curious wallet is generally carried, consisting of a\r\nsquare of strongly woven cloth, the four corners of which are connected\r\nby cords, and often much ornamented with beads and tassels. Leaning\r\nagainst the house behind the figure on the right are bamboos, used\r\ninstead of water jars.\r\n\r\nA prevalent custom is the \"pomali,\" exactly equivalent to the \"taboo\"\r\nof the Pacific islanders, and equally respected. It is used on the\r\ncommonest occasions, and a few palm leaves stuck outside a garden as\r\na sign of the \"pomali\" will preserve its produce from thieves as\r\neffectually as the threatening notice of man-traps, spring guns, or a\r\nsavage dog would do with us. The dead are placed on a stage, raised six\r\nor eight feet above the ground, sometimes open and sometimes covered\r\nwith a roof. Here the body remains until the relatives can afford\r\nto make a feast, when it is buried. The Timorese are generally great\r\nthieves, but are not bloodthirsty. They fight continually among\r\nthemselves, and take every opportunity of kidnapping unprotected people\r\nof other tribes for slaves; but Europeans may pass anywhere through the\r\ncountry in safety. Except for a few half-breeds in the town, there are\r\nno native Christians in the island of Timor. The people retain their\r\nindependence in a great measure, and both dislike and despise their\r\nwould-be rulers, whether Portuguese or Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese government in Timor is a most miserable one. Nobody seems\r\nto care the least about the improvement of the country, and at this\r\ntime, after three hundred years of occupation, there has not been a\r\nmile of road made beyond the town, and there is not a solitary European\r\nresident anywhere in the interior. All the Government officials oppress\r\nand rob the natives as much as they can, and yet there is no care taken\r\nto render the town defensible should the Timorese attempt to attack\r\nit. So ignorant are the military officers, that having received a small\r\nmortar and some shells, no one could be found who knew how to use them;\r\nand during an insurrection of the natives (while I was at Delli) the\r\nofficer who expected to be sent against the insurgents was instantly\r\ntaken ill! And they were allowed to get possession of an important\r\npass within three miles of the town, where they could defend themselves\r\nagainst ten times the force. The result was that no provisions were\r\nbrought down from the hills; a famine was imminent; and the Governor had\r\nto send off to beg for supplies from the Dutch Governor of Amboyna.\r\n\r\nIn its present state Timor is more trouble than profit to its Dutch\r\nand Portuguese rulers, and it will continue to be so unless a different\r\nsystem is pursued. A few good roads into the elevated districts of the\r\ninterior; a conciliatory policy and strict justice towards the natives,\r\nand the introduction of a good system of cultivation as in Java and\r\nnorthern Celebes, might yet make Timor a productive and valuable island.\r\nRice grows well on the marshy flats, which often fringe the coast, and\r\nmaize thrives in all the lowlands, and is the common food of the natives\r\nas it was when Dampier visited the island in 1699. The small quantity of\r\ncoffee now grown is of very superior quality, and it might be increased\r\nto any extent. Sheep thrive, and would always be valuable as fresh food\r\nfor whalers and to supply the adjacent islands with mutton, if not for\r\ntheir wool; although it is probable that on the mountains this product\r\nmight soon be obtained by judicious breeding. Horses thrive amazingly;\r\nand enough wheat might be grown to supply the whole Archipelago if there\r\nwere sufficient inducements to the natives to extend its cultivation,\r\nand good roads by which it could be cheaply transported to the coast.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system the natives would soon perceive that European\r\ngovernment was advantageous to them. They would begin to save money, and\r\nproperty being rendered secure they would rapidly acquire new wants and\r\nnew tastes, and become large consumers of European goods. This would be\r\na far surer source of profit to their rulers than imposts and extortion,\r\nand would be at the same time more likely to produce peace and obedience\r\nthan the mock-military rule which has hitherto proved most ineffective.\r\nTo inaugurate such a system would however require an immediate outlay of\r\ncapital, which neither Dutch nor Portuguese seem inclined to make, and\r\na number of honest and energetic officials, which the latter nation\r\nat least seems unable to produce; so that it is much to be feared that\r\nTimor will for many years to come remain in its present state of chronic\r\ninsurrection and misgovernment.\r\n\r\nMorality at Delli is at as low an ebb as in the far interior of Brazil,\r\nand crimes are connived at which would entail infamy and criminal\r\nprosecution in Europe. While I was there it was generally asserted and\r\nbelieved in the place, that two officers had poisoned the husbands of\r\nwomen with whom they were carrying on intrigues, and with whom they\r\nimmediately cohabited on the death of their rivals. Yet no one ever\r\nthought for a moment of showing disapprobation of the crime, or even\r\nof considering it a crime at all, the husbands in question being low\r\nhalf-castes, who of course ought to make way for the pleasures of their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nJudging from what I saw myself and by the descriptions of Mr. Geach, the\r\nindigenous vegetation of Timor is poor and monotonous. The lower ranges\r\nof the hills are everywhere covered with scrubby Eucalypti, which only\r\noccasionally grow into lofty forest trees. Mingled with these in smaller\r\nquantities are acacias and the fragrant sandalwood, while the higher\r\nmountains, which rise to about six or seven thousand feet, are either\r\ncovered with coarse grass or are altogether barren. In the lower\r\ngrounds are a variety of weedy bushes, and open waste places are covered\r\neverywhere with a nettle-like wild mint. Here is found the beautiful\r\ncrown lily, Gloriosa superba, winding among the bushes, and displaying\r\nits magnificent blossoms in great profusion. A wild vine also occurs,\r\nbearing great irregular bunches of hairy grapes of a coarse but very\r\nluscious flavour. In some of the valleys where the vegetation is richer,\r\nthorny shrubs and climbers are so abundant as to make the thickets quite\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nThe soil seems very poor, consisting chiefly of decomposing clayey\r\nshales; and the bare earth and rock is almost everywhere visible. The\r\ndrought of the hot season is so severe that most of the streams dry up\r\nin the plains before they reach the sea; everything becomes burned up,\r\nand the leaves of the larger trees fall as completely as in our winter.\r\nOn the mountains from two to four thousand feet elevation there is a\r\nmuch moister atmosphere, so that potatoes and other European products\r\ncan be grown all the year round. Besides ponies, almost the only exports\r\nof Timor are sandalwood and beeswax. The sandalwood (Santalum sp.) is\r\nthe produce of a small tree, which grows sparingly in the mountains of\r\nTimor and many of the other islands in the far East. The wood is of\r\na fine yellow colour, and possesses a well-known delightful fragrance\r\nwhich is wonderfully permanent. It is brought down to Delli in small\r\nlogs, and is chiefly exported to China, where it is largely used to burn\r\nin the temples, and in the houses of the wealthy.\r\n\r\nThe beeswax is a still more important and valuable product, formed by\r\nthe wild bees (Apis dorsata), which build huge honeycombs, suspended\r\nin the open air from the underside of the lofty branches of the highest\r\ntrees. These are of a semicircular form, and often three or four feet\r\nin diameter. I once saw the natives take a bees' nest, and a very\r\ninteresting sight it was. In the valley where I used to collect insects,\r\nI one day saw three or four Timorese men and boys under a high tree,\r\nand, looking up, saw on a very lofty horizontal branch three large bees'\r\ncombs. The tree was straight and smooth-barked and without a branch,\r\nuntil at seventy or eighty feet from the ground it gave out the limb\r\nwhich the bees had chosen for their home. As the men were evidently\r\nlooking after the bees, I waited to watch their operations. One of them\r\nfirst produced a long piece of wood apparently the stem of a small\r\ntree or creeper, which he had brought with him, and began splitting it\r\nthrough in several directions, which showed that it was very tough\r\nand stringy. He then wrapped it in palm-leaves, which were secured\r\nby twisting a slender creeper round them. He then fastened his cloth\r\ntightly round his loins, and producing another cloth wrapped it around\r\nhis head, neck, and body, and tied it firmly around his neck, leaving\r\nhis face, arms, and legs completely bare. Slung to his girdle he\r\ncarried a long thin coil of cord; and while he had been making these\r\npreparations, one of his companions had cut a strong creeper or\r\nbush-rope eight or ten yards long, to one end of which the wood-torch\r\nwas fastened, and lighted at the bottom, emitting a steady stream of\r\nsmoke. Just above the torch a chopping-knife was fastened by a short\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nThe bee-hunter now took hold of the bush-rope just above the torch and\r\npassed the other end around the trunk of the tree, holding one end in\r\neach hand. Jerking it up the tree a little above his head he set his\r\nfoot against the trunk, and leaning back began walking up it. It was\r\nwonderful to see the skill with which he took advantage of the slightest\r\nirregularities of the bark or obliquity of the stem to aid his ascent,\r\njerking the stiff creeper a few feet higher when he had found a firm\r\nhold for his bare foot. It almost made me giddy to look at him as he\r\nrapidly got up--thirty, forty, fifty feet above the ground; and I kept\r\nwondering how he could possibly mount the next few feet of straight\r\nsmooth trunk. Still, however, he kept on with as much coolness and\r\napparent certainty as if he were going up a ladder, until he got within\r\nten or fifteen feet of the bees. Then he stopped a moment, and took care\r\nto swing the torch (which hung just at his feet) a little towards these\r\ndangerous insects, so as to send up the stream of smoke between him\r\nand them. Still going on, in a minute more he brought himself under\r\nthe limb, and, in a manner quite unintelligible to me, seeing that both\r\nhands were occupied in supporting himself by the creeper, managed to get\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nBy this time the bees began to be alarmed, and formed a dense buzzing\r\nswarm just over him, but he brought the torch up closer to him, and\r\ncoolly brushed away those that settled on his arms or legs. Then\r\nstretching himself along the limb, he crept towards the nearest comb\r\nand swung the torch just under it. The moment the smoke touched it, its\r\ncolour changed in a most curious manner from black to white, the myriads\r\nof bees that had covered it flying off and forming a dense cloud above\r\nand around. The man then lay at full length along the limb, and brushed\r\noff the remaining bees with his hand, and then drawing his knife cut off\r\nthe comb at one slice close to the tree, and attaching the thin cord to\r\nit, let it down to his companions below. He was all this time enveloped\r\nin a crowd of angry bees, and how he bore their stings so coolly, and\r\nwent on with his work at that giddy height so deliberately, was more\r\nthan I could understand. The bees were evidently not stupified by the\r\nsmoke or driven away far by it, and it was impossible that the small\r\nstream from the torch could protect his whole body when at work. There\r\nwere three other combs on the same tree, and all were successively\r\ntaken, and furnished the whole party with a luscious feast of honey and\r\nyoung bees, as well as a valuable lot of wax.\r\n\r\nAfter two of the combs had been let down, the bees became rather\r\nnumerous below, flying about wildly and stinging viciously. Several got\r\nabout me, and I was soon stung, and had to run away, beating them off\r\nwith my net and capturing them for specimens. Several of them followed\r\nme for at least half a mile, getting into my hair and persecuting me\r\nmost pertinaciously, so that I was more astonished than ever at the\r\nimmunity of the natives. I am inclined to think that slow and deliberate\r\nmotion, and no attempt at escape, are perhaps the best safeguards. A bee\r\nsettling on a passive native probably behaves as it would on a tree or\r\nother inanimate substance, which it does not attempt to sting. Still\r\nthey must often suffer, but they are used to the pain and learn to bear\r\nit impassively, as without doing so no man could be a bee-hunter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE TIMOR GROUP.\r\n\r\nIF we look at a map of the Archipelago, nothing seems more unlikely than\r\nthat the closely connected chain of islands from Java to Timor should\r\ndiffer materially in their natural productions. There are, it is true,\r\ncertain differences of climate and of physical geography, but these\r\ndo not correspond with the division the naturalist is obliged to make.\r\nBetween the two ends of the chain there is a great contrast of climate,\r\nthe west being exceedingly moist and leaving only a short and irregular\r\ndry season, the east being as dry and parched up, and having but a short\r\nwet season. This change, however, occurs about the middle of Java, the\r\neastern portion of that island having as strongly marked seasons as\r\nLombock and Timor. There is also a difference in physical geography; but\r\nthis occurs at the eastern termination of the chain where the volcanoes\r\nwhich are the marked feature of Java, Bali, Lombock, Sumbawa, and\r\nFlores, turn northwards through Gunong Api to Banda, leaving Timor with\r\nonly one volcanic peak near its centre, while the main portion of the\r\nisland consists of old sedimentary rocks. Neither of these physical\r\ndifferences corresponds with the remarkable change in natural\r\nproductions which occurs at the Straits of Lombock, separating the\r\nisland of that name from Bali, and which is at once so large in amount\r\nand of so fundamental a character, as to form an important feature in\r\nthe zoological geography of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch naturalist Zollinger, who resided a long time on the island of\r\nBali, informs us that its productions completely assimilate with those\r\nof Java, and that he is not aware of a single animal found in it which\r\ndoes not inhabit the larger island. During the few days which I stayed\r\non the north coast of Bali on my way to Lombock, I saw several birds\r\nhighly characteristic of Javan ornithology. Among these were the\r\nyellow-headed weaver (Ploceus hypoxantha), the black grasshopper thrush\r\n(Copsychus amoenus), the rosy barbet (Megalaema rosea), the Malay oriole\r\n(Oriolus horsfieldi), the Java ground starling (Sturnopastor jalla), and\r\nthe Javanese three-toed woodpecker (Chrysonotus tiga). On crossing over\r\nto Lombock, separated from Bali by a strait less than twenty miles wide,\r\nI naturally expected to meet with some of these birds again; but during\r\na stay there of three months I never saw one of them, but found a\r\ntotally different set of species, most of which were utterly unknown\r\nnot only in Java, but also in Borneo, Sumatra, and Malacca. For example,\r\namong the commonest birds in Lombock were white cockatoos and three\r\nspecies of Meliphagidae or honeysuckers, belonging to family groups\r\nwhich are entirely absent from the western or Indo-Malayan region of the\r\nArchipelago. On passing to Flores and Timor the distinctness from the\r\nJavanese productions increases, and we find that these islands form a\r\nnatural group, whose birds are related to those of Java and Australia,\r\nbut are quite distinct from either. Besides my own collections in\r\nLombock and Timor, my assistant Mr. Allen made a good collection in\r\nFlores; and these, with a few species obtained by the Dutch naturalists,\r\nenable us to form a very good idea of the natural history of this group\r\nof islands, and to derive therefrom some very interesting results.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds known from these islands up to this date is: 63 from\r\nLombock, 86 from Flores, and 118 from Timor; and from the whole group,\r\n188 species. With the exception of two or three species which appear\r\nto have been derived from the Moluccas, all these birds can be traced,\r\neither directly or by close allies, to Java on the one side or to\r\nAustralia on the other; although no less than 82 of them are found\r\nnowhere out of this small group of islands. There is not, however,\r\na single genus peculiar to the group, or even one which is largely\r\nrepresented in it by peculiar species; and this is a fact which\r\nindicates that the fauna is strictly derivative, and that its origin\r\ndoes not go back beyond one of the most recent geological epochs. Of\r\ncourse there are a large number of species (such as most of the waders,\r\nmany of the raptorial birds, some of the kingfishers, swallows, and a\r\nfew others), which range so widely over a large part of the Archipelago\r\nthat it is impossible to trace them as having come from any one part\r\nrather than from another. There are fifty-seven such species in my list,\r\nand besides these there are thirty-five more which, though peculiar to\r\nthe Timor group, are yet allied to wide-ranging forms. Deducting these\r\nninety-two species, we have nearly a hundred birds left whose relations\r\nwith those of other countries we will now consider.\r\n\r\nIf we first take those species which, as far as we yet know, are\r\nabsolutely confined to each island, we find, in:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lombock 4 belonging to 2 genera, of which 1 is Australian, 1 Indian.\r\n  Flores 12       \"      7        \"         5 are    \"       2    \"\r\n  Timor  42       \"      20       \"        16 are    \"       4    \"\r\n\r\nThe actual number of peculiar species in each island I do not suppose\r\nto be at all accurately determined, since the rapidly increasing numbers\r\nevidently depend upon the more extensive collections made in Timor than\r\nin Flores, and in Flores than in Lombock; but what we can depend more\r\nupon, and what is of more special interest, is the greatly increased\r\nproportion of Australian forms and decreased proportion of Indian forms,\r\nas we go from west to east. We shall show this in a yet more striking\r\nmanner by counting the number of species identical with those of Java\r\nand Australia respectively in each island, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      In Lombock.     In Flores.    In Timor.\r\n     Javan birds... . 33             23            11\r\n     Australian birds..  4              5            10\r\n\r\nHere we see plainly the course of the migration which has been going on\r\nfor hundreds or thousands of years, and is still going on at the present\r\nday. Birds entering from Java are most numerous in the island nearest\r\nJava; each strait of the sea to be crossed to reach another island\r\noffers an obstacle, and thus a smaller number get over to the next\r\nisland. [The names of all the birds inhabiting these islands are to be\r\nfound in the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London\" for the\r\nyear 1863.] It will be observed that the number of birds that appear to\r\nhave entered from Australia is much less than those which have come from\r\nJava; and we may at first sight suppose that this is due to the wide sea\r\nthat separates Australia from Timor. But this would be a hasty and,\r\nas we shall soon see, an unwarranted supposition. Besides these birds\r\nidentical with species inhabiting Java and Australia, there are a\r\nconsiderable number of others very closely allied to species peculiar to\r\nthose countries, and we must take these also into account before we form\r\nany conclusion on the matter. It will be as well to combine these with\r\nthe former table thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       In Lombock.  In Flores.  In Timor.\r\n        Javan birds........  ...           33           23         11\r\n        Closely allied to Javan birds..     1            5          6\r\n        Total..............                34           28         17\r\n\r\n        Australian birds.........           4            5         10\r\n        Closely allied to Australian birds  3            9         26\r\n        Total..... .........                7           14         36\r\n\r\nWe now see that the total number of birds which seem to have been\r\nderived from Java and Australia is very nearly equal, but there is this\r\nremarkable difference between the two series: that whereas the larger\r\nproportion by far of the Java set are identical with those still\r\ninhabiting that country, an almost equally large proportion of the\r\nAustralian set are distinct, though often very closely allied species.\r\nIt is to be observed also, that these representative or allied species\r\ndiminish in number as they recede from Australia, while they increase\r\nin number as they recede from Java. There are two reasons for this, one\r\nbeing that the islands decrease rapidly in size from Timor to Lombock,\r\nand can therefore support a decreasing number of species; the other and\r\nthe more important is, that the distance of Australia from Timor cuts\r\noff the supply of fresh immigrants, and has thus allowed variation\r\nto have full play; while the vicinity of Lombock to Bali and Java has\r\nallowed a continual influx of fresh individuals which, by crossing with\r\nthe earlier immigrants, has checked variation.\r\n\r\nTo simplify our view of the derivative origin of the birds of these\r\nislands let us treat them as a whole, and thus perhaps render more\r\nintelligible their respective relations to Java and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Timor group of islands contains:\r\n\r\nJavan birds....... 36 Australian birds... 13 Closely allied species..\r\n11 Closely allied species.. 35 Derived from Java .... 47 Derived from\r\nAustralia... 48\r\n\r\nWe have here a wonderful agreement in the number of birds belonging\r\nto Australian and Javanese groups, but they are divided in exactly a\r\nreverse manner, three-fourths of the Javan birds being identical species\r\nand one-fourth representatives, while only one-fourth of the Australian\r\nforms are identical and three-fourths representatives. This is the most\r\nimportant fact which we can elicit from a study of the birds of these\r\nislands, since it gives us a very complete clue to much of their past\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nChange of species is a slow process--on that we are all agreed, though\r\nwe may differ about how it has taken place. The fact that the Australian\r\nspecies in these islands have mostly changed, while the Javan species\r\nhave almost all remained unchanged, would therefore indicate that the\r\ndistrict was first peopled from Australia. But, for this to have been\r\nthe case, the physical conditions must have been very different from\r\nwhat they are now. Nearly three hundred miles of open sea now separate\r\nAustralia from Timor, which island is connected with Java by a chain of\r\nbroken land divided by straits which are nowhere more than about twenty\r\nmiles wide. Evidently there are now great facilities for the natural\r\nproductions of Java to spread over and occupy the whole of these\r\nislands, while those of Australia would find very great difficulty in\r\ngetting across. To account for the present state of things, we should\r\nnaturally suppose that Australia was once much more closely connected\r\nwith Timor than it is at present; and that this was the case is rendered\r\nhighly probable by the fact of a submarine bank extending along all the\r\nnorth and west coast of Australia, and at one place approaching within\r\ntwenty miles of the coast of Timor. This indicates a recent subsidence\r\nof North Australia, which probably once extended as far as the edge\r\nof this bank, between which and Timor there is an unfathomed depth of\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Timor was ever actually connected with Australia,\r\nbecause such a large number of very abundant and characteristic groups\r\nof Australian birds are quite absent, and not a single Australian mammal\r\nhas entered Timor--which would certainly not have been the case had\r\nthe lands been actually united. Such groups as the bower birds\r\n(Ptilonorhynchus), the black and red cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus),\r\nthe blue wrens (Malurus), the crowshrikes (Cracticus), the Australian\r\nshrikes (Falcunculus and Colluricincla), and many others, which abound\r\nall over Australia, would certainly have spread into Timor if it\r\nhad been united to that country, or even if for any long time it had\r\napproached nearer to it than twenty miles. Neither do any of the most\r\ncharacteristic groups of Australian insects occur in Timor; so that\r\neverything combines to indicate that a strait of the sea has always\r\nseparated it from Australia, but that at one period this strait was\r\nreduced to a width of about twenty miles.\r\n\r\nBut at the time when this narrowing of the sea took place in one\r\ndirection, there must have been a greater separation at the other end of\r\nthe chain, or we should find more equality in the numbers of identical\r\nand representative species derived from each extremity. It is true that\r\nthe widening of the strait at the Australian end by subsidence, would,\r\nby putting a stop to immigration and intercrossing of individuals from\r\nthe mother country, have allowed full scope to the causes which have\r\nled to the modification of the species; while the continued stream of\r\nimmigrants from Java, would, by continual intercrossing, check such\r\nmodification. This view will not, however, explain all the facts; for\r\nthe character of the fauna of the Timorese group is indicated as well by\r\nthe forms which are absent from it as by those which it contains, and is\r\nby this kind of evidence shown to be much more Australian than Indian.\r\nNo less than twenty-nine genera, all more or less abundant in Java, and\r\nmost of which range over a wide area, are altogether absent; while of\r\nthe equally diffused Australian genera only about fourteen are wanting.\r\nThis would clearly indicate that there has been, until recently, a wide\r\nseparation from Java; and the fact that the islands of Bali and Lombock\r\nare small, and are almost wholly volcanic, and contain a smaller number\r\nof modified forms than the other islands, would point them out as of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. A wide arm of the sea probably occupied\r\ntheir place at the time when Timor was in the closest proximity to\r\nAustralia; and as the subterranean fires were slowly piling up the now\r\nfertile islands of Bali and Lombock, the northern shores of Australia\r\nwould be sinking beneath the ocean. Some such changes as have been here\r\nindicated, enable us to understand how it happens, that though the birds\r\nof this group are on the whole almost as much Indian as Australian, yet\r\nthe species which are peculiar to the group are mostly Australian in\r\ncharacter; and also why such a large number of common Indian forms\r\nwhich extend through Java to Bali, should not have transmitted a single\r\nrepresentative to the island further east.\r\n\r\nThe Mammalia of Timor as well as those of the other islands of the\r\ngroup are exceedingly scanty, with the exception of bats. These last are\r\ntolerably abundant, and no doubt many more remain to be discovered. Out\r\nof fifteen species known from Timor, nine are found also in Java, or the\r\nislands west of it; three are Moluccan species, most of which are also\r\nfound in Australia, and the rest are peculiar to Timor.\r\n\r\nThe land mammals are only seven in number, as follows: 1. The common\r\nmonkey, Macacus cynomolgus, which is found in all the Indo-Malayan\r\nislands, and has spread from Java through Bali and Lombock to Timor.\r\nThis species is very frequent on the banks of rivers, and may have\r\nbeen conveyed from island to island on trees carried down by floods. 2.\r\nParadoxurus fasciatus; a civet cat, very common over a large part of\r\nthe Archipelago. 3. Felis megalotis; a tiger cat, said to be peculiar\r\nto Timor, where it exists only in the interior, and is very rare. Its\r\nnearest allies are in Java. 4. Cervus timoriensis; a deer, closely\r\nallied to the Javan and Moluccan species, if distinct. 5. A wild pig,\r\nSus timoriensis; perhaps the same as some of the Moluccan species. 6.\r\nA shrew mouse, Sorex tenuis; supposed to be peculiar to Timor. 7. An\r\nEastern opossum, Cuscus orientalis; found also in the Moluccas, if not a\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nThe fact that not one of these species is Australian or nearly allied to\r\nany Australian form, is strongly corroborative of the opinion that Timor\r\nhas never formed a part of that country; as in that case some kangaroo\r\nor other marsupial animal would almost certainly be found there. It is\r\nno doubt very difficult to account for the presence of some of the few\r\nmammals that do exist in Timor, especially the tiger cat and the deer.\r\nWe must consider, however, that during thousands, and perhaps hundreds\r\nof thousands of years, these islands and the seas between them have\r\nbeen subjected to volcanic action. The land has been raised and has sunk\r\nagain; the straits have been narrowed or widened; many of the islands\r\nmay have been joined and dissevered again; violent floods have again and\r\nagain devastated the mountains and plains, carrying out to sea hundreds\r\nof forest trees, as has often happened during volcanic eruptions in\r\nJava; and it does not seem improbable that once in a thousand, or ten\r\nthousand years, there should have occurred such a favourable combination\r\nof circumstances as would lead to the migration of two or three land\r\nanimals from one island to another. This is all that we need ask to\r\naccount for the very scanty and fragmentary group of Mammalia which now\r\ninhabit the large island of Timor. The deer may very probably have been\r\nintroduced by man, for the Malays often keep tame fawns; and it may\r\nnot require a thousand, or even five hundred years, to establish new\r\ncharacters in an animal removed to a country so different in climate and\r\nvegetation as is Timor from the Moluccas. I have not mentioned horses,\r\nwhich are often thought to be wild in Timor, because there are no\r\ngrounds whatever for such a belief. The Timor ponies have every one an\r\nowner, and are quite as much domesticated animals as the cattle on a\r\nSouth American hacienda.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length upon the origin of the Timorese fauna\r\nbecause it appears to be a most interesting and instructive problem. It\r\nis very seldom that we can trace the animals of a district so clearly as\r\nwe can in this case to two definite sources, and still more rarely that\r\nthey furnish such decisive evidence of the time, the manner, and the\r\nproportions of their introduction. We have here a group of Oceanic\r\nIslands in miniature--islands which have never formed part of the\r\nadjacent lands, although so closely approaching them; and their\r\nproductions have the characteristics of true Oceanic Islands slightly\r\nmodified. These characteristics are: the absence all Mammalia except\r\nbats; and the occurrence of peculiar species of birds, insects, and land\r\nshells, which, though found nowhere else, are plainly related to those\r\nof the nearest land. Thus, we have an entire absence of all Australian\r\nmammals, and the presence of only a few stragglers from the west which\r\ncan be accounted for in the manner already indicated. Bats are tolerably\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nBirds have many peculiar species, with a decided relationship to those\r\nof the two nearest masses of land. The insects have similar relations\r\nwith the birds. As an example, four species of the Papilionidae are\r\npeculiar to Timor, three others are also found in Java, and one in\r\nAustralia. Of the four peculiar species two are decided modifications\r\nof Javanese forms, while the others seem allied to those of the Moluccas\r\nand Celebes. The very few land shells known are all, curiously enough,\r\nallied to or identical with Moluccan or Celebes forms. The Pieridae\r\n(white and yellow butterflies) which wander more, and from frequenting\r\nopen grounds, are more liable to be blown out to sea, seem about equally\r\nrelated to those of Java, Australia, and the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to in Mr. Darwin's theory, of Oceanic Islands\r\nhaving never been connected with the mainland, that this would imply\r\nthat their animal population was a matter of chance; it has been termed\r\nthe \"flotsam and jetsam theory,\" and it has been maintained that nature\r\ndoes not work by the \"CHAPTER of accidents.\" But in the case which I\r\nhave here described, we have the most positive evidence that such has\r\nbeen the mode of peopling the islands. Their productions are of that\r\nmiscellaneous character which we should expect from such an origin; and\r\nto suppose that they have been portions of Australia or of Java will\r\nintroduce perfectly gratuitous difficulties, and render it quite\r\nimpossible to explain those curious relations which the best known group\r\nof animals (the birds) have been shown to exhibit. On the other hand,\r\nthe depth of the surrounding seas, the form of the submerged banks,\r\nand the volcanic character of most of the islands, all point to an\r\nindependent origin.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I must make one remark to avoid misapprehension. When\r\nI say that Timor has never formed part of Australia, I refer only to\r\nrecent geological epochs. In Secondary or even Eocene or Miocene times,\r\nTimor and Australia may have been connected; but if so, all record of\r\nsuch a union has been lost by subsequent submergence, and in accounting\r\nfor the present land-inhabitants of any country we have only to consider\r\nthose changes which have occurred since its last elevation above the\r\nwaters. Since such last elevation, I feel confident that Timor has not\r\nformed part of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. CELEBES.\r\n\r\n (MACASSAR, SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER, 1856.)\r\n\r\nI LEFT Lombock on the 30th of August, and reached Macassar in three\r\ndays. It was with great satisfaction that I stepped on a shore which I\r\nhad been vainly trying to reach since February, and where I expected to\r\nmeet with so much that was new and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe coast of this part of Celebes is low and flat, lined with trees and\r\nvillages so as to conceal the interior, except at occasional openings\r\nwhich show a wide extent of bare and marshy rice-fields. A few hills\r\nof no great height were visible in the background; but owing to the\r\nperpetual haze over the land at this time of the year, I could nowhere\r\ndiscern the high central range of the peninsula, or the celebrated peak\r\nof Bontyne at its southern extremity. In the roadstead of Macassar there\r\nwas a fine 42-gun frigate, the guardship of the place, as well as a\r\nsmall war steamer and three or four little cutters used for cruising\r\nafter the pirates which infest these seas. There were also a few\r\nsquare-rigged trading-vessels, and twenty or thirty native praus of\r\nvarious sizes. I brought letters of introduction to a Dutch gentleman,\r\nMr. Mesman, and also to a Danish shopkeeper, who could both speak\r\nEnglish and who promised to assist me in finding a place to stay,\r\nsuitable for my pursuits. In the meantime, I went to a kind of\r\nclubhouse, in default of any hotel in the place.\r\n\r\nMacassar was the first Dutch town I had visited, and I found it prettier\r\nand cleaner than any I had yet seen in the East. The Dutch have some\r\nadmirable local regulations. All European houses must be kept well\r\nwhite-washed, and every person must, at four in the afternoon, water the\r\nroad in front of his house. The streets are kept clear of refuse, and\r\ncovered drains carry away all impurities into large open sewers, into\r\nwhich the tide is admitted at high-water and allowed to flow out when\r\nit has ebbed, carrying all the sewage with it into the sea. The town\r\nconsists chiefly of one long narrow street along the seaside, devoted to\r\nbusiness, and principally occupied by the Dutch and Chinese merchants'\r\noffices and warehouses, and the native shops or bazaars. This extends\r\nnorthwards for more than a mile, gradually merging into native\r\nhouses often of a most miserable description, but made to have a neat\r\nappearance by being all built up exactly to the straight line of the\r\nstreet, and being generally backed by fruit trees. This street is\r\nusually thronged with a native population of Bugis and Macassar men, who\r\nwear cotton trousers about twelve inches long, covering only from the\r\nhip to half-way down the thigh, and the universal Malay sarong, of gay\r\nchecked colours, worn around the waist or across the shoulders in a\r\nvariety of ways. Parallel to this street run two short ones which form\r\nthe old Dutch town, and are enclosed by gates. These consist of private\r\nhouses, and at their southern end is the fort, the church, and a road at\r\nright angles to the beach, containing the houses of the Governor and\r\nof the principal officials. Beyond the fort, again along the beach,\r\nis another long street of native huts and many country-houses of the\r\ntradesmen and merchants. All around extend the flat rice-fields, now\r\nbare and dry and forbidding, covered with dusty stubble and weeds. A few\r\nmonths back these were a mass of verdure, and their barren appearance\r\nat this season offered a striking contrast to the perpetual crops on the\r\nsame kind of country in Lombock and Bali, where the seasons are exactly\r\nsimilar, but where an elaborate system of irrigation produces the effect\r\nof a perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival I paid a visit of ceremony to the Governor,\r\naccompanied by my friend the Danish merchant, who spoke excellent\r\nEnglish. His Excellency was very polite, and offered me every facility\r\nfor travelling about the country and prosecuting my researches in\r\nnatural history. We conversed in French, which all Dutch officials speak\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nFinding it very inconvenient and expensive to stay in the town, I\r\nremoved at the end of a week to a little bamboo house, kindly offered me\r\nby Mr. Mesman. It was situated about two miles away, on a small coffee\r\nplantation and farm, and about a mile beyond Mr. M.'s own country-house.\r\nIt consisted of two rooms raised about seven feet above the ground, the\r\nlower part being partly open (and serving excellently to skin birds in)\r\nand partly used as a granary for rice. There was a kitchen and other\r\nouthouses, and several cottages nearby, occupied by men in Mr. M.'s\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\nAfter being settled a few days in my new house, I found that no\r\ncollections could be made without going much further into the country.\r\nThe rice-fields for some miles around resembled English stubbles late\r\nin autumn, and were almost as unproductive of bird or insect life. There\r\nwere several native villages scattered about, so embosomed in fruit\r\ntrees that at a distance they looked like clumps or patches of forest.\r\nThese were my only collecting places; but they produced a very limited\r\nnumber of species, and were soon exhausted. Before I could move to any\r\nmore promising district it was necessary to obtain permission from the\r\nRajah of Goa, whose territories approach to within two miles of the town\r\nof Macassar. I therefore presented myself at the Governor's office and\r\nrequested a letter to the Rajah, to claim his protection, and permission\r\nto travel in his territories whenever I might wish to do so. This was\r\nimmediately granted, and a special messenger was sent with me to carry\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. Mesman kindly lent me a horse, and accompanied me on my\r\nvisit to the Rajah, with whom he was great friends. We found his Majesty\r\nseated out of doors, watching the erection of a new house. He was naked\r\nfrom the waist up, wearing only the usual short trousers and sarong.\r\nTwo chairs were brought out for us, but all the chiefs and other natives\r\nwere seated on the ground. The messenger, squatting down at the Rajah's\r\nfeet, produced the letter, which was sewn up in a covering of yellow\r\nsilk. It was handed to one of the chief officers, who ripped it open and\r\nreturned it to the Rajah, who read it, and then showed it to Mr. M., who\r\nboth speaks and reads the Macassar language fluently, and who explained\r\nfully what I required. Permission was immediately granted me to go where\r\nI liked in the territories of Goa, but the Rajah desired, that should I\r\nwish to stay any time at a place I would first give him notice, in order\r\nthat he might send someone to see that no injury was done me. Some wine\r\nwas then brought us, and afterwards some detestable coffee and wretched\r\nsweetmeats, for it is a fact that I have never tasted good coffee where\r\npeople grow it themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was the height of the dry season, and there was a fine\r\nwind all day, it was by no means a healthy time of year. My boy Ali had\r\nhardly been a day on shore when he was attacked by fever, which put me\r\nto great inconvenience, as at the house where I was staying, nothing\r\ncould be obtained but at mealtime. After having cured Ali, and with much\r\ndifficulty got another servant to cook for me, I was no sooner settled\r\nat my country abode than the latter was attacked with the same disease;\r\nand, having a wife in the town, left me. Hardly was he gone than I fell\r\nill myself with strong intermittent fever every other day. In about a\r\nweek I got over it, by a liberal use of quinine, when scarcely was I on\r\nmy legs than Ali again became worse than ever. Ali's fever attacked him\r\ndaily, but early in the morning he was pretty well, and then managed\r\nto cook enough for me for the day. In a week I cured him, and also\r\nsucceeded in getting another boy who could cook and shoot, and had no\r\nobjection to go into the interior. His name was Baderoon, and as he\r\nwas unmarried and had been used to a roving life, having been several\r\nvoyages to North Australia to catch trepang or \"beche de mer\", I was in\r\nhopes of being able to keep him. I also got hold of a little impudent\r\nrascal of twelve or fourteen, who could speak some Malay, to carry my\r\ngun or insect-net and make himself generally useful. Ali had by this\r\ntime become a pretty good bird-skinner, so that I was fairly supplied\r\nwith servants.\r\n\r\nI made many excursions into the country, in search of a good station for\r\ncollecting birds and insects. Some of the villages a few miles inland\r\nare scattered about in woody ground which has once been virgin forest,\r\nbut of which the constituent trees have been for the most part replaced\r\nby fruit trees, and particularly by the large palm, Arenga saccharifera,\r\nfrom which wine and sugar are made, and which also produces a coarse\r\nblack fibre used for cordage. That necessary of life, the bamboo, has\r\nalso been abundantly planted. In such places I found a good many birds,\r\namong which were the fine cream-coloured pigeon, Carpophaga luctuosa,\r\nand the rare blue-headed roller, Coracias temmincki, which has a most\r\ndiscordant voice, and generally goes in pairs, flying from tree to tree,\r\nand exhibiting while at rest that all-in-a-heap appearance and jerking\r\nmotion of the head and tail which are so characteristic of the great\r\nFissirostral group to which it belongs. From this habit alone,\r\nthe kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, trogons, and South American\r\npuff-birds, might be grouped together by a person who had observed them\r\nin a state of nature, but who had never had an opportunity of examining\r\ntheir form and structure in detail. Thousands of crows, rather smaller\r\nthan our rook, keep up a constant cawing in these plantations; the\r\ncurious wood-swallows (Artami), which closely resemble swallows in their\r\nhabits and flight but differ much in form and structure, twitter from\r\nthe tree-tops; while a lyre-tailed drongo-shrike, with brilliant black\r\nplumage and milk-white eyes, continually deceives the naturalist by the\r\nvariety of its unmelodious notes.\r\n\r\nIn the more shady parts butterflies were tolerably abundant; the most\r\ncommon being species of Euplaea and Danais, which frequent gardens\r\nand shrubberies, and owing to their weak flight are easily captured. A\r\nbeautiful pale blue and black butterfly, which flutters along near the\r\nground among the thickets, and settles occasionally upon flowers, was\r\none of the most striking; and scarcely less so, was one with a rich\r\norange band on a blackish ground--these both belong to the Pieridae, the\r\ngroup that contains our common white butterflies, although differing\r\nso much from them in appearance. Both were quite new to European\r\nnaturalists. [The former has been named Eronia tritaea; the latter\r\nTachyris ithonae.] Now and then I extended my walks some miles further,\r\nto the only patch of true forest I could find, accompanied by my two\r\nboys with guns and insect-net. We used to start early, taking our\r\nbreakfast with us, and eating it wherever we could find shade and water.\r\nAt such times my Macassar boys would put a minute fragment of rice and\r\nmeat or fish on a leaf, and lay it on a stone or stump as an offering to\r\nthe deity of the spot; for though nominal Mahometans the Macassar people\r\nretain many pagan superstitions, and are but lax in their religious\r\nobservances. Pork, it is true, they hold in abhorrence, but will\r\nnot refuse wine when offered them, and consume immense quantities of\r\n\"sagueir,\" or palm-wine, which is about as intoxicating as ordinary beer\r\nor cider. When well made it is a very refreshing drink, and we often\r\ntook a draught at some of the little sheds dignified by the name of\r\nbazaars, which are scattered about the country wherever there is any\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Mesman told me of a larger piece of forest where he\r\nsometimes went to shoot deer, but he assured me it was much further off,\r\nand that there were no birds. However, I resolved to explore it, and the\r\nnext morning at five o'clock we started, carrying our breakfast and some\r\nother provisions with us, and intending to stay the night at a house on\r\nthe borders of the wood. To my surprise two hours' hard walking brought\r\nus to this house, where we obtained permission to pass the night. We\r\nthen walked on, Ali and Baderoon with a gun each, Baso carrying\r\nour provisions and my insect-box, while I took only my net and\r\ncollecting-bottle and determined to devote myself wholly to the insects.\r\nScarcely had I entered the forest when I found some beautiful little\r\ngreen and gold speckled weevils allied to the genus Pachyrhynchus, a\r\ngroup which is almost confined to the Philippine Islands, and is quite\r\nunknown in Borneo, Java, or Malacca. The road was shady and apparently\r\nmuch trodden by horses and cattle, and I quickly obtained some\r\nbutterflies I had not before met with. Soon a couple of reports were\r\nheard, and coming up to my boys I found they had shot two specimens of\r\none of the finest of known cuckoos, Phoenicophaus callirhynchus. This\r\nbird derives its name from its large bill being coloured of a brilliant\r\nyellow, red, and black, in about equal proportions. The tail is\r\nexceedingly long, and of a fine metallic purple, while the plumage of\r\nthe body is light coffee brown. It is one of the characteristic birds of\r\nthe island of Celebes, to which it is confined.\r\n\r\nAfter sauntering along for a couple of hours we reached a small river,\r\nso deep that horses could only cross it by swimming, so we had to\r\nturn back; but as we were getting hungry, and the water of the almost\r\nstagnant river was too muddy to drink, we went towards a house a few\r\nhundred yards off. In the plantation we saw a small raised hut, which\r\nwe thought would do well for us to breakfast in, so I entered, and found\r\ninside a young woman with an infant. She handed me a jug of water, but\r\nlooked very much frightened. However, I sat down on the doorstep, and\r\nasked for the provisions. In handing them up, Baderoon saw the infant,\r\nand started back as if he had seen a serpent. It then immediately struck\r\nme that this was a hut in which, as among the Dyaks of Borneo and many\r\nother savage tribes, the women are secluded for some time after the\r\nbirth of their child, and that we did very wrong to enter it; so we\r\nwalked off and asked permission to eat our breakfast in the family\r\nmansion close at hand, which was of course granted. While I ate, three\r\nmen, two women, and four children watched every motion, and never took\r\neyes off me until I had finished.\r\n\r\nOn our way back in the heat of the day, I had the good fortune to\r\ncapture three specimens of a fine Ornithoptera, the largest, the\r\nmost perfect, and the most beautiful of butterflies. I trembled with\r\nexcitement as I took the first out of my net and found it to be in\r\nperfect condition. The ground colour of this superb insect was a rich\r\nshining bronzy black, the lower wings delicately grained with white, and\r\nbordered by a row of large spots of the most brilliant satiny yellow.\r\nThe body was marked with shaded spots of white, yellow, and fiery\r\norange, while the head and thorax were intense black. On the under-side\r\nthe lower wings were satiny white, with the marginal spots half black\r\nand half yellow. I gazed upon my prize with extreme interest, as I at\r\nfirst thought it was quite a new species. It proved however to be a\r\nvariety of Ornithoptera remus, one of the rarest and most remarkable\r\nspecies of this highly esteemed group. I also obtained several other\r\nnew and pretty butterflies. When we arrived at our lodging-house, being\r\nparticularly anxious about my insect treasures, I suspended the box\r\nfrom a bamboo on which I could detect no sign of ants, and then began\r\nskinning some of my birds. During my work I often glanced at my precious\r\nbox to see that no intruders had arrived, until after a longer spell of\r\nwork than usual I looked again, and saw to my horror that a column of\r\nsmall red ants were descending the string and entering the box. They\r\nwere already busy at work at the bodies of my treasures, and another\r\nhalf-hour would have seen my whole day's collection destroyed. As it\r\nwas, I had to take every insect out, clean them thoroughly as well as\r\nthe box, and then seek a place of safety for them. As the only effectual\r\none, I begged a plate and a basin from my host, filled the former with\r\nwater, and standing the latter in it placed my box on the top, and then\r\nfelt secure for the night; a few inches of clean water or oil being the\r\nonly barrier these terrible pests are not able to pass.\r\n\r\nOn returning home to Mamajam (as my house was called) I had a slight\r\nreturn of intermittent fever, which kept me some days indoors. As soon\r\nas I was well, I again went to Goa, accompanied by Mr. Mesman, to beg\r\nthe Rajah's assistance in getting a small house built for me near the\r\nforest. We found him at a cock-fight in a shed near his palace, which\r\nhowever, he immediately left to receive us, and walked with us up an\r\ninclined plane of boards which serves for stairs to his house. This was\r\nlarge, well-built, and lofty, with bamboo floor and glass windows. The\r\ngreater part of it seemed to be one large hall divided by the supporting\r\nposts. Near a window sat the Queen, squatting on a rough wooden\r\narm-chair, chewing the everlasting sirih and betel-nut, while a brass\r\nspittoon by her side and a sirih-box in front were ready to administer\r\nto her wants. The Rajah seated himself opposite to her in a similar\r\nchair, and a similar spittoon and sirih-box were held by a little boy\r\nsquatting at his side. Two other chairs were brought for us. Several\r\nyoung women, some the Rajah's daughters, others slaves, were standing\r\nabout; a few were working at frames making sarongs, but most of them\r\nwere idle.\r\n\r\nAnd here I might (if I followed the example of most travellers) launch\r\nout into a glowing description of the charms of these damsels, the\r\nelegant costumes they wore, and the gold and silver ornaments with which\r\nthey were adorned. The jacket or body of purple gauze would figure well\r\nin such a description, allowing the heaving bosom to be seen beneath it,\r\nwhile \"sparkling eyes,\" and \"jetty tresses,\" and \"tiny feet\" might be\r\nthrown in profusely. But, alas! regard for truth will not permit me to\r\nexpatiate too admiringly on such topics, determined as I am to give\r\nas far as I can a true picture of the people and places I visit. The\r\nprincesses were, it is true, sufficiently good-looking, yet neither\r\ntheir persons nor their garments had that appearance of freshness and\r\ncleanliness without which no other charms can be contemplated with\r\npleasure. Everything had a dingy and faded appearance, very disagreeable\r\nand unroyal to a European eye. The only thing that excited some degree\r\nof admiration was the quiet and dignified manner of the Rajah and the\r\ngreat respect always paid to him. None can stand erect in his presence,\r\nand when he sits on a chair, all present (Europeans of course excepted)\r\nsquat upon the ground. The highest seat is literally, with these people,\r\nthe place of honour and the sign of rank. So unbending are the rules in\r\nthis respect, that when an English carriage which the Rajah of Lombock\r\nhad sent for arrived, it was found impossible to use it because the\r\ndriver's seat was the highest, and it had to be kept as a show in its\r\ncoach house. On being told the object of my visit, the Rajah at once\r\nsaid that he would order a house to be emptied for me, which would be\r\nmuch better than building one, as that would take a good deal of time.\r\nBad coffee and sweetmeats were given us as before.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, I called on the Rajah to ask him to send a guide\r\nwith me to show me the house I was to occupy. He immediately ordered a\r\nman to be sent for, gave him instructions, and in a few minutes we\r\nwere on our way. My conductor could speak no Malay, so we walked on in\r\nsilence for an hour, when we turned into a pretty good house and I was\r\nasked to sit down. The head man of the district lived here, and in about\r\nhalf an hour we started again, and another hour's walk brought us to the\r\nvillage and where I was to be lodged. We went to the residence of the\r\nvillage chief, who conversed with my conductor for some time.\r\n\r\nGetting tired, I asked to be shown the house that was prepared for me,\r\nbut the only reply I could get was, \"Wait a little,\" and the parties\r\nwent on talking as before. So I told them I could not wait, as I wanted\r\nto see the house and then to go shooting in the forest. This seemed\r\nto puzzle them, and at length, in answer to questions, very poorly\r\nexplained by one or two bystanders who knew a little Malay, it came out\r\nthat no house was ready, and no one seemed to have the least idea where\r\nto get one. As I did not want to trouble the Rajah any more, I thought\r\nit best to try to frighten them a little; so I told them that if they\r\ndid not immediately find me a house as the Rajah had ordered, I should\r\ngo back and complain to him, but that if a house was found me I would\r\npay for the use of it. This had the desired effect, and one of the head\r\nmen of the village asked me to go with him and look for a house. He\r\nshowed me one or two of the most miserable and ruinous description,\r\nwhich I at once rejected, saying, \"I must have a good one, and near to\r\nthe forest.\" The next he showed me suited very well, so I told him to\r\nsee that it was emptied the next day, for that the day after I should\r\ncome and occupy it.\r\n\r\nOn the day mentioned, as I was not quite ready to go, I sent my two\r\nMacassar boys with brooms to sweep out the house thoroughly. They\r\nreturned in the evening and told me that when they got there the house\r\nwas inhabited, and not a single article removed. However, on hearing\r\nthey had come to clean and take possession, the occupants made a move,\r\nbut with a good deal of grumbling, which made me feel rather uneasy as\r\nto how the people generally might take my intrusion into their village.\r\nThe next morning we took our baggage on three packhorses, and, after a\r\nfew break-downs, arrived about noon at our destination.\r\n\r\nAfter getting all my things set straight, and having made a hasty meal,\r\nI determined if possible to make friends with the people. I therefore\r\nsent for the owner of the house and as many of his acquaintances as\r\nliked to come, to have a \"bitchara,\" or talk. When they were all seated,\r\nI gave them a little tobacco all around, and having my boy Baderoon for\r\ninterpreter, tried to explain to them why I came there; that I was very\r\nsorry to turn them out of the house, but that the Rajah had ordered it\r\nrather than build a new one, which was what I had asked for, and then\r\nplaced five silver rupees in the owner's hand as one month's rent. I\r\nthen assured them that my being there would be a benefit to them, as I\r\nshould buy their eggs and fowls and fruit; and if their children would\r\nbring me shells and insects, of which I showed them specimens, they also\r\nmight earn a good many coppers. After all this had been fully explained\r\nto them, with a long talk and discussion between every sentence, I could\r\nsee that I had made a favourable impression; and that very afternoon, as\r\nif to test my promise to buy even miserable little snail-shells, a dozen\r\nchildren came one after another, bringing me a few specimens each of\r\na small Helix, for which they duly received \"coppers,\" and went away\r\namazed but rejoicing.\r\n\r\nA few days' exploration made me well acquainted with the surrounding\r\ncountry. I was a long way from the road in the forest which I had first\r\nvisited, and for some distance around my house were old clearings and\r\ncottages. I found a few good butterflies, but beetles were very scarce,\r\nand even rotten timber and newly-felled trees (generally so productive)\r\nhere produced scarcely anything. This convinced me that there was not a\r\nsufficient extent of forest in the neighbourhood to make the place worth\r\nstaying at long, but it was too late now to think of going further, as\r\nin about a month the wet season would begin; so I resolved to stay here\r\nand get what was to be had. Unfortunately, after a few days I became ill\r\nwith a low fever which produced excessive lassitude and disinclination\r\nto all exertion. In vain I endeavoured to shake it off; all I could do\r\nwas to stroll quietly each day for an hour about the gardens near, and\r\nto the well, where some good insects were occasionally to be found; and\r\nthe rest of the day to wait quietly at home, and receive what beetles\r\nand shells my little corps of collectors brought me daily. I imputed\r\nmy illness chiefly to the water, which was procured from shallow wells,\r\naround which there was almost always a stagnant puddle in which the\r\nbuffaloes wallowed. Close to my house was an enclosed mudhole where\r\nthree buffaloes were shut up every night, and the effluvia from which\r\nfreely entered through the open bamboo floor. My Malay boy Ali was\r\naffected with the same illness, and as he was my chief bird-skinner I\r\ngot on but slowly with my collections.\r\n\r\nThe occupations and mode of life of the villagers differed but little\r\nfrom those of all other Malay races. The time of the women was almost\r\nwholly occupied in pounding and cleaning rice for daily use, in bringing\r\nhome firewood and water, and in cleaning, dyeing, spinning, and weaving\r\nthe native cotton into sarongs. The weaving is done in the simplest kind\r\nof frame stretched on the floor; and is a very slow and tedious process.\r\nTo form the checked pattern in common use, each patch of coloured\r\nthreads has to be pulled up separately by hand and the shuttle passed\r\nbetween them; so that about an inch a day is the usual progress in stuff\r\na yard and a half wide. The men cultivate a little sirih (the pungent\r\npepper leaf used for chewing with betel-nut) and a few vegetables; and\r\nonce a year rudely plough a small patch of ground with their buffaloes\r\nand plant rice, which then requires little attention until harvest time.\r\nNow and then they have to see to the repairs of their houses, and make\r\nmats, baskets, or other domestic utensils, but a large part of their\r\ntime is passed in idleness.\r\n\r\nNot a single person in the village could speak more than a few words\r\nof Malay, and hardly any of the people appeared to have seen a European\r\nbefore. One most disagreeable result of this was that I excited terror\r\nalike in man and beast. Wherever I went, dogs barked, children screamed,\r\nwomen ran away, and men stared as though I were some strange and\r\nterrible cannibal or monster. Even the pack-horses on the roads and\r\npaths would start aside when I appeared and rush into the jungle; and\r\nas to those horrid, ugly brutes, the buffaloes, they could never be\r\napproached by me; not for fear of my own but of others' safety. They\r\nwould first stick out their necks and stare at me, and then on a\r\nnearer view break loose from their halters or tethers, and rush away\r\nhelter-skelter as if a demon were after them, without any regard for\r\nwhat might be in their way. Whenever I met buffaloes carrying packs\r\nalong a pathway, or being driven home to the village, I had to turn\r\naside into the jungle and hide myself until they had passed, to avoid\r\na catastrophe which would increase the dislike with which I was already\r\nregarded. Everyday about noon the buffaloes were brought into the villa,\r\nand were tethered in the shade around the houses; and then I had to\r\ncreep about like a thief by back ways, for no one could tell what\r\nmischief they might do to children and houses were I to walk among\r\nthem. If I came suddenly upon a well where women were drawing water or\r\nchildren bathing, a sudden flight was the certain result; which things\r\noccurring day after day, were very unpleasant to a person who does not\r\nlike to be disliked, and who had never been accustomed to be treated as\r\nan ogre.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of November, finding my health no better, and insects,\r\nbirds, and shells all very scarce, I determined to return to Mamajam,\r\nand pack up my collections before the heavy rains commenced. The wind\r\nhad already begun to blow from the west, and many signs indicated that\r\nthe rainy season might set in earlier than usual; and then everything\r\nbecomes very damp, and it is almost impossible to dry collections\r\nproperly. My kind friend Mr. Mesman again lent me his pack-horses, and\r\nwith the assistance of a few men to carry my birds and insects, which I\r\ndid not like to trust on horses' backs, we got everything home safe. Few\r\ncan imagine the luxury it was to stretch myself on a sofa, and to take\r\nmy supper comfortably at table seated in my easy bamboo chair, after\r\nhaving for five weeks taken all my meals uncomfortably on the floor.\r\nSuch things are trifles in health, but when the body is weakened by\r\ndisease the habits of a lifetime cannot be so easily set aside.\r\n\r\nMy house, like all bamboo structures in this country, was a leaning one,\r\nthe strong westerly winds of the wet season having set all its posts\r\nout of the perpendicular to such a degree as to make me think it might\r\nsomeday possibly go over altogether. It is a remarkable thing that the\r\nnatives of Celebes have not discovered the use of diagonal struts in\r\nstrengthening buildings. I doubt if there is a native house in the\r\ncountry two years old and at all exposed to the wind, which stands\r\nupright; and no wonder, as they merely consist of posts and joists all\r\nplaced upright or horizontal, and fastened rudely together with rattans.\r\nThey may be seen in every stage of the process of tumbling down, from\r\nthe first slight inclination, to such a dangerous slope that it becomes\r\na notice to quit to the occupiers.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical geniuses of the country have only discovered two ways of\r\nremedying the evil. One is, after it has commenced, to tie the house to\r\na post in the ground on the windward side by a rattan or bamboo cable.\r\nThe other is a preventive, but how they ever found it out and did not\r\ndiscover the true way is a mystery. This plan is, to build the house\r\nin the usual way, but instead of having all the principal supports\r\nof straight posts, to have two or three of them chosen as crooked as\r\npossible. I had often noticed these crooked posts in houses, but imputed\r\nit to the scarcity of good, straight timber, until one day I met some\r\nmen carrying home a post shaped something like a dog's hind leg, and\r\ninquired of my native boy what they were going to do with such a piece\r\nof wood. \"To make a post for a house,\" said he. \"But why don't they get\r\na straight one, there are plenty here?\" said I. \"Oh,\" replied he, \"they\r\nprefer some like that in a house, because then it won't fall,\" evidently\r\nimputing the effect to some occult property of crooked timber. A little\r\nconsideration and a diagram will, however, show, that the effect imputed\r\nto the crooked post may be really produced by it. A true square changes\r\nits figure readily into a rhomboid or oblique figure, but when one or\r\ntwo of the uprights are bent or sloping, and placed so as to oppose each\r\nother, the effect of a strut is produced, though in a rude and clumsy\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nJust before I had left Mamajam the people had sown a considerable\r\nquantity of maize, which appears above ground in two or three days, and\r\nin favourable seasons ripens in less than two months. Owing to a week's\r\npremature rains the ground was all flooded when I returned, and the\r\nplants just coming into ear were yellow and dead. Not a grain would be\r\nobtained by the whole village, but luckily it is only a luxury, not a\r\nnecessity of life. The rain was the signal for ploughing to begin, in\r\norder to sow rice on all the flat lands between us and the town. The\r\nplough used is a rude wooden instrument with a very short single handle,\r\na tolerably well-shaped coulter, and the point formed of a piece of hard\r\npalm-wood fastened in with wedges. One or two buffaloes draw it at a\r\nvery slow pace. The seed is sown broadcast, and a rude wooden harrow is\r\nused to smooth the surface.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of December the regular wet season had set in. Westerly\r\nwinds and driving rains sometimes continued for days together; the\r\nfields for miles around were under water, and the ducks and buffaloes\r\nenjoyed themselves amazingly. All along the road to Macassar, ploughing\r\nwas daily going on in the mud and water, through which the wooden plough\r\neasily makes its way, the ploughman holding the plough-handle with one\r\nhand while a long bamboo in the other serves to guide the buffaloes.\r\nThese animals require an immense deal of driving to get them on at all;\r\na continual shower of exclamations is kept up at them, and \"Oh! ah! Gee!\r\nugh!\" are to be heard in various keys and in an uninterrupted succession\r\nall day long. At night we were favoured with a different kind of\r\nconcert. The dry ground around my house had become a marsh tenanted by\r\nfrogs, who kept up a most incredible noise from dusk to dawn. They\r\nwere somewhat musical too, having a deep vibrating note which at times\r\nclosely resembles the tuning of two or three bass-viols in an orchestra.\r\nIn Malacca and Borneo I had heard no such sounds as these, which\r\nindicates that the frogs, like most of the animals of Celebes, are of\r\nspecies peculiar to it.\r\n\r\nMy kind friend and landlord, Mr. Mesman, was a good specimen of the\r\nMacassar-born Dutchman. He was about thirty-five years of age, had a\r\nlarge family, and lived in a spacious house near the town, situated\r\nin the midst of a grove of fruit trees, and surrounded by a perfect\r\nlabyrinth of offices, stables, and native cottages occupied by his\r\nnumerous servants, slaves, or dependants. He usually rose before the\r\nsun, and after a cup of coffee looked after his servants, horses, and\r\ndogs, until seven, when a substantial breakfast of rice and meat was\r\nready in a cool verandah. Putting on a clean white linen suit, he then\r\ndrove to town in his buggy, where he had an office, with two or three\r\nChinese clerks who looked after his affairs. His business was that of\r\na coffee and opium merchant. He had a coffee estate at Bontyne, and\r\na small prau which traded to the Eastern islands near New Guinea, for\r\nmother-of-pearl and tortoiseshell. About one he would return home,\r\nhave coffee and cake or fried plantain, first changing his dress for a\r\ncoloured cotton shirt and trousers and bare feet, and then take a siesta\r\nwith a book. About four, after a cup of tea, he would walk round his\r\npremises, and generally stroll down to Mamajam to pay me a visit, and\r\nlook after his farm.\r\n\r\nThis consisted of a coffee plantation and an orchard of fruit trees,\r\na dozen horses and a score of cattle, with a small village of Timorese\r\nslaves and Macassar servants. One family looked after the cattle and\r\nsupplied the house with milk, bringing me also a large glassful every\r\nmorning, one of my greatest luxuries. Others had charge of the horses,\r\nwhich were brought in every afternoon and fed with cut grass. Others had\r\nto cut grass for their master's horses at Macassar--not a very easy task\r\nin the dry season, when all the country looks like baked mud; or in\r\nthe rainy season, when miles in every direction are flooded. How they\r\nmanaged it was a mystery to me, but they know grass must be had, and\r\nthey get it. One lame woman had charge of a flock of ducks. Twice a\r\nday she took them out to feed in the marshy places, let them waddle and\r\ngobble for an hour or two, and then drove them back and shut them up\r\nin a small dark shed to digest their meal, whence they gave forth\r\noccasionally a melancholy quack. Every night a watch was set,\r\nprincipally for the sake of the horses--the people of Goa, only two\r\nmiles off, being notorious thieves, and horses offering the easiest and\r\nmost valuable spoil. This enabled me to sleep in security, although many\r\npeople in Macassar thought I was running a great risk, living alone in\r\nsuch a solitary place and with such bad neighbours.\r\n\r\nMy house was surrounded by a kind of straggling hedge of roses,\r\njessamines, and other flowers, and every morning one of the women\r\ngathered a basketful of the blossoms for Mr. Mesman's family. I\r\ngenerally took a couple for my own breakfast table, and the supply never\r\nfailed during my stay, and I suppose never does. Almost every Sunday Mr.\r\nM. made a shooting excursion with his eldest son, a lad of fifteen, and\r\nI generally accompanied him; for though the Dutch are Protestants,\r\nthey do not observe Sunday in the rigid manner practised in England and\r\nEnglish colonies. The Governor of the place has his public reception\r\nevery Sunday evening, when card-playing is the regular amusement.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th I went on board a prau bound for the Aru Islands, a\r\njourney which will be described in the latter part of this work.\r\n\r\nOn my return, after a seven months' absence, I visited another district\r\nto the north of Macassar, which will form the subject of the next\r\nCHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. CELEBES.\r\n\r\n (MACASSAR, JULY TO NOVEMBER, 1857.)\r\n\r\nI REACHED Macassar again on the 11th of July, and established myself in\r\nmy old quarters at Mamajam, to sort, arrange, clean, and pack up my Aru\r\ncollections. This occupied me a month; and having shipped them off for\r\nSingapore, had my guns repaired, and received a new one from England,\r\ntogether with a stock of pins, arsenic, and other collecting requisites.\r\nI began to feel eager for work again, and had to consider where I should\r\nspend my time until the end of the year; I had left Macassar seven\r\nmonths before, a flooded marsh being ploughed up for the rice-sowing.\r\nThe rains had continued for five months, yet now all the rice was cut,\r\nand dry and dusty stubble covered the country just as when I had first\r\narrived there.\r\n\r\nAfter much inquiry I determined to visit the district of Maros, about\r\nthirty miles north of Macassar, where Mr. Jacob Mesman, a brother of my\r\nfriend, resided, who had kindly offered to find me house-room and\r\ngive me assistance should I feel inclined to visit him. I accordingly\r\nobtained a pass from the Resident, and having hired a boat set off one\r\nevening for Maros. My boy Ali was so ill with fever that I was obliged\r\nto leave him in the hospital, under the care of my friend the German\r\ndoctor, and I had to make shift with two new servants utterly ignorant\r\nof everything. We coasted along during the night, and at daybreak\r\nentered the Maros river, and by three in the afternoon reached the\r\nvillage. I immediately visited the Assistant Resident, and applied for\r\nten men to carry my baggage, and a horse for myself. These were promised\r\nto be ready that night, so that I could start as soon as I liked in the\r\nmorning. After having taken a cup of tea I took my leave, and slept in\r\nthe boat. Some of the men came at night as promised, but others did not\r\narrive until the next morning. It took some time to divide my baggage\r\nfairly among them, as they all wanted to shirk the heavy boxes, and\r\nwould seize hold of some light article and march off with it, until made\r\nto come back and wait until the whole had been fairly apportioned. At\r\nlength about eight o'clock all was arranged, and we started for our walk\r\nto Mr. M.'s farm.\r\n\r\nThe country was at first a uniform plain of burned-up rice-grounds, but\r\nat a few miles' distance precipitous hills appeared, backed by the lofty\r\ncentral range of the peninsula. Towards these our path lay, and after\r\nhaving gone six or eight miles the hills began to advance into the plain\r\nright and left of us, and the ground became pierced here and there with\r\nblocks and pillars of limestone rock, while a few abrupt conical hills\r\nand peaks rose like islands. Passing over an elevated tract forming\r\nthe shoulder of one of the hills, a picturesque scene lay before us.\r\nWe looked down into a little valley almost entirely surrounded by\r\nmountains, rising abruptly in huge precipices, and forming a succession\r\nof knolls and peaks and domes of the most varied and fantastic shapes.\r\nIn the very centre of the valley was a large bamboo house, while\r\nscattered around were a dozen cottages of the same material.\r\n\r\nI was kindly received by Mr. Jacob Mesman in an airy saloon detached\r\nfrom the house, and entirely built of bamboo and thatched with grass.\r\nAfter breakfast he took me to his foreman's house, about a hundred yards\r\noff, half of which was given up to me until I should decide where to\r\nhave a cottage built for my own use. I soon found that this spot was too\r\nmuch exposed to the wind and dust, which rendered it very difficult\r\nto work with papers or insects. It was also dreadfully hot in the\r\nafternoon, and after a few days I got a sharp attack of fever, which\r\ndetermined me to move. I accordingly fixed on a place about a mile off,\r\nat the foot of a forest-covered hill, where in a few days Mr. M. built\r\nfor me a nice little house, consisting of a good-sized enclosed verandah\r\nor open room, and a small inner sleeping-room, with a little cookhouse\r\noutside. As soon as it was finished I moved into it, and found the\r\nchange most agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe forest which surrounded me was open and free from underwood,\r\nconsisting of large trees, widely scattered with a great quantity of\r\npalm-trees (Arenga saccharifera), from which palm wine and sugar\r\nare made. There were also great numbers of a wild Jack-fruit tree\r\n(Artocarpus), which bore abundance of large reticulated fruit, serving\r\nas an excellent vegetable. The ground was as thickly covered with dry\r\nleaves as it is in an English wood in November; the little rocky streams\r\nwere all dry, and scarcely a drop of water or even a damp place was\r\nanywhere to be seen. About fifty yards below my house, at the foot of\r\nthe hill, was a deep hole in a watercourse where good water was to be\r\nhad, and where I went daily to bathe by having buckets of water taken\r\nout and pouring it over my body.\r\n\r\nMy host Mr. M. enjoyed a thoroughly country life, depending almost\r\nentirely on his gun and dogs to supply his table. Wild pigs of large\r\nsize were very plentiful and he generally got one or two a week, besides\r\ndeer occasionally, and abundance of jungle-fowl, hornbills, and great\r\nfruit pigeons. His buffaloes supplied plenty of milk from which he made\r\nhis own butter; he grew his own rice and coffee, and had ducks, fowls,\r\nand their eggs, in profusion. His palm-trees supplied him all the year\r\nround with \"sagueir,\" which takes the place of beer; and the sugar made\r\nfrom them is an excellent sweetmeat. All the fine tropical vegetables\r\nand fruits were abundant in their season, and his cigars were made from\r\ntobacco of his own raising. He kindly sent me a bamboo of buffalo-milk\r\nevery morning; it was as thick as cream, and required diluting with\r\nwater to keep it fluid during the day. It mixes very well with tea and\r\ncoffee, although it has a slight peculiar flavour, which after a time\r\nis not disagreeable. I also got as much sweet \"sagueir\" as I liked to\r\ndrink, and Mr. M. always sent me a piece of each pig he killed, which\r\nwith fowls, eggs, and the birds we shot ourselves, and buffalo beef\r\nabout once a fortnight, kept my larder sufficiently well supplied.\r\n\r\nEvery bit of flatland was cleared and used as rice-fields, and on the\r\nlower slopes of many of the hills tobacco and vegetables were grown.\r\nMost of the slopes are covered with huge blocks of rock, very fatiguing\r\nto scramble over, while a number of the hills are so precipitous as to\r\nbe quite inaccessible. These circumstances, combined with the excessive\r\ndrought, were very unfavourable for my pursuits. Birds were scarce, and\r\nI got but few new to me. Insects were tolerably plentiful, but unequal.\r\nBeetles, usually so numerous and interesting, were exceedingly scarce,\r\nsome of the families being quite absent and others only represented\r\nby very minute species. The Flies and Bees, on the other hand, were\r\nabundant, and of these I daily obtained new and interesting species. The\r\nrare and beautiful Butterflies of Celebes were the chief object of my\r\nsearch, and I found many species altogether new to me, but they were\r\ngenerally so active and shy as to render their capture a matter of great\r\ndifficulty. Almost the only good place for them was in the dry beds of\r\nthe streams in the forest, where, at damp places, muddy pools, or even\r\non the dry rocks, all sorts of insects could be found. In these rocky\r\nforests dwell some of the finest butterflies in the world. Three species\r\nof Ornithoptera, measuring seven or eight inches across the wings, and\r\nbeautifully marked with spots or masses of satiny yellow on a black\r\nground, wheel through the thickets with a strong sailing flight. About\r\nthe damp places are swarms of the beautiful blue-banded Papilios,\r\nmiletus and telephus, the superb golden green P. macedon, and the rare\r\nlittle swallow-tail Papilio rhesus, of all of which, though very active,\r\nI succeeded in capturing fine series of specimens.\r\n\r\nI have rarely enjoyed myself more than during my residence here. As I\r\nsat taking my coffee at six in the morning, rare birds would often\r\nbe seen on some tree close by, when I would hastily sally out in my\r\nslippers, and perhaps secure a prize I had been seeking after for weeks.\r\nThe great hornbills of Celebes (Buceros cassidix) would often come with\r\nloud-flapping wings, and perch upon a lofty tree just in front of me;\r\nand the black baboon-monkeys, Cynopithecus nigrescens, often stared down\r\nin astonishment at such an intrusion into their domains while at\r\nnight herds of wild pigs roamed about the house, devouring refuse, and\r\nobliging us to put away everything eatable or breakable from our little\r\ncooking-house. A few minutes' search on the fallen trees around my house\r\nat sunrise and sunset, would often produce me more beetles than I would\r\nmeet with in a day's collecting, and odd moments could be made valuable\r\nwhich when living in villages or at a distance from the forest are\r\ninevitably wasted. Where the sugar-palms were dripping with sap, flies\r\ncongregated in immense numbers, and it was by spending half an hour at\r\nthese when I had the time to spare, that I obtained the finest and most\r\nremarkable collection of this group of insects that I have ever made.\r\n\r\nThen what delightful hours I passed wandering up and down the dry\r\nriver-courses, full of water-holes and rocks and fallen trees, and\r\novershadowed by magnificent vegetation. I soon got to know every hole\r\nand rock and stump, and came up to each with cautious step and bated\r\nbreath to see what treasures it would produce. At one place I would find\r\na little crowd of the rare butterfly Tachyris zarinda, which would\r\nrise up at my approach, and display their vivid orange and cinnabar-red\r\nwings, while among them would flutter a few of the fine blue-banded\r\nPapilios. Where leafy branches hung over the gully, I might expect to\r\nfind a grand Ornithoptera at rest and an easy prey. At certain rotten\r\ntrunks I was sure to get the curious little tiger beetle, Therates\r\nflavilabris. In the denser thickets I would capture the small metal-blue\r\nbutterflies (Amblypodia) sitting on the leaves, as well as some rare and\r\nbeautiful leaf-beetles of the families Hispidae and Chrysomelidae.\r\n\r\nI found that the rotten jack-fruits were very attractive to many\r\nbeetles, and used to split them partly open and lay them about in the\r\nforest near my house to rot. A morning's search at these often produced\r\nme a score of species--Staphylinidae, Nitidulidae, Onthophagi, and\r\nminute Carabidae, being the most abundant. Now and then the \"sagueir\"\r\nmakers brought me a fine rosechafer (Sternoplus schaumii) which they\r\nfound licking up the sweet sap. Almost the only new birds I met with\r\nfor some time were a handsome ground thrush (Pitta celebensis), and a\r\nbeautiful violet-crowned dove (Ptilonopus celebensis), both very similar\r\nto birds I had recently obtained at Aru, but of distinct species.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter part of September a heavy shower of rain fell,\r\nadmonishing us that we might soon expect wet weather, much to the\r\nadvantage of the baked-up country. I therefore determined to pay a visit\r\nto the falls of the Maros river, situated at the point where it issues\r\nfrom the mountains--a spot often visited by travellers and considered\r\nvery beautiful. Mr. M. lent me a horse, and I obtained a guide from a\r\nneighbouring village; and taking one of my men with me, we started\r\nat six in the morning, and after a ride of two hours over the flat\r\nrice-fields skirting the mountains which rose in grand precipices on our\r\nleft, we reached the river about half-way between Maros and the falls,\r\nand thence had a good bridle-road to our destination, which we reached\r\nin another hour. The hills had closed in around us as we advanced;\r\nand when we reached a ruinous shed which had been erected for the\r\naccommodation of visitors, we found ourselves in a flat-bottomed\r\nvalley about a quarter of a mile wide, bounded by precipitous and often\r\noverhanging limestone rocks. So far the ground had been cultivated, but\r\nit now became covered with bushes and large scattered trees.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my scanty baggage had arrived and was duly deposited in the\r\nshed, I started off alone for the fall, which was about a quarter of a\r\nmile further on. The river is here about twenty yards wide, and issues\r\nfrom a chasm between two vertical walls of limestone, over a rounded\r\nmass of basaltic rock about forty feet high, forming two curves\r\nseparated by a slight ledge. The water spreads beautifully over this\r\nsurface in a thin sheet of foam, which curls and eddies in a succession\r\nof concentric cones until it falls into a fine deep pool below. Close\r\nto the very edge of the fall a narrow and very rugged path leads to the\r\nriver above, and thence continues close under the precipice along the\r\nwater's edge, or sometimes in the water, for a few hundred yards, after\r\nwhich the rocks recede a little, and leave a wooded bank on one side,\r\nalong which the path is continued, until in about half a mile, a second\r\nand smaller fall is reached. Here the river seems to issue from a\r\ncavern, the rocks having fallen from above so as to block up the channel\r\nand bar further progress. The fall itself can only be reached by a path\r\nwhich ascends behind a huge slice of rock which has partly fallen\r\naway from the mountain, leaving a space two or three feet wide, but\r\ndisclosing a dark chasm descending into the bowels of the mountain, and\r\nwhich, having visited several such, I had no great curiosity to explore.\r\n\r\nCrossing the stream a little below the upper fall, the path ascends\r\na steep slope for about five hundred feet, and passing through a\r\ngap enters a narrow valley, shut in by walls of rock absolutely\r\nperpendicular and of great height. Half a mile further this valley turns\r\nabruptly to the right, and becomes a mere rift in the mountain. This\r\nextends another half mile, the walls gradually approaching until they\r\nare only two feet apart, and the bottom rising steeply to a pass which\r\nleads probably into another valley, but which I had no time to explore.\r\nReturning to where this rift had begun the main path turns up to the\r\nleft in a sort of gully, and reaches a summit over which a fine natural\r\narch of rock passes at a height of about fifty feet. Thence was a steep\r\ndescent through thick jungle with glimpses of precipices and distant\r\nrocky mountains, probably leading into the main river valley again. This\r\nwas a most tempting region to explore, but there were several reasons\r\nwhy I could go no further. I had no guide, and no permission to enter\r\nthe Bugis territories, and as the rains might at any time set in,\r\nI might be prevented from returning by the flooding of the river. I\r\ntherefore devoted myself during the short time of my visit to obtaining\r\nwhat knowledge I could of the natural productions of the place.\r\n\r\nThe narrow chasms produced several fine insects quite new to me, and one\r\nnew bird, the curious Phlaegenas tristigmata, a large ground pigeon\r\nwith yellow breast and crown, and purple neck. This rugged path is the\r\nhighway from Maros to the Bugis country beyond the mountains. During\r\nthe rainy season it is quite impassable, the river filling its bed and\r\nrushing between perpendicular cliffs many hundred feet high. Even at the\r\ntime of my visit it was most precipitous and fatiguing, yet women and\r\nchildren came over it daily, and men carrying heavy loads of palm sugar\r\n(of very little value). It was along the path between the lower and the\r\nupper falls, and about the margin of the upper pool, that I found most\r\ninsects. The large semi-transparent butterfly, Idea tondana, flew lazily\r\nalong by dozens, and it was here that I at length obtained an insect\r\nwhich I had hoped but hardly expected to meet with--the magnificent\r\nPapilio androcles, one of the largest and rarest known swallow-tailed\r\nbutterflies. During my four days' stay at the falls, I was so fortunate\r\nas to obtain six good specimens. As this beautiful creature flies, the\r\nlong white tails flicker like streamers, and when settled on the beach\r\nit carries them raised upwards, as if to preserve them from injury. It\r\nis scarce even here, as I did not see more than a dozen specimens\r\nin all, and had to follow many of them up and down the river's bank\r\nrepeatedly before I succeeded in their capture. When the sun shone\r\nhottest, about noon, the moist beach of the pool below the upper\r\nfall presented a beautiful sight, being dotted with groups of gay\r\nbutterflies--orange, yellow, white, blue, and green--which on being\r\ndisturbed rose into the air by hundreds, forming clouds of variegated\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nSuch gorges, chasms, and precipices here abound, as I have nowhere seen\r\nin the Archipelago. A sloping surface is scarcely anywhere to be found,\r\nhuge walls and rugged masses of rock terminating all the mountains\r\nand enclosing the valleys. In many parts there are vertical or even\r\noverhanging precipices five or six hundred feet high, yet completely\r\nclothed with a tapestry of vegetation. Ferns, Pandanaceae, shrubs,\r\ncreepers, and even forest trees, are mingled in an evergreen network,\r\nthrough the interstices of which appears the white limestone rock or\r\nthe dark holes and chasms with which it abounds. These precipices\r\nare enabled to sustain such an amount of vegetation by their peculiar\r\nstructure. Their surfaces are very irregular, broken into holes and\r\nfissures, with ledges overhanging the mouths of gloomy caverns; but from\r\neach projecting part have descended stalactites, often forming a wild\r\ngothic tracery over the caves and receding hollows, and affording an\r\nadmirable support to the roots of the shrubs, trees, and creepers, which\r\nluxuriate in the warm pure atmosphere and the gentle moisture which\r\nconstantly exudes from the rocks. In places where the precipice offers\r\nsmooth surfaces of solid rock, it remains quite bare, or only stained\r\nwith lichens, and dotted with clumps of ferns that grow on the small\r\nledges and in the minutest crevices.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is familiar with tropical nature only through the medium\r\nof books and botanical gardens will picture to himself in such a spot\r\nmany other natural beauties. He will think that I have unaccountably\r\nforgotten to mention the brilliant flowers, which, in gorgeous masses of\r\ncrimson, gold or azure, must spangle these verdant precipices, hang over\r\nthe cascade, and adorn the margin of the mountain stream. But what is\r\nthe reality? In vain did I gaze over these vast walls of verdure, among\r\nthe pendant creepers and bushy shrubs, all around the cascade on the\r\nriver's bank, or in the deep caverns and gloomy fissures--not one single\r\nspot of bright colour could be seen, not one single tree or bush or\r\ncreeper bore a flower sufficiently conspicuous to form an object in\r\nthe landscape. In every direction the eye rested on green foliage and\r\nmottled rock. There was infinite variety in the colour and aspect of\r\nthe foliage; there was grandeur in the rocky masses and in the exuberant\r\nluxuriance of the vegetation; but there was no brilliancy of colour,\r\nnone of those bright flowers and gorgeous masses of blossom so generally\r\nconsidered to be everywhere present in the tropics. I have here given an\r\naccurate sketch of a luxuriant tropical scene as noted down on the spot,\r\nand its general characteristics as regards colour have been so often\r\nrepeated, both in South America and over many thousand miles in the\r\nEastern tropics, that I am driven to conclude that it represents the\r\ngeneral aspect of nature at the equatorial (that is, the most tropical)\r\nparts of the tropical regions.\r\n\r\nHow is it then, that the descriptions of travellers generally give\r\na very different idea? and where, it may be asked, are the glorious\r\nflowers that we know do exist in the tropics? These questions can be\r\neasily answered. The fine tropical flowering-plants cultivated in our\r\nhothouses have been culled from the most varied regions, and therefore\r\ngive a most erroneous idea of their abundance in any one region. Many of\r\nthem are very rare, others extremely local, while a considerable number\r\ninhabit the more arid regions of Africa and India, in which tropical\r\nvegetation does not exhibit itself in its usual luxuriance. Fine and\r\nvaried foliage, rather than gay flowers, is more characteristic of those\r\nparts where tropical vegetation attains its highest development, and in\r\nsuch districts each kind of flower seldom lasts in perfection more than\r\na few weeks, or sometimes a few days. In every locality a lengthened\r\nresidence will show an abundance of magnificent and gaily-blossomed\r\nplants, but they have to be sought for, and are rarely at any one time\r\nor place so abundant as to form a perceptible feature in the landscape.\r\nBut it has been the custom of travellers to describe and group together\r\nall the fine plants they have met with during a long journey, and thus\r\nproduce the effect of a gay and flower-painted landscape. They have\r\nrarely studied and described individual scenes where vegetation was most\r\nluxuriant and beautiful, and fairly stated what effect was produced\r\nin them by flowers. I have done so frequently, and the result of these\r\nexaminations has convinced me that the bright colours of flowers have a\r\nmuch greater influence on the general aspect of nature in temperate\r\nthan in tropical climates. During twelve years spent amid the grandest\r\ntropical vegetation, I have seen nothing comparable to the effect\r\nproduced on our landscapes by gorse, broom, heather, wild hyacinths,\r\nhawthorn, purple orchises, and buttercups.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of this part of Celebes is interesting.\r\nThe limestone mountains, though of great extent, seem to be entirely\r\nsuperficial, resting on a basis of basalt which in some places forms low\r\nrounded hills between the more precipitous mountains. In the rocky beds\r\nof the streams basalt is almost always found, and it is a step in this\r\nrock which forms the cascade already described. From it the limestone\r\nprecipices rise abruptly; and in ascending the little stairway along the\r\nside of the fall, you step two or three times from one rock on to the\r\nother--the limestone dry and rough, being worn by the water and rains\r\ninto sharp ridges and honeycombed holes--the basalt moist, even, and\r\nworn smooth and slippery by the passage of bare-footed pedestrians. The\r\nsolubility of the limestone by rain-water is well seen in the little\r\nblocks and peaks which rise thickly through the soil of the alluvial\r\nplains as you approach the mountains. They are all skittle-shaped,\r\nlarger in the middle than at the base, the greatest diameter occurring\r\nat the height to which the country is flooded in the wet season,\r\nand thence decreasing regularly to the ground. Many of them overhang\r\nconsiderably, and some of the slenderer pillars appear to stand upon a\r\npoint. When the rock is less solid it becomes curiously honeycombed by\r\nthe rains of successive winters, and I noticed some masses reduced to\r\na complete network of stone through which light could be seen in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFrom these mountains to the sea extends a perfectly flat alluvial plain,\r\nwith no indication that water would accumulate at a great depth beneath\r\nit, yet the authorities at Macassar have spent much money in boring a\r\nwell a thousand feet deep in hope of getting a supply of water like that\r\nobtained by the Artesian wells in the London and Paris basins. It is not\r\nto be wondered at that the attempt was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nReturning to my forest hut, I continued my daily search after birds and\r\ninsects. The weather, however, became dreadfully hot and dry, every drop\r\nof water disappearing from the pools and rock-holes, and with it the\r\ninsects which frequented them. Only one group remained unaffected by\r\nthe intense drought; the Diptera, or two-winged flies, continued as\r\nplentifully as ever, and on these I was almost compelled to concentrate\r\nmy attention for a week or two, by which means I increased my collection\r\nof that Order to about two hundred species. I also continued to obtain\r\na few new birds, among which were two or three kinds of small hawks and\r\nfalcons, a beautiful brush-tongued paroquet, Trichoglossus ornatus, and\r\na rare black and white crow, Corvus advena.\r\n\r\nAt length, about the middle of October, after several gloomy days, down\r\ncame a deluge of rain which continued to fall almost every afternoon,\r\nshowing that the early part of the wet season had commenced. I hoped\r\nnow to get a good harvest of insects, and in some respects I was not\r\ndisappointed. Beetles became much more numerous, and under a thick bed\r\nof leaves that had accumulated on some rocks by the side of a forest\r\nstream, I found an abundance of Carabidae, a family generally scarce in\r\nthe tropics. The butterflies, however, disappeared. Two of my servants\r\nwere attacked with fever, dysentery, and swelled feet, just at the time\r\nthat the third had left me, and for some days they both lay groaning in\r\nthe house. When they got a little better I was attacked myself, and as\r\nmy stores were nearly finished and everything was getting very damp,\r\nI was obliged to prepare for my return to Macassar, especially as the\r\nstrong westerly winds would render the passage in a small open boat\r\ndisagreeable, if not dangerous.\r\n\r\nSince the rains began, numbers of huge millipedes, as thick as one's\r\nfinger and eight or ten inches long, crawled about everywhere--in the\r\npaths, on trees, about the house--and one morning when I got up I even\r\nfound one in my bed! They were generally of a dull lead colour or of\r\na deep brick red, and were very nasty-looking things to be coming\r\neverywhere in one's way, although quite harmless. Snakes too began to\r\nshow themselves. I killed two of a very abundant species--big-headed,\r\nand of a bright green colour, which lie coiled up on leaves and shrubs\r\nand can scarcely be seen until one is close upon them. Brown snakes got\r\ninto my net while beating among dead leaves for insects, and made me\r\nrather cautious about inserting my hand until I knew what kind of game I\r\nhad captured. The fields and meadows which had been parched and sterile,\r\nnow became suddenly covered with fine long grass; the river-bed where\r\nI had so many times walked over burning rocks, was now a deep and rapid\r\nstream; and numbers of herbaceous plants and shrubs were everywhere\r\nspringing up and bursting into flower. I found plenty of new insects,\r\nand if I had had a good, roomy, water-and-wind-proof house, I should\r\nperhaps have stayed during the wet season, as I feel sure many things\r\ncan then be obtained which are to be found at no other time. With my\r\nsummer hut, however, this was impossible. During the heavy rains a fine\r\ndrizzly mist penetrated into every part of it, and I began to have the\r\ngreatest difficulty in keeping my specimens dry.\r\n\r\nEarly in November I returned to Macassar, and having packed up my\r\ncollections, started in the Dutch mail steamer for Amboyna and Ternate.\r\nLeaving this part of my journey for the present, I will in the next\r\nCHAPTER conclude my account of Celebes, by describing the extreme\r\nnorthern part of the island which I visited two years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. CELEBES.\r\n\r\n (MENADO, JUNE TO SEPTEMBER, 1859.)\r\n\r\nIT was after my residence at Timor-Coupang that I visited the\r\nnortheastern extremity of Celebes, touching Banda, Amboyna, and Ternate\r\non my way. I reached Menado on the 10th of June, 1859, and was very\r\nkindly received by Mr. Tower, an Englishman, but a very old resident in\r\nMenado, where he carries on a general business. He introduced me to Mr.\r\nL. Duivenboden (whose father had been my friend at Ternate), who had\r\nmuch taste for natural history; and to Mr. Neys, a native of Menado, but\r\nwho was educated at Calcutta, and to whom Dutch, English, and Malay\r\nwere equally mother-tongues. All these gentlemen showed me the greatest\r\nkindness, accompanied me in my earliest walks about the country, and\r\nassisted me by every means in their power. I spent a week in the\r\ntown very pleasantly, making explorations and inquiries after a good\r\ncollecting station, which I had much difficulty in finding, owing to the\r\nwide cultivation of coffee and cacao, which has led to the clearing\r\naway of the forests for many miles around the town, and over extensive\r\ndistricts far into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe little town of Menado is one of the prettiest in the East. It has\r\nthe appearance of a large garden containing rows of rustic villas with\r\nbroad paths between, forming streets generally at right angles with each\r\nother. Good roads branch off in several directions towards the interior,\r\nwith a succession of pretty cottages, neat gardens, and thriving\r\nplantations, interspersed with wildernesses of fruit trees. To the west\r\nand south the country is mountainous, with groups of fine volcanic peaks\r\n6,000 or 7,000 feet high, forming grand and picturesque backgrounds to\r\nthe landscape.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Minahasa (as this part of Celebes is called) differ\r\nmuch from those of all the rest of the island, and in fact from any\r\nother people in the Archipelago. They are of a light-brown or yellow\r\ntint, often approaching the fairness of a European; of a rather short\r\nstature, stout and well-made; of an open and pleasing countenance, more\r\nor less disfigured as age increases by projecting check-bones; and with\r\nthe usual long, straight, jet-black hair of the Malayan races. In some\r\nof the inland villages where they may be supposed to be of the purest\r\nrace, both men and women are remarkably handsome; while nearer the\r\ncoasts where the purity of their blood has been destroyed by the\r\nintermixture of other races, they approach to the ordinary types of the\r\nwild inhabitants of the surrounding countries.\r\n\r\nIn mental and moral characteristics they are also highly peculiar.\r\nThey are remarkably quiet and gentle in disposition, submissive to the\r\nauthority of those they consider their superiors, and easily induced\r\nto learn and adopt the habits of civilized people. They are clever\r\nmechanics, and seem capable of acquiring a considerable amount of\r\nintellectual education.\r\n\r\nUp to a very recent period these people were thorough savages, and\r\nthere are persons now living in Menado who remember a state of things\r\nidentical with that described by the writers of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries. The inhabitants of the several villages\r\nwere distinct tribes, each under its own chief, speaking languages\r\nunintelligible to each other, and almost always at war. They built their\r\nhouses elevated upon lofty posts to defend themselves from the attacks\r\nof their enemies. They were headhunters like the Dyaks of Borneo, and\r\nwere said to be sometimes cannibals. When a chief died, his tomb was\r\nadorned with two fresh human heads; and if those of enemies could not\r\nbe obtained, slaves were killed for the occasion. Human skulls were the\r\ngreat ornaments of the chiefs' houses. Strips of bark were their only\r\ndress. The country was a pathless wilderness, with small cultivated\r\npatches of rice and vegetables, or clumps of fruit-trees, diversifying\r\nthe otherwise unbroken forest. Their religion was that naturally\r\nengendered in the undeveloped human mind by the contemplation of grand\r\nnatural phenomena and the luxuriance of tropical nature. The burning\r\nmountain, the torrent and the lake, were the abode of their deities;\r\nand certain trees and birds were supposed to have special influence\r\nover men's actions and destiny. They held wild and exciting festivals\r\nto propitiate these deities or demons, and believed that men could be\r\nchanged by them into animals--either during life or after death.\r\n\r\nHere we have a picture of true savage life; of small isolated\r\ncommunities at war with all around them, subject to the wants and\r\nmiseries of such a condition, drawing a precarious existence from the\r\nluxuriant soil, and living on, from generation to generation, with no\r\ndesire for physical amelioration, and no prospect of moral advancement.\r\n\r\nSuch was their condition down to the year 1822, when the coffee-plant\r\nwas first introduced, and experiments were made as to its cultivation.\r\nIt was found to succeed admirably from fifteen hundred feet, up to four\r\nthousand feet above the sea. The chiefs of villages were induced to\r\nundertake its cultivation. Seed and native instructors were sent\r\nfrom Java; food was supplied to the labourers engaged in clearing and\r\nplanting; a fixed price was established at which all coffee brought to\r\nthe government collectors was to be paid for, and the village chiefs who\r\nnow received the titles of \"Majors\" were to receive five percent of the\r\nproduce. After a time, roads were made from the port of Menado up to\r\nthe plateau, and smaller paths were cleared from village to village;\r\nmissionaries settled in the more populous districts and opened schools;\r\nand Chinese traders penetrated to the interior and supplied clothing and\r\nother luxuries in exchange for the money which the sale of the coffee\r\nhad produced.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the country was divided into districts, and the system\r\nof \"Controlleurs,\" which had worked so well in Java, was introduced. The\r\n\"Controlleur\" was a European, or a native of European blood, who was the\r\ngeneral superintendent of the cultivation of the district, the\r\nadviser of the chiefs, the protector of the people, and the means of\r\ncommunication between both and the European Government. His duties\r\nobliged him to visit every village in succession once a month, and to\r\nsend in a report on their condition to the Resident. As disputes between\r\nadjacent villages were now settled by appeal to a superior authority,\r\nthe old and inconvenient semi-fortified houses were disused, and under\r\nthe direction of the \"Controlleurs\" most of the houses were rebuilt on a\r\nneat and uniform plan. It was this interesting district which I was now\r\nabout to visit.\r\n\r\nHaving decided on my route, I started at 8 A.M. on the 22d of June.\r\nMr. Tower drove me the first three miles in his chaise, and Mr. Neys\r\naccompanied me on horseback three miles further to the village of\r\nLotta. Here we met the Controlleur of the district of Tondano, who was\r\nreturning home from one of his monthly tours, and who had agreed to act\r\nas my guide and companion on the journey. From Lotta we had an almost\r\ncontinual ascent for six miles, which brought us on to the plateau of\r\nTondano at an elevation of about 2,400 feet. We passed through three\r\nvillages whose neatness and beauty quite astonished me. The main road,\r\nalong which all the coffee is brought down from the interior in carts\r\ndrawn by buffaloes, is always turned aside at the entrance of a village,\r\nso as to pass behind it, and thus allow the village street itself to\r\nbe kept neat and clean. This is bordered by neat hedges often formed\r\nentirely of rose-trees, which are perpetually in blossom. There is a\r\nbroad central path and a border of fine turf, which is kept well swept\r\nand neatly cut. The houses are all of wood, raised about six feet on\r\nsubstantial posts neatly painted blue, while the walls are whitewashed.\r\nThey all have a verandah enclosed with a neat balustrade, and are\r\ngenerally surrounded by orange-trees and flowering shrubs. The\r\nsurrounding scenery is verdant and picturesque. Coffee plantations\r\nof extreme luxuriance, noble palms and tree ferns, wooded hills and\r\nvolcanic peaks, everywhere meet the eye. I had heard much of the beauty\r\nof this country, but the reality far surpassed my expectations.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock we reached Tomohón, the chief place of a district,\r\nhaving a native chief now called the \"Major,\" at whose house we were to\r\ndine. Here was a fresh surprise for me. The house was large, airy and\r\nvery substantially built of hard native timber, squared and put together\r\nin a most workmanlike manner. It was furnished in European style, with\r\nhandsome chandelier lamps, and the chairs and tables all well made by\r\nnative workmen. As soon as we entered, madeira and bitters were offered\r\nus. Then two handsome boys neatly dressed in white, and with smoothly\r\nbrushed jet-black hair, handed us each a basin of water and a clean\r\nnapkin on a salver. The dinner was excellent. Fowls cooked in various\r\nways; wild pig roasted, stewed and fried; a fricassee of bats, potatoes,\r\nrice and other vegetables; all served on good china, with finger glasses\r\nand fine napkins, and abundance of good claret and beer, seemed to\r\nme rather curious at the table of a native chief on the mountains of\r\nCelebes. Our host was dressed in a suit of black with patent-leather\r\nshoes, and really looked comfortable and almost gentlemanly in them. He\r\nsat at the head of the table and did the honours well, though he did\r\nnot talk much. Our conversation was entirely in Malay, as that is the\r\nofficial language here, and in fact the mother-tongue and only language\r\nof the Controlleur, who is a native-born half-breed. The Major's father\r\nwho was chief before him, wore, I was informed, a strip of bark as his\r\nsole costume, and lived in a rude but raised home on lofty poles, and\r\nabundantly decorated with human heads. Of course we were expected, and\r\nour dinner was prepared in the best style, but I was assured that the\r\nchiefs all take a pride in adopting European customs, and in being able\r\nto receive their visitors in a handsome manner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner and coffee, the Controlleur went on to Tondano, and I\r\nstrolled about the village waiting for my baggage, which was coming in\r\na bullock-cart, and did not arrive until after midnight. Supper was very\r\nsimilar to dinner, and on retiring I found an elegant little room with\r\na comfortable bed, gauze curtains with blue and red hangings, and every\r\nconvenience. Next morning at sunrise the thermometer in the verandah\r\nstood at 69°, which I was told is about the usual lowest temperature at\r\nthis place, 2,500 feet above the sea. I had a good breakfast of coffee,\r\neggs, and fresh bread and butter, which I took in the spacious verandah\r\namid the odour of roses, jessamine, and other sweet-scented flowers,\r\nwhich filled the garden in front; and about eight o'clock left Tomohón\r\nwith a dozen men carrying my baggage.\r\n\r\nOur road lay over a mountain ridge about 4,000 feet above the sea, and\r\nthen descended about 500 feet to the little village of Rurúkan, the\r\nhighest in the district of Minahasa, and probably in all Celebes. Here I\r\nhad determined to stay for some time to see whether this elevation would\r\nproduce any change in the zoology. The village had only been formed\r\nabout ten years, and was quite as neat as those I had passed through,\r\nand much more picturesque. It is placed on a small level spot, from\r\nwhich there is an abrupt wooded descent down to the beautiful lake of\r\nTondano, with volcanic mountains beyond. On one side is a ravine, and\r\nbeyond it a fine mountainous and wooded country.\r\n\r\nNear the village are the coffee plantations. The trees are planted in\r\nrows, and are kept topped to about seven feet high. This causes the\r\nlateral branches to grow very strong, so that some of the trees become\r\nperfect hemispheres, loaded with fruit from top to bottom, and producing\r\nfrom ten to twenty pounds each of cleaned coffee annually. These\r\nplantations were all formed by the Government, and are cultivated by the\r\nvillagers under the direction of their chief. Certain days are appointed\r\nfor weeding or gathering, and the whole working population are summoned\r\nby the sound of a gong. An account is kept of the number of hours' work\r\ndone by each family, and at the year's end, the produce of the sale is\r\ndivided among them proportionately. The coffee is taken to Government\r\nstores established at central places over the whole country, and is paid\r\nfor at a low fixed price. Out of this a certain percentage goes to the\r\nchiefs and majors, and the remainder is divided among the inhabitants.\r\nThis system works very well, and I believe is at present far better for\r\nthe people than free-trade would be. There are also large rice-fields,\r\nand in this little village of seventy houses, I was informed that a\r\nhundred pounds' worth of rice was sold annually.\r\n\r\nI had a small house at the very end of the village, almost hanging over\r\nthe precipitous slope down to the stream, and with a splendid view from\r\nthe verandah. The thermometer in the morning often stood at 62° and\r\nnever rose so high as 80°, so that with the thin clothing used in the\r\ntropical plains we were always cool and sometimes positively cold, while\r\nthe spout of water where I went daily for my bath had quite an icy\r\nfeel. Although I enjoyed myself very much among these fine mountains\r\nand forests, I was somewhat disappointed as to my collections. There\r\nwas hardly any perceptible difference between the animal life in this\r\ntemperate region and in the torrid plains below, and what difference\r\ndid exist was in most respects disadvantageous to me. There seemed to be\r\nnothing absolutely peculiar to this elevation. Birds and quadrupeds were\r\nless plentiful, but of the same species. In insects there seemed to be\r\nmore difference. The curious beetles of the family Cleridae, which are\r\nfound chiefly on bark and rotten wood, were finer than I have seen them\r\nelsewhere. The beautiful Longicorns were scarcer than usual, and the few\r\nbutterflies were all of tropical species. One of these, Papilio blumei,\r\nof which I obtained a few specimens only, is among the most magnificent\r\nI have ever seen. It is a green and gold swallow-tail, with azure-blue\r\nand spoon-shaped tails, and was often seen flying about the village when\r\nthe sun shone, but in a very shattered condition. The great amount\r\nof wet and cloudy weather was a great drawback all the time I was at\r\nRurúkan.\r\n\r\nEven in the vegetation there is very little to indicate elevation.\r\nThe trees are more covered with lichens and mosses, and the ferns and\r\ntree-ferns are finer and more luxuriant than I had been accustomed to\r\nseeing on the low grounds, both probably attributable to the almost\r\nperpetual moisture that here prevails. Abundance of a tasteless\r\nraspberry, with blue and yellow compositae, have somewhat of a temperate\r\naspect; and minute ferns and Orchideae, with dwarf Begonias on the\r\nrocks, make some approach to a sub-alpine vegetation. The forest,\r\nhowever, is most luxuriant. Noble palms, Pandani, and tree-ferns are\r\nabundant in it, while the forest trees are completely festooned with\r\nOrchideae, Bromeliae, Araceae, Lycopodiums, and mosses. The ordinary\r\nstemless ferns abound; some with gigantic fronds ten or twelve feet\r\nlong, others barely an inch high; some with entire and massive leaves,\r\nothers elegantly waving their finely-cut foliage, and adding endless\r\nvariety and interest to the forest paths. The cocoa-nut palm still\r\nproduces fruit abundantly, but is said to be deficient in oil. Oranges\r\nthrive better than below, producing abundance of delicious fruit; but\r\nthe shaddock or pumplemous (Citrus decumana) requires the full force of\r\na tropical sun, for it will not thrive even at Tondano a thousand feet\r\nlower. On the hilly slopes rice is cultivated largely, and ripens well,\r\nalthough the temperature rarely or never rises to 80°, so that one would\r\nthink it might be grown even in England in fine summers, especially if\r\nthe young plants were raised under glass.\r\n\r\nThe mountains have an unusual quantity of earth and vegetable mould\r\nspread over them. Even on the steepest slopes there is everywhere a\r\ncovering of clays and sands, and generally a good thickness of vegetable\r\nsoil. It is this which perhaps contributes to the uniform luxuriance\r\nof the forest, and delays the appearance of that sub-alpine vegetation\r\nwhich depends almost as much on the abundance of rocky and exposed\r\nsurfaces as on difference of climate. At a much lower elevation on\r\nMount Ophir in Malacca, Dacrydiums and Rhododendrons with abundance of\r\nNepenthes, ferns, and terrestrial orchids suddenly took the place of the\r\nlofty forest; but this was plainly due to the occurrence of an extensive\r\nslope of bare, granitic rock at an elevation of less than 3,000 feet.\r\nThe quantity of vegetable soil, and also of loose sands and clays,\r\nresting on steep slopes, hill-tops and the sides of ravines, is a\r\ncurious and important phenomenon. It may be due in part to constant,\r\nslight earthquake shocks facilitating the disintegration of rock; but,\r\nwould also seem to indicate that the country has been long exposed to\r\ngentle atmospheric action, and that its elevation has been exceedingly\r\nslow and continuous.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Rurúkan, my curiosity was satisfied by experiencing a\r\npretty sharp earthquake-shock. On the evening of June 29th, at a quarter\r\nafter eight, as I was sitting reading, the house began shaking with a\r\nvery gentle, but rapidly increasing motion. I sat still enjoying the\r\nnovel sensation for some seconds; but in less than half a minute it\r\nbecame strong enough to shake me in my chair, and to make the house\r\nvisibly rock about, and creak and crack as if it would fall to pieces.\r\nThen began a cry throughout the village of \"Tana goyang! tana goyang!\"\r\n(Earthquake! earthquake!) Everybody rushed out of their houses--women\r\nscreamed and children cried--and I thought it prudent to go out too.\r\nOn getting up, I found my head giddy and my steps unsteady, and could\r\nhardly walk without falling. The shock continued about a minute, during\r\nwhich time I felt as if I had been turned round and round, and was\r\nalmost seasick. Going into the house again, I found a lamp and a bottle\r\nof arrack upset. The tumbler which formed the lamp had been thrown out\r\nof the saucer in which it had stood. The shock appeared to be nearly\r\nvertical, rapid, vibratory, and jerking. It was sufficient, I have no\r\ndoubt, to have thrown down brick, chimneys, walls, and church towers;\r\nbut as the houses here are all low, and strongly framed of timber, it\r\nis impossible for them to be much injured, except by a shock that would\r\nutterly destroy a European city. The people told me it was ten years\r\nsince they had had a stronger shock than this, at which time many houses\r\nwere thrown down and some people killed.\r\n\r\nAt intervals of ten minutes to half an hour, slight shocks and tremors\r\nwere felt, sometimes strong enough to send us all out again. There was\r\na strange mixture of the terrible and the ludicrous in our situation. We\r\nmight at any moment have a much stronger shock, which would bring down\r\nthe house over us, or--what I feared more--cause a landslip, and send\r\nus down into the deep ravine on the very edge of which the village is\r\nbuilt; yet I could not help laughing each time we ran out at a slight\r\nshock, and then in a few moments ran in again. The sublime and the\r\nridiculous were here literally but a step apart. On the one hand, the\r\nmost terrible and destructive of natural phenomena was in action\r\naround us--the rocks, the mountains, the solid earth were trembling and\r\nconvulsed, and we were utterly impotent to guard against the danger that\r\nmight at any moment overwhelm us. On the other hand was the spectacle of\r\na number of men, women, and children running in and out of their houses,\r\non what each time proved a very unnecessary alarm, as each shock ceased\r\njust as it became strong enough to frighten us. It seemed really very\r\nmuch like \"playing at earthquakes,\" and made many of the people join me\r\nin a hearty laugh, even while reminding each other that it really might\r\nbe no laughing matter.\r\n\r\nAt length the evening got very cold, and I became very sleepy, and\r\ndetermined to turn in; leaving orders to my boys, who slept nearer\r\nthe door, to wake me in case the house was in danger of falling. But\r\nI miscalculated my apathy, for I could not sleep much. The shocks\r\ncontinued at intervals of half an hour or an hour all night, just strong\r\nenough to wake me thoroughly each time and keep me on the alert, ready\r\nto jump up in case of danger. I was therefore very glad when morning\r\ncame. Most of the inhabitants had not been to bed at all, and some had\r\nstayed out of doors all night. For the next two days and nights shocks\r\nstill continued at short intervals, and several times a day for a week,\r\nshowing that there was some very extensive disturbance beneath our\r\nportion of the earth's crust. How vast the forces at work really are can\r\nonly be properly appreciated when, after feeling their effects, we look\r\nabroad over the wide expanse of hill and valley, plain and mountain, and\r\nthus realize in a slight degree the immense mass of matter heaved\r\nand shaken. The sensation produced by an earthquake is never to be\r\nforgotten. We feel ourselves in the grasp of a power to which the\r\nwildest fury of the winds and waves are as nothing; yet the effect is\r\nmore a thrill of awe than the terror which the more boisterous war of\r\nthe elements produces. There is a mystery and an uncertainty as to the\r\namount of danger we incur, which gives greater play to the imagination,\r\nand to the influences of hope and fear. These remarks apply only to a\r\nmoderate earthquake. A severe one is the most destructive and the most\r\nhorrible catastrophe to which human beings can be exposed.\r\n\r\nA few days after the earthquake I took a walk to Tondano, a large\r\nvillage of about 7,000 inhabitants, situated at the lower end of the\r\nlake of the same name. I dined with the Controlleur, Mr. Bensneider,\r\nwho had been my guide to Tomohón. He had a fine large house, in which he\r\noften received visitors; and his garden was the best for flowers which I\r\nhad seen in the tropics, although there was no great variety. It was he\r\nwho introduced the rose hedges which give such a charming appearance to\r\nthe villages; and to him is chiefly due the general neatness and good\r\norder that everywhere prevail. I consulted him about a fresh locality,\r\nas I found Rurúkan too much in the clouds, dreadfully damp and gloomy,\r\nand with a general stagnation of bird and insect life. He recommended me\r\na village some distance beyond the lake, near which was a large forest,\r\nwhere he thought I should find plenty of birds. As he was going himself\r\nin a few days, I decided to accompany him.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I asked him for a guide to the celebrated waterfall on the\r\noutlet stream of the lake. It is situated about a mile and half below\r\nthe village, where a slight rising ground closes in the basin, and\r\nevidently once formed, the shore of the lake. Here the river enters a\r\ngorge, very narrow and tortuous, along which it rushes furiously for a\r\nshort distance and then plunges into a great chasm, forming the head\r\nof a large valley. Just above the fall the channel is not more than ten\r\nfeet wide, and here a few planks are thrown across, whence, half hid by\r\nluxuriant vegetation, the mad waters may be seen rushing beneath, and a\r\nfew feet farther plunge into the abyss. Both sight and sound are grand\r\nand impressive. It was here that, four years before my visit, the\r\nGovernor-General of the Netherland Indies committed suicide, by leaping\r\ninto the torrent. This at least is the general opinion, as he suffered\r\nfrom a painful disease which was supposed to have made him weary of his\r\nlife. His body was found next day in the stream below.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no good view of the fall could now be obtained, owing\r\nto the quantity of wood and high grass that lined the margins of the\r\nprecipices. There are two falls, the lower being the most lofty; and it\r\nis possible, by long circuit, to descend into the valley and see them\r\nfrom below. Were the best points of view searched for and rendered\r\naccessible, these falls would probably be found to be the finest in the\r\nArchipelago. The chasm seems to be of great depth, probably 500 or 600\r\nfeet. Unfortunately, I had no time to explore this valley, as I was\r\nanxious to devote every fine day to increasing my hitherto scanty\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nJust opposite my abode in Rurúkan was the schoolhouse. The schoolmaster\r\nwas a native, educated by the Missionary at Tomohón. School was held\r\nevery morning for about three hours, and twice a week in the evening\r\nthere was catechising and preaching. There was also a service on Sunday\r\nmorning. The children were all taught in Malay, and I often heard them\r\nrepeating the multiplication-table, up to twenty times twenty, very\r\nglibly. They always wound up with singing, and it was very pleasing to\r\nhear many of our old psalm-tunes in these remote mountains, sung with\r\nMalay words. Singing is one of the real blessings which Missionaries\r\nintroduce among savage nations, whose native chants are almost always\r\nmonotonous and melancholy.\r\n\r\nOn catechising evenings the schoolmaster was a great man, preaching and\r\nteaching for three hours at a stretch much in the style of an English\r\nranter. This was pretty cold work for his auditors, however warming to\r\nhimself; and I am inclined to think that these native teachers, having\r\nacquired facility of speaking and an endless supply of religious\r\nplatitudes to talk about, ride their hobby rather hard, without much\r\nconsideration for their flock. The Missionaries, however, have much\r\nto be proud of in this country. They have assisted the Government in\r\nchanging a savage into a civilized community in a wonderfully short\r\nspace of time. Forty years ago the country was a wilderness, the people\r\nnaked savages, garnishing their rude houses with human heads. Now it is\r\na garden, worthy of its sweet native name of \"Minahasa.\" Good roads\r\nand paths traverse it in every direction; some of the finest coffee\r\nplantations in the world surround the villages, interspersed with\r\nextensive rice-fields more than sufficient for the support of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe people are now the most industrious, peaceable, and civilized in the\r\nwhole Archipelago. They are the best clothed, the best housed, the best\r\nfed, and the best educated; and they have made some progress towards\r\na higher social state. I believe there is no example elsewhere of such\r\nstriking results being produced in so short a time--results which are\r\nentirely due to the system of government now adopted by the Dutch in\r\ntheir Eastern possessions. The system is one which may be called a\r\n\"paternal despotism.\" Now we Englishmen do not like despotism--we hate\r\nthe name and the thing, and we would rather see people ignorant,\r\nlazy, and vicious, than use any but moral force to make them wise,\r\nindustrious, and good. And we are right when we are dealing with men of\r\nour own race, and of similar ideas and equal capacities with ourselves.\r\nExample and precept, the force of public opinion, and the slow, but sure\r\nspread of education, will do everything in time, without engendering any\r\nof those bitter feelings, or producing any of that servility, hypocrisy,\r\nand dependence, which are the sure results of despotic government. But\r\nwhat should we think of a man who should advocate these principles\r\nof perfect freedom in a family or a school? We should say that he was\r\napplying a good, general principle to a case in which the conditions\r\nrendered it inapplicable--the case in which the governed are in an\r\nadmitted state of mental inferiority to those who govern them, and are\r\nunable to decide what is best for their permanent welfare. Children must\r\nbe subjected to some degree of authority, and guidance; and if properly\r\nmanaged they will cheerfully submit to it, because they know their own\r\ninferiority, and believe their elders are acting solely for their good.\r\nThey learn many things the use of which they cannot comprehend, and\r\nwhich they would never learn without some moral and social, if not\r\nphysical, pressure. Habits of order, of industry, of cleanliness, of\r\nrespect and obedience, are inculcated by similar means. Children would\r\nnever grow up into well-behaved and well-educated men, if the same\r\nabsolute freedom of action that is allowed to men were allowed to them.\r\nUnder the best aspect of education, children are subjected to a\r\nmild despotism for the good of themselves and of society; and their\r\nconfidence in the wisdom and goodness of those who ordain and apply this\r\ndespotism, neutralizes the bad passions and degrading feelings, which\r\nunder less favourable conditions are its general results.\r\n\r\nNow, there is not merely an analogy--there is in many respects an\r\nidentity of relation between master and pupil or parent and child on the\r\none hand, and an uncivilized race and its civilized rulers on the other.\r\nWe know (or think we know) that the education and industry, and the\r\ncommon usages of civilized man, are superior to those of savage life;\r\nand, as he becomes acquainted with them, the savage himself admits this.\r\nHe admires the superior acquirements of the civilized man, and it is\r\nwith pride that he will adopt such usages as do not interfere too much\r\nwith his sloth, his passions, or his prejudices. But as the willful\r\nchild or the idle schoolboy, who was never taught obedience, and never\r\nmade to do anything which of his own free will he was not inclined to\r\ndo, would in most cases obtain neither education nor manners; so it is\r\nmuch more unlikely that the savage, with all the confirmed habits of\r\nmanhood and the traditional prejudices of race, should ever do more than\r\ncopy a few of the least beneficial customs of civilization, without some\r\nstronger stimulus than precept, very imperfectly backed by example.\r\n\r\nIf we are satisfied that we are right in assuming the government over a\r\nsavage race, and occupying their country, and if we further consider it\r\nour duty to do what we can to improve our rude subjects and raise them\r\nup towards our own level, we must not be too much afraid of the cry\r\nof \"despotism\" and \"slavery,\" but must use the authority we possess to\r\ninduce them to do work which they may not altogether like, but which\r\nwe know to be an indispensable step in their moral and physical\r\nadvancement. The Dutch have shown much good policy in the means by which\r\nthey have done this. They have in most cases upheld and strengthened the\r\nauthority of the native chiefs, to whom the people have been accustomed\r\nto render a voluntary obedience; and by acting on the intelligence and\r\nself-interest of these chiefs, have brought about changes in the manners\r\nand customs of the people, which would have excited ill-feeling and\r\nperhaps revolt, had they been directly enforced by foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out such a system, much depends upon the character of the\r\npeople; and the system which succeeds admirably in one place could\r\nonly be very partially worked out in another. In Minahasa the natural\r\ndocility and intelligence of the race have made their progress rapid;\r\nand how important this is, is well illustrated by the fact, that in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the town of Menado are a tribe called Banteks,\r\nof a much less tractable disposition, who have hitherto resisted all\r\nefforts of the Dutch Government to induce them to adopt any systematic\r\ncultivation. These remain in a ruder condition, but engage themselves\r\nwillingly as occasional porters and labourers, for which their greater\r\nstrength and activity well adapt them.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the system here sketched seems open to serious objection. It\r\nis to a certain extent despotic, and interferes with free trade, free\r\nlabour, and free communication. A native cannot leave his village\r\nwithout a pass, and cannot engage himself to any merchant or captain\r\nwithout a Government permit. The coffee has all to be sold to\r\nGovernment, at less than half the price that the local merchant would\r\ngive for it, and he consequently cries out loudly against \"monopoly\"\r\nand \"oppression.\" He forgets, however, that the coffee plantations were\r\nestablished by the Government at great outlay of capital and skill; that\r\nit gives free education to the people, and that the monopoly is in lieu\r\nof taxation. He forgets that the product he wants to purchase and make\r\na profit by, is the creation of the Government, without whom the people\r\nwould still be savages. He knows very well that free trade would, as its\r\nfirst result, lead to the importation of whole cargoes of arrack,\r\nwhich would be carried over the country and exchanged for coffee. That\r\ndrunkenness and poverty would spread over the land; that the public\r\ncoffee plantations would not be kept up; that the quality and quantity\r\nof the coffee would soon deteriorate; that traders and merchants would\r\nget rich, but that the people would relapse into poverty and barbarism.\r\nThat such is invariably the result of free trade with any savage tribes\r\nwho possess a valuable product, native or cultivated, is well known to\r\nthose who have visited such people; but we might even anticipate from\r\ngeneral principles that evil results would happen.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing rather than another to which the grand law of\r\ncontinuity or development will apply, it is to human progress. There are\r\ncertain stages through which society must pass in its onward march from\r\nbarbarism to civilization. Now one of these stages has always been\r\nsome form or other of despotism, such as feudalism or servitude, or a\r\ndespotic paternal government; and we have every reason to believe that\r\nit is not possible for humanity to leap over this transition epoch, and\r\npass at once from pure savagery to free civilization. The Dutch system\r\nattempts to supply this missing link, and to bring the people on by\r\ngradual steps to that higher civilization, which we (the English) try to\r\nforce upon them at once. Our system has always failed. We demoralize and\r\nwe extirpate, but we never really civilize. Whether the Dutch system\r\ncan permanently succeed is but doubtful, since it may not be possible to\r\ncompress the work of ten centuries into one; but at all events it takes\r\nnature as a guide, and is therefore, more deserving of success, and more\r\nlikely to succeed, than ours.\r\n\r\nThere is one point connected with this question which I think the\r\nMissionaries might take up with great physical and moral results. In\r\nthis beautiful and healthy country, and with abundance of food and\r\nnecessaries, the population does not increase as it ought to do. I can\r\nonly impute this to one cause. Infant mortality, produced by neglect\r\nwhile the mothers are working in the plantations, and by general\r\nignorance of the conditions of health in infants. Women all work, as\r\nthey have always been accustomed to do. It is no hardship to them, but\r\nI believe is often a pleasure and relaxation. They either take their\r\ninfants with them, in which case they leave them in some shady spot on\r\nthe ground, going at intervals to give them nourishment, or they leave\r\nthem at home in the care of other children too young to work. Under\r\nneither of these circumstances can infants be properly attended to, and\r\ngreat mortality is the result, keeping the increase of population far\r\nbelow the rate which the general prosperity of the country and the\r\nuniversality of marriage would lead us to expect. This is a matter in\r\nwhich the Government is directly interested, since it is by the increase\r\nof the population alone that there can be any large and permanent\r\nincrease in the production of coffee. The Missionaries should take up\r\nthe question because, by inducing married women to confine themselves to\r\ndomestic duties, they will decidedly promote a higher civilization, and\r\ndirectly increase the health and happiness of the whole community. The\r\npeople are so docile and so willing to adopt the manners and customs of\r\nEuropeans, that the change might be easily effected by merely showing\r\nthem that it was a question of morality and civilization, and an\r\nessential step in their progress towards an equality with their white\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight's stay at Rurúkan, I left that pretty and interesting\r\nvillage in search of a locality and climate more productive of birds and\r\ninsects. I passed the evening with the Controlleur of Tondano, and the\r\nnext morning at nine, left in a small boat for the head of the lake, a\r\ndistance of about ten miles. The lower end of the lake is bordered by\r\nswamps and marshes of considerable extent, but a little further on, the\r\nhills come down to the water's edge and give it very much the appearance\r\nof a greet river, the width being about two miles. At the upper end is\r\nthe village of Kakas, where I dined with the head man in a good house\r\nlike those I have already described; and then went on to Langówan, four\r\nmiles distant over a level plain. This was the place where I had been\r\nrecommended to stay, and I accordingly unpacked my baggage and made\r\nmyself comfortable in the large house devoted to visitors. I obtained\r\na man to shoot for me, and another to accompany me the next day to the\r\nforest, where I was in hopes of finding a good collecting ground.\r\n\r\nIn the morning after breakfast I started off, but found I had four miles\r\nto walk over a wearisome straight road through coffee plantations before\r\nI could get to the forest, and as soon as I did so, it came on to rain\r\nheavily and did not cease until night. This distance to walk every day\r\nwas too far for any profitable work, especially when the weather was so\r\nuncertain. I therefore decided at once that I must go further on, until\r\nI found someplace close to or in a forest country. In the afternoon my\r\nfriend Mr. Bensneider arrived, together with the Controlleur of the next\r\ndistrict, called Belang, from whom I learned that six miles further on\r\nthere was a village called Panghu, which had been recently formed and\r\nhad a good deal of forest close to it; and he promised me the use of a\r\nsmall house if I liked to go there.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I went to see the hot-springs and mud volcanoes, for\r\nwhich this place is celebrated. A picturesque path among plantations\r\nand ravines brought us to a beautiful circular basin about forty feet in\r\ndiameter, bordered by a calcareous ledge, so uniform and truly curved,\r\nthat it looked like a work of art. It was filled with clear water\r\nvery near the boiling point, and emitted clouds of steam with a strong\r\nsulphureous odour. It overflows at one point and forms a little stream\r\nof hot water, which at a hundred yards' distance is still too hot to\r\nhold the hand in. A little further on, in a piece of rough wood, were\r\ntwo other springs not so regular in outline, but appearing to be much\r\nhotter, as they were in a continual state of active ebullition. At\r\nintervals of a few minutes, a great escape of steam or gas took place,\r\nthrowing up a column of water three or four feet high.\r\n\r\nWe then went to the mud-springs, which are about a mile off, and are\r\nstill more curious. On a sloping tract of ground in a slight hollow is\r\na small lake of liquid mud, with patches of blue, red, or white, and\r\nin many places boiling and bubbling most furiously. All around on the\r\nindurated clay are small wells and craters full of boiling mud. These\r\nseem to be forming continually, a small hole appearing first, which\r\nemits jets of steam and boiling mud, which upon hardening, forms a\r\nlittle cone with a crater in the middle. The ground for some distance is\r\nvery unsafe, as it is evidently liquid at a small depth, and bends with\r\npressure like thin ice. At one of the smaller, marginal jets which I\r\nmanaged to approach, I held my hand to see if it was really as hot as it\r\nlooked, when a little drop of mud that spurted on to my finger scalded\r\nlike boiling water.\r\n\r\nA short distance off, there was a flat bare surface of rock as smooth\r\nand hot as an oven floor, which was evidently an old mud-pool, dried\r\nup and hardened. For hundreds of yards around where there were banks of\r\nreddish and white clay used for whitewash, it was still so hot close to\r\nthe surface that the hand could hardly bear to be held in cracks a few\r\ninches deep, and from which arose a strong sulphureous vapour. I was\r\ninformed that some years back a French gentleman who visited these\r\nsprings ventured too near the liquid mud, when the crust gave way and he\r\nwas engulfed in the horrible caldron.\r\n\r\nThis evidence of intense heat so near the surface over a large tract\r\nof country was very impressive, and I could hardly divest myself of the\r\nnotion that some terrible catastrophe might at any moment devastate\r\nthe country. Yet it is probable that all these apertures are really\r\nsafety-valves, and that the inequalities of the resistance of various\r\nparts of the earth's crust will always prevent such an accumulation of\r\nforce as would be required to upheave and overwhelm any extensive area.\r\nAbout seven miles west of this is a volcano which was in eruption about\r\nthirty years before my visit, presenting a magnificent appearance and\r\ncovering the surrounding country with showers of ashes. The plains\r\naround the lake formed by the intermingling and decomposition of\r\nvolcanic products are of amazing fertility, and with a little management\r\nin the rotation of crops might be kept in continual cultivation. Rice is\r\nnow grown on them for three or four years in succession, when they are\r\nleft fallow for the same period, after which rice or maize can be again\r\ngrown. Good rice produces thirty-fold, and coffee trees continue\r\nbearing abundantly for ten or fifteen years, without any manure and with\r\nscarcely any cultivation.\r\n\r\nI was delayed a day by incessant rain, and then proceeded to Panghu,\r\nwhich I reached just before the daily rain began at 11 A.M. After\r\nleaving the summit level of the lake basin, the road is carried along\r\nthe slope of a fine forest ravine. The descent is a long one, so that I\r\nestimated the village to be not more than 1,500 feet above the sea, yet\r\nI found the morning temperature often 69°, the same as at Tondano at\r\nleast 600 or 700 feet higher. I was pleased with the appearance of the\r\nplace, which had a good deal of forest and wild country around it; and\r\nfound prepared for me a little house consisting only of a verandah and a\r\nback room. This was only intended for visitors to rest in, or to pass a\r\nnight, but it suited me very well. I was so unfortunate, however, as\r\nto lose both my hunters just at this time. One had been left at Tondano\r\nwith fever and diarrhoea, and the other was attacked at Langówan with\r\ninflammation of the chest, and as his case looked rather bad I had\r\nhim sent back to Menado. The people here were all so busy with their\r\nrice-harvest, which was important for them to finish owing to the early\r\nrains, that I could get no one to shoot for me.\r\n\r\nDuring the three weeks that I stayed at Panghu it rained nearly every\r\nday, either in the afternoon only, or all day long; but there were\r\ngenerally a few hours' sunshine in the morning, and I took advantage of\r\nthese to explore the roads and paths, the rocks and ravines, in search\r\nof insects. These were not very abundant, yet I saw enough to convince\r\nme that the locality was a good one, had I been there at the beginning\r\ninstead of at the end of the dry season. The natives brought me daily a\r\nfew insects obtained at the Sagueir palms, including some fine Cetonias\r\nand stag-beetles. Two little boys were very expert with the blowpipe,\r\nand brought me a good many small birds, which they shot with pellets\r\nof clay. Among these was a pretty little flower-pecker of a new species\r\n(Prionochilus aureolimbatus), and several of the loveliest honeysuckers\r\nI had yet seen. My general collection of birds was, however, almost at\r\na standstill; for though I at length obtained a man to shoot for me, he\r\nwas not good for much, and seldom brought me more than one bird a day.\r\nThe best thing he shot was the large and rare fruit-pigeon peculiar to\r\nNorthern Celebes (Carpophaga forsteni), which I had long been seeking.\r\n\r\nI was myself very successful in one beautiful group of insects, the\r\ntiger-beetles, which seem more abundant and varied here than anywhere\r\nelse in the Archipelago. I first met with them on a cutting in the road,\r\nwhere a hard clayey bank was partially overgrown with mosses and small\r\nferns. Here, I found running about, a small olive-green species which\r\nnever took flight; and more rarely, a fine purplish black wingless\r\ninsect, which was always found motionless in crevices, and was\r\ntherefore, probably nocturnal. It appeared to me to form a new genus.\r\nAbout the roads in the forest, I found the large and handsome Cicindela\r\nheros, which I had before obtained sparingly at Macassar; but it was in\r\nthe mountain torrent of the ravine itself that I got my finest things.\r\nOn dead trunks overhanging the water and on the banks and foliage, I\r\nobtained three very pretty species of Cicindela, quite distinct in size,\r\nform, and colour, but having an almost identical pattern of pale spots.\r\nI also found a single specimen of a most curious species with very long\r\nantennae. But my finest discovery here was the Cicindela gloriosa, which\r\nI found on mossy stones just rising above the water. After obtaining\r\nmy first specimen of this elegant insect, I used to walk up the stream,\r\nwatching carefully every moss-covered rock and stone. It was rather shy,\r\nand would often lead me on a long chase from stone to stone, becoming\r\ninvisible every time it settled on the damp moss, owing to its rich\r\nvelvety green colour. On some days I could only catch a few glimpses of\r\nit; on others I got a single specimen; and on a few occasions two, but\r\nnever without a more or less active pursuit. This and several other\r\nspecies I never saw but in this one ravine.\r\n\r\nAmong the people here I saw specimens of several types, which, with the\r\npeculiarities of the languages, gives me some notion of their probable\r\norigin. A striking illustration of the low state of civilization\r\nof these people, until quite recently, is to be found in the great\r\ndiversity of their languages. Villages three or four miles apart have\r\nseparate dialects, and each group of three or four such villages has a\r\ndistinct language quite unintelligible to all the rest; so that, until\r\nthe recent introduction of Malay by the Missionaries, there must\r\nhave been a bar to all free communication. These languages offer\r\nmany peculiarities. They contain a Celebes-Malay element and a Papuan\r\nelement, along with some radical peculiarities found also in the\r\nlanguages of the Siau and Sanguir islands further north, and therefore,\r\nprobably derived from the Philippine Islands. Physical characteristics\r\ncorrespond. There are some of the less civilized tribes which have\r\nsemi-Papuan features and hair, while in some villages the true Celebes\r\nor Bugis physiognomy prevails. The plateau of Tondano is chiefly\r\ninhabited by people nearly as white as the Chinese, and with very\r\npleasing semi-European features. The people of Siau and Sanguir much\r\nresemble these, and I believe them to be perhaps immigrants from some\r\nof the islands of North Polynesia. The Papuan type will represent the\r\nremnant of the aborigines, while those of the Bugis character show the\r\nextension northward of the superior Malay races.\r\n\r\nAs I was wasting valuable time at Panghu, owing to the bad weather and\r\nthe illness of my hunters, I returned to Menado after a stay of three\r\nweeks. Here I had a little touch of fever, and what with drying and\r\npacking all of my collections and getting fresh servants, it was a\r\nfortnight before I was again ready to start. I now went eastward over\r\nan undulating country skirting the great volcano of Klabat, to a village\r\ncalled Lempias, situated close to the extensive forest that covers the\r\nlower slopes of that mountain. My baggage was carried from village to\r\nvillage by relays of men; and as each change involved some delay, I did\r\nnot reach my destination (a distance of eighteen miles) until sunset. I\r\nwas wet through, and had to wait for an hour in an uncomfortable\r\nstate until the first installment of my baggage arrived, which luckily\r\ncontained my clothes, while the rest did not come in until midnight.\r\n\r\nThis being the district inhabited by that singular annual the Babirusa\r\n(Hog-deer), I inquired about skulls and soon obtained several in\r\ntolerable condition, as well as a fine one of the rare and curious\r\n\"Sapi-utan\" (Anoa depressicornis). Of this animal I had seen two living\r\nspecimens at Menado, and was surprised at their great resemblance to\r\nsmall cattle, or still more to the Eland of South Africa. Their Malay\r\nname signifies \"forest ox,\" and they differ from very small highbred\r\noxen principally by the low-hanging dewlap, and straight, pointed horns\r\nwhich slope back over the neck. I did not find the forest here so rich\r\nin insects as I had expected, and my hunters got me very few birds, but\r\nwhat they did obtain were very interesting. Among these were the rare\r\nforest Kingfisher (Cittura cyanotis), a small new species of Megapodius,\r\nand one specimen of the large and interesting Maleo (Megacephalon\r\nrubripes), to obtain which was one of my chief reasons for visiting this\r\ndistrict. Getting no more, however, after ten days' search, I removed\r\nto Licoupang, at the extremity of the peninsula, a place celebrated for\r\nthese birds, as well as for the Babirusa and Sapi-utan. I found here\r\nMr. Goldmann, the eldest son of the Governor of the Moluccas, who was\r\nsuperintending the establishment of some Government salt-works. This was\r\na better locality, and I obtained some fine butterflies and very\r\ngood birds, among which was one more specimen of the rare ground dove\r\n(Phlegaenas tristigmata), which I had first obtained near the Maros\r\nwaterfall in South Celebes.\r\n\r\nHearing what I was particularly in search of, Mr. Goldmann kindly\r\noffered to make a hunting-party to the place where the \"Maleos\" are most\r\nabundant, a remote and uninhabited sea-beach about twenty miles distant.\r\nThe climate here was quite different from that on the mountains; not a\r\ndrop of rain having fallen for four months; so I made arrangements to\r\nstay on the beach a week, in order to secure a good number of specimens.\r\nWe went partly by boat and partly through the forest, accompanied by the\r\nMajor or head-man of Licoupang, with a dozen natives and about twenty\r\ndogs. On the way they caught a young Sapi-utan and five wild pigs. Of\r\nthe former I preserved the head. This animal is entirely confined to the\r\nremote mountain forests of Celebes and one or two adjacent islands which\r\nform part of the same group. In the adults the head is black, with a\r\nwhite mark over each eye, one on each cheek and another on the throat.\r\nThe horns are very smooth and sharp when young, but become thicker and\r\nridged at the bottom with age. Most naturalists consider this curious\r\nanimal to be a small ox, but from the character of the horns, the fine\r\ncoat of hair and the descending dewlap, it seemed closely to approach\r\nthe antelopes.\r\n\r\nArrived at our destination, we built a but and prepared for a stay of\r\nsome days--I to shoot and skin \"Maleos\", and Mr. Goldmann and the Major\r\nto hunt wild pigs, Babirusa, and Sapi-utan. The place is situated in the\r\nlarge bay between the islands of Limbe and Banca, and consists of\r\nsteep beach more than a mile in length, of deep loose and coarse black\r\nvolcanic sand (or rather gravel), very fatiguing to walk over. It is\r\nbounded at each extremity by a small river with hilly ground beyond,\r\nwhile the forest behind the beach itself is tolerably level and its\r\ngrowth stunted. We probably have here an ancient lava stream from the\r\nKlabat volcano, which has flowed down a valley into the sea, and the\r\ndecomposition of which has formed the loose black sand. In confirmation\r\nof this view, it may be mentioned that the beaches beyond the small\r\nrivers in both directions are of white sand.\r\n\r\nIt is in this loose, hot, black sand that those singular birds, the\r\n\"Maleos\" deposit their eggs. In the months of August and September, when\r\nthere is little or no rain, they come down in pairs from the interior to\r\nthis or to one or two other favourite spots, and scratch holes three or\r\nfour feet deep, just above high-water mark, where the female deposits a\r\nsingle large egg, which she covers over with about a foot of sand--and\r\nthen returns to the forest. At the end of ten or twelve days she comes\r\nagain to the same spot to lay another egg, and each female bird is\r\nsupposed to lay six or eight eggs during the season. The male assists\r\nthe female in making the hole, coming down and returning with her. The\r\nappearance of the bird when walking on the beach is very handsome.\r\nThe glossy black and rosy white of the plumage, the helmeted head and\r\nelevated tail, like that of the common fowl, give a striking character,\r\nwhich their stately and somewhat sedate walk renders still more\r\nremarkable. There is hardly any difference between the sexes, except\r\nthat the casque or bonnet at the back of the head and the tubercles at\r\nthe nostrils are a little larger, and the beautiful rosy salmon colour a\r\nlittle deeper in the male bird; but the difference is so slight that it\r\nis not always possible to tell a male from a female without dissection.\r\nThey run quickly, but when shot at or suddenly disturbed, take wing with\r\na heavy noisy flight to some neighbouring tree, where they settle on a\r\nlow branch; and, they probably roost at night in a similar situation.\r\nMany birds lay in the same hole, for a dozen eggs are often found\r\ntogether; and these are so large that it is not possible for the body of\r\nthe bird to contain more than one fully-developed egg at the same time.\r\nIn all the female birds which I shot, none of the eggs besides the one\r\nlarge one exceeded the size of peas, and there were only eight or nine\r\nof these, which is probably the extreme number a bird can lay in one\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nEvery year the natives come for fifty miles round to obtain these eggs,\r\nwhich are esteemed as a great delicacy, and when quite fresh, are indeed\r\ndelicious. They are richer than hens' eggs and of a finer favour, and\r\neach one completely fills an ordinary teacup, and forms with bread or\r\nrice a very good meal. The colour of the shell is a pale brick red, or\r\nvery rarely pure white. They are elongate and very slightly smaller at\r\none end, from four to four and a half inches long by two and a quarter\r\nor two and a half wide.\r\n\r\nAfter the eggs are deposited in the sand, they are no further cared for\r\nby the mother. The young birds, upon breaking the shell, work their way\r\nup through the sand and run off at once to the forest; and I was assured\r\nby Mr. Duivenboden of Ternate, that they can fly the very day they are\r\nhatched. He had taken some eggs on board his schooner which hatched\r\nduring the night, and in the morning the little birds flew readily\r\nacross the cabin. Considering the great distances the birds come to\r\ndeposit the eggs in a proper situation (often ten or fifteen miles) it\r\nseems extraordinary that they should take no further care of them. It\r\nis, however, quite certain that they neither do nor can watch them. The\r\neggs being deposited by a number of hens in succession in the same hole,\r\nwould render it impossible for each to distinguish its own; and the food\r\nnecessary for such large birds (consisting entirely of fallen fruits)\r\ncan only be obtained by roaming over an extensive district, so that\r\nif the numbers of birds which come down to this single beach in the\r\nbreeding season, amounting to many hundreds, were obliged to remain in\r\nthe vicinity, many would perish of hunger.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the feet of this bird, we may detect a cause for\r\nits departing from the habits of its nearest allies, the Megapodii and\r\nTalegalli, which heap up earth, leaves, stones, and sticks into a huge\r\nmound, in which they bury their eggs. The feet of the Maleo are not\r\nnearly so large or strong in proportion as in these birds, while its\r\nclaws are short and straight instead of being long and much curved. The\r\ntoes are, however, strongly webbed at the base, forming a broad powerful\r\nfoot, which, with the rather long leg, is well adapted to scratch away\r\nthe loose sand (which flies up in a perfect shower when the birds are at\r\nwork), but which could not without much labour accumulate the heaps of\r\nmiscellaneous rubbish, which the large grasping feet of the Megapodius\r\nbring together with ease.\r\n\r\nWe may also, I think, see in the peculiar organization of the entire\r\nfamily of the Megapodidae or Brush Turkeys, a reason why they depart so\r\nwidely from the usual habits of the Class of birds. Each egg being so\r\nlarge as entirely to fill up the abdominal cavity and with difficulty\r\npass the walls of the pelvis, a considerable interval is required before\r\nthe successive eggs can be matured (the natives say about thirteen\r\ndays). Each bird lays six or eight eggs or even more each season, so\r\nthat between the first and last there may be an interval of two or three\r\nmonths. Now, if these eggs were hatched in the ordinary way, either the\r\nparents must keep sitting continually for this long period, or if they\r\nonly began to sit after the last egg was deposited, the first would\r\nbe exposed to injury by the climate, or to destruction by the large\r\nlizards, snakes, or other animals which abound in the district; because\r\nsuch large birds must roam about a good deal in search of food. Here\r\nthen we seem to have a case in which the habits of a bird may be\r\ndirectly traced to its exceptional organization; for it will hardly be\r\nmaintained that this abnormal structure and peculiar food were given\r\nto the Megapodidae in order that they might not exhibit that parental\r\naffection, or possess those domestic instincts so general in the Class\r\nof birds, and which so much excite our admiration.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been the custom of writers on Natural History to take\r\nthe habits and instincts of animals as fixed points, and to consider\r\ntheir structure and organization, as specially adapted, to be in\r\naccordance with these. This assumption is however an arbitrary one, and\r\nhas the bad effect of stifling inquiry into the nature and causes\r\nof \"instincts and habits,\" treating them as directly due to a \"first\r\ncause,\" and therefore, incomprehensible to us. I believe that a careful\r\nconsideration of the structure of a species, and of the peculiar\r\nphysical and organic conditions by which it is surrounded, or has been\r\nsurrounded in past ages, will often, as in this case, throw much light\r\non the origin of its habits and instincts. These again, combined with\r\nchanges in external conditions, react upon structure, and by means of\r\n\"variation\" and \"natural selection\", both are kept in harmony.\r\n\r\nMy friends remained three days, and got plenty of wild pigs and two\r\nAnóas, but the latter were much injured by the dogs, and I could only\r\npreserve the heads. A grand hunt which we attempted on the third day\r\nfailed, owing to bad management in driving in the game, and we waited\r\nfor five hours perched on platforms in trees without getting a shot,\r\nalthough we had been assured that pigs, Babirusas, and Anóas would rush\r\npast us in dozens. I myself, with two men, stayed three days longer to\r\nget more specimens of the Maleos, and succeeded in preserving twenty-six\r\nvery fine ones--the flesh and eggs of which supplied us with abundance\r\nof good food.\r\n\r\nThe Major sent a boat, as he had promised, to take home my baggage,\r\nwhile I walked through the forest with my two boys and a guide, about\r\nfourteen miles. For the first half of the distance there was no path,\r\nand we had often to cut our way through tangled rattans or thickets of\r\nbamboo. In some of our turnings to find the most practicable route,\r\nI expressed my fear that we were losing our way, as the sun being\r\nvertical, I could see no possible clue to the right direction. My\r\nconductors, however, laughed at the idea, which they seemed to\r\nconsider quite ludicrous; and sure enough, about half way, we suddenly\r\nencountered a little hut where people from Licoupang came to hunt and\r\nsmoke wild pigs. My guide told me he had never before traversed the\r\nforest between these two points; and this is what is considered by some\r\ntravellers as one of the savage \"instincts,\" whereas it is merely the\r\nresult of wide general knowledge. The man knew the topography of the\r\nwhole district; the slope of the land, the direction of the streams, the\r\nbelts of bamboo or rattan, and many other indications of locality and\r\ndirection; and he was thus enabled to hit straight upon the hut, in\r\nthe vicinity of which he had often hunted. In a forest of which he knew\r\nnothing, he would be quite as much at a loss as a European. Thus it is,\r\nI am convinced, with all the wonderful accounts of Indians finding their\r\nway through trackless forests to definite points; they may never have\r\npassed straight between the two particular points before, but they\r\nare well acquainted with the vicinity of both, and have such a general\r\nknowledge of the whole country, its water system, its soil and its\r\nvegetation, that as they approach the point they are to reach, many\r\neasily-recognised indications enable them to hit upon it with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of this forest was the abundance of rattan palms\r\nhanging from the trees, and turning and twisting about on the ground,\r\noften in inextricable confusion. One wonders at first how they can get\r\ninto such queer shapes; but it is evidently caused by the decay and fall\r\nof the trees up which they have first climbed, after which they grow\r\nalong the ground until they meet with another trunk up which to ascend.\r\nA tangled mass of twisted living rattan, is therefore, a sign that at\r\nsome former period a large tree has fallen there, though there may be\r\nnot the slightest vestige of it left. The rattan seems to have unlimited\r\npowers of growth, and a single plant may mount up several trees in\r\nsuccession, and thus reach the enormous length they are said sometimes\r\nto attain. They much improve the appearance of a forest as seen from the\r\ncoast; for they vary the otherwise monotonous tree-tops with feathery\r\ncrowns of leaves rising clear above them, and each terminated by an\r\nerect leafy spike like a lightning-conductor.\r\n\r\nThe other most interesting object in the forest was a beautiful palm,\r\nwhose perfectly smooth and cylindrical stem rises erect to more than a\r\nhundred feet high, with a thickness of only eight or ten inches; while\r\nthe fan-shaped leaves which compose its crown, are almost complete\r\ncircles of six or eight feet diameter, borne aloft on long and slender\r\npetioles, and beautifully toothed round the edge by the extremities\r\nof the leaflets, which are separated only for a few inches from the\r\ncircumference. It is probably the Livistona rotundifolia of botanists,\r\nand is the most complete and beautiful fan-leaf I have ever seen,\r\nserving admirably for folding into water-buckets and impromptu baskets,\r\nas well as for thatching and other purposes.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I returned to Menado on horse-back, sending my\r\nbaggage around by sea; and had just time to pack up all my collections\r\nto go by the next mail steamer to Amboyna. I will now devote a few pages\r\nto an account of the chief peculiarities of the Zoology of Celebes, and\r\nits relation to that of the surrounding countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. NATURAL HISTORY OF CELEBES.\r\n\r\nTHE position of Celebes is the most central in the Archipelago.\r\nImmediately to the north are the Philippine islands; on the west is\r\nBorneo; on the east are the Molucca islands; and on the south is the\r\nTimor group--and it is on all sides so connected with these islands by\r\nits own satellites, by small islets, and by coral reefs, that neither by\r\ninspection on the map nor by actual observation around its coast, is it\r\npossible to determine accurately which should be grouped with it, and\r\nwhich with the surrounding districts. Such being the case, we should\r\nnaturally expect to find that the productions of this central island\r\nin some degree represented the richness and variety of the whole\r\nArchipelago, while we should not expect much individuality in a country,\r\nso situated, that it would seem as if it were pre-eminently fitted to\r\nreceive stragglers and immigrants from all around.\r\n\r\nAs so often happens in nature, however, the fact turns out to be just\r\nthe reverse of what we should have expected; and an examination of its\r\nanimal productions shows Celebes to be at once the poorest in the\r\nnumber of its species, and the most isolated in the character of its\r\nproductions, of all the great islands in the Archipelago. With its\r\nattendant islets it spreads over an extent of sea hardly inferior in\r\nlength and breadth to that occupied by Borneo, while its actual land\r\narea is nearly double that of Java; yet its Mammalia and terrestrial\r\nbirds number scarcely more than half the species found in the last-named\r\nisland. Its position is such that it could receive immigrants from every\r\nside more readily than Java, yet in proportion to the species which\r\ninhabit it, far fewer seem derived from other islands, while far more\r\nare altogether peculiar to it; and a considerable number of its animal\r\nforms are so remarkable, as to find no close allies in any other part of\r\nthe world. I now propose to examine the best known groups of Celebesian\r\nanimals in some detail, to study their relations to those of other\r\nislands, and to call attention to the many points of interest which they\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\nWe know far more of the birds of Celebes than we do of any other group\r\nof animals. No less than 191 species have been discovered, and though\r\nno doubt, many more wading and swimming birds have to be added; yet the\r\nlist of land birds, 144 in number, and which for our present purpose\r\nare much the most important, must be very nearly complete. I myself\r\nassiduously collected birds in Celebes for nearly ten months, and my\r\nassistant, Mr. Allen, spent two months in the Sula islands. The Dutch\r\nnaturalist Forsten spent two years in Northern Celebes (twenty years\r\nbefore my visit), and collections of birds had also been sent to Holland\r\nfrom Macassar. The French ship of discovery, L'Astrolabe, also touched\r\nat Menado and procured collections. Since my return home, the Dutch\r\nnaturalists Rosenberg and Bernstein have made extensive collections\r\nboth in North Celebes and in the Sula islands; yet all their researches\r\ncombined have only added eight species of land birds to those forming\r\npart of my own collection--a fact which renders it almost certain that\r\nthere are very few more to discover.\r\n\r\nBesides Salayer and Boutong on the south, with Peling and Bungay on the\r\neast, the three islands of the Sula (or Zula) Archipelago also belong\r\nzoologically to Celebes, although their position is such that it would\r\nseem more natural to group them with the Moluccas. About 48 land birds\r\nare now known from the Sula group, and if we reject from these, five\r\nspecies which have a wide range over the Archipelago, the remainder are\r\nmuch more characteristic of Celebes than of the Moluccas. Thirty-one\r\nspecies are identical with those of the former island, and four are\r\nrepresentatives of Celebes forms, while only eleven are Moluccan\r\nspecies, and two more representatives.\r\n\r\nBut although the Sula islands belong to Celebes, they are so close to\r\nBouru and the southern islands of the Gilolo group, that several purely\r\nMoluccan forms have migrated there, which are quite unknown to the\r\nisland of Celebes itself; the whole thirteen Moluccan species being\r\nin this category, thus adding to the productions of Celebes a\r\nforeign element which does not really belong to it. In studying the\r\npeculiarities of the Celebesian fauna, it will therefore be well to\r\nconsider only the productions of the main island.\r\n\r\nThe number of land birds in the island of Celebes is 128, and from these\r\nwe may, as before, strike out a small number of species which roam\r\nover the whole Archipelago (often from India to the Pacific), and\r\nwhich therefore only serve to disguise the peculiarities of individual\r\nislands. These are 20 in number, and leave 108 species which we may\r\nconsider as more especially characteristic of the island. On accurately\r\ncomparing these with the birds of all the surrounding countries, we find\r\nthat only nine extend into the islands westward, and nineteen into the\r\nislands eastward, while no less than 80 are entirely confined to the\r\nCelebesian fauna--a degree of individuality which, considering the\r\nsituation of the island, is hardly to be equalled in any other part of\r\nthe world. If we still more closely examine these 80 species, we shall\r\nbe struck by the many peculiarities of structure they present, and by\r\nthe curious affinities with distant parts of the world which many\r\nof them seem to indicate. These points are of so much interest and\r\nimportance that it will be necessary to pass in review all those species\r\nwhich are peculiar to the island, and to call attention to whatever is\r\nmost worthy of remark.\r\n\r\nSix species of the Hawk tribe are peculiar to Celebes; three of these\r\nare very distinct from allied birds which range over all India to Java\r\nand Borneo, and which thus seem to be suddenly changed on entering\r\nCelebes. Another (Accipiter trinotatus) is a beautiful hawk, with\r\nelegant rows of large round white spots on the tail, rendering it very\r\nconspicuous and quite different from any other known bird of the family.\r\nThree owls are also peculiar; and one, a barn owl (Strix rosenbergii),\r\nis very much larger and stronger than its ally Strix javanica, which\r\nranges from India through all the islands as far as Lombock.\r\n\r\nOf the ten Parrots found in Celebes, eight are peculiar. Among them are\r\ntwo species of the singular racquet-tailed parrots forming the genus\r\nPrioniturus, and which are characterised by possessing two long\r\nspoon-shaped feathers in the tail. Two allied species are found in the\r\nadjacent island of Mindanao, one of the Philippines, and this form of\r\ntail is found in no other parrots in the whole world. A small species of\r\nLorikeet (Trichoglossus flavoviridis) seems to have its nearest ally in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe three Woodpeckers which inhabit the island are all peculiar, and are\r\nallied to species found in Java and Borneo, although very different from\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nAmong the three peculiar Cuckoos, two are very remarkable. Phoenicophaus\r\ncallirhynchus is the largest and handsomest species of its genus, and is\r\ndistinguished by the three colours of its beak, bright yellow, red, and\r\nblack. Eudynamis melanorynchus differs from all its allies in having a\r\njet-black bill, whereas the other species of the genus always have it\r\ngreen, yellow, or reddish.\r\n\r\nThe Celebes Roller (Coracias temmincki) is an interesting example of\r\none species of a genus being cut off from the rest. There are species of\r\nCoracias in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but none in the Malay peninsula,\r\nSumatra, Java, or Borneo. The present species seems therefore quite out\r\nof place; and what is still more curious is the fact that it is not at\r\nall like any of the Asiatic species, but seems more to resemble those of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nIn the next family, the Bee-eaters, is another equally isolated bird,\r\nMeropogon forsteni, which combines the characters of African and Indian\r\nBee-eaters, and whose only near ally, Meropogon breweri, was discovered\r\nby M. Du Chaillu in West Africa!\r\n\r\nThe two Celebes Hornbills have no close allies in those which abound in\r\nthe surrounding countries. The only Thrush, Geocichla erythronota,\r\nis most nearly allied to a species peculiar to Timor. Two of the\r\nFlycatchers are closely allied to Indian species, which are not found\r\nin the Malay islands. Two genera somewhat allied to the Magpies\r\n(Streptocitta and Charitornis), but whose affinities are so doubtful\r\nthat Professor Schlegel places them among the Starlings, are entirely\r\nconfined to Celebes. They are beautiful long-tailed birds, with black\r\nand white plumage, and with the feathers of the head somewhat rigid and\r\nscale-like.\r\n\r\nDoubtfully allied to the Starlings are two other very isolated and\r\nbeautiful birds. One, Enodes erythrophrys, has ashy and yellow plumage,\r\nbut is ornamented with broad stripes of orange-red above the eyes. The\r\nother, Basilornis celebensis, is a blue-black bird with a white patch\r\non each side of the breast, and the head ornamented with a beautiful\r\ncompressed scaly crest of feathers, resembling in form that of the\r\nwell-known Cock-of-the-rock of South America. The only ally to this bird\r\nis found in Ceram, and has the feathers of the crest elongated upwards\r\ninto quite a different form.\r\n\r\nA still more curious bird is the Scissirostrum pagei, which although\r\nit is at present classed in the Starling family, differs from all other\r\nspecies in the form of the bill and nostrils, and seems most nearly\r\nallied in its general structure to the Ox-peckers (Buphaga) of tropical\r\nAfrica, next to which the celebrated ornithologist Prince Bonaparte\r\nfinally placed it. It is almost entirely of a slatey colour, with yellow\r\nbill and feet, but the feathers of the rump and upper tail-coverts each\r\nterminate in a rigid, glossy pencil or tuft of a vivid crimson. These\r\npretty little birds take the place of the metallic-green starlings\r\nof the genus Calornis, which are found in most other islands of the\r\nArchipelago, but which are absent from Celebes. They go in flocks,\r\nfeeding upon grain and fruits, often frequenting dead trees, in holes of\r\nwhich they build their nests; and they cling to the trunks as easily as\r\nwoodpeckers or creepers.\r\n\r\nOut of eighteen Pigeons found in Celebes, eleven are peculiar to it. Two\r\nof them, Ptilonopus gularis and Turacaena menadensis, have their\r\nnearest allies in Timor. Two others, Carpophaga forsteni and Phlaegenas\r\ntristigmata, most resemble Philippine island species; and Carpophaga\r\nradiata belongs to a New Guinea group. Lastly, in the Gallinaceous\r\ntribe, the curious helmeted Maleo (Megacephalon rubripes) is quite\r\nisolated, having its nearest (but still distant) allies in the\r\nBrush-turkeys of Australia and New Guinea.\r\n\r\nJudging, therefore, by the opinions of the eminent naturalists who have\r\ndescribed and classified its birds, we find that many of the species\r\nhave no near allies whatsoever in the countries which surround Celebes,\r\nbut are either quite isolated, or indicate relations with such distant\r\nregions as New Guinea, Australia, India, or Africa. Other cases of\r\nsimilar remote affinities between the productions of distant countries\r\nno doubt exist, but in no spot upon the globe that I am yet acquainted\r\nwith, do so many of them occur together, or do they form so decided a\r\nfeature in the natural history of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Mammalia of Celebes are very few in number, consisting of fourteen\r\nterrestrial species and seven bats. Of the former no less than eleven\r\nare peculiar, including two which there is reason to believe may have\r\nbeen recently carried into other islands by man. Three species which\r\nhave a tolerably wide range in the Archipelago, are: (1) The curious\r\nLemur, Tarsius spectrum, which is found in all the islands as far\r\nwestward as Malacca; (2) the common Malay Civet, Viverra tangalunga,\r\nwhich has a still wider range; and (3) a Deer, which seems to be the\r\nsame as the Rusa hippelaphus of Java, and was probably introduced by man\r\nat an early period.\r\n\r\nThe more characteristic species are as follow:\r\n\r\nCynopithecus nigrescens, a curious baboon-like monkey if not a true\r\nbaboon, which abounds all over Celebes, and is found nowhere else but\r\nin the one small island of Batchian, into which it has probably been\r\nintroduced accidentally. An allied species is found in the Philippines,\r\nbut in no other island of the Archipelago is there anything resembling\r\nthem. These creatures are about the size of a spaniel, of a jet-black\r\ncolour, and have the projecting dog-like muzzle and overhanging brows\r\nof the baboons. They have large red callosities and a short fleshy tail,\r\nscarcely an inch long and hardly visible. They go in large bands, living\r\nchiefly in the trees, but often descending on the ground and robbing\r\ngardens and orchards.\r\n\r\nAnoa depressicornis, the Sapi-utan, or wild cow of the Malays, is an\r\nanimal which has been the cause of much controversy, as to whether it\r\nshould be classed as ox, buffalo, or antelope. It is smaller than any\r\nother wild cattle, and in many respects seems to approach some of the\r\nox-like antelopes of Africa. It is found only in the mountains, and\r\nis said never to inhabit places where there are deer. It is somewhat\r\nsmaller than a small Highland cow, and has long straight horns, which\r\nare ringed at the base and slope backwards over the neck.\r\n\r\nThe wild pig seems to be of a species peculiar to the island; but a much\r\nmore curious animal of this family is the Babirusa or Pig-deer; so\r\nnamed by the Malays from its long and slender legs, and curved tusks\r\nresembling horns. This extraordinary creature resembles a pig in general\r\nappearance, but it does not dig with its snout, as it feeds on fallen\r\nfruits. The tusks of the lower jaw are very long and sharp, but the\r\nupper ones instead of growing downwards in the usual way are completely\r\nreversed, growing upwards out of bony sockets through the skin on\r\neach side of the snout, curving backwards to near the eyes, and in old\r\nanimals often reaching eight or ten inches in length. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand what can be the use of these extraordinary horn-like teeth.\r\nSome of the old writers supposed that they served as hooks, by which\r\nthe creature could rest its head on a branch. But the way in which they\r\nusually diverge just over and in front of the eye has suggested the more\r\nprobable idea, that they serve to guard these organs from thorns and\r\nspines, while hunting for fallen fruits among the tangled thickets of\r\nrattans and other spiny plants. Even this, however, is not satisfactory,\r\nfor the female, who must seek her food in the same way, does not possess\r\nthem. I should be inclined to believe rather, that these tusks were once\r\nuseful, and were then worn down as fast as they grew; but that changed\r\nconditions of life have rendered them unnecessary, and they now develop\r\ninto a monstrous form, just as the incisors of the Beaver or Rabbit\r\nwill go on growing, if the opposite teeth do not wear them away. In old\r\nanimals they reach an enormous size, and are generally broken off as if\r\nby fighting.\r\n\r\nHere again we have a resemblance to the Wart-hogs of Africa, whose upper\r\ncanines grow outwards and curve up so as to form a transition from the\r\nusual mode of growth to that of the Babirusa. In other respects there\r\nseems no affinity between these animals, and the Babirusa stands\r\ncompletely isolated, having no resemblance to the pigs of any other part\r\nof the world. It is found all over Celebes and in the Sula islands,\r\nand also in Bourn, the only spot beyond the Celebes group to which it\r\nextends; and which island also shows some affinity to the Sula islands\r\nin its birds, indicating perhaps, a closer connection between them at\r\nsome former period than now exists.\r\n\r\nThe other terrestrial mammals of Celebes are five species of squirrels,\r\nwhich are all distinct from those of Java and Borneo, and mark the\r\nfurthest eastward range of the genus in the tropics; and two of Eastern\r\nopossums (Cuscus), which are different from those of the Moluccas, and\r\nmark the furthest westward extension of this genus and of the Marsupial\r\norder. Thus we see that the Mammalia of Celebes are no less individual\r\nand remarkable than the birds, since three of the largest and most\r\ninteresting species have no near allies in surrounding countries, but\r\nseem vaguely to indicate a relation to the African continent.\r\n\r\nMany groups of insects appear to be especially subject to local\r\ninfluences, their forms and colours changing with each change of\r\nconditions, or even with a change of locality where the conditions seem\r\nalmost identical. We should therefore anticipate that the individuality\r\nmanifested in the higher animals would be still more prominent in these\r\ncreatures with less stable organisms. On the other hand, however, we\r\nhave to consider that the dispersion and migration of insects is much\r\nmore easily effected than that of mammals or even of birds. They are\r\nmuch more likely to be carried away by violent winds; their eggs may\r\nbe carried on leaves either by storms of wind or by floating trees, and\r\ntheir larvae and pupae, often buried in trunks of trees or enclosed in\r\nwaterproof cocoons, may be floated for days or weeks uninjured over\r\nthe ocean. These facilities of distribution tend to assimilate the\r\nproductions of adjacent lands in two ways: first, by direct mutual\r\ninterchange of species; and secondly, by repeated immigrations of\r\nfresh individuals of a species common to other islands, which by\r\nintercrossing, tend to obliterate the changes of form and colour, which\r\ndifferences of conditions might otherwise produce. Bearing these facts\r\nin mind, we shall find that the individuality of the insects of Celebes\r\nis even greater than we have any reason to expect.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of insuring accuracy in comparisons with other islands,\r\nI shall confine myself to those groups which are best known, or which\r\nI have myself carefully studied. Beginning with the Papilionidae or\r\nSwallow-tailed butterflies, Celebes possesses 24 species, of which the\r\nlarge number of 18 are not found in any other island. If we compare this\r\nwith Borneo, which out of 29 species has only two not found elsewhere,\r\nthe difference is as striking as anything can be. In the family of the\r\nPieridae, or white butterflies, the difference is not quite so great,\r\nowing perhaps to the more wandering habits of the group; but it is still\r\nvery remarkable. Out of 30 species inhabiting Celebes, 19 are peculiar,\r\nwhile Java (from which more species are known than from Sumatra or\r\nBorneo), out of 37 species, has only 13 peculiar. The Danaidae are\r\nlarge, but weak-flying butterflies, which frequent forests and gardens,\r\nand are plainly but often very richly coloured. Of these my own\r\ncollection contains 16 species from Celebes and 15 from Borneo; but\r\nwhereas no less than 14 are confined to the former island, only two are\r\npeculiar to the latter. The Nymphalidae are a very extensive group,\r\nof generally strong-winged and very bright-coloured butterflies, very\r\nabundant in the tropics, and represented in our own country by our\r\nFritillaries, our Vanessas, and our Purple-emperor. Some months ago I\r\ndrew up a list of the Eastern species of this group, including all the\r\nnew ones discovered by myself, and arrived at the following comparative\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                Species of  Species peculiar to      Percentage\r\n               Nymphalidae.    each island.     of peculiar Species.\r\n\r\n     Java.....     70......           23..........        33\r\n     Borneo....    52......           15..........        29\r\n     Celebes ...   48......           35..........        73\r\n\r\nThe Coleoptera are so extensive that few of the groups have yet been\r\ncarefully worked out. I will therefore refer to one only, which I have\r\nmyself recently studied--the Cetoniadae or Rose-chafers--a group of\r\nbeetles which, owing to their extreme beauty, have been much sought\r\nafter. From Java 37 species of these insects are known, and from Celebes\r\nonly 30; yet only 13, or 35 percent, are peculiar to the former island,\r\nand 19, or 63 percent, to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe result of these comparisons is, that although Celebes is a single,\r\nlarge island with only a few smaller ones closely grouped around it,\r\nwe must really consider it as forming one of the great divisions of the\r\nArchipelago, equal in rank and importance to the whole of the Moluccan\r\nor Philippine groups, to the Papuan islands, or to the Indo-Malay\r\nislands (Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay peninsula). Taking those\r\nfamilies of insects and birds which are best known, the following table\r\nshows the comparison of Celebes with the other groups of islands:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PAPILIONIDAE AND    HAWKS, PARROTS, AND\r\n                            PERIDAE               PIGEONS.\r\n                       Percent of peculiar   Percent of peculiar\r\n                            Species.

It is most strongly manifested in the\r\nPapilios and the Pieridae, and consists in the forewings being either\r\nstrongly curved or abruptly bent near the base, or in the extremity\r\nbeing elongated and often somewhat hooked. Out of the 14 species of\r\nPapilio in Celebes, 13 exhibit this peculiarity in a greater or less\r\ndegree, when compared with the most nearly allied species of the\r\nsurrounding islands. Ten species of Pieridae have the same character,\r\nand in four or five of the Nymphalidae it is also very distinctly\r\nmarked. In almost every case, the species found in Celebes are much\r\nlarger than those of the islands westward, and at least equal to those\r\nof the Moluccas, or even larger. The difference of form is, however, the\r\nmost remarkable feature, as it is altogether a new thing for a whole\r\nset of species in one country to differ in exactly the same way from the\r\ncorresponding sets in all the surrounding countries; and it is so well\r\nmarked, that without looking at the details of colouring, most Celebes\r\nPapilios and many Pieridae, can be at once distinguished from those of\r\nother islands by their form alone.\r\n\r\nThe outside figure of each pair here given, shows the exact size and\r\nform of the fore-wing in a butterfly of Celebes, while the inner one\r\nrepresents the most closely allied species from one of the adjacent\r\nislands. Figure 1 shows the strongly curved margin of the Celebes\r\nspecies, Papilio gigon, compared with the much straighter margin of\r\nPapilio demolion from Singapore and Java. Figure 2 shows the abrupt bend\r\nover the base of the wing in Papilio miletus of Celebes, compared with\r\nthe slight curvature in the common Papilio sarpedon, which has almost\r\nexactly the same form from India to New Guinea and Australia. Figure\r\n3 shows the elongated wing of Tachyris zarinda, a native of Celebes,\r\ncompared with the much shorter wing of Tachyris nero, a very closely\r\nallied species found in all the western islands. The difference of form\r\nis in each case sufficiently obvious, but when the insects themselves\r\nare compared, it is much more striking than in these partial outlines.\r\n\r\nFrom the analogy of birds, we should suppose that the pointed wing\r\ngave increased rapidity of flight, since it is a character of terns,\r\nswallows, falcons, and of the swift-flying pigeons. A short and rounded\r\nwing, on the other hand, always accompanies a more feeble or more\r\nlaborious flight, and one much less under command. We might suppose,\r\ntherefore, that the butterflies which possess this peculiar form were\r\nbetter able to escape pursuit. But there seems no unusual abundance of\r\ninsectivorous birds to render this necessary; and as we cannot believe\r\nthat such a curious peculiarity is without meaning, it seems probable\r\nthat it is the result of a former condition of things, when the island\r\npossessed a much richer fauna, the relics of which we see in the\r\nisolated birds and Mammalia now inhabiting it; and when the abundance\r\nof insectivorous creatures rendered some unusual means of escape\r\na necessity for the large-winged and showy butterflies. It is some\r\nconfirmation of this view, that neither the very small nor the very\r\nobscurely coloured groups of butterflies have elongated wings, nor is\r\nany modification perceptible in those strong-winged groups which already\r\npossess great strength and rapidity of flight. These were already\r\nsufficiently protected from their enemies, and did not require increased\r\npower of escaping from them. It is not at all clear what effect the\r\npeculiar curvature of the wings has in modifying flight.\r\n\r\nAnother curious feature in the zoology of Celebes is also worthy of\r\nattention. I allude to the absence of several groups which are found on\r\nboth sides of it, in the Indo-Malay islands as well as in the Moluccas;\r\nand which thus seem to be unable, from some unknown cause, to obtain a\r\nfooting in the intervening island. In Birds we have the two families of\r\nPodargidae and Laniadae, which range over the whole Archipelago and into\r\nAustralia, and which yet have no representative in Celebes. The genera\r\nCeyx among Kingfishers, Criniger among Thrushes, Rhipidura among\r\nFlycatchers, Calornis among Starlings, and Erythrura among Finches,\r\nare all found in the Moluccas as well as in Borneo and Java--but not a\r\nsingle species belonging to any one of them is found in Celebes. Among\r\ninsects, the large genus of Rose-chafers, Lomaptera, is found in every\r\ncountry and island between India and New Guinea, except Celebes. This\r\nunexpected absence of many groups, from one limited district in the very\r\ncentre of their area of distribution, is a phenomenon not altogether\r\nunique, but, I believe, nowhere so well marked as in this case; and it\r\ncertainly adds considerably to the strange character of this remarkable\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe anomalies and eccentricities in the natural history of Celebes which\r\nI have endeavoured to sketch in this CHAPTER, all point to an origin in\r\na remote antiquity. The history of extinct animals teaches us that their\r\ndistribution in time and in space are strikingly similar. The rule is,\r\nthat just as the productions of adjacent areas usually resemble each\r\nother closely, so do the productions of successive periods in the same\r\narea; and as the productions of remote areas generally differ widely, so\r\ndo the productions of the same area at remote epochs. We are therefore\r\nled irresistibly to the conclusion, that change of species, still more\r\nof generic and of family form, is a matter of time. But time may have\r\nled to a change of species in one country, while in another the forms\r\nhave been more permanent, or the change may have gone on at an equal\r\nrate but in a different manner in both. In either case, the amount of\r\nindividuality in the productions of a district will be to some extent\r\na measure of the time that a district has been isolated from those that\r\nsurround it. Judged by this standard, Celebes must be one of the oldest\r\nparts of the Archipelago. It probably dates from a period not only\r\nanterior to that when Borneo, Java, and Sumatra were separated from the\r\ncontinent, but from that still more remote epoch when the land that now\r\nconstitutes these islands had not risen above the ocean.\r\n\r\nSuch an antiquity is necessary, to account for the number of animal\r\nforms it possesses, which show no relation to those of India or\r\nAustralia, but rather with those of Africa; and we are led to speculate\r\non the possibility of there having once existed a continent in the\r\nIndian Ocean which might serve as a bridge to connect these distant\r\ncountries. Now it is a curious fact, that the existence of such a land\r\nhas been already thought necessary, to account for the distribution\r\nof the curious Quadrumana forming the family of the Lemurs. These have\r\ntheir metropolis in Madagascar, but are found also in Africa, in Ceylon,\r\nin the peninsula of India, and in the Malay Archipelago as far as\r\nCelebes, which is its furthest eastern limit. Dr. Sclater has proposed\r\nfor the hypothetical continent connecting these distant points, and\r\nwhose former existence is indicated by the Mascarene islands and the\r\nMaldive coral group, the name of Lemuria. Whether or not we believe\r\nin its existence in the exact form here indicated, the student of\r\ngeographical distribution must see in the extraordinary and isolated\r\nproductions of Celebes, proof of the former existence of some continent\r\nfrom whence the ancestors of these creatures, and of many other\r\nintermediate forms, could have been derived.\r\n\r\nIn this short sketch of the most striking peculiarities of the Natural\r\nHistory of Celebes, I have been obliged to enter much into details that\r\nI fear will have been uninteresting to the general reader, but unless I\r\nhad done so, my exposition would have lost much of its force and value.\r\nIt is by these details alone that I have been able to prove the unusual\r\nfeatures that Celebes presents to us. Situated in the very midst of an\r\nArchipelago, and closely hemmed in on every side by islands teeming with\r\nvaried forms of life, its productions have yet a surprising amount of\r\nindividuality. While it is poor in the actual number of its species, it\r\nis yet wonderfully rich in peculiar forms, many of which are singular\r\nor beautiful, and are in some cases absolutely unique upon the globe. We\r\nbehold here the curious phenomenon of groups of insects changing their\r\noutline in a similar manner when compared with those of surrounding\r\nislands, suggesting some common cause which never seems to have acted\r\nelsewhere in exactly the same way. Celebes, therefore, presents us with\r\na most striking example of the interest that attaches to the study of\r\nthe geographical distribution of animals. We can see that their present\r\ndistribution upon the globe is the result of all the more recent changes\r\nthe earth's surface has undergone; and, by a careful study of the\r\nphenomena, we are sometimes able to deduce approximately what those past\r\nchanges must have been in order to produce the distribution we find to\r\nexist. In the comparatively simple case of the Timor group, we were able\r\nto deduce these changes with some approach to certainty. In the much\r\nmore complicated case of Celebes, we can only indicate their general\r\nnature, since we now see the result, not of any single or recent change\r\nonly, but of a whole series of the later revolutions which have resulted\r\nin the present distribution of land in the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. BANDA.\r\n\r\n (DECEMBER 1857, MAY 1859, APRIL 1861.)\r\n\r\nTHE Dutch mail steamer in which I travelled from Macassar to Banda and\r\nAmboyna was a roomy and comfortable vessel, although it would only\r\ngo six miles an hour in the finest weather. As there were but three\r\npassengers besides myself, we had abundance of room, and I was able to\r\nenjoy a voyage more than I had ever done before. The arrangements are\r\nsomewhat different from those on board English or Indian steamers. There\r\nare no cabin servants, as every cabin passenger invariably brings his\r\nown, and the ship's stewards attend only to the saloon and the eating\r\ndepartment. At six A.M. a cup of tea or coffee is provided for those\r\nwho like it. At seven to eight there is a light breakfast of tea, eggs,\r\nsardines, etc. At ten, Madeira, Gin and bitters are brought on deck as a\r\nwhet for the substantial eleven o'clock breakfast, which differs from a\r\ndinner only in the absence of soup. Cups of tea and coffee are brought\r\naround at three P.M.; bitters, etc. again at five, a good dinner with\r\nbeer and claret at half-past six, concluded by tea and coffee at eight.\r\nBetween whiles, beer and sodawater are supplied when called for, so\r\nthere is no lack of little gastronomical excitements to while away the\r\ntedium of a sea voyage.\r\n\r\nOur first stopping place was Coupang, at the west end of the large\r\nisland of Timor. We then coasted along that island for several hundred\r\nmiles, having always a view of hilly ranges covered with scanty\r\nvegetation, rising ridge behind ridge to the height of six or seven\r\nthousand feet. Turning off towards Banda we passed Pulo-Cambing, Wetter,\r\nand Roma, all of which are desolate and barren volcanic islands, almost\r\nas uninviting as Aden, and offering a strange contrast to the usual\r\nverdure and luxuriance of the Archipelago. In two days more we reached\r\nthe volcanic group of Banda, covered with an unusually dense and\r\nbrilliant green vegetation, indicating that we had passed beyond the\r\nrange of the hot dry winds from the plains of Central Australia. Banda\r\nis a lovely little spot, its three islands enclosing a secure harbour\r\nfrom whence no outlet is visible, and with water so transparent, that\r\nliving corals and even the minutest objects are plainly seen on the\r\nvolcanic sand at a depth of seven or eight fathoms. The ever smoking\r\nvolcano rears its bare cone on one side, while the two larger islands\r\nare clothed with vegetation to the summit of the hills.\r\n\r\nGoing on shore, I walked up a pretty path which leads to the highest\r\npoint of the island on which the town is situated, where there is a\r\ntelegraph station and a magnificent view. Below lies the little town,\r\nwith its neat red-tiled white houses and the thatched cottages of the\r\nnatives, bounded on one side by the old Portuguese fort. Beyond, about\r\nhalf a mile distant, lies the larger island in the shape of a horseshoe,\r\nformed of a range of abrupt hills covered with fine forest and nutmeg\r\ngardens; while close opposite the town is the volcano, forming a nearly\r\nperfect cone, the lower part only covered with a light green bushy\r\nvegetation. On its north side the outline is more uneven, and there is\r\na slight hollow or chasm about one-fifth of the way down, from which\r\nconstantly issue two columns of smoke, as well as a good deal from the\r\nrugged surface around and from some spots nearer the summit. A white\r\nefflorescence, probably sulphur, is thickly spread over the upper part\r\nof the mountain, marked by the narrow black vertical lines of water\r\ngullies. The smoke unites as it rises, and forms a dense cloud, which in\r\ncalm, damp weather spreads out into a wide canopy hiding the top of the\r\nmountain. At night and early morning, it often rises up straight and\r\nleaves the whole outline clear.\r\n\r\nIt is only when actually gazing on an active volcano that one can fully\r\nrealize its awfulness and grandeur. Whence comes that inexhaustible\r\nfire whose dense and sulphurous smoke forever issues from this bare and\r\ndesolate peak? Whence the mighty forces that produced that peak, and\r\nstill from time to time exhibit themselves in the earthquakes that\r\nalways occur in the vicinity of volcanic vents? The knowledge from\r\nchildhood of the fact that volcanoes and earthquakes exist, has taken\r\naway somewhat of the strange and exceptional character that really\r\nbelongs to them. The inhabitant of most parts of northern Europe sees in\r\nthe earth the emblem of stability and repose. His whole life-experience,\r\nand that of all his age and generation, teaches him that the earth is\r\nsolid and firm, that its massive rocks may contain water in abundance,\r\nbut never fire; and these essential characteristics of the earth are\r\nmanifest in every mountain his country contains. A volcano is a fact\r\nopposed to all this mass of experience, a fact of so awful a character\r\nthat, if it were the rule instead of the exception, it would make the\r\nearth uninhabitable a fact so strange and unaccountable that we may be\r\nsure it would not be believed on any human testimony, if presented to us\r\nnow for the first time, as a natural phenomenon happening in a distant\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the small island is composed of a highly crystalline\r\nbasalt; lower down I found a hard, stratified slatey sandstone, while\r\non the beach are huge blocks of lava, and scattered masses of white\r\ncoralline limestone. The larger island has coral rock to a height of\r\nthree or four hundred feet, while above is lava and basalt. It seems\r\nprobable, therefore, that this little group of four islands is the\r\nfragment of a larger district which was perhaps once connected with\r\nCeram, but which was separated and broken up by the same forces which\r\nformed the volcanic cone. When I visited the larger island on another\r\noccasion, I saw a considerable tract covered with large forest\r\ntrees--dead, but still standing. This was a record of the last great\r\nearthquake only two years ago, when the sea broke in over this part of\r\nthe island and so flooded it as to destroy the vegetation on all\r\nthe lowlands. Almost every year there is an earthquake here, and at\r\nintervals of a few years, very severe ones which throw down houses and\r\ncarry ships out of the harbour bodily into the streets.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the losses incurred by these terrific visitations, and\r\nthe small size and isolated position of these little islands, they have\r\nbeen and still are of considerable value to the Dutch Government, as the\r\nchief nutmeg-garden in the world. Almost the whole surface is planted\r\nwith nutmegs, grown under the shade of lofty Kanary trees (Kanarium\r\ncommune). The light volcanic soil, the shade, and the excessive moisture\r\nof these islands, where it rains more or less every month in the year,\r\nseem exactly to suit the nutmeg-tree, which requires no manure and\r\nscarcely any attention. All the year round flowers and ripe fruit are\r\nto be found, and none of those diseases occur which under a forced\r\nand unnatural system of cultivation have ruined the nutmeg planters of\r\nSingapore and Penang.\r\n\r\nFew cultivated plants are more beautiful than nutmeg-trees. They are\r\nhandsomely shaped and glossy-leaved, growing to the height of twenty or\r\nthirty feet, and bearing small yellowish flowers. The fruit is the\r\nsize and colour of a peach, but rather oval. It is of a tough fleshy\r\nconsistence, but when ripe splits open, and shows the dark-brown nut\r\nwithin, covered with the crimson mace, and is then a most beautiful\r\nobject. Within the thin, hard shell of the nut is the seed, which is the\r\nnutmeg of commerce. The nuts are eaten by the large pigeons of Banda,\r\nwhich digest the mace, but cast up the nut with its seed uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg trade has hitherto been a strict monopoly of the Dutch\r\nGovernment; but since leaving the country I believe that this monopoly\r\nhas been partially or wholly discontinued, a proceeding which appears\r\nexceedingly injudicious and quite unnecessary. There are cases in which\r\nmonopolies are perfectly justifiable, and I believe this to be one of\r\nthem. A small country like Holland cannot afford to keep distant and\r\nexpensive colonies at a loss; and having possession of a very small\r\nisland where a valuable product, not a necessity of life, can be\r\nobtained at little cost, it is almost the duty of the state to\r\nmonopolise it. No injury is done thereby to anyone, but a great benefit\r\nis conferred upon the whole population of Holland and its dependencies,\r\nsince the produce of the state monopolies saves them from the weight of\r\na heavy taxation. Had the Government not kept the nutmeg trade of Banda\r\nin its own hands, it is probable that the whole of the islands would\r\nlong ago have become the property of one or more large capitalists. The\r\nmonopoly would have been almost the same, since no known spot on the\r\nglobe can produce nutmegs so cheaply as Banda, but the profits of the\r\nmonopoly would have gone to a few individuals instead of to the nation.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of how a state monopoly may become a state duty, let\r\nus suppose that no gold existed in Australia, but that it had been\r\nfound in immense quantities by one of our ships in some small and barren\r\nisland. In this case it would plainly become the duty of the state to\r\nkeep and work the mines for the public benefit, since by doing so, the\r\ngain would be fairly divided among the whole population by decrease of\r\ntaxation; whereas by leaving it open to free trade while merely keeping\r\nthe government of the island; we should certainly produce enormous evils\r\nduring the first struggle for the precious metal, and should ultimately\r\nsubside into the monopoly of some wealthy individual or great company,\r\nwhose enormous revenue would not equally benefit the community. The\r\nnutmegs of Banda and the tin of Banca are to some extent parallel cases\r\nto this supposititious one, and I believe the Dutch Government will act\r\nmost unwisely if they give up their monopoly.\r\n\r\nEven the destruction of the nutmeg and clove trees in many islands, in\r\norder to restrict their cultivation to one or two where the monopoly\r\ncould be easily guarded, usually made the theme of so much virtuous\r\nindignation against the Dutch, may be defended on similar principles,\r\nand is certainly not nearly so bad as many monopolies we ourselves have\r\nuntil very recently maintained. Nutmegs and cloves are not necessaries\r\nof life; they are not even used as spices by the natives of the\r\nMoluccas, and no one was materially or permanently injured by the\r\ndestruction of the trees, since there are a hundred other products\r\nthat can be grown in the same islands, equally valuable and far more\r\nbeneficial in a social point of view. It is a case exactly parallel\r\nto our prohibition of the growth of tobacco in England, for fiscal\r\npurposes, and is, morally and economically, neither better nor worse.\r\nThe salt monopoly which we so long maintained in India was in much\r\nworse. As long as we keep up a system of excise and customs on articles\r\nof daily use, which requires an elaborate array of officers and\r\ncoastguards to carry into effect, and which creates a number of purely\r\nlegal crimes, it is the height of absurdity for us to affect indignation\r\nat the conduct of the Dutch, who carried out a much more justifiable,\r\nless hurtful, and more profitable system in their Eastern possessions.\r\n\r\nI challenge objectors to point out any physical or moral evils that\r\nhave actually resulted from the action of the Dutch Government in this\r\nmatter; whereas such evils are the admitted results of every one of our\r\nmonopolies and restrictions. The conditions of the two experiments are\r\ntotally different. The true \"political economy\" of a higher race, when\r\ngoverning a lower race, has never yet been worked out. The application\r\nof our \"political economy\" to such cases invariably results in the\r\nextinction or degradation of the lower race; whence, we may consider\r\nit probable that one of the necessary conditions of its truth is the\r\napproximate mental and social unity of the society in which it is\r\napplied. I shall again refer to this subject in my CHAPTER on Ternate,\r\none of the most celebrated of the old spice-islands.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Banda are very much mixed, and it is probable that at\r\nleast three-fourths of the population are mongrels, in various degrees\r\nof Malay, Papuan, Arab, Portuguese, and Dutch. The first two form the\r\nbases of the larger portion, and the dark skins, pronounced features,\r\nand more or less frizzly hair of the Papuans preponderates. There seems\r\nlittle doubt that the aborigines of Banda were Papuans, and a portion\r\nof them still exists in the Ke islands, where they emigrated when the\r\nPortuguese first took possession of their native island. It is such\r\npeople as these that are often looked upon as transitional forms between\r\ntwo very distinct races, like the Malays and Papuans, whereas they are\r\nonly examples of intermixture.\r\n\r\nThe animal productions of Banda, though very few, are interesting. The\r\nislands have perhaps no truly indigenous Mammalia but bats. The deer\r\nof the Moluccas and the pig have probably been introduced. A species of\r\nCuscus or Eastern opossum is also found at Banda, and this may be truly\r\nindigenous in the sense of not having been introduced by man. Of birds,\r\nduring my three visits of one or two days each, I collected eight kinds,\r\nand the Dutch collectors have added a few others. The most remarkable is\r\na fine and very handsome fruit-pigeon, Carpophaga concinna, which feeds\r\nupon the nutmegs, or rather on the mace, and whose loud booming note\r\nis to be continually heard. This bird is found in the Ke and Matabello\r\nislands as well as Banda, but not in Ceram or any of the larger islands,\r\nwhich are inhabited by allied but very distinct species. A beautiful\r\nsmall fruit-dove, Ptilonopus diadematus, is also peculiar to Banda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. AMBOYNA.\r\n\r\n (DECEMBER 1857, OCTOBER 1859, FEBRUARY 1860.)\r\n\r\nTWENTY hours from Banda brought us to Amboyna, the capital of the\r\nMoluccas, and one of the oldest European settlements in the East. The\r\nisland consists of two peninsulas, so nearly divided by inlets of the\r\nsea, as to leave only a sandy isthmus about a mile wide near their\r\neastern extremity. The western inlet is several miles long and forms\r\na fine harbour on the southern side of which is situated the town\r\nof Amboyna. I had a letter of introduction to Dr. Mohnike, the chief\r\nmedical officer of the Moluccas, a German and a naturalist. I found\r\nthat he could write and read English, but could not speak it, being\r\nlike myself a bad linguist; so we had to use French as a medium of\r\ncommunication. He kindly offered me a room during my stay in Amboyna,\r\nand introduced me to his junior, Dr. Doleschall, a Hungarian and also an\r\nentomologist. He was an intelligent and most amiable young man but I was\r\nshocked to find that he was dying of consumption, though still able to\r\nperform the duties of his office. In the evening my host took me to the\r\nresidence of the Governor, Mr. Goldmann, who received me in a most kind\r\nand cordial manner, and offered me every assistance. The town of Amboyna\r\nconsists of a few business streets, and a number of roads set out at\r\nright angles to each other, bordered by hedges of flowering shrubs, and\r\nenclosing country houses and huts embossed in palms and fruit trees.\r\nHills and mountains form the background in almost every direction, and\r\nthere are few places more enjoyable for a morning or evening stroll than\r\nthese sandy roads and shady lanes in the suburbs of the ancient city of\r\nAmboyna.\r\n\r\nThere are no active volcanoes in the island, nor is it now subject to\r\nfrequent earthquakes, although very severe ones have occurred and may be\r\nexpected again. Mr. William Funnell, in his voyage with Dampier to the\r\nSouth Seas in 1705, says: \"Whilst we were here, (at Amboyna) we had a\r\ngreat earthquake, which continued two days, in which time it did a\r\ngreat deal of mischief, for the ground burst open in many places, and\r\nswallowed up several houses and whole families. Several of the people\r\nwere dug out again, but most of them dead, and many had their legs\r\nor arms broken by the fall of the houses. The castle walls were rent\r\nasunder in several places, and we thought that it and all the houses\r\nwould have fallen down. The ground where we were swelled like a wave\r\nin the sea, but near us we had no hurt done.\" There are also numerous\r\nrecords of eruptions of a volcano on the west side of the island.\r\nIn 1674 an eruption destroyed a village. In 1694 there was another\r\neruption. In 1797 much vapour and heat was emitted. Other eruptions\r\noccurred in 1816 and 1820, and in 1824 a new crater is said to have been\r\nformed. Yet so capricious is the action of these subterranean fires,\r\nthat since the last-named epoch all eruptive symptoms have so completely\r\nceased, that I was assured by many of the most intelligent European\r\ninhabitants of Amboyna, that they had never heard of any such thing as a\r\nvolcano on the island.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days that elapsed before I could make arrangements to\r\nvisit the interior, I enjoyed myself much in the society of the two\r\ndoctors, both amiable and well-educated men, and both enthusiastic\r\nentomologists, though obliged to increase their collections almost\r\nentirely by means of native collectors. Dr. Doleschall studied chiefly\r\nthe flies and spiders, but also collected butterflies and moths, and in\r\nhis boxes I saw grand specimens of the emerald Ornithoptera priamus and\r\nthe azure Papilio ulysses, with many more of the superb butterflies of\r\nthis rich island. Dr. Mohnike confined himself chiefly to the beetles,\r\nand had formed a magnificent collection during many years residence in\r\nJava, Sumatra, Borneo, Japan, and Amboyna. The Japanese collection was\r\nespecially interesting, containing both the fine Carabi of northern\r\ncountries, and the gorgeous Buprestidae and Longicorns of the tropics.\r\nThe doctor made the voyage to Jeddo by land from Nagasaki, and is well\r\nacquainted with the character, manners, and customs of the people of\r\nJapan, and with the geology, physical features, and natural history\r\nof the country. He showed me collections of cheap woodcuts printed in\r\ncolours, which are sold at less than a farthing each, and comprise an\r\nendless variety of sketches of Japanese scenery and manners. Though\r\nrude, they are very characteristic, and often exhibit touches of great\r\nhumour. He also possesses a large collection of coloured sketches of the\r\nplants of Japan, made by a Japanese lady, which are the most masterly\r\nthings I have ever seen. Every stem, twig, and leaf is produced by\r\nsingle touches of the brush, the character and perspective of very\r\ncomplicated plants being admirably given, and the articulations of stem\r\nand leaves shown in a most scientific manner.\r\n\r\nHaving made arrangements to stay for three weeks at a small hut on a\r\nnewly cleared plantation in the interior of the northern half of the\r\nisland, I with some difficulty obtained a boat and men to take me\r\nacross the water--for the Amboynese are dreadfully lazy. Passing up the\r\nharbour, in appearance like a fine river, the clearness of the water\r\nafforded me one of the most astonishing and beautiful sights I have\r\never beheld. The bottom was absolutely hidden by a continuous series of\r\ncorals, sponges, actiniae, and other marine productions of magnificent\r\ndimensions, varied forms, and brilliant colours. The depth varied from\r\nabout twenty to fifty feet, and the bottom was very uneven, rocks and\r\nchasms and little hills and valleys, offering a variety of stations for\r\nthe growth of these animal forests. In and out among them, moved numbers\r\nof blue and red and yellow fishes, spotted and banded and striped in\r\nthe most striking manner, while great orange or rosy transparent medusae\r\nfloated along near the surface. It was a sight to gaze at for hours, and\r\nno description can do justice to its surpassing beauty and interest. For\r\nonce, the reality exceeded the most glowing accounts I had ever read of\r\nthe wonders of a coral sea. There is perhaps no spot in the world richer\r\nin marine productions, corals, shells and fishes, than the harbour of\r\nAmboyna.\r\n\r\nFrom the north side of the harbour, a good broad path passes through\r\nswamp, clearing and forest, over hill and valley, to the farther side\r\nof the island; the coralline rock constantly protruding through the deep\r\nred earth which fills all the hollows, and is more or less spread over\r\nthe plains and hill-sides. The forest vegetation is here of the most\r\nluxuriant character; ferns and palms abound, and the climbing rattans\r\nwere more abundant than I had ever seen them, forming tangled festoons\r\nover almost every large forest tree. The cottage I was to occupy was\r\nsituated in a large clearing of about a hundred acres, part of which\r\nwas already planted with young cacao-trees and plantains to shade them,\r\nwhile the rest was covered with dead and half-burned forest trees; and\r\non one side there was a tract where the trees had been recently felled\r\nand were not yet burned. The path by which I had arrived continued along\r\none side of this clearing, and then again entering the virgin forest\r\npassed over hill and dale to the northern aide of the island.\r\n\r\nMy abode was merely a little thatched hut, consisting of an open\r\nverandah in front and a small dark sleeping room behind. It was raised\r\nabout five feet from the ground, and was reached by rude steps to the\r\ncentre of the verandah. The walls and floor were of bamboo, and it\r\ncontained a table, two bamboo chairs, and a couch. Here I soon made\r\nmyself comfortable, and set to work hunting for insects among the\r\nmore recently felled timber, which swarmed with fine Curculionidae,\r\nLongicorns, and Buprestidae, most of them remarkable for their elegant\r\nforms or brilliant colours, and almost all entirely new to me. Only the\r\nentomologist can appreciate the delight with which I hunted about for\r\nhours in the hot sunshine, among the branches and twigs and bark of the\r\nfallen trees, every few minutes securing insects which were at that time\r\nalmost all rare or new to European collections.\r\n\r\nIn the shady forest paths were many fine butterflies, most conspicuous\r\namong which was the shining blue Papilio ulysses, one of the princes of\r\nthe tribe, though at that time so rare in Europe, I found it absolutely\r\ncommon in Amboyna, though not easy to obtain in fine condition, a large\r\nnumber of the specimens being found when captured to have the wings torn\r\nor broken. It flies with a rather weak undulating motion, and from its\r\nlarge size, its tailed wings and brilliant colour, is one of the most\r\ntropical-looking insects the naturalist can gaze upon.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable contrast between the beetles of Amboyna and those\r\nof Macassar, the latter generally small and obscure, the former large\r\nand brilliant. On the whole, the insects here most resemble those of the\r\nAru islands, but they are almost always of distinct species, and when\r\nthey are most nearly allied to each other, the species of Amboyna are\r\nof larger size and more brilliant colours, so that one might be led to\r\nconclude that in passing east and west into a less favourable soil and\r\nclimate, they had degenerated into less striking forms.\r\n\r\nOf an evening I generally sat reading in the verandah, ready to capture\r\nany insects that were attracted to the light. One night about nine\r\no'clock, I heard a curious noise and rustling overhead, as if some heavy\r\nanimal were crawling slowly over the thatch. The noise soon ceased, and\r\nI thought no more about it and went to bed soon afterwards. The next\r\nafternoon just before dinner, being rather tired with my day's work, I\r\nwas lying on the couch with a book in my hand, when gazing upwards I\r\nsaw a large mass of something overhead which I had not noticed before.\r\nLooking more carefully I could see yellow and black marks, and thought\r\nit must be a tortoise-shell put up there out of the way between the\r\nridge-pole and the roof. Continuing to gaze, it suddenly resolved itself\r\ninto a large snake, compactly coiled up in a kind of knot; and I could\r\ndetect his head and his bright eyes in the very centre of the folds. The\r\nnoise of the evening before was now explained. A python had climbed up\r\none of the posts of the house, and had made his way under the thatch\r\nwithin a yard of my head, and taken up a comfortable position in the\r\nroof--and I had slept soundly all night directly under him.\r\n\r\nI called to my two boys who were skinning birds below and said, \"Here's\r\na big snake in the roof;\" but as soon as I had shown it to them they\r\nrushed out of the house and begged me to come out directly. Finding they\r\nwere too much afraid to do anything, we called some of the labourers in\r\nthe plantation, and soon had half a dozen men in consultation outside.\r\nOne of these, a native of Bouru, where there are a great many snakes,\r\nsaid he would get him out, and proceeded to work in a businesslike\r\nmanner. He made a strong noose of rattan, and with a long pole in the\r\nother hand poked at the snake, who then began slowly to uncoil itself.\r\nHe then managed to slip the noose over its head, and getting it well on\r\nto the body, dragged the animal down. There was a great scuffle as the\r\nsnake coiled round the chairs and posts to resist his enemy, but at\r\nlength the man caught hold of its tail, rushed out of the house (running\r\nso quick that the creature seemed quite confounded), and tried to strike\r\nits head against a tree. He missed however, and let go, and the snake\r\ngot under a dead trunk close by. It was again poked out, and again the\r\nBouru man caught hold of its tail, and running away quickly dashed its\r\nhead with a swing against a tree, and it was then easily killed with a\r\nhatchet. It was about twelve feet long and very thick, capable of doing\r\nmuch mischief and of swallowing a dog or a child.\r\n\r\nI did not get a great many birds here. The most remarkable were the fine\r\ncrimson lory, Eos rubra--a brush-tongued parroquet of a vivid crimson\r\ncolour, which was very abundant. Large flocks of them came about the\r\nplantation, and formed a magnificent object when they settled down upon\r\nsome flowering tree, on the nectar of which lories feed. I also obtained\r\none or two specimens of the fine racquet-tailed kingfisher of Amboyna,\r\nTanysiptera nais, one of the most singular and beautiful of that\r\nbeautiful family. These birds differ from all other kingfishers (which\r\nhave usually short tails) by having the two middle tail-feathers\r\nimmensely lengthened and very narrowly webbed, but terminated by\r\na spoon-shaped enlargement, as in the motmots and some of the\r\nhumming-birds. They belong to that division of the family termed\r\nking-hunters, living chiefly on insects and small land-molluscs, which\r\nthey dart down upon and pick up from the ground, just as a kingfisher\r\npicks a fish out of the water. They are confined to a very limited area,\r\ncomprising the Moluccas, New Guinea and Northern Australia. About ten\r\nspecies of these birds are now known, all much resembling each other,\r\nbut yet sufficiently distinguishable in every locality. The Amboynese\r\nspecies, of which a very accurate representation is here given, is one\r\nof the largest and handsomest. It is full seventeen inches long to the\r\ntips of the tail-feathers; the bill is coral red, the under-surface pure\r\nwhite, the back and wings deep purple, while the shoulders, head and\r\nnape, and some spots on the upper part of the back and wings, are pure\r\nazure blue; the tail is white, with the feathers narrowly blue-edged,\r\nbut the narrow part of the long feathers is rich blue. This was an\r\nentirely new species, and has been well named after an ocean goddess, by\r\nMr. R. G. Gray.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas eve I returned to Amboyna, where I stayed about ten days\r\nwith my kind friend Dr. Mohnike. Considering that I had been away only\r\ntwenty days, and that on five or six of those I was prevented doing\r\nanything by wet weather and slight attacks of fever, I had made a very\r\nnice collection of insects, comprising a much larger proportion of large\r\nand brilliant species than I had ever before obtained in so short a\r\ntime. Of the beautiful metallic Buprestidae I had about a dozen handsome\r\nspecies, yet in the doctor's collection I observed four or five more\r\nvery fine ones, so that Amboyna is unusually rich in this elegant group.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay here I had a good opportunity of seeing how Europeans\r\nlive in the Dutch colonies, and where they have adopted customs far\r\nmore in accordance with the climate than we have done in our tropical\r\npossessions. Almost all business is transacted in the morning between\r\nthe hours of seven and twelve, the afternoon being given up to repose,\r\nand the evening to visiting. When in the house during the heat of the\r\nday, and even at dinner, they use a loose cotton dress, only putting on\r\na suit of thin European-made clothes for out of doors and evening wear.\r\nThey often walk about after sunset bareheaded, reserving the black hat\r\nfor visits of ceremony. Life is thus made far more agreeable, and the\r\nfatigue and discomfort incident to the climate greatly diminished.\r\nChristmas day is not made much of, but on New Year's day official\r\nand complimentary visits are paid, and about sunset we went to the\r\nGovernor's, where a large party of ladies and gentlemen were assembled.\r\nTea and coffee were handed around, as is almost universal during a\r\nvisit, as well as cigars, for on no occasion is smoking prohibited\r\nin Dutch colonies, cigars being generally lighted before the cloth is\r\nwithdrawn at dinner, even though half the company are ladies. I here\r\nsaw for the first time the rare black lory from New Guinea, Chalcopsitta\r\natra. The plumage is rather glossy, and slightly tinged with yellowish\r\nand purple, the bill and feet being entirely black.\r\n\r\nThe native Amboynese who reside in the city are a strange\r\nhalf-civilized, half-savage lazy people, who seem to be a mixture of at\r\nleast three races--Portuguese, Malay, and Papuan or Ceramese, with an\r\noccasional cross of Chinese or Dutch. The Portuguese element decidedly\r\npredominates in the old Christian population, as indicated by features,\r\nhabits, and the retention of many Portuguese words in the Malay, which\r\nis now their language. They have a peculiar style of dress which they\r\nwear among themselves, a close-fitting white shirt with black trousers,\r\nand a black frock or upper shirt. The women seem to prefer a dress\r\nentirely black. On festivals and state occasions they adopt the\r\nswallow-tail coat, chimneypot hat, and their accompaniments, displaying\r\nall the absurdity of our European fashionable dress. Though now\r\nProtestants, they preserve at feasts and weddings the processions and\r\nmusic of the Catholic Church, curiously mixed up with the gongs and\r\ndances of the aborigines of the country. Their language has still much\r\nmore Portuguese than Dutch in it, although they have been in close\r\ncommunication with the latter nation for more than two hundred and fifty\r\nyears; even many names of birds, trees and other natural objects, as\r\nwell as many domestic terms, being plainly Portuguese. [The following\r\nare a few of the Portuguese words in common use by the Malay-speaking\r\nnatives of Amboyna and the other Molucca islands: Pombo (pigeon);\r\nmilo (maize); testa (forehead); horas (hours); alfinete (pin); cadeira\r\n(chair); lenco (handkerchief); fresco (cool); trigo (flour); sono\r\n(sloop); familia (family); histori (talk); vosse (you); mesmo (even);\r\ncunhado (brother-in-law); senhor (sir); nyora for signora (madam). None\r\nof them, however, have the least notion that these words belong to a\r\nEuropean language.] This people seems to have had a marvellous power\r\nof colonization, and a capacity for impressing their national\r\ncharacteristics on every country they conquered, or in which they\r\neffected a merely temporary settlement. In a suburb of Amboyna there\r\nis a village of aboriginal Malays who are Mahometans, and who speak a\r\npeculiar language allied to those of Ceram, as well as Malay. They are\r\nchiefly fishermen, and are said to be both more industrious and more\r\nhonest than the native Christians.\r\n\r\nI went on Sunday, by invitation, to see a collection of shells and fish\r\nmade by a gentleman of Amboyna. The fishes are perhaps unrivalled for\r\nvariety and beauty by those of any one spot on the earth. The celebrated\r\nDutch ichthyologist, Dr. Blecker, has given a catalogue of seven hundred\r\nand eighty species found at Amboyna, a number almost equal to those of\r\nall the seas and rivers of Europe. A large proportion of them are of the\r\nmost brilliant colours, being marked with bands and spots of the purest\r\nyellows, reds, and blues; while their forms present all that strange and\r\nendless variety so characteristic of the inhabitants of the ocean.\r\nThe shells are also very numerous, and comprise a number of the finest\r\nspecies in the world. The Mactras and Ostreas in particular struck me by\r\nthe variety and beauty of their colours. Shells have long been an\r\nobject of traffic in Amboyna; many of the natives get their living by\r\ncollecting and cleaning them, and almost every visitor takes away a\r\nsmall collection. The result is that many of the commoner-sorts have\r\nlost all value in the eyes of the amateur, numbers of the handsome but\r\nvery common cones, cowries, and olives sold in the streets of London for\r\na penny each, being natives of the distant isle of Amboyna, where they\r\ncannot be bought so cheaply. The fishes in the collection were all well\r\npreserved in clear spirit in hundreds of glass jars, and the shells were\r\narranged in large shallow pith boxes lined with paper, every specimen\r\nbeing fastened down with thread. I roughly estimated that there were\r\nnearly a thousand different kinds of shells, and perhaps ten thousand\r\nspecimens, while the collection of Amboyna fishes was nearly perfect.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January I left Amboyna for Ternate; but two years later,\r\nin October 1859, I again visited it after my residence in Menado, and\r\nstayed a month in the town in a small house which I hired for the sake\r\nof assorting and packing up a large and varied collection which I had\r\nbrought with me from North Celebes, Ternate, and Gilolo. I was obliged\r\nto do this because the mail steamer would have come the following month\r\nby way of Amboyna to Ternate, and I should have been delayed two months\r\nbefore I could have reached the former place. I then paid my first\r\nvisit to Ceram, and on returning to prepare for my second more complete\r\nexploration of that island, I stayed (much against my will) two months\r\nat Paso, on the isthmus which connects the two portions of the island of\r\nAmboyna. This village is situated on the eastern side of the isthmus,\r\non sandy ground, with a very pleasant view over the sea to the island of\r\nHarúka. On the Amboyna side of the isthmus there is a small river\r\nwhich has been continued by a shallow canal to within thirty yards of\r\nhigh-water mark on the other side. Across this small space, which is\r\nsandy and but slightly elevated, all small boats and praus can be easily\r\ndragged, and all the smaller traffic from Ceram and the islands of\r\nSaparúa and Harúka, passes through Paso. The canal is not continued\r\nquite through, merely because every spring-tide would throw up just such\r\na sand-bank as now exists.\r\n\r\nI had been informed that the fine butterfly Ornithoptera priamus\r\nwas plentiful here, as well as the racquet-tailed kingfisher and the\r\nring-necked lory. I found, however, that I had missed the time for the\r\nformer, and birds of all kinds were very scarce, although I obtained a\r\nfew good ones, including one or two of the above-mentioned rarities.\r\nI was much pleased to get here the fine long-armed chafer, Euchirus\r\nlongimanus. This extraordinary insect is rarely or never captured except\r\nwhen it comes to drink the sap of the sugar palms, where it is found by\r\nthe natives when they go early in the morning to take away the bamboos\r\nwhich have been filled during the night. For some time one or two were\r\nbrought me every day, generally alive. They are sluggish insects, and\r\npull themselves lazily along by means of their immense forelegs. A\r\nfigure of this and other Moluccan beetles is given in the 27th CHAPTER\r\nof this work.\r\n\r\nI was kept at Paso by an inflammatory eruption, brought on by the\r\nconstant attacks of small acari-like harvest-bugs, for which the forests\r\nof Ceram are famous, and also by the want of nourishing food while in\r\nthat island. At one time I was covered with severe boils. I had them on\r\nmy eye, cheek, armpits, elbows, back, thighs, knees, and ankles, so that\r\nI was unable to sit or walk, and had great difficulty in finding a side\r\nto lie upon without pain. These continued for some weeks, fresh ones\r\ncoming out as fast as others got well; but good living and sea baths\r\nultimately cured them.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of January Charles Allen, who had been my assistant in\r\nMalacca and Borneo, again joined me on agreement for three years; and as\r\nsoon as I got tolerably well, we had plenty to do laying in stores and\r\nmaking arrangements for our ensuing campaign. Our greatest difficulty\r\nwas in obtaining men, but at last we succeeded in getting two each. An\r\nAmboyna Christian named Theodorus Matakena, who had been some time with\r\nme and had learned to skin birds very well, agreed to go with Allen,\r\nas well as a very quiet and industrious lad named Cornelius, whom I\r\nhad brought from Menado. I had two Amboynese, named Petrus Rehatta, and\r\nMesach Matakena; the latter of whom had two brothers, named respectively\r\nShadrach and Abednego, in accordance with the usual custom among these\r\npeople of giving only Scripture names to their children.\r\n\r\nDuring the time I resided in this place, I enjoyed a luxury I have never\r\nmet with either before or since--the true bread-fruit. A good deal of it\r\nhas been planted about here and in the surrounding villages, and almost\r\nevery day we had opportunities of purchasing some, as all the boats\r\ngoing to Amboyna were unloaded just opposite my door to be dragged\r\nacross the isthmus. Though it grows in several other parts of the\r\nArchipelago, it is nowhere abundant, and the season for it only lasts a\r\nshort time. It is baked entire in the hot embers, and the inside scooped\r\nout with a spoon. I compared it to Yorkshire pudding; Charles Allen said\r\nit was like mashed potatoes and milk. It is generally about the size of\r\na melon, a little fibrous towards the centre, but everywhere else quite\r\nsmooth and puddingy, something in consistence between yeast-dumplings\r\nand batter-pudding. We sometimes made curry or stew of it, or fried it\r\nin slices; but it is no way so good as simply baked. It may be eaten\r\nsweet or savory. With meat and gravy it is a vegetable superior to any\r\nI know, either in temperate or tropical countries. With sugar, milk,\r\nbutter, or treacle, it is a delicious pudding, having a very slight and\r\ndelicate but characteristic flavour, which, like that of good bread and\r\npotatoes, one never gets tired of. The reason why it is comparatively\r\nscarce is that it is a fruit of which the seeds are entirely aborted by\r\ncultivation, and the tree can therefore only be propagated by cuttings.\r\nThe seed-bearing variety is common all over the tropics, and though the\r\nseeds are very good eating, resembling chestnuts, the fruit is quite\r\nworthless as a vegetable. Now that steam and Ward's cases render the\r\ntransport of young plants so easy, it is much to be wished that the best\r\nvarieties of this unequalled vegetable should be introduced into our\r\nWest India islands, and largely propagated there. As the fruit will keep\r\nsome time after being gathered, we might then be able to obtain this\r\ntropical luxury in Covent Garden Market.\r\n\r\nAlthough the few months I at various times spent in Amboyna were not\r\naltogether very profitable to me in the way of collections, it will\r\nalways remain as a bright spot in the review of my Eastern travels,\r\nsince it was there that I first made the acquaintance of those glorious\r\nbirds and insects which render the Moluccas classic ground in the\r\neyes of the naturalist, and characterise its fauna as one of the most\r\nremarkable and beautiful upon the globe. On the 20th of February I\r\nfinally quitted Amboyna for Ceram and Waigiou, leaving Charles Allen to\r\ngo by a Government boat to Wahai on the north coast of Ceram, and thence\r\nto the unexplored island of Mysol.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Next Volume",
