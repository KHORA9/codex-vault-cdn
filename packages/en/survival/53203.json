Geological researches, however, have discovered\r\nfossil remains of the horse in almost ever part of the world--from\r\nthe tropical plains of India, to the frozen regions of Siberia--from\r\nthe northern extremities of the new world, to the southern point of\r\nAmerica. But among the Hebrews, horses were rare previous to the\r\ndays of Solomon, who had horses brought out of Egypt, after his\r\nmarriage with the daughter of Pharaoh, and so rapidly did he multiply\r\nthem by purchase and by breeding, that those kept for his own use\r\nrequired, as it is written, “four thousand stables, and forty thousand\r\nstalls.” Hence, when honored by a visit from the beautiful queen of\r\nSheba, bringing with her, camels bearing spices, and very much gold\r\nand precious stones, it was doubtless in the contemplation of his\r\nmagnificent stud of horses and chariots, kept for the amusement of his\r\nwives and concubines, as well as for his other vast displays of power\r\nand magnificence, that her majesty exclaimed, in the fulness of her\r\nadmiration: “Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came and mine\r\neyes had seen it, and behold the half was not told unto me.”\r\n\r\nVeterinary science has also made great progress from that time down\r\nto the present, and in particular, in the last half century, the\r\nstructure of the horse--injuries and diseases to which he is subject,\r\nand the treatment of these, have been investigated, in this country\r\nand abroad, with much diligence and success, both in colleges and in\r\nsocieties devoted to the cultivation of veterinary knowledge, and by\r\npractitioners, whose education and experience render their observations\r\nworthy of great respect; but notwithstanding all this, there has always\r\nbeen, to the present time, one point overlooked, which is of greater\r\nimportance, than any one that has ever been investigated. I refer here\r\nto a complete treatise on the Mare and Foal at the time of delivery.\r\nThis has long been felt as a real want. Not a single engraving,\r\nillustrating this subject has ever been handed to the public, and very\r\nlittle has been written on the treatment of the mare and the foal at\r\nthe time of delivery. When the best authors come to this point, they\r\nsay, “call in a veterinary Surgeon.” But, I would ask, where is the\r\nveterinary Surgeon to obtain his information? And yet, not only the\r\nsurgeon, but every farmer and breeder should possess a full knowledge\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe man that first enters the stable should be able to administer to\r\nthe wants of the mare and the foal. There is no time to be lost--no\r\ntime now to obtain information, or to proceed four or five miles for\r\na surgeon. If all is right, in five minutes all will be well, but if\r\na false position is presented, the first person that approaches the\r\nanimal should be able to administer to the wants of the mare and foal.\r\nIf not, there is much danger for the life of the foal, and in a few\r\nhours much danger is to be feared for the safety of the mare.\r\n\r\nI have had a very extensive practice in the veterinary business for\r\nmore than nineteen years, and found it almost universally to be the\r\ncase, that in the event of mal-presentation, the foal had suffocated\r\nbefore I could reach the spot, although I was but a very few miles\r\ndistant. If the foal is raised from its locality, it must be exposed\r\nto the free atmosphere in twenty minutes or it will suffocate, and the\r\nlife of the mare will be much in danger. Often, after I had extracted\r\nthe foal, I could have obtained twenty dollars for restoring its life.\r\n\r\nI have frequently been urged by farmers and breeders, to give them full\r\ninstructions on this subject, and especially, at such times, when a\r\ndifficult case presented itself, but I always found it impracticable,\r\nas verbal instruction would soon be forgotten, and as no work,\r\nillustrating this subject was in existence. I was induced, therefore,\r\nin order to benefit the farmer and breeder, to publish a complete\r\ntreatise on the mare and foal, at the time of delivery, illustrated\r\nby engravings. I had made an effort about seven years ago, but that\r\nlittle instrument, the “pen,” in my hand, is what the yoke is to the\r\nox, and so I abandoned it for that time. The cart-whip in my hand is\r\na fine instrument, but the pen is my abhorrence. Notwithstanding, at\r\nthe earnest request of numerous dealers in horses, I was induced in the\r\nSpring of 1869, to offer this work to the public, for the benefit of\r\nthe farmer and breeder, and in mercy to the mare and foal.\r\n\r\nThis work, as the reader will discover, embraces every particular\r\nconnected with the subject upon which it treats, with ample engravings,\r\nillustrating the different positions in which a foal is presented--its\r\nnatural delivery--false presentations, etc., with lucid explanations\r\nand instructions.\r\n\r\nCONRAD MITCHELL.\r\n\r\nNew Berlin, Pa., July, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.]\r\n\r\nThe above Engraving represents the Foal, as it is folded up in the womb\r\nof the Mare when fully developed, in the right flank of the animal, the\r\nchest of the Foal toward the tail of the Mare, the front legs turned\r\nbackwards, and the hind legs turned forward under the body of the\r\nFoal, the head and neck turned back in its left side, so that the head\r\nwill rest on the first false ribs. From the time of covering the Mare,\r\nto the time of foaling, generally requires a period of three hundred\r\nand thirty days. A few instances, however, came under my observation,\r\nin which fine, full-grown, and healthy colts were delivered in three\r\nhundred and twelve days, while others delayed their appearance for a\r\nperiod of three hundred and ninety days, before the owner could rejoice\r\nin the valuable prize brought to his stable. The full chested, round\r\ntrunked mare will develope a foal much sooner than the flat-sided, lean\r\nand camel-backed one.\r\n\r\nIn nine days after the covering of the mare, the womb will begin to\r\nclose about fifteen inches from the entrance; at the same time, the\r\nfecund seed of the horse will change into bloody streaks, and the\r\nbalance becomes like cream on curdled milk about six hours after it is\r\nstrained, and in from forty to fifty days, the foal will be regularly\r\nshaped, and about the size of a small rat. At the same time a membrane\r\nor skin will spread around the entrance inside of the womb, from which\r\na number of small cords branch out, uniting together as they run along,\r\nuntil they form one cord, extending to the navel of the foal, through\r\nwhich the blood of the mare circulates in the foal, in order to give it\r\nnourishment. At the same time another membrane or skin is formed around\r\nthe foal, in which are contained from four to six, and even eight\r\nquarts of yellowish fluid, which answers a twofold purpose: first, it\r\nprevents all friction between the foal and membrane, and secondly, it\r\nassists in raising the foal from its locality. At the first throes of\r\nthe mare, the action of the womb will cause the membrane or skin to\r\nprotrude through the entrance of the womb, and the fluid will be forced\r\ninto it, and the weight will assist in raising the foal, until it will\r\nbe presented when the skin will break and the channel will be opened\r\nfor the foal to breath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.]\r\n\r\nThe above Engraving presents the natural position of the foal in\r\ndelivery. The two front feet will be presented first, and the muzzle\r\nor the nostrils will rest on the top of the legs, and the membrane\r\nor skin around the foal, spoken of in Plate I, will already protrude\r\nabout two feet. The hind legs will sink down more and more, until they\r\nwill be stretched out behind horizontally. Sometimes one foot will\r\nraise up too high and be forced against the inside of the entrance.\r\nThe hand should be introduced and the foot pushed back a few inches\r\nand then brought back into the channel. Sometimes the forehead will\r\nproject against the upper part of the entrance, when the hand should be\r\nintroduced, and hold should be taken back of the poll, with a downward\r\npressure, the other hand to the muzzle to raise it up, and a gentle\r\npull should be made, when all will be right in a few minutes. The cord\r\nrunning to the navel of the colt should be tied about one inch from the\r\nsurface of the skin, then cut off about one inch from the string, or if\r\nno string is at hand, the cord should be pressed very tightly between\r\nthe thumb and the two first fingers of the hand for a few minutes, then\r\ncut off, and it will bleed no more. The colt should be drawn away a\r\nfew feet, but not toward the mare, as she should not be disturbed.\r\nThe mare will lie down flat, apparently dead, and will remain in this\r\nsituation, five, ten, and even sometimes thirty minutes, according to\r\nthe severity of the operation she has undergone. Suddenly she will\r\nraise her head, look about the stable, lie down again, and roll three\r\nor four times on her back, but never over her back, which is done for\r\nthe purpose of loosening the membrane or lining of the womb spoken of\r\nin Plate I, when she will rise up, go after her offspring, lick and dry\r\nit, after which the membrane and the afterbirth will be discharged.\r\nWhen the colt is dry, it should be assisted to its mother to obtain\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nSometimes the membrane attached to the womb will remain fast, and in\r\nthis manner retain the afterbirth. In this case, bleeding from three\r\nto four quarts, and giving following dose of medicine in one pint of\r\nflaxseed tea is recommended, viz:\r\n\r\n    1 oz. Laudanum,\r\n    1 oz. sweet Spirits of Niter.\r\n\r\nThis will correct everything in a few hours. In some extreme cases,\r\nthe membrane, the afterbirth and the fluid contained with the foal\r\nremained in the womb after a complete separation from the womb, causing\r\nsuch a strong inflammation, that some parts had began to mortify.\r\nI have bled copiously, and given one large tablespoonful of fever\r\nmedicine, composed of\r\n\r\n    4 oz. of Nitre,\r\n    ½  ”  ”  Digitalis,\r\n    ½  ”  ”  Tartar Emetic,\r\n\r\nin one pint of Linseed tea, every three hours, and by means of a\r\nsyringe, or bladder, with a clean piece of elder tied in the neck, I\r\nhave injected into the womb from four to six quarts of Linseed tea,\r\nwhich caused a copious discharge of bloody matter from the womb,\r\namounting sometimes to a bucket full. In extraordinary cases, the\r\npurifying organs were overpowered and the mortified blood was carried\r\nthrough the whole system, and even then the mare recovered to a certain\r\ndegree, until in about a week afterwards her hoofs came off, caused by\r\nthe mortified blood, and she was accordingly destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.]\r\n\r\nThe above Engraving represents a false presentation. The two fore feet\r\nare presented, and the head remains behind in the right flank of the\r\nmare. The operator will be able to tell whether they are the front\r\nor hind feet, by examining the knee joints. Now, a bowl containing\r\ntwo or three quarts of very warm water, with a large tablespoonful of\r\nvery fine lard or linseed oil on the surface of the water, should be\r\nat hand. Under no circumstances should a hand or arm be introduced to\r\nthe mare, unless first thoroughly warmed and greased, otherwise they\r\nare rank poison to the mare. After the arm is prepared, the fingers\r\nand thumb should be brought to a point, and should be introduced,\r\nfollowing the channel, until the neck of the foal is reached at Fig.\r\n1, when the full right hand should grasp the neck, the left hand being\r\nsupported against the mare, when the operator should pull with all his\r\nstrength, in order to draw the neck further up, when the hand should\r\npass down along the neck, still drawing as it passes along, until\r\nreaching Fig. 2, the ear, when he can make good progress, until he\r\ncan insert the middle finger in the eye, at which point he is able to\r\nraise the muzzle, Fig. 3, so far, that he may close his hand over it,\r\nand in a minute, all will be right in the operation. But let no one\r\nsuppose, that this is accomplished in ten or fifteen minutes. Sometimes\r\nit may, but in many instances, I have labored for an hour, and even\r\ntwo and a half hours. In some cases, the severe exertion, and the heat\r\nof the mare, caused my arterial circulation to force so powerfully in\r\nmy arm, that I was often afraid my veins would burst; in this case I\r\nwould withdraw my arm for a minute or two, and then go to work again.\r\nIn my entire practice, I have failed but in three cases, that of two\r\nmares and one cow, to accomplish my object. I was often called, where\r\ntwo, three, and even four men had been summoned before me, owing to the\r\ndistance I lived away, and succeeded in every instance where others\r\nfailed. I resolved not to fail in any case, but this determination\r\nproved disastrous to myself, inasmuch, as I became subject to\r\npalpitation of the heart, so that I could not follow my business for\r\nmore than twelve years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\nOf the cases represented in Plate III, I had a large number; of such as\r\nare presented in Plate IV, only a few, of which I will describe only\r\none. On the 13th of June, 1854, I was called to the premises of Mr.\r\nGeorge Braucher, in Hartley township, Union county.\r\n\r\nIn this case the hand and arm must be prepared, as already described,\r\nand inserted to the elbow, Fig. 1. A great amount of force is required\r\nto raise the leg, until the knee joint is brought up. The left hand\r\nshould then be warmed and greased by an assistant, and introduced,\r\nplacing it on the knee-joint; the right hand should then be passed\r\ndown, grasp the foot, and turn it backwards, when the left hand\r\nshould press inward with great force, and with the right hand bring\r\nup the foot, keeping it turned backwards. When the foot is brought\r\nup, a rope should be attached to the lower jaw of the foal, when an\r\nassistant should take hold of the rope and pull in a slightly downward\r\ndirection; in this way the foal will be delivered with the greatest\r\nease. Sometimes one shoulder will present itself, and the other will\r\nincline a little to the rear. Under such circumstances, too much force\r\nshould not be employed; the foal should be turned sometimes from right\r\nto left, and then again from left to right, frequently introducing the\r\nhand, and moving it around the foal. In all cases the membrane or skin\r\nshould be kept in its proper position around the foal, as this will\r\ngreatly assist the work, and make it one of comparative ease.\r\n\r\nIn the above case, the foal presented itself in the afternoon of the\r\n12th, and all the knowing men of the neighborhood were summoned, and\r\nall of them labored until night, when they were obliged to give it up\r\nand pronounce it a failure.--The next morning a messenger was sent for\r\nme. I arrived at the spot at half past ten o’clock, in the morning, and\r\nat twelve o’clock noon, I had the object accomplished, and we sat down\r\nto a hearty dinner. In December 1868, the mare was still alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of April, 1855, when about ready to retire to bed after\r\na hard day’s drive, two messengers, Mr. B. Cramer, from Middlecreek,\r\nand Mr. Uriah Berger, from Centre township, arrived at my house\r\ntogether. After some consideration, I concluded to accompany Mr.\r\nBerger, and on arriving, I found a foal, having presented itself as\r\nrepresented in the preceding Engraving. Before my arrival, three men\r\nhad exerted all their strength for an hour or more, to extract it, but\r\nhaving failed, they left before my arrival.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the mare is very restless, repeatedly rising up and lying\r\ndown again. It will require one man to attend to the head of the mare,\r\nand two men must take hold of the foal, raise it up toward the tail of\r\nthe mare, and bear inwards with all their strength, when the operator\r\nmust put all his force to one of the hind feet, and push that in at\r\nfull arm’s length; the other side must be treated in the same manner.\r\nBut let each one bear in mind, when the foal is moved inward, the mare\r\nwill have pain and that she will bear towards you, so that sometimes\r\nbut little is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWe labored faithfully from eleven o’clock until one, when I took a\r\nmidnight meal and departed for Middlecreek township.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of the above kind, however, I had accomplished my object\r\nin much less time, than in this one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, 1855, I was called to the premises of John Deabler,\r\nin Beaver township, Snyder county, where I found a foal presenting the\r\ntail, as represented in Plate VI. Presentations of this kind occur\r\nbut rarely. In this case the operator must prepare his hand and arm as\r\nbefore stated, and introduce it, taking hold over the stifle-joint at\r\nFig. 1, then, by a strong effort, pull upward slipping his hand down to\r\nFig. 2, when he must draw up the knee-joint as far as possible; then\r\nplace the left hand on the knee joint, and pass the right hand down to\r\nFig. 3, the foot, grasp it firmly, and bend it backward, at the same\r\ntime pulling upward, and with left the hand bearing inward, when the\r\nfoot will yield in a moment. The other side must be dealt with in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.]\r\n\r\nThe above Engraving represents the foal with the hind feet foremost.\r\nThey will generally be projected against the upper part of the\r\nentrance. It is best to extract them in this position, as turning\r\nthem is almost impossible. The head will remain so far behind, that it\r\ncannot be reached. By keeping the membrane or skin properly over the\r\nfoal, there will be but little difficulty experienced in extracting\r\nit. The foal should sometimes be drawn downward toward the feet of the\r\nmare, and then upwards towards the tail, frequently turning it half way\r\nround, and then back again. The foal will necessarily be dead.\r\n\r\nMany cases of this kind will occur in a neighborhood in the course of\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.]\r\n\r\nThe above Engraving represents a foal which has died from some cause\r\nor other about nine days ago, the mare wanting the proper pains to\r\ndeliver it. The foal is now bloated to such an extent, that it is in\r\na condition to rupture the womb, and the hand can not be passed around\r\nthe foal. It is an utter impossibility to extract it in the usual way.\r\nThe operator must procure a knife, very straight in the blade, from\r\ntwelve to fifteen inches in length, wrap the whole blade in a piece\r\nof muslin, take the point of the knife in his left hand, turning the\r\nedge downward, put his hand in the entrance of the womb and run it\r\ndown until he reaches the chest of the foal. He must then introduce\r\nthe right hand, grasp the handle, and hold it firm; then with the left\r\nhand he will slip the muslin from the blade, and with the first finger\r\nof the left hand find the spot where the windpipe comes out of the\r\nchest. After the point of the knife is set, the right hand must force\r\nthe blade, to its full length if possible, through the Diaphragm, and\r\nthen withdraw it. The left hand must retain its hold upon the muslin\r\nduring the entire operation, and as the blade is withdrawn from the\r\nfoal, it must again be carefully wrapped around the knife, the left\r\nhand seizing the point in the same manner as when it was introduced.\r\nAfter the arm holding the knife is withdrawn, a very nauseous gas\r\nwill escape, and in a short time the front feet may be reached, then\r\nthe head, after which the operation will proceed as described in the\r\nforegoing pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th day of May, 1854, I was called to the field of Mr. Sem\r\nSchoch, of New Berlin, Union county, Pa., where I found a mare in the\r\nact of foaling, in which the foal presented the four feet at once.\r\nThese cases are of rare occurrence, and it is well for the veterinary\r\nSurgeon, or his life would be a brief one. I never injured myself at\r\nany work to a greater extent, than I did in treating these cases.\r\n\r\nSometimes the hoofs will only protrude from the entrance, leaving the\r\nwhole body of the foal in a curved position the head being turned\r\nbackward, as described in the foregoing Engraving. The head should be\r\nbrought forward, but I always found it impossible in every case of this\r\ndescription, to accomplish this. A cord must be looped around the hind\r\nlegs, to avoid losing them; then the four legs must be put back again\r\nas far as possible, and the foal must be turned, in order to get the\r\nhead down and the back up.\r\n\r\nIf an effort was made to extract the foal as it is presented, the back\r\nwould come in below, and the operation would be impossible; but if it\r\nis properly turned, it may be extracted in the same manner, as those\r\nwhich present only the hind feet, as already described. These cases\r\nrequire more aid than any others that I have ever treated. Two or three\r\nmen should take hold of the mare’s head and neck, to keep her down,\r\notherwise she will plunge about fearfully. One or two men should assist\r\nthe Surgeon, as the effort required for this operation is so great that\r\none man is soon exhausted.\r\n\r\nTwo and three hours are often required to accomplish the object in\r\nthese cases, but I have succeeded in every one of them in preserving\r\nthe mare alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COW AND CALF.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe average period of gestation in the cow is 270 days; the shortest\r\n120 days, and the longest 313 days. The calf is placed in the same\r\nposition, and in the same side of the cow, as is the foal in the mare.\r\nMal-presentations of calves are treated in the same manner as those of\r\nthe foal, with this advantage, that calves will live much longer than\r\nthe foal. I have had cases, where I extracted the calf twenty-four\r\nhours after they were raised, and delivered them alive and sound.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks before calving, the cow should have, in addition to\r\nher ordinary food, a half pint of rye, evening and morning, as that is\r\na sure means of taking the cleaning right after the delivery of the\r\ncalf. Should this be neglected, she should be slopped with two quarts\r\nof wheat bran and half a teacupful of flaxseed, twice a day. If the\r\ncleaning does not come off on the third day, it should be twisted back\r\nof the cow’s shape, until it becomes a solid cord, when a small knife\r\nenclosed in the hand should be introduced into the womb, and the cord\r\ncut off about fifteen inches from the entrance. This is about all that\r\nwill incommode the cow; the other will pass off about the ninth day,\r\nand the cow will be all right. Should the cow have inflammation in the\r\nudder, or any other place, she should be drenched with one lb. of Epsom\r\nSalts. The horns should be examined, and if they are sometimes warm and\r\nthen cold again, a hole should be bored through them, about two inches\r\nfrom the head, and the back of the cow should be fomented with very\r\nstrong salt-water; the tail should be slit on both sides about an inch\r\nand a half. In extreme cases a charge should be boiled, and spread on\r\nthe loins, consisting of\r\n\r\n    1 pint of tar,\r\n    2 oz. Rosin,\r\n    2 oz. Beeswax.\r\n\r\nAfter the charge is spread on, it should be covered with tow or wool.\r\n\r\nCalves will sometimes, on account of the cow’s milk being burned, have\r\na severe Diarrhea. When this is the case they should be drenched with\r\nmilk from the cow, containing one large tablespoonful of wheat flour,\r\nand half a teaspoonful of ginger. Should this not be sufficient, opium\r\nmay be added to it the size of two grains of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAP OR POX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of June, 1853, a Stallion was brought under my\r\nobservation, owned by Christian Kerr, of Centre township, then\r\nUnion county, which had ten distinct ulcers on his penis, varying\r\nin size from a pea to a dime. These ulcers were accompanied with a\r\ndischarge, sometimes bloody, emitting a very disagreeable odor, that\r\nwas perceptible at a distance of three or four rods. The attendant of\r\nthis horse, noticed these ulcers about five days previous to the time\r\nI was consulted, when the marks were very small. He remarked to me,\r\nthat “people declined to allow his horse to cover their mares, stating,\r\nthat he was diseased with the pox.” And I actually found this to be the\r\ncase. I dressed the horse, and sent him away.\r\n\r\nThat night I examined all the works veterinary Science that I could\r\ncommand, and found but a single one that made the least mention of the\r\ndisease, but giving neither the cause or treatment of it.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week, I had over twenty mares to attend, that were\r\naffected by the horse.\r\n\r\nI treated the horse and mares according to the best of my judgment,\r\nhaving first obtained the advice of an eminent human Physician, and I\r\nsoon became perfect master of the disease, and saved all but two mares\r\nthat were placed under my care. I found, that where the disease had\r\ntaken deep root and entered the system, every effort to save the animal\r\nwas in vain, and hence, I am satisfied, that where the disease has\r\nbeen suffered to go unchecked, until it became so deeply rooted as to\r\nvitiate the whole system, it is incurable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE.\r\n\r\nMares will sometime get in season early in the spring, when they will\r\ndischarge a thin, whitish fluid, resembling bluish milk, of a glutinous\r\nnature, but very clean. If the mare does not become pregnant until the\r\nlatter part of May or the beginning of June, this fluid will change\r\ninto a mattery state, and will affect the parts in the region of the\r\nwomb to such an extent as to cause rawness and inflammation.\r\n\r\nA mare, that is in a condition as described above, is very apt to\r\ncommunicate to the horse covering her, the disease of Gonorrhœa, or\r\nClap, especially if such horse be permitted to cover from five, twelve\r\nand fifteen mares a day, where another horse, covering only once every\r\nfew days will escape unharmed. The reason of this is evident; the penis\r\nof the one covering so many mares, becomes very tender and almost\r\ntransparent, so as almost to cause the blood to shine through it.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which a horse is apt to become diseased, is, when\r\nhe is suffered to cover a mare on the ninth day after she has undergone\r\nthe process of foaling. At this period there is still a discharge of\r\nbloody matter, which is very apt to generate clap in an animal of the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nSometimes there will appear on the penis of the Stallion, small white\r\nblotches, on the surface of the skin, from the size of a pin’s head to\r\nthat of a grain of wheat, which, on the following day will be double\r\nin size. On the third or fourth day, a pea might be set in the ulcers,\r\nwhich will emit an offensive odor, and which will spread with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nIn the mare blotches will appear on the shape, of a deep red color,\r\napparently eaten through the surface of the skin, which will enlarge\r\nvery rapidly. In a day or two, small tumors will appear, extending from\r\nthe shape in a downward direction to the hams. These tumors are of\r\ndifferent sizes, varying from that of a pea to that of a half gallon\r\ncrock. They are of a very virulent nature, very often causing a painful\r\nrawness in the entrance to the womb, and extending from one to one and\r\na half inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Stallion should be brought out to a fence, and a mare should be\r\nplaced on the other side of the fence, distant about one rod. This will\r\ncause the Stallion to present his penis. A clean crock should be in\r\nreadiness, containing two ounces of chloride of lime, and two quarts\r\nof lukewarm water. There should also be on hand a teacup, containing a\r\nstem of nitrate of silver one fourth of an inch in length, which should\r\nbe pulverized and dissolved in tablespoonful of water. Another teacup\r\nshould be at hand, containing one teaspoonful of tincture of myrrh.\r\n\r\nIn the crock there should be a sponge the size of an ordinary apple,\r\nwith a small stick tied to it. Each of the cups should be provided with\r\na small pencil, made of soft muslin, about the size of a quill.\r\n\r\nThe operator should now draw on a pair of leather gloves, and seize the\r\npenis at the point with the left hand, and with the right hand, take\r\nthe sponge and wash off the whole penis, from one end to the other.\r\nThen stir up the cup containing the nitrate of silver, take the pencil\r\nand anoint all the spots or marks on the penis; then follow with the\r\ntincture of myrrh.\r\n\r\nThis operation should be accomplished in less than fifteen minutes, and\r\nthe application should be made twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe mare should be brought out with a blind bridle and collar on, and\r\ntied with the head to a post. The tail should be doubled up and a rope\r\nlooped around it, and it should be drawn on the back and the rope tied\r\nto the collar. Then the whole shape should be washed off with the\r\nsolution of chloride of lime; then anoint the marks with the nitrate of\r\nsilver, and also with the tincture of myrrh. At each operation these\r\npreparations should be introduced about one and half inches within the\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nShould any tumors have made their appearance, they must be dressed in\r\nthe same manner. If they are large and soft, they should be cut open\r\nand then dressed in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing disease has sometimes reappeared in other animals for\r\nfour years following my treatment of the above cases but by always\r\nbringing them promptly to my notice, I succeeded invariably in checking\r\nit, so that it never came to the same state as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS IN COLTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes colts which are foaled early in the Spring, owing to the dry\r\nfood of the mare, will become so costive, that they will inevitably\r\ndie, if not relieved. As a general thing, this costiveness is confined\r\nto the rectum.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the colt, it should be drenched with half a teacupful of\r\nmilk from the mare, which should contain Barbadoes Aloes, the size\r\nof a grain of corn, pulverized, and about an equal amount of ginger,\r\nevery six hours; at the same time an injection should be prepared, as\r\nfollows: take one quart of wheat bran, and pour on it three quarts of\r\nboiling water. When cold draw off the liquid, add one teacupful of\r\nsweet milk, half a teacupful of molasses. Then by means of a syringe\r\ninject this composition into the rectum. Or, if a syringe cannot be\r\nprocured, a bladder with a clean piece of elder tied in the neck of\r\nit may be introduced into the rectum. In a few minutes after, a finger\r\nshould be inserted in the rectum, when a small ball of excrement may\r\nbe taken out, about the size of a hickory-nut. I have often taken out\r\ntwelve and fourteen such balls in the course of twenty minutes. After\r\nthis no more medicine is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHŒA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, the mare being fed too strong on rye chop feed, corn, or\r\nmow-burned oats, or being overworked, the milk gets too strong, causing\r\na very severe diarrhœa in the colt. This will so much exhaust the colt,\r\nthat it will die in a week or two.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--If occasioned by feeding rye chop, or any of the above\r\nnamed causes, discontinue the use of them, and substitute good oats and\r\nhay, and give the colt, in half a teacupful of milk from the mare:\r\n\r\n    One tablespoonful of wheat flour,\r\n    Opium, the size of two grains of wheat,\r\n    Ginger, half a teaspoonful,\r\n\r\nevery six hours, until it will sere. Should the colt have pain, which\r\nwill be exhibited by lying down and attempting to roll on its back, and\r\ngroaning incessantly, the treatment should be changed. Take half a\r\nteacupful of milk from the mare,\r\n\r\n    One large teaspoonful of laudanum,\r\n     ”    ”        ”      sweet spirits nitre,\r\n     ”    ”        ”      spirits turpentine,\r\n\r\nevery three hours, until relief is obtained.\r\n\r\nOr, boil very strong mint tea, and give two large tablespoonfuls every\r\nhour until relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEBLE COLTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes colts are very feeble when foaled. The cause may be\r\nattributed to the atmosphere, or rather to an epidemic peculiar to some\r\nlocalities. Many are brought forth so weak, that they are not able to\r\nrise without assistance. A constant dropping of water from the navel\r\nmay be perceivable, and the colt becomes so much enfeebled that death\r\nwill shortly ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE.\r\n\r\nSometimes after death, on examination, the liver was found to be\r\ndecayed; at other times the kidneys. Sometimes a blister will be found\r\non one side of the lungs, the size of a hen’s egg, and as clear as\r\ncrystal, and filled with a fluid. At other times it is nothing but a\r\ngeneral debility of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe colt should be drenched with half a teacupful of milk from the\r\nmare, which should contain,\r\n\r\n    ½ teaspoonful of Ginger,\r\n    1 tablespoonful of the best grape wine.\r\n\r\nA charge should be spread on the loins which should consist of\r\n\r\n    ½ lb. of Tar,\r\n    1 oz. of Rosin,\r\n    1 oz. of Beeswax,\r\n\r\nboiled into pitch, the whole covered with tow or wool, and the colt\r\nshould be well attended to. They will sometimes recover in a few days.\r\n\r\nOne came under my observation, that recovered after five weeks, and was\r\nsold for an extra price four years afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURE OF WOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorses are sometimes exposed to much danger, and will sometimes receive\r\nthe most extraordinary wounds. For the last ten years I have used very\r\nlittle else, than a solution of the chloride of Lime. It is a sure\r\nmeans of keeping out cold and inflammation.\r\n\r\nFirst clean the wound from all filthy matter, and bring it into a\r\nhealthy state, and in this manner nature will heal it as soon as the\r\nbest ointment in the world.\r\n\r\nTake chloride of Lime, 2 oz., dissolve it in 2 quarts of lukewarm\r\nwater. Then wash out the wound once a day. If it is deep and runs, a\r\nsyringe should be at hand in order to force the composition to every\r\npart of it in the inside. Should proud flesh spring up at the entrance\r\nof the wound, pulverized blue vitriol should be applied. In twenty-four\r\nhours after the application, you can rub off from one fourth to one\r\nhalf inch. Apply it again, until it gets below the surface of the\r\nskin, then apply a little tincture of myrrh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS ABOUT FATTENING HOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive your hogs an abundance of charcoal. If any should be foundered,\r\ntake 2 ounces of Nitre, (salt-peter,) 1 ounce of Barbadoes Aloes,\r\npulverize it very fine, and give the one fourth part of it every six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS ABOUT SHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your sheep out of clover pasture. Scant blue grass is the pasture\r\nfor sheep. Salt once a week. Raise the floor of your fold from four to\r\nsix feet above the ground, board it only on three sides, and simply\r\nlath it on the south side, and your sheep will be healthy and without\r\ndistemper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nERRATA.--On page eleven, in the fifth line, instead of “entrance,” read\r\n“whole.”\r\n\r\nFINIS.",
