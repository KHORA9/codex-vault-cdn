In the engines\r\nof the Spanish gunboats, of which we annex an illustration from\r\n_Engineering_, the designer, Captain Ericsson, has overcome these\r\nobjections by introducing a surface condenser, which, while it performs\r\nthe function of condensing the steam to be returned to the boiler in the\r\nform of fresh water, serves as the principal support of the engines,\r\ndispensing entirely with the usual framework. Besides this expedient,\r\neach pair of cylinders have their slide frames for guiding the movements\r\nof the piston rods cast in one piece. Altogether the combination, is\r\nsuch that the total weight and space occupied by these novel twin screw\r\nengines do not exceed the ordinary single screw engines of equal\r\npower. Several improvements connected with the working gear have been\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGINES OF THE TWIN SCREW SPANISH GUNBOATS]\r\n\r\nThe outer bearings of the propeller shafts, always difficult to regulate\r\nand keep in order on the twin screw system, are selfadjusting and\r\naccommodate themselves to every change of the direction of the shafts.\r\nThis is effected by their being spherical externally, and resting in\r\ncorresponding cavities in the stern braces or hangers. The spring\r\nbearings for supporting the middle of the shafts are also arranged on a\r\nsimilar self-adjusting principle.\r\n\r\nThe thrust bearing is of peculiar construction, the arrangement being\r\nsuch that the bearing surfaces remain in perfect contact however much\r\nthe shaft may be out of line. The reversing gear likewise is quite\r\npeculiar, insuring complete control over the movement of the two\r\npropellers under all circumstances. It is claimed that these engines are\r\nthe lightest and most compact yet constructed for twin screw vessels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Torpedo Boat Problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Army and Navy Journal_ thinks the problem of a torpedo boat\r\ncapable of firing rapidly and with certainty, has at length reached a\r\nsatisfactory solution. It says:\r\n\r\n\"A boat has been completed which is proved by experiment to be faultless\r\nin machinery and arrangement. On the 2d of December, Secretary Robeson,\r\nVice-Admiral Porter, and Commodore Case, Chief of the Bureau of\r\nOrdnance, went to the Navy Yard at Washington, to witness the experiment\r\nwith this new engine of destruction. After examining the workings of the\r\nmachinery, and the manner of firing, one of the destructives was put in\r\nthe frame and the party proceeded to the shore to witness the result. A\r\ntorpedo of only thirty-six pounds was first run out with rapidity and\r\nfired; but the result showed that this small amount of powder, even,\r\nwould have been sufficient to destroy any ship, by lifting her out of\r\nthe water and breaking her back, even if her bottom was not knocked out\r\naltogether. Mud and water were thrown up together, and the concussion\r\nwas felt far up in the Navy Yard, the ground being shaken by the shock\r\nof the powder against the bed of the river. The concussion felt on board\r\nthe torpedo-boat was not more than that caused by a wave striking a\r\nvessel at sea.\r\n\r\n\"Several torpedoes were fired from the vessel, the explosion of\r\nwhich the party witnessed on board, as they desired to ascertain for\r\nthemselves the effect of the shock. The result seemed satisfactory,\r\nas no change whatever is contemplated in the machinery, which is very\r\nsimple, and 'works to a charm.' The torpedo vessel is the _Nina_, a very\r\nstrong iron boat of three hundred and fifty tuns burden, capable of\r\ncrossing the ocean, and having a speed of seventeen knots an hour. She\r\nis not impervious to heavy shot, but can be made so, and is capable of\r\nresisting any ordinary projectile that could be brought to bear on her\r\nfrom the decks of a ship of war. Her decks will be made torpedo and\r\nshot-proof, and several arrangements will be applied, now that it is\r\nknown that the torpedo system is a success. Such a vessel as the _Nina_,\r\nattacking an enemy's squadron on our coast some dark night, or entering\r\nan enemy's port, could destroy half the vessels in the harbor, and\r\neasily escape as few vessels could overtake her. Such a vessel could,\r\nfor instance, enter the harbor of Havana, and destroy every vessel of\r\nwar in the port, under cover of darkness. A squadron supplied with such\r\nboats to be used to attack, after the fight began, and the ships were\r\nenveloped in smoke, would have a most decided advantage against an enemy\r\nnot thus armed for torpedo warfare. It is reported that our torpedo navy\r\nwill consist of twenty vessels, none of which will have a less speed\r\nthan twelve knots, and the fastest of them will go seventeen knots.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR MAKING IN LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans _Times_ contains, in a late number, an account of the\r\nmanufacture of sugar as conducted on the Poychas estate, from which we\r\nextract portions containing the essential particulars of cane sugar\r\nmaking as conducted in the southern portions of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Reaching the Cane shed, the crop, dumped into piles, is received by a\r\ncrowd of feeders, who place it (eight or ten stalks at a time) on the\r\ncane carrier. This is an elevator, on an endless band of wood and iron,\r\nwhich carries them to the second story, where the stalks drop between\r\nthe rollers. An immense iron tank below, called a juice box, receives\r\nthe liquid portion, and another elevator bears the bruised and broken\r\nfragments to the opposite side of the building, where they are dropped\r\ninto the bagasse burner.\r\n\r\n\"This invention, at its introduction, caused more scientific inquiry\r\nand dispute, probably, than any other of the age, and settled beyond\r\nquestion the possibility of combustion, without the use of atmospheric\r\nair. The process consists in dropping the wet, spongy mass into a fire\r\nof wood or coal, and closing the furnace doors. The steam arising from\r\nthe drying matter passes to a chamber in the rear, where, by the intense\r\nheat, it is decomposed. Oxygen and hydrogen (both strong combustibles)\r\nunite with the carbon, reaching there in the form of smoke, and a white\r\nheat is the result.\r\n\r\n\"Cane juice, as it escapes from the mill, could scarcely be considered\r\ninviting to either palate or vision. The sweet, slimy mass of fluid,\r\ncovered with foam, and filled with sticks, has more the appearance of\r\nthe water in a brewer's vat than anything which now suggests itself. A\r\nsmall furnace, containing a quantity of burning sulphur, sends through a\r\ntube a volume of its stifling fumes, and these, caught by jets of steam,\r\nthoroughly impregnate the contents of the juice box. Having received its\r\nfirst lesson in cleanliness, the liquid now rises through a tube to the\r\nseries of clarifiers on the second floor. They are heated by a chain of\r\nsteam pipes running along the bottom, and being filled, the juice slowly\r\nsimmers Much of the foreign substance rises in a scum to the surface\r\nand is skimmed off by the sugar maker. It is further purified by the\r\naddition of Thomaston or what is called sugar lime. At one half a peck\r\nis considered sufficient for seven hundred and fifty gallons of juice,\r\nbut much depends upon the quantity of saccharine matter it contains.\r\nAnother set of pipes now permit the liquor to run into the evaporators,\r\nin the boiling room below. These are also heated by circles of steam\r\npipes, and the liquid is first gently simmered, to enable any additional\r\nforeign substance to rise to the surface and be skimmed off.\r\n\r\n\"After that the steam is turned on fully, and the juice boils until\r\nit reaches the solidity of twenty-five degrees, as measured by the\r\nsaccharometer. This point attained, more pipes conduct it to a series\r\nof square iron tanks called filterers. Each is provided with a false\r\nbottom, covered with thick woolen blankets, and through these the juice\r\nslowly drips into an immense iron vessel called a sirup tank.\r\n\r\n\"The process of cleaning has now been completed, and the sirup is pumped\r\ninto the covered vessel previously alluded to, called the vacuum pan.\r\n\r\n\"This is also heated by layers of steam pipes, and here the liquor boils\r\nuntil the process of crystallization is completed. This end achieved,\r\nanother conductor permits the substance to slowly descend to a large\r\nsquare iron tank, called a strike-pan. The process of emptying the\r\nvacuum pan is technically called a \"strike.\" We now find a reddish brown\r\nsubstance, having somewhat the appearance of soft mortar.\r\n\r\n\"Men are at hand with square wooden boxes, and while the sugar is still\r\nwarm, it is placed in rotary cylinders, protected on the inside by wire\r\nguards, called centrifugals.\r\n\r\n\"Placed on a horizontal, they revolve with a velocity which frequently\r\nreaches 1200 a minute. The damp, dingy looking pile instantly spreads, a\r\nbroad circle of yellow is first visible on the inner rim of the machine,\r\nand this slowly whitening finally becomes a shining ring of snowy sugar.\r\nTo effect this result requires the aid of nine steam boilers, three\r\nsteam engines, a vacuum pan, three large evaporators, five clarifiers,\r\nfive filters, an immense sirup tank, the juice box, mill, bagasse\r\nfurnace, and fifteen coolers.\r\n\r\n\"With the engineers, sugar makers, firemen, and laborers, thirty-eight\r\npersons are constantly on duty in this sugar-house.\r\n\r\n\"Doubling this number, to give each the necessary rest, swells the\r\ngathering to seventy-six souls, who, during the grinding season, find\r\nemployment at the sugar-house alone. This of course does not include the\r\nlaborers employed in gathering and bringing in the crop, and the\r\ngreat number occupied in odd jobs and the extensive repairs which are\r\nconstantly going on.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSticking, or Court Plaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plaster is well known from its general use and its healing\r\nproperties. It is merely a kind of varnished silk, and its manufacture\r\nis very easy.\r\n\r\nBruise a sufficient quantity of isinglass, and let it soak in a little\r\nwarm water for four-and-twenty hours; expose it to heat over the fire\r\ntill the greater part of the water is dissipated, and supply its place\r\nby proof spirits of wine, which will combine with the isinglass.\r\nStrain the whole through a piece of open linen, taking care that the\r\nconsistence of the mixture shall be such that, when cool, it may form a\r\ntrembling jelly.\r\n\r\nExtend the piece of black silk, of which you propose making your\r\nplaster, on a wooden frame, and fix it in that position by means of\r\ntacks or pack-thread. Then apply the isinglass (after it has been\r\nrendered liquid by a gentle heat) to the silk with a brush of fine hair\r\n(badgers' is the best). As soon as this first coating is dried, which\r\nwill not be long, apply a second; and afterwards, if you wish the\r\narticle to be very superior, a third. When the whole is dry, cover it\r\nwith two or three coatings of the balsam of Peru.\r\n\r\nThis is the genuine court plaster. It is pliable, and never breaks,\r\nwhich is far from being the case with many of the spurious articles\r\nwhich are sold under that name. Indeed, this commodity is very\r\nfrequently adulterated. A kind of plaster, with a very thick and brittle\r\ncovering, is often sold for it. The manufacturers of this, instead of\r\nisinglass, use common glue, which is much cheaper; and cover the whole\r\nwith spirit varnish, instead of balsam of Peru. This plaster cracks, and\r\nhas none of the balsamic smell by which the genuine court plaster is\r\ndistinguished. Another method of detecting the adulteration is to\r\nmoisten it with your tongue _on the side opposite to that which is\r\nvarnished_; and, if the plaster be genuine, it will adhere exceedingly\r\nwell. The adulterated plaster is too hard for this; it will not stick,\r\nunless you moisten it on the varnished side.--_The Painter, Gilder, and\r\nVarnisher's Companion_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPROVED HOISTING PULLEY WANTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman of this city has sent us the accompanying diagram of an\r\nimproved hoisting pulley, for which he say she would be willing to pay\r\nany reasonable price provided he knew where to obtain it--the wheel, not\r\nthe price. It is a pulley within a pulley, the friction of the outer one\r\nupon the inner one--the latter being held by a ratchet and pawl-acting\r\nas a brake in lowering weights, while both would turn together in\r\nelevating weights. The idea is rather an ingenious one, but we are\r\nconfident our inventors can attain a like object by simpler means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE VACUUM METHOD OF MAKING ICE.--An ice and cold producing machine has\r\nbeen invented by Herr Franz Windhausen, Brunswick. The action of the\r\nmachine is based on the principle of producing cold by the expansion of\r\natmospheric air, which is accomplished by means of mechanical power. The\r\nmachines require no chemicals, nothing being used in them but water and\r\natmospheric air. They may be wrought by steam, water, or wind, and they\r\nproduce from 100 to 1,000 lbs. of ice per hour, according to size, at a\r\ncost of from 2d. to 5d. per 100 lbs., this difference resulting from the\r\nvarying prices of fuel and the mode of working chosen. One of their uses\r\nis to cool rooms, cellars, theaters, hospitals, compartments of ships,\r\netc.--_Builder_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERDINAND DE LESSEPS--CHIEF PROMOTER OF THE SUEZ CANAL.\r\n\r\n[From the Phrenological Journal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scheme of re-opening the canal of the Pharaohs between the\r\nMediterranean and Red seas, and thus connecting by a short cut across\r\nthe Isthmus of Suez the commerce of Europe and Asia, though long\r\nentertained by the first Napoleon, may fairly be claimed for M. de\r\nLesseps. His attention was doubtless first drawn to it by reading the\r\nmemorable report of M. la Pére, who was employed by Bonaparte to make\r\na survey in 1798. The credit of designing and executing the great work\r\nbelongs alike to him. With the general plan, progress, and purpose of\r\nthe Canal, the American reader has, during the past few months, been\r\nmade tolerably familiar.\r\n\r\nHe is the son of Jean Baptiste Barthelemi, Baron de Lesseps, who was\r\nborn at Cette, a French port on the Mediterranean, in 1765. Jean\r\nBaptiste was for five years French Vice-Consul at St. Petersburg. In\r\n1785 he accompanied La Perouse on a voyage to Kamtchatka, whence he\r\nbrought by land the papers containing a description of the expedition.\r\nIn 1788 he was Consul at Kronstadt and St. Petersburg. From St.\r\nPetersburg he was called, in 1812, by the Emperor Napoleon, to Moscow,\r\nas _intendant_. From the latter city, in 1814, he proceeded to Lisbon,\r\nand was stationed there as Consul until 1823. He died at Paris, May 6,\r\n1834.\r\n\r\nFerdinand, the subject of this sketch, was born at Versailles in 1805,\r\nand is consequently in his sixty-fourth year, though his appearance is\r\nthat of a man little past the meridian of life. Early in life he evinced\r\npeculiar aptitude for the diplomatic career in which he has since\r\ndistinguished himself--a career as varied and romantic as it is\r\nbrilliant. In 1825 he was appointed _attaché_ to the French Consulate at\r\nLisbon. Two years later found him engaged in the Commercial Department\r\nof the Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the latter part of 1828\r\nhe was _attaché_ to the Consul-General at Tunis; and in 1831 he was\r\ndispatched by his Government as Consul to Alexandria. Hard work and\r\nrapid promotion for _le jeune diplomat!_ But the most eventful period of\r\nhis long and wonderfully active career lay yet before him.\r\n\r\nSeven years subsequent to his appointment at Alexandria, and\r\nconsequently when he was in his thirty-fifth year, he was sent as\r\nConsul to Rotterdam. From Rotterdam he proceeded to Malaga in 1839, to\r\nnegotiate in behalf of French commerce with the Spanish Government. In\r\nthe latter part of the same year he was transferred to the Consulate\r\nat Barcelona, where during the two subsequent years he was especially\r\nactive, and signally distinguished himself against the reign of\r\nEspartero. In 1844 we again find him in Alexandria, whither he was sent\r\nto take the place of Lavalette. But the time for the development of his\r\ngreat project had not yet come. He did not long remain in the Egyptian\r\ncapital. Returning to his former position in Barcelona he was witness\r\nto some of the scenes of the revolution of February. In 1848 he was\r\nappointed French Minister at the court of Madrid. Remaining in the\r\nSpanish capital about a year, he returned to Paris immediately after the\r\nrevolution of '48, and in May of the following year was dispatched as\r\nEnvoy of the French Republic to the Republican Government of Mazzini at\r\nRome, where he took a leading part in the abortive negotiations which\r\npreceded the restoration of the Pope by a French army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1854 he received a commission from the _Sociéte d'études du Canal de\r\nSuez_ at Paris to negotiate with Säid Pacha for the construction of the\r\ncanal projected in 1816. Accordingly, toward the close of that year, we\r\nagain find him on the Isthmus, preparing for his great work. This time\r\nhe came to conquer. His mission was crowned with success, and the\r\nnecessary concession made in November of that year. A palace and a\r\nretinue of servants were assigned to his use, and he was treated, as\r\na guest of the Viceroy, with the utmost respect. Great opposition\r\nfollowed, especially from England; and it was not till January, 1856,\r\nthat the second and fuller concession was granted by Säid Pacha, and a\r\n_Compagnie International_ fully organized.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 M. Lesseps succeeded in raising two hundred millions of francs\r\nin France, and in 1859 he proceeded to Egypt and planted the Egyptian\r\nflag in the harbor of the ancient Pelusium, the great sea-port of Egypt\r\nthirty centuries ago, where Port Säid now stands. He laid, at the same\r\ntime, the foundation of a lighthouse, and proudly proclaimed the\r\nwork commenced. Fresh difficulties--chiefly of a political\r\nnature--interposed, but the indefatigable Lesseps never despaired. In\r\n1859 he had the satisfaction of seeing his company and work placed upon\r\na firm footing, though the final decision of the French Emperor was not\r\ngiven till July, 1864. From that time to the present hour the Canal has\r\nsteadily progressed toward completion.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of M. de Lesseps is very striking. Though long\r\npast middle age, he has a fresh and even youthful appearance. Both face\r\nand figure are well preserved; his slightly curling gray hair sets off\r\nin pleasing contrast his bronzed yet clear complexion, his bright eye,\r\nand genial smile. He is somewhat over the medium stature, possessed of\r\na compact and well-knit frame, carries his head erect, and moves about\r\nwith a buoyancy and animation perfectly marvelous in one of his years\r\nand experience. His address is that of the well-bred, well-educated\r\nFrench gentleman that he is. His manner is winning, his voice clear and\r\nunder most excellent control, as all those who have listened to his\r\nadmirable lectures on the Canal at the late Paris Exposition cannot\r\nfail to remember. What is perhaps most remarkable in a man so bred and\r\nconstituted, is that with great gentleness of speech and suavity of\r\nmanner he combines a strength of will and fixity of purpose worthy of\r\nNapoleon or Caesar himself. Beneath that calm exterior lay a power which\r\nneeded but the stimulus of a great idea to develop.\r\n\r\nThough beset by difficulties, laughed at, and maligned, he has never for\r\na moment swerved from his purpose or relaxed his efforts to accomplish\r\nit. Neither the sneers of Stevenson and his associate engineers, the\r\nheavy broadside of the \"Thunderer,\" or the squibs of _Punch_, ever made\r\nany visible impression on the purpose or action of Lesseps.--\"My purpose\r\nfrom the commencement was to have confidence,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHow bravely he has maintained his principle and redeemed his pledge let\r\nthe ceremonies which marked the completion and inauguration of his great\r\nwork tell--when sea sent greeting to sea; and let the keels of richly\r\nladen argosies from Cathay and from Ind, which plow the waters of the\r\nCanal, declare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INGENIOUS VENT PEG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engraving illustrates an English invention of value in that it\r\nprovides a means of giving vent to casks from which liquids are to\r\nbe drawn, at the same time excluding the air when the drawing is\r\ndiscontinued, and thus preventing deterioration in the liquid by undue\r\nexposure to air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe principle on which it operates is that of admitting just so much air\r\nas may be required to fill the vacant space produced by the withdrawal\r\nof the liquor from time to time, and affording this air no egress, thus\r\nhermetically sealing the barrel. This is effected by means of a valve\r\nopening inward, at the upper portion of the peg, so long as the density\r\nof the exterior air is in excess of that within.

The lifting chain is\r\npassed over two sheaves, each of which is geared internally, the one\r\nhaving one or more teeth in excess of the other. Revolving around these\r\ninternal teeth is a pinion, actuated by an eccentric, which is keyed on\r\nto a shaft passing through the center of the block, with a bearing at\r\neach end in the outside frame of the block. At one end of this shaft\r\nis a wheel with an endless hand chain passing over it; this gives the\r\nmotion to the eccentric shaft. The teeth of the internal pinion are\r\nbroad enough to gear into the teeth of both the sheaves, but as there is\r\nmore teeth in one than in the other, they (the teeth) are not exactly\r\nopposite each other, and therefore will not admit the teeth of the\r\nrevolving pinion without moving; but the tooth of the pinion, acting as\r\na wedge, and entering with great power, pushes the one tooth forward and\r\nthe other tooth back; and this continually occurring, a continual rotary\r\nmotion is given to the sheaves, in opposite directions, with a power\r\nwhich is proportioned to the number of the teeth, the throw of\r\neccentric, and the leverage gained by the diameter of the hand wheel.\r\nThe lifting chain is passed over the one sheave, then down, and up over\r\nthe other, the two ends being attached to a powerful cross bar, to which\r\nis connected the lifting hook. By this means the weight is distributed\r\nover the two sheaves and the two parts of the chain, increasing the\r\nsafety and diminishing the friction of the block.\r\n\r\n\"The blocks are very simple in construction, and are not at all liable\r\nto get out of order; the construction being such that the weight cannot\r\nrun down, though the men lifting let go the chain. They hang quite plumb\r\nwhen in action, and the men are able to stand clear away from under the\r\nload, as the hand-wheel chain can be worked at any angle.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants In Sleeping Rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following from the able pen of Dr. J.C. Draper, in the January\r\nnumber of the _Galaxy_, will answer some inquiries lately received on\r\nthe subject, and is a brief, but clear exposition of the injurious\r\neffects of plants in sleeping apartments:\r\n\r\n\"Though the air is dependent for the renewal of its oxygen on the action\r\nof the green leaves of plants, it must not be forgotten that it is only\r\nin the presence and under the stimulus of light that these organisms\r\ndecompose carbonic acid. All plants, irrespective of their kind or\r\nnature, absorb oxygen and exhale carbonic acid in the dark. The quantity\r\nof noxious gas thus eliminated is, however, exceedingly small when\r\ncompared with the oxygen thrown out during the day. When they are\r\nflowering, plants exhale carbonic acid in considerable quantity, and at\r\nthe same time evolve heat. In this condition, therefore, they resemble\r\nanimals as regards their relation to the air; and a number of plants\r\nplaced in a room would, under these circumstances, tend to vitiate the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"While the phanerogamia, or flowering plants, depend on the air almost\r\nentirely for their supply of carbon, and are busy during the day in\r\nrestoring to it the oxygen that has been removed by animals, many of the\r\ninferior cryptogamia, as the fungi and parasitic plants, obtain their\r\nnourishment from material that has already been organized. They do not\r\nabsorb carbonic acid, but, on the contrary, they act like animals,\r\nabsorbing oxygen and exhaling carbonic acid at all times. It is,\r\ntherefore, evident that their presence in a room cannot be productive of\r\ngood results.\r\n\r\n\"Aside from the highly deleterious action that plants may exert on the\r\natmosphere of a sleeping room, by increasing the proportion of carbonic\r\nacid during the night, there is another and more important objection to\r\nbe urged against their presence in such apartments. Like animals, they\r\nexhale peculiar volatile organic principles, which in many instances\r\nrender the air unfit for the purposes of respiration. Even in the days\r\nof Andronicus this fact was recognized, for he says, in speaking of\r\nArabia Felix, that 'by reason of myrrh, frankincense, and hot spices\r\nthere growing, the air was so obnoxious to their brains, that the\r\nvery inhabitants at some times cannot avoid its influence.' What the\r\ninfluence on the brains of the inhabitants may have been does not at\r\npresent interest us: we have only quoted the statement to show that long\r\nago the emanations from plants were regarded as having an influence on\r\nthe condition of the air; and, in view of our present ignorance, it\r\nwould be wise to banish them from our sleeping apartments, at least\r\nuntil we are better informed regarding their true properties.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPATENT OFFICE ILLUSTRATIONS.--We are indebted to Messrs.

We have frequently had occasion to commend the skill and\r\nfidelity of these illustrations. They are most admirably done, and the\r\nvalue of our Patent Office Reports is much enhanced thereby. In fact\r\nwithout these illustrations the reports would be of little value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Treadle Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the ordinary means employed to propel light\r\nmachinery by the foot are fatiguing in the extreme and although the best\r\nof these is the rock shaft with foot pieces, employed almost universally\r\nin modern sewing machines, this requires the operator to sit bolt\r\nupright, a position very trying to the back, and one which has been\r\nshown to be productive of weakness and even permanent disease.\r\n\r\nThe device shown in the engraving employs only the swinging motion of\r\nthe leg to generate the required power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOODES' IMPROVED TREADLE MOTION.]\r\n\r\nA pendulum, A, is pivoted to the underside of the table and carries a\r\nheavy disk, B. To the central pivot of B is attached a foot piece, C.\r\nThe bottom of B is slotted, and through the slot passes a stationary\r\nrod, D, which holds the bottom of the disk from vibrating while it\r\ncauses the upper part to reciprocate with the swinging of A.\r\n\r\nTo the upper part of B is pivoted a pitman which actuates the crank as\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nIn operation the foot is placed upon the foot piece, and a swinging\r\nmotion is imparted by it to the pendulum, which is ultimately converted\r\ninto rotary motion by the crank as described. The heavy disk, B, gives\r\nsteadiness to the motion, and acts in concert with the fly wheel on the\r\ncrank shaft for this purpose; but it is not essential that this part of\r\nthe device should be a disk; any equivalent may be substituted for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nPatented, through the Scientific American Patent Agency, Oct, 26, 1869,\r\nby E.

It is a barrow, with arms and\r\nbraces covered with cloth, and having on one side a slot, which admits\r\nthe stem of the tree. The curculio catcher, or machine, is run against\r\nthe tree three or four times, with sufficient force to impart a jarring\r\nmotion to all its parts. The operator then backs far enough to bring the\r\nmachine to the center of the space between the rows, turns round, and in\r\nlike manner butts the tree in the opposite row. In this way a man may\r\noperate on three hundred trees per hour.\r\n\r\nA bag and a broom are carried by the operator by which the insects are\r\nswept from the cloth and consigned to destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURCULIO CATCHER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemains of a Megatherium in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Columbus _State Journal_, of Dec. 6, says \"there is now on\r\nexhibition at the rooms of the State Board of Agriculture, or\r\nheadquarters of the Geological Corps, a section of the femur or thigh\r\nbone of an animal of the mastodon species, the fossilized remains of\r\nwhich were recently discovered in Union county. These remains were found\r\nin a drift formation about three feet below the surface, and are similar\r\nto the remains of the Megatherium found in other parts of the State.\r\nArrangements were made by Mr. Klippart, of the Geological Corps, to\r\nhave the skeleton or the parts thereof removed with proper care. Before\r\nexcavations had proceeded far bad weather set in, and work has been\r\nabandoned. The section of the femur, upper part, with socket ball, is\r\nabout twenty inches in length, or about half the length of the thigh\r\nbone. This would make the aggregate length of the bones of the leg about\r\nten feet. The ball is twenty-two inches in circumference, and the bone\r\nlower down, of course, much larger. From the part of the skeleton\r\nsecured, it is estimated that the hight of the animal was twelve and a\r\nhalf feet, and the skeleton entire much larger than the specimen now in\r\nthe British Museum. As this particular species, or remains thereof, have\r\nbeen found only in Ohio, this specimen has been named the _Megatharium\r\nOhioensis_. The animals lived, it is supposed, in the period immediately\r\npreceding the human period, and were after the elephant type.\"\r\n\r\nExhuming operations will be resumed in the spring, and if the skeleton\r\nis removed in good shape or a good state of preservation, it will be set\r\nup in the Echo room at the Capitol, where the fossils collected by the\r\nGeological Corps are now being arranged and stored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtificial Ivory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA process for producing artificial ivory has been published in a German\r\njournal. The inventor makes a solution of india-rubber in chloroform and\r\npasses chlorine gas through it. After this, he heats the solution to\r\ndrive off any excess of chlorine, and also the solvent, whereupon he has\r\nleft behind a pasty mass with which it is only necessary to incorporate\r\nsufficient precipitated carbonate of lime or sulphate of lead, or,\r\nindeed, any other dense white powder, to obtain a material which may be\r\npressed into molds to form whatever articles may be desired. The details\r\nof this process are obviously incomplete, and the success of it may be\r\ndoubted. Only good and well masticated rubber could be employed, and\r\neven then a dilute solution must be made, and any earthy impurities\r\nallowed to deposit. In the next place, we are doubtful of the bleaching\r\naction of chlorine on rubber, and, moreover, chloroform is, under some\r\ncircumstances, decomposed by chlorine. Lastly, it is clear that, to\r\nobtain a hard material at all resembling ivory, it would be necessary to\r\nmake a \"hard cure,\" for which a considerable proportion of sulphur\r\nwould be required. The simple purification of india-rubber by means of\r\nchloroform, would, however, furnish a mass of a very fair color.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn iron car made of cylindrical form is now used on the Bengal Railway,\r\nfor the carriage of cotton and other produce.

The\r\nwhole subject of American as contrasted with English railroad practice\r\nis reviewed, and the differences which exist, with the necessities for\r\nsuch differences ably discussed. Mr. Colburn shows these differences\r\nto be external rather than fundamental, and traces many of the\r\npeculiarities of American construction to the \"initiative of English\r\nengineers.\" The cause for the adoption and retention of these\r\npeculiarities he attributes to \"the necessities of a new country and the\r\ncomparative scarcity of capital,\" and thinks that but for these causes\"\r\nAmerican railways and their rolling stock would have doubtless been\r\nconstructed, as in other countries, upon English models, and worked, in\r\nmost respects, upon English principles of management.\r\n\r\nHe reviews the origin and introduction of American features of railway\r\npractice, and points out as the distinguishing feature of American\r\nlocomotives and rolling stock the bogie, or swiveling truck. \"Keeping\r\nin mind the distinguishing merits of the bogie, the other differences\r\nbetween English and American locomotives are differences more of costume\r\nand of toilet than of vital principles of construction.\"\r\n\r\nThe author attributes the origin of the greater subdivision of rolling\r\nweight and consequent coupling of wheels on American roads to the\r\ncomparatively weak and imperfect permanent way, estimating the maximum\r\nweight per wheel as being for many years four English tuns, while three\r\ntuns he considers, as more than the average for each coupled wheel of\r\nAmerican locomotives.\r\n\r\nTo follow the author through the whole of his able paper, and the\r\ndiscussion which it elicited, would occupy more of our space than we\r\ncan spare for the purpose. We will, however, give in the author's own\r\nlanguage, an account of an experiment conducted by him in 1855 on the\r\nErie Railroad.\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1855, the author, at the request of Mr. (now\r\nGeneral) M'Callum, the manager of the Erie Railroad, took charge of an\r\nexperimental train, which he ran over the whole length of the line and\r\nback, a total distance of nearly 900 miles. The same engine was employed\r\nthroughout the run, occupying in all nearly three weeks, making an\r\naverage for each week day of about 50 miles. The line is divided into\r\nfour divisions, varying considerably in respect of gradients, and the\r\nutmost load the engine could draw was taken in both directions over each\r\ndivision. The maximum inclinations were 1 in 88. The results of the\r\nexperiments were so voluminous, that it will be sufficient to detail\r\nthe particulars of what may be termed crucial tests of adhesion and\r\nresistance to traction.\r\n\r\n\"The engine had four coupled wheels and a bogie, the total weight in\r\nworking trim being 29½ tuns, of which 17-7/8 tuns rested on the coupled\r\nwheels available for adhesion. The coupled wheels were 5 feet in\r\ndiameter; the outside cylinders were 17 inches in diameter, and the\r\nstroke 24 inches. The safety valves were set to blow off at 130 lbs.,\r\nand the steam, as observed by a Bourdon gage, was seldom allowed to\r\nexceed that limit. No indicator diagrams were taken, nor was any measure\r\ntaken of the wood burnt, all that could be consumed by the engine, in\r\nmaintaining the requisite steam, being supplied. The tender, loaded,\r\nweighed 181 tuns. The train drawn consisted of eight-wheel wagons fully\r\nloaded with deals. The average weight of each wagon was 5 tuns 8 cwt. 3\r\nqrs., and of each wagon with its load 15 tuns 5 cwt. 3 qrs. nearly. The\r\nwagons had cast-iron chilled wheels, each 2 feet 6 inches in diameter,\r\nwith inside journals 3 7/8 inches in diameter, and 8 inches long. All\r\nthe wagons had been put in complete order, and the journals, fitted with\r\noil-tight boxes, were kept well oiled. The gage of the line was 6 feet.\r\nThe weather was most favorable, clear and dry, with the exception of a\r\nsingle day of heavy rain.\r\n\r\n\"Upon about one hundred miles of the line, forming a portion of the\r\nSusquehanna division, a train of one hundred wagons, weighing, with\r\nengine and tender, 1,572 tuns was taken. The train was a few feet more\r\nthan half a mile in length.\r\n\r\n\"At one point it was stopped where the line commenced an ascent of 24\r\nfeet in four miles, averaging 1 in 880 up for the whole distance. There\r\nwere also long and easy curves upon this portion. The train was taken up\r\nand purposely stopped on the second mile, to be sure of starting again\r\nwith no aid from momentum. The average speed was 5 miles an hour, and\r\nneither was the pressure of steam increased nor sand used except in\r\nstarting from the stops purposely made. The engine, even were its full\r\nboiler pressure of 130 lbs. maintained as effective pressure upon the\r\npistons throughout the whole length of their stroke, could not have\r\nexerted a tractive force greater than (17 x 17 x 130 lbs. x 2 ft.)/ 5\r\nft = 15,028 lbs.; nor is it at all probable that the effective cylinder\r\npressure could have approached this limit by from 10 lbs. to 15 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch. Supposing, however, for the sake of a reductio ad absurdum,\r\nthat the full boiler pressure had been maintained upon the pistons for\r\nthe whole length of their strokes, the adhesion of the coupled driving\r\nwheels, not deducting the internal resistances of the engine, would have\r\nbeen 15028/40050 3/8 of the weight upon them. In any case there was\r\na resistance of 4,011 lbs. due to gravity, and if even 120 lbs. mean\r\neffective cylinder pressure be assumed, corresponding to a total\r\ntractive force of 13,872 lbs., the quotient representing the rolling and\r\nother resistances, exclusive of gravity, would be but 6.27 lbs. per tun\r\nof the entire train; a resistance including all the internal resistances\r\nof the engine, the resistance of the curves, easy although they were,\r\nand the loss in accelerating and retarding the train in starting and\r\nstopping. This estimate of resistance would correspond, at the observed\r\nspeed of 5 miles an hour (upwards of ¾ of an hour having been consumed\r\non the 4 miles), to 185 indicated H.P., which, with the driving wheels,\r\nmaking but 28 revolutions per minute, would be the utmost that an engine\r\nwith but 1,038 square feet of heating surface could be expected to\r\nexert. This was the highest result observed during the three weeks'\r\ntrial, but one or two others are worthy of mention. On the Delaware\r\ndivision of the same line, the train, of 1,572 tuns' weight, was run\r\nover 5 consecutive miles of absolutely level line, at a mean rate of\r\n9.23 miles an hour, and during the same day, over 5 other consecutive\r\nmiles of level at a mean rate of 9.7 miles per hour. On both levels\r\nthere were 14½ chain curves of good length, and the speed, from 9 to 12\r\nmiles an hour, at which the train entered the respective levels, was not\r\nquite regularly maintained throughout the half hour expended in running\r\nover them. But if even 7 lbs. per tun of the total weight be taken as\r\nthe resistance at these speeds, the tractive force will be 11,004 lbs.,\r\nwhich is more than one fourth the adhesion weight of 40,050 lbs. On\r\nthe next day, the same engine drew 30 wagons weighing 466½ tuns, or,\r\nincluding engine and tender, 514 tuns nearly, up a gradient of 1 in\r\n117½, three miles long, at a mean speed of 10¼ miles an hour. The\r\nresistance due to gravity was 9,814 lbs., and supposing the other\r\nresistance to traction to amount to no more than 7 lbs. per tun, the\r\ntotal resistance would be 13,412 lbs., corresponding to a mean effective\r\ncylinder pressure of 117 lbs. per square inch, and to a co-efficient of\r\nadhesion of almost exactly one third.\r\n\r\n\"It is needless to repeat instances of much the same kind, as occurring\r\nduring the experiment referred to. The author is bound to say that they\r\nwere, no doubt, influenced by the favorable circumstances of weather,\r\nand something is to be allowed also for the great length of train drawn,\r\nvery long trains having a less tractive resistance per tun on a level\r\nthan short ones, and something, possibly more than is commonly supposed,\r\nmay have been due to the use of oil-tight axle boxes, the saponaceous\r\ncompound known as 'railway grease' being nowhere in use on railways in\r\nthe States. It could not possibly be used, except in a congealed form,\r\nin the severe American winters; and Messrs. Guebhard and Dieudonné's\r\nexperiments (_vide_ \"De la résistance des trains et de la puissance des\r\nmachines.\" 8vo. Paris, 1868, p. 36) made in 1867, on the Eastern Railway\r\nof France, showed a very considerable diminution in the resistance of\r\noil-boxed rolling stock as compared with that fitted with grease boxes.\r\nBut, weighed upon the other hand, are the facts, first, that the line\r\nwas of 6-feet gage, and, _pro tanto_, so much the worse for traction;\r\nsecondly, that the wheels were comparatively small, and the inside\r\njournals of comparatively large diameter, the ratio of the former to the\r\nlatter being as 7¾ to 1, instead of 12 to 1 as on English lines. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that the length and steadiness of the double bogie\r\ngoods wagons, scarcely liable as they are to lateral vibrations, had not\r\nsomething to do with the result, which is in some respects unique in the\r\nhistory of railway traction. The result, although not absolutely showing\r\nthe real resistance to traction, nor the real adhesion of the engine,\r\npresents this alternative; namely, that the resistance must have been\r\nunusually small, or the adhesion unusually large.\"\r\n\r\nIn the discussion which followed some doubts were expressed as to the\r\naccuracy of Mr. Colburn's conclusions, drawn from the experiments\r\ndescribed; but it was conceded by some who took part in the discussion\r\nthat some of the features of our practice might be advantageously copied\r\nin England. For the most part, however, the opinion prevailed that the\r\nfeatures of our system, which are here regarded as almost indispensable,\r\ncould not be introduced into English practice with advantage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER COVERING.\r\n\r\nBY C.M. O'HARA, C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the regular weekly meeting of the Polytechnic Association of the\r\nAmerican Institute, held on Thursday evening, the 25th ult., the subject\r\nof boiler clothing was discussed at some length, but without any\r\ndecisive conclusion being arrived at respecting the most serviceable and\r\neconomical material for that purpose. It appeared from the testimony\r\nadduced, that though there is a variety of substances in use, even those\r\nwhich are practically acknowledged as being the most efficient are\r\nfar from coming up to the required standard of utility, and are\r\ncharacterized by defects which are at once forced upon us by a little\r\nclose examination. Felt is an admirable non-conductor of heat, but owing\r\nto its combustible nature it is quite unreliable when subject to the\r\nheat of a high pressure of steam. A large fragment of this material\r\nwhich had been taken off the boiler of a North River steamboat was\r\nexhibited at the meeting, scorched and charred as if it had been exposed\r\nto the direct action of fire. For these reasons felt covering is,\r\ngenerally speaking, confined to boilers in which a comparatively low\r\npressure of steam is maintained. But even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances of actual wear its durability is limited to a short\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nPowdered charcoal possesses the elements of efficiency as a\r\nnon-conductor in an eminent degree; but its susceptibility of taking\r\nfire militates strongly against its adoption as a boiler covering.\r\n\r\nBesides the materials above mentioned, there are some which come under\r\nthe denomination of cements; but the use of such is somewhat at variance\r\nwith what a dull world would call \"facts.\" Employing them as a clothing\r\nfor a vessel in which it is necessary to retain heat is certainly the\r\nwrong way of doing a light thing, if the evidence of distinguished\r\nexperimenters be worth anything.\r\n\r\nThe researches of most well-informed physical philosophers go to prove\r\nthat the conducting properties of bodies are augmented by cohesion, and\r\nthat heat is conveyed profusely and energetically through all solid and\r\nponderable substances. Thus gold, silver, and others of the most solid\r\nmetals are the best conductors. Next to the pure metals in conducting\r\npowers are rocks, flints, porcelain, earthenware, and the denser liquids\r\nas the solutions of the acids and alkalies. As a further evidence to\r\nprove that the passage of heat through all substances is increased\r\nby cohesion, even some of those which are known to be among the best\r\nconductors are deprived of this property by a division or disintegration\r\nof their particles. Pure silica in the state of hard, rock crystal is\r\na better conductor than bismuth or lead; but if the rock crystal be\r\npulverized, the diffusion of heat through its powder is very slow and\r\nfeeble. Heat is conducted swiftly and copiously through transparent\r\nrock salt, but pulverization converts the solid mass into a good\r\nnon-conductor. Caloric has for the same reason a stronger affinity for\r\npure metals than for their oxides.\r\n\r\nAgain, wood is known to be a better non-conductor when reduced to\r\nshavings or sawdust than when in the solid state. It is probably on this\r\naccount that trees are protected by bark, which is not nearly so dense\r\nand hard a body as the wood. Wool, silk, and cotton are much diminished\r\nin conducting qualities when spun and woven, for the reason that their\r\nfibers are brought closer together.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford discovered that hot water, at a given temperature, when\r\nplaced in a vessel jacketed with a clothing of twisted silk, and plunged\r\ninto a freezing mixture, cooled down to 185° Fah. in 917 seconds. But\r\nwhen the same vessel was clothed with an equal thickness of raw silk,\r\nwater at the same heat and under the same process required 1,264 seconds\r\nbefore it reached the same decrease of temperature. It was also found\r\nby Sir Humphry Davy that even metals became non-conductors when their\r\ncohesion was destroyed by reducing them to the gaseous state.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that, heat being motion, anything, which,\r\nby the cohesion of particles, preserves the continuity of the molecular\r\nchain along which the motion is conveyed, must augment calorific\r\ntransmission. On the other hand, when there is a division or\r\ndisintegration of atoms, such as exists in sawdust, powdered charcoal,\r\nfurs, and felt, the particles composing such bodies are separated from\r\neach other by spaces of air, which the instructed among us well know are\r\ngood non-conductors of heat. The motion has, therefore, to pass from\r\neach particle of matter to the air, and again from the air to the\r\nparticle adjacent to it. Hence, it will be readily seen, that in\r\nsubstances composed of separate or divided particles, the thermal\r\nbridge, so to speak, is broken, and the passage of heat is obstructed\r\nby innumerable barriers of confined air. The correctness of\r\nthese assumptions has been so abundantly proved by experimental\r\ndemonstrations, that every mind that is tolerably informed on the\r\nsubject must be relieved of every shade of doubt respecting the greatly\r\nsuperior non-conducting powers which bodies consisting of separate atoms\r\npossess over those of a solid concrete nature.\r\n\r\nThe next matter of interest connected with the subject under notice is\r\nits relation to the philosophy of radiation. It has long been known that\r\nthe emission of heat from a polished metallic surface is very slight,\r\nbut from a surface of porcelain, paper, or charcoal, heat is discharged\r\nprofusely. Even many of the best non-conductors are powerful radiators,\r\nand throw off heat with a repellent energy difficult to conceive.\r\n\r\n\"If two equal balls of thin, bright silver,\" says Sir John Leslie, \"one\r\nof them entirely uncovered and the other sheathed in a case of cambric,\r\nbe filled with water slightly warmed and then suspended in a close room,\r\nthe former will lose only eleven parts in the same time that the latter\r\nwill dissipate twenty parts.\" The superior heat-retaining capacity which\r\na clean tin kettle possesses over one that has been allowed to\r\ncollect smoke and soot, lies within the compass of the most ordinary\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of the eminent philosopher just mentioned furnish a\r\nvariety of suggestions on the radiation from heated surfaces. He found\r\nthat, while the radiating power of clean lead was only 19, it rose to 45\r\nwhen tarnished by oxidation, that the radiating power of plumbago\r\nwas 75, and that of red lead 80. He also discovered that, while the\r\nradiating power of gold, silver, and polished tin was only 12, that\r\nof paper was 98, and lamp black no less than 100. He further says: \"A\r\nsilver pot will emit scarcely half as much heat as one of porcelain. The\r\naddition of a flannel, though indeed a slow conductor, far from checking\r\nthe dissipation of heat, has directly a contrary tendency, for it\r\npresents to the atmosphere a surface of much greater propulsive\r\nenergy, which would require a thickness of no less than three folds to\r\ncounterbalance.\"\r\n\r\nIt is safe to infer from this analogy that the felt covering of boilers\r\nshould not only be of considerable thickness, but should be protected\r\nby an external jacketing of some sort; for, though felt is a good\r\nnon-conductor, it is a powerful absorber and radiator, more especially\r\nwhen it has been allowed to contract soot and dust.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have lead to the general conclusion that the\r\npower of absorption is always in the same proportion as the power of\r\nradiation. It must be so. Were any substance a powerful radiator and at\r\nthe same time a bad absorber, it would necessarily radiate faster than\r\nit would absorb, and its reduction of temperature would continue without\r\nlimit. It has, furthermore, been proved that the absorptive property of\r\nsubstances increases as their reflecting qualities diminish. Hence, the\r\nradiating power of a surface is inversely as its reflecting power. It is\r\nfor this reason that the polished metallic sheathing on the cylinders\r\nof locomotive engines, and on the boilers of steam fire engines, is\r\nnot only ornamental but essentially useful. Decisive tests have also\r\nestablished the fact that radiation is effected more or less by color.\r\n\"A black porcelain tea pot,\" observes Dr. Lardner, \"is the worst\r\nconceivable material for that vessel, for both its material and color\r\nare good radiators of heat, and the liquid contained in it cools with\r\nthe greatest possible rapidity; a polished silver or brass tea urn is\r\nmuch better adapted to retain the heat of the water than one of a dull\r\nbrown, such as is most commonly used.\"\r\n\r\nA few facts like those above stated afford more decisive information\r\nregarding the nature of heat than columns of theory or speculation. Yet\r\nit is rather strange that when so many learned and reliable men have,\r\nexperimented so much and commented with such persuasiveness upon the\r\nsubtile agency of heat and the vast amount of waste that must accrue by\r\ninjudicious management, comparatively few have availed themselves of the\r\nunited labors of these indefatigable pyrologists; manufacturing owners\r\nand corporations still persisting in having their steam boilers painted\r\nblack or dull red and leaving them exposed to the atmosphere. Some\r\npersons, who pass themselves off very satisfactorily as clever\r\nengineers, affect a contempt for the higher branches of science, and\r\nassert, in a very positive and self-sufficient manner that experiments\r\nmade in a study or laboratory are on too trifling and small a scale to\r\nbe practically relied upon; that a tin kettle or a saucepan is a very\r\ndifferent thing to the boiler of a steam engine.\r\n\r\nThis may be so in one sense, but the same chemical forces which operate\r\nupon the one will be just as active in a proportionate degree in their\r\naction upon the other. It was said by Aristotle that the laws of the\r\nuniverse are best observed in the most insignificant objects; for the\r\nsame physical causes which hold together the stupendous frame of the\r\nuniverse may be recognized even in a drop of rain. The same observation\r\nmay be applied to the laws of heat in all their ramifications; for,\r\nafter all, our experiments are, in many instances but defective copies\r\nof what is continually going on in the great workshop of nature.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to insist on the wasteful and destructive effects\r\nproduced by the exposure of boiler surfaces to the open atmosphere.\r\nSuch a practice can be neither supported by experience nor justified by\r\nanalogy; and it is to be hoped that it may before long be consigned to\r\nthe limbo of antiquated absurdities and be satisfactorily forgotten.\r\nSeeing that it cannot with any show of reason be affirmed that the\r\nboiler covering materials in present use possess the requirements\r\nnecessary to recommend them; the question arises as to what is the best\r\nmeans of achieving the object required. This is an inquiry which it is\r\nthe office of time alone to answer. As the problem is obviously one of\r\nprimary importance, and well worthy of the attention of inventors, it\r\nis hazarding nothing to predict its satisfactory solution at no distant\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is, boilers have of late become gigantic foes to\r\nhuman life. Explosions have increased, are increasing, and should be\r\ndiminished; and they are, in many instances, caused by boilers being\r\nstrained and weakened by sudden contraction from having their surfaces\r\nexposed when the fire has been withdrawn from them. Boilers are also\r\nmaterially injured by the excessive furnace heat which it is necessary\r\nto maintain to compensate for the large amount of caloric which\r\nis dissipated from their surfaces, not only by radiation but from\r\nabsorption by the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs the views here laid down are drawn exclusively from the region of\r\nfact and experiment, it is to be hoped that an enlightened sense of\r\nself-interest may prompt those whom the subject may concern, to give it\r\nthat special attention which its importance demands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment of Saws to Swing-Frames.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo insure the efficiency of mill-saws, it is highly important to have\r\nthem firmly secured in the frames by which they are reciprocated.\r\nSwing-frames for carrying saws are ordinarily of wrought iron or steel,\r\nand made up of several pieces mortised and tenoned together in the form\r\nof a rectangular frame or parallelogram, of which the longest sides are\r\ntermed verticals and the shortest crossheads or crossrails. In the case\r\nof deal frames, the swing frame differs somewhat from that of a timber\r\nframe, in having two extra verticals, which separate it into two equal\r\ndivisions. These are necessary in order that two deals may be operated\r\nupon simultaneously, each division being devoted to a separate deal, and\r\nlikewise to enable the connecting-rod which works the frame to pass up\r\nthe center and oscillate on a pin near the top, thereby avoiding the\r\ndeep excavations and costly foundations required where the rod is\r\nengaged with the pin at the bottom. The rack that advances the deals to\r\nthe saws passes through a \"bow\" in the connecting-rod and the middle\r\nof the frame, the deals are placed on either side of it, on rollers\r\npurposely provided. In sawing hard deals, the saws require to be\r\nsharpened about every tenth run or journey, and every twentieth for\r\nsoft. Fifty runs, or one hundred deals, are reckoned an average day's\r\nwork; this is inclusive of the time required for changing the saws,\r\nreturning the rack for another run, and other exigencies. For attachment\r\nto swing-frames the saws have buckles riveted to them; these are by\r\nvarious modes connected to the crossheads. Each top buckle is passed\r\nthrough the crosshead and is pierced with a mortise for the reception\r\nof a thin steel wedge or key, by whose agency the blade is strained and\r\ntightened. The edge of the crosshead upon which the keys bed is steeled\r\nto lessen the wear invariably ensuing from frequently driving up the\r\nkeys. The distances between the blades are adjusted by interposing\r\nstrips of wood, or packing pieces, as they are termed, of equal\r\nthickness with the required boards or leaves; the whole is then pressed\r\ntogether and held in position by packing screws. The saws themselves are\r\nsubsequently tightened by forcing home the keys until a certain amount\r\nof tension has been attained, this is ascertained only by the peculiar\r\nsound which emanates from the blade on being drawn considerably tight\r\nand tense. Great experience is required to accustom the ear to the\r\ncorrect intonation, as in general the tensile strain on the saws\r\napproximates so closely to the breaking point that one or two extra taps\r\non the keys are quite sufficient to rupture them.\r\n\r\nMr. Brunel, in the government saw-mills at Woolwich, adopted a method\r\nof hanging saws by means of a weighted lever, like a Roman steelyard.\r\nA cross-shaft affixed above the saws to the cornice of the main frame\r\ncarried a lever, weighted at one end and provided with a hook or shackle\r\nat the other for engagement with the saw buckle. In using this apparatus\r\nthe blades were strained one at a time by linking the lever to the\r\nbuckle and then adjusting the movable weight until the desired tension\r\nwas acquired, after which the key was inserted into the mortise and the\r\nlever released. This arrangement is not now in common use on account of\r\nthe trouble attending its employment, and at present the saws are merely\r\nstrained by hammering up the keys. The saw blades had usually a tensile\r\nstrain of upwards of one tun per inch of breadth of blade. It is to\r\nbe further observed that the cutting edges of the saws are not quite\r\nperpendicular, but have a little lead, or their upper ends overhang the\r\nlower about three eighths of an inch or one half of an inch, according\r\nto the nature of the material to be sawn. The object of this is that the\r\nsaws may be withdrawn from the cuts in the ascending or back stroke, and\r\nallow the sawdust free escape. The eccentric actuating the mechanism for\r\nadvancing the timber to the saws is generally set in such a manner that\r\nthe feed commences just at the moment when the frame has attained half\r\nits ascending stroke, and continues until the entire stroke has been\r\ncompleted. By this regulation the saws are not liable to be suddenly\r\nchoked, but come smoothly and softly into their work.--_Worssam's\r\nMechanical Saws_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT DECISION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the matter of the application of William N. Bartholomew, assignor\r\nto J. Reckendorfer, for letters patent for a design for Rubber\r\nEraser_--Letters patent for designs have increased in importance within\r\nthe past few years. Formerly but few were granted, now many are issued.\r\nTo this day they have made so little figure in litigation that but\r\nthree reported cases are known in which design patents have come into\r\ncontroversy. With their increase, questions have arisen concerning their\r\nscope and character, which have given rise to dispute and to inquiry as\r\nto the correctness of the current practice of the office in this branch\r\nof invention. While on the one hand, it is insisted that the practice\r\nhas always been uniform, and is therefore now fixed and definite; on the\r\nother, it is asserted, that there has never been, and is not now, any\r\nwell-defined or uniform practice, either in the granting or refusal of\r\ndesign patents.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1836 made no provision for the patenting of designs. The\r\nearliest legislation upon this subject is found in the act of August 29,\r\n1842, section 3; and the only legislation upon the subject is found\r\nin this section and in section 11, of the act of March 2, 1861. The\r\ndefinition of the subject matter, or, in other words, of a \"design,\" is\r\nthe same in both acts. It is is follows:\r\n\r\n\"That any citizen, etc., who, by his, her, or their own industry,\r\ngenius, efforts, and expense, may have invented or produced any new and\r\noriginal design for a manufacture, whether of metal or other material\r\nor materials, any original design for a bust, statue, bas-relief, or\r\ncomposition in alto or basso-relievo, or any new and original impression\r\nbeing formed in marble or other material, or any new and useful pattern,\r\nor print, or picture, to be either worked into or worked on, or printed,\r\nor painted, or cast, or otherwise fixed on any article of manufacture,\r\nor any new and original shape or configuration of any article of\r\nmanufacture not known or used by others, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThis definition embraces five particulars.\r\n\r\n1. A new and original design for a manufacture.\r\n\r\n2. An original design for a bust, statue, etc.\r\n\r\n3. A new and original impression or ornament to be placed on any article\r\nof manufacture.\r\n\r\n4. A new and useful pattern, print, or picture to be worked into or\r\nworked on, or printed, or painted, or cast, or otherwise fixed on any\r\narticle of manufacture.\r\n\r\n5. A new and original shape or configuration of any article of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThe first three of these classes would seem to refer to ornament only;\r\nthe fourth to ornament, combined with utility, as in the case of trade\r\nmarks; and the fifth to new shapes or forms of manufactured articles,\r\nwhich, for some reason, were preferable to those previously adopted.\r\n\r\nThe disputed questions which have thus far arisen under these\r\ndefinitions are:\r\n\r\n1. What variations may be claimed or covered by the patent consistently\r\nwith unity of design.\r\n\r\n2. Is a new shape of an article of manufacture, whereby utility is\r\nsecured, a subject of protection under this act; and\r\n\r\n3. Is mechanical function of any kind covered by it.\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these questions, it seems to have been assumed that\r\nthe design spoken of in all parts of the sections referred to covered a\r\nfixed, unchangeable figure, that the protection of letters patent did\r\nnot extend to any variation, however slight, but that such variation\r\nconstituted a new design, might be covered by a new patent, and might\r\nsafely be used without infringement of the first. This, it is said, is\r\nthe correct theory of the law, and has been the uniform adjudication of\r\nthe Office.\r\n\r\nNeither of these statements is absolutely correct. The law by no means\r\ndefines a design with such strictness. The language is, \"new and\r\noriginal design for a manufacture,\" \"new and original impression or\r\nornament,\" \"new and original shape or configuration.\" It would seem to\r\nbe too plain for argument, that the new design, or impression, or shape,\r\nmight be so generic in its character as to admit of many variations,\r\nwhich should embody the substantial characteristics and be entirely\r\nconsistent with a substantial identity of form. Thus, if the invention\r\nwere of a design for an ornamental button, the face of which was grooved\r\nwith radial rays, it would seem that the first designer of such a button\r\nmight properly describe a button of five rays, and, having stated that\r\na greater number of rays might be used, might claim a design consisting\r\ngenerally of radial rays, or of \"five or more\" rays, and, that it could\r\nnot be necessary for him to take out a patent for each additional\r\nray that could be cut upon his button. So, if the design were the\r\nornamentation of long combs by a chain of pearls, it would seem that a\r\nclaim for such a design might be maintained against one who arranged\r\nthe pearls, either in curved or straight lines, or who used half pearls\r\nonly, and that such modifications if they had occurred to the designer,\r\nmight properly have been enumerated in his specification as possible and\r\nequivalent variations. In short, I can see no reason, under the law, why\r\ndesigns may not be generic, why what are called \"broad claims,\" may\r\nnot be made to them, and why the doctrine of artistic or aesthetic\r\nequivalents may not be applied to them.\r\n\r\nThis has been recognized to a greater or less extent in the\r\nadjudications of the courts and in the practice of the Office.\r\n\r\nOne of the reported cases is that of Booth _vs_. Garelly 1, Blatch 247.\r\nThe design is described as consisting of \"radially formed ornaments on\r\nthe face of the molds or blocks of which the button is formed, combined\r\nwith the mode of winding the covering on the same, substantially as\r\nset forth, whether the covering be of one or more colors.\" The\r\nspecification, in \"substantially\" setting forth the design, contained\r\nthis language: \"It will be obvious from the foregoing that the figures\r\ncan be changed at pleasure by giving the desired form to the face of the\r\nmold by depressions and elevations which radiate from a point, whether\r\nin the center of the mold or eccentric thereto.\"\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the case by the Court no objection was made to\r\nthis statement or claim. In the case of Root _vs_. Ball, 4 McLean 180,\r\nthe learned judge instructed the jury that \"if they should find that the\r\ndefendants had infringed the plaintiff's patent by using substantially\r\nthe same device as ornamental on the same part of the stove they would,\r\nof course, find the defendant guilty. To infringe a patent right it\r\nis not necessary that the thing patented should be adopted in every\r\nparticular; but if, as in the present case, the design and figures\r\nwere substantially adopted by the defendants, they have infringed the\r\nplaintiff's right. If they adopt the same principle the defendants are\r\nguilty. The principle of a machine is that combination of mechanical\r\npowers which produce a certain result. And in a case like the present,\r\nwhere ornaments are used for a stove, it is an infringement to adopt the\r\ndesign so as to produce substantially the same appearance.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the constant practice to grant patents for designs for fonts\r\nof type, for sets of silver plate, for a series of printers' flourishes,\r\nand the like. This class of cases has always passed without objection.\r\n\r\nTwo other cases which have arisen within the Office deserve notive.\r\nThe first was for a series of miniature shoulder straps, with emblems\r\ndenoting rank, provided with a pin, to be worn under an officer's coat,\r\nupon his vest, or as a lady's breastpin. The drawing shows eight of\r\nthese pins with emblems of rank, varying from that of second lieutenant\r\nto major-general, specification describing the brooch for a second\r\nlieutenant goes on to say: \"I propose to introduce, on some of them, the\r\ndifferent ornaments showing the respective ranks of the army, from a\r\nmajor-generalship to a second lieutenancy. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\r\n8.\"\r\n\r\nThe second case was that of an application for a monogram visiting\r\ncard, on which the name was to be inscribed or printed in the form of a\r\nmonogram. The applicant filed a drawing, showing a card upon which was\r\na monogram of his own name. In his specification he gives certain rules\r\nfor forming such monograms, and then says: \"It is manifest that the\r\nform of the letters as well as the letters themselves can be changed as\r\nrequired by circumstances or the taste of the individual for whom the\r\nmonogram is designed; and that the general form and outline of the\r\nmonogram may be varied; and indeed, must vary to be adapted to the\r\nparticular name it is required to represent.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim was for \"a monogram, visiting card, or visiting card upon\r\nwhich the name is inscribed or printed in the form of a monogram,\r\nsubstantially as herein specified.\"\r\n\r\nThis application was rejected by the Examiner and Board of\r\nExaminers-in-Chief, but was allowed by the Commissioner upon appeal.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, before and since this patent was issued, many patents\r\nhave been refused for what I have called generic designs. One man having\r\ndesigned a tack head, ornamented with radial lines, was compelled to\r\ntake out one patent for his tack with six radial lines, and another for\r\nthe same tack with eight. There are other instances of like character,\r\nbut they only serve to show that the practice of the Office has not been\r\nuniform, and that the true practice is still to be adopted and followed.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in saying, in view of the premises, that a valid\r\npatent may be granted for a new genus or class of ornaments as well as\r\nfor specific ornaments, though I do not doubt that, under the statute,\r\nevery species, variety, and individual having distinct characteristics\r\nunder such a genus might also be patented, the patent being subordinate\r\nand tributary to that which covered the class. From the nature of this\r\nsubject-matter there must always be more latitude in the issue of\r\npatents for trifling changes, or form, or outline, since it is only\r\nnecessary that such changes should constitute a new \"design\" to entitle\r\nthem to a patent of this class.\r\n\r\nThe second question relates to the elements of utility in patents for\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nUpon this point, it is said by my predecessor, in Jason Crane _ex parte_\r\nCommissioners, December-May, 1869, p. 1, that the construction which has\r\nbeen given to the act of 1842, by the Office, ever since its passage, is\r\nthat it relates to designs for ornament merely; something of an artistic\r\ncharacter as contradistinguished to those of convenience or utility.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Examiners-in-Chief, in the present case, say \"The practice\r\nof the Office has been uniform from the beginning, and has always\r\nexcluded cases like the present from the benefit of the laws relating to\r\ndesigns.\" And, again, \"The general understanding has always been that\r\nthe acts of 1842 and 1861 were intended to cover articles making\r\npretensions to artistic excellence exclusively.\"\r\n\r\nIn thus denying that a new \"shape or configuration\" of an article,\r\nwhereby utility or convenience is promoted, is the proper subject of\r\na patent under the acts referred to, the Office would seem to have\r\ninvolved itself in the absurdity that if a design is useless it may be\r\npatented; whereas, if it be useful, it is entitled to no protection.\r\n\r\nFortunately no such \"uniform practice\" has existed, and the Office is\r\nrelieved from so grievous an imputation. The practice seems to have been\r\ntaken for granted by the appellate tribunals, and, so far from being\r\nas stated, is, as nearly as possible, the reverse of it. Articles have\r\nbeen, and are being, constantly patented as designs which possess no\r\nelement of the artistic or ornamental, but are valuable solely because,\r\nby a new shape or configuration, they possess more utility than the\r\nprior forms of like articles Of this character are designs for ax heads,\r\nfor reflectors, for lamp shades, for the soles of boots and shoes, which\r\nhave been heretofore patented as designs, and to this class might be\r\nadded, with great propriety, that class of so-called \"mechanical\"\r\npatents, granted for mere changes of form, such as plowshares, fan\r\nblowers, propeller blades, and others of like character.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, my learned predecessor in Crane's case added to this\r\nnumber a box so designed as to hold with convenience a set of furs, he\r\ndid but confirm and not alter the practice of the Office, so far as it\r\ncan be gleaned from the patented cases. I am of opinion that the class\r\nof cases named in the act as arising from \"new shape or configuration\"\r\nincludes within it all those mere changes of form which involve increase\r\nof utility. This I take to be the spirit of the decision in Wooster\r\n_vs_. Crane, 2 Fisher 583. The design was of a reel in the shape of a\r\nrhombus. The learned Judge says \"In this case, the reel itself, as an\r\narticle of manufacture, is conceded to be old and not the subject of\r\na patent. The shape applied to it by the complainant is also an old,\r\nwell-known mathematical figure. Now although it does not appear that\r\nany person ever before applied this particular shape to this particular\r\narticle, I cannot think that the act quoted above was intended to secure\r\nto the complainant an exclusive right to use this well known figure in\r\nthe manufacture of reels. The act, although it does not require utility\r\nin order to secure the benefit of its provisions, does require that\r\nthe shape produced shall be the result of industry, effort genius, or\r\nexpense, and must also, I think, be held to require that the shape or\r\nconfiguration sought to be secured shall, at least, be new and original\r\nas applied to articles of manufacture. But here the shape is a common\r\none in many articles of manufacture, and its application to a reel\r\ncannot fairly be said to be the result of industry, genius, effort,\r\nand expense. No advantage whatever is pretended to be derived from the\r\nadoption of the form selected by the complainant, except the incidental\r\none of using it as a trademark. Its selection can hardly be said to be\r\nthe result of effort even; it was simply an arbitrary chance selection\r\nof one of many well-known shapes, all equally well adapted to the\r\npurpose. To hold that such an application of a common form can\r\nbe secured by letters patent, would be giving the act of 1861 a\r\nconstruction broader than I am willing to give it\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem from this language that if there had been \"advantage,\"\r\nthat is, utility in the adoption of the form of the rhombus, that it\r\nwould have found more favor in the eyes of the Court.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been well discussed in the opinion of Commissioner\r\nFoote in Crane _ex parte_. I concur in that opinion, except as to\r\nthe recital of the former practice of the Office, which a careful\r\nexamination has shown to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe third question may be readily disposed of. Modes of operation or\r\nconstruction, principles of action, combinations to secure novelty or\r\nutility of movement, or compositions of matter, can hardly be said to be\r\n\"shapes, configurations, or designs,\" but where the sole utility of the\r\nnew device arises from its new shape or configuration, I think it may\r\nfairly be included among the subjects which the act of 1842 was designed\r\nto protect.\r\n\r\nThe present case may, in view of the foregoing consideration, be\r\ndisposed of without difficulty. Letters patent are asked, by applicant,\r\nfor a new design for a rubber eraser, which consists in giving to the\r\neraser a cylindrical body, with ends beveled to an edge. The claim is\r\nfor the \"cylindrical rubber eraser provided with a wrapper or case, as\r\nherein shown and described\"\r\n\r\nIn the body of the specification the applicant describes the mode of\r\nmaking the eraser, and he also enumerates its advantages over erasers of\r\nthe ordinary forms.\r\n\r\nThe Examiner does not object to the application because of the utility\r\nof the eraser, although the Board of Examiners in Chief seem to base\r\ntheir decision upon that point alone, but he pronounces the form already\r\nold in its application to artists' stumps, and he insists that the mode\r\nof composition or construction can form no element, for the claim for a\r\ndesign patent.\r\n\r\nIn the latter statement he is undoubtedly right. These patents are\r\ngranted solely for new shapes or forms, and the form being new it is\r\nimmaterial by what process that form is attained. The composition of\r\nmatter or the mode of construction is neither \"design,\" \"shape,\" nor\r\n\"configuration,\" and must be protected, if at all, under a patent of\r\nanother kind. I cannot say that the presence of such matter in the\r\nspecification would be objectionable if description merely, but it could\r\nin no way be allowed to enter into, or to modify the claim.\r\n\r\nAs to the first ground of rejection, I think the Examiner is in error.\r\nThis purports to be a new form or shape of a distinct article of\r\nmanufacture, to wit: rubber erasers. If it be new, as thus applied, it\r\nis immaterial whether pencils, or stumps, or pen holders, or anything\r\nelse may or may not have been made cylindrical. If they are not\r\nsubstantially the same article of manufacture as erasers, the old form\r\napplied to this new article is unquestionably entitled to protection.\r\n\r\nThe applicant has not defined his invention with entire accuracy. He\r\nshould strike from his claim the words \"provided with a wrapper or\r\ncase,\" as those relate to construction and not configuration, and he\r\nshould insert the words \"having the ends beveled to an edge\" in lieu\r\nof the phrase erased, or he should adopt the usual form of claim for\r\ndesigns, viz: \"The design for a rubber eraser, as shown and described.\"\r\n\r\nAs the claim stands, it ought not to be allowed, and the decision must\r\nbe affirmed, but the applicant will be allowed to amend as suggested.\r\n\r\n(Signed) S.S.

We now present our\r\nreaders with an engraving of it and a summary of its important features,\r\nwhich doubtless render it equal if not superior to any machine of the\r\nkind in market. The frame in which the feed rollers are arranged is so\r\nhung to the frame-work of the molding machine, that it can be raised or\r\nlowered at pleasure, in order to properly adjust the feed rollers for\r\naction upon the \"stuff,\" and it is also so constructed as to permit the\r\nfeed rollers to yield in case of variations in the thickness of the\r\n\"stuff\" passing under them. The spindle of the side cutter-heads is hung\r\nin a vertical frame arranged to be moved up and down, and laterally, to\r\nadjust the cutter-head for action, and is provided at its upper end with\r\na box or bearing, whereby the bearing of the box is always kept upon the\r\nspindle instead of at different points of the same as in other machines,\r\nand this without interfering with the adjustability of the side\r\ncutter-head. Thus uneven wear is avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSS' MONITOR MOLDING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe bed of the machine is formed with a series of slots or openings\r\nprovided with bridge bars so that the cutters may act upon the edges of\r\nthe stuff without danger of injury from striking the bed. The presser\r\nshoe is also made adjustable for different thicknesses of the \"stuff\"\r\nand self-yielding to variations in thickness, by a peculiar method of\r\nhanging the bar, which carries the presser shoe, to the framework of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe clamp which holds the press block which acts upon the \"stuff\" after\r\nit has passed through the cutter, is of novel construction, and the\r\nspindle of the side cutter-heads is so arranged in connection with a\r\nloose pulley and the pulley-drums, that both cutter-heads are driven by\r\none belt and in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe bed plate is provided with springs through which the side\r\ncutter-heads are arranged, to move laterally or transversely with a\r\nbridge-plate or plates, susceptible of adjustment independent of the\r\ncutter-heads, whereby an adjustable support to the \"stuff\" is given as\r\nit passes over the line of the openings in the bed.\r\n\r\nMost machines have weighted pressure feed, but this having steel springs\r\nadjustable by a screw and hand wheel, a heavy or light pressure can be\r\napplied according to the work done or size of molding. The cutter-heads\r\nare square and slotted so that any style of molding can be stuck by\r\nputting cutters on all sides of the head, thus equalizing the cost and\r\nlessening the power. The pressure shoe is arranged to hold the \"stuff\"\r\nat the very point of contact with the cutters, and, as we have shown, is\r\nreadily adjusted to a long or short cutter, so that a small molding can\r\nbe made as smooth as a large one, and so as not to require any finishing\r\nwith sandpaper or a hand tool.\r\n\r\nThe machine has also a bevel track very useful for picture frame\r\nmolding, and a patent cap of great value for the cutters, and readily\r\napplied to any slotted head or common head. The wrenches that go with\r\nthe machine, and the common malleable iron caps for the top cylinder,\r\nare shown in detail. These machines are now running in Worcester,\r\nBoston, and Fitchburg, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.: Philadelphia, Pa.;\r\nBrattleboro, Vt.; Whitesboro, N. Y.; Charleston, S. C., and other\r\nplaces, and, it is claimed, are capable of doing better work and more of\r\nit than any machine now in use.\r\n\r\nThis machine is covered by several patents taken through the Scientific\r\nAmerican Patent Agency. It is manufactured by R. Ball & Co., of\r\nWorcester, Mass, to whom write for further information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lost Civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the last regular meeting of the American Geographical and Statistical\r\nSociety at its rooms in the Cooper Institute, Professor Newberry,\r\nof Columbia College, delivered an address on the subject of his\r\nexplorations in Utah and Arizona Territories. The speaker commenced\r\nby giving a short history of the circumstances under which the two\r\ngovernment expeditions to which he was attached were organized. He then\r\nconfined his remarks to the subject of the latter expedition, no account\r\nof which has yet been published. Its aim was principally to explore the\r\nregion embraced by what is known as the old Spanish trail from Santa Fe\r\nto California. After giving an interesting account of the topography of\r\nthe region traversed, he proceeded to speak of the traces which were\r\nfound on every hand of a former occupancy by a numerous population now\r\nextinct. These were most numerous near the course of the San Juan river.\r\nThere were found ruins of immense structures, a view of one of which he\r\nexhibited, built regularly of bricks, a foot in thickness, and about\r\neighteen inches in length, with the joints properly broken, and as\r\nregularly laid and as smooth as any in a Fifth Avenue mansion. This\r\nstructure he said was as large as the Croton reservoir. Inside were\r\nrooms nicely plastered as the walls of a modern house. There were also\r\ntraces of extensive canals, which had been constructed to bring water to\r\nthese towns, which were received into large cisterns. The lecturer also\r\nexhibited pieces of pottery which he said abounded everywhere, showing\r\nthat in a former age all this vast region had been inhabited. He gave it\r\nas his opinion that the depopulation of this region was attributable to\r\nthe fact that both to the north and the south were warlike hordes, and\r\nfrom the incursions of one and the other of these, the peaceable Aztecs,\r\nwho had been the former denizens of the country, had been gradually\r\nwiped out. The only people left here now were the Mokies, who lived\r\nin towns inclosed within high, thick walls, and who were almost\r\ninaccessible. These people were visited, and the explorers were received\r\nby them with great hospitality. The speaker concluded by giving a short\r\naccount of the manners of the people and their customs, as far as an\r\nopportunity was had to observe them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRARD'S \"PALIER GLISSANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"_palier glissant_,\" which does not admit of being very happily\r\ntranslated into an English term of equal brevity, is the name given by\r\nthe inventor, Mr. Girard, to a frictionless support, or socket, designed\r\nto sustain the axes of heavy wheels in machinery. Since it is a\r\ncontrivance deriving its efficacy from hydraulic pressure, it may,\r\nwithout impropriety, be considered here. The friction of axles in their\r\nsupports is the occasion of a considerable loss of power in every\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe loss of power itself, though a real disadvantage, is nevertheless a\r\nmatter of secondary consequence compared with the attendant elevation\r\nof temperature, which, were not means carefully provided for reducing\r\nfriction to the lowest point possible, might soon be so great as to\r\narrest the operation of the machine itself. It was stated in a public\r\nlecture delivered in May, 1867, before the Scientific Association of\r\nFrance, that, in a certain instance within the lecturer's knowledge, the\r\nscrew shaft of a French naval propeller became absolutely welded to its\r\nsupport, though surrounded by the water of the sea, in consequence of\r\nthe great heat developed by its revolution.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary means of reducing friction is to apply oil, or some other\r\nunctuous substance, to the parts which move upon each other. Some\r\ndisadvantages attend this expedient, but till a better is suggested\r\nthey have to be endured. The cost of the oil expended in maintaining in\r\nproper condition the axles of the machinery in a foundery, or of the\r\nrolling stock of a railroad, amounts to a large sum annually; while the\r\nwant of neatness which its use makes, to a certain extent, inevitable,\r\nand the labor which must be constantly employed to prevent this want of\r\nneatness from becoming much greater than it is, are serious items to be\r\nset off against its positive usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe object of Mr. Girard is to get rid of all these drawbacks by the\r\nsimple expedient of substituting water for oil. It would not avail to\r\napply water precisely as oil is applied. Though any one's experience may\r\ntell him that two smooth pieces of metal will slide more smoothly on\r\neach other when they are wet than when they are dry, yet every one knows\r\nalso that oil facilitates the movement much more perceptibly than water;\r\nand also, that in the case of oil there is no difficulty in maintaining\r\nthe lubricating film, whereas water easily evaporates, and in case of\r\nthe accident of even a moderate elevation of temperature, it would be\r\nexpelled from the joint entirely. Mr. Girard proposes, therefore, to\r\nemploy the water to act, first, by its pressure, to lift the Journal to\r\nbe lubricated; and secondly, by its fluidity, to form a liquid bed or\r\ncushion between the journal and its box, on which the journal may rest\r\nin its revolution, without touching the metal of the box at all.\r\n\r\nThe construction will be understood by referring to the figure. One of\r\nthe journals is represented as removed, and in the cylindrical surface\r\nof the socket are seen grooves occupying a considerable part of the area\r\nexposed. These grooves communicate, by an aperture in the middle, with\r\na tube which is represented externally, and which sends a branch to the\r\nother journal, through which water under a heavy pressure is introduced\r\ninto the box beneath the journal. The effect of the hydraulic pressure\r\nis to lift the axle, opening a passage for the escape of the compressed\r\nwater, which at the same time, because of its release from compression,\r\nloses the power to sustain the weight. If, therefore, by the first\r\nimpulse, the axle is thrown upward to any sensible distance, it will\r\nimmediately fall back again, once more confining more or less completely\r\nthe water. After one or two oscillations, therefore, the axle will\r\nsettle itself at length in a position in which, while the water will\r\nescape, it will escape but as a film of inappreciable thickness. In this\r\ncondition the journal turns upon a liquid bed, and the resistance to its\r\nrevolution is so excessively small that a slow rotation given by hand\r\nto a wheel sustained by it will be maintained for many minutes without\r\nperceptible retardation. In fact, the most striking illustration which\r\ncan be given of the immense superiority of the _palier glissant_ over\r\na support lubricated in in any other way, is furnished by placing two\r\nprecisely similar wheels or disks side by side, weighing five or six\r\npounds each, with a diameter of seven or eight inches, and journals\r\nof half an inch in diameter; one of them furnished with _paliers\r\nglissants_, and the other with boxes lubricated with fine oil. Give each\r\nof them a velocity of rotation of about one revolution in a second; the\r\none lubricated with oil will come to rest before the other begins to\r\ngive evidence of any sensible retardation; but if at any moment the\r\nstop-cock which supplies the water to the second be turned, this one\r\nwill also stop, and its stopping will be instantaneous.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that a journal supported in the manner above\r\ndescribed would be unsteady and liable to injurious vibrations. This is\r\nnot the case, and it is easy to see why not. When the journal is truly\r\nin the middle of the socket, that is to say when there is an equal\r\ndistance between it and the wall of the socket on either side, it will\r\nbe equally pressed from both sides. But if it is in the least displaced\r\nlaterally, the pressure on the side toward which it moves will instantly\r\nincrease, while that on the other side will correspondingly diminish:\r\nboth causes transpiring to resist the displacement, and to maintain the\r\njournal in the position of true equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe water pressure by which these \"slippery supports\" are supplied must\r\nbe created by a force pump worked by the machine itself. The reservoir\r\nneed not be large as the expenditure of water is very minute in volume.\r\nTo the objection which may naturally be made, that the working of the\r\npump must be a tax on the motive power without return, a reply at once\r\nsimple and satisfactory is found in the experience of Mr. Girard, that\r\nthe working of the pump does not consume so much as half, and sometimes\r\nnot more than one one quarter, of the power which is lost in friction\r\nwhen the ordinary modes of lubrication are employed; so that by the\r\nadoption of this expedient the available power of the machine is\r\nvery sensibly increased after deducting all that is expended in the\r\nperformance of this additional work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEES BENEFICIAL TO FRUIT.--Dr. A. Packard, editor of the _American\r\nNaturalist_, replies to a query in regard to the effects produced upon\r\nfruit by the agency of honey bees, that all the evidence given by\r\nbotanists and zoologists who have specially studied the subject, shows\r\nthat bees improve the quality and tend to increase the quantity of\r\nfruit. They aid in the fertilization of flowers, thus preventing the\r\noccurrence of sterile flowers, and, by more thoroughly fertilizing\r\nflowers already perfect, render the production of sound and well\r\ndeveloped fruit more sure. Many botanists think if it were not for bees,\r\nand other insects, many plants would not bear fruit at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteamboats on the American plan are to be introduced on Lake Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland.

As yet, ships of heavy draft\r\nare unable to get through it. Some disasters to shipping have occurred\r\nin the Red Sea after the canal has been passed, and it is not at\r\nall improbable that more troubles will arise before everything goes\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea is comparatively unknown to navigators. It contains hidden\r\nrocks which must be charted and buoyed before its navigation can be\r\nrendered safe. Surely this ought not to take the world by surprise.\r\nAs to the canal itself, we are only surprised that it has reached its\r\npresent state of perfection and we advise those who now make haste to\r\nprophesy ignominious defeat for one of the greatest enterprises of the\r\ncentury, to suspend judgment for a time. New York journalists might\r\ncertainly call to mind with profit, the annual troubles attending the\r\nopening of the canals in this State. Frosts heave and rats undermine,\r\nand banks annually give way, yet these things are not regarded as\r\nsurprising. But upon the opening of a work, to which all the minor\r\ncanals in the world are like the rods of the magicians to Aaron's rod\r\nwhich swallowed them up, it is expected that everything shall move\r\nwithout difficulty, and that no oversight will have been committed.\r\nTruly this would be to attribute a power of prevision to M. Lesseps\r\nbeyond what is human. The world can afford to wait a little till this\r\nhuge machine gets oiled. Great enterprises move slow at the outset. We\r\nhave yet unshaken faith in the ultimate success of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBULAR BOILERS AND BOILER EXPLOSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our description of the novel steam boiler, published on page 209,\r\nlast volume, we made a quotation from several eminent writers and\r\nexperimenters on the subjects of heat and steam, to the effect that\r\nthe tubular system in steam boilers was wrong in theory and unsafe in\r\npractice, and although this system has hitherto been extensively used on\r\naccount of some advantages which it secures, it has long been a serious\r\nquestion with thinking men whether these advantages were not obtained at\r\ntoo dear a rate.\r\n\r\nWhile not prepared to admit all the force of the objections made to the\r\ntubular system, there are arguments against it that it will not do to\r\ntreat lightly and which seem to us more and more forcible the more we\r\ncandidly reflect upon the subject. One of the most forcible of these\r\nwhich occurs to us is, that in the tubular system the disruptive force\r\nof unequal expansion is far more likely to become a cause of danger than\r\nin the plain cylinder boiler. In such boilers the tension of expanded\r\ntubes is transmitted to the shell, which are greatly strained without\r\ndoubt, often nearly to the verge of rupture. When this occurs it is\r\nevident an unusual strain, caused by sudden generation of steam, would\r\nact in concert with the expansion of the tubes, and we have no doubt\r\nthese causes combined have given rise to many an explosion when the\r\nsteam, acting singly, could never have produced rupture.\r\n\r\nBut while we give due weight to this argument, there is one often\r\nreferred to by our correspondents, and which we often see stated in\r\nnewspapers, as ridiculous as the one we have noticed is forcible. It\r\nis that when, in such boilers, water, by carelessness or otherwise, is\r\nallowed to fall below any of the tubes, the steam which surrounds them\r\nis decomposed, and becomes an explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen\r\ngases, ready to explode with terrible violence whenever the temperature\r\nof the tubes shall have reached the proper point.\r\n\r\nThis argument is ridiculous, because it rests on no experimental basis.\r\nIt is a flimsy theory, entirely unsupported by any facts. Never has it\r\nbeen proved that hot iron, at any temperature likely to be obtained in\r\nsteam boiler tubes, decomposes steam except by itself appropriating\r\nthe oxygen of the steam, and leaving the hydrogen, by itself no more\r\nexplosive than any other heated gas.\r\n\r\nThe sole object of the tubular boiler is to increase the heating\r\nsurface, without corresponding increase in other particulars. That it is\r\nnot the only means whereby this object can be secured has already been\r\ndemonstrated and we believe will hereafter be shown in divers ways. We\r\nhave no more doubt that the next fifty years will witness the total\r\nabandonment of the tubular system, than we have that the world will last\r\nthat length of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN RAILWAY MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems a growing opinion among railway managers that the sole\r\nend and purpose of a railroad is to line the 6 pockets of, if not its\r\nstockholders, at least its directors. In fact we not long since saw a\r\nstatement in a widely-circulated journal, that, as the sole purpose of\r\nrailroads is that the companies who own them should make money, it\r\nis absurd to suppose they would be content to manage them in any way\r\nwhereby such a result would not be most likely to accrue.\r\n\r\nThe journal referred to, in making this statement a basis for an\r\nargument in favor of railway consolidation, entirely ignored the rights\r\nof the public from which railway corporations have obtained their\r\ncharters. In these charters certain privileges were granted, not out of\r\npure generosity, but with the understanding that certain benefits\r\nwere to accrue to the public. Its safety and convenience were to be\r\nconsidered as well as the profits to the owners.\r\n\r\nEvery charter granted to these roads involves a contract on their part\r\nto do the public a certain service, and in a large majority of cases\r\nthese contracts are to-day unfulfilled. Day after day sees the power to\r\ncontrol more and more centered in a few unscrupulous wily managers, and\r\nthe comfort and safety of passengers more and more disregarded; yet\r\nstill the people submit.\r\n\r\nBut they do not submit without complaint. Now and then a newspaper\r\ncorrespondent grumbles, and the news of smashes that may be almost daily\r\nseen in the papers gives a text for an occasional editorial blast, as\r\nlittle heeded by the delinquent companies, as a zephyr is felt by an\r\noak.\r\n\r\nThus the New York _Times_, on the occasion of a recent railway disaster,\r\ngives vent to a little mild denunciation. It says:\r\n\r\n\"The general rule in this country (to which there are indeed exceptions)\r\nin regard to the purchase of railway materials is simply this: buy the\r\ncheapest. First cost is the controlling and often the only question\r\nentertained. The nature of the materials and processes to be used in the\r\nmanufacture of rails, for instance, are not mentioned. The buyers for\r\nsome of our roads, especially new roads, never make the slightest\r\nallusion to quality, and never specify tests and inspections, but\r\nsimply go about among the mills, comparing and beating down prices, and\r\naccepting the very lowest. More than one of our rail makers are to-day\r\nrolling, under protest, rails upon which they decline to put their\r\ntrade-mark--rails made from the very cheapest materials, in the very\r\nmeanest manner--for all that is required is that they shall stick\r\ntogether till they are laid. And if American makers will not roll them,\r\nWelsh makers will. The late report of the State Engineer of New York\r\nsays: 'American railway managers, instead of offering anything like a\r\nreasonable price for good iron rails, have made themselves notorious by\r\nestablishing as standard, a brand of rails known all over the world as\r\n\"American rails,\" which are confessedly bought and sold as the weakest,\r\nmost impure, least worked, least durable, and cheapest rails that can be\r\nproduced.' The State Engineer refers, in confirmation of this opinion,\r\nto the statement of Mr. A.S. Hewitt, United States Commissioner to the\r\nParis Exposition, a statement not yet controverted; and to a statement\r\nof Mr. Sandberg, an English engineer of note, in the London _Times_.\r\nA leading American railway president and reformer has publicly said:\r\n'There is a fear on my part that railway companies will themselves tempt\r\nsteel makers to send a poor article by buying the cheapest--first cost\r\nonly considered--_as they did with the ironmasters_.'\"\r\n\r\nThis certainly is a blessed state of affairs. We have given privileges\r\nto giant corporations, which they have improved so profitably, that they\r\nnow can defeat, in our Legislatures, any attempt to revoke them, and can\r\nlaugh at any demand for better management.\r\n\r\nDisguise it how we may, the railroads have got the upper hand of the\r\npeople, and they seem likely to keep it, unless, indeed, their rapacity\r\nshall react against themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of this writing accounts reach us of the officers of a\r\nprominent railway line intrenching themselves against the officers of\r\nthe law, and employing force to resist the service of precepts calling\r\nthem to account for alleged frauds upon the stockholders.\r\n\r\nThat the Legislature of this State has the power to put a stop to these\r\ndisgraceful proceedings, is certain; what it will do remains to be\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN INSTITUTE PRIZES AWARDED TO STEAM ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is anybody satisfied with the action of the managers of the\r\nAmerican Institute, in the matter of awarding prizes to the competing\r\nengines exhibited at the recent fair, we have yet to meet that\r\ncomplacent individual. Neither the exhibitors nor the general public\r\ncould be expected to accept with equanimity such a report as the\r\nmanagers have made, because it is inadequate to give any real idea of\r\nthe relative merits of the engines tested. The exhibitors, at a large\r\nexpense, took their engines to the hall of exhibition, placed them in\r\nposition, and with them drove the machinery exhibited there; and now,\r\nwhen in return they had a right to expect a decided, manly course on the\r\npart of the managers, the oyster is swallowed and the contestants are\r\neach politely handed a shell.\r\n\r\nThe conditions on which the general test was to be made contained, among\r\nother specifications, these: that \"the water supplied to and evaporated\r\nin the boiler will be measured by means of a meter, and the coal burned\r\nmay also be weighed.\"\r\n\r\nOnly one of the conditions quoted was properly complied with. The coal\r\nwas weighed, but though a meter was used to measure the water, tests\r\nmade, we are informed, _after the trial of the engines_, showed that\r\nthe meter was so inaccurate as to completely invalidate any calculation\r\nbased upon its record of the water supplied. Nevertheless this has,\r\nwe are credibly informed, been made the basis of calculation; and the\r\namount of coal consumed during each trial has been rejected either as a\r\nbasis of calculation or a check on the inaccuracy of the meter.\r\n\r\nOther prescribed regulations were observed with great care. The engines\r\nwere indicated in a masterly manner by a gentleman of great experience,\r\nas the cards--tracings of which we have seen--bear ample testimony. The\r\ntemperature of the feedwater was 47 degrees; it should, in our opinion,\r\nhave been heated, but we waive this point. The state of the barometer\r\nand temperatures of engine room and fire-room were observed; but\r\nwe respectfully submit, that with coal consumption left out of the\r\ncalculation, and the water consumption an unascertained quantity, the\r\nquestion of relative economy, the vital point to be settled, is as\r\nuncertain today as it was before the test.\r\n\r\nIn the _Tribune_ of December 20, appeared a statement of the test to\r\nascertain the accuracy of the meter used, which showed that in an\r\naggregate of twelve tests it varied nearly three per cent in its record\r\nfrom the actual quantity delivered, while at times it was so erratic\r\nthat it varied in one instance over _ten per cent_.\r\n\r\nTruly, considered in connection with this fundamental error,\r\ntemperatures of engine and boiler rooms, and states of barometer, will\r\nnot count for much with engineers.\r\n\r\nAn oversight like this would, however, never have been laid at the door\r\nof the managers, however it might invalidate the test; but when the\r\nutterly absurd decision announced in the papers, after a tedious delay\r\nhad led the public to expect an exhaustive statement, gave rise to\r\ngeneral disappointment and excited the utmost dissatisfaction, it became\r\nmanifest that a manly, straightforward course on their part was not to\r\nbe hoped for, and that any protest against the consummation of the farce\r\nwould be vain.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to decide on the merits of the engines submitted to\r\ntest. It was for the judges to do this. We maintain that nothing that\r\nthe public will accept as a decision has been reached, and on behalf of\r\nthe public we protest that the managers have not only placed themselves\r\nin a very unenviable position by their action in the premises, but have\r\ndone a lasting injury to the American Institute, the results of which\r\nwill be disastrously felt in future exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe studied ambiguity of the report which awards two first prizes to\r\nthe competing engines, is no less apparent than the desire to shun\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROTEST AGAINST THE CANADIAN PATENT LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1869, the New Dominion Patent Law went into operation, but it\r\nhas not yet been approved by the Queen, and if rejected the Canadian\r\nParliament will perhaps try its hand again. Although Canadians may\r\nfreely go to all parts of the world and take out patents for their\r\ninventions, they have always manifested a mean spirit and adopted a\r\nnarrow policy, in reference to inventors of other nations. Their present\r\npatent laws are so framed as practically to debar all persons except\r\nCanadians from taking patents; and the result is that American and\r\nEnglish inventions are pirated and patented in the Dominion, without so\r\nmuch as a \"thank you, sir,\" to the _bona fide_ originators.\r\n\r\nA protest has been presented to her Majesty's Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies, asking that the new law may be rejected, on the ground that it\r\ndeprives the subjects of the Crown of their equal rights throughout\r\nthe empire. There is force in this objection, and Lord Granville has\r\npromised that it shall be duly considered before the Queen is advised to\r\nsign the law.\r\n\r\nThe probable result will be a revision of the Dominion patent code so as\r\nto let in Englishmen but exclude the Yankees, from whom the Canadians\r\nderive whatever of improvement, progress, and energy they possess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRIGHTER SIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngratitude seldom enters into the composition of a true inventor, and\r\nnothing in our business career has afforded us more pleasure than the\r\nfrequent letters addressed to us by those who have, during more than\r\ntwenty years, employed the Scientific American Patent Agency. We cannot\r\nfind room for all the pleasant missives that come to us from our\r\nextensive list of clients, but we may give a few as samples of the many.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel J. Gale, of Sheboygan, Wis., has recently secured through our\r\nAgency Letters Patent for a \"Perpetual and Lunar Calendar Clock.\" In the\r\nfullness of his satisfaction he thus writes: \"The fact is, I shall never\r\nbe able to thank you sufficiently for what you have done for me. I\r\nsent you a copy of the paper printed here, which favorably notices my\r\nimprovement and your great Agency. The fees charged me for my patent\r\nhave been low enough. Already, by one of my own townsmen, I have been\r\noffered $4,000 for my interest in the patent. But I must not take up too\r\nmuch of your I time. Please allow me to add that I regularly receive\r\nyour valuable paper, the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, and that you may number me\r\nas one of its stanch friends.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Norton, of Brooklyn, N.Y., in a recent note, says: \"Allow me\r\nto express my thanks for the promptness and efficiency with which the\r\nbusiness of obtaining a patent for my 'Cinder and Dust Arrester' has\r\nbeen conducted through your Agency--and not only in this case but in\r\nseveral previous ones. This is the _fourth_ patent obtained by me\r\nthrough four Agency within nine months. It gives me pleasure to add my\r\ntestimony to that of many others, with respect to the very satisfactory\r\nmanner in which your Patent Agency is conducted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. E. J. Marstens says, in reference to his improved \"Field Press\"--\"I\r\nfind everything correct. You certainly accomplished more than I expected\r\nafter the first examination by the Primary Examiner. I hope soon to be\r\nable to give you another case.\"\r\n\r\nMr. S. P. Williams, an old client, writes as follows: \"I received the\r\npatent on my 'Trace Lock for Whiffletrees,' and I am truly pleased with\r\nthe prompt manner in which you have done the business. It is only a few\r\nweeks since I made the application, and I expected that it would be as\r\nmany months before the patent could be granted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR FISKE'S LECTURES AT HARVARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt certainly argues well for the intellectual character of the readers\r\nof the New York _World_ that during the prevalent taste for sensational\r\njournalism, it has found the publication of a series of philosophical\r\nlectures acceptable. We thank our neighbor for thus making these\r\nlectures available to the general public. Their ability is\r\nunquestionable; and the calmness and candor which Professor Fiske brings\r\nto the treatment of the subject is such as to add greatly to the force\r\nof his logic.\r\n\r\nThe \"positive philosophy\" has been shown by Professor Fiske to be much\r\nmisunderstood, misapprehension not being confined solely to the ranks of\r\nits opponents.\r\n\r\nHis exposition of some of the misconceptions on which Professor Huxley\r\nhas based some criticisms upon the writings of Comte, strikes us as\r\nespecially forcible; and the whole course of lectures proves Professor\r\nFiske to be one of the clearest and most able of American thinkers.\r\n\r\nThese lectures are followed as they appear, with great interest, and\r\ntheir publication in the World we regard as a real and permanent benefit\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC LECTURES BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe announcement of these lectures came to hand too late for our last\r\nissue, and the first has already been delivered. The course is as\r\nfollows: Friday, Dec. 17, The Battle Fields of Science, by Andrew D.\r\nWhite, President of the Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. Friday, Dec.\r\n24, How Animals Move, by Professor E. S. Morse, of the Peabody Academy\r\nof Science, Salem, Mass. Friday, Dec. 31, The Correlation of Vital and\r\nPhysical Forces, by Professor G. F. Barker, of Yale College, New Haven.\r\nFriday, Jan. 7, The Air and Respiration, by Professor J. C. Draper, of\r\nthe College of the City of New York. Friday, Jan. 14, The Connection\r\nof Natural Science and Mental Philosophy, by Professor J. Bascom, of\r\nWilliams College, Williamstown, Mass. Friday, Jan. 21, The Constitution\r\nof the Sun, by Dr. B. A. Gould, of Cambridge, Mass. Friday, Jan. 28,\r\nThe Colorado Plateau, its Canons and Ruined Cities, by Professor J. S.\r\nNewberry, of Columbia College, New York.\r\n\r\nThe course is a good one, and ought to be, and doubtless will be, well\r\nattended. Abstracts of the lectures will appear as delivered, in the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE FIELDS OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nLECTURE BY PROFESSOR WHITE, BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lecture did not disappoint the expectations of those familiar with\r\nthe subject of the discourse, which, considering the difficulty of\r\nrestating familiar historical facts in such a manner as to clothe them\r\nin a garb of originality, is high praise. Many, however, found great\r\ndifficulty in hearing the speaker at the back part of the hall, and some\r\nleft the room on that account. This was unfortunate, as the lecture will\r\nscarcely be exceeded in interest by any subsequent one of the course.\r\nThe speaker said that \"In all modern history, interference with science\r\nin the supposed interest of religion--no matter how conscientious such\r\ninterference may have been--has resulted in the direst evils both to\r\nreligion and science, and _invariably_. And on the other hand all\r\nuntrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to\r\nreligion some of its stages may have seemed, temporarily, to be, has\r\ninvariably resulted in the highest good of religion and science. I say\r\n_invariably_--I mean exactly that. It is a rule to which history shows\r\nnot one exception. It would seem, logically, that this statement could\r\nnot be gainsaid. God's truth must agree, whether discovered by looking\r\nwithin upon the soul or without upon the world. A truth written upon the\r\nhuman heart to-day in its full play of emotions or passions, cannot be\r\nat any real variance even with a truth written upon a fossil whose poor\r\nlife was gone millions of years ago. And this being so, it would also\r\nseem a truth irrefragable; that the search for each of these kind of\r\ntruths must be followed out in its own lines, by its own methods, to its\r\nown results, without any interference from investigators along other\r\nlines by other methods. And it would also seem logically that we might\r\nwork on in absolute confidence that whatever, at any moment, might seem\r\nto be the relative positions of the two different bands of workers, they\r\nmust at last come together, for truth is one. But logic is not history.\r\nHistory is full of interferences which have cost the earth dear.\r\nStrangest of all, some of the most direful of them have been made by\r\nthe best of men, actuated by the purest motives, seeking the noblest\r\nresults. These interferences and the struggle against them make up the\r\nwarfare of science. One statement more to clear the ground. You will not\r\nunderstand me at all to say that religion has done nothing for science.\r\nIt has done much for it. The work of Christianity has been mighty\r\nindeed. Through these 2,000 years it has undermined servitude, mitigated\r\ntyranny, given hope to the hopeless, comfort to the afflicted, light to\r\nthe blind, bread to the starving, life to the dying, and all this\r\nwork continues. And its work for science, too, has been great. It has\r\nfostered science often and developed it. It has given great minds to it,\r\nand but for the fears of the timid its record in this respect would have\r\nbeen as great as in the other. Unfortunately, religious men started\r\ncenturies ago with the idea that purely scientific investigation is\r\nunsafe--that theology must intervene. So began this great modern war.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor White next reviewed the battle between science and theology\r\non the subjects of the \"earth's shape, surface, and relations,\" \"the\r\nposition of the earth among the heavenly bodies,\" in which Copernicus\r\nand Galileo struggled so bravely and successfully for truth.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer said:\r\n\r\n\"The principal weapons in the combat are worth examining. They are very\r\neasily examined; you may pick them up on any of the battle-fields of\r\nscience; but on that field they were used with more effect than on\r\nalmost any other. These weapons were two epithets--the epithets\r\n'Infidel' and 'Atheist.' These can hardly be classed with civilized\r\nweapons; they are burning arrows; they set fire to great masses of\r\npopular prejudices. Smoke rises to obscure the real questions. Fire\r\nbursts out at times to destroy the attacked party. They are poisoned\r\nweapons. They go to the heart of loving women; they alienate dear\r\nchildren; they injure the man after life is ended, for they leave\r\npoisoned wounds in the hearts of those who loved him best--fears for his\r\neternal happiness, dread of the Divine displeasure. The battle-fields\r\nof science are thickly strewn with these. They have been used against\r\nalmost every man who has ever done anything for his fellow-men. The list\r\nof those who have been denounced as Infidel and Atheist includes almost\r\nall great men of science--general scholars, inventors, philanthropists.\r\nThe deepest Christian life, the most noble Christian character has not\r\navailed to shield combatants. Christians like Isaac Newton and Pascal,\r\nand John Locke and John Howard, have had these weapons hurled against\r\nthem. Nay, in these very times we have seen a noted champion hurl these\r\nweapons against John Milton, and with it another missile which often\r\nappears on these battle-fields--the epithets of 'blasphemer' and 'hater\r\nof the Lord.' Of course, in these days these weapons though often\r\neffective in disturbing the ease of good men and though often powerful\r\nin scaring women, are somewhat blunted. Indeed, they do not infrequently\r\ninjure assailants more than assailed. So it was not in the days of\r\nGalileo. These weapons were then in all their sharpness and venom.\r\nThe first champion who appears against him is Bellarmine, one of the\r\ngreatest of theologians and one of the poorest of scientists. He was\r\nearnest, sincere, learned, but made the fearful mistake for the world\r\nof applying direct literal interpretation of Scripture to science. The\r\nconsequences were sad, indeed. Could he with his vast powers have taken\r\na different course, humanity would have been spared the long and fearful\r\nwar which ensued, and religion would have saved to herself thousands\r\non thousands of the best and brightest men in after ages. The weapons,\r\nwhich men of Bellarmine's stamp used, were theological. They held\r\nup before the world the dreadful consequences which must result to\r\nChristian theology were the doctrine to prevail that the heavenly bodies\r\nrevolve about the sun, and not about the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The next great series of battles were fought on those great fields\r\noccupied by such sciences as _Chemistry and Natural Philosophy_. Even\r\nbefore these sciences were out of their childhood--while yet they were\r\ntottering mainly towards, childish objects and by childish steps--the\r\nchampions of that same old mistaken conception of rigid Scriptural\r\ninterpretation began the war. The catalogue of chemists and physicists\r\npersecuted or thwarted would fill volumes.\"\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to many other battle-fields of science which might not\r\nfor want of time be dwelt upon at length the lecturer reviewed the\r\nbattle grounds of medicine and anatomy on which some of the severest\r\nwarfare has been waged.\r\n\r\nThe speaker here remarked that \"perhaps the most unfortunate thing that\r\nhas ever been done for Christianity is the tying it to forms of science\r\nand systems of education, which are doomed and gradually sinking. Just\r\nas in the time of Roger Bacon excellent but mistaken men devoted all\r\ntheir energies to binding Christianity to Aristotle. Just as in the time\r\nof Reuchlin and Erasmus they insisted on binding Christianity to Thomas\r\nAquinas, so in the time of Vesalius such men gave all efforts to linking\r\nChristianity to Galen. The cry has been the same in all ages. It is the\r\nsame which we hear in this age against scientific studies--the cry\r\nfor what is called '_sound learning_.' Whether standing for Aristotle\r\nagainst Bacon, or Aquinas against Erasmus, or Galen against Vesalius,\r\nor making mechanical Greek verses at Eton, instead of studying the\r\nhandiwork of the Almighty, or reading Euripides with translations\r\ninstead of Leasing and Goethe in the original, the cry always is for\r\n'sound learning.' The idea always is that these studies are _safe_.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker next proceeded to show that not alone in Catholic countries,\r\nhas such warfare been waged, and that even now in Protestant America the\r\nfight is going on.\r\n\r\nOne of the fields on which the severest warfare had raged in Protestant\r\ncountries was that of Geology. \"From the first lispings of investigators\r\nin this science there was war. The early sound doctrine was that fossil\r\nremains were _lusus naturae_--freaks of nature--and in 1517 Fracastor\r\nwas violently attacked because he thought them something more. No less a\r\nman than Bernard Palissy followed up the contest, on the right side, in\r\nFrance, but it required 150 years to carry the day fairly against this\r\nsingle preposterous theory. The champion who dealt it the deadly blow\r\nwas Scilla, and his weapons were facts obtained by examination of\r\nthe fossils of Calabria, (1670). But the advocates of tampering with\r\nscientific reasoning soon retired to a now position. It was strong, for\r\nit was apparently based upon Scripture--though, as the whole world now\r\nknows, an utterly exploded interpretation of Scripture. The new position\r\nwas that the fossils were produced by the deluge of Noah. In vain had\r\nit been shown by such devoted Christians as Bernard Palissy that this\r\ntheory was utterly untenable; in vain did good men protest against the\r\ninjury sure to result to religion by tying it to a scientific theory\r\nsure to be exploded--the doctrine that the fossils were remains of\r\nanimals drowned at the flood continued to be upheld by the great\r\nmajority as '_sound_' doctrine. It took 120 year for the searchers\r\nof God's truth, as revealed in nature--such men as Buffon, Linnaeus,\r\nWoodward, and Whitehurst--to run under these mighty fabrics of error,\r\nand by statements which could not be resisted, to explode them.\r\n\r\n\"Strange as it may at first seem, the war on geology was waged more\r\nfiercely in Protestant countries than Catholic, and of all countries\r\nEngland furnished the most bitter opponents. You have noted already that\r\nthere are generally two sorts of attacks on a new science. First,\r\nthere is the attack by pitting against science some great doctrine in\r\ntheology. You saw this in astronomy, when Bellarmine and others insisted\r\nthat the doctrine of the earth's revolving about the sun is contrary to\r\nthe doctrine of the Incarnation. So now against geology it was urged\r\nthat the scientific doctrine that the fossils represented animals which\r\ndied before Adam was contrary to the doctrine of Adam's fall, and that\r\ndeath entered the world by sin. Then there is the attack by the literal\r\ninterpretation of texts, which serves a better purpose generally in\r\narousing prejudice. It is difficult to realize it now, but within the\r\nmemory of the majority of those before me, the battle was raging most\r\nfiercely in England, and both these kinds of artillery were in full play\r\nand filling the civilized world with their roar. Less than thirty years\r\nago, the Rev. J. Mellor Brown was hurling at all geologists alike, and\r\nespecially at such Christian divines as Dr. Burkland, Dean Conybeare,\r\nand Pye Smith, and such religious scholars as Professor Sedgwick, the\r\nepithets of 'Infidel,' 'Impugner of the Sacred Record,' and 'Assailant\r\nof the Volume of God.' His favorite weapon was the charge that these\r\nmen were 'attacking the Truth of God,' forgetting that they were simply\r\nopposing the mistaken interpretations of J. Mellor Brown. He declared\r\ngeology 'not a subject of lawful inquiry;' he speaks of it as 'a dark\r\nart,' as 'dangerous and disreputable,' as a 'forbidden province.' This\r\nattempt to scare men from science having failed, various other means\r\nwere taken.\r\n\r\n\"To say nothing about England, it is humiliating to human nature to\r\nremember the trials to which the pettiest and narrowest of men subjected\r\nsuch Christian scholars in our country as Benjamin Silliman and Edward\r\nHitchcock. But it is a duty and a pleasure to state here that one great\r\nChristian scholar did honor to religion and to himself by standing\r\nup for the claims of science despite all these clamors. That man was\r\nNicholas Wiseman, better known afterward as Cardinal Wiseman. The\r\nconduct of this pillar of the Roman Catholic Church contrasts nobly with\r\nthat of timid Protestants who were filling England with shrieks and\r\ndenunciations. Perhaps the most singular attempt against geology was\r\nthat made by a fine specimen of the English Don, Dean Cockburn of York,\r\nto _abuse_ its champions out of the field. Without apparently the\r\nsimplest elementary knowledge of geology, he opened a battery of abuse.\r\nHe gives it to the world at large by pulpit and press; he even inflicts\r\nit upon leading statesmen by private letters. But these weapons did not\r\nsucceed. They were like Chinese gongs and dragon lanterns against rifled\r\ncannon. Buckland, Pye Smith, Lyell, Silliman, Hitchcock, Murchison,\r\nAgassiz, Dana, and a host of of noble champions besides, pressed on the\r\nbattle for truth was won. And was it won merely for men of science?\r\nThe whole civilized world declares that it was won for religion; that\r\nthereby has infinitely increased the knowledge of the power and goodness\r\nof God.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecturer classed the present opposition of the Catholics to the Free\r\nSchool system in this country among the long list of battles between\r\nscience and theology and concluded his lecture as follows:\r\n\r\n\"But, my friends, I will not weary you with so recent a chapter in the\r\nhistory of the great warfare extending through the centuries. There\r\nare cheering omens. The greatest and best men in the churches--the men\r\nstanding at centers of thought--are insisting with power, more and more,\r\nthat religion shall no longer be tied to so injurious a policy--that\r\nsearchers for truth, whether in Theology or Natural Science, shall work\r\non as friends, sure that, no matter how much at variance they may at\r\ntimes seem to be, the truths they reach shall finally be fused into each\r\nother. No one need fear the result. No matter whether science shall\r\ncomplete her demonstration that man has been on the earth six thousand\r\nyears or six hundred thousand. No matter whether she reveal new ideas of\r\nthe Creator or startling relations between his creatures--the result,\r\nwhen fully thought out, will serve and strengthen religion not less than\r\nscience. The very finger of the Almighty has written on history that\r\nscience must be studied by means proper to itself, and in no other way.\r\nThat history is before us all. No one can gainsay it. It is decisive,\r\nfor it is this: There has never been a scientific theory framed for the\r\nuse of Scriptural texts, which has been made to stand. This fact alone\r\nshows that our wonderful volume of sacred literature was not given for\r\nany such purpose as that to which so many earnest men have endeavored\r\nto wrest it. The power of that volume has been mighty indeed. It has\r\ninspired the best deeds our world has known. Despite the crusts which\r\nmen have formed about it--despite the fetters which they have placed\r\nupon it--Christianity has blessed age after age of the past, and will go\r\non as a blessing through age after age of the future. Let the Warfare\r\nof Science, then, be changed. Let it be a warfare in which religion\r\nand science shall stand together as allies, not against each other as\r\nenemies. Let the fight be for truth of every kind against falsehood of\r\nevery kind--for justice against injustice--for right against wrong--for\r\nbeauty against deformity--for goodness against vice--and the great\r\nwarfare which has brought so many sufferings, shall bring to the earth\r\nGod's richest blessings.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FRENCH BANK NOTES ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a new batch of French notes is to be printed, an equivalent number\r\nof the choicely prepared and preserved sheets of paper is handed over\r\nto the superintendent of the printing office. This office is among the\r\ninner buildings of the Bank of France, and is governed by very rigorous\r\nrules in all things. The operatives are all picked men, skillful,\r\nactive, and silent. The sheets, the ink, and the matrixes of the plates\r\nare kept securely under lock and key until actually wanted. The\r\nprinting is effected by steam-worked presses. The ink is blue, and its\r\ncomposition known only to a few of the authorities. An inspector goes\r\nhis rounds during the continuance of the operations, watching every\r\npress, every workman, every process. A beautiful machine, distinct from\r\nthe press, is employed to print the variable numbers on the note; fed\r\nwith sheets of paper, it will number a thousand of them in succession,\r\nchanging the digits each time, and scarcely requiring to be touched\r\nmeanwhile; even the removal of one note and the placing of another are\r\neffected by automatic agency. At every successive stage the note is\r\nexamined. So complete is the registration of everything that a record is\r\nalways at hand of the number of sheets rejected ever since the Bank of\r\nFrance was established, be its defects in the paper, the printing, or\r\nthe numbering. When the master-printer has delivered up his packets of\r\nprinted and numbered sheets, each note is stamped with the signature of\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Comptroller. This completes the _creation_\r\nof notes. The notes so created are kept in a strong box, of which the\r\nSecretary-General and the Comptroller have keys, and are retained until\r\nthe day of _issue_. The chief cashier tells the Governor that he wants a\r\nnew supply of a particular denomination of notes, the Governor tells the\r\ncouncil, the council tell the secretary-general and the comptroller, and\r\nthese two functionaries open their strong box, and hand over the notes\r\ndemanded. The notes at this time are not really money; they do not\r\nbecome so until the chief cashier has put his signature to each, and\r\nregistered its number in a book.\r\n\r\nThe life of a French bank note is said to average two or three\r\nyears, and does not terminate until the condition is very shaky\r\nindeed--crimpled, pierced with pinholes, corner creases torn, soft,\r\ntarnished, decrepit while yet young. Some have been half-burned; one has\r\nbeen found half-digested in the stomach of a goat, and one boiled in a\r\nwaistcoat-pocket by a laundress. No matter; the cashier at the bank will\r\ndo his best to decipher it; he will indeed take an infinity of trouble\r\nto put together the ashes of a burned note, and will give the owner a\r\nnew note or the value in coin, if satisfied of the integrity of the\r\nold one. The bank authorities preserve specimens of this kind as\r\ncuriosities, minute fragments gummed in their proper position on a sheet\r\nof paper. Very few of the notes are actually and irrevocably lost.\r\nDuring the last sixty-seven years 24,000 bank notes of 1,000 francs each\r\nhave been issued, and of this number 23,958 had been returned to the\r\nbank by the month of January 1869, leaving only 42 unaccounted for.\r\nWhether these 42 are still in existence, or have seen burned into\r\nuncollected ashes, or are at the bottom of the sea, or elsewhere, is not\r\nknown. Of 500-franc notes, 24,935 have been returned out of 25,000. The\r\nbank holds itself morally and financially responsible for the small\r\nnumber of notes unreturned, ready to cash them if at any time presented.\r\n\r\nThe bank sends the old notes again and again into circulation, if\r\nverified and usable; but they are examined first, and any that are found\r\ntoo defective are canceled by stamping a hole in them. These canceled\r\nnotes pass from one official to another, and are grouped in classified\r\nbundles; the book that records the birth of each note now receives a\r\nnotification of its civil death, and after three years incarceration in\r\na great oak chest, a grand conflagration takes place. A huge fire is\r\nkindled in an open court; the defunct notes are thrown into a sort of\r\nrevolving wire-cage over the fire; the cage is kept rotating; and the\r\nminute fragments of ash, whirled out of the cage through the meshes,\r\ntake their flight into infinite space--no one knows whither. The Bank of\r\nFrance prints a certain number of notes per day, and destroys a smaller\r\nnumber, so as to have always in reserve a sufficient supply of new notes\r\nto meet any emergency; but the actual burning, the grand flare-up takes\r\nplace only about once a month, when perhaps 150,000 will be burned\r\nat once. The French go down to lower denominations than the Rank of\r\nEngland, having notes of 100 francs and 50 francs, equivalent to £4 and\r\n£2. There must be a great deal of printing always going on in the Bank\r\nof France, seeing that in 1868 they issued 2,711 000 notes, of an\r\naggregate value of 904,750,000 francs (averaging about £13 each), and\r\nburned 1,927,192, value 768,854,900 francs.\r\n\r\nIt _sounds_ a very dreadful thing for 30,000,000 sterling in bank notes\r\nto be willfully burned in one year. But there is always a phoenix to\r\nrise from its ashes; the bank can regenerate as fast as it kills. The\r\nBank of France, in 1846, put in circulation a beautiful crimson printed\r\nnote for 5,000 francs; but the French people did not like notes of so\r\nhigh a denomination, and all but a very few of this kind have been\r\nreturned and canceled. On one occasion, a superb individual, wishing to\r\npay a dowry in handsome style, obtained twelve notes of 5,000 francs\r\neach for the purpose; but they were returned the very next day by the\r\nbanker, who much preferred smaller notes for his general purposes. The\r\nnotes now regularly kept in circulation in France are those of 1,000,\r\n500, 100, and 50 francs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE NEWSPAPERS SAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VALUABLE PAPER.--Of all the journals published in the United States,\r\nfor the mechanic and scientific man, there is nothing that will in any\r\nway compare with the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, published by Munn & Co., of 37\r\nPark Row, New York.

Paul Champion, who has lately visited\r\nthat country, and published a very interesting book on the ancient and\r\nmodern industries of that curious people. A very common method is to\r\nplace the eggs in a mixture of clay and water; the clay hardens around\r\nthe eggs, and is said to preserve them good for a considerable time. But\r\nanother and much more elaborate method is also commonly practiced. An\r\ninfusion of three pounds of tea is made in boiling water, and to this\r\nare added three pounds of quicklime (or seven pounds when the operation\r\nis performed in winter), nine pounds of sea-salt, and seven pounds of\r\nashes of burnt oak finely powdered. This is all well mixed together\r\ninto a smooth paste by means of a wooden spatula, and then each egg is\r\ncovered with it by hand, gloves being worn to prevent the corrosive\r\naction of the lime on the hands. When the eggs are all covered with the\r\nmixture, they are rolled in a mass of straw ashes, and then placed in\r\nbaskets with balls of rice--boiled, we presume--to keep the eggs from\r\ntouching each other. About 100 to 150 eggs are placed in one basket. In\r\nabout three months the whole becomes hardened into a crust, and then the\r\neggs are sent to market; the retail price of such eggs is generally less\r\nthan a penny each. These eggs are highly esteemed in China, and always\r\nserved in good houses; but they have undergone a strange transformation,\r\nwhich certainly would not recommend them to English palates; the yolk\r\nhas assumed a decidedly green tinge, and the white is set. When broken,\r\nthey emit that unpleasant sulphurous smell which would certainly cause\r\ntheir instant banishment from our breakfast-tables. However, the Chinese\r\nare admitted, even by Frenchmen, to be great _gourmets_; and we can\r\nonly say, therefore, that in questions of eating there is certainly no\r\ndisputing about tastes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM BOILER INSPECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Guthrie, U.S. Inspector, informs us that the following\r\nresolution was recently adopted by the Board of Supervising Inspectors:\r\n\r\nResolved, That a special committee be appointed, to whom shall be\r\nreferred the subject-matter of steam boiler explosions, who shall be\r\nrequested to take up the subject in all its varied complications, and\r\npresent the result of their inquiries, with their opinions of the real\r\ncauses of such explosions, accompanied by such information as may be\r\nof practical benefit and general interest, to be reported at the next\r\nannual meeting of the board for its consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie, whose address will be at Washington, D.C. until January 10,\r\ndesires to receive suggestions from practical engineers upon the subject\r\nof boiler explosions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarkness of complexion has been attributed to the sun's power from\r\nthe age of Solomon to this day. \"Look not upon me because I am black,\r\nbecause the sun hath looked upon me.\" And there cannot be a doubt that,\r\nto a certain degree, the opinion is well founded--the invisible rays in\r\nthe solar beams, which change vegetable color, and have been employed\r\nwith such remarkable effect on the daguerreotype, act upon every\r\nsubstance on which they fall, producing mysterious and wonderful changes\r\nin their molecular state, man not excepted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three companies under whose protection Chinese are brought into\r\nCalifornia, keep an accurate account of the condition and employment\r\nof the persons they import.

Of these, 10,426 have died,\r\n57,323 have returned to China, and about 91,000 still remain on the\r\nPacific coast. But only 41,000 live in California. Of these 41,000,\r\n9,300 are women, children, old and decrepit, or criminals confined in\r\nthe jails.

It is one of the most simple and effective\r\nguns we have yet seen. Only three motions are required to load,\r\ndischarge the piece, and throw out the shell of the cartridge. The\r\nbreech-block is side-hinged, and it is opened and the shell is thrown\r\nout by simply bringing the gun to half cock. The gun may, however, be\r\ncocked without opening the breech by pressing the trigger while cocking.\r\n\r\nThe gun, when held in position, may be fired at the rate of forty shots\r\nper minute. All the movements of the parts are directly backward and\r\nforward; in our opinion the best that can be employed for this purpose,\r\nand the least liable to get out of order. In short, the gun possesses\r\nall the essentials of a first class rifle, and has advantages which we\r\nthink are not ordinarily met with in arms of this character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOVEL FRENCH HAND VISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn using ordinary hand vises several inconveniences are met with. For\r\ninstance, if it is desired to work a piece of metal of a certain length,\r\nit must necessarily be presented obliquely on the side of the jaw of the\r\nvise, because of its screw, which is horizontal and forms a knob in the\r\naxis of the vise. The consequences are, first, that on tightening the\r\nnut of the horizontal screw vise the pressure is only exerted on the\r\nside, and greatly tries the vise itself while obtaining an irregular\r\npressure; secondly, that as the piece to be worked is held obliquely,\r\nhowever skilled the workman may be, he always finds himself cramped in\r\nthe execution of his work, particularly if of a delicate nature.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these inconveniences a Parisian mechanic has designed and\r\nlately patented in England the neat form of hand vise of which we annex\r\nillustrations, Fig. 1 being an elevation and Fig. 2 a longitudinal\r\nsection. In these views, A, is a wooden or metal handle pierced\r\nthroughout its length; this handle of metal may be made in one piece,\r\nwith the nut, and the conical ferrule. B is the ring or ferrule of the\r\nhandle; and C are the jaws of the vise worked by the adjusting screw,\r\nD, and the springs, r r. E is a conical ferrule or shoulder, fixed or\r\nmovable, and serving to open or close the jaws of the vise accordingly\r\nas the handle is turned right or left; this conical shoulder is\r\nprotected from wear by a tempered steel washer, v. G is a nut with\r\ncollar carrying the conical ferrule or shoulder, E, and the steel\r\nwasher, v, while H H are the joints of the jaws of the vise held by a\r\nscrew, I, which serves as a support to the adjusting screw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis hand vise may be applied to a number of uses, and among others it\r\nmay be readily converted into a haft or handle for any kind of tailed\r\nor shanked tool, such as files, wrenches, olive bits, chisels, or\r\nscrewdrivers, and may also serve as pincers or nippers. It is of very\r\nsimple construction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND-BUILDERS IN COLORADO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew evidence of the existence of the Mound-Builders in the mountain\r\nranges of Colorado, similar to those in Montana, Utah, and Nevada, have\r\nrecently been discovered by Mr. C.A. Deane, of Denver. He found upon\r\nthe extreme summit of the snow-range structures of stone, evidently of\r\nancient origin, and hitherto unknown or unmolested. Opposite to and\r\nalmost north of the South Boulder Creek, and the summit of the range,\r\nDr. Deane observed large numbers of granite rocks, and many of them as\r\nlarge as two men could lift, in a position that could not have been\r\nthe result of chance. They had evidently been placed upright in a line\r\nconforming to a general contour of the dividing ridge, and frequently\r\nextending in an unbroken line for one or two hundred yards. The walls\r\nand the mounds are situated three thousand feet above the timber line.\r\nIt is, therefore, hardly supposable that they were built for altars of\r\nsacrifice. They were not large enough for shelter or defense. The more\r\nprobable supposition is that, like the large mounds in Montana and\r\nelsewhere, they were places of sepulture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOVEN-WIRE MATTRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our readers who attended the last Fair of the American\r\nInstitute, will recall an article in the furniture department, which\r\nattracted much attention on account of its novelty and utility. We refer\r\nto the wire mattress, or bed, manufactured by the Woven Wire Mattress\r\nCompany, of Hartford, Conn. To the ordinary mind a new invention is\r\ninteresting or not, in proportion to the probability of its coming into\r\nevery-day use, and many a good housewife lingers in admiration over an\r\nimproved sewing machine or cooking stove, to whom a new steam engine has\r\nno attraction. For this reason it was that the wire mattress was sat on\r\nand lain on by the numerous visitors at the Fair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe engraving presented herewith will give the reader, who has not seen\r\nthe article, a good idea of its appearance. It consists of a fabric\r\nrepresented below, half an inch thick, composed of fine wire springs,\r\neach one the length of the bed; all the three hundred spirals, being so\r\nwoven and braided together, in a double \"weave,\" by machinery, that\r\na sort of wire cloth is produced. It differs from any other material\r\nhitherto made, in that it has great strength and elasticity. There is,\r\nin fact, no other device, except the air or water bed, which can compare\r\nwith it in its elastic properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe are informed that nine hundred pounds of dead weight of wire were\r\nplaced on it for nearly five days, without injurious effects. This\r\nfabric is stretched on a frame, as seen in the first engraving, the\r\nproper tension is secured to suit the fancy, and the mattress is ready\r\nfor use. It is then set into the bedstead, like the ordinary spring bed,\r\nexcept that only two slats are used to support it. Thus, with a slight\r\ncovering in summer, and a thin hair mattress for warmth in winter, a\r\nmost perfect sleeping arrangement is secured.\r\n\r\nThe first adaptation of the wire mattresses was for private houses, but\r\nthey have been found to have special advantages for hospital use. They\r\nhave been largely introduced into the Hartford Hospital, the Bellevue\r\nHospital, New York, and the Marine Hospital, Brooklyn, and have proved\r\nto be, after months of the severest use, with all classes of patients,\r\na very great success for such purposes. The elastic flexible mattresses\r\nyield to every motion and part of the body, much to the relief of the\r\nsuffering patient.\r\n\r\nAnother very great advantage is, that when carefully painted they are\r\nalways clean.\r\n\r\nPillows of the same materials are made soft and pliable by using a fine\r\nwire and small coil. They are always cool, and afford the opportunity of\r\nplacing bags of ice under the head in case of sickness.\r\n\r\nOne of these mattresses and a bedstead and pillows complete--all of\r\nwhich the Company make--furnish, with the addition of a folded blanket\r\nor comfortable, a perfect outfit for hospital use.\r\n\r\nThey are particularly useful for ships' berths, as they dispense with\r\nthe ordinary bottom, and the sacking and thick mattress. Shippers know\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWe are assured that a coating of paint, carefully applied to the\r\nwell-tinned wires will protect them from rust.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that these beds, with a light\r\ncovering--scarcely more than a sheet--are especially adapted for hot\r\nclimates. The Company have already orders for them for the Brazilian\r\nmarket, and they have been introduced into many of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThis wire fabric is adapted to other articles of furniture, and is used\r\nin place of the ordinary springs in chairs, sofas, etc. For out-door\r\nsettees, lounges, car seats, and other like purposes, it is well\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nThree patents have been issued to the Company on the wire mattress,\r\nthrough the Scientific American Patent Agency.

Bertchey's mill, at Milwaukee, burned in September last. The fire\r\noriginated from a candle held near a bran or feed spout, reaching from\r\nthe upper to a lower floor. The ignition was instant, and attained\r\ndifferent points of the building at about the same moment.\r\n\r\n\"On November 20, 1868, Schmidt & Co's mill, at St. Louis, burned in a\r\nsimilar manner, the light in this case being in a globe lamp, but the\r\nconflagration was, nevertheless, quite as sudden and general as in the\r\nfirst case cited. Other instances of like character have occurred quite\r\nrecently. And now the query is, What caused the disaster? Whence the\r\ncombustion?\r\n\r\n\"It has been conjectured that the bran-dust, or fine and dry powder,\r\npassing down or up these conductors, may be the kindling cause of the\r\nfire in these cases; but bran is not over combustible in itself, nor\r\ndo we know why it should become so when thus reduced to an impalpable\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n\"Another theory is that a gas arises from the transmuting grain, which,\r\nexcluded from surrounding atmosphere in these close conduits, becomes\r\ninflammable, and hence the results, as recited above, whenever a lighted\r\nflame is brought in contact therewith.\r\n\r\n\"Be the cause gas or dust, the disaster is the same: and is it not a\r\nphenomenon worth studying and remedying, so far as within the province\r\nand control of those most interested?\"\r\n\r\nSome similar instances came under our personal observation while\r\nadjuster for the Aetna at its western branch. The Star Mills at\r\nMascoutah, Ill., burned about the year 1864. They were grinding\r\nmiddlings. About three o'clock in the morning the miller in charge went\r\nup to the chamber (a large box extending through several stories), as he\r\nhad often done before, to jar the middlings down, they having clogged.\r\nHe carried a small, open oil lamp, which he placed on a beam, just\r\nbehind and above his head. He then opened a slide and thrust in a\r\nshovel, which started the middlings down with a thump, raising a great\r\ndust. As this dust issued in a thin cloud from the slide, it approached\r\nand touched the lamp, when instantly, as if it had been coal gas, it\r\nflashed, burning the miller's hair and beard, and filling the middlings\r\nbox with a sheet of flame, which spread with great rapidity and\r\ndestroyed the mill.\r\n\r\nA mill at Dover, Ky., had accumulated a large quantity of middlings in\r\nan upper story, when the weight caused some sagging, and a man was sent\r\nup with a shovel to \"even\" the bin. His pressure was the \"last straw,\"\r\nand the floor under the man broke through, pouring out a cascade of\r\nmiddlings, which flowed down from story to story, filling the mill with\r\nits dust. In a very few minutes it reached the boiler room, and the\r\ninstant it touched the fire it ignited with a flash, and the mills was\r\nin flames instantly. It was totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn this last named case the gas theory will not apply. The dust was not\r\nconfined in a spout, but was floating free in the air throughout the\r\nmill. The phenomenon was like the others mentioned, and seems to\r\nindicate that the fine dust itself, when floating in the air, is the\r\nfatal incendiary.\r\n\r\nThe subject is worthy of a scientific analysis, such as we have never\r\nseen bestowed upon it. The facts are well authenticated, but the\r\nphilosophy of such ignition is not generally understood.--_Insurance\r\nMonitor_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFire-Proof Buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It has long been a vexed problem with architects and builders, how to\r\nmake a building completely fire-proof without the enormous expense of\r\niron beams and girders, and even this has sometimes failed to prove a\r\ncomplete protection. In the building of the National State Bank, the\r\narchitect estimated that it could not be made fire-proof in the ordinary\r\nstyle for less than $6,000, and while hesitating as to the expense and\r\nseeking to provide some remedy against the dampness incident to iron\r\nbeams, Mr. Fowler learned from the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN that Edwin May,\r\nof Indianapolis, the well-known architect of our county jail, had taken\r\nletters patent on a fire-proof lath for ceilings and inside partition\r\nwalls, together with a concrete floor for the protection of the upper\r\nedge of the joist which by actual test had been demonstrated to be\r\nfire-proof. After a critical examination of the invention upon its\r\nmerits, it was adopted, and the workmen are now engaged in putting\r\nit in. Our citizens engaged in, or contemplating building, will be\r\ninterested in an examination of the work while in progress.\"\r\n\r\n[We copy the above from the _Lafayette_ (Indiana) _Courier_, and in this\r\nconnection we make the following extract from a letter just received by\r\nus from Mr. May, the inventor:\r\n\r\n\"You will see by the above notice one result of my advertisement in the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.

Editors:--As a constant reader of your invaluable paper, many\r\nsubjects of deep interest come under my observation, and doubtless no\r\njournal throughout the land contains more instructive reading--that\r\nwhich tends to accelerate the progress of scientific investigation,\r\nand promote the general interest of the people--than the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN. The series of articles under the head of \"Aerial Navigation,\"\r\ncommenced on page 309, volume XXI., has, perhaps, been read with as much\r\npleasure and interest as anything published in your valuable journal. I\r\nsay with pleasure--because it is really gratifying to mark the advancing\r\nsteps which inventors are making in this branch of science; and with\r\ninterest--because every new idea set forth, calculated to further the\r\nsuccess of aerial navigation, should be, and no doubt will be, regarded\r\nas of great importance by every one. And, as the more suggestions placed\r\nbefore the minds of those working for the improvement of any invention,\r\nthe greater number will they have from which to choose or experiment\r\nupon, I would like to make one suggestion here, which may be of some\r\nimportance in the construction and operation of the \"Aeroport,\" under\r\nthe supervision of Mr. Porter, of your city, a description of which is\r\ngiven on pages 346-7, volume XXI., of your paper.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the propelling wheels be placed in some other position\r\nthan that given in the said description. From what little knowledge I\r\npossess of aerial navigation, I am persuaded that it would take less\r\npower to propel the \"Aeroport\" at a given speed, if the wheels were\r\nplaced at the rear or front portion of the flying ship. My reason for\r\nbeing thus persuaded is, that as the forward and aft halves of the float\r\nare cone-shaped--the center being the base, and the front and rear\r\nends being the vertexes--there must be an increased velocity of the\r\natmosphere from front to aft as the aeroport advances. Consequently the\r\ndriving wheels being placed under the center or largest diameter of the\r\nfloat, they must evidently revolve with greater rapidity in the current\r\nof air passing between the float and the saloon, going in opposite\r\ndirection to that in which the aeroport is flying at a given speed, than\r\nthey would were they placed in front or behind where the atmosphere is\r\ncomparatively at rest. I take this view from the fact that steamboats\r\nand other vessels proceed with greater speed, with a given power, _down_\r\nstream than they do _up_ stream, mostly on account of the paddles\r\nstriking against the current flowing in the same direction in which the\r\nvessel is rowing. The propelling wheels placed either at the front or\r\nrear may have the axle extended through the end of the float to the\r\ncenter, and the cog-wheel, for the chain, placed on the inner end of\r\nthe axle, and the chain descending through the bottom of the float, and\r\nconnected to the engine in the same manner as given in your paper. The\r\nchain should be inclosed from the float to the saloon below, with a pipe\r\nof the same material as the float, and sufficiently large to insure the\r\nfree action of the chain, and the axle of the propellers should be made\r\ntight with suitable packing to prevent the escape of gas. However there\r\nmay be different arrangements employed for connecting the engine to the\r\nwheels. A shaft extending directly under the float, and reaching\r\nfrom the center to the axle supporting the propellers, and connected\r\ntherewith by means of side cog-wheels, might be used; and as the shaft\r\nwould necessarily diverge from a straight line with the said axle, the\r\nshaft having the chain-wheel on the end directly over the engine and\r\nconnected therewith in the manner proposed by Mr. Porter, I would\r\nsuggest further that it would, perhaps, be preferable to place the\r\nwheels at the front end, that the rudder might remain in its original\r\nposition, and the aeroport could swing behind the propellers on\r\nencountering side currents of air, and could thus be more easily guided.\r\nI firmly believe that Mr. Porter has taken \"the right step in the right\r\ndirection\" to accomplish that which has been so long sought, and which\r\nevidently will be accomplished at some future time. The air will yet be\r\nnavigated by numerous flying ships, going from one city to another like\r\nthose that now cover the broad bosom of our oceans.\r\n\r\nHIRAM VAN METER.\r\n\r\nMacomb, Ill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPuttying Floors of Jewelers Shops and Otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs.

I have an apron about one yard wide, and in the\r\ncorners of it are eyelet-holes, so that I can pin it to the bench when I\r\nam working; I have strings to it, but do not generally tie them around\r\nme, but let it be loose in my lap as I have to jump up, to attend to\r\ncustomers in the shop. In the shop where I learned my trade (in London,\r\nEngland), every workman was _compelled_ to wear an apron, and so much\r\nwaste of property and valuable time was saved; the saving of _time_ in\r\n_one week_ will more than pay the cost of the aprons.\r\n\r\nSidney Plains, N.

Editors:--I often think, on perusing your very valuable journal\r\nof science, and the numerous mechanical and scientific problems it\r\nunfolds, that the tendency of the age is to supersede all manual labor\r\nby machinery. Whether such a thing is possible is not the question for\r\nme to consider; I only know that the tendency of universal human genius\r\nseems directed to that end.\r\n\r\nI make the above observation casually, in order to introduce a few ideas\r\non the subject of improvement in agricultural implements--the great\r\n_desideratum_ of the West at this moment. Here nature has opened her\r\nstores so munificently, that all the husbandman has to do is to plow,\r\nsow, and garner the fruits of his labor. But two great improvements are\r\nneeded to enable the western farmer to keep pace with improvements in\r\nthe mechanic arts and other kindred employment. Indeed, we at the\r\nWest, particularly, need a good, cheap, steam plow that can be made\r\npracticable for at least the better grade of farmers. The English plan\r\nof moldboards, that overcome all possible traction and necessitate the\r\nduplex stationary engines, with the cumbrous \"artillery of attachments,\"\r\nmay do for sluggish people but will never meet the wants of the Yankee\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe steam plow suited to the genius of our people, must, to use a\r\nvulgarism, \"get up and go.\" It must possess sufficient power of\r\npropulsion and traction to pulverize the ground better, deeper, and\r\nmore rapidly than the \"old way.\" Such is the want of the great West\r\nin reference to preparing the soil for crops. I do not know of such a\r\nmachine in use, nor do I believe in the theory of Dr. Brainard, that the\r\nmoldboard is the only plan for properly pulverizing the soil; for I am\r\nsatisfied that such plan is wholly inadmissible in steam plowing in\r\nthis country, for want of sufficient traction for self-propulsion, and\r\nobservation has taught me that a self-propelling plow is the only steam\r\nplow our people will tolerate.\r\n\r\nI have lately examined the drawings of a steam plow invented by a\r\ngentleman of this city (which I am not at liberty to explain in detail)\r\nthat seems to meet the great want I have spoken of. The invention\r\nconsists in a very simple device, by which the whole force of\r\npulverizing the ground is applied to propel the machine, and if this be\r\nnot sufficient, an independent force may be applied, so arranged as to\r\ngovern the speed of the machine at the will of the operator. You will,\r\nno doubt, in due time hear more of this machine, which seems to me to\r\nmeet the great want so long experienced in Western cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe next great want of the West is a practical grain binder, that shall\r\nsecurely bind the grain as cut. The scarcity and high price of labor\r\nrenders such a machine an absolute necessity. The efforts to supply this\r\ngreat want have been numerous, but with no flattering success so far as\r\nI am able to learn, except the machine invented by a citizen of this\r\nplace, which has already made its mark by demonstrating that automatic\r\nmachinery can and does bind the grain as fast as cut. The machine I\r\nspeak of is yet in a chrysalis state, so to speak, but it has been\r\nworked two years in the field, the last season without missing a bundle,\r\nthough not without the usual difficulties of all new machines in respect\r\nto the workings of some parts--too weak, etc. It is believed that\r\nthe coming harvest will witness its triumphant success. If so, the\r\nproduction of our staple cereal will be greatly cheapened. I shall\r\nbe glad to renew \"old acquaintance,\" by a more detailed statement\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nI send enclosed the pay for another year of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,\r\nwhich I can no more do without than my accustomed dinner.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nMadison, Wis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomical Steam Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs.

The cylinder is 10-inch bore, and 14-inch stroke; steam chest\r\nextends enough beyond the ends of the cylinder so that the steam travels\r\nonly 2½ inches, the shortest distance possible, after leaving the valve\r\nbefore it reaches the piston-head, and the space between the piston-head\r\nand cylinder-head is only one-fourth of an inch, the bolt heads\r\nbeing counter-sunk until even. Other things about this engine are in\r\nproportion. With this engine attached to a direct acting circular mill,\r\nI can saw 2,000 feet of hard-wood inch boards in one hour.\r\n\r\nIf any of your readers can beat this, I would like to hear from them.\r\n\r\nJOHN CARNES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriction and Percussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Editors:--In reply to \"Spectrum,\" page 358, of last volume,\r\nI will be brief. In his third paragraph he claims that he has merely\r\n_suggested_ that friction and percussion may often be one and the same\r\nthing; and immediately claims that in the case of the polished button\r\nrubbing a planed pine board, the force which overcomes and levels the\r\nundulations of the wood, is percussion, and that percussion is also the\r\ncause of the heat; the microscopic hills and hollows on the shining\r\nbrass button skipping and jumping along the pine, produces little\r\ninfinitesimal bumpings, and so pound out the heat. This _little_ theory\r\nshould be known to the homeopaths--they could illustrate infinitesimal\r\nquantities by it!\r\n\r\n\"Spectrum\" treats my hammered horsenail illustration shabbily. After\r\nindirectly acknowledging that there is a point where hammering will\r\nno longer produce heat, he puts it on the grindstone, subjects it to\r\nfriction, and when it burns his fingers, throws his hat in the air and\r\nshouts \"Hurrah for _percussion!_\" We agree perfectly, except that he\r\ncalls hammering, _condensation_; calls friction, _percussion_; and drops\r\nfriction from the mechanical dictionary altogether.\r\n\r\nA railway car axle often heats and sets fire to the packing, when the\r\njournal is smooth as polished glass; but I never heard of those parts\r\nof the car which are constantly undergoing percussion, even getting\r\nuncomfortably warm. The natives of the South Pacific produce fire by\r\nrubbing pieces of dry wood together, but I never heard of their rapping\r\nsticks for the same purpose. I have seen a new, sharp knife made hot\r\nenough to raise a blister, whittling a clean dry stick of pine, and\r\nI would like to have \"Spectrum\" tell us, if in all the above cases\r\npercussion is the cause of the evolution of of heat, and what is\r\nfriction doing in the mean time.\r\n\r\nNew Albany, Ind.\r\n\r\nC.C.H.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOiling a Preservative of Brown Stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs.

But with so much at stake, no body seems to know what to do or say.\r\nBeing a practical painter, it has been my lot to oil some of the best\r\nfronts in New York, namely corner of 23d Street and 5th Avenue, No. 2,\r\nWest 23rd Street, also No. 1, West 30th Street; also the residence of\r\nE.S. Higgins, the carpet manufacturer, done by other journeymen.\r\n\r\nThey were very dark in color for a few weeks, but now after two years,\r\nthey are bleached almost as light as they were at first.\r\n\r\nThese fronts were cleaned whenever necessary, and then oiled with fresh\r\nraw linseed oil from the press, put on pretty much as carefully as in\r\nordinary varnish work. No second coat or lapping over of the oil. All\r\nwas put on at once that it would take without running down in streams.\r\n\r\nThe result: the oil penetrates into good dry stone probably 1½ inches,\r\nmaking the stone hard and flinty, as any stone cutter will soon find out\r\nif he tries to trim it.\r\n\r\nIt keeps the damp and therefore the frost out of the stone, as will be\r\nseen any foggy day, the damp running down in streams on the oiled stone,\r\nand the unoiled stone absorbing the dampness. It is therefore necessary\r\nto oil during dry weather.\r\n\r\nThe oil is especially beneficial to balustrades and carvings, as they\r\nare generally got out of soft stone. It is also beneficial underneath\r\nbalconies and porches, as the sun never has a chance to dry the stone in\r\nsuch situations before the frost flakes it.\r\n\r\nThis I send in part payment for the great deal I have learned from your\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nT.H.

I brought\r\nthe back volumes from Madras to Pekin, and am glad to refer to them here\r\nwhere I must depend upon myself.\r\n\r\nI have been building and repairing premises since I came here last year.\r\nI find the carpenters and masons are very much delighted with our tools,\r\nespecially our saws, planes, borers, vise, and hammers. Our lathe is a\r\nwonder. They use only the ancient spindle turned backwards and forwards\r\nby a treadle or by the left hand while the right guides the chisel or\r\nturning-tool, which cuts only half the time. They use only the turning\r\nsaw, which often fails them because it cannot be used in splitting wide\r\nboards in the middle, and in many other places. They are great sawyers,\r\nhowever. They stand heavy pine spars on end, if rather short, say 8\r\nfeet, the common length of many intended for making coffins, and cut\r\nthem up into three-eighths or half-inch stuff with great patience. A\r\nlonger one they will lean over and prop up, raising it towards the\r\nperpendicular as they advance. They must have some hard jobs. I have\r\njust measured a poplar plank in front of a coffin manufactory, which I\r\nfound to be 5 ft. 3 in. at the butt, 3 ft. 10 in. at the top, 8 feet\r\nlong, and about 8 inches thick. For a crosscut saw they rig one like\r\nour wood-saw. I am sure it would deeply interest you to make a visit to\r\nPekin and see how this ancient, patient, and industrious people do their\r\nwork. It is truly painful to see how much time they spend in making\r\nthe simplest tool for want of at least a few labor-saving appliances.\r\nDoubtless you have their tools on show in New York. They are to me an\r\ninteresting study, though I have been long familiar with the rude tools\r\nof the Hindoos. It is constantly suggested to me that we must have got\r\nmany hints from the Chinese, or else indeed they have taken hints from\r\nthe West; or again, which is perhaps the true solution, implements like\r\nwords have a common origin. I should think from what I have observed in\r\na short time, that the Chinese resemble the Europeans in their tools\r\nmore than the Hindoos--a thing I did not at all anticipate. A clever man\r\ncould write you an interesting chapter on the ways of the Pekinese,\r\nthe Chinese Manchus, Mongols, and the rest mixed together, though the\r\nChinese are confessedly the workers in wood, iron, and everything else.\r\nThe Manchus are mostly hangers on of the government, living mainly upon\r\na miserable monthly stipend.\r\n\r\nThe reading of your unequaled journal makes me interested in you as if\r\nyou were personal friends, and so I have run away with these pointless\r\nremarks.

Editors:--In a recent number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN I notice\r\nan ingenious method of teaching deaf and dumb persons to converse in\r\nthe dark, which is also applicable to blind mutes, and it brings to my\r\nrecollection a method which was in use among the \"telegraph boys\" some\r\nyears ago when I was one of them. Sometimes when we were visiting and\r\nasked to communicate to a \"brother chip,\" anything that it was not\r\nadvisable for the persons around us to know, a slight tap-tapping on the\r\ntable or chair would draw the attention of the party we asked to talk\r\nto, and then by his watching the forefinger of the writer, if across the\r\nroom, or if near enough, by placing the hand of the writer carelessly\r\non the shoulder of the party we desired to communicate with, the\r\ncommunication was written out in the telegraph alphabet or by taking\r\nhold of his hand and writing upon the finger.\r\n\r\nI think this method will be found much less complicated, if not quite as\r\nrapid, as the method with both hands, and much more convenient, as it is\r\nonly necessary to have hold of one hand of the person communicated with,\r\nand is more rapid than writing with a pen.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those not acquainted with the telegraph alphabet, I\r\ngive it:\r\n\r\n   A    B    C    D     E    F    G     H    I\r\n  .-  -...  ...  -..    .   .-.  --.  ....   ..\r\n\r\n   J     K     L    M    N    O     P     Q\r\n  -.-.  -.-   ---   --   -.  . .  .....  ..-.\r\n\r\n    R      S     T    U     V     W     X     Y\r\n   . ..   ...    -   ..-   ...-  .--   ..-.  .. ..\r\n\r\n   Z\r\n  ... .\r\n\r\nThe uninitiated will observe that O differs from I in the distance\r\nbetween the dots, made thus: I by two quick strokes of the forefinger; O\r\nby one quick stroke, slight pause, and another quick stroke; the dashes\r\nare made by holding the finger down for a short space: thus SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN would be written:\r\n\r\n    S    C    I   E  N   T   I   F   I    C\r\n   ...  .. .  ..  .  -.  -  ..  .-.  ..  .. .\r\n\r\n    A   M   E    R    I    C     A    N\r\n   .-  --   .   . ..  ..  .. .  .-    -.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time any one can learn to read by the sight or by the\r\ntouch.

To spell the same words in full by the mute\r\nalphabet referred to would require only twenty-three motions.

But these must be put into three\r\nor four cubic feet, or they will cost too much for covering, ties, etc.\r\nPerhaps you can furnish us with a wood-cut of some, or several, presses\r\nworked by hand, or by horse-power, that will do good service, not cost\r\ntoo much, be simple in operation, not require too much power, and be\r\neffective as above. It may be for the interest of some of your clients\r\nor correspondents to give us the facts, as we shall put them into\r\na report for circulation amongst the entire cotton interest of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nWALTER WELLS, _Sec'y_.\r\n\r\nNational Association of Cotton Manufacturers and Planters, No. 11,\r\nPemberton Square, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Singular Freak of a Magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Editors:--In my library hangs a powerful horseshoe magnet which\r\nhas a keeper and a weight attached of about three ounces. This weight\r\nis sustained firmly by the attracting power of the magnet, and is not\r\neasily shaken off by any oscillating motion, yet through some (to me)\r\nunknown cause during each of the last ten nights the magnet has lost its\r\npower, and the keeper and weight lie in the morning on the bottom of the\r\ncase where the magnet has hung for many years without a like occurrence,\r\nexcept once on the occasion of a severe shock of an earthquake which\r\ntook place December 17, 1867.\r\n\r\nThere is no possible way for this magnet to be disturbed except by the\r\nelectric current; then why should its power thus return without the aid\r\nof a battery or keeper?

HENRY E. COLTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is wanted is something equally applicable to large or small pieces\r\nof iron, and which will answer to ward off the attacks not only of the\r\ncommon atmospheric oxygen, but also remain unaffected by acids or salt\r\nwaters.\"\r\n\r\nThe above from a late number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN states not only\r\nthe writer's ideas but also one of the greatest wants of the age. Iron\r\nis daily being put to more and more varied uses. On land the great\r\nquestion is what will prevent rust; on water, what will prevent rust and\r\nfouling of bottoms of iron vessels. We will briefly summarize the many\r\npatents granted for this purpose.\r\n\r\nEight are for sheathing of various kinds put on in varied modes. The\r\nmost practicable of these is a system prepared by Daft. Most iron\r\nvessels are now constructed by every other plate lapping the edges of\r\nthe one between. He proposes, instead of having the plates all the same\r\nwidth, to have one wide and one very narrow plate. This would leave a\r\ntrough between the two wide plates of the depth of the thickness of the\r\nplates. He proposes to force into this trough very tightly pieces of\r\nteak, and to the teak, thus embedded, he nails a sheathing of zinc. The\r\nzinc is kept clean by slowly wearing away of its surface from action by\r\ncontact with the iron and salt water.\r\n\r\nThere are four patents, in which various, so-called, non-conducting\r\ncoats are put on the iron, and copper pigment in some form put on over\r\nthem. These have been specially condemned in England, as no matter how\r\ngood the non-conducting substance--and many are so only in name--it will\r\nbecome rubbed off at some points, and there the bottom will be eaten\r\nboth by salt water and action of copper.\r\n\r\nCoal tar and asphaltum are the subjects of patents in various forms.\r\n\r\nOne patent claims rubber or gutta-percha dissolved in linseed oil as a\r\nvehicle in which to grind the pigment; another the same dissolved in\r\nnaphtha or bisulphide of carbon as a pigment; another hard rubber,\r\nground.\r\n\r\nEnameling with different materials is proposed by some, while one\r\nproposes to glaze the bottoms so that barnacles and grass would find a\r\nslippery foothold.\r\n\r\nCombinations of tallow, resin, and tar--mineral and pine--are patented\r\nmostly to use over other paints.\r\n\r\nCoal tar, sulphur, lime, and tallow, are the subject of one patent;\r\nguano, red lead, and oil of another; while sulphur and silica are\r\nclaimed by a third.\r\n\r\nPaints containing mercury, arsenic, and even strychnine, are the\r\nsubjects of several patents. A mixture of coal tar and mercurial\r\nointment of one.\r\n\r\nGalvanism is proposed to be used in various ways--strips of copper and\r\nzinc, or by galvanizing the plates before use. Black lead finds a place\r\nin many compositions.\r\n\r\nOne patent, by a complicated process, effects a union of metallic zinc\r\nand iron; this, granulated and ground fine, then mixed with red lead\r\nand oil, makes the paint. It is said to be the best of all the patented\r\nstuffs.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how many use oils derived from coal, peat, or resin,\r\nand tars of the same.\r\n\r\nThere are about fifty patents for this object and with all of them\r\nbefore their eyes, the British Society for the Advancement of Art still\r\nhold the $5,000 reward for a pigment or covering which will perfectly\r\nprotect from rust and fouling. However they may puff their products for\r\nselling, no one has the temerity to claim that they deserve the reward.\r\n\r\nWe think it would be difficult to find so many expedients ever before\r\nadopted for the accomplishment of any one object. These are all English\r\npatents, England having necessarily been obliged to use iron for vessels\r\nfrom its cheapness as well as its consequent first introduction there.\r\nIn the United States no patents worth mentioning have been granted.\r\n\r\nThe first requisites for a pigment or coating for iron are, that it\r\nshould not contain any copper--the corrosive action of that metal on\r\niron being intense. Then if for work exposed to air it should form\r\nsuch a coating as to be impervious to that gaseous fluid, and be\r\nso constituted chemically as not to be oxidizable by it; if under\r\nwater--especially sea water--to be impermeable to moisture, so elastic\r\nas not to crack, so insoluble as not to chloridize; to form a perfect,\r\napparently hard, coating: and yet wear just enough to keep off\r\nincrustation, barnacles, or growth of grass. In fact, this slow wearing\r\naway is the only preventive of fouling in iron vessels. Wooden bottoms\r\nmay be poisoned by solutions of copper--and that metal has no superior\r\nfor such uses, especially when it is combined in mixture with mineral\r\nor resinous tars and spirits--these compounds, however, are not only\r\nuseless on iron bottoms, but also injurious. What then is _the_\r\nsubstance: 1st. One of the oxides of lead (red lead). 2d. The purest\r\noxide of iron to be found. If properly made these articles can be\r\ncarried to no higher state of oxidation, and respectively, as to order\r\nnamed, they have no superiors for body and durability. By preference,\r\n1st, red lead, either out of or under water; 2d, Prince's oxide of iron\r\nonly, out of water. The color of these paints--the first red, the latter\r\nbrown, may be hidden by a coat of white or tinted color. If there were\r\nto be had in combination as a white paint, an oxide of lead and an oxide\r\nof zinc, it would be immensely superior to either, but that such has not\r\nbeen produced is rather the fault of carelessness than of possibility.\r\nZinc protects iron with great effect, but it is too rapidly worn in the\r\neffort to be of lasting value. Hence the great desideratum, the yet to\r\nbe, the coming pigment is a white oxide of lead or a combined white\r\noxide of lead and white oxide of zinc, without sulphates or chlorides.\r\n\r\nThose materials answer very well for work exposed to atmospheric air,\r\nand perhaps nothing will ever be found better; but a different need is\r\nthat for salt water. No mere protector of the iron from rust can be\r\nfound superior to pure red lead and linseed oil. We have seen a natural\r\ncombination of zinc, lead, and iron, which, in our experience, ranks\r\nnext; but the zinc is acted on by the chloride of sodium, and wears away\r\ntoo much of the material. Red lead, however, while covering the iron\r\nperfectly and effectually preventing rust, and also having but little\r\ndisposition to chloridize, when it does, will foul both with grass and\r\nbarnacles. Hence, the first desideratum being obtained, how shall we\r\naccomplish the other. The prevention of fouling may be accomplished in\r\ntwo ways: First, cover the vessel's bottom with two or even three coats\r\nof red lead, and give each time to dry hard. Then melt in an iron pot a\r\nmixture of two parts beeswax, two parts tallow, and one part pine resin;\r\nmix thoroughly, and apply hot one or two coats. This mixture may be\r\ntinted with vermilion or chrome green. It is not necessary to use any\r\npoisonous substance, as it is only by its softness and gradual wear\r\nthat it is kept clean. Second, mix red lead and granular metallic zinc,\r\nground fine, or such a mineral as we have mentioned--crystalline and\r\ngranular in its character. Put on two or three coats, and allow each to\r\nset--they will never dry hard. The zinc will slowly wear off, keeping\r\nthe whole surface clean, while there will be left enough coating of the\r\nlead to preserve the iron from rust. The oil I would urge for these\r\npigments is linseed--as little boiled as possible, to be thinned with\r\nspirits of turpentine. There seems to have been a mania for mixtures of\r\ntar and resins, their spirits and oils; my experience fails to show me\r\nany advantage for them on an iron bottom. They have neither elasticity\r\nnor durability, while linseed oil has both in a pre-eminent degree, and\r\nis no more likely to foul than they, when in a combination that does\r\nnot dry hard. Besides they are difficult to grind, inconvenient to\r\ntransport, and offensive to use.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we have not, in the opinion of some, answered the want expressed\r\nin the first paragraph. No pigment with the requisites of durability and\r\ncheapness will resist the attacks of strong acids on iron. The first we\r\nhave mentioned will--all such as may float in our air from factories or\r\nchemical works. Chemically it is converted by nitric acid and chlorine\r\ninto an insoluble substance--plumbic acid or the cyanide of lead. An\r\nexperience of more than three years, with almost unlimited means at our\r\ncommand for experiment, demonstrates to us that we have indicated\r\nthe means of filling the other requisites asked for. It may be that\r\nsomething new will be discovered, but we doubt it. Let any one tread the\r\nroad we have trod, investigate and experiment where and as much as we\r\nhave, and, if that place is, where we have not, and their experience\r\nwill be the same as ours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANANAS AND PLANTAINS OF THE TROPICS.\r\n\r\n[For the Scientific American.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPoets have celebrated the banana plant for its beauty, its luxuriance,\r\nthe majesty of its leaves, and the delicacy of its fruit; but never have\r\nthey sufficiently praised the utility of this tropical product.\r\nThose who have never lived in southern countries are unable to fully\r\nappreciate its value. Some look even with indifference upon the gigantic\r\nclusters of this fruit, as they are unloaded from the steamers and\r\nsailing vessels; and yet they deserve special attention and admiration,\r\nfor they are to the inhabitants of the torrid zone, what bread and\r\npotatoes are to those of the north temperate zone.\r\n\r\nThe banana tree is one of the most striking illustrations of tropical\r\nfertility and exuberance. A plant, which in a northern climate, would\r\nrequire many years to gain strength and size, is there the production of\r\nten or twelve months. The native of the South plants a few grains, taken\r\nfrom an old tree, in a moist and sandy soil, along some river or lake;\r\nthey develop with the greatest rapidity, and at the end of ten months\r\nthe first crop may be gathered, though the cluster and bananas are yet\r\nsmall; but the following year one cluster alone will weigh some sixty or\r\nmore pounds. Even in the South they are always cut down when green, as\r\nthey lose much of their flavor when left to ripen or soften on the tree.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the tree, if it may be so called, and which grows to a\r\nhight of some fifteen feet, is formed only by the fleshy part of the\r\nlarge leaves, some of which attain a length of eighteen feet, and are\r\ntwo and a half feet in width. While from an upper sprout you perceive\r\nthe large yellow flowers, or already formed fruits, you see underneath a\r\ncluster, which is bending the tree by its weight.\r\n\r\nThe plantain tree is much the same as the banana, with the difference,\r\nhowever, that its fruit cannot be eaten raw, like the banana's, and that\r\nit is much larger in size. Almost every portion of the banana tree is\r\nuseful. First of all, the nutritious fruit. The plantains when green and\r\nhard, are boiled in water or with meat like our potatoes, or they are\r\ncut in slices and fried in fat, when they are soft and ripe. There is a\r\nsingularity about the boiled plaintain, worthy of being mentioned. Pork\r\nespecially, and other meats are so exceedingly fat in the tropics that\r\nthey would be most disgusting or even impossible to eat with either\r\nbread or potatoes, but the plaintain seems to neutralize or absorb all\r\nthe greasy substance, and the fattest meat is thus eaten by natives and\r\nforeigners without the least inconvenience.\r\n\r\nRipe bananas are mashed into a paste, of which the natives bake a sort\r\nof bread, which is very nourishing, though somewhat heavy. This paste,\r\nwhich contains much starch, can be dried, and thus kept for a length of\r\ntime, which is often of great service to mariners. The young sprouts are\r\nused and prepared like vegetables, and the fibrous parts of the stalks\r\nof the majestic leaves are used like manilla for ropes and coarse cloth.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the leaves is a theme rich enough to fill a volume; they\r\nare used to cover the huts, for table-cloths and napkins, or wrapping\r\npaper. The dough of bread, instead of being put in a pan, into the oven,\r\nis spread on a piece of plantain leaf; it will neither crisp nor adhere\r\nto the bread when taken out. The Indians of America carry all their\r\nproducts, such as maize, sugar, coffee, etc., in bags made of this leaf,\r\nwhich they know how to arrange so well, that they transport an \"arroba,\"\r\nor twenty-five pounds any distance without a single grain escaping, and\r\nwithout any appliance other than a liana or creeper to tie it up with.\r\nAs to the medicinal qualities of the leaves, they are numerous. Indeed,\r\na book has been written upon them. I speak, however, from my own\r\nexperience. The young, yet unrolled leaves are superior to any salve\r\nor ointment. If applied to an inflamed part of the body, the effect is\r\nsoothing and cooling, or if applied to a wound or ulcer, they excite\r\na proper healthy action, and afterwards completely heal the wound.\r\nDecoctions made of the leaves are used among the natives for various\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the world this plant has ranked among the first\r\nin the Flora of Asia. The Christians of the orient look upon it as the\r\ntree of Paradise which bore the forbidden fruit, and they think its\r\nleaves furnished the first covering to our original parents. According\r\nto other historians, the Adam's fig was the plant, which the messengers\r\nbrought from the promised land to Moses, who had sent them out to\r\nreconnoitre. \"It is under the shade of the _musa sapientium_, that,\" as\r\nrecorded by Pliny, \"the learned Indians seated themselves to meditate\r\nover the vicissitudes of life, and to talk over different philosophic\r\nsubjects, and the fruit of this tree was their only food.\" The Oriental\r\nChristians, up to the present date, regard the banana almost with\r\nreverence; their active fancy beholds in its center, if a cut is made\r\ntransverse, the image of the cross, and they consider it a crime to use\r\na knife in cutting the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the holy language of the Hindoo, the Sanscrit, the Adam's fig is\r\ncalled \"modsha,\" whence doubtless, the word \"musa\" is derived. It is\r\ngenerally believed that the plant came from India to Egypt in the\r\nseventh century; it still forms a most important article of commerce in\r\nthe markets of Cairo and Alexandria. In the year 1516, the banana was\r\nbrought to the West Indian Islands by a monk, since which time it\r\nhas rapidly spread over the tropics of America, and is found to the\r\ntwenty-fifth degree north and south of the equator. It is equally\r\nindispensable and is appreciated by the immigrant and by the native as\r\na beautifier of the landscape; affording shelter from the sun and rain,\r\nand giving bread to the children; for if every other crop should fail,\r\nthe hungry native looks up to the banana tree, like a merchant to his\r\nwell-filled storehouse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING UP STOVES.\r\n\r\nBY MARK TWAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not remember the exact date of the invention of stoves, but it was\r\nsome years ago. Since then mankind have been tormented once a year, by\r\nthe difficulties that beset the task of putting them up, and getting the\r\npipes fixed. With all our Yankee ingenuity no American has ever invented\r\nany method by which the labor of putting up stoves can be lessened. The\r\njob is as severe and vexatious as humanity can possibly endure, and gets\r\nmore so every year.\r\n\r\nMen always put their stoves up on a rainy day. Why, we know not; but we\r\nnever heard of any exception to this rule. The first step to be taken is\r\nto put on a very old and ragged coat, under the impression that when he\r\ngets his mouth full of plaster it will keep the shirt bosom clean. Next,\r\nthe operator gets his hand inside the place where the pipe ought to go,\r\nand blacks his fingers, and then he carefully makes a black mark down\r\nthe side of his nose. It is impossible to make any headway, in doing\r\nthis work, until this mark is made down the side of the nose. Having got\r\nhis face properly marked, the victim is ready to begin the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe head of the family--who is the big goose of the sacrifice--grasps\r\none side of the bottom of the stove, and his wife and the hired girl\r\ntake hold of the other side. In this way the load is started from the\r\nwoodshed toward the parlor. Going through the door, the head of the\r\nfamily will carefully swing his side of the stove around and jam his\r\nthumb nail against the door post. This part of the ceremony is never\r\nomitted. Having got the family comfort in place, the next thing is to\r\nfind the legs. Two of these are left inside the stove since the spring\r\nbefore. The other two must be hunted after, for twenty-five minutes.\r\nThey are usually found under the coal. Then the head of the family holds\r\nup one side of the stove while his wife puts two of the legs in place,\r\nand next he holds up the other while the other two are fixed, and one of\r\nthe first two falls out. By the time the stove is on its legs he gets\r\nreckless, and takes off his old coat, regardless of his linen.\r\n\r\nThen he goes for the pipe and gets two cinders in his eye. It don't make\r\nany difference how well the pipe was put up last year it will always be\r\nfound a little too short or a little too long. The head of the family\r\njams his hat over his eyes and taking a pipe under each arm goes to the\r\ntin shop to have it fixed. When he gets back, he steps upon one of the\r\nbest parlor chairs to see if the pipe fits, and his wife makes him get\r\ndown for fear he will scratch the varnish off from the chairs with the\r\nnails in his boot heel. In getting down he will surely step on the cat,\r\nand may thank his stars that it is not the baby. Then he gets an old\r\nchair and climbs up to the chimney again, to find that in cutting the\r\npipe off, the end has been left too big for the hole in the chimney. So\r\nhe goes to the woodshed and splits one side of the end of the pipe with\r\nan old axe, and squeezes it in his hands to make it smaller.\r\n\r\nFinally he gets the pipe in shape, and finds the stove does not stand\r\ntrue. Then himself and wife and the hired girl move the stove to the\r\nleft, and the legs fall out again. Next it is to move to the right. More\r\ndifficulty now with the legs. Move to the front a little. Elbow not even\r\nwith the hole in the chimney, and the head of the family goes again to\r\nthe woodshed after some little blocks. While putting the blocks under\r\nthe legs, the pipe comes out of the chimney. That remedied, the elbow\r\nkeeps tipping over, to the great alarm of the wife. Head of the family\r\ngets the dinner table out, puts the old chair on it, gets his wife to\r\nhold the chair, and balances himself on it to drive some nails into the\r\nceiling. Drops the hammer on wife's head. At last he gets the nails\r\ndriven, takes a wire swing to hold the pipe, hammers a little here,\r\npulls a little there, takes a long breath, and announces the ceremony\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nJob never put up any stoves. It would have ruined his reputation if he\r\nhad. The above programme, with unimportant variations, will be carried\r\nout in many respectable families during the next six weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC LANTERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of the magic lantern dates back to 1650, and is attributed\r\nto Professor Kircher, a German philosopher of rare talents and extensive\r\nreputation. The instrument is simple and familiar. It is a form of the\r\nmicroscope. The shadows cast by the object are, by means of lenses,\r\nfocussed upon something capable of reflection, such as a wall or screen.\r\nNo essential changes in the principles of construction have been made\r\nsince the time of Kircher; but the modern improvements in lenses,\r\nlights, and pictures, have raised the character of the instrument from\r\nthat of a mere toy to an apparatus of the highest utility. By its\r\nemployment the most wonderful forms of creation, invisible, perhaps, to\r\nthe eye, are not only revealed but reproduced in gigantic proportions,\r\nwith all the marvelous truth of nature itself. The success of some of\r\nthe most celebrated demonstrations of Faraday, Tyndall, Doremus, Morton,\r\nand others, was due to the skillful use of the magic lantern. As an\r\neducator, the employment of this instrument is rapidly extending. No\r\nschool apparatus is complete without it; and now that transparencies\r\nare so readily multiplied by photography upon glass, and upon mica, or\r\ngelatin, by the printing press or the pen, it is destined to find\r\na place in every household; for in it are combined the attractive\r\nqualities of beauty, amusement, and instruction.\r\n\r\nThe electric light affords, probably, the strongest and best\r\nillumination for the magic lantern; then comes the magnesium light; but\r\ntheir use is a little troublesome and rather expensive; next to these\r\nin illuminating power is the oxy-hydrogen or Drummond light. The\r\npreparation of the gases and the use of the calcium points involve\r\nconsiderable skill.\r\n\r\nNeed has long been felt for some form of the magic lantern, having a\r\nstrong light, but more easily produced than any of those just mentioned;\r\nand this has at last been accomplished, after several years' study and\r\nexperiment, by Prof. L.J. Marcy, 632 Arch St., Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sciopticon,\" is the name of his new instrument, and from actual\r\ntrial we find that it possesses many superior qualities. Its lenses\r\nare excellent, and in illuminating power its light ranks next to the\r\noxy-hydrogen. The sciopticon light is produced from ordinary coal oil\r\nby an ingenious arrangement of double flames, intensifying the heat and\r\nresulting in a pencil of strong white light. Prof. Marcy's instrument\r\nis the perfection of convenience, simplicity, and safety. Any one may\r\nsuccessfully work it and produce the most brilliant pictures upon\r\nthe screen. It is peculiarly adapted for school purposes and home\r\nentertainment. Those who wish to do a good thing for young people\r\nshould provide one of these instruments. Photographic transparencies of\r\nremarkable places, persons, and objects, may now be purchased at small\r\ncost; while there is no end to the variety of pictures which may be\r\ndrawn by hand at home upon mica, glass or gelatin, and then reproduced\r\nupon the screen by the sciopticon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Largest Well in the World--Capacity 1,000,000 Gallons of Water per\r\nDay.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the grand necessities of the Prospect Park, Brooklyn, N.Y., that\r\nof providing for a continual supply of water for all the purposes of\r\nthe Park developed itself, as the Commissioners progressed with their\r\nstupendous undertaking. Mr. Stranahan, the President of the Board, after\r\ncarefully weighing the cost, the practicability, and importance\r\nof having an independent water supply for the Park, advised the\r\nCommissioners of the plan which had suggested itself, and the\r\ncalculations which had been made by the engineers relative to the\r\nproject, and the work was commenced, the first idea being to secure at\r\nleast a partial supply of water by means of a well constructed in the\r\nPark. The subject was thus treated in the last annual report of Mr. C.C.\r\nMartin, the engineer in charge:\r\n\r\n\"This well has been located on the south side of Lookout Hill, near the\r\nlake, and work was commenced upon it late in the season. After a careful\r\nconsideration of various methods for sinking the well, it was decided to\r\nbuild the wall and then to excavate the material from within, trusting\r\nto the weight of the wall to force it down. Sixteen feet of the wall\r\nwere laid securely bolted together, before the excavation was commenced.\r\nA derrick with a boom fifty-five feet in length was set up near the\r\nwall, so that the sweep of the boom commanded the interior of it.\r\nIron buckets containing fourteen cubic feet each were obtained, and a\r\nsix-horse power hoisting engine purchased. With these appliances the\r\nexcavation was commenced, and carried on with slight interruption until\r\nthe work was suspended on account of the frost.\"\r\n\r\nThe well is now completed, and is one of the most important features of\r\nthe Park. It is worthy to rank as a feat of engineering skill with, any\r\nof the great works of modern times. The Commissioners decided to put its\r\npowers to the test yesterday afternoon, but owing to the unpropitious\r\nweather of the forenoon the trial was postponed. Nevertheless,\r\nCommissioners Stranahan, Fiske, and Haynes, with Mr. Martin, engineer in\r\ncharge, and Mr. John Y. Culyer, his assistant, were at the well. During\r\nthe last summer some difficulties were encountered in the sinking of the\r\nwall, which were set down by superficial observers as the utter failure\r\nof the enterprise. Mr. Stranahan received but little encouragement from\r\nhis fellow Commissioners, some of whom had never seen greater works\r\nof engineering than the construction of street sewers. He assumed the\r\nresponsibility of seeing the work through, feeling that the whole thing\r\ndepended entirely upon the ability of the engineers, in which he had\r\nabundant faith. All obstacles were surmounted; the work proceeded and\r\nthe well is now finished, and so far as is known, is understood to be\r\nthe largest one in the world.\r\n\r\nThe outer wall is fifty feet in diameter, two feet thick, and fifty-four\r\nfeet high. The inner curb, or wall, is thirty-five feet in diameter and\r\ntwo feet thick, having a depth of ten feet. The masonry, as seen from\r\nthe top of the structure, is a marvel of neatness and solidity. The\r\nwater surface in the well is thirteen feet above high-tide level, and\r\nthe depth of water in the well is fourteen feet. The pump foundations\r\nare entirely independent of the walls. This plan was adopted so as to\r\nobviate any possible difficulty which might arise from displacement. The\r\npump is the Worthington patent, and, with a pressure of forty pounds, is\r\ncapable of raising one million gallons of water every twenty-four hours\r\na height of 176 feet, and is competent to a lift of 180 feet.\r\n\r\nThe boiler house is a neat, pressed-brick structure trimmed with Ohio\r\nstone, standing on the surface near the mouth of the well. The interior\r\nof the well is reached by a spiral stairway built in the wall, and\r\ncommencing in the boiler house. In this way the engineer is able to\r\nreach the pump. It is a fact worthy of notice in connection with the\r\nconstruction of the wall, or rather the sinking of it, that the outer\r\nwall rests upon four feet of wooden cribwork, two feet thick, and having\r\nan iron shield. The inner wall is built upon a similar crib only two\r\nfeet deep, also shielded with iron.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners were led to the construction of this well in presence\r\nof the danger at any time of some accident taking place in connection\r\nwith the Brooklyn Water Works which would render it necessary for the\r\nWater Board to cut off the Park supply so as to secure the citizens from\r\nsuffering. This well has more than the necessary capacity to supply the\r\nPark abundantly with water, yielding most when most is needed. This is\r\nestablished by the discovery that the time of drought from which the\r\nwell is, or may be, likely to suffer, occurs in the Fall. Besides these\r\nfacts, it further appears that in order to furnish the supply of water\r\nto the Park the Water Board would have to go through the process of\r\npumping their water twice to convey it to the required elevation, equal\r\nto 225 feet from its original level.\r\n\r\nThe work of the well will be to supply the pools at an elevation of 133\r\nfeet. From the pools the water is conducted to the lake. Besides this,\r\nthere is an independent connection with the lake by which, as necessity\r\nmay suggest, the water can be directed to the lake, a lift of only\r\nseventy feet. The lake, when completed, will occupy an area of fifty\r\nacres, which will be kept continually supplied with fresh water, the\r\narrangements being such, or to be such, as will insure a permanent\r\nchange of water, and prevent any of the evils that may arise from\r\nstagnancy. The well is fed from the earth, consisting of a circuit of\r\ntwo miles, with a fall of five feet to the mile. For this reason it does\r\nnot appear easy to exhaust the supply, as when the water is pumped out\r\nto four or five feet from the surface of the well it is replaced at a\r\nrate equal to the demand. Every allowance has been made for evaporation\r\nfrom the lake and pools, and the supply is regarded as inexhaustible.\r\nAnother important fact here suggests itself; that is, that sufficient\r\nrain falls during the season in the area of two miles around the well\r\nto make the supply perennial. The Prospect Park well is a credit to\r\nBrooklyn.--_New York Times_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER FOR BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers will find in another column an advertisement of this new\r\nbuilding material which is now attracting much attention in the West,\r\nand of which we have received very favorable reports. It has been\r\nrecently tested in Chicago with the result we are informed of fully\r\nestablishing its utility. It is said that a house twenty-two feet long,\r\nsixteen wide, and fourteen high, can be covered on the outside for less\r\nthan $9; and a house thirty-six feet by twenty-two, and twenty feet\r\nhigh, for $20. The building can be done at any season, and can be\r\nfinished with great speed, and there are said to be numerous other\r\nadvantages connected with the use of the paper. It differs from ordinary\r\npaper in consistency, compactness and solidity. In the manufacture it\r\nis subjected to a pressure of hundreds of tuns, which squeezes out the\r\nliquid matter, leaving a substance of the right thickness. It is said to\r\nbe proof against damp and gnawing of vermin, and it being an excellent\r\nnon-conductor of heat, must make a warm dwelling in winter and a cool\r\none in summer. It is used in the place of plastering for inside walls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Government has military maps of every foot of its territory\r\nso complete that every hill, ravine, brooklet, field, and forest is\r\ndelineated with perfect accuracy. It is a common boast of Prussian\r\nmilitary men, that within the space of eight days 848,000 men can be\r\nconcentrated to the defense of any single point within the kingdom, and\r\nevery man of them will be a trained and well-equipped soldier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Muzzle-Pivoting Gun.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for the following able description and criticism of this\r\nPrussian gun to our able contemporary, _The Engineer_.\r\n\r\nViewed as a piece of mechanism, nothing can well be more beautiful\r\nin mutual adaptation of parts to the fulfillment of given and\r\nrather recondite movements, and in point of execution, than this\r\nmuzzle-pivoting arrangement of Herr Gruson's; but having said this we\r\nare compelled to add, as impartial engineering critics, that it is\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRUSON'S SYSTEM OF MUZZLE-PIVOTING APPLIED TO MONITORS.]\r\n\r\nA very few words of description, aided by the very clear engraving\r\nannexed, will suffice to make the arrangement plain to every mechanical\r\nreader. The entire structure is metallic, chiefly of cast iron or of\r\nsteel. Upon the platform of the casemate, or deck of the ship, or\r\nturret, is laid the heavy bed or traverse plate, cast hollow in iron,\r\nholding the vertical pivot at its forward end, on which the gun slide\r\ntraverses in azimuth, and at its rear end the segment plate, bolted down\r\nand separately adjustable as to position upon the bedplate. The slide is\r\nalso a ponderous hollow casting, the upper surfaces of which, on which\r\nthe gun carriage runs forward or recoils, are curvilinear in a vertical\r\nplane, so that the inclination to the horizon is greatest at the rear\r\nend. At the rear end of the slide it traverses upon two heavy cast-iron\r\nturned conical rollers, which are geared together and actuated by the\r\nwinch handle and spur gear, seen in our engraving; by these the slide\r\nis practically held fast in any position on the bedplate. The gun\r\nitself--in the model, a steel breech-loader, on the Prussian regulation\r\nsystem, very slightly modified--is sustained between two high and\r\nponderous cheek plates of cast iron, which constitute the sides of the\r\ncarriage, and which are connected together strongly at the lower edges\r\nby a heavy base or bottom plate, and at the top by two light cross\r\ndistance bolts. The muzzle and breech extremities of the piece project\r\nwell beyond those cheeks. Along the bottom of the trough of the\r\ncarriage, directly under the gun, lies a nearly horizontal hydraulic\r\npress cylinder, the pump and handle actuating which are seen in the\r\nfigures to the proper left of the gun, and the supply of water for which\r\nis contained in the hollow bottom of the carriage. On each side cheek of\r\nthe carriage is formed, by curved planing, a circular segmental race,\r\nopening inward or toward each other, rectangular in cross section and\r\ninto each of which is fitted a segmental block just filling it up, and\r\noccupying a portion of its length so as to slide easily up or downward\r\nthrough the whole range of the arc or segment.\r\n\r\nThe center point of the length of each of those blocks carries one side\r\nof the gun, which is connected also with the two heavy radius bars\r\nseen outside the cheeks, and pivoted close to the segment races on the\r\noutside, and with a system of link work between the gun itself and the\r\ncrosshead of the ram of the hydraulic cylinder, which gives motion\r\nto the gun in elevation or depression, through a vertical arc, the\r\nimaginary center of which, and of the segments of the side cheeks, is\r\nsituated in the horizontal diameter across the muzzle of the gun. This\r\nis in brief the muzzle-pivoting part of the arrangement, of which, were\r\nit worth while to go into its details, we should need some further\r\ndiagrams to make it quite clear. Nor is it worth while to go into\r\nthe description of various minor points of refinement about the gun\r\nmounting, such as the very exposed long tangent scale seen in the\r\nfigure, by which the elevation or depression is read off, nor the still\r\nmore exposed and rather ricketty arrangement by which the rear sight\r\nis arranged to rise and fall with the gun, and allowance for dispart\r\navoided. The recoil of the gun is resisted through and by the segment\r\nblocks in the side cheeks, and by the heavy radius bars, etc., and\r\nthus transferred to the carriage itself. This moves upon four\r\neccentro-concentric rollers, in all respects identical with those\r\nbrought before the Ordnance Select Committee of Woolwich by Mr. Mallet,\r\nin 1858--then rejected, after some time adopted, and brought into use in\r\nour own service, where they are now universal, and from which they have\r\nbeen adopted into every artillery in the world, and, we understand,\r\nwithout the slightest recognition of the inventor's rights. On the axle\r\nof each of these rollers is keyed a circular eccentric cam plate, those\r\nat the same side being connected together by a linking bar so as to move\r\nin concert. Adjustable tripping plates attached to the sides of the\r\nslide, are so arranged that when the loaded gun has been run forward its\r\ncarriage base rests hard down, with its full weight upon the top faces\r\nof the slide, and thus the recoil is made under the full resistance due\r\nto the friction of the entire load. Arrived at the highest point, it\r\nrests there until loaded. The cam plates being then given a slight\r\nmotion of rotation by the help of socket levers--the rectangular\r\nprojections to be received by which are seen on the top edges of the cam\r\nplates in the figure--the carriage, by its own commenced descent, gets\r\nagain upon its rollers, and runs forward upon these at once into firing\r\nposition. The two elevated horns which are seen standing up at the rear\r\npart of the slide above the roller frame are designed to receive the\r\nthump of the two short buffer-blocks--seen at the rear part of each\r\ncarriage cheek--in the event of the recoil not being wholly expended in\r\nraising the weight of gun and carriage, etc., along the curved racers\r\nof the slide. These buffer-blocks bear against plugs of vulcanized\r\nindia-rubber secured in the bottoms of the buffer cylinders.\r\n\r\nWe have thus, though very briefly, described the whole of this mounting.\r\nAs a carefully thought out and elaborated piece of elegant mechanical\r\ncomplication Herr Gruson's muzzle-pivoting carriage attracted much\r\nattention at Paris, in 1867, and its merits were regarded as great by\r\nthose whose thoughts went little further perhaps. We should have been\r\nglad had it been in our power to have joined in its praise. We are,\r\nhowever, obliged honestly to say that, however highly creditable to its\r\ndesigner as an ingenious and capable mechanism, it shows that he has\r\nnever realized to himself as a practical artillerist the primary, most\r\nabsolute, and indispensable conditions of construction for a serviceable\r\nmuzzle-pivoting gun for either land or sea service.\r\n\r\nAs to the general merits, or general conditions, of muzzle-pivoting,\r\nhowever, once in doubt at first, these are admitted now by all; and\r\nthe latter resolve themselves almost into this--that system of\r\nmuzzle-pivoting must be best which, while preserving the essential point\r\nof leaving the muzzle of the gun free of any direct attachment, i.e.,\r\nwith an imaginary, not an actual, pivot of vertical arc motion, shall be\r\n_the simplest possible_ in its parts, have the least details, the fewest\r\nparts capable of being struck by splinters or shot, and all its parts of\r\nsuch materials and character as to receive the smallest amount of injury\r\nif so struck. In every one of these aspects Herr Gruson's mounting is at\r\nfault. With parts and movements far more ingeniously adapted than those\r\nof the crude and unskillfully designed muzzle-pivoting carriages of\r\nCaptain Heathorn, also exhibited at Paris, and much exhibited and\r\nexposed since, the Gruson mounting is even more complicated, expensive,\r\nand liable to injury of every sort to which a gun carriage can be\r\nconceived liable. We may even venture to affirm that ponderous as\r\nwas the mass of cast iron, etc., in the Paris model carrying only a\r\n12-pounder gun, were it all enlarged in such ratio as might appear to\r\nsuit for a 10-inch 25-tun rifled gun of the British type, the almost\r\nproverbial relations, between weight, velocity of impulse, and\r\nbrittleness of cast iron, would show themselves, in the whole machine\r\ngoing to pieces within a very few rounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStock Feeding by Clock Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. F. B. Robinson, of North Haven, Conn., has invented a very neat\r\narrangement, whereby horses or stock can be fed at any time required\r\nwith certainty and without personal attention at the time of feeding.\r\nHis invention consists of a hopper with a drop bottom in which the\r\nprovender is placed. A latch secures the drop bottom, the latch engaging\r\nwith a spring catch. A simple arrangement of clock work on the principle\r\nof the alarm clock, may be set to release the spring at any hour or\r\nminute desired, when the drop falls and the provender falls through a\r\nchute into the feeding trough. This invention may be adapted to feeding\r\nany number of horses or cattle, only one clock being required. We regard\r\nthe invention as one of much value. By its use much neglect of careless\r\nattendants may be obviated, and a farmer without help, might leave home\r\nfor an evening's entertainment, or absent himself on business, without\r\nfear that his stock would suffer. Besides being so convenient the cost\r\nof the apparatus is a mere bagatelle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk, and What Comes of It.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrange County has long been a laud flowing with milk and--butter. Three\r\nor four of these most beautiful autumn days were spent by us, says a\r\nwriter in _Harper's Weekly_, among the farmers which are supposed to\r\nbutter our New York city bread, and qualify our tea and coffee. Recent\r\nmechanical improvements have taken away much of the traditional romance\r\nof the farm, but, on the whole, the loss is more than made up by the\r\ngain of perfect system and wonderful adaptation. Instead of four or\r\nfive cows, known by such names as Brindle, Bess, and Sukey, milked by\r\nrosy-cheeked maidens, we have now droves of fifty or a hundred, milked\r\nby men, who know them only as \"good\" or \"poor milkers.\"\r\n\r\nIn some fine farms a large and luxuriant pasture, with running brooks\r\nand border of woodlands, affords, with the herd feeding in it, a\r\nbeautiful picture; and the substantial barns constructed to keep the\r\ncattle comfortably cool in summer and warm in winter, with ample\r\ndrinking troughs and stalls for fastening up at night, are indicative of\r\nthe good shelter at hand when winter storms drive the cows indoors. To\r\nthe farmyards the cows are brought night and morning, in summer, to be\r\nmilked. The strained milk is put into large cans holding forty quarts,\r\nsuch as the milkmen use in distributing it through the city. These cans\r\nare then put into tanks made in some cool running stream, where the\r\nwater comes nearly to the top of the can. Frequent stirring is necessary\r\nuntil the animal heat is quite gone. The milk is then fit to be sent\r\nto the cars. This process can never safely be omitted for, paradoxical\r\nthough it may seem, milk is \"fresher\" and sweeter when it reaches the\r\nconsumer if it is delayed at the farm for at least twelve hours. Even\r\nin hot weather, it is more certain to keep sweet when twenty-four or\r\nthirty-six hours elapse between the milking and the using in the city.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the best means of cooling milk\r\nfor market, and patent pails have been tried in which the milk passes\r\ndirectly from the cow through small, coiled tubes surrounded by ice.\r\nBut this rapid cooling does not work well, and practical experience\r\nindicates that the old simple process is the best. Every well-appointed\r\nfarm must have, therefore, a cool and unfailing stream of water. There\r\nare two such streams in one of the farms we visited. One passes through\r\nthe barn, furnishing drinking troughs for the cattle, and a tank for\r\ncooling milk in winter. The other, running through the pasture, supplies\r\na trout-breeding pond, and furnishes a tank for summer use. In a little\r\nhut under the trees, the milk cans are kept in a stream, which even\r\nthe severe drought of last summer did not dry, nor the heat raise to a\r\ntemperature of 60°.\r\n\r\nWe are assured most positively that none of the spring water finds its\r\nway over the mouth of the can into the milk. Its dilution, of which\r\nthere is so much just complaint, must be done, if at all, in the city,\r\nfor the wholesale buyer is said to have such means of testing the milk\r\nas effectually protects him against the farmer. May the man be busy at\r\nwork who is to give each family such a protection. We have heard it said\r\nthat one end of a small piece of common tape placed in a pan of milk\r\nwill carry from it all the water into another vessel in which the other\r\nend of the tape should be placed; but we have never found this a safe\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, no butter is made on these large milk farms. The supply\r\nfor the family is obtained from market, or, more rarely, from a neighbor\r\nwho churns all his milk for the accommodation of those who send all\r\ntheirs to the city. Our notions of the way to make butter were decidedly\r\noverturned on going to such a dairy. No setting of the milk in shallow\r\npans for cream to rise; no skimming and putting away in jars until\r\n\"churning day,\" when the thick cream was agitated by a strong arm until\r\nthe butter came, then worked and salted. Instead, there is a daily\r\npouring of the unskimmed soured milk into a common churn, perhaps\r\nsomewhat larger than ordinary. The dasher is fastened to a shaft, which\r\nis moved by a crank. The crank is turned by means of a nearly horizontal\r\nwheel some eight or ten feet in diameter, which is kept in motion by a\r\ndog, sheep, or calf standing on it, something after the manner of the\r\nold tread-mill.\r\n\r\nWhen taken from the churn, the butter is worked by hand as of old. The\r\nfarmer with whom we have talked said he was about determined to send his\r\nmilk to the creamery, since butter-making made it so hard for the women.\r\nSurely woman is less a drudge than she used to be. If, after being\r\nrelieved from the labor of churning, the remaining working of the butter\r\nis considered too hard for the farmer's wife, the day of a woman's\r\nredemption must be near at hand.\r\n\r\nOnly one butter farm, have we been able to find, and not enough is made\r\nthere to supply the immediate neighborhood. Where, then, does all the\r\nOrange county butter come from? Mostly from the West. Farmers buy\r\nfrom the vicinity of the Alleghenies, and even further west, large\r\nquantities, which they sell in the original packages or repack in pails.\r\nSince railroads have become so numerous, New York drinks up all the milk\r\nin Orange county, and must butter her bread elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe largest institution for the disposition of milk is the Creamery,\r\nwhich is, in other words, a cheese factory. Here is brought the milk\r\nwhich the farmers themselves are unable properly to prepare for market,\r\nfor want of cool springs or sufficient help. Received here, it is placed\r\nin deep but narrow tin pails holding twelve or fourteen quartz. These\r\nare floated in large tanks of water. From these pails the cream is\r\ncarefully taken and sent to market. The skimmed milk is then placed in\r\na large vat and heated, by means of steam pipes to about 80°. Then the\r\nrennet is put in. From twenty to thirty minutes suffices for curdling,\r\nand the mass is then stirred to separate the curd from the whey. After\r\nwhich it is heated still more; and then the whey, passing off through a\r\nstrainer, goes to feed hogs, while the curd remains in the vat, to be\r\nsalted and worked before putting into the presses. In two or three hours\r\nthe curds become hard enough for the canvas to be put upon them ready\r\nfor the shelves. Very carefully they must then be watched, lest the\r\nfly lying in wait for them makes in them a snug house for her family.\r\nGreasing and turning must be a daily labor, and some weeks must pass\r\nbefore they are sufficiently cured for market.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of city consumers, who are paying ten and twelve cents a\r\nquart for milk, from a tenth to a quarter of which is not infrequently\r\npure Croton, we may add that the highest price the farmer ever gets for\r\nhis milk is seven cents a quart; and he sometimes sells it for as low as\r\ntwo cents and a half. Our friends, the milkmen, have, therefore, it will\r\nbe seen, a pretty good margin for freight and profit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Hay Elevator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method most generally used for elevating hay is evidently not\r\nthe most economical application of the power of horses for the\r\naccomplishment of the purpose desired. The tackle involves a great deal\r\nof friction, and as the quantity which can be thus raised at once is,\r\nprobably, on the average, not more than from 150 to 200 lbs, much more\r\ntime is employed in re-adjusting the fork, than would be the case if a\r\nlarger quantity were elevated.\r\n\r\nThe invention under consideration supplies a means whereby it is claimed\r\nhay may be unloaded with far greater facility than heretofore, with less\r\nlabor to the team and with fewer hands than are at present employed.\r\n\r\nA primary gear wheel is propelled horizontally by a lever worked by\r\na horse. The primary gear impels a pinion keyed to the shaft of a\r\nwindlass, upon which is wound the elevating rope, whenever the clutch,\r\nA, is made to operate through the cord and lever, B. This cord runs over\r\na pulley on the under side the wood framework at C, and its further end\r\nmay be held in the hand of the workman on the hay load, who, when he has\r\nproperly adjusted the fork, pulls the cord which operates the clutch,\r\nand the \"fork-full\" of hay is at once elevated. The cylinder of the\r\nwindlass, not being keyed to the shaft, only operates when the clutch is\r\nclosed by the cord.\r\n\r\nThe horse, or horses which furnish power to the machine, may, therefore,\r\nkeep on traveling in the same direction, and no time is lost in stopping\r\nand backing, as in the method in general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DERR'S CAPSTSTAN FOR ELEVATING HAY FORKS.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that this is a cheap, durable, and desirable\r\nmachine, and one that can be used to great advantage, not only for the\r\nelevation of hay, but for many other purposes. We think it would be\r\nfound a decided improvement in discharging cargoes of coal from barges,\r\nand for handling coal in storage yards.\r\n\r\nThe inventor claims that twice as much hay can be raised in a given time\r\nby its use, as can be done by the old method; and it dispenses with one\r\nhand at the barn or stack.\r\n\r\nA coupling at D, enables attachments to be made, which extend the\r\nusefulness of the machine very much. It may be used as a power for\r\ndriving wood saws, cutting fuel, thrashing, and other work where a\r\nsimple horse power is desirable.\r\n\r\nAddress for further information, Wm.

The\r\nwick, two forms of which are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, are made of\r\nglass, and are filled preferably with pulverized gypsum, although any\r\nfinely-ground stone, mineral, or metal may be employed. The bottom of\r\nthe glass tube is closed by wire gauze, or other suitable strainer,\r\nthrough which the fluid flows; and is carried by the capillary\r\nattraction of the pounded material to the top of the wick.\r\n\r\nThus a permanent wick is obtained, which may be employed with any form\r\nof lamp, and will last for an indefinite time. It may also be used in\r\nconnection with an open cup, which the inventor terms a poor man's\r\nlamp. A perforated card is laid upon the top of the cup or tumbler as a\r\nsupport to the wick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt may be used either with or without a chimney, and it is claimed that\r\nwith good kerosene oil it is perfectly safe, and consumes less of it,\r\nwhile it may be also used as a candle.\r\n\r\nPatented through the Scientific American Patent Agency, September 14,\r\n1869, by Edward D.

It is the canal which has\r\nraised up the numerous handsome villas and fine gardens. Fresh water is\r\nall that is needed to turn the arid desert into a fruitful soil; and the\r\nsupply of this is provided by the subsidary canal which the company\r\nhas formed side by side with that broad salt one which now unites two\r\nworlds. Wonderful stories are told of the productiveness of the gardens,\r\nand a walk through any of those belonging to the leading officials\r\nstationed at Ismailla is to verify them all. Vines with large bunches of\r\ngrapes pendent from their branches; orange trees with green fruit just\r\nshowing a golden tint; ivy, roses, geraniums from England, and an\r\nendless variety of rich tropical plants are all flourishing. In the\r\ncentre of the town is a square with trees and a building clothed with\r\nrich creepers in its midst. Everything here looks French. A handsome\r\nboulevard runs down to the point of embarkation, the streets and squares\r\nare on the true Parisian model, and there are _cafes_, billiard rooms,\r\nand _cafe chantants_ which might easily belong to Nantes or Lyons. There\r\nare of course huge gaps where the houses and shops will be; the roads\r\nare, many of them, still of sand; camels draw carts, and generally\r\npervade the place in long strings; but with all this you are kept in a\r\nstate of wonder during your stay at Ismailla at the marvelous conversion\r\nwhich has taken, place under your eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerican agricultural implements are highly praised in newspaper reports\r\nof the Metropolitan Cattle Show, held recently in London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoore's Rural New Yorker\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Dec. 25 contains a splendid full page Engraving of the PRIZE FOWLS\r\nat the recent State Poultry Show--the Best Poultry Picture ever given in\r\nan American newspaper.--Also, a magnificent CHRISTMAS PICTURE, and other\r\nfine Illustrations.

If you can not get pure silver, you may purify it by\r\ndissolving coin in nitric acid, filtering the solution and precipitating\r\nthe silver in the form of a chloride by hydrochloric acid. Next wash the\r\nprecipitate with hot water until the washings cease to redden litmus\r\npaper. Next mix the pure chloride of silver while yet moist with its own\r\nweight of pure crystallized carbonate of soda, place the mixture in a\r\ncovered porcelain crucible and heat very gradually until the fusing\r\npoint of silver is reached. The reduced silver will be pure and may be\r\nremoved by breaking the crucible. Wash the button thoroughly with hot\r\nwater to remove the flux. In dissolving the pure silver thus obtained in\r\nnitric acid, it is better to use an excess of acid; the excess will be\r\ndriven off by heat in evaporation.\r\n\r\nG.B., of Iowa.--Nominal horse power is merely a conventional expression\r\nfor diameter of cylinder and length of stroke, and does not apply to the\r\nactual power of the engine. It is found by multiplying the cube root of\r\nthe stroke in feet by the square of the diameter in inches and dividing\r\nthe product by 47. This rule is based upon the postulate established by\r\nWatt, that the speed of a piston with two feet stroke is 160 feet per\r\nminute, and that for longer strokes the speed varies as the cube roots\r\nof the length of the stroke. It is needless to say this rule is not\r\nobserved in modern practice, yet the expression, nominal horse power, is\r\nlike many other relics of past time still retained. The above rule does\r\nnot apply to high pressure engines. For such engines Bourne has given\r\nthe following rule: Multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder\r\nin inches by the cube root of the stroke in feet, and divide by 15.6.\r\nThe real power of an engine is estimated from the mean effective\r\npressure in the cylinder--not the boiler--and the speed of the piston.\r\nYour data are insufficient to determine the horse power of your boiler.\r\nThe horse power of boilers is estimated from the extent of heating\r\nsurface when the grate and all other things are correctly proportioned,\r\nbut with them as with engines, only actual test will positively\r\ndetermine it. The pipe you mention ought to be enlarged as proposed.\r\n\r\nW.H.R., of Mass.--Pressure acts independently of the mode of\r\napplication. A tun laid upon the head of a wedge would produce the same\r\neffect as though it were applied through toggles. When, however, a\r\nweight is dropped its effect increases as the square of its velocity.\r\n\r\nJ.B., of N.Y.--We recommend you to get \"Appleton's Dictionary of\r\nMechanics.\" Also send for descriptive catalogue to Henry Carey Baird,\r\nPhiladelphia, from which you will be able to judge for yourself what\r\nworks are suited to your requirements.\r\n\r\nT.D.H., of Mass.--Ammonia, in a weak solution, may be used to cleanse\r\nthe scalp, but is not recommended for the purpose. Borax in solution is\r\nbetter. The supposed preservation of the color of the hair by its use is\r\na mistake.\r\n\r\nF.B.H., of Ill.--So far as we know, nothing better than the flax seed\r\nbag has been discovered for packing the lower end of tubes in artesian\r\nwells. We have never heard of any trouble arising from the method and\r\nthink you will have none.\r\n\r\nL.G. of Mass.--Express the decimal ratio of the diameter of a circle to\r\nthe circumference to which you refer, as a mixed vulgar fraction, and\r\nyou will have what you ask for, if we understand your query.\r\n\r\nA.H.S., of Sandwich Islands.--We know of no substance that in our\r\nopinion, could be used advantageously to paint the interior of\r\nsheet-iron evaporating pans for concentrating cane juice.\r\n\r\nL.B., of Wis.--We would be glad to assist you but the data you furnish\r\nare not sufficient.

Having decided upon the\r\nlength of the lever, the distance of the valve stem from the fulcrum,\r\nand the point from which the weight will be suspended, the weight\r\nnecessary will be found by multiplying the area of the valve port in\r\ninches into the pressure per square inch in the boiler in pounds, and\r\nthis product into the distance of the center of the valve stem from\r\nthe fulcrum in inches, and dividing the product thus obtained by the\r\ndistance from the fulcrum to the point of suspension of the weight in\r\ninches. The quotient will give the weight in pounds.\r\n\r\nA.K.S., of Ohio.--The inclination of the poles of a planet to the plane\r\nof its orbit, determines its zones and also its seasons. The inclination\r\nof the earth's axis is twenty-three and one half degrees. This places\r\nthe tropics the same distance each side of the equator, and the polar\r\ncircles the same distance from the poles. The torrid zone is therefore\r\nforty-seven degrees wide, and the temperate zones each forty-three\r\ndegrees wide. As the planets vary in their inclination of their axis\r\nto the planes of their orbits, it follows that their zones and seasons\r\ndiffer from those of the earth.\r\n\r\nW.H.C., of Texas.--The teeth of a circular wood saw to be driven by\r\nfoot-power, should be not larger than those of the ordinary hand\r\ncrosscut. The fly-wheel ought to have a rim weighing from eighty to one\r\nhundred pounds, and it should be, for a 12-inch saw, not less than a\r\nfoot in diameter. It should be placed on the saw arbor. The belt should\r\nnot run on the fly-wheel, but on a special pulley, and the treadle and\r\ncrank motion should be so adjusted that the foot will move through an\r\narc of from 10 to 12 inches.\r\n\r\nA.H.B., of Pa.--We advise you to use a battery in coating the small\r\ngray castings, of which you write, with copper. It will be all the more\r\nsatisfactory in the end.

By Nelson Row, Publisher,\r\nNo 149 Fulton street, New York.\r\n\r\nThis little work, which our readers will find advertised in another\r\ncolumn, must prove an almost indispensable help in the counting rooms of\r\nestablishments employing large numbers of workmen at varying rates of\r\nwages. It is one of the best things of the kind we have ever seen, and\r\nwe give it earnest commendation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR COOKING. By Miss Leslie. Price, by mail, $1.50.\r\n\r\nHenry Carey Baird, of Philadelphia, has just published a new edition of\r\nMiss Leslie's \"Old Standard and Renowned Cookery,\" being the sixtieth\r\nedition of a book which has stood the test of time and practice, and is\r\na valuable aid in every household.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNY.\r\n\r\nS.R. Wells, of this city, has published in pretty form \"Benny,\" a\r\nChristmas ballad, by Annie Chambers Ketchum, a poem which has already\r\nappeared in the _Phrenological Journal_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prospectus of EVERY SATURDAY, for 1870, by Fields, Osgood & Co. of\r\nBoston, promises to give us that excellent journal in a new and enlarged\r\nform, with the additional attraction of illustrations, engraved from\r\ndesigns by leading European artists. This publication will therefore\r\nhereafter present weekly, not only the cream of European literature, but\r\nthe cream of European art. The high character of the publishers of this\r\njournal is an ample guarantee that this promise will be fulfilled in the\r\nmost satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIPPINCOTT'S MAGAZINE, for January, also presents a varied and select\r\nbill of fare, containing among other things, Part XIII. of Robert\r\nDale Owen's novel \"Beyond the Breakers,\" \"The Fairy and the Ghost,\"\r\na Christmas tale, with six amusing illustrations; a curious and\r\ninteresting article on \"Literary Lunatics,\" by Wirt Sikes, \"Our\r\nCapital,\" by William R. Hooper, and very much more excellent matter in\r\nthe way of stories poems, and essays.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Mobile Weekly Register,\" the oldest Democratic paper in the South,\r\nis said to have reached a larger circulation than was ever attained by\r\nany journal South of Mason and Dixon's line. It is full of interesting\r\nvaried matter, having an able agricultural department, presided over by\r\nthe veteran editor and successful agriculturist, Hon. C.C. Langdon. Its\r\ngeneral literature, poetry, stories, etc., make it highly acceptable\r\nto the ladies. The year will open with a new continued story, of deep\r\ninterest, by one of the most distinguished writers of the day. The price\r\nwas recently reduced to $3.00 per year, which, for so large a paper (12\r\npages), is extremely cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have received the January number of \"Demorest's Mirror of Fashions,\"\r\na work that interests the ladies. Also \"Demorest's Young America,\" a\r\nfine magazine for boys and girls. Both these serials are well published\r\nby Mr. and Madame Demorest of this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. Patent Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Obtain Letters Patent for New Inventions.\r\n\r\nInformation about Caveats, Extensions, Interferences Designs, Trade\r\nMarks; also, Foreign Patents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a period of nearly twenty-five years, MUNN & CO. have occupied the\r\nposition of leading Solicitors of American and European Patents, and\r\nduring this extended experience of nearly a quarter of a century, they\r\nhave examined not less than fifty thousand alleged new inventions, and\r\nhave prosecuted upward of thirty thousand applications for patents, and,\r\nin addition to this, they have made, at the Patent Office, over twenty\r\nthousand preliminary examinations into the novelty of inventions, with a\r\ncareful report on the same.\r\n\r\nThe important advantages of MUNN & CO.'S Agency are, that their practice\r\nhas been ten-fold greater than that of any other Agency in existence,\r\nwith the additional advantage of having the assistance of the best\r\nprofessional skill in every department, and a Branch Office at\r\nWashington, which watches and supervises, when necessary, cases as they\r\npass through official examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSULTATIONS AND OPINIONS FREE.\r\n\r\nThose who have made inventions and desire a consultation are cordially\r\ninvited to advise with MUNN & CO. who will be happy to see them in\r\nperson at the office, or to advise them by letter. In all cases, they\r\nmay expect an HONEST OPINION. For such consultations, opinion, and\r\nadvice, NO CHARGE is made. A pen-and-ink sketch and a description of the\r\ninvention should be sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO APPLY FOR A PATENT,\r\n\r\na model must be furnished, not over a foot in any dimension. Send model\r\nto MUNN & CO., 37 Park Row, New York, by express, charges paid, also, a\r\ndescription of the improvement, and remit $16 to cover first Government\r\nfee, and revenue and postage stamps.\r\n\r\nThe model should be neatly made, of any suitable materials, strongly\r\nfastened, without glue, and neatly painted. The name of the inventor\r\nshould be engraved or painted upon it. When the invention consists of an\r\nimprovement upon some other machine, a full working model of the whole\r\nmachine will not be necessary. But the model must be sufficiently\r\nperfect to show with clearness the nature and operation of the\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nis made into the patentability of an invention by personal search at the\r\nPatent Office, among the models of the patents pertaining to the class\r\nto which the improvement relates. For this special search, and a report\r\nin writing, a fee of $5 is charged. This search is made by a corps of\r\nexaminer of long experience.\r\n\r\nInventors who employ us are not required to incur the cost of a\r\npreliminary examination. But it is advised in doubtful cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen the model is received, and first Government fee paid, the drawings\r\nand specification are carefully prepared and forwarded to the applicant\r\nfor his signature and oath, at which time the agency fee is called for.\r\nThis fee is generally not over $25. The cases are exceptionally complex\r\nif a higher fee than $25 is called for, and, upon the return of\r\nthe papers, they are filed at the Patent Office to await Official\r\nexamination. If the case should be rejected for any cause, or objections\r\nmade to a claim, the reasons are inquired into and communicated to the\r\napplicant, with sketches and explanations of the references; and should\r\nit appear that the reasons given are insufficient, the claims are\r\nprosecuted immediately, and the rejection set aside, and usually WITHOUT\r\nEXTRA CHARGE TO THE APPLICANT.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. are determined to place within the reach of those who confide\r\nto them their business, the best facilities and the highest professional\r\nskill and experience.\r\n\r\nThe only cases of this character, in which MUNN & CO. expect an extra\r\nfee, are those wherein appeals are taken from the decision of the\r\nExaminer after a second rejection; and MUNN & CO. wish to state very\r\ndistinctly, that they have but few cases which can not be settled\r\nwithout the necessity of an appeal; and before an appeal is taken, in\r\nany case, the applicant is fully advised of all facts and charges, and\r\nno proceedings are had without his sanction; so that all inventors who\r\nemploy MUNN & CO. know in advance what their applications and patents\r\nare to cost.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. make no charge for prosecuting the rejected claims of their\r\nown clients before the Examiners and when their patents are granted, the\r\ninvention is noticed editorially in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nREJECTED CASES.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. give very special attention to the examination and\r\nprosecution of rejected cases filed by inventors and other attorneys. In\r\nsuch cases a fee of $5 is required for special examination and report,\r\nand in case of probable success by further prosecution, and the papers\r\nare found tolerably well prepared, MUNN & Co. will take up the case and\r\nendeavor to get it through for a reasonable fee, to be agreed upon in\r\nadvance of prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVEATS\r\n\r\nAre desirable if an inventor is not fully prepared to apply for a\r\nPatent. A Caveat affords protection, for one year, against the issue\r\nof a patent to another for the same invention. Caveat papers should be\r\ncarefully prepared. The Government fee on filing a Caveat is $10, and\r\nMUNN & Co.'s charges for preparing the necessary papers are usually from\r\n$10 to $12.\r\n\r\n\r\nREISSUES.\r\n\r\nA patent when discovered to be defective, may be reissued by the\r\nsurrender of the original patent, and the filing of amended papers. This\r\nproceeding should be taken with great care.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGNS, TRADE MARKS, AND COMPOSITIONS\r\n\r\ncan be patented for a term of years, also, new medicines or medical\r\ncompounds, and useful mixtures of all kinds. When the invention consists\r\nof a medicine or compound, or a new article of manufacture, or a new\r\ncomposition, samples of the article must be furnished, neatly put up.\r\nAlso, send a full statement of the ingredients, proportions, mode of\r\npreparation, uses, and merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENTS CAN BE EXTENDED.\r\n\r\nAll patents issued prior to 1861, and now in force, may be extended for\r\na period of seven years upon the presentation of proper testimony. The\r\nextended term of a patent is frequently of much greater value than the\r\nfirst term; but an application for an extension, to be successful,\r\nmust be carefully prepared. MUNN & Co. have had a large experience in\r\nobtaining extensions, and are prepared to give reliable advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERFERENCES\r\n\r\nBetween pending applications before the Commissioners are managed and\r\ntestimony taken; also, Assignments, Agreements, and Licenses prepared.\r\nIn fact, there is no branch of the Patent Business which MUNN & Co. are\r\nnot fully prepared to undertake and manage with fidelity and dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN PATENTS.\r\n\r\nAmerican inventors should bear in mind that five Patents--American,\r\nEnglish, French, Belgian, and Prussian--will secure an inventor\r\nexclusive monopoly to his discovery among ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY\r\nMILLIONS of the most intelligent people in the world. The facilities of\r\nbusiness and steam communication are such, that patents can be obtained\r\nabroad by our citizens almost as easily as at home. MUNN & Co. have\r\nprepared and taken a larger number of European Patents than any other\r\nAmerican Agency. They have Agents of great experience in London, Paris,\r\nBerlin, and other Capitals.\r\n\r\nA Pamphlet, containing a synopsis of the Foreign Patent Laws, sent free.\r\nAddress\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO., 37 Park Row, New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial List of Patents.\r\n\r\nIssued by the United States Patent Office\r\n\r\nFOR THE WEEK ENDING DEC. 14, 1869.\r\n\r\n_Reported Officially for the Scientific American_\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE OF PATENT OFFICE FEES:\r\n\r\n  On each caveat                                                $10\r\n  On filing each application for a Patent (seventeen years)     $15\r\n  On issuing each original Patent                               $20\r\n  On appeal to Commissioner of Patents                          $20\r\n  On application for Reissue                                    $30\r\n  On application for Extension of Patent                        $50\r\n  On granting the Extension                                     $50\r\n  On filing a Disclaimer                                        $10\r\n  On an application for Design (three and a half years)         $10\r\n  On an application for Design (seven years)                    $15\r\n  On an application for Design (fourteen years)                 $30\r\n\r\nIn addition to which there are some small revenue-stamp taxes.

Scrap Bar, worked double turn. Day turn started at 3\r\nA.M., and was done by 1 P.M. Night turn went on at 2 P.M., and was done\r\nby 11 P.M., worked 5 heats to each turn. Consumed 350 bushels of coal.\r\nFurnace was lighted on Sunday out of coal. The Stevenson Furnace, from\r\n15th to 20th April, produced 29,160 lbs. of Muck Bar, and 515 lbs. of\r\nScrap Bar, worked double turn. Day turn started at 3 A.M., and was done\r\nby 10 A.M. Night turn started at 11 A.M., and was done by 6 P.M., worked\r\n6 heats to each turn. Consumed 300 bushels of coal. Furnace was lighted\r\non Sunday out of coal. The same weight of heats of Pig and Scrap were\r\nweighed to each Furnace. On Stevenson Furnace, 3,963 lbs. more Muck Bar,\r\nand 220 lbs. more Scrap Bar were made, with 50 bushels less coal than\r\nwere used in other furnace. The saving in ore (fix) in former over\r\nlatter during the week, was 450 lbs., by actual weight. A very important\r\nfeature is the great saving accomplished in brick and brick-laying. The\r\nfirst Stevenson Furnace, put up three months, has not had any repair\r\nput upon it, and is, to-day, in good working order, while the ordinary\r\nfurnaces are generally repaired about every two weeks. The cost, over\r\nordinary furnace, is about seventy dollars.\r\n\r\nWe cheerfully bear witness to the truth of the above statements of Mr.\r\nStevenson. They are rather under than over the mark. The quality of iron\r\nmade in his furnaces is the same as made by ordinary kind. We think it a\r\nvaluable improvement, and intend to introduce it as fast as possible in\r\nour forge. J.
