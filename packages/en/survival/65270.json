I                        APRIL, 1905                         NO. 1\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE OLD SOUTH.\r\n\r\n                          By Robert L. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant civilizations that ever flourished in the\r\nhistory of the world staggered and fell with broken sword and shattered\r\nshield on that dark day when the flag of Southern hope and glory went\r\ndown in blood and tears. Its decimated armies, too exhausted from loss\r\nof blood to longer pull the trigger, too weak from starvation to charge\r\nthe enemy, too footsore and too proud to run, stacked their old, bent\r\nand battered muskets in the anguish of defeat and went limping back to\r\ntheir ruined homes in Dixie.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing left of that civilization now but a few remnants of its\r\ngray columns—_themselves_ grown gray as if in honor of the uniforms they\r\nwore—and the thrilling and pathetic story of its vanished prestige and\r\npower lingering among its tombstones and monuments like the fragrance of\r\nroses that are faded and gone. Never again will the white-columned\r\nmansions of the masters glorify the groves of live oak and the orange\r\nand the palm where Southern beauty was wooed and won by Southern\r\nchivalry, and life was an endless chain of pleasure. Never again will\r\nthe snowy cotton fields and rice fields, stretching away to the Gulf or\r\nto the river, teem with happy slaves and ring with their old time\r\nplantation melodies. Hushed forever is the music of the Old South!\r\nClosed are the lips of its matchless orators! The dust of its statesmen\r\nmingles with the dust of the heroes who died to save it. Only three are\r\nleft in the counsels of the nation: Morgan, the brave and the true, the\r\nable, the eloquent and learned Senator from Alabama; Pettus from the\r\nsame state, the peer of Morgan in all the exalted traits of character\r\nthat distinguish the unswerving and incorruptible representative and\r\ndefender of Southern ideals and Southern traditions; and Bate, that\r\ngrand old man of dauntless courage, that fearless soldier with many\r\nscars, the hero of Shiloh, the strong and faithful Senator who in\r\nprivate life is as pure and gentle as the mother of his children, and in\r\nwar as bold and daring a cavalier as ever drew a sword![1] It is true\r\nthere are other splendid men from the land of cotton and cane in\r\nCongress, whose heads are silvered o’er, and who have nobly led Southern\r\nthought and sentiment. They are superb exponents of the old ante-bellum\r\ncivilization, but they were too young to taste the sweets of its glory.\r\nSome of them were born soon enough to listen to the lullaby of the old\r\nblack mammy and to sit in the negro cabin and listen to the\r\nblood-curdling tales of uncle ’Rastus about ghosts and goblins; some,\r\nlike Daniel of Virginia, Berry of Arkansas, and Blackburn of Kentucky,\r\nwere old enough to follow Lee and Jackson and to fight to the finish;\r\nbut their youth forbade them from sitting on the throne of living ebony\r\nwith these older men, who, in reality, are all that is left of the Old\r\nSouth in the national legislature; and in whose presence all men,\r\nwhether of the North or of the South, delight to lift their hats with\r\nthat profound reverence which true nobility of character always\r\ncommands. What a shame there are not four!\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Senator Bate has died since this was penned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SENATOR WILLIAM B. BATE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR JAMES B. FRAZIER, OF TENNESSEE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA sigh of deep regret came from the Southern heart when Missouri\r\nregistered the decree that Cockrell, the soul of honor, the\r\nimpersonation of truth and integrity, the soldier and the statesman,\r\nmust cease to reflect honor upon that great commonwealth as one of its\r\nrepresentatives in the United States Senate. But it must be a sweet\r\nconsolation to him to go back among the people whom he has served so\r\nfaithfully and so well, with the consciousness of a clean life behind\r\nhim, both private and public, and with the prestige of a glorious record\r\nin the service of his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR JOHN C. W. BECKHAM, OF KENTUCKY\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo those who have marked the passing of men in recent years, how solemn\r\nthe thought that there are so few left to tell the tale of the manhood,\r\nthe wealth and the influence of that chivalrous race who staked all and\r\nlost all save honor in the struggle to preserve its institutions. There\r\nis only one remaining who served in the cabinet of Jefferson Davis, in\r\nthe person of the venerable and beloved John H. Reagan of the Lone Star\r\nState. The dews of life’s evening are condensing on his brow and its\r\nshadows are lengthening around him, but the burden of his fourscore\r\nyears and five still rests lightly upon him. The snows that never melt\r\nhave fallen upon his head, but there’s no snow upon his heart; ’tis\r\nalways summer there! He has been distinguished through life for his\r\nrigid honesty and the fearless discharge of duty, and he will die, as he\r\nhas lived, the idol of his people. May God lengthen the twilight of his\r\ndeclining years far into the twentieth century![2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Since this article was set up, Judge Reagan, too, has passed away.\r\n\r\nOne by one the great majority of the star actors in the thrilling drama\r\nof the past have made their exit behind the sable curtain of death, and\r\nin all probability another decade will clear the stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR ANDREW J.

TERRELL, OF GEORGIA.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the purposes of this magazine to aid in keeping ever fresh\r\nand green the history and traditions of the Old South; to keep alive its\r\nchivalrous spirit, and to tell the pathetic story of the lion-hearted\r\nmen around whose names are woven some of the greatest events of history.\r\nIt has been beautifully said that “literature loves a lost cause.” If\r\nthis be true, the South will yet be a flower garden of the most\r\nenchanting literature that ever blossomed in any age or in any land.\r\nSome Homer will rise, greater than the Greek, and dream among the\r\ncemeteries where its heroes sleep and sing the sweetest Iliad ever sung!\r\nThe spirit of another Hugo will brood over its battle fields and gather\r\ntales of valor and reckless courage; of grim visaged men scorning shot\r\nand shell and riding to the cannon’s mouth; of bayonets mixed and\r\ncrossed; of angry armies clinching and rolling together in the bloody\r\nmire of the awful strife; of Death on the pale horse, beckoning the\r\nflower of the Old South to the opening grave! He will gather up the\r\ntears and prayers and the withered hopes of a dying nation; the piteous\r\nwails of pale and haggard maidens for lovers slain in battle; the\r\nshrieks of brides for grooms of a day brought back with pallid lips\r\nsealed forever and jackets all stained with blood; and the swoons of\r\nmothers with the kisses of fallen sons still warm upon their wrinkled\r\nbrows. He will gather them up and weave them all into volumes of\r\nromantic love more vivid and terrible than the story of Waterloo! He\r\nwill paint in burning words a picture, not of all the horrors that\r\nfollowed the blunder of Grouchy in that battle upon which hung the fate\r\nof empires, but of Stonewall Jackson falling in the noontide of his\r\nbrilliant career and passing over the river to rest under the shade of\r\nthe trees; a picture, not of Wellington seizing the fallen Napoleon and\r\nbanishing him to solitude and death on a rock in the sea, but of the\r\ngreat and generous Grant receiving our own immortal Lee like a king at\r\nAppomattox, declining to accept his sword and bidding him return to the\r\npeaceful walks of private life among the green hills of old Virginia; a\r\npicture, not of Ney, who had fought so long and so bravely for the\r\ntriumph of his beloved France, shot through the heart by cowards within\r\nthe very walls of Paris, but of Gordon, with golden tongue portraying\r\nthe last days of the Confederacy amid the shouts and tears of the brave\r\nmen who had faced him with booming cannon and rattling musketry on a\r\nhundred fields of glory; a picture, not of the English Channel as the\r\ndividing line between the drawn swords of France and Britain, but of\r\nMason and Dixon’s line healing into a red scar of honor across the\r\nbreast of the great Republic and marking the unity of a once divided\r\ncountry!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR NEWTON C. BLANCHARD, OF LOUISIANA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR N. B. BROWARD, OF FLORIDA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNOR JAMES K. VARDEMAN, OF MISSISSIPPI.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SENATOR JOHN T. MORGAN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot very long ago, during the Spanish-American War, there was commotion\r\nin a far Southern town, caused by a coterie of young men bitterly\r\nprotesting against the sons of Confederate veterans wearing the blue and\r\nfighting under the old flag. An elderly man with “crow’s feet” at the\r\ncomers of his eyes and silver in his hair, listened for a while in\r\nsilence, but finally arose from his chair and said: “Young men, you are\r\nwrong. I followed the stars and bars for four long, weary years! I saw\r\nits colors go down at last and I straggled back to my native state,\r\nbarefooted and in rags, only to find my home in ashes. I swore eternal\r\nenmity to the stars and stripes and to the blue. But one day, after the\r\nbattle of Manila Bay had been fought, a Mississippi regiment went\r\nmarching up the main street of my town and lo! my boy was in the ranks\r\ndressed in the Federal uniform. In my rage I rushed to the Colonel and\r\nshouted, “Take that blue uniform off these young men and let them put on\r\nthe gray and show the world how the sons of Confederate veterans can\r\nfight!” but the Colonel smiled and shook his head and the regiment\r\nmarched on eager for the fray. I went home in my fury more bitter\r\nagainst the North than ever before. But when one day they brought my boy\r\nhome in his coffin and I looked down upon him pale and motionless, in\r\nhis blue uniform and wrapped in the old flag, my animosity vanished in a\r\nmoment and in my tears I said: ‘Henceforth that uniform is my uniform,\r\nthat flag is my flag and this whole country is my country.’” This\r\nsentiment is not incompatible with loyalty to the gray nor to the folded\r\nstars and bars, but it is the expression of the only feeling that will\r\never unite all the sections of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SENATOR B. F. PETTUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe must recognize the fact that a new civilization has arisen in the\r\nSouth from the ashes of the old, and while her people cherish the past\r\nfor its precious memories, their faces are turned toward the morning.\r\nThey are not only producing more cotton than ever before, but building\r\ngigantic plants among its snow-white fields, and with the magic of\r\nmodern machinery are transforming the raw material into finished\r\nfabrics; they are pulling down the hills and dragging forth their\r\ntreasures of coal and iron, of marble, zinc and lead, and are converting\r\nthem into all the finished implements of peace; they are harnessing\r\ntheir beautiful rivers to the thunder-clad steeds of the storm and\r\nturning the myriad wheels of industry with electric power; and they will\r\nsome day out-herod Herod in the marts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe representatives and governors of the South, confronted with new and\r\nperilous problems, have had the courage to grapple with them, the brain\r\nto control them and the heart to turn many of them into blessings. They\r\nhave brought wealth out of poverty and prosperity out of desolation; and\r\nHope stands on the horizon with a new crown in her hand, beckoning this\r\nnew civilization to a throne of power never dreamed of by the old. And\r\nyet, while the Southern people rejoice in the resurrection of their\r\ncountry from the dead and in the bright prospects spread out before\r\nthem, let them never forget to worship at the shrine of memory nor to\r\npermit the glory of the blessed past to be dimmed by the splendor of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    POPULAR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n                       By Henry N. Snyder, LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY NELSON SNYDER, M.A., LITT.D., LL.D.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  President Henry N. Snyder, of Wofford College, speaks to our readers\r\n  in a thoughtful and commanding way on a question, that with the rapid\r\n  and general development of the South is becoming more and more\r\n  recognized as a vital popular problem.\r\n\r\n  As the executive head of one of the South’s most representative\r\n  denominational colleges and as a lecturer on the subject before\r\n  representative summer schools for teachers, President Snyder has had\r\n  occasion to bestow upon his theme serious and special study and his\r\n  intelligent and earnest treatment of his topic tends to present it in\r\n  a practical and popular form and to eliminate from it those\r\n  speculative and academic qualities that have so generally\r\n  characterized its discussion.\r\n\r\n  A native of Macon, Ga., where he was born during the final year of the\r\n  Civil War, President Snyder was reared and educated in Nashville\r\n  where, after completing the course of the city high schools he entered\r\n  Vanderbilt University in 1883, and from which he graduated in arts,\r\n  with both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees.\r\n\r\n  He was until 1890 connected with his alma mater, the last three years\r\n  of which time he was instructor in Latin and student of graduate\r\n  subjects. He subsequently pursued advanced special work in German and\r\n  English universities, since which time, until 1902, he was professor\r\n  of the English Language and Literature in Wofford College. He has been\r\n  president of this institution since 1902.\r\n\r\n  President Snyder’s contribution to the actual promotion and solution\r\n  of his subject has been considerable, as he has served as lecturer on\r\n  English Literature at the South Carolina State Summer School and the\r\n  Summer School of the South, at Knoxville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n  He is a frequent contributor to magazines on literary and educational\r\n  subjects and is a member of the Modern Language Association of\r\n  America, and the Religious Education Association.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy is not so much an achievement as a prophecy. Its\r\nchief glory cannot be in what it is, but in what it is to be. It has not\r\nattained the measure of its growth till every man in it has a fair\r\nchance and an open field to make the most of himself, and has done so\r\nwith reasonable completeness. It is therefore essentially idealistic,\r\nand, however deeply concerned with the present hour’s duty and work, its\r\nface is ever set toward a larger future for itself. But this larger\r\nfuture can only be realized in a finer and more efficient quality of the\r\nmen and women who are to do the work and continue the unfolding life of\r\nthis free democracy of equal opportunity,—equal opportunity not for the\r\nfew favored by fortune or circumstance, but for every child born in it.\r\nNo democracy dare have any other mind with reference to itself.\r\n\r\nThe most necessary, as the most inspiring, work therefore which a\r\ndemocracy assumes to do is that of seeing to it that all its children\r\nare rightly trained for intelligent service and skilled efficiency. This\r\ntask it undertakes not only that it may live as a collective body but\r\nalso that each citizen may in the best and fullest manner express his\r\nown individual life. In this two-fold view of the matter popular\r\neducation, the putting of all the children of all the people into the\r\nbest possible schools, under the best possible teachers, for the longest\r\npossible time, becomes the sacred and imperative duty of a democracy\r\nthat cares for to-morrow as well as for to-day. And the to-morrow of a\r\ndemocracy, in all the manifold activities of its complex life, is\r\ndetermined by what it does for the child of to-day.\r\n\r\nFrom this viewpoint no democracy ever had a better opportunity to test\r\nitself and its ability to control the future than that phase of\r\ndemocratic life working out its destiny here at the South. For the\r\nconditions are such as to make the task of training the citizenship of\r\nthe future almost the one thing to be done. The figures representing\r\nthose conditions have been so often used of late that one is really\r\ninclined to resent the very mention of them. Nevertheless, a proper\r\nunderstanding of the conditions entering into this, as into any problem,\r\nis the first step toward the solution. Moreover, in this struggle now on\r\nfor popular education at the South, it is no part of courage to blink a\r\nfact because it is ugly, nor of sane judgment to let anything or anybody\r\nbeguile us into fighting our battle in the dark. We should keep steadily\r\nbefore us the facts as they are, the stupendous nature of the work that\r\nlies ahead and how it is to be done, and withal the eternally vital need\r\nof doing it now and in the right way.\r\n\r\nNow as far as figures can give one anything like an adequate conception,\r\nthe situation is about this: In 1900 there were 8,683,762 persons of\r\nschool age in what we are used to call the Southern states,—5,594,284\r\nwhite persons and 3,089,478 black. It should be said in passing, yet\r\nwith all emphasis, that the South may as well get used to reckoning the\r\nchildren of its former slaves in both its educational assets and\r\neducational liabilities. Justice and expediency are both vitally\r\ninvolved in this view of the situation. Now, of this future citizenship\r\nonly sixty out of every hundred were actually in process of school\r\ntraining, and of this enrollment only forty-two were, on the average, in\r\ndaily attendance. The only comfort that one can get in this situation is\r\nby looking back and seeing that conditions have been worse and forward\r\nto see that they are bound to be better.\r\n\r\nThese figures, then, represent the mass of material that popular\r\neducation has to deal with and the actual portion upon which it is\r\nreally working. Now when one considers the machinery of instruction, the\r\nteachers, the school-property, the length of terms, and the capital\r\ninvested, one sees even more vividly that the democracy of the immediate\r\nfuture must be limited in its development, not alone because its\r\nchildren are not in process of training but because the means themselves\r\nare inadequate and inefficient. The entire country pays, on the average,\r\nfor its men teachers a salary of $49.00 per month, for its women $40.00.\r\nThe South gets its men for $35.63 and its women for $30.47. Leaving out\r\nof consideration the quality of service to be had at such a pitifully\r\nlow price, one can be perfectly sure that no high professional ideals\r\nand standards can be maintained at such rates. But let us look at the\r\nmatter from another standpoint; upon every child in its schools the\r\nSouth spends $6.95 as against $10.57 for the entire country; while some\r\nstates of the West spend $31.49, some Southern states are spending only\r\n$4.50. It is not surprising therefore to see what this means as to the\r\naverage length of school term among us: in the entire country every\r\nchild has a chance to be in school at least 145 days, while the child of\r\nthe South has open to him only 99 days. Clear enough is it, then, that\r\ndemocracy in this section is, in comparison with the rest of the Union,\r\nhandicapped in the very beginning of its race. Moreover, the relation of\r\npopular education to its best life, in the light of the situation\r\nrevealed by these figures, is a deep and fundamental one.\r\n\r\nHow deep and fundamental this is, can be best realized by the\r\ncomparative density of illiteracy already prevailing at the South. Fifty\r\nout of every hundred negroes ten years old and over can neither read nor\r\nwrite, and nearly thirteen out of every hundred whites are in the same\r\ncondition of darkness. In the United States as many as 231 counties\r\nreport a proportion of twenty per cent of illiterate white men of voting\r\nage, and of the total, 210 of these counties are in the South. Now the\r\nconditions represented by all these figures—and at best they can only\r\nbring the matter vaguely to our conception—in one sense, on account of\r\nthe magnitude of the work to be done and the difficulties in the way,\r\nare of a nature almost to take hope and courage from us. On the other\r\nhand, the absolute need of doing the work, the fruits that must follow,\r\nand the progress already made are a clarion call to patience,\r\npatriotism, faith, and unresting effort.\r\n\r\nBut before taking up the progress already made, it would be well to\r\nremind ourselves once more of some of the causes which have brought\r\nabout the present state of affairs and render the Southern situation as\r\nto popular education a peculiar one. In the first place, there was the\r\nall but disheartening poverty due to the collapse of the entire social\r\nand industrial system of the South. War, followed by Reconstruction, did\r\nthe work with ruthless thoroughness. From 1860 to 1880 taxable property\r\nat the South suffered a decrease in value of $2,167,000,100, that is, to\r\nless than one-half its value at the breaking out of the War. Indeed, in\r\n1870 the one little state of Massachusetts paid considerably over\r\none-half the amount of taxes paid by the entire South. It is clear,\r\nthen, that for nearly twenty years the South was under the simple yet\r\nstern and inexorable compulsion of how to live. In this light,\r\ntherefore, what it did accomplish in the matter of training its children\r\nis to be regarded as a really heroic achievement, and is no occasion of\r\nblame because, by comparison, it seems so little. Absolutely, it is\r\nworthy of all praise.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, too, that in spite of its poverty, in spite of\r\nthe fact that its energies have been given to a pressing struggle for\r\nits very existence, the South has had to maintain a two-fold system of\r\npopular education. It has had to care for the children of its former\r\nslaves in separate schools, and bear virtually all the expense. This has\r\nboth complicated its problem and necessarily limited its educational\r\nadvancement. But at this time it can be asserted with emphasis, that the\r\nSouth, in spite of certain reactionary eddies in the current of its\r\nthinking, will still continue to support Negro schools. Our best thought\r\nis fast fixing itself in the unalterable conviction that to keep the\r\nblack man in ignorance is an injustice to ourselves as well as to him;\r\nand, moreover, that expediency itself dictates that he shall neither\r\nremain sunken in the night of illiteracy nor mistrained for the sphere\r\nof life for which he is, in his present stage of advancement, fitted.\r\nTherefore popular education has meant, will continue to mean, with the\r\nSouth a two-fold system of education. And the Southern white man, with\r\nhis own taxes, is largely to maintain it,—at least for many years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBut above everything else, the chief consideration with reference to the\r\nwhole question of popular education in the South, both as to its needs\r\nand difficulties, is that we are dealing with a rural folk and rural\r\nconditions. More than eighty-three per cent of the Southern people live\r\nin the country,—a pure, wholesome Anglo-Saxon stock of unwasted, if\r\nuntrained, physical, intellectual and moral qualities. The problem of\r\npopular education in villages, towns, and cities is virtually solved.\r\nThe task therefore is concerned wholly with what we shall do for and\r\nwith the saving, and in this case, the larger remnant which draws its\r\nsupport from the fields. No democracy ever had better or richer assets\r\nfrom which to recuperate itself, or a more inspiring duty to perform in\r\ngiving this class opportunity for training and development. But from the\r\nvery nature of the case the proper performance of this duty is a task of\r\nstupendous magnitude, and even an approximate accomplishment of it must\r\nwait upon necessarily slow processes. The deep-seated conservatism of\r\nthe people, the extent to which illiteracy prevails and the narrow\r\npoverty in many sections, remote and widely-sundered homes, roads almost\r\nimpassable at certain seasons of the year, the immediate need of the\r\nchildren in the fields, even if the best of schools were at their\r\ndoors,—here are conditions which would discourage any but a brave and\r\npatient people who believe in the divine right of all to whatever power\r\nthere is in knowledge and the bounden duty of the state to offer to all\r\nits opportunities.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither the pressure of poverty, nor the double burden of\r\ncaring for two races in separate schools, nor the special difficulty\r\ngrowing out of the peculiar nature of conditions, nor the huge magnitude\r\nof the task, has daunted courage or enfeebled effort. On every hand\r\nthere are inspiring marks of progress, and results prophetic of greater\r\nadvances yet to follow. In the first place, the last six or eight years\r\nhave been a period of quite remarkable educational agitation throughout\r\nthe entire South. Every kind of leadership has been systematically at\r\nwork to quicken the conscience and stir the sentiment of the people on\r\nthis subject. Pulpit, press, organized philanthropy, and civil authority\r\nhave combined with professional educators in a campaign whose\r\nrallying-cry has been the uplifting of democracy through the power of\r\nthe schoolhouse. The general result is an interest both wide and\r\nintelligent, an awakened conscience, and an aroused sentiment throughout\r\nall this Southern land, all of which tends to put behind special and\r\ndefinite efforts of improvement an irresistible public opinion. The\r\nSouth is therefore keenly realizing its sense of civic obligation and\r\nits duty to its own future, and when the South once sees its duty and\r\nthat rich vein of sentimentality, which lies at the basis of its\r\ntemperament, is once touched, there will be no turning back. And surely\r\nit has now seen its duty and its sentimentality is thoroughly alive to\r\nall that popular education means to the child of to-day and the state of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nFor this condition we have to thank, not only the church, the press, and\r\norganized philanthropy, but a strikingly courageous and far-sighted\r\npolitical leadership, which the situation has called forth,—men, for\r\nexample, like Governor Frazier of Tennessee, Governor Aycock of North\r\nCarolina, Governor Heyward of South Carolina, and Governor Montague of\r\nVirginia, men who have convincingly fought for the inalienable right of\r\nevery child to be trained by the state at public expense. To their\r\ninfluence must also be added the skilled patriotic service of such State\r\nSuperintendents of Public Instruction as Mynders, Martin, MacMahan,\r\nMerritt, Whitefield and Joyner,—men who seemed to regard their office as\r\npeculiarly the most sacred of all trusts committed by a people to public\r\nservants. The people have listened to such as these when they might have\r\nturned deaf ears to voices from any other source.\r\n\r\nToo much importance cannot be attached to the sentiment which has been\r\nthus created in the last half-dozen years. It was the necessary step in\r\nthe preparation for more definite things. Its immediate value has been\r\nin the awakening of people to such an extent that they will not only put\r\ntheir children in school but will also tax themselves for educational\r\npurposes. General and local taxation, as a result, has been increasing\r\nat a significant rate. Indeed, some of the Southern states are now\r\ngiving a larger proportion of their income from taxes to the use of\r\neducation than the states of the North and West. They are everywhere\r\nbuilding better schoolhouses, furnishing better equipment, and demanding\r\nbetter trained teachers. Consolidation of schools, free transportation,\r\nlonger terms, expert supervision, the removal of educational matters\r\nfrom the blight of political influence, are the things which now make\r\nthe educational atmosphere fairly electric with reform, and the next few\r\nyears will show a growth that will please even the most ardent optimist.\r\n\r\nThis general agitation has thus connected with it certain definite aims\r\nand methods of educational policy, which have already taken shape and\r\nare bearing fruit. Not the least important among them has been the\r\neffort to secure, above everything, trained teachers. Many of the states\r\nhave either established Normal Schools for this purpose or have added to\r\ntheir Universities departments of Education. But it has been felt that\r\neven these were not sufficient to meet the demands for a trained\r\nteaching force. Hence in some of the states, in Georgia, Mississippi,\r\nand South Carolina, for example, summer schools with an attendance of\r\nfrom four to six hundred have been running for a number of years, and at\r\nKnoxville the great Summer School has been drawing from all over the\r\nSouth a choice body of teachers to the number of two thousand, and\r\noffering them the best instruction to be had, North or South. To the\r\ninfluence of these general schools is to be added that of the County\r\nInstitutes, which of themselves have been an inestimable source of\r\npower. All have stood for an intelligent knowledge of the situation, for\r\nthe missionary spirit of propaganda, for a broader and more accurate\r\nscholarship on the part of the teacher, for the application of expert,\r\nup-to-date methods of instruction and organization, and for the raising\r\nof the teacher’s work to the dignity of a great profession. The\r\nsignificance of all this is that this movement for popular education is\r\nlaying its foundations in wisdom in that it sees that the teacher\r\nhimself must first be taught.\r\n\r\nAnd the work has already begun to tell to a degree that can even now be\r\nmeasured. In the last score of years Virginia has reduced its ratio of\r\nwhite illiteracy by 7 per cent, Georgia and Mississippi by 8, Kentucky\r\nby 10, Alabama by 11, North Carolina and Florida, by 12, Tennessee by\r\n13, and Arkansas by 14 per cent. These figures are eloquent of present\r\nprogress and inspiringly suggestive of the future. Democracy is really\r\ncaring for its own. It is told that a famous German teacher of the\r\nReformation once stepped into his schoolroom and greeted his pupils with\r\nthese words: “Hail, reverend pastors, doctors, superintendents, judges,\r\nchancellors, magistrates, professors.” Some there were who laughed at\r\nhim as a joker and mocker. But he was wiser than they, and in his wisdom\r\nwas the prophet of that true democracy which sees not merely the child\r\nin the school, but the future man in the state. The South therefore\r\nviews in this way the progress already made and realizes that what it\r\nnow does and will do with its children in the schools of the people is\r\nthe true measure of its own life in the coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TO HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n                            BY JAMES TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Forever veiled thy piteous eyes,\r\n                 Forever sealed thine ear;\r\n               How dark and still creation lies,\r\n                 How distant, yet how near!\r\n\r\n               Thy sightless orbs to heaven upturn\r\n                 To crave the blessed light;\r\n               Nor sun, nor stars, above thee burn—\r\n                 Alas, what hopeless night.\r\n\r\n               The jeweled arch that bends above,\r\n                 The earth, the air, the sea,\r\n               O’erspanned by wings of Boundless Love,\r\n                 How vainly smile for thee!\r\n\r\n               The blush of morn, the sunset glow,\r\n                 The dew-gemmed paradise\r\n               Where Summer’s roses blow,\r\n                 Are not for thy dim eyes.\r\n\r\n               Hushed is the sound of Music’s voice,\r\n                 Hushed is the murmuring sea;\r\n               No trembling harp bids thee rejoice,—\r\n                 ’Tis silence _all_ to thee.\r\n\r\n               On Beauty’s loom which Nature wields\r\n                 With deft, mysterious skill,\r\n               To deck with tapestries her fields,\r\n                 Her every vale and hill,\r\n\r\n               She weaves with gorgeous threads of light\r\n                 In mist, and cloud and rain,\r\n               Her irised gossamers so bright—\r\n                 But weaves for thee in vain.\r\n\r\n               But God will make thee doubly whole,\r\n                 And give thy spirit sight,—\r\n               His glory shall illume thy soul,\r\n                 For God is love and light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             MEN OF AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\n  With the commercial awakening of the South and the increased\r\n  importance of the section as a factor in the national life, has\r\n  developed a new citizenship—a sub-structure of the Old South with a\r\n  modernized superstructure—in which with the sterling and standard\r\n  traits of the old regime is strongly blended the nervous activity of\r\n  the new.

Edmonds.\r\n\r\n_The Manufacturers’ Record_, the South’s, if not the country’s, most\r\nrepresentative trades journal, had a modest origin less than a quarter\r\nof a century ago in a small desk in an obscure business office in\r\nBaltimore. Its founder and guiding spirit was Richard M. Edmonds, who\r\nfrom nothing in the way of working capital save sagacity, energy and\r\ndetermination, has developed a magnificent journalistic property,\r\noccupying its own seven-story building and has himself become a man of\r\nlarge affairs and wide influence.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the now admittedly fertile field of trades\r\njournalism, no one point may be more emphasized as having been\r\nsignificantly demonstrated than that it holds peculiar and pronounced\r\nopportunities for those desirous of actively participating in the vital\r\nactivities of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn no less than three distinct phases of Southern development have Mr.\r\nEdmonds and his paper conspicuously figured—in the encouragement of\r\nindustrial and technical education, in the promotion of the cause of\r\nimmigration from among the most desirable domestic elements and the\r\ndiverting of the cotton manufacturing business from New England to the\r\ncotton fields. It was Mr. Edmonds’ editorial columns that first started\r\nthe now irresistible southward migration of the mills by pointing out\r\nthe many and conclusive reasons why the advantages for cotton\r\nmanufacturing were all in favor of the South.\r\n\r\nAs a commercial and financial figure it may be noted that Mr. Edmonds is\r\nnow a member of the executive committee of the International Trust\r\nCompany, a three million dollar Baltimore corporation, and is chairman\r\nof the executive committee of the Alabama Consolidated Coal and Iron\r\nCompany, with a capitalization twice that of the former. He is a member\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American\r\nAcademy of Political and Social Science, the Southern History\r\nAssociation, the Maryland Historical Society, the Southern Society of\r\nNew York, and other organizations.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonds was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1857, receiving a common school\r\neducation in Baltimore, where he started life as a clerk in the office\r\nof the old _Journal of Commerce_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD M.

After his retirement from this\r\nposition he became District Attorney for Tennessee and northern Alabama\r\nfor the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, from which he was\r\npromoted to his present position as Chief Counsel for the Illinois\r\nCentral, with headquarters at Chicago.\r\n\r\nHis greatest public service, as is well known, was his representation of\r\nthe government in the Alaskan boundary dispute, wherein his presentation\r\nof the nation’s claims is admitted to have had a material influence in\r\nthe successful outcome of that famous piece of international litigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES McGAVOCK DICKINSON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nJudge Dickinson maintains a close identity with Southern matters by\r\nkeeping up his connection with various societies and organizations,\r\namong the number being the Isham Harris Confederate Bivouac, at his\r\nnative town, Columbus, Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Samuel Spencer.\r\n\r\nIn the executive feature of railroad operation Samuel Spencer is a\r\nprominent national figure. From an humble position in the ranks, a\r\ncombination of native ability, splendid equipment and consistent\r\napplication has resulted in his promotion to the presidency of six large\r\nroads, while he is in addition a member of the board of directors of\r\nnearly a score of others and of nearly a dozen of the country’s most\r\nrepresentative banking and other corporations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL SPENCER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA native of Georgia, where he was born at Columbus, in 1847, Mr. Spencer\r\nentered the Confederate army, serving the last two years and with much\r\ncredit, after which he graduated from the University of Georgia with\r\nA.B., and subsequently from the University of Virginia with his\r\nengineering degree.\r\n\r\nSince leaving college in 1869 Mr. Spencer has devoted his energies\r\nuniformly to his ambition to rise to the highest round of the railroad\r\nladder, with the result that he is now president of the Southern, the\r\nMobile and Ohio, the Alabama and Great Southern, the Cincinnati, New\r\nOrleans and Texas Pacific, the Georgia Southern and Florida, and the\r\nNorthern Alabama, aggregating a mileage of over nine thousand miles and\r\nemploying more than forty thousand men.\r\n\r\nBesides innumerable other roads, in the management of which Mr. Spencer\r\nis director, he is also a director of the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany, the Old Dominion Steamship Company, three large New York Trust\r\ncompanies, the Hanover National Bank of New York, and one of Boston’s\r\nlarge street railway systems.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer is identified with the American Society of Civil Engineers\r\nand other representative political, scientific and forestry\r\nassociations, and is socially very much of a cosmopolite, being a member\r\nof New York, Chicago, Cincinnati, Atlanta and Macon clubs, besides that\r\nwealthy sportsman’s paradise, the Jekyl Island Club.\r\n\r\nOne of the very few Southerners who have advanced into the circles of\r\nmillionairedom, Mr. Spencer resides principally in New York and\r\nWashington, but is much in the South and is still in feeling and\r\nsentiment very much a Southerner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        James Clarke McReynolds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES C. McREYNOLDS\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the appointment of James C. McReynolds to be Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral of the United States the President followed his revolutionary\r\nprecedent in the selection of Judge Thomas G. Jones, of Alabama, as\r\noccupant of the Federal Bench. In this instance conventional custom was\r\nfurther ignored in the elevation of a man considerably younger than the\r\nage generally considered requisite.\r\n\r\nBorn at Elkton, Ky., a little over forty years ago, Mr. McReynolds was\r\ngraduated from Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia with\r\nhis academic and law degrees, respectively, in both of which\r\ninstitutions he ranked high in scholarship and character.\r\n\r\nHis initial experience in public life was gained as the private\r\nsecretary of Judge Howell E. Jackson of the United States Supreme Bench,\r\nwhich, with his already ample legal equipment, served him in good stead\r\nin the general practice in Nashville where his career at the bar was\r\ncharacterized by ability, integrity and a high order of fidelity to the\r\nmany large interests that he represented.\r\n\r\nIn civic and political movements Mr. McReynolds’ record was signalized\r\nby a notably courageous, independent and unselfish interest.\r\n\r\nSince his promotion to the duties of Assistant Attorney General of the\r\nUnited States he has established principles of large governmental\r\nsignificance and his able presentation of the government’s litigation\r\nbefore the Supreme Court has elicited the unanimous commendation of that\r\nimpartial and august body.\r\n\r\nMr. McReynolds’ appreciation by the President would have been further\r\ndisplayed by his appointment as United States District Judge to succeed\r\nJudge Hammond, had not a technicality involving residence interfered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS DIXON, JR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Thomas Dixon, Jr.\r\n\r\nOne of the most picturesque and dramatic figures in the limelight of\r\nto-day is the Rev. Thomas Dixon, Jr., a man who has at his age probably\r\nsucceeded in as many different lines of endeavor as any other man of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAn intense product of the new South, Mr. Dixon speaks his opinions on\r\nhis section’s great and peculiar problems with an incisive virility and\r\na fearless conviction, and with his novels, “The Leopard’s Spots” and\r\n“The Clansman” has gained a popular audience for the Southern point of\r\nview, before unreached. He has also illumined the divorce evil and the\r\nsubject of socialism in his dramatic story, “The One Woman.”\r\n\r\nBorn in North Carolina just forty years ago, and educated at Wake\r\nForest, a Baptist denominational school, Mr. Dixon has in rapid\r\nsuccession essayed the fields of law, the ministry, lecturing and\r\nauthorship, and has been prominently identified with each. He was a\r\nmember of the North Carolina legislature at one time and is said to have\r\nessayed the histrionic for a brief spell.\r\n\r\nFirst attaining more than casual prominence as a Baptist minister in New\r\nYork, Mr. Dixon felt the opportunity of a non-sectarian evangelist\r\nfraught with higher possibilities in the metropolis and more in keeping\r\nwith his temperament and convictions, founding a popular church wherein\r\nas a religious and civic free lance he attracted a large and influential\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nOn the lecture platform he found a broader and more congenial labor\r\nstill, and from lecturing he took to literature, to which he is now\r\ndevoting his time exclusively. He has planned a trilogy of novels in\r\nexposition of the negro question, the second of which, “The Clansman,”\r\ntakes its text from the vital role played by the Ku Klux in the\r\nredemption of the South from the triple scourge of the carpet bagger,\r\nthe scalawag and their irresponsible tool, the ignorant African.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon’s late successes have constituted him a man of affairs and he\r\nnow resides upon his extensive Virginia plantation, where he does much\r\nof his literary work and incidentally lives the life of the Virginia\r\nplanter and gentleman of the olden day.\r\n\r\nHe is proud to admit the valuable assistance rendered him by his wife,\r\nnot only as literary critic but as a ready helper in the physical\r\nconstruction of his productions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN TEMPLE GRAVES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          John Temple Graves.\r\n\r\nAs lecturer, orator and editor, John Temple Graves, of Atlanta, is well\r\nknown to the country at large.

Grady; and as an editor he has by the\r\nforcefulness of his personality developed in a brief period of time an\r\nextensive business enterprise and a material public influence in his\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves’ most telling work on the platform has doubtless been his\r\ncontribution to the enlightenment of the Northern mind on the negro\r\nquestion, while on this and various other subjects he has appeared three\r\ntimes as the orator of the New England Society of Boston, twice of the\r\nMerchants’ Club of Boston, once of the New England Society of\r\nPhiladelphia and twice of the Southern Society of New York. In the\r\ncapacity of journalist he has officially represented the South as\r\nspokesman before the World’s Congress of Journalists at Chicago, in\r\n1893, and also before the World’s Press Parliament at St. Louis, last\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nAs a memorial orator Mr. Graves is entitled to distinguished rank, it\r\nhaving devolved upon him to deliver the funeral orations over the\r\nremains of his state’s most eminent sons—Grady and Gordon.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves is still a young man and is a native of Rome, Ga., and a\r\ngraduate of his state institution at Athens, of which he is a devoted\r\nalumnus. He now devotes his time chiefly to his journalistic interests\r\nand resides in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThough not a politician Mr. Graves has been twice elector at large in\r\ntwo consecutive presidential campaigns in different states, and has led\r\nthe Democratic ticket in both instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IN VENICE.\r\n\r\n                        BY ISABELLA HOWE FISKE.\r\n\r\n           All seems a dream of art—upon the arch\r\n           Of the grey bridge, the dim canal that spans,\r\n           A child steps, hand-raised, and my eye that scans,\r\n           Can scarce believe that here too, centuries march,\r\n           For Titian might have painted her just so,\r\n           Slow-foot Venetian centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          JOSEPH A. ALTSHELER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Joseph A. Altsheler, whose story, “The Lost Herd,” follows, is a\r\n  representative type of the new generation of Southerners in\r\n  contemporary literature.\r\n\r\n  Born, reared and educated in the South, he has won successive and\r\n  substantial laurels in both journalism and literature, and is at\r\n  present the unusual combination of a successful figure in both fields.\r\n\r\n  Born in Kentucky, that commonwealth that has contributed so many\r\n  distinguished workers to the literary history of the day, he attended\r\n  the local schools of his native heath in the southern part of the\r\n  state until entering Vanderbilt University, where he ranked high in\r\n  class work, being a Latin scholarship man.\r\n\r\n  After leaving college, he immediately took up journalistic work in\r\n  Louisville with _The Evening Post_, subsequently going with the\r\n  _Courier-Journal_, with which paper he remained several years, gaining\r\n  wide journalistic experience as legislative correspondent, dramatic\r\n  critic, city editor and editorial writer.\r\n\r\n  In 1892 Mr. Altsheler followed the almost inevitable ambition of the\r\n  American with pronounced literary attainments, migrating to the broad\r\n  and inviting field of the metropolis, since which time he has\r\n  successively filled responsible positions with the _New York World_,\r\n  being at present in charge of its tri-weekly edition.\r\n\r\n  About nine years ago Mr. Altsheler turned his attention seriously to\r\n  fiction, since which time he has produced no less than ten novels, in\r\n  many of which he has drawn largely upon his own extensive personal\r\n  experiences as a journalist.\r\n\r\n  His first book was “The Sun of Saratoga,” while his latest is “Guthrie\r\n  of the Times,” a contemporary romance with a strong political flavor.\r\n  He has now in press “The Candidate,” also a novel of the day, and\r\n  likewise treating of political life, this time in the West instead of\r\n  in Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LOST HERD.\r\n\r\n                        By Joseph A. Altsheler.\r\n\r\n\r\nRedfield parted the twining bushes with both hands, and pushed his body\r\nthrough the cleft, while I stood by to see the issue. He took but a\r\nsingle step and then threw himself back like a soldier who would escape\r\na bullet, his face, now turned toward me, showing a yellowish hue in the\r\nmoonlight. He raised his hand and wiped his damp forehead, while I gazed\r\nat him in silence, seeing fear, sudden and absolute, in his gaze, as if\r\ndeath had faced him, with no warning.\r\n\r\nWe stood so, for a few moments, until the terror died slowly in his\r\neyes, when he took another step back, and laughing a little, in a\r\nnervous way, pointed before him with a long forefinger.\r\n\r\nI advanced, but he put a restraining hand upon my shoulder, and bade me\r\ntake only a single step. I obeyed and, with his hand still on my\r\nshoulder, looked down a drop of a thousand feet, steep like the side of\r\na house, the hard stone of the wall showing gray and bronze, where the\r\nlight of the moon fell upon it.\r\n\r\nI saw at the bottom masses of foliage like the tops of trees, and\r\nrunning through them a thread of silver, which I felt sure was the\r\nstream of a brook or creek. We were looking into a green valley, and now\r\nI understood Redfield’s terror, when instinct or quickness of eye, or\r\nboth, saved him from the next step, which would have taken him to sure\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe valley looked pleasant, with green trees and running water, and I\r\nsuggested that it would furnish a good camp to us who were weary of\r\nmountains and ravines and stony paths.\r\n\r\nRedfield pointed straight before us, and three miles away rose the\r\nmountain wall again, steep and bare, the hard stone gleaming in the\r\nmoonlight. I followed his finger as he moved it around in a circle, and\r\nthe wall was there, everywhere. The valley seemed to be enclosed by\r\nsteep mountains as completely as the sea rings around a coral island.\r\n\r\nI said that I had never heard of such a place in these mountains, and\r\nRedfield reminded me that there were many things of which neither he nor\r\nI had ever heard, and perhaps never would hear.\r\n\r\nHis retort did not dim my curiosity, in which he shared fully, and,\r\nlying down for greater security, we stared over the brink into the\r\nvalley, which looked like a huge bowl, sunk there by nature. The sky was\r\nclear, the moon was rising, and we could see the boughs of the trees\r\nbelow waving in the gentle wind. The silver thread of the brook widened,\r\ncutting across the valley like a sword blade, and we almost believed\r\nthat we saw soft green turf by its banks. But on all sides of the bowl\r\ntowered the stone walls, carved into fantastic figures by the action of\r\ntime and mountain torrents.\r\n\r\nThe green valley below could not remove the sense of desolation which\r\nthe walls, grim and hard, inspired. My eyes turned from the foliage to\r\nthe sweep of stone rising above, black where the light could not reach\r\nit, then gray and bronze and purple and green as if the moon’s rays had\r\nbeen tinted by some hidden alchemy. I assisted nature with my own\r\nimagination and carved definite shapes—impish faces and threatening\r\narmies in the solid stone of the walls. I felt the shiver of Redfield’s\r\nhand, which was still upon my shoulder, and he complained that he was\r\nchilled. I knew it to be the stony desolation of the walls, and not the\r\ncold of the night, that made him shiver, for I, too, felt it in my\r\nbones, and I proposed that we look no more, at least not then, but build\r\na fire, and rest and sleep.\r\n\r\nWe did as I proposed, but while we gathered the fallen brushwood, each\r\nknew what was in the other’s mind; the mystery of the valley was upon\r\nus, and we would wait only until daylight to enter it and see what it\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nRedfield lighted the fire, and the blaze, rising above the heaps of dry\r\nsticks and boughs, was twisted into coils of red ribbon by the wind; a\r\nthin cloud of smoke gathered and floated off over the valley, where it\r\nhung like a mist, while the wind moaned in the great cleft.\r\n\r\nRedfield complained that he was still cold, and wrapping his blanket\r\ntightly around him, sat close to the fire, where I noticed that he did\r\nnot cease to shiver. I spread out my own blanket, and by and by both of\r\nus lay down on the grass seeking sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke far in the night, the fire had burned down, the moon was\r\ngone, and Redfield’s figure, beyond the bed of coals, was almost hidden\r\nby the darkness. Damp mists had gathered on the mountain, and my hand,\r\nas I drew the corners of the blanket around my throat, shook with cold.\r\n\r\nNot being able to sleep again just then, I rose and put more wood on the\r\nheap of coals. But the fire burned with a languid, drooping blaze,\r\ngiving out little warmth and offering no resistance to the encroaching\r\ndarkness. Redfield slept heavily and was so still that he lay like one\r\ndead. The flickering light of the fire fell over his face sometimes and\r\ntinted it with a pale red.\r\n\r\nI sat by the coals a little while, looking around at the dim forest, and\r\nthen the attraction of the great pit, or valley, drew me toward it.\r\n\r\nI knelt down at the brink, holding to the scrubby bushes with each hand,\r\nand looked over, but I could no longer see the trees and brook below.\r\nThe valley was filled with mists and vapors, and from some point beneath\r\ncame the loud moan of the wind.\r\n\r\nI stayed there a long time, gazing down at the clouds and vapors, which\r\nheaped upon each other and dissolved, showing denser vapors below, and\r\nthen heaped up in terraces again. The stone walls, when I caught\r\nglimpses of them, seemed wholly black in the darkness of the night, and\r\nthe queer shapes which took whatever form my fancy wished were\r\nexaggerated and distorted by the faintness of the light. The place put a\r\nspell upon me; if Redfield would not go with me in the morning to\r\nexplore it, though knowing well he would, I resolved to go alone, and\r\nsee what, if anything, was there besides grass and trees and water. I\r\nfelt the strange desire to throw myself from a height which sometimes\r\nlays hold of people, and instantly pulling myself back from the brink I\r\nreturned to the fire. Redfield was yet sleeping heavily and the flames\r\nhad sunk again, flickering and nodding as they burned low. I lay down\r\nand slept until morning, when I awoke to find that Redfield was already\r\ncooking our breakfast. He proposed that we begin the descent in an hour,\r\nand like myself he seemed to have accepted the conclusion that we had\r\nagreed upon the attempt, though neither had said a word about it.\r\n\r\nThe valley assumed a double aspect in the bright light of the morning,\r\ngreen and pleasant far down where the grass grew and the brook flowed,\r\nbut grim and gaunt as ever in its wide expanse of rocky wall. The rising\r\nsun broke in a thousand colored lights upon the cliffs, and the stony\r\nangles and corners threw off tiny spear points of flame. The majesty of\r\nthe place which had taken hold of us by night held its sway by day.\r\n\r\nWe had no doubt that we should find a slope suitable for descent if we\r\nsought long enough, and we pushed our way through the bushes and over\r\nthe masses of sharp and broken stone along the brink until our bones\r\nached and our spirit was weak. Yet we encouraged each other with the\r\nhope that we would soon reach such a place, though the circle of the\r\nvalley was soon proved to be much greater than we had expected.\r\n\r\nNoon came and we were forced to rest and eat some of the cold food that\r\nwe had wisely brought with us. The sun was hot on the mountains and the\r\nstone walls of the valley threw the light back in our eyes until,\r\ndazzled, we were forced to look away. But we had no thought of ceasing\r\nthe quest; such a discovery was not made merely to leave the valley\r\nunexplored, and rising again after food and rest we resumed our task.\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon I saw a break in the wall which we\r\nthought to be a ravine or gully of sufficient slope to permit of our\r\ndescent into the valley, but it was nearly night when we reached the\r\nplace and found our opinion was correct.\r\n\r\nThe ravine was well lined with short bushes which seemed to ensure a\r\nsafe descent, even in twilight, and we began the downward climb, seeking\r\na secure resting place among the rocks for each footstep and holding\r\nwith both hands to the bushes and vines.\r\n\r\nThe sun, setting in a sky of unbroken blue, poured a flood of red and\r\ngolden light into the valley. The walls blazed with vivid colors, and\r\nthe green of the trees and grass was deepened. Redfield stopped, and\r\ntouching me on the shoulder pointed with his finger to the little plain\r\nin the center of the valley where a buffalo herd was grazing. Such they\r\nwere we knew at the first glance, for one could not mistake the great\r\nforms, the humped shoulders and shaggy necks.\r\n\r\nNeither of us sought to conceal his surprise, and perhaps neither would\r\nhave believed what his eyes told him had it not been for the presence\r\nand confirmation of the other. We knew, as everybody else knew, that the\r\nwild buffalo had been exterminated in this region years ago, and that\r\neven now the only herd left in the whole United States was somewhere in\r\nthe tangled mountains of Colorado, and yet here we were gazing upon\r\nanother herd of these great animals, at least fifty of them, for we\r\ncould count them as they moved placidly about and cropped the short\r\nturf.\r\n\r\nWe remained a quarter of an hour in that notch in the wall exulting over\r\nour second discovery, for we considered the tenants of the valley of as\r\ngreat importance as the valley itself, and exchanged with each other\r\nsentences of surprise and wonder. The sun hovered directly over the\r\nfurther brink, and poised there, a huge globe of red, shot through with\r\norange light, it seemed to pour all its rays upon the valley.\r\n\r\nEvery object was illumined and enlarged. The buffaloes rose to a\r\ngigantic height, the trees were tipped with fire, and the brook gleamed\r\nred and yellow where the rays of the sun struck directly upon it. Again\r\nwe said to each other what a wonderful discovery was ours and looked to\r\nthe rifles that we had strapped across our backs, for seeing the great\r\ngame of the valley we had it in mind to enjoy unequalled sport. I\r\nlamented the speedy departure of the day, but Redfield thought the night\r\nwould give us a better chance to stalk the big game, and thus talking we\r\nresumed the descent. The sun sank behind the mountains, the red and\r\ngolden lights faded, and the valley lay below us in darkness. The\r\nbuffalo herd had disappeared from our sight, but feeling sure that we\r\nshould find it we continued our descent, clinging to the bushes and\r\nvines, and wary with our footing.\r\n\r\nThe twilight was not so deep that the gray mountain walls did not show\r\nthrough it, and as we painfully continued our descent the trees and the\r\nbrook rose again out of the dusk. Nearing the last steps of the slope we\r\ncould see that the valley was much larger than it had looked from above,\r\nand our wonder at the presence of the herd was equalled by our wonder at\r\nthe manner in which it had ever reached such a place, as there seemed to\r\nbe no entrance save the perilous path by which we had come.\r\n\r\nAt last we left the bushes and stones of the ravine and, standing with\r\nfeet half buried in the soft turf of the valley, looked up at the sky as\r\nif from the bottom of a pit.\r\n\r\nThe twilight was as clear around us as it had been on the mountain\r\nabove, and we could see a pleasant stretch of sward, the land rolling\r\ngently, with clumps of bushes and large trees clustering here and there.\r\n\r\nWe did not pause to look about, both being filled with the ardor of the\r\nchase, and we walked quickly toward the little bit of prairie in which\r\nwe had seen the buffaloes, examining our rifles to be sure that they\r\nwere loaded properly. I felt that sense of unreality which strange\r\nsurroundings always give.\r\n\r\nThe night, now fully come, was not dark, the stars were appearing and a\r\npale light glimmered along the edges of the cliffs, which seemed, as I\r\nlooked up, to overhang and threaten us.\r\n\r\nWe reached the brook that we had seen from above, a fine stream of clear\r\nwater, a foot deep and a dozen or more across. We paused there to drink\r\nand refresh ourselves, and found it cool and natural to the taste. I\r\nsupposed that it flowed into some cave through the mountain, since I\r\ncould not imagine any other outlet; but the matter remained for only a\r\nfew seconds in my mind, as Redfield began to tug at my sleeve and urge\r\nme on to the chase, to which I was nothing loth.\r\n\r\nYet I noticed that there were no other signs of animal life in the\r\nvalley. Not a rabbit popped up in the grass; the trees were fresh with\r\nfoliage, but no birds flew among the boughs. All around us was silence,\r\nsave for the soft crush of our own footsteps and our breathing, now\r\nquickened by our exertions. I called Redfield’s attention to this\r\nsilence and absence of life, and we stopped again and listened but heard\r\nnothing. The night was without wind; I could not see a leaf on the trees\r\nstir, the air felt close and heavy, and Redfield told me that my face\r\nwas without color; I had noticed that fact already in his.\r\n\r\nFifty yards farther and we came to the open space in which we had seen\r\nthe herd, and we felt sure that it was not far beyond us, for the heads\r\nof the animals had been turned south and we believed they had continued\r\nto move in that direction as they nibbled the grass. We paused to take\r\nanother look at our rifles, our ardor for the chase rising to the\r\nhighest, leaving us no thought of anything but to kill.\r\n\r\nI had never before hunted such big game and I felt now the thrill which\r\nleads men to risk their own lives that they may take those of the most\r\ndangerous wild beasts. The twilight had deepened somewhat, and though of\r\na grayer tone in the valley, where mists seemed to be collected and\r\nhemmed, it was not dense enough to hinder our pursuit.\r\n\r\nRedfield paused suddenly and put his hand upon my shoulder though I had\r\nseen them as soon as he. The herd was grazing in the edge of a little\r\ngrove a few hundred yards ahead of us, but within plain sight. This\r\ncloser view confirmed our count from the mountain-side that they were\r\nabout fifty in number, and admiration mingled with our wonder, for they\r\nwere magnificent in size, true monarchs of the wilderness, grazing,\r\nunseen by man, while the rush of civilization passed around their\r\nmountains and pressed on, hundreds of miles into the Farther West. Their\r\nfigures stood out in the gray twilight, huge and somber, surpassing in\r\nsize anything that I had imagined. I felt a joy that I was one of the\r\ntwo whose fortune it was to find such game, a proud anticipation of the\r\ntrophies that I would show. I saw the same exhilaration in Redfield’s\r\neyes, and again we spoke to each other of our fortune.\r\n\r\nI held up a wet finger, and finding that the wind was blowing from the\r\nherd toward us we resumed our advance, sure that we could approach near\r\nenough for rifle shot. The herd was noiseless, like ourselves, the huge\r\nbeasts seeming to step lightly as they cropped the grass, the scraping\r\nof the bushes as they pushed through them not reaching our ears. Again\r\nthe sense of silence, of desolation oppressed me. The grayness over\r\neverything, the trees, the grass, the mountains, Redfield, myself even,\r\nthe unreality of the place and our situation seized me and clung to me,\r\nthough I strengthened my will and went on, the zeal of the chase\r\ndirecting all else.\r\n\r\nOur stalking proceeded with a success that was encouraging to novices\r\nlike ourselves, and a few more cautious steps would take us within good\r\nrifle shot. We marked two of the animals, the largest two of the herd,\r\nstanding near a clump of bushes, and we agreed that we should fire first\r\nupon these, Redfield taking the one on the right. If we failed to slay\r\nat the first shot, which was very likely, the chase would be sure to\r\nlead us directly down the valley, and we could easily slip fresh\r\ncartridges into our rifles as we ran. Nor could the game escape us\r\nwithin such restricted limits; and thus, feeling secure of our triumph,\r\nwe slipped forward with the greatest caution until we were within the\r\nfair range that we wished. Then we stood motionless until we could\r\nsecure the best aim, each selecting the target upon which we had agreed.\r\n\r\nThe herd seemed to have no suspicion of our presence. However acute\r\nmight be the buffalo’s sense of smell, it had brought to them no warning\r\nof our presence. Their heads were half buried in the long grass, and as\r\nI looked along the barrel of my rifle, I felt again the stillness of the\r\nvalley, the utter sense of loneliness which made me creep a little\r\ncloser to Redfield, even as I sought the vital spot in the animal at\r\nwhich I aimed my rifle.\r\n\r\nRedfield whispered that we could hardly miss at such good range, and\r\nthen we pulled trigger so close together that our two rifles made one\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nWe were good marksmen, but both the buffaloes whirled about, untouched\r\nas far as we could see, and looked at us. The entire herd followed these\r\ntwo leaders, and in an instant fifty pairs of red eyes confronted\r\nRedfield and myself. Then they charged us like a troop of cavalry, heads\r\ndown, their great shoulders heaving up. We slipped hasty cartridges into\r\nour rifles and fired again, but the shots, like the first, seemed to\r\nhave no effect, and, in frightened fancy, feeling the breath of the\r\nangry beasts already in our faces, we turned and ran with all speed up\r\nthe valley, in fear of our lives and praying silently for refuge. I hung\r\nto my rifle with a kind of instinct, and I noticed that Redfield, too,\r\ncarried his. I looked once over my shoulder and saw the herd pursuing,\r\nnot fifty feet away, in solid line like the front of an attacking\r\nsquare. I shouted to Redfield to dart to one side among some trees,\r\nhoping that the heavy brutes would rush past us as we could not hope to\r\noutrun them in a straight course, and he obeyed with promptness. We\r\ngained a little by the trick, but the buffaloes turned again presently,\r\nand then we seized the hanging boughs of two convenient trees, and,\r\nmanaging to retain our rifles, climbed hastily up and out of present\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes stopped about a hundred feet away, still in unbroken\r\nphalanx, and stared at us with red eyes. I was filled with fear; I will\r\nnot deny it, I felt it in every fiber. I had heard always that these\r\nbeasts, however huge, were harmless, their first rush over, but they\r\nwere looking at us now with eyes of human intelligence and even more\r\nthan human rage; a steady, tenacious anger that threatened us, and\r\nseemed to demand our lives as the price of our attempt upon theirs. I\r\nfelt cold to the bone, and the angry gaze of the besieging beasts held\r\nmy own eyes until I turned them away, with an effort, and looked at\r\nRedfield. Then I saw that he was as white and afraid as I knew myself to\r\nbe. I told him that we were besieged, and he rejoined that the attitude,\r\nthe look of our besiegers, betokened persistency.\r\n\r\nWhile we talked, the buffaloes began to move and we hoped that we had\r\nbeen mistaken in our belief, and that they would abandon us, but the\r\nhope was idle. They formed a complete circle around us, a ring of\r\nsentinels, each motionless after he had assumed his proper position, the\r\nred eyes shining out of the massive, lowered heads, and fixed on us.\r\nRedfield laughed, but it was not the laugh of mirth. He asked me what we\r\nhad to fear from the buffalo, which was not a beast of prey; they would\r\nturn away presently and begin to crop the grass again, but his tone did\r\nnot express a belief in his own words.\r\n\r\nThe night had not darkened, but the curious grayness which was the\r\nprevailing quality of the atmosphere in the valley had deepened, and the\r\nforms of the beasts on guard became less distinct. Yet it seemed only to\r\nincrease the penetrating gaze of their eyes, which flamed at us like a\r\ncircle of watch fires. The sentinels were noiseless as well as\r\nmotionless. The wind whimpered gently through the leaves of the trees,\r\nbut there was nothing else to be heard in the valley, and saving\r\nourselves and the buffaloes, nothing of human or animal life to be seen.\r\nRedfield said to me that he wished our guards would move, that while\r\nthey stayed in such fixed attitudes he felt as if we were watched by so\r\nmany human beings. His voice was at a higher pitch than usual, and I\r\nfelt a strange pleasure in noticing it, for I knew then that he had been\r\naffected as I by our peculiar position. He burst suddenly into a laugh,\r\nand when I asked him where he found amusement, he reminded me that both\r\nof us yet carried our rifles, though we seemed to have forgotten the use\r\nfor which they were made. He added that the sentinels were within easy\r\nrange, and since our object was now self-preservation and not sport, we\r\ncould sit on the boughs in perfect safety and shoot as many of them as\r\nwe chose, unless they retired.\r\n\r\nIt was the power of surprise and fear that had prevented us from\r\nthinking of this before, though the weapons were in our hands, and I\r\nfelt a sense of shame that we had permitted ourselves to be overwhelmed\r\nin such a manner. I waited before raising my own rifle, to see the\r\neffect of Redfield’s shot. I saw him select his target and look down the\r\nbarrel of his rifle as he sought to make his aim true. The eyes of the\r\nbuffalo had seemed so human in their intelligence and anger that I\r\nexpected to see the animal, knowing his danger, retreat when the rifle\r\nwas raised. But he made no motion, looking straight into the muzzle of\r\nthe weapon which was threatening him. Redfield pulled the trigger and\r\nfired, and then both of us cried out in surprise and displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo did not move, and if the bullet had touched him there was no\r\nmark upon him that we could see to tell of its passage. Redfield said it\r\nwas the bad light that had made him miss, but I believed it was a\r\ntrembling hand—that the chill, though the night was warm, which affected\r\nme had seized him, too. Yet I steadied myself now that my own time to\r\nfire had come, and took good aim at the buffalo nearest to my tree. It\r\nmay have been the strength of my imagination, and in reality the eyes of\r\nthe brute may not have been visible at all at such a distance and in the\r\nnight, but I was sure that they were staring at me with human malice,\r\nand another expression, too, that I interpreted as defiance. I was\r\nseized with a sudden and fierce anger—anger because I had been afraid,\r\nanger because there was a taunt in the eyes of the beast.\r\n\r\nI pulled the trigger and looked eagerly at the result of my shot; then I\r\ncried aloud in disappointment, as Redfield had done. The buffalo,\r\nuntouched, was staring at me with the same malicious eyes, not even\r\nmoving his head when I fired.\r\n\r\nRedfield laughed once more in a mirthless way, and I told him angrily to\r\nhush; that he was afraid but I was not, and I would fire again. I put in\r\na second cartridge but the shot was as futile as the first, and\r\nRedfield, who tried once more, had a similar lack of success. But we\r\ntold each other, and with all the greater emphasis because we were not\r\nsure of it, that it was the imperfect light and our nerves strained by\r\nthe descent of the rough cliff. I noticed that Redfield’s voice was\r\ngrowing louder and more uneven as we talked, and his eyes were gleaming.\r\n\r\nAt last we exhausted our cartridges without touching the silent ring of\r\nsentinels, or making any of them move, and Redfield, throwing his rifle\r\nto the ground, laughed in the curious, unnatural way that makes one\r\nshiver. I bade him stop and I spoke with anger, but he paid no attention\r\neither to my words or my manner. His laughter ended shrilly, and then he\r\nsaid that he understood it all: that these animals had been hunted from\r\nthe face of the earth except this lone herd, which was left here to hunt\r\nany man who came against it. Behold the present as the proof of what he\r\nsaid!\r\n\r\nI laughed at him, yet my laughter, like his, sounded strange even in my\r\nown ears, and looking at the silent ring of sentinels, I believed his\r\nwords to be true. When or how we should escape I could not foresee, and\r\nI did not feel the fear of death; and yet there was nothing that I had\r\nin the world which I would not have given to be out of the valley. The\r\nrifle which I had used to such little purpose burned my hands, and I let\r\nit drop to the ground.\r\n\r\nRedfield laughed again in a shrill, acrid way, and when I asked him to\r\nstop, jeered at me and bade me notice how faithful our besiegers were to\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nNot one of them had moved from the circle, their forms becoming duskier\r\nas the night deepened, but growing larger in the thick atmosphere. The\r\nsky above was cloudless, and we seemed to see it from interminable\r\ndepths; the huge cliffs rose out of the mists, shapeless walls, and the\r\ntrees became gray and shadowy. Redfield began to talk, volubly and about\r\nnothing, varying his chatter with the same shrill, unpleasant laughter,\r\nand I, finding it useless to bid him hush, said nothing. Yet I wished\r\nthat he would cease, and I might hear other sounds, the leap of a rabbit\r\nor the scamper of a deer, anything to disturb that horrible chatter, and\r\nthe equally horrible silence, otherwise. Securing myself in the crook of\r\na bough and the tree I tried to sleep, and I think that at last I fell\r\ninto a kind of stupor, in which I heard only Redfield’s shrill laugh.\r\nBut I awoke from it to find a clear moon, and our silent line of\r\nsentinels still there. The wind, risen somewhat, was moaning up the\r\nvalley and the night was cold.\r\n\r\nRedfield was silent then, but when I called to him he answered in a\r\nnatural tone for the first time in hours and asked me if I had anything\r\nto suggest, as we must change our present position very soon. I told him\r\nthat we must descend from the trees, find the path out of the valley and\r\nleave by it, at once. He pointed to the sentinels and said nothing would\r\ninduce him to face them, but I told him we must do it since it was the\r\nonly thing left for us, though I will admit that my own sense of fear\r\nwas of such strength that my words were braver than myself.\r\n\r\nThe moon came out again and the forms of our guards grew more distinct,\r\nceasing to have the shadowy quality which at times in the last hour had\r\nmade them waver before me. Nevertheless, the light still served to\r\ndistort them and enlarge them to gigantic size, and my imagination gave\r\nfurther aid in the task.\r\n\r\nRedfield became silent again, and I thought he might be asleep, but when\r\nI looked at him I saw his eyes shining with the same unnatural light\r\nthat I had marked there before, and I felt with greater force than ever\r\nthat we must not long delay our attempt to leave the valley. But I\r\nremained for a while without movement or without thought of what we\r\nshould do. The belief that we had come there to be hunted by the\r\nsurvivors of the millions whom we had hunted out of existence became a\r\nconviction, and I felt a reluctance to meet the eyes of the avenging\r\nbeasts, eyes that I could always see with my imagination if not with my\r\nown gaze. The light of the moon struck fairly on the sides of the great\r\ncliffs and the grotesque and threatening faces which my fancy had carved\r\nthere in the rock lowered at us again. I could even distort the trees\r\ninto gigantic half-human shapes, leaning toward us and taunting us, but\r\nI shut my eyes and drove them away. I had not forgotten the curious\r\nlight gleaming in Redfield’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAn hour later I told Redfield that we must descend, that we could not\r\nstay forever where we were and it was foolish for us to delay, wearing\r\nout our strength and weakening our wills with so long and heavy a vigil.\r\nHe said no, that he would not stir while those beasts were there\r\nwatching; he could see a million red eyes all turned upon him and he\r\nknew that as soon as he touched the earth the owners of those eyes would\r\nrush upon him and trample him to death. I felt some of his own\r\nreluctance, but knowing that it was no time to waste words I told him\r\nthat he could stay where he was, if he chose, but I was going; I had\r\nseen enough of the valley and certainly I would never come near it\r\nagain. So speaking I began to descend the tree, and Redfield instantly\r\nbegan to tremble and beg me, like a child, not to go. He said he could\r\nnot be left there alone and he would not be for all the world.\r\nStrengthened in my purpose by his pleadings and believing that my method\r\nwould compel him to come I again bade him stay if he wished, it was\r\nnothing to me; but while I said these things I continued to descend.\r\nWhen he saw that I was in truth going he began to lower himself from his\r\ntree, though still begging me not to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nMy foot struck the ground and I stood there afraid, but resolute. Our\r\nguards still gazed at us but made no movement to attack, and I drew\r\ncourage from the fact.\r\n\r\nRedfield was shivering, and perhaps my own courage was not of the best,\r\nbut I pointed to a dark line in the face of a distant cliff where the\r\nmoonlight fell clearly, and asked if it were not the ravine by which we\r\nhad come. He said yes, and not giving him time to think and to hesitate\r\nabout it I seized him by the arm and pulled him on, telling him that we\r\nmust reach the ravine as quickly as we could and leave the valley. Then\r\nwe advanced directly toward that segment of the watchful circle which\r\nstood between us and the point we desired to reach.\r\n\r\nI retained my firm grasp upon Redfield’s arm and I felt the flesh\r\ntrembling under my fingers. We did not recall until long afterward that\r\nwe had forgotten our rifles. As we advanced, the line of buffaloes\r\nparted and we passed through it. Redfield cried out in childish delight\r\nand said they were afraid of us, but I shook him, more in anger than\r\nfrom any wiser motive, and hastened our steps. Fear rolled away from me\r\nand I felt an exhilaration that made me walk with buoyant step. I\r\ndropped my hand from Redfield’s arm and we walked on at a swift pace, my\r\neyes fixed on the dark line in the cliff which marked the ravine, our\r\navenue of escape from the valley. Redfield suddenly put his hand upon my\r\nshoulder and motioned me to look back. When I obeyed I saw the buffaloes\r\nfollowing us in a long line, as regular and even as a company of\r\nsoldiers. Redfield laughed in the mirthless way which marked him that\r\nnight and said we had an escort who would see that we did not linger in\r\nthe valley. I could not say that he was wrong, but I grew impatient with\r\nhim when he tried to make a jest of it and talked of our bodyguard. I\r\nknew that he was trembling, and I asked angrily, though not in words,\r\nwhy they could not let us alone. We were leaving as fast as we could,\r\nand as for coming back, nothing could drag me to that valley again; no,\r\nnothing, and I said the “nothing” aloud with angry emphasis.\r\n\r\nOur guard did not desert us, but followed at fifty or sixty yards with\r\nnoiseless step. And again I noticed that there was no other animal life\r\nin the valley, though the grass was green and the woods abundant, a\r\nplace that the birds and rabbits should love.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the pass grew more distinct, the tracery of bushes and\r\nvines that lined it was revealed, and in a few minutes we would arrive\r\nat the first slope. I felt like a criminal, a murderer, taken in\r\ndisgrace from the place of his crime, and this feeling once having\r\nseized me would not leave, but grew in strength and held me. Redfield\r\nwas my brother in crime, and certainly his face, his nerveless manner,\r\nshowed his guilt.\r\n\r\nI hastened my footsteps, eager to leave the place. Redfield kept pace\r\nwith me, and in silence we reached the first slope. It was a rugged and\r\ntoilsome ascent, but I thought little of such things, the joy of escape\r\nfrom the valley mastering all other emotions. A third of the way we\r\npaused, and, looking back, saw the silent line of sentinels watching at\r\nthe foot of the cliff, their eyes turned up at us.\r\n\r\nThen we resumed our ascent, and, reaching the top of the cliff, left the\r\nlost herd, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ISLES OF SCILLY.\r\n\r\n                       By James Henry Stevenson.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not visit The Scillies. Go to Penzance—a charming spot that has not\r\nreceived the attention from the tourist that it deserves—and see the\r\nhopeful passengers take ship in the morning for the “blessed isles;”\r\ninspect them again on their return in the evening; if you are still\r\ncurious go to Land’s End—a drive of eight or ten miles—and look across\r\nthe sea that lies between you and The Scillies; buy a guide book and a\r\nfew pictures when you come home, and bless your stars that you did not\r\ntempt the deep.\r\n\r\nThis is the advice which I vowed I would give, when, one day last\r\nsummer, for three awful hours I “hove” with the heaving deep. I am not\r\nusually a poor sailor. Indeed I have generally crossed the Atlantic\r\nwithout making my offering to the gods of the Abyss. Anything in reason\r\nI am prepared to do, but the demands of the little steamer that plies\r\nbetween the Islands and Penzance are altogether unreasonable.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning and Mount’s Bay, on which Penzance is so\r\npicturesquely situated, was as placid as a swimming tank, but I noticed\r\nthat the wind was blowing fresh from the southeast, and I mentally\r\nobserved that there was likely to be trouble when we rounded Land’s End.\r\nI am proud of that prophecy now, though trouble came sooner than I had\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nLong before we had lost the shelter of the rocky and fascinating coast\r\nthat girts the shores of Cornwall towards Land’s End, many a swain, who\r\nhad started off that morning with a light heart and “Arriet,” sadly\r\nadmitted that “all was vanity.”\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Land’s End I lost interest in the scenery and gave\r\nup—among other things—the unequal struggle. The “Lyonesse” was crowded\r\nand there was no place to lie down. Indeed one was fortunate to find a\r\nseat. I secured a camp stool and a vacant place in the gang-way, and as\r\nI watched, or rather was conscious of, the movements of our vessel, she\r\nseemed like a fabled sea monster sporting in the deep. Poised for a\r\nmoment jauntily on the wave’s crest, or plunging her nose beneath a huge\r\nbillow, she was equally happy. I called to mind the legend of the\r\nLyonesse, the continent that once stretched between Cornwall and the\r\nIsles of Scilly, and which in the days of “good king Arthur” sunk below\r\nthe deep at the command of Merlin, engulfing Mordred and his host as\r\nthey thundered hard after the remnant of the slain Arthur’s army. I\r\nthought of this and then I knew that our ship was trying to justify her\r\nhigh sounding title. Just at this moment she made a plunge towards the\r\nsunken continent and a huge wave swept in over the bow, most thoroughly\r\ndrenching a party of ambitious sightseers who were tempting Providence\r\non the ship’s nose. The wave rolled on towards me but I was too busy\r\njust at that moment to successfully evade it.\r\n\r\nAs we passed close by Land’s End I roused up for a moment to look at the\r\ncelebrated point and again as we came in sight of Woolf lighthouse, a\r\nsolitary sentinel in the waste of waters, midway between the mainland\r\nand the islands, and an eloquent witness for the Lyonesse legend.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, I can say I was conscious of existence, but not taking\r\nmuch interest in life, when a sudden cessation of the turmoil within and\r\nwithout re-awakened somewhat my torpid senses, and as we made fast to\r\nthe dock, I dragged myself ashore and followed the haggard and\r\nbedraggled passengers through a narrow street into the town. A short\r\nwalk brought me beyond the city to a grassy hillside, where, with my\r\ncamera for a pillow, having cast aside all literary and artistic\r\naspirations as worthless, I was soon blissfully unconscious of the\r\nbeauty and romance I had come so far and braved so much to see. In the\r\ncourse of an hour or so, I was awakened by a grazing horse on the alert\r\nfor something green, and, recollecting my mission, started forth to make\r\nthe tour of the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. MARY’S AND OLD TOWN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe landed, as a matter of course, at Hugh Town, St. Mary’s, the largest\r\nand most important island of the group, with Star Fort situated on its\r\neastern promontory, and Hugh Town on a narrow isthmus connecting this\r\npromontory with the main body of the island.\r\n\r\nAs I have already intimated, the first thing of interest to me, on\r\ncoming ashore, was a vacant bit of real estate wherein to lie down and\r\nforget my past. So, after shaking myself awake, I walked up a hill and\r\ncame in sight of the historic little church which is situated at the\r\nhead of the bay of Old Town, formerly the chief town of the island. The\r\nchurch, a very quaint old structure, stands in an enclosure which rises\r\nin successive terraces on the hillside and is filled with a striking\r\nmixture of English and tropical vegetation.\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting monuments in the churchyard, I noticed a\r\ngranite obelisk, erected by Mr. Holtzmaister of New York, to the memory\r\nof his wife, who perished in the wreck of the ill-fated S. S.\r\n_Schiller_, May 7, 1875. The inscription reads: “In memory of Louise\r\nHoltzmaister, born at New York, May 15th, 1851, who lost her life in the\r\nwreck of the S. S. _Schiller_ off the Scilly Isles, May the 7th, 1875.\r\nHer body rests in the deep. This monument has been erected to her memory\r\nas a mark of affection by her surviving husband.”\r\n\r\nThe memory fain would linger round some spot where the beloved take\r\ntheir last long sleep. Tennyson’s beautiful lines awaken a heartfelt\r\nresponse in every human breast:\r\n\r\n                                        “Oh to us\r\n              The fools of habit, sweeter seems\r\n                To rest beneath the clover sod,\r\n              That takes the sunshine and the rains,\r\n              Or where the kneeling hamlet drains\r\n                The chalice of the grapes of God,\r\n                Than if with thee the roaring wells\r\n              Should gulf him deep in fathom brine;\r\n              And hands so often clasped in mine\r\n                Should toss with tangle and with shells.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CHURCH AND THE TOMBS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe people of these islands have witnessed many a tragedy of the sea in\r\ntheir day, but perhaps none more awful than that which this monument\r\nrecalls. The _Schiller_, a staunch boat, built on the Clyde in 1873, was\r\nin command of Captain Thomas, an Englishman by birth, but then a\r\nnaturalized German. She left New York on the 27th of April with\r\nfifty-nine saloon, seventy-five second, and one hundred and twenty\r\nsteerage passengers. She was due at Plymouth on the 8th of May, but for\r\nthree days previous to the disaster no observations were obtained on\r\naccount of the weather. Early on Friday, the 7th, a heavy fog came down.\r\nCaptain Thompson, thinking he was near the islands, ordered the engines\r\nat half speed, but about 10 P.M. she ran on the Retarrier Ledges, near\r\nthe Island of St. Agnes. Few were in bed at the time of the accident;\r\nthe boats were quickly launched, the sailors behaved splendidly, but the\r\nsea was running high, and as the women and children crowded together\r\ninto the pavilion a heavy sea swept over it and carried all away. About\r\nforty-five out of three hundred and forty-five were saved. Mrs. Jones\r\nwas the only lady survivor. By Saturday evening seventy-eight bodies,\r\nnearly all with life-preservers on, had drifted ashore.\r\n\r\nThe old church, which is now restored and used only as a mortuary\r\nchapel, was originally built in the form of a cross. In 1662 it was\r\nenlarged. On each side of the communion table ran a long seat, the one\r\nfor the members of the Council and the other for their wives or the\r\nwidows of dead councilmen. In 1732 it was decreed that if a councilman\r\ndied, his wife was entitled to a seat among the wives of living\r\ncouncilmen during her widowhood, but if she married she was deprived of\r\nthat privilege, unless she married a councilman. This high esteem in\r\nwhich they held their women, and the fact that they used the church as a\r\ncouncil chamber, throw an instructive sidelight on the character of\r\nthese old representatives of the right of the people to govern\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE LOGAN ROCK.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe leave the quiet churchyard and its tragic story to continue our walk\r\naround the island. A tramp on the promontory Peninnis, which stretches\r\nout southward into the sea, brings to view many fantastic rock\r\nformations. Great boulders are left curiously poised upon each other by\r\nthe action of wind and wave in ages past. Pulpit Rock, composed of huge\r\nflat blocks of stone resting on each other and leaning out to sea, is\r\nperhaps the most famous, though why it should be called “Pulpit Rock” is\r\nmore than one can well guess. It looks more like an hundred other things\r\nthan it does like a pulpit. Most of all it resembles a great gun mounted\r\non the rock to command the sea at this point. We next encounter the\r\nLogan Rock (pronounce _loggan_). Everyone who has read Baedaker’s “Great\r\nBritain” knows of the existence of Logan Rock in Cornwall, a rock of\r\nsixty-five tons weight so delicately poised that it can be set in motion\r\nquite easily. I was not aware before that the phenomenon had repeated\r\nitself, but I learned last summer that there was quite a number of these\r\n“_loggan_,” or rolling rocks to be found at different places.\r\n\r\nThe Logan Rock at St. Mary’s is quite famous and was discovered somewhat\r\nrecently by accident. A resident of the town, overtaken by the storm,\r\ntook shelter beneath a huge rock. The wind was blowing fiercely and to\r\nhis great surprise, if not terror, he discovered that the rock was\r\nmoving gently to and fro. He could scarcely believe his senses at first,\r\nbut on further examination, he found it was so poised that it readily\r\nresponded to his efforts and could be made to sway back and forth. Its\r\nestimated weight is three hundred and sixty tons, and while it requires\r\nsome energetic effort to put it in motion it rocks with ease afterwards.\r\n\r\nHugh Town, the port and principal town of the island of St. Mary’s, and\r\nindeed of the entire group of islands, enjoys a very unique situation.\r\nOn the southwest a promontory juts out into the sea. This is the site of\r\nStar Fort, and one can make its circuit in about half an hour. It is\r\njoined to the mainland by a narrow isthmus of sand which separates St.\r\nMary’s Pool, the harbor on the north, from Porth Cressa Bay, on the\r\nsouth. On this narrow strip of land, across which a boy can cast a\r\nstone, and over which the high tide threatens to leap, Hugh Town is\r\nbuilt. There is no pretension to architecture, no striking buildings,\r\nnone even that have the interest of antiquity to recommend them. The\r\ntown is practically contained on the narrowest part of the isthmus,\r\nthough westward, where the strip of land widens, the houses scatter\r\nsomewhat. Save for its audacious situation, daring, as it does, the rage\r\nof the sea from both sides, it is commonplace and uninteresting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HUGH TOWN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nToo much cannot be said in favor of the islands as a health resort. They\r\nare so small in area, and lie so low, that living on them is practically\r\nliving at sea. One may here take a protracted cruise with no reeling\r\ndeck beneath him, and no nightmare of _mal-de-mer_ to threaten his\r\ndreaming hours.\r\n\r\nThere are no manufactures of any kind on the island, nor is anything\r\npresent to vitiate the air. Sea breezes, from the illimitable reaches of\r\nthe ocean, sweep at will across these tiny bits of land, from every\r\npoint of the compass, in quick succession. In winter the mean\r\ntemperature is 45 and in summer it is 58. The rain fall is very moderate\r\nand, with fine consideration for the tourist, the rain generally comes\r\nat night, a phenomenon noticeable in Cornwall also.\r\n\r\nHere is a fine resting place for men and women, physically or mentally\r\nweary. The rush of modern business life is wholly unknown; there are no\r\nstreet cars nor elevated trains to catch; there is no congestion of\r\ntraffic in the streets; no roar of vehicles nor hum of business to\r\ndisturb the absolute rest that the place suggests or to chide one who is\r\ndisposed to take life easy. One lies down at night with the murmur of\r\ndistant waters echoing through his dreams and wakens in the morning to\r\nthe song of the surf.\r\n\r\nThe islands are said to be a “haven of refuge for sufferers from chronic\r\nbronchitis, phthisis and consumption in all its terrible forms,\r\ninsomnia, and the strain of overwork; and for children one vast\r\nplayground with free and open beaches and sands difficult to surpass.”\r\n\r\nCertainly it would be hard to find a more ideal place for overworked\r\nhumanity seeking rest and recuperation. The climate is all that could be\r\ndesired, living is cheap, the whole atmosphere breathes rest, and there\r\nare ever present the constant sunshine and the eternal sea.\r\n\r\nOn St. Mary’s Sir Walter Besant lived while engaged on his celebrated\r\nromance, “Armorel of Lyonesse,” the home of whose beautiful Armorel Sir\r\nWalter located on the now uninhabited island of Samson. Half a century\r\nago Samson had a population of fifty souls, with ten houses, among which\r\n“Armorel’s cottage” may still be seen. In 1885, only one family was\r\nleft, and now nothing remains save the wreck of the houses and the\r\ntraces of former cultivation, rapidly disappearing. The inhabitants were\r\nmoved to other islands to insure the better education of their children,\r\nand, incidentally, to curtail a little private and untaxed trade which\r\nthey carried on with their French neighbors.\r\n\r\nTo trace the history of these fragments of a lost continent through\r\nformer generations would be most interesting, but it must be here\r\nforegone. They have, however, bulked considerably in English history and\r\nfigured frequently in her relations with her continental neighbors. They\r\nremained true to the royal cause after Charles I had been put to death,\r\nhaving been held by Sir John Grenville for Charles II. The garrison was\r\nreduced to submission by Ascue and Blake in 1651. Prince Charles was\r\nsheltered in Star Castle for a short while after his flight from\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nThe islands were notorious as the scenes of smuggling operations during\r\nthe eighteenth century, but this was so vigorously dealt with that it\r\nproved as unprofitable as the various honest efforts to earn a\r\nlivelihood that have been successively experimented with in this little\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Hamilco of Carthage, a colony of Phœnicia, discovered\r\nthe islands in 3000 B.C.; at any rate, they have been identified with\r\nthe Cassiterides or Hesperides of the Greeks, and the Sillinæ Insulæ of\r\nthe Romans. The Phœnicians traded with them for tin, which was most\r\nprobably brought from Cornwall, as there is no evidence that tin was\r\never found on the islands. An allusion in Diodorus Siculus throws light\r\non this custom. He says: The tin “was first refined and then carried to\r\nan adjacent island for shipment to Gaul.” The Romans reduced the islands\r\nduring their occupation of Great Britain and made them a place of\r\nbanishment, a use to which they were put by Great Britain also during\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Danish sea-kings found them a convenient rallying point for raids\r\nupon places in the Bristol Channel, but Athelstan drove the Danes out in\r\n927. Subsequently an order of monks settled there, retaining an\r\nindependent government till Henry I subordinated them to the Abbot of\r\nTavistock. Scilly remained under the jurisdiction of the monks till the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII. The ruins of\r\nan old abbey are still visible on the island of Tresco.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth, Sir Francis Godolphin built a number of\r\nforts and Star Castle near Hugh Town. The latter remains to the present,\r\non the left of the harbor, at Star Fort.\r\n\r\nWe have noted that the islands were used by both Romans and Britons as a\r\nplace of punishment, and we learn that in 1637 John Bastwick, M.D.,\r\nafter having been banished there for writing libelous books against\r\nchurch and government, was sentenced to pay a fine of £1,000, to stand\r\nin the pillory, to have his ears cut off, and finally to be confined in\r\nSt. Mary’s castle. After such a generous assignment the story of the\r\n“ducking chair” sounds like comedy. The offender guilty of some trifling\r\nmisdemeanor was tied in the chair at the head of the dock and thrown\r\ninto the water. One cannot help feeling that this would be fine\r\ntreatment for the American “hobo,” especially if the salt water was\r\navailable and it was not necessary to haul him out too soon.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants have had a hard fight for existence and have been on the\r\nverge of starvation more than once. Farming proved a failure. So\r\nlikewise did smuggling, shipbuilding, fishing, and other experiments,\r\nthat for a time seemed to promise success.\r\n\r\nNow, however, they are more prosperous than they have ever been. Early\r\npotatoes, asparagus, and other vegetables are raised in large quantities\r\nfor the English market. In this respect Scilly is to London what Bermuda\r\nis to New York. Besides the vegetables, flowers are cultivated for the\r\nLondon market, and grow in such luxuriant profusion as to guarantee a\r\nhandsome return to the gardener. Anyone who has seen an acre or two of\r\nlilies abloom in Bermuda knows what a glorious sight a field of flowers\r\nis. We cannot judge from a florist’s window how splendid is a flower\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nDuring Christmas week wallflowers, marguerites, daisies, narcissi,\r\nroses, pinks, marigolds, fuchsias, geraniums and chrysanthemums are\r\nfound in bloom.\r\n\r\nThe fields are divided off into little squares of about a quarter of an\r\nacre, by high hedges. Here the flowers are protected from the winds and\r\ncuddled up to the gracious sun. Under this nurture aloes attain a height\r\nof five or six feet, and in blossoming throw up a bloom-spike as high as\r\neighteen or twenty feet.\r\n\r\nAs London is distant from the islands only about eleven hours it follows\r\nthat if the inhabitants are prepared to supply the metropolis with its\r\nflowers and vegetables they may rest easy about “the wolf at the door.”\r\n\r\nThe islands number about forty, and are situated some twenty-seven miles\r\nwest of Land’s End. Five of them are inhabited, and the total\r\npopulation, which increased during the decade by one hundred and four,\r\nis some two thousand.\r\n\r\nAs we steamed out of the harbor a fleet of British war ships, twenty-two\r\nin number, was lying at anchor in the bay. When one reflects that these\r\nfighting machines are similarly in evidence in almost every harbor round\r\nthe world, he is convinced that Great Britain’s arm upon the sea is a\r\nsignificant factor to be reckoned with in questions relating to the\r\nworld’s peace.\r\n\r\nI met the captain of our ship as I stepped aboard and besought him,\r\nthough unbelief was regnant, to assure us of a smooth passage home. I\r\nexplained to him that I had contributed everything I possessed on the\r\nway hither and that since then I had been too busy sleeping and seeing\r\nthe island to replenish my larder. He replied with cordial good humor\r\nthat the return voyage would be pleasant. Of course I was sceptical, but\r\nto my great surprise, when we rounded the point where Star Fort is\r\nsituated, I saw at once that the ocean’s wrath was greatly appeased.\r\n\r\nTime heals most wounds, and, while she banishes to a merciful oblivion\r\nwhat is sad and unpleasant, she graciously leaves with us the undimmed\r\nvision of our happy days. Thus it is that I have forgotten the raging of\r\nthe sea and the tossing of the ship, and treasure the picture which that\r\nAugust morning brought me, “a small sweet world of wave-encompassed\r\nwonder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LABOR QUESTION.\r\n             WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SOUTHERN CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n                            By Herman Justi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The writer of the following pages is one of the recognized authorities\r\n  of the country on labor questions. Born in Kentucky about fifty-three\r\n  years ago, he has been in his time merchant, manufacturer, banker,\r\n  editor, traveler and sociologist. He lived in Tennessee for fifteen\r\n  years and since 1898 has been in Chicago. As commissioner of the\r\n  Illinois Coal Operators’ Association he has dealt with the perplexing\r\n  problems of labor face to face, and thus has been obliged to test\r\n  theory in the crucible of practice. Although a representative, in a\r\n  sense, of capital, he is the friend of organized labor and is so\r\n  recognized by its leaders.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Justi has contributed to the current discussions of economic\r\n  topics many valuable papers which have been printed in the leading\r\n  periodicals of the country and it is therefore felt that the following\r\n  paper, treating a question new to the South, but none the less, of\r\n  prime and growing importance, will be read with deep interest.—ED.\r\n\r\nIn almost every discussion of the labor problem practically the only\r\nclass of labor taken into consideration is that known as common labor—by\r\nwhich term is meant the labor that is grouped into large bodies. That\r\nlabor which is known in the North, East and West as common labor is\r\nsimilarly known in the South. Mill, mine and factory hands, workers on\r\nstreets and highways, employes in railway depots and on wharves are\r\neverywhere, for want of a better term, designated as common labor. In\r\nthis discussion no notice need be taken of highly skilled laborers who\r\ncan be safely classified among the crafts, and who are seldom found in\r\nconsiderable groups. The craftsmen can take care of themselves and need\r\nno union to protect them. They are treated, not like a commodity that\r\ncan be easily replaced by substitutes from an emigrant ship, but like\r\nintelligent human agents, who must be handled with care and respect.\r\n\r\nIn considering the general subject of labor with special reference to\r\nthe South, the question of labor in itself, while important, is not\r\ncomplicated with so many difficulties as confront us in the North; and\r\nyet the difficulties are many, and some of them, unless intelligently\r\ndealt with, may become serious.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the loss of the black man as a laborer at the South might\r\nprove a serious embarrassment, or the loss by the black man of\r\nconfidence in and respect for the white man’s authority, might\r\nnecessitate an admixture, by immigration, of races and nationalities\r\nwhich would push the black laborer to the wall, and should be avoided if\r\nit is possible to avoid it. To no one is this a matter of so much\r\nimportance as to the black man.\r\n\r\nThe labor problem at the North would be infinitely simpler if there were\r\nfewer nationalities, all of them speaking and understanding the English\r\ntongue. This statement does not imply that those speaking foreign\r\ntongues are necessarily inferior in character or intellect to the\r\nEnglish speaking laborer, but the troubles arise rather because the\r\nnon-English speaking laborers are the victims of deception by\r\nunscrupulous interpreters who purposely misrepresent what is said to\r\nthem for their benefit, or what is said by them to their employers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the black man speaks a language understood by the white\r\nman is a point in his favor, and that is also a reason why he should\r\ncontinue to be the most desirable common laborer obtainable. The negro\r\nat the North is discriminated against in all labor organizations as well\r\nas in every relation of life, but in the South he still has a fair\r\nchance to market his labor, if he will avail himself of it and will\r\nrealize his opportunity. So far the very abundance of cheap common labor\r\nin the South has hindered the growth of the labor union there and has in\r\nmany instances defeated its purposes when established. The want of\r\nambition, which makes the negro content with low wages and inferior\r\nconditions of living, is sometimes found in common labor at the North,\r\nbut it is by no means so general as among the black race in the South.\r\nParticularly is this the case in the cities, to which the negroes have\r\nflocked in great numbers, denuding the plantations of needed help while,\r\nin the cities, holding down the wages of common labor,—the only labor in\r\nwhich the negro competition has yet been apparent. The employers of\r\nlabor in the South should do everything in their power to make of the\r\nblack man all that it is possible to make of him as a laborer; but, as\r\nhe has his limitations and as the black man will at times leave the\r\nSouth and so leave an opening for new white labor, the South must use\r\nher energies to educate this newly acquired immigrant labor up to\r\nAmerican standards—and no work that it can do will bring greater returns\r\nthan teaching the non-English laborer the language of his newly adopted\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that union or organized labor is not strong in the South,\r\nwhen compared with the average sections of the North, gives the employer\r\nclass in the South an opportunity which they may and should utilize in\r\npreparing for that time when the contests incident to organization are\r\nsure to come. And in this preparation they want to bear in mind the\r\nundeniable truth that the quality of the laborer is generally determined\r\nby the quality of the employer. In considering the capacity of any body\r\nof laborers we are unfailingly considering the capacity and intelligence\r\nof the employers in directing their employes. Employer and employe alike\r\nhave splendid opportunities opening to them in the South, opportunities\r\nin many respects unrivalled; and it is of the highest importance that\r\nthey make a right beginning and understand each other at the start. The\r\nunion will indubitably grow, and the employer should welcome it if it\r\npresents itself as a business body seeking the highest wages compatible\r\nwith commercial or competitive conditions in return for the best\r\nservices of which the labor offered is capable.\r\n\r\nBut in the South labor must come with reason in its request. It need not\r\nbe servile, but it must be respectful, for it is still, as it has always\r\nbeen, characteristic of the people of the South that they will brook no\r\ninterference with their individual liberty. The North does not, and\r\nnever did, understand the strength of this underlying principle of\r\nSouthern manhood. It is a principle so strong that it does not disappear\r\nin a single generation.\r\n\r\nA notable instance of this was seen in a recent dispute over the mining\r\nscale in Franklin County, Illinois. The southern part of Illinois was\r\nsettled by Southerners, mainly by Tennesseans and Kentuckians, who\r\npoured into that rich country for a few years before the war and for a\r\nfew years afterwards. There are whole communities now dominated by\r\nSouthern thought and principles. When the miners’ union was seeking to\r\nestablish itself in Franklin County, these farmers, either of Southern\r\nbirth or of Southern ancestry, having heard that the representatives of\r\nthe miners, whom they described as agitators, were undertaking to\r\ninterfere with the individual rights of their sons to work without\r\ndictation from any one, offered their services to the newly established\r\ncompanies. The newly established companies, however, politely declined\r\nthe proffered assistance, preferring peaceable adjustment. But the\r\ntendered services would have been given just as willingly as they were\r\ntendered.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed in the North is also needed in the South; namely, wise\r\nand well informed teachers who are able to illumine the great problem of\r\nlabor to the masses, in order that they may distinguish between anarchy\r\nor socialism on the one hand and the accepted political principles of\r\nour country on the other. But there is one thing to be truly said about\r\nthe South that will always commend itself to employers contemplating a\r\nchange of base or the establishment of themselves for the first time—and\r\nit will commend itself to labor whether organized or unorganized—and\r\nthat is the doctrines of the socialist have found no encouragement\r\nthere. Such doctrines cannot thrive in the South any more than tropical\r\nplants can survive in the polar regions. Labor leaders should rejoice—in\r\nfact wise, educated, far-seeing labor leaders do rejoice—that this\r\nspirit prevails in the South, for only so can they hold their own\r\nagainst the radical, trouble-making element in their own ranks.\r\n\r\nThinking too much of established institutions and guarding them too\r\nzealously may at times be a disadvantage, but as a general thing that\r\ncommunity is most law-abiding and most conservative in maintaining the\r\nrights and privileges of all where due reverence is cherished for old\r\nestablished institutions; and yet the wisest conservatism is that which\r\nsteadily, no matter how slowly, prepares itself for changes that are\r\ninevitable. Labor conditions in the South cannot endure as they now\r\nexist, unless the South is to lose all that she has gained since the\r\noverthrow of slavery, and is to stand and view the triumphal march of\r\nthe country without participating in it.\r\n\r\nThe South should not seek to rest under present conditions for they\r\ncannot continue. If the present labor of the South becomes educated and\r\nthen improves, it will organize. And if it does not improve, new labor\r\nwill come in either already organized or to organize immediately on its\r\narrival. I know this view will be contested by many able employers, but,\r\nbelieving it to be true, I deem it best to say it. It is a great deal\r\nbetter to make yourself strong so that you may trust in your strength\r\nwhen the certain change comes than to rely upon the fairness of the\r\nother side—and this is equally true of the employer and the employe.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught the South much on the question of labor, but so\r\nfar as a thorough understanding of the matter goes, the South is barely\r\nat the threshold. The first and greatest thing that the South has to\r\nrealize, which as yet is not realized there at all, is this: In the\r\nSouth as elsewhere, it will be found that cheap labor is the most\r\nexpensive. To secure good results is the desired end of all industry and\r\nthe experience of older industrial communities has taught that the best\r\nresults are, have been, and will ever be obtained by the employment of\r\nthe best labor. The best labor is and will always be that labor which\r\nreceives the highest wages and which is most nearly satisfied with\r\nsurrounding conditions. We can therefore set ourselves no more important\r\ntask, no more sacred duty, than that of finding the most nearly perfect\r\nsystem under which the highest wages can be paid in return for the most\r\nefficient service. And, aside from the justice of this course, aside\r\nfrom the material benefit to the employer, there is no investment that\r\nbrings its returns so quickly to the community at large, as money paid\r\nfor good labor. Money so paid is at once spent for the necessities of\r\nlife, for all the comforts that can be afforded by the family receiving\r\nit, and so is circulated almost automatically.\r\n\r\nLabor organizations have made small headway in the South for other\r\nreasons than the preponderance of negro cheap labor; the first to be\r\nstated being the advantages of climate and of cheap living possessed by\r\nthe Southern worker. The winters are short, the summers long. Outdoor\r\nvocations can be pursued in comparative comfort almost the entire year.\r\nFuel bills are smaller, the cost of clothing less, and the cheapness of\r\nland opens the way for the workman of even moderate means to possess his\r\nown home, if frugal and industrious. He can be his own landlord on\r\neasier terms than in the North. But on the other hand, while the\r\nclimatic and other conditions favor the workman of the South, it must\r\nalso be remembered that the housing of workmen in the sparsely settled\r\ncommunities or in mining camps is not as good as in the North where\r\nlegislation and the agitation of the labor leaders have brought about\r\ngreatly improved conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the cities of the North the conditions and surroundings of the\r\nworkmen are even more noticeably superior to those of the workmen in\r\nSouthern cities. The comforts of such flats as workingmen occupy in the\r\nlarge cities of the North, notably in Chicago, are practically, if not\r\naltogether, unknown in the South, where conveniences are fewer. This\r\nvery custom of living without comforts and conveniences has operated to\r\nkeep wages down and consequently to offer a check to the spread of\r\nunionism. The homes of many skilled Northern workmen belonging to the\r\nunion would be a revelation to the workman in the South equally skilled\r\nbut not a member of any labor organization, and receiving less pay for\r\nhis services.\r\n\r\nThe organization of labor in the South has also proceeded more slowly as\r\ncompared with the North because of the more rapid growth and development\r\nof the North. It is a fact at once apparent that cities where the unions\r\nare strong are the cities that are growing most rapidly. Another cause\r\nis the scarcity of manufacturing interests in the South and the\r\nconsequent small demand for skilled workmen, who are therefore not in\r\nthe South in sufficient number to organize effectively against the mass\r\nof unskilled and partly skilled labor. The lack of numerous large\r\nmanufacturing enterprises, and of enormous mercantile interests, also\r\ncauses a lack of sharpness in competition and has made employes less\r\nready or able to exact the utmost that could be paid them in wages.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of organizing labor in the South are such as always\r\nmark the initial efforts at organization. The union men are out of the\r\nAlabama mines, just at this time, for instance, and new men have their\r\nplaces. The new men are being trained to their work, and are receiving\r\npractically, if not exactly, the wages asked for by the union. As the\r\nnumber of these skilled workmen increases, the necessity of organization\r\nwill become more apparent to them all, and the larger the number of men\r\ntrained for the work, the more effective the union will become. The\r\nunion wins victories for others oftentimes where it is itself nominally\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nThe question is asked, and with propriety, of the leaders of organized\r\nlabor, why it is, if organized labor offers or promises the best\r\nworkmen, that employers constantly resist its encroachment and turn it\r\nout and replace it with unorganized labor if they can. There are several\r\nreasons why this is so. It is not, as the labor leader frequently\r\nanswers, because the employer is short-sighted and imagines that when he\r\ncan get cheap labor he is making money, although it is at times due to\r\nthe want of discernment and enlightenment on the part of the employer.\r\nThe objection made to organized labor by its very best friends among the\r\nemployers is the short-sighted policy of the organization in winking at\r\nor permitting the well-known tyranny of the unions, and also that air of\r\nproprietorship which petty labor leaders so often assume.\r\n\r\nI have never denied the right of labor to organize, nor can I deny the\r\nnecessity for labor to organize; and, in the very nature of things, it\r\nseems to me that it is best that capital deal with labor as a unit. But\r\nat the same time I have, in pursuing my duties in adjusting labor\r\ndisputes, been brought in contact with labor leaders here and there\r\nwhose insolence and arrogance, whose absurd claim of being labor’s\r\nunselfish and only friend,—made me wish the whole world of organized\r\nlaborers and their leaders at the bottom of the sea. More than one true\r\nfriend of organized labor has been lost to a worthy and noble cause for\r\nno other reason than that they have been grossly offended and outraged\r\nby unworthy representatives of labor organizations.\r\n\r\nWhile the slow growth of the union in the South is no doubt a\r\ndiscouragement to labor organizations, it is a benefit to labor in the\r\nlong run. It is also at the same time an advantage to capital that labor\r\nis being slowly organized. Looking to the future it is an advantage both\r\nto capital and labor that the growth of the labor organization does not\r\ngo too far in advance of the education of the laboring classes and that\r\nthe employer class may, if it has an eye to its own interest, organize\r\nin order successfully and intelligently to treat with organized labor\r\nwhen it has become a force to be dealt with in the South.\r\n\r\nExperience proves that even the most thoroughly organized labor unions\r\nare not all-powerful when the employers stand together, and the\r\nparamount importance of organization among the employers has been\r\nrepeatedly demonstrated. When this organization of the employers shall\r\nhave been effected, inquiry into cause and effect, careful study of the\r\nlabor problem, will quickly show the great advantage and profitableness\r\nof dealing fairly with labor. It will show that, if the employers are\r\nloyal to each other, and if they have an organization in which all of\r\nits members have confidence, they, whether dealing with organized or\r\nunorganized labor, are certain to obtain their approximate rights. The\r\nmany labor tangles in which the country has at times been involved were\r\ndue far more to the disorganized condition of the employer class than to\r\nthe cohesiveness and power of the labor class. Whenever the labor class\r\nhas become needlessly strong and where it practices tyranny and\r\noppression, there the employer class will be found to have neglected its\r\nduty to itself.\r\n\r\nAnother result of the study of conditions will be that the employer\r\nclass will decide to be fair in dealing with labor, because in the long\r\nrun it will bring the largest dividends. This cannot be accomplished by\r\ndealing with unorganized labor, where the employers have the whole\r\nmatter practically under their own control, and thinking only of\r\nimmediate returns, will, consciously or unconsciously, take advantage of\r\nthe worker. Dealing with organized labor is not only more satisfactory,\r\nbut it is more profitable in its ultimate results.\r\n\r\nThe question of individual rights has had a large part in Southern labor\r\ntroubles. It was a question of the employer’s right to manage his\r\nproperty for himself in his own way that defeated an almost universal\r\nstrike of the Nashville Street Railway employes two or three years ago.\r\nThe union was formed and made its demands. The management declined to\r\nrecognize the union or to grant the demands, and successfully resisted\r\nthe resulting strike. But the management, I am informed, gave careful\r\nexamination to the facts thus brought to their attention and has\r\nvoluntarily advanced wages and improved conditions to a point far beyond\r\nwhat was formulated in the union’s demands. There is no union of the\r\nstreet railway’s employes now at Nashville, and so long as the present\r\nintelligent and progressive policy is pursued there will be none and\r\nthere will be none needed. Indeed, the only excuse for labor to organize\r\nis that the policy of the employer has too often been unintelligent,\r\nunprogressive and not in sympathy with the reasonable rights and needs\r\nof labor.\r\n\r\nBut the organization of labor and the advancement of wages will do more\r\nthan any other one thing to lend confidence to those who are looking to\r\nthe South as a field for investment. The Northern capitalist and\r\ninvestor cannot be made to believe that labor as good and efficient as\r\nNorthern labor will remain unorganized and render its service for\r\none-third or one-half of what the Northern workman receives. Nor does\r\nthe Southern worker have the same incentive to the high efficiency\r\nreached by the Northern workman. One of the most serious mistakes made\r\nby many Southern communities in presenting to the Northern investor the\r\nadvantages at the South is that they put emphasis on the fact that\r\nskilled and unskilled labor is “cheap.” Cheap labor that is at the same\r\ntime efficient is an unknown thing in the North, and Northern men who\r\nare familiar with the labor question will not believe that it exists in\r\nthe South. “If it were as efficient, it would be as well paid,” they\r\nsay. The proffer of “cheap” labor has done much to retard the industrial\r\ndevelopment of the Southern states. It is now the universal cry among\r\nthe employers of the North, particularly among those who oppose\r\norganized labor, that they are willing to pay and do pay the highest\r\nwages anywhere obtainable and that they are willing to afford and do\r\nafford to their employees the most favorable working conditions.\r\n\r\nThe question of child labor is one which must be determined by humane\r\nprinciples, and yet it is a question on which much fanaticism has been\r\nexpended and much maudlin sentiment indulged. The child develops earlier\r\nin the South, where the average boy of fourteen is as mature as the\r\naverage boy of sixteen in the North. It is a cause for gratification, a\r\nfact to the credit of the South, that recent child labor laws have\r\nremoved from mills and mines and factories a vast army of child laborers\r\nwho properly belonged in the nursery or at school. It was the South’s\r\nshame that they were ever permitted there under conditions once\r\nexisting, and still existing to a degree.\r\n\r\nBut, while believing that the question of child labor should be closely\r\nstudied and the interest of the child guarded, I know that this is not\r\nalways accomplished in the case of boys by making it an offense\r\npunishable by fine and imprisonment to keep boys of thirteen and\r\nfourteen years at work, particularly since in certain classes of society\r\nthey have no idea of continuing at school after they reach that age.\r\nAnything is better than idleness. It is a thousand to one better for a\r\nboy of twelve to be at work in mine, factory or mill than to be allowed\r\nto remain unemployed and unoccupied. If he is to be forced out of\r\nemployment, then provision must be made to force him into school. The\r\nattention that has been drawn to child labor in the South comes about\r\nnot so much by the efforts of philanthropists, not so much by the work\r\nof earnest students, as by that class of employers in New England who\r\nformerly employed children of tender years, but who were forced to\r\ndesist as the result of legislation, and who for this reason, and not\r\nfrom any high motives, directed attention to child labor in the cotton\r\nmills of the South. I do not mean to justify what is injurious to the\r\nchildren, but in considering this whole question trade or competitive\r\nconditions cannot be wholly ignored. We know that the advocates of child\r\nlabor laws are often selfishly influenced and that they aim to reduce\r\nthe army of workers in the hope thereby to monopolize labor as far as\r\npossible. It is often for the same selfish reason that the hours of\r\nlabor are restricted.\r\n\r\nMuch of the opposition to child labor has undoubtedly been removed by\r\nthe course of mill owners in the South, such as the Eagle and Phœnix\r\nmills at Columbus, Ga., the Unity Cotton Mills at Lagrange, Ga., and\r\nmills in Guilford County, N. C., and Pelzer, S. C. In these the children\r\nare required to spend a certain portion of their time in schools ranging\r\nfrom kindergartens to industrial training schools, which are supported\r\nmainly,—and in many cases altogether,—by the cotton mills themselves.\r\nThe press and pulpit unite in saying that in those mills many of the\r\nchildren have much better facilities for improvement than they had\r\nbefore their parents left the farms and brought them to the mills.\r\n\r\nThe South suffers from poorly paid labor, and continues to suffer\r\ndespite the fact that conditions are such as make it possible for her to\r\npay higher prices without injuriously affecting any of her industries.\r\nAs the wealth of the world increases the individual wants more and\r\ngreater conveniences, and more and more grows the demand for excellence\r\nrather than cheapness to be the chief consideration. The era of\r\ncheapness is on the decline; the product of mill and factory, of shop\r\nand lathe and hand, must be better to-day to be satisfying than at any\r\ntime in the world’s history. While excellence is sought the more,\r\ncheapness is laughed at and passed by.\r\n\r\nThe Southern states are in an enviable position to-day. The South ought\r\nto produce nearly all it consumes, and those things it can economically\r\nproduce for its own consumption it should certainly be able to sell in\r\nMexican and South American markets in successful competition with the\r\nrest of the world. How successfully this can be done will depend upon\r\nthe ability of the South to produce the best goods for the least money,\r\nand it can only do this provided its labor is the best. But its labor\r\ncannot be the best unless it is paid the highest wages and is afforded\r\nthe most satisfactory conditions under which the workmen can perform\r\ntheir services, and under which they and their families can live.\r\n\r\nWhen labor is once organized on business lines and is a fair competitor\r\nof unorganized labor, it will not only be the successful competitor but\r\nwill furnish the best labor obtainable. Nowhere has organized labor\r\nunder such conditions so fine an opportunity or so fair a chance as in\r\nthe South. But as I said before, the South is the stronghold of\r\nindividual rights. The workman must respect the individual rights of the\r\nemployer and the employer in return will respect the individual rights\r\nof the workman.\r\n\r\nIt is not only skilled, law-abiding laborers that are necessary to the\r\nSouth’s industrial success, but it is first of all necessary that\r\nemployers be enlightened and abreast of the times in order that they may\r\nsee clearly what their rivals are doing and what the markets of the\r\nworld require. And chiefly employers must be just, wise and humane in\r\norder that they may enjoy the confidence and respect of their men.\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that wherever there are employers who are wise and\r\nhumane, working in harmony with laborers who are skilled, frugal and\r\nlaw-abiding, the community where the combination is found has a sure\r\nguaranty of numerical growth and of substantial material prosperity.\r\nGrowth in population is gratifying to most citizens, notably so when\r\naccompanied with industrial growth as well, but substantial and lasting\r\nprosperity has too often been sacrificed in the eager desire of one\r\ncommunity to herald to the world a larger population than its rival\r\npossessed. Increased numbers and wealth—if they bring in their train an\r\nunnatural increase in vice and crime, as we too often find to be the\r\ncase,—are infinitely worse than if there were no growth. Southerners\r\nsometimes lament that the South does not grow fast enough, yet that it\r\nmakes haste slowly is the South’s good fortune, since the criminal\r\nclasses have not increased with the population as at the North. The\r\nSouthern people, conservative always, should be in nothing so\r\nconservative as in the determination that this shall still be true; that\r\nwhile it is increasing in population and wealth the South shall also\r\naccomplish the more difficult and important duty of diminishing the\r\npercentage of vice and crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TILDY BINFORD’S ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n                           By Holland Wright.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advertising agent had done his worst. He had subsidized the county\r\npaper, crowding out valuable editorials to make room for pictures of the\r\nyawning hippopotamus and the unconventional summer girl. Every barn\r\nwithin five miles was decorated with big red pictures and big black\r\nletters, all telling of the wonders exhibited by the Grand Combination\r\nof Railroad Circuses.\r\n\r\nHodges was but an advertising agent—a ruthless purveyor of publicity.\r\nCallous to æsthetic emotions, blind to the beauties of nature, his\r\nconscience was dead to the vandalism of highway advertising. Having\r\nbedaubed the smiling face of nature in the vicinity of Johnsonville, he\r\nwas ready to advance on Jonesboro.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” he said, stepping briskly into Elrod’s livery stable, “have you\r\ngot a team that can snatch me into Jonesboro in four hours?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what we have,” said old Bill Elrod—“Truthful Bill,” the\r\nboys called him.\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean exactly what I say,” said Hodges. “Exactly four hours. I\r\nknow it’s a hard drive, and I’m willing to pay a dollar or two extra if\r\nyou can do it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, stranger,” said Truthful. “You’ve come to the right\r\nplace. I’ve got a pair of plugs that can put you there to the minute.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hitch ’em up,” said Hodges. “I’ve got no time to spare.”\r\n\r\nOld Elrod called to a stable boy to harness the grays, while he went out\r\nto get old Eli Wetherford to drive. He took Eli off into a corner of the\r\nblacksmith shop, to give him his instructions.\r\n\r\n“See here, Eli, that lunatic of a bill-poster wants to be took to\r\nJonesboro in four hours.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Eli, “it’ll take ever’ minute of six hours to make the\r\ntrip, but if he’s dead set on doin’ it in four, you’d better give him\r\nall kinds of encouragement. If he goes over to see Hopkins & Brown,\r\nthey’ll agree to put him through in twenty minutes.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ’tend to that,” said Truthful. “I want you to drive him. If I send\r\na boy, that feller will hustle him along fast enough to kill my horses,\r\nin spite of all I can do. Now I want you to take him and dash away with\r\nhim like you was goin’ for a doctor. When you git to the first\r\ntoll-gate, you can be talkin’ so fast he won’t think about the time o’\r\nday no more till he hears the town clock strike in Jonesboro.”\r\n\r\n“Jerusalem!” said Eli: “I ain’t no funnygraph, to be talkin’ a man blind\r\nfor six hours on a stretch.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ll make it easy enough,” said Truthful. “I’ll put a pint of\r\ngood liquor under the seat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now,” said Eli, persuasively, “if you could just make it a quart,\r\nso the stranger can take a nip now and then, it would encourage him\r\npowerful.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Elrod. “I’ll put in a full quart of the best in town.\r\nAnd say, Eli, try to make up some yarn about advertisin’. The hotel\r\nclerk says this looney ain’t interested in nothin’ else.”\r\n\r\nThus it happened that when they passed the tollgate, old Eli, who is a\r\nbachelor, was telling Hodges of an imaginary wife, who kept him poor by\r\nreading advertisements and buying patent medicines.\r\n\r\n“I do believe,” he said, “my old woman would have a fit any day if she\r\nshould happen to read a double-column advertisement of a real good fit\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of advertisement does she seem to like best?” asked Hodges.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” said Eli, “they ain’t a blessed thing the matter with\r\nher, so she likes advertisements that calls for ever’-day symptoms—You\r\nknow some advertisements says if it makes you dizzy to stan’ on your\r\nhead fifteen minutes, and if you feel warm in the summer time and cold\r\nin winter, you’ve got the very ailment that their bitters’ll cure. Ever’\r\ntime she sees a advertisement of that kind it costs old Eli a dollar,”\r\nand the indulgent husband of the extravagant hypochondriac solaced\r\nhimself with a dose of his own favorite prescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “Try to make up some yarn about advertisin’.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen they were half way to Jonesboro, they met Hank Binford, and Eli\r\nthought it would add some personal interest to a romance he had in mind\r\nto make Hank its hero. True, the hero must have a wife and a comfortable\r\nfortune, while Hank had neither, but that was immaterial, as the\r\nlistener was a stranger in a strange land.\r\n\r\n“Notice that feller we jest passed? That’s Hank Binford. He’s one of our\r\nleadin’ citizens. Owns half the houses in town, and a fine\r\nfour-hundred-acre farm in the river bottom. Well, sir, when he married,\r\nfive years ago, he didn’t own two shirts, and he was drunk half of the\r\ntime. It’s a strange thing, but one little four dollar advertisement\r\nchanged him into a prosperous citizen, with money in the bank.”\r\n\r\n“Must have been a pretty good ad. Tell me about it,” said Hodges,\r\nmoistening his lips with a half pint of whiskey, and settling down\r\ncomfortably to listen.\r\n\r\nEli took a long pull at the bottle, and began his story. Even with the\r\nbottle of inspiration at his elbow, he could not expect to invent his\r\nstory quite as fast as he could talk, so he told it with due\r\ndeliberation and great impressiveness.\r\n\r\n“When Tildy Maclin married Hank Binford, her folks all said if she\r\ndidn’t have no more sense than to tie to such a drinkin’, gamblin’ cuss,\r\nshe would deserve all she got, and mighty apt to git all she deserved.\r\nTildy said Hank would settle down and do all right, and the other\r\nMaclins all predicted, mighty confident, that he’d do all wrong. Well,\r\nsir, I never did perfess to be no prophet, so naturally of course I\r\ncouldn’t foresee in advance just what Tildy would make out of Hank. It\r\nappeared to me he might turn out as well as Tildy expected, or full as\r\nbad as her folks hoped, and neither way, it needn’t surprise nobody that\r\nknows what a powerful sight of human nature there is in a average man.\r\n\r\n“Well, Tildy she managed to keep Hank tolerable straight for about a\r\nyear. He’d go for months without so much as takin’ a dram, and when he\r\ndid start in for a spree she always managed to git him straight before\r\nhe could manage to git plum heedless drunk, and it begun to look like\r\nshe had him safe, and would finally land him in old Rehoboth church.\r\n\r\n“But, as I was sayin’, you can’t most always tell for certain just what\r\na man critter is goin’ to do, so I wasn’t overly surprised to hear, one\r\nday, that Hank had took advantage of Tildy’s visit to her Wilson County\r\nkin, and had filled up with red liquor, and was down to Ike Denman’s\r\ngrocery playin’ poker with Eb Wetherford and Eli Scoggins and Devil Bill\r\nAnderson. That is to say, Hank thought he was playin’, though in reality\r\nhe was only bein’ played; him bein’ plum drunk and the other boys\r\ntolerable sober. One or two of Hank’s friends had dropped in, kinder\r\nincidentally, and tried to steer him outside, but of course they didn’t\r\nhave no luck. ’Long about sundown, next day, I saw Tildy drive up to her\r\ngate and ’light, and in about a pair of minutes Miss Sallie Kate\r\nSlemmons followed her in, lookin’ powerful pleased, and I didn’t feel no\r\nsort of uneasiness but what Tildy would hear the news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bill just went sailin’ down the road with a armful of ’em, a-strowin’\r\n    ’em to the wind.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Well, early Saturday mornin’ I happened to be goin’ right by the\r\ngrocery, and I thought I’d jest step in and pass the time o’ day with\r\nIke, seein’ as I wasn’t in no particular rush. I found Ike all alone by\r\nhisself, and he invited me to have somethin’, and I excused myself at\r\nfirst, as men will, and after a while I inquired if the game was still\r\non, and what was the prospects for Hank to lose out, and go home and see\r\nTildy, and hear all about his Wilson County kin folks. Ike said he\r\nhadn’t kept the run of the game and didn’t know how Hank stood, but he\r\nseemed to imagine that Hank wasn’t in no swivet to swap news with Tildy.\r\n\r\n“Ike said Bunk Wetherford had come in early Friday night and took Eb\r\nhome, and for a while it looked like the game was broke up; but Eli had\r\nbantered one of the Edwards boys to take Eb’s place, and he went up and\r\ntook a hand, and the game broke out in a fresh place, and at last\r\naccounts, looked like it might last till all the spots was wore off the\r\ncards. I told Ike I’d go up and advise Hank that Tildy had come home.\r\n\r\n“‘All right,’ says he, ‘walk right up. I don’t git no takeout from the\r\ngame, and I’m more’n willin’ to see it broke up any time. I don’t like\r\nto interfere myself, jest because it would look like the boys wasn’t\r\nwelcome here, so I jest lets ’em do mostly as they like, so long as they\r\npays for what they gits, and don’t break nothin’.’\r\n\r\n“So I went up and looked on a while, and tried to ketch Hank’s eye, but\r\nI could see ’twas no use. He was feelin’ his licker, and talkin’\r\npowerful smart, and losin’ good hard-earned money just as cheerful as if\r\nmoney growed on trees and he owned all the timber land. After a while\r\nDenman come up to the head of the stairs, a-grinnin’ all over his face,\r\nand motioned me to come to the door. I went over and he handed me a\r\nprinted poster, about two foot square, and containin’ the followin’\r\nadvertisement in big, black type:\r\n\r\n                        ‘LOST, STRAYED OR STOLEN:\r\n                              ONE YOUNG MAN!\r\n\r\n    About 28 years old, 5 ft. 10 in. High, Weighs about 140 lbs., Tow\r\n Headed, Sandy Complected, Weak-eyed, and When Sober answers to the name\r\n                                    of\r\n\r\n                              HANK BINFORD!\r\n\r\n   $4 reward will be paid for his return in good order, Securely Tied.\r\n\r\n                         Signed: TILDY BINFORD.’\r\n\r\n“‘Gee Whilikins!’ says I; ‘where did you find it?’\r\n\r\n“‘Didn’t find it,’ says he. ‘Jest picked it up. Old man _Weekly Clarion_\r\nJohnson’s little boy, Bill, jest went sailin’ down the road with a\r\narmful of ’em, a-strowin’ ’em to the wind. The whole settlement’s full\r\nof ’em. They’re all over the floor downstairs, and all over the road,\r\nfur as you can see in both directions.’\r\n\r\n“The boys at the table was so set on the game that they didn’t take no\r\nnotice of me and Ike, till I steps over, while Hank was tryin’ to\r\nshuffle the cards, and lays the paper down right plum in the middle of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“‘Take the blame thing away,’ says Hank, without readin’ a word.\r\n\r\n“‘Read it,’ says I.\r\n\r\n“‘Read nothin!’ says he. ‘This is no literary society. Take the blasted\r\nthing out of the way so I can deal the kyards.’\r\n\r\n“‘I see your name on it,’ says I, ‘and I thought it might interest you.’\r\n\r\n“Hank laid down the cards and glanced over the paper. * * First he\r\nlooked kinder dazed. Then he picked the thing up and looked at it a long\r\ntime. His face got mighty white, and I thought he was goin’ to faint,\r\nbut he didn’t. He looked around at the boys; all of ’em a-grinnin’ and\r\nlookin’ tickled to death. I begins to have my suspicions about the\r\nmeanin’ of that white look on his face, and I steps back and takes a\r\nstand nigh the door. It was mighty plain to me that Hank had misery to\r\nspare, and he meant to pass it around promiscuous. He come up with his\r\nchair, and before them grinnin’ idiots had time to back off from the\r\ntable and climb out of their chairs, Hank had raised a knot on every\r\nhead, and started ’round the circuit to repeat the dose. They closed in\r\non him and mauled him and gouged him till you couldn’t tell who he was,\r\nonly by the familiar cut of his clothes and the complexion of his hair\r\nand moustache. The only way we could know for certain it was Hank, was\r\nby takin’ a sort of inventory of them that could be identified. As none\r\nof the whole men was Hank, it stood to reason that this remnant must be\r\nhim. It was also observed that the critter had a voice some like Hank’s,\r\nand used his favorite cuss words quite familiar like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  There ain’t nobody in the settlement that will go out of his way to\r\n    have a difficulty with Ike.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Now, endurin’ of the row, Devil Bill Anderson had received a tremenjous\r\nbig lump on his head, which he could not recall that he had done any\r\novert act or said any word to justify any human man to hit him that\r\nvengeful lick, and he was by no means satisfied. The more he thought\r\nover the details and narrated the circumstances, the more rebellious he\r\nfelt and the louder he talked; insomuch that it finally became necessary\r\nfor Denman to assert hisself and preserve order in his own grocery;\r\nwhich he finally said, quite emphatic, that if anybody wanted to hurt\r\nanybody, they might try their hand on Ike Denman. Now there ain’t nobody\r\nin the settlement that will go out of the way to have a difficulty with\r\nIke; so Devil Bill kinder cooled off, the best way he could, and\r\neverything got quiet, and Denman poured a big sluice of raw whiskey into\r\nHank, and put him to sleep under the big tree at the back of the\r\ngrocery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tildy came out to the gate, looking a little pale, but holding her\r\n    head up.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“I went to dinner, and when I got back Bud Runnels had just come up and\r\nwas readin’ Tildy’s advertisement. Bud always did love to joke, and this\r\none seemed to tickle him all over. After inquirin’ all about the\r\nparticulars, he asked where Hank was at.\r\n\r\n“‘He’s back there under the big ellum,’ says Denman, ‘sleepin’ sound as\r\na baby.’\r\n\r\n“‘What about the four dollars reward?’ says Bud.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, I guess that’s jest a part of the joke,’ says Ike.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, I don’t see it that away,’ says Bud. ‘The lady has lost her\r\nhusband, and she wants him found and fetched home. Now, I’m goin’ to\r\ntake him home, and if she don’t want him, I can easy fetch him back.’\r\n\r\n“Ike grinned, and looked ‘round at the boys, and they grinned.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t hear no objection,’ says Ike. ‘You’ll find him back there\r\nunder the tree.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ says Bud, ‘I can easy load him into my wagon and haul him home\r\nand unload him in his own yard, but it might be better for you boys that\r\nbeat him up to jest take holt and come along with me; all a-totin’ of\r\nhim home in a friendly way. Then if Tildy wants to know how come his\r\nface all broke up, you can jest show her the knots on your own heads and\r\nit’ll sorter help to explain matters.’\r\n\r\n“Nobody didn’t answer right away, and before anybody could think of any\r\nobjection, Bud added in his insinuatin’ way: ‘It might save trouble to\r\nkeep Tildy pacified, so she’ll explain to Hank that he was to blame for\r\nall that’s been done to him. Now, ever’ body come on and take holt, and\r\nI’ll set ’em up to the crowd soon’s we get back.’\r\n\r\n“Bud always seems to state a proposition so fair an’ reasonable that you\r\njest can’t turn him down, so the boys jest got up without wastin’ any\r\nwords, and followed him around to where Hank was. They gathered him up,\r\none at each corner, and Bud holdin’ up his head. They ketched the step,\r\n‘hayfoot-strawfoot,’ and marched up to Hank’s front gate.\r\n\r\n“Tildy was sweepin’ off the front porch, and when she saw the crowd she\r\ncome out to the gate, lookin’ a little pale, but holdin’ her head up,\r\nand a stiff upper lip.\r\n\r\n“‘What is it?’ says she.\r\n\r\n“‘It’s Hank,’ says Bud.\r\n\r\n“‘Is he hurt?’ says she.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no,’ says Bud. ‘That is to say, they ain’t any bones broke. He’s\r\nbeen a-fightin’ ‘round promiscuous, but he’s got no hurts to call for\r\nanybody to fetch him home. Fact is I saw a advertisement offerin’ a\r\nreward for Hank, and I just discovered him, and rescued him, and fetched\r\nhim home.’\r\n\r\n“‘Didn’t the advertisement say to return him in good order?’ says Tildy.\r\n\r\n“‘I b’leeve it did,’ says Bud, ‘but I couldn’t p’form no miracle for\r\nfour dollars, so I jest fetched him as I found him.’\r\n\r\n“‘And didn’t it say bring him securely tied?’ says Tildy.\r\n\r\n“Bud was set back considerable at that. ‘That’s a fact,’ says he, ‘and I\r\njest plum overlooked it. It didn’t appear to me to be of no consequence,\r\nnohow.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, it’s mighty important to me,’ says Tildy. ‘If he wakes up in a\r\ntantrum, and untied, he might be troublesome.’\r\n\r\n“‘That’s so,’ says Devil Bill, thinking of the lump on his own head.\r\n\r\n“‘So it is,’ says Eli Scoggins, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“‘I believe you,’ says Buck Edwards.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ says Bud Runnels, ‘it ain’t none too late to tie him, but if I\r\nwas you, Mizzes Binford, I b’leeve I’d jest sew him up, good and snug,\r\nin cotton baggin’ or heavy canvas or somethin’ good and stout like that,\r\nand leave nothin’ stickin’ out but jest his head.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘I’ve got the very thing!’ and she went ‘round to the\r\nshed, and come back with the stoutest, heaviest, widest piece of cotton\r\nduckin’ that I ever see.\r\n\r\n“‘I bought it at the auction,’ says she, ‘because it was cheap, and Hank\r\nsaid I never would have no use for it but you see he was mistaken.’\r\n\r\n“Well, we sewed him up good and tight, and put him on the bed in the\r\nspare room and cut a big peachtree limb for Tildy to keep the flies off\r\nof him, and she paid Bud the four dollars.\r\n\r\n“When Hank waked up, Sunday mornin’, he could hear Tildy fryin’ meat in\r\nthe kitchen, and he knowed she was cookin’ breakfast. He didn’t seem to\r\nwant any breakfast, but he thought a cup of strong coffee might be good\r\nfor his head. He tried to git up, but the sheet seemed to be rolled\r\n‘round him so he couldn’t rise. Then he tried to roll over, so he could\r\ngit untangled, but he couldn’t even turn over. Then he got mad, and\r\ntried to bust the sheet, but he strained at it till he was black in the\r\nface, and couldn’t break a stitch. Then he called Tildy. She come in and\r\nwalked ’round in front of him.\r\n\r\n“‘Tildy,’ says he, ‘what’s the matter with this sheet?’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t see nothin’ wrong with it,’ says she.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, then,’ says Hank, ‘what in the nation is the matter with me?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh!’ says Tildy; ‘that’s different. If I undertake to stan’ here and\r\ntell all that’s wrong with you, my breakfast’ll be burnt to a cinder\r\nbefore I’m half through.’ And with that, she turned ‘round and marched\r\naway to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Well, of course Hank was fightin’ mad, but he wasn’t in no shape to do\r\nnothin’ but jest lay still and think, and not in no great shape for\r\nthinkin’, so he jest went to sleep again.\r\n\r\n“Next time he opened his eyes, Tildy was standin’ over him with a dish\r\nof meat and bread, and a cup of hot coffee.\r\n\r\n“‘Good mornin’,’ says she, mighty polite. ‘Would you like to have some\r\nbreakfast?’\r\n\r\n“Hank grinned, kinder sheepish, and she propped up his head, and begun\r\nto feed him with a spoon. When he tried to speak, she would pour a\r\nspoonful of coffee in his mouth, right quick, and he’d have to stop to\r\nswaller, and time he’d git that down, she’d have another one ready for\r\nhim. He was tryin’ to talk all the time, but she didn’t give him a\r\nchance to say a word. Finally, she got so tickled, seein’ him swaller so\r\nfast, that she spilt a lot of hot coffee down his neck.\r\n\r\n“‘Jerusalem!’ he yelled. ‘Woman, do you want to scald me to death?’ And\r\nwith that he begun to cuss, and bluster about what he would do when he\r\ngot loose. Tildy set the dishes on the table without sayin’ a word. Then\r\nshe went to the front door, and called to little Johnnie Martin, in the\r\nnext yard.\r\n\r\n“‘Johnnie,’ she says, ‘is Brother Collins at home?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yessum,’ says Johnnie.\r\n\r\n“‘All right,’ says Tildy, and she went in and put on her bonnet and\r\nstarted out the front door.\r\n\r\n“‘Where you goin’, Tildy?’ Hank asked.\r\n\r\n“‘I’m goin’ after Brother Collins.’\r\n\r\n“‘What for?’\r\n\r\n“‘I want him to talk to you.’\r\n\r\n“‘Me?’ says Hank. ‘I don’t want to talk to no preacher!’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t want you to talk to him,’ says Tildy. ‘I want him to talk to\r\nyou,’ and she walked out the door. When Hank heard her slam the gate\r\nbehind her, he hollered like the house was afire.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Tildy!’ She come back to the door and looked in.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, Tildy,’ says Hank, pitiful as a baby, ‘you don’t aim to make me\r\nthe laughin’-stock of the settlement, do you?’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t see why you need to bother about that,’ says Tildy. ‘If it’s\r\nno disgrace to git drunk, and gamble, and fight, in a corner grocery,\r\nit’s no disgrace to talk to a minister of the gospel.’ She started out\r\nagain, but Hank called her back.\r\n\r\n“‘Hold on, Tildy; I’ll agree to anything you say, if you won’t call in\r\nthe preacher.’\r\n\r\n“‘What you goin’ to do about them circulars I got printed?’ she asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, I’m goin’ down there and maul the life out of old Goatwhiskers\r\nfor printin’ them things,’ says Hank. Tildy started out again, and he\r\nyelled after her to come back. Promised he wouldn’t say a word to him.\r\n\r\n“‘What are you goin’ to say to the boys you had the fight with?’\r\n\r\n“‘Fight!’ says Hank. ‘It wasn’t no fight. The whole crowd lit into me\r\nand mauled me most to death, and I hadn’t said a word.’\r\n\r\n“‘I understand you knocked ’em all down with a cheer, if that’s any\r\nsatisfaction to you,’ says Tildy.\r\n\r\n“‘All right, then,’ says Hank, ‘I’m willin’ to call it square, if they\r\nare.’\r\n\r\n“‘Not goin’ to say a word to nobody about nothin’?’ she asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Not a word,’ says he.\r\n\r\n“‘Not goin’ to drink any more?’\r\n\r\n“‘Not a drop, Tildy. Now, come on and cut this devilish thing off. I\r\nfeel like I’ll die if it stays on me another minute.’ Tildy couldn’t\r\nthink of nothin’ more he could promise, so finally she cut the bastin’\r\nthreads and let him loose. Well, sir, he didn’t say a word out of the\r\nway to them boys that beat ’em up, and he wouldn’t even take a few\r\ndrinks to taper off, and it’s my opinion,” said old Eli, solemnly, “that\r\nhe wouldn’t drink a drop of liquor, right now, if he was bit by a\r\nsnake.”\r\n\r\nThey were driving into Jonesboro when the old man finished his story,\r\nand the big town clock struck four.\r\n\r\n“Great guns!” cried Hodges in amazement, “it’s four o’clock!”\r\n\r\n“Egzackly,” said Eli, with an air of innocent triumph. “I’ve drove over\r\nthis road so often, I can time the trip to a minute. You said you wanted\r\nto be here egzackly at four o’clock—”\r\n\r\n“Four devils!” Hodges yelled. “I said four hours! I’m two hours late.\r\nI’ll have to stay in this jay town a whole day!”\r\n\r\n“My, my!” exclaimed old Eli. “Somebody’s made a terrible mistake. I do\r\nhope I wasn’t in no way to blame for it. Now, if you’d just mentioned\r\nthat you was behind time, I could easy have put them grays through two\r\nhours earlier.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s my fault, I guess,” said Hodges, when his wrath had subsided.\r\n“I told old Elrod, but I ought to have told you, too. Then I rode along\r\nfor four mortal hours sucking that bottle of foolkiller, and didn’t have\r\nsense enough to look at my watch once. Well, well! I’ll just charge it\r\nup to Hodges, and see it don’t happen again.”\r\n\r\nThough Eli was not to blame, he was inconsolable, till Hodges gave him a\r\ndollar at parting. Tears of gratitude stood in the old man’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Stranger,” he said. “I do hope old man Elrod won’t find out\r\nabout you bein’ late. He’d be powerful pestered to know you’d been\r\ndisappointed. Good-bye.” And as he drove away, he muttered to himself:\r\n“Darn the feller! I think he might have offered to fill my bottle.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern lecturer is the alarm clock of civilization wound up to go\r\noff with a whiz and a bang at any hour in the evening, according to the\r\nwhims of his audience.

You are as good as a breath of the blessed\r\nout-doors.” And she kissed the newcomer’s glowing cheeks.\r\n\r\nThere was a general breeziness about Cora that justified Mabel’s words.\r\nShe sailed into the room, veils fluttering and skirts rustling, kissed\r\nher friend swiftly and settled upon the arm of her chair like a bird on\r\na bough.\r\n\r\n“But, Angel of Peace, there’s nothing blessed about me. I’m in another\r\nscrape.” She opened her big eyes impressively upon her audience. The\r\naudience sat up in her chair and asked with interest, “What disagreeable\r\nthing has happened now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I didn’t say it was disagreeable, did I? It wasn’t at all; at least\r\nit _is_ not. Quite otherwise, really.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Cora, you are the only person I know who can get into a dreadful\r\nscrape and have a lovely time there.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because I feel so much at home. And then, some way, even if the\r\nscrape is personally painful I can enjoy its picturesqueness\r\nobjectively, you know. That’s the way with this one. Personally it was\r\nvery painful to be placed in such a position, especially with such\r\npeople, you know.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t know, but I’m dying to. I only live to hear your\r\nadventures. I never could have stood this sprained ankle if you had not\r\ncome in to refresh me with your hairbreadth escapes. You are a perfect\r\nSinbad.”\r\n\r\n“Now you need not poke fun at me. Queer things do happen to me and I\r\nthought you liked to hear about them.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I do, I do. I was just telling you how I liked it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you may thank your poor little ankle for preventing you from\r\nsharing this adventure, because if you had been able to walk I should\r\nhave invited you to go to the Valley of Diamonds with me, and then I\r\nwonder what you would have done with that conscience of yours?”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about? I suppose you have been entering Tiffany’s\r\nvaults?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly—and it wasn’t a Valley of Diamonds, but a Valley of Matinee\r\nTickets, which is quite as remarkable as anything Sinbad saw.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t prelude so much. I am harrowed to the last degree.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you the whole story.” Cora shook her broad hat back over her\r\ntawny hair, dropped down upon a stool and clasped her hands about her\r\nknees. Mabel settled herself in the Morris chair with a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction and anticipation.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know this is the 28th of the month. That means I’ve been\r\nabsolutely broke for a week.”\r\n\r\nMabel accepted this axiom and told her to go on and not be slangy.\r\n\r\n“And doubtless you know too that ‘The Golden Quest’ has been running all\r\nweek at Howards?\r\n\r\n“I should think I did know it. I’ve been reading the papers every\r\nmorning and eating my heart out in bitterness and tears. I’d give my\r\neyes to see that third act. They do say she has the most gorgeous\r\ncostumes in America, and her voice—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, her voice, but lots of people have voices. Not many of us have\r\nquarts of diamonds, and I was wild to see those, and I hadn’t a cent\r\nexcept the quarter Uncle Joe gave me when I had my first tooth pulled.\r\nThat always stands between me and starvation and I like to keep it\r\nthere; besides, the tickets were two dollars. I could not go to Daddy\r\nafter the affair of The Gold Buckles, and I felt a certain delicacy in\r\napproaching the cook on the subject. I was thinking of selling my new\r\nshoes when Laura’s note came saying six of us were to lunch with her\r\nSaturday. I thought that would make me forget myself during the worst\r\ntime and keep me from pawning my gold handled umbrella.\r\n\r\n“Saturday came and I rode down to Laura’s, trying to avoid the posters.\r\nIt was an awfully nice luncheon and Geraldine wore her new green.\r\nBeautiful dress but it makes her look bunchy. Well, any way we had just\r\ngotten to mushroom timbales—don’t you love timbales? I wonder how they\r\nmake them—. Well, we were at timbales when the ’phone rang and the maid\r\nsaid someone wanted me. It was Mary, our cook, and she said a messenger\r\nboy had just brought some theater tickets and should she send them to me\r\nor was I coming back before the matinee. My heart leaped within me, but\r\nI calmed myself by considering that they were probably tickets for\r\nStereopticon Views of Palestine, for Aunt Myra is always sending me that\r\nkind of thing. So I managed to contain myself sufficiently to ask\r\ndetails. My dear, can you imagine the tumult and wild joy raised in my\r\nbosom when Mary read over the tickets and found they were for ‘The\r\nGolden Quest’ and there were six of them? I told her to send them to\r\nLaura’s and then I tore back to the dining room. You should have heard\r\nthe shrieks of jubilation. We beat the table with our forks and sang the\r\nopening chorus. Six tickets and six girls and all in our happy clothes,\r\nthe matinee only an hour off and they had all wanted to see it as much\r\nas I. When the first wild burst was over, it occurred to me to wonder\r\nwhere the tickets came from. At first they seemed a direct answer to\r\nprayer, but I began to think there must be a more palpable source. It\r\nwasn’t Daddy. He had not forgiven me enough yet to be so horribly\r\ngenerous. And the only other person was Aunt Myra and she is old\r\nfashioned and Presbyterian.”\r\n\r\n“What has that to do with it, Cora?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it means she regards me as a raging heathen and never shows me any\r\nconsideration as her niece, but a great deal of attention as a soul to\r\nbe saved. She sends me little books and a weekly paper, and when a\r\nmissionary visits her house she invites me over. She hopes to show me\r\nthe beauties of a Higher Life, but it only sets me against\r\nPresbyterianism, because all the missionaries make noises with their\r\nsoup and it must be awful to belong to a church like that.”\r\n\r\n“Cora, you are a disgrace to a civilized family. And besides, it may\r\nafter all have been your aunt that sent the tickets, hoping to win you\r\nthrough kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Mabel, you rave! Aunt Myra regards the theater as the clearest\r\nmanifestation of the Evil One on earth, and her saintly little Caddie is\r\nnot allowed to look at a poster. A nephew is visiting them now, and I\r\ndare say they are taking him to the midweek lectures on Genesis in the\r\nLight of Arabian Topography. I know Aunt hopes to win him to her church,\r\nas he has heaps of money and they need a new chapel. As he belongs to\r\nher side of the family I suppose he trots along, and perhaps leads the\r\nexperience meeting. I should not wonder if he wears a lawn tie in the\r\nmorning,—that is a special mark of sanctity, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Cora, I refuse to listen to you. You don’t know a thing about real\r\nchurch life, so leave it alone and go back to your matinee.”\r\n\r\n“With gleesome heart, my dear. After I had cut Aunt Myra off my list of\r\npossible donors I was absolutely at a loss, and we girls just decided to\r\nbelieve in fairy godmothers, when the boy came with the tickets. How we\r\ngloated over that little envelope. I pulled them out, and Mabel—they\r\nwere box-seats—six seats, box-seats to “The Golden Quest.” Talk about\r\nyour Valley of Diamonds! We were all dazed and felt as if we were\r\nenchanted. It is such a beautiful thing to have your dreams come true in\r\nthat miraculous way, though to be sure I had no more dreamed of\r\nbox-seats than I had dreamed of the Koh-i-nor in my new hat. We wondered\r\nmore than ever, and took turns looking at the tickets for some revealing\r\nclue. They were good bona-fide tickets, but that was all. There was no\r\ncard, no name, no hint; even the envelope was the theater one with just\r\nthe address scribbled over the ads. on the outside.\r\n\r\n“Well, we didn’t care and scrambled into our things and hied us to the\r\ntheater, while the girls chanted my praises and sang pæans of rejoicing\r\nand gratitude. The theater was full when we arrived and everybody was in\r\nher most gorgeous things, and we were the haughtiest ever when the usher\r\nshowed us to our box. Our box! Why, we acted as if we’d always had it\r\nfor the season. There was a little delay, for some reason, that gave me\r\ntime to think. The mystery of the tickets puzzled me and was beginning\r\nto worry me a little, too. What if there was some mistake and I had\r\nrushed into all this with my usual mistaken velocity! The responsibility\r\nmade me feel a little queer, Mabel, honestly. If it had not been such a\r\nfrightfully extravagant thing I wouldn’t have thought so much of it. But\r\nnot many people send thirty dollar tickets around promiscuously among\r\nthe deserving poor. The girls were as gay as larks, but I couldn’t let\r\nmyself go some way. They could afford to be gay. They were simply\r\nguests, but I,—whose guest was I? It was sort of getting on my nerves\r\nwhen a little diversion came. Six dashing young men came into the\r\ntheater and stood talking to the usher. They were quite different from\r\nthe men about here and created a sensation. Any one could see they were\r\nstrangers and we all wondered where they got their beautiful clothes.\r\nOne seemed to be the head of the party and he was having quite a lengthy\r\nconsultation with the usher, so we had a good look at them. We were\r\nstaring with all our eyes, I dare say, when suddenly that first young\r\nman lifted his head from talking to the usher and looked straight into\r\nour box—looked not casually and accidentally but deliberately and\r\nprolongedly, Mabel, and I began to feel my hat was wrong when he turned\r\nback to the usher and shook his head decidedly. Then the usher looked at\r\nus and my heart jumped right up into my new stock. It was something\r\nabout those awful tickets and perhaps there was something the matter and\r\nthey would come and turn us out of the box. What would the girls do to\r\nme and what would the people think and who was that man and who was\r\nresponsible for the tickets? I was beginning to wish I had never heard\r\nof “The Golden Quest” and was sure I couldn’t stand it till the third\r\nact, when the usher and the man turned around and went out to the box\r\noffice. Something was going to happen. What could I do? Here were the\r\nfive girls at the heights of bliss and anticipation, and here was I in\r\nthe depths of anxious misery, and there were the five young men staring\r\ncoolly around, waiting for their friend, and there was the man out at\r\nthe box office probably demanding that I be seized and turned with my\r\nfriends into the streets. But what could I do? It wasn’t my fault, for\r\nthe tickets had been sent to me, surely. Perhaps they had been stolen\r\nand sent to me as a revenge from some inhuman enemy. I thought of\r\neverything, Mabel, and then the man came back, collected his friends and\r\nthe whole party with their usher at their head, came down the side aisle\r\ntoward our box. I had just time to arrange my sad story and be thankful\r\nI had on my best hat when they reached the curtains of our box. I\r\nstarted up, but, Mabel, they went right on to the next box and sat down.\r\nI breathed again, but not very freely, for surely that man knew\r\nsomething about our box, or was my guilty conscience causing me\r\nhallucinations? Yet why guilty? What had I done? Apparently the worst\r\nwas over now, but I was not at ease and thought the incident might at\r\nany moment repeat itself with different results. There was a blare of\r\norchestra and the curtain went up; after one hurried glance at the stage\r\nI glued my eye to the door again. Fifteen minutes passed and nothing\r\nhappened and so I turned around—turned to look into the interested eyes\r\nof the man in the other box. Perhaps he was a detective and watching me,\r\nbut he didn’t look a bit like that, though he had quite a different look\r\nfrom the one a man ordinarily gives a girl in a pretty hat. My hat was\r\nvery pretty—you remember the big black one—but it didn’t justify, the\r\ninquiring interest with which he regarded me. Yet he did not stare.\r\nReally he did not, Mabel, but was very decent. I looked at the stage now\r\nbut sort of felt him there some way, and had a little feeling about the\r\ndoor, too, so I wasn’t very comfortable. When the curtain went down on\r\nthe first act I expected to have a swarm of irate claimants for the box\r\nswoop down upon me, but not a soul appeared, and surely no one would\r\ncome after that. I took the little envelope out of my bag and looked at\r\nit again. Nothing but 1229 Second on it—in pencil—. That was our number\r\nall right. Then something struck me. It was just 1229 Second, and ours\r\nis 1229 West Second. But after all that could make little difference, as\r\nheaps of our things come out marked that way and there is rarely a\r\nmistake, as Aunt Myra’s, by some freak of fate, is 1229 East Second, and\r\neverybody knows us both and knows which is which. The only accident that\r\never happened was that awful thing about Mme. Durant and the\r\nbridesmaid’s hat—you remember that? That incident made me notice the\r\naddress, but I could not explain the mystery that way, for no theater\r\ntickets like these could ever have been sent to Aunt Myra’s respectable\r\ndoor. These were the things I pondered and puzzled while the play went\r\nmerrily on. I didn’t see or hear much of it and I don’t believe that man\r\nin the box saw much more. He seemed to be pondering something, too.\r\n\r\n“At last the thing was over and the crowd trooped out—among them the\r\nfive young men and _the_ man. You would have called him _the_ man, too,\r\nMabel, for he was quite different from the rest. Such shoulders and such\r\na carriage! He held his head as if he were commanding an army or a\r\nyacht. Yet when we passed them in the corridor outside the box he bowed\r\nwith such respectful humility. He was awfully impressive, but I was too\r\nmuch troubled to consider him long.\r\n\r\n“The girls were wild with enthusiasm, so I suppose the play was really\r\ngood. Anyway the girls were so full of admiration and adjectives that it\r\nwas very easy to slip away from them a minute. I stepped to the box\r\noffice and inquired about those tickets. The man was very polite, but\r\ndidn’t know anything except that they had been ordered by ’phone to be\r\nsent to that address. They had been sent, but the man who said he had\r\nordered them arrived shortly before the matinee and said they had not\r\ncome. The usher assured him they must have been delivered for they had\r\nbeen presented just a few minutes before, and he showed the man the box.\r\nWhereupon the man paid for the tickets and procured another box. The man\r\nin the box office was very calm about it as he had his money, but I\r\nwasn’t. I told him I had gotten the tickets by mistake and must pay for\r\nthem. He said he had been paid. I tried to show him I must pay, but he\r\nseemed to think me very foolish and said if I paid anyone I must pay the\r\nman who bought the tickets. I said that was what I wanted to do, but\r\ncouldn’t he do it for me. He said he couldn’t as he had no idea who the\r\nman was or where he could be found. But if I could get the address he\r\nwould gladly forward the money through the theater. He had begun to look\r\nas if he thought it a joke, so I had to be satisfied with that and went\r\nback to the girls.”\r\n\r\n“But, Cora, what would you have done if he had said, ‘Oh, yes; Mr. Z. is\r\none of our regular patrons. If you will give me the money I’ll give you\r\na receipt and reimburse him.’ You didn’t have your chatelaine full of\r\nbills, did you? I suppose you would have passed your gold handled\r\numbrella through the window and given that to the man as a token of your\r\ngrateful esteem.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the remotest idea what I would have done if he had asked for\r\nthe money. As it was, I became from that hour a man-hunter. It has its\r\nfascinations as a pastime but is discouraging in its results. My method\r\nhas its limitations. My only hope is that he can’t escape the girls long\r\nand I’ll soon hear of him again. I’m praying I may hear of him before I\r\nmeet him face to face. Wouldn’t it be ghastly, Mabel, if at a crush some\r\ntime my hostess should suddenly confront me with this man—and he would\r\ncry, ‘This is the young person who defrauded me of thirty dollars worth\r\nof matinee tickets?’ Only I know he would never denounce me openly. He\r\nwould just wither me with silent scorn. Yet he didn’t look withering\r\nSaturday. Why on earth didn’t he give me a chance to straighten things\r\nout then and there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it would have been so much more comfortable if he had demanded an\r\nexplanation as the curtain went down and your guests turned to thank\r\nyou. No, Cora, I think he did the only thing to do and did it\r\nbeautifully. His effacement of himself shows he has a heart of gold.\r\nMost men would have left some chance to be thanked, any way. Still, it\r\nis embarrassing for you. However, I would not look too hard for him till\r\nmy next allowance came. Your father would never understand this delicate\r\nsituation.”\r\n\r\n“Father! Heavens, no! Not a soul knows but you and the box office man,\r\nand I know you understand, don’t you, dear? Isn’t it awful—but isn’t it\r\ninteresting? I wish you could have seen the man. And I do wish your\r\nankle was well enough to permit of your going about with me, for I know\r\nI shall faint when I see him again.”\r\n\r\nCora glanced at her absurd little watch, and jumped to her feet.\r\n“Goodness, nearly five, and I’m due at Aunt Myra’s for dinner at seven.\r\nIt is to meet that nephew of hers and a missionary or two, probably. I\r\nhate to waste the time, because if I were somewhere else I might get a\r\nclue to my man.”\r\n\r\n“So you haven’t met the nephew yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; Aunt wanted to give Caddie a good chance at him first,\r\nbecause she wants Caddie to have what is left after he builds the\r\nchapel. As if I would look at the solemn prig.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know he is a prig?”\r\n\r\n“Because Aunt Myra likes him. Caddie won’t look at him, either, though,\r\nbecause her eyes are full of that downy little theologue, and all Aunt\r\nMyra’s talk against worldliness is going to rebound upon her own head.\r\nIs that a mixed metaphor? Anyway, Caddie has set her affections on\r\nthings above and wouldn’t look twice at a million. Good-bye, dear. This\r\nburst of confidence has eased my nerves wonderfully, and I’ll come again\r\nthe instant I find a clue and tell you all about it. You are the only\r\nrelative I have that does not think me shocking, and I love\r\nyou—good-bye.” An airy kiss and she was gone, leaving a faint suggestion\r\nof violets behind her fluttering veils.\r\n\r\nIt was half past nine the next morning and Mabel was having coffee and\r\nrolls in bed when in rushed Cora, radiant, glowing, and evidently\r\nbursting with news.\r\n\r\nMabel rose on her elbow.\r\n\r\n“Cora, you have found him!”\r\n\r\nCora settled herself in a fluffy pink heap on the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n“Now, it’s not fair unless you let me tell you the whole affair just as\r\nit happened.”\r\n\r\n“All right, but do hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” began Cora, then paused long enough to remove her hat carefully,\r\ntoss it beside her on the bed, and pat her little fingers over the most\r\nobstreperously crinkly waves around her face. “Well,” she said, “when I\r\ngot home last night I began right away to dress for Aunt Myra’s. Daddy\r\nsent word to tell her he couldn’t come because a business friend had\r\njust arrived. Daddy’s friends always arrive just about an hour before\r\nAunt Myra’s dinners. I think he keeps a corps of them just for such\r\nemergencies. Then I was nearly late trying to decide whether I’d wear\r\nthat black chiffon that I can’t afford to throw away just yet, or my\r\nsweet new pale green and make the missionaries dream of other worlds\r\nthan theirs. I finally decided on the green because the other fastens in\r\nthe back and Jane had a terrible toothache. So I wore the green, and of\r\ncourse that horrid little opal pin Aunt Myra gave me, but it didn’t show\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n“Aunt received me with her usual sanctimonious frigidity and inquired\r\nafter my health. We sat in stony silence for a few minutes. Caddie was\r\nsitting by the window but there were no missionaries about. Finally the\r\nclock struck seven. We had waited only three minutes but I was already\r\nfrozen to my chair. When the clock struck Aunt Myra turned to Caddie and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“‘Where is your cousin Robert?’\r\n\r\n_I_ should have asked if I were my cousin’s keeper, but Caddie is meek\r\nand said he had been detained down town and was dressing, she thought.\r\n\r\n“‘Your cousin seems to have no regard for a regular family life,’ said\r\nAunt accusingly, and stalked out, evidently to drag the culprit to his\r\ndinner. I knew by the way she shoved the relationship off on Caddie that\r\nshe didn’t approve of her nephew, and so I thought he might prove a\r\npossible person, after all.\r\n\r\n“The minute Aunt had closed the door after her Caddie rushed over to me\r\nand began to whisper. She is a sweet little thing, but suppressed beyond\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Cousin Cora,’ she said, ‘I have been dying to tell some one and\r\nyou will be just the one to understand. It is the most exciting thing!\r\nPoor Cousin Robert isn’t a bit like us and he has a dreadful time with\r\nMamma. He hasn’t been brought up in our way, but lives in New York in\r\nsuch a worldly family, and he doesn’t think anything of dancing and the\r\ntheater, and he even plays cards. He seems very nice, though, and as\r\nlong as that is the way he was taught I don’t know that he is to blame.\r\nBut Mamma preaches at him all the time and he escapes whenever he can\r\npolitely, because he is always considerate, even when Mamma is the\r\nworst. He has been lovely to me and I told him all about Clifford and he\r\nis going to help us. Well, he told me his troubles, too. A lot of his\r\ncollege friends came through here the other day and he couldn’t invite\r\nthem to the house, because he knew Mamma wouldn’t approve of them, so he\r\ngave a little lunch down town somewhere and invited them to go to some\r\nplay. He ’phoned for the tickets early in the morning and they were to\r\ncome here, but they didn’t come, so he said he would get them at the\r\ntheater. Well, Cora, he got home just in time for dinner and was so\r\nexcited, and afterwards he took me into the library and told me all\r\nabout it. There was some mistake about the tickets for they had been\r\nused already and the people were in the box—,’ Mabel, it would sound\r\nawfully silly for me to tell you all she said he said.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Mabel, sternly; “I must hear all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Caddie said he said it was the mistake of his life for it showed\r\nhim the sweetest girl in the world. And then she told me a lot of stuff\r\nlike that and wound up by asking me if I’d help her find the girl for\r\nhim, because he had vowed he would spend the rest of his life looking,\r\nif necessary, and if she helped him he would see that Clifford had the\r\nnew chapel. She was explaining it all to me when in came her Cousin\r\nRobert. He stopped short, and I was the color of that cushion. Caddie\r\ndidn’t notice, but introduced us and told Mr. Page that she was sure I\r\ncould help him in his search, as the girl was probably in my set. He\r\nlooked hard at me and said he thought I might be able to help him—and,\r\nMabel, I was awfully glad I had on that green. And Caddie said, ‘Tell\r\nCousin Cora what the girl was like, Robert,’—and Mabel, that man had the\r\nbrazen effrontery to do it. He looked me straight in the eye and told me\r\nwhat he thought of my hair and eyes and nose and even my clothes. And\r\nAunt Myra came in and was displeased. Caddie had told her something of\r\nthe matinee experience, and Aunt said severely, ‘Are you still\r\ndiscussing that impudent creature at the theater? I should think it\r\nwould have been enough to have seen her at such a place without her\r\nbeing there on stolen tickets!’ So we dropped the matinee girl, to my\r\ninfinite relief. When I rose to go home Mr. Page insisted upon\r\naccompanying me and told Aunt Myra he hoped to interest me in the plans\r\nfor the chapel. And on the way home, Mabel, he didn’t allude to the\r\nmatinee and I hated to drag it in. He kept talking about that chapel and\r\nsaid he wanted me to help him with the architect’s plans, as he wished\r\nmy opinion on it because I might have to go there some time. He expected\r\nto. I suppose he was just talking to kill time. He said he was nearly\r\ndead from an excess of virtue that came from staying with Aunt Myra a\r\nweek, and wouldn’t I please, as one heathen to another, ask him to tea?\r\nSo he is coming this afternoon, Mabel.

Foster.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the undeveloped resources of the South lie dormant the possibilities\r\nof fortune that “far surpass the wealth of Ormus or of Ind.” For more\r\nthan two centuries the incomparable climate and soil of this section\r\nhave commanded the admiration of the world; and during this period\r\nfortunes were amassed purely by agriculture, mainly in the last century\r\nby cotton, and were handed down from father to son, until the corner\r\nstone of the industrial system was wrenched loose by a fratricidal war,\r\nand anarchy for a time supervened. As Henry Watterson pithily puts it:\r\n“The whole story of the South may be summed up in a sentence: She was\r\nrich, and she lost her riches; she was poor and in bondage; she was set\r\nfree, and she had to go to work; she went to work, and she is richer\r\nthan ever before.”\r\n\r\nYet what a change from the happy years of ante-bellum prosperity, when\r\nthe South was by far the wealthiest section of the country, to the\r\ndesolation, the poverty and the criminal oppression of reconstruction\r\ntimes! After four years of the most sanguinary strife in the history of\r\nthe world the Southern soldier took up the battle of existence and of\r\nmaintenance and of rehabilitation. Let Henry W. Grady tell the\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n“What does he find when, having followed the battle-stained cross\r\nagainst overwhelming odds, dreading death not half so much as surrender,\r\nhe reaches the home he left prosperous and beautiful? He finds his house\r\nin ruins, his farm devastated, his slaves free, his stock killed, his\r\nbarn empty, his trade destroyed, his money worthless; his social system,\r\nfeudal in its magnificence, swept away; his people without law or legal\r\nstatus; his comrades slain, and the burdens of others heavy on his\r\nshoulders. Crushed by defeat, his very traditions gone; without money,\r\ncredit, employment, material training; and besides all this, confronted\r\nwith the gravest problem that ever met human intelligence—the\r\nestablishing of a status for the vast body of his liberated slaves.\r\n\r\n“What does he do—this hero in gray with a heart of gold? Does he sit\r\ndown in sullenness and despair? Not for a day. Surely God, who had\r\nstripped him of his prosperity, inspired him in his adversity. As ruin\r\nwas never before so overwhelming, never was restoration swifter. The\r\nsoldier stepped from the trenches into the furrow; horses that had\r\ncharged Federal guns marched before the plow, and fields that ran red\r\nwith human blood in April were green with the harvest in June; women\r\nreared in luxury cut up their dresses and made breeches for their\r\nhusbands, and, with a patience and heroism that fit women always as a\r\ngarment, gave their hands to work.”\r\n\r\nNone but people whose civilization has never had its equal in chivalric\r\npower and grace, whose ability of mind and strength of heart were\r\nderived from the purest Anglo-Saxon blood, could have restored their\r\nfortune and excelled the material welfare of its past as have the people\r\nof the South within the short expanse of forty years.\r\n\r\nIn its struggles for advancement the South has known, and still knows,\r\ntwo problems:\r\n\r\nFirst, its duty to an inferior, dependent race; and second, its duty to\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\nIn its conscious and its unconscious evolution and in its conscious and\r\nits unconscious solutions of these problems the South has been favored\r\nby certain material and climatic advantages:\r\n\r\nIt possesses by nature the fairest and richest domain on the face of the\r\nearth. Here we find a vast stock of the materials proper for the art and\r\ningenuity of man to work upon; treasures of immense worth, concealed\r\nfrom the ignorant aboriginal red man, unknown or neglected by the\r\nplanter, and utilized only within the last thirty years. Now the rocks\r\nare disclosing their hidden gems; huge mountains of iron and coal and\r\nlimestone, of lead and zinc and marble and phosphate, are pouring forth\r\nvast stores; and more than one-half the timber wealth of the entire\r\ncountry is found within the Southern states conserved in virgin forests\r\nand reserved for the present and for the coming generations. The South\r\nproduces two-thirds of the cotton of the world. The water power is\r\nenormous and perennial, and the commercial situation relative to the\r\nworld is unequalled. Of the four essentials to all industries,\r\ntherefore, iron, wood, cotton and motive power, the South is abundantly\r\nblessed. Add to these a perfect climate and a fertile soil which yields\r\nevery product of the temperate zone, and who shall deny to the South the\r\nprimacy in the years to come?\r\n\r\nThe remarkable results effected in the South since the war between the\r\nStates have been attained principally in the last twenty-five years.\r\nStatistics, which are often dry and uninteresting, in this case prove\r\nthe argument most conclusively.\r\n\r\nThe wages paid to factory hands in the South, which in 1880 were\r\n$75,900,000, had risen to $249,413,150 in 1900, and are now $350,000,000\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested in manufacturing in the South in 1880 was\r\n$257,000,000; in 1900, $1,153,002,368, and now $1,500,000,000, annually,\r\nand rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nThe value of its manufactured products in 1880 was $457,400,000; in\r\n1900, $1,463,643,177, and now $2,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the last twenty-five years the increases of other important products\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nPig iron from 397,000 tons to 3,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nCoal from 6,000,000 tons to 45,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nPhosphate (since 1890), from 750,000 tons to 3,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nRailroad mileage, from 20,600 miles to 55,000 miles.\r\n\r\nCotton, from 5,757,397 bales to 12,162,000 bales.\r\n\r\nThe grain crop (corn, wheat, oats and rye), from 431,000,000 bushels to\r\n791,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThese facts are impressive, convincing and full of hope for the future.\r\n\r\nThe value of the staple crops—corn, wheat, oats, Irish potatoes, rye and\r\nhay—in 1904 was $542,121,000; the value of the other farm crops was\r\n$550,000,000; and the value of the cotton not less than $515,000,000,\r\nbesides the cotton seed, amounting to $50,000,000 more. All this amounts\r\nto an aggregate sum of $3,657,121,000, earned annually by the South from\r\nthe sources indicated, not including the lumber and other raw material,\r\nwhich, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, leave the South\r\nannually for all the parts of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the South is prosperous! And an indubitable proof of its\r\nprosperity lies in its increase in the assessed valuation of its\r\nproperty. This increase since 1900 amounts to $1,000,000,000 for the\r\nfourteen states of the South. This is partly due to raised assessments,\r\npartly to increased prices for its products, but mainly to an increase\r\nof customary products and to new products. The increase in the wealth of\r\nthe South, however, has been steady for the last twenty years, and in\r\nthat time has aggregated more than $2,300,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhat now is the magic spell which has wrought this abundant prosperity,\r\nthe sesame by the pronouncing of which is opened the secret hiding place\r\nof Southern wealth? _Diversification_ is the word—diversification of\r\ncrops and diversification of manufacturing and diversification of all\r\nindustries. Cotton, though a puissant monarch, seated upon a throne,\r\nfrom which for reasons of perfect adaptability of soil and climate he\r\ncan never be deposed, is not the only king who conducts a beneficent\r\nsway for the complex needs of an enterprising people.\r\n\r\nThe forest king rears his august head and stretches out his hands\r\ncornucopia-like from the Potomac to the Rio Grande and from the Gulf to\r\nthe Ohio, inviting capital and effort to his virgin domains, which, if\r\nproperly protected, will in the future be a source of perpetual and\r\ninestimable wealth; and which even now furnish to the South\r\napproximately $400,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nPhosphate is another king whose sway within his narrow domain is as\r\nabsolute as is that of cotton. The United States furnishes more than\r\nhalf the phosphate rock of the world, and of this the South supplies all\r\nbut an inconsiderable quantity. This product, of vast consequences to\r\nthe agriculture of this section, is a comparatively recent discovery.\r\nThe active development of phosphate mining commenced in South Carolina\r\nin 1868; it was greatly stimulated by the discovery of large deposits in\r\nFlorida in 1888, and has been attaining greater and ever greater\r\nproportions since the exploitation of the immense bodies of rich rock in\r\nMiddle Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAnd of like importance to cotton and phosphate is that modern industrial\r\ntriumvirate, coal, iron ore and limestone. These essential elements in\r\nthe production of pig iron are found in close juxtaposition in thousands\r\nof localities from Birmingham, Ala., to West Virginia. In the latter\r\nnamed state are twenty thousand square miles of coal; in Tennessee five\r\nthousand; in Alabama still more, besides the smaller fields of Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia and Texas.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Henry Watterson was criticised as visionary for his\r\nassertion that pig iron, which was then selling at Pittsburg at $20 to\r\n$25 per ton, could be profitably produced in the South at $10 per ton.\r\nYet it has been sold on the market at Birmingham and other points at $7\r\nper ton. This is rendered possible by the fact that two tons of iron\r\nore, two tons of coal and one ton of limestone can be bought in the\r\nground for an average of twenty cents a ton, or $1.00 for the whole. And\r\nthe consequence is that Southern iron is offered in the English markets\r\nand on the Continent of Europe in competition with the whole world.\r\n\r\nBesides the elements of wealth of prime importance, which have\r\nheretofore been mentioned, there are many others, the aggregate of which\r\ncontributes materially to the riches of the South, such as cotton-seed,\r\ntobacco, rice, leather, fruits, vegetables, cattle, wool, fine horses\r\nand other live stock. But when all is said it is manufacturing which\r\nproduces most wealth; it is manufacturing which the South most needs,\r\nand it is manufacturing which offers in the South a most attractive\r\navenue for investment. Textiles should accompany and follow the\r\nproduction of cotton and wool. Steel should be made from pig iron and\r\nmachinery from both. Fertilizers should be manufactured in close\r\nproximity to the phosphate rock; and furniture and fine finishing in\r\ncontiguity to the forests.\r\n\r\nIn all these directions the South has done and is doing much.\r\nTwenty-five years ago Judge Kelley of Pennsylvania, “Pig Iron” Kelley,\r\npredicted the coming power of the South in industrial pursuits, and\r\nsaid, “The development of the South means the enrichment of the nation.”\r\nWhat though a cotton mill remove from New England to that region of the\r\nSouth which produces the staple; what though a furniture factory from\r\nMichigan seek the incomparable forests of the South, or a boot and shoe\r\nfactory from any other section depart to the localities abounding in\r\nhides and tanning bark; their places will be taken by other industries,\r\nconducted by other men with new capital.\r\n\r\nAnd the South has another source of wealth which has hitherto been\r\nunsuspected, one which means additional annual income by the hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars; one which represents a new industry in the economy\r\nof the world, and a new source of supply for an ever-increasing demand.\r\nIt is the _production of sugar from the stalk of the common maize or\r\nIndian corn_. The inherent interest in such a surprising announcement\r\nand the far-reaching effects of the industry primarily upon the fortunes\r\nand the commerce of the South and secondarily upon those of the world,\r\nwarrant, if they do not demand, a brief account of a discovery which\r\nmeans a new departure in several different directions:\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Prof. F. L. Stewart, the eminent scientist of\r\nMurrysville, Pa., discovered that, if the immature ears of corn be\r\nremoved at nearly the roasting ear period, a physiological change then\r\ntakes place in the plant. Its life is greatly prolonged and the vigor\r\nwhich was previously expended toward the maturing of the grain is\r\nthereafter directed toward the production of sugar, as certainly, as\r\nuniformly, and to as great an extent as is the case of the ripening\r\nsugar cane. As a consequence from twelve to fifteen per cent of sugar is\r\nthen contained in the stalk, instead of the five or six per cent which\r\nit ordinarily possesses; and the yield is from 140 to 200 pounds of\r\nsugar to the ton, while each acre will produce from twelve to seventeen\r\ntons of trimmed stalks. And the cost of the production of sugar by the\r\nStewart processes is only one and a half cents per pound, as against two\r\nand one-fourth cents from sugar cane and three cents from sugar beets.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not all; the by-products are as valuable as the sugar. These\r\nare paper pulp, cellulose, fine charcoal, stock feed and preparations of\r\nvalue in the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nHere is food for thought indeed! How its application to the South\r\nenlarges, for it is the South which is destined to be the main\r\nbeneficiary of this astounding discovery. Sugar cane cannot be grown\r\nsuccessfully farther north than thirty degrees of latitude; the sugar\r\nbeet cannot be grown successfully farther south than forty degrees of\r\nlatitude. This leaves a broad strip of ten degrees of latitude, mainly\r\nin the South, in which sugar from cornstalks can be and will be produced\r\nin enormous quantities. The North cannot share in the profits of this\r\nindustry, because its season is too short for the maturing of the sugar\r\nin the juice.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this industry will be a revolution in the raising of corn\r\nin the Southern states.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the future of the South in its dealings with the countries\r\nof Central America and of South America? But a few miles of railroad are\r\nnow needed to unite the two American continents, and but a few miles of\r\ncanal will cleave them in twain—union and disunion in commercial\r\nharmony. Then will the South come into its own in the advantages of\r\nforeign commerce which will not be restricted to its trade with the\r\nwestern hemisphere. The Eastern and the Southern nations need everything\r\nthat we produce. We need nearly everything that they produce, and in the\r\nensuing reciprocity of the new order of things many indirections of the\r\npresent laws of commerce shall be straightened.\r\n\r\nAnd yet—shall it be said?—there are those who fear that, in the hurrying\r\nstrife for wealth, the sterling qualities which characterized the old\r\nregime may become atrophied, if not entirely lost. Such fears are futile\r\nand unfounded. The present generation is not so immersed in its progress\r\nthat it is unmindful of the patriotism and example of its forbears; it\r\nknows that the hope of the nation in former times rested in the South;\r\nthat its leaders were the bearers of the ark of the covenant and the\r\npuissant directors of the policies of an entire country; to them and to\r\ntheir history, biography and traditions do the present leaders turn for\r\ninspiration toward the best achievement. And while industrial conditions\r\nhave changed, the South needs her sons to-day as much as when she\r\nsummoned them to the forum to maintain her political supremacy and when\r\nshe called them to the field to maintain her honor. And they will never\r\nfail her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SOCIETY OF THE FOREST.\r\n                        (A STORY FOR CHILDREN.)\r\n\r\n                           By M. W. Connolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AT MRS. FROG’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of a clear lake that lay near the edge of a great forest\r\nlived a family in a house all its own. This family consisted of Mr. Frog\r\nand Mrs. Frog and a number of Baby Frogs. They lived very happily. The\r\nbooks say that frogs are tadpoles at first, and the books are right; but\r\nthis is another family of frogs, as you shall see.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of their house stretched a marsh in the shallow waters of\r\nwhich grew reeds, rushes, willows and water lilies. Here and there a\r\nbulging gnarled and knotty cypress knee raised its head above the water.\r\nHere and there rotted an old log, moss-covered and sodden. Here and\r\nthere lay a block of wood left behind by the hewers, a tuft of grass or\r\na mound of earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Frog and Mrs. Frog and all the Baby Frogs visited this marsh.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Frog and Mrs. Frog and all the Baby Frogs visited this marsh every\r\nnight. They were fond of music and they gave nightly concerts. When the\r\nsun slipped down behind the distant pines and tamarisks, and when the\r\nstars came out to glisten in the heavens, the entire family left their\r\nhome and sought the marsh.\r\n\r\nMr. Frog always swam out to a cypress knee that rose a few inches above\r\nthe water. It was broad and flat and he seemed to like to lie on it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog used to sit on a log near by and all the Baby Frogs crowded\r\naround her and tried to cuddle up to her. There was not room for all,\r\nbut the tiniest Baby Frog used to hop up on her back and lie there until\r\nit was time to go home.\r\n\r\nOne of the Baby Frogs never mingled with the rest but hid himself away\r\nin a tuft of grass. They said he was “odd.” Why he preferred the grass I\r\ncannot say. He was morose and taciturn and probably wanted to be by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOn dark nights the concert did not begin early. Mr. and Mrs. Frog and\r\nall the Baby Frogs remained quiet and watched Will-o’-the-Wisp flash his\r\nlamp about; or they listened to the cry of the witch-dog far out in the\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\nBut my story deals with the moonlight nights, and on moonlight nights\r\nthe singing began early and lasted until midnight. Some people will tell\r\nyou that frogs sing all night and they sometimes do; but only sometimes.\r\nThese same people tell you that frogs croak, but I say they sing and you\r\ncan understand and enjoy their music quite as much as some of the grand\r\noperas.\r\n\r\nMr. Frog usually began. He had a deep bass voice of which he was very\r\nproud and when he flung out a rich tremolo, every one else hushed. You\r\ncould hear him ever so far up the lakeside, and Mr. Peckerwood said he\r\nheard him on the other side of the lake.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog once had a well-trained contralto voice of which she was a\r\ntrifle proud; but of late years she had so many babies to croon for that\r\nshe got out of practice and could not sing as she once could. She knew\r\nhow to sing and she knew she couldn’t sing. And this night she sang\r\nworse than usual—she seemed out of sorts.\r\n\r\nThe “odd” Frog who went away to himself sang whenever he wanted to and\r\nin the funniest way. He did not try to make music but just rattled like\r\nan alarm clock. They let him alone because he was “odd.”\r\n\r\nAnother little Frog tried to sing, but he couldn’t. You would have\r\nlaughed, I am sure, to have heard him try. His voice sounded like a\r\npiccolo into which someone was blowing who did not know how to play.\r\n\r\nAnother Baby Frog had a splendid tenor voice, but he was always trying\r\nto sing as his papa sang. The result was that he injured his tenor voice\r\nwithout ever learning to sing bass. People very often harm themselves by\r\ntrying to do what they cannot do and by leaving undone that which they\r\ncan do.\r\n\r\nThe other singer was a Baby Frog with a beautiful soprano voice. And she\r\nsang, and sang her very best, whenever she was called on. Her singing\r\nwas the talk of the whole neighborhood and, at night, when all the Baby\r\nFrogs were asleep, Mr. and Mrs. Frog used to talk of putting by\r\nsomething with which to send her abroad and have her voice cultivated.\r\nWhether they ever did so or not I cannot say.\r\n\r\nThe night of which I am telling you, Mr. Frog jumped into the water with\r\na plunk and swam ashore, the rest following him. They returned home and\r\nMrs. Frog soon had all the little Frogs tucked away in bed. Mrs. Frog\r\nwas restless and nervous, for some reason. She would pick something off\r\nthe dresser and lay it down again, mechanically. She would move a chair\r\nthere, and in a moment set it elsewhere. She would fold her hands and\r\nsit down only to jump up in a few minutes and go hurriedly to do\r\nsomething quite unimportant.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mr. Frog, who had been out, came stumbling in quite angry and\r\ndemanded to know why the children had not brought in the kindling for\r\nthe morning’s fire, saying that he should not be left everything to do.\r\nHe did not notice the pained expression on Mrs. Frog’s face—people fail\r\nto see these things, sometimes—and he busied himself in closing up the\r\nhouse and fastening the doors and windows, after Mrs. Frog had shown him\r\nthe kindling wood in the shadow of the ingle. Mrs. Frog retired, but Mr.\r\nFrog lay with his head in the doorway until daylight, and some say that\r\nhe slept with one eye open. How any one found out I cannot tell, because\r\nMr. Frog’s house was dark as pitch and only Mr. Owl could have seen; and\r\nMr. Owl is too wise to tell anyone if he did. The reason Mr. Frog\r\nguarded the door is because Mr. Garter-snake lived in the neighborhood\r\nand Mr. Garter-snake is a prowler and likes to feast on Baby Frogs\r\nwhenever he can find them. Mr. Garter-snake goes home at daylight and\r\nnever ventures out unless it is going to rain, when he crosses the road\r\nin front of people to warn them to seek shelter. At daylight Mr. Frog\r\nturned in and slept until high noon. A bright fire was blazing on the\r\nhearth and Mrs. Frog was fixing breakfast, and the way she handled the\r\nskillets and spiders and sauce-pans, and at the same time urged the\r\nlittle Frogs to get ready for breakfast, was a caution.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over and the things cleared up, Mrs. Frog was still restless.\r\nSit still she could not. The Baby Frogs irritated her. She would go out\r\nand look about her in front of the door a moment, only to hurry back\r\nagain for nothing. Her face was pale and her eyes shone unusually. Once\r\nshe thought if she could scream it would do her great good. She was\r\nlooking and acting strangely, but Mr. Frog did not notice anything. She\r\nannounced her intention of going to visit Mrs. Rabbit who lived in the\r\nbriar patch across the lake. Mr. Frog was a little surprised but made no\r\nobjection, only observing that he hoped she would be home before sunset\r\nas he could do nothing with the Baby Frogs when they got sleepy; and\r\nthat Mr. Moccasin-snake would be on the lookout for his supper as soon\r\nas it was dark.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog put on her things and powdered her face. She looked at herself\r\nin the mirror a moment and then feverishly rushed to the bank and\r\nplunged in with a ker-plunk that could be heard a long distance. She\r\nkept deep under the water and would first swim this way and then that\r\nway; now to the right and then to the left, and she came to the surface\r\na good distance from where she entered the water so that Mr.\r\nMoccasin-snake, if he had been on a log in the sun waiting for her,\r\ncould not locate her. She looked back and saw Mrs. Turtle and Mr. Turtle\r\nasleep on a half-floating cottonwood stump, and then she struck out\r\nacross the lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  —put on her things and powdered her face.\r\n]\r\n\r\nShe had not gone far when she began to feel better. Her nervousness and\r\nfever left her. She enjoyed a sense of freedom and liberty, and the\r\ncool, clear waters were as a health-giving and soothing anodyne to her.\r\nThe sense of smothering and confinement which she found so oppressive at\r\nhome had left her, and her spirit expanded and reveled in its new-found\r\nindependence and she only regretted that Mr. Frog and the Baby Frogs\r\nwere not with her to enjoy her raptures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AT MRS. RABBIT’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\nArriving at the opposite bank, which she clambered up in no time, Mrs.\r\nFrog was feeling refreshed; she came to a road that fringed the lake,\r\nand, crossing this, she came to the briar patch. She went up and down\r\nthe road, now entering one opening in the briar patch and then another,\r\nonly to find that they were “blind” and that they led nowhere. One after\r\nanother she entered these openings and had to come out again. She was\r\nabout to give up the task and return home and she was soothing her\r\ndisappointed feelings with the reflection that while she had not found\r\nMrs. Rabbit and returned her call, she had enjoyed the outing immensely\r\nand had been benefited by the trip, when she saw a small opening nearly\r\ncovered by hanging leaves. After some hesitation she entered this and\r\nfound, to her great joy, that it was an arched pathway, well beaten by\r\ntravel, which led to the home of Mrs. Rabbit. She followed this until\r\nshe neared the house and saw Mrs. Rabbit standing in her front yard.\r\nMrs. Frog saluted her cheerily but Mrs. Rabbit pretended that she was\r\nfrightened and rushed in her house and hid in a heap in the darkest\r\ncorner. Mrs. Frog followed her in, exclaiming: “La! Mrs. Rabbit, you\r\nneed not hide. It is only Mrs. Frog that has come to see you and she is\r\nnot going to hurt you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit came out and said: “Why, Mrs. Frog, I am so glad to see you.\r\nI have been thinking of you and wondering if you never would come or if\r\nyou had quite forgotten me. You are looking so well. I really believe,\r\nMrs. Frog, that you are getting younger every day. I am sure you are\r\ngetting better looking. How is Mr. Frog and the children—the dear\r\nthings, how I would like to see them—how are they all?”\r\n\r\n“The children,” replied Mrs. Frog, “are just as dear and sweet as they\r\ncan live; and growing? You never saw the like! Why, they are perfect\r\nJonah’s gourds, one would think, to see how they grow. And they are just\r\nas bad! Not mean, you know, but just mischievous and into everything.\r\nThey run me wild, at times. But with all the trouble they give us, what\r\nwould life be without them? Dear me! This would be a sad place without\r\nchildren. I needn’t ask how you are,” continued Mrs. Frog, “because your\r\nlooks speak for themselves and tell the story of your good health and\r\nhappiness. How are the dear children and Mr. Rabbit? I suppose he is\r\nlike my old man, grumbledy and fussy, but just as good as he can be. I\r\nhope he will come in before I leave because I want to see him.”\r\n\r\nThere was an undertone of sadness in the forced mirth of Mrs. Rabbit’s\r\nvoice as she replied: “The children are all well. Now and then one of\r\nthem gets sick but it is only for a little while and it amounts to\r\nnothing. Mr. Rabbit has gone to mill with a turn of corn so that I may\r\nhave flour to make bread for Sunday dinner. We usually have a good deal\r\nof company on Sunday.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit said this with the faintest suggestion of vanity, and then\r\ncontinued: “I am sure you must be famished after your long trip across\r\nthe lake. Dear me, how I wish I could swim.” (Mrs. Rabbit was only too\r\nsincere in this.)\r\n\r\n“Spread this mullein leaf over your dress to protect it. What a pretty\r\ndress you have and it is so becoming to you. I always did like green.\r\nYour appetite must provide the relish for what I have to set before you,\r\nas I have only scraps to offer and it would keep you too long waiting to\r\ncook something fresh. Somebody once said something in praise of a dinner\r\nof herbs; but for my part, I would prefer something else.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog spread the mullein leaf over her lap and fell to with much\r\nenergy, but her thoughts were on her dress, of which she was very proud.\r\n“I am glad you like my dress,” she said. “I like it very much. I got it\r\nat a bargain, too, because I bought the goods by the quantity and made\r\ndresses of the same material for all children and had quite a lot left\r\nfor mending. Children are so hard on clothes. This dress like all the\r\nrest does not fit me. I suppose I must have an awful figure”—Mrs. Frog\r\nsaid this, but did not mean a word of it; she was really proud of her\r\nfine figure—“and the dressmakers never fit me. It is all right around\r\nthe neck but, you see, it is much too tight and binding across the bust\r\nand it is not full enough about the hips; while the waist is baggy—it is\r\nso loose, and,—dear me! if I wore corsets it would look like a meal sack\r\non a hoe handle, on me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Frog asked: “What is the news over this way?”\r\n]\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit could not see the defects mentioned and concluded they were\r\nimaginary. People frequently differ in opinion.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned to general topics and Mrs. Frog asked: “What is\r\nthe news over this way?”\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs. Rabbit: “We never hear anything in this out-of-the-way place.\r\nIt is so quiet. The overflow has caused some suffering and one of Mr.\r\nFox’s sons, who had been stealing a farmer’s chickens in the clearing,\r\nwas killed the other night and his skin is going to be worn by the\r\nfarmer’s daughter next winter to keep her neck and shoulders warm. Mr.\r\nBear’s brother, who had been killing and eating the farmer’s calves in\r\nthe canebrake, was caught in a trap and shot dead. His skin is stretched\r\non the door of the farmer’s barn and his body is hung up in the\r\nsmokehouse near by. Mr. Woodpecker brought this news to us and warned us\r\nto be on our guard because there are so many hungry animals abroad. I am\r\nafraid to let the children out of my sight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” exclaimed Mrs. Frog. “That is too bad! But you know,”\r\ncontinued Mrs. Frog, glancing furtively at her reflection in the mirror\r\nand comparing her appearance with the appearance of Mrs. Rabbit, the\r\nresult of which seemed to please her, “you know the way of the\r\ntransgressor is hard. But really I must go as it is getting late.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog jumped up and made ready to take her departure, taking at the\r\nsame time a mental inventory of everything in the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit begged her to stay longer, assured her it was quite early\r\nand that she had plenty of time to reach home, and reproached her for\r\nhurrying off. Mrs. Rabbit accompanied Mrs. Frog to the end of the path\r\nthrough the briar patch and out into the opening on the bank of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n“You must come and see me again, soon,” said Mrs. Rabbit. “Come early\r\nand spend the day and bring the children and I will keep mine home from\r\nschool and we will have a nice time.”\r\n\r\n“I am coming right soon. You cannot keep me away because I enjoy these\r\nvisits hugely. I am sorry I did not see Mr. Rabbit and the dear\r\nchildren. Now, I will not take no. You must come to see me soon; you\r\nmust.” Mrs. Frog was very emphatic.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming before long,” said Mrs. Rabbit. “I’m coming, sure. I would\r\nhave been over before this but I cannot take a short cut across the\r\nlake, like you, but must go around. And, since his son was killed, Mr.\r\nFox lives up at this end of the lake, which makes me go the long way,\r\naround the lower end. And getting through the switch-cane is a job, I\r\ntell you. When I brought home the coffee I borrowed from you it took me\r\nuntil evening to make the trip. Mr. Bear has plenty of paths through the\r\nswitch-cane, but they run all which ways and you are coming home half\r\nthe time when you think you are going; but there is no way out of it\r\nunless you could fly over it as Mr. Jaybird does when he goes over to\r\nthe deadening to tote down fire-wood for the devil on Friday mornings,\r\nand the Cotton-tail family cannot fly nor even jump like the Jackrabbit\r\nfamily. But I’ll manage to get there soon.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and kissed and Mrs. Frog plunged into the lake with a\r\nker-plunk and swimming gaily out a distance turned around and said:\r\n\r\n“You must come soon.”\r\n\r\n“I will, and you must come soon.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit watched her guest depart and when out of hearing almost\r\nhissed: “Horrid thing! I don’t see what brings her here. I wish Mr.\r\nMoccasin-snake or Mr. Hawk would come along and catch her. She just came\r\nhere to show that green dress because she knew neither myself nor my\r\nchildren have a stitch to wear but these old grey gowns trimmed with\r\nfur, and here it is the middle of summer.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit returned home just as Mr. Rabbit, who had been to mill with\r\na turn of corn to have ground into flour to make bread for Sunday\r\ndinner, turned the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MRS. FROG RETURNS HOME.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog swam rapidly over the glassy surface and she noticed that a\r\ngolden pathway led from where she was to the sun that hung low in the\r\nwest at the other end of the lake. This narrow pathway she could not\r\ncross, which alarmed her, as she fancied she was held fast by it, and\r\ncould make no headway. The ripples caused by her efforts broke this\r\ngolden mirror into many sparkling fragments; but, farther away, it lay\r\nundisturbed and placid. On looking at the trees the other side of her\r\nshe saw that she was making excellent progress and that, instead of the\r\nsun’s pathway detaining her, it was following her. Her alarm gave way to\r\ngladness at being accompanied by such a splendid convoy—people sometimes\r\nfret over the slow progress which they think they are making, when, in\r\nreality, they are traveling very fast. She eluded Mr. Hawk and Mr.\r\nMoccasin-snake by diving when near the shore and then hurrying up the\r\nbank to the door of her house. On looking back she discovered that the\r\nsun’s bright pathway did not follow her but remained below on the\r\nlake—there are places into which things that we prize will not accompany\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOn entering she found confusion and disorder. The dishes on which the\r\ncold midday meal had been served lay spread on the table. The Baby Frogs\r\nwere unkempt and disheveled and some of them were crying. The youngest\r\none had cried itself to sleep. Mr. Frog was a sight to behold. He was\r\nalmost frantic and went about tripping over bits of furniture and\r\nclothing that were strewn on the floor. His face was inflamed and he\r\ngreeted Mrs. Frog hoarsely with: “What on earth kept you so late? I\r\nthought you would never come! These children have set me almost crazy\r\nwith their mischief and carrying-on. I wouldn’t put in another day like\r\nthis for anything. You shouldn’t inflict on me such misery when I told\r\nyou to be back before night.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog’s cheeriness, gained from her outing, was something abated;\r\nbut she set about to right matters and put things in order. She reminded\r\nMr. Frog that the sun had not yet set; but he did not hear, or feigned\r\nnot to hear her. He went out and hopped down the way to Mr. Toad’s\r\nhouse, where he supped and talked about the coming election of a new\r\nking of the forest, which was growing smaller every year. Mr. Lion and\r\nMr. Tiger and Mr. Wolf had gone away and it was reported that Mr. Bear\r\nintended moving farther West because his only brother was dead. Mr.\r\nWildcat would be a candidate and so would Mr. Fox, but neither was\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mrs. Frog busied herself about the house. The Baby Frogs came\r\nout from their hiding places where they had been driven, in terror, by\r\ntheir angry father. She dried their tears and dressed them for supper\r\nwhich she prepared. Deftly she put everything in place and restored\r\norder and soon smiles and laughter returned to her little ones. She\r\nwaited supper until late and then told the Baby Frogs to eat and be\r\nready to go to the concert in the marsh when Mr. Frog came. She ate\r\nnothing. After supper she waited until far into the night and one by one\r\nthe Baby Frogs fell asleep and were put to bed. When all was still and\r\nthe fire burned low she sat holding her Baby Frog that was considered\r\n“odd” on her knee. She wondered if it were very wrong in her to go away\r\nand enjoy herself as she had done when so much unhappiness resulted. The\r\nthought came to her that Mr. Frog did not love her else he would have\r\nreflected that the crosses and trials borne by him so impatiently for\r\none day were her usual portion and that she had to bear them every day\r\nin the year and meet him pleasantly and with smiles in the evening or be\r\ncharged with ill-temper and making home unpleasant. She hugged her Baby\r\nFrog that was considered “odd” closer to her. It had taken cold, because\r\nleft to sleep without covering while she was away. Then she blamed\r\nherself and resolved never to go away again and fell to crying and\r\nupbraiding herself.\r\n\r\nVery late at night or early in the morning Mr. Frog came home in great\r\nspirits. His countenance was beaming. He had tarried late at Mrs. Toad’s\r\nhouse and halted on the way home to hear the songs of Mr. Whippoorwill\r\nand Mr. Mocking-bird, and to see the fine display given by Mr. Fire-fly.\r\nWhen he found Mrs. Frog crying he scowled at her and said gruffly:\r\n“What’s the matter now? If gadding about has this effect on you, you had\r\nbetter stay at home and not tire yourself out traipsing around seeing\r\npeople who care nothing for you.” Then he flung himself down to sleep.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frog, with her Baby Frog that was considered “odd” held close in\r\nher arms, also went to bed where her tears flowed in secret. She did not\r\nknow the meaning of those tears; they came unbidden. She fancied she had\r\ndone something very wrong and she fell asleep only when exhaustion came.\r\n\r\nIt is most unfortunate that those who make sacrifices for others are\r\nnever noticed or given credit for them and that they are cruelly\r\nreproached when those sacrifices halt, temporarily, or wholly cease. It\r\nis most unfortunate that we inflict pain on those we love, in our\r\nthoughtlessness, and that they suffer this pain without always knowing\r\nits source.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EVERYBODY WHO IS ANYBODY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Squirrel and Mrs. Squirrel were invited and were glad to accept.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Peckerwood had been abroad early. Mrs. Rabbit was going to give a\r\ndining and had commissioned him to invite her friends. Mrs. Rabbit had\r\nbaked up the entire turn of corn that Mr. Rabbit had taken to mill to\r\nprovide for Sunday’s dinner. Mr. Squirrel and Mrs. Squirrel were invited\r\nand were glad to accept and promised to attend. Mr. and Mrs. Toad were\r\ninvited but were compelled to decline. In discussing the matter among\r\nthemselves Mrs. Toad observed: “We have lived long here in our own\r\nsimple way and have never gone in society. It was a hard struggle for a\r\ntime and no one thought of us or cared for us. We have always lived at\r\npeace with our neighbors and we now have their good will; but, because\r\nwe have prospered, we have not changed our habits of life. We are\r\nold-fashioned and we would be out of place in grand society if it is as\r\nthose who have been there picture it. Of course those present would be\r\nvery kind to us and do what they could to make us feel at home; but\r\ntheir efforts would only make us sense the more keenly how unfitted we\r\nare for such company. We are unused to gaiety and fine things and we\r\nwould be at a loss to know what to do and always fearful of making\r\nmistakes. We had better remain as we are and where we are. Here we know\r\nwhat to do and how to extract simple pleasure from our surroundings.\r\nThere, everything would be new and strange and untoward.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Toad said these things not without an effort. In spite of her, she\r\nhad a curiosity to see the fine sights in the upper and polite world.\r\n\r\nMr. Toad agreed with her and added: “They used to say every Toad,\r\nhowever ugly, had a precious jewel in its head. Of late years this has\r\nbeen disputed by the wise who call themselves scientists. You, my dear,\r\nat least, vindicate the truth of the older claim. You have in your head\r\nthe precious jewel of sound sense and wise discretion.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Toad smiled and her desire to go vanished. The commendation of\r\nthose we love is always conciliating and soothing.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Frog were invited and Mrs. Frog accepted for the entire\r\nfamily. She wanted Mr. Frog and the Baby Frogs to have a pleasant outing\r\nand she was flattered by the thought that green dresses and white\r\nstomachers would look uncommonly well. Frogs could not fly, but they\r\ncould swim and dive, and that is something the birds of the air cannot\r\ndo, she mused. She began at once preparing for the event.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaybird and Mrs. Jaybird were invited by mistake and they accepted\r\ninstantly and Mrs. Jaybird flew over to Mrs. Magpie’s home and told her\r\nall about it and how she hated to go to the stupid function and be\r\nbored, as she knew she would be; but, as Everybody who is Anybody is to\r\nbe there, she presumed she would have to attend. Mrs. Magpie received no\r\ninvitation; neither did Mr. Magpie, but Mrs. Magpie flew about and told\r\nEverybody who is Nobody that _she_ would not attend such a meeting or\r\nmix in with such company, and Everybody who is Nobody commended her\r\ndiscrimination and solemnly declared that _she_ would not attend such a\r\nmeeting or mix in such company.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaver and Mrs. Beaver were invited, and Mrs. Beaver said that she\r\nwould attend to the R. S. V. P. later on. As soon as Mr. Peckerwood was\r\nout of sight she came out of her house and slapped the water with her\r\nflat tail, producing a sharp sound that could be heard a long distance.\r\nMr. Beaver, who was cutting into convenient lengths a tree he had felled\r\nthe day previous, so that he could roll it down the bank and use it in\r\nstrengthening the dam in front of his house, plunged into the water and\r\ndived down to the door of his stronghold in alarm, thinking serious\r\ndanger impended and that the noise was the usual warning given by the\r\nsentinels. He was met by Mrs. Beaver, whose face was lit up and smiling,\r\nand who exclaimed: “What do you think! We have been invited to a dining\r\nat Mrs. Rabbit’s and we are sure to have a good time. Everybody who is\r\nAnybody will be there, and I don’t think we will have to take a back\r\nseat for any of them. It is rather warm for furs, but it is late in the\r\nseason, and—furs are always furs.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Beaver was radiant and enthusiastic and she looked proudly at her\r\nsleek coat, from which the water had almost disappeared.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaver looked at her for a while before he spoke, loth to lessen the\r\npleasure she found in anticipating so great an event, and then he kindly\r\nbut firmly said: “I do not like to differ from you. I dislike to.\r\nNevertheless, I do not think it is wise in us to attend Mr. Rabbit’s\r\ndining. It is flattering to be invited to the tables of the great, but\r\nit is unwise to accept attentions that cannot be returned. To return\r\nsuch a compliment we are in no way prepared. To accept it would put us\r\nunder an obligation that we could not discharge, and we would be\r\ncarrying the burden of a debt we could not pay. Mr. Rabbit is wealthy.\r\nHe has a broad briar patch in which he is safe, and into which not even\r\nMr. Rattlesnake can enter. He has an abundance of clover and sweet\r\ngrasses and tender buds at his door and his home is spacious. But these\r\nhe neither created, produced nor builded. They were given him, and he\r\nhas no other interest in them save possession. With us, what we have we\r\nproduced by our own efforts. We cut down and hauled trees and fashioned\r\nhouses and dams. We are our own architect and builder. Unlike some\r\nanimals who claim to be much wiser than we and who design and build\r\nhouses for other people, while going homeless themselves, we provided\r\nfor ourselves and what we have is our own. So long as we guard it and\r\ncontinue our custom of healthy, hard work, we will be happy. As soon as\r\nwe leave our narrow sphere we will meet trouble. Our bodies are covered\r\nwith rich fur that is seasonable enough, but our tails are covered with\r\nscales, and strange company would not know how to take us. They could\r\nnot make flesh of one and fish of the other.” As he said this Mr. Beaver\r\nfelt much pleased with his own fluent rhetoric.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beaver, who had listened glumly, was silenced but not convinced.\r\nShe puffed up and said nothing. Her heart was set on going to the\r\ndining, and no argument could change her. And the misery of it all was\r\nher silence. Had she said something or done something; had she talked\r\nback, or thrown a billet of wood at Mr. Beaver, it would have been a\r\nrelief to him. But she merely _looked_ and said nothing, and this was\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaver returned moodily to his work, feeling that his philosophy was\r\nweak and useless, and that there are times when it is better to be\r\nunwisely happy than to be unhappily wise.\r\n\r\nMr. Chipmunk and Mrs. Chipmunk were invited. Mr. Swamp Rabbit and Mrs.\r\nSwamp Rabbit were invited. Mr. Otter and Mrs. Otter were invited. Mr.\r\nMink and Mrs. Mink were invited. Mr. Groundhog and Mrs. Groundhog were\r\ninvited; but Mr. Groundhog excused himself, saying that he was afraid of\r\nlosing his shadow and becoming like the unfortunate Peter Schlemihl in\r\nthe story. Mr. and Mrs. Kildee, Mr. and Mrs. Redbird, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSparrow, Mr. and Mrs. Dove, Mr. and Mrs. Quail were invited and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Humming-bird promised to look in on the company. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nThrush were invited, but announced that they could not sing, as they\r\nwere under contract, unless paid for it, or unless their manager, Mr.\r\nWildcat, was bidden as a guest, which, of course, could not be thought\r\nof. All members of the Mocking-bird family were invited, and Mr.\r\nMocking-bird promised to bring his music, providing Mr. and Mrs. Linnet\r\nwere not of the party. Mr. Parrot and Mrs. Parrot and Mr. Goose and Mrs.\r\nGoose were on the list to be invited; but they were later removed for\r\nfear the one would repeat everything that was said and the other would\r\ntalk and gabble so much that nothing could be said. Mr. Rabbit suggested\r\ninviting Mr. Stork and Mrs. Stork, old friends of the family, but Mrs.\r\nRabbit said that while they would be welcome as far as _she_ was\r\nconcerned, she knew that many of her friends who go much in society\r\nwould object.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed all the guests attended and it was a goodly\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EVERYBODY WHO IS NOBODY.\r\n\r\nAs the invited guests arrived, some coming by water, some by land, and\r\nsome through the air—Mr. Squirrel and Mrs. Squirrel came through the\r\ntops of the trees, sometimes jumping long distances from the limbs of\r\none to the limbs of another—Everybody who is Nobody crowded around the\r\nentrance to the briar patch. Everybody who is _No_body had no tickets of\r\nadmission, but they surrounded the guests, and would have crowded in,\r\nuninvited, were it not that Mr. ’Possum, with a large detachment of his\r\nkinsmen, acted as policemen and drove them back. In spite of this and in\r\nspite of the harsh means used to keep the crowd back, some of the guests\r\nwere jostled, crushed and injured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. ’Possum acted as policeman and drove them back.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEverybody who is _No_body retired a short distance to a little knoll\r\nthat had been flung up by the uprooting of a great tree that had long\r\nsince rotted away. Everybody who is _No_body was anxious to appear on\r\nthe ground by mere accident; but Mr. Owl, who was looking on from a high\r\ntree, knew they were all impelled by the same motive.\r\n\r\nMr. Muskrat and Mrs. Muskrat concluded early in the day that they had\r\nopened more mussel shells than was really necessary, and that they might\r\nas well take a walk and enjoy a holiday. They were the first to climb to\r\nthe top of the knoll, to dry their clothing, they said. Mr. Polecat and\r\nMrs. Polecat, Mr. Porcupine and Mrs. Porcupine, Mr. Turtle and Mrs.\r\nTurtle, Mr. Weasel and Mrs. Weasel, Mr. Hawk and Mrs. Hawk, Mr. Gopher\r\nand Mrs. Gopher, and, in fact, Everybody who is Nobody was there. Mr.\r\nBuzzard and Mrs. Buzzard started on the way, but they were attracted by\r\nthe odor arising from a carrion that lay rotting far out on the\r\nfestering marsh. Mr. Rattlesnake and Mrs. Rattlesnake remained a short\r\ndistance away—there are exclusive folk in society where Everybody is\r\nNobody—and Mr. Rattlesnake made the buttons on his tail sound like a\r\nfire of musketry when things did not suit him. Mr. Magpie and Mrs.\r\nMagpie were dressed early and ready to go, but Mrs. Magpie began\r\ngossiping with Mr. Crane, who had just swallowed Mr. Garter-snake and\r\nprevented _him_ from going, and she forgot all about it until too late.\r\nMr. Fox approached very cautiously to where he could hear and to where\r\nhe could not be seen. Mr. Tarantula blundered in, but, discovering his\r\nmistake, retired at once.\r\n\r\nWhen all were assembled, Mrs. Muskrat observed that she was glad that\r\n_she_ was not in the briar patch at the dining. She knew she could have\r\nbeen invited if she had put herself in the way of it as some other folks\r\nhave done; but she had no use for Mrs. Rabbit. Mrs. Rabbit put on a\r\ngreat many airs. She considered herself better than other people. She\r\nshouldn’t forget that she married Mr. Rabbit, who is old enough to be\r\nher father, for his property, and that, when she married him, she had\r\nnothing but the clothes on her back. And since her marriage she has been\r\ngiven but one new dress a year in spite of all her wealth. Mrs. Muskrat\r\naverred that she believed in taking people for what they are and not for\r\nwhat their ancestors were, and for which they should be in no way held\r\naccountable; still, it was commonly known that Mrs. Rabbit’s grandmother\r\nhired out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Porcupine ventured to say that it might be well enough to be an old\r\nman’s darling, if he had money enough; but she did not believe in\r\nbecoming the slave of a house full of little ones, and the way Mrs.\r\nRabbit was surrounding herself with olive branches was positively\r\nscandalous, and the talk of the entire forest.\r\n\r\nMr. Porcupine had been listening to the talk, and knowing that he had to\r\nagree with his wife, laughed immoderately and applauded loudly. Other\r\nanimals have found it wise and expedient to do the same thing. In doing\r\nthis his quills penetrated the fur coat of Mrs. Polecat, who indignantly\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Sir! I would have you remember in whose presence you find yourself. You\r\nshould select a more willing target for your murderous weapons.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mrs. Polecat,” said Mr. Porcupine, not knowing the injury he had\r\ndone—some people never know the injury they do—“You possess a weapon and\r\nwield it so effectively that it is much more cruel and painful than is\r\nmy poor quill. Mine is a sword stab, but there are torments and\r\nsufferings greater than sword stabs.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Mr. Porcupine thought it an uncommonly fine speech with\r\nan obvious meaning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Polecat was placated. Her anger was turned to pleasure. She, too,\r\nthought it an uncommonly fine speech, and fancied that it meant that her\r\nbeauty was such as to inspire love and destroy the heart and peace of\r\nmind of those who saw her. There are people in this world who are always\r\nready to take a veiled censure of a fault which they possess as a\r\ncompliment to an assumed virtue which they do not possess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Porcupine frowned and scowled. She knew what Mr. Porcupine meant,\r\nbut she frowned and scowled because Mrs. Polecat had misunderstood it\r\nand had taken it as a compliment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Turtle, who had been waiting for a chance to speak, said she didn’t\r\nsee how any one could go about without reasonable protection. For her\r\npart, she was not afraid of Mr. Porcupine’s quills, and she invited him\r\nto come as close to her as he desired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Porcupine frowned and scowled again, and no doubt a pitched battle\r\nwould have ensued, had not Mr. Rattlesnake sounded an alarm, and slipped\r\naway under a huge rock.\r\n\r\nJust then two hunters, with their dogs, rode up, and—bang! bang!—Mr.\r\nPorcupine and Mrs. Muskrat fell over dead. The younger hunter took out\r\nafter Mr. Polecat and Mrs. Polecat, but he was warned back by the elder,\r\nwho said that, like some people, the Polecats had methods of assault\r\nagainst which there is no defense excepting distance, and that the part\r\nof wisdom is to keep well away from them.\r\n\r\nMr. Turtle and Mrs. Turtle, in spite of their strong armor, were\r\ncaptured and hung by whang leather thongs to the horns of the hunters’\r\nsaddles. Their heads were battered, but of course they did not die until\r\nput in the soup-pot the next day. Mr. Hawk and Mrs. Hawk flew away and\r\nthe rest of the animals escaped with more or less injury, one way and\r\nanother, with the exception of Mr. Weasel, who was killed and his skin\r\nconverted into a purse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Rabbit put on a great many airs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was many and many a long day before Everybody who is Nobody met again\r\nto criticise their neighbors. It sometimes requires a great catastrophe\r\nto teach a valuable lesson; but, once learned, this lesson is not soon\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MRS. RABBIT’S DINING.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit’s home was a delight to see when the guests arrived. Mrs.\r\nRabbit was a trifle tired and apprehensive. It was her first formal\r\nfunction and she did not know how many “regrets” were in store for her.\r\n(Some she knew would come, but others whom she desired to lionize gave\r\nher concern. Their absence would mean disappointment and humiliation. If\r\nsome benign power would remove all the empty chairs from around the\r\ntable of a hostess who has made elaborate preparations for the\r\nentertainment of guests who do not come, and who is not wholly certain\r\nof her approaches, some of the bitterest sorrows would be removed from\r\nearth and many a heart-break would be escaped. Such a spectacle,\r\npresented to a hostess, not only stuns and stings, but corrodes.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit was not long in suspense. Her guests came, every one of\r\nthem, came in a crowd, and each one had something to tell about the\r\nescape from Everybody who is Nobody at the entrance to the briar patch,\r\nall of which pleased Mrs. Rabbit greatly.\r\n\r\nMr. Toad and Mrs. Toad were not expected. Mr. Beaver and Mrs. Beaver\r\nwere not missed. They were working people, and working people are seldom\r\nmuch sought after until they cease working and become representatives of\r\nworking people.\r\n\r\nMr. Peckerwood was seen coming from far away across the lake. He would\r\nsoar high up in the air, remain poised an instant, and then plunge\r\nheadlong downward until near the earth, when he would gracefully glide\r\nupward again. He moved as a light vessel moves across high billows\r\nbetween which there are great troughs or valleys, now on the crest of\r\nthe wave, now in the deep chasm. He came on with a freedom and a swing,\r\ndescribing a series of parabolas that were beautiful to behold.\r\n\r\nOn arriving he informed the party that an important engagement, he was\r\nsorry to say, prevented him from remaining; but he would beat the drum\r\non a hollow tree from time to time to let them know where he was in the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nEvery one was sorry, and Mr. Otter remarked that he always noticed that\r\nthose who take the most active part in movements for good, and who do\r\nmost to bring these movements to a splendid result, seldom enjoy the\r\nbenefits and pleasures of their efforts. They sow and others garner.\r\nThey build and others occupy. They provide and others enjoy.\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence Mr. Mink said that he had observed the same thing,\r\nand, according to his way of thinking, it is small compensation to see\r\nthat those who take the most active part in movements for evil, and who\r\ndo the most to bring these movements to a climax, always escape before\r\nthe explosion comes and leave their followers and dupes to suffer the\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThis is all that Mr. Mink and Mr. Otter said until time to bid their\r\nhosts good-bye, and it is a great deal for either Mr. Mink or Mr. Otter\r\nto say at any time, and especially on this subject, which, perhaps, had\r\nbetter not be discussed on so joyous an occasion.\r\n\r\nThe evening was a pleasant one. Everyone present was delighted. Mr.\r\nMocking-bird sang his sweetest. He had no rival and few capable critics,\r\nand he had the musical program all to himself. Mr. Frog thought and felt\r\nsecretly that he could furnish a pleasing variation with one of his\r\nfavorite bass solos, and Mrs. Frog was sure that if her Baby Frog of the\r\nsoprano voice were given musical advantages she would take the shine out\r\nof any singer in the forest; but they were both too well bred to say\r\nanything. Mr. Frog, indeed, chimed in with his bass once or twice, with\r\nan stave or two, on the last line of the stanza, which he fancied helped\r\nmatters along famously; but, as he led the applause by crying out\r\n“Bravo,” he excited no comment.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was bountiful and of such variety as to furnish each guest\r\nthat which he or she most desired—from great fish for Mr. Otter and Mrs.\r\nOtter to blooming hollyhocks for Mr. Humming-bird and Mrs. Humming-bird.\r\nCurious delicacies were served in tiny buttercups and in pale-tinted\r\nmorning-glories that had been kept in the dark and had not closed their\r\neyes. Corn was provided for Mr. Jaybird and Mrs. Jaybird from\r\n“volunteer” stalks that grew in the farmer’s cotton patch near by.\r\nAssorted nuts of excellent flavor were furnished Mr. Squirrel and Mrs.\r\nSquirrel, and those who liked this kind of food.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rabbit laid great store by her bread, of which she was very proud.\r\nIt was not sliced and laid within reach of her guests, as is usually\r\ndone. Mrs. Rabbit put her left arm around a huge loaf, which she pressed\r\nfirmly against her breast and, with a knife in the other hand moved\r\nabout from guest to guest, cutting and serving each in turn with a\r\ngenerous piece. As each guest politely praised her cooking and\r\nhousewifery her face beamed with pleasure, and she forgot all about her\r\nold grey gown with its fur trimmings. The pleasure she felt she\r\ncommunicated to those around her, and all were supremely happy until a\r\nbecoming hour for departure.\r\n\r\nThe guests went their several ways after many good-byes and promises to\r\nmeet again, and each was in the best of spirits. The day was long\r\nremembered in the forest.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests had gone and the little ones had cuddled down in bed\r\nMrs. Rabbit confessed that while she was tired, she had never enjoyed\r\nherself as much in her life and, she added, “I never thought our\r\nneighbors were such charming people. They all seemed delighted and\r\nhappy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rabbit had eaten bountifully and was somewhat drowsy and his\r\nphilosophy may not have been wholly sound. Nevertheless, he said with\r\nmuch gravity and deliberation: “Happiness is what the learned ones call\r\na personal equation. It rests largely with ourselves. Those who\r\nselfishly seek it never find it. Those who give it to others find their\r\nown store increasing in exact proportion to the amount they dispense.\r\nHappiness is like the purse of Fortunatus that could never be emptied.\r\nYou were proud of your bread and with reason. It proved that you could\r\ndo one thing well and whoso does one thing well is master of many\r\nthings. When you sought to make others happy you found no trouble. In\r\nmaking others happy lies concealed the secret of our own happiness. Your\r\nneighbors have not changed only as you have changed them. The change is\r\nin yourself. Whenever you feel morose, despondent and unhappy, set about\r\nto do some one some good and joy will return; because doing good to\r\nothers is life’s chief luxury, and it never palls.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Mrs. Rabbit was nodding, but Mr. Rabbit did not notice it,\r\nso interested was he in his own wisdom and so charmed by his own\r\neloquence. After a slight pause they both retired to enjoy a sweet and\r\nrefreshing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                SUNSHINE\r\n\r\n                   CONDUCTED BY THE EDITOR IN CHIEF.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GREETING.\r\n\r\nHope leads the builders of this magazine to believe that its explosion\r\ncan be prevented by filling it with sugar instead of dynamite.\r\n\r\nWe propose to gather our cane mostly from Southern fields and run it\r\nthrough Southern cane mills and sweeten as much of the world as possible\r\nfrom Southern sugar barrels; but of course our doors are open to\r\nNorthern bees, Eastern butterflies, and Western humming-birds, and\r\nsuckers from everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe believe that sugar is better for the world than dynamite, and we\r\npropose to barrel it in bulk so that every boy and girl who loves to\r\nread a sweet story may dive into our columns with both hands and shout\r\nas the boy did when he got into the sure enough sugar hogshead, “O, for\r\na thousand tongues!” so that every old literary bug who sighs for the\r\nsweeter side of life may gambol among our granulated tropes and\r\npulverized similes and dream that he is the beautifulest ant in the\r\nsugar bowl.\r\n\r\nThe journalistic market is glutted with explosives, it is overstocked\r\nwith poisoned arrows. We believe in the philosophy that “More flies are\r\ncaught with sugar than with vinegar.”\r\n\r\nBut while this magazine shall be a colossal sugar lump, yet its\r\nmanagement has a whole squadron of torpedo boats, and a huge quiver of\r\narrows for all the enemies of the South and a stupendous tank of vinegar\r\nas large as all the tanks of the Standard Oil Company for the spiteful\r\nspiders and blue-bottle flies of sectional journalism. But these weapons\r\nshall never be used so long as sugar will melt in the mouths of men and\r\npersuade unrighteousness to bridle its tongue.\r\n\r\nWith these sweet sentiments upon our lips we stand on the tallest tower\r\nof our castle in the air and with our politest bow toss a large sugar\r\nlump of greeting to every one who is wise enough to subscribe for BOB\r\nTAYLOR’S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Fly in Your Own Firmament.\r\n\r\nWhen downy-lipped youth first begins to peep through the knothole in the\r\ntemple of knowledge, he is the happiest of all mortals because his\r\nvanity is unbridled and free.\r\n\r\nHe knows it all. When he “orates” on commencement day he robs the\r\ngardens of rhetoric and twines their choicest flowers about the\r\nbeautiful, but hollow and flimsy columns of his speech. He misquotes the\r\nclassic poets and taxes the old philosophers with things they never\r\nsaid. He twists the tail of history, strangles science, and spouts\r\nwisdom never dreamed of by Solomon. His impassioned sentences are chains\r\nof gold with blazing diamonds strung, and his tropes and similes cavort\r\nlike flaming meteors athwart the intellectual heavens. But after he\r\nleaves the classic halls of college, and after a few hard bumps against\r\nthe rock walls of reality, and a few hard falls on the ice pond of\r\nexperience, his self-conceit springs a leak, his immense learning oozes\r\nout, and his dream of kinship with the gods vanishes into the limbo of\r\nthe forever forgotten like a sweet scent before a high wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  His vanity is un’ridled and free.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnd so runs the endless story of callow youth—a comedy of errors\r\nreenacted by each successive generation, in whose quips and cranks and\r\nboyish antics we see ourselves repeated as in a mirror, and we only\r\nlaugh and wish that youth might last forever—we laugh and enjoy its\r\nbeautiful vanities.\r\n\r\nBut our laughter melts into sighs as we recall the Persian poet’s\r\nplaintive lines:\r\n\r\n          “Ah! that spring should vanish with the rose,\r\n          That youth’s sweet scented manuscript should close!”\r\n\r\nTime but dissipates each rapturous dream, and the revelation of our\r\nignorance comes with the experience of riper years. Only once are we the\r\nproud possessors of all knowledge and all wisdom, and this is in the\r\ndreamy days of life’s happy morning. And yet, we never lose our\r\nself-conceit as we advance in years; we only adjust our vanity to the\r\nknowledge we acquire. We learn how to dodge some of the jagged walls of\r\ntrouble and to avoid some of the mud holes of calamity; but vanity still\r\nlures us on in myriad paths of folly. Its most dangerous form is that\r\nwhich conjures in men the delusion that they know _everything_, and that\r\nthey can turn from one field of effort to another without disturbing\r\ntheir equilibrium and gather fruits and flowers with equal success from\r\nall alike. This is the snag upon which so many little kites get hung.\r\n\r\nAs no single honey-bee can rob all the flowers of the land, so no one\r\nmind can master all branches of knowledge. Nature has endowed humanity\r\nwith different aptitudes for different lines of labor. Indeed, she seems\r\nto delight in infinite diversity. Ever true to this wonderful impulse of\r\nvariation she confers on mankind intellectual gifts as multiform as her\r\nflowers—flinging them into the hovel as freely as into the palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A hard fall on the ice pond of experience.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne individual has the gift of speech, another the gift of thought. One\r\ntalks without thinking, another thinks without talking. One man sees,\r\nhears and notes everything; another sees and hears, but notes nothing.\r\nHe cannot recall whether he has been alive for the past hour or not; and\r\nif his wife asks him what manner of gown Mrs. So-and-so wore last night\r\nat the reception, he could not tell for the life of him whether she wore\r\nany gown at all. One touches business and it turns to gold; another\r\ntouches it, and it turns to rags. One touches the button of politics,\r\nand the doors of office fly open with a national hymn in their hinges;\r\nanother presses it, and the doors fly open to his competitor. One youth\r\nwhispers a magical word into the listening ear of a laughing girl and\r\nlo! her little head of auburn curls falls upon his shoulder; another\r\nyouth whispers the same word to the same girl and lo! his head falls\r\ninto the sawdust! One fair maiden sings as gloriously as a lark in June\r\nskies; another thinks she sings, but doesn’t—she only screams, and her\r\ntrills are a cross between a fife and a cane-mill as she twists her neck\r\nand walls her eyes like a dying swan.\r\n\r\nBut there is scarcely a human being under the sun who is not blessed\r\nwith some special gift of mind for the achievement of success in some\r\nspecial field of endeavor.\r\n\r\nA good old farmer and his wife had four sons, and they believed that\r\nthree of them possessed talent which would some day make them great. But\r\nwhen they came to poor John, the youngest of the flock, they agreed that\r\nhe was a natural born fool. Finally a sudden light beamed in the old\r\nman’s face and with melody in his voice he said: “Nancy, I can say one\r\nthing for John; he’s the best whistler that ever twisted wind into\r\nmusic—by gum.” Here was nature’s compensation for lack of brains—for\r\nJohn was endowed with a talent which is esteemed, in these modern days,\r\nas one of the rarest among men—a talent which might some day make John a\r\nsort of Eolian Orpheus whose slightest breath would open to him the door\r\nof fame; for have we not recently read in the public prints of a\r\nwhistling artist in the person of a charming young woman who has taken\r\nthe music loving world by storm and whistled herself into the choir of a\r\nrich and fashionable church?\r\n\r\nHow the hearts of the young male worshipers must thrill and palpitate\r\nwhen she puckers her pouting lips to join in the sacred anthem. It must\r\nbe like the nectared melody of the nightingale dripping and tinkling\r\nfrom the heart of a puckered rose.\r\n\r\nMany a dull and sluggish youth, blinded by vanity, is to-day frittering\r\naway the golden hours in some law college or medical school, who is\r\ntotally incapable by birth of ever grasping or assimilating the\r\nprinciples of law or medicine, while under the leaf-fat of his stupid\r\nbrain some talent may lie sleeping, which, if aroused and called into\r\nfull play, might elevate him to the pedestal of glory as the champion\r\nwhistler of the world.\r\n\r\nThe man of one talent, if he develops and uses it intelligently, is\r\nalways the highest example of success, even in the humblest sphere. The\r\nbootblack in the street, who, by his masterful touch, makes your shoes\r\nreflect the sun, is as much an artist in his sphere and entitled to as\r\nmuch credit as the man who made the shoes. The difficulty is that we\r\noften rebel against Nature’s purpose, which if followed always leads to\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt is an old saying that “Fortune is fickle,” but there is not much\r\ntruth in the proverb. The trouble lies in the fact that human nature is\r\nfickle and full of vanity; and we dream ourselves into the belief that\r\nwe can win applause in roles of life for which we have neither talent\r\nnor adaptation. This is vanity, and the logical result is—limbs of the\r\nlaw all leafless and briefless and weeping alone; business ventures\r\ndodging the sheriff and sighing for a lodge in some vast wilderness;\r\nmedical aspiration hopeless and patientless in the valley of dry bones;\r\nliterary spirit with broken wings and tail feathers gone; and political\r\nambition with black eye and broken nose, sighing and singing wherever he\r\ngoes:\r\n\r\n                        “I am nobody’s darling,\r\n                        Nobody cares for me.”\r\n\r\nWhen a young man comes to choose a vocation in life let him buck-and-gag\r\nvanity and enter the field for which he is best adapted. Let him analyze\r\nand synthesize himself and approximate as nearly as possible the\r\ncapacity of his mental powers. Let him study his own talent as he would\r\nstudy a book and when he has determined upon his calling let him pursue\r\nit without the shadow of turning, and he will surely win.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Governor.\r\n\r\nA good woman is the embodiment of man’s dream of the beautiful; a mean\r\none is a perpetual nightmare. They are the two extremes of melody and\r\ndiscord, of wine and vinegar, of violet and volcano in every station in\r\nlife. All men stand with uncovered heads in the presence of a good\r\nwoman. Her prudence and modesty, her gentleness and purity, are her\r\nshields from the low and vulgar; they are the heralds of her virtue and\r\ninnocence; they charm in her voice, they beam in her eyes, they are\r\neloquent in her actions and mingle and shine in the graces of her life.\r\nShe is the governor of every happy home and her throne is built of human\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nA mean woman revels in strife and in the anguish of those around her.\r\nShe delights in the abuse of others and in mysterious actions that breed\r\nsuspicion. Treason lurks in her very eyes, the tracks of treachery are\r\nin her every smile and her bosom cloaks a dagger.\r\n\r\nA good woman often weeps and her soul is sometimes tossed with righteous\r\nindignation; but she knows how to pity and to forgive. Sometimes she is\r\ncompelled to combat a wicked and self-willed husband, and to suffer the\r\nstings of his tyranny and injustice; but when her virtues and goodness\r\nassert themselves and the governor stamps her foot and demands her\r\nrights she can always subdue him and lead him like a lamb.\r\n\r\nBut let a mean woman be installed as governor of the household, and on\r\nthe slightest provocation her eyes will flame with fury, an ashy pallor\r\nwill mantle her funnel face and she will roar like an approaching\r\ncyclone; forked lightnings will leap from her frenzied tongue and strike\r\neverybody and everything for miles and miles around; her shivering\r\nhusband is usually the victim, whether guilty or innocent,\r\n\r\n           And there’s nothing left, when the heavens clear,\r\n           But skin and hair in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe chasm of calamity into which many an unwary lover falls in the leap\r\nof matrimony is his ignorance of the woman who takes this leap with him.\r\nShe conjures him into the belief that she is an angel of light and\r\nworthy to govern the world, when in reality she is a ferocious feline\r\nfrom away back, a pussy of despair from the night’s Plutonian shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Forked lightnings leap from her frenzied tongue.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany a good woman, on the other hand, is deceived and cajoled by her\r\nsuitor into the faith that he is a saint on earth, a sweet spirit of\r\nprayer, and fit only for the companionship of the seraphim and cherubim,\r\nwhen, in fact, he is a carrion crow from far away, a beautiful buzzard\r\nfrom Paradise Bay.\r\n\r\nHappiness follows in the footsteps of a good woman as the flowers follow\r\nin the footsteps of June; and laughter hand in hand with tears greets\r\nher every day. All the pure and beautiful ideals of the heart, all the\r\nchaste and tender emotions of the soul are her priceless jewels. Her\r\nlife is a willing sacrifice, and she passes from the morning to the\r\nevening with blessings upon her lips and the light of peace and joy in\r\nher shining train. She is the star that eclipses every sun and dispels\r\nthe darkness of every cloud. But it is hard to foretell results in the\r\nMonte Carlo of love. He who ventures there is playing a hazardous game\r\nand should not bet too high, for it is surely a game of chance.\r\nSometimes hearts are trumps, alas, sometimes clubs! Infatuation often\r\nstacks the cards, the intoxication of overweening confidence sometimes\r\ndims the player’s eyes, and even what seems to be a winning hand may\r\nquickly lose the game. But blessed is the gambler in the perilous game\r\nof marriage who wins a good woman for she is the richest stake ever won\r\nby man in this world. She is the handmaid of the Lord, establishing his\r\nkingdom in the home and linking earth to heaven every day.\r\n\r\nWithout her, nations would fall and civilizations crumble; without her,\r\nall the suns and moons of love would darken and all the stars of hope\r\nforget to shine; without her, charity would lose its sweetness, mercy\r\nits tenderness and sentiment its very life; without her, the genius of\r\nPhidias and Praxiteles never would have glorified the marble; Raphael\r\nand Angelo never would have dreamed in immortal colors; Burns never\r\nwould have written his sweetest lyrics of love, and the dreams of\r\nShakespeare never would have blossomed into song; without her, home,\r\nhappiness and family ties would be but mockeries and the Christian\r\nreligion itself would perish among its worshipers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Lieutenant Governor.\r\n\r\nThe brightest stars in the crown of civilization are its pure and\r\nvirtuous homes. They reflect the wealth, the power and the glory of the\r\nstate and the nation. They are the culmination of man’s highest ideals\r\nof peace and love and perfect happiness beneath the stars that shine\r\nabove him.\r\n\r\nWithin the hallowed walls of every home where children dwell, there is a\r\ncommonwealth of prattling science and toddling art and mewling music in\r\nits mother’s arms. Dimpled genius, with heaven in his eyes, is playing\r\naround many a hearthstone to-day; and under many an humble roof love is\r\nrocking the cradle of a poet or an orator; heroes of the future are\r\nfighting cob battles in the barn yard and statesmen of the years to come\r\nare ruling republics and empires on the play ground of the public school\r\nor in the society hall of the university.\r\n\r\nIn every well regulated home the governor of each commonwealth wears\r\ndresses and the lieutenant governor wears pantaloons. The wife reigns\r\nsupreme. Her scepter is her slipper, under whose swing and sway juvenile\r\ncivilization often worms and squirms, firmly held across her lap face\r\ndownward; and one shake of the scepter thoroughly subdues the lieutenant\r\ngovernor. ’Tis well! for what right has he to butt into policies of home\r\nrule and to stick his nose into the prerogatives of petticoat\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nA good husband’s dominion lies beyond the boundary line of the home. He\r\nis supreme in the office, the shop or at the plow handles. His province\r\nis to provide revenue and to fill the flour barrel. He must receive his\r\nreward in the golden coin of kisses and in the exercise of the high\r\nprivilege of paying all bills, obeying all commands, and acknowledging\r\nhis eternal loyalty and devotion to the flounced and powdered governor.\r\nIt is only in her absence from home that he becomes great and seizes the\r\nopportunity to exercise his veto power. Instantly all dusting and\r\nsweeping cease until he leaves the house for a stroll; all romping and\r\nfrolicking and sliding down the banisters come to a standstill; all\r\npracticing on the piano is suspended; and the changing of sheets and\r\npillowslips and putting rooms in order except once a week, are abolished\r\nas nuisances. The acting governor reforms everything but his appetite.\r\nHe taps the exchequer and every meal must be a banquet at the peril of\r\nthe cook’s tenure of office. His reign is brief but glorious, and\r\nbusiness is dispatched in a hurry with the view of the early return of\r\nthe slippered and skirted governor. His old cronies flock into his\r\ntouseled and disordered bedroom every night to share his limitless\r\nliberty and his boundless bonhomie. And often the jubilant uproar is\r\npunctuated with the popping of corks and the clinking of glasses, while\r\nthe ceaseless rattle of poker chips emphasizes the ancient proverb that\r\n\r\n                         “When the cat’s away,\r\n                         The mice will play.”\r\n\r\nAnd so each little domestic commonwealth has its lights and shadows, its\r\nups and downs, and its seasons of mal-administration. But when the real\r\ngovernor again assumes the reins of power, a good husband, if he has\r\nbeen guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors in office during her\r\nabsence, repents in sackcloth and ashes, and a good wife, after a\r\ncurtain lecture and a cry, always exercises the pardoning power and\r\nrestores the lieutenant governor to his former prestige and favor with\r\nthe powers that be, and again “all goes merry as a marriage bell.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Wandering in strange and unknown pastures of romance.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA good husband has his faults and foibles, and sometimes falls from\r\ngrace; but he is the salt of the earth when properly managed.\r\n\r\nA mean husband is either a Nero or a zero; he either dethrones his wife\r\nin the home and stabs his helpless and innocent little ones with curses\r\nand cruelty, or starves them with cold neglect. He rules with sneers\r\ninstead of smiles—with blows instead of blessings, or strangles laughter\r\nand love in his home with drunkenness and debauchery. How many wives\r\nwalk the floor every night waiting for footsteps they dread to hear! How\r\nmany children shiver in their rags and watch for brutal and improvident\r\nfathers. God pity the home of the man who staggers out of the path of\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\nA good man goes out into the world and bears the burdens of life with a\r\nwilling heart. If virtue sanctifies his home and peace and contentment\r\nlaugh and sing around his hearthstone, there is no anguish he will not\r\nendure for the happiness of his children, there is no agony he will not\r\nsuffer for the sake of his wife, no sin of hers he will not condone save\r\none, and that is disloyalty.\r\n\r\nMany a fortune has been lost in the lottery of love by drawing the wrong\r\nticket. Many a sweet home has been broken up and many a guiltless man\r\nhas been butted to death by the billy goat of Ananias as a penalty for\r\nunwittingly wandering in strange and unknown pastures of Romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Commercial Traveler.\r\n\r\nCommercial travelers are the Eden builders of the world; they are the\r\nevangels of human happiness; they carry heavens of pure delight in their\r\nsample cases.\r\n\r\nThere are heavens of music in the rustle of their silks, heavens of the\r\nbeautiful in their laces and lawns, heavens of rapture in their spring\r\nbonnets and jewels.\r\n\r\nThey are the tidal waves of commerce, the rolling billows of progress,\r\nthe trade winds of civilization. They touch all shores and never cease\r\nto blow.\r\n\r\nMany a castle builder presses their fragrant havanas to his lips and his\r\ndreams turn to curling castles in the air. Many a dreamer sips their\r\nmellow wines and lo! a thousand fairies with jeweled wings flutter in\r\nhis veins and flit among the flowers in the garden of his dreams.\r\n\r\nWherever the commercial travelers swarm there is honey in the gum and\r\nthe flowers of prosperity are in bloom. They carry the pollen-dust of\r\nbusiness on their wings and the honey of wealth in their grips. And\r\nwhenever they cease to hum about a town it is a sure sign that\r\nprosperity is a withered blossom there and that there are weevils in the\r\ngum.\r\n\r\nThe garden spider weaves her web among the honeysuckles and spins as she\r\nweaves without distaff or loom. She stretches her radial warp of silvery\r\nfilaments and then lays on her woof. From the center outward she glides\r\nin one continuous spiral, and as she crosses each radius of the warp she\r\ntouches it deftly with her foot as if to weld the viscid fiber.\r\n\r\nAnd thus her shining net grows until it hangs suspended in the air, half\r\nvisible, half vanishing, like some phantom wheel of moonbeams.\r\n\r\nThe commercial travelers are the spiders of enterprise, spinning and\r\nweaving without distaff or loom, swinging from town to town, from city\r\nto city, from continent to continent; and they are weaving the golden\r\nweb of commerce around the world, drawing the nations closer together in\r\nthe warp and woof of universal love and the universal brotherhood of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GATE IN THE GROUND.\r\n\r\n                           BY ROBERT LOVEMAN.\r\n\r\n           At the end of the lane of joy and pain,\r\n             We come to the little gate,\r\n           The king and the clown, and the court go down,\r\n             Through its portals soon or late;\r\n           The peasant, the peer, the sage and the seer,\r\n             Depart when the hour comes round,\r\n           With a kiss and a sigh, and a last good-bye,\r\n             Through the little lone gate in the ground.\r\n\r\n           ’Tis fixed by fate, we must pass through the gate,\r\n             The dear little gate in the ground,\r\n           At the end of our ways of nights and days,\r\n             It is marked by a grassy mound;\r\n           We bend o’er the bier, with a sob and a tear,\r\n             From the still lips comes no sound,—\r\n           We never can know, where God’s gardens grow,\r\n             ’Till we pass through the gate in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Lyrical and Satirical\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTED BY VERMOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE RURAL SHEET.\r\n\r\n   The rural paper is a peach without a single doubt,\r\n   It is patent on the inside, patent medicine without;\r\n   Yet it giveth information both select and wide of reach\r\n   From a card of thanks for kindness to a double column preach;\r\n   It tells about the infant at the home of Bill and wife,\r\n   And it gives a thrilling storiette replete with love and strife;\r\n   It says the roads are passable though slightly out of shape,\r\n   An obituary notice names survivors wearing crepe;\r\n   It has a bristling column full of legislative news,\r\n   And when you have the cold or croup it tells you what to use;\r\n   Its special news to farmers is both choice and up-to-date\r\n   And it recommends the tablets that will keep your liver straight;\r\n   It is warmly Democratic and agin the robber class,\r\n   And although it hates the railroads it will sometimes use a pass;\r\n   The editor’s a pungent cuss and calls a spade a spade,\r\n   And he takes subscriptions right along in any kind of trade;\r\n   The paper is a weekly, but be careful how you spell,\r\n   And “drop around to see us when you’ve anything to sell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               JIU-JITSU.\r\n\r\nIf newspaper stories relative to this strange and recently introduced\r\nJapanese science are to be credited, Munchausen is henceforth the\r\nstandard Sunday school literature and the Arabian Nights prosy\r\nhistorical narrative.\r\n\r\nA squad or so of New York policemen were recently compelled to rescue a\r\nBowery mob from extinction at the hands of a burly young Jap, weighing\r\nin the neighborhood of a hundred pounds, while an American, after a few\r\nlessons, has solved the long delayed problem of the domestication of the\r\nhind leg of a mule.\r\n\r\nThese things being true—and they are conclusively backed by\r\nadvertisements in magazines and insinuating approvals from the White\r\nHouse, whose occupant in chief now never uses more than one finger on\r\nthe most strenuous opponent,—how many presumably settled social\r\ninstitutions are longer secure? What, for instance, of the historic\r\ntraditions hovering around the revered institutions of mother-in-law and\r\ncook lady? And what of the cherished monthly anticipation of the\r\nhorrific bill collector, the eleemosynary insurance agent and the\r\nsad-faced representative of a worthy charity? Consider the epochal\r\niconoclasm involved in the passage of these time-honored social,\r\ndomestic and civic pests!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, reflect upon the counter possibilities of\r\nthe parties enumerated becoming wise to jiu-jitsu before you!\r\nAuthorities state that the initiated can strangle a victim as readily by\r\na gentle pressure about the waist as by a strangle hold about the throat\r\nand that the lower extremities may be hopelessly disarranged by a finger\r\ngently exerted midway the spine. With casual instruction _sub rosa_, a\r\nman’s wife might economically elect the tender and twining embrace as an\r\neffective substitute for the divorce court, or might at pleasure convert\r\nhim into a permanent invalid while affecting to innocently scratch his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThat biblical narrative which has disturbed the faith of many of the\r\ncredulously reverent, wherein the ant inquires insinuatingly of the\r\nelephant if he fully realizes the thoughtlessness of his disposition to\r\novercrowd or shove, in this sidelight of modern criticism, receives a\r\nluminous and comforting ray of explanation and reassurance.

The conservatives and respectables among us are called upon\r\nto sweep back the tide of delusion threatening our decent and\r\ntime-honored prerogative of making wills and having them broken for the\r\nbenefit of unknown collateral relatives, lawyers, chorus girls and other\r\ncommon law tenements.\r\n\r\nIt is no less incumbent upon us as Americans and plutocrats to thwart\r\nthe disposition of meddlesome and impertinent persons of questioning in\r\nprint the wisdom of the Almighty in constituting us trustees without\r\nbond for the great indigent and financial unwashed. Aside from the\r\nblasphemous character of such delusions, expressed misgivings do nobody\r\ngood and actually mislead the public into a complete misconception of\r\nthe profound contumely of riches.\r\n\r\nThose foolishly inclined to consider our lot a bed of roses, hyacinths\r\nand Lawson pinks, will please reflect upon the dread uncertainty of not\r\nknowing at what moment “one” may be precipitated overboard from a yacht\r\nor be hurled to a violent finish from the back of a vicious polo pony or\r\nperchance dislocate the spine on the palace stair or the inlaid floor,\r\nor superinduce apoplexy by overindulgence in golf or bridge! And reflect\r\nfor a moment upon the hazard of the auto from infants and common\r\npedestrians getting tangled in the machinery! And how about being\r\nwritten up in the putrid press and being called a congenital money maker\r\nwith pictures of some exceedingly primitive people called parents! And\r\nhow about being compelled to worry along without means to buy new hair,\r\nnew lungs and new stomachs? And how about irritating irregularities in\r\nthe water supply when the stock is famishing and how about the Sunday\r\nschool class coming in late after a peevish week in rebates?\r\n\r\nFellow plutocrats, aristocrats and autocrats, let us\r\nsteel—ourselves—yea, to callousness against the crime of being\r\nmisunderstood by the molten masses and betrayed from within by the\r\ntwo-faced Tom Lawson!\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HER SPECIALTY.\r\n\r\n  There’s a prejudice extensive ’gainst the Russian and his ways,\r\n  For the ruler or his people there is very little praise;\r\n  In the hurried march of progress they are badly out of date\r\n  (By the way, they’ve information on this subject just of late);\r\n  But with all their backward learning, yea, their sodden ignorance,\r\n  In one respect the Russians lead us all a merry dance\r\n  In a single branch of knowledge they can put us all to shame,\r\n  They can give us every face-card and then skin us at the game.\r\n  A high official undertakes a pleasant social drive\r\n  And it constitutes the last time he is ever seen alive;\r\n  In fact, the mere narration rather fills us with a dread,\r\n  For it is his last appearance, whether in the flesh or dead.\r\n  There’s a missile thrown, a loud report, and when the smoke is gone\r\n  There are not sufficient fragments left to pin a medal on;\r\n  There’s a gentle human drizzle, lasting frequently a day,\r\n  And they hold a tweedledeum o’er the dissipated spray.\r\n  To her style in execution as to neatness or dispatch,\r\n  There’s no other Christian nation that can hold a decent match.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HOW LONG?\r\n\r\nTo the patriotically inclined, the callousness of the public conscience\r\nto reforms freely demanded by the popular welfare is indeed alarming.\r\n\r\nConsider for example the supine indifference of the country at large\r\nover the ignominious defeat in Kansas of a great moral measure to enact\r\nthe ten commandments into law! And that it was accomplished in the teeth\r\nof a united support of a large, active and pious Methodist,\r\nCongregationalist and Presbyterian lobby!\r\n\r\nAnd who does not recall the humiliating failure of the Georgia patriot\r\nto have passed a bill to protect the long neglected interests of bull\r\nbats, turtles and other game birds hitherto and still entirely ignored\r\nby that presumably enlightened commonwealth?\r\n\r\nAnd while there was a low and sullen popular rumble in Tennessee against\r\na shameless lobby of centralized bachelors that by bribes, imprecations\r\nand cajoleries smothered a _pro bono publico_ measure to tax their\r\nimmunity from the strenuous life, public sentiment is once more callous\r\nand numb.\r\n\r\nAs a climax in corporate effrontery, however, as well as an extreme\r\nillustration of popular lethargy, a Missouri bill to prohibit the\r\ncriminal practice of tipping waiters in hotels, restaurants and cafés\r\nwas ingloriously snowed under and that, too, in the face of the\r\nlynx-eyed young governor. A cunning realization by the beef trust of the\r\nimpossibility of getting its unrighteous commodity before the eating\r\npublic with such a regulation in vogue, is no doubt responsible for this\r\ngrave popular misfortune.\r\n\r\nHence the inquiry, what of the times when the public continues\r\nindifferent and when those who alone have the courage to essay the\r\npeople’s relief from the thrall of mammon and general unrighteousness\r\nare to be derided as freaks or purchased, and nothing done about it!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A CUBAN SKETCH\r\n\r\n                          By Harvey H. Hannah.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Anita, my child, the Alcalde declared last night at the market place\r\nthat the Americans would come to-day. I want you to braid fresh flowers\r\nin your hair as your mother used to do, then take my hand, child, and\r\nlead me down by the Plaza de Jesus, close by the fountain, that we may\r\nawait the coming of our friends.”\r\n\r\n“But, father, my dress is all torn and ragged, and you are old and\r\nblind; they will not expect such as we are to welcome them. They are\r\nsoldiers, father, and I am afraid of soldiers since the Spanish guards\r\nbeat you down at the Palace gate when you asked for alms.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know, little one, they are soldiers, but they are American\r\nsoldiers, American volunteers who have come to liberate Cuba; then let\r\nus hurry, child, and reach the Plaza before it is crowded.”\r\n\r\nThe old man was a Cuban reconcentrado, lame and blind and homeless, the\r\nmiserable creature of Spanish cruelty. The child that led him was his\r\ngrandchild, whose father was killed at “Royal Blanco,” defending the\r\nCuban flag. She was a typical little creole beauty, with face as sweet\r\nas a poet’s dream, yet sorrow and poverty made her beauty pathetic.\r\nLeading the old blind man, she entered the crowded Plaza, and whispering\r\nto him, said: “Father, we are near the fountain, now, and your seat on\r\nthe stone bench is vacant.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Anita,” said the old man, making the sign of the cross, “I hear\r\nthe gurgling of the water which the blessed Virgin gives to us poor\r\npeople to drink; now let me sit down and we will wait. There seem to be\r\nmany people on the Plaza to-day and from their voices they must indeed\r\nbe happy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, father,” said the child, “I have never seen so many people\r\nsince General Wilder’s army was here; and all the ladies are dressed in\r\nwhite and carry wreaths of flowers on their arms; and so many, father,\r\nhave little flags in their hands. I’ve never seen such flags before;\r\nthey are striped with red and white, and one corner is blue like the\r\nsky, all full of silver stars. They are beautiful! and must mean\r\nsomething good for our poor Cuba.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Anita,” said the old man, as a strange light lit up his face,\r\n“it’s the flag of liberty, the American stars and stripes. Oh! that I\r\ncould only see them; but what is the cheering, child? What is the cause\r\nof the people’s huzzas? Are the soldiers coming?”\r\n\r\n“No, father, no,” said the little one; “but General Gomez is taking down\r\nthe yellow flag of Spain from the City Hall and putting up your liberty\r\nflag—the one of the stars and stripes—in its place.”\r\n\r\n“God be praised,” muttered the old man on the stone bench, feebly making\r\nthe sign of the Cross. He leaned back as if he had fallen asleep, but it\r\nwas a sleep from which no mortal could awake him. The old patriot’s\r\nheart had when he ceased to beat, with happiness, knew that his unhappy\r\nland was free.\r\n\r\nAnita, thinking that he had fallen asleep, tried to arouse him, and\r\ncried out to him, “Father, don’t go to sleep—don’t you hear the music?\r\nAnd listen to the people’s cheer! Let us join in their cry, ‘Viva los\r\nAmericanos!’ Oh, father, here they come! Look! look! all dressed in blue\r\nwith that beautiful flag waving over them. See the ladies throw their\r\nwreaths of flowers on the ground before them! Wake up, dear father;\r\nplease wake up. I will take the roses out of my hair and throw them,\r\ntoo.” And holding the hand of the old dead man on the rock bench at the\r\nfountain, little Anita threw her only rosebud to our Volunteers in Blue.\r\n\r\nOne soldier in the ranks saw the child and picked up the flower. It\r\nbrought to him memories of one back in Tennessee. The next day the city\r\nofficials reported the death and burial of an old pauper, with many\r\nothers, but the world never knew that the old man’s heart stopped\r\nbeating with happiness over his country’s freedom, and none inquired\r\nwhat had become of the dark-eyed child who held his hand. Anita was all\r\nalone in the street, but the Tennessean who picked up her rosebud\r\nwatched after her, and she soon became the pet of the American camp. New\r\ndresses, new shoes, new friends, made in her a great change, and she was\r\nsoon the idol of the boys in blue.\r\n\r\nBut again Anita stands at the fountain in the Plaza de Jesus all alone.\r\nThe Tennessee Volunteers have been ordered home, they have done\r\neverything in their power to leave the child comfortable and in tender\r\nhands, but she follows them to the Plaza. Tears fill the eyes of the\r\nboys as they tell her good-bye; the flowers seem to wither in her hair,\r\nthe smiles die on her lips, the old sorrow comes back in her eyes, her\r\nsoldier friends are gone, the liberty flag is gone; the old rock bench\r\nby the fountain is empty; she is all alone on the Plaza to-night—poor\r\nlittle Anita. How much like Anita is Cuba, and how much like Cuba is\r\nAnita.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WITHIN A VALLEY NARROW.\r\n\r\n                          BY INGRAM CROCKETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Within a valley narrow\r\n                     I heard the vireo sing,\r\n                   And many a white-crowned sparrow,\r\n                     In silvery whispering.\r\n\r\n                   The blue-eyed grass was gleaming\r\n                     Upon a bank of green,\r\n                   And drowsy winds were dreaming\r\n                     The tulip trees between.\r\n\r\n                   Above a pool unwrinkled,\r\n                     Their faces fair to see\r\n                   The sunlight o’er them sprinkled,\r\n                     Leaned purple fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\n                   And with a grace entrancing,\r\n                     Above the avens low,\r\n                   White butterflies were dancing\r\n                     In bright adagio.\r\n\r\n                   And while for them a cricket\r\n                     His silver strings did smite,\r\n                   From out a wild-grape thicket\r\n                     Was thrust a hand of white.\r\n\r\n                   And thro’ the leaves uplifted,\r\n                     I saw, a moment’s space,\r\n                   Where dogwood blossoms drifted—\r\n                     A dryad’s laughing face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             LEISURE HOURS\r\n\r\n          For Conference Between the Magazine and its Readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us be mutually helpful. In this, the initial number of BOB TAYLOR’S\r\nMAGAZINE, one of the dominant thoughts in our minds is that of friendly\r\nreciprocity. You would not have subscribed to this periodical, we take\r\nit, were you not friendly to it and to its editor.\r\n\r\nWe wish not merely to amuse you, but to help you; and we wish you to\r\nhelp us, that, through us, you may help your own people, your own state\r\nand section and the whole country. To this end we invite, for the use of\r\nthis department, communications on all subjects of unusual interest and\r\nimportance, such as:\r\n\r\nProse and poetry of sentiment, fact and fancy.\r\n\r\nForgotten or unpublished bits of history and tradition.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes of famous men and women, and of quaint and curious\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThe best short stories and tales you have heard or read, if unusual or\r\nunfamiliar.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for the special benefit of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE, how it may\r\nbe improved, what it should contain, what it should omit.\r\n\r\nWrite us these things that all may profit by something of transcendent\r\ninterest to each.\r\n\r\nAlso ask questions of interest and importance on any subject. If we can\r\nanswer them, we will do so; and if we can’t answer them, we will invite\r\nour readers to do so.\r\n\r\nAddress all such communications to Leisure Hours Department of BOB\r\nTAYLOR’S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nWhat a mine of hidden wealth there is in the unrecorded legends of the\r\nSouth and the Southwest! What tales of the cavaliers of the Old\r\nDominion, of the mountaineers, of those modern argonauts who braved in\r\nthe wilderness more and greater dangers than did the fabled followers of\r\nJason, and whose descendants are now enjoying the golden fleece which\r\neluded their grasp! What of Oglethorpe, and Boone and Crockett,\r\nWhitefield and Doak, Jackson and Sam Houston, Lafitte and Bowie and\r\nBurr; of Lost Island, Barrancas and the Everglades; of the Creoles and\r\nAcadians, and the thousand and one thrilling tales of the treacherous\r\nred man! All these, and more, offer to the present and the future story\r\nteller an inexhaustible supply of the purest ore for transmuting, fusing\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nAnd what gems of prose and poetry lie unnoticed in the literature of the\r\nSouth! While other sections have given wide and constant publicity to\r\ntheir writers and their writers’ productions (and it was their duty to\r\ndo so), the poets and the masters of prose of the South of former days\r\nlie in forgotten graves and the dust of the library gathers thick upon\r\ntheir unopened volumes.\r\n\r\nWhat does the present generation know of Timrod, the “sweetest singer of\r\nAmerica?” What of Sims, pronounced by Poe to be the greatest writer of\r\nromantic fiction since the time of Cooper? These are but two out of the\r\ngalaxy of unnumbered stars in the Southern firmament, and they are\r\nmentioned merely to give point to the fact that suitable homage is not\r\nbeing rendered to the lights of other days.\r\n\r\nFor many years has Governor Taylor desired to establish a magazine that\r\nshould be not only a medium by which to reach an audience as widespread\r\nas the country itself, but which should also be a vehicle of Southern\r\nexpression, for the exploitation and advancement of Southern literature,\r\nfor the preservation of old time Southern ideals, and for the\r\ndissemination of knowledge concerning the material resources and\r\nadvantages of this section of our country—this primarily. And,\r\nsecondarily, to breathe abroad a catholic spirit of patriotism,\r\nuncramped by a scintilla of sectionalism (opprobriously so termed), of\r\nenvy, or of ill will to any one; but to carry to every home and to each\r\nindividual therein personally a message of peace, of harmony and of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nBOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE, like its editor, stands for the South and for the\r\nsunshine that smiles on its beauty and ripens the fruit of its rich and\r\nfertile soil. Every fair and precious possession of this section will\r\nfind representation and appreciation in these pages, and every uplift of\r\npurpose, every outspreading of energy now working toward the development\r\nof the South will receive the encouragement of this publication.\r\n\r\nWhat the past holds in precious memory, great achievement and pure\r\nideals shall be cherished and held. But in a special sense BOB TAYLOR’S\r\nMAGAZINE is working in the present and for the future. The record of the\r\nlast decade in the South has become the wonder of the industrial and\r\ncommercial world, but if the spiritual and intellectual development does\r\nnot keep pace with this material growth, the figures which record our\r\nwealth and prosperity will be but the handwriting on the wall, warning\r\nus of downfall and ruin.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, the purpose of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE to offer each\r\nmonth, stories, poems and articles mined from the rich vein of Southern\r\nsentiment and of Southern life; and these riches will be offered to an\r\naudience as numerous and appreciative as any to which a Southern writer\r\ncan appeal.\r\n\r\nA momentous change impends in the citizenship of the South, perhaps in\r\ncharacter, certainly in number. For the South is vibrant with energy,\r\nits commercial interests have never before throbbed with such activity;\r\nand never before has the need of intelligent labor been quite so urgent.\r\nThe negro, indeed, is here, and for certain kinds of work is the best\r\ntoiler in the world, if he be properly handled. For field labor, for\r\nforest work, for outdoor rough work of every description, for numerous\r\nkinds of inside work and for porterage and drayage, he is unequalled,\r\nprovided he be not given authority over others, or an official position\r\nof any kind. In such event he becomes spoiled, foolish and useless.\r\n\r\nTo skilled labor in factories and mills the negro is not adapted, as a\r\nrule, and is inefficient; and the manufacturing industries of the South\r\nare growing apace. Extraordinary efforts are, therefore, being made to\r\ndivert to the states south of Mason and Dixon’s line a part of the\r\nenormous flood of immigrants which for many years has been directed\r\ntoward the West and the Northwest.\r\n\r\nAnd these aliens are coming South in ever increasing streams. Railroads\r\ntransport them; land agents urge them; commercial organizations invite\r\nthem, and farms and factories employ them—and what will be the result?\r\nLet us see!\r\n\r\nUntil this horde of foreigners began to debouch upon the fertile soil of\r\nDixie, this section possessed the purest Anglo-Saxon blood, not only in\r\nAmerica, but in the world. In the area south of the Ohio and east of the\r\nMississippi, there were, and still are, fewer foreign-born inhabitants\r\nthan are found in the single state of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nHow will the South be affected by the new trend? Can it preserve its old\r\nideals and the purity of its blood, while utilizing the new elements in\r\nthe building up of its material welfare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           BOOKS AND AUTHORS\r\n\r\n                  CONDUCTED BY GENELLA FITZGERALD NYE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CLANSMAN: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan. By Thomas\r\n    Dixon, Jr. Doubleday, Page & Co., New York. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\n  BETHANY: A Story of the Old South. By Thomas E. Watson. D. Appleton &\r\n    Co., New York. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nIn considering these two books, it is impossible to avoid comparing and\r\ncontrasting them with each other. Both aim at historical study as well\r\nas romantic presentation, and both are conceived from the Southerner’s\r\nview-point of the great Civil War. Both writers are famous platform\r\nfigures, and neither, it may be conceded, is equipped by taste,\r\ntemperament, or training, for purely literary work. Both Mr. Dixon and\r\nMr. Watson have interests more absorbing than the production of artistic\r\nfiction, and the novels of neither can fairly be judged by the higher\r\ncritical standards. One feels in reading the fiction of Mr. Dixon and\r\nMr. Watson that it is but the vehicle of a purpose other than literary,\r\nand furthermore, that that purpose must be the presentation of truth.\r\nAnd here it is that the gap between the two authors begins to widen, for\r\nMr. Dixon’s self-conscious rhetoric and platform appeal give the lie\r\neven to unimpeachable history, while Mr. Watson’s narration has the very\r\naccent of truth in its homely simplicity and utter absence of pose.\r\n\r\n“The Clansman” opens upon the political ferment at Washington just\r\nbefore Lincoln’s assassination, and Lincoln, Stanton, Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nand other prominent men of that period are depicted in somewhat daring\r\ndetail of characterization and narration. With the revolution of the\r\nnational policy which followed Lincoln’s death, the scene is shifted to\r\nSouth Carolina, where the horrors of reconstruction and the heroic work\r\nof the Ku Klux Klan are painted in Mr. Dixon’s most highly colored\r\nrhetoric. We have no disposition to belittle the tragedy of that period\r\nin the South, and there is no doubt that the secret organization known\r\nas the Ku Klux Klan did save the Southern people from much indignity and\r\ndegradation, but the manner of Mr. Dixon’s narration has not the dignity\r\nof truth, and, however true his individual instances may be, the effect\r\nof the story is not that of truth. The note of heroic determination and\r\nimpressive mystery which dignified the mummery of the Ku Klux Klan into\r\na power to save Southern civilization and protect Southern womanhood,\r\nMr. Dixon misses entirely, and his treatment, like a tawdry bit of\r\ngilding, vulgarizes what it touches.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dixon, in literature, has repeated his successes of the pulpit and\r\nplatform,” his publishers’ note informs us, and it is so far true that\r\nhe has repeated in his novels the methods of his platform and pulpit\r\nsuccesses. But save in the commercial sense, it cannot be said that Mr.\r\nDixon’s work in fiction is a success, and it stands justified only by a\r\nprevailing bad taste and his own and his publishers’ pocket-book.\r\n\r\n“A Story of the Old South”—we may be pardoned for a slightly tired\r\nfeeling on reading those words on the title page of “Bethany,” but the\r\nfirst chapter is reassuring in its sturdy presentation of middle class\r\nGeorgia life, simple, unpretentious, plain, and absolutely uncolored\r\nwith the grandeur, so familiar in “befo’ the wah” fiction. It is\r\nrefreshing to read such passages as these:\r\n\r\n“We Hortons were a family of middle class farmers. We had never been\r\nanything else. We never expected to be anything else. Our condition was\r\ngood enough for us. We had plenty of land. We had always had it.... Yes;\r\nwe had prospered; and had always been independent. We were not rich, you\r\nunderstand: just comfortable; with good farms, fat stock, and likely\r\nniggers We owed no debts; we had a few hundred of dollars in pocket,\r\nready for an emergency—such as a request for a loan to some friend who\r\nmight have got into a temporary ‘tight’ by betting on the wrong horse,\r\nor by trying to make four queens beat a straight flush....\r\n\r\n“So far as we came into touch with the outside world at all, we were\r\nindebted to Bethany—a little, one-horse hamlet, where we worshiped and\r\ngot the mail. Bethany had a granite depot on the Georgia railroad.\r\nBethany had a post office. Bethany had a dry-goods store and two\r\ndoggeries. Anyone who wished to run a horse race, fight chickens, play\r\npoker, or throw ‘chuck-a-luck,’ could do so at Bethany.\r\n\r\n“The mansion in which we lived was a very modest affair. It did not, in\r\nthe least, resemble a Grecian temple which had been sent into exile and\r\nwhich was striving, unsuccessfully, to look at ease among corn-cribs,\r\ncow-pens, horse-stables, pig-sties, chicken-houses, negro cabins, and\r\nworm-fenced cotton fields. It did not perch upon the top of the highest\r\nhill for miles around, and browbeat the whole community with its\r\narrogant self-assertion. No; ours was just a plain house and none too\r\nlarge, not built out of bricks brought over from England, but of timbers\r\ntorn from the heart of the long-leaf Georgia pine.”\r\n\r\nIn this vein Mr. Watson proceeds to give a picture of the plain Georgian\r\nand his environment, which has all the charm of personal reminiscence\r\nand the weight of historic truth. One feels in reading these simple\r\nannals of the Hortons of Georgia that just so they must have lived and\r\nnot otherwise, and the last paragraph of the first chapter describes for\r\nus the effect of Mr. Watson’s portrayal:\r\n\r\n“It all rises before me complete as a picture, vivid as a flash of\r\nlightning—a plain, unpretentious, comfortable, happy Southern home of\r\nthe old regime—and like a castle among the clouds it is gone forever,\r\neven while I gaze; just as the republic of our fathers, of which that\r\nold home was a typical part, is gone, forever gone.”\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, perhaps, this sturdy middle class exercised a more potent\r\nand pervading influence over social and political life than was the case\r\nin other Southern states, and its flavor and quality are reproduced to\r\nthe life by Mr. Watson. As we read his record we see what was perhaps\r\nthe most practical realization of the democratic ideal of society which\r\nthis democracy has yet produced—a community of Anglo-Saxon blood, rugged\r\nmanhood, gentle womanhood, simple habits and neighborly fraternity. Mr.\r\nWatson gives us the picture of this period with no reservation or\r\nexaggeration,—its beauties and its blots, its virtues and its vices, its\r\ndevelopment and its limitation, and throughout his work there is a rare\r\nmingling of impartial honesty and the sympathetic touch of close and\r\nintimate knowledge and association.\r\n\r\nThe political agitation of the two years previous to the war in Georgia\r\nis reproduced carefully and effectively by Mr. Watson, and the Toombs\r\nand Stephens struggle set forth clearly and skilfully. The pen portraits\r\nof these great Georgians are sharply and strongly outlined, and may be\r\nregarded as of historic interest and importance. A spicy and forcible\r\nchapter is that describing a political barbecue at Bethany at which\r\nToombs and Stephens spoke, and of which the festivities were further\r\nmarked by an eye-gouging affair between two drunken patriots. We see in\r\nMr. Watson’s narrative the various currents of Southern sentiment and\r\ntheir irresistible convergence into the tide of secession, and the\r\nSouthern attitude is strongly justified as a logical result of the\r\nNorthern breach of contract in refusing to obey the Fugitive Slave laws.\r\n“As to the right of secession,” says Mr. Watson, “no one denied it....\r\nWith Adams, Webster, and Calhoun harmonized in favor of secession, it\r\ndid seem that the principle must be sound.”\r\n\r\nThe second part of Mr. Watson’s book, and not the more interesting,\r\ntreats of the war and a rather shadowy love affair, pitched in the key\r\nof the sentimental songs of that period, with their faded flowers,\r\nmocking-birds, and pathetic partings. The story of the war is told\r\nbriefly, with no prejudice or passion, from the gallant days of hope and\r\nvictory to the last sad struggle against the inevitable. There is no\r\nswagger of tone, no attempt at glamour in these war pictures, but a\r\nfaithful and forcible presentation of what that time meant to the common\r\nsoldier and the South. Indeed, the whole book has a historic value as a\r\ntruthful study of an interesting period of Southern and national life,\r\nand with no pretense of literary art, it has a distinct charm of simple\r\nnarration and vivid reminiscence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE LAW OF THE LAND. By EMERSON HOUGH, Author of “The Mississippi\r\n    Bubble,” etc. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of excitement in Mr. Hough’s latest novel—intrigue,\r\nmystery, villainy, a negro uprising, a Mississippi overflow—these\r\nsucceed each other rapidly and bewilderingly, and there is “something\r\ndoing” in every chapter. The scene is the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta,—“the\r\nrichest region on the face of the whole earth,” “the heart of the only\r\nAmerican part of America”—and the race question in its intensest and\r\nmost picturesque form is the theme of the book. From a dramatic and\r\nartistic standpoint, the theme and the setting are well chosen, and in\r\nthe description of the negro gathering in the forest at the call of the\r\nsavage drum and the half-hinted horrors of the revenge of the whites,\r\nthere is the unmistakable thrill of literary power and skill.\r\n\r\nThe conventional hero is a railroad claim agent, rather an original role\r\nfor a Southern hero of romance, and a thoroughly good fellow he is, but\r\nthe masterpiece of characterization is that of Colonel Calvin Blount of\r\nthe Big House,—rough, brave, chivalrous, lordly, ruling over his wide\r\nacres with the imperious will and open-handed generosity of a feudal\r\nbaron. His trial for murder in a lynching case is the culminating point\r\nof the book, and Eddring’s speech in his defense presents the author’s\r\nsolution of the race problem in the South. “The law of the land” must be\r\ntransgressed sometimes in the letter that it may be kept in the spirit,\r\nand Colonel Blount is acquitted of the murder which he committed in view\r\nof the horrors which negro rule would bring to Southern civilization.\r\nThere is nothing new or profound in Mr. Hough’s treatment of the race\r\nproblem, but in presenting it as it exists in the lower South in its\r\nmost extreme form, he has availed himself of excellent material for\r\ndramatic romance. To the average American the life to which Mr. Hough\r\nintroduces us in “The Law of the Land” will seem as strange and foreign\r\nas a glimpse into the jungles of Africa, but it is real, if exceptional,\r\nand Mr. Hough’s vivid picture may disturb the academic theories of New\r\nEngland to some extent. Had the author spared us the treatise on the\r\nrace problem as embodied in Eddring’s defense of Colonel Blount, the\r\nnovel would have been lightened by so much dead weight of argument and\r\nrhetoric. As it is, “The Law of the Land,” leaving out the tinselly plot\r\non which the heroine’s identity and fortune depend, is a good story of\r\ndramatic power, picturesque description, and strong characterization.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MASTER-WORD. A Story of the South To-day. By L. H. HAMMOND. The\r\n    Macmillan Company, New York. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis, the first novel, of a Southern woman, bears no mark of immaturity,\r\nfeminine weakness, or sectional prejudice. The style is notably compact\r\nand finished, the handling strong and restrained, and the grasp of\r\nphilosophic breadth and impartiality. Mrs. Hammond is something more\r\nthan the clever woman who, in such numbers, is pervading the literature\r\nof the day—she is clearly a woman who can think closely and deeply, and\r\nher literary work has a real solidity of substance and significance. She\r\nhas given us in “The Master-Word” a strong and original story, direct\r\nfrom her own thought, experience and observation, though it does not\r\nprove always humanly convincing or artistically satisfactory.\r\n\r\n“The Master-Word” is a problem novel in a double sense, for though the\r\nrace question is the theme with which it is chiefly concerned, the sex\r\nquestion figures also in a subordinate way. Both problems are solved by\r\nthe writer with the master-word, Love, not Law—Love that suffers,\r\nsacrifices, and conquers, not Law that judges, condemns and punishes.\r\nThis idea is wrought out with psychical insight and vigorous reasoning,\r\nand as a thesis is eminently satisfactory, but the story which is the\r\nmedium of its illustration does not always ring true, and moreover is\r\nweakest at the crucial points.\r\n\r\nMargaret, the young wife of Philip Lawton, a prosperous and aristocratic\r\nlawyer and farmer of Tennessee, discovers suddenly the fact of her\r\nhusband’s criminal relations with a mulatto woman and his fatherhood of\r\nthe latter’s child, a girl about the age of Margaret’s own daughter. She\r\nrefuses to forgive and their estranged relations continue till he is\r\nstricken with pneumonia. At his deathbed the love she thought dead\r\nrevives, and she forgives, as she realizes that the master-word is Love,\r\nnot Law. This scene, by the way, is strongly reminiscent of the\r\nconcluding chapter of “The Mettle of the Pasture,” where the dying\r\nhusband delivers himself of his stagy and unnatural monologue.\r\n\r\nAfter Philip’s death, Margaret, as a sort of reparation in Philip’s\r\nname, conceives the idea of taking his illegitimate negro child,\r\ndeserted by its mother, under her protection and care, so the little\r\nquadroon girl is brought to the Lawton home and placed in charge of Aunt\r\nDilsey, the old mammy, who proclaims it her grandchild. There Viry is\r\nreared, playing with the Lawton children, sharing much of their life,\r\nbut recognized as a “nigger” and treated on that basis. She is sent, as\r\nshe grows older, to a negro college, where she learns rapidly, and\r\nfinally comes back to the Lawtons and Aunt Dilsey, dissatisfied and\r\nembittered, frankly hating the race with which she is classed, but\r\nattached by the strongest affection to Bess Lawton, her half-sister. She\r\nbecomes a teacher in a negro school, but holds herself aloof from the\r\nnegroes, and grows more bitter and desperate. Bruce Carleton, the lover\r\nof Bess, is the object of her secret passion, and the savage, bestial\r\nstrain in her make-up comes out in her plan to attract him and hold him\r\nin what to him would be a purely sensual tie. Finding out that Bess\r\nreally loves him, however, she renounces her purpose, and, hopeless of\r\nhappiness, tries to commit suicide. Then comes the culminating point of\r\nthe book in the disclosure to Viry by Margaret of the secret of the\r\nformer’s birth. Margaret lays bare her own suffering and her husband’s\r\nsin and makes a powerful appeal to the girl to accept her maimed and\r\nburdened life and make it in some measure an atonement and a redemption.\r\nViry’s heart is reached at last, and she, too, bows to the master-word,\r\nLove, which means for her a life of service and loneliness. The race\r\nline must not be obliterated—this is made plain, and Mrs. Hammond’s\r\nargument is notably strong and unhackneyed. Margaret’s reply to Viry,\r\nwhen the latter, “the red blood burning in her face,” throws up to her\r\nthe existence of three million mulattos as a proof that instinct is not\r\nagainst the union of black and white, is the most convincing and\r\ncomplete answer to that plea that has yet been presented.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us unfortunate that Mrs. Hammond should have chosen to base\r\nher story on an incident at once so repulsive and so untrue as that of\r\nPhilip Lawton’s criminal connection with the degraded mulatto. For,\r\nunder the conditions described and set forth by the author, the case of\r\nPhilip is so absolutely untypical and strikingly exceptional that its\r\nuse as the foundation stone of so serious a story seems an amazing\r\nblunder of judgment, taste and ethics. Then, again, it is hardly\r\nconceivable that a woman of Margaret’s training and temperament, would\r\nhave found her duty in bringing her husband’s negro child into her own\r\nhousehold in constant contact with herself and her children. The step\r\nseems forced and unnatural in the highest degree, and no less so appears\r\nthe wife’s disclosure of her husband’s shame after so many years to the\r\nquadroon girl. Nature, womanhood, taste, all revolt against such a\r\nsituation. Reality is sacrificed to theory, and Margaret becomes the\r\nauthor’s creature, not her creation; her spokesman, not a natural woman.\r\nViry, too, is not quite genuine to our perceptions, and can certainly\r\nnot be regarded as a typical product of her blood and environment. At\r\nbest her story is an extreme case, put in its most extreme terms.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate region of Middle Tennessee is the scene of the story, and\r\nits peculiar conditions of labor and the twists and turns of local\r\npolitics are presented with a keen and trenchant touch. The young people\r\nof the book are an extremely natural and agreeable set, and the love\r\naffair of Bess and Bruce is as fresh and wholesome as the fine country\r\nair that pervades the book. Bruce is really a wonder for a woman’s hero,\r\nbeing neither cad nor prig, but merely a straight and likable young\r\nfellow with human faults and failings. Aunt Dilsey is at once a\r\nphotograph, a phonograph, and a sympathetic sketch of the old-time negro\r\nmammy.\r\n\r\nThere is a looseness of construction, a prolixity of trifling incident,\r\nat certain portions of the book which at times weaken its interest, and\r\nit is evident that purely artistic ideals were not its chief\r\ninspiration. Still, when all is said, its merits far outweigh its\r\nfaults, and it is well worth the serious criticism it will receive. It\r\ntestifies strongly to the writer’s brain and skill and arouses interest\r\nin her future work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SECRET WOMAN. By EDEN PHILLPOTTS. The Macmillan Company, New York.\r\n    Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThe comparison to Hardy has become a commonplace of any criticism of Mr.\r\nPhillpotts’ literary output, and the comparison carries an inevitable\r\ndistinction and disparagement. The distinction is that Mr. Phillpotts is\r\nthe one writer worthy to be called a disciple of the Wessex chronicler,\r\nand the disparagement is in the differentiation at once apparent in the\r\nsimilarity. Primitive nature, physical and human, is Mr. Phillpotts’\r\ntheme as it is Mr. Hardy’s, and the primal passions in rustic life are\r\nthe elements of both novelists’ tragedy and comedy. But though one man\r\nmay want and try to make from the same material the same things as\r\nwrought by another, it is out of his power to do so, and Mr. Phillpotts’\r\nwork lacks the strength and seriousness of Mr. Hardy’s. In the first\r\nplace, the colorless irony of the older writer, epitomized so perfectly\r\nin his title, “Far from the Madding Crowd,” is lacking entirely in Mr.\r\nPhillpotts, and the latter’s florid descriptions and psychologic\r\nanalyses fail of the Hardy effect because of this lack. The personal\r\nnote of Mr. Hardy, ironic, accentless, incisive, is the salt to his\r\nmagnificent dish of natural elements, without which their strength and\r\nfreshness would pall upon the taste. And as a literary artist, too, Mr.\r\nPhillpotts falls below his master. Despite the wealth of natural\r\ndescription with which he burdens so heavily his narratives, there is\r\nnothing that touches the Hardy landscapes in power and artistic truth.\r\nThe wonderful and haunting picture of the moor in “The Return of the\r\nNative” is Hardy at highwater mark, it is true, but there is nothing in\r\nthe Phillpotts gallery that can even be compared to it.\r\n\r\n“The Secret Woman” is a story of human frailty, passion, crime, and soul\r\nstruggle, set in the rocks and glades of Dartmoor. An illicit love\r\nbetween a married man and a beautiful and pagan-hearted girl is the\r\nbasis of the plot, and the murder of the man by his wife in a fit of\r\njealous rage is the first act of the tragedy. A touch worthy of Hardy\r\noccurs in the interview between husband and wife just after the latter’s\r\ndiscovery of the man’s unfaithfulness, when a sudden gust of wind and\r\nrain drowns the wife’s voice as she offers pardon, thus through the blow\r\nof blind fate sealing the husband’s doom. The murder is witnessed by the\r\ntwo sons, but is kept secret, though it divides the brothers and fills\r\nthe mother’s life with a never-dying repentance. The figure of the\r\nmurderess, Anne Redvers, and the study of her character and soul\r\ndevelopment, are the most elaborate and striking work of the book, but\r\nit is Salome, “the secret woman,” and her intrigue with the dead man,\r\nunknown and unsuspected, that furnish the motive for the drama. In\r\nstriking contrast are the two women, one dark, stern, conscientious,\r\nsoftening and mellowing through sorrow and repentance into sympathy and\r\nforgiveness, the other fair, conscienceless, self-indulgent, swayed but\r\nby emotion and passion.\r\n\r\nJesse, one of the sons of the murdered man, loves this girl, his\r\nfather’s paramour, and she becomes his betrothed, driven to this step by\r\npoverty, though she never intends to marry him. This intolerable\r\nsituation is finally ended by his confession to Salome of his mother’s\r\ncrime which has darkened his soul, and this is followed by Salome’s\r\nreckless disclosure of her love and sin to Anne Redvers, whom she\r\ndenounces as a murderess. Anne goes to prison gladly, Jesse kills\r\nhimself, and Salome lives on, constant to her dead lover and incapable\r\nof repentance. Truly Mr. Phillpotts has not spared us a possible horror.\r\n\r\nWe have, of course, the rustic comedy beneath the tragedy—the artless\r\npeasants, their quaint talk and ancient superstitions; and the figure of\r\nJoseph Westaway, the shiftless, tender-hearted incompetent, bravely and\r\nunreasonably optimistic amid crowding misfortunes, is very nearly a\r\nmasterpiece of portraiture.\r\n\r\nIn this terrible drama, Mr. Phillpotts offers us in succession the\r\nvarious theories of materialism, Old Testament theology, pagan\r\nindifference, and simple, unquestioning faith in a divine power. Each is\r\npresented with admirable impartiality, its play upon the story being\r\nmerely an aid to the desired dramatic effect. At the last, the struggle\r\nis between Anne and Salome, and the former who has found peace in\r\nChristian faith and atonement, makes her appeal to Salome to seek\r\ncomfort and salvation by the same road. Finally Salome promises to take\r\nthe sacrament, but as she kneels at the sacred table, her heart is\r\nunchanged—\r\n\r\n“A man’s voice suddenly ended the silence and—echoes from a far past—his\r\nwords fell upon her ear strangely. All solemnity has perished from them.\r\nThe Commandments tinkled like a child’s little prayer at bedtime....\r\nLight rained down and quenched the candles and touched the petals of\r\nexotic flowers. The air of the sanctuary was sweet with them; but\r\nSalome’s thoughts harboured in the dust.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMERICA, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC. By WOLF VON SCHIERBRAND, PH.D. Henry\r\n    Holt & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the ancient and of the mediæval world centered around\r\nthe Mediterranean. Recall the names of the states that fought for and\r\nobtained the trade of that sea and you have the history of civilization.\r\nEgypt, Phœnicia, Greece, Carthage, Rome, Venice, Spain, one after\r\nanother, played the leading role. With the discovery of the new world\r\nthe scene shifted to the Atlantic and England shouldered her way to the\r\nlimelight. Now, it seems, another new world and a richer has been\r\ndiscovered. It happens also to be the oldest world and the last act of\r\nthe drama is to be played on the Pacific, the widest stage of all.\r\nBefore the whole world as audience, the nations are contending for the\r\nprize—the trade of China. Which one is to get it?\r\n\r\nMr. von Schierbrand contributes to the solution of this question a very\r\nentertaining and instructive volume. From his standpoint, which is a\r\nmost interesting one, the importance of the trade of the Far East to\r\nourselves is not to be overestimated. The wonderful productive energy of\r\nthe United States makes the need of new markets imperative. Four hundred\r\nmillions of Chinese can furnish us such markets. Basing our figures on\r\nthe precedent of Japan, China, if she would, could buy of the world\r\n$35,000,000,000 more. Her mineral wealth, still undeveloped, is greater\r\nthan that of North America.\r\n\r\nThe author’s masterly marshaling of the means and the methods necessary\r\nto increase our commercial opportunities is the feature of his book. The\r\npolitical school to which he belongs and to which an immense majority of\r\nAmericans belong, if the recent election meant anything, studies, at the\r\nsame moment, the tonnage of the battleships and the quality of the\r\ncotton blouse on the Chinese coolie’s back. It carries us around the\r\nimmense circle of the Pacific and calls the roll of the powers and\r\nprincipalities of the future—Canada, America, Java, Sumatra, Celebes,\r\nBorneo, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, China, Siberia,—and asks\r\nwhich of the nations shall share with us these riches. England’s claim\r\nthe writer dismisses with few words. England is conservative and\r\ndecadent. Russia is more dangerous. She aims to absorb all Asia and\r\nclose the door in the face of the world. The writer has an interesting\r\ndiscussion of the Russo-Japanese war in the course of which he prods the\r\nEnglish again for not choking the Russians while they can.\r\n\r\nGermany he pronounces our most formidable rival. German industry,\r\nfrugality, patience and skill have brought her up since 1870, when she\r\nwas purely an agricultural state, to the front rank in manufactures and\r\nin foreign trade. It may be added, parenthetically, that she is making\r\npersistent efforts to free herself from the American cotton monopoly.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Japanese, the writer mentions a fact whose significance\r\nis little appreciated in America. Japan practically monopolizes now the\r\ntrade in manufactured cotton with China, and, what is still more\r\nsignificant, she gets nearly all her raw cotton from India.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret purpose of Japan? Nobody knows. Does she see herself\r\nsupplanting the wornout Manchu dynasty and leading the millions of the\r\nEast to the mastery of Asia by the strength of her military genius? Will\r\nshe then shut the doors to the outside world, as, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, she shut her own? The writer makes light of the so-called\r\nYellow Peril, arguing that Japan does not wish to exploit the latent\r\nmilitary strength of China, but aspires to lead her in the path of\r\nindustrial progress after the Western models upon which Japan has\r\nfashioned herself.\r\n\r\nMr von Schierbrand ignores the underlying spiritual differences that\r\nseparate the Oriental from the European, differences that will always be\r\nthe cause of hostility, open or veiled, between them. After all it is\r\nnot so important who is to get the trade of the East but what are the\r\nideals that are finally to prevail there—the Christian ideals or\r\nOriental fatalism. It could be wished that the author felt more interest\r\nin such discussions. One is tempted to quote against him his own words\r\nin another connection: “Beside the mad passion for gain there is no\r\ncharm in rest, lettered ease, travel, still less in labor for the\r\ngeneral good—charity, education, the state; the ruling passion must rage\r\non, business must be expanded regardless of profit and with eyes closed\r\nto impending loss. Instead of making ourselves more homes and more\r\nbeautiful things and cultured people in them, we cherish the tenement\r\nhouse and the narrow life, and go on piling up and shoving out what we\r\nare pleased to call goods, goods, goods.” It is well enough to chasten\r\nourselves with such reflections as we go on with the author to weigh the\r\nclaim of the United States to the lion’s share in the trade of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe author bases our claim on the strategic advantage which the Panama\r\nCanal is to give us, and this part of the book is unquestionably most\r\ninteresting to the South. The relation of the richest granary in the\r\nworld, the Mississippi Valley, to the Canal will rid it of the need of\r\nrailways. The canal will bring New York closer to the west coast of\r\nSouth America than San Francisco, and New Orleans will be seven hundred\r\nmiles nearer still. The commercial availability of Southern coal and\r\niron will be immensely increased and the harbors of the South will\r\nassume an importance long withheld from them as ports of call.\r\n\r\nThe book as a whole is well written, and the last chapters, which\r\nsummarize the author’s conclusions, especially so. What he has to say\r\nabout public opinion and of the force, more universal still, the primary\r\nneed of the human race of food, which together share the sovereignty of\r\nthe modern world, is well said and more philosophical by far than is\r\nusual with the books of the imperialists.\r\n\r\n                                                                      L.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE COLOR LINE. By WILLIAM BENJAMIN SMITH. McClure, Phillips and Co.,\r\n    New York.\r\n\r\nIt is always a satisfaction when what has been dumbly felt is put at\r\nlast into a clear-cut scientific concept. This is what William Benjamin\r\nSmith has done for us with his book on the negro problem. The South has\r\nalways felt that the problem was not one involving philanthropy or the\r\nrights of man or any sort of altruism. Those are considerations that\r\nhave to do with individuals. The negro problem is purely a question of\r\nrace. As Mr. Bagehot pointed out in his clever book, “Physics and\r\nPolitics,” the differences existing to-day between the Aryan races and\r\nthe negro are greater than any causes now acting are capable of creating\r\nin present-day men. The laws of heredity are not fully known, but it is\r\ncertain that the descendants of cultivated parents have an inborn\r\naptitude for civilization due to the structure of their nervous systems.\r\nThe uncivilized races do not improve; they have not the basis on which\r\nto build, but instead have inherited natures twisted into a thousand\r\ncurious habits, a thousand strange prejudices and a thousand grotesque\r\nsuperstitions. The moment it is admitted that the difference between\r\nwhite and black is the product of evolution the hope of bridging the\r\ndifference by education is gone. That it must be admitted is the thesis\r\nof Mr. Smith’s book, which ought to be read by every man and woman in\r\nthe country who is open to reason. Once admitted, the conclusion follows\r\nswiftly and irresistibly. The duty of the white man to maintain in its\r\npurity the germ plasm of the white race justifies the denial of social\r\nequality to the black man. This is a duty which no sentimentality can\r\nexcuse for it is a duty to civilization, to posterity, to the country.\r\nNeglect it, and mongrelization follows inevitably. We quote from the\r\nbook: “It is this immediate jewel of her soul that the South watches\r\nwith such a dragon eye, that she guards with more than vestal vigilance,\r\nwith a circle of perpetual fire. The blood thereof is the life thereof;\r\nhe who would defile it would stab her in her heart of hearts, and she\r\nsprings to repulse him with the fiercest instinct of self-preservation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smith has brought to his argument a wealth of learning and research\r\nwhich places his book in the rank of an authority on a much\r\nmisunderstood question.\r\n\r\n                                                                      L.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE PURSUIT OF PHYLLIS. By JOHN HARWORD BACON. Henry Holt, New York.\r\n    Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nTom Mott, a clever literateur of New York, is ordered to take a rest by\r\nhis physician, and goes abroad to seek recreation and relaxation. At his\r\nLondon hotel, he finds in his dresser drawer some letters addressed to\r\nMiss Phyllis Huntingdon in the handwriting of an old chum, and impelled\r\nby a Quixotic impulse, he determines to restore them to their owner in\r\nperson. From London he proceeds to Paris, thence to Marseilles, through\r\nthe Mediterranean to Port Said and the Orient, very much in the style of\r\nan up-to-date Gabriel and Evangeline affair, always finding at each port\r\nthat Miss Huntingdon’s departure had antedated his arrival by a few\r\nhours. Finally his quest is rewarded at Colombo on the island of Ceylon,\r\nwhere he meets Phyllis, a ruddy-haired, winsome young woman, who is\r\nlikened successively by the imaginative Mr. Mott to a dish of pink ice\r\ncream, a rosy-tipped peony, and the summer girl on a magazine cover.\r\nThey come back together across the world, ending the trip, after the\r\nexcitement of a misunderstanding and a quarrel, in orthodox fashion. A\r\nlively trifle of globe-trotting and philandering is “The Pursuit of\r\nPhyllis,” easy to read, and disarming criticism by its utter lack of\r\nseriousness and significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DAPHNE AND HER LAD. By M. J. LAGEN and CALLY RYLAND. Henry Holt, New\r\n    York. Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nA story told in letters—the brilliant and showy correspondence so much\r\naffected in fiction and so rarely indulged in in real life. The writers,\r\ntoo, are newspaper folk, a man and a woman, each editor of a woman’s\r\npage, and we mildly wonder how they ever found time to sacrifice so much\r\ngood “copy” to private correspondence. At first, the exchange of letters\r\nis but a journalistic flirtation between two unknown personalities, and\r\nit is maintained and continued to the point of intimate self-revelation\r\nand ardent lovemaking before the writers meet in the last chapter. The\r\ndisclosure and denouement of the conclusion come with somewhat of a\r\nshock to the unsuspecting reader who has followed the airy persiflage\r\nand sentimental outpourings of these industrious letter writers with no\r\nthought of such a tragic ending as that on which the curtain falls. It\r\nwas Stevenson who said that to give a bad ending to a story meant to end\r\nhappily, or vice versa, was an unpardonable literary crime, and we must\r\nhold the authors of “Daphne and Her Lad” guilty of this offense. The\r\nstory was not framed along the tragic lines which logically or\r\nartistically lead to hopeless misery, and the final impression is\r\ndisturbing and ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MILLIONAIRE BABY. By ANNA KATHERINE GREEN. The Bobbs-Merrill\r\n    Company, Indianapolis. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nA startling crime, innumerable clues, the gradual elimination of every\r\nreasonable and plausible theory, and the construction of the wildest,\r\nmost improbable explanation to fit the problem—these are the lines on\r\nwhich the detective stories of Anna Katherine Green are invariably\r\nframed, and “The Millionaire Baby” is no exception to the rule. A little\r\ngirl, heiress to an immense fortune, is kidnapped during a garden fete\r\nat her parents’ palatial home on the Hudson, under most unusual\r\ncircumstances, and the reader is at once lost in a labyrinth of\r\nmysterious old men, magnetic ladies, amazing coincidences, and secret\r\nchambers. The way out is pointed ultimately by a young detective, and\r\nthe reader emerges feeling rather “sold.” Despite the writer’s\r\nunspeakable rhetoric and crude methods, her stories have a way of\r\ngetting themselves read, and a large constituency will welcome “The\r\nMillionaire Baby.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  TENNESSEE HISTORY STORIES.

Johnson Publishing\r\n    Co., Richmond, Va.\r\n\r\nThe writer belongs to that loyal band of missionaries who are spreading\r\nabroad among the children of the nation the knowledge of the importance\r\nof the western chain of settlements on the Tennessee and Kentucky\r\nfrontiers in the history of the United States. The stories he tells of\r\nJohn Sevier, of James Robertson and Daniel Boone, while written for the\r\nchildren, are well worth reading and the book is sure to earn a place in\r\nthe curriculum of the primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE FIDDLE AND THE BOW.\r\n\r\n                          By Robert L. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe dream of a heaven beyond the stars, but there are heavens all around\r\nus with beautiful gates ajar to those who have eyes to see and ears to\r\nhear. I have seen heavens of delight where the meadows flashed with dew\r\nand the crows were on the wing. I have seen heavens of music where the\r\nlinnet swept her lute and the thrush rang his silver bells in the dusky\r\nchambers of the forest.\r\n\r\nI once sat on the grassy brink of a southern stream in the gathering\r\ntwilight of evening and listened to a concert of Nature’s musicians who\r\nsang as God hath taught them to sing. The katydid led off with a\r\ntrombone solo; the cricket chimed in with his E flat cornet; the\r\nbumble-bee played on his violincello, and the jaybird laughed with his\r\npiccolo. The music rose to grandeur with the deep bass horn of the big\r\nblack beetle; the mocking-bird’s flute brought me to tears of rapture,\r\nand the screech-owl’s fife made me want to fight; the tree-frog blew his\r\nalto horn; the jar-fly clashed his tinkling cymbals; the woodpecker\r\nrattled his kettledrum and the locust jingled his tambourine. The music\r\nrolled along like a sparkling river in sweet accompaniment with the\r\noriole’s leading violin; but it suddenly hushed when I heard a ripple of\r\nlaughter among the hollyhocks before the door of a happy country home. I\r\nsaw a youth standing there in the shadows holding his sweetheart’s hand\r\nin his. There were a few whispers, tender and low—the lassie vanished in\r\nthe cottage—the lad vanished over the hill, and as he vanished he swung\r\nhis hat in the shadows and sang back to her his happy love song:\r\n\r\n                 “My thoughts will fly to thee, my own,\r\n                   Swift as a dove,\r\n                 To cheer thee when alone,\r\n                   My own true love.”\r\n\r\nAnd the birds inclined their heads to listen to his song as it died away\r\non the drowsy evening air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  I saw a youth holding his sweetheart’s hand.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat night I slept in a mansion\r\n\r\n                “I closed my eyes on garnished rooms\r\n                To dream of meadows and clover blooms,”\r\n\r\nbut while I dreamed, I was serenaded by a band of mosquitoes and this is\r\nthe song they sang above my pillow:\r\n\r\n        “Buz-z-z! buz-z-z! no bars around this bed,\r\n          Buz-z-z! buz-z-z! no hair upon this head, mosquitoes,\r\n        Buz-z-z! buz-z-z! we’ll paint old baldy red,\r\n          There’ll be a hot time in the old town to-night!”\r\n\r\nThere are heavens all around us with beautiful gates ajar. I have seen a\r\nJune morning unbar a gate of roses and come forth from her palace in the\r\nsky bearing in her girdle of light the keys to a thousand heavens. I\r\nhave seen her kindle a sun in every dewdrop and touch the waking hills\r\nwith glory. I caught the odor of honeysuckles and the note of a lark as\r\nit rose exultant from the meadow. There were the glimmer of painted\r\nwings among the clover blossoms and the hum of teeming bees rich with\r\nthe spoils of plundered beauty. There were the green trail of a winding\r\nriver and the low music of its joyous waters dashing among the rocks of\r\ndistant rapids. I heard the shouts and splashes of noisy boys down at\r\nthe old swimming hole under the spreading elms. An old time darky went\r\nshambling by, with his cup of bait and his fishing pole. The wine of\r\nJune was in his veins and he tangled his song with the honey song of the\r\nbees:\r\n\r\n                    “O, my Hannah, lady,\r\n                      I do a-love-a you!\r\n                    They ain’t no baby\r\n                      So good and true!\r\n                    In Louisiana I could die,\r\n                    If you wuz only nigh!\r\n                      O, tell me, Hannah, lady,\r\n                      Whose black-a-baby is a-you?”\r\n\r\nAnd he cut the pigeon wing in the clover and then sat down on a\r\nbumble-bee. It invited him to rise, and he rose; and it was difficult\r\nfor the old man to tell which was the warmer—the June in his heart or\r\nthe June in the bumble-bee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  He cut the pigeon wing in the clover.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The convict’s plea for pardon.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA lovesick lad met his sweetheart down in the shady lane and poured out\r\nhis soul to her under the locust bloom. I saw him push his boat from the\r\nshore and dip his oars in the clear heaven of the crystal waters. She\r\nwas his only companion. And as the painted keel darted away like a bird\r\nbeneath the bending boughs and went skimming round the bend of the river\r\nI heard their voices blending up among the cliffs and shadows singing a\r\nsweet love song. To him, she was a full blow’n rose of beauty; to her,\r\nhe was a daisy. To him her ribbons were streaks of light; to her his\r\nfuzzy upper lip was a poem. They floated and fished and fished and\r\nfloated away the golden hours; and while they fished and floated, he\r\nwooed her—he wooed and he wooed and he wooed—until, at length, he won\r\nher; and, as they floated homeward in the evening, dreaming of wedding\r\nbells and orange blossoms,\r\n\r\n             He held her soft little hand in his,\r\n               Smoothing her hair so brown;\r\n             The boat struck a rock and they both fell in,\r\n              Just as the sun went down!\r\n\r\nI looked upon these scenes of light and love and I walked in the heaven\r\nof the beautiful, the somnambulist of a rapturous dream.\r\n\r\nO, matchless dream maker, voluptuous June! Enchantress of the sun, Eden\r\nbuilder of the world! There is a magic in thy touch which melts the\r\nicicles in the veins of age and makes the tropic blood of youth run\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nThere are heavens all around us with beautiful gates ajar: I have seen\r\nOctober open a gate of opal and I walked in the heaven of autumnal\r\nglory. I have seen her splash the forest with the tints of a thousand\r\nshattered rainbows, and then draw the misty veil of Indian summer—that\r\nmysterious phantom of the air that conjures the sunlight into yellow\r\namber and turns the world into a dream.\r\n\r\nI joined the farmers in the jubilee of the county fair, and walked\r\nthrough streets of pumpkins, purple avenues of turnips, and fragrant\r\nboulevards of onions, enough to bring the world to tears.\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of the hunter’s horn at the break of day. I mounted\r\nmy gallant steed and galloped away to the rendezvous, and every breath\r\nof the cool, crisp October air was like a draught of exhilarating wine.\r\nThe hunters assembled at the appointed place, the eager hounds were\r\nunleashed and they scurried away like ghosts in the gloomy woods. They\r\ncoursed and circled like flying shadows—now and then giving tongue as\r\nthey took up the scent of some cold and doubtful trail. Faster and\r\nfaster they circled, until they jumped the fox from his covert and\r\nopened in full cry, and it was like a sudden burst of music from a band.\r\nAway they bounded, bellowing their deep-mouthed serenade to the wily\r\nknight of the red plume, who showed them a clean pair of heels. They\r\npushed him up the rocky steeps and pressed him down the dusky hollows,\r\nthey swung him through the highland gaps and whirled him round the\r\nridges. Over the hills and round the knob Sir Reynard led the band until\r\nthe waking echoes caught up the flying melody and sent it pulsing from\r\ncliff to cliff and from crag to crag! On fled the fox with tireless\r\nleap! on followed the hounds with smoking mouths! On and on, over hill\r\nand dale, through forest and field until finally the music died away\r\nlike the chime of distant bells!\r\n\r\nHow sweet are the lips of morning that kiss the waking world; how sweet\r\nis the bosom of night that pillows the world to rest; but sweeter than\r\nthe lips of morning and sweeter than the bosom of night is the voice of\r\nmusic that wakes a world of joys and soothes a world of sorrows. It is\r\nlike some unseen ethereal ocean whose silver surf forever breaks in\r\nsong. All nature is full of music. There is a melody in every sunbeam, a\r\nsunbeam in every melody. There is a love song in every flower, a sonnet\r\nin every gurgling fountain, a hymn in every rolling billow. Music is the\r\ntwin angel of light, the first born of heaven, and mortal ear and mortal\r\neye have caught only the echo and the shadow of their celestial glories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  He wooed and he wooed and he wooed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe violin is the poet laureate of music—violin of the virtuoso and\r\nmaster, fiddle of the untutored in the ideal art. It is the aristocrat\r\nof the palace and the hall; it is the democrat of the unpretentious home\r\nand humble cabin. As violin, it weaves its garlands of roses and\r\ncamellias; as fiddle it scatters its modest violets. It is admired by\r\nthe cultured for its magnificent powers and wonderful creations. It is\r\nloved by the millions for its simple melodies.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning just before Christmas Day, an official stood in the\r\nexecutive chamber in my presence as governor of Tennessee, and said:\r\n\r\n“Governor, I have been implored by a poor, miserable wretch in the\r\npenitentiary to bring you this rude fiddle. It was made by his own hands\r\nwith a penknife during the hours allotted to him for rest. It is\r\nentirely without value, as you can see, but it is his petition to you\r\nfor mercy. He begged me to say that he has neither influential friends\r\nnor attorneys to plead for him; and all that he asks is that, when the\r\ngovernor shall sit at his own happy fireside on Christmas eve with his\r\nown happy children around him, he will play one tune to them on this\r\nrough fiddle and think of a cabin far away in the mountains whose\r\nhearthstone is cold and desolate and surrounded by a family of poor\r\nlittle helpless ragged children, crying for bread and waiting and\r\nlistening for the footsteps of their father.”\r\n\r\nWho would not have been touched by such an appeal? The record was\r\nexamined. Christmas eve came. The governor sat that night at his own\r\nhappy fireside, with his own happy children around him and he played one\r\ntune to them on that rough fiddle. The fireside of the cabin in the\r\nmountains was bright and warm. A pardoned prisoner sat with his baby on\r\nhis knee, surrounded by his happy children and in the presence of his\r\nrejoicing wife. And, although there was naught but rags and squalid\r\npoverty around him his heart sang,\r\n\r\n                     “Be it ever so humble,\r\n                       There’s no place like home.”\r\n\r\nWhen I used to play the role of governor of the old Volunteer State, I\r\noften felt the stings of criticism for the liberal use of the pardoning\r\npower. But I saw old mothers with their white locks and wrinkled brows\r\nswoon at the governor’s feet every day. I saw old fathers with broken\r\nhearts and tear-stained faces and heard them plead by the hour for their\r\nwayward boys. I saw a wife and seven children clad in tatters and rags\r\nand barefooted in midwinter fall down upon their knees around him who\r\nheld the pardoning power. I saw a little girl climb upon the governor’s\r\nknee and put her little arms around his neck and I heard her ask him if\r\nhe had little girls; and then I saw her sob upon his bosom as though her\r\nlittle heart would break and heard her plead for mercy for her poor,\r\nmiserable, wretched convict father. I saw want and woe and agony and\r\nanguish unutterable pass before the gubernatorial door. And I said: “Let\r\nthis heartless world condemn! let the critics frown and rail, but he who\r\nhath power and doth not temper justice with mercy will cry in vain\r\nhimself for mercy on that great day when God shall judge the merciful\r\nand the unmerciful!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SOUTHERN\r\n                                PLATFORM\r\n                               DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONDUCTED IN\r\n\r\n                              THE INTEREST\r\n\r\n                             of THE LYCEUMS\r\n\r\n                              of THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Southern Platform]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of this department is to present to the readers of BOB TAYLOR’S\r\nMAGAZINE, and particularly to those who are directly interested in the\r\nLyceum, all obtainable information with reference to the bright lights\r\nof the platform—the men and women of real genius, whose work has\r\ncontributed to the establishing and development of an interest in that\r\nhigher and more wholesome entertainment to which all enlightened\r\ncommunities are rapidly turning, from the coarser and more purposeless\r\nforms of amusement.

And he adds,\r\nsignificantly, that it would make no difference in telling it to the\r\npeople of China what the customs were—that the human interest in the\r\nstory is so powerful it sweeps all minor details to one side.\r\n\r\nJoseph is not at all a perfect man. He hasn’t the kind of faults that\r\nDavid possessed, that show clearly to the person that isn’t even looking\r\nfor them; but he has what seem to be more terrible faults because they\r\nare gilded over with success. And I can think of no character in history\r\nmore magnanimous than was Joseph, for when his father was dead and his\r\nbrethren came to him and were afraid that he would be avenging, he wept\r\nat their doubting him, and then said these significant words: “Fear not:\r\nfor am I in the place of God?” It seems to me that these are the words\r\nthat best show the high ideal that ruled Joseph. As far as I can see it\r\nis the same spirit which was in Luther, only in another form—that is,\r\nthat each one of us must settle all our doubts with God alone. Human\r\nhelp is unavailing here. Such a high ideal as this of Joseph fills me\r\nwith awe and reverent admiration, and when I realize that he was at the\r\nhead of, and the former and the creator of the most stupendous trust\r\nthat the world has ever known, I find myself bewildered in trying to\r\nreconcile such different elements in one man,—Joseph’s tenderness and\r\nmagnanimity to his brethren, and Joseph’s creating a trust which forced\r\nthe Egyptians to sell their land to him and finally their bodies as\r\nslaves to ward off starvation. Think of one man combining such opposite\r\nqualities. Is it because the golden rule that Christ gave us had not yet\r\ncome into the world? Of course Joseph did what John D. Rockefeller is\r\ntrying to do, and has in no small degree accomplished, though perhaps we\r\ndo not see the slave-chains that he has put upon us. But John D.\r\nRockefeller hasn’t, as far as we know, the godlike nature that Joseph\r\nhad. He and Joseph are alike in each possessing the inhuman quality of\r\nbeing able to crush out the life of their fellowmen.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Joseph created this trust and carried it out merely because\r\nhe was a man of business, or because he enjoyed the game he was at, as\r\ndoes Russell Sage. Until I began to study this story, I never knew what\r\nthe parable of the wise and foolish virgins meant, but it seems plain to\r\nme now. Joseph was like the wise virgin. The thirteen years which he\r\nspent as a slave and in prison he gave entirely to living each moment to\r\nthe glory of God. He wasted no time in bearing hatred towards his\r\nbrethren, or thinking how much better he was than the position he\r\noccupied, or wishing God wouldn’t forget him quite so long, but would\r\ntry and be a little more attentive to him personally. No, he simply did\r\neach act in the best and sunniest way, and the day when Pharaoh sent\r\nhastily for him and they brought him hurriedly out of the prison, he\r\nstopped and shaved himself and changed his raiment. Why? Because he was\r\na gentleman and he had been in the habit of daily shaving and of daily\r\ncaring for his body in the best possible way. And when we read that he\r\ncame in to Pharaoh we know exactly how he walked, with the calm\r\nquietness that belongs to a person that has sufficient self-respect to\r\nlast through the night and lap over into the next morning.\r\n\r\nGibbon, in his “History of Rome,” says that the hatred between the\r\nreligions began about the fourth century; that people before that had\r\nbeen willing that people should worship as they thought best, the idea\r\nbeing that all were striving for the same noble end. I wonder if there\r\nwas something of this beautiful spirit in Egypt. It has made a\r\ntremendous impression upon me that Moses, a Hebrew, in telling the story\r\nsays that the Egyptians would not eat with the Hebrews because it is an\r\nabomination for Egyptians to eat with Hebrews. One would have thought\r\nthat Moses would have put the Hebrew first, naturally caring most for\r\nhis own. And I keep wondering whether he put them in the inferior\r\nposition of making them second because of that same exquisite courtesy\r\nwhich Lincoln exercised when he always mentioned the North first, as\r\nthough they were the more guilty in everything connected with the War;\r\nor was it because the Egyptians were the most powerful nation, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, should be mentioned first? This, however, is but a side\r\nissue to the wonderful fact that though the Egyptians would not eat with\r\nthe Hebrews, yet Pharaoh and Potiphar immediately saw, and Pharaoh\r\npublicly announced, that the Spirit of God was in Joseph. Why, I hardly\r\nknow anyone who is an enthusiastic church worker that feels that the\r\nspirit of God is really and surely in a church worker of another\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MRS.

It is erroneously supposed that they were in very humble\r\ncircumstances, in fact, little more than peasants, and the question is\r\nfrequently asked: “Is it possible that a man of such humble origin and\r\nwith such limited opportunities of mental development, could have\r\nwritten a series of plays that indicate such universal knowledge of men\r\nand manners and display such transcendent genius?”\r\n\r\nHazlett, in one of his essays, truly says: “No really great man ever\r\nthought himself to be one,” and I doubt if Shakespeare in his wildest\r\ndreams ever imagined that the world would credit him with the sublime\r\ngenius that it now justly acknowledges. We find no memoirs or\r\nautobiographic notes to enlighten us as to his hopes, his fears, his\r\nambitions, the thoughts that occupy his mind, or the details of his\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be deplored that we have so little authentic\r\ninformation as to the life of Shakespeare. The facts, however, that have\r\nbeen gleaned from the meagre records of the period, conflicting though\r\nthey be, enable us to arrive, with some degree of accuracy, at the\r\nprobabilities, if not the actual facts of his history. Supplementing\r\nthese facts with some imagination, intelligently directed, I think we\r\nare justified in the conclusion that there is nothing inconsistent with\r\nthe conditions of his birth, parentage, education, the environment of\r\nhis youth, and the universality of the genius subsequently displayed.\r\n\r\nThe father of Shakespeare was legally a gentleman, by a license from\r\nKing Henry VII, granting him a crest and a coat of arms, and the\r\nprivilege of bearing arms for substantial services rendered his\r\nsovereign; and it is recorded that this honor was not only bestowed for\r\nhis own individual services, but was renewed by inheritance from his\r\nfather and grandfather; so that, engaged in peaceful pursuits himself,\r\nhe was honorably descended from warriors and fighting men, almost the\r\nsole means of obtaining distinction in those days.\r\n\r\nWe have no means of discovering if John Shakespeare was a man of any\r\neducation. The fact that he made his mark instead of signing his name to\r\npublic documents being no evidence to the contrary, for at the period in\r\nwhich he lived, the art of pencraft was almost entirely limited to\r\nclerks and scholars; even gentlemen and men of quality holding it “a\r\nbaseness to write fair.” Yet Sidney Lee assures us there is evidence in\r\nthe Stratford archives that he (John Shakespeare) could write with\r\nfacility. The offices held by him in the Borough of Stratford indicate\r\nthat he was a man of more than average intelligence among his fellows,\r\nand of considerable executive ability. After holding several minor\r\noffices he was elected successively one of the Chamberlains (1561),\r\nAlderman (1565), Borough Bailiff (1569), and Chief Alderman (1571), and\r\nby the county records was possessed at various times of considerable\r\nproperty, principally real estate. In the deeds relating to the transfer\r\nof this property he is sometimes described as “yeoman,” at others as a\r\n“glover,” and it is known that he dealt in cattle, corn and country\r\nproduce generally.\r\n\r\nIf asked what was the strongest influence for good in their lives, I\r\nthink most men of any worth or eminence would reply, “My mother.” In\r\nthis respect Shakespeare was most fortunate. His mother was Mary Arden,\r\nthe youngest of seven daughters of Robert Arden of Wilmecote, whose\r\ntenant Richard Shakespeare, the father of John, had been; and who, on\r\nher marriage to John Shakespeare, brought him a good estate in money and\r\nproperty. The Ardens were an old family of good standing and consequence\r\nin the midland counties of England, tracing a long line of honorable\r\nancestry, and worthily representing that substantial and independent\r\nclass, “the yeoman squires of England.” Rowe asserts that this worthy\r\ncouple (John and Mary Shakespeare) had ten children, but the parish\r\nregister of Stratford makes the number only eight. However, William was\r\nthe eldest son, though not the first child.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Mary Arden was a woman of any great\r\naccomplishments, but it is reasonable to suppose from the position and\r\nwealth of her family she was not without education. It is also\r\nreasonable to suppose that in spite of the onerous duties of such a\r\nlarge family Shakespeare’s mother should have found time to guide and\r\nform the youthful mind of her eldest son, and impart to him the first\r\nrudiments of knowledge. His father at that period was well-to-do and\r\nabundantly able to provide his family with comfortable surroundings and\r\nadequate service.\r\n\r\nThus the first seven years of Shakespeare’s life were passed in comfort\r\nand comparative affluence, under the care of a father who was honored\r\nand respected for his ability and integrity by his fellow-townsmen, and\r\na mother whose family and connections would indicate a woman of worth\r\nand refinement.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Stratford was a Free School, founded in the reign of\r\nEdward IV and subsequently chartered by Edward VI—one of those\r\nfoundation schools of which a number exist in England to-day, notably,\r\nChrist’s (the blue-coat school), made familiar to us by Thackeray, in\r\nThe Newcombs; the City of London School, St. Paul’s, and The\r\nCharterhouse. To the Free School was Shakespeare sent, and it is said\r\nattended it until he was fourteen years old.\r\n\r\nThere are no records of Shakespeare’s life at school to indicate if he\r\nwere an apt scholar. We have no account of the course of study pursued\r\nby him, but from Ben Jonson’s statement that Shakespeare “knew a little\r\nLatin and less Greek,” the inference is that it was (in part, at least)\r\na classical one, and the quotations in his plays, imperfect as they are,\r\nindicate that he must have studied with some diligence.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen Shakespeare left school to assist his father, who\r\nat this time had met with some business reverses, and we have little or\r\nno record of his life until his nineteenth year when, in the autumn of\r\n1582 he married Anne Hathaway, the daughter of a substantial yeoman of\r\nShottery, the village adjoining Stratford. The baptism of his daughter\r\nSusanna is next recorded on May 26, 1583; and that of a son Hamnet and a\r\ndaughter, Judith (twins), on Feb. 2, 1585. His departure for London\r\nfollowed, probably in 1586.\r\n\r\nOf Shakespeare’s migration to London and his life in that city I do not\r\npropose to speak here, but from the foregoing facts, it will be seen\r\nthat Shakespeare came of a good family, enjoyed in his infancy tender\r\nparental care, and received the rudiments of a sound and substantial\r\neducation at a period of his life when the youthful mind is most\r\nreceptive.\r\n\r\nTo an intelligent observer the influences and experiences of his youth\r\nare clearly reflected in the work of his later years.\r\n\r\nA mere cursory reading of the plays will show his intimate knowledge of\r\nthe Holy Scriptures, probably begun at his mother’s knee and continued\r\nin his leisure hours—the Bible being one of the few books within his\r\nreach at that time.\r\n\r\nIn the pastoral scenes we cannot but marvel at the knowledge he displays\r\nof forestry, botany, the flora of the fields and woods, and the nature\r\nand habits of the animals, birds and insects.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a slight stretch of imagination to see young Shakespeare\r\nas a sturdy country lad strolling with his youthful companions by the\r\nside of the gentle Avon. Noting the flight of the swallow over its\r\nglassy surface, the nodding reeds and grasses on its sedgy banks, and\r\ndart of the startled pickerel from its weedy lair, unconsciously\r\nabsorbing by his yet undeveloped genius of observation the minute\r\nknowledge of nature that is so perfectly displayed in “As You Like It”\r\nand other silvan plays.\r\n\r\nWe see him wandering through the meadows listening to the lark rising\r\nwith its morning song on high; by the little gardens where the primrose,\r\nthe cowslip and the yellow daffodil grow round the cottage door, and the\r\nivy and the honeysuckle climb the rustic porch; in the green lanes\r\nbetween the quickset hedges where the modest violets lift their purple\r\nheads upon the mossy banks. May not the youthful Shakespeare himself\r\nhave seen in the woods of Charlecote or Shottery “the poor sequestered\r\nstag that from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt” augment with his tears\r\nthe already swollen stream, and himself startled the timid hare and the\r\nantlered deer from their leafy coverts, and in those majestic solitudes\r\nfound “tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones,\r\nand good in everything?”\r\n\r\nPicture young Shakespeare hand in hand with gentle Anne Hathaway, in\r\ntheir walks in the unfrequented paths of Shottery and Stratford,\r\ncharming her mind with the poetry of his nature, the glow of admiration\r\ndeepening into love for her youthful suitor; the bridegroom standing at\r\nthe altar assuming the responsibilities of marriage before nineteen\r\nyears had passed over his head, and the pride of paternity when his\r\nfirst child was born; and realize the sense of importance of the\r\ndeparture of the youthful husband and father for London. Whether to\r\nbetter his fortunes or to escape from the anger of Sir Thomas Lucy after\r\nhis unlucky escapade on that worthy gentleman’s estate at Charlecote,\r\nmatters not.\r\n\r\nThese I conceive to be some of the factors in the formation of the mind\r\nand character of William Shakespeare: a mother’s gentle influence, a\r\nfair mental development at school, an early appreciation of the\r\nvicissitudes of fortune and the necessities of labor, a love of nature\r\ndeveloped by the surroundings of his youth, a remarkable capacity of\r\nobservation, and an experience of the sacred mystery of love, marriage\r\nand paternity ere he had arrived at years of mature manhood; and they do\r\nnot appear to be at all incompatible with the life, the knowledge, the\r\nfriendships, the accomplishments and the genius which the world has\r\nconceded to this great and glorious man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MASQUERADER.\r\n\r\n                      By Katherine Cecil Thurston.\r\n\r\nGrasp and constructive ability are the two attributes of genius or of\r\ntalent absolutely necessary to a novelist. When Katherine Cecil Thurston\r\ngrasped the results that bound together those two incidents of January\r\ntwenty-third, incidents so widely different in character, she created\r\nnovelistic material. To this material she applied the same constructive\r\nability, but maturer, that she evidenced in “The Circle.” And from the\r\nfirst statement in her book, that these incidents were bound by results,\r\nthe reader’s interest does not flag till the last phase of the\r\ncomplicated result is clearly given, as it is in the final statement of\r\nthe final chapter. Nor then, for it is a book to hold after it is\r\nclosed, while the mind reverts to its scenes and its interest in\r\npleasant retrospect.\r\n\r\nSelf-accusation may follow analysis of the book, for, after all, nothing\r\nis actually acquired in the reading. The aggressive, acquisitive\r\nattitude of Russia, which is the one historical episode of the novel,\r\nhas been made so much clearer and so much more forcible in the last\r\ntwelve months than a mere statement or even a masterful speech can make\r\nit that the book is not worth reading for this episode.\r\n\r\nTo repeat, it is the situation that grew out of the chance meeting in\r\nthe fog, the interchanging of identities, that holds the interest so\r\nabsorbingly. This contrast of similarity, if the paradoxical phrase is\r\npardonable, is dramatic in intensity that grows, and when Eve, the\r\nalienated wife of Chilcote tentatively accepts Loder, the substitute,\r\nthe masquerader, this intensity presents a new aspect that quite absorbs\r\nall others—political, social, even practical. From that moment the\r\ninterest centers in the final outcome when she will discover or be told\r\nof the substitution. And because of this interest, which lasts even\r\nafter the book is read, the inconsistency of the situation is forgiven\r\nand the impossible accepted as possible.\r\n\r\nReason rejects the position but charm is a matter of the emotions and\r\nthe charm of “The Masquerader” is such as to put the emotions in the\r\nascendency. It is sufficient to have carried the book to almost twice\r\nthe popularity of any other recent book and to have kept it there for\r\ntwo months—quite a period in the life of an ephemeral novel. It is\r\nsufficient to have kept men at the library lamp late at night and to\r\nforce itself in upon business through the next and succeeding days. And\r\nit has made women break the silence of bridge and whist, even where it\r\nhas not kept them from the classes altogether.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency of the situation is the only inconsistency of the\r\nbook. The characters are convincing and stand out in flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nThe palest of these is Lillian, Lady Astrupp, but the paleness is not\r\none of portrayal. It is the paleness of individuality shown in terms to\r\nsuit the character, just as Fraide’s power and ruggedness is shown in\r\nblunt, abrupt allusions and dismissals.\r\n\r\nFor Chilcote there is only sympathy that deepens into pity mixed with\r\ndisgust, the sympathy and pity begotten by the spectacle of a man under\r\nthe power of a habit that has come to be his master.\r\n\r\nThere is resentment towards Loder for assuming another man’s name rather\r\nthan for doing another man’s work, which was his only opportunity. To\r\ncreate is to prove one’s kinship to God, and the instinctive feeling is\r\nthat no strong man would create for another man’s credit. Respect for\r\nLoder would have been aroused had he finally made public the masquerade,\r\nat all costs; but had he done this the climax of the situation would\r\nhave been ruined.\r\n\r\nNeither is Eve’s attitude in the climax inconsistent. Pride is the\r\ndominating characteristic of this woman, who excites admiration in every\r\nsituation where circumstances place her. If it governed her through\r\nyears of unhappiness it would be inconsistent to expect her to yield it\r\nand happiness together for a convention, though it were the divinest\r\nconvention of life.\r\n\r\n                                                        JAMES HUNT COOK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOV.
