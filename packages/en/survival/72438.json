WILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO VOLUME SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this volume an attempt has been made to treat the subject of\r\nfertilizers and fertilizing materials in the manner followed in\r\nthe first volume with soils. The general principles of fertilizer\r\nmanufacture and application have been presented in so far as they\r\nseemed to throw light on the rational method of examination and\r\nanalysis. The standard methods of analysis in use in this and other\r\ncountries, have been presented with sufficient fullness for the\r\nguidance of the skilled worker, and the information of the student. To\r\nthose who make use of a book only for routine work or for preparation\r\nfor an examination, this volume, as its predecessor, will be found to\r\nhave little attraction. This fact, however, will not be a cause of\r\nregret to the author whose purpose has been, avowedly, to present to\r\nthe busy worker and student a broad view of a great subject which each\r\none does not have the time to search out for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret, however, that the contents of the volume\r\nhave again exceeded all expectations. It was found impracticable to\r\nsecure any greater condensation without departing from the purpose,\r\nand impairing the completeness of the work. When work is done with\r\nno prospect of financial compensation, it is gratifying to find it\r\nappreciated, and the author will be content to have this volume meet\r\nwith as kindly a reception as has been accorded volume one.\r\n\r\n                                          HARVEY W.

Introduction.=—In the first volume the principal plant foods\r\noccurring in soils have been named and the methods of estimating them\r\ndescribed. As fertilizers are classed those materials which are added\r\nto soils to supply supposed deficiencies in plant foods, or to render\r\nmore available the stores already present. There is little difference\r\nbetween the terms fertilizer and manure. In common language the former\r\nis applied to goods prepared for the farmer by the manufacturer or\r\nmixer, while the latter is applied to the stores accumulated about the\r\nstables or made elsewhere on the farm. Thus it is common to speak of a\r\nbarnyard or stall manure and of a commercial fertilizer.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of the analysis of soils, as described in the first\r\nvolume of this work, is to determine the character of the fertilizer\r\nwhich should be added to a field in order to secure its maximum\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nOne purpose of the present part is to determine the fitness of offered\r\nfertilizing material to supply the deficiencies which may be revealed\r\nby a proper study of the needs of the soil.\r\n\r\n=2. Natural Fertilizers.=—In the succession of geologic epochs which\r\nhas marked the natural history of the earth there have been brought\r\ntogether in deposits of greater or less magnitude the stores of\r\nplant food unused by growing crops or which may once have been part\r\nof vegetable and animal organisms. Some of these deposits have been\r\nmentioned in the first volume, paragraphs =11, 12=, and =18=.\r\n\r\nFor a full description of the extent and origin of these deposits the\r\nreader is referred to works on economic geology. These deposits are\r\nthe chief sources of the commercial fertilizers which are offered to\r\nthe farmers of to-day and to which the agricultural analyst is called\r\nupon to devote much of his time and labor. The methods of determining\r\nthe chemical composition and agricultural value of these deposits, as\r\npracticed by the leading chemists of this country and Europe, will be\r\nfully set forth in the following pages.\r\n\r\n=3. Waste Matters as Fertilizing Materials.=—In addition to the natural\r\nproducts just mentioned the analyst will be called on also to deal with\r\na great variety of waste materials which, in the last few years, have\r\nbeen saved from the débris of factories and abattoirs, and prepared for\r\nuse on the farm. Among these waste matters may be mentioned, bones,\r\nhorns, hoofs, hair, tankage, dried blood, fish scrap, oil cakes, ashes,\r\nsewage, and sewage precipitates, offal of all kinds, leather scraps,\r\nand organic débris in general.\r\n\r\nIt is important, before beginning an analysis, to know the origin of\r\nthe substances to be determined. As has already been pointed out in\r\nvolume first the process which would be accurate with a substance of\r\na mineral origin might lead to error if applied to the same element\r\nin organic combination. This is particularly true of phosphorus and\r\npotash. A simple microscopic examination will usually enable the\r\nanalyst to determine the nature of the sample. In this manner, in the\r\ncase of a phosphate, it would at once be determined whether it was\r\nbone, mineral, or basic slag. The odor, color, and general consistence\r\nwill also aid in the determination.\r\n\r\n=4. Valuation of Fertilizing Ingredients.=—Perhaps there are no more\r\nnumerous and perplexing questions propounded to the analyst than those\r\nwhich relate to the value of fertilizing materials. There is none\r\nharder to answer. As a rule these questions are asked by the farmer,\r\nand refer to the fertilizers put down on his fields. In such cases\r\nthe cost of transportation is an important factor in the answer. The\r\nfarther the farmer is removed from the place of fertilizer manufacture\r\nthe greater, as a rule, will be the cost. Whether the transportation is\r\nover land or by water also plays an important part in the final cost.\r\nThe discovery of new stores of fertilizing materials has also much to\r\ndo with the price. This fact is especially noticeable in this country,\r\nwhere the price of crude phosphates at the mines has fallen in a few\r\nyears from nearly six dollars to three dollars and forty-three cents\r\nper ton[1]. This decrease has been largely due to discoveries of vast\r\nbeds of phosphatic deposits in Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\nVirginia. The state of trade, magnitude of crops, and the vigor of\r\ncommerce also affect, in a marked degree, the cost of the raw materials\r\nof commercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\n=5.

In such\r\nmaterials the insoluble phosphoric acid is valued at two cents a pound.\r\nThese values change as the markets vary.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of valuation prepared by the Massachusetts station does not\r\ninclude phosphoric acid in basic slags. By many experimenters the value\r\nof the acid in this combination, tetracalcium phosphate, is fully equal\r\nto that in superphosphates soluble in water and ammonium citrate. It\r\nwould perhaps be safe to assign that value to all the phosphoric acid\r\nin basic slags soluble in a five per cent citric acid solution.\r\n\r\nUntreated fine-ground phosphates, especially of the soft variety, so\r\nabundant in many parts of Florida, have also a high manurial value when\r\napplied to soils of an acid nature or rich in humus. On other soils\r\nof a sandy nature, or rich in calcium carbonate, such a fertilizer\r\nwould have little value. The analyst in giving an opinion respecting\r\nthe commercial value of a fertilizer, must be guided not only by the\r\nsource of the material, its fineness or state of decomposition, and its\r\ngeneral physical qualities, but also by the nature of the crop which it\r\nis to nourish and the kind of soil to which it is to be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ANALYTICAL PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n=6. Taking Samples.=—It is impracticable to give definite directions\r\nfor taking samples of fertilizers which will be applicable to all kinds\r\nof material and in all circumstances. If the chemist himself have\r\ncharge of the taking of the sample, it will probably be sufficient to\r\nsay that it should accurately represent the total mass of material\r\nsampled. Generally the samples which are brought to the chemist have\r\nbeen taken without his advice or direction and he is simply called upon\r\nto make an analysis of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR CRUSHING MINERAL FERTILIZERS.]\r\n\r\n=7. Minerals Containing Fertilizing Materials.=—When possible, the\r\nsamples should be accompanied by a description of the mines where\r\nthey are procured and a statement of the geologic conditions in which\r\nthe deposits were made. As large a quantity of the material as can be\r\nconveniently obtained and transported should be secured. Where a large\r\nquantity of mineral matter is at hand it should first be put through a\r\ncrusher. Many forms of crusher, driven by hand and other power, are on\r\nthe market. Among these may be mentioned the Alden, Blake, Bisworth,\r\nForster, and Lipsay machines.[3] They are all constructed essentially\r\non the same principle, the pieces of mineral being broken into small\r\nfragments between two heavy vibrating steel plates. The general form of\r\nthese instruments is seen in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe fragments coming from the crusher can be reduced to a coarse powder\r\nby means of the iron plate and crusher shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nWhere only a small quantity of mineral is at hand the apparatus just\r\nmentioned may be used at once after breaking the sample into small\r\nfragments by means of a hammer.\r\n\r\nFinally the sample, if to be dissolved in an acid or soluble materials\r\nonly, is reduced to a powder in an iron mortar until it will pass a\r\nsieve with a one or, better, one-half millimeter circular mesh. The\r\npowder thus obtained must be stirred with a magnet to remove all iron\r\nparticles that may have been incorporated with the mass by abrasion of\r\nthe instruments employed.\r\n\r\nIf a complete mineral analysis of the sample is to be secured, the\r\nmaterial freed from iron, as above described, is to be rubbed to an\r\nimpalpable powder in an agate mortar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.\r\n\r\nPLATE GRINDER FOR MINERALS.]\r\n\r\n=8. Mixed Fertilizers.=—In fertilizing materials in bulk, the first\r\nrequisite is that they shall be thoroughly mixed so that a given volume\r\nof the material may represent, practically, definite quantities of the\r\nmaterials sampled. The finer the material is, in the original state,\r\nand the more thoroughly it has been mixed, the better the sample will\r\nbe. If the sample be already in sacks it will be sufficient to take\r\nportions by means of the ordinary trier, such as is used for sampling\r\nsugar and other substances. This consists of a long metal implement\r\nsuch as would be formed by a longitudinal section of a tube. The end\r\nis pointed and suited for penetrating into the sack and the materials\r\ncontained therein. On withdrawing it, the semi-circular concavity is\r\nfound filled with the material sampled. Samples in this way should\r\nbe taken from various parts of the sack and these samples well mixed\r\ntogether and a subsample of the amount necessary to be taken to the\r\nlaboratory can then be obtained.\r\n\r\n=9. Method of the French Experiment Stations.=—In the method employed\r\nby the French Experiment Stations it is directed that in no case should\r\nstones or other foreign particles be removed from the fertilizer\r\nsampled, but they should enter into the sample taken in, as nearly as\r\npossible, the same proportions as they exist in the whole mass.\r\n\r\nIn the case of stones or other solid masses which are to be sampled, as\r\nmany samples as possible should be taken from all parts of the heap and\r\nthese should be reduced to a coarse powder, thoroughly mixed together\r\nand sampled.\r\n\r\nIn case the material is in the form of a paste, if it is homogeneous,\r\nit will be sufficient to mix it well and take the sample directly; but\r\nin case there is a tendency for the pasty mass to separate into two\r\nparts, of which the one is a liquid and the other, more of a solid\r\nconsistence, it may be well to take samples from each in case they can\r\nnot be thoroughly incorporated by stirring.\r\n\r\n=10. Method of the French Association of Sugar Chemists.=—The method\r\nadopted by the French sugar chemists directs that the sample should be\r\ntaken from the fertilizer in bulk or from a portion used for industrial\r\npurposes.[4] The sample for analysis is to be taken from the above\r\nsample after it has been sent to the laboratory. The method of taking\r\nshould be varied according to the condition of the substances to be\r\nanalyzed.\r\n\r\nThe large sample selected from the goods delivered to commerce having\r\nbeen delivered at the laboratory, the analytical sample is taken as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nWhen the industrial sample, more or less voluminous, reaches the\r\nlaboratory, the chemist is to begin by taking a note of the marks,\r\nlabels, and descriptions found thereon, and of the nature and state of\r\nthe package which contains it, and the date of its arrival. All this\r\ninformation should be entered upon the laboratory book and afterwards\r\ntranscribed on the paper containing the results of the analysis, as\r\nwell as the name of the person sending it. This having been done, the\r\nsample is to be properly prepared in order that a portion may be taken\r\nrepresenting exactly the mean composition of the whole.\r\n\r\nIf it is in a state of fine powder, such as ground phosphates and\r\ncertain other fertilizers, it is sufficient to pass it two or three\r\ntimes through a sieve with meshes one millimeter in diameter, taking\r\ncare to break up the material each time in order to mix it and\r\nto pulverize the fragments which the sieve retains. The whole is\r\nafterwards spread in a thin layer upon a large sheet of paper, and a\r\nportion is taken here and there upon the point of a knife until about\r\ntwenty grains are removed, and from this the portion subjected to\r\nanalysis is afterwards taken.\r\n\r\nIf the sample comes in fragments, more or less voluminous, such as\r\nphosphatic rocks or coarsely pulverized guanos containing agglomerated\r\nparticles, it is necessary first to reduce the whole to powder by\r\nrubbing it in a mortar or in a small drug mill. It is next passed\r\nthrough a sieve of the size mentioned above and that which remains upon\r\nthe sieve pulverized anew until all has passed through. This precaution\r\nis very important, since the parts which resist the action of the\r\npestle the most have often a composition different from those which are\r\neasily broken.\r\n\r\nWhen the products to be analyzed contain organic materials, such as\r\nhorn, flesh, dry blood, etc., the pulverization is often a long and\r\ndifficult process, and results in a certain degree of heating which\r\ndrives off some of the moisture in such a way that the pulverized\r\nproduct is at the last drier, and, consequently, richer than the\r\nprimitive sample. It is important to take account of this desiccation,\r\nand since the pulverization of a mass so voluminous can not be made\r\nwithout loss, the determination of the total weight of the sample\r\nbefore and after pulverization does not give exact results.\r\n\r\nIn such a case it is indispensable to determine the moisture, both\r\nbefore and after pulverizing, and to calculate the analytical results\r\nobtained upon the pulverized sample back to the original sample.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape this necessity, as well as the difficulties\r\nresulting from the variations in moisture during transportation, some\r\nchemists have thought it better to always dry the commercial products\r\nbefore submitting them to analysis, and to report their results in the\r\ndry state, accompanied by a determination of the moisture, leaving\r\nthus to the one interested the labor of calculating the richness in\r\nthe normal state, that is to say, in the real state in which the\r\nmerchandise was delivered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that this method allows numerous chances\r\nof errors, many substances undergoing important changes in their\r\ncomposition by drying alone, it has been productive of the most serious\r\nconsequences. The sellers have placed their wares on the market with\r\nthe analysis of the material in a dry state, and a great number of\r\npurchasers have not perceived the fraud concealed under this expression\r\nso innocent in appearance. It is thus that there has been met with in\r\nthe markets guano containing twenty-five per cent of water, which was\r\nguaranteed to contain twelve per cent of phosphoric acid, when, in\r\nreality, it contained only eight per cent in the moist state.\r\n\r\n=11. Barn-Yard Manures.=—The sampling of stall and barnyard manures\r\nis more difficult on account of the fact that the materials are not\r\nhomogeneous and that they are usually mixed with straw and other débris\r\nfrom the feed trough, and only the greatest care and patience will\r\nenable the operator to secure a fair sample.\r\n\r\nIn the case of liquid manures the liquid should be thoroughly stirred\r\nbefore the sample is taken.\r\n\r\nFrear points out the difficulty of securing representative samples of\r\nstall manure and describes methods of removing it.[5] The stall manure\r\nsampled had been piled in the cattle-yard for a time and the cattle\r\nwere allowed to run over the heaps for an hour or two each day. Pigs\r\nwere also allowed free access to the heaps in order to insure a more\r\nperfect mixture of the ingredients.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine loads of 3,000 pounds each were taken from the exposed heap\r\nand thirty-four loads of 2,000 pounds each were taken from the covered\r\nheap. From each load were removed two carefully selected portions of\r\nten pounds each, which were placed in separate covered boxes numbered A\r\nand B. When the sampling was completed these boxes were covered. After\r\nbeing removed to the laboratory the boxes were weighed and the contents\r\nthoroughly mixed. Two samples of twelve liters volume each, were drawn\r\nfrom each box. One-third of this was chopped in a large meat chopper\r\nand the other two-thirds taken into the laboratory without being cut.\r\nThese samples, on entering the laboratory, were weighed and dried at a\r\ntemperature of 60°. Smaller samples were then drawn from each of these\r\nand ground in a drug mill for analysis. Duplicate samples taken in this\r\nway, while they did not give absolutely concordant results, showed a\r\nnear approximation. A more careful sampling on the line proposed would,\r\nin all probability, secure absolutely agreeing results in duplicate\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\n=12. Preparation of Sample in Laboratory.=—The method of preparing\r\nmineral fertilizers for analysis has been given under directions for\r\nsampling. Many difficulties attend the proper preparation of other\r\nsamples, and the best approved methods of procedure are given below:\r\n\r\nAccording to the directions given by the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists the sample should be well intermixed, finely\r\nground, and passed through a sieve having circular perforations one\r\nmillimeter in diameter.[6] The processes of grinding and sifting should\r\ntake place as rapidly as possible so that there may be no gain or loss\r\nof moisture during the operation.\r\n\r\n=13. Method of the French Agricultural Stations.=—The manner of\r\nproceeding recommended by the French stations varies with the\r\nfertilizer.[7] If it is not already in the form of a powder it is\r\nnecessary to pulverize it as finely as possible by rubbing it up in a\r\nmortar. In certain cases, as with superphosphates, the material should\r\nbe passed through a sieve having apertures of one millimeter diameter,\r\nall the larger parts being pulverized until they will pass this sieve.\r\n\r\nWhen the matters are too pasty to be divided in the mortar they should\r\nbe divided by means of a knife or a spatula. They should then be\r\nincorporated with a known weight of inert, pulverulent matter such as\r\nfine sand, with which they should be thoroughly mixed and in subsequent\r\ncalculations the quantity of sand or other inert matter added must be\r\ntaken into consideration. Usually a pasty state of a fertilizer is due\r\nto the humidity of the mixture. In this case a considerable volume of\r\nthe sample is taken and dried and then reduced to a pulverulent state.\r\nIn the subsequent calculations, however, the percentage of moisture\r\nlost must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nBefore drying a sample it is necessary to take into consideration\r\nwhether or not the product will be modified by desiccation as would\r\nbe the case, for instance, with superphosphates. With these, which\r\nare often in a state more or less agglomerated, it is recommended to\r\nintroduce into them, in order to divide them, a certain quantity of\r\ncalcium sulfate in order to obtain them in a pulverulent state.\r\n\r\nIn the case of animal débris they should be divided as finely as\r\npossible with the aid of scissors and then passed through a drug mill\r\nif dry enough. They are then mixed by hand and may finally be obtained\r\nin a state of considerable homogeneity.\r\n\r\nWhen fertilizers are in a pasty state more or less liquid, they are\r\ndried at 100°, first introducing a little oxalic acid in case they\r\ncontain any volatile ammoniacal compounds. The product of desiccation\r\nis then passed through a mill. Before treating in this way it is\r\nnecessary to be sure that the composition will not be altered by\r\ndrying. In the case of a mixture containing superphosphates and\r\nnitrate, for instance, drying would eliminate the nitric acid. In\r\nsuch a case the free phosphoric acid should be neutralized with a\r\nbase like lime. In the case of fertilizers containing both nitrates\r\nand volatile ammoniacal compounds the addition of oxalic acid might\r\nalso set free nitric acid during the desiccation. In such a case it\r\nis necessary to dry two samples; one with the addition of oxalic acid\r\nfor the purpose of estimating the ammonia, and the other without the\r\nacid for the purpose of estimating the nitrate. A qualitative analysis\r\nshould precede all the operations so as to determine the nature of the\r\nmaterial to be operated on.\r\n\r\n=14. German Method.=—In the method pursued by the German experiment\r\nstations it is directed:[8]\r\n\r\n(1) Dry samples of fertilizers must be passed through a sieve and\r\nafterwards well mixed.\r\n\r\n(2) With moist fertilizers, which can not be subjected to the above\r\nprocess, the preparation should consist in a careful and thorough\r\nmixing, without sieving.\r\n\r\n(3) On the arrival of the samples in the laboratory their weight should\r\nbe determined. The half of the sample is prepared for analysis and\r\nthe other part, to the amount of a kilo, should be placed in a glass\r\nvessel, closed air-tight, and placed in a cool place for at least a\r\nquarter of a year from the time of its reception, in order that it may\r\nbe subjected to any subsequent investigations which may be demanded.\r\n\r\n(4) In the case of raw phosphates and bone-black the amount of water\r\nwhich they contain should be determined at from 105° to 110°. Samples\r\nwhich in drying lose ammonia in any way, should have this ammonia\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n(5) Samples which are sent to other laboratories for control analyses,\r\nshould be sent securely packed in air-tight glass bottles.\r\n\r\n(6) The weight of the samples sent should be entered in the\r\ncertificates of analysis.\r\n\r\n(7) Samples which, on pulverizing, change their content of water,\r\nmust have the water content estimated in both the coarse and powdered\r\ncondition and the results of the analysis must be calculated to the\r\nwater content of the original coarse substance.\r\n\r\n=15. Special Cases.=—Many cases arise of such a nature as to make it\r\nimpossible to lay down any rule which can be followed with success. As\r\nin almost every other process in agricultural chemistry the analyst in\r\nsuch cases must be guided by his judgment and experience. Keeping in\r\nview the main object, _viz._, to secure in a few grams of material a\r\nfair representation of large masses he will generally be able to reach\r\nthe required result by following the broad principles already outlined.\r\nIn many cases the details of the work and the adaptations necessary to\r\nsuccess must be left to his own determination.\r\n\r\n=16. Drying Samples of Fertilizers.=—The determination of the\r\nuncombined moisture in a sample of fertilizer is not an easy task.\r\nIn some cases, as in powdered minerals, drying to constant weight at\r\nthe temperature of boiling water is sufficient. In organic matters\r\ncontaining volatile nitrogenous compounds, these must first be fixed\r\nby oxalic or sulfuric acid, before the desiccation begins. If any\r\nexcess of sulfuric acid be added, however, drying at 100° becomes\r\nalmost impossible. Particular precautions must be observed in drying\r\nsuperphosphates. In drying samples preparatory to grinding for\r\nanalysis, it is best to stop the process as soon as the materials can\r\nbe pulverized. In general, samples should be dried only to determine\r\nwater, and the analytical processes should be performed on the\r\nundried portions. It is not necessary, as a rule, to dry samples of\r\nfertilizers in an inert atmosphere, such as hydrogen or carbon dioxid.\r\nDrying in vacuo may be practiced when it is desired to secure a speedy\r\ndesiccation or one at a low temperature.\r\n\r\n=17. Official Methods.=—The Official Agricultural Chemists direct, in\r\nthe case of potash salts, sodium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate, to\r\nheat from one to five grams in a flat platinum or aluminum dish at\r\n130° until the weight is constant.[9] The loss in weight is taken to\r\nrepresent the water. In all other cases heat two grams, or five grams\r\nif the sample be very coarse, for five hours in a steam-bath.\r\n\r\nIn the German stations in the case of untreated phosphates and\r\nbone-black the moisture is estimated at from 105° to 110°. Samples\r\nwhich lose ammonia should have the weight of ammonia given off at that\r\ntemperature, determined separately.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of comparison it would be far better to have all contents\r\nof moisture determined at the boiling-point of water. While this varies\r\nwith the altitude and barometric pressure yet it is quite certain that\r\nthe loss on drying to constant weight at all altitudes is practically\r\nthe same. Where the atmospheric pressure is diminished for any cause\r\nthe water escapes all the more easily. This, practically, is a complete\r\ncompensation for the diminished temperature at which water boils.\r\n\r\nWhere the samples contain no ingredient capable of attacking aluminum,\r\nthey can be conveniently dried, in circular dishes of this metal about\r\nseven centimeters in diameter and one centimeter deep, to constant\r\nweight, at the temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\n=18. Moisture in Monocalcium Phosphates.=—In certain fertilizers,\r\nespecially superphosphates, containing the monocalcium salt, the\r\nestimation of water is a matter of extreme difficulty on account of the\r\npresence of free acids and of progressive changes in the sample due to\r\ndifferent degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nStoklasa has studied these changes and reaches the following\r\nresults[10]:\r\n\r\nA chemically pure monocalcium phosphate of the following composition,\r\n_viz._,\r\n\r\n    CaO          22.36 per cent.\r\n    P₂O₅         56.67  “   “\r\n    H₂O          21.53  “   “\r\n\r\nwas subjected to progressive dryings. The loss of water after ten hours\r\nwas 1.83 per cent; after twenty hours, 2.46 per cent; after thirty\r\nhours, 5.21 per cent; after forty hours, 6.32 per cent; after fifty\r\nhours, 6.43 per cent. This loss of water remained constant at 6.43 per\r\ncent. This loss represents one molecule of water as compared with the\r\ntotal molecular magnitude of the mass treated. A calcium phosphate,\r\ntherefore, of the following composition, CaH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O loses, after\r\nforty hours, drying at 100°, its water of crystallization. The calcium\r\nphosphate produced by this method forms opaque crystals which are not\r\nhygroscopic and which give, on analysis, the following numbers:\r\n\r\n    CaO          24.02 per cent.\r\n    P₂O₅         16.74  “   “\r\n    H₂O          15.09  “   “\r\n\r\nThe temperature can be raised to 105° without marked change. If the\r\ntemperature be raised to 200° the decomposition of the molecule is\r\nhastened according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n    4 CaH₄(PO₄)₂ = Ca₂P₂O₇ + Ca(PO₃)₂ + CaH₂P₂O₇ + 2 H₃PO₄ + 4 H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes during the drying of monocalcium phosphates can be\r\nrepresented as follows, temperature 200° for one hour:\r\n\r\n    8[CaH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O] = 4CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + Ca(PO₃)₂ + Ca₂P₂O₇\r\n                           + CaH₂P₂O₇ + 2H₃PO₄ + 12H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe further drying at 200° produces the following decomposition:\r\n\r\n    4CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + Ca(PO₃)₂ + Ca₂P₂O₇ + CaH₂P₂O₇ + 2H₃PO₄\r\n                 = 2Ca(PO₃)₂ + 4CaH₂P₂O₇ + Ca₂P₂O₇ + 2H₃PO₄ + 5H₂O.\r\n\r\n    2Ca(PO₃)₂ + 4CaH₂P₂O₇ + Ca₂PO₇ + 2H₃PO₄\r\n                 = 6Ca(PO₃)₂ + 2CaH₂P₂O₇ + 5H₂O.\r\n\r\nFinally, pyrophosphate at 210° is completely decomposed into\r\nmetaphosphate and water according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n    6Ca(PO₃)₂ + 2CaH₂P₂O₇ = 8Ca(PO₃)₂ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nProvided the drying is made at once at 210° the sum of the changes\r\nproduced as indicated above, can be represented by the following\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n    8[CaH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O] = 8Ca(PO₃)₂ + 24H₂O.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE ANALYSIS OF MINERAL PHOSPHATES.\r\n\r\n=19. Constituents to be Determined.=—The most important point in\r\nthe analysis of mineral phosphates is to determine their content of\r\nphosphoric acid. Of equal scientific interest, however, and often of\r\ngreat commercial importance is the determination of the percentage of\r\nother acids and bases present. The analyst is often called on, in the\r\nexamination of these bodies, to make known the content of water both\r\nfree and combined, of organic and volatile matter, of carbon dioxid,\r\nsulfur, chlorin, fluorin, silica, iron, alumina, calcium, manganese,\r\nmagnesia, and the alkalies. The estimation of some of these bodies\r\npresents problems of considerable difficulty, and it would be vain to\r\nsuppose that the best possible methods are now known. Especially is\r\nthis the case with the processes which relate to the estimation of the\r\nfluorin, silica, iron, alumina, and lime. The phosphoric acid, however,\r\nwhich is the chief constituent from a commercial point of view, it\r\nis believed, can now be determined with a high degree of precision.\r\nOften the estimation of some of the less important constituents is of\r\ngreat interest in determining the origin of the deposits, especially\r\nin the case of fluorin. While the merchant is content with knowing the\r\npercentage of phosphoric acid and the manufacturer asks in addition\r\nonly some knowledge of the quantity of iron, alumina, and lime the\r\nanalyst in most cases is only content with a complete knowledge of the\r\nconstitution of the sample at his disposal.\r\n\r\n=20. Direct Estimation of the Phosphoric Acid.=—It often happens, in\r\nthe case of a mineral phosphate, that the only determination desired\r\nis of the phosphoric acid. In this instance the analyst may proceed as\r\nfollows: If the qualitative test shows the usual amount of phosphoric\r\nacid, two grams of the sample passed through a sieve, with a millimeter\r\nmesh, are placed in a beaker and thoroughly moistened with water. The\r\naddition of water is to secure an even action of the hydrochloric acid\r\non the carbonates present. The beaker is covered with a watch-glass\r\nand a little hydrochloric acid is added from time to time until all\r\neffervescence has ceased. There are then added about thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of aqua regia and the mixture raised to the boiling-point\r\non a sand-bath or over a lamp. The heating is continued until chlorin\r\nis no longer given off and solution is complete. The volume of the\r\nsolution is then made up to 200 cubic centimeters without filtering,\r\nfiltered, and an aliquot part of the filtrate, usually fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters, representing half a gram of the original sample, taken\r\nfor the determination of the phosphoric acid according to the method\r\nof the Official Agricultural Chemists. The small quantity of insoluble\r\nmaterial does not introduce any appreciable error into the process when\r\nthe volume is made up to 200 or 250 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n=21. Method of the Official Agricultural Chemists for Total Phosphoric\r\nAcid.=—To the hot solution, for every decigram of phosphorus pentoxid\r\nwhich may be present, add fifty cubic centimeters of the molybdic\r\nsolution. Digest at 65° for an hour, filter, and wash with water or\r\nammonium nitrate solution[11]. Test the filtrate by renewed digestion\r\nwith additional molybdate reagent. Dissolve the precipitate on the\r\nfilter with ammonia in hot water and wash into a beaker, making the\r\nvolume of filtrate and washings not more than 100 cubic centimeters.\r\nNearly neutralize with hydrochloric acid, cool, and add magnesia\r\nmixture from a burette at the rate of about one drop a second, stirring\r\nvigorously, meanwhile. The quantity of magnesia mixture to be added is\r\nnot prescribed in the official method but it should always be in excess\r\nof the amount necessary for complete precipitation. For each decigram\r\nof phosphorus pentoxid, from eight to ten cubic centimeters should\r\nbe used. Fifteen minutes after the last of the magnesia mixture has\r\nbeen stirred in, thirty cubic centimeters of ammonia of 0.95 specific\r\ngravity are added and the beaker set aside for two hours or longer. The\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate is separated by filtration, dried, ignited\r\ngently at first, and finally over a blast-lamp and weighed as magnesium\r\npyrophosphate. The factors for calculating the phosphorus pentoxid and\r\ntricalcium phosphate from the weight of pyrophosphate are given below\r\non the two bases; _viz._, hydrogen equals 1, and oxygen equals 16.\r\n\r\n           H = 1.\r\n    Mg₂P₂O₇ × 0.63976 = P₂O₅\r\n    Mg₂P₂O₇ × 1.3964  = Ca₃(PO₄)₂\r\n       P₂O₅ × 2.1827  = Ca₃(PO₄)₂\r\n\r\n           O = 16.\r\n    Mg₂P₂O₇ × 0.63792 = P₂O₅\r\n    Mg₂P₂O₇ × 1.3926  = Ca₃(PO₄)₂\r\n       P₂O₅ × 2.1831  = Ca₃(PO₄)₂\r\n\r\n=22. Preparation of Solutions.=—_Molybdic Solution._—Dissolve 100 grams\r\nof molybdic acid in 400 grams or 417 cubic centimeters of ammonia, of\r\n0.96 specific gravity, and pour the solution thus obtained into 1,500\r\ngrams or 1,250 cubic centimeters of nitric acid, of 1.20 specific\r\ngravity. Keep the mixture in a warm place for several days, or until\r\na portion heated to 40° deposits no yellow precipitate of ammonium\r\nphosphomolybdate. Decant the solution from any sediment and preserve in\r\nglass-stoppered vessels.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia Mixture._—Dissolve twenty-two grams of recently ignited\r\ncalcined magnesia in dilute hydrochloric acid, avoiding an excess of\r\nthe latter. Add a little calcined magnesia in excess, and boil a few\r\nminutes to precipitate iron, alumina, and phosphoric acid; filter, add\r\n280 grams of ammonium chlorid, 700 cubic centimeters of ammonia of\r\nspecific gravity 0.96, and water enough to make a volume of two liters.\r\nInstead of the solution of twenty-two grams of calcined magnesia, 110\r\ngrams of crystallized magnesium chlorid may be used.\r\n\r\n_Dilute Ammonia for Washing._—One volume of ammonia, of 0.96 specific\r\ngravity, mixed with three volumes of water, or usually one volume of\r\nconcentrated ammonia with six volumes of water.\r\n\r\n=23. Use of Tartaric Acid in Phosphoric Acid Estimation.=—In the\r\npresence of iron the molybdate mixture is likely to carry down some\r\nferric oxid with the yellow precipitate. To prevent this, and also\r\nhinder the separation of molybdic acid in the solution on long\r\nstanding, tartaric acid has been recommended.\r\n\r\nJüptner has found that the presence of tartaric acid does not interfere\r\nwith the separation of the yellow precipitate, as some authorities\r\nassert.[12] Even 100 grams of the acid in one liter of molybdate\r\nsolution produce no disturbing effect. Molybdate solution treated\r\nwith tartaric acid did not show any separation of molybdic acid\r\nwhen kept for a year at room temperatures. The presence of tartaric\r\nacid, therefore, is highly recommended by him to prevent the danger\r\nof obtaining both ferric oxid and molybdic acid with the yellow\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\n=24. Water and Organic Matters.=—The sample, according to the practice\r\nof Chatard, should be ground fine enough to leave no residue on an\r\neighty mesh sieve, and should be thoroughly mixed by passing it three\r\ntimes through a forty mesh sieve[13].\r\n\r\nTwo grams are weighed into a tared platinum crucible. This, with\r\nits lid, is placed in an air-bath at 105°, and heated for at least\r\nthree hours. The lid is then put on, and the crucible is placed in\r\na desiccator and weighed as soon as cold. The loss in weight is the\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nWyatt recommends that two grams of the fine material be heated in\r\nground watch-glasses, the edges of which are separated so as to allow\r\nthe escape of the moisture.[14] The heating is continued for three\r\nhours at 110°, the watch-glasses then closed and held by the clip,\r\ncooled in a desiccator, and weighed. This method is excellent for very\r\nhygroscopic bodies, but where quick-acting balances are used, scarcely\r\nnecessary for a powdered mineral.\r\n\r\nThe residue from the moisture determination is gradually heated to\r\nfull redness over a bunsen, and then ignited over the blast-lamp.\r\nThis operation is repeated after weighing until a constant weight is\r\nobtained. The loss (after deducting the percentage of carbon dioxid as\r\nfound in another portion) may be taken as water and organic matter.\r\nThis method is sufficient for all practical purposes; but when minerals\r\ncontaining fluorin are strongly ignited, a part of the fluorin is\r\nexpelled; hence, if more accurate determinations are required, the loss\r\nof fluorin must be taken into account. In this laboratory it has been\r\nproved that a pure calcium fluorid undergoes progressive decomposition\r\nat a bright red heat with formation of lime.\r\n\r\nWyatt directs that the combined water and organic matters be determined\r\nin the residue from the moisture estimation as follows: The residue is\r\nbrushed into a weighed platinum crucible, which is heated over a small\r\nbunsen for ten minutes and then brought to full heat of a blast-lamp\r\nfor five minutes. After cooling, the total loss is determined by\r\nweighing. After deducting the carbon dioxid determined in a separate\r\nportion, the residual loss is regarded as due to combined moisture and\r\norganic matter.\r\n\r\n=25. Carbon Dioxid.=—Many forms of compact apparatus have been devised\r\nfor this estimation, but none of them is satisfactory if accurate\r\nresults are desired.[15] Not to mention other objections, many\r\nphosphates must be heated nearly to the boiling-point with dilute acid\r\nto effect complete decomposition of the carbonates. The distillation\r\nmethod described by Gooch[16] is excellent, and when once the apparatus\r\nis set up, its work will be found to be rapid and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWyatt regards the estimation of carbon dioxid as one of the most\r\nimportant for factory use. The carbonates present in a sample indicate\r\nthe loss of an equivalent amount of acid in the process of conversion\r\ninto superphosphate.[17]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed for estimating carbon dioxid may be any one of\r\nthose in ordinary use for this purpose. The principle of the process\r\ndepends on the liberation of the gas with a mineral acid, its proper\r\ndesiccation, and subsequent absorption by a caustic alkali, best in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of Knorr, described in volume first, page 338, may be\r\nconveniently used. The weight of the sample to be used should be\r\nregulated by the content of carbonate. When this is very high, from\r\none to two grams will be found sufficient; when low, a larger quantity\r\nmust be used. Hydrochloric is preferred as the solvent acid. Those\r\nforms of apparatus which are weighed as a whole and the carbon dioxid\r\ndetermined by reweighing after its expulsion, are not as reliable as\r\nthe absorption apparatus mentioned.\r\n\r\n=26. Soluble and Insoluble Matter.=—Five grams of the fine phosphate\r\nare put into a beaker, twenty-five cubic centimeters of nitric acid,\r\n(specific gravity 1.20) and 12.5 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid (specific gravity 1.12) are added. The beaker, covered with a\r\nwatch-glass, is placed upon the water-bath for thirty minutes[18]. The\r\ncontents of the beaker are well stirred from time to time, and at the\r\nend of the period the beaker is removed from the bath, filled with\r\ncold water, well stirred, and allowed to settle. The solution is next\r\nfiltered into a half liter flask, and the residue is thoroughly washed\r\nwith cold water, partially dried, and then ignited, (finishing with the\r\nblast-lamp) and brought to constant weight. The figures thus obtained\r\nwill, however, be incorrect, because the fluorin liberated during\r\nthe solution of the phosphates dissolves a portion of the silica.\r\nHence, the results are too low. Nevertheless, as the same action would\r\noccur in the manufacture of a superphosphate from the material, the\r\ndetermination may be considered, as a fair approximation to commercial\r\npractice. The ignited residue must be tested for phosphorus pentoxid.\r\n\r\n=27. Preparation of the Solution.=—The flask containing the filtrate\r\nis filled to the mark with cold water, and the solution is thoroughly\r\nmixed by twice pouring into a dry beaker and returning it to the flask.\r\nCold water is used for washing the residue, since if hot water be used,\r\nthe sesquichlorids are apt to become basic and insoluble, and hence to\r\nremain in the residue and on the filter paper. Besides, as the flask\r\nis to be filled to the mark, the contents must be cold before any\r\nvolumetric measurements can be made.\r\n\r\n=28. Silica and Insoluble Bodies.=—Wyatt describes the following method\r\nfor determining the total insoluble or siliceous matters in a mineral\r\nphosphate[19]. Five grams of the fine sample are placed in a porcelain\r\ndish with about thirty cubic centimeters of aqua regia. The dish is\r\ncovered with a funnel, placed on a sand-bath and, after solution is\r\ncomplete, evaporated to dryness with care to prevent sputtering. When\r\ndry the residue is moistened with hydrochloric acid and again dried,\r\nrubbing meanwhile to a fine powder. The heat of the bath is then\r\nincreased to 125° and maintained at this temperature for about ten\r\nminutes. When cool, the residue is treated with fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes. The acid is then diluted and\r\nfiltered on a gooch, which is washed with hot water until the filtrate\r\namounts to a quarter of a liter. The residue in the crucible is dried,\r\nignited, and weighed. This method, unless the solution be subsequently\r\nboiled with nitric acid, may not retain all the phosphoric acid in the\r\northo form.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the total silica by the ordinary methods\r\nof mineral analysis. This is due to the fact that in an acid solution\r\nof a substance containing silicates and fluorids the whole of the\r\nsilica or the fluorin, as the case may be may escape as silicofluorid\r\non evaporation. Again, it is not easy to decompose calcium phosphate\r\nby fusing with sodium carbonate. If an attempt be made to do this,\r\nhowever, the process should be conducted as follows: A portion of the\r\nsample is ground to an impalpable powder in an agate mortar. From one\r\nto two grams of the substance are mixed with five times its weight\r\nof sodium carbonate and fused with the precautions given in standard\r\nworks on quantitative analysis. The fused mass is digested in water,\r\nboiled, and filtered, and the residue washed first with boiling water\r\nand afterwards with ammonium carbonate. The filtrate contains all the\r\nfluorin as sodium fluorid and, in addition to this, sodium carbonate,\r\nsilicate, and aluminate. Mix the filtrate with ammonium carbonate and\r\nheat for some time, replacing the ammonium carbonate which evaporates.\r\nSeparate by filtration the silicic acid hydrate and aluminum hydroxid\r\nwhich are formed and wash them with ammonium carbonate. To separate\r\nthe last portions of silica from the filtrate, add a solution of zinc\r\noxid in ammonia. Evaporate until no more ammonia escapes and separate,\r\nby filtration, the zinc silicate and oxid. Determine the silica in\r\nthis precipitate by dissolving in nitric acid, evaporating to dryness,\r\ntaking up with nitric acid and separating the undissolved silica by\r\nfiltration. In the alkaline filtrate the fluorin may be estimated by\r\nthe usual method as calcium salt.\r\n\r\n=29. Estimation of Lime.=—One hundred cubic centimeters of the solution\r\n(containing one gram of the original substance) are evaporated in a\r\nbeaker to about fifty cubic centimeters; ten cubic centimeters of\r\ndilute sulfuric acid (one to five) are added; and the evaporation is\r\ncontinued on the water-bath until a considerable crop of crystals of\r\ngypsum has formed[20]. The solution is then allowed to cool, when it\r\ngenerally becomes pasty, owing to the separation of additional gypsum.\r\nWhen it is cold, 150 cubic centimeters of ninety-five per cent alcohol\r\nare slowly added, with continual stirring, and the whole is allowed\r\nto stand for three hours, being stirred from time to time. After\r\nthree hours, it is filtered, with the aid of a filter-pump, into a\r\ndistillation flask, and the beautifully crystalline precipitate, which\r\ndoes not adhere to the beaker, is washed with ninety-five per cent\r\nalcohol. The filter, with the precipitate, is gently removed from the\r\nfunnel and inverted into a platinum crucible, so that, by squeezing the\r\npoint of the filter, the precipitate is made to fall into the crucible,\r\nand the paper can be pressed down smoothly upon it. On gentle heating\r\nof the crucible, the remaining alcohol burns off, and when the paper\r\nhas been completely destroyed, the heat is raised to the full power\r\nof a bunsen for about five minutes. After cooling in a desiccator the\r\ncrucible containing the calcium sulfate, is weighed. The filtration may\r\nalso be accomplished on asbestos felt.\r\n\r\n=30. The Ammonium Oxalate Method.=—This method has been extensively\r\nused in this country in commercial work, and is best carried out as\r\ndescribed by Wyatt.[21] The total filtrates from the iron and alumina\r\nprecipitates, secured as described in paragraph =33=, are well mixed\r\nand concentrated to a volume of about 100 cubic centimeters. There\r\nare added about twenty cubic centimeters of a saturated solution of\r\nammonium oxalate, and after stirring, the mixture is allowed to cool\r\nand remain at rest for six hours. The supernatant liquid is poured\r\nthrough a filter, the residue washed three times by decantation with\r\nhot water and brought upon the filter. The beaker and precipitate are\r\nwashed at least three times. The precipitate is dried and ignited at\r\nlow redness for ten minutes. The temperature is then raised by a blast\r\nand the ignition continued for five minutes longer, or until the lime\r\nis obtained as oxid. The precipitate is likely to contain magnesia. The\r\nmagnesia is estimated in the filtrates from the lime determination by\r\nfirst mixing them and concentrating to 100 cubic centimeters, which,\r\nafter cooling, are made strongly alkaline with ammonia. After allowing\r\nto stand for twelve hours the ammonium magnesium phosphate is collected\r\nand reduced to magnesium pyrophosphate by the usual processes. If one\r\ngram of the original material has been used the pyrophosphate obtained,\r\nmultiplied by 0.36, will give the weight of magnesia contained therein.\r\n\r\n=31. Lime Method of Immendorff.=—The tedious processes required\r\nto determine the lime in the presence of iron, alumina, and large\r\nquantities of phosphoric acid are well known to analysts. Immendorff\r\nhas published a method, accompanied by the necessary experimental\r\ndata, based on the comparative insolubility of calcium oxalate in very\r\ndilute solution of hydrochloric acid. He has shown in the data given\r\nthat the lime is all precipitated in the conditions named and that the\r\nprecipitate, when properly prepared, is not contaminated with weighable\r\namounts of the other substances found in the original solution[22].\r\nThe ease with which oxalic acid can be determined volumetrically\r\nwith potassium permanganate solution aids greatly in the time-saving\r\nadvantages of the process.\r\n\r\nIn a hydrochloric acid solution of a mineral phosphate an aliquot\r\npart of the filtrate representing about 250 milligrams of calcium\r\noxid, usually about twenty-five cubic centimeters, should be taken\r\nfor the analysis. Ammonia is added in slight excess and then the acid\r\nreaction restored with hydrochloric until shown plainly by litmus. The\r\nsolution is then heated and the lime thrown down by adding a solution\r\nof ammonium oxalate in excess. In order to secure a greater dilution\r\nof the hydrochloric acid after the precipitation has been made, water\r\nshould be added until the volume is half a liter. Before filtering, the\r\nwhole should be cooled to room temperature. The precipitate should be\r\nwashed first with cold and afterwards with warm water. The well-washed\r\nprecipitate is dissolved in hot dilute sulfuric acid and the solution,\r\nwhile hot, titrated with a standard solution of potassium permanganate\r\nset by a solution of ammonio-ferrous sulfate.\r\n\r\nIf one cubic centimeter of the permanganate represent 0.005 gram of\r\niron it will correspond almost exactly to 0.0035 gram of calcium oxid.\r\n\r\n    _Example._—Sample of rather poor mineral phosphate, five\r\n    grams in half a liter. Strength of potassium permanganate, one\r\n    cubic centimeter equivalent to 0.00697 gram of iron and to\r\n    0.003484 gram of calcium oxid.\r\n\r\n    Twenty-five cubic centimeters of the solution, representing one\r\n    quarter of a gram, in which the lime was precipitated as above\r\n    described, required 9.6 cubic centimeters of the potassium\r\n    permanganate to saturate the oxalic acid. Then\r\n\r\n                   9.6 × 0.003484 = 0.0334464 gram,\r\n\r\n    or 13.38 per cent of calcium oxid. The method is also applicable\r\n    to basic slags.\r\n\r\n=32. Estimation of Iron and Alumina in Mineral Phosphates.=—When\r\nmineral phosphates are to be used for the manufacture of\r\nsuperphosphates by treatment with sulfuric acid their content of\r\niron and alumina becomes a matter of importance. By reason of the\r\npoor drying qualities of the sulfates of these bases their presence\r\nin any considerable excess of a few per cent becomes exceedingly\r\nobjectionable. The accurate estimation of these ingredients is not\r\nonly then a matter of scientific interest but one of great commercial\r\nsignificance to the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe conventional methods so long in use depending on the precipitation\r\nof the iron and alumina as phosphates in the presence of acetic acid\r\nhave been proved to be somewhat unreliable. Not only does the acetic\r\nacid fail to prevent the precipitation of some of the lime, but it\r\nalso dissolves more or less of the iron and aluminum phosphates. The\r\nsolution of the precipitate and its reprecipitation by the addition of\r\nammonia, may free the second precipitate from lime, but it increases\r\nthe error due to the solubility of the aluminum salt. The methods\r\nrecently introduced for the estimation of iron and alumina in presence\r\nof excess of lime and phosphoric acid are not entirely satisfactory,\r\nbut are the best which can now be offered.\r\n\r\n=33. The Acetate Method.=—The principle of this process is based on the\r\nfact that in a solution containing iron, alumina, lime, and phosphoric\r\nacid the iron and aluminum phosphates can be thrown down in a slightly\r\nacid solution by ammonium acetate while the calcium phosphate remains\r\nin solution. The acidity in the older methods is due to acetic and can\r\nbe secured by making the solution slightly alkaline with ammonia and\r\nadding acetic to slight acidity. One of the best methods of conducting\r\nthe operation is that of C. Glaser[23]. Glaser’s modification of the\r\nolder processes is based on the assumption that at 70° the aluminum\r\nphosphate is quantitatively precipitated by ammonium acetate in a\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid solution and that the mixed precipitates of\r\niron and aluminum phosphates obtained at this temperature are free of\r\nlime. The operation is conducted in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid solution of the phosphate must contain no free\r\nchlorin and is treated with a few drops of a methyl orange solution.\r\nAmmonia is added until nearly neutral, but the acid reaction is\r\nretained as shown by the indicator. A few cubic centimeters of ammonium\r\nacetate are added, which produce a yellow coloration of the liquid and\r\nalso a complete precipitation of the iron and aluminum phosphates when\r\nwarmed to 70°. At this temperature the precipitation of any calcium\r\nphosphate is avoided. A small quantity of the lime may be carried down\r\nmechanically and therefore the precipitate should be dissolved in\r\nhydrochloric acid and the precipitation again made as above after the\r\naddition of some sodium phosphate. If the original solution contain\r\nany free chlorin, as may be the case when aqua regia is employed as\r\nsolvent, before beginning the separation, ammonia should be added in\r\nslight excess and the acidity restored by hydrochloric after adding\r\nthe indicator. In washing the precipitates, water of not over 70°\r\nmust be used. As has been shown by Hess in the work cited in the\r\nnext paragraph, the statement of C. Glaser to the effect that the\r\nprecipitates obtained as above are free of lime has not been proved to\r\nbe strictly correct. The process, however, is a distinct improvement\r\nover the older methods and forms the basis of the amended process given\r\nbelow, which appears to be sufficiently accurate to entitle the acetate\r\nmethod to favorable consideration.\r\n\r\n=34. Method of Hess.=—Hess has lately made a thorough investigation of\r\nthe standard methods of determining the iron and aluminum oxids in the\r\npresence of phosphoric acid and has shown that the assumption that the\r\ncomposition of the precipitate is represented by the formula Al₂(PO₄)₂\r\n+ Fe₂(PO₄)₂ is erroneous[24].\r\n\r\nIn the washing of the precipitated iron and aluminum phosphates there\r\nis a progressive decomposition of the compound with the production\r\nof a basic salt. The composition of the precipitate at the end is\r\ndependent chiefly upon the way in which the washing takes place. It\r\nis quite difficult to always secure a washing in exactly the same way\r\nand the final composition of the precipitate varies with almost every\r\ndetermination. It is not, therefore, an accurate proceeding to take\r\nhalf the weight of the precipitate as phosphoric acid or as iron oxid\r\nand alumina. In every case it is necessary to dissolve the precipitate\r\nand determine the phosphoric acid in the regular way. Hess proposes the\r\nfollowing method for carrying out the acetate process of separation:\r\n\r\nThe mineral phosphate should be dissolved in hydrochloric acid and\r\nthe solution made up to such a volume as shall contain in each fifty\r\ncubic centimeters, one gram of the original substance. This quantity\r\nof the solution is diluted with two or three times its volume of\r\nwater to which a drop of methyl orange solution (1-100) is added, and\r\nammonia added with constant stirring until the solution is just colored\r\nand still reacts slightly acid. Without taking any account of the\r\nprecipitate which is produced by this approximate neutralization of\r\nthe solution, there are added fifty cubic centimeters of acid ammonium\r\nacetate which in one liter contains 250 grams of commercial ammonium\r\nacetate. The acidity of the solution is due to an excess of acetic in\r\nthe commercial salt. The temperature is then carried to 70° and the\r\nprecipitate produced immediately separated by filtration, washed four\r\ntimes with water below 70°, and again dissolved in dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid. The dissolved precipitate is treated with ten cubic centimeters\r\nof a ten per cent ammonium phosphate solution and again almost\r\nneutralized as described above, twenty-five cubic centimeters of the\r\nammonium acetate solution added and warmed to 70°.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate obtained is once more dissolved and precipitated as\r\nabove described, and is then collected upon a filter, washed, ignited,\r\nand weighed. The residue after ignition is dissolved in the crucible by\r\nheating with a little concentrated hydrochloric acid, and washed into a\r\nbeaker. Any silicic acid present is separated by filtration, ignited,\r\nand weighed, and subtracted from the total weight of the precipitate.\r\nTo the filtrate is added ammonia to diminish the acidity, but not\r\nsufficient to produce a precipitate and the clear solution is treated\r\nwith thirty cubic centimeters of the ordinary ammoniacal citrate\r\nsolution and fifteen cubic centimeters of magnesium mixture, and the\r\nprecipitation of the ammonium magnesium phosphate hastened by stirring\r\nwith a glass rod.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to always make the filtrate from the third\r\nprecipitation slightly ammoniacal and to boil it for a long time.\r\nIf the operation have been carried on correctly, there occurs only\r\na slight precipitate of Ca₃P₂O₈ amounting only to a few milligrams.\r\nIn some cases it may be necessary to dissolve the precipitate and\r\nreprecipitate the iron and aluminum phosphates a fourth time.\r\n\r\nThe whole time required for the triple precipitation, according to\r\nHess, if all the operations be properly conducted, is from three to\r\nfour hours. It is therefore possible by this variation of the acetate\r\nmethod to secure a determination of the iron and alumina as phosphates\r\nin the same time which is occupied by the Glaser-Jones method when the\r\nseparation of lime is taken into account.\r\n\r\nIf the solution of the mineral phosphate employed contain any notable\r\nquantity of organic material, it must be destroyed by boiling with\r\nbromin or some other oxidation agent, before the precipitation by the\r\nacetate method is commenced.\r\n\r\nThe presence of silicic acid need not be taken into special\r\nconsideration since this can be detected and determined in the\r\nphosphate precipitates after they have been ignited and weighed. While\r\nthe determinations of the phosphoric acid in Hess’ method were made\r\nby precipitation in the presence of citrate, he found that they agree\r\nperfectly with the previous precipitations with molybdic solution.\r\n\r\n=35. Method of Glaser.=—The principle on which this method rests\r\ndepends on the preliminary removal of the lime by conversion into\r\ncalcium sulfate and its precipitation in the presence of strong\r\nalcohol.[25] It is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nFive grams of the phosphate are dissolved in a mixture of twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.2 specific gravity and about 12.5\r\ncubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of 1.12 specific gravity, and\r\nmade up to a volume of half a liter, and filtered. One hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate, equivalent to one gram of the substance,\r\nare placed in a quarter liter flask and twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof sulfuric acid of 1.84 specific gravity added. The flask is allowed\r\nto stand for about five minutes and meanwhile shaken a few times. About\r\n100 cubic centimeters of alcohol of ninety-five per cent are then\r\nadded and the flask filled with alcohol to the mark and well shaken.\r\nA certain degree of concentration takes place and this is compensated\r\nfor by lifting the stopper and filling again with alcohol to the mark\r\nand shaking a second time. After allowing to stand for half an hour\r\nthe contents of the flask are filtered, 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate being equal to four-tenths gram of the substance. This volume,\r\nfiltered, is evaporated in a platinum dish until the alcohol is driven\r\noff. The alcohol-free residue is heated to boiling in a beaker with\r\nabout fifty cubic centimeters of water. Ammonia is added to alkaline\r\nreaction, but in order to avoid strong effervescence it is not added\r\nduring the boiling. The excess of ammonia is evaporated, the flask\r\nallowed to cool, the contents filtered, precipitate and filter washed\r\nwith warm water, ignited, and the phosphates of iron and alumina\r\nweighed. Half of the weight of the precipitate represents the weight of\r\nFe₂O₃ + Al₂O₃. The estimation, as before indicated, should be carried\r\non without delay, the whole time required not exceeding from one and a\r\nhalf to two hours.\r\n\r\n=36. Jones’ Variation.=—The method of Glaser described above, as\r\npracticed by the German chemists, has been found by Jones to be\r\ninaccurate on account of the alcohol not being added in sufficient\r\nquantity in the precipitation of calcium sulfate and for the additional\r\nreason that the amount of sulfuric acid added is more than is actually\r\nnecessary[26]. Jones modifies the method as follows: Ten grams of the\r\nmaterial are dissolved in nitro-hydrochloric acid and the solution made\r\nup to 500 cubic centimeters and filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthis solution, representing one gram, are evaporated to twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters and, while still hot, ten cubic centimeters of dilute\r\nsulfuric acid (one to five) added. The mixture is then well stirred and\r\ncooled. One hundred and fifty cubic centimeters of ninety-five per cent\r\nalcohol are next added and after stirring, the solution is allowed to\r\nstand three hours. The calcium sulfate is collected on a filter, washed\r\nwith alcohol, and the filtrate and washings collected in an erlenmeyer.\r\nThe washing is completed when the last ten drops, after dilution with\r\nan equal volume of water, are not colored with a drop of methyl orange.\r\n\r\nThe moist calcium sulfate is transferred to a platinum crucible, the\r\nfilter placed on it, the alcohol burned off, the filter incinerated,\r\nand the calcium sulfate ignited and weighed. The contents of the flask\r\nare heated to expel the alcohol, the residue washed into a beaker, made\r\nslightly alkaline with ammonia, and again heated till all the ammonia\r\nis driven off. This treatment is necessary to prevent the precipitate\r\nfrom being contaminated with magnesia. The precipitate is collected\r\non a filter, washed four times with hot water, or water containing\r\nammonium nitrate, dried, ignited, and weighed. One-half of the weight\r\nof the precipitate represents the weight of the ferric and aluminic\r\noxids.\r\n\r\n=37. Estimation of Iron and Alumina in Phosphates by Crispo’s\r\nMethod.=—The phosphate of ferric iron is subject to a slight\r\ndecomposition in presence of both hot and cold water with a tendency\r\nto the production of basic compounds. It is soluble to a slight extent\r\nin hot and cold acetic acid, almost insoluble in ammonium acetate, and\r\nquite insoluble in ammonium chlorid and nitrate. Aluminum phosphate\r\nis likewise soluble, to a slight degree, in acetic acid and ammonium\r\nacetate, and insoluble in ammonium chlorid and nitrate. The method of\r\nCrispo for the separation of iron and alumina in phosphates is based\r\non the above properties.[27] Five grams of the mineral phosphate are\r\ndissolved in fifty cubic centimeters of aqua regia, composed of forty\r\ncubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of 1.10, and ten of nitric acid\r\nof 1.20 specific gravity, and this solution is diluted to half a liter.\r\nTo fifty cubic centimeters of the filtered solution are added two of\r\nammonia (0.96) and fifty of a half saturated solution of ammonium\r\nchlorid, and the whole boiled. The liquid should remain clear, but if\r\nit become cloudy add a little dilute nitric acid, drop by drop, until\r\nthe turbidity is removed, and then ten cubic centimeters of a saturated\r\nsolution of ammonium acetate, and boil for three minutes, cool, and\r\nfilter. The precipitate is washed twice with a ten per cent solution of\r\nammonium chlorid and redissolved with two cubic centimeters of nitric\r\nacid, and the filter washed with hot water. The phosphoric acid is\r\nseparated by forty cubic centimeters of molybdate solution, and the\r\nprecipitate washed three or four times with a one per cent nitric acid\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nTo the filtrate are added fifty cubic centimeters of a one-half\r\nsaturated ammonium chlorid solution, ammonia is added in slight excess\r\nto produce precipitation and the mixture boiled for a few minutes.\r\nAfter filtering, the precipitate is washed with hot water three or\r\nfour times, dissolved in two cubic centimeters of nitric acid, and the\r\nfilter washed with hot water. Again, fifty cubic centimeters of half\r\nsaturated ammonium chlorid are added and the precipitate thrown down\r\nonce more by ammonia in slight excess. The precipitate is washed with\r\nhot water and finally ignited and weighed as iron and aluminum oxids.\r\n\r\nAccording to Crispo, the original Glaser method, with its various\r\nmodifications, is not to be considered reliable, and the choice lies\r\nbetween the molybdic method as usually practiced, and his own for\r\nthe accurate estimation of iron and alumina. Manganese disturbs the\r\naccuracy of the results unless the directions given are carefully\r\nfollowed. Manganese phosphate is soluble at all temperatures below\r\nfifty. If then the mixture of the phosphates be allowed to cool before\r\nfiltering, the iron and aluminum salts are not contaminated with\r\nmanganese. This method of Crispo is somewhat tedious, but it is claimed\r\nthat these variations of the molybdic method render it exact in respect\r\nof the determination of iron and alumina.\r\n\r\n=38. Method Employed in Geological Survey.=—Chatard gives the\r\nfollowing directions for conducting the Glaser-Jones process[28]: The\r\ndistillation flask containing the alcoholic filtrate is connected with\r\nits condenser and heated on a water-bath until no more alcohol comes\r\nover. This distillate, if mixed with a little sodium carbonate and\r\nredistilled over quicklime, can be used over and over again, so that\r\nthe expense for alcohol is really very slight, while in the use of the\r\nGlaser method, with its large amount of sulfuric acid, all the alcohol\r\nis lost.\r\n\r\nWhen the distillation is ended the residue in the flask is washed into\r\na platinum dish and evaporated to a small bulk on the water-bath. The\r\ndark brown color produced is due to the presence of organic matter and\r\nthis must be destroyed, as it prevents the complete precipitation of\r\nthe phosphate in the subsequent operation.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter is best destroyed by removing the dish from the\r\nbath, adding a small quantity of pure sodium nitrate, and heating very\r\ncarefully over the naked flame, keeping the dish well covered with\r\na watch-glass to avoid spattering. The mass fuses to a colorless,\r\nviscous liquid, becoming glassy when cooled and is readily soluble in\r\na hot very dilute solution of nitric acid. The solution transferred\r\nto a beaker is made distinctly alkaline with ammonia and carefully\r\nneutralized with acetic acid, diluted with hot water, boiled, and\r\nthe precipitate allowed to settle, after which it is separated by\r\nfiltration.\r\n\r\nAfter the precipitate has been completely transferred to the filter,\r\nthe washing is completed with a dilute solution of ammonium nitrate.\r\nThe precipitate is dried, ignited, cooled, and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe determinations should be made in pairs, one portion being used\r\nfor the estimation of the phosphoric acid by fusing with a little\r\nsodium carbonate, and the other, after fusion with sodium carbonate,\r\nis dissolved with sulfuric acid and the iron reduced and titrated with\r\npotassium permanganate solution. The filtrate from the iron and alumina\r\ndetermination is evaporated to a small bulk, made strongly ammoniacal\r\nand allowed to stand for some time when the magnesia present separates\r\nas ammonium magnesium phosphate which is determined in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf, during the evaporation of the filtrate, any flocculent matter\r\nseparate, it should be removed by filtration and examined before\r\nprecipitating the magnesia.\r\n\r\n=39. Variation of Marioni and Fasselli.=—Glaser’s method has been shown\r\nto be subject to errors by Marioni and Fasselli[29] in the following\r\nrespects:\r\n\r\n1. The precipitation of a small quantity of calcium phosphate with the\r\nferric and aluminum phosphates.\r\n\r\n2. The possible precipitation of basic phosphates if all the iron and\r\nalumina are not combined with phosphoric acid in the mineral.\r\n\r\n3. The partial solubility of ferric and aluminum phosphates in dilute\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\n4. The decomposition of ferric orthophosphate into soluble acid\r\nphosphate and insoluble basic salt by boiling.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these errors the following procedure is proposed: From one to\r\nfive grams of the phosphate are boiled in a flask for ten minutes with\r\nfifteen cubic centimeters of strong hydrochloric acid, and afterwards\r\ndiluted with a double volume of water. A few crystals of potassium\r\nchlorate are added, and several drops of nitric acid, and the liquid\r\nboiled to expel chlorin. It is then filtered and washed until the\r\nvolume of the filtered liquid amounts to 150 cubic centimeters. After\r\ncooling, a half gram of ammonium phosphate in solution is added, and\r\ntwo cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid, followed by dilute\r\nammonia, drop by drop, until a slight precipitate persists on stirring.\r\nAgain the same quantity of acetic acid is added as above, well shaken,\r\nand left for two hours. The precipitate is collected on a filter and\r\nwashed with a one per cent ammonium phosphate solution. The precipitate\r\nis dissolved by a minimum quantity of hydrochloric acid and the\r\nsolution collected in the same vessel in which the precipitation took\r\nplace. A second precipitation is conducted just as described above.\r\nThe precipitate is washed as above described and ignited at a dull red\r\nheat. Half the weight obtained represents the ferric oxid and alumina.\r\n\r\n=40. Method of Ogilvie.=—For the separation of alumina from phosphoric\r\nacid Ogilvie recommends that the filtrate from the phosphomolybdate\r\nprecipitate be neutralized with ammonia, the precipitate thus formed\r\nredissolved in nitric acid, again precipitated with ammonia, filtered,\r\nignited, and weighed as aluminum oxid.[30] If iron be present it will,\r\nof course, appear in the product. For use in the examination of mineral\r\nphosphates the method can not have a wide application without amendment.\r\n\r\n=41. Method of Krug and McElroy.=—Krug and McElroy show that when\r\nsufficient alcohol is added to precipitate all of the calcium sulfate\r\nin the Glaser method, it will also cause a precipitation of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of iron, by means of which the calcium sulfate\r\nwill be colored.[31] The presence of potassium and ammonium salts also\r\naffects very notably the precipitation of calcium. The method employed\r\nby them, in order to avoid these sources of error, is as follows:\r\n\r\nOne hundred cubic centimeters, equivalent to one gram of the substance,\r\nin a nitric acid solution, are placed in a half liter flask and a\r\nsolution of ammonium molybdate added until all the phosphoric acid\r\nhas been precipitated. The addition of ammonium nitrate will hasten\r\nthe separation of the ammonium phosphomolybdate. The liquid should be\r\nallowed to stand for twelve hours. The flask is then filled to the\r\nmark, the contents well shaken, filtered through a dry filter, and\r\nduplicate samples of 200 cubic centimeters each of the filtrate taken\r\nfor analysis.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of ammonium nitrate is dissolved in the liquid, and\r\nammonia cautiously added, keeping the solution as cool as possible. The\r\niron and alumina are precipitated as hydroxids. The mixed hydroxids are\r\ncollected on a filter, washed with water, the filtrate and washings\r\nbeing collected in a beaker. The precipitate should be dissolved with a\r\nsmall quantity of a solution of ammonium nitrate and nitric acid, again\r\nprecipitated with ammonia, filtered, washed, ignited, and weighed. This\r\ntreatment is for the purpose of excluding all possibility of error from\r\nthe presence of molybdic anhydrid. After weighing, the mixed oxids\r\nshould be fused with sodium bisulfate, the magma dissolved in water,\r\nand the iron determined volumetrically with potassium permanganate\r\nafter reduction to the ferrous state.\r\n\r\nMcElroy has further shown by experiments in this laboratory that even\r\nthe molybdate method of separating the iron and alumina from phosphoric\r\nacid with the improvements as first suggested by Krug and himself, may\r\nnot always give reliable results.[32] In a solution containing ferrous\r\niron equivalent to 56.4 milligrams of ferric oxid, were placed enough\r\nof a solution of sodium phosphate to correspond to 100 milligrams of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid. The precipitate was dissolved by adding nitric\r\nacid, oxidized with bromin water, and the phosphoric acid thrown out\r\nwith ammonium molybdate. The precipitate was washed with weak nitric\r\nacid and the combined filtrate and washings neutralized with ammonia.\r\nThe resultant precipitate was dissolved in a solution of ammonium\r\nnitrate and nitric acid, filtered, and again precipitated with ammonia.\r\nIn two instances the quantities of material recovered after ignition\r\nwere 56.9 and 57.3 milligrams, respectively, instead of the theoretical\r\namount, _viz._, 56.4 milligrams.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was repeated after the addition of 400 milligrams of\r\ncalcium oxid the weight of the precipitate recovered was 62.3 and\r\n63.1 milligrams in duplicate determinations. Similar determinations\r\nwere made with a known weight, _viz._, 35.6 milligrams of alumina.\r\nThe treatment of the mixture was precisely as indicated above for\r\niron. The quantity of alumina finally obtained was 28.9 and 29.3\r\nmilligrams, respectively, in duplicate determinations. When the lime\r\nwas added, however, the weights of alumina, recovered, fell to 19.8 and\r\n20.6 milligrams, respectively. These results show that the molybdate\r\nmethod for the separation of iron and alumina in the presence of a\r\nlarge excess of lime and phosphoric acid is subject to widely varying\r\nresults, but that the error due to the excess of iron in the weighed\r\nproduct is partly corrected by the one due to deficiency of alumina.\r\n\r\n=42. Method of Wyatt.=—A method largely used in this country, both in\r\nprivate laboratories and by fertilizer factories, for determining iron\r\nand alumina, is described by Wyatt[33]. It is claimed for this method\r\nthat, while it may not be strictly accurate, yet it is rapid and easy,\r\nand in the hands of trained analysts yields concordant results. Fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of the first solution of the sample in aqua regia, or\r\nan amount thereof equivalent to one gram of the phosphate, in a beaker,\r\nare rendered alkaline by ammonia. The resulting precipitate is first\r\nredissolved by hydrochloric acid, and a slight alkalinity is again\r\nproduced with ammonia. Fifty cubic centimeters of strong acetic acid\r\nare next added, the mixture stirred and placed in a cool place and left\r\nuntil cold. The precipitate is then separated by filtration and washed\r\ntwice with boiling water. The vessel holding the filtrate is replaced\r\nby the beaker in which the precipitation was made. The precipitate\r\nis dissolved in a little fifty per cent hot hydrochloric acid and\r\nthe filter washed with hot water. After rendering slightly alkaline,\r\nas in the first instance, the treatment with acetic acid is repeated\r\nas described. The precipitate is washed this time, twice with cold\r\nwater containing a little acetic acid and three times with hot water.\r\nThe precipitate is dried, ignited, and weighed as iron and aluminum\r\nphosphate. Half of this weight may be taken to represent the quantity\r\nof iron and aluminum oxids.\r\n\r\nTo separate the iron and alumina the precipitate just described\r\nis dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid, filtered into a 100 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask, and made up to the mark by hot wash-water.\r\n\r\nThe phosphoric acid is determined in one-half of the filtrate and in\r\nthe remaining half the iron is reduced with zinc and determined with\r\npotassium permanganate in the usual way. The phosphoric acid and iron\r\nhaving been thus determined the alumina is estimated by difference. The\r\nchief objection to this process is in the excessive quantity of acetic\r\nacid used and the danger of solution of the precipitated phosphates\r\ncaused thereby.\r\n\r\n=43. Estimation of the Lime and Magnesia.=—The filtrate and washings\r\nfrom the first precipitation, (paragraph =41=,) of iron and alumina\r\nin the method of Krug and McElroy, above described, are collected and\r\nsufficient ammonium oxalate is added to precipitate the calcium. The\r\nprecipitated calcium is very fine and should be collected on a gooch,\r\nunder pressure. The filtrate and washings from the calcium precipitate\r\nare again collected, and a solution of sodium phosphate added to\r\nprecipitate the magnesia. The solution must be kept cool and slightly\r\nalkaline with ammonia during the above operations in order to prevent\r\nthe separation of molybdic anhydrid.\r\n\r\n=44. Estimation of Sulfuric Acid.=—As a rule, sulfates are not abundant\r\nin mineral phosphates. In case the samples are pyritiferous, however,\r\nconsiderable quantities of sulfuric acid may be found after treatment\r\nwith aqua regia.\r\n\r\nThe acid is precipitated with barium chlorid, in the usual way, in an\r\naliquot portion of the filtrate first obtained. The precipitate of\r\nbarium sulfate is washed with hot water until clean, dried, ignited,\r\nand weighed. If the portion of the filtrate taken represent half a gram\r\nof the original material then the weight of barium sulfate obtained\r\nmultiplied by 0.6858 will give the quantity of sulfur trioxid in one\r\ngram.\r\n\r\n=45. Estimation of Fluorin by the Method of Berzelius as Modified by\r\nChatard.=—The method of estimating fluorin as proposed by Berzelius,\r\nhas been found quite satisfactory in the laboratory of the Geological\r\nSurvey, with the modifications given below.[34]\r\n\r\nTwo grams of the phosphate are intimately mixed in a large platinum\r\ncrucible with three grams of precipitated silica and twelve grams of\r\npure sodium carbonate, and the mixture is gradually brought to clear\r\nfusion over the blast-lamp. When the fusion is complete the melt is\r\nspread over the walls of the crucible, which is then rapidly cooled\r\n(preferably by a blast of air). If this have been properly done, the\r\nmass separates easily from the crucible, and the subsequent leaching is\r\nhastened. The mass, detached from the crucible, is put into a platinum\r\ndish into which whatever remains adhering to the crucible, or its lid,\r\nis also washed with hot water. A reasonable amount of hot water is now\r\nput into the dish, which is covered and digested on the water-bath\r\nuntil the mass is thoroughly disintegrated. To hasten this, the\r\nsupernatant liquid may, after awhile, be poured off, the residue being\r\nwashed into a small porcelain mortar, ground up, returned to the dish\r\nand boiled with fresh water until no hard grains are left. The total\r\nliquid is then filtered, and the residue is washed with hot water.\r\nThe filtrate (which should amount to about half a liter) is nearly\r\nneutralized with nitric acid (methyl orange being used as indicator),\r\nsome pure sodium bicarbonate is at once added, and the solution (in\r\na platinum dish, if one large enough is at disposal, otherwise in a\r\nbeaker) is placed on the water-bath, when it speedily becomes turbid\r\nthrough separation of silica. As soon as the solution is warm it is\r\nremoved from the bath, stirred, allowed to stand for two or three\r\nhours, and then filtered by means of the filter-pump and washed with\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate is concentrated to about a quarter of a liter and nearly\r\nneutralized, as before, some sodium carbonate is added, and the\r\nphosphoric acid is precipitated with silver nitrate in excess. The\r\nprecipitate is separated by filtration and washed with hot water, and\r\nthe excess of silver in the filtrate is removed with sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate from the silver chlorid (after addition of some sodium\r\nbicarbonate) is evaporated to its crystallizing point, then cooled and\r\ndiluted with cold water; still more sodium bicarbonate is added, and\r\nthe whole is allowed to stand, when additional silica will separate,\r\nand this is to be removed by filtration.\r\n\r\nThis final solution is nearly neutralized, as before; a little sodium\r\ncarbonate solution is added; it is heated to boiling and an excess\r\nof solution of calcium chlorid is added. The precipitate of calcium\r\nfluorid and carbonate must be boiled for a few minutes, when it can\r\nbe easily filtered and washed with hot water. The precipitate is then\r\nwashed from the filter into a small platinum dish and evaporated to\r\ndryness, while the filter, after being partially dried and used to wipe\r\noff any particles of the precipitate adhering to the dish in which it\r\nwas formed, is burned, and the ash is added to the main precipitate.\r\nThis, when dry, is ignited, and allowed to cool; dilute acetic acid is\r\nadded in excess, and the whole is evaporated to dryness, being kept\r\non the water-bath until all odor of acetic acid has disappeared. The\r\nresidue is then treated with hot water, digested, filtered on a small\r\nfilter, washed with hot water, partially dried, put into a crucible,\r\ncarefully ignited, and weighed as calcium fluorid. The calcium fluorid\r\nis then dissolved in sulfuric acid by gentle heating and agitation,\r\nevaporated to dryness on a radiator, ignited at full red heat, and\r\nweighed as calcium sulfate. From this weight the equivalent weight of\r\ncalcium fluorid should be calculated, and this should be very close\r\nto that actually found as above, but should never exceed it. The\r\ndifference, which is generally about a milligram (sometimes more), is\r\ndue to silica precipitated with the fluorid. The percentage of fluorin\r\nis, therefore, always calculated from the weight of the sulfate, and\r\nnot from that of the fluorid obtained.\r\n\r\nThe main improvements in this method are the use of sodium bicarbonate\r\nto separate the silica, and the keeping of the earlier solutions as\r\ndilute as possible, which can not be done, if ammonium carbonate be\r\nused for the separation of the silica. These changes make the fluorin\r\nestimation, although still tedious, far more rapid than before, and the\r\nresults are very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=46. Modification of Wyatt.=—By reason of the tediousness of the method\r\nof Chatard given above, Wyatt has sought to shorten the process by the\r\nfollowing modification:[35]\r\n\r\nFive grams of the finely ground phosphate are fused in a platinum dish\r\nwith fifteen grams of the mixed carbonates of sodium and potassium and\r\nthree grams of fine sand. After fusing very thoroughly with a strong\r\nheat for a quarter of an hour, the dish is removed from the fire and\r\ncooled. Its contents, dissolved in hot water, are then put into a half\r\nliter flask, and a considerable excess of ammonium carbonate is added\r\nto the liquid. All the soluble silica falls out of solution, and the\r\nflask, after cooling, is made up to the mark with distilled water, well\r\nshaken, and then set aside for twenty-four hours to settle. At the\r\nend of this time 200 cubic centimeters are carefully decanted through\r\na filter; the filter is well washed, and the filtrate, after being\r\nnearly neutralized with hydrochloric acid, is treated with an excess of\r\ncalcium chlorid solution.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate, consisting of phosphate, fluorid, and some calcium\r\ncarbonate, is allowed to settle, and is then carefully washed with\r\nboiling water, first by decantation several times, and finally on\r\nthe filter. After being properly dried in the gas-oven, calcined,\r\nand cooled, the residue is treated with acetic acid, placed upon the\r\nwater-bath, and evaporated to complete dryness.\r\n\r\nThe calcium acetate is now well washed out by several treatments\r\nwith boiling water, and the residue is brought upon a filter, dried,\r\ncalcined, and weighed. The weight represents the calcium phosphate\r\nand fluorid contained in two grams of the original sample; and if\r\nthe calcium phosphate in the residue be determined, according to the\r\nusual methods, the difference will be calcium fluorid and may be thus\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Assuming the calcined residue of calcium phosphate and\r\nfluorid in two grains of the original sample to have amounted to one\r\nand six-tenths gram and the calcium phosphate in this quantity to have\r\nbeen determined as 1.540 gram, the calcium fluorid is thus proved to\r\nbe 0.060 gram, and, therefore, 2: 0.60::100: x = 3 per cent calcium\r\nfluorid which, multiplied by 0.4897, gives 1.46 per cent of fluorin.\r\n\r\nThe above method, while shorter, is not to be preferred to the Chatard\r\nprocess when great accuracy is desired. All the soluble silica may\r\nnot fall out of the solution as Wyatt says. Finally the fluorin\r\nis calculated from small differences in the weight of very heavy\r\nprecipitates and all the error of the process may be found affecting\r\nthe numbers for fluorin. For commercial purposes, however, the method\r\nis to be recommended for its comparative brevity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL METHODS FOR ESTIMATING PHOSPHORIC ACID IN FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n=47. Preliminary Considerations.=—The chief sources of the phosphoric\r\nacid in commercial fertilizers are the mineral phosphates and bones. In\r\nrespect of the analyses of mineral phosphates detailed directions have\r\nbeen given in the preceding pages. Bones are valuable for fertilizing\r\nmaterials, both because of their content of phosphoric acid and of\r\ntheir organic nitrogen. The methods of treating bones for their\r\nphosphoric acid will be found in the general methods for fertilizing\r\nmaterials, and their nitrogen content can be determined by the\r\nprocesses to be described hereafter. Other fertilizing materials also\r\ncontain phosphorus, as ashes, tankage, oil cakes, and other organic\r\nproducts. In general, the methods for determining the phosphoric acid\r\nis the same in all cases, but the means of destroying the organic\r\nmatter precedent to the analysis vary in different cases. In most cases\r\na simple ignition is sufficient, while, if the phosphorus be found\r\nin certain organic products, the oxidation must be accomplished by\r\none of the methods described in the processes adopted by the official\r\nchemists, or by the means described in volume first, paragraph =378=\r\nor =382=. In all cases of acid phosphates and superphosphates, the\r\nwater and ammonium citrate soluble phosphoric acid is to be determined\r\nas well as the total. In basic slags the amount soluble in ammonium\r\ncitrate or dilute citric acid is also to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where soluble or so-called reverted acid is to be\r\nconsidered, the analysis must be performed without previous desiccation\r\nor ignition. If water content or loss on ignition are to be considered,\r\nthe operation to determine them must be conducted on a separate part of\r\nthe sample.\r\n\r\nThe methods of analysis which have been adopted by associations of\r\nchemists should be given the preference in the conduct of the work,\r\nalthough it must be admitted that they may contain sources of error,\r\nand may be in no respect superior to processes employed by chemists\r\nin their private capacity. In this country the methods adopted by\r\nthe Association of Official Agricultural Chemists should be followed\r\nas closely as possible. The great merit of other methods, however,\r\nmust not be denied. Especially those methods which shorten the time\r\nrequired or diminish the labor and expense of the analysis are worthy\r\nof careful consideration. In factory work, for instance, it is often\r\nfar more important for the chemist to be able to rapidly determine the\r\nphosphoric acid in a great number of samples with approximate accuracy\r\nthan to confine his work to one with absolute precision. Some of the\r\nshorter methods, moreover, notably the citrate process, appear to be\r\nquite, if not altogether, as reliable as the molybdate method, while in\r\nthe case of the uranium volumetric process, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat it is almost the only one practiced in France. Other volumetric\r\nprocesses are given in full, as, for instance, the one perfected\r\nby Pemberton, but data are still lacking to justify their strong\r\nrecommendation. It should be remembered that this manual is not written\r\nfor the beginner but rather for the chemist already acquainted with\r\nthe principles and practice of general chemical analysis, and it is,\r\ntherefore, expected that each analyst will make intelligent use of the\r\ndata placed at his disposal.\r\n\r\n=48. Determination of Phosphoric Acid with Preliminary Precipitation\r\nas Stannic Phosphate.=—This method, once much in use and highly\r\nrecommended, is now almost unknown among the processes of fertilizer\r\ncontrol. It was first proposed and described by Girard, and rests on\r\nthe precipitation of the phosphoric acid in a nitric acid solution by\r\nmeans of metallic tin.[36] The stannic acid formed by the oxidation\r\nof the tin unites with the phosphoric acid held in a free state by\r\nthe nitric acid. The precipitation of the phosphoric acid is said to\r\nbe complete, but a trace of it has been found in the iron and alumina\r\nsubsequently separated from the solution. The precipitate obtained is\r\ndissolved in caustic potash, whereby soluble potassium metastannate\r\nand phosphate are obtained. Following is the method of conducting the\r\nanalysis as described by Crookes:[37]\r\n\r\nThe phosphate should be dissolved in nitric acid, and any chlorin\r\npresent be expelled by repeated evaporations with the solvent. Finally,\r\nto the evaporated mass the strongest nitric acid is added. Pure\r\ntin-foil is added and heat applied. The phosphoric acid is precipitated\r\nby the stannic acid formed. The quantity of tin used should be from six\r\nto eight times as great as that of the phosphoric acid present.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate is collected on a filter, washed, and dissolved in\r\ncaustic potash. The solution is saturated with hydrogen sulfid, and\r\non adding acetic acid in slight excess the tin sulfid is separated\r\nand removed by filtration. The whole of the phosphoric acid, supposed\r\nto be almost free of tin, is now found in the filtrate. The filtrate\r\nis concentrated to small bulk and any tin sulfid present separated by\r\nfiltering, and the phosphoric acid finally removed from the ammoniacal\r\nfiltrate by precipitation with magnesia mixture. The chief difficulties\r\nof this method are to be found, on the one hand, in the retention\r\nof some of the phosphoric acid by the iron and alumina which may be\r\npresent, and on the other, in the presence of some tin in the final\r\nmagnesium pyrophosphate. If the tin be all removed as sulfid, the\r\nlatter source of error will be avoided. It is difficult to secure pure\r\nmetallic tin, and this is another disturbing element in the process.\r\nIt can not be recommended for the work which agricultural analysts are\r\nusually called on to perform.[38]\r\n\r\n=49. Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=—The method of procedure\r\nrecommended by the Association of Official Chemists is as follows:[39]\r\nPlace two grams of the sample in a nine centimeter filter; wash with\r\nsuccessive small portions of cold water, allowing each portion to pass\r\nthrough before adding more, until the filtrate measures about 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters. If the filtrate be turbid, add a little nitric acid. Make\r\nup to any convenient definite volume; mix well; take any convenient\r\nportion and proceed as under total phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n=50. Citrate-Insoluble Phosphoric Acid.=—Heat 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nstrictly neutral ammonium citrate solution of 1.09 specific gravity\r\nto 65° in a flask placed in a bath of warm water, keeping the flask\r\nloosely stoppered to prevent evaporation. When the citrate solution\r\nin the flask has reached 65°, drop into it the filter containing the\r\nwashed residue from the water-soluble phosphoric acid determination,\r\nclose tightly with a smooth rubber stopper, and shake violently until\r\nthe filter paper is reduced to a pulp. Place the flask back into the\r\nbath and maintain the water in the bath at such a temperature that the\r\ncontents of the flask will stand at exactly 65°. Shake the flask every\r\nfive minutes. At the expiration of exactly thirty minutes from the time\r\nthe filter and residue were introduced, remove the flask from the bath\r\nand immediately filter as rapidly as possible. It has been shown by\r\nSanborn, in this laboratory, that the filtration is greatly facilitated\r\nby adding asbestos pulp. Wash thoroughly with water at 65°. Transfer\r\nthe filter and its contents to a crucible, ignite until all organic\r\nmatter is destroyed, add from ten to fifteen cubic centimeters of\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid, and digest until all phosphate is dissolved;\r\nor return the filter with contents to the digestion flask, add from\r\nthirty to thirty-five cubic centimeters of strong nitric, and from\r\nfive to ten cubic centimeters of strong hydrochloric acid, and boil\r\nuntil all the phosphate is dissolved. Dilute the solution to 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters. If desired, the filter and its contents can be treated\r\naccording to methods (1), (2), or (3), under total phosphoric acid.\r\nMix well; filter through a dry filter; take a definite portion of the\r\nfiltrate and proceed as under total phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn case a determination of citrate-insoluble phosphoric acid be\r\nrequired in non-acidulated goods it is to be made by treating two\r\ngrams of the phosphatic material, without previous washing with water,\r\nprecisely in the way above described, except that in case the substance\r\ncontain much animal matter (bone, fish, etc.), the residue insoluble\r\nin ammonium citrate is to be treated by one of the processes described\r\nbelow under total phosphoric acid, (1), (2), or (3).\r\n\r\n=51. Total Phosphoric Acid.=—In case of ignition the residual material\r\nis to be dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The following methods of\r\ntreating the raw material, using two grams in each case, may be\r\nemployed: (1) Evaporate with five cubic centimeters of magnesium\r\nnitrate, ignite, and dissolve in hydrochloric acid. (2) Boil in a\r\nKjeldahl flask graduated to 250 cubic centimeters, with from twenty\r\nto thirty cubic centimeters of strong sulfuric acid, adding from two\r\nto four grams of sodium or potassium nitrate at the beginning of the\r\ndigestion and a small quantity after the solution has become nearly\r\ncolorless; or adding the nitrate in small portions from time to time.\r\nAfter the solution is colorless, add 150 cubic centimeters of water and\r\nboil for a few minutes, cool, and make up to volume. (3) Digest with\r\nstrong sulfuric acid and such other reagents as are used in either the\r\nplain or modified Kjeldahl or Gunning methods for estimating nitrogen.\r\nDo not add any potassium permanganate, but after the solution has\r\nbecome colorless add about 100 cubic centimeters of water and boil\r\nfor a few minutes, cool, and make up to a convenient volume; two\r\nand five-tenths grams of substance and a digestion flask graduated\r\nto 250 cubic centimeters are recommended. This method will be found\r\nconvenient when both the nitrogen and the total phosphoric acid are to\r\nbe determined in a fertilizer. In this case, after diluting the volume\r\nand mixing, a part for the estimation of nitrogen, may be removed with\r\na pipette and the remainder then filtered through a dry filter and a\r\nportion taken for the determination of the total phosphoric acid. (4)\r\nDissolve in thirty cubic centimeters of concentrated nitric acid and a\r\nsmall quantity of hydrochloric acid. (5) Add thirty cubic centimeters\r\nof concentrated hydrochloric acid, heat, and add cautiously, in small\r\nquantities at a time, about five-tenths gram of finely-pulverized\r\npotassium chlorate. (6) Dissolve in from fifteen to thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of strong hydrochloric and from three to ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid. This method is recommended for fertilizers\r\ncontaining much iron or aluminum phosphate. Boil until all phosphates\r\nare dissolved and all organic matter is destroyed; cool and dilute\r\nto 200 or 250 cubic centimeters; mix and pass through a dry filter;\r\ntake an aliquot part of the filtrate corresponding to a quarter, half,\r\nor one gram, neutralize with ammonia, and clear with a few drops of\r\nnitric acid. In case hydrochloric or sulfuric acid have been used as a\r\nsolvent, add about fifteen grams of dry ammonium nitrate.\r\n\r\nTo the hot solutions, for every decigram of phosphorus pentoxid that is\r\npresent, add fifty cubic centimeters of molybdic solution. Digest at\r\nabout 65° for an hour, filter, and wash with water or ammonium nitrate\r\nsolution. Test the filtrate by renewed digestion and the addition of\r\nmore molybdic solution. Dissolve the precipitate on the filter with\r\nammonia and hot water and wash into a beaker to a bulk of not more than\r\n100 cubic centimeters. Nearly neutralize with hydrochloric acid, cool,\r\nand add magnesia mixture from a burette; add slowly (about one drop per\r\nsecond), stirring vigorously. After fifteen minutes add thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia solution of 0.95 density. Let stand for some\r\ntime; two hours are usually enough. Filter, wash with dilute ammonia,\r\nignite gently at first and then at white heat for ten minutes, and\r\nweigh. For the quantity of magnesia mixture to be added see paragraph\r\n=21=.\r\n\r\n=52. Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=—The sum of the water-soluble and\r\ncitrate-insoluble subtracted from the total gives the citrate-soluble\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n=53. Preparation of Reagents.=—(1) _Ammonium Citrate Solution._—(_a_)\r\nMix 370 grams of commercial citric acid with 1,500 cubic centimeters\r\nof water, nearly neutralize with commercial ammonia, cool, add ammonia\r\nuntil exactly neutral (testing with saturated alcoholic solution of\r\ncorallin) and bring to a volume of two liters. Test the specific\r\ngravity, which should be 1.09 at 20°, before using.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Alternate Method._—To 370 grams of commercial citric acid add\r\ncommercial ammonia, of 0.96 specific gravity, until nearly neutral;\r\nreduce the specific gravity to nearly 1.09 and proceed as follows:\r\nPrepare a solution of fused calcium chlorid 200 grams to the liter,\r\nand add four volumes of strong alcohol. Make the mixture exactly\r\nneutral, using a small amount of freshly prepared corallin solution as\r\na preliminary indicator, and test finally by withdrawing a portion,\r\ndiluting with an equal volume of water, and testing with cochineal\r\nsolution. Fifty cubic centimeters of this solution will precipitate\r\nthe citric acid from ten cubic centimeters of the citrate solution. To\r\nten cubic centimeters of the nearly neutral citrate solution add fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of the alcoholic calcium chlorid solution, stir well,\r\nfilter at once through a folded filter, dilute with an equal volume\r\nof water, and test the reaction with neutral solution of cochineal.\r\nIf acid or alkaline, add ammonia or citric acid, as the case may be,\r\nto the citrate solution, mix, and test again as before. Repeat this\r\nprocess until a neutral reaction of the citrate solution is obtained.\r\nAt the end the specific gravity must be 1.09 at 20°.\r\n\r\n(2) _Molybdic Solution._—See paragraph =22=.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ammonium Nitrate Solution._—Dissolve 200 grams of commercial\r\nammonium nitrate in water and bring to a volume of two liters.\r\n\r\n(4) _Magnesia Mixture._—See paragraph =22=.\r\n\r\n(5) _Dilute Ammonia for Washing._—See paragraph =22=.\r\n\r\n(6) _Magnesium Nitrate._—Dissolve 320 grams of calcined magnesia in\r\nnitric acid, avoiding an excess of the latter; then add a little\r\ncalcined magnesia in excess, boil, filter from the excess of magnesia,\r\nferric oxid, etc., and bring to volume of two liters.\r\n\r\n=54. Official Methods with Norwegian Fertilizers.=—The Director of\r\nthe Chemical Control Station of Norway, expresses the opinion, that\r\nfor Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and German conditions, the American\r\nmethods for the determination of phosphoric acid, notwithstanding\r\ntheir analytical exactness, are quite inapplicable.[40] In those\r\ncountries are found many, in part, poorly pulverized and badly mixed\r\nmanures, such as ammonium superphosphate, potassium superphosphate, and\r\npotassium ammonium superphosphate, and these can not usually be so well\r\npulverized and mixed that one can take out a true average sample of\r\nfrom two to two and five-tenths grams. Care in the analysis is useless\r\nwhen the material employed does not represent the average condition of\r\nthe materials investigated. Therefore, in the countries named, often\r\nfrom ten to twenty grams, and almost never less than five grams of\r\nsubstance are taken in the preparation of the solutions, except for\r\ninstance, in the determination of nitrogen and reverted phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n=55. The Molybdic Acid Method, as Practiced by Direction of the Union\r\nof the German Experiment Stations.=—The method adopted by the German\r\nExperiment Stations is essentially that used at Halle.[41] The samples\r\nare brought into solution in the following way: For the estimation of\r\nphosphoric acid in bone-meal, fish-guano and raw phosphates, and the\r\ntotal phosphoric acid in superphosphates, five grams of the sample are\r\ndissolved in fifty cubic centimeters of aqua regia, made of three parts\r\nof hydrochloric acid of 1.12 specific gravity and one part of nitric\r\nacid of 1.25 specific gravity, or the solution may be made of a mixture\r\nof twenty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.42 specific gravity\r\nand fifty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid of 1.8 specific gravity.\r\nThe boiling should continue for half an hour. The solution is made up\r\nto half a liter and filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\ncontaining the phosphoric acid, with double superphosphates twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters, are digested with 200 cubic centimeters of ammonium\r\nmolybdate solution for three hours at 50° in a water-bath and, after\r\ncooling, filtered, so that as little as possible of the precipitate is\r\ncollected upon the filter, which is made of strong paper.\r\n\r\nThe yellow precipitate is washed by decantation in the flask nine times\r\nwith twenty cubic centimeters of molybdic solution diluted with one\r\nvolume of water and the filter washed out once with the same quantity\r\nof liquid. The funnel, with the filter, is immediately placed upon\r\nthe flask and the portion of the precipitate collected in the filter\r\ndissolved in five per cent ammonia, which is easily accomplished by\r\nthrowing ammonia upon it from a wash-bottle. Afterwards the filter is\r\nwashed with a sufficient quantity of hot water and finally removed. The\r\ncontents of the flask are neutralized warm, with hydrochloric acid, the\r\nacid being added until the precipitate first formed, after continued\r\nshaking, is again dissolved in the liquid. The solution is then cooled\r\nand treated, drop by drop, with constant stirring, with twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of magnesia mixture. Finally twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof dilute ammonia solution are added, the precipitate is not shaken,\r\nand, after two hours, is filtered through a gooch.\r\n\r\nFor the filtering of the ammonium magnesium phosphate by the molybdic\r\nmethod, freshly prepared felts are always employed since the remarkably\r\nfine crystalline precipitates will pass through a filter which has once\r\nbeen used. It is necessary also that special precautions be taken in\r\nthe ignition. The crucible should be heated in a platinum cap, which\r\nhas the purpose of protecting the contents of the crucible from the\r\naccess of reducing gases during the ignition. After redness has been\r\nreached the cap can be removed and the crucible transferred to a blast\r\nwhere it is strongly ignited for ten minutes before weighing. The\r\nprecipitate should be pure white.\r\n\r\nThe molybdic solution is prepared as follows: 150 grams of ammonium\r\nmolybdate are dissolved in a liter of water, and after the solution is\r\ncompletely cooled, poured into a liter of nitric acid of 1.2 specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n=56. Estimation of Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=—1. The extraction of the\r\nsuperphosphates is made as follows: Twenty grams of the superphosphates\r\nare placed in a liter flask with 800 cubic centimeters of water and\r\nshaken continuously for thirty minutes. The flask is then filled with\r\nwater to the mark and the whole again thoroughly shaken and filtered.\r\nFor shaking, a machine is recommended, driven by hand or water power.\r\nThe normal rate of the machine is fixed at 150 turns per minute.\r\n\r\n2. The solution of the total superphosphates, obtained as above, must\r\nbe boiled with nitric acid before the precipitation of the phosphoric\r\nacid in order to convert any phosphoric acid present as pyrophosphoric\r\ninto tribasic phosphoric acid. For each twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof the superphosphate solution ten cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nnitric acid are added and the mixture boiled.\r\n\r\n3. The precipitation of the phosphoric acid is conducted by the\r\nmolybdenum method as usually practiced.\r\n\r\n4. For the estimation of iron and alumina in each of the\r\nsuperphosphates the Glaser method is recommended provisionally.\r\n\r\n=57. Methods for Phosphoric Acid used in the Norway Stations.=[42]—1.\r\n_Description of the Method for Total Phosphoric Acid._—For determining\r\nthe phosphoric acid in bone-meal, fish-guano, and superphosphates, five\r\ngrams of the substance, with twenty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of\r\n1.42 specific gravity, and fifty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid of\r\n1.8 specific gravity, are boiled half an hour in a half liter flask,\r\ndiluted with water, and after cooling, made up to the mark. Fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate are made alkaline with ammonia, then acid\r\nwith nitric acid, precipitated with fifty cubic centimeters of molybdic\r\nsolution for every one-tenth gram of phosphorus pentoxid present,\r\nheated over the water-bath for one hour, and allowed to stand twelve\r\nhours more, when the supernatant liquid is separated by decantation the\r\nprecipitate washed thoroughly with dilute molybdate solution (1: 4)\r\ndissolved in warm dilute ammonia, and the filter washed with hot water.\r\nThe ammoniacal solution is neutralized with hydrochloric acid, cooled,\r\nmixed, drop by drop, with constant stirring, with from ten to twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of magnesia mixture, and after a quarter of an hour\r\none-third the volume of ten per cent ammonia is added. This is allowed\r\nto stand two hours, is filtered, washed with five per cent of ammonia\r\nuntil the disappearance of the chlorin reaction, dried, burned in an\r\nopen crucible over a bunsen, and finally for a quarter of an hour, in a\r\ncovered crucible heated over the blast.\r\n\r\n2. _Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—To twenty grams of the substance\r\nin a liter flask, are added 800 cubic centimeters of water, and shaken\r\nevery fifteen minutes for two hours; the volume made up to the mark\r\nand the phosphoric acid in fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate,\r\nequaling one gram substance, is determined as under total.\r\n\r\n3. _Reverted Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—Two and five-tenths\r\ngrams substance are rubbed up with water, then washed upon the filter\r\nwith about 100 cubic centimeters of water, the residue on the filter\r\nwashed into a flask with a part of the measured citrate solution,\r\nand digested one hour at 35° to 40° with 200 cubic centimeters of\r\nPetermann’s citrate solution. The water and citrate extracts are made\r\nup to a quarter of a liter each, and the phosphoric acid determined in\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty cubic centimeters, according to the quantity\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n_Solutions._ 1. _Molybdate Solution._—375 grams of ammonium molybdate\r\nare dissolved in two and five-tenths liters of water, and the solution\r\npoured into two and five-tenths liters of nitric acid of 1.20 specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n2. _Magnesia Mixture._—275 grams of crystallized magnesium chlorid and\r\n350 grams of ammonium chlorid are dissolved in 3250 cubic centimeters\r\nof water and filled up to five liters with ammonia of 0.96 specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n3. _Petermann’s Solution._—One kilogram of citric acid is dissolved\r\nin about two liters of water and 1350 cubic centimeters of ammonia\r\nof 0.925 specific gravity and filled up with water to 5750 cubic\r\ncentimeters. The solution then has a specific gravity of 1.09; 300\r\ncubic centimeters of ammonia of 0.925 specific gravity are now added.\r\n\r\n=58. Swedish Official Method for Determination of Phosphoric\r\nAcid.=[43]—The Swedish chemists determine phosphoric acid in\r\nfertilizers both by the molybdate and the citrate methods. These\r\nmethods carefully conducted according to the directions given below,\r\ngive very concordant results. In doubtful cases the former method is\r\ntaken as the deciding one, it having proved by long practice to give\r\nvery satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n_Reagents for the Molybdate Method._—1. _Molybdic Solution._—Prepared\r\nby dissolving 100 grams of finely powdered molybdic acid with heat,\r\nin 400 grams of eight per cent ammonia of 0.967 specific gravity\r\nand pouring the solution into 1,500 grams of nitric acid of one and\r\ntwo-tenths specific gravity; or else by dissolving 150 grams ammonium\r\nmolybdate in one liter of hot water, and pouring the solution into one\r\nliter of nitric acid of 1.2 specific gravity. Prepared in this way,\r\nthe molybdic solution will contain, in the former case five per cent,\r\nin the latter case from five to six per cent of molybdic acid, and 100\r\ncubic centimeters of it are required for precipitating one-tenth gram\r\nof phosphorus pentoxid.\r\n\r\n2. _Magnesia Mixture._—Prepared from 110 grams of crystallized\r\nmagnesium chlorid, 140 grams ammonium chlorid, 700 grams of eight per\r\ncent ammonia of 0.967 specific gravity and 1,300 grams of distilled\r\nwater. The mixture is filtered after a few days, if necessary; ten\r\ncubic centimeters of the same are required for precipitating one-tenth\r\ngram of phosphorus pentoxid.\r\n\r\n3. _Ten per cent ammonia_ of 0.959 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n(a) _Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—1. _Preparation of the Aqueous\r\nSolution._—Of superphosphates and in general fertilizers containing\r\nwater-soluble phosphoric acid, a sample of twenty grams is taken,\r\nand water poured over it in a mortar; lumps are crushed lightly, but\r\ncompletely with the pestle without pulverizing it finer; the whole mass\r\nis then washed into a graduated flask holding one liter, which at once\r\nis filled up to the mark. The volume taken up by the residue insoluble\r\nin water, is left out of consideration in the calculation. The sample\r\nis left standing in the flask (which is occasionally shaken) at the\r\nordinary temperature of the room for two hours, and the solution is\r\nthen filtered.\r\n\r\n2. _The Determination._—Take twenty-five cubic centimeters of the\r\nsuperphosphate solution thus prepared (when a twenty per cent sample\r\nis taken equal to one-tenth gram phosphorus pentoxid); add a quantity\r\nof molybdic solution sufficient for complete precipitation, leave\r\nstanding for four hours in a beaker covered with a watch-glass; decant\r\nthe solution through a small filter, wash the precipitate first by\r\ndecantation, then on filter, with a mixture containing 100 parts\r\nmolybdic solution, twenty parts nitric acid of 1.2 specific gravity,\r\nand eighty parts water, until a few drops put into alcohol, to which\r\nsome dilute sulfuric acid has been added, does not, any longer, cause\r\nturbidity. The molybdic precipitate is now washed with but little water\r\nfrom the filter into a beaker, and particles adhering to the filter are\r\ndissolved by a hot mixture of one part ammonia and three parts water,\r\nwhich is allowed to flow into the beaker till the precipitate is,\r\nfinally, completely dissolved in it. To the clear solution, add dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid while stirring, till the yellow precipitate formed\r\nby the acid is no longer immediately dissolved; then add from six to\r\neight cubic centimeters of ammonia through the filter. The volume of\r\nthe solution is not to exceed seventy-five cubic centimeters. It is now\r\ncooled completely and one cubic centimeter of magnesia mixture is added\r\nfrom a burette for every centigram of phosphorus pentoxid which it is\r\nexpected to contain, and finally one-quarter of its volume of ammonia\r\nis added. The precipitate may be filtered after four hours. This is\r\nwashed on the filter, preferably by means of suction, with a mixture of\r\none part ammonia and three parts water till the filtrate is entirely\r\nfree from chlorin. After drying, heat the precipitate, first gently,\r\nthen stronger, and finally with a blast for a few minutes and then\r\nweigh it.\r\n\r\nTreated with hydrochloric acid it must leave no insoluble residue\r\n(SiO₂), nor should hydrogen sulfid cause any precipitation in the\r\nsolution thus formed (MoO₃).\r\n\r\n(b) _Total Phosphoric Acid._—1. _In Superphosphates._—For the\r\ndetermination of total phosphoric acid, treat a weighed quantity of the\r\nsuperphosphate with nitric acid, if necessary to bring a difficultly\r\nsoluble residue into solution, with addition of hydrochloric acid, or\r\nof potassium chlorate, to destroy organic matter present. Dilute the\r\nsolution to a definite volume, and determine the phosphoric acid in a\r\nmeasured quantity of the same, as directed under (a) 2; if hydrochloric\r\nacid or potassium chlorate, be applied in the preparation of the\r\nsolution, however, not till the measured quantity has been repeatedly\r\nevaporated to dryness with concentrated nitric acid.\r\n\r\n2. _In Bone-meal._—Destroy organic matter in five grams of the sample\r\nby ignition, dissolve the residue in nitric acid, filter from the\r\ninsoluble residue, dilute the filtrate to half a liter, take an aliquot\r\npart containing about one-tenth gram phosphorus pentoxid and determine\r\nthe phosphoric acid as directed under (a) 2.\r\n\r\n3. _In Fish-guano_ (and other fertilizing materials of organic\r\norigin).—The organic matter cannot here be removed by simple ignition,\r\nas in this way a loss of phosphorus may take place; It is therefore\r\ndestroyed either in the wet way through nitric acid and potassium\r\nchlorate or in the dry way by fusion with a mixture of potassium\r\nnitrate and sodium carbonate, otherwise the procedure is as in (b) 1.\r\n\r\n4. _In Mineral Phosphates._—Determine the phosphoric acid in a solution\r\nobtained by nitric acid; organic matter is destroyed preferably in the\r\nwet way.\r\n\r\n5. _In Basic Slag._—Dissolve ten grams of powdered slag by treating it\r\nwith 100 cubic centimeters of fuming hydrochloric acid with heat; wash\r\nthe solution into a graduated half liter flask, fill to the mark, shake\r\nwell, and filter. Determine the phosphoric acid in twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the clear filtrate, according to (a) 2, after having\r\nfirst, however, evaporated the solution to dryness and then at least\r\nthree times evaporated the residue to dryness with concentrated nitric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n=59. Method Employed by the Royal Experiment Station of Holland.=—_A.\r\nSoluble Phosphoric Acid._[44]—The necessary reagents are:\r\n\r\n(1) Molybdate solution, made by dissolving 150 grams of ammonium\r\nmolybdate in a liter of water and pouring the solution into a liter of\r\nnitric acid of 1.20 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n(2) A ten per cent solution of ammonium nitrate.\r\n\r\n(3) Strong and dilute ammonia, the latter being between two and\r\nfive-tenths and three per cent of 0.988 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n(4) Magnesia mixture made by dissolving 110 grams of crystallized\r\nmagnesium chlorid, 140 grams of ammonium chlorid, and 700 cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia of 0.96 specific gravity in water and bringing\r\nthe solution to two liters.\r\n\r\n(5) Ammoniacal citrate solution, made by dissolving 500 grams of citric\r\nacid in a liter of water, and mixing with four liters of ten per cent\r\nammonia of 0.96 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—Place twenty grams of substance in a mortar together\r\nwith some cold distilled water or pure rain water, stir, and decant\r\nthe water and suspended matters into a liter flask. After this has\r\nbeen repeated several times, rub up the residual mass and wash it all\r\ninto the flask. Fill up to about 900 cubic centimeters and allow to\r\nstand two hours (twenty-four hours in the case of double phosphates\r\nwith more than twenty-two per cent of soluble phosphoric acid),\r\nshaking repeatedly; or shaking continuously, for half an hour. Fill\r\nup to the liter mark and filter through a dry filter. Take portions\r\nof twenty-five or fifty cubic centimeters for each determination, add\r\n100 cubic centimeters of molybdate solution for each 100 milligrams of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid present, warm to about 80° for an hour, filter, and\r\nwash the precipitate with the ammonium nitrate solution. Add a little\r\nmolybdate solution to the filtrate, warm, and, if a fresh precipitate\r\nbe observed, it is to be added to the first. The precipitate is to\r\nbe dissolved in ammonia, and hydrochloric acid carefully added until\r\nthe precipitate caused by it only slowly redissolves on stirring. The\r\nphosphoric acid is precipitated from the clear liquid which is still\r\nammoniacal with magnesia mixture, using ten cubic centimeters for each\r\n100 milligrams of phosphorus pentoxid present. This is added, drop\r\nby drop, and the liquid kept stirred during the addition. Allow it\r\nto stand at least two hours, filter, wash with dilute ammonia, dry,\r\nand ignite. This last is done at first with a very small flame but is\r\nfinished with the blast-lamp or in a Rössler furnace. To insure burning\r\nto whiteness, nitric acid may be used, but not more than one or two\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\n_B. Total Phosphoric Acid._—(1) For bone and flesh-meal, fish-guano,\r\nand similar fertilizers the reagents necessary are the same as before.\r\n\r\nCarefully burn five grams to ash, boil the ash for half an hour with\r\nnitric acid of 1.32 specific gravity, dilute with water, and, after\r\ncooling, dilute to 500 cubic centimeters. Filter through a dry filter\r\nand take fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate. Add 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the molybdate solution for each 100 milligrams of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid present. Treat further as before described.\r\n\r\n(2) Phosphates, guanos, bone-black, etc.\r\n\r\nOne gram of substance, after powdering, and, if necessary, igniting,\r\nis covered with four cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of 1.13\r\nspecific gravity and a little water and heated for an hour and a half.\r\nEvaporate to dryness without filtration, making repeated additions of\r\nnitric acid until no more vapors of hydrochloric acid are evolved. Boil\r\nthe residue with nitric acid, cool, make up to 100 cubic centimeters\r\nwith water, and shake. Filter and treat fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe resulting solution by the molybdate method and proceed further as\r\nbefore described.\r\n\r\n=60. Sources of Error in the Molybdate Method.=—When conducted with\r\nproper care, the gravimetric molybdate method is one of the most exact\r\nprocesses known to analytical chemistry.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some sources of error in the process which should\r\nbe avoided as carefully as possible or taken into account.\r\n\r\n1. _Error Due to Occluded Silica._—When silica passes into solution in\r\nthe original sample, and this may be the case especially with mineral\r\nphosphates, it may appear both in the yellow precipitate and in the\r\nfinal magnesium pyrophosphate. In all such cases the residue, after\r\nignition, should be dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and any insoluble\r\nresidue weighed as silica and deducted from the first weight. If the\r\nsilica be removed by evaporating the solution of the original material\r\nto dryness, and igniting to destroy organic matter, care must be taken\r\nto reconvert all phosphoric acid into the ortho form by long boiling\r\nwith nitric acid before precipitation.\r\n\r\nAnother method of avoiding any trouble from silica consists in using\r\nsulfuric and a little nitric acid as the solvent for the original\r\nsubstance. Silica is not soluble in hot concentrated sulfuric acid. The\r\nvolume of the sulfuric should be about ten times that of the nitric\r\nacid used, and the boiling be continued until sulfuric vapors are\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\n2. _Error Due to Arsenic._—Only in rare cases will arsenic be found in\r\nphosphatic fertilizing materials. In case of pyritic phosphates, the\r\niron disulfid may carry arsenic. The solution in such a case is best\r\naccomplished in hydrochloric acid. If aqua regia be used, all nitric\r\nacid should be removed by repeated evaporation with hydrochloric. The\r\narsenic can then be precipitated in the hot dilute hydrochloric acid\r\nsolution by hydrogen sulfid.\r\n\r\n3. _Error Due to Occluded Magnesia._—The danger of contamination of\r\nthe yellow precipitate with magnesium oxid has been pointed out by\r\nsome authors. The re-solution of the precipitate followed by a second\r\nprecipitation is the usual remedy proposed. Lorenz states that this\r\nsource of error may be entirely avoided by the addition of two per cent\r\nof citric acid to the phosphomolybdate solution.[45]\r\n\r\n4. _Error Due to Volatility of Phosphoric Acid._—This source of error\r\nhas been made the subject of a special study by Neubauer.[46]\r\n\r\nFrom the results, a table has been constructed, the use of which is\r\nrecommended for phosphoric acid determinations. The source of error\r\nin this method lies exclusively in the loss of phosphoric acid by\r\nvolatilization. The magnesia-covered crucible lid offers a very good\r\ncontrol of this error, and its use is recommended to the analyst. Of\r\ncourse, the presence of sulfur in the gas used for ignition is liable\r\nto disturb this check.\r\n\r\nThe following course of procedure in the determination of phosphoric\r\nacid can be recommended to avoid or correct this error:\r\n\r\nSeparate the phosphoric acid in the form of the yellow precipitate\r\nand wash this latter in the usual way. Too high a heat should not be\r\nemployed, nor should the solutions be allowed to stand too long lest\r\nexcess of molybdic acid separate. Dissolve the phosphomolybdate in 100\r\ncubic centimeters of cold two and five-tenths per cent ammonia and add\r\nas many cubic centimeters of the usual magnesia mixture (fifty-five\r\ngrams magnesium chlorid and seventy grams ammonium chlorid dissolved\r\nin a liter of two and five-tenths per cent ammonia) as there are\r\ncentigrams of phosphorus pentoxid present. Addition should not be\r\nmade faster than ten cubic centimeters per minute. Stir during the\r\naddition. After the precipitation, stir briskly once more and then\r\nallow to stand at least three hours. Wash with two and five-tenths per\r\ncent ammonia till the chlorin reaction disappears, dry the filter,\r\nand introduce into a well-cleaned crucible which has been thoroughly\r\nignited. Place the lid at an angle, carbonize the filter, and\r\ngradually raise the heat, though not higher than a medium red heat,\r\ntill the pyrophosphate becomes completely white. When this happens\r\nbring the blast into action and ignite to constant weight. The weight\r\nfinally accepted must not change even after half an hour’s ignition.\r\nUpon this requirement especial stress must be laid. Pure magnesium\r\npyrophosphate does not suffer any loss even after several hours’\r\nignition nor does a good platinum crucible. To the weighed amount of\r\npyrophosphate, add the correction given in the table. For example, if\r\nthe weight be 250 milligrams, the correction to be added is four and\r\ntwo-tenths milligrams, and the correct weight is then 254.2 milligrams.\r\nMultiplication of the sum by sixty-four gives the amount of phosphorus\r\npentoxid in the weight taken for analysis.\r\n\r\nCORRECTION FOR PHOSPHORIC ACID DETERMINATION.\r\n\r\n      Found,           Lost,             Found,         Lost,\r\n     Mg₂P₂O₇         milligrams          Mg₂P₂O₇       milligrams\r\n    in grams.

The Color of the Magnesium Pyrophosphate.=—After the final\r\nignition of the magnesium pyrophosphate, whether secured by the citrate\r\nor the molybdic method, a black or grayish tint is often noticed. This\r\nmay be due to traces of organic matter brought down by the precipitate\r\nand especially to a lack of care in the initial ignition. Many devices\r\nhave been proposed for the purpose of avoiding this coloration,\r\nalthough general experiments have shown that there is no appreciable\r\nincrease in the weight of the precipitate when colored in this way.\r\n\r\nWhen the precipitation is carried on according to the citrate method,\r\nNeubauer[47] proposes to eliminate this coloration by the use of\r\nammonium sulfate. About seven cubic centimeters of a saturated\r\nsolution of ammonium sulfate should be added to the solution before\r\nthe precipitation by the magnesium mixture. With this precaution it is\r\npossible to obtain a perfectly white precipitate after five minutes of\r\nignition. The lively glowing of the precipitate throughout the whole\r\nmass at the time of changing into pyrophosphate, is much more easily\r\nobserved by this treatment than when the mass is gray or black. Even\r\nshould the addition of the ammonium sulfate solution to one containing\r\na large amount of lime produce a precipitate of crystalline calcium\r\nsulfate, it is of no importance inasmuch as the ammonium citrate\r\nimmediately dissolves large quantities of the calcium salt.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory a white pyrophosphate is easily obtained by treating\r\nthe precipitate on the gooch after washing free of chlorids with a drop\r\nor two of ammonium nitrate. The ignition is commenced very gently at\r\nfirst and afterwards when the mass is white the blast is used.\r\n\r\nIf the ignited residue be gray it may sometimes be whitened by\r\nmoistening with a drop or two of nitric acid, burning at a very low\r\ntemperature, followed by the blast. There is no appreciable difference\r\nin weight between a gray and white pyrophosphate.\r\n\r\n=62. Determination of Phosphoric Acid and Nitrogen in the Same Solution\r\nby Treatment with Sulfuric Acid and Mercury.=—Fertilizing materials\r\nwhich contain organic nitrogen and phosphoric acid, such as bones, are\r\nof such a nature that it is often difficult to obtain a fair sample\r\nof them in quantities suited to the direct determination; _viz._,\r\nabout one gram. Thus it often becomes important to take a much larger\r\nquantity of the material, to bring it into solution and to take an\r\naliquot part thereof. It may also often happen that it is important to\r\ndetermine the phosphoric acid in the same sample which has been used\r\nfor the determination of the nitrogen by moist combustion with sulfuric\r\nacid and mercury. In this connection, however, it is somewhat difficult\r\nto avoid the precipitation of some of the mercury with the phosphoric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe mercuric sulfate which is produced by the Kjeldahl method is\r\nnot precipitated in the presence of ammoniacal solution of ammonium\r\ncitrate, but there may be small quantities of mercurous salts present\r\nor some finely divided metallic mercury which may contaminate\r\nmechanically the phosphate precipitate. These disturbing influences may\r\nbe removed by previous treatment with sodium chlorid. If from fifty\r\nto sixty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid have been used for the\r\nsolution and oxidation and this be made up to half a liter, it will be\r\nsufficiently dilute to permit an almost quantitative separation of the\r\nmercurous chlorid produced by treatment with sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\nNeubauer, who has proposed this method, finds that when sodium chlorid\r\nis used previous to the precipitation of the phosphoric acid, a\r\nprecipitate of ordinary size contains, at most, only one milligram\r\nof mercury, while without the use of sodium chlorid as much as four\r\nmilligrams may be found. The details of the method employed by Neubauer\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nTen grams of the fertilizing material are placed in a half liter flask\r\nwith from fifty to sixty cubic centimeters of strong sulfuric acid,\r\ntwo grams of mercury, and a little paraffin to prevent foaming. The\r\noxidation is carried on as usual in the Kjeldahl method. The liquid,\r\nafter cooling, is diluted with water and one cubic centimeter of a\r\ncitrate solution of sodium chlorid added, cooled, filled to the mark,\r\nfiltered, and fifty cubic centimeters taken for the determination of\r\nthe phosphoric acid, according to the citrate method and the same\r\nquantity for the determination of the ammonia by distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITRATE METHOD.\r\n\r\n=63. General Principles.=—It has been seen that in the molybdic method\r\nthere is introduced a process at considerable cost, both of reagents\r\nand time, having for its object the separation of the phosphoric acid\r\nfrom all the other acids and bases which may have been present in the\r\noriginal sample. The phosphorus is thus obtained in composition with\r\nmolybdenum and ammonium in a form easily soluble in ammonia, from which\r\nit can be accurately separated by means of a soluble salt of magnesia.\r\n\r\nThe citrate method has for its object the suppression of this\r\nintermediate step and the determination of the phosphoric acid by\r\ndirect precipitation in presence of iron, lime, and alumina. The\r\nprinciple on which it is based rests on the well-known power of an\r\nalkaline ammonium citrate to hold in solution the salts of iron,\r\nalumina, and lime, while at the same time it permits of the separation\r\nof phosphoric acid, as ammonium magnesium phosphate. In no case can the\r\ncitrate method be regarded as an exact analytical process, but large\r\nexperience has shown that the errors of the method are compensatory and\r\nthat it affords a good and ready method for fertilizer control.\r\n\r\nWhen phosphoric acid solutions which contain no iron, lime, alumina, or\r\nmanganese, are precipitated in presence of ammonium citrate the results\r\nobtained vary markedly with the quantity of magnesia mixture employed.\r\nGrupe and Tollens[48] were the first to point out that a portion of\r\nthe phosphoric acid might remain in solution, but that the precipitate\r\nmight contain a sufficient excess of magnesia to compensate for the\r\nloss. It has been further shown by Glaser[49] that a portion of the\r\nphosphoric acid may be lost by volatilization in the citrate method.\r\nWhen the ignition is carried on in a crucible where the cover is\r\ncoated with magnesia to intercept the volatilized acid, a considerable\r\nquantity of it can be recovered by the molybdic method.\r\n\r\nWhere too little magnesia mixture is employed, therefore, two sources\r\nof loss are to be guarded against; _viz._, a part of the phosphoric\r\nacid may remain in solution and another part be volatilized on\r\nignition. The explanation of the volatilization is as follows: In the\r\npresence of ammonium citrate, magnesium chlorid may be partly converted\r\ninto magnesium citrate and ammonium chlorid. There may be a time,\r\ntherefore, in the precipitation with not too great excess of magnesia\r\nmixture, when proportionally there is little magnesium chlorid and much\r\nammonium chlorid present. The formation of a salt represented by the\r\nformula Mg(NH₄)₄(PO₄)₂ may take place which, upon ignition, breaks up\r\ninto Mg(PO₃)₂ and finally passes into Mg₂P₂O₇ with loss of P₂O₅. This\r\ntheoretical condition has but little weight, however, practically in\r\nthe analysis of fertilizers, since in these cases a large quantity of\r\nlime is always present. But even in these cases traces of volatile P₂O₅\r\nmay be discovered.\r\n\r\nWells[50] has shown that the citrate method gives good results in\r\ncertain conditions but that this accuracy is reached by a fortunate\r\ncompensation of errors. The ammonium magnesium salt does not\r\nprecipitate all the phosphoric acid in this process, but contains\r\nenough impurities to make up for this loss.\r\n\r\nJohnson[51] in conjunction with Osborne has shown that the results\r\nby the citrate method practiced in accordance with the details\r\nlaid down by Vögel, are too low, but that this difficulty could be\r\novercome by using more and stronger magnesia mixture and a larger\r\nquantity of strong ammonia solution. The citrate method was found to\r\ngive unsatisfactory results when iron and alumina were present in\r\nany considerable quantity. In the examination of the final ignited\r\nprecipitate, which should be pure magnesium pyrophosphate, it was found\r\nto consist of only 94.98 to 97.83 per cent of that salt. The chief\r\nimpurity found was calcium oxid, the percentage of which varied from\r\n2.05 to 3.95 in six cases. There was also a considerable percentage of\r\nloss due, probably, to magnesia and pyrophosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe presence of large quantities of iron and alumina also impairs the\r\naccuracy of the molybdate method when the precipitation of the yellow\r\nsalt takes place at too high a temperature. When the temperature of\r\nprecipitation in the method is above 50° the results are likely to be\r\ntoo high while a great excess of nitric acid in the reagent may produce\r\na contrary effect. In the latter case the filtrate from the yellow salt\r\nshould be mixed with additional quantities of molybdate solution until\r\nno further precipitate takes place.\r\n\r\nMany methods of conducting the citrate method have been proposed but\r\nthe best of them are based on the one elaborated at the experiment\r\nstation of Halle by Bühring, and which will be given in the next\r\nparagraph, followed by some other methods in use in other localities.\r\n\r\n=64. Method of the Halle Agricultural Experiment Station.=[52]—The\r\ncitrate method, as described by Morgen, is the one employed.[53] The\r\nprinciple depends upon the direct precipitation of the phosphoric acid\r\nby magnesia mixture. By the addition of a solution of ammonium-citrate\r\nthe precipitation of lime, iron, alumina, and other bases, is\r\nprevented. The precipitate of ammonium magnesium phosphate is converted\r\nby ignition into magnesium pyrophosphate and weighed as such. By the\r\nuse of this method a part of the phosphoric acid sometimes escapes\r\nprecipitation and a portion of the other bases is sometimes thrown down\r\nwith the precipitate. Experience has shown that by adhering to certain\r\nprecautions the weight of impurities in the precipitate may be made to\r\ncorrespond exactly to the weight of the phosphoric acid which escapes\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.\r\n\r\nSHAKING APPARATUS FOR SUPERPHOSPHATES.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Soluble Acid._—The soluble phosphates are first brought into\r\nsolution in such a way that one liter of water contains the soluble\r\nphosphoric acid from twenty grams of the substance. Twenty grams are\r\nrubbed in a porcelain mortar with water and through a wide-necked\r\nfunnel washed into a bottle-shaped flask in which a little water has\r\nbeen previously placed. The flasks employed are made of thick glass\r\nin order to withstand shaking. After the substance is washed, the\r\nflasks are filled to the mark and closed with rubber stoppers. They are\r\nthen placed upon a shaking rack as indicated in Fig. 3, which is also\r\nfurnished with an apparatus for separating the fine meal from basic\r\nslag.\r\n\r\nOn a table, as shown in the figure, is fastened a movable horizontal\r\nboard by means of hinges. At the left hand of this movable board is\r\nplaced an open wooden box in which is a perforated shelf for the\r\npurpose of holding the flasks, so as to prevent their striking together\r\nduring the shaking.\r\n\r\nFor the best results the substance to be examined should be placed\r\nin the flask in a dry state and then 800 cubic centimeters of water\r\nadded and shaken by means of the machine indicated for half an\r\nhour. Afterwards the flasks are filled up to the mark, well shaken,\r\nand filtered through double folded filters into ordinary flasks of\r\nabout 400 cubic centimeters capacity. Before any of the filtrate is\r\ncollected, the first that runs through should be well shaken in the\r\nreceiving flasks and rejected. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nthus collected, corresponding to one gram of the substance, should be\r\nused for the determination.\r\n\r\n(2) _Total Acid._—For total phosphoric acid, including the insoluble\r\nportions, the material is treated as follows: Five grams of the\r\nsubstance are placed in a 500 cubic centimeter flask with twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid of 1.42 specific gravity, and fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of pure concentrated sulfuric acid, and boiled briskly for\r\nhalf an hour. With substances which contain much organic material,\r\na little paraffin is added to avoid frothing. Such substances also\r\nrequire a larger quantity of nitric acid than that above specified. The\r\nflasks are allowed to cool, water added, again allowed to cool, and\r\nfilled up to the mark at 17°.5. If hydrochloric instead of sulfuric\r\nacid be used in making the above solution, when the citrate method\r\nis employed, the results are always too high because the precipitate\r\ncontains lime and alumina in such quantities as to render any\r\ncompensation for them inaccurate. In addition to this the sulfuric\r\nhas this great advantage over the hydrochloric acid; _viz._, in not\r\nseparating silicic acid, inasmuch as the silicic acid is insoluble in\r\nboiling sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n(3) _Citrate-Soluble Acid._—Two grams of the sample are digested with\r\n100 cubic centimeters of citrate solution, 1.09 specific gravity, for\r\nhalf an hour at 50° in a beaker. Afterwards the soluble matter is\r\nseparated by filtration with the aid of a filter-pump and the residue\r\nwashed with a solution of one part water and one part citrate solution\r\nuntil all the dissolved phosphoric acid is removed from the filter.\r\nGenerally three or four washings are sufficient. The residue on the\r\nfilter is dried, ignited, and dissolved in a mixture of two cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric and twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid,\r\nthe solution made up to a volume of 200 cubic centimeters, filtered,\r\nand 100 cubic centimeters of the filtrate taken for the determination.\r\nThe acid in the filtrate is nearly neutralized and fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of citrate solution are added, and afterwards twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of magnesia mixture and twenty cubic centimeters of\r\ntwenty-four per cent ammonia. After standing for forty-eight hours, the\r\nprecipitate is separated by filtration, ignited, and weighed in the\r\nusual way. The difference between the total phosphoric acid and that in\r\nthe insoluble residue, after treatment with ammonium citrate, as above,\r\ngives the quantity of phosphoric acid soluble in the citrate solution.\r\nThe difference between the total citrate-soluble and the water-soluble\r\ngives the quantity of the reverted phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe ammonium citrate solution used for the digestion is made as\r\nfollows: Two hundred and fifty grams of crystallized citric acid\r\nare dissolved in half a liter of hot water, diluted with 550 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, 276 cubic centimeters of twenty-four per cent\r\nammonia added, and finally, exactly neutralized by adding, little by\r\nlittle, fifty per cent citric acid solution.\r\n\r\nThe Halle methods of separating the water and citrate-soluble acids\r\nappear to be less complete and reliable than those in use by the\r\nOfficial Agricultural Chemists of this country. The precipitation of\r\nbasic phosphates, when large quantities of water are used at once in\r\nseparating soluble acid, must tend to diminish the quantity obtained,\r\nwhile the lack of care in assuring the neutrality of the citrate\r\nsolution might lead to varying results.\r\n\r\n(4) _Double Superphosphates._—In the case of double superphosphates,\r\nwhich sometimes contain large quantities of pyrophosphate, the solution\r\nis made in the usual way so that in 100 cubic centimeters there will\r\nbe contained two grams of the substance. Usually ten grains are taken\r\nand the volume made up to half a liter. Twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate are diluted with seventy-five cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and the pyro converted to orthophosphoric acid by heating with\r\nten cubic centimeters of strong nitric acid on a sand-bath. The heating\r\nshould be continued until the volume be reduced to twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters. The strongly acid liquid is made alkaline with ammonia,\r\nand afterwards slightly acid with nitric, and the rest of the process\r\nis carried on in the usual way.\r\n\r\n(5) _Phosphoric Acid in the Residue of Superphosphate Manufacture._—In\r\nthe mixture of superphosphates and gypsum, the residue of the\r\nmanufacture of double superphosphates, the phosphoric acid is estimated\r\nin the following manner: Five grams of the substance are placed in a\r\ndish, rubbed up with absolute alcohol, and washed into a 250 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask. The flask is filled with absolute alcohol to the\r\nmark, closed with a stopper, and with frequent shaking, allowed to\r\nstand for two hours; it is thereupon filtered as quickly as possible;\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate corresponding to one gram\r\nof the substance, are taken for the estimation. This fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters is evaporated on a sand-bath to a sirupy consistence,\r\ndiluted with water, and treated, as in the case of the soluble\r\nphosphates above mentioned. In all cases as described above, after\r\nthe solutions are obtained they are treated with the ammonium citrate\r\nsolution and the phosphoric acid estimated as in the first instance\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n(6) _Solutions Employed._—\r\n\r\n    (a) The citrate solution is made as follows: 1,500 grams of\r\n    citric acid are dissolved in water, treated with five liters\r\n    of twenty-four per cent ammonia, and made up to fifteen liters.\r\n\r\n    (b) The magnesia mixture is made as follows: 500 grams of\r\n    magnesium chlorid, 1,050 grams of ammonium chlorid, three\r\n    and five-tenths liters of twenty-four per cent ammonia, and\r\n    six and five-tenths liters of distilled water are used.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the superphosphates fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\ncitrate solution are employed and with the basic slags 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters; and in both cases twenty-five cubic centimeters of the\r\nmagnesia mixture.\r\n\r\n(7) _Details of the Manipulation._—On the addition of the citrate\r\nsolution there should be no permanent troubling of the liquid but\r\nthere should be a total clearing up thereof. In order to facilitate\r\nthis, after the addition of the citrate solution, the flasks should be\r\ngently shaken in order to distribute the solution throughout the mass.\r\nSolutions from bone-black superphosphates show sometimes, after the\r\naddition of the citrate solution, a more or less strong opalescence,\r\nbut this opalescence does not influence the results. Should it\r\nhappen that with superphosphates which are made from raw material\r\ncontaining large excesses of iron or clay, fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe citrate solution are not sufficient to prevent the other bases\r\nfrom being precipitated, an additional quantity up to twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters may be added. The addition of the magnesia mixture\r\nmust follow as quickly as possible after the addition of the citrate\r\nsolution to avoid a separation of crystalline calcium phosphate. On the\r\naddition of the citrate solution there is always a rise in temperature.\r\nInasmuch as the precipitation of the phosphoric acid with magnesia must\r\ntake place in the cold, the liquid must be cooled after the addition\r\nof the citrate,[54] and the cooling should take place as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe above method was adopted by the chemical section of the\r\nInternational Agricultural Congress held at Vienna, September, 1890.[55]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.\r\n\r\nSHAKING MACHINE FOR AMMONIUM MAGNESIUM PHOSPHATE.]\r\n\r\nIn order to hasten the precipitation of the ammonium magnesium\r\nphosphate and to prevent the fixation of the precipitate on the walls\r\nof the erlenmeyer, the flask should be shaken for half an hour. For\r\nthis purpose the flasks should be closed with smooth well-fitting\r\nrubber stoppers and placed in a shaking machine. The shaking machine\r\nof the form given in Fig. 4, recommended by the Halle station, is very\r\nconveniently used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn a vertical axis are carried two stages for holding the flasks.\r\nThe flasks are prevented from striking each other by means of the\r\npartitions shown. The apparatus is conveniently driven by a small\r\nwater-motor, as indicated, which imparts to the stages a partial back\r\nand forth revolution.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking for half an hour, any precipitate adhering to the rubber\r\nstoppers is carefully washed off with ammonia water into the flask. The\r\nfiltration can be made immediately after the shaking or after two or\r\nthree days; the results are the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.\r\n\r\nRÖSSLER IGNITION FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nThe filtration of the ammonium magnesium phosphate is made through\r\nperforated crucibles. The asbestos felt is prepared in the following\r\nway: The coarse fibers of asbestos are chopped up with a sharp knife on\r\na glass plate and boiled for two hours with strong hydrochloric acid;\r\nafterwards, by repeated washing with distilled water they are freed\r\nfrom acid and the too fine particles of asbestos which would tend to\r\nmake the filter too impervious. After the last wash-water is poured\r\noff, the asbestos is suspended in water and used for making the felt on\r\nthe filter. The preparation of the crucible and the filtration under\r\npressure are accomplished in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe ignition of the precipitate is accomplished in a Rössler ignition\r\noven, Fig. 5. When the muffle of the furnace shows a white heat or a\r\nwhite-red heat it is at the proper temperature for the estimation.\r\nAt higher temperatures, the asbestos felt is easily injured.\r\nGenerally, an ignition of five minutes is sufficient, but with double\r\nsuperphosphates, ten minutes are required.\r\n\r\n=65. The Swedish Citrate Method.=[56]—This method of determining\r\nphosphoric acid is founded on the fact that phosphoric acid in the\r\npresence of calcium salts, without it being necessary, previously, to\r\nconvert it into phosphomolybdate, is precipitated directly by magnesia\r\nmixture from a solution, to which ammonium citrate has been added,\r\nprovided first, that the solution contain a sufficient quantity of\r\nsulfuric acid, and second, that only as much citrate be added as is\r\nrequired to keep the calcium salts in alkaline solution.[57]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._ (1) _Citric Acid Solution._—Prepared by dissolving 500\r\ngrams of citric acid in water, and completing to a volume of one liter.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ten Per Cent Ammonia_ of 0.959 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n(3) _Magnesia Mixture_, of the usual composition.\r\n\r\nThe various processes are conducted as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—Add twenty cubic centimeters of\r\ncitric acid solution to fifty cubic centimeters of the water-soluble\r\nsolution obtained according to the Swedish molybdenum method, and\r\nthen add thirty-three cubic centimeters of ammonia. When the mixture\r\nhas cooled, add slowly twenty-five cubic centimeters of the magnesia\r\nmixture, and then forty-two cubic centimeters of the ammonia. Keep the\r\nsolution stirred by means of a closely clipped feather which is pressed\r\ntightly against the sides of the beaker; by this process the phosphate\r\nis precipitated after half an hour in pure condition and completely,\r\nwithout, in the least, sticking to the wall of the beaker; filter,\r\nwash, and ignite, as usually directed.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Insoluble Phosphoric Add._—Moisten, in a porcelain dish, ten\r\ngrams of the powdered sample with water; add fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof concentrated sulfuric acid, and heat for fifteen minutes so high\r\nthat fumes of sulfuric acid will escape. When the mass has cooled,\r\nwash it into a half liter graduated flask, fill to the mark, and shake\r\nwell. After filtration, the clear filtrate may, after some time,\r\nturn turbid by separation of calcium sulfate, but as the ammonium\r\ncitrate, which is afterwards added, again brings the precipitate into\r\nsolution, it is of no importance. Take fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe solution, corresponding to one gram of the powdered sample, add\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of the citric acid solution, neutralize the\r\nmixture approximately, but not exactly, by ammonia; after cooling,\r\nadd twenty-five cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture; stir the fluid\r\nby means of a feather, as described above, till no more precipitate\r\nis formed, and finally add thirty-three cubic centimeters of ammonia\r\nwhile stirring for a couple of minutes more; after half an hour the\r\nprecipitate may be separated by filtration, washed, and ignited, as\r\nusually directed.\r\n\r\nThe above process is essentially the one used with basic slags. When\r\nmuch organic matter is present, by continuing the heating with sulfuric\r\nacid for some time, it may be destroyed.\r\n\r\n=66. Methods Adopted by the Brussels Congress, 1894.=—The report of\r\nthe committee on methods of analysis of phosphoric acid requires the\r\nmolybdate method to be used in all cases where the quantity to be\r\ndetermined is very small. In other cases the citrate method may be\r\nemployed.[58]\r\n\r\n(1) _Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—The soluble phosphoric acid is\r\ndetermined by the method adopted at Brussels in the following manner:\r\nFive grams of the sample are rubbed to a powder in a mortar, and then\r\nfrom fifty to sixty cubic centimeters of water added. After allowing\r\nto settle for a few minutes the liquid portion is decanted upon a\r\nfilter. This operation is repeated three or four times. Finally the\r\nsolid portions are washed upon the filter, and the washing with water\r\nis continued until the filtrate amounts to about three-quarters of a\r\nliter. A few drops of hydrochloric acid are added until the filtrate\r\nis perfectly clear, and the volume is then made up to one liter. Fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution are then treated with thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonium citrate solution and one-third as much ammonia.\r\nAfterwards thirty cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture are added, drop\r\nby drop, with constant stirring.\r\n\r\nFor superphosphates containing more than eighteen per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid only one gram is taken, for ordinary superphosphates\r\ntwo grams, and for compound fertilizers four grams. The sample is first\r\ntreated as above for soluble acid until the filtrate amounts to 200\r\ncubic centimeters, then clarified with a drop of nitric acid, and made\r\nup to a quarter of a liter.\r\n\r\n(2) _Reverted Phosphoric Acid._—The filter containing the residue\r\nis then introduced into a quarter liter flask and treated with 100\r\ncubic centimeters of Petermann’s alkaline ammonium citrate solution,\r\nvigorously shaken, and left at room temperature for fifteen hours.\r\nIt is then digested for an hour at 40° and filtered. Fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate are placed in a flask and, with constant\r\nshaking, thirty-five cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture added.\r\nThe aqueous solution is treated in the same way. The precipitate is\r\ncollected, ignited and weighed, and multiplied by 0.64 for phosphoric\r\nacid. The total acid is determined in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=67. Dutch Method for Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=[59]—The\r\nreagents necessary are:\r\n\r\n(1) Citrate solution, prepared according to Petermann. Dissolve 165\r\ngrams of citric acid in 700 cubic centimeters of water, mix with 250\r\ncubic centimeters of ammonia of 0.92 specific gravity, and, after\r\ncooling, bring to the volume of one liter.\r\n\r\n(2) Magnesia mixture prepared according to Petermann. Dissolve 400\r\ngrams of crystallized magnesium chlorid, 800 grams of ammonium chlorid,\r\nand 1,600 cubic centimeters of ammonia of 0.96 specific gravity in\r\nwater, and dilute to five liters.\r\n\r\nThe quantity to be taken for the analysis is five grams where the\r\nfertilizer contains less than six per cent of phosphoric acid (mixed\r\nfertilizers); two grams where it contains more than six and less than\r\nfifteen per cent (common superphosphates); and one gram where it\r\ncontains more than fifteen per cent (double superphosphates). Place\r\nthe weighed substance in a mortar and cover with 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof citrate solution. Gently rub up, wash into a half liter flask, and\r\nheat in a water-bath for an hour to a temperature between 35° and 38°.\r\nAllow to cool, fill up to 500 cubic centimeters, and filter through a\r\ndry double filter. If it is not clear at the first filtration, pour\r\nthrough the filter again, repeating this till clearness is attained.\r\nMeasure 100 cubic centimeters and add seventy-five cubic centimeters\r\nof magnesia mixture, allowing the latter to flow into the former very\r\nslowly, and constantly stirring during the influx. Allow to stand\r\nfifteen hours, filter, wash with ammonia of 0.96 specific gravity, dry,\r\nignite, and weigh.\r\n\r\nThe per cent of phosphoric acid, except where otherwise indicated, is\r\nalways to be given as per cent of anhydrous acid (P₂O₅).\r\n\r\n=68. Comparative Accuracy of the Citrate and Molybdate Methods.=—The\r\ngeneral use of the citrate method of determining phosphoric acid\r\nby the German chemists has led Johnson[60] to review some trials\r\nof that method in the Yale laboratory made as early as 1880. These\r\ndeterminations have lately been repeated in comparison with the\r\nordinary molybdate methods with the result that in sixty-seven\r\ndeterminations on bone-dust, superphosphate, cotton-hull ashes,\r\ncottonseed-meal, tankage, bone-char, phosphatic guano, and phosphate\r\nrock, only three citrate results differed from those obtained by\r\nthe molybdate method by more than three-tenths of one per cent. The\r\ngreatest discrepancy between the two methods was 0.41 per cent, and the\r\naverage difference was 0.09 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe citrate method was found to give poor results when iron and alumina\r\nwere present in considerable quantity. Ignited precipitates by the\r\ncitrate method were found to contain as high as four per cent of\r\nlime, and iron and alumina in small quantities when these bodies were\r\nabundant in the original substance.\r\n\r\nIn the molybdate method the rapid precipitation from solutions at 65°\r\nwas found to give unsatisfactory results and it was found necessary\r\nto conduct the process at temperatures between 40° and 50°. With a\r\nrelative excess of nitric or a relative deficiency of molybdic acid\r\nsome phosphoric acid may easily escape precipitation. The chief\r\nobjection to precipitating at 65° is found in the fact that in presence\r\nof considerable iron and alumina some of these bodies may be found\r\nin the yellow precipitate, whence they pass to the final ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate.\r\n\r\nThe citrate method, therefore, only gives safe results by compensating\r\nerrors which in every class of phosphates must be empirically\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe molybdate method gives results too high when iron and alumina are\r\npresent in considerable quantity and the yellow precipitate is obtained\r\nat temperatures above 50°. On the other hand, if there, be a great\r\nrelative excess of nitric acid the results may be too low unless the\r\nfiltrates from the yellow precipitate be mixed with additional molybdic\r\nsolution and digested until no further precipitate is formed.\r\n\r\nComparative determinations made, by both methods, by the Association of\r\nGerman Experiment Stations have led to the conclusion that both give\r\npractically the same results when each one is conducted with the proper\r\nprecautions peculiar to it.[61] In the latter part of 1892, at the\r\ngeneral meeting of the Association, it was declared that the citrate\r\nmethod, after having been subjected to repeated tests, was found to\r\nbe satisfactory, changing the composition of the solution so that it\r\nmight have 1,100 instead of 1,000 grams of citric acid and four liters\r\nof twenty-four per cent ammonia to each ten liters. The data afforded\r\nby the citrate method, when applied to an artificial mixture of known\r\ncomposition, were more satisfactory than those obtained by the molybdic\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the citrate method has been found to give nearly\r\nagreeing results with the old process. It is much shorter and less\r\nexpensive; and is recommended most favorably for practical use,\r\nsuggesting, however, that with every new kind of phosphate or\r\nphosphatic fertilizer varying notably in composition from the standard,\r\nthe work should be checked at first by comparison with the molybdenum\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC PHOSPHATIC SLAGS.\r\n\r\n=69. History and Manufacture.=—The basic process for the manufacture of\r\nBessemer steel is known in Europe as the Thomas or Thomas and Gilchrist\r\nprocess, and the slags rich in phosphate, one of the waste products\r\nof the process, are known by the same name. In this country all the\r\nphosphatic slags which have been made in the manufacture of steel have\r\nbeen obtained working under the patents of Reese, and, when prepared\r\nfor the market, are known as odorless phosphate. The only place where\r\nthese slags have been made in this country is Pottstown, Pennsylvania.\r\nIn Europe they are extensively manufactured, in England, France, and\r\nGermany, and their use for agricultural purposes has increased until it\r\nis quite equal to that of superphosphates.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of basic slag manufactured in Germany in 1893 was\r\n750,000 tons; in England 160,000; in France 115,000, making the total\r\nproduction of central Europe about 1,000,000, a quantity sufficient to\r\nfertilize nearly 5,000,000 acres.\r\n\r\n=70. Process of Manufacture.=—The principle of the process depends upon\r\nthe arrangement of the furnaces, by means of which the phosphoric acid\r\nin the pig iron is caused to combine with the lime which is used as a\r\nflux in the converters. A general outline of the process is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe pigs, which contain from two to four per cent of phosphorus, are\r\nmelted and introduced into a Bessemer converter lined with dolomite\r\npowder cemented with coal-tar, into which has previously been placed\r\na certain quantity of freshly-burned lime. For an average content of\r\nthree per cent of phosphorus in the pig iron, from fifteen to twenty\r\npounds of lime are used for each 100 pounds of pig iron. As soon as the\r\nmelted pig iron has been introduced into the converter, the air-blast\r\nis started, the converter placed in an upright position, and the\r\npurification of the mass begins. The manganese in the iron is converted\r\ninto oxid, the silicon into silica, the carbon into carbon dioxid and\r\noxid, and the phosphorus into phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the oxidation processes, the whole mass suffers a rise of\r\ntemperature amounting in all to about 700° above the temperature of the\r\nmelted iron. At this temperature the lime which has been added, melts,\r\nand, in this melted state, combines with the phosphoric acid, and the\r\nliquid mass floats upon the top of the metallic portion, which has, by\r\nthis process, been converted into steel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the process, which occupies only about fifteen minutes, is\r\ncompleted, the fused slag is poured off into molds, allowed to cool,\r\nbroken up, and ground to a fine powder. For each five tons of steel\r\nwhich are made in this way, about one ton of basic slag is produced.\r\n\r\nIn another process, in order to make a slag richer in phosphoric\r\nacid, a lime is employed which contains a considerable percentage of\r\nphosphate. Although the slag thus produced is richer in phosphoric\r\nacid, it is doubtful whether it is any more available for plant growth\r\nthan that made in the usual way with lime free from phosphoric acid. In\r\nother words, when a basic slag is made with a lime free from phosphoric\r\nacid, nearly the whole of the phosphoric acid is combined as tetrabasic\r\ncalcium phosphate. On the other hand, when the lime employed contains\r\nsome of the ordinary mineral phosphate the basic slag produced becomes\r\na mixture of this mineral phosphate with the tetracalcium salt. The\r\nmineral phosphate is probably not rendered any more available than it\r\nwas before.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen from the above outline of the process of manufacture,\r\nthat basic slags can have a very widely divergent composition. When\r\nmade from pig iron poor in phosphorus, the slag will have a large\r\nexcess of uncombined lime and consequently the content of phosphoric\r\nacid will be low. When made from pigs rich in phosphorus there may\r\nbe a comparative deficiency of lime, and in this case the content of\r\nphosphoric acid would be unusually high.\r\n\r\nIt is found also that the content of iron in the slag varies widely. In\r\ngeneral, the greater the content of iron the harder the slag and the\r\nmore difficult to grind. If the pig iron contain sulfur, as is often\r\nthe case, this sulfur is found also in the slag in combination with the\r\nlime, either as a sulfid or sulfate.\r\n\r\nNo certain formula can therefore be assigned to basic slags and the\r\navailability of each one must be judged by its chemical composition.\r\n\r\n=71. Composition of Basic Slag.=—The slags produced by the method above\r\noutlined may be amorphous or crystalline. When large masses are slowly\r\ncooled the interior often discloses a crystalline composition. In some\r\nsamples analyzed in this laboratory the crystals were found to be of\r\ntwo forms; _viz._, acicular and tabular.[62] They had the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n                              CALCULATED PER CENTS AS\r\n                        CaO.  Fe₂O₃.  Al₂O₃.  MgO.  V₂O₂.  P₂O₅.  SiO₂.\r\n    Acicular crystals  42.69  20.98   3.71   0.49   0.18  27.06   4.96\r\n    Tabular crystals   53.61   9.64   0.91   0.08    ——   33.92   1.75\r\n\r\nThese data show that the two sets of crystals belong to two distinct\r\nmineral forms. The presence of vanadium in one of the samples is\r\nworthy of remark, and leads to the suggestion that in the slags made\r\nof phosphoriferous pigs may be found any of the rare metals which\r\nmay exist in the ores from which the pigs were made. The amorphous\r\nportions may have a widely varying composition and consequent content\r\nof phosphoric acid. In all good slags, however, whether in crystalline\r\nform or as amorphous powder, the lime and phosphoric acid will be found\r\ncombined as tetracalcium phosphate (Ca₄P₂O₉).\r\n\r\n=72. Molecular Structure of Tetracalcium Phosphate.=—Several theories\r\nhave been advanced in respect of the atomic arrangement of the elements\r\ncontained in a molecule of tetracalcium phosphate. It must be confessed\r\nthat so little is known concerning the reactions of this body as to\r\nmake theories of its constitution largely visionary. But the existence\r\nin definite crystalline form of this salt shows that it is not merely\r\nan intimate mechanical mixture, but a true molecular form. As a type of\r\nthe supposed arrangement of its particles the graphic formula proposed\r\nby Kormann may be consulted; _viz._,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe crystals of this salt, as may be seen by inspection of the\r\nanalytical data, contain other bodies than calcium, oxygen, and\r\nphosphorus. It would be of interest to push the investigation of their\r\nconstitution further and see if crystals of pure tetracalcium phosphate\r\ncould be obtained, and under what conditions they would be contaminated\r\nby other metallic oxids. Usually, by the color of the crystals, it will\r\nbe easy to determine something of the nature, if not the extent of the\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\n=73. Solubility of Phosphatic Slags.=—The high agricultural value of\r\nbasic slags led to an early study of their solubility in ammonium\r\ncitrate, citric acid, and other organic solutions. Even finely ground\r\nmineral phosphates and bones are soluble to some extent in ammonium\r\ncitrate, as was pointed out as long ago as 1882.[63] The most common\r\nsolvents used for basic slags are ammonium citrate and citric acid. The\r\nammonium citrate should be the same as that used for the determination\r\nof reverted phosphoric acid and the citric acid solution commonly\r\nused contains five grams in a hundred cubic centimeters. The slags of\r\ndifferent origin and even of different age vary greatly in respect of\r\nthe quantity of soluble matter they contain. It is believed, however,\r\nthat a very fair idea of the agricultural value of a slag may be\r\nobtained by determining its degree of solubility in one of the menstrua\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n=74. Separation by Sifting.=—The relative availability of a slag, as\r\nin the case of a mineral phosphate, is determined by the percentage\r\nof fine material it contains. Sieves of varying apertures are used\r\nto determine this percentage. A one-half millimeter or a one-quarter\r\nmillimeter circular aperture is best, and the percentage of the total\r\nmaterial passing through is determined. A method used in Germany\r\nconsists in sifting the slag in a sieve twenty centimeters in diameter\r\nthe meshes of which are from 0.14 to 0.17 millimeter square and which\r\nmeasure diagonally from 0.22 to 0.24 millimeter.\r\n\r\n=75. Solution of Phosphatic Slags.=—Sulfuric acid has been found to be\r\nan excellent solvent for basic slags preparatory to the determination\r\nof phosphoric acid. There is, however, no unanimity of opinion\r\nconcerning the best method or means of solution. Aqua regia and\r\nnitric acid are objected to because they may convert any phosphorus\r\nin combination with the iron into phosphoric acid and thus increase\r\nthe quantity present.[64] But iron phosphid is seldom or ever found\r\nin slags and therefore this objection is not always tenable. Sulfuric\r\nacid has also been deemed objectionable because the gypsum separated is\r\nlikely to carry with it some of the other substances to be determined.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid is also excluded by some from the list of solvents\r\nbecause it dissolves so many of the foreign elements in the slag and\r\nthus tends to complicate the subsequent determination, especially\r\nof magnesia. Further than this a hydrochloric acid solution is not\r\nsuited to the use of the citrate method now so commonly employed.\r\nWhen hydrochloric acid is used, moreover, the dissolved silica must\r\nbe removed and thus the time required for making a phosphoric acid\r\ndetermination is much increased.\r\n\r\nIf the sample be sufficiently fine the occlusion of undissolved\r\nphosphate particles by the gypsum formed when sulfuric acid is used\r\nis not to be feared and the disturbance of volume by the gypsum is\r\npretty nearly constant and can be allowed for. When five grams of slag\r\nare used the mean volume of gypsum in the solution is about two cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\n=76. Estimation of Total Acid.=—In the determination of total\r\nphosphoric acid in a slag, twenty-five cubic centimeters of the\r\nstrongest sulfuric acid are placed in an erlenmeyer having a wide\r\nneck, and with careful shaking five grams of the fine slag meal\r\ngradually added. The flask is heated over a naked flame until solution\r\nis complete. When the mass is cold it is washed into a quarter liter\r\nflask; again allowed to cool, filled with water to the mark, and two\r\ncubic centimeters of water corresponding to the volume of gypsum\r\nundissolved, are added, well mixed, and filtered. In fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate the phosphoric acid is determined by either\r\nthe molybdic or citrate methods already described.\r\n\r\n=77. Alternate Method.=—The following method may also be used: Ten\r\ngrams of the substance are heated with fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid until white vapors have been evolved for\r\nsome time. The operation lasts for about fifteen minutes and can be\r\ncarried on in a half liter flask or in a porcelain dish. Without\r\nregarding the undissolved material the volume of the liquid is now\r\nmade up to half a liter and filtered. The filtered liquid becomes\r\nturbid after some time through the separation of calcium sulfate, but\r\nthis turbidity should not be regarded. To fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe solution, corresponding to one gram of substance, twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of citric acid solution (500 grams citric acid to the\r\nliter) are added, and it is afterwards nearly neutralized by the\r\naddition of ten per cent ammonia and the liquid, which is warmed\r\nby this operation, cooled. There are now added twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the ordinary magnesium chlorid mixture and the solution\r\nstirred until turbidity is produced, one-third of its volume of ten per\r\ncent ammonia added, and again stirred for about a minute.\r\n\r\nInstead of the addition of the citric acid and ammonia the ammonium\r\ncitrate prepared as follows, may be added: 1,500 grams of citric acid\r\nare dissolved with water, made up to three liters and five liters of\r\ntwenty-four per cent ammonia and seven liters of water added. The rest\r\nof the operation is carried on in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n=78. Halle Method for Basic Slag.=—The total phosphoric acid is\r\nestimated at the Halle Station by the following process:[65]\r\n\r\nTen grams of the substance are moistened in a porcelain dish with a\r\nfew drops of water and about five cubic centimeters of a one to one\r\nsolution of sulfuric acid added, and after the mass has hardened,\r\nwhich takes place very soon, fifty cubic centimeters of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid are added and stirred with a glass rod until it is evenly\r\ndistributed throughout the whole mass. In stirring this mixture the\r\ngreatest care must be taken, otherwise the substance would remain\r\nattached to the sides of the dish, which during later heating would\r\ncause loss through spurting. The complete solution now takes place\r\nafter a few hours’ heating on a sand-bath. During the cooling the\r\njelly-like mass must be stirred with a glass rod, and after it is cool,\r\nby means of a washing-bottle, gently along the sides of the dish,\r\nwater is added, and when the mixture becomes hot it is again cooled\r\nand washed into a half liter flask, which is made up to the mark at a\r\ntemperature of 17°.5 and filtered. When the acid filtrate stands for\r\nsome time there is often a separation of gypsum which, however, does\r\nnot in any way influence the subsequent analysis, which is made in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate, representing one gram of the\r\noriginal substance, are placed in an erlenmeyer. In the case of double\r\nsuperphosphates which often contain large quantities of pyrophosphates,\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate just obtained, equivalent\r\nto five grams of the substance, are diluted with seventy-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, ten cubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.42\r\nspecific gravity added, and heated on a sand-bath to convert the pyro\r\ninto orthophosphates. The heating should be continued until the liquid\r\nis reduced to its original volume of twenty-five cubic centimeters. The\r\nstrongly acid liquid is saturated with ammonia and with the addition\r\nof a drop of rosolic acid as an indicator, again acidified with nitric\r\nacid, and treated as with superphosphates.\r\n\r\n=79. Dutch Method for Basic Slag.=—Heat ten grams of the sample with\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid (1.84 specific gravity)\r\ntill white vapors are evolved, shaking or stirring constantly. After\r\ncooling make the fluid up to 500 cubic centimeters with water, taking\r\nno account of the undissolved substance. Filter, and to fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate add 100 cubic centimeters of the ammoniacal\r\ncitrate solution, and after cooling, twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\nmagnesia mixture. Stir or shake for a sufficient time. After the lapse\r\nof two hours the precipitate is to be separated by filtration and\r\ntreated in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n=80. Estimation of Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid in Basic\r\nSlag.=—Experience has shown that the manurial value of basic slags\r\ndoes not depend alone on their content of phosphoric acid. Slags may\r\ncontain tri- as well as tetracalcium phosphate, and even this latter\r\nsalt may exist in states of differing availability. In determining the\r\navailability of basic slag for manurial purposes its solubility in\r\nammonium citrate is considered the best standard. But this solubility\r\nwill evidently be influenced by the basicity of the sample, or in other\r\nwords, by the quantity of lime present. A slag rich in calcium oxid\r\nwould deport itself differently with a given ammonium citrate solution\r\nfrom one in which the lime had been chiefly converted into carbonate.\r\nIf possible, therefore, all samples should be reduced to the same state\r\nof basicity before the action of any given solvent is determined.\r\n\r\nWagner proposes to neutralize the basicity of a slag in the following\r\nmanner:[66] Five grams of the slag are placed in a half liter flask\r\nwhich is then filled up to the mark with a one per cent solution\r\nof citric acid and shaken for half an hour. After filtering, fifty\r\ncubic centimeters are titrated with a standard soda solution using\r\nphenolphthalein as indicator. This gives the quantity of citric acid\r\nnecessary to neutralize the slag. To a second portion of five grams of\r\nthe sample in a half liter flask are added 200 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and enough five per cent citric acid solution to neutralize the\r\nlime and then 200 cubic centimeters of acid ammonium citrate made as\r\nindicated below. After filling to the mark with water it is shaken for\r\nhalf an hour and filtered. To fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nare added 100 cubic centimeters of molybdic solution and heated to 80°.\r\nAfter cooling, the precipitate is filtered and the phosphoric acid\r\nestimated in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe acid ammonium citrate solution used is made as follows: Dissolve\r\n160 grams of citric acid with enough ammonia to represent about\r\ntwenty-eight grams of nitrogen and make up with water to one liter. The\r\nexact method is given in =82=.\r\n\r\nThe molybdic solution is made by dissolving 125 grams of molybdic\r\nacid in a slight excess of two and a half per cent of ammonia, adding\r\n400 grams of ammonium nitrate, diluting to one liter and pouring the\r\nsolution into one liter of nitric acid having a specific gravity of\r\n1.19. After allowing to stand at room temperature for one day the\r\nmixture is filtered and is then ready for use.\r\n\r\n=81. Wagner’s Shaking Apparatus.=—The latest directions given by\r\nWagner for determining the phosphoric acid in slags and raw phosphates\r\nsoluble in citrate solutions, are the following:[67] Five grams of\r\nthe material as it is sent into commerce without grinding or sifting,\r\nare placed in a half liter flask and covered with nearly a quarter\r\nliter of water, and then 200 cubic centimeters of citrate solution\r\nadded, prepared as described below. The flask is filled to the mark\r\nwith water. The flasks, which are of the shape shown in the figure,\r\nare closed with rubber stoppers, and without delay placed for half an\r\nhour in a rotating apparatus, (Fig. 6) which is turned on its axis from\r\nthirty to forty times a minute. If a shaking apparatus be used instead\r\nof the one mentioned, 200 cubic centimeters of the citrate solution\r\nshould be placed in a half liter flask, filled to the mark with water,\r\nand the contents poured into a liter flask containing the phosphate.\r\nThis flask should be placed in a nearly horizontal position in the\r\napparatus and the agitation be continued for half an hour. On removal\r\nfrom the apparatus the mixture is filtered and fifty cubic centimeters\r\nthereof treated with double the quantity of molybdic solution at\r\n80° and the precipitate separated after cooling. The precipitate is\r\ncarefully washed with one per cent nitric acid mixture, after which\r\nthe filter is broken and the precipitate washed into a beaker with two\r\nper cent ammonia and the filter washed therewith until about 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters have been used. If the solution is turbid from the presence\r\nof silicic acid it should be precipitated a second time by addition of\r\nmolybdic solution until the acid reaction is restored. The ammoniacal\r\nsolution of the yellow precipitate is treated, drop by drop, with\r\nconstant stirring, with fifteen cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture,\r\nand set aside for two hours. The precipitate is collected, washed,\r\nignited, and weighed in the usual manner. The direct precipitation of\r\nthe phosphoric acid by the magnesia solution in presence of citrate is\r\nnot advisable because of the almost general presence of silicic acid\r\nwhich would cause the results to be too high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.\r\n\r\nWAGNER’S DIGESTION APPARATUS FOR SLAGS.]\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to this method of Wagner lies in the failure to\r\ncontrol the temperature at which the digestion with citrate solution\r\nis made. Huston has shown, as will be described further on, that the\r\ntemperature exercises a great influence in digestion with citrate.\r\nSince the laboratory temperature, especially in this country, may vary\r\nbetween 10° and 35°, it is evident that on the same sample the Wagner\r\nmethod would give very discordant results at different seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n=82. Solutions Employed in the Wagner Method.=—1. _Ammonium\r\nCitrate._—In one liter there should be exactly 150 grams of citric\r\nacid and 27.93 grams of ammonia, equivalent to twenty-three grams of\r\nnitrogen. The following example illustrates the preparation of ten\r\nliters of the solution: In two liters of water and three and a half\r\nliters of eight per cent ammonia, 1,500 grams of citric acid are\r\ndissolved and the cooled solution made up exactly to eight liters.\r\nDilute twenty-five cubic centimeters of this solution to 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters and treat twenty-five cubic centimeters of this with three\r\ngrams of calcined magnesia and distill into forty cubic centimeters\r\nof half normal sulfuric acid. Suppose the ammonia nitrogen found\r\ncorrespond to twenty cubic centimeters of fourth normal soda-lye. Then\r\nin the eight liters are contained\r\n\r\n    (20.0 × 0.0035 × 8000)\r\n    ---------------------- = 224 grams\r\n             2.5\r\n\r\nof ammonia nitrogen. Then in order to secure in the ten liters the\r\nproper quantity of ammonia there must be added two liters of water\r\ncontaining 230 - 224 = six grams of nitrogen or seven and three-tenths\r\ngrams ammonia; _viz._, ninety-four cubic centimeters of 0.967 specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n2. _Molybdate Solution._—Dissolve 125 grams of molybdic acid in dilute\r\ntwo and five-tenths per cent ammonia, avoiding a large excess of the\r\nsolvent. Add 400 grams of ammonium nitrate, dilute with water to one\r\nliter and pour the solution into one liter of nitric acid of 1.19\r\nspecific gravity. Allow the preparation to stand for twenty-four hours\r\nat 35° and filter.\r\n\r\n3. _Magnesia Mixture._—Dissolve 110 grams of pure crystallized\r\nmagnesium chlorid and 140 grams of ammonium chlorid in 700 cubic\r\ncentimeters of eight per cent ammonia and 130 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater. Allow to stand several days and filter.\r\n\r\n=83. Estimation of Lime.=—When the lime is to be determined in basic\r\nslags some difficulty may be experienced by reason of danger of\r\ncontamination of the oxalate precipitate with iron and especially\r\nmanganese, which is often present in slags.\r\n\r\nHolleman[68] proposes to estimate the lime in basic slag by a\r\nmodification of the methods of Classen and Jones. The manipulation is\r\nas follows: Fifty cubic centimeters of the solution of slag, equivalent\r\nto one gram of substance, are evaporated to a small volume, twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of neutral ammonium oxalate solution (one to three)\r\nadded to the residue and heated on a water-bath with frequent stirring,\r\nuntil the precipitate is pure white and free from lumps. The time\r\nrequired is usually about ten minutes. The precipitate is collected\r\non a filter and washed with hot water until the filtrate contains no\r\noxalic acid. The precipitated calcium oxalate must be snow-white. The\r\nfilter is broken and the calcium oxalate washed through, first with\r\nwater and finally with warm, dilute hydrochloric acid (one to one).\r\nThe calcium oxalate is dissolved by adding fifteen cubic centimeters\r\nof concentrated hydrochloric acid, the solution evaporated to a volume\r\nof about twenty-five cubic centimeters and ten cubic centimeters of\r\ndilute sulfuric acid (one to five), and 150 cubic centimeters of\r\nninety-six per cent alcohol added. After standing three hours or more\r\nthe precipitate is separated by filtration and washed with ninety-six\r\nper cent alcohol until the washings show no acid reaction with methyl\r\norange. The calcium sulfate precipitated is dried to constant weight.\r\nThis method gives a pure precipitate of calcium sulfate, containing\r\nonly traces of manganese.\r\n\r\n=84. Estimation of Caustic Lime.=—The lime mechanically present in\r\nbasic slags is likely to be found as oxid or hydroxid, especially when\r\nthe sample is of recent manufacture. In the form of oxid the lime may\r\nbe determined by solution in sugar. In this process one gram of the\r\nfine slag meal is shaken for some time with a solution of sugar, as\r\nsuggested by Stone and Scheuch.[69] The dissolved lime is separated\r\nas oxalate by treatment of the solution with the ammonium salt. The\r\ncalcium oxalate may be determined by ignition in the usual way or\r\nvolumetrically by solution in sulfuric acid and titration of the\r\nfree oxalic acid with potassium permanganate solutions. The standard\r\nsolution of permanganate should be of such a strength as to have one\r\ncubic centimeter equivalent to about 0.01 gram of iron. The iron value\r\nof the permanganate used multiplied by 0.5 will give the quantity of\r\ncalcium oxid found.\r\n\r\n=85. Detection of Adulteration of Phosphatic Slags.=—The high\r\nagricultural value of phosphatic slags has led to their adulteration\r\nand even to the substitution of other bodies. Several patents have also\r\nbeen granted for the manufacture of artificial slags of a value said to\r\nbe an approximation to that of the by-products of the basic pig iron\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n(1) _Method of Blum._—One of the earliest methods of examining\r\nbasic slag for adulterations is the method of Blum.[70] This method\r\nrests upon the principle of the determination of the carbon dioxid\r\nin the sample. The basic phosphatic slag is supposed to contain no\r\ncarbon dioxid. This is true only in case it is freshly prepared. The\r\ntetrabasic phosphate, after being kept for some time, gradually absorbs\r\ncarbon dioxid from the air. As high as nineteen per cent of carbon\r\ndioxid have been found in slags which have been kept for a long while.\r\nWhen the slag has absorbed so much of carbon dioxid and water from the\r\nair as to be no longer profitable for market, it can be restored to its\r\noriginal condition by ignition.\r\n\r\n(2) _Method of Richter-Forster._—One of the common adulterants of\r\ntetrabasic phosphate is aluminum phosphate. The method of detecting\r\nthis when mixed with the slag is described by Richter-Forster.[71]\r\nThe method depends on the fact that soda-lye dissolves the aluminum\r\nphosphate, although it does not dissolve any calcium phosphoric acid\r\nfrom the slag. Two grams of the sample to be tested are treated with\r\nten cubic centimeters of soda-lye of from 7° to 8° C. in a small vessel\r\nwith frequent shaking for a few hours at room temperature. After\r\nfiltration the filtrate is made acid with hydrochloric and afterwards\r\nslightly alkaline with ammonia. With pure basic slag there is a small\r\ntrace of precipitate produced, but this is due to a little silica which\r\ncan be dissolved in a slight excess of acetic acid. If, however, the\r\nbasic slag contain aluminum phosphate, a dense jelly-like precipitate\r\nof aluminum phosphate is produced.\r\n\r\n(3) _Method of Jensch._—Edmund Jensch[72] determines the tetrabasic\r\nphosphate in slags by solution in organic acids, and prefers citric\r\nacid for this purpose. This method was also recommended by Blum[73].\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the tetrabasic phosphate in slags is completely\r\nsoluble in citric acid while the tribasic phosphate is only slightly,\r\nif at all, attacked. The neutral ammonium salts of organic acids do\r\nnot at first attack the tribasic phosphate at all, and they do not\r\ncompletely dissolve the tetrabasic phosphate. The solution used by\r\nJensch is made as follows: Fifty grams of crystallized citric acid are\r\ndissolved in one liter of water. A weaker acid dissolves the tetrabasic\r\nphosphate too slowly and a stronger one attacks the tribasic phosphate\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nSchucht recommends the following method of procedure:[74] One gram\r\nof the slag, finely ground, is treated in a beaker glass with about\r\n150 cubic centimeters of Jensen’s citric acid solution and warmed for\r\ntwelve hours in an air-bath at from 50° to 70° with frequent shaking.\r\nAfterwards it is diluted with 100 cubic centimeters of water, boiled\r\nfor one minute and filtered. The filter is washed thoroughly with hot\r\nwater and the phosphoric acid is estimated in the filtrate in the usual\r\nway. With artificial mixtures of basic slags and other phosphates the\r\nquantity of basic slag can be determined by the above method.\r\n\r\n(4) _Method of Wrampelmeyer._—According to Wrampelmeyer the most\r\nconvenient method for discovering the adulteration of basic slag is the\r\nuse of the microscope.[75] All finely ground natural phosphates are\r\nlight colored and with a strong magnification appear as rounded masses.\r\nIn basic slags the particles are mostly black but there are often found\r\nred-colored fragments having sharp angles which refract their light\r\nin a peculiar way so that, with a very little experience, they can be\r\nrecognized as being distinctive marks of pure basic slag.\r\n\r\nIn artificial mixtures of these two phosphates, which we have made in\r\nour laboratory, we have been able to detect with certainty as little as\r\none per cent of added mineral phosphate.\r\n\r\nOne form of adulterating natural mineral phosphates has been mixing\r\nthem with finely pulverized charcoal or soot to give them the black\r\nappearance characteristic of the basic slags. This form of adulteration\r\nis at once disclosed by simple ignition or by microscopic examination.\r\n\r\n(5) _Loss on Ignition._—If all doubts cannot be removed by the use\r\nof the microscope, the loss on ignition should be estimated. Natural\r\nphosphates all give a high loss on ignition, ranging from eight to\r\ntwenty-four per cent, while a basic slag gives only a very slight loss\r\non ignition, especially when fresh. A basic slag which has stood for a\r\nlong while and absorbed carbon dioxid and moisture, may give a loss on\r\nignition approximating, in a maximum case, the minimum loss on ignition\r\nfrom a natural phosphate.\r\n\r\nIn experiments made in this laboratory in testing for loss on ignition,\r\nwe have uniformly found that natural mineral phosphates will lose from\r\nnearly one to two and one-half times as much on ignition as a basic\r\nslag which has been kept for two years. A basic slag in the laboratory\r\nmore than two years old gave, as loss on ignition, 4.12 per cent.\r\nSeveral samples of finely ground Florida phosphates gave the following\r\npercentages of loss on ignition, as compared with a sample of slag.\r\n\r\nOdorless phosphate 4.12.\r\n\r\nFlorida phosphates 8.06, 6.90, 9.58, 6.40, 10.38, and 10.67\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThere are some mineral phosphates, however, which are ignited before\r\nbeing sent to the market. We have one such sample in our laboratory\r\nfrom Florida which gave, on ignition, a loss of only one and\r\nfour-tenths per cent. In this case it is seen that the application of\r\nthe process of ignition would not discriminate between a basic slag and\r\na mineral phosphate.\r\n\r\nIt may often be of interest to know what part of the loss, on ignition,\r\nis due to water in form of moisture. In such cases the sample should\r\nfirst be dried to constant weight in a steam-bath and then ignited. In\r\nthe following data are found the results obtained here with samples\r\ntreated as above indicated and also ignited directly. Number one is a\r\nbasic slag two years old and the others Florida phosphates.\r\n\r\n                  Heated to 100° C. then ignited.   Ignited directly.\r\n\r\n                  Loss at    Loss on     Total          Loss on\r\n                  100° C.   ignition.    loss.         ignition.\r\n\r\n    No. 1 (Slag)  2.57        1.77       4.34            4.12\r\n    No. 2 (Rock)  2.61        5.19       7.80            8.06\r\n    No. 3   “     1.09        5.77       6.86            6.90\r\n    No. 4   “     0.42        9.20       9.62            9.58\r\n    No. 5   “     1.81        4.83       6.64            6.40\r\n    No. 6   “     4.36        6.52      10.88           10.83\r\n    No. 7   “     3.31        7.01      10.32           10.67\r\n\r\n(6) _Presence of Sulfids._—Another point noticed in this laboratory is\r\nthat the basic slags uniformly contain sulfids which are decomposed\r\nupon the addition of an acid with an evolution of hydrogen sulfid.\r\n\r\n(7) _Presence of Fluorin._—In applying the test for fluorin, it has\r\nbeen uniformly found here that the mineral phosphates respond to the\r\nfluorin test while the basic slags, on the contrary, respond to the\r\nhydrogen sulfid test. This test, however, was applied only to the few\r\nsamples we have had and may not be a uniform property.\r\n\r\nThe absence of fluorin might not prove the absence of adulteration,\r\nbut its presence would, I believe, certainly prove the fact of the\r\nadulteration in that particular sample.\r\n\r\nThe fluorin test is applied by Böttcher in the following manner:[76]\r\nFrom ten to fifteen grams of the slag are placed in a beaker ten\r\ncentimeters high and from five to six centimeters in diameter, with\r\nfifteen cubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid, stirred with a\r\nglass rod, and covered with a watch-glass on the under side of which a\r\ndrop of water hangs. If there be formed upon the drop of water a white\r\nmurky rim, it is proof that a mineral phosphate containing fluorin has\r\nbeen added. After from five to ten minutes you can notice on the clean\r\nwatch-glass the etching produced by the hydrofluoric acid. According to\r\nBöttcher an adulteration of ten per cent of raw phosphate in slag can\r\nbe detected by this method.\r\n\r\n(8) _Solubility in Water._—Solubility in water is also a good\r\nindication, natural phosphates being totally insoluble in water, while\r\na considerable quantity of the basic slag will be dissolved in water on\r\naccount of the calcium oxid or hydroxid which it contains. If the loss\r\non ignition is low, and the volume-weight and water-solubility high,\r\nthe analyst may be certain that the sample is a pure slag.\r\n\r\nIn comparative tests made in our laboratory with a sample of basic slag\r\nand seven samples of Florida phosphate, the percentages of material\r\ndissolved by water and by a five per cent solution of citric acid were\r\nfound to be as follows:\r\n\r\n                                              Sol. in five per cent\r\n                       Water-soluble.              citric acid.\r\n                         Per cent.                   Per cent.\r\n\r\n    Odorless phosphate     0.97                        16.10\r\n    Florida phosphate      0.01                         4.15\r\n       “        “          0.09                         4.66\r\n       “        “          0.02                         3.43\r\n       “        “          0.08                         3.61\r\n       “        “          0.02                         3.79\r\n       “        “          0.05                         4.46\r\n       “        “          0.02                         4.24\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the solvent action of water\r\nespecially would be of value inasmuch as it dissolves only a mere trace\r\nof the mineral phosphates, approximating one per cent of the amount\r\ndissolved from basic slag. In the case of the citric acid it is found\r\nthat the amount of materials soluble in this solvent for basic slag\r\nis fully four times as great as for the mineral phosphates. Both of\r\nthese processes, therefore, have considerable value for discriminating\r\nbetween the pure and adulterated article of basic slag.\r\n\r\n(9) _Specific Gravity._—The estimation of the volume specific gravity\r\nis also a good indication for judging of the purity of the slag. This\r\nis best done by weighing directly a given volume. Basic slag will have\r\na volume-weight of about one and nine-tenths, while natural phosphates\r\nwill have about one and six-tenths.\r\n\r\n(10) _Conclusions._—From the above résumé of the standard methods which\r\nare in use for determining the adulteration of basic slag, it is seen\r\nthat there are many cases in which grave doubt might exist even after\r\nthe careful application of all the methods mentioned. If we had only\r\nto consider the adulteration of basic slag with certain of the mineral\r\nphosphates, that is, tricalcium phosphate, the problem would be an easy\r\none, but when we add to this the fact that iron and aluminum phosphates\r\nare employed in the adulteration, and that artificial slags may be so\r\nused, the question becomes more involved.\r\n\r\nIn doubtful cases one after another of the methods should be applied\r\nuntil there is no doubt whatever of the judgment which should be\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUMETRIC DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID.\r\n\r\n=86. Classification of Methods.=—The time required for a gravimetric\r\ndetermination of phosphoric acid has led analysts to try the speedier\r\nif less accurate processes, depending on the use of volumetric methods.\r\nThe chief difficulty with these methods has been in securing some\r\nsharp method of distinguishing the end reaction. In most cases it has\r\nbeen found necessary to remove a portion of the titrated solution and\r\nprepare it for final testing by subsidence or filtration. As is well\r\nknown, this method of determining the end reaction is less accurate and\r\nmore time-consuming than those processes depending on a change of color\r\nin the whole mass. All the volumetric processes now in general use\r\nmay be divided into two classes; _viz._, (1) the direct precipitation\r\nof phosphoric acid and the determination of the end reaction by any\r\nappropriate means, and (2) the previous separation of the phosphoric\r\nacid, usually by means of a citro-magnesium or molybdenum mixture, and\r\nin the latter case the subsequent titration of the yellow ammonium\r\nphosphomolybdate either directly or after reduction to a lower form\r\nof oxidation. In respect of extent of application by far the most\r\nimportant volumetric method is the one depending on titration by\r\na uranium salt after previous separation by ammoniacal magnesium\r\ncitrate. A promising method after previous separation by molybdenum is\r\nthe one proposed by Pemberton, but it has not yet come into general\r\nuse. For small quantities of phosphoric acid or of phosphorus, such\r\nas are found in steels and irons, the method of Emmerton, either as\r\noriginally proposed or as modified by Dudley and Noyes, is in frequent\r\nuse. Where volumetric methods are applied to products separated by\r\nmolybdic solution, the essential feature of the analytical work is to\r\nsecure a yellow precipitate of constant composition. If this could\r\nbe uniformly done such methods would rival the gravimetric processes\r\nin accuracy. Hence it is highly important in these methods that the\r\nyellow precipitate should be secured as far as possible, under constant\r\nconditions of strength of solution, duration of time, and manner of\r\nprecipitation. In these cases, and in such only, can the quicker\r\nvolumetric methods be depended on for accurate results.\r\n\r\nThe direct volumetric precipitation of the phosphoric acid by a uranium\r\nsalt or otherwise is practiced only when the acid is combined with the\r\nalkalies and when iron and alumina are absent and only small quantities\r\nof lime present. This method has therefore but little practical value\r\nfor agricultural purposes. In all volumetric analyses the accuracy of\r\nthe burettes, pipettes, and other graduated vessels should be proved by\r\ncareful calibration. Many of the disagreements in laboratories where\r\nthe analytical work is conducted equally well can be due to no other\r\ncause than the inaccuracy of the graduated vessels which are found in\r\ncommerce. Burettes should not only be calibrated for the whole volume\r\nbut for at least every five cubic centimeters of the graduation.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANIUM METHOD AS PRACTICED BY THE FRENCH CHEMISTS.\r\n\r\n=87. The Uranium Method.=—Since the phosphoric acid of practical use\r\nfor agricultural purposes is nearly always combined with lime, alumina,\r\nand iron, its volumetric estimation by means of a standard solution of\r\na uranium salt is to be preceded by a preliminary separation by means\r\nof an ammoniacal magnesium citrate solution. The principle of the\r\nmethod was almost simultaneously published by Sutton,[77] Neubauer,[78]\r\nand Pincus.[79] The phosphoric acid may also be separated by means of\r\nmolybdic solution or by tin or bismuth.[80] In practice, however, it\r\nhas been found that when the uranium method is to be used the magnesium\r\ncitrate separation is the most convenient. Since this is the method\r\npracticed almost universally in France, the method there used will be\r\ngiven in detail. It is based essentially on the process described by\r\nJoulie.[81]\r\n\r\n=88. Preparation of Sample.=—(1) _Incineration._—Since the organic\r\nmatters present in a phosphatic fertilizer often interfere with the\r\nemployment of uranium as a reagent, it is necessary to incinerate the\r\nsample taken for analysis.[82]\r\n\r\n(2) _Solution of the Material._—All phosphates, with the exception\r\nof certain aluminum phosphates, amblygonite for example, are easily\r\ndissolved in nitric and hydrochloric acids more or less dilute,\r\nespecially on ebullition. The best solvent, however, for calcium\r\nphosphates for the uranium method is incontestably hydrochloric acid\r\nwhich also very easily dissolves the iron and aluminum phosphates,\r\nwhich are often found present with calcium phosphates.\r\n\r\n(3) _Nitric Acid._—In many laboratories nitric acid is preferred in\r\norder to avoid, in part, the solution of ferric oxid which interferes\r\nwith the determination of phosphoric acid in certain processes. Since\r\nit does not act in this way for the citro-magnesium uranium method,\r\nit is preferable to employ hydrochloric acid, especially because it\r\ndissolves the iron completely and permits thus the operator to judge of\r\nthe success of the solvent action by the completely white color of the\r\nresidue.\r\n\r\n(4) _Pyritic Phosphates._—Certain phosphates contain pyrites which\r\nhydrochloric acid does not dissolve, and there is left consequently,\r\na residue more or less colored. In this case it is necessary to add\r\nsome nitric acid and to prolong the boiling until the pyrite has\r\ndisappeared, since it might retain a small quantity of phosphoric acid\r\nin the state of iron phosphate.\r\n\r\n(5) _Sulfuric Acid._—Some chemists decompose the phosphates by means\r\nof dilute sulfuric acid. This method, which is certainly able to give\r\ngood results for certain products and for certain processes, presents\r\nnumerous inconveniences which tend to render its use objectionable for\r\nvolumetric purposes. The calcium sulfate which is formed, requires\r\nprolonged washings which lead to chances of fatal error.\r\n\r\nIf an aluminum phosphate be under examination, containing only very\r\nlittle or no lime, sulfuric acid is to be preferred to hydrochloric and\r\nnitric acids, since it attacks amblygonite, which, as has been before\r\nstated, resists the action of the other two acids. But these are cases\r\nwhich are met with very rarely, and which can always be treated by the\r\ngeneral method by previously fusing the material with a mixture of\r\nsodium and potassium carbonate.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of cases the decomposition by hydrochloric acid\r\nis very easily accomplished by simply boiling in a glass vessel, and\r\nwithout effecting the separation of the silica. This operation is only\r\nnecessary after the substance has been fused with alkaline carbonates,\r\nor, in case of substances which contain decomposable silicates giving\r\ngelatinous silica with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods [see (6) and (7)] of securing a solution of\r\nthe sample taken which varies from one to five, and even ten grams,\r\naccording to the apparent homogeneity of the material to be analyzed.\r\n\r\n(6) _Solution by Filtration and Washing._—The ordinary method can\r\nbe employed consisting in decomposing the substance by an acid,\r\nfiltering, and washing the residue upon the filter, and combining all\r\nthe wash-waters to make a determinate volume. Afterwards an aliquot\r\nfraction of the whole is taken for the precipitation. This method is\r\nlong, and presents some chances of error, when the insoluble residue is\r\nvoluminous and contains silica which obstructs the pores of the paper\r\nand renders the filtration difficult.\r\n\r\n(7) _Volumetric Solution._—It is advisable to substitute volumetric\r\nsolution for solution by filtration and washing, which is accomplished\r\nby decomposing the substances in a graduated flask, the volume being\r\nafterwards made up to the mark with distilled water after cooling. The\r\nsolution is then filtered without washing, and by means of a pipette an\r\naliquot part of the original volume is taken for precipitation. Thus\r\nall retardations in the process are avoided, and likewise the chances\r\nof error from washing on the filter. It is true that this method may\r\nlead to a certain error due to the volume of the insoluble matter\r\nwhich is left undecomposed, but since this insoluble matter is usually\r\nsmall in quantity, and since it is always possible to diminish the\r\nerror therefrom by increasing the volume of the solution, this cause\r\nof error is much less to be feared than those due to the difficulties\r\nwhich may occur in the other method. Let us suppose, in order to\r\nillustrate the above, that we are dealing with a phosphate containing\r\nfifty per cent of insoluble sand which may be considered as an extreme\r\nlimit. In working on four grams of the material in a flask of 100\r\ncubic centimeters capacity, there will be an insoluble residue of two\r\ngrams occupying a volume of about one cubic centimeter, the density of\r\nthe sand being generally nearly two. The one hundred cubic centimeter\r\nflask will then contain only ninety-nine cubic centimeters of the real\r\nsolution, and the error at the most would be 0.01. This error could be\r\nreduced to one-half by dissolving only two grams of the material in\r\nplace of four, or by making the volume up to 200 instead of 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the errors which do not exceed 0.01 of\r\nthe total matter under treatment, are negligible for all industrial\r\nproducts. The method of volumetric solution does not present any\r\nfurther inconvenience. It deserves to be and has been generally adopted\r\nby reason of its rapidity in all the laboratories where many analyses\r\nare to be made. In the volumetric method great care should be taken not\r\nto make up to the volume until after the cooling to room temperature,\r\nwhich may be speedily secured by immersing the flask in cold water.\r\nCare should also be exercised in taking the sample for analysis by\r\nmeans of the pipette immediately after filtration, and filtration\r\nshould take place as soon as the volume is made up to the standard. By\r\noperating in this way the possible variations from changes of volume\r\ndue to changes of temperature are avoided.\r\n\r\n(8) _Examination for Arsenic Acid._—When the sample examined contains\r\npyrites, arsenic is often present. When the decomposition has been\r\neffected by means of nitric acid, arsenic acid may be produced. This\r\ndeports itself in all circumstances like phosphoric acid, and if it is\r\npresent in the matter under examination it will be found united with\r\nthe phosphoric acid and determined therewith afterwards. It is easy\r\nto avoid this cause of error by passing first a current of sulfurous\r\nacid through the solution, carrying it to the boiling-point in order to\r\ndrive out the excess of sulfurous acid, and afterwards precipitating\r\nthe arsenic by a current of hydrogen sulfid. After filtration, the rest\r\nof the operation can be carried on as already described.\r\n\r\n=89. Precipitation of the Phosphate by Magnesium Citrate.=—By means of\r\nan accurate pipette a quantity of the solution representing from 0.125\r\nto 0.250 gram or more is taken, according to the presumed richness of\r\nthe product to be examined. In order that the following operations\r\nmay go on well, it is necessary that the quantity of phosphoric acid\r\ncontained in the sample should be about fifty milligrams. The sample\r\nbeing measured is run into a beaker, and there are added, first, ten\r\ncubic centimeters of magnesium citrate solution, and second, a large\r\nexcess of ammonia. If the quantity of the magnesium citrate solution\r\nbe sufficient, the mixture should at first remain perfectly limpid and\r\nonly become turbid at the end of some moments and especially after the\r\nmixture is stirred.\r\n\r\nIf there should be an immediate turbidity produced it is proof that the\r\nquantity of magnesium citrate solution employed has been insufficient,\r\nand it is necessary to begin again by doubling its amount. Good results\r\ncannot be obtained by adding a second portion of the magnesium citrate\r\nsolution to the original, since the iron and aluminum phosphates which\r\nare once formed are redissolved with difficulty. Many chemists at the\r\npresent time abstain from using the magnesium citrate solution and\r\nreplace it by a solution of citric acid and one of magnesium sulfate,\r\nwhich they pour successively into the sample under examination. This\r\nis a cause of grave errors which it is necessary to point out. Joulie\r\nhas indeed recognized the fact that the precipitation of the phosphoric\r\nacid is not completed in presence of ammonium citrate except it is\r\nemployed in conjunction with a sufficient excess of magnesia. But the\r\nforeign matters which accompany the phosphoric acid require different\r\nquantities of ammonium citrate in order to keep them in solution, and\r\nit is important to increase the magnesium solution at the time of\r\nincreasing the citric acid in order to maintain them always in the same\r\nproportion. This is easily accomplished by measuring the two solutions,\r\nbut it is much more easily done by uniting them and adding them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n=90. The Magnesium Citrate Solution.=—The formula originally proposed\r\nby Joulie, and modified by Millot, and adopted by the French\r\nAssociation of Chemists, is as follows: Citric acid, 400 grams; pure\r\nmagnesium carbonate, forty grams; caustic magnesia, twenty grams;\r\ndistilled water, half a liter. After solution, add enough of ammonia\r\nto render strongly alkaline, requiring about 600 cubic centimeters.\r\nMake the volume up with distilled water to one and a half liters. If\r\nthe solution be turbid, it is proof that the magnesia or the carbonate\r\nemployed contains some phosphoric acid which is to be separated by\r\nfiltration, and the solution can then be preserved indefinitely.\r\n\r\n=91. Time of Subsidence.=—When the phosphoric acid is precipitated by\r\nthe mixture above mentioned, it is necessary to allow it to subside for\r\na certain time under a bell jar in order to avoid the evaporation of\r\nthe ammonia. In order to give plenty of time for this subsidence, it is\r\nwell to make the precipitations in the afternoon and the filtrations\r\nthe following morning. There are thus secured twelve to fifteen hours\r\nof repose, which is time amply sufficient for all cases.\r\n\r\n=92. Filtration and Washing.=—Filtration is performed easily and\r\nrapidly upon a small filter without folds placed in a funnel with a\r\nlong stem of about two millimeters internal diameter. Placed in a\r\nseries of six or eight, they allow the filtration to take place in\r\nregular order without loss of time, the first filter being always\r\nempty by the time the last one is filled. The supernatant liquid from\r\nthe precipitate should first be decanted on the filter, avoiding the\r\nthrowing of the filtrate on the filter which would greatly retard the\r\nprocess, especially if it should contain a little silica, as often\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\nWhen the clear liquid is thus decanted as completely as possible, the\r\nrest of the precipitate is treated with water to which one-tenth of\r\nits volume of ammonia has been added, and the washing is continued by\r\ndecantation as at first, and afterwards by washing upon the filter\r\nuntil the filtered solution gives no precipitate with sodium phosphate.\r\nFour washings are generally sufficient to attain this result.\r\n\r\nIf the operations which precede have been well-conducted, the total\r\nphosphoric acid contained in the material under examination is\r\nfound upon the filter-paper, except the small portion which remains\r\nadhering to the beaker in which the precipitation has been made.\r\nThe determination of the phosphoric acid comprises the following\r\noperations: First, solution of the ammonium magnesium phosphate and\r\nsecond, titration by means of a standard solution of uranium.\r\n\r\n=93. Solution of the Ammonium Magnesium Phosphate.=—The phosphate which\r\nhas been collected upon the filter is dissolved by a ten per cent\r\nsolution of pure nitric acid. This solution is caused to pass into\r\nthe beaker in which the precipitation was made in order to dissolve\r\nthe particles of phosphate which remain adherent to its sides; and\r\nthis solution is then thrown upon the filter. The filtrate is then\r\nreceived in a flask of about 150 cubic centimeters capacity, marked at\r\nseventy-five cubic centimeters. After two or three washings with the\r\nacidulated water, the filter itself is detached from the funnel and\r\nintroduced into the vessel which contains the solution.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the filtrate being collected in the flask it is saturated\r\nby one-tenth ammoniacal water until a slight turbidity is produced.\r\nOne or two drops of dilute nitric acid are now added until the liquor\r\nbecomes limpid, and the flask is placed upon a sand-bath in order to\r\ncarry the liquid to the boiling-point. After ebullition there are added\r\nfive cubic centimeters of acid sodium acetate in order to cause the\r\nfree nitric acid to disappear and immediately the titration, by means\r\nof a standard solution of uranium, is undertaken.\r\n\r\n=94. Acid Sodium Acetate.=—The acid sodium acetate is prepared as\r\nfollows: Crystallized sodium acetate, 100 grams; glacial acetic acid,\r\nfifty cubic centimeters; distilled water, enough to make one liter.\r\n\r\n=95. Standard Solution of Uranium.=—A solution of uranium is to be\r\nprepared as follows: Pure uranium nitrate, forty grams; distilled\r\nwater, about 800 cubic centimeters. Dissolve the uranium nitrate in the\r\ndistilled water and add a few drops of ammonia until a slight turbidity\r\nis produced, and then a sufficient amount of acetic acid to cause this\r\nturbidity to disappear. The volume is then completed to one liter with\r\ndistilled water.\r\n\r\nThe uranium nitrate often contains some uranium phosphate and some\r\nferric nitrate. It is important that it be freed from these foreign\r\nsubstances. This is secured by dissolving it in distilled water and\r\nprecipitating it by sodium carbonate, which redissolves the uranium\r\noxid and precipitates the iron phosphate and oxid.\r\n\r\nThe filtered liquor is saturated with nitric acid, and the uranium oxid\r\nreprecipitated by ammonia. It is then washed with distilled water by\r\ndecantation and redissolved in nitric acid, as exactly as possible,\r\nevaporated, and crystallized.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are taken up with ether, which often leaves still a little\r\ninsoluble matter. The solution is filtered, and the ether evaporated.\r\nThe salt which remains is perfectly pure. It frequently happens when\r\nthe uranium nitrate has not been properly purified that the solution\r\nprepared as has been indicated above, deposits a light precipitate of\r\nphosphate which alters its strength and affords a cause of error. Only\r\nthose solutions should be employed which have been prepared some days\r\nin advance, and which have remained perfectly limpid.\r\n\r\nThe solution of uranium thus obtained contains uranium nitrate, a\r\nlittle ammonium nitrate, a very small quantity of uranium acetate, some\r\nammonium acetate, and a little free acetic acid. Its sensibility is the\r\nmore pronounced as the acetates present in it are less in quantity. It\r\nis important, therefore, never to prepare the solution with uranium\r\nacetate.\r\n\r\n=96. Typical Solution of Phosphoric Acid.=—In order to titrate a\r\nsolution of uranium, it is necessary to have a standard solution of\r\nphosphoric acid; that is to say, a solution containing a precise\r\nand known quantity of that acid in a given volume. This solution is\r\nprepared by means of acid ammonium phosphate, a salt which is easily\r\nobtained pure and dry. Sometimes as it may contain a small quantity\r\nof neutral phosphate which modifies the relative proportions of\r\nphosphoric acid and ammonia, and it is indispensable to have its\r\nstrength verified. The titer of the typical solution should be such\r\nthat it requires for the precipitation of the phosphoric acid which\r\nit contains, a volume of the solution of uranium almost exactly equal\r\nto its own, in order that the expansions or contractions which the\r\ntwo liquors undergo, by reason of changes in the temperature of the\r\nlaboratory, should be without influence upon the results.\r\n\r\nThe solution of uranium prepared as has been indicated above,\r\nprecipitates almost exactly five milligrams of phosphoric acid per\r\ncubic centimeter; the typical solution of phosphoric acid is prepared\r\nwith eight and one-tenth grams of acid ammonium phosphate pure and dry,\r\nwhich is dissolved in a sufficient quantity of distilled water to make\r\none liter.\r\n\r\nThe acid ammonium phosphate containing 61.74 per cent of anhydrous\r\nphosphoric acid, the quantity above gives exactly five grams of that\r\nacid in a liter, or five milligrams in a cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n=97. Verification of the Strength of the Standard Solution of\r\nPhosphoric Acid.=—The strength of the standard solution of phosphoric\r\nacid is verified by evaporating a known volume, fifty cubic centimeters\r\nfor example, with a solution of ferric hydroxid containing a known\r\nquantity of ferric oxid. The mass having been evaporated to dryness,\r\nand ignited in a platinum crucible, gives an increase in the weight of\r\nthe iron oxid exactly equal to the amount of anhydrous phosphoric acid\r\ncontained therein, both the nitric acid and ammonia being driven off by\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the solution of ferric hydroxid, dissolve twenty grams of\r\niron filings in hydrochloric acid. The solution is filtered to separate\r\nthe carbon, and it is converted into ferric nitrate by nitric acid,\r\nand the solution diluted with distilled water, and the ferric oxid\r\nprecipitated by a slight excess of ammonia. The precipitate, washed by\r\ndecantation with distilled water until the wash-water no longer gives a\r\nprecipitate with silver nitrate, is redissolved in nitric acid, and the\r\nsolution is concentrated or diluted, as the case may be, to bring the\r\nvolume to one liter.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the quantity of ferric oxid which it contains,\r\nfifty cubic centimeters are evaporated to dryness, ignited, and weighed.\r\n\r\nA second operation like the above is carried on by adding fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the standard solution of phosphoric acid, and the\r\nstrength of the solution thus obtained is marked upon the flask.\r\n\r\nIf the operation have been properly carried on, three or four\r\nduplicates will give exactly the same figures. If there are sensible\r\ndifferences, the whole operation should be done over from the first.\r\n\r\n=98. Titration of the Solution of Uranium.=—In a 150 cubic centimeter\r\nflask marked at seventy-five cubic centimeters, are poured ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the standard solution of phosphoric acid measured with\r\nan exact pipette; five cubic centimeters of the acid sodium acetate\r\nare added, and distilled water enough to make about thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters, and the whole carried to the boiling-point. The titration\r\nis then carried on by allowing the solution of uranium to fall into the\r\nflask from a graduated burette, thoroughly shaking after each addition\r\nof the uranium, and trying a drop of the liquor with an equal quantity\r\nof a ten per cent solution of potassium ferrocyanid upon a greased\r\nwhite plate. Since the quantity of the uranium solution present will\r\nbe very nearly ten cubic centimeters at first, nine cubic centimeters\r\ncan be run in without testing. Afterwards, the operation is continued\r\nby adding two or three drops at a time until the test upon the white\r\nplate with the potassium ferrocyanid shows the end of the reaction.\r\nWhen there is observed in the final test a slight change of tint, the\r\nflask is filled up to the mark with boiling distilled water and the\r\nprocess tried anew. If in the first part of the operation the point\r\nof saturation have not been passed, it is still usually necessary to\r\nadd a drop or two of the uranium solution in order to produce the\r\ncharacteristic reddish coloration, and this increase is rendered\r\nnecessary by the increase in the volume of the liquid. Proceeding\r\nin this manner two or three times allows the attainment of extreme\r\nprecision, inasmuch as the analyst knows just when to look for the\r\npoint of saturation.\r\n\r\n_Correction._—The result of the preceding operation is not absolutely\r\nexact. It is evident indeed that in addition to the quantity of uranium\r\nnecessary for the exact precipitation of the phosphoric acid, it has\r\nbeen necessary to add an excess sufficient to produce the reaction upon\r\nthe potassium ferrocyanid.\r\n\r\nThis excess is rendered constant by the precaution of operating always\r\nupon the same volume; namely, seventy-five cubic centimeters. It can be\r\ndetermined then once for all by making a blank determination under the\r\nsame conditions but without using the phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe result of this determination is that it renders possible the\r\ncorrection which it is necessary to make by subtracting the quantity\r\nused in the blank titration from the preceding result in order to\r\nobtain the exact strength of the uranium solution.\r\n\r\nThe operation is carried on as follows: In a flat-bottomed flask of\r\nabout 150 cubic centimeters capacity and marked at seventy-five cubic\r\ncentimeters, by means of a pipette, are placed five cubic centimeters\r\nof the solution of sodium acetate; some hot distilled water is added\r\nuntil the flask is filled to the mark, and it is then placed upon a\r\nsand-bath and heated to the boiling-point. It is taken from the fire,\r\nthe volume made up to seventy-five cubic centimeters with a little hot\r\ndistilled water, and one or two drops of the solution of uranium are\r\nallowed to flow into the flask from a graduated burette previously\r\nfilled exactly to zero. After each drop of the solution of uranium\r\nthe flask is shaken and the liquid tried upon a drop of potassium\r\nferrocyanid, as has been previously indicated. For a skilled eye, four\r\nto six drops are generally necessary to obtain the characteristic\r\ncoloration; that is from two-tenths to three-tenths of a cubic\r\ncentimeter. Beginners often use from five-tenths to six-tenths, and\r\nsometimes even more.\r\n\r\nThe sole important point is to arrest the operation as soon as the\r\nreddish tint is surely seen, for afterwards the intensity of the\r\ncoloration does not increase proportionally to the quantity of liquor\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIt is well to note that at the end of some time the coloration becomes\r\nmore intense than at the moment when the solutions are mixed, so that\r\ncare must be taken not to pass the saturation-point. This slowness of\r\nthe reaction is the more marked as there is more sodium or ammonium\r\nacetate in the standard solutions. This is the reason that it is\r\nimportant to introduce always the same quantity; namely, five cubic\r\ncentimeters. This is also the reason why the uranium acetate should\r\nnot be employed in preparing the standard solution of uranium which\r\nought to contain the least possible amount of acetate in order that\r\nthe necessary quantity which is carried into each test should be as\r\nsmall as possible and remain without appreciable influence. If it\r\nwere otherwise, the sensibility of the reaction would be diminished\r\nin proportion as a larger quantity of uranium solution was employed,\r\ngiving rise to errors which would be as much more important as the\r\nquantities of phosphoric acid to be determined were greater. The\r\ncorrection for the uranium solution having been determined it is\r\nwritten upon the label of the bottle containing it.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Errors._—In the work which has just been described, some\r\ncauses of error may occur to which the attention of analysts should be\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThe first is the error which may arise from the consumption of the\r\nsmall quantity of uranium phosphate which is taken with a stirring rod\r\nwhen the liquid is tested with potassium ferrocyanid. It is very easy\r\nto be assured that the end of the reaction has really been reached. For\r\nthis purpose it is only necessary to note the quantity of the solution\r\nalready employed and to add to it afterwards four drops; shake, and\r\nmake a new test with a drop of the potassium ferrocyanid placed near\r\nthe spot which the last one occupied. If a decidedly reddish tint\r\ndoes not appear at the moment of removing the glass rod, it is to be\r\nconcluded that the first appearance was an illusion, and the addition\r\nof uranium is to be continued. If, on the contrary, the coloration\r\nappear of a decided tint, the preceding number may be taken for exact.\r\nIt is then always beneficial to close the titration by this test of\r\nfour supplementary drops which will exaggerate the coloration and\r\nconfirm the figure found.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of error, and one moreover which is the most\r\nfrequently met with, consists in passing the end of the reaction by\r\nadding the uranium too rapidly. In place of giving then a coloration\r\nscarcely perceptible, the test with the drop of potassium ferrocyanid\r\ngives a very marked coloration. In this case the analysis can still\r\nbe saved. For this purpose the analyst has, at his disposal, a tenth\r\nnormal solution prepared with 100 cubic centimeters of the standard\r\nsolution of phosphoric acid diluted to one liter with distilled water.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of this tenth normal solution are added, and the\r\ntitration continued. At the end, the amount of additional phosphoric\r\nacid used is subtracted from the total.\r\n\r\nA third cause of error is found in the foam which is often found in\r\nthe liquid, due to the shaking. This foam may retain a portion of the\r\nlast drops of the solution of uranium which fall upon its surface and\r\nprevent its mixture with the rest of the liquid. If the glass stirring\r\nrod in being removed from the vessel pass through this froth charged\r\nwith uranium, the characteristic coloration is obtained before real\r\nsaturation is reached. Consequently it is necessary to avoid, as much\r\nas possible, the formation of the foam, and especially to take care\r\nnever to take the drop for test after agitation except in the middle of\r\nthe liquid where the foam does not exist.\r\n\r\nSuppose the titration has been made upon ten cubic centimeters of the\r\nnormal solution of phosphoric acid in the conditions which we have\r\njust indicated, and the figure for the uranium obtained is 10.2 cubic\r\ncentimeters; if now the correction, which may be supposed to amount\r\nto two-tenths cubic centimeter, be subtracted there will remain ten\r\ncubic centimeters of the uranium solution which would have precipitated\r\nexactly fifty milligrams of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of phosphoric acid which precipitates one cubic centimeter\r\nof the solution will be consequently expressed by the proportion\r\n⁵⁰/₁₀ = five milligrams, which is exactly the strength required. In\r\nthe example which has just been given, the inscription upon the flask\r\nholding the standard solution would be as follows: Solution of uranium,\r\none cubic centimeter equals five milligrams of phosphorus pentoxid;\r\ncorrection, two-tenths cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n=99. Titration of the Sample.=—The strength of the solution of uranium\r\nhaving been exactly determined, by means of this solution the strength\r\nof the sample in which the phosphoric acid has been previously prepared\r\nas ammonium magnesium phosphate is ascertained. In this case the\r\nquantity of phosphoric acid being unknown, it is necessary to proceed\r\nslowly and to duplicate the tests in order not to pass beyond the point\r\nof saturation. From this there necessarily results a certain error in\r\nconsequence of the removal of quite a number of drops of the solution\r\nof the sample before the saturation is complete. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to make a second determination in which there is at once\r\nadded almost the quantity of the solution of uranium determined by the\r\nfirst analysis. Afterwards the analysis is finished by additions of\r\nvery small quantities of uranium until saturation is reached. Suppose,\r\nfor instance, that the sample was that of a mineral phosphate, five\r\ngrams of which were dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters, and of which\r\nten cubic centimeters of the solution prepared as above required 15.3\r\ncubic centimeters of the standard solution of uranium. We then would\r\nhave the following data:\r\n\r\n    Mineral phosphate, five grams of the material dissolved in\r\n    twenty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n    Water, sufficient quantity to make 100 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n    Quantity taken, ten cubic centimeters = 0.50 gram of the\r\n    sample taken.\r\n\r\n    Solution of uranium required         15.3 cubic centimeters.\r\n    Correction                            0.2   “        “\r\n                                         ----\r\n    Actual quantity of uranium solution  15.1   “        “\r\n\r\n    Strength of the solution of uranium, one cubic centimeter\r\n                                           = fivemilligrams P₂O₅.\r\n\r\n    Then P₂O₅ in 0.50 gram of the material = 5 × 15.1 = 75.50\r\n    milligrams.\r\n\r\n                               (75.5 x 100)\r\n    Then the per cent of P₂O₅ = ----------- = 15.10.\r\n                                     50\r\n\r\nThe sample under examination ought always to be prepared in duplicate,\r\neither by making a single precipitation and re-solution of the ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate which is made up to a certain volume and an\r\naliquot portion of which is taken for the analysis, or by making two\r\nprecipitations under the conditions previously described. When the\r\ncontent of phosphoric acid in the material under examination is very\r\nnearly known, the double operation may be avoided, especially if it be\r\nrequired to have rapid and only approximate analyses, such as those\r\nwhich are made for general control and for the conduct of manufacturing\r\noperations. But when analyses are to be used to serve as the basis of\r\na law or for the control of a market, they should always be made in\r\nduplicate, and the results ought not to be accepted when the numbers\r\nobtained are widely different, since the agreement of the two numbers\r\nwill show that the work has been well executed.\r\n\r\nThis method of analysis, much longer to describe than to execute, gives\r\nresults perfectly exact and always concordant when it is well carried\r\nout, provided that the standard solutions, upon which it rests for its\r\naccuracy, are correctly prepared and frequently verified in the manner\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the solution of uranium ought to be verified every\r\nthree or four days. The strength of the standard solution of phosphoric\r\nacid should be verified each time that the temperature of the\r\nlaboratory undergoes any important change. A solution prepared, for\r\nexample, in winter when the temperature of the laboratory is from 15°\r\nto 18° would no longer be exact in summer when the temperature reaches\r\n28° or 30°.\r\n\r\n=100. Condition of Phosphoric Acid in Superphosphates.=—Superphosphates\r\nare the products of the decomposition of phosphates by sulfuric or\r\nhydrochloric acid. They contain phosphoric acid combined with water,\r\nwith lime, with magnesia, and with iron and alumina in various\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThese combinations may be classed in three categories: First, those\r\ncompounds soluble in water; second, those insoluble in water, but\r\nvery soluble in ammoniacal salts of the organic acids such as the\r\ncitrate and oxalate; and third, phosphates not soluble in any of the\r\nabove-named reagents.\r\n\r\nIn the products soluble in water are met free phosphoric acid,\r\nmonocalcium phosphate, acid magnesium phosphate, and the iron and\r\naluminum phosphates dissolved in the excess of phosphoric acid. In\r\nthe products insoluble in water but soluble in the ammonium citrate\r\nare found bicalcium phosphate and iron and aluminum phosphates, which\r\ntogether constitute the phosphates called reverted.\r\n\r\nThese compounds reduced to a very fine state of division in the process\r\nof manufacture are considered to contain phosphoric acid of the same\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\n=101. Determination of the Total Phosphoric Acid in Superphosphates\r\nand Fertilizers.=—The process is carried on exactly as for an ordinary\r\nphosphate, and with all the care indicated in connection with the\r\nsampling, the incineration, the solution by means of hydrochloric acid,\r\nand the separation of the phosphoric acid in the state of ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate, and finally in the titration by uranium.\r\n\r\n=102. Determination of Soluble and Reverted Phosphoric Acid.=—To make\r\nthis determination a method unique and applicable to all cases consists\r\nin extracting, at first, the soluble constituents in distilled water,\r\nand following this operation by digestion in the ammonium citrate. The\r\nproducts soluble in water can be determined either separately or at the\r\nsame time as the products soluble in the ammonium citrate according\r\nto the taste of the people interested, without its being necessary to\r\nmodify very greatly the method of operation.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the soluble phosphoric acid comprises first, the\r\nsolution of the soluble constituents in distilled water; second, the\r\nsolution of the reverted phosphates in ammonium citrate; third, the\r\nprecipitation of the phosphoric acid dissolved in the two preceding\r\noperations, and its determination.\r\n\r\n=103. Preparation of the Sample for Analysis.=—The sample sent to the\r\nchemical expert is prepared as has been indicated; that is to say,\r\nit is poured on a sieve of which the meshes have a diameter of one\r\nmillimeter, and sifted upon a sheet of white paper. The parts which\r\ndo not pass the sieve are broken up either by the hand or in a mortar\r\nand added, through the sieve, to the first portions. The product is\r\nwell mixed and, in this state, the mass presents all the homogeneity\r\ndesirable for analysis.\r\n\r\nSome fertilizers are received in a pasty state which does not permit\r\nof their being sifted. It is necessary in such a case to mix them\r\nwith their own weight either of precipitated calcium sulfate dried at\r\n160° or with fine sand washed with hydrochloric acid and dried, which\r\ndivides the particles perfectly and permits of their being passed\r\nthrough the meshes of the sieve.\r\n\r\n=104. Extraction of the Products Soluble in Distilled Water.=—The\r\nsubstance having been prepared as has just been indicated, one and a\r\nhalf grams are placed in a glass mortar. Twenty cubic centimeters of\r\ndistilled water are added, and the substance gently suspended therein.\r\nAfter standing for one minute, the supernatant part is decanted into a\r\nsmall funnel provided with a filter-paper and placed in a flask marked\r\nat 150 cubic centimeters. This operation is repeated five times and\r\nis terminated by an intimate breaking up of the matter with distilled\r\nwater. When the volume of 100 cubic centimeters of the filtrate has\r\nbeen obtained, the residue in the mortar is placed on the filter, and\r\nthe washing is continued until the total volume reaches 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters. The filtrate is shaken in order to render the liquor\r\nhomogeneous, and is transferred to a precipitating glass of about 300\r\ncubic centimeters capacity.\r\n\r\n=105. Solution of the Reverted Phosphates by Ammonium Citrate.=—The\r\nfilter from the above process is detached from the funnel and is\r\nintroduced into a flask marked at 150 cubic centimeters together with\r\nsixty cubic centimeters of alkaline ammonium citrate prepared in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n    Pure citric acid, 400 grams.\r\n    Ammonia of 22°,   500 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia is poured upon the citric acid in the form of crystals in\r\na large dish. The mass becomes heated, and the solution takes place\r\nrapidly. When it is complete and the solution is cold it is poured\r\ninto a flask of one liter capacity, and the flask is filled up to the\r\nmark with strong ammonia. It is preserved for use in a well-stoppered\r\nbottle. The solution must be strongly alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe flask in which the filter-paper is introduced, together with\r\nthe ammonium citrate, is stoppered and shaken violently in order to\r\ndisintegrate the filter-paper and put the reverted phosphates in\r\nsuspension. There are added then about sixty cubic centimeters of\r\ndistilled water, and the flask is shaken and left for twelve hours\r\nat least, or at most for twenty-four hours. The volume is made up to\r\n150 cubic centimeters with distilled water, and, after mixture, the\r\nsolution is filtered.\r\n\r\nThere are thus obtained two solutions which can be precipitated\r\ntogether or separately according to circumstances. The most usual\r\nprocess is to combine the two equal volumes of twenty-five, fifty, or\r\none hundred cubic centimeters, representing one-quarter, one-half,\r\nor one gram of the material according to its presumed richness, in\r\na precipitating flask to which are added from ten to twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution of magnesia made up as follows:\r\n\r\n    Magnesium carbonate,   50 grams.\r\n    Ammonium chlorid,     100   “\r\n    Water,                500 cubic centimeters.\r\n    Hydrochloric acid,    120   “        “\r\n\r\nAfter complete solution of the solid matters in the above, add 100\r\ncubic centimeters of ammonia of 22° strength, and distilled water\r\nenough to make one liter.\r\n\r\nThe solutions are thoroughly mixed in a precipitating glass, an excess\r\nof ammonia added, and allowed to stand for twelve hours under a bell\r\njar. The phosphoric acid contained in the liquor is separated as\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate. It is collected upon a small filter,\r\nwashed with a little ammoniacal water, redissolved, and titrated with\r\nthe uranium solution in the manner already indicated.\r\n\r\n_Example_: The following is an example of this kind of a determination:\r\n\r\n(1) One and one-half grams of the superphosphate and distilled water\r\nenough to make 150 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n(2) Filter-paper with reverted phosphates, sixty cubic centimeters of\r\nammonium citrate, and a sufficient quantity of distilled water to make\r\n150 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n    Aqueous solution (1) 25 cc }\r\n                               } = 0.25 grams of the sample.\r\n    Citrate solution (2) 25 cc }\r\n\r\nAdd magnesium solution twenty cubic centimeters and ammonia in excess,\r\nand allow from twelve to twenty-four hours of digestion, then filter\r\nand wash, dissolve and titrate.\r\n\r\nRequired of solution of uranium 8.55 cubic centimeters (1 cubic\r\ncentimeter = 5 milligrams P₂O₅).\r\n\r\nCorrection 0.20.\r\n\r\nRemainder 8.35 × 0.005 = 0.04175 gram P₂O₅ for 0.25 gram of the sample.\r\nThen 0.04175 ÷ 0.25 = 16.7 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the above data there would be 16.7 per cent of phosphoric acid\r\nsoluble in water and in ammonium citrate.\r\n\r\nIf it be desirable to have separately the phosphoric acid soluble in\r\nwater, a separate precipitation is made of the aqueous solution alone\r\nby means of the magnesium citrate solution. The precipitate washed with\r\nammoniacal water is redissolved and titrated in the manner indicated.\r\n\r\nIn subtracting from the figures obtained with the two solutions\r\ntogether the number obtained for the phosphoric acid soluble in water,\r\nthe number representing the phosphoric acid soluble in ammonium citrate\r\nalone, is obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the determinations with uranium require always\r\ntwo successive titrations. It would therefore be an advantage in all\r\noperations to precipitate a weight of ammonium magnesium phosphate\r\nsufficient for allowing this precipitate to be dissolved and made\r\nup to 100 cubic centimeters on which amount it would be possible to\r\nexecute two, three, or four determinations, and thus to obtain a figure\r\nabsolutely incontestable.\r\n\r\n=106. Conclusions.=—It has been seen from the above data that the\r\nFrench chemists have worked out the uranium volumetric method with\r\ngreat patience and attention to detail. Where many determinations are\r\nto be made it is undoubtedly possible for an analyst to reach a high\r\ndegree of accuracy as well as to attain a desirable rapidity, by using\r\nthis method. For a few determinations, however, the labor of preparing\r\nand setting the standard solutions required would be far greater\r\nthan the actual determinations either by the molybdate or citrate\r\ngravimetric methods. For control work in factories and for routine\r\nwork connected with fertilizer inspection, the method has sufficient\r\nmerit to justify a comparison with the processes already in use by the\r\nofficial chemists of this country.\r\n\r\nThe use of an alkaline ammoniacal citrate solution, however, for the\r\ndetermination of reverted acid renders any comparison of the French\r\nmethod with our own impossible. On the other hand the French method for\r\nwater-soluble acid is based on the same principle as our own; _viz._,\r\nwashing at first with successive small portions of water, and thus\r\navoiding the decomposition of the soluble phosphates, which is, likely\r\nto occur when too great a volume of water is added at once.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the temperature and time as affecting the solubility\r\nof reverted acid, the French method is also distinctly inferior to our\r\nown. The digestion is allowed to continue from twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours, at the pleasure of the analyst, and meanwhile it is subjected to\r\nroom temperature. It is not difficult to see that this treatment in the\r\nsame sample would easily yield disagreeing results between twelve hours\r\nat a winter temperature and twenty-four hours at summer heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID BY TITRATION OF THE YELLOW\r\nPRECIPITATE.\r\n\r\n=107. Pemberton’s Volumetric Method.=—In order to shorten the work of\r\ndetermining the phosphoric acid, numerous attempts have been made to\r\nexecute the final determination directly on the yellow precipitate\r\nobtained by treating a solution of a phosphate with ammonium molybdate\r\nin nitric acid. The composition of this precipitate appears to be\r\nsomewhat variable, and this fact has cast doubt on the methods of\r\ndetermination based on its weight. Its most probable composition is\r\nexpressed by the following formula, (NH₄)₃PO₄(MoO₃)₁₂. For convenience\r\nin writing reactions this formula should usually be doubled. Pemberton\r\nhas described a volumetric determination of phosphoric acid in the\r\nyellow precipitate which has the merit of being rapid.[83]\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the method has not given very satisfactory results\r\nwhen compared with the molybdate gravimetric process. It has however\r\nattracted so much attention from analysts as to merit description, and\r\nthe details of the process are therefore given.\r\n\r\n=108. The Process.=—One gram of phosphate rock, or from two to\r\nthree grams of phosphatic fertilizer, are dissolved in nitric acid,\r\nand, without evaporation, diluted to 250 cubic centimeters. Without\r\nfiltering, twenty-five cubic centimeters are placed in a four-ounce\r\nbeaker and ammonia added until a slight precipitate begins to form.\r\nFive cubic centimeters of nitric acid of one and four-tenths specific\r\ngravity are then added, and afterwards ten cubic centimeters of\r\nsaturated solution of ammonium nitrate and enough water to make the\r\nvolume about sixty-five cubic centimeters. The contents of the beaker\r\nare boiled, and while still hot, five cubic centimeters of the aqueous\r\nsolution of ammonium molybdate added. Additional quantities of the\r\nmolybdate are added, if necessary, until the whole of the phosphorus\r\npentoxid is thrown-out.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing to settle for a moment the contents of the beaker are\r\npoured upon a filter seven centimeters in diameter. The precipitate is\r\nthoroughly washed with water, both by decantation and on the filter.\r\nThe filter with its precipitate is transferred to a beaker and titrated\r\nwith standard alkali, in the presence of phenolphthalein. Each cubic\r\ncentimeter of alkali employed should correspond to one milligram of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid, (P₂O₅).\r\n\r\nThe reagents employed have the composition indicated below:\r\n\r\n_Ammonium Molybdate._—Ninety grams of the crystals of ammonium\r\nmolybdate are placed in a large beaker and dissolved in a little less\r\nthan one liter of water. The beaker is allowed to stand over night\r\nand the clear liquor decanted. Any undissolved acid is brought into\r\nsolution in a little ammonia water and added to the clear liquor. If a\r\ntrace of phosphoric acid be present a little magnesium sulfate is added\r\nand enough ammonia to produce a slight alkaline reaction. The volume\r\nof the solution is then made up to one liter. Each cubic centimeter\r\nof this solution is capable of precipitating three milligrams of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid.\r\n\r\n_Standard Potassium Hydroxid._—This solution is made of such strength\r\nthat one cubic centimeter is equivalent to one milligram of phosphorus\r\npentoxid. Treated with acid of normal strength, 100 cubic centimeters\r\nare required to neutralize 32.37 cubic centimeters thereof.\r\n\r\n_Standard Acid._—This should have the same strength, volume for volume,\r\nas the standard alkali solution. It is made by diluting 323.7 cubic\r\ncentimeters of normal acid to one liter.\r\n\r\n_Indicator._—The indicator to be used is an alcoholic solution of\r\nphenolphthalein, one gram in 100 cubic centimeters of sixty per cent\r\nalcohol, and half a cubic centimeter of this should be used for each\r\ntitration.\r\n\r\nThomson has shown[84] that of the three hydrogen atoms in phosphoric\r\nacid two must be saturated with alkali before the reaction with\r\nphenolphthalein is neutral. Therefore, when the yellow precipitate\r\nis broken up by an alkali, according to the reaction to follow, only\r\nfour of the six molecules of ammonium are required to form a neutral\r\nammonium phosphate as determined by the indicator employed. The\r\nremaining two molecules of ammonium unite with the molybdenum forming\r\nalso a salt neutral to the indicator.\r\n\r\nPhenolphthalein is preferred because, as has been shown by Long, its\r\nresults are reliable in the presence of ammonium salts unless they\r\nbe present in large quantity, and if the solution be cold and the\r\nindicator be used in sufficient quantity.[85] To prepare the indicator\r\nfor this work, one gram of phenolphthalein is dissolved in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of sixty percent alcohol. At least one-half of a cubic\r\ncentimeter of the solution is used for each titration.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for the method are its speed and accuracy. Much\r\ntime is saved by avoiding the necessity for the removal of the silica\r\nby evaporation. The results of analyses with and without the removal of\r\nthe silica are practically identical. When the silica is not removed it\r\nis noticed that the filtrate from the yellow precipitate has a yellow\r\ntint.\r\n\r\nThe reaction is represented by the following formula:\r\n\r\n    (NH₄)₆(PO₄)₂(MoO₃)₂₄ + 46KOH = (NH₄)₄(HPO₄)₂ + (NH₄)₂MoO₄\r\n                                    + 23K₂MoO₄ + 22H₂O.\r\n\r\nFrom this reaction it is seen that the total available acidity of one\r\nmolecule of the yellow precipitate titrated against phenolphthalein is\r\nequivalent to twenty-three molecules of potassium hydroxid.\r\n\r\n_Calculation of Results._—The standard alkali is of such strength\r\nthat one cubic centimeter is equal to one per cent of phosphoric acid\r\nwhen one gram of material is employed and one-tenth of it taken for\r\neach determination. In a given case one gram of a sample was taken\r\nand one-tenth of the solution used. Fifty cubic centimeters of alkali\r\nwere added to the yellow precipitate. It required thirty-two cubic\r\ncentimeters of standard alkali to neutralize the excess.\r\n\r\nThe alkali consumed by the yellow precipitate was 50 - 32 = 18. The\r\nsample therefore contained eighteen per cent of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n_Comparison with Official Method._—A comparison of the Pemberton\r\nvolumetric with the official method of the Association of Agricultural\r\nChemists has been made by Day and Bryant.[86] The comparisons were made\r\non samples containing from 1.45 to 37.28 per cent of phosphoric acid\r\nand resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n                             Per cent      Per cent\r\n                               P₂O₅,          P₂O₅,\r\n            Substance.       Official.     Pemberton.\r\n\r\n    No. 1. Florida rock         1.45          1.32\r\n     “  2.    “     “           4.40          4.53\r\n     “  3. Sodium phosphate    19.78         19.99\r\n     “  4.    “     “          19.72         19.73\r\n     “  5. Florida rock        37.28         37.22\r\n\r\nThis near agreement shows the reliability of the method. The comparison\r\nof the Pemberton volumetric method with the official gravimetric\r\nmethod was investigated by the reporter of the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists in 1894.[87] The individual variations were found\r\nto be greater than in the regular method but the average results were\r\nnearly identical therewith. The method works far better with small\r\npercentages of phosphoric acid than with large. Where the average\r\nof the results by the official methods gave 12.25 per cent, the\r\nvolumetric process gave 11.90 per cent, whereas in the determination\r\nof a smaller percentage the results were 2.72 and 2.73 per cent,\r\nrespectively. Kilgore proposes a variation of the method which differs\r\nfrom the original in two principal points.[88] First the temperature\r\nof precipitation in the Pemberton process is 100°; but in the modified\r\nform from 55° to 60°. At the higher temperature there is danger of\r\ndepositing molybdic acid.\r\n\r\nThe second difference is in the composition of the molybdate solution\r\nemployed. The official molybdate solution contains about sixty grams\r\nof molybdenum trioxid in a liter while the Pemberton solution contains\r\nsixty-six grams. There is therefore not much difference in strength.\r\nThe absence of nitric acid, however, from the Pemberton solution favors\r\nthe deposition of the molybdic acid when heat is applied. Kilgore,\r\ntherefore, conducts the analysis as follows: The solution of the sample\r\nis made according to the official nitric and hydrochloric acid method\r\nfor total phosphoric acid. For the determination, twenty or forty cubic\r\ncentimeters are taken, corresponding to two-tenths or four-tenths\r\ngram of the sample. Ammonia is added until a slight precipitate is\r\nproduced and the volume is then made up, with water, to seventy-five\r\ncubic centimeters. Add some ammonium nitrate solution, from ten to\r\nfifteen cubic centimeters, but this addition is not necessary unless\r\nmuch of the nitric acid has been driven off during solution. Heat in\r\nwater-bath to 60° and precipitate with some freshly filtered official\r\nmolybdate solution. Allow to stand for five minutes, filter as quickly\r\nas possible, wash four times by decantation using from fifty to\r\nseventy-five cubic centimeters of water each time, and then wash on a\r\nfilter until all acid is removed. The solution and titration of the\r\nyellow precipitate are accomplished as in the Pemberton method. The\r\nagreement of the results obtained by this modified method was much\r\ncloser with the official gravimetric method than those obtained by the\r\nPemberton process.\r\n\r\n=109. Estimation of Phosphoric Acid as a Lead Compound.=—In the\r\nvolumetric lead method, as described by Wavelet, the phosphoric acid\r\nis precipitated by the magnesium citrate solution as in the uranium\r\nmethod of Joulie, as practiced by the French chemists, and the washing\r\nof the precipitate and its solution in nitric acid are also conducted\r\nas in that method.[89] After solution in nitric acid ammonia is added\r\nto neutrality and the solution is then made acid with acetic. The\r\nphosphoric acid is precipitated in the acid solution by a standard\r\nsolution of lead nitrate, the precipitate having the formula P₂O₅3PbO.\r\n\r\nThe end reaction is determined by placing a drop of the titrated\r\nmixture on a white greased dish in contact with a drop of a five per\r\ncent solution of potassium iodid. When all the phosphoric acid is\r\nprecipitated the least excess of the lead salt is revealed by the\r\ncharacteristic yellow precipitate of lead iodid.\r\n\r\nThe author of the process claims that the lead phosphate is insoluble\r\nin the excess of acetic acid and that the phosphate itself does not\r\ngive any yellow coloration with potassium iodid. The process is quite\r\nas exact as the uranium method and the end reaction is far sharper and\r\nthe standard reagents are easily made and preserved.[90] The method\r\ndescribed merits, at least, a comparative trial with the uranium\r\nprocess, but cannot be recommended as exact until further approved by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe reagents employed have the following composition:\r\n\r\n    (1) Disodium phosphate solution containing 10.085 grams per liter\r\n    (2) Sodium acetate        “         “      50.000   “    “    “\r\n    (3) Lead nitrate          “         “      40.000   “    “    “\r\n    (4) Potassium iodid       “         “      50.000   “    “    “\r\n\r\nThe titrations should be conducted in the cold.\r\n\r\n=110. Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=—Glaser has modified the\r\nvolumetric method of Kalmann and Meissels for the volumetric estimation\r\nof water-soluble phosphoric acid so as to avoid the double titration\r\nrequired by the original method.[91] If methyl orange be used as an\r\nindicator in the original method, the determination does not at once\r\nlead to the tricalcium salt, but the liquid still contains, after\r\nneutralization, some monocalcium phosphate, which is determined by a\r\nfurther titration with phenolphthalein. In the modified method the\r\ntotal phosphoric acid is estimated in one operation as a tricalcium\r\nsalt. This is secured, by adding, at the proper time, an excess of\r\ncalcium chlorid. Two grams of the superphosphate are shaken with water\r\nseveral times, and, after settling, filtered, and the insoluble residue\r\nfinally washed on the filter until the total volume of the filtrate\r\nis a quarter of a liter. Of this, fifty cubic centimeters are taken\r\nand titrated with tenth normal soda-lye, with addition of two drops of\r\nmethyl orange, until the acid reaction has entirely disappeared. There\r\nis then added some neutral calcium chlorid solution in excess. If iron\r\nand alumina be present, a precipitate is produced of which no account\r\nneed be made. The acid reaction is thus restored. Five drops of the\r\nphenolphthalein solution are added and the titration continued until\r\nthe alkaline reaction is noted throughout the whole mass. Each cubic\r\ncentimeter of the soda-lye corresponds, in the first titration, to 7.1,\r\nand in the second to 3.55 milligrams of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n=111. Estimation of Phosphoric Acid in the Presence of a Large Excess\r\nof Iron.=—The method given below, due to Emmerton, depends upon the\r\nprecipitation of a phosphomolybdate, of constant composition, in the\r\npresence of a large excess of iron, as in the analysis of iron and\r\nsteel and iron ores.[92] The molybdenum trioxid obtained is reduced by\r\nzinc to Mo₁₂O₁₉. The action of permanganate on this compound is shown\r\nin the following equation:\r\n\r\n    5Mo₁₂O₁₉ + 17(K₂OMn₂O₇) = 60MoO₃ + 17K₂O + 34MnO.\r\n\r\nSeventeen molecules of permanganate are equal to sixty molecules of\r\nmolybdenum trioxid. The iron or steel is dissolved in nitric acid,\r\nevaporated to dryness, heated, and redissolved in hydrochloric acid,\r\nthen treated again with nitric acid and evaporated until a clear and\r\nconcentrated solution is obtained free from hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe solution obtained is diluted to forty cubic centimeters with water\r\nand washed into a 400 cubic centimeter flask, making the total volume\r\nabout seventy-five cubic centimeters. Add strong ammonia, shaking\r\nafter each addition, until the mass sets to a thick jelly from the\r\nferric hydroxid. Add a few more cubic centimeters of ammonia and shake\r\nthoroughly, being sure the ammonia is present in excess. Add next\r\nnitric acid gradually, with shaking, until the precipitate has all\r\ndissolved; add enough more nitric acid to make the solution a clear\r\namber color. The volume should now be about 250 cubic centimeters.\r\nBring the solution to 85° and add, at once, forty cubic centimeters\r\nof molybdate solution of the following strength: Dissolve 100 grams\r\nof molybdic acid in 300 cubic centimeters of strong ammonia and 100\r\ncubic centimeters of water, and pour the solution into 1,250 cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid (1.20); close the flask with a rubber\r\nstopper, wrap it in a thick cloth, and shake violently for five\r\nminutes. Collect the precipitate on a filter, using pump, and wash with\r\ndilute nitric acid (1 HNO₃: 50 H₂O). If a thin film of the precipitate\r\nshould adhere to the flask it can be removed by the ammonia in the next\r\noperation. Wash the molybdate precipitate into a 500 cubic centimeter\r\nflask with dilute ammonia (1 H₃N: 4 H₂O), using about thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters. Add hot dilute sulfuric acid (1 H₂SO₄: 4 H₂O) and cover\r\nthe flask with a small funnel. Add ten grams of granulated zinc and\r\nheat until rapid action begins, and then heat gently for five minutes.\r\nThe reduction is then complete. During the reduction the colors, pink,\r\nplum, pale green, and dark green, are seen in the molybdate solution,\r\nthe latter color marking the end of the reaction.\r\n\r\nTo remove the zinc, pour through a large folded filter, wash with\r\ncold water, and fill up the filter once with cold water. But little\r\noxidation takes place in this way. A port-wine color is seen on the\r\nfilter, but this does not indicate a sufficient oxidation to make an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nIn titrating, the wine color becomes fainter and finally the solution\r\nis perfectly colorless and shows a single drop in excess of the\r\npermanganate. The permanganate solution, for convenience, is made so\r\nthat one cubic centimeter is equal to 0.0001 gram of phosphorus. With\r\niron its value is one cubic centimeter equals 0.006141 gram of iron;\r\nand one cubic centimeter equals 0.005574 gram of molybdenum trioxid.\r\n\r\n=112. Variation of Dudley and Noyes.=—The method of Emmerton to\r\ndetermine small quantities of phosphoric acid, or of phosphorus in\r\npresence of a large excess of iron, has been modified by Dudley and\r\nPease,[93] and by Noyes and Royse.[94] As modified, the method is\r\nnot intended for fertilizer analysis, but the principle on which it\r\nrests may some time, with proper modifications, find application in\r\nfertilizer work. The reduction is accomplished in a Jones’ tube,[95]\r\nmuch simplified, so as to render it suitable for common use. The\r\nmolybdic acid is reduced to a form, or series of forms, corresponding\r\nto molybdenum sesquioxid, as in the Emmerton method, and subsequently\r\nas in that method, titrated by a set solution of potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\nThe iron or steel filings, containing phosphorus, are brought into\r\nsolution by means of nitric acid. For this purpose two grams of them\r\nare placed in a half liter flask together with fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof nitric acid of 1.18 specific gravity. The mixture is boiled for one\r\nminute, and ten cubic centimeters of permanganate solution of one and\r\na quarter per cent added. Boil again until the pink color disappears.\r\nFerrous sulfate solution is next to be carefully added, shaking\r\nmeanwhile, until the solution clears. Cool to 50° and add eight cubic\r\ncentimeters of ammonia of 0.90 specific gravity, stopper the flask,\r\nand shake until any precipitate which may form is redissolved. Cool or\r\nwarm, as the case may be, until the solution is as many degrees above\r\nor below 60° as the molybdic solution is above or below 27°. Add sixty\r\ncubic centimeters of molybdic solution, stopper, and shake on a machine\r\nor by hand for five minutes. After remaining at rest for five minutes\r\npour into a nine centimeter filter of fine texture and wash with the\r\nacid ammonium sulfate solution in quantities of from five to ten cubic\r\ncentimeters each time. The filtrate and washings must be perfectly\r\nbright. Continue the washings until the filtrate gives no color with\r\nhydrogen sulfid.\r\n\r\nDissolve the yellow precipitate with twelve cubic centimeters of 0.96\r\nammonia diluted with an equal volume of water, and wash the filter\r\nwith 100 cubic centimeters of water. Finally add to the filtrate and\r\nwash-water eighty cubic centimeters of water and ten of strong sulfuric\r\nacid. Pass the mixture through the Jones’ reducing tube and follow it\r\nwith 200 cubic centimeters of water, taking care that no air enter the\r\ntube during the operations. The solution collected in the flask should\r\nbe at once titrated with potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\n_Solutions used_: (1) _Nitric acid._—One part of nitric acid of 1.42\r\nspecific gravity and two parts of water by volume. The specific gravity\r\nof the mixture is about 1.18.\r\n\r\n(2) _Permanganate solution for oxidizing._—Dissolve 12.5 grams of\r\npotassium permanganate in one liter of water.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ferrous sulfate._—Fresh crystals not effervesced and free from\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\n(4) _Ammonia._—The strong ammonia used should have a specific gravity\r\nof about 0.90 and the dilute of 0.96 at 15.5°.\r\n\r\n(5) _Molybdic Solution._—Dissolve 100 grams of molybdic anhydrid in\r\n400 cubic centimeters of ammonia of 0.96 specific gravity and pour the\r\nsolution slowly, with constant stirring, into one liter of nitric acid\r\nof about 1.20 specific gravity. Heat the mixture to 45° and add one\r\ncubic centimeter of a ten per cent solution of sodium phosphate, stir\r\nvigorously, and allow to stand in a warm place for eighteen hours.\r\nFilter before using.\r\n\r\n(6) _Add Ammonium Sulfate._—To half a liter of water add 27.5 cubic\r\ncentimeters of 0.96 ammonia and twenty-four cubic centimeters of strong\r\nsulfuric acid, and make the volume one liter with water.\r\n\r\n(7) _Potassium Permanganate for Titration._—Dissolve four grams of\r\npotassium permanganate in two liters of water, heat nearly to boiling\r\nfor an hour, allow to stand for eighteen hours, and filter on asbestos\r\nfelt. The solution must not come in contact with rubber or other\r\norganic matter. The solution may be standardized with thoroughly\r\nair-dried ammonium oxalate in solution with a little dilute sulfuric\r\nacid and with ammonium ferrous sulfate partly crystallized in small\r\ncrystals from a slightly acid solution. The crystals should be well\r\nwashed and quickly air-dried in a thin layer. The factors 1/1 1/4 2/2\r\nand 1/7 should be used respectively to calculate the iron equivalent.\r\nThe phosphorus equivalent is obtained by multiplying the iron\r\nequivalent by 31 ÷ (36 × 56) = 0.01538.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.\r\n\r\nJONES’ REDUCTION TUBE.]\r\n\r\n_Reduction Apparatus._—The reduction of the molybdic acid to molybdenum\r\ntrioxid is accomplished in a tube first proposed by Jones. The\r\napparatus is shown in Figure 7. A piece of moderately heavy glass\r\ntubing thirty-five centimeters long with an internal diameter of\r\ntwo centimeters is drawn out at the lower end so as to pass into\r\nthe stopper of a flask. A circular piece of perforated platinum or\r\nporcelain rests on the constricted portion of the tube and this is\r\ncovered with an asbestos felt. The tube is then nearly filled with\r\npowdered zinc which is washed, before using, with dilute sulfuric acid\r\n(1: 20). A, B, C represent different methods of filtering the molybdic\r\nsolution. In A a platinum cone is placed in the constricted portion of\r\nthe tube and the asbestos felt placed thereon and the tube then filled\r\nwith the granulated zinc. In B there is first inserted a perforated\r\ndisk then some very fine sand and this is covered with another disk. In\r\nC there is a perforated disk which is covered with asbestos felt. The\r\nfiltering arrangement should be such as to prevent any zinc particles\r\nfrom reaching the flask and yet permitting the filtration to go on\r\nwithout much difficulty. A blank determination is first made by adding\r\nto 180 cubic centimeters of water, twelve of 0.96 ammonia and ten of\r\nstrong sulfuric acid. This is poured through the reducing tube and\r\nfollowed with 200 cubic centimeters of water taking care that no air\r\nenter the apparatus. Hydrogen peroxid is formed if air enter. Even\r\nafter standing for a few moments the tube should be washed with dilute\r\nsulfuric acid before again using it. The filtrate should be titrated\r\nwith the permanganate solution and the amount required deducted from\r\nthe following amounts obtained with the molybdic salt.\r\n\r\n_Calculations._—The calculations of the amount of phosphorus in a given\r\nsample of iron or steel are made according to the following data: In\r\na given case let it be supposed that the permanganate solution is set\r\nwith a solution of piano wire and it is found that one cubic centimeter\r\nof permanganate liquor is equal to 0.003466 gram of metallic iron. It\r\nis found that 90.76 parts of molybdic acid will produce the same effect\r\non permanganate as 100 parts of iron. Hence one cubic centimeter of\r\npermanganate solution is equivalent to 0.003466 × 0.9076 = 0.003145\r\ngram of molybdic acid. In the yellow precipitate formed, in the\r\nconditions named for the analysis it is found that the phosphorus is\r\none and nine-tenths per cent of the molybdic acid present. Therefore\r\none cubic centimeter of permanganate liquor is equal to 0.003145 ×\r\n0.019 = 0.0000597 gram of phosphorus. If then, for example, in a sample\r\nof iron or steel eight and six-tenths cubic centimeters of permanganate\r\nsolution, after correction, be found necessary to oxidize the molybdic\r\nsolution after passing through the Jones’ reducing tube, the amount of\r\nphosphorus found is 0.0000597 × 8.6 = 0.051 per cent.\r\n\r\n=113. The Silver Method.=—The separation of the phosphoric acid by\r\nsilver according to the method of Perrot has been investigated by\r\nSpencer, who found the process unreliable.[96] By a modification of the\r\nprocess, however, Spencer obtained fairly satisfactory results. The\r\nprinciple of this method depends on the separation of the phosphoric\r\nacid by silver carbonate and the subsequent titration thereof with\r\nstandard uranium solution after the removal of the excess of silver.\r\nThe operation is conducted as follows: The fertilizer is first ignited\r\nuntil all organic matter and residual carbon are destroyed. Solution\r\nis then accomplished by means of nitric acid and the volume completed\r\nto a definite quantity. An aliquot part is taken, after filtration,\r\nvarying with the supposed strength of the solution so as to contain\r\nabout 100 milligrams of phosphorus pentoxid. In the slightly nitric\r\nacid solution add freshly prepared silver carbonate in excess, that\r\nis, sufficient to saturate any free acid present and also to combine\r\nwith all the phosphoric acid. Wash thoroughly with hot water and then\r\ndissolve the mixed phosphate and silver carbonate in nitric acid and\r\nremove the silver from the solution with sodium chlorid. The phosphoric\r\nacid is determined in the filtrate by means of a standard solution of\r\nuranium nitrate in the manner already described. Spencer found that the\r\nseparation of the phosphoric acid by the silver method was more exact\r\nthan by the Joulie magnesium citrate process. With practice on the part\r\nof the analyst in determining the end reaction the process is both\r\nrapid and accurate. The method is also inexpensive, as both the silver\r\nand uranium are easily recovered from the waste.\r\n\r\n=114. Volumetric Silver Method.=—Holleman has proposed a modification\r\nof the silver method for the volumetric determination of phosphoric\r\nacid, which is conducted in the following manner:[97]\r\n\r\nIn a flask of 200 cubic centimeters capacity, are placed fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the liquid to be analyzed, which should not contain\r\nmore than two-tenths gram of phosphoric acid. The solution is treated\r\nwith ten cubic centimeters of a normal solution of sodium acetate and\r\nafterwards with a slight excess of decinormal silver solution, four\r\nand five-tenths cubic centimeters for each 0.01 gram of phosphoric\r\nacid. The solution is then neutralized with tenth normal sodium\r\nhydroxid, the amount required having been previously determined by\r\ntitrating ten cubic centimeters of the liquid to be analyzed, using\r\nphenolphthalein as an indicator. Five times the quantity required for\r\nthe neutralization of the ten cubic centimeters is added, less one-half\r\ncubic centimeter. By this treatment the phosphoric acid in the presence\r\nof sodium acetate is completely precipitated as silver phosphate. The\r\nexcess of silver is determined by diluting the mixture to 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters, filtering, and titrating 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate with ammonium thiocyanate. The presence of sulfuric and nitric\r\nacids does not interfere with the reaction, but of course hydrochloric\r\nacid must be absent. Alkalies and alkaline earth metals may be present,\r\nbut not the heavy metals.\r\n\r\nWhen iron and aluminum are present 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nsolution are precipitated with thirty cubic centimeters of normal\r\nsodium acetate, the phosphoric acid is determined in fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate, and the precipitate of iron and aluminum\r\nphosphates is ignited and weighed, and its weight multiplied by 2.225\r\nis added to the phosphoric anhydrid found volumetrically. If ammonia\r\nbe present it must be removed by boiling, as otherwise it affects the\r\ntitration with phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nFor agricultural purposes this method can have but little value\r\ninasmuch as the phosphates to be examined almost always have a certain\r\nproportion of iron and aluminum. Inasmuch as the amount of these bases\r\nhas to be determined gravimetrically, there would be no gain in time\r\nand no simplification of the processes by the use of the volumetric\r\nmethod as proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID.\r\n\r\n=115. Desirability Of Methods.=—In the preceding paragraphs, has been\r\ngiven a statement of the principal methods now in use by chemists\r\nand others connected with fertilizer control for the scientific and\r\nagronomic determinations of phosphoric acid, and its agricultural value.\r\n\r\nA résumé of the important methods, in a form suited to use in a factory\r\nfor preparing phosphatic fertilizers for the market, seems desirable.\r\nIn these factories the chemists have been accustomed to use their\r\nown, or private methods, and there has not been a general disposition\r\namong them to publish their methods and experience for the common\r\nbenefit. For factory processes, a method should be not only reasonably\r\naccurate, but also simple and rapid. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nthe general principles already indicated must underlie any method\r\nwhich would prove useful to factory work. Albert has made a résumé of\r\nsuch methods applicable for factory control, and these are given here\r\nfor convenience, although they are, in many respects, but condensed\r\nstatements of methods already described.[98]\r\n\r\n=116. Reagents.=—_Molybdate Solution._—One hundred and ten grams of\r\npure molybdic acid are dissolved in ammonia of nine-tenths specific\r\ngravity and diluted with water to one liter. The solution is poured\r\ninto one liter of nitric acid, of one and two-tenths specific gravity,\r\nand, after standing a few days, filtered.\r\n\r\n_Concentrated Ammonium Nitrate Solution._—Seven hundred and fifty grams\r\nof pure ammonium nitrate are dissolved in water and made up to one\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia Mixture._—Fifty-five grams of magnesium chlorid; seventy\r\ngrams of ammonium chlorid; 130 cubic centimeters of ammonia of\r\nnine-tenths specific gravity are dissolved and diluted with water to\r\none liter.\r\n\r\n_Two and One-Half Per Cent Ammonia._—One hundred cubic centimeters of\r\nammonia of nine-tenths specific gravity are diluted with water to one\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n_Joulie’s Citrate Solution._—Four hundred grams of citric acid are\r\ndissolved in ammonia of nine-tenths specific gravity and diluted to one\r\nliter with ammonia of the same strength.\r\n\r\n_Wagner’s Citrate Solution._—One hundred and fifty grams of citric acid\r\nare exactly neutralized with ammonia, then ten grams of citric acid\r\nadded and diluted to one liter with water.\r\n\r\n_Sodium Acetate Solution._—One hundred grams of sodium acetate,\r\ncrystallized, are dissolved in water, treated with 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of acetic acid, and diluted to one liter with water.\r\n\r\n_Calcium Phosphate Solution._—About ten grams of dry, pure tribasic\r\ncalcium phosphate are dissolved in nitric acid and diluted with water\r\nto one liter. In this solution the phosphoric acid is determined\r\ngravimetrically by the molybdate or citrate method, and the value of\r\nthe solution marked on the flask containing it.\r\n\r\n_Titrated Uranium Solution._—Two hundred and fifty grams of uranium\r\nnitrate are dissolved in water, twenty-five grams of sodium acetate\r\nadded, and the whole diluted to seven liters. One cubic centimeter of\r\nthis solution corresponds to about 0.005 gram of phosphorus pentoxid.\r\nIn order to determine its exact value proceed as follows: Twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the calcium phosphate solution which, for example,\r\nhas been found to contain 0.10317 gram of phosphorus pentoxid, are\r\nneutralized in a porcelain dish with ammonia, acidified with acetic,\r\ntreated with ten cubic centimeters of sodium acetate solution, and\r\nwarmed. Through a burette as much uranium solution is allowed to flow\r\nas is necessary to show in a drop of the solution taken out of the\r\ndish, when treated with a drop of pure potassium ferrocyanid, a slight\r\nbrown color. In order to be certain, this operation is repeated two or\r\nthree times with new quantities of twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\ncalcium phosphate solution. Example:\r\n\r\nTwenty-five cubic centimeters of the calcium phosphate solution\r\ncontaining 0.10317 gram of phosphorus pentoxid, gave as a mean of three\r\ndeterminations 23.2 cubic centimeters of the uranium solution necessary\r\nto produce the brown color with potassium ferrocyanid. Consequently\r\n0.10317 ÷ 23.2 = 0.00445 gram of phosphorus pentoxid equivalent\r\nto one cubic centimeter of uranium solution. If, for instance, a\r\nquantity of fertilizer weighing exactly five grams, require ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the uranium solution for the complete precipitation of\r\nits phosphoric acid, then the quantity of phosphoric acid contained in\r\nthe fertilizer would be equivalent to 10 × 0.0045, equivalent to 0.0445\r\ngram of phosphorus pentoxid. The fertilizer, therefore, contains eight\r\nand nine-tenths per cent of phosphorus pentoxid.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of the Molybdenum Method._—This method rests upon the\r\nprecipitation of the phosphorus pentoxid by a solution of ammonium\r\nmolybdate in nitric acid, solution of the precipitate in ammonia, and\r\nsubsequent precipitation with magnesia.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—Twenty-five or fifty cubic centimeters of a solution\r\nof the phosphate which has been made up to a standard volume and\r\ncontaining about one-tenth gram of phosphorus pentoxid, are placed\r\nin a beaker together with 100 cubic centimeters of the molybdate\r\nsolution and treated with as much ammonium nitrate solution as will be\r\nsufficient to give the liquid a content of fifteen per cent of ammonium\r\nnitrate. The contents of the beaker are well mixed and warmed for about\r\ntwenty minutes at from 60° to 80°. After cooling, they are filtered and\r\nthe precipitate washed on the filter with cold water until a drop of\r\nthe filtrate saturated with ammonia does not become opaque on treatment\r\nwith ammonium oxalate. The filtrate is then washed from the filter with\r\ntwo and one-half per cent ammonia solution and precipitated slowly and\r\nwith constant stirring by the magnesia mixture. After standing for two\r\nhours the ammonium magnesium phosphate is separated by filtration,\r\nwashed with two and one-half per cent ammonia until the filtrate\r\ncontains no more chlorin, and ignited.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of the Citrate Method._—The principle of this method depends\r\nupon the fact that when a sufficient quantity of ammonium citrate is\r\nadded to phosphate solutions, iron, alumina, and lime are retained in\r\nsolution when, on the addition of the magnesia mixture in the presence\r\nof free ammonia, the phosphoric acid is completely precipitated as\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—From ten to fifty cubic centimeters of the solution\r\nof the phosphate to be determined are treated with fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of the Joulie citrate solution avoiding warming. A few\r\npieces of filter-paper, the ash content of which is known, are thrown\r\nin and, with stirring, fifteen cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture\r\nslowly added and if necessary also some free ammonia. By the small\r\npieces of filter-paper the collection of the precipitate against\r\nthe sides of the vessel and on the stirring rod is prevented and in\r\nthis way the production of the precipitate hastened. After standing\r\nfrom one-half an hour to two hours the mixture is filtered, ignited,\r\nand weighed. If it be preferred to estimate the phosphoric acid by\r\ntitration, the precipitate is dissolved in a little nitric acid, made\r\nslightly alkaline with ammonia, and then acid with acetic and then\r\nafterwards titrated with the standard uranium solution.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of the Uranium Method._—The principle upon which this\r\nmethod rests depends upon the fact that uranium nitrate or acetate\r\nprecipitates uranium phosphate from solutions containing phosphoric\r\nacid and which contain no other free acid except acetic. In the\r\npresence of ammonium salts the precipitate is uranium ammonium\r\nphosphate having the formula PO₄NH₄UrO₂. The smallest excess of soluble\r\nuranium salt is at once detected by the ordinary treatment with\r\npotassium ferrocyanid.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—In all cases the solution is first made slightly\r\nalkaline with ammonia and then acid by a few drops of acetic, so that\r\nno free mineral acid may be present.\r\n\r\n(1) _With liquids free from iron_:\r\n\r\nIf, on the addition of ammonium or sodium acetate, no turbidity be\r\nproduced, the liquid is free from iron and alumina. In this case\r\nfrom ten to fifty cubic centimeters of the solution containing about\r\none-tenth gram of phosphorus pentoxid are treated with ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of sodium acetate, and afterwards with a quantity of\r\nuranium solution corresponding, as nearly as possible, to its supposed\r\ncontent of phosphorus pentoxid, and heated to boiling. From the heated\r\nliquid by means of a glass rod, one or two drops are taken and placed\r\nupon a porcelain plate and one drop of a freshly prepared solution of\r\npotassium ferrocyanid allowed to flow on it. If no brown color be seen\r\nat the point of contact of the two drops, additional quantities of\r\nthe uranium solution are added and, after boiling, again tested with\r\npotassium ferrocyanid until a brown color is distinctly visible. The\r\nquantity of the uranium solution thus having been determined, duplicate\r\nanalyses can be made and the whole quantity of the uranium solution\r\nadded at once with the exception of the last drops, which are added as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n(2) _Solutions containing iron and alumina._\r\n\r\nThe solution is treated with the ammonium citrate solution of Joulie,\r\nthe magnesia mixture added slowly, and the precipitate collected\r\non a filter and washed with two and one-half per cent ammonia. The\r\nprecipitate is then dissolved in nitric acid, made alkaline with\r\nammonia, and then acid with acetic. This solution is then treated with\r\nten cubic centimeters of sodium acetate and titrated with uranium, as\r\ndescribed in (1). As an alternative method, 200 cubic centimeters of\r\nthe superphosphate solution may be treated with fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof sodium acetate, allowed to stand for some time, and filtered through\r\na filter of known ash content. In fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate, which correspond to forty cubic centimeters of the original\r\nsolution, phosphoric acid may be determined as described above. The\r\nprecipitate, consisting of iron and aluminum phosphates, is washed\r\nthree times on the filter with boiling water, dried, and ignited in a\r\nplatinum dish. The weight of ignited precipitate, diminished by the\r\nweight of the ash contained in the filter and divided by two, gives the\r\nquantity of phosphorus pentoxid which it is necessary to add to that\r\nobtained by titration.\r\n\r\n=117. Determination of the Phosphoric Acid in all Phosphates and Basic\r\nSlags.=—\r\n\r\n(1) _Total phosphoric Acid_:\r\n\r\nFive grams of the fine phosphate meal, or slag meal, are moistened in\r\na flask of 500 cubic centimeters content with some water and boiled on\r\na sand-bath with forty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of from\r\n16° to 20° Beaumé. The boiling is continued until only a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of a thick jelly of silicic acid remain. After cooling,\r\nsome water is added and the phosphate shaken until the thick lumps\r\nof silica are finely divided. The flask is then filled to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters and its contents filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate are treated with fifteen cubic centimeters of the Joulie\r\nsolution and treated in the manner described with magnesia mixture,\r\nprecipitated, ignited, and weighed. The precipitate can also be\r\ndissolved and treated with uranium solution as described.\r\n\r\nThe method used by Oliveri may also be employed and it is carried out\r\nas indicated in the following description:[99]\r\n\r\nA weighed quantity of the slag is reduced to a fine powder. To five\r\ngrams of the sample is added three times its weight of potassium\r\nchlorate and the whole is intimately mixed. The mixture is then placed\r\nin a porcelain dish and hydrochloric acid is added, little by little,\r\nuntil the potash salt is completely decomposed. It is evaporated until\r\nthe mass is dry. The material is then treated with fuming nitric\r\nacid, and the determination of the phosphorus is made by the ordinary\r\ngravimetric method.\r\n\r\nBy carrying on the operation as described above, a reduction of\r\nphosphoric acid is avoided, and the presence of an abundant quantity\r\nof potash prevents the formation of basic iron phosphate which is\r\ninsoluble in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n(2) _Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—One gram of the basic slag\r\nor phosphate is placed in a 100 cubic centimeter flask and covered\r\nwith Wagner’s acid citrate solution making the total volume up to\r\n100 cubic centimeters. With frequent shaking the flask is kept at\r\n40° for an hour, or it may be allowed to stand for twelve hours at\r\nroom temperature with frequent shaking. In fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate from this flask the phosphoric acid is determined by\r\nthe magnesia mixture as described. Since, in the present case, the\r\nprecipitate of ammonium magnesium phosphate contains some silicic\r\nacid it cannot be directly ignited but must be treated in the\r\nfollowing manner: The precipitate and the filter are thrown into a\r\nporcelain dish, the filter-paper torn up into shreds with a glass\r\nrod, the precipitate dissolved in nitric acid, neutralized with\r\nammonia, acidified with acetic, and treated with uranium solution.\r\nThe phosphoric acid may also be estimated by the gravimetric method\r\nby dissolving the precipitate again in hydrochloric or nitric acid,\r\nevaporating to dryness, and drying for one hour at from 110° to 120°,\r\ndissolving again in hydrochloric acid, filtering, and washing the\r\nprecipitate well. The filtrate, which is now free from silica, can be\r\ntreated with Joulie’s solution, precipitated with magnesia mixture, the\r\nprecipitate washed, ignited, and weighed as described. The molybdenum\r\nmethod is preferred in the estimation of citrate-soluble phosphoric\r\nacid, especially in slags. For this purpose fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate from the solution of one gram of slag in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of Wagner’s citrate liquid are treated with 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of molybdenum solution and thirty cubic centimeters of\r\nammonium nitrate solution, warmed for twenty minutes at 80°, filtered\r\nafter cooling, and the yellow precipitate washed with cold water. The\r\nwater will gradually dissolve all the silicic acid from the yellow\r\nprecipitate and carry it into the filtrate. The yellow precipitate\r\nis then dissolved in two and one-half per cent liquid ammonia and\r\nprecipitated with magnesia mixture and the precipitate washed, ignited,\r\nand weighed in the way described.\r\n\r\n=118. Determination of Phosphoric Acid in Superphosphates.=—(1)\r\n_Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—Five grams of the superphosphate are\r\nrubbed with 100 cubic centimeters of Wagner’s acid citrate solution in\r\na mortar and washed into a flask of 500 cubic centimeters content and\r\ndiluted to 500 cubic centimeters with water. With frequent shaking the\r\nflask is allowed to stand for twelve hours, after which its contents\r\nare filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate are treated\r\nwith ten cubic centimeters of the Joulie solution and fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of the magnesia mixture and, if necessary, made distinctly\r\nalkaline with ammonia, vigorously stirred, and, after two hours,\r\nfiltered. The precipitate is washed, ignited, and weighed as described,\r\nor titrated, after solution in nitric acid and the addition of sodium\r\nacetate, with uranium solution.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n      The weighed precipitate has 0.1272 gram Mg₂P₂O₇ then the phosphate\r\n      contains 12.72 × 2 × 0.64 = 16.28 per cent of citrate-soluble P₂O₅.\r\n\r\n(2) _Water-Soluble Phosphoric Acid._—Twenty grams of superphosphate\r\nare rubbed in a mortar and washed into a flask of one liter content\r\nand made up to the mark with water. After two hours’ digestion with\r\nfrequent shaking, the contents of the flask are filtered through a\r\nfolded filter. Twenty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate equivalent\r\nto five-tenths gram of the substance are precipitated with magnesia\r\nmixture, the precipitate filtered, washed, ignited, and weighed, or the\r\nmoist filtrate may be dissolved upon the filter with a little nitric\r\nacid, treated with sodium acetate, and titrated, as described, with\r\nuranium solution.\r\n\r\nExample: 14.5 cubic centimeters of the uranium solution are required\r\nfor the precipitate from twenty-five cubic centimeters of the original\r\nsolution = 0.5 gram superphosphate; it contains then 14.5 × 0.00445 =\r\n0.0645 gram P₂O₅. Consequently the superphosphate contains 12.90 per\r\ncent of water-soluble P₂O₅.\r\n\r\n_Total Phosphoric Add._—Twenty grams of the superphosphate are boiled\r\nwith fifty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of from 16° to 18°\r\nBeaumé for about ten minutes and, after cooling, made up to one liter\r\nwith water and filtered. Twenty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nare treated with ten cubic centimeters of Joulie’s citrate solution,\r\na few pieces of filter-paper thrown in, fifteen cubic centimeters\r\nof magnesia mixture added, and the whole thoroughly stirred. After\r\nstanding two hours the contents of the flask are filtered and the\r\nprecipitate is washed with dilute ammonia and the filter and the\r\nprecipitate are placed in a platinum crucible. The crucible is heated\r\nslowly until the moisture is driven off and the filter burned. Then the\r\ntemperature is gradually raised to a white heat. The residue is cooled\r\nand weighed. Example:\r\n\r\nThe precipitate weighs, after the subtraction of the filter ash, 0.1390\r\ngram; then the superphosphate contains 13.90 × 2 × 0.64 = 17.79 per\r\ncent phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON PHOSPHATES AND PHOSPHATIC FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n=119. Time Required for Precipitation of Phosphoric Acid.=—The length\r\nof time required for the complete precipitation of the phosphoric acid\r\nby molybdate mixture is perhaps much less than generally supposed.\r\nAt 65° the precipitation, as shown by de Roode, is complete in five\r\nminutes.[100] In a given case the weight of pyrophosphate obtained\r\nafter five minutes was 0.0676 gram, and exactly the same weight was\r\nfound after twenty-four hours. In view of these facts analysts would\r\noften be able to save time by omitting the delay usually demanded by\r\nthe setting aside of the yellow precipitate for a few hours in order\r\nto secure a complete separation of the phosphoric acid. In the method\r\nof the official chemists it is directed that the digestion at 65° be\r\ncontinued for one hour, and this time may possibly be shortened with\r\nadvantage. In all cases, however, where there is any doubt in regard to\r\nthe complete separation, some of the molybdate solution should be added\r\nto the filtrate and, with renewed digestion, it should be noted whether\r\nany additional precipitate be formed.\r\n\r\n=120. Examination of the Pyrophosphate.=—In fertilizer control it is\r\nnot usually thought necessary to examine the magnesium pyrophosphate\r\nfor impurities. Among those most likely to be found is silica. It\r\nis proper, in all cases where accuracy is required, to dissolve the\r\nprecipitate in nitric acid, boil for some time to convert the pyro-\r\ninto orthophosphate, and reprecipitate with molybdate and magnesia\r\nmixture. This treatment will separate the silica which remains\r\npractically insoluble after the first ignition. It has been observed\r\nby some analysts that the results obtained by the official method are\r\na trifle too high and also that on re-solution the second precipitate\r\nof pyrophosphate weighs less than the first.[101] The difference in\r\nmost cases is very little but it may become a quantity of considerable\r\nmagnitude in samples where soluble silica is found in notable\r\nquantities. The danger of contamination with iron, alumina, and arsenic\r\nhas already been mentioned but it is not of sufficient importance to\r\nwarrant further attention.\r\n\r\n=121. Iodin in Phosphates.=—The presence of iodin has been detected in\r\nmany natural phosphates and is of interest in the discussion of the\r\nproblem of their origin.[102] A qualitative test for the detection\r\nof iodin may be applied in the following manner: Some finely ground\r\nphosphate is mixed with strong sulfuric acid and the gases arising from\r\nthe reaction are aspired into some carbon disulfid or chloroform. The\r\nviolet coloration arising indicates the presence of iodin. The gases\r\ncarrying the iodin may also be brought into contact with starch-paste\r\nproducing the well-known blue color.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of iodin present in a phosphate is rarely more than one or\r\ntwo-tenths of one per cent. It can be determined as a silver salt, in\r\nthe absence of chlorin or by any of the standard methods found in works\r\non qualitative analysis.\r\n\r\nIodin is quite a constant constituent of Florida phosphates.\r\n\r\nFor a quantitative determination, the sample is treated with an excess\r\nof strong sulfuric acid in a closed flask and during the decomposition\r\na stream of air is aspired through the flask and caused to bubble\r\nthrough absorption bulbs containing sodium hydroxid in solution.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the decomposition may be raised to about 200°.\r\nAfter the solution of the sample the sodium iodid formed is oxidized\r\nby heating with potassium permanganate, acidulated and mixed with a\r\nsolution of potassium iodid to hold the free iodin in solution. The\r\nfree iodin is determined in the usual way by titration with standard\r\nsodium thiosulfate solution. The reactions preparatory to the titration\r\nare represented by the following formulas:\r\n\r\n           2KI + H₂SO₄ = K₂SO₄ + 2HI.\r\n           2HI + H₂SO₄ = 2H₂O + SO₂ + 2I.\r\n            6I + 6NaOH = NaIO₃ + 5NaI + 3H₂O.\r\n    NaI + 2KMnO₄ + H₂O = NaIO₃ + 2KOH + 2MnO₂.\r\n            HIO₃ + 5HI = 6I + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe titration is represented by the following reaction:\r\n\r\n    2Na₂S₂O₂ + 2I = 2NaI + 2NaI + Na₂S₄O₄.\r\n\r\nThe decinormal solution of sodium thiosulfate may be used. Grind the\r\ncrystals of the salt to a fine powder, dry between blotting papers,\r\nand use 24.8 grams of the dried salt per liter. The quantity of iodin\r\nfound in phosphates is so minute that it is hardly worth while to make\r\na quantitative determination of it.\r\n\r\n=122. Occurrence of Chromium in Phosphates.=—In some phosphates a small\r\nquantity of chromium has been found. In a sample of phosphate from the\r\nIsland of Los Roques in the Caribbean Sea, Gilbert found three-fourths\r\nper cent of chromium oxid (Cr₂O₃). The phosphates containing chromium\r\nhave a greenish color and are characterized by great insolubility in\r\nsolutions containing organic acids. The chromium is to be determined by\r\nthe usual methods described in mineral analysis.\r\n\r\n=123. Estimation of Vanadium.=—In the complete analysis of basic slags\r\nit becomes necessary to determine the presence of vanadium and its\r\nquantity. The method used in this laboratory for the purpose is the\r\nvolumetric process of Lindemann.[103] It is conducted as follows:\r\nDissolve four grams of the finely powdered slag in sixty cubic\r\ncentimeters of dilute sulfuric acid (1: 4), boil for a few minutes,\r\ncool, make the volume up to 100 cubic centimeters, filter, and take\r\nan aliquot part for the determination. Add decinormal potassium\r\npermanganate solution in slight excess to secure the oxidation of the\r\nvanadium to vanadium pentoxid. Add, drop by drop, a weak solution of\r\nferrous sulfate until the pink color just disappears. Prepare a ferrous\r\nsulfate solution by dissolving 2.183 grams of piano wire in sulfuric\r\nacid and making the volume to one liter. Titrate the vanadic mixture\r\nwith this solution until a drop of the clear liquor removed and brought\r\nin contact with potassium ferricyanid shows a distinctive blue-green\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of the ferrous sulfate solution is equivalent to\r\n0.002 gram of vanadium, 0.002888 gram of vanadium dioxid, and 0.003648\r\ngram of vanadium pentoxid. The ferrous sulfate solution may also be\r\nmade and standardized by any of the approved methods in common use.\r\n\r\nThe method described by Blair, designed especially for the estimation\r\nof vanadium in iron and steel, is conducted in the following\r\nmanner:[104] Five grams of the drillings are dissolved in fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric acid of 1.24 specific gravity. The solution is\r\nevaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish and heated thereafter until\r\nthe nitrates are nearly decomposed. After cooling, the dried mass is\r\ntransferred to a mortar and finely ground with thirty grams of dry\r\nsodium carbonate and three grams of sodium nitrate. The finely ground\r\nmaterials are placed in a platinum dish and fused for an hour at a\r\nhigh temperature. Spread the fused mass over the sides of the dish\r\nwhile cooling, and afterwards dissolve in hot water, filter, and wash\r\nuntil the volume is a little over half a liter. Add nitric acid to\r\ndecompose carbonates, but not completely, and boil to get rid of carbon\r\ndioxid, being careful to keep the mass always slightly alkaline. Add\r\nnitric acid, drop by drop, until slightly in excess, and then sodium\r\ncarbonate to marked alkalinity, boil, and filter. Add a slight excess\r\nof nitric acid to the filtrate, and the development of a yellow color\r\nwill indicate the presence of vanadic acid. Add to the solution a\r\nsmall quantity of mercurous nitrate and then an excess of mercuric\r\noxid, suspended in water to render the solution neutral and insure the\r\ncomplete precipitation of mercurous vanadate. The mercurous salt also\r\nprecipitates phosphoric, chromic, tungstic, and molybdic acids which\r\nmay be present. Boil, filter, and wash the precipitate with hot water,\r\ndry, and ignite. Fuse the residue with sodium carbonate and a little\r\nnitrate. Dissolve the fused mass, after cooling, in a little water and\r\nfilter. Add to the filtrate, ammonium chlorid in excess, from three to\r\nfive grams for each 100 cubic centimeters of the solution, and allow\r\nto stand, with occasional stirring, for some time. Ammonium vanadate,\r\ninsoluble in a saturated solution of ammonium chlorid, separates as\r\na white powder. It is necessary to keep the solution alkaline, and a\r\ndrop of ammonia should be added from time to time for this purpose. The\r\nappearance of a yellowish tint at any time indicates that the solution\r\nhas become acid, and this acidity must be corrected, or else the\r\nresults will be too low. Separate the ammonium vanadate by filtration;\r\nwash first with a saturated solution of ammonium chlorid containing a\r\nlittle free ammonia, and then with alcohol. Dry, ignite, and moisten\r\nwith a few drops of nitric acid; again ignite to obtain the compound as\r\nvanadium pentoxid. This compound contains 56.22 per cent of vanadium.\r\nThe method of Rosenheim and Holversheet may also be used.[105] It is\r\nbased on the preliminary precipitation of the vanadic acid as a barium\r\nor lead salt. The substance supposed to contain vanadium is first\r\nbrought into solution in such a manner as to secure it as vanadic acid,\r\nwhich is then precipitated with barium chlorid or lead acetate. The\r\nprecipitate is boiled with hydrochloric acid and potassium bromid, and\r\nthe liberated bromin determined by the quantity of iodin set free from\r\npotassium iodid. In the absence of bodies, such as molybdic acid, which\r\nare reduced by sulfurous acid or hydrogen sulfid, the vanadic acid\r\nmay also be determined by reducing it with one of these reagents and,\r\nafter removing the excess by boiling, titrating the vanadium tetroxid\r\nwith potassium permanganate. When vanadic and phosphoric acids occur\r\ntogether the former may be first reduced to tetroxid with sulfurous\r\nacid, and after expelling excess of this reagent, the phosphoric acid\r\nmay be separated with molybdate solution and removed by filtration.\r\nWhen the amount of vanadic acid is large the phosphoric acid should\r\nbe separated rapidly at 55°-60°, using a considerable excess of the\r\nmolybdate; or the vanadic acid may first be determined in the solution\r\nvolumetrically by the bromin process above described, and afterwards\r\nthe phosphoric acid obtained by evaporating to dryness with a little\r\nsulfuric acid, taking the residue up with water, reducing the vanadic\r\nwith sulfurous acid and precipitating the phosphoric acid with\r\nmolybdate solution as described above.\r\n\r\n=124. Fluorin in Bones.=—Fluorin is not only a constituent of mineral\r\nphosphates but also of bones. According to the researches of Carnot\r\nthere is often as much as one-half per cent of calcium fluorid in bones\r\nand teeth.[106] Gabriel has suggested a means of determining a minimum\r\nlimit of fluorin in bones and teeth by the development of etchings in\r\ncomparison with known quantities of pure calcium fluorid. The minimum\r\nquantity of calcium fluorid necessary to produce a distinct etching, in\r\nknown conditions, having been determined, the test is applied to known\r\nweights of ignited bone or teeth. He concludes from his results, that\r\nthe ash of bones and teeth often contains less than one-tenth per cent\r\nof fluorin. Since, however, there is a loss of fluorin from calcium\r\nfluorid, on ignition, the whole of the fluorin may not have been\r\navailable in the tests described.\r\n\r\n=125. Note on the Separation of Iron and Aluminum Phosphates from\r\nthe Calcium Compound.=—There are many points of difference noted in\r\nthe descriptions given by authors of the deportment of the iron, and\r\naluminum phosphates in presence of a large excess of the calcium salt.\r\nEspecially is this true of the statements made by Hess and Glaser[107]\r\nin paragraphs =34= and =35=. The subject is of such importance, from an\r\nanalytical point of view, as to merit a careful study.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory a thorough investigation of the mutual deportment\r\nof these three phosphates has been made by Brown with the following\r\nresults:[108] When a mixture containing a known weight of the salts\r\nwas treated exactly as Hess directs, in no case was there a complete\r\nseparation of the iron aluminum phosphate from the calcium salt. In\r\norder to discover the cause of the failure, pure solutions of calcium\r\nand iron aluminum phosphates were treated under identical conditions\r\nby the necessary reagents. Fifty cubic centimeters of a solution of\r\ncalcium phosphate, containing about one gram of the salt, were treated\r\nwith 100 cubic centimeters of water and fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe commercial ammonium acetate containing 150 grams of the salt in a\r\nliter. An immediate precipitate was produced at ordinary temperature,\r\nand on heating to 60° it became abundant. The addition of ammonium\r\nchlorid, phosphate, and nitrate in successive portions, does not\r\nprevent the precipitation. Making the solution more dilute lessens the\r\ndifficulty when twenty cubic centimeters of a ten per cent solution\r\nof ammonium phosphate are first added, followed by the usual quantity\r\nof ammonium acetate; a clear crystalline precipitate is sometimes\r\nobserved. Experience also shows that the trouble is not due to an\r\nexcess of the ammonium acetate.\r\n\r\nIn treating a solution of iron aluminum phosphate, in similar\r\ncircumstances, with the ammonium acetate, it is found that a complete\r\nprecipitation takes place.\r\n\r\nSince diluting the solution of the calcium salt diminishes its tendency\r\nto form a precipitate with the ammonium acetate the true method of\r\nseparation seems to lie in that direction. The calcium salt is held\r\ncompletely in solution when the separation is made in the following way.\r\n\r\nThe solution containing the mixed phosphates is diluted so as to\r\ncontain not more than one gram thereof in half a liter. To this is\r\nadded one drop of dimethylanilin orange, and afterwards ammonium\r\nhydroxid, until a very slight precipitate is formed. The mixture is\r\nheated to 70° and from twenty to twenty-five cubic centimeters of a\r\ntwenty-five per cent solution of acid ammonium acetate are added,\r\nenough to change the rose color of the indicator to orange. The iron\r\naluminum phosphate is separated by filtration and washed with a hot\r\nfive per cent solution of ammonium nitrate.\r\n\r\nThe washed precipitate shows no impurity due to calcium, as proved\r\nby dissolving it, reprecipitating and filtering, adding ammonium\r\nhydroxid to the filtrate, and heating for a long time. Sometimes a\r\nslight troubling of the clear liquid may be observed which may be due\r\nto a slight solubility of the iron aluminum phosphate in washing, an\r\naccident that may occur if the temperature be allowed to fall below\r\n70°, but no weighable amount of material is obtained. If due to\r\ncalcium phosphate, a greater dilution in the first precipitation will\r\nremove even this mere trace of that salt. In the above conditions the\r\ncontamination of the iron aluminum precipitate with calcium phosphate\r\nmay be entirely avoided. We had also undertaken here the problem of\r\nseparating the phosphoric acid by the citrate method, followed by a\r\ndestruction of the citric acid in the filtrate by combustion with\r\nsulfuric acid according to the kjeldahl process, and final separation\r\nof the iron and alumina in the residues when our attention was called\r\nto substantially the same process as described by Jean.[109] The method\r\nmerits a further critical examination.\r\n\r\n=126. Phosphoric Acid Soluble in Ammonium Citrate.=—There is no other\r\npoint connected with the determination of phosphoric acid which has\r\nexcited so much discussion and about which there is such difference of\r\nopinion as the solubility of phosphates in ammonium citrate. It was\r\nclearly established by Huston, in 1882, that the ammonium citrate, as\r\nused in fertilizer analysis, would attack normal tricalcium phosphate\r\nas it exists in bones.[110]\r\n\r\nIn a raw bone, finely ground, containing 20.28 per cent of phosphoric\r\nacid, the following quantities were found to be soluble in a neutral\r\nammonium citrate solution of 1.09 specific gravity.\r\n\r\n                             Time of digestion, thirty minutes.\r\n    Temperature                30°       40°       50°      60°\r\n    Per cent P₂O₅ dissolved   2.76      4.01      3.39     5.88\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the quantity of acid dissolved increases with\r\nthe temperature of digestion with the exception of the number obtained\r\nat 50°. When the time of digestion was increased there was also found\r\na progressive increase in the amount of acid passing into solution. At\r\n40° for forty-five minutes the per cent dissolved was 4.97, and at 40°\r\nfor one hour it was 5.92. These early determinations had the effect\r\nof calling attention to the thoroughly empirical process which was in\r\nuse, in many modified forms, by agricultural chemists, the world over\r\nfor determining so-called reverted phosphoric acid in fertilizers.\r\nSince the publication of the paper above named many investigations have\r\nbeen undertaken by Huston and others relating to this matter.[111]\r\nThe general results of these studies, tabulated by Huston, are given\r\nbelow.[112]\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE TIME OF DIGESTION.\r\n\r\n    (A) = Temperature, degrees C.\r\n    (B) = Citrate-soluble phosphoric acid.\r\n    (C) = Total phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n     Material.

While each authority\r\nof value upon the subject is represented, no attempt has been made\r\nto include all the work done by any of them. One element that seems\r\nto have been generally overlooked in discussing the problem is that\r\nnearly all results have been obtained from one-half hour’s treatment of\r\nthe material. This means simply the study of an incomplete reaction,\r\nand one which is interrupted while the solution is very rapidly going\r\non. This, of course, is only clearly brought out by a comparison of\r\nlong-time and short-time work in the various tables. In the opinion\r\nof Huston very much more work will have to be done before it can be\r\nassumed that we have any very clear knowledge of this subject, and\r\nvery likely the final result will be that all kinds of goods cannot be\r\nexamined by the same method. The fact that half a gram of dicalcium\r\nphosphate is instantly soluble in 100 cubic centimeters of citrate\r\nsolution, at ordinary temperatures, while an equal amount of iron and\r\naluminum phosphate is acted upon very slowly at ordinary temperatures\r\nwill probably have to be taken into consideration, as well as the fact\r\nthat dicalcium phosphate is less soluble in hot solutions of ammonium\r\ncitrate than it is in cold solutions, while the reverse is true of the\r\nprecipitated iron and aluminum phosphate.\r\n\r\nAt present, the only conclusion that can be safely drawn from the work,\r\nis that it would be unsafe to make any generalization upon the subject\r\nuntil more facts are at hand, except that the present methods are\r\nunscientific and, unsatisfactory. As the work progresses, new features\r\npresent themselves, and in such a way as to show that they must be\r\ngiven careful consideration before drawing any final conclusions in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n=127. Arbitrary Determination of Reverted Phosphoric Acid.=—The\r\nso-called reverted phosphoric acid, that is, the acid insoluble in\r\nwater and soluble in a solution of ammonium citrate, is the most\r\ndifficult constituent of commercial fertilizers from the point of\r\nview of the scientific analyst. A review of all the standard methods\r\nwhich have been given in the preceding pages for its determination\r\nmust convince every careful observer that, as a rule, each process is\r\nbased on arbitrary standards, and can give only concordant results when\r\ncarried out under strictly unvarying conditions. For this reason there\r\ncan be no just comparison between the results obtained by different\r\nmethods, which vary from each other only in slight particulars.\r\nWhen, on the other hand, the processes are radically different, the\r\ndeviations in data become more pronounced.\r\n\r\nIn such a condition of affairs the analyst is left to choose between\r\nmethods. He must be guided in his choice not only by what seems to\r\nbe the most scientific and accurate process, but also, to a certain\r\nextent, by the general practice of his professional brethren. For this\r\ncountry, therefore, it is strongly urged that the methods adopted by\r\nthe Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, be followed in every\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nBy the phrase “reverted phosphoric acid,” was originally meant an acid\r\nonce soluble in water, as CaH₄(PO₄)₂, and afterwards changed to a form\r\ninsoluble in water, but soluble in ammonium citrate as Ca₂H₂(PO₄)₂. But\r\nin practice this has never been the true signification of the term.\r\nIn the manufacture of acid and superphosphates there is formed, more\r\nor less of the dicalcium phosphate, either directly or after a time,\r\nand this salt which, in no sense can be called reverted, is entirely\r\nsoluble in ammonium citrate. The iron and aluminum phosphates are\r\nalso, to a certain degree, soluble in the same reagent. When an acid\r\nphosphate, containing various forms of calcium phosphate, is applied to\r\na soil containing iron and alumina, the soluble parts of the compound\r\ntend to become fixed by union with those bases, or by precipitation as\r\nCa₂H₂(PO₄)₂. But it is not alone reverted phosphate formed in this way,\r\nwhich the analyst is called on to determine in a fertilizer, although\r\nhe may have occasion to treat it in soil analysis.\r\n\r\nThe expression “reverted phosphoric acid,” therefore, in practice not\r\nonly includes a dicalcium phosphate, which once may have been the\r\nmonocalcium salt, but also all of that salt originally existing in\r\nthe superphosphate, and formed directly during its manufacture, as\r\nwell as any iron and aluminum phosphates present which are soluble in\r\nammonium citrate. The expression “citrate-soluble” is, therefore, to be\r\npreferred to “reverted” phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn the reversion of the phosphoric acid in superphosphates the iron\r\nplays a far more important role than the aluminum sulfate. It was\r\nformerly supposed that the reversion took place as indicated in the\r\nfollowing formula: 2CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + Fe₂O₃ = 2(CaHPO₄, FePO₄) + 3H₂O, while\r\nWagner affirms that the reverted acid compounds consist of varying\r\nquantities of ferric oxid, aluminum oxid, phosphorus pentoxid, and\r\ncalcium oxid, in various states of combination.[117] The more probable\r\nreaction is the following: 3CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 4H₂O = 2(FePO₄,\r\n2H₃PO₄, 2H₂O) + 3CaSO₄. This reaction can be demonstrated by adding\r\nto a superphosphate solution one of a ferric salt. In addition to\r\nfree phosphoric acid, iron phosphate is separated, which gradually\r\npasses into an insoluble form by the abstraction of water due to the\r\ncrystallization of the gypsum. The alumina present in a superphosphate\r\nseems to have no direct influence on the process of reversion. Its\r\nphosphate salt is not acted on by the acid calcium phosphate. Even when\r\na superphosphate solution is treated with alum no precipitation is\r\nproduced, except on warming, and this disappears when the mass is again\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not necessary in the process of manufacture to separate\r\nthe alumina by digestion with a hot soda-lye before treating the mass\r\nwith sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the reversion of the phosphoric acid several plans\r\nhave been proposed. One of the best is to use a little excess of\r\nsulfuric acid in the manufacture. This tends to hold the phosphoric\r\nacid in soluble form but is objectionable on account of drying,\r\nhandling, and shipping the fertilizer. During the digestion, moreover,\r\nit is important that the temperature does not rise above 120°. Another\r\nmethod consists in adding to the dissolved rock a quantity of common\r\nsalt chemically equivalent to its iron content. Ammonium sulfate also\r\nhelps to hold the phosphoric acid water-soluble.\r\n\r\n=128. Influence of Movement.=—The influence of time and temperature\r\nof digestion, and of variations in the composition of the ammonium\r\ncitrate on the quantity of phosphoric acid dissolved by that reagent\r\nhas been pointed out. Of great importance also in the process is\r\nthe character of the movement to which the materials are subjected\r\nduring the digestion. For this reason various mechanical devices have\r\nbeen constructed to secure uniformity of solution. Inasmuch as the\r\ntemperature factor must also be faithfully observed, the best of these\r\ndevices are so arranged as to admit of a uniform motion within a bath\r\nof water kept at the desired temperature which, by the Association\r\nmethod, is 65°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8. HUSTON’S DIGESTING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n=129. Digestion Apparatus for Reverted Phosphates.=—The digestion\r\napparatus used by Huston consists of two wheels twenty-five centimeters\r\nin diameter, mounted on the same axis, having a clear space of four and\r\none-half centimeters between them.[118] In the periphery of each wheel\r\nare cut twelve notches, which are to receive the posts bearing the\r\nrings through which the necks of the flasks pass. The posts are held in\r\nplace by nuts which are screwed down on the faces of the wheel. Should\r\nit become necessary to take the apparatus apart, it is only necessary\r\nto loosen the nuts and the set screw holding one wheel to the shaft and\r\nall the parts can at once be removed. The posts extend ten centimeters\r\nbeyond the face of the wheels, and the rings are four centimeters in\r\ninternal diameter. Perforated plates, bearing a cross-bar, and held in\r\nplace by strong spiral springs attached to the plate and the base of\r\nthe posts, serve to hold the flasks in place. Each plate has a number\r\nstenciled through it for convenience in identifying the flasks when it\r\nis time to remove them. Attached to the outside of each post, close\r\nto the outer end, is a heavy wire which passes entirely around the\r\napparatus, serving to keep the plates in place after they are removed\r\nfrom the flasks.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is mounted on a substantial framework, thirty-six\r\ncentimeters high and thirty centimeters wide at the base. The space\r\nin which the wheel revolves is fourteen centimeters wide. The base\r\nbars connecting the two sides are extended seven centimeters beyond\r\none side, and serve for the attachment of lateral bracing. At the top\r\nof the framework, at one side, is attached a heavy bar forty-five\r\ncentimeters long, which serves to carry the cog gearing which transmits\r\nthe power. The upright shaft carries a cone pulley to provide for\r\nvarying the speed. The usual speed is two revolutions a minute for the\r\nwheel carrying the flasks. The entire apparatus is made of brass. The\r\ndetails of construction are shown in Fig. 8. Round-bottomed flasks are\r\nused, and rubber stoppers are held in place by tying or by a special\r\nclamp shown at the lower right-hand of the figure.\r\n\r\nWhen high temperatures are used, the plates and flasks are handled by\r\nthe hooks shown at the left and right-hand upper corners of the figure.\r\n\r\nWhen any other than room temperature is desired, the whole apparatus is\r\nimmersed in water contained in the large galvanized tank forming the\r\nback-ground of the figures. The tank is seventy-five centimeters long,\r\nseventy-five centimeters high, and thirty centimeters wide. At one end,\r\nnear the top, is an extension to provide space for heating the fluid in\r\nthe flasks before introducing the solid in such cases as may be desired.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is held in place by angle irons soldered to the bottom\r\nof the tank and a brace resting against the upright bar bearing the\r\ngear-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe water in the tank is heated by injecting steam, or by burners under\r\nthe tank. As the tank holds about 300 pounds of water the work is not\r\nsubject to sudden changes of temperature, and little trouble has been\r\nexperienced in raising and maintaining the temperature of the water,\r\nespecially when steam is used.\r\n\r\nAn electric motor, or a small water-motor with only a very moderate\r\nhead of water, will furnish ample power.\r\n\r\n=130.

Huston’s Mechanical Stirrer.=—The stirring apparatus shown in\r\nFig. 9 differs from those which have heretofore come into use, in\r\nrequiring but a single belt to drive all the stirring rods, and in\r\nhaving all the parts protected from the laboratory fumes.[119] The\r\ndetails of the belt system are shown in the small diagram in the lower\r\ncentral part of the figure. The apparatus is mounted on a substantial\r\nwooden box, 200 centimeters long, thirty centimeters high, and eighteen\r\ncentimeters wide. The driving pulleys, ten centimeters in diameter,\r\nare enclosed in the upper part of the case. The shafts on which these\r\npulleys are mounted extend through the bottom of the enclosing box\r\nand carry a wooden disk, eleven centimeters in diameter, to prevent\r\nparticles of foreign matter from falling into the beakers. The shafts\r\nextend two centimeters below these disks, and to the end of the shafts\r\nthe bent stirring rods are attached by rubber tubing.\r\n\r\nThe board forming the support of the driving pulleys is extended two\r\ncentimeters in front of the apparatus, and in this extension twelve\r\nnotches are cut, in which are held the corks carrying the tubes which\r\ncontain the solution to be used in precipitating the material in the\r\nbeakers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9. HUSTON’S MECHANICAL STIRRER.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of these tubes are drawn out to a fine point so as to deliver\r\nthe liquid at the rate of about one drop per second.\r\n\r\nThe front of the apparatus is hinged and permits the whole to be closed\r\nwhen not in use, or during the precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus has proven extremely satisfactory in the precipitation of\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate. The precipitate is very crystalline, and\r\nwhere the stirring is continued for some minutes, after the magnesia\r\nsolution has all been added, no amorphous precipitate is observed on\r\nlonger standing.\r\n\r\n=132. The Citrate Method Applied to Samples with Small Content of\r\nPhosphoric Acid.=—It is well established that the citrate method does\r\nnot give satisfactory results when applied to samples containing small\r\npercentages of phosphoric acid, especially when these are of an organic\r\nnature, as for instance, cottonseed cake-meal. In this laboratory\r\nattempts have been made to remedy this defect in the process so as\r\nto render the use of the method possible even in such cases.[120]\r\nSatisfactory results have been obtained by adding to the solution\r\nof the cake-meal a definite volume of a phosphate solution of known\r\nstrength. Solutions of ordinary mineral phosphates are preferred for\r\nthis purpose. The following example will show the application of the\r\nmodified method:\r\n\r\nIn a sample of cake-meal, (cottonseed cake and castor pomace) the\r\ncontent of phosphoric acid obtained by the molybdate method, was 2.52\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nDetermined directly by the citrate method, the following data were\r\nobtained:\r\n\r\nAllowing to stand thirty hours after adding magnesia mixture, 1.08 and\r\n1.53 per cent in duplicates.\r\n\r\nAllowing to stand seventy-two hours after adding magnesia mixture, 2.17\r\nand 2.30 per cent in duplicates.\r\n\r\nIn each case fifty cubic centimeters of the solution were taken,\r\nrepresenting half a gram of the sample.\r\n\r\nIn another series of determinations twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\nthe sample were mixed with an equal volume of a mineral phosphate\r\nsolution, the value of which had been previously determined by both\r\nthe molybdic and citrate methods. The fifty cubic centimeters thus\r\nobtained represented a quarter of a gram each of the cake-meal and\r\nmineral phosphates. The filtration followed eighteen hours after adding\r\nthe magnesia mixture. The following data show the results of the\r\ndeterminations:\r\n\r\n        Per cent      Per cent    Per cent     Per cent\r\n         P₂O₅ in       P₂O₅ in      P₂O₅        P₂O₅ in\r\n         mineral       organic    found in     organic\r\n        phosphate.     sample.   mixture × 2.   sample.\r\n\r\n    1     15.37         2.52       17.90        2.53\r\n    2     29.16         2.52       31.68        2.52\r\n    3     31.37         2.52       33.83        2.45\r\n    4     31.58         2.52       34.20        2.62\r\n                                                ----\r\n        Mean content of P₂O₅ in organic sample  2.53\r\n\r\nIt is thus demonstrated that the citrate method can be applied with\r\nsafety even to the determination of the phosphoric acid in organic\r\ncompounds where the quantity present is less than three per cent. It is\r\nfurther shown that solutions of mineral phosphates varying in content\r\nof phosphoric acid from fifteen to thirty-two per cent may be safely\r\nused for increasing the content of that acid to the proper degree for\r\ncomplete precipitation. In cases where organic matters are present they\r\nshould be destroyed by moist combustion with sulfuric acid as in the\r\ndetermination of nitrogen to be described in the next part.\r\n\r\n=133. Direct Precipitation of the Citrate-Soluble Phosphoric Acid.=—The\r\ndirect determination of citrate-soluble phosphoric acid by effecting\r\nthe precipitation by means of magnesia mixture in the solution obtained\r\nfrom the ammonium citrate digestion, has been practiced for many years\r\nby numbers of European chemists, and the process has even obtained\r\na place in the official methods of some European countries. Various\r\nobjections have been urged, however, against the general employment of\r\nthis method in fertilizer analysis on account of the inaccuracies in\r\nthe results obtained in certain cases, and it has, therefore, been used\r\nto but a very limited extent in this country. Since it is impracticable\r\nto effect the precipitation with ammonium molybdate in the presence of\r\ncitric acid the previous elimination or destruction of this substance\r\nhas been recognized as essential to the execution of a process\r\ninvolving the separation of the phosphoric acid as phosphomolybdate.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the data cited in the preceding paragraph, that\r\ngreat accuracy may be secured in this process by adding a sufficient\r\nquantity of a solution of a mineral phosphate and proceeding by the\r\ncitrate method.\r\n\r\nRoss has also proposed to estimate the acid soluble in ammonium citrate\r\ndirectly by first destroying the organic matter by moist combustion\r\nwith sulfuric acid.[121] He recommends the following process:\r\n\r\nAfter completion of the thirty minutes’ digestion of the sample with\r\ncitrate solution, twenty-five cubic centimeters are filtered at once\r\ninto a dry vessel. If the liquid be filtered directly into a dry\r\nburette, twenty-five cubic centimeters can be readily transferred\r\nto another vessel without dilution. After cooling, run twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution into a digestion flask of 250-300\r\ncubic centimeters capacity, add about fifteen cubic centimeters of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid and place the flask on a piece of wire gauze\r\nover a moderately brisk flame; in about eight minutes the contents of\r\nthe flask commence to darken and foaming begins, but this will occasion\r\nno trouble, if an extremely high, or a very low flame be avoided. In\r\nabout twelve minutes the foaming ceases and the liquid in the flask\r\nappears quite black; about one grain of mercuric oxid is now added\r\nand the digestion is continued over a brisk flame. The operation can\r\nbe completed in less than half an hour with ease, and in many cases,\r\ntwenty-five minutes. After cooling, the contents of the flask are\r\nwashed into a beaker, ammonia is added in slight excess, the solution\r\nis acidified with nitric, and after the addition of fifteen grams of\r\nammonium nitrate, the process is conducted as usual.\r\n\r\nIn case as large an aliquot as fifty cubic centimeters of the original\r\nfiltrate be used, ten cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid are added,\r\nand the digestion is conducted in a flask of 300-500 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity; after the liquid has blackened and foaming has progressed to\r\na considerable extent, the flask is removed from the flame, fifteen\r\ncubic centimeters more of sulfuric acid are added, and the flask and\r\ncontents are heated at a moderate temperature for two or three minutes;\r\nthe mercuric oxid is then added and the operation completed as before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFollowing are some of the advantages offered by the method described:\r\n\r\n(1) It dispenses with the necessity of the execution of the frequently\r\ntedious operation of bringing upon the filter and washing the residue\r\nfrom the ammonium citrate digestion, while the ignition of this residue\r\ntogether with the subsequent digestion with acid and filtration are\r\nalso avoided.\r\n\r\n(2) It affords a means for the direct estimation of that form of\r\nphosphoric acid which, together with the water-soluble, constitutes the\r\navailable phosphoric acid, thus enabling the latter to be determined by\r\nmaking only two estimations.\r\n\r\n(3) In connection with the advantages above mentioned it permits\r\nof a considerable saving of time, as well as of labor required in\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the tests with mercuric oxid, both potassium nitrate and\r\npotassium sulfate were used in the digestion to facilitate oxidation.\r\nWith the former, several additions of the salt were necessary to secure\r\na satisfactory digestion, and even then the time required was longer\r\nthan with the mercury or mercuric oxid digestion. With potassium\r\nsulfate, the excessive foaming which took place interfered greatly with\r\nthe execution of the digestion process.\r\n\r\n=134. Availability of Phosphatic Fertilizers.=—There is perhaps no one\r\nquestion more frequently put to analysts by practical farmers than\r\nthe one relating to the availability of fertilizing materials. The\r\nobject of the manufacturer should be to secure each of the valuable\r\ningredients of his goods in the most useful form. The ideal form in\r\nwhich phosphoric acid should come to the soil is one soluble in water.\r\nEven in localities where heavy rains may abound, there is not much\r\ndanger of loss of soluble acid by percolation. As has before been\r\nindicated, the soluble acid tends to become fixed in all normal soils,\r\nand to remain in a state accessible to the rootlets of plants, and yet\r\nfree from danger of leaching. For this reason, by most agronomists, the\r\nwater-soluble acid is not regarded as more available than that portion\r\ninsoluble in water, yet soluble in ammonium citrate.\r\n\r\nIn many of the States the statutes, or custom, prescribe that only the\r\nwater and citrate-soluble acid shall be reckoned as available, the\r\ninsoluble residue being allowed no place in the estimates of value.\r\nIn many instances such a custom may lead to considerable error, as\r\nin the case of finely ground bones and some forms of soft and easily\r\ndecomposable tricalcium phosphates. There are also, on the markets,\r\nphosphates composed largely of iron and aluminum salts, and these\r\nappear to have an available value often in excess of the quantities\r\nthereof soluble in ammonium citrate.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the apatites, when reduced to a fine powder and applied to\r\nthe soil, are the least available of the natural phosphates. Next in\r\norder come the land rock and pebble phosphates which, in most soils,\r\nhave only a limited availability. The soft fine-ground phosphates,\r\nespecially in soils rich in humus, have an agricultural value,\r\nalmost, if not quite equal to a similar amount of acid in the acid\r\nphosphates. Fine-ground bones also tend to give up their phosphoric\r\nacid with a considerable degree of readiness in most soils. Natural\r\niron and aluminum phosphates, have also, as a rule, a high degree of\r\navailability. In each case the analyst must consider all the factors of\r\nthe case before rendering a decision. Not only the relative solubility\r\nof the different components of the offered fertilizer in different\r\nmenstrua must be taken into consideration, but also the character of\r\nthe soil to which it is to be applied, the time of application, and the\r\ncrop to be grown. By a diligent study of these conditions the analyst\r\nmay, in the end, reach an accurate judgment of the merits of the sample.\r\n\r\n=135. Direct Weighing of the Molybdenum Precipitate.=—It has already\r\nbeen stated that many attempts have, been made to determine the\r\nphosphoric acid by direct weighing as well as by titration, as in\r\nthe Pemberton method. The point of prime importance in such a direct\r\ndetermination is to secure an ammonium phosphomolybdate mixture of\r\nconstant composition. Unless this can be done no direct method, either\r\nvolumetric or gravimetric, can give reliable results. Hanamann[122]\r\nproposes to secure this constant composition by varying somewhat the\r\ncomposition of the molybdate mixture and precipitating the phosphoric\r\nacid under definite conditions. The molybdate solution employed is\r\nprepared as follows:\r\n\r\n    Molybdic acid                         100 grams.\r\n    Ten per cent ammonia                  1.0 liter.\r\n    Nitric acid (1.246 sp. gr.)           1.5 liters.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation of the phosphoric acid is conducted in the cold\r\nwith constant stirring. It is complete in half an hour. The ammonium\r\nphosphomolybdate is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate and then\r\nwith dilute nitric acid, dried, and ignited at less than a red heat. It\r\nshould then have a bluish-black color throughout. Such a body contains\r\n4.018 per cent of phosphoric anhydrid.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five cubic centimeters of a sodium phosphate solution\r\ncontaining fifty milligrams of phosphoric acid, treated as above, gave\r\na bluish-black precipitate weighing 1.249 grams, which, multiplied\r\nby 0.041018, equaled 50.018 milligrams of phosphorus pentoxid. The\r\nmethod should be tried on phosphates of various kinds and contents of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid before a definite judgment of its merits is formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF THE MANUFACTURE OF SUPERPHOSPHATES.\r\n\r\n=136. Reactions with Phosphates.=—In this country the expressions\r\n“acid” and “super” phosphates are used interchangeably. A more correct\r\nuse of the terms would designate by “acid” the phosphate formed\r\ndirectly from tricalcium phosphate by the action of sulfuric acid,\r\nwhile by “super” would be indicated a similar product formed by the\r\naction of free phosphoric acid on the same materials. In Germany the\r\nlatter compound is called double phosphate.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which takes place in the first instance is represented by\r\nthe following formula:\r\n\r\n      3Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 6H₂SO₄ + 12H₂O = 4H₃PO₄ + Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 6(CaSO₄·2H₂O);\r\n\r\n    and 4H₃PO₄ + Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 3H₂O = 3[CaH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O].\r\n\r\nA simpler form of the reaction is expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 2H₂SO₄ + 5H₂O  = CaH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O + 2[CaSO₄·2H₂O].\r\n\r\nIf 310 parts, by weight, of fine-ground tricalcium phosphate be mixed\r\nwith 196 parts of sulfuric acid and ninety parts of water, and the\r\nresulting jelly be quickly diluted with a large quantity of water, and\r\nfiltered, there will be found in the filtrate about three-quarters of\r\nthe total phosphoric as free acid. If, however, the jelly, at first,\r\nformed as above, be left to become dry and hard, the filtrate, when the\r\nmass is beaten up with water and filtered, will contain monocalcium\r\nphosphate, CaH₄(PO₄)₂.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of sulfuric acid used be not sufficient for complete\r\ndecomposition, the dicalcium salt is formed directly according to the\r\nfollowing reaction:\r\n\r\n    Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + H₂SO₄ + 6H₂O = Ca₂H₂(PO₄)₂·4H₂O + CaSO₄·2H₂O.\r\n\r\nThis arises, doubtless, by the formation, at first, of the regular\r\nmonocalcium salt and the further reaction of this with the tricalcium\r\ncompound, as follows:\r\n\r\n    CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + H₂O + Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 7H₂O = 2[Ca₂H₂(PO₄)₂·4H₂O].\r\n\r\nThis reaction represents, theoretically, the so-called reversion of\r\nthe phosphoric acid. When there is an excess of sulfuric acid there is\r\na complete decomposition of the calcium salts with the production of\r\nfree phosphoric acid and gypsum. The reaction is represented by the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n    Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 3H₂SO₄ + 6H₂O = 2H₃PO₄ + 3[CaSO₄·2H₂O].\r\n\r\nThe crystallized gypsum absorbs the six molecules of water in its\r\nmolecular structure.\r\n\r\n=137. Reactions with Fluorids.=—Since calcium fluorid is present in\r\nnearly all mineral phosphates, the reactions of this compound must be\r\ntaken into consideration in a chemical study of the manufacture of acid\r\nphosphates. When treated with sulfuric acid the first reaction which\r\ntakes place consists in the formation of hydrofluoric acid: CaF₂ +\r\nH₂SO₄ = 2HF + CaSO₄. Since, however, there is generally some silica in\r\nreach of the nascent acid, all, or a portion of it, combines at once\r\nwith this silica, forming silicon tetrafluorid: 4HF + SiO₂ = 2H₂O +\r\nSiF₄. This compound, however, is decomposed at once in the presence of\r\nwater, forming hydrofluosilicic acid: 3SiF₄ + 2H₂O = SiO₂ + 2H₂SiF₆.\r\nThe presence of calcium fluorid in natural phosphates is extremely\r\nobjectionable from a technical point of view, both on account of the\r\nincreased consumption of oil of vitriol which it causes, but also by\r\nreason of the injurious nature of gaseous fluorin compounds produced.\r\nEach 100 pounds of calcium fluorid entails the consumption of 125.6\r\npounds of sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n=138. Reaction with Carbonates.=—Most mineral phosphates contain\r\ncalcium carbonate in varying quantities. This compound is decomposed on\r\ntreatment with sulfuric acid according to the reaction: CaCO₃ + H₂SO₄ =\r\nCaSO₄ + H₂O + CO₂. When present in moderate amounts, calcium carbonate\r\nis not an objectionable impurity in natural phosphates intended for\r\nacid phosphate manufacture. The reaction with sulfuric acid which takes\r\nplace produces a proper rise in temperature throughout the mass, while\r\nthe escaping carbon dioxid permeates and lightens the whole mass,\r\nassisting thus in completing the chemical reaction by leaving the\r\nresidual mass porous, and capable of being easily dried and pulverized.\r\nWhere large quantities of carbonate in proportion to the phosphate\r\nare present the sulfuric acid used should be dilute enough to furnish\r\nthe necessary water of crystallization to the gypsum formed. For each\r\n100 parts, by weight, of calcium carbonate, eighty parts of sulfuric\r\nanhydrid are necessary, or 125 parts of acid of 1.710 specific gravity\r\n= 60° Beaumé.\r\n\r\nIn some guanos a part of the calcium is found as pyrophosphate, and\r\nthis is acted upon by the sulfuric acid in the following way: Ca₂P₂O₇ +\r\nH₂SO₄ = CaH₂P₂O₇ + CaSO₄.\r\n\r\n=139. Solution of the Iron and Alumina Compounds.=—Iron may occur in\r\nnatural phosphates in many forms. It probably is most frequently met\r\nwith as ferric or ferrous phosphate, seldom as ferric oxid, and often\r\nas pyrite, FeS₂. The iron also may sometimes exist as a silicate. The\r\nalumina is found chiefly in combination with phosphoric acid, and as\r\nsilicate.\r\n\r\nWhere a little less sulfuric acid is employed, as is generally the\r\ncase, than is necessary for complete solution, the iron phosphate is\r\nattacked as represented below:\r\n\r\n    3FePO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ = FePO₄·2H₂PO₄ + Fe₂(SO₄)₃.\r\n\r\nWhen an excess of sulfuric acid is employed, the formula is reduced to\r\nthe simple one:\r\n\r\n    2FePO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ = 2H₃PO₄ + Fe₂(SO₄)₃.\r\n\r\nA part of the iron sulfate formed reacts with the acid calcium\r\nphosphate present to produce a permanent jelly-like compound, difficult\r\nto dry and handle. As much as two per cent of iron phosphate, however,\r\nmay be present without serious interference with the commercial\r\nhandling of the product. By using more sulfuric acid as much as four\r\nor five per cent of the iron phosphate can be held in solution. Larger\r\nquantities are very troublesome from a commercial point of view. The\r\nreaction of the ferric sulfate with monocalcium phosphate, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    3CaH(PO₄)₂ + Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 4H₂O = 2(FePO₄·2H₃PO₄·2H₂O) + 3CaSO₄.\r\n\r\nPyrite and the silicates containing iron are not attacked by sulfuric\r\nacid, and these compounds are therefore left, in the final product, in\r\na harmless state. If the pyritic iron is to be brought into solution\r\naqua regia should be employed.\r\n\r\nWith sufficient acid the aluminum phosphate is decomposed with the\r\nformation of aluminum sulfate and free phosphoric acid:\r\n\r\n    AlPO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ = Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 2H₃PO₄.\r\n\r\n=140. Reaction with Magnesium Compounds.=—The mineral phosphates, as a\r\nrule, contain but little magnesia. When present it is probably as an\r\nacid salt, MgHPO₄. Its decomposition takes place in slight deficiency\r\nor excess of sulfuric acid respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n    2MgHP₄ + H₂SO₄ + 2H₂O = [MgH₄(PO₄)₂·2H₂O] + MgSO₄\r\n\r\n    and    MgHPO₄ + H₂SO₄ = H₃PO₄ + MgSO₄.\r\n\r\nThe magnesia, when in the form of oxid, is capable of producing a\r\nreversion of the monocalcium phosphate, as is shown below:\r\n\r\n    CaH₄(PO₄)₂ + MgO = CaMgH₂(PO₄)₂ + H₂O.\r\n\r\nOne part by weight of magnesia can render three and one-half parts of\r\nsoluble monocalcium phosphate insoluble.\r\n\r\n=141. Determination of Quantity of Sulfuric Acid Necessary for Solution\r\nof a Mineral Phosphate.=—The theoretical quantity of sulfuric acid\r\nrequired for the proper treatment of any phosphate may be calculated\r\nfrom its chemical analysis and by the formulas and reactions already\r\ngiven. For the experimental determination the method of Rümpler may be\r\nfollowed.[123]\r\n\r\nTwenty grams of the fine phosphate are placed in a liter flask with a\r\ngreater quantity of accurately measured sulfuric acid than is necessary\r\nfor complete solution. The acid should have a specific gravity of 1.455\r\nor 45° B. The mixture is allowed to stand for two hours at 50°. It is\r\nthen cooled, the flask filled with water to the mark, well shaken, and\r\nthe contents filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate are\r\ntreated with tenth normal soda-lye until basic phosphate begins to\r\nseparate. The excess of acid used is then calculated. Example: Twenty\r\ngrams of phosphate containing 28.3 per cent of phosphoric acid, 10.0\r\nper cent of calcium carbonate, 5.5 per cent of calcium fluorid, and\r\n2.4 per cent of calcium chlorid were treated as above with sixteen\r\ncubic centimeters of sulfuric acid containing 10.24 grams of sulfur\r\ntrioxid. In titrating fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate obtained\r\nas described above, 10.4 cubic centimeters of tenth normal soda-lye\r\nwere used, equivalent to 0.0416 gram of sulfur trioxid. Then 10.24 × 50\r\n÷ 1000 = 0.5120 = total sulfur trioxid in fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe filtrate, and 0.5120 - 0.0416 = 0.4704 gram, the amount of sulfur\r\ntrioxid consumed in the decomposition.\r\n\r\nTherefore the sulfur trioxid required for decomposition is 47.04 per\r\ncent of the weight of the phosphate employed. One hundred parts of the\r\nphosphate would therefore require 47.04 parts of sulfur trioxid = to\r\n73.6 parts of sulfuric acid of 1.710 specific gravity or 92.1 parts of\r\n1.530 specific gravity.\r\n\r\nA more convenient method than the one mentioned above consists in\r\ntreating a small quantity of the phosphate, from one-half to one\r\nkilogram, in the laboratory, or fifty kilograms in a lead box, just\r\nas would be practiced on a large scale. A few tests with these small\r\nquantities, followed by drying and grinding will reveal to the skilled\r\noperator the approximate quantity and strength of sulfuric acid to\r\nbe used in each case. The quantities of sulfuric acid as determined\r\nby calculation from analyses and by actual laboratory tests agree\r\nfairly well in most instances. There is, however, sometimes a marked\r\ndisagreement. The general rule of practice is to use always an amount\r\nof sulfuric acid sufficient to produce and maintain water-soluble\r\nphosphoric acid in the fertilizer, but the sulfuric acid must not be\r\nused in such quantity as to interfere with the subsequent drying,\r\ngrinding, and marketing of the acid phosphate.\r\n\r\nFor convenience the following table may be used for calculating the\r\nquantity of oil of vitriol needed for each unit of weight of material\r\nnoted:\r\n\r\nONE PART BY WEIGHT OF EACH SUBSTANCE BELOW REQUIRES:\r\n\r\n                    SULFURIC ACID BY SAME UNIT OF WEIGHT.\r\n\r\n                          At 48°   At 50°  At 52°  At 54°  At 55°\r\n                             B.

Phosphoric Acid Superphosphates.=—If a mineral phosphate be\r\ndecomposed by free phosphoric in place of sulfuric acid the resulting\r\ncompound will contain about three times as much available phosphoric\r\nacid as is found in the ordinary acid phosphate. The reaction takes\r\nplace according to the following formulas:\r\n\r\n    (1)  Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 4H₃PO₄ + 3H₂O = 3[CAH₄(PO₄)₂·H₂O].\r\n\r\n    (2) Ca₃(PO₄)₃ + 2H₃PO₄ + 12H₂O = 3[Ca₂H₂(PO₄)₂·4H₂O].\r\n\r\nIn each case the water in the final product is probably united as\r\ncrystal water with the calcium salts produced. The monocalcium salt\r\nformed in the first reaction is soluble in water and the dicalcium salt\r\nin the second reaction in ammonium citrate. Where fertilizers are to\r\nbe transported to great distances there is a considerable saving of\r\nfreight by the use of such a high-grade phosphate, which may, at times,\r\ncontain over forty per cent of available acid.

Kinds of Nitrogen in Fertilizers.=—Nitrogen is the most costly\r\nof the essential plant foods. It has been shown in the first volume,\r\nparagraph =23=, that the popular notion regarding the relatively great\r\nabundance of nitrogen is erroneous. It forms only 0.02 per cent of the\r\nmatter forming and pertaining to the earth’s crust. The great mass of\r\nnitrogen forming the bulk of the atmosphere is inert and useless in\r\nrespect of its adaptation to plant food. It is not until it becomes\r\noxidized by combustion, electrical discharges, or the action of certain\r\nmicroorganisms that it assumes an agricultural value.\r\n\r\nHaving already, in the first volume, described the relation of nitrogen\r\nto the soil it remains the sole province of the present part to\r\nstudy it as aggregated in a form suited to plant fertilization. In\r\nthis function nitrogen may claim the attention of the analyst in the\r\nfollowing forms:\r\n\r\n1. In organic combination in animal or vegetable substances, forming a\r\nlarge class of bodies, of which protein may be taken as the type. Dried\r\nblood or cottonseed-meal illustrates this form of combination.\r\n\r\n2. In the form of ammonia or combinations thereof, especially as\r\nammonium sulfate, or as amid nitrogen.\r\n\r\n3. In a more highly oxidized form as nitrous or nitric acid usually\r\nunited with a base of which Chile saltpeter may be taken as a type.\r\n\r\nThe analyst has often to deal with single forms of nitrogenous\r\ncompounds, but in many instances may also find all the typical forms in\r\na single sample. Among the possible cases which may arise the following\r\nare types:\r\n\r\n_a._ The sample under examination may contain nitrogen in all three\r\nforms mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_b._ There may be present nitrogen in the organic form mixed with\r\nnitric nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_c._ Ammoniacal nitrogen may replace the nitric in the above\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n_d._ The sample may contain no organic but only nitric and ammoniacal\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n_e._ Only nitric or ammoniacal nitrogen may be present.\r\n\r\n=144. Determination of the State of Combination.=—Some of the sample\r\nis mixed with a little powdered soda-lime. If ammoniacal nitrogen be\r\npresent free ammonia is evolved even in the cold and may be detected\r\neither by its odor or by testing the escaping gas with litmus or\r\nturmeric paper. A glass rod moistened with strong hydrochloric acid\r\nwill produce white fumes of ammonium chlorid when brought near the\r\nescaping ammonia.\r\n\r\nIf the sample contain any notable amount of nitric acid it will\r\nbe revealed by treating an aqueous solution of it with a crystal\r\nof ferrous sulfate and strong sulfuric acid. The iron salt should\r\nbe placed in a test-tube with a few drops of the solution of the\r\nfertilizer and the sulfuric acid poured down the sides of the tube in\r\nsuch a way as not to mix with the other liquids. The tube must be kept\r\ncold. A dark brown ring will mark the disk of separation between the\r\nsulfuric acid and the aqueous solution in case nitric acid be present.\r\nIf water produce a solution of the sample too highly colored to be used\r\nas above, alcohol of eighty per cent strength may be substituted. The\r\ncoloration produced in this case is of a rose or purple tint.\r\n\r\nNitric nitrogen may also be detected by means of brucin. If a few drops\r\nof an aqueous solution of brucin be mixed with the same quantity of an\r\naqueous extract of the sample under examination and strong sulfuric\r\nacid be added, as described above, there will be developed at the disk\r\nof contact between the acid and the mixed solutions a persistent rose\r\ntint varying to yellow.\r\n\r\nTo detect the presence of organic albuminoid nitrogen the residue\r\ninsoluble in water, when heated with soda-lime, will give rise to\r\nammonia which may be detected as described above.\r\n\r\n=145. Microscopic Examination.=—If the chemical test reveal the\r\npresence of organic nitrogen the next point to be determined is the\r\nnature of the substance containing it. Often this is revealed by simple\r\ninspection, as in the case of cottonseed-meal. Frequently, however,\r\nespecially in cases of fine-ground mixed goods, the microscope must\r\nbe employed to determine the character of the organic matter. It is\r\nimportant to know whether hair, horn, hoof, and other less valuable\r\nforms of nitrogenous compounds have been substituted for dried blood,\r\ntankage, and more valuable forms. In most cases the qualitative\r\nchemical, and microscopic examination will be sufficient. There may be\r\ncases, however, where the analyst will be under the necessity of using\r\nother means of identification suggested by his skill and experience or\r\nthe circumstances connected with any particular instance. In such cases\r\nthe general appearance, odor, and consistence of the sample may afford\r\nvaluable indications which will aid in discovering the origin of the\r\nnitrogenous materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n=146. Seeds and Seed Residues.=—The proteid matters in seeds and seed\r\nresidues, after the extraction of the oil, are highly prized as sources\r\nof nitrogenous fertilizers either for direct application or for mixing.\r\nTypical of this class of substances is cottonseed-meal, the residue\r\nleft after the extraction of the oil which is accomplished at the\r\npresent time mostly by hydraulic pressure. The residual cakes contain\r\nstill some oil but nearly half their weight consists of nitrogenous\r\ncompounds. The following table gives the composition of a sample of\r\ncottonseed-meal:\r\n\r\n    Ash                               7.60 per cent.\r\n    Fiber                             4.90    “\r\n    Oil                              10.01    “\r\n    Protein                          51.12    “\r\n    Digestible carbohydrates, etc.   26.37    “\r\n\r\nWhile the above shows the composition of a single sample of the meal\r\nit should be remembered that there may be wide variations from this\r\nstandard due either to natural composition or to different degrees of\r\nthe extraction of the oil.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the ash is given below:\r\n\r\n    Phosphoric acid, P₂O₅            31.01 per cent.\r\n    Potash,          K₂O             35.50    “\r\n    Soda,            Na₂O              0.57   “\r\n    Lime,            CaO               5.68   “\r\n    Magnesia,        MgO              15.19   “\r\n    Sulfuric acid,   SO₃               3.90   “\r\n    Insoluble,                         0.69   “\r\n    Carbon dioxid and undetermined,    7.46   “\r\n\r\nThe cakes left after the expression of the oil from flaxseed and\r\nother oily seeds are also very rich in nitrogenous matters; but these\r\nresidues are chiefly used for cattle-feeding and only the undigested\r\nportions of them pass into the manure. Cottonseed cake-meal is not so\r\nwell suited for cattle-feeding as the others mentioned, because of the\r\ncholin and betaïn which it contains; often in sufficient quantities\r\nto render its use dangerous to young animals. The danger in feeding\r\nincreases as the total quantity of the two bases and also as the\r\nrelative quantity of cholin to betaïn, the former base being more\r\npoisonous than the latter. In a sample of the mixed bases prepared in\r\nthis laboratory from cottonseed cake-meal the cholin amounted to 17.5\r\nand the betaïn to 82.5 per cent of the whole.[125]\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen contained in these bases is also included in the total\r\nnitrogen found in the meal. The actual proteid value of the numbers\r\nobtained for nitrogen is therefore less than that obtained for the\r\nwhole of the nitrogen by the quantity present as nitrogenous bases.\r\n\r\nIn the United States cottonseed cake-meal is used in large quantities\r\nas a direct fertilizer but not so extensively for mixing as some of\r\nthe other sources of nitrogen. Its delicate yellow color serves to\r\ndistinguish it at once from the other bodies used for similar purposes.\r\nNo special mention need be made of other oil-cake residues. They are\r\nquite similar in their composition and uses, and manner of treatment\r\nand analysis to the cottonseed product.\r\n\r\n=147. Fish Scrap.=—Certain species of fish, such as the menhaden, are\r\nvalued more highly for their oil and refuse than for food purposes.\r\nBut even where fish in large quantities are prepared for human food,\r\nthere is a considerable quantity of waste matter which is valuable for\r\nfertilizing purposes. The residue of fish from which the fat and oil\r\nhave been extracted, is dried and ground for fertilizing uses. The fish\r\nscrap thus obtained is used extensively, especially on the Atlantic\r\nborder of the United States, for furnishing the nitrogenous ingredient\r\nin mixed fertilizers, and also for direct application to the fields. In\r\nfish flesh deprived of oil and water, the content of phosphoric acid is\r\nabout two and one-half per cent, while the proteid matter may amount to\r\nthree-quarters of the whole.[126]\r\n\r\nThe use of fish for fertilizing purposes is not new. As early as 1621\r\nthe settlers at Plymouth were taught to fertilize their maize fields by\r\nSquanto, an Indian. According to Goode, the value of nitrogen derived\r\nfrom the menhaden alone was two million dollars in 1875.[127] In 1878\r\nit is estimated that 200,000 tons of these fish were captured between\r\nCape Henry and the Bay of Fundy. The use of fish scrap for nitrogenous\r\nfertilizing has, since then, become an established industry, and the\r\nanalyst may well examine his samples for this source of nitrogen when\r\nthey are manufactured at points on the Atlantic coast, in proximity to\r\ngreat fishing centers.\r\n\r\n=148. Dried Blood and Tankage.=—The blood and débris from abattoirs\r\nafford abundant sources of nitrogen in a form easily oxidized by the\r\nmicroorganisms of the soil. Blood is prepared for use by simple drying\r\nand grinding. The intestines, scraps, and fragments of flesh resulting\r\nfrom trimming and cutting, are placed in tanks and steamed under\r\npressure to remove the fat. The residue is dried and ground, forming\r\nthe tankage of commerce. Dried blood is richer in proteid matter than\r\nany other substance in common use for fertilizing purposes. When in a\r\nperfectly dry state, it may contain as much as fourteen per cent of\r\nnitrogen, equivalent to nearly eighty-eight per cent of proteid or\r\nalbuminoid matter. Tankage is less rich in nitrogen than dried blood,\r\nbut still contains enough to make it a highly desirable constituent of\r\nmanures. Naturally, it would vary more in its nitrogen content than\r\ndried blood.\r\n\r\n=149. Horn, Hoof, and Hair.=—These bodies, although quite rich in\r\nnitrogen, are not well suited to fertilizing purposes on account\r\nof the extreme slowness of their decomposition. Their presence,\r\ntherefore, should be regarded in the nature of a fraud, because by the\r\nusual methods of analysis they show a high percentage of nitrogen,\r\nand therefore acquire a fictitious value. The relative value of the\r\nnitrogen in these bodies as compared with the more desirable forms, is\r\ngiven in paragraph =5=.\r\n\r\n=150. Ammoniacal Nitrogen.=—In ammonia compounds, nitrogen is used\r\nchiefly for fertilizing purposes as sulfate. The ideal nitrogenous\r\nfertilizer would be a combination of the ammoniacal and nitric nitrogen\r\nfound in ammonium nitrate. The high cost of this substance excludes its\r\nuse except for experimental purposes.\r\n\r\n=151. Nitrogen in Guanos.=—The nitrogen in guanos may be found partly\r\nas organic, partly as ammoniacal, and partly as nitric nitrogen. The\r\nhigh manurial value of guanos and bat deposits in caves, is due not\r\nonly to their phosphoric acid, but also to the fact that part of the\r\nnitrogen is immediately available, while a part becomes assimilable\r\nby nitrification during the growing season. The content of nitrogen\r\nin guanos is extremely variable, and depends largely on the climatic\r\nconditions to which the deposit has been subjected. The state in which\r\nit exists is also a variable one, but with a constant tendency to\r\nassume finally the nitric condition.\r\n\r\nThe well-known habits of birds in congregating in rookeries during\r\nthe nights, and at certain seasons of the year, tend to bring into a\r\ncommon receptacle the nitrogenous matters which they have gathered\r\nand which are deposited in their excrement and in the decay of their\r\nbodies. The feathers of birds are particularly rich in nitrogen, and\r\nthe nitrogenous content of the flesh of fowls is also high. The decay\r\ntherefore, of remains of birds, especially if it take place largely\r\nexcluded from the leaching of water, tends to accumulate vast deposits\r\nof nitrogenous matter. If the conditions in such deposits be favorable\r\nto the processes of nitrification, the whole of the nitrogen, or at\r\nleast the larger part of it, which has been collected in this débris,\r\nbecomes finally converted into nitric acid, and is found combined\r\nwith appropriate bases as deposits of nitrates. The nitrates of the\r\nguano deposits, and of the deposits in caves, arise in this way. If\r\nthese deposits be subject to moderate leaching, the nitrate may become\r\ninfiltered into the surrounding soil, making it very rich in this form\r\nof nitrogen. The beds and surrounding soils of caves are often found\r\nhighly impregnated with nitrates.\r\n\r\nWhile for our purpose, deposits of nitrates only are to be considered\r\nwhich are of sufficient value to bear transportation, yet much interest\r\nattaches to the formation of nitrates in the soil even when they are\r\nnot of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nIn many soils of tropical regions not subject to heavy rainfalls, the\r\naccumulation of these nitrates is very great. Müntz and Marcano[128]\r\nhave investigated many of these soils, to which attention was called\r\nfirst by Humboldt and Boussingault. They state that these soils are\r\nincomparably more rich in nitrates than the most fertile soils of\r\nEurope. The samples which they examined were collected from different\r\nparts of Venezuela and from the valleys of the Orinoco, as well as on\r\nthe shore of the Sea of Antilles. The nitrated soils are very abundant\r\nin this region of South America, where they cover large surfaces. Their\r\ncomposition is variable, but in all of them calcium carbonate and\r\nphosphate are met with, and organic nitrogenous material. The nitric\r\nacid is found always combined with lime. In some of the soils as high\r\nas thirty per cent of calcium nitrate have been found. Nitrification\r\nof organic material takes place very rapidly the year round in this\r\ntropical region. These nitrated soils are everywhere abundant around\r\ncaves, as described by Humboldt, which serve as the refuge of birds and\r\nbats. The nitrogenous matters, which come from the decay of the remains\r\nof these animals, form true deposits of guano, which are gradually\r\nspread around, and which, in contact with the limestone and with access\r\nof air, suffer complete nitrification with the fixation of the nitric\r\nacid by the lime.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of this guano are also due to the débris of insects,\r\nfragments of elytra, scales of the wings of butterflies, etc., which\r\nare brought together in those places by the millions of cubic meters.\r\nThe nitrification, which takes place in these deposits, has been found\r\nto extend its products to a distance of several kilometers through the\r\nsoil. In some places the quantity of calcium nitrate is so great in the\r\nsoils that they are converted into a plastic paste by this deliquescent\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n=152. Nitric Nitrogen.=—In its purer forms, and suited to manurial\r\npurposes, nitric acid exists in combination with sodium as a compound\r\ncommonly known as Chile saltpeter.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these nitrate deposits has long been known.[129] The\r\nold Indian laws originally prohibited the collection of the salt, but\r\nnevertheless it was secretly collected and sold. Up to the year 1821,\r\nsoda saltpeter was not known in Europe except as a laboratory product.\r\nAbout this time the naturalist, Mariano de Rivero, found on the Pacific\r\ncoast, in the Province of Tarapacà, immense new deposits of the salt.\r\nLater the salt was found in equal abundance in the Territory of\r\nAntofagasta, and further to the south in the desert of Atacama, which\r\nforms the Department of Taltal.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the collection and export of saltpeter from Chile\r\nis a business of great importance. The largest export which has ever\r\ntaken place in one year was in 1890, when the amount exported was\r\n927,290,430 kilograms; of this quantity 642,506,985 kilograms were\r\nsent to England and 86,124,870 kilograms to the United States. Since\r\nthat time the imports of this salt into the United States have largely\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pissis[130] these deposits are of very ancient origin.\r\nThis geologist is of the opinion that the nitrate deposits are the\r\nresult of the decomposition of feldspathic rocks, the bases thus\r\nproduced gradually becoming united with the nitric acid provided from\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of Nöllner[131] the deposits are of more modern\r\norigin, and due to the decomposition of marine vegetation. Continuous\r\nsolution of soils beneath the sea gives rise to the formation of great\r\nlakes of saturated water, in which occurs the development of much\r\nmarine vegetation. On the evaporation of this water, due to geologic\r\nisolation, the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter causes\r\ngeneration of nitric acid, which, coming in contact with the calcareous\r\nrocks, attacks them, forming calcium nitrate, which, in presence of\r\nsodium sulfate, gives rise to a double decomposition into sodium\r\nnitrate and calcium sulfate.\r\n\r\nThe fact that iodin is found in greater or less quantity in Chile\r\nsaltpeter is one of the chief supports of this hypothesis of marine\r\norigin, inasmuch as iodin is always found in sea plants, and not\r\nin terrestrial plants. Further than this, it must be taken into\r\nconsideration that these deposits of sodium nitrate contain neither\r\nshells nor fossils, nor do they contain any calcium phosphate. The\r\ntheory, therefore, that they are due to animal origin is scarcely\r\ntenable.\r\n\r\nLately extensive nitrate deposits have been discovered in the U.\r\nS. of Columbia.[132] These deposits have been found extending over\r\nthirty square miles and vary in thickness from one to ten feet. The\r\nvisible supply is estimated at 7,372,800,000 tons, containing from\r\n1.0 to 13.5 percent of nitrate. The deposits consist of a mixture of\r\nsodium nitrate, sodium chlorid, calcium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, and\r\ninsoluble silica. It is thought that the amount of these deposits will\r\nalmost equal those in Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n=153. Classification of Methods.=—In general there are three direct\r\nmethods of determining the nitrogen content of fertilizers. First the\r\nnitrogen may be secured in a gaseous form and the volume thereof, under\r\nstandard conditions, measured and the weight of nitrogen computed. This\r\nprocess is commonly known as the absolute method. Practically it has\r\npassed out of use in fertilizer work, or is practiced only as a check\r\nagainst new and untried methods, or on certain nitrogenous compounds\r\nwhich do not readily yield all their nitrogen by the other methods.\r\nThe process, first perfected by Dumas, who has also given it his name,\r\nconsists in the combustion of the nitrogenous body in an environment\r\nof copper oxid by which the nitrogen, by reason of its inertness, is\r\nleft in a gaseous state after the oxidation of the other constituents;\r\n_viz._, carbon and hydrogen, originally present.\r\n\r\nIn the second class of methods the nitrogen is converted into ammonia\r\nwhich is absorbed by an excess of standard acid, the residue of which\r\nis determined by subsequent titration with a standard alkali. There are\r\ntwo distinct processes belonging to this class, in one of which ammonia\r\nis directly produced by dry combustion of an organic nitrogenous\r\ncompound with an alkali, and in the other ammonium sulfate is produced\r\nby moist combustion with sulfuric acid, and the salt thus formed is\r\nsubsequently distilled with an alkali, and the free ammonia thus formed\r\nestimated as above described. Nitric nitrogen may also be reduced to\r\nammonia by nascent hydrogen either in an acid or alkaline solution as\r\ndescribed in volume first.\r\n\r\nIn the third class of determinations is included the estimation of\r\nnitric nitrogen by colorimetric methods as described in the first\r\nvolume. These processes have little practical value in connection with\r\nthe analyses of commercial fertilizers, but find their chief use in the\r\ndetection and estimation of extremely minute quantities of nitrites\r\nand nitrates. In the following paragraphs will be given the standard\r\nmethods for the determination of nitrogen in practical work with\r\nfertilizing materials and fertilizers.\r\n\r\n=154. Official Methods.=—The methods adopted by the Association of\r\nOfficial Agricultural Chemists have been developed by more than ten\r\nyears of co-operative work on the part of the leading agricultural\r\nchemists of the United States. These methods should be strictly\r\nfollowed in all essential points by all analysts in cases where\r\ncomparison with other data are concerned. Future experience will\r\ndoubtless improve the processes both in respect of accuracy and\r\nsimplicity, but it must be granted that, as at present practiced, they\r\ngive essentially accurate results.\r\n\r\n=155. Volumetric Estimation by Combustion with Copper Oxid.=—This\r\nclassical method of analysis is based on the supposition that by the\r\ncombustion of a substance containing nitrogen in copper oxid and\r\nconducting the products of the oxidation over red-hot copper oxid and\r\nmetallic copper, all of the nitrogen present in whatever form will be\r\nobtained in a free state and can subsequently be measured as a gas.\r\nThe air originally present in all parts of the apparatus must first\r\nbe removed either by a mercury pump or by carbon dioxid or by both\r\ntogether, the residual carbon dioxid being absorbed by a solution of\r\ncaustic alkali. Great delicacy of manipulation is necessary to secure\r\na perfect vacuum and as a rule a small quantity of gas may be measured\r\nother than nitrogen so that the results of the analyses are often\r\na trifle too high. The presence of another element associated with\r\nnitrogen, or the possible allotropic existence of that element, may\r\nalso prove to be a disturbing factor in this long-practiced analytical\r\nprocess. For instance, if nitrogen be contaminated with another\r\nelement, _e. g._, argon, of a greater density the commonly accepted\r\nweight of a liter of nitrogen is too great and tables of calculation\r\nbased on that weight would give results too high.\r\n\r\nFirst will be given the official method for this process, followed by a\r\nfew simple variations thereof, as practiced in this laboratory.\r\n\r\n=156. The Official Volumetric Method.=—This process may be used for\r\nnitrogen in any form of combination.[133]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus and reagents needed are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Combustion tube_ of best hard Bohemian glass, about sixty-six\r\ncentimeters long and 12.7 millimeters internal diameter.\r\n\r\n_Azotometer_ of at least 100 cubic centimeters capacity, accurately\r\ncalibrated.\r\n\r\n_Sprengel mercury air-pump._\r\n\r\n_Small paper scoop_, easily made from stiff writing paper.\r\n\r\n_Coarse cupric oxid._—To be ignited and cooled before using.\r\n\r\n_Fine cupric oxid._—Prepared by pounding ordinary cupric oxid in a\r\nmortar.\r\n\r\n_Metallic copper._—Granulated copper, or fine copper gauze, reduced and\r\ncooled in a current of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n_Sodium bicarbonate._—Free from organic matter.\r\n\r\n_Caustic potash solution._—Make a supersaturated solution of caustic\r\npotash in hot water. When absorption of carbon dioxid, during the\r\ncombustion, ceases to be prompt, the solution must be discarded.\r\n\r\n_Filling the tube._—Of ordinary commercial fertilizers take from\r\none to two grams for analysis. In the case of highly nitrogenized\r\nsubstances the amount to be taken must be regulated by the amount of\r\nnitrogen estimated to be present. Fill the tube as follows: (1) About\r\nfive centimeters of coarse cupric oxid: (2) Place on the small paper\r\nscoop enough of the fine cupric oxid to fill, after having been mixed\r\nwith the substance to be analyzed, about ten centimeters of the tube;\r\npour on this the substance, rinsing the watch-glass with a little of\r\nthe fine oxid, and mix thoroughly with a spatula; pour into the tube,\r\nrinsing the scoop with a little fine oxid: (3) About thirty centimeters\r\nof coarse cupric oxid: (4) About seven centimeters of metallic copper:\r\n(5) About six centimeters of coarse cupric oxid (anterior layer):\r\n(6) A small plug of asbestos: (7) From eight-tenths to one gram of\r\nsodium bicarbonate: (8) A large, loose plug of asbestos; place the\r\ntube in the furnace, leaving about two and five-tenths centimeters of\r\nit projecting; connect with the pump by a rubber stopper smeared with\r\nglycerol, taking care to make the connection perfectly tight.\r\n\r\n_Operation._—Exhaust the air from the tube by means of the pump. When a\r\nvacuum has been obtained allow the flow of mercury to continue; light\r\nthe gas under that part of the tube containing the metallic copper,\r\nthe anterior layer of cupric oxid (see (5) above), and the sodium\r\nbicarbonate. As soon as the vacuum is destroyed and the apparatus\r\nfilled with carbon dioxid, shut off the flow of mercury and at once\r\nintroduce the delivery-tube of the pump into the receiving arm of the\r\nazotometer just below the surface of the mercury seal, so that the\r\nescaping bubbles will pass into the air and not into the tube, thus\r\navoiding the useless saturation of the caustic potash solution.\r\n\r\nSet the pump in motion and when the flow of carbon dioxid has very\r\nnearly or completely ceased, pass the delivery-tube down into the\r\nreceiving arm, so that the bubbles will escape into the azotometer.\r\nLight the gas under the thirty centimeter layer of oxid, heat gently\r\nfor a few moments to drive out any moisture that may be present, and\r\nbring to a red heat. Heat gradually the mixture of substance and oxid,\r\nlighting one jet at a time. Avoid a too rapid evolution of bubbles,\r\nwhich should be allowed to escape at the rate of about one per second\r\nor a little faster.\r\n\r\nWhen the jets under the mixture have all been turned on, light the gas\r\nunder the layer of oxid at the end of the tube. When the evolution\r\nof gas has ceased, turn out all the lights except those under the\r\nmetallic copper and anterior layer of oxid, and allow to cool for a\r\nfew moments. Exhaust with the pump and remove the azotometer before\r\nthe flow of mercury is stopped. Break the connection of the tube with\r\nthe pump, stop the flow of mercury, and extinguish the lights. Allow\r\nthe azotometer to stand for at least an hour, or cool with a stream of\r\nwater until a permanent volume and temperature have been reached.\r\n\r\nAdjust accurately the level of the potash solution in the bulb to that\r\nin the azotometer; note the volume of gas, temperature, and height of\r\nbarometer; make calculation as usual, or read results from tables.\r\n\r\n=156. Note on Official Volumetric Method.=—The determination of\r\nnitrogen in its gaseous state by combustion with copper oxid, has\r\npractically gone out of use as an analytical method. The official\r\nchemists rarely use it even for control work on samples sent out for\r\ncomparative analysis. The method recommended differs considerably from\r\nthe process of Jenkins and Johnson, on which it is based. The only\r\nsource of oxygen in the official method is in the copper oxid. Hence it\r\nis necessary that the oxid in immediate contact with the organic matter\r\nbe in a sufficiently fine state of subdivision, and that the substance\r\nitself be very finely powdered and intimately mixed with the oxidizing\r\nmaterial. Failure to attend to these precautions will be followed by\r\nan incomplete combustion and a consequent deficit in the volume of\r\nnitrogen obtained.\r\n\r\nThe copper oxid before using is ignited, and is best filled into the\r\ntube while still warm by means of a long pointed metal scoop, or other\r\nconvenient method. The copper spiral, after use, is reduced at a red\r\nheat in a current of hydrogen, and may thus be used many times.\r\n\r\n=157. The Pump.=—Any form of mercury pump which will secure a complete\r\nvacuum may be used. A most excellent one can be arranged in any\r\nlaboratory at a very small expense. The pump used in this laboratory\r\nfor many years answers every purpose, and costs practically nothing,\r\nbeing made out of old material not very valuable for other use.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the pump and its use in connection with the\r\ncombustion tube will be clearly understood from the following\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.\r\n\r\nMERCURY PUMP AND AZOTOMETER.]\r\n\r\nA glass bulb I is attached, by means of a heavy rubber tube carrying\r\na screw clamp, to the glass tube A, having heavy walls and a small\r\ninternal diameter, and being one meter or more in length. The tube A\r\nis continued in the form of a =U=, the two arms being joined by very\r\nheavy rubber tubing securely wired. The ends of the glass tubes in the\r\nrubber should be bent so that they come near together and form the bend\r\nof the =U=, the rubber simply holding them in place. This is better\r\nthen to have the tube continuous, avoiding danger of breaking. A tee\r\ntube, T, made of the same kind of glass as A, is connected by one arm,\r\na, with the manometer B, by a heavy rubber union well wired. The union\r\nis made perfectly air-tight by the tube filled with mercury held by a\r\nrubber stopper. The middle arm of the tee, a′, is expanded into a bulb,\r\nE, branching into two arms, one of which is connected with A and the\r\nother with the delivery-tube F, by the mercury-rubber unions, MM′, just\r\ndescribed. The interior of the bulb E should be of such a shape as to\r\nallow each drop of mercury to fall at once into F without accumulating\r\nin large quantity and being discharged in mass. The third arm of the\r\ntee a″ is bent upwards at the end and passes into a mercury sealing\r\ntube, D, where it is connected by means of a rubber tube with the\r\ndelivery-tube from the furnace. The flow of the mercury is regulated by\r\nthe clamp C, and care should be taken that the supply does not get so\r\nlow in I as to permit air bubbles to enter A. The manometer B dips into\r\nthe tube of mercury H. A pump thus constructed is simple, flexible,\r\nand perfectly tight. The only part which needs to be specially made is\r\nthe tee and the one in use here was blown in our own laboratory. The\r\nbent end of the delivery-tube F may also be united to the main tube by\r\na rubber joint thus aiding in inserting it into the V-shaped nozzle of\r\nthe azotometer.\r\n\r\nThe azotometer used is the one devised by Schiff and modified by\r\nJohnson and Jenkins.[134]\r\n\r\nWe prefer to get the V nozzles separately and join them to any good\r\nburette by a rubber tube. The water-jacket is not necessary, but the\r\napparatus can be left exposed until it reaches room temperature.\r\n\r\nAny form of mercury pump capable of securing a vacuum may be used,\r\nbut the one just described is commended by simplicity, economy,\r\neffectiveness, and long use.\r\n\r\n=158. The Pump and Combustion Furnace.=—The pump and combustion\r\nfurnace, as used in the laboratory, are shown in Fig. 10. The pump is\r\nconstructed as just described, and rests in a wooden tray which catches\r\nand holds any mercury which may be spilled. The furnace is placed under\r\na hood which carries off the products of the burning lamps and the hot\r\nair. A well-ventilated hood is an important accessory to this process,\r\nespecially when it is carried on in summer. A small mercury pneumatic\r\ntrough catches the overflow from the pump and also serves to immerse\r\nthe end of the delivery-tube during the exhaustion of the combustion\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nThe other details of the arrangement and connections have been\r\nsufficiently shown in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\n=159. Volumetric Method in this Laboratory.=—It has been found\r\nconvenient here to vary slightly the method of the official chemists\r\nin the following respects: The tube used for the combustion is made of\r\nhard refractory glass, which will keep its shape at a high red heat. It\r\nis drawn out and sealed at one end after being well cleaned and dried.\r\nIt should be about eighty centimeters in length and from twelve to\r\nfourteen millimeters in internal diameter. The relative lengths of the\r\nspaces occupied by the several contents of the tube are approximately\r\nas follows: Sodium bicarbonate, two; asbestos, three; coarse copper\r\noxid, eight; fine copper oxid, containing sample, sixteen; coarse\r\ncopper oxid, twenty-five; spiral copper gauze, ten to fifteen; copper\r\noxid, eight; and asbestos plug, five centimeters, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe copper oxid should be heated for a considerable time to redness in\r\na muffle with free access of air before using and the copper gauze be\r\nreduced to pure metallic copper in a current of hydrogen at a low red\r\nheat. The anterior layer of copper oxid serves to oxidize any hydrogen\r\nthat may have been occluded by the copper. When a sample is burned\r\ncontaining all or a considerable part of the nitrogen as nitrates, the\r\nlonger piece of copper gauze is used.\r\n\r\n=160. The Combustion.=—The tube having been charged and connected\r\nwith the pump it is first freed from air by running the pump until\r\nthe mercury no longer rises in the manometer. The end of the tube\r\ncontaining the sodium bicarbonate is then gently heated so that the\r\nevolution of carbon dioxid will be at such a rate as to slowly depress\r\nthe mercury in the manometer, but never fast enough to exceed the\r\ncapacity of the pump to remove it. The lamp is extinguished under the\r\nsodium carbonate and the carbon dioxid completely removed by means of\r\nthe pump. The delivery-tube is then connected with the azotometer, and\r\nthe combustion tube carefully heated from the front end backwards, the\r\ncopper gauze and coarse copper oxid being raised to a red heat before\r\nthe part containing the sample is reached. When the nitrogen begins to\r\ncome off, its flow should be so regulated by means of the lamps under\r\nthe tube, as to be regular and not too rapid. From half an hour to\r\nan hour should be employed in completing the combustion. Since most\r\nsamples of fertilizer contain organic matter, the nitrogen will be\r\nmixed with aqueous vapor and carbon dioxid. The former is condensed\r\nbefore reaching the azotometer, and the latter is absorbed by the\r\npotassium hydroxid. When the sample is wholly of a mineral nature it\r\nshould be mixed with some pure sugar, about half a gram, before being\r\nplaced in the tube. When bubbles of gas no longer come over, the heat\r\nshould be carried back until there is a gradual evolution of carbon\r\ndioxid under the conditions above noted. Finally the gas is turned\r\noff and the pump kept in operation until the manometer again shows a\r\nperfect vacuum when the operation may be considered finished. In the\r\nmanipulation our chief variation from the official method consists in\r\nconnecting the combustion apparatus with the measuring tube before\r\nthe heat is applied to the front end of the combustion tube. Any\r\nparticles of the sample which may have stuck to the sides of the tube\r\non filling will thus be subject to combustion and the gases produced\r\nmeasured. Where it is certain that no such adhesion has taken place it\r\nis somewhat safer on account of the possible presence of occluded gases\r\nto heat the front end of the tube before connecting the combustion\r\napparatus with the azotometer.\r\n\r\n=161. Method of Johnson and Jenkins.=—In the method of Johnson and\r\nJenkins the principal variation from the process described consists\r\nin introducing into the combustion tube a source of oxygen whereby\r\nany difficultly combustible carbon may be easily oxidized and all the\r\nnitrogen be more certainly set free.[135] The potassium chlorate used\r\nfor this purpose is placed in the posterior part of the tube, which is\r\nbent at slight angle to receive it. The sodium bicarbonate is placed\r\nin the anterior end of the tube. The combustion goes on as already\r\ndescribed, and at its close the potassium chlorate is heated to evolve\r\nthe oxygen. The free oxygen is absorbed by the reduced copper oxid, or\r\nconsumed by the unburned carbon. Any excess of oxygen is recognized at\r\nonce by its action on the copper spiral. As soon as this shows signs\r\nof oxidation the evolution of the gas is stopped. Care must be taken\r\nnot to allow the oxygen to come off so rapidly as to escape entire\r\nabsorption by the contents of the combustion tube. In such a case the\r\nnitrogen in the measuring tube would be contaminated.\r\n\r\nIt is rarely necessary in fertilizer analysis to have need of more\r\noxygen than is contained in the copper oxid powder in contact with the\r\nsample during the progress of combustion.\r\n\r\n=162. Calculation of Results.=—The nitrogen originally present in a\r\ndefinite weight of any substance having been obtained in a gaseous form\r\nits volume is read directly in the burette in which it is collected.\r\nThis instrument may be of many forms but the essential feature of\r\nits construction is that it should be accurately calibrated; and the\r\ndivisions so graduated as to permit of the reading of the volume\r\naccurately to a tenth of a cubic centimeter. For this purpose it\r\nis best that the internal diameter of the measuring tube be rather\r\nsmall so that at least each ten cubic centimeters occupies a space\r\nten centimeters long. The volume occupied by any gas varies directly\r\nwith the temperature and inversely with the pressure to which it\r\nis subjected. The quantity of aqueous vapor which a moist gas may\r\ncontain is also a factor to be considered. Inasmuch as the nitrogen\r\nin the above process of analysis is collected over a strong solution\r\nof potassium hydroxid capable of practically keeping the gas in a dry\r\nstate the tension of the aqueous vapor may be neglected.\r\n\r\n=163. Reading the Barometer.=—Nearly all the barometers in use in this\r\ncountry have the scale divided in inches and the thermometers thereunto\r\nattached are graduated in Fahrenheit degrees. This is especially true\r\nof the barometers of the Weather Bureau which are the most reliable\r\nand most easy of access to analysts. It is not necessary to correct\r\nthe reading of the barometer for altitude, but it is important to\r\ntake account of the temperature at the time of observation. There is\r\nnot space here to give minute directions for using a barometer. Such\r\ndirections have been prepared by the Weather Bureau and those desiring\r\nit can get copies of the circular.[136]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a barometer affects its accuracy in two ways. First\r\nthe metal scale expands and contracts with changing temperatures:\r\nSecond, the mercury expands and contracts also at a much greater rate\r\nthan the scale. If a barometer tube hold thirty cubic inches of mercury\r\nthe contents will be one ounce lighter at 80° F. than at 32° F. The\r\ntrue pressure of the air is therefore not shown by the observed height\r\nof the mercurial column unless the temperature of the scale and of the\r\nmercurial column be considered.\r\n\r\nTables of correction for temperature are computed by simple formulas\r\nbased on the known coefficients of expansion of mercury and brass. For\r\nbarometers with brass scales the following formula is used for making\r\nthe correction:\r\n\r\n                   _t_ - 28.63\r\n    C = -_h_ --------------------- .\r\n                  1.113_t_ + 10978\r\n\r\nIn this formula _t_ = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and _h_ =\r\nobserved reading of the barometer in inches.\r\n\r\n    _Example_:—Temperature observed 72°.5\r\n                     Barometer reading observed, 29.415 inches,\r\n\r\n    from which C = 0.1165, and this number, according to the\r\n    conditions of the formula, is to be subtracted from the\r\n    observed reading. The true reading in the case given is,\r\n    therefore,\r\n\r\n    29.298 inches or       744.2 millimeters.\r\n    The observed reading   747.1     “\r\n                           -----\r\n    And the correction       2.9     “\r\n\r\nUnless extremely accurate work be required the correction for\r\ntemperature is of very little importance in nitrogen determinations\r\nin fertilizers. Each instrument sent out by the Weather Bureau is\r\naccompanied by a special card of corrections therefor, but these are of\r\nsmall importance in fertilizer work. In order then to get the correct\r\nweight of the gas from its volume the reading of the thermometer and\r\nbarometer at the time of measurement must be carefully noted. However,\r\nafter the end of the combustion, the azotometer should be carried into\r\nanother room which has not been affected by the combustion and allowed\r\nto stand until it has reached the room temperature.\r\n\r\nEvery true gas changes its volume under varying temperatures at the\r\nsame rate and this rate is the coefficient of gaseous expansion.\r\nFor one degree of temperature it amounts to 0.003665 of its volume.\r\nRepresenting the coefficient of expansion by K the volume of the gas as\r\nread by V, the volume desired at any temperature by V′, the temperature\r\nat which the volume is read by _t_ and the desired temperature by _t′_,\r\nthe change in volume may be calculated by the following formula:\r\n\r\n    V′ = V[1 + K(_t′_ - _t_)].\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the volume of nitrogen obtained by combustion be\r\nthirty-five cubic centimeters, and the temperature of observation 22°.\r\nWhat would be the volume of the gas at 0°?\r\n\r\nMaking the proper substitutions in the formula the equation is reduced\r\nto the form below:\r\n\r\n       V′ = 35[1 + 0.003665(0°-22°)]\r\n    or V′ = 35(1 - 0.08063) = 32.18.\r\n\r\nThirty-five cubic centimeters of nitrogen therefore measured at 22°\r\nbecome 32.18 cubic centimeters when measured at 0°.\r\n\r\nWhen gases are to be converted into weight after having been determined\r\nby volume, their volume at 0° must first be determined; but this\r\nvolume must also be calculated to some definite barometric pressure.\r\nBy common consent this pressure has been taken as that exerted by a\r\ncolumn of mercury 760 millimeters in height. Since the volume of a gas\r\nis inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is subjected, the\r\ncalculation is made according to that simple formula. Let the reading\r\nof the barometer, at the time of taking the volume of gas, be H, and\r\nany other pressure desired H′. Then we have the general formula:\r\n\r\n                               HV\r\n    V : V′ = H′ : H; and V′ = ----.\r\n                               H′\r\n\r\n    _Example_: Let the corrected reading of the barometer at the\r\n    time of noting the volume of the gas be 740 millimeters, and the\r\n    volume of the gas reduced to 0° be 32.18 cubic centimeters. What\r\n    will this volume be at a pressure of 760 millimeters?\r\n\r\n    Substituting the proper values in the formula, we have:\r\n\r\n         (32.18 × 740)\r\n    V′ = ------------- = 31.33\r\n              760\r\n\r\nTherefore, a volume of nitrogen which occupies a space of thirty-five\r\ncubic centimeters at a temperature of 22°, and at a barometric pressure\r\nof 740 millimeters, becomes 31.33 cubic centimeters at a temperature of\r\n0° and a pressure of 760 millimeters.\r\n\r\nOne liter of nitrogen at 0° and 760 millimeters pressure weighs 1.25456\r\ngrams; and one cubic centimeter therefore 0.00125456 gram. To find the\r\nweight of gas obtained in the above supposed analysis, it will only be\r\nnecessary to multiply this number by the volume of nitrogen expressed\r\nin cubic centimeters under the standard conditions; _viz._, 0.0125456 ×\r\n31.33 = 0.039305 gram. If the sample taken for analysis weighed half a\r\ngram, the percentage of nitrogen found would be 7.85.\r\n\r\n=164. Tension of the Aqueous Vapor.=—It has been shown by experience\r\nthat when a gas is collected over a potash solution containing fifty\r\nper cent of potassium hydroxid, the tension of the aqueous vapor is\r\nso far diminished as to be of no perceptible influence on the final\r\nresult. To correct the volume of a gas, therefore, so collected for\r\nthis tension, would involve an unnecessary calculation for practical\r\npurposes. If a gas thus collected should be transferred to a burette\r\nover mercury, on which some water floats, then the correction should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAt 0° the tension of aqueous vapor will support a column of mercury\r\n4.525 millimeters high, and at 40° one of 54.969 millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the tension of aqueous vapors in millimeters\r\nof a mercurial column for each degree of temperature from zero to forty.\r\n\r\n                  Tension of                   Tension of\r\n                   vapor in                     vapor in\r\n    Temperature.  millimeters.

If for instance\r\na gas in contact with water show a volume of thirty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters at 22° and 740 millimeters barometric pressure its volume\r\nis really greater than if it were perfectly dry. How much greater can\r\nbe determined by inspecting the table, for at 22° the tension of water\r\nvapor is 19.675 millimeters of mercury. The real pressure to which\r\nthe volume of gas is subjected is therefore 740 - 19.675 = 720.325\r\nmillimeters.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, in the example given, the nitrogen were in contact with\r\nwater, the calculation would proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n          32.18 × 720.325\r\n    V′ = ----------------- = 30.5,\r\n                760\r\n\r\n    and 30.5 × 1.25456 = 38.26.\r\n\r\nHence, 38.26 milligrams of nitrogen correspond to 7.65 per cent, when\r\nhalf a gram of substance is taken for the combustion.\r\n\r\n=165. Aqueous Tension in Solutions of Potassium Hydroxid.=—Even in\r\nstrong solutions of potassium hydroxid the tension of aqueous vapor is\r\nnot destroyed, but is reduced to a minimum, which is negligible in the\r\ncalculation of the percentage by weight of the nitrogen in a sample of\r\nfertilizer. When dilute solutions of a caustic alkali are used however,\r\nthe neglect of the tension of the aqueous vapor may cause an error of\r\nsome magnitude. In such cases the strength of the solution should be\r\nknown and correction made according to the following table:[137]\r\n\r\n              Millimeters tension of aqueous vapor for KOH solutions of\r\n                                              |\r\n                 +----------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n    Temperature. | 9.09 per  16.66 per  23.08 per  28.57 per  32.89 per |\r\n                    cent.      cent.      cent.      cent.      cent.\r\n       10°.00       8.62       8.01       7.31       6.50       5.62\r\n       11°.00       9.21       8.56       7.82       6.95       6.01\r\n       12°.10       9.90       9.21       8.41       7.47       6.46\r\n       13°.00      10.50       9.77       8.92       7.93       6.86\r\n       13°.95      11.17      10.39       9.49       8.44       7.30\r\n       15°.15      12.06      11.22      10.25       9.11       7.86\r\n       16°.00      12.74      11.85      10.82       9.62       8.33\r\n       17°.00      13.57      12.63      11.54      10.26       8.88\r\n       18°.00      14.46      13.45      12.29      10.93       9.47\r\n       19°.00      15.39      14.33      13.09      11.65      10.09\r\n       20°.00      16.38      15.25      13.93      12.40      10.75\r\n       21°.00      17.42      16.22      14.82      13.20      11.44\r\n       21°.82      18.32      17.06      15.59      13.88      12.04\r\n       23°.00      19.68      18.32      16.75      14.92      12.94\r\n       24°.00      20.92      19.47      17.80      15.86      13.76\r\n       25°.00      22.19      20.67      18.91      16.85      14.62\r\n       26°.00      23.55      21.94      20.07      17.89      15.53\r\n       26°.98      24.95      23.25      21.27      18.96      16.46\r\n       27°.93      26.38      24.59      22.51      20.07      17.45\r\n       29°.00      28.08      26.18      23.96      21.38      18.59\r\n       30°.00      29.76      27.74      25.40      22.67      19.72\r\n       31°.00      31.51      29.38      26.91      24.03      20.91\r\n       32°.13      33.61      31.34      28.72      25.65      22.34\r\n       33°.00      35.30      32.93      30.18      26.97      23.50\r\n       34°.00      37.34      34.84      31.94      28.56      24.89\r\n\r\n=166. Use of Volumetric Method.=—For practical purposes it may be said\r\nthat the volumetric determination of nitrogen in fertilizer analysis\r\nhas gone entirely out of use. For control and comparison it is still\r\noccasionally practiced but it has had to give way to the more speedy\r\nand fully as accurate processes of moist combustion with sulfuric\r\nacid which have come into general use in the last decade. The student\r\nand analyst however should not fail to master its details and become\r\nskilled in its use. There are certain nitrogenous substances such\r\nas the alkaloids which are quite refractory when subjected to moist\r\ncombustion. While such bodies may not occur in fertilizers it is well\r\nto have at hand a means of accurately determining their nitrogen\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n=167. Tables for Calculating Results.=—Where many analyses are to be\r\nmade by the copper oxid process it has proved convenient to shorten the\r\nwork of calculating analyses by taking the data given in computation\r\ntables.[138] Before using these tables it must be known whether they\r\nare calculated on the supposition that the gas is measured in a moist\r\nstate, partly moist, or wholly dry. Where the nitrogen is collected\r\nover water a table must be used in which allowance has been made for\r\nthe tension of aqueous vapor. In case a saturated solution of a caustic\r\nalkali be used in the azotometer it is customary to take no account\r\nof the tension and the table employed must be constructed on this\r\nsupposition. In point of fact even in the strongest alkali solution\r\nthere is a certain amount of tension but this is so slight as only to\r\naffect the results in the second place of percentage decimals. Since,\r\nas a rule, only a few analyses are made by this method it will be\r\nfound safer to use a caustic alkali solution of given strength and to\r\ncalculate the results from the tables of aqueous tensions given above.\r\n\r\n=168. The Soda-Lime Process.=—This process originally perfected\r\nby Varrentrap and Will, and improved by Peligot, was used almost\r\nexclusively by analysts until within the last decade for the\r\ndetermination of nitrogen not existing in the nitric form. It is based\r\non the principle that when nitrogen exists as a salt of ammonia, or as\r\nan amid, or as proteid matter, it is converted into gaseous ammonia\r\nby combustion with an alkali. This ammonia can be carried into a set\r\nsolution of acid by a stream of gas free of ammonia and the excess of\r\nacid remaining after the combustion is complete can be determined by\r\ntitration against a standard alkali solution. The results under proper\r\nconditions are accurate even when a small quantity of nitric nitrogen\r\nis present. When, however, there is any considerable quantity of this\r\ncompound in the sample the method becomes inapplicable by reason of\r\nnon-reduction of some of the nitrogen oxids produced by the combustion.\r\n\r\nIn bodies very rich in nitrogen such as urea all the nitrogen is\r\nnot transformed directly into ammonia at the commencement of the\r\ncombustion. A portion of it may unite with a part of the carbon to form\r\ncyanogen, which may unite with the soda to form sodium cyanid. With an\r\nexcess of alkali, however, and prolonged combustion this product will\r\nbe finally decomposed and all the nitrogen be secured as ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe nascent hydrogen which unites with the nascent nitrogen during\r\nthe combustion is also derived from the organic matter which always\r\ncontains enough carbon to decompose the water formed in order to\r\nbe oxidized to carbon dioxid. While at first, therefore, during\r\ncombustion, the hydrogen may unite with the oxygen, it becomes again\r\nfree by the oxidation of the carbon and in this condition unites with\r\nthe nascent nitrogen to form ammonia. In addition to carbon dioxid,\r\nammonia, and free hydrogen there may also be found among the products\r\nof combustion marsh and olefiant gases and other hydrocarbon compounds\r\nwhich dilute, to a greater or less extent, the ammonia formed and help\r\nto carry it out of the combustion tube and into the standard acid.\r\n\r\n=169. The Official Method.=—_Reagents and Apparatus._—(1) Standard\r\nsolutions and indicator the same as for the kjeldahl method:\r\n\r\n(2) Dry granulated soda-lime, fine enough to pass a 2.5 millimeter\r\nsieve:\r\n\r\n(3) Soda-lime, fine enough to pass a 1.25 millimeter sieve.[139]\r\n\r\nSoda-lime may be easily and cheaply prepared by slaking two and\r\none-half parts of quicklime with a strong solution of one part of\r\ncommercial caustic soda, care being taken that there is enough water in\r\nthe solution to slake the lime. The mixture is then dried and heated in\r\nan iron pot to incipient fusion, and, when cold, ground and sifted as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nInstead of soda-lime Johnson’s mixture of sodium and calcium carbonate,\r\nor slaked lime may be used. Slaked lime may be granulated by mixing\r\nit with a little water to form a thick mass, which is dried in the\r\nwater-oven until hard and brittle. It is then ground and sifted as\r\nabove. Slaked lime is much easier to work with than soda-lime, and\r\ngives excellent results, though it is probable that more of it should\r\nbe used in proportion to the substance to be analyzed than is the case\r\nwith soda-lime.\r\n\r\n(4) Asbestos, which has been ignited and kept in a glass-stoppered\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n(5) Combustion tubes about forty centimeters long and twelve\r\nmillimeters internal diameter, drawn out to a closed point at one end.\r\n\r\n(6) Large-bulbed =U= tubes with glass stop-cock, or Will’s tubes with\r\nfour bulbs.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—The substance to be analyzed should be powdered\r\nfinely enough to pass through a sieve of one millimeter mesh; from\r\nseven-tenths to one and four-tenths grams, according to the amount of\r\nnitrogen present, are taken for the determination. Into the closed\r\nend of the combustion tube, put a small loose plug of asbestos, and\r\nupon it about four centimeters of fine soda-lime. In a porcelain dish\r\nor mortar, mix the substance to be analyzed, thoroughly but quickly,\r\nwith enough fine soda-lime to fill about sixteen centimeters of the\r\ntube, or about forty times as much soda-lime as substance, and put the\r\nmixture into the combustion tube as quickly as possible by means of\r\na wide-necked funnel, rinsing out the dish and funnel with a little\r\nmore fine soda-lime, which is to be put in on top of the mixture. Fill\r\nthe rest of the tube to within about five centimeters of the end with\r\ngranulated soda-lime, making it as compact as possible by tapping\r\nthe tube gently while held in a nearly upright position during the\r\nfilling. The layer of granulated soda-lime should not be less than\r\ntwelve centimeters long. Lastly, put in a plug of asbestos about two\r\ncentimeters long, pressed rather tightly, and wipe out the end of the\r\ntube to free it from adhering soda-lime.\r\n\r\nConnect the tube by means of a well-fitting rubber stopper or cork\r\nwith the =U= tube or Will’s bulbs, containing ten cubic centimeters\r\nof standard acid, and adjust it in the combustion furnace so that the\r\nend of the tube projects about four centimeters from the furnace,\r\nsupporting the =U= tube or Will’s bulb suitably. Heat the portion of\r\nthe tube containing the granulated soda-lime to a moderate redness, and\r\nwhen this is attained extend the heat gradually through the portion\r\ncontaining the substance, so as to keep up a moderate and regular flow\r\nof gases through the bulbs, maintaining the heat of the first part\r\nuntil the whole tube is heated uniformly to the same degree. Continue\r\nthe combustion until gases have ceased bubbling through the acid in the\r\nbulbs, and the mixture of substance and soda-lime has become white, or\r\nnearly so, which shows that the combustion is finished. The process\r\nshould occupy about three-quarters of an hour, or not more than one\r\nhour. Remove the heat, and when the tube has cooled below redness break\r\noff the closed tip and aspirate air slowly through the apparatus for\r\ntwo or three minutes to bring all the ammonia into the acid. Disconnect\r\nthe tube, wash the acid into a beaker or flask, and titrate with the\r\nstandard alkali.\r\n\r\nDuring the combustion the end of the tube projecting from the furnace\r\nmust be kept heated sufficiently to prevent the condensation of\r\nmoisture, yet not enough to char the stopper. The heat may be regulated\r\nby a shield of tin slipped over the projecting end of the combustion\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nIt is found very advantageous to attach a bunsen valve to the exit\r\ntube, allowing the evolved gases to pass out freely, but preventing a\r\nviolent sucking back in case of a sudden condensation of steam in the\r\nbulbs.\r\n\r\n=170. The Official French Method.=—The French chemists prefer to drive\r\nout the traces of ammonia remaining in the combustion tube by means\r\nof the gases arising from the decomposition of oxalic acid.[140] The\r\noperation is conducted by mixing about one gram of oxalic acid with\r\nenough of dry granular soda-lime to form a layer of four centimeters\r\nin length at the bottom of the tube. The rest of the tube is then\r\ncharged substantially as directed above. At the end of the combustion\r\nthe oxalic acid is decomposed by heat furnishing sufficient hydrogen to\r\nremove from the tube all traces of ammonia which it may contain. The\r\nFrench chemists employ, for titration, either normal acids and alkalies\r\nor some decimal thereof or else an acid of such strength as to have\r\neach cubic centimeter thereof correspond to ten milligrams of nitrogen,\r\nthus making the computation of results exceedingly simple. Such an\r\nacid is secured when one liter thereof contains thirty-five grams of\r\npure monohydric sulfuric acid or forty-five grams of pure crystallized\r\noxalic acid. The corresponding alkaline reagent should contain, in each\r\nliter, forty grams of pure potassium hydroxid.\r\n\r\n=171. The Hydrogen Method.=—Thibault and Wagner recommend that\r\nthe combustion with soda-lime be conducted in an atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen,[141] and Loges replaces this by common illuminating gas freed\r\nfrom ammonia by conducting it through a tube filled with glass balls\r\nmoistened with dilute sulfuric acid.[142]\r\n\r\nIn these cases the combustion tube is left open at both ends and the\r\nmaterials under the tube confined to the proper position by asbestos\r\nplugs. The gases used act in a merely mechanical manner and their use\r\naffords so few advantages over the method of aspirating air at the end\r\nof the combustion as to render it unadvisable.\r\n\r\n=172. Coloration of the Product.=—It often happens, especially in the\r\ncombustion of animal products, such as tankage and fish scrap, that the\r\nacid securing the ammonia is deeply colored by the condensation of some\r\nof the other products of combustion. This coloration interferes in a\r\nvery serious way with the delicacy of the indicator used to determine\r\nthe end of the reaction. In this case the liquid may be mixed with an\r\nalkali and distilled and the ammonia secured in a fresh portion of\r\nthe standard acid as in the moist combustion process to be hereafter\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n=173. General Considerations.=—(1) _Preparation of Sample._—In the\r\nsoda-lime method it is of great importance that the organic substances\r\nbe in a fine state of subdivision so as to admit of intimate mixture\r\nwith the alkali. In cases where fragments of hoof, horn, hair, or\r\nsimilar substances are to be prepared for combustion it is advisable\r\nto first decompose them by heating with a small quantity of sulfuric\r\nacid. The excess of acid may be neutralized with marble dust and the\r\nresulting mixture dried, rubbed to a fine powder, and mixed with the\r\nsoda-lime in the usual way. Care must be taken not to lose any of\r\nthe ammonia from the sulfate which may be formed in mixing with the\r\nsoda-lime in filling the tube.\r\n\r\n(2) _Purity of Soda-Lime._—The soda-lime employed must be entirely free\r\nof nitrogenous compounds and some blank combustions should be made in\r\nproof of its purity.\r\n\r\n(3) _Temperature._—The temperature of the combustion should not be\r\nallowed to exceed low redness. At very high temperatures there would be\r\ndanger of decomposing the ammonia.\r\n\r\n(4) _Aspiration of Air._—Before aspiring a current of air through the\r\ntube to remove the last traces of ammonia the gas should be put out\r\nunder the furnace and the tube be allowed to cool below redness to\r\navoid any danger of acting on the nitrogen in the air.\r\n\r\n=174. The Ruffle Soda-Lime Method.=—Many attempts have been made to\r\nadapt the soda-lime method to the determination of nitric nitrogen. Of\r\nthese the process devised by Ruffle is the only one which has proved\r\nsuccessful.[143] The method is founded on the action of sulfurous\r\nvapors on the nitrogen oxids produced during the combustion whereby\r\nsulfuric acid is formed and the nascent nitrogen is joined with\r\nhydrogen to form ammonia. By this process all the nitrogen contained\r\nin the sample, even if in the nitric form, is finally obtained as\r\nammonia. In the original method the reagents employed were a mixture of\r\nsodium thiosulfate and soda-lime and a mixture of charcoal, sulfur, and\r\ngranulated soda-lime. Subsequently the official chemists substituted\r\nsugar for the charcoal.[144] The method was used for a long time by the\r\nofficial chemists and came into general favor until displaced by the\r\nsimpler and cheaper processes of the moist combustion method adapted to\r\nnitric nitrogen. As finally modified and used by the official chemists\r\nthe process was conducted as described below.\r\n\r\n=175. The Official Ruffle Method.=—[145]_Reagents._—(1) Standard\r\nsolutions and indicator the same as for the kjeldahl method.\r\n\r\n(2) A mixture of equal parts by weight of fine-slaked lime and finely\r\npowdered sodium thiosulfate dried at 100°:\r\n\r\n(3) A mixture of equal parts of weight of finely powdered granulated\r\nsugar and flowers of sulfur:\r\n\r\n(4) Granulated soda-lime, as described under the soda-lime method:\r\n\r\n(5) Combustion tubes of hard Bohemian glass seventy centimeters long\r\nand one and three-tenths centimeters in diameter:\r\n\r\n(6) Bulbed =U= tubes or Will’s bulbs, as described under the soda-lime\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—(a) Clean the =U= tube and introduce ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of standard acid.\r\n\r\n(b) Fit the cork and glass connecting tube. Fill the tube as follows:\r\n(1) A loosely fitting plug of asbestos, previously ignited, and then\r\ntwo and five-tenths to three and five-tenths centimeters of the\r\nthiosulfate mixture: (2) The weighed portion of the substance to\r\nbe analyzed is intimately mixed with from five to ten grams of the\r\nsugar and sulfur mixture: (3) Pour on a piece of glazed paper or in\r\na porcelain mortar a sufficient quantity of thiosulfate mixture to\r\nfill about twenty-five centimeters of the tube; then add the substance\r\nto be analyzed, as previously prepared, mix carefully, and pour into\r\nthe tube; shake down the contents of the tube; rinse off the paper or\r\nmortar with a small quantity of the thiosulfate mixture and pour into\r\nthe tube; then fill up with soda-lime to within five centimeters of the\r\nend of the tube: (4) Place another plug of ignited asbestos at the end\r\nof the tube and close with a cork: (5) Hold the tube in a horizontal\r\nposition and tap on the table until there is a gas-channel along the\r\ntop of the tube: (6) Make connection with the =U= tube containing the\r\nacid; aspirate and see that the apparatus is tight.\r\n\r\n_The Combustion._—Place the prepared combustion tube in the furnace,\r\nletting the open end project a little, so as not to burn the cork.\r\nCommence by heating the soda-lime portion until it is brought to a full\r\nred heat. Then turn on slowly jet after jet toward the outer end of\r\nthe tube, so that the bubbles come off two or three a second. When the\r\nwhole tube is red hot and the evolution of the gas has ceased and the\r\nliquid in the =U= tube begins to recede toward the furnace, attach the\r\naspirator to the other limb of the =U= tube, break off the end of the\r\ntube, and draw a current of air through for a few minutes. Detach the\r\n=U= tube and wash the contents into a beaker or porcelain dish; add a\r\nfew drops of the cochineal solution, and titrate.\r\n\r\n=176. Observations.=—In our experience we have found it much more\r\nsatisfactory to adhere to the earlier directions for preparing the\r\nmixture of thiosulfate and alkali. We much prefer to make the mixture\r\nwith soda-lime and without the previous drying of the sodium salt.\r\nRuffle himself says that the sodium thiosulfate should be dry but not\r\ndeprived of its water of crystallization.[146] The best method to dry\r\nthe crystal powder without depriving it of its crystal water is to\r\npress it between blotting papers. The official method also contains\r\na typographical error in prescribing that the combustion tube should\r\nhave a length of thirty centimeters where evidently thirty inches were\r\nmeant. Ruffle’s original tube was twenty-two inches in length.\r\n\r\nAs is seen from the above description the method is essentially a\r\nreduction process by the action of a powerful deoxidizer in the\r\npresence of an alkali. The crystals of the thiosulfate salt cannot be\r\nbrought into direct contact with a pure alkali, like soda or potash,\r\nwithout forming at once a wet mass which would tend to cake and\r\nobstruct the tube. The soda-lime is therefore a mechanical device to\r\nprevent this fusion. Where many analyses are to be made an iron tube,\r\nfor economical reasons, may be substituted for the glass; but the glass\r\ntube permits a more intelligent observation of the progress of the\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nSince charcoal has very high absorbent powers it will be found always\r\nto contain a little nitrogen which may be in a form to generate ammonia\r\nduring the combustion. The charcoal used should therefore be previously\r\nboiled with caustic soda or potash solution, dried, powdered, and\r\npreserved in well-stoppered bottles. Although pure sugar is practically\r\nfree of nitrogen, even when it is used, it is advisable to occasionally\r\nmake a blank determination and thus ascertain the correction to be made\r\nfor possible contamination.\r\n\r\n=177. Boyer’s Modification of Ruffle’s Method.=—The principle of\r\nthe method rests on the observation that if nitrates be heated in\r\na combustion tube with calcium oxalate and soda-lime, not more\r\nthan two-thirds of the total nitrogen appear as ammonia; but if a\r\ncertain proportion of sulfur be added the whole of the nitrogen is\r\nrecovered.[23] The process may be divided into two reactions; _viz._:\r\n\r\n(1) Action of the calcium oxalate upon the sodium nitrate in presence\r\nof soda-lime:\r\n\r\n(2) The action of sulfurous acid and of calcium oxalate upon the sodium\r\nnitrate in presence of soda-lime.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is conducted as follows: Dry and pulverize one-half gram\r\nof nitrate (Na or K) and mix it intimately with fifty grams of the\r\nreducing compound containing approximately ten per cent sulfur, 22.5\r\nper cent neutral calcium oxalate, and 67.5 per cent soda-lime. The\r\ncombustion tube is charged as follows:\r\n\r\nLength of tube fifty-five centimeters:\r\n\r\nDiameter of tube seventeen millimeters:\r\n\r\nAdd first two grams pulverized calcium oxalate:\r\n\r\n    Add next ten grams pulverized soda-lime:\r\n\r\n     “   “ ten grams of the reducing compound:\r\n\r\n     “   “ the nitrate incorporated with fifty grams of the reducing\r\n           mixture:\r\n\r\n    Add next ten grams of the reducing mixture:\r\n\r\n     “   “ ten grams pulverized soda-lime:\r\n\r\nThe tube is then lightly closed with an asbestos plug.\r\n\r\nThe tube is heated gradually from the front backwards, the calcium\r\noxalate furnishing finally the gas necessary to drive out the\r\nlast traces of ammonia. The process is equally applicable to the\r\ndetermination of nitrogen in all its forms or to mixtures thereof.\r\n\r\nThe method has also been applied to the mixture of ammoniacal and\r\norganic nitrogen and to the mixture of ammoniacal, nitric, and organic\r\nnitrogen, the combustions having been made both in an iron and a glass\r\ntube. The amounts of material to be used vary from one-half gram to a\r\ngram, according to its richness in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe combustion should be terminated in forty minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen a combustion is terminated, the acid containing the ammonia is\r\nplaced in a beaker and boiled for two or three minutes to drive off the\r\nsulfurous and carbonic acids. The titration is then conducted in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\nThe combustion can be carried on just as well in an iron tube as\r\nin a glass one. The reagents employed, especially soda-lime, being\r\nhygroscopic, a little water is disengaged in heating, which is\r\ncondensed at the cold extremity of the tube, and which may absorb\r\na little ammonia, unless special precautions are taken to have the\r\nmaterials dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOIST COMBUSTION PROCESS.\r\n\r\n=178. Historical.=—As long ago as 1868 Wanklyn proposed to conduct the\r\ncombustion of organic bodies in a wet way, using potassium permanganate\r\nas the oxidizing body.[147] About ten years after this he attempted\r\nto extend the method so as to estimate the quantity of proteid matter\r\nin a sample by treatment with an alkaline solution in presence of the\r\npermanganate salt. One gram of the finely pulverized sample was treated\r\nin a liter flask with one-tenth normal potash lye. After digestion for\r\nsome time, from ten to twenty cubic centimeters were taken for the\r\ndetermination. According to the supposition of Wanklyn, pure albuminoid\r\nmatters thus treated yielded one-tenth of their weight of ammonia,\r\nor about fifty per cent of the total nitrogen appeared as ammonia.\r\nThe ammonia content of the sample was determined by the colorimetric\r\nprocess devised by Nessler. It is needless to add that the process of\r\nWanklyn proved to be of no practical use whatever, acting differently\r\non different albuminoid matters, and even on the same substance.\r\nNo other attempt was made to perfect the moist combustion process\r\nuntil Kjeldahl[148] introduced the sulfuric acid method in 1883. The\r\nsimplicity, economy, and adaptability of this method have brought it\r\ninto general use. At first the process was only applied to organic\r\nnitrogenous compounds in the absence of nitrates, but especially by\r\nthe modifications proposed by Asboth, Jodlbaur, and Scovell, it has\r\nbeen made applicable to all cases, with the possible exception of a\r\nfew alkaloidal and allied bodies. The moist combustion process for\r\ndetermining nitrogen is now generally employed by chemists in all\r\ncountries, not only for fertilizer control, but also for general work.\r\n\r\n=179. The Method of Kjeldahl.=—The process originally proposed by\r\nKjeldahl is applicable only to nitrogenous bodies free of nitric\r\nnitrogen. The principle of the process is based on the action of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid at the boiling-point in decomposing\r\nnitrogenous compounds without producing volatile combinations and\r\nthe subsequent completion of the oxidation by means of potassium\r\npermanganate. The original process has been modified by many analysts\r\nbut the basic principle of it has remained unchanged. It will therefore\r\nprove useful here to describe the process as originally given.[149]\r\n\r\nThe weighed substance is placed in a small flask. With solid bodies\r\nthis is a very simple operation, but with liquids more difficult.\r\nLiquids which are not decomposed, on heating, should be evaporated in\r\na thin glass dish which can be ground up and placed in the digestion\r\nflask with the desiccated sample. The strongest sulfuric acid is added\r\nin sufficient quantity to secure complete decomposition, not less than\r\nten cubic centimeters in any case. The acid must be free of ammonia and\r\nbe kept in such a way as not to absorb ammonia from the atmosphere of\r\nthe laboratory. To guard against danger of error from such an impurity\r\nfrequent control determinations should be made. In control experiments\r\none or two grams of pure sugar should be used as the organic matter. If\r\nthe acid employed contain traces of ammonia the necessary corrections\r\nshould be made in each analysis. The flask having been charged is\r\nplaced on a wire gauze over a small flame. The organic matter becomes\r\nblack and tar-like and soon there is a rapid decomposition attended\r\nwith the evolution of gaseous products among which sulfur dioxid is\r\nfound. To avoid danger from spurting, the digestion flask should be\r\nplaced in an oblique position. The flask should have, at least, a\r\ncapacity of 100 cubic centimeters and a long neck and be made of a\r\nkind of glass capable of withstanding the action of the boiling acid.\r\nParticles of the carbonized organic matter left on the sides of the\r\nflask by the foaming of the mass at first are gradually dissolved by\r\nthe vapors of the boiling acid as the digestion proceeds. The action\r\nof the sulfuric acid is not entirely finished when gases cease to be\r\ngiven off but the digestion should be continued until the liquid in the\r\nflask is clear and colorless or nearly so. Usually about two hours are\r\nrequired to secure this result. When aided by the means mentioned below\r\nthe time of digestion can be very materially shortened. By adding some\r\nfuming sulfuric acid, or glacial phosphoric acid, the dilution caused\r\nby the formation of water in the combustion of the organic matter, can\r\nbe avoided. For albuminoid bodies it is hardly necessary to continue\r\nthe combustion until all carbonaceous matter is destroyed. The full\r\ncomplement of ammonia is usually obtained after an hour’s combustion\r\neven if the liquid be still black or brown, but with other nitrogenous\r\nbodies the case is different so that upon the whole it is safest to\r\nsecure complete decoloration.\r\n\r\nThe temperature must be maintained at the boiling-point of the acid\r\nor near thereto since at a lower temperature, for instance from 100°\r\nto 150°, the formation of ammonia is incomplete. Since all organic\r\nsubstances of whatever kind are dissolved by the boiling acid the\r\nprevious pulverization of the material need be carried only far enough\r\nto secure a fair sample. Many substances give up practically all\r\ntheir nitrogen as ammonium sulfate when heated with sulfuric acid as,\r\nfor instance, urea, asparagin, and the glutens. In most of the other\r\norganic bodies fully ninety per cent of the nitrogen are likewise\r\nsecured as the ammonium salt. In the aromatic compounds, or even in\r\nthe form of amid in anilin salts, the nitrogen is more resistant to\r\nthe action of sulfuric acid. In the alkaloids where the nitrogen is\r\nprobably a real component of the benzol skeleton the formation of\r\nammonia is very incomplete. But even in the cases where the conversion\r\nof the nitrogen into ammonia is practically perfect it is advisable\r\nto finish the process by completing the oxidation with potassium\r\npermanganate. The permanganate should be used in a dry powdered form\r\nand added little by little to the hot contents of the digestion flask,\r\nthe latter being held in an upright position and removed meanwhile\r\nfrom the lamp. When carefully performed there is no danger of loss\r\nof ammonia although the oxidation is, at times, so vigorous as to be\r\nattended with evolution of light. The permanganate must always be added\r\nin excess and until a permanent green color is produced. The flask is\r\nthen gently heated for from five to ten minutes over a small flame, but\r\nthis is not important. The heating must not be too strong or else a\r\nstrong evolution of oxygen will take place with a consequent reduction\r\nof the manganese compound. When this happens the liquid again becomes\r\nclear and there is a loss of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAfter cooling, the contents of the flask are diluted with water, the\r\ngreen color giving place to a brown with a rise of temperature. After\r\ncooling a second time the whole is brought into a distillation flask of\r\nabout three-quarters of a liter capacity and attached to a condenser\r\nwhich ends in a vessel containing titrated sulfuric acid. About forty\r\ncubic centimeters of sodium hydroxid solution of one and three-tenths\r\nspecific gravity are added and the stopper at once inserted to prevent\r\nany loss of ammonia. To prevent bumping during the distillation some\r\nzinc dust is added securing an evolution of hydrogen during the\r\nprogress of the distillation. In this case the bumping is prevented\r\nuntil near the end of the operation when it begins anew, probably by\r\nreason of the separation of solid sodium sulfate. After the end of\r\nthe distillation, the excess of acid remaining in the receiver is\r\ndetermined by a set alkali solution and thus the quantity of ammonia\r\nobtained easily calculated. Kjeldahl, however, preferred to titrate the\r\nsolution after adding potassium iodate and iodid, a mixture which in\r\nthe presence of a strong acid sets free a quantity of iodin equivalent\r\nto the free acid present. The iodin thus set free is titrated by a set\r\nsolution of sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The merits\r\nof this method are sharpness of the end reaction and the possibility of\r\nusing only a small quantity of the nitrogenous body for the combustion.\r\nThe sulfuric acid used in the receiver is made of the same strength as\r\nthe thiosulfate solution; _viz._, about one-twentieth normal. Thirty\r\ncubic centimeters of this were found to be the proper amount for use\r\nwith substances taken in such quantities as to produce ammonia enough\r\nto neutralize about half of it. The titration is carried on as follows:\r\nA few crystals of potassium iodid are dissolved in the acid mixture\r\nobtained after the distillation is completed, then a few drops of the\r\nstarch-paste and finally a few drops of a four per cent solution of\r\npotassium iodate. The iodin set free is then oxidized by the addition\r\nof the one-twentieth normal sodium thiosulfate solution until the blue\r\ncolor disappears.\r\n\r\n    _Example_: Sulfuric acid used,  30 cc.\r\n    Equivalent to sodium thiosulfate,    30 cc.\r\n    Blank combustion required,           29.8 cc thiosulfate solution.\r\n    Combustion of 0.645 gram of barley   14.5 cc      “         “\r\n       required,                         -------\r\n    Thiosulfate corresponding to barley, 15.3 cc.\r\n\r\nIn the computation it is more simple to multiply the corresponding\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of thiosulfate by seven, half the atomic\r\nweight of nitrogen, and divide the product by the weight of the\r\nsubstance taken, which will give the per cent of nitrogen therein.\r\n\r\n          15.3 × 7\r\n    Then ---------- × 100 = 1.66 = per cent of nitrogen in sample taken.\r\n            0.645\r\n\r\nA more detailed description of the method of making the titration\r\nfollows: After the distillation is finished the condensing-tube is\r\nrinsed with a little water, after which the sulfuric acid unneutralized\r\nin the receiver is determined. It is advisable first to test the\r\nreaction of the distillate with litmus paper before going any further;\r\nfor if at any time all the acid should be found neutralized it will\r\nbe necessary to add a sufficient quantity of one-twentieth normal\r\nsulfuric acid before adding the potassium iodid, etc., otherwise the\r\ndetermination will be irreparably lost. Add to the contents of the\r\nflask ten cubic centimeters of the potassium iodid and two cubic\r\ncentimeters of the potassium iodate solutions, described further on,\r\nand the sodium thiosulfate is then run in from a burette till the\r\nfluid, which is constantly kept agitated by shaking the flask, shows\r\nonly a bare trace of yellow coloration from the iodin still present.\r\nStarch solution is then added, and the blue color obtained is at once\r\nremoved by additional thiosulfate solution. When some experience has\r\nbeen gained, the eye is able to discern, with great certainty, even the\r\nslight coloration caused by only a small trace of free iodin.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sensitiveness of the end reaction and the accuracy\r\nof the result, this method of titration leaves nothing to be wished\r\nfor. The strength of the thiosulfate solution is determined in exactly\r\nthe same manner, and with starch as an indicator. For this purpose,\r\nmeasure ten cubic centimeters of one-twentieth normal sulfuric acid\r\ninto an erlenmeyer, add 120 cubic centimeters of ammonia-free water,\r\nten cubic centimeters of potassium iodid solution, and two cubic\r\ncentimeters of iodate solution; add thiosulfate solution till the fluid\r\nshows only the above-mentioned light yellow tint, then add starch,\r\nand finally thiosulfate. In this way the strength of the thiosulfate\r\nis ascertained, which of course must be occasionally re-determined,\r\nunder exactly the same conditions as with the nitrogen determinations\r\nthemselves, and every possible error is thereby excluded. That the\r\nsolution once decolorized within a short time again assumes a deep blue\r\ncolor, is a matter of no concern, inasmuch as both solutions are added\r\nin such a manner that the end reaction lies exactly at the point when\r\nthe starch iodid reaction distinctly disappears.\r\n\r\n=180. Theory of the Reactions.=—As has been seen above the final\r\nproduct of heating a nitrogenous organic compound with sulfuric acid\r\nand an oxidizing body is ammonium sulfate. The various steps by which\r\nthis is obtained have been traced by Dafert:[150]\r\n\r\n(1) The sulfuric acid abstracts from the organic matter the elements of\r\nwater:\r\n\r\n(2) The sulfur dioxid produced by the action of the residual carbon on\r\nsulfuric acid exercises a reducing effect on the nitrogenous bodies\r\npresent:\r\n\r\n(3) From the nitrogenous bodies produced by the above reduction ammonia\r\nis formed by the action of an oxidizing body:\r\n\r\n(4) The ammonia formed is at once fixed by the acid as ammonium\r\nsulfate. According to the theory of Asboth the hydrogen which is formed\r\nduring the action of sulfuric acid on organic matter, when in a nascent\r\nstate, also aids greatly in the production of ammonia. This idea is\r\nbased on the fact that with those bodies which afford a deficit of\r\nhydrogen the formation of ammonia is imperfect.[151]\r\n\r\n=181. Preparation of Reagents.=—(1) _Pure Sulfuric Acid._—As is well\r\nknown the so-called pure sulfuric acid in the market usually contains\r\nammonia, a fact which compelled Kjeldahl to determine the quantity\r\nof nitrogen in the acid in every instance, and to make correction\r\nfor the same in the analysis. An acid absolutely free from this\r\nimpurity may, however, easily be prepared by the distillation of the\r\ncommercial article in a small glass retort holding easily about 400\r\ncubic centimeters. To conduct this operation without danger it is only\r\nnecessary to arrange the apparatus so that the heavy fluid is heated\r\nto boiling, not from the bottom of the retort, but from its sides,\r\nand that the upper portion of the body and neck is kept sufficiently\r\nwarm so that the sulfuric acid fumes are not allowed to condense and\r\nflow back into the retort. Both these ends are attained simply by\r\nsurrounding the retort with a piece of sheet iron, cylinder-shaped\r\nbeneath, and with an oval upper part, having an opening of about one\r\ncentimeter in diameter for the neck of the retort. To conduct the\r\ndistillation a burner is used with an arrangement for spreading the\r\nflame. To avoid with certainty all bumping of the sulfuric acid and\r\nthe resulting danger therefrom, the lamp is so arranged that only the\r\nproducts of combustion go up between the retort and its iron hood,\r\nwithout allowing the flame itself to come into contact with the glass\r\nvessel. The retort should be filled about half full, or with 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of acid. By this device, without any danger whatever,\r\nabout one liter of sulfuric acid may be distilled in a day. The retort\r\nwill stand numerous distillations. Once begun, the distillation takes\r\ncare of itself; it is necessary to discontinue it when only the bottom\r\nof the retort is covered with sulfuric acid, and to fill fresh acid\r\nthrough a funnel when the retort has cooled off. The first twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the distillate going over are collected by themselves\r\nand rejected. What comes over later is, as shown by experience,\r\nabsolutely ammonia-free, and can be used without any correction, for\r\nthe nitrogen determinations according to Kjeldahl. The acid is kept in\r\na stoppered bottle in a place not reached by ammonia fumes. The ten\r\ncubic centimeter pipette used for measuring the quantity of sulfuric\r\nacid required for each determination, is fastened in the perforated\r\nrubber stopper with which the bottle is kept closed, and is itself\r\nclosed above by a small rubber tube with a plug of glass wool in it.\r\n\r\n(2) _Potassium Permanganate._—Crystals of this salt are crushed\r\n(not pulverized) with a pestle into small pieces of about one-half\r\nmillimeter size, which are kept in a long glass tube of about ten\r\nmillimeters diameter, closed with a stopper.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ammonia-free Water._—Common distilled water cannot be used in the\r\ndetermination of nitrogen according to Kjeldahl, since it contains\r\nammonia. It may be obtained free from the same by redistillation in a\r\nlarge glass retort with the addition of a few drops of sulfuric acid.\r\nAll vessels used in the determination are rinsed out beforehand with\r\nthis water.\r\n\r\n(4) _Ammonia-free Soda-lye_ is most conveniently prepared by adding 270\r\ngrams of common sodium hydroxid in sticks, little by little, to one\r\nliter of distilled water which is kept continually boiling, by means of\r\na small flame, in a good-sized silver dish. The dish is kept covered\r\nwith a glass plate. Care has to be exercised not to add the alkali too\r\nrapidly, nor in too large quantities at a time for in this case the\r\nfluid will boil too violently at every addition of the alkali. After\r\nthe operation is finished the lye is at once siphoned into a glass\r\nflask, and when cold, is poured into a glass-stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\n(5) _One-twentieth Normal Sulfuric Acid_ is prepared from sulfuric acid\r\nand water both absolutely ammonia-free, and is kept in a place where no\r\nfumes of ammonia can reach it, in a well-stoppered glass bottle, the\r\nstopper being smeared with vaseline.\r\n\r\n(6) _Sodium Thiosulfate Solution._—This should be of the same strength\r\nas the one-twentieth normal sulfuric acid. It is prepared by dissolving\r\nthe salt in ammonia-free water, and is compared with the acid, to\r\nwhich has been added potassium iodid and iodate, using starch as an\r\nindicator, in the manner described above. The solution is kept in a\r\nwell-stoppered bottle, in the dark. When the salt and water used are\r\nperfectly pure, it will keep unchanged for a long time.\r\n\r\n(7) _Potassium Iodid._—Dissolve five grams of chemically pure potassium\r\niodid in ammonia-free water and make the volume 100 cubic centimeters.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of this solution are used for each determination;\r\nkeep the solution in the dark and in a well-stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\n(8) _Potassium Iodate._—Dissolve four grams of chemically pure\r\npotassium iodate in ammonia-free water and make the volume 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters. Use two cubic centimeters of this solution for each\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n(9) _Starch Solution._—Digest pure starch for about a week with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, wash perfectly free from chlorin by decantation, and\r\nfinally dry it between filter-paper. The starch is then dissolved in\r\nwater with the aid of heat. Such a solution will keep for an indefinite\r\ntime, if it be saturated with common salt. Ten grams of this starch are\r\ndissolved in 1,000 cubic centimeters of ammonia-free water; use one or\r\ntwo cubic centimeters for each determination.\r\n\r\n=182. Kjeldahl Method as Practiced by the Holland Royal Experiment\r\nStation.=—_Necessary Reagents_: 1. Phosphosulfuric acid, made by mixing\r\na liter of sulfuric acid of specific gravity 1.84 with 200 grams of\r\nphosphoric anhydrid:\r\n\r\n2. Alkaline sodium sulfid solution, made by dissolving 500 grams of\r\nsodium hydroxid and six grams of sodium sulfid or eight and one-half\r\ngrams of potassium sulfid, in a liter of water:\r\n\r\n3. Mercury:\r\n\r\n4. Paraffin in small pieces:\r\n\r\n5. Dilute sulfuric acid and dilute potash solution, both of known\r\nstrength:\r\n\r\n6. Pieces of previously ignited pumice stone or of granulated zinc:\r\n\r\n7. Neutral solution of rosolic acid or litmus.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus_: The apparatus necessary consists of oxidation flasks of\r\nabout 200 cubic centimeters capacity and distillation flasks of about\r\n500 cubic centimeters capacity, both of bohemian glass. Copper may be\r\nused for the distillation flasks.[152]\r\n\r\n_The Process_: A gram of the sample to be analyzed is placed in\r\nan oxidation flask together with twenty cubic centimeters of\r\nphosphosulfuric acid and a drop of mercury, about 600 milligrams,\r\nand heated till the fluid becomes colorless. After cooling, dilute\r\nand wash the contents of the flask into a distillation flask. The\r\nresulting volume should be about 300 cubic centimeters. Add 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the alkaline sodium sulfid solution and some pieces of\r\nignited pumice stone or granulated zinc. Distill the ammonia, receiving\r\nthe distillate in a flask containing a known volume of the standard\r\nsulfuric acid. Titrate with tenth-normal potash, using litmus or\r\nrosolic acid as indicator.\r\n\r\n=183. The Kjeldahl Method as Practiced at the Halle Station.=—The\r\nmethod at present in vogue in the German stations of conducting the\r\nmoist combustion process is well illustrated by the method of procedure\r\nfollowed at Halle.[29] From seven-tenths to one and five-tenths grams\r\nof the sample are taken for analysis according to its richness in\r\nnitrogen. Because of the fact that so small a quantity of the sample is\r\ntaken it is of the highest importance that it be perfectly homogeneous\r\nthroughout its entire mass. Otherwise, grave errors may arise. From\r\nthe sample, as sent to the laboratory, the analyst should take a\r\nsubsample and this should be rubbed to a fine powder and the part used\r\nfor analysis carefully taken therefrom. If the sample be moist it may\r\nbe rubbed up with an equal weight of gypsum, in which case a double\r\nquantity is taken for the determination. Substances like bone-meal,\r\nwhich do not keep well mixed, especially when occasionally shaken,\r\nshould be intimately mixed before each weighing. The sample taken for\r\nanalysis is placed in a glass flask of about 150 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity. The flasks should be made of a special glass to withstand\r\nthe tension of the combustion. Those made by Kavalier at Sazava, in\r\nBohemia, have proved to be the most lasting. A globule of mercury\r\nweighing a little less than one gram is placed in the flask and also\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of pure sulfuric acid of 1.845 specific\r\ngravity. The mercury is conveniently measured by an apparatus suggested\r\nby Wrampelmayer. It consists of an iron tube holding mercury, and is\r\nconveniently filled, from time to time, from a supply vessel placed\r\nin a higher position and joined by means of a heavy glass tube and\r\nrubber tube connections. The lower end of the iron tube is provided\r\nwith a movable iron stopper having a pocket just large enough to hold\r\na globule of mercury, weighing a little less than a gram. On turning\r\nthe stopper the pocket is brought opposite a discharge orifice and the\r\nmeasured globule of mercury is discharged. With substances which tend\r\nto produce a strong foaming a little paraffin is used. The flasks after\r\nthey are charged are placed on circular digesting ovens under a hood as\r\nshown in figure 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11. MOIST COMBUSTION APPARATUS OF THE HALLE\r\nAGRICULTURAL LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nAt first the tripodal support of the flasks is so turned as to bring\r\nthem between the lamps and in this way a too rapid reaction is at\r\nfirst avoided. After half an hour the tripods are so turned as to\r\nbring each flask directly over the lamp, the flame of which is allowed\r\nto impinge directly against the glass. The flame is so regulated\r\nthat after the evolution of the sulfur dioxid has nearly ceased the\r\ncontents of the flask are brought into gentle ebullition. The boiling\r\nis continued until the contents of the flask are colorless, usually\r\nabout two hours. As a rule such substances as cottonseed-meal and\r\ndried blood will take a longer time for complete combustion than other\r\nfertilizing materials. During the combustion the flasks are closed with\r\nan oblong loose-fitting unground glass stopper. When the oxidation is\r\nfinished the contents of the flasks are allowed to cool, the stoppers\r\nare removed, and enough water is added to fill the flasks about\r\nthree-quarters full. The flasks are gently shaken, and the possibility\r\nof breaking, from the heat developed, must not be overlooked. To avoid\r\nconfusion the flasks are all numbered before beginning the work, and\r\nthe numbers noted by the analyst in connection with the samples. The\r\ncontents of each one are next poured into the distillation flask and\r\nthe digestion vessels are washed with 100 cubic centimeters of water in\r\nthree portions, and the wash-water added to the liquid. Sometimes in\r\nwashing out the digestion flask yellow basic mercury compounds separate\r\non its walls, but this does not, in any way, influence the accuracy\r\nof the results. The distillation flasks should have about 600 cubic\r\ncentimeters capacity. To avoid the transfer the digestion may take\r\nplace in the distillation flask in which case the latter must be made\r\nof special glass as indicated.\r\n\r\nTo the liquid thus transferred are added seventy-five cubic centimeters\r\nof soda-lye containing one and one-half times as much potassium sulfid\r\nas is necessary to combine with the mercuric sulfate present. The lye\r\nis of such a strength that sixty cubic centimeters are sufficient to\r\nneutralize the acid present. It has a specific gravity of 1.375 and\r\ncontains thirty-three grams of potassium sulfid in a liter.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the bumping which may take place during the\r\ndistillation, some granulated zinc should be added.\r\n\r\nThe distillation flask is closed with a rubber stopper carrying a\r\nbulb-tube which ends above in a glass tube about three-quarters of a\r\nmeter long, bent at an acute angle, and passing obliquely downward on\r\na convenient support. This tube is connected by a rubber, with the end\r\ntube bent nearly at a right angle and dipping into the standardized\r\nacid in the erlenmeyer receiver. The general arrangement of the\r\ndistilling apparatus is shown in figure 12. Since the contents of\r\nthe vessel are warmed by mixing with the soda-lye, the flame can be\r\nturned on at full head at once at the commencement of the operation.\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour the liquid in the receiver will be\r\nat the boiling-point, and the boiling should be continued for five\r\nminutes more, making twenty minutes in all for the completion of the\r\ndistillation. By this boiling the contents of the receiver are not\r\ncharged with carbon dioxid, as might happen if a condenser were used.\r\nThe receiver contains twenty cubic centimeters of a standardized\r\nsulfuric acid solution and about fifty cubic centimeters of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12. DISTILLATION APPARATUS OF HALLE\r\nAGRICULTURAL LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nThe acid used should contain 38.1 grams of sulfuric acid of 1.845\r\nspecific gravity in a liter; and it should be set by titration with\r\nchemically pure sodium carbonate. For this purpose seven-tenths gram of\r\nsodium carbonate is heated in a platinum crucible for two hours over a\r\nsmall flame, weighed, and placed in an erlenmeyer together with twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of the sulfuric acid, care being taken to avoid loss\r\nfrom the vigorous evolution of carbon dioxid. After boiling for ten\r\nminutes all the carbon dioxid is removed from solution. After cooling,\r\nthe excess of acid is determined by titration with a standardized\r\nbarium hydroxid solution, using rosolic acid as indicator.\r\n\r\nThe solution of barium hydroxid is made as follows: Digest, with warm\r\nwater, 260 grams of caustic baryta, Ba(OH)₂, until it is nearly all\r\ndissolved, filter, and make up to a volume of ten liters and keep in\r\na flask free of carbon dioxid. A solution of barium hydroxid is to be\r\npreferred to the corresponding sodium compound for titration. If traces\r\nof carbonate be formed in the two liquids, the sodium salt will remain\r\nin solution while the barium compound will settle at the bottom of the\r\nflask.\r\n\r\n_The Indicator._—The indicator used to determine the end of the\r\nreaction is made by dissolving one gram of rosolic acid in fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of alcohol. From one to two drops are enough for each\r\ntitration. The color reaction is less definite as the quantity of\r\nammonia in the liquid increases. When the titration solutions have been\r\nprepared as above described it is found to require about ninety of the\r\nbarium hydroxid to neutralize twenty cubic centimeters of the sulfuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nBy direct titration with sodium carbonate it is ascertained how many\r\ngrams of nitrogen the twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Suppose the weight of the dried sodium carbonate prepared as\r\nabove directed is 0.6989 gram.\r\n\r\n                  ½Na₂CO₃,              ½N₂\r\n    Then 0.6989  :  53         = x   :  14\r\n\r\nWhence x = 0.184615 gram of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nSuppose further that twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid solution\r\nrequire ninety-four cubic centimeters of barium hydroxid for complete\r\nsaturation and after treatment with the above amount of sodium\r\ncarbonate, ten and a half cubic centimeters of the barium solution to\r\nneutralize the remaining acid.\r\n\r\nThen 94 - 10.5 = 83.5\r\n\r\nAnd 0.184615: 83.5 = x: 94.\r\n\r\nWhence x = 0.207830 gram of nitrogen corresponding to twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the sulfuric acid used.\r\n\r\nThen 0.20783 ÷ 94 = 0.002211 gram of nitrogen corresponding to one\r\ncubic centimeter of the barium hydroxid solution.\r\n\r\nIf then in the analysis of a fertilizer it is found that 60.5 cubic\r\ncentimeters are required to neutralize the excess of sulfuric acid\r\nafter distillation the percentage of nitrogen in the sample is found as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n60.5 × 0.002211 = 0.13377.\r\n\r\n0.20783 - 0.13377 = 0.07406.\r\n\r\n0.07406 × 100 = 7.406 = per cent nitrogen in sample when one gram is\r\ntaken for the combustion.\r\n\r\n=184. The Official Kjeldahl Method. Not Applicable in the Presence of\r\nNitrates.=[153]—_Reagents._—(1) _Acids._—(_a_) _Standard hydrochloric\r\nacid_ the absolute strength of which has been determined by\r\nprecipitating with silver nitrate, and weighing the silver chlorid as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTo any convenient quantity of the acid to be standardized, add solution\r\nof silver nitrate in slight excess, and two cubic centimeters of pure\r\nnitric acid, of specific gravity 1.2. Heat to boiling-point, and\r\nkeep at this temperature for some minutes without allowing violent\r\nebullition, constantly stirring until the precipitate assumes the\r\ngranular form. Allow to cool somewhat, and then pass the fluid\r\nthrough the asbestos. Wash the precipitate by decantation, with 200\r\ncubic centimeters of very hot water, to which have been added eight\r\ncubic centimeters of nitric acid and two cubic centimeters of dilute\r\nsolution of silver nitrate containing one gram of the salt in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. The washing by decantation is performed by adding\r\nthe hot mixture in small quantities at a time, and beating up the\r\nprecipitate well with a thin glass rod after each addition. The pump is\r\nkept in action all the time, but to keep out dust during the washing\r\nthe cover is only removed from the crucible when the fluid is to be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nPut the vessels containing the precipitate aside, return the washings\r\nonce through the asbestos so as to obtain them quite clear, remove\r\nthem from the receiver, and set aside to recover the excess of silver.\r\nRinse the receiver and complete the washing of the precipitate with\r\nabout 200 cubic centimeters of cold water. Half of this is used to\r\nwash by decantation and the remainder to transfer the precipitate to\r\nthe crucible with the aid of a trimmed feather. Finish washing in the\r\ncrucible, the lumps of silver chlorid being broken down with a glass\r\nrod. Remove the second filtrate from the receiver and pass about\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of ninety-eight per cent alcohol through the\r\nprecipitate. Dry at from 140° to 150°. Exposure for half an hour is\r\nfound more than sufficient, at this temperature, to dry the precipitate\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Standard sulfuric acid_, the absolute strength of which has\r\nbeen determined by precipitation with barium chlorid and weighing the\r\nresulting barium sulfate:\r\n\r\nFor ordinary work half normal acid is recommended, _i. e._, containing\r\n18.2285 grams of hydrochloric or 24.5185 grams sulfuric acid to\r\nthe liter; for work in determining very small amounts of nitrogen,\r\none-tenth normal acid is recommended. In titrating mineral acids\r\nagainst ammonia solutions, use cochineal as indicator.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Sulfuric acid_, specific gravity 1.84, free of nitrates and\r\nalso of ammonium sulfate, which is sometimes added in the process of\r\nmanufacture to destroy nitrogen oxids:\r\n\r\n(2) _Standard alkali_, the strength of which, relative to the acid, has\r\nbeen accurately determined. One-tenth normal ammonia solution, _i. e._,\r\ncontaining 1.7051 grams of ammonia to the liter, is recommended for\r\naccurate work:\r\n\r\n(3) _Metallic mercury_ or mercuric oxid, prepared in the wet way: That\r\nprepared from mercuric nitrate can not be safely used.\r\n\r\n(4) _Potassium permanganate_ finely pulverized:\r\n\r\n(5) _Granulated zinc_, pumice stone, or one-half gram of zinc dust is\r\nto be added to the contents of the flasks in distillation, when found\r\nnecessary, in order to prevent bumping:\r\n\r\n(6) _Potassium sulfid._—A solution of forty grams of commercial\r\npotassium sulfid in one liter of water:\r\n\r\n(7) _Soda._—A saturated solution of sodium hydroxid free of nitrates:\r\n\r\n(8) _Indicator._—Solution of cochineal prepared as follows: Tincture\r\nof cochineal is prepared by digesting for a day or two, at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, and frequently agitating, three grams of pulverized\r\ncochineal in a mixture of fifty cubic centimeters of strong alcohol\r\nwith 200 cubic centimeters of distilled water. The solution is decanted\r\nor filtered through Swedish paper.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus._—(1) _Kjeldahl digestion flasks_ of hard, moderately thick,\r\nwell-annealed glass: These flasks are about twenty-two centimeters\r\nlong, with a round, pear-shaped bottom, having a maximum diameter of\r\nsix centimeters and tapering out gradually in a long neck, which is two\r\ncentimeters in diameter at the narrowest part, and flared a little at\r\nthe edge. The total capacity is from 225 to 250 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n(2) _Distillation flasks_ of ordinary shape, of 550 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity, or preferably flasks of well-annealed glass, of the same\r\ncapacity, of pear-shaped bottom, for both digestion and distillation,\r\nfitted with a rubber stopper and a bulb-tube above to prevent the\r\npossibility of sodium hydroxid being carried over mechanically during\r\ndistillation: The bulbs are about three centimeters in diameter, the\r\ntubes being of the same diameter as the condenser and cut off obliquely\r\nat the lower end. This is adjusted to the tube of the condenser by a\r\nrubber tube.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—(1) _The Digestion._—From seven-tenths to three and\r\nfive-tenths grams of the substance to be analyzed, according to its\r\nproportion of nitrogen, are brought into a digestion flask with\r\napproximately seven-tenths gram of mercuric oxid or its equivalent\r\nin metallic mercury and twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid.\r\nThe flask is placed in an inclined position, and heated below the\r\nboiling-point of the acid for from five to fifteen minutes or until\r\nfrothing has ceased. If the mixture froth badly, a small piece of\r\nparaffin may be added to prevent it. The heat is then raised until the\r\nacid boils briskly. No further attention is required until the contents\r\nof the flask have become a clear liquid, which is colorless or at least\r\nhas only a very pale straw color. The flask is then removed from the\r\nframe, held upright, and while still hot, potassium permanganate is\r\ndropped in carefully and in small quantities at a time until, after\r\nshaking, the liquid remains of a green or purple color.\r\n\r\n(2) _The distillation._—After cooling, the contents of the flask are\r\ntransferred to the distilling flask with about 200 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, a few pieces of granulated zinc, pumice stone, or one-half gram\r\nof zinc dust when found necessary to keep the contents of the flask\r\nfrom bumping, and twenty-five cubic centimeters of potassium sulfid\r\nsolution are added, shaking the flask to mix its contents. Next add\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of the soda solution, or sufficient to make the\r\nreaction strongly alkaline, pouring it down the sides of the flask so\r\nthat it does not mix at once with the acid solution. Connect the flask\r\nwith the condenser, mix the contents by shaking, and distil until all\r\nammonia has passed over into the standard acid. The first 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the distillate will generally contain all the ammonia.\r\nThis operation usually requires from forty minutes to one hour and a\r\nhalf. The distillate is then titrated with standard alkali.\r\n\r\nThe use of mercuric oxid in this operation greatly shortens the time\r\nnecessary for digestion, which is rarely over an hour and a half in\r\ncase of substances most difficult to oxidize, and is more commonly\r\nless than an hour. In most cases the use of potassium permanganate is\r\nquite unnecessary, but it is believed that in exceptional cases it is\r\nrequired for complete oxidation, and in view of the uncertainty it is\r\nalways used. The potassium sulfid removes all the mercury from the\r\nsolution, and so prevents the formation of mercurammonium compounds\r\nwhich are not completely decomposed by soda solution. The addition\r\nof zinc gives rise to an evolution of hydrogen and prevents violent\r\nbumping. Previous to use, the reagents should be tested by a blank\r\nexperiment with sugar, which will partially reduce any nitrates that\r\nare present, which might otherwise escape notice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13. DISTILLING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n=185. The Distillation Apparatus in Use in the Laboratory of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.=—In this laboratory the distilling apparatus\r\nis arranged as shown in Figure 13. The flasks are the same as are\r\nused in the digestion. They are connected to the block tin condensers\r\nby the bulb and rubber tubes, shown hanging on the projecting ends\r\nof the block tin condensers on the right and left of the figure. The\r\ncondensers are contained in a trough through which cold water flows\r\nduring the distillation. The bulb above the flask carries an emergent\r\ntube which extends to near the center of the bulb and is bent laterally\r\nto avoid any danger of carrying over any alkali that may be projected\r\ninto the bulb during boiling. The boiling is continued usually for\r\nnearly an hour or until bumping begins. The table on which the\r\napparatus is placed is so arranged as to permit of easy access on all\r\nsides. The standard acid is held in erlenmeyers placed on wooden blocks\r\nso that the end of the condenser which is a drawn-out glass tube, dips\r\nbeneath the surface of the acid.\r\n\r\n=186. Patrick’s Distilling Flask.=—To avoid the expense and annoyance\r\nattending the breaking of the distilling flasks Patrick has proposed to\r\nmake them of copper.[154] The size, about half a liter, made for the\r\nevolution of oxygen for experimental purposes, may be used. A little\r\nexcess of potassium sulfid is used to make up for any of it which\r\nmight be consumed by the copper. About twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof this solution are recommended. No zinc or pumice stone is required\r\nto prevent bumping and the distillation may be finished within thirty\r\nminutes, thus securing a saving of time. There will doubtless be a\r\nslight corrosion of the flasks by the sulfid employed but where the\r\ngunning oxidation process is practiced this danger would be avoided.\r\n\r\n=187. Modifications of the Kjeldahl Process.=—It would be impracticable\r\nhere to give even a summary of the many unimportant changes which\r\nthe moist combustion process has undergone since the first papers of\r\nits author were published. These changes may be divided into three\r\nclasses; _viz._, 1. Those changes which refer solely to the quantities\r\nof substance taken for analysis, to the composition of the acid\r\nmixture, to the duration of the digestion, to the form and size of\r\nthe flasks, both for digestion and distillation, and to the manner of\r\ndistillation and of titration. For references to the papers on these\r\nsubjects the reader may consult the periodic journals.[155] The most\r\nimportant of these minor changes are the following: Instead of the\r\ntitration by means of separated iodin most chemists have had recourse\r\nto the simpler method of direct titration of the excess of acid by a\r\nset solution of an alkali. Barium, sodium, and potassium hydroxids are\r\nthe alkaline solutions most employed. This process permits of a larger\r\nquantity of the sample being taken for combustion and of the use of a\r\nlarger quantity of acid in the receiver. It also implies the use of\r\na larger digestion flask. In fact it is now quite common to make the\r\ndigestion in a special glass flask large enough to be used also for the\r\ndistillation. This saves one transfer of the material with the possible\r\ndanger of loss attending it.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation it is a common practice, especially in Germany, to\r\ndo away with the condensing worm and to carry a long glass tube from\r\nthe distilling flask directly into the acid on the receiver. The only\r\ninconvenience in this method is the heating of the contents of the\r\nreceiving flask, but this is attended with no danger of loss of ammonia\r\nand the distillate, on account of the high temperature it acquires, is\r\nleft free of carbon dioxid. Many of these minor changes have tended to\r\nsimplify the process, but without affecting the principle of the method\r\nin the least.\r\n\r\n2. In the second place a class of changes may be mentioned in which\r\nthere is a marked difference in the method of effecting the oxidation\r\nsecured by the introduction of a substance, usually a metal, during\r\nthe digestion for the purpose of accelerating the oxidation. In\r\nthe original process the only aid to oxidation was applied at the\r\nend of the digestion in the use of potassium permanganate. In the\r\nmodifications now under consideration a metallic oxid or metal is\r\napplied at the beginning of the digestion. Copper and mercury are the\r\nmetals usually employed. A separate paragraph will be given to the\r\ndescription of this modification known as the process of Wilfarth.\r\n\r\n3. The third class of changes is even more radical in its nature,\r\nhaving for its object the adaptation of the moist combustion method\r\nto oxidized or mineral nitrogen. The chief feature of this class\r\nof changes consists in the introduction of a substance rich in\r\nhydrocarbons, and capable of easily forming nitro compounds, for the\r\npurpose of holding the oxids of nitrogen which are formed during the\r\ncombustion and helping finally to reduce them to the form of ammonia.\r\nThe chief varieties of this class of changes were proposed by Asboth,\r\nJodlbaur, and Scovell, and will be fully set forth in separate\r\nparagraphs.\r\n\r\n=188. Method of Wilfarth.=—The basis of this modification as already\r\nnoted rests on the fact that certain metallic oxids have the power\r\nof carrying oxygen, and thus assisting in a katalytic way in the\r\ncombustion of organic matter.[156] The copper and mercury oxids\r\nare best adapted for this purpose and experience has shown that\r\nmercuric oxid, or even metallic mercury gives the best results. The\r\nmanipulation is carried out as follows: From one to three grams of\r\nthe sample, according to its richness in nitrogen, are heated with\r\na mixture of twenty cubic centimeters of acid containing two-fifths\r\nfuming and three-fifths ordinary sulfuric acid. To this is added\r\nabout seven-tenths gram of mercuric oxid prepared in the wet way from\r\na mercury salt free of nitrogen. The combustion takes place in the\r\nusual kjeldahl flask. If the boiling be continued until the liquid\r\nis entirely colorless, final oxidation with potassium permanganate\r\nis unnecessary. To save time the combustion may be stopped when a\r\nlight amber color is reached, and then the oxidation finished with\r\npermanganate. Before distilling, a sufficient quantity of potassium\r\nsulfid is added to precipitate all the mercury as sulfid and thus\r\nprevent the formation of mercurammonium compounds which would produce\r\na deficit of ammonia. A convenient strength of the sulfid solution is\r\nobtained by dissolving forty grams of potassium sulfid in one liter of\r\nwater. Bumping at the end of the distillation is not usual, especially\r\nif potash-lye be used, but should it occur it may be stopped by the\r\naddition of zinc dust.\r\n\r\nOnly when a large excess of potassium sulfid is used is there an\r\nevolution of hydrogen sulfid, the presence of which, however, does not\r\ninfluence the accuracy of the results.\r\n\r\nThe presence of mercuric sulfid in the solution tends to prevent\r\nbumping during the distillation, but it is advisable, nevertheless,\r\nto use a little zinc dust. Other minor modifications consist of\r\nforming the acid mixture with equal volumes of concentrated and\r\nfuming sulfuric acid containing in one liter 100 grams of phosphoric\r\nacid anhydrid,[157] and using metallic mercury instead of mercuric\r\noxid; or a mixture of half a gram of copper sulfate and one gram of\r\nmetallic mercury,[158] or half a gram of copper oxid and a few drops of\r\nplatinic chlorid solution containing 0.04 gram of platinum in a cubic\r\ncentimeter.[159]\r\n\r\n=189. Modification of Asboth.=—In order to adapt the moist combustion\r\nprocess to nitric nitrogen Asboth proposed the use of benzoic\r\nacid.[160] For half a gram of saltpeter 1.75 grams of benzoic acid\r\nshould be used. At the end of the combustion the residual benzoic\r\nacid is oxidized by means of potassium permanganate with a subsequent\r\nreheating. If the nitrogen be present as an oxid or as cyanid, one gram\r\nof sugar is added. The metallic element added is half a gram of copper\r\noxid. Asboth also recommends that the soda-lye used in the distillation\r\nbe mixed with sodium potassium tartrate for the purpose of holding the\r\ncopper and manganese oxids in solution and thus preventing bumping. The\r\nalkaline liquor contains in one liter 350 grams of the double tartrate\r\nand 300 grams of sodium hydroxid.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the use of benzoic acid rests is found in the\r\nfact that it easily yields nitro-compounds and thus prevents the loss\r\nof the nitrogen oxids, these readily combining with the benzoic acid.\r\nThe nitro-compounds can be subsequently converted into ammonia by\r\ntreatment with potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\nThe pyridin and chinolin groups of bodies do not yield all their\r\nnitrogen as ammonia by the above treatment.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions drawn by Asboth from the analytical data obtained were:\r\n\r\n(1) Sugar should be used in the ordinary kjeldahl process in those\r\ncases where the nitrogen in the organic substance is present as oxids\r\nor as cyanogen.\r\n\r\n(2) In the case of nitrates good results may be secured with benzoic\r\nacid but permanganate must be added at the end.\r\n\r\n(3) The kjeldahl-wilfarth process can be applied with substances\r\ndifficultly decomposed, _e. g._, alkaloidal bodies.\r\n\r\n=190. Variation of Jodlbaur.=—The benzoic acid method, although a step\r\nforward, is not entirely satisfactory in the treatment of nitrates by\r\nmoist combustion. Jodlbaur has proposed to substitute for the benzoic,\r\nphenolsulfuric acid.[161]\r\n\r\nFrom two to five-tenths gram of a nitrate are treated with twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric and two and a half of\r\nphenolsulfuric acid, together with three grams of zinc dust and five\r\ndrops of a solution of platinic chlorid of the strength mentioned\r\nabove. The phenolsulfuric acid is prepared by dissolving fifty grams of\r\nphenol in 100 cubic centimeters of strong sulfuric acid. The combustion\r\nis continued until the solution is colorless, which may take as much as\r\nfive hours. If phosphoric acid anhydrid be used as recommended above,\r\nthe time of the combustion may be diminished by one-half, but in such\r\na case the glass of the combustion flask is strongly attacked and is\r\nquite likely to break.\r\n\r\nWith substances very rich in nitrates it is advisable to rub them first\r\nwith dry gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the process rests on the fact that by a careful\r\nadmixture of a nitrogenous substance diluted with land plaster, with\r\nphenolsulfuric acid, it is possible to change the nitric acid into\r\nnitro-phenol, and by the reducing action of zinc dust to change the\r\nnitro-product formed into amido-phenol. This afterwards is transformed\r\ninto ammonium sulfate by heating with sulfuric acid, by which process,\r\nat the same time, all other nitrogenous compounds present in the\r\nsubstance, as with Kjeldahl’s method, likewise form ammonium sulfate,\r\nonly with the difference that addition of mercury is here absolutely\r\nnecessary for the complete transformation of the slowly decomposed\r\namido-phenol which again brings about the necessity of decomposing\r\nthe nitrogenous mercury compounds formed in the solution by potassium\r\nsulfid, which is added after or with the soda-lye.\r\n\r\n=191. The Dutch Jodlbaur Method.=—The Royal Experiment Station of\r\nHolland directs that the jodlbaur process be carried out as indicated\r\nbelow.[162]\r\n\r\nThe reagents necessary are:\r\n\r\n1. _Phenolsulfuric acid_, prepared by dissolving 100 grams of pure\r\ncrystallized phenol in pure sulfuric acid (1.84) and making up the\r\nsolution to a liter with the same sulfuric acid:\r\n\r\n2. _Zinc_, carefully washed and thoroughly dried:\r\n\r\n3. _Sodium hydroxid solution_, the same as is used in the kjeldahl\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\n4. _Potassium sulfid solution_, made by dissolving 355 grams of\r\npotassium sulfid (K₂S), or sodium sulfid solution, made by dissolving\r\n250 grams of sodium sulfid (Na₂S) in a liter of water.\r\n\r\nAs apparatus, are necessary oxidation flasks holding about 200\r\ncubic centimeters, and distillation flasks holding about 750 cubic\r\ncentimeters, both of bohemian glass.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—Weigh one gram of substance, moisten it with water,\r\ndry, and introduce into an oxidation flask. Cover with fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of phenolsulfuric acid and, after cooling, thoroughly mix\r\nby gently shaking. After five minutes add from two to three grams of\r\nzinc in small proportions, keeping the flask cool, then twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of sulfuric acid, and finally two drops of mercury. Boil\r\nthe mixture till the fluid is colorless. Cool and dilute. Wash into\r\na distillation flask and add an excess of sodium hydroxid solution\r\nand twenty-five cubic centimeters of the sodium (or potassium) sulfid\r\nsolution. Distil and titrate as in the kjeldahl method.\r\n\r\n=192. The Halle-Jodlbaur Method.=—At the Halle station it is\r\nthe uniform practice to mix the nitrate with gypsum before the\r\ncombustion.[163] In the case of Chile phosphates ten grams are rubbed\r\nwith an equal amount of gypsum, and two grams of the mixture, equal\r\nto one gram of the nitrate, taken for the determination. In the case\r\nof saltpeter mixtures which contain over eight per cent of nitrogen,\r\none gram of the mixture with gypsum is taken, of guanos one and a half\r\ngrams, and of lower forms of nitrates or mixtures thereof, from three\r\nto five grams.\r\n\r\nThe sample, as prepared above, is treated with thirty cubic centimeters\r\nof a mixture of phenolsulfuric acid and phosphoric acid anhydrid.\r\nThe mixture is prepared by dissolving sixty-six grams of phenol and\r\n250 grams of phosphoric anhydrid in strong sulfuric acid, and, after\r\ncooling, mixing the two solutions and making the volume up to 1,650\r\ncubic centimeters with pure sulfuric acid. The mixture contains, in\r\nthirty cubic centimeters, one and two-tenths grams of phenol and four\r\ngrams of phosphoric anhydrid. In the use of phenolsulfuric acid the\r\nthe presence of phosphoric anhydrid is indispensable in keeping the\r\nsulfuric acid water-free and in absorbing the water produced by the\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nThe phenolsulfuric acid used contains only enough phenol to reduce half\r\na gram of saltpeter.\r\n\r\nThe sample and acid mixture having been put in the combustion flask the\r\nlatter is shaken, at intervals, for an hour, and the contents cooled.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the nitrates into nitro-phenol compounds is finished\r\nin this time, and the next step consists in reducing these bodies to\r\nthe amido-phenol group. This is accomplished in the cold by nascent\r\nhydrogen produced by the addition of zinc dust to the mixture. From one\r\nto three grams of the dust are to be used in proportion to the quantity\r\nof nitrates originally present.\r\n\r\nThe flask should be placed in a cooling mixture and the zinc dust added\r\nin small portions to prevent a too violent evolution of hydrogen.\r\nAfter the reduction is ended the flask is allowed to stand for two\r\nhours, after which the combustion, distillation, and titration are\r\naccomplished in the usual way. On cooling, after the end of the\r\ncombustion, the contents of the flask become solid. They may be brought\r\nagain into liquid state by shaking and gentle warming.\r\n\r\n=193. The Official Kjeldahl Method for Nitric Nitrogen.=—As has already\r\nbeen stated, the presence of certain organic compounds, rich in\r\nhydrocarbons, permits the reduction of nitric nitrogen to ammonia by\r\ncombustion with sulfuric acid. Benzol, phenol, and salicylic acid have\r\nall been used for this purpose. The official chemists have adopted for\r\ntheir method the salicylic acid process first proposed by Scovell.[164]\r\n\r\nBesides the reagents and apparatus given under the Kjeldahl method\r\nthere will be needed:\r\n\r\n(1) _Zinc dust_: This should be an impalpable powder; granulated zinc\r\nor zinc filings will not answer.\r\n\r\n(2) _Sodium thiosulfate_:\r\n\r\n(3) _Commercial salicylic acid_:\r\n\r\nIt is found most convenient to prepare a solution of 33.3 grams of\r\nsalicylic acid in one liter of the strongest sulfuric acid, and keep\r\nit for use rather than to mix it for each combustion. We prefer the\r\nthiosulfate process first mentioned below. In the zinc dust method\r\nthere has been noticed a tendency for the distillation flask to break\r\njust at the end of the process.\r\n\r\n_The Manipulation._—Place from seven-tenths to three and five-tenths\r\ngrams of the substance to be analyzed in a kjeldahl digesting flask,\r\nadd sixty cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid containing one gram of\r\nsalicylic acid, and shake until thoroughly mixed, then add five grams\r\nof crystallized sodium thiosulfate; or add to the substance thirty\r\ncubic centimeters of sulfuric acid containing two grams of salicylic\r\nacid, then add gradually two grams of zinc dust, shaking the contents\r\nof the flask at the same time. Finally place the flask on the stand\r\nfor holding the digestion flasks, where it is heated over a low flame\r\nuntil all danger from frothing has passed. The heat is then raised\r\nuntil the acid boils briskly and the boiling continued until white\r\nfumes no longer pour out of the flask. This requires about five or ten\r\nminutes. Add now approximately seven-tenths gram of mercuric oxid or\r\nits equivalent in metallic mercury, and continue the boiling until the\r\nliquid in the flask is colorless or nearly so. In case the contents of\r\nthe flask are likely to become solid before this point is reached add\r\nten cubic centimeters more of sulfuric acid. Complete the oxidation\r\nwith a little potassium permanganate in the usual way, and proceed with\r\nthe distillation as described in the kjeldahl method. The reagents\r\nshould be tested by blank experiments.\r\n\r\n=194. The Gunning Moist Combustion Process.=—The modification proposed\r\nby Gunning was based upon the observation that in the ordinary kjeldahl\r\nprocess the excess of sulfur trioxid in the beginning of the operation\r\nsoon escapes or unites with water in a form not easily decomposed.[165]\r\nDuring the progress of the combustion the acid diminishes in strength\r\nuntil it is below the concentration represented by the formula H₂SO₄,\r\nand in this diluted condition the oxidation takes place more slowly.\r\nGunning proposes to avoid this difficulty by mixing potassium sulfate\r\nwith the sulfuric acid. This salt forms with the sulfuric acid, acid\r\nsalts which, by heating, lose water easier than acid and as is well\r\nknown, they not only act as decomposing and oxidizing media as well as\r\nsulfuric acid, but even in a higher degree, resembling the action of\r\nsulfuric acid at high temperatures and under pressure.\r\n\r\nBy heating this mixture of sulfuric acid and potassium sulfate with\r\norganic matters in an open vessel, not only the water originally\r\npresent, but that which is formed during the oxidation is driven off\r\nwithout loss of acid. For this reason instead of the oxidizing mixture\r\nbecoming weaker, the acid becomes stronger, the boiling-point rises and\r\nthis, combined with the fluidity of the mass favors the decomposition\r\nand oxidation of the organic matter in a constantly increasing ratio.\r\n\r\nThe original mixture used by Gunning had the following composition;\r\n_viz._, one part of potassium sulfate and two parts of strong sulfuric\r\nacid. The substances are united by heat and, on cooling, are in a\r\nsemi-solid state, melting, however, easily on the application of heat\r\nand assuming a condition to be easily poured from vessel to vessel.\r\nThe quantity of the sample taken should vary in proportion to its\r\nnitrogenous content from half a gram to a gram. The combustion takes\r\nplace in flasks entirely similar to those used in the ordinary kjeldahl\r\nprocess. In the case of liquids, they should be previously evaporated\r\nto dryness before the addition of the oxidizing mixture. At the\r\nbeginning of the combustion there is a violent foaming attended with\r\nevolution of some acid and much water, and afterwards of stronger acid.\r\nThis loss of acid should not be allowed to go far enough to produce\r\ntoo great concentration of the material in the flask. One of the best\r\nways to avoid it is to place a funnel in the flask covered with a\r\nwatch-glass which will permit of the condensation and return of the\r\nescaping acid. As soon as the foaming ceases, the flame should be so\r\nregulated as to permit of the volatilized acid being condensed upon the\r\nsides of the flask. In the end a colorless mass is obtained in which no\r\nmetallic oxids are present, and this mass can at once be diluted with\r\nwater, treated with alkali, and distilled. According to the nature of\r\nthe substance from half an hour to an hour and a half are required for\r\nthe complete combustion.\r\n\r\n_Modifications of the Gunning Method._—As in the case of the kjeldahl\r\nmethod, numerous minor modifications of the gunning method have\r\nbeen made, the most important of which relate to its application to\r\nsubstances containing nitrates. In general the same processes are\r\nemployed in this case as with the kjeldahl method. One of the best\r\nmodifications consists in the use of the mixture of salicylic and\r\nsulfuric acids followed by the addition of sodium thiosulfate or of\r\npotassium sulfate or sulfid. These modifications will be given in\r\ndetail under the official methods.\r\n\r\n=195. Reactions of the Gunning Process.=—The various reactions which\r\ntake place during the combustion according to the gunning method have\r\nbeen tabulated by Van Slyke.[166]\r\n\r\nThe first reaction to take place is the union of sulfuric acid and\r\npotassium sulfate to form potassium acid sulfate in accordance with the\r\nfollowing equation:\r\n\r\n    (1) K₂SO₄ + H₂SO₄ = 2KHSO₄.\r\n\r\nWhen heated, the potassium acid sulfate decomposes, forming potassium\r\ndisulfate and water, thus:\r\n\r\n    (2) 2KHSO₄ = K₂S₂O₇ + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe potassium disulfate at a higher temperature decomposes, forming\r\nnormal potassium sulfate and sulfur trioxid, thus:\r\n\r\n    (3) K₂S₂O₇ = K₂SO₄ + SO₃.\r\n\r\nAt a sufficiently high temperature the two preceding reactions may take\r\nplace in one, thus:\r\n\r\n    2KHSO₄ = K₂SO₄ + H₂O + SO₃.\r\n\r\nAt the temperature at which these reactions take place, the water\r\nthat is set free does not recombine with the sulfur trioxid nor with\r\nthe sulfuric acid that is present in excess, but is expelled from\r\nthe mixture; hence the mixture becomes more concentrated during the\r\ndigestion. The sulfur trioxid set free acts upon the organic matter in\r\nthe powerful manner peculiar to it, and the potassium sulfate formed\r\nin the last reaction above unites with another molecule of sulfuric\r\nacid, and the same round of reactions is repeated continuously so long\r\nas there is an excess of free sulfuric acid present in the mixture.\r\nAs the liquid becomes more concentrated with the continuation of the\r\ndigestion, the boiling-point increases so that the effect is the same\r\nas heating under pressure. The danger of too great concentration and\r\nrisk of consequent loss of nitrogen is avoided by using increased\r\nproportions of sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the kjeldahl the gunning method presents the following\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n(1) The gunning method requires fewer reagents. As no form of mercury\r\nis used no potassium sulfid is needed, and there is no risk of loss\r\nfrom the presence of mercurammonium compounds.\r\n\r\n(2) The solution to which caustic soda is added is clear, so that in\r\nneutralizing, it is an easy matter to avoid great excess of alkali, and\r\nso, in most cases, to avoid foaming and bumping in distillation.\r\n\r\n(3) In the blank determinations less nitrogen is found in the reagents\r\nused in the gunning method. In only one case was more nitrogen reported\r\nin a blank by this method; in all the others the amount averaged\r\nconsiderably less.\r\n\r\n=196. The Official Gunning Method.=—In a digestion flask holding\r\nfrom 250 to 500 cubic centimeters place from seven-tenths to two and\r\neight-tenths grams of the substance to be analyzed, according to its\r\nproportion of nitrogen. Then add ten grams of powdered potassium\r\nsulfate and from fifteen to twenty-five cubic centimeters (ordinarily\r\nabout twenty cubic centimeters) of concentrated sulfuric acid. Conduct\r\nthe digestion as in the kjeldahl process, starting with a temperature\r\nbelow boiling-point and increasing the heat gradually until frothing\r\nceases. Digest until colorless or nearly so. Do not add either\r\npotassium permanganate or potassium sulfid. Dilute, neutralize, and\r\ndistil as in the kjeldahl method. In neutralizing, it is convenient\r\nto add a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator, by which one can\r\ntell when the acid is completely neutralized, remembering that the\r\npink color, which indicates an alkaline reaction, is destroyed by\r\na considerable excess of strong fixed alkali. The distillation and\r\ntitration are conducted as in the kjeldahl method. In distilling,\r\nthe use of zinc or of any substance to prevent bumping or foaming\r\nis generally unnecessary, if too great an excess of fixed alkali be\r\navoided. The amount of sulfuric acid recommended by Gunning is two\r\ngrams for each gram of potassium sulfate; but Voorhees has found that\r\nthis mixture is so viscous as to cause troublesome foaming frequently,\r\nand after cooling it cakes in a hard mass, which may be difficult\r\nto redissolve.[167] To avoid foaming and caking, he has found it an\r\neffective means to increase the amount of sulfuric acid used, taking\r\ninstead of two grams to one of potassium sulfate three or four grams\r\nof acid to one of potassium sulfate. It is, therefore, suggested\r\nin carrying out the work, to use from five to twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters (ordinarily about twenty cubic centimeters) of sulfuric\r\nacid for ten grams of potassium sulfate. In case the potassium sulfate\r\nis not free from nitrogen compounds, one or two recrystallizations will\r\nmake it pure.\r\n\r\n=197. Gunning Method Adapted to Nitrates.=—The essential features\r\nof this modification are due to Winton and Voorhees.[168] The\r\nmodifications of the kjeldahl method, for similar purposes, furnished\r\nthe material details for the gunning modified process. Winton reports\r\ngood results from digesting for two hours, from half a gram to a gram\r\nof the sample with thirty cubic centimeters of sulfuric containing\r\ntwo grams of salicylic acid, in a flask of half a liter capacity. Two\r\ngrams of zinc dust are then slowly added, with constant shaking, and\r\nthe flask heated, at first gently, until, after a few minutes boiling,\r\ndense fumes are no longer emitted. Three grams of potassium sulfate are\r\nnext added and the boiling continued until the solution is colorless,\r\nor if iron be present, until a light straw color is produced. On\r\ncooling, when the mixture begins to solidify, water is added with\r\ncaution, and afterwards sodium hydroxid, and the ammonia is obtained by\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nIn the process, as conducted by Voorhees, about one gram of the sample\r\nis digested with ten grams of potassium sulfate and thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of sulfuric containing one gram of salicylic acid, and\r\nthree grains of zinc sulfid. The heat is kept down until frothing\r\nceases, and then the mass kept in gentle ebullition until clear. The\r\ndistillation is accomplished with the usual precautions. The voorhees\r\nprocess is superior to that recommended by Winton in adding the\r\npotassium sulfate at the beginning of the combustion.\r\n\r\n=198. Official Gunning Method Modified to Include the Nitrogen\r\nof Nitrates.=—In a digestion flask holding from 250 to 500 cubic\r\ncentimeters, place from seven-tenths to three and five-tenths grams\r\nof the substance to be analyzed, according to the amount of nitrogen\r\npresent. Add from thirty to thirty-five cubic centimeters of salicylic\r\nacid mixture, namely, thirty cubic centimeters of sulfuric to one gram\r\nof salicylic acid, shake until thoroughly mixed, and allow to stand\r\nfrom five to ten minutes, with frequent shaking; then add five grams of\r\nsodium thiosulfate and ten grams of potassium sulfate. Heat very gently\r\nuntil frothing ceases, then strongly until nearly colorless. Dilute,\r\nneutralize, and distil the same as in the gunning method.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF NITROGEN IN DEFINITE FORMS OF COMBINATION.\r\n\r\n=199. Introductory Considerations.=—In the foregoing pages has been\r\ngiven a summary of the methods most in vogue for the estimation of\r\nnitrogen in fertilizers and fertilizing materials. There are many\r\ncases in which the analyst may have to deal with a definite chemical\r\ncompound, and where a modified or shorter method may be used. There\r\nare other cases in which the nitrogen may be present in two or three\r\ndefinite forms, as in artificially mixed fertilizers, and where it\r\nis desirable to show the proportions in which the various forms are\r\npresent. For these reasons it is necessary to be able to use methods by\r\nwhich the percentage of nitrogen in its various forms may be relatively\r\nas well as absolutely determined. Such a case would be presented for\r\ninstance, in that of a fertilizer containing dried blood, sodium\r\nnitrate, and ammonium sulfate. It is evident here that the total\r\nnitrogen could be determined by the volumetric method by combustion\r\nwith copper oxid, or by the moist combustion process adapted to\r\nnitric nitrogen, but the method of determining the percentage of each\r\nconstituent has not yet been described.\r\n\r\nWe have to deal here with a case entirely similar to that of phosphoric\r\nacid in a superphosphate. There is no doubt whatever of the uneven\r\nassimilability of the different forms of nitrogen. A nitrate, for\r\ninstance, is already in condition for assimilation by plants. An\r\nammoniacal salt is only partly changed to a state suited to plant\r\nnutrition while organic nitrogen is forced to undergo a complete\r\ntransformation before it becomes available to supply the needs of the\r\ngrowing plant. It is important, therefore, equally to the analyst,\r\nthe merchant, and the agronomist, to know definitely the forms of\r\ncombination in which the nitrogen exists and the relative proportion of\r\nthe different combinations.\r\n\r\n=200. Nitrogen as Ammonia.=—The most frequent form in which nitrogen\r\nas ammonia is used for fertilizing is as sulfate. The method of\r\ndetermination to be described is, however, equally applicable to all\r\nammonia salts. When no other form of nitrogenous compound is present\r\nthe ammonia can be easily and directly determined by distillation\r\nwith soda- or potash-lye, as described in the final part of the moist\r\ncombustion process.\r\n\r\nTo one gram of the ammonia salt add from 200 to 300 cubic centimeters\r\nof water and thirty grams of the soda-lye used in the moist combustion\r\nprocess; distil, collect the ammonia, and titrate the excess of\r\nsulfuric acid exactly as there described.\r\n\r\nFresenius recommends that the ammonia expelled by distillation be taken\r\nup by one-fifth normal sulfuric acid, the excess of which is titrated\r\nwith one-fifth normal soda, using phenolphthalein as an indicator.\r\nIf the distillate, on examination, be found to contain thiocyanate,\r\nsoda-lye cannot be used for the expulsion of ammonia, but, in its\r\nplace, caustic magnesia is applied.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where organic matter containing nitrogen is present,\r\ncaustic magnesia must be substituted for the soda solution. The\r\nmagnesia must be added in sufficient excess and the distillation\r\ncontinued a little longer than is necessary when soda-lye is used.\r\nOtherwise the details of the operation are the same.\r\n\r\nIn a mixed fertilizer containing organic nitrogen and ammonia salts,\r\nthe total nitrogen can be determined by the moist combustion process,\r\nand the ammoniacal nitrogen by distillation with magnesia. The\r\ndifference between the two results will give the nitrogen due to the\r\norganic matter.\r\n\r\nTo avoid any danger whatever of decomposing organic nitrogenous\r\ncompounds, the ammonia may be determined in the cold by treatment with\r\nsoda-lye, under a bell-jar containing some set sulfuric acid. The\r\noperation must be allowed to continue for many days. Even at the end\r\nof a long time it will be found that some ammonia is still escaping.\r\nIt may therefore be finally inferred that all the nitrogen as ammonia\r\nis not obtained by this process, or that even magnesia may gradually\r\nconvert other nitrogenous compounds into ammonia. In this connection\r\nthe methods of determining ammonia in soils =406, 407=, and =408= of\r\nvolume one may be consulted.\r\n\r\n=201. Method of Boussingault.=—The official French method is\r\nessentially the original method of Boussingault with slight\r\nmodifications. It is conducted as follows:[169] In case the sample is\r\nammonium sulfate about half a gram is placed in a flask of half a liter\r\ncapacity, together with 300 cubic centimeters of distilled water and\r\ntwo grams of caustic magnesia. The flask is connected with a condenser\r\nof glass or metal which ends in a tube drawn out to a point and dipping\r\nbeneath the set acid in the receiver in the usual way. The acid is\r\ncolored with litmus or lacmoid tincture. The distillation is continued\r\nuntil about 100 cubic centimeters have gone over. The receiver is then\r\nremoved with the usual precautions and the residual acid titrated.\r\nSuppose twenty cubic centimeters of normal acid have been employed and\r\ntwelve and a half cubic centimeters of normal alkali be necessary to\r\nneutralize the excess of the acid. Then the nitrogen is found by the\r\nfollowing equations: 20.0 - 12.5 = 7.5 and 7.5 × 0.014 = 0.105 gram =\r\nweight of nitrogen found. Then 0.105 × 100 ÷ 5 = 21.00 = per cent of\r\nnitrogen found.\r\n\r\nThe distilling apparatus of Aubin is preferred by the French chemists,\r\nan apparatus so arranged with a reflux partial condenser, that nearly\r\nall the aqueous vapor is returned in a condensed state to the flask\r\nwhile the ammonia, on account of its great volatility, is carried\r\nover into the receiver. To avoid the regurgitation which might be\r\ncaused by the concentrated ammonia gas coming in contact with the acid\r\nthe separable part of the condensing tube is expanded into a bulb\r\nlarge enough to hold all the acid which lies above its mouth. By the\r\nmeans of this apparatus the ammonia is all collected in the standard\r\nacid without greatly increasing its volume and the titration is thus\r\nrendered sharper. The employment of caustic magnesia has the advantage\r\nof not decomposing any organic matters or cyanids that may be present.\r\n\r\nIf the sample under examination hold part of its ammonia as ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate it will be necessary first to treat it with\r\nsulfuric acid in order to set the ammonia free and then to use enough\r\nof the magnesium oxid to neutralize the excess of the sulfuric acid and\r\nstill supply the two grams necessary for the distillation. When the\r\nsample contains a considerable quantity of organic matter it sometimes\r\ntends to become frothy towards the end of the distillation. This\r\ntrouble can be avoided by introducing into the flask one or two grams\r\nof paraffin.\r\n\r\nWhere carbon dioxid is given off during the distillation the contents\r\nof the receiver must be boiled before titration, or else lacmoid must\r\nbe used as an indicator instead of litmus.\r\n\r\n=202. Determination of Thiocyanates in Ammoniacal Fertilizers.=—The\r\nextended use of ammonium sulfate as a fertilizer renders it important\r\nto determine the actual constituents which may be present in samples\r\nof this material. The following bodies have been found in commercial\r\nammonium sulfates: Sulfuric acid, chlorin, ammonia, thiocyanic acid,\r\npotash, soda, lime and iron oxid. These are found in the soluble\r\nportions. In the insoluble portions have been found silica, sulfuric\r\nacid, lime, magnesia and iron oxid. A sample of commercial ammonium\r\nsulfate analyzed by Jumeau contained the following substances:[170]\r\n\r\n                             Per cent.\r\n    Moisture                  10.5109\r\n    Ammonium sulfate          67.8453\r\n    Ammonium thiocyanate       9.3935\r\n    Sodium sulfate             9.2429\r\n    Potassium sulfate          0.9774\r\n    Calcium sulfate            0.6800\r\n    Iron thiocyanate           0.5000\r\n    Magnesium chlorid          traces\r\n    Silica                     0.0830\r\n    Undetermined               0.7670\r\n\r\nThe determination of the thiocyanic acid in the thiocyanate is\r\ngenerally made by the oxidation of the sulfur to sulfuric acid and its\r\nsubsequent weighing in the form of barium sulfate. Jumeau has modified\r\nthe method by determining the amount of the thiocyanate by means of a\r\ntitrated liquid. The method is practiced as follows:\r\n\r\nA solution of ammonium thiocyanate is prepared, containing eight\r\ngrams of this salt per liter, and its exact content of thiocyanate is\r\nrigorously determined by titration with silver nitrate or by the weight\r\nof the barium sulfate produced after the oxidation of the sulfur.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of the titrated liquor are taken and diluted\r\nwith water to about 100 cubic centimeters and ten cubic centimeters\r\nof pure sulfuric acid added. Afterward, drop by drop, a solution of\r\npotassium permanganate is added, containing about ten grams of that\r\nsalt per liter. The permanganate is instantly decolorized. There is an\r\nevolution of hydrocyanic acid as the thiocyanate passes to the state\r\nof sulfuric acid. A single drop in excess gives to the mixture the\r\nwell-known rose coloration of the permanganate solution which persists\r\nfor several hours. The number of cubic centimeters necessary to produce\r\nthe persistent rose tint is noted and the same operation is carried on\r\nwith from one-half to one gram of the unknown product which is to be\r\nassayed. A simple proportion indicates the content of the thiocyanate\r\nin the unknown body. The process is of great exactitude and permits the\r\nrapid determination of thiocyanic acid in the presence of chlorids,\r\ncyanids, etc., which remain without action upon the permanganate. In\r\ncase chlorids and cyanids are absent the thiocyanate can be determined\r\ndirectly by silver nitrate either by weighing the precipitate or by\r\nthe process of Volhardt based upon the precipitation of the silver by\r\nthiocyanate in the presence of a ferric salt. The end of the reaction\r\nis indicated by the red coloration which the liquid shows when the\r\nthiocyanate is in excess.\r\n\r\n=203. Separation of Albuminoid from Amid and Other Forms of Nitrogen\r\nin Organic Fertilizers.=—It may be of interest to the dealer, farmer,\r\nand analyst, to discriminate between the albuminoid and other nitrogen\r\nin fertilizers, such as oil-cakes. The final value of the nitrogen\r\nfor plant nourishment is not greatly different, but the immediate\r\navailability for nitrification is a matter of some importance. The most\r\nconvenient process in such a case is the copper hydroxid separation\r\nprocess as improved by Stutzer.[171] The process is conveniently\r\ncarried out in accordance with the method prescribed by the official\r\nchemists.[172]\r\n\r\n_Total Crude Protein._—Determine nitrogen as directed for nitrogen in\r\nfertilizers and multiply the result by 6.25 for the crude protein.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Albuminoid Nitrogen._—To from seven-tenths to\r\neight-tenths gram of the substance in a beaker add 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, heat to boiling, or in the case of substances\r\nrich in starch, heat on the water-bath ten minutes, and add a quantity\r\nof cupric hydroxid mixture containing from one-half to six-tenths\r\ngram of the hydroxid; stir thoroughly, filter when cold, wash with\r\ncold water, and put the filter and its contents into the concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid for the determination of nitrogen. The filter-papers used\r\nmust be practically free of nitrogen. Add sufficient potassium sulfid\r\nsolution to completely precipitate all copper and mercury, and proceed\r\nas in the moist combustion process for nitrogen. If the substance\r\nexamined consist of seed of any kind, or residues of seeds, such as\r\noil-cake or anything else rich in alkaline phosphates, add a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of a concentrated solution of alum just before adding the\r\ncupric hydroxid, and mix well by stirring. This serves to decompose\r\nthe alkaline phosphates. If this be not done cupric phosphate and free\r\nalkali may be formed, and the protein-copper may be partially dissolved\r\nin the alkaline liquid.\r\n\r\n_Cupric Hydroxid._—Prepare the cupric hydroxid as follows: Dissolve\r\n100 grams of pure cupric sulfate in five liters of water, and add\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of glycerol; add a dilute solution\r\nof sodium hydroxid until the liquid is alkaline; filter, rub the\r\nprecipitate up with water containing five cubic centimeters of glycerol\r\nper liter, and then wash by decantation or filtration until the\r\nwashings are no longer alkaline. Rub the precipitate up again in a\r\nmortar with water containing ten per cent of glycerol, thus preparing\r\na uniform gelatinous mass that can be measured out with a pipette.\r\nDetermine the quantity of cupric hydroxid per cubic centimeter of this\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n_Amid Nitrogen._—The albuminoid nitrogen determined as above subtracted\r\nfrom the total, gives that part of the organic nitrogen existing in the\r\nsample as amids and in other allied forms.\r\n\r\n=204. Separation of Nitric and Ammoniacal from Organic Nitrogen.=—The\r\nnitrogen being present in three forms, _viz._, organic, ammoniacal,\r\nand nitric, the separation of the latter two may be accomplished by\r\nthe following procedure:[173] One gram of the fertilizer is exhausted\r\non a small filter with a two per cent solution of tannin, using from\r\nthirty to forty cubic centimeters in small portions. This is sufficient\r\nto dissolve all the nitrates and the greater portion of the ammoniacal\r\nsalts, while the tannin renders insoluble all the organic nitrogenous\r\ncompounds. The filter and its contents are treated for nitrogen by the\r\nkjeldahl process. When the distillation and titration are completed\r\nthe solution obtained by the aqueous tannin is added to the distilling\r\nflask and the operation continued. This represents the ammoniacal\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe nitric acid is estimated by the ferrous iron or other appropriate\r\nmethod in another portion of the substance.\r\n\r\nThis method can be used even when the fertilizer contains ammonium\r\nmagnesium phosphate. In this case digest one gram for fifteen hours in\r\ndilute soda-lye solution, which easily dissolves the ammonium magnesium\r\nphosphate. Filter and wash the insoluble part with the tannin solution.\r\nThe residue is treated as above. The filtered solution distilled with\r\nsoda-lye furnishes the ammonia. The nitrates are estimated by one of\r\nthe methods above mentioned.\r\n\r\n=205. Nitric Nitrogen.=—The methods of estimating nitric nitrogen,\r\nboth when present in weighable quantities and as mere traces have\r\nbeen sufficiently described in the first volume. For convenience,\r\nhowever, the standard methods of procedure will be given here. The\r\nmoist combustion methods adapted to nitrates and the volumetric copper\r\noxid process have already been described. Of the reduction methods\r\nthe process of Ulsch is one of the easiest of application and also\r\nreliable. As practiced by the official chemists the manipulation is\r\nconducted as described in the first volume, page 539.\r\n\r\n=206. Ulsch Method, Applicable to Mixed Fertilizers.=—The method of\r\nUlsch which is found to give good results with pure nitrates or with\r\nnitrates in the absence of other forms of nitrogen may also be adapted\r\nto mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen in more than one form. Street\r\nhas developed such a method and shown, by analytical data, that it is\r\napplicable in a great number of cases.[174] The process is based on the\r\nsubstitution of magnesia for soda in the distillation and is carried on\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nPlace one gram of the sample in a half liter flat-bottomed flask. Add\r\nabout thirty cubic centimeters of water, one gram of reduced iron, and\r\nten cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid diluted with an equal volume\r\nof water, shake well, and allow to stand for a short time. This will\r\nremove the danger of an explosion caused by the otherwise violent\r\naction which takes place. Close the neck of the flask with a rubber\r\nstopper through which passes a glass dropping-bulb filled with water.\r\nThe flask having been stoppered, place it on a slab to which a moderate\r\nheat is applied. Allow the solution to come slowly to a boil and then\r\nboil for five minutes and cool. Add about 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, a little paraffin, and about five grams of magnesium oxid. Boil\r\nfor forty minutes, after which time all the ammonia will be distilled,\r\nand collect the ammonia in set acid.\r\n\r\nThe magnesia causes a slight frothing, which can easily be controlled\r\nby adding a little paraffin and by bringing to a boil very gradually.\r\nFully forty minutes are necessary to distil all the ammonia. Tests were\r\nmade after thirty minutes boiling and traces of ammonia were still\r\nfound; after forty minutes these traces entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe method is a quick one. One man can easily do six determinations at\r\na time, and these six determinations can be made in but a little over\r\nan hour. Magnesia gives results closely agreeing with theory and causes\r\na very slight frothing, which can be easily controlled. One gram of\r\nreduced iron is sufficient in all ordinary complete fertilizers.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is preferred to caustic soda in the distillation because it\r\nproduces less frothing and by reason of the danger of some of the\r\nsoda-lye being carried over mechanically and thus tending to produce\r\nan error of a plus nature. In the use of magnesia, assurance must be\r\nhad that it is strongly in excess. Being less active in its effects\r\na longer time for the distillation must be taken than when soda-lye\r\nis used. The modified ulsch method just described is recommended\r\nprovisionally and with the expectation that each analyst will ascertain\r\nits true merits before allowing it to displace longer approved\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n=207. Method of Schlösing-Wagner.=—The Schlösing-Wagner method for\r\nestimating nitrogen in the nitrates of fertilizers is carried out at\r\nthe Halle Experiment Station as follows:[175]\r\n\r\nA flask, figure 14, of about 250 cubic centimeters capacity, is\r\nprovided with a rubber stopper with two holes. Through one of them\r\nis passed the stem of a funnel carrying a glass stop-cock. The other\r\ncarries a delivery-tube leading to the receiving vessel. The end of\r\nthe delivery tube is bent so as to pass easily under the mouth of the\r\nmeasuring burette and is covered with a piece of rubber tubing.\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of saturated ferrous chlorid solution and the\r\nsame quantity of ten per cent hydrochloric acid are placed in the\r\nflask. The ferrous chlorid solution is obtained by dissolving nails\r\nor other small pieces of iron in hot hydrochloric acid and it is kept\r\nin glass stoppered flasks, of about fifty cubic centimeters capacity,\r\nentirely filled. The content of one flask is enough for about twelve\r\ndeterminations and by using the whole content of a flask as soon as\r\npossible after opening, any danger of oxidation which would take place\r\nin a large flask frequently opened is avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14. SCHLÖSING-WAGNER APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe contents of the flask are boiled until all the air is driven off.\r\nThe delivery-tube is then placed under the measuring-tube, which is\r\nfilled with forty per cent potash-lye. The measuring-tube is previously\r\nalmost filled with potash-lye and then a few drops of water added and\r\nthe tube covered with a piece of filter-paper. By a careful and quick\r\ninversion the measuring-tube can be brought into the vessel receiving\r\nit without any danger of air entering. The boiling is continued for\r\nsome time and when no more air escapes, the end of the delivery-tube is\r\nbrought into another freshly filled measuring-tube and the estimation\r\nis commenced.\r\n\r\nTen cubic centimeters of a normal saltpeter solution, containing two\r\nand a half grams of pure sodium nitrate in 100 cubic centimeters are\r\nplaced in the funnel and, with continued boiling, allowed to pass,\r\ndrop by drop, into the flask. When almost all has run out the funnel\r\nis washed three times with ten cubic centimeters of ten per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid and this is allowed to pass, drop by drop, into\r\nthe flask. When no more nitric oxid is evolved the measuring-tube is\r\ntransferred to a large jar filled with distilled water.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the substance to be examined should be taken in such\r\nquantity as will give about the same quantity of gas as is furnished\r\nby the ten cubic centimeters test nitrate solution before described;\r\n_viz._, about seventy cubic centimeters. Eight or ten determinations\r\ncan be made, one following the other, and at the end another\r\ndetermination with normal sodium nitrate solution should be made as\r\na check. At the end of the operation all of the measuring-tubes are\r\nin the large jar filled with distilled water. The temperature of the\r\nsurrounding water will soon be imparted to the contents of each tube\r\nand the volume of nitric oxid is read by bringing the level within\r\nand without the measuring-tube to the same point. The percentages are\r\ncalculated for the given temperature and barometer pressure in the\r\nusual way; or to avoid computation the volume can be compared directly\r\nwith the volume furnished by a normal nitrate solution, which is a much\r\nsimpler method.\r\n\r\n=208. Schmitt’s Modified Method.=—The method is a modification of that\r\nalready described by the author in which a mixture of powdered zinc\r\nand iron is used as a reducing agent.[176] The process is carried out\r\nas follows: Ten grams of the nitrate are dissolved and the volume made\r\nup to half a liter. Ten cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid and\r\nten grams of the fine metallic powder, iron and zinc, are placed in a\r\nflask of a capacity of about three-quarters of a liter and twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution of the nitrate added. The flask is\r\ncovered during the reduction to prevent loss by spraying, and after\r\nthe solution is complete, which is the case in about ten minutes,\r\nthe contents of the flask are diluted with from 200 to 300 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, thirty cubic centimeters of caustic soda of 1.25\r\nspecific gravity added, and the whole distilled as in the kjeldahl\r\nprocess. It must be noted that it is essential that the iron be finely\r\ndivided; it is mixed with the powdered zinc in equal parts. The total\r\nnitrogen can be determined in guanos and nitrate mixtures by the\r\nfollowing simple alteration in procedure: One gram of the substance is\r\ndissolved in water, five cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid, and\r\nfrom two to three grams of the mixed metallic powder added, and the\r\nwhole gently heated for ten or fifteen minutes. After the contents of\r\nthe flask have cooled, twenty-five cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid\r\nare cautiously added in small portions, undue frothing being restrained\r\nby the addition of a fragment of paraffin wax. The acetic acid is then\r\ndriven off by heating, and the remaining contents of the flask boiled\r\nuntil the organic matter is completely decomposed, as in the kjeldahl\r\nprocess. About two hours boiling is required. Neutralization and\r\ndistillation are then practiced as in the ordinary manner. The method\r\nis also applicable to the determination of nitrates in drinking water,\r\nprovided nitrites and ammonia be absent.\r\n\r\n=209. Krüger’s Method for Nitric Acid.=—About three-tenths gram of the\r\nsubstance dissolved in water is mixed with twenty cubic centimeters of\r\na hydrochloric acid solution of stannous chlorid holding 150 grams of\r\ntin per liter.[177] One and a half grams of spongy tin prepared by the\r\naction of zinc on stannous chlorid are added. The flask containing the\r\nmixture is heated until the tin is dissolved, by which time the nitric\r\nacid is completely reduced. The subsequent distillation and titration\r\nare accomplished as usual. In the case of nitro and nitroso compounds,\r\nafter the solution of the tin, twenty cubic centimeters of sulfuric\r\nacid are added and heated until sulfuric vapors escape. After cooling,\r\nthe amido substances formed are oxidized by potassium bichromate before\r\nthe distillation takes place.\r\n\r\nKrüger also estimates the nitrogen in benzol, pyridin, and chinolin\r\nderivatives by dissolving them in sulfuric acid, using from two-tenths\r\nto eight-tenths of a gram of the alkaloidal bodies and, after\r\ncooling the solution, oxidizing by adding finely powdered potassium\r\nbichromate.[178] About half a gram more of the potassium bichromate\r\nshould be used than is necessary for the oxidation of the substances in\r\nsolution. The entire oxidation does not consume more than from fifteen\r\nto thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM NITRATE.\r\n\r\n=210. Functions of Sodium Nitrate.=—Practically the only form of\r\noxidized nitrogen which is of importance from an agronomic point of\r\nview is sodium nitrate, often known in commerce by the name Chile\r\nsaltpeter. Applied to a growing crop it at once becomes dissolved at\r\nthe first rainfall or by the natural moisture of the soil. It carries\r\nthus to the rootlets of plants a supply of nitrogen in the most highly\r\navailable state. There is perhaps no other kind of plant food which\r\nis offered to the living vegetable in a more completely predigested\r\nstate, and none to which a quicker response will be given. By reason\r\nof its high availability, however, it must be used with care. A too\r\nfree use of such a stimulating food may have, in the end, an injurious\r\neffect upon the crop, and is quite certain to lead to the waste of a\r\nconsiderable portion of expensive material. For this reason sodium\r\nnitrate should be applied with extreme care, in small quantities at\r\na time and only when it is needed by the growing crop. It would be\r\nuseless, for instance, to apply this fertilizer in the autumn with\r\nthe expectation of its benefitting the crop to a maximum degree the\r\nfollowing spring. Again, if the application of this salt should be made\r\njust previous to a heavy rain almost or quite the whole of it would be\r\nremoved beyond the reach of the absorbing organs of the plant.\r\n\r\nWhen once the nitric acid has been absorbed by the living rootlet it\r\nis held with great tenacity. Living plants macerated in water give up\r\nonly a trace of nitric acid, but if they be previously killed with\r\nchloroform the nitric acid they contain is easily leached out.\r\n\r\nThe molecule of sodium nitrate is decomposed in the process of the\r\nabsorption of the nitric acid. The acid enters the plant organism and\r\nthe soda is excreted and left to combine with the soil acids. The\r\nnascent soda may thus play a role of some importance in decomposing\r\nparticles of minerals containing potash or phosphoric acid. It is\r\nprobable that the decomposition of the sodium nitrate takes place\r\nin the cells of the absorbing plant organs for it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how it could be accomplished externally. While the soda\r\ntherefore is of no importance as a direct plant food it can hardly be\r\ndismissed as of no value whatever in the process of fertilization.\r\nMany of the salts of soda as, for instance, common salt, are quite\r\nhygroscopic and serve to attract moisture from the air and thus become\r\ncarriers of water between the plant and the air in seasons of drought;\r\nand sodium nitrate itself is so hygroscopic as not to be suited to the\r\nmanufacture of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: The chief functions of sodium nitrate are to give\r\nto the plant a supply of oxidized nitrogen ready for absorption into\r\nits tissues and incidentally to aid, by the residual soda, in the\r\ndecomposition of silt particles containing potash or phosphoric acid\r\nand in supplying to the soil salts of a more or less deliquescent\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n=211. Commercial Forms of Chile Saltpeter.=—The Chile saltpeter of\r\ncommerce may reach the farmer or analyst in the lumpy state in which\r\nit is shipped or as finely ground and ready for application to the\r\nfields. Unless the farmer is provided with means for grinding, the\r\nlatter condition is much to be preferred. It permits of a more even\r\ndistribution of the salt and thus encourages economy in its use. For\r\nthe chemist also it is advantageous to have the finely ground material,\r\nwhich condition permits more easily a perfect sampling, a process\r\nwhich, with the unground salt, is attended with no little difficulty.\r\n\r\n=212. Percentage of Nitrogen in Chile Saltpeter.=—Chemically pure\r\nsodium nitrate contains 16.49 per cent of nitrogen. The salt of\r\ncommerce is never pure. It contains moisture, potash, magnesia, lime,\r\nsulfur, chlorin, iodin, silica and insoluble materials, and traces of\r\nother bodies. The value of the salt depends, therefore, not only on the\r\nmarket value of nitrogen at the time of sale, but also on its content\r\nof nitrogen. The nitrate of commerce varies greatly in its nitrogen\r\ncontent and is sold on a guaranty of its purity. The best grades\r\nrange in nitrogen from fifteen to sixteen per cent. The content of\r\nnitrogen has long been estimated in the trade by determining the other\r\nconstituents and counting the rest as nitrogen. This practice arose\r\nin former times when no convenient method was at hand for determining\r\nnitric nitrogen. The process is tiresome and unreliable because all\r\nerrors of every kind are accumulated in the nitrogen content, but\r\ninasmuch as the method is still required by many merchants, the analyst\r\nshould be acquainted with it, and it is therefore given further along.\r\nThe usual methods for determining nitric nitrogen may be applied in all\r\ncases where samples of sodium nitrate are under examination, but some\r\nspecial processes are added for convenience.\r\n\r\n=213. Adulteration of Chile Saltpeter.=—The analyst is the only\r\nprotector of the farmer in guarding against the practice of\r\nadulteration of sodium nitrate aside from the honesty of the dealer.\r\nEven the honest dealer is compelled to protect himself against fraud,\r\nand therefore, the world over, commerce in this fertilizer is now\r\nconducted solely on the analyst’s certificate. Happily, therefore,\r\nadulteration is almost unknown because it is certain to be detected.\r\nFormerly, the saltpeter was adulterated with common salt, or low grade\r\nsalts from the potash mines; but it is an extremely rare thing now to\r\nfind any impurities in the salts other than those naturally present.\r\n\r\nIn every case the analyst may grow suspicious when he finds the content\r\nof nitrogen in a sample to fall below thirteen per cent. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that some potassium nitrate may be present in the\r\nsample, and since that salt contains only 13.87 per cent of nitrogen\r\nits presence would tend to lower the value of the fertilizer; but\r\nalthough the potash itself is a fertilizer of value it is not worth\r\nmore than one-third as much as nitrogen. In all cases of suspected\r\nadulteration, it is advisable to make a complete analysis. The results\r\nof this work will, as a rule, lead the analyst to a correct judgment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15. HALLE NITRIC ACID APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n=214. The Halle Zinc-Iron Method.=—For determining the nitrogen in\r\nChile saltpeter the reduction method is conducted at the Halle Station\r\nas follows:[179] Ten grams of the nitrate are dissolved in one liter\r\nand fifty cubic centimeters of the solution corresponding to half\r\na gram of the sample, taken for each determination. The apparatus\r\nemployed is shown in Fig. 15. A mixture of five grams of zinc dust\r\nand an equal weight of iron filings is employed as the source of\r\nhydrogen. The reduction takes place in an alkaline medium secured by\r\nadding to the other materials mentioned, eighty cubic centimeters of\r\nsoda-lye of 1.30 specific gravity. The respective quantities of iron\r\nand zinc may be measured instead of weighed, as exact proportions are\r\nnot required. After the addition of all the materials the flask is\r\nallowed to stand for an hour at room temperature. The distillation\r\nis then commenced and continued until at least 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof distillate have been collected. The receiving flasks are ordinary\r\nerlenmeyers, each of which contains twenty cubic centimeters of set\r\nsulfuric acid, as in the usual kjeldahl process. The flasks are sealed\r\nwith a few drops of water by the device shown in the figure. After the\r\nend of the operation the water in each one is washed back into its\r\nproper flask with freshly boiled water. During the vigorous evolution\r\nof hydrogen, at the beginning of the operation, some kind of a safety\r\narrangement is necessary to prevent the particles of soda-lye being\r\ncarried over by the bubbles of that gas. The siphon bulb shown in the\r\nfigure is found effective for this purpose. In this operation better\r\nresults are obtained by condensing the escaping steam, and for this\r\nreason the block tin tubes are conducted through a tank supplied with\r\na current of cold water. The ends of the tubes should not dip below\r\nthe surface of the liquid in the receivers. When the condensed liquid\r\ncollects in considerable quantities in the safety tube the lamp should\r\nbe extinguished under the flask, which permits the return of the liquid\r\nto the flask by means of the siphon. This should be done two or three\r\ntimes during the progress of the distillation to prevent a too high\r\nconcentration of the soda-lye, thus endangering the flask. The excess\r\nof the acid in the receiver is determined by titration, as in the\r\nregular kjeldahl method. Blank determinations should be made, from time\r\nto time, and corrections made in harmony therewith.\r\n\r\n=215. Method of the French Sugar Chemists.=—The nitrogen in Chile\r\nsaltpeter is estimated by the French chemists according to the method\r\nof Schlösing, described in the first volume, page 500. In order to\r\navoid the trouble of calculating the results from the volume of nitric\r\noxid obtained, a determination is first made with a pure salt, sodium\r\nor potassium nitrate. The volume of gas obtained is read directly\r\nwithout correction and taken for direct comparison. The comparison is\r\nmade as follows:\r\n\r\nThe solutions of the pure salts and of the sample to be analyzed\r\nare made of such a strength as to contain sixty-six grams of sodium\r\nnitrate, or eighty grams of potassium nitrate, in a liter. Five cubic\r\ncentimeters of such a solution will yield a little less than 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of nitric oxid under usual conditions. Let the volume of\r\ngas obtained with the pure salt be _v_; and that with the sample be\r\n_v′_. The calculation is then made from the equation:\r\n\r\n    _v′_    _x_\r\n    ---- = ----.\r\n    _v_     100\r\n\r\n    _Example_: Let ninety-five cubic centimeters be the volume of\r\n    gas from five cubic centimeters of the pure salt (sodium nitrate),\r\n    and 91.5 cubic centimeters be the volume of gas from five cubic\r\n    centimeters of the sample; then\r\n\r\n    91.5   _x_\r\n    ---- = ----, whence _x_ = 96.31.\r\n     95    100\r\n\r\n    Hence the sample analyzed contains 96.31 per cent of sodium\r\n    nitrate. Since the pure sodium nitrate contains 16.47 per cent of\r\n    nitrogen the sample under examination would contain\r\n\r\n    16.47 × 96.31\r\n    ------------- = 15.86 per cent.\r\n         100\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this comparative method is quite easy of application\r\nwhen the sample under examination has no other nitrate in it except\r\nthat combined with the one base.\r\n\r\n=216. Volumetric Method of Gantter.=—The process proposed by Gantter\r\nfor determining the nitrogen, volumetrically, in Chile saltpeter and\r\nother nitrates is based on the following principles:[180]\r\n\r\n(1) If a nitrate be heated in contact with sulfuric and phosphorous\r\nacids, nitrous acid will be formed.\r\n\r\n(2) If nitrous acid be boiled with ammonium chlorid, nitrogen will\r\nbe quantitatively evolved from both compounds. These processes are\r\nillustrated by the following formulas:\r\n\r\n    (a) N₂O₅ + P₂O₃ = N₂O₃ + P₂O₅.\r\n\r\n    (b) N₂O₃ + 2NH₄Cl = 2N₂ + 3H₂O + 2HCl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16. GANTTER’S NITROGEN APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIt is seen from the above that the nitrate will give, by this\r\ntreatment, double the volume of nitrogen which it contains. In\r\npractice, the two reactions may be secured in one operation by warming\r\nthe nitrate solution slowly with sulfuric and phosphorous acids and\r\nammonium chlorid. The nitric acid, as it becomes free, gives a part\r\nof its oxygen to the phosphorous compound, and the nitrous acid, in\r\na nascent state, is at once reduced by the ammonium chlorid. There\r\nare two sources of error which must be guarded against in the work; a\r\nportion of the nitrogen may escape reduction to the elementary state,\r\nor some of the nitrate may fail to be decomposed. These errors are\r\neasily avoided if the reaction be begun slowly, so that the evolution\r\nof gas may be gradual. The temperatures at first should, therefore,\r\nbe kept as low as possible. The development of red fumes, showing the\r\npresence of undecomposed nitrogen oxids, shows that the results will be\r\ntoo low. It is necessary, also, to provide for the absorption of the\r\nhydrochloric acid which is formed. The reaction is very conveniently\r\nconducted in the apparatus shown in Fig. 16. The decomposition takes\r\nplace in the flask A and the mixed gases pass into the absorption bulb\r\nC. The delivery-tube is very much expanded, as shown in the figure,\r\nso that no soda-lye can enter A during the cooling of the flask. The\r\nabsorption bulb is connected with A and B by the tubes a and b as\r\nshown. The tube d connects the apparatus with the gasvolumeter.[181]\r\nThe bulb B serves as a pipette for the introduction of the decomposing\r\nacid. The operation is conducted as follows: Three cubic centimeters\r\nof the nitrate solution, containing no more than 300 milligrams\r\nof substance, are placed in the flask A with half a gram each of\r\ncrystallized ammonium chlorid and phosphorous acid. In the bulb B are\r\nplaced seven cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid to which has been\r\nadded one-third its volume of water. Two cubic centimeters of acid are\r\nallowed to flow from B into A. The apparatus is brought to a constant\r\ntemperature by being immersed in a large cylinder, E, containing water\r\nat a temperature which can easily be controlled. When this constant\r\ntemperature has been reached the apparatus is taken from the cooling\r\ncylinder which contains also a smaller cylinder, D, nearly filled\r\nwith water and connected through f′ with the measuring apparatus M.\r\nThe barometer-tube F is half filled with colored water so that the\r\npressure may be equalized before and after the operation. The flask A\r\nis warmed very gently at first, and the nitrogen evolved is conducted\r\ninto D driving an equivalent volume of water into M. The evolution of\r\nthe gas must be carefully controlled and the heat at once removed if it\r\nbecome too rapid. The appearance of a red color shows the evolution of\r\noxids of nitrogen rendering the analysis inexact. When the evolution of\r\nnitrogen has nearly ceased the lamp is removed and some more sulfuric\r\nacid allowed to flow into A from B, after which A is again heated, this\r\ntime to the boiling-point. All vapors of hydrochloric acid produced are\r\nabsorbed by the soda-lye in C. The boiling is continued a few minutes,\r\nbut not long enough to darken the liquid in A. After replacing the\r\napparatus in the cylinder E and bringing both temperature and pressure\r\nto the same point as before the beginning of the operation, the volume\r\nof nitrogen evolved is determined by measuring the water in M.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is first set by using pure potassium or sodium nitrate.\r\nSince the temperature and pressure do not vary much within an hour or\r\ntwo the volume of water obtained with a sample of white saltpeter can\r\nbe compared directly with that given off by the same weight of a pure\r\npotassium or sodium nitrate without correction.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Two hundred and fifty milligrams of potassium nitrate,\r\ncontaining 34.625 milligrams of nitrogen, displaced in a given case\r\nsixty cubic centimeters of water; therefore one cubic centimeter\r\nof water equals 0.578 milligram of nitrogen. If 289 instead of 250\r\nmilligrams be taken then the number of cubic centimeters of water\r\ndisplaced divided by five will give the per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=217. Method of Difference.=—In the analysis of Chile saltpeter by the\r\ndirect method a variation of 0.25 per cent in the content of nitrogen\r\nis allowed from the dealers’ guaranty. This would allow a total\r\nvariation in the content of sodium nitrate of 1.52 per cent. Dealers\r\nand shippers have always been accustomed to estimate the quantity\r\nof sodium nitrate in a sample by difference; _i. e._, by estimating\r\nthe constituents not sodium nitrate and subtracting the sum of the\r\nresults from 100. Chile saltpeter usually contains sodium nitrate,\r\nwater, insoluble ferruginous matters, sodium chlorid, sodium sulfate,\r\nmagnesium chlorid, sodium iodate, calcium sulfate and sometimes small\r\nquantities of potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\nWhen the total sodium nitrate is to be estimated by difference the\r\nfollowing procedure, arranged by Crispo,[182] may be followed:\r\n\r\n_Water._—Dry ten grams of the finely powdered sample to constant weight\r\nat 150°-160°.\r\n\r\n_Chlorin._—The residue, after drying, is dissolved and the volume\r\nmade up to one-fourth liter with water and the chlorin determined in\r\none-fifth thereof and calculated as sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble._—Twenty grams are treated with water until all soluble\r\nmatter has disappeared, filtered on a tared gooch, and the filtrate\r\ndried to constant weight.\r\n\r\n_Sulfuric Acid._—The sulfuric acid is precipitated by barium chlorid\r\nin the slightly acid filtrate from the insoluble matter. The acidity\r\nis produced by a few drops of nitric acid. The rest of the process is\r\nconducted in the usual way.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia._—This is precipitated by ammonium sodium phosphate,\r\nfiltered, ignited, and weighed as pyrophosphate. The magnesium is then\r\ncalculated as chlorid. Magnesia is rarely found in excess of one-fourth\r\nper cent. When this amount is not exceeded the estimation of it may be\r\nneglected without any great error. As has already been said the chlorin\r\nis all calculated as sodium chlorid. If a part of it be combined with\r\none-fourth per cent of magnesia it would represent 0.59 per cent of\r\nmagnesium chlorid instead of 0.73 per cent sodium chlorid. In omitting\r\nthe estimation of the magnesia therefore the importer is only damaged\r\nto the extent of 0.14 per cent of sodium nitrate.\r\n\r\n_Sodium Iodate._—This body, present only in small quantities, may also\r\nbe neglected. In case the content of this body should reach one-fourth\r\nper cent the estimation of chlorin by titration using potassium\r\nchromate as indicator is impracticable. Such an instance, however, is\r\nrarely known.\r\n\r\n_Approximate Results._—When the determinations outlined above have been\r\ncarefully made it is claimed that the result obtained by subtraction\r\nfrom 100 will not vary more than from two-tenths to three-tenths per\r\ncent from the true content of sodium nitrate. The method, however,\r\ncannot be considered strictly scientific and is much more tedious\r\nand chronophagous than the direct determination. In the direct\r\ndetermination, however, the analyst must assure himself that potassium\r\nis present in only appreciable quantities otherwise the per cent of\r\nsodium nitrate will be too low.\r\n\r\nThe presence of potassium nitrate is a detriment in this respect\r\nonly; _viz._, that it contains a less percentage of nitrogen than\r\nthe corresponding sodium salt. As a fertilizer, the value of Chile\r\nsaltpeter may be increased by its content of potassium.\r\n\r\n=218. The Application of Chile Saltpeter to the Soil.=—The analyst\r\nis often asked to determine the desirability of the use of sodium\r\nnitrate as a fertilizer and the methods and times of applying it.\r\nThese are questions which are scarcely germane to the purpose of this\r\nwork but which, nevertheless, for the sake of convenience may be\r\nbriefly discussed. In the first place it may be said that the data of\r\na chance chemical analysis will not afford a sufficiently broad basis\r\nfor an answer. A given soil may be very rich in nitrogen as revealed\r\nby chemical analysis, and yet poor in an available supply. This is\r\nfrequently the case with vegetable soils, containing, as they do, large\r\nquantities of nitrogen but holding it in practically an inert state.\r\nI have found such soils very rich in nitrogen, yet almost entirely\r\ndevoid of nitrifying organisms. It is necessary therefore in reaching a\r\njudgment on this subject from analytical data to consider the different\r\nstates in which the nitrogen may exist in a soil and above all the\r\nnitrifying power of the soil if the nitrogen be chiefly present in\r\nan organic state. Culture solutions should therefore be seeded with\r\nsamples of the soil under examination and the beginning and rapidity\r\nof the nitrification carefully noted. In conjunction with this the\r\nnitrogen present in the soil in a nitric or ammoniacal form should be\r\naccurately determined. These determinations should be made according to\r\nthe directions given in the first volume, pp. 448-548.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of nitrifying power we prefer the following\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\n=219. Taking Samples of Soil in Sterilized Tubes.=—Brass tubes are\r\nprepared twenty centimeters in length and one and a half in diameter.\r\nOne end is ground to a beveled edge and compressed in a mold so as to\r\nmake the cutting edge slightly smaller in diameter than the internal\r\ndiameter of the tube. It is then ground or filed until smooth and\r\nsharp. The blunt end of the tube is stoppered loosely with cotton and\r\nit is then sterilized by heating for an hour to 150°. Rubber caps\r\nare provided and each one has placed at the bottom a rubber ball to\r\nprevent the rubber from being cut by the edges of the brass tube. The\r\ncaps should be of two distinct colors. Half of the rubber caps are\r\nsterilized by being boiled for an hour in water for three successive\r\ndays. The caps cannot be heated to 150° dry heat with safety. On\r\nremoving the brass tube from the sterilizing oven as soon as it is cool\r\nenough to handle, a sterilized rubber cap is slipped over its cutting\r\nend. An unsterilized cap is then slipped over the other end containing\r\nthe cotton plug. Inasmuch as the cotton plug is never removed it is not\r\nnecessary to sterilize the cap covering it. Large numbers of the tubes\r\ncan thus be prepared for use and they can be safely transmitted to a\r\ndistance by express or mail. For convenience, each tube is encased in a\r\nsmall cloth bag, which is tied with a cord carrying a tag on which the\r\nnecessary data can be recorded at the time of taking the sample.\r\n\r\nThe tubes and their rubber caps thus carefully sterilized should not\r\nbe removed from their cloth envelopes until the moment of taking each\r\nsample. After the sample has been taken and the cap replaced on the\r\ntube the latter should be immediately enclosed in the cloth sack and\r\nlabeled with one of the tags therewith enclosed. The sample should\r\nbe taken in two kinds of soil, in one instance in a cultivated soil,\r\nwhich is most characteristic of the locality, and in the second place\r\na virgin soil of the same type. The virgin soil may be either soil\r\nwhich has been covered with grass or in forest. The spots at which the\r\nsamples are to be taken having been previously selected, the tags for\r\neach tube should be prepared beforehand so as to avoid delay at the\r\ntime of sampling. A pit with straight walls should be dug, the sides of\r\nwhich are at least two feet wide and even three feet would be better.\r\nThe pit should be about forty-two inches deep. One of the sides having\r\nbeen made perfectly smooth and without allowing the loose fragments\r\nfrom the top to fall down and adhere to the walls below, the spots at\r\nwhich the samples are to be taken should be marked with a tape line\r\nat the following points; _viz._, three, fifteen, twenty-seven, and\r\nthirty-nine inches, respectively, below the surface. Beginning at the\r\nbottom point, carefully scrape off the surface of the wall over an\r\narea slightly larger than that of the end of the sample tube by means\r\nof a spatula, which, just previous to use, has been held for a moment\r\nor two in the flame of an alcohol or other convenient lamp. The sample\r\ntube having been removed from its sack, it will be noted that the end\r\ncovered with black rubber is the one which is to be held in the hand,\r\nand this black rubber cap should be first removed being careful not\r\nto extract the plug of sterilized cotton which closes the end of the\r\ntube. Holding the tube firmly by the end, the fingers extending only\r\nabout two inches from the end, remove the light-colored cap and push\r\nthe tube with a turning motion into the side of the pit at the point\r\nwhere the surface has been removed with the sterilized spatula. When\r\nthis is properly done the tube will be filled with a cylinder of soil\r\nequal to the length of the part of the tube penetrating the wall of the\r\npit. The tube is then withdrawn, the light rubber cap first replaced,\r\nand then the black one. The light rubber cap should be held in the hand\r\nduring the process in such a way that no dust or particles of soil are\r\npermitted to contaminate its inner walls. For this purpose the open\r\nend of the cap should be held downward. For the same reason after the\r\nremoval of the light rubber cap the brass tube should be carefully\r\npreserved from dust or fragments, the open end, that is the cutting\r\nend, being held downward until ready for use. After one tube has been\r\nfilled, capped, replaced in the sack and labeled, the spatula should be\r\nagain sterilized and samples taken in regular order until the top one\r\nis finished.\r\n\r\n=220. Directions for Taking Bulk Samples.=—From the sides of the pit\r\ndescribed above, bulk samples should be taken as follows:\r\n\r\nBy means of a spade the soil should be removed from the four sides to\r\nthe depth of six or nine inches or until the change of color between\r\nthe soil and subsoil is noted; in all enough to make about 150 pounds\r\nof the air-dried soil. In the same way take a sample of the subsoil to\r\nthe depth of nine additional inches. Remove all stones, large pebbles,\r\nsticks, roots, etc., and spread the samples in a sheltered place where\r\nthey can be air-dried as rapidly as possible. The bulk samples should\r\nbe taken both from the cultivated and virgin soils. In selecting the\r\ncultivated soil, preference should be given to those soils which have\r\nnot been fertilized within a few years. If recent fertilization have\r\nbeen practiced the character and amount of it should be noted.\r\n\r\n=221. The Nitrifiable Solution.=—The solution to test the nitrifying\r\npower of the samples collected as above described is conveniently made\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Potassium phosphate,   one gram per liter.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate,     half a gram per liter.\r\n    Calcium chlorid,       a trace.\r\n    Ammonium sulfate,      200 milligrams of nitrogen per liter.\r\n    Calcium carbonate,     in excess.\r\n\r\nOne liter of the above solution is enough for ten samples, each of 100\r\ncubic centimeters. This quantity is placed in an erlenmeyer, which\r\nis stoppered with cotton and sterilized by being kept at 100° for an\r\nhour on three successive days. The erlenmeyer should be sterilized\r\nbeforehand by heating for an hour at 150°. The freshly precipitated and\r\nwashed calcium carbonate should be sterilized separately and added to\r\neach erlenmeyer at the time of seeding. Enough should always be used\r\nto be in excess of the nitrous and nitric acids found. The seeding is\r\naccomplished by filling a sterilized spoon which holds approximately\r\nhalf a gram of the soil, from the contents of one of the brass tubes,\r\nlifting the plug in the erlenmeyer and transferring quickly to the\r\nflask. This should be done in a perfectly still room, preferably\r\nas high above the ground as possible and in a place free from dust\r\nand under cover. The cotton plug being replaced the erlenmeyer is\r\nshaken until the sample of soil added is thoroughly disintegrated\r\nand intimately mixed with its contents. With care and experience\r\nthe seeding is easily accomplished without danger of accidental\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each period of five days the beginning and progress of\r\nnitrification should be determined by some of the methods described in\r\nvolume first. Either the ammonia can be determined by nesslerizing or\r\nthe nitrous and nitric acids estimated. For nitrous acid we prefer the\r\nmethod described in volume first, paragraph =504=, and for nitric the\r\none in same volume paragraphs =497= and =498=.\r\n\r\nBy supplementing the analysis of a soil by the above described\r\nexperiments in nitrification the analyst will be able to judge with\r\nsufficient accuracy of its needs for nitric nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=222. Quantity of Chile Saltpeter to be Applied.=—The quantities of\r\nChile saltpeter which should be applied per acre vary with so many\r\nconditions as to make any definite statement impossible. On account\r\nof the great solubility of this salt no more should be used than is\r\nnecessary for the nutrition of the crop. For each 100 pounds used,\r\nfrom fourteen to fifteen pounds of nitrogen will be added to the soil.\r\nField crops, as a rule, will require less of the salt than garden\r\ncrops. There is an economic limit to the application which should not\r\nbe passed. As a rule 250 pounds per acre will prove to be a maximum\r\ndressing. The character of the crop must also be considered. Different\r\namounts are required for sugar beets, tobacco, wheat, and other\r\nstandard crops. It is rarely the case that a crop demands a dressing of\r\nChile saltpeter alone. It will give the best effects, as a rule, when\r\napplied with phosphoric acid or potash. But this is a branch of the\r\nsubject which cannot be entered into at greater length in this manual.\r\nThe reader is referred to Stutzer’s work on Chile saltpeter for further\r\ninformation.[183]\r\n\r\n=223. Consumption of Chile Saltpeter.=—The entire consumption of sodium\r\nnitrate for manurial purposes in the whole world for 1894 was 992,150\r\nmetric tons, valued at $41,000,000. For the several countries using it\r\nthe consumption was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Germany            397,200 tons.\r\n    France             187,100  “\r\n    England            117,000  “\r\n    Belgium            123,000  “\r\n    United States      100,000  “\r\n    Holland             56,700  “\r\n    Italy and Spain      5,200  “\r\n    Other countries      5,950  “\r\n                       -------\r\n       Total           992,150  “\r\n\r\nThe above figures represent the actual commerce of each country in\r\nChile saltpeter, and may not give the exact consumption.[184] For\r\ninstance, Germany exports sodium nitrate to Russia and Austria, but\r\nit imports this salt from Holland and Belgium. Belgium imports from\r\nFrance, but its exportation is greater than its importations from that\r\ncountry, so that its actual consumption on the farm probably falls\r\nconsiderably below that given on the table. Holland also exports larger\r\nquantities than are imported from neighboring states. The exports from\r\nEngland are inconsiderable compared with the quantities received,\r\namounting only to about 5,000 tons a year, while the exportations from\r\nFrance reach nearly 10,000 tons.\r\n\r\nSodium nitrate has a moderate value at the factories where it is\r\nprepared for shipment in Chile. Its chief value at the ports where\r\nit is delivered for consumption comes from freights and profits of\r\nthe syndicate. The factories, where it is prepared for the market,\r\nare at or near the deposits, and the freights thence to the sea coast\r\nare very high. The rail roads which have been constructed to the high\r\nplateaux which contain the deposits, have been built at a very great\r\ncost, and the freights charged are correspondingly high. There is also\r\na tax of $1.20 levied on each ton exported. Deducting all costs of\r\ntransportation and export duties the actual value of sodium nitrate at\r\nthe factory, ready for shipment, is about sixteen dollars in gold a ton.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SECOND.\r\n\r\n[125] American Chemical Journal, Vol. 13, No. 7.\r\n\r\n[126] Atwater: Report of the U.

Introduction.=—The potash present in unfertilized soils has been\r\nderived from the decay of rocks containing potash minerals. Among\r\nthese potash producers feldspars are perhaps the most important. For\r\na discussion of the nature of their decomposition and the causes\r\nproducing it the first part of volume first may be consulted. Potash is\r\nquite as extensively distributed as phosphoric acid and no true soils\r\nare without it in some proportion. Its presence is necessary to plant\r\ngrowth and it forms, in combination with organic and mineral acids, an\r\nessential part of the vegetable organism, existing in exceptionally\r\nrich quantities in the seeds. It is possible that potash salts, such\r\nas the chlorid, sulfate, and phosphate may be assimilated as such,\r\nbut, as with other compounds, we must not deny to the plant the\r\nremarkable faculty of being able to decompose its most stable salts\r\nand to form from the fragments thus produced entirely new compounds.\r\nThis is certainly true of the potash compounds existing in plants in\r\ncombination with organic acids. The potash which is assimilated by\r\nplants exists in the soil chiefly in a mineral state, and that added as\r\nfertilizer is chiefly in the same condition. That part of the potash in\r\na soil arising directly from the decomposition of vegetable matters may\r\nexist partly in organic combination, but this portion, in comparison\r\nwith the total quantity absorbed by the plant, is insignificant.\r\n\r\nIt is then safe to assume that at least a considerable part of the\r\npotash absorbed by the plant is decomposed from its original form\r\nof combination by the vegetable biochemical forces, and is finally\r\nincorporated in the plant tissues in forms determined by the same\r\npowerful forces of vegetable metabolism.\r\n\r\nThe analyst is not often called upon to investigate the forms in\r\nwhich the potash exists in plants, when engaged in investigation of\r\nfertilizers. It is chiefly found in combination with organic and\r\nphosphoric acids, and on ignition will appear as phosphate or carbonate\r\nin the ash.\r\n\r\n=225. Forms in which Potash is Found in Fertilizers.=—The chief\r\nnatural sources of potash used in fertilizer fabrication are: First,\r\norganic compounds, such as desiccated mineral matters, tobacco\r\nwaste, cottonseed hulls, etc.; second, the ash derived from burning\r\nterrestrial plants of all kinds; third, the natural mineral deposits,\r\nsuch as Stassfurt salts.\r\n\r\nAll of these forms of potash may be found in mixed fertilizers. While\r\nthe final methods of analyses are the same in all cases the preliminary\r\ntreatment is very different, being adapted to the nature of the sample.\r\nFor analytical purposes, it is highly important that the potash be\r\nbrought into a soluble mineral form, and that any organic matters which\r\nthe sample contains be destroyed. If the sample be already of a mineral\r\nnature, it may still be mixed with other organic matter and then it\r\nrequires treatment as above, for it is not safe always to rely solely\r\non the solubility of the potash mineral, and the solution, moreover, in\r\nsuch cases, is likely to contain organic matter. In some States, only\r\nthat portion of the potash soluble in water is allowed to be considered\r\nin official fertilizer work. In these cases it is evident that the\r\norganic matter present should not be destroyed in the original sample,\r\nbut only in the aqueous solution. Since, however, the potash occluded\r\nin organic matter becomes constantly available as the process of decay\r\ngoes on, it is not just to exclude it from the available supply. It may\r\nnot be so immediately available as when in a soluble mineral state,\r\nbut it is not long before it becomes valuable. Experience has shown,\r\nmoreover, that phosphorus, nitrogen, and potash are all more valuable\r\nfinally when applied to the soil in an organic form. This fact is a\r\ncorroboration of the theory already advanced that all mineral compound\r\nbodies are probably decomposed before they enter as component parts\r\ninto the tissues of the vegetable organism.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable, therefore, that the potash existing in organic\r\ncompounds, finely divided and easily decomposed, is of equal, if not\r\ngreater value to plant life than that already in a soluble mineral\r\nstate. The organic matter, when present, is destroyed, either by\r\nignition at a low temperature, or by moist combustion with an oxidizing\r\nagent before the potash is precipitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC SOURCES OF POTASH.\r\n\r\n=226. Tobacco Stems and Waste.=—Until within a few years tobacco stems\r\nand other waste from factories, were treated as a nuisance in this\r\ncountry, and burned or dumped into streams. By burning and saving the\r\nash the potash contained in the stems and waste would be recovered in a\r\nform suitable for field use. The nitrogen, however, contained in these\r\nwaste materials, both in the form of nicotin and of albuminoids would\r\nbe lost. Ignition of this waste, therefore, should not be practiced. It\r\nshould be prepared for use by grinding to a fine powder. Applied to the\r\nsoil in this condition the powder may be useful as an insecticide as\r\nwell as a fertilizer. Tobacco stems contain from twelve to twenty-seven\r\nper cent of moisture, and from twelve to twenty per cent of ash. The\r\ncomposition of the stems from two celebrated tobacco growing regions is\r\nsubjoined:[185]\r\n\r\n                            Kentucky stems.   Connecticut stems.\r\n    Moisture                26.70 per cent.    13.47 per cent.\r\n    Organic and volatile    60.18  “   “       70.85  “   “\r\n    Ash                     13.12  “   “       15.68  “   “\r\n\r\nThe ash calculated to the original substance had the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n                             Kentucky stems.  Connecticut stems.\r\n    Phosphoric acid          0.67 per cent.    0.53 per cent.\r\n    Potash                   8.03  “   “       6.41  “   “\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that about half the ash of tobacco stems is composed\r\nof potash. The stalks of the tobacco have almost the same composition\r\nas the stems, but the percentage of ash is not quite so great. In\r\nthree samples analyzed at the Connecticut station the percentages\r\nof ash found in the water-free substance were 6.64, 7.00, and 7.46\r\nrespectively. The pure ash of the stalks was found to have the\r\nfollowing composition:[186]\r\n\r\n                                    Description of samples.\r\n    Constituents                  Cut Aug. 22.

In eighteen samples\r\nanalyzed at the Colorado station the percentages of moisture in\r\nthe leaf varied from 6.08 to 28.00, and those of ash from 22.60 to\r\n28.00.[187] The percentages of potash in the ash varied from 15.20 to\r\n26.30. In these data the carbon dioxid, sand, etc., are included, while\r\nin those quoted from the Connecticut station they were excluded.\r\n\r\n=227. Cottonseed Hulls and Meal.=—A considerable quantity of potash is\r\nadded to the soil in cottonseed meal and hulls. The practice of burning\r\nthe hulls cannot be recommended, although it is frequently practiced,\r\nfor the incineration does not increase the quantities of phosphoric\r\nacid and potash, while it destroys the availability of the nitrogen.\r\nNevertheless the analyst will often have to deal with samples of the\r\nraw materials above mentioned, as well as with the ash of the hulls, in\r\nwhich the potash can be determined by some one of the standard methods\r\nto be described. In general it is found that the hulls of seeds and the\r\nbark and leaves of plants have a greater percentage of ash than the\r\ninterior portions. In the case of cottonseed however, an exception is\r\nto be noted. The cottonseed meal in the air-dried state has about seven\r\nper cent of ash, while the hulls have only about three. When it is\r\nremembered, however, that the greater part of the oil has been removed\r\nfrom the meal it will be seen that in the whole seed in the fresh state\r\nthe discrepancy is not so marked.\r\n\r\nIn the crude ash of the hulls the percentage of potash varies generally\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five per cent, but in numerous cases these\r\nlimits are exceeded. In twelve samples of cottonseed hull ashes\r\nexamined by the Connecticut station the mean percentage of potash in\r\nthe crude sample was 22.47, and the extremes 15.57 and 30.24 per cent\r\nrespectively.[188] In determining the value of the ash per ton the\r\ncontent of phosphoric acid must also be taken into account.\r\n\r\nCottonseed meal contains about 1.75 per cent of potash. Since the mean\r\npercentage of ash in the meal is seven, the mean content of potash in\r\nthe crude ash is about twenty-five.\r\n\r\n=228. Wood Ashes.=—Unleached wood ashes furnish an important quantity\r\nof potash fertilizer. The composition of the ash of woods is extremely\r\nvariable. Not only do different varieties of trees have varying\r\nquantities of ash, but in the same variety the bark and twigs will give\r\nan ash quite different in quantity and composition from that furnished\r\nby the wood itself. In general the hard woods, such as hickory, oak,\r\nand maple, furnish a quality of ash superior for fertilizing purposes\r\nto that afforded by the soft woods, such as the pine and tulip trees.\r\n\r\nThe character of the unleached wood ashes found in the trade is\r\nindicated by the subjoined analyses. The first table contains the mean,\r\nmaximum and minimum results of the analyses of ninety-seven samples by\r\nGoessmann.[189]\r\n\r\n                                 Mean composition of wood ashes.\r\n                                    Means.

Fertilizing Value of Ashes.=—Primarily, the fertilizing value\r\nof wood-ashes depends on the quantity of plant food which they\r\ncontain. With the exception of potash and phosphoric acid, however,\r\nthe constituents of wood-ashes have little, if any, commercial\r\nvalue. The beneficial effects following the application of ashes,\r\nhowever, are greater than would be produced by the same quantities of\r\nmatter added in a purely manurial state. The organic origin of these\r\nmaterials in the ash has caused them to be presented to the plant in\r\na form peculiarly suited for absorption. Land treated generally with\r\nwood-ashes becomes more amenable to culture, is readily kept in good\r\ntilth, and thus retains moisture in dry seasons and permits of easy\r\ndrainage in wet. These effects are probably due to the lime content of\r\nthe ash, a property moreover favorable to nitrification and adapted to\r\ncorrecting acidity. Injurious iron salts, which are sometimes found in\r\nwet and sour lands, are precipitated by the ash and rendered innocuous\r\nor even beneficial. A good wood-ash fertilizer therefore is worth more\r\nthan would be indicated by its commercial value calculated in the usual\r\nway.\r\n\r\n=230. Molasses from Sugar-Beets.=—The residual molasses resulting\r\nafter the extraction of all the crystallizable sugar in beet-sugar\r\nmanufacture is very rich in potash. The molasses contains from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent of ash.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the ash varies greatly in the content of potash\r\nas well as of the other constituents.[191] The content of potassium\r\ncarbonate varies from twenty-two to fifty-five per cent and, in\r\naddition to this, some potassium sulfate and chlorid are usually\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the composition of a good quality of\r\nbeet-molasses ash:\r\n\r\n    Potassium carbonate                   45.30 per cent\r\n    Sodium        “                       13.86    “\r\n    Potassium chlorid                     22.40    “\r\n        “     sulfate                      8.00    “\r\n    Silica, lime, alumina, water,\r\n     phosphoric acid, and undetermined    15.82    “\r\n\r\nThus, in 100 parts of such an ash over three-quarters are potash salts.\r\nThe molasses may be applied directly to the soil or diluted and sprayed\r\nover the fields.\r\n\r\n=231. Residue of Wineries.=—The pomace of grapes after being pressed\r\nor fermented for wine production contains considerable quantities of\r\npotash as crude argol or acid potassium tartrate. This material can be\r\napplied directly to the soil or first burned, when its potash will be\r\nsecured in the form of carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe use of the winery refuse for fertilizing purposes has not assumed\r\nany commercial importance in this country.\r\n\r\n=232. Destruction of Organic Matter by Direct Ignition.=—The simplest\r\nand most direct method for destroying organic matter is by direct\r\nignition. The incineration may be conducted in the open air or in a\r\nmuffle and the temperature should be as low as possible. In no case\r\nshould a low red heat be exceeded. By reason of the moderate draft\r\nproduced in a muffle and the more even heat which can be maintained\r\nthis method of burning is to be preferred. With the exercise of due\r\ncare, however, excellent results can be obtained in an open dish\r\nor one partly closed with a lid. At first, with many samples, the\r\norganic matter will burn of its own accord after it is once ignited,\r\nand during this combustion the lamp should be withdrawn. The ignition\r\nin most cases should be continued in a platinum dish but should the\r\nsample contain any reducible metal capable of injuring the platinum a\r\nporcelain vessel should be used. The lamp should give a diffused flame\r\nto avoid overheating of any portions of the dish and to secure more\r\nuniform combustion. In using a muffle the heat employed should be only\r\ngreat enough to secure combustion and the draft should be so regulated\r\nas to avoid loss due to the mechanical deportation of the ash particles.\r\n\r\n=233. Ignition with Sulfuric Acid.=—The favorable action of sulfuric\r\nacid in securing a perfect incineration may also be utilized in\r\nthe preparation of samples containing organic matter for potash\r\ndeterminations. In this case the bases which by direct ignition would\r\nbe secured as carbonates are obtained as sulfates. In the method\r\nadopted by the official chemists it is directed to saturate the sample\r\nwith sulfuric acid and to ignite in a muffle until all organic matter\r\nis destroyed.[192] Afterwards, when cool the ash is moistened with a\r\nlittle hydrochloric acid and warmed, whereby it is the more easily\r\ndetached from the dish. The potash is then determined by any one of the\r\nstandard methods. This method has several advantages over the direct\r\nignition. Where any chlorids of the alkalies are present in the ash\r\nthere is danger of loss of potash from volatilization. This is avoided\r\nby the sulfate process. Moreover, there is not so much danger in this\r\nmethod of occluding particles of carbon in the ash.\r\n\r\n=234. The Destruction of Organic Matter by Moist Combustion.=—In the\r\nprocess of ignition to destroy organic matter or remove ammonium salts\r\nin the determination of potash, there are often sources of error which\r\nmay cause considerable loss. This loss, as has already been mentioned,\r\nmay arise from the volatilization of the potash salts or mechanically\r\nfrom spattering. In order to avoid these causes of error de Roode\r\nhas used aqua regia both for the destruction of the ammonium salts\r\nand for the oxidation of the organic matter at least sufficiently to\r\nprevent any subsequent reduction of the platinum chlorid.[193] His\r\nmethod consists in boiling a sample of the fertilizer, or an aliquot\r\nportion of a solution thereof with aqua regia. The proposed method\r\nhas not yet had a sufficient experimental demonstration to warrant\r\nits use, but analysts may find it profitable to compare this process\r\nwith the standard methods. The organic matter may also be destroyed by\r\ncombustion with sulfuric acid, as in the kjeldahl method for nitrogen.\r\nThe residue, however, contains ammonium sulfate and a large excess of\r\nsulfuric acid, and for both reasons would not be in a fit condition for\r\nthe estimation of potash.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the organic matter might also be destroyed\r\nby boiling with strong hydrochloric acid, to which from time to\r\ntime, small quantities of sodium chlorate free of potash is added.\r\nSubsequently the solution could be boiled with addition of a little\r\nnitric acid and the ammonium salts be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH IN MINERAL DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n=235. Occurrence and History.=—The generally accepted theory of the\r\nmanner in which potash has been collected into deposits suited to\r\nuse as a fertilizer has already been described.[194] The Stassfurt\r\ndeposits, which have for many years been almost the sole source of\r\npotash in fertilizers, were first known as mines of rock salt. In\r\n1839, having previously been acquired by the Prussian treasury, they\r\nwere abandoned by reason of the more economical working of rock salt\r\nquarries in other localities.[195] It was determined thereafter to\r\nexplore the extent of these mines by boring, and a well was sunk to\r\nthe depth of 246 meters, when the upper layer of the salt deposit was\r\nreached. The boring was continued into the salt to a total depth of 581\r\nmeters without reaching the bottom. The results of these experiments\r\nwere totally unexpected. Instead of getting a brine saturated with\r\ncommon salt, one was obtained containing large quantities of potassium\r\nand magnesium chlorids.[196] Shafts were sunk in other places, and with\r\nsuch favorable results, that in 1862 potash salts became a regular\r\narticle of commerce from that locality. At first these salts were\r\nregarded as troublesome impurities in the brine from which common\r\nsalt was to be made, but at this time the common salt has come to be\r\nregarded as the disturbing factor. At the present time the entire\r\nproduct is controlled by a syndicate of nine large firms located\r\nat Stassfurt and vicinity. Outside of the syndicate properties a\r\nshaft has been sunk at Anderbeck, (Halberstadt,) which, however, has\r\nproduced only carnallit, since kainit has not been found there. Also\r\nat Sondershausen, potash salts have been discovered and a shaft is now\r\nsinking there.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the potash deposits extend over a wide area in\r\nGermany, and there is little fear of the deposits becoming exhausted in\r\nmany centuries. In this country no potash deposits of any commercial\r\nimportance have been discovered; but the geological conditions\r\nrequisite to these formations have not been wanting, and their future\r\ndiscovery is not improbable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17. GEOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE POTASH\r\nDEPOSITS NEAR STASSFURT.]\r\n\r\n=236. Changes in Potash Salts in Situ.=—The deposits of potash salts\r\nare not all found at the present in the same condition in which they\r\nwere first deposited from the natural brines. The layers of salt have\r\nbeen subjected to the usual upheavals and subsidences peculiar to\r\ngeological history. The layers of salt were thus tilted and the edges\r\noften brought to the surface. Here they were exposed to solution, and\r\nthe dissolved brine afterward separated its crystallizable salts in\r\nnew combinations. For instance, kieserit and the potassium chlorid of\r\nthe carnallit were first dissolved and there was left a salt compound\r\nchiefly of potassium and sodium chlorids, sylvinit. In some cases\r\nthere was a mutual reaction between the magnesium sulfate and the\r\npotassium chlorid and the magnesium potassium sulfate, schönit, was\r\nthus produced. This salt is also prepared at the mines artificially.\r\nThe most important of these secondary products however, from the\r\nagricultural standpoint, is kainit. This salt arose by the bringing\r\ntogether of potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and magnesium\r\nchlorid, and was formed everywhere about the borders of the layers of\r\ncarnallit wherever water could work upon them. In quantity the kainit,\r\nas might be supposed, is far less than the carnallit, the latter\r\nexisting in immense deposits. There is however quite enough of it to\r\nsatisfy all the demands of agriculture for an indefinite time. In fact\r\nfor many purposes the carnallit can take the place of kainit without\r\ndetriment to the growing crops. The relative positions and quantities\r\nof the layers of mineral matters in the potash mines, and the depth in\r\nmeters at which they are found is shown in Fig. 17.[197]\r\n\r\n=237. Kainit.=—The most important of the natural salts of potash for\r\nfertilizing purposes is the mixture known as kainit. It is composed\r\nin a pure state of a molecule each of potassium sulfate, magnesium\r\nsulfate, magnesium chlorid, and water. Chemically it is represented by\r\nthe symbols:\r\n\r\nK₂SO₄·MgSO₄·MgCl₂·H₂O. Its theoretical percentage of potash (K₂O),\r\noxygen = 16, is 23.2.\r\n\r\nPure kainit, however, is never found in commerce. It is mixed naturally\r\nas it comes from the mines with common salt, potassium chlorid, gypsum,\r\nand other bodies. The content of potash in the commercial salt is\r\ntherefore only a little more than half that of the pure mineral. In\r\ngeneral it may be taken at 12.5 per cent, of which more than one per\r\ncent is derived from the potassium chlorid present. The following\r\nanalysis given by Maercker may be regarded as typical:[198]\r\n\r\n    Potassium sulfate                     21.3 per cent\r\n    Magnesium    “                        14.5    “\r\n    Magnesium chlorid                     12.4    “\r\n    Potassium   “                          2.0    “\r\n    Sodium      “                         34.6    “\r\n    Calcium sulfate (gypsum)               1.7    “\r\n    Water                                 12.7    “\r\n    Alumina                                0.8    “\r\n\r\nKainit occurs as a crystalline, partly colorless, partly yellow-red\r\nmass. When ground, in which state it is sent into commerce, it forms a\r\nfine, gray-colored mass containing many small yellow and red fragments.\r\nIt is not hygroscopic and if it become moist it is due to the excess of\r\ncommon salt which it contains.\r\n\r\nAccording to Maercker kainit was formerly regarded as a potassium\r\nmagnesium sulfate. But this conception does not even apply to the pure\r\nsalt much less to that which comes from the mines. If, therefore, the\r\nagronomist desire a fertilizer free from chlorin he would be deceived\r\nin choosing kainit which may sometimes contain nearly fifty per cent of\r\nits weight of chlorids.\r\n\r\nWhere a fertilizer free of chlorin is desired, as for instance, in the\r\nculture of tobacco, kainit cannot be considered. In many other cases,\r\nhowever, the chlorin content of this body instead of being a detriment\r\nmay prove positively advantageous, the chlorids on account of their\r\neasy diffusibility through the soil serving to distribute the other\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the presence of common salt and magnesium chlorid the\r\nground kainit delivered to commerce tends to harden into compact\r\nmasses. To prevent this in Germany it is recommended to mix it with\r\nabout two and a half per cent of fine-ground dry peat.\r\n\r\nSuch a mixture is recommended in all cases where the freshly ground\r\nkainit is not to be immediately applied to the soil.\r\n\r\n=238. Carnallit.=—This mineral is a mixture of even molecules of\r\npotassium and magnesium chlorids crystallized with six molecules of\r\nwater. It is represented by the symbols KCl·MgCl₂·6H₂O. As it comes\r\nfrom the mines it contains small quantities of potassium and magnesium\r\nsulfates and small quantities of other accidental impurities. Existing\r\nas it does in immense quantities it has been extensively used for the\r\nmanufacture of the commercial potassium chlorid (muriate of potash).\r\nFor many purposes in agriculture, for instance, fertilizing tobacco\r\nfields, it is not suited, and it is less widely used as a fertilizer\r\nin general than its alteration product kainit. Its direct use as a\r\nfertilizer however is rapidly increasing since later experience has\r\nshown that chlorin compounds are capable of a far wider application\r\nin agriculture without danger of injury than was formerly supposed.\r\nAs it comes from the mines, the Stassfurt carnallit has the following\r\ncomposition:[199]\r\n\r\n    Potassium chlorid           15.5 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium    “              21.5   “  “\r\n    Magnesium sulfate           12.1   “  “\r\n    Sodium chlorid              22.4   “  “\r\n    Calcium sulfate              1.9   “  “\r\n    Water                       26.1   “  “\r\n    Undetermined                 0.5   “  “\r\n\r\nPure carnallit would have the following composition:\r\n\r\n    Chlorin                     38.3 per cent.\r\n    Potassium                   14.0   “  “\r\n    Magnesium                    8.7   “  “\r\n    Water                       39.0   “  “\r\n\r\nEquivalent to\r\n\r\n    Potassium chlorid           26.8   “  “\r\n    Magnesium  “                34.2   “  “\r\n    Water                       39.0   “  “\r\n\r\nThe commercial article as taken from the mines, as is seen above, has\r\nless potash (K₂O) than kainit, the mean content being about nine and\r\nnine-tenths per cent. Those proposing to use this body for fertilizing\r\npurposes should bear in mind that it contains less potash and more\r\nchlorin than kainit.\r\n\r\nCarnallit occurs in characteristic brown-red masses. On account of its\r\nhighly hygroscopic nature it should be kept as much as possible out\r\nof contact with moist air and should not be ground until immediately\r\nbefore using.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the greater bulk in proportion to its content of potash\r\nand its hygroscopic nature and consequent increased difficulty in\r\nhandling, the price per unit of potash in carnallit is less than in\r\nkainit.\r\n\r\nIn some localities small quantities of ammonium chlorid have been found\r\nwith carnallit but not to exceed one-tenth per cent. It has therefore\r\nno practical significance to the farmer but may be of interest to the\r\nanalyst.\r\n\r\n=239. Polyhalit.=—Polyhalit is a mineral occurring in Stassfurt\r\ndeposits and consisting of a mixture of potassium, magnesium, and\r\ncalcium sulfates, with a small proportion of crystal water. This\r\nmineral, on account of its being practically free of chlorin, would\r\nbe one especially desirable for use in those cases, as in the culture\r\nof tobacco, where chlorids are injurious. Unfortunately, it does not\r\noccur in sufficient quantities to warrant the expectation of its\r\never being found in masses large enough to become a general article\r\nof commerce. It is found only in pockets or seams among the other\r\nStassfurt deposits, and there is no assurance given on finding one of\r\nthese deposits of polyhalit that it will extend to any great distance.\r\nThe composition of the mineral is shown by the following formula:\r\nK₂SO₄·MgSO₄·(CaSO₄)₂·H₂O. Its percentage composition is shown by the\r\nfollowing numbers:\r\n\r\n    Potassium sulfate               28.90 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate               19.93  “   “\r\n    Calcium sulfate                 45.18  “   “\r\n    Water                            5.99  “   “\r\n\r\nThe percentage of potash corresponding to the above formula is 15.62.\r\nIt therefore contains a considerable excess of potash over kainit, and\r\non account of its freedom from chlorids, would be preferred for many\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n=240. Krugit.=—This mineral occurs associated with polyhalit and\r\ndiffers from it only in containing four molecules of calcium sulfate\r\ninstead of two. Its formula is: K₂SO₄·MgSO₄·(CaSO₄)₄·H₂O. As it comes\r\nfrom the mines it is frequently mixed with a little common salt. Its\r\nmean percentage composition as it comes from the mines is given in the\r\nfollowing numbers:\r\n\r\n    Potassium sulfate              18.60 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate              14.70   “  “\r\n    Calcium sulfate                61.00   “  “\r\n    Sodium chlorid                  1.50   “  “\r\n    Water                           4.20   “  “\r\n\r\nThe percentage of potash corresponding to the above formula is 10.05.\r\nIt is therefore less valuable than kainit in so far as its content of\r\npotash is concerned. This salt also exists in limited quantities and is\r\nnot likely to become an important article of commerce.\r\n\r\n=241. Sylvin.=—One of the alteration products of carnallit is a\r\npractically pure potassium chlorid which, as it occurs in the Stassfurt\r\nmines is known as sylvin. The alteration of the carnallit arises from\r\nits solution in water from which, on subsequent evaporation, the\r\npotassium chlorid is deposited alone. This mineral is found in only\r\nlimited quantities in the Stassfurt deposits and it therefore does not\r\nhave any great commercial importance.\r\n\r\n=242. Sylvinit.=—This mineral has been mined in recent years in\r\nconsiderable quantities. It is, in fact, only common salt carrying\r\nlarge quantities of potassium chlorid together with certain other\r\naccidental impurities. It was probably formed by the drying up of a\r\nsaline mass in such a way as not to permit the complete separation of\r\nits mineral constituents. The average composition of sylvinit as it\r\ncomes from the mines is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n    Potassium chlorid                    30.55 per cent.\r\n    Sodium chlorid                       46.05    “\r\n    Potassium sulfate                     6.95    “\r\n    Magnesium sulfate                     4.80    “\r\n    Magnesium chlorid                     2.54    “\r\n    Calcium sulfate                       1.80    “\r\n    Water and insoluble                   7.29    “\r\n\r\nThis salt is richer in chlorin than any other of the Stassfurt potash\r\nminerals, containing altogether 79.14 per cent of chlorids. Its potash\r\ncontent amounts to 23.04 per cent, but in proportion to the potash\r\nwhich it contains, it is relatively poorer in chlorin than kainit and\r\ncarnallit. On account of its high content of potash the freights on a\r\ngiven weight thereof as contained in sylvanit are lower than for kainit\r\nand carnallit.\r\n\r\n=243. Kieserit.=—The mineral kieserit is essentially magnesium sulfate\r\nand it does not necessarily contain any potash salts. Under the name\r\nof kieserit, however, or bergkieserit, there is mined a mixture of\r\ncarnallit and kieserit, which is a commercial source of potash. The\r\nmixture contains the following average content of the bodies named:\r\n\r\n    Potassium chlorid                    11.80 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate                    21.50    “\r\n    Magnesium chlorid                    17.20    “\r\n    Sodium chlorid                       26.70    “\r\n    Calcium sulfate                       0.80    “\r\n    Water                                20.70    “\r\n    Insoluble                             1.30    “\r\n\r\nThis mixture contains only about seven per cent of potash and would\r\nnot prove profitable when used at a distance from the mines on account\r\nof the cost of freights. It has proved valuable, however, for a top\r\ndressing for meadow lands in the vicinity of Stassfurt.\r\n\r\n=244. Schönit.=—Among the Stassfurt deposits there occurs in small\r\nquantities a mineral, schönit, which is composed of the sulfates\r\nof potassium and magnesium. The quantity of the mineral occurring\r\nnaturally is very small and therefore it has no commercial importance.\r\nWhen, however, kainit is washed with water the common salt and\r\nmagnesium chlorid which it contains being more soluble are the first\r\nleached out, and the residue has approximately the composition of the\r\npure mineral. This mixture, as prepared in the way mentioned above, has\r\nthe following average composition:\r\n\r\n    Potassium sulfate             50.40 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate             34.00    “\r\n    Sodium chlorid                 2.50    “\r\n    Water                         11.60    “\r\n\r\nThe percentage of potash corresponding to the above composition is\r\n27.2. This substance being so rich in potash, and practically free\r\nof chlorids, is well suited to transportation to great distances and\r\nfor general use in the field. Since, however, a considerable expense\r\nattends the manufacture of the artificial schönit, the advantages above\r\nnamed give it very little, if any, advantage in competition with the\r\nother potash salts as they come from the mines. It has, however, an\r\nespecial value for the fertilization of tobacco and vineyards.\r\n\r\n=245. Potassium Sulfate.=—Several grades of potassium sulfate are\r\nfound in the market for fertilizing purposes, some of them quite\r\npure, containing over ninety-seven per cent of the pure sulfate. The\r\nfollowing data show the composition of a high grade and low grade\r\npotassium sulfate of commerce:\r\n\r\n                              High grade.          Low grade.\r\n    Potassium sulfate       97.20 per cent.     90.60 per cent.\r\n    Potassium chlorid        0.30    “           1.60    “\r\n    Magnesium sulfate        0.70    “           2.70    “\r\n    Magnesium chlorid        0.40    “           1.00    “\r\n    Sodium chlorid           0.20    “           1.20    “\r\n    Insoluble                0.20    “           0.30    “\r\n    Water                    0.70    “           2.20    “\r\n\r\nNaturally, high grade sulfates of this kind can only be prepared in\r\nchemical factories built especially for the work. The result is that\r\nthe potash per unit is raised greatly in price. When, however, the\r\nfertilizers are to be transported to a great distance, the saving in\r\nfreight often more than compensates for the higher price of the potash.\r\nIt therefore happens that there are many places in this country where\r\nthe actual price of potash per pound is less in high grade sulfates\r\nthan in kainit or carnallit. When, in addition to this, the especial\r\nfitness of the high grade sulfates for certain forms of fertilization,\r\nespecially tobacco growing, is considered, it is seen that at this\r\ndistance from the mines these high grade salts are of no inconsiderable\r\nimportance. The percentage of potash in the high grade sulfates often\r\nexceeds fifty.\r\n\r\n=246. Potassium Magnesium Carbonate.=—This salt has lately been\r\nmanufactured and used to a considerable extent, especially for tobacco\r\nfertilizing. As furnished to the trade it has the following average\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n    Potassium carbonate                     35 to 40 per cent.\r\n    Magnesium carbonate                     33 to 36    “\r\n    Water of crystallization                      25    “\r\n    Potassium chlorid, potassium sulfate,\r\n      and insoluble                          2 to  3    “\r\n\r\nThe content of potash, as is seen from the above formula, amounts to\r\nfrom seventeen to eighteen per cent. The compound is completely dry,\r\nis not hygroscopic, and is, therefore, always ready for distribution.\r\nIt is especially to be recommended for all those intensive cultures\r\nwhere it is feared that chlorids and sulfates will prove injurious,\r\nespecially in the cultivation of tobacco.\r\n\r\n=247. Potash in Factory Residues.=—The residues from the potash\r\nfactories in Stassfurt and vicinity contain considerable quantities\r\nof potash and attempts have been made to recover this waste and put\r\nit into form for fertilizing uses. The waste waters of the factories\r\nare sometimes collected and evaporated, and the residue incinerated.\r\nThe content of potash in these residues is extremely variable, usually\r\nquite low, and they, therefore, cannot be recommended for fertilizing\r\npurposes, especially if they are to be transported to any distance.\r\n\r\n=248. Quantity of Potash Salts Used.=—The total quantity of potash\r\ndelivered to consumers from the Stassfurt mines in 1891, the last\r\nyear for which complete statistics are at hand was 413,508 tons of\r\nkainit and sylvinit, 39,444 tons of carnallit, 18,078 tons of sulfate,\r\nand 12,453 tons of the potassium magnesium sulfate. Of the above\r\nquantities, 115,245 tons of kainit were shipped to North America, and\r\nof the high grade sulfate mentioned, 13,322 tons were sent to other\r\ncountries, and of the potassium magnesium sulfate, 11,081 tons were\r\nexported.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n=249. Classification of Methods.=—To detect the presence of potash in\r\na mixture the aid of the spectroscope may be invoked. In the scale of\r\nthe spectrum divided into 170 parts, on which the sodium line falls at\r\n50, potassium gives three faint rather broad bands, two red, falling\r\nat 17 and 27, and one plum-colored band, near the extreme right of\r\nthe spectrum, at 153. Potassium, however, does not give brilliant and\r\nwell-marked spectral bands, such as are afforded by its associates\r\nrubidium, caesium, sodium, and lithium. A convenient qualitative test\r\nwhich, for practical purposes will be quite sufficient, may be secured\r\nby dipping a platinum loop into a strong acid solution of the supposed\r\npotash compound, and viewing through a piece of cobalt glass, the\r\ncoloration produced thereby when held in the flame of a bunsen. The\r\nred-purple tint thereby produced should be compared with that coming\r\nfrom a pure potash salt similarly treated. If a fertilizer sample\r\ngive no indication of potash when treated as above it may be safely\r\nconcluded that it does not contain any weighable quantity of potash.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of the percentage of potash present in a given\r\nsample it may be safely assumed that all of value in agriculture will\r\nbe given up to an aqueous or slightly acid solution if organic matter\r\nhave been destroyed as indicated in a previous paragraph. In the case\r\nof minerals insoluble in a dilute acid the potash may be determined by\r\nsome one of the processes given in the first volume.[200] The potash\r\nhaving been obtained in an aqueous or slightly acid (hydrochloric)\r\nsolution, it may be determined either by precipitation as potassium\r\nplatinochlorid or as potassium perchlorate. The former method is the\r\none which has been almost exclusively used by analysis in the past, but\r\nthe latter one is coming into prominence and by reason of the greater\r\neconomy attending its practice and the excellent results obtained by\r\nsome analysts, demands a generous consideration.\r\n\r\n=250. The Platinic Chlorid Method.=—The principle of this method\r\nrests on the great insolubility of the potassium platinochlorid\r\nin strong alcohol and the easy solubility of some of its commonly\r\nattending salts; _viz._, sodium, etc., in the same reagent. Before the\r\nprecipitation of the potash it is necessary to remove the bases of the\r\nearths, sulfates, etc. Barium chlorid and hydroxid, ammonium oxalate or\r\ncarbonate, sulfuric acid, etc., are used in conjunction or successively\r\nto effect these purposes in the manner hereinafter described. The\r\nfiltrate and washings containing the potash are evaporated to dryness\r\nand gently ignited to expel excess of ammonium salts and in the residue\r\ntaken up with water and acidulated with hydrochloric acid, the potash\r\nis precipitated with platinic chlorid solution. The best methods of\r\nexecuting the analysis follow.\r\n\r\n=251. The Official Agricultural Method.=—This method is based on the\r\nprocesses at first proposed by Lindo[201] and Gladding,[202] and\r\nis given below as adapted to mixed fertilizers and mineral potash\r\nsalts.[203]\r\n\r\n(1) _In Superphosphates._—Boil ten grams with 300 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater thirty minutes. To the hot solution add ammonia in slight excess,\r\nand then a sufficient quantity of ammonium oxalate to precipitate all\r\nthe lime present; cool and make up to half a liter, mix thoroughly,\r\nand filter through a dry filter; evaporate fifty cubic centimeters,\r\ncorresponding to one gram, nearly to dryness, add one cubic centimeter\r\nof dilute sulfuric acid (1 to 1), evaporate to dryness and ignite to\r\nwhiteness. As all the potash is in form of sulfate, no loss need be\r\napprehended by volatilization of potash, and a full red heat must\r\nbe maintained until the residue is perfectly white. This residue\r\nis dissolved in hot water, plus a few drops of hydrochloric acid,\r\nand a slight excess of platinum solution is added. This solution is\r\nthen evaporated to a thick paste in a small dish, and eighty per\r\ncent alcohol added. In evaporating, special precaution should be\r\ntaken to prevent absorption of ammonia. The precipitate is washed\r\nthoroughly with alcohol by decantation and on the filter, as usual.\r\nThe washing should be continued even after the filtrate is colorless.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of the ammonium chlorid solution, prepared as\r\nhereinafter directed, are run through the filter, or the washing may\r\nbe performed in the dish. The ten cubic centimeters will contain the\r\nbulk of the impurities, and are thrown away. Fresh portions of ten\r\ncubic centimeters of the ammonium chlorid are run through the filter\r\nseveral times (5 or 6). The filter is then washed thoroughly with pure\r\nalcohol, dried, and weighed as usual. Care should be taken that the\r\nprecipitate is perfectly soluble in water. The platinum solution used\r\ncontains one gram of metallic platinum in every ten cubic centimeters.\r\nTo prepare the washing solution of ammonium chlorid, place in a bottle\r\n500 cubic centimeters of water and 100 grams of ammonium chlorid and\r\nshake till dissolved. Now pulverize five or ten grains of potassium\r\nplatinochlorid, put in the bottle and shake at intervals for six or\r\neight hours; let settle over night, then filter off the liquid into\r\na second bottle. The first bottle is then ready for preparation of a\r\nfresh supply when needed.\r\n\r\n(2) _Potassium Chlorids._—In the analysis of these salts an aliquot\r\nportion of the solution, containing a half gram, is evaporated with\r\nforty cubic centimeters of the platinum solution and a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid, and washed as before.\r\n\r\n(3) _Potassium Sulfate, Kainit, Etc._—In the analysis of kainit,\r\ndissolve ten grams of the pulverized salt in 300 cubic centimeters of\r\nboiling water, add ammonia to slight excess, then a sufficient quantity\r\nof ammonium oxalate to throw down all lime present; cool and make up\r\nto half a liter, mix thoroughly, and filter on a dry filter; from\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters, corresponding to a half gram, proceed\r\nto remove the ammonia, as in the analysis of superphosphates; dissolve\r\nthe residue in hot water, plus a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and\r\nadd fifteen cubic centimeters of platinum solution. In the analysis\r\nof high-grade sulfate and of double-manure salt (potassium sulfate,\r\nmagnesium sulfate, containing about twenty-seven per cent of potassium\r\noxid), make up the solution as above, but omit the precipitation,\r\nevaporation, etc.; to an aliquot part equal to a half gram add fifteen\r\ncubic centimeters of platinum solution. In all cases special care\r\nmust be taken in the washing with alcohol to remove all the double\r\nplatinum sodium chlorid which may be present. The washing should be\r\ncontinued some time after the filtrate is colorless. Twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the ammonium chlorid solution are employed instead of\r\nten cubic centimeters, and the twenty-five cubic centimeters poured\r\nthrough at least six times to remove all sulfates and chlorids. Wash\r\nfinally with alcohol; dry and weigh as usual.\r\n\r\n=252. Alternate Method for Potash.=—Boil ten grams of the prepared\r\nsample for thirty minutes with 300 cubic centimeters of water, and,\r\nafter cooling and without filtering, make up to one liter and filter\r\nthrough a dry filter. If the sample have ten per cent of potassium\r\noxid, use fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate; if less than ten per\r\ncent of potassium oxid (ordinary potash fertilizers), use 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate. In each case make the volume up to 150\r\ncubic centimeters, heat to 100°, and add, drop by drop with constant\r\nstirring, a slight excess of barium chlorid, and, without filtering,\r\nin the same manner add barium hydrate in slight excess. Filter while\r\nhot and wash until the precipitate is free of chlorids. Add to the\r\nfiltrate one cubic centimeter of strong ammonium hydrate, and then a\r\nsaturated solution of ammonium carbonate, until the excess of barium is\r\nprecipitated. Heat and add, in fine powder, a half gram of pure oxalic\r\nacid or 0.75 gram of ammonium oxalate. Filter, wash free of chlorids,\r\nevaporate the filtrate to dryness in a platinum dish, and ignite\r\ncarefully over the free flame, below red heat, until all volatile\r\nmatter is driven off.\r\n\r\nThe residue is digested with hot water, filtered through a small\r\nfilter, and washed with successive small portions of water until the\r\nfiltrate amounts to thirty cubic centimeters or more. To this filtrate,\r\nadd two drops of hydrochloric acid, in a porcelain dish, and from five\r\nto ten cubic centimeters of a solution of ten grams of platinic chlorid\r\nin 100 cubic centimeters of water. The mixture is evaporated on a\r\nwater-bath to a thick sirup, as above, treated with alcohol of eighty\r\nper cent strength, washed by decantation, collected in a gooch or other\r\nform of filter, washed with strong alcohol, afterwards with five cubic\r\ncentimeters of ether, dried for thirty minutes at 100°, and weighed.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable, if there be an appearance of foreign matter in the\r\ndouble salt, that it should be washed, according to the previous\r\nmethod, with ten cubic centimeters of the half-concentrated solution of\r\nammonium chlorid, which has been saturated by shaking with potassium\r\nplatinochlorid.\r\n\r\n=253. Method of Solution for Organic Compounds.=—In case the potash is\r\ncontained in organic compounds, like tobacco stems, cottonseed hulls,\r\netc., weigh ten grams, saturate with strong sulfuric acid, and ignite\r\nin a muffle to destroy organic matter. Add a little strong hydrochloric\r\nacid to moisten the mass and warm slightly so as to loosen it in the\r\ndish. Proceed then as in the lindo-gladding or alternate method.\r\n\r\n=254. Factors.=—The use of the factors 0.3056 for converting potassium\r\nplatinochlorid to potassium chlorid and 0.19308 for converting it to\r\npotassium oxid is advised. The latter number is almost identical with\r\nthat used by the Halle and Stassfurt chemists _viz._, 0.1927 and 0.1928\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n=255. Methods Used at the Halle Station.=—(1) _In Kainits and other\r\nMineral Salts of Potash._[204]—Five grams of the prepared sample are\r\nboiled for half an hour in a half liter flask with from twenty to\r\nthirty cubic centimeters of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 100\r\ncubic centimeters of water, and afterwards as much water added as is\r\nnecessary to fill the flask about three quarters full, and the sulfuric\r\nacid is then precipitated with barium chlorid. To avoid an excess of\r\nbarium chlorid the solution used is of known strength and is added\r\nfirst in such quantity as would precipitate the sulfuric acid from\r\na kainit of low sulfuric acid content. The mixture is then boiled,\r\nallowed to settle and tried with a dropping tube containing barium\r\nchlorid. If a further precipitate be given a few drops more of barium\r\nchlorid solution are added, again boiled and allowed to settle. This\r\nis continued until barium chlorid gives no precipitation. After the\r\nbarium chlorid gives no more precipitate a drop of dilute sulfuric acid\r\nis added to test for excess of barium. The operation is continued with\r\nthe sulfuric acid until it no longer gives a precipitate of barium\r\nsulfate. By the alternate use of the barium chlorid and sulfuric acid\r\nthe exact neutral point can soon be secured. When this point is reached\r\nthe liquid is allowed to cool, the flask is filled to the mark, its\r\ncontents filtered, and of the filtrate fifty cubic centimeters, equal\r\nto half a gram of the substance, taken for further estimation.\r\n\r\nThis quantity is evaporated on a water-bath to a sirupy consistence\r\nin a porcelain dish with ten cubic centimeters of platinic chlorid.\r\nThe platinic chlorid solution should contain one gram of platinum\r\nin each ten cubic centimeters. The residue is treated with eighty\r\nper cent alcohol and, with stirring, allowed to stand for an hour.\r\nThe precipitate is then collected on a gooch, either of platinum or\r\nporcelain, washed about eight times with eighty per cent alcohol\r\nand the potassium platinochlorid dried for two hours at 100°. After\r\nweighing the precipitate is dissolved in hot water and the residue\r\nwashed under pressure, first with hot water and then with alcohol.\r\nThe crucible with the asbestos felt is dried at 100° and weighed. Any\r\nimpurities which the double salt may have carried down with it are\r\nleft on the filter and the weight of the original precipitate can thus\r\nbe corrected. The weight of potassium platinochlorid is multiplied by\r\n0.1927 and the product corresponds to the weight of K₂O in the sample\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n(2) _Estimation of Potash in Guanos and Other Fertilizers containing\r\nOrganic Substances._—Ten grams of the substances are carefully\r\nincinerated at a low temperature in a platinum dish. After ignition\r\nthe contents of the dish are placed in a half liter flask and boiled\r\nfor an hour with hydrochloric acid and a few drops of nitric acid. The\r\nsulfuric acid can then be precipitated directly with barium chlorid, or\r\nbetter, allow the flask to cool, fill to the mark, filter and treat an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate with barium chlorid as described above.\r\nThe filtrate from the separated sulfate of barium is neutralized with\r\nammonia and all the bases, with the exception of magnesia and the\r\nalkalies, precipitated with ammonium carbonate; boil, fill to the\r\nmark and filter. Of this filtrate evaporate from 100 to 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters in a platinum dish. After evaporation the ammonium salts\r\nare driven off by careful ignition, the residue taken up with hot water\r\nand filtered through as small a filter as possible into a porcelain\r\ndish; the magnesia remaining in the precipitate. The filtrate is\r\nacidified with a few drops of hydrochloric acid, ten cubic centimeters\r\nof platinic chlorid added and the further determination conducted as\r\nwith kainit.\r\n\r\n=256. Dutch Method.=—The process used at the Royal Agricultural Station\r\nof Holland is almost identical with that employed at Halle.[205]\r\n\r\nA. _Method for Stassfurt and other Potash Salts._—The necessary\r\nreagents are:\r\n\r\n1. A dilute solution of barium chlorid:\r\n\r\n2. A solution of platinic chlorid containing one gram of platinum in\r\nten cubic centimeters: It must be wholly free from platinous chlorid\r\nand nitric acid, and partially freed from an excess of hydrochloric\r\nacid by repeated evaporations with water.\r\n\r\n3. Alcohol of eighty per cent strength by the volume:\r\n\r\nThe methods of bringing the potash into solution and of precipitating\r\nthe sulfuric acid are the same as for the Halle process described above.\r\n\r\nAdd then twenty cubic centimeters of the platinum solution and\r\nevaporate the mixture nearly to dryness. Add a sufficient quantity of\r\neighty per cent alcohol and stir for some time. Allow to stand and then\r\nfilter through a gooch dried at 120°. Finally wash with eighty per cent\r\nalcohol, dry at 120°, and weigh.\r\n\r\nB. _Method for Potash Superphosphate and other mixed Fertilizers._—The\r\nreagents necessary are the same as under A, and, in addition, a\r\nsaturated solution of barium hydrate and a solution of ammonium\r\ncarbonate mixed with ammonia.\r\n\r\nBoil twenty grams of the substance with water for half an hour, cool,\r\nmake up to half a liter and filter. Boil fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nthe filtrate, and add barium chlorid till no more precipitate forms.\r\nMix with baryta water to strong alkaline reaction, cool, make up to\r\n100 cubic centimeters and filter. Raise fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate to the boiling temperature and add ammonium carbonate solution\r\ntill no more precipitate forms: Cool, make up to 100 cubic centimeters\r\nand filter. Transfer fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate to a\r\nplatinum dish, evaporate and heat the residue, avoiding too high a\r\ntemperature, till the ammonia salts are expelled. Dissolve the residue\r\nin water, filter, and treat the filtrate as described under A.\r\n\r\n=257. Swedish Methods.=—The Swedish chemists determine the potash\r\nin mineral salts by the platinum chlorid process, but with certain\r\nvariations from the processes already given. The manipulation is\r\nconducted as follows:[206]\r\n\r\nWeigh one gram of the sample to be examined and pour about 300 cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot water over it in a beaker and filter after complete\r\nsolution; add one cubic centimeter of hydrochloric acid, heat nearly\r\nto boiling, add dilute barium chlorid solution from a pipette or\r\nburette in a very fine stream stirring, slowly and carefully, till\r\nall sulfuric acid is completely precipitated, and only a trace of the\r\nprecipitant is in excess. If the precipitation be conducted in the\r\nway given the barium sulfate will come down in crystalline condition,\r\nand settle rapidly within a few minutes, and almost immediately after\r\nthe precipitation is finished may be filtered clear. The filtrate and\r\nwashings from the barium sulfate are brought into a liter flask; fill\r\nthis to the mark, take out fifty cubic centimeters with a pipette,\r\nevaporate the greater portion on a water-bath in a porcelain dish,\r\ntransfer the residue by means of ammonia-free water to a beaker of\r\nfifty cubic centimeters capacity, add ten cubic centimeters of platinic\r\nchlorid solution, stir well with a glass rod, evaporate on a water-bath\r\nto a sirupy condition, allow to cool, and if the residue be too dry,\r\nadd a few drops of water to allow the sodium platinochlorid to take\r\nup crystal water with certainty, stir well, add alcohol after a few\r\nminutes, mix carefully, leave the mixture standing for a while in the\r\nbeaker covered with a watch glass, stirring occasionally; finally\r\ndecant the solution, which must be of a dark yellow color, through a\r\nvery small filter, wash the precipitate in the beaker repeatedly with\r\nsmall quantities of alcohol and decant; then transfer the precipitate\r\nto the filter, wash with alcohol, dry the filter and the precipitate\r\nat a gentle heat till all alcohol has evaporated, carefully transfer\r\nthe contents of the filter to a watch glass placed on white glazed\r\npaper; dissolve the potassium platinochlorid still remaining on the\r\nfilter in small quantities of boiling water, evaporate the filtrate\r\non a water-bath in an accurately weighed platinum dish to dryness\r\nand transfer the same to the main portion of the chlorid from the\r\nwatch glass. In order to obtain the salt free of the corresponding\r\ncombinations of sodium, barium, calcium, and magnesium, which salts,\r\nalthough soluble in alcohol, may make the salt impure, before weighing,\r\ntreat the precipitate twice with small quantities of cold water which\r\nwill dissolve these impurities; evaporate the solution after addition\r\nof one cubic centimeter of platinic chlorid nearly to dryness on a\r\nwater-bath, treat the residue in the same way as given before, add the\r\nsmall quantity of potassium platinochlorid which is hereby obtained\r\ntogether with the main portion to the platinum dish, dry at 130°, and\r\nweigh. Only after having been treated in this way may the precipitated\r\npotassium platinochlorid be considered absolutely pure. The Stassfurt\r\nsalts contain magnesia, often in large quantities and as a consequence\r\nthe potassium platinochlorid precipitated directly is likely to be\r\ncontaminated therewith.\r\n\r\n=258. Methods for the Analysis of Carnallit, Kainit, Sylvinit, and\r\nKieserit.=—The chemists of the German Potash Syndicate use the\r\nfollowing methods in the analysis of the raw products mentioned\r\nabove.[207]\r\n\r\n(1) _Preparation of the Sample._—It is advisable to take from a large\r\nwell mixed mass at least half a kilogram for the analytical sample and\r\nthis should be ground to a fine powder in a mill or mortar.\r\n\r\n(2) _Estimation of the Potash by the Precipitation Method._—In a half\r\nliter flask are placed 35.70 grams of kainit or sylvinit, or 30.56\r\ngrams of carnallit or bergkieserit, which are boiled with 350 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water after the addition of ten cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid. After cooling the flask is filled to the mark with\r\nwater, well shaken, and its contents filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate are treated in a 200 cubic centimeter flask with a\r\nsolution of barium chlorid, the flask filled to the mark, well shaken,\r\nand its contents filtered. Twenty cubic centimeters of the filtrate,\r\ncorresponding to 0.3570 or 0.3056 gram of the substance, are treated\r\nwith five cubic centimeters of platinic chlorid solution and the\r\npotassium estimated according to the usual methods.\r\n\r\n(3) _Estimation of Potash (K₂O) in Raw Potash Salts._—(_a_) For the\r\ndetermination of potash alone in carnallit, kainit, and sylvinit\r\none hundred grams of the well-mixed sample are put into a graduated\r\nflask holding one liter and dissolved by boiling with half a liter\r\nof water, acidulated with ten cubic centimeters of hydrochloric. The\r\npurpose of adding hydrochloric acid is to bring any polyhalit that\r\nmight be present in the salts into solution and which it is difficult\r\nto dissolve in pure water. After dissolving and cooling the flask is\r\nfilled up to the mark. The solution, after mixing, is filtered through\r\na dry filter and 100 cubic centimeters of the filtrate, corresponding\r\nto ten grams substance, are put into a half liter flask by means of\r\na pipette. After the addition of 200-300 cubic centimeters of water\r\nthe solution is heated to boiling and the sulfuric acid accurately\r\nprecipitated with normal barium chlorid solution, containing 104\r\ngrams of the dry salt in one liter. The volume of the precipitate\r\nis calculated from the amount of barium solution used and from the\r\nspecific gravity of the barium sulfate. After cooling, the flask is\r\nfilled up with water as far above the mark as equals the volume of the\r\ncalculated barium precipitate, and, after thorough mixing, the solution\r\nis filtered again through a dry filter. Fifty cubic centimeters of this\r\nfiltrate, corresponding to one gram substance, are evaporated upon the\r\nwater-bath with a sufficient amount of platinic chlorid. The residue of\r\npotassium platinochlorid is washed with ninety per cent alcohol, dried\r\nat 120°, and weighed.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If it be desired to determine separately the quantity of\r\npotash present in the form of sulfate and in the form of chlorid,\r\nas for example in kainit and in sulfate of potash, or if it is to\r\nbe determined whether potassium sulfate is in combination with a\r\nproportionate amount of magnesium chlorid, as in kainit, or in\r\ncombination with magnesium sulfate alone, as in schönit, it then\r\nbecomes necessary to determine besides potash the percentages of\r\nchlorin, sulfuric acid, lime, magnesia, the total alkalies, water,\r\nand the residue insoluble in water. For this purpose 100 grams of the\r\nsample are dissolved, the solution is filtered, the filter washed,\r\nand the filtrate made up to one liter; a part of the liquid is taken\r\nfor the determination of sulfuric acid; by precipitating with barium\r\nchlorid, and another part for the determination of lime and magnesia.\r\nFor the determination of the alkali chlorids, 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof the solution, corresponding to ten grams substance, are acidulated\r\nwith hydrochloric, and, after heating to boiling, the sulfuric acid\r\nis completely precipitated with barium chlorid, with the precaution\r\nof using not more of the barium solution than is necessary for the\r\ncomplete precipitation. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtered\r\nsolution, corresponding to one gram substance, are evaporated to\r\ndryness in order to drive off the hydrochloric acid. Magnesium chlorid\r\nis decomposed by igniting with oxalic acid or with mercuric oxid. After\r\nignition, the residue is moistened with a little ammonium carbonate for\r\nthe purpose of converting the calcium oxid that may have been formed\r\ninto calcium carbonate. The alkali chlorids, which are entirely free\r\nof lime and magnesia, are weighed, and potassium chlorid is determined\r\nby means of platinic chlorid. The amount of sodium chlorid is obtained\r\nby deducting potassium chlorid from the mixed chlorids. For the water\r\ndetermination five grams of the sample are ignited and the loss of\r\nweight is determined. The ignited mass is dissolved in water, and for\r\nthe purpose of determining the quantity of magnesium chlorid that may\r\nhave been decomposed by the ignition the percentage of chlorin is\r\ndetermined by titration. The difference in the contents of chlorin\r\nbefore and after ignition is subtracted from the loss in weight, after\r\nallowance has been made for the absorption of oxygen and for the loss\r\nof hydrogen. The rest is water. The results obtained are calculated in\r\nthe following manner: From the total amount of the sulfuric acid found,\r\nthat portion is deducted which is combined with calcium as calcium\r\nsulfate; the rest of the sulfuric acid is divided into two equal parts\r\nfor the purpose of calculating the contents of potassium sulfate and\r\nmagnesium sulfate, according to the molecular proportion in which these\r\nsalts are present in kainit and in schönit. If there be an excess of\r\npotash left uncombined with sulfuric acid, then it is in the form of\r\npotassium chlorid; likewise the amount of magnesia, uncombined with\r\nsulfuric acid, is to be reckoned as magnesium chlorid. The result of\r\nthis calculation will tell how much potash is in the form of kainit\r\n(K₂SO₄, MgSO₄, MgCl₂ with 6H₂O) and how much of it is in the form of\r\nschönit (K₂SO₄, MgSO₄, with 6H₂O) and how much in the form of potassium\r\nchlorid. The sodium is reckoned as sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In calculating the contents of potash, of potassium chlorid, and\r\nof potassium sulfate from the weighed potassium platinochlorid, the\r\nfactors 0.1928, 0.3056, and 0.3566 are used, assuming that the atomic\r\nweight of platinum is 197.18.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The two methods which have been described under _a_ and _b_, and\r\nwhich are in common use in the Stassfurt potash industry, _i. e._, the\r\nso-called precipitation method, and the oxalic acid method, give almost\r\nidentical results. The first method, however, deserves preference on\r\naccount of greater simplicity in cases where potash alone is to be\r\ndetermined. Finkner’s method likewise gives results which agree well\r\nwith the results obtained by the customary methods. It consists in\r\nevaporating the salt solution with a sufficient quantity of platinic\r\nchlorid without previously removing the sulfuric acid, reducing the\r\npotassium platinochlorid, and weighing the metallic platinum.\r\n\r\nThe following are the results of comparative analyses:\r\n\r\n    1. After the precipitation method      22.02 per cent KCl\r\n    2. After the oxalic acid method        22.03 per cent KCl\r\n    3. After Finkner’s method              22.01 per cent KCl\r\n\r\nIn another sample of carnallit the following results were obtained:\r\n\r\n    1. After the precipitation method      17.88 per cent KCl\r\n    2. After the oxalic acid method        17.88 per cent KCl\r\n\r\nIn a third sample of carnallit the content of potassium chlorid was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. After the precipitation method      18.44 per cent\r\n    2. After the oxalic acid method        18.38 per cent\r\n\r\nThe Anhalt chemists object to precipitating the sulfuric acid and\r\nalkaline earths with barium oxid and ammonium carbonate, and afterwards\r\nthe potash with platinic chlorid. The results obtained with this method\r\nare, according to them, very inaccurate, and always too low. This is\r\nexplained by the fact that it is impossible to precipitate sulfuric\r\nacid without at the same time precipitating some of the potash, unless\r\nit be in an acid solution.\r\n\r\nA separation of the alkaline earths, if potash alone is to be\r\ndetermined, is superfluous, for the reason that calcium and magnesium\r\nplatinochlorid are soluble in ninety per cent alcohol, even with more\r\nfacility than sodium platinochlorid.\r\n\r\n=259. Methods for Concentrated Potash Salts.=—In the preceding\r\nparagraphs have been given the methods used by the Stassfurt syndicate\r\nfor the estimation of potash in the raw salts as they come from the\r\nmines. Following are the methods used by the same syndicate for the\r\nconcentrated approximately pure compounds and the other salts which\r\naccompany them.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Chlorid._—The following process is used for the estimation\r\nof potassium and other constituents of the high grade chlorids of\r\ncommerce. In a half liter flask are placed 7.6405 grams of the finely\r\npowdered sample, which is dissolved and made up to the mark. With\r\nsalts which contain more than half a per cent of sulfuric acid the\r\npreliminary conversion of the sulfates into the corresponding chlorin\r\ncompounds, by precipitation with barium chlorid solution, is necessary.\r\nTwenty cubic centimeters of the above solution, corresponding to\r\n0.3056 gram of the salt, are placed in a flat porcelain dish having\r\na diameter of about ten centimeters and, after the addition of five\r\ncubic centimeters of the platinic chlorid solution, evaporated on\r\nthe water-bath with constant stirring until, after cooling, the\r\nsirupy liquid passes quickly into a fine crystalline condition. The\r\nresidue is rubbed into a fine powder with a glass rod, mixed with\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of ninety-six per cent alcohol and dried at\r\n120° to a constant weight. It is weighed while warm and brought on\r\na moistened filter with alcohol, care being taken that the liquid\r\ndoes not touch the edge of the filter. The filtration can be carried\r\non under a moderate pressure. The complete washing of the potassium\r\nplatinochlorid can be easily accomplished upon the filter. The filter\r\nand the precipitate, after as much of the alcohol wash has been removed\r\nas is possible, are dried at 120° to constant weight and weighed while\r\nstill warm. One milligram of the potassium platinochlorid thus obtained\r\ncorresponds to a tenth per cent of potassium chlorid.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Sodium Chlorid._—For the estimation of the sodium\r\nchlorid which may be present in the potassium chlorid twelve and a half\r\ngrams of the latter salt are dissolved in a quarter liter flask with\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of boiling water after the addition of a\r\nlittle potassium carbonate for the purpose of converting the magnesium\r\nand calcium compounds into carbonates. After filtration 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters corresponding to five grams of the salt are evaporated to\r\ndryness in a porcelain or platinum dish after the addition of a few\r\ndrops of concentrated hydrochloric acid in order to convert any calcium\r\ncarbonate which may be present into chlorid. The residue is gently\r\nignited and weighed. In this mixture of potassium and sodium chlorids\r\nthe potassium chlorid may be estimated in the usual way and the sodium\r\nchlorid determined by difference or the respective proportions of\r\nthe two bases may be calculated after the determination of the total\r\nchlorin by precipitation with a standard solution of silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Magnesium Chlorid._—In order to estimate the amount of\r\nmagnesium chlorid in high grade muriate of potash, twenty-five grams\r\nof the latter salt are dissolved in a half liter flask and treated\r\nwith ten cubic centimeters of a normal solution of potash lye. The\r\nflask is then filled to the mark with water, thoroughly shaken and its\r\ncontents filtered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate are then\r\ntitrated with one-tenth normal sulfuric acid. The calcium compounds\r\nwhich remain in solution do not influence the result. The quantity\r\nof magnesium chlorid originally present corresponds to the number of\r\ncubic centimeters of the normal potash lye which has disappeared in\r\nthe operation. The reaction which takes place is represented by the\r\nfollowing equation:\r\n\r\n    MgCl₂ + 2KOH = MgO₂H₂ + 2KCl.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Sulfate._—The quantity of potassium sulfate contained in the\r\nhigh grade sulfates of commerce is determined in the following manner:\r\nIn a half liter flask are placed 8.9235 grams of the finely ground\r\nsample which is dissolved in about 350 cubic centimeters of boiling\r\nwater after the addition of twenty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid. The sulfuric acid is thrown out by the addition, drop by drop, of\r\na barium chlorid solution, the contents of the flask being kept boiling\r\nmeanwhile and thoroughly stirred. From time to time the addition\r\nof the barium chlorid is stopped and the upper part of the liquid\r\nallowed to become clear by the subsidence of the barium sulfate. It is\r\nthen noticed whether or not an additional drop of the barium chlorid\r\nsolution produces a turbidity. Any excess of barium chlorid is removed\r\nby the careful addition of sulfuric acid. After the precipitation is\r\ncomplete and the contents of the flask are cooled, it is filled up to\r\nthe mark with water and its contents filtered. Twenty cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate, corresponding to 0.357 gram of the original salt are\r\nprecipitated by platinic chlorid in the usual manner and the resulting\r\npotassium platinochlorid collected and weighed. One milligram of the\r\npotassium platinochlorid thus obtained corresponds to one-tenth per\r\ncent of potassium sulfate in the original salt. To the percentage of\r\npotassium sulfate thus found three-tenths per cent are to be added for\r\na correction when high grade potassium sulfate is taken. If the sample\r\nbe a high grade sulfate of potassium and magnesium no correction should\r\nbe applied.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Potassium Chlorid and Potassium Sulfate in Calcined\r\nManurial Salts._—In these salts 15.281 grams for potassium chlorid\r\nor 17.847 grams for potassium sulfate are dissolved in a half liter\r\nflask after the addition of ten cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid. The flask is filled to the mark and its contents filtered and\r\n250 cubic centimeters placed in a half liter flask and treated with\r\nbarium chlorid solution as indicated above. The rest of the operation\r\nis exactly as has been described. In each case one milligram of the\r\npotassium platinochlorid corresponds to one-tenth per cent of the\r\ndesired salt.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Magnesium Sulfate in Kieserit._—Ten grams of the finely\r\npowdered kieserit are boiled for one hour in a half liter flask\r\ntwo-thirds full of water. After cooling, from fifty to sixty cubic\r\ncentimeters of double normal potash lye and twenty cubic centimeters of\r\na ten per cent neutral potassium oxalate solution are added, the flask\r\nfilled to the mark, and after being well shaken and standing for a\r\nquarter of an hour, filtered. The reaction is represented by the formula\r\n\r\n    MgSO₄ + 2KOH = MgO₂H₂ + K₂SO₄.\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of the filtrate are then titrated with\r\none-tenth normal sulfuric acid. To the percentage of magnesium sulfate\r\nfound by this process two-tenths per cent are to be added as a\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\n_Barium Chlorid Solution._—Dissolve 122 grams of crystallized barium\r\nchlorid in water in a liter flask. Add fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid and water to the mark and shake well.\r\n\r\n=260. The Barium Oxalate Method.=—The principle of this process, worked\r\nout by Schweitzer and Lungwitz[208] is based on the fact that in an\r\nammoniacal solution, by means of barium oxalate, all the alkaline\r\nearths can be precipitated as oxalates, and sulfuric acid in similar\r\ncircumstances can be thrown down as a barium salt and the iron and\r\nalumina as hydroxids. The reagents used to secure this precipitation\r\nare ammonia and barium oxalate.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of potash in a superphosphate the analytical\r\nprocess is conducted as follows: Ten grams of the superphosphate are\r\nmixed with half a liter of water and fifteen grams of barium oxalate\r\ndissolved in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is boiled for twenty minutes and treated with some hydrogen\r\nperoxid to oxidize any ferrous iron that may be present. Afterwards\r\nthe solution is made alkaline with ammonia. After cooling, it is made\r\nup to a given volume (half a liter) and filtered. An aliquot part of\r\nthe filtrate is evaporated to dryness, ignited, extracted with hot\r\nwater and, after the addition of a few drops of hydrochloric acid, the\r\npotassium is precipitated with platinic chlorid, and collected and\r\nweighed in the usual manner: Or the ignited residue may be dissolved\r\ndirectly in dilute hydrochloric acid and the rest of the process\r\ncarried out as indicated.\r\n\r\nIn kainit the process is conducted as follows: Ten grams of the\r\npowdered sample are treated with a hydrochloric acid solution of the\r\nbarium oxalate containing ten grams of the salt. The rest of the\r\noperation is conducted as described above. In the use of this method\r\nit is important that always enough of the barium oxalate solution be\r\nemployed to fully saturate all the sulfuric acid which may be present.\r\n\r\n=261. Method of DeRoode for Kainit.=—All the potash contained\r\nin kainit, according to de Roode, passes readily into aqueous\r\nsolution.[209] On evaporating this aqueous solution to a pasty\r\ncondition with enough platinic chlorid to unite with all the halogens\r\npresent all the other bodies can be washed out of the potassium\r\nplatinochlorid by ammonium chlorid solution and the pure platinum salt\r\nthus obtained, which is washed and dried in the usual way. De Roode\r\ntherefore asserts that it is quite useless to previously precipitate\r\nthe solution of kainit with barium chlorid, ammonium oxalate, or\r\ncarbonate. Before the addition of alcohol to the residue obtained by\r\nevaporation with platinic chlorid the sodium sulfate present renders\r\nthe platinum salt sticky and difficult to wash, but the disturbing\r\nsodium compound can be readily removed by washing with ammonium chlorid\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe method of direct treatment has the advantage of avoiding the\r\nocclusion of potash in other precipitates and the danger of loss on\r\nignition. The method as used by de Roode gives results about one-tenth\r\nper cent higher than are obtained by the official processes.\r\n\r\n=262. The Calcium Chlorid Method.=—Huston has proposed the addition of\r\ncalcium chlorid to the solution of a fertilizer in the determination\r\nof potash, in order to furnish sufficient calcium to form tricalcium\r\nphosphate with all the phosphoric acid present, and thereby permit\r\nof the use of platinum dishes in the lindo-gladding method.[210] In\r\ntesting this process de Roode found that when sufficient calcium\r\nchlorid was added to combine with all the phosphoric acid present and\r\nthen ammonia added in excess and a portion of the solution filtered,\r\nno test for phosphoric acid could be obtained; but, that if in\r\naddition to the calcium chlorid and ammonia, some ammonium oxalate or\r\ncarbonate was added, a filtered portion of the solution gave a test\r\nfor phosphoric acid.[211] This is accounted for by the fact that the\r\ncalcium phosphate, which is precipitated by the ammonia, is changed by\r\nthe ammonium oxalate or carbonate into calcium oxalate or carbonate\r\nand ammonium phosphate, so that the very object for which the calcium\r\nchlorid was added is defeated by the addition of the ammonium oxalate\r\nor carbonate. In order to make the use of calcium chlorid effective\r\nit is necessary to filter the liquid from the precipitate formed by\r\nthe calcium chlorid and ammonia and then add the ammonium oxalate or\r\ncarbonate to the filtrate. This necessitates two separate filtrations\r\nand makes the proposed method of Huston as long as the old process.\r\n\r\n=263. Rapid Control Method for Potash Salts.=—For rapid control work\r\nwhere great accuracy is not required Albert recommends that the finely\r\nground substance be placed in a liter flask and about 400 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water added and three cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid.[212] After boiling, barium chlorid is added drop by drop as long\r\nas a precipitate is produced. After cooling, the flask is filled to\r\nthe mark and shaken and its contents filtered through a dry filter. An\r\naliquot portion of the filtrate is evaporated with platinum chlorid\r\nsolution in a smooth porcelain dish almost to dryness and the mass\r\ntreated with alcohol, filtered through a weighed filter, and well\r\nwashed with alcohol. The filter is then dried in an air-bath to a\r\nconstant weight. For the different kinds of potash materials on the\r\nmarket the following proportions are recommended:\r\n\r\n_Kainit or Carnallit._—Twenty grams in one liter: Fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate are evaporated with forty of platinic\r\nchlorid solution. The weight of potassium platinochlorid obtained ×\r\n19.3 gives the per cent of K₂O.\r\n\r\n_Sulfate of Potash._—Fifteen grams in one liter: Twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution are evaporated with fifteen of platinic\r\nchlorid. The weight of potassium platinochlorid obtained × 64.33 gives\r\nthe per cent of K₂O.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Chlorid._—Ten grams in one liter: Twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters are evaporated with fifteen of platinic chlorid solution.\r\nThe weight of the precipitate obtained × 77.2 gives the per cent of K₂O.\r\n\r\n=264. Weighing the Precipitate as Metallic Platinum.=—Hilgard calls\r\nattention to the difficulty of weighing the double chlorid of platinum\r\nand potash as such, although he acknowledges that in the gooch this\r\nweighing can be made with great accuracy.[213] He prefers to estimate\r\nthe platinum in the metallic state and uses for this purpose a platinum\r\ncrucible the inside of which, half way up from the bottom, is coated\r\nwith a layer of platinum sponge, which is conveniently prepared by\r\nthe decomposition of a few decigrams of the platinum double salt by\r\ninclining the crucible and rotating it during the progress of the\r\nreduction, using about a quarter of an hour in all. The platinum sponge\r\nproduced in this way greatly favors the decomposition of the double\r\nsalt for analytical purposes. The decomposition of the salt takes place\r\nquickly and quietly and at conveniently low temperatures.\r\n\r\nWhen the decomposition is ended the crucible is strongly heated so as\r\nto hold the platinum sponge, which is produced, together sufficiently\r\nto prevent its being removed in the subsequent washing of the crucible\r\nby decantation. By the ignition at a high temperature necessary to\r\nsecure this, the greater part of the calcium chlorid is volatilized.\r\nAfter cooling, a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid are placed\r\nin the crucible and if the slightest yellow color be shown the acid is\r\nevaporated and the ignition repeated, with the addition of a little\r\noxalic acid. In most cases the slight yellow color produced comes\r\nfrom a trace of iron and will therefore appear again after the second\r\nignition. The crucible is subsequently washed by repeated decantations,\r\nfinally with boiling water, and after drying is ignited and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this process is that without further trouble the\r\nreduced metal is completely freed of any salts of the alkaline earths,\r\netc., which have been carried down with it and also from any of the\r\nuncombined sodium chlorid which may not have been washed out by the\r\nalcohol. In fact, the results obtained in this way are nearly always\r\nlower than those obtained through the direct weighing of the double\r\nsalt, and the wash water which is first poured off contains, as a rule,\r\ntraces of the alkaline earths and almost without exception some sodium\r\nchlorid. Correction for the filter ash is unnecessary because the ash\r\nis completely dissolved by the treatment received. The platinum sponge\r\nwhich is collected in the crucible in this way is removed in case it\r\ndoes not adhere to the sides and the crucible is then ready for the\r\nnext operation.\r\n\r\n=265. Sources of Error in the Platinum Method.=—In the comparative work\r\ndone in the determination of potash by the members of the Association\r\nof Official Agricultural Chemists there has been noted, from year to\r\nyear, marked differences in the data obtained by different analysts.\r\nSuch differences often are due to personal errors, or a failure to\r\naccurately follow the directions for manipulation. Sometimes, however,\r\nthey are due to sources of error in the processes employed. In the\r\nplatinum method these sources of error have been long known to exist.\r\nChief among these is the remarkable facility with which potash becomes\r\nincorporated with the precipitates of other bodies. The character\r\nand magnitude of some of these errors have lately been studied by\r\nRobinson.[214]\r\n\r\nMany precipitates occlude potash and hold it so firmly that it cannot\r\nbe washed out with hot water although the potash compounds present\r\nin the precipitate are perfectly soluble. It appears to be a kind of\r\nmolecular adhesion. Barium sulfate has this property of attaching\r\npotash molecules in a high degree, and ferric and aluminic compounds\r\nonly to a slightly less extent. To reduce the losses, consequent on the\r\nconditions just mentioned, to a minimum, the sulfuric acid and earthy\r\nbases should be very slowly precipitated, with violent agitation, at a\r\nboiling temperature.\r\n\r\nAnother source of loss in the platinum method arises from the\r\nuse of a solution of ammonium chlorid for washing the potassium\r\nplatinochlorid precipitate. There is danger here, not only of the\r\nsolution of the impurities present in the precipitate, but also\r\nof a double decomposition by means of which some ammonium may be\r\nsubstituted for the potassium in the washed product. In the official\r\nmethod, moreover, there is danger of securing a final precipitate\r\nwhich may contain traces of calcium and magnesium sulfates when these\r\nbodies are abundantly present in the sample taken for analysis. The\r\ncareful analyst must guard against these sources of error, but it is\r\nprobably true that he will never secure a practically chemically pure\r\nprecipitate of potassium platinochlorid when working on the mixed\r\nfertilizers found in commerce.\r\n\r\n=266. Effect of Concentration on the Accuracy of Potash\r\nAnalysis.=—Winton has also studied the sources of error in the\r\ndetermination of potash as platinochlorid, especially with reference\r\nto the effect of the concentration of the solution at the time of\r\nprecipitation.[215]\r\n\r\nHe finds that the method of precipitating in concentrated solutions and\r\ndrying the potassium platinochlorid at 130°, depends for its accuracy\r\nupon the mutual compensation of three errors; _viz._, (1) to the\r\nsolubility of the potassium salt in eighty per cent alcohol, (2) to the\r\npresence of water in the crystals which is not driven off at 130°, and\r\n(3) the use of a factor based on the wrong atomic weight of platinum.\r\n\r\nHe finds, further, that the error due to the presence of water occluded\r\nin the crystals can be reduced to a minimum, and the process of drying\r\ngreatly simplified, by adding the solution of platinum chlorid to the\r\npotash solution in a dilute condition, not exceeding one per cent\r\nin strength. The potassium platinochlorid thus produced can be very\r\neffectively dried at 100°. The error due to the solubility of the\r\nsalt in eighty per cent alcohol can also be greatly reduced by using\r\nninety-five per cent alcohol. The error due to the wrong factor, based\r\non the old atomic weight of platinum, _viz._, 0.3056, can be corrected\r\nby using the factor based on the recently determined atomic weight of\r\nplatinum, _viz._, 195, which is 0.30688.\r\n\r\n=267. Differences in Crystalline Form.=—Winton has also observed a\r\ndistinct difference in the crystals of potassium platinochlorid when\r\nobtained from concentrated and dilute solutions.[216] When platinic\r\nchlorid is added to a concentrated solution of potassium chlorid, a\r\nlarge part of the salt which is formed is precipitated in a pulverulent\r\nstate, the remainder being deposited on evaporation. After treating\r\nwith alcohol, filtering, and drying, the double salt is found in the\r\nstate of a fine powder which, when examined under the microscope, is\r\nfound to consist largely of radiating crystals. The characteristic form\r\nis one having six arms formed by the intersection, at right angles, of\r\nthree bars. Numerous globular cavities in the crystals are observed in\r\nwhich mother liquid is enclosed. For this reason the salt is not easily\r\ndried at 100°, but when so dried loses additional moisture at 130°,\r\nand still more at 160°. The total additional loss, after drying at\r\n100°, from this cause may amount to as much as six-tenths per cent of\r\npotassium chlorid.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the solution of the potassium salt is so dilute that\r\nno precipitate at all is formed on the addition of platinic chlorid,\r\nthe double salt is all deposited, as well as formed slowly, during\r\nthe evaporation and occurs exclusively as octahedra. These octahedra\r\nare comparatively free of cavities, and give up practically all their\r\nmoisture when dried at 100°. A method of procedure therefore for\r\npotash determination, based on the above principle of the addition of\r\nthe reagent to dilute solutions, and drying the double salt produced\r\nupon evaporation, after washing with ninety-five per cent alcohol at\r\n100°, and using the factor 0.30688 for potassium chlorid and 0.1939\r\nfor potassium oxid, gives good results and is regarded as better than\r\nany of the methods which prescribe the addition of platinic chlorid to\r\nhighly concentrated potash solutions.\r\n\r\n=268. Factors for Potash Estimation.=—The factor now in use by the\r\nofficial chemists to convert potassium platinochlorid into potash (K₂O)\r\nis 0.19308, and for potassium chlorid 0.3056.\r\n\r\nWolfbauer gives the differences which may arise by computing the potash\r\nfrom its platino-double chlorid by the different values assigned to the\r\natomic weight of platinum.[217]\r\n\r\nThe common factor used to obtain potassium chlorid from potassium\r\nplatinochlorid is based on the atomic weight 197.18 and is derived from\r\nthe formula:\r\n\r\n               2(39.13 + 35.46)      149.18\r\n    ------------------------------ = ------ = 0.30557.\r\n    2 × 39.13 + 197.18 + 6 × 35.46 = 488.20\r\n\r\nThe variations arising from taking other assigned values for the atomic\r\nweight of platinum are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                             Factor for potassium   Relation to factor\r\n                                 chlorid from              0.30557\r\n                                                         in per cent\r\n     Atomic    Determined\r\n    weight of     or         Potassium              Potassium\r\n    Platinum.  calculated    platino-   Platinum.   platino-   Platinum.\r\n                  by         chlorid.               chlorid.\r\n\r\n     197.18    Berzelius     0.30557     0.75658     100.00      100.00\r\n     197.88    Andrews       0.30517     0.75390      99.86       99.65\r\n     195.06    Haberstadt    0.30690     0.76468     100.44      101.07\r\n               Seubert   }\r\n     194.87    and Clark }   0.30700     0.76555     100.47      101.20\r\n\r\nThe factor 0.3056 is regarded as the best for the computation from\r\npotassium platinochlorid and 0.7566 from platinum. It is also suggested\r\nthat it is better to make the computation from the reduced platinum\r\nthan from the double salt.\r\n\r\n=269. Recovery of the Platinum Waste and Preparation of the Platinic\r\nChlorid Solution.=—(1) _By Reduction in Alkaline Alcohol._—All\r\nfiltrates containing platinic chlorid, all precipitates of potassium\r\nplatinochlorid and all residues of metallic platinum should be\r\ncarefully preserved and the platinum recovered therefrom by the\r\nfollowing process: The platinum residues are placed in a large\r\nporcelain dish. Since these residues contain a large amount of alcohol\r\nthey should be diluted with about one-third their volume of water, and\r\nwhen boiling treated with some sodium carbonate. The solid potassium\r\nplatinochlorids should not be added until the liquid is boiling, and\r\nthen only little by little. The heating on the water-bath is continued\r\nuntil the liquid floating over the platinum sponge is quite clear and\r\nonly slightly yellow. The liquid is then poured off and the reduced\r\nplatinum purified by boiling with hydrochloric acid and water. It is\r\nthen dried and ignited to destroy any organic matter which may be\r\npresent. It is advisable to boil the finely divided platinum once with\r\nstrong nitric acid, and after this is poured off the solution of the\r\nplatinum is effected in a large porcelain dish over a water-bath by\r\nadding about four times its weight of hydrochloric acid, warming, and\r\nadding nitric acid, little by little. After the platinum is in solution\r\nthe evaporation is continued until a drop of the liquid, removed by a\r\nglass rod, quickly solidifies. The crystalline mass which is formed\r\non cooling is taken up with water and filtered, and then a sufficient\r\namount of water added so that each ten cubic centimeters will contain\r\none gram of platinum. The specific gravity of this solution is 1.18 at\r\nordinary temperatures. Special care must be taken that the solution\r\ncontains neither platinous chlorid nor nitrogen compounds. If the first\r\nnamed compound be present it should be converted into platinic chlorid\r\nby treatment with fuming hydrochloric acid and a little nitric acid.\r\nThe last mentioned compound may be removed by evaporating successively\r\nwith hydrochloric acid and water. If the platinic chlorid be made\r\nfrom waste platinum, the danger of contamination with iridium must be\r\nconsidered. In such a case the platinum should be separated as ammonium\r\nplatinochlorid, which can afterwards be reduced as above indicated.\r\nA convenient test of the purity of platinic chlorid solution is\r\naccomplished by the precipitation of a known weight of chemically pure\r\npotassium salt.\r\n\r\n(2) _By Reduction in Nascent Hydrogen._—The platinum residues,\r\nfiltrates containing platinum, etc., are collected in a large flask and\r\nevaporated in a large dish on a water-bath, and reduced by means of\r\nzinc and hydrochloric acid to metallic platinum, the mass being warmed\r\nuntil all the zinc has been dissolved. The supernatant liquid standing\r\nover the spongy platinum is decanted and the spongy mass boiled twice\r\nwith distilled water. The spongy platinum is then brought on a filter\r\nand washed till the filtrate shows no acid reaction. The filter and\r\nplatinum sponge are next incinerated in a platinum dish and the residue\r\nweighed. The weighed mass of pure platinum is dissolved in hydrochloric\r\nacid, with the addition of as little nitric acid as possible, and,\r\nafter cooling, filtered. The filtrate is afterwards evaporated in a\r\nporcelain dish on a water-bath to a sirupy consistence, taken up with\r\nwater and filtered. To this filtrate enough water is now added to make\r\nthe solution correspond to one gram of metallic platinum in ten cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESTIMATION OF POTASH AS PERCHLORATE.\r\n\r\n=270. General Principles.=—By reason of the great cost of platinum\r\nchlorid analysts have sought for a reagent of a cheaper nature and yet\r\ncapable of forming an insoluble compound with potash. Phosphomolybdic\r\nand perchloric acids are the reagents which have given the most\r\npromising results.[218] The principle of the method with the latter\r\nsalt is based on the insolubility of potassium perchlorate in strong\r\nalcohol containing a little perchloric acid and the comparative easy\r\nsolubility of the other bases usually associated with potassium in\r\nwater. The French chemists have stated that magnesia, when present in\r\nconsiderable quantities, interferes with the accuracy of the results.\r\nSince in soil analysis considerable quantities of magnesia are often\r\nfound, this base, according to the French chemists, should previously\r\nbe removed when present in any considerable quantity, by the process\r\ndescribed in the first volume. Kreider, however, as will be seen\r\nfurther on, working in the presence of magnesia, did not notice any\r\ndisturbing effects caused thereby. The method is applicable to the\r\ncommon potash salts of the trade and with certain precautions to\r\nmixed salts. As will be mentioned later on, sulfuric acid should be\r\npreviously removed and this is likely to introduce an error on account\r\nof the tendency of barium sulfate to entangle particles of potash\r\namong its molecules and thus remove them from solution. The barium\r\nsulfate should be precipitated slowly and in a strongly acid (nitric or\r\nhydrochloric) solution. The loss, which is inevitable, is thus reduced\r\nto a minimum and does not seriously affect the value of the numbers\r\nfound. It is important to have an abundant supply of pure perchloric\r\nacid, and as this is not readily obtainable in the market the best\r\nmethods of preparing it are given below. The method, while it has not\r\nbeen worked out extensively, is one of merit, and seemingly is worthy\r\nof fair trial by analysts. The process is by no means a new one, but\r\nit will not be necessary to describe here its development any further\r\nthan to refer to the methods proposed by Serullas,[219] Schlösing,[220]\r\nKraut,[221] and Bertrand,[222] The method was fully developed by a\r\ncommittee appointed by the French agricultural chemists in 1887.[223]\r\n\r\nWense has also described an improved method of estimating potash as\r\nperchlorate after the removal of sulfuric acid and also a process of\r\npreparing perchloric acid by distilling potassium perchlorate with\r\nsulfuric acid in a vacuum.[224] He was also the first who proposed\r\nthe plan of rendering potassium perchlorate insoluble in alcohol by\r\ndissolving a little perchloric acid therein.[225] The best approved\r\nmethods now known of preparing the perchloric acid and conducting the\r\nanalysis will be described in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=271. Caspari’s Method for Preparing Perchloric Acid.=—A hessian\r\ncrucible about fifteen centimeters high is filled with moderately well\r\ncompressed pure potassium chlorate and gradually heated in a suitable\r\nfurnace until the contents become fluid.[226] The heat must then be\r\ncarefully regulated to avoid loss by foaming due to the evolution of\r\noxygen. The heat is continued until oxygen is no longer given off and\r\nthe surface of the liquid becomes encrusted, which will take place in\r\nfrom one and a half to two hours.\r\n\r\nAfter cooling, the contents of the crucible are pulverized and heated,\r\nwith vigorous stirring, to boiling, with one and a half times their\r\nweight of water. By this process the potassium chlorid which has\r\nformed during the first reaction is dissolved and is thus removed. The\r\nresidual salt is washed with additional quantities of cold water and\r\nfinally dried. To remove the potassium salt from the crude potassium\r\nperchlorate obtained as above, recourse is had to hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid. The reaction is represented by the following formula: 2KClO₄ +\r\nH₂SiF₆ = K₂SiF₆ + HClO₄. In order to effect this decomposition the\r\npotassium perchlorate is dissolved in seven times its weight of hot\r\nwater and an excess of hydrofluosilicic added to the boiling solution.\r\nThe boiling is continued for about an hour until particles of potassium\r\nperchlorate can no longer be detected with addition of water to\r\ncompensate for evaporation.\r\n\r\nOn cooling the gelatinous potassium silicofluorid is deposited and\r\nthe perchloric acid separated therefrom as completely as possible\r\nby decantation. The residue is again boiled with water and a little\r\nhydrofluosilicic acid and the clear liquor thus obtained added to\r\nthe first lot. Finally, any residual perchloric acid may be removed\r\non an asbestos felt under pressure. The clear liquid thus obtained\r\nis evaporated on a steam-bath to the greatest possible degree of\r\nconcentration and allowed to stand in a cool place for twenty-four\r\nhours, whereby is effected the separation of any remaining potassium\r\nsilicofluorid or potassium perchlorate. The residual liquid when\r\nfiltered through an asbestos felt should give a perfectly clear\r\nfiltrate. In order to throw out the last traces of hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid and any sulfuric acid present an equal volume of water is added,\r\nand while cold small quantities of barium chlorid are successively\r\nadded until the barium salt is present in a very slight excess. The\r\nclear supernatant liquid is poured off after a few hours and evaporated\r\nuntil the hydrochloric acid is all expelled and white fumes of\r\nperchloric acid are noticed. Any potassium perchlorate still remaining\r\nwill now be separated and, in the cold, sodium perchlorate will also\r\nbe separated in crystals. The clear residue is again diluted with an\r\nequal volume of water and any barium salts present carefully removed\r\nwith sulfuric acid. The mass is allowed to stand for one or two days,\r\nand is then filtered through paper and is ready for use. The purity of\r\nthe acid obtained depends chiefly on the purity of the hydrofluosilicic\r\nacid at first used. Hence to get good results this acid must be free\r\nfrom foreign bodies. If an absolutely pure product be desired the acid\r\nabove obtained must be distilled in a vacuum.\r\n\r\n=272. Method of Kreider.=—Kreider has worked out a simpler method of\r\npreparing perchloric acid which will make it easy for every analyst to\r\nmake and keep a supply of this admirable yet unappreciated reagent.\r\nThis method is conducted as follows:[227]\r\n\r\nA convenient quantity of sodium chlorate, from 100 to 300 grains,\r\nis melted in a glass retort or round-bottomed flask and gradually\r\nraised to a temperature at which oxygen is freely, but not too rapidly\r\nevolved, and kept at this temperature till the fused mass thickens\r\nthroughout, indicating the complete conversion of the chlorate to the\r\nchlorid and perchlorate, which requires from one and one-half to two\r\nhours: or the retort may be connected with a gasometer and the end of\r\nthe reaction determined by the volume of oxygen expelled, according to\r\nthe equation\r\n\r\n    2NAClO₃ = NACl + NAClO₄ + O₂.\r\n\r\nThe product thus obtained is washed from the retort to a capacious\r\nevaporating dish where it is treated with sufficient hydrochloric acid\r\nto effect the complete reduction of the residual chlorate, which, if\r\nthe ignition has been carefully conducted with well distributed heat,\r\nwill be present in but small amount. It is then evaporated to dryness\r\non the steam-bath, or more quickly over a direct flame, and with but\r\nlittle attention until a point near to dryness has been reached,\r\nwhen stirring will be found of great advantage in facilitating the\r\nvolatilization of the remaining liquid and in breaking up the mass\r\nof salt. Otherwise the perchlorate seems to solidify with a certain\r\namount of water and its removal from the dish, without moistening and\r\nreheating, is impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter triturating the residue, easily accomplished in a porcelain\r\nmortar, an excess of the strongest hydrochloric acid is added to the\r\ndry salt, preferably in a tall beaker where there is less surface for\r\nthe escape of hydrochloric acid and from which the acid can be decanted\r\nwithout disturbing the precipitated chlorid. If the salt has been\r\nreduced to a very fine powder, by stirring energetically for a minute,\r\nthe hydrochloric acid will set free the perchloric acid and precipitate\r\nthe sodium as chlorid, which in a few minutes settles, leaving a clear\r\nsolution of the perchloric acid with the excess of hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe clear supernatant liquid is then decanted upon a gooch, through\r\nwhich it may be rapidly drawn with the aid of suction, and the residue\r\nretreated with the strongest hydrochloric acid, settled, and again\r\ndecanted, the salt being finally brought upon the filter where it is\r\nwashed with a little strong hydrochloric acid. A large platinum cone\r\nwill be found more convenient than the crucible, because of its greater\r\ncapacity and filtering surface. When the filter will not hold all the\r\nsodium chlorid, the latter, after washing, may be removed by water or\r\nby mechanical means, with precautions not to disturb the felt, which\r\nis then ready for the remainder. Of course, if water is used, the felt\r\nhad better be washed with a little strong hydrochloric acid before\r\nreceiving another portion of the salt. This residue will be found to\r\ncontain only an inconsiderable amount of perchlorate, when tested by\r\nfirst heating to expel the free acid and then treating the dry and\r\npowdered residue with ninety-seven per cent alcohol, which dissolves\r\nthe perchlorate of sodium but has little soluble effect on the chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate, containing the perchloric acid with the excess of\r\nhydrochloric acid and the small per cent of sodium chlorid which is\r\nsoluble in the latter, is then evaporated over the steam-bath till all\r\nhydrochloric acid is expelled and the heavy white fumes of perchloric\r\nacid appear, when it is ready for use in potassium determinations.\r\nEvidently the acid will not be chemically pure because the sodium\r\nchlorid is not absolutely insoluble in hydrochloric acid; but a portion\r\ntested with silver nitrate will prove that the sodium, together with\r\nany other bases which may have gone through the filter, has been\r\ncompletely converted into perchlorate, and unless the original chlorate\r\ncontained some potassium or on evaporation the acid was exposed to\r\nthe fumes of ammonia, the residue of the evaporation of a portion is\r\neasily and completely soluble in ninety-seven per cent alcohol and its\r\npresence is therefore unobjectionable. One cubic centimeter of the acid\r\nthus obtained gives on evaporation a residue of only 0.036 gram, which\r\nis completely soluble in ninety-seven per cent alcohol.\r\n\r\nCaspari’s acid under similar treatment gave a residue in one case\r\nof 0.024 gram and in another 0.047 gram. If, however, a portion of\r\npure acid be required, it may be obtained by distilling this product\r\nunder diminished pressure and, as Caspari has shown, without great\r\nloss providing the heat is regulated according to the fumes in the\r\ndistilling flask.\r\n\r\nSome modification of the above treatment will be found necessary in\r\ncase the sodium chlorate contains any potassium as an impurity, or if\r\nthe latter has been introduced from the vessel in which the fusion was\r\nmade. In these circumstances the hydrochloric acid would not suffice\r\nfor the removal of potassium, since a trace might also go over with\r\nthe sodium and thus on evaporation a residue insoluble in ninety-seven\r\nper cent alcohol be obtained. To avoid this difficulty, the mixture of\r\nsodium perchlorate and chlorid, after treating with hydrochloric acid\r\nfor the reduction of the residual chlorate, being reduced to a fine\r\npowder, is well digested with ninety-seven per cent alcohol, which\r\ndissolves the sodium perchlorate but leaves the chlorid, as well as\r\nany potassium salt insoluble. By giving the alcohol time to become\r\nsaturated, which was facilitated by stirring, it was found on filtering\r\nand evaporating that an average of about two-tenths of a gram of sodium\r\nperchlorate are obtained for every cubic centimeter of alcohol and that\r\nthe product thus obtained is comparatively free of chlorids, until the\r\nperchlorate is nearly all removed, when more of the chlorid seems to\r\ndissolve. This treatment with alcohol is continued until on evaporation\r\nof a small portion of the latest filtrate, only a small residue is\r\nfound. The alcoholic solution of the perchlorate is then distilled from\r\na large flask until the perchlorate begins to crystallize, when the\r\nheat is removed and the contents quickly emptied into an evaporating\r\ndish, the same liquid being used to wash out the remaining portions of\r\nthe salt. When the distillation is terminated at the point indicated,\r\nthe distillate will contain most of the alcohol employed, but in a\r\nsomewhat stronger solution, so that it requires only diluting to\r\nninety-seven per cent to fit it for use in future preparations. The\r\nsalt is then evaporated to dryness on the steam-bath and subsequently\r\ntreated with strong hydrochloric acid for the separation of the\r\nperchloric acid.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of the acid prepared in this way, on evaporation\r\ngave a residue in one case of 0.0369 gram, and in another 0.0307 gram,\r\ncompletely soluble in ninety-seven per cent alcohol, which was then\r\nignited and the chlorin determined by silver from which the equivalent\r\nof perchloric acid in the form of salts was calculated as 0.0305 gram.\r\nBy neutralizing the acid with sodium carbonate, evaporating, igniting\r\nin an atmosphere of carbon dioxid till decomposition was complete,\r\ncollecting the oxygen over caustic potash, allowing it to act on\r\nhydriodic acid by intervention of nitric oxid, according to a process\r\nsoon to be published, titrating the iodin liberated, with standard\r\narsenic and calculating the equivalent of perchloric acid, after\r\nsubtracting the amount of acid found in the form of salts, the amount\r\nof free acid per cubic centimeter proved to be 0.9831 gram.\r\n\r\nThe whole process, even when the separation with alcohol is necessary,\r\ncan not well require more than two days and during the greater part of\r\nthat time the work proceeds without attention.\r\n\r\n=273. Keeping Properties of Perchloric Acid.=—By most authorities it\r\nis asserted that perchloric acid is a very unstable body and is liable\r\nto decompose with explosive violence even when kept in the dark. It\r\nis probable that this tendency to spontaneous decomposition has been\r\nexaggerated. It is not even mentioned in Gmelin’s Handbook.[228]\r\n\r\nThe most concentrated aqueous acid has a specific gravity of 1.65, is\r\ncolorless, fumes slightly when exposed to the air, and boils at 200°.\r\nIt has no odor, possesses an oily consistence and has a strong and\r\nagreeably acid taste. It reddens litmus without bleaching it and is\r\nslowly volatilized at 138° without decomposition. It is unaffected by\r\nexposure to the light, even the sun’s rays. It is not decomposed by\r\nhydrosulfuric, sulfurous, or hydrochloric acids, nor by alcohol. Paper\r\nsaturated with the strong acid does not take fire spontaneously, but it\r\ndeflagrates with red-hot charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe acid prepared by the method of Kreider has approximately the\r\ncomposition of the di-hydrate, HClO₄·2H₂O.[229] Unless well evaporated,\r\nhowever, it is a little more dilute than is shown by the above formula.\r\nThe di-hydrate is quite stable and the more dilute acid can be kept\r\nfor an indefinite time. Kreider has kept the acid for six months and\r\nnoticed no change whatever in its composition. Acid containing one gram\r\nof perchloric acid in a cubic centimeter has been kept three months\r\nwith perfect safety. There is no reason why the strong aqueous acid\r\nshould not be made a regular article of commerce by dealers in chemical\r\nsupplies, under proper restrictions for storage and transportation.\r\n\r\nThe strong acid made in this laboratory by the Kreider method has not\r\ngiven the least indication of easy or spontaneous decomposition.\r\n\r\n=274. The Analytical Process.=—The perchlorate process cannot be\r\napplied in the presence of sulfuric acid or dissolved sulfates. This\r\nacid, when present, is to be removed by the usual methods before\r\napplying the perchloric acid. Phosphoric acid may be present, but\r\nin this case a considerable excess of the reagent must be used. The\r\nprocess, as originally proposed by Caspari and carried out by Kreider,\r\nis as follows:[230]\r\n\r\nThe substance, free from sulfuric acid, is evaporated for the expulsion\r\nof free hydrochloric acid, the residue stirred with twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot water and then treated with perchloric acid, in\r\nquantity not less than one and one-half times that required by the\r\nbases present, when it is evaporated, with frequent stirring, to\r\na thick, sirup-like consistency, again dissolved in hot water and\r\nevaporated, with continued stirring, till all hydrochloric acid has\r\nbeen expelled and the fumes of perchloric acid appear. Further loss of\r\nperchloric acid is to be compensated for by addition of more. The cold\r\nmass is then well stirred with about twenty cubic centimeters of wash\r\nalcohol—ninety-seven per cent alcohol containing two-tenths per cent by\r\nweight of pure perchloric acid, with precautions against reducing the\r\npotassium perchlorate crystals to too fine a powder. After settling,\r\nthe alcohol is decanted on the asbestos filter and the residue\r\nsimilarly treated with about the same amount of wash alcohol, settled,\r\nand again decanted. The residual salt is then deprived of alcohol by\r\ngently heating, dissolved in ten cubic centimeters of hot water and a\r\nlittle perchloric acid, when it is evaporated once more, with stirring,\r\nuntil fumes of perchloric acid rise. It is then washed with one cubic\r\ncentimeter of wash alcohol, transferred to the asbestos, preferably\r\nby a policeman to avoid excessive use of alcohol, and covered finally\r\nwith pure alcohol; the whole wash process requiring from about fifty to\r\nseventy cubic centimeters of alcohol. It is then dried at about 130°\r\nand weighed.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of a gooch for the truncated pipette employed by\r\nCaspari will be found advantageous; and asbestos capable of forming a\r\nclose, compact felt should be selected, inasmuch as the perchlorate\r\nis in part unavoidably reduced, during the necessary stirring, to so\r\nfine a condition that it tends to run through the filter when under\r\npressure. A special felt of an excellent quality of asbestos was\r\nprepared for the determinations given below and seemed to hold the\r\nfiner particles of the perchlorate very satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nA number of determinations made of potassium, unmixed with other bases\r\nor non-volatile acids, is recorded in the following table:\r\n\r\n    Potassium                Potassium   Error on     Error on\r\n     chlorid    Volume of   perchlorate  potassium   potassium  Error on\r\n      taken.    filtrate.     found.    perchlorate.  chlorid.   potash.\r\n\r\n                  Cubic\r\n     Grams.     centimeters.

As Caspari has pointed out, the sulfuric acid must be\r\nremoved by precipitation as barium sulfate before the treatment with\r\nperchloric acid is attempted, and unless the precipitation is made in a\r\nstrongly acid solution, some potassium is carried down with the barium.\r\nPhosphoric acid need not be previously removed, but to secure a nearly\r\ncomplete separation of this acid from the potassium, a considerable\r\nexcess of perchloric acid should be left upon the potassium perchlorate\r\nbefore it is treated with the alcohol. When these conditions are\r\ncarefully complied with, fairly good results may justly be expected.\r\nBelow is given a number of the results obtained:\r\n\r\n    (A) = Volume of filtrate. Cubic centimeters.\r\n    (B) = Potassium perchlorate found.\r\n    (C) = Error on potassium perchlorate.\r\n    (D) = Error on potassium chlorid.\r\n    (E) = Error on potassium potash.\r\n\r\n       Compounds taken.

If, therefore, a sufficient\r\nexcess of acid be used, no interference will be caused by the presence\r\nof magnesium.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true, therefore, that the potassium perchlorate obtained\r\nmay be contaminated with a trace of phosphoric acid, if the latter be\r\npresent in large quantity, no fear of contamination with magnesia need\r\nbe entertained if a sufficient quantity of the perchloric acid be used.\r\n\r\n=275. Removal of the Sulfuric Acid.=—The practical objection to the\r\nremoval of the sulfuric acid in the form of barium sulfate rests on the\r\nfact of the mechanical entanglement of some of the potash in the barium\r\nsalt. Unless special precautions are taken, therefore, a considerable\r\namount of the potash will be found with the barium sulfate.\r\n\r\nCaspari has succeeded in reducing this amount to a minimum by the\r\nfollowing procedure:[237] The solution of barium chlorid is prepared by\r\ndissolving 127 grams of crystallized barium chlorid in water, adding\r\n125 cubic centimeters of thirty-five per cent hydrochloric acid, and\r\nbringing the total volume up to one liter with water.\r\n\r\nFive grams of the substance from which the sulfuric acid is to be\r\nremoved are boiled with 150 cubic centimeters of water and twenty of\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid. While the solution is still in ebullition\r\nit is treated, drop by drop with constant stirring, with the barium\r\nchlorid solution above mentioned, until a slight excess is added.\r\nThis excess does not cause any inconvenience subsequently. After the\r\nprecipitation is complete the boiling is continued for a few minutes,\r\nthe mixture cooled and made up to a quarter of a liter with water. No\r\naccount is taken of the volume of the barium sulfate formed since,\r\neven with the precautions mentioned, a little potassium is thrown down\r\nand the volume of the barium sulfate tends to correct this error. With\r\na solution from which the sulfuric acid had been removed as above\r\nindicated, Caspari found a loss of only one milligram of potassium\r\nperchlorate in a precipitate weighing over 800 milligrams.\r\n\r\n=276. Applicability of the Process.=—Experience has shown that sulfuric\r\nacid is the only substance which need be removed from ordinary\r\nfertilizers preparatory to the estimation of the potash by means of\r\nperchloric acid. The fact that this process can be used in the presence\r\nof phosphoric acid is a matter of great importance in the estimation\r\nof potash in fertilizers, inasmuch as these fertilizers nearly always\r\ncontain that acid. The fact that the French chemists noticed that\r\nmagnesia was a disturbing element in the process, as has been indicated\r\nin volume first, probably arose from its presence as sulfate. Neither\r\nCaspari nor Kreider has noticed any disturbance in the results which\r\ncan be traced to the presence of magnesia as a base.\r\n\r\nIf ammonia be present, however, there is a tendency to the production\r\nof ammonium perchlorate which is somewhat insoluble in the alcohol wash\r\nused. Solutions therefore containing ammonia before treating by the\r\nperchlorate method for potash should be rendered alkaline by soda-lye\r\nand boiled. With the precautions above mentioned, the method promises\r\nto prove of great value in agricultural analysis, effecting both a\r\nsaving of time and expense in potash determinations.\r\n\r\n=277. Accuracy of the Process.=—The perchlorate was tried in\r\nconjunction with the platinum method on the two samples of potash\r\nfertilizer prepared and distributed by the official reporter on potash\r\nfor 1893.[238] One of the samples was of a fertilizer which had been\r\ncompounded for the Florida trade and contained bone, dried blood, and\r\npotash, mostly in the form of sulfate. The other sample consisted\r\nof mixed potash salts, sulfate, chlorid, double salt, kainit, and\r\nabout five per cent of the triple sulfate of calcium, potassium, and\r\nmagnesium.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by Wagner and Caspari on the two samples follow:\r\n\r\n                                 Sample No. 1.     Sample No. 2.\r\n                                Per cent potash.  Per cent potash.\r\n    By the platinum method           13.25             37.98\r\n    By the perchlorate method        13.09             37.82\r\n\r\nThe perchlorate method on the whole appears to be quite as accurate as\r\nthe platinum process, requires less manipulation and can be completed\r\nin a shorter time and at less expense for reagents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART THIRD.\r\n\r\n[185] Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 97, p.\r\n7.\r\n\r\n[186] Annual Report Connecticut Station, 1892, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[187] Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 10.\r\n\r\n[188] Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 103, p.\r\n9.\r\n\r\n[189] Annual Report, Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\n1888, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[190] Vid. op. cit. 2, 1890, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[191] Traité de la Fabrication de Sucre, Horsin-Déon, p. 511.\r\n\r\n[192] Chemical Division, U.

Classification.=—Nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash are\r\nthe most important of the plant foods both from a commercial and\r\nphysiological point of view. They are the chief constituents of the\r\nmost important fertilizers and manures, but are by no means the sole\r\nessential elements of plant nutrition. Lime, magnesia, soda, sulfur,\r\nchlorin, and many other elements are found constantly in plants and\r\nmust be regarded as normal constituents thereof. It is the purpose\r\nhere, however, to speak only of those substances which are used as\r\nfertilizers and which constantly or occasionally are subjected to\r\nchemical examination for determining their commercial or agronomic\r\nvalue. These bodies may be conveniently divided into two classes;\r\n_viz._, mineral and organic. Among those of mineral nature may be\r\nmentioned lime, gypsum, marls, wood-ashes, common salt, and ferrous\r\nsulfate; among those of organic nature may be included guano, hen\r\nmanure, stall manure, composts, and muck.\r\n\r\n=279. Forms of Lime.=—By the term lime is meant the product obtained\r\nby subjecting limestone or other lime carbonates to the action of heat\r\nuntil the carbon dioxid contained therein is expelled. The resulting\r\nlime, CaO, when exposed for some time to the air, or at once on the\r\naddition of water, is converted into the hydrate CaO₂H₂, known as\r\nslaked lime. On longer exposure to the air, the hydrate gradually\r\nabsorbs carbon dioxid and becomes converted into carbonate. In whatever\r\nform, therefore, lime is applied to the soil, it is found in the end,\r\nas carbonate. A distinction should also be made between lime obtained\r\nfrom mineral substances and that got from organic products such as\r\nshells. Strictly speaking this is not a definite matter, inasmuch as\r\nlimestones are sometimes but little more than aggregations of fossil\r\nshells. Practically, however, the distinction is made, and some farmers\r\nprefer shell lime to that of any other kind. Gas lime, that is lime\r\nwhich has been used for the purification of illuminating gas made from\r\ncoal, is hardly to be considered in this connection, since it may\r\ncontain very little even of the hydrate. In this case the lime has been\r\nconverted largely into carbonate and sulfid.\r\n\r\n=280. Application of Lime.=—For many reasons it is important that\r\nthe lime be transported to the field before it has had time to be\r\nconverted into hydrate. The transportation costs less in this state\r\nand it can be handled with far less inconvenience than when slaked.\r\nThe lime should be placed in small piles and left thus, best covered\r\nwith a little earth, until thoroughly slaked. It is then spread evenly\r\nover the surface. The quantity used per acre depends largely on the\r\nnature of the soil. Stiff clays and sour marsh lands require a larger\r\ndressing than loams or well aerated soils. From three to six thousand\r\npounds per acre are the quantities usually employed. When the lime\r\nis once thoroughly incorporated in the soil it is rapidly converted\r\ninto carbonate, but while in the caustic state it may act vigorously\r\nin promoting the decay of organic matter and may prove injurious in\r\npromoting the decomposition of ammonium salts with attendant loss of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n=281. Action of Lime.=—The benefits arising from the application of\r\nlime to agricultural lands, although in many cases great, do not\r\narise from any distinct fertilizing action of its own. Plants need\r\nlime for growth and need plenty of it, but as a rule any soil which\r\nis good enough to grow crops will contain enough lime to furnish that\r\nconstituent of the crops for many years. Its action is both mechanical\r\nand chemical. By virtue of the latter property it renders available\r\nfor plant food bodies already existing in the soil but existing in\r\nsuch shape as to be unavailable for plants. The supply of plant food\r\navailable for the crops of one year is increased but this increase is\r\nat the expense of the following years. Lime is a stimulant. There is an\r\nEuropean proverb that “lime enriches the father but beggars the son.”\r\nNevertheless, a limestone country is usually a fertile one and soils\r\ncontaining plenty of lime naturally, are nearly always rich soils. It\r\nis said that the trees and plants which farmers pick out as indicative\r\nof rich land are nearly always those which prefer lime soils.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical action of lime on soils tends to lighten heavy clays\r\nand loams and to render firmer and more consistent the light and\r\nshifting sandy soils. When a lump of clay is stirred up in a bucket\r\nof rain water the water becomes muddy and remains that way for many\r\ndays. If, however, to the bucket of muddy water a little lime water\r\nbe added the suspended particles of clay begin to flocculate and soon\r\nthe water is clear and the clay falls to the bottom, nor does it again\r\nmake the water muddy for a long time when stirred up with it. The\r\nflocky character of the precipitate is tenaciously retained and it is\r\nnecessary to knead the clay for some time to induce it to reassume its\r\noriginal heavy character. An action like this takes place when lime is\r\nadded to heavy soils so that the soil becomes more porous and assumes\r\na better tilth on plowing. With sandy soils an altogether different\r\naction takes place. In making mortar, as is well known, sand is stirred\r\nin with milk of lime and after being exposed to air for a while the\r\nmixture becomes hard and firm, the firmness increasing with age. This\r\nis due to the fact that when the mortar dries the lime begins to absorb\r\ncarbon dioxid from the air and is converted into grains of carbonate\r\nwhich adhere strongly to neighboring sand grains and to each other\r\nso that the whole soon gets to be a solid mass. Something like this\r\ntakes place in the soil and the sand grains are to some extent bound\r\ntogether. The increased firmness of the soil thus gained is often of\r\nconsiderable advantage.\r\n\r\nBesides these actions, which are more or less mechanical, lime exerts\r\na chemical action on many soil constituents. Feldspar and other\r\ncommon rocks contain potash, and this potash is in such a form as to\r\nbe inaccessible to plants. These rocks exist in the shape of small\r\nparticles in many soils and on them lime exerts a decomposing action,\r\nsetting the potash free. Lime also hastens the decomposition of the\r\nnitrogenous organic matter and at the same time renders the soil more\r\nretentive of the products formed. The conversion of ammonia, resulting\r\nfrom the decomposition of such organic matter into nitrites and\r\nnitrates, is not easily accomplished without a proper amount of calcium\r\ncarbonate. The microorganisms producing this change, which is known\r\nas nitrification, apparently require its presence for neutralizing\r\nthe acid formed. In general, it may be said that the presence of lime\r\nhastens the putrefactive process. This is the reason it is so largely\r\nused in making composts.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say just what soils will be improved by liming and\r\nwhat will not, and it is a matter which must be settled by experiment\r\nin each case. As a rule heavy clays and loams are benefited, yet of two\r\nsuch soils, apparently identical, one may not be affected in any marked\r\ndegree while the other may readily respond to treatment. Sandy soils\r\nare often improved but sometimes not. Sour, boggy lands, are usually\r\nimproved by the addition of enough lime to neutralize their undue\r\nacidity. Marsh grasses and plants are more tolerant of acid in the soil\r\nthan tame grasses are, so that in unlimed soil the former run out the\r\nlatter. The application of lime alone to a very poor soil does not pay.\r\n\r\nThe particles of lime resting in the soil are partially dissolved by\r\nthe next rainfall after application, or by the soil moisture, forming\r\nlime water, and the lime is distributed in this form through the soil\r\nto some extent. It all probably soon becomes converted into carbonate\r\nas ground air is usually quite rich in carbon dioxid. Indeed, for\r\nmany soils, it is immaterial whether lime be applied as lime or as\r\ncarbonate, granting, of course, that the latter be ground to a fine\r\npowder. Economy is in favor of the lime, however, not only because it\r\nneeds no grinding, but because it is lighter than the corresponding\r\namount of carbonate, making a saving in transportation. The difference\r\nis quite considerable, fifty-six pounds of lime being equivalent in\r\neffect to 100 pounds of carbonate. For these reasons as well as because\r\nit possesses some valuable properties not shared by the carbonate, it\r\nis possible that for most localities lime is to be preferred to any\r\nform of ground oyster shells, ground limestone, marble dust or the like.\r\n\r\nOne of these valuable properties not possessed by limestone, is said\r\nto be that of acting as a fungicide and insecticide. As a rule, fungi\r\nprefer acid reaction in the substances in which they grow, so that the\r\nstrongly alkaline properties of lime may make a limed soil unsuitable\r\nfor their growth.[239]\r\n\r\n=282. Analysis of Lime.=—Lime, which is prepared for use as a\r\nfertilizer, is rarely submitted to a chemical examination. It is easy\r\nto see, however, that such an examination is of some importance. If\r\nthe real value of a sample be dependent on the content of lime, the\r\nactual quantity present as determined by analysis, must fix the value\r\nfor agricultural purposes. The more important things to be determined\r\nare the quantities of lime, and of slaked lime, of undecomposed calcium\r\ncarbonate, and of insoluble matter. It will be also of interest to\r\ndetermine the respective quantities of lime present as oxid, hydrate,\r\nand carbonate. If any question be raised in the case of slaked lime in\r\nrespect of its origin, it can usually be answered by an examination of\r\nthe unburned or unslaked residues. In perfectly slaked lime containing\r\nno débris, the analyst will be unable to discover whether it has been\r\nmade from limestone, marble or shells. The lime used for agricultural\r\npurposes should be reasonably free of magnesia, and should not be\r\nair-slaked before transportation to the field. In dry air-slaking, a\r\nconsiderable quantity of carbonate may be formed.\r\n\r\n=283. The Process.=—(1) _Insoluble and Soluble Constituents._—A\r\nrepresentative sample of the lime having been secured, it is reduced to\r\na powder and passed through a half millimeter mesh sieve or ground to\r\na fine powder in an agate mortar. Digest two grams of this sample with\r\nan excess of hydrochloric acid, for two hours with frequent stirring;\r\nfilter, wash the residue with hot distilled water until chlorin is\r\nall removed, and dry to constant weight. The lime, magnesia, silica,\r\nand other constituents of the filtrate, are determined by the usual\r\nprocesses of mineral analysis.[240]\r\n\r\n(2) _State of Combination of the Lime._—In a lime containing only\r\nsmall quantities of magnesia the lime carbonate may be determined by\r\nestimating the carbon dioxid by any one of the reliable processes in\r\nuse.[241] In every case sufficient acid must be employed to combine\r\nwith all the bases present. Tartaric or hydrochloric acid may be used.\r\nFrom the volume or weight of the carbon dioxid obtained the quantity of\r\ncalcium carbonate may be calculated. Since magnesium carbonate is more\r\neasily decomposed by heat than the corresponding calcium compound, any\r\nresidual carbonate in a well-burned sample is probably lime. The total\r\npercentage of lime in the sample is to be determined in the usual way\r\nby precipitation as oxalate and weighing as carbonate or oxid. The lime\r\nexisting as oxid can be determined by exposing a weighed sample in an\r\natmosphere of aqueous vapor until all the lime is slaked. After drying\r\nat 100° the increase in weight is determined and the calcium oxid\r\ncalculated from the formula, CaO + H₂O = CaO₂H₂.\r\n\r\nIf now the total lime be represented by _a_; the lime combined as\r\ncarbonate by _b_; and that present as oxid by _c_; the quantity _x_\r\nexisting as hydrate may be calculated from the equation\r\n\r\n    _x_ = _a_ - (_b_ + _c_).\r\n\r\n    Example: Let the total lime be 88 per cent.\r\n             CaO as carbonate,      2  “   “\r\n             CaO as oxid,          78  “   “\r\n\r\nThen the CaO as hydrate = 88 - (2 + 78) = 8 per cent. The total lime as\r\noxid and hydroxid may also be separated from that present as carbonate\r\nby solution in sugar.[242] One gram of calcium oxid is completely\r\nsoluble in 150 cubic centimeters of a ten per cent sucrose solution.\r\nMagnesia, iron and alumina do not interfere with the determinations.\r\n\r\n=284. Gypsum or Land Plaster.=—This substance is highly prized as a top\r\ndressing for grass and for admixture with stall manure for the purpose\r\nof fixing ammonia. Its value in both cases depends upon its percentage\r\nof hydrated calcium sulfate. The quantity of gypsum mined in the\r\nUnited States in 1893 was a little over 250,000 tons. Of this amount\r\nonly about 50,000 tons were used as fertilizer.[243] In the same time\r\nthere were imported into the United States, in round numbers, 170,000\r\ntons. If the same proportionate part of this were used for fertilizing\r\npurposes, it may be said that the annual consumption of land plaster in\r\nthe United States at the present time for agricultural uses is about\r\n75,000 tons.\r\n\r\nGypsum, being a very soft mineral, is easily ground and should be in\r\nthe state of a fine powder when used for fertilizing purposes. It is\r\nsoluble in about 500 parts of rain water, so that when applied as a top\r\ndressing it is carried into the soil by rain. Its favorable action is\r\nboth as a plant food and mechanically in modifying, in an advantageous\r\nway, the physical constituents of the soil. It is also valuable for\r\ncomposting and for use in stables by reason of its power of fixing\r\nammonia by the formation of lime carbonate and ammonium sulfate:\r\n\r\n    (H₄N)₂CO₃ + CaSO₄ = (H₄N)₂SO₄ + CaCO₃.\r\n\r\n=285. Analysis of Gypsum.=—For agricultural purposes it will be\r\nsufficient to determine the quantity of sulfuric acid, and to calculate\r\ntherefrom the amount of calcium sulfate in the sample: Or the lime may\r\nbe determined and the quantity of sulfate calculated therefrom.\r\n\r\n(1) _Insoluble Matter._—In the conduct of the work the sample of\r\ngypsum is rubbed to an impalpable powder in an agate mortar. The\r\nwashed sample, about one gram, is dissolved in a large excess of\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, the digestion being continued at near the\r\nboiling-point, with frequent stirring, for at least two hours. The\r\nsolution is made alkaline, filtered, and the residue washed and dried\r\nto constant weight.\r\n\r\n(2) _Sulfuric Acid._—The washings and filtrate from the above\r\ndetermination are made up to a definite volume with water and divided\r\ninto two equal parts. The sulfuric acid is estimated in one part by\r\nadding to it sodium carbonate until the acidity is nearly neutralized.\r\nThe sulfuric acid is then thrown down at near boiling temperature by\r\nthe gradual addition of barium chlorid solution. The barium sulfate\r\nformed is separated, washed, dried, and weighed in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n(3) _Iron and Alumina._—To the other half of the solution a little\r\nnitric acid is added and boiled to convert any ferrous into ferric\r\niron. On the addition of ammonia the iron and alumina are separated as\r\nhydroxids, collected on a gooch, washed, dried, ignited, and weighed as\r\noxids.\r\n\r\n(4) In the filtrate the lime is thrown out as oxalate, and separated\r\nand weighed in the usual way as oxid. One part of CaO is equal to\r\n2.4286 parts of CaSO₄.\r\n\r\n(5) _Moisture._—Dry about two grams of the sample to constant weight at\r\n80°.\r\n\r\n(6) _Water of Crystallization._—Heat the residue from the above to\r\n150°, until a constant weight is obtained. The loss represents water of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\n(7) _Carbonates._—Determine the quantity of carbon dioxid evolved by\r\nthe usual process, and calculate the calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n=286. Solution in Sodium Carbonate.=—Gypsum is also easily decomposed\r\nby boiling with a solution of about ten times its weight of sodium\r\ncarbonate. The calcium, by this operation, is converted into carbonate\r\nand can be collected on a gooch, washed, and estimated as usual, but\r\nin this case it will contain all the insoluble matters, from which the\r\nlime can be separated by solution in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIn the filtrate from the above separation the excess of sodium\r\ncarbonate is removed by the addition of hydrochloric to slight acidity,\r\nand the sulfuric acid estimated as described in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nPure gypsum has a composition represented by the following formula:\r\nCaSO₄·H₂O.\r\n\r\nIt contains:\r\n\r\n    Sulfur dioxid    46.51 per cent.\r\n    Lime             32.56  “   “\r\n    Water            20.93  “   “\r\n\r\nA commercial sample of ordinary gypsum should have about the following\r\ncomposition:[244]\r\n\r\n    CaSO₄·H₂O                 88.15 per cent.\r\n    CaCO₃                      3.50  “   “\r\n    Fe₂O₃ and Al₂O₃            1.50  “   “\r\n    Insoluble                  2.80  “   “\r\n    Organic matter             0.50  “   “\r\n    Water and undetermined     3.55  “   “\r\n\r\n=287. Common Salt.=—Common salt is highly esteemed in many quarters as\r\na top dressing for lawns and meadows, and also for cultivated crops.\r\nIts action is chiefly of a mechanical and katalytic nature, since it\r\ndoes not form a very large percentage of the mineral food of plants.\r\nOn account of its affinity for moisture it is also said to have\r\nsome value as a condenser and carrier of water in times of drouth.\r\nOn account of its great cheapness, selling often for less than ten\r\ndollars a ton, its use in moderate quantity entails no great expense.\r\nIts ability, however, to pay for its own use in the increased harvest\r\nis of a doubtful character when it is applied at a cost of more than\r\na few dollars per acre. In the chemical examination of a sample of\r\ncommon salt which is to be used as a fertilizer, a complete analysis\r\nis rarely necessary. When desired it can be conducted according to the\r\nusual methods of mineral analysis. For practical purposes the moisture,\r\ninsoluble matter, magnesia and chlorin should be determined and the\r\nquantity of sodium chlorid calculated from the latter number. Traces of\r\niodin or bromin which may be present are of no consequence.\r\n\r\nThe moisture is determined by drying two grams of the well-mixed and\r\nfinely-powdered sample to constant weight at 100°. The chlorin is\r\nobtained by precipitation of an aliquot part of a solution of the salt\r\nby set silver nitrate, using potassium chromate as indicator.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of insoluble matter it should not be forgotten\r\nthat a little gypsum may be present, and this should be dissolved by\r\nrubbing to a finer powder and by repeated digestion in water. The\r\nmagnesia and lime are separated and determined in the usual manner. If\r\nthe quantity of gypsum present be sufficient to warrant it the sulfuric\r\nacid may be separated and weighed in the manner already described.\r\nCommon salt when present in the soil in proportions greater than\r\none-tenth per cent is injurious to vegetation.\r\n\r\n=288. Green Vitriol.=—When iron is used as a fertilizer it is\r\nusually applied as ferrous sulfate. The value of iron in a soil is\r\nincontestable and by reason of the fact that fertile soils are always\r\nwell aerated the iron present in the arable layer is found in the\r\nferric state. When green vitriol is applied to the soil it undergoes\r\ngradual oxidation and appears finally in a more highly oxidized\r\nform. Iron acts directly on the plant in promoting the development\r\nof the chlorophyll cells, and is also found in almost all parts of\r\nthe vegetable organism. A too great quantity of ferrous sulfate is\r\ndestructive of plant growth in which respect it resembles common salt.\r\nIt should therefore be applied with due regard to the dangers which\r\nmight arise from an excessive quantity. It is not likely, however, that\r\nwhen applied in a finely powdered state at the rate of from two to four\r\nhundred pounds per acre it would ever prove poisonous to vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the analysis of a sample of green vitriol it will be sufficient to\r\ndetermine the moisture, water of crystallization, iron, and sulfuric\r\nacid. The moisture may be ascertained by drying the finely powdered\r\nsample over sulfuric acid for a few hours. The water of crystallization\r\nis separated by exposing the sample to a temperature of 285° for two\r\nhours. The iron may be determined by oxidizing to the ferrous state\r\nby boiling with nitric acid and then precipitating with ammonia,\r\nand proceeding as directed for iron analysis. The sulfuric acid is\r\nseparated as barium sulfate and determined as already directed.\r\n\r\n=289. Stall Manures.=—There are no definite methods to be described for\r\nthe analyses of that large class of valuable fertilizer produced in the\r\nstable and pen, and which collectively may be called stall manures. The\r\nmethods of sampling have already been described,[245] but only patience\r\nand tact will enable the collector to get a fair representation of the\r\nwhole mass. These manures are a mixture of urine, excrement, waste\r\nfragments of fodder, and the bedding used for the animals. With them\r\nmay also be included the night soil and waste from human habitations\r\nand the garbage from cities. All of these bodies contain valuable plant\r\nfoods and the phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen therein are to be\r\ndetermined by the methods already given for these bodies when they\r\noccur in, or are mixed with, organic matter. In general, stall manures\r\nare found to have a higher manurial value than is indicated by the\r\namount of phosphorus, potash, and nitrogen which they contain. Through\r\nthem there is introduced into the soil large quantities of humus bodies\r\nwhereby the physical state of the soil is profoundly modified and its\r\nadaptability to the growth of crops, as a rule increased. The addition\r\nof active nitrifying ferments in stall manure is also advantageous.\r\nStall manures, however, may in many cases prove to be injurious to a\r\ncrop, as for instance, when they are applied in a poorly decomposed\r\nstate and in a season deficient in moisture.\r\n\r\nIt is essential therefore that the bedding of animals be in a finely\r\ndivided state, whereby not only are the absorptive powers of the\r\norganic matter increased but also the conditions for their speedy decay\r\nfavored. To avoid the loss of ammonia arising from decomposing urine it\r\nis advisable to compost the stall manure with gypsum or to sprinkle it\r\nfrom time to time with oil of vitriol.\r\n\r\nIn the analysis the moisture may be estimated by drying a weighed\r\nportion of the sample to constant weight at 100° or at a lower\r\ntemperature in a vacuum. The potash and phosphoric acid are determined\r\nas usual, with previous careful incineration, and the nitrogen secured\r\nby the moist combustion process.\r\n\r\n=290. Hen Manure.=—This fertilizing substance is a mixture of the\r\nexcrement of the fowl yard with feathers, dust, and other débris.\r\nMeasured by the standard applied to commercial fertilizers hen manure\r\nhas a low value. As in the case of other farm manures, however, it\r\nproduces effects quite out of proportion to the amount of ordinary\r\nplant foods which it contains. In a sample examined at the Connecticut\r\nstation the percentages of fertilizing constituents were found to be\r\nthe following[246]:\r\n\r\n    Water                         51.84\r\n    Organic and volatile matters  24.27\r\n    Ash                           23.89\r\n\r\nThe organic matter contained 0.61 per cent of nitrogen as ammonia and\r\nthe ash 0.97 per cent of phosphoric acid, and 0.59 per cent of potash,\r\nall calculated to the original weight of the sample. The percentage of\r\nwater in this sample is undoubtedly higher than the average, so that it\r\ncan hardly be taken to represent the true composition of this manure.\r\nThe potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen are to be determined by some\r\none of the standard methods already described, the two former after\r\ncareful incineration.\r\n\r\n=291. Guanos and Cave Deposits.=—The principal constituents of value\r\nin these deposits are nitrogen and phosphoric acid. The other organic\r\nmatters are also of some value but have no commercial rating. The\r\nnitrogen may be present in all its forms; _viz._, organic, ammoniacal,\r\namid, and nitric, and for this reason is well suited not only to supply\r\nnourishment to the plant in the earlier stages of its growth but also\r\nto cater to its later wants. In guano deposits in caves, due usually to\r\nthe presence of bats, similar forms of fertilizers are found and the\r\nsoluble constituents due to decay and nitrification are protected from\r\nthe leaching to which they would be subjected in the open air.\r\n\r\nIn many localities in the United States these deposits are found, but\r\nthe humidity of our climate has prevented the immense open deposits of\r\nguano that characterize some of the arid islands of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nMany bat guanos examined in this laboratory have also been found to\r\ncontain potash, in one case 1.78 per cent. It is suggested therefore\r\nthat the analyst do not omit to examine each sample qualitatively for\r\nthis substance and to determine its amount when indications point to\r\nits presence in weighable proportions. In the many samples of bat guano\r\nof American origin which have been analyzed in this laboratory in the\r\nlast few years some very rich in plant food have been found. In one\r\ninstance the total percentage of nitrogen present, was 10.11 per cent.\r\nIn some cases the phosphoric acid is high but rarely in conjunction\r\nwith a high content of nitrogen. In one instance where the total\r\nphosphoric acid reached 14.53 per cent, the content of nitrogen was\r\n4.87 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the processes of analysis there are no especial\r\ndirections to be given. The phosphoric acid, as given below, and the\r\npotash are to be determined by the usual methods, the total phosphoric\r\nacid and potash after the destruction of the organic matter.\r\n\r\nIn old cave deposits the processes of decay and nitrification seem\r\nto have long been completed and we have found very little power of\r\ninducing nitrification in culture solutions seeded from these samples.\r\n\r\n=292. French Official Method for Total Phosphoric Acid in Guanos.=—To\r\ndetermine the phosphoric acid in guanos, the method officially adopted\r\nby the French agricultural chemists may be used.[247]\r\n\r\nTwo grams of the sample are rubbed up in a porcelain crucible with\r\na decigram of slaked lime to prevent the possible reduction of the\r\nphosphoric acid by the organic matter. The mixture is slightly\r\nmoistened with a few drops of water, dried on a sand-bath, and\r\nafterwards heated to redness, best in a muffle, until organic matter is\r\ndestroyed. The contents of the crucible are detached and placed in a\r\nflask of 200 cubic centimeters capacity. The crucible is well digested\r\ntwice with some hydrochloric acid to dissolve any adhering fragments,\r\nand finally washed with hot water, the acid and water being added to\r\nthe flask. The contents of the flask are boiled for fifteen minutes and\r\nthen poured into a flat-bottomed dish, the flask well rinsed three or\r\nfour times with small quantities of water, and the liquor and washings\r\nare evaporated to dryness to render the silica insoluble. The residue\r\nis taken up by a mixture of ten cubic centimeters each of hydrochloric\r\nacid and water, heated for a few minutes and filtered, and the dish\r\nwell washed with successive small portions of water, but the total\r\nvolume of the filtrate and washings should not exceed eighty cubic\r\ncentimeters. In this filtrate the phosphoric acid may be determined by\r\nany one of the approved methods.\r\n\r\n=293. Waste Leather.=—This material belongs probably to that class\r\nof nitrogenous substances which has already been considered in\r\nparagraph =149=. The chief manurial value of the waste is found in its\r\nnitrogenous content. The value of this for available plant food has\r\nbeen investigated by Lindsey.[248] A complete resumé of the literature\r\nof the subject is also given by him.\r\n\r\nThe best way of identifying leather waste is by the process proposed\r\nby Dabney.[249] It depends on the color produced in a solution of iron\r\nphosphate by the tannin compounds derived from the leather. The reagent\r\nis prepared by dissolving a freshly made precipitate of iron phosphate\r\nfrom ten grams of ferric chlorid in 400 cubic centimeters of an aqueous\r\nsolution of forty grams of glacial phosphoric acid. A gentle heat\r\npromotes the solution of the phosphate.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a fertilizer supposed to contain leather, about one\r\ngram of the material is treated with thirty cubic centimeters of water\r\nand a few drops of sulfuric acid. The mixture is boiled and poured\r\non a filter. To a portion of the filtrate some of the solution of\r\niron phosphate is added, and the mixture made alkaline with ammonia.\r\nIf leather be present in the sample, a purple or wine color will be\r\ndeveloped. Lindsey could easily detect the leather when it was added in\r\nten per cent quantities by the above method, and he regards this method\r\nas superior to the microscope which is unreliable in the case of finely\r\nground material.\r\n\r\nWhile leather, as such, decays slowly, and therefore is not at once\r\navailable for the nourishment of plants it acquires greater utility\r\nafter digestion in sulfuric acid. Artificial digestion experiments with\r\nleather previously treated with sulfuric acid show that, approximately,\r\nseventy per cent of the nitrogen pass into solution. Such a prepared\r\nleather has, therefore, a digestive coefficient in respect of nitrogen\r\nnot much inferior to most organic bodies.\r\n\r\nIn comparative trials with sodium nitrate it was demonstrated that\r\nnitrogen in leather, previously dissolved in sulfuric acid, has a rank\r\nof about sixty when it is rated at one hundred in the soda salt.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of the nitrogen in leather the moist combustion\r\nprocess is to be preferred.\r\n\r\n=294. Analysis of Wood Ashes.=—The only kinds of ashes used extensively\r\nfor manurial purposes are those derived from the burning of hard woods.\r\nThe ash of soft woods, such as the pine, is too poor in plant foods to\r\nwarrant its transportation to any great distance for manurial purposes.\r\nThe methods of incineration of organic bodies for the purpose of\r\nobtaining and estimating their mineral contents will be fully discussed\r\nin the third volume of this work.\r\n\r\nIt is important in ash analysis to know whether there be enough of iron\r\npresent to combine with all the phosphoric acid. For manurial purposes\r\nit will be found sufficient to determine the percentages of potash and\r\nphosphoric acid alone. For hygienic purposes it is advisable to examine\r\nthe ash qualitatively and, if necessary, quantitatively for zinc, lead,\r\ncopper, boric acid, and other bodies of a similar character which\r\nmay be naturally present in the ash, or may have been added to the\r\norganic substance from which it was prepared for preservation or other\r\npurposes. The methods of making these special investigations will be\r\ndiscussed in the succeeding volume. At present will be given, however,\r\nnot only the methods for detecting phosphoric acid and potash, but also\r\nfor a complete analysis of an ash in so far as its usual constituents\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\n=295. Carbon, Sand, and Silica.=—The official agricultural chemists\r\nhave recommended the following procedure for the determination of the\r\nunburned carbon, and the sand and silica.[250]\r\n\r\nFive grams of the ash are treated in a beaker, covered with a\r\nwatch glass with fifty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of\r\n1.115 specific gravity, and digested on the water-bath until all\r\neffervescence has ceased. The cover is then removed and the liquid\r\nevaporated to complete dryness to render the silica insoluble.\r\nThe residue is moistened with two or three cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid and taken up with about fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, allowed to stand on the water-bath a few minutes, filtered,\r\nand thoroughly washed. The filtrate and washings are made up to a\r\nquarter of a liter for analysis. The residue is washed from the\r\nfilter into a platinum dish and boiled about five minutes with twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of a saturated solution of pure sodium carbonate;\r\nafterwards a few drops of pure sodium hydroxid solution are added\r\nand the liquid allowed to settle, and it is then decanted through a\r\ntared gooch. The residue is boiled with sodium carbonate solution and\r\ndecanted as before, a second and a third time, and finally brought\r\nupon the felt and thoroughly washed, first with hot water, then with\r\na little dilute hydrochloric acid, and finally with hot water until\r\nfree of chlorids. The residue in the gooch is dried at 110° to constant\r\nweight, giving the carbon and sand. It is then incinerated and the\r\nweight of the sand determined, the difference giving the carbon. It\r\nis advisable to examine the sand with a microscope to determine if it\r\nbe pure. The alkaline filtrate and washings from the carbon and sand\r\nare acidified with hydrochloric, evaporated to dryness, and the silica\r\nseparated and determined in the usual way.\r\n\r\nInstead of determining soluble silica directly from the sodium\r\ncarbonate solution, as above, another portion of the ash may be treated\r\nwith hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness as before described,\r\nfiltered on an ordinary filter, washed, burned, and weighed, giving the\r\nweight of silica plus sand, from which the weight of sand is deducted\r\nto obtain soluble silica. It is inadmissible to separate the soluble\r\nsilica from the residue after it has been ignited.\r\n\r\nInstead of limiting the quantity of hydrochloric acid used for\r\nmoistening the dried residue, as suggested above by the official\r\nchemists, enough should be employed to fully saturate the mass. The\r\nweight of pure ash is obtained by subtracting from the weight of the\r\nsample taken the sum of the weights of carbon, sand, and carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\n=296. Ferric Phosphate and the Alkaline Earths.=—The ferric phosphate,\r\nlime, magnesia, and manganese are determined in an aliquot part of the\r\nfirst hydrochloric acid solution and washings obtained above. Fifty\r\nor one hundred cubic centimeters may be used, corresponding to one or\r\ntwo grams of the original ash. The accurately measured quantity of\r\nthe solution is carefully treated with ammonia until the precipitate\r\nformed on its addition becomes permanent on shaking. Ammonium acetate\r\nand acetic acid are then added until the mixture has assumed a strongly\r\nacid reaction. The separation of the ferric phosphate precipitate is\r\npromoted by gentle warming, and it is separated by filtration without\r\nunnecessary delay. If the precipitate be not large the sample contains\r\nno manganese and alumina in weighable quantities, and if the filtrate\r\nbe not red the precipitate be washed with hot water containing a\r\nlittle ammonium nitrate. It is then ignited and weighed as Fe₂P₂O₈\r\nand the quantity of ferric oxid computed therefrom. If, however, the\r\nprecipitate be large it is well washed as above and then dissolved in\r\nas small a quantity as possible of hydrochloric acid, and the solution\r\nis again precipitated as above by the addition of ammonia, ammonium\r\nacetate, and acetic acid. The ferric phosphate obtained by the second\r\nprecipitation is treated exactly as above described.\r\n\r\nIn case, however, any weighable quantities of manganese or alumina are\r\npresent it will not do to weigh the precipitate of ferric phosphate\r\ndirectly even after a second precipitation. Also if the filtrate at\r\nfirst obtained have a red color the precipitate may contain basic\r\nferric phosphate. In this latter case it should be ignited and weighed,\r\nthen dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the ferric oxid estimated\r\nin the solution and from the difference the quantity of combined\r\nphosphoric acid calculated.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the iron from the phosphoric acid may be accomplished\r\nby adding tartaric acid to the hydrochloric acid solution of the iron\r\nphosphate above obtained and then ammonium chlorid and ammonia. The\r\nmixture is placed in a flask and ammonium sulfid added. The flask\r\nis closed, placed in a warm place, and allowed to stand until the\r\nsupernatant liquid is clear and of a pure yellow color without a trace\r\nof green. The iron is separated by filtration, washed, dissolved, and\r\nestimated in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf manganese and alumina be present the iron and manganese are\r\nseparated from the phosphoric acid and alumina by the processes\r\njust given for the separation of iron from phosphoric acid. In the\r\nfiltrate the alumina and phosphoric acid are separated as follows:\r\nThe filtrate is evaporated in a platinum dish after the addition\r\nof an excess of pure sodium carbonate until no ammonia is set free\r\nby a further addition of the carbonate. Some nitric acid is then\r\nadded and the evaporation continued to dryness. The residue is fused\r\nand after cooling softened with water, washed into a small beaker,\r\nsome hydrochloric acid added, warmed, and filtered. Ammonia is next\r\nadded until the reaction is alkaline. If no precipitate be produced\r\nno alumina is present. In this case more nitric acid is added, the\r\nsolution again evaporated, and the phosphoric acid determined by the\r\nusual methods.\r\n\r\nIn case a precipitate is formed, showing the presence of alumina,\r\nnitric acid is added until the precipitate is dissolved, and then in\r\nslight excess and after evaporation the phosphoric acid separated\r\nby molybdic solution and determined as usual. From the filtrate the\r\nexcess of molybdic acid is removed by hydrogen sulfid and the alumina\r\ndetermined in the filtrate: Or the alumina may be determined directly\r\nin the hydrochloric acid solution of the melt above obtained as\r\naluminum phosphate by adding sodium phosphate, ammonia and acetic acid.\r\nThe aluminum phosphate is separated by filtration and determined in the\r\nusual manner. The phosphoric acid is then determined in another aliquot\r\npart of the original filtrate from the first solution of the ash.\r\n\r\nSince most ashes contain an excess of phosphoric acid above the\r\nquantity required to combine with the iron it is preferable to proceed\r\non that basis as described in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n=297. Method Used in this Laboratory.=—The principle of the method\r\nrests on the assumption that all the phosphoric acid may be removed\r\nfrom the solution by the careful addition of iron chlorid. Any excess\r\nof iron is then removed by ammonium acetate and the manganese, lime,\r\nand magnesia, are separated in the filtrate. The percentage of iron is\r\ndetermined by reduction of the iron in another portion of the solution\r\nand titration with potassium permanganate. The process as conducted by\r\nMcElroy, is as follows:[251]\r\n\r\n_Moisture._—If the ash contain much carbon the water is best determined\r\nby drying in vacuo to avoid oxidation.\r\n\r\n_Sand, Silica, and Carbon._—Place a portion of the ash in a weighed\r\nplatinum dish, weigh, and cover the sample with hydrochloric acid of\r\n1.115 specific gravity. Evaporate to dryness on the water-bath, and\r\nthen heat for fifteen minutes at 105° to 110° in an air-bath. Repeat\r\nthe treatment with acid and drying: Finally cover with a third portion\r\nof acid and digest on the water-bath for an hour or two. Filter into a\r\nweighed gooch and wash the residue free of chlorids. The gooch is best\r\nweighed with the dish to avoid the necessity of transferring the silica\r\nwhich may adhere to the sides of the former. Dry at a few degrees above\r\nthe boiling temperature of water and weigh. Where the ash contains\r\nmuch charcoal the drying is best done in a vacuum at 60° to 70°. The\r\nincrease in weight found represents sand, silica, and carbon: Burn and\r\nreweigh. The loss is carbon.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of ash is treated as before except that it is filtered\r\nthrough a paper filter. The filtrate is united with that of the\r\nprevious sample in a graduated flask. When the washing is completed\r\nthe filter is placed in the dish, a weak solution of caustic soda\r\nadded, and the mixture heated on the water-bath for some time. Decant\r\nwhile hot through a fresh filter and retreat the residue in the dish\r\nwith another portion of alkali. Finally wash with hot water till the\r\nalkaline reaction disappears, then with weak hydrochloric acid, then\r\nwith water until chlorids disappear. The washed mass on the filter\r\nis transferred to a platinum dish and ignited. The weight obtained\r\nrepresents sand.\r\n\r\n_Separation of Phosphoric Acid._—The united filtrates from the two\r\ndeterminations are placed in a graduated flask and made up to the\r\nmark. An aliquot portion of this solution representing half a gram of\r\nthe original ash or any other convenient quantity is transferred to a\r\nbeaker and a solution of ferric chlorid added until ammonia produces\r\na brown precipitate in the mixture. Neutralize with ammonia and\r\nhydrochloric acid alternately until the liquid is as little acid as it\r\ncan be and still remain clear. Add from ten to twenty cubic centimeters\r\nof a solution of sodium acetate (1:10) and bring to a boil. The liquid\r\nshould be quite dilute. Filter and wash free of chlorids with boiling\r\nwater containing some sodium acetate.\r\n\r\n_Manganese._—Make the filtrate faintly alkaline with ammonia and add\r\nammonium sulfid. Any manganese sulfid which may form is separated by\r\nfiltration, treated with dilute acetic acid and the resulting solution,\r\nwhich should be clear, heated to boiling, nearly neutralized with\r\ncaustic soda, and mixed with bromin water. The resultant manganese\r\ndioxid is to be filtered into a gooch, ignited and weighed as Mn₃O₄.\r\n\r\n_Lime._—Reacidify the filtrate from the manganese sulfid with acetic\r\nacid, heat to boiling and add ammonium oxalate: Allow to stand over\r\nnight, filter through a gooch and wash with water containing acetic\r\nacid. The calcium oxalate can be weighed as such, but it is preferable\r\nto dry thoroughly and then heat in a small bunsen flame until a change\r\ncan be noted passing over the precipitate. If this is carefully done\r\nthe residue will be calcium carbonate. In any case the result is to be\r\nchecked by igniting over the blast lamp to constant weight and weighing\r\nthe lime thus obtained.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia._—In the filtrate the magnesia can be determined by sodium\r\nphosphate in the usual manner. In very accurate work the calcium\r\noxalate obtained as directed above can be dissolved and reprecipitated,\r\nand the magnesia in the filtrate added to that in the first filtrate.\r\n\r\n_Iron._—For iron another aliquot portion of the original solution is\r\ntaken, acidified with sulfuric evaporated to drive off hydrochloric\r\nacid, rediluted and passed through the Jones reductor described in\r\nparagraph =112=. The filtrate is titrated with potassium permanganate\r\nsolution in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n_Alkalies._—For the alkalies another aliquot portion is taken and\r\nprecipitated while hot, with barium chlorid and barium hydrate,\r\nfiltered, and ammonia and ammonium carbonate added to remove the\r\nexcess of barium salt. Refilter, evaporate to dryness in a platinum\r\ndish, and ignite gently to expel all ammonia salts, repeat this\r\noperation after taking up with water and finally heat to constant\r\nweight. The weight obtained represents a mixture of potassium and\r\nsodium chlorids, with usually carbon derived from impurities in\r\nthe ammonia. A little magnesia is often present. The potassium is\r\nestimated by means of platinum solution, and the potassium chlorid\r\nfound deducted from the total weight gives the sodium chlorid. The\r\ncarbon is usually unweighable, though it often looks as if present in\r\nconsiderable quantity. It may be estimated, however, by dissolving the\r\nmixed chlorids in weak hydrochloric acid and filtering through a gooch\r\nbefore making the potassium estimation. The estimation of the magnesia\r\nremaining with the mixed chlorids may be effected by evaporating the\r\nalcoholic solution remaining after the precipitation of the potassium\r\nto dryness, redissolving in water, placing the solution in a flask\r\nprovided with gas tubulures, introducing hydrogen, and placing in the\r\nsunlight. The platinum is soon reduced, leaving the liquid colorless.\r\nHeating facilitates the reaction. Displace the hydrogen by a current\r\nof carbon dioxid, filter, concentrate the solution and precipitate the\r\nmagnesia by sodium phosphate in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid._—It is best to determine the phosphoric acid directly\r\nin an aliquot part of the first filtrate from the hydrochloric acid\r\nsolution of the ash obtained as described under the determinations of\r\nsand, silica and carbon. When there is not enough of the material for\r\nthis, the precipitate of ferric phosphate may be dissolved and the\r\nphosphoric acid determined after separation with ammonium molybdate.\r\n\r\n_Sulfuric Acid._—Fifty cubic centimeters of the original hydrochloric\r\nacid filtrate, obtained as described under the determinations of sand,\r\nsilica and carbon, are heated to boiling, and the sulfuric acid thrown\r\nout by the gradual addition of barium chlorid. During the precipitation\r\nthe mixture is kept at the boiling temperature, but taken from the\r\nlamp and the precipitate allowed to settle from time to time until\r\nit is seen that an additional drop of the reagent causes no further\r\nprecipitate. The barium sulfate is collected, dried, and weighed in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\n_Chlorin._—Dissolve from one to five grams of the ash in nitric acid\r\nin very slight excess, or in water. If the solution be made in nitric\r\nacid the excess must be neutralized if the chlorin be determined\r\nvolumetrically; and if the solution be in water, nitric acid must be\r\nadded if the determination be gravimetric.\r\n\r\nThe volumetric determination is accomplished in the usual manner\r\nwith a standard silver nitrate solution, using potassium chromate as\r\nindicator. The gravimetric determination is effected by precipitation\r\nwith silver nitrate, collecting, washing, and drying at 150° the silver\r\nchlorid obtained.\r\n\r\n_Carbon Dioxid._—The carbon dioxid is most conveniently estimated\r\nin from one to five grams of the ash, according to its richness in\r\ncarbonates, by the apparatus described in volume first, or some similar\r\ndevice.[252]\r\n\r\n=298. Official Method for Determinations of the Alkalies.=—Evaporate\r\nthe filtrate and washings from the sulfuric acid determination,\r\nparagraph =297=, in a porcelain dish to dryness, redissolve in about\r\nfifty cubic centimeters of water and add milk of lime, or barium\r\nhydroxid solution, which must be perfectly free from alkalies, until\r\nno further precipitation is produced, and it is evident there is\r\nan excess of calcium hydroxid or barium hydroxid present; boil for\r\ntwo or three minutes, filter hot, and wash thoroughly with boiling\r\nwater, precipitate the lime and baryta from the filtrate with ammonia\r\nand ammonium carbonate, filter, evaporate the filtrate to dryness\r\nin a porcelain dish, and drive off the ammonia salts by heat below\r\nredness.[253] When cold, redissolve in fifteen or twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, precipitate again with a few drops of ammonia and\r\nammonium carbonate solution, let stand a few minutes on the water-bath\r\nand filter into a tared platinum dish and evaporate to dryness, expel\r\nthe ammonia salts by heating to just perceptible dull redness, weigh\r\nthe potassium and sodium chlorids obtained and determine the potassium\r\nchlorid with platinic chlorid as usual.\r\n\r\nThe potassium may also be determined by the perchlorate method, or\r\nthe total chlorin be determined volumetrically, and the relative\r\npercentages of potassium and sodium chlorids calculated by the usual\r\nformula: Or multiply the weight of chlorin in the mixture by 2.1035,\r\ndeduct from the product the total weight of the chlorids and multiply\r\nthe remainder by 3.6358. The product expresses the weight of the sodium\r\nchlorid contained in the mixed salts. The indirect method is only\r\napplicable when there are considerable quantities of alkalies present\r\nand where they exist in approximately molecular proportions. It is\r\ntherefore a process rarely to be recommended in ash analysis.\r\n\r\n=299. Statement of Results.=—The bases which are found present in the\r\nashes of wood and other vegetable tissues exist without doubt before\r\nincineration, chiefly in combination with inorganic acids. Even the\r\nphosphorus and sulfur which after ignition appear as phosphates and\r\nsulfates, have previous thereto existed in an organic form to a large\r\nextent. The silica itself is profoundly modified in the organism of\r\nthe growing plant and doubtless does not exist there in the purely\r\nmineral form in which it is found in the ash. During the progress of\r\nincineration, with proper precautions, all the phosphorus and sulfur\r\nare oxidized and appear as phosphoric and sulfuric acids. The silica is\r\nreduced to a mineral state, and if a high heat be employed silicates\r\nare formed. The organic salts of lime, magnesia and other bases at\r\na low temperature are converted into carbonates, and if a higher\r\ntemperature be used, may appear as oxids. The organic compounds of\r\nalkalies will be found in the ash as carbonates. It would be useless,\r\ntherefore, to try to state the results of ash analysis in forms of\r\ncombination similar to those existing in the original vegetable\r\ntissues. It is not certain even that we can in all cases judge of the\r\nform of combination in which the different constituents exist in the\r\nash itself. It is therefore to be preferred in a statement of ash\r\nanalysis to give the bases in the form of oxids, and the sulfur and\r\nphosphorus in the form of anhydrids, and the chlorin in its elementary\r\nstate. In this case an equivalent amount of oxygen to the chlorin found\r\nmust be subtracted from the total. If an attempt be made to combine\r\nthe acid and basic elements the chlorin should first be united with\r\nsodium, and any excess thereof with potassium, and the amount of base\r\nso combined calculated to oxid and deducted from the total of such\r\nbase or bases present. The carbonic acid present should be combined\r\nfirst with alkalies after the chlorin has been supplied. The phosphoric\r\nacid should be combined first with the iron and afterwards with lime\r\nor magnesia. In all cases the percentages should be based upon the\r\nash, after the carbon and sand have been deducted, or it is also\r\nconvenient at times to throw out of the results the carbon dioxid and\r\nto calculate the other constituents to the ash free of that substance.\r\nIn determining the quantities of mineral matters removed from soil by\r\ncrops, the ash should be determined with great care, freed of carbon\r\nand sand, and the calculations made on the percentage thus secured. In\r\nall statements of percentages of the essential constituents of ash,\r\nas regards fertilizing materials, it should be specified whether the\r\npercentage is calculated on a crude ash, the pure ash, that is free\r\nof carbon and sand, or upon a basis excluding the carbon dioxid. For\r\nthe purpose of fertilizer control, the analyst and dealer will be\r\nsatisfied, as a rule, with the determination of the percentages of\r\nphosphoric acid and potash alone. To the other constituents of an ash\r\nis not assigned any commercial value.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FOURTH.\r\n\r\n[239] Compiled for author by Mr. K. P.
