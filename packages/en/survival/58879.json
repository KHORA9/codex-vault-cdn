Its Origin and Meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only true and right way of learning geography (which in its\r\nwidest sense comprehends almost everything connected with the earth)\r\nis to become acquainted with the geography--or, strictly speaking,\r\nthe topography--and history of the district in which we live.\r\nModern England is split up into a number of main divisions known as\r\n_counties_, and in some instances also as _shires_; the word _shire_,\r\nwhen it is used, being added at the end of the county name. Thus we\r\nhave the county of Essex or the county of Hertford; but whereas in\r\nthe former case the word _shire_ is never added, it may be in the\r\ncase of the latter. We then have either the county of Hertford, or\r\nHertfordshire, as the full designation of the territorial unit in\r\nwhich we dwell. In official documents our area is always mentioned\r\nunder the title of the “County of Hertford”; but imperfectly educated\r\npersons when filling in such documents frequently write the “County of\r\nHertfordshire.” This is wrong and superfluous; shire being equivalent\r\nto county.\r\n\r\nThe word _county_ signifies an area of which a _count_ or _earl_ is\r\nthe titular head. Here it may be incidentally mentioned that the\r\ntitle “Earl” is of Saxon origin, which it was attempted to replace\r\nafter the Conquest by the Norman-French “Count”; the attempt being\r\nsuccessful only in the case of an Earl’s consort, who is still known\r\nas “Countess.” It also obtained in the case of “County,” which is thus\r\npractically equivalent to “Earldom.”\r\n\r\nIt now remains to enquire why some counties are also known as shires,\r\nwhile others are not thus designated. In Anglo-Saxon times England,\r\nin place of being one great kingdom, was split up into a number of\r\npetty kingdoms, each ruled by a separate sovereign. Essex was then a\r\nkingdom by itself, situated in the east of the country; while Wessex\r\nwas a western kingdom, and Mercia a sovereignty more in the heart of\r\nthe country. Essex and Sussex, being small kingdoms, were constituted\r\ncounties by themselves when the country came under a single dominion,\r\nand their names have consequently remained without addition or\r\nalteration from Anglo-Saxon times to our own day. The larger kingdoms,\r\nsuch as Wessex and Mercia, were, on the other hand, split up into\r\n_shares_, or _shires_,--i.e. that which is shorn or cut off--and their\r\nnames have disappeared except as items in history. Hertfordshire, then,\r\nis in great part a _share_ of the ancient kingdom of Mercia, of which,\r\nindeed, it seems to have formed a centre, as the Mercian kings spent at\r\nleast a portion of their time at Berghamstedt (Berkhampstead). It is\r\nhowever only the larger western portion of the county that belonged to\r\nMercia, a smaller area on the eastern side originally being included\r\nin the kingdom of Essex.\r\n\r\nAs to the meaning of the name Hertford, there has been some difference\r\nof opinion among archaeologists. In that extremely ancient chronicle,\r\n“Domesday Book,” the name, it appears, is spelt Herudsford, which is\r\ninterpreted as meaning “the red ford.” The more general and obvious\r\ninterpretation is, however, that of “hart’s-ford,” from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_heort_, a hart, or stag; and this explanation is supported by the\r\noccurrence in other parts of the country of such names as Oxford,\r\nHorseford, Gatford (= goat’s-ford), Fairford (= sheep’s-ford),\r\nand Swinford. Writing on this subject in a paper on Hertfordshire\r\nplace-names published in 1859, the Rev. Henry Hall, after alluding to\r\nthe custom of naming fords after animals, concluded as follows:--“At\r\nall events, the custom is so prevalent, and the word hart so common for\r\nAnglo-Saxon localities, as Hart’s-bath, Hartlepool (the Hart’s pool),\r\nHartly--that though several other derivations have been given for the\r\ncapital of the county, none seems so simple, or so satisfactory, as\r\nthat which interprets it to mean the hart’s ford.”\r\n\r\nThis interpretation has been adopted by that division of His Majesty’s\r\nlocal forces formerly known as the H_a_rtfordshire Militia. Possibly it\r\nis supported by the title of a neighbouring village, Hertingfordbury,\r\nthat is to say, the stronghold near Hertingford,--the ford at the\r\nhart’s meadow. Whether or not it has anything to do with the matter, it\r\nmay be worthy of mention that red-deer antlers occur in considerable\r\nabundance buried in the peat of Walthamstow, lower down the Lea valley,\r\nin Essex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. General Characteristics of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Hertfordshire: Station Road, Letchworth]\r\n\r\nHertford is an inland county, situated in the south-eastern portion of\r\nEngland, and cut off from the nearest sea by the whole width of Essex,\r\nwhich forms the greater portion of its eastern border. Neither has it\r\nany great river of its own communicating with the ocean; although the\r\nLea, which is navigable below Hertford, and falls into the Thames at\r\nBarking in Essex, affords the means of transporting malt (the great\r\noutput of Ware) and other products to London and elsewhere by water. As\r\nto canal communication, this will be discussed in a later section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Hertfordshire: Thatched Cottages, Harpenden]\r\n\r\nOriginally Hertford was essentially an agricultural county, as it is\r\nto a great extent at the present day; its northern three-quarters\r\nbeing noted for its production of corn. The southern portion, on the\r\nother hand, was partly a hay-growing and grazing country. Nowadays,\r\nhowever, more especially on the great lines of railway, conditions have\r\nmaterially altered; and large areas have become residential districts,\r\nwhich in the more southern part are little more than suburbs of the\r\nmetropolis. Printing-establishments and factories--moved from London\r\nfor the sake of cheapness--have likewise been set up on the outskirts\r\nof many of the larger towns, such as St Albans and Watford, or even in\r\nsome of the villages. On the other hand, the old-fashioned timbered and\r\ntiled or thatched cottages formerly so characteristic of the county are\r\nrapidly vanishing and giving place to the modern abominations in brick\r\nand slate. Gone, too, is the old-fashioned and picturesque smock-frock\r\nof the labourer and the shepherd, which was still much in evidence\r\nsome five and forty years ago, or even later; its disappearance being\r\naccompanied by the loss of many characteristic local words and phrases,\r\nto some of which reference will be made in a later section. The gangs\r\nof Irish mowers and reapers which used to perambulate the county at hay\r\nand harvest time are likewise a feature of the past.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the southern portion of the county differs--owing to\r\nits different geological formation--very markedly from that of the\r\nnorthern two-thirds; the latter area representing what may be called\r\ntypical Hertfordshire. Although there is nothing grand or striking in\r\nthe scenery of this part, for quiet and picturesque beauty--whether\r\nof the village with its ancient church nestling in the shelter of\r\nthe well-wooded valley, or the winding and tall-hedged lanes (where\r\nthey have been suffered to remain)--it would be hard to beat; and in\r\nmany instances is fully equal in charm to the much-vaunted Devonshire\r\nscenery, although, it is true, the hedge-banks lack the abundant\r\ngrowth of ferns characteristic of those of the latter county. Very\r\ncharacteristic of this part of the county are its open gorse or heath\r\ncommons, like those of Harpenden, Gustard Wood, Bower’s Heath, and\r\nBerkhampstead. From the higher chalk downs on the northern marches\r\nof the county extensive views may be obtained over the flats of\r\nBedfordshire and Cambridgeshire; while in like manner the southern\r\nrange of chalk hills in the neighbourhood of Elstree presents a\r\npanoramic view over the low-lying clay plains of the southern portion\r\nof the county and Middlesex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Old Farm-House near Wheathampstead]\r\n\r\nIn former days, it may be mentioned in this place, the inhabitants of\r\nmost, if not all, of the English counties had nicknames applied to them\r\nby their neighbours; “Hertfordshire Hedgehogs” being the designation\r\napplied to natives of this county, while their neighbours to the\r\neastward were dubbed “Essex Calves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Size. Shape. Boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maximum length of Hertfordshire, along a line running in a\r\nsouth-westerly and north-easterly direction, is about twenty-eight\r\nmiles; while its greatest breadth, along a line passing near its\r\ncentre from the neighbourhood of Tring to that of Bishop’s Stortford,\r\nis very nearly the same. Owing to its extremely irregular outline,\r\nthe county has, for its size, a very large circumference, measuring\r\napproximately 130 miles. Here it should be stated that the ancient area\r\nof the county differs somewhat from that of what is now known as the\r\nadministrative county. According to the census of 1901, the area of the\r\nancient, or geographical county, included 406,157 acres, whereas that\r\nof the administrative county is only 404,518 acres[1], or about 630\r\nsquare miles. The difference in these numbers is due to the fact that\r\ncertain portions of the old county, such as that part of the parish of\r\nCaddington originally included in Hertfordshire, have been transferred\r\nto adjacent counties. The figures relating to population, etc. given\r\nin the sequel refer to the administrative county.\r\n\r\n[1] In the _Report_ of the Board of Agriculture published in 1905 the\r\nnumber of acres is given as 402,856; and this is taken as the basis of\r\ncalculation in section 10 and in the diagrams.\r\n\r\nIn size Hertford may be reckoned a medium county, its acreage being\r\nrather less than that of Surrey, and about half that of Essex.\r\n\r\nTo describe the shape of Hertfordshire is almost an impossibility, on\r\naccount of its extremely irregular contour; but as its two maximum\r\ndiameters are approximately equal, it may be said to lie in a square,\r\nof which the four angles have been cut away to a greater or less extent\r\nin a curiously irregular manner. The reason of this irregular outline,\r\nseeing that only the eastern border is formed to any great extent by\r\na river-valley, is very difficult to guess. Where its south-eastern\r\nboundary leaves the Lea valley in the neighbourhood of Waltham Abbey,\r\nMiddlesex gives off from Enfield Chase a kind of peninsula running in\r\na north-westerly direction into Hertfordshire; while, in its turn,\r\nHertfordshire, a short distance to the south, sends a better-marked and\r\nirregular peninsula (in which stands Chipping Barnet) jutting far into\r\nMiddlesex. In consequence of this interlocking arrangement, a portion\r\nof Hertfordshire actually lies to the south of a part of Middlesex,\r\nalthough, as a whole, the former county is due north of the latter.\r\nAnother, but narrower, projection runs from the south-western corner of\r\nthe county in the neighbourhood of Rickmansworth so as to cut off the\r\nnorth-western corner of Middlesex from Buckinghamshire; while a third\r\nprominence, in which Tring is situated, is wedged into Buckinghamshire\r\nfrom the western side of the county. Other minor projections occur on\r\nthe north-western and northern border, of which the most pronounced\r\nis the one north of Baldock, jutting in between Bedfordshire and\r\nCambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nAs regards boundaries, Hertfordshire is bordered on the east by Essex,\r\nby Middlesex on the south, by Buckinghamshire on the south-west,\r\nby Bedfordshire on the north-west, and, to a small extent, by\r\nCambridgeshire on the north. From a short distance below the Rye\r\nHouse to Waltham Abbey the boundary between Hertfordshire and Essex\r\nis a natural one, formed by the rivers Stort and Lea; but the other\r\nboundaries of our county are, for the most part at any rate, purely\r\nartificial.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that these boundaries at the present day do not\r\neverywhere accord with those of half a century ago. The parish of\r\nCaddington was, for instance, in former days partly in Hertfordshire\r\nand partly in Bedfordshire, but under the provisions of the Local\r\nGovernment Act of 1888, confirmed in 1897, the whole of it was included\r\nin the latter county. Certain other alterations were made about the\r\nsame time in the boundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Surface and General Features.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contours of a district depend almost entirely upon the nature of\r\nits geological formations, and the action of rain, rivers, and frost\r\nupon the rocks of which they are composed. These formations in the case\r\nof this county are briefly described in a later section. Here it must\r\nsuffice to state that hard slaty rocks form jagged mountain ranges,\r\nwhile soft limestones like our Hertfordshire chalk weather into\r\nrounded dome-like hills and ridges, and heavy clays form flat plains.\r\nAs the bed-rock, or, as we may say, foundation, of Hertfordshire, is\r\nconstituted either by chalk or clay, it is the two latter types of\r\nscenery that mainly characterise this county. It is only, however, on\r\nthe north-western and northern borders of the county, as at Ivinghoe\r\nin Bucks, or between Sandon and Pirton, that we find typical chalk\r\nscenery, where the downs forming the north-easterly continuation of the\r\nChiltern Hills of Buckinghamshire enter our own area. Here we find the\r\nrounded downs and hollow combes characteristic of the South and North\r\nDowns of the south-eastern counties; and the same absence of woods,\r\nexcept where artificial foresting has been attempted. Some approach\r\nto true chalk scenery is likewise shown on the line of hills on the\r\nLondon side of Elstree, where they overlook the clay plain forming this\r\npart of northern Middlesex. There is, however, a difference in the\r\nscenery of this part as compared with that of the downs to the north\r\nin that these hills are partially covered with a capping of clay or\r\ngravel, while the beds or layers of which the chalk is composed slope\r\ntowards the plains at the base of the ridge instead of in the opposite\r\ndirection (see section on GEOLOGY).\r\n\r\nElsewhere the chalk is covered over to a greater or less degree, alike\r\non the hills and in the valleys, with thick deposits of clay, sand,\r\nand gravel. These communicate to the hills and valleys a contour quite\r\ndifferent from that of chalk downs; and in many parts of the county we\r\nhave a series of more or less nearly parallel lines of low undulating\r\nhills separated by wide, open valleys. Examples of this type of scenery\r\nare conspicuous in walking from the valley of the Ver at Redbourn\r\nacross the hill on which Rothamsted stands, then descending into the\r\nriverless valley of Harpenden, again crossing the hill to the east of\r\nthe latter, and then descending into the valley of the Lea near the\r\nGreat Northern railway station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical Hertfordshire Village: Much Hadham]\r\n\r\nThis capping of clay permits the growth of forest on the hills, as\r\ndo the alluvial deposits in the valleys; so that in its well-wooded\r\ncharacter the scenery of the greater part of the county is altogether\r\ndifferent from that characterising the bare North and South Downs and\r\nthe Chiltern Hills. Where the chalk comes near the surface there is\r\na marked tendency to the growth of beech-trees, splendid examples of\r\nwhich may be seen in Beechwood Park. Elsewhere in the chalk districts\r\nthe elm is the commonest timber-tree; although it should be said that\r\nthis species of tree was originally introduced into England from abroad.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the numerous open commons dotted\r\nover the chalk area of Hertfordshire. These appear to have been left\r\nas open spaces at the time the country was enclosed, owing to the\r\nsterility of their soil, which is unsuited for growing good crops of\r\neither corn or grass. Many of these commons, as in the neighbourhood\r\nof Harpenden, were enclosed some time previous to the battle of\r\nWaterloo, when corn in this country was so dear, and every available\r\npiece of land capable of growing wheat consequently of great value. It\r\nmay be presumed that the commons with the best soil were selected for\r\nenclosure; but most of such enclosed commons produce inferior crops,\r\npartly, it may be, owing to the plan on which they are cultivated.\r\nTill twenty years ago or thereabouts all such commons in the writer’s\r\nown neighbourhood were divided into a number of parallel strips,\r\nseparated by grass “baulks”; these strips representing the respective\r\nshares of the copyholders of the district, who had the right of grazing\r\non the original common. The absence of hedges rendered it necessary\r\nthat the same kind of crop should be grown each year on every plot.\r\nThis made it not worth the while of the occupiers to spend money on\r\nhigh cultivation. Of late years many of these enclosed commons have\r\neither been built over, or come under a single ownership, thereby\r\nobliterating one more interesting page in the history of the county.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Elstree range of chalk hills the scenery suddenly\r\nchanges, and on emerging into Middlesex from the tunnel through\r\nthese hills on the Midland Railway we enter an extensive grassy\r\nplain, characterised by its abundance of oak trees, the scarcity of\r\nelms, and the total absence of ash. Parts of this plain, which is\r\ncontinued through Middlesex to London, form the great grass-growing and\r\nhay-producing district of Eastern Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nA plain very similar in character to that south of Elstree is entered\r\nupon to the northward of Baldock, just after leaving the line of chalk\r\nhills, although the greater portion of this northern plain is situated\r\nin Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. When travelling northward from\r\nLondon by the Great Northern Railway, observant persons, after passing\r\nthrough the tunnels traversing the chalk hills north of Hitchin, cannot\r\nfail to notice the general flatness of the country as this great plain\r\nis entered. Although so like the southern plain in general appearance,\r\nthis northern plain, as is noticed in the section on Geology, is\r\ncomposed of much older rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bancroft, Hitchin]\r\n\r\nThe heights of some portions of the chalk area above mean sea-level\r\nare, for this part of England, considerable. Thus Great Offley Church\r\nis 554 feet, St Peter’s Church, St Albans, 402 feet, Stevenage 306\r\nfeet, Hitchin Church 216 feet, while a hill near Therfield attains the\r\nheight of 525 feet. Hastoe Hill near Tring is 709 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Watershed. Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commencing this section it will be well to devote a few lines to\r\nthe proper meaning of the frequently misunderstood term “watershed.”\r\nIt means the line of water-division, or water-parting; that is to say\r\nthe line along a range of hills from which the streams flow in one\r\ndirection on one side, and in the opposite direction on the other. The\r\nridge-tiles on a roof form an excellent illustration of a watershed.\r\n\r\nEvery local stream is separated from the one nearest to it by\r\na watershed; while a river-system, such as that of the Thames,\r\nis separated by a much more important watershed from the other\r\nriver-systems which take their origin near its source. Such\r\nriver-systems, each enclosed by a single watershed which it shares with\r\nits neighbours, are known as drainage-areas, or catchment-basins.\r\n\r\nPractically the whole of Hertfordshire lies in the Thames\r\ndrainage-area. At first sight it would be natural to suppose that the\r\nsummit of the line of chalk downs forming the continuation of the\r\nChiltern Hills in the neighbourhood of Tring and continuing thence to\r\nDunstable would constitute the watershed between two river-systems. But\r\nthis is not the case, for the Thames cuts through the Chiltern Hills\r\nbetween Wallingford and Pangbourne, and thus receives the drainage of\r\nboth the northern and the southern flanks of that range. The watershed\r\nformed by the continuation of the Chilterns in the Tring district is\r\ntherefore one of second-rate importance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the chalk hills near Hitchin we have a\r\nwatershed of first class, or primary rank, for it divides the Thames\r\ncatchment-area from that of the Great or Bedfordshire Ouse, which flows\r\ninto the North Sea miles away from the estuary of the Thames. Only\r\nfour comparatively small streams flowing into the Ouse basin lie for\r\npart or the whole of their course within the limits of the county. The\r\nfirst of these is the Pirre, or Purwell, a small brook which rises in\r\nthe parish of Ippolits, and, after passing Much Wymondley, flows into\r\nthe Hiz near Ickleford. The Hiz itself rises in a spring at Wellhead,\r\na short distance southward of Hitchin (formerly also called Hiz), and\r\nafter receiving the Purwell, flows to Ickleford, where it leaves the\r\ncounty, being joined in Bedfordshire by the Ivel, which rises not far\r\nfrom Baldock, passing Biggleswade to join the Ouse. Below Biggleswade\r\nit flows through Tempsford, where it unites with the Ouse. The last of\r\nthe four streams belonging to the Ouse system is the Rhee (a Saxon term\r\nsignifying a water-course or river), which springs strongly from the\r\nchalk a short distance west of Ashwell, and after passing Accrington\r\nBridge and crossing the Ermine Street, eventually falls into the Cam.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the remaining rivers of the county belong to the Thames\r\ncatchment-area. With the exception of the Thame, to be mentioned\r\nimmediately in a separate paragraph, these form two main systems,\r\nnamely that of the Colne draining the western and that of the Lea the\r\nnorthern and eastern part of the county; the watershed between these\r\ntwo systems running in a north-westerly and south-easterly direction\r\nbetween St Albans and Hatfield, and thence to the north of Chipping\r\nBarnet.\r\n\r\nThe Thame is almost entirely a Buckinghamshire river, but it rises in\r\nour county and runs on the north side of the great watershed formed by\r\nthe continuation of the Chiltern Hills; this watershed constituting a\r\nbroad, nearly waterless belt separating the catchment-area of the upper\r\nThame from that of the Lea. The Thame itself springs from three heads\r\nin the parish of Tring; the first of these rising near the vicarage,\r\nthe second at a spot called Dundell, and the third in a spring known as\r\nBulbourne. The three become united at New Mill, whence, after passing\r\nthrough Puttenham, the Thame flows by Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire,\r\nand from there continues its course till it eventually joins the Thames\r\nnear the village of Dorchester, a considerable distance below Oxford.\r\n\r\nOf the tributaries of the Colne system, the most important is the Ver\r\n(or Verlume), which rises some distance to the east of Cheverell’s\r\nGreen, on the Watling Street, and passes through the village of\r\nFlamstead, and thence near the line of the high road to Redbourn,\r\nwhere it is joined by an intermittent stream, or “bourne,” known as\r\nthe Wenmer, or Womer. The latter crosses the road from Harpenden to\r\nRedbourn at the foot of a steep descent; and in the old days its\r\nappearance as a running stream was believed to forbode a death, or\r\n“some extremity of dangerous import.” From Redbourn the Ver continues\r\nits course by way of Shafford Mill, at which place it crosses the high\r\nroad, to St Albans, where it passes between the present city and\r\nthe ruined walls of ancient Verulam, to which latter it is generally\r\nbelieved to have given its name. Thence its course is continued\r\nthrough the old nunnery of Sopwell (of which it supplied the extensive\r\nfish-ponds), and from that point it flows through Park Street to join\r\nthe Colne near Colney Street; the latter stream giving the name to\r\nthe united rivers, although the Ver is considerably the larger of\r\nthe two constituents. The Colne itself rises in the neighbourhood of\r\nTittenhanger, between St Albans and Hatfield, and passes through London\r\nColney on its way to join the Ver. Near Watford the Colne receives an\r\nimportant tributary in the shape of the Gade, which issues from the\r\nchalk in the meadows of Great Gaddesden (to which and Gadebridge it\r\ngives the name), and after passing through Hemel Hempstead and Nash\r\nMills, is joined at Two Waters by the Bulbourne. The latter rises at\r\nTring very close to the Bulbourne source of the Thame (the watershed\r\nbeing here very narrow), and runs by way of the Frith, Dagnalls,\r\nAldbury Meads, Dudswell Bottom, and North Church to the north-east\r\nside of Berkhampstead, where its volume is increased by two important\r\nsprings, and thence to Two Waters. There is also an intermittent stream\r\nknown as the Hertfordshire Bourne, which, when running, flows into\r\nthe Bulbourne about halfway between Berkhampstead and Boxmoor. It is\r\nreported--and apparently correctly--to flow on the average once in\r\nevery seven years; the point from which it flows may be higher up or\r\nlower down in the valley according to the amount of water discharged.\r\n\r\nBelow Two Waters the Gade (as the united stream is now called) passes\r\nthrough Kings Langley, Hunton Bridge, and Cassiobury Park to join\r\nthe Colne between that park and Watford. After skirting the north\r\nside of Moor Park immediately below the last-named town, the Colne\r\nreceives the Chess (giving the name to Chesham, in Buckinghamshire),\r\nwhich passes through Sarratt in our own county. The Colne then reaches\r\nRickmansworth, where it forms the boundary between Buckinghamshire\r\nand Middlesex, and thence flowing by way of Uxbridge and Colnbrook,\r\ndischarges itself into the Thames above Staines, after a course of\r\nabout thirty-five miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Netting the Gade, Cassiobury Park]\r\n\r\nWe pass next to the basin of the Lea or Luy, the Logodunum or\r\nLogrodunum of the ancient Britons, and the largest river in the county.\r\nThe Lea itself takes origin in a marsh at Leagrave, or Luigrave, a\r\nlittle north of Luton (= Lea-town), in Bedfordshire, and after passing\r\nthrough Luton Hoo, in that county, where it is expanded into a large\r\nartificial lake, enters Hertfordshire at East Hyde, in the valley north\r\nof Harpenden, and flows thence by way of Wheathampstead and Brocket\r\n(where it again expands into another artificial lake) to Hatfield,\r\nwhence its course is continued by way of Essendon and the north side\r\nof Bayfordbury Park to Hertford. Just before entering the county town\r\nthe Lea receives the Mimram, or Marran, which rises in the parish of\r\nKings Walden, to the north-west of the Bury, and flows to the eastward\r\nof Kimpton Hoo, and thence by way of Codicote, Welwyn, Digswell (with\r\nadded supplies from local springs), Tewin Water, and Hertingfordbury\r\nto its junction with the Lea close to Hertford. In the upper part of\r\nits course the Mimram receives the small brook known as the Kime, from\r\nwhich Kimpton and Kimpton Hoo take their names.\r\n\r\nIn Hertford the Lea is divided into two channels, one of which runs\r\nthrough the eastern portion of the town to cross Great Hertham common,\r\nwhile the other, which is navigable, passes along the western side to\r\njoin its fellow at the aforesaid common.\r\n\r\nAt about one-third the distance between Hertford and Ware the Lea is\r\nlargely augmented by the waters of the Beane (Benefician) and the\r\nRib, which join close to their union with the main river. The Beane\r\nrises from a ditch in the parish of Ardeley (between Stevenage and\r\nBuntingford), and thence flows in a southward direction by way of\r\nWalkern, Aston, Frogmore, Watton, and Stapleford, passing on its way\r\nthrough Woodhall Park, at the entrance to which it is reinforced by\r\nseveral strong springs. Between Watton and Stapleford it also receives\r\na small brook flowing from Bragbury End.\r\n\r\nStarting in an easterly direction from Ardeley or Walkern, we shall\r\ncross the low watershed dividing the valley of the Beane from that of\r\nthe Rib; which latter takes its rise near Reed, and after crossing the\r\nErmine Street at the south end of Buntingford, flows by way of West\r\nMill and New Bridge to Braughing, where it is joined by the Quin, which\r\nissues from a spring at Barkway, and passing by Hormead and Quinbury\r\n(to which it lends its name), reaches Braughing Priory. Below Braughing\r\nthe Rib, as it is now called, flows by way of Hammels, Standon,\r\nBarwick, Thundridge, to cross the Ermine Street at Wade’s Mill, and\r\nthence _viâ_ Ware Westmill and Ware Park to join the Lea with the Beane.\r\n\r\nFrom Luton to Hatfield the course of the Lea pursues a generally\r\nsouth-easterly direction; at Hatfield it becomes for a short distance\r\ndue east, and then trends to the north-east through Hertford to Ware.\r\nHere it takes a sudden bend, so that the remainder of its course\r\nthrough the county and the adjacent portion of Essex is almost due\r\nsouth. A direct line from Luton to the Lea near Waltham Abbey measures\r\nabout 40 miles; but, owing to its great north-easterly bend, the course\r\nof the Lea between these two points is something like 45 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bishop’s Stortford (showing the Plain Country)]\r\n\r\nThe last two rivers on our list are the Ash and the Stort, both of\r\nwhich in the upper part of their courses run from north to south\r\nnearly parallel with the Beane and the Quin. The Ash rises near Brent\r\nPelham and thence flowing by Much Hadham and through the parish\r\nof Widford, falls into the Lea above Stanstead Abbots. The Stort,\r\nwhich is the most easterly tributary of the Lea in the county, is\r\nof Essex origin, taking its rise at the very border of the county,\r\nnear Meesdon, and entering it again close to Bishop’s Stortford. Some\r\ndistance above Stortford it receives one tributary from the Essex and\r\na second from the Hertfordshire side, the latter forming for a short\r\ndistance the boundary between the two counties. At Stortford the\r\nStort is wholly within Hertfordshire, but a little below the town it\r\nforms the county boundary for a considerable distance, passing by\r\nway of Sawbridgeworth on the Hertfordshire, and Harlow on the Essex\r\nside, to join the Lea a short distance below the Rye House. From this\r\npoint and Hoddesdon nearly to Waltham Abbey the Lea forms the boundary\r\nbetween Hertfordshire and Essex, finally leaving the former county\r\nnear Waltham. The river now constitutes the line of division between\r\nMiddlesex and Essex, finally joining the Thames below Bow Bridge, at\r\nBarking, after a course of 45 miles.\r\n\r\nHere may conveniently be mentioned the celebrated Chadwell spring, near\r\nHertford, which after supplying London with a large amount of water\r\nby way of the New River (of which more in a later chapter) for three\r\nhundred years, failed temporarily in 1897, so that water began to flow\r\ninto, instead of out of its basin. Previous to this failure the amount\r\nof water discharged daily by the Chadwell spring was estimated at not\r\nless than 2,600,000 gallons. In addition to the temporary failure of\r\nChadwell, a spring in Woolmers Park, near Hertford, has of late years\r\ncompletely dried up; both these failures being attributed mainly, if\r\nnot entirely, to the tapping of the Hertfordshire water-supply by the\r\ndeep borings in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Geology and Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Geology we mean the study of the rocks, and we must at the outset\r\nexplain that the term _rock_ is used by the geologist without any\r\nreference to the hardness or compactness of the material to which the\r\nname is applied; thus he speaks of loose sand as a rock equally with a\r\nhard substance like granite.\r\n\r\nRocks are of two kinds, (1) those laid down mostly under water, (2)\r\nthose due to the action of fire.\r\n\r\nThe first kind may be compared to sheets of paper one over the other.\r\nThese sheets are called _beds_, and such beds are usually formed of\r\nsand (often containing pebbles), mud or clay, and limestone or mixtures\r\nof these materials. They are laid down as flat or nearly flat sheets,\r\nbut may afterwards be tilted as the result of movement of the earth’s\r\ncrust, just as you may tilt sheets of paper, folding them into arches\r\nand troughs, by pressing them at either end. Again, we may find the\r\ntops of the folds so produced worn away as the result of the wearing\r\naction of rivers, glaciers, and sea-waves upon them, as you might cut\r\noff the tops of the folds of the paper with a pair of shears. This has\r\nhappened with the ancient beds forming parts of the earth’s crust, and\r\nwe therefore often find them tilted, with the upper parts removed.\r\n\r\nThe other kinds of rocks are known as igneous rocks, which have been\r\nmolten under the action of heat and become solid on cooling. When in\r\nthe molten state they have been poured out at the surface as the lava\r\nof volcanoes, or have been forced into other rocks and cooled in the\r\ncracks and other places of weakness. Much material is also thrown out\r\nof volcanoes as volcanic ash and dust, and is piled up on the sides of\r\nthe volcano. Such ashy material may be arranged in beds, so that it\r\npartakes to some extent of the qualities of the two great rock groups.\r\n\r\nThe relations of such beds are of great importance to geologists, for\r\nby means of these beds we can classify the rocks according to age. If\r\nwe take two sheets of paper, and lay one on the top of the other on a\r\ntable, the upper one has been laid down after the other. Similarly with\r\ntwo beds, the upper is also the newer, and the newer will remain on the\r\ntop after earth-movements, save in very exceptional cases which need\r\nnot be regarded here, and for general purposes we may look upon any bed\r\nor set of beds resting on any other in our own country as being the\r\nnewer bed or set.\r\n\r\nThe movements which affect beds may occur at different times. One set\r\nof beds may be laid down flat, then thrown into folds by movement, the\r\ntops of the beds worn off, and another set of beds laid down upon the\r\nworn surface of the older beds, the edges of which will abut against\r\nthe oldest of the new set of flatly deposited beds, which latter may in\r\nturn undergo disturbance and renewal of their upper portions.\r\n\r\nAgain, after the formation of the beds many changes may occur in them.\r\nThey may become hardened, pebble-beds being changed into conglomerates,\r\nsands into sandstones, muds and clays into mudstones and shales,\r\nsoft deposits of lime into limestone, and loose volcanic ashes into\r\nexceedingly hard rocks. They may also become cracked, and the cracks\r\nare often very regular, running in two directions at right angles one\r\nto the other. Such cracks are known as _joints_, and the joints are\r\nvery important in affecting the physical geography of a district. Then,\r\nas the result of great pressure applied sideways, the rocks may be so\r\nchanged that they can be split into thin slabs, which usually, though\r\nnot necessarily, split along planes standing at high angles to the\r\nhorizontal. Rocks affected in this way are known as _slates_.\r\n\r\n              NAMES OF SYSTEMS              CHARACTERS OF ROCKS\r\n\r\n          { Recent & Pleistocene+------+\r\n          { Pliocene            +------+ sands, superficial deposits\r\n TERTIARY { Eocene              +------+\r\n          {                     |      | clays and sands chiefly\r\n                                +------+\r\n          { Cretaceous          |      | chalk at top\r\n          {                     |      | sandstones, mud and clays below\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n SECONDARY{ Jurassic            |      | shales, sandstones and\r\n          {                     |      | oolitic limestones\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n          { Triassic            |      | red sandstones and marls,\r\n          {                     |      |   gypsum and salt\r\n                                +------+\r\n          { Permian             |      | red sandstones & magnesian\r\n          {                     +------+  limestone\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     |      | sandstones, shales and coals\r\n          { Carboniferous       |      |  at top\r\n          {                     |      | sandstones in middle\r\n          {                     |      | limestone and shales below\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          { Devonian            |      | red sandstones,\r\n          {                     |      | shales, slates and limestones\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          { Silurian            |      | sandstones and shales\r\n          {                     |      | thin limestones\r\n PRIMARY  {                     +------+\r\n          {                     |      | shales, slates,\r\n          { Ordovician          |      | sandstones and\r\n          {                     |      | thin limestones\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          { Cambrian            |      | slates and\r\n          {                     |      | sandstones\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     |      |\r\n          {                     |      | sandstones,\r\n          { Pre-Cambrian        |      | slates and\r\n          {                     |      | volcanic rocks\r\n          {                     +------+\r\n\r\nIf we could flatten out all the beds of England, and arrange them one\r\nover the other and bore a shaft through them, we should see them on\r\nthe sides of the shaft, the newest appearing at the top and the oldest\r\nat the bottom, as shown in the figure. Such a shaft would have a depth\r\nof between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. The strata are divided into three\r\ngreat groups called Primary or Palaeozoic, Secondary or Mesozoic, and\r\nTertiary or Cainozoic, and the lowest of the Primary rocks are the\r\noldest rocks of Britain, which form as it were the foundation stones on\r\nwhich the other rocks rest. These may be spoken of as the Pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks. The three great groups are divided into minor divisions known\r\nas systems. The names of these systems are arranged in order in the\r\ntable with a very rough indication of their relative importance, though\r\nthe divisions above the Eocene have their thickness exaggerated, as\r\notherwise they would hardly show in the figure. On the right hand side,\r\nthe general characters of the rocks of each system are stated.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary remarks we may now proceed to a brief account of\r\nthe geology of the county.\r\n\r\nIn Hertfordshire, apart from the soil and the superficial accumulations\r\nof gravel, sand, and clay, only the lower beds or strata of the\r\nTertiary and the uppermost formations of the Secondary period are\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nAs the greater portion of the subjacent rocks of the county is formed\r\nby the Chalk, it will be convenient to commence with this formation.\r\nThe Chalk extends, or “strikes,” across all but the south-eastern\r\nportion of the county in a broad belt, with a general south-westerly\r\nor north-easterly direction, reaching on the northern side, with a\r\nfew exceptions, to the border of the county and beyond, while to the\r\nsouthward its boundary runs approximately through Bushey, South Mims,\r\nHertford, and Bishop’s Stortford. At Dunstable the Chalk forms what is\r\ncalled an “escarpment,” that is to say a high and somewhat precipitous\r\n(although rounded) cliff overlooking the great plain formed by the\r\nmarls and clays of the underlying strata. As in all true escarpments,\r\nthe beds, or strata of the Chalk, which are somewhat tilted by\r\nearth-movements out of their originally horizontal plane, incline, or\r\n“dip” away from the main face of the cliff, that is to say, towards the\r\nsouth-east; and this south-easterly dip of the Chalk, apart from local\r\ninterruptions and folds, continues to its southerly boundary. Now since\r\nthe Chalk is a porous formation admirably fitted to collect and retain\r\nthe rain-water falling upon it, while it is underlain, as we shall see\r\nshortly, by the impervious Gault Clay of the Bedfordshire plain, and\r\noverlain along its southern boundary by the equally impervious London\r\nClay, it is obvious that it will hold all the water thus collected,\r\nand that this water will tend to run deep down in the rock in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction. Hence the northern part of the Chalk zone\r\nforms an almost perfect water-collecting area, which can be tapped\r\nalong the southern side of the county by boring through the overlying\r\nLondon Clay.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk comprises several main divisions, of which the highest is\r\nknown as the Upper Chalk, or the Chalk with flints; this when fully\r\ndeveloped being about 300 feet thick. It is a soft white limestone\r\ntraversed by nearly horizontal layers of black, white-coated flint,\r\nwhich have originated by a process of “segregation” in the rock\r\nsubsequent to its deposition as ooze on the old sea-bed. Usually these\r\nlayers consist of irregular nodular masses; but there is sometimes a\r\ncontinuous thin layer of scarcely more than half-an-inch in thickness,\r\nlocally known as “chimney-flint.” The south-easterly dip of the Chalk\r\nis shown by the layers of flint to be not more, as a rule, than three\r\nor four degrees. The Upper Chalk extends from the summits of the\r\nhills as far down as Rickmansworth, Watford, Hatfield, and Hertford,\r\nthus forming the bed-rock of the greater portion of the county. By\r\nthe wearing away of the overlying Tertiary strata, a small cone, or\r\n“inlier,” of Chalk is exposed at Northaw.\r\n\r\nNext comes a bed of about four feet thick known as the Chalk-rock.\r\nIt is a hard cream-coloured rock, containing layers of green-coated\r\nnodules, is traversed by numerous vertical joints, and rings to the\r\nstroke of the hammer. Owing to its hardness, it resists the action of\r\nthe weather, and is therefore in evidence at or near the summits of\r\nthe hills, where it can be traced from close to Berkhampstead Castle\r\nby Boxmoor and Apsley, and thence to the south-west of Dunstable,\r\nKensworth, the south of Baldock, and so in a north-easterly direction\r\nto Lannock Farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View on the Downs looking towards Wallington from the\r\nIcknield Way]\r\n\r\nBelow the Chalk-rock we come to the Middle Chalk, or Chalk without\r\nflints, which may be so much as 350 feet in thickness, and rises in\r\na rather steep slope or “step” from the underlying beds to be next\r\nmentioned. Flints are few and far between in the Middle Chalk, which\r\nforms the western slope of the Downs at Royston, as well as beyond\r\nthe limits of the county at Luton, and so on to the Chiltern Hills.\r\nFossils are much more numerous in the Middle than in the Upper Chalk.\r\nThe lowest bed of the former is the Melbourn Rock, a hard, nodular\r\nband about 10 feet thick. Next comes the grey and white Lower Chalk,\r\nfrom 65 to 90 feet thick, after which we reach the Totternhoe Stone.\r\nAlthough only six feet in thickness, this Totternhoe Stone, which\r\nforms the escarpment of Royston Downs, is of importance as having been\r\nlargely employed in the construction of churches and other buildings on\r\nthe northern side of the county. It is a sandy grey limestone, which\r\nused to be largely quarried at Totternhoe, with special precautions\r\nin drying. It can be traced from Tring by way of Miswell, Marsworth,\r\nPirton, and Radwell to Ashwell.\r\n\r\nThe Totternhoe Stone really forms the top of the Chalk-marl, which is\r\nsome 80 feet thick, and consists of buff crumbling marly limestones. It\r\nforms a strip of low ground at the base of the Chalk escarpment. At the\r\nbottom of the Chalk occurs the so-called coprolite-bed, which contains\r\nlarge quantities of phosphate nodules. Forty years ago these beds were\r\nextensively worked between Hitchin and Cambridge for the sake of the\r\nnodules.\r\n\r\nOnly on the northern border of the county, between Hitchin and Baldock,\r\nand also near Tring and then merely to a very small extent, are any\r\nof the beds underlying the Chalk exposed. These comprise, firstly the\r\nUpper Greensand, which is either a sandy marl or a sandstone with green\r\ngrains, and secondly, a dark blue impervious clay known as the Gault.\r\nThese formations constitute the plain at the foot of the Chalk hills\r\nin Bedfordshire, the scenery of which is very similar to that of the\r\nLondon Clay plain in eastern Hertfordshire and Middlesex.\r\n\r\nIt is important to add that, at a gradually increasing depth as we\r\nproceed south, the Gault underlies the whole of the Hertfordshire\r\nChalk, and renders the latter such an excellent water-bearing\r\nformation. If the Gault be perforated we come upon the Lower Greensand,\r\nanother excellent water-bearing stratum, which comes to the surface in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Silsoe, in Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to the formations overlying the Chalk in the southern\r\nhalf of the county. Here it should be mentioned that all the formations\r\nhitherto described overlie (or underlie) one another in what is termed\r\nconformable sequence; that is to say, there is no break between them,\r\nbut a more or less nearly complete passage from one to another. Between\r\nthe Chalk and the overlying Tertiary formations, there is, on the other\r\nhand, a great break or “unconformity”; the surface of the Chalk having\r\nbeen worn into a very irregular contour, above which we pass suddenly\r\nto the Tertiary beds, generally containing at their base a number of\r\nrolled chalk flints. This indicates that before the Tertiary beds were\r\nlaid down, the Chalk had become dry land; after which a portion of it\r\nonce more subsided beneath the ocean. The Tertiary beds are in fact\r\nformed for the most part from the _débris_, or wearing away of the old\r\nChalk land.\r\n\r\nThe lowest Tertiary stratum of eastern and southern Hertfordshire is\r\nknown as the Woolwich and Reading beds. These consist of alternations\r\nof bright-coloured plastic clays and sandy or pebble-beds; their\r\nmaximum thickness in the county being about 35 feet. They form a band\r\nextending from Harefield Park to Watford, and thence to Hatfield and\r\nHertford. Below the Woolwich and Reading beds we come on the London\r\nClay, of which the basement bed contains a layer of flint pebbles,\r\nalthough the remainder of this thick formation is a stiff blue clay,\r\nturning brown when exposed to the action of the weather. Originally\r\nthese Tertiary formations must have extended all over the Chalk of\r\ncentral Hertfordshire, as is demonstrated by the occurrence of patches,\r\nor “outliers,” of them over a zone of considerable width. Such Tertiary\r\noutliers occur at Micklefield Hall, Micklefield Green, Sarratt, Abbot’s\r\nLangley, Bedmond, Bennet’s End, and Leverstock Green, and in the\r\nnorthern, or St Peter’s portion of St Albans.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with these Tertiary formations is the well-known\r\nHertfordshire pudding-stone; a conglomerate formed of stained\r\nflint-pebbles cemented together by a flinty matrix as hard as the\r\npebbles themselves, so that a fracture forms a clean surface traversing\r\nboth pebbles and cement. This pudding-stone is usually found in\r\nthe gravels (or washed out of them) in irregular masses, weighing\r\nfrom a few pounds to as many tons. It is stated, however, to occur\r\nin its original bedding between Aldenham and Shenley; and the rock\r\nevidently represents a hardened zone of the Woolwich and Reading beds.\r\nPudding-stone is found in special abundance at St Albans and again in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Great Gaddesden. In some St Albans specimens the\r\npebbles are stained black for a considerable thickness by the oxides of\r\niron, while the central core is bright red or orange. Such specimens,\r\nwhen cut and polished, form ornamental stones of great beauty; but, on\r\naccount of their hardness, the expense of cutting is very heavy.\r\n\r\nExcept on the higher part of the Chalk Downs, and very generally along\r\na narrow band half way up the sides of the valleys, the aforesaid\r\nformations are but rarely exposed in the county at the surface, on\r\naccount of being overlaid with superficial deposits of gravel, clay,\r\netc., which are of post-Tertiary age, and were deposited for the most\r\npart during the time that man has been an inhabitant of the world.\r\nThese superficial beds are very frequently termed “drift,” on account\r\nof a large portion being formed by ice, at the time that northern\r\nEurope was under the influence of the great glacial period. Over most\r\nof the chalk area the denuded surface of the Chalk is covered with a\r\nthick layer of stiff clay full of flints, this layer being formed by\r\nthe disintegration of the Chalk itself, the soluble calcareous portion\r\nbeing dissolved and carried away, while the insoluble flints and clay\r\nremain. Above this layer in the neighbourhood of Hertford, Barnet, and\r\nelsewhere, is a series of gravelly beds assigned to the middle division\r\nof the glacial period; while these in turn are overlaid locally,\r\nas at Bricket Wood, between St Albans and Watford, by the chalky\r\nBoulder-clay, of upper glacial age, which is there some twenty feet\r\nin thickness. In other places, as at Harpenden, the hills are capped\r\nby a still greater thickness of clayey deposits, mingled with flints,\r\nresting upon a very irregular surface of Chalk, which appears to be\r\nfor the most part of glacial origin. Speaking generally, Boulder-clay\r\nis characteristic of the east, and clay with flints and gravel of the\r\nwestern side of the county.\r\n\r\nHalf way down the sides of the hills, in the district last named, the\r\nChalk is more or less completely exposed at the surface along a narrow\r\nzone, below which we come upon deposits of gravel, sand, and clay\r\nfilling the bottoms of the valleys. At Bowling Alley, Harpenden, these\r\ndeposits are fully forty feet in thickness. Although they have been\r\nsupposed to be the result of river action, it is more probable that\r\nthey are due to rain-wash. Indeed this is practically proved in the\r\ncase of the valley leading from Harpenden towards No-Man’s-Land, where\r\nthe lower end is blocked by a ridge of gravel, which could not possibly\r\nhave been formed by river action. The stones in these valley-gravels\r\nare of irregular shape, and thus quite different from the rounded\r\npebbles of the gravels of the Woolwich and Reading beds, as seen at St\r\nPeter’s, St Albans. At Harpenden the uppermost layer of valley-gravel\r\nis extremely clean and sharp, generally of a golden yellow colour with\r\nblackish veins. Deposits of brick-earth occur locally throughout the\r\nChalk area.\r\n\r\nOver the greater part of the county the soil is the result of the\r\ndecomposition of the foregoing superficial formations; and is\r\nconsequently in most cases of a stiffer and more clayey character on\r\nthe hill-tops than in the valleys, where it frequently forms only a\r\nbed of a foot, or even less, in thickness above the sharp, running\r\ngravel. Everywhere in the Chalk districts the soil contains a vast\r\nnumber of flints; but it is, nevertheless, admirably adapted for\r\ncorn-growing, and especially for malting-grain; Hertford being one of\r\nthe four English counties best suited to crops of the latter nature.\r\nOn many of the unenclosed commons the soil is, however, of a poor and\r\nhungry nature, producing various kinds of inferior grass, together\r\nwith spring-flowering gorse, as on Harpenden Common, or heather, as\r\nat Kingsbourn Green, between Harpenden and Luton, and at Gustard\r\nWood, near Wheathampstead. On the higher Chalk Downs near Dunstable\r\nand Royston there is little or no soil properly so-called; the short,\r\nbut sweet and nourishing grass growing on the chalk itself. A very\r\ndifferent type of soil obtains in the London Clay area in the south and\r\neast of the county; this being heavy and clayey, and thus better suited\r\nfor grass than for corn; in fact in the old days the Middlesex portion\r\nof this district was known to the country people as the “Hay-country.”\r\nAlong many of the river-valleys peaty soils of a marshy and swampy\r\nnature prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former days, when the mammoth or hairy elephant, the extinct woolly\r\nrhinoceros, and the wild ox, together with the African hippopotamus\r\nand spotted hyaena roamed over the Thames valley and afforded sport to\r\nour prehistoric ancestors, England was joined to the Continent across\r\nwhat is now the English Channel; so that the animals and plants of\r\nthe southern portion of our islands, at any rate, were more or less\r\nnearly identical with those of France and Belgium. The advent of the\r\ngreat ice age, or glacial period, caused, however, a vast disturbance\r\nof the fauna and flora (as the assemblages of animals and plants\r\ncharacteristic of different countries are respectively termed),\r\nespecially as about this time there occurred several oscillations in\r\nthe level of our country, during one or more of which Great Britain\r\nwas temporarily separated from the Continent. How much or how little\r\nthese and other changes had to do with the poverty of the British fauna\r\nas compared with that of the Continent is too long and difficult a\r\nquestion to be discussed in this place; but certain it is that even\r\nthe southern counties of England do possess fewer species of animals\r\nand plants than France or Belgium; that this poverty increases with\r\nthe distance from the Continent; and that Ireland is much poorer in\r\nspecies than England. It may perhaps be well to add, although it does\r\nnot really concern our subject, that there appears to have been another\r\nland-connection by means of which Scotland and Ireland received a\r\nportion of their faunas from Scandinavia by way of what is now the\r\nNorth Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Six Hills, Stevenage (Danish Barrows)]\r\n\r\nAt the date of the final insulation of Great Britain from the Continent\r\nthere is every reason to believe that all the land animals of the\r\nformer were identical with species inhabiting adjacent regions of the\r\nlatter. And even at the present day, when isolation has for centuries\r\nbeen exerting its influence on the non-migratory (and in some degree\r\nalso on the migratory) animals, there are no species of quadrupeds\r\n(mammals), birds, or reptiles absolutely peculiar to our islands, with\r\nthe exception of the grouse; and in the opinion of many naturalists\r\nthat bird should be regarded rather as a local variety or race of the\r\nwillow-grouse of Scandinavia than as a distinct species.\r\n\r\nMinor variations, however, characterise many, if not indeed all, of our\r\nBritish quadrupeds and birds when contrasted with their continental\r\nrepresentatives. The British squirrel is, for instance, very markedly\r\ndistinct from all the continental races of that animal in the matter\r\nof colouring, while somewhat less decided differences characterise our\r\nbadger, hare, field-mice, etc. Similarly, among birds, the British\r\ncoal-tit is so decidedly distinct from its continental representatives\r\nthat it is regarded by some naturalists as entitled to rank as a\r\nspecies by itself; and minor differences from their continental cousins\r\nare displayed by the British redbreast, bullfinch, great titmouse,\r\nand many other resident species. Indeed, if careful comparisons were\r\ninstituted between sufficiently large series of specimens, it is almost\r\ncertain that all species of resident British land animals, as well as\r\nexclusively fresh-water fishes, would display certain differences from\r\ntheir foreign representatives; while in some instances, at any rate, as\r\nis already known to be the case in regard to certain species, more than\r\none local race of an animal may exist in our own islands.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a question as to what is to be gained by the\r\nrecognition of such comparatively trifling local differences in animals\r\n(and still more by assigning to them distinct technical names), as the\r\nsplitting process may be carried to an almost endless degree. A large\r\nLondon fishmonger is, for instance (as the writer is informed), able\r\nto distinguish a Tay from a Severn or Avon salmon; while a wholesale\r\ngame-dealer will in like manner discriminate between a Perthshire and a\r\nYorkshire grouse. In like manner a Hertfordshire badger or stoat may be\r\ndistinguished from their Midland or North of England representatives;\r\nbut it is difficult to see in what respect we should be the better for\r\nthe recognising of the existence of such differences.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the fauna and flora of Hertfordshire may be regarded for\r\nall practical purposes as more or less completely identical with that\r\nof the south-east of England generally; and nothing would be gained,\r\neven if space permitted, by giving lists of the species which have been\r\nfound within the limits of our county.\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of Hertfordshire, like those of other counties\r\nwith varying geological formations, are not, however, by any means\r\nthe same everywhere. On the contrary, there are well-marked local\r\ndifferences mainly associated with what naturalists call “station”;\r\nthat is to say, differences of elevation, soil, geological formation,\r\nclimate, etc., etc. The animals and plants of the high chalk downs\r\nin the neighbourhood of Gaddesden, Dunstable, and Ashwell, are for\r\ninstance more or less markedly distinct from those of the lower level\r\ncorn-growing areas of the centre of the county. On these elevated\r\ntracts we find, for example, wheatears, stone-curlews (near Tring),\r\nblue butterflies, burnet-moths, small brown-banded white snails,\r\na periwinkle-like snail with a horny door to its shell known as\r\nCyclostoma, blue gentians, certain orchids, and many other kinds of\r\nplants rarely or never seen on the low grounds. The open commons and\r\nheaths, on the other hand, as has been already mentioned, are the\r\nhome of heather and gorse, together with various distinctive birds\r\nand reptiles, such as stonechats, whinchats, titlarks, goldfinches,\r\nvipers, slow-worms, and lizards. In the river-bottoms and other\r\nswampy localities we find marsh and water-birds, such as yellow\r\nwagtails, snipes, sandpipers, grebes (at Tring), herons, moorhens,\r\nwater-rails, coots, dabchicks, and wild duck, together with (locally)\r\nthe common grass or water snake, amber-snails, marsh-marigolds, purple\r\nloose-strife, ragged robin, reeds, and yellow flags.\r\n\r\nBeech trees, as mentioned above, form the predominant timber on the\r\nchalk-lands other than the high downs, while on the heavier soils of\r\nthe centre of the county their place is mainly taken by elm and ash.\r\nOn these lowlands and other open cultivated tracts are found such\r\nbirds as partridges, corncrakes, lapwings, pipits, and larks; while\r\nin the coppices, hedgerows, and gardens we look for nightingales (from\r\nwhich bird Harpenden takes its name, _haerpen_ being a nightingale\r\nand _dene_ a valley in Anglo-Saxon), blackcaps, whitethroats, wrens,\r\nand nuthatches; while the woods are the resort of green and spotted\r\nwoodpeckers, wood-pigeons, jays, and pheasants. The low grass-growing\r\nclay-plains on the southern side of the county support, as already\r\nstated, an abundant growth of oaks to the almost complete exclusion\r\nof other timber trees; and this area doubtless also presents certain\r\npeculiarities in its fauna distinguishing it from the corn-growing\r\ntract to the north. The oaks grow to a very great size, especially at\r\nSacombe and Woodhall Park, and three notable specimens in the county\r\nare Queen Elizabeth’s oak at Hatfield, Goff’s oak at Cheshunt, and the\r\nPanshanger oak.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these local peculiarities in the fauna dependent upon\r\nelevation, geological formation, soil, and the presence or absence\r\nof forest, there are, however, certain others for which climate may\r\npossibly account.\r\n\r\nA case in point is afforded by the distribution of stag-beetles and\r\nmagpies in the county. Both these species are unknown in the district\r\nimmediately round Harpenden, while the former, at any rate, are\r\nlikewise unknown in the St Albans district, and apparently between that\r\ncity and London. If, however, we travel from Harpenden to the east,\r\nmagpies may be met with when we reach Codicote, while in the opposite\r\ndirection they occur in the Hemel Hempstead district. As to the exact\r\npoint where stag-beetles make their appearance in the latter direction\r\nthe writer has no information, but they are to be met with in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rickmansworth and elsewhere on the Buckinghamshire\r\nborder, and become quite common in that county. Grass-snakes, so\r\nfar as the writer is aware, are likewise absent from the Harpenden\r\nneighbourhood, although on the Cambridgeshire side of the county they\r\nare quite common, as they are across the border.\r\n\r\nIf the local distribution of these species were carefully worked out\r\nand mapped, we might perhaps be able to account for what is at present\r\na puzzle.\r\n\r\nWith the increase of population and building the wild fauna of\r\nHertfordshire, like that of England generally, has been gradually\r\nbecoming poorer in species--probably indeed from the time the mammoth\r\nand the woolly rhinoceros were exterminated, as they possibly were, by\r\nour prehistoric ancestors. When the wolf, the bear, the wild cat, and\r\nthe beaver disappeared, is quite unknown; but it is in comparatively\r\nmodern times that the marten has been exterminated, a solitary\r\nindividual of this species having been killed in the county within a\r\nscore of miles of London, that is to say near Watford, so recently as\r\nDecember, 1872. Polecats appear to have almost if not quite disappeared\r\nfrom the county, although a straggler may occasionally enter from\r\nBuckinghamshire, where a few still survive; and one was trapped in Ware\r\nPark about 1885. Otters are rare, although a few occasionally appear\r\nin the lower part of the Lea valley, and some may enter the county\r\nfrom Buckinghamshire, in parts of which they are much more common,\r\nthe Buckinghamshire Otter-hounds having killed over a score of these\r\nanimals in 1908. Some years ago badgers were to be found in many parts\r\nof the county, a well-known haunt previous to 1840 being “Badger’s\r\nDell” in Cassiobury Park. They still occur locally in certain parts of\r\nthe Buckinghamshire side of the county, and probably elsewhere. Foxes\r\nowe their preservation mainly to the sporting instincts of the county\r\ngentry and farmers.\r\n\r\nAmong birds that have disappeared from the county, the most to be\r\nregretted is the bustard, which in the early part of last century\r\nwas still to be found in the neighbourhood of Royston, although\r\nthe precise date of its extermination from this part of England is\r\nunknown. The bittern, too, is, at the very most, known only as an\r\noccasional straggler; but a specimen was shot in a small marshy pond on\r\nHarpenden Common some time previous to 1860. The Royston crow, by some\r\nnaturalists held to be only a form of the common crow, has been named\r\nfrom the Hertfordshire town, though a widespread species throughout\r\nmany parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nNeither has extermination been confined to animals. Fern-hunters\r\nhave in some instances made a clean sweep of certain species of\r\nferns from many districts, if not from the county generally; and\r\nnowadays aspleniums, shield-ferns, polypodies, and false maidenhair\r\n(_trichomanes_) have completely disappeared from the Harpenden high\r\nroads and lanes; the present writer possessing in his garden what he\r\nbelieves to be the sole remaining indigenous specimen of the last-named\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAmong localities specially celebrated for birds in the county are\r\nTring reservoirs, where vast flocks of water-birds congregate,\r\nespecially in winter. Here breeds the great crested grebe; and here,\r\ntoo, was shot in 1901 the only known British example of the white-eyed\r\npochard. The neighbouring downs, as already mentioned, form one of the\r\nchief English resorts of the stone-curlew, or thick-knee; a species of\r\nespecial interest on account of the remarkable manner in which both\r\nbirds and eggs assimilate to their surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tring Park]\r\n\r\nRare birds, as well as various maritime species driven from their\r\nnormal resorts by stress of weather, make their appearance occasionally\r\nin various parts of the county, but references to very few of such\r\ncases must suffice. During the great visitation of sand-grouse (a bird\r\nnormally characteristic of the steppes of Central Asia) to the British\r\nIsles in 1863, some individuals reached this county. In the early part\r\nof last century a little auk, or rotche, was taken on the millhead at\r\nWheathampstead during very severe weather; a great northern diver has\r\nbeen seen on Tring reservoir; a pair of storm petrels were killed some\r\nfive-and-twenty years ago at Hemel Hempstead, where snow-buntings have\r\nlikewise been seen; while various species of gulls from time to time\r\nput in an appearance in winter. Among recent events of this nature the\r\nappearance at Harpenden of an immature specimen of the great purple\r\nheron is certainly noteworthy. In 1878 the late Mr J. E. Littleboy had\r\nrecorded 201 species of birds from the county, and a few others have\r\nbeen added since, bringing up the number to 210 in 1902.\r\n\r\nIn regard to fishes, it is of interest to quote the following passage\r\nfrom Sir Henry Chauncy’s _Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire_,\r\npublished early in the eighteenth century. After referring to its other\r\nfish, it is there stated, in the author’s quaint language, that the\r\nriver Lea also contains “some Salmons; which (like young Deer) have\r\nseveral denominations: the first Year they are called Salmon-smelts,\r\nthe second Year Salmon-sprats, the third Year Salmon-forktails, the\r\nfourth Year Salmon-peall, the fifth Year Salmonets, and the sixth Year\r\nSalmon; and if these Fish had free Passage by the Mills, and thro’ the\r\nSluices at Waltham up the Stream towards Ware and Hertford, where they\r\nmight Spawn in fresh Water and were carefully preserved from Pochers,\r\nthey would greatly increase in that River, and be of great benefit,\r\nas well to the City of London as the Country; for some Water-men have\r\nobserved, that they delight in this Stream, and play much about those\r\nSluices at Waltham.”\r\n\r\nChauncy likewise mentions that trout from the Lea below Hertford, where\r\nit has peaty banks, are much less red than those from the gravelly\r\nstreams of the chalk districts.\r\n\r\nFor botanical purposes the county has been divided into six districts\r\ncorresponding to the river-basins; the first two belonging to the Ouse\r\nsystem, and comprising the Cam and the Ivel basins, and the other four,\r\ncomprising the Thame, the Colne, the Brent, and the Lea, pertaining\r\nto the Thames system. Of these the Lea area is the largest, the Colne\r\nnext in size, the Ivel considerably smaller, and the other three quite\r\nsmall. In some respects the local characters of the flora are, however,\r\nbetter brought out by taking the geological formations as a basis of\r\ndivision. The Upper Chalk area, capped with much Boulder-clay on the\r\neastern, and with clay-and-flints and gravel on the western side,\r\ncorresponds very closely as regards these divisions with the Lea and\r\nthe Colne basins. The Middle Chalk, which as we have seen is exposed on\r\nthe flanks of the continuation of the Chiltern Hills in the north-west,\r\nis peculiar in being the only area in the county in which grows the\r\npasque-flower, or anemone; this chiefly flourishing on south-westerly\r\nslopes, as at Aldbury Towers, near Tring. The Middle Chalk is also the\r\nchief home of the various kinds of orchis; the dwarf, the man, and the\r\nbutterfly orchis being apparently restricted to this formation. The\r\nTertiary area has a vegetation of a totally different type from the\r\nso-called “dry-plant type” characteristic of the Chalk area, but it\r\ncannot be further mentioned here.\r\n\r\nIn the five adjacent counties there occur 110 species of flowering\r\nplants unknown in Hertfordshire. On the other hand, Hertfordshire has\r\nabout a dozen plants (exclusive of varieties of the bramble) unknown\r\nin the adjacent counties. Of the 893 native flowering plants of\r\nHertfordshire about 110 have not been recorded from Cambridgeshire,\r\nwhile about 120 are wanting in Bedfordshire, 170 in Buckinghamshire,\r\n140 in Middlesex, and 100 in Essex. These figures may, however, be\r\nsubject to considerable modification by future research. The following\r\npassage on the relations of the Hertfordshire flora is quoted from the\r\n_Victoria History of the Counties of England_:--\r\n\r\n“Taking the number of species in any adjoining county which are absent\r\nfrom Hertfordshire as the best index of the degree of relationship,\r\nit would appear that the flora of Bucks is the most nearly allied to\r\nthat of Herts, and that those of Cambridge and Essex are the most\r\ndivergent.... This is just what might be expected from the physical\r\nfeatures and geological structure of these counties. The floras of\r\nCambridge and Essex have also a more northern or north-eastern facies\r\n[character] than that of Hertfordshire, which is of a decidedly\r\nsouthern type. The large number of Hertfordshire species which have not\r\nyet been recorded from Buckinghamshire is probably due to the flora\r\nof that county not having been so thoroughly investigated as ours has\r\nbeen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Climate and Rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its original sense the word climate meant the degree of inclination\r\nof the sun’s rays at any particular spot at a specified date; but\r\nnowadays it is employed to designate the average type of weather\r\nexperienced in a district. In this latter sense it comprises the\r\nresults of the combined effects of temperature, atmospheric pressure,\r\nthe degree of moisture in the air, the direction and force of the\r\nwind, and the amount of rainfall; the study of climate constituting\r\nthe science of meteorology. Although the climate of the British Isles\r\nis of an exceedingly changeable type, yet the average of the seasonal\r\nchanges is far from being the same in all parts of the country. Taking\r\ntemperature alone, we find, for instance, that while the average for\r\nthe whole year in Shetland is as low as 43° Fahrenheit, in the Scilly\r\nIslands it rises to 53°. It is a very general idea that in our islands\r\nthe winter temperature of a place depends upon whether it is situated\r\nin the north or the south. This, however, is a mistake, the temperature\r\nhaving little relation to latitude, but growing colder as we pass from\r\nthe west to the eastern side of the country; the south of England, as\r\na whole, being milder than the north, not because it is the south,\r\nbut because it includes such a large extent of land in the west. The\r\ndegree of elevation above the sea-level has much to do with temperature\r\nand the amount of moisture in the air; high lands being, as a rule,\r\ncolder and drier in winter than those lying at lower levels. On account\r\nof the comparatively high elevation of a considerable proportion of\r\nits area and its easterly position, coupled with the prevalence of\r\nnorth-easterly and easterly winds in spring, Hertfordshire ought to\r\nhave, on the whole, a cold and bracing climate for the greater part of\r\nthe year; and, as a matter of fact, such is the case. Indeed, it is\r\ncommonly said that northern Hertfordshire is so cold and bracing, that\r\nonly strong and robust constitutions can stand it; but that for those\r\nblessed with such constitutions it is one of the healthiest counties in\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nHertfordshire, however, like England on a small scale, has local\r\nclimates of its own, dependent upon differences in elevation above the\r\nsea-level, in the amount of rainfall, in the nature of the geological\r\nformation and soil, and also in aspect, especially as regards\r\nprotection from the east wind in spring. The slope of a hill facing\r\nsouth or south-west receives for instance far more sun in winter than\r\none which looks in the opposite direction; while it also escapes the\r\nfull blast of the bitter east wind. Places situated on chalk, and above\r\nall on gravel, are drier, and consequently--if on the same level and\r\nwith a similar aspect--also warmer than those on cold, heavy clay or\r\nmarl.\r\n\r\nAs if to confirm and perpetuate the above-mentioned popular error, it\r\nhappens that the northern and north-western districts of the county,\r\nthat is to say, those constituting the chalk area, are very much colder\r\nand more bracing than those to the south and east, whose substratum\r\nis clay. This difference depends, however, not on differences of\r\nlatitude, but on the lower elevation of the southern as compared with\r\nthe northern districts, coupled with the protection from cold winds\r\nafforded to the low lands by the high ground. To those who are in the\r\nhabit of travelling by the Midland railway from the north-western\r\ncorner of the county to London, the differences between the climate\r\nof the northern and the southern districts is made self-apparent in\r\nearly spring by the extraordinary difference in the condition of the\r\nhedges and trees on the two sides of the Elstree tunnel. It is true\r\nthat on this particular route the district south of the tunnel is in\r\nMiddlesex, but to the eastward much of the lowland is in Herts. On the\r\nnorthern side of the range of chalk-hills pierced by this tunnel the\r\nhawthorn hedges may be seen at a certain period of the spring to be\r\nabsolutely devoid of a sign of green; while on the opposite side they\r\nwill be in full leaf. There is, in fact, about a fortnight’s difference\r\nbetween the Elstree and the Mill Hill side of this range in regard to\r\nthe development of spring-vegetation; and while the northern side is\r\nexposed to the full force of the east wind, the combes and valleys with\r\na south-westerly aspect near the summit of the opposite flank are so\r\nwarm and sheltered that hardy species of bamboo and palm will grow in\r\nthe open air almost as luxuriantly as in similar situations in Surrey\r\nor Sussex.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, as has been well remarked, that the division of the\r\ncounty, along the line indicated in the section on its geology, into\r\ntwo very unequal portions--namely, a large north-western area with a\r\nrelatively dry soil and atmosphere, and a smaller south-eastern tract\r\nwith a comparatively moist soil and atmosphere--forms a sufficient\r\napproach to an accurate climatic division.\r\n\r\nHere we may mention that the daily temperature and the amount of\r\nmoisture in the air, together with the barometric pressure and a number\r\nof other details, are recorded at the Meteorological Office in London\r\nfrom reports received from a host of observing stations (either public\r\nor private) scattered at intervals all over the country; and at the end\r\nof each year the averages, or “means,” of these observations are worked\r\nout for the British Isles and England generally, and likewise for the\r\nvarious counties and other local districts. This enables comparisons\r\nto be instituted between the climates of different places with much\r\ngreater accuracy than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1905 the mean temperature for the whole of England\r\nwas 48·7°, while that of Hertfordshire was 48·9°, as deduced from\r\nobservations taken at four stations, of which Bennington showed\r\nthe lowest mean of 48·4°, and New Barnet the highest of 50·2°. The\r\naforesaid county mean of 48·9° was, however, 0·6° above the average;\r\nthe average mean for a series of years thus being 47·8°, or about 1°\r\nlower than that for England generally.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the map here given we notice that, speaking generally,\r\nthe rainfall of England decreases steadily as we pass from west to\r\neast. The moisture-laden clouds, driven by the prevalent winds across\r\nthe Atlantic, precipitate their contents on reaching the land, more\r\nespecially if the land be high, and in consequence the country beyond\r\nis less wet. Hertfordshire occupies a middle position between the heavy\r\naverages of Wales and S.W. England and the minimum of Essex and the\r\nneighbourhood of the Wash, as we should expect. The difference between\r\nthe average of the various stations in our country is remarkable. In\r\nthe year 1905, which is taken throughout as the basis of comparison,\r\nthe highest rainfall in England and Wales occurred at Glas Lyn, near\r\nSnowdon, and was no less than 176·6 inches; whereas the lowest was\r\nregistered at Shoeburyness, in Essex, this being only 14·57 inches;\r\nwhile the average rainfall for Great Britain was 27·17 inches. In\r\nHertfordshire, as we shall see, the average in that year for the whole\r\ncounty was 23·47 inches, but this is 1·5 inches below the general\r\naverage for a series of years, which is 24·52 inches. In the same year\r\nthe average for the four chief observing stations in the county was,\r\nhowever, 24·22 inches, with a maximum of 25·88 inches at New Barnet and\r\na minimum of 22·51 inches at Bennington. These extremes were exceeded\r\nby a maximum of 28·29 inches at Pendley Manor, Tring, and a minimum of\r\n19·31 inches (or rather more than 5 inches above the Essex minimum) at\r\nHillside, Buntingford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLAND & WALES\r\n\r\nANNUAL RAINFALL\r\n\r\n  GEORGE PHILIP & SON LTD.\r\n\r\n(_The figures show the annual rainfall in inches._)]\r\n\r\nFor a succession of years it has, however, been observed that the\r\nrainfall of Hertfordshire is in excess of that of all the adjacent\r\ncounties to the west and south. This is shown by the following\r\ncomparative average rainfalls for 1905; viz.: Bedfordshire (23\r\nstations), 20·47 ins.; Buckinghamshire (32 stations), 22·06 ins.;\r\nMiddlesex, exclusive of London (49 stations), 22·26 ins.; and\r\nHertfordshire (51 stations), 23·47 ins. Of the 104 stations exclusive\r\nof Hertfordshire, the combined mean rainfall is 21·6 inches;\r\nHertfordshire thus showing an excess over the average rainfall in the\r\nadjoining counties of nearly two inches in actual amount.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, and in spite of the excess over its neighbour in the\r\nmatter of rainfall, Hertford may be reckoned among the relatively dry\r\ncounties; its average in 1905 being nearly four inches below that for\r\nEngland generally in the same year.\r\n\r\nAt Bennington there were recorded 1523 hours of bright sunshine during\r\nthe year, and 54 absolutely sunless days. Throughout Great Britain as a\r\nwhole there were 186 days in the same year on which a minimum of 0·005\r\ninch of rain fell; all such days with that or a greater quantity of\r\nrain being officially known as rain-days. At Greenwich, where the total\r\namount of rainfall was 23·024 inches, the rain-days numbered 161, and\r\nthe wettest month was June when 4·323 inches of rain were registered.\r\nJune was also the wettest month of the year in Hertfordshire, but the\r\namount of rain was much less than at Greenwich, being only 3·46 inches.\r\n\r\nAs regards bright sunshine, the number of hours in England as a whole\r\namounted to 1535, while in Kent the number reached 1667·8, and at\r\nTunbridge Wells 1712·4 hours.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the number of wet days during the year in question\r\nHertfordshire therefore occupied a very creditable position, although\r\nits record for sunshine was less satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. People--Race, Dialect, Settlements, Population.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Roman occupation of Britain Hertfordshire was inhabited\r\nby two British tribes,--the Cattyeuchlani, whose capital appears to\r\nhave been Verulam or St Albans, and the Trinobantes. To what extent\r\nthese original British inhabitants of the county survived the Roman\r\nand Saxon invasions is unknown; but it may be taken as certain that at\r\nan early date Anglo-Saxon was the language spoken in this part of the\r\ncountry. Forty years ago Anglo-Saxon idioms and words still lingered\r\namong the labouring rural population in the Harpenden district (and\r\nprobably elsewhere), which have apparently now disappeared completely.\r\nInstead of _houses_, the Anglo-Saxon plural _housen_ was, for instance,\r\nalways used by the old people; while when a log of timber was cut the\r\nwrong way of the grain they would say that it would be sure to _spalt_\r\n(equivalent to the German _spalten_), instead of to split.\r\n\r\nOf the Anglo-Saxon language there were originally two chief dialects,\r\na northern and a southern; but after the Norman conquest the number\r\nof such dialects was increased to half-a-dozen. According to Dr A. J.\r\nEllis’s _English Dialects_, southern Hertfordshire comes within the\r\ndomain of the south-eastern dialect, which also prevailed in Middlesex,\r\nsouth-eastern Buckinghamshire, and south-western Essex. Throughout\r\nthis area there is, however, an underlying basis of the middle eastern\r\ndialect, which is still to be detected in northern Hertfordshire, as\r\nwell as in Essex, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, and Northamptonshire.\r\nIt accordingly appears that if the East Anglian counties of\r\nCambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk be eliminated, the whole of the\r\ncountry lying to the eastward of the Chiltern Hills, as well as the\r\nhigh grounds of Northamptonshire, had one dialect in common, which was\r\nthe speech of the early Teuton settlers of this part of England. This\r\ndialect, during the course of fourteen centuries, has been gradually\r\nmodified and altered by the speech of London till it has resulted in\r\nthe modern English of this part of south-eastern England.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr R. A. Smith, writing in the _Victoria History of\r\nthe Counties of England_, “The grouping of dialects in this part\r\nof the country would thus unite Hertfordshire with Essex, and lead\r\nus to expect from archæology some indications of Saxon rather\r\nthan of Anglian influence in the county. The few results already\r\nobtained in Hertfordshire certainly show a marked absence of Anglian\r\ncharacteristics, but many discoveries must be made before the\r\npeculiarities of East Saxon remains can be demonstrated. To the west\r\nof the Chilterns enough has been recovered from graves to show that\r\nthe settlers in the upper Thames valley, presumably the Saxons of the\r\nWest, were homogeneous [uniform in characteristics] and distinguishable\r\nfrom their neighbours; but at present nothing has been found to link\r\nthem with the people of Essex, who probably reached the eastern slopes\r\nof the Chilterns at one time, but were mainly confined to the north of\r\nEssex and the neighbourhood of London. In fact, the few discoveries in\r\nthis district point rather to a connection with Kent [the country of\r\nthe British tribe of Cantii] than with Wessex.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the precise state of the case with regard to these\r\ndetails, it may be taken as certain that the present population of\r\nHertfordshire is mainly descended from the Saxons who came to Britain\r\nin the fifth and sixth centuries. There must have been, however,\r\na certain mixture of ancient British blood; while later, and more\r\nespecially among the higher classes, this was followed by the infusion\r\nof a Norman strain. Otherwise the population of the county does not\r\nappear to have been much influenced by foreign immigration, although\r\nthere was a settlement of Huguenots in St Albans, who have left\r\ntheir mark in the name of one of the streets--French Row--near the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: French Row, St Albans]\r\n\r\nPassing on to the present day, we have the somewhat curious anomaly\r\nthat the population of the administrative county is somewhat larger\r\nthan that of the original county; this being due to the inclusion in\r\nthe former of some thickly populated areas. The population of the\r\nadministrative county in the census of 1901 was given as 258,423; ten\r\nyears previously it was 226,587, thus showing a very marked increase;\r\nthat of the ancient county was 250,152 persons. The number of persons\r\nto a square mile in Hertfordshire, on the latter basis at the former\r\ndate, was thus about 398, against 558 for England and Wales generally.\r\nDuring the last twenty-five years the increase of the population\r\nhas mainly taken place on the three great lines of railways, the\r\nGreat Northern, the Midland, and the North-Western, at such places\r\nas Barnet, Hitchin, St Albans, Harpenden, and Watford. St Albans has\r\nindeed altogether outstripped the county town in point of numbers;\r\nits population being 16,019 in 1901 against the 9,322 of Hertford. In\r\ncommon with England generally, there has of late years been a marked\r\ntendency for the rural population to migrate to the larger villages and\r\ntowns; and this dominance of the urban population has been accentuated\r\nby the transference to St Albans and elsewhere of large manufacturing\r\nand printing establishments from the metropolis. The urban districts\r\non the lines of railway likewise constitute the residence of a large\r\npopulation of men having daily business in London.\r\n\r\nAs in the country generally, the females in 1901 largely exceeded the\r\nmale population in numbers; the total for the former being 18,176, and\r\nfor the latter 16,723. The great majority of these lived in houses,\r\nof which 54,963 were inhabited at the date in question. In addition\r\nto these, 71 were living in military barracks; something like another\r\n5,200 were maintained in workhouses, hospitals, asylums, industrial\r\nschools, etc., while barges on the canals accounted for about another\r\n147. It should be added that the county contains several large London\r\nasylums; it would therefore give a very exaggerated proportion, as\r\ncompared with the true state of the case, if the number of lunatics\r\nresident in the county were quoted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient House at Welwyn, now the Police Station]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Agriculture--Main Cultivations, Woodlands, Stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the greater portion of Hertfordshire, that is\r\nto say, most of the chalk area, exclusive of the downs, commons,\r\nwoods, and private parks, was in former years devoted to corn, for the\r\ncultivation of which its soil is particularly well suited. Indeed the\r\ncounty had the reputation of growing not only the best barley for\r\nmalting, but likewise the best wheat-straw (that is to say, the hardest\r\nand whitest) for plaiting. The wheat itself was also of specially good\r\nquality and hardness, and there was likewise an abundance of mills\r\nin which it could be converted into flour. A noteworthy feature of\r\nHertfordshire agriculture is the practice of mixing chalk with the\r\nsoils, especially where they are clayey; this resulting in a decided\r\nincrease in fertility.\r\n\r\nA century and a half ago wheat, barley, and oats formed the chief\r\ncereal crops; beans being better suited to the Vale of Aylesbury, while\r\npeas are profitable only on the very light chalky grounds. Clover,\r\nlucerne, trefoil, turnips, and (in later times) swedes and mangold\r\nare also extensively grown. In this connection it is interesting to\r\nnote that the first crops of red clover and of swede turnips ever\r\ngrown in this country were sown at Broadby Farm, near Berkhampstead;\r\na spot celebrated in literature as having been the home of Peter the\r\nWild Boy in 1725. A certain amount of grass land was intermingled with\r\nthat under cereal and root cultivation; while, as mentioned in earlier\r\nsections, most of the heavy land in the south and south-east of the\r\ncounty is under grass.\r\n\r\n“Hertfordshire farming,” observes a recent writer, “has undergone\r\nlittle material change since Ellis’s description of it in 1732; the\r\nhay-crop has become a more prominent feature perhaps, potatoes on the\r\nlighter soils have gained a leading place in the rotation, and the\r\nstandard of fertility has been raised all round; otherwise a farm on\r\nthe high chalk-plateau was farmed in 1732 pretty much on the same lines\r\nas it is to-day. Ellis gives a list of the chief weeds, ‘crow-garlick,\r\nwild oat, carlock, poppy, mayweed, bindweed, dock, crow-needle, black\r\nbent’: they are not less troublesome nor any nearer extinction at the\r\npresent time, the last grass in particular being very characteristic of\r\ncorn-land on the ‘clay with flints’.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Hertfordshire Farm near Rickmansworth]\r\n\r\nEvery year the Board of Agriculture publishes a return in which the\r\nnumber of acres in each county devoted to each particular kind of\r\ncrop is duly recorded, the classification adopted being as follows,\r\nviz.: corn crops; green crops; clover, sainfoin, and grasses for hay;\r\ngrass not for hay; flax; hops; small fruits; and orchards. Such land\r\nas produces none of these crops is classed as bare fallow, of which\r\nHertfordshire in 1905 possessed 14,275 acres.\r\n\r\nOf the total of 402,856[2] acres in the county, 329,641 were\r\nunder cultivation in that year; 1917 were orchards, 26,568 were\r\nwoodland, while 1657 acres consisted of heaths and commons used as\r\ngrazing-grounds. At the same date there were 116,700 acres under\r\ncorn-cultivation; that is to say, something approaching one-fourth the\r\ntotal acreage, against about one-seventh in Kent. Green crops accounted\r\nfor 32,702 acres, while of the remainder there were 36,831 under\r\nclover, sainfoin, and grasses, 3315 under lucerne, meadows claimed\r\n54,589 acres, pasture 70,678, and small fruits 544. Of the corn-grazing\r\narea, wheat occupied 51,691, oats 36,946, and barley 27,960 acres.\r\n\r\n[2] See page 8 and footnote.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that out of the 329,641 acres of cultivated\r\nland no less than 200,000, or more than half the whole area of the\r\ncounty, and about 60 per cent. of the total farming land, was still\r\nunder the plough; this large proportion being at the time exceeded\r\nonly in six English counties. The increase in permanent pasture has,\r\nhowever, been steadily progressing since the great fall in the price\r\nof cereals in the seventies; this being aided by the improvements in\r\nthe means of communication throughout the country, which have tended\r\nto rob Hertfordshire of its original special advantage (owing to its\r\nproximity) in the matter of supplying the metropolis with corn and\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Hertfordshire agriculture cannot be dismissed without\r\nmention of the fact that the world-renowned agricultural station at\r\nRothamsted, in Harpenden parish, founded and endowed by the late Sir J.\r\nB. Lawes, is included within its limits. This includes a laboratory,\r\nunder a Director, situated on the west side of Harpenden common, and\r\ncertain plots of land in the park at Rothamsted where agricultural\r\nexperiments have been carried on for more than sixty years. The whole\r\nstation is administered by a committee, mainly appointed by the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nFruit is grown only to a comparatively small extent in Hertfordshire.\r\nVery characteristic of the county are, however, the orchards (now for\r\nthe most part more or less neglected) of small black cherries, known\r\nas Hertfordshire blacks, and also as “mazzards,” which are situated\r\nnear the homesteads of most of the older farms. These are probably a\r\ncultivated variety of the wild black cherry of the neighbouring woods.\r\n\r\nOn the rich-soiled, low-lying lands of the Lea valley on the\r\nsouth-eastern side of the county are situated numerous market-gardens\r\nand nurseries. The growing of tomatos (at Harpenden), cucumbers, and\r\ngrapes under glass is carried on in several parts of the county on a\r\nmore or less extensive scale.\r\n\r\nElm, oak, beech, and ash form the most common timber-trees of the\r\ncounty, but the predominance of each kind in particular districts\r\ndepends, as already mentioned, on the nature of the geological\r\nformation. The undergrowth in the woods, which should be cut every 12\r\nor 13 years, consists mainly of hazel.\r\n\r\nAs regards the number of the larger and commoner kinds of domesticated\r\nanimals, sheep in 1905 reached a total of 94,461, or about 234 to every\r\n1000 acres; the average for England generally being 445 per 1000 acres.\r\nThe prevailing breeds are the Hampshire Down, the South Down, and the\r\nDorset; the latter being favoured on account of their early lambing.\r\n\r\nHertfordshire is not a great horse-breeding county, and in 1905 the\r\nnumber of these animals was only 15,070. Cattle numbered 38,636, and\r\npigs 25,338. Shorthorns are the favourite breed of cattle among the\r\nfarmers; and although in the chalk districts the soil is not specially\r\nwell suited for dairy purposes, farms near the main railways despatch a\r\nconsiderable amount of milk to London. The number of horses was nearly\r\nthe same as in 1901, but cattle showed an increase of nearly 2000 head.\r\nSheep, however, had decreased by over 2000 and pigs by more than 6000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Special Cultivations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important special cultivation in Hertfordshire is undoubtedly\r\nwatercress, which is very extensively grown in the river-valleys over\r\na broad belt of country extending from the Welwyn district, through\r\nthe parishes of Harpenden, Wheathampstead and Redbourn, and thence to\r\nAmersham and Rickmansworth, as well as to the Vale of Aylesbury in\r\nBuckinghamshire; this district being reported to be the best in England\r\nfor this particular crop. The cress is grown in beds cut through the\r\nlow-ground from one bend of the river to another, so that a constant,\r\nbut regulated stream of water is continually flowing through. The seed\r\nis sown in special beds, and the young cress carefully planted out in\r\nregular rows in the mud of the permanent beds during the autumn. Much\r\ncare has to be exercised in tending and weeding the crop, from which\r\ntwo prolonged cuttings are obtained annually; the spring cutting being,\r\nhowever, much larger and better than the autumn one.\r\n\r\nAfter cutting, the watercress is tied up in bundles and packed in\r\nflat, oblong, osier hampers, or baskets; of which, during the spring\r\nseason, huge stacks may be seen at the local railway stations awaiting\r\ndespatch, either to the metropolis, or to the great manufacturing towns\r\nof the Midlands. For ordinary purposes the land on which watercress\r\nis grown is almost valueless; but the watercress beds yield a big\r\nrental. To furnish material for the aforesaid watercress hampers, as\r\nwell as for basket-work generally, osiers are cultivated in some of the\r\nriver-valleys, as in the Lea a mile or so above Wheathampstead, where\r\nthere are extensive beds.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the cultivation of watercress in the\r\nHarpenden-Redbourn district is that of lavender at Hitchin, where\r\nnumerous fields on a spur of the chalk range near Windmill Hill are\r\ndevoted to the growth of this fragrant plant. In late summer or early\r\nautumn the terminal spikes of blossom are nipped from their long stems,\r\nand garnered for the sake of their contained oil, which is distilled\r\ninto lavender-water in Hitchin itself. Lavender-water has been\r\nproduced at Hitchin for a period of fully eighty years. The growing of\r\nlavender as an industry is extremely restricted in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Lavender Field, Hitchin]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Industries and Manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will be inferred from the statements in earlier chapters with regard\r\nto its essentially agricultural nature, Hertfordshire is in no wise\r\na manufacturing county like Lancashire or Yorkshire; this being due,\r\nno doubt, in great part to the fact that it possesses no commercially\r\nvaluable minerals of its own, or, at all events, none which are at\r\npresent accessible to the miner.\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of a century or so a certain number of\r\nmanufacturing and industrial establishments have been moved from\r\nLondon and set up in various parts of the county, as at St Albans and\r\nelsewhere; but these cannot be termed Hertfordshire industries in the\r\nproper sense of the term, and do not need further mention.\r\n\r\nOne of the great industries of the county is the malting business\r\ncarried on at Ware, as is indicated by the number of cowls over the\r\ndrying-kilns, which form conspicuous objects for miles round. Ware was\r\nthe greatest malting place in England. The method of malting is too\r\nwell known and the industry too widely spread to call for any special\r\nnotes on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn former years, say up to about 1865, the straw-plait industry\r\nafforded employment to a whole army of workers in north-western Herts\r\nand the neighbouring districts of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire;\r\nand at that date the women and children might be seen in summer\r\nplaiting the straw at almost every cottage-door in each village or\r\ntown. As already mentioned, the chalk districts of the county grow\r\nwheat-straw specially well suited for plait. The straws to be used\r\nwere selected and pulled one by one from the sheaves before the latter\r\nwere threshed; and, after having the corn-ears cut off, were done up\r\ninto bundles. The latter were in turn cut into such lengths as could\r\nbe obtained free from knots, and tied up into smaller bundles ready\r\nfor sale to the workers. Before being employed in plaiting, each straw\r\nwas split longitudinally into several strips by means of a brass\r\ninstrument, which consisted of a handle and a pointed, star-shaped head\r\nbent down at right angles to the former. The finished plait was sold\r\nat so much per “score” (that is to say twenty yards) for manufacture\r\ninto hats and bonnets. Cheap Chinese labour has completely killed the\r\nlocal plaiting industry; but the manufacture of the finished foreign\r\nplait into hats still constitutes an important trade in St Albans and\r\nelsewhere, as well as at Luton and Dunstable in Bedfordshire; the\r\nsewing of the plait into hats being done mainly, if not entirely, in\r\nlarge factories. Tring was a great plait centre.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of textile fabrics was formerly carried on in several\r\nparts of the county, but in most of these has either completely ceased\r\nor fallen into decline. About 1802 there were mills for the manufacture\r\nboth of silk and cloth at Rickmansworth; and the occurrence of the name\r\n“Fuller Street” in the records of St Albans apparently indicates the\r\nexistence at some unknown date of the latter industry in that city, and\r\nthere were certainly cotton-mills at Sopwell, to the south of it. The\r\nAbbey silk-mills, on the Ver, are still working at St Albans, although\r\nwith a much diminished output; but those at the neighbouring village of\r\nRedbourn have been recently closed. Tring had silk-mills, and canvas\r\nwas also made there. Lace-making was probably carried on by some of\r\nthe cottagers on the Buckinghamshire side of the county, where it\r\nflourishes to a certain extent at the present day, and may even still\r\nhere and there survive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moor Park, near Rickmansworth]\r\n\r\nNowadays perhaps the most important manufacturing industry in the\r\ncounty is that carried on at the paper-mills at Abbot’s Langley, where\r\na large amount of high class paper is turned out. Being on the canal,\r\nthese mills have the advantage of water-carriage. Paper, it may be\r\nobserved, is made nowadays from wood-pulp and esparto grass, as well as\r\nfrom linen rags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canal and Lock, Rickmansworth]\r\n\r\nBrick-making employs a considerable number of hands in various parts\r\nof the county; the glacial and other superficial deposits on the chalk\r\narea frequently yielding excellent brick-earth; while the London\r\nclay may be employed for brick-making anywhere in the south-eastern\r\ndistricts. Bricks from the London clay, which is naturally blue, turn\r\nyellow or white after burning in consequence of the combustion of the\r\norganic colouring matter; but many of those from the glacial clays are\r\nof a full rich red At Pepperstock, near Caddington, however, there are\r\nmanufactured certain very hard, heather-coloured bricks, which are much\r\nfavoured for house-building in north-western Hertfordshire, although\r\ntheir colour compares very unfavourably in the matter of effect when\r\ncontrasted with the “brick-red” of the more ordinary kinds.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Gault plain of Bedfordshire numerous cement works\r\nmay be seen at the edge of the chalk-marl near the northern borders of\r\nthe county, some of which may be within the county itself. Chalk is\r\nmuch worked, as at Hitchin and elsewhere, for lime; and, as already\r\nmentioned, is dug largely by the farmers for “chalking” their fields.\r\nIt is to such diggings that the deep circular pits (now generally\r\nploughed over) to be seen in many arable fields are due. The Totternhoe\r\nstone has been, and perhaps still is, quarried locally for building in\r\nsome parts of the northern districts of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Minerals--An Exhausted Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving referred in the last section to brick-making, lime, cement, and\r\nTotternhoe stone, very little remains for mention in the present one;\r\nas the absence of mines is one of the features of Hertfordshire and the\r\nadjacent counties.\r\n\r\nReference may, however, again be made to the so-called coprolite beds\r\nof the chalk-marl which were worked in the neighbourhood of Hitchin\r\nin the early part of the first half of last century as a source of\r\nphosphoric acid for agricultural manure. The irregularly shaped black\r\nnodules of phosphate of lime occur crowded together in a comparatively\r\nthin bed. They were dug out, and washed from the marl in which they\r\nwere embedded on the spot in large circular tanks through which a\r\nwheel was made to revolve by horse-labour; and then carted away to\r\nbe converted by a chemical process into superphosphate. After the\r\nexcavation of the coprolite bed from one strip of a field, the marl\r\nfrom the next was thrown in, and the top soil replaced, so that the\r\nland was left in as good, or even better, condition than previously.\r\nThe industry was continued till all the beds situated at or above a\r\nlevel which it paid to work were exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn winter there is a considerable local trade in gravel and shingle,\r\ndug mainly in the valleys. Twenty years ago this trade was much more\r\nextensive in some districts than is at present the case; this being due\r\npartly to the exhaustion of the deposits, partly to the fact that in\r\ndistricts served by the Midland Railway the use of syenite from Mount\r\nSorrel and Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire, has to a considerable\r\nextent replaced flint-gravel as road-metal on the main highways of\r\nthe county and in the metropolitan districts. Formerly, very large\r\nquantities of gravel were sent from St Albans and Harpenden to the\r\nnorthern metropolitan suburbs such as Hendon and Child’s Hill; but\r\nmost of that now dug is employed for road-metal on the local by-roads.\r\nHere it should be mentioned that in Hertfordshire phraseology the term\r\n“gravel” is used exclusively to denote the coarse big-stoned material\r\nused as road-metal; what is ordinarily denoted as “gravel”--that is\r\nto say the material employed for garden-paths--being locally known as\r\n“hoggin.” Flints picked from the fields of the chalk area have a higher\r\nvalue as road-metal than dug gravel, owing to their superior hardness;\r\nthe so-called “quarry-water,” which is present in all dug gravel,\r\nhaving been long since dried out.\r\n\r\n“Facing” flints for building purposes is an art much less commonly\r\npractised in the county than was the case in earlier days; and when\r\nbuildings of faced flint are contemplated it is generally necessary to\r\nsend to a distance in order to secure the services of an expert in the\r\nfacing process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. History of Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Hertfordshire includes such a number of events of\r\nprimary importance that it is somewhat difficult to make a selection\r\nof those most fitted to appear in the limited space available. It was\r\nin this county that the offer of the crown of England was made to\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, and it was from here that the first petition for\r\nthe redress of grievances was forwarded to Charles I; while several\r\nimportant battles have been fought within its limits.\r\n\r\nTo the two British tribes who inhabited this part of England previous\r\nto the Roman invasion, reference has been made in an earlier section.\r\nThe first landing of Julius Caesar took place (in Kent) in 55 B.C.,\r\nand the second and more successful in 54 B.C.; while a third Roman\r\ninvasion took place under Claudius in 43 A.D., from which date the\r\nRoman legions held possession of the whole country till about the year\r\n410 A.D. Whether Caesar himself ever visited Verulam does not appear\r\nto be definitely ascertained, but it was early in the history of that\r\ngreat city that the encounter between the British Queen Boadicea and\r\nthe Romans took place. During the Roman period Hertfordshire, which\r\nthen appears to have been a well-populated and wealthy district, formed\r\na part of the province of Flavia Caesariensis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Monastery Gateway, St Albans]\r\n\r\nThe next great event was the Saxon Conquest, which in Kent was ushered\r\nin by the landing of a force in the year 449 A.D. During this part of\r\nits history the western, or larger portion of our county was included,\r\nas already mentioned, in the kingdom of Mercia, while the eastern and\r\nsmaller section belonged to that of Essex. Of the numerous Mercian\r\nkings, the most renowned and most powerful was Offa, whose name\r\nsurvives in Offley, where he had a palace, and where he died about the\r\nyear 796, while still engaged in building the Monastery and Abbey of St\r\nAlban. Mercia at this time made a bid for the supremacy of the petty\r\nkingdoms of this part of England, but was eventually beaten by Wessex\r\nunder the able rule of Egbert.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of the last-mentioned sovereign that invaders of\r\nanother nationality--namely the Danes--began to make their presence\r\nseriously felt in the south; but it was not till the time of his son\r\nand successor Aethelwulf that they landed on the east coast. Early in\r\nhis reign a council of Mercians and West Saxons was held at Kingsbury,\r\nnear St Albans, to devise means for repelling the invaders; while a\r\nsecond assembly was called for the same purpose at Bennington in the\r\nyear 850. Neither seems to have resulted in effectual measures, for in\r\n851 we find a large Danish fleet which had sailed up the Thames beating\r\noff one of the Saxon kings, who had marched to stop its progress; and\r\nafter this event the county was harried and raided time after time,\r\ntill it was eventually divided about the year 880 by a treaty executed\r\nat Wedmore between the Saxon sovereign Alfred and Guthrum the Dane by\r\na boundary line running from the mouth of the Lea to its source, and\r\nthence straight across country to Bedford. A few years later, however,\r\nnamely in 894, the Danish fleet sailed up the Lea to Hertford, where\r\nAlfred crippled it by cutting into the banks of the river, so that by\r\nloss of water the vessels became stranded, and the Danish force had to\r\nfight its way to the west of England. After numerous skirmishes and\r\nfights, and the building of forts at Hertford and on a small island\r\nnear Bishop’s Stortford, the Danish invasion was practically crushed\r\nby King Edward, who died in 925. Much, however, still remained to be\r\ndone by his son Aethelstan, who stoutly attacked the invaders after\r\nthey had made a raid on St Albans in 930. A memorial of the Danish\r\nsojourn still exists in Dacorum, the name of the western hundred in\r\nwhich Tring is situated; there is also evidence to the same effect in\r\nthe records of gifts to St Albans Abbey by Danes who had settled in the\r\nneighbourhood. The Mercian shire-system, which was probably instituted\r\nas an aid against the Danes, is known to have come into force by 957;\r\nbut in place of Hertfordshire having a sheriff of its own, it shared\r\none with Essex; an arrangement which remained in force till the reign\r\nof Elizabeth. This was in Edgar’s reign (957–975); but even then we do\r\nnot reach the end of the Danish trouble, which did not cease till after\r\nSweyn’s invasions between the years 1011 and 1014, which were worse\r\nthan their predecessors, and included the pillage of Canterbury. About\r\nthis time occurs the first mention of “Heorotford” as the name of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the country recovered, in greater or less degree, from the\r\nDanish raids than it was conquered by the Normans under William I, who\r\nsoon after the battle of Hastings marched through the country south\r\nof the Thames till he reached Berkhampstead in this county, where he\r\nbuilt the castle whose foundations and earthworks remain to this day.\r\nBy relentless severity against all who stood in his way on the march,\r\nWilliam had succeeded in instilling a wholesome fear into the Saxon\r\n(or, as we now say, English) inhabitants of the country; and, although\r\nhe is reported to have been successfully opposed by Frederic, Abbot of\r\nSt Albans, he was finally tendered the submission of the people and the\r\nEnglish crown at Berkhampstead.\r\n\r\nTo follow in detail the events of the troublous times which succeeded\r\nthe conquest is here impossible; and it must suffice to state that at\r\nChristmas, 1116, Henry I paid a visit to St Albans for the purpose\r\napparently of quelling trouble among the turbulent Norman barons who\r\nhad now become the paramount lords. Stephen also held a court at St\r\nAlbans in 1143 in connection with other troubles. With the bare mention\r\nthat several Hertfordshire barons accompanied Richard I in his crusade\r\nto the Holy Land, we may pass on to the quarrel between King John and\r\nhis barons, which has a very intimate connection with our county; among\r\nthe opposing noblemen being Robert Fitzwalter, their leader, and the\r\nEarls of Essex and of Hertford. The barons advanced from Northampton to\r\nBedford, while the main body of their army marched to Ware and thence\r\nto London. The signing of Magna Charta produced temporary peace; but\r\nthis was soon succeeded by fiercer fighting than ever in this county.\r\nAt the commencement of 1215 John himself was in St Albans, and also had\r\npossession of Hertford and Berkhampstead castles. In May of the same\r\nyear Louis landed from France, and in due course besieged Hertford and\r\nBerkhampstead till they surrendered, and then proceeded to St Albans,\r\nwhere he was for some time defied by the abbot. At the departure of\r\nLouis the castles were restored to the king.\r\n\r\nThe next event is the looting of St Albans by Fulke de Breauté and his\r\nband in 1217.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the barons continued into the reign of Henry III; and\r\nin the year 1261 the autumn parliament was held at St Albans. Up to\r\n1295 the shires alone sent representatives to parliament but in the\r\nsession held at St Albans in that year the cities, boroughs, and chief\r\ntowns were each permitted to elect two parliamentary burgesses. During\r\nthe reign of Edward II the county was considerably involved in the\r\naffairs of Sir Piers de Gaveston, who spent much of his time at King’s\r\nLangley, where Edward had a palace, and where Gaveston was buried after\r\nhis execution in 1312. During that year the papal envoy met the barons\r\nat St Albans with a view to the settlement of their differences with\r\nthe king; and in July, 1321, the barons marched through that city on\r\ntheir way to London. During the fourteenth century the county suffered\r\nseverely from plague; but in spite of this Edward III spent much time\r\nat Langley; and in 1361 the king and queen came to Berkhampstead to\r\ntake leave of the Black Prince (to whom the castle had been given)\r\nprevious to his departure for Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nIn 1381, owing to exactions on the part of the king and the abbot of St\r\nAlbans, there broke out the peasants’ revolt, in which Hertfordshire\r\nmen took a large share. Indeed after the execution of Wat Tyler the\r\nking proposed to go himself to St Albans to punish the insurgents, but\r\nwas persuaded to send a commission in his stead; although a short time\r\nlater, after another riot, his majesty appeared in person in that city\r\nat the head of an armed force.\r\n\r\nWith the bare mention that in the second year of his reign King\r\nHenry IV visited the abbey, we pass on to the Wars of the Roses, and\r\nespecially the first battle of St Albans, which was fought in May,\r\n1455. The Lancastrians, or royalists, held the main street of the city\r\ntill the Yorkists, under the leadership of the Duke of Warwick, burst\r\nthrough the defences from the direction of Sopwell and cut the royalist\r\nposition in half. In less than an hour they had the city in their own\r\nhands, after a great carnage, during which King Henry VI himself was\r\nwounded. In 1458 the king visited Berkhampstead with the object of\r\nquelling the strife, but to no purpose; and in February, 1461, the\r\ntwo factions again fought an engagement at St Albans, this time at\r\nBernard’s Heath, to the northward of St Peter’s Church. This second\r\nbattle of St Albans ended in a victory for the king. On 14th April,\r\n1471, Edward defeated Warwick in the great battle of Barnet, on the\r\nsouth-east border of the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Staircase, Hatfield House]\r\n\r\nHertfordshire had much to do with royalty during the reign of King\r\nHenry VIII, the palace at King’s Langley being bestowed on Queen\r\nCatherine, while the king himself spent much time at Hunsdon House, and\r\nalso had a residence at Tittenhanger. There is, moreover, a tradition\r\nthat he was married to Anne Boleyn at Sopwell. The Princess Mary lived\r\nfor a time at Hertford Castle previous to her removal to Hunsdon, where\r\nPrincess Elizabeth also lived before her long sojourn at Hatfield, in\r\nwhich beautiful park she was informed of her accession to the throne.\r\nWhen queen, Elizabeth continued to be a frequent visitor to the county;\r\nand in her reign, owing to plague in London, the law courts were held\r\nfor a time at St Albans, while, for the same reason, Parliament sat\r\nat Hertford in 1564 and 1581. The sovereign herself came as a guest\r\nto Lord Burleigh at Theobalds, to the Earl of Essex at Cassiobury,\r\nand to Sir Nicholas Bacon at Gorhambury. James I likewise spent much\r\ntime in the county, having an establishment at Royston, and dying at\r\nTheobalds. During the civil wars Hertfordshire men played an important\r\npart in connection with what was known as the Eastern Association; and\r\nin 1643, when the High Sheriff ventured to read a royal proclamation\r\nin the market-place at St Albans, he was arrested by Cromwell himself.\r\nTo follow the fortunes of Hertfordshire during the conflict between\r\nCharles I and Parliament would occupy too much space; and it must\r\nsuffice to mention that in 1660 Sir Harbottle Grimston of Gorhambury\r\nwas Speaker of the House of Commons and took a leading part in the\r\nrestoration of King Charles II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cassiobury]\r\n\r\nThe last event in the history of the county to which space admits\r\nallusion is the Rye House Plot. “In the spring of 1683,” to quote the\r\nwords of a well-known local writer, “Charles II and James Duke of York\r\nwent to see the races at Newmarket. Just opposite to the Rye House Inn\r\nthere stood then a castle, built in the days of Henry VI, and in that\r\ncastle lived one Rumbold, formerly an officer in the parliamentary\r\narmy. Rumbold and about a score of equally reckless malcontents put\r\ntheir heads together over their tankards, and, so far as can be\r\ngathered from many rather contradictory narratives, they formed a\r\nplot to delay the royal party on the return journey from Newmarket to\r\nLondon, by placing an overturned cart in the road-way, in order that\r\nthey might shoot the King and the Duke of York in the confusion. The\r\nconspiracy was frustrated, for the royal party returned earlier than\r\nRumbold had been led to expect, and presently the plot leaked out.\r\nThe Rye House was searched, incriminating papers were discovered, and\r\nthe affair culminated in the arrest of those nobler patriots who, in\r\nconcert with Argyle, had been planning the overthrow of what they\r\nhonestly regarded as a corrupt government.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rye House. Portions of the Servants Quarters]\r\n\r\nThe Rye House, it may be added, is situated in the south-eastern border\r\nof the county, a short distance north-east of Hoddesdon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Antiquities--Prehistoric, Roman, Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe earliest evidence of the presence of man in Hertfordshire is\r\nafforded, as elsewhere in this country, not by written or sculptured\r\nrecords, but by stone implements of various shapes and types. The very\r\nearliest of these implements, at any rate, belong to a time when the\r\nmammoth inhabited this country, which was then united to the continent;\r\nand their age must be reckoned by thousands, if not by tens of\r\nthousands, of years. The period to which all these implements belong,\r\nbeing before all human records, is known as the Prehistoric; and it is\r\nimportant to mention that this term should be restricted to the epoch\r\nintervening between the time of the formation of the uppermost portion\r\nof the Tertiary beds and the first dawn of history. We often find the\r\nterm “prehistoric monsters” applied to the great reptiles of the Chalk\r\nand Oolites; but such a usage, although etymologically justifiable, is\r\ntechnically wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Prehistoric period for lack of all other means of dating has\r\nbeen divided by antiquarians, according to the material of which man\r\nformed his implements, into the Stone, the Bronze, and the late-Celtic\r\nor Iron Ages; the Stone age being further divided into an older, or\r\nPalaeolithic, section, in which all the so-called “celts,” or flint\r\nimplements, were formed simply by chipping, and a newer Neolithic\r\nsection, in which they were often ground and polished. In connection\r\nwith these implements attention may be directed to some of the\r\nancient earthworks in the county, although the age of many of these is\r\nunknown, and in some cases may be later than the Roman occupation. The\r\nantiquities newer than the late-Celtic age are described as referable\r\nto the Roman or the Saxon period, as the case may be. These correspond\r\nwith the history of England from 55 B.C. to 1066 A.D.\r\n\r\nPalaeolithic implements are found locally in certain parts of the\r\ncounty, although from the gravels of a very considerable area,\r\nespecially the Harpenden district, they appear to be absent. The larger\r\nimplements, or “celts,” which are often six or seven inches in length,\r\nseem to have been employed for all purposes, and to have been held in\r\nthe hand, without handle or shaft, although some of them might easily\r\nbe used as spear-heads. The first discovery of an implement of this\r\ntype in the county was made near Bedmond, Abbot’s Langley, in 1861. A\r\nfew specimens have been obtained in other parts of the Colne basin;\r\nbut in the district round Kensworth and Caddington vast numbers have\r\nbeen discovered, although for the most part just outside the county\r\nboundary. In fact, near Caddington the Stone-age men had a great\r\nmanufactory of these implements:--a kind of Palaeolithic Sheffield. In\r\nthe basin of the Lea a few flakes, etc., have been found at or near\r\nAyot St Peter, Welwyn, Hertford, Bengeo, Ware, Amwell, Hoddesdon,\r\nIppolits, Stocking Pelham, and elsewhere. Much more important is a\r\n“find” at Hitchin, near the source of the Hiz, and thus situated, in\r\npart at any rate, in the Ouse basin. These implements, which were first\r\nbrought to notice in 1877, occur in clay-pits worked for brick-earth,\r\nand are accompanied by bones of the mammoth, hippopotamus, and\r\nrhinoceros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palaeolithic Flint Implement\r\n\r\n(_From Kent’s Cavern, Torquay_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Neolithic Celt of Greenstone\r\n\r\n(_From Bridlington, Yorks._)]\r\n\r\nBetween the Palaeolithic and Neolithic age exists a gap of untold\r\nlength, for the land had again to be re-peopled. Chipped, or rough-hewn\r\ncelts, or hatchets, of the latter age have been picked up in fields\r\nnear Abbot’s Langley, Bedmond, Kensworth, Wheathampstead, Markyate\r\nStreet, and Weston. Polished celts are more rare, but specimens have\r\nbeen found at Panshanger, King’s Langley, Aldbury (near Stortford),\r\nAshwell, and between Hitchin and Pirton. Perforated axe-heads and\r\nhammer-heads of stone, which may belong to the close of the Neolithic\r\nor commencement of the Bronze age, are still more uncommon, although\r\na few such have been found, notably a hammer, near Sandridge, now\r\npreserved in the British Museum. Much the same remark applies to\r\nchipped arrow-heads--the fairy darts of a more poetical age--but a few\r\nbeautiful specimens have been found near Tring, some so long ago as the\r\nyear 1763 or thereabouts, and others at Ashwell and Hunsdon.\r\n\r\nAfter a time man learnt the use of metal. The smelting of iron was\r\nat first beyond his power, and he employed the mixture of copper\r\nand tin which we term bronze. Of this age specimens of winged celts\r\nand palstaves (a narrow hatchet, with a tang or socket for a haft)\r\nhave been found in various parts of the county, as well as socketed\r\ncelts, daggers, swords, spear-heads, and the like. The most important\r\ndiscovery of this nature was made in 1876 during drainage operations at\r\nCumberlow Green, near Baldock, when some forty bronze implements were\r\nfound in a well-like hole. Gold ornaments, probably referable to the\r\nsame epoch, have been found at Little Amwell and at Mardox, near Ware.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the early Iron Age, when man had succeeded in mastering\r\nthis metal. Of this a very brief notice must suffice. Primitive coins,\r\nwithout inscription, of the type issued by Philip II of Macedon, and\r\nhence known as Philippi, were probably coined in the county in early\r\nBritish times; but after the Roman invasion a number of British coins\r\nwere struck at Verulamium, among the most interesting of which are\r\nthose of Tarciovanus, who reigned in that city from (probably) about\r\n30 B.C. to about 5 A.D. A large number of his coins have been found at\r\nVerulam, as well as those of other British sovereigns. Tarciovanus, it\r\nmay be added, was the father of Cunovelinus (Shakespeare’s Cymbeline),\r\nwhose capital was Camulodunum, the modern Colchester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Devil’s Dyke, Marford]\r\n\r\nEarthworks of great but unknown antiquity are by no means uncommon\r\nin Hertfordshire; one of the most important being Grimes-ditch, or\r\nGrimm’s Dyke, traces of which remain on Berkhampstead common, as well\r\nas on the opposite side of the Bulbourne valley, while a deep ditch\r\nruns in a bold sweep from near Great Berkhampstead through Northchurch\r\nand Wiggington to the north of Cholesbury camp, and thence into\r\nBuckinghamshire. Beech Bottom forms another great dyke lying between\r\nthe site of Verulam and Sandridge, and is probably pre-Roman, and\r\npossibly connected with the encampment east of Wheathampstead known\r\nas the Moats or the Slad. The latter forms part of a great system of\r\nearthworks of which the opposite side is marked by the Devil’s Dyke\r\nat Marford. The great earthworks running outside of and parallel to\r\nparts of the Roman wall at Verulam are likewise older than the latter.\r\nBerkhampstead Castle may stand on the site of an earlier camp, as\r\nBritish and Roman coins have been found there; but the mound or keep,\r\nas at Bishop’s Stortford, Pirton, and Hertford Castles, is probably\r\nSaxon. On the other hand, the well-preserved camp near Redbourn, known\r\nas the Aubreys, Auberys, or Aubury, is certainly pre-Roman; and the\r\nsame is probably the case with some of the numerous other earthworks\r\ndotted over the county, such as Arbury Banks, Ashwell. A few barrows or\r\ntombs of pre-Roman age have been opened and examined in various parts\r\nof the county, as at Therfield, Royston, and Easneye near Ware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Causeway, Verulam]\r\n\r\nIn evidence of the Roman occupation of Britain Hertfordshire is\r\nunusually rich, although limitations of space prevent anything like\r\njustice being done to this part of the subject. The county is, in the\r\nfirst place, traversed from south to north by three main Roman roads,\r\nthe Watling Street, running through St Albans and Markyate, the Ermine\r\nStreet, passing through Hertford, and the Icknield Way, traversing\r\nHatfield and Baldock; as well as by the Roman Way, connecting the\r\nlatter town with Hertford. Of these we shall speak presently. The\r\ncrowning Roman glory of Hertfordshire is, however, the city of\r\nVerulamium, or Verulam, situated on the hill on the opposite side of\r\nthe Ver to St Albans. Much of the foundations of this city lie buried\r\nwithin the area partially enclosed by the remains of the massive walls;\r\nand the ploughman within that ring is constantly turning up coins,\r\nfragments of pottery and glass, and other articles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Wall in St Germans’ Meadow, Verulam]\r\n\r\nIn one place are buried the apparently complete foundations of an\r\namphitheatre, which was opened out many years ago, but again covered\r\nup after examination. Of the walls considerable portions, in a more or\r\nless damaged condition, still remain to bear eloquent testimony to the\r\nlasting character of Roman masonry; and much more would have persisted\r\nhad they not been used as a convenient source of materials for the\r\nconstruction of St Albans’ Abbey and other ancient buildings. The\r\nbasement of a Roman villa, in a fine state of preservation, was opened\r\nout at Sarratt Bottom in 1908, and plans of the structure prepared,\r\nafter which the excavations were filled in. Other Roman remains are\r\nknown to exist in the district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Albans’ Abbey from the South Side]\r\n\r\nRavensburgh Castle, Hexton, is a well-known Roman camp, built on an\r\nearlier foundation; and remains of Roman camps exist at Braughing\r\nand several other places in the county, although in many cases the\r\nprecise age of such ancient stations does not appear to be definitely\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nIsolated Roman remains of various kinds occur in many parts of\r\nHertfordshire. From the writer’s own neighbourhood the British Museum\r\npossesses a Roman altar found many years ago at Harpenden, as well as\r\na Romano-British stone coffin, containing a glass vessel and pottery,\r\nfound near Pickford Mill in the Lea valley, east of Harpenden, in 1827.\r\nThe remains of another Roman interment, including fine specimens of\r\namphorae, or large two-handled pottery vessels, were found about the\r\nyear 1865 near Harpenden station on the Great Northern railway, and\r\nBarkway has yielded a fine bronze statuette of Mars.\r\n\r\nReference may here be made to the ancient millstones, for hand use,\r\nmade of Hertfordshire pudding-stone, and known as querns, of which the\r\nwriter gave two fine specimens from Harpenden to the British Museum.\r\nBoth stones have one flat and one convex surface, but the convexity\r\nis much greater in the upper stone, which is almost conical, and is\r\ncompletely perforated at the centre. When in use, a stick, to serve\r\nas the axis of rotation, was inserted in this hole and received in\r\na socket in the nether stone. The labour involved in making these\r\npudding-stone querns must have been enormous.\r\n\r\nWith the Saxon period we reach the age of church building; but\r\napart from such portions of certain churches as are of that age,\r\nHertfordshire is exceedingly poor in evidence of the Saxon dominion.\r\nA glass Anglo-Saxon basin, together with a bronze Frankish pot of\r\nlate sixth or early seventh century work, was, however, discovered at\r\nWheathampstead in 1886. Anglo-Saxon relics are believed also to have\r\nbeen unearthed at Redbourn at a very early period, when they were\r\nattributed to St Amphibalus; and a Saxon burial-place appears to have\r\nbeen found near Sandridge in modern times, although unfortunately\r\nploughed over. Apart from the above, there are only a few isolated\r\n“finds,” such as of the coins known as minimi, and of a gold ornament\r\ndiscovered at Park Street in 1744.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Architecture. (_a_) Ecclesiastical--Abbeys and Churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe architecture of Hertfordshire buildings may be most conveniently\r\ndiscussed under three separate sections, namely:--(_a_) ecclesiastical,\r\nor buildings related to the church; (_b_) military, or castles; and\r\n(_c_) domestic, or dwelling houses and cottages.\r\n\r\nAs in England generally, the architecture of the older buildings\r\nof all three classes has been affected to a greater or less degree\r\nby the nature of the building materials most easily accessible.\r\nThroughout the northern chalk area of the county the Totternhoe stone\r\nof Bedfordshire and the northern flanks of Hertfordshire was largely\r\nemployed in church building, both for inside and outside work, to\r\nthe latter of which it is but ill suited. Flint--in the better class\r\nof work “faced” or “dressed” by fracture so as to present a flattened\r\nouter face--was also very extensively used. The Norman builders\r\nof the tower of St Albans found, however, a quarry ready to their\r\nhands in the adjacent walls of Verulam, and we accordingly find this\r\npart of the structure made almost entirely of the characteristic\r\nRoman bricks or tiles. Contemporaneous brick was also locally used\r\nto a very considerable extent even in the chalk districts; and in\r\nthe north-western part of the county there are numerous beautiful\r\nexamples of Tudor brick chimneys, as at Water End. Timber in the old\r\ndays was, however, much cheaper than bricks, and we consequently find\r\nmany of the older buildings--especially cottages--constructed of a\r\nframework of wood, arranged in the fashion of a net, with the large\r\n“meshes” filled in with brick. This type of work is locally known as\r\nbrick and studding and to the architect as half-timbered work. Other\r\nbuildings were largely constructed of a wooden framework overlain with\r\nlath-and-plaster work.\r\n\r\nMany of the churches built of flint or Totternhoe stone have their\r\nangles or quoins made of harder material; in many instances of stone\r\napparently from Northamptonshire, but in other cases of Roman brick;\r\nsimilar materials being also used in the arches of some of the churches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Peter’s, Tewin]\r\n\r\nA large number of Hertfordshire churches have relatively low\r\nbattlemented towers, frequently with a short spire or steeple in the\r\ncentre as at Tewin, or a turret in one corner. Kensworth is an example\r\nof such a battlemented tower without either spire or turret; St\r\nMary’s, Hitchin, Tring, Northchurch, Barnet, Bushey, King’s Walden,\r\nCheshunt, and Watford are examples of towers with a turret in one\r\nangle, while at Ashwell there are turrets in all four corners. Some of\r\nthe smaller churches, like St Michael’s, St Albans, originally had no\r\naisles. Clothall church is peculiar in that the roof of the tower forms\r\na four-sided cone; while the roof of the church at Sarratt is equally\r\nunique in being saddle-backed, that is to say, having a ridge running\r\nat right angles to that of the roof of the nave and chancel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Mary’s, Cheshunt]\r\n\r\nApparently there is no wholly Saxon church in the county, although\r\nseveral of the older ones were constructed on the site of Saxon\r\nbuildings, many of which were probably of wood, and thus either\r\nperished through decay or were burnt during the Danish raids. On the\r\nother hand, there are remains of Saxon work in St Albans’ Abbey, and\r\nthere are several Hertfordshire churches which are referred with a\r\ngreater or less degree of certainty to the period before the Norman\r\nconquest; the original part of St Michael’s, in St Albans, and of St\r\nStephen’s, to the south-west of that town, may be cited as examples,\r\nboth dating from the middle of the tenth century. The church of\r\nSandridge--on the road from St Albans to Wheathampstead--may likewise\r\ndate from the same epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Helen’s, Wheathampstead]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Mary’s, Hemel Hempstead]\r\n\r\nOf Norman churches there are numerous examples, among which may be\r\ncited as a fine specimen St Mary’s, Hemel Hempstead, whose tall\r\noctagonal tower and spire are visible from a long distance. The\r\nNorman arches of the nave are of great solidity, while the western\r\ndoorway, dating from about 1140, is a magnificent example of the work\r\nof the period. Sarratt church is also largely Norman, as was also\r\nthe old church of St Nicholas, Harpenden, unfortunately pulled down\r\n(with the exception of the much later tower) nearly half a century\r\nago. A considerable portion of St Albans’ Abbey (now cathedral), the\r\npride of the whole county, is also Norman; the tower of Roman brick\r\nbeing, apart from modern additions, wholly of that period. The old\r\nSaxon Church of King Offa, which stood on or near the site of the\r\npresent building, appears to have been completely swept away by Abbot\r\nPaul of Caen (1077–1093), the founder of the present abbey, which\r\nalthough completed by him, was not consecrated till 1115. “It is to\r\nbe inferred,” according to the _Victoria History of Hertfordshire_,\r\n“that a clean sweep was made of the old buildings, and no evidence\r\nas to their site has been preserved. The Norman Abbot’s contempt for\r\nhis Saxon predecessors ... led him to destroy their tombs, and he\r\ndoubtless laid out his new building without attempting in any way to\r\naccommodate them to those previously existing on the site. But he\r\npreserved and used up in his new church some of the stonework of the\r\nold building, giving a very prominent place to the turned shafts which\r\nstill remain in the transept, and are the most notable relics of the\r\nSaxon building.” In the present nave, which is the second longest in\r\nEngland, the first six pillars on the north side belong to the original\r\nstructure of Abbot Paul; after which we come to Early English (Pointed)\r\nwork; this being continued to the west end of the building and back to\r\nthe fifth pillar on the south side, whence Decorated work extends to St\r\nCuthbert’s screen. The Norman work (1077–1093) of one side thus faces\r\nDecorated work (1308–1326) on the other, but this is due to accident\r\nrather than design, the Norman pillars having given way early in the\r\nchurch’s history. It has recently been suggested that the Abbey stands\r\non the site of the old Roman amphitheatre, and that St Peter’s Street,\r\nSt Albans, marks the position of the Roman _cursus_, or race-course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Albans’ Abbey]\r\n\r\nOf the Decorated style, in vogue during the reigns of the three\r\nEdwards, in other words, throughout the fourteenth century, in addition\r\nto the beautiful work in St Albans’ Abbey, we have examples in Abbot’s\r\nLangley, Clothall, and Hitchin churches. Abbot’s Langley has also some\r\nfine Norman work in the nave. Many of the churches of the Perpendicular\r\nperiod, like St Mary’s, Hitchin, have large and beautiful porches. Most\r\nof the windows in Abbot’s Langley church are Perpendicular, although\r\nsome on the south side are Decorated; and Tring and Offley churches are\r\nwholly of the Perpendicular style.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Reformation, Hertfordshire, like other counties,\r\npossessed numerous religious houses, such as priories, monasteries,\r\nnunneries, and hospitals; all of which, commencing with the smaller\r\nones, were suppressed by Henry VIII, whose chief agent in the work was\r\nThomas Cromwell. In many instances the sole evidence of the existence\r\nof such establishments is the survival of the word “Abbey” or “Priory”\r\nas the name of a private mansion, but sometimes their gateways, towers,\r\nor merely ruins, still remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins of Sopwell Nunnery, St Albans]\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of St Albans is especially rich in relics of this\r\nnature. To the south, on the banks of the Ver, are the famous ruined\r\nwalls of Sopwell Nunnery, a building known to have been in existence\r\nso early as 1119; but of the monastery there remains only the fine\r\ngate-house (long misused as a gaol), together with traces of the\r\ncloister arches on the south wall of the abbey. From documentary\r\nevidence, however, aided by excavations in the abbey orchard, it has\r\nbeen found possible to make a ground-plan of the whole establishment.\r\nThe last traces of the hospital of St Mary-de-Pré vanished only during\r\nthe last century; the name surviving in a private house by the Ver,\r\nwhich is known as the Pré.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Priory, Hitchin]\r\n\r\nHitchin formerly possessed a large priory, as is indicated by the\r\ndesignation of the home of the Delmé-Radcliffes; as well as by the\r\nexistence in the town itself of certain almshouses known as the\r\n“Biggin.” The latter were purchased by a private gentleman in 1545,\r\nbeing at that time part of the disestablished “Priory of Bygyng in the\r\ntown of Hychen.” The Biggin, which was once inhabited by Gilbertine\r\nnuns, has a beautiful wooden corridor. “The Priory” as the title of\r\na house in the main street of Redbourn, and “The Cell” as that of a\r\nmansion further down the road, at Markyate, are but two among many\r\nother traces of monastic institutions in the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtyard in the Biggin Almshouses, Hitchin]\r\n\r\nOf King’s Langley Priory, which is known to have been in existence in\r\n1400, a considerable portion still exists. Ashridge House now occupies\r\nthe site of a large monastery and college, of which there are many\r\nremains. A brief reference may here be made to St Albans’ clock-tower,\r\nwhich was erected between 1403 and 1412, and from which the curfew was\r\nrung till so late as 1861, while a bell was also rung early in the\r\nmorning to awaken work-people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Priory, King’s Langley]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Architecture. (_b_) Military--Castles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike most other counties in the south of England, Hertfordshire\r\npossesses the remains of several Norman castles, most of which\r\nappear to date back no further than the Conquest, while others, like\r\nBerkhampstead (where, as we have seen in a previous section, Mercian\r\nkings held their courts), have been supposed to be constructed on the\r\nsite of earlier buildings of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nThe total number of castles built by the Normans to overawe their\r\nnew English subjects is stated to have been about 1100. These, as may\r\nnaturally be surmised, varied considerably in size, some being royal\r\ncastles, constructed for the defence of the country generally and ruled\r\nby a constable or guardian, while others belonged to individual Norman\r\nnoblemen for the defence of their own estates, and were for the most\r\npart the terror of the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nA Norman castle of the highest type occupied a large area, the lofty\r\nand massive outer wall enclosing a space of several acres, and being\r\nsurmounted with towers and protected by bastions, while it was also\r\nsurrounded by a moat or ditch. Within the enclosure thus formed were\r\nthree main divisions, the first of which was the outer bailey, or\r\ncourtyard, entered by a towered gateway furnished with a portcullis\r\n(that is to say, a gate which could be dropped down from, and drawn\r\nup into, the tower by means of a system of chains and pulleys) and a\r\ndrawbridge. The stables and other buildings were contained in this\r\ncourt. Next came the inner bailey, or quadrangle, likewise entered\r\nthrough a towered and fortified gateway, and containing the chapel,\r\nthe barracks, and the keep. Lastly, we have the keep or donjon itself,\r\nwhich always contained a well, and constituted the final portion which\r\nwas defended during a protracted siege when the garrison was hard\r\npressed. In choosing the site for such a military castle, either a\r\nmore or less isolated and steep hill or rock might be selected, or a\r\nsituation in marshy low-lands, where access might be rendered difficult\r\nor impossible by damming back the waters.\r\n\r\nThe Norman castle at Berkhampstead, which stood close to the present\r\nrailway due east of the station, and portions of the ruins of which\r\nmay be seen from the train, was built by Robert Earl of Morton,\r\nbrother of William the Conqueror. According to a recent writer, the\r\nearthworks of this castle represent the original fortress founded by\r\nthe Conqueror, and the appellation of a “burh” to the structure is\r\nconsequently erroneous. A Saxon “burh” or “burg” was a fortified town,\r\nwhereas the moated mound of Berkhampstead, like those at Hertford,\r\nBishop’s Stortford, Anstey, Bennington, and Pirton, are essentially\r\nNorman castles of the type known as “mottes,” or, from their shape,\r\nas “mount and bailey castles.” It is a common idea that Berkhampstead\r\nwas originally a stone castle, but the earthworks now remaining really\r\nrepresent the fortress itself. In the reign of Henry II the custody of\r\nBerkhampstead Castle was entrusted to Thomas à Becket, who replaced\r\nthe old wooden defences (such as stockades, palisades, and towers)\r\noriginally crowning the banks, by walls of flint rubble, remains of\r\nwhich still partly surround the enclosure.\r\n\r\nHertford Castle, the site of which forms the residence of His Majesty’s\r\njudges during the assizes, was built by Edward the Elder about the year\r\n905; and after the conquest William I placed both castle and town in\r\nthe custody of Peter de Valoignes. Other ancient castles and baileys in\r\nthe county include the following, viz:--\r\n\r\nAnstey Castle, situated about a mile from the eastern border of\r\nHertfordshire, on the watershed between the Stort and the Quin.\r\nBennington Castle, built on high ground about a mile from the river\r\nBeane and some two miles from Walkern Bury; the ruins include the\r\nremains of a small, square keep, as well as of a bailey. Waytemore\r\nCastle, Bishop’s Stortford, belonging to the Bishop of London, is an\r\nexcellent example of the type of fortress which owes the main part of\r\nits strength to being situated in a practically impassable morass; that\r\nis to say, when the latter was kept well flooded. The flint rubble\r\nwalls of the keep are fully a dozen feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nSmaller baileys existed at High Down, near Pirton; at Periwinkle\r\nHill, on nearly level ground, midway between Reed and Barkway; and\r\nalso at Walkern, on the Beane, about a mile and a half distant from\r\nthe village. In the last of these it is noteworthy that the church is\r\nsituated close to the castle, although, unlike the one at Anstey, it\r\ndoes not appear to have been included in an outer ward.\r\n\r\nThe class of defensive works known as homestead moats--that is to say,\r\nsimple enclosures formed into islands by means of moats containing\r\nwater--do not, perhaps, strictly speaking, come under the title of\r\neither architectural or military structures. Still this seems the most\r\nconvenient place in which to mention them. The northern and eastern\r\ndistricts of Hertfordshire are remarkable for the enormous number of\r\nthese homestead moats; these districts being equalled in this respect\r\nonly by Essex and Suffolk. On the western side of the county they are\r\ncomparatively uncommon.\r\n\r\n“These enclosures,” observes a writer in the _Victoria History_ of the\r\ncounty, “vary greatly in size, shape, and position, and it is obvious\r\nthat they do not all belong to one period, for in all ages to surround\r\na piece of land with a ditch has been one of the most elementary forms\r\nof defence. There are, however, as with the larger earthworks, certain\r\ntypical forms.... It should be noted that the typical feature of a\r\nhomestead moat is that the earth, dug to form the deep surrounding\r\nditch, was thrown on to the inclosure and spread, thus raising the\r\nisland slightly above the surrounding level. The construction of moats,\r\nexcept for ornamental purposes, having ceased when the state of the\r\ncountry no longer necessitated such protective measures against men\r\nor wild beasts, they often fell into decay, or were partially filled\r\nup, and their vestiges converted into ponds, while many may have been\r\nobliterated as interfering with agriculture, but there still remain a\r\nlarge number.”\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the list of these would occupy far too much space; and it\r\nmust suffice to mention that examples of homestead moats may be seen in\r\nthe parishes of Ashwell, Braughing, Pirton, and Sawbridgeworth.\r\n\r\nA step in advance of the homestead moat was formed by earthworks\r\nmade on the same plan as the latter, but provided with a rampart and\r\na “fosse,” or ditch, and in some cases also with outer defences. Of\r\nthis type of earthwork three examples are definitely known to occur in\r\nthe county, namely one at Bygrave, a second at Whomerley Wood to the\r\nsouth-east of Stevenage, and a third at Well Wood, Watton.\r\n\r\nYet another kind of defensive earthwork is to be found in the shape of\r\nwalls, ramparts, or ditches surrounding the sites of ancient villages.\r\nOf this we have a local example in Kingsbury Castle, an old fortified\r\nvillage lying to the south-west of the city of St Albans, and covering\r\nan area of about 27½ acres. The village stood upon a hill, of which\r\nthe summit has been planed off and the material employed to form steep\r\nbanks or ramparts, one of which was partially thrown down to form the\r\npresent Verulam Road, while another portion persists in the shape of\r\na steep fall in the gardens or yards at the back of the houses on the\r\nnorth side of Fishpool Street. The main structure of the castle was\r\ndemolished during the tenth century, and the remnant about the year\r\n1152. It may be added that the clay-pits on the north side of Kingsbury\r\nCastle are the reputed source of the material of the Roman bricks of\r\nwhich Verulam is built.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic earthworks of the type of Beech Bottom and Grimm’s Dyke\r\nhave been mentioned in an earlier section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Architecture. (_c_) Domestic--Famous Seats, Manor Houses, Cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of less troublous times at the close of the Wars of\r\nthe Roses a marked change is noticeable in the plan and architecture\r\nof the residences of the great noblemen and country gentlemen. The\r\nneed for castles or fortified houses ceased to exist; and attention\r\nwas consequently directed to comfort rather than strength in the\r\nconstruction of country mansions. Fortunately a number of these fine\r\nold Tudor residences have survived in different parts of the country;\r\nbut many have been replaced by other later structures built on the old\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nThese Tudor mansions usually took the form of a large house built round\r\na quadrangle, the hall occupying the middle portion of the building,\r\nwith flanking wings on both sides. The building material depended upon\r\nthe locality and on the taste and means of the owner; but in this\r\ncounty brick was extensively employed by the Tudor, and still more so\r\nby the Stuart builders.\r\n\r\nIn lordly country seats, as well as in mansions of a less pretentious\r\ntype, dating from the Tudor period downward, Hertfordshire, owing\r\ndoubtless to its well-wooded and picturesque scenery, its good soil,\r\nbracing climate, and proximity to the metropolis, is especially rich,\r\nand in this respect presents a marked contrast to the neighbouring\r\ncounty of Essex. The majority of these houses, however, have been\r\neither completely rebuilt or more or less extensively altered at later\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hatfield House, South Front]\r\n\r\nAmong the few of these noble residences that can be mentioned here,\r\nHatfield House, which was built between the years 1605 and 1611 by\r\nthe first Earl of Salisbury, presents a magnificent specimen of\r\nearly Jacobean architecture in brick and stone, mellowed by time to\r\nexquisitely soft tints. The original palace, where Edward VI lived,\r\nand where Elizabeth was kept in captivity, now forms the stables.\r\nThe mention of the virgin queen naturally leads on to Ashridge, near\r\nBerkhampstead, formerly the seat of the Dukes of Bridgewater, where\r\nElizabeth also spent a considerable time in her early days. Although\r\nthe present building, which stands partly in Hertfordshire and partly\r\nin Buckinghamshire, is mostly modern Gothic, the fine vaulted cellar\r\nis a remnant of the old monastery and college which formerly occupied\r\nthe site. Knebworth, near Stevenage, the home of the Earls of Lytton,\r\nalthough now a comparatively modern Gothic building, was originally\r\na Tudor mansion, dating from the reign of Henry VII, the present\r\nhouse occupying the position of one of the four wings of the original\r\nbuilding. Tittenhanger, between St Albans and Colney, occupies the\r\nsite of a royal residence dating from the fourteenth and early part of\r\nthe fifteenth century; the present mansion, notable for its grand oak\r\nstaircase, is stated to have been built in 1654, although the style of\r\nthe brickwork suggests the early part of the eighteenth century. Little\r\nHadham Hall, at the village of that name, is a splendid example of\r\nElizabethan architecture in red brick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Knebworth]\r\n\r\nA very interesting mansion is Salisbury House, Shenley, built some time\r\nbefore 1669; much of the original brick building still remaining as\r\nan excellent example of Stuart architecture. The house is surrounded\r\nby a broad moat, and is approached by a bridge. Mackery End, near\r\nWheathampstead, contains some fine examples of sixteenth century\r\narchitecture; and Rothamsted, near Harpenden, is in the main a\r\nseventeenth century brick mansion, dating from between 1630 and 1650,\r\nalthough it has older portions, and the hall belonged to a house\r\nconstructed of timber on a flint base.\r\n\r\nOf fine old houses now forming farm-homesteads there are many examples\r\non the western side of the county. Among these is Turner’s Hall, to the\r\nnorth-west of Harpenden, now considerably modernised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water End Farm near Wheathampstead\r\n\r\n(_Elizabethan Manor-House_)]\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting building of this type is Water End Farm, in\r\nthe parish of Sandridge, situated on the banks of the Lea about two\r\nmiles from Wheathampstead, and stated to have been built about 1610.\r\nIt is constructed of brick and has the straight-gabled, mullioned\r\nstyle characteristic of the later part of the reign of Elizabeth\r\nand the commencement of that of James I. Like many other houses of\r\nElizabethan times it is constructed in the form of the letter E, and\r\nits three stacks of brick chimneys, with octagonal shafts and moulded\r\nbrick caps and bases, are especially characteristic of the style of\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Christ’s Hospital School, Hertford]\r\n\r\nOf later date are the Marlborough Buildings, or Almshouses, St Albans,\r\nerected by Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough in 1736, and affording a fine\r\nexample of the brick architecture of that period in an excellent state\r\nof preservation. Here also may be mentioned the Blue-Coat School at\r\nHertford, and the Boys’ Grammar School at Hitchin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grammar School, Hitchin]\r\n\r\nForty years ago the county abounded in picturesque brick-and-timber\r\ncottages, roofed with either tiles or thatch; but these are\r\ndisappearing yearly under the hand of the speculative builder, to\r\nbe replaced by hideous box-like buildings of brick and slate. Some,\r\nhowever, still survive, either in the towns or the smaller hamlets,\r\nsuch as picturesque Amswell, near Wheathampstead, which may be cited as\r\nan ideal example of one of the smaller Hertfordshire villages.\r\n\r\nAs has been well remarked in another volume of the present series, the\r\ngreat difference between these ancient cottages and houses and the\r\ngreat majority of their modern successors is that while the former\r\nharmonise with their surroundings, reflect not a little of the spirit\r\nof the builder, and improve, like good wine, with age, the latter are\r\naltogether out of keeping, and are likely to become, if possible, still\r\nmore offensive and objectionable with the advance of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Old Malting House, Baldock]\r\n\r\nWhile most of the old Hertfordshire cottages were of brick and timber,\r\nothers were built of flint with brick facings, or more rarely of\r\nrounded pebbles from the Woolwich and Reading beds, or with brick\r\ncourses and window-mullions; some were of feather-edge boarding, and\r\nothers again of rubble and plaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chequer’s Yard, Watford]\r\n\r\nIn Hemel Hempstead High Street is a building, now converted into\r\ncottages, which contains above the fireplaces on the ground and first\r\nfloors the Tudor rose and fleur-de-lys in plaster-work; while the back\r\nof a neighbouring building probably dates from the time of Henry VIII.\r\nExcellent examples of the old brick-and-timber cottages are to be seen\r\nin the village of Northchurch, and also at Aldbury, east of Tring,\r\nwhere the old parish stocks are likewise preserved. Most of these\r\nAldbury cottages are tiled, although a few are covered with thatch, a\r\nstyle of roofing much less common in that district than in many parts\r\nof the county. Watford has still a number of old cottages, notably\r\nin Farthing Lane and Chequer’s Yard, and in St Albans, especially in\r\nthe market-place and French Row, there are several dating from the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There is also a very remarkable\r\nold hexagonal wooden house near the ford across the Ver at St Michael’s\r\nsilk-mills, said to be one of the oldest licensed houses in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Fighting Cocks,” St Albans\r\n\r\n(_Ancient Inn near the Ford across the Ver_)]\r\n\r\nDid space permit, reference might be made to old houses in Hertford,\r\nBerkhampstead, and other towns and villages, but the facts mentioned\r\nare sufficient to indicate the interest of the county to antiquarians\r\nin the matter of ancient buildings, and before concluding this\r\nsection we must not omit to mention what is certainly not the least\r\ninteresting of all Hertfordshire antiquities--the Cross at Waltham\r\nwhich Edward erected to his beloved Queen Eleanor; the last before\r\narriving in London of the fifteen commemorating the resting-place of\r\nher body on its journey from Grantham to Westminster Abbey in 1290.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Waltham Cross]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Communications--Past and Present. Roads, Railways, Canals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLying as it does on the direct route from the metropolis to the north\r\nand north-west of England, and containing in its western portion\r\nthe formerly important city of Verulam, Hertfordshire, as might\r\nbe expected, is traversed by several trunk roads leading in those\r\ndirections, two of which date from Roman times. What these lines of\r\ncommunication were in pre-Roman days we have no means of knowing,\r\nalthough it is probable that they were little more than rude tracks\r\nthrough the great forest, or “weald,” which in those days extended some\r\nforty miles to the north of London, and afforded shelter to the great\r\nwild ox, red deer, wild boars, bears, and wolves. Road-making was a\r\nspecial attribute of the ancient Romans; and after they had constructed\r\nhighways from their early stations in Kent, they probably set to work\r\non those in the counties to the northward of London. So well made and\r\nso straight were these ancient Roman roads that many of them (with in\r\nsome cases a certain amount of local deviation) have remained the main\r\nhighways of the country down to the present day. Immediately before\r\nthe introduction of railways, when the coaching traffic was brought\r\nto its highest pitch of development, these main trunk roads--thanks to\r\nthe invention of Macadam--were maintained in superb condition, though\r\nwith the extension of the railway system some of them were allowed to\r\ndeteriorate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ermine Street at Hertford Heath]\r\n\r\nThere are three great Roman roads traversing Hertfordshire--Watling\r\nStreet, the Icknield Way, and Ermine Street. Watling Street starts\r\nfrom Dover, and after passing through London, enters the county to the\r\nsouth of Elstree, whence it is continued through Colney Street, Park\r\nStreet and St Stephens to St Albans, and thence on through Redbourn\r\nand Markyate Street, and so to Dunstable whence it eventually reached\r\nChester and Holyhead. Although frequently miscalled the North Road,\r\nthe modern representative of Watling Street is known as the Chester and\r\nHolyhead road. Originally the Roman road in the neighbourhood of St\r\nAlbans ran altogether to the west of the Ver, from Gorham Block to the\r\nPondyards; this section of the modern road, which crosses the river to\r\nenter the city, having been constructed during the years 1826–1834.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Icknield Way, showing a Ford between Ickleford and\r\nWilbury Hill]\r\n\r\nThe Icknield Way (taking its name apparently from the British tribe of\r\nthe Iceni) may be the oldest of the three great tracks, and originally\r\nof pre-Roman age, as, like the Pilgrims’ Way in Kent, it mainly follows\r\nthe line of the chalk downs. It may be called a cross-country road\r\nfrom the west of England, cutting the Watling Street at Dunstable, and\r\nthence extending in a north-easterly direction across Hertfordshire\r\nthrough Little Offley, Ickleford, and Baldock, and thence by way of\r\nRoyston, where it crosses the Ermine Street, to Newmarket and Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe Ermine Street, the third great Roman road, takes, on the other\r\nhand, a northern direction, passing through Cheshunt, Wormley,\r\nBroxbourne, and Wadesmill, and so by way of Buntingford to Royston.\r\nThere is however some difference of opinion about its course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: High Street, Stevenage]\r\n\r\nOf modern roads, the Chester and Holyhead road has been already\r\nmentioned as following in the main the line of the Old Watling\r\nStreet. Of equal importance is the Great North Road to York, passing\r\nthrough Barnet, Hatfield, Welwyn, Codicote, Stevenage, and Hitchin.\r\nOf other highways it must suffice to mention that the Bedford road\r\nbranches off from the Chester and Holyhead at St Albans to run through\r\nHarpenden, and so on to Luton, in Bedfordshire; while the main road\r\nfrom London to Cambridge and Norwich takes the line of the Lea valley\r\non the eastern side of the county, which it leaves a short distance to\r\nthe northward of Bishop’s Stortford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View on the ‘Great North Road,’ Codicote Village]\r\n\r\nIn coaching days St Albans was a far more bustling and busy town than\r\nit is at the present day; a very large number of coaches passing daily\r\nthrough the city each way, the majority running on the Holyhead and\r\nChester road, but a certain number taking the Bedford line. The two\r\nchief coaching and posting inns were the Peahen and the White Hart,\r\nboth of which are still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe speed and smartness with which the mail-coaches were run in\r\nthe days immediately preceding their abolition was little short of\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Watford]\r\n\r\nThe first half of the nineteenth century saw the introduction\r\nof railways, which gradually but surely killed the old coaching\r\ntraffic. One of the first lines to be opened was the London and\r\nNorth-Western--in 1838--which traverses the south-western side of\r\nthe county, passing through Watford, Boxmoor, Berkhampstead, and the\r\noutskirts of Tring. In 1853 a branch line was opened from Watford\r\nto St Albans, and another to Rickmansworth in 1862. With a short\r\nbreak between Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead, the North-Western system\r\nis connected with the Midland by means of a branch line from the\r\nlast-named town to Harpenden. The main line of the Midland, which\r\ntraverses the western half of the county by way of Elstree, St Albans,\r\nand Harpenden, was opened in 1868. Both St Albans and Harpenden\r\nhave branches of the Great Northern Railway to Hatfield, which is\r\non the main line; the latter continuing through Welwyn, Stevenage,\r\nand Hitchin. By means of a branch line of the Great Northern from\r\nHatfield to Hertford, we reach the Great Eastern, the fourth great\r\nrailway in the county, the main line of which runs through Broxbourne,\r\nSawbridgeworth, and Bishop’s Stortford, but connected also with Ware\r\nand Hertford, and having a branch from St Margaret’s to Buntingford.\r\n\r\nWith such a multiplicity of lines, it might well be imagined that\r\nrailway communication between nearly all parts of the county would be\r\nwell-nigh perfect. As a matter of fact, this is by no means the case;\r\nand the journey by rail from the western to the eastern side, owing to\r\nchanges and delays, is so slow and tedious, that it is frequently found\r\nconvenient to hold important Hertfordshire meetings, like those of the\r\nCounty Council, in London.\r\n\r\nAs regards water-communication, the western side of the county is\r\nserved by the Grand Junction Canal, which, after leaving Leighton\r\nBuzzard, enters the county near Tring, and thence runs by way of\r\nBerkhampstead, Boxmoor, Hemel Hempstead, Runton Bridge, Watford and\r\nRickmansworth in a south-easterly and southerly direction to London. A\r\nconsiderable amount of barge-traffic is still carried on this canal,\r\nalthough nothing approaching that in pre-railway times. In those days\r\nthe whole of the coal-supply for north-western Herts came by canal\r\nto Boxmoor, whence it had to be carted for long distances--some 14\r\nmiles to Harpenden, for instance. As there are at least two very steep\r\nhills--which become impossible for heavily laden teams when the roads\r\nare slippery--between Boxmoor and Harpenden, the inhabitants of the\r\nlatter picturesque village were apt to run short of firing at Christmas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Junction Canal near Hemel Hempstead]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the county the Lea is navigable for barges as far\r\nup as Ware and Hertford; and here too a considerable amount of heavy\r\ntraffic is still carried on by water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Haileybury College]\r\n\r\nIn this place mention may conveniently be made of the New River,\r\nrunning from the valley of the Lea near the Rye House, at a gradually\r\nincreasing distance from that river, to the metropolis. The New River,\r\nor Middleton’s Waters, as it used also to be called, was constructed in\r\nthe reign of James I, at first almost entirely by Sir Hugh Middleton,\r\nbut later on by a company with a special charter, for the purpose of\r\nsupplying north London with drinking-water. The chief sources of the\r\nNew River are the springs at Chadwell and Amwell. At the present time\r\nan original £100 share in the New River Company is worth an almost\r\nfabulous price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Administration and Divisions--Ancient and Modern.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present administration and administrative divisions of\r\nHertfordshire, like those of other English counties, have been\r\ngradually evolved and developed from those of our Saxon forefathers;\r\neach alteration in the form of local government and of local\r\nadministrative boundaries being based on the previously existing\r\nsystem. By the Saxons each county was divided into a number of\r\nmain divisions known as hundreds, or wapentakes, each governed\r\nby a hundreder, or centenary (the equivalent of the Old German\r\n_Zentgrafen_), and each having a name of its own. Hertfordshire is\r\nnow divided into eight hundreds, the names of which, commencing on\r\nthe western side of the county, are as follows: Dacorum (including\r\nTring), Cassio (with the important towns of St Albans, Watford, and\r\nRickmansworth), Hertford, Braughing, Broadwater (occupying nearly\r\nthe centre), Hitchin and Pirton (on the north-west corner), Odsey (in\r\nthe extreme north), and Edwinstree (on the north-east). Originally\r\nthey were more numerous, Cassio, for instance, being much smaller\r\nthan at present, while the Hitchin division was reckoned only as a\r\nhalf-hundred. The origin of the names of most of the hundreds are\r\nself-apparent; but that of Cassio (originally Kayso) appears to be\r\nunknown, while that of Dacorum has some connection with the Danes,\r\nperhaps referring to a Danish settlement.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable facts connected with the hundreds of\r\nHertfordshire is that three of them do not lie within what farmers call\r\na ring-fence. Dacorum, for instance, has two outlying areas in the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of Cassio, and a third wedged in between Cassio on\r\nthe west, Broadwater on the north, and an outlying portion of Cassio\r\non the east. Broadwater, again, has a small outlier on the Middlesex\r\nborder of the south-eastern “peninsula” of Cassio; while Cassio itself,\r\ninclusive of the one already mentioned, has no less than eight of these\r\ncurious outliers, one situated in the extreme north in the hundred of\r\nOdsey.\r\n\r\nEach hundred originally had its own court, or “hundred-mote,” which\r\nmet monthly; and it was divided, as at present, into townships, or\r\nparishes. The parish, in turn, had its own council, or _gemot_, where\r\nevery freeman had a right to appear. This assembly or council made its\r\nown local by-laws, to enforce which it had a reeve, a bailiff, and a\r\ntithingman, with the powers of a constable. The reeve was chairman of\r\nthe township _gemot_, and could summon that assembly at pleasure.\r\n\r\nPassing on to more modern times, we find Hertfordshire occupying a\r\npeculiar position in regard to local government and administration in\r\nthat it possessed a kind of _imperium in imperio_ in the shape of what\r\nwas known as the Liberty of St Alban; in other words, a large area\r\non the western side of the county originally under the jurisdiction\r\nof the abbots of St Albans, who had the power of inflicting the\r\ndeath-penalty. Originally there was a separate Commission of the Peace\r\nfor the Liberty, so that a Justice for the County had no jurisdiction\r\nin the former unless he had been specially inducted. This arrangement\r\nwas found, however, to be inconvenient, and the Liberty, as such, was\r\nabolished, although it was taken as a basis for the splitting of the\r\ncounty into a western and an eastern division for judicial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe chief officers of the county are the Lord Lieutenant and the High\r\nSheriff; the former (who in Hertfordshire is always a nobleman) being\r\nthe direct local representative of the sovereign, and having the\r\nappointment of magistrates and the officers of the territorial forces,\r\nwhile the latter (who is a commoner) is the head of the executive\r\ndepartment in the administration of justice. The Lord Lieutenant holds\r\noffice for life, or during the sovereign’s pleasure, but the Sheriff\r\nis appointed annually by the Crown. Deputy Lieutenants are supposed to\r\nact, in case of need, for the Lord Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nFormerly the greater part of the business of the county was conducted\r\nby the Justices of the Peace, or Magistrates, at Quarter Sessions,\r\nbut most of this is now transferred to the County Council, which, as\r\npreviously stated, often meets in London. This County Council, which\r\nwas first established in 1888, is composed of Aldermen and Councillors;\r\nthe latter of whom are elected, while the former are what is called\r\n“co-opted,” that is to say, selected by the Council itself, either\r\nfrom its own body, or from the general public. The duties of the\r\nCounty Council include the maintenance of high roads and bridges; the\r\nappointment and control, in conjunction with the magistrates, of the\r\npolice; the management of reformatories and lunatic asylums; and, in a\r\nword, the general carrying out of the laws enacted by Parliament.\r\n\r\nAccording to a scheme elaborated in an Act of Parliament passed in\r\n1894, the more important minor local bodies are denominated District\r\nCouncils, and those whose function is less Parish Councils; the former\r\nhaving control of the more populous towns and villages, other than\r\ncities and boroughs, and the latter those with fewer inhabitants. For\r\nthis purpose many parishes are divided into a more populous Urban and\r\na less populous Rural District. Certain towns in the county rank,\r\nhowever, as cities, or boroughs, and have larger powers and different\r\nforms of government; being ruled by a Mayor and Corporation, and having\r\nmagistrates and a police force distinct from those of the county. Among\r\nthese privileged towns, St Albans ranks as a city, while Hertford\r\nand Hemel Hempstead are boroughs. Hemel Hempstead is a very ancient\r\nborough, and has, in addition to its Mayor, an official known as the\r\nHigh Bailiff.\r\n\r\nThe county is likewise divided into a number of Poor Law Unions, each\r\nwith a Board of Guardians, whose duty it is to manage the workhouses,\r\nand appoint officers to carry out the work of relieving the poor and\r\nthose incapacitated by age or other cause from earning their own living.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Shire Hall, Hertford]\r\n\r\nAs regards the administration of justice, Assizes are held by His\r\nMajesty’s Judges three or four times a year at the Shire Hall,\r\nHertford, for the whole county; the Grand Jury on such occasions being\r\ncomposed entirely, or mainly, of magistrates. Quarter Sessions, on the\r\nother hand, are held four times a year at Hertford for the eastern, and\r\nat the Court House, St Albans, for the western division of the county;\r\nthese courts being constituted by the magistrates for the county and\r\nthe mayors of the boroughs and city. Petty Sessions are held weekly,\r\nfortnightly, or monthly at a number of the towns and larger villages.\r\nIn most cases the county magistrates in the immediate neighbourhood\r\npreside at these sessions; but the city of St Albans and the two\r\nboroughs have magistrates of their own, who also hold petty sessions\r\nfor trying cases which occur within the area of their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSt Albans is the centre of an episcopal diocese, which includes\r\nmost of that portion of London situated within the county of Essex.\r\nArrangements are, however, now in progress for relieving the Bishop of\r\nSt Albans of the care of that part of the diocese commonly known as\r\n“London Over the Border.”\r\n\r\nThe diocese, so far as Hertfordshire is concerned, is divided into\r\narchdeaconries, rural deaneries, and parishes. The latter are very\r\nnumerous, although somewhat less so than the civil parishes, for the\r\npurposes of which, as already mentioned, the ecclesiastical parishes\r\nare frequently split into an urban and a rural section. There are\r\n170 ecclesiastical parishes situated wholly or partly within the old\r\ncounty, of which 164 are included in the diocese of St Albans; while\r\nthree belong to Ely, two to Oxford, and part of one (Northwood) to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe larger towns, the city, and the two boroughs have Education\r\nCommittees of their own; but for the rest of the county a Committee of\r\nthis nature is appointed by the County Council.\r\n\r\nHertfordshire has four parliamentary divisions, namely, Hertford,\r\nHitchin, St Albans, and Watford, each of which returns one member to\r\nthe House of Commons. The county is thus represented only by four\r\nmembers, as against fifteen for Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. The Roll of Honour of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\nHertfordshire cannot hope to rival such counties as Norfolk or Kent in\r\nits roll of distinguished names, but it can show a fairly long list of\r\npersons connected with the county who have been famous.\r\n\r\nSince reference has already been made in several of the foregoing\r\nsections to the visits of English sovereigns to the county, or to their\r\nresidence within its borders, very brief mention of the connection\r\nbetween royalty and the county will suffice in this place. Neither here\r\nnor elsewhere in these pages is any attempt made to give a complete\r\nlist of such visits.\r\n\r\nThe names of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, and of Offa, king of\r\nMercia, who had his palace at Offley, dying there in 796, will always\r\nbe specially connected with Hertfordshire. In a somewhat less degree\r\nthe same may be said of William the Conqueror, to whom, as already\r\nmentioned, the crown of this realm was offered at Berkhampstead. Edward\r\nII and Edward III frequently resided at Langley Palace, where Edmund de\r\nLangley, the founder of the White Rose faction, was born in 1341; and\r\nthe same residence was also used by Richard II. Henry I and his consort\r\nMatilda were present at the dedication of St Albans’ Abbey on its\r\ncompletion by Abbot Paul; and Henry VI was at the first battle of St\r\nAlbans, where he was wounded. Henry VIII, as mentioned on page 82, was\r\nstill more intimately connected with Hertfordshire, and the manor of\r\nHitchin was conferred by him in turn on Anne Boleyn and her successors.\r\nReference has already been made to the residence of Queen Mary, in her\r\nyouth, at Ashridge, and of Queen Elizabeth (before her ascent to the\r\nthrone) both there and at Hatfield; while, as sovereign, Elizabeth\r\nalso visited St Albans on two or three occasions as the guest of Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon at Gorhambury, and also went to other great houses in\r\nthe county. James I, as mentioned on the same page, spent much time\r\nat Royston, and died at Theobalds. The Rye House plot, so called from\r\nthe meeting-place of the conspirators at Broxbourne, as stated in an\r\nearlier section, was devised for the purpose of assassinating Charles\r\nII while on his way through the county.\r\n\r\nIn connection with personages of royal blood, mention may be made of\r\nHumphry, Duke of Gloucester, whose name is so intimately associated\r\nwith St Albans’ Abbey, to the monastery of which he was admitted a\r\nmember in 1423; and also of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who was\r\nborn at Sandridge in the eighteenth century, and built and endowed the\r\nalmshouses bearing her name in St Albans.\r\n\r\nAmong great statesmen connected with the county a prominent place must\r\nbe assigned to Queen Elizabeth’s councillors and favourites, Lord\r\nBurleigh and the Earl of Essex. To her reign likewise belongs Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, Keeper of the Great Seal, and owner of Gorhambury,\r\nwhere he died in 1578. Nearly a century later (1652), Gorhambury came\r\ninto the possession of Sir Harbottle Grimston, well known as Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Salisbury Statue, Hatfield]\r\n\r\nPassing on to the Victorian age, we have two great statesmen, namely,\r\nLord Melbourne and Lord Palmerston, both of whom lived at Brocket,\r\nwhere the former died; and, subsequently, the late Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, owner of stately Hatfield. The first Viscount Hampden,\r\nsometime Speaker of the House of Commons, was also a Hertfordshire man,\r\nwith his residence at Kimpton Hoo. Cecil Rhodes, the South African\r\npremier and “Empire-builder,” likewise claims a place in the roll of\r\nhonour of the county, having been born at Bishop’s Stortford rectory,\r\nand Commodore Anson, the great circumnavigator, though not a native,\r\nlived at Moor Park, where he died in 1762.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cecil Rhodes’s Birth-place, Bishop’s Stortford]\r\n\r\nDame Juliana Berners, imaginary prioress of Sopwell nunnery, who was\r\nsupposed to have written the immortal _Treatyse on Fysshynge with\r\nan Angle_, the first work on angling ever published in England, has\r\nbeen shown to be a myth. Among names famous in literature and science\r\nthe greatest connected with the county is perhaps that of the great\r\nphilosopher Sir Francis Bacon, afterwards Lord Verulam and Viscount\r\nSt Albans, who, during his father’s residence at Gorhambury, lived\r\nin Verulam House, at the Pondyards. On the death of his father Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon he succeeded to Gorhambury. By a curious error he is\r\nfrequently called Lord Bacon, although no such title was ever in\r\nexistence. John Bunyan claims a place among Hertfordshire literary\r\nworthies as he was connected with a chapel at Hitchin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins of Verulam House, the Residence of Francis,\r\nViscount St Albans]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis Bacon, Viscount St Albans]\r\n\r\nTwo of the greatest literary names connected with the county are those\r\nof William Cowper the poet, and Charles Lamb, author of the _Essays of\r\nElia_, unsurpassed as a master of delicately humorous prose, whether as\r\nessayist or letter-writer. The former was born at Berkhampstead rectory\r\nin the year 1731; but Lamb was chiefly a visitor to the county, though,\r\nas he tells us in the _Essays_, he was once a Hertfordshire landowner,\r\nand his cottage at West Hill Green, about 2½ miles from Puckeridge,\r\nstill exists. Mackery End Farm was the residence of the Brutons, who\r\nwere his relatives, and it was to their house that his visits were\r\nmade; so that the neighbourhood is essentially Lamb’s country. It is a\r\nquestion whether the Lyttons or the beauties of Knebworth, their home,\r\nare the more famous. The great novelist, author of _The Last Days of\r\nPompeii_, _The Caxtons_, and innumerable other tales, as well as such\r\nsuccessful plays as _The Lady of Lyons_ and _Money_, was best known to\r\nreaders in the middle of the last century as Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton,\r\nthough he began life as Mr Bulwer and died Lord Lytton. His son, poet,\r\nAmbassador, and Viceroy, who wrote under the name of “Owen Meredith,”\r\nwas scarcely less distinguished, and received an Earldom in 1880. Here,\r\ntoo, mention may be made of Mrs Thrale, the friend of Dr Johnson, who\r\nwas often at Offley Place, where her husband, whose family was long\r\nconnected with St Albans, was born. Offley Place was at this time a\r\nfine old Elizabethan mansion, although it has since been rebuilt.\r\nGadebridge Park, Hemel Hempstead, was the residence of the great\r\nsurgeon Sir Astley Paston Cooper. But a greater distinction attaches to\r\nthe name of Rothamsted, near Harpenden, as being the residence of the\r\nlate Sir John Bennet Lawes, Bart., who, with his scientific colleague\r\nSir Henry Gilbert, conducted the experiments which made their names\r\nfamous throughout the agricultural world. Sir John Lawes first obtained\r\nthe idea of using fossilised phosphates for manure from Professor\r\nHenslow, the great Cambridge botanist (himself sometime a resident\r\nat Hall Place, St Albans), who sent him specimens obtained from the\r\nEssex “Crag,” with a suggestion that they might be used as a source\r\nof phosphoric acid. Yarrell, the naturalist, lies buried in Bayford\r\nchurchyard, with many members of his family. Last in the scientific\r\nand literary list, we have the name of Sir John Evans, the great\r\nantiquarian and numismatist of Nash Mills, Hemel Hempstead, who died so\r\nrecently as 1908. To Evans, in conjunction with the late Sir Joseph\r\nPrestwich, is mainly due the credit of definitely establishing the fact\r\nthat the so-called flint “celts” are really the work of prehistoric\r\nman. His most important and best work is _Ancient Stone Implements_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Lamb]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Cowper]\r\n\r\nAmong great ecclesiastics mention must be made of Nicholas Breakspear,\r\nborn near Abbot’s Langley towards the close of the eleventh century,\r\nwho subsequently became Pope as Adrian IV; being the only Englishman\r\nwho has occupied the papal chair. Reference may also be made to\r\nCardinal Wolsey, who spent a considerable portion of his time at\r\nDelamere House. Nor must we omit Young, the author of the _Night\r\nThoughts_ and Rector of Welwyn, or that great maker of hymns, Dr Watts,\r\nwho as the 36-year guest of Sir Thomas Abney resided at Theobalds,\r\nwhere he died. Among distinguished lawyers, the most prominent name\r\nis that of Lord Grimthorpe (formerly Sir Edmund Beckett), who was,\r\nhowever, connected with the county, not in his professional capacity,\r\nbut as the restorer of St Albans’ Abbey and other churches in the\r\nneighbourhood. Much criticism has been expended on Lord Grimthorpe’s\r\nmodes of “restoration,” which were certainly of a drastic character. It\r\nmust, however, be remembered that when he undertook the restoration of\r\nSt Albans’ Abbey it was in a dangerous condition, and sufficient money\r\nwas not forthcoming to make it secure. The result is that the abbey,\r\nalthough in many ways unlike its former self, will stand for centuries.\r\nLord Grimthorpe, who was a Yorkshireman, built himself a residence at\r\nBatchwood, near St Albans.\r\n\r\nAs another well-known lawyer and also a judge, mention may be made of\r\nLord Brampton (Sir Henry Hawkins), who came of a family long connected\r\nwith Hitchin, at which town he was born.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Chauncy, the antiquary and historian of the county, to whom\r\nreference has so often been made in this book, lived, and died in 1700,\r\nat Yardley; and Balfe, the composer, made his home at Rowney Abbey,\r\nclose by, till his death in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. THE CHIEF TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF HERTFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\n(The figures in brackets after each name give the population in 1901,\r\n    and those at the end of the sections give the references to the\r\n    text.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbot’s Langley (3342), a village situated on the Gade, with a station\r\non the North-Western Railway; it was bestowed in the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor upon the then abbot of St Albans, whence its name. Hunton\r\nMill, on the Gade, was granted to Sir Richard Lee in 1544, and both\r\nthis and Nash Mills were farmed from the abbot of St Albans between\r\n1349 and 1396. The present church, dedicated to St Lawrence, cannot be\r\ntraced farther back than the close of the twelfth century. A west tower\r\nwas added about 1200. (pp. 72, 90, 105, 149.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAldenham (2437), a village and manor lying to the north-east of\r\nWatford. It has a grammar school; and near by is Aldenham Abbey, the\r\nseat of Lord Aldenham. In 1898 two Roman kilns were discovered in\r\nthe parish. The church, which has been restored, contains one small\r\ntwelfth-century window; no trace of the chancel remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amwells--Great Amwell (1421), and Little Amwell (930)--small\r\nvillages not far from the Rye House. Amwell is associated with the name\r\nof the Quaker poet, John Scott, who lived there for some time after\r\n1740. Near by is Haileybury, formerly the training college for the\r\nofficials of the East India Company, but now a public school. (p. 135.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAshridge, a domain in Little Gaddesden parish, situated on the\r\nBuckinghamshire border of the county, and celebrated for its splendid\r\nbeech woods. It was formerly the property of the Dukes of Bridgewater,\r\nbeing acquired by the Egertons in 1604, but it is now owned by Earl\r\nBrownlow. A building, formerly the porter’s lodge, includes some\r\nremains of an old monastic college. The present house, which stands\r\npartly in Buckinghamshire, was built by the eighth Earl of Bridgewater.\r\n(pp. 115, 142.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAshwell (1281), a village on the Cambridgeshire border of the county,\r\nwith a station some distance away on the Royston and Cambridge branch\r\nof the Great Northern Railway. Ashwell, which was formerly a town,\r\nhad a fair and a market in the time of William the Conqueror. It was\r\nseverely visited by the plague. Its church-tower is the only one in the\r\ncounty built wholly of stone. (pp. 92, 113.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBaldock (2057) is a market-town on the Icknield Way, to the north-west\r\nof Hitchin, with a station on the above-mentioned branch of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway. It dates from Norman times, when it was known as\r\nBaudok. During the Crusades, Baldock, like St Albans, Berkhampstead,\r\nand Hoddesdon, had a lazar-house for lepers, who were at that time\r\nnumerous all over England. The list of Rectors is complete from the\r\ndays of the Knights Hospitallers in 1317. The church contains much\r\nDecorated and Perpendicular work. (pp. 90, 94, 128.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBarkway (661), originally Berkway, is a small town and manor situated a\r\nfew miles to the north-east of Buntingford. (p. 96.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBarnet, or Chipping Barnet, originally Chipping Bernet (7876), a large\r\nand important market-town near the Middlesex border of the county, with\r\na station (High Barnet) on a branch of the Great Northern Railway. Near\r\nby are New Barnet and East Barnet, with a station on the main line, and\r\nhaving a population of 10,024. The name Barnet is a corruption of the\r\nSaxon _Bergnet_, signifying a little hill; the site of the town then\r\nforming a small rising in the midst of the great forest; the prefix\r\nChipping = market is a word of Scandinavian origin, represented in the\r\nSwedish Jonköping and the Danish Kjøbenhavn = (Copenhagen). Barnet\r\nwas the scene of a battle in 1471, when the Yorkists defeated the\r\nLancastrians, killing their leader, Warwick the king-maker. The market\r\nwas famous for its cattle; and in addition to this there is an annual\r\nhorse-fair, which formerly attracted dealers from all parts of the\r\ncountry. (pp. 9, 53, 54, 82, 99, 128.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Barnet (2867), known as La Barnette in the thirteenth century, and\r\nLow Barnet in the fifteenth century, is situated on the stream known as\r\nPymmes’ Brook, on the western side of the valley of which stands the\r\nalmost deserted old parish church.\r\n\r\n\r\nBayford (330), a village nearly midway between Hatfield and Hoddesdon.\r\nIn the churchyard is buried William Yarrell the naturalist. Bayfordbury\r\nis celebrated for its collection of portraits of members of the Kitcat\r\nClub painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller. (p. 147.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBengeo (3063), formerly Bengehoo, a village in the valley of the Beane\r\none mile north of Hertford. The old church, now little used, is one\r\nof the oldest in the county, dating apparently from the early Norman\r\nperiod. Together with Great Wymondley church, it is peculiar, so far as\r\nHertfordshire is concerned, in having an apsidal chancel. In place of a\r\ntower, it has a wooden bell-cote. Panshanger, formerly the property of\r\nthe late Lord Cowper, is near by.\r\n\r\n\r\nBennington (522), a market-town and manor, situated on the Beane,\r\nfrom which it takes its name; it was an important place in the ninth\r\ncentury, when it was the residence of the kings of Mercia. The church\r\nis fourteenth century. (pp. 53, 54, 56, 78, 111.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBerkhampstead, or Berkhampstead Magna (5140), an important\r\nmarket-town[3] on the London and North-Western Railway and Grand\r\nJunction Canal, and one of the oldest in the county, the castle dating\r\nfrom Norman times, and being possibly on the site of an earlier\r\nSaxon edifice. It was here that the crown of England was offered to\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. The manor and castle were granted first to\r\nPiers Gaveston and subsequently to Edward the Black Prince, but were\r\nafterwards annexed to the Duchy of Cornwall. Berkhampstead, which\r\nis now a petty-sessions town, and has an ancient grammar school,\r\nformerly returned burgesses to Parliament. Its almshouses were built\r\nin 1684. Cowper was born here. Berkhampstead Parva and Berkhampstead\r\nSt Mary’s--the latter now generally known as Northchurch--are villages\r\nin the neighbourhood. The church dates from the thirteenth century; it\r\ncontains the beautiful Torrington tomb. (pp. 2, 7, 63, 80, 81, 82, 91,\r\n92, 109, 111, 131, 132, 141.)\r\n\r\n[3] The market at Berkhampstead has been discontinued for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop’s Stortford (7143) is the most important town on the Essex\r\nborder of the county, and has a station on the main line of the Great\r\nEastern Railway, and a bridge over the Stort. The town, which has a\r\nmarket, possessed a considerable trade in Saxon times, and was the\r\nproperty of the Bishop of London, and to protect this, and for the\r\npurpose of consolidating his own rights, William the Conqueror built\r\na small castle here. Bishop’s Stortford has a grammar school, and\r\nformerly returned members to Parliament. The church, which dates from\r\nthe tenth century, is an imposing Perpendicular edifice, and stands on\r\nthe site of an earlier building. (pp. 23, 24, 79, 92, 112, 132, 144.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bishop’s Stortford, and the River Stort]\r\n\r\n\r\nBoxmoor (1127), a small town on the Grand Junction Canal and North\r\nWestern Railway. A Roman villa was discovered here some years ago. (pp.\r\n132, 133.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBraughing (930), a village to the north-west of Stortford, on the\r\nCambridge road, with a station on the Great Eastern Railway, situated\r\nin the valley of the Quin. It dates from Saxon times, when it was\r\nknown as Brooking; and it was granted a market by Stephen. A Roman\r\nsarcophagus and many Roman coins have been discovered in the parish.\r\n(pp. 22, 113, 136.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBroxbourne (748) is also a village on the Great Eastern Railway, to the\r\nsouth of Hoddesdon: it contains an almshouse for poor widows founded in\r\nthe year 1728. The village is intimately connected with the Rye House\r\nPlot. (pp. 128, 142.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBuntingford (1272) is a market-town, with almshouses, on a branch of\r\nthe Great Eastern Railway running northwards from Stortford. It was\r\ngranted a market by Edward III. (pp. 54, 128.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBushey (2838), a parish in the south of the county, separated from\r\nWatford about 1166. The village is now the site of the Herkomer Art\r\nSchool. The church was “restored” in 1871, when a late Gothic window\r\nwas removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBygrave (148), a small market-town a short distance north-east of\r\nBaldock.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassiobury, a park and mansion at the north-west of Watford which has\r\nfor many generations been the residence of the Earls of Essex. The\r\npresent house is modern. (pp. 20, 21, 45, 84, 85, 136.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheshunt (12,292) is a large market-town in the south-eastern corner\r\nof the county, nearly north-west of Waltham Abbey, with a station\r\non the Great Eastern and some distance from the town itself. It is\r\ncelebrated for its nursery gardens, roses being especially cultivated.\r\nWithin Cheshunt parish is situated Theobald’s Park, at one time a royal\r\nresidence. Cheshunt Park is on the opposite, or north side of the town;\r\nand near by are the remains of an old nunnery. (pp. 43, 99, 100, 128.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCodicote (1145), a small village to the north-west of Welwyn. The\r\nchurch was an ancient one, but a drastic “restoration” in 1853\r\ndestroyed much of the evidence of the age of its constituent portions.\r\n(pp. 43, 128, 130.)\r\n\r\n\r\nElstree (1323), a village on the southern border of the county lying a\r\nlittle west of the Midland Railway, on which it has a station. It is\r\nrapidly becoming a suburb of London. (pp. 7, 11, 52, 126, 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFlamstead (1039), a village near the Watling Street to the north of\r\nRedbourn. The name is supposed to be a corruption of Verlampstead,\r\nthe Ver flowing in the valley below the village. The Thomas Saunders\r\nalmshouses were built in 1669. Beechwood, the seat of the Sebright\r\nfamily is in the parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Gaddesden (746), a village in Dacorum Hundred to the north\r\nof Hemel Hempstead. Gaddesden Place, which was burnt down in 1905\r\nand rebuilt, is the seat of the Halsey family, who possessed the\r\nneighbouring “Golden Parsonage” so long ago as 1544. The church\r\nprobably dates from the twelfth century. (pp. 19, 35, 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hadhams--Much Hadham (1199), Little Hadham (655)--two villages\r\nlying respectively to the south-west and north-west of Bishop\r\nStortford, and known to have been in existence in the time of the\r\nConqueror. The manor of Hadham Hall was granted by the crown to the\r\nBishops of London at the time when the survey recorded in Domesday\r\nbooks was made. (pp. 12, 117.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHarpenden (4725), a large village or small town on the Midland Railway,\r\nalmost exactly half-way between St Albans and Luton. During the last\r\ntwenty years Harpenden (“the valley of nightingales”) has nearly\r\ndoubled in size, and is rapidly increasing. Within the parish is the\r\nagricultural experiment-station of Rothamsted; the laboratory being\r\nsituated on the borders of the village itself. About a mile to the\r\nnorth is Shire-Mere, a small green partly in Hertfordshire and partly\r\nin Bedfordshire, and in consequence a favourite site for prize-fights\r\nin the old days. Harpenden has branch-lines connected with the Great\r\nNorthern and the North-Western Railways. With the exception of the more\r\nmodern tower, the church, which was largely Norman, was pulled down and\r\nrebuilt in the sixties. A Norman arch remains in the tower. (pp. 7, 36,\r\n37, 38, 43, 45, 47, 66, 67, 75, 96, 117, 130, 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHatfield, or King’s Hatfield (4330), is a small town on the main line\r\nof the Great Northern Railway, chiefly noteworthy on account of its\r\nconnection with Hatfield House, the seat of the Cecils, Marquises of\r\nSalisbury. As mentioned above, Hatfield was at one time a royal palace;\r\nbut the original building is now used as a stable and riding-school,\r\nthe present house being of Jacobean date. The residence at Hatfield of\r\nQueen Elizabeth is connected with the old palace. Among the features\r\nof Hatfield House are the marble hall, its oak-panelled walls hung\r\nwith tapestry, and its panelled ceiling painted; the grand staircase,\r\nhung with portraits; the long gallery, with its armour and pictures;\r\nKing James’s drawing-room, a magnificently decorated apartment; the\r\ngreat dining-room, with a bust of Lord Burleigh; the armoury; and\r\nthe beautiful chapel, with its exquisite Flemish window and a marble\r\naltar-piece. Hatfield is an important railway centre for the county,\r\nthe Great Northern having branches to Hertford, St Albans, and\r\nHarpenden and Luton. Petty sessions are held in the town. In the church\r\nare the monuments of the Cecil family, and a statue of the late Lord\r\nSalisbury, erected by county subscription, stands at the park entrance.\r\n(pp. 20, 23, 31, 34, 43, 83, 115, 116, 128, 132, 142.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHemel Hempstead (11,264) is an ancient borough and market-town on\r\nthe western side of the county connected with the main line of the\r\nNorth-Western Railway at Boxmoor, and also served by a branch joining\r\nthe main line of the Midland at Harpenden. In addition to a mayor,\r\nHempstead has a borough official known as the high bailiff[4]. The\r\ntown, which is situated in the Gade valley, and formerly returned\r\nmembers of its own to Parliament, is remarkable for the length of its\r\nmain street--part of which is known as Marlowes. Its market-day is\r\nThursday, and there is an annual wool-sale. Corn and cattle are its\r\nchief trade, the straw-plait industry having nearly died out; but near\r\nby is Nash Mills, the site of a large paper factory. The church, which\r\nstands to the west of the main street, is a fine example of a cruciform\r\ntwelfth-century parish church; it was commenced about 1140 and finished\r\nsome 40 years later. There is no evidence of any earlier building on\r\nthe site. (pp. 43, 47, 101, 102, 122, 131, 132, 133, 138, 147.)\r\n\r\n[4] The office of high bailiff of Hemel Hempstead is held by the mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHertford (9322), although by no means the largest town as regards\r\nthe number of its population, occupies the first place, as being the\r\ncounty-town, and the only one in Hertfordshire where assizes are held.\r\nIt is also a market-town and borough (with a mayor and corporation),\r\nand formerly returned members of its own to Parliament, although now\r\nit is only the centre of a parliamentary division of the county. In\r\naddition to the assizes for the whole county, quarter-sessions for\r\nthe eastern division of Hertfordshire are held in the Shire Hall.\r\nThe site of Hertford Castle--a building of great antiquity--is now\r\nused as the Judges’ lodgings in assize time. Hertford has branches\r\nof Christ’s Hospital, for both boys and girls; and within a short\r\ndistance is Haileybury College, now a public school, but formerly the\r\ntraining-place for the civil service of the old East India Company.\r\nHertford is served by branches of both the Great Eastern and Great\r\nNorthern Railways, and has also water communication with London by\r\nway of the Lea. It is a centre of the waning malting industry. The old\r\nchurch was burnt down some years ago. (pp. 3, 20, 31, 34, 79, 81, 84,\r\n92, 94, 111, 126, 134, 136, 138, 139, 141, 147.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The College Chapel, Haileybury]\r\n\r\n\r\nHertingfordbury (733), a village on the railway to the west of\r\nHertford, dating from Norman times. The manor of Roxford was granted by\r\nWilliam the Conqueror to Goisfrede de Beck for good service rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHexton (155), a village in a small parish of Cassio Hundred on the\r\nnorth border of the county jutting into Bedfordshire. Ancient coins\r\nhave been found in the parish, which includes the old earthwork known\r\nas Ravensburgh Castle. Hexton seems to have been granted on two\r\noccasions to the monastery of St Alban.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchin (10,072) is one of the most ancient towns in the county, and\r\nis now an important railway centre, as it is the starting point of the\r\nRoyston and Cambridge branch of the Great Northern Railway, on the\r\nmain line of which the town itself is situated. Hitchin is one of the\r\nfour parliamentary centres of the county, and is noted for its corn\r\nand cattle market, and also as being one of the few places in England\r\nwhere lavender is cultivated for commercial purposes. Hitchin preserves\r\nthe remnant of an ancient monastery in the almshouses known as the\r\nBiggin, and teems with buildings and sites of antiquarian interest.\r\nPetty sessions are held in the town. The parish church is one of great\r\nbeauty and interest, mainly of the Decorated and Perpendicular styles.\r\nA picture of the Adoration of the Magi presented in 1774 is believed to\r\nbe by Rubens. (pp. 14, 68, 69, 74, 105, 106, 108, 120, 128, 136, 141,\r\n142, 145, 149.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHoddesdon (4711), an ancient market-town on the eastern border of the\r\ncounty, approached from either the Broxbourne or Rye House stations of\r\nthe Great Eastern Railway. It is intimately connected with the story of\r\nthe Rye House Plot (see page 85). It may be mentioned here that the\r\n“great bed of Ware” is now preserved at the Rye House. (pp. 85, 86.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hormeads--Great Hormead (376), Little Hormead (128)--two villages,\r\nnear the Quin about two miles east of Buntingford, while the latter is\r\nabout half a mile south of the same. Both date from the time of the\r\nConqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nIppolits or Hippolits (840), a village in the Hundred of Hitchin,\r\ndedicated to St Hippolytus patron saint of horses. Travellers used to\r\ntake their horses to the high altar, where miracles were performed on\r\nuntamed colts.\r\n\r\n\r\nKensworth (516), a small and ancient village in Dacorum Hundred dating\r\nfrom the time of Edward the Confessor, and formerly belonging to St\r\nPaul’s Cathedral. The small church dates from about the year 1100,\r\nalthough the tower is later. (pp. 88, 90, 98.)\r\n\r\n\r\nKing’s Langley (1579), a village on the North-Western Railway notable\r\nas the site of the ancient Tudor Palace of Langley, and of a friary of\r\nwhich portions still remain. The royal palace and park date at least\r\nfrom 1299. The friary belonged to the Dominican order. (pp. 81, 82,\r\n107, 141.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLayston (983); the original village is now represented only by the\r\nruined church of St Bartholomew, situated a short distance from\r\nBuntingford, and of great antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetchworth, till recently a very small village on the Great Northern\r\nRailway a little north of Hitchin, has now sprung into importance as\r\nthe site of the “Garden City”; an endeavour to aid in bringing the\r\npopulation back to the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Letchworth, Open Air School]\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Mimms (1112), a village on the North road, situated some distance\r\nto the south-east of St Albans. A manor of North Mimms was in existence\r\nat the Conquest. The parish includes three large parks, Brookman’s,\r\nPotterells, and North Mimms. The church, which is rich in monuments,\r\ndates from the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffley (1001), or Great Offley, which lies on the Bedfordshire border\r\nof the county, between Luton and Hitchin, takes its name from Offa II,\r\nking of Mercia, who died there in his palace. The church of St Mary\r\nMagdalene is built in the Perpendicular style, with an apsidal chancel.\r\nMrs Thrale, the friend of Dr Johnson, lived as a girl at Offley Place.\r\n(pp. 14, 105, 128, 141, 147.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRedbourn (1932), a village on the Chester and Holyhead road, in the\r\nvalley of the Ver, about four miles north-west of St Albans; it has\r\na station on the Harpenden and Hemel Hempstead branch of the Midland\r\nRailway. The manor of Redbourn was given to St Albans’ Abbey in the\r\nreign of Edward the Confessor. The church, which is some distance from\r\nthe main street, was dedicated between 1094 and 1109, but the chancel\r\nappears to have been rebuilt about 1340. Near Church End are the\r\nancient earthworks known as the Aubreys. (pp. 12, 67, 72, 126.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRickmansworth (5627), at the junction of the Colne, Gade, and Chess\r\nrivers, is a town in the south-western corner of the county, close to\r\nthe Bucks and Middlesex borders. It has several ancient almshouses,\r\nof which one dates from 1680. Immediately to the south-east is Moor\r\nPark, the seat of Lord Ebury, where Lord Anson formerly lived. This\r\nonce belonged to the abbots of St Albans, but was given by Henry VII to\r\nthe Earl of Oxford, and in the reign of Henry VIII was the property of\r\nCardinal Wolsey. The present house is of comparatively modern date. The\r\nBury is an excellent specimen of an early seventeenth century mansion.\r\nThe church appears to have been rebuilt in the fifteenth century.\r\nRickmeresworth was the old name of the town. There are a number of\r\nmanors in the parish. (pp. 20, 31, 71, 73, 131, 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyston (3517) is situated on the Icknield Way, actually on the\r\nCambridgeshire border, and is served by a station on the Cambridge\r\nbranch of the Great Northern. The town, which has a market, stands just\r\nat the foot of the chalk downs; it has the honour of giving the name\r\nto one of the species, or races, of British birds, to wit, the Royston\r\ncrow. The church is that of an Augustinian priory now demolished. James\r\nI had a hunting seat here. (pp. 32, 33, 45, 93, 128.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSt Albans (16,019), situated about twenty miles north-west of London by\r\nrail, enjoys the distinction of being the only town in Hertfordshire\r\nentitled to style itself a “city.” It is the direct modern successor of\r\nthe Roman city of Verulamium, lying on the opposite side of the Ver,\r\nand itself dates from Saxon times, its ancient monastery having been\r\nfounded by the Mercian king Offa II in 793, in memory of Alban, the\r\nfirst English Christian martyr. The city has a mayor and corporation,\r\nand was formerly a parliamentary borough in its own right, although\r\nat the present day it forms the centre of an electoral district\r\nreturning one member to the House of Commons. It is also the centre of\r\nthe western division of Hertfordshire;--a division corresponding in\r\nthe main to the old Liberty of St Albans, the area lying within the\r\njurisdiction of the abbot. Quarter-sessions for the western division of\r\nthe county are held in the Court House, and likewise petty-sessions for\r\nthe St Albans division of the county, as well as city petty-sessions\r\nfor St Albans itself. At these last the city magistrates sit; the cases\r\nbeing brought before them by the local police force, which is distinct\r\nfrom that of the county. The city is the see of the bishopric of St\r\nAlbans, and its crowning glory is its Abbey, now raised to the dignity\r\nof a cathedral. Offa’s abbey was attacked and plundered by the Danes,\r\nand a rebuilding of the monastic church was contemplated by Ealdred,\r\nthe eighth abbot, who collected building materials from Verulam. The\r\nlong-deferred work, on a new site, was however not undertaken till the\r\ntime of Paul of Caen, the first Norman abbot (1077–93). This abbot\r\nrebuilt the church and nearly all the monastic buildings with the\r\nmaterials collected by his predecessor; and apparently made a clean\r\nsweep of the original structures. Although the fabric appears to have\r\nbeen completed by Abbot Paul, the consecration did not take place till\r\n1115. Between 1195 and 1214 Abbot John de Cella commenced a new west\r\nfront, but only part of the original design was carried out. In 1257\r\nthe eastern end was in a dangerous condition, and the two easternmost\r\nbays were pulled down; and eventually a presbytery and a Lady Chapel\r\nwith vestibule were added. Extensive alterations and rebuilding were\r\ncarried out previous to 1326, and again between 1335 and 1340. Other\r\nworks were carried out by John de Wheathampstead between 1451 and\r\n1484, including the rebuilding of St Andrew’s chapel. In 1553 the\r\nabbey was sold to the Mayor and Burgesses as a parish church, when\r\nthe Lady Chapel was cut off from the rest of the building by a public\r\npassage and used as a grammar school. This passage remained till\r\nabout 1870, when the Lady Chapel was once more rejoined to the main\r\nfabric. About this time a restoration of portions of the building was\r\nundertaken by a county committee, when the low-pitched roof of the\r\nnave was replaced by a high-pitched one on the lines of a much earlier\r\nstructure. Soon after, the tower was in danger of collapsing, owing\r\nto crush in the supporting pillars, and the whole structure had to be\r\nshored up previous to underpinning. Finally, the late Lord Grimthorpe\r\nundertook the completion of the “restoration,” which was carried out\r\nin substantial but drastic style. His most notable work comprised\r\nthe complete rebuilding of the west front in a peculiar style, the\r\nrepointing of the tower, and the replacing of its brick turrets by\r\nstone “pepper-pots.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shrine of St Amphibalus, St Albans’ Abbey]\r\n\r\nThe clock-tower in the centre of the city, from which the curfew was\r\nrung till the sixties, is another interesting building, as is also the\r\nold gateway of the monastery, now used as a grammar school. Near by the\r\ncity are the ruins of Sopwell nunnery. The city has three parishes,\r\nthose of the Abbey, St Peter, and St Michael, but it is also extending\r\ninto the parish of Sandridge. On the further side of the Ver is\r\nsituated St Stephen’s. St Albans is rapidly increasing as a residential\r\ndistrict, and also as a manufacturing centre, a number of industrial\r\nestablishments from London having been recently set up in its environs.\r\nStraw-plait still remains, however, the chief trade, although the\r\nactual plaiting of the straw has been killed by foreign competition. A\r\nmarket is held every Saturday. St Albans has a museum, unfortunately\r\nnot restricted to local antiquities and natural history objects. There\r\nare three railway stations, one on the Midland, the second the terminus\r\nof a branch line from the North-Western at Watford, and the third that\r\nof a branch of the Great Northern from Hatfield. St Peter’s church\r\nstands on the site of a Saxon church built in the latter half of the\r\ntenth century; this was replaced in less than 200 years by a Norman\r\nedifice, remains of which were found during the alterations carried out\r\nby the late Lord Grimthorpe. St Michael’s church contains Bacon’s tomb.\r\n\r\nTwo notable battles were fought at St Albans during the Wars of\r\nthe Roses. In 1455 the Yorkists and in 1461 the Lancastrians were\r\nvictorious. (pp. 14, 18, 35, 57, 59, 60, 61, 71, 72, 75, 80, 81, 82,\r\n84, 94, 98, 102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 123, 124, 126, 128, 130, 137, 138,\r\n140, 141, 142, 149.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSawbridgeworth (2085), pronounced Satsworth, is a town on the eastern\r\nborder of the county, to the south of Bishop’s Stortford, with a\r\nstation on the Great Eastern Railway. It was originally known as\r\nSabricstworth, being the seat of the family of Say, or de Say. It has a\r\nhistory dating from the Conquest. (pp. 113, 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShenley (1120) a village about four miles to the southward of St\r\nAlbans; the manor in the time of Stephen belonged to the de Mandeviles,\r\nwho had also the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandon (1577), a village and manor, with a station on the Great\r\nEastern Railway about midway between Buntingford and Stanstead Abbots.\r\nStandon Lordship was the seat of the Lords Aston of Forfar, who\r\ninherited it from the Sadler family. The living originally belonged to\r\nthe Knights Templars.\r\n\r\n\r\nStanstead Abbots (1484), now a parish and manor, but formerly a\r\nborough, is a village lying east of Hertford, near St Margaret’s\r\nstation on the Great Eastern Railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nStevenage (3957), a market-town on the Great North Road and Great\r\nNorthern Railway, between Welwyn and Hitchin. The town originally stood\r\nnear to the church of St Nicholas, now half-a-mile distant; but after a\r\ndisastrous fire, a new settlement sprang up on each side of the North\r\nRoad, which runs to the south-west of the old church. The fortieth,\r\nand last, abbot of St Albans was Richard Boreham de Stevenage, elected\r\nin 1538, and dismissed the following year on the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries. Elmwood House, now pulled down, was the home of Lucas, the\r\nHertfordshire hermit. (pp. 14, 39, 116, 128, 129.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTring (4349) forms the extreme western outpost of Hertfordshire, being\r\nsituated in the peninsula projecting from this part of the county into\r\nthe heart of Buckinghamshire. It has a station on the North-Western\r\nRailway some considerable distance from the town itself; and of late\r\nyears has become well-known in the scientific world on account of\r\nthe private natural history museum established by the Hon. Walter\r\nRothschild in Tring Park, the seat of Lord Rothschild. Tring was\r\nformerly one of the centres of the straw-plait industry. (pp. 18, 42,\r\n46, 47, 54, 72, 90, 99, 105.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWaltham Cross (5291), a town on the Essex border of the county, with a\r\nstation on the Great Eastern Railway, which takes its name from one of\r\nthe crosses erected at the resting-places on the funeral route of Queen\r\nEleanor from Grantham. (pp. 124, 125.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWare (5573), an ancient town to the north-east of Hertford, situated on\r\nthe river Lea (which is here navigable), and on a branch of the Great\r\nEastern Railway. Ware, which is associated with the story of “John\r\nGilpin,” is the chief centre of the malting industry in the county; the\r\ngrant of a market was made by King Henry III in the year 1254. (pp. 5,\r\n44, 70, 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWatford (29,327) is by far the largest town in the county, being the\r\nonly one with a population which exceeded 20,000 at the census of\r\n1901. It is situated in the south-western corner of the county, and is\r\ntraversed by the Colne; it has a station on the North-Western Railway,\r\nfrom which a branch line runs to St Albans. A market has existed since\r\nthe time of Henry II, and is stated to have been granted by Henry I.\r\nWatford played an important part in Wat Tyler’s rising. The Grove, the\r\nseat of the Earls of Clarendon, and Cassiobury, that of the Earls of\r\nEssex, are situated in the vicinity of the town. Watford is the centre\r\nof the West Herts parliamentary division and has numerous mills and\r\nfactories. The parish church contains some magnificent monuments by\r\nNicholas Stone. (pp. 6, 31, 34, 44, 99, 122, 123, 131, 132, 141.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWatton or Watton-at-Stone (710), a village in the valley of the Beane,\r\nnear the centre of the county, taking its name from the number of\r\nsprings in the neighbourhood--_Wat_, in Saxon, signifying a moist\r\nplace. Watton, which was in existence as a manor in the time of the\r\nConqueror, was the home of the ancient family of Boteler, whose seat\r\nwas the present Woodhall Park, now the property of the Abel Smith\r\nfamily. Near by is the manor house of Aston Bury, a fine example of\r\na sixteenth century house, also once belonging to the Botelers, with\r\ntall, twisted chimneys, a magnificent staircase, and an upper room\r\noccupying the whole width of the building. (p. 113.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWelwyn (1660), a village on the Great Northern Railway between Hatfield\r\nand Stevenage. Young, who was born near Bishop’s Waltham in Hampshire,\r\nbecame Rector of the place, wrote his _Night Thoughts_ here, and is\r\nburied in the churchyard. Two centuries ago Welwyn was celebrated for\r\nits chalybeate springs. (pp. 62, 128, 149.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWheathampstead (2405), a village in the valley of the Lea, between\r\nLuton and Hatfield, with a station on the Luton and Dunstable branch of\r\nthe Great Northern Railway. The parish originally included Harpenden,\r\nwhich was separated about 1860. One of the oldest buildings is\r\nWheathampstead Place, or Place Farm, which dates back to the time of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and has some fine Tudor chimneys; it was formerly the\r\nproperty of the Brockett family, whose monuments are in the church. The\r\nchurch itself, which is a cruciform edifice with a central tower, is\r\ndedicated to St Helen, and was judiciously restored in the sixties; the\r\nchancel with its three beautiful lancet windows was built about 1230,\r\nthe tower was rebuilt towards the close of the thirteenth century, and\r\nthe north transept between 1330–40. The parish includes the manors of\r\nMackery End and Lamer; the latter taking its name from the de la Mare\r\nfamily, by whom it was held in the fourteenth century. Lamer House was\r\nrebuilt about 1761.
